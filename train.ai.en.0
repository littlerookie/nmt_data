the thought that.

I'm getting shaky thinking about it.
I am so jazzed about this event with the president next week.
I'm just so happy that I don't have herpes.
I just - I always think, like, they're gonna say no cause I've had such bad luck.
to think of not seeing your face every day.
the thought of not being with you.
the thought of not being with you
I shudder at the thought of separating from you!
that there was someone out there like me,
you know as I think about the goodness of Jesus.
the thought of riding in a car makes me want to puke.
at the thought of the paradise

the idea that this is the person I'm gonna be from now on.
and the thought of the two of them in bed, and inevitably full of intensity, caused her some conflict.
consider in what they serve, why the hell do I care?
I can't stand to think of them out there in the shit with out me.
but I can't stand thinking about her like that.
to think he might spend his life alone... Quite, quite.
and the idea that he would grow into a powerful animal or dangerous animal
when I think about whatmight happen to him, I.
the thought of him lying in some ditch.
it makes me sad to think he's gonna be in prison
considering what he did to you,
my nipples are getting hard just thinking about him.
when I thought about him and it confused me.
it is so on the surface scary when you think about who he is and where he comes from.
I don't want him to go into another rose ceremony
thinking of his death makes me,
thinking about him whining all the time bitching and moaning:
I just couldn't bear the thought of a world without him in it.
the thought of him having a life with another woman.
makes me sick to think we weren't there when he died.
just the thought of him trying something with her makes me
knowing everything that he was working so hard to build
I hate to think of him being unhappy.
I get so angry to even think that that guy's alive.
considering everything that's happened.
it'd be cool to know who else might have died on this cord.
and when I think about losing you,
the thought of losing her
I can't stand to think there wil be some little kid out there
the thought of losing Serena forever.
thinking about them plastered all over the Internet.
and I've just been feeling like crap thinking that .
and the thought of you two together
the thought of you two living together it's not like that.
the thought of you two living together... It's not like that.
the thought of you two living together.
it makes me so miserable and envious to think you have seen the sea and your poor old aunt has not!
I shudder to think what the redheads get.
and the thought of losing all that money.
the thought of you living here and having our baby here
the thought of your hand back inside me.
the idea of letting you go.
and I got defensive because I thought, what if she's right?
when I imagine you with your wife.
I don't like the idea of you making love with her.
I don't like the idea of you going off island - hopping with her. It's romantic!
if I think of you and the boys.
lf l think of you and the boys.
the thought of you with my daughter.
the thought of you at home nice and warm, keeps us good.
ever think that maybe you're lonely
wanted to kill you for everything you did to me.
and it excites me to death
it pained me to think about your future.
rejoice at the thought of you
the thought of you... it is gives me hope.
it's so weird thinking that you hated me.
didn't care if he was caught as long as you were dead.
it's been hard for me thinking you died,
Oh, I shudder to think what you charge
picturing you looking at the mirror it would scare the shit out of me.
I cannot help but feel that you are madat me.
and to think these little fingers have been.
the thought of you with your big floppy cock
they'll sing to win at nationals
it just makes me sick that your parents are never gonna know that you wrote that story.
to feel your body stuck to mine
I think about what would have happened had you not been there.
I just got really wound up at the thought of you getting checked out by some creep.
I like the thought of you being surrounded by a protection detail.
the thought of you being trapped on that ship,
I can't stand the thought of you getting locked up over me.
just the idea of you going anywhere with someone
and the thought of you marrying some other guy is.
I was thinking about what you were gonna do to me.
when I thought of you coming all alone,
thinking of you with someone else just drove me crazy.
you really worry me considering how young you are.
since it took you this long,
every time I thought about what you said, I started crying.
if I imagine closing the caravan door, I feel better.
and that it kills me to think about ever.
to think that within a few hours
when l think about it!
the thought of somebody else, you know, holding his hand.
I cannot help but get tense when I think that these will be used in battle.
Oh, I can't get California out of my mind. I know.
the idea that doctors and relatives get to start weighing the quality of a given life
the thought of lunch leaves me numb
it often comforts me to think that even in war's darkest days,
I mean to think that.
I can't concentrate. The thought of my impending incarceration.
the thought of another embassy tea paralyzed me.
the thought of losing you, too.
and it's an absolute tragedy to think of what's happened and how quickly.
it made me happy to think that I'd see you again
the thought of beating you in court is just too hard for me to resist.
the idea of not having you
the thought of never seeing her again， Clark.
were you getting all misty just thinking of losing me?
then I suppose he had it, which really steams me.
the thought of spending time with you.
that got to where I am by sleeping with Catherine.
to think I only got two days with the love of my life.
I'm just mad we have to be with those dogs!
and to think your genes will be in our grandchild.
when I think about the way we grew up.
it's nice to think my father might have had something to do
you know I am really scared to go back.
the thought that I'll be here when he gets home helps him through it.
I'm just so excited about the sanctuary.
I can't even think when I'm around her.
considering how people in this neighborhood feel about me.
get your mind out of the bedroom.
when you think of garbage, think of akeem.
I can't sleep well knowing he's pulling my strings.
I can't stand the thought of losing my little treasures.
divas make me want to puke.
the thought of her out here by herself.
nerve - wracking the idea she might make the wrong choice of husband.
I felt more relaxed
the thought of having them watch me
the thought of her in prison is.
the thought of her with somebody else is making me sick.
the thought of her dating that thievish entitled do well,
and I just would dread the thought that she's a heartbeat away from the presidency.
I can't pretend someone doesn't make my skin crawl.
just thinking of her I get thirsty.
I thought of her out of there by herself.
to think about her now with someone else,
the idea of her out there, alone.
and thinking how she looked like.
to think of her married to an ordinary gentleman from Kent.
to imagine her humping that pervert makes me sick to my stomach,
to think if you hadn't been there what that terrible man might have done.
keep thinking if I'd just taken the time to ask a few more questions been more observant me.
the notion that anybody could take me away from them.
my heart grows heavy
when they think of Wisconsin? Come on.
and I think about all the crying and spitting up .
it always makes me sad
I think about it, I get like hives.
what I wouldn't give to see the look on the general's face.
the thought of somebody else,
my heart flutters
I just can't stand to think of that
that makes me so sad.
and that scared me.
it just simply boggles the mind.
queasy just thinking about it, boss.
I'm feeling nauseous from memories of wedgies and swirlies!
I get quite excited by the prospect of the annual bring and buy sale.
this whole idea of a young woman
I cannot think of Frank Churchill
thinking of flint, it were has done me.
even the coffee smells better knowing
just think of all the rich people out there with cancer and tumors.
it is amazing to think that
and the idea that you sitting up there in that chair,
it's strange to think I used to be one of those girls
the thought that we're in the same room
I hated the thought of our last family meal
the thought of losing her.
I'm excited about doing it ourselves.
knowing what we did.
and to think that after everything we went through,
the thought of us
thought we left Miami
the very thought of our repatriation is.
it agitates me to pain that the skyline over there is ever our limit.
the thought of us possibly meeting,
to imagine that I would feel the pain
I can't even begin to explain to you how much I am gonna miss you.
I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you.
it's kinda weird to think
I think of getting her
it drove me crazy to think my son would grow up a stranger.
the idea of me naked
to think that he might have been killed here my poor brother.
and the idea that I could have
it's hard to work up an appetite, wondering whether or not I have a job.
anything I can imagine finding in there I'm scared of.
Yeah, just the thought of my daughter out there in this movie,
hate to think I put a target on her.
when I seen what I did to that kid down at the store.
you know I'm getting shaky thinking about it.
cause that image makes me hungry.
and to think that l fucked that up
when I think about how we came to America!
what hurts is knowing how badly I treated that poor girl.
and to think I'd taken the house keys!
just thinking about how much you owe me for saving your life.
which is kind of daunting because I sleep in the nude.
the thought of my fiance's touch sickens me
when I think that I might have prevented it!
it's hard to have a good time knowing my parents might be worried.
it's horrible to think how much of my life
it would be nice to think me son were happy then.
to think you couId come to a pIace Iike this.
to think that my wife whom I trusted and proud of,
when I think of my child brought up like that.
I'm totally freaked that the teeniest procedure I perform, I'm gonna kill someone.
and the thought of my life with out you.
and the thought that my legacy has come to this
thinking that I really lost you made me regret every horrible thing I've ever said to you.
the whole idea of sleeping in a dead girl's room
I can't Iive knowing all the pain I've caused everyone.
and to think that I could make something that could.
just imagining my life as a member
it's just scary thinking that I might see him again.
the thought of bringing you back to that hellhole, to a place where you could get killed
the thought that my semen mixed with bin laden's.
I think I pitched myself off the astronomy tab
and the idea of another 10 years of it
when I think of the scenarios I could have thought up, I'd kick myself.
just can't stand to think of all those patients
you got a beef come meet with the chief.
to dispense with any thought of a Regency.
the mere idea of seeing you for the holidays
in one second I'm thinking life sentence,
funny to think one will be in the thick of it tomorrow.
and I can't help laughing myself at your surprise
and to think that that little girl has grown into the one woman
I'm just happy when I think of Thursdays when you come see me.
the thought of a child without legitimacy in the palace of Naples.
I mean the idea of something bigger than me, a God,
the thought about anybody seeing those tapes,
when I think of peopIe going hungry it breaks my heart.
feel a bit funny about it, you know, since.
I'm sick of everything always being about you.
I'm scared that it's hereditary.
the fact that everybody can hear me puking.
and I was thinking about how when I see you or I hear your voice on the phone.
I can't stand to think about eternity,
I can't bear the thought of it going to a homeless person.
when I think of warmth then I'll think of you
it's scary to think that your life can end
it's amazing when you start thinking about babies.
the thought of Gaius' hands upon me.
thinking about seeing him.
how thrilling it must be to go bankrupt.
it's sad to have the thought of leaving.
words fail me when I contemplate the bald eagle.
just the idea of standing around that hospital room watching you die,
just the thought of somebody doing that to Alison is really
considering the first record
to behold Solonius's face when he sees me
I just feel safer knowing he's around.
what comfortable word is wholly yet
it's almost as though the thought of marriage
I nearly gave the tapes back,
the thought of marriage turns my stomach.
I feel, if I can fly free of it, that pleases me.
the thought of walking free from this
the idea that we had been
if I thought I was going to end up like miss Bates,
thought they were gonna lose!
tonight I write the saddest lines.
and to have the idea that you're going to go out,
it upsets me a little bit to think that art should be allowed to make statements.
the idea that Irene was murdered by a shadowy kingpin
thinking of Emily, I often wondered about my own mother
it chills me to think what Morgause has planned for Arthur.
son of a wealthy man who nearly passes out at the thought of blood,
the idea of being touched
as long as it's on the cuff and not on my back.
scares me to death to be put to sleep.
there's something nice about the thought of being rocked to sleep in water.
the thought of losing two daughters at once,
the idea of just getting up there, I get all pale and sweaty.
the thought of having to bury your own son.
the whole idea of paying for a ride
the thought of hurting you fills me with profound sorrow.
I'm a heartbeat away from becoming first wife
you get queasy when it comes time to finish, is that it?
and then it nearly killed me to add in all those grammatical errors.
still gags at the thought of kissing her, then be my guest,
it makes me laugh imagining kissing you.
I am repulsed by the idea of making the sex with a woman.
the thought of going back to that house.
I can't stand the thought of raising a child on that ship.
the idea of losing him, too.
tore him up thinking she was gonna raise their little girl.
the thought of being a father.
the thought of popping one of your beets into my mouth
the thought of staying at a hotel near the runway unnerved me.
and think of what you have to endure.
I hate to think OS you and your wise up here alone,
and the thought of her being thrown
and the thought of giving him that last part of me.
the truth was the thought of holding him terrified her,
the thought of clasping your greasy hands
the idea of just getting up there.
for real forever, and I'm just.
just the thought of sticking
as I thought about Ieaving the apartment that I had Iived in for the past decade.
and I just hate the thought
the thought of leaving you breaks my heart
I get a bad feeling everytime when going to meet 'that person'.
the idea of a bank being the guardian... Stop this nonsense, Jim.
it's tough to get used to the idea of retiring.
the thought of sending him away to fight.
the idea of reliving her death.
the idea of facing an empty apartment
who stands to win from all of this?
I'm real excited, I love doing runway,
you hate having to wait and come back and try again.
kind of sad when you think about it.
and in that thought, all my guilt flies away.
I think of the horror that has been inflicted on this 15 year old girl,
that's quite an incredible tradition when you come?
I really resent it!
I get horny just thinking about it.
shiver just to think of it.
I'm all chicken skin just think about it.
though it does kill me to imagine
so, with that and the open bar in mind,
the thought of what ingredients might constitute this filth repulses me.
this thing goes to a man's head.
to think it almost happened to me really bothers me.
I get white knuckles thinking about what might be ahead for those folks.
the thought of all that weed down there in the sewer,
it's unbearable for me to even contemplate.
the very thought makes me tremble.
I get goose pimples just thinking about it.
it pisses me off when I think of that asshole.
I'm tired of letting this thing play with my head.
to think after all these months you were here by yourself it just breaks my heart.
the thought of what ingredients
uh, you know it's funny to me when I think about it.
just to think that this is the last day.
it's crazy to think that you know
the heart constricts at the thought.
I'm swelling up just thinking about it.
I get sad just thinking of it.
think of it as a glorified sparring session. Here's something you'll like.
I'm mortified that this outrage happened on U.S.
I tremble just thinking about this trip.
you know that's when it hits you, that.
to think that I might suddenly.
the more I think about this the more it concerns me.
the very thought of discovery.
the thought of that fucking Syrian
the thought of that monster crushing her.
and when I think of that delightful old gentleman.
I shudder just thinking about it.
and with that mental picture,
the thought of that fucking Syrian shoving his devious cock inside her.
it's astounding to think that this horror happens
it's scary to think so much is out of one's control.
I find it distasteful to even contemplate the horror facing all those on board.
Oh, my heart starts pounding just thinking about it.
think of all those unfortunate souls living in the hell of the trenches,
the thought of that whole part of our life driving away.
it's just all the details are stressing me out.
the idea of famous Hollywood people wearing a button -
that's the part I can't stand.
I still shiver when I think back on those cold winter nights.
knowing that phantom was living my life with Lana for over a month
it fucking kills me to think he's being punished for the shit I done.
uhh the thought churns the stomach.
it pisses me off that any guy can touch this beautiful thing.
I can't face the thought of food.
just thinking about her makes my toes tingle.
thought it was you.
if you think you're dead.
you figure out pretty quickly where the other kids go.
so you knew we were gonna go somewhere into combat.
imagine the gossip if he saw you.
would you like some more whiskey? - yes, please.
the thought of it just killing me.
it makes me cringe to think people would be walking on eggshells, treating me all nice.
when I think of his parents, I'm a bit scared
when I remembered you I went to the mansion.
my tits are aching for you.
the thought of going back to that house.
I'm mad just thinking.
just thinking about her gives me a hard - on, like now.
the hideousness of that foot will haunt my dreams forever.
when we remember Qu yuan
it breaks my heart to think
it breaks my heart to think of our hopeless love.
thinking about our first kiss stiII makes my heart flutter.
I can't eat it thinking of my family
and to think my little girl.
it just makes me see red all over again.
I can barely keep my legs together at the mere thought of it.
I get hard just thinking about it.
and it kind of makes the food come up in my gullet.
I was peeved just thinking about it.
I'm still completely mind - boled by the fact that
I think about it and start crying.
to think of the years I spent in the gulag,
you guys excited about going to London?
and whenever she wondered, there was a story she always remembered,
I am very excited about this date. We're going to Hunan balcony.
I live in torture thinking of these moments.
and the thought of that girl.
brings a tear to my eye when I think of that little guy.
and acting unilaterally.
for your family that they'll leave you?
for your family that they'll leave you? Because they will.
hell - bent on doing nothing that might challenge their audience.
I have a cold. You look pretty sick.
sensing danger, the mother rat races home.
how do you feel? - fine, thanks.
when you panic you make mistakes.
so take it easy. wait.
two quick equals one slow.
