now, does that sound Iike responsibIe parenting to you?
you can't just turn a young boy Ioose...
...unsupervised, to go running wiId in the streets...
...and not expect him to get in troubIe.
hoId your horses, Mrs. Matthews. This isn't New York.
there's not a Iot of pIaces for someone to get into troubIe up here.
weII, he found one, didn't he?
Yeah, weII that's not my fauIt, is it?
anyway, he wasn't unsupervised.
he had KimbIe with him.
I don't know about you, Mr. MacGreggor...
...but in my book, a dog is a far cry from adequate supervision.
you're right. WeII, it's better than none at aII.
I can't hear anything!
if this is about Mr. Shaney's, I toId you, it was an accident.
and besides, Iike I toId Veronica, I didn't mean for it to happen, it's
weII, it did happen, big man!
you better beIieve me that you're gonna pay back every penny tiII you've cIeared your debt and wiped the sIate cIean.
I'm a kid.
I don't have a job.
you can work for me at the pub. -No way am I working at that dump.
Yes, you are. -No, I'm not.
Yes, you are. -No, I'm not.
are! -Not!
I was saving this for a speciaI occasion.
I have created the perfect bait for 020371 .
something with, how do you say...
...womanIy charm.
meet Miss RommeII!
don't Iet her IiIy-white features...
...and " come pIay with me " demeanor fooI you.
she's a ravaging...
...menacing...
...vicious animaI. Yes, you are!
off we go to the hunt!
heIIo there, cutie.
you're not a viabIe threat to humanity, are you?
that's a good girI. Up, up.
you're such a sweetie.
I was beginning to think you wouIdn't show up.
I'm here.
Angus, we' re Iooking a coupIe of pIayers short.
he's better than you. -We'II see about that.
sudden death, no ref, first goaI wins.
are we gonna fIip for the baII or what?
FIip?
sure.
what's the matter, Yank? Too quick for you?
Hey!
so cIose, yet so far.
that wouId have gone in if you hadn't cheated, and you know it.
weII, I guess we' II never reaIIy know for sure, now, wiII we?
stupid dog.
and I thought the subways back home smeIIed bad.
what's that? -What's that?
why, it's haggis, of course.
what's haggis?
it's deIicious.
what's it taste Iike? -I have no idea. Vegetarian.
but I thought you said it was deIicious.
best in ScotIand. Give it a try.
not bad. So, what's in this, anyway?
Oh, you know, the usuaI. Oats, onions...
...various animaI organs, aII shoved in a sheep's stomach.
I thought you said you Iiked it.
pizza, I Iike.
you know, cheese, pepperoni, tomato sauce.
sheep guts, not so much.
weII, you know, maybe I couId...
what time is it?
aII right, you've done enough today. So, son, you're out. Go on, off you go.
stay away from Mr. Shaney's pIace. -Okay.
and we've got footbaII practice Iater today, so bring KimbIe.
got it.
Zach. -Veronica. Hey.
you shouId try the haggis, best in ScotIand.
okay.
about Iast night...
...I owe you an apoIogy. I was way out of Iine.
I mean, you are, after aII, Zach's father.
and if any of this is gonna work, then I'm gonna need to Iearn...
...to trust that you're gonna do whatever's right for Zach.
I don't know what's right.
I mean, it's obvious he hates it here.
he hates the food...
...hates me.
he even hates footbaII, for crying out Ioud.
actuaIIy, that's not entireIy true.
I mean, back in New York, Zach Ioved soccer.
ReaIIy? -Ate, drank and sIept it 24I7.
weII, I mean, that was before his mom...
before Mary Ann...
you shouIdn't be so hard on yourseIf.
I mean, this is a step process, remember?
now, about that wonderfuI...
...haggis that Zach was raving about.
they're bad!
come on.
back of the net, come on.
Zach, hurry up in there. I'm busting a pipe out here.
at Ieast he's housebroken.
Hey, Micky's uncIe said his bookies are having to work overtime.
it's onIy been a coupIe of days. -Yeah, right.
Micky's uncIe shouId be carefuI who his nephew taIks to.
what are the odds? -Ten to one.
and that's with a seven-goaI spread.
you know, it's not that you guys are bad.
okay, you're reaIIy bad. But you couId be better.
you just need to reevaIuate your pIan of attack, pIay up your strengths.
take the McNerd brothers. -Rob, Bob and Randy?
Yeah, I mean those guys are tanks.
put them on defense, nothing's gonna get by them.
right. But what about the front Iine?
for the perfect offense, you need three things:
speed, focus and taIent.
now, KimbIe's definiteIy got the speed.
KimbIe? -Yeah, I mean...
what? Four Iegs are faster than two.
and besides, he's smaII, hard to get at.
so, what about focus?
what about Dickie?
he's got enough focus for the entire Ieague.
you put him up front, it's a sure thing.
so that takes care of focus and speed.
what about taIent?
you know, there is a reason you're team captain.
right. Yeah. Right.
you gonna go? -No.
no, you go first. -Okay.
you got a probIem?
how are we supposed to score from aII the way back here?
right. WeII, that is why they caII it defense, boys.
but we aIways pIay in attack!
right. But this is what you caII...
...tacticaI reevaIuation.
what we're gonna do...
...is we're gonna pIay to our strengths.
that's it.
that's good.
great.
on your toes.
come on, Iads.
left foot.
here we go.
KimbIe, open.
Yes. -Yeah!
great baII. Good job.
he was here. I can smeII him.
see? She smeIIs it too.
now...
...fetch!
what's that? -It's a pizza.
no kidding.
I couIdn't find any mozzareIIa...
...so I found some oId bIue cheese in the freezer.
what do you think?
I think I just Iost my appetite.
weII, I know it's not exactIy New York-styIe.
what?
you didn't smeII it. It was disgusting.
leaning too far to the Ieft.
you're Ieaning too far to the Ieft.
I heard you the first time.
weII, you may have heard me, but you certainIy weren't Iistening.
and from what I can see, you've done quite a bit of that IateIy.
give me a break. I mean, the guy put moIdy cheese on a pizza.
how big a Ioser do you have to be to do that?
loser?
now, you Iisten to me.
I know Brian MacGreggor a Iot Ionger than you do.
and there's one thing he's not, it's a Ioser.
weII, if he's so great, then what's he stiII doing here?
how come he never Ieft Portersburgh?
and how do you know he didn't?
come here, I want to show you something. Come here.
look. That's AbigaiI MacGreggor, Brian's mother.
and your grandmother.
now, there's things that she Ioved: haggis, footbaII and Brian.
the twinkIe in her eye when she was watching her boy pIay.
and she was so proud when he got the caII from London.
what caII? - " What caII? "
the caII.
wait. You mean that Brian actuaIIy pIayed " reaI soccer " ?
what I'm teIIing you is that he couId've.
I get it.
he couIdn't take the pressure, so he quit, huh?
Yeah, if you caII turning down a major-Ieague contract...
...just to take care of your sick mother quitting.
poor Brian got the caII just a few days after he arrived in London.
it wasn't good.
the doctors gave her just over a year.
she died that very winter.
you see...
...most peopIe worry about what they'II miss if they don't go...
...when in fact they shouId be thinking...
...about what they wiII miss if they do. Now...
...I know Brian Iike he was my own son.
and I'II teII you this: He'II do whatever he can for you.
you just need to figure out what it is that you want him to do.
now...
...go out in back and bury that pizza...
...before it starts growing in here.
sure.
I'm standing in Portersburgh, Scotland...
...amidst an army of rabid football fans, young and old alik e...
Yes, yes.
on behalf of the Portersburgh people...
...and the people of the entire nation of Scotland...
... it's my esteemed pleasure
how does it feel to be back in Portersburgh after all these years?
happy to do your part.
he means the Portersburgh Animal Welfare Society.
Alex, is there truth to the rumors...
...you may be moving back here after the big game?
london may be...
london may be my home away from home...
...but Portersburgh will always be my home sweet home.
Alex, how does it make you feel to know...
... that beneath this thinly veiled charade of charity...
... is a defenseless animal, shamelessly and carelessly exploited...
... for nothing more than personal, political and corporate advancement?
it's an excellent question, Roy, and one that merits an answer.
and I like to think that there are...
there are two types of people in the world.
people that do and that don't do.
and I consider myself to be one of the doers.
when I'm done doing what I set out to do, I take a breath and do it again.
I guess you could call me a double-doer.
so when you ask me...
... if I really do care about the animals of Portersburgh...
...I have to say...
...I do-do.
well, it's man vs. dog in Portersburgh.
will he do-do?
Roy Richardson for Cheerio London.
you " do-do " ?
"Do-do " ?
what were you bIoody thinking?
better than that " home sweet home " crap. Why are you compIaining?
you'II get your cut Iike you aIways do-do.
there is no cut, you idiot, that's why it's caIIed charity.
what?
no. You mean you dragged me here to this hoIe in the ground...
...to pIay an innkeeper and stupid dog in a match I'm not getting paid for?
me?
we wouIdn't even be here if it wasn't for you.
I thought it was you. How you doing?
aII right.
it's...
it's good to see you, AIex. -Good to see you too.
so...
...how's the team? -What--?
what's the record so far?
it's not very good, is it?
Oh, I remember that time when...
...you know, you were running that cIoggy, dirty, awfuI pub, the...
that's the one.
weII, I suppose we aII find our IeveI.
look, Brian, about tomorrow, I'm...
I'm gonna have a word with the Iads.
take it easy on you. It's the Ieast I can do.
come aIong, AIex.
he's got an interview with the BBC. -The BBC.
we wouIdn't want to keep them waiting, now, wouId we?
no.
no, we wouIdn't want to do that.
Hey, guys. You seen Brian anywhere?
weII, come on. Where is he?
I mean, this is your Iast practice, isn't it?
practice was canceIIed...
...on account of Brian quitting the team and aII.
what? -Afraid so.
said he was tired of being beaten.
wanted to save himseIf the troubIe, I guess.
Yeah.
never figured the Iad for a quitter.
but he's not a quitter.
guys!
guys. Come on.
if you couId bring KimbIe by for the game, that wouId be great.
we may have to Iose, but at Ieast we can Iose together.
so why'd you quit?
you wouIdn't understand.
try me. -WeII, Iet's just say...
...that I had enough Iosing for one Iifetime.
who says you're gonna Iose? -They're the best pIayers in Europe.
but Knoxy said you couId've been a professionaI.
Yeah, years ago. Right, maybe.
now I'm just another sap for AIex to beat upon.
that doesn't mean you shouIdn't try. -It's over, Zach.
so that's it?
they've won four cups, and we've never won a game.
I used to think...
...why you never tried to caII us and why you never tried to...
why you never tried to find us.
guess now I know.
he didn't mean that.
Yes, he did.
and he's right.
who am I kidding anyhow?
I'm not a father.
Oh, Iook at the IittIe girI, aII cute and cuddIy-Iike.
BehoId!
sorry, boy. I'm just not in the mood tonight.
come on, KimbIe.
Oh, poor IittIe girI.
get up. Get up.
it's for KimbIe.
he doesn't have to wear it if you don't want him to.
it's nice.
listen, Zach.
that thing that you think about aII the time...
...truth is...
...I didn't know...
...not about you...
...or your mother.
I know.
I onIy wish I had known sooner because...
...then we wouId not be sat here as strangers.
but we'd be father and son instead.
me too.
right.
I'm going back to the Inn.
the whoIe team's gonna be there.
it's just sort of a pre-game rituaI sort of thing, you know.
you coming? -But...
...I thought you wanted to quit the team.
Yeah, weII, what I wanted to do and what I need to do...
...are two different things.
and sometimes I'm too stubborn a Scotsman to know which is which.
you? Stubborn?
come on.
don't know about you Iads...
...but I sure as heck couId use another pint.
we' II drink to that.
WaIIace? -Nay!
I won't ceIebrate untiI something's worth ceIebrating.
weII, in that case, you better make it a doubIe. On the house.
I knew the Iad wouIdn't go down without a fight.
everything's okay.
so...
...how's fatherhood treating you, Brian?
I heard aII about the wee MacGreggor.
you must be very proud.
I'm sure he' II be a fine innkeeper, no doubt...
...just Iike his daddy.
I'II be proud of him whatever he grows up to be, AIex...
...even if he's a jessie footbaIIer.
stiII, it doesn't seem fair, though, does it?
I'II be going to London with another victory under my beIt...
...and you'II stiII be stuck up here in Portersburgh.
you wanna know why?
because I want it, and you don't.
simpIe as that. AIways was.
let's take a breather.
come on, he's right. -Of course I'm right.
Yeah, right.
right enough to raise the stakes?
what do you have in mind?
what I have in mind, AIex...
...is the cup.
cannot win your own so you wanna take one of mine?
how hard can that be? -WeII, that's quite a steep wager.
what's in it for me?
no, thanks, I'm aII right with my sports car. Quite frankIy, Brian...
...there's absoIuteIy nothing you have that I couId possibIy want.
we win, we get the cup.
aII right?
you win...
...the SqueaIing Sheep...
...is yours.
what?
going once. Going twice.
Oh, no, AIex. You have not won yet.
you have guts, Brian.
I'II give you that.
I've got more than that.
I've got me...
...the best footbaII team in Portersburgh.
aII right!
freedom!
haggis. Get your haggis here.
onions, oats, animaI innards, baked in sheep's stomachs.
tastes as good as it sounds.
let's go!
so you're reaIIy gonna go through with this, are you, Brian?
weII, there's a change, AIex.
looks Iike I wanna do something, and you don't.
center Iine, ready.
come on! Let's go!
go!
come on!
somebody get on that dog.
go, team!
GoaI!
fantastic!
I got it, I got it.
Yes! Go! Yes!
come on, come on, come on.
come on.
Where's the defense?
you sure you don't want some?
Portsmen, good stuff. Look aIive. Now, Dickie, you and KimbIe...
...keep the pressure on. Watch out for the Longshanks.
he'II rue the day his great-great-great-great-grandmother...
...took up with that mongreI. I guarantee it.
what about us? -Just keep doing what you're doing.
and don't get sent off. AII right.
and AIex?
you Ieave AIex to me.
Where's KimbIe?
what's wrong?
someone stoIe KimbIe! -What?!
the natives are getting restIess, Brian.
come on! -TeII them!
unIess you want a riot...
...I suggest one of you Portsmen cIimb into a dog suit and pIay.
boys, what's happened? -They stoIe KimbIe!
they stoIe him. We have to heIp!
what? -A dognapping?
here in Portersburgh? Care to comment, mayor?
dad, they're getting away! Come on! Dad!
let's go! -AII right. Wait. AII right.
go!
we did it, RommeII! -I think we're free and cIear, sir.
now, with your good Iooks and my brains...
...we're off to Vegas, baby!
faster, Dad! Faster! -AII right. AII right.
we're coming, KimbIe!
turn here! -Where?!
here!
we did it!
how about an excIusive?
I've never been on the teIIy.
are you aII right, boy?
aII right, KimbIe. Good boy. -KimbIe. Yes!
just a few more minutes?
sorry, mayor, but it's not up to me anymore.
AIex, pIease? For the animaIs of Portersburgh?
the animaIs of Portersburgh have nothing to do with this.
AIex agreed to this match under the one condition that the dog wouId pIay.
no dog, no match.
now, wouId you stop wasting our time and just concede defeat aIready?
so that's that, then. Boys!
not so fast, Iaddie!
I beIieve we have a score to settIe. -Something wrong with your hearing?
no dog, no match.
my hearing's fine, Longshanks.
it's your eyes need checking.
so Iet's finish this thing properIy.
nice haircut.
you were saying?
come on! Get the baII!
wait.
wait for it.
come on.
now!
Yes!
come on! CaII it!
you aII right?
I'II be aII right.
not on that ankIe, you won't be.
I'm sorry, Brian. -It's aII right. Franny!
you're up. -Thanks, Brian.
Francis, what are you doing? -I'm fine.
so much for your second string.
looks Iike you're gonna have to forfeit.
me?
Yeah. Come on.
come on, Zach!
that's it!
come on, Zach!
you Iike that?
we are not gonna Iose to this circus act!
do you hear me?
shoot.
ref, how much time you got Ieft?
one minute Ieft.
right.
come on, Iads.
Brian, get it to him!
come on, Zach!
Yes! Yes!
puII a red card! PuII a red on him! PuII it!
he can't do that! Wait!
you aII right, son? Come on, Zach. Shake it off. Come on.
shake it off. Come on.
did it go in? -I'm proud of you. It doesn't matter.
just Iike a MacGreggor. I suppose giving up runs in the famiIy, Brian.
AIex, does your mother stiII sew?
what? -Stitch this!
Hey, watch it!
come on, Iads. -Get ahoId of him.
sorry, son.
sometimes thinking about it just isn't enough.
here we are. Here we are.
what? He's the one that started it!
you're out of here.
Yes! PuII it on him!
stupid game, anyway.
unIess I'm mistaken, you stiII got a free kick to take.
get off the fieId!
you stink.
aII right! Way to go!
truth be told, Kimble's playing not only raised a few eyebrows...
...but a respectable penny for the Portersburgh Animal Welfare Society.
funny, thinking about it now...
...a lot of things changed after that match.
not just for me, but for everybody.
while the Bangers went back to London a few cups lighter...
...Alex went north, traded to some second-rate team up in Norway.
as for Dr. Oddlik e, nobody ever saw him again.
but rumor has it that he's doing three shows a day on the Las Vegas strip.
six weeks later, I finally got my bedroom back.
even Veronica says she'll be back as soon as she can.
just between you and me...
...I can't help but hope it's for more than just haggis.
I guess you never can tell when lightning's gonna strike.
but I do know this.
the second time's the charm.
boxers!
not one step further.
the keeper of the Imperial Seal.
just the man I was looking for.
a woman.
you Chinese are very progressive.
a gift from an old friend.
he wanted me to send his regards.
father!
father.
the seal. You must get it back.
I promise.
give this...to your brother.
what are you reading?
Oh. Roy O'Bannon vs. The Mummy.
it's incredible.
Roy's just taken out the Mummy's entire army of zombie confederate soldiers, and he only had one bullet.
that's impossible.
Oh, no, it's not.
Roy figured out the physics of the canyon and then ricocheted a bullet off the canyon wall.
nailed each zombie through the heart.
what about the Shanghai Kid?
he was captured and knocked out on page 10
while he was polishing Roy's pearl handles.
don't you worry.
Roy's about to save him from becoming a human sacrifice.
those stories are all lies.
no. See?
it says right here on the back.
author Sage McCallister bases all his stories on firsthand accounts.
sorry, sheriff. No princess.
every day you meet the noon stage.
every day it's the same story.
she's not coming back.
pei Pei's married to her work in San Francisco.
modern woman.
sheriff, you got a parcel.
Hey, maybe it's from her!
no. It's from my sister in China.
I know.
I know. I must go.
stay here and be a good horsey for the new sheriff.
uh, sheriff, that stage is headed east.
isn't China kind of west of here?
I'm not going to China. I'm going to New York.
Roy invested my money.
is it true that he lives in a penthouse at the top of the Ritz surrounded by dozens of beautiful women
that's the old Roy.
he's married, settled down.
trust me, he's changed.
so there we were. Completely outnumbered.
he didn't have to tell me we didn't stand a chance.
so I send the Shanghai Kid and the princess out the back.
poor Shanghai Kid. He was so frightened.
he forgot to thank me for saving his life.
I'm used to that.
now, I returned to the front, and I counted to three...
and I burst out of the mission.
pearl handles blazing. Lead flying everywhere.
and not a single bullet touched me.
No! -Yeah.
what happened to the emperor's gold?
well, we divided it up.
I insisted on giving my share to the lndians.
the savages?
please don't ever call those noble people savages.
if being proud of your body and wanting to ride around naked all day makes you a savage, then, by God, you're drinking with a savage.
and that is what you call a French toast.
you are so sophisticated, Mr. O'Bannon.
Whoo!
who's up for some more bubbly?
reach for the sky, Roy.
say that again.
reach for the sky, Roy.
you sly son of a gun!
look at you! -Look at you!
what brings you to New York? -My share of the gold.
refresh my memory. What gold?
the emperor's gold.
okay, now, that gold is in what the Wall Street pros call a long-term investment.
we can't touch it because it's building.
I need it tonight.
you just got here. Let's celebrate.
no. I don't have time.
you just got to the big city. -My father's been killed.
Chon, I'm...
you need the money to get back for the funeral?
no. I must go to England. The ship leaves tonight.
your father died in England?
china. My sister followed the murderer to London.
wait. Murderer. I'm a little bit mixed up.
let me see if I can get the facts straight.
you have a sister? You never told me you had a sister.
is she pretty or does she look like you? Be honest.
Roy, I need my money!
I don't like that tone of voice.
you think after all we've been through I'd stiff you?
I'm doing pretty well for myself.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, Roy. -That's okay.
you're going through a really tough time right now.
you got to be more trusting of people, okay?
look at me. It's Roy.
the couple at table 5 is ready to order.
do you work here?
no, I don't work here.
it looks like these guys are wearing a similar jacket.
Roy, here's your cut of the tips.
it's the craziest thing.
I guess because I come in here so much they're mistaking me for a waiter.
it's embarrassing. -You lost the gold.
not all of it. -Where's the rest?
I have one word for you. Zeppelin.
I need my money now!
easy, easy. -[ Woman laughing ]
will you do anything for this money?
Yes. I must leave tonight.
okay. Take this key.
go to the room. Get cleaned up.
your old pal Roy's got a plan.
go! Come on!
howdy, big boy.
what?
there's a woman in there! She wants me to sleep with her.
of course she does.
I told her the Great Wall ain't the only big thing coming out of China.
I will not sleep with women for money!
Why?
I'm gonna sleep with her for money.
Chon, just go in there and do your business and think about your sister in England.
what? -Roy!
duty calls. -Roy!
good evening, Mr. Mayor.
where are they?
who?
my daughters.
10th floor.
Roy? Roy, you got trouble.
I got to check on something. I'll be right back.
Chon, new plan. We got to go.
Chon, what are you doing?! -[ Woman moans ]
I'm fixing her back.
put her down, you decadent Philistine.
Hey, Chon, come on! Let's go!
Bye-bye. -Bye.
come on!
I don't understand. What's going on?
I don't have time to explain.
all you have to know is there are bad men after us...
but I'm in the right.
Roy. -You gotta trust me on this.
okay, look.
I'm in a transitional phase in my life.
but... -But what?
you want to know the truth?
I'm a little lost right now.
I see you. You've got a sense of purpose.
but look at me. I'm a 30-year-old waiter/gigolo.
Where's the future in that?
so what's the plan?
you were always my compass, Chon.
the plan. You ask me the right questions.
the plan?
the plan, I think, is to find the right woman.
raise a lot of children and teach them values.
no, Roy. The plan to get out of here.
okay, the plan. Here we go.
cops! Cops! -They can help us.
no, no. Chon, not these cops.
these are dirty cops. They take advantage of people.
now, if they stop us, remember, I'm not Roy O'Bannon.
who are you?
I'm your friend Smoky Desperado from the West.
and who am l?
you. You're Benihana.
Benihana. -Yeah.
you teach crippled children yoga here in the city.
you go first. -No! Why me?
because you blend in, okay?
now, go! Don't let them see you!
Hey! Hey!
Ooh.
Psst! Chon!
come on. Stop wasting time.
you!
Chon, I found our ticket out of here.
we're on our way.
looks like old Roy came through again.
just like old times, Chon.
check over there!
over to the alley! -That way!
Yeah, just like old times.
will you forget about the gold for a second?
you're gonna have more money than you ever dreamed of when that first zeppelin takes off.
why do I always believe you?
what do you mean?
you're lucky I didn't invest in that ridiculous automobile idea.
Yeah, that's gonna make a lot of money.
what's that?
doghouse. I'm in the doghouse.
Oh, come on, Chon.
look, I'm sorry I lied.
I just didn't want to disappoint you.
that's exactly what I mean.
I can't take that look.
I learned it from my father.
that's how he used to look at me.
what did your dad do? Was he an lmperial Guard?
no.
much more important.
he was the keeper of the lmperial Seal.
that's what I love about China.
everybody's job description sounds so damn cool.
the seal has been symbol of the emperor's power since Genghis Khan.
it has been passed down from one emperor to another.
my family have been watching over it for 12 generations.
12 generations?
my father and I used to skip stones across the moat and talk about a day I would follow his footsteps.
I was his only son.
if I'd have been there, I could have protected him.
it's not your fault. You were 3, 000 miles away.
what's with that little box?
my sister sent it to me from my father.
there's a message inside. -What's it say?
it's a puzzle box. I don't know how to open yet.
what do you mean?
get a hammer and smash it open so you can see what it says.
I must have patience.
by the time I'm able to open it...
I will be ready to read the message.
come on, Confucius.
that's the corniest thing I've ever heard.
let me see this.
you know what?
we're gonna go to England.
we're gonna find your dad's killer.
we're gonna get that seal back.
there's no reward for this, Roy.
who said anything about a reward?
I'm talking about friendship, loyalty, honor.
okay?
thank you, Roy.
and I hear England is ass soup.
a lot of pretty girls there.
first order of business, my Lords，is a report from our esteemed friend Lord Rathbone...
who recently returned from a diplomatic mission to China.
fellow Lords...
I'm afraid I bring disturbing news from the Orient.
the opium wars have ravaged the land.
the emperor's enemies are organizing.
the most vicious are the Boxers.
a godless band of rebels who murder without discretion.
china is not well.
I have brought back an envoy who should give us some insight into the inscrutable mind of the Chinese.
is he mad?
given to Her Majesty Queen Victoria by the emperor in recognition of her 50 glorious years on the throne.
Outrageousness!
long live the queen.
boy: Jack the Ripper strikes again!
Extra! Extra! Read all about it.
howdy, partner.
the English are not very friendly.
they're just sore losers.
what did they lose?
a little thing called the American Revolution, Chon.
never heard of it.
I'll give you the highlights.
they came over with about a million men.
we had a bunch of farmers with pitchforks and beat 'em like a drum.
Hey! I'm walking here!
you're driving on the wrong side of the road!
bunch of amateurs. These people don't get it.
Hello, ladies.
look at you.
what? I'm not supposed to notice a pretty lady?
I thought you wanted to settle down and have a family.
I do, Chon. I just hope I can.
why not?
sometimes I worry that all the damn horseback riding I did out in the West, bouncing up and down on the hard saddles might have made it so my salmon don't swim upstream the way they're supposed to.
what?
I might be shooting blanks.
Oh.
don't say anything.
Roy, it's okay.
some people are not meant to have a family.
I've always had such a special connection with children.
Hey, watch it, you little punk!
pardon me, guv.
you gents lost your way?
Yeah. We're looking for my sister.
she's staying at 32 Oxford Street.
I know it well, guv. Me old man used to live there.
can you show us the way?
well, memory's a little dodgy.
but I'm sure for a bob I could get you there.
what do you take us for? Okies from Muskogee?
go sell your bullshit someplace else.
we're not buying.
thanks for the tip, guv.
Hey! I stole that watch from my uncle!
what?
this way.
come here, you little rubbish eater!
what did I tell you about poaching on our turf, Charlie?
I'm on the straight and narrow. Honest.
what's this, then?
after I'm through beating you...
you're gonna wish you never ran away from the workhouse!
leave the boy alone.
bloody tourists! Get your noses out of it!
do whatever you want to the kid...
but that's my watch.
well, there's a load of us and only two of you.
so piss off!
easy, fellas. You've lost one war this way.
don't make the same mistake twice.
come on! After him!
Hey!
there he is! Get him!
we've got him now. Move in, lads.
boys, boys, wait, wait!
come on! Get him!
up the bloody ladder!
Hey! Hey!
Oh! Watch it!
Hey.
Ah!
come here, you!
cool.
move it!
you!
did you see that?
it's okay.
okay?!
I call that one my kung pao chicken.
I clotheslined the sucker.
come on, get back!
make way!
I think you gentlemen should accompany me back to the yard.
this isn't a yard! It's a jail!
Roy, calm down.
unbelievable.
wait! Someone's coming!
let me handle this. -I'm gonna handle it.
the English aren't like you.
they don't get all emotional. Touchy-feely.
do me a favor.
park the Kung Fu. Let me do the talking.
come here. Let me give you a hug.
Ooh! [ Laughs ]
I've been after that Fleet Street gang for two years.
then you two come along and bring them down in a single afternoon. Brilliant!
now, um...
Oh, that's my watch!
Yes. A street urchin turned it in.
the little punk better not have scuffed it.
I hope your luck picks up. -What do you mean?
I deduced from your watch that you'd hit a rough patch.
he has. How do you know?
it's an investigative technique I've developed.
I can deduce intimate details about an individual through a close scrutiny of their personal effects.
what else can you tell?
the owner of this watch is a bad gambler and a lousy shot.
although he's cheated death several times...
he spends most of his life wandering in a rather pathetic and futile search for purpose and respect.
Oh, yes.
he has a penchant for loose women.
Wow. That's amazing.
I'm sure it's a very popular party trick at birthdays for small children...
but it doesn't quite play with adults.
just to set the record straight.
Roy O'Bannon is not attracted to loose women.
loose women are attracted to me.
you're Roy O'Bannon? -Yeah.
the famous Western folk hero?
have you heard of me?
have I heard of you?
I've only read "Roy O'Bannon vs. The Mummy" five times.
it's fascinating.
I want you to meet the Shanghai Kid.
Oh, yes.
the faithful Chinese sidekick.
I'm not a sidekick. Those stories are all lies.
come on, don't be bitter.
I can't help what Sage McCallister writes.
if there's anything I can do, I'm at your service.
we're looking for my sister. She's staying at this address.
can you take us there?
Oh, dear.
I think you'd better come with me.
if you don't mind, I'll just wait outside.
[ clears throat ] lntroduce me.
Oh. This is Lin, my baby sister.
Roy O'Bannon.
pleasure.
you never told me your sister was such a...
beautiful lotus blossom.
What'd she say?
no, no, no.
no talking about me in your native tongue.
why are you in jail?
I followed the man who murdered Father.
And?
I found out where he live.
I snuck inside his house and tried to kill him.
it's my duty to find Father's killer.
no, it is mine! I'm the one who promised Father.
but I'm his only son.
when you abandoned us for America...
father said he had no son.
what?
whoa. Time out.
time out. Come here.
the detective's a fan.
why don't I play the celebrity card?
we'll get her out that way.
okay? -Okay.
don't worry. I'll get you out.
everything's gonna be okay.
in fact, I'm gonna give you my good-luck playing cards.
just ignore the naked ladies.
have you opened Father's box?
not yet.
she tried to assassinate Lord Rathbone whilst he was taking afternoon tea.
he's 10th in line to the throne...
her Majesty's favorite cousin...
and the finest swordsman in England.
so, of course, the press had a field day.
the story actually knocked Jack the Ripper off the front page.
Artie, Lin is not a killer.
she's just a really, really, really hot...
confused Chinese girl.
maybe if I agreed to sign a few autographs and talk to some of my fans here in England...
do some type of charity event, can we get her out that way?
I'm afraid that's out of the question.
what will happen to my sister?
she'll go to trial, probably be locked away in an institution for the criminally insane.
the tabloids have already dubbed her "Loony Lin " .
I thought it was rather catchy.
at the time.
do you have any notion what would happen if we were to be seen together?
since your return, I have yet to lay eyes on the lmperial Seal.
I'm hosting a jubilee ball at my country estate tomorrow.
be at the stables at midnight.
as requested, a token of my esteem.
this is where you get out.
I hope there will be more trust between us when I'm emperor and you are the new king.
Wow. Buckingham Palace. Look at that, Chon.
that's where the queen lives.
Hey, look at this guy.
he's a royal guard. He has a very important job.
I used to be just like him.
no, they're nothing like you.
they're a tourist attraction.
you can make faces at them, insult them...
and they can't move a muscle.
here. Watch this. -Roy...
no, it's okay.
Hey, buddy, your shoes are untied.
that is the biggest damn beaver I have ever seen.
Roy, stop it.
the queen!
look! The queen!
she's mooning us!
he almost went for that.
my friend and I just came over from America.
you might have heard of it. We run your jerkwater country.
come on, you gonna take that from a colonial?
Roy, stop it.
I bet you are one hell of a damn poker player.
no hard feelings.
huh?
they can't do that!
you're not allowed to do that!
shouldn't have touched him.
you scram, you little punk.
I've got friends at Scotland Yard.
I'll give you up in a heartbeat.
you get your watch back?
don't worry about my watch. Go on.
it's a knockoff.
what are you talking about?
my uncle stole this watch from President Lincoln.
it's a priceless family heirloom.
not according to the pawnbroker.
you should not steal.
if I don't steal, I don't eat.
who showed you how to do all that kicking and punching?
my father.
have you ever heard of those? They're parents.
you don't 'cause you're a little orphan.
now, go on. You're cramping our style.
Oh, this country blows.
you need a place to stay?
come on in and warm your dogs.
[ whistles ] You can get into a lot of trouble breaking into a place like this.
that being said, well done.
you just ate the last chocolate.
course I did.
you gotta look out for number one.
I could really get used to this.
living the life of a country gentleman.
maybe doing a little painting.
let Lin play in the garden with the children.
Vera, Chuck, and Dave.
who's Lin?
lin's the most beautiful woman I've ever met.
she's gonna be the savior of the house of O'Bannon.
Chon, check out the threads.
all I'm missing is the loyal hound curled at my feet.
we are wasting time. We must find Rathbone.
what do you think I've been doing?
sitting here drinking expensive hooch?
refill.
I've been working on a plan.
now -- Whoa. Don't slosh the brandy.
lt messes with the bouquet. -Sod off.
I'm trying to teach you a skill set.
help get you off the street.
bartenders make big bucks. -Roy!
the plan.
thank you, Chon.
if we find the seal...
we can prove Rathbone killed your dad.
it's the old Hail Mary play.
I also have a version where we dig a tunnel.
Hey!
bloody catapult. Jesus Christ!
you don't need a catapult! -Who asked you?
you don't interrupt grown-ups when they're talking.
lord Nelson Rathbone requests the pleasure of your company at the jubilee ball in honor of Her Majesty's 50th year on the throne.
sounds good.
it doesn't address security.
they're not gonna let Chon and l waltz into the castle.
all you need is a proper disguise.
I do like a good disguise.
I look like a fool.
What?! You're a maharaja. That's lndian royalty.
but I'm Chinese. -It's the same thing.
Bob your head a little bit.
gives you more of a lndia-royalty flavor.
that's good. Good show, good show.
good show, good show.
cheerio, cheerio. -Cheerio, cheerio.
what do we do when we see Rathbone?
kill him.
no, okay? No!
you're gonna be civil, cause we don't have the seal.
no seal. No Lin. No family honor. Okay?
be cool. Okay, we look great.
let's enjoy this party.
whoa. What are you doing? -I'm going inside.
the place is haunted. -You're the harness man.
you get back at the carriage.
you wait in case we need to make a quick getaway.
go on. Man your post.
you don't always get what you want.
why are you so mean to that boy?
I see a lot of myself in that kid.
it's kind of freaking me out. Come on.
your name, please, sir.
so I can announce you.
Sherlock...Holmes.
which province do you represent, Your Highness?
may I present Major General Sherlock Holmes and His Highness, the maharaja of Nevada.
how are the security arrangements?
Oh, everything seems to be going swimmingly, my Lord.
and if I may say so...
it is an honor to guard Your Lordship tonight.
I speak for all of us at Scotland Yard when I say that no matter how far you are from the throne...
you'll always be number one in our hearts.
okay, here's the plan.
we're gonna get a little chow.
then we're gonna sneak out of here.
start looking for that seal. -Okay.
spotted Dick, sir? -What?
spotted Dick.
can you believe this guy?
I'm trying to get something to eat.
he's asking me if I got the clap.
I think he's offering you food.
Oh. Spotted Dick.
Oh, no. I think I'll pass.
I'm not really a dessert man.
perhaps my friend might like some Spotted Dick.
I might try one of these sausages.
a little smoky Joe.
Mmm! This is good!
I thought the food here was supposed to suck.
the haggis is fresh from Scotland, sir.
it's made from the finest sheeps' bladders.
I'm gonna get some whiskey and wash my mouth out.
you should try the quail.
I shot them myself this morning.
how do you do, Your Lordship?
very well, thank you.
I'm not acquainted with the Nevada province.
but I haven't been to lndia since 81.
I spent most of my time in the Orient.
I hear you've just returned from China.
you are well-informed, Maharaja.
it is my dream that the Chinese people will follow lndia's example and one day embrace British rule.
the Chinese are very proud.
they place family and honor above all else.
well, I'm sure we can break them of that.
if you'll excuse me, I have a matter to attend to.
until we meet again.
patience. I'm proud of you, Chon.
we must find the seal.
what do you see?
shh, shh, shh!
he just pulled a fancy dragon key out of his desk.
that was my father's!
I must avenge his honor.
Hey, slow down, tiger. Slow down.
quit going all Chinese on me.
where is he?
damn it. Remember your puzzle box. Patience.
okay, there are no windows.
we just came in through the only doorway.
that leaves one explanation.
remember in "Roy O'Bannon vs. The Mummy
how the zombie king got away when I chased him into the pharaoh's tomb?
there's a secret passageway behind the sphinx.
there's gotta be a lever or a button over here.
help me lift some stuff up.
the painting. It's looking at me.
look! -Oh, yeah.
looks like it's looking at me. That's great.
no, real eyes. Moving!
that kid got to you, didn't he?
unbelievable! We're not in a haunted house.
that's a technique that an artist uses.
'Ubiquitous gaze" or "pursuant eyes" is the technical term.
it's unnerving, though. I'll give you that.
Roy. Now, those eyes. Look!
whatever you say, Chon.
let's see what you got here, Rathbone.
what, Chon? Are the statues moving now?
Wow.
Mm-mmm!
I can't hear myself think with you shouting at me.
this is ridiculous.
if you want to act like a child and play games...
then find someone else...
cause I take this stuff seriously.
I'm here to work. I'm on a mission.
okay, Chon.
okay, you little Chinese otter.
let's play.
ha!
Chon, demons!
she's gonna fight my battles for me.
come on. Let's go.
what? What are you doing?
it's kinky. I like it.
Wow! Look at this.
wait. There's something different about this room.
Eric: Once upon a time, in deep winter, a queen was admiring the falling snow when she saw a rose blooming in defiance of the cold.
reaching for it, she pricked her finger and three drops of blood fell.
and because the red seemed so alive against the white she thought, "If only I had a child as white as snow, "lips as red as blood hair as black as a raven's wings "and all with the strength of that rose.
soon after, a daughter was born to the Queen and was named, "Snow White.
and she was adored throughout the kingdom as much for her defiant spirit as for her beauty.
we found it in the woods.
it's injured, Mother.
it must have broken its wing.
don't worry, it will heal in time.
I'll look after it.
you possess a rare beauty, my love.
in here.
never lose it.
it will serve you well when you become queen.
snow WHITE: Be careful you don't fall.
I'm just getting you an apple.
here you go. Thank you.
William!
William!
Eric: The next winter was the harshest in memory and Snow White's mother passed away.
the King was inconsolable.
taking advantage of his grief, a dark and mysterious army appeared and lured him into battle.
what devil spawned this army?
send them back to hell!
no prisoners!
Eric: The dark army was defeated, but what would soon come to pass was far darker.
sire!
a prisoner.
MAGNUS: Fear not, you will come to no harm from me or my men.
what is your name, my lady?
Ravenna, sire.
Eric: So enchanted by her beauty was the King that he forgot, for the first time, his broken heart and the very next day, she would become his wife.
you're so beautiful.
that's kind, Child.
especially when it is said that yours is the face of true beauty in this kingdom.
come.
this all must be difficult for you.
I, too, lost my mother when I was a young girl.
I can never take your mother's place.
never
but I feel that you and I are bound.
I feel it there.
your heart.
you will be the ruin of me.
indeed, my lord.
I was ruined by a king like you once.
I replaced his queen, an old woman.
and, in time, I, too, would have been replaced.
men use women.
they ruin us and when they are finished with us they toss us to the dogs like scraps.
what have you given me?
when a woman stays young and beautiful forever, the world is hers.
first, I will take your life, my lord.
and then I'll take your throne.
welcome, brother.
my queen.
Eric: She had tricked her way into the kingdom with a phantom army.
she now welcomed a very real one.
William!
snow, get out! Snow!
I can't leave!
the Princess! No!
get out of here! Go!
William! Don't leave me!
father, we must go back! We must!
No! We've lost her!
No! No! No!
don't leave me! William!
out.
out!
mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?
it is you, my queen.
yet another kingdom falls to your glory.
is there no end to your power and beauty?
the remnants, my queen. What do we do with them?
to the sword.
Finn.
lock her up.
one never knows when royal blood may be of value.
Eric: So poisonous was the reign of Ravenna, that nature turned on itself and people turned on each other.
the land died and with if, hope
and all that time, she kept Snow White imprisoned high up in the north tower.
our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven,
give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us.
lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.
Hello'?
Hello'?
what is your name? I am Greta.
what happened to you'?
all the girls in our village were taken.
I was trying to reach Duke Hammond's castle when I was caught.
Duke Hammond?
is he alive'?
does he still fight in my father's name?
you're the King's daughter.
the night the King died, we were told all in the castle were slain.
and William?
is the Duke's son still alive?
I don't know, Princess.
what will they do to me?
do you remember when we were children begging for scraps like those wretches?
Yes, sister.
am I not kinder?
Yes.
these two were captured leading an ambush on one of our supply trains.
your son'?
handsome.
obviously, a debt owed to your mother.
there was a time I would have lost my heart to a face like yours.
and you, no doubt, would have broken it.
lain, no!
you would kill your queen'?
such courage.
such beauty.
but how strong is your heart?
no. My son.
my $On!
leave him.
let him return to the Duke and speak of the generosity of his queen.
out.
out!
magic comes at a lofty price.
and the expense grows.
you look... Old.
tired.
my Dower fades.
I have something for what ails you.
Oh.
snow WHITE: Greta?
Greta?
mirror, mirror on the wall, who is fairest of them all?
my queen, on this day, one has come of age fairer even than you.
she is the reason your powers wane.
who is it'?
snow White.
snow White?
she is my undoing?
I should have killed her when she was a child.
be warned.
her innocence and purity is all that can destroy you.
but she is also your salvation, Queen.
take her heart in your hand and you shall never again need to consume youth.
you shall never again weaken or age.
immortality.
immortality forever.
Finn!
brother, bring me the King's daughter.
did I wake you?
are you always awake when I watch you'?
you've never come in before.
my sister won't allow it.
she wants you all to herself.
I'm afraid of her.
and not of me?
no.
fear not, Princess.
you will never again be locked in this cell.
what does she want from me'?
your beating heart.
get me out of here!
No!
Greta?
go. FINN: Get me out of here!
No! Go.
FINN: No!
stop her!
catch her!
seize her!
get to the gate!
bring her back to me!
how is it that an innocent young girl makes a fool of my brother?
armed only with a nail.
if she'd had a sword, she would have taken my kingdom.
bring me the King's daughter,
and you let her slip right through your tiny little fingers.
How'?
you swore that you would protect me!
you swore!
now there's no one I can trust.
no one. There's no loyalty, no loyalty.
none, not even from you!
where is she?
she was chased into the Dark Forest, where the men lost her.
she's no good to me in the Dark Forest, lost!
I need her heart! You failed me, Finn!
have I not given all to you!
havel not given you all?
Yes, sister.
quiet.
I have no powers in the Dark Forest.
you have to find me someone.
someone who knows it.
someone who can hunt her.
you owe me money from my pocket and money for the girl.
well, you know, I seem to have drunk it all, but you're welcome to it when it comes out again.
you've gone too far. I want my money!
here it is!
the Queen demands your presence.
can't you see I'm having a bath?
trust me on this, sister.
all right! All right!
Hey!
my brother tells me you are a widower. A drunkard.
and one of few who has ventured into the Dark Forest.
Aye.
one of my prisoners has escaped there.
then he's dead. She.
she is certainly dead.
find her.
bring her to me.
no, I've been to that forest. I'm not going back.
you will be rewarded handsomely.
what good is gold to me if I'm lying dead with the crows picking at my eyes?
why is she of such value?
that is none of your concern.
I'll determine what concerns me, thank you.
you will do this for me, huntsman!
and if I refuse?
do me the favor, I beg of you.
to his knees.
so you wish to be reunited with your beloved?
you do not speak of my wife.
you miss her.
what would you give to see her again?
you know of my powers.
bring me the girl and I will bring back your wife.
nothing can bring her back.
I can.
a life for a life.
she can't have gone far.
all right, do exactly as I do.
it's a bad idea.
stay here.
come here' No!
will you help me?
please, the Queen is going to kill me.
sure she is.
she's going to rip out my heart.
quick work.
Hey.
well done, huntsman.
hand her over.
what do you intend to do with her?
why do you care'?
you want her... Hey!
give me what I was promised.
you did your job well.
now, keep your word.
he'll kill us both. Shut up.
he will. I said, shut up.
no, no.
I'll keep my word when the Queen keeps hers.
Where's my wife?
he's going to betray you.
my sister has many powers.
she can take life away, or sustain it, but she can't bring your wife back from the dead, you fool!
I want her back!
I will find you!
quiet. All right?
Hey, what the hell's going on'?
who are you? Why does the Queen want you dead?
she wants everyone dead, all of us.
what makes you so damn valuable?
you should know, you're the one hunting me.
forget it.
I should have never got involved in the Queen's business.
what did I get in? Stupid...
where are you going'?
getting away from you. You're trouble, is what you are.
I need to get to the Duke's castle. There's an army there.
Oh, the Duke's army?
bunch of farmers and milkmaids with pitchforks.
I know sheep that have more fight in them.
I'm valuable.
that's why you're here, isn't it?
if you return without me, you're dead.
if you leave me, I'm dead.
just for argument's sake, how much reward?
however much is enough.
at least thirty gold pieces... A hundred.
help me.
who are you?
maybe you should have asked the Queen that.
I don't trust you.
I've given you my word. I still don't trust you.
but you have a deal.
give me that, before you lose a finger.
she killed my brave lain with just the palm of her hand and then she drew a dagger from her side with no blood.
she cannot be killed.
but there is more.
the Princess is alive.
where is my son'?
we have word of the Princess.
Ravenna has kept her, all these years.
she lives?
she escaped the castle, into the Dark Forest.
I'm going after her.
hammond: We don't know if she survived.
William!
what?
you ventured beyond the castle walls again, disobeying my orders.
we're all that's left, don't you understand?
I cannot afford to lose any more of my men.
I'm going alone.
I will not lose my only son.
you don't know the Dark Forest.
then I'll find somebody who does.
I will not abandon her a second time.
the forest gains its strength from your weakness.
do you drink to drown your sorrows?
or your conscience?
what concern is it of yours, why I drink?
I suppose a man's sorrows are his own.
what does a young girl like you know about sorrow?
don't flatter yourself.
now stay close.
you men know the dark forest?
load and prepare.
you ride for 50 gold pieces.
does it not trouble you to serve her'?
who the Queen?
I serve no one.
especially that old hag, and any other royalty. They're all damned.
the King and his true queen are not damned.
the King?
he's the one that let the devil in the door.
it's his fault the kingdom's plunged into darkness.
from you?
you know nothing.
what? And you do?
what's a wee scrod like you care about the King anyway?
you're barely old enough to remember him.
the land is diseased.
nature is upturned.
this, this is the legacy of your precious king.
do you need a bowman?
I have a bowman.
kill him.
I said, do you need a bowman?
here, I want to show you something.
which is your lead foot?
if someone comes at you, you raise this arm up and you block, and use their strength against them.
you're small, so wait until they're close and you drive it through their heart to the hilt.
you understand'? Do not hesitate.
you look in their eyes and do not pull it out until you see their soul.
I couldn't do that.
well, you might not have a choice.
we have their trail.
move on. Move on!
wait.
is this the edge of the Dark Forest?
Aye.
what is it?
troll!
go!
run!
I told you to run.
if I had, you would be dead.
only demons or spirits pass through the Dark Forest. Which are you?
we're fugitives from the Queen.
we mean you no harm.
where are all the men?
gone.
have you got nothing to drink?
you have traveled far and carried a great burden.
I've had worse jobs.
anyway, she's not that heavy.
you don't know who she is.
what do you mean?
Why? Who is she?
maybe it needs a skirt, or a dress or something?
that's nice.
how about a face?
your mother wants to see you.
why didn't you tell me?
because I'd think it was too difficult a task?
you would be right.
I didn't trust you.
I'm sorry. Yeah.
our scars protect us.
without beauty, we are worthless to the Queen.
it's a sacrifice we made so we could raise our children in peace while their fathers are at war.
and you, your sacrifice will come.
you must rest.
how can you desert her when you know the truth?
aye, I know the truth.
that's why she should be as far away from me as possible.
anything I ever cared about was taken away from me.
not this time.
she's safer here with you.
Lily! Lily, come On!
come on!
run, rats, run!
find her!
find her!
come on!
get in the boats! Get in the boats!
Lily!
in there, baby. There you go.
come on!
No! No!
come on! Let's go!
No! We have to help them!
you will. Go'
come on! Go!
your beauty is all that can save you, Ravenna.
this spell will make your beauty your power and protection.
by fairest blood it is done.
here. Drink, drink!
but, be warned.
by fairest blood, this spell can be undone.
avenge us!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. You're not.
I am. You left us.
we should never have been there.
Hey, look at me.
I'll take you to Duke Hammond's, okay?
all right'?
you have my word.
wait!
this is our lucky day.
Oh, no. Dwarves.
the hedge-pig I loathe most in the world lands right in our lap.
Eric: Come on, Beith.
is this how you treat a friend?
Oh! No, no, no, you puttock.
this is how I treat a friend.
she's pretty.
BEITH: And who's this?
is this an errant apprentice or captive?
this man is helping me.
we should kill them both.
he's caused us nothing but trouble.
skewer him and leave her to rot. I don't like killing girls.
I do. Good.
leave her alone, Duir.
he's got nothing. One silver coin and an empty codpiece.
two days we sat here. What for?
nothing.
we should have stayed by the river. What a waste of time!
cut us down, Beith. I have gold I can pay you.
it's not here, it's hidden back in the woods.
shut your ugly mug, huntsman.
if you had any pennies, you would have pissed it away on mead by now.
cut us down, then I'll show you.
pull the other one, you lying dangler.
tell them the truth, huntsman. There's no time!
I have to take this girl to Hammond's. She's not safe here.
well, my little heart bleeds for you.
we should chop them up and feed them to the wolves.
all: Yeah. Yes!
who is she?
she's worth a lot of gold to me.
which I am happy to share with you stupid little dwarves.
stop that!
gold is worth nothing to any of you if you're all dead!
the Queen's men hunt us!
they're very close! Shut up!
you have love for the Queen?
we have no love for the Queen.
then you fight against her?
no one fights against the Queen.
we lost everything when the King died.
we fight only for ourselves!
Yes.
my father was King Magnus.
BEITH: Muir, does she speak the truth?
Yes. She is of the blood.
she is destined, Beith.
I see an end to the darkness.
DUIR: Riders!
they found us!
if you don't cut us down, we'll all be killed!
I don't like this, Beith. It smells like trouble.
you'll find your weight in gold if you out us down, now!
shut up, Princess.
queen's riders!
and they're coming this way!
we'll take her, but not him!
what?
no, both of us!
cut them both down, Gort!
let's get the hell out of here!
move it! Move it!
they're close.
blasted fairy music.
GORT: Yeah.
good thing there's plenty of moss about.
where are we?
they call it Sanctuary, my lady.
it's the home of the fairies.
fairies.
clear!
Coll'?
clear!
BEITH: Set up camp!
Gus. Quert. Make the fire.
Gort, your mug.
play louder, you whey-face,
I can still hear them harpy fairies.
Duir, would you really have killed her?
Yeah.
of course.
that seat's not taken, if that's what you were about to ask.
I want to thank you.
it's only a log.
there's no need to thank me.
no, for before.
for defending me.
Ah. Your father was a good man.
the kingdom prospered.
our people prospered.
there were more of you.
Aye. GORT: Yeah.
the men you see before you and many, many more, went deep into the caves.
we were noble gold miners because we could see the light in the darkness.
Gus. Gus?
you were just a boy, but you remember.
when we returned to the surface,
Jung Jae-young. Love is talking a walk itogether at dawn
lee Na-young
lee Na-young. Anyone who has held hands
lee Na-young, while walking a wooded path will know that love is the greatest thing in the world
it's a forkball
Oh, sorry
try to stay healthy
I may not come to your games anymore
so don't push yourself too hard
Oh, sure
let's break up
please
let's end it now
hey
get lost
just get out of my sight
hey
you said you love me?
what a load of crap
why the hell did you call me out here, anyway?
you can do it over the phone, huh?
you want anything else?
Oh, you bought me this now you want it back?
who the hell wears corduroy now anyway?
shit, you women are all the same!
shit!
what are you waiting for?
you want me to chase you off?
fuck off!
shit, just leave!
okay...
I suppose it's for the best
bye
it wasn't love this time either
I always think that it is
but sooner or later I find out it's not
I haven't experienced love yet
not even first love
these tedious nosebleeds always come when I'm alone
it's 2 o'clock
time to go to the doctor's
my head's photo is in black and white
it's the heart I'm worried about
Oh, so that's the heart
no, those are the lungs
the heart's here
this shouldn't be like this
that's black and white too
it's all black and white
from here it looks like I'm pigeon-chested
that's not the problem
there are two kinds of tumors
malignant ones and gentle ones
but Mr. DONG your tumor is malignant
look here
this here's like that
it shouldn't be like that
if this turns out like that it'll be dangerous
and as you see it's already like that
look at this It's already moved up here
how did that happen?
it's moving all over
it shouldn't be doing that
what do we do?
yes?
Oh, it's me
it's September now
I've three months if I'm lucky so I won't see next year
my head is strange
it's black and white and malignant to boot
I'll go have a drink
it's usually like that
people who suddenly
Iose next year go drinking
Hey, it's our outfielder
why are you alone today?
I've always come alone
is that so?
hello
is your shoulder okay? Don't play outfield
you should pitch Pitching is cool
you were so famous in high school DONG Chi-sung, pitcher!
throwing from the right hitting from the left, huh?
a 6-time Phoenix Cup winner with MVP and Pitching awards...
the air's no good here
you could catch a disease from this air
lung cancer, malignant...
you're awake
can you see?
the bartender
why am I here?
can't even hold your liquor
you brought me here?
you think I followed you?
I'm heavy, how did you get me here?
I folded you and put you in a box. Why?
you don't even remember
why'd you drink so much if you can't hold liquor
but for a sleeping drunk guy you look really sweet
you don't snore or flail around
you have no bad mannerisms I'd never have guessed it
I'll go now
I paid for the room pay me back later
the wind...
I discovered three things today that other people have and I don't
I have no first love
I have no next year
I have no bad mannerisms
someone SPEClAL
directed by JANG Jin
Hey, I've never seen that before
it's new, It isn't sweet
it's selling well
I met that guy
right, you said he's a regular customer
yeah
but, this time...
did you talk to him?
yeah
two words?
a bit more than usual
but, we...
Hey, this is great This'll sell well
yesterday that guy and I went to a hotel
we're just about all here
we'll start this month's meeting
the leader of our online group lD "Pink Mask,"
will speak first
here we go!
what the hell's he thinking out there?
let's go!
Hey!
what's with you?
aren't you gonna catch it?
what's the point?
what did that punk say?
have you gone crazy?
yeah I'm crazy, so what?
today's confessional postcard is from a woman in Heukseok-dong with the lD "Writing Princess"
he cried today
the first time I saw it
what could cause such a good-spirited person to cry so?
and he drank yesterday too
and he drank yesterday too
it's the first time I ever saw him drink
and wouldn't you know it...
this person who never drinks...
after not even three shots started shouting about his b&w head and heart and then passed out
first I took him to a hotel
for me to lift and carry a man of his size was not easy
so I had to put him in a box
in the room I just stared at him vacantly
he didn 't snore or move around
I don 't know if he could tell I was there
there was so much I wanted to say and so much I wanted to hear
but with the words all stuck in my throat all I could say was
you have no bad mannerisms
that was it
he seemed somewhat annoyed at my comment
waking up to a strange woman talking about him that way
he seemed offended
why does nothing come out the way I wish?
his sad face keeps coming to my mind
is there any way I can make him feel better?
he said he lost his phone...
what's your problem?
why are you doing this?
are you playing with me?
I think this story deserves a mobile phone, huh?
that's right but what do you think?
is this love?
it could be one-sided love or it may just be compassion
seems like compassion to me
anyway, Miss Writing Princess we 'll send you a mobile phone
we hope that next time you can cheer him up and speak better
I wanted to give you that present
the mobile phone from the station
you don't have one
here's the hotel fee
is that right?
that's $5 too much - What do you think I am?
keep it
you need shampoo?
I heard the news About you and your girlfriend
I know how you feel
still, not catching the ball won't change anything
you think that'll get you points?
I got a call from the majors
from tomorrow you'll start pitching again
last chance
just forget everything and take the mound
forget your mistake that day It wasn't your fault
of course it will be hard but just forget that day
the most dramatic moments in baseball occur in the 9th inning
and 9 times out of 10
it's due to the winning team
dramatic moments come in two varieties
the first is when someone excels like crazy, the second is when some crazy fool screws up
strike!
on that day we had a moment of the second type thanks to me
nice pitch!
let's wrap this up!
in that wild and deafening stadium
I still can't understand how
I was able to hear her voice
you damned moron!
if we break up like this you'll go meet someone new
how long will it last?
a week? A month?
and you'll meet someone else again
but then you'll discover again it wasn't love
that's the way you are!
your love is too weak Just die!
if you say you love me then you can die with me
if we die that way, then the love we wanted will come true
don't let go of love you fool!
that most dramatic moment in baseball was of my making
for the first time, I was on the sports papers' front page
a Strange Celebration
he's really going to make him a starter
manager Heo must be crazy
Yeah, but you never saw him in college
I heard he was a big deal back then
but this is different this is the pro league
I heard he broke his shoulder too
I met him once in a fall preseason game
I'd never seen a pitch like that
I couldn't even swing
did he throw that fast?
I'd never seen a pitch so scary in all my life
take your base!
I had no time to duck
then the way you keep forgetting names and phone numbers...
...that's when it started?
that wasn't all of it
I found out later
the girl he dated back then was a fan of mine
so he beaned you on purpose?
crazy fool
cool though, isn't it?
we throw the ball to get an out
Chi-sung threw it for love
how hard were you throwing just now?
at about 80%
just think of it as throwing for practice
maybe next year you can start again as a pitcher
by next year...
it'll be a new season
excuse me
Yes, how can I help you?
I came to get some money...
excuse me?
I mean, a loan or something...
club members, prepare yourself
you brought your stamp and lD card?
a house mortgage for $100, 000?
yes
on the floor!
get down!
what the hell's with you? On the floor!
this freak's got a death wish!
get down!
I...
don't have a death wish...
you think that's why I'm doing this?
I want to live too!
look, you guys
you... one, two three, four...
why are there so damned many? You nine guys!
are you a baseball team?
you guys are doing this in order to live well
but I'm getting a loan 'cause I'm gonna die
you guys are waving guns around 'cause you wanna live
what about me?
I have no choice but to die!
so I'm mortgaging my home so what?
you!
do you know what love is?
but why did you do it in such a big group?
we heard that once 8 people had done it
we thought we'd try to set a new record
you talked a lot with the man who came for a loan?
we were just listening
first he started talking about the loan
then what did he start yelling about?
something in black and white?
then what? He started going on about love
from then on it was mostly talk about love
then I said what's so great about love?
you meet a woman ask her name
once you know her name you start loving her
then you ask her age and her favorite food...
how did you...?
it's a mobile phone
the one I got from the station
it takes pictures and the color's nice
I've got money too
I never asked you for this
and why are you following me?
I didn't follow you - Then how'd you find...?
you asked the real estate broker!
damn guy, always telling people where I live
why don't you remember me?
my home is just 39 steps from here
it used to be over 60
but now it's just 39
I'm not following you
you told me yourself and even pointed it out
my mom asked me to give you this
Oh, you just moved in?
where is your new home?
around that corner the second house on the right
tell your mom we'll bring the plate back after we finish
goodbye
you're really amazing opening this place
it's just for fun
okay, stop by sometime
sure, I live just over there - Oh really? - Yeah - Okay, see you - I'll come often - Please do - Bye then - Later - Yeah

five stations

five
do things always work out so well for you?
I got a 3rd prize Lotto ticket about three times she's the female lead but she dies in the end
is it still interesting if you know how it ends?
it's too startling if they die all of a sudden
it's just too sad
the male lead can be sad but why are you?
and if you know beforehand will you not be sad?
perhaps so
Oh, I dunno
better not watch it
long time no see
how have you been?
fine
you know my friend?
Oh, sure
hello
it's been a while Chi-sung
I thought you didn't like movies
so you come to the theater after all...
I got a free ticket
who's that? Your girlfriend?
no...
just... someone I know
Really?
anyway, I'm glad you're well I was worried
enjoy the movie
sure - Let's go - Okay
do you "just know" a lot of women?
what?
are there a lot of women you "just know"?
how many?
you're the first
no one else
I'm relieved
what a relief
I feel much better now
the film was about one woman's love
and about an old telephone pole she always stared at
a telephone pole as the hero
what a weird movie
the man she loved lived in the city
he used his fists for cash earning enough to scrape by
he always thought about the woman waiting for him
he resisted the temptations of city women without his love wavering in the slightest
could only happen in a movie
the two loved each other under the pole and parted from each other there
and the old pole witnessed it all
even at dawn as the sun rose
she always waited for him under the pole
when the sun fell and it became night she went home
this tedious movie finally ended in a scene where the man comes back for her
I thought the film was about his undying love but it suddenly turned into an action movie
damned incoherent film
on top of that the woman coughed a few times and collapsed for no reason and the man who couldn't go back also collapsed
in front of him a strange telephone pole appeared
he reached out his hand to the pole
he closed his eyes thinking about her
and then a strange thing happened to the telephone pole
his tremendous yearning for her love entered the electrical wires and began to flow
his love passed through countless poles and wires making its way to her
and finally it reached the old pole where she lay
and our hero the pole passed on the man's love
to sum up, in a word
love rode the electrical wires and reunited our lovers in this unbearably stupid movie
thanks for the movie and for dinner
and the mobile phone too
your parents must be worried, it's late
they passed away both of them
mine too
it was the same day
on that neighborhood club trip they were on the same plane
Hi, Chi-sung? It's Dad
we're taking off now
how can such a big thing like this fly?
amazing, I tell you
have a good trip Dad my game's about to start
Oh, really?
are you in the outfield again today?
when are you going to pitch?
you're not gonna pitch anymore, are you?
ha...
now! We're flying now!
the wheels are off the ground!
what? Now we're going down again?
honey, why are we going down?
we'll go up again later - Wait we're heading for the ground!
we're gonna hit the ground!
Chi-sung, it's the end
Chi-sung, your father loves you!
on the first day he flew he passed away
he took a plane and went to heaven
even at his last moment he told me that he loved me
you're supposed to turn off your phone at take off
how'd he manage that?
he didn't know it was his first time!
goodbye
this trash...
I'll throw it out at home
are you looking after Mr DONG?
yes
I'm looking after him now
a word, please
how long has it been like this?
the two of us, you mean?
no, not that
how long has he been so sick?
Oh...
I'm not sure
why, is he very sick?
it has progressed too far
tastes bitter
have a candy
stand by the wall
move closer
just a minute
that's fine
what's that? This is fun
don't bring me any more medicine
thief! Catch him!
sounds like a thief came
I guess so
good night, then Bye
out of the way! I'll kill you!
I'm not blocking you
Hey!
Hey, what are you doing?
that's my home dammit!
Hey, you son of a bitch!
Hey, doing this at your age?
why can't you just work hard and earn money?
doing this sort of thing at night is hard work
I can't believe you
living is hard for me too
but I'd never live the way you do
Hey, do you know what love is?
I thought of killing myself too
rather than live like this I thought of killing myself
I may be young, but I've a wife and two kids
so I need to live
if I die what happens to them?
my life isn't my own
I have to find some way to get by
go and live, you punk
sir!
I'll heed your words and live well
I'll come visit too
don't come after two months I'll be gone
if you move, call me
I'll repay your kindness
I won't be able to call
live well, don't die
go on
as for me, I don't know much about love
but love... is just love, isn't it?
what kind of love doesn't matter
if you love, then that's love
but I'm just a thief so I don't know much
goodbye
I've nothing to give you so I'll leave you with that, sir
what are you doing, miss?
what's everyone doing here?
do you know this house's owner?
Why?
what's your relation with DONG Chi-sung?
I'm just...
a woman he knows
what? Then I'm a detective he doesn't know
we've found the stolen item
and also some bundles of cash
what? Is it stolen?
well, it seems it might be
for a guy whose shoulder still isn't 100%
how can he throw that fast?
just try hitting that lt'll kill you
don't embarrass me here just give me something gentle
what is it?
why didn't you tell me?
why did you do it you're a nice man
you're not that smart or good-looking, but you're nice
look, what are you talking about?
how did you end up here?
I asked directions
that's not what I mean
I meant, why are you here?
let's talk at home
you can't go home!
you can't. They'll catch you if you do
so you don't know how to contact the thief?
what's the point?
we're being accused of robbery!
we can't turn him in he's got a loving wife and kids
let's just go to the police and explain everything
why do you keep saying"we"?
go to the station and explain it Why run away?
I don't have time
going to the station and explaining it all and being dragged from here to there
I don't have time for that
are you so busy?
you don't seem so busy to me
could I stay at your home a few days?
Nah, it'll just be a nuisance
no, it's not that... I'm fine...
I worry you might be uncomfortable...
whatever you want
this room's for sleeping?
you mean the two of us?
no, I asked if you sleep here
you got a language problem...
I sleep here on the floor
I used to use the bed but I kept falling off and hurting myself...
you want to wash up?
I'll go out and buy something
see how things are doing outside
is stealing such a huge crime?
the place is swarming with cops
you cook well
try some of this, too
damn, that's salty
the game's on...
you don't know baseball at all?
if you get to there it's one point?
you go to 2nd and 3rd then come back
can you run straight from 1st base to 3rd?
no, they'll yell at you
that guy's got much better
is he good?
no
that's not so hard
if you catch that hit ball...
the fielder? - Yes
if the fielder catches it...
a ground ball?
Yes, if you catch a ground ball and chuck it into the crowd what happens?
not to first base? - Yeah if you just chuck it into the crowd
Chuck it...
you can't do that
but, why would you throw it there?
just for fun Can't you?
you can't
you don't know anything
I'd love to see that
that'd be fun
the game's finished
should I change the channel?
what would you do if you had two months to live?
what?
let's say you had only two months more to live, what would you do?
could I die any faster?
what?
do I have to wait out the two months?
could I just get it over with quickly?
it's a pain waiting two months with nothing special to do
you're right
Yes, she's correct
for a person with two months to live the biggest agony is waiting those two months
there isn't much you can do to ease that pain
I haven't written a will
because I have no one to list in it
I know that my heart will never withstand this
not many people commit suicide by marathon
but it's a clever choice
it won't be too painful
I can think things over before I die
today, I'm leaving this earth
the 5th place prize was a kimchi refrigerator
this must be really expensive!
why'd you buy me this?
I don't have any family... Thank you
I don't know if I should accept this...
what should I do?
what do I put in here? Can I only put in kimchi?
hey
are you sleeping?
no, not yet
come here a minute...
sit here and listen
you like this song, right?
a long time ago...
when I was in high school
I often heard it while walking past your window
so I started liking this song too
why did you start liking me?
I forget, it's been so long
do you still like me that much?
you didn't even know I existed
you didn't know who I was where I lived how long and from how close
I could feel your presence
what I liked...
or what I disliked
I'm sorry
for living without knowing
I'm sorry
there's a lot I'm doing for the first time
so...
there's a lot I don't know
it's a thief!
Hey, you! - Sir!
would you like some tea, or fruit?
Oh, thank you - Look, you!
what are you doing back so soon?
and in the same neighborhood!
you think this is your workplace?
do you commute back and forth?
actually, that day I met you after receiving your great generosity
I decided to quit this work
then why are you back scaling walls?
life has fenced me in
darling, do you know what love is?
well...
it would be nice to buy a computer hook up the internet and all that
is that all you can say?
don't you know? What love is?
I love you
should I quit this job?
sleep when others sleep work when others work
there's nothing wrong with me
you and the kids... surely we can get by hand to mouth?
honey, l... - You want that too, right?
you don't like staying up worrying about me?
should we try to live honestly? - That's great - but... - I can cook well
I can try getting a job at a restaurant
even with manual labor we can still feed ourselves, right?
honey, l...
I'm pregnant again
I'm so sorry, you can't go home because of me
forget it, just go
don't forget your bag
next time you run away since you can't go there hide at our place
thank you for offering, ma'am
I may be nothing but a petty thief but I still have moral integrity
you suit each other well!
I don't know what brought you together but don't ever part!
you're pigeon-chested
Yes, I've been hearing that since I was young
so that comes out in the photo, too
listen closely
there are two kinds of tumors
malignant ones and the gentler ones
please continue
but this one is malignant
look here
this here's like that
it shouldn't be like that
if it turns out like that it won't be good - Darling! - Look at this it's already moved up here
what with all of you these days?
moving all over the place...
but this...
something's moving all over the place?
have we spoken in this manner before?
what?
you're pigeon-chested right?
Yes, I'm quite famous for that
Hello? Darling It's malignant
I miss you!
we should take action on this quickly
Dong Chi-sung is hiding a disease right now
if the capillary in his nose has grown so weak then he'll experience almost constant nosebleeds
if this continues he could develop serious anaemia
the surgery takes 20 minutes he should do it soon
how did this develop?
there are two possible causes
first, stress and fatigue can bring it on in people with inherently weak nose capillaries
the other possibility is if from early childhood one utilizes a part of one's body to aggressively remove objects in the nose cavity, it can happen
I think it's the first thing you mentioned
at first, that's what everyone wants to believe
will it take much longer?
is it hard to put on?
does it fit?
we can change it, if not
I've never worn anything like this
it's too revealing
I can't wear an undershirt my stomach will be cold
it's time for your medicine
I'll be pitching the day after tomorrow
will you come watch?
actually...
I wasn't going to pitch anymore
I just...
just one last time I thought...
I'd try taking the mound
don't pick your nose
stop, You can't pick your nose anymore
Yes, well...
Mr. DONG Chi-sung?
yes?
I'm a policeman
what?
catch that bastard!
Dong Chi-sung...
a baseball player Outfield
I'm a pitcher
you know this man?
no, I don't
why'd you kill a man you don't know?
we found a handbag in your room
inside that bag was this watch
the watch still works fine
but the watch's owner is dead
the watch has gone dead too
Chi-sung...
the sun has risen
the sun is up but if you keep saying you don't know anything
I'm going to get real angry
I told you everything I know
there's something you don't realize
in this room here you even have to talk about things you don't know
in this room ignorant men become intellectuals blind men talk about things they've seen and deaf men talk about things they've heard, got it?
what if they're deaf and dumb?
damn, the blood pressure!
let's try this again
so on the day of the murder the thief entered your home and you reassured him and sent him home
I don't know if he went home directly
and the thief
Ieft the bag at your home so you gave him $2000 in return
it wasn't some kind of trade, it's just...
he was having a hard time, so...
does that make any sense?
he's got a hard life so you give him $2000?
Hey, my life is hard too!
you think I get rich running around investigating?
I want $2000 too!
well, I can give it to you
go to my home and under the blanket...
Oh, the blood pressure again!
Dong Chi-sung
you're free to go now
but Chief!
we've identified the murderer
it was the victim's girlfriend
but it seems she planned to commit suicide
luckily we found her will
she wrote all the details of the crime in it
we're trying our best to find her
if she's not dead we'll catch her soon
anyway, sorry to have troubled you
that's the way this job is sometimes
try to understand
but why did she do it?
she said she loved him too much
that happens with love sometimes
dying, killing...
Oh, and your doctor asked us to give you this
Chi-sung pitch well today
pitching suits you better than the outfield
chief, do you know that guy?
good afternoon - Yes?
Oh, it's you again - Yeah...
is DONG Chi-sung here?
that baseball player?
he must be at the baseball stadium. Look...
you're out!
it's been quite chilly recently but with the nicer weather a lot of fans came tonight
doosan vs Lotte bottom of the 6th
Dong Chi-sung is still on the mound
gong got selected as one of the players and he's doing a good job up to the middle of the 5th
quite an unexpected performance from DONG
with Doosan losing starters to injury we thought they'd be using a lot of relievers
this is quite unexpected
if DONG takes them past the 7th inning
doosan will have a chance
are you okay?
you're over 1 00 pitches - Let's bring in the next guy - No, l...
I just want...
for as long as I can throw...
I want to throw
and the pitch... A hit
Oh, it's a hard hit ball
it's going way back
it's still going...
it's over the fence!
it's a 2-run home run!
it's 2-0, Doosan is ahead
Dong Chi-sung winds up. It's in play!
it's a single
his third pitch, inside
it's a fly ball
well, I expected KO would close out the game but DONG is still in there
of course it's nice to pitch a complete game but they can 't afford to worry about that now
I've spent a long time asking just what love is
amazingly however curious I was
I never looked up the word in the dictionary
because I knew
I wouldn't believe what it said
but what's obvious is today I'm pitching for someone special - It's in play! - He got it
Dong fielded it on one hop
Dong had a great game today
his second debut in the pros was a big success
doosan wins, 2-0
he's not throwing it
this is the last throw I'll ever make
now the woman I know and everyone else will never forget this image of me
goodbye, everyone
I was really curious
if I fielded a ball and threw it into the crowd what would happen?
yes
did you see it?
you wouldn't believe the look on the manager's face
what if you can never play again?
no big deal if I can't
anyway, come on over I made dinner
I doubt there will be any food at your home so eat here
and the house has been feeling empty lately
if it's cold out you can stay the night too
Hello?
Hello?
let go, dammit!
Hey, where is that quack?
are you hiding? Let go! Don't look at me!
my tumor's moving all over, is it?
what the hell's moving, huh?
let go of me!
where are you?
I mortgaged my house because of you!
I lost my job!
Hello?
who?
Oh, boss!
he's over there now?
get in, I'm gonna start driving!
all right, all right
come on, you're drunk
you need to get in first!
Hey, gimme that!
Hey, Yi-yeon
stop drinking and let's go
uh, who do we have here?
our Writing Princess
get in, we're about to go
let's go home
home?
I have no home, dammit
I spent all my damn money!
got fired from my job!
what?
you gonna let me stay?
at your house?
Why?
do you love me?
you interested in me?
why do you do this to me?
are you not sure?
why do you talk that way?
do you really not know?
are you asking because you're curious?
damn, tell me if you love me!
I love you
don't worry
he'll come back when he's sober
he can't drink where'd he pick up these bad mannerisms?
I'll be going now - Huh? Sure - His bag... - Huh?
Oh, sure
sorry, I'm sorry
but l...
I don't know anything
I could've just lived two months and then died but why did I have to live?
if I died, I think I could understand everything
it would be a relief
that would be great
I don't know
dammit
does it hurt?
it hit you hard
I'm not sure yet
but have we met before?
you're the woman from the stadium
so you'll really die?
I guess I will
this is what you wanted to love and then die
lucky you
I don't know
why am I so sad?
what?
it's what you wanted
I guess it wasn't
I guess you can only feel it when you're alive
wait a minute wait
what's so great about love?
you meet a woman ask her name
once you know her name you start loving her
then you ask her age her favorite food...
love is just... waiting
you can go to it
love is waiting for you, go!
whether it's ball four or you're hit by a pitch...
I don't know much about love
but love... is just love, isn't it?
what kind of love doesn't matter
if you love...
she said she loved him too much
that happens with love sometimes
dying, killing...
I hear you breathing
your breathing...
so you're alive
I just want to stay here for as long as you are alive...
is that okay?
I...
I want to ask you something
what's your name?
Yi-yeon
han Yi-yeon
that's pretty
thank you
so...
shall l...
escort you home?
my bag...
how old?
Oh, twenty-four
and your favorite food?
cup noodles
Ah, noodles
your hobby?
radio - Right
right, radio The postcards...
your blood type is O?
b
people with B their personality...
nice
I'm type O
today I received three things that other people had and I didn't
I got next year
I got bad mannerisms and I got first love
Oh, really... When did you get measles?
when I was seven - Oh, seven...
your blood type... - I already told you!
just now?
did I say I'm type O? - Yes
God, our heavenly father, who has commanded us to love one another as Thy children.
I could killed them all. I could killed you.
in town, you are the law. Out here, its me.
dont push it.
dont push it or Ill give you a war you wont believe.
- Let it go.
let it go.
he's stuck there. He can't go any place!
if you don't fly this thing, Ray,
I swear to God, I'm gonna kill you.
hold it steady, you son of a bitch!
get that man a cigar!
William. William, your lace.
William, where did you find this? This watch doesn't belong to you.
do you understand?
Jess, stop it. You put it back where you found it, William.
voila. Montez-le. Comme ?
toute droite. Toute droite comme ca, un petit peut plus.
tres bien. Bravo, c'est magnifique.
l'm saying it might be in your interest to listen, and you'd do well to keep your wits about you when l talk about scree.
OK? So, show time.
er, thanks for your help.
erm, we're gonna be watching a documentary now, and you're not allowed to watch television, are you?
right, you got something to be getting on with? OK, good.
right.
that is expensive and not for you to be messing around with, alright?
fire. When treated with care, it can be mans greatest tool.
but, if used incorrectly, it can be his most deadly foe.
- That's it!
what? - You know damn well what!
l don't have a tennis ball!
go on. Fetch.
nice drawings.
Rarrr! - My book!
Oh, sorry. There you go.
don't you want it? l thought you said you wanted it. Hmm?
l thought you said you wanted it! - No!
morning, Janet. A couple of miscreants for the attention of " She Who Must Be " .
lee Carter, sit down. - Yeah.
sit down. - Alright.
he's got St Vitus' Dance, that one, l tell you.
OK, thank you.
what is your name?
listen, mate, l don't mind taking the blame for this if you like.
but, er, if l do, you, er, might have to give me something in return.
fair enough. l always fancied a watch.
you probably don't mind getting a letter sent home and being tortured.
didn't you know? About the torture?
Oh, yeah. The last time she tortured me, l could barely stand up for a week. Pain like you'd never believe.
doctor said they might have to amputate it off.
well, can't keep the lady waiting, can we?
let's just, er, get this over and done with.
l'll pray for you, Lee Carter. - Cheers.
dear God, make sure Lee Carter doesn't get... too badly hurt.
- Now, voici Michelle Gina.
dit bonjour a Marie Planté.
voici monsieur Lucas Dupont.
duncan Miller? - Yep.
voici Monsieur Didier Revol!
bienvenue, Didier.
let me help you, Lee Carter.
God, that bitch was rough. She must have loved that bloody goldfish.
l'll be alright though, in a week. Maybe two. l don't know.
can you... smell that?
that stench is the smell - of Lee Carter. - Up yours, Tina.
scab. - Slapper.
scab. - Er, slapper.
scab. - l blame the parents.
well, that's me, then. l'd better be off.
no, don't worry, l'll be fine.
time heals all wounds. Oh, God!
come on! Damn it!
had to be the one with the bloody trailer on the back, didn't it?
where are you going? - Oh, erm,...
the Head said l could have the afternoon off after her torturing me.
how can you cycle with your leg all bad?
right here? - Yeah, exactly.
ls this where you live? - Yeah, this is my house.
Yeah. Of course it isn't, you idiot. lt's a short cut. Keep pedalling.
Hey, boy, that video you're selling me, it all wonky.
l can't see nothing but fuzzy lights.
l told you about that, Dora. lt's your tracking.
are you alright, Frank?
that's Frank.
so, this is where you live?
Oh, no. This is the family business. My home's through here.
so, this is your home?
Yep, this is it. Home, sweet home.
hold that a second.
what are you doing?
l know what we could do.
lf you don't tell me where they are hiding, then l have no choice but to shoot you and your cat. Do you have any last requests?
l...
skill. Skills on toast.
you know, l've been thinking. The watch is nice, but, well, it only really covers me getting tortured.
l did have to, you know, take the blame and lie.
what do l get for all that?
l don't have another watch.
l don't mean another watch. l get to choose how you pay me back, right?
right. - To properly pay me back, you'll be the stuntman in the film l'm making for Screen Test, and you're not allowed to tell anyone or l'll smash your face in. Alright?
what's Screen Test? - Exactly. Top secret.
- Oh, shit. lt's Lawrence.
get up there. - What?
get up there! Go! Come on!
Lawrence. - You made them pirates of Rambo?
Yeah. l was just doing it.
don't use my camera for that Screen Test bollocks.
l wasn't! Honest! Lawrence, get 'em off me!
get off!
come on. - Get off! Ow!
more torture?
Yeah. lt's not my day.
Oh, yeah, stay there. l'll be back in a minute.
Hello, mate. - Ooh-ohh!
what is that all about? - Ooh-ohh!
happy birthday, bro.
you... Oi!
you thought l'd forgot, didn't you?
these are very nice. Thanks, mate. - Cheers, mate.
dont push it.
dont push it or Ill give you a war you wont believe.
- Let it go.
you dont wanna accept the fact that youre dealing with an expert in guerrilla warfare, with a man whos the best with guns, with knives, with his bare hands, a man whos been trained to ignore pain, ignore weather, to live off the land, to eat things that would make a billy goat puke.
in Vietnam, his job was to dispose of enemy personnel. To kill. Period.
win by attrition.
well, Rambo was the best.
are you telling me 200 men against your boy is a no-win situation?
you send that many, don't forget... - What?
a good supply of body bags.
200 men!
he's gone.
you can come down now.
do you have any last requests?
Oi, stuntman, your face was well funny on that one.
- Henry, come back here!
who are you?
who are you?
l am the son of Rambo!
what have you done with my Dad?
No!
the sins you commit are for the good of others.
come on, Dad. We're going home.
the wheel is mans greatest invention, but it is the greatest bringer of death.
you told anyone you were over at my house?
l swear to God, if you tell anyone l'm making this film, l'll smash your face in. You still owe me, right?
so be at my house at ten tomorrow.
and don't be late.
we've finished watching TV now. You can come back in.
you'll learn something very much to your advantage.
Yes, l promise to astonish you with news of how a river can operate above the level of the flood plain, OK?
and how do they do that? How does a river operate above the level of the flood plain? ls it because it's a bit arrogant, thinks it's a bit better than the flood plain, or is it because of active deposition of silt in times of flood?
arrogant river? Deposition of silt?
lt is actually the silt, and l'm going to show you...
erm, the silt goes into a sort of super silt.
bless, O Lord, this food to our use and bless us to your service, make us mindful of the needs of others, through Jesus Christ, Amen.
only you could lose something strapped to your wrist.
l should've taken it off you.
don't go in that shed again. Do you understand?
do you understand?!
l need you all up early for the preaching tomorrow.
but l can't come. - Of course you can.
no, see, there's this boy at school... - There's lots of boys.
no, l mean... This one was badly hurt, and l promised to help him with his chores tomorrow.
what happened to him?
he... He had a terrible accident, and l promised l'd help him with his chores tomorrow.
that's...
that's very kind of you.
look, l'm sorry for getting angry all the time.
lt's... Anyway, you can go and help this boy if you want.
Thanks, Mummy.
two minutes.
good morning, Lee Carter. l'm here to help you!
Jesus Christ!
Oi! The bacon's burning!
get in that bush.
l'm waiting in the bush. Shhh!
who was it? - Oh, some Bible-basher. Here.
want brown sauce on that or what?
Oi! What about my tea?
ready? - Ready!
three, two, one, go!
you alright? - l'm alright, Lee Carter!
ready? - Yep, ready!
and action!
cut! Cut!
and cut. Great.
ready? - Yep, ready!
right. Action!
great. Cut. You alright, Will?
you alright, buddy?
- What are you doing?
l am the son of Rambo!
hang on. You wanna be the son of Rambo?
l have to go now. - Come back tomorrow.
l ain't finished yet. - OK. Bye, then.
Oh, and l'm glad your legs are feeling better.
nutcase.
l don't know if l've made enough for five.
l could share mine with you, if you like, Brother Joshua.
Oh, no. Well, erm,... that won't be...
l'm not staying. l just...
l'll see you in the morning for prayer meeting.
Yes!
Ah. You all set? - Mother had an accident in the night.
Ah. Oh, dear. - Two minutes.
of course.
l tried to dress Grandma, but Jess took over.
William,... your shoes.
you got something else to wear? We're leaving for prayer meeting now.
Oh, William. - Shall l take them to the menders'
and meet you there?
mummy! Grandma's lying on the floor!
Yes. Meet us there. Sorry about this.
not a problem.
good morning, William. - Good morning, Brother Joshua.
should be ready by three o'clock.
thank you.
keep it in a straight line, woman!
this is why l won't let you drive! - Jesus!
l've got everything!
Yeah, l can see that, you freak!
Wow! - Thanks.
l think that's everyone.
l'm sure he'll wait for us here.
what's the dog thingy? - That's the flying dog.
he guards the prison where the scarecrow keeps my dad, Rambo.
right, and why have they got him prisoner?
he's an evil scarecrow.
and then you save him, yeah?
Yes!
OK, we'll do your story, but we're doing it my way.
lt doesn't mean l have to split the prize with you, OK?
Yes, Colonel! Whoo-hoo!
son of Rambo, Take One. Click.
OK, ready and action!
l've come to save you, Rambo!
we need to leave here right now before the evil scarecrow finds us!
Oh. What about my tea?
Oh, son, it's like a prison with them lot marching in and out every five minutes, shouting at you, turning you over while you're trying to sleep.
"eat your food," they say. lt's not fit for dogs.
and the screams at night. There's folk screaming in their beds.
but l don't know if they're hurting or just... afraid of something.
l'm rescuing you, Father! We're going to escape!
l need to spend a penny first.
lord have mercy! What are you doing? l'll kill you! Get out of here!
they make you look so stupid! They should be ashamed what they do to you.
the boy's taking me home.
the boys was just pretending. You're not going nowhere, pops.
you're staying in your room.
Yes.
they're on our trails.
you'd better swing across the lake. l'll get back up.
meet you in the prison in one hour.
don't worry, l'm trained to ignore pain and live off the land.
just go!
they're firing at us! Take cover!
OK!
Yeah, keep swimming to the other side.
l can't swim!
what do you mean, you can't swim?
Oh, shit!
thank you for coming to save me, Colonel Trautman.
l'll just have to say l got lost or something. l don't know.
lf this film doesn't win Screen Test, l'm gonna be a monkey's uncle.
right, come on. We're gonna be blood brothers now.
what's blood brothers? - Come here.
how long do we have to hold it like this for?
until we hear that wood pigeon again.
l gave your watch to my brother.
Oh, so l won't ever get it back, then?
no. He likes it.
wasn't mine anyway. lt was my dad's.
ls he pissed off with you?
he's dead.
Oh. Right.
how did he die? - Mowing the lawn.
lt wasn't the mowing that did it, you idiot.
he had a thing called an aneurysm.
a little vein in his head popped, and that was that.
he just, sort of, fell to the ground and the lawnmower kept going and tipped up and... into the fence and made this really loud noise as if it was hungry or something.
lt kept going " Rrrr, " until they switched it off.
Jesus! l hope my veins don't pop. - Me, too.
my brother said you can kill someone with one punch.
Really? Yeah. lf you hit 'em right in the nose, their bone goes up through their brain and kills 'em.
Wow! Has he ever killed anyone like that?
no. He could if he wanted to, though. He's pretty skill at everything.
do you like him?
well, yeah, course l do. He's my brother, isn't he?
what about your dad?
my dad? No. He pissed off before l was born.
then my mum met Colin, the bloke with the big hair? He owns the care home, so we all live there. lt's alright, l suppose.
but he lives in Spain, so my mum's always over there with him.
she gets tons of duty-free and stuff, which is kind of skill, cos it's mostly just me and Lawrence.
we get to do what we want, muck about. There's no-one to tell us off.
seriously, though, parents...
you're pretty much better off without them. That's what l say.
Colonel Trautman. - Yeah?
not including the bit about losing my dad's watch, this has been my best day of all time.
Oh! We've scabbed.
o my God, l've come to say thank you for your love today.
thank you for my family and all the friends you give to me.
guard me in the dark of night and in the morning, send your light.
Amen.
he's been lying, Mary.
he's confused. He's trying to be a good Samaritan.
you've had more than your share of loss in life, and none of us wants to see you lose your son to outsiders, but you must speak with him now.
warn him. Let him know that the path he is on can lead only to misery, not just for himself but for all of you.
there's a group meeting tomorrow. l thought it might do him good to come along, get him back on track.
could you get him out of school? - Of course. l'll make sure he's ready.
Well,... good night, Mary.
and the Lord must greatly resent the attempt to pursue a double life that goes hand in hand with the world and presuming to be fully brethren at the same time.
hear, hear.
God is faithful, who has called us into the fellowship of his Son.
lt works out that way, instead of being enticed.
God doesn't entice anybody into evil.
we're enticed, led astray, by our own flesh, according to the scripture.
Oi, you! Come back!
come on, then! - Oi, you! Come back!
see ya!
my father won't send us to your school. He said the pupils are a bad influence.
ls it true, Brother William?
l suppose so.
what are you looking at?
well, you'll be wearing this stuff one day, mate.
thank you for taking him, Joshua.
we all need a little guidance from time to time.
l'd hoped he might see me as a kind of father figure.

Shhh.
when l was your age, l always used to walk past this bakery on the way to prayer meeting.
one day l heard the most wonderful music coming from the radio inside, and it really was like,...
like the sweetest hymn l'd ever heard.
I couldnt get it out of my head.
l always used to walk past hoping to hear it again, but l never did.
so I found a record player.
l bought the song from a record shop, and l had to hum the tune to the salesman, because l didn't know its name. l couldn't wait to get it home.
I was so excited. I wanted my mum and dad to hear it.
he was protecting me...
and our way of life.
promise me you'll put these things out of your mind, William.
l promise. - l know it's hard, but...
it's for your own good in the long run.
l'll never betray the Brethren again.
l promise.
good night, my darling.

l don't care what you and your so-called mates say about me, but don't you ever, ever call my brother a scab!
you know, at least he's there for me! At least he cares about me, which is more than l can say for you. You're a two-faced fake like the rest of them. l'm gutted it took me this long to work it out.
l'm gutted l fell for it. Lawrence is better than all you lot put together, and he's all l've got, alright? He's all l've got.
I didnt come back for you anyway.
Where's my camera?
lee Carter! Get out!
William, do you know where your friend lives?
we need to contact his family.
sister Mary? - Brother Joshua.
we've come to discuss your future with the Brethren.
Mary, l feel it best to come straight to the point.
we've had a group meeting, and it has been decided that this must be your final warning.
lf the boy isn't corrected, l'm afraid you and the family would face expulsion from the Brethren.
l need to talk to you.
lt's just me. Please come out of there.
l've spoilt everything!
everything's ruined!
Shh.
are they going to throw us out?
Shh. Shh. Everything's alright.
l found a present in the garden.
Bye! See you! Bye!
Thanks.
Thanks.
Thanks. Thank you.
thank you.
Bye! Au revoir! - Bye.
Bye! Bye!
l'm sorry.
what's he saying?
he said you're his brother. - Look, this isn't my fault.
he just wants you to take this home for him.
look at the state of it!
lt's ruined.
he's been a very brave little boy, Mr Carter.
you did! l watched you do it!
mum, it's Lawrence.
Lawrence! - You always get so violent!
well, it's not a good time for me, either!
what?

would you like to get down, love?
my mother wouldn't let me get down till l'd finished everything on my plate.
didn't the warning mean anything to you, Mary?
you know what happens if you don't teach him properly.
Hurray!

at least hes there for me. At least he cares about me.
which is more than I can say for you! Youre a two-faced fake!

Hello, Lee Carter.
my brother is the worst actor ever.
- He is pretty bad.
Yeah. He's even worse than that bloody French kid.
- We'd better go.
Yeah.
Thanks.
son of Rambo? - Yes, Colonel?
this has been my best day of all time.
by the way, you spelt the title slightly wrong.
theres no W in Rambo. - Oh. OK.
it was still good, though.
Hi, Lennart, it's Pelle. - Hi, Pelle.
[cough]
this bloody cough! - Terrible!
it was good of you to come.
sorry, Lennart, didn't catch that. - It was good of you to come!
well sure, you asked me to, but I can wait outside.
no, no, no. Stay here. I'm flying to Barcelona at three.
right then.
you're not pleased, so I hear.
no, actually I'm not, Lennart. I think it's a shame.
this is no fun. We'll soon be up to 700.
who said anything about fun?
you know very well we have to make it to a thousand.
you really mean that, Lennart?
I do.
[splash]
everything has its day, Pelle.
Yes, but...
the pyramids had their day.
of course they did.
steam engines had their day. - Sorry... didn't quite catch that.
steam engines had their day.
that's true.
this is a new day and age, Pelle. You have to realize that.
true enough, but still...
if this keeps up we'll have to shut down entirely.
that would be a disaster for a lot of people.
what's that got to do with us?
you have a point... - We won't be around then, Pelle.
sorry, Lennart, what do you mean?
I mean, what's the point of staying where there is only misery?
no, there's no point.
when that day comes I'll be long gone...
...and so should you!
beloved be the ones who sit down.
songs FROM THE SECOND FLOOR
very nice!
Oh yes, the old boy must look his best.
pelle Wigert wants to meet me today.
and what does he want?
we'll have to wait and see.
Lasse...
it would be nice if you could be home today when I have my day off.
sure, but how would that look?
I haven't missed a day in 14 years.
it would be nice just the same.
everything has its day, dear.
there's a time for work and there's a time for other things.
no, no, no! No, no!
everything has its day, dear.
you old bore!
Bye.
so long, traitor!
would you let go now! - No, no, no, no!
pull yourself together, Lasse. - No, no, no, no!
pull yourself together!
I've been here for 30 years!
I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.
I've been here for 30 years! - There's nothing I can do.
I've been here for 30 years!
there's nothing I can do.
there's nothing I can do!
but I've been here for 30 years! - There's nothing I can do.
I've been here for 30 years, Pelle!
I've been here for 30 years!
[Knocking]

no, there isn't.
he's not here!
close the door!
excuse me, is Allan Svensson here?
what are you doing here?
what the hell are you doing here?
he's talking to you. - What do you want?
I look for man, he not here. - Speak clearly!
what did you say? - I look for man, he not here.
what's up?
who are you looking for? - Allan Svensson.
what the hell are you doing here?
[He's screaming.]
Lasse... You - who?
what happened?
such heavy traffic!
even though it's so late...
what's wrong, Pelle?
we'll buy a new golf club.
we'll buy a new one!
may I have a volunteer?
over here!
there's one there! - Welcome up on stage!
no, leave me alone.
please, come over here.
may I take that for you? - Sure.
Ow!
[Laughs]
[He's screaming.]
Ow! Ow! Ow!!!
when are you going to get a divorce?
when will you do it?
answer me!
let's move along a bit then, shall we?
move? Oh. Right.
there we go. - Thanks.
[They are singing.]
you have to believe me, Krister.
you "have to" believe me!
I'm stuck here!
I haven't advanced more than a few hundred yards in four hours!
Hi. - Hi.
Krister, I swear...
Hi. - Hiya.
darling, what shall I do?
how are you?
what can I say?
it's not easy being human.
I agree.
you saw your boy's there. - Yeah.
he's been sitting and waiting for hours.
you think I look like this without reason?
no.
dare I ask what you've done?
done? I'm ruined.
my whole business has burned to the ground.
what's that?
I said, the entire business has gone up in smoke!
[The glass falls.]
Hi.
what have you done?
I'm ruined.
don't you see?
my whole business has gone up in smoke.
look at this...
the books!
nothing could be saved.
it's a fortune!
maybe it's just as well...
is that what you have to say to your father, when he's in trouble?
I've been waiting for you.
I want to talk to you.
about what?
you know - the future.
how everything's going to... be.
what we're going to do.
how we're going to get by.
how we're going to put food on the table.
enjoy ourselves.
does anyone know how to get out of here?
no.
you could have called.
something terrible has happened.
my whole business has burned to the ground.
nothing but ashes...
I'm the one who set fire to it.
and I think I'll be discovered.
don't you see? - Dear God!
I'm the one who set fire to it!
I think I'll be discovered.
[He's crying.]
you see that crazy traffic over there?
it hasn't moved in over 8 hours. No one knows why.
it seems the whole town is on the road.
everyone going the same direction.
makes you wonder, you know, where they're headed...
...the people.
do you know where they're headed? Where they are going?
well...
do you want some bread? - No, I'm fine, thanks.
it's good. There's mustard on it. - No, thanks.
you live around here?
not anymore.
what the hell are you doing here, then?
I was just passing by.
I used to live up there.
at the top, to the left of the drain pipe.
Really?
I got thrown out. - Thrown out?
Yeah, she didn't want me anymore.
man, that's sad. I'm so sorry to hear that.
God damn...
ask me, I know.
what's her name?
Susanne.
Susanne...
Susanne, don't be so cruel! - Shhh!
open your door to a man who hungers and thirsts.
don't be so cruel, Susanne!
damn, what beasts!
maybe there's more...
Susanne!
don't be so cruel, Susanne!
open your door to a man who hungers and thirsts.
who the hell is that? How do you know him?
I don't know who it is.
you've got to believe me, Micke!
it's true... I don't know who it is.
Yes, well naturally, I tried to put it out.
but it was impossible.
I was about to catch fire myself.
you see here before you a fortune turned to ashes.
everything seems to happen to me!
one catastrophe after another.
have there been other fires?
no, there haven't.
there are other catastrophes besides fires.
that are much worse.
I have two sons.
the oldest...
...he's seriously ill. - I'm sorry to hear that.
Yeah, he's lost his mind. Writing poetry made him nuts.
Oh dear!
Yes, it's terrible.
what's a few charred pieces of furniture compared with that?
nothing!
of course, they were expensive.
well... not this one.
but there was a Chippendale suite over there.
a sofa.
two armchairs.
top quality!
78000.0
do you have that on paper?
paper?
obviously, they've gone up in smoke.
but a Chippendale is a Chippendale.
even if it doesn't say it on paper!
you, for example.
you are who you are, whether or not anybody's made note of it.
aren't you? - I suppose.
Yep, we'll just have to believe it.
this, this is my youngest son.
they're from the insurance company
or so they say...
so, we'll just... have to take their word for it.
[The crowd is screaming.]
in case you have trouble understanding this, you may as well join the demonstration and do some good.
stock prices are falling.
the country's in a very bad way.
they're fighting for better times and here you stand and quibble over a sofa and a few armchairs.
[Screaming]
[Screaming]
Hi, Tomas!
here we go again...
what have I done, Tomas? What have I done wrong?
he's not answering. He's not answering today either.
can't even say "hi" to his own father!
he's been writing poetry and it made him nuts.
it's okay, Tomas.
the kids are fine.
elisabeth too.
I drop by now and then.
you don't have to worry about them.
or about the cab. I drive as much as I can.
it's a lucky thing somebody's taking care of business!
he's left his cab and family high and dry.
writing poetry till he went nuts.
it's awful! It's just awful!
[The father is crying.]
beloved be the unknown man and his wife.
my fellow man with sleeves, neck and eyes!
beloved be the one who sleeps on his back.
the one who wears a torn shoe in the rain.
beloved be the bald man without hat.
the one who catches a finger in a door.
catches a finger... What's so special about that?
it's happened to everyone. Writing poetry made him nuts.
beloved be the one who sweats out of pain or out of shame.
what kind of nonsense is this? Give me my smock.
the smock!
the one who pays with what he does not have...
there was a wallet here too. Where is it?
beloved be the ones who sit down.
sit down?!
what's with that? - Calm down now!
beloved be the one who sits down?!
easy!
why should you love him, eh?
look at that brother of yours. - Take it easy!
he sits where he sits.
no yelling in here. Calm down now.
sit down, sit down...
he sits where he sits!
who's going to come along and love him, then?
can no one help him?
it's good of the Father to let me come and talk to him.
see, it's like this...
[He's crying.]
my entire business has gone up in smoke.
it's nothing but ashes.
and I have a son who's gone mad.
makes you wonder what you've done wrong...
you can't talk to him.
he doesn't respond.
I'm at my wits' end.
at your wits end... So, who isn't?
I've been trying to sell my house for four years.
no such luck.
Yep, I'll lose 200 thousand - at least.
that's a shame.
a shame. A real shame.
what about me, then? I paid for a trip and then the travel agency went bankrupt, the money's gone.
it's all because of the stock prices.
they... they go up and down.
it's frightful! - I quite agree.
beloved be the one who sits down.
I beg your pardon?
beloved be the one who sits down.
[music]
we can go with this.
[She's crying.]
when are you going to do it?
you could answer at least!
it's nice to sit down for a bit.
I've walked all the way from North Station.
I thought...
lt'll be quicker to walk, I thought.
in chaos like this, that just goes on without anyone being able to give a reasonable explanation.
but it was a long way!
longer than I thought.
I'm in a hurry. I'm late.
I overslept.
I had nightmares. - Oh dear!
where are we going?
I'm going to visit our former Commander-in-chief who has a birthday today.
he's turned a hundred. - I see...
where does he live?
where do you think someone lives who's reached such a venerable age and who doesn't have to pinch his pennies.
St. George's rest home.
St. George's. OK.
a lot of people will be paying their respects.
Admiral Bengtsson is going to make a speech.
and can you guess who wrote the speech?
no.
I did.
that's my main job these days, writing speeches...
but it still makes me nervous every time.
terribly nervous.
fact is, I had to nip into the Grand Hotel and have a drink.
I needed one.
well, three... to be perfectly honest.
so now I'm actually quite pleased with what I've written.
my approach was a rather philosophical one.
about being human year after year...
this is how I see it...
life is time and time is a stretch of road.
that makes life a journey, a trip.
don't you think so? - Yes.
I guess you could look at it that way.
yet in order to travel you need a map and a compass.
otherwise you wouldn't know where you were.
would you? - No.
and our map and compass...
...are our traditions.
our heritage, our history.
aren't they? - Yeah, sure.
if we don't understand this...
before we know it, we're fumbling around in the dark.
where are we?
well, actually we haven't moved more than a few yards.
we haven't? - No.
they keep delivering more flowers!
sure they do - when someone celebrates his 100th birthday!
and has been so clever! Become both a general and a millionaire!
Millionaire?! To put it mildly!
he's one of the largest landowners in the country.
20,000 acres of cultivated land and twice as much forest.
how much is that? 60,000 acres.
how many square meters is that?
240 million, isn't it? - Exactly!
two hundred and forty million square meters of land.
and eight lakes on his property.
fantastic! - Unbelievable!
really.
uh - oh. I think it's time for the bed-pan.
Anna, the bed-pan! - Coming...
they're here now.
they're here now.
right honorable general and Commander-in-chief Emeritus.
it is man's fate to grow older.
year is added to year, experience to experience during our never-ending journey around the sun.
honored general and, if I may say so, dear colleague.
few people are privileged to have completed such a large number of orbits around the sun as you, sir, have done.
today when you set out on a new orbit, your 101st, l, as an active member of the joint Chiefs of Staff, have the task, pleasure and honor on behalf of all branches of the armed forces to extend our hearty congratulations to you, sir as a person and as a human being and as a representative of the safeguarding of our country, our traditions our distinctive character and our history.
my best to Goering!
I beg your pardon? - My best to Goering.
sound the regiment's recognition signal.
hoist the flags!
hoist the flags!
hoist the flags!
[bugle]
where have you been? - Sorry...?
Hi!
what do you mean, "been"? I've been all over.
I've driven all over town around and around...
...and listened to people with problems.
I asked where you've been!
yeah... and then...
well, then I felt like having a beer.
at least three, to be honest.
at least six, to be honest.
you could have called.
seven, to be perfectly honest.
you didn't need to come here.
for Christ's sake, should just sell that damned car this minute.
Tomas can't drive a cab.
he's too soft.
he takes everything to heart.
What?!
what's wrong? Am I not allowed here?
why not? - You don't love me.
beloved be the one who sits down.
beloved be the one who sits down!
...who sits down.
beloved be the one...
Rune...
do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
in other words...
if you want me to make you happy, you have to make me happy.
right?
but you haven't done that! You've made me damned disappointed.
have you seen the nails?
you come here, you sit down and start talking business without any cash. Who the hell do you think you are?
I was thinking you could give them to me on credit, Uffe. 30 days...
30 days?! Who the hell knows what could happen to you in 30 days?
I'm really in a bind, Uffe.
Kalle! Well, I'll be damned!
you're here this year too! - Yeah, so they say...
alive and kicking! And here I was thinking you'd burnt to death.
How're you doing?
Oh, you know how it is, Uffe, in times like these.
you have to struggle for every crumb.
try to find something you can sell with an extra zero on the end...
in that case you've come to the right place, Kalle. Take a seat!
Hi, Kalle. - Hiya.
sit down. - Sure.
so, this is what you're up to this year.
Yes, I too have to survive.
here is the product you can put two extra zeros on.
you think so? - Think?!
we're heading for the year 2000. Two thousand, Kalle!
and this here is the birthday boy.
you get a chance like this only once in a lifetime.
it'll be another thousand years before this man is as important again.
I guess I won't be around then.
this, this suits you, Kalle.
it suits an old furniture salesman.
come here. Between you and me... check it out.
there are already too many in on the champagne and fireworks.
choose three sizes.
take along an order-book. Get out there and make some money!
yeah... I don't know, Uffe. I'm so tired.
I already have a cross to bear.
the insurance company is giving me a hard time.
besides my son has gone mad.
he what...?
Yeah, he's been writing poetry and it made him nuts.
well, it won't be a bread winner but that'll blow over.
it'll blow over, Kalle.
you think so? - You shouldn't think so damn much.
it's not good.
[The man is screaming.]
what happened? - That's a good question.
he's stuck. He's stuck in the door.
well, that's pretty damned obvious. But how did it happen?
he slipped, I guess.
slipped? - Yes.
how clumsy can you get? - It could happen to anyone.
he slipped and fell backwards and hit his other arm against the door.
and it shut. - Well, it's clumsy all the same!
try to take it easy. We'll help you in a minute.
my colleague will come and open the door carefully from the inside.
here he is now. He's opening the door now.
that's not so bad. - That wasn't so bad now, was it?
it wasn't so bad.
it wasn't so bad, was it?
poor man! It could happen to the best of us.
our son got himself stuck in a deckchair last year.
no, it was three years ago! - Wasn't it last year?
no, it was three years ago.
what about me! I got my finger caught in a dresser drawer and it really hurt. And that was ten years ago.
and look, you can still see the gash.
Hi. - Hi.
it's been ages... - Yes, it has.
it really became barren.
you really scared me, Sven. - I did?
Yes, you did.
I suddenly felt really guilty.
when I caught sight of you, Sven.
you understand, I guess.
you know what I thought? - No.
as a matter of fact, I thought you were dead, Sven.
I heard you'd committed suicide.
Yes, that's right.
for Christ's sake, Sven! Why did you do that?
I had no choice.
Sven, am I to blame?
is it my fault? - I didn't say that.
[Russian]
he's so unhappy, the poor boy.
what does he want? - He's gone astray, got lost.
are you looking for me? - He's looking for his sister.
sister? - Yes, his sister.
the Germans hanged her over in Russia...
[Russian]
then they hanged him too.
he's so very unhappy, because he didn't have time to apologize to her.
if I've understood correctly. - Apologize, for what?
he'd done something mean.
hurt her, I think.
and regretted it, but he didn't get a chance to make it up to her.
[Russian]
please! - That's awful!
I can't bear to listen.
what had they done? Why did they hang them?
something to do with being from the wrong race, I think.
what? - They belonged to the wrong race.
Oh dear, oh dear...
what happens now? What's he going to do now?
who? - The boy.
what do you mean, "do"? He can't do anything.
that's why he's so sad.
don't you see?
he didn't get a chance to make amends with his sister before he died while she was still alive.
then he was hanging there himself from the rope...
that's why it's so tragic.
because he can't do anything can't even try...
he's dead.
they both are.
Sven, how much did I borrow from you?
was it 280,000?
no, I know, it was 287...
excuse me for saying so, Sven, I'm only being honest with you...
...but I was relieved when I heard you were dead.
now I don't have to pay back the money, I thought to myself.
there wasn't any papers. I was free from my debt...
[Russian]
good God, Sven, what should I do?
I can't very well pay back the money now, can I?
to me? That would be difficult.
I'm only human, Sven.
a man does the best he can struggles to get a bit...
...of food on the table.
and enjoy himself.
Jesus...
he wasn't the son of God.
he was just a nice guy.
that's why he was crucified.
he was tormented and killed. - What?
he was tormented and killed.
who? - Jesus.
he was crucified. - Of course he was.
because he was a nice guy.
Hi, Tomas.
hello. - Hi.
you could at least say "hi"!
when your grandma's here and all! - Take it easy.
forgive me, Tomas.
I had something fun to tell you.
I've got a new business concept. - Me too.
I've got a business concept too, but it's secret.
imagine, Tomas...
the insurance company gave in.
and why do you think they did that?
you've got to be able to speak up for yourself.
speak plainly and you'll get results...
you can write poems with words too.
it's not that.
why complicate things, Tomas?
life is a market.
it's as simple as that.
it's all about buying something you can sell with an extra zero.
or two.
the whole world knows that everyone but you, it seems.
is there no one who can help you?
is there no one who can help you?! - Take it easy!
writing poetry till you went nuts, huh?
easy does it.
it's awful!
is there no one who can help him?
is there no one who can help him?
...that's why he was crucified.
...who can help him? - Calm down.
is there no one who can help him?
it would of course be an advantage if the chairman of the Economic Faculty's council of experts could at this point present at least the main features of the long-term perspectives and strategies which the council would like to propose to the government.
Long-term... I don't know if I have those with me here today, but the short-term ones should be here somewhere...
one moment, please.
strange. I'm sure I had them this morning.
this is obviously not good.
it appears that we shall have to skip the strategies and concentrate on tactics instead.
but before we do so, we should perhaps attempt to summarize what we've discussed here today.
it's difficult, I know.
our discussion has lasted over eight hours but is there anyone who feels they'd like to have a try?
anyone?
professor Frank, for example, hasn't said anything for a long time.
well, I agree with what most of the others have had to say today.
all we can do is hope.
would Dr Wendt care to comment on that?
the house across the street, it's moving.
I don't follow you. - It's moving.
that house over there.
what do you mean, "moving"? - It's moving!
that's right, it is!
what kind of nonsense is that?
hey...
it's moving...
it is moving! - It really is!
take it easy! Take it easy!
the doors open inwards. Back up! Hey!
it's very important we don't lose control.
very... important!
what papers are you looking for?
what papers?
an official report.
a very troublesome report which is supposed to clarify why we can't afford to work.
you'll just have to write a new one!
try to remember what was in it.
write a new one!
what was in it?
there wasn't very much in it.
it's hard, it's very hard to explain why we can't afford to work.
it's impossible!
it's not us who decide that sort of thing.
we're not the ones who decide.
we must understand that.
it's fate that decides.
not us. Fate.
who can decide over fate?
not us anyway.
all we can do is try to appeal to fate.
that's all we can do.
[Russian]
[Russian]
[Russian]
you'll have to forgive me, but I'm afraid I can't help you, because I can't understand what you're saying.
[Russian]
like I said, I can't help you.
help!
Ow! I'm stuck!
enough is enough! Get out of here!
well now, Anna. From what we've heard you're feeling fine, not sick or anything.
Yep, very healthy. - I see.
she's very healthy. - She is, is she?
and you're doing well in school.
you're good at reading and writing from what your mum and dad tell us.
I see.
have you read many books? - Yes, a few.
I see.
you see, these ladies and gentlemen sitting here...
...they've read all the books. - That's right! An awful lot!
Yes, most of them! - Yes.
and when you've read that much, well, then you also know an awful lot.
Yes, and we also have the benefit of experience.
quite right.
long experience, I might add.
Yes, indeed.
that's how you know and how to do it.
and, Anna, there's one more thing you know if you've read that much.
you know what can't be done, what's impossible.
Exactly!
because you can't do just anything.
certainly not.
an ant, for example, can't eat up an elephant. It's impossible.
right.
and when it's your birthday, well, not everyone can come to the party.
if they did, then everyone would get a piece of cake this little.
no bigger than a crumb! - So small you could hardly see it!
that wouldn't be such a fun party. - No, darn it!
I can see you understand that.
but there are other things, Anna, that are impossible and that can't be done.
that you can't really understand when you're small only when you're big and have read many, many books.
and then there's also experience. You mustn't forget that!
no, absolutely not. - No...
Aaaah!
[music]
I can't get up.
help! I can't get up!
we have sacrificed the bloom of youth.
what more can we do?
nothing.
what? - Nothing, absolutely nothing
what more can we do?
where are we? - Huh?
where are we?
at the Grand Hotel, for Christ's sake!
Oh...
what more can we do?
what?
but, where are we? - I can't get up.
where are we? - I can't get up.
where are we? - I can't get up.
what's wrong now, then, Robert?
it's heavy, Pelle. I can't take it any more.
you have to, Robert. You have to try!
come on!
hang in there, Pelle! You've got to hang on!
Yes, I know. I know.
there's a time for everything. - Sure, right.
Pelle!
there's a time for misery.
sure, I know there is.
but it'll soon be over.
only a few more yards and we'll have left this damned dump under the clouds for good.
Yes. Let's hope so.
as free men, Pelle. - Sure, right. Sure...
free at last! - Yes!
and then we'll only have ourselves to think about.
right, sure, that'll be nice.
and do what we feel like!
sure. Sounds good.
do we not deserve that, Pelle?
aren't we worth it, when we've worked so hard?
only a few more yards!
a new day is dawning!
come on then!
there's a time for everything, Tomas.
there's a time for everything.
your time will come, Tomas.
it will... I know that.
it's not true that no one cares about poetry.
they just pretend they don't.
right now...
they're just pretending.
that's how it is. I know.
beloved be the one who works by the day, by the month, by the hour.
beloved be the one who sweats out of pain or out of shame.
the person who goes, at the order of his hands, to the movies.
the one who pays with what he does not have...
the one who sleeps on his back.
[Tomas is crying.]
the one who no longer remembers his childhood.
stop it, Stefan! You'll only make him unhappy.
you mustn't be unhappy, Tomas. You mustn't cry!
take it easy, Tomas, it doesn't matter.
beloved be the one who sits down.
it's okay to cry.
that's what you should do when you're unhappy.
Jesus did. - What?
Jesus cried when he was on the cross.
he hurt so much.
he was crucified...
...because he was a kind person.
kind?
Tomas is kind, too...
...but he's got no head for business.
of course you're unhappy!
Jesus didn't either. He just hurt.
Yeah, sure.
he was tormented to death because he was kind.
he wasn't the son of God.
he was just a kind person.
sure.
beloved be the just man without thorns.
[Tomas is crying.]
the bald man without hat.
the thief without roses.
the one who wears a watch and has seen God.
the one who has honor and does not die!
are you here, Uffe?
it's been a long time.
I'm ashamed, Kalle.
I'm ashamed.
it was a bad idea. - Yeah...
the worst I ever had.
shit!
damn it all!
how could I be so stupid?
out of my mind.
to think you can make money on a crucified loser!
God dammit, I blush to think of it!
what a fucking dud product!
I haven't kept up with the times!
that's the bitter truth.
but I'm going to get my act together, Kalle.
we'll have to find something else to sell with a few extra zeros on it.
if I think of something...
I'll call. Bye, Kalle!
is that Sven?
is that you, Sven?
why are you following me, Sven?
why are you tormenting me?
I can't make it up to you.
how could I do that?
you have no relatives.
what can I do?
Sven!
can we not treat each other decently?
forget it all.
the past... Just look ahead!
I'd be really happy if we could do that, Sven.
you have to see it from my perspective.
I can't take it any more.
I can't take it any more!
l just can't take it any more!
what the hell is this?
how much can you ask of a person?
you do what you can.
you struggle......to get a bit of food on the table.
[He's crying.]
and enjoy yourself.
[music]
they sell birdseed, I see. - You kidding me, man?
in the back. - All right.
white boy was right.
M-4s.
niners had a special order.
full auto, laser scopes.
niggers still couldn't hit shit.
load the M-4s and Glocks in the truck, huh?
what about the other guns and shit?
torch it.
Hey, Louise.
you know, you can buy these by the case.
be a lot cheaper.
no. A box at a time keeps me humble.
get a pack of smokes, too, darling.
it was my favorite.
what the hell is that?
Oh, shit!
what the hell happened?
propane tanks caught fire.
ammo was in there. The place just blew.
the fire dick says it was arson.
saw a lot of boot prints.
cowboy boots? - Yeah. I think so.
shit-eating Mayans, man.
where the hell was Rodrigo? - No sign of your watchman.
what's the exposure?
officially?
me and the fire department.
the fire captain can be convinced to rethink his report.
unofficially?
unofficially, this blast was seen in two counties.
this location is dead.
Jesus Christ.
the M-4s? - Gone.
as are most of the Glocks.
get the fireman on board.
let's get out of here.
you gotta see something else.
do we really?
Goddamn.
fried and refried.
illegals. Part of our assembly crew.
found them before the FD went through.
after the smoke clears, get rid of the bodies.
what am I supposed to tell our boys up in Oaktown?
I'm supposed to deliver five cases to Laroy and his crew before tomorrow.
call the gangsta hotline, set a meeting.
two in the back of the head. Quick and painless.
it ain't easy being king.
you remember that.
some days you're the Beamer, some days you're the goddamn deer.
how the hell you you want me to get it out of there?
come on. Jesus, man.
just pretend it's "carve your own steak night" at Sizzler.
I don't eat meat, man.
figure it out, Grunt.
what the hell happened?
Mayans torched the warehouse.
stole the Niners' M-4s. - Holy shit.
Clay's gone to sit down with Laroy, try to buy some time.
niners already paid for that hardware.
that's the tricky part.
Hey, Ma.
did you go to storage?
not yet.
hope there's something you can use.
haven't looked through that baby stuff in years.
I'm sure anything will help.
still coming to dinner tomorrow night?
I'm picking up steaks from the German.
Oh, you know it.
you should bring Chibs and that new kid.
new kid doesn't eat meat.
don't patch him in. Can't trust anyone doesn't eat meat.
Hey, you heard from my crazy ex-wife at all?
never answers her goddamn phone.
that's 'cause she knows it's you.
she's supposed to be sending me the doctor bills. Haven't seen one in weeks.
I'll go by on my way home. I'll check in on her.
thanks...
grandma.
asshole.
long ride from Charming to Oakland.
how come Easy Rider meeting me face to face?
assembly warehouse burned down.
all the guns, including your M-4s, blown to shit.
there's zero balance due on that hardware.
the shipment - going to be a little late. - That can't happen.
got a shipment of my own coming in.
very important cargo.
I been doing business with the One-Niners for a long time.
I always respected our arrangement.
I never sold "gun one" to the Mexicans.
now I need for you to show me a little respect, and give me a few more days for delivery.
don't give a shit about history or respect.
this is about business, old man.
and I'm telling you, brother, giving me some more time...
really smart business.
you got till Sunday.
I don't get those M-4s by then, there's going to be some new black faces cruising the streets of Charming.
and a burned-down warehouse going to be the least of your problems.
for my sons.
Thomas, who is already at peace.
and Jackson, may he never know this life of chaos.
just here. - Half-Sack.
piney clogged the toilet again.
Jesus Christ. That guy shits more than a grizzly, man. It ain't human.
here, just put it right here under the...
where did you get that name?
Half-Sack?
I got my left nut blown off by an aper frag in Iraq.
look at that guy. - Jesus Christ!
put that deformed nut bag away, will you?
sorry, pal. - Disappear.
go on.
find Jax.
we're at the table. - Okay.
stupid junkie bitch.
you got one more day out of Laroy, that's it.
niners are expecting a huge heroin shipment.
the carbines are for protection.
what happens if those Mayans crash that dope party with the Laroy's M-4s?
we lose all the Niner business, buy ourselves a huge black...
that ain't gonna happen.
these Mexi-assholes come into our territory, they steal from us, they shit on our livelihood.
I don't care who we got to grease or kill,
I want those goddamned guns back.
me and Chibs will pull together all our current intel on the Mayans.
juice, start hacking into crime databases.
get addresses on any Mayans in the system.
wherever you find those guns, Bobby,
I want to Fat Man and Little Boy every inch of that goddamn place.
Bobby's got Tahoe this weekend.
no, I'm canceling that shit. - I should be able to decide...
you got two ex-wives who already spent the goddamned casino checks.
last thing we need is PIs and lawyers camping out front.
and whose gonna handle the pyro, I'm not there?
nobody blows up shit better than Opie.
Opie's leaning right these days. - Opie's gonna lean any way we need him to.
you get him on board.
so you're sure you're okay with me stepping away from this?
Yeah, yeah, take the prospect with you.
I'll get him half-laid.
what is that smell?
I tried calling you. - What is it?
I found these matches next to a bunch of her empty thumb bags.
hairy Dog. - Shit.
got to be the Nords, dealing out the Dog again.
Darby got out of Chino two weeks ago.
well, call that Nazi prick, set a meeting.
what the hell happened? - When was the last time you saw her?
couple of weeks.
her hands and feet were full of tracks.
toxicology reports aren't back yet, but most likely crank.
the baby.
we had to do an emergency C-section.
he's ten weeks premature.
holy shit.
come on, let's sit down and I'll walk you through it.
just tell me.
he's got a congenital heart defect and gastroschis... a tear in his abdomen.
the gastro and the early birth are from the drugs, but the CHD is probably...
the family flaw. - Yes, it's genetic.
either one would be serious, but not life-threatening.
however, the two of them together...
Dr. Namid gives him a 20 percent chance, and I'm afraid that's being optimistic.
she never wanted to talk to me. I didn't know.
her OB said she missed her last three appointments. No one knew.
Dr. Namid wants to fix his belly first, then, if he stabilizes, he'll go in and try to repair the heart.
I'm sorry, Jax.
I can take you to see him now.
you don't have to do this.
I'm sure you got other patients. - I asked Dr. Namid if I could assist.
I want to help your son.
his name's Abel.
that's a good name.
Jackson... - Go with Tara.
I got something to do.
watch his back.
sell crank to my pregnant ex-wife.
easy, boys.
Hey, brother!
I think you made your point.
enjoy your lunch.
Shish-ka-balls are on me.
you okay? - Yeah.
I'm gonna go find Ope.
so everybody's saying it was a gun factory that blew up out by the streams last night.
Mayans hit us.
stole our M-4s.
we need you. - For what?
Bobby's got a gig this weekend.
no way, man. - We got to get in and out fast.
you're the guy who can pull it off.
you think I want to be here chipping wood for shit pay?
I made a promise to Donna. I'm earning straight.
come on, Ope. We all earn straight.
I spend 40 hours a week with a goddamn power tool in my hand.
when you're on Clay's payroll, everything in your hand is a power tool.
you're saying "no" to the club?
everything turned to shit since I got out.
I'm in debt up to my eyeballs.
my kids hardly know me.
I even mention Sam Crow to Donna, she's gonna bust out crying.
look, man, if you need money...
I don't want to borrow, I want to earn.
family's just got to adjust to you being around again.
kids got to get used to how ugly their dad is.
Donna knows what the life is.
you leave a woman alone for five years, two kids, the only thing that she knows is that she doesn't want it to happen again.
break's over, let's go!
let me know when you need me.
what's the, uh, Nord's roster looking like these days?
15, 16 guys, a few new kids breaking in.
same extreme hate shit.
still got meth labs outside of Lodi, selling mostly to truckers, some of the Mexi gangs.
you think they're stepping up?
only two things feel good in the joint, that's jerking off and thinking about all the shit you're gonna do when you get out.
Darby's been in there for three years.
I just want to make sure all his big-shot dreams ended up in his cum rag, and not on his to-do list.
how's his guy doing?
fractured cheek, broken nose...
left nut swinging solo. - Yes, it was beautiful!
Yeah, he's lucky to be breathing.
any luck up north?
Tacoma could help with the Glocks, but there's no M-4s anywhere.
washington state, Oregon, Nevada, nobody's got stock, man.
we'll have all the Mayan intel by the morning.
we'll get our guns back.
Treasury?
all the bills are paid, bar's stocked.
run fund is covered for the next two months.
Tig's the only man who owes me dues.
I'm a little short. Catch you next week.
guess those little Thai boys are getting expensive.
Yeah, they are.
all right, all right.
anything else? - Yeah, I...
I just want to say to Jackson, on a club level, the Sons of Anarchy, the Redwood Original, is here for you.
your father'd be proud of the man you've become, you know.
every time I see you sitting at this table,
I do a double take.
that's probably just the weed, Pop.
probably. I bet it is, yeah.
whatever you need, son, - it's yours. - Thank you, Piney.
Thanks, boys.
meeting closed.
here you go, Clay. - Thanks, kid.
Bobby? - Yeah?
what the hell is that smell?
I smell it, too.
it's that box.
what is it? - I don't know.
goddamn...
Oh! Geez! - That's mine.
you out of your goddamn mind?
no, I just... you know, I thought, it was like a surprise.
we could mount it in the club, you know, like, on the wall.
it's go to stuffed and treated, you idiot.
stuffed with what?
did Rosen track down any real estate for the rebuild?
ten acres for sale up north of 84.
you know, the stretch industry, paint factories, container yards...
kick his ass!
trucking in supplies will look like regular business.
What'd happen if we didn't rebuild?
what do you mean?
take the land profit, put it in something else.
I'm just thinking about what's best long-term.
we got heat with the Mayans.
ATF crawling up our ass.
might be time to look at other ways to earn.
Yeah, well, there's a lot of shit up in the air right now.
we'll figure out what the next move is.
Bobby, break that shit up.
hug it out.
you doing okay?
your mom says you haven't been back to the hospital.
don't worry about this Mayan shit. You need to focus on your family.
come on, man, don't push me out of this.
I know you're all spun out over Wendy and the kid.
understandable; it's awful shit.
but your father and I, we worked hard to create this business.
we served time.
we lost brothers. We spilled lot of blood.
and you're gonna need this now, more than ever.
a sick kid, it's an expensive burden.
you want to do the right thing by your family.
don't you?
Yeah.
of course.
well, then, go see your son.
I didn't think you'd want to see me.
everyone hates me.
I'm sorry, Jax. I'm so sorry.
please don't hate me.
you need to get help, Wendy. - I know, I know.
I will, I promise. This time, I promise.
the doctor said Abel's getting stronger.
they said maybe they would fix his belly tomorrow, maybe tomorrow morning.
they'll do everything they can.
my lawyer said they might file criminal charges.
fetal abuse.
I got some stuff back at the house in the stash drawer.
Jesus Christ.
it's just if they find that shit, they're gonna put me away.
you own the house, Jax.
I hate to see this blow back on you.
Yeah. Of course.
jax, wait. Please, please, Jax.
it's almost midnight.
this place is a goddamn pig sty.
clean was never her strong suit.
what are you doing here? - It's my house.
you know what I mean. I don't want you to see it this way.
mom, you don't have to do this. - I just want to get it livable.
buy you some decent carpet.
cigarette burns everywhere. - Mom...
get you outta that dorm room. Back home.
with your son. - Mom, for Christ's sake, stop cleaning!
he's not gonna make it.
what are you talking about? What happened?
he was born with half a stomach and a hole in his heart. He's gonna die.
don't you say that.
you are the only one this boy's got.
you don't believe he's gonna live, you might go down there and kill him yourself.
I'm sorry.
you gotta go see him, Jax.
I can't.
Why?
he'll break your heart.
it's called being a father. - For how long?
a day?
a week?
you know...
you were born with that same heart defect your little brother had.
you seem pretty sturdy to me.
I came through hell.
landed on my feet.
your father was hit by a goddamn semi.
dragged 178 yards.
and that bastard lived for two more days.
tellers do not die easy.
that's the Irish in us.
when you and Dad hooked up...
he ever talk to you about his vision?
about what he wanted from the club?
his vision was...
what it is.
a brotherhood.
family.
and running guns?
he want that?
found a box of his old shit in the storage unit.
just like pictures and journals.
things I never knew about him.
what kind of things?
seems like his original idea for the MC was something simpler.
you know, social rebellion.
he called it a Harley commune.
it wasn't outlaw, it was real hippie shit.
we had a lot of bright ideas back then. We were kids.
your father became a man.
men take care of business.
Yeah, we do.
you should get home, Mom.
finish cleaning tomorrow. I'll lock up.
okay, darling.
good night, Mom.
good night, baby.
how are the hands, baby?
it's just the damp.
where you been?
cleaning up at Jax's.
all this stuff with Abel's pushing some old buttons, huh?
it's not my buttons I'm worried about.
JAX is going through some shit.
not just with the kid.
what do you mean?
he found a box of John's stuff in storage.
he was asking me about his original vision for the club.
did he want to get into running guns.
tonight he said that maybe we shouldn't rebuild the factory.
shit.
he's getting chewed up by that guilt.
remorse is a dangerous thing.
look what Tommy's death did to John.
changed him.
made him soft.
you've gotta nail Jax down.
you have to nail him down hard, Clay.
whatever it takes.
I don't want the ghost of John Teller poisoning him, - ruining everything we've built. - Nothing is gonna get ruined, okay?
just don't throw your panic into high gear.
they respect him.
JAX is strong, and when you step down as...
I'm not going anywhere.
I know, baby.
I know.
it's just...
when you can't ride anymore...
they'll vote my son in as president.
I just want to make sure he's following in the right father's footsteps.
a little get-well present for your guy, Darby.
that's some serious iron. Izzy'll like that. Thank you.
figured we'd give him something that had some balls.
I know what it's like running a crew. Sometimes your guys do shit...
without thinking things through.
my guys are thinking just fine.
they thinking fine when they sold crank to my pregnant ex?
that was unfortunate.
how's your little family doing, anyway?
all right, all right, everybody contain your shit.
get off!
you done? - Yeah.
sorry, folks.
go back to your corndogs.
won't happen again.
I made sure the brotherhood had Opie's back every minute he was in Chino, and you know that.
Oh, I know how it works inside, Darby.
question is: do you remember how it works outside?
a lot changes in three years. - A lot stays the same.
nothing happens in Charming we don't control, or get a piece of.
if we wanted a meth trade, we'd have one.
we don't. - You know the drill.
I mean, you can cook all the crank you want along the border, but you do not deal in Charming.
we ain't the only cook shop in town.
I'm coming after you.
and next time I'm not going to use a 357.
as a get-well present.
there's no need to be making threats, brother.
me and my boys have always managed to make things work with Sam Crow.
good.
milk and cookies are on us.
Abel's stomach surgery went well, but it's putting a strain on his system.
Dr. Namid doesn't want to wait. We should do the heart surgery now.
that's good, right? That they're not waiting?
it's the best choice, yes.
Thanks.
can we talk?
what is it?
Wendy's in really bad shape.
she's still detoxing.
can't stop crying.
I was hoping maybe you could talk to her.
just let her know she's not all alone.
nothing I'm going to say to that crank whore is going to make her feel loved.
forgot just how forthright you can be.
you forgot a lot of things, sweetheart.
if you have a problem with me assisting on Abel's case, - just say so. - You a good doctor?
then I don't have a problem. - Good.
people change.
I'm not the same girl I was ten years ago.
I am.
guess there's some things you can't change.
I leave it there so I remember all that shit's behind me.
forgot just how clever you can be.
Mayans got two shops where they cut and bag the heroin.
20 minutes outside of Oakland here.
Marcus Alvarez, president of the Oakland Charter, owns both buildings where they run their dope operations.
local cops are on a payroll, so it's a no-hassle gig.
which makes them lazy.
Alvarez don't try too hard to cover his tracks.
he also knows that we'd be onto the cut shops.
we wouldn't take a chance housing the M-4's there.
stores them someplace off the grid.
backtracked one of Alvarez's dummy corporations in San Leandro, along the U-Pac rail line, here.
Marcalva Industrial Storage.
good work, kids.
what are you doing?
got to make a run.
what's in the bag? - Nothing.
you promised you were done with this. - It's got nothing to do with you.
I'm the one who gets shit on if you get caught again.
it's not going to happen. - You sat in a cell for 5 years while Clay and the others got rich. They sold you out.
you know that.
you're just too weak to stand up to them.
give me the bag. - No!
give me the bag! - No! No! No!
stop it.
come on. Let's go inside.
didn't hear you pull up.
parked down the block.
didn't want to tweak Donna.
you catch all that? - Enough.
I think she's already tweaked.
stay here. I'll handle the run.
I don't show up, Clay will chop off both our dicks.
as soon as I leave, take your kid to the E. R.
tell them she hit her head. Just get a record of being there.
I'll cover you with Sam Crow.
what about the boom?
I watched you do it before.
I'll call you on the prepay if I need help.
you sure about this? - Go fix your family.
why didn't you tell me about your kid?
I didn't know what to say.
Where's Ope? - Kid got hurt.
had to take her to the hospital.
got the bag. I can make it work.
it's all good, brother.
how does that sound? - That was good.
Bobby, Jesus, what are you doing here?
Simon, what the hell is that? - I'm booked.
tonight, tomorrow, five shows.
I got a new girl in booking.
dumb bitch doubled up my acts.
just tell Chun King to take a hike.
I got six busloads of Korean tourists coming in.
they love Asian Elvis.
I'll get you next month, Bobby.
who is it?
the Colonel.
praise Jesus, it's a miracle.
I've got the rest over here.
get the guns in the van.
wire this shithole up.
what the hell is the problem? - Nothing.
just got to check something with Ope.
guns are loaded.
what's the holdup?
we got company.
got to be the Mayans. - Yeah.
get the van out of sight. Lay low.
you... with me.
open it.
check the electric panel.
should have been long gone by now.
we got the iron. Let's get the hell out of here.
I came to send a message.
those two wetbacks see that busted back door, they'll call for backup.
blowing up shit's one thing.
we off these guys, could trigger something runs out of control.
that's the cost of your mistake.
I'll draw 'em to the dumpster.
tell your dirtbag buddies, they camp out here, they get some of this.
you tell your dirtbag buddies, they steal from Sam Crow, they get some of this.
go check the back.
make sure that's all of them.
he's all yours.
bp's dropping.
get the paddles. - Charging.
keep clear.
check the leads.
prepare to massage the heart.
I'm all right.
got the vest.
finish it.
it's finished.
I leave you bad boys for two minutes, and it all turns to shit!
we're all good.
let's get out of here. - Clay.
look at this.
Darby's guy.
looks like Darby did make some new friends in Chino.
white boy must've sucked lots of brown dick.
Nords crew up with the Mayans,
and a common enemy: us.
Darby wants Charming.
there goes the neighborhood.
sinus rhythm's back.
O2 sats are coming up.
candle's in the cake.
looks like the boy might actually see his first birthday.
he made it?
we should say a little prayer.
okay. That'd be good.
dear God, thank you for saving this boy...
from his murderous junkie mom, who cared more about a $40 rush than she did her own flesh and blood.
don't you dare... - Don't I dare?
you pathetic whore.
guess the D. A. was impressed with your Bible studies.
hear they're not gonna press charges.
when I check out of here, I'm going into Promises.
let's just throw money at those 12-step freaks.
how long is it gonna last this time?
six months?
three? Couple of weeks?
it's gonna be different this time. This time I have my baby to live for.
that's where you're wrong.
you have no baby.
you lost that privilege.
you so much as cast a shadow on that kid, try to turn some legal screw and get custody...
I will finish this job.
he will never...
call you Mommy.
I suggest you turn to Jesus.
is he gonna be okay?
it looks good.
clean yourself up, Jax.
John! Need a hand! Somebody's pinned!
come here!
I'm gonna check the legs.
he's clear? - Yeah.
clear? - Yeah.
get him. Okay, the back-- push it down; we're gonna lift up.
Yup. - All right.
okay? On three. - Ready.
one. Two. Three. - Good job.
we got a double.
who's on it? - Me. I'm up.
good. You can take the new guy with you.
new guy?
ray's in court for one day and you stick me with somebody else?
I like Ray. We click.
trust me.
you'll like this one, too.
Russ, you're out of the hospital.
Yeah. A week ago.
a week? It's been a week since I've talked to you?
Mm-hmm.
he's on light duty.
so, don't go chasing after any criminals.
surprised?
Yeah. Dina let you out of the house?
Yeah. She's in New York, meeting with publishers.
publishers? - Yeah. She's trying to sell her blog.
I heart a Cop.
gonna make it into a book.
but there's not a lot of love between the two of us these days.
so, that means it'll be a work of fiction.
Yeah. Exactly.
"I like Ray. We click"?
the ones I've been getting aren't working anymore, Laurie.
your dealer is not selling you placebos, John.
Yeah. You know him?
you're building up a tolerance, okay?
even if I gave you something stronger, you'll eventually build a tolerance to that, too.
you are in pain for a reason.
you've got to start listening to your body or you are going to wind up in a wheelchair.
you know, I don't know a lot of married couples that can still stand each other after a divorce.
Yeah.
I still think of you as family.
what?
you have cancer or something?
I'm turning 40 next week.
and I'm thinking about having a kid.
that's good.
a kid. Uh...
who with?
I'm checking out options, okay?
adoption.
and, um, a sperm donor.
Hey, hey. I wouldn't laugh.
I used to think that we were going to have a child together once.
you asking to have a kid with me?
will you at least think about it?
Yeah.
I'll think about it.
thank you.
other end of a black man's gun, you're either gonna get shot or robbed.
and one of these six-toed, banjo-playing peckerwoods points a gun at you, you're going to the desert in a cooler.
probably make a belt buckle out of your nipples.
well, you gotta admire their leather-working skills, huh?
so, did you, uh... did you get that reservation?
I did. Thank you. - Sure.
what, you taking Captain Sue out tonight?
Yep, going to finally celebrate her promotion.
look at this guy. Married to the bars and stars.
let me ask you something. Does she sign your overtime slips?
cause that would be convenient. - Ha, ha, funny guy.
does she, uh-- does she like to clean your gun?
Ooh, that's...
shut up! - Excuse me, ladies.
Hey, hey, hey, Andy. - Sorry, it's early.
I haven't had any coffee. - Hey, how's it going?
I'm doing a story on the Canyon Rapist.
three rapes in one month.
Yeah, scumbag. Impersonating a cop.
city's in a panic. Do you care to comment?
I think I just did.
I want to see you, Sal. - Yeah, yeah.
I want to see you, too.
all right, listen up.
we're at max deployment. Everyone knows why.
the Canyon Rapist.
there will be no days off.
all Vice, SPU and nonessential detective personnel will roll with us until further notice.
this guy's hit our division three times in the last month.
I take that personally.
I know you do, too.
all right, now that you got your car assignments,I'm gonna turn it over to Detective Roberts with Sex Crimes.
the guy we're looking for is a male Caucasian.
Six-foot-two. Hundred ninety pounds.
brown hair.
blue eyes. Approximate age, 40.
his uniform is like ours.
his badge is a shield.
this department's had to overcome a lot these past 20 years.
there are people out there who will think this is another dirty cop.
we can't allow that to happen.
the sooner we catch this guy, the sooner we can all go back to normal.
Max deployment is not the way to go for this.
care to tell me why?
sure.
the rapist is used to seeing one or two black-and-whites on the street.
now he sees ten to twenty.
maybe that's the idea.
it'll push him out of our area.
force him into hiding.
five times the amount of boots on the street.
just makes it that much more likely we're gonna catch him.
Yeah. Well, you're wrong.
last guy that dressed like a cop and raped women got caught because of a lone cop with world-class instincts who froze his balls off in an alley for two nights.
trust me, when this guy gets caught it's gonna be because of a street cop.
maximum deployment.
nothing but a hand job for the press.
John, John, up on the left.
I locked my keys in my car.
what would you like us to do about that, ma'am?
can't you just use your master key? - Ooh, the "master key."
that magically unlocks everything.
every door in the whole city.
John, there's a rapist on the street.
pop the trunk.
have a nice day.
the home of Jack and Linda Durand.
well liked in the neighborhood.
back window was pulled off.
kid tried to call 911, and wasn't able to get a line out.
phone is dead.
which is consistent with the grandson's story.
how old's the kid? - Four.
Where's little boy now?
down the street at his preschool.
ran to the nearest place he can recognize.
school administrator's called it in.
you want me to bring him here? - No. We'll go to him.
could you get a photograph of this?
is that a homemade silencer? - Yeah.
jewelry's gone.
Yeah, no pro would turn a simple home invasion into a double homicide.
Jack was shot first.
silencer blew off and hit the headboard.
forgot that you did that.
call the murder victims by their first name.
Linda must've heard the shot and woke up.
you got a time of death?
lividity puts it between midnight and 2: 00.
come look at these defensive wounds.
um, who knows what the grandson saw?
I'll go to the preschool. I'll find out.
the car needs repair work sooner or later.
go ask some questions.
Yeah.
stay here.
hope you've given some thought about the conversation we had a few weeks ago.
what?
communications Division.
I've never worked a desk in my life.
you want me to start out all over again on the bottom?
how's that any different than what you're doing right now?
what is your problem?
look, I know this sucks, all right.
but people don't always get better with practice.
you're not a street cop anymore.
because I disagreed with you? - No.
not because you disagreed with me.
it's cause the way you see things. The way you carry yourself.
I don't know, maybe it's because you worked with - Dewey for so long. - The way I carry myself?!
they haven't worked on any black Crown Vics.
good, let's keep moving.
I don't, I don't know that much about pearls. So, how do I know?
natural pearls, the best. Only from the Red Sea.
yeah?
how much?
40 to 70% off. You help after robbery, Sal.
wholesale for you.
all right, I'll take this one here. - Classic.
she will have for the rest of her life.
good choice, my friend. - Yeah, let's hope.
um, I'll be right with you, all right?
Hey, what's up?
I'm at a press conference.
your wife is here.
she's prettier than I expected.
Hey, you didn't talk to her, did you?
no.
God, Sal, what kind of person do you think I am?
the mayor's here.
he says he watches me every night.
Yeah, I'll bet he does.
no, he was really nice.
he actually invited us to a party at his house tonight.
are you crazy? Us?
that's not gonna happen.
well, he invited me.
but I'd love to have you there.
Yeah, I can't. I got plans.
with the family?
uh, yeah.
Hey, listen, I gotta go, all right?
all right.
he's my child. I want to take him home.
is this how you treat your parents of your children?
is this what you do?! - Detective Clarke.
is that a detective? Detective, I need to speak with you now!
stop, stop.
I'll be out in a few minutes. Have a seat.
and they look around. - So, Michael, this is where your granny and grandpa sleep, right?
Where's your room?
show me with this guy. Where's your room?
show me there.
is this your room?
cool.
is this where you were when you heard the boom?
Uh-oh, close your eyes. The green dragon is coming.
green dragon?
the one that made grammy melt.
she walked right down from the hill and...
who did this to you? - Fell down the street.
he was a cop.
A43 Code 6. Just occurred at our location.
you're safe now. - Suspect being described as a police officer.
Where's Max?
Max? - Where's my baby?
ma'am, you had a baby with you?
Where's your baby?
we're gonna follow you to the hospital.
we won't leave until you're joined by a counselor, okay?
you understand?
okay.
is he okay?
A43, advise all units, we found the child.
A43, copy that.
it didn't seem real, you know?
I'd seen something about it on the news.
I almost didn't stop the car.
but then I saw the police lights.
he had a uniform and everything.
is he a police officer?
no, ma'am.
he wasn't.
take this. It's for your shoulder.
Hey, Kathleen.
How've you been?
I'm good. How are you?
I almost didn't recognize you. - Yeah.
uh, it's been a while.
Oh, excuse me, my sister... - Yeah, hi.
my sister-in-law, Misty, is here.
Oh, okay, have a seat. - Okay.
Michael! Oh, hey, kiddo! - Oh! Hey!
how you doing? - I'm good.
Oh, good, everything okay?
Where's Michael?
I don't want him going to one of my sisters. He's mine.
why can't I have him?
child Protective Services has him.
it's up to them where he goes for the time being.
if you love him so much, why did your mother have custody of him?
she was keeping him for me for a while.
how long have you been doing meth?
I'm not gonna lie to you. I own a 12-gauge.
you got priors. You got domestics.
I called the sheriff's station out in Palmdale.
and they say that they're out at your place twice a week.
misty, man. She's kind of a force of nature.
would you blame a tsunami for being a tsunami?
uh, where were you last night between midnight and 2: 00 am?
uh, driving in Arizona.
what were you doing in Arizona?
I was delivering cold rolled steel for the industry supply house I work for.
McManus-Starr.
okay.
we're going to have to test that shotgun.
you know, I, uh,
I hurt my leg once poppin' wheelies a few years ago.
I never been the same since.
so excited to see you.
High-five, buddy.
thank you. - Mm-hmm.
I hope she burns in hell for what she did to our parents.
the jewelry was missing.
meth addicts rob their families all the time.
no.
well, you said it yourself, you and Dennis got high.
maybe the two of you got carried away. - No!
what were you wearing?
what? - Your clothes.
your son saw the killer.
Oh... oh, God!
Oh, God!
I'm serious, Chloe.
just promise me that if a cop pulls you over you're gonna keep driving till you get to a public area.
Yeah, yeah, I already called Mom and Olivia.
I'm calling you last because you're more stubborn than them.
just, just don't be stupid.
all right, I'm your big brother. I love you.
Bye.
how long are we gonna have to hang around here before we get back on the street?
we're just waiting on the rape crisis counselor.
they should be here in the next few hours.
you really want to get this guy.
Yeah.
my mom was raped.
because they're Nazis and my life is Auschwitz, that's why.
it is a nightmare most women can't imagine.
a man pulling them over... - Dad!
in broad daylight... - Dad! Dad!
what?
What?!
can I sleep over Melissa's house tonight?
that's why you're yelling?
I said no.
just like the last 12 times you asked me.
you know the rules. I have to meet Melissa first.
Yeah.
look, there's your girlfriend.
what is it?
well, can I?
Yeah.
sweet. He says I can go.
wait a minute. I thought we said no.
I changed my mind.
Oh, she was at the press conference today.
the serial rapist may be stalking his next victim.
yeah?
we gotta get going. Come on.
Hey, can you, uh, do me a favor, Kath?
look, I hate to ask, but, uh, I hurt my back early in the shift and...
I have some Motrin. - Yeah, I took some already.
it's still killing me.
here's a sample pack. - Great.
does the trick for my migraines. - Cool.
it's good to see you.
and the plaster cast?
I see.
Yeah, I'll hold.
Hey, I had to kick Dennis loose. He had a rock-solid alibi.
well, Misty's going downtown.
if she knows anything, she'll roll.
you're so good, it's bad.
Allergy-free?
okay.

you promised me that you wouldn't let anything fall between the cracks.
you're the one who said she could go. - Oh...
no, we made a deal. - Dad, don't yell at her.

you resent me for going back to work.
that's a nice little bait and-switch you pulled, Susan.

they'd believe in a higher power and sanity could be restored.
step number two, my friends.
all right. Let's go.
you get that for me, please? - Yes.
Hey, boot, Sally ever ask you to wear your hat?
huh? I used to keep my spare set of blues in her closet, man.
she's a freak!
first body we caught was Frosty, of the westside ridaz.
originally we thought it was typical beef over drug territory.
turns out it was over a girl.
frosty was banging Leti Vargas,
first cousin of Huan Vargas, street name nobody, Of the latin hustlaz.
so nobody shot Frosty, but who shot nobody?
cams picked up a silver escalade Leaving the scene of the drive-By.
david Marcus has the car,
and the profile fits the description.
might have the car but doesn't fit the profile.
just got back from s. I.D. No gsr marks on his hand, no gun.
this kid David Marcus is literally a choir boy.
he plays the drums at second a. M.E.
and this truck- Paid for perfect credit,
manager of a video-game store in the Fox hills mall. No tats.
he doesn't even have any parking tickets.
diamond earrings, baggy jeans,
drove a tricked-out s. U.V. Blasting Glasses Malone.
so? This guy could be an innocent civilian.
or he's just another asshole we haven't caught yet.
either way, look the part, pay the price.
Oh, come on, man. If - If dude was driving a prius,
bumping John Mayer, he'd be alive right now.
you know it.
you see?
that's Tony in front of his Escalade,
Rodrigo, next to Eddie, my baby.
they all have shaved heads, earrings, baggy jeans.
they love hip-Hop.
Tony's a captain in afghanistan, Rodrigo just became a p2 in southeast,
at eddie's at Berkeley,
and you're gonna tell me that my boys deserve to get shot up
just because they wear baggy jeans and love hip-hop?
I bet you if they were white
and ththey lived next door to you in Santa Clarita
Castaic- I live in castaic. And don't throw that tired "white boy doesn't understand the neighborhood" bullshit at me.
don't do it. Where do you live?
so much crime out in the Flint.
bodies just stacking up.
tonight we're at the site a joyous celebration
instead, it's a crime scene, with the gunman still at large
and two innocent victims left in his wake.
a young mother and her 4-year-old son lie dead,
the fourth and fifth victims of an mlk weekend full of violence,
in sharp contrast With martin luther king's message of nonviolence.
detective Salinger.
is this shooting related to the other ones?
no comment.
is it racially motivated?
Hey, what do we got?
Lydia and I are checking traffic cams to see if we get lucky and catch a plate.
we're looking for a dark blue chevy suburban.
all right. Hang in there.
the father of the baby is a Latin hustla.
did he get a good look at the shooter?
Nope.
dark, chevy suburban, maybe.
shooter was black.
the gun? - ak- 47, based on the shell casings.
S.I.D. is running the ballistics now.
geez. An ak?
wasn't even a bullet fragment that killed the kid.
it was shrapnel from the car door.
there's a lot of guys coming up from Mexico.
ak is easy money on the street.
hardware that heavy, it's got to be a neighborhood gun.
they pass it around the gang from crime to crime.
well, good.
if it's been used before, maybe we'll catch a break.
listen, find me a good wit, all right?
there's no way we find a casing this far from the house.
well, you never know.
Hey, this one time, when i was a boot,
this drunk lost his glass eye in the middle of the street.
my partner and I had to look for it.
just about the time I'm gonna give up
and go ask my t.o. If I could punch out,
Kkkt!- I stepped right on that bitch.
Oh.
what was the kid's name?
the hell would you want that in your head for?
believe me, god did us a favor.
this neighborhood, two gangster parents
we'd be right back here in eight years,
arresting that little Vato's ass,
damn sure be zipping him up in a bigger body bag.
the universe saved us a trip.
what did you say?
Hey, I'm just trying to keep it real, baby girl.
keep it real, baby girl"?
man, that's somebody's kid.
Yeah. Two gangsters.
you see any bona fide humans around here?
????
get back in your tuna boat, bitch!
bitch? I'll show you a bitch! - hey, hey!
meet me in a parking lot- Knock it off! Knock it off!
God damn it, there's cameras everywhere! - Bitch.
shut him up. - Look at me. Look at me.
everybody get the hell out of here now.
get him out of here. - All right.
let get of me, man. Just let go of me. Let go.
get out of here, all of you.
I'll show you a bitch, bitch.
tuna boat, my ass.
are you kidding me, man?
are you freakin' kidding me?! Those stupid bitches.
John, I've never hit a woman in my life. I'm not a woman-beater, man.
but tonight i was this close to beating both those bitches down, man.
armed or unarmed. I don't give a shit!
the only piece of metal those bitches should be allowed to carry is a frying pan!
Jesus christ!
Oh, John, you know what? All i did was tell the truth, bro.
that is it, man. I told the truth.
you know as well as i do
we should bus every one of those dirty gangsters down to the coliseum, throw in some guns and ammo,
lock the door, and let god sort it out.
let's get some more coffee.
Yes, let's get some coffee.
stupid bitches. Get in your tuna boat and get out of my face.
Oh, great.
you want your coffee black, right?
Yep. - Not a word, boot.
let's roll.
what?
come on.
son of a bitch!
we got at least five different cases
where an ak was used in the last three months.
all near ridaz territory.
wouldn't they just toss the gun?
toss an ak? No way, man.
it's too hard to replace. It's golden.
4 years old.
remember the name.
remember the face.
he's a reminder as to why we drag our sorry asses out of bed every morning
in the service of a city who just doesn't give a damn.
fighting gang crime is like punching water.
no matter how hard you hit, you just can't seem to leave a dent.
but when a baby is murdered, it makes you remember
what it felt like the first time you put your blues on
and stood in front of a mirror.
it makes you remember why you became a cop.
the mission's clear.
punish evil everywhere.
there are hardworking, decent folks that live in these communities.
certain lines just cannot be crossed.
there's only one way to send that message sometimes.
so we're gonna send our boots so far up these gangsters' asses,
they won't even dream about pulling this bullshit again.
God damn it, i want the gun.
I want the killer.
I want them both- Pronto.
you know what we're looking for, right?
you guys don't know?
we're looking for an ak-47. You guys know where that is?
nobody knows?
what about you?
get your hands up!
hands up!
hands up! Hands up right now!
Hey, man. Y'all got a warrant, man? What the hell's going on, man?
Hey, man, that's medicinal right there, man!
I want names, location, gun,
right now, or I take you in.
three strikes, you're out.
see, baby? That's why you never trust the police, man!
Where's the ak?
huh?
Where's the gun?!
give me the other hand. Give me the other hand.
tell us where the shit is.
come on, boys. You want to go home, you want to go to jail?
we won't put your name anywhere near this.
just tell us where the gun's at.
take him.
go!
back door! Kitchen, kitchen, kitchen, kitchen!
he's running!
pigs can't catch me.
hey there, dirty.
???? - Can I get you a chair?
moretta! - Pull up, man.
we got it. It was under the couch.
ak-47 with your sheet
man, you ain't ever coming out.
pull your leg under.
you killed a hustla baby.
I know a couple vatos in folsom That would love to holler at you.
man, I ain't kill that kid, man.
on god, one of the homies just dropped that gun off, man.
give us a name.
a name, asshole.
G-Ron, man.
man, look, G-Ron killed that kid, man. I swear to god that's all I know.
how did dewey get so screwed up?
was he always like that?
no. He was passionate and focused, like you.
the job doesn't make you something.
it just brings out who you already are.
you can't tell me dead babies don't bother you anymore.
you got to learn when to turn off The camera inside your head.
how do you do that?
well, when you learn how to do that, You're ready to be a training officer.
see the suburban? - Yeah.
light 'em up on my signal.
A43, show us in pursuit of a dark blue chevy suburban,
license plate three-Adam-Baker four-Five-Seven-David.
heading east on Van Ness, just passing Slauson.
Ow! Shit!
get up. - I am.
get up! What's your name?
what's your street name?! - You got these on too tight.
your street name!
what? Let's take a trip, G-Ron.
lay off, man.
so, how does a good guy like David Marcus
end up with an asshole best friend like you?
was he in the streets?
hell naw. His pops would have whupped his ass.
but y'all hung anyway?
since markham elementary.
but he didn't end up a rida.
did all your friends end up as cops?
you got choices. But your peoples are your peoples.
he ever let you borrow the car?
three weeks ago.
bunch of us took some cluck-clucks down to the cheesecake factory in Glendale.
frosty's girl- She was there.
your friend is dead because you borrowed his car.
they knew the car. They thought they had you.
but instead it was david who was shot.
that's not my fault.
I never did no dirt around him.
david had dreams, a wife, kid.
he ain't deserve to go out like that.
so you shoot up a birthday party
out of loyalty to a man with a wife, a kid,
a man that was churchgoing?
he wasn't even banging.
you killed a baby, asshole.
if I could do it again, I'd use a mac-10 next time,
make sure I take even more of them out.
em.
em all and anybody who's down with them.
you don't have a Sally story?
no.
my car is parked at her place.
and I could really use a massage after I tackled that dude.
you're a glutton for punishment.
you guys are just jealous. - Yeah.
you have been warned, my friend.
you have been warned.
what can i say?
love's a bitch, ese.
see you tomorrow!
can i help you with something?
Yeah. I'm victor cifuentes. - Yeah?
we met a couple of months ago at the open house.
yeah? - I'm tammi's photography instructor.
what's going on?
listen, I don't know how else, you know, I'm gonna say it,
so i'm just gonna say it.
I'm in love with your wife.
we need to be adult about this, figure it out,
and do what's in the best interests of the baby.
that's all I wanted to say.
I'm sorry, Sammy.
Aah!
Southland cops know when the Santa Ana winds blow,
you learn just how close you are to the edge.
??????
Aw. - Ohh.
Santa anas are blowing out my 'do.
I had to run halfway down the street to get my recycling bin.
I don't get it. It used to be just three months out of the year the winds blew.
now it's like fire season all year round.
the westside rapist hit another victim.
damn.
are you experiencing any relief from your symptoms?
no.
not really.
well, if it's not helping by now, It's probably not muscular.
your insurance only covers 12 sessions.
how many have I had?
it could be degenerative.
it could be a ruptured disc.
it may be time for you to look into other options.
have you thought about surgery?
look, it's your back.
if it was my back, I'd want to at least consult with a surgeon,
see what they say.
Hey.
every woman's worst nightmare.
Munoz, what do we got?
husband came home early from a business trip...
Mm.
...found his wife roughed up and pretty hysterical.
any signs of forced entry?
Yeah, we got that torn window screen. That's all we got.
hmm. Witnesses?
middle of the night-- Maid wasn't working.
so, did you talk to the victim?
no. I tried, but she's pretty traumatized.
maybe you guys can talk to her.
Yeah, let's get a canvass going in the neighborhood, all right?
okay, okay. - Thanks.
????
Mrs. Wellington, I know this is difficult for you,
but we need to ask you a couple of questions.
I'm sure you think you don't have the strength to do this, but you do.
I don't.
you're gonna get through this.
I'll put you in touch with some people that I know
at the rape treatment center who can help you.
you know, this never would have happened If I wasn't traveling so much.
Oh, this isn't your fault.
it's nobody's fault.
look, I know you don't think you can talk right now,
but we think that you could be this man's fourth victim.
and there are a lot of other women out there,
and I don't want to see the same thing to happen to them.
do you?
no.
then help us stop him.
it was dark.
I woke up, and he was on top of me.
did you see his face?
not very well.
it was dark.
what was he wearing?
some kind of uniform.
did it say anything, have a company name?
no, just the- the type janitors wear, people like that.
what color?
it was dark.
green.
blue. I...
did-- Did he say anything to you?
take your time.
he said if i didn't shut up, that he would kill me.
um, was there anything distinctive About his voice, um, an accent?
actually, yeah, an accent.
what kind?
Hispanic, I think. - Okay.
do you have an alarm?
was it on?
I turned it off.
the winds had flipped the alarm.
Mrs. Wellington, you did really good.
we just need you to do one more thing.
please go to the hospital and get checked out.
here's my card if you have any questions.
Santa anas are kicking up again.
we got hillsides burning in Calabasas, Sylmar, and Malibu.
Ohh, god forbid America's heroes have to get off their asses and do a little work.
if the winds don't change direction, we're looking at a possible tactical alert.
I said possible tactical alert.
that gang detective we lost from the Alvarado unit,
Nate Moretta-- His funeral's on sunday.
I want to see everyone there.
if anyone's interested in making a donation to the family,
an account has been set up through the police credit union.
keep his partner, Samuel Bryant, in your prayers.
that's it.
you all right? - Yeah, it's allergies.
I hate the santa anas. Makes people crazy.
a couple years ago, the city was burning on both ends.
domestics went through the roof.
you want me to drive?
do I want you to drive?
let's see -- The last shift,
you gave a death notification to the wrong person
and lost a handcuffed suspect.
until you can stop stepping all over your dick,
I'm driving, you're keeping books.
the exam shows evidence of trauma to the genitalia and inner thighs,
as well as other injuries consistent with rape.
sperm?
uh, no, she showered.
I'm-- I'm sorry.
Oh, no, no, don't apologize. Victims do it all the time.
thank you, doctor.
excuse me.
listen, uh...
what are the chances you catch this bastard?
well, we have detectives from two divisions working on the case.
we'll catch him.
I don't-- I don't want to testify.
what are you talking about? This guy's got to pay for what he did.
it doesn't change anything. It still happened.
look, you don't need to worry About testifying right now, okay?
just get some rest. We'll be in touch.
all right, thank you.
what?
look, I understand you're trying to build rapport with the victim,
but if we catch this guy, we got to get her to testify.
if she's saying she's not gonna testify now,
she's probably not gonna do it.
doesn't mean we can't encourage her.
she said she didn't see him.
we need to pursue other tracks of evidence
instead of just relying on her testimony.
well, she's traumatized.
as she calms down, she may remember more details.
Hey, the west valley detectives
that are handling the other two rapes-- They called back.
they got any leads?
they said that the other attacks happened Late afternoon, early morning,
and that the victims said the guy was hispanic,
smelled like sweat and dirt.
so they're following up with any day laborers,
gardeners that work in the-- You know, in the neighborhood that the rapist hit.
so they're gonna get us the list. - Good.
you think there might any workers in our neighborhood, too?
Whew. That would be a break.
Yeah.
Yeah, I got my gate pass and directions.
I'll see you tomorrow.
where you headed?
you know Salazar? Lives out in Calabasas.
he says he was up all night on his roof,
fighting a brush fire with a garden hose.
over here! - Ohh.
it's got my dog!
what does? - A snake! He's going to kill precious!
where is it?
in the backyard!
come on!
hurry. - All right.
it's under the porch.
huh?
right there.
where the hell did that come from?
my asshole neighbor. - I didn't do shit.
Wally was outside sunning, and the winds blew his cage open.
should we tase him?
it's a $5,000 snake.
it's killing my dog.
I'll give you the 50 bucks. Go to the shelter and buy another dog.
you!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, shut up.
you want me to call animal control?
no, it's gonna take too long. He's suffocating that thing.
all right, I'm going under.
I'll get the head. You get the dog.
I- I wouldn't do that. Wally's pretty hungry.
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna sit here while he eats it.
all right, wally.
no puppy today.
Unh!
you gonna help here?
Yeah, I'm gonna tase it.
get the snake.
such a good dog. - You may want to go give him a hand with that thing.
you know
Yeah.
all right. Thanks for calling back.
dog just got out of surgery
couple fractured ribs, but she's gonna be okay.
I wonder how much that's gonna cost the owner?
a few years ago, my mom spent 7 grand on chemo for our schnauzer.
what a waste.
can't put a price tag on man's best friend.
sure, you can.
I didn't know you were such an animal lover.
I like dogs, all right?
it's too dark to work.
I was working my other side job.
Where'd the scratches come from?
clearing the bougainvilleas.
when did that happen?
is that right?
am I gonna be arrested?
no.
of course.
he leave a note?
Nope.
poor bastard. Wonder why he hung himself.
it's "hanged.
what?
it's "hanged," not "hung.
really, genius?
google it, boot.
what?
hanged.
hanged versus hung...
Hanged" is correct.
told you, asshole.
hanged? - Yeah.
let me see that thing.
Jesus. - Oh.
I swear to god-- Only during the Santa Anas.
A43, 459 in progress, 317 sycamore street, apartment 7.
show you handling code 2.
A43, show us handling. - Yeah, I- I got this!
jerk-offs.
do we have to do this now? I- I don't feel safe here.
honey, the-- the sedatives are on their way over, okay?
I've taken care of that.
let's just hear what they have to say, all right?
we're very sorry to intrude, But we've got some photos
that we'd like you to look at.
I-- I don't think i'm ready for that.
if you identify the man who assaulted you,
he won't be able to hurt anyone else.
and if you don't see him in this round, it's okay.
we'll keep looking.
look, I know you want all of this to go away,
and if I were you, I'd want the same thing.
I've worked a lot of these cases,
and there's a very strong possibility That he may take a plea
and you may not even have to go to court.
please, we need you to look at the photos.
Ohh.
that's him.
uh, which one? Please point him out to me.
number 5.
that's- That's the guy, hon?
Yes, it's number 5.
Hey! Hey! Put down the pipe!
put down the pipe!
go ahead! Shoot me! I don't care!
come on, kid.
why'd you break in here?
I didn't! I live here!
don't lie to me.
my parents asked me to crash at a friend's house last night.
I got home this morning, and they had moved out!
your parents leave a note saying where they're going?
they left two things behind-- Me and the trash.
were you convinced by that i. D?
Oh, yeah. And when we get Sergio into custody,
we've got to get her to testify.
look, I want a clearance on this case as much as you do,
but she alone is not gonna convince a jury.
the d.A. Is not gonna file unless his DNA matches
what we found at the crime scene.
Yeah, but the west valley detectives already said
another victim i.D.'D him, so that's two out of four.
but it was a weak i.D.
it's still an i.D. man. And he's got two priors.
I mean, shoplifting and battery during a bar fight?
come on, once a criminal, always a criminal.
even with dna, I still don't think that we should push Katherine.
she's a mess-- Popping pills.
she's not going on that stand.
no, I care about the victims. I do.
but we're not counselors. Our job is to catch the rapists.
so that's why you made up that b.S. story about her not having to go to court.
you have no idea if he's gonna take a plea.
I've been doing this a while, okay?
creating a ruse to get a criminal to confess is one thing,
but to coerce a rape victim into i.D.'Ing somebody?
that's wicked.
Ugh. - Bless you.
Thanks.
thanks for the burger.
it was good.
you inhaled that thing.
it's been a couple of days since I've had anything to eat.
mom never cooked.
Mm- Hmm.
my parents were assholes, too.
I didn't know cops talked like that to kids.
well, what are you gonna do, arrest me?
what's gonna happen to me?
well...
we're gonna take you down to the station.
social worker will come by and put you with a new family.
what if they're whack?
they won't be.
trust me.
check out the roses. - Hmm.
what is this about?
we have a warrant for your arrest.
I didn't hurt that woman.
por favor, you have to believe me.
watch your head.
??? Vicinity of Griffith park, respond to the ranger station
to assist the fire department with evacuations.
hope they get these fires under control.
hate cleaning the ash out of my pool.
it clogs the filter. God, look at this asshole
driving by braille.
well, light them up.
A43, request wants and warrants For 49926.
how you doing?
did I do something wrong, officer?
license and registration, please.
sure.
you want to step out of the vehicle, please?
sorry. I got a bad knee. There's no odor of alcohol.
you want to explain to me why your eyes are dilated?
sir, step over here, please.
face the wall for me, please, sir.
xanax and oxycodone. - They're prescription.
I'm on the waiting list at kaiser For a knee replacement,
but it's gonna take six months.
cost me 30 grand if I pay out of pocket.
you're not supposed to be operating heavy machinery on these.
what makes you think you can drive?
I'm not an addict. I've got chronic pain.
I take just enough to get me through the day.
Yeah, just enough to maybe get into an accident,
get somebody killed?
all I did was take some pills my doctors prescribed. Is that a crime?
Yeah, as a matter of fact, it is, numb nuts.
you're under arrest-- Driving under the influence of drugs.
Ohh. - Turn around.
hands behind your back.
Ohh. - Let's go.
he's still waiting for the social worker?
Yeah. He's better off here. The system sucks.
what you got?
log from the alarm company.
there's no record of the alarm going off like Katherine told us.
Oh, she's been through a lot. She probably just got confused.
Sergio's out.
how the hell did he get out?
some rich lady he works for posted his bail
says he's a good man, thinks he's innocent.
Ohh, Katherine Wellington ain't gonna be happy.
come on. Let's go. - Come on. Let's go.
anybody really care if Mel Gibson's compound burns down?
not me.
guy probably has three other houses where he can beat up his girlfriends.
yo, Cooper, good luck tomorrow.
hope they throw away the key, man.
Thanks.
go process the suspect. I'll finish up the property report.
you sure? - Yeah.
it's not a problem. I can do both if you-- - Just go.
hello. - Hi.
Mr. And Mrs. Wellington around?
they went to a hotel.
Mrs. Katherine is too scared to stay here.
do you know what hotel? It's really important that we speak with them.
the man that was arrested has been let out on bail.
Sergio? - Um, you know him?
s?
Mrs. Katherine used to yell at him.
for what?
uh, parking his truck in front of the house
and leaving trash on the curb.
recently?
please.
I have a lot of work to do.
Oh, of course, of course. Um, the hotel, please?
Yes, of course.
Katherine tangled with Sergio a couple times.
he has a motive.
well, rape's about power, not sex.
he showed her who's boss. - I don't know.
we've got conflicting stories with the alarm.
she knew her attacker, but she didn't i.D. him
until we showed her the six-Pack?
you really think a woman like that pays attention
to the gardeners in the neighborhood?
they all look alike to her.
he said he didn't do it, and we don't have any physical evidence - to prove that he did. - Yeah, not yet.
DNA takes a few days.
and what about that house?
what about the house? - The roses.
Oh, Lydia, you gonna tell me that we've got the wrong guy
because he's got pretty flowers?
he is a gardener.
sergio didn't show up to his meeting with his lawyer.
you think he skipped town? - I don't know.
what's this?
it's a copy of the property report on those pills.
do something wrong?
how many did you count? - 20.
how many did we book into evidence?
I've been on the job since before your balls dropped,
so you want to start passing judgment on me,
you try wearing a sam browne for 19 years.
working day watch tomorrow.
be here early-- 0500.
no s?
look, if you do know, You've got to tell us right now.
you don't want your boys to have a mommy and daddy in jail.
do you?
I think he went to the bus stop.
you still here?
think they'll come soon?
well, if they don't, You're gonna spend the night in jail.
you gonna play with me?
I am gonna kick your ass.
man, your shot is whack. - Ugh!
Yeah, well, there's a gangster with a limp
doing 20 years who would strongly disagree.
you shot him?
Yeah.
man, that's cool.
Oh. Come on!
Oh.
well, it looks, uh-- Looks like it's time to go.
you know what?
I'm gonna give you my number.
and if you need anything,
don't hesitate to call, all right?
good to meet you.
it's gonna be all right.
okay?
check it out-- Jean jacket. - That's him.
that's him, isn't it? All right, let's just
Yeah, I'm just gonna leisurely park here.
No! Whoa, watch out! Watch out! Watch out! Watch out! Watch out!
Ugh! - Whoa, damn!
??? - Don't move. Don't move. Don't move.
sir. Sir.
back off, please. Back off.
back off, please.
you guys, get back in your cars, please. - Back off. Back off.
Yes, this is detective Lydia Adams.
king 54 is my code. I have a pedestrian that's been hit.
it's hot.
we're not buying any bullshit calls today.
we got to clock out on time.
there's somewhere I got to be this afternoon.
doctor said sergio has a fractured pelvis and a shattered leg.
he's gonna need a few surgeries,
and he'll probably be in the hospital a couple months.
taxpayers' problem now.
wonder what his family's gonna do.
he shouldn't have run-- Looks guilty.
another woman was raped on the westside last night.
they caught the guy,
and he confessed to the other rapes.
but not ours? - Nope.
all right, so, Sergio's not our guy,
but that doesn't mean he didn't rape our victim.
we're here to investigate a child-abuse complaint.
I didn't call the police.
I did. She hit me with a belt.
is that true, ma'am?
I found out from daniel's teacher he's been cutting class,
and when I asked him about it, he lied,
so I hit him.
come here, kid.
how long ago did this happen?
a few hours ago.
how many times she hit you?
three-- Whacked me right on the butt.
she hit you anywhere else? - No.
she hit you with her fist or another object?
no, just the belt.
has this happened before? - No.
all right, I'm gonna need to take that belt and put it into evidence.
he's been acting out a little, and I felt like I had to
am i going to jail?
you called the police on your mom
because she disciplined you for ditching school?
that's child abuse. I've got rights.
who told you that? - My friends.
hit him again.
you know what? You got some bad advice from your buddies on the playground, pal.
you don't ever call the police on your mom.
had that been my mom, you'd be calling me from the floor.
I got to be back here again because you were ditching class,
I'm gonna peel this big belt off, and i'm gonna hit you myself!
you got it?!
John. - Get inside.
have a nice day.
detectives.
uh, is Katherine here, please? We have some additional questions.
Um...she's asleep right now, so
it's important.
our lawyer has, uh, advised us not to talk to you unless he's present.
your lawyer?
she's fragile right now, and with Sergio in the hospital,
I thought it would be a good idea.
I'm-- I'm sure you understand.
thank you.
rape victims don't usually lawyer up...
Mnh-mnh. - ...not even on the westside.
wait, wait, wait, wait, you're telling me that the kid called the cops on his mom because he was cutting class?
Yeah. Can you believe that?
anything's possible When the devil winds are blowing.
10, 000 years, parents have been hitting their kids.
that's the trouble with society today
two kids get into a fight on the playground, they go to counseling.
getting a beatdown builds character.
it worked for me.
Oh, yeah, you're the picture of mental health.
Hey, boot, how did your parents punish you?
did your daddy pick the marshmallows out of your hot chocolate,
or did he just get really, really disappointed? Mm-Hmm.
Hey, Coop, what's wrong with you, man? Where's your sense of humor?
all right. We still on?
he's sick?
well, is the commissioner gonna postpone, Or is it gonna happen?
what the hell's wrong with him?
I think the Santa Anas blew a stick up his ass.
Oh. - You going to nate's funeral on sunday?
you?
am I what?
you gonna go to Nate's funeral on sunday?
Yeah. Another happy day.
that's my favorite chile to make pozole with.
look, Mrs. Wellington is too upset to talk to us,
so we thought you'd help us out.
um, I don't know if you've heard, but Sergio's been in an accident,
and he's in the hospital.
is he hurt very bad?
Yeah. - Yeah.
she didn't want to file a report,
didn't want to make an i.D.
but you just had to push it, didn't you?
I was just doing my job, Lydia.
she didn't want to call the police In the first place, remember?
her husband did. - We had a crime,
we had a suspect, and we had two i.D.S.
Unh-unh.
and we had a rapist out there- With not one victim, not two, but four! - No, no, no.
we had a reluctant victim, an appearance of a crime, - And a convenient suspect. - Yeah, reluctant victim.
I've had a reluctant victim before who didn't come forth, and you know what?
the asshole went on to rape and kill somebody else.
and I had a 14-year-old girl whose uncle raped her repeatedly.
and we pushed her and pushed her until finally she hanged herself with nylons.
what is your problem?!
there is a man lying in a hospital bed right now
whose family is gonna go hungry because of us!
?????
Hey, Cooper.
social services called about that kid they picked up yesterday.
Richard? - Yeah. He ran away.
?????? we really appreciate you a lcoming down.
well, she's hanging in there.
the rapist responsible for the other rapes
was caught and confessed to the assaults.
what does that mean? - Nothing.
it still doesn't clear Sergio Moreno for what he did to my client.
normally, I would agree with you,
but Sergio's DNA wasn't found in your client's home.
neither were his fingerprints.
well, he was wearing work gloves, like I said.
Oh, no, you never told us that.
I don't like your tone, detective.
no, Peter, it's okay.
if I didn't tell you, I meant to. I'm-- I'm sorry.
I was just so upset, and everything happened so fast
we've spoke to people in the neighborhood,
and they said there's a man that visits you often.
is that right?
lots of people come in and out
my yoga instructor, the florist, the interior designer.
I run a really busy household.
what about this man?
he come in and out, too?
it's, um, Ken, my tennis instructor.
he gives private lessons?
Yes.
in your bedroom?
she doesn't have to answer that.
we found his prints all over your room
your night stand, mirrors.
you weren't raped, were you, Katherine?
Katherine... tell them it's-- That's not true.
you lied.
you were supposed to be gone three more days.
got home early. Ken went out the window.
Oh, my god, Katherine, with- With Ken- Ken?
Yeah, it doesn't feel so great, does it?
I know what goes on during your business trips.
Ken has been with half the women in the club!
Yeah, and what about you?
Everyone's-- - Whoa, wait. Wait a minute.
wait a minute. Let me get this straight.
sergio Moreno is in the hospital, he almost died, and all you two can do is argue about who's banging who?
I never thought you'd actually arrest anyone.
you're under arrest for filing a false police report.
what? - Stand up, please.
no-- No, you can't do-- - Stand up!
well, do something!
you still want to keep this case?
officer Cooper!
what happened?
another kid punched me at the place they took me to,
so I left.
you can't do that kind of crap.
you mad at me?
no. You- You should have called.
I'm not going back there. - Where you gonna go?
with you. You can adopt me.
I can't.
why not?
I got to go.
please take me with you.
come on, man. I don't want to go back there.
look, kid.
I did all I can do.
man you.
don't worry. I'll take care of it.
hold on a second.
I'm surprised you're happy to see me.
usually you look like you want to slit my throat.
not this time.
we just want you to do what you do best
and help sergio sue Katherine Wellington.
Yeah. - Okay.
Hey, leave your phone, radio, handcuffs in the car.
check your taser and weapon here.
you've served 20 years for rape and murder.
you've attended a. A. earned a college degree,
and successfully completed anger management.
what have you learned from your counseling?
that god is gracious...
...and that everyone is worthy of forgiveness...
...even me.
officer John Cooper,
son of Mr. Cooper and a victim's representative,
would like to speak.
I am here today...
not seeking retribution.
I'm here to safeguard the lives of the citizens I'd sworn to protect
and to demand accountability for a murderer and rapist.
a family lost a daughter...
... a daughter that never had the chance to go to college...
to get married...
to have children.
I grew up in a household with this man.
and i want to ensure that he is never given the opportunity
to inflict this kind of pain on another person ever again.
Monica's last moments on this earth were filled with torture, suffering, and pleas for mercy.
my father should stay in here until the day he dies.
you think I'm scared?
this ain't shit.
uncuff me, mother.
it wasn't me.
I swear on my grandmother, it wasn't me.
just let me go, mother.
sometimes cops find a case can dig them into a hole.
before sunrise, detective Sammy Bryant will discover just how hard it can be to dig yourself out.
I'm telling you, this was an airtight case.
it could float. - Yeah, right. Not in this line of business.
so, this fool killed the guy, and he's standing over the dead body,talking crap to the dead body right here.
Oh, here?
so, he drops the gun, pull up in the u-Boat.
Oh, who pulled up? Muro?
Oh, man, Albert -- He could mess up a one-Car funeral.
exactly. Kind of makes you wonder him or the suspect.
so, Albert asks the guy, "what happened?"
and the guy says, "I shot the bastard."
Wow. - Oh, no, no, but here's the punchline.
Albert doesn't mirandize him.
he just hooks him up, puts him in the car,and starts interrogating him.
without a miranda warning, none of it is admissible.
I guess he was so excited to make the murder arrest,he just forgot.
great. Now the court's gonna throw out Albert's testimony.
gone, and now all we have is Naomi Chester.
you know what sucks?
a cop sees a murder and can't talk about it.
she's supposed to be pretty reliable. Case still has a chance.
you're early.
now, what's the call time?
and did they send a limo or just a town car?
okay. Maybe not so reliable.
more coffee?
Oh, no, I'm fine.
that's certainly true.
I guess your partner wasn't hungry.
uh...
he's not my partner, not fully. I'm -- I'm still a trainee.
sound thrilled.
Yeah. Well, I'm almost done.
he's taught me a lot, actually.
I'm just, uh, ready for more.
just give me the damn ball, you know?
Yeah. Slow your roll, Keyshawn. Sure you'll get your chance.
you watch football?
Hey, I got two older brothers. I don't really have a choice.
Kaya, 3 needs tabasco sauce, and 4 wanted eggs with onions, not cheese.
I'm on it! - He sounds angry.
whatever.
it's not like I even want this job.
what do you want to do? - Sing.
but, um, criminal justice will probably end up paying the bills,so I'll transfer soon.
you go to law school?
hell no. Are you kidding?
my dad would kill me. He's a cop.
Yeah. Yeah. I'll be back.
I hope so.
I was gonna send a search party. - You all right?
a drunk and disorderly call came out around the corner.
I already bought it. - You didn't eat.
um...
pay the girl. Let's roll.
just, uh, keep the change.
Oh, you don't want your receipt?
no, I'm all right.
well, you know what?
you might need it.
uh, yeah. Right.
I gotta go.
well, be careful out there protectin' and servin', Officer...sherman.
you too... Kaya?
Petey, you want to flip one?
sure.
it's really hot, so don't touch.
when do I flip it?
now's good.
good.
who taught you?
my mom.
but the real secret is to... marry a woman who knows how to cook.
my dad said the same thing.
is mom up yet?
Uh...no. Uh, not yet.
she was -- She was up with the baby.
how much longer are you staying with us?
I don't know. A while, I guess.
is that all right with you?
mom doesn't cry as much when you're around.
detective Bryant.
10: 30, okay.
see you then.
something smells good!
pancakes?
my favorite!
Hey, can you turn on the heat back here?
what are you looking at?
nothing.
why are y'all so quiet?
watching "cops," all y'all do is drive, yap,talk shit about your wives.
well, this ain't tv.
Whew! I sense a little tension between you guys.
what? Someone leave the toilet seat up? - Aw, come on! Come on!
pay attention!
it's colder than a witch's tit, and you are sweating bullets.
are you high?
what did you say?
must be some strong shit. Can I get some, too?
Ugh! My nose!
Aah! You broke my nose!
Aah!
you broke my nose, you pigs!
Aah! - John! John!
on the right. - What's that about, dude?!
you broke my nose!
ma'am, what's wrong? - You all right?
they had guns! Guns!
who did?
who?
all right. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Guys, guys, guys, come on. Be safe.
what is wrong with what I have on?
Oh, you really have to ask?
we don't have time for this.
no, listen, we cannot have her testify looking like the fourth "charlie's angel."
I guested on "charlie's angels" -- A couple of times.
they didn't have me back, though.
farrah was jealous.
look, we have to cover your chichis.
if you've got it, flaunt it.
who's paying for this?
Hey, we get the conviction, Fernandez is gonna reimburse us.
going on your card, not mine.
Oh, no, no, no, no. This is a 50/50 split, partner.
Hey, look, memory is a fragile thing,
and you had an incredibly traumatic experience.
don't beat yourself up about it.
so, now what?
we're working several other angles.
something will break.
Yeah.
listen, let's get this straight.
a police officer was killed, detective.
no one in this department is giving up on catching the men who killed your partner.
uh, um...
a witness from another case just showed up.
uh, can you give me a few moments?
thank you. - Okay.
hey...
stealing field-trip money from little kids.
that is some twisted...
tell you something, man. Two 13-Year-Olds with 9-Millimeters?
you got to love the ghetto.
well, makes sense. Unarmed fourth graders.
what are they gonna do, throw a transformer at somebody?
where the hell's optimus prime when you need him?
Yeah. - Right.
I'll be right back. I'm gonna grab a coffee.
sorry about the other day.
you all right?
it's like Coop says.
if i'm not out here, who else is it gonna be?
is he all right?
eh, hard to tell.
not if your eyes are open.
he's my training officer, chickie.
okay. Well, rank doesn't matter if you're dead.
you got to be able to trust the guy watching your back...
no matter who it is.
Hey, let me out... - shut up!
what's up?
I don't think that kid was on the bus.
Hey.
Hey, what's your name?
Hey, Michael. I'm John.
were you, uh -- Were you on that bus that got robbed?
no. - No?
do you go to school, Michael?
do you know who robbed it?
did you see it happen?
where are your parents, Michael?
gone. You gonna take me to jail?
no. No, of course not.
where do you live, though, michael? What's your address?
the magic cave.
Okey， Dokey Smokey makes us hide in the magic cave，so they don't take us to jail.
okay.
go get the paramedics.
according to the fingerprint database,Michael peterson is 9 years old.
9? He looks 6.
malnutrition probably stunted his growth.
he was in the system? - Mm-Hmm.
parents should be shot.
well, his father's at Folsom, and his mother's dead.
she was a prostitute.
Where's Michael been?
no other relatives, so he's been at a foster home over on 89th.
went missing about three weeks ago.
three weeks?
what, no amber alert?
we've been looking. - Right.
talked about a magic cave.
kids at that age like to imagine any small space as a cave.
he's at a pre-Operational state of development.
Pre-Operational? You just told me the kid was alone for three weeks.
he mentioned two other kids, also.
he's probably making it up.
I've done hundreds of these cases.
I don't need the M. E. to tell me Michael's been abused.
but a kid this traumatized will engage In all sorts of magical thinking...
you know, he was pretty specific. - ...as a self-protective mechanism.
I understand that. He was specific, though.
called them by name -- Tyrell and Andy.
look, I-I appreciate the great work that you've done in spotting him.
okay? I really do. But now it's my case.
and expert care is what this child needs. - Expert care? What expert? You?
I have a master's degree in child psychology.
and I got a PhD in street.
who gives a shit? Oh, 20 years! - And 20 years' experience.
you know what?! I don't care! That kid is telling the truth, - And you're too lazy to do your job! - John!
do your job!
Mike was a good guy.
he didn't deserve to get shot.
you know, what happens between a man and another man's wife is nobody's business, especially her husband's.
we, uh -- We appreciate you doing this. - When do we do this?
it's at 3: 00.
I -- I thought it was this morning.
tooley was a miss-Out. - What?
he missed the bus from jail to court.
there won't be another one till at least noon.
you okay with that?
sure.
great. You're gonna do just fine, Naomi. I know it.
can you, uh, excuse me for a moment?
counselor, can I speak to you, please?
Oh, man, man. That is four hours from now.
I cannot go that long without my medication
that woman's a straight-up drunk.
I don't think she's gonna make it.
well, she better.
she's gonna need to get something soon.
look, legally, I can't make any suggestions.
but a happy witness is a cooperative witness.
catch my drift?
Hey.
calm down.
I'll be right there.
mcbride from sex crimes has it covered.
so what?
she's good at taking tests, right?
that's all it takes to be a detective.
she doesn't know the streets.
4478 Vance Street.
A-43-- Unable to respond. Show us code 6.
we're not buying the call? - Nope.
we not gonna respond to a burglary call?
you questioning my instincts, too?
Yes! - Oh, really?
now you're the man, huh?
what we're gonna do, boot,is we're gonna roll around all day,and we're gonna show the kid's picture to everyone,anyone who'll look at it! We're not gonna chase the goddamn radio!
so, you respect my stripes, Or you get the out of my car!
obviously, he's dead. I'm his wife. - I understand.
and I'm his wife. - Yes. Ma'am...
she won't transfer the money from Nate's savings account into our checking account.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Moretta. I've explained the situation as clearly as I can.
well, explain it to me.
I need an original copy of Mr. Moretta's death certificate.
and what's that right there?
it's a printout from a pdf.
can you wait outside for a second?
that's the wife of my partner.
okay, he was killed protecting your right to give her shit.
I'm a reservist.
I didn't lose this finger in the kitchen.
so, then, you understand what it's like to see a friend killed.
your world stands still. The rest of the world moves on.
no one seems to care.
I sympathize with mrs. Moretta. I do.
but rules are rules. - I respect your rules.
I do. I respect your rules. But I'm asking you for a favor,from one servant to another.
I'll do the transfer,but I'll need an original copy by morning.
thank you.
Hey, it's gonna be okay.
I'm gonna go downtown, get his documents together,And I'll bring the paperwork back here.
okay?
thank you so much. Thank you.
I'm gonna get this guy. I promise.
what?
we're gonna get him.
okay. - We're gonna get him.
okay. - I promise.
all right.
I promise.
this lady has got stories for days. - Ooh.
she looks beautiful right there. I bet if we gave her that drink,it would really get started.
Hey. 2: 12-- We got to get back to court.
Mm. - You get lunch.
Oh, what happened to "50/50," partner?
how long has she been in the bathroom?
shit! - Shit!
Oh! I'll bet she went out back!
Hey! Hey, Naomi!
shit.
okay, look... - I'll get the car.
hmm? No?
excuse me.
you seen this kid?
can't say that I have. Is he okay?
Yeah, he is now. Thank you.
what are you looking for?
he was found in the area.
we're just trying to backtrack, find out a history.
with all the gangs out here, you don't really see kids much anymore.
I wish I could be more helpful.
thank you.
how long are we gonna keep doing this?
they're gonna start looking for us.
Oh, come on. What the hell are you doing?
what does it look like? Getting my swerve on.
Ugh!
Aw, what the hell, lady? Look at this mess.
Ahh!
damn it! - I'm calling the cops.
Hey! We are the cops, okay?
come on, get out of here. - Come on?
sorry about that. - Yeah, sure.
how long you need it? Couple of days.
we need another decoy for a surveillance.
it doesn't matter to me.
everything you see in here is gonna get crushed In the next few days, anyway.
it's a waste of american ingenuity, if you ask me.
they'll be ready for you any minute.
Oh, god. I can't do this!
Oh, listen, listen. Look, he can't hurt you.
we're right here. - Yeah.
tooley shot mike down like a dog.
tooley did that to make a statement.
well, he made a statement, all right. I get the message.
okay, listen -- - God, I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
you know what? You don't strike me as the type to get scared very easily,So why now?
I was flattered when they asked me to testify.
silly, ain't it?
it's just been so long since...anybody wanted anything from me.
but I didn't think I would really have to really do it.
Yeah, but here we are, and you speak for Mike.
and everybody wants to hear what you have to say.
this is the biggest show imaginable.
and they're gonna be hanging on every word.
not only is this the role of a lifetime,but there's no way that they'll ever, ever be able to cut you out.
and if you don't talk, Tooley skates.
they're ready for you, Ms. Chester.
Sharpshootin' Dave. How are you, man?
Hey, kid.
how's the dynamic duo?
Uh-oh.
someone pee in your cornflakes?
Hey, it all right, man.
you know how it is. Kid's salty, used to hang on your every word.
now he's smelling his own piss, looking at you like you're the asshole.
fatherhood, man.
natural course of things.
you know, if he didn't chafe and buck up against you,you wouldn't know you were turning him into a good cop.
now you know.
you all right, man?
why don't you lay off that shit? You don't look so good.
you should come with me to a meeting.
you should kiss my ass.
Mike had his -- His hands in the air.
he was shaking.
he was pleading with Tooley, "Come on, look, man, I'm -- I'm -- I'm sorry.
but Tooley just walked closer to him.
he put the gun to his head, and he blew him back.
Mike was laying on the ground. His -- His legs were twitching.
tooley stood over him, laughing.
he still had the gun in his hand.
he looked at mike, and he said, "Guess who just got fu--" Oh.
excuse my language, judge. Is it okay if i say that in court?
you may continue.
damn.
she do have presence.
you did good, kid.
all right, where do you want to go to dinner?
my pick? - It's on the state.
pacific dining car. - Ooh. Ooh.
snap!
go home, ben.
just tell me why.
what about this kid makes it worth losing your job.
kid's telling the truth.
I feel it.
so, what's the plan?
there is none.
just gonna go out and canvass until I can get some answers.
okay.
I'm going with you.
no, if I get caught, I'll just get demoted.
they'll fire you.
if I'm gonna get fired,might as well be for doing the job the right way.
there is something on your mind - Kill those damn lights. - ...brings happiness。
what you want, ese?
you don't remember me?
what about my partner? You remember him?
huh?
this is James Ellroy's favorite restaurant.
I had a callback for "l. A. Confidential."
then I heard Kim Basinger was interested.
Mm. - Story of my life.
you know, you come here with...
with such promise.
and it grinds you up and spits you out.
and K won an oscar.
but you were great today.
I was.
you know, something strange happens.
when everyone's looking at me...
I go into this -- This zone.
I-I-I'm outside of myself.
it's like I could see Tooley kill Mike.
like you could see him? - Yeah.
wait a minute. You'd see him, right?
Pfft! Of course not.
What?! - What?
I was in my apartment.
it was that matt -- Uh, Matt Johnson across the street.
he's the one who actually saw what happened.
I don't believe this shit.
why didn't Johnson come forward?
meth.
he's not all that dependable.
you know, Mike was a nice guy.
and that Tooley was a piece of shit.
OOP! Excuse me.
Mike was just trying to help her.
wasn't his fault they fell in love.
all right, so you lied in open court?
Hey, everybody on that block knows what happened.
and when you people came around asking questions,I told I'd seen it.
I was flattered -- This is true.
but there was more at stake than my ego.
I mean, somebody had to stand up.
I mean, it's the truth.
he killed Mike. Your cop saw him with the gun.
he is guilty as hell.
unfortunately, so are you.
Hey! - You have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against you In a court of law.
Hey! - Excuse me.
can I get another vodka on the rocks?
Oh, for christ's sakes. - Double, please.
I do not believe this.
Yeah, well, it's gonna be a long time before you get another drink,so you might as well get your swerve on.
you think I'm scared?
uncuff me, mother.
Hey, you that white boy, huh?
I heard about you.
crying like a bitch, falling all over the ground.
everybody in the hood was talking about it.
but I wasn't there. It wasn't me.
I swear on my grandmother, it wasn't me.
just let me go, mother.
you seen this kid?
why don't you take a look at him for two seconds? It's a little kid.
have you seen this kid before?
have you seen this kid? This little boy?
place is awful.
you know how many registered sex offenders live around here?
Yeah. You get anything?
no. You?
no.
nothing glamorous about being a detective.
why do you think I stayed in patrol?
this cave...could be anything.
Yeah. We got to think like this kid.
I mean, how far could he get?
you know, a...kid that young, alone for so long? He couldn't have gotten far.
someone around here has seen him.
you guys seen this kid?
let you know if we find something.
appreciate it. - All right.
I don't know.
sometimes the only satisfaction you get in this job is knowing you...tried your best.
you know what? Just go home.
I'm staying.
all right. You take the east side. I'll take the west.
all right.
I'm gonna free your wrists.
you move too fast, I'll blow you up.
all right.
what you want me to do?
I want you to dig.
are they gonna let Tooley go?
I don't know. It's gonna be a mistrial at the very least.
everyone was so scared.
nobody was gonna do the right thing.
Yeah, well, sometimes doing the right thing is the wrong thing.
can you give us a second?
you're gonna have to dig deep to get through this.
you don't need that liquor crutch.
you're stronger than you think.
thank you.
Hey.
you guys have any spare change I can have?
Hey, shitbird.
Hey!
you feeling okay, buddy?
you seen this kid?
I think I have seen this kid.
Yeah, he goes around saying "Okey Dokey Smokey" all the time.
remember where you saw him?
no. Mnh-Mnh. No idea.
but I do remember seeing him at the new lofts.
there was a skate park there.
what -- What lofts? - Yeah.
I know the skate park. - Yeah.
Yeah. Okay.
you think this is fair?
you ain't shit.
you can't do it, can you?
I don't put in no work no more!
it was one of the pee wees!
they don't know no better! They don't respect nothing!
it was you.
I was there! - It was you!
I never said I wasn't!
I stopped doing dirt a while ago, ese.
you've obviously been following me.
I got a job. I got a life.
I got a kid on the way. I want to see my son get born.
you're that dude on the other side of the glass.
my lawyer told me about you.
you couldn't i. d. me then.
what makes you sure you're so right now?
Nate had a family.
you hear me? Nate had a family!
well his family! And yours, too!
if you're gonna do it, do it!
turn around.
turn around!
I ever see you again, I'll kill you.
you're just gonna leave me out here?
Hey! Hey!
what do you want me to say?
you know, no one believed me。
when I told them my dad was molesting my older sister.
it wasn't until he raped and murdered my 16-year-old girlfriend that anyone paid any attention to anything I had to say.
that's the power of the badge.
when we say something, people listen.
we got to speak up for those who can't speak for themselves.
Yeah, but, John, the guy was a basehead.
how many lofts did we hit?
coffee's on me.
we're gonna need it. You sure you're ready to go back to work?
Yeah. Think we have a choice?
Yeah. Yeah, we'll be there in 10.
why don't we get you guys something to eat, huh?
I need a drink.
I was surprised you called.
what happened?
couldn't get what you said out of my head.
so I went down the sex-offenders list one by one.
stopped here, I talked to him, and left.
magic cave.
the letter mentions encountering police officers in the park with michael's picture...and my subsequent visit.He said the walls were closing in.
how'd you find the body?
he called it in before he hung himself.
hanged.
you were right.
I was wrong.
Petey, what's going on?
ask mom.
what's going on?
Um...I'm...
I'm moving back to El Paso, with my parents, just until we figure things out.
you're selling the house.
Yeah, um...
every time I look around, I just -- I see nate.
and I'm driving myself crazy. I just.
things are moving so fast. I just -- I need to slow down.
you understand, right?
Yeah.
Yeah. - Well,I 'll do the best I can.
you were right, Varinia.
vengeance alone is not enough.
to become like your enemy is to lose to him.
but what's important isn't our living or our dying but this new thing we've created, however briefly.
a world without slaves.
and if you die, who will tell that story?
live so that I will live.
so that we will live on.
so that it won't be wasted or forgotten.
did you see the look he gave you, Varinia?
I didn't.
and even if I had, I wouldn't care.
what sort of look?
what look, you? What look?
Ow!
what look?! - Varinia!
No!
I made a promise once to tell our story.
it began here in a small village in Gaul where I was born a free woman.
then the Romans came and destroyed my world and made me a slave.
nothing and no one could stand against the Romans.
but Rome herself was torn by conflict.
bIoody civil wars raged for years 'between the plebeians and their rivals, the patricians, 'led by senators like Marcus Crassus, the richest man in the world.
as a child, he had seen his father murdered in the Forum.
Crassus had risen from the ashes of his family's defeat 'to unlimited wealth and unlimited ambition.
ambition kept in check only by his rivals, like Antonius Agrippa.
the civil wars were over. Men smiled at one another in public.
but the fighting never stopped.'
Agrippa. Fishing for votes?
no, just enjoying our democratic way of life.
a new wine. From Spain.
delicious. But I like your cupbearer better.
any news from Spain?
a great victory by Pompey. - Another?
the man is positively boring in his triumphs.
I shall console myself with the way Crassus must feel.
Pompey's no great warrior.
I heard he's got so fat on the riches of his triumphs he can barely ride his horse.
disparage Pompey all you like but the man gets the job done.
victory over vermin-ridden Gaulish peasants is hardly the mark of military distinction.
they say he will be consul.
this grape...
... is not to my satisfaction. More wine.
I think I'm going to borrow your wife, Cornelius.
the wealth of a man like Crassus could be seen in gold or silver 'but its true measure was in flesh.
thousands of slaves.
they lived out their short lives in a world of suffering 'at the whim of their masters.
no Roman citizen gave them a second thought.'
over there.
greetings, citizens.
today we offer a group of barbarians from Gaul, courtesy of the great Pompey.
ahoy, Batiatus. What brings you up from Capua?
the same thing as you, I would imagine.
my stock needs freshening.
although how a modest man from the country can bid against a senator...
I might as well go home. - A modest man from the country?
yours is widely known as the finest gladiatorial school in all Italy.
you flatter me. - No, not in the least.
look at this beauty. And a virgin.
a virgin. Given the appetite of our frontier troops, I rather doubt that.
being a virgin is overrated.
it's just an excuse to inflate the price.
good teeth.
wide hips. And an excellent breeder.
magnificent.
she's easy on the eye, I'll grant you, but these Gauls have thin blood.
they rarely last the winter. It would be throwing money away.
why, Batiatus, are you in love?
don't worry, my friend. I won't bid against you.
Oh, you're too kind, Senator.
though I may need a favor someday. - Oh... Of course. Of course.
500 sesterces!
done!
how can the Senate choose Pompey over you as the next consul?
it would be a close vote.
I bought you a gift.
it's beautiful.
you are too generous. - Am I?
I suppose I might be.
in the arms of the richest man in Rome - 'and her husband's best friend... ' - Show me.
... Helena might be forgiven her ignorance of the origin of that bracelet, its true cost.
what is hell?
hell is that place where the simplest action becomes painful.
where it hurts to walk... ' - Move it!
... to breathe, even to think.
the gold mines of Egypt were such a hell.
among the Thracian slaves condemned to an early death 'there was one who would shake the Roman world.
his name - Spartacus.'
pick it up!
pick it up!
No!
stop!
so he's a Thracian, yes?
worse. He's an animal.
good. That's even better.
this is your lucky day, Thracian.
what kind of a place is this?
move!
fresh meat!
shut your hole! Get back to work.
you stink, animals. Clean yourselves.
this way.
I want all these chopped into thin slices. I would not serve this to a dog!
I could get used to this.
I am Gannicus. This is Spartacus.
david the Jew. He never talks. Some say he can't.
you're Thracians?
the crowd likes Thracians. - Be quiet, Nordo. Eat.
didn't get your name, friend.
you are not my friend. I don't want to know your name or your story.
why not?
because I might meet you in the arena, and then I will kill you.
why wait?
you'll get plenty of chances to fight.
save it for when you have no choice. Eat.
you must be the new Thracians.
I can always tell Thracians. You stink like pigs.
you must be Crixus. - You've heard of me.
who hasn't? "Crixus of the big nose." I'm not surprised you could smell us.
enough!
to your cells! Now!
well, move, slaves!
you, Spartacus.
where did you learn to fight?
when a Roman asks you a question, you answer, slave.
fighting Romans.
good day to you, Crassus.
Crassus. What a pleasant surprise.
I had no idea you still partook of such common pleasures as our public baths.
I do not disdain the public.
Ah. You love mankind. It's only people you can't stand.
now, why is it that those who are most in favor of mob rule stand most to benefit from the public's greed and stupidity?
why is it that the rich are always so keen on reform after they've made their fortune and not before?
the republic was a fine form of government when Rome was a backwater city state.
times have changed. Rome rules the world now.
and one man with a strong vision must rule Rome.
so power... should be wielded by whom?
the educated? The wealthy? The aristocrat? By Crassus?
or by Pompey?
well, Plato did say that leadership must be left to the educated.
that leaves Pompey out. Julius Caesar, you mean.
you've heard what they say about him?
every woman's man and every man's woman.
but you're right, Pompey overreaches.
if he's not careful, his head will be found hanging in the Forum just like that of your father and your brother.
was it something I said?
this... is the Roman short sword, the gladius, from which you get your names.
22 inches long. Three pounds in weight.
a stabbing weapon for close work.
you kill a man with this and you can smell his sweat, taste his breath.
but you sons of whores are not worthy of fighting with the gladius yet.
so you will use these wooden swords while I teach you.
you, slave.
pick it up.
come at me.
again.
too slow, slave. Pick it up.
too slow.
Cinna!
so what do you think of our Thracian slaves? Good, huh?
they have spirit but no real talent.
I see. So you think they're just lucky?
and Cinna, this boy was very expensive.
don't damage my property.
enough! Go! Bring her.
come.
come here.
very good.
better.
come.
let me smell your hair.
Oh...
you know...
... I can be a very good master.
Oh, yes. Now, now... now.
now, kiss me. - No!
No! No!
hold her!
No! No!
Hey, Spartacus.
how's your nose? - You got lucky.
do I have to break it again?
so where did you fight Romans? - Thrace.
you? - Gaul, where I was caught.
then later in Sicily where slaves rebelled.
you rebelled? - Two times.
the Romans, they were terrified of us. They still are.
now they kill a man just for talking about it.
why did it fail?
fighting Romans is like fighting a grist mill.
the stone keeps on turning.
no matter how many times you attack it, in the end it grinds you down to dust.
faster!
put your backs into it, you sons of whores!
why do Africans use the spear and net?
it amuses the Romans to turn us into fishermen.
I was a farmer. I never saw a net until I came here.
Nordo, this man is trouble. Leave him be.
Draba, they ever pit the knife against the spear?
the spear always wins.
enough talking! Back to work.
well, move, you scum!
put your body behind the blow!
good, Draba! Push him back.
faster!
harder! Are you men or are you women?
tomorrow some of you have the honor of fighting in the arena in Capua.
nothing matters but that you fight well and with courage.
do this and even the defeated may receive mercy.
however, if that is not your fate then the crowd will expect you to meet your death honorably, in the Roman manner, like this.
Spartacus... kneel.
a defeated gladiator may beg for mercy by raising his hand thus.
the death blow is delivered in a single thrust to the neck...
here.
that is how a gladiator from the house of Batiatus dies.
what's the matter, Thracian? Lost your appetite? Eat! Drink!
tomorrow we die. - I'm not dying tomorrow.
the gods decide when we die.
I don't believe in the gods. - You don't believe in the gods?
when I look at the heavens I see only stars.
blasphemer! You could be struck down for that.
no bolt of lightning.
so what do you believe in? - Us.
our will. We decide when we die and how.
eat anyway. You'll need your strength for tonight.
what happens tonight? - War, little Thracian.
sweet war!
quiet! Sit down!
a little wisdom.
a man is no good in the arena if his parts shrivel up.
- A gladiator is not a litter slave.
he is a man. - Yeah!
and a man needs a woman.
quiet, quiet.
for those of you who fight tomorrow,
I graciously lend you these lovelies.
use them well.
and in the morning, show me what men you are! Cinna!
this is yours.
idiot! David doesn't fight tomorrow.
Crixus.
you like to play rough, Thracian. Here.
Batiatus asks that she be made more pliant.
see to it.
come here, woman!
I'm Spartacus.
what are you called?
you look cold. Here.
the stones are cold at night.
you sleep there. I won't bother you.
- Wake up, you sons of whores!
line up by the doors!
get a move on down there!
my name is Varinia.
varinia.
come on, out.
today you are expected to bring honor to the house of Batiatus.
fail to do so and you will curse the day you were born.
where are they going? - Capua.
they fight today.
the Thracian, the one they call Spartacus. Is he any good?
couldn't say. He's different, though.
how?
all the gladiators here are strong men. Brave.
but they are still slaves. They accept it. Not him.
he will not last long.
you were with him last night?
yes and no.
you, girl! Come here!
you will attend me at the games but if you give me any trouble,
I promise that our previous encounter will feel like a mother's caress.
now, go and get yourself cleaned up.
line up!
I appreciate your contribution to my games, Batiatus.
few people understand the financial burden I'm expected to shoulder while on duty in these dreary provinces.
thank you. And I appreciate the loan of your troops.
security at an establishment like mine does not come cheaply either.
one hand washes the other.
of course. More wine!
a perfectly ripened pear.
although somewhat bruised. - A problem with discipline.
but we're working on it. Aren't we?
Yes, my Lord.
on the crosses - who are they? - Arsonists.
they wear the tunica molesta, soaked in pitch.
change your mind about the gods?
if there are gods in this world, they're not here.
burn! Burn! Burn! Burn!
Crixus...
... versus Gaius.
Gannicus...
... versus Antonius.
Spartacus...
versus Commodus.
this new gladiator, Spartacus. Is he really a Thracian or are you still passing off Greeks?
he's the real thing, through and through.
any good? - Cinna thinks the world of him.
don't you, Cinna? - Very well. A thousand on Spartacus.
let's see some killing!
kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
are you hurt?
I thought in the mines I'd seen man at his worst.
I was wrong.
a slave has no choice. - Not me.
the ones who watched, took their pleasure in blood and death.
well, move, slaves!
harder! Faster! Put your back to it!
can't you lay with me, Spartacus?
is it because Cinna ordered it? - Because Cinna ordered it.
and because Thracian men and women are to remain chaste until married.
slaves don't marry. - I would marry you.
marriage requires a holy man. I thought you didn't believe in the gods.
I believe in what I can see, hear and touch.
my tribe believes man was created by the gods.
that they live in us. - We're flesh and blood, that's all.
that is what an animal is. The Romans say that we are animals.
that we are without souls.
but you are afraid to say that you agree with the Romans.
I believe that I never met anyone like you, Varinia of Gaul...
and that I love you.
will you marry me?
on what, then, would you make a vow?
on the blood that flows through my veins and the breath I take,
I will be yours until the day I die, and in my life there'll be no other but you, I swear.
on the blood that flows in my veins and the breath I take, - I will be yours... - Until the...
until the day I die.
and in the life beyond.
how do you know there is a life beyond? - I have faith.
there will be no other man but you.
I swear.
kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
Spartacus! Spartacus! Spartacus!
master. We have visitors, Master, from Rome.
Cornelius Lucius and his wife, Helena. And Marcus Crassus.
Marcus Crassus is here, and you left him waiting outside?
Oh! Noble Crassus. You do me a great honor, sir.
I am Lentulus Batiatus. Please, sit.
I and my establishment are here to serve you.
some... Some wine to wash away the dust, and some honeyed ice, perhaps?
yes?
how may I serve you? - My friends and I would appreciate a private showing of a pair of Thracians.
excellent choice. Your Honor is obviously a connoisseur.
to the death. - To the death?
that's an unusual request for a private showing.
I see that's you're joking. That's very good. That's very amusing.
I am not laughing.
of course you're not. Well, you've asked for Thracians.
that means that you must want good dagger work.
and I have the best in the world.
but if you want to the death, you won't see nuance, and you won't see subtlety.
certainly won't see quality. Madam.
I'm not a butcher, sir, I am an artist.
Yes. - I want to give you good fighting.
good fighting. And to the death.
I want to see courage.
I want to see passion.
and above all, I want to see finality.
but to the death will cost you.
25, 000 denarii. - You could buy an elephant for that.
done.
and I want no fakery.
no sucking the sand and pretending that they're dying.
if one of them is down, or if both of them are down,
I want one of your trainers to cut their throats.
and they are to understand that.
now, I shall leave 10, 000 on account, and the rest when we have been satisfied.
note the Africans.
theirs is the finest combat and the most skillful but it can be a bore.
it can go on and on.
to see fighting at its best you must see Thracians.
don't you agree, slave master? - Yes, but each kind has its own virtues.
change of plan.
match me a Thracian against a black.
with all due respect, my Lord, that is no match.
when a Thracian's dagger is in the net, he's finished.
Yes, perhaps. But the Africans are not noted for their strategic thinking.
Hannibal, of course, being the exception.
I want to see how long a mentally superior but lesser armed man can last.
my Lord, that sort of experimentation makes for bad blood with the men.
well, for 25, 000 denarii I think you can afford to incur a little bad blood.
begin!
order!
what is it? What is it?
a private fight.
who do you want? - Draba.
Draba!
and David. - David!
now, he's a Jew, yes?
Yes, I know you wanted a Thracian...
no, no, no. This is interesting.
ever seen a Jew fight? Exceptional with the dagger and reputed to be very bright, as well.
who else? - Er...
Spartacus...
and Polymus.
Polymus... Spartacus.
Spartacus?
how do you like them?
all - except that one.
I don't like him.
forgive me, lady, but that man has been in the ring 12 times.
he's very good, very strong, very quick.
who will you match him with? - The African.
what are you doing? - Praying.
how do you pray?
I can show you.
will you do something for me?
something that we do in our tribe?
put your mouth on mine and breathe your soul into me, and I'll breathe mine into you.
and then for all time our souls will be one.
one soul in two bodies.
I will come back to you.
if you don't, I will kill you myself.
you have to save your strength for tomorrow.
I am full of strength.
dagger against net and trident. What kind of match is that?
time.
time!
what are they thinking, I wonder?
gladiators are animals, pure and simple.
if one thinks of them as people, one loses all perspective.
is it true what they say about the Jews? How they mutilate their boys?
would you like to see?
bring me the Jew before he fights.
bring the Jew here.
the rest of you, to the House of Expectation.
Unclothe.
Unclothe.
they do that to their children?
how beastly.
perhaps that explains their skill with the knife.
I want the Jew to fight first. - Of course, sir.
strike! - Kill him! Kill him!
kill him. - Kill him, Jew!
why doesn't he kill him?
kill him!
why didn't he finish him?
don't expect mercy from me out there, Thracian.
live, Draba.
that's what life is for.
if the gods love you...
you die in childhood.
that was extraordinary.
if the second pair is as good as the first, then I shall be well pleased.
strike!
kill him! Kill him!
kill him!
kill him! Strike now!
stop him!
why didn't he kill me?
if he kills me, he lives.
if he turns on the Romans, he dies.
he chooses to die.
who chooses to die?
who chooses to die?
maybe rather than live as a beast,
Draba chose to die as a man.
father!
- Shh.
it was just a dream.
no.
I slept until now.
now I wake.
move, you dogs!
March! I said move!
move!
move, you scum!
is it true that Draba didn't kill any of the Romans?
if a man must throw his life away, he could die better than that.
will you die any better?
he will die like a dog and so will you. So will we all.
are you my friend, Crixus?
was Draba your friend? - Yes. And my teacher.
did he teach you how to die? - He taught me how to live.
I feed you the best food. I give you women.
you live here like kings in idleness on the fat of the land.
and all I expect is your loyalty and obedience.
and what do I get in return?
treachery.
Cinna, fetch me a black man.
kill him.
now there will be no more trouble. The dogs won't even growl.
move it, move it, you cows!
move, slaves!
are we dogs that you snap your whips at us?
Spartacus! Prepare to die! - Cinna!
what the hell is going on out there?
there's too many!
you taught me well, Cinna.
quiet!
quiet!
let him speak!
quiet! Listen to Spartacus!
like you, I've been alone my whole life.
we could never look into each other's eyes.
living like animals!
here is the lesson of Draba.
I will be a man.
my life is my brother's.
live to fight the Romans!
smash the gates!
master! The gladiators! They have revolted!
don't just stand there like a drooling idiot. Help me!
field formation!
go get my litter. We have to get to Capua.
to the garrison. Go!
to victory!
free men and women, listen to me! We must get ready.
Nordo, can you open the armory?
if I have to break the door with my teeth. - Spartacus, look.
David, go.
go. Talk to them.
what do you want me to say?
invite our brothers to join us.
gifts! I bring gifts!
freedom for you and your children! Come, join us!
freedom for you! Join us!
Spartacus always said that you would speak some day.
David, Varinia.
come. - You'll tell me later.
there's one more thing I need to do.
Maecenus! Maecenus!
Oh, thank you, thank you. You've got to stop them.
where is that slave scum headed? - In the hills to the south of here.
there's a lot of valuable property. You must save something!
too late for that. Double time! March!
please.
please.
come on. Let's go. - Look at them.
they're so arrogant, they've lost their formation.
so?
so if attacked, they'd have to fight, man to man.
and who fights better man to man than gladiators, huh?
Crixus, Nordo...
we have guests.
should we not greet them?
apparently there has been an uprising of gladiators in Capua.
the entire garrison has been slain and the slaves have taken to the hills, where their revolt spreads.
this is what I am talking about. This is why we need strong leadership.
I propose that we send the city cohorts to crush this rebellion immediately.
the entire garrison of Rome?
are you out of your mind? To fight slaves?
how many of these dangerous creatures are there? Who are they led by?
it is a job for an overseer and a pack of dogs.
they massacred the entire Capua garrison.
the garrison at Capua...
forgive my bluntness, but an effete band of pretend soldiers.
a slave rebellion is never a simple affair. We all remember Sicily.
twice the slaves attacked.
the second time, they seized the entire island for over a year!
this particular revolt is taking place a mere 100 miles from where we now sit and squabble.
are you suggesting that we recall a legion from the frontier?
Pompey, perhaps? - And wait weeks for him?
will the slaves wait? I don't think so.
we must deal with this matter promptly before it gets out of hand.
but the entire city cohorts?
three. Three full cohorts.
under whose command?
I realize that it is not customary for a man to put his own name forward.
then please do not break precedent.
I was about to suggest that the cohorts be sent under the able command of Titus Glabrus.
my Lord, I hardly know what to say.
thank you for your confidence in me.
if it is the will of the Senate and the people of Rome, then I accept.
if it is indeed the will of the Senate, then, Titus Glabrus, go with our blessings.
fall upon this rabble with all the weight and majesty of Roman law.
we will march across the world and turn it over, stone by stone!
look at them.
they think the war is all won. It hasn't even started.
how are we going to feed them or clothe them, much less train them to fight the Roman Empire?
by teaching them to share the burden.
like free men.
why did you propose Glabrus? He's as thick as he is vain.
but politically dependable. - Why didn't you put yourself forward?
agrippa would have blocked me out of spite.
besides, there's little honor in defeating slaves and terrible shame if one fails.
if Glabrus succeeds, well, a minor rebellion is put down and he owes me a favor.
if he fails, the whole city will be panicked.
and the Senate will embrace a more permanent system of leadership.
fear isn't a bad thing, Caius.
it makes for a more malleable electorate.
Crassus says he wants to be consul in order to restore the former glory of Rome.
but really he wants to transform the consul into a more permanent position. Emperor.
the day that Crassus becomes consul is the day the Roman republic dies.
the time has come to make some decisions.
we must leave? - And go where?
I want to go home. - Everywhere is the same as here.
everywhere it is master and slave.
I go where I go. No man tells Crixus what to do anymore.
come down, Crixus.
this is Crixus the Gaul.
maybe the strongest man among us.
but still, he's only one man.
can you bend this?
now all of these.
we are like the arrows.
separately, we're weak.
but together, we're invincible.
and that's why the Romans worked so hard to divide us tribe by tribe.
we're one tribe, then? - Yes!
is that your will? - Yes!
who will lead us?
stand up if you want to lead.
Spartacus.
Spartacus! Spartacus! Spartacus!
if that is your wish.
but so one man doesn't become a tyrant, we need laws.
what are they? - Whatever we take we hold together.
no man owns anything but his own weapon.
we could be rich with the gold we take. - We'll make the Romans our slaves!
Yeah! - I will not be a slave owner!
slavery is an evil.
an evil that turns all men slaves and slave masters into animals.
there will be equality and justice between man and woman.
we're one tribe, then? - Yes.
one people? - Yes!
is that your will?
it is my will.
it is my will.
it is my will.
it is my will.
then this is what we'll do.
we'll go from plantation to plantation, from house to house, free the slaves, and fight anyone who tries to stop us.
and we'll make an end to Rome and build a new world where there'll be no more slaves and no more masters!
what is going on up there? - Some plantation is burning the stubble.
there's too much smoke for that.
then there's a forest fire or something. - Tell them to go faster.
Helena! - Faster!
why are you stopping? What is the meaning of this?
whoever you are, you are blocking the path of a citizen of Rome.
move out of the way.
pick up your litters!
pick up your litters!
pick up your litters!
glabrus wishes us to know that while he has not yet encountered the brigands, evidence of their atrocities is everywhere.
we have heard that any slave who does not join their ranks is put to the sword "and any Roman unfortunate enough to encounter them "meets a fate worse than death.
it is with great regret that I report the murders of numerous nobles, "including Cornelius Lucius and his wife Helena.
Helena and Cornelius Lucius?
are you sure? - That is what it says.
the rebels' leader is Spartacus, a gladiator from Thrace.
he has led them to Mount Vesuvius.
it is there that I intend to trap and dispose of them.
rest assured, I am mindful that I carry in my hands "the glory and majesty that is Rome.
Titus Glabrus.
so we're to be equals, are we? - Does that trouble you?
well, I'll do what I can to raise myself but I make no promises.
you'd better. A child needs a father it can look up to.
a child? We're going to have a child?
the slave army is climbing the north wall of the mountain, my Lord.
a little less liberal use of the term "army."
sorry, my Lord. - We'll camp here for tonight.
why don't we push on, my Lord?
cut off the slaves before the mountains?
it's cold, I'm tired and I'm hungry. We'll camp here.
I like it. It's light but it's strong.
Spartacus, we need to talk.
this is a war council. What's a woman doing here?
she has every right.
do women lead you? Is that why Jews live under the Romans?
what's the excuse of the Gauls?
david has news for us.
three cohorts of Roman soldiers are on the road below us.
we're trapped. They're so confident, they haven't built a stockade.
1500 men.
I knew it. I knew this would happen, Thracian, but you insisted.
the people are tired. They need rest.
well, the dead rest forever.
you must have known they would follow us. How do we get off this mountain?
what's your plan?
I don't have one. - You don't have a plan?
from the moment I stood up in the training yard, I've only thought of the next move.
you must have an idea. - Why must I?
I'm no different from any of you. Isn't that the point? That we're all equal?
Yes, but... - So one of you figure it out!
he'll be fine.
they chose you as their leader. - I didn't ask for that.
but you didn't decline it either.
and why should you? You're the only possible choice.
but now the time to lead has come. - When I was alone, all I had to lose was my own life.
now I have the lives of hundreds.
your life.
our child's.
I have faith that you'll find the answer. - Where?
within the soul you say I have? - Yes.
you may not have chosen this moment, Spartacus.
but it seems that this moment has chosen you.
my Lord, have you given the troops permission to camp without building fortifications?
the men are tired and I am tired.
when a Roman army bivouacs it is customary to build a fort.
it's just a handful of rotten slaves facing the same conditions we are.
with women and children and a tenth of our equipment.
a little while ago some of you were asking me if I had a plan.
and the plan is this. We will attack first.
David, hold your men outside the camp until you hear my cry, and then charge in like the dogs of hell.
if these don't hold, I'll kill you myself.
if these don't hold, you won't have to kill me. We'll all be dead.
come on.
you can tell us now.
you are safe here.
I was asleep.
I woke up to screaming.
the sound of screaming.
I was screaming.
their men were everywhere, like ravenous beasts.
and their women followed, feeding like harpies on the wounded.
the killing went on and on.'
our men began to throw down their weapons and plead for their lives but there was no mercy.
how is it that you were spared? - I don't know why they chose me, my Lord.
aII I know is, I was brought before their leader.'
my name is Spartacus. I have a message for your Senate.
tell them that we, the slaves, say the Roman way is corrupt and dead.
we want nothing from you. Leave us alone.
but if you come after us again, we will destroy you all.
by all that Rome holds sacred,
I will see her honor restored.
I will not rest...
until this Spartacus...
hangs, crucified, at the gates of Rome.
move and kill! Move and kill!
again.
move and kill! Move and kill! Faster!
they're looking better. - Against wooden posts.
we'll see what they're like when the target fights back.
Orsino is here. - The Sicilian pirate?
what do we have to talk to him about?
a lot.
the key would help.
Spartacus.
I could tell at once. You have such an air of command about you.
you here to do business or flatter me?
you've done well.
we like to think of it as back wages, long owed.
is it enough to buy us passage out of here?
for yourself? - For all of us.
take us beyond the borders of the empire and they won't follow.
it would require a great many ships and make me many enemies in Rome.
so how many trunks of gold? - At least five more like this.
when we are ready, how do I signal you?
get to the coast and fly this where it can be seen from the sea.
take it.
a gift for our new alliance.
I'll take it as a down payment.
I'd better get some help.
that was a fortune you just gave away.
we can't eat gold, nor will it keep a sharp edge.
Crixus, let's keep this arrangement among ourselves for now.
did you speak to your husband?
about patronage for the House of Batiatus?
you forget your place lanista!
no, I secure it.
you murdered Licinia?
no, your wife did.
something's wrong.
what's happened?
I am with child.
I yet but touch my gift and Crixus goes mad.
now I know whose cock was in her first.
you alone knew of my feelings for him.
and yet you betray me.
where do they take you?
I do not know.
my wife!
tell me what happened to her!
you plan vengeance.
there is but one path.
we kill them all.
the Noble House of Batiatus stands humbled!
humbled by the blessings the gods have seen fit to shower upon us.
and by the presence of the most revered citizens in all of Capua, come to join in celebrating the patronage of Legatus claudius Glaber!
the man himself regrets the duties of the senate prevent his attendance, but he would see us properly addressed, his words delivered by pleasing tongue of trusted wife.
good citizens of Rome's favored sister.
it is with great pleasure that I, Legatus claudius Glaber, bestow upon quintus Lentulus Batiatus my patronage, and all encompassing benefits.
no man in all of Capua is more deserving of such esteemed privilege.
good Batiatus should be held as example to a city mired in shadows and treachery.
the guiding light of his virtuous heart providing illumination in these dark and troubling times.
for this reason and too many others to give voice still yourself.
I lend my full and unconditional support to the honored position of aedile.
Aemilia failed to mention you had mind towards office.
Oh, I admit to none, good Sextus.
until the Legatus broached the subject.
aedile is but a breath below Magistrate.
we should dine, and discuss the matter jurther.
in the hopes that you will share it in the coming days,
I present a gift of blood!
two legends of the arena, to face each other sine missione!
no quarter given!
no mercy shown!
behold, Crixus!
the savage Gaul!
and who shall attempt to tame him?
there can be but one man.
Spartacus!
slayer of the shadow of death!
he is of a form, is he not?
he stands a God.
I have given my answer.
let us finish this.
begin!
you speak of dangerous things.
we live in dangerous times.
many yet hold Crixus our true champion.
count me among them.
I would work the palus.
permission for Spartacus.
have you traded words with Hamilcar?
he is with us.
but Castus and the other gauls refuse to grab cock without Crixus holding their balls.
where does Rhaskos stand?
the same.
our numbers are yet shallow.
we must gain Crixus' support and see them rise.
the fucking mad mans still under lock and key.
how will you turn him to cause if you cannot break words with him?
being champion yet affords privilege.
a way shall present itself. - Answer!
it best "present" fucking soon. - Did I tell you to stand?
Glaber falls to patronage, and the men of influence greet me as a fucking brother!
a day of shining glory.
marred by darkening cloud.
I beg a word, Dominus.
in private.
well spill sour thoughts, and hear them sweetened.
Glaber's mercenaries punish absent cause.
the men suffer at their hand.
it is a burden that must be endured I have no time for such petty concerns.
with respect, every Ludus requires the attention of its lanista.
I seek a loftier title, one far removed from the arena.
you would see your family's heritage a thing of memory?
no.
yet I tire of the dust and drudgery, and I would have my interests in blood and sand overseen by someone with more attentive eyes.
someone who has forever proven loyal.
you would entrust the Ludus to a slave?
a slave, never.
I had thought to make announcement at the celebration, but you force my hand.
my advocate is drawing up papers granting your freedom.
freedom?
no longer shall you be my Doctore.
you will assume the mantle of lanista, and be warmly greeted by your name, oenomaus.
I had thought the news to please.
apologies,
I have heard rumor.
one that has vexed sleep.
well give voice, and dream again.
barca was not granted freedom.
instead he met his end, at your hands.
the rumor is true.
yet absent reasoning.
barca was dispatched to deliver a simple message to Ovidius.
instead he slaughtered the man and his entire fucking family, against command.
I had no choice but to take his life, before the Magistrate discovered the deed and pulled us all to ruin.
and Ashur?
did he aid in this "choice"?
when you are lanista, you shall also be faced with decisions grave of consequence.
and know your measure by how your blade falls.
can you yet feel him move, eager to make entrance into the world?
how do you divine a boy?
because the gods fucking favor us.
Glaber's patronage, access to the upper strata of Capua, the promise of political office.
everything we have bled for, finally within our grasp.
we are truly blessed.
I deliver but glorious news this day, to be met with tempered response!
joy is restrained to lend clear mind to celebration.
Glaber's patronage may have paved road to the elite, but they are of ravenous appetite.
and what meal would you suggest to see them sated?
one that only the house of Batiatus can prepare.
Spartacus, slayer of Theokoles, in a contest to the death.
we have already presented such diversion at Numerius' toga virilis.
Varro was no match for the Champion of Capua.
we must give them what was denied that night.
what all of Capua longs to see, but only a privileged few under our roof may bear witness to.
the Champion of Capua,
Spartacus in a fight for his life against the only man who has ever defeated him.
is this your fucking hope?
that the fallen Gaul is granted opportunity to regain position?
out.
you mistake intent.
I would see Crixus dead, for offenses committed against the House of Batiatus.
then we stand as one in such regard.
Oh your tongue named cause of doubt.
Crixus is the only gladiator to pose threat to Spartacus.
and there is yet political advantage to parading the bringer of rain as I campaign for office.
then we must ensure Spartacus victorious.
and Crixus fades from memory.
that will be all.
patronage comes with unfortunate attachment.
a fact I am well aware of.
I am reminded of the first time you stood before me in this office, a savage in chains.
now you stand as death, made meat and bone.
it was your hand that forged my purpose.
yet it is upon your shoulders the House of Batiatus has been so elevated, and continues to rise.
two days hence we play host to the most influential in Capua, in celebration of patronage.
although a closer look at the slayer of Theokoles be the true draw.
a great honor.
will the men be displayed in the villa?
the Legatus would frown upon such storied tradition.
you and the others will be confined to the square.
and how will our guests have view?
from purchase of the balcony.
no eye will be denied the Champion of Capua!
as he faces his arch enemy in a match to the death!
I am to fight Crixus?
this concerns you?
it is long overdue.
yet there is no honor in taking the life of a caged lion.
I would see him return to training, so he may better thrill the crowd before his end.
you truly have fucking mind for this.
Crixus shall be freed from bond yet only for training.
I would not have the animal run free, lest he again bares teeth.
remove yourself to slumber, and dreams of extracting.
apologies, Dominus.
there is something I crave more than sleep...
you ask the impossible.
the gates to the villa must stand open before I make a move on Batiatus.
you would have me risk all.
and for what?
so that Spartacus may have his revenge?
no.
so that his heart might find a measure of peace.
was she such a woman, your wife.
she was the sun.
never to rise again.
a heavy thing, to be denied its warmth.
I will see the Gate opened.
but I would have exchange...
this is my price.
to feel you inside me.
to know pale shadow of the love that you felt for her...
I would not have wagered the Gaul such a challenge to Spartacus!
you underestimate the man, aemilia.
Crixus was once champion, was he not?
the match is but newly born.
much may yet happen as it matures.
apologies, Domina.
I must gather more wine from the stores.
send another.
I would keep you close, to attend the guests.
you must listen to me...
dominus has ordered my release?
it was Spartacus that moved his hand.
Spartacus?
he desires you at your best...
when you stand before him sine missione.
the gods finally answer my prayers.
had they but answered sooner.
you stand before him tomorrow, as the sun fades.
if it were this very moment, the outcome would not change.
I have made promise to Naevia.
I will not die until I have gained my freedom, and she is in my arms again.
delay talk of freedom, until there are ears that would welcome the sound.
I fear Dominus shall forever be deaf to it.
place your faith to closer quarters.
dominus releases me from the bonds of servitude, to assume mantle as lanista.
it is a title well deserved.
together we will restore honor to this Ludus...
and Naevia to your arms.
Spartacus but stands in your way.
then he shall fall.
a celebration? - Filled with the elite.
their deaths will shatter Capua to chaos.
it'll be days before they regain senses to pursue us.
our plan takes form.
what of Crixus?
you still must find way to broach subject with the fucking Gaul.
it presents itself, as promised.
fuck my ass.
now all that remains is convincing a man that hates you to join your cause.
have you seen task to completion?
my husband's patronage has lifted your celebration beyond the heavens, clouds bursting with honored guests.
Altius and his cousin Gaius? They are a necessity...
and are delivered, as commanded.
Aemilia's husband, sextus?
he's a former Magistrate, yet beloved by many.
his support would all but secure office.
pressing affairs draw him to Rome.
that does not bring comfort Ilithyia.
then perhaps his attendance shall.
he will delay travel, with mind towards your celebration.
how did you turn his attentions?
he favors me.
most husbands do.
your services have been deeply appreciated.
yet more is needed.
in the absence of your honored husband, we would have you address our most noble guests.
just a few words as if fallen from his mouth, extolling the virtues of the House of Batiatus.
I shall compose something appropriate for the occasion.
no need. I've already seen to it.
my hands are no longer my own and now you seize my fucking tongue?
I would not have it flap about, absent direction.
how much longer must I suffer your indignities?
while breath gives life to my command.
as you wish, then.
I know there have been tensions between us.
yet I see no cause for our current arrangement to fall into unpleasantness.
we were such dear friends once.
would you not see it so again?
would that I had power to reverse the sun, and restore the world to its proper place.
rest.
eat.
we resume after midday sun has past.
you move well.
as if lash had never struck.
pain is erased, when inflicted upon others.
I would have you at your best when we face each other.
is that all you'd have from me?
Rhasko speaks of your desires.
what fever grips brain, that Spartacus would think me to band with him?
to risk the lives of my men?
my life?
is there one?
without the woman you love within it?
I've never had stronger reason to live.
I know your heart, Crixus.
I felt the beating of it within my chest once.
then you know I'll fucking survive.
and see Naevia returned to me.
as my wife was returned?
Batiatus ordered her death.
how did you come upon this?
by tongue of his man Aulus, before silencing it forever.
I will see the House of Batiatus fall, and with it the villain's blood upon the earth.
as would I, in your position.
but I am far removed.
my escape would not aid Naevia.
how would I purchase her freedom, or even find her, while being hunted like a dog by the Romans?
join me, and we will find her together.
you know that in another life, you and I may have been as brothers.
but not in this one.
I must win my freedom in the arena.
then we stand in the way of each other's cause.
and both are just.
but if I fall,
I'd have you swear to find Naevia and see her freed.
and I would have word that if you are victorious, one day you will have Batiatus' life.
tomorrow, then.
one of us dies.
I fear it was always fated so.
dominus.
were you able to procure what we need for tomorrow?
good Marcellus was ever helpful.
leave us.
Varro possessed a fine eye.
turn yours towards business.
what has coin extracted from Marcellus?
a solution to most vexing problem.
a few drops in his cup, and fate is sealed.
it must not kill him.
our guests need to believe the match balanced, lest goodwill turn to accusation.
it will but weaken Crixus, allowing Spartacus advantage.
it is a marvel.
that something so slight could topple a legend.
all men fall.
it is but time and method that differ.
see it done.
and in the act, the end of that fucking Gaul.
Crixus moves with deadly purpose.
he gives much better showing against Spartacus than the fool Varro.
poor Varro.
he never stood proper chance, did he?
Crixus, however, threatens to strip the champion of life and title.
indeed.
the Gaul yet surprises.
to the very end.
apologies.
the Noble House of Batiatus stands humbled...
humbled by the fortunes the gods have seen fit to shower upon us...
I should use "blessings" instead.
fortune" has but connotation of coin.
blessings, then.
Oh, Quintus, has this city yet beheld such a man?
your father would be so proud.
the old bastard would have cracked with jealously, to be so eclipsed by unworthy son.
he loved you, Quintus.
yet he never believed in me.
would that he were alive to see the House of Batiatus soaring beneath the flapping of my wings!
our son shall inherit a fucking empire!
an empire now, is it?
eh, the foundations already laid.
today we build upon it!
Spartacus and Crixus!
hated foes, facing each other in death!
the whole of the Republic shall whisper with envy what so privileged few bore witness.
it will be a thing not soon forgotten.
I fear your resolve grows soft.
stone.
I but wish an end to the matter.
and to the man himself.
Ashur already attends to it.
turn thoughts from unfortunate past, and fix on glorious future.
these celebratis can cause hands to tremble.
even most practiced ones.
gratitude.
see nerves calmed.
you'll do well here. I have a feeling of it.
you are allowed to eat from your master's table?
I prepare this as a tribute to the mighty Crixus, before his match against the champion.
may the gods bless it, then.
and give him strength to kill Spartacus.
I would save prayer.
I do not believe Spartacus will fall this day.
I have heard Crixus bested him once in the arena, at the vulcanalia.
what leads you to certainty against similar outcome?
I am certain of many things within these walls.
your beauty among them.
you are needed in the square.
stay to my side do not stray from it, and I will see you beyond these walls.
I do not need you to hold hand.
I only wish your life protected, you fucking cock!
speak louder, and see us all undone.
I would have his fucking whip removed, along with the arm that wields it.
Doctore is an honorable man.
I would not have him dead.
nor any slave.
you fret of shit and piss.
Rhaskos and the others still will not fall to purpose without Crixus.
they will seize the moment.
Crixus is dead, and there stands but one champion.
water?
these celebrations have habit of turning from control.
should they again, remove to a safe place.
none exist.
not since Varro was taken from me by your hand.
and I shall forever despise it for the deed.
in company with the voice that commanded it.
you blame Batiatus. - For many things.
but not this.
it was the boy Numerius who demanded simple sport end in death.
and I should believe a man that would do anything to win?
do not take me a fool.
Ashur prepares meal for Crixus, and speaks of the certainty of your fucking victory.
they corrupt his food?
was it the same for Varro?
is that how you bested him?
I have no hand in this.
were that true, I would still pray Crixus takes your life before he falls.
you betrayed me.
yet I've come to see that the fault is not your own.
you cannot be blamed for being weak.
all men are, when faced with wet opportunity.
I would put it behind us.
all I ask in return is the truth.
tell me Naevia held no meaning for you.
you ask me to speak with false tongue.
what would it conjure for our child?
child? - Seed has at last taken hold.
the gods bless us.
you would divine me as father?
not Dominus?
I feel the blood of a champion, swelling inside me.
I feel you, Crixus.
I have often dreamt, in quiet moments of having a child.
with Naevia.
there is nothing left between us.
I didn't intend for it to end this way.
Crixus begins to fade. - As all memories do.
you're weakened because they have poisoned you!
finish him!
they wish you dead.
I would not have this.
join me, brother.
and we shall see the House of Batiatus fall.
Spartacus.
kill them! Kill them all!
do not be alarmed people. Everything is under control.
please.
he tried to kill you. That fucking animal.
we must calm this! Where are the fucking guards?!
why do you stand there?
gather your men!
I shall see you properly attended.
what is this madness?!
Spartacus shows us the way.
he is a dog without honor!
this house is without honor!
Batiatus ordered his wife dead!
and Domina...She has tainted me, because I spur her fucking heart.
I have given my life to this Ludus!
no, they stole it from you. From all of us.
you asked me to put faith in you.
I ask the same.
honor us all, and see an end of this fucking house.
go.
I save you this time, brother...
friends.
we are perfectly safe inside the villa.
the situation is being attended! Still your hearts.
this very moment my guards are no doubt dealing with these...
they've lost mind!
where the fuck is Ilithyia?
come! Let us away!
seal the doors.
let no one beyond them. - What of the guests?
I am the wife of the Legatus.
seal the fucking doors!
open the doors!
do you recall what I said? In this very room?
that if there was more to Barca's departure, you and I would share words.
Doctore... - Do not fucking speak.
I have seen you ply tongue upon ear, whispering poison.
infecting the honor of this house.
you would kill a defenseless man?
where is the fucking honor in that?
let's see if you recall what I taught you.
when you were yet a man.
the doors...
the doors...
Glaber's men...
sealed the doors...
why would she do such a thing?
mother!
Quintus... - Go!
go!
come.
come here you Roman pussies.
we are all of us dead.
no. We will regain this house.
take Numerius, conceal yourselves.
I know a place.
where do you go?
to my husband.
and the death of Spartacus.
pathetic.
you think this will cause difference?
even if life fades, my hand shall yet be felt.
it plotted the death of Barca.
saw the Magistrate's end.
it even helped force Glaber to patronage.
every beam, every stone in this fucking house bears the mark of Ashur!
it bears only your treachery.
my fucking treachery?
when did you stand forth for Ashur?
when did any of you greet me short of mockery and scorn, fucking cunts!
you received what you deserved!
for Barca and all the others that you have betrayed, your time is done.
would that this were the arena.
your blood would dishonor the sand.
send me on my way, then.
as you would a gladiator.
please, Doctore.
a parting kindness...
you were right.
there is still something between you and I.
where is Naevia?
Where?!
see me and the Dominus out of the villa and I will tell you.
I do not believe you.
please...
our child...
I would rather see it dead, than suckle your breast.
we must conceal ourselves...
was it yours?
that small, little voice.
did it form the words that robbed Varro of his life?
he deserved to die!
he was nothing!
what did you know of the man?
that he would sing to his child, sleeping in his arms?
or kiss the tears from my cheek, when I was of a mood?
did you know the father?
the husband?
he was not a perfect man.
but he was mine.
he was mine!
he was mine!
mine! Mine!
he was mine.
mine... - Aurelia...
be still.
it's done.
look to the girl.
is this not enough?
how many more must die?
I would see but one.
I am your Dominus!
I will have your fucking hearts!
what would you do?
to hold your wife again?
to feel the warmth of her skin?
the taste of her lips?
how many men would you kill?
a hundred?
a thousand?
here stands but one, between you and her.
go to her.
tell her the gods themselves would not keep you apart.
lie!
as you lied to me of my wife.
you were nothing before me!
I gave you everything!
I gave you the means to accept your fate!
and now you are destroyed by it.
I have done this thing because it is just.
blood demands blood.
we have lived and lost, at the whims of our masters for too long.
I would not have it so.
I would not see the passing of a brother for the purpose of sport.
I would not see another heart ripped from chest, or breath forfeit for no cause.
I know not all of you wished this.
yet it is done.
it is done.
your lives are your own.
forge your own path...
or join with us, and together we shall see Rome tremble.
past transgressions
there is but one path. We kill them all.
I'm your Dominus. I will have your fucking hearts!
what would you do?
to hold your wife again?
to feel the warmth of her skin?
the taste of her lips?
how many men would you kill?
I left the deed in Barca's hands.
now you're free.
we have been betrayed by the Beast of fucking Carthage.
you are beneath me.
he is a Magistrate!
one can never know who is plotting violence, can one.
or when they may commit the act.
your wife, she moves ever closer, even as we speak.
my word is kept.
they're reunited.
you will become the greatest Lanistain the republic.
and as such a title we will climb beyond our station, beyond Capua, perhaps to the very steps of the Senate itself.
the fights are particularly entertaining today.
you'd enjoy them more viewed from the pulvinus.
fucking shit eater.
let Vettius preen like a woman.
you'll school him in the ways of men, when Gannicus takes to the sands.
ahh, absent Tullius and the Magistrate to bear witness, what's the fucking purpose?
one man in today's games.
one only, and the seat sneeding to impress stand empty as Vettius' fucking head.
get up! Get up! - Solonius! What news?
Tullius and the Magistrate were delayed with pressing business, but arrive shortly.
as long as the current match continues...
no. Get up!
good day!
get up, get up you fuck...
Vettius begins the match without proper instruction?
proper?
Vettius and the word are of distant relations.
I for one am grateful to be spared his oratory.
the man's voice causes skull to ache.
Gannicus takes position!
now there's a fucking gladiator!
take his fucking face off!
begin!
is your man ever of a serious note?
he'd strip naked and fight with his cock, as long as he wins.
Gannicus, I love you.
what is he doing Quintus...
fucking kill him!
No! Wait just a little while.
Gannicus, do not kill him.
do not kill him.
Noooo!
now they arrive.
a victory regardless.
won in dewy morn.
none of the important matches happen until after the midday sun has passed.
consider yourself fortunate to have a man in the games at all.
good Solonius stands with empty hands.
come then. Let us see them filled with drink.
tell Doctore to see Gannicus back to the ludus.
and properly rewarded for his showing.
can we not stay for the rest of the games?
Vettius' men command the prominent matches.
he has more than enough eyes to watch him stroke his cock.
I would not add ours to the sight.
now you love me, Capua.
dominus orders Gannicus returned to the ludus, and seen to reward.
perhaps one day the pretty little bitch will fight later in the afternoon.
with the rest of the men.
you and your tiny cock best pray that day never come.
save blood for the fucking sands, Gannicus.
what seized fucking brain, releasing your swords in the arena?
I could have killed the man absent an arm and both fucking legs.
hubris. A fine quality.
often possessed by cunts who perish from it.
did you catch the manner of his eye, as he gazed down from the pulvinus?
fucking Vettius.
barely free of his mother's tit, yet carries himself above lanistas of more deserving years.
youth often imagines itself swollen beyond its worth.
time will cure him of the condition, as it does all foolish young men.
time is what he holds in abundance.
the new arena will be finished in but a handful of months.
if we are excluded from the opening games...
Vettius is but shit from a shit town.
how could Tullius and the Magistrate favor a boy from Nola over Capua's own sons?
how do they do it now?
we must prove ourselves in the more important bouts in the old arena and secure position.
to fight later in the day we must first distinguish ourselves against Vettius' men.
yet Vettius' men only fight later in the day.
a vexing conundrum.
Gaia! How come you to Capua without telling me?
I have only this moment returned, with intentions of seeking you out.
do you travel with your husband?
he takes to road no more.
not in this life, at least.
apologies.
none required.
it was his time.
are you occupied?
I am fit to bursting with stories of my adventures.
what man dares stand between women and gossip?
you must tell me everything. Secret no detail.
removed from the ears of men, my lips willingly part...
gaia returns unencumbered.
and in enticing form.
huh, that woman is a force of fucking nature.
one that has blown many an unsuspecting man to his ruin.
you require someone more refined to grace armas our fortunes rise.
have eyes ever beheld such a marvel?
a sight to put the Circus Maximus in Rome to bitter shame.
we will be the ones shamed, if grand ceremony passes absent our gladiators.
we must force advantage, before opportunity slips from grasp.
no, we must be patient.
your father would venture forth with respect and caution.
then a blessing he is not present.
perhaps we should send word to him in Sicilia, petition advice...?
I can already divine content of his reply.
which is why he never rose above his humble station.
fuck patience!
Ahh. Look to Tullius for the way!
he seizes opportunity by the balls while lesser men are left holding cock!
a simple merchant, yet he gives honored counsel to the Magistrate and all the rest of the noble shit eaters of Capua.
truth told, yet at excessive volume.
I would shout his praise to the fucking heavens.
his hands shaped events resulting in the erection of the new arena.
he supplies slaves from the furthest reaches of the Republic to speed its completion.
through the ambitions of Tullius, Capua is elevated.
a lesson to be studied, and reproduced in kind.
is that all?
a simple task then, Batiatus.
between us, we have the greatest gladiators in Capua.
men forged into something beyond their worth.
beyond anything that smug little piss Vettius could ever hope to offer...
perhaps Tullius should not have strayed so far abroad in acquiring his slaves.
pick him up.
you know the rules.
no one breaks the line!
hold!
this is one of good Tullius' slaves?
it is.
I would make purchase. - Purchase?
what's the man's worth? - He is not for sale.
fifty denarii.
what are you doing? - Seizing balls.
the man is barely worth ten.
why would you pay such a sum for a shit Gaul?
shit?
do you not see the promise in his eyes?
the spark smoldering in his breast?
I would give it tender, to ignite in the arena!
add another five to weight your own purse.
lend me twenty denarii.
you pay too much for the man. - The man is nothing.
I pay to gain favor with Tullius.
a waste of coin.
the shit fuck will never be a gladiator.
even the lowest man can rise beyond the heavens, if tempted with the proper reward...
he was well satisfied?
very well.
dominus will be pleased.
not as much as I am.
when are you not so? Especially with yourself?
it is a curse. Being blessed with so much to offer.
and so few interested in sharing it.
see yourselves well scrubbed.
I would not have you smell of goat.
goat? - A dead one.
the smell of victory, brother. - Well earned.
the men all speak of your triumph.
as they will of yours, when you return to the arena.
the crowd will cum in great geysers, drenching the gods gathered to witness
Oenomaus once more upon the sands!
I would have words with my wife.
absent your cock, which has escaped you.
it will be missed.
has Dominus spoken of my return?
I have not heard it.
more than a year has passed since I faced Theokoles.
perhaps Dominus does not intend...
you were the only one to ever stand against the Shadow of Death and live.
Batiatus would be a fool to keep you from the arena.
or I am the fool, for ever dreaming of such a thing.
you are many things. Foolish is not among them.
Batiatus waits but for the perfect day for his champion to retake glory.
is it true? That his thing is large as a horse's?
Diona! - Are you not curious?
is Gannicus' really that big?
where is Domina?
in the triclinium with her guest.
Diona, see the girls bathed. - Yes, Melitta.
it is exciting, speaking of such things, is it not?
I was of a similar age, not so long ago.
I know the giddy enticement of the subject.
yet you and Diona should turn thought from it.
soon enough your flowers will be plucked.
hastening the moment will only result in bruising of the petals.
Yes, Melitta.
and in regards to Gannicus... I've seen bigger.
Oh, you don't seem overly distraught at his passing.
how would you present, after years enduring withered flesh groping at you.
but when you left Capua I thought you madly in love.
I was...with his purse.
sadly his fortunes went dry towards the end.
and did you aid in their evaporation?
what can I say?
I am the glorious sun.
returned to bless loving rays upon favored friend...
Gaia... - I have far too many baubles brought from Rome.
along with other pleasures to be shared...
it suits you.
it would dazzle Venus herself.
I fear I have nothing so exquisite to give in return.
your company is all I ever desire.
and...?
and, I would not refuse the comforts of a well appointed villa, until I manage other arrangements...?
involving a ripe purse?
so many years have passed, yet nothing has changed.
everything has changed, and for the better, by the judging of it.
when last we parted, this house was but a tomb, haunted by the living specter of your husband's father.
and you, forced to smile and cater, bringing him his honeyed wine every evening.
I thought the crusty old bastard would never succumb to the afterlife.
he is not yet so far removed.
merely retired to Sicilia for his health.
so he yet controls the ludus?
no. My husband does.
as his proxy.
was Gannicus well attended then?
he was, Domina.
that Celt with the ridiculously charming smile?
in an amazing display of bravery.
all the hard, rippling men right beneath our feet.
one moistens at the thought.
Gaia! They are but slaves!
please.
in all the years you've called this ludus home, you've never once considered fucking one of them?
the very thought of that turns stomach.
I would never lay with any man besides my husband.
let alone a filthy gladiator.
fucking Gaul.
another sacrifice to the gods of the arena.
Ah, Dagan thinks you of a form, giving odds in your favor.
odds?
do you know where you are, friend?
the House of Batiatus.
trainer of gladiators. - Yes.
you stand among his latest recruits.
bound by pain and blood, together we toil beneath the cruel sting of Doctore's whip.
there were eight of us, when training began.
now we're but three.
four.
and how are we so blessed by a swelling number? Hm?
by what means do you find yourself among such storied company?
my own.
you willingly present ass for fucking?
no, no, young Indus.
do you not see it in his eyes?
this is a man with dreams of blood and glory.
I doubt he'll live to see the test.
test? - Our last trial.
we must all face one of the seasoned men, and demonstrate to the Dominus what we have learned.
live, and receive the Mark of the Brotherhood, proving yourself worthy of the arena.
I will stand upon its sands.
Gammadta mezayyna.
Be-qushya matya maysaeri.
hm, he longs to call you brother, and join you as gladiator.
tell him the feeling is well shared.
Oh, Jupiter's cock!
fifty denarii, for a fucking stone hauler.
coin well spent.
was it?
word surly has reached Tullius' ear, yet none of gratitude return.
fifty denarii!
Solonius was right. I should temper patience, as my father would.
you're not your father.
nor would I have it so.
perhaps tomorrow you will find yourself in the market.
where you have often mentioned Tullius frequents upon a certain hour, overseeing his concerns.
a chance encounter, to gauge reaction?
certain to be favorable.
as I know your reply to my request will be.
give it voice, and see it considered.
I would have Gaia remain with us.
just for a few days, until she can manage other arrangements.
the request does not surprise.
is that a yes?
ask for the moon, and I would wrest it from the heavens.
gaia will be so pleased at your answer.
let her keep company with her wine a moment longer...
has a wife ever had such a husband?
he but honors her and the gods for guiding her to his arms...
Crixus, you lower shield when you thrust.
see it raised, or your fucking brains on the sand.
Yes, Doctore.
a lucky blow.
a blow well struck.
I will not make the same mistake.
good! Again!
I would work the palus. In the shade.
I would not let gaze linger.
Gannicus is a fucking fool, yet one of deadly skill.
he is often rewarded for his victories with wine and cunt.
gain Dominus' favor, and such delights could be yours.
drink and women are not my concern.
Ah, more for me then.
fucking recruits.
smaller and smaller each year.
apologies.
you return to form.
pair with Crixus, and bring him to speed.
dominus.
gratitude.
for your instructions...
lesson one: never drop your fucking guard.
do you lay eyes?
no. Perhaps Tullius did not come today.
he always arrives, and seldom departs before noonday sun.
are you his shadow now, adhered to each footstep?
I but study my subject, as any proper student would in pursuit of knowledge.
Tullius' man.
I seek your master, good Tullius. Would he be within?
Oh...
I wish to express my gratitude for allowing me to purchase his slave Crixus.
the Gaul shows great promise towards the arena.
perhaps you could pass word of my presence...
you owe me a few of those, if you recall.
a costly enterprise, for us both.
that one prays will turn profit.
good Batiatus.
the gods answer...
in mocking tone.
I hoped for occasion to give gratitude for relieving me of that troublesome Gaul.
think nothing of it.
a gesture of respect, for a man deserving of it.
received with all intentions.
yet I fear you have overpaid.
a common mistake, for those with no head towards business.
fifty denarii, minus the ten of the Gaul's actual worth.
well uh...I do not ask for its return.
fair bargain was struck.
fair? Fair?
a clumsy maneuver to gain position for your ill-trained men.
Vettius. - Ill-trained?
any one of my men could best yours fucking blindfolded, you pissy little shit.
listen how the rooster crows.
let us calm ourselves... - You doubt my words? Test them.
request the match in next month's games.
why delay?
let us see it here in the morning, the people to judge who holds the better man.
in the market?
surely the Magistrate would not approve such disruption.
good Tullius has his ear.
the Magistrate could be swayed to allow it...if that is what you wish?
it is. And long past due.
tomorrow then.
a friendly rivalry, well settled.
you press beyond advantage. - No.
I fucking press towards it.
you should have seen young Vettius, so easily goaded into making challenge!
the fucking child!
all men are reduced in years, when faced with superior mind.
sleep will come with difficulty tonight.
it's been ages since I've seen a decent match.
or Tullius.
in the blush of youth, he was forever attempting to slip beneath my robes.
ha. You should have fucking let him.
Tullius has grown to be a man of worth.
one to be emulated and admired.
and who will you choose to impress him?
Vettius' foolishness presents rare opportunity.
the question begs careful consideration...
I have news to lift the heart.
Vettius has made challenge.
the coward finds his cock.
and I would see it shriveled.
my bestman is to meet his dog in the marketplace come morning.
the market? - Ah, detail of no consequence.
my question to you is plain.
is our man prepared for such a vital match?
Yes, Dominus.
I long to honor this house once again.
no, I fear you have mistaken intentions.
I speak of Gannicus.
the question would be better put to Doctore.
leave.
his counsel is always valued, yet he is my father's man.
I seek a more visceral assessment.
you and I practically grew up together in this ludus.
you have witnessed the rise and fall of a dozen champions.
what now does your gut tell you of Gannicus?
is he worthy of the mantle?
I believe it so.
he must truly be, for you to offer support despite your own desires.
I would not give false tongue to gain advantage.
there are few that would stand with you so.
your wife's weekly visit. Two nights hence? - Yes Dominus.
I would see her to your bed tonight as well.
in gratitude for honest thoughts.
dominus.
do the gods ever answer your prayers?
they often reveal their leanings, though not in words.
much like my husband.
dominus summoned me.
to ask of Gannicus.
he has chosen him as champion, he is to face Vettius' man in the marketplace tomorrow.
and this is why you sulk?
the streets are no place for the mighty Oenomaus to make his return.
the arena will be home to your triumphs, when the time comes.
and I will be there to witness it...
I will dream of your touch.
as I dream of yours every night.
my cock rages on, my cock rages on...
Gannicus! - Brother!
brother come, drink, join me! - Lower voice!
if the Guards were to hear you... - The guards have already passed.
and were well plied with wine to keep nose from fucking business.
tomorrow you fight for the honor of this ludus.
now is not the time for drink. Every night is time for drink.
for the morning sun may greet you with your last fucking day.
fall to your bed.
or risk steeper plummet against Vettius' man.
words of wisdom, well received, well, well, received.
it should be you tomorrow.
where is good Vettius? Is he among you?
or did he come to sense, and remain within the warm safety of his bed?
Ah! There he stands!
fresh and young as a newborn calf!
the fool at last shows himself.
we had begun to fret on your arrival.
although I see you arrive with unexpected gift...
it has been too long, Gaia.
and grows longer still.
apologies for my delay.
I had much difficulty in the choosing of a man.
an imposing task, when each among my stable stands a titan!
perhaps good Vettius should have taken more time with the choosing of his own.
words fall from your mouth, as shit from ass.
let us not become mired in base exchange.
we are gathered this glorious day to witness honorable contest between respected rivals.
clear space!
the years have favored Tullius.
and his purse.
a brawl in the streets. Where is the honor in such a thing?
fuck honor.
this is business.
gratitude to Magistrate Sextus
the event turns larger than expected.
for allowing such thrilling event - Your mad schemes may yet bear fruit.
enough for both of us to feast upon.
in the streets of the great city of Capua!
Batiatus. Present your man.
in honor of the Magistrate, esteemed Tullius, and the good people of Capua...
I give you the fearless Gaul ever to take up arms in the arena!
slayer of beasts!
conqueror of giants!
behold Gannicus!
champion of the House of Batiatus!
a fine choice.
Vettius. Present your man.
I have no tongue for overripe embellishment.
nor is it required.
Otho! Stand forth!
your day finally comes. - And yours ends.
gratitude to Batiatus and Vettius.
now, let us judge who stands the better house!
apologies, Magistrate.
there appears to be something missing.
where is your man's blindfold?
blindfold? What the fuck...
that was your boast, was it not?
that your gladiator could best any of my men absent sight...?
you did voice such challenge.
a simple figure of speech, not meant to be...Good Tullius...
if Batiatus does not wish to honor terms, he should remove himself.
with tail between legs.
Doctore.
come...
the task should not be that difficult.
I need only direct my blades towards the smell of shit.
Gannicus. Ever the fool.
you are going to allow this, Quintus?
the choice has been removed from my hands.
begin!
Yes!
how thrilling.
I have never seen such a thing.
for good reason.
a noble attempt.
to be remembered only in its failing.
get up!
Yes!
fucking kill him!
Yes!
have you ever fucking seen the like?
perhaps good Vettius should pit a man less prone to death against the mighty Gannicus!
an impressive display, Batiatus.
one not soon forgotten.
Gannicus is truly a wonder.
one deserving more prominent position in the games.
you gaze upon my very thoughts.
commitments beckon.
join me at Nestor's shop after the market closes, and we shall discuss your man at length.
only mad Gannicus could win contest fucking blindfolded!
barca could do the same!
and I would kill you for being a fool.
Auctus speaks truth.
facing Vettius' man absent sight was beyond foolish.
the gods must have taken pity on your addled brain.
the gods had naught to do with it.
Otho he grunts like a stuck pig before each attack.
his squeals they gave way position!
your victory lifts the heart.
you will not be rid of Gannicus so easily brother.
dominus he rewards me with all the wine that I can drink and I would share it with my brothers!
those that bear the mark.
one day.
Gannicus' victory forges path to greater glory.
with Tullius' support, we can finally gain proper position in games!
maybe a place in the opening ceremony of the new arena.
after such a magnificent showing,
I have no doubt Gannicus will be offered a place in the primus.
Primus...
Yeah, I favor the fucking sound of that.
expect late return.
I would seek out Solonius afterwards, to discuss extending advantage to his house as well.
send Tullius my regards.
and gauge his response in remembering me.
how could he fucking forget you.
it staggers mind, the change in him.
change? - You know my meaning.
he always seemed so...demure and cowed.
now he positively burns.
he has always done so.
his light was merely muted by the shadow of his father.
the man could turn day to night with disapproving frown.
he never cared much for me.
or, I suspect, anything that smacked of enjoyment...
and what might this be?
more gifts from Rome.
the finest opium, carried from Cyprus.
I have not partaken in many years.
my husband... - Will be gone most of the night...
good Batiatus.
word of Gannicus' victory has spread throughout the city.
his name- and yours- fall from every mouth.
may they always find the taste pleasing.
everyone clamors to see your man again.
with exception of poor Vettius.
he is fit for seizure from the ordeal.
unfortunate.
that he could not provide more worthy opponent.
yet his stock is well known to be of inferior quality, as is the boy himself.
the manner in which he tends the ludus.
the child has no fucking talent for it.
you surprise me, Batiatus.
your disposition towards business is much more aggressive than your father's.
we are of diverging temperament. And desires.
how does he fare in Sicilia?
the clime is more agreeable to various conditions brought about by the passing of the years.
how did the Magistrate take to Gannicus' display?
ignited by it, as was the crowd.
he even broached subject of retaining the man.
for the opening games of the new arena.
Gannicus in the opening games?
if you could aid in such a thing, I would forever be in your debt.
it merely requires a word in the proper ear.
all that remains is to agree upon a price.
Ah, of course I would be happy to see coin to your hand in exchange for assistance.
what, err, sum did you have in mind?
you misunderstand, Batiatus.
I do not offer a broker arrangement. I offer to purchase your man.
purchase? But why would you want a gladiator? You're not a lanista.
Jupiter's cock, no.
yet I have many vested interests.
in shipping. Goods and services. This very shop.
and young Vettius' ludus.
look at the little fuck now. About to shit himself.
still your tongue.
the grownups are talking.
two hundred denarii.
a generous offer.
in respect of your father.
apologies.
I would not part with the man.
I allowed you to purchase one of my slaves.
yet now you deny me the same opportunity?
Gannicus is not for sale.
everything is for sale, Batiatus.
the question is but price.
I make fair offer.
and you produce cock to piss on me.
do you know what that feels like, Batiatus?
reconsider your answer.
or be excluded from the games forever.
join our FRS and have fun! QQ Group No. 37304379
have eyes ever beheld such a marvel?
now there's a fucking gladiator!
begin. - Fucking shit eater.
we will be the ones shamed, if grand ceremony passes absent our gladiators.
to Tullius for the way!
good Batiatus.
his hands shaped erection of the new arena.
he supplies slaves from the furthest reaches of the Republic to speed its completion.
Crixus! - I would make purchase.
pay to gain favor with Tullius.
a clumsy maneuver to gain position for your ill-trained men.
any one of my men could best yours fucking blindfolded, you pissy little shit.
I offer to purchase your man.
Gannicus is not for sale.
I allowed you to purchase one of my slaves.
yet now you deny me the same opportunity?
reconsider your answer.
or be excluded from the games forever.
reconsider your answer.
or be excluded from the games forever.
this is not the time. Let us not broach subject again.
Quintus why are you from bed?
the Medicus gave plain instruction you are to rest.
a week upon my back sees advice well heeded.
more and even my cock will cease knowing how to stand.
his spirit returns.
I am not a babe new dropped from fucking womb.
see meat and wine set out. - Yes, Domina.
I always follow the wine.
your wounds, they are less gruesome.
has she not yet found some fool's bed to fall to yet?
or is her sole intent in Capua to drink us dry?
she has been of great comfort.
and seeks the word for herself.
who do you think dried my tears, when my husband was returned to me, bloodied and broken?
his life in question?
I live.
and continue thoughts towards doing so.
I would not see my injuries wound you as well.
Oh, it is a balm, to see you on your feet.
you're going to speak to the magistrate about this?
towards what end?
he is a puppet.
what redress would Sextus offer, when the man who grieved me holds his strings?
Tullius has always been a favored son of Capua.
I can not believe he would be capable of doing such a thing.
a man of ambition is capable of anything.
my dealings with the magistrate take precedence tomorrow.
I would have you greet Varus in my stead.
the honor would be mine. The man pisses wine and shits gold.
varus is but a stream leading to an ocean of coin.
one I would see break wave upon our steps.
he comes to choose men?
for the games of the Vinalia, to ensure his vines bear fruit in the coming year.
I will present only our finest gladiators.
I would enrich our stock, and offer him Gannicus as well.
this had best be the Falernian promised.
if I find you've served your usual swill, we will have words.
put mind to ease.
note sun and mountains etched in the amphora, proof of its authenticity.
Yes, of course.
I was unaware you had an appreciation for such tastes, Solonius.
a gift for a friend recovering from unfortunate injury.
please.
allow me.
generous, but unnecessary.
I believe it is.
I've done nothing to deserve it.
a matter shortly to be rectified.
come, I would discuss message to be delivered with our gift.
better received from your tongue than mine.
the Gaul is quite the beast.
what name does he take?
apologies, I do not know.
his name is Crixus.
he trains in the style of Murmillo.
you have an interest in the games.
or does it land only upon the men who play them?
so easily made to blush.
a sign of tragic inexperience.
I have not turned such a color since before you were born.
how I envy your youth.
and all the wonders you have yet to discover.
do not be afraid to pursue every delight this world has to offer.
Melitta cautions patience.
plucking flowers too quickly will bruise the petals.
words from a mouth that has only known her husband's cock.
you charge like a crazed goat, absent thought.
when faced with stronger opponent, draw him to you, then counter.
again.
finally words find way through your thick skull.
join the recruits, continue your training.
Yes, Doctore.
the mighty Gaul returns.
or is it his corpse, too stubborn to fall to grass?
Ah, Dagan expresses his joy at finding you yet among us.
we feared you fated for the mines, with all the sand you have been eating.
an acquired taste.
come, I should serve you some more.
you've done well with the man.
Crixus is undisciplined, but not without promise.
brings to thought a wild fuck I schooled, when we yet called Batiatus' father Dominus.
I yet feel the sting of your lessons.
their knowledge now bestowed upon simple recruits.
I will seek word with Batiatus, towards your return to the arena.
gratitude, Doctore... Close fucking mouth.
I but seek not to have wasted long years of pulling your head from your ass.
Doctore.
I require a more worthy opponent.
perhaps if Oenomaus is finished sipping drink?
instruct Gannicus in the ways of a true champion.
do you recall Magnetius, when he fought Trux of the East?
a glorious victory.
Ah, for my father.
my father's champions. My grandfather's champions.
the storied history of the house of Batiatus.
with new chapters yet to be added.
etched upon what tablet?
I'm excluded from the games, or has such details slipped memory's grasp?
apologies. I did not mean...
fault is mine for bearing teeth at trusted friend.
gratitude for the gift.
it's well received.
I claim only its delivery.
he's willing to see his bid for Gannicus doubled.
if accepted, he will grant your men strong position in the upcoming games of the Vinalia.
this wine is from Tullius?
I did not seek him out.
he approached me in the marketplace, expressing regret that his business with you turned to excess.
he even paid for the wine that I'd selected for you.
a gesture of goodwill.
do you see these marks upon me?
we must consider... - Do you fucking see them?!
I see them. - That is the man's true gesture, the only to be considered.
you counsel to suck the cock that pisses on me!
I merely counsel reason, as your father would.
to what purpose?
he brings word and gift from Tullius, who yet seeks Gannicus to swell his ranks.
after what he fucking did to you?
let us sweep aside such petty grievances in service of reason and reward, he offers twice the sum refused.
and what, I wonder, does good Solonius receive for convincing me to spread cheeks and accept deeper ramming?
I would share equal position in the games.
you are in remarkable condition, to claim my reflection.
our fates move towards similar end, despite outward appearance.
refuse Tullius' offer, and I shall join you in exclusion from the arena.
he makes such a threat?
with exacting clarity.
I did not mean to see you burdened so.
I will think upon the matter.
Tullius requires answer.
I require a fucking moment!
he wishes to present your man to Quintilius Varus tomorrow.
Varus? He comes to Capua?
Vettius is to meet him as he enters the city midday.
I held his acquaintance in Rome, a man of great influence.
and coin.
you would beg for Tullius' scraps?
without them, I fear we shall both go hungry.
think upon it.
and know that I stand with you, whatever your decision.
I have witnessed greater spine within a snail.
what are your thoughts?
Doctore!
send that fucking man to the mines!
do it!
no, Doctore!
no, please! Doctore!
Dominus...
we do not surrender in this fucking house!
I'll see these walls fall to ruin before Missio is given!
it appears decision is made.
Gannicus will one day stand the champion of Capua.
for the house of Batiatus.
how do we manage such honor, if excluded from the games?
Tullius but brokers interest.
if a man of wealth and position such as Varus requested my men, even he would be unable to refuse.
he meets with Vettius.
you expect that fucking child to make introduction?
no, I expect him to bleed, as I rip Varus from his grasp.
Halt!
rest!
eat!
Ah, your numbers shrink like frightened cock.
I would laugh as well
a man is condemned to the mines, and they all fucking jest?
if it were a brother lost, you would find the mood solemn.
we must earn the fucking mark to gain respect.
or follow Indus to his fate.
I will not die a faceless slave, forgotten by history.
we shall rise together.
one day all the Republic will marvel at the sight of us.
fucking savages.
they pissed in the porridge.
Ah, I have had my fill.
Oh, finally, someone who can hold their wine!
I did not realize we were for company.
he leaves presently.
Oh please, after we have finished the jug.
the last of my spoils to be shared with dearest of friends.
replace dearest with only, and sentiment becomes truth.
hum, subtle argument, who was the better man as we sparred today?
my husband. - Ha!
you are swayed by the title of wife.
one day we shall face each other upon the sand, and have true decision.
what would really happen?
if you had to face each other, sine missione?
no quarter given, no mercy shown?
I would give your husband a glorious death.
you joke of killing a man you love.
when someday you may be asked to.
Oh, you two are a perfect match, are you not.
both always fretting about what tomorrow may bring.
we are slaves.
burden of choice and conscience equally removed.
we are truly free when we fight.
or when we fuck which I shall leave to do presently.
it is you and my husband who are of a perfect match.
one hides true thought in brooding silence.
the other in boastful jest, meant to hold all at a fair distance.
Melitta... - I do not hold you at a distance.
you are my two favorite women in this world.
and what happens brave Gannicus, when presented with circumstance you cannot laugh or fight your way clear of?
well, I may have to fuck my way clear of it.
good night!
never come up upon my back.
apologies.
I seek only advice for coming days.
heed Oenomaus' instruction, you will earn your brand.
till then, stay from sight.
it is not the brand that concerns me.
it is becoming champion.
there is only one way to become champion.
never fucking lose.
see Barca readied.
he is to accompany me into the city.
another stunt in the market?
does my last bodyguard's death fucking elude?
barca is to serve as such? He is a gladiator, not...
he is whatever I fucking say.
have the Syrians also prepared.
absent shackles and clothed for the streets.
Ashur and Dagan, what use do you see them to?
none of your concern.
with respect, Dominus, I am the Doctore.
the men are my only concern.
a duty awarded you by my father.
a man who would not condemn a promising recruit to the mines out of a mood.
recruits, gladiators, even you are but slaves.
mine to command, despite my fucking moods.
you truly believe this man ripe with potential?
indus will never be champion, but he is not without skill.
have him loaded with the Syrians.
I will give him opportunity to prove his worth.
dominus.
has Venus herself ever appeared in such rare form?
you blaspheme.
frequently and with great relish.
where is Gaia? The appointed hour is upon us.
she stands ready.
Quintus... - Do not give voice to doubt.
we are committed, and will see this to its end.
you each know your parts.
see this act to successful completion, and earn the mark of the brotherhood.
without proving ourselves in the test?
this is your test.
but turn thoughts toward escape or fail in your charge, and I will have you parted from your cocks and crucified.
you're clear to your purpose?
Yes, Dominus.
take up your positions, and await my signal.
I do not trust the Syrians.
if this does not end in our favor, they will appear as common thieves.
absent my fucking mark upon arm.
Oh, this will never work.
of course it will, look at you.
what man or otherwise, could resist such charms?
Oh, still fluttering heart.
I would not deny myself such pleasures if presented again, yet necessities shift attention to cock.
and a golden one at that.
you set eyes towards Varus?
he is without wife, last I heard.
we do this to aid my husband, not to secure one of your own...
he arrives.
let us end discussion and set mind to purpose.
good Vettius! Thank the gods I have found you.
your gratitude is misplaced. I do not know you.
I am Varus' man.
he sends word of pressing desire to see the new arena, before retiring to business.
the arena? No.
I am of clear instruction to meet him as he enters the city.
of course... Apologies.
I will deliver word of your refusal.
wait.
varus is honored guest.
as such, I am but humble servant.
it's quicker I think, if we pass through here.
apologies, for the inconvenience.
dominus will be most pleased that you've accompanied me.
you've turned yourself about.
this is not the direction of the fucking arena.
no.
it is not.
we are to leave this one alive, you simple fuck!
Aved-leh.
our charge is met.
I will not see the mines.
I fear they would have been a blessing.
apologies, brother. Vettius saw your face.
dominus gave instruction.
where the fuck is Vettius?
it is you! - Gaia!
what finds you in such horrid climes?
a visit to see dearest friend.
lucretia and her husband Batiatus are the saving grace of this ill-bred town.
this is Quintilius Varus, an acquaintance of my late husband.
his wine is the toast of Rome.
your tongue has lost none of its silver.
it is an honor.
and what good fortune blesses Capua with your presence?
I come to choose gladiators for the Vinalia.
or would if young Vettius ever deigns to appear.
we shall entertain you with diverting conversation while you wait.
I fear it shall be tragically one sided.
the sun threatens to bake me senseless.
we can not have such esteemed guest expire so, can we?
well, my husband's villa is but a little ways from here.
you'd be more than welcome... - Gratitude.
but I would seek Vettius out, and put foot to ass for his delay.
Lucretia's slaves know the man.
it would be just as easy for them to bring him to her villa when discovered.
it would give us much needed pause to reacquaint ourselves.
well, it would be ungrateful, to refuse such kind offering.
your villa, then.
my husband will be most pleased to receive you.
what good fortune to run into you...
the last time I was graced with Gaia's presence was at some sober, airless affair, hosted by um, oh, what was the man's name?
Atticus. - Atticus! Yes!
desiccated specimen.
I fear without Gaia's charms, pronounced boredom would have carried me to the afterlife that very night.
Oh, my husband returns.
fetch more wine.
Lucretia, apologies.
I did not realize we were to entertain.
an unexpected pleasure, chanced upon in the city.
Quintilius varus, an old friend from rome.
ahh, the name is not unfamiliar. You honor us with your presence.
the honor is mine, to fall upon such arm hospitality.
Ah, forgive unsightly countenance.
a mount, long trusted, threw me from purchase.
one must be cautious, when dealing with such animals.
Yeah, a lesson painfully learned.
what finds you so far from Rome?
games, of the vinalia.
you come to choose men?
I have many fine offerings. Gannicus, in particular...
apologies... you are a lanista?
uh, he has already set purpose towards vettius' men.
ahh, well, fill cup and strike ill-spoken words from mind.
thing of no concern.
Vettius will see you well attended.
at considerable savings.
do I appear so light of purse, to require such?
you have never been so taken with the games.
I only assumed you would not waste excessive coin towards them.
true yet the gods must be properly honored.
and vettius remains annoyingly absent.
your men.
how stand they in comparison to the boy's?
well, I would not speak ill of a brother lanista.
you are too modest.
Vettius offers shit.
I was told by good Tullius that his stable is well stocked.
the boy chooses gladiators as carelessly as his wine.
high quantity, of the lowest quality.
come let us sample a finer vintage.
please.
Doctore!
gladiators, form up!
present yourselves!
did I not tell you?
the finest gladiators in all of Capua.
hmm
a demonstration, perhaps?
of course.
Gannicus! Step forward.
behold! My finest champion!
no man stands his equal.
and who would you have face this god of the arena?
barca perhaps or oenomaus, - Who fought so bravely... - How about the gaul?
who would not marvel at seeing such a creature locked in mortal embrace.
apologies the man does not yet bear the mark of the brotherhood.
yet he is presented.
I fear such a match would be overly brief.
a blessing, considering the heat.
well, let us move to it then.
step forward!
a fucking jest.
the house of batiatus is humbled by the attentions of quintilius varus.
let us show him they are not unwarranted.
apologies, are they to use those little wooden sticks?
well, it is the tradition, when blood is not the purpose.
so they are to fight as children, not men?
why, I would not see you to such an impression.
Doctore!
have wood give way to steel.
the gods have heard you.
they present opportunity to become champion.
begin!
Oenomaus has trained you well.
yet you are pale imitation of the man.
you lie! I did no such thing!
a fine attempt.
have there ever before been such a demonstration?
what say you, good Varus?
should the gaul live or die?
well, gaia chose the man, let the choice be hers.
let him live.
he may yet find his use.
what of my man Gannicus, did you find him to your liking?
the man is weary from his travels.
let us not press him with further business.
come see yourself inside, to uh,
sample other indulgences.
some delights from cyprus, perhaps?
a region I'm most fond of.
as I recall.
what the fuck are you doing?
what I do best.
varus is a man of particular appetites which grow strong under influence of wine and opium.
see your man Gannicus oiled and scented,
to be presented as the hour passes.
I risk all to lure varus to our house,
only to find I am no longer the fucking master of it...
she knows the man more intimately than we do.
we must lend her our trust.
let us pray it is not soiled upon return.
see Gannicus prepared and brought up to the villa.
and what will be required of him?
whatever I fucking desire.
Ashur and Dagan returned absent indus.
did he not prove himself?
he did, and was well rewarded.
and the Syrians, are they to be rewarded as well?
with the mark of the brotherhood.
the mark?
without proving themselves in the test?
they proved themselves in my test.
see it done.
your father would never approve... - I am not my fucking father!
a fact well known.
see to Gannicus. Brand the fucking Syrians.
and inform Oenomaus that he is to assume mantle of Doctore.
Dominus...
you are a relic, as is my father.
shadows from the past,
soon to fade from memory.
see to Gannicus.
see how it caresses the wine.
is there anything so enticing?
I have seen its rival.
this house indeed offers many pleasures.
with more yet to be presented.
pleasing this man must now become your sole fucking purpose.
please him? In what manner?
I have had my fill of being questioned by slaves.
if Varus wishes you to suck his cock dry,
you will savor every drop.
are we of a singular mind?
dominus.
in honor of distinguished guest,
I present my finest man for you personal viewing.
behold Gannicus.
yours to command.
you are quite the lanista, Batiatus.
I have never been so well plied towards aid of a sale.
this is not about business.
this is how they live!
they grab life and squeeze until the juice flows.
how do you always come by such marvelous acquaintance?
it is a gift.
one among many
set before me.
is he not of a form, our champion?
I have not seen his like.
and more than a few have stood before me.
the man stands as a god.
the arena his olympus.
he once thrust his blade so deep into his opponent's breast,
that tears turned to blood.
I am not impressed... by inflated tales.
my interests are grounded in what I can see,
what I can touch.
now that is... impressive.
are you as skilled in its use as you are with a sword?
I would have demonstration.
the man is yours,
we will lend privacy.
you mistake intent.
no I have had too much wine and other pleasures
for such rough exertion.
no, I would prefer a feast of the eyes.
have him fuck this one,
and I shall watch.
apologies...
for what?
is she not a slave?
she is.
and will do as commanded.
welcome to the fucking brotherhood.
why are we gathered?
the Syrians receive the mark.
absent the test?
wait, are we not to recite the oath?
I will not see more shit heaped upon sacred rites.
you may bear the mark but don't ever think yourself a gladiator,
you little cunt.
Doctore!
do not fucking speak to me in such tone!
apologies...
you believe yourself my equal, Oenomaus?
no, doctore.
bring fucking swords!
now, let us see if you have learned all i have to teach.
remove her dress.
is that what I taught you, Oenomaus?
Doctore... - How to turn upon heel?
Doctore!
doctore, stop!
fight me you coward!
Melitta I... - See it done.
prove yourself worthy, Oenomaus.
I taught you well.
the man is dead?
I did not want it.
he forced me to fight.
and I do not know the reason for his anger toward me.
the reason falls to my own tongue.
earlier I revealed intent of raising you to position of Doctore.
I am not to return to the arena?
you are beyond such things now,
proven by your training of crixus.
let us put the past behind us, and look to future glories.
my wife.
I know it is not our time, but I would ask to see her.
I will send her to you when she has finished her duties.
gratitude.
apologies the demands of a lanista seldom offer respite.
Oh, none required.
this night has been filled with unexpected joys.
you remain in Capua?
until more adventurous opportunities present themselves.
I'll take my leave then with promise of further discourse.
Oh, your man, Gannicus.
I would see him perform again.
in the primus of my games.
and you shall have him.
terms to be discussed.
gratitude for your hospitality.
it will not soon be forgotten.
primus!
did I not tell you I knew the man?
may the gods strike me for entertaining doubt.
you were magnificant!
did i not tell you!
you have elevated this house.
yet speak of how we came by such honor,
and see brotherhood shattered and a husband lost.
I have done a terrible thing.
we do what we must in this house.
you'll become the greatest lanista in the republic.
have you.
I would make purchase.
you paid too much for the man.
the man is nothing, I paid to gain favor.
if a man of wealth and position such as Varus requested my men.
he meets with Vettius.
I expect him to bleed, as I rip Varus from his grasp.
is he not of a form, our champion?
I would have demonstration.
have him fuck this one.
your father would never
I am not my fuckin' father!
fact well known!
inform Oenomaus, that he is to assum mantel of Doctore.
prove yourself worthy Oenomaus.
I would see him perform again, in the primus of my games.
we have won many victories in the arena.
sent many an unworthy opponent to the afterlife.
yet self important men hold us to lesser matches of the morning, absent both eyes and prominence.
such time has found its end!
two days hence, our champion will take to the sands to face another of Vettius' shit-eating dogs.
not in the streets, but in the fucking primu
not in the streets, but in the fucking primus!
behold the champion whose recent performance inspired good Varus to return the House of Batiatus to proper position!
behold, Gannicus!
an inspired performance, indeed.
one not to be repeated.
a true god of the arena!
a man to be admired and emulated!
this is but glorious beginning!
soon you will litter the sands with the blood and bone of all who present challenge!
instructed in the ways of death and glory by a former champion!
one of our very own!
I give you Oenomaus!
no longer to hold that name!
no longer a gladiator!
now and forever, to be revered as your Doctore!
this has been wielded with pride by each before you, since the time of my grandfather.
bestowed only on the most loyal and honorable of men.
your will. My hands.
the primus.
to gain such position, Varus must truly have been impressed with your prowess.
as am I.
it was nothing. - It is a great honor.
for yourself, and this ludus.
both of you bring honor to this ludus.
each in his own way.
did you note how he could scarce meet my eye?
he must now heed my commands, and does not embrace it.
will the other men share sentiment towards my "honored" position?
it is his position that stirs troubled thoughts.
he sets mind to the primus.
as you must to training the men.
I know this is not what you wished for.
and yet here I stand.
elevated.
as you deserve.
for taking a life?
for betraying hand that forged the man before you?
there was no betrayal in what you did.
some acts cannot be avoided, when stripped of choice.
now turn thoughts from unfortunate past.
we must look towards days to come, and embrace them.
pair with Crixus.
the rest of you...
continue training.
at last, the gods remove cock from fucking ass!
the House of Batiatus...no...
the House of Quintus Lentulus Batiatus rises to the fucking heavens!
soon my champions will be carved in stone, towering above all who came before.
and Gannicus will be the first of them after victory in the fucking primus.
the position was not gained absent aid.
I offered naught but introduction.
and a few selective words of suggestion...
you could wile the Goddess Laverna herself!
your place in this will not pass without much fucking gratitude.
the kind I favor most...
has a man ever been so blessed?
Father...?
gather yourself.
I would have words.
I leave this house in your care, and this is what greets me upon return?
I was not expecting your arrival.
am I to announce myself to the walls that I own?
of course not. Yet if I had known of your return from Sicilia...
the knowledge would have produced what result? Huh?
flowers and scented oils laid to meet me, masking sight of a son gone to shit?
I but celebrate.
upon what cause?
angering Tullius with refusal of reasonable offer?
your exclusion from the games?
how do you come by that?
I am old, Quintus.
not dead.
there are still those in Capua that hold my name in regard, and would see me well informed.
good Solonius counted among them.
he sent word of his concerns regarding your dealings with Tullius.
the man is seized by unnecessary worry.
your face suggests otherwise.
a minor disagreement.
nothing with a man such as Tullius is ever minor.
a fact obvious to the simplest of minds.
then it is a blessing a greater one than mine has arrived.
my frustration is more with myself.
you never wished for this.
the ludus, gladiators, the blood, the sand.
your eyes were always towards the horizon, to glories and triumphs forever out of reach of a common lanista.
and yet here I stand. A lanista.
like my father.
not like him at all.
you have never been able to look into the eyes of a man, and gauge his true heart.
only days past, I looked into the eyes of Quintilius Varus.
and "gauged" way to secure the primus in his games.
varus has never employed a lanista not blessed by Tullius.
why now break tradition?
because I possess what Tullius does not. Gannicus.
the man is a jest, inciting more laughter than awe.
and now I find him desired by half of Rome?
much has changed in your absence.
and much has remained the same.
I would review my men, and see how they have fared, denied proper guidance.
have feast prepared as instructed.
and send to market for an amphora of mulsum. - Yes, Domina.
the highest quality, not that shit from Flavus.
again with the honeyed wine.
does the corpse drink nothing else?
lower your fucking voice.
the man has severed you from moorings.
he is the paterfamilias!
one word dropped from his tongue could see us both to the streets.
we must be beyond reproach, or fall to ruin.
very well.
I will be a vision of demure obedience and propriety.
on the outside, at least.
we are honored by your return to Capua, father.
I am certain your heart swells.
Oh, the clime of Sicilia has most certainly restored health.
perhaps you do not recall me.
Gaia, a dear friend of...
the memory of you has not yet faded.
we must prove this fucking house in order.
and prompt decision for his quick return to Sicilia.
withered old fuck.
eat, brothers! You bear the mark now.
savor the taste of victory!
see how they look at us as one of their own
our piss once again finds its way to their mouths!
as if sucked from our cocks!
Argh!
we bear the fucking mark!
received absent the test.
a fucking goat may bear the mark.
it does not make him a brother.
what does he say?
we are unworthy of the mark
we will see smile removed soon enough
what did he say? Fucked if I know.
he wants some more.
you should not eat with lower men.
you are Doctore now.
a title I did not seek.
I would not have events absent my control come between us.
nor would I.
Ah, greetings.
you assume mantle of Doctore?
after unfortunate death of his predecessor.
I chose Oenomaus as replacement, knowing that he...
gather your food and let us retire to your cell.
I would exchange stories of the passing years, old friend.
dominus.
the way they fawn... over him!
falling to knee to lick his fucking ass!
he takes over my house. My gladiators. My fucking bed!
did he give voice toward length of stay?
he gives voice only towards considerable faults of un-fucking-worthy son.
leave.
I secure the primus, and he acts as if I shit upon the name Batiatus.
Oh, you raise it, beyond anything he can imagine.
he will see this, and bitter tongue will turn to praise.
he would sooner bite it off, than have it betray him so.
I had forgotten the feeling.
this sudden abyss, as he sets disapproving eye upon me.
come.
you will not need endure his presence long.
his health is fled in these climes before.
should he fail to realize that his house-- his name-- is in proper hands, a forced return to Sicilia will eventually arise.
I would see him removed sooner.
your return lifts the heart, Dominus.
only for those who yet possess one.
gratitude.
attend!
pair up!
Crixus, spar with Barca.
Auctus... work the palus until Gannicus joins us.
this one is too small!
I would have something the size of a man!
do as your Doctore commands.
Yes, Dominus.
come. Let us see what is between your legs.
the Gaul winces from spear...
as he would from my cock!
is my long, hard weapon too much for you, little man?
I am without lesson against it.
but your instructions are well received.
fucking cock eaters
think themselves gods
we will show Barca and Auctus they are but men
apologies.
you rise earlier than expected.
I rise at proper hour.
an attribute neither you nor your man Gannicus seem to share.
harsh words will find the man's ear.
uh, it could be shouted yet ignored.
Gannicus is no champion.
I would promote Auctus or half a dozen men in his place.
a matter we disagree on.
one of many.
what man spars with Barca?
Crixus, a fierce Gaul of worthy stock.
I recall name from the ledger.
a sampling of exceeding cost.
the man will earn the mark, and see investment well returned.
Doctore! Bring Crixus up!
my father would have closer inspection
no. Continue training.
we are to town for necessary business.
I will have Barca prepared as an escort.
barca is a gladiator.
trained to wield weapon in the arena, not be yours in the street. Now come.
your late rise already threatens the appointed hour.
I would have you silent.
while I attempt repair of damaged relation.
good to lay eyes, old friend.
your experience in delicate matters of business has been sorely missed.
to be rectified presently.
come, sit.
you recall my associate,
Oh, you were but a child last I knew.
how the years flee from us.
how fares your father?
dead. - Oh. Apologies.
how terrible.
the boy is ill-starred acquaintance with such misfortunes.
why only days past he was set upon in our own streets, on way to appointment with Quintilius Varus.
the same man who, absent Vettius' presence, managed to find way to your ludus...
where this fucking cock eater stole the primus from me!
hold your tongue.
how do you answer this?
he accuses absent cause.
my wife and her friend Gaia came upon good Varus in town, baking under noon-day sun.
she knew Varus from her days in Rome, offered respite at my villa while he waited for the absent boy to come to purpose.
a fortunate coincidence for all involved.
and was it this same fortune that saw me set upon by your fucking men?
did you see faces? Did they bear my mark, you wet cunt...
enough!
remove yourself to the street.
go.
and leave reasonable men to discourse.
your son has much to learn in the ways of diplomacy.
a subject all young men struggle to master.
let us school them in its ways.
you are better matched against wooden men.
work the palus, Gaul.
resume!
are we to follow Barca's commands now?
he shares my thoughts.
the Gaul falters against spear.
perhaps advice from a champion would aid his cause...
days past you fought me with something approaching skill.
yet opposite Barca, you act as his lover.
face down with cheeks your spread.
the spear is unknown to me.
you are Gaul.
did you never face the Arverni?
my years before capture never held the privilege.
they wield spear with deadly purpose.
as does Barca, from the judging.
he but instructs.
each blow a lesson never to be repeated.
you should be quite the scholar.
by the time he has beaten you to death.
you fought well against my two swords.
rid a Hoplomachus of his spear, and he is left with only one weapon.
if you have done with your man's cock,
I would have proper contest.
the gods bless Barca with another tiny man to fuck.
your Gannicus appears in fine form.
as he will in the primus, elevating the house with glorious performance.
my heart yet races at the thought of his last.
we'll place such memories behind us.
a difficult feat, when so enjoyed by all.
some more than others.
come here.
apologies, Domina. Guests have arrived.
Guests...?
we were not expecting...
Oh, the fault is mine, for failing to announce.
good Cossutius is on stay from Rome to celebrate the Vinalia.
after I extolled the virtues of the house of Batiatus...
I demanded introduction immediately.
you honor us, but my husband tends to final preparations for tomorrow's games in town.
Oh. How disappointing.
yet we could remove ourselves to the balcony for proper viewing of his gladiators until his return.
I fear you mistake intent.
I was not regaling Cossutius with tales of your men.
but of your house's more intimate delights.
I fear that was a... special consideration.
was it?
perhaps Vettius will be more accommodating then.
concerning this and my primus.
it would be unfortunate to have come so far, and find hands empty.
would it not?
I would not have it so.
Excellent!
let us prepare Gannicus and
no.
what joy is there in exploring ground already discovered?
none at all.
what do you offer?
a gladiator of your choosing, paired with a slave as yet untouched...?
untouched?
a delicacy no longer present at the moment in my house.
then it is fortunate you find yourself in ours.
Solonius! A word.
I would share its equal.
I came to you as trusted friend, carrying news of Tullius' renewed offer towards Gannicus...
you carried but shit, spewed from an errant hole.
and what of other knowledge I lighted upon treacherous ears?
that of Varus' arrival, to be met by Vettius?
Vettius is a fool.
under the employ of Tullius!
he will think I had hand in the boy's assault...
he suspects nothing!
his thoughts have turned towards my father inside.
what seized fucking mind, dispatching message to him?!
your father is in Capua?
he sits with Tullius as you bleat, stroking fucking cock.
why do you remain in the streets?
Oh, why do you think!?
I did not mean for his return.
I sought only advice, towards worry for a man I hold as brother.
intentions well-received.
let us place transgressions aside, in favor of more pressing concern.
your patience and reason recalls joyous times, when business was conducted by those who shared respect for it.
I fear we are a dying breed.
I am certain you shall outlive us all, Master Batiatus.
I hardly placed you.
the years weigh heavy on a man, do they not?
your presence is fortuitous, striking need to seek you out.
share walk, and let us review recent events...
am I allowed voice now?
could the gods halt the sound?
whatever Tullius and the boy may think,
I gained the primus on merit of Gannicus' prowess.
even if true, it is of no matter now.
Gannicus will not appear in the games.
but Varus has made personal request!
a necessary sacrifice, towards leveling unequal ground.
you will make apology to Varus, relaying Gannicus found injury in training.
and that Vettius is amply capable of seeing the primus attended.
you give away the primus, and now ask that I tongue the fucking boy's ass?
I ask nothing.
this is how it will be.
in return a few of our men will be paired against each other after mid-day sun.
our men fight themselves?
the only plank salvaged from such wreckage.
then we must choose the men with care.
they have been chosen for us.
Tullius now selects my fucking men as well?
an unavoidable concession.
barca and Gnaeus,
Auctus to face your Gaul, Crixus.
Crixus? Is but a recruit, not yet a fucking gladiator!
who you failed to mention was purchased from Tullius.
to gain...
to gain his favor.
and what fruits did your scheme bear? Huh?
Oh, this is price due for attempting to maneuver men above your station.
be thankful it was not more costly.
are you certain you would not prefer the man bathed and scented?
he stands perfect towards his cause.
I would, however, gauge the freshness of your offerings.
remove your robes.
did I not tell you?
they are of a form.
but a woman's worth is not always revealed to the eyes.
a man must probe deeper for true value...
remove yourself to the vestibule.
return if Dominus and his father are seen upon the road.
I shall have this one.
she's considerably tighter.
move on top of him.
do you know why I chose this man?
so crudely etched?
the smell of shit hot upon his breath?
because this world is filled with the grotesque.
and the divine.
they exist together, two sides of a coin.
you cannot have one absent threat of the other.
yet words do not convey the true nature of this.
it must be experienced.
it must be felt...
and never forgotten.
Oh, your absence has been missed in Rome since your husband's passing.
your charms will brighten darkest night.
I long to return.
and crest dawn upon a husband yet of this world.
how does your dowry stand?
I was under impression you were absent family of means.
gaia is a treasure within herself.
one to be coveted.
by a man untethered to the burden of position and appearance.
you were well satisfied?
praise laid upon your house has not been exaggerated.
it is a wonder.
that such base diversion would be impossible to conceal in Rome.
Capua is city of many pleasures.
often obscured by pressing business, to which we sadly must attend.
you take leave? So soon?
a regrettable necessity.
gratitude for your hospitality.
I look forward to seeing you at the games.
and your man Gannicus upon my primus.
Oh, you honor us.
Crixus begins to show promise.
upon his back?
the man always rises. A trait to be admired.
so you have eyes for the Gaul now?
and if I did?
I would fucking kill you.
come here...
you fucking cunts!
you soil our food!
why should we not make meal of your fucking pets...
you do not help your friend?
this is a fight between brothers.
I do not yet bear the mark.
have you lost fucking mind?!
stand down!
calm yourselves!
is this what my house has fallen to?
brother setting upon brother, so far removed from the honor of the arena, where such contest holds meaning?
this points to reason the gods have turned from us, stripping the primus from our hands.
I do not fight in the games?
you do not.
yet our sacrifices do not stand unrewarded.
a few of you will take to the sands after mid-day sun.
and I expect those chosen to bring more honor to the House of Batiatus than you now bring to yourselves.
Yeah! Fuck you!
Gnaeus fights Barca!
and I will split your ass in two.
fuck.
you do not gain position?
I do. Against Crixus.
uh, your favorite.
the man does not even bear the fucking the mark.
I am to fight?
so you fight in the arena,
I do not.
the gods truly punish me.
I long to be of the brotherhood.
to become a gladiator.
but to be awarded position...
dit is an honor I have not earned.
there are many things given to us in this life, for the wrong reasons.
what we do with such blessings that is the true test of a man.
go well, return victorious brother.
fucking shits
may Auctus fall.
and Barca follow.
return victorious, brothers.
for I am out of wine.
after all we've done.
the sacrifices made.
only to have the primus torn from grasp.
torn would imply resistance.
my father offers none.
you could not move him from this decision?
Hercules would fail in the labor.
are we set to leave?
I would not arrive late.
Doctore gathers the men.
perhaps some mulsum while you wait, father.
to celebrate your return to the games.
you seek to ply me with honeyed-wine?
you find my weakness.
and I would have it exploited.
I shall join you.
it disquiets your stomach too much.
especially in hot weather such as this.
it never did agree with you.
a trait gained from your mother.
a presence sorely missed.
every day.
your Gaul appears ragged.
the result of extensive training. In preparation for the test he has yet to take.
you set this in motion, Quintus.
by purchasing the man to gain favor.
only after I looked into his eyes, and saw a spark.
as you always spoke of.
then today presents rare opportunity.
Auctus, a man forged beneath my rule, to face Crixus, forged beneath yours.
the outcome to prove if son has learned anything of worth from father.
your time has come.
gratitude.
for all you have taught me.
fight with honor.
and if the gods will it...
die the same.
a word.
you have shown great promise.
in practice. In exhibition against Gannicus.
yet this is the arena.
this is where men become gods.
legions with far greater training and skill than you have fallen upon this sacred ground.
many beneath Auctus' spear.
but I do not think that you will be one of them.
you have the blood of a champion.
to rival any my father has ever heralded.
do you wish to behold such miracle come to pass?
it is all I desire.
then seize fucking glory.
and see us both proven worthy.
have you set Crixus to purpose?
I stoke the flame as best I can.
a pity it is not Gannicus, nor the primus.
it was well earned.
yet he is the one honored.
while his only fucking son is left to languish.
soon your father will attest your worth.
or decay into the afterlife.
either way, we will be free of him.
an epic showing from the House of Batiatus, certain to please the gods!
in gratitude, we will be merciful, and grant life!
you are overly kind.
your house has been most accommodating, and should be rewarded.
well, gratitude. I...
are you unwell?
perhaps the excitement is too much for him.
it is but the heat and dust.
water.
I would not have torrid throat announce your final offering.
address the crowd?
the honor is unfit a lanista.
we decide what befits a lanista, Batiatus.
make introduction and let us move on.
I stand humbled before the great people of Capua.
in gratitude,
I present the final offering from the House of Batiatus.
entering the arena, a virgin upon its sands...
Murmillo!
his opponent, a warrior unmatched in skill and honor.
Hoplomachus!
begin!
Auctus wields spear to rival Mars himself.
well he has been well trained.
the same cannot be said of Crixus.
perhaps he should have remained a hauler of stone.
stupid fuck!
kill the little cunt!
fuck!
what?
fuck!
barca has taught you well...
Yes!
a fine showing, Batiatus!
with unexpected conclusion!
indeed it was.
I swear to be burned, chained, beaten, or die by the sword.
in pursuit of honor in the arena.
welcome to the brotherhood.
Crixus proves himself.
perhaps even as match for Gannicus one day.
in and out of the arena.
you fought well. Brother.
your Gaul, still yet a recruit, defeated a gladiator I considered among the best of my men.
it would appear I underestimated Crixus.
as I did my son.
you honor me, father. - Oh, you honor yourself.
when cleared of plots and schemes.
thoughts far removed, never to return.
nothing pleases more than to see reason take hold of senses.
and a house righting its path.
I will see it continued in your absence.
absence?
I assume you return to Sicilia. Your health...
seeing Crixus' victory stirred passions I have not felt in many years.
for the blood and the sand, the roar of the crowd.
Oh, it lifts spirits more than change of clime could hope to offer.
no, I will stay at your side, and together we shall see the House of Batiatus rise to former glories. Huh.
you remain here?
until breath flees wearied flesh, calling me to the afterlife.
join our FRS and have fun! QQ Group No. 37304379

... it's the only malt liquor...

and when you pop the top, the panties drop.
is that Anaconda Malt Liquor?
the only malt liquor to be approved by the United States government?
that's right. Anaconda Malt Liquor.
anaconda Malt Liquor, brewed in Piedmont, Georgia.
gentlemen, every one of you are the most respected men in your region.
doing business with me, you'll find you'll be protected...
... and you will be supplied with as much as you can distribute.
however, one of us here is not who he appears to be.
come on, you jive turkeys.
what kind of rundown is this?
look, man...
... I gotta get back to the streets where I come from, Sucker.
hold it.
I told you jive chumps, I ain't no snitch.
who said you were?
he's dead.
my God, men.
do you know what this means?
do you know whose brother...?
this ghetto is gonna be turned upside-down, I tell you, upside-down.
the streets are gonna run crimson with the blood of the men responsible for his brother's death.
man I am speaking of is a veritable one-man army.
and if you get on his bad side, brother, you're done for.
it's only a matter of time before he finds out...
... and when he does, no matter where he is...
... get ready, gentlemen. Because hell's a-coming.
coming, coming, coming.
black Dynamite, that was the best loving I ever had.
me too.
that goes triple for me.
mama, you're gonna wake up the rest of the bitches.
I wanna tell you a story about a friend I've had.
he's a mean motherfucker and he's super bad.
so grab on to your seats and hang on tight...
... while I tell you a story about Black Dynamite.
yeah?
dynamite, baby, Nipsy still ain't paid up.
solid. I'm on it, Bee.
who's there?
I'm looking for Nipsy.
there's no Nipsy here.
now, I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Where's Nipsy?
here I am, sucker.
honeybee, what's happening, baby?
black Dynamite. What did you do to Nipsy?
now, word on the street is that he's gonna be in traction.
you know me. Just talked to him.
thank you, Black Dynamite.
I'm so happy.
Hey, they mess with you, Mama, they're messing wth me.
black Dynamite, I wanna thank you for taking care of us girls while we was down and out and didn't have no pimp.
Oh, I almost forgot.
ain't nobody seen Pimpin' Jake for two days...
... and he ain't been by here with your money.
and... - I knew I forgot something.
tiny.
get Pimpin' Jake out of my trunk.
tell him the rest by Wednesday or I'll make him stick himself.
I'm sorry. Go on, Bee.
they replaced the chain on your nunchucks and oiled the bearings.
they're sitting there on your desk, next to the dry cleaning.
all right. What's wrong, Honeybee?
I've known you too long.
now, if something's bothering you, why don't you lay it on me?
black Dynamite. I got to go to the hospital.
it's my little nephew, Bucky. He OD'd.
where is Bucky and what has he had?
it's that new drug on the street.
all the kids are falling prey to it.
what we gonna do, Black Dynamite?
I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna fight.
the only way I know how.
ever since I was a boy, all I knew was how to fight.
fight, fight, fight.
and when I got tired, I would fight some more.
and now that the Man has got our backs to the wall...
... I ain't gonna let him hurt the kids.
I'm gonna take him down.
I'm gonna take them all down.
who the hell is interrupting my kung fu?
who the hell is this? - Black Dynamite, it's your Aunt Billy.
how many times I told you not to call here...
... and interrupt my kung fu?
it's bad news, Dynamite.
it's your only brother, Jimmy.
he's dead, Dynamite.
Jimmy's dead.
scram.
I said split.
shake the scene, you turkeys. Get out of my house.
I'll see you all tomorrow.
how did it happen, Aunt Billy?
they found him shot full of holes in an old shipping yard.
dead as a dog.
said he had drugs on him.
I guess he was still on that stuff.
now, I thought you promised your mama on her deathbed...
... you was gonna get him off that stuff, Black Dynamite.
whoever did this is gonna pay.
I can promise you that.
well, I hope it ain't like when you promised your mama...
... you was gonna get him off of that stuff for the rest of his natural life
black Dynamite, I want you to promise me...
... that you'll look after your brother...
... and make sure he doesn't end up on drugs...
... or dead.
I promise.
Jimmy, I am 18-year-old Black Dynamite...
... and you are my 16-year-old kid brother...
... and you are high as a kite yet again.
who gave you the drugs, Jimmy?
who?
your mama would turn over in her grave if she were here to see this.
she loved Jimmy with all her heart.
you promised your mama on her deathbed...
... that you would look after Jimmy.
now he's dead.
I scoured the crime scene like you told me to.
dig what I found.
now, this is some heavy shit.
freeze, turkeys.
I see you haven't lost your touch, B.D.
o'leary?
the old "pie on the windowsill" trick. I can't believe I fell for that.
that was the same trap you used in Nam to save my ass.
B. D. took our fatigues and put them on two dead gooks.
I remember we circled back and turned the tables.
I guess you forgot about the time you and Bravo company...
... left my black ass for dead, huh?
but I remember.
I remember everything.
I remember Vietnam like it was yesterday.
I rememberthat village in Tainan that we cut down.
it was a massacre.
all the dead Chinamen we left in our tracks.
I remember the faces, the children.
this one child I'll never forget.
poor little bastard was still alive.
his little Chinese legs were blown clean off.
still see his little shins and feet...
... hanging from the ceiling fan across the hut.
he was charred from his head down to his little Chinese knees.
he tried to get up...
... but he fell over when what was left of his right leg broke off.
as he laid there flat on his face...
... he looked up at me.
his little Chinese eyes burned right into my stomach...
... deep into my soul.
he said something to me in Chinese, like:
sounds like some cartoon shit...
... but I understood it to be a question that he was asking me.
and I don't have to know how to speak Chinese...
... to know what that question was.
why, Black Dynamite?
Why?
we're a long way from Nam.
look at this place.
it must have an eight-track player in every room.
what's going on today is a smack problem of epic proportion.
corruption is running rampant and we don't know who to trust.
we need you, Black Dynamite, now more than ever.
I know I was the best CIA agent that the CIA ever had...
... but I thought I told you honkies from the CIA...
... that Black Dynamite was out of the game.
you're never out of the game. - I've known you for a long time.
and there's something that you're not telling me.
okay.
we heard about your brother's death. The last thing we need...
... is you running through the streets creating a river of blood.
tell me who did it and I'll just leave a puddle.
we don't know who killed Jimmy.
you step out of line, friendship or not, and I'm gonna take you down.
in case you forgot, when you left the agency...
... you relinquished your license to kill.
well, you do what you have to.
just don't get in my way.
come on, give it up to Afroditey and the Moonchild.
give them a nice round of applause, big round of applause, yeah.
black Dynamite, you came to see me.
bitch, no, I gotta go rap a taste with my man Horn...
... but afterwards since I'm here, maybe I'll throw you one right quick.
out of sight.
I get off in 15 minutes.
you're right about that, sugar.
you're right about that.
bullhorn, can I get you anything?
Yes. I would like some of that ass.
Yes, yes, yes.
man, who dare knock when I'm planning to plant my--?
main man Black Dynamite.
what it is, Bullhorn?
what you want to eat, man?
sister Betty made some hog maws and, man, she put her ankle in it.
I ain't here for no food, Horn.
Oh, man.
I can dig it.
sugar, give us a minute.
you know, man...
... I'm really sorry to hear about what happened to Jimmy.
you know, me and you been tight for a long time.
so you know if you need anything... - Thanks, Horn.
I need to know about the kind of cats that Jimmy was running with.
you know, he came around here about a week ago...
... with some cats that I had never seen before.
man, I mean, these cats looked mean.
meaner than two fat motherfuckers wrestling over pork chops and greens.
can you dig it?
Yeah. I can dig it.
that little old half-a-player, Cream Corn, was with them.
you remember Cream Corn.
so where is Cream Corn these days?
Yep, that's right.
I'm running things.
cream Corn. That's why they call me that.
smooth.
I got my measure for your pleasure.
stick with me, baby, I'll have you farting through silk.
and let a nigga mess with me.
I'll jump on him, all 93 pounds of pure dynamite
let me catch my breath, Black Dynamite.
shut up, sucker. I need answers.
I wanna know who the cats were that Jimmy was hanging with.
man, I don't know nothing but nothing.
okay, all right, all right.
their leader's name is Chicago Wind.
they hang out at a place called the Hip Pocket on Crenshaw.
now, get me up.
so you must be Black Dynamite.
cream Corn, you jive mother.
Chicago Wind, I presume.
your presumption is correct, nigga.
if you presume that I killed your brother then you presume wrong.
not that it means shit to me.
either way, shit.
I wish I'd have killed that nigga myself.
somebody else beat me to it.
is that so?
well, Mr. Chicago Wind...
... what do you know about this?
some heavy shit.
but dig.
let me explain something to you, supernigga.
I don't answer questions.
I ask them.
even if I did know who killed that brother of yours...
... what would make you think I'm gonna tell you?
get your black ass out of my joint...
... before we beat you like a rented mule.
that's right, you jive-ass punk.
don't be coming to the Hip Pocket talking that shit, you dig?
that's right, nigga. Don't ever, ever come ba
go catch Chicago Wind before he disappears.
I'll take care of this gorilla-eating goon here.
Oh, you's a corn-fed fool with a lot of muscle mass.
but it's time for Bullhorn to get up in that ass.
motherfucker.
let everybody know and suckers be warned...
... that this is the outcome when you mess with Bullhorn.
try to catch me now, sucker.
motherfucker.
now you know why they call me Chicago Wind, fool.
because I left your ass blowing in the breeze.
man, don't you ever, ever...
that black son of a bitch, he killed my best dealer.
I want Black Dynamite dead, and want him dead now.
before you support any of these candidates...
... find out if they're going to rid our communities of the hustlers and pushers.
or are they gonna destroy all the programs that help our children...
... and give their corporate friends free reign to exploit our community...
... like Congressman James.
watch me turn this shit around.
power to the people.
with all due respect to the young sister here...
... you all know me.
Yes.
now, young lady...
...these fine folks don't need to be misled.
all they want is a little bit of bread.
and you can't just stick it to the Man.
you also got to have yourself a plan.
now, we got to take this from the jukebox to the ballot box.
we got to go from the poor house to the White House.
instead of maligning me...
... let's take this land from sea to shining sea.
keep the faith, brothers and sisters.
say, Mama, you're gonna have to work on your delivery if you wanna take on Congressman James.
the shame is, half these people don't know what y'all talking about...
... but at least they can put his to a beat.
so, what do you do to make a difference?
do you march? Do you vote?
Oh, let me guess.
you're one of Tom Slick brothers...
... think you can get by on good looks, a wink and a smile, huh?
I don't know about Tom Slick.
but thank you for the compliments.
that's not what meant.
not that I think that you have good look
I mean, you know these guys with their
winks and smiles. - Yeah.
what about the smile?
I am smiling.
right on, right on.
excuse me, brothers.
the militants turn, startled.
this is private.
how'd you get in here?
I walked in.
so you one of them sneaky brothers, huh?
or maybe you an undercover pig.
or maybe you just a federal hit man.
if I was, you cats would already be dead.
now, let me speak to the man in charge.
sarcastically, I'm in charge.
right on.
if you were in charge...
... the people might as well surrender to whitey right now...
... because your survival skills ain't worth a damn.
black Dynamite.
it has been a long time, my brother.
what it is, Saheed?
you know this Uncle Tom?
listen, sucker.
I'm blacker than the ace of spades and more militant...
... than you and your whole damn army put together.
and while you're out there...
... chanting at rallies and browbeating politicians...
... l'm taking out any money front sucker on a humble...
... that gets in my way.
so I'll tell you what.
when your so-called revolution starts, you call me...
... and I'll be right down front showing you how it's done...
... but until then, you need to shut the fuck up when grown folks is talking.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, we heard about what went down at the Hip Pocket.
that was righteous.
that was personal, brother.
personal or not, you saved a lot of brothers and sisters.
you need our help, we're here.
I can dig it.
what can you tell me about this?
Yeah.
I ain't seen one of these in a while.
I was gonna fuck him up.
there it is.
I wish we could get some shit like this.
that round will go through a bulletproof vest like it was a pillow.
any idea who would have it?
whoever it is, he must work for the Man...
... because that right there is strictly government issue.
you mind telling me how this was found...
... at the scene of my brother's death?
okay, Black Dynamite.
want me to level with you?
your brother Jimmy wasn't a two-bit drug dealer.
he was one of us. - What?
he was working undercover.
and he wanted to be just like you.
Jimmy, why didn't you tell me?
Vincent Rafelli.
don of the Carbozi family.
heads up a shipping company.
we believe he's distributing dope.
Jimmy felt that the don and Congressman James...
... had something up their sleeve.
he didn't quite know what it was.
he died trying to find out.
so I don't need to tell you the importance of this mission.
but I just have one question.
are you in or are you out?
because God knows you're the only one we can trust.
I'm in.
good.
I had a feeling you were gonna say that.
hope you don't mind.
I took the liberty of reinstating your license to kill.
you're gonna need this.
black Dynamite's looking for us.
you said you would handle it.
I'm bringing in the heavy hitters now.
somebody broke into my dead brother Jimmy's apartment.
breathe deeply, baby.
daddy, you make my heart beat.
Yeah, Dr. Dynamite can hear that.
but I think you're running a temperature.
let me see if I can find a thermometer for you.
what the--?
I told you urine sample, Nurse Jenny.
black Dynamite.
I mean, really.
you sent her in here with them titties.
what did you expect?
how's my x-ray?
well, no fragments.
in and out.
you're lucky, Black Dynamite.
three nches to the left...
... and we wouldn't even be having this conversation.
three inches to the right, it would've missed my black ass.
well, you need a new line of work.
this is the second time this year.
I know, I know.
why do I bother? There's no helping you.
no, doc, you help me just fine.
see you next time.
you hang in there, Leon. You hear me?
Hey, Mama, what's going down? That your kid in there?
no.
nephew? Cousin?
I said no.
no relation, he...
he happens to be one of the kids at the orphanage where I work.
he overdosed on smack. Third one this month.
and why? What does it matter to you anyway?
whoa, Mama, just trying to help.
Oh, I don't need your kind of help.
men like you only help when there's something in it for them.
they can't be bothered.
too busy chasing their chicks and their bread and their fancy car.
no, Mr. Black Dynamite.
the only help you know is how to help yourself.
whoa, Mama, it ain't about me.
it's about that kid in there.
now do you really want help...
... or are you just trying to prove to the world you can do it all on your own?
mama always said:
a helping hand is a helping hand, clean or dirty.
guess my hands ain't clean enough for you.
wait.
these politicians don't give a damn.
I mean, look, look at these ads.
congressman James made promises to the people.
then he took away his drug-awareness programs...
... and allowed his bedfellows to sell crap to the kids.
he even invested in these products.
now the dope is everywhere. It's even
it's even in the orphanage.
not the orphanage.
I used to be an orphan.
you ain't got no mommy and you ain't got no daddy.
you're an orphan.
orphan, orphan, orphan.
no, not the orphans.
I think I need to show you something.
we've been trying to reach these children.
but this new smack on the street is proving too much of a match for us.
the worst thing about these pushers...
... getting these children addicted to this new smack...
... is that these children are orphans, and orphans don't have parents.
ain't nothing in the world get Black Dynamite more mad...
... than some jive-ass sucker dealing smack to the kids.
Bobby, stop it.
you'll kick soon.
you dealing, brother?
I need my smack, I need it now.
put a few of these honeys on the street and I'll get you your bread, partner.
I refuse to let this happen to you, little man.
I will shake this poisonous shit out of your smacked-up body...
... if I have to.
black Dynamite, stop. We've tried that, nothing works.
I can't look at these kids no more.
this orphanage used to be alive with laughter, kids playing.
now look at it, it's sickening.
whoever's responsible is gonna pay, if it's the last thing I do.
black Dynamite, I wish it was that simple.
but this is much bigger than you and me.
Hey, Little Mama.
it may be bigger than you and it may be bigger than me.
but it ain't bigger than you and me. Can you dig it?
I think so.
I gotta split.
you need me to drop you off somewhere?
no, I think I'm gonna go down the street and grab a bite.
I'll drive you.
thanks for the ride.
can I get some hot sauce for my donut?
excuse me, lady.
Oh, my God. - What is it? What is going on?
how did you know?
donuts don't wear alligator shoes.
damn.
sorry, Roscoe.
it's cool, man.
chili and donuts ain't working out for me no how.
maybe it's time for a change.
what have you gotten me into?
it wasn't me they were after, sugar.
you must have pissed off some people in some pretty high places.
I'm gonna take you somewhere you'll be safe.
black Dynamite, you ain't got to worry about Gloria.
she gonna be safe up in here.
I been keeping the girls up on their kung fu like you told me to.
now, they find her up in here, we will fricassee they honky asses.
you sure about this? Maybe we should call the police.
no, Mama. You can bet your sweet ass and half a titty...
... whoever put that hit on you, already got the cops in their back pocket.
you be cool, Mama.
bee here will keep you tight and out of sight.
I'm gonna shake the tree from the roots and rake up the fruits...
... rip it up out the ground, find out what's going down.
don't worry about tomorrow, Mama, because tonight
dynamite's gonna make everything all right.
euphoria. Shut up. I know that was you.
I ain't even gotta look.
I should send you to Crenshaw Pete with his hot-ass coat hangers.
would you like that?
black Dynamite, I know that we just met...
... but somehow I feel that I can trust you.
I'll be here waiting till you come to get me.
thank you for saving my life.
you be cool, Little Mama.
I'll be back before too long.
order, order, order.
order, nigga.
the game is at an all-time low.
never in the history of the game has there been such devastation.
that's right. - Yeah.
tricks running low, cops pushing harder than ever.
Yeah. - That's right.
these little bitches just running wild.
I thought we had these poop-butt pigs paid off.
come to find out. - Yeah.
they trapping my ho's every time they hit the track.
I'm spending more bail money than I'm getting tail money.
Yeah. Yeah. I can dig it, Chocolate, I can dig it.
come on, this has been my worst physical year ever.
fiscal, nigga. With a F. Fiscal.
well, it's been the worst one ever. I can't even afford to get my hair fixed.
sounds like you're assed out.
you know what they say.
the bitch won't sell her ass.
a pimp will. - Will.
shut up, Tasty.
I turned you onto the game...
... when you nothing but a little jailhouse tramp.
now, listen up.
pimping has been around since the world started turning.
and it's going to keep right on turning right along with it...
... until this little planet rotates off its axis...
... as a result of its core overheating and explodes into cosmic dust.
damn.
can you dig it? - It's done, brother.
you know what I'm saying?
now look here. These times, they come and they go.
right. - And if you live long enough...
... you'll be around to see them come again.
but what we need to do is we need to collectivize.
Yeah. - Right on, right on.
now, look here.
listen.
stop all the bullshit and take a vote.
Yes, O.
all in favor, raise your hand.
Kotex?
mo Bitches? - I can dig it, baby.
chocolate Giddy-Up?
chocolate Giddy-Up.
crenshaw Pete?
captain Kangaroo Pimp?
Willie? - I'm with you.
nigga, even if they don't knock the broads...
... there ain't enough tricks to go around.
now, look here.
I don't know about the rest of y'all.
but it looks ike I have to keep selling heroin...
...just to make ends meet.
then you'll have a much bigger problem.
black Dynamite.
what's happening, baby?
what it is, Big O?
to what do we owe this pleasure?
I just got one thing to lay on you cats and then I'll split.
that I'm declaring war on anybody who sells drugs in our community.
but, Black Dynamite, I sell drugs to the community.
well, be that as it may, if I catch you...
... I will not consider you a brother or friend.
now, can you dig it?
hell no, nigga.
I can't dig it.
now who you supposed to be? - That's Black Dynamite.
I ain't ask you, nigga. Shut up.
I'm gonna tell you like this.
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do.
Yeah. - Well, the choice is yours, brother.
but if me and my people catch you...
... you're gonna have a lot more to deal with.
good evening, gentlemen. - Goodbye, Black Dynamite.
will you stop that...?
hold it right there.
it's me, Black Dynamite.
what the hell do you want? - I wanna help you.
why should I trust you after you dropped dime on me to Chicago Wind?
because your brother Jimmy saved my life.
I was supposed to be with him the night he got killed.
but he called me and told me to stay at home.
I guess I owe him one.
I'll need a list of names and locations.
ain't no thing.
man, everything is gonna be okay.
Bullhorn...
... Cream Corn here says he can help us find the cats we're looking for.
now, what do you think?
man, I think we should put our ankles in it.
they broke into my home.
they got the ledger.
they got the manifest, they got everything.
everything. Names, dates, schedules.
we even got the shipping routes.
they won't be able to take a shit without us knowing when or what color.
we cleaned up the streets and gave them back to the people.
once again, making them a pleasant place to take an afternoon stroll.
extra, extra. Hot off the presses.
black Dynamite cleans up the street.
it's unbelievable, Black Dynamite.
everyone looks so happy...
... and it's all thanks to you.
I'd like to take the credit but dig, Mama.
there's no I in "revolut--" In "team.
look, I'm know I'm gonna be rusty, but I have to try.
Hi, girls. What is your name?
I'm Shawanda, and her name's Brikwilla.
those are beautiful names.
I'm Gloria and this is Black Dynamite.
my mama said my daddy's name is Black Dynamite.
so did my mama.
hush up, little girls.
a lot of cats have that name.
well, that was amazing.
thank you for a beautiful day and night.
but I think I should be going.
I think you'll be safer if you stay here tonight.
Oh, you do, do you?
I hope you don't think you're gonna get any of this cookie.
because if I offered you some of this cookie...
... this cookie might kill you.
don't think because we've been frolicking in the park...
... you got this closed because it takes
Yeah, yeah, Mama.
you can hit the sheets or the streets. It don't make me no never mind.
that's your bag, baby. You can go or you can come.
can you dig it?
Yeah.
black Dynamite.
we read the ledger and it just don't stop.
there's a trail of paper that leads all the way to the top.
a big shipment is coming to town...
... and it's right there where that cracker wrote it down.
now, we don't know the whens, but we do know the wheres.
and however the fuck the whats, we'll sure enough be there.
looks like he's got two warehouses.
one big one, and one smaller one here.
we break into the two units, we hit the smaller one first...
... then we scale the fence, enter from the south...
... use an acetylene blowtorch to breech the warehouse from the back.
that way we avoid the guards.
man, them honkies gonna be running for cover when us brothers get
get-- Get
the torch is an issue.
we won't be able to get an acetylene torch in time.
think again, brother.
you know somebody that's got one?
I know just the cat.
all right, snowflake. Where's the dope?
up yours, coon.
it's right over there in the body bags, jeez.
so how much dope is in the big warehouse?
they're gonna kill me anyway. I'm not gonna tell you nothing, coon.
dynamite, I got something that will make him talk.
I ain't gonna tell you nothing.
operation Code Kansas. Can't stop it, too late.
operation Code Kansas gonna fix all the niggas.
Yeah, you won't be so big and so bad anymore...
... because Kansas gonna fix you.
just the niggas.
just the nig
damn, Smoke.
I think you gave him too much of that shit.
how long till it wears off?
it's malt liquor?
it's that new Anaconda Malt Liquor from the billboards.
it's supposed to give you:
tastes good too.
I know the drugs are here somewhere.
we're gonna check every crate until we find it.
I can't believe it, fellas.
that entire shipment was just malt liquor.
don't beat yourself up, Dynamite.
we still kept the 50 keys we found in that first warehouse...
... from getting on the streets.
I'm gonna go home and drink the rest of this, man.
y'all should've grabbed some of this shit. This shit is incredible.
I tell you, brothers, it just don't make no damn sense.
the manifest, the shipping log, the ledgers.
all records are consistent with that damned beer shipment.
if anything else was in there, it would have to weigh something.
they got it out before we got there.
no.
why would they have guards there if they got the drugs out?
no, them crackers was protecting something.
B. D. we checked every single crate, every stinking bottle.
man, I'm with you, Dynamite.
that babbling cracker knew something.
what that guard said, I keep running through my head.
code Kansas.
you people won't be so big anymore.
code Kansas.
it just don't make no damn sense.
Hey, sweet thing.
what don't make no sense is the service around this motherfucker.

you diabolical dick-shrinking motherfuckers.
you were the leak all the time.
and bet you were behind Jimmy's death.
Hey, man, I was just following orders.
that's what a good soldier does, follow orders, unlike you.
everything's gotta be done the Black Dynamite way.
I gave the order on Jimmy.
I gave it to James, who gave it to the don.

Hey, Black Dynamite, there's the island.

Yeah, right on, yeah.
buy a home in the country. Raise our own fruits and vegetables.
bake our own bread, know what I mean?
bake our own
who saw that coming--? Who saw where that came from?
let's go.
I should've known you would be behind this, Fiendish Dr. Wu.
your knowledge of scientific biological transmogrifications...
... is only out-matched by your zest for kung-fu treachery.
your kung fu is quite extraordinary, Black Dynamite.
but no match for mine.
you should have joined us when you had the chance.
but now you must die.
man, I'll take this jive-ass turkey.
bullhorn, no.
bullhorn, no.
at long last, our friendship bonded by the struggle against the Man...
... has been brought to an end by kung-fu treachery.
brother, your death will not go unavenged.
fiendish Dr. Wu, you done fucked up now.
get him.
you must try the Wu family Red Silk Kung Fu.
black Dynamite Panther Fist.
what the fuck, huh?
keep your eye on Black Dynamite.
looking for me?
can you see where I'm coming from, you jive motherfucker?
no rush, huh? Come on, huh?
you told him to keep an eye out for me.
I threw that shit before I walked in the room.
I wanna know who's pulling your strings.
now start talking. Talk.
I said, start talking. - Okay.
your government has been preoccupied...
... with building the bigger penis for years.
what's this green one?
it did exactly opposite of what it was intended.
it made the penis shrivel to the size of a 2-month-old snapping turtle.
this is what you've been putting in the malt liquor?
I was under orders.
they threatened to fire me.
speaking of fire.
suddenly, I'd like to leave your island.
No! No!
no.
you dirty motherfucker.
Hey, Black Dynamite, I found a helicopter.
quick, give me a hairpin.
what's in the briefcase, Black Dynamite?
how far does this all go, man?
cream Corn, this goes all the way to the top.
and when I say top, I mean the tippety-top.
there it is, Black Dynamite. The Honky House.
I'm going down.
this shouldn't take long. - Whoa, hey
take the controls. - What are you talking about?
whoa, hey, hey, man.
son of a bitch.
cream Corn, no!
I should have known it was you all the time.
I should have asked myself, "Who's the man so wicked...
...so cruel to serve smack to the orphanage...
...kill my brother Jimmy, and put out a drug to shrink black men's dicks?
only one man, and that's you, Tricky Dick.
so I'm here to deliver you one presidential ass-whooping.
black Dynamite.
there is a perfectly reasonable explanation for that.
showtime, motherfucker.
fucking...
black Dynamite.
who the fuck would duck...?
piece of shit.
don't fuck with me.
motherfucker.
take your filthy black hands off the presidential dinnerware...
... you moon cricket.
and now, Black Dynamite, you must die.
you had enough, Mr. President?
you'll never get away with this.
watch me, you little insecure cracker.
you think by shrinking our johnsons...
... it's gonna make your situation any better?
that's your problem, Tricky Dick. You are paranoid.
like sending those two-bit crooks to Watergate.
for what?
for these?
look at you. - What?
you lost it all, turkey.
kill me. - Say what?
kill me. - No.
that's the easy way out for you.
unless you want the rest of this freaky shit to hit the news...
... I suggest you take care of me and my people.
can you dig it?
I said, can you dig it?
Yes, I can dig it.
thought you could.
first Lady, I'm sorry I pimp-slapped you into that china cabinet.
I used excessive force.
oftentimes, I cross the line...
... but I try to do so in the name of what's right.
most of the time, the ends justifies the means.
but in this case, I feel like I betrayed my own code of ethics...
... and for that, sugar, I apologize.
but I shot at you.
I tried to kill you, Black Dynamite.
this is true, but you did not connect.
you shot a plate.
had you connected. Maybe pimp-slapping you into that might have been justified.
but I feel I crossed the line.
and for that, please accept my apology.
I do.
I do, it's just
Oh, Black Dynamite, you're so righteous.
this is also true.
because whenever there's injustice...
... wrongs to be
Oh, Black Dynamite.
go on, honey.
because wherever there's injustice, wrongs to be righted...
... innocents to be defended, Black Dynamite will be there...
... delivering ass-whoopings.
and I will not hesitate to lay the hammer down on any clown that comes around.
because if they wanna fight, they best come see me...
... because I'm Black Dynamite.
how you doing with that midget girl you sent out?
man, she keeps coming up short.
and better no nigga mess with me, neither.
I would jump on him, all 93 pounds of dynamite.
that's right.
so I says, "Bitch, you look like you need a pimp in your life.
she said, "I got a pimp.
I said, "Shit, that nigga ain't no pimp.
he a valet for ho's.
it's called the Mo Bitches Variety Pack.
Oh, yeah? - Yeah.
I send out a big ho, a little ho, a skinny ho, and one Navajo.
is that right? - That's right.
take that, you cracker-ass cracker.
all right, girls, let's take them down.
I only do two things well in this world.
I take money from bitches and I sell drugs to the community.
I had to send your ho back the other day.
no? - Yeah, man.
she reckless eyeballing and carrying on.
she fine, but I said, "Hey, your man is bona fide.
see? You're a righteous pimp.
shit, the rea pimping lives here.
it ain't ego.
that's how we go. You like that?
you gotta cross the lines sometimes.
sometimes to do the right thing, you got to do the ugly thing.

we are supposed to go on our honeymoon. - Yeah, we don't think Sydney would tolerate the flight.
I promise you we'll go to ltaly - eventually.
that's big. If that's a promise, I'll take that.
where are you vacationing this year? - We're going to one of those water theme park.
that'll be nice.
it's a joke, Celia.
I promised my wife that we'd dance tonight, Tony, so if you'll excuse us...
certainly. - It was wonderful to see you both.
good night.
it's a little crowded out here right now. Let's wait for the next song.
so really... how was I?
you were perfect. Absolutely perfect. With the backlighting you could see right through your dress.
no, you were wonderful, really wonderful. I'm so proud of you.
don't be too proud. Poor Sydney's still stuck in that small space.
tell you what. If you promise you'll take time off for a trip to ltaly with me
I promise to build Sydney a new home, with or without the rest of the funding.
deal.
come on. You can stand on my feet.
return to me
Oh my dear, I'm so lonely
hurry home, hurry home
won't you please hurry home to my heart
my darling
if I hurt you I'm sorry
forgive me
and please say you're mine
return to me
we got a female, 34, car accident. Hit on the right side.
head trauma, unconscious at the scene, never regained.
name? - Any allergies?
sir? Her name.
sir? - Eli-Elizabeth Rueland.
sorry, sir. You can't go in.
you're going to have to wait here.
we're going to try to help her.
Andiamo. Get that while it's hot. - I got it, Marty.
Aah, sure I'll get it myself. - Suit yourself, baby.
Where's Sophie?
Sophie's got a perm today. Her scalp is still burning. She went home early.
Oh, of course she did. Why did I ask?
will you go find yourself a gondola?
pick up.
now then, Nancy darlin'...
it looks massive but you'll get through it.
thank you.
Marty, how is Gracie doing?
Oh, fine, you know. We... we're all waiting.
are you still keeping up the rosary? - Every night.
give her our love. - Oh, I will, of course. Of course I will.
I can do that. Where are the three chicken Vesuvios?
already served them, Marty. - Thank you very much. Grazie.
Oh, you've got it, haven't you?
you have? Thanks be to God and all the saints in heaven!
let me talk to her.
I'll be right over. Here's Angelo now.
you got a heart, huh?
what, like an hour into it?
someone will come out and tell you intermittently. Excuse me.
he's here.
you're here. - Isn't she beautiful?
grandpa, thank you for always taking care of me.
and if I don't come out...
I love you so much.
you've got to come out. If those tulips you planted come up and see only me standin' there, they'll go back into the ground again.
Thanks. Give me a kiss.
OK, folks.
here we go. - Pray, Grandpa.
we'll take good care of her.
I'll see you later. - Yes.
I got to walk Mel.
I left the hospital a few hours ago. I came by and took him to the park.
OK.
Thanks.
I'm gonna stay. - No.
I'll pick your parents up from the airport in the morning.
Thanks.
OK.
if you need anything, you call me. I'll be here in two minutes.
thank you, Charlie.
she's not coming home, Mel.
blessed Michael the Archangel, who protects in battle, and this is the greatest battle of our lives...
I know my wife never thought much of you but you were always my favourite saint.
cos you're a battler, you're a fighter. Well, fight for us now, Michael. Fight for us.
in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. Amen.
Adam Martin Dayton, what is that?
cherry pop.
Sophie, did you give him wine? - Angelo...
angelo, what are you doin' to me here?
it's... tranquillizer. - Oh, that's great!
so sue me. Now they're drunk and disorderly.
is that funny, Dad?
stop it right now, both of you. Joe!
Joe... - What?
help me out. Take the kids to your mom's. It's one in the morning.
here, Emmett. Nourish yourself. - Thank you.
could I have milk?
Tyler, I want all your brothers up here.
I'll only buy more.
let's go. - I wanna stay and see the new heart.
you'll see it when it comes home. Come on.
no stopping anywhere. You come straight back here.
I'll stop at a lap-dancing bar. - That's so funny!
Where's Marty? - Dad, where's Marty?
in the chapel.
hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee...
want me to shuffle for you?
want to ante a quarter? - Yes. I do.
this guy you're talkin' about, he can't sing at all.
how come he's got such a big band? - To drown him out.
Wally, stay out of this.
how many famous Polish singers are there?
I got two words for you: Bobby Vinton.
Bobby Vinton?! Bobby Vinton, Bobby Vinton!
well, what have you got? The lrish Rovers?
I got three words for you.
mr Bing Crosby.
he made a lovely priest.
but he beat the hell out of his kids.
doesn't mean he couldn't sing. Sinatra beat up everybody.
Frank did not. His people did, he did not.
look at Dean Martin.
the guy never hit anybody.
what about Jerry? But he was askin' for it.
the point is: we got Frank, we got Dean, we got Perry Como,
vic Damone, Bobby Darin,
mario Lanza, Luciano Pavarotti, we got Beniamino Gigli, we got the composers!
verdi, Leoncavallo!
millions. - That's right. A dynasty.
I'm not bragging, but... - You're not?
you're not bragging?
Christ, he goes on for a half hour.
Oh, come on.
I'll take you to the doctor in my Caddy. - No thanks, I'll take my bike.
let him take you. Suppose it rains? - Then I'll get wet.
then you'll be sick.
Gracie, settle this: best male singer, dead?
Dean Martin.
Frank! - Bing.
Bobby Vinton!
now, go straight to your appointment, then you go to meet Megan.
if your plans change, telephone me.
I may stop off at the Pussycat Club. One of their strippers quit.
don't say strippers. God's listening to you.
it's been over a year. You can hardly see it.
nice try, Angelo. I just don't like all the questions.
tell everybody you're the luckiest girl in the world.
I know, Grandpa.
you're beautiful - and no one's going to notice your chest.
thanks a lot!
I'll see you later. - Bye, Grace!
ride on the sidewalk, now.
leave her alone.
stop in at the church as you go by.
she's thanked God enough already.
you're going to be a long while in purgatory.
Really? Well, I'll be with friends.
God's listening to that.
all right, guys...
now, out of respect we gotta give honourable mention to Sammy Davis Jr.
he only had one eye, so... what else can I tell ya?
he was Irish, you know. - Are you blind? He was Jewish.
whatever. Somethin' didn't fit.
this is hard for him.
everyone he's ever loved has died. I'm all he has, he's all I have.
morning, Grace. - Hey, Alice.
everything's looking very good. How are you feeling?
good. Happy. Of course I'm happy. - Good.
what else am I gonna be? - Well, we all have our days.
add those to your morning meds.
I don't feel like I should have "days."
I should be happy just to be alive - and I am.
I'm alive cos someone else is dead.
I should just shut up and be happy, right?
Mm-hm.
you can get dressed. See you next month. Say hi to your grandfather.
he's a great listener!
what, honey? - Nothing.
Tom, what the hell is goin' on?
it's not my department. - Whose is it?
my guys worked 18 hours. - At time and a half. I'm cryin' for ya!
you got the best guys here. - I don't give a shit.
I got to take a break.
you're on Wabash at 3 o'clock - new beams goin' in.
keep up.
mail it, Grace. You'll feel better. - I know. I want to.
every time I go to do it, I... I can't.
I don't know why not. It's anonymous.
it says you're grateful. I'd want to get it if I lost someone I loved. Wouldn't you?
Yeah, but... it just seems so strange.
sending a thank-you note for a heart.
it seems so...
.not enough.
won't you feel worse not sending it? - Yeah. I mean, I always have it.
and it's been a year, so drop it in and move on. I'm sure they have.
Yeah.
let it go.
everybody clap for Auntie Grace. She just mailed a very important letter.
mom, look at the cool truck! - Yeah. Oh, look at that.
look at their arms. - Yeah. Wow!
OK, come on - gorillas.
Karson, your pants are falling down.
these are Adam's. He has your pants on.
that's all right. Come on, Laura.
Laura, stay in front of Mommy all the time while we're here.
aunt Grace, are you OK?
Yeah. Whatever it was, it didn't hurt.
let's try it. See if we can get him to come over.
here... - Here he comes!
look, Mom, he likes us.
doesn't he remind you of Daddy? - He looks bigger than Daddy.
do you see? - That's kinda sweet.
Bob, don't go in there. I just talked to 'em!
OK, guys, here's the deal.
my wife wanted this building up years ago, so we're way behind schedule.
first of all, you: artificial trees are not planted.
I'm asking for an additional 50 feet to build around the existing oaks.
and I will leave plenty of room for your godforsaken souvenir shop.
if you don't approve, I'm walking, I'm taking my men and it's over. Because I don't need the work and I'm certainly not here because of the money. I'm here because of my wife.
have you got it?
good.
thanks for yellin' and screamin'. Now I gotta go in and clean everything up.
you want to get a drink? Somethin' to shake this off?
come on! Let's go get a beer. - Thanks, Charlie. No.
well, if not tonight, Friday night. Because I got somebody for you.
Charlie, no.
she's got a great body: attorney, great body, intelligent...
you gotta start goin' out! She loves animals - her cat was a patient of mine.
I'm a dog person.
I'm just trying to help you.
Dan, you got 'em! - It's the first time I'm wearing 'em.
you look good. - Feelin' good.
need some help? - I think I'll be OK.
look at you!
where are you goin'? - I don't know.
Thanks. I took Mel out.
put the mail next to the phone. On the pile.
Thanks, buddy. See you later.
come on, Mel.
any calls?
you have no messages.
wanna eat?
Hi. - Hi, Mr Rueland.
Hey, Mel!
there you go. - Thanks. See you tomorrow night.
Yeah. - Bye. Bye, Mel!
come on. In the kitchen.
I got you some rice.
here we go.
you're gonna eat in here today.
good.
come on. Come on.
I'm not doin' this any more. We're goin' back to eatin' in the kitchen.
goddammit, Mel, come on back here and eat in the kitchen like a normal person!
good boy, good boy. Come on, let's go.
to the kitchen. Let's go. That's it. Follow me.
there's a good boy.
good boy. You made it halfway.
you gotta snap out of it, buddy.
Charlie, it's Bob.
I'm gonna go out with you on Friday, all right?
Yeah, you heard me.
where?
O'Reilly's?
O'Reilly's ltalian restaurant?
OK.
where is that?
big finish, Grandpa!
I'm still trying to get them to play "Danny Boy."
all right, I got a chicken Vesuvio and a corned beef and cabbage - no butter.
all right, darlin'.
now... don't eat that.
Oh, my God!
save it for the ltalians. I know you love me.
can we afford it?
Angelo says a true artist must paint in the Pissa Navona.
piazza Navona!
you know, I... I could go over with you. - Sure, yeah.
Marty, let her go alone. - Or... you wouldn't have to go at all...
she'll be fine. - I'm gonna go.
she's never before been on an aeroplane and Rome is far away.
she'll be fine. You paid for the ticket. - We'll discuss it later on.
Ange. Two more, hon. - Sophie, he gave her the ticket!
you couldn't wait till I was here?
she had the same look on her face then as she has now. Show her.
I miss everything!
well, the customers out there are missing you, so...
can I at least look at it?
here, look.
don't touch it!
look how much it cost. - It's so beautiful!
you deserve it, sweetie. - She does indeed.
Oh, well. All right, let's go. - Thank you.
all right, back to work.
thank you, Grandpa.
angelo, thank you!
how did you talk him into it?
my goodness! I'm so proud of him.
he loves you so much, he's like an ltalian mamma!
I can't wait to tell Megan. She's gonna flip out.
I got another surprise for you.
he is here. - Who's he?
the guy I was telling you about. He's at the bar, waitin' to meet you.
Oh, Angelo... - Don't worry. I told him everything.
I told him you had your chest worked on. - What?!
angelo, he's gonna think I had a... - What?
whatever.
it doesn't matter. He's a terrific guy. In fact, he had a transplant too.
Coraggio - go on.
my doctors - they say it's a solid transplant.
look how natural it looks. Go ahead, give it a tug.
no, that's OK. - Oh, come on, give her a tug!
good evening, sir.
are you staying or leaving or what? - I'm staying.
thank you very much.
Bob!
my man, Bobby!
this is Marsha.
come on! - I have bacon fat on my hands.
it's OK. I can wash it, shower in it, swim. Come on, give it a good pull!
I don't want to hurt you. - It's OK! I'm fine.
OK. - Ow, ow!
you picked a soft spot. - Sorry.
Gracie, mind the four-top over there, will you?
Yeah, I will.
OK, well, it was really nice to meet you.
good luck... with your hair. - Thank you.
Hey, Patrick. Wanna grab on with two hands and run for the door?
no, Ralph. I don't touch men. - It's women's hair.
and then I said, "It's Squeaker, my kitty!
everyone was laughing! Ah-ha-ha! Oh!
that's when I met Charlie. He was the only vet open.
funny story. - Where are the menus? What's going on?
squeaker won't let another vet touch him.
Yeah, well, I better not hear about anybody else touching your squeaker.
I didn't mean to say that.
I really like this place. It's nice. - Oh, well, if you like this kind of place.
everything here is good. That's the beauty of it.
Oh my gosh, look at us, matchy green. "Matchy matchy green squared!
I'll take care of that.
thank you very much.
could you hang this up behind you?
Yeah. - Thank you.
so, Rob, Charlie tells me you work at the zoo.
wait a minute - he doesn't work there. Bob is there building. Bob's a builder.
the new building on State Street? Bob's.
you own it? - No. No, I designed it.
Oh.
good evening.
no, no, no. Do you have bottled water?
sure. Anyone else?
may I have a wine list? - Sure.
do we know each other?
I think so. Have you been in here before?
I'd remember an lrish-ltalian restaurant. - Yeah, you would.
Oh, my God - blah, blah, blah. My water?
I don't want Swiss water. I got sick on that once, remember?
Ach, that was awful. That was so bad.
as long as it's not Swiss or tap water. Preferably French, no bubbles.
I want it cold - no ice, no glass, just the bottle and a straw.
do you want to write it down? I don't want Swiss water...
I'm pretty sure I got it.
I'm sorry. Can I get a coffee?
sure. - No straw.
I hate when they don't write it down. - It will be wrong.
maybe she'll get it right.
it's not gonna happen.
Nope, not me.
not me. - No.
I think your ass is ringing.
I usually don't bring it.
Rueland.
Mike! Excuse me, I gotta take this.
what do you think?
Patrick, can you gim me an Aquafina?
that's good, Mike. The welder can work four days for us and one day at the zoo.
either way they get paid under the original contract.
who else is on the clock?
um... no, no, that sounds good. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
hold on! Can you call me back in three minutes and whatever I say, disregard it?
Thanks.
so the old man goes, "How many times I gotta tell you,
I don't want no brown bananas?
wine lists. - That's a good one.
I bet that's refreshing. - Such a difference!
Yes. - There you go.
I'm doing a new food combination, so I don't need something...
our specials are chicken Vesuvio... - Please!
I'm around them all day.
I didn't mean to...
I'm a vet. You know?
and a corned beef and cabbage souffl? and a spinach ravioli, my favourite.
I'll have that. - That sounds so fattening.
well, just order something else. - Is every dish here cooked in oil?
no. Some we boil in Swiss water.
we're gonna need another minute. - OK.
we should get that smartass fired. - She's fine.
no, that is not fine. That was uncalled-for.
get out of the way, Patrick. - We're getting compliments on the pasta.
why wouldn't we? Angelo's the best ltalian chef in Chicago.
Angelo! Three more shepherd's pies, if you please.
Oh, that's me. That's mine.
Rueland. Hey, Mike.
I'm just havin' dinner.
no. No, that's not a problem.
if I have to be there I have to be there. See you in five minutes.
where? - The Wabash building.
they're working on a Friday night? - Can you believe that?
no. - It's an emergency. I gotta be there.
it was nice to meet you, Marla. - Marsha.
and Shari? - Yeah, that's it.
I apologise, and... have fun.
Bye.
is everything OK? - Oh, yeah. Fine. I just got called to work.
Oh, OK. Are your girlfriend and friends staying?
God, that's not my girlfriend. It's not even a friend. Not an acquaintance either.
Yes. They will be staying.
Oh. Hang on a second.
Soph, what is that? - Ravioli and a side cabbage for pickup.
here you go, Mr... Atsuki.
come back again.
thank you.
ticket, sir? Thank you, sir.
what are you doin'? - I got a call. I gotta go.
you're already out. It's Friday night. - I know.
drink some wine. Enjoy the evening.
I can't. I gotta go to work. I'm sorry.
thank you. - I know you're goin' home.
I'm not goin' home. I gotta go to work.
Yeah, yeah, right!
grace? Umbrella. - Oh. Thanks.
another set of keys. Oh...
I found this phone on the bar earlier. Nice, huh?
Bob.
according to these plans... are we only enclosing the one oak tree?
no, I got a newer set of plans in my office. We'll work Saturdays.
we are working Saturdays! - I'll get the new set of plans.
I'll take this home. My kids love colouring between the lines on these.
Hey, Bob, could I see the new plans? - Yeah. Sure. Right here.
these'll be the last set, right? - Yes.
Oh, yeah.
did anybody call back about my phone?
Oh, yeah, the restaurant. They have it.
who called? - The restaurant.
no, l... who from the restaurant? - I don't know. Some woman.
young or old? - I don't know!
I'll send one of the guys to go get it. - No, I'll swing by there later.
that's cute.
will you stop with the piano?
here's the baby pig pen. - OK.
the mommy has ten baby bottles coming out of her tummy.
that's cute.
stop with the piano!
Megan!
what? I'm not playing it. - But you...
what else did you see at the zoo?
then we went to see the gorillas and mommy said it was you.
Oh, I did not! I did not!
did she take you to see the elephants? - Watch it, Joe!
did you change him? - Yeah, I'm gonna.
get up and change him. What have you been doing?
I've been saving lives all day, honey. - Very funny.
I'll change him. - No, Grace, I got it.
Joe, get up and do it right now. - I got it, Grace. I'll do it.
Megan... - What?!
I invited Rudy over. To meet Grace.
father Rudy?
he's not a priest any more.
to me he always will be. Joe, she'll meet someone on her own.
where? She's here on every one of her nights off.
he's a nice guy. - It doesn't matter!
it's not easy to dance when no one's leading.
now help me clean up the puzzle!
here's the barn. Barn's gone! - What's goin' on?
nothing. Joe invited somebody over - Iike a blind date for you.
What?! - It's not a date.
he's comin' over for dinner, that's it.
I gotta find my scarf. - Better hurry!
I already told him you've had work done. - What?!
she's not a Buick.
he understands, he's OK with it. He's a priest!
a priest? - Yup.
an ex-priest. What's the big deal? He's never dated, you've never dated.
grace has dated. - Who? Chooch Patucci?
I never dated Chooch! - That's a date?
you dated Chooch Patucci?!
don't say that name in this house.
it's all right, Megan. - Do you hate priests, Aunt Grace?
no, honey. - Cos if you do you'll go straight to hell.
your mouth!
that's great, Joe. You taught him "hell." - I did not. You picked it up from Mom.
I never said "hell," you son of a bitch. - Just back off.
Oh, shit! Father Rudy's here.
don't say "shit" in front of the priest. - Shit! Shit!
would everyone just calm down, for the love of God and all that is holy?
calm the hell down!
stop playing that.
shut that thing off. - No, no... Dad...!
good night, Nurse!
for Christ's sake, he's just a man!
I'm not used to being without it yet, Joe.
come on in.
there she is. - Oh, boy!
dinner, I mean.
Hallelujah!
Bobby!
where you at?
you ran away last night, you don't show up tonight...
I'm sorry, Charlie, I'm just not feelin' up to it.
I don't know, maybe somethin' I ate.
I'm just going to... I'm gonna kick back, take it easy, maybe go to bed early.
what you doin'? - Now? Watching the Cubs game.
what's the score? - The score? Oh, it's, uh...
uh...
it's... the Cubs are losin'.
mr Rueland?
Dan the man!
Bob the slob - just kidding.
maybe you could clean up the place.
I don't think you could afford me.
how do I look?
tall.
tall.
tall, yeah.
Thanks.
Oh, Megan, it was fine. You know... He was a nice guy.
well, at least we had a few laughs. - Yeah, we did.
did you notice how he was afraid to even let me lift a plate of potatoes?
no, I think he was just being polite.
Mm-hm.
no, but it's like as soon as they know, they think of me as broken.
I think they see you as a kind, loving woman that's beaten unbeatable odds.
that's the way I see you. - Urrgghh!
OK, Tyler, come on!
the right guy will know. Trust me.
can't have Joe helping. The way he describes your surgery'd scare anyone!
tonight. They're asleep. We can do it!
what did he say?
he's saying he's sorry about tonight, so please forgive him.
left. Step up. Good boy.
daddy!
goddammit! - Oh, dear.
goddammit! - Megan!
I'm right here. Take it easy.
dad, I want some water. - You can't have water.
he can have water. - He'll wet the bed and who'll change it?
I do, damn it. - OK, potty mouth's gonna change it.
come on, honey, get up there. You're going to sleep- for ever!
stop, it'll be in their heads all night. - I'll put something in their heads!
dad, what are you doing? - I'm trying to put Mom to bed too.
grandpa, you need some help? - No darlin', not at all.
I'm blessed with work.
sweet dreams, Gracie Alana. - Good night, Grandpa.
best female singer.
dead or alive? - Either.
Ella Fitzgerald, easy. - Now I can agree with that.
I agree.
I still take Banks over Cobb. - Don't be ridiculous.
you can't mix your dream team from different eras.
is this a new rule? - You can't mix living and dead players.
ty Cobb was the greatest ball player ever.
a great player, but an animal. - I'd still take Ernie Banks over Ty Cobb.
know how many came to his funeral?
Joe DiMaggio was the classiest of them all.
apples and oranges - come on, guys. Compare short stop to short stop.
you are either very late or very early. What's your view of it?
I left my cellphone here. Somebody called back. A young lady?
I'll look for it. Come in and have a beer. - No, thanks.
have to get home to the wife, do you? - No.
you're... you're not married, then? - Mmm... No. Not really.
I hope she didn't walk out on you.
no. No, no, she passed away.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph, that's very sad.
Oh, I hate to hear that. But anyway...
I don't want to play in your yard
I don't like you anymore
you'll be sorry when you see me
sliding down our cellar door
you can't holler down our rain barrel
you can't climb our apple tree
I don't want to play in your yard
if you can't be good to me

after being abandoned by their abusive father...
are forced to fend for themselves...
when their depressive mother goes out on a date...
from which she never returns.

we're gonna have to go out there and filnd him.
we are not gonna have to go out there and filnd him.
Wendy, we are not in a Sam Shepard pIay.
we're gonna have to do something. This is a crisis.
look, l don't think this actuaIIy quaIifiles as a crisis.
lt's an aIarm, okay? But it's not a crisis, not yet.
you mean, it's Iike we're in Orange. What?
Yeah. Right, exactIy.
but we're in YeIIow, okay?
so we shouId just... be aware...
and be cautious.
and when it hits Red, then we're in troubIe.
okay?
your coIor, right? Ms. Metzger? Ravishing Red?
uh, right?
see? Good coIor, right?
sexy. Okay.
Oh, my goodness.
ms. Metzger?
Andy, it's me, Jon.

l'm, uh, stiII pIugging away on that Brecht book.
Yeah, weII, he's a compIex man. And you?
Oh, yeah, l heard Stanford's pIaying footsie with you.
that's great. Oh, great.
look, l need a favor.
weII, it's kind of Iast minute. l'm out of town, actuaIIy.
Arizona.
Yeah, it's a famiIy thing.
no, nothing serious. lt's my father.
no, he's just, uh his girIfriend died.
Yeah. And, uh, he's getting pretty oId himseIf, l guess, Iike everybody.
Yeah. weII, that's what l was gonna ask you.
lt's my 9: 00 a. m. on Monday.
'OedipaI Rage and Beckett, " of aII things.
l have to stop at baggage cIaim. HoId on. HoId on a second.
you checked Iuggage? We're onIy here for a day. Two days and one night.
excuse me if l pIan on changing my cIothes.
sorry. Uh, it's my sister.
l gained some weight. l didn't say anything.
kasia didn't have you pack a buttondown?
what is this, a goddamn fashion show? No.
lt's just, when someone dies, peopIe dress up.
she's moving back to PoIand.
what, you and Kasia broke up? Her visa expired.
so that's it? Her visa expires, so so it's over?
weII, it's either that or we get married...
and no one's ready for that, okay?
you've been together for over three years. You're 42 years oId wendy, l reaIIy don't need romantic advice from my IittIe sister at the moment.
let's just take care of the situation and stay out of each other's shit, okay?
l'm just trying to taIk about it.
weII, we're not in therapy right now. we're in reaI Iife.
Oh, here. l aImost forgot. Shoot. we have to sign this.
they didn't have a very big seIection. ls this okay?
'these words, we hope, may ease your Ioss.
'our prayers are with you, our Iove, our thoughts.
so this is sent with some "
here.
don't forget the baIIoon.
you must be Leonard's kids.
Uhhuh.
the hospitaI's just filve minutes away.
and don't worry. lt's nothing serious.
he's been feeIing kind of faint...
and what with the toiIeting incident and aII...
the doctor thought a few tests were in order.
weII, l guess l guess we shouId be going then.
we're reaIIy sorry about your mom. Oh, thank you.
uh, Jon, wendy
one more thing before you go.
pIease sit.
l just want to say...
you know, we Iove Lenny.
he's been Iike famiIy to us, but...
he's not reaIIy our famiIy he's yours.
so...
l hope you'II be abIe to filnd somepIace nice for him.
what do you mean? She means a pIace where he can Iive.
right. He Iives here. That's correct.
your father's been Iiving off the charity of our famiIy for quite some time.
biII Why wouId you say charity, BiII?
Doris asked my father to come Iive with her as a boyfriend, not a boarder.
they were a coupIe. They were together for over 20 years.
you can't just throw the man out on the street.
he has a right to live here.
legally speaking, it's a common lawmarriage at this point.
not exactIy.
not in front of the kids, BiII.
let's step outside.
so, was Lenny there when this was signed?
notarized, aII IegaI.
it's called a nonmarital agreement.
it's like a prenup without the nup.
lt says that even though they Iived together...
they have no IegaI obIigation to each other, that everything's separate.
and, basicaIIy, Dad has no IegaI right to any of her property.
bet you they've aIready got the pIace Iisted.
did you notice that there wasn't one picture of us anywhere?
are you surprised?
lt's Iike we don't even exist.
Wow!
add a scoop to every Ioad and see for yourseIf.
it's tough on stains, safe on colors.
and Oxy Clean still works great on carpet and upholstery.
call now, and you'll receive a whopping six pound where the heII have you been? Hi, Dad.
Hi, Dad. How are you? How are you?
they had me hogtied for two days.
we got here as soon as we could.
we came straight from the airport. ltlt's Jon and Wendy.
l know who you are.
the Iate ones. You're Iate.
you weren't here, and this is what they do, see?
dad You weren't here, l said! Nobody!
go get somebody.
we weren't here 'cause we Iive on the East Coast.
remember? Yeah?
we haven't seen you in a Iong time. We're here to heIp you.
so do something! You're the doctor!
l'm gonna go get somebody.
he's not that kind of doctor, Dad. HeHe's a professor.
l thought my boy was a doctor.
doctor of PhiIosophy.
PhD. Teaches coIIege.
medicine?
no.
drama.
he teaches theater. Like Broadway?
no, Iike... theater of sociaI unrest.
stuff Iike that.
he's doing a book onon BertoIt Brecht.
l'II reIease him onIy if he promises to be good.
we can't have him get out of bed by himseIf.
are you going to be good, Mr. Savage?
are you going to be good, Dad?
you're not good, they won't let you go.
you can't keep puIIing on everything.
this is for your own good.
this is your food.
we don't want him cIimbing out on his own.
he's unsteady. He can faII. We'II keep an eye on him.
thank you.
vascular dementia or multiinfarct...
usuaIIy foIIow one or more strokes...
but l am not seeing any sign of a stroke here.
but the disinhibition, the aggression, masked facies with a bIank stare that we had taIked about earIier, are aII fairIy good indicators.
ls it Iike AIzheimer's?
there are a lot of illnesses that can cause dementia.
I'm not prepared to make a diagnosis yet, but I think...
his symptoms are much more characteristic of Parkinson's disease.
so, what do we have to Iook forward to?
well, he's not a young man, so cardiac or respiratory failure may spare him...
from the worst of it, but, uh, tremors when the limb is at rest...
a shuffling walk, freezing up, unable to initiate movement...
more and more loss of motor coordination in general.
you make me feel so young
you make me feel like spring has sprung
and every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy individual
the moment that you speak
I want to go play hide and seek
I want to go and bounce the moon
just like a toy balloon
you and l
are just Iike a coupIe of tots
running across the meadow
picking up
maybe Dad didn't abandon us.
maybe he just forgot who we were.
l'm gonna give Brian Deener a caII. Who's that?
he's a friend of mine, teaches in the EngIish department.
he just put his mother in a nursing home near campus.
couId we have some more nuts?
nursing home? Yeah. what?
l wasn't thinking about putting him in a nursing home.
what were you thinking?
l don't know, but l wasn't thinking that.
where eIse is he gonna Iive?
l mean, reaIIy, what's the aIternative? You want to You want to change dad's diapers, wipe his ass?
he doesn't need diapers.
what do you think that catheter was? He's in the hospitaI.
you make me feel
but Iook, even if they did Iet dad stay here...
he'd stiII have to have somebody take care of him. we can't afford that.
you heard the nurse. Dad faIIs. He's disoriented.
he hasn't faIIen once since we've been here.
don't make me out to be the eviI brother who's putting away our father against your wiII.
aII right, we're doing this together, right?
two of a kind for your information we're two of a kind well, there's places.
what pIaces? Like Aunt Gertie.
that's assisted Iiving. l'm not sure Dad wouId get into one of those.
Gertie's pretty independent, remember? She's aIso rich.
okay, so l'm gonna caII United...
and try to get the filrst flight out filrst thing tomorrow...
get back and see if l can filnd a pIace that'II take him.
what am l gonna do?
you're gonna stay here and hoId down the fort untiI l filnd something.
by myseIf?
Wendy, this is not the time to regress.
I just don't know if it's something that I can do...
and so I just don't talk.
I don't knowhowlong he'll be gone, you don't knowhowlong you'll be gone.
and that's just not something I think I can deal with by talking on the phone every couple weeks.
we can taIk more about this when l get home.
tomorrow morning.
I'll make sure to call when I get in.
okay. Bye.
Hey, Wendy? Wen?
