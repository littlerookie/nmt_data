igawa and the yankees have agreed in principle on a five-year,$ 20 million contract, but there are still some details to be ironed out.
igawa had been skipped in the rotation because of his own erratic performance.
igawa has been a project for guidry this season, an odd intersection of igawa's japanese culture and guidry's cajun twang, both mixing in the hopes of retiring major league hitters consistently.
igawa is expected to arrive in new york and take his physical on wednesday, though the yankees may not officially announce a deal with the pitcher until after the holidays.
igawa walked three and struck out two before leaving the field to a chorus of boos, which he later claimed that he did not know were meant for him.
igawa was sent to class a tampa after a may 4 start against the seattle mariners at yankee stadium in which he was battered for eight runs in four innings, including three home runs.
igawa, who was touted as a long-term asset by cashman on the day he was introduced to the new york media in january, said that he was aware a reassignment to the minor leagues could be a possibility when he signed his contract with the organization.
