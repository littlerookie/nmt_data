haggis made a similar choice in real life with his best friend, who was brain dead from a staph infection.
haggis mined the experience for the script of "million dollar baby," in which the lead character, played by clint eastwood, is haunted by his estrangement from his daughter.
haggis opened the book and saw a page stamped with the words "church of scientology."
haggis refused to let the matter drop.
haggis responded that, because the auditing took place over a number of years, it was easy to believe that he might actually be smarter and wiser because of it, just as that might be true after years of therapy.
haggis said that, at the time, he had chosen not to learn the details of mcpherson's death. "I had such a lack of curiosity when I was inside," haggis said.
haggis says that when he appeared on the set spielberg pulled him aside.
haggis soon found on youtube the video of tommy davis talking on cnn about disconnection.
haggis told celebrity that he had recently gone through the purification rundown, a program intended to eliminate body toxins that form a "biochemical barrier to spiritual well-being."
haggis wasn't proud of his early years.
haggis's experience in scientology, though, was hardly egalitarian: he accepted the privileges of the celebrity centre, which offers notables a private entrance, a v. i. p.lounge, separate facilities for auditing, and other perks.
