that is nowhere near enough to absorb investor demand-even assuming that buyers could get used to relying on corporate, rather than government, credit.

that is of considerable interest to france. Consultants at mckinsey calculate that with the number of super-rich worldwide growing by 8% a year, annual sales of french luxury goods could double to euro 42 billion over the next ten years.

that is one reason why decentralised market processes tend to work well.

that is partly because in canada-as in the united states, but unlike in europe-unions negotiate by workplace rather than across an industry.
that is partly because it was such a mess during segregation, but also because so many southerners have since tried so hard to make integration work.
that is partly because job losses and other cost cuts have provided a cushion for corporate profits.
that is partly because land occupations have deterred investment, says mr araneda.
that is partly because many companies have mandatory retirement ages, but even in politics or the arts, 60 or 65 is often presumed to be a natural cut-off point.
that is partly because many poor people would not gain (since they do not work); partly because some of the costs of higher minimum wages are shifted onto poor consumers; but mainly because many minimum-wage workers are not poor.
that is partly because merchants must upgrade their cash-register systems to handle the chip-based cards.
that is partly because most businesses loathe uncertainty, and european ones are now having to rejig contracts with foreign suppliers and recalibrate investment plans.
that is partly because mr gauck's unabashed defence of freedom, of the economic as well as the political sort, fits well with the fdp's liberal principles (it is more surprising that the social democrats and greens support him).
that is partly because murders are common.
that is partly because muslim countries, along with various non-democracies with a soft spot for tyrants, hold a majority of the council's 47 seats; between them they are shielding the khartoum regime.

that is partly because the private sector expanded rapidly during the 2004-08 oil boom. But it is also because many nationalised companies now produce less than when they were in private hands.
that is partly because the really lavish perks of the dotcom boom concierges, masseuses and elaborate break rooms vanished in the early 2000s and have never really returned.
that is partly because the region's economies are now doing well again (see article), but it is also because some democrats seem to have learnt a salutary lesson. This is that governments neglect education, health and anti-poverty programmes at their peril.

that is partly because voters are weary of costly wars with messy and uncertain outcomes.
that is partly because, as in any gold rush, some unscrupulous entrepreneurs have cut corners on staffing, and regulations have evolved belatedly.
that is partly thanks to competition, as chinese entrepreneurs have rushed to set up websites to exploit any pricing inefficiency.

that is perhaps why the release of the ndrc reform directive failed to excite chinese financial markets last week.
that is philip levy's intriguing argument in a new aei working paper, "economic integration and incipient democracy."

that is presenting an opportunity for investors to buy what others are fleeing.
that is presumably tonic to the real culprit for the hunger, the chubby dear leader, kim jong il.

that is pretty rad, but, like, let's say Ted calls him and is like:
that is pretty rediculous! I am not a complicated person.

that is probably one reason why creating a systemic-risk council made up of all of the federal government's financial regulatory agencies, including the fed, has the support of senate banking committee chairman christ dodd (d., conn.) and others on the committee.
that is probably one risk not worth taking.
that is probably quite a deadly wheel.

that is probably the iceman.
that is probably the most unintuitive
that is probably the toughest song of the night vocally as well.
