alfa unit? Russian special forces.
you're saying that somebody had these guys take over a hotel just to capture you?
not me. This.
what is this?
trust me.
if Shaw didn't tell you, you're better off not knowing.
the package is my responsibility.
your mission is to get me out of here.
not that I don't believe you.
hold on.
this is Shaw.
when were you gonna tell me that there was another CIA agent in the hotel?
you found her.
Yes, I found her.
you're lucky I didn't shoot her.
I need to know if the agent is still in possession of the package.
Yeah, she's got it.
and I'm guessing you're not gonna tell me what it is.
you guessed correctly.
your priority is to make sure that agent Anderson and the package get to safety.
call me when you're done.
let me tell you
let's go.
agent Bloom, looks like Shin Bet just gave upon sneaking into the hotel.
they're going through the front door at sundown.
you need to get out of there now.
you find Mrs. Agent Bloom, and you abort the mission.
you do not want to get caught in the middle of a firefight.
change of plans, Hoyt.
you need to get down to the tunnel now.
we've got a priority extraction to make.
that's what I just said.
not me.
it's a CIA agent.
our mission is to get her to safety.
I - I don't understand.
I'm gonna explain to you when I'm done saving my wife.
wait, you're not leaving, too?
it's up to you to take care of agent Anderson.
I'm giving her my earwigso you can lead her to the exit point.
agent Hoyt will be able to guide you out of the hotel with this.
Now...come on keep it. You'll need it upstairs.
okay. Tell Hoyt I'll be back with Samantha.
Hey! - No, no, no, no, please!
please! No, no, no, no! Please, listen to me, please!
I'm American.
there's a lot of people at my company willing to pay a lot of money to see me alive.
please, don't. Don't. Don't.
okay, okay, okay. Okay, no, please.
please, okay. Okay.
okay, agent Anderson...
go to the southwest corner. I'll guide you from there.
copy that.
it is tight in here.
clean him up.
are you okay?
what happened?
just what I wanted to happen.
that looks awful.
it's just a lot of blood, but it's really not that deep.
I was talking about your shirt.
look, Steven, these people aren't who they say they are.
I heard them speaking - Russian?
Yes. How'd you know?
I had a run-in with one of them.
they're all ex-special OPS.
they came here looking for somebody-one of ours.
she's carrying something important.
wait, she's CIA?
Shaw decided to leave that part out.
Hoyt's exfiling her as we speak.
I can't believe you let yourself get captured.
what were you thinking?
when I lost your signal,
I thought something happened.
quick, turn off your earwig. They have a scanner.
they tracked me through my comms.
I gave my earwig to the special agent.
damn it.
they're tracking her now.
okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, just like the presidential fitness test-You can do this.
what's that? - I said I'm on my way.
I'm at the southwest corner.
what now?
take a right.
bill Hoyt, at your service.
what do you say you and I get out of here?
afternoon.
you must be the food inspector I spoke to on the phone.
come in.
is someone baking apple pie?
Yes, for the holidays.
redmond, office of the inspector general.
are we secure in here? We need to get to work.
uh, both the employees and the blooms have been taken care of - The place is all yours.
perfect.
that's what this is all about
sweeping the place for bugs?
do you have any idea how many bugs I've found in my career?
I'm sorry they forced you to come down here.
no, we're not looking for bugs, Mr. Shaw
in fact, quite the opposite.
we have about 15 minutes before Shin Bet comes in here firing.
Oh, no. - Oh, yes.
Hoyt heard they're planning a raid.
it'll be a bloodbath in here.
Aw, man.
is that
the undercover agent we were supposed to protect.
somehow, they got to her first.
what about the package? You think it's still on her?
I don't know why it wouldn't be.
I told you to bring the target to me alive.
she was escaping. I had no choice.
it's useless...
now that you killed the one person who knew where the file is hidden.
there was someone helping her.
they cut a hole in the basement.
they must have sent an extraction team to get her out of the hotel.
that last guest, the one you found hiding.
who are you?
I'm-I'm Dennis Archer.
room number? - Excuse me? What?
what room are you staying in?
look, I-I'm not staying here. I don't have a room, okay?
I was just in Tel Aviv for the day, here at-at the hotel f- for the tech conference.
look, if you want ransom, you can call my office.
I'm the - The V. P. of marketing at a small I. T. Company out of Texas.
you're the dead woman's partner.
you killed my missing men, didn't you?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
you're CIA. - What? That's crazy.
tell me who you are and who sent you here.
I told you, I'm here on business, okay?
you got to believe me.
the best case, I will get rid of a CIA agent.
the worst case, I kill an innocent man.
I can live with that.
he's with me.
then you're both CIA...
what a touching sacrifice.
perhaps...
you two are more than just partners...
it would be so easy to make you tell me everything I want to know.
but it's time to go.
don't you think I know about the Shin Bet commando raid outside?
Yes.
Yes, we have walkies too.
they should be here any minute.
then you know you and your men aren't getting out of this hotel alive?
you have no idea...
how right you are.
agent Bloom, Mrs. Agent Bloom, you guys have to get out of there now!
do you hear me? You have to get out of there now!
with all due respect, since when are we in the business of bugging our own agents?
perhaps you've forgotten the reason we reactivated the blooms, Mr. Shaw.
of course not, sir, but during their short tenure back with the agency, the Blooms have been nothing but loyal.
then they have nothing to hide.
was there anything else, Mr. Shaw?
you should also know that the Blooms are aware of the real reason they're in Tel Aviv, why we sent them into the hotel.
they know about the package?
how did they find out?
like I said, they're good agents.
I'll be in touch.
if you're gonna kill us, kill us.
why would I kill you?
you're my ticket out of here.
this is a message to Shin Bet.
be advised.
they're letting the hostages go.
tell your men to stand down.
thank you, doctor.
you were such a convincing businessman.
well, now let's see if you can play a terrorist.
no, it doesn't make any sense.
why would they just let the hostages go?
you can try something if you want, but I can't guarantee my finger won't twitch.
I'll be in touch.
Hello, everyone!
could I have your attention?
everybody's free to go!
the front doors are open!
the last one from the ballroom gets a bullet in the head!
go, go!
go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
go, go, go, go!
do it now, or she dies!
keep moving.
keep your mouth shut, and I won't shoot you.
go, now!
that way!
don't shoot!
don't shoot.
go! Start the car!
start the car!
I know the cuffs are tight, sir.
I'm sorry, but I needed to make it look real.
give me your keys.
what? - I said,"give me your keys.
I'm commandeering your vehicle for prisoner transport.
is this a joke?
I've got four dead terrorists in that hotel, 100 hostages with 100 different stories, and I need to get this guy to H. Q.
to explain what the hell just happened.
the fact that you're holding me up right now, that is a joke.
give me your keys.
get out of here.
where to, sir?
where do you think he's taking Mrs. Agent Bloom?
I wish I knew.
you know what this is.
I need to know what it opens.
I need to know what it opens.
either you take me to it, or you're no longer useful to me, you understand?
all right, all right.
that key opens a locker in a storage facility.
it's Sam. - Yeah.
she's in a vehicle with a radio and turned it on.
it's in a warehouse in the Ramat Aviv district, across from the groningen gardens.
we can be there in five minutes.
good, good. Then let's go there.
I know where those gardens are.
how far? - More than five minutes.
what's taking so long?
I thought you knew where you were going.
it's been five years. - Come on, come on.
this one.
let's hope you're right. Unlock it.
it's not too late, you know.
open the locker.
you can still walk away, tell whoever you're working for it was empty.
and why would I do that?
I don't think you want to know what's inside this locker.
whatever it is, it has a way of getting people killed.
open the locker.
I knew the man who owned this locker.
he was a good man, a good agent.
he died for what's in here.
what makes you think things will turn out any differently for you?
you are saying I die if I open it, and I say, you're gonna die right now if you don't.
open the locker.
empty the locker.
I'll take that.
Sam! Sam! Are you okay?
I'm...
fine.
let's see what all this was about.
I'll take it from here.
who are you?
you can call me kelvin, Agent bloom.
wait.
you're the one who was running agent Anderson.
this is your mission? - A shame what happened to her.
she was a very valuable asset.
if you don't mind...
thank you for your fine work, Mr. and Mrs. Bloom.
it's nice to have you back in the fold.
I'm Bill Hoyt, also in the fold with these guys.
so this is it, huh?
no explanation for what you put us through?
there is one more thing.
you two were never in Tel Aviv.
no one is to ever know what happened here.
as far as the CIA is concerned, you two had a five-day vacation in Athens.
understood?
what's this about an inspector and you giving our employees the week off?
news travels fast.
Charlie left about a dozen messages.
did we get shut down?
don't worry. I personally took care of the inspector.
when you say "took care of..."
no, I didn't kill him, Mrs. Bloom.
I just made sure he gave you an "a.
great. - Hmm.
thank you.
Mr. Kelvin also gave you an A for your performance in Tel Aviv, so congratulations all around.
so Kelvin told you about- - No, he did not debrief me as to the details of your mission.
neither will you, Mrs. Bloom.
all I know is that my boss is satisfied, and when my boss is satisfied, then I am satisfied.
I never took you for a baker.
you have no idea the things I can do, Mrs. Bloom.
enjoy the pie.
do you mind?
what, you got somewhere to be?
no. I just don't feel like listening to you complain.
well, you might not want to listen, but I'm gonna talk.
we came back to help the agency, Mr. Shaw, and we will walk away if you ever pull something like this again.
you send us on a mission, you tell us everything.
we're not putting our lives in danger so you and Kelvin can sit there and play these little CIA mind games.
you sent us into that hotel with only half the picture.
and yet you and your wife managed to protect both the hostages and the best interests of the CIA, end of discussion.
an agent died in Tel Aviv protecting your interests.
what do you want? You want me to say I'm sorry?
I want you to tell me it was worth it!
I want you to tell me what was in that locker!
I'm sorry. I can't tell you that.
Hey.
you look like you could use a drink.
that's very greek of you.
to the last time we ever let the CIA send us on a vacation.
so why do you think shaw didn't tell us?
I don't know why, but it's the CIA.
they're hardly a paragon of honesty.
I mean, do you ever wonder why they even asked us back in the first place?
you mean other than to save Leo?
we hadn't seen Leo in five years.
any team of agents could have saved him, just like any team of agents could have been sent into that hotel.
but it was us.
and you think you know why?
I don't know why.
but I do know what was in that locker.
how?
because I put it there with Shilling five years ago, right before he got killed.
that's how you knew where to go.
Yep.
shilling never told me what he was working on, said it was for my protection.
all I know is that it was part of a program called operation nocturne.
operation nocturne?
they ship it. Wheel turns.
no more bets, please. No more bets.
look at that. - Oh, look at that.
hit me, right? - No, stick.
stick? I have 14.
stick. Stick.
you just told Eleanor to take a card and she had 18.
trust me on this one. Just stick.
Oh, Saul, stop being so paranoid.
she's not trying to cheat you out of cookies.
besides, they're not good for your blood sugar, right?
my blood sugar is just fine.
Oh, really? It's fine?
this morning, it was 223.
yesterday, it was 220, 245, 262 and 250.
that's not so fine, Mr. Wanamaker.
got ya.
Hey, thought you were starting your new job today.
Shh. She's concentrating.
she's counting cards.
Hey, don't be such a sore loser, Keith.
Hey, did you say anything?
no, not yet.
21! Blackjack!
Blackjack!
I got to take this.
okay, I'll be right there.
excuse me, miss, can I help you?
I'm with homicide. - Sure you are.
she's with me.
this isn't Syracuse.
people sort of dress the part around here.
I told you I don't do pantsuits.
how's your mom? - She's good.
you should come by and see her sometime. She always liked you.
I don't exactly remember it that way.
so...
what do we got? A couple... Joel and Ann Seiferth, each took one to the head and chest in their kitchen.
who called it in? - Woman who works for the husband.
came by when he didn't show.
Nina got her statement. - Hey, Mike.
detective.
any witnesses? It's forest hills. Everyone's at work trying to pay off their big houses.Or fix 'em up.
looks like they're doing construction.
the ghost whisperer finally showed.
that means we can go home now?
so where we at?
well, M. E. puts time of death about two hours ago.
we spoke to the security company.
the alarm system was off and no evidence of forced entry.
so maybe someone they knew? Could be the construction crew.
they usually get a key. - Lunchtime.
middle of the day...
the door could have been unlocked. And definitely signs of a struggle.
husband's got a bruise on his cheek.
and check this... no jewelry and all the tv's are gone.
got tech. Cell phone.
okay, bag the hands. Get 'em over to the lab.
if the husband tried to fight off the killer, we may be able to get some DNA.
Where's the kid? Oh, Max Seiferth, seven years old.
the schedule on the fridge says he had t- today.
children's services is on it.
that's a kid who's going to hate baseball.
okay, let's start with anyone who's had access to the house.
day laborers, plumbers, nannies, housekeepers.
and let's talk to the kid.
what is it, Carrie?
here we go again!
the tarp.
it moved.
wait a second... - Wait right here.
I don't think he's at T-ball.
Hey, it's okay Max.
joel and Ann Seiferth.
she was an anesthesiologist at St. Michael's and Joel owned a string of gym bams.
who would want to kill a gym bam guy? what?
it's a kids' gym.You know, ball pits, trampolines, and...
my sister does parties for the twins.
what do we have on the gun? Uh, nine millimeter.
ballistics are pending. No prints yet.
DNA? - Doesn't look like we got any.
what about access to the house?
I talked to the contractor, and we're still trying to run down some of the day laborers, but he said they haven't been there in over six months.
said the family just ran out of money, put the whole thing on hold.
how does an anesthesiologist run out of money? Aren't those guys loaded?
not if they're not working.
I spoke to hr over at St. Mike's. Ann's been on leave for almost eight months.
what about Max? Anything new?
according to his school, he was home sick.
he's got two living relatives... An aunt and an uncle.
Ann's sister Liza, her husband Erik.
she's on her way in, he's out of town.
we know if he saw anything? He's in shock. Hasn't said a word.
either way, let's keep this low.
no one needs to know there might be a witness.Okay, Mike, get on the financials.
if money was tight, let's find out how tight.
Nina, Roe, check out St. Michael's.-I'm on it, Al.
I'm going to go talk to Max.
you sure? Yeah. I'm fine.
Carrie, whatever happened to your sister?
you can tell us. It's okay.
let's get her some more juice.
Hey, Max.
I'm going to sit down next to you, if that's okay.
Oh, you should watch this part.
it's funny. It's when steam comes out his... ears.
actually, it's not really that funny.
and you don't have to watch this just because they put it on.
you can watch anything you like.
um... what time is it? 3: 47.
you could watch Phineas and Ferb.
you could watch Naruto.You could watch Bakugan.
no wait, Bakugan's on at 4: 30.
you're right.
you have any video games?
uh, what kind of video games do you like?
angry birds.
smack talk.
smack talk?
wow, smack talk, that's um... What is that?
there's a hamster named Smack.
he records what you say.
makes you sound weird.
that sounds cool.
my mom lets me play when I'm sick.
Hi, Max.
I'm Elaine.
I'm Dr. Margulies, with children's services.
Oh, uh, Carrie Wells.
hello.
so, Max and I, we were just talking about video games.
right, Max?
Really?
um, detective,can I talk to you for a minute?
could we get him some more juice?
I'll be right back, okay?
you know, I was just getting him to open up in there, and...
look, I know you're new here.
let me start over.
um, I'm Elaine.
you know, Al's Elaine.
Oh. Yeah.
well, it's nice to meet you, Elaine.
you, too.
so anyway, um, I'm sure that you did things very differently in Syracuse, but here, we prefer to have a mental health professional present during interviews with small children.
okay. Sorry.
no, it's okay. It's been ten years.
nine, actually, but you know, who's counting.
sorry.
no, it's... hey, a lot has changed, I'm sure.
and, uh, and you just got here.Which Al is so happy about.
you two have met. Good.
I didn't realize the rotation was off, with the long weekend. So...
apparently, I've already broken a rule, but now I know.
you know, tell me once, I never forget.
so I've heard. - Oh.
I'm Max's aunt. Where is he?
he's... He's right in here.
he's being very quiet, but he's okay. I'll take you in.
there are ten psychologists... - Al, it's fine.
I understand you have a girlfriend.
I just didn't realize she was a shrink. I know what you're thinking.
what? That "psychology's a waste of time and money
wow, so many rules here. And by the way, I agree with you.
shrinks never did me any good.-I'm not in it for the free therapy.
want to know why the wife wasn't working?
wrongful death lawsuit:
19-year-old kid went in for routine surgery and never woke up. Seiferth was supervising.
it wasn't Ann's fault.
the patient had an atypical anaphylaxis.
it's a rare allergic response to anesthesia.
the body goes into shock. Completely unforeseeable.
but the hospital didn't see it that way.-I tried convincing them.
as head of the department, I need Ann.
she is one... was... One of our best people.
but the patient's family are longtime supporters of St. Michael's.
they demanded that she be suspended pending a full internal inquiry.
crazy thing is, the panel just came back with their report.
Ann was cleared and planning to come back next week.
interesting timing.
I imagine the family must not have been too happy about that.
look, right after the surgery, emotions were... very raw.
in these situations, families want to blame someone.
what about other people in the hospital?
she have any enemies you know of?
no. Everyone loved her.
Yeah, she's a tough act to follow.
Thanks, guys.
uh, I don't know if this is anything, but I keep going back to it.
Ann and I have known each other forever.
we went through residency together.
I was at her wedding.
but in the past few months, she and Joel started having problems.
he gambled. Just sports, I think.
I have no idea how bad it was or what he owed, but...
she mention who he owed it to? No.
God, I wish I had asked.
okay, thanks. We'll call you back.
joel was in it up to his ears. Mostly sports book.
if this is a front for gambling, it's genius.
Yeah. Detective. - Hey.
sorry to bother you at work. We just have a few more questions.
Olivia's the one who called it in.
when he didn't show up earlier, I just, I knew that something was wrong. And I tried to close today, but we have three birthday parties, and I just, I couldn't reach everybody
on my own, and...
joel would have laughed.
he was all about the kids.
seems like you really cared about him.
he was an amazing boss.
he'd totally just take you under his wing and...
did you know about his gambling?
is that what you think this is about?
did you ever hear any names of bookies or...?
No! I mean, sometimes, I'd find 'em in the back, online, stressing about some team that was losing.
what about payments?
was he ever late with payroll, vendors, anything like that?
nothing major. Business was good.
he'd even open up his gyms to schools and birthday parties for needy kids.
tika, honey, we're at a gym.
you're not playing on the phone right now.
but I just want to get to the next level.
cell phone.
there was a hamster named "Smack.
he records what you say.
he was home sick that day, right?
now, he told me that when he's sick, he's allowed to play with his mother's phone.
okay.
okay, we dumped this phone for calls.
but Henry said the last activity on the phone during the time of the murders was a game called "Smack talk.
my nephew plays that.It makes you sound like a gerbil.
a hamster, actually.
okay, so the question is, in hamster world, what does this sound like to you?
gunshots.
gunshots. He recorded the murder.
wait, wait a minute.But the phone was found downstairs.
okay, so... so he's upstairs, he's playing smack talk, he hears something going on in the kitchen, he comes down the stairs to check it out,sees what he sees, and in the shock of it, he... drops the phone.
which is why it was found at the bottom of the stairs.
where he had a direct view to the kitchen where the bodies were found.
he kept playing the game the whole time?
no. See, that's the thing.
smack talk, you touch the screen, it records for 45 seconds.
he saw the killer. We gotta talk to him.
Dr. Margulies said they'd prefer to have a psychologist present.
right. Is that, like, a department thing?
I think it's up to the individual case worker.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
cool.
Thanks.
Hey, Max.
do you mind if I, uh, sit down?
so I got that game you were telling me about, smack talk.
and it's cool. It's addictive, actually.
Max, is that the game that you were... playing...?
Lisa? - I'm home!
what's going on in here?
Max? Max? - What's going on?
what are you doing here? What happened? Max?
nothing happened. Relax. He was fine a few minutes ago.
you just stay away from my nephew. I was just asking him a few... There's no...
No! No more questions. - Look, I...
get out.
get out!
okay. I'm going.
al, I'm telling you, when his Uncle walked into the room, Max was terrified.
except the Uncle was on a business trip at the time of the murder, no?
three hours away in Hartford. We're into it, but he could have easily driven back.
how about a motive?
maybe he borrowed money from the in-laws, and enough is enough.
maybe Uncle Erik is actually the husband's bookie for all we know.
you guys know India's palace? Takeout place over on Vernon.
someone from the victim's house called there every Friday at 6: 45... I mean, every Friday night.
they like curry?
no, they love to gamble.
friday night's when you place college sports bets.
I dabble.
what, so, it's like, "I'll take the chicken tandoori and ten points on Ohio state"?
I've heard stranger. Roe, take Carrie, check it out.
what? You dabble.
no, what about the uncle? Nina and Mike will check him out.
no. Al, listen to me.
this kid, he could be living with his parents' murderer.
and isn't it also possible his parents are dead this is the guy he's gonna have to live with now.
he sees him first time since the murder, and he freaks out?
how very Dr. Phil of you, detective.
okay, find me something... A motive maybe, a weapon.
I'm all over it.
Carrie, could you...?
have said something? No.
these are complex, difficult situations.Which is why you should have waited...
waited for Elaine? She asked to be present at every interview.
that's because she doesn't trust me.
Oh, that...
that's because she's determined that she's dealing with an unstable detective who's so messed up by a past trauma, that she would detonate the first chance she gets.\NShe never used the word "detonate.
all right, truth:
What'd you tell her about me?
what? Nothing. - Hmm.
okay, maybe I might have said something about your paranoid persecution fantasies.
and, oh, yeah, she knows about that time at the bus station.
al, I'm telling you I saw that kid.
when his uncle walked in the room, he acted like he was afraid for his life.
I'm not making this up because my sister was killed. I'm not.
okay, look, we'll stay on the uncle. No more unannounced visits to Max.
fine, fine.
and, um, it was a train station in Utica in a phone booth.
remember those?
do I look like a guy who knows his sports?
I am from India.Ever hear of Jimmy the Greek?
he was from Ohio. -And you're from Jackson Heights.
why was Joe Seiferth calling here every Friday?
he liked my parents' food.
okay, so if you don't do sports book, I guess you got no interest in a tip on the Alabama-Florida game.
what do you know about football?
alabama, total yards per game versus AP teams, 221 versus BCS-ranked teams, 167. 2.
completion percentages...Who are you?
it's a really good tip?
okay. Maybe I knew him.
how much was he into you for?
by the time he got to me, he was already on his ass;
no cash at all.
watches, cufflinks and then, a couple weeks ago, he shows up with 100 grand and wants USC over Arizona.
Where'd he get the money?-Well, that's the thing.
I told him not to go to this guy.
honestly, Arizona kicks that field goal in sudden death, my first thought was about Joel's kneecaps.
Sami... a name?
what about my tip?
what you got on Alabama-Florida this weekend?
line's got Florida a six-point dog.
except the real dog...Alabama's quarterback.
Oh, come on. That's my tip?
the guy is fast-tracked to win the Heisman.
the guy is from Tacoma.\NHe can't play in the heat.
he's one and 12 since high school if it's over 90 at kick off.
seven interceptions, only four touchdowns. 16. 2 passing rating.
and FYI, it's supposed to be over 100 in Tuscaloosa this weekend.
okay, fine.
but this never left my lips because if it comes out that I gave him to you, I won't have lips.
okay.
before I talk to Carrie, she won't see Max again without your supervision.
and that I thought it was foolish to let her anywhere near that little boy.
and now... We don't know what happened. Because I wasn't there.
because you weren't there, maybe it was the uncle who frightened him.
okay, you really believe that?
maybe her experience makes Carrie exactly the right person to talk to him.
you're not supposed to defend an ex-girlfriend to your present girlfriend.
there's a reason Carrie and I didn't work.
I just wish she wasn't so pretty.
Yeah, Mike.
turns out the uncle has a gun permit.
so I followed up with my buddy at the license division.
it's a Beretta px4 nine millimeter. Same as the murder weapon.
Yeah, well, Carrie and I are talking to him now.
great.
what did I tell you?
Mr. Newsome. Max is inside with my wife.
we finally got him to eat something.-Well, we're not here about Max.
we just wanted to ask you a couple of questions about a gun you purchased.
what? What about it?
well, now you have a child in the house, so we... we'd like to see it.
you know, make sure it's locked up and secure.-t's secure, okay?
it's not even in the house.-So where is it?
I lent it to a friend.-His neighborhood had a string of burglaries.
how convenient.
Vance Williams, Orange, New Jersey. You want to ask him?
what made you want to purchase a gun in the first place?
to protect my wife.
two years ago, she was being harassed at work.
wow, that seems kind of extreme, no?
I mean, most people, they just go to human resources.
okay, we're done here.
look, Mr. Newsome... I'm calling my lawyer.
uh, Mr. Newsome.
she's a paralegal.
she's at, uh, Claman and Somerstein in the city.
Nina, uh, see... see what you can dig up about that gun.
uh, usually.
Yeah, I thought so. I got this. No.
uh, you can't...
Hey, buddy.
you mind if I talk to you for a second? What's up?
I'm with, uh, NYPD, actually.
I was just wondering if I could see what you got in the bag there.
drop it!
Thanks.
Mr. Kunis.
detective Saunders, how you doing?
you bringing me new talent?
Yeah, I'm not that flexible.
this is detective Inara.
this guy a friend of yours?
never seen him before.
and you're not going to see him again.
he tried to take out a witness today in flushing.
didn't go so well for him.
that's too bad.
we know you don't like to get your hands dirty and that Joel Seiferth was into you for 100 grand.
200, actually.
then he and his wife turn up dead in their own kitchen. Hmm.
I read about that.
a shame.
look, maybe we didn't see eye to eye on payment schedule, but Joel and I were good.
he paid you back? 200 grand.
Where'd he get the money?
Hey, as long ait's green, I don't ask any questions.
but I'll tell you this...
the whole thing almost made me believe in true love again.
Yeah, how is that? The wife...
she came in and hand-delivered it herself.
to Kunis? Why would she do that?
probably didn't trust him not to gamble it away.
but 200 grand... where'd she get that kind of money?
she hasn't practiced in eight months.
they can't even afford tvs. She's a doctor.
she could be dealing drugs or selling scrips.
so maybe Ann was the target?
and now Max is because channel six news leaked the story.
I put them all in a hotel. Where are we on the uncle?
well, he's got a dwi from freshman year at Stony Brook, and he's he's got a busload of parking tickets. That's it.
I don't like him for this, Al.
I mean, who hires a hit man to shoot up his own place?
what about that guy? He's still a John Doe.
van was stolen.
we got a trace out on the weapon.
Hey, Nina.
just spoke to the aunt's former employer.
Newsomes did file a harassment suit two years ago, and we got the gun back from the family friend.-Anything?
preliminary results from ballistics are negative.
sorry. I'll let you know when the M. E. has a final.
Thanks.
looks like uncle Erik's story pans out.
this lady came up with $200, 000.
let's find out where she got it.
you sit down with the trauma guys yet?
uh, later today.
it's not like I haven't been here before.
you need anything, let me know.
actually, I'm down to one these days.
Oh. Progress.
if you want, Johnson's down a guy on that floater they picked up under the Whitestone.
I just started, you're trying to get rid of me already?
just want to make sure you're okay.
anything new?
no.
it's the same.
I remember being with Rachel's body,
I hear a noise, I turn, I, uh...
see a man standing over me, can't see his face.
I'm stuck.
you'll get unstuck.
that's why you're here.
Yeah.
thank you, uh, for this.
okay, you guys may dress better here, but the coffee is just as bad as Syracuse.
so I got the final report.
uncle's gun is not the murder weapon, but while I was down there, M. E. wanted me to see something else.
that's the body of our hit man. Take a look.
nephrectomy scar.
translation? Guy sold his kidney.
uh, how do we know it wasn't just kidney disease?
Yeah, I asked the same question, but apparently, that would show up in both kidneys.
but this guy... Other one's clean as a whistle.-Anesthesiology.
I went drugs, but of course, organ harvesting.
Yeah, M. E. says that people pay upwards of 400 grand cash for one kidney.
red market. Lot of money at stake.
lot of desperate people. The whole van thing... sloppy.
guy wasn't a pro. All right, so who hired him?
someone who knew him from that world.
knew he needed money.
Oh... that's it. Gym bam.
they have these photographs of birthday parties on the wall, right?
one of the... one of the birthday dads, he had this exact same scar.
call over there. See if they can I. D. him.
we were going to lose everything, you know?
our apartment, everything.
did you know Dr. Seiferth? No, I don't think so.
Oh, Dr. Ann.
Yes, of course. She's an angel.
Daniel's birthday party...
her and Mr. Joel gave it to him after my surgery.
it was a beautiful party.
look, I'm okay.
it's like it never happened.
Mr. Banico, you... you're not in trouble, okay?
I just want you to give us some information.
when did you have your surgery?
police.
everyone stay down and be quiet.
office, paperwork. Got it.
stay back. See your hands.
get those paramedics in here.
I want my lawyer.
Yeah, you're going to need one. Check it out.
no patient files, but I found a phone bill, and every other call is to St. Mike's hospital.
the clinic was in Rego Park.
that's the medical staff we I. D.'d from the bust.
they were calling this hospital.
I'm sorry. I don't recognize any of these names.
the only thing I can think of is that we recently merged with All Saints.
it's an inner-city hospital.
and we took on a number of their physicians.
you met Dr. Raker.
Yeah, uh, the one who replaced Ann.
Yeah. He's great, but, uh, some of the departments have had problems
you think we could get a list of those doctors?
and anyone whose expertise might lend itself to organ harvesting.
Yeah, of course.
let's have my secretary get you that list.
I'm home. Liza?
what's going on in here?
what's going on?
I'm home!
I'm home.
beautiful plane, Dr. Mccardle.
it's my one extravagance. I keep her out at Teterboro.
Yeah, you know, when I was a kid, we used to have a family friend take us up for rides.
you ever take Max up? Yeah, I did, actually.
we all went up to the Cape and back.He loved it.
Oh, yeah, sure. A little boy.
big boys, too. I'm heading out tomorrow. But you're gonna miss the memorial.
Yeah, I know.
it's been crazy with the merger.
I promised my wife that I'd take her to Virginia beach.
that's a shame.
you and Ann were so close.
we talk to the staff and patients from the clinic takedown; none of them can I. D. Mccardle.
he probably never stepped foot in the place.
okay, so we get a warrant, we toss his condo, his office.
something will shake out.
you know, judge, search warrant, evidence.
you guys do that here, don't you?
judge, probable cause, search warrant.
and unfortunately, we can't bring what's in your head to a judge.
how about motive?
okay, uh, once she paid off her husband's debts, she wanted out.
that would be in line with what Banico said.
apparently, his friend's surgery was canceled last month 'cause there was no anesthesiologist.
so Mccardle killed her 'cause he needed her?-Maybe he didn't plan on killing her.
head of anesthesiology makes house calls with a Beretta?
no, but the head of an organ smuggling network does.
okay, so, what, he goes over there to tell her she needs to keep doing it?
right, and she says no, she wants out.
she threatens to, I don't know, go public.
husband walks in, hears what's been going on, uh, Mccardle panics, shoots him.
got to shoot the wife.
and he knows about the gambling, so he gives them each a shot in the forehead, makes it look like a hit.
fact is, even if he's involved in all this, we still can't tie him to the murders.
Max can.
you should get in there.-Me?
wow, I thought I was the unstable one who wasn't allowed to be around children.
our suspect's on his way to Virginia.
now, we need that boy's testimony.
I'll talk to Elaine. - No, no, no, no.
I'll talk to her.
my fault, my job, okay?
how's it going in there?
well, as you can see, it's gonna take some time.
which, I understand, we don't have.
al says you have a suspect.
Yeah.
how sure are you?- Very.
but we need Max to I. D. him.
look, Elaine, I should apologize...
no, I should.
when Max had his episode,
I assumed that you'd said something.
that was inaccurate and unfair.
Carrie, he's in a very, very delicate place.
I know. I've been there.
I'm in the room with you?
Absolutely.
Hey, Max.
do you know what I always hated?
there were no good superheroes for girls.
you know?
I mean, can you think of any, at all?
even one?
mystique. -Super villain.
doesn't count.
wonder Woman? Wonder Woman.
okay, I'll give you that one.But she's kind of boring, no?
I mean, I always thought she was kind of boring.
my sister and I, we used to make up our own superheroes.
it was pretty cool.
like, I could, uh, I could run super fast or I could see with super vision, or I could hear with super hearing.
and...
I always got the bad guy.
yeah? - Yeah.
well, there was this one time when I didn't, and, uh, that-that was pretty awful.
what happened?
I don't know.
it's like, uh...
all my superpowers, they just... went away, and I was really scared.
did someone die?
Yeah.
who?
my big sister.
I loved her.
and I cried all the time.
you did?
I want my mom and dad.
I don't want them to be dead.
I know.
did your powers ever come back?
Yeah, they did.
did you get the bad guys?
most of the time.
today, I need your help.
you okay, Max?
you just take your time.
that's him.
which number? Number three.
good job.
Hey, I, uh... I'm sorry.
Oh, you were, you were just doing your job.
he's so young.
maybe he'll forget.
I hope so.
and just because I'm not here as much, it does not mean I've forgotten you.
I'm still gonna come and visit you all the time.
Yes.
that would be nice.
okay.
you know I love you very much?
all right.
I love you, too.
just for a second.
here. Okay.-See, I told you it would fit.
so, can I keep it?
Yeah.
now let's go save the world!
I'm Carrie Wells.
only a few people in the world have the ability to remember everything.
I'm one of them.
pick any day of my life, and I can tell you what I've saw or heard.
faces, conversations, clues.
which cames in handy when you're a cop.
if I miss something first time, it's ok.
I can go back and look again. My life is unforgettable.
now, my idea was Texas barbecue, but Steve would have none of it.
right, Mom. "Cioffi's finger- licking ribs.
not sure it has the right ring to it. Stevie, place looks great, congratulations.
five years... that's longer than any of my marriages.
appreciate that.
so you are from Dallas. You really are, I didn't believe him.
he hates to admit it. Boy's ashamed of his own mother.
imagine how he feels about his dad.
look at you, The restaurateur.
What'd that magazine say? "The finest Tuscan cuisine in New York.
one of the finest.-Among the finest.
you're Memory Girl. In the flesh.
it's nice to finally meet you. Steve says I got to be careful what I say in front of you.
well, you should be careful about how you speak in front of me anyway.
she's a cop, but she's a comedian.
have a nice night. It's a pleasure.
I need a drink.
excuse me, may I have a whiskey? Thank you.
I like him. I mean, I'm scared of him, but I like him.
he likes you, too.
how do you know? - I had a girlfriend one time in college that Pop didn't like.
right, and her ankle ended up in Sheepshead Bay.
you can't tell me the same joke twice.
we're together three months, - I'm already running out of material. - It's awful.
Stevie, how's everything going? Everything's great, Tommy.
let me top you off. Keep that Crostini coming.
you got it. listen, can I ask her? Let me ask her, come on, I'm gonna ask her...
here it comes, ready? - Let him ask me.
february 10, 1991.
what happened on that day? February 10, 1991.
it was a Sunday.- ... NBA All-Stars played in Charlotte.
east won by two points.
I went on the worst date of my life - with Danny Kerr. - There you go.
I was confirmed on that day. Gotcha.
listen, you guys have a good time. Nice work, Tommy.
you are a good man, taking care of him the way you do.
it's hard enough getting a job if you didn't just get out of prison.
besides, he's my cousin.
you have so many cousins, even I can't keep track.
well, he's not my real cousin. We grew up together.
his dad had an accident when he was nine, and my family raised him.
there he is. Congratulations, buddy, congratulations. Yeah.
Carrie, this is Eddie Dal Bello, my linen guy. Eddie, hi.
nice to meet you. We prefer entertainment clothier, but linen guy will do for tonight...
and speaking of tonight, I got a special gift for you guys, a present, come on.
I'm getting whacked, aren't I? Yeah, this is it.
it's GOING TO HAPPEN.
come on, come on.
Barolo, Borzelleri... impressive.
special occasions only, okay? Take care of this.
all right. Got to go. Wait, you're not sticking around?
Yeah, I got something, but this, this is, this is really great, you know, con-congratulations.
all right? And I-I'll see you during the week.
and you... it was really great meeting you.
he's a great guy... you, you take care of him. OK?
I will. - Take care, guys.
all right, so how are they doing?
anybody slip up? You gonna have to make any arrests?
well, your uncle Vincent is stealing his pay-per-view.
I'll call the cable police.
look how far we've come since you first held me hostage in here.
what? - Yeah.
you weren't a hostage. Yes, I was.
the door was locked on the outside, and I was stuck in here on the inside.
you make that sound so dirty. It is dirty.
how about we just stay down here all night? And make mad, passionate love?
yeah
until your mommy comes looking for you.
fine, then we'll stop.
good night!
that, that was huge. That was a great party, Stevie.
great party... it was.
yeah? Hello. Yeah, this is Tommy.
Yeah, I'm totally free. Yeah, hold on a second.
Stevie, you got a pen? Yeah... hey, remember, whoever she is, she's got feelings.
when did you get so sensitive?
I'm glad you came.
you ARE? YEAH
here's your pen back, buddy. All right, take care, buddy.
behave yourselves. - Never.
right, so you remember every kiss? The memory games.
Yes, every kiss, ever. What?
morning. Vic's in the bathroom???
water was leaking into the apartment downstairs. My God.
we got a name... Francine Palmer.
teaches ESL at Queens Community.
landlady thinks she has a boyfriend, but no name on him. Looks like she put up a fight.
good for you. No forced entry.
windows were locked. Whoever did this got in easy, maybe boyfriend easy.
the door downstairs is ridiculously heavy.
it keeps closing on 'em.
so this maybe boyfriend... his name on the lease?
Yeah, the name on the lease is, uh, a Homer Simpson.
Yeah, well, we're running it through the system. We're canvassing the neighborhood.
Congratulations. Carrie, this is Eddie Dal Bello, my linen guy.
what?
what's going on? I know this guy.
his name is Eddie Dal Bello. You know him?
yes... no... kind of.
I met him last night at a party at Steve Cioffi's restaurant.
he works with Steve.
Oh, boy.
Dal Bello looks clean, except for one disorderly conduct charge ten years back, and IRS has him working for Trinity Restaurant Supply here in Queens, and he and his wife live in Sunnyside.
his wife?
now there's a theory.
maybe Dal Bello's wife finds out he's having an affair, she takes the code and the key to the apartment.
all right, did you send a unit to her house?
not home... neighbor has her in Boston visiting her mother.
I called the mom's house, left a message.- Mrs. Dal Bello needs to get back ASAP.
I'm on it. Was this guy alone at the party last night?
as far as I can tell, yes. Who else was at the festivities?
you know, the usual... killers, thieves, racketeers. Easy.
look, it was Steve, it was his friends, family, regulars from the restaurant.
you met a guy last night who is now a person of interest in a murder investigation.
Yes, I know that, I'm not an idiot. I'm the one who gave you his name.
and I'm just asking you to find out more about Dal Bello.
you've gotten it into your head that this is mob-related, okay, and on some level you want it to be.
no, I want to find out who killed Francine Palmer. So do I.
and, by the way, if you didn't know Steve Cioffi and you heard Dal Bello was at this party, you'd be all over the mob angle.
look, you don't want to talk to your boyfriend, I get it.
I'll talk to him.
no, you're not talking to him. - I'll go right now.
you are not talking to him.
I'll GO. Thank you.
you can be a real bastard, you know that? I try.
thank you for identifying her. I can't believe it.
w- We were just teaching together yesterday.
she's got family in Virginia.
have you called them? We'll make sure that happens.
how could anyone do that? It doesn't make sense.
that's why we need your help. We just have a few questions.
did you know her boyfriend?
Eddie? Yeah.
Yeah, I met him once. She was crazy about him.
you don't think...
did Francine know that Eddie was married? Married?
no. She thought they were going to get engaged.
were you aware of any other things that weren't on the up-and-up in the relationship?
did he ever hit her, make threats? No, not, not that I know of.
she have trouble with any of the students or faculty? No.
but a couple days ago, a man knocked on the door of her class, and when she came back she was kind of teary.
did you get a look at him? It wasn't Eddie.
no? - No.
this maybe the guy? No, I don't think so.
he was older and balding. Balding.
well, thank you for your time.
just through here.
so you showing her a picture of Cioffi... you know something I don't?
just taking a shot, that's all.
am I the only one who thinks this guy might really be clean?
Yeah, you and our star reporter. Well, for her sake I hope he is clean.
Yeah, for her sake, if he's not, the sooner we find out, the better.
they found Dal Bello's 2010 GS 350 on Ditmars, two blocks from the crime scene.
get anything from it?
nothing that ties to the murder, but it probably means he was there last night.
after Cioffi's party.
Yeah, could be, but then why does he leave the car? Maybe he left with someone else.
all right, well, the car has GPS, so let me see what else Tanya can dig up.
nice surprise. Tell me you haven't eaten.
Alex is doing this risotto... No, n-no, listen, I, I wish I could... I can't.
I'm actually here about work.
that sounds romantic. - Yeah.
a girl was murdered last night.
we found a picture of Eddie Dal Bello in her apartment.
his car was parked two blocks away. They were having an affair.
I figured the guy played around.
he was always talking and stuff, but... nah, it doesn't make sense.
why is he going to hurt her? Well, I don't know, I was hoping maybe you could tell me.
from what we're getting, she didn't know he was married.
look, I don't know how a guy acts before he's going to kill his girlfriend, but I never got the sense he's a violent guy.
sometimes when the truth comes out, things can get ugly, right?
look, I have no idea if Eddie is a bad guy, mobbed up, whatever you want to call it.
Yeah, I hear things around town. Never heard anything about Eddie.
that's all there is. - All right.
well, I appreciate you telling me that.
well, I appreciate you not asking me what all your pals at work want you to.
I'm just doing my job.
well, you can tell them I don't get the newsletter anymore.
Tommy! Eddie tell you where he was headed after the party last night?
I don't know.
but, uh, to be honest, I don't really remember much about last night.
have yourself a little after party?
Yeah, I, it was good, you know, uh, I'll bring her around.
I think, I think you'd like her.
Hey, Jo.
Yeah. I'll head over there right now. Okay. Bye.
I got to go.
am I gonna see you tonight? I got to go, but I'll call you.
water in the lungs, definitely drowned in the tub.
but there's facial and tracheal bruising and other signs of strangulation.
Plus, some serious blunt-force trauma to the abdomen.
this poor thing was beaten pretty badly before she died.
any idea what the weapon was?
well... there's petechial bruising around the neck, which would indicate that she was choked with some sort of flexible ligature before she went under.
I'm thinking this is not a crime of passion.
no, no. This was a make-a-point killing.
Yeah. Question is, make-a-point to who?
well... Dal Bello, the boyfriend, maybe.
heard you were looking for him. Yeah.
heard you bumped into him the other night. What?
I hear things. It's my open countenance.
or your open ears.
look, if hanging out at Steve Cioffi's restaurant is a sign of guilt,
I should be doing some serious time right now.
I, I, uh...
I just have one question:
is there anything you don't know about?
Rugby... certain marsupials.
and by the way, guilt by association is not my favorite kind of guilt.
I don't know, maybe it's my profession, but I prefer guilt by fingerprint or DNA.
thank you. I appreciate the support.
if anything else comes up, you'll let me know?
well, there was something in the bath water I couldn't identify.
I'm just waiting for the lab results. Thanks.
lieutenant Burns? - Yeah.
Sharon Vega, Organized Crime. Good to meet you.
detective Costello.
pleased to meet you. - Yeah.
can I talk to you? Sure. About what?
Francine Palmer investigation.
in my office.
your person of interest, Eddie Dal Bello, we've been looking at him for sometime.
for what?
we believe he's affiliated with Ray Marzulla, who we've been targeting for years.
Marzulla's into drugs, guns, anything he can steal or sell basically.
he runs his profits through legit businesses, mostly restaurant supply companies.
like, where Dal Bello works, Trinity Restaurant Supply?
exactly. Or the restaurants he supplies to.
right now, we got a missing married guy and his dead girlfriend.
you got an angle, we're open to it.
problem with Marzulla is, you can't get anybody to turn on him.
if Dal Bello got himself into trouble, the DA's got something to offer him.
I'm not fond of letting killers walk. He's up the food chain, Burns.
I'll show you what we got.
got something for Roe.
yeah? - Yep.
does it have to do with Francine Palmer?
yeah... - Yeah?
it does. Well, he's... yeah. He's...
not here. - Not here.
I guess I could give this to you. I'm a cop.
of course you are. Yeah.
you're A COP. ALL RIGHT
I analyzed the GPS records from Eddie Dal Bello's car.
like everybody, he's got his patterns.
but about five weeks ago, he started going to a new place multiple times a day. Here.
I just sent it to you. Yeah.
and I just got it.
that was fast. - Yup.
thank you.
you know, you could just... wait for him.
I could. - You could.
I bet he'll be back soon.
so I got a possible address on Dal Bello and...
I'm sorry. Lieutenant Vega, OCID.
Carrie Wells. Detective.
am I missing something here?
turns out OCID's been looking at Dal Bello for some time.
great. Shall we check out that address?
sure. I'll fill you in on the way.
clear! Clear!
Yeah. What we got? Glassware, pots, pans, appliances.
you could outfit a really nice kitchen. Or a restaurant.
unless I'm wrong, these match the contents of a bunch of truck hijackings over the past month.
all of them fronts for Ray Marzulla's companies.
so maybe Dal Bello's stealing from his own boss?
well, whoever killed Francine might have been trying to get her to say where he was and then realizes Marzulla was after him and realizes he's got to get the hell out of Dodge.
Barolo, Borzelleri... impressive.
al... this is the exact same kind of wine
Eddie Dal Bello brought as a gift to Steve at his party.
I say we get Dal Bello.
maybe he'll talk to save his own skin.
little late for that.
this doesn't look good.
well, you can read lips, too? I can read Al.
well, she's right. He's making the "squinchy" face.
the what? You know, that thing when you ask him for a day off?
he's all...
may I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION?
as of this moment, Organized Crime is taking over the Palmer-Dal Bello murder investigation.
you gotta be kidding me.
we will be giving them our complete and full assistance.
detective Vega. Thank you, Lieutenant.
folks, OCID believes that
ray Marzulla had Eddie Dal Bello and Francine Palmer murdered to send a message that he shouldn't be messed with.
well, we're gonna mess with him.
Carrie, can I talk to you?
what's going on?
what?
you've had me under surveillance?
OCID's been looking at Steve Cioffi for the past six months.
imagine their surprise when a Queens detective turns up as his dinner date.
my personal life is none of their business, hers...
no, but his is, and you gotta admit, it looks a little fishy when Dal Bello ends up dead right after you talk to Cioffi!
Carrie... what do you really know about this guy?
cause I'm getting an education here, all right?
the restaurant he runs?
it was bought at a substantial discount from one of his father's closest advisors,
Sammy "The Boot" Paluzzo, with money, by the way, of dubious origin.
half his employees are convicted felons either just out of prison or on parole.
nothing illegal about hiring ex-convicts.
in fact, he helps get them back on track.
or he's running a halfway house for wise guys. I checked his record.
he's clean.
Carrie, he's clean... he's so clean, it makes my teeth ache.
princeton water polo?
look at it from their perspective, okay?
can you think of a better way for Stefano Cioffi to leverage his criminal enterprise into the 21st century than to hire his Ivy-educated son as a beard?
show me some evidence.
just one piece of evidence that ties him to anything...
Francine Palmer's murder, a murder... anything illegal... just one.
it doesn't matter. You're compromised. YOU'RE OFF THE CASE
Really?
okay.
well, at least they got my good side.
right?
yo, Jo.
what do you got on Dal Bello? Booties. Apron.
I'm doing an autopsy.
do you have any idea where your feet have been?
I never had to do this with Falcone.
you ever hear of Peter Gorelick?
spent nine years at Ossining for manslaughter, convicted by a hair sample connected to the victim, except the sample came from a detective who'd interviewed Gorelick at his home, and then went to an autopsy.
okay.
so... about Dal Bello? I thought you'd never ask.
single GSW, the stippling around the entrance shows he was shot at close range, execution style.
in the last eight hours? Rigor says no.
he's been dead at least a day.
which means it was before Carrie's lunch with Steve Cioffi. All right.
I don't follow.
lieutenant Vega in the OCID, she thought there was a connection, pulled Wells off the case.
never cared for Vega. She pops her gum.
I gotta go tell Al about this. You might want to tell Al about this.
the contents of Dal Bello's stomach.
you got your fettuccine in a rich cream sauce, some salmon and some capers.
interesting. Same contents as Francine Palmer's.
they had dinner together. Assolutamente.
except Dal Bello's hands were pristine.
no cuts, no bruises, no scratches.
so you're saying he was with her, but he didn't kill her.
makes sense why his car was nearby.
which means the killer probably took him to the storage place from the scene.
Jo... you're a genius.
don't I know it.
forget ABOUT IT, COME ON.
I been dodging people like Vega my whole life.
they couldn't get my dad, so they came after me.
okay, they have you under surveillance; they have us under surveillance.
they're probably taking our picture right now.
when I was a kid, I thought everybody was under surveillance.
it was a game, like Hide- And-Seek or Capture the Flag.
this isn't a game, okay? Vega, organized crime...
they think you are running the family business. I can't do anything about what people think.
you bought your restaurant from Sammy the Boot!
the Boot? Old Sammy? Come on. Guy wears a colostomy bag and man diapers.
he murdered three people with his bare hands, and those are just the ones we know about.
look, I don't know that Sammy.
guy I know paid his debt to society, - retired a long time ago. - Steve!
Where'd you get the money for the restaurant, Steve?
do we really need to go there? Yeah, we really need to go there.
I have an account in the Cayman's. Big deal.
it's practically empty now, because I put all the money in the restaurant.
wall Street guys do it, which is where, by the way, I got the idea.
this isn't a joke, okay?
you're using your family's connections, you're using their money...
you want to know where that money came from? Yes, I do!
my mother's uncle dug an oil well.
I can't help who I am, Carrie, or who my family and friends are.
I'm not going to deny 'em. But I'm not part of 'em.
I thought we been through this.
sorry. You have every right to ask.
Vega is going to use Dal Bello's murder to come after you.
you get it? Of course she is.
she thinks she's got her smoking gun. Wants to prove I'm the next Al Capone.
there's nothing you can do. There's something I can do.
I can make sure the investigation follows the evidence, and not her fantasies.
and where's the evidence going? Man.
this is... All right.
Eddie Dal Bello was stealing from Ray Marzulla.
got himself and his girlfriend killed.
now, I need your help.
where I can find Marzulla?
Carrie, that's not a guy who wants to be found.
you got any ideas?
all right, there it is.
how'd you find this place? A little bird told me.
I appreciate you coming along, by the way.
Yeah. What's Al gonna do, pitch a fit? Toss me off the case, too?
it's not just that. I know you had your doubts. I still do...
but the way I see it, screw Vega and the OCID.
you need anything, I'm there.
things go south in there, you give me a holler, all right?
thank you.
a shot of Cutty.
what's this?
water. Figured a cop shouldn't be drinking on the job.
you're good.
Where's Ray Marzulla? Never heard of him.
Really? That's interesting, 'cause word is, he owns this place.
and I need to talk to him about a murder.
Yeah, sorry. I can't help you.
Steve, you got a pen? Yeah, but remember, whoever she is, she got feelings.
Yes. How sensitive of you.
you're the regular guy around here?
me? Lady, I'm just filling in.
yeah? So, who would have been working about two days ago?
funny, I can't remember. Well, thanks for your help.
and the water.
anything? A number.
too short to be a phone number.
how about an address? No. No street name.
maybe it spells something.
maybe IT SPELLS SOMETHING...
whoever did this got in easy.
maybe boyfriend easy.
what? What is it?
you got that look. - What look?
well, the "I remember everything" look. No.
no. It's nothing.
let's just, uh, keep an eye on this place, okay?
you got it.
honey.
God, you are beautiful. I ever tell you that?
all the time, actually. Romeo and Juliet.
so, there's hope,
Marco told me you were here.
what's going on? Can I talk to you for a sec?
Yeah. Something happen? Where's Tommy?
my Tommy? I don't know. In the kitchen probably. No, he's not. I already checked.
okay. Listen, the night of your party...
Tommy... he wrote a number on his hand.
Yeah. Yeah, the girl's number. I remember. It wasn't a girl's number.
it was the pass code to the front door of Francine Palmer's apartment.
he was on the phone with Marzulla or one of his guys.
Steve, look, Tommy... he's... I know he's your friend.
he's more than my friend.
he's my brother, he's like family.
remember? I'm sure you do.
so you're not going to tell me that suddenly, he became a killer.
I wanted you to hear it from me. Well, forgive me if I don't take your word for it.
I know you're trying to do the right thing here, but I'm telling you, you're wrong.
and I'm telling you, you need to stay away from him.
from Tommy? Never gonna happen.
Really? I'm gonna have to tell my guys about this. It's just the way it breaks, right?
you're a cop. What are you gonna do? Listen to me.
if you tip him off, you become an accessory. So do I.
I put myself on the line for you.
guess you shouldn't have told me, then.
roe, hold up.
where you been? Sorry. I, uh, had a thing.
did you try to call my cell, 'cause I didn't get...
any chance this thing involved Carrie? No. No.
how's she doing? I haven't seen her.
but, uh, if I had, I'd say, she was on to something.
from our search of Dal Bello's.
he planned every detail of the hijackings.
he had the truck" delivery schedules, a file on the drivers, where the guys live, where their kids go to school.
a minor player looking to make it in the majors with some outside help at the expense of Marzulla's profits.
certainly reason for him to end up dead. Francine probably wasn't a target.
she just had bad taste in boyfriends. Yeah, Marzulla didn't do this himself.
let's start looking into his associates. We can use the killer to take down the whole organization.
and we're Homicide. We want to find out who killed an innocent woman.
after that, you can do what you want.
listen up.
anyone heard from Carrie?
no. - How about Vega?
she left about 20 minutes ago.
do me a favor. See if you can find her, will you?
sure.
Tanya, how long would it take you to get a location on her cell phone?
it depends. You talking GPS-enabled? - No.
well, I got to bounce it off towers, but in the metro area,
I could get you in pretty close. I'd say about 15 minutes?
that the number? - Yes.
cool.
it looks an awful lot like detective Wells'...
right.
not a problem. Let me know - if you get something. - Yup.
I'm on it.
I GOT IT. The phone's just north of the Triborough Bridge on the Queens side.
she's been... That phone has been there for a while.
no luck yet on Vega. No answer at OCID. Looks like her whole unit's in the field.
keep TRYING
and you got a chance for a new start now.
man, another $7. 25 an hour job? I mean, come on, bro.
what do you even know about that? You're Steve Cioffi. You're Mr. Golden Boy. You got everything. Come on, man.
still Hunter's Point? All right, thanks, Tanya.
burns here. Yeah.
so, we've been sitting on your pal Steve Cioffi pretty close, and it looks like he's been making a bunch of calls to a cousin of his named
Tommy Rugolo, who's an ex-con, been working at the restaurant.
Cioffi and he set up a meeting in the middle of nowhere.
and I thought you might want to be there in case it turns out to be our guy.
where are they meeting? Up at Hunter's Point near the pool.
all right.
man, I'm telling... No. Marzulla was offering me real money, he's offering me - a real job. - Tell me what you...
Steve? What are you doing here?
listen... - You brought the cops!?
I'm here to help...
have you been following me? -NO
how could you do this to me?! We don't have a lot of time. I want you to listen to me, Tommy.
I want you to come into the station with me, Tommy.
I want you to tell your side of what happened to Francine Palmer.
look, I mean, look, I was there, all right, but I didn't... I didn't even touch her.
I believe you. - God, Stevie, what did you do?!
I believe you. Come in with me.
let me get you a deal before Marzulla makes sure you can't.
you got to trust her. Marzulla's bad news. Take the deal.
you set me up? You set me up?!
Carrie, what the hell is this?!
Tommy! No!
gun! - No!
No...!
what part of "you're off the case" did you not understand?
listen to me.
I followed Steve because I thought there was a good chance he could get Tommy to come in and talk to you guys.
and it would've worked if you and Vega hadn't just shown up.
I don't need you to protect me from Steve Cioffi.
okay? I don't. - It's Vega
I was trying to protect you from.
she's convinced you're dirty, and I was afraid you'd both end up dead, okay?
now, look, we found a shirt with Francine's blood on it in Tommy Rugolo's apartment.
Tommy had no history of violence.
he said he was at Francine's apartment, but he told me he didn't kill her, and I believe him.
fine. Let's just say, for the sake of argument, okay, that Tommy was telling the truth.
that means whoever did this is still out there.
as far as Vega's concerned, the case is closed.
it's not closed!
she grilled Cioffi downstairs... his lawyer showed up, pointed out there's nothing to charge him with.
just put me back on the case, put me back on the case, and I will find whoever did this, I promise you.
yes?
Yes.
you talk to Steve? No.
and after what happened today, I, uh...
I think it's really unlikely we will ever talk again.
first good news I've heard all day.
Hi. You doing okay? I heard it was a little hairy out there.
Yeah. Well, I'm doing better than him, right?
well, you've got your guy, right? OCID makes Tommy for both the shootings.
Tommy told me he didn't kill anyone, and I believe him.
the thing is, I got to prove it.
I just want to know what you think. Okay, the facts I have:
Eddie Dal Bello was shot at close range with a big old. 44, which may have left residue on the shooter's hand.
well, did Tommy have residue on his hands? No, but that doesn't prove anything.
okay. What about Francine?
Francine was beaten about the...
face, shoulders, abdomen by a right-handed person with very large hands.
kind of puny.
also, starring on the carpal bone indicates ???
he broke his wrist as a child.
so it's highly unlikely he could have done that kind of damage.
all right, that's good.
anything else? - Not much.
no definitive prints off the body, no DNA to test.
I thought I got something out of the bathwater, but the lab tests came back.
ethyl acetate.
also found in the abrasions on Francine's neck.
that's a pesticide, right? -Mm and a solvent and an adhesive.
it's found in superglue.
it also activates or hardens confectionary, perfume, paint.
this guy could be an entomologist who works at a candy factory.
what about someone who makes models? Like toy planes.
Yeah, possibly in the paint. Definitely in the glue.
this guy a model maker? - Him? No.
but I know someone who is.
thank you. - Good!
happy!
hello again.
how you doing? You still working on this thing?
careful with that. Looks good!
albatross D-3, right? The "V-strutter" is what they used to call it.
quite a dominant little fighter, except for the occasional... wing failure.
kind of like that.
you ARE NOT THE SMARTEST GUY, ARE YOU?
I mean, you leave all of the names and numbers of the people you've hurt right up there on that wall for a cop like me to see.
2640 Ambrose Lane. I did a little research.
Leo Riccard's hand smashed with a mallet.
610 East 25th, apartment 2A,
Darren O'Malley beaten beyond all recognition.
I could go on and on.
when Ray Marzulla wants to send a message, you're the guy who does it.
I never heard of the guy.
no? Why'd you kill Francine Palmer, hmm? Was it 'cause she fought back?
don't know anything about that.
the glue from your little hobby, it was found in the water, in her lungs, it was found in the scratches on her neck.
you understand? We got you.
hands behind your back! Come on. Come on.
you want to fight with a woman, you got to fight with a woman.
thanks you calling. Sorry, been a little busy.
I walked past the restaurant a couple times. It was closed.
Yeah, we're gonna have a wake for Tommy. Real old school.
listen, I'm sorry about Tommy.
I'm sorry about all of it. I-I... Come on.
just doing what you got to do.
no. No, that-that wasn't... me.
they've been watching your family for months.
I saw your guy there... Al Burns.
he wasn't there for you. He was there for me.
I guess I could see that.
listen, I want you to know Tommy was telling the truth.
he didn't kill Francine, he didn't kill Eddie.
Marzulla? Yeah, one of his guys.
and we're gonna get him. Thank you.
sure. Thanks for saving my life.
Yeah. Well, you know, it's my specialty.
I gotta go.
it's family.
right, of course.
a divinity that shapes our ends.
Romeo and Juliet. That's, uh...
well, at least we rewrote the ending, right?
they, uh, died, and we lived.
you won't forget the good parts, will ya?
me? Forget?
all right, you're going to need to add more pumice to the dryer to scuff these up.
are you listening to me? Otherwise, they will not look real.
any 7-Eleven clerk will know these are phony. -Maybe I should test the magnetic ink levels.
Yeah, maybe you should make yourself useful. They have...
caught this guy trying to crash the party. What should we do with him?
one day earlier
you just picked that card. Could you be more dumb?
the blueberry's over here.
Ow! - Bad Carrie.
Hey. I have a perfect memory.
why not use it to help a little girl? Her brother is picking on her.
Joan of Arc, Marie Curie, Florence Nightingale...
they were all tormented younger sisters and they all turned out fine.
fine? - Mm-hmm.
burned at the stake, radium poisoning, influenza...
not so fine. -Are you ovulating?
what? - Well, I'm just asking because sometimes an increased estrogen surge can create a heightened maternal impulse.
okay. I'm not ovulating and I'm not... maternal.
okay.
bet Al wants kids. -Okay, what are you talking about?
what, what?
I'm just trying to figure out why you and Al are not together.
why are we having this bizarre conversation?
Yeah, okay...
what are you... what are you doing? -That's my manure shovel.
you know, every time you and Al are in the same room together, I need a cold shower.
speak of the devil.
Hi, Al. Okay. I'm on my way.
Bye. Something's going on with Jay.
nice.
I'm not ovulating. - Hmph.
sorry for dragging you into this.
my sister's ex-husband is missing. - Since when?
last night. Evan didn't show for his custody visitation.
you're an uncle?
they share custody of a dog. A Pomeranian.
I'm sorry. Come again?
look, I know it sounds ridiculous, but Natalie's a CPA, super levelheaded.
I've never seen her freak like this.
I just want her to know that we're all there for her.
I pinged, uh, Evan's cell phone to the Carlton Hotel.
I'm sure it's nothing. -I'll go find Natalie.
you brought me all the way down here to use my overtaxed superpowers because of a dog?
man. - Whatever.
you owe me.
here's a recent picture of Evan. Thank you so much for helping.
I know this seems insane, but I'm positive there's something wrong.
he has never missed a custody visitation.
if it's important to you and your brother, it's important to us.
look, Nat, you divorced Evan for a reason.
I mean, the guy's a pretty flaky guy.
he's a musician, so, yes, but two things he never screws up on:
arriving on time for his gigs, and visiting Derek Jeter.
Derek... Jeter? -Jeter's the Pomeranian.
of course he is.
Evan's in room 2424. -Okay, let's go.
the divorce was really rough on Evan, - so he's kind of undergone a personal makeover recently. - I have your bags here, sir.
uh, sir? -He took a day job...
room 14. ......driving a truck.
I think he's... working really hard to win me back.
understandable. Getting his act together.
can't play in a band forever.
this is gonna get awkward when we barge in on Evan with another woman.
or another Pomeranian.
Jay, keep her out of here.
No!
this is Lieutenant Burns.
I need CSU on site here at the Carlton Hotel.
we have a gunshot victim, DOA.
No!
single gunshot wound in the back. The body's still warm.
CSU thinks this happened in the last hour or so. And no wallet, no keys.
are you sniffing?
this lingerie has not been worn, which is strange.
not as strange as you sniffing panties. -What's it doing here?
all of this feels staged.
Evan registered for the room this morning. Paid for it with his credit card.
well, guy checks into a hotel at that time for one reason.
anyone see him with a woman? -No, but this is a busy hotel.
it's a perfect place for a nooner.
so maybe a prostitute robs Evan, something goes sideways, she shoots him, flees the scene.
simple robbery homicide. -Or not so simple.
Evan and I were divorced, so he was free to do whatever he wanted to, but him being here makes no sense.
I know this is hard, but can you think of any other reason why he would be registered in this room this morning?
I know what this looks like.
but... Evan was a musician, he liked girls, girls liked him back.
he didn't need to pay anyone. He barely had any money.
the truck driving job only covered his rent and food.
Evan was wearing a, uh, lanyard with an ID in it in the photo that you showed me.
Yeah, he always wore it. - Always?
Yeah. I know this is gonna sound really weird, but... I gave him the lanyard to wear around his neck so he wouldn't flake out and forget his work ID.
and he told me he'd wear it everywhere, just to prove to me how responsible he was, so I would take him back.
Hey.
Oh, hi. How's Jay doing? -Okay, given the circumstances.
how, uh, how's your leg holding up? -So far so good.
I never thought the plow pose would injure me. -I never thought of you as a "namaste" kind of girl.
Andre and I ended up in the bedroom, and everyone knows the plow pose enhances...
all right, you know what?
I don't need that... visual.
okay...
all right.
now, the ballistics guys are doing more tests, but the bullet is, to say the least, unusual.
it's a caliber unique to an Indonesian assault pistol.
there was a take-out bag with an Indonesian flag on it right outside of Evan's hotel room.
there's got to be a connection. -The... Indonesian flag?
that memory... it's in there? -Mrs. Furst's third-grade classroom.
right above Emily Hubley's desk. Flags of the world poster.
okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay.
half orange, half yellow, white dragon?
bhutan.
Oh, why do I even try? - Sorry.
okay.
here's the gun, a Pindad PS-01.
that is an armor-piercing bullet.
I mean, even I couldn't get my hands on one of those if I wanted to. - Well, ballistics guys say that there's not a gun store within a thousand miles that would carry anything for this.
why does a prostitute need heavy ammo? -She wouldn't.
the Carlton
Jay, no one would blame you if you needed some time.
Evan's hotel room was opened at 6: 45 this morning.
nobody else entered with a key until you and Carrie.
what about security cameras? -Nothing on any of the floors.
still waiting on the security tapes from the lobby, but there's a back entrance.
let me guess: no camera there? -You got it.
and nobody in the hotel puts Evan with a woman.
Carrie thinks there might be a connection to a Indonesian restaurant.
run Evan's credit cards, see if you can link him to one.
already in the works, boss. Got the subpoena.
what's up?
I'm kicking the Evan Rusk investigation to the 17th squad.
no, you're not. -Jay's one of us, Eliot.
Yes, and I'll make sure the case is at the top of the 17th's priority list, but Evan ended up in a hotel room with a prostitute and was murdered.
that's for the homicide division... -Okay, Eliot. U... use your imagination here.
all right? E... Evan's keys, his lanyard, his trucking ID...
all stolen.
his truck might be missing, and hijacking across state lines is a major crime.
the issue with a truck hijacking is that you need an actual hijacking.
so where is this truck?
W... - I have it, Eliot.
you are a long way from Washington, Francis.
well, you know, sometimes my work brings me to America's second most important city.
special Agent Frank Simms, United States Secret Service.
Oh. Yeah. Lieutenant Al Burns, Detective Carrie Wells.
I'm sure they're also curious as to what you're doing here.
Oh, I'm taking over Evan Rusk's murder investigation.
on what grounds? - Secret Service?
it's a local crime.
well, Rusk's murder is part of an ongoing counterfeiting investigation.
you see? Major crime.
thank you, Francis. -Frank is fine; you can call me Frank.
okay.
no, you know, this isn't over.
I'm gonna find out who authorized this big-footing of my case.
if you have any questions, Eliot, you can call my boss. -Oh, he's gonna play the POTUS card.
the president of the United States of America. You want his cell number?
I got it. - No.
okay, well,
Evan Rusk transported a pallet of currency-grade paper used exclusively to produce the new $100 bill.
there's not only one but three "holy grails" of counterfeiting the new hundred.
the first one...
currency-grade paper with an embedded holographic strip.
the second is magnetic ink that registers on the Federal Reserve Bank counting machine.
and the third is valid serial numbers from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.
I read your Homeland Security memo entitled, "The New Hundred Anticounterfeiting Measures.
well, it's nice to know someone doesn't only read our memos, but remembers them.
I'm impressed. -Don't be; it's genetic.
she was born with a freaky memory.
well, there's only one way into the cargo area of the truck without using explosives.
the driver's swipe ID. Evan's missing lanyard.
show-off. -Right again.
and no one has ever stolen even one sheet of U. S. currency paper.
until today. -Here's another truck hijacking.
same M. O. as Evan's murder. Hotel killing.
you know, based on these photos, and the fact that you're here with your panties in a twist,
I'd say the magnetic ink is also missing, am I right? -Someone's acquiring your holy grails.
what about the valid serial numbers? -That, I'm afraid, is on a need-to-know basis.
Oh, he did not just... -Oh, yes, he did.
the Bureau of Engraving and Printing has confirmed no breach of serial numbers.
I have now fulfilled the Homeland Security mandate for interdepartmental cooperation.
well, I guess you don't want to hear about our Indonesian connection?
you found some link to Indonesia? I mean, I could talk to you about the Indonesian link, but you have to include Major Crimes in your investigation.
that way we can all accomplish what we want here.
can I have my hundred first?
you, my friend, are having a very difficult time keeping track of U. S. currency today.
you'll never see your money again.
Yeah.
I followed up on Carrie's Indonesian lead. -Get a hit?
actually, Jay found that Evan had a credit card charge from two weeks ago at Medan, an Indonesian restaurant on the Lower East Side.
nice job. I'll let the special agent know.
you know, Simms had quite the reputation when I was back at the Bureau.
Yeah, you knew him? - Of him.
his scouting report said he was the biggest player in D. C. since the Clinton administration.
what's your point, Murray? I'm just saying, where there's smoke...
good intel. Appreciate the heads up.
I see you made yourself comfortable.
the crew I'm after... Crew we're after.
Jenny Shaw, graphic designer, likely the papermaker.
Kristen Green, the engraver. Olivia Waring, the electroplater.
and finally, Sophie Dietrich, the intaglio printer. All art school grads.
all went off the grid about four months ago.
Really? This is your team of counterfeiters?
they don't look like killers. -Well, your pretty partner doesn't look like a cop.
Hey, what's her deal, by the way? Let's get back to the case.
what is the connection between these hot girls?
they met on the darknet. We think their hotness isn't a coincidence.
we believe they're seducing men like Evan in order to gain access to the materials needed to manufacture counterfeit bills.
that's why, uh, we've given the operation the code name "Mata Hari.
hmm. Hold on.
why would four women with no previous criminal records all decide to start forging the most difficult U. S. currency to counterfeit?
that stolen pallet of currency-grade paper is worth $72 million.
is that enough "why," Lieutenant?
my guess is, one of these girls was with Evan at that Indonesian restaurant.
think it's worth a look.
medan, Indonesian
okay, how did you know that security camera was hidden behind a Balinese puppet?
well, it seemed like the best angle, and that's where I would've put it.
you're something.
you've known me for six hours and 42 minutes, and you're just now figuring that out?
okay, so I showed you my Indonesian connection.
now it's your turn to show me yours, and don't tell me it's on a need-to-know basis, or I'll hit you with my rice balls.
all right.
we believe a major international player in the fraudulent currency market is making his way to the United States. An Indonesian trader.
so there's a ticking clock on this whole operation, and your Charlie's Angels counterfeiting crew, they've only got a little bit of time to get those valid serial numbers.
which plays into my hand.
and by "my hand," you mean "our hands," right?
okay.
I've been scanning through the restaurant's security footage for two hours; no sign of Evan.
Yeah, you two took your sweet time. -I got you some balls. Coconut rice.
give them to your new partner, Simms. He could use a pair.
you're just jealous because he's friends with the president of the United States.
Hey. - You're wearing a new tie.
well, yes, I have a fresh one.
doesn't everyone? - Have some balls.
Hey, guys, it's Evan. -Well, we can't see her face.
we can't ID her. -Poor guy's being worked.
this is getting us nowhere.
might be getting you nowhere, but I saw that tattoo in the hotel today.
Jay, zoom in on it. -You find this normal?
no, I find it exceptional.
visual Match:
tattoo is of an Indonesian radical group, The Red Door, responsible for a series of bombings and assassinations in their homeland.
real anti-Western types. -Did you see the woman's face?
no, I think, I think the door closed before...
the divorce was really rough on Evan, so he's kind of undergone a personal makeover recently.
he took a day job driving a truck. -I have your bags here, sir.
uh, sir? - Room 14.
I think it's more complicated
Yeah, I saw her face.
pulled these from Interpol, suspected Red Door members.
okay.
Jay, stop right there.
go back three. Go back, go back, go back.
there. I am willing to bet anything that we are looking at Evan's murderer.
that's Padma Jindal.
her file says that, uh, Padma's family was killed by pro-Western forces when she was a child.
now she's the spear end of the Red Door. -Report doesn't say anything about counterfeiting.
so what's an assassin from the Red Door doing in New York? -And what does she need counterfeit money for?
I got an idea. I'm taking it to the darknet.
anonymous [639]: Valid Anonymous [284]: I know a vendor Anonymous [639]: Set up a meet IRL? Anonymous [284]: Date/ Location
it's been four hours and nothing.
I could have 25 specialists in Washington trolling the darknet and trying to make contact with these people.
but you didn't have the Padma Jindal connection.
until now. -We've made contact.
I posed as a seller of valid serial numbers.
teased them I had a contact over at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.
the counterfeiters are pushing a meet tomorrow morning.
this totally tracks with your intel about the Indonesian money buyer.
you think your 25 specialists could've scored a meeting this quickly?
even a blind pig finds a truffle. -Who you calling a blind pig?
you know what, I'm gonna get a cup of coffee. - Do you have an operations plan?
well, procedure is, we send someone in to meet the counterfeiters and give them a proof of concept... a valid serial number.
when the number comes up clean, we arrange for payment, a second meeting, and tail whoever comes to the meeting.
I don't think Padma or the other operatives would risk exposure.
they'll probably send an intermediary.
I can have an undercover operative up here from D. C. in 24 hours.
you already have an undercover operative: me.
no, too risky. - I can't believe I'm saying this, but Al's right.
this is a Secret Service op. This is what we do.
all right, you guys get one shot with these girls, okay?
if you scare them, they disappear, that's it.
you don't get your ink or your paper, and we don't help Jay find Evan's killer.
Carrie, with all due respect, you're a local cop.
I mean, you're a brilliant one, for sure, but there's no way you have time to learn enough about counterfeiting to go undercover.
try me.
the Liberty Bell inside the inkwell doesn't change from copper to green.
fake.
uh, there's some nice texture on Ben Franklin's shoulder; this one's real.
okay.
okay, this is just pathetic.
the backside has the front of Independence Hall, not the rear.
all right. - Fake.
this one's amateur stuff. What about this one?
watermarks are cold-pressed after inking. Fake.
did you take one of those online memory courses?
no. - Hmm.
I'm a walking online memory course. Honestly, I have HSAM.
it's Highly Superior... -Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory.
Yeah. - Wait a minute.
only five people in the world have that. -Six, and you really think I'm that special?
I think you think you're that special.
all right, try me. Give me a day, month, year.
january 5, 1998. -It was a Monday.
opening arguments at the Unabomber trial, massive ice storm in Canada, and Brock Steele awkwardly tried to pet my thigh throughout the entire screening of The Titanic, 194 minutes at the Syracuse Megaplex.
okay, how... how do I know you're not just making this up?
well, you can look it all up on the Internet.
except for the Brock Steele part, yeah, well. - Brock Steele thing?
you got some mind on you.
Yeah, sometimes it's a curse.
all right.
eight hours till the meet.
I think I'm ready. -I think you are.
all right, see you.
she just took my real hundreds.
all right, well, your guy said...
last time... my guy's name is Jay.
Jay... - Thank you.
... got the word from the Mata Hari crew.
Madison Plaza, 90 minutes. We're gonna meet Carrie there.
you can give them all the cute code names you want.
these women have killed three people that we know of.
and Padma's a wanted radical. You're concerned about solving a federal case.
I'm concerned about my partner's well-being. -She's not in danger.
the counterfeiting crew needs thousands of serial numbers to cover what... $72 million in bills?
Carrie's gonna give them one. They're gonna need her alive to get the rest.
we're gonna monitor her cell signal. Put a tracking device on her.
no tracking device. Carrie's dead if they find a GPS on her.
standard federal procedure. Nonnegotiable.
I don't care what your federal handbook says, okay? We do undercover work all the time.
I'm telling you, these people will try to sniff out a sting.
this is Carrie's life we're talking about.
well, that's exactly why Carrie needs to do this by the book.
my people are gonna handle surveillance at the plaza. -My people as well.
no, your people are gonna hang back at Major Crimes.
no, we're all working together on this one, Frankie.
Oh, geez... - Unless you want to call my boss?
mayor of New York.
think of him as the POTUS of the five boroughs.
I know you're busy
no, no, it's not a problem.
you're gonna get whoever did this, right?
look, my team? These guys, they're the best.
and now, Al and Carrie have got my back, which means they got your back, too.
I wish that made me feel better, but that doesn't bring Evan back.
no, it doesn't.
but it might be the starting point to help you get on with your life.
I just wish I hadn't been so stubborn. I'm such a control freak.
and I was always waiting for the perfect time.
perfect time for what? -To tell Evan that I changed my mind.
and that I wanted him to come back.
you know, Nat, Evan called me a couple weeks ago.
he told me that he was working really hard to become the man that you always wanted him to be.
the lanyard? -You know what he said?
he told me that, uh, that he had a lot of hope, and that hope made him happy.
sounds like Evan.
get who did this.
promise?
have I ever let you down? -No.
Thanks, Jay.
now, as a reminder... - "Reminder," really?
I know, I know! I'll give them one valid serial number, arrange payment, and set up a second meeting.
then make your way back to us. -Yeah.
got it. -Take this burner.
anything seems off, you call my cell.
Carrie has the one and only emergency number she needs... mine.
here you go.
all right. You'll be back with us soon.
thank you.
you'll do great. -See you in a bit.
good luck.
you guys on her?
she's moving, but her tracker's off-line. -This is what you do?
come on, guys, move it.
I got her phone.
get her in! Close it up.
she has to be in the step van they used to block the camera.
I will use every tool in my arsenal to find her.
you lost her. I'll find her.
well, it'd be a hell of a lot easier to find her if she was still wearing a tracker.
the only reason she's alive right now is because they didn't find it on her.
guys, we got something.
these four step vans all exited this location within three minutes of Carrie's abduction.
broadcast an alert for all vans matching that description.
have them stopped and searched until we find Carrie.
there's about a thousand vans that look - Get it over the air right now! - ... exactly like that in Manhattan.
God!
well, this isn't a very nice way to start a partnership, ladies.
it might affect my Yelp review. -Is she clean?
she's clean, no bugs.
didn't draw a tail after we grabbed her. -I hope you have a valid serial number for me.
if I don't call my associate, you won't get your serial numbers.
you know, I'm not sure I like the way you conduct business.
I'm not in the business of trusting anyone.
particularly someone I've never met.
serial number. -Untie me, and I'll give you one.
does anybody have a pen?
thank you.
can I use your hand?
I'll give them one valid U. S. serial number, arrange the payment, and set up a second meeting.
serial number database: KB34566438
cleared
you know, you really should have more faith.
I have faith you're gonna give me all the numbers now.
give me my money and I'll give you the serial numbers.
how about give me the numbers and you live?
your whole operation falls apart without me.
how about you wire the money, I give you the serial numbers?
we get it at the same time, and we both win.
I'll wire it.
but if my numbers don't show up at the same time, I'll kill you.
here's the wiring information.
I'm gonna need to call my associate. Can I borrow a phone?
send the numbers to this Web address.
hurry up.
it's Carrie! Jay, try to get a trace.
keep her on the line as long as you can.
call Trace
hey
Roy, are Carl and Darcy around, or can you talk?
uh, "Carl and Darcy.
no, it's just me.
what's up?
I need you to send those, uh, items we talked about.
now? But I thought we needed...
just do it for me, Roy, within an hour, and you'll be on your way to Barbados, first class.
it's gonna take some time.
come on, come on. -Carl and Darcy are gone, but my supervisor's still on the floor.
uh, it could take an hour. -Not a minute more, Roy, okay?
send the numbers to "emerald-five- four-five-dot-I-D.
damn it!
what? What? -Didn't have Carrie on long enough to triangulate the call.
see, I would supply her with the numbers, but...
they'd kill Carrie one second after they had them.
which means we have less than an hour to save her life.
"carl and Darcy," what's that about?
I don't know. It's some kind of code; she's leaving a trail of bread crumbs to find her.
the problem is, I don't have the memory she does.
Carl's an old partner of mine. Darcy's his wife.
all right. Come on. Come on. Come on.
Carrie met 'em once, when I dragged her to a barbecue in Bayonne.
right across the Hudson.
Bayonne's a pretty big area, Al.
uh, what about, uh, Barbados... does that mean anything?
she won a contest in a bar in Syracuse, maybe ten years ago.
two tickets.
wait, we got snowed in. We actually flew out of Newark.
hold on... flight path to Newark Airport cuts right over the docks of Bayonne.
okay, let's roll. We have 57 minutes to get to Jersey.
28 minutes left. I hope your associate comes through for you.
he always does. -Let me see the final proofs.
we have flawless proofs...
and soon we'll have their valid serial numbers.
but I'm afraid we're gonna have to renegotiate your cut.
I thought the Red Door was the defender of the oppressed, not the oppressor.
uh, the tattoo... on the back of your neck.
I saw it in a New York Times article, May 2010, "The Red Door Closest to the West.
you don't understand the struggle of my people.
you're right, I don't, but I do know that killing her won't help your cause.
she called me "Roy." What?
on the phone, she called me Roy. Why'd she call me Roy?
something about the two of you. Any Roys you guys have in common?
it's got to be personal. Come on, channel Carrie.
there's a fireman named Roy.
he lived in a converted garage in my building when we first started...
dating? Figures as much.
wait... garage.
we're looking for a corrugated aluminum garage door, the kind that rolls up.
it could be a warehouse or an old firehouse.
we're running out of time. Fan out!
look for a corrugated garage door and then see if you can spot the van.
Bennie, get rid of these four.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
I'm just saying... I wouldn't.
see, y... y... you got a problem here:
this money is garbage.
y... you need them to fix this, this is never gonna fly.
I... I can teach them.
that way you don't get pinched, it doesn't trace back to me, and then you can kill them, do whatever you want with them, but right now you need them.
these bills have to be aged, so where's the dryer?
do what she tells you!
let's get to work.
Jay... there's an orange garage door.
Roy was a crazy Syracuse fan; he painted his door orange.
I don't know what you're talking about, Al, who's Roy?
track my phone, Jay. -Okay, keep the line open and I'll find you.
wait for backup, Al. -No time.
no. Al, Al! Wait.
just keep tracking it.
Hey, open up!
all right, you're gonna need to add more pumice to the dryer if you want these to look real.
you got to scuff them up more.
right now any 7-Eleven clerk would know that they are phony.
maybe I should test the magnetic ink levels. Yeah, maybe you should make yourself useful.
they have......Caught this guy trying to crash the party.
what should we do with him?
kill him. - Wait.
he's my associate. Roy.
how'd he get here? -You think she showed up at the plaza alone?
you were supposed to be more careful.
you're no better than the people who murdered your family.
what do you know about my family? Everything I do is to honor them.
murdering innocent people doesn't honor anybody.
innocent? Look around!
Roy... the numbers.
Roy doesn't have them. I do.
then he's of no more use to me! -Wait!
list of valid serial number ranges
KB56450000 through KB56454999.
I just gave you 5, 000 valid serial numbers. Check them.
good.
do you have the rest of the numbers in that head of yours?
lower your weapons and I'll give you 3, 000 more.
come on.
all right, we got to hit them hard when we go in.
all eyes on Carrie and Al. -The signal's coming from another block up.
069999, that is 20, 000.
just 5, 000 more.
someone's breached the garage.
clean this all up, then torch the place.
federal agents! Let me see your hands. Where's Padma Jindal?
no sign of Padma Jindal.
where is the intaglio press?
we just made the plates and the proofs here; she's printing somewhere else.
all right, she's probably printing where she's meeting her buyer.
we got to move, people, or $72 million goes flying out the window.
and Evan's killer.
there's a card missing from this board.
I... it was right on here. It had a number:
N2227SV." That's not a currency serial number.
no. That's a tail number.
come on.
remarkable work, Padma.
our friends in Jakarta will be very pleased.
were you careful to enter the country without tipping the authorities?
I was extremely careful.
our people can use these weapons against our true enemy.
the president of this arrogant country. -However you want to use them.
I'll take the money now. -You don't care much about the cause.
my entire cause is on the pallet.
then our struggle deserves the guns and the money.
FBI! Drop your weapon!
cover me on three. - I'll go.
no, I'll go. - Three.
hold your fire. Let me see your hands, let me see your hands.
drop your weapon.
get down on the floor. - All right, hold it right there.
get down!
new York gets her first.
plenty of charges to go around.
she's all yours, Jay.
you're under arrest for the murder of Evan Rusk.
what do we do with all this cash?
Ah, it's so beautiful.
a shame it has to burn.
acts as a deterrent to the bad guys.
you are an unbelievable pain in the ass, by the way.
you're gonna miss me when I'm gone.
no, I won't. - Yes, you will.
no. - Yeah.
because you just might be in Washington.
are you trying to recruit me, Special Agent?
I don't need to recruit people to have dinner with me.
see if you can remember this number. - Oh, well.
you seem awfully confident that I'm gonna call you.
I'm just overly confident that you owe me money.
you'll get your money back. You trust me, don't you?
not one bit. Hello. Simms.
I don't know if I made this clear, but he annoys me.
you made it crystal clear. -That guy...
Really? - Come on.
what? - Word on the DC streets... total player.
when I first met you, you had the same reputation, so it seems like I have a type.
I need you to throw the money on the pile there. -What money?
the stack you swiped at the hangar?-Don't have a stack.
throw it in, or I'll arrest you. -With handcuffs?
you will not arrest me. -Try me.
want to go to Mexico?
Mexico. - Mexico.
Oh, my gosh, look!
that's that boxer, Johnny D'Amato!
someone, call 911!
somebody help him! Johnny! - Call 911!
25 bucks is a steal. I mean, look at the set list.
you get "Nobody Weird Like Me," "Subway to Venus,
I mean, come on, it's a piece of Chili Pepper history.
recorded in town over at the 7 Club.
no. It wasn't.
I was at that show. Saturday, July 21, 1990.
first time I wore Doc Martens.
and the set list was, "Pretty Little Ditty," "Out in L. A.
nobody Weird Like Me," and the encore was a particularly awesome cover of "Dr. Funkenstein.
that is nothing more than a mix tape, not worth more than a dollar.
you calling me a fraud? -Yeah.
Oh, either that, or you're a total amateur. You choose.
Hey, Al. On my way.
what's going on? -Vic's Johnny D'Amato.
the boxer? -Yeah. Are you a fan?
ladies and gentleman, Johnny D'Amato, aka "The Face...
Yeah. I... I just sat a few rows away from him recently at the Pacquiao fight.
you were at that fight? - Yeah.
with who? -Uh, Frank... Francis.
Oh, Francis. - Yeah.
Mr. Secret Service Guy. -Mr. Secret Service Guy, yep.
for someone who protects the president, he seems to be spending a lot of time in New York.
well, you know, New York has a lot of... secrets that need servicing.
Uh-huh. - Hey, guys.
so, Johnny was the guest of honor at the festival this year.
he was supposed to sign autographs at 2: 00 p. m. right after the grand procession.
but instead, he showed up at 2: 15... - looking like this. - What about a canvass?
um, UNI's did an initial sweep before we got here. They didn't find anything.
so, Johnny dropped here, but this isn't where he was attacked?
any idea where the primary crime scene is?
Nope. CSU couldn't track the blood trail much further than a few yards.
too much foot traffic from the festival. -Anything else?
the last thing I have is from Johnny's driver, Moses Perriman.
Mr. Perriman says he picked up Johnny at his loft on Church, and then dropped him at the corner of Broadway and Walker at 13 hours.
that's at least ten blocks from here. Driver know where Johnny was headed?
no, but as far as I can tell, Moses was the last person to see him alive.
and, yeah, I got Jay to follow up with him.
all right, pull all the security footage from this area. Maybe we'll get lucky.
he sure was a hero to these folks. -Not if they saw his last fight.
word on the street is, Johnny threw it.
that would piss off a lot of people.
so, if Carrie's right and Johnny threw the fight, who do we think that would piss off?
everybody.
we're talking, managers, promoters, gamblers, all of them.
so, let's get a list together and... Holy crap, Al. That's Andre Kade.
the rapper. You know...
okay, stop that.
he's also Johnny's manager, which puts him at the top of our list.
listen, I'm sorry about the weapons ban.
Ah, E-Dawg, you know I hate having Mr. Parker have to give up his gun.
Yeah, I can't allow it in Major Crimes. I'm sorry, AK.
no, you're gonna be sorry if it goes missing. That Beretta 92FS is worth more than you make in a year.
luckily, I married rich.
AK, this is Lieutenant Al Burns.
ak has donated $100, 000 to find Johnny's killer.
that's right. Consider it a bounty.
dead or alive kind of deal? No. I mean, whatever helps.
Johnny was important to me. AK's been his manager for two years.
no, I've been a fan for even longer. That kid didn't know what he had or how to market it.
he was losing millions, so I reached out. -Who was handling him before?
nobody. I mean, he was.
well, him and that crusty trainer of his, Casey.
any idea who'd want Johnny dead or why anyone would want to kill him?
ak doesn't know anything. I've asked him already.
well, Johnny was a good guy. People respected him.
he was a killer in the ring, but he had a code.
that code include throwing $10 million bouts? -I heard about that, but I don't believe it.
Johnny was a true warrior. All he cared about was the fight.
no way he dumped it. Do you need anything else from me?
no. Thank you, AK. -Where were you this afternoon?
I would've thought you'd be there for Johnny at the festival.
well, I had business in Vegas over the weekend. I came over here as soon as my plane touched down.
all right, so if we're done with the questions.
you need anything, bro, call me on my cell.
E-Dawg? -We go sailing sometimes.
those are some very interesting circles you're spinning in, Eliot.
don't waste your time being envious of me.
I got the Boxing Commission, the Italian-American Society and the world's largest hip-hop mogul on my ass, and I haven't had my afternoon cappuccino.
find the guy who wanted this kid killed. Please and thank you.
Oh, what a shame. I used to love to watch him move.
you were a fan, too?
Oh, I've been a devotee of the sweet science for years.
I used to moonlight as the on-call doctor for the Golden Gloves when I was a resident at Beth Israel.
Joe Frazier once sent me flowers for resetting his nose in the middle of a match.
I still miss it.
how does a world champion boxer end up like this?
I don't know. Okay.
cause of death was asphyxiation. He choked on his own blood.
it's pretty straightforward.
the X-rays are useless too many breaks to figure anything out.
I know you want an I. D. on the weapon, but right now, all I can say is he was hit with something.
how's that for being specific? -Not very.
I'm considering, because most of the bruising has a circular shape, that maybe he was hit with the end of a metal pipe.
maybe. I really won't know for sure until I boil his head.
Oh, I know it sounds awful when you say it out loud, but it's what I got to do.
Oh. Right after my protein bar. I'm on a new program.
I finally spoke to Johnny's mother, Maria.
she was getting ready for the festival when some uniforms broke the news.
she's hysterical. Says she has no idea who would do this to her son.
she know anything about Johnny throwing his last fight?
no. She never saw his fights, never wanted to know anything about them.
and as a mother, I get it. Does he have any other family?
seems there's a father who's been out of the picture for years, lives in Honolulu.
but there is an older brother, Bobby.
she know where Bobby might be? - She didn't.
I checked his apartment and he wasn't there.
apparently, he works as a day laborer around the city.
she doesn't know which site he's working today.
track him down, we got to talk to him. - Yeah.
so, Eliot knows AK? -Sailing buddies.
okay, anyways, I was doing a little research into Johnny D'Amato, because I'm more of a Mixed Martial Arts guy.
ak may not believe that Johnny took a dive, but he is in the minority.
check it out.
facebook, Twitter, Tumblr they're all saying the same thing:
something was up with that fight.
now, take a look at round three.
see, Johnny just drops his gloves. I mean, come on, who does that?
sure doesn't look like the Johnny D'Amato I'm used to seeing.
was he as good as they say? - Oh, yeah.
he was like the Italian American Sugar Ray Leonard. Oh, you mean, the lightweight?
lightweight? Jay, as a New Yorker, as a sports fan, you need to appreciate. Sugar Ray Leonard is a legend.
well, do you appreciate Anderson "The Spider" Silva? Or Fedor Emelianenko?
no. - Oh, get out of here.
and they were the greatest fighters of all time in my sport, so we're even.
no, we're not even. Boxing is an art.
that stuff you watch is a blood sport. See, you say that like it's a bad thing.
so, if Johnny took a dive, why'd he do it? -Maybe someone ordered him to.
like somebody owned him. -Could be.
check with Organized Crime.
see if you can find a financial link to anybody who may have had Johnny under their thumb.
go back as far as you have to. -No problem.
you know who'd be really pissed off if Johnny actually threw that fight?
his trainer, Casey McGraw. -Makes sense.
in addition to a couple of battery raps he had as a teenager, look what he did to fighters who didn't give a hundred percent.
he broke one guy's arm, cracked five ribs on somebody else.
I don't even get why anybody would train with him. -He was the best.
fighters thought he was worth the risk.
but you got to wonder what Casey would do if one of his greatest fighters took a dive.
everybody loved Johnny. Nobody wanted to kill him.
besides that, I got nothing to say. -Ah, come on.
Casey, we got so much to talk about.
yeah? Like what?
well, I don't know.
like Jack Dempsey, the "Manassa Mauler.
1920, he was the man.
83 fights, 65 wins, 11 draws, six losses, one no contest.
and I'm always up for chatting about Sugar Ray Robinson, the original pound-for-pound king.
look, we just need a minute of your time.
for Johnny.
take a break!
all right, you've seen my sheet. Cops aren't my favorite people.
I got five minutes. What do you want to know? -What happened to your hand?
I, uh, split a knuckle. Part of the job.
where were you about 1: 00 p. m? -At home.
can anybody confirm that? -My cat.
all right, what's this about?
you think I had something to do with what happened to Johnny?
whoever killed Johnny killed me. Johnny was the best.
he was my best.
Casey, you hear what people are saying about Johnny's last fight?
there's no way he threw it.
I saw those knockdowns, Casey.
it... it didn't look good.
well, he was distracted that morning, uh...
riled up, but... not in a good way.
he say what was bothering him? -No. Johnny... kept it to himself.
he kept quiet most of the time. He... just kept it inside, you know?
but there's no way he took a dive.
it's not how I trained him. He... he wouldn't do that.
not to me. -You were like a father to him, huh?
I mean, you took care of him after his father left. -Yeah, him and his brother both.
I mean, they were like all the kids around here.
but Johnny, he was... he was different from the rest.
I mean, I knew he had that special sauce.
and that face.
Oh, forget about it.
he was a star.
I want to show you something. Okay, just look at this.
you see that? - Yeah.
Johnny was quick as a rabbit.
that's what he was known for, "the combination."
there's not many people can finish a combination with the same hand.
right hook, left uppercut, left cross. -That's not bad.
you want to, uh, pop your hips at the end. You'd be surprised the difference it makes.
yeah? - Yeah.
this one's got the special sauce, too, huh? -Yeah. She's saucy, all right.
Thanks.
Hey, Al.
I've been doing a little research, and as a New Yorker and a sports fan,
I feel obligated to tell you that your boy, Sugar Ray Leonard, lost three times in his career.
what's your point, Jay? - Oh, I'm just saying, you know...
how many losses does your guy Silva have?
well, that's not really relevant, is it? - Six.
you're not the only one around here knows how to do research.
okay, so anyways, this is what I wanted to show you.
Johnny had some unusual connections.
you see this lady?
she's been in tons of photos with Johnny over the years; her name is Dafina Dervishi.
Dervishi? As in Agim and Edon Dervishi?
afraid so. -So we're talking Albanian mob.
Yep. And that's not all.
I checked with NCIC;
it turns out, Johnny filed individual restraining orders - against four members of the Dervishi family just three weeks ago. - Why?
doesn't say.
it's just a standard "stay 1, 500 feet the hell away from me" kind.
anyways, let me introduce you to the family.
Agim, Edon, Megi and Dafina. Agim's married to Dafina.
Edon is Agim's brother. And Megi is married to Edon.
now, I know they don't look it, but... these folks are scary as hell.
way to show off with Casey back there, pulling out all the boxing stats.
okay, I was not showing off. I was engaging a possible suspect.
besides, I've always loved boxing. Where do you think I got my sexy right hook?
Oh, the one you used on me? I wouldn't describe it as "sexy.
december, 2001, Syracuse Christmas party.
I believe we were dating, and you were hitting on the bartender. - Oh, I was not hitting on her.
I was engaging a confidential informant. -She was a slut. What is going on here?
I don't know.
the cops. This is perfect.
thank you, God. Come on. Come on.
Frank, keep rolling, keep rolling, keep rolling.
Hey, hey, hey. Shut that off.
Hey, you're not my executive producer. - No, I am not.
I'm the guy who could lock you up for obstructing.
shut that off! - Wait-waitwait-wait.
we were just about to blow out the candles. What are you doing?
we're here about the murder of Johnny D'Amato.
sure, I knew Johnny; we all grew up together. You didn't just know him though, right?
you subsidized him before he went pro.
we found a lot of money flowing from your bank accounts into Johnny's.
Yeah, I've been helping Johnny's poor ass out ever since high school.
me and my girls, we all have a cut of him. It's like a syndicate.
you know, like what they have with horses, and, uh, other studs?
like, you owned him?
no, nobody owned Johnny. We forgave a debt.
it was like we were proud of him. So what were the restraining orders about?
our show, Staten Island Syndicate Wives. He was pissed off that we kept taping him but whatever.
we were exciting enough without him, anyway. Besides, Johnny was kind of a jerk.
you loved him, but he was a jerk. Which is it?
both. Johnny was a home-wrecker.
he was stepping out with my slut-bag sister-in-law over there.
my brother-in-law, Edon, is such an idiot.
I told him he shouldn't marry her.
anyone who goes shopping at the Outlet Collection at Jersey Gardens, gonna be cheap in more ways than one. Megi was cheating with Johnny?
you know this for a fact? -I know she was cheating with somebody.
she had the hots for Johnny ever since high school. It was bound to happen eventually.
I mean, I love her, but she's a putane, which means...
he knows what that means. Did Edon know about this theory of yours?
so, you think I let the cat out of the bag, huh? That I just set my own brother-in-law up for murder?
there's no way that I would even be talking to you if I didn't know for a fact that Scorsese over there has been filming us 24 hours a day, all week.
and you can check the tape, so... You have to pay for Johnny!
all right, relax.
it was them. Johnny's dead because of them!
they kill Johnny!
all they wanted was for Johnny to be famous. But if he hadn't been famous, he'd still be alive!
Johnny's dead because of them! - Bobby...
put the bat down. -They took my brother.
you don't want your mother to bury two sons in one week, right?
put it down.
we've been looking for you, Bobby. Where you been?
I don't know. Nowhere.
I can't believe he's gone.
I can't believe it.
what makes you think they're involved in Johnny's death?
because Johnny told me he was afraid of them.
did he say why? They're connected, you know that, right?
they're mobbed up from... from some country I don't even know where.
Albania. It's north of Greece. -Whatever.
these people, they knew that Johnny was gonna make it big, so they wanted to get him under their wing. Taking him out, paying for stuff.
I wanted to tell him to stay away, but what am I gonna do, you know?
tell my brother not to live his dream? -Any specific threats?
Yeah, a couple of months ago.
I don't know what it was about, but Johnny told me they wanted him to do something that he didn't want to do.
he said he didn't want me involved. He said he wanted to... protect me.
my baby brother.
if only I'd been there today. I shouldn't have gone to work.
I... I needed the money.
like, ever since my old man left, I swore to my mother that I would take care of Johnny,
I would look out for him.
what am I supposed to say? How do I face her?
please... Please, you got to find who did this.
let's get you a ride home.
Hey, guys. Okay, so here's the deal.
I'm getting you all that Syndicate footage ASAP, just like you asked, because I'm all about helping the NYPD.
that's great.
can I just say that what happened here, with the guns and you and the Albanians and the guy it was amazing.
you both were amazing. Real American hero-type stuff.
I just got three words for you to think about:
major Crimes NYC.
on TV. On cable. -That's seven words.
nine, actually. -You don't want to be cable-famous?
cable famous? Al?
you're already famous in my eyes. -Guess that's a no.
well, you know where I am if you change your mind.
you're missing out. We can make a lot of money.
the depths of the cracks would indicate to me that Johnny was punched to death.
which is weird. He's a boxer, and there are no defensive wounds.
his blood alcohol came back at 13 percent, there were no drugs in his body, so he was conscious at the time of the attack.
and the alcohol might have slowed him down, but not enough.
Yeah, yeah. And look.
you see those scratches around the area of the impact?
that would be consistent... -With a heavy ring.
Johnny was really worked over.
the fact that his lower teeth were knocked out, to me, says...
uppercut.
the temporal bone, shattered.
that could indicate a right hook.
and these cracks are very deep, and that could mean...
straight left cross. -Exactly.
you see that? Johnny was quick as a rabbit.
that's what he was known for, "the combination."
right hook, left uppercut, left cross.
Johnny was killed by his own combination.
no, no, no. I'm not stirring nothing! This is my family you're talking about.
what do you think I'm supposed to say?! -Gimme. Gimme.
Hey, you.
you tell her that if she's gonna keep spreading lies as often as she spreads her legs...
...that I'm gonna come over there and end her.
all right, thank you.
murray's on her way over to Gleason's.
I don't like that split knuckle, and I don't like his weak-ass cat alibi.
what's up?
not my IQ, since I started watching the Staten Island Syndicate Wives footage.
I've gotten to know the real Dervishis pretty darn well.
come on, you look like a thug, Edon.
dinner tonight's, like, fancy. -Hey, get that thing out of my face.
you make me look like a girl. -I don't make you look like a girl.
I try to make you look presentable. -Hey, I am presentable.
Oh. Is that what that whore down at the bar tells you?
cuckoo. - That you're presentable?
you're crazy! - Like some kind of bitch...
okay. What about their alibis?
airtight. Want to see what the family was up to around Johnny's time of death?
Hey, this is my bedroom. This is where I sleep with my wife.
you're dead, idiot! Shut...
I actually looked that up. You don't want to know what he's saying, trust me.
you're kidding me with this.
I know, but, you know, once I started watching it, I really couldn't stop.
like the day Agim got a pedicure. You got to see it; it's... pretty funny.
baby, baby. Come sit down.
what the...? Eh.
make it quick; I have a sandwich. -Baby, you are gonna love it.
you deserve to be pampered.
you are my... mm. - You're such a sweet... mm.
don't forget his toes, too, please. -Not the toes, baby.
they're disgusting.
wait, Jay, stop. Right there. Go back.
that girl tighten up on her.
there's not many people can throw a combo finishing with the same hand.
there was a photo of her in Casey's office.
does he have a granddaughter, a niece, anything like that?
Yep. A granddaughter, Anna McGraw. -What's she doing in this footage?
well, hold on, there's more of her.
it's a big man with a little stick. -Hey, you talking about my husband?!
huh? Say it again.
this must've been before Johnny's restraining order kicked in.
you know, his mom said he wasn't seeing anybody. -Well, she was wrong.
they're in a relationship, all right.
but I can tell you something else: the way he's touching her, I think she's pregnant.
look at that
d... do you have an address for her?
Yep. 251 Walker Street.
okay, that is one block from where Johnny's driver dropped him off.
that's where Johnny stopped before the festival.
maybe Casey was there, found out about the relationship, about the pregnancy.
Casey's a pretty traditional guy. She just graduated from college.
I'm guessing he didn't like the situation. -Sounds like motive to me.
no. I saw Casey's face. How he felt about Johnny.
I'm not buying it. - All right.
Murray, you got eyes on Casey?
almost. -Good.
we're gonna need you to bring him in. -Sorry, Al.
Casey's not going anywhere.
he's dead.
not really sure what this was about if it wasn't personal.
there's no sign of a forced entry. No struggle.
the safe was left untouched. -So this was an execution.
connected to Johnny's murder? -You know how I feel about coincidences.
Yeah, you're not a fan. -Right.
get me a list of everybody who's been in and out of the building in the last 24 hours.
you got it.
thank you for coming down.
what's happening?
why is everybody dying? -I know this is hard.
losing your grandfather... and losing Johnny.
you knew about me and Johnny?
Anna, is there anybody you know...
who would want to hurt your grandfather?
no. Everybody loved him.
he was like a father to half the kids in the neighborhood.
he... had such a good heart.
what about Johnny?
no.
I mean, I... I don't know other fighters.
I never saw that side of him, the...
the killer they said he was in the ring.
with me......he was gentle.
he was the father of your child.
but I lost the baby.
six weeks ago. Sunday.
sorry to hear that.
but when I told him, he was so sweet.
he said it made him... understand what was important.
he was gonna quit boxing. Open a gym with my grandfather.
they were celebrating that morning.
right before Johnny died.
we were gonna tell my grandfather that we were together.
and that we were gonna get married.
we were gonna try again.
to start a family.
so that's why Johnny was so distracted during his last fight.
he just found out Anna lost the baby.
poor girl. - Yeah.
so, if Johnny was quitting and going into business with Casey, that may give us the link between the two crimes.
Mm. Well, I followed up with Bobby's alibi.
time card shows he was clocked in over at Mari-Tan Construction in Long Island City for his entire shift.
okay. - Hmm.
and ballistics came back on the slug Webster pulled from Casey's chest.
it was a nine millimeter. It came from a Beretta 92FS.
you know who packs a Beretta 92FS?
ak's bodyguard, Mr. Parker.
Johnny tell you he was quitting boxing and going into business with Casey?
he did. - And you didn't think to mention that back at Major Crimes?
no. Johnny wanted to quit the pro circuit every five minutes.
he called it a circus. He didn't care about the money.
you weren't very fond of Casey, were you? You did an interview last year, March 3, for ESPN.
you were quoted as saying, "Casey was like an old mule who needed to be put out to pasture.
good memory.
I stand by that. - Well, then, you should be happy to hear that he's dead;
shot right through the heart.
whoa. Uh, not that way. Not retire permanently.
Really?
last month, you set up a $40 million fight for Johnny in Vegas.
Johnny going into business with Casey would've messed that up.
we're supposed to believe you were cool with that?
detective, I've got a lot on my plate. So if you could get to the point.
here's the point: we think you had Mr. Parker kill Johnny.
then you had him kill Casey. You were in Vegas yesterday, but we checked your plane's manifest.
Mr. Parker wasn't on it. He never left the city.
I think we're done here.
I gave you my time out of respect for Eliot, but now... you can talk to my lawyer.
okay. We'll leave.
right after you give me the Beretta on your right hip.
I'm not giving up Bonnie. -Don't worry, Mr. Parker.
Bonnie's not going anywhere without a warrant. -You named your gun "Bonnie.
that's cute.
he was stepping out with my slut-bag sister-in-law. -Can I ask you a question?
what's it like to kiss a girl with a lip ring?
a diamond one, no less.
you're the one who's been having an affair with Megi, aren't you?
that's her in your ad.
I don't care how famous you are or how many guns with fancy names your Mr. Parker has.
what do you think's gonna happen when an Albanian mobster finds out you're sleeping with his wife?
it would be really bad for you if that got out.
this one's not too good at keeping secrets.
Aw, thanks.
gold plated? -Eliot's not gonna like you taking Mr. Parker's only gun.
now, that's not his only gun, is it?
he also has a registered Desert Eagle 50 caliber, don't you?
let me guess, you call that one "Clyde," right?
Yeah, Murray.
Really?
so, that gentleman over there was Dumpster diving for dinner, and he found this.
we know whose blood this is? -Not yet.
the lab's putting a rush on it. After we got the call, CSU came out, luminoled the area, and they found blood on these pallets.
I thought you guys might want to take a look.
Thanks.
you know, these pallets they haven't moved since we were here yesterday, Al.
look at the way they're set up. Just like a hiding place, right?
what if he was hiding there the whole time?
could've used our arrival at the scene as a diversion.
and then walked right out of here.
Johnny's brother was here. He said he wasn't anywhere near the festival.
but he lied; I saw him.
Hey, Bobby! We need to talk to you for a minute, okay?
I need a 10-85 at Mari-Tan Construction. 39th and Vernon.
Al! Al! Behind you!
take it from me, that's gonna hurt for a while.
you popped your hips on that one.
we found Johnny's blood all over your toolbox.
and his championship ring.
he gives you his championship ring, and you... kill him with it.
I got to say, you impressed me. The stunt you pulled at the Dervishis', where you showed up and accused them on camera, and then...
you get a co-worker to punch your time card for you, so your alibi is golden.
I mean, you're a smart guy, Bobby. -I don't know what you're talking about.
Johnny was supporting you, wasn't he? Which is... which is what a brother should do.
but it's weird, because we looked into his financials, and about a month ago, the checks he was sending you they stopped.
he was cutting you off, wasn't he?
Yeah.
Yeah, I begged him.
I told him I just needed a little more time to get on my feet.
but he said no.
you begged you brother for help, and he said no?
look, that's why I went to the festival to... to talk with him.
but he wouldn't listen.
so I hit him.
and he didn't hit you back, did he?
no, no. And I'm thinking, what?
what, I'm... I'm not good enough?
like, my baby brother thinks that I'm some kind of schmuck that he doesn't even need to put his hands up? Like I'm nothing?
so you hit him again and again to get him to hit you back, to get him to fight. Right?
I... I don't know. I guess so.
I didn't mean to kill him. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.
that might not do it. -Doesn't matter.
he was drunk, they're fighting. Most he gets is manslaughter for the brother.
and Johnny's a fighter. Bobby may walk on self-defense.
which is why we need to get him for the trainer. -Carrie have enough?
she will.
you know who I met? Casey.
your brother's trainer, Casey.
I... I didn't like him.
what did you think of Casey?
you know, I wanted to train with Casey.
see, I was there first.
I was sweeping up that gym when I was ten years old.
and what then? He... he meets Johnny and...?
Yeah. Casey saw Johnny... it's like I never existed.
and the two of them just cut you out? -Yeah.
I mean, Casey wouldn't even let me into the gym to watch my brother box.
you know those gyms that... that Johnny and Casey were gonna build together? - Yeah.
so, I asked my brother, "C... can I help out"?
can I get a piece of something?
and before he can even answer me, Casey's there saying, "No. No, no, no. It... it's time to cut him off.
that I was a parasite. -He called you a parasite?
Johnny was your brother, he was your blood. Casey was the parasite.
that's right. And he took my brother right out from under me.
all of this is Casey's fault. He's the reason you guys weren't close anymore.
and I'll tell you something, if I had a Beretta, I would've walked up and shot him through the heart, too.
that's right, that's why I killed him. He took everything from me.
everything!
I never meant to hurt Johnny.
I never meant to hurt Johnny.
I believe you.
I do.
confession whisperer.
that was nicely done.
especially like the way you played the empathy card with Bobby, drew him out.
well, that's my version of a rope-a-dope.
it's a boxing term, Eliot. Stick to sailing.
speaking of which, just to prove that there's no hard feelings,
ak doubled the money that he intended to use for the reward and he donated it to the local Boys and Girls Club in Johnny and Casey's names.
Aw, well, I am sure you will be at that photo op.
he also donated a case of his new vodka, Vodka Kade, to Major Crimes.
now, that is thoughtful, because I could use a drink right now.
I mean, of course, you know, I couldn't accept it.
it's in your trunk, isn't it? No, no. Not his style.
it's at his Hamptons house.
Oh. To which, by the way...
uh... oh, that's right, neither of you are ever invited again.
so... are you actually dating Mr. Secret Service Guy now?
define "dating"."
was it five dates?
define "date.
you know what, you're right.
none of my business.
next time, I'm the one taking you to a fight.
why wait?
let's do it right now.
right here. - Right here?
right now. Let's do it.
yeah?
Oh, finally get my rematch, huh? -Let's go.
Yeah. I'm ready for that right hook this time.
put them up. Come on. - Come on.
come on. Come on. Come on.
come on. Come on. Come on, right here. Come on.
why are you dancing around like that?
what's wrong with you? - You got to "Bob and weave."
show me, come on. - "Bob and weave"?
put your hands up; this is a fight. You know we're just sparring, right?
Yeah.
it is our civic duty to mold New York into a city that matches our highest aspirations.
and your thoughtful and passionate contribution to that effort only strengthens my commitment.
thank you.
and then I'll announce my decision and any clapping will be drowned out by the boos.
the right decision isn't always the most popular one, Scott. I hope I didn't teach you that.
earliest night you've knocked off this week. Where am I taking you?
home, Larry.
good night, Suzy.
commissioner? It's me, Larry.
we have that announcement this morning. I'm here to pick you up.
Mr. Standley!
Varick! Hey, Varick, come back here!
you thought you could get away from me.
Hey, it's Super Memory Woman!
okay. Hello!
Oh, no, no.
you're gonna have to do a lot better than that. Okay, now!
tricky, tricky.
are you ready for this?
here we go. - Yep.
and... I'm...
Lulu! Are you a witch?
that would depend on who you ask.
my phone's ringing. Go play, you guys. Have fun.
you're nuts running on a day like this. Ever heard of heat stroke?
I barely got started running before you called me and I'm trying to beat my 10K record.
proving what, exactly?
proving that I'm better now than I was in 1993.
just competing against yourself. Yeah, well, you got to beat the best to be the best.
all right, our victim is Scott Standley, Zoning Board Commissioner.
that's a powerful position. Yet I never heard of him.
you have anything on him in that head of yours?
no. I'm drawing a total blank.
see? Running in this heat's melting your brain.
I don't know...
Standley's aide, Larry Borman, discovered the body about 8: 30 a. m.
he got in using a key Standley had given him.
no sign of forced entry. I'm thinking our victim let his killer in.
all right.
cleared the aide?
Ah, claims he was with his girlfriend on 21st Street all night.
murray's looking into it.
looks like two shots to the chest; used a pillow to muffle the sound.
5, 000-piece puzzle.
learning Portuguese.
I don't know, the... puzzle, the cat, learning a new language...
seems like a lonely guy looking for a distraction.
I know you're all wondering if I hit my trips, boys, but...
you're gonna have to pay to find out.
something?
no. Nothing.
so, the aide's alibi holds up. Girlfriend and the doorman confirm his story.
you track Standley's movements yesterday?
he went in to the office at 8: 00 in the morning, worked late with his staff, went home.
they say he seemed upset, worried about anything? Not anything out of the ordinary.
his wife just passed from cancer ten months ago, so he'd been pretty down.
I didn't see any cameras in the lobby of Standley's building.
what about out on his street? - Nothing.
but I'm all over his cell records. Maybe we'll get lucky.
Jay! What do you got?
got a bio on the guy, not much else.
meet Scott Standley, 42, Zoning Board Commissioner for New York City.
served under the last four mayors in some capacity.
before he worked for the city, he ran a non-profit for underprivileged kids.
violent end for a do-gooder, no?
I did look into some of Standley's recent work decisions.
just last week, he approved this community park up in the Bronx.
grass for the community, playgrounds for the kids... but yes, $20 million in billings to the contractor who won the bid.
so, a guy creates a windfall for winning bidders and bad feelings for those he passes on.
big money, big motive.
okay. Standley made three personal phone calls yesterday on his cell phone, all to the same number...
a burner cell. I'm trying to track it.
why is a successful political like this guy living in a tiny apartment and making calls to burner cells?
it doesn't track.
I mean, get into his finances, check his emails, threats, disgruntled colleagues, anything.
how's it coming?
fine. Um... I think everything's pretty straightforward.
I'll put the time of death at about 1: 00 a. m. I sent you the report.
Yeah, no, I-I got it, I just, uh...
you know, I was just wondering if there was anything else that maybe, you know...
is everything all right? Can't a person just drop by anymore?
a person can, but you can't.
okay. The truth is...
I need your advice.
Oh, it's about the Secret Service guy.
you've been dating a few months, he's throwing around the "E" word.
well, honestly, if you ask me, exclusivity is overrated.
I was dating a guy, he was a trustee at the children's zoo and he said, "Baboons have it down.
the females just go out and expose their tushes to the troops - and the troops bow down and applaud... -" No. No. Jo. Jo.
my issue isn't the Secret Service guy.
m-my issue is that I, uh...
I knew our victim. You knew him?
Yeah. - How?
well, I met him about four months ago, he said his name was Marty.
I didn't sleep with him.
um, we were engaged in...
a GAME of chance.
you're gambling. I thought you stopped.
I did. But I started again.
and anyway, you know, we didn't really talk or anything.
I mean, he just sat across the poker table from me and...
have you told Al? - No.
no. I needed your advice first. What do I do?
really, we don't know if that has anything to do with the investigation.
exactly... and so why would I go and tell Al and get him mad...?
no, but it might. My advice would be to run with it.
the killer's out there, suppose he kills again?
right. So I should definitely tell Al, then, right?
so, this guy Standley was basically Mr. Clean.
murray's going over his phone records, online history... but there's nothing.
he wasn't dating anybody. No evidence of drug use.
are you even listening to me? I met Standley gambling...
at a card room on the Upper West Side about four months ago.
I recognized him when I saw his dead body.
you were playing poker? - Yes.
and I know I told you I would quit and I did, I did for a while.
for a while? Are you forgetting what it took to cover your ass last time - In Chinatown? - No. I know.
if Tom Stoddard hadn't owed me a favor... - I appreciate that!
Oh, well, not enough that you would stop doing it.
it's because I'm weak and reckless. - Selfish.
and selfish. - Stupid.
self-destructive. - I'm not stupid.
Yeah, stupid. And you're my partner.
you're compromising an investigation.
I know. And I have put you in an impossible situation and I'm gonna fix it.
I'm gonna fix it because I'm gonna talk to Eliot, okay?
he's gonna go ballistic.
I know. - It's gonna be the last conversation you ever have with him.
Yeah, I know. - Okay. I'll go with you.
no. I don't want to compromise you any more than I already have. I'm gonna go on my own,
I'm a big girl, I'm just gonna... face the music.
what are you gonna say?
all right. Okay. Here it is.
Scott Standley was gambling in underground casinos.
okay. You believe...
this is connected to why he was murdered?
I'm not sure.
okay, why do I have the odd feeling that there's something more?
well, I know this...
well, because I remember him from one of the casinos.
one of those... casinos that you, yourself...were gambling at?
Yes. - I see.
what exactly do you expect me to do with this information?
I, I thought you should know. You... thought I should know...
that one of my detectives, a New York City police officer, working in the Major Crimes Bureau, an officer sworn to uphold the law...
was committing a felony?
here it is THE THING, w-we need to investigate gambling as a lead and I thought you should know the basis...
of that investigation... - Thank you.
you can go now.
so, you don't have anymore questions for me about, you know, maybe how often I gamble?
if it's maybe, a problem for me? Do I win much?
I most certainly do not have any more questions like that. - Because I always win...
I do, however, have one question, which I will ask again:
will you please leave my office? Sure.
are you mad?
I'm not...
okay.
Hey, Al...
commissioner Standley's bank records.
now, this guy's been draining his accounts over the last nine months.
downsized apartments from the Upper West Side to Alphabet City.
if he was corrupt, he sure as hell wasn't too good at it.
he made some pretty huge withdrawals, too. Look, $3, 000 on one day, $5, 000 on another.
what's he doing with that cash? Loneliness can be a gateway to all sorts of vices.
if we find out where his money was going, I bet we find out why he was killed.
Hey. It turns out Standley had a sizeable life insurance policy from the city... and get this:
he changed his beneficiary three weeks ago.
who's getting the money? Standley's assistant...
lonely widower makes his beautiful assistant his beneficiary and three weeks later, he's killed.
well, maybe Suzy got tired of answering the phones.
it's crazy. We were all just here.
I feel like he's gonna walk right through that door.
there was no one he was particularly at odds with?
nothing he was working on recently that went south?
look, it's city politics, of course there was disagreements, but people loved working with Scott.
he was fair and people respected that.
did he change at all, after his wife died? Did his behavior become more erratic?
no. Nothing like that. Um... he worked more after Colleen died.
and do you think he used his influence for personal profit?
no. No way.
a company lobbying to build a factory in Queens sent over a bouquet after his wife's funeral and...
and he made me send it back. He was incorruptible.
that would strike me as odd, that he would make you his life insurance beneficiary three weeks before he was killed.
what are you talking about? You didn't know?
all $200, 000 is yours.
no. I... I know that he doesn't have a family, but that's incredibly weird. He didn't say a word.
maybe the lonely widower was starting to look at you in a more personal way.
al... He was more like a brother.
you two spent a lot of time together, feelings build... - AL
do you know where he went when he wasn't working?
Larry would know. Larry Borman, his aide.
they spent a lot more time outside of the office.
excuse me. - Sure.
why'd you step on my affair angle? I was getting signals from her.
you were getting signals from her? Really?
were you also getting signals from her wife?
Yeah.
sure, I picked him up in the mornings sometimes.
took him to meetings. Once in a while, I'd drive him home.
you ever drive him anywhere else? No, not really.
you know, he lived a pretty simple life.
after Colleen died, he'd pretty much been keeping to himself.
Yeah. I understand that. After my husband passed, I kept to myself, too.
sometimes you get lonely. You need something to fill that void.
I know I did. I did some things I wasn't too proud of.
you see any of that behavior in Mr. Standley?
Hey, look, it wasn't a big deal, but in the last couple of months before he died, he started having me take him to bars.
Larry, was there one bar in particular you took him to?
Yeah. Lonnegan's on the Lower East Side.
he started having me drop him there a couple months ago.
okay. When was the last time you took him to Lonnegan's?
two nights ago.
all the bars in New York, and this is where Standley came to unwind?
Yeah, well, you forgot your skinny jeans and your moustache.
is drinking beer out of a can a thing again?
haven't seen that since Cavanaugh's, back in Syracuse.
tuesday night PBRs led to an epic game of truth or dare.
you won.
turned out we could sneak into the ladies' room and go undetected.
I think we both won. For 11 mind-blowing minutes.
I thought it was longer.
our victim was Scott Standley, Zoning Board Commissioner.
no sign of forced entry... Interesting.
okay, listen, I just saw a guy who used a pocket watch to gain access to the back room.
now Standley had the exact same watch in his apartment.
he wasn't coming here to drink. You think there's a casino in there?
Yeah, I do. And he was here the night before he was killed.
I gotta get in there.
don't even think about it. - Why?!
we-we could go in and check things out from the inside.
we can't just go inand shut it down, 'cause we're not gonna learn anything that way.
you really think Eliot's gonna let you go undercover at an underground casino?
sure. Of course. It's a brilliant idea.
how could he say no?
no.
look, we tracked Standley to an underground casino. The same one you saw him in?
one I haven't been to. - Oh, imagine that.
his aide confirmed he was there the night before he was murdered.
now I've been digging around and I've got some contacts who say Standley was asking for a big loan.
he was asking loan sharks for $180, 000.
so, we're thinking either he lost money gambling, took out a big loan and he couldn't repay it, or he pissed off the wrong guy at the card table.
so we go undercover at the casino... we find the killer.
right... Well, I mean, in order for that to really work, my God, a person would have to have built up a lot of cred...
gambling at... - Oh.
such establishments. That's a year ago.
the Chanel is a little out of style, but I do think, I do think you'd pull it off.
Oh, thank you very much.
how did you get...? - You don't really think
I was gonna hire you two without doing my research, did you?
this one, oh, look, four months ago. That's the warehouse down on Grover.
Yeah, it's Fulton, actually, and I am very flattered that you've been spying on me.
relax, Wells.
I'm just keeping tabs on my dream team. What do you have on Al?
al? Uh... you know, well, four unpaid parking tickets outside the same curry house in Astoria.
and I seem to recall an unlicensed woodworking class in Dumbo.
yawn. Life in the fast lane, huh?
I made a magazine rack. Mahogany.
I trust...
that you understand the blowback that could come down on this unit if others from City Hall or the department find out about your little habit?
you found out about my little habit and you haven't fired me yet, why?
Really? I mean, would you fire you?
no.
you're going undercover.
Yes! Both of you.
Oh, look at that.
here's THE DEAL if I win again, I don't have to wear this necklace.
Carrie, if you don't wear the necklace camera, we can't see what's happening inside the casino.
Jay, if I do wear the necklace camera,
I run the risk of looking like a real housewife of Beverly Hills.
this thing is huge.
I bought a necklace just like that a few years ago, for my sister, - and she loved it. - Ah, that's very, very cute that you still believe that. Hey.
murray got a tip on this loan shark. - Mm!
Dean Gray from West Orange. Multiple arrests and he may be working inside this casino.
all right, are you ready?
three of diamonds, jack of spades, four of hearts, ten of clubs, seven of spades.
damn. I've seen her use her friggin' memory a million times and she still hustles me.
okay.
now...
now with both of you wearing your cameras, we'll be able to see what you're doing,
I. D. whoever's inside the casino, all right?
and you... are gonna teach me how to do this one day.
over a beer. - Fair enough. I'll buy.
all right. - Good luck, guys.
listen, got us into the casino, we're all good.
I had my bookie Zeke vouch for us.
you got a bookie named Zeke who vouches for you?
Yeah. I told him you were my new sugar daddy, so you should start practicing your part.
who's your old sugar daddy?
wouldn't you like to know. - Yeah.
let me ask you, do you moonlight as a gambler or as a cop? I am not... a gambler.
gamblers lose, I win.
Ooh, nice "murse," Eliot.
you want to pass as a high roller, you have to bet like a high roller.
no catnip for Kitty. You're the bank.
huh. Put the responsible one in charge... that's smart.
wait a second, I'm the one playing at the big table.
precisely, if you have a cold night, I can trust Al not to lose all that cash.
I can't even tell you what I did for the commissioner for him to okay this.
we won't ask, you don't tell.
the cash comes back... every penny of it.
Oh, yeah, and um... it'd also be nice if you found Standley's killer.
they're heading in.
Hey. How you doing?
this way.
step inside. State your name.
Oh, thank you.
a photo booth! Hmm!
well, this is cool.
come on. - All right.
here we go.
smile, Charlie.
good evening.
nice place. Yeah... I can see the allure.
okay. Roulette for you, red and black... you can handle that.
sydney, Charlie, I'm Molly, your hostess.
Zeke tells me your lady's quite a player, Charlie. She does okay.
well, this is quite something.
I mean, I've been in a lot of card rooms, but never one like this.
I think you'll see, we cater to a higher-end player than the other rooms in town.
we offer all the games:
blackjack, craps, roulette and of course, poker.
sydney, I already placed you on the wait-list for the high-stakes table.
thank you. How is the action tonight? - Mmm, some loose players, some tight.
you might have your hands full. I think I'll manage.
she's trying to work on her confidence.
well, I aim to pamper our VIPs, so please let me know if there's anything I can do for you.
thank you. She's perky.
keep it in your holster, Charlie.
sir.
all right, here we go. My pleasure.
thank you.
tonight's gonna be fun.
I'm gonna win. Okay.
no... you gotta earn your allowance with me, Sydney.
I give you money in exchange for some sugar. That's how these relationships work.
you owe me back pay...
daddy.
daddy." Really?
how they doing?
boss, I've got facial recognition working overtime.
this place is not lacking in suspects. Most of the security guards have sheets.
well, it takes a criminal to run a criminal operation.
now, Carrie's got to watch out for this guy when she sits down at the poker table.
alexander Sapic. Serbian mobster.
suspected of dismembering a guy after he took him for big cash in Monte Carlo.
charming guy. Who's that Al's taken an interest in?
Oh, that's... Molly McGintee. I think she's the hostess or something.
smart kid.
was a student at Stern Business School, but dropped out about three years ago.
good job. Keep me posted. - Will do.
it's pretty risky business, huh, boss?
you can say that again. And then there's Al and Carrie to worry about.
all right.
whoa. There's cold and then there's you.
how many 15's can they give me?
book says to hit against a face.
I keep telling you, I play my gut. Yes and the casino really appreciates that.
that's 20 for you, Sir. - Ah, there we go.
all right. - Yeah.
I'm gonna double down. - Showoff.
good luck.
21. Again. - Must be my lucky night.
all right.
you know what, let-let's take a little break. That's a good idea.
so, you're the redheaded card counter I've heard rumors about.
card counter? Are you crazy?
who could possibly count against, what, four decks? You'd be the first I've seen.
time to move on from blackjack, Sydney.
Ah, you really want to cut her off before she gives it all back?
Mr. Newman, we're happy to have you continue playing.
Yeah. Sydney?
I have a seat ready for you at the poker table.
well, she still has poker privileges, right?
of course. Behave, Charlie.
good luck.
luck.
who said anything about luck?
my lady knows her way around a casino,
Mr. uh...
I sense we're not the first she's taken a bundle off of.
so that's one of the reasons we're here tonight.
she took a guy big couple weeks ago at another room in town.
hoping to get another shot at him. Goes by "Marty." You know him?
I'm not too good with names... Charlie.
trying to buy a pot off me again?
I'm out.
wise move, sweet cheeks.
thank you, Carrie.
who... are... you?
hurry up, guy. Move on me or tuck your tail.
fine, Germ.
I'm all-in.
two pair... aces and jacks.
flush wins.
I'm cleaned out.
Mr. Zager would like to speak to you on the telephone.
this way.
thank U
thank you very much. Thank you very much.
she's good. Oh, the kid's good.
Ah, look who's back.
with a nice marker for the rest of us to win.
men's room's on the other side of the floor.
I need a marker. Like the one you gave that guy over there.
only Mr. Zager approves markers.
I just dropped a European sports car on your tables, least they can do is give me a chance to win it back.
thank you for your trouble.
Hey, Murray, I got a favor to ask.
I need your Bureau buddies to run a name for me.
I only got a last name "Zager," but it seems like he's the juice behind the casino.
all right, I'm on it.
we can't float you anything at this time.
Mr. Zager only offers markers to those he knows.
please enjoy a cocktail on the house. So kind of you.
fine, Germ. I'm all-in.
two pair... aces and jacks.
you're awful anxious for someone who's not in the game.
hmm. You got a big mouth.
I mean... it's pretty but... it's big.
apparently, you've been paying more attention to my mouth than you have to your cards, which is why I've been carding you up.
all-in.
call.
straight don't beat a boat.
I busted you again, Donkey.
you... certainly...
got his number... don't you?
run away while you're ahead? That's real classy.
you know what I call it? Real smart.
Hi, Charlie. The guy must've lost 80 grand.
Yeah. Like Standley. He never had a chance.
the whole game is fixed. I'm cashing out.
so, I know Carrie thinks the poker game is rigged, but... what's the guy's signal?
the cards or the player they're targeting. Someone was spotting his cards behind the table.
all right, but then how did Carrie take Germ down?
nobody was spotting her cards, he had no advantage.
pretty ballsy move... two guys running a card scam in front of Dean.
which is why we think they work for the casino. They're targeting individuals and bleeding 'em.
What'd you find?
sunglasses guy is Kirby Monroe. Got a couple charges for robbery.
seems to work card rooms around the East Coast.
and Germ?
this is an interesting fellow, Chuck Thornton.
got a perfect score on his LSAT's, Columbia Law School, but this guy's a two-time loser.
got pinched for falsifying pick-six bets from the Breeder's Cup back in 2006;
served 37 months.
Hey, guys. A buddy of mine at the Bureau just sent this over on the money guy Zager.
now, the name Zager showed up in the gambling scene a few years ago, but nobody's got anything on him. Not even a country of origin.
what about the guy they cleaned out... Olden?
Yes. Will Olden, 32, lawyer, lives in Park Slope.
made about $150 K last year. His only client is the estate of a dead guy.
here's what I got on the estate. Okay, so,
olden loses almost an entire year's salary at the poker table last night.
why extend a marker to a guy who can't pay it back?
it doesn't make sense. It does to someone.
how is it we both stayed up all night and you look amazing and I look like hell?
practice. And genetics.
in terms of Eliot's money, were we up for the night?
we? You do know blackjack is played to 21, right?
thank you. And all night I thought it was 15.
so we looked into this guy Olden...
coffee? - Sure.
who lost big at poker.
strange thing is he's a small-time lawyer without deep pockets, and still they gave him this big marker.
same profile as Standley.
maybe they set him up, too.
well, why fix games against people who borrow money from you who can't pay you back?
no good, huh? - Mm-mm.
what does the guy do for a living?
represents the estate of some dead guy who owned run-down buildings in Red Hook.
Donald Trump, he isn't.
look, it's city politics. Of course there was disagreements, but everyone loved working with Scott.
he was fair and people respected that.
I may have something.
Standley was working on the subway expansion project in Red Hook, deciding on stops.
I saw the map in his office.
he was choosing between Wolcott Street and Carroll Street.
the property near the new subway stop will suddenly become a gold mine.
Jay, where are the buildings that Olden represented in Red Hook?
uh, hold on a sec.
okay, here we go... Olden's client's biggest property was an abandoned warehouse on Wolcott Street.
that's the play.
they weren't looking to get paid back in money.
they wanted Standley to rule in their favor on the subway expansion.
which, if they own the right property, is a hell of a lot more valuable than any gambling debt.
I don't know, that seems like an awful lot of work.
why not just bribe the guy?
Standley's assistant said he was incorruptible.
but once the casino got their hooks into him, he had no choice.
the assistant was right.
Standley's not corrupt, he's a gambling addict, right?
so they lure him in, and then once they get him in debt, they use their leverage to make him choose Wolcott Street.
but then why kill the guy before he's made his decision?
he had made a decision. I saw it circled on the map in his office.
he chose Carroll Street.
so he decides to go with his conscience, even if it means screwing the Foxriver guys.
so they kill him, but they still go forward trying to acquire Olden's property.
they must think they can get Standley's replacement to go their way.
right. They bet on Wolcott.
Jay, look into the local holdings of Foxriver Group.
okay.
okay, we got two properties, both purchased within the last three weeks.
both buildings on Wolcott Street.
okay, can you find any names on these property deals?
just the one:
uh, just because you think you know why Standley was murdered, doesn't mean we can prove it.
if we go marching in there without the complete picture, we could easily jeopardize our murder investigation.
if we can get to someone on the inside, we can go after Dean and his crew for extortion and racketeering... squeeze 'em on the Standley murder.
I think I know someone at the casino who can help us.
Molly. Hey, Charlie.
funny running into you.
we need to talk. In private.
look, Charlie, I know that you're upset about Mr. Zager not extending you a marker, but this is really inappropriate.
I can't believe I let cops into the club.
do you know what will happen to me if-if-if we get raided?
I'm interested in things far more serious than a card game, okay?
how long you been working with Dean and the others? A few years.
I-I started playing cards in business school af-after some personal stuff.
I was good. I won.
for a while, anyway. That why you dropped out of school?
I was tapped out. But Dean offered me a deal and I took it.
they waived my debt in exchange for running the floor for them.
I tried leaving a few months back.
they wouldn't let me go. Who's "they"?
Dean, Zager, anybody else? Maybe a silent partner?
germ. One of the poker players.
Zager come up with the plan?
there's no Zager.
Dean and Germ invented him as a cover... well, really it-it was Germ.
he's terrified of going to jail again.
so he invented a phantom boss.
my God, I am dead if they find out that I ratted...
listen to me.
we can protect you. We can work with the DA. We can get it in writing.
if you help us take down your bosses, I can make sure that you walk.
you don't get it. These guys are wired.
we've never been raided.
and I'm pretty sure it's because they've got vice cops on their payroll.
you recognize him?
Yeah, sure. That's Marty.
have Dean and Germ been extending him credit? He owes them big.
I'm looking for other people like Marty who are in the hole to your bosses.
you keep records of that? I have a ledger.
but, I mean, Dean has control over it when I leave.
there's some file in the back he has locked up.
if you want your life back, I'm gonna need your help.
I want my life back.
okay, so the ledger will give us the names of the other extortion and racketeering victims, and then we use our leverage to find out who killed Standley.
but how are you gonna get that ledger out of there?
the plan is Carrie and I show up like we did last night, but Molly greets us before security pats us down.
we escort her out with the ledger, then we signal ESU to move on the casino.
that's a lot of working parts, Burns. It's the only way to bring them down.
Molly's just getting to work right now. I don't want to leave her hanging for too long.
she's in a dangerous corner. We gotta move.
Hey...Remember that burner cell that Standley called the night he was killed?
I just tracked a call from it to the switchboard at Police Plaza.
the call could be to vice. Germ and Dean might already know we've been inside.
you gotta move now.
all right. All right.
no bouncer.
something feels off.
something tells me your gut's right this time.
what the hell is going on?
they knew we were coming. Maybe they were tipped by vice.
Aah! Help!
help! They're in there! - No, no!
this way, this way! Get down! Get down! Get down behind me!
germ shot Dean. They were fighting over the money.
I was next!
he's going for the back exit! - Get out of here! Go! Go!
go! - Okay!
our victim is Scott Standley, Zoning Board Commissioner.
no sign of forced entry.
I need a marker. Like the one you gave that guy over there.
only Mr. Zager approves markers.
we can't float you anything at this time.
okay, listen, it's Molly.
she's running the whole thing.
go get her. I got this.
you got this? Really? - All right, fine.
you're not getting out of here, Germ.
I'm not going back to prison either.
okay. Go. - Okay.
let's go!
all RIGHT, MOVE IN - Everybody out! - Out! Let's go!
quickly! Move!
all right, we're clear. Move in!
no, no, no, no, no.
this way.
step inside and state your name.
gotcha.
drop it! Hands on the wheel.
nice bluff, Molly. You almost had us.
but we own your ass now.
you got here fast. Yeah, I move all right.
just talked with Ballistics. The gun in Molly's purse matches to Standley's murder.
she killed him 'cause she couldn't blackmail him. And Germ's been spilling to Murray.
turns out he lost his ass to Molly three years ago.
rather than offing him like she did Standley, she concocted this scheme to have him and Dean front as the boss.
and the call she made to Police Plaza was just to divert suspicion from herself.
She-she was a smart, shrewd lady.
she was seconds away from disappearing forever.
Well-played, team. Really. Well-played.
now there's just the, uh, matter of my money.
what money?
does it ever get old, Wells?
no.
fine.
here's your money. All of it is there. Every penny.
you don't have to count it. You can trust me.
????? Oh. All those hours gambling and yet you return the exact amount I gave you.
now... what are the odds of that?
uh, you said, "I want all of it returned. Every penny.
and I kept my end of the bargain.
you should be happy. Fine.
I will take my little win and I will fold.
you have to know, I can only protect you so far with this stuff.
I know. Thank you.
but there will come a time.
should I even ask what you're gonna do with the money you won?
you can't keep it. - All right.
how 'bout a little wager?
arm wrestle. You win, the money goes to charity;
I win, hello, Puerto Rico.
this is you not gambling? You can't help yourself.
one last bet. Come on.
let's go. You're just scared.
yeah? All right. - I'm very, very strong.
I don't just have a super memory... - You... are going down.
I'll send you a postcard from the beach.
count of three? Yep.
this is quite strange. Are we gonna, um...
wrestle or-or hold hands all night?
call it a draw?
you win. Money goes to charity.
Oh, the game was fixed.
I just wanted you to see how good it feels to win.
can the winner buy you a drink?
always.
let's go, Charlie.
it is our civic duty to mold New York into a city that matches our highest aspirations.
and your thoughtful and passionate contribution to that effort only strengthens my commitment.
thank you.
and then I'll announce my decision and any clapping will be drowned out by the boos.
the right decision isn't always the most popular one, Scott. I hope I didn't teach you that.
earliest night you've knocked off this week. Where am I taking you?
home, Larry.
good night, Suzy.
commissioner? It's me, Larry.
we have that announcement this morning. I'm here to pick you up.
Mr. Standley!
Varick! Hey, Varick, come back here!
you thought you could get away from me.
Hey, it's Super Memory Woman!
okay. Hello!
Oh, no, no.
you're gonna have to do a lot better than that. Okay, now!
tricky, tricky.
are you ready for this?
here we go. - Yep.
and... I'm...
Lulu! Are you a witch?
that would depend on who you ask.
my phone's ringing. Go play, you guys. Have fun.
you're nuts running on a day like this. Ever heard of heat stroke?
I barely got started running before you called me and I'm trying to beat my 10K record.
proving what, exactly?
proving that I'm better now than I was in 1993.
just competing against yourself. Yeah, well, you got to beat the best to be the best.
all right, our victim is Scott Standley, Zoning Board Commissioner.
that's a powerful position. Yet I never heard of him.
you have anything on him in that head of yours?
no. I'm drawing a total blank.
see? Running in this heat's melting your brain.
I don't know...
Standley's aide, Larry Borman, discovered the body about 8: 30 a. m.
he got in using a key Standley had given him.
no sign of forced entry. I'm thinking our victim let his killer in.
all right.
cleared the aide?
Ah, claims he was with his girlfriend on 21st Street all night.
murray's looking into it.
looks like two shots to the chest; used a pillow to muffle the sound.
5, 000-piece puzzle.
learning Portuguese.
I don't know, the... puzzle, the cat, learning a new language...
seems like a lonely guy looking for a distraction.
I know you're all wondering if I hit my trips, boys, but...
you're gonna have to pay to find out.
something?
no. Nothing.
so, the aide's alibi holds up. Girlfriend and the doorman confirm his story.
you track Standley's movements yesterday?
he went in to the office at 8: 00 in the morning, worked late with his staff, went home.
they say he seemed upset, worried about anything? Not anything out of the ordinary.
his wife just passed from cancer ten months ago, so he'd been pretty down.
I didn't see any cameras in the lobby of Standley's building.
what about out on his street? - Nothing.
but I'm all over his cell records. Maybe we'll get lucky.
Jay! What do you got?
got a bio on the guy, not much else.
meet Scott Standley, 42, Zoning Board Commissioner for New York City.
served under the last four mayors in some capacity.
before he worked for the city, he ran a non-profit for underprivileged kids.
violent end for a do-gooder, no?
I did look into some of Standley's recent work decisions.
just last week, he approved this community park up in the Bronx.
grass for the community, playgrounds for the kids... but yes, $20 million in billings to the contractor who won the bid.
so, a guy creates a windfall for winning bidders and bad feelings for those he passes on.
big money, big motive.
okay. Standley made three personal phone calls yesterday on his cell phone, all to the same number...
a burner cell. I'm trying to track it.
why is a successful political like this guy living in a tiny apartment and making calls to burner cells?
it doesn't track.
I mean, get into his finances, check his emails, threats, disgruntled colleagues, anything.
how's it coming?
fine. Um... I think everything's pretty straightforward.
I'll put the time of death at about 1: 00 a. m. I sent you the report.
Yeah, no, I-I got it, I just, uh...
you know, I was just wondering if there was anything else that maybe, you know...
is everything all right? Can't a person just drop by anymore?
a person can, but you can't.
okay. The truth is...
I need your advice.
Oh, it's about the Secret Service guy.
you've been dating a few months, he's throwing around the "E" word.
well, honestly, if you ask me, exclusivity is overrated.
I was dating a guy, he was a trustee at the children's zoo and he said, "Baboons have it down.
the females just go out and expose their tushes to the troops - and the troops bow down and applaud... -" No. No. Jo. Jo.
my issue isn't the Secret Service guy.
m-my issue is that I, uh...
I knew our victim. You knew him?
Yeah. - How?
well, I met him about four months ago, he said his name was Marty.
I didn't sleep with him.
um, we were engaged in...
a GAME of chance.
you're gambling. I thought you stopped.
I did. But I started again.
and anyway, you know, we didn't really talk or anything.
I mean, he just sat across the poker table from me and...
have you told Al? - No.
no. I needed your advice first. What do I do?
really, we don't know if that has anything to do with the investigation.
exactly... and so why would I go and tell Al and get him mad...?
no, but it might. My advice would be to run with it.
the killer's out there, suppose he kills again?
right. So I should definitely tell Al, then, right?
so, this guy Standley was basically Mr. Clean.
murray's going over his phone records, online history... but there's nothing.
he wasn't dating anybody. No evidence of drug use.
are you even listening to me? I met Standley gambling...
at a card room on the Upper West Side about four months ago.
I recognized him when I saw his dead body.
you were playing poker? - Yes.
and I know I told you I would quit and I did, I did for a while.
for a while? Are you forgetting what it took to cover your ass last time - In Chinatown? - No. I know.
if Tom Stoddard hadn't owed me a favor... - I appreciate that!
Oh, well, not enough that you would stop doing it.
it's because I'm weak and reckless. - Selfish.
and selfish. - Stupid.
self-destructive. - I'm not stupid.
Yeah, stupid. And you're my partner.
you're compromising an investigation.
I know. And I have put you in an impossible situation and I'm gonna fix it.
I'm gonna fix it because I'm gonna talk to Eliot, okay?
he's gonna go ballistic.
I know. - It's gonna be the last conversation you ever have with him.
Yeah, I know. - Okay. I'll go with you.
no. I don't want to compromise you any more than I already have. I'm gonna go on my own,
I'm a big girl, I'm just gonna... face the music.
what are you gonna say?
all right. Okay. Here it is.
Scott Standley was gambling in underground casinos.
okay. You believe...
this is connected to why he was murdered?
I'm not sure.
okay, why do I have the odd feeling that there's something more?
well, I know this...
well, because I remember him from one of the casinos.
one of those... casinos that you, yourself...were gambling at?
Yes. - I see.
what exactly do you expect me to do with this information?
I, I thought you should know. You... thought I should know...
that one of my detectives, a New York City police officer, working in the Major Crimes Bureau, an officer sworn to uphold the law...
was committing a felony?
here it is THE THING, w-we need to investigate gambling as a lead and I thought you should know the basis...
of that investigation... - Thank you.
you can go now.
so, you don't have anymore questions for me about, you know, maybe how often I gamble?
if it's maybe, a problem for me? Do I win much?
I most certainly do not have any more questions like that. - Because I always win...
I do, however, have one question, which I will ask again:
will you please leave my office? Sure.
are you mad?
I'm not...
okay.
Hey, Al...
commissioner Standley's bank records.
now, this guy's been draining his accounts over the last nine months.
downsized apartments from the Upper West Side to Alphabet City.
if he was corrupt, he sure as hell wasn't too good at it.
he made some pretty huge withdrawals, too. Look, $3, 000 on one day, $5, 000 on another.
what's he doing with that cash? Loneliness can be a gateway to all sorts of vices.
if we find out where his money was going, I bet we find out why he was killed.
Hey. It turns out Standley had a sizeable life insurance policy from the city... and get this:
he changed his beneficiary three weeks ago.
who's getting the money? Standley's assistant...
lonely widower makes his beautiful assistant his beneficiary and three weeks later, he's killed.
well, maybe Suzy got tired of answering the phones.
it's crazy. We were all just here.
I feel like he's gonna walk right through that door.
there was no one he was particularly at odds with?
nothing he was working on recently that went south?
look, it's city politics, of course there was disagreements, but people loved working with Scott.
he was fair and people respected that.
did he change at all, after his wife died? Did his behavior become more erratic?
no. Nothing like that. Um... he worked more after Colleen died.
and do you think he used his influence for personal profit?
no. No way.
a company lobbying to build a factory in Queens sent over a bouquet after his wife's funeral and...
and he made me send it back. He was incorruptible.
that would strike me as odd, that he would make you his life insurance beneficiary three weeks before he was killed.
what are you talking about? You didn't know?
all $200, 000 is yours.
no. I... I know that he doesn't have a family, but that's incredibly weird. He didn't say a word.
maybe the lonely widower was starting to look at you in a more personal way.
al... He was more like a brother.
you two spent a lot of time together, feelings build... - AL
do you know where he went when he wasn't working?
Larry would know. Larry Borman, his aide.
they spent a lot more time outside of the office.
excuse me. - Sure.
why'd you step on my affair angle? I was getting signals from her.
you were getting signals from her? Really?
were you also getting signals from her wife?
Yeah.
sure, I picked him up in the mornings sometimes.
took him to meetings. Once in a while, I'd drive him home.
you ever drive him anywhere else? No, not really.
you know, he lived a pretty simple life.
after Colleen died, he'd pretty much been keeping to himself.
Yeah. I understand that. After my husband passed, I kept to myself, too.
sometimes you get lonely. You need something to fill that void.
I know I did. I did some things I wasn't too proud of.
you see any of that behavior in Mr. Standley?
Hey, look, it wasn't a big deal, but in the last couple of months before he died, he started having me take him to bars.
Larry, was there one bar in particular you took him to?
Yeah. Lonnegan's on the Lower East Side.
he started having me drop him there a couple months ago.
okay. When was the last time you took him to Lonnegan's?
two nights ago.
all the bars in New York, and this is where Standley came to unwind?
Yeah, well, you forgot your skinny jeans and your moustache.
is drinking beer out of a can a thing again?
haven't seen that since Cavanaugh's, back in Syracuse.
tuesday night PBRs led to an epic game of truth or dare.
you won.
turned out we could sneak into the ladies' room and go undetected.
I think we both won. For 11 mind-blowing minutes.
I thought it was longer.
our victim was Scott Standley, Zoning Board Commissioner.
no sign of forced entry... Interesting.
okay, listen, I just saw a guy who used a pocket watch to gain access to the back room.
now Standley had the exact same watch in his apartment.
he wasn't coming here to drink. You think there's a casino in there?
Yeah, I do. And he was here the night before he was killed.
I gotta get in there.
don't even think about it. - Why?!
we-we could go in and check things out from the inside.
we can't just go inand shut it down, 'cause we're not gonna learn anything that way.
you really think Eliot's gonna let you go undercover at an underground casino?
sure. Of course. It's a brilliant idea.
how could he say no?
no.
look, we tracked Standley to an underground casino. The same one you saw him in?
one I haven't been to. - Oh, imagine that.
his aide confirmed he was there the night before he was murdered.
now I've been digging around and I've got some contacts who say Standley was asking for a big loan.
he was asking loan sharks for $180, 000.
so, we're thinking either he lost money gambling, took out a big loan and he couldn't repay it, or he pissed off the wrong guy at the card table.
so we go undercover at the casino... we find the killer.
right... Well, I mean, in order for that to really work, my God, a person would have to have built up a lot of cred...
gambling at... - Oh.
such establishments. That's a year ago.
the Chanel is a little out of style, but I do think, I do think you'd pull it off.
Oh, thank you very much.
how did you get...? - You don't really think
I was gonna hire you two without doing my research, did you?
this one, oh, look, four months ago. That's the warehouse down on Grover.
Yeah, it's Fulton, actually, and I am very flattered that you've been spying on me.
relax, Wells.
I'm just keeping tabs on my dream team. What do you have on Al?
al? Uh... you know, well, four unpaid parking tickets outside the same curry house in Astoria.
and I seem to recall an unlicensed woodworking class in Dumbo.
yawn. Life in the fast lane, huh?
I made a magazine rack. Mahogany.
I trust...
that you understand the blowback that could come down on this unit if others from City Hall or the department find out about your little habit?
you found out about my little habit and you haven't fired me yet, why?
Really? I mean, would you fire you?
no.
you're going undercover.
Yes! Both of you.
Oh, look at that.
here's THE DEAL if I win again, I don't have to wear this necklace.
Carrie, if you don't wear the necklace camera, we can't see what's happening inside the casino.
Jay, if I do wear the necklace camera,
I run the risk of looking like a real housewife of Beverly Hills.
this thing is huge.
I bought a necklace just like that a few years ago, for my sister, - and she loved it. - Ah, that's very, very cute that you still believe that. Hey.
murray got a tip on this loan shark. - Mm!
Dean Gray from West Orange. Multiple arrests and he may be working inside this casino.
all right, are you ready?
three of diamonds, jack of spades, four of hearts, ten of clubs, seven of spades.
damn. I've seen her use her friggin' memory a million times and she still hustles me.
okay.
now...
now with both of you wearing your cameras, we'll be able to see what you're doing,
I. D. whoever's inside the casino, all right?
and you... are gonna teach me how to do this one day.
over a beer. - Fair enough. I'll buy.
all right. - Good luck, guys.
listen, got us into the casino, we're all good.
I had my bookie Zeke vouch for us.
you got a bookie named Zeke who vouches for you?
Yeah. I told him you were my new sugar daddy, so you should start practicing your part.
who's your old sugar daddy?
wouldn't you like to know. - Yeah.
let me ask you, do you moonlight as a gambler or as a cop? I am not... a gambler.
gamblers lose, I win.
Ooh, nice "murse," Eliot.
you want to pass as a high roller, you have to bet like a high roller.
no catnip for Kitty. You're the bank.
huh. Put the responsible one in charge... that's smart.
wait a second, I'm the one playing at the big table.
precisely, if you have a cold night, I can trust Al not to lose all that cash.
I can't even tell you what I did for the commissioner for him to okay this.
we won't ask, you don't tell.
the cash comes back... every penny of it.
Oh, yeah, and um... it'd also be nice if you found Standley's killer.
they're heading in.
Hey. How you doing?
this way.
step inside. State your name.
Oh, thank you.
a photo booth! Hmm!
well, this is cool.
come on. - All right.
here we go.
smile, Charlie.
good evening.
nice place. Yeah... I can see the allure.
okay. Roulette for you, red and black... you can handle that.
sydney, Charlie, I'm Molly, your hostess.
Zeke tells me your lady's quite a player, Charlie. She does okay.
well, this is quite something.
I mean, I've been in a lot of card rooms, but never one like this.
I think you'll see, we cater to a higher-end player than the other rooms in town.
we offer all the games:
blackjack, craps, roulette and of course, poker.
sydney, I already placed you on the wait-list for the high-stakes table.
thank you. How is the action tonight? - Mmm, some loose players, some tight.
you might have your hands full. I think I'll manage.
she's trying to work on her confidence.
well, I aim to pamper our VIPs, so please let me know if there's anything I can do for you.
thank you. She's perky.
keep it in your holster, Charlie.
sir.
all right, here we go. My pleasure.
thank you.
tonight's gonna be fun.
I'm gonna win. Okay.
no... you gotta earn your allowance with me, Sydney.
I give you money in exchange for some sugar. That's how these relationships work.
you owe me back pay...
daddy.
daddy." Really?
how they doing?
boss, I've got facial recognition working overtime.
this place is not lacking in suspects. Most of the security guards have sheets.
well, it takes a criminal to run a criminal operation.
now, Carrie's got to watch out for this guy when she sits down at the poker table.
alexander Sapic. Serbian mobster.
suspected of dismembering a guy after he took him for big cash in Monte Carlo.
charming guy. Who's that Al's taken an interest in?
Oh, that's... Molly McGintee. I think she's the hostess or something.
smart kid.
was a student at Stern Business School, but dropped out about three years ago.
good job. Keep me posted. - Will do.
it's pretty risky business, huh, boss?
you can say that again. And then there's Al and Carrie to worry about.
all right.
whoa. There's cold and then there's you.
how many 15's can they give me?
book says to hit against a face.
I keep telling you, I play my gut. Yes and the casino really appreciates that.
that's 20 for you, Sir. - Ah, there we go.
all right. - Yeah.
I'm gonna double down. - Showoff.
good luck.
21. Again. - Must be my lucky night.
all right.
you know what, let-let's take a little break. That's a good idea.
so, you're the redheaded card counter I've heard rumors about.
card counter? Are you crazy?
who could possibly count against, what, four decks? You'd be the first I've seen.
time to move on from blackjack, Sydney.
Ah, you really want to cut her off before she gives it all back?
Mr. Newman, we're happy to have you continue playing.
Yeah. Sydney?
I have a seat ready for you at the poker table.
well, she still has poker privileges, right?
of course. Behave, Charlie.
good luck.
luck.
who said anything about luck?
my lady knows her way around a casino,
Mr. uh...
I sense we're not the first she's taken a bundle off of.
so that's one of the reasons we're here tonight.
she took a guy big couple weeks ago at another room in town.
hoping to get another shot at him. Goes by "Marty." You know him?
I'm not too good with names... Charlie.
trying to buy a pot off me again?
I'm out.
wise move, sweet cheeks.
thank you, Carrie.
who... are... you?
hurry up, guy. Move on me or tuck your tail.
fine, Germ.
I'm all-in.
two pair... aces and jacks.
flush wins.
I'm cleaned out.
Mr. Zager would like to speak to you on the telephone.
this way.
thank U
thank you very much. Thank you very much.
she's good. Oh, the kid's good.
Ah, look who's back.
with a nice marker for the rest of us to win.
men's room's on the other side of the floor.
I need a marker. Like the one you gave that guy over there.
only Mr. Zager approves markers.
I just dropped a European sports car on your tables, least they can do is give me a chance to win it back.
thank you for your trouble.
Hey, Murray, I got a favor to ask.
I need your Bureau buddies to run a name for me.
I only got a last name "Zager," but it seems like he's the juice behind the casino.
all right, I'm on it.
we can't float you anything at this time.
Mr. Zager only offers markers to those he knows.
please enjoy a cocktail on the house. So kind of you.
fine, Germ. I'm all-in.
two pair... aces and jacks.
you're awful anxious for someone who's not in the game.
hmm. You got a big mouth.
I mean... it's pretty but... it's big.
apparently, you've been paying more attention to my mouth than you have to your cards, which is why I've been carding you up.
all-in.
call.
straight don't beat a boat.
I busted you again, Donkey.
you... certainly...
got his number... don't you?
run away while you're ahead? That's real classy.
you know what I call it? Real smart.
Hi, Charlie. The guy must've lost 80 grand.
Yeah. Like Standley. He never had a chance.
the whole game is fixed. I'm cashing out.
so, I know Carrie thinks the poker game is rigged, but... what's the guy's signal?
the cards or the player they're targeting. Someone was spotting his cards behind the table.
all right, but then how did Carrie take Germ down?
nobody was spotting her cards, he had no advantage.
pretty ballsy move... two guys running a card scam in front of Dean.
which is why we think they work for the casino. They're targeting individuals and bleeding 'em.
What'd you find?
sunglasses guy is Kirby Monroe. Got a couple charges for robbery.
seems to work card rooms around the East Coast.
and Germ?
this is an interesting fellow, Chuck Thornton.
got a perfect score on his LSAT's, Columbia Law School, but this guy's a two-time loser.
got pinched for falsifying pick-six bets from the Breeder's Cup back in 2006;
served 37 months.
Hey, guys. A buddy of mine at the Bureau just sent this over on the money guy Zager.
now, the name Zager showed up in the gambling scene a few years ago, but nobody's got anything on him. Not even a country of origin.
what about the guy they cleaned out... Olden?
Yes. Will Olden, 32, lawyer, lives in Park Slope.
made about $150 K last year. His only client is the estate of a dead guy.
here's what I got on the estate. Okay, so,
olden loses almost an entire year's salary at the poker table last night.
why extend a marker to a guy who can't pay it back?
it doesn't make sense. It does to someone.
how is it we both stayed up all night and you look amazing and I look like hell?
practice. And genetics.
in terms of Eliot's money, were we up for the night?
we? You do know blackjack is played to 21, right?
thank you. And all night I thought it was 15.
so we looked into this guy Olden...
coffee? - Sure.
who lost big at poker.
strange thing is he's a small-time lawyer without deep pockets, and still they gave him this big marker.
same profile as Standley.
maybe they set him up, too.
well, why fix games against people who borrow money from you who can't pay you back?
no good, huh? - Mm-mm.
what does the guy do for a living?
represents the estate of some dead guy who owned run-down buildings in Red Hook.
Donald Trump, he isn't.
look, it's city politics. Of course there was disagreements, but everyone loved working with Scott.
he was fair and people respected that.
I may have something.
Standley was working on the subway expansion project in Red Hook, deciding on stops.
I saw the map in his office.
he was choosing between Wolcott Street and Carroll Street.
the property near the new subway stop will suddenly become a gold mine.
Jay, where are the buildings that Olden represented in Red Hook?
uh, hold on a sec.
okay, here we go... Olden's client's biggest property was an abandoned warehouse on Wolcott Street.
that's the play.
they weren't looking to get paid back in money.
they wanted Standley to rule in their favor on the subway expansion.
which, if they own the right property, is a hell of a lot more valuable than any gambling debt.
I don't know, that seems like an awful lot of work.
why not just bribe the guy?
Standley's assistant said he was incorruptible.
but once the casino got their hooks into him, he had no choice.
the assistant was right.
Standley's not corrupt, he's a gambling addict, right?
so they lure him in, and then once they get him in debt, they use their leverage to make him choose Wolcott Street.
but then why kill the guy before he's made his decision?
he had made a decision. I saw it circled on the map in his office.
he chose Carroll Street.
so he decides to go with his conscience, even if it means screwing the Foxriver guys.
so they kill him, but they still go forward trying to acquire Olden's property.
they must think they can get Standley's replacement to go their way.
right. They bet on Wolcott.
Jay, look into the local holdings of Foxriver Group.
okay.
okay, we got two properties, both purchased within the last three weeks.
both buildings on Wolcott Street.
okay, can you find any names on these property deals?
just the one:
uh, just because you think you know why Standley was murdered, doesn't mean we can prove it.
if we go marching in there without the complete picture, we could easily jeopardize our murder investigation.
if we can get to someone on the inside, we can go after Dean and his crew for extortion and racketeering... squeeze 'em on the Standley murder.
I think I know someone at the casino who can help us.
Molly. Hey, Charlie.
funny running into you.
we need to talk. In private.
look, Charlie, I know that you're upset about Mr. Zager not extending you a marker, but this is really inappropriate.
I can't believe I let cops into the club.
do you know what will happen to me if-if-if we get raided?
I'm interested in things far more serious than a card game, okay?
how long you been working with Dean and the others? A few years.
I-I started playing cards in business school af-after some personal stuff.
I was good. I won.
for a while, anyway. That why you dropped out of school?
I was tapped out. But Dean offered me a deal and I took it.
they waived my debt in exchange for running the floor for them.
I tried leaving a few months back.
they wouldn't let me go. Who's "they"?
Dean, Zager, anybody else? Maybe a silent partner?
germ. One of the poker players.
Zager come up with the plan?
there's no Zager.
Dean and Germ invented him as a cover... well, really it-it was Germ.
he's terrified of going to jail again.
so he invented a phantom boss.
my God, I am dead if they find out that I ratted...
listen to me.
we can protect you. We can work with the DA. We can get it in writing.
if you help us take down your bosses, I can make sure that you walk.
you don't get it. These guys are wired.
we've never been raided.
and I'm pretty sure it's because they've got vice cops on their payroll.
you recognize him?
Yeah, sure. That's Marty.
have Dean and Germ been extending him credit? He owes them big.
I'm looking for other people like Marty who are in the hole to your bosses.
you keep records of that? I have a ledger.
but, I mean, Dean has control over it when I leave.
there's some file in the back he has locked up.
if you want your life back, I'm gonna need your help.
I want my life back.
okay, so the ledger will give us the names of the other extortion and racketeering victims, and then we use our leverage to find out who killed Standley.
but how are you gonna get that ledger out of there?
the plan is Carrie and I show up like we did last night, but Molly greets us before security pats us down.
we escort her out with the ledger, then we signal ESU to move on the casino.
that's a lot of working parts, Burns. It's the only way to bring them down.
Molly's just getting to work right now. I don't want to leave her hanging for too long.
she's in a dangerous corner. We gotta move.
Hey...Remember that burner cell that Standley called the night he was killed?
I just tracked a call from it to the switchboard at Police Plaza.
the call could be to vice. Germ and Dean might already know we've been inside.
you gotta move now.
all right. All right.
no bouncer.
something feels off.
something tells me your gut's right this time.
what the hell is going on?
they knew we were coming. Maybe they were tipped by vice.
Aah! Help!
help! They're in there! - No, no!
this way, this way! Get down! Get down! Get down behind me!
germ shot Dean. They were fighting over the money.
I was next!
he's going for the back exit! - Get out of here! Go! Go!
go! - Okay!
our victim is Scott Standley, Zoning Board Commissioner.
no sign of forced entry.
I need a marker. Like the one you gave that guy over there.
only Mr. Zager approves markers.
we can't float you anything at this time.
okay, listen, it's Molly.
she's running the whole thing.
go get her. I got this.
you got this? Really? - All right, fine.
you're not getting out of here, Germ.
I'm not going back to prison either.
okay. Go. - Okay.
let's go!
all RIGHT, MOVE IN - Everybody out! - Out! Let's go!
quickly! Move!
all right, we're clear. Move in!
no, no, no, no, no.
this way.
step inside and state your name.
gotcha.
drop it! Hands on the wheel.
nice bluff, Molly. You almost had us.
but we own your ass now.
you got here fast. Yeah, I move all right.
just talked with Ballistics. The gun in Molly's purse matches to Standley's murder.
she killed him 'cause she couldn't blackmail him. And Germ's been spilling to Murray.
turns out he lost his ass to Molly three years ago.
rather than offing him like she did Standley, she concocted this scheme to have him and Dean front as the boss.
and the call she made to Police Plaza was just to divert suspicion from herself.
She-she was a smart, shrewd lady.
she was seconds away from disappearing forever.
Well-played, team. Really. Well-played.
now there's just the, uh, matter of my money.
what money?
does it ever get old, Wells?
no.
fine.
here's your money. All of it is there. Every penny.
you don't have to count it. You can trust me.
????? Oh. All those hours gambling and yet you return the exact amount I gave you.
now... what are the odds of that?
uh, you said, "I want all of it returned. Every penny.
and I kept my end of the bargain.
you should be happy. Fine.
I will take my little win and I will fold.
you have to know, I can only protect you so far with this stuff.
I know. Thank you.
but there will come a time.
should I even ask what you're gonna do with the money you won?
you can't keep it. - All right.
how 'bout a little wager?
arm wrestle. You win, the money goes to charity;
I win, hello, Puerto Rico.
this is you not gambling? You can't help yourself.
one last bet. Come on.
let's go. You're just scared.
yeah? All right. - I'm very, very strong.
I don't just have a super memory... - You... are going down.
I'll send you a postcard from the beach.
count of three? Yep.
this is quite strange. Are we gonna, um...
wrestle or-or hold hands all night?
call it a draw?
you win. Money goes to charity.
Oh, the game was fixed.
I just wanted you to see how good it feels to win.
can the winner buy you a drink?
always.
let's go, Charlie.
stop playing with your collar. This new shirt is too tight...
I can't breathe.
can you fit your finger in there? - Yeah.
well, then, it's not too tight. What, did you memorize some Esquire article?
no. Six months, assistant floor manager at Tuxedo World, Albuquerque, 2007.
no way, come on.
view your tuxedo as an investment, that will guide you through formal events for years to come.
shall I go on? Name?
Carrie Wells, Al Burns. Right here.
great. Please fill out a name tag.
you got a pen? Uh... sorry.
someone must've grabbed it and run off. Oh, well, we're cops, we'll find them and arrest them.
Oh, you don't have to do that. I got it.
too cool for a name tag? - Yeah. I'm too cool for a name tag.
name tags are designed to make other people feel comfortable, so they can come up and talk to you.
I want everyone to feel really uncomfortable, so that they don't talk to me at all.
nice dress.
you know, you act like you don't like these charity things Eliot invites us to, but I think secretly, you love them.
you know what I love?
Ooh... are these little sandwichy things.
hmm. - Champagne?
Carrie, Al, I'm so glad you could make it.
I would like to introduce you to my wife Shelby. It is a pleasure to finally meet you.
likewise. Eliot's told me so much about you.
all good things, I hope. Glowing reviews.
really! - One of the many things I love about Shelby: discretion is a quality she holds in high regard.
well, not the only trait I've had to acquire being married for 15 years.
Shelby and Eliot. - There he is.
well, now the party can really begin.
lieutenant Al Burns. Detective Carrie Wells.
I'd like you to meet Manhattan Borough President Robert Bright.
well, it's an honor to have you. You're boss and I go way back.
Yeah, we were once called "young punks" in the mayor's office, back in the day.
wow, "punk" is not a word I would associate with Eliot.
I have pictures. Where's O'Bannon?
I haven't seen him.
Oh, my loyal Chief of Staff is already working the floor.
it's all hands on deck, till the primary. Bob's running for mayor.
Yeah, "For a Brighter future." Catchy.
couldn't resist it, right? Excuse me.
Bob... Debby Ellenson from the Times - Ah.
wants five minutes and they're gonna need you up on the dais pretty soon.
okay, thanks. So, uh, remind me to show you those photos later.
diamond stud, left ear. Won't you just go.
it was the '90s, all right? Aah, there's O'Bannon.
um, if you'll excuse me.
your husband can work a room, that's for sure.
Yes, he can.
it was a pleasure to meet you two.
the reviews really are glowing; I didn't just say that.
way to go, Eliot.
so, you got no one to talk to, O'Bannon?
it's good to see you, Eliot. It's been a while.
I know, I know. Hey, I'm-I'm sorry about, uh, lunch last month, - like, the office kind of blew up on me. - Yeah.
I get it. You're a busy man these days.
Yeah, yeah. You, too.
how's the campaign going? Is Bright totally insufferable yet?
it's, uh... Long hours, lots of handshakes.
he lives for it.
as many of you know, I'm Marcia Harrison, co-chair for today's event.
this organization means a great deal - You okay? - To the City of New York...
Yeah. I'm fine, just, uh...
just been thinking about some stuff.
you know what? I'll call you.
we'll catch up. Yeah, yeah, let's do that.
okay, enough from me.
it's my honor to introduce to you my co-chair for today's festivities,
Manhattan Borough President and currently a candidate for something, I hear...
Mr. Robert Bright.
thank you, Marcia and thank you, all, for being here.
listen, I'm not one to count my chickens before they hatch, but...
once they do hatch,
I do plan to ask them for their votes.
Oh, where is that champagne when you need it?
Oh! There you go. Thank you.
see? All done and plenty of daylight left. - Yes!
what do you want to do? - I don't know.
how about we go get some real food? Pretzel dog from Monte's?
a pret... really? Have you seen the way I'm dressed?
whoa. - Hold that thought.
folks, NYPD. Clear the way.
up STIARS - SOMEONE ?????
that's Dave O'Bannon.
okay, so, I found three wounds, two of them superficial:
one to the left hand, one to the wrist, probably defending himself.
the one on his neck slashed his carotid artery, probably would have bled out in minutes.
time of death? - It's preliminary, but the temperature would indicate maybe an hour ago.
that would place the murder around 3: 00 P. M. I'll know more when I get back to the lab.
how's he doing?
mostly on the phone with Dave's wife; arrangements and stuff.
the Three Amigos.
Dave, Eliot and Bright, that's what we called them back in the '90s.
if you wanted anything from City Hall, you had to go through them.
it was not fun. I'm sorry, Detectives.
Mr. Bright had to cancel his campaign event for tonight.
but he had some constituent meetings in his office. So, he'll be available to talk with you ASAP.
anything I can do. This is awful.
Thanks. - I'll let you know - as soon as I have more information. - Thank you.
Yeah, of course. Yep.
love to the kids.
it's Dave's wife, Gina.
their son's in Spain, but their daughter Kara's coming in from Kenyon tonight... Oh, my God.
Shelby's gonna be devastated.
Eliot, is there anything you can tell us that might help us solve this?
I-I didn't see him that much. I, um...
I canceled lunch last month for no good reason.
I did talk to him, uh, before the speeches.
he had a few, but, uh...
that was standard operating for Dave.
he did, though, seem... kind of preoccupied.
I don't know, 25 years, you know... it's, uh, he was best man at my wedding. He and Brighty flipped for it.
Eliot, if you need to take some time... Yeah, I don't...
I don't know how much good I can do here.
I just, uh... We're gonna find who did this.
you know that, don't you?
I do. Thanks.
okay. Thanks.
Hey, so, there's no signs of forced entry...
both the door and the lock are intact.
what about hotel employees with key-cards?
Yeah, I already ran down anyone who would've legitimately had access to this room.
the ones who weren't working the event on the roof at the time of death have alibis.
so Dave knows his killer, lets him in? That'd be my guess.
all right, get whatever security footage the hotel has.
I want to know everyone who even walked by this room today.
okay.
al, take a look at this Sterno. Something was burned in here.
we should have CSU bag it.
no sign of his keys, but his wallet is right here.
this wasn't about money. Well, it was about something.
there were a lot of people at the fund-raiser. A lot of powerful people.
and those powerful people are now our suspects.
sorry to keep you waiting.
no ONE can believe it.
how's Eliot doing? Okay, considering.
Yeah. The crazy thing is, I keep...
looking around for Dave to calm everyone down.
we just have a couple of questions, and a copy of the guest list from today's event would be helpful.
of course. Don, uh, could you pull a copy of the guest list from the Clean Air thing for the detectives here?
sure thing. - Thanks.
Oh, I'm sorry.
one second.
yes?
wonderful. Just have it delivered to the house.
thank you. Something like this happens, hard to give a damn about a-a rug delivery.
so, you had some questions.
Yeah, we wanted to get a sense of Dave in the workplace, you know, how he was with his coworkers.
were there any issues you might want to tell us about?
the guy ran a very friendly ship... just... calm, calm, calm.
that was his thing.
which, you know, is surprising, given where he came from.
what do you mean? - I don't know how much Eliot told you about us, but we were kind of an unlikely trio.
I was Upper East Side all the way.
dalton, Princeton. Eliot got ahead by his brains, right?
but Dave, he was a street kid.
Yeah, Valentine Ave. off Grand Concourse; he...
started as an errand boy for Koch when he was 21. Eliot mentioned Dave was upset at the fund-raiser.
do you have any idea why? Eliot said that?
that's funny.
I remember thinking he was a little distracted lately, too, just a feeling I got, you know?
the past few weeks, he'd get up in the middle of meetings to take personal calls.
never did that before. Yeah.
sorry.
I, uh, got everyone waiting for a statement.
so...
thank you. We're good for now.
Thanks, guys.
uh, Don will get you that invite list on your way out.
okay.
Dave's wife can see us now.
he's just too slick.
his dear friend is murdered, what, a few hours ago and he's already back here working it.
well, someone's got to rally the troops.
I THINK we should check his alibi.
and then, this is the three of them with the councilman, I think, dedicating some memorial in the park.
God, Bob looks so young.
I remember Dave forgot his tie.
eliot lent him thatone, I think. - Gina...
was your husband particularly upset about anything recently?
either at work or in his personal life?
no.
he... he was a little down with both of the kids being away, but...
we were gonna do some traveling after the election.
maybe even moving someplace a little warmer.
he wasn't planning to stay with Bright if he won?
no...
the whole power thing never meant too much to Dave.
that's more Bob.
and Eliot.
Dave just liked helping out his friend. He thought Bright would make a good mayor.
you agree? Yeah, you know...
at that level you gotta make a lot of compromises.
the higher you go, the harder they get.
at least, I know Dave felt that way.
were there any compromises in particular that bothered him?
no.
but I could tell something was on his mind.
when he was in a bad mood, he would take out this map of California, and start looking at towns out in the desert.
I saw a lot of the desert these past few weeks.
okay.
thank you.
and if you think of anything else...
I'm sorry, um, the man in...
in the photo on the right-hand side, with your husband?
Who-who is that? Oh, Dec McCauley.
Declan, he's a, he's a friend from back in the day.
he and Dave hauled trash with the Brooklyn Hauling Association when Dave was just out of high school.
wow, that's rough work. Yeah.
but Dave always said it was the best Job he ever had.
excuse me.
Dave's sister.
he was at the fund-raiser. Really?
doesn't seem like his kind of thing. - No. No, it doesn't.
Declan McCauley, president of the BHA for the past two years.
and by Brooklyn Hauling Association, what we're really talking about here is the Irish Mob.
now, officially, the BHA controls most of the private trash-hauling contracts in Brooklyn and the Bronx.
he wasn't on the guest list, so what was he doing there?
maybe the McCauleys are looking to get their hooks into power brokers at the event?
and they figure... they could use Dave to make the introductions.
Dave O'Bannon is no friend of the Mob. As far as you know.
I know Dave. - Okay, but, right now, a reputed Mob boss is our best lead in the investigation of his murder.
I think we should follow that lead.
of course. You're right.
we're here to talk about Dave O'Bannon. Heartbreaking is what that is.
we're hoping you could tell us what went on between the two of you at that fund-raiser.
nothing went on. He invited me and I went.
you got a copy of that invitation? 'Cause you're not on the guest list.
so, stuff falls through the cracks, I guess.
I'll tell you what... I'll look for it. - You and Dave have been friendly for a number of years.
is that right? Since he was a kid.
came to work for my uncle in 1986. And you stayed in touch ever since?
I'd see him at family things. You know, talked to him at the holidays.
stuff like that. And that was it?
you want a bite?
it's tough to get a nice, dry-aged rib eye these days.
you know where it's really hard to get a dry-aged rib eye?
Dannemora State Prison.
Mr. McCauley, everyone knows the Brooklyn Hauling Association owns half the private trash contracts in the five boroughs, and that you keep those contract prices down by discouraging landlords from asking for more.
thing is, what some call "discouraging,
the law calls extortion, bribery and felonious assault.
now, we may look the other way, because hey, somebody's picking up our garbage.
but that could change very fast.
look.
the BHA and Dave, we did things old-school. We had an arrangement.
I see a contract comes available in the city, I contact Dave, he makes some calls.
that's the way business has been run for 150 years in this city.
you were paying him to steer contracts your way? Paying him?
right.
O'Bannon never took a dime in his life.
I mean, not a turkey for this guy on Christmas. It wasn't about the money.
it was about taking care of family. Which is why bailing on me made no sense.
so, he wanted out of this arrangement? He told me it was over.
I had to start bidding Jobs public like some punk or something. I didn't know what was going on.
so I went there today to talk to him. I mean, I know the guy a long time.
he was in his head going on about tough choices, doing the right thing.
honestly, I figured it was the booze talking, so I heard him out and I left.
Dave was like my kid brother... I'd never touch him.
the fact is I got an alibi anyway.
after I left the hotel, I went to my niece's school.
they're doing Riverdance.
one thing, though, Detectives.
if Dave O'Bannon was working other handshake arrangements around town with construction, heat and air, whatever, and he came over all born-again virtuous like he done with me?
I can guarantee you those folks would not show similar restraint.
Hi, Jo. I was just leaving.
did you... find out anything new?
not really.
except, uh, however he sustained that wound to his carotid is definitely what killed him.
Oh, and this might be interesting.
I found makeup on Dave's thumb.
makeup? - Yeah.
I don't know what kind. I'll send it out to be analyzed.
they'll figure it out.
also, I found some partial prints in the room, but there were no matches in the system.
I, um, heard from Carrie there was some unusual substance in a can of Sterno?
that's a long shot.
but we sent it to the lab, see if they can retrieve anything.
he was a good man. Yeah, he was.
I'm sorry, Eliot.
I took a look at the trash-hauling deals Dave O'Bannon was backing out of with his pal Declan.
they're for a couple of these skinny skyscrapers being built around Central Park.
and they're pretty controversial because they've been approved despite the shade they're gonna throw across the park.
there's been a lot of press. "Activ8 NY.
I've never heard of it.
it's an online news service focusing mostly on muckraking in New York City.
they've been running a series of critical articles on all these buildings.
uh, cost overruns, union corruptions, falsified environmental records. - Wait a second.
that Woman.
champagne?
Pam Lisotta. I know her.
that's a pretty obscure blog. No, she was at the fund-raiser.
she was waitressing. Well, maybe it's a second Job.
I mean, how much money can you make working for a political blog?
no, I read the staff list that Bright gave us.
there was no Pam Lisotta on that list.
she must've come in under a different name.
the question is why?
fine, I used a friend's I. D. who caters at the Filmont to get into the event.
Dave O'Bannon's phone records indicate seven incoming calls all from an unknown burner cell.
do you want to save us the time of linking that phone to you?
okay. I was trying to get to him that's true.
it-it was for a series I'm writing. On the skyscrapers around Central Park?
I believe the process of awarding building rights is being short-circuited.
someone in city government is taking money from developers to award construction deals.
and one of Bright's duties as Manhattan borough president is to oversee the awarding of Major Construction Contracts.
you bet it is. And one of Bright's maJor donors,
Marcia Harrison, just happens to be in line for several of those deals.
so you think Bright's using his influence as borough president to throw contracts her way?
and in exchange, she makes significant contributions to Bright's mayoral campaign.
the problem is I had no proof. I needed a money trail, smoking gun.
I thought Dave O'Bannon might have one.
hold on, Dave was actively working to get Bright elected.
why would he help you? At first, he wouldn't.
but I finally got him to look around a little on his own.
when he called back, he seemed shocked. He said he'd found something.
he was willing to share it with me. He sent me a text.
well, burn note. I took a screen shot.
tomorrow, 10: 00 A. M. Penn Station. I'll have what you need.
but then...
I think he lost his nerve because he stopped returning my phone calls.
so, you snuck into the fund-raiser to confront him? - Yeah. But I never had the chance.
how do we know that once Dave stopped cooperating, you didn't just go to his room and make him?
I worked the whole party. There was a supervisor from hell who wouldn't let me out of his sight.
you can talk to him. I was loading out when the cops found Dave's body.
so, maybe Marcia Harrison got wind that Dave was gonna blow the whistle on that whole cash for contract scheme she was running with Robert Bright?
well, it's a motive.
Plus, she was at the fund-raiser, so she had access to Dave's hotel room.
hold on... we're talking about accusing one of the top real estate developers in this city of fraud and possibly murder?
not to mention implicating the man who may be the next mayor of New York.
we need more than just the word of a blogger.
there's nothing on Dave's work computers.
but I say we find whatever he was gonna hand over to Lisotta today at Penn Station, we got our proof.
maybe it's still at Penn Station in a locker. His keys were missing.
no sign of his keys. His wallet is right here.
this wasn't about money.
is there a storage locker near Penn Station that has the word "Pete" in it?
I don't know... Pete's Storage, Pete's... something.
Bingo! Pete's Storage and Packing. It's on 36th Street between 8th and 9th.
Yes!
no, we got cameras that cover the cashier, but not back here... it's not that kind of place.
what kind of place is it?
look, honestly, in the property retention business, you get what you pay for.
Hey, you getting evicted tomorrow, you need a place to store your crap?
you come to me. But Fort Knox we're not.
and if you could afford Fort Knox, you wouldn't be getting evicted, right?
so, what kind of security do you have in this place?
well, our clients get a code to get in the hallway and a lock for the unit... that's about it.
I would say the system is fairly secure.
with an emphasis on "fairly.
no luck on the storage locker, I hear?
Nope. But I'm reviewing exterior security footage from the area, hoping someone familiar pops up.
you get any results back on the makeup Webster found on the body?
Oh, yeah. As a matter of fact, some fancy French stuff called JYB.
cost 500 bucks an ounce or something.
Belgium. Huh?
JYB, it's from Belgium.
okay.
so, we know someone entered the hallway at Pete's Storage using the key code at 5: 12 P. M.
they cleared out Dave's locker. There wasn't even anyone else in the building on Sunday.
and whatever was in that locker has got to implicate Bright.
al, do you have a second?
Yeah.
listen, I know I said I was gonna stay out of this, but this is all pretty thin, isn't it?
no, I don't think so. We know Dave was gonna turn over the documents, and we know the documents were taken from Dave's locker.
actually, we don't, strictly speaking, know any of that.
for the sake of your career and for the careers of everyone in this section, if you plan on accusing David O'Bannon,
robert Bright and Marcia Harrison of being involved in a scandal of this magnitude, you're gonna need a lot more than an online blogger and an empty locker.
a lot more.
you guys got to see this.
you can imagine my distress when Mr. O'Bannon, a member of the Borough President's office, approached me offering to procure building contracts for me if I would contribute to Robert Bright's campaign.
he told me that the Borough President himself was not aware of this offer, but that if I agreed, he would raise the plan with him.
I, of course, told Mr. O'Bannon I would have no part of it and immediately contacted Bob Bright. Bob?
Dave O'Bannon was a longtime friend and, as Ms. Harrison mentioned, a trusted aide.
but after my own internal investigation, it appears that he was attempting to sell the power and influence of my office for money.
I want to assure the people of New York that Dave O'Bannon was doing so on his own, and for his own good.
I welcome a full investigation by the Manhattan DA into this matter, but, for now, I'm...
I'm heartbroken by this betrayal.
you're a jackass, you know that?
Eliot... - How could you sell Dave out?
if you know it, he couldn't possibly have done what you said.
okay, you think I want to believe it? He was our friend, Eliot.
I-I looked after him, I took him with me for years.
you took him? He...
he brought you up, he made you. Yeah, well...
I've been carrying him for the last 18 months.
something was going on. You would've known if you'd checked in on him from time to time.
he was dirty.
there's evidence. Lots of evidence.
your guys would've found it. What would you do in my position?
I would've made damn sure I was right before I went public.
I am sure.
look, we always knew Dave was street.
we dressed him up, he looked the part, but deep down, who knows?
sometimes people just go back to being who they are. - Bob.
we really are running behind. All right.
I'm sorry, Eliot.
What'd you get from Marcia Harrison? She handed over everything.
full access to her financials, independent audit of all her dealings, complete calendar.
she was upstairs at the time of O'Bannon's murder.
she couldn't be cleaner.
bright, too. Turned over his financials and his alibi is airtight.
okay, we know Dave O'Bannon was involved in some kind of corruption.
Lisotta says he was trying to come clean. And someone didn't want that.
same person who knew about the locker.
I want the names of everyone Dave O'Bannon had contact with in the last few weeks leading up to his murder.
I'm guessing our killer's in that group. Names, Jay.
I'm on it, boss.
you get very far tracking O'Bannon?
I'm combing through closed circuit footage, trying to fill in the last month of his life... restaurants, clubs.
traced a credit card receipt last week to this place.
Jeffrey's, over on 49th St.
Yeah, I know it. Looks like we got nothing on O'Bannon going inside, but maybe he entered through the back. Now... that's the time from the receipt.
I'm waiting to see if there's anybody who has ties to the skyscrapers or the trash contracts who might have been going in or out.
can you... So far, I got nothing.
can you widen out right there, at the curb?
the car? - Yeah.
Yeah.
holy smokes, that's a classic. They stopped making 'em in '74.
see? I told you, boss... disco killed everything.
you want to take a look at the plate?
I can enhance it. No, no, thanks.
I'm all right.
warning: External Log-in Delson, E.
Hey, Al, you got a minute?
look, I, uh... I don't know what to do about this thing.
what's the matter?
look, I totally get why Eliot's really invested in this particular case, but I just found out he logged into my computer through a back-door program and downloaded all the files related to the O'Bannon case.
I know he's our boss, but... seems kind of weird, right?
Yeah, it does. And there's a couple other things, you know, questions he's been asking. I mean...
is there something going on I should know about? I sure hope not.
Eliot. What's going on?
Jay just told me about the files.
easy, Burns, it's nothing. I just thought it would be best if I kept a low profile on this.
low profile? Given your personal involvement here, you should have no profile.
this isn't about you. It is not about the investigation.
it is a personal matter.
if it's about Dave O'Bannon, it is about the investigation.
are you covering for him?
covering for...?
al, Dave was...
having an affair with my wife.
What?! - Yeah.
that little patch of makeup Webster found on him? That $500-an-ounce one?
the reason I know it's from Belgium is because I bought it for Shelby the last time I was in Brussels.
that doesn't prove anything. It's an exclusive brand.
it's not even sold in the U. S.
then I see her car parked outside of a restaurant that I know Dave's eating in.
they're friends, they're having lunch... Well, he came in the back door.
he probably left the same way. It's funny, huh?
the Aspen Conference last March.
Shelby was presenting for her environmental do-gooder group.
she stays at the Twelve Tree...
that sour little hotel in the woods?
Dave O'Bannon had a room three doors down.
and on and on and wearily on, it goes.
receipts of Dave's that Jay's been tracking.
they match times Shelby told me she was meeting friends or getting her hair done or all the... usual excuses.
I'm sorry.
well, she'll have information on O'Bannon's state of mind.
maybe he bared his soul along with everything else.
I suppose you'll need to talk to her.
I think you need to talk to her.
you wouldn't understand.
what don't I understand? Come on, Shelby.
lay it on me.
what possible reason could I have given you for having an affair with one of my closest friends?
I never slept with Dave.
Aspen? Hmm?
Yeah.
I know about Aspen.
I... Dave just... He happened to be there.
and I'm glad he was. Secret rendezvous at Jeffrey's?
we had drinks. How did your makeup get on his hand?
we found it. It's a little forensic thing we do.
this is why, you know.
we don't know each other anymore, Eliot. I mean, you don't know me.
no, I don't. Fine, what... you...
want us to go back to Sharon?
because I'm pretty sure she's gonna say cheating on your husband is not the way to...
I never slept with Dave!
that afternoon, at the fund-raiser...
I, uh... I went early to talk to him.
I had made up my mind to leave you.
I cried, but I knew I had to do it.
Dave talked me out of it.
he took my face in his hands...
and told me what a loving, wonderful man you are.
and that you deserved a second chance.
so...
there's your answer to the little...
forensic thing.
what's my answer?
that's what I want to know.
she never spoke with Dave about his business dealings or anything else, for that matter.
I guess he was just a shoulder to cry on. Eliot, I'm sorry.
Yeah, me too.
Hey, boss, uh, - is this a bad time? - It's terrible. Come in.
okay. I got the analysis back of the ash in the Sterno can, from the crime scene.
turns out it was a piece of paper. We also found some adhesive and some ink.
a sticker of some kind.
U KNOW I WAS KIDDING
like from a name tag you might wear at, say, a fundraiser?
could be. Sure. - Excuse me.
Bob, Debby Ellenson just wants five minutes, and they're gonna need you up on the dais.
I'm sorry, Detectives.
Mr. Bright had to cancel a campaign event for tonight.
but he had some constituent meetings at the office, so he'll be available to talk with you ASAP.
it was a name tag. Bright's aide, Amanda Temple.
she had one name tag on before Dave was murdered and a completely different one after.
what do we know about her? Campaign advisor Bright brought in from Chicago.
fixer type. Reputation for hardball.
so to protect Bright, she plays hardball, she kills Dave, then she realizes she lost her name tag, makes herself a new one.
Jay, did the analysis indicate what kind of ink was used on that name tag?
Yeah. It's, uh... Ink's from a fountain pen.
something fancy called a Montegrappa. I think I'm saying it right.
I'm sorry. What are you doing?
Oh, hi, Amanda. Is this your car?
Yes. What is this, Detective? - Huh.
illinois plates. You've been in the state for over six months, and you should've gotten new plates by now.
you have to be kidding me. What, they have you handing out tickets now?
it's, like, budget cuts, you know?
here we go. Sign this, please.
can I have the pen? - I'm sorry.
don't take it personally. It's just that I loan people my pens to sign these.
I've lost, like, 100. I got to draw the line somewhere, you know?
fine. Whatever.
Wow. Is-is that a Montegrappa?
Yeah. - You know, they make their own ink for their pens.
very unique. - Great. Thanks for the education.
we done here? No.
we're just beginning.
the ink from your pen is a perfect match to the sample we have in evidence.
doesn't conclusively place me in the hotel room.
once we checked your prints against the partials we picked up, it got pretty conclusive.
Plus, the cut to Dave's throat was messy... my guess is, once we test your clothes for blood...
I wasn't... - There's a big difference between murder one and manslaughter, Amanda.
we know you killed him. Help me out here, so I can help you.
it was an accident.
I didn't go there to hurt him.
things, they just got out of hand, I swear.
what happened? O'Bannon and I set everything up.
we were going to approach Marcia Harrison.
and then he just changed his mind. - So you go to his room at the hotel to change it back.
Yes. But he was furious and...
he'd been drinking and... said that I was what was wrong with politics today.
told me he'd been talking to some Reporter. When I tried to calm him down, he came at me.
so you cut his throat in self-defense? - I was scared.
he was threatening me. I... picked up the knife.
I tried to keep him back, and the next thing I know, he's on the ground.
I didn't mean to kill him.
what did Bright know?
nothing.
I told him that I had spoken to Dave but that he was fine when I left the room.
then what was in those files you took from Dave's storage locker?
what files?
I don't know anything about a locker.
I don't get it. She confessed to killing Dave, but when I pressed her about the information he had, she pulled the plug. She's calling her lawyer right now.
she didn't implicate anybody else? Not Marcia Harrison or Bob Bright.
she says it was just her and Dave.
she'll go down for this, probably manslaughter and some corruption charge. But it ends with her.
Oh. Here's the star of the show.
Mr. Bright. Mr. Bright. Are we to believe you knew nothing about what was going on in your office?
there was clearly a group inside my staff that worked covertly to use the influence of this office to their benefit. I'm sorry.
that's all I know right now.
Oh, I'm sorry. One second.
Yes. Wonderful. Just have it delivered to the house.
I, uh, got everyone waiting for a statement.
that ringtone.
I know where the files are.
okay, listen, when we went to Bright's office, he got a call, right? He said it was about a rug.
it was Amanda. She was calling him about the documents being delivered.
the times match up. We were there at the same time somebody got into Dave's storage locker.
she had just gotten the stuff from his locker. That's what was being delivered to his house.
the files.
why are you doing this?
look, whatever it is you think you're looking for, it won't stick.
you just... You're burning a bridge here, a bridge that can still lead to our dream. Remember?
me in the mayor's office. You, police commissioner.
we can still live that dream... we will.
think of the good we can do for this town.
yeah... what about what we can do for Amanda?
you knew about the skyscraper deal... everything...
that's why she's protecting you, right?
so once you become mayor, you can repay the favor.
it's enough, Bob. It's enough.
Dave had nothing to do with it, did he?
you know what's gonna happen, Eliot, don't you?
Yeah, I know.
I don't care.
you don't care? October 18, 1998?
found this in the hall closet.
open it up. Eliot...
don't destroy everything. Cuff him.
Yeah. Say good-bye to MaJor Crimes, your friends...
everything.
what happened in 1998?
I used to blame it on us being young.
but now I'm thinking...
that's just who we are.
we were...
interns... me, Bright and Dave...
for a senator.
doesn't matter who.
he loved us.
he gave us that atrocious nickname, the Three Amigos.
anyway, one night, uh, I get a call, 4: 00 in the morning.
he's in Hell's Kitchen and something's gone wrong.
we go down and...
find him in a room there with a, um...
well, with a girl who had...
been careless with her opiates.
she fell asleep, never woke up.
he didn't know what to do.
we did.
we made sure nobody knew he was there.
and going forward, whenever we needed a favor...
well, the senator was there for us.
that was a long time ago.
doesn't seem that way to me.
you headed home, Eliot?
Mm-mm. Not just yet.
figured I'd savor my last few moments here.
it's not gonna go that way.
no one's gonna believe anything Bright says. Not after this.
I don't know. I wish I had your faith.
you don't need faith. You got me.
and my buddy Declan. - What's he doing here?
october 18, 1998. You don't remember?
maybe?
well, Declan here definitely remembers. Tell him, Dec.
my family's had the hauling contract for Yankee Stadium going on 40 years.
they gave us all a bunch of tickets to the first...
second.
second game of the World Series.
I invited Dave. He brought you along as well.
Yeah, but I-I never went. Sure, you did.
there were 15 of us. We stayed till the very last out.
we went back to my place. Everybody remembers how excited you were.
what else?
it was such a special night...
you kept your ticket stub.
what a thoughtful gift.
you got a pretty good memory. It's what I'm known for.
that's funny. Me, too.
thank you.
it's what Dave would have wanted.
what you doing sitting out here?
just waiting for you.
I feel so bad for Dave.
seeing how far Bright was willing to go, it...
must've made him question everything.
only it was too late for him.
what is that?
uh, that's, uh, peach blueberry.
from Sweet Creations in Nashville?
I had to, uh, pull a few strings. Course you did.
don't go.
come on, where are you?
I'm taking you down this time, Carrie. A boy can dream, Sean.
remember, you promised if I beat you this time, I get a kiss.
today, Barry, you get a kiss anyway.
what about me? Do I get a kiss, too?
you know, Quinton, a rain check. About ten years, okay?
all right, what's it gonna be, boys? Bishop to D3.
Uh-huh. Knight to F6.
okay. - Even with you incredible memory, there's a lot of boards with a lot of moves.
you can't win. Pawn to G5.
my memory is more than incredible, Barry.
it's perfect, which is why I remember the same Budapest Gambit October 14 of last year.
are you ready?
rook to C1.
Sean... Queen to F7.
Barry... Queen to H5.
surrender and keep dreaming. Oh, thank you very much!
don't look so sad. - Carrie Wells!
still undefeated! Hey, Al.
two Chinese tourists found the body when it washed up on shore.
they called it in, but not before posting a video of the whole thing on Facebook.
the mayor brought us in to control spin. Who is he?
no I.D. Kid didn't have a wallet on him.
Hey, Jo. Hey, there.
okay. Male, early 20s.
looks like a single gunshot wound to the back of the head.
been in the water maybe eight to ten hours, according to rigor.
I'm estimating the time of death to be around midnight, but I'll know more when I get back to the lab.
I've seen him before.
missing SAM MILLER
on a flyer. His name is Sam Miller.
he was reported missing last week.
looks like we found him.
I just got off this endless conference call with the Tourist Board.
good Lord, those people can chat. I assume they want this wrapped up quickly?
they want this wrapped up yesterday. What do we know so far?
Sam Miller was 22, an environmental studies major at Denton University, by all accounts a good kid, good grades.
no criminal record. And according to his school records,
Sam lived with his parents Bruce and Shelly Miller, up in Throggs Neck, in the Bronx.
at least up until a month ago, when he dropped out of school and pretty much out of sight.
the kid left home... no forwarding address, no way to contact him.
he only took his cell phone with him.
after his mother didn't hear from him for three weeks, she filed a missing persons report.
what mother waits three weeks to file a missing persons report?
hmm. What do we know about this family?
well, Sam's dad owns three supermarkets between Castle Hill and Hunt's Point.
he also has one hell of a temper.
in the past six months, patrol's responded to the apartment four times after neighbors heard them all fighting.
no charges were filed.
we need to find out what was going on in that house and why it took so long to report him missing.
all right, keep me apprised. The FBI I can handle.
but the Tourist Board, they're... they're just mean.
we're very sorry for your loss. Mrs. Miller, you took a while before you filed a missing persons report on Sam.
any reason for that?
he took off about a month ago.
Sam was in college.
he'd go off the grid from time to time... a week, ten days wasn't out of the ordinary, but...
once it became a few weeks without a phone call, that's when I knew something was wrong. Mr. Miller, we're trying to piece together what happened so I have to ask:
on a few occasions, your neighbors heard you fighting with Sam loud enough they had to call the police?
what does that have to do with who killed my boy?
would you mind if I took a look around Sam's bedroom?
Why? Well, anything I could learn about Sam might help.
I'm sorry.
this is all just so hard.
I can't imagine what you must be going through.
paroxetine.
was Sam depressed? Uh, he had OCD.
but it was under control for a while now.
detective Wells, I know that my husband may seem a bit gruff.
he and Sam fought, but you have to know that Bruce loved Sam very much.
and he never got violent with him or anything like that?
no.
parents know how heated those fights can get, but Bruce would never hurt Sam.
we're not making any accusations.
I can't believe this. - We're just trying to find out what you argued about.
what every parent argues about with their kid:
what the hell Sam's gonna do with his life.
the neighbors... what they heard...
Bruce has had a short fuse lately.
what with his employees wanting to unionize the market.
where were you around midnight last night? Oh, you son of a bitch!
you know, I was with my wife, at home, worrying about my son.
how dare you accuse me of anything!
look, I argued with Sam because I loved him.
I would never have hurt him.
it's gotten really scary.
these union people, they put dead rats at our door.
they broke into your building? Yeah.
a little over a month ago.
that's right around the time Sam left, right?
and you hadn't spoken to him since? No.
you don't think they hurt my son, do you? I don't know.
but I'm gonna find out.
here's what I've got:
I pulled a 38-caliber round from his frontal lobe.
the point of entry was at the base of the skull, passed through the basal ganglia.
he died instantly. - So Sam was shot and then tossed in the river.
I'm betting whoever killed Sam was hoping his body would get swept out into the ocean.
makes sense.
this tox screen came back clean, except for his OCD meds.
his T-cells were up... he probably had a cold.
he looks like a sweet kid. It's such a shame.
we're not gonna back down.
I got one message for Miller: a union united will never be divided.
guy's name is Ray Pulaski. He's been head of the GSWUA for the past three years.
guy knows how to work a picket line. And he's been effective.
Pulaski's been unionizing supermarkets borough by borough.
he started off in Queens with a few grocery stores in Astoria, and now he's hitting the Bronx.
does he have a record? - Not so much a record, but he likes to stir the pot.
on at least two separate occasions this year, NYPD had to respond to an altercation at one of his protests.
according to Sam's mother,
Pulaski's guys left some dead rats at their front door a month ago to send 'em a message.
maybe Pulaski went after Sam to make sure they heard that message loud and clear.
what are you busting my balls for? You guys are cops.
what would your lives be like without a union protecting you?
hmm. Can you account for your whereabouts for the past 48 hours? - Sure, I can.
I been working three different picket lines nonstop. I haven't seen my own family in two days.
you kept up your picket even after Miller's only son was murdered? - Hey, no rest for the weary, right?
I'm guessing you got witnesses to back your story? - Yeah.
those hardworking Americans over there, fighting to make a decent wage.
people might think unions are dead, but they got another thing coming.
you want to explain the rodents you deposited at the Millers' door?
it was a stunt. Morale can sag on a picket line.
I had to rally the troops. You might want to start by buying 'em some pizza.
we subpoenaed Sam's cell records.
you called Sam at least eight times since your protest started.
Hey, the kid knew what side to be on. He knew his dad was wrong.
Sam was helping you?
who do you think let us in to drop off the rats?
he was giving us inside information on his dad.
look, Sam was a good kid.
he cared about the everyday worker and what we're fighting for.
but maybe his dad found out, because Sam stopped cooperating a few weeks back and I never heard from him since.
now listen, doll, unless you're gonna arrest me, I got a picket to get back to.
first thing, pull the news footage just to make sure about his alibi, but we got to get Miller back in.
Shelley already alibied him.
we gotta get Miller alone so he can't intimidate his wife.
then we'll see how long that alibi stands up. - Yeah.
Yeah, okay. Damn it.
so, no luck with that union guy Pulaski?
well, aside from the cops breaking up some scuffles at his protests, all he's got are a couple citations for obstructing traffic.
well, maybe I'll get lucky with the dad.
you know...
I still don't get how you wait three weeks to report your kid missing.
Oh, come on, Murray, Sam's in college.
when I was in school, I'd go a month without talking to my parents.
I can't imagine not knowing where Maia is for that long.
your daughter's nine years old. Let's revisit this in ten years.
no, trust me, I will now. You know what?
you probably would.
what is that supposed to mean? Nothing, no... I don't know.
I'm just saying that I'm sure Maia loves the fact that you bring her snack to school every single day... in a purple lunch box.
she likes orange slices and provolone.
and it has to stay cool. Of course it does.
all the time. So, what, I'm a helicopter mom now?
no, I wouldn't say that. I think you're more like a... a bulldozer mom.
Oh, God.
better still, steamroller mom.
that's funny.
and I was gonna offer you an animal cracker.
Whoop...
when did you find out Sam was helping Pulaski?
I already told you, I had no idea Sam was giving them information.
Sam was undermining everything you worked for. You seriously think I'd kill my own son?
the man who put him in rehab three times, even though Sam was hell-bent on killing himself with those drugs?
Sam was a drug addict?
it started when he was 17.
prescription drugs, mostly. We kept it quiet.
his mother and I have sacrificed... so much.
but we'd do anything to help Sam.
he started abusing oxycodone in order to self-medicate his OCD.
you have no idea how horrible that addiction is.
each time Sam went through withdrawal he... he couldn't think straight, and it...
it nearly killed his mother. But Sam's blood work was clean.
there was no oxy in his system. It may not have been in his system when he died.
Sam was using again.
it was that damn protest group he got involved with in college.
what protest group? Stand Up To The System.
they're...
occupy Wall Street"? types.
he changed after he met them. Became agitated.
the fights your neighbors heard? Were they about this group?
they turned my own son against me.
my family has been through... so much.
those deadbeats killed my son, whether they pulled the trigger or not.
Millers are sticking to their story and Pulaski checks out, as well.
what have you got?
I was just checking out Sam's protest group, and according to the message boards, some of the members grew their own weed out on these remote islands, just off the Bronx.
they say which ones? - No.
message boards were shut down two months ago.
group was disbanded after the leader was arrested for possession with intent to distribute.
what if Sam kept growing weed on these islands?
I mean, we know dealers far more dangerous than these kids use these islands as a way station for their product.
you're thinking Sam crossed dealers who were protecting their own turf.
show me the islands. - All right.
well...
okay, these three islands are directly in the current pattern upriver from where we found Sam's body,
I don't recognize any of them.
wards Island had the first bridge crossing into Manhattan.
south Brother Island, the little one there... that's where Jacob Ruppert, early owner of the Yankees, had a summer house.
I guess I'll take Bizarre Trivia for 500, Alex.
and North Brother Island is where Typhoid Mary was quarantined for 30 years.
typhoid Mary?
Sam was reading up on Typhoid Mary.
tell me more about North Brother Island.
it's deserted now.
nobody's lived there since the '60s. Now it's a bird sanctuary for herons.
sounds like the perfect place to grow weed without being noticed.
and the perfect place... To get away with murder.
Yeah.
you drive a boat better than you drive a car.
I'll take that as a compliment.
this place is kind of...
spooky, huh?
I heard it was haunted.
what? - Yeah.
back in the 1800s, when this place was filled with quarantined patients, they used to ship the bodies back to Port Morris from this very spot.
what are you doing?
well, I'm talking... - What are you doing?
no, I'm making conversation. - No, you're not. You're trying...
you're not mak... you're trying to freak me out.
Oh, you're spooked. - You know what?
I'm not spooked, - You're spooked.
I'm focused.
we've got a case... Want to talk about spooked?
uh, Saranac Lake, August 23, 2000. A bird flew into our room...
it was a bat. - "It was a bat.
it was a very large bat. - "Ooh! There's a bat in our room!
my God!- Can you let anything go?
you screamed like a little girl, didn't you? Well, guess what?
I bet there's a lot of bats on this island. Who's spooked now?
scared of bats... and giant bugs crawling up in your suit...
just think... once, this whole place was teeming with people.
Yeah, contaminated people.
for a bad-ass cop, you seem a little jumpy.
I am so not jumpy.
what was that?
sometimes a bird sanctuary is just a bird sanctuary.
wait a minute, something's different.
sounds like the perfect place to grow weed without being noticed.
you know, your birds are pretty handy with woodwork.
police, DON'T MOVE, SHOW ME YOUR HANDS
I told you, we're not growing pot out here.
no, but you are trespassing on government property.
what's your name? Jordan Davis.
eyes to the wall, Jordan.
I'm just saying... - And shut your mouth.
no weapons, no drugs. They're clean.
all right, listen, what are you doing here?
minimizing our ecological footprint.
What?! Moved out here about a month ago.
been living off the land.
see, society has been destroying this Earth at an insane rate.
people consume far more than they need.
please don't turn us in, we're not hurting anyone.
we only hid from you because we thought you were park rangers.
Hey, Jordan, I couldn't find the... What's going on?
you went to Denton College with Sam Miller, didn't you?
Yes. Is everything okay?
I can't believe he's dead. You and Sam were close, yeah?
Yeah.
Sam and I took Environmental Health together and...
since the first day, it felt like...
like we knew each other, you know?
that we could trust each other, even though we had just met.
I haven't been able to trust many people in my life, so...
listen, I know how hard this must be for you.
and I want you to know no one here is gonna get in any trouble, okay?
I gotta ask you:
was Sam or any of you guys growing weed on this island?
God, n... no. We... we don't allow drugs here, no weapons, no temptations of any kind. That's...
that's how we look out for each other and stay clean.
you all had drug problems? Well, not everyone, but...
none of us really have a home to go back to, so...
look, we weren't doing anything illegal.
I promise.
I can show you our gardens.
sure.
we use these tunnels as a shortcut. This way.
watch your step.
be careful, there's a big hole here. Stay close to the wall.
this is like an obstacle course, huh?
it's like a maze. It can get really confusing in here, but you get used to it.
wait... No, it's... it's this one.
sorry, there's so many doors, I always forget.
uh, stay to the right. - Ah. Okay.
wow, wow this is incredible.
Sam was working on purifying our water. He was in charge of our garden.
that's why he took our boat back to the city... he was gonna pick up his last paycheck and get some seeds.
wait a second. Sam left the island?
yesterday. - Alone?
Yeah.
he said he'd only be gone for a couple of hours, but...
Louisa, did Sam have a problem with anyone on the island?
any issues that you know about? No.
no, they respected him.
we really just gonna leave these kids here?
well, most of them don't have anywhere else to go, Al.
I mean, what are we gonna do? They can't live here.
listen, we have more important things to do than bust a bunch of kids for trespassing, okay?
come on.
you left them squatting on North Brother Island? Think of it as camping.
or what you've read about camping.
I'll have you know I hiked the entire Inca Trail to the top of Machu Picchu.
that's walking, not camping. You two are seriously debating this right now?
Sam's girlfriend, Louisa, told us Sam went alone back to Manhattan yesterday afternoon to get supplies.
we know he never made it back to the island and was killed around midnight.
those kids couldn't have killed Sam.
they couldn't even get off the island, 'cause Sam had their only boat.
and you and Carrie believe their story?
Jay's looking for the boat to confirm it, but, yes, we do. - All right.
finding Sam's killer is our priority, but, make no mistake, we will revisit this...
both the camping and the squatting.
Hey, guys.
NYPD found a Zodiac tied off the dock at Barretto Point Park.
park rangers didn't recognize the boat, thought it was stolen so they called it in.
turns out the boat's owned by Jordan Davis, but he never reported it stolen.
that's one of the kids on the island. Were Sam's prints on the boat?
well, we got a couple of partials, but check this out.
ran facial recognition, got a positive hit on Sam.
this was taken at 4: 00 p. m. the day Sam was killed. He took that boat alone.
well, that is definitely Sam, which means Louisa's story checks out.
all right, so we need to retrace his steps from when he got to Manhattan to when he was killed.
Louisa told us he was on his way to pick up his final paycheck - so he could buy seeds. - Okay, according to Sam's work history, his last known job was at a clinical research lab run out of Denton by a Dr. Paul Hughes.
I'll see if Dr. Hughes can fit you in, but he's been in meetings with Mazurtech executives all morning.
Oh, I think he'll fit us in.
Mazurtech funds all of his research.
excuse me, Dr. Hughes. Uh, these detectives are here to see you.
Oh, please, please come in. We were just wrapping up.
it's good to see you again, Paul. - Yeah.
good afternoon. What can I do for you, Detectives?
detective Wells, I'm Lieutenant Burns.
we're investigating the murder of Sam Miller. I understand he worked here.
Yes. I... I heard what happened on the news.
I... I'm still in shock.
Sam was a wonderful young man.
about two days ago, he came by to pick up his final paycheck.
that can't be. I haven't seen Sam since he quit a month ago.
Yep. As you can see, he was paid in full.
have you had any contact with Sam in the last few weeks?
no.
I tried calling a few times, but he never returned.
I spoke with his father once, but Mr. Miller said it was a family matter and I should mind my own business, so...
what did Sam do in the lab? Data entry, mostly.
I'm an infectious disease specialist, and Sam compiled the results of my research.
Sam loved science, figuring out how the world works, which is why I knew that there was something very wrong when he left.
how so? - I've been Sam's advisor since he was a freshman.
I probably shouldn't say anything, but...
Sam had a problem with prescription medication.
we know about the stints in rehab.
I cure diseases, but I had no cure for Sam's addiction.
he fought so hard to stay clean but, uh, not always successfully, I'm afraid.
I offered to help him, but Sam wouldn't let me. Sam wouldn't let anyone help him.
okay. Thank you.
if... if there's anything more that I can do, please just let me know.
so let's say Sam fell off the wagon. - Right.
what, do you think that's the reason he lied to Louisa about why he came back to Manhattan?
they all want to stay clean, Sam couldn't. So he makes up an excuse to get a fix.
Jay, pull up a list from the NITRO computer.
everyone arrested for dealing drugs near Denton University in the past year.
you're thinking a drug deal gone wrong? Sometimes the simplest answer is the right one.
thank you, oh, wise one. Jay.
okay, we got Annie Cox, age 29.
currently serving six months in the Tombs for possession with intent to distribute.
lamar Deaton, A.K.A. Sandman, 35... just finished court-ordered rehab.
lives with his mother in Queens. And this next gem, Eddie Codd, 31.
multiple possession charges.
his last W-2 is from Miller's Grocery on Jerome Ave. - That's Sam's father's market.
Eddie Codd? Police. We'd like to talk to you.
why do they always run? Try to keep up, old man!
who you calling old?
cut him off!
come on, come on.
took you long enough.
what? How 'bout my tackle? You see that?
not bad for a guy who only shaves once a week.
what? Oh, I get it. Because I called you old back there?
and it's twice a week, by the way.
come on.
I swear I didn't kill Sam.
hadn't seen him in weeks. Didn't even know he was dead.
you're lying. We know you sold to Sam the night he died.
that's not true.
okay, fine.
kid came by around 9:00, but I didn't sell him anything.
so you did see him. - Yeah.
I mean, Sam was tripping out.
said he needed something for his nerves, you know? But he didn't have any money.
I'm not a charity.
what was he tripping out about? - Who knows?
you know? He was on his cell, screaming at some doctor, saying how the guy screwed him over.
I figured that the doc didn't give him the meds he wanted, so that's why he came to see me.
look, all I know is that the kid was going nuts and he needed to chill.
this is the way I see it: you were the last person to see Sam alive.
how much you want to bet if we tossed your apartment right now, we'd find it full of pharmaceuticals you are not supposed to have?
guy like you...
two prior convictions.
I couldn't have been the last one to see Sam.
you know, come to think of it, Sam said he was gonna hook up with someone later that night.
come to think of it," how convenient for you.
no, it's true. Said he had a big meet by 29th and 1st.
figured he was scoring some meds, since it's right by that hospital.
which hospital? Wentley.
I mean, the dude seemed anxious. What did Sam do in the lab?
data entry, mostly. I'm an infectious disease specialist.
I want to know what Hughes is hiding.
he said he didn't see Sam... I think he did.
he's lying. - Let's find out why.
we'll clear it.
clear.
I need CSU on scene at Denton University, the Virus Lab. DOA.
I CANNOT LIVE WITH WHAT I'VE DONE. MAY GOD FORGIVE ME.
possible suicide.
there were two canisters in here, and they're missing.
one of them had a biohazard label.
Hughes was an infectious disease specialist, so what the hell was in those canisters?
he was working on a vaccine for something called an auroraevirus.
Jay, what can you tell us about the auroraevirus?
wow, this virus is pretty brutal.
there was a lethal outbreak in Ecuador in 2005.
it's not airborne, but if you eat or drink the virus, you'll have flu-like symptoms...
cough, fever... until the virus kills you in about ten days.
no known cure. We gotta find those canisters.
all right, listen up. We got to move quickly.
if that virus gets in the water supply, we could be facing a huge epidemic.
we got a ballistics match on Hughes's gun. The same gun that shot Sam.
we found Hughes's car in the faculty parking lot. - Let me guess, it had traces of Sam's blood.
so Hughes kills his own student, then he kills himself.
or someone kills Hughes and steals the virus.
I'm tracking down everyone who had authorized access to the lab.
al, security cameras were shut down in Hughes' office.
we still have no eyes on who went to the lab and took the virus. - There has to be video of the hallways.
still waiting for the university to send it over. - Get 'em to speed it up!
come on! Let's go.
Jo, Sam had cold symptoms when he was killed, right?
is it possible it was something else? I was just coming to find you.
Sam's final blood work came back, and it wasn't a cold.
the auroraevirus. Hughes's research only reached the animal testing phase.
the FDA just recently denied him approval for human testing.
so how did Sam get infected?
let's take a look at what the police pulled from Hughes's lab.
okay.
let's see. Test results, student evaluations...
farming catalogues...
wait. Wait, enlarge those catalogues. - Yeah.
the irrigation system.
listen to me, Sam wanted to purify the water on the island, right?
let's say he went to Hughes for help.
that gives Hughes the perfect opportunity.
Sam brings back the virus, thinking it's something to purify the water.
why would Hughes do that? He specializes in curing infectious diseases, not spreading them.
you said it yourself... the FDA wouldn't approve human trials.
he needed to find his very own human lab rats.
right? He needed to do that to test his vaccine.
he had to get them sick first, so he could cure them. He wanted to be Edward Jenner.
who? Edward Jenner is credited with curing smallpox, but in order to do that, he infected healthy children to prove his vaccine.
we don't know how many children died as a result.
Oh, my God.
okay, I'm on my way.
Hey, Jay, what do you got?
Hey, Carrie. So here's the security video from the university hallway.
now, the video starts at the time Hughes' lab cameras went down.
there. The viral canisters have to be in his backpack... right there.
wait...
that's the guy from Mazurtech.
he's the one who's been overseeing Hughes' research grants.
guy's name is Wendell Kuryak, president of Mazurtech Pharmaceuticals.
they specialize in developing vaccines for diseases throughout the world.
or at least they used to.
recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.
if Mazurtech was having financial trouble and if his company put a lot of money into that vaccine, the next thing would be to test it, right?
and who better to test it on than isolated, off-grid kids on an island?
which means Kuryak and Hughes are working together.
I think Hughes used Sam.
I think he tricked him into contaminating the water supply on the island.
I think Sam found out, confronted Hughes, Hughes killed him.
then, conveniently, Hughes kills himself.
the virus and the vaccine are missing, which leaves...
Kuryak. - His company's reputation...
everything... is riding on proving he has the cure.
Where's Kuryak right now? - I'll ping his cell.
got a GPS signal. He's in the East River.
Why's he going back to the island? He's going to clean up what's left of his mess.
Kuryak is on the island. Assume he's armed and dangerous.
go! Move! Move!
stay back! You gotta trust me.
you gotta believe me.
I'm here to help. - Shut up!
shut up! - But, no, look, when I found out what that maniac Hughes was doing...
using Sam to try and poison you kids...
you're lying. Sam would never hurt us. - I had to do something.
Kuryak, stop! Give it up!
they're trying to poison us! - Louisa, run.
al, she's got the vaccine and the virus. Don't let him go.
he's lying about Hughes. He's in on it!
all right, stay with them. Stay with them.
Louisa, come back! That medicine can help you!
Louisa! Louisa, wait!
I can't see a thing.
wait a second.
watch your step.
just stay with me, Al. Come this way.
be careful. There's a big hole here. Stay close to the wall.
it's right here. Stay up against the wall, okay?
this place is like a maze. Stay with me.
she's headed for the garden.
wait. No, it's... it's this way.
stay to the right.
I got it.
Louisa... - Stay back.
I'm just here to help, okay?
no, I have to destroy the poison.
no, no, no, look...
stay back! - Look, look... I am. Look at me.
that's not poison. What you have... right there...
is a cure that can save you and your friends. - No.
you're just like everyone else. Why are you trying to hurt us?
I'm not trying to hurt you. Look at me.
Louisa, I'm not like everyone else.
I'm not. You can trust me.
no... Why should I trust you?
because you and me, we're... we're a lot alike.
listen, I know what it's like to feel alone and different.
I do. I mean, I think you're brave.
I wish I'd been brave enough to find my own island to live on.
but they killed Sam. Yes, they killed Sam.
don't let them kill you, too. Sam would want you to live.
Louisa, look at me. Look at me.
I promise you that what you're holding in your hands is a cure that can save you and your friends.
please trust me.
please help us. Okay.
her viral levels plummeted once we started treatment.
Louisa and her friends are going to make a full recovery within weeks.
that's great. It's ironic, really.
the antiviral worked, but Hughes and Kuryak will never see the fruits of their labor.
you coming? No.
I'm gonna hang out here for a bit.
how are you feeling?
a little sore, I guess. But okay.
good. Is everyone else...
everyone's gonna be okay. It's gonna work out fine.
you know, you were really brave back there. You kept your word.
you saved us. I like to think Sam saved you.
if he hadn't left the island and tried to figure out what was going on, we would never have found you, you know?
Yeah.
Sam's watching out for you.
he always did.
get some rest, okay?
the CDC has the canister with the virus. It's completely contained.
great. What about Kuryak? He's lawyered up, but it's not gonna do him any good.
gunshot residue on his fingers matches Hughes' gun.
Kuryak shot him and made it look like a suicide.
he's going away for a long time. - Best news of all, - I don't have to deal with the Tourist Board anymore. - Oh, well, it's good to see you've got your priorities straight, Eliot.
eye on the prize.
what?
nothing. - What?
well...
what is it? - Oh, I was just thinking...
if I were heading to a deserted island, I'd take you.
that's sweet.
well, 'cause you'd be able to remember all the stuff I'd need to survive.
you're like a walking Swiss Army knife.
well, that's not... so sweet.
but, you know, if I... was headed to a deserted island, - I'd take something warm. - Yeah?
cause at nighttime it can get cold and I would need to...
heat up.
Yeah.
I'd take matches.
to make a fire. You know?
Yeah.
matches.
five ???
senator, um, as I've been saying... we're here for your protection.
and, as I have been saying...
I appreciate all the attention, but I don't believe I'm in any danger.
can I ask now, Granddad? You bet, Haley.
and you tell me if you think she's fooling.
go ahead, honey. Okay, June 3, 2003.
june 3, 2003, was a Tuesday.
george Bush landed in Egypt.
the baseball player Sammy Sosa was thrown out of a game for having cork in his bat.
and, let me guess... you were born.
you're right. She's right.
how'd you do that? Well, Haley, I have a very special gift...
I remember everything. Yeah, you might want to remember your job.
Oh. Just saying.
okay. All right.
nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too.
senator, Interpol and the NYPD are convinced you are a potential assassination target.
because why? I went to some silly conference?
hell, I only went for the skiing, you know. And it rained just about every day.
three other people who attended the Davos Conference... have been poisoned. Two died.
and Interpol believes the killer has entered the United States.
we just want to keep you safe. Right, Carrie?
Yes. Right.
we just want to keep you safe.
well, that is very kind of you, but I've been in public life for 30 years...
I'm tougher than I look.
believe me, my man Nolan can handle whatever situation arises.
Plus, I got that mean-looking fellow the festival's providing me gratis.
sir, we're talking about a professional assassin.
we don't know how he delivers the poison, but we know he does it under cover of large crowds.
fine.
you can do whatever it is you think you have to do since your dynamo partner here...
has so graciously entertained my granddaughter.
well, let's do this then, yeah? - Okay.
we're ready for you, Senator.
let me help you, sir. Thank you.
okay.
you know, you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.
you think I was just playing, but I had a whole master plan.
and, look at that, it worked. Mission accomplished.
how'd you know it was her birthday? I'm brilliant.
Jay, we're on the move. What's your situation?
well, place is really filling up. It's clear from here.
I wish I knew what we were looking for. Interpol and Homeland don't know much more.
whoever these guys are, they move like shadows.
Ah, Senator Carlyle. I'm Murphy Cloonan. So pleased you could make it.
so, this is the check I'll be presenting on behalf of your foundation.
fine, fine.
is there anything in particular you'd like me to say in your introduction?
Nope, just make it quick.
I'll cover the other side. - All right.
let's do it. - Okay.
all right.
Murray... anything out of the ordinary, abort.
no "wait and see." We make the call.
it's all good.
ladies and gentlemen, it is my great honor and pleasure to bring to the stage now a former member of the Senate, a true captain of business, the guiding light of the Carlyle Foundation, and an all-around great American...
senator Thomas Carlyle.
thank you.
thank you. You're too kind.
let me help you sir. Thank you.
okay.
al, the water level.
Hey, you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine.
Oh, my...
okay, our dead suspect is Nikos Hastis...
low-level operative out of Cyprus, rumored to have ties to "Revolutionary Struggle," a terrorist group.
how'd he get in the country? Came here on a work visa.
now apparently this guy's done private security jobs all over the world. Speaking of security...
we found the security guard he switched out at the festival, throat cut, in a Dumpster.
how does all this sync up with the previous attacks?
well, both Jean-Marc Keller, a Swiss banker, and Gustave Bauchau, Belgian manufacturing big shot, attended the Davos Economic Conference, along with Senator Carlyle.
both of them died very uncomfortably. No positive I.D. of the toxins used.
there were thousands of people at that conference.
still, it's the only link we got so far.
but it's the same M. O... poison, big crowd to cover the identity of the killer, and by the time these guys found out they were dosed, it was too late to do anything about it.
let's see if we can track Nikos's movements and tie him to the prior murders.
and let's find out how he was spending his time in New York.
I want to make sure he didn't offer a bottle of water to anyone else before we caught up to him.
you got it.
nice work this morning. Next time I need a body guard, I'm calling you.
next time? Wha... ?
was there ever a time? Oh, long time ago.
I was teaching a seminar at Columbia, and I had the nephew of a certain Uruguayan dictator in my class...
Ooh, did someone try to kill him?
No! No, no, no.
nothing like that. He was absent all the time.
tanked the final. I had to give him a "D.
so, he tried to kill you? No, but his uncle was pretty mad.
you probably dashed his hopes of ever going to medical school.
hardly... it was the culinary arts school. It was "The Essentials of Puff Pastry.
I let him take a make-up. He made an incredible rustico lecesse.
got a B-minus. He's now running a four-star restaurant in Montevideo.
Oh, wow. - His uncle sent me an amazing bottle of Grappamiel.
speaking of which, you look hung over.
well, I'm... I'm not.
sorry. Where are we... on the water bottle?
okay.
I found definite traces of aconite, otherwise known as wolfsbane.
it presents in a fever and slight nausea.
and just when you think you're ready to go to the hospital, after about 24 hours... boom, you're dead.
complete systems failure.
hard to come by? - Very.
the extraction process is highly complex, so...
your guy must have had a pretty sophisticated knowledge of chemistry.
that's what's bothering me.
Nikos Hastis was a career thug, not a brilliant chemist.
so, you're thinking there's someone else out there? Yeah, I do.
I talked to the desk clerk, not much.
Nikos checked in a couple days ago, registered under his own name... pretty ballsy.
Yeah, he never expected to get caught.
hmm. This is weird.
Koban Imports.
looks like he had these uniforms made outside the country.
fake papers. But where's the chemistry equipment?
according to Webster, the wolfsbane required elaborate preparation.
maybe he had a lab somewhere else. Al, I'm with Carrie.
this just doesn't feel like our guy.
Jay... do me a favor? What you got on Koban Imports?
hold on one second, Al.
all right, it looks like they're over in Long Island City.
been in business since 1995.
owners are Elizabeth and Eric Koban. Says here they live on the premises as well.
whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a second.
this is a little weird, Al. I just got an EMS alert.
ambulance has been dispatched to that location.
Murray, let's go.
Koban IMPORTS
I... I couldn't get her to wake up.
how could this happen? I... I don't understand.
Liz was stressed about something, so, she wanted to relax while I finished dinner.
any idea what was bothering her? No.
I mean, times are hard right now. We were having trouble making ends meet.
but things seemed to be getting a little better.
she, uh, poured a glass of wine, and went into the living room.
how long before you checked on her? About 45 minutes?
I thought she was just asleep.
I did everything I could... I called 911.
the ambulance came, they said they couldn't do anything.
that bottle of wine, you said it was delivered? From the wine store.
it came just like that, with a ribbon and a thank you card... no name.
I don't understand... what does that have to do...
do you know what time it was delivered? - About 4: 00.
would someone please tell me what's going on? After Nikos was dead.
Mr. Koban, we think your wife may have been poisoned.
you recognize this man? No.
I don't understand... why would someone want to kill my wife?
we don't know, but we're gonna find out.
diabolical.
he took a hypodermic needle, injected the poison through the cork.
there's no way that hole could be seen by the naked eye.
what kind of poison did he use? A venom... tetrodotoxin.
puffer fish. - Yeah.
I know my sushi. A much faster-acting poison than the others.
I finally contacted the M. E.'s in Switzerland and Belgium, he used dimethylmercury in one, and polonium in the other.
that's quite an arsenal, huh? Hmm... Elizabeth Koban...
had nothing to do with Davos. No, but she did help him, um...
... import the uniforms, right? So...
are you okay? I... I'm feeling a little off.
you look awful.
Oh, Carrie. You're burning up.
how long have you felt this way?
I started feeling... crappy this afternoon, and it feels like...
it feels like it's getting worse.
since the chase.
since the chase.
Carrie, is it possible you were poisoned?
I...
okay, so what do we do? Well, as Dr. Miller was saying...
we have to find out how she was poisoned.
exactly, the surest path to saving your life is finding the person who poisoned you and identifying the toxins he used.
okay, then let's get going.
you can't work your own case. You need rest.
I'm too pissed off to rest.
besides, weirdly, I feel fine right now.
detective Wells, depending on the poison and the dosage, you'll feel strong, and then weak, and then strong again;
but, untreated, this process will continue on and off until, well, without warning, you'll experience complete systemic shutdown.
Wow. Well, that doesn't sound like much fun, does it?
you know what? While I'm still feeling strong,
I'm gonna head out and save my life, okay? Thanks for racing over, Phil.
Carrie, where do you think you're going? To catch my murderer.
I told her she needs to be in a hospital. - Carrie,
Dr. Miller is the head of toxicology at Mt. Sinai.
if he believes you should be admitted, you should be admitted.
Oh, really? So, you want me to just lay in a hospital bed and die?
I'm going to die anyway, so I may as well go out while... Shut up and just listen...
with all due respect, knowing her the way I do, the way we all do, there's no way she's staying in a hospital bed right now.
right. - You need to be under a doctor's close supervision.
Oh. Joanne Webster's a doctor. Not a "doctor" doctor, more of a dead person's doctor.
but a doctor nonetheless, and I like her. And she makes me laugh.
will you supervise me? Yes.
supervised. Burns.
Carrie. I'm working this.
let me do it... you can't risk it.
listen to me. Listen to me, okay?
if you'd been poisoned, and you had maybe less than two days to live, who would you want working the case?
you. - And you.
you and me together, we can solve anything, right?
and if we work fast enough, then... then we can solve this.
I'll let you know if it gets to be too much, I promise.
but right now, we're the only chance I've got, Al.
what do you have?
okay, so back at the Bureau, my team had numerous cases where victims belonged to several overlapping groups.
so, we developed our own algorithm to narrow the focus, - which I kind of borrowed on the way out. - It's pretty cool.
I'm sure it is, but we already know the connection... the Davos Conference.
Yeah, I thought so, too. But then we widened our search.
and we located five other unexplained, sudden deaths... all potential poisonings.
shimon Furst, Israeli banker... died last year in a Tel Aviv hospital.
next we've got Roland Mercure, French real estate mogul... died six months ago.
and Nigel Adams, presumed victim of a cardiac infection three months ago in London.
thing is, none of these guys were at Davos.
but they were, along with our other victims, investors in...
linear Oil Systems. It's a small international refinery.
they were in the news for a pipeline spill in Nigeria two years ago.
destroyed thousands of acres.
every one of our victims, plus these three guys, helped finance that project.
davos isn't the connection. Linear Oil Systems is.
and Carrie and Elizabeth Koban just got in the way.
Carrie was right on Nikos's tail, I get bringing her down.
but why Koban? He used her to bring in those security uniforms.
maybe she got nosey. All right, get on Koban Imports...
bank statements, business receipts, everything.
he killed her for a reason, let's find out what it was.
and I want to know more about that oil spill.
something bad like that happens, it creates a lot of resentment and motive.
your heart rate is still elevated, your white blood cells are through the roof.
your body is fighting this, but any strenuous activity is just gonna make things worse.
Carrie, you know I'm not mushy, but you matter to me.
I want you to take care of yourself.
then help me fight, okay? Let's just...
we gotta figure this out. We gotta... we gotta... walk it through and figure it out, all right?
I was chasing Nikos Hastis.
somehow I must have gotten poisoned...
during the chase.
but the question is when. And how.
I just... The first moment...
could have been when I knocked the water bottle out of Carlyle's hand.
but that water never touched me. There were so many people there, I just...
if Nikos did have a partner, and he was in the crowd...
is it possible he stuck me with a needle, some kind of needle?
if he was trained in the Balkans, they... they sometimes use tiny needles in pens, so... yeah, it's possible.
all right, wait a second. There were these, um...
... curtains, these big, heavy, black curtains.
and they were covered in dust. He made a point of pulling them down on top of me.
and I was choking on the dust, but then he would have...
he would have had to have prepared them in advance, right?
Yeah, and airborne toxins are not really this guy's thing.
wait a second.
there was a cleaning guy that came out of nowhere.
Hey. You okay?
I... I slipped, and I fell.
maybe something got on me?
was there a smell? Anything unusual.
Yeah, there... like a... a... burning smell.
sulfur. - Yeah.
that could be it. What did he look like?
I know I looked at him, but...
... I don't think I saw his face.
I... I don't, I don't think I've got what we need.
it could be just enough.
it's waterborne, sulfur-based.
it's a good start. Okay.
so, where are we on that maintenance guy?
do I have a milk mustache on my face? Because I keep telling my guy, Jerry, to make my cappuccino dry, but he makes it wet with extra foam.
so, Jay, the maintenance guy.
uh, yeah. Sure. Sorry.
all right, listen. I know I'm a zombie, but I don't smell, yet, do I?
we're all just concerned, that's all.
I know, I'm concerned, too. But I just...
well, you look so sad. Let's just get this out, okay?
there's something you want to tell me, Jay.
just go ahead. What?
I don't want you to die.
cause you still owe me that 50 bucks from fantasy football last year.
well, I... I don't want to die, either, because...
I still haven't taught you how to count cards.
right. And on the maintenance guy...
the venue's got no record of anyone working the festival.
we're still on it.
all right. Hey.
okay.
so, I was going over the financial records for Koban Imports.
they've been struggling.
but it turns out they got two rather large deposits in the past month.
both cash, just under $10, 000... so it wasn't reported to the IRS.
you think they came from Nikos?
Yeah, but that seems like way too much money for fake security uniforms, huh?
but not for something a little more lethal. And if our guy still needs that something back...
I had a couple of unis hang out to keep an eye on things. We need to get over there.
911. - Lieutenant Burns, Major Crimes, requesting a 10-13.
officer shot at 1216 163rd Street.
there was a car right here.
a rental. You got the plate?
uh, I... I... I didn't... I didn't see it.
Yeah, you did. You looked right at it when we came in.
it was red, four-door. You got anything?
the make and model?
I... I can't remember.
business was closed for obvious reasons.
Eric Koban was at the funeral home, making arrangements for Elizabeth.
so, the killer returns to get reloaded, or clear out his stash, and finds our guys.
Koban confirmed that his wife mentioned leasing these lockers, but she didn't say to whom, and no paperwork was filled out.
strictly a cash under-the-table offer, I imagine.
and then she opens one, doesn't like what she finds, confronts him.
and that's what gets her killed.
when I catch this guy, there's no telling what I'm gonna do to him.
check with the CSUs one last time... see if they turned up anything else.
you got it.
Jo, what do we got?
Oh, a Pandora's box of poisons, illegal chemicals.
there are two boxes of spiders in there. This guy really liked to mix things up.
can any of this help Carrie? 'Cause I need something here, Jo.
Yes, actually it can.
whatever was used on Carrie is almost definitely in one of those boxes.
plus the fact that we now know it was a neurotoxin. Because of her memory?
Yeah, bad news for her, but it might just be the thing that saves her life.
I need you to tell me the truth. What's about to happen?
neurotoxins attack the brain. Each one does it differently.
she's obviously weaker, plus the memory loss, which is particularly cruel in her case.
she may have seizures. But there's no way to predict any of this stuff.
we need to do something for her. Well, I will take care of what's in there.
you just make sure that she slows down and maybe the poison will slow down, too.
Hey. - You all right?
listen. What if, um...
what if I just pulled the car out and we drove away?
Really? Pick up a bottle of wine.
get that bread you like, with the cheese.
we could head down to the water and...
pretend.
Yeah. Maybe.
that'd be nice.
let someone else be cops for a while. You've done enough.
give Jo time to find the antidote, let us all take over.
what if she doesn't? What if she doesn't find an antidote?
and anyway, when have I ever slowed down? I'm not slowing down.
one of two things is gonna happen here.
I'm gonna keep going, until, to quote that incredibly optimistic Dr. Miller,
I either drop dead or I'm gonna solve this.
I've never really been scared of anything in my...
in my whole life, but this?
I am scared of this. I'm not scared of dying.
I'm scared of losing my memory.
because without it, I... Carrie...
you are so much more than your gift. Don't you know that?
tell me you got something.
I think I do. Take a look, Al.
okay, so you know how we think Nikos was targeting Linear Oil Systems and their investors because of the oil spill?
right? I've been sifting through CCTV footage from their offices.
turns out there was a "Save Nigeria" rally right in front of the office about a month ago.
guess who I found?
the guy standing to the left of Nikos is a Nigerian national.
his name is Goodacre Oyenusi. Now, apparently, this guy's a notorious operator.
specializes in fake passports, immigration papers...
just like the ones Nikos had in his hotel room.
he likes to spend his days hanging around this Nigerian restaurant called Moin Moin.
shoot the address to my phone. Nice work, Jay!
you feeling all right?
never better. - You don't look so hot.
Oh, yeah, well, that's the crappy fluorescent lighting in here.
what about our deal? You're supposed to tell me when you don't feel good.
you know, I... I... I think I'm losing my memory and I don't really recall that.
Yeah, that's convenient.
you see what I'm seeing? Yeah, that's Oyenusi.
thinking the softer approach is better here.
Yeah. I completely agree.
police! Don't move!
I dare you to test me. I dare you.
sit your ass down and stay there. Al... behind that curtain.
I'm guessing it's not the Wizard of Oz. How's the soup?
tasty. All right, let's see.
we got fake driver's licenses, birth certificates from Qatar, blank social security cards...
that has nothing to do with me. Show me your pockets. Now!
Oh, look at that. An expired work visa for Carmen Naji.
I don't know anything about that. Let's go.
what do you know of Ogoniland? Nothing.
but I know you're a coward. You don't know me.
you know nothing about me. Ah, she looks terrible.
I'm not liking this. Not at all.
if a giant U. S. corporation came in and destroyed my family and my home,
I'd want to do something about it.
like murder? If you want to confess, I got a pen.
okay.
write this down:
if I could,
I would strangle you and all the others who come to my country and seduce my people with money and false promises.
you're not a patriot.
you think you are, but you're not. You're a crook.
you sell fake documents, you prey on poor people... you're sick.
if you're looking for "sick,
look in the mirror.
you are a disease.
a poison. What did you say?
did you do this to me? Al...
I'm on it. There are always your kind...
my kind? Secret police who don't wear uniforms, who hide behind names like "corporate protection" and "security forces.
you're all the same. Security forces don't...
I saw him.
I saw his face.
take it easy.
what happened? You fainted.
EMTs gave you something to stabilize your blood pressure.
how do you feel? Uh... I feel like an idiot.
for fainting. Where's Goodacre?
being booked on forgery and fraud. He's a crook, but he's not our guy.
how long was I out? About ten minutes.
I was going to put Triscuits on your forehead, like at New Year's that time.
we gotta...
we... we gotta get going, because I... I...
I saw his face. You remember the guy?
Yeah, I saw his face.
something Goodacre said, I... I saw him when I was chasing Nikos.
I know I saw him. It's okay.
no, no, no, no, it's not okay.
it's not okay, because I...
I saw him and I can't remember him.
and that thing you just said about Triscuits at New Year's,
I don't even know what you're talking about.
I don't remember it. Carrie... it's gonna be okay.
Homobatrachotoxin. What?
extremely rare. Amazonian hunters tip their arrows in it.
our guy must have had it on the cart.
I put Dr. Miller on it and I think we've come up with an antidote.
this is good. - We have no idea how much of that stuff you absorbed.
and the poison is so rare... Ooh, that's a big needle.
Yeah. - Ooh, okay. Okay.
how long till it takes to work? - An hour, maybe two, but there really is no data on the antidote, so...
you may feel worse before you feel better.
if I wake up tomorrow, we know it worked, right?
Carrie. I don't care if we catch him.
I do.
no more jokes, no more dodges, no more walking out of rooms.
I lost you before, for nine years. ALLTHESE the job, the city...
... all of it.
if you're not in it, it's meaningless.
please... let me take you to the hospital.
at least until we know the antidote is working.
I have to know I did my best for you.
you've always done your best for me.
and taking me to the hospital won't prove that.
Hey, guys.
you want a room, or, uh... you want to catch a killer?
since your memory's gotten a little shaky,
I've been trying to come up with my own version of what you do.
so I went back to the Goodacre interview, and I looked at what motivated you to turn and head for the door.
you guys were talking about private military contractors.
so I did a search of PMC's in that region of Nigeria during the time of the oil spill.
this is what I found. It's Custom Forces!
I... I saw a...
no, I can't remember.
they were in charge of the security on the Linear Oil Systems Nigerian project.
look who's on their board.
so, all our victims were on Custom Forces' board of directors.
exactly. And besides Senator Carlyle, there's only one member that's still alive.
the Honorable Logan Sale, retired.
this guy's the chairman of the board, and he only comes to town and goes to his office one day out of the month.
and it's today.
my arm is killing me. That a symptom?
no. Did you see the size of that needle?
I understand your concern. You bet I was worried.
everybody in our circle is. - No offense.
but we're running out of time on this.
I need you to tell us everything you know about the Custom Forces board.
rarely meets. Nothing controversial in the work we do.
except for the Linear Oil Systems disaster, right? That wasn't our problem.
we protect sensitive locations all over the world.
we neither condemn nor condone what goes on in those locations.
now I think I'm gonna be sick. This is why we keep the work we do hidden.
it's misunderstood.
are you okay?
Yeah. I just need to get some water or something.
uh... do you... ? Where's the ladies' room?
to the right as you go out the door. Thanks.
excuse me.
I'm going with you. What?
no, Al. Come on.
I think I'm old enough to go pee-pee by myself. Not like this you're not.
all right, listen. This isn't Cavanaugh's.
and it's not a Tuesday night. You remember Cavanaugh's?
Yeah.
I do.
after Truth or Dare, we, uh, we went to the bathroom and we made out.
boy, we really... we really made out.
it's working! The antidote.
what day was it?
summer.
it was summer? I'm going with you.
wait, wait, wait, wait.
june 13, 2000.
we forgot to lock the bathroom door.
and it didn't matter. - No.
all right.
I'm gonna go by myself.
okay. Hey?
you sure you don't want some company? Maybe after this is over.
it's a date. Yeah.
you know, now that you bring it up, there was one thing tied to the Nigerian operation that was odd.
we had to fire our top supervisor in the field.
and he didn't take it very well.
august Kincaid, former CIA.
old-school spook, full of himself, but very effective.
he just lost control one too many times, especially in and around the Nigerian situation, so we had to fire him. He was belligerent and upset.
the... the job was his entire life. It was like we took everything from him.
not healthy.
so this isn't about an oil spill or Nigeria at all.
this is about a guy with a grudge.
a very dangerous guy with a grudge.
okay.
Hello?
how you doing?
I'm good. I'm fine. Thanks.
you know you're in the men's room, right? - Yeah.
didn't make it to the ladies' room. Sorry.
little hung over?
no. No.
something you ate? Listen, I'm a...
sandwich vendor on this floor. I got a bottle of seltzer in my cooler.
I don't think seltzer's gonna fix what I got.
but thanks. You know?
you look familiar.
have we met?
I don't think so. No.
no, I'm... I'm pretty sure.
I mean, a lady like you makes an impression.
are you hitting on me while I'm about to throw up in a sink in a men's bathroom?
are you really... ? are... are you hitting on me?
come on, man, that's... - Sorry.
sorry.
at least let me get you a bottle of water. I'm really, I'm fine.
no problem at all.
important to keep yourself hydrated.
Yeah.
Ooh. Number one cure for what ails you.
you okay?
Hey, you okay?
Oh, come on now.
you're playing me? In your condition?
bad luck for you.
I didn't mean to dose you, but what could I do?
you should've let my partner go.
you're done, Kincaid.
who are you?
Carrie. It's me... Al.
got you.
????
so, they are gonna keep you overnight.
just to be sure. That sucks!
they don't even have Jell-O.
jell -O? - Yeah.
it's a long story. Well, the short version is that when I was a girl, my mom had appendicitis, they put her in the hospital, and every night they would give her these, you know, these little packages of Jell-O.
and I would steal them. And I would eat them.
and basically it became a lifelong craving.
Mm-hmm. I never knew that about you.
well... some of the most sacred memories, it takes a while to reveal them even to the person you love.
you know, with kisses like that I'm really glad I didn't lose my memory.
because I will be able to play that in my head over and over.
no, no, what are you still doing here? We're headed over to Alonzo's.
just updating some new protocols.
Jay, we caught an international assassin and Carrie is still alive.
you can go home early today.
you talk to Al? How's she doing?
she's doing good. That was a close one, huh, boss?
close enough for a beer. On me.
okay. Hold on... foreign or domestic?
let's go.
okay.
that's foreign and domestic? 'Cause a beer is a different thing.
excuse me, I'm looking for Detective Wells. Uh, well, I'm her boss.
how can I help you? - Oh, pleased to meet you. Eddie Martin.
I'm her husband.
look what I got.
no, no, where'd you get this?
I told 'em I got a girl upstairs needs her Jell-O ASAP.
I pulled the badge.
you did not. Did you?
I did not. I went across the street to the deli.
you're very sweet, you know that?
well, I didn't want the moment to slip away.
moment's not going anywhere.
to the moments. All of them.
want to see this? Choking on Jell-O?
can't choke, here... No...
you... will you do one shot of it?
what do you mean... No, you got to suck it.
Oh! God
who are you?
who the fuck are you?
[Jackhammer Running] - Hello?
[Man] Hey, big boy. Woz?
Woz?
he's in the john. - What?
brockman? Brockman, is that
why aren't you answer in the cell? Everything cool out there?
Yeah, it's, uh- [Clears Throat]
it's broken. Uh, we're fine.
what? I can't hear you.
I said we're fine. - Good.
[Man] Snakeskin wants to know if he left his piece out there.
a Glock? - Where?
I don't know. In the desk.
just a second.
Yeah, it's here. - Would you speak up? I can't hear you.
I said it's here.
Yeah, I knew it. I told the fucking guy it was out there.
I don't know what his problem is.
how's Coles?
he's fine.
so, how long before you get back?
aren't you a little antsy?
who knows? Maybe- I don't know. Maybe a couple hours.
we'll call you when it goes down. And, Brockman...
don't go finishing things up there till we're all done on our end.
Yep. - All right. I'm out of here.
the cops are all over us. - [Hangs Up]
[Man] What's she doing?
[Man On Radio] Molina, we've got a problem.
ms. Coles. - I know.
you're only supposed to come in here if something went wrong. - I couldn't. I just
Molina. - She's fine, Captain.
you've got to get her in there. Understand?
[Beeps] - Full signal.
[Captain On Radio] Curtis, you got a clean signal? - It's all good on this end.
okay, Ms. Coles. It's time.
number 52.
all you gotta do is put it in and walk away. That's all.
they kidnapped my husband from his own building.
I just can't imagine what else they're capable of...
what else they might do when
ms. Coles, if they come within five feet of you, we'll be all over 'em.
it's not taking this money to them that scares me. It's what happens once I let go.
what happens to Bill then?
we won't let them get away.
just bring my husband back, Detective.
he's all I have.
what? - Talk to me. Talk to me. Talk to me right now. Hey.
tell me what happened. - I don't know what happened. [Groans]
tell me what happened right now! - I don't remember.
tell me what you know! - Did you do this to me?
tell me what happened right now, goddamn it! - Don't hit me anymore!
what's the last thing you remember?
I don't know. Me waking up. You smacking me around.
please untie me.
w-where are we? What is this place?
the desert. - Desert?
that much I do know.
are they dead? - No.
well, it's gonna get real ugly when these guys wake up. You better untie me.
[Coughs] I wouldn't do that if I were you.
where the fuck did this guy come from? - [Coughing]
don't listen to him. Hey, butt out! Mind your own business!
me and my friend, we got this straightened out. We don't need your help.
really. Don't untie him, man.
and why not? What the hell do you know?
he's tied up and we're not. Right?
that's brilliant. This guy doesn't know anything either.
just think about it for a second, would you? Somebody did this.
you know? And it makes sense that they did it for a reason, right?
Yeah. And what reason is that?
it's obvious, isn't it? Whatever side we're on, it sure as hell ain't his.
what side? What are you talking about?
we're not on sides. This isn't teams.
we're all in this together! Period!
okay. You got me.
so, how the hell did we get here?
I don't know.
Yeah. - [Captain] Mc Gahey, Anderson, stand by. She's coming out.
everyone, hold position. Curtis, tell me when that thing moves.
Oh, shit. What the hell happened to him?
he's been shot. He's lost a hell of a lot of blood too. Take these.
go up top and see if you can unlock him.
no. These are too big. These are car keys.
shit. - You're gonna let him go and not me?
Hey, the man's been shot, so shut up.
so maybe I'm a doctor. I'm hurting too.
is there a bathroom here? - It's right down that way.
what's your name? - I don't- I don't know.
you don't remember anything?
[gasping] I'm gonna die, aren't I?
I'm gonna die.
what the hell is going on here? - [Gunshot]
is he okay?
I can't help him unless I find a key. I'm gonna check this guy.
get away! Get away! - Hey, hey, hey! Watch it!
[Groaning] Okay! Okay!
what did you have to go and do that for?
you attacked me. I was just trying to help. - [Coughs] Help, huh?
who asked you? - Not you, asshole. Him.
thought you might have the keys to the cuffs.
listen. Listen. Whoa. Hold- Hold on.
it's important you tell us what you know.
I don't have to tell you shit. - You remember anything?
[Bound Man] Do you remember- Do you know who the fuck you are? Say something!
of course I do. - What do you remember then?
this guy did this to us! That's what I remember! He did this!
Hey, hey. I didn't do anything to anybody.
you broke my fucking nose is what you did.
Oh, you remember that? You actually remember that?
Yeah. Yeah, I remember. Now get off my case. - Okay, what's your name then?
my name? Fuck your mother. That's my name.
go wash up. You don't remember jack shit.
you'll remember my boot up your ass in about 10 seconds.
what the hell is this place, huh? Where the hell are we?
maybe you fucking asses will remember to pick me up!
guys! Hey! Hey!
whoa. This canister's busted open. I think it fell from up there.
you think that's what caused us all to be like this?
maybe. [Sniffs]
Hey, stop getting high on that shit and untie me!
we all inhaled way more than that little sniff you just got. Let me ask you this.
why would you put up bars on all these windows...
have a high-tech door lock in this shit hole of a place?
somebody's obviously gone to a lot of expense to secure this.
something either very dangerous or very valuable in here.
there, with the trash can. Is he one of yours?
I'm not sure. We contract out most maintenance. - Find out.
what the- Come on, honey. Come on.
[Sighs] It's gone, Captain. The signal's gone.
[Captain] What do you mean gone? He hasn't done anything.
Anderson, what's going on out there? Break silence. Talk to me.
nothing here, Captain.
McGahey, can you tell? - Nothing, Captain.
all right. It's a go. Stop him.
anything? - Nothing.
[whistles] Keys. - Captain, what's goin'on?
he's one of ours. His name's Frank Gilroy. He's not all there.
[Captain On Radio] Anderson, ease up. He works here.
affirmative. - Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Shit!
captain, it's a false bottom. Must open up to the basement.
basement? - We're on it. Go, go, go!
Hey, look at me. Look at me.
why were you standing in front of this locker?
big man told me, Frank, I could get $20.
captain, we've located the bag.
check that corridor. Check that one.
captain, the bag's empty.
check that fucking corridor! Secure that stairwell!
[Grunts] You try all the windows?
they're all barred.
all of them? - Yep.
that's the only door.
[Grunts] - Sorry.
okay.
sorry. - Okay.
fuck!
[Gasps] Son of a bitch. Ow.
big disappointment, huh?
piss off.
does the name Coles mean anything to you?
Nope. - How about Woz?
look, nothing means anything to me right now, all right?
I remember being in that room.
then I remember just walking in here. Other than that...
it's like I landed in a fucking Alzheimer's ward.
what about you? Huh?
it's all of us.
that's too bad.
wash your hands. Oh.
won't open. I already checked it. - [Keypad Beeping]
all right. So, let's go over this again. You woke up
I saw you guys. There was blood on the shovel. There was blood everywhere.
a broken cell phone. I just freaked out and headed for the door.
you didn't move anything. You didn't see nothing else? - No.
anything suspicious or odd?
I saw two chairs back to back in the storeroom with rope around it.
well, that's interesting.
well, obviously, whatever went down here didn't go down as planned, right?
trapped like fuckin' rats. - [Rancher Shirt] So that's it? That's everything?
Yep. Pretty much.
Hey. Ask him about the phone call.
what?
ask him... about the phone call.
[Rancher Shirt] What? What phone call?
there's a phone in here? - Um, listen
when you guys were still passed out...
he went to answer the phone. - Where's the phone?
listen, I was gonna tell you- - Just-Just tell me who was on the phone.
I don't know. Some guy.
that's funny that you forgot to mention that little tidbit. - Some guy. Who? What?
I- I don't know. He just started talking.
so he recognized your voice then? - No. I don't think so.
I mean, it was noisy on his end. It was construction or something.
whose side are you on any, man?
wait a minute. You think I'm with them?
he talked to you. He recognized your voice, right?
let's tie this motherfucker up. - Yeah.
wait a minute. I picked up the phone.
the caller asked if I was so-and-so. I said, " No, so-and-so's in the john.
then he asked if I was someone else. I didn't know what to say, so I just changed the subject.
bullshit! - What was I supposed to say?
Hey, buddy, I can't remember jack shit. Could you please tell me what's going on?
we've all beaten the hell out of each other here and fried our brains in the process.
does that make any sense to you? - Think about it.
he talked to you. He recognized your voice, man.
he didn't know who I was. He asked if I was two different people.
he didn't know. I'm not on the caller's side.
well, somebody in here's gotta be.
[Curtis On Radio] Captain, it's back. - What?
the tracking signal- it's back. It's headed due east from our location.
what's the signal strength on that thing?
it'll hold for about two miles. - All right. Start putting a tail on it.
captain, I saw one of the guys.
who? - One of the pickup guys walked right past me.
can you I. D. Him? - Yeah. Yes, sir.
[Captain On Radio] Curtis, hold on. Anderson's coming with you.
they're headed toward the interstate.
I got a good look at one of'em. - Did you?
promise me next time you'll do more than just look.
come on. Let's make the call.
no, no. We all agreed. He gets back here. We all make the call together.
Hey, let's go!
[Broken Nose] Hey!
look. I found the fucking keys.
Yeah, you got keys and no car.
you got a holster and no gun and you got a cell phone in a million pieces downstairs.
it's making perfect sense, isn't it? - What can I say?
just relax, all right?
they're coming to kill us. - You don't know that.
what do you think they're digging out there, huh? They're putting a pool in?
what do you think you're doing? - Ordering a pizza.
give me the phone! - No!
what's the matter, pal? Huh?
you feeling a little guilty?
you wanna make a phone call? Go ahead. Dial 911.
go ahead. Yeah, you're innocent. - Yeah.
cause you know how you broke your nose, right? Sure. - I know what I know, okay?
[Handset Slams] - What the hell are you doing?
are you insane? That was our ticket out of here!
Yeah, it's our ticket, all right.
Oh, shit. A cop. It's a cop.
no. Security guard.
what have you fuckers got me into?
you barely looked at him. How do you know he's security?
it's right here. "L. P.W." Liberty Plaza West.
wait a second. Why does that sound so familiar? - Oh, shit.
what? - Shit.
'police are investigating the disappearance of William Coles Jr...
'of Coles Consolidated Equities, and the company's financial adviser, Richard McCain.
'while both men's cars were found in the parking structure...
'of their downtown corporate headquarters Monday morning...
'neither have been seen by family or coworkers since early Sunday morning.
police suspect the men have been abducted.
not seen since Sunday morning, and this is the Tuesday morning paper.
right. - So we've been here at least two days.
Coles and McCain.
that could be any one of us, right? - What else? Keep reading it.
'Witnesses report hearing gunshots in the area around midnight Sunday.
anything else? - He's got a wife. That's about it.
Oh. How are we gonna figure this out?
I got you pegged as Richard. You seem like a Dick to me.
that must make you the kidnapper, 'cause a tycoon could afford a pair of nuts.
yeah? - What?
two names, right? Two guys. - Two.
well, obviously, something went Haire down here.
okay, there was a struggle. McCain and Coles got loose from the back.
okay? Makes sense, right?
so either they were recaptured, which makes the three of us kidnappers
or one of us is Coles and one is McCain. - Exactly.
and the other guy? - Doesn't matter. We gotta work together till we get out.
he's right. - And then we go our separate ways.
they're probably coming back now. You thought of that? - Stop jumping to conclusions.
they get their money. They come back. We're fine.
you're assuming they're gonna get money! You're assuming somebody's gonna pay!
maybe nobody's gonna pay! Fuck me, we're dead!
what is wrong with you? Huh? - You're wrong.
they got blood on their hands.
whoever Coles is, whoever McCain is, they're dead men unless we get out of here.
[Gasps] God!
the bars are the way to go. They're all rusted out.
you're just gonna keep breakin' them. You're never gonna get through that.
all of a sudden you remember you're an architect, huh?
just- - Hey, hey!
go ahead.
[Bound Man] Girls, stop fighting. Could we get some water here?
shut up!
come on. A man's been shot!
if you want, you can untie me. I'll do it myself.
deaf or stupid?
eat me, hemlock.
all right. Let's give it a go.
we're gonna use the shovel and just
we're gonna pry it. Get some leverage on it.
no matter who anybody is here or how tough you think you are...
you'll always be the pussy that's tied up to an office chair.
all right? - [Grunts]
what are you looking at?
now, just because we're tied up doesn't mean we're friends.
what?
[Mouths Words] - What?
why didn't you say so? - Yeah.
ha ha! - [Rancher Shirt] What do you see?
[Broken Nose] There's nothing; - [Grunting]
help!
Hey, let's take it easy with that!
okay! Okay! - [Bound Man] Take it easy!
Hey, I thought it was gonna help. I wasn't gonna do nothing!
guess that settles it.
[Bound Man] I wasn't gonna do nothin;
I wasn't gonna do anything with that. I just thought
sure. - Hey, what are you doing?
that's more like it, chief. Now you're talking.
[Rancher Shirt] Christ, you're lettin'him go?
what- What are you doing?
[Groans] - Fuckin' asshole.
one less thing to worry about.
[Phone Rings] - Shh!
what the hell is that?
wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
let him answer it. Let him answer it.
let him do it. - Are you crazy?
if that's them, they bought his voice once. They'll do it again. Let him answer.
yeah? - [Man] Uh, it's me.
it's done. See you before sundown. - [Hangs up]
they're coming. - [Handset Clangs]
[Jean Jacket] Sundown.
Oh, shit.
half an hour. We barely made a dent.
Oh, that's the spirit there, cheese. Get me another blade.
he's right. We're not getting an here with this.
well, I don't know. We got, uh- We got two hours, right?
we're gonna have to decide how far we're prepared to take this.
what do you mean?
I mean, when they show up, are we all prepared to do whatever it takes?
give me another blade.
that was the last one.
[No Audible Dialogue] - [Molina] What do you want me to tell her?
I don't know.
just take her down to the station and keep her calm.
shit, look at this.
this is the same chemical name on that busted canister out there.
Oh, yeah? - Listen to this.
warning. Effects of inhalation or exposure include...
shortness of breath, nausea, unconsciousness...
temporary memory loss, seizure and/or death.
avoid breathing. Contact a physician. Infectious agent.
dire if exposed in large doses.
I mean, shit, how long have we been breathing this stuff in?
don't fucking move, McCain! I got a gun to your head!
mccain.
you know, I been thinking about this whole thing.
you wakin' up before everybody else.
the phone call.
[Grunts] - It's all pretty convenient.
you got something to say, go ahead and say it.
maybe you are just waiting for them to show up, huh?
what about you? Aren't you the one that ripped the phone jack out of the wall?
Yeah, but I didn't lie about it and try to cover it up, did I?
okay. Now, would you come on over and help me?
Shh! Listen. Listen. My memory's coming back.
I remember parts from before. I know who we are.
Oh, yeah. Why should I believe you?
because, Bill, you're the other hostage. You're William Coles.
Oh, really? Miracle cure you're having all of a sudden, huh?
they kidnapped us from work. Okay? We were finalizing a deal.
we were in a parking structure. Do you remember any of that?
no. - They took us on a Sunday. It was late afternoon.
we were running some numbers. That son of a bitch saw us go in. He saw us go in.
[Jean Jacket] Hey!
I know you have no reason to believe me, but he's setting us up.
geez. - So we gotta get that gun before that son of a bitch...
remembers who he is, otherwise we're screwed.
I don't remember shit, okay? I don't remember.
okay. For Christ's sake, you don't remember your own kids?
our kids play Little League together for Christ's sake, Bill.
you don't remember your own children?
bill.
what? What's wrong?
we need to talk.
what's goin' on?
kill him!
[Bound Man] Get that son of a bitch!
get him, get him, get him, get him! Get him!
get the gun! Get the gun!
[Bound Man] Get the gun!
fuck.
what the hell do you think you're doing?
he said I was Coles. He said I was Coles, man.
what? And you believed him?
he said his memory came back. He knows who we are.
he's a lying sack of shit!
he remembered my kids. My kids, man.
[Groans] - He's lying!
I couldn't risk it. I couldn't risk it!
is that true? What do you remember?
what do you remember, asshole?
he's gonna kill us, Bill.
[Panting] Fuck- Fuck you.
fuck me? No. Fuck you! - Don't!
what the hell is the matter with you? - Tell me who to shoot!
what the hell are you doin; man?
I lied.
what do you remember? - I made the whole thing up.
that's enough! - I'm just trying to get out of here, man.
just leave him alone. Just leave him alone, man.
I don't know what I'm doing here. I don't know what I'm doing here.
you're only saying that so I don't kill you.
you're gonna kill me anyway.
what do you remember?
you're the one. You're the one.
I'm not a criminal.
stop acting like one then.
[Curtis] We're in the middle of nowhere.
what? Speak! - I think they just pulled off.
don't think. Read the damn thing. You got a bead or not?
Yes. Right here. Go.
[McCain's Voice] This guy did this to us!
[Coles's Voice] Whose side are you on anyway, man? - [Lighter Cap Clicking]
[Coles] How are we gonna get up there?
[Coles] Go to the ledge! Go to the ledge quick! We're losing you!
I got it! I got it! - You on the ledge?
easy! - Oh, shit!
[Coles] Son of a bitch!
sorry.
goddamn it! Goddamn it!
fuck. [Grunts] - More security glass?
[Grunts] Hey, wait a second.
I may be able to shoot a hole in it. - No way, pal.
the gun stays with me.
don't be a prick. I'm trying to get us out of here.
I could shoot it at close range, right here.
you come down. I'll climb up there and shoot a hole in it myself.
you're too big, you fat fuck!
the rope may not hold you. Suit yourself.
okay, here we go.
now here's where your good look pays off.
that's him. That's him inside the store.
are you sure? - Yeah.
you see which car is his? - [Clicking]
[Anderson] I can't tell. - [Camera Clicks]
Oh, no. No, no. Come- Come on.
[Anderson] Shit.
fuck! He's gone. Which one?
I don't know. - Come on! Come on! Which one?
I don't know! They're all leaving at the same time!
[Curtis] Well, choose one. The Denali or the pickup?
right there. The pickup.
go, go, go!
[Groaning] - Come on!
how do we know you're not just gonna leave us here? - I guess you don't.
cut the shit! Cut the shit!
that's really funny.
Oops. - Asshole.
Oh, I hope you're dead, you clumsy fuck!
Hey. Hey. Hey, man, are you all right?
[McCain] Lucky to be alive.
of all the stupid things.
Hey. Hey. Hey, can you hear us?
are you all right? - Erin?
I think it's safe to say you were too heavy, huh?
[Mutters] - Fuck off.
my shoulder. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Shit. Whoa, whoa. Just wait.
Ah, man, your back is bad.
you do understand that was our only weapon.
back off! It was an accident, all right?
what's the matter with you? - You trust this guy? Huh?
Oh. I see what's going on here.
what, you two are gonna start working together now?
what the hell difference does it make?
is that gonna get us out of here any faster, huh?
I don't think so. - [Coles] What are you doing?
don't! Don't untie him!
you stay outta this. - We had an agreement!
Yeah. I'm hedging my bets.
Thanks.
you idiot.
it's you and me now.
[Coles] What's the matter with you? Fuck.
[Bound Man] You better stay in the garbage, 'cause I ain't through with you.
all right. This is gonna sting a bit. - [Grunts]
son of a bitch! - So who's Erin?
your wife?
or my daughter. I can't remember which.
at least you got somebody outside of this place.
you'll remember her soon enough. Soon as we get out of here, it'll all come back to you.
how can you be so sure we're gonna like what we have when we get out of this place?
I mean, what could have brought us all here that's worth remembering anyway?
nothing. That's exactly it. Nothin' we can remember here...
is gonna have anything to do with who we really are.
the choices we make from here on out of this shit hole
that's what's gonna define us.
you really believe that? - Yeah, man. I do.
shit.
I didn't want to say anything around those two other jokers, but... I know who we are.
you remember something? - Yeah.
about you and me?
Yeah. This smell. This smell for the longest time...
out there and then in here.
see? [Inhales]
I remember. I have orange trees. - You have orange trees.
Yeah, on my ranch. It's been in my family for generations. - Shit.
I'm Coles. - You're Coles then.
I'm William Coles. I really am.
he was right. - I think he was guessing.
I don't have kids. At least I don't think I do.
wait a minute. Why are you telling me this?
don't you see? You're McCain. - Me, McCain? No!
Yes. - You actually remember this?
I
our original terms that we proposed to you are more than fair.
you want this bid, you get back to me within an hour.
no. No, but you have to be McCain.
you have to be McCain. - What makes you so sure?
for whatever reason, you're the only one I feel like I can trust...
and if I can remember that, they're not far behind, so we gotta get out now.
what if you're wrong? - I'm not, okay? You're McCain.
it's the only thing that makes sense. - Fuck. I'm not McCain.
what? - I remember too.
what?
how could you do that?
humiliate me like a dog!
like a stinking fucking dog!
you tried to humiliate me! You see this? You see? - Get the hell off!
they were turning blue! - Get off me!
what's the matter with you? - How could you fucking do that?
you would have done the same thing.
you were the one with the gun!
Hey.
there's someone outside.
[Spanish Radio Announcer] - [Coles] Where is he?
[McCain] Right over there. See him? Behind the gate.
is it them?
[Coles] No, I don't think so. It's gotta be too soon.
Hey! - [McCain] Hey!
[McCain] Hey! Hey, you! Hey! Over here!
Hey! Hey!
[Coles] Over here! - [McCain] Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
back off. Let me try.
can you see anything? - [Radio Announcer Continues]
[Coles] Um, uh, move it around. Move it around.
[Coles] Whoa, whoa. What's that? - Holy shit. It's a kid.
[Pounding] - [McCain] Kid! Hey!
[Men] Hey! - He doesn't understand.
[Coles] He doesn't know what you're saying. He doesn't speak English.
what the hell? - [Spanish]
[Announcer Continues] - Ramon. Vamos.
[men Shouting] Hey! Hey!
[McCain] Go get your parents!
wait, wait, wait, look! He's going back! He's going back!
[McCain] You sure? - [Coles] Yeah. He's good. He's going to them.
[Coles] Yeah, he's getting in. Look at him!
[Pounding On Window] - [Coles] They're coming! Whoo-hoo!
you did it! [Laughs]
Whoo! Over here! Look over here!
no. No!
No! Help! Hey! No. Shit!
No! - Fuck it.
shit.
[Handcuffed Man] Hey, can I get some help up here?
here.
Thanks.
you know I'm not gonna be able to get those off.
thanks anyway.
you think I'm afraid of dying?
I'm not afraid of dying.
I didn't tell you to give up.
what's the E. T.A. On our backup?
at least 20 minutes away.
I'm over this. Let's crash.
police! Nobody move.
[Curtis] Where is he? - What's this?
I got nothing over here. You? - [Curtis] Clear!
got people back here? - [Anderson] No?
you see him? - No.
where is he? I said where is he?
[men Laughing] - [Curtis] Who owns the pickup?
you think if you keep talking they'll eventually understand?
the yellow pickup! - The yellow one is mine.
[Keys Jingle] - What about it?
how stupid do those guys think we are?
might have been born at night but not last night.
Hey, step on the gas.
let's pick up Leon and Ray and finish this up.
first the locker, now this.
Hey. - Fuckin' tracker.
[Coles] We gotta get that gun.
we already tried. - Not together, we haven't.
well, let's get the rope. I'll do it.
you guys had your chance to fuck this up. Let me. Maybe I can get it.
they're gonna be here any minute, all right?
so does it matter what we do? We can draw straws, whatever.
I'm sick of waiting for these bastards. I swear, I want 'em to come back.
and what are you gonna do? Whine until they surrender?
why don't you two shut up? - [Bound Man] Fuck you.
you're the moron that left the gun up there. - [Handcuffed Man] Hey.
I remember.
I remember.
I was seven and you were nine.
we- We wanted to go out on the lake one day with some friends.
you remember?
you know me?
my dad told us not to go...
because of the storm.
we said fuck him.
what did he know?
we went out in the old man's MacGregor 26...
and we got in some argument about...
who was the only pitcher to win M. V.P.
[Whispering] Sandy Kaufax.
and we argued so much about it...
that we didn't realize we couldn't see land anymore.
I was really fuckin' scared.
and I could see that you were- were too...
even- even though you kept talking like it would be okay.
and then this big wave came and-and turned us over.
I remember going down...
and being disoriented.
thinking if I couldn't find which way was up, I was gonna die for sure.
and then this hand
this hand reached down...
and grabbed me...
and pulled me up.
you must have seen how terrified I was.
you looked me in the eye...
and you told me not to give up.
no one was gonna die.
we all-all had to stick together...
and keep each other holding onto the boat.
that's what we did...
for four hours.
we hold on ...
just like you said.
Hey, that's really touching and all. [Laughs]
completely useless though.
enough with the boats, kid. Who are you?
just listen to what he's saying.
he's right. We gotta work together.
no, listen to what I'm saying.
if he knows who he is, then maybe he can tell us who we are.
it doesn't matter who we are!
cause they're gonna be back here any minute.
all right, we got one shot at this! - Hey, tell us who you are.
who are you, kid? Tell us. Tell us, kid. Kid!
sorry.
I don't know who the hell you are.
I don't care.
maybe you are a kidnapper. I don't know.
but you know what I think?
maybe somewhere along the line you just forgot who you were...
before you become one.
but regardless, we can't do this without you.
the plates aren't visible in any of these shots.
wait a minute. - What?
right here. In the reflection of the gas station window.
that's their front plates. - You upload that to Molina. Get a cleaner shot.
[Coles] Let me know. Let me know when it's coming.
it's coming. It's coming. - [Laughs]
wait. Let's just tip it. We tip it-Just pull down. Yeah.
there it is. - Oh! Whoo!
Where'd she go? - She said she needed some air.
coffee? - No, thank you.
Yeah. I can't drink any more either.
may I?
bill's father was completely self-made.
but before he had anything, he built this place up at Eagle Ridge.
beautiful place. Right there in the foothills.
burnt down a few years ago.
bill decided to...
rebuild it by hand just like his father.
he's one of the wealthiest men in the state, barely has time to breathe, but...
he had to do it, you know?
show himself he could.
must be nice for the two of you to have.
I mean, a place to get away to.
you should see the sunsets there.
only next time, we let it go from up there.
be sure you keep this door open when the shit goes down. - I'm on it.
you know how to use that thing, right? - Yeah.
great vantage point from up there.
you get out to that truck quick and get it started so we can get the hell outta here.
what's that?
it's Erin.
she's my daughter.
beautiful.
so there you go.
now you got something to fight for.
shit! Here they are!
merry Christmas.
dig a hole big enough for three people.
soon as they come in, let it go.
you got it? - Yeah, I got it.
captain, we got a partial on the plate that Anderson sent.
put it on the wire.
they can't be more than 40 miles from that gas station.
Hey, Ray. Call Ritter and make sure he's putting the plane down on time.
ray? - I know. I know. Back to the scanner.
Hey!
[Clangs] - Get the lights.
Woz! - Brockman.
[Whispers] Go! - [Man] Hey!
now! - Come on. I got some burgers for you guys.
shit. Where the fuck are you, assholes?
quit jerking each other off and let's go!
watch out!
Leon! Leon, it's me!
[Groans] - What the fuck?
you okay?
nobody move! Everybody down!
Coles, you move, you're dead.
hit me. - Get him down! Woz, get him down!
goddamn mess. What the fuck happened here?
you look like shit, Woz.
we got no prints on the 20 we got from the custodian...
and nothing yet on the A. P.B. We have on the vehicle.
I been working with this plate from Molina. I run it through the D. M. V. but it comes up dry.
I ran a state-wide search on all open investigations, and I got a hit.
it seems the narcotics task force down in San Diego's got an open investigation.
these kidnappers- they're meth dealers. They've got a rap sheet a mile long...
and they're suspected links to murders on both sides of the border.
this Stefan Burian is the ringleader.
get everything San Diego has on these guys. - I've already got a call in.
so that's it? That's all you've got to say?
it happened so fast. - You know, you been working for me...
for a couple months now, handling deals, collections...
all kinda tough shit.
babysitting two suits in there...
is what's too much for you to handle. - No, l- l
I fucked up.
you better pull your shit together, man.
this is far from over.
what did you do that for?
[Bound Man] What
Hey! Hey! Hey!
where you gonna run to, Coles? Come here!
Oh, shit.
better take him and the rest of ours out back.
takes talent to fuck it up so badly.
go and clean the shit up. Then we're heading out of here.
we kill them before we're free and clear...
the mess gets even bigger, right?
you don't have to kill them.
I'm not.
good.
you are.
[Erin] Here, Dad. - It's from both of us.
that's Erin. - [Man] Has she ever had a reaction to insulin before?
[Woz] I don't know. - [Man] Is her mother there? Anybody that can say
I'm divorced. I have no idea. - She's not breathing. We gotta get her inside.
God, baby.
that fucking lighter, Woz.
they've been gone for five years.
you either get over it...
or pick up smoking again.
go and finish them off.
take the fuckin' rent-a-cop with you too.
your cut will be here when you're done.
Hi. - Have a seat.
there's been a development.
do any of those men look familiar to you? Their names?
you ever recall seeing any of them...
with Mr. Coles? - No. Who are they?
these are the men who have your husband.
excuse me, Captain. Lieutenant James of Narcotics Task Force San Diego's on line one.
now who the hell is this?
did you get the keys to that truck?
we can't go for the truck.
I don't have the keys. - Doesn't matter. We still got a shot.
if we get up over the ridge, should be able to find the interstate.
you may be right. How many rounds you got left in the gun?
just keep moving this way.
[McCain] You guys can powwow all night. I'm gonna get outta here.
what the fuck are you doing? - Whoa!
Aw, shit. What's the matter with you? Put it down.
Oh, fuck me. - They want me to finish this. Then I get outta here.
what? - You see what's happening here?
you fucking-You fuck. So you are one of these pieces of shit, huh?
I tried to tell you! - For once in your life, shut up, all right?
if I don't kill you, they're gonna kill me. - Listen, you're not doing this.
it's not that simple. - What do you mean, it's not that simple? Of course it's that
was it that simple when you ripped that phone jack out?
guy was bleeding to death in the other room. You're saying you were only doing it for him?
what's the matter with you, man? We didn't do this!
you're only worried about yourself...
and the murder rap over this dead guard...
so don't start talking about simple, 'cause this whole thing couldn't be further from it.
we should be running now! Get out of this shit hole!
you don't get it, do you? This is it. - No, no, no.
this is who I am. - Bullshit. Put it down.
you turn around right now. - No, man. You want to kill me, do it to my face.
do it. - No, you do it. Show me who you are, huh?
do it!
is this how you want Erin to remember you?
I'll give you anything you want. Anything you want.
just fucking don't do it. Don't fucking do it!
my wife and my daughter are gone. Both fucking gone. - Don't fucking do this.
I just want this to end. - No!
this is Detective James Curtis.
[Woman] Detective Curtis, I've got Captain Parker on the line for you.
Curtis, a local worker and his son reported suspicious activity...
at a chemical warehouse off Blythe Road, 15 miles west of that gas station.
are you sure they check out, Captain?
listen. There's an undercover officer on the scene.
[ON Scanner] We don't know ifhis cover's been blown, ifhe's alive or ifhe's dead.
affirmative. We'll be there in five minutes. Tactical's 20 minutes out.
[Captain] 10-4. - You ready for this?
Yeah.
[Ray] Hey. - What?
we got a problem.
stay with the car. Keep it running.
Hey, you.
am I looking at a cop?
cop?
you worked so hard to make detective. - Here, Dad. See?
Hey. So you like this place?
Yeah. Keeps the money clean. Hey, you ready?
I'd tell you not to do something to make me look bad...
but then I know you'd just do something to piss me off.
well, if I didn't need the money so bad, I just might. - Hey, money's good.
[Chuckling] - It's good to have you back, you know?
it's like old times.
Where'd your friends go?
you double-crossing son of a bitch!
[McCain] Turn him around! Move!
look. There it is.
come on! - [Curtis] You wait for backup.
[Woz Coughing] - [Laughing] Where you going?
ain't over yet.
Oh, what the f
you saved my life.
you okay?
Yeah.
how's the arm? - It's all right.
this guy's been undercover for the last eight months.
his fucking command staff in San Diego hasn't talked to him in three weeks.
I don't know if I could do that.
it's gotta be instinct.
what, police work?
no. Surviving.
you guys should consider yourselves very lucky.
a few more minutes of exposure to those chemicals...
and you would have gone into full arrest, never woken up.
my memory- will it ever come back?
the human body can endure significant trauma, Detective.
for better or for worse, it'll all come back sooner or later.
[Woz] Okay.
[Officer] Captain.
[Mrs. Coles] You don't have to do this if you don't want to.
I just don't know of any other way that we can be together. What's stopping us, Detective?
celebration in advance. 'Cause I have a plan.
a plan that could see us all retired within the next two weeks.
Hey, you tell him yet? - Tell me what?
this is a mark worth millions. No security on corporate insurance.
that'll cover getting him back fast, no matter what the price.
[Mrs. Coles] With the prenup we have, there's just no other way.
I want them all dead and the trail leading to McCain.
if something goes wrong- - It won't.
but if it does?
then we'll just do what we have to do.
[Medic] Hey. You okay? - Yeah.
I'm fine.
captain.
I think you're lookin' for this.
[Coles] There's someone I want you to meet.
can I trouble you for a cigarette?
I don't smoke.
wouldn't be lying to me, now, would you?
and if I were?
and the temperature is a cool minus four degrees.
morning.
did you sleep?
no. I'll sleep at the hotel.
you'll do great.
you always do.
what's the purpose of your visit?
we're here for a biotechnology summit.
I'm giving a presentation.
Mr. And Mrs. Harris, welcome to Berlin.
Danke schon.
next, please.
I'm giving a presentation?
well, she asked.
oof. Welcome to Berlin. Taxi.
taxi.
Martin, get in the car. Let him do that.
Oh, ya-ya.
what do you think he's saying?
no idea.
look. Isabel Kronenberger is showing here on Saturday.
Oh, yeah.
remember when we saw her in Chicago?
Yes.
why don't I meet you there on Saturday after my lunch with Professor Bressler?
Yeah.
if you promise.
I promise.
welcome to the Hotel Adlon Kempinski. Thank you.
you check in, honey. I'll take care of this.
have you stayed with us before?
first time in Berlin. First time in Berlin.
if there's anything else I can do for you...
how much do I owe you?
thirty-seven, sir.
welcome to the Adlon Kempinski Berlin.
how may I help you, madam?
Dr. And Mrs. Harris, the Eisenhower suite.
of course.
wait, wait. Everything okay, sir?
is this everything from the taxi? Yes, sir.
I'm afraid, Mrs. Harris, but the Eisenhower suite may not be available right now.
what do you mean "not available"?
there have been changes, security reasons.
but we confirmed two weeks ago.
would you allow me to answer the phone?
I'll go to the airport. I'll be back, okay?
Oh, please.
excuse me, driver? Is there another route?
Oh, come on.
look out! No!
Hello? Hello?
can you hear me?
Dr. Farge?
Dr. Farge. Dr. Farge.
I don't speak German.
are you English?
American.
you have been in an accident.
accident?
can you tell me your name?
your name.
Martin. Martin Harris.
Dr. Martin Harris.
Where's my wife, Liz?
is she hurt? Is she hurt? Where is she? Calm down.
it's all right, Dr. Harris. You were the only passenger.
the taxi you were in went into the river.
your heart stopped for several minutes.
it's Thursday, November 24th. You have been in a coma for four days.
Thanksgiving. But my wife, she's in Berlin with me.
where is she? Why isn't she here?
we couldn't find any identification with you, Dr. Harris.
no, no, no.
please, calm down.
where can we reach your wife? Does she have a cell phone?
of course she has a cell phone. It's...
I can't remember.
can you tell me what you do remember, Martin?
bits and pieces. Arriving at the airport.
getting in a taxi with Liz, but I don't know how I got here.
there are no rules with severe trauma of this kind.
memories get lost or fractured.
most of them return, although it's unlikely you will ever fully recall the events around your accident.
in the meantime, let us see if anyone has filed a report looking for a Martin Harris, okay?
Yes, yes, yes. Okay.
from London with Kevin Spencer and Diana Bailey.
good evening. Welcome to the BNI World News.

I'm here for the summit.
nurse.
you have to realize the risk.

no, I don't, but...
you would know him, he's over there. Professor Bressler!
professor Bressler! Sir, please.
he knows me. He can confirm who I am.
if you will be patient, sir, no problem.
I'm being very patient.
thank God. There she is.
that's my wife, over there by the buffet table.
I have been missing for four days and she has no idea what happened to me.
so I need you to take me to her right now.
okay. Thank you.
the lady in the dark dress. Okay.
excuse me, madam.
your husband is here.
Liz. Oh, Jesus.
excuse me. Do I know you?
but, Liz... What's wrong?
I'm sorry.
I was in an accident. I was in a coma. They didn't know who I was.
I said I'm sorry.
Oh, you must have me confused with someone else.
Liz.
it's me, Martin.
your husband.
this is a misunderstanding. I don't know this man.
okay. Martin.
this is my husband.
you are Dr. Martin Harris?
last time I looked.
Yep, still me.
what's going on here? Is this some kind of a joke?
joke about what?
because it's not very funny.
do you know this man? No.
who the hell are you?
who the hell are you?
I'm her husband.
okay. Okay.
would you mind just getting him away from us, please?
Liz. Liz, stop this. Hey.
gentlemen, please, please, please. Get your hands off me.
back off. What's going on?
tell me. Back off!
what's this all about? Why don't you take a walk?
gentlemen, please.
don't touch me. Come on, come on!
if you don't leave now, we have to call the police.
call the police! Call the goddamn army! That's a good idea!
what's happening? You're embarrassing me. Please.
get him out of here. Liz!
I must apologize. Have a nice evening. I was hurt!
Liz! Why are you doing this to me? You okay?
can you believe this?
right there.
that's Liz. And I am...
I must've been outside. I can't remember.
well, as you can see, you are not there.
immigration confirms the arrival of a Dr. And Mrs. Harris, on November the 20th at 7: 40 a. m. Yes.
at 8: 50, she checked into their suite at the hotel followed by Dr. Harris at 3 in the afternoon.
what? Danke.
wait. He's... He's not Martin Harris.
I am Dr. Martin Harris.
the man upstairs is pretending to be me.
and this impostor, did he also steal your wife?
he must be forcing her or something.
well, why? Help me. Why?
for God's sake, just do an Internet search.
there are over 400 Martin Harrises in the United States, sir.
we already checked.
rod. Rodney Cole, a colleague at Langemore in the States.
a dear friend. He can verify who I am.
please, call him. It's 001...
this is Dr. Cole. I'm having an...
sorry, answering machine.
please, leave a message.
professor Bressler. Talk to him. He's the reason I'm in Berlin.
he invited me over to the summit to discuss my thesis.
you know Professor Bressler? Yes.
well, we haven't actually met, but we've been speaking on the phone emailing, dozens of times.
why don't you arrest him? For what?
entering the country legally?
presenting all the correct documentation and sharing a hotel suite with his wife?
excuse me. With your wife.
she is my wife.
Herr Strauss?
I found a Dr. Martin Harris at Langemore University.
Yes. Thank you. That's what I've been trying...
okay.
wait, please, wait.
you're going to arrest me? I demand to speak to my embassy.
unfortunately, it's your Thanksgiving.
the embassy's closed until Monday.
Herr Strauss, can I have a quiet word, please?
okay.
listen, you're probably right. I...
the accident.
I, uh...
I haven't been remembering things very well. I'm confused.
this is my doctor at the hospital here in Berlin.
he warned me that this sort of thing, this was gonna happen.
I need to go back there now.
I'm so embarrassed.
so now you are saying that you are not Dr. Martin Harris?
I don't know.
wait, stop. Stop. I've changed my mind.
need passport. Please.
please?
police. Very bad.
this is Dr. Cole.
I'm having an out-of-office experience right now.
please, leave a message.
Rodney, it's me, Martin.
listen, I'm in Berlin for the summit, but...
it's Liz. She's...
I...I don't know what she's doing, and there's another man involved.
it... she... she...
I'm in trouble, Rod. We...
shit.
hold the door.
he says he doesn't care if she saved your life.
the bitch cost him 20, 000 Euros.
the insurance won't cover the cab as she had no license.
he says illegal immigrants are destroying German society.
so I'm guessing he doesn't know where she is.
no one knows where she is.
well, thank him for his time.
excuse me.
Hey, American. I'm sorry we couldn't help you.
you know where she is, I can tell.
look, I just wanna thank her. She saved my life.
I thought maybe I could give her some money. I just wanna thank her.
please.
you remember me?
I was in your taxi. I don't drive taxi.
I was in your taxi.
we crashed.
I need to know, where did you pick me up?
where was I going? How did you find me?
your friend, Biko.
Gina, stop stalking and get back to work.
just leave me alone.
please, help me.
just leave me alone.
thank you for saving me.
excuse me.
I need to find Professor Bressler's lab.
I have an appointment at 12: 30. I'm late.
your name, please? Dr. Martin Harris.
wait here, please.
the professor knows who I am.
we scheduled this appointment weeks ago.
Drake, the English botanist, who wondered how it manages to reproduce as it doesn't appear to attract any insects.
Yes. One wonders how plants are developing firm, unlike m...
what are you doing here?
Bressler. This lab is restricted. Who are you?
this man is not Martin Harris. I am Dr. Martin Harris.
so, what is this? There are two Martin Harrises, huh?
no, let me explain.
this man showed up at my hotel last night claiming to be me.
the police were called. I called the police, son of a bitch!
he checked himself out of a hospital.
he was in an accident. Professor.
professor, should I call the police?
ja. Danke.
we talked, you and I, on the phone.
we discussed alternative forms of propagation.
I told you about my father, a schoolteacher, his passion for science.
we talked about your children, about how much time you've spent with them since you lost your wife.
two girls, right?
you told me their names. And I...
I just can't...
I know them. I know them.
Laurel. Laurel, Lily, twins.
ten years old.
about the same age I was when I told my father I wanted to be a botanist.
do you remember, Professor? We talked about that on the phone how I'd never seen my father this happy.
no, that wasn't you.
don't you remember? We spoke about how brave our wives were...
to marry scientists.
I told you about our... Our honeymoon in Paris.
my wife and I. And how she wanted to visit all the museums.
all I wanted to do was go to the... L'Ecole Polytechnique.
but she insisted.
and that's how I first saw Leonardo's Vitruvian man.
this is not happening.
professor, the police are here.
moment, Moment.
I don't know who this man is, but he has taken everything from me.
you have to arrest him.
go on, arrest him.
I don't believe I need to do this.
no.
maybe I shouldn't do this, but...
my friend, he...looks...
no, he finds people.
Martin.
the mistake was mine. I should never have let you leave.
what's happening to me, doctor? Confusion, memory loss, complete or partial loss of identity.
these are common stages in recovery.
we are going to sedate you now, do another MRI, try to find out what's going on, okay?
if I'm not Martin Harris, why do I know so much about him?
perhaps he was someone you read about or met once in passing.
do you know what it feels like to become insane, doctor?
it's like a war between being told who you are and knowing who you are.
which do you think wins?
Hello, Martin. This won't take very long.
excuse me, where are you taking this patient?
I have instructions to move this patient to the American Hospital in Wiesbaden.
you can't take hime until I get confirmation.
here's the paperwork.
show me that. I need to make a phone call.
it's okay. I'm feeling much, much better.
and now with us, Rebecca for the weather.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
so it's going to be a cold night here in Central Berlin with an overnight low of three degrees and a high probability of more snow throughout tomorrow.
and now to the West, to the Ruhr Valley.
Herr Jurgen? Yeah?
you met her?
she looked after me in the hospital.
she was kind to me too.
I'm sorry. She's dead.
come. Come in.
thank you.
drink?
no, thanks.
I was a former member of the Stasi, the Ministry for State Security.
east German secret police, huh? Yes.
proudly.
excuse me.
I cannot drink any longer, but I like to forget that.
we Germans are experts at forgetting. We forgot we were Nazis.
now we have forgotten 40 years of Communism, all gone.
but it's not just history that's forgotten, it's people too.
please tell me more about Nurse Gretchen Herfort.
quite a story.
for a moment, they had me convinced I was crazy.
but when they came to take me, when they...killed your friend, I knew.
I'm not sure how I can be of service.
I need you to help me prove I'm me.
may I?
please.
it's a gift from my father.
I always have it with me.
these mean anything to you?
no. It's my wife's writing.
so they mean something to her.
that's my schedule for this week. I wrote it from memory.
your wife's involvement in this.
there must have been something in the past, a new friend, an acquaintance?
no, no, no.
unexplained absence?
no, no. There was nothing. I would've known.
men always like to think.
it's not Liz. I know her.
yet she does not know you.
look, whoever's been doing this, they've been planning it for some time.
they have passports, credit cards, family photos, for God's sakes.
I mean, this takes preparation, doesn't it?
they have detailed knowledge of my research, my relationship with Professor...
as well as the fact that you were going to have a random accident that would allow a stranger to seamlessly take your place?
these people may be good, but they are not God.
a little confirmation would be nice.
somewhere there's proof. They can't have thought of everything.
the question is, why would they want to take your place?
what could they gain from being you?
what does your wife gain by denying you exist?
do you believe me?
in the Stasi, we had a basic principle:
ask enough questions and a man who is lying will eventually change his story, but a man who tells the truth cannot change his however unlikely his story sounds.
do you believe me? I believe...
you are telling the truth, Dr. Harris.
I'll start by calling your colleague at Langemore.
as you say, it's Thanksgiving, and there's the time difference, so it may take time to make contact.
then there is the question of...
Oh, of money. Of course.
unfortunately, yes. Money.
of course. Here. Here's everything I have.
I'll pay you in full as soon as I can.
for expenses. Sure.
I'll need 24 hours. Call me tomorrow afternoon.
and go find your taxi driver. See if she'll talk to me.
she was there at the beginning of all this.
perhaps she knows something.
I've already tried.
there may be details we've overlooked.
that's what I was really known for, details.
Gina?
I know why you ran away from the accident.
you're an illegal.
if the police had picked you up, they would have deported you.
look, I want you to have this.
what if I don't want it? It's worth at least 5000 Euro.
feel the weight of it. Go on. It's the real thing.
"e. H. To M. H."?
Elizabeth Harris, my wife, to me, Martin.
special gift.
okay, Martin Harris. What do you want?
there's someone I need you to speak to.
I'm not talking to the police.
he's not the police. I promise you.
I just need you to tell him what happened.
anything, everything you can remember.
and I need a place to crash tonight.
please?
sentiment, it's always the first thing to go.
airport security.
Mr. Brandt, line one is for you.
Brandt.
it's Jurgen...
Jurgen?
...from the good old days.
Hans, you have to do me a favor.
I picked you up from the Adlon Hotel. You wanted to go to the airport.
you were in a hurry.
that's it?
but I'd just arrived. Doesn't make sense.
she didn't recognize you? How long have you been married?
five years. Five years?
I know it sounds crazy, but it's true.
this is it.
sorry, no elevator.
I know, not the Adlon Hotel.
the walls are made of cardboard, but it's home.
I have to work tonight. You can sleep in there.
I have extra mattress.
it's quaint.
prince Shada in assassination attempt
would you mind if I took a shower?
you could try. I'm not sure you will fit.
the light is broken.
you need to leave the door open if you want to see anything.
I'm sorry. I just... I'm sorry. I give you a place to stay.
that does not give you the right to... You're right.
they're good, the drawings.
you want to know?
this is me.
two thousand two hundred fifty-eight Euros...and counting.
I get to 4000, I can buy papers so I can get the hell out of here.
sell the watch. You'll get more than you need.
I plan to.
how do you sleep?
eh. He never goes for very long.
this guy, Jurgen.
he's absolutely no danger to you.
okay.
hello.
you got company.
do you have the keys?
bring it back to my place, leave the keys on the TV and don't forget to reset the meter.
you're the best. I know. Come.
Yes, I sleep with every American you send my way.
no need to explain.
Biko! You're going to be late.
Shh.
Jones?
Biko? Biko?
who are you?
who the hell are you?
Biko's keys.
give them to me. Come on, you can't stay here.
this one!
are you all right?
that guy, he killed a nurse in the hospital.
what? He killed a nurse.
shit!
left, go left! Hang on!
where is he? I can't see him.
where is...? Where's the wiper switch? It's on the left!
shit!
come on! Go!
get off the tracks! I'm trying to!
Jesus!
come on, come on! Go!
come on! Run!
in here.
out of the way. Out of the way.
slow down, take it easy.
we are being followed. Vladimir.
hi Gina.
we're all full. calm down How does it feel to treat me like you do?
when you've laid your hands upon me and you've told me who you are I thought I was mistaken how do I feel?
tell me now how do I feel?
Gina.
you have to know I have never laid eyes on those men.
why the hell did you have to get into my taxi?
I wish I hadn't. Believe me.
and Biko. His family is in Africa.
the money will just stop coming. They will never know why.
men like that, back there.
I have seen those kind of men before.
they killed my family in Bosnia.
my mother, my father, my brothers, slaughtered!
we have to disappear.
Gina, they're after me, not you.
don't be stupid. They're after both of us!
if they killed Biko, they'll kill me just as easily.
are you ready?
don't ask.
thank you.
I'm sorry I brought more trouble into your life.
I will try and make up for it. I promise.
I know.
I've figured something out.
it's a simple code.
the first number refers to a page in the book.
the second to a line on that page, the third to words on that line.
what are the words?
the Latin names of two plant species:
calochortus albus and Umbellularia Californica.
fairy Lantern and California Bay, both common, flowering plants.
what does it mean?
that I don't know.
not part of your work, or Professor Bressler's?
no.
tell me, Martin, how close are Professor Bressler and Prince Shada?
very close. The prince is sponsoring the summit.
they're both progressives.
Bressler wants to end world hunger.
he's researching new forms of crop cultivation offering open access to his data.
the prince funds his work.
he knows the world will need food long after his oil resources are depleted.
those agricultural patents will be worth a fortune.
but the prince's progressiveness has cost him.
extremists in his own country hate him and yet he perseveres his course, despite multiple attempts on his life.
there's a cocktail party before Bressler's speech tonight, is that correct?
Yes.
for some, that might be a very good reason to want to be you.
martin Harris with just a few guests in a confined space with Prince Shada.
jurgen may be right, but he might not be able to prove it.
I need to find Liz.
Oh, Martin, that is not a good idea.
the people who have her have been sticking to my schedule.
I know where she'll be today.
someone will be watching her. What if he's there?
he won't be. He's me, remember?
he'll be meeting with Bressler.
yeah? They just sat down.
let me know when they leave. Thanks.
okay.
please leave a message after the tone.
he is on his way.
Liz.
what are you doing here?
Liz. What's happening?
are you crazy? You have to leave me alone.
Why? You have to tell me why. Are they making you do this?
are they threatening you?
how did you find me? Did you follow me?
when we arrived, you saw the ad.
you mentioned when we first saw her show, in Chicago, together.
don't you remember?
I can't get out. Come with me right now.
no. They'll kill us both.
I never should have left you.
I never should have gotten into that taxi.
you don't understand, do you?
your briefcase. It got left behind at the airport.
that's why you were going back.
you need to find it.
wait for me there.
Liz, Liz, wait.
I love you.
what did she say? Not here.
where have you been? Hm?
I have to go to the airport right away.
ja?
is this Ernst Jurgen? Yes, it is.
my name is Rodney Cole. I received a phone message from you.
and I received two from Martin as well. What's the problem?
Oh, dear. Oh, that's unbelievable. The poor man.
well, listen, here's the good news. I've just arrived in Berlin.
Yes, I've been teaching in Leipzig, at the Hochschule Fur Technik.
I'm sorry, please excuse my German.
well, I came up for the last day to hear Bressler's speech.
I could come right over.
no, no, no, it's fine.
it's no problem at all. It's not far. I know exactly where you are.
I look forward to meeting you, Mr. Cole.
well, then, I'll see you soon. Bye.
Rodney Cole?
Leipzig?
Herr Jurgen?
Dr. Cole.
how do you do?
thank you.
drink?
I have a bottle labeled brandy, which is more than likely hair lacquer or some vodka my neighbor gave me after it made her husband go blind.
no, thank you.
maybe some coffee? I'm making some for myself.
no, I'm fine. Thank you.
you were in the military.
in the Stasi in East Germany.
well, my grandson's gonna be very excited to hear that.
he loves all this Cold War stuff.
Oh, look at that.
what kind of car is that?
that's a Volga GAZ-24.
suspension of a donkey cart and smelled like a tannery.
vanished as quickly as the Wall.
Oh. This business with Martin is a hell of a thing.
how did he find you?
quite by chance, as it happens.
I would say he was damn lucky. How can I help?
come with us to the authorities. Help them confirm his identity.
the authorities? Oh, Jesus. Is it that bad?
I mean, a man comes to you with a story.
why did you take his case?
eh. Curiosity.
is that all?
there's not much in this world left to interest an old spy like me.
a few questions I still think over.
one in particular from when I worked for the Aufklarung our Foreign Intelligence wing.
they used to talk about a European-based assassination unit called Section 15.
freelance, deniable.
they'd work for whoever would pay.
public sector, private sector.
Second-to-none in their planning and efficiency.
what's more, they never failed.
and I am told they are still in existence, but that's only rumor, of course.
you had time after I called you.
why didn't you run?
where should I run from Section 15, Mr. Cole?
I can hardly walk.
before we could get Chesterfields,
I smoked 60 machorkas a day.
filthy Soviet things. Killed more Russians than Stalin.
my doctors assure me I'll soon be joining their list of casualties.
I want to know how he found you.
I want every name, every source you contacted on his behalf.
and then what?
we shake hands and you go away?
cyanide.
you never think you'll have the courage to use it.
but you do.
the best of us do.
what if he remembers everything?
what then?
may I see some identification?
he doesn't have any. He was in an accident.
that's why the bag was unclaimed.
wait, wait. Please.
the combination for the lock is...
who am I?
may I?
you shouldn't stay here. It's not safe for you.
Liz told me to wait here.
where are you going?
you've got your life back. I'm happy for you.
now I need to get on with mine.
Gina.
thank you.
it's more than I need.
it's less than you deserve. For everything you've been through.
go on, take it.
what if she told them where you were going?
Liz? She wouldn't.
how do you know?
Gina, she's my wife.
Yes, she is.
it's too heavy for me.
Martin.
Martin.
Oh, my God, look at you. How are you doing?
Rodney? What are you doing here?
well, you called me. Don't you remember?
you left a message on my machine. I got on the first plane I could.
what have you gotten yourself into?
I'm sorry to drag you into this, but...
don't be. We've been friends for 15 years.
I know you'd do the same for me.
let me take that for you, huh?
I don't have all day.
help me with my bags, please.
I've never had this happen before.
you really think you are Martin Harris, don't you?
what the hell, Rod?
you're my oldest friend.
you know who I am. It's me. It's not this other guy. He's not...
martin Harris? No, course he's not.
but, then, neither are you.
what? There is no Martin Harris.
he doesn't exist.
you invented him.
he's your legend.
you just made him up as a cover to get into the conference.
you're not making sense. Liz... Liz.
Liz is not your wife.
you were a professional team.
no. No, no. This is insane. She...
your memories are not real.
martin Harris is a fabrication.
you just invented a life, and then you filled in the gaps.
she's right. You're really gone on this.
she had to go in with a backup. How do you think she feels?
they're gonna write a textbook on you someday.
and thank you for retrieving the briefcase from the airport.
leaving it there was untidy.
it was a loose end that didn't fit in with our plans, and Jurgen figured us out.
by the way, he's dead.
and he died very well.
and I'm afraid that isn't something I'm gonna be able to say about you.
I'm sorry.
I'm really, really sorry.
Rodney!
why are you doing this?
one year of preparation.
we did everything we could to make you come back.
do you know how much time you've wasted? It's Thanksgiving.
I could've been home with my family, having dinner instead of cleaning up your mess because you bumped your head and started to believe your cover.
tell me...
who am I?
you were a trained assassin, and you were my best boy.
and now you're just gonna be another nameless dead junkie.
Gina, stay down!
Gina. Gina.
no. No.
martin Harris married to Elizabeth Terman, July 18, 2006, Martha's Vineyard.
father died, September 9, 1987, of a heart attack.
I made it up. I made it up to kill a man I've never met.
look, August 27th, the entry stamp.
you were in Berlin three months ago.
are you ready? Almost.
ready.
who are these people? They can become anyone.
they...
we are killers.
prince Shada is gonna be assassinated tonight.
there's a bomb in his suite. I put it there.
you should've let me drown.
what matters is what you do now, Martin.
prince Shada, are you going to stay in Berlin?
will you be funding research at the university?
are you interested in GM crops, Prince Shada?
how long have you been working with Professor Bressler?
the conference guests are taking their seats for dinner.
professor Bressler has entered the hotel lobby.
the Professor is making his way to the Eisenhower Suite for the reception.
switch to the 5th floor.
prince Shada has left his suite.
he's on his way to the reception as well.
we're so honored you could attend.
the honor is all mine.
would you like a drink? In some circles my husband is more well-known for his martinis than his research.
do you have an invitation, sir?
I don't know if I'm supposed to have an invitation. Leo, please, come in.
I don't think you need an invitation to your reception.
good to see you.
so good to see you. Have you met our host?
not yet. Hello.
now I can see why somebody would pretend to be him.
this way.
I need security at the service entrance.
Oh, let me take that.
I'd rather hold on to this, if you don't mind.
Oh, you can trust me, Professor.
separation anxiety.
just leave it there, if you could. Of course.
thank you.
Danke.
come, say hello to my friends.
Danke schon.
Oh, excuse me.
it's you.
I am not so sure about that.
many of my relatives would not agree.
this way.
get your hands off her!
okay, I'm coming.
there's a bomb in the Eisenhower suite.
I put it there three months ago!
now you are saying you are Dr. Martin Harris?
you're not listening!
take me to the room. I'll show you exactly where it is.
up to the room, in the middle of a party with Prince Shada and the world's leading scientific minds?
of course, why didn't you say so before?
I'm not lying!
pull up the reception recordings from August 27th of this year.
do it now, or many people will die!
excuse me, I'm going to grab my bag. Sure.
here. Why don't you just wear it? Like some nerdy accessory?
Oh.
thank you.
that's got all your secrets in it, right? Yeah.
if you'd like to say so...
would you excuse me? I have to go check on something.
stop. Stop. That's it.
do you see? Look! Do you see?
sound the alarm.
evacuate the entire hotel.
we'll meet the Prince at the service entrance.
you two stay here and make sure they don't leave the room.
is that clear.
attention, attention.
could all guests leave the hotel by the front entrance?
shit. Attention, attention.
could all guests leave the hotel by the front entrance?
find the target. Finish it.
we got what we came for. I'm going to take care of the bomb.
forget about it.
they have my image on file from when we planted it.
so what?
I don't want my face connected to an explosion we no longer need.
go!
Lily, Laurel.
Bressler's girls. Lily, Laurel. Flowering plants.
calochortus albus and Umbellularia Californica.
the code, from the book.
they're his passwords.
Bressler's supposedly working on a new strain of corn.
one that can grow in any climate. It's revolutionary.
if they access his research and kill him, it could be worth billions in the wrong hands.
Laurel! Laurel!
Papa! Laurel!
that bomb goes off, it'll look as if Shada was killed by extremists.
the prince was never the target. It's Bressler.
listen, listen! You have to tell Strauss, they're after Bressler!
do you understand?
go! Go!
out of the way! Move! Move!
Laurel! Laurel! Papa!
Laurel! Laurel!
Oh, Laurel.
Papa!
she was wandering around, looking for you.
thank you very much. You're welcome.
we have to leave. Yes, yes.
Christ, you really don't remember anything, do you?
this'll be at the party where we'll access Bressler's computer and steal his files.
the client wants this clean.
he wants the material from Bressler's computer and Bressler dead.
no one can ever know what happened.
when the bomb goes off, it'll appear that Shada was the target and that Bressler was collateral damage.
looks great.
time for the A team?
I didn't forget everything.
I remember how to kill you, asshole.
less than 24 hours after the failed assassination attempt on the Saudi prince,
nobel laureate Professor Leo Bressler announced the development of a new strain of corn, fast-growing, self-propagating, drought-tolerant, and pest-resistant to be made available worldwide without patent or copyright costs.
we have made the genetic map of this new sustenance available to all.
it's a gift.
it's a gift from Prince Shada and from science to mankind.
humanitarian organizations applauded the announcement, but agri-business companies were taken by surprise and watched as stocks plunged 14 percent.
this is Annabelle Mandeng reporting from Berlin.
and in other news, the European Parliament today passed legislation to remove trade tariffs on imported African rice with 582 members of the 736-seat body voting to ratify the measure.
Hey. Now you're free to do whatever you want.
Claudia Marie Taylor.
I like it. It suits you.
who are you?
Henry. Henry Taylor.
Ahh. Nice to meet you, Mr. Taylor.
nice to meet you.
this is what I get in return for 30 years of service for my company?
and they send some yo-yo like you in here, to try to tell me that I'm out of a job?
they should be telling you you're out of a job.
you have a lot of gall, coming in here and firing your No. 1 producer.
you're going to go home and make more money than you've ever made in your life and I'm going to go home without a pay cheque. Fuck you.
I guess you leave me dumbfounded. I don't know where this is coming from.
how am I meant to go back as a man and explain to my wife I lost my job?
on a stress level, I've heard that losing your job is like a death in the family.
but personally, I feel more like the people I worked with were my family and I died.
I can't afford to be unemployed.
I have a house payment, I have children.
I don't know how you can live with yourself, but I'm sure that you'll find a way while the rest of us are suffering.
who the fuck are you, man?
excellent question. Who the fuck am I?
poor Steve has worked here for seven years.
he's never had a meeting with me before or passed me in the hall, or told me a story in the break room.
that's because I don't work here.
I work for another company that lends me out to pussies like Steve's boss who don't have the balls to sack their own employees, in some cases for good reason. People do crazy shit when they get fired.
did I do something wrong?
I mean, is there something I could do differently here?
this is not an assessment of your productivity. Don't take this personally.
don't take it personally.
Steven, I want you to review this packet.
take it seriously. I think you're gonna find a lot of good answers in here.
I'm sure this is gonna be very helpful - a packet.
thank you... A packet.
well, anybody who ever built an empire or changed the world sat where you are right now.
and it's because they sat there they were able to do it.
that's the truth.
I'm gonna need your keycard.
great. OK.
now, I want you to take the day, go get together your personal things, then tomorrow you get yourself some exercise. You go out for a jog, you give yourself some routines and pretty soon you find your legs.
how do I get in touch with you? - Don't worry, we'll be in touch soon.
this is just the beginning.
I'll never see Steve again.
to know me is to fly with me. This is where I live.
when I run my card, the system automatically prompts the desk clerk to greet me with this exact statement:
pleasure to see you again, Mr Bingham.
it's these kinds of systemised friendly touches that keep my world in orbit.
all the things you probably hate about travelling
the recycled air, the artificial lighting, the digital juice dispensers, the cheap sushi - are warm reminders that I'm home.
do you want the cancer?
the what? - Do you want the cancer?
the cancer?
the can...sir? - Oh, no. I'm fine, thank you.
how much does your life weigh?
imagine for a second that you're carrying a backpack.
I want you to feel the straps on your shoulders. Feel them?
now I want you to pack it with all the stuff that you have in your life.
start with the little things, the things on shelves and in drawers the knick-knacks, the collectibles.
feel the weight as that adds up.
then you start adding larger stuff - clothes, table-top appliances, lamps, linens, your TV...
the backpack should be getting pretty heavy now. And you go bigger.
your couch, bed, your kitchen table. Stuff it all in there.
your car, get it in there.
your home, whether it's a studio apartment or a two-bedroomed house.
I want you to stuff it all into that backpack.
now try to walk.
it's kind of hard, isn't it?
this is what we do to ourselves on a daily basis
we weigh ourselves down until we can't even move. And make no mistake...
moving is living.
now, I'm gonna set that backpack on fire. What do you want to take out of it?
photos?
photos are for people who can't remember. Drink some ginkgo and let the photos burn.
in fact, let everything burn and imagine waking up tomorrow with nothing.
it's kind of exhilarating, isn't it?
welcome back, Mr Bingham.
Ryan Bingham's office. - You have me in a Dodge Stratus in Kansas City.
they were out of all full-size sedans. - Did you try...
Yes, I reminded them of your remarkable No. 1 Gold Club status in years in the program.
they are literally moving mountains to see you in a Sebring.
fair enough. Any other messages? - Er...your sister Kara called.
needs to speak urgently about your sister's wedding.
I told her you were mid-air, and not even I knew your destination.
well done. - You got an invitation to speak at GoalQuest in Vegas.
every once in a while, I do speaking engagements, motivational stuff. But GoalQuest?
we're talking major Tony Robbins shit.
it's got a hologram on it. They're calling it Dos Equis.
all right, I'll check in. - I've got Craig Gregory for you.
Wait...ah. Fuck.
how is my little road warrior?
Hey, 20 minutes from boarding into a world of bliss.
real good numbers out of Phoenix, Ry guy.
you know that Big Auto is about to cut another 10K by the end of the month?
no kidding. - Christmas came early.
I wish you could be in five places, but I need you here in Omaha this week. Alright?
I thought you needed me everywhere. - We got something real big, a real game changer.
what are we talking about here?
you'll see. Today I took my first crap in two weeks - Hallelujah.
that's me hanging up on you. - Great, love that sound.
are you satisfied with Maestro?
Yeah, I am.
a little stingy with their miles. I like Hertz.
no, Hertz keeps its vehicles too long. If a car has over 20, 000 miles, I won't drive it.
maestro doesn't instant checkout. I like the park-and-go.
hertz doesn't guarantee navigation. - You don't seem like a girl who needs directions.
I hate asking for directions. - That's why I get a nav.
that new outfit, Colonial, isn't bad.
is that a joke? - Yes.
their kiosk placement blows. - They never have available upgrades.
basically, it's a fleet of shit boxes. I don't know how they're still in business.
I'm Ryan. - I'm Alex.
Aww...Maplewood card. How dare you bring that into this palace?
hilton offers equal value and better food but the Maplewood gives out warm cookies at check-in.
I'm a sucker for simulated hospitality.
there's an industry term for that. It's a mixture of faux and homey - faumey.
Oh, my God. I wasn't sure this actually existed.
this is the American Airlines... - It's a Concierge Key, yeah.
what is that, carbon fibre? - Graphite.
Oh, I love the weight. - I was pretty excited the day that bad boy came in.
I'll say. I put up pretty pedestrian numbers. 60 thou a year, domestic.
that's not bad. - Don't patronise me.
what's your total? - It's a personal question.
Pleace. - And we hardly know each other.
show some hubris. Come on, impress me.
I bet it's huge. - You have no idea.
how big?
what is it, this big? This big? - I don't want to brag.
Oh, come on! Come on.
let's just say I have a number in mind. I haven't hit it yet.
this is pretty fucking sexy. - Hope it doesn't cheapen our relationship.
we're two people who get turned on by Elite Status. I think cheap is our starting point.
there's nothing cheap about loyalty.
we came up with this master plan, which was for me to put gauze, to put bandages on both my hands.
then we got on the plane, transatlantic, flying to erm...Zurich.
I waited till it was dark, and I walked up to the bathroom with her.
everybody was watching the movie and I was like...
opened up, went inside. She opened the door for me, and came in like she was gonna help me.
we gave it our best shot. It wasn't great. But it was fun. It was tricky.
give me some details. - It's not so easy. Have you tried it?
it's not so easy. - Yes, I have.
Really? - Really.
you've done that? - I have done that.
on a transatlantic flight? - On a domestic flight - regional, actually.
at night-time? - Daytime.
what? - How do you do that?
Oh, I'm really flexible.
look. Ohh.
Ah, I should throw these out.
we can always use that room with the ice machine.
look.
good call on that towel rack.
I like how you burritoed me in the sofa cushions.
I was improvising.
shame we didn't make it to the closet.
we got to do this again. - Oh, yeah.
I'm in Newark on the 12th, Modesto on the 13th...
Oklahoma City on the 15th...
any Southwest? I'll be swinging by Albuquerque week of the 16th.
no, I'm in Florida on the 20th. - Fort Lauderdale?
Miami. - That's nothing. - 40 minutes.
I should probably go back to my room so I can wake up in my bed.
I think that would be the ladylike thing to do.
nice meeting you. - A pleasure.
Hello?
Hey, Ryan, how you holding up?
every family has one person who keeps the genealogy in check.
that's my sister Kara - the glue.
fine. You and the kids?
Missy's outstanding, Matthew made varsity. How's the road?
couldn't be better.
good. So, Ryan?
yeah?
I didn't even want to ask you this, because I know how you are about doing things for others.
but we're coming up on three weeks to go to Julie's wedding and we could really use your help.
yeah?
we've been sending people these kits, so they can print out photos of Julie and Jim on cardbord, and then take photos of them in interesting places, like that gnome in the French movie.
Why?
because it's Julie's wedding and she thinks it would be fun. Does it matter why?
how is Julie?
would you call her. She thinks you've turned to butter.
you're awfully isolated how you live. - Isolated? I'm surrounded.
so your assistant said you were gonna be in Vegas.
did he?
can you get a photo of the cut-out in front of the Luxor pyramid?
the place is a shithole. Nobody stays there.
Jesus, Ryan, I'm not asking you to check in. Can you just take a stupid photo?
I'll try my best.
thank you for trying your best.
last year, I spent 322 days on the road, which means I had to spend 43 miserable days at home.
Hey, neighbour.
I signed for this while you were gone. - Oh, thanks.
I hope it wasn't too much of a bother. - Nah.
it's my sister. I haven't met the guy yet. They're getting married.
lots of luck. - I know, right?
what are you doing tonight? You wanna come over later?
um...I've started seeing somebody.
Oh. OK. Great.
Hey, it's good to see you.
you too. - It seems like it's been a while this time.
I'm thrilled that everyone's back under one roof. Welcome home, boy's.
there's been a lot of whispering about why we're here, so let me jump right in.
retailers are down 20%.
auto industry is in the dump. Housing market doesn't have a heartbeat.
it is one of the worst times on record for America.
this is our moment.
now, last summer, we received a dynamite young woman here from Cornell.
and she had some pretty big ideas that she challenged me with.
my first reaction was, "Who does this kid think she is?
but after I gave it a listen, she really knocked me out. So...
with a peek into our future, Natalie Keener.
if there's one word I want to leave you with today, it's this.
Glocal?
Glocal.
our global must become local.
this company keeps 23 people on the road at least 250 days a year.
it's expensive and it's inefficient
when I came to Craig three months ago with this, he told me, and quite astutely, it's only a problem if you have a solution.
well, today I stand before you with just that.
you all know Ned in reception. Today I'm gonna fire Ned.
sorry, Ned. I'm sure HR will hire you back this afternoon.
we'll see about that.
Ned could be any employee in any one of our clients' locations worldwide.
strategy packets will be shipped in advance.
Ned will be given a seat and find one of our transition specialists waiting.
mr Laskin, we're having this conversation as your position is no longer available.
I don't understand. I'm fired?
hearing the words "You've been let go" is never easy.
change is scary, but consider the following:
anybody who ever built an empire or changed the world sat where you are now.
and it's because they sat there that they were able to do it.
that's my fucking line.
but what happens now?
this is the first step of a process that ends with you in a job that fulfils you.
Yeah, but how does it work?
take the packet in front of you.
review it - all the answers you're looking for are inside.
fill out the necessary information and you're on the way to new opportunities.
Ned, go back to your desk and start putting together your things.
as a favour to me, I'd appreciate it if you didn't spread the news just yet.
panic doesn't help anyone.
I understand.
give it up for Ned.
you can start the morning in Boston, stop in Dallas over lunch, and finish the day in San Francisco. All for the price of a T1 line.
our inflated travel budget is eviscerated by 85%.
and more importantly, to you guys on the road, no more Christmases in a hotel in Tulsa, no more hours lost to weather delays.
you get to come home.
tell me you're not taking this seriously.
that's why I brought the entire company in from the road, because we're not taking it seriously.
there is a methodology to what I do, a reason it works.
coke and IBM have been doing this for years. Familiar with them?
like anything else, it'll take a few months of transition and everybody will settle in.
who are you taking off the road? - How are you not getting this?
you are grouned. Everybody's grounded. It's done.
what we do here is brutal and it does leave people devastated.
but there is a dignity to the way I do it.
by stabbing them in the chest instead of the back, right?
you wanted to see me? - Well, uhm...
you know what? Yeah, come on in. - Great job out there.
thank you. How's everyone taking it? - Great.
listen, I admire your...zeal. And I think you have some very good ideas.
but you know nothing about the realities of my industry.
you can set up an iChat, but you don't know how people think.
I minored in psychology. - Nice.
OK, kiddo, fire me. - Ryan...
if she's gonna do this regularly, don't you wanna know if she can fire people?
she's fired Ned. - My dog can fire Ned. Fire me.
you don't need to do this. - No, it's OK. I got this.
mr Bingham,
I regret to inform you that your position at this company is no longer available.
hm. Who the hell are you?
my name is Miss Keener. I'm here today to discuss your future.
my future? The only one who can fire me is Craig Gregory.
he hired me to handle this for him. - Handle what? Handle Me?
Mr. Gregory hired me, he's the only one who can fire me.
know what? I'm gonna go talk to him. - Mr Bingham...
no, no. You can't follow me. You're on a computer screen, remember?
Ryan. - Let's try this again. Fire me again.
I just did. - Actually, you didn't. Fire me.
that's enough. We get it.
mr Bingham, I'm here to inform you your position is no longer available.
I'm fired? - Yes, you're fired.
never say fired. - You've been let go.
Why?
this is a mythical situation. How could I possibly know why?
why doesn't matter, you never know why.
don't focus on the why. Rather, spend your energy thinking about your future.
well, I'm gonna spend my energy on suing you unless you give me a good reason why you're firing me.
Mr. Bingham, the reason's not important.
you're firing me without grounds? I have a lawsuit.
I get what you're trying to say, Ryan. - Don't take this personally, Mr. Bingham.
personally?
this is the most personal situation you are ever gonna enter, so before you try to revolutionise my business,
I'd like to know that you actually know my business.
that's a hell of a way to welcome her to the team.
am I the only one that sees that by doing this we're making ourselves irrelevant?
no, frankly, we're making you irrelevant.
nice. - Don't blame me.
blame high fuel costs, blame insurance premiums, blame technology.
watch it. You're a little too young to become a dinosaur.
I'm not a dinosaur. - I want you to show her the ropes.
what do I know what goes on here? Get Ferguson to do it.
I'm not talking about here.
no. - Yeah.
you're very confident this girl doesn't know what she's doing. So...
I'm sorry. I don't think a MySpace page qualifies you to rewire a company.
here's your chance. Go out, show her the magic, take her through the paces.
I'm not a fucking tour guide.
now here we go. - Bingham, here's the boat.
and here's you. Do you want to be in the boat?
Yeah, alone.
we're ringing the bell, we're rounding everybody up.
you want to stay out a bit longer, you're welcome, but you will not be alone. Ok?
you let me know.
Oh, Christ.
what? - Follow me.
I really like my luggage. That's exactly what it is - luggage.
know how much time you lose checking in?
I don't know. Five...10 minutes? - 35 minutes a flight.
I travel 270 days a year. That's 157 hours.
that makes seven days. Willing to throw away an entire week on that?
you don't need this. Sorry, you don't need that.
you don't need that. They have neck pillows on the plane.
this - they have better ones there. I'll get rid of this.
I can just meet you at security.
thank you.
bingo - Asians.
you can't be serious. - Never get behind people with infants.
I've never seen a stroller collapse in less than 20 minutes.
old people are worse. They're littered with hidden metal and they never appreciate how little time they have left on earth.
five words: randomly selected for additional screening.
asians, they pack light, travel efficiently, and they've got a thing for slip-on shoes.
what in your backpack? Ryan Bigham.
are you mad at your computer?
I type with purpose.
what is it that you're working on so furiously?
I'm building a workflow of firing techniques.
it's questions and responses, actions and reactions.
a script taking you through the steps of firing someone.
who's it for?
well, theoretically, you could put it in the hands of anyone and they'd be downsizing immediately.
all you have to do is follow the steps.
Natalie, what is it you think we do here?
we prepare the newly-unemployed for the emotional and physical hurdles of job hunting, while minimising legal blowback.
that's what we're selling. It's not what we're doing.
OK, what are we doing? - We are here to make limbo tolerable, to ferry wounded souls across the river of dread until the point where hope is dimly visible.
then stop the boat, shove them in the water and make them swim.
that's really impressive. Are you gonna put that in your book?
I gotta grab this. I'll meet you at the car rental.
Hey, I was hoping I'd hear from you.
I'm in Hotlanta and I need a rib-joint recommend bad.
fat Matt's. Bring a bib.
you never called. - I wasn't sure what was appropriate.
appropriate? I'm not some waitress you banged in a snowstorm.
that word has no place in our vocabulary.
I'm the woman that you don't have to worry about.
sounds like a trap. - Listen...
the next time that you're worried about manners, don't.
if you wanna call, call. Just think of me as yourself, only with a vagina.
when am I gonna see you?
well, I'm out of Hartsfield into IAD, with a connection in ORD into SDF.
sorry.
Yeah, tell me about it.
how long's your layover? They got multiples into SDF. Could you push?
Yeah, I can push.
all you have to do today is watch and listen.
and when I talk about a strategy packet, hand them one of those.
sounds great.
so although I wish I were here with better news, the fact is that you and I are sitting here today because this will be your last week of employment at this company.
why me? - What am I supposed to do now?
am I supposed to feel better I'm not the only one losing my job?
this is ridiculous! I have been a fine employee for over 10 years and this is the way you treat me.
how do you sleep at night, man? How?
how's your family? They sleeping well at night?
electricity still on?
heat still on, refrigerator full of food?
gas tank full of gas?
going to Chuck E. Cheese this weekend or something?
not me.
no, my kids, we're not gonna do anything.
what do you suggest I tell them?
perhaps you're underestimating the positive effect your career transition can have on your children.
the positive effect?
I make about 90 grand a year now.
unemployment is what - 250 bucks a week?
is that one of your positive effects?
we'll get to be cosier cause I'm not gonna be able to pay my mortgage on my house.
so maybe we can move into a nice fucking one-bedroom apartment somewhere.
and I guess without benefits,
I'll be able to hold my daughter as she, you know, suffers from her asthma that I won't be able to afford the medication for.
Well...tests have shown that children under moderate trauma have a tendency to apply themselves academically...
.as a method of coping.
go fuck yourself.
that's what my kids'll think.
your children's admiration is important to you? - Yeah.
Yeah, it was.
well, I doubt they ever admired you, Bob.
Hey, asshole, aren't you supposed to be consoling me?
I'm not a shrink, Bob. I'm a wake-up call.
you know why kids love athletes? - Cos they screw lingerie models?
no, that's why we love athletes. Kids love athletes because they follow their dreams.
well, I can't dunk. - No, but you can cook.
what are you talking about?
most students, they work on the fryer at KFC, but you bussed tables at Il Picador to support yourself.
then you get out of college and then you come and work here.
how much did they first pay you to give up on your dreams?
27 grand a year. - And when were you going to stop and come back and do what makes you happy?
good question.
I see guys who work at the same company for their entire lives, guys exactly like you.
they clock in, they clock out, and they never have a moment of happiness.
you have an opportunity here, Bob.
this is a rebirth.
if not for you, do it for your children.
he just waltzes in and cuts in line?
we reserve priority assistance for our Hilton Honors members.
the promotions are great. You should check it out.
hungry much?
our business expense allots $40 each for dinner.
I plan on grabbing as many miles as I can.
OK, you gotta fill me in on the miles thing. What is that about?
are you talking about... like frequent flyer miles?
you really want to know? - I'm dying to know.
I don't spend a nickel if I can help it unless it somehow profits my mileage account.
so what are you saving up for - Hawaii, South of France?
it's not like that. The miles are the goal.
that's it?
you're saving just to save?
just say I have a number in mind and I haven't hit it yet.
that's a little abstract. What's the target?
I'd rather not. - Is it a secret target?
it's 10 million miles.
OK. Isn't 10 million just a number? - Pi's just a number.
well, we all need a hobby.
no, I... I don't mean to belittle your collection. I get it. It sounds cool.
I'd be the seventh person to do it. More people have walked on the moon.
do they throw you a parade? - You get lifetime executive status, you get to meet the chief pilot, Maynard Finch...
and they put your name on a plane.
men get hard-ons putting their name on stuff. You guys don't grow up.
it's like you need to pee on everything. - Now who's stereotyping?
fear of mortality. It's like, yeah, you're gonna die one day.
why is that singular to men?
probably because you can't have babies. - The baby argument.
if I had that many miles...
I would show up at an airport, look at the destination board, pick a place and go.
can't fall asleep.
me too just laying here
you should rub one out.
thank you for the advice.
only fair if you do too
way ahead of you.
call me next tim so I can listen
have sweet dreams about me.
OK. Closer. Way closer.
still closer.
closer.
Er...a little left.
down a little.
too far. Up. Up one more inch.
I don't get it. Why does your sister want a fake photo?
my sister is kooky. She thinks this is charming. It's like the gnome thing.
no, I mean, why would she want a fake photo in front of St Louis airport?
are you kidding - Lambert Field? The Wright brothers flew through there.
that domed main terminal, is the first of its kind, a precursor of everything from JFK to de Gaulle.
pretty sweet. - Just take the picture.
well, that's a keeper.
let me see it.
why she wants reminders of all the places she hasn't been is beyond me.
I'm sure she'll be crushed for having missed this airport.
before Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic, he took off from that runway.
wonder why they called it the Spirit of St Louis?
no. - Well...
do you know how fucked this place is now?
I am the one thing - the one thing
preventing this place from being totally fucked in the ass.
sometimes they just need to vent.
please, for the love of God, can I fire the next one?
miss Barnes, thank you for joining us. - I'm here to be fired, right?
well, we're here to talk about your future.
you don't have to sugar-coat it. I get the drill.
what are they offering?
inside the packet, you'll find a clearly worked out severance package.
give me the bullet points.
it's actually pretty good
three months' pay, six months' medical.
and a full year of placement services through our CTC.
placement services. That's generous.
commonly it takes a month of searching for every $10, 000 you expect to earn in salary.
so I could be looking for a while. - Not necessarily.
don't even sweat it. I'm pretty confident about my plans.
Really? - Yeah.
there's this beautiful bridge by my house.
I'm gonna go jump off it.
Hey!
people say these things all the time. It's part of the trade.
they do? - Yeah.
they say crazy things. They get worked up.
she was really calm.
I think that's a good sign.
so they don't ever actually do it? - No. No, it's just talk.
how do you know? Do you follow up? - No, nothing good's gonna come of that, but.
I wouldn't worry about it.
this is what we do, Natalie. We take people at their most fragile and we set them adrift.
ready to go back in?
all right, let's go. Come on.
no, I'm fine. Tell me something sweet.
I'll be back soon. I'm not sure how long this exercise is supposed to last.
no, I don't even think of him that way. He's old.
I- I'm done? - I wasn't expecting this. Not at all.
just like that?
I'm disappointed that I've given so much of my life...
this is not fair.
there are people way more qualified than me now.
I don't know what to do when I wake up tomorrow.
you OK?
are we going? - Yeah.
this is how I start every day of my life.
now, this is gonna be a little difficult, so stay with me.
you have a new backpack.
only this time, I want you to fill it with people.
start with casual acquaintances, friends of friends, folks around the office.
and then the people you trust with your most intimate secrets
your cousins, your aunts, your uncles, your brothers, your sisters, your parents, and finally your husband, your wife, your boyfriend or your girlfriend.
you get them into that backpack.
don't worry. I'm not gonna ask you to light it on fire.
feel the weight of that bag.
make no mistake, your relationships are the heaviest components in your life.
do you feel the straps cutting into your shoulders?
all those negotiations and arguments, and secrets and compromises.
you don't need to carry all that weight.
why don't you set that bag down?
some animals were meant to carry each other, to live symbiotically for a lifetime
star-crossed lovers, monogamous swans. We are not those animals.
the slower we move, the faster we die.
we are not swans.
we're sharks.
never? - No.
ever? - No.
you never want to get married? - Nope.
never want kids? - Not a chance.
ever? - Never.
is that so bizarre? - Yes.
Yes, it is. - I just don't see the value in it.
right, sell it to me. - What?
sell me marriage.
OK, how about love? - OK.
stability, just somebody you can count on... - How many stable marriages do you know?
somebody to talk to, someone to spend your life with.
I'm surrounded by people to talk to. That won't change.
how about just not dying alone?
starting when I was 12, we moved each of my grandparents to a nursing facility.
my parents went the same way. Make no mistake, we all die alone.
now, those cult members in San Diego, with the Kool-Aid and the sneakers...
they didn't die alone.
I'm just saying there are options.
Oh, fuck.
Brian left me.
all right.
OK. Ok. All right.
all right. Shh, shh.
Natalie, this is Alex, my friend. This is Natalie.
I should give you both a moment.
no. No, that's fine. I'm fine. It's a pleasure to meet you.
maybe we should just all go up to our rooms and freshen up.
maybe a drink? - Now you're talking.
Brian: I think it's time we C other people
he broke up with you with a text message?
kind of like firing someone over the internet.
what a weaselly prick. - But what does that make me?
someone who falls for a prick. - We all fall for them.
pricks are spontaneous, unpredictable and fun.
then we're surprised when they turn out to be pricks.
I followed him to Omaha. - You did?
I had a job waiting for me in San Francisco when he got an offer from ConAgra.
he said we could start a life together.
so I followed him. - To Nebraska?
I thought I'd be engaged by now.
no offence.
none taken. - That's all right.
when I was 16, I thought by 23 I'd be married, maybe have a kid, corner office by day, entertaining at night.
I was supposed to be driving a Grand Cherokee by now.
life can underwhelm you that way.
I mean, where did you think you'd be by um...
it doesn't work that way. - At a certain point, you stop with the deadlines.
it can be counterproductive.
I don't want to say anything anti-feminist.
I really appreciate all your generation did for me.
it was our pleasure. - Well done.
but sometimes it feels like, no matter how much success I have, it's not gonna matter until I find the right guy.
you really thought this guy was the one?
I could have made it work.
he um... He really fit the bill.
you know? - The bill?
white collar, college grad.
loves dogs, likes funny movies. Six-foot-one, brown hair, kind eyes, works in finance but is outdoorsy... you know, on the weekends.
I always imagined he'd have a single syllable name like Matt or John...
or Dave.
in a perfect world, he drives a 4Runner, and the only thing he loves more than me is his golden lab.
and a nice smile.
what about you? - Let me think.
honestly, by the time you're 34, all the physical requirements go out the window.
like you secretly pray that he'll be taller than you.
not an asshole would be nice. Someone who enjoys my company, comes from a good family.
you don't think about that when you're younger.
I don't know... someone who wants kids.
likes kids. Wants kids
healthy enough to play with his kids.
please let him earn more money than I do.
you might not understand that now, but believe me, you will one day.
otherwise that's a recipe for disaster.
and hopefully some hair on his head.
but I mean even that's not a deal breaker these days.
a nice smile.
Yeah, a nice smile. Nice smile just might do it.
wow, that was depressing.
I should just date women. - Tried it.
we're no picnic ourselves.
I don't mind being married to my career.
and I don't expect it to hold me in bed as I fall asleep.
I just don't want to settle.
you're young. Right now you see settling as some sort of a failure.
it is...by definition.
but by the time someone is right for you, it won't feel like settling.
and the only person left to judge you will be the 23-year-old girl with a target on your back.
so what's the plan for the evening?
well, we were gonna hit that party for the tech conference at the hotel.
I didn't know you could just attend those. I thought you had to register.
technically, I don't think it's open to the public.
stop by. - You're gonna crash it?
have a good time, usually. - No, no, I get it. I'm in.
shit! - Ah, it'll be fine.
doing all right?
Yeah. This was a great idea.
you're so pretty.
you're exactly what I wanna look like in 15 years.
thank you, Natalie. - You should dance.
come on. - No, no, no.
come on. - Oh!
the universe.
so full of wonders.
I can spend hours and hours looking up at the sky.
so many stars, so many mysteries.
and there's one very special star that makes me think of one very special person.
let me tell you my story.
at the dawn of time, from the chaos came an exception.
one of the most mysterious secrets of the universe.
you see, I come from that very mysterious and unique place.
we are the only known solar system with double gravity.
two twin planets whirling together around one sun, but each with its own and opposite gravity.
now, in our world, it's possible to fall up and to rise down.
but my story, it's about love.
some people say that true lovers are one soul that is separated when it's born, and those two halves will always yearn to find their way back together.
well, to understand my story, you're going to need to know the three basic laws of double gravity.
all matter, every single object is pulled by the gravity of the world that it comes from, and not the other.
an object's weight can be offset using matter from the opposite world.
inverse matter.
but the problem is, after a few hours of contact, matter in contact with inverse matter burns.
these laws are as old as the universe itself.
they are unchangeable, and there are no exceptions.
gravity.
they say you can't fight it.
well, I disagree.
what if love was stronger than gravity?
let's go back to the dark times when any contact between worlds was extremely dangerous and totally forbidden.
up Top had grown rich and prosperous, while here, Down Below, we stole inverse matter from Up Top to heat our homes and to survive, risking everything, even our own lives.
I think he's dead.
Hey! Come here.
the only authorized contact between worlds was through Transworld, a giant corporation Up Top, created to take cheap oil from Down Below, and to sell back to us overpriced electricity that we couldn't afford.
because of Transworld,
I grew up in an orphanage.
you see, my parents died in the Big Blast, a Transworld oil refinery explosion that destroyed much of the city.
fortunately, there were the weekends.
they let me visit my great aunt Becky, my only surviving relative.
as well as Becky, there were two things that I truly loved:
model airplanes and Becky's flying pancakes.
you're going to have to get me some more pink pollen tomorrow, okay, sweetie?
Becky also initiated me into an ancient knowledge passed down over the generations through the women of our family.
now catch.
the secret of the pink bees.
Becky, how do they do that?
it's all in this book.
it was passed down to my mother from hers and, of course, I would have given it to your mother.
one day, when you grow up, it'll be yours.
Becky would often send me to gather pink pollen from the Sage Mountains.
this was the only place, and a forbidden place, where pink bees could be found.
bees that fed off flowers from both worlds, and without whom this story could never have happened.
but I had a little secret of my own.
I used to go chase inverse rain from Up Top.
one day, I went much further than usual, climbing higher and higher above the cloud line.
and that day, well, that day changed my life forever.
Hey!
Hi.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, where have you been? I've been waiting ages for you.
our neighbors got robbed. They're saying it was a thief from Down Below.
there's hunters with guns, and border patrol trucks.
are you serious?
don't make that face.
I made it here, right?
well, look, as long as you're okay.
Hey, look, I'll throw it up.
all right, ready?
all right, Adam.
are you tied on?
I'm good. - Yeah?
okay, I'm pulling now.
don't drop me.
you know, these ones from Up Top are so good.
they're the best. - Oh, they are. They're amazing.
wait, I got something for you, too.
and this is from both worlds. - What is it?
I can't tell you. You got to close your eyes.
cIose your eyes. Come on.
like, closed, closed. - They're closed.
all right.
are they closed?
okay. Okay, open your mouth.
I can't reach.
how is that from both worlds?
I don't know, you should probably ask the bees.
I don't know.
imagine if we could go anywhere we wanted to.
I mean, really.
can you imagine that?
Hey, you know what?
what? - Well, we can.
come on, let's imagine we can.
let's go down.
you're holding on?
I'm ready! Three, two, one, go!
I got... I got down.
Oh, you're holding on?
Yeah. Oh, my God!
pull my legs down.
I got it. I got it.
okay, spin!
okay, just spin! Just spin!
look at the branch.
shall we go again? - Uh-huh.
it's the biggest one ever. - All right, I'm ready.
hold on? - Yeah.
coming down.
all right. You good? - Uh-huh.
okay, you want to do another spin?
Yeah, let's get really high. Let's see if we can get higher this time.
did you hear that?
Yeah.
you know, we should go.
he's there.
let's get him.
quick, Adam!
Ah.
Ah! Adam!
Eden! Eden!
No! No!
No! No, please! Please, no!
come on.
Becky! Becky! Becky, I'm sorry!
I'm so sorry. - No! Adam! No!
No! Adam!
Becky! - Adam!
No! No! No!
Becky! - Adam, you did nothing wrong!
nothing!
Becky!
No! Becky!
please, no! No!
Becky!
Adam, come on, stop! Make us a plane!
make us a plane. Come on.
I can't. - Make us a plane.
I've got to go to work. - Come on.
I've got to go to work. I'll do it later.
Hey, Mr. Jones.
Transworld.
only one week left to submit your application.
you've got to play to win.
Hello, Albert.
Mrs. Nathanson.
what do you got for me?
inverse matter to pay my debt.
will this cover it?
my husband says it's stainless steel from the main pipeline.
Pablo, it's ready!
okay, don't start it until it's fully applied.
okay.
okay, now we go.
Wow. That stuff is amazing.
is it for sale?
well, not quite yet.
Nah.
we're all settled.
thank you. And can you keep me posted on that beauty cream?
will do.
you take care now.
did you hear that, Adam?
we have got to finish this cream.
well, I would love to, Albert, you know, but... with this equipment, you know, it could take years.
a chance to fulfill everyone's dream and transform his life working for Transworld.
we're live Down Below with our nine finalists feverishly awaiting the results.
I'd like to welcome Miss Eden Moore from Transpublicity, a division of Transworld.
Hi. How are you?
Hi. - Welcome.
thank you.
now, she'll tell us more about what she does, but more importantly, let's hear about our winner's new job.
well, our division handles all of Transworld's graphic design needs.
right now I'm working with origami specifically
that sounds fascinating, but our audience is dying to know just what job will our winner be getting.
well, today we're offering the winner a job in our department.
here we go. Let's choose our lucky winner.
I can't believe it. - What?
that's her.
number two. - Pablo, that's Eden.
are you sure? - I'm totally sure.
she's alive. I can't believe it.
I can find her, man. She works at Transworld.
attention. This is the final call.
doors will be closing in five minutes.
stay in line.
prepare jackets and personal objects for weigh-in.
please remove jackets and empty your pockets of personal belongings for weigh-in.
put your jacket in the bin as well.
stay in line.
prepare jackets and personal objects for weigh-in.
please remove jackets...
1. 65 pounds.
don't move.
new? - Yeah.
what floor? - Floor Zero.
name? - Adam Kirk.
Thanks.
need some help?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm looking for a Station 15, Sector 8.
third aisle down.
thank you.
I told you.
do not ever do that again. You understand me?
Hey.
welcome aboard, newbie.
Cheers. - Cheers.
goddammit. God.
I'm so, so sorry.
like, I had no idea it was going to do that.
don't worry, my friend, they do that to all the newbies.
Oh, great. Good start.
name's Bob. Bob Boruchowitz.
and you are?
I'm Adam. Adam Kirk.
Mr. Kirk?
please follow me. The Managing Director is waiting to see you.
right, sure, okay.
psst, hey, hey. Your back.
your back, check it out. 0000
Oh, right, that's...
that's pretty funny.
ho, ho. - Mr. Kirk.
we don't have much time.
come see me on your way out with a list of materials you'll require for your work.
I need you to complete your security clearance form.
I'll also give you your various access badges and meal vouchers.
come in, Mr. Kirk.
come in, come in.
this anti-aging cream idea of yours seems to be quite promising.
your application has been approved, but this is strictly on a trial basis, you understand.
well, of course.
have a seat, please.
Thanks.
fasten your seat belt, Mr. Kirk.
I'm... I'm sorry?
your seatbelt?
seatbelt. Oh, right.
are there any questions, Mr. Kirk?
Yeah, I was just wondering what all these people on my side do?
mm, they're merely adapters.
they adapt our products to your world.
you, on the other hand, have a real opportunity here.
company policy doesn't normally allow for someone from Down Below to hold such an important position, but we're making an exception in your case.
sign here, please.
now then, a word of warning.
we scrupulously observe a full separation between worlds here.
that means there is to be no unnecessary contact with those Up Top.
just stick to your job and all will be well.
one last thing.
the rules are quite strict here.
as you know, you'll be working with upper world materials.
this means that you'll be thoroughly searched and weighed every time that you leave the premises.
if they find any inverse matter on you, you'll be fired and jailed on the spot.
but I have a feeling that this won't happen in your case.
will it, Mr. Kirk?
no, sir.
try not to prove me wrong.
right then, dismissed.
another massive oil leak has developed, following a metal robbery from the main pipeline, forcing Transworld to double their security.
the three thieves from Down Below arrested last week were hanged this morning at dawn, raising interworld tensions.
here is a senior Transworld executive with a statement.
they got what they deserved.
we don't go down to their world.
we certainly don't want them coming up to ours.
nice boss you got there.
and that's tonight's news on TTW7.
thank you for watching us.
Adam, you did not have to do this.
I could've gotten you that patent. Transworld...
Transworld is the worst thing that ever happened to us.
and what, now you're one of them?
come on, Albert. - Those people are vultures.
and you're going to give them your golden goose for peanuts?
I mean, we have nothing.
Yeah, we're from Down Below. I mean, that's just the way it is.
I mean, we have nothing.
don't you tell me I'm nothing!
this isn't nothing. This is everything.
and I gave you everything.
I treated you like you were my own son.
and you know what you're going to do?
you're going to go up there and you're going to get yourself killed.
that's all you're going to do, is get yourself killed.
shit.
what?
Albert. Albert, come on.
look, I didn't mean it like that.
Albert, please, come on.
all right.
don't you dare think that I've forgotten that Transworld took away my entire family.
all right?
look, if I could use Transworld and Aunt Becky's pink powder just to,
I don't know, just give my life some kind of hope, then I'm going to do it.
come on Albert, please.
come on, I need your help. Albert, please.
come on.
all right, all right.
okay, today we have someone joining us for the first time.
Hello, Eden. - Hi.
Hi.
Hi, I'm Eden. Eden Moore.
um, I had an accident when I was a teenager.
uh, everything before that is gone.
sometimes things come back to me in dreams, but I'm never sure if they're real or if I'm making them up.
it's frustrating.
you know, I know that whatever's missing, it's in there.
Ah, but it scares me.
um, mostly it just feels like something's missing.
Mr. Kirk? - Yes.
here is the key to your personal refrigeration system.
and here's your very first allocation - of inverse matter. - Okay, great.
be careful. Without cooling, it gets hot very fast.
thank you.
Hey. Not exactly a charmer, is he?
Oh.
one o'clock. Lunch time.
I usually go to the smoking room after I've eaten.
why don't you drop by?
we'll have a little conversation.
okay, sure.
Oh, hey, Bob? - Mm?
you mind if I come in? - Mm.
come in, come in. Sit down. Hey.
you want a cigar? You smoke?
no, no, no. No, thanks. I don't smoke.
okay, fine, sit down.
see?
empty.
no one smokes in Transworld any more.
Yeah, well I do, so "pbblt."
you know, people have a funny way of seeing things here.
anything or anyone different is, well, let's say, frowned upon.
can I ask you a favor?
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
could you get me some stamps?
some stamps?
Yeah, stamps.
I, uh, I don't like to boast, but I've got one of the largest known stamp collections Up Top.
and if you can get me some from your side, oh, boy.
right, yeah.
I mean, sure, I guess.
great. Great.
so, you were saying, anti-gravity?
Yeah, you know, I've been working on this, uh...
it's an anti-aging cream. - Mm-hm.
well, I'm here if you need me.
expert in conductivity and computer programming.
anything you need, anything, just ask.
well then, uh,
I guess there could be something you could help me with.
I was wondering if you might be able to get me in touch with an employee... Up Top?
up Top?
Yeah.
her name's, uh,
Eden Moore.
sure.
sure.
so, what's your plan?
I don't know, yet.
I'm working on that.
I mean, but you've seen her though, right?
no, I mean, I haven't actually seen her but...
but she's there, Pablo.
I mean, she's just like a few floors above.
are you sure this is worth it?
I mean, it's been, like, ten years since you last saw her.
Yeah, it's worth it.
it's amazing. Oh, man, the man with no head.
I can't believe it.
move, please.
so, what kind of shirt do you want?
do you want, like, a sport shirt, a T-shirt? - No.
you want a button-down collar?
Yeah, a normal button-down shirt.
you want a jacket? - Yeah, I don't know, a suit jacket.
stay in line.
you may proceed, Mr. Kirk.
thank you.
now, this should be happening any moment now.
if you watch carefully.
here it comes.
how long does the effect last?
well, right now, really only, like, a few minutes.
but we've been working on... - Clearly long enough.
soon we'll begin clinical trials on human subjects.
obviously, we'll start with a sample of women from Down Below.
I need quick results. I'm counting on you.
Oh. Is that beauty cream for Halloween?
no, they've got different standards of beauty Down Below.
the uglier the better.
Hey. Don't let those guys get to you.
they're just jealous, that's all.
you, uh, you're staying late?
Yeah, you know, I thought I'd stay and just finish up a few things, you know.
right. Well, I'll take her back to the kennel for you.
come on, girl.
Hey, you... you realize they don't pay overtime, right?
Yeah, I know.
okay, right. See you tomorrow.
don't work too hard.
I won't.
Hello?
Yes, it is.
no, I'm sorry, she's gone home for the night.
Yeah, you can come by tomorrow.
okay, what's your name again?
Bo-ru-chowitz.
thank you.
okay. See you tomorrow.
believe me, Adam, it's going to burn.
in a pinch, just use a little water to cool down.
PIease, remember you won't last an hour with these counterweights on.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know, I know, I know.
what, Pablo, what?
what is it?
all right, what's your plan?
huh? you dress up in disguise, you show up to meet her, and then what?
then what? I don't know.
you don't know. - No, I don't know.
all right, let me get this straight, okay?
she sees you, all right?
she throws herself in your arms, says she loves you, - and she never forgot about you. - Yeah, maybe.
okay, then, since you're starting to burn up, you tell her you love her, too, but you really have to go, and if you don't get caught or shot, maybe you'll see her again in ten years.
besides, what...
you really think she, uh, she just waited for you?
Yeah, I do. - You do?
Yeah, actually, I do. - Adam, we're from Down Below.
okay, don't you get that?
besides, you know what?
I bet she calls the cops the second she sees you.
come on, all right? She's not going to call the cops.
Adam, you're so delusional.
why... why are you so obsessed with those people anyway, huh?
you know, my brother was the same way.
Yeah, he went up there and...
he never came back.
you want to end up like him?
God.
Hey, Eden. It's... it's Adam.
it's Adam.
Oh, God.
who's there?
possible breach.
Ah.
Eden.
eden, it's... it's me.
Oh, yes, Mr. Boruchowitz, right?
I'll be with you. One second.
wait. Come on, Eden.
Hi. I'm Paula. We spoke on the phone yesterday.
I didn't realize you guys knew each other.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we do.
I mean, I can't believe she would just ignore me like that.
no. No, she just forgets things.
what do you mean?
it's her amnesia.
wait. She... she has amnesia?
Yes, since her accident.
will you cut these, too? - Yeah.
you wanted to see me?
Yeah, yeah, no, I did.
look, Eden, I thought that we...
I thought that, uh, that, uh, that this product that I've been working on,
I thought it might be of some interest to you, professionally speaking.
Yeah. Oh, would you...
can I... can I show you?
Yeah, sure. It's just a mock-up.
it takes a second to work, so...
okay.
you know, I...
I've, uh, I've been working with this... this young man who's just recently started here at Transworld.
but he had like a troubled childhood.
Yeah, he grew up in a, like, an orphanage.
Oh, that's terrible.
Yeah, you know, his Aunt Becky was, like, his only real family.
well, you should have brought him.
Yeah. Well, um, the truth is that he couldn't come.
Oh, why not?
well, cause...
he's from Down Below.
sorry, sorry. I'm sorry.
I just don't know why you're telling me this.
right. Anyway, I thought the product might be of some use.
that's amazing. - Yeah.
it's perfectly straight. What is this stuff?
it's top secret actually.
I like secrets. - Yeah?
are you okay? - Yeah. No, I'm good.
are you sure? - Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah.
I'm pretty good. - Wait. You're sweating.
Oh, really? God. Look at that. - Do you want a Translenol?
no, not really. I'm... I'm good. I'm pretty good.
you know what? Can you just excuse me for, like, just one second?
okay. - I'll be back.
I'll be right back.
that was funny.
Ah. Ah.
Hey! Hey, you!
he's not coming back.
do you believe it? - No, I don't.
but he is cute though.
I know. - Mm-hm.
you know, I hate to say it, but I told you she wouldn't remember you.
Pablo, please.
she's got amnesia. After all that?
boy, you sure know how to pick them.
you burned yourself pretty good there, too.
put some more of that on tonight when you go to bed.
okay.
everything all right, Mr. Kirk?
Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Everything's... everything's fine.
just, you know, cleaning up a few things.
here's the list of candidates for your clinical trials.
Oh. Oh, great.
thank you.
I'll come by at the end of the day for your selections.
Psst. Hey. May I see?
sure.
Ooh. Man.
jeez, with models like that, your goose is cooked, man.
what are they trying to do, get you fired or what? - I don't know, maybe.
showtime.
what do you mean showtime? What's that?
Oh, you'll see, you know.
you just started here. You'll be out of the line of fire.
your attention, please.
before we begin handing out the bonuses, we have a list of individuals whose services will no longer be required.
Albert Midwall.
Susan Gonzales. John Phelps.
believe me, my friend, if your thing works out, you've got nothing to worry about.
you'll be great, believe me. - Jimmy Scotch.
Beatrice Amuchastegue.
Bob Boruchowitz.
mistake. - Alexis Vonarb.
that's a mistake. - Aton Soumache.
um, excuse me, I'm sorry.
did you say Bob Boruchowitz?
well, I think that's a mistake, yeah?
there is no mistake, Mr. Boruchowitz.
in light of your seniority, you will be given a retirement package.
but your Transworld contract has been terminated.
Jeff Duhaim.
emiliano Grassi.
Dimitri Rassam.
Oscar Lopez.
steven Craig.
don't ever trust anyone here, Adam. They're all a bunch of snakes.
that's it? I mean, you just pack up your things and leave?
thirty-one years.
they toss you out like a bag of garbage.
Yep. That's the Transworld way.
now, this is for your collection.
some things in here may come in handy.
you're ready? - Yeah.
okay and...
I got it. I got it.
Hey, Bob.
I'm... I'm really sorry.
don't worry about me, my friend.
it's their loss.
right.
take care of yourself, all right?
right.
come on, old girl, we're out of here. You're coming with me.
knowing these jerks, you'd probably end up in a tin can.
come on, girl. Come on.
Hey, Bob.
thank you.
out of office. Leave your message.
Hi, Bob. It's Eden Moore calling you.
I was just wondering what happened the other day.
you just rushed out of here so quickly.
eden, Eden. Hi, hi. Hey, it's Bob.
what happened to you?
listen, I'm so, so sorry for disappearing on you like that.
you know what?
an alarm went off and the security had everything blocked, - so I was stuck there for hours. - Uh-huh.
no, no, really. I mean, I've been desperate to call you.
I've been meaning to call you.
all right, well, I'll let you make it up to me.
take me to lunch?
Oh. What?
Yeah, you can come up with a better story by then.
you... you want to go to the cafeteria?
no, I thought we could eat out.
eat out?
Yeah. You don't want to?
no, no, no, no. I'd love to.
okay, great.
how about Cafe Dos Mundos. You know it?
Yes, of course.
Wow.
the Cafe Dos Mundos.
is that a problem?
no, no. No problem at all.
okay, great. I'll see you tomorrow at noon.
okay, great. - All right. See you then.
Bye. - Bye.
you know, I got to admit
I've always wondered what it would be Iike.
Yeah, well, maybe now you'll know.
all right, Pablo, if I could get you one thing, one thing from Up Top, what would it be?
one thing? - Yeah.
a girl. - A girl?
I don't know, bring me back all the menus from the restaurant.
Yeah, okay, I can do that.
what about you, Albert?
Yeah, I want you back.
okay, I'll try to make sure that happens.
okay.
welcome to Transworld.
today, it's 21 degrees, a beautiful and sunny day in Transcity.
Transworld wishes you a very lovely day.
Transoil. Energy for a better life.
we're building your future.
Hi. - Eden, hey.
Hi, Bob. - Hey, how are you?
good.
I'm so sorry I'm late.
don't worry about it. I just got here. - You did? Oh, good.
so, how come I've never seen you around Transworld before?
well, I mean, it's a... it's a pretty big company.
I don't know, maybe that's why. - That's true.
do you live nearby?
me? No, no. God, no.
uh, I... I have a really long commute.
you know, I'm sorry, like...
you really, you really don't remember me?
I mean, you know, if you look at me,
I mean, like, really, really look at me.
you don't remember me at all?
no?
come on, Eden.
eden, we know each other.
what are you doing? - No, Iike, we really know each other.
why are you doing this to me?
what? No, Eden.
eden, please.
eden, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
come on. Sorry. PIease. PIease, don't leave.
look, it was just a misunderstanding.
I just meant that we met before.
you know, it was at the elevator at work?
you dropped your papers and I helped you pick them up.
you don't remember that? - No, I don't.
Yeah, why... why would you, I guess.
look, I'm sorry.
I'm kind of just a little nervous, that's all.
you know, I didn't mean to come at you like that.
I'm really sorry.
look, can you forgive me?
I should get back to work, I think.
can we just stay for one drink?
you can't stay for one drink?
we don't even have to eat.
you know, I'm not even hungry.
unless of course you're hungry, in which case I'm... I'm starving.
Yeah, I mean, I'll eat the whole menu twice if... if you just sit down and have lunch with me.
I'm starving, actually. - Yeah? Good.
you want to sit down?
this is an Upside Down? - I have to teach you how to drink this now.
I don't even know how... how do you... So...
what am I supposed to do?
you have to put it to your lips like this.
okay.
and just tilt it down.
what? - That's it.
how could you not know? - For a year. For a year.
exactly. Let's do it again.
okay.
these are good. - Yeah.
they are good. - You got to take it easy though.
all right. - They're strong.
Hey, you know, I want to show you something. - Sure.
it's a personal project of mine, but I want to do it on a much larger scale, but I thought your invention could come in handy.
Wow. Wow, that's, that's amazing, really.
yeah? - Yeah, it's amazing.
I mean, I'd Iove to help. yeah.
that's the... the Sage Mountains, right?
Yeah.
I, um, I grew up there.
we still have our old house there.
Yeah, no, God. We used to go there all the time, you know.
we used to go and pick the pomegranates.
Yeah, me, too. - Yeah.
they're the best. - Yeah, they're the best.
are you okay?
huh? Yeah, no, I'm good.
I'm fine. No, really. - All right.
it's getting a little warm in here, don't you think?
let's get out of here.
you want to go? - Yeah.
Yeah, sure. We'll get the check?
Yeah. Okay.
so, there's this great orchestra from Down Below.
uh, they play here Friday nights.
they're incredible. You have to hear it.
wow, that, that sounds great.
okay, so I'II see you Friday, maybe?
Yeah, sure. Okay. - Okay.
Bye. - Bye.
thanks for lunch. - All right. Take care.
Thanks.
Eden.
eden, it's me.
our demonstrator will apply the full product line.
we'll be selling five separate creams of increasing strengths according to the concentration of the active ingredient.
five being the most potent.
the goal is to tailor the lift to the condition of the various facial regions.
and as you see, a range of strengths allows the consumer to apply what's needed where needed.
for a general purpose product, I think the level two will provide visible all-around improvement without any adverse effects.
number five, being the strongest, can work miracles.
and speaking of miracles, now we are also developing a product for the breasts and the buttocks.
Oh, I think it's ready.
Bravo. Bravo.
any questions before we continue?
Yes. Couldn't we market a cheaper version for Down Below with only one product?
Yes, we could, at the very lightest concentration.
the product doesn't hold up well at very high doses.
let's see what happens with excessive application.
she had our product applied about ten minutes ago, so...
I have a question for the demonstrator.
Mr. Boruchowitz, right?
uh, I'm... I'm sorry.
you must have me confused with somebody else.
my name's Adam.
Adam·Kirk.
excuse me, I'm looking for Eden Moore.
have you seen her? - Yeah, she just Ieft.
no. No.
damn it.
Hey! Stop!
security breach, tower two.
Transworld. For a better, brighter tomorrow.
stop him!
gravity, a revolution about to begin.
new, from Transcosmetics.
uplift yourself today.
Hey.
what are you doing here?
I'm looking for my dog.
what's your name?
I can't talk to you.
why not?
you're from Down Below.
I'm Adam.
you son of a gun.
I knew you were up to something.
Bob, can I come in?
of course, that's what I'm here for. Come on, come on.
you see, men, we're like real estate agents.
and we buy, we sell, keep our options open.
women, well, they're more like contractors.
you know, they build to last.
you see the difference?
Yeah. Yes, I think so.
Oh, you will. You will, my friend.
right, right. Well, I'm adding maximum weight to the exterior layer to counteract the heating problem.
now, my friend, try this for size.
if it fits, you are through with overheating.
this is nice.
Bob, wow, this is nice.
Oh, boy, oh, boy.
Transworld are going to curse the day they fired me.
Yeah, look at that. - You got it?
that's a pretty good fit. - Good, good.
right, well, I'm going to get back to the outer layer, the icing on the cake.
I don't get it.
it's impossible to change gravity's status.
are you sure?
Yeah, absolutely.
look, so now all we have to do is carefully mix the two opposing solutions.
and wait a second to stabilize gravity.
Yeah, and then...
voila.
no.
God.
that is better than a good idea, my friend.
that is... revolutionary.
but don't they have the formula now?
no.
no, I gave them everything but the main ingredient.
Oh.
I would give good money just to see the look on Lagavulin's face right now.
so, are you telling me we don't have the formula?
we...
well, we tried to recreate it several times, but the thing is, we're missing an ingredient.
a pink powder.
we found traces in his office.
without it, there is no cream.
that's unacceptable.
you can't figure it out without him?
no.
you remember?
I'm starting to.
border police.
everybody up against the wall.
ma'am, this way, please.
damn it.
listen, I got to go. - No.
identification. - I'II find you.
Hey, you. There he is.
come back here. Stop. Stop.
what's he doing?
don't let him get away.
I'm going to the left.
I spot him.
stay where you are. Go, go, go.
breaking news coming in live.
border police have launched a massive manhunt for the fugitive who just escaped from the Cafe Dos Mundos.
all national law enforcement agencies have been alerted, and we will keep you updated as the story develops.
come on, let's go.
wait, wait, wait...
wait, wait, wait...
what?
I... I just thought I heard something.
you okay? - Yeah.
there's somebody there. Go, go, go, go.
Hey, you! Stop!
eden, come on.
come on, come on, come on. - Don't let them get away.
go, go, go, go!
eden, the weights. Come on, take off my weights.
take them off.
eden, come on.
okay.
Eden. Eden, take this arm.
Oh, God.
hold on. Hold on.
eden, hold on.
please, hold on.
hold on.
don't let go. I'm holding you.
don't let go.
hold on. Hold on.
let go of me. - No.
please. - No, don't.
I'm so sorry. - No.
I'm so sorry. - No! No!
hello.
nice to have you back.
Thanks.
wait. No, no, wait.
No! No! I haven't done anything.
No!
get in the car. - No! Please!
I haven't done anything!
here's the deal. You give us the complete anti-aging cream formula, and if you attempt to contact Miss Moore, the charges against her will be reinstated.
do I make myself clear, Mr. Kirk?
so, that's it.
they won, and I lost.
I just lost everything.
they took Aunt Becky and they took Eden from me.
Oh, it's hard to accept that I will never see Eden again.
I was naive to think that I could change the world.
you know, up there, they always win.
and down here, well, we always lose.
so, I guess I just go back to my life, to my world.
and I'll try here, Down Below, to do my best.
but I will never ever forget her.
gently does it.
Yes.
victory.
so, is it true everyone's rich Up Top?
don't you know? It's total paradise up there.
paradise?
guys, I don't think so, you know.
I mean, they might be rich, sure, but... it's definitely not paradise.
Hey, let me look at that, huh?
what do you think? We should, uh, you think we should make this fly?
Yeah. - Yeah.
Yeah, yeah? We'll give it a boost?
all right, hold onto that.
all right, here we go.
all right. Now try it.
come on, throw it.
Hey, Eden. It's Paula.
are you still sick?
you haven't shown up four days.
did you get those strange flowers we sent over?
I think they came from floor zero.
let me know, okay?
I hope you're all right.
Bye.
Bob Boruchowitz?
yeah? - I'm Eden Moore.
I need your help.
Yeah, fantastic.
Bob. Bob? - What?
you think you're the only one who can go upside down?
you won't get rid of me easy as that, old buddy.
I can't believe this. How did you do it?
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
check this out.
and...
no, no, no.
did you make a vest or what?
I can't believe this.
Oh! Oh! Put me down, sweetie.
you're not even wearing a vest. Where's the weights?
no, no, no, no. We're 90% water, right?
so, I combine upper and lower inversion with a hyper infusion, yeah? Yeah.
now, you know this better than I do, but the breakthrough, man, the... the break...
Oh, man, I'm jabbering.
the problem... The problem is, right, the effect only lasts an hour, right? I have improved it.
Oh, and you, you, you my friend, hey, you have a rendezvous.
what's this?
no.
you better not go dressed like that.
Hey, did you tell him?
Hey! Another thing.
the cream, well, thanks to your stamps,
I bought the patent under the name Albert & Co.
before Transworld.
nice. Nice.
Adam.
Eden.
I can't believe it.
how did you get down here?
Bob found a way to bring me down.
I can't believe it.
but you're with me now. Really.
I... I didn't know what happened to you.
are you okay?
I'm pregnant.
we're having twins.
Oh, my God.
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it.
how long can you stay down here for?
forever, maybe.
Bob said it's because I'm pregnant.
he said you'd understand how this makes me different.
I love you.
I love you.
we didn't realize yet the repercussions of what we had done.
our love would forever alter the course of history.
but that's another story.

Mary, help.
what's going on?
do you think he would ever touch you?
No!
Willy!
get her! She's sober. She'll squeal. - Willy, get up, man.
come on, Mary!
help!
Mary!
Mary! Mary!
Mary!
come on, Mary.
we're just having some fun.
let's just talk. - Get away from me.
Hey.
come on.
it's gonna be all right. Your friends are okay. It's all right, it's okay.
it's just a little prank.
come on.
let's go check on your friends.
you stupid bitch!
Mary?
Mary.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
I'm sorry.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
there you are.
Where's the girl?
I don't know. I thought she was in here, but she's not.
shit. -- She probably passed out somewhere.
come on, we gotta find her.
that was over 30 years ago, but her rotting body is still there waiting to be discovered.
bullshit.
bullshit.
no, it's true. I swear to God. My mom told me in complete confidence.
well, complete confidence doesn't mean much when you drink vodka like it's water.
shut up.
stop it! - So you don't think it's unhealthy for them to stay home on their own homecoming?
not everybody wants to be homecoming queen.
it didn't hurt me.
you're right.
and I only wish I could've been there. -- No, you were too old and serious.
thanks a lot.
that story doesn't make any sense.
I mean, why don't the girls stick up for themselves? I don't get it.
maybe if you weren't always speaking out, like in the school newspaper...
...maybe we'd have dates to the homecoming dance.
okay, so you changed your mind.
you think it's fair football players get academic credit for going to practice?
you shouldn't have published the picture with the article.
they took the picture as a joke. You published it out of context, without...
guys. I've got another ghost story.
that wasn't a ghost story, Mindy. It's an urban legend.
an urban legend is a made-up story people keep telling as if it was true.
like the guy who eats Pop Rocks, drinks soda and his stomach explodes.
like that bullshit about Mindy's brother's camp counsellor getting his arm stuck in a soda machine, and it falls on top of him.
that wasn't bullshit.
and it was a candy machine.
Oh, and like Bloody Mary. -- Who's that?
supposedly, if you go into the bathroom and turn off the lights and chant "Bloody Mary" three times into the mirror, she appears.
her face is like a corpse. And if you look at her, well...
...then you have to turn the lights back on before she drags you in.
in where?
I don't know. In the mirror?
I heard she'll haunt you forever.
that's not even a real urban legend. That's just like that movie Candyman.
well, my story was real. - As real as your mother's new tits.
what's the first thing you'll do when you're mayor?
I haven't won yet. - But you will.
a lot can happen, so...
but so far...
what's going on in there? -- I don't know.
well, the first thing I'm gonna do is propose a 9 p.m. Curfew on all teenage girls.
I'll keep them off the streets, keep them safe.
keep them virgins.
I'm afraid that might be too late.
bloody Mary.
bloody Mary.
bloody Mary.
who is it?
David.
asshole.
so, David, you're back early. Shouldn't you be at the dance?
I'm sure it's still going on. -- Oh, yeah. Well...
I was there long enough not to see any of you.
we didn't want to go that stupid popularity contest.
and why is that? Oh, because you couldn't get dates?
Yep, that's exactly what happened. Football team put us on the blacklist.
we could've gone.
we just preferred to stay here and have some female bonding.
Hey, Mindy. Nice.
shut up. - David!
Oh, and just so you guys get it right...
...Candyman ripped off Bloody Mary in the first place.
not the other way around.
how long was your brother outside listening to us?
long enough to masturbate. - Not long at all, then.
David.
so how was it?
just like yours, I'm sure.
you didn't wake up naked in Tijuana.
just because there's a dead Mexican hooker in my room doesn't mean I went to Mexico.
Oh, Bill drank all my lemonade.
David, be nice. You know, and you could call him "Dad" once in a while.
never happen.
but I still call you "Mom."
mom, I need 100 bucks.
do me a favour. Go wake up the girls.
all right. Just because you own me, it doesn't mean I'm your slave.
go. -- Yeah.
they're already gone.
she's never done this before. I mean, this is so unusual for her.
I have to call Sheriff McKenna. -- Okay.
Yeah, Sheriff McKenna.
it's Bill Owens.
any word, anything?
we're doing all we can. You have to understand they're not officially missing for 24 hours.
Yeah, but they are missing. -- Hello.
that's it, nothing? All right, well, you just stay on top of this.
all right, look, when do we call in the FBI?
our hands are tied. We'll do all we can locally.
officially missing for 24 hours.
but they are missing.
right this way, sheriff.
sheriff. Thanks for coming. -- Hi, Bill.
I appreciate it. -- No problem.
the mountain gorilla.
an endangered species native to Central Africa. Mountain gorillas live in groups ruled by a dominant male which determines the group's daily activities and enforces a very strict social order.
the silverback.
do you think Samantha and her friends are okay?
Yeah.
and consume 20 times their weight in food annually.
I just spoke to Sheriff McKenna, and he's got all his men out searching.
they're gonna find her. -- Sure, that's easy for you to say.
she's just your stepdaughter.
What...?
Sam.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
they all say the same thing. They woke up in the basement of the abandoned old mill on the other side of the state park.
the door was locked. Well, that's what they said.
what do you mean?
well, we're gonna check it out. They don't remember anything.
other than that, they're fine. Weren't harmed or mistreated, nothing.
we ran blood tests and found traces of Rohypnol in their system.
it's a date-rape drug.
you don't have to worry about that. We ran medical tests.
they were not abused in that way.
so, what do you think?
well, it could be the girls' idea of a practical joke.
you know, for attention.
what happened?
what happened? What's wrong?
what's wrong? What happened to you?
my mom says that it's all a stunt. That they did it to themselves.
Samantha will write a story about it for the paper.
some people have no boundaries.
some people need to mind their own fucking business.
the girls are back.
they were in science class.
took them long enough.
you'd think twins would have some kind of sixth sense...
...like I'd know what happened to you.
we're fraternal, not identical.
how you holding up?
it was Buck and his friends, wasn't it?
he told us they just wanted to talk.
you are butt-white.
Hey, Roger. -- What?
you need to spend some more time at that tanning salon.
Hey, girls dig it, man.
he doesn't go to that salon to go tanning.
he goes to hook up with that chick.
the one with the big tits. -- Oh, yeah.
buck.
what's up? -- Come here. Come here, check it out.
what? Oh, yeah.
I know it was you. All of you. I know it was all of you.
what did your sister...?
we don't know what you're talking about.
we were at the dance all night. Ask our dates.
get out of here, loser. - You little punk.
Yeah. Get out of here. - Get out of here, man.
get lost. - You're not gonna get away with this.
whatever. -- Oh, I'm scared.
come on, get out of here. -- That's what I thought.
Bye-bye. -- See you.
we got a problem. -- This is not a problem at all.
those bitches, they won't say anything.
Yeah. Take Buck's advice.
what did you get on your SATs, Buck? Seven hundred?
total.
what's that supposed to mean?
you're such an asshole.
she needs to relax.
see you later, mama's boy.
shut up. Shut up.
no way. Shut up.
Yeah. Totally. Shut up.
she did not. No way.
Oh, my God. He's here. I gotta let you go.
Hi, Roger.
Hi, Betsy. I hope it's okay I just showed up.
don't worry about it. I'm, like, the only one here.
I just wanna catch some sun.
lay on the bed a little bit, get my groove on.
then maybe I could get some of your sunshine.
okay.
how long do you want it?
just leave it on low. I'm gonna relax for a bit.
I'll get out when I'm done.
I'll be ready.
totally. Like, yeah, I saw it.
he is so hot.
Yeah, totally. Most people go nude.
totally.
Yeah. Totally.
no. Totally.
Yeah.
totally.
shut up.
help! Betsy!
yes way. My past. I could be president.
what time is it?
Oh, shit. Roger!
Oh, shit.
Roger! Roger! Roger!
Amen. -- Amen.
peace be with you.
thank you, Father.
Samantha?
Samantha?
Hey. --Hey.
I brought you homework you might have missed when you were gone.
I saw how Buck was looking at David at the funeral.
Heather, you know that David had nothing to do with Roger's accident.
Yeah.
listen...
...I know that things have been difficult for us.
it was so much easier when we were kids.
God, Sam, we were so close. What happened to us?
it's funny you should say that.
Why?
because it sounds like it came from a TV movie, that's why.
look, what happened to you was just a little payback prank...
...and I had nothing to do with it.
the guys didn't mean to go so far...
...but they were pissed off you published that photo.
just a prank?
they drugged us, and who knows what they did to us after they locked us up. I sure as hell don't.
how hard was it to crawl out the window?
that's not the point, Heather.
look, Sam, there's more.
it's...
this has all happened before. - What do you mean?
we'll talk about it tomorrow.
make sure and do your history homework.
I'm sorry.
she brought me my homework.
she felt bad. She was cool about it.
damn it.
you sure you don't want a ride? -- No, I'm good. Thanks.
Heather!
Heather!
Heather!
Heather!
Heather!
Heather!
Heather!
Heather!
Oh, my God!
unit 14, we have a 174...
what's going on?
what happened?
Sam, what...? Sam, talk to me. What's going on?
ashes to ashes and dust to dust.
she was in bed. How could they be crawling out of her face?
I think it's really sick, though.
they were coming out of her face.
now, I'm sure you've all noticed the new security precautions on campus.
every effort is being made to keep our students safe.
now, Principal Rosetti has asked me to remind everyone...
Samantha, dear.
is something the matter?
no.
well, as I was saying students who need to speak to a counsellor should tell their advisor.
so how was school today, honey?
I saw a ghost in science class.
do you really think that he did it to himself?
Roger Dalton was dumb...
...but don't you think that he would wake up before he cooked his ass?
what are you saying?
I'm asking if you really think there's nothing more to our friends dying.
Heather dropped some acid and just ripped her face off like a mask?
of course not.
she didn't even drink, let alone do drugs.
there's something wrong in our little town, and it has a name.
Owens. - David?
both of them. They were there both times.
Jesus, Buck.
murder?
so, what are we gonna do?
your dad still have those emergency gas cans?
get them.
and meet me behind the park at midnight.
I don't know about this, Buck.
come on. Scaring the girls is one thing, but...
right.
okay.
I'll be there in 15.
holy shit, this guy's dick is smoking. Hey, McKenna better check your beer bottle tonight.
did you ever hear the story about a guy who was drinking a beer...
...and found a finger in the bottle? Look at this.
someone cut his ring finger off.
wild. -- Will you stop with that crap?
that finger is probably some coyote's lunch.
Yeah, we got EMTs on the scene.
Worthington High School classes have been cancelled today.
another student from that school was found dead.
although drunk and driving...
...Early reports suggest electrocution as the cause of death.
Tom Higgins, a varsity football player...
there's something else going on here.
Heather left this in my American history book the other night.
I think someone sent this to Heather as a warning.
this is the same thing that happened to you.
only I'm still alive.
here.
read the other one.
professor at Alpine University kills students using urban legends as M.O.
wait, you think there's a copycat killer that's killing our friends.
no, I just think that Heather was trying to tell me something.
I need your help to figure it out.
well, it's about time you asked.
Mary Banner lived here in Utah. She went to Worthington High.
it says the other two girls returned home unharmed.
they should still be alive. See if you can find it online.
are you smoking crack? This is dial-up. Let's use the school database.
school's closed today. -- I have keys to the newspaper office.
okay.
let's just get down there and finish this.
wait, wait, go back.
there.
the two girls, seniors at Worthington High refused to press charges against unknown assailants.
why no names?
got them. Gina Lotnick, 17, Mary Banner, 18, and Grace Taylor, 17.
where are they now?
Oh, that's from '82.
local resident Gina Lotnick died this morning of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
miss Lotnick was one of the victims in the homecoming kidnapping in 1969 of which there are no suspects.
Mary Banner, another victim, was never found and presumed dead.
who was the other girl? -- Grace Taylor.
the only remaining survivor of that fateful night is Grace Taylor.
Hey, got it. It's not that far from our house.
Hey.
Hey, Coach Jacoby.
what are you kids up to?
Oh, nothing. Just some extra credit, you know.
the school's closed.
and that goes for your newspaper.
you're gonna have to leave.
now. -- All right, cool. Thanks, coach.
Hey. - I just feel like I'm cracking up.
I know it's tough, but we shouldn't blame this on a bunch of ghost stories.
I don't know what to believe.
these just seem like awfully big coincidences.
they're odd, I'll give you that.
they're either accidents, or there's a killer out there.
there's no ghost.
but there is something.
I mean, there's something connecting this to what happened to me to those girls in '69.
we're gonna find out what it is.
grace Taylor is gonna tell us.
this is it? - Yeah, it's groovy.
come on.
power to the people. Free Angela Davis. What's up?
Hi, I'm Sam, and this is my brother, David.
so? -- So we wanted to talk to you.
miss Taylor, we wanted to talk to you about what happened at homecoming 35 years ago.
power to the people.
right on.
you take your shoes off.
have a seat, kiddies. You want some tea?
no, thank you. -- Penicillin?
Oh, yeah, we would love some tea.
so, what do you kiddies want to know about that night?
well, we were hoping you could tell us everything.
professor at Alpine University kills his own students using urban legends as his M.O..
there were five of them, including that devil bitch, Dawn.
Gina and I were tricked, drugged and left 20 miles from home in the woods...
...all because we didn't worship them like the rest.
everyone said that we just got wasted and passed out.
no one wanted to cop to the truth.
that happened to me too.
I know. I read it in the papers.
but you all came back in one piece. My best friend...
...Never came home.
get that.
it's Mary. -- What is?
the murders.
it's Mary Banner. Looks like urban legend, but it's Mary.
but she's dead, isn't she? -- Oh, she's dead, all right.
but her energy, her life force, is very strong.
always was.
you kids know that nothing ever dies, don't you?
it just changes form, you know, like water into ice into water into steam into water into ice, you dig?
wait, so you're saying a ghost is killing these kids.
but that doesn't make any sense. Why would she be killing us?
why not just go after the people who actually did this to her?
the children will always suffer the sins of their fathers.
your friend Heather had a devil-bitch mother by the name of Dawn.
well, Mary wants revenge on the five people who took her youth...
...so she's taking their children.
that's where she's starting. Who knows where she'll stop.
she has always had to have her way.
come on, you're not buying this, are you?
miss Taylor...
...we need to know the names of the boys who did this to you...
Oh, baby.
I can barely remember how to tie my shoes let alone the names of our dates.
but they were all on the football team.
this is ridiculous.
I cannot believe you believe her. - I can't believe you don't.
this is as bad as when you thought there was a vampire living under the porch. - I'm starting to wonder if I was right.
kidding.
Heather's mom went to Worthington, so we can assume she was involved along with Roger's and Tom's dads.
so we have to figure out who's next, probably Buck.
Sam, Mary Banner isn't killing people. She's dead.
it's more likely that Grace Taylor is doing this.
look at these.
did you steal these? -- Yeah, just look at them.
the handwriting is just like on the envelope that was sent to Heather.
grace sent the clippings to Heather.
this is how Heather died.
I saw the spiders, but no one believed me.
this one's a girl, but the same thing happened to Roger.
Oh, God.
they're all coming true.
Oh, God. We have to find Buck.
he won't be hard to find. Let's get out of here.
buck, we need to talk to you. -- What?
you gonna write about me in the newspaper?
no, I just think that... -- Come on.
I'm sorry that we played a stupid fucking joke on you and your friends.
but did Roger and Tom and Heather deserve to die for it?
do you honestly think I could kill someone over a stupid, asshole jock prank?
look, Buck...
...do you know about the kidnappings at Worthington High in 1969?
that was something that he did when he was young.
it's like a rite of passage.
wait, you're talking about your dad? -- Yeah.
my dad was pissed about the picture you put in the paper. And the article.
he told me about how he and his friends would have handled it.
so Coach Jacoby was one of the boys involved in the kidnappings? The Mary Banner case?
Yeah, but he didn't hurt her.
he didn't even know what happened to her.
she just disappeared.
she didn't die like Heather did.
buck, I'm sorry.
all right, come on, we gotta get out of here.
I'm worried about Buck.
well, he's a source of worry, I agree.
I think that Buck's dad killed Mary Banner. I think he's lying to Buck.
Oh, and I'm sure you got this info directly from Mary Banner.
well, I saw Coach Jacoby at her grave after Roger's funeral.
wait a minute.
you think Coach Jacoby had something to do with these murders?
no, I mean, not directly. I just think that...
what? You were gonna say something.
this might sound strange, but I think...
she thinks that the ghost of Mary Banner is killing people.
guys, if either of you have information, real information you better stop fooling around and tell me.
just lik e that. -- Oh, baby.
you're so nasty.
Yeah, that's it. -- Spank me.
that's it. Oh, yeah.
so good. -- You love it.
Oh, yeah.
so big. -- Come on.
right there. Right there. -- Yeah.
shit.
damn it.
under.
okay.
what the hell?
holy shit.
Oh, Jesus, Chewy, did you eat another skunk?
that's right. -- Oh, God.
don't stop. Don't stop.
come on. Right there.
you lik e it, huh?
Hey, don't look now, but Coach Jacoby's crying.
maybe something happened to Buck. - Maybe someone cut his kidneys out.
Hey. - Long time no see, Sam.
have you guys seen Buck?
have we seen Buck? -- Yeah, his dad looks really upset.
Yeah, well, Buck got himself good and killed last night.
Yeah, I heard he got crushed under a vending machine.
he tried to snag some free chips, and then smash.
did your mother drink while she was pregnant?
in the news, they said he got his throat cut by a prostitute in some sleazy motel.
wait. Buck's dead?
maybe you shouldn't be so concerned with his well-being.
he certainly wasn't concerned with ours.
four down. One to go.
are you still looking for clues?
God, you were fat.
did you know that Grandpa was bald?
guess you can kiss your hairline goodbye.
Yeah, and Grandma has a moustache.
I think Heather was trying to tell me something.
we know that her mom was one of the people involved in Mary Banner's disappearance.
why don't we ask Heather's mom who the other boys were.
Yeah, and then what?
and then we'll know who's left on Mary Banner's hit list.
Sam, I appreciate your community spirit...
...but most people in this town don't.
most people think... - I'm one bolt short of a nutcase.
that I should have been drowned at birth.
Yeah, in that general direction.
where are you going?
we need to talk to the police, but we need evidence.
I'm going back to see Grace.
Oh, that's smart, walk straight into the jaws of death.
I don't think she's the killer anymore. She's afraid to leave her house.
but I think she knows who the killer is.
okay, call me. - Yeah.
Hello?
grace...
...are you here?
shit! You scared me to death.
what are you doing in my house, X-Man? How did you get in?
the door was open. -- Oh, yeah.
for the cats.
you're lucky.
you almost got sprayed with bug spray. Hit.
what do you want? Spit it out.
I really need you to tell me the name of the football players who abducted you all those years ago.
please, Grace.
I wouldn't tell then, I won't tell now.
did anyone ever tell you that you look exactly like Foxy Brown?
that's smooth, brother.
very smooth.
you know...
...Anyone who wanted to could have found out who those boys were just by looking at the pictures in the school archive.
in the archives?
right on, Gracie. Thank you.
damn it.
Oh, my God!
Willy. Willy!
Willy!
don't leave me in here, Willy.
Willy!
Willy!
there's Grace.
Where's Mary?
Hello, Mary.
who's your date?
there he is.
holy shit.
no. No, stop.
leave me alone. No.
leave me alone!
grace.
grace, you need to get a phone that works.
grace, please.
please.
what does Mary want with me?
Mary's visited you too, huh?
find her.
find her and bury her.
but I saw her grave.
you saw a tombstone, baby girl. She's not buried there.
Gina and I looked for her for years.
nobody ever found her body.
she could be anywhere.
I think I know where she is.
I hope this is what you want.
Sam!
Samantha!
Hey, it's the Owens. Leave a message.
David, are you there?
David, if you're there, pick up the phone.
David.
I think I know where the body is.
I know... I know you think I'm crazy, but...
this is the one piece of evidence that we need to bring it to the cops.
when you get this message, meet me at the school, okay?
you have my k eys.
meet me at the side door.
I forgot to tell you.
your brother went over to the school.
great. He has my keys.
you're just gonna have to take me in your car.
no way.
I have not been back there since homecoming, 1969.
please. I would take my bike, but it'll take me too long.
no, I can't!
look at me.
grace.
damn.
you have to promise me that you will bury her when you find her.
David!
David, open the door!
David! - Shit.
David, open the door!
David?
I saw someone in there.
was it Mary? - I don't know.
maybe.
I'm gonna climb through the window.
I'll go around and open the door for you.
no, hey, I'm cool. I'll wait in the van.
Oh, damn.
shit.
grace, I got her.
grace, wake up.
shit. I found her, Grace.
grace, I really need your help.
grace. Shit.
damn, that's some chronic. Shit.
grace.
Oh, no.
Oh, Grace.
are you okay?
Oh, shit.
grace.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
Oh, fuck.
Hello? - Bill.
bill, thank God. -- Sam, where are you?
I'm at the cemetery. - Calm down... Sweetie.
your mother... Sam, what's going on? - What?
I can't hear you. You're in a what?
I can't hear you. - Where are you?
I'm at the cemetery.
fuck. Fucking cell phones.
bill.
thank God you're here. I really need your help.
all right, just calm down and tell me what's going on.
I found the body. Now I have to bury it.
Mary Banner's body.
I finally found it, and now she wants me to bury the corpse.
here, sweetheart, I got it.
this ground's frozen.
okay, I just don't want you to worry about this.
I'll take care of it.
everything will be fine.
did you hear that?
that might be Coach Jacoby.
don't worry about him. I can take care of him.
does anybody else know about this body?
no, just me and David.
did you say anything to your mom?
Samantha.
someone, help!
someone, help me!
did you tell your mom? - No.
help! - You leave her alone!
get out of here, baby! Go on!
Willy Owens.
you're gonna go down.
you wait until the city council hears about this.
Samantha!
come on, sweetheart, I don't want to hurt you. I just wanna talk.
Samantha!
I'm sorry I hit you.
I... I have a problem with anger management, but I'm okay now.
what's gonna happen to your mother if I go to jail?
because she won't have David anymore...
...because David is dead.
you're crazy!
what the...?
grace.
I...
far out.
no one is ever gonna believe us.
Samantha.
follow the tracks down the hill.
Hey, now.
I fall asleep again? -- Yep.
bill.
you mean "punk."
they're saying he died of a heart attack.
I guess something must have scared his butt real bad.
you gonna be okay?
I guess this will just be another ghost story.
something to talk about around campfires and slumber parties.
baby girl, you're the urban legend now.
a decades-old mystery was finally solved last night...
...when police discovered the body of mayoral candidate Bill Owens dead of a heart attack while apparently attempting to dispose of the remains of Mary Banner a local girl who disappeared over 30 years ago.
while police refuse to confirm it, a source tells us that it was Owens who was actually responsible for Banner's death on that fateful homecoming night in 1969.
it's time that we told him the truth
about who he really is. I think Tyler's ready.
but he's still not here on the ship with you. Get him.
Lisa. - I missed you.
I'm pregnant.
you need to tell her the truth before she finds out.
John May started the Fifth Column.
the first group of visitors to ever turn against the leadership.
Anna's birthing soldiers.
you need to stop 'em. The visitors took everything I had.
I don't want that to happen to you.
Georgie. - Long live The Fifth Column!
dad, I heard something outside, and I think I saw a U. F.O.
there's no such thing as U. F.O. s, buddy. Go back to bed.
but I... but I... but...
that's okay. Go on. I love you, James.
...with full respect for the freely expressed...
they're here for me.
tell the others I'm going dark.
Ah!
did you really think Anna wouldn't find out you turned against us?
how could you do this to your own kind, start a resistance?
these people are worth saving.
no. It's your human skin.
you've been wearing it too long.
you got confused. You're sick.
bliss is a sickness.
it's mind control.
human emotion... it's... it's not sickness. It's beautiful.
human emotion?
you betrayed us for human emotion?
Yeah.
you may as well kill me now because I will never stop hunting you.
one day you'll understand.
you can't escape, John May!
you can't escape!
can someone please lay out for me who the hell that guy is?
John May was the first V to turn against Anna.
he started the resistance.
I was with him just before he disappeared.
you knew him. Ryan, why didn't you say?
because no one needed to know until now.
look, the bottom line is we are not leaving Georgie up there to die.
the only reason he's on that ship is because he tried to save me. I gotta get back on the ship.
but how? It'll be impossible now.
we'll do it. We'll figure it out.
how much does he know... about who you are, where you are?
who your loved ones are? I'm not saying he'll talk cause he's a coward.
I'm saying, everyone has a breaking point.
everyone talks.
no, not Georgie. He'll hold on till we get him.
which as you compadre here just spelled out, is impossible.
we may not be able to get back on that ship, but there may be another way to save him. - How?
joshua, the one who helped me embed the "John May lives" message. He's Fifth Column.
said there's a way to contact them, some sort of comms device.
it's encrypted and the tech's outdated,
so the V's don't monitor for it anymore.
if we can get our hands on that...
we can coordinate a rescue plan with The Fifth Column aboard the ship. Good.
first sensible thing anyone's said, and it's the blonde.
Where's the device?
upstate. Town called Reedsville.
belonged to John May. But there's someone else.
his stepson.
he might be able to lead us to that device.
great. - Let's go.
the human managed to fight off the effects of the memory chamber.
we've been unable to retrieve any useful information about who helped him embed the message in our broadcast.
he won't give names.
impress upon him more strongly that he has no choice in the matter.
I've already sent for the human pain expert from the Tokyo ship.
your pregnancy...
you should be resting.
there's no time for that.
I need to make sure the "live aboard" program stays on track.
there are whispers of an anti-V terrorist group.
polls show people have grown apprehensive about coming to live on the ship, which will affect the success of our "live aboard" program.
get Chad Decker
I'll address the people directly.
I want those bodies on this ship.
uh, um...
Hi.
hello.
you are?
Lisa, Tyler's friend. Ah.
it's nice to meet you, Mr. Evans.
Hi. Um...
Tyler's mom didn't... mention anything about you coming.
did, uh, Tyler invite you?
actually no. I just thought I'd check in on him.
why does he need you to check in?
he didn't. I just thought he could use the support.
it's just, um, this situation's been a little hard, right?
I mean, since you left?
have you had breakfast yet?
um, oh, I'm sorry. Wait... wait a minute.
what did he say, exactly?
he hasn't said anything bad about you, Mr. Evans.
so you guys, uh, met.
huh.
don't worry, dad. I slept on the couch.
I swear. Um, Lisa showed up late last night, and... kind of surprised me.
huh. S-surprised me, too.
could you...
come here, please?
um, listen,
I know you wanted to spend some time with me, but is it... is it okay if she hangs with us?
dad...
I really like her.
of course.
Thanks.
this is Chad Decker for WNT, bringing you an exclusive interview with the V high commander Anna.
it's good to see you again.
thank you, Chad.
I know there have been rumors about the messages sent from our ships during my announcement last night.
Yes. "John May lives..."
can you tell us what that means?
I wish I could, Chad.
it appears it was merely a glitch in our system, an overlay of old code from our language training program used to learn the English language.
what's of greater interest to me are the things that are going right.
people are so excited about the "live aboard" program.
it will give us a chance, before we leave, to reciprocate the hospitality you have shown us.
later today, you will join me as sit down
with some of the invitees to answer their questions.
I can assure you, those joining us
will be treated with the utmost care and respect.
this is the last time we're going to ask.
what are the names of your co-conspirators?
Oh, you want names?
Evelyn, my wife.
there's a name.
we were 2 months shy of our 12th anniversary.
here's two more... Brian and Evan, my 2 boys, 6 and 8.
you freaks killed them, too.
our doctors will assure that you will receive the best medical attention we can provide.
I'm Dr. Maita.
let me explain to you how the scours operate.
it's a curious little creature.
it likes to explore every inch of the human body, from the inside.
its preference is to travel along the nerve lines.
the scour enters near the face...
and exits via the soft tissue, usually through the reproductive organs.
and remember, we are of peace, always.
after the John May message,
we anticipate resistance members will come out of hiding.
as sleeper agents embedded in key positions, you need to be ready.
each of you has one of these in your possession.
if you notice any suspicious activity...
an assistance will be deployed to your location.
dismissed.
stop.
please.
I'll give you the names you want.
pull over here. This is John May's place.
does he know his stepfather was a V?
no, May wanted to protect his family.
told them nothing.
just a second, guys.
Yeah. You know, you could have told me that the girlfriend was part of the package.
what are you talking about?
she's there? Lisa? - Yes.
she showed up last night.
I mean, what is the deal with her?
she seems to know all our dirty laundry.
she's a peace ambassador with Tyler.
Joe, I'm sorry. I can't get into this right now.
Erica, I'm having a real hard time with this.
all these years, he's been blaming himself,
thinking that he's the reason that we broke up, because he went off and crashed his bike.
I mean, he... he needs to know the truth.
move it. Godzilla's getting nervous.
can we please not do this right now? I have to go.
I will you call you the minute I get a chance, okay?
the lies catch up to people, Erica, sooner or later.
Tyler needs to know that I'm not his father.
you okay?
no.
I've never told anyone this.
when Tyler was 14, he wrecked his bike, ruptured his spleen.
Joe and I went in to donate blood, and...
there's supposed to be certain matchups in blood work between parents and their kids.
ours didn't line up.
I'm not following.
they told us that Joe wasn't Tyler's father.
the tests aren't 100% accurate, but...
doctors don't know everything.
Joe never believed me.
if you don't have trust in a relationship, you don't have anything. - What does Tyler know?
sometimes you have to lie to people to protect them.
am I talking to the FBI Agent or the mother?
Oh.
you're not supposed to be kicking yet, are you?
Hey, honey. Uh, sorry to bother you at work, but, um, I was wondering if you knew where you put Dr. Pearlman's card.
I felt the baby kicking.
give me a call if you get a sec, okay? Thank you.
James May? - Yeah.
I'm Ryan Nichols. I was a friend of your stepfather.
is it okay if we come in? We need to talk to you about him.
a friend of ours is in trouble. - James, who is it?
some people that want to talk to me.
well, honey, invite them in.
can I talk with you a few minutes in private?
it's urgent. Uh...
you know what? Why don't I go put on a pot of coffee?
I might be able to help.
Hey, your friend's here.
good to see you again.
it's been, what, a year now?
uh, we were just about to sit down and have dinner.
I haven't eaten yet. I'll join you.
James took red ribbon at the science fair today.
Oh, yeah? Salt volcano?
cartesian diver.
cartesian diver.
Mm-hmm. Good job, kiddo.
so how'd you two lose touch?
our priorities shifted.
and what are your plans while you're in town?
I just came with some old friends to catch up a little.
they're coming by later, in fact.
they're eager to see John.
my family's not familiar with the old gang.
not at all?
no. Don't really dwell on the past.
there's too much richness in the present.
our pals have already planned to see you, counting on it.
you know how they are.
they won't leave without at least saying "hello.
tell you what... why don't, uh, we meet them out instead?
no need to subject Lillie and James
to a house full of guests on a school night.
sure.
wouldn't want to inconvenience your family, now would we?
I'm not interested in talking about
what my stepdad thought, okay?
so if you're just here to, I don't know, find closure,
then I can tell you what I learned a long time ago...
you don't find any.
so what did your friends want to talk to James about?
a family matter.
his stepfather?
I'm not sure. Our buddy's pretty secretive.
you heard about the John May message that went out from the bottom of the V ships?
there's a lot of John Mays in the world.
your stepfather started the resistance against the V's before anybody even knew they were here.
we're part of that resistance now.
what resistance? I thought the V's were friendly.
you guys are insane.
so how did you guys meet?
at a restaurant.
he was one table over, and he sort of... Caught my eye.
that sounds romantic.
so why now? What do you want?
John May had a comms device he used to communicate with the resistance aboard the mother ship.
we need that device to contact an ally up there.
and, James, we're running out of time.
okay, maybe we could raise Mork and Kal-El on the kree omni-wave projector.
look, James, I know it's a lot to wrap your head around.
you think? - Where did your stepdad keep his things?
boxed up in a storage unit in town.
got tired of looking at his stuff everywhere.
look, man, I'm sure you and my stepdad were friends, and you clearly have your whole cult fantasy thing about how swell of a guy John May was, but you weren't the one he left when he killed himself.
that suicide note was fake.
have you lived here long? - No. I'm from L. A. so...
yeah? Did you go to school out there? - Mm-hmm. UCLA.
great football. You like football? - Oh, yeah.
I love the Trojans. - Me, too.
the only problem is, UCLA's team is the Bruins.
I meant the Bruins.
Oops.
Aah!
Aah!
a shame.
pretty girl like her...
Oh, God.
storage unit in town.
let's move.
are you with us?
James, are you with us?
Yeah. - Come on.
the name you gave us isn't real.
Alex Morgan isn't real.
yes... She was.
she was my unborn daughter.
he's stronger than we anticipated.
he resisted the scours.
you're going about this the wrong way.
he can lead us to The Fifth Column.
we have to dig deeper than scours.
how long had she been like that for? Why was she with me?
the V's planted her with you to watch and wait.
she wasn't human, mate,
so don't sweat it.
how well did you know my stepdad?
he meant a lot to me. - That's not an answer.
Yeah, been a lot of that today.
all right, let's slow down.
joshua said it was here somewhere? - No, he said it was in Reedsville.
he didn't say it was here.
I found it.
what if it doesn't work? - We pray...
that Georgie dies quickly.
Hey, come on.
Yeah, he's been hiding something all day. I don't trust this guy.
Yeah, that makes two of us. - Yeah?
just stop it. Stop it. This is about Georgie...
Georgie, who's up there right now.
we can't afford mistrust, guys. - Make no mistake, we will save him.
we can't lose our way every time we hit a roadblock. Get it together.
what the hell are you shooting at?
I don't know.
but we better get out of here bere it wakes up.
it's that thing from the warehouse raid.
it's a seeker.
where is it? - I saw something flying over there.
where the hell is it? - Does anybody see it?
don't move.
how the hell did they find us?
your girl with the Freddy Krueger claws...
did she give you something, like a-a promise ring, anything?
Yeah, yeah. Uh, uh...
she gave me the watch.
let's go.
go, go, go. Come on. Come on. Let's go.
have you prepared what I asked for?
Yes. It's ready when you are.
if we've learned anything, it's that emotion is weakness.
love is the greatest flaw of humans, and our best tool to break them.
he says he misses his family.
let's show him his family.
since we couldn't use your memories,
we've decided to show you someone else's.
here are the memories of the V who killed your family.
run. I'm right behind you.
get away from me! Don't! Get out of my house!
turn it off!
keep playing it until he tells us what we want to know.
turn it off!
careful. See?
pretty easy, right? - Yeah.
I'm thirsty. I'm gonna get some sodas. You want one?
uh, yeah. - Can I get you one?
please. - Sure.
listen, um, my dad wants me to stay a few weeks.
and I'll still see you.
believe me, I-I r-really wanna see you.
and I know it sucks, but maybe...
maybe this will help me and him fix some stuff.
what?
I overheard something,
but I-I don't think I should say anything.
what is it? Just tell me.
I can't. It's... it's not my place.
Lisa, please, just...
it's okay.
I think your father's been lying to you.
about what?
I don't think he's really your dad.
come on. That's...
that's ridiculous.
I overheard him talking to your mom.
sorry.
I know I shouldn't have said anything. - Hey, guys, here we go.
here you are.
Hey.
what is it? What's wrong?
there's a weird mix-up going on here. Um...
Lisa just said that she heard you talking to mom, and you said something about you not really being my dad.
I... I don't know. It's... It's crazy.
Oh, Ty.
it's true?
it can't be. I... This is me and...
and you.
it's, uh, it's complicated.
don't you look at her.
you lied. - Wait. Wait, wait, - What, is this why you left mom? - No.
Yeah.
I said I couldn't trust her, Ty.
what about me?
you left me, too, dad.
what, you feel duped for raising somebody else's kid?
no. I love you, Ty,
either way. Please trust that.
you need to go talk to your mom about this.
Yeah, I will.
when I applied to be a part of "live aboard
at the healing center, I never thought I'd get picked. And...
I never thought I'd get picked.
I've always thought of myself as having bad luck,
but this... Why'd you think you had bad luck?
when I was 15, I had an appendectomy,
and complications left me unable to have children.
I mean, I feel blessed for everything that I have.
but at family reunions, my siblings all have big families...
not a one under eight kids. - Everyone in your family?
Yes.
...Siblings all have big families...
not a one under eight kids.
not a one under eight kids. - Everyone in your family?
Yes. It's huge.
yes?
Joshua? Joshua, it's Ryan.
you found it. Good. - Yeah, hey, listen, we have a friend that's up there. His name is Georgie Sutton.
he went up there looking for me, and they caught him.
I haven't heard anything. - Yeah, well, he's up there, okay, - And I need you to find him, all right? - I will.
keep the comms device close.
is it true... what you said?
my stepdad faked that suicide note?
Yeah.
bastard.
Hey.
that man changed my life.
yeah?
good for you. He changed ours, too.
now listen to me, James.
your stepfather didn't abandon you.
he never would have left you and your mother if he wasn't forced to.
how the hell would you know?
because I'm the one that forced him to leave.
so what have you been doing this year? - Looking for you.
no, I mean, what have you experienced in your time here?
you never took a drive in the middle of the night just to feel the wind in your face?
or had a cold pint on a warm day?
saw a woman who literally took your breath away?
no, see, I think you've been touched,
living among people.
maybe not much, but there's a glimmer.
I can see it in your face.
you know, the humans...
they have an expression they use when they realize what truly matters to them.
they say they've found their "true north.
well, I've found mine here, Ryan,
with that woman and that boy.
what's that?
that's my suicide note.
take a good look at that family in there, Ryan.
you tell me, am I gonna need it?
they're expecting you, John.
it's too late.
ten years ago, when I came to your house for dinner...
that was the day that I killed John May.
you knew and you didn't say anything?
you knew that John May is dead? - No, not just dead.
dead at his hand.
every single day, I wish I could go back and undo what I did,
but I can't.
all I can say is your stepfather led the way.
I've taken risks that you can't even imagine,
because of what he taught me.
this fight...
will be brutal beyond anything you've ever seen.
and you, too.
and John May is our greatest weapon in it.
Anna ordered his death.
every single time she sees the message "John May lives,
it's like a dagger in her eye.
the Fifth Column exists because of him.
he existed because of you.
you and your mother... you taught him what it's like to be human.
he taught me.
so if nothing else, I just figured that you should know the truth.
no more lies.
Yeah.
I feel really stupid forgetting the combination.
no, it happens more than you'd think.
uh, Let's just see, the model number here.
the reset code is...
8-3-3-2-8 pound.
okay, well, I'll, uh,
I'll just see myself out then, huh?
you convinced a lot of people today to come live aboard your ships...
people like these two.
this woman comes from a family with unusually high fertility rates, but she's got a bad luck streak, can't have kids.
this guy... brilliant violin player, but a total mess.
I looked into our other guests from today's story.
same deal.
all so full of potential, but they're broken toys.
this type of person is of great interest to you.
the question is...
Why?
as sophisticated as humans are, you don't see the true value in people.
you discard them.
I see their inner worth.
EveryV, regardless of history or luck or circumstance, receives my care.
I'm only showing humans the same regard.
Yeah.
I'm not buying it.
I don't know exactly what all this means yet, but I'm pretty sure it adds up to something.
and if I can get this far in half a day, how far do you think I could get in a month?
what do you want?
I'll tell you what I don't want.
I don't want to be ordinary.
if you were ordinary, Mr. Decker, you wouldn't be here.
which is exactly why I'm gonna keep digging into this.
and eventually, I'll find enough to run this story.
or you can give me a bigger one.
I can protect you.
the question is, can we keep helping each other?
I think that we'll be helping each other for some time to come.
Yeah, I'm here. How's he doing?
he's alive, And he hasn't broken yet.
can you move him?
everyone's being watched too closely right now.
but the "live aboard" program commences in a few days.
I might be able to smuggle him onto an outbound shuttle.
will he last that long?
Yes.
they'll keep him at the edge of life.
is he conscious?
can he talk?
go ahead.
buddy, how you doing?
been better.
you're off the ship? You're safe, right?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm safe.
we're all safe. - Good.
we're gonna get you out of there, okay?
no.
that's what they're waiting for. That's what they want.
you come rescue me, you all get caught.
Georgie, listen to me, all right?
just give us a few days. Just hang on, all right?
I don't have a few more days, Ryan.
you know that.
let me speak to Jack. - Georgie, please.
I need to speak to Jack, Ryan.
we're not leaving you up there, Georgie.
it's bigger than me now, father.
no, Georgie.
listen to me, okay? Hang on.
I'll see you around, Jack.
are you sure?
I'm ready to see my family now.
God... Bless you, George Sutton.
God bless you.
make sure they don't track it back to you.
John May lives.
to Georgie...
not in vain.
Hey, this is Val, leave a message.
Hey, baby. It's me.
there's something I need to talk to you about when I get home.
I'm not who you think I am.
I just feel you should know the truth.
no more lies.
no more secrets.
I just feel you should know the truth.
I always wondered why he left.
deep down, maybe...
I even knew... It had to do with me.
it didn't, honey.
what did dad tell you?
I know everything, mom.
the tests are wrong.
the doctors were wrong. He is your dad.
I promise.
not according to him. - I know.
how could you not tell me?
because...
I was scared you wouldn't believe me, and,
Tyler, I thought if I just kept going, that somebody would tell me that it was a mistake, because it is. It's a mistake. I didn't. I never...
I thought that I could always trust you
baby, you can. Ty, you can. I was coming home to tell you.
why should I believe you? - Because it's true.
how can I believe you? - Please. Please, Tyler. Please.
it's not true.
it's not.
it's not true!
honey?
george Sutton died.
the emotional trauma must have been too intense for him.
we did not get any names.
John May lives..."
trite and untrue, but even still, the message The Fifth Column sent seems to have produced something of a groundswell.
let them have this one victory...
because I'm about to deliver them...
a thousand defeats.
we will not betray you. We are of peace, always.
I'm pleased the baby survived.
the mother, however, did not.
you killed her, didn't you?
Ryan Nichols has returned to earth.
what makes you think you can control him this time?
we have his child.
at some point, Ryan's gonna have to make a choice - His daughter or us.
joshua, do you remember anything?
I remember nothing.
Hello, mother.
15 years.
15 years and not a single glimpse of you, not since you put me down here.
I had no choice.
your human skin was infecting you with emotion, weakening you.
so you had to seize power from me before your time, tell everyone I was dead, bury me down here like a dirty little secret.
I did what I felt I had to do to protect our species.
I never imagined that it would take so long.
take so long for what?
for you to admit that you felt human emotion.
don't be ridiculous.
then why are you here?
scientific curiosity.
our top medical officers continue to work on isolating and eradicating human emotion.
to no avail.
you've lived in your human skin twice as long as I have.
you've been down here stewing in emotion all this time.
and you want to know what I've learned, don't you?
when the humans set off the first atomic bomb, it shone across the universe like a brilliant flare.
another potential home world for our species.
so I came here and moved secretly among these people, to see if interbreeding was possible.
but then I realized that it would never work here.
if you proceed with interbreeding.
you will have a generation of V's who listen to their emotions, follow their hearts, and refuse to bow to their queen.
I will have human emotion under control before interbreeding takes place.
my plan will still take hold.
Lisa's just entering her cycle of fertility.
so all rests on Lisa's shoulders?
you're infertile.
she is the only one able to lay eggs, but she cannot do it here on earth.
I will make it work here.
the next viable planet is too far away, isn't it?
it's earth or nothing.
Hey, Lisa.
Joshua's alive.
they managed to heal him before he died.
Oh, my god.
Anna has him.
has she gotten any names out of him?
not yet. He-he claims he doesn't remember anything about killing the soldier eggs.
he doesn't even remember being in fifth column.
I can't tell if it's an act to protect us or...
you have to find out what he remembers, our names, our-our faces- and...
I need you to find out from him if he remembers any experimentation done on pregnant women as long as 18, 20 years ago.
you were pregnant then.
Yeah.
what does that mean about you?
Tyler?
Hey, hon.
I missed you, so I came to see you.
nice look, Ty.
Yeah, I cut myself shaving.
well, you gotta stop using that bowie knife.
you wanna go? - Sure.
Bye. Have fun.
I need you to analyze this blood sample.
don't you people ever just say "hello"?
I'm sorry, Sid.
I am very glad that you're on board.
you are an excellent resource.
soldiers are studly. Scientists are resources.
I need to find out what they did to me, my son.
you said that if you had blood samples, you could figure out if they messed with Tyler in utero.
you have mine. Please take his.
are you sure you wanna go down this path?
if it were your kid, what would you do?
thank you.
there is no greater loss than a parent losing a child.
let the grace of god fall on Valerie Stevens... Her beloved parents, and her unborn baby.
Mr. and Mrs. Stevens - You did this to her. You did it.
she had a heart condition.
she should never have gotten pregnant.
she should never have had to go to the v's and their healing centers.
I thought with their technology that that would be best.
look at you.
you're not even crying.
don't you have a heart?
don't you have a soul?
I'm sorry for your loss. - Go! Just go.
Anna wanted you to have this...
to see your daughter.
with Anna revealing red sky to be a gift to humans, by and large, the visitors are once again being embraced the world over.
healing centers reopen this morning from Delhi to Nairobi.
and as this line of participants in Manhattan attest, people are once again eager to take advantage of all that Anna and the visitors have to answer.
you're watching WNT. I'm Chad Decker. We'll be right back.
a moment, Mr. Decker?
I'd like you to meet Eileen Rounick. - Hello.
she will be the first mother to have her baby delivered entirely with V technology.
I thought you might like to interview her to underscore the good works we hope to continue here on earth.
happy to.
it's nice to meet you, Eileen.
it's pretty cool to see you in person.
I mean, I watch you all the time.
30 seconds, Chad.
so this is incredibly brave of you.
brave?
Yeah. I've-I've interviewed a few moms-to-be about having their babies born in there, and-and no matter how good the technology is, they're still new to this, to-to human childbirth.
so if something goes wrong... Well, these moms just didn't wanna risk their babies being the first, you know?
Really? - Chad, we're just about ready.
Yeah. Here you go.
all right.
I mean, you know some moms.
there's just no talking to them when their kid's safety's at stake.
Yeah.
forgive me, father, for I have sinned.
I remember you, my son.
you stopped coming to services.
did you lose your faith?
Yes.
with the V's here, I didn't know what to think, like so many others.
and the red sky came... And I wanted answers.
and then I... Heard your sermons again, father, on the internet.
and I found the answers I was seeking.
I'm pleased my words had an impact on you.
you said that it was a war for our souls, us versus the V's.
I want to be sure, father, that this is the right thing to do.
I believe in my heart that the answer is yes.
it's time to fight.
then that gives me great peace.
look! He's got a bomb!
at 3: 00 Greenwich Mean Time, suicide bombers hit healing and peace ambassador centers on six continents.
an international terrorist network.
hundreds of dead worldwide, 17 here, including the bomber, who's an unknown male.
we managed to pull this off a surveillance camera.
resolution's for crap, but at least it gives us an area code.
and the body?
well, head and limbs are pretty much blown off, but we recovered half the torso.
Oh, lucky day.
they're attacking humans.
it doesn't really fit the fifth column m.o.
they're anti-V, not antihuman.
well, the e-mail they sent claiming credit for the explosion features a nice little doctrine outlining their aims.
they think red sky was the first volley in a battle against humanity, and they're willing to do anything to throw a wrench in the visitors' plans.
well, what plans?
Oh, eat our brains, kidnap our young.
who the hell knows what kind of fantasies these whack jobs dream up?
one thing that's clear - All they really care about is blowing a hole in Anna's agenda.
29 holes.
the end justifies the means.
clearly, fifth column's not concerned with collateral damage.
looks like the timer reset.
pull out every stop.
find out who lit this fuse.
thank you, agent Malik.
the Queen will be pleased.
the fifth column's coordinated suicide bombings at peace ambassador centers across the globe have left authorities in 29 cities...
agent Malik delivered this from the crime scene.
once we run the reconstruction, we should be able to lift a print and point her quickly towards the bomber's allies, ahead of the FBI.
I want them caught and brought to me.
as they will be.
this tactical escalation is troubling.
fifth column is growing more aggressive.
29 bombings, Marcus - Once in each of our cities.
we've never been attacked on this scale.
it's an international spectacle.
fifth column is proving to be a bigger threat than anticipated.
we have just the weapon to fight them-Ryan Nichols.
one V.
the same V I sent to kill John May so many years ago.
when it came to pursuing fifth column, there was no one like Ryan.
until he turned against us.
he turned once. He can be turned again.
he resisted your bliss.
what makes you think you can control him?
because I have something more powerful than bliss.
why are you putting skin on the baby?
to prey on Ryan's loss.
every time he looks at this child, he will think of Valerie.
I believe it's hungry.
she wants her mother.
she has me.
there's no greater bond than a nurturing mother and her child.
I can use this bond with her to help control him.
beautiful, isn't she? She even has her mother's eyes.
what the hell are you doing?
why'd you put skin on her?
I did it for you, Ryan.
don't you wanna be with your baby someday?
maybe even have her with you on earth?
now with the skin, it's possible.
if I do what?
all you have to do is help protect your own kind.
then you get everything you want.
don't you want to hold your daughter, Ryan?
when the timer goes down to zero, another one goes off.
in all 29 cities?
no. The timer was set for each city, but new york is the only one that reset.
we have to stop these people.
stop them? We need to recruit them.
you condone this?
there's no arguing it was effective.
they wreaked havoc on Anna's plans.
now by killing a few humans, they could save millions.
that's pretty good bang for the buck.
we are talking about lives, Hobbes.
not to mention, this brought down serious heat on fifth column all around the world, including us.
us?
we're what, we're-we're four people.
we need an army, and these guys have one.
he's right. It's all over the news.
they're well-equipped, they're organized, they're on to the red sky, too, which means we gotta find out their sources, what they know.
now we may not like their tactics, but they're a weapon.
so the question is do you want that weapon in Anna's hands or in ours?
they're willing to kill humans to save humans.
that's crazy.
we can't win an all-out war against the V's, not until we're ready.
you know this.
I am not saying they didn't cross the line, okay?
they did.
but if we could get to them, talk them into approaching this war our way...
they have a global network.
isn't that what we want?
what we've been after?
in the meantime, I'm not letting them kill any more people.
fair enough.
what do you got on the bomber?
just this.
he's a librarian - Will Maybree.
I took his confession this morning.
he said... He said I inspired him.
I didn't understand.
I- I didn't-I didn't...
no. I never thought he would- was planning on killing
of course not. Of course you didn't. We-we know that.
you can help here, Jack.
we need to get his address.
somewhere in Hell's Kitchen. It'd be in the parish records.
okay.
hobbes and I will head towards midtown.
Ryan, go with jack.
get the address asap.The FBI has that photo.
they're circulating it as we speak.
we have a window, but it is shrinking fast.
after this morning's attacks, we've increased our efforts at identifying fifth column.
I've put Joshua in the memory chamber to see if he remembers his fellow traitors.
has there been any progress?
you seem concerned, Lisa.
of course I am, mother.
I want to make sure we find the traitors before they can do anything else.
start with his last memories and work backward - His final act.
if anyone helped him destroy my eggs, their face should appear.
the last thing he remembers is his takedown at the hands of Erica Evans.
it seems the near-death experience wiped out all other recent memory, included his recollections of fifth column.
the last thing Joshua remembers is that he's a devoted V.
is the memory loss permanent?
no. There's a lot of damage, but there are memory fragments.
eventually, I'll be able to reconstruct them.
uncover who he was working with.
I want those names.
I wanna know who else betrayed me.
you found will Maybree's address?
Yeah. I just sent it to Erica and Hobbes.
look, I have to, uh, to get to the healing center.
there's a vigil at the site of the bombing.
you okay, Jack?
I was gonna ask you the same thing.
you know that bombing wasn't your fault.
how could it have been your fault?
the humans, they - they love guilt, don't they?
they blame themselves, blame other people.
when things go wrong, they just wallow in emotion.
and you'd rather... - Act, yeah. Fight.
just... Just do something.
look, Ryan, I know that... Val's funeral was this morning, and I get that anger is easier than grief.
so you can get all pissed off at what we're dealing with and go after them.
we can do that, and we will.
but you can't carry all this into that fight.
yeah? How come I can't?
because if you shut it out, you'll lose sight of what you're really fighting for.
there's gotta be a clue here somewhere to what the bomber was doing.
not your average librarian.
toggle initiator.
the backup.
and this, 3 mm, static-resistant, high-impedance wire.
signature of our Israeli friends. - Mossad.
Yeah, clearly, your librarian didn't make this bomb.
we find our Israeli, we find our fifth column radicals.
something was tacked up here. Look at the holes.
like this.
okay.
targets.
the healing center and... the apex building?
every other bomb went off at a healing or peace ambassador center.
what is so special about this building?
Yeah.
what are you doing?
I'm calling it in. Thousands of people work there.
we know the target.
all we have to do is position ourselves there, intercept these guys, and make contact.
if you make that call, a swarm of feebs will scare 'em off.
we'll lose our shot at this crew.
it is too risky.
we make one mistake, thousands of people die.
we will find another way to track them down.
just like a woman, eh?
why save time when you can take the scenic route?
I want allies as much as you do, but that is a building full of innocents.
now get your hand off my wrist.
in times of danger, times of grief... of loss, we can turn only to our essential humanity.
for what are we if we let go of that, if we lose sight of the part of us that differentiates us?
we must be comforted by the light of god inside each of our souls.
let's bow our heads in silence.
I always knew humans could be manipulated by their emotions.
but it's also what gives them power, isn't it?
no more games, mother.
you'll tell me everything you know about human emotion and how to defeat it.
you really wanna play games, mother?
cause there's plenty more immolation pills where that came from.
all right.
I'll tell you.
but first, there's something I want.
keep moving, please.
move. We need you you exit the building.
we got bomb squads sweeping every floor, but it'll take at least 20 minutes to finish the evacuation and another hour to clear the building for explosives.
no, I don't have enough time for that.
we need to find the target within the target.
do you have a list of tenants? - Just got it.
...taking drastic precautions.
these include heightened states of security, body scanning, and bomb-sniffing dogs.
but will these additional security measures be...
WNT. 12th floor?
already been cleared.
they're working top down.
he's Anna's mouthpiece.
he survived the first explosion.
he's the reason that the timer was reset.
Chad Decker is the target.
sure.
why don't you guys go set up inside?
I'll be right there.
okay.
Chad! Down!
get her hand.
don't move!
as you requested, mother.
I first heard this music on earth.
no, I didn't hear it.
I felt it.
I carried it around in my head.
for 15 years, it was my only companion.
tell me the key to human emotion.
you're listening to it, daughter.
heartache, pain, sorrow.
I felt it all.
and still, where it strikes me... It's even deeper.
don't just listen.
hear.
within it, such beauty.
and yet it is called "sadness of soul."
is that what I'm looking for?
what makes humans human?
the soul? ?
you said at the vigil that we need to turn to our essential humanity, to the light in our souls.
now I have human skin.
I feel.
but I need you to tell me something.
do I have a soul?
every creature can feel the grace of god.
I don't.
you're not letting yourself.
my words have done so much damage today. Let me do some good. Let me help you more.
how can I find comfort if I don't have a soul?
Ryan, you do have a soul.
how do you know that?
because you wouldn't feel this way if you didn't.
the soul is what lies beneath.
it is the core of all humans.
it is the wellspring of emotion.
I always dismissed it as fantasy.
it can't be looked at solely with a scientific mind.
it's too complex.
nothing is too complex for our technology.
I will isolate it in the medical bay.
not in a lab.
not there.
it's here.
where is it, then?
the soul's not a thing, Ryan.
it can't be found.
it can't be put in a test tube or a body.
and it can never be destroyed.
the soul is the single greatest threat to our species.
if it's there, I'll find it, and I'll destroy it.
why is the bomb reconstruction from this morning's attack taking so long?
it's done, but it was useless.
it yielded no prints.
but I found something of value - a fabric thread stuck in the bomb fragment.
and you sourced it.
to a fabric produced at a particular factory in Singapore.
nine U.S. importers bought this in the past year, but only one operates on the east coast.
five Brothers Textiles.
five brothers.
a code for fifth column. Who is behind this company?
Eli Cohn, Israeli descent, former Mossad agent.
he owns many small businesses, cleverly hidden within shell corporations all over the world.
contact agent Malik.
make sure she finds Mr. Cohn before the FBI does and that she brings him directly to us.
first, we get a librarian. Now we got a secretary.
from Flushing.
let's break her.
you know, we don't need three of us in there.
why don't I peel out, look into singer's background?
go.
after you, Evans.
did you ever wish you could go back in time, take things back?
rewind, rethink things?
I had to take action against the V's.
you don't understand what they're up to.
edify us.
stopping me is not gonna solve anything.
at dawn, that timer resets.
not if you tell us what we need to know... now.
if you think I'm gonna tell you anything, you're underestimating me.
Melanie, a lot of people are scared of the visitors.
but if you don't help us, your fifth column friends are in serious danger.
the FBI is on edge.
there are a lot of itchy trigger fingers.
now, I am the point man on this for the moment.
and if you talk to us right now, I can get to your friends first...
maybe avoid a bloodbath.
we need answers, Melanie.
please help us. I never met anyone.
it was all done through chat rooms and stuff.
when I was ready, they came to pick me up in a van, blindfolded me, brought me somewhere to give me the explosives.
do you remember anything about the trip?
um... the route?
uh, sounds? Anything?
I heard a lot of trucks.
I think a barge whistle.
wherever it was, it may have been by the water.
get on it. - Yeah.
I'll take her from here.
about bloody time.
I called my hook.
I've got a list of possible ex-Mossad with last-knowns in Manhattan.
two dozen names.
I was waiting for your FBI brain to help me narrow it down.
anything by the water?
right, there's one of them.
Eli Cohn, owns a textile company right on the Hudson.
I'll meet you there.
we're a step ahead.
okay. Whose blood is that?
your partner's. - Malik?
Yeah.
did she see me?
I don't know.
okay.
we gotta split. - Yeah.
Ryan continues to resist me.
you underestimated his resolve.
no. He underestimated mine.
make it sick.
give it a chronic pain that only my bliss can alleviate.
no parent can stand by and watch while their child suffers.
if he wants to be human, I'll make sure he suffers like a human.
Ryan... Feel my warmth, Ryan.
Ryan, what's wrong?
feel my comfort.
no. No. - It's okay.
your baby is in terrible pain.
I can ease her suffering, as I can ease yours.
let me in, Ryan.
I can't. - Let me fill your emptiness.
I can't do this. No, I can't do this!
it's okay, Ryan.
the more I feel, the more Anna can hurt me.
just pray with me.
the soul-it is a blessing.
no. No, it's also a curse.
I can't-no.
Evans. Glad you're here. Follow me.
you're not gonna believe this.
Hey, sorry.
I was across town.
right through here.
quite the fashion statement.
blank passports.
high-quality work.
china, New Zealand, Russia.
29 cities and now this.
so how widespread is this thing?
they've got the models, the components, the paper operation.
they're shipping people internationally.
this was ground zero.
yeah? - What was missing?
what?
at Maybree's place? What was missing?
uh, I don't know. This is not a good time.
a car.
I found that registration renewal, but the garage was empty.
he drove to the healing center.
he left his car on a side street.
I checked out the last destinations on his nav system.
all pretty normal-looking stuff.
except... It saved the route to a place in Ossining.
text it to me. I'll meet you there.
you got it.
that was Tyler.
he's really freaked out with the bombing.
I need to go home.
C.S.U.'s processing the scene.
I'll call you if anything comes up.
okay.
I found this shipping label in the back, to a farm in Ossining, of all places. Could be something.
okay. I'll check it out.
lik, go with her.
I want both of you to check it out.
great.
forgive me, father, for I have sinned.
I failed to comfort a friend in need.
and I used my words, the words of god, to inspire violence.
the blood of innocents is on my hands.
I need to know - Where do I go from here?
show me a sign.
I thought I was a member of the fifth column now, not a target.
I was almost killed today.
sources say the first bomber worshipped here.
I'm a priest, Chad. I gave a sermon.
I never intended for anyone to take it that far.
Yeah, well, we don't always know the impact we're gonna have, do we?
I think that FBI agent, Erica Evans, is in danger.
I'm not sure who you're talking about.
I saw her here, with you.
she's in danger.
Evans' partner.
last time I checked, turning over stolen evidence to the V's is outside agency regs.
warn her... Or there'll be more blood on your hands.
so that was Tyler who called before, huh?
Yeah.
with everything that's been going on, he's been really concerned about my safety.
it is a dangerous job.
what were you doing across town?
sorry? - You told Kendrick you were across town before the warehouse.
right. I was...
checking Melanie Singer's apartment for clues.
well, good. What did you find?
nothing worth reporting.
you know, a cop said that he saw someone looking a lot like you driving away from the warehouse just before he arrived.
must have been mistaken.
pull over. Now!
calm down. - What the hell are you doing?
calm down. - Pull over, evans.
you're out of options here.
let me see her.
as a hybrid, she contracted an unforeseen disease that even our doctors have no answers for.
she's sick, Ryan.
she's in terrible pain.
I can see you're suffering, too.
I know you think you've changed.
but let me tell you, you have no soul, Ryan.
you will never have a soul.
but you can have something better.
you can receive my bliss, as can your daughter.
I can ease her suffering.
I can ease your suffering.
what do you want me to do?
all you have to do is join us again.
you were one of us.
let me help you, Ryan.
let me help your daughter.
just don't let her suffer.
I'll do what you want me to do.
get it out of here.
joshua, I've reviewed your research into human emotion at length.
after you turned fifth column, it appears you sabotaged your results.
I will begin anew immediately, my Queen.
what if I told you there was a source for human emotion - A repository?
the soul.
then I will devote myself to rooting it out, so you can destroy it.
my chief medical officer knows what to look for now.
I will succeed where you failed.
I wouldn't be so sure, daughter.
after all, you're running out of time.
soon enough, you'll lose control.
and I promise you this
one day, you'll feel the sting of your daughter's betrayal, as I have felt yours.
Maman!
Cecile, darling.
Cecile, do you remember Madame de Merteuil?
why, yes, of course.
what a beautiful young lady.
the last time I saw you, you were just a little girl.
Madame, is it true that I'm getting married?
who told you that?
everybody's been talking about it.
I'm not supposed to say anything...
...but yes, it's true.
to whom? - I can't say.
please, Madame, please. - I mean, I don't know.
your mother's been so secretive about it.
but can you try and find out, please?
it's really sweet to see Cecile so excited about her marriage.
Yes, she's excited, very excited.
lt almost has me worried. - Why?
she's been at that convent since she was 11.
she's so innocent, so unprepared.
as long as her husband doesn't mind.
on the contrary. He seems obsessed by her purity, virginity.
who is he?
it was he who suggested that she stay at the convent till the wedding.
that's very thoughtful. I like this in a man.
who is he?
I'd rather not say.
I agreed to let him make the announcement.
I see.
my dear, I'd love you to spend some time with Cecile.
she could learn so much from you.
I want her to enter this marriage as innocent as she is...
...and as wise as you are.
you flatter me.
Cecile.
do you see how I hold my fan?
Yes.
Vicomte. - Madame.
Mademoiselle.
won't you introduce me to your enchanting friend?
Cecile, if you allow your hand to be held too long...
...men will take it as an encouragement.
is this your first opera, mademoiselle?
should I answer?
if you do answer...
...a man will take it as an invitation.
if you don't, a gentleman will know he should leave.
so what should I do?
what do you want to do?
Yes, this is my first opera.
I've never been to one before. - Do you do any singing yourself?
Monsieur de Valmont, may I have a word with you, please?
that young lady is the daughter of my cousin...
...Madame de Volanges.
she's about to get married, and she's under my protection.
so you keep away from her.
how old did you say she was?
fifteen, you monster.
I just wanted to let you know that I'm going to leave Paris for a while.
where are you going?
do you really want to know?
if you want to tell me.
I'm going to visit my old aunt.
your old aunt.
my old aunt, yes.
how old is your old aunt?
you know her, Madame de Rosemonde.
Madame de Rosemonde is still alive?
so if you get bored with playing chaperon, you'll know where to find me.
and if you come, I'll be very happy.
very happy.
give my love to Madame de Rosemonde.
who was that?
Cecile, that man is very bad for a young lady's reputation.
your mother shouldn't even know he was in our box.
is he your lover?
Cecile...
one doesn't ask questions like that.
certainly not of a widow.
widows don't have lovers?
no, they don't.
more.
more?
I want more.
then...
...you might have to find yourself another lover.
no.
I'm very happy with the one I have.
you're not bored yet?
unspeakably bored.
when shall I see you again?
Monday?
Monday. I can't.
Tuesday? - Tuesday...
I'm afraid not.
Wednesday?
I'll have to let you know.
are you seeing somebody else?
of course not.
good afternoon, Madame.
no, it's A in the right hand, not B-flat.
Madame! - No. Don't stop.
this is...
I'm sorry.
Chevalier de Danceny. - Yes, Danceny.
he's giving me my music lessons.
nervous? - Madame, feel my heart.
don't be silly. Everyone will love your singing.
that's not it.
it's my husband, my fiance.
I know he's going to be there. I know my mother's invited him.
can you try and find out who he is?
please?
my dear.
Cecile is so nervous. Poor thing.
she believes that her fiance is here today. Is he?
see? How does she know that? She's so clever.
I never told her anything. - Which one is he?
you'll keep it to yourself? - Of course.
come. I'll introduce you, but...
why is he so secretive?
I think he has a mistress, and he's having trouble getting rid of her.
I heard she's a little...
I understand.
Monsieur de Gercourt, may I introduce you to Madame de Merteuil?
you two know one another?
do we?
if you remember that we do, madame...
...then your memory must be better than mine.
then I suppose that we don't.
you couldn't have made a better choice, my dear.
a knight riding through the glade chanced on a pretty maid. And as the sunlight played he wooed the pretty lady, "Sir, go thy way," the maiden replied, "My lord came today to make me his bride. There are others, other roses. Leave me to my lord and go."
now, he did not believe it true "Swore he would win the maid. But her lord came and slew both knight and pretty lady. Friends, though your rose be so fair..."
she's so adorable.
I can't even feel jealous.
I wish you all the happiness in the world.
thank you.
lovely.
is she...
just resting, sir. Just resting.
shall l... - No.
let's take it out.
is it my turn?
do you remember me?
of course I remember you.
just jog my memory a little. -I'm Madame de Merteuil.
of course you are, my dear.
I just arrived. - I know you've just arrived.
where is my table?
where is everybody?
sir.
there she is.
give me a push.
may I invite you for a ride?
no, you may not.
why not? -I can't swim.
neither can l.
no. My husband, he would never forgive me if I drowned.
where is your husband, madame? - He's in Rouen.
you live in Rouen? -No. We live in Paris.
my husband is a judge and he has an important case in Rouen.
do you love your husband, madame?
Yes, I love him very much.
so why aren't you with him? - Because I'm visiting your aunt.
besides, when my husband works on important cases he prefers to be alone.
does he often work on important cases? - Yes, quite often.
then you must be an exceptional woman. - No, it's...
not exceptional. Why? - To love a husband who's never there.
are you married, Monsieur de Valmont? - No.
I'm in love.
you're in love. - Yes.
then why aren't you with her? - I am with her.
I'm talking to her right now.
you shouldn't have said that. - Why not? Is it wrong to be in love?
no, as long as the feeling's mutual and legitimate.
does that mean you don't love me?
of course I don't love you.
don't do that!
Monsieur de Valmont!
Monsieur de Valmont, please!
don't do that. You frightened me.
what does it matter if I drown? You don't love me.
look, sometimes my friends tell me I'm naive, but...
I'm not so silly that I don't see what you want.
yes? What do I want?
if you don't stop talking that way, we can't be friends.
all I want is to be near you...
...and to hear you telling me over and over again that you don't love me at all.
no.
no, I'm not clever enough to talk to you.
help!
help me!
help me!
help! Help!
Vicomte.
what happened?
an accident.
so you did come.
thank you, Azolan. I won't be needing you.
Yes, he will.
prepare his traveling clothes and pack the rest.
we're going to Paris. - Wait.
wait.
Why? - I need you in Paris......very much.
you may go.
what is it?
you remember my little cousin from the opera?
Yes.
you remember she's getting married? - Yes.
guess to whom.
how could I guess?
Monsieur de Gercourt.
where do I fit in?
you're the only one who can help me.
do you want me to challenge him to a duel?
vicomte, for what I have in mind...
...I need you very much alive.
you know, little Cecile...
she reminds me so much of myself when I was 15.
she's naive, innocent...
she's naive, innocent...
...pure.
yes?
I want you to put an end to it.
I want you to take her virginity.
I want Gercourt to discover on his wedding night...
...that he didn't get there first.
I want to make him the laughingstock of Paris.
you want me to seduce a little girl...
...who's seen nothing...
...who knows nothing...
...who'll probably flop on her back out of simple curiosity?
you don't need me for that. Anyone can do that.
but I thought you liked her. I thought I was doing you a favor.
besides, I can't go to Paris now.
Why? - The air here is so fresh.
and you hear the birds singing. You never hear the birds in Paris.
who is she?
may I change the subject, madame?
change anything you want, my dear.
do you love your husband?
Yes.
Yes, I love him very much.
then why are you here?
why aren't you with him?
I'm afraid the Marquise and I share the same banal curiosity.
seems that Madame de Tourvel's husband prefers to be alone when he works.
men always say they prefer to be alone, but I love my husband.
so, I go where he goes.
out of love? - Why else?
fear, maybe?
fear? Of what?
that you might be tempted. - You mean, I might be tempted.
shush, my love.
are you hinting that I could be unfaithful to my husband?
not now, but, if you were alone...
Monsieur de Valmont, you simply don't understand women.
you're right.
if a woman wants a little adventure, she doesn't need to be alone.
she can manage it perfectly well right under her husband's nose.
isn't that true, madame?
that's not at all what I meant, madame.
Monsieur de Valmont, I know some women might be weak...
...but...
...believe me, there are women who will always be true.
nonsense!
a true woman is a contradiction in terms.
not always.
I believe that some women stay true.
I find them fascinating.
men usually do.
I've noticed that.
why is that?
because men are always chasing after visions, my dear.
they want us to be angels.
but in bed, they want us to be demons, my dear.
Yes, indeed.
but there always comes that morning surprise......when you wake up in the arms of an ordinary woman.
do you agree, Vicomte?
I believed that for a long time.
and you don't anymore? - No.
it seems to me, Vicomte, that you believe one thing in Paris...
...and another in the country.
maybe I believe one thing when I'm in love and another when I'm not in love.
there's something I've been wondering about all evening.
if you had your choice of all the ladies present...
...in whose arms would you spend the night?
no. That's not fair to Monsieur de Valmont.
the question is...
...which one of you ladies would like to spend the night with him?
we all would?
not me.
not me.
I don't think the question is worth answering.
I suppose that just leaves me.
good night. - Good night.
Valmont...
you disappoint me.
that's what's keeping you here? Tell me.
are you really falling in love?
would that make you jealous?
not really.
why not? - Because you're wasting your time.
I don't think so. - You'll never have her.
what do you want to wager?
anything you want.
you.
your body.
and if you lose?
anything you want.
I want you to...
...Shut yourself in a monastery, anoint yourself with ashes...
...and repent for all your sins.
I accept.
good night, my little monk.
I'm afraid you'll be very lonely.
remember me in your prayers sometime.
you know, I keep thinking about one thing you said at dinner.
I said so many things.
it had to do with your husband's nose.
and I thought you weren't interested.
where have you been? I've been looking for you desperately.
Why? What happened? - It's horrible.
it's Cecile. - What?
come.
did I show you the cabinet I gave Cecile?
it's an exquisite piece.
I told her, "You can lock all your secrets in there."
do you know what she said?
maman, you know it will never be locked.
isn't that the sweetest thing a daughter can say to a mother?
Yes.
it's locked.
I have a duplicate key, of course. - Of course.
so I looked inside.
do you know what I found?
letters. Love letters.
from... - From her miserable music teacher.
that little boy? - That little snake!
what did you do?
I didn't do anything.
Cecile doesn't even know I've read the letters.
I don't want her to know I have a key.
does her fiance know about this? - Of course not.
why don't I talk to her and see what I can find out?
yes?
Cecile.
Madame! Where have you been? I've missed you.
how beautiful you look!
thank you.
we must go to the opera again sometime.
I'd love to. It was so wonderful to see all that.
and those chandeliers and the music.
you should ask your music teacher to teach you some songs from the opera.
I'll do that.
you happy with your music teacher?
he's a wonderful teacher, and...
yes?
I can't tell you.
Cecile...
...if we're to be friends...
...we must trust each other completely.
he's been writing me letters.
has he?
he writes so beautifully, madame.
what does he say?
I don't know, really.
he has all these feelings.
he's sad.
he has longings.
do you love him, Cecile?
no, I don't.
so, should I answer him?
if you don't love him...
...it would be very wrong to encourage him.
but, madame, I lied.
I lied to you. I do love him. I'm so in love.
I don't want to marry my husband, madame.
he's old, and he's ugly.
I love Danceny.
please, madame, help me. I don't know what to do.
let's write Danceny a letter.
I've already written him one.
may I see it?
you're not telling him what you want to tell him, Cecile.
get your pen.
what do you call him? -Chevalier.
dear Chevalier...
your love gives me the courage to follow my heart.
I long to meet you somewhere...
...where we can finally be alone.
our biggest obstacle is my mother.
so? -There's nothing to worry about.
do you think so?
you won't believe how innocent the whole thing is.
Really?
for example, do you know how those letters get exchanged?
how? - But please...
...Cecile shouldn't know that I told you.
my dear.
they put them in the strings of the harp.
pity the fate of a fair young maiden searching the meadows and woods in fear useless for her to expend all her efforts. Or to flee when a shepherd draws near. lf at night, as she turns to go home, he who has watched her will then appear. She must yield to my magical powers. She cannot hope to keep her flower safe no matter how hard she try. I'm a great wizard, a wizard am l. I'm a great wizard, a wizard am l.
when you practice, mademoiselle, you have to watch out for this passage.
it's...
One-two-three.
your rhythm's quavering a bit.
you have to try and keep it steady.
your daughter's a wonderful student, madame.
take the cover off, Emile.
why, maman?
what is this?
what is this?
I don't know.
it's a letter, madame.
it's a letter I wrote to your daughter.
she doesn't know anything about it. She's telling the truth.
I'm glad to hear that, at least.
will you wait for me here, young man? Come along, Cecile.
come.
sit down.
now tell me the truth.
you knew about the letter, didn't you?
no, I didn't. I swear I didn't know.
ls this the first letter he wrote to you? - Yes.
so why are you locking your cabinet?
is it locked?
give me the key.
I don't know where it is.
it's hanging round your neck.
I'm sorry, maman.
forgive me. Please. I'm sorry.
please, maman, forgive me.
Madame
young man, you have abused my hospitality...
...and you have abused the innocence of my child.
you will never be admitted to this house again.
here are the letters you had the audacity to give to my daughter.
I want you to send me the letters she wrote to you and I want them today.
you may go. -But, madame
I don't want to have to call my footman.
Madame, I just want you to know that I've never abused your hospitality...
...and I will never give back the letters Cecile wrote to me.
in them, she opened her heart to me, not to you.
I won't betray her confidence.
her trust means more to me than all your anger.
good-bye.
No!
Chevalier!
do you remember me?
I have a letter for you from Cecile.
my dear Cecile...
...to be alone with you is my greatest desire.
and Madame de Merteuil...
...has devised a plan for us to meet.
she will explain all the details to you.
I'll invite you and your mother to the opera.
but maman has forbidden me even to leave the house for two weeks.
precisely.
which is why you will decline my invitation...
...Iike a good girl...
...so that your mother suspects nothing.
do you understand?
Yes.
then, when your mother and l...
...are just about to leave for the opera...
...I want you to run in and say...
Maman!
maman, may I come with you?
please? I promise... Maman.
let me come with you! Please! I want to go with you so much!
please?
my angel, don't think I don't love you, but you know perfectly well what you did...
...so stop acting like a silly child and go back to your room.
so, here's your dress.
let's change first.
Why?
because you want to look beautiful, don't you?
you want me to change into this?
Madame de Merteuil had it made especially for you.
Really?
who lives here?
no one.
take a sip, mademoiselle.
Madame de Merteuil has such exquisite taste.
but my legs show.
they look nice.
Mademoiselle, you look ravishing!
Mademoiselle, do you realize that we've never been alone before?
Yes.
please read it now.
Chevalier, this is a poem.
no. It's a song you know. I only wrote new words for it.
you stay. Stay.
what's the matter? - I can't sit still.
I keep thinking about Cecile.
it just broke my heart to see her so miserable.
I must go home. You stay.
love, lf you will come to me, l will be true to thee. Two lovers true are we.
no. You're making the same mistake again.
it's A in the right hand, not B-flat.
is this a long song, Chevalier?
is this a long song, Chevalier?
it's another 12 verses.
so?
what a nincompoop!
love, Flowers bloom in my heart.
sorry to interrupt. Cecile has to go.
Cecile, get dressed.
Why? - Get dressed.
your mother is on her way home. - My God!
don't panic, but we must hurry. - Madame.
how much can we trust your maid? - Madame!
your mother will question her.
yes? - We want to get married.
ls this true? - Yes, it is.
is it?
I think it is.
will you help us, please?
is this any time to discuss marriage?
Cecile!
martine! - Yes, madame?
where is Cecile?
Cecile?
she's...
...she has...
where is she?
have you been at your post all night?
Yes, madame.
has anyone come in? - No, madame.
Martine.
Yes, madame?
did she go and see that music teacher?
I don't know, madame. She doesn't talk to me anymore.
she only talks to Madame de Merteuil now.
and she...
she...
Emile.
maman. Forgive me, please, maman. Please.
I wanted to be with you so much!
my dear, don't be harsh with her. She's sorry. She's so sorry.
maman. - Cecile.
of course I forgive you.
Maman! Please, maman. I'm sorry.
please forgive me. Please!
maybe...
...I just don't understand her.
do you think she's ready to be married?
of course she is.
I even thought...
...of sending her back to the convent.
no.
no.
I would just get her out of Paris for a while.
if you like, I could take her to the country.
it isn't easy to find you.
I have a surprise for you.
Monsieur de Valmont...
...I must talk to you.
I know a place. Give me your hand. - No.
no.
why didn't you ever tell me?
what? - That you're such a brilliant archer.
what are you talking about? - Come, I'll show you. Give me your hand.
I'm a brilliant archer?
you'll see. Come on.
azolan.
what are you waiting for?
good boys.
here, sir.
but I've never shot an arrow in my life. - Put your hand here...
...and your other hand here.
there.
ready? - Yeah.
now let go.
what a shot!
I knew I was right.
you are a brilliant archer.
now, if you were to take this coin...
...and throw it in that bush, what do you suppose would happen?
may I read you something? - Yes.
this letter is from a close friend of mine.
all his life, Monsieur de Valmont has been and is...
...a consummate master of the art of seduction.
hundreds of women, and I am not exaggerating, madame...
...have paid for it.
he has charmed his countless victims...
...designing his every gesture, every word, every smile...
...in a cold-blooded scheme...
...that has only one squalid end:
to destroy the woman's honor.
is this true?
who wrote that?
is it?
Monsieur de Valmont, don't waste your time on me.
I am not, and I never will be, one of those women.
I know that.
so, why do you keep trying?
I don't even know.
Vicomte.
can we offer you a ride?
look who I brought with me.
you remember my little cousin. - Good afternoon.
would you like to join us?
these violent delights have violent ends...
and in their triumph die, like fire and powder...
which, as they kiss, consume...
gran?
Edward, don't! She will see you.
okay.
grandma, I would like you to meet...
happy birthday, Bella.
happy birthday, Bells.
I thought we agreed, no presents.
well, the one from me is not wrapped.
so, don't count.
it's actually great. Thanks, Dad.
uh, goes with this one from your mom.
we coordinated. Well, she coordinated me.
it's to put your pictures in, from senior year.
senior year.
how'd you get so old so fast? - I didn't.
it's not that old. - I don't know.
is that a grey hair?
No! No way!
happy Birthday.
it's really funny.
another missing hiker brings the total to three presumed deaths.
the Rangers are searching for the killer animal...
Oh, it's Bella. Bella!
today is the big day, Bella.
uh, "R and J essay" due? - Oh, yeah!
wherefore art thou, Bella?
I wanna take a picture of you guys. My Mom...
wants me to put together, like...
a scrapbook full of memories. - Oh, of course, yeah.
I take them, I'm not in them. - No, no, no, come here.
you'll photoshop my nose if it looks big, right?
don't worry, I'm in the picture. No one will be looking at you guys.
it's good.
Oh, good. Cullen's here.
well, catch you later.
happy birthday. - Don't remind me.
Bella, your birth is definitely something to celebrate.
but my aging is not. - Your aging?
I think 18 is all youngster, don't worry about that.
it's one year older than you.
no, it isn't.
I'm a hundred and nine. - Wow!
maybe I should not be dating such an old man.
it's gross!
I should feel certainly repulsed.
we have to go to class. - Ok.
wait a second.
someone wants you.
Bella. - Jacob!
I'll leave you to talk.
Hello, biceps!
you know, anabolic steroids are really bad for you.
well, I'm just filling out, Bella.
you know, wouldn't seem so drastic if we hung out more.
we should switch schools.
then you can come hang out with the pale faces.
I'm alright.
I prefer the Res school's exclusivity.
they let any old rift raft into this place.
I see. Why are you summing it?
I was just buying a part for the "Rabbit."
you should really come, take a ride, when it's done.
is it fast? - Huh, it's decent.
okay. - Okay, good.
Hey, happy birthday.
your Dad told my Dad. So...
Yeah, of course, he did.
I saw this the other day and thought of you.
it catches bad dreams.
it's perfect.
thank you. - No problem.
see you soon. Bye. - Yeah, see you later.
so, how come Jacob Black gets to give you a gift and I don't?
because I have nothing to give back to you.
Bella, you give me everything just by breathing.
see? Thank you. That's all I want.
Bella!
happy Birthday! - Shhh!
I thought, I said no presents.
I've already seen you open it and guess what?
you love it!
you're gonna wear it tonight, our place.
come on, please? It will be fun.
okay. alright. - Great! Okay, I'll see you at 7: 00.
Jasper, no fair with the mood control thing.
sorry, Bella.
happy...
never mind.
you can't trust vampires.
trust me!
o, my love! My wife!
death that hath sucked the honey of thy breath.
hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
thou art not conquered.
beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks.
and death's pale flag is not advanced there.
I hate being celebrated.
there are worse tragedies.
hm, look at Romeo.
he kills his true love out of sheer stupidity.
Yeah.
though I do envy him, one thing.
Juliet. She's like perfect.
if you like that obviously beautiful sort of thing.
no, not the girl, dear.
the suicide.
it's nearly impossible for some people.
for humans, a little poison...
a dagger to the heart...
so many different options.
why would you say that?
because I considered it once.
I didn't know, if I'd get to you in time.
I had to come up with some kind of...
plan.
and what was the plan?
I would go to Italy, and provoke the Volturi.
the what? - The Volturi...
now, who would like to repeat the last few lines...
just to show, they were paying attention?
Mr. Cullen.
Oh, yes, Mr. Birdy.
will I set up my everlasting rest,
and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world-wearied flesh.
eyes, look your last!
arms, take your last embrace!
and lips, O you, the doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss.
a dateless bargain to engrossing death!
eyes on the screen, people.
thus with a kiss I die.
the Volturi are a very old, very powerful family.
I guess, the closest thing to royalty my world has.
is that Carlisle? - Yeah.
he lived with them for a few decades.
described them as very refined.
no respect for human life, of course, but...
respect for the arts and science as at least.
and the law...
above all of law.
and vampires have laws?
not very many.
there's only one and it's regularly enforced.
what is it?
to keep the existence of our kind a secret.
we don't make spectacles of ourselves, and we don't kill conspicuously.
unless, of course, you want to die.
we have to stop talking about that.
I can't even think about someone hurting you.
Bella, the only thing that can hurt me is you.
and I don't have anything else to be afraid of.
that's not true.
Victoria? She will come for me one day.
Alice will see what she decides and...
we will be ready. - I can protect you.
if you change me.
Bella, you already do protect me.
you're my only reason to stay alive, if that's what I am.
but it's my job to protect you.
from everyone... except my sister.
it's time!
it's time! It's time! It's time!
sorry about all this. We tried to rein Alice in.
like it's even possible.
happy big Birthday, Bella! - Thanks.
I found it in your bag, mind?
dating an older woman? Hot!
what?
you first, Rosalie.
it's a necklace.
Alice picked it up. - Thanks.
show me the love!
this is from Emmett.
already installed it in your truck.
finally, a decent sound system for that piece of...
Hey, don't... don't hate the truck.
open Esme and Carlisle's.
just a little something to brighten your day.
we think, you looking kind of pale lately.
paper cut.
Jas... Jas!
it's okay. It's just a little...
blood.
get Jasper out of here.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry, I can't.
I'll have to stitch this up in my office.
check on Jasper.
I'm sure, he's very upset with himself.
and I doubt he'll listen to anyone but you right now.
Edward?
I never wanted that party. - It's not your fault.
Jasper hasn't been away from human blood as long as the rest of us.
how do you do it?
years and years of practice.
did you ever think it of...
just doing it the easier way?
no.
I knew who I wanted to be.
I wanted to help people.
brings me happiness.
even if I'm damned about this.
damned?
like... like hell?
Carlisle, you can't be damned.
you couldn't, it's impossible.
thank you, Bella.
you always been very...
gracious about us.
so, that's it?
that's why he won't change me?
imagine the situation in reverse.
if you believed as Edward does...
would you take away his soul?
you can't protect me from everything.
at some point, something's gonna separate us.
it's gonna be an accident, or illness, or old age.
as long as I'm human.
and the only solution is to change me.
that's not a solution, it's a tragedy.
you're not gonna love me when I look like a grandmother.
Bella, do you not understand my feelings for you? No?
Carlisle told me...
how you feel about your soul.
I don't believe that.
so don't worry about mine.
you should go inside.
it's still my birthday.
can I ask one thing?
kiss me?
I love you.
I love you.
Hi.
come for a walk with me.
we got to leave Forks.
Why?
Carlisle's supposed to be ten years older than he looks.
people are starting to notice.
okay, I...
I gotta think of something to say to Charlie.
when you say "we..."
I mean to my family and myself.
Edward, what happened with Jasper, - it's nothing. - You're right.
it was nothing.
nothing the way I always expected.
and nothing compared to what could have happened.
you just don't belong to my world, Bella.
I belong with you.
no, you don't.
I'm coming.
Bella.
I don't want you to come.
you don't want me?
no.
this changes things. A lot.
alright.
but if it's not too much to ask...
can you at least promise me something?
don't do anything reckless.
for Charlie's sake.
and I'll promise something to you in return.
this is the last time you'll ever see me.
I won't come back.
and you can go on with your life...
without any interference from me.
it will be like...
I never existed, I promise.
if this is about my soul, take it.
I don't want without you. - It's not about your soul.
you're just not good for me.
I'm not good enough for you?
I'm just sorry, I let this go on for so long.
please...
don't.
goodbye.
Edward?
Edward!
Edward!
I'll try to call Cullens place again.
the Cullens left town, Charlie. - Good riddance!
where did they go?
we'll find her, Charlie. - Thanks, Harry.
Charlie?
she's alright.
I got her.
thank you, Sam.
Alice, you have disappeared.
like everything else.
but who else can I talk to? I'm lost.
when you left...
and he left...
you took everything with you.
but the absence of him is everywhere I look...
it's like a huge hole has been punched through my chest.
but in a way I'm glad.
the pain is my only reminder that he was real...
that you all were.
alright, that's it.
what?
you're going to Jacksonville to live with your mother.
I'm not leaving Forks.
bells...
he's not coming back.
I know.
it's just not normal, this behavior.
quite frankly, it's scaring the hell outta me, and you Mother.
baby, I... I don't want you to leave.
I don't.
but... just go...
go to Jacksonville, make some new friends...
I like my old friends. - Well, you never see them anymore.
I do, yeah.
I'm...gonna go shopping tomorrow, with Jessica.
you hate shopping.
I...
I need a girl's night out.
alright. Girl's night.
shopping.
I like it, go.
buy some good stuff.
Hi, Jessica, it's Bella.
Oh, yeah, Bella Swan.
I don't know, why you wanna sit through all those zombies eating people, and no hot guys kissing anybody. It's gross.
like why there are so many zombie movies anyway?
is it supposed to like draw a parallel with leprosy?
my cousin had leprosy, it's not funny, you know?
and like is it supposed to be a metaphor for consumerism?
because don't be so pleased with your own like...
self-reverential cleverness, you know?
like, some girls like to shop.
not all girls, apparently.
I was surprised you called at all, you know?
like, your depression thing. I get it. I'm totally... totally worried.
after a while, it's like, she's still bumming?
and I'm going through stuff too, you know?
like Mike deciding he wanted to "just be friends?
that's hard, you know?
what's up, guys?
where you going?
keep walking.
this is dangerous.
dude, come on.
I think, I know those guys.
well, they seem great. Can we go?
I just need to see something.
Hey, girlie!
alright, alright! We got a taker.
turn around.
sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
that's cool! I'll be whomever you want to be, honey.
so, what do you say?
you promised me nothing reckless.
you promised, it would as you never existed.
you lied. - Say some, babe?
you know what? Never mind.
stop!
stop! Stop! Stop!
Hey, um, what the hell is wrong with you?
just curious.
I thought that I saw something.
you're insane, actually. Or suicidal.
that homeboy could have been a psycho.
I was about to end up in a FBI interview room, like some lame TV show.
Oh, that was such a rush.
awesome!
so, you're an adrenaline junky now?
that's cool! You can go bungee jumping.
you don't get on the back of some random loser's motorcycle!
crazy!
Alice, I saw him.
maybe I'm crazy now, but I guess that's okay.
if the rush of danger is what it takes to see him...
then that's what I'll find.
Bella!
where the hell have you been, my god!
I... brought you something. - Okay.
it's a little crazy.
wow, scrap metal!
you shouldn't have. - I saved them from the junkyard.
I think, they'll probably cost more to fix than they're worth.
but then I thought that...
if I had a mechanic-type friend to help me out...
huh, me?
being the mechanic-type friend? - That's right.
since when are you into motorcycles? - Since now.
I get it if you think this is really stupid and reckless.
Yeah, it's completely stupid and reckless.
when do we start?
now. Please. - Alright.
Oh, hey, be careful. These things are actually really...
heavy. So,
jacob, you're like buff.
how that can happen? You're like 16, I don't get it.
age is just a number, baby. What, you're like 40, now?
feels like that sometimes.
that song was good. You don't like it?
I don't really like music anymore kind of...
okay. No more music.
I was thinking, if we're gonna do this everyday, and hopefully we will...
we have to, like, fit some homework in there somewhere.
I don't want Billy thinking that I'm a bad influence on you.
you influence me? Please.
are you...? I'm older than you.
so that makes me the influencer and you the influence.
no, no, no.
my size and knowledge base actually makes me older than you.
because of your gentle paleness and lack of know-how.
I convinced you to build two-wheeled death machines with me.
don't you think that makes you funny, young and naive?
okay. So, where do we stand?
I'm thirty five...
and you might be like 32. - Come on.
yo, Jake, you in there? - No, it's okay.
it's... It's just my boys.
Hey, Jake. - Hey. Guys, this is Bella.
Bella, that's Quil and Embry.
I'm Quil Ateara.
so the bike building story is true.
Oh, yeah, yeah! I taught him everything he knows.
what about the part where you're his girlfriend?
uh, we're friends, you know? - Hmm. Burn!
actually, I remember, I said she's a girl and a friend.
Embry, do you remember him making that distinction?
Nope!
so you guys have girlfriends. It's awesome.
Yeah, right.
Quil's actually taken his cousin to prom.
Yeah, that's still a riot.
you want funny, Black? I'll give you funny.
Jesus!
I got five bucks on Quil. - You're on.
dear Alice, I wish, I had your real address.
I wish, I could tell you about Jake.
he makes me feel better.
I mean, he makes me feel alive.
the hole in my chest...
while when I'm with Jake,
it's like, it almost healed. For a while.
Quil keeps asking to come over.
I think he likes you a little too much.
Oh, I'm really not into the whole cougar thing, you know?
what's up with you and age?
I mean, how old was that Cullen guy anyway?
but even Jake can't keep the dreams away.
Hey, Bella!
you're alright. You're okay? - No.
I thought this thing was starting to work, but I guess not.
can I ask you something?
hanging out with Jacob does seems to take your mind off things for a bit, doesn't it?
you know, sometimes...
you gotta learn to love what's good for you.
you know, what I mean?
of course, what do I know?
I'm just a terminal bachelor.
famous ladies man.
okay...
go to bed.
I love you.
if I told you,
I couldn't have fixed these bikes, what would you say?
are you doubting your mad skills?
no, definitely not. I mean, they're all fine.
it's just...
may be if I was smarter would have dragged out to rebuild them.
if you told me, you couldn't fix these bikes.
I would say that that's really too bad but...
we're gonna find something else to do.
is that Sam Uley?
Yeah, and his cult.
Oh, my God!
did you see that?
they're not really fighting, Bella.
they're cliff diving.
scary as hell, but a total rush.
rush? - Most of us jump from lower down.
we'll leave the showing off to Sam and his disciples.
is some kind of beef with them or something?
Oh, no.
they just think they run this place.
Embry used to call them hall monitors on steroids.
now, look at him.
that's Embry?
Yeah. - What happened to him?
he missed some school...
and all of a sudden started following Sam around like a little puppy.
same thing with Paul and Jared.
Sam keeps giving me this look, like he's waiting for me or something.
it's kinda starting to freak me out.
well, you should just avoid him.
I'll try.
okay.
you look scared. - I'm not.
alright! Brake.
clutch. Good.
gas.
ready?
now slowly... release the clutch.
stop.
you alright?
I'm gonna go again.
hit the brake!
I wanna go again. - Are you trying to get yourself killed?
I'll try again. - No, forget it.
no more bikes.
man, your head.
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
you're apologizing for bleeding?
Yeah, I guess, I am.
it's just blood, Bella. No big deal.
what are you staring at?
you're sort of beautiful.
how hard did you hit your head?
I don't know.
let's go.
I did see something in the woods. - Sure, baby, I believe you.
no, he doesn't. He's just trying to get lucky.
it was jet black and huge.
on all fours, it was still taller than a person.
a bear, may be?
or an alien. You're lucky that you didn't get probed.
Oh, yeah.
well, I saw it.
you're not the only one.
my Dad's been getting reports at the station.
like five hikers been killed by some bear.
but they can't find the bear.
last time you clowns doubt my girlfriend.
so, I mean...
Bella is back.
Yeah, I guess so. - Huh, that's... Welcome.
so listen, not now that... You know, you're talking and...eating again, you know?
you gotta get that protein in there.
I was just wondering, if you wanted to go see a movie with me.
Yeah, sure. Yeah, I do.
cool, um, let me see...
we could check out "Love spelled backwards is love.
Yeah, it's a dumb title, but, um, it's a romantic comedy.
I mean, it's supposed to be. - No. No romance.
how about "Face Punch"? You heard of that?
well, it's an action movie. - Yeah, it's perfect.
with guns... adrenaline...
it's my thing - Okay.
we should get a bunch of people to go. Do you guys wanna go see...
face Punch? - "Face Punch"? Yeah!
Mike, hey, we were supposed to watch that?
remember the trailer's like... - Yeah?
punch his face in. - I don't remember that.
movie night with Bella!
so, "Face Punch," huh? You like action movies?
not really.
I heard it sucks. Bad.
Hey, are you even old enough to see this movie?
I mean, you know, without adult supervision? - Right, yeah.
well, she's buying my ticket for me. - She's buying it, okay.
Jessica bailed and Angela's got the stomach flu so Eric's taking care of her.
so, it's just us three. - Great.
great. - Yeah.
put the gun down.
put your gun down or I'm gonna blow your freaking head off.
both of you!
put both of your guns down or I'm gonna blow both of your freaking heads off.
alright, let's do this!
okay, I think I'm gonna throw up!
Jesus! - What a marshmallow!
you should hold out for someone with a stronger stomach.
someone who laughs at the gore that makes weaker men vomit.
Yeah, I'll keep my eye open for that.
I feel bad. He probably has that flu that's...
going around.
what? I can't hold your hand? - No, of course, you can.
I just think it means something really different to you.
so...
okay, tell me something. You like me, right?
and you think, I'm sorta beautiful?
Jake, please... don't do this.
Why?
because you are about to ruin everything.
and I need you.
well, I've got loads of time.
I'm not gonna give up.
I don't want you to.
but...
it's just because I don't want you to go anywhere.
it's... it's really selfish.
you know, I'm not like a car that you can fix up.
I'm never gonna run right.
so I should be fair to you.
it's because of him, right?
look, I know what he did to you.
but, Bella, I would never, ever do that.
I won't ever hurt you. I promise.
I won't let you down.
you can count on me.
well...
I need to go home.
I'm... I was feeling sick before the movie, okay?
what is your problem? - Right now?
you are my problem.
feeling sick? Maybe you need to go to the hospital.
do you want me to put you in the hospital?
Jake... Jake, the movie's over. What are you doing?
Jake, you're really hot.
like, you feel like you have a fever. Are you okay?
I don't know what's happening.
I gotta go.
that dude is weird.
Jake.
uh, your Dad says you have mono.
he won't let me visit but... would you call me?
Hey, uh, it's me again. I just...
I'm sorry about what I said at the movie theatre.
I just wanted to hear your voice. So, no pressure.
jacob, please call me.
okay, we should be back around three.
Hey!
look, I don't have to go fishing today. - Yes, you do.
Yeah, you do. Go. What are you talking about?
just be careful. - I always am.
those bears won't get the drop on me, Bella.
my kung foo is strong.
Jake!
you cut your hair?
and got a tattoo?
Bella...
I thought you were too sick to come outside.
or pick up the phone when I'd call.
go away. - What?
go away.
what happened to you? What's wrong?
Hey, what happened?
did Sam get to you? Is that what's happening?
Sam's trying to help me, don't blame him.
but if you want somebody to blame,
how about those filthy bloodsuckers, you love?
the Cullens.
I don't know what are you talking about.
you know exactly what I'm talking about.
you've been lying to everyone. Charlie...
but you can't lie to me.
not anymore, Bella. - Come on! Jacob!
look, Bella...
we can't be friends anymore.
Jake, I know that I have been...
...hurting you.
it's... it's killing me. It kills me.
if you, may be, give me like some time or something.
don't!
it's not you.
it's not you, it's me, right? Really?
it's true! It is me.
I'm not good.
I used to be... a good kid.
not anymore.
it doesn't even matter, alright? This is over.
you can't break up with me.
I mean...
I mean, you're my best friend.
you promised me.
I know.
I promised that I won't hurt you, Bella.
and this is me keeping that promise.
go home.
and don't come back. Or you're gonna get hurt.
things are...
things are bad again.
without Jake, I just... I can't stand it.
I don't see Edward anymore.
now it really feels like he never existed.
I will find a place where I can see him again.
I didn't expect to find you here.
I went to visit the Cullens, but... the house is empty.
I'm surprised they left you behind.
weren't you sort of a, um, ...a pet of theirs?
Yeah. You could say that.
do they Cullens visit often?
lie.
Yeah, absolutely, all the time. - Lie better.
I'll tell them that you stopped by.
I probably shouldn't tell to Edward.
because he's pretty protective. - But he's far away, isn't he?
why are you here?
I came as a favor to Victoria.
she asked me to see if you were still under the protection of the Cullens.
victoria feels it's only fair to kill Edward's mate given he killed hers.
an eye for an eye.
threaten him. - Edward would know who did it!
and he'd come after you.
I don't think he will.
after all, how much could you mean to him...
...if he left you here unprotected?
victoria won't be happy about me killing you.
but I can't help myself.
you're so mouthwatering. - Please, don't!
I mean, you'd helped us. - Shhhh!
don't be afraid. I'm doing you a kindness.
victoria plans on killing you slowly, painfully, ...where as I'll make it quick. I promise.
you will feel nothing.
Edward, I love you.
I don't believe it.
dad, I saw them!
what's the matter? - In the woods. They are not bears!
what you mean in the woods?
Bella, what the hell were you doing out in the woods?
they are wolves. I mean, they're like huge wolves!
are you sure about that, Bella? - Yeah, I just saw them.
they were after... something.
wolves? You saw?
alright. Well, Harry, ...feel like going hunting?
can you get some of your guys together?
sure, yeah. I'll... I'll just...
I know that those wolves will be dead.
and Laurent would have told her I'm unprotected.
Victoria.
I should go to the station.
dad, you should... You should go.
you can just stay in the house?
Oh, you scared me.
what the hell are you doing? - Back up. I'm coming up.
look, look, I'm sorry.
for what? - I wish I could explain, ...but I literally... can't!
have you ever had a secret you couldn't tell anyone?
one that wasn't yours to share.
well, that's what it's like for me.
or worse.
you have no idea, how tight I'm bounded.
I hate this.
I hate what they have done to you.
I mean, the killer part is you already know!
Bella, do you remember, when walked on the beach in La Push?
the story...
the story... The story about the cold ones.
I guees, I understand why that's the only part you remember.
there must gotta be something you can do...
no. I'm in it for life.
may be we should just get out of here for a while.
we'll just leave. Just you and me.
you can do that?
I'll do it for you.
it's not something I can just run away from, Bella.
but I would run away with you.
if I could.
I gotta go. They'll certainly wonder where I am.
come here.
please... Try to remember.
it would be so much easier if you knew...
I tried, but... Jake.
Jake, what are you doing? Wait, Jake.
Edward, I'm scared.
you should be.
really it's just like an old story...
that we're not supposed to say anything about...
did you know, the Quileute are supposed to be descendants from wolves?
I need to see him.
he's not in.
I'm sorry, really need to see him. - Bella?
what did you do?
okay, what did you do? - Hey!
what did you do to him? - Easy!
he didn't want this! - But we do.
what did he do? What did he tell you? - Both of you calm...
nothing! He told me nothing, because he's scared of you!
too late, now. - Bella, get back.
Paul, calm down now.
run!
Jake, run!
these violent delights have violent ends...
and in their triumph die, like fire and powder...
which, as they kiss, consume...
gran?
Edward, don't! She will see you.
okay.
grandma, I would like you to meet...
happy birthday, Bella.
happy birthday, Bells.
I thought we agreed, no presents.
well, the one from me is not wrapped.
so, don't count.
it's actually great. Thanks, Dad.
uh, goes with this one from your mom.
we coordinated. Well, she coordinated me.
it's to put your pictures in, from senior year.
senior year.
how'd you get so old so fast? - I didn't.
it's not that old. - I don't know.
is that a grey hair?
No! No way!
happy Birthday.
it's really funny.
another missing hiker brings the total to three presumed deaths.
the Rangers are searching for the killer animal...
Oh, it's Bella. Bella!
today is the big day, Bella.
uh, "R and J essay" due? - Oh, yeah!
wherefore art thou, Bella?
I wanna take a picture of you guys. My Mom...
wants me to put together, like...
a scrapbook full of memories. - Oh, of course, yeah.
I take them, I'm not in them. - No, no, no, come here.
you'll photoshop my nose if it looks big, right?
don't worry, I'm in the picture. No one will be looking at you guys.
it's good.
Oh, good. Cullen's here.
well, catch you later.
happy birthday. - Don't remind me.
Bella, your birth is definitely something to celebrate.
but my aging is not. - Your aging?
I think 18 is all youngster, don't worry about that.
it's one year older than you.
no, it isn't.
I'm a hundred and nine. - Wow!
maybe I should not be dating such an old man.
it's gross!
I should feel certainly repulsed.
we have to go to class. - Ok.
wait a second.
someone wants you.
Bella. - Jacob!
I'll leave you to talk.
Hello, biceps!
you know, anabolic steroids are really bad for you.
well, I'm just filling out, Bella.
you know, wouldn't seem so drastic if we hung out more.
we should switch schools.
then you can come hang out with the pale faces.
I'm alright.
I prefer the Res school's exclusivity.
they let any old rift raft into this place.
I see. Why are you summing it?
I was just buying a part for the "Rabbit."
you should really come, take a ride, when it's done.
is it fast? - Huh, it's decent.
okay. - Okay, good.
Hey, happy birthday.
your Dad told my Dad. So...
Yeah, of course, he did.
I saw this the other day and thought of you.
it catches bad dreams.
it's perfect.
thank you. - No problem.
see you soon. Bye. - Yeah, see you later.
so, how come Jacob Black gets to give you a gift and I don't?
because I have nothing to give back to you.
Bella, you give me everything just by breathing.
see? Thank you. That's all I want.
Bella!
happy Birthday! - Shhh!
I thought, I said no presents.
I've already seen you open it and guess what?
you love it!
you're gonna wear it tonight, our place.
come on, please? It will be fun.
okay. alright. - Great! Okay, I'll see you at 7: 00.
Jasper, no fair with the mood control thing.
sorry, Bella.
happy...
never mind.
you can't trust vampires.
trust me!
o, my love! My wife!
death that hath sucked the honey of thy breath.
hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
thou art not conquered.
beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks.
and death's pale flag is not advanced there.
I hate being celebrated.
there are worse tragedies.
hm, look at Romeo.
he kills his true love out of sheer stupidity.
Yeah.
though I do envy him, one thing.
Juliet. She's like perfect.
if you like that obviously beautiful sort of thing.
no, not the girl, dear.
the suicide.
it's nearly impossible for some people.
for humans, a little poison...
a dagger to the heart...
so many different options.
why would you say that?
because I considered it once.
I didn't know, if I'd get to you in time.
I had to come up with some kind of...
plan.
and what was the plan?
I would go to Italy, and provoke the Volturi.
the what? - The Volturi...
now, who would like to repeat the last few lines...
just to show, they were paying attention?
Mr. Cullen.
Oh, yes, Mr. Birdy.
will I set up my everlasting rest,
and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world-wearied flesh.
eyes, look your last!
arms, take your last embrace!
and lips, O you, the doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss.
a dateless bargain to engrossing death!
eyes on the screen, people.
thus with a kiss I die.
the Volturi are a very old, very powerful family.
I guess, the closest thing to royalty my world has.
is that Carlisle? - Yeah.
he lived with them for a few decades.
described them as very refined.
no respect for human life, of course, but...
respect for the arts and science as at least.
and the law...
above all of law.
and vampires have laws?
not very many.
there's only one and it's regularly enforced.
what is it?
to keep the existence of our kind a secret.
we don't make spectacles of ourselves, and we don't kill conspicuously.
unless, of course, you want to die.
we have to stop talking about that.
I can't even think about someone hurting you.
Bella, the only thing that can hurt me is you.
and I don't have anything else to be afraid of.
that's not true.
Victoria? She will come for me one day.
Alice will see what she decides and...
we will be ready. - I can protect you.
if you change me.
Bella, you already do protect me.
you're my only reason to stay alive, if that's what I am.
but it's my job to protect you.
from everyone... except my sister.
it's time!
it's time! It's time! It's time!
sorry about all this. We tried to rein Alice in.
like it's even possible.
happy big Birthday, Bella! - Thanks.
I found it in your bag, mind?
dating an older woman? Hot!
what?
you first, Rosalie.
it's a necklace.
Alice picked it up. - Thanks.
show me the love!
this is from Emmett.
already installed it in your truck.
finally, a decent sound system for that piece of...
Hey, don't... don't hate the truck.
open Esme and Carlisle's.
just a little something to brighten your day.
we think, you looking kind of pale lately.
paper cut.
Jas... Jas!
it's okay. It's just a little...
blood.
get Jasper out of here.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry, I can't.
I'll have to stitch this up in my office.
check on Jasper.
I'm sure, he's very upset with himself.
and I doubt he'll listen to anyone but you right now.
Edward?
I never wanted that party. - It's not your fault.
Jasper hasn't been away from human blood as long as the rest of us.
how do you do it?
years and years of practice.
did you ever think it of...
just doing it the easier way?
no.
I knew who I wanted to be.
I wanted to help people.
brings me happiness.
even if I'm damned about this.
damned?
like... like hell?
Carlisle, you can't be damned.
you couldn't, it's impossible.
thank you, Bella.
you always been very...
gracious about us.
so, that's it?
that's why he won't change me?
imagine the situation in reverse.
if you believed as Edward does...
would you take away his soul?
you can't protect me from everything.
at some point, something's gonna separate us.
it's gonna be an accident, or illness, or old age.
as long as I'm human.
and the only solution is to change me.
that's not a solution, it's a tragedy.
you're not gonna love me when I look like a grandmother.
Bella, do you not understand my feelings for you? No?
Carlisle told me...
how you feel about your soul.
I don't believe that.
so don't worry about mine.
you should go inside.
it's still my birthday.
can I ask one thing?
kiss me?
I love you.
I love you.
Hi.
come for a walk with me.
we got to leave Forks.
Why?
Carlisle's supposed to be ten years older than he looks.
people are starting to notice.
okay, I...
I gotta think of something to say to Charlie.
when you say "we..."
I mean to my family and myself.
Edward, what happened with Jasper, - it's nothing. - You're right.
it was nothing.
nothing the way I always expected.
and nothing compared to what could have happened.
you just don't belong to my world, Bella.
I belong with you.
no, you don't.
I'm coming.
Bella.
I don't want you to come.
you don't want me?
no.
this changes things. A lot.
alright.
but if it's not too much to ask...
can you at least promise me something?
don't do anything reckless.
for Charlie's sake.
and I'll promise something to you in return.
this is the last time you'll ever see me.
I won't come back.
and you can go on with your life...
without any interference from me.
it will be like...
I never existed, I promise.
if this is about my soul, take it.
I don't want without you. - It's not about your soul.
you're just not good for me.
I'm not good enough for you?
I'm just sorry, I let this go on for so long.
please...
don't.
goodbye.
Edward?
Edward!
Edward!
I'll try to call Cullens place again.
the Cullens left town, Charlie. - Good riddance!
where did they go?
we'll find her, Charlie. - Thanks, Harry.
Charlie?
she's alright.
I got her.
thank you, Sam.
Alice, you have disappeared.
like everything else.
but who else can I talk to? I'm lost.
when you left...
and he left...
you took everything with you.
but the absence of him is everywhere I look...
it's like a huge hole has been punched through my chest.
but in a way I'm glad.
the pain is my only reminder that he was real...
that you all were.
alright, that's it.
what?
you're going to Jacksonville to live with your mother.
I'm not leaving Forks.
bells...
he's not coming back.
I know.
it's just not normal, this behavior.
quite frankly, it's scaring the hell outta me, and you Mother.
baby, I... I don't want you to leave.
I don't.
but... just go...
go to Jacksonville, make some new friends...
I like my old friends. - Well, you never see them anymore.
I do, yeah.
I'm...gonna go shopping tomorrow, with Jessica.
you hate shopping.
I...
I need a girl's night out.
alright. Girl's night.
shopping.
I like it, go.
buy some good stuff.
Hi, Jessica, it's Bella.
Oh, yeah, Bella Swan.
I don't know, why you wanna sit through all those zombies eating people, and no hot guys kissing anybody. It's gross.
like why there are so many zombie movies anyway?
is it supposed to like draw a parallel with leprosy?
my cousin had leprosy, it's not funny, you know?
and like is it supposed to be a metaphor for consumerism?
because don't be so pleased with your own like...
self-reverential cleverness, you know?
like, some girls like to shop.
not all girls, apparently.
I was surprised you called at all, you know?
like, your depression thing. I get it. I'm totally... totally worried.
after a while, it's like, she's still bumming?
and I'm going through stuff too, you know?
like Mike deciding he wanted to "just be friends?
that's hard, you know?
what's up, guys?
where you going?
keep walking.
this is dangerous.
dude, come on.
I think, I know those guys.
well, they seem great. Can we go?
I just need to see something.
Hey, girlie!
alright, alright! We got a taker.
turn around.
sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
that's cool! I'll be whomever you want to be, honey.
so, what do you say?
you promised me nothing reckless.
you promised, it would as you never existed.
you lied. - Say some, babe?
you know what? Never mind.
stop!
stop! Stop! Stop!
Hey, um, what the hell is wrong with you?
just curious.
I thought that I saw something.
you're insane, actually. Or suicidal.
that homeboy could have been a psycho.
I was about to end up in a FBI interview room, like some lame TV show.
Oh, that was such a rush.
awesome!
so, you're an adrenaline junky now?
that's cool! You can go bungee jumping.
you don't get on the back of some random loser's motorcycle!
crazy!
Alice, I saw him.
maybe I'm crazy now, but I guess that's okay.
if the rush of danger is what it takes to see him...
then that's what I'll find.
Bella!
where the hell have you been, my god!
I... brought you something. - Okay.
it's a little crazy.
wow, scrap metal!
you shouldn't have. - I saved them from the junkyard.
I think, they'll probably cost more to fix than they're worth.
but then I thought that...
if I had a mechanic-type friend to help me out...
huh, me?
being the mechanic-type friend? - That's right.
since when are you into motorcycles? - Since now.
I get it if you think this is really stupid and reckless.
Yeah, it's completely stupid and reckless.
when do we start?
now. Please. - Alright.
Oh, hey, be careful. These things are actually really...
heavy. So,
jacob, you're like buff.
how that can happen? You're like 16, I don't get it.
age is just a number, baby. What, you're like 40, now?
feels like that sometimes.
that song was good. You don't like it?
I don't really like music anymore kind of...
okay. No more music.
I was thinking, if we're gonna do this everyday, and hopefully we will...
we have to, like, fit some homework in there somewhere.
I don't want Billy thinking that I'm a bad influence on you.
you influence me? Please.
are you...? I'm older than you.
so that makes me the influencer and you the influence.
no, no, no.
my size and knowledge base actually makes me older than you.
because of your gentle paleness and lack of know-how.
I convinced you to build two-wheeled death machines with me.
don't you think that makes you funny, young and naive?
okay. So, where do we stand?
I'm thirty five...
and you might be like 32. - Come on.
yo, Jake, you in there? - No, it's okay.
it's... It's just my boys.
Hey, Jake. - Hey. Guys, this is Bella.
Bella, that's Quil and Embry.
I'm Quil Ateara.
so the bike building story is true.
Oh, yeah, yeah! I taught him everything he knows.
what about the part where you're his girlfriend?
uh, we're friends, you know? - Hmm. Burn!
actually, I remember, I said she's a girl and a friend.
Embry, do you remember him making that distinction?
Nope!
so you guys have girlfriends. It's awesome.
Yeah, right.
Quil's actually taken his cousin to prom.
Yeah, that's still a riot.
you want funny, Black? I'll give you funny.
Jesus!
I got five bucks on Quil. - You're on.
dear Alice, I wish, I had your real address.
I wish, I could tell you about Jake.
he makes me feel better.
I mean, he makes me feel alive.
the hole in my chest...
while when I'm with Jake,
it's like, it almost healed. For a while.
Quil keeps asking to come over.
I think he likes you a little too much.
Oh, I'm really not into the whole cougar thing, you know?
what's up with you and age?
I mean, how old was that Cullen guy anyway?
but even Jake can't keep the dreams away.
Hey, Bella!
you're alright. You're okay? - No.
I thought this thing was starting to work, but I guess not.
can I ask you something?
hanging out with Jacob does seems to take your mind off things for a bit, doesn't it?
you know, sometimes...
you gotta learn to love what's good for you.
you know, what I mean?
of course, what do I know?
I'm just a terminal bachelor.
famous ladies man.
okay...
go to bed.
I love you.
if I told you,
I couldn't have fixed these bikes, what would you say?
are you doubting your mad skills?
no, definitely not. I mean, they're all fine.
it's just...
may be if I was smarter would have dragged out to rebuild them.
if you told me, you couldn't fix these bikes.
I would say that that's really too bad but...
we're gonna find something else to do.
is that Sam Uley?
Yeah, and his cult.
Oh, my God!
did you see that?
they're not really fighting, Bella.
they're cliff diving.
scary as hell, but a total rush.
rush? - Most of us jump from lower down.
we'll leave the showing off to Sam and his disciples.
is some kind of beef with them or something?
Oh, no.
they just think they run this place.
Embry used to call them hall monitors on steroids.
now, look at him.
that's Embry?
Yeah. - What happened to him?
he missed some school...
and all of a sudden started following Sam around like a little puppy.
same thing with Paul and Jared.
Sam keeps giving me this look, like he's waiting for me or something.
it's kinda starting to freak me out.
well, you should just avoid him.
what are you staring at?
you're sort of beautiful.
how hard did you hit your head?
I don't know.
let's go.
I did see something in the woods. - Sure, baby, I believe you.
no, he doesn't. He's just trying to get lucky.
it was jet black and huge.
on all fours, it was still taller than a person.
a bear, may be?
or an alien. You're lucky that you didn't get probed.
Oh, yeah.
well, I saw it.
you're not the only one.
my Dad's been getting reports at the station.
like five hikers been killed by some bear.
but they can't find the bear.
