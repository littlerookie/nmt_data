ekman opted to be honest and tell her about his past right away.
ekman shares his knowledge with law enforcement and intelligence agencies to help them better detect suspicious behaviors or deceptions, such as a millisecond-long look of fear expressed by someone approaching an airport security check.

Ekman's research in the 1960s provided evidence that at least some facial expressions are universal; that is, certain facial expressions signify the same emotion in any culture anywhere in the world.
Ekman's specialty is the study of emotions and their relation to facial expressions, and his work formed the basis of the techniques used by fictional psychologist cal lightman inlie to me.
