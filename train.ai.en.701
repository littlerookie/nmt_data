jpm also says that clsa's research-focused platform does not really complement citic's underwriting capability.
jpm emerging markets local currency debt fund.
jpm may be the nation's largest bank and it may have weathered the financial crisis better than others, but that does not make it immune to the reality it is facing now, and action is imperative.
jpm would offer simple hedging instruments.
jpmorgan (jpm) could build that, and still have an additional$ 2 billion to work on larry page's and sergey brin's space elevator.
jpmorgan (jpm) earned$ 5.4 billion in the first three months of the year, driven in part by lower interest rates that produced hundreds of millions of dollars of excess profits in its mortgage division.
jpmorgan (jpm) has long been undervalued relative to its peers, trading currently in the range of 8.3 times forward p/ e versus 10.2 or more for other large banks like bank of america (bac) and well fargo (wfc), despite its record profits.
jpmorgan (jpm) paid$ 22 billion in penalties this year, including the largest single corporate fine in u.s. history.
jpmorgan added$ 2.2 billion to the money it puts aside to pay for future litigation expenses.
jpmorgan also disclosed that it recently received two "wells" notices from the securities and exchange commission related to its mortgage business.
jpmorgan also faces regulatory investigation into the losses incurred by one of its traders this year.
jpmorgan and bofa are very different banks.
jpmorgan and citigroup declined to comment.
jpmorgan and other banks change their models all the time.
jpmorgan and other wall street banks believe they will be allowed to keep those higher-risk activities, provided they do not invest their own money in the funds.
jpmorgan and wells fargo kicked off bank earnings season friday morning reporting some less-than-stellar results.
jpmorgan cazenove's high return on equity is deceptive: it leverages mr dimon's monster balance sheet while committing little capital of its own to its securities and underwriting business.
jpmorgan chase (jpm) and wells fargo (wfc) both reported earnings on friday that were better than analysts had expected.
jpmorgan chase (jpm) could be headed for the tub.
jpmorgan chase (jpm), wells fargo (wfc), and bank of america (bac) have all reported better-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter.
jpmorgan chase alone could have to stump up$ 2.6 billion, according to creditsights, a research firm.
jpmorgan chase and citibank were among companies that had to admit that customer lists had been stolen from epsilon, a company they used for e-mail marketing campaigns.
jpmorgan chase argues that the minimum standards will make it hold 45% more capital than it did during the crisis, obviating the need for extra padding.
jpmorgan chase claims its campaign was not marketing, but simply an attempt to manage its existing corporate philanthropy more imaginatively.
jpmorgan chase has said that fully one-third of its investment-banking profits came from otc derivatives in 2006-2008.
