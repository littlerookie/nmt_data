spielberg and Lucas.
spielberg gave great credit to the irish army who helped re-create the omaha beach scenes.
spielberg go and get some automatic rifles!
spielberg has a unique influence on the film industry.
spielberg insisted the performers feel free to alert him if a line felt wrong to them. Woody allen, on the set of midnight in paris, would sometimes idly instruct his actors to come into a room and "say something."
spielberg revitalizes classic sci-fi thriller war of the worlds.
spielberg would face a hefty tax bill if he decides to exercise the put option on the consulting fee, and the superstar director said he had no intention of doing so.
spielberg's early sci-fi and adventure films sometimes centering on children, were seen as an archetype of modern hollywood blockbuster filmmaking.
spielberg's most important contribution to modern movies is his insight that there was an enormous audience to be created if old-style b-movie stories were made with a-level craftsmanship and enhanced with the latest developments in special effects.
spielberg's pad is down that way.
Spielberg.
