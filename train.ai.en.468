rometty depends on it to inform strategy, and each year grades past gtos for their success in predicting trends.
rometty has indicated she will build on the strategies set down by her predecessors, although she is willing to put a bold stamp on the company if that's what it needs.
rometty is a senior vice president at ibm, as well as the head of sales and the new head of marketing and strategy.
rometty is no exception: she came to big blue as a systems engineer in 1981 after graduating from northwestern with a degree in computer science and electrical engineering at northwestern and doing a two year stint at the general motors institute (a condition of her college scholarship).
rometty was at palmisano's side for much of his decade-long tenure, and became a serious candidate to succeed him about four years ago.
rometty's two predecessors also are unlikely to have hosted a sales meeting in a loft, and they definitely wouldn't have described the proceedings as "neat."
