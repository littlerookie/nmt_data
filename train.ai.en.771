they think Juma's using some kind of jamming equipment.
they've also got spotters at every possible angle around the building, but they haven't been ae to see inside.
we still don't know whether Juma has the president, or whether the president is lked inside the safe room?
no, sir, we don't.
I will not authorize any action until I know the status of the president.
relay that to agent Moss.
Yes, sir.
mom, I know that I hurt you.
I'm so sorry for cutting you out of my life.
it's okay... - no, it isn't.
you were right to fire me off e campaign.
I felt so betrayed, I turned my back on you.
Olivia, don't worry about it.
it all seems so stupid now.
I hope you can forgive me.
darling, I forgave you a long time ago.
Livy, you have to listen to me.
we really are going to be okay.
just keep your eyes open and be ready.
no, no. - Get up.
leave her alone! Get away from her!
get back!
I said leave her alone! Please!
Olivia, it's okay, darling. It's okay!
bill, we need to make a move to try to save the president.
how?
in the lockdown room, there were five canisters of ch-4.
before we surrendered ourselves over to juma, I opened the valves.
within the next few minutes, that room is going to be saturated with natural gas.
it's going to take one spark to set it off.
I think the explosion is going to be large enough to take out most of Juma's men.
that's when you can make your move how do we set it off?
I'll me a run for the lockdown room. Try and draw their fire.
all we need is one stray bullet.
that's a suicide play, Jack.
we don't have a choice.
just make sure you can get to the president and get her out of here.
she knows about the plan; she'll be read what are you planning? Are you going to do something?
when it happens, you'll know about it, senator.
damn it, if you're planning something, I want to know what it is.
senator, shut up.
read this statement.
it is a confession of your crimes against my country.
the atrocities that you have committed will now be seen by the whole world.
I'll read your statement, general, but I need you to release the other hostages.
you got what you came for. You have the president of the united states.
as a sign of good faith...
I will release one of the hostages.
you... stand up.
do you want me to release any more hostages, president Taylor?
you son of a bitch.
you will read this statement or I will do the same thing to everyone here...
starting with your daughter.
general, the uplink is complete.
all right.
the world is waiting, madam president.
this is theresident of the united states.
six hours ago, I ordered our armed forces "to invade Sangala without warning and without provocation.
this attack was a cminal act motivated solely "by America's desire "to exert its power and influence.
tell me you're shutting this down.
we can't, sir. It's a live feed straight to the internet.
I don't care. Shut it down.
it's going out on multiple servers, sir.
it would take hours just to trace them.
this is Derek Watt hold on.
sir, it's agent Moss on teleconference. - Put him on.
sir, are you getting this? - Yes.
so is the rest of theamn world.
Mr. Vice president, I believe Juma came here to humiliate the president and stage a public execution.
we have a rescue operation in place. All we need is your authorization.
you don't know what Juma's intentions are.
this could be a prelude to a set of demands.
there are no demands here, sir. This is about revenge.
Juma knows he'll never get out of the white house alive.
you're speculating, agent Moss.
my advisorare telling me the most prudent course of action is to try to initiate communication with Juma.
we've been trying to do that. He hasn't responded.
sir, Juma has no desire to negotiate anything.
hes going to kill the president.
sir, we have a tactical plan in place.
it's a two-pronged assault, and we're confident that it stands a good chance of catching Juma off guard, but we're losing time. We have to initiate now.
I can not authorize any action at might result in the president's death.
keep trying to open dialogue with Juma.
hold your position till you're told otherwise.
I will keep this feed open.
general Juma has demonstrated "that even a tyrant state like the U. S...
be ready.
Jack, listen to me.
Juma's not solely coordinating this attack.
what do you mean?
I heard him talking on his sat phone.
he's coordinating with someone on the outside. They were giving him real-time intel.
you think it's someone in the white house?
I don't know.
but even if we take Juma down, the president may still be in danger.
you're the only one I know who can do this, Jack.
find out who Juma's working with.
agent Moss, a device has been detonated in the west wing.
Mr. Vice president, there's been an explosion at the white house.
an explosion? - Yes, sir.
the president's internet feed has gone dark.
we saw that. What's happening?
I don't know, sir, but we're going in under my authority. Let's go.
that is not your decision. - All teams, attack plan delta.
agent Moss, you're under orders! Agent Moss!
code green.
go, go, go, go!
Pierce, get to the president!
madam president, are you okay?
we need get out of here right now. Both of you, me with me. Let's go. This way.
madam president, get down.
stay low till I know we're clear.
kill the hostages. The president is mine!
no, no, no, no!
don't move! Don't you move!
clear. We're clear!
secret service! I ve the president!
aaron Pierce, secret service. Let's go, ma'am.
madam president, this way!
we have the president. The president is secure!
repeat: We have the president. This way, ma'am.
Renee! We gotta get the president out of here now! This way, ma'am.
it's all right, darling. It's gonna be all right.
madam president...
we're still sweeping the west wing.
but we do believe all the hostiles have been accounted for.
now you and your daughter will stay here until we finish securing the building.
I understand.
now once we get the all clear, we're going to move you to andrews air force base.
no, I'm staying right here.
ma'am, it's for your own safety.
do what's necessary to make sure this building's safe because I'm not going anywhere.
the American people need to know that the president is in the white house.
Yes, madam president.
how many people did we lose?
it's too early to tell.
medical teams are on their way to treat the wounded.
we're going to set up a triage unit in the east wing.
all right.
I'd like to speak to the vice president as soon as possible.
Yes, ma'am.
and I need to know how my husband's doing.
would you please contact Dr. Lee Schulman at west Arlington hospital?
Yes, madam president. - Thank you.
how's agent Pierce?
they said he's gonna be okay.
what about you?
I'm not sure.
I still can't believe this happened.
I thought they were gonna kill all of us.
I was so scared.
it's over... and we're safe...
thanks to a lot of brave people.
excuse me, madam president, the vice president is on a secure line.
I'll be right there.
did you mean what you said about putting the past behind us?
of course I meant it.
I don't ever want to lose you again.
you won't.
the president's safe, Jack. She's in the residence. She's secure.
I am so sorry, Jack.
I know that he wasour friend.
it was supposed to be me.
I was supposed to set off the explosion so that he could secure the president.
he died protecting his country.
Yeah.
this isn't over yet. Agent Moss...
Juma and his men were not working alone.
what are you talking about?
when I was in the lockdown with the president, bill said he heard juma talking on a sat phone.
said he was getting real-time intel from someone on the ouide.
who? - I don't know.
the point is, I don't think this threat is over, and I don't think the president is safe.
you sure buchanan heard this right?
and right now the only lead we've got is Ryan Burnett.
he knew about the attack on the white house, and chances are, he's gonna know who Juma was talking to.
all right, all right, I'll talk to him.
no, the president already offered him immunity. He turned it down.
he's not gonna tell you anything, but he will talk to me.
why is that, Jack, 'cause you tortured him?
I don't need to touch him. I just need him to think I'm there to finish what I started.
and I promise you he will tell us everything we need to know.
Larry, please, the last thing bill asked for before he died was for me to follow this through.
I owe him that.
look, I give you my word. I will not touch Burnett.
Jack, look, I understand about your friend, I do, but I got standing orders from the president to take you into custody.
I gotta get you back to FBI, but I promise you I'll look into this, all right?
agent Powell, handcuff Mr. Bauer.
take him down to staging area B.
sir, put your hands on top of your head.
if you're gonna tell me he's right about this I don't want to hear it.
Yes, that's the problem. You're not listening to what he's saying.
when are you gonna stop defending this guy?
I'm not defending him, I'm defending a good idea.
I just said I will look into this!
now do your job: Finish locking down the building.
agent Reynolds.
I need to speak with the president. It's urgent.
she's in a secure location. You'll need to go through Ethan Kanin.
where is he? - He just arrived.
he's on his way to see the president. - Thanks.
the president's in the residence with her daughter.
they've both been checked over and they're in good condition.
thank god.
I want a conference with the secnav and the joint chiefs as soon as possible.
we're routing all white housecommunications to the residence, and we're setting up a temporary command post.
good.
Mr. Kanin, I need to speak with you.
I'm on my way to see the president.
Yes, I know, sir, but it's extremely urgent. It'll only take a few moments.
all right. What is it, agent Walker?
some new intel has jus come to our attention and we need to act on it immediately.
I tried to reach the president, but I couldn't get through.
I'm listening.
sir, the threat to the president may not be over.
we've reason to believe that general Juma was not acting alone.
before Bill Buchanan died, he saw general Juma communicating with someone on a sat phone.
at this point, we can confirm that fbi ages entered the white house ments ago, and there were reports of sustained gunfire.
it appears that authorits are now in control of the west wing, and we are expecting word from our fbi source of the status of the hostages.
while there has been no official comment...
so what have we got?
the president's alive.
are you sure?
we've been monitoring interagency servers. Word just went out.
Juma's dead, Taylor survived.
what happened do you think?
we don't know any details yet, but we'll keep monitorg.
well...
you gotta admire the damn bitch.
she doesn't give up easily.
I'm sorry, sir. We, uh, just didn't have enough control over the situation.
Greg, you look tense.
do me a favor.
have a drink, relax.
Juma held up his part of the bargain.
we're getting what we wanted. As far as I'm concerned, everything's still on track.
where are the weapons now?
a shipment should ready for pickup in the next couple of hours.
good. Get Chapman on the phone.
I want to nail down some targets.
sir, the chopper you requested is on its way.
it'll be here in ten minutes. You'll be escorting Mr. Bauer back to FBI.
hold him in the command center. - Yes, sir.
this is Larry Moss. - This is Ethan Kanin.
I understand you're taking Jack Bauer back to FBI?
Yes, sir. He's gonna be debriefed and remanded into federal custody.
I want you to put that on hold. - Sir?
I just spoke with agent Walker.
she told me Juma may have been working with someone on the outside, and that there may be an ongoing threat to the president.
Yes, that's true.
I want you to send Jack Bauer to question Ryan Burnett.
agent Moss?
sir, I think that's a mistake.
Yes, agent Walker shared your concerns with me, and I've given this some thought.
if Burnett does know who Juma was working with, Bauer's approval may be our best chance to get that information.
with respect, sir, Bauer almost killed this man.
I was there, agent Moss, but this will be a controlled interrogation.
we're gonna play on Burnett's fears.
Bauer's presence alone should be enough to intimidate him into talking.
sir, Bauer is a ld card.
we have no idea what he'll do when he gets in that room with Burnett.
I realize there's a risk.
that's why you're going to do this under my authority and my authority alone.
you're not taking this to the president?
no. If something does go wrong, I want to make sure the president is protected.
with respect, sir, I think you're not telling the president 'cause you know she'd never allow this.
you've made your objections clear, agent Moss.
I'm not going to debate this with U.
I want you to take Bauer to question Burnett. That's a direct order. Do you understand?
I understand.
and I'm counting on you to supervise every second of that interrogation.
I'll expect a full report as soon as you're done.
Yes, sir.
I want tspeak personally to the famies of everyone we lost tonight, so...
EP me informed as they're notified.
absolutely, madam president.
and the minute Angela Nelson gets here, send her straight up to me.
we need to start working on the speech to the country.
of course, madam president.
Patrick, you have just been through a terrible ordeal.
are you sure you're okay?
I'll be fine.
it helps to focus on work.
I understand.
thank you, Patrick.
thank god you're all right.
how you feeling?
like I just woke up from a nightmare. It was unbelievable, Ethan.
I can't even imagine it. How's Olivia?
she's shaken up, but she's going to be okay.
I'm glad to hear it.
we lost some good people tonight, Ethan.
we're going to need all the help we can get.
I'm thinking about bringing olivia on as a special advisor.
madam president, I can understand your not wanting to be separated from your daughter after what's happened.
especially after what's happened, we need people who can do theob.
I'm not disputing Olivia's competence, but she's also a political liability.
nobody's forgotten what she did during the campaign, leaking damaging personal information about your opponent to the press.
oliva knows what she did was wrong.
she almost cost you the election.
she's changed.
we talked about it, Ethan, and she is accepting full responsibility.
she has learned from her mistakes.
I'm willing to put the past behind us so we can move ahead.
I still think it's a mistake.
I don't care what you think!
I am so sorry, Ethan.
you know I don't mean that.
but I've made up my mind.
I want Olivia to join my administration.
and I want it to come from you.
me?
your offering her this position would be a good way to extend an olive branch.
I need the two of you to make peace.
all right, madam president.
I'll talk to her.
thank you, Ethan.
I understand agent Walker was trying to reach me.
that's right, but I spoke to her.
what did she want?
just some procedural matters, madam president. I took care of it.
Larry, you wanted to see me?
I just got off the phone with Ethan Kanin.
look, I didn't want to go behind your back, but you didn't leave me any choice.
I didn't leave you a...
how about you choose to follow orders?
I'm sorry, Larry. - No. I don't think you are.
Larry, I've seen Jack do some terrible things today.
things that I still can't justify.
but he has been right every time. And you know what?
I can't help but think that maybe if we had just stayed out of his way, none of this would have happened.
look, I am sorry that I went behind your back, but I...
I promise you this play with Burnett will go down just the way jack says.
if you think you're going with Bauer, you are out of your mind.
you may have gotten a white house order, but I'm still running this operation.
I'll take bauer to see Burnett. You're going back to FBI.
I want you to clean out your office and hand in your badge.
I'm suspending you indefinitely.
okay. I know that you're upset Larry, but this isn't over.
you're going to need me.
what I need are people that I can trust. I thought that was you.
look, you may think you got what you wanted, getting Renee to go behind my back, but Ethan Kanin ordered me to l you question Burnett.
I'm going to be watching you every second you're in there.
you do one thing I don't like, you're finished. You understand me?
understood.
you shld leave Renee out of this.
she was just doing what she thoht was right.
yeah? Well, she may lose her job over it.
she's the best agent you've got.
she circumvented my authority. I can't just ignore that.
I've known this woman for nine years, and I've never seen her do the kind of things she's done in the last nine hours.
we've narrowed the list down to 12 targets along the eastern seaboard.
they're all within 300 kilometers of the base.
how many people?
10, 000 to 15, 000 in each target zone.
and our kill ratio would be what?
well, we've chosen these areas for maximum population density, so the ratio could be as high as 80%.
let's hope we never have to find out.
get these coordinates down to the boys in tac-ops.
have them start programming them in.
Yes, sir.
we just intercepted a flash memo from the FBI.
Jack Bauer is on his way to Kennedy memorial hospital to question Burnett.
Bauer was arrested. How is this possible?
there was an executive order from the white house giving Bauer access to Burnett.
Bauer will finish what he started. Burnett will tell him everything.
no, he won't, sir.
I have alreadyent somebody to the hospital to deal with Burnett.
he can take care of Bauer at the same time.
who did you send? - Quinn.
Quinn's good. Bauer's good, too.
agent Moss, we've locked down the entire floor.
we equipped Burnett's room with two cameras and audio surveillance.
where is he?
down the hall. It's going to be a moment. Doctor has to revive him.
Why? What happened?
he was given a heavy sedative. He was in pretty bad shape when he got here.
Dr. Wyndam, special agent larry moss, Jack Bauer.
I understand youe here to interrogate my patient.
that's right.
well, he's still recovering from his last interrogation, so if you're here to brutalize him again, I won't be party to it.
doctor, your patient was involved in a terrorist attack against the wte house in an effort to kill the president of the united states, and I believe the people he's working with want to try it again, so if you've got a problem...
we won't harm him, doctor.
this will be a controlled interrogation. Please, we need your cooperation.
it's going to take him a couple of minutes to come out of it.
who are you?
I'm a friend. What's your name?
Yeah. - You're recovering from heart surgery?
Yeah.
do you have a wife, Robert?
no. She passed away.
children? Grandchildren? - No.
what abouthis man? Does he have family?
Yeah. Lots of grandkids.
make a hell of a noise when they visit.
how's your arm?
I should be back on my feet in a couple of hours.
and you, ma'am?
Oh, it's nothing a little aspirin won't take care of.
I want to thank you for what you did.
you took a bullet for me. You saved my life.
there is no need to thank me, ma'am.
right, you were just doing your job.
only in this case, it wasn't really your job since you retired four years ago.
Yes, ma'am, that's true.
do you mind if I ask you why?
did it have to do with Martha Logan?
Martha and I were... close.
it must have been hard for you-- what happened to her.
I'd prefer not to talk about it.
I'm sorry.
you don't have to apologize.
I hope you won't be a stranger, agent Pierce.
thank you.
and, uh... it's Aaron.
okay, Aaron. You get some rest.
I'd like to head back to the residence now if that's okay?
Olivia... I was just coming to see you.
I'm glad you're all right.
thank you.
you have a moment to talk?
sure.
the blunt fact of the matter is...
this administration has just suffered some terrible losses, and we need help.
the president and I would like you to consider coming on board as special advisor to the president.
I, uh...
I have to say I'm a little surprised.
surprised? - Oh, that you'd sign off on this.
you mother said she's ready to put the past behind her...
and so am I.
I overstepped my bounds during the campaign, and I was wrong.
I'm glad you see it that way.
but it's not the past that concerns me, ethan.
it's what's happening right now, and what's been happening ever since my mother took office.
excuse me?
do you think any of this would have happened if my mother had a chief advisor who knew what the hell was going on in her administration?
what are you talking about?
every government was corrupted on every level, and it all happened right under your nose.
even you have to admit, it's an unconscionable failure on your part.
frankly, I'm surprised you haven't tendered your resignation.
you have no right to speak to me that way.
you don't know what you're talking abo.
you don't have the facts.
I intend to get the facts.
I'm going to find out exactly who failed my mother, and I am going to make sure that that person never is in a position to do it again.
excuse me.
okay, let's go.
I'll be watching. You lay one finger on him, it's over.
right.
he's coming around. - Good.
wake up.
wake up.
remember me?
Oh, my god.
what the hell are you doing here?
I've juscome from the white house.
Juma's attack failed.
he's dead, and so are his men.
a lot of innocent people died today. Good people.
including a friend of mine-- Bill Buchanan. You might have met him.
you stay the hell away from me.
and I want to talk to a lawyer right now.
do you hear me? I want to talk to a lawyer!
somebody get me the hell out of here!
you're not going anywhere. It's just you and me, pal.
did you really think you were going to get away with it?
somebody please, help me!
you're wasting your breath. Th're not coming for you.
please don't hurt me. I'll tell you anything you want.
do you hear that-- I'm ready to talk. I'll tell you anything you want to know!
just get him out of here! I'm ready to talk!
they're done talking to you. That's why they sent me.
please, you can't do this! You have no right! This isn't legal!
what happened? - I don't know.
looks like we lost the sound feed. Give me a second.
there are no laws in here, Mr. Burnett.
you aided and abetd terrorists, who then tried to kill the president of the united states.
now you have to answer for that.
the rules don't apply to you anymore.
no, please, please, you can't let him touch me!
please, you can't let him do this... - Shut up!
it could be a glitch in the trunk line.
damn it, fix the thing!
I'm trying, sir.
Bauer? - He jammed the electronic bolt.
is there another way in? - No.
damn it, Bauer, open the door!
have security lock down the hospital.
I want a high-priority apb issued for Jack Bauer.
all agencies.
it's done. - Good. Thank you.
it's done. Burnett's dead.
and Bauer?
They'lthink he killed Burnett.
so, nobody will know that we were involved.
good. - Yeah.
now 're having some fun.
agent Moss.
Larry, it's Jack. Listen to me.
where are you?
I didn't kill Burnett. I'm being set up.
set up?
a man released some kind of rve agent into the room.
it immobilized me. He came through the ceiling and killed Burnett.
I swear to you, I'm not lying. I watched him do it.
get back in here, we'll work this out.
I can't, you know that.
you can if you're innocent.
look, there is a reason why they wanted me framed and didn't kill me.
they're trying to keep you distracted by dealing with m so they n finish what they started.
don't let them get away with this. This threat is not over.
damn it!
Livy, it could take weeks to find Ethan's replacement.
in the meantime, I'm going to need a provisional chief of staff.
I would like that to be you.
I have Larry Moss calling for you.
mam, we have evidence Juma allowed Starkwood to use Sangala as a base to manufacture biological weapons.
are you saying these weapons are on us soil?
we suspect they're at the Starkwood headquarters in Virginia.
and you're not suggesting that Starkwood intends to use those weapons to attack this country?
given their actions today, we need to move on Starkwood immediately.
they're coming and they'll be coming with everything they've got and the only thing that's going to stop them is getting these weapons ready to deploy.
tell me what the FBI knows.
I don't know anything, Mr. Hodges.
get him out of here and do what you have to do.
I'm not spending the rest of my life in prison because Jonas Hodges has lost his mind.
you know where the weapons are? - Yes.
Where's Jack?
he managed to secure the weapons, but starkwood got him back.
Jack was exposed.
there has to be something that you can do to help him.
there's no cure.
we got a location on the weapon.
we're getting ready to stage a raid on the compound.
I want to go.
I'm sorry. I can't allow it.
I'm the only one who's seen the canisters. I know exactly what we're looking for.
but you're sick.
we have no idea when you're going to start showing symptoms.
you're right.
where are the damn weapons?
he played me.
little old Seaton bought us some time.
we're going to do a point by point search of this entire compound.
there are biological weapons on this facility.
we're not going anywhere without them.
you try to advance any farther, you will be fired upon.
I count three platns at least.
everything mil-spec.
Yeah. They were waiting for us.
this was one big trap.
Renee, we would really use those satellite overheads.
copy, Larry. What have we got?
nothing. The subnet's been crashing.
okay, wait, wait, wait. Re we go.
I've got sat five retasking now...
somebody talk to me. What are you seeing?
Larry, you've got hostiles on all sides.
damn it. Find me an opening.
I'm looking, but there's no way through.
okay, heads up. Is everybody seeing this? Larry?
Yeah. Yeah. We're seeing it.
it's hodges.
the men are at the ready, Sir.
I appreciate your presence.
where else would I be?
who's in charge here? - I am.
agent Moss.
you need to move your men and allow us to proceed.
I want you off our property and I want you to release my man.
you have no right to take him hostage.
I have an order from the president of the United States.
to search this building.
for weapons that do not exist.
have you looked?
are there weapons of mass destruction? Are there weapons of any kind?
is there anything in here at all?
agent Moss, who dreamed up this charade?
give me a name.
let's get to the bottom of this.
you want to talk to me, Mr. Hodges?
get these guns off my head.
you think you have a gun at your head?
you know what I've got?
I've got the United States government sending swat teams and attack helicopters in the middle of the night.
I've got a government that I served faithfully for 30 years dreaming up bs accusations so politicians too cowardly to show their faces can dismantle my company.
that's what I've got.
you've got five minutes to get these helicopters flying out of here with all of you on board.
you don't want to do this.
five minutes.
and I want my man back.
Renee, you get that? - Yeah, we did.
and what options do we have? - In five minutes?
I know there's no time to bring in more tac support, so give me something else.
all right, Larry, give me a second. Stand by.
that's it.
I want to show you something.
Hodges just gave us five minutes to clear the base.
we lost that situation. We were out maneuvered but I think I found us a new way in.
look. These are senator mayer's files. This is Douglas Knowles.
he's the chairman of Starkwood.
he was actually helping the senator with the investigation.
he is the one who brokered the deal to open the company's books.
what, another insider? Didn't we just get burned?
just listen.
knowles was loyal to Hodges for almost 20 years and now he's secretly helping the senator take down starkwood?
he's scared of something. This man wants to help us.
it's worth a shot.
Yeah. Make the call.
Knowles. - Mr. Knowles, my name is Jack Bauer.
I got your number from senator Mayer.
senator mayer is dead.
Yes, Sir, I know. I was with him when he was killed by one of your employees.
a man named John Quinn.
you have no idea how much I was hoping someone would call.
I'm sorry, Sir. I don't understand.
things are very out of control.
are you aware of what's happening on your base?
I'm watching it with my own eyes.
the FBI is pinned down. They say they're looking for bioweapons.
Sir,Jonas Hodges is in possession of a military-grade bioweapon.
a prion variant developed in Africa with general Juma.
well, it's not where they think it is.
they're all standing in front of an empty hangar.
the FBI was deliberately led to the wrong location by a man named seaton, but I promise you, Sir, the weapon is on your base.
I was contaminated when trying to intercept the canisters.
they were ferried back to starkwood approximately 90 minutes ago.
90 minutes ago Jonas was handing down his new strategy to the board.
stonewall the government, no cooperation whatsoever.
I can't believe this is happening.
sir, this is happening and I promise you the weapons are on your base.
do you have any idea where they might be?
I think I might.
Mr. Knowles, I want to put you in touch with one of my men in the field.
can I call you right back? - Yes.
thank you. Go.
some of the men were unhappy drawing down on federal agents.
it's understandable.
I had hoped not to include the rank and file.
you can count on them.
let's show our guests the door.
let's move!
into position.
Jack, I'm on comm.
you're on with me and agent walker.
Hodges' men have repositioned themselves.
okay, we're going to have to move fast.
Larry, I want you and your men to pull out on Hodges' timetable.
Tony, you're going to need to find a way to stay behind.
we're going to get your vectors over to a man that we contacted inside starkwood.
his name is Douglas Knowles. He believes he knows where the weapons are.
isn't this how we got into this mess?
Almeida and some supposedly friendly contact?
knowles is chairman of the starkwood board, but he was cooperating with senator mayer's investigation of the company.
Larry, he is all that we've got.
all right, I got 400 eyeballs trained on me right now.
how the hell are we supposed to get almeida to stay behind?
Larry, I need you and your men to create a diversion to cover tony's escape.
look, we need to make this work.
if you all get on those helicopters together, we are going to lose this weapon for good.
Larry, are you on board with this?
we got to go.
Larry, we need to know, are you on board?
I'll do what I can.
take his bag.
all right, let's go. We're standing down. You're coming with me.
Hey, wait a minute. This wasn't part of the deal.
what deal? As far as I could tell, he couldn't care about you one way or the other.
you take these handcuffs off of me or it's going to get really ugly.
soldier!
get the hell out of here, Moss.
you don't want to test us.
let's go!
don't move. No!
Doug knowles. Jack bauer sent me. Come on.
that street's solid security cameras.
I'll take you to a restricted area.
it's on the east perimeter.
there's a good chance the weapons are there.
the place is crawling. I don't know how we're going to make it.
I'll take care of that.
Jack, I'm with knowles.
I'm going to need satellite support on the east perimeter.
Jack, I need support. Do you copy?
- Copy,tony.
I've got you just off the landing pad. No hostiles in your immediate vicinity.
proceed at your own discretion.
copy that. Which way?
come on.
Jack. You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Tony and knowles have connected. We're good.
it's time to call the white house with an update.
okay, good. I'll be right there.
madam President, excuse the interruption.
Jack Bauer is on line seven.
Mr. Bauer, tell me you have the bioweapon.
madam President, I'm afraid that's not the case.
our search was stopped by armed mercenaries on starkwood's base.
agent Moss and his men were forced to withdraw from a firefight they most certainly would have lost.
are you saying Hodges men were ready to fire on federal agents?
Yes, ma'am, that's correct.
my god! Who does he think he is? !
madam President, despite the setback, I am confident the weapons are still there.
I reached out to starkwood's chairman.
he's willing to cooperate. He's with Tony Alameida now.
they are moving towards a secure area on the base where we believe the weapons are being held.
very good. Tim, what's our troop status?
mobilizing. The secretary of defense says they're still several hours out.
at which point we have a war on our hands against 1, 500 mercenaries armed with bioweapons.
madam President, I do believe that a surgical air strike will work as long as we can pinpoint the exact location of the weapon.
and you can do that? - Yes, I believe we can.
Mr. Bauer, you've seen the canisters containing the bioweapons, you know what they look like, is that correct?
Yes, ma'am.
then we'll need you to verify the canisters once almeida has located them.
no more mistakes.
we're gonna need visual confirmation from you, Bauer-- eyes on.
Jack, we have got to get this part right.
I understand. Anything else?
Jack, I have been told that you were exposed to the pathogen.
how you doing?
right now I'fine, madam President. Thank you for asking.
thank you for your service.
I'm not giving up on you. Keep me informed.
Yes, ma'am. Let's go.
I don't have a lot of time. What's going on?
that's what I've been trying to ask you. I called three times.
it's kind of crazy here right now.
unless it's urgent, I gotta call you back.
I'm hearing rumors that the joint chiefs have been called in.
it's not a big deal.
they're just doing a final assessment before lowering the alert level.
Olivia, don't do this.
what? I'm telling you the truth. - Really?
because I've got a source in the port authority container yard who's using terms like "weapons of mass destruction,
so naturally I'm wondering if that's why the joint chiefs are having a meeting.
look, I can't talk about it.
it's obviously a question of national security.
but you have my word I'll tell you soon as I can.
I want to know now.
I just gave you a big story, ken. You'll have to wait. I gotta go.
don't hang up on me, olivia.
that'd be a big mistake.
what's that supposed to mean?
you want me to say it, fine, I'll say it.
think how your mother would feel when she hears that you forced out her chief of staff so you could take over his position.
he was incompetent.
Yeah, well, it won't play that way on the morning news.
so, talk to me. Now.
I can't talk here.
I'm in the Roosevelt Continental, room 1271.
you've got half an hour.
agent Pierce, please get a car ready.
I have to make a quick run.
all right, Jack, we're here.
knowles says there's been increased activity in this area for several days now.
I'm looking at about a half a dozen buildings.
could be any one of them. - Copy that, Tony.
hold on, we're getting infrared up now.
I'm counting seven buildings in your immediate vicinity.
the building directly southeast of your current position is showing no infrared signal.
I'm guessing they're using a blackout shield.
all right, we'll try there first.
you see any patrols coming our way?
negative, you're clear.
okay, let's go.
Jack, Knowles' key card isn't working.
we're gonna need electronic support here.
there should be an r-6 interface module on the back of your comm device.
it's a card key. - Yeah, I know what that is, thank you.
I'm plugging in now.
okay, we're up. Cormac z series.
we're looking at a five digit key protected by an aes block cipher.
running combinations.
okay, Tony, you've got a vehicle coming your way.
it's east of you about a hundred yards.
take cover down there.
how much longer? - How much more time do you need?
I only have two out of five digits.
we're pretty exposed here.
it's all right, I'm fine.
come on.
two more numbers, Tony.
what are we gonna do?
we still got two digits to go.
move in for a closer look.
we're not going to make it. - Sit tight.
Doug, where you-- Doug!
hold your position. May I see some id?
one to go.
I apologize, Mr. Knowles.
Mr. Hodges has ordered the base cleared of all nonessential personnel.
nonessential personnel? I'm chairman of the board.
I realize that, but we're dealing with a heightened security situation here.
so, I need to know what you were doing in this area.
Jonas called a late night board meeting, that's what I'm doing here.
sir, that meeting ended nearly two hours ago. - We got it; we're in.
I don't have to explain myself to you, younow.
I'm sorry, sir, but you do.
sir, I don't believe you're hearing me.
no, I don't you're hearing me!
look, I built this company! And I don't need you telling me where I can and cannot walk!
understood?
you're gonna have to come with me, Sir. Right this way.
I'm in. But they got Knowles.
do you think he's gonna say anything?
I don't know.
but I better get in and out as fast as possible just in case he does.
okay, Tony, the president needs a visual on the weapons before she'll launch an attack.
she needs your eyes on the canisters and a confirmation by Jack.
copy that.
I'm moving. - Good.
stay here, I'll be right back.
get me the medic!
Yes, Sir.
we just found Mr. Knowles alone just outside the restricted zone.
did he have an explanation?
Yes, Sir, he said he was walking.
walking.
should I take him to stokes for interrogation, sir?
you're suggesting what, soldier, that we strap him down, extract a confession, because he was walking?
he's the chairman of the board.
I was just requesting instructions, sir. What you'd like done.
I'd like you to take him to his office.
make sure he's comfortable. And stay with him until I arrive.
Yes, Sir. Will that be all?
call zone nine, have them double down security.
let's make sure that mr. Knowles was in fact alone.
Yes, Sir.
how much longer?
half an hour.
good.
I'll need to know the minute it's done.
Yes, Sir.
aaron, I'd like you to wait in the hall, if that's okay.
ms. Taylor, you tasked me with handling your security.
I can't allow you to enter a hotel room I haven't vetted.
aaron, I appreciate the concern.
but you can see the door from here, I have you on speed-dial, and I can scream very loudly when the occasion demands.
I just need two minutes to wrangle a reporter.
really, I'll be fine.
all right, I'll be here if you need me.
want a drink?
no.
I assume you don't mind if I do. It's been a day.
I gotta tell you.
I don't like being threatened.
it was unfortunate. I apologize.
we've known each other a long time, Ken.
I thought we had an understanding. - We do.
and I want to keep it that way.
we both do. Am I right?
okay, so, I told you, I have this source.
cop out at the port authority container yard.
okay.
he told me he saw these professional assassin types get into an intense firefight out there a couple hours ago.
according to him, someone hijacked a wmd out to god knows where.
that's true. - Yeah.
Yeah, I want to know all about it.
look, if you think all you've got to do is nod your head confirming what I already know, then we've got a problem.
it's national security, Ken. I can't tell you.
I'm saying you can.
if this story breaks, it would create a panic.
people would be hurt.
if you knew what it was, you'd understand why it's got to stay a secret.
right, exactly. I'd understand.
have a little faith, okay?
all right.
there is a bioweapon in the container yard.
that's what they were fighting over.
it was developed by Starkwood in Africa.
Starkwood? - Right.
they moved it to their base about 30 miles from here.
so it's there right now.
so this is what the joint chiefs are discussing, what to do about that.
the president ordered an air strike as soon as the exact location of the canisters was known.
so you see why you can't run with this?
really, Ken, you can't.
a lot of lives are at stake. The entire plan depends on surprise.
you get that, right?
maybe you're right. Maybe I need to kill this story.
thank you.
what I mean is maybe somebody could convince me.
what are you saying?
you know what I'm saying.
you're very beautiful when you get all patriotic. I ever tell you that?
that's over. We agreed. - You agreed.
really, I don't want to do this.
then say no.
this is pandopamine which should control the shaking.
here, apply pressure.
you can give yourself an injection once every two hours.
more if needed.
you think I'll need more?
in all likelihood, yes.
the onset of symptoms so soon after exposure suggests the bio-agent is more virulent than we thought.
all we're doing here is just masking the symptoms.
I understand.
there's something you may want to consider, though.
what's that?
Bryden university has been funding some studies on prion diseases.
the work is purely experimental at this point, but it does suggest treatment.
that's good news.
I don't want to get anyone's hopes up here.
we're talking a slight chance.
a possible treatment using stem cells from a genetically compatible donor.
an immediate family member would make the best donor candidate.
I saw your file. It says you have a daughter, right?
I don't want my daughter involved in this.
Jack, if there's a chance. - Mr. Bauer...
doctor, thank you for everything you've done.
excuse me. I need to get back to work.
this is none of your business.
it's my business when you're having a seizure in the middle of the FBI.
you heard the doctor. The medition will mask the symptoms.
why won't you even talk about this?
talk about what? - The experimental procedure.
because there's nothing to talk about.
she's your daughter, and you're not even gonna let her know?
that's right.
so you're just not even gonna try?
Renee, I know you're trying to help, but you don't know what you're talking about here.
my daughter and I, we don't talk, okay?
so, please, just let it go.
it should be her choice.
well, it's not.
I'm the one who's dying. It's my choice.
Noign of the target yet, but Tony's working on it.
you look better. - Thanks.
Tony, can you hear me?
Jack, you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
okay, tony, we're seeing new activity outside the building.
two vehicles, eight hostiles.
looks like a security detail.
you think Knowles gave him up?
Tony, they're moving straight for your point of entry.
eight hostiles and closing.
Yeah, I hear them. - You want to regroup?
no, I want to get this over with.
we're clear.
we're clear.
I haven't seen you here before.
they just sent eight of us over here, sir.
why, is something wrong?
no, sir. Just, you know, precautions.
right, right. Can't be paranoid enough.
I'm in the main building.
copy, we're with you.
Tony, it's Jack.
I've got you at 125 feet msl, approximately 40 feet underground. Is that correct?
that's right. I'm four floors down.
we've got no information on any kind of subterranean floors for that building.
believe me, they're here.
Epoxy-hardened walls, poured concrete ceilings.
I have a visual on the weapon.
sending images for verification now.
copy that.
okay, those are the canisters.
I'll notify admiral smith the target is located and confirmed.
Tony, those are the canisters.
Jack, it looks like they're transferring the pathogens from the canisters into some sort of delivery system.
it's on the move. - Copy that. It doesn't matter.
Renee's phoning in the coordinates. Everything's gonna be dust in the next ten minutes.
get out of there now. - Copy that. Withdrawing.
okay, men.
you want to explain this, Jonas?
I'm arrested by our own security force.
held captive in my own office like a prisoner.
they won't allow me a phone call, even to you, to find out what the hell is going on!
well, that's a lot of complaints, Doug. You done?
you were supposed to be home hours ago.
why'd they find you snooping around?
I saw the FBI raid.
they say we have bioweapons.
which they did not find.
that's not the point.
is it true?
remember when I first brought you out here 20 years ago?
there was nothing here. Nothing.
and out of the damn mud, we built this place, the largest private army in the hemisphere, maybe the world, and we pulled america's ass out of the fire again and again and again.
answer the question!
I am.
every day we've done things that the government itself could not or would not do.
get this done," that's what they said,"here's your mission.
nobody asked how anything was gonna be done.
nobody wanted to know.
all anyone wanted was results, and we delivered.
no one's questioning that.
no one's questioning that?
you're not insane, are you?
the senate, the committees, the president.
every chattering nonentity in washington is out there with their standard operating procedures saying,"how was this done? How was that done?
tearing at us, trying to bring us down, every one of them.
I kept this country strong. I kept it safe.
and I will not be persecuted for that.
Jonas, you cannot start a war against the people you're supposed to protect.
we were at war, Doug, the moment they decided to dismantle us.
and as for particular weapons, as for your question, let me rephrase it.
are we prepared to defend ourselves?
we are.
you can't take on the federal government.
Yeah, well, you never were one for thinking big.
20 years I treated you like a son.
20 years.
a little loyalty...
wasn't that the least I deserved?
Yes.
sir, we just got an alert from one of our radar intercepts.
there's a squadron of f-18's heading our way out of Virginia beach.
sir? - What's the eta?
less than ten minutes.
what's our readiness? - How many?
we have three loaded.
place the call to the president.
I'll be there momentarily.
you probably think I'm the scum of the earth right now.
all I care about is that you don't run the Starkwood story.
you're a real sport.
taking one for the team like this.
look at me.
you won't run it, right?
I'm sorry, Livy. - What?
I have to run it.
breaking something this big will put me over the top in New York.
I'll make sure nobody knows any of it came from you.
you lying son of a bitch.
come on, please.
I'm did what I needed to do to get ahead-- just like you.
there's no comparison.
running that story will harm the country.
I've been in Washington a lot longer than you.
you'll see, this is how the way the game is played.
actually, Ken, this is how the game is played.
what do you mean?
you run that story, or ever try to blackmail me again, and I'll make sure everyone knows just how you get your leads.
I think your wife will be especially interested.
from everything you've told me, that's gonna be one nasty divorce.
you bitch.
find a new beat, Ken.
I don't want to see you around the white house again.
sorry, I've got to take this.
where in the world are you?
I'm sorry. I had a meeting on k street.
I had to run interference with a reporter.
are the press on to this?
not anymore. I took care of it.
I need you here, Livy.
we've had confirmation on the bioweapons, and the air strike is happening now.
I'll be there in five minutes.
where are we, admiral?
the f-18's have been loaded with bunker-buster ordinance and will be in range in seven minutes.
what's the risk of the pathogen spreading to the surrounding areas?
minimal. We're using white phosphorous charges, which burn at 5, 000 degrees.
more than enough to incinerate the pathogen.
and that's been confirmed by the CDC.
it has.
weapons are ready?
Yes, Sir.
the call to the president?
the calls in process.
it's an historic day, gentlemen.
a great day for Starkwood.
too bad mr. Knowles can't be joining us.
weapons control status: Yellow tight.
fighters entering the ip. Engage airspace coordination area.
Roger that.
stand by.
madam President, command and control is reporting that a phased array radar system is active inside the starkwood compound.
meaning what exactly?
they know we're coming.
is there any evidence of an antiaircraft artillery threat?
intelligence is indicating no such capability on the ground.
madam President, there's a phone call for you. It's Jonas Hodges.
put him on speaker.
ma'am, he's requested a private conversation.
he says he's established a proprietary line in the ops room.
a proprietary line?
how did he manage that?
I have no idea.
hello.
madam president, let me begin by saying that I am truly sorry it's come to this.
at you turn your planes around immediately.
you're in no position to issue ultimatums, Mr. Hodges.
well, maybe I am.
you remember several years ago, madam president, Starkwood was deployed to pakistan.
Oh, I remember it very well. I fought that deployment.
and you lost.
you'll also recall that we requisitioned a missile system at that time
python fives.
well, three of those missiles are now loaded with the pathogen and aimed at cities on our eastern seaboard.
you're bluffing.
as a sign of good faith, I'm willing to show you that I'm not bluffing.
you see that? Madam President?
you call this good faith? You are waging war on your own country, Jonas.
well, of course, I wouldn't see it that way.
what do you want?
well, we can have that conversation a little later on at the white house.
you think we're going to just sit down and discuss this?
yes I do, in the oval office, in confidence, within the hour.
but in the meantime, I think it is to both of our advantage that the american people do not know the exact circumstance of this standoff.
so you will keep this conversation to yourself, and turn the planes around.
and if you don't comply, madam President,
I will have no choice but to launch those missiles.
Mr. Hodges and remember, I can detect any action you take against our facility.
you have 30 seconds.
Mr. Hodges... Mmr. Hodges!
abort the air strike, admiral Smith.
madam President, just do as I say.
ma'am, with all respect, damn it, admiral, abort the air strike immediately!
this is admiral Smith. I have an abort order from the president.
take fighters off target.
repeat: Take fighters off target.
stand by for confirmation code.
Roger that.
we're standing down, madam President.
Mr. Knowles, my name is jack bauer.
Jonas hodges is in possession of a military-grade bioweapon.
I was contaminated when trying to intercept the canisters.
I promise you, sir, the weapon is on your base.
do you have any idea where they might be?
think I might.
I have an order from the president of the united states.
to search this building.
are there weapons of mass destruction?
are there weapons of any kind?
you've got five minutes to get these helicopters flying out of here with all of you on board.
Larry, I want you and your men to pull out on hodges' timetable.
Tony, you're gonna need to find a way to stay behind.
we're gonna get your vectors over to a man that we contacted inside starkwood.
his name is douglas knowles. He believes he knows where the weapons are.
stay here. I'll be right back.
Jack! We need a medic!
the bioagent is more virulent than we thought.
all we're doing here is just masking the symptoms.
I understand.
there's something you may want to consider. - What's that?
a possible treatment using stem cells from a genetically compatible donor.
I saw your file, and it says you have a daughter.
I don't want my daughter involved in this.
Jack. It should be her choice.
well, it's not. I'm the one who's dying.
I'm in. But they got knowles.
a little loyalty.
wasn't that the least I deserved?
you can't take on the federal government.
I have a visual on the weapon.
okay, those are the canisters.
I'll notify admiral smith the target is located and confirmed.
you remember starkwood was deployed to pakistan, that we requisitioned a missile system at that time.
well, three of those missiles are now loaded with a pathogen and aimed at cities on our eastern seaboard.
you will keep this conversation to yourself and turn the planes around.
and if you do not comply, madam president,
I will have no choice but to launch those missiles.
abort the air strike, admiral smith.
ma'am, with all respect... - damn it, admiral.
abort the air strike immediately!
Tony, it's jack. Do you copy?
Jack, what the hell is going on?
where are those f-18s?
tim woods just called from the white house.
the president canceled the air strike.
what? Why?
she doesn't believe our intel is strong enough to justify military action.
is she out of her mind?
Jack, I saw those canisters with my own eyes.
so did you. They're in that bunker.
she's not gonna get any better intel than that.
I know. It doesn't make any sense, but right now, we've got a presidential order to pull you out of the starkwood compound, along with the perimeter teams.
Tony, larry's been told the president's decision.
he's preparing to move his teams out, but he's got to get you out of there first.
he'll be sending you coordinates for an exfiltration point along the southwest perimeter.
Tony? - Hold on a second.
Tony, what's going on?
Jack, I might know why the president called off that air strike.
what do you mean?
I think starkwood's got surface-to-surface missiles.
that's how they're gonna deploy the bioweapon.
how do you know this?
a fuel truck just pulled up next to the bunker where they're storing the weapons.
they're pumping rp-7 into an underground depot.
what's rp-7?
it's a propellant only used in surface-to-surface missiles. Tony, are you sure?
I'm looking right at it, jack.
do you have any c-4 on you?
Yeah, I've got three charges and a remote detonator.
do you think you can gain access to the underground fuel depot?
Yeah, I think we've got a play, but I've got to move soon...
before that fuel truck pulls away.
okay, I want you to maintain your position. I'm gonna call the president.
come with me.
what is it, tim?
madam president, the joint chiefs are beginning to question your decision to call off the air strike against starkwood.
they think the intelligence we received from tony almeida was sufficient and that we may be missing an opportunity to destroy the bioweapons.
I gave my orders, tim. No air strike.
no military action of any kind against starkwood.
now, I asked you to handle the joint chiefs; handle them.
I'll do my best, ma'am, but if I may...
what is our next move?
Jonas hodges is coming to the white house.
he wants to speak with me alone.
for what possible reason? - I don't know.
madam president, shouldn't your advisors be at that meeting?
Tim, stop asking me questions.
if you want to help, make sure as few people as possible know that jonas hodges is coming here.
and bring him in through the southeast service entrance.
yes?
madam president, jack bauer and renee walker are calling from fbi.
you did speak to fbi?
Yes, ma'am, five minutes ago. I gave them your reason for calling off the air strike, but I must warn you, they were skeptical as well.
be ready for hodges.
Mr. Bauer, agent walker, this is the president.
madam president, we need to talk.
no, mr. Bauer, we don'T. You need to listen.
I appreciate everything that you have done in gathering this intel, but I still need more before I can authorize an air strike. I'm sorry.
madam president, with all due respect, I don't believe you're being truthful with us.
excuse me?
I think you called off the air strike because jonas hodges is in possession of surface-to-surface missiles armed with the bioweapon, and he's threatening to use them in case you try to take action against him.
madam president, tony almeida witnessed a truck pumping rp-7 rocket fuel into an underground depot situated right next to the bunker where the bioweapons are being stored.
the only purpose for rp-7 rocket fuel is to launch missiles.
madam president, please just tell us the truth.
Jack, hodges has 13 python missiles armed with the bioweapons.
three are currently aimed at american cities.
he demanded that i recall the planes, or he would launch.
what does hodges want? - I don't know...
but he's requested a face-to-face meeting.
he'll be at the white house in a few minutes.
madam president, the only reason he wants a face-to-face meeting is to lay out his demands, and whatever they are, you cannot negotiate with him.
I'm not planning on negotiating with him, jack.
once he places his cards on the table, I am sure that I can...
I can make him realize the futility of what he is trying to do.
Jonas hodges is a traitor and a terrorist, and after everything that's happened today, are you really naive enough to believe that you can simply talk to him and change his mind?
I'm not new at this, jack, and right now, I don't have another option.
madam president, you do. Tony almeida is still inside starkwood.
I ordered him exfiltrated immediately.
what's he still doing there?
I asked him to stand by until I could talk to you.
he believes he can gain access to the fuel depot and lay a series of explosive charges and take the missiles out.
now, I believe this can work, but we need to act quickly.
what about the bioweapons?
rp-7 rocket fuel burns at 5, 000 degrees.
there will be nothing left.
once the weapons are destroyed, larry moss and his teams can move in on starkwood and lock it down.
Hodges gave standing orders to his men to launch the missiles at the first detection of government inrference.
if almeida is detected, thousands of americans will die, jack.
madam president, I know that there's a risk, but I would not be asking you to do this if I didn't think it would work.
please, I am begging you. Trust me.
how long did the doctors give you to live?
uh, they're not sure, but the pathogen has started to take effect.
then there's not much i can threaten you with, is there?
I expect you'll do what you think is right.
what the hell does that mean?
she wants us to go in.
but she didn't authorize it.
she can't. She needs this to be a covert operation.
if something were to go wrong and those missiles were to be launched, the president needs to be able to swear under oath that we were working on our own.
she wants us to go in. Notify larry. We need to move fast.
I told you I'd get you to the white house.
I just didn't think it would be under these conditions.
it was brilliant, you know.
what was that, sir?
what you did to make almeida think that you were betraying me.
quite brilliant. - Thank you, sir.
you put yourself in harm's way, greg, and I'll never forget that.
I can't believe... I'm feeling nervous.
you're gonna do fine, sir.
thank you, tim. - You're welcome.
so, it sounds to me like the president didn't actually authorize this.
technically, no. It was more of an...
an indirect order, but believe me, larry, she wants this to happen.
she's gonna meet with hodges, and we're gonna blow those fuel tanks.
Larry, do you have a problem with this?
as a matter of fact, no. None whatsoever.
these starkwood bastards drew on my men. I'm looking forward to getting back in there.
all right, have your teams hold their position and be ready to move.
believe me, you'll know when it happens. - All right.
Tony, it's jack. Do you copy? - Yeah, I'm here.
you were right about the missiles. The president confirmed it.
we're gonna have to carry this out as a covert operation.
Larry and his men are standing by to lock down starkwood as soon as the missiles have been destroyed.
good. - Tony...
I need to know that you can do this without being detected.
hodges's given his men standing orders to launch those missiles if there's a breach of any kind.
Yeah. I can do it.
okay. Good luck. - Yeah.
we're done here.
I'm going to go run a perimeter check.
you said you just finished one.
I know.
but I don't think we can be too careful right now.
Yeah. - it's me.
auxiliary tanks are fueled and ready.
confirmed. I'll be down in a few minutes.
copy that.
Freeze! Let me see your hands.
put your gun on the ground. Slowly.
kick it.
drag him under the truck. Now! Let's go!
hands up.
what do you think you're doing?
you're going to take me down to the fuel tanks.
let's go.
open it up.
go ahead.
president will see you now.
very good. Thank you.
Mr. Hodges.
madam president.
this is greg seaton, my associate.
he's a remarkable man. Doesn't look remarkle, but believe me, he's a genius.
Yes, I know mr. Seaton.
thank you, gentlemen.
it never gets old, does it?
stepping into the... the oval office.
almost smells of history.
can we sit? - Please.
you know, this is the first time I've been in this room since you were elected?
I'm aware of that, yes.
under your predecessor, I used to drop by every couple of months.
I'd brief president daniels on what was really going on in the world.
and you've been excluded now.
is that what this is about? - No, ma'am.
it's about allowing starkwood to fulfill the purpose for which it was founded:
protecting this country.
you have been attacking this country.
you and general juma have killed hundreds of innocent people, including my son.
madam president, I'm deeply sorry for your loss, and my heart breaks for all the lives that were taken today, but I'm shocked that you would think that I had anything to do with it.
we have evidence that you've been working with juma.
your intelligence agencies have failed you.
if I had kno what juma was up to, I would have done everything in my power to stop him.
so let's push aside all these baseless accusations and maybe we can do some business here.
I'm listening.
madam president, I know you're a student of history, and so you're well aware that our nation's independence was won with the aid of private armies, and we can't survive without them.
look how easy it was to get bioweapons into this country.
our defenses are fragile. They're on the verge of collapse.
but it's not too late to do something about it.
so what are you suggesting?
in short, I want a seat at the table.
starkwood needs to be involved in the shaping of military policy, domestic and global.
it sounds more like you want a seat at the head of the table.
madam president, I'm notere to supplant your authority.
what I'm proposing is a partnership.
think of starkwood as the fifth branch of the military. Greg?
this contains the protocols that will serve as the basis of our agreement.
I suggest that we review them together.
Jonas, I agreed to this meeting because I wanted to hear what you had to say.
but what you're proposing is blackmail.
well, that's putting it in the worst possible light.
you are threatening to kill thousands of people.
I'm not proud of this chapter.
I'm the first to admit it.
and it's time to turn the page. This country has seen enough bloodshed today.
for the sake of the american people, madam president,
I implore you to work with me, and let's move past this.
pick up the document, madam president.
let's go. Come on. Get up now, or I'll leave you down here.
and you don't want that believe me. Get up! Let's go!
what is it?
code 363. That's a government breach.
we're supposed to launch. - Are you sure it's not a false alarm?
no way to tell.
we've got standing orders, though.
let's start the launch sequence.
too late.
launch sequence complete. Target is locked.
enter the firing codes.
sir, we need to confirm this.
that's not the correct protocol.
we're about to kill 10, 000 people. We should get someone on the phone.
enter the codes. Now!
no, sir.
that's it. That's us. Let's go. We're a go! We're a go!
it's done. - Tony?
Tony, do you copy?
an explosion of that magnitude would have shorted out his com.
we're gonna have to wait for larry and his men to move in.
it says here that you want active status in the pentagon's strategic planning group.
that's correct.
that would give you access to level 6 classified material.
not even the vice president has that clearance.
these points are nonnegotiable.
I'm not here to debate them.
let's review the next section, which concerns senate oversight of starkwood field operations.
I'm sorry to interrupt, madam president, but I need to speak with you.
can it wait?
no, ma'am, it can'T.
will you excuse me for a moment? - Of course.
satcom has just detected a massive explosion on the starkwood compound.
the bioweapons facility has been destroyed.
are you sure? - Yes, ma'am.
judging by the size of the explosion, nothing could have survived.
but I don't know how this happened. This wasn't us.
call fbi and have them lock down starood. - They're already moving in.
good. And when this is over, I want to speak to jack bauer.
Yes, ma'am. - You know...
I'm not sure I'm reaching her.
I think you handled it perfectly, sir.
we'll see.
what the hell is this?
put this document into evidence, and take these men into custody.
what are you thinking? Have you lost your mind?
Jonas, we've taken out your missiles. It's over.
that's impossible.
it's the truth.
and you're under arrest.
you are a terrorist and a murderer, and I'm gonna do everything in my power to make sure that you pay dearly for your crimes.
my only crime is that I'm trying to protect my country!
you think this ends with me?
I'm just a small cog in a very big machine.
hold on.
you can't even begin to imagine what you're up against.
what are you talking about?
you'll find out.
get him out of here.
the advanced biohazard team is reporting no trace of the bioweapon anywhere near the blast sight.
it was incinerated in the explosion. - Good.
any word on tony? - Not yet. Larry's searching the compound now.
we should hear something soon.
Mr. Bauer, you have a phone call; it's the president.
I'll take it in the conference room. Thank you. I'll be right back.
madam president.
Mr. Bauer, jonas hodges is under arrest.
that's good news. That's very good.
Jack, you and your team provided me with an option.
and for that, I am deeply grateful.
and so are the american people.
madam president, it was tony almeida who risked his life to destroy those missiles.
and as you know, he's facing arrest for things he did leading up to today, and I was hoping that maybe you could...
Yes, mr. Bauer?
um, I'm sorry, I...
completely forgot what I was saying.
you were talking about mr. Almeida.
and my answer is yes, I-I will take his actions into account.
thank you.
what's happening?
I-I-I'm not exactly sure.
Jack, I am so sorry you're going through this.
I wish that there were something I could do.
M-madam president, I appreciate this phone call.
but I'm sorry. I-I have to go.
of course. - Thank you.
Jonas hodges has been arrested.
let me know as soon as you got tony.
I need to go see dr. Mace
Yes, madam president?
call ben landry at cdc.
tell him that I want real-time updates on jack bauer's condition.
Yes, ma'am.
we've secured all entry points and command posts and are sweeping the compound on a grid-by-grid basis.
are you meeting any resistance? - No.
they're surrendering peacefully and cooperating.
St of the men on this base, I don't think they had any idea what was going on.
what about almeida?
uh, he's here. We found him. - Is he okay?
some cuts and bruises, but otherwise, he's in pretty good shape.
good. Good. Jack will be glad to hear that.
listen, renee...
we've known each other a long time, you know.
um, so much stuff has happened today.
Yeah. We have a lot to talk about. I know.
excuse me, agent walker.
your visitshe's in the waiting area. - Okay, thank you.
Larry, I've got to go. Kim bauer's here.
Jack's daughter? - Yes. I-I asked her to come.
there's this experimental treatment for jack's disease, but he needs compatible stem cells.
it's a long shot, but it's the only hope he's got.
okay. Let me know how it goes, all right?
I will. I'm going off com. - All right.
did they say something about kim bauer?
Yeah, she's at fbi helping with a treatment for jack, some, uh, some kind of stem cell therapy.
so they think he's gonna be all right?
didn't sound promising.
listen, tony, this isn't easy for me, but, uh...
I'm under orders to take you into federal custody.
Yeah, I know. - You did a brave thing here.
probably saved thousands of lives.
for the record, I don't think this is how you should be repaid.
I appreciate that, but, uh...
I'm ready to pay for what I've done.
get the cuffs off him, will you?
chopper's on the way. I'll be taking you back to fbi, all right?
memory loss is consistent with the disease, mr. Bauer.
I just wouldn't have expected it to manifest this quickly.
it's not just memory loss.
it feels like...
I don't know exactly how to explain it.
I feel like, uh, like I'm losing some part of myself.
the disease profile includes personality changes, sometimes even hallucinations.
but this is a weaponized pathogen we don't know much about.
military's still combing through the remains of the bioweapons lab in sangala, so we expect to learn something very soon.
you were able to give me something that controlled the shaking.
is there anything that you can give me that would help me with this?
no. I'm sorry.
okay. Thank you. Excuse me.
Jack, is it all right?
Yeah, um, I'm gonna need to go on record about everything that happened today.
and we need to do it soon.
I'm not sure how much longer I'm gonna be to provide you with the details.
okay. First, there's something that you need to know.
what?
it's about kim. She's here, jack.
I told her that you were sick and that she might be able to help with the treatment.
you did...
you did what? Come here. Come here.
who the hell do you think you are?
who the hell do you think you are?
you think this is easy?
you think you understand what I'm going through? Because you don'T.
I am dying.
and I was okay with it. I could handle it.
and now you've put in front of me the one thing, the one thing that is gonna make this unbearable.
Jack, listen... - no, you listen to me.
I specifically told you do not drag my daughter into this.
no one dragged her into anything.
she's been trying to see you all day.
what?
she was at the senate hearing this morning.
she flew out from L. A.To be there, but we pulled you out before she could see you.
she's been leaving messages at our office all day.
they just didn't get to me till now.
if you want, I can tell her that you're not here.
I can tell her that you can't see her.
can't do that.
where is she? - Down the hall.
show me.
daddy.
how are you feeling?
I'm-I'm okay.
you're not in any pain?
no.
come sit down.
did agent walker tell you that I was trying to find you?
Yeah.
I've tried everything to track you down: State department, private investigators.
every time I got a phone number or an address, you were already gone.
I'm sorry.
I thought I was doing the best thing for you by staying away.
daddy, I've missed you so much.
I've missed you, too.
you need to know how sorry I am for everything that you've had to live through because of me.
no, don't do that.
don't put that on yourself. I'm the one that should apologize.
I pushed you away.
and instead of taking responsibility for all the mistakes I've made in my life, I blamed you.
and it was stupid and immature.
and now, all the time that we've lost...
agent walker told me that there's a chance-- a small chance
that I could help you, and you don't want me to.
the treatment is experimental.
and I don't think it's going to work.
and you don't want to because you're afraid to ask me.
no.
there's a risk to you.
a small risk... worth taking.
not to me.
Kim... I'm dying.
and whatever small chance there is to stop that from happening
it is not worth the pain for me to let you sit there and watch me die.
daddy, I don't want to lose you.
come here. - I don't.
sweetheart, it's going to be all right.
it's gonna be all right. I promise you.
what is it? what?
sweetheart, I'm sorry...
but you need to go.
please, baby, please, I'm begging you.
I love you so much. - Honey, I love you, too.
please, baby. thank you. Go.
perimeter 2 to dispatch: Auxiliary gate 6 is clear.
copy that, p-2. Hold your position.
Freeze! Show me your hands. Get 'em up!
P-2 to dispatch.
I have an agent down and a suspect in custody. Code red.
copy that, p-2.
all available agents respond to auxiliary gate 6.
drop the bag.
hands on the hood.
P-2 to dispatch. Put me through to agent moss. It's urgent.
agent moss.
agent moss, this is davis at auxiliary gate 6.
I have a starkwood op in custody.
he killed one of our agents.
he was carrying a canister of the bioweapon, trying to smuggle it out using one of our vehicles.
what? Are you sure?
I'm looking at it right now.
agent davis? Davis?
Walker. - Renee, we got a breach in the cordon at gate 6.
one of the starkwood ops-- he's got a canister of the bioweapon.
what?
it was id'd by agent davis, who I believe has just been shot.
the suspect may be fleeing in an fbi vehicle, so I need you to close down all access roads, and alert perimeter units and metro police.
Janis, get me dc metro. - I'm gonna pursue it from the air.
let's go! Let us up!
Renee, alert homeland, let them know what's going on.
are we thinking this is another attack, larry?
I don't know, but there's enough prion variant in one of those canisters to take out a small city.
agent miller, are there any major roadways in our perimeter that starkwood eratives could have used?
Yes, sir. We're coming up on highway 42.
should I turn us that way?
Yes, until we get a stronger directive from agent walker.
Roger that.
Yes, sir. We'll keep homeland apprised with real-time updates.
did you access the gps locator system?
Yeah, I'm scanning transponders for the stolen fbi vehicle.
how long will that take?
as long as it takes for the satellite to reposition.
when you spoke to larry, you mentioned an attack?
the starkwood operative we're trying to find stole a canister of the bioweapon.
I thought tony almeida destroyed all the weapons.
apparently not.
how did this operative get past our perimeter?
shot and killed two of our agents.
this is it.
the suspect is getting off highway 42 at smoketree avenue.
he's heading toward the industrial corridor.
put me on the interagency channel. - Go ahead.
all units, this is agent walker with fbi.
suspect has exited highway 42 at smoketree.
he's heading north into the industrial corridor.
units in the vicinity, please respond.
Renee, it's me. We're over smoketree right now.
we're redirecting, and we'll tighten our pursuit.
got it. I'll reroute swat team alpha to the scene.
SWAT team alpha, we need to set up a roadblock at the fairfax county line.
DC metro's covering the district line in case he tries to double back.
sir. I have a visual.
Yeah. Got him.
send us lower.
Yeah, he's pulling off the road. Get us down there now.
Renee, it's larry. Suspect is on foot. We can't wait for backup.
we're moving in right now. - All right. Swat team's a few minutes out.
careful, larry. - Yeah.
remember, suspect has a canister, so pick your shots.
if possible, let's take him alive.
Yes, sir.
we got to get out of here. Almeida, cover. Let's go.
come on!
relax. - I'm okay.
relax.
what...
I'm sorry, larry.
God...
let me see it.
how the hell do we get out of here?
I want you to take this, find a place to hide.
wait for my call. - What about you?
I'm gonna wait on the fbi, figure out a way to get you out of here. Go!
GALVEZ: You want me to blow up a couple of dozen FBI agents?
you got a problem with that?
Jack: Agent Walker, this is Jack.
get your men out of the building-- it's a trap.
you got the canister?
clearly, Hodges is behind this.
he's a sociopath, Mom.
he's not going to talk-- he's going to want to make some kind of deal in exchange for his cooperation.
mom, you're not considering that. Olivia...
you know what this man is, what he did to Roger.
I've upset the cart, have I?
Cara: That bioweapon that you developed for us was not intended for personal use.
I think we can both agree that there's no reason for your family to pay for your mistakes.
this will induce a cardiac arrest and leave no trace in your system.
we are rerouting to West Arlington Hospital.
have you heard from Almeida?
Cara: I called him before I met with Hodges.
has he secured the canister?
soon. He's your guy.
he better not screw this up.
I have faith he'll come through.
there is no treatment.
there is no cure.
almost like they knew, Jack.
they would have needed time to wire this building with explosives.
this is the last sector we were due to search.
Jack, what is it?
what is your involvement?
you're not thinking straight.
the toxin's starting to affect your judgment.
now, why don't you put the gun down. Don't you move!
I never wanted to hurt you, Jack.
I told you to stay out of it.
we get some help here?
this man's having a seizure.
MACER: Mr. Bauer, you should be feeling better already.
I'm giving you five cc's of intravenous pendopamine.
it'll de-constrict your muscles.
just hang in there.
don't talk.
your vocal cords are in spasm.
what the hell happened?
Tony Almeida found him in full seizure.
what about the medication pack you gave him?
wasn't carrying it.
S-s-stop.
Mr. Bauer, please don't speak.
stop...
Tony...
Tony?
I don't understand.
he's... second man.
Jack, what... Put out an APB.
how do you know this?
do it!
attention, all patrols and perimeter teams, this is Alpha One.
I'm issuing a priority APB on Tony Almeida.
approach with extreme caution.
he's colluding with Galvez and should be considered hostile.
all units who engage the suspect should do so with extreme caution.
you really need to give yourself more time to recover.
here's another med pack.
make sure he doesn't lose it.
I need to go tend to the other wounded.
all right, tell me what the hell is going on.
Tony was working with Galvez all along.
he used us, all of us, so that he could get to the canister.
Tony killed Larry?
Yeah.
they must have ambushed him as the chopper was setting down.
Tony stayed behind so he could monitor our search, set the trap and make sure Galvez could get beyond the perimeter.
Oh, God.
I'm so sorry.
this is my fault.
I vouched for him to you, to the president.
I made a terrible, terrible mistake.
I felt that something was wrong. g.
things weren't adding up.
I just...
I just wanted to believe him.
alpha One, this is Agent Kilner.
alpha One-- go ahead.
agent Walker, I'm at checkpoint Delta.
I've got two agents dead, shot point-blank.
their vehicle is missing.
okay, he's made it past the perimeter.
tracking on the vehicle has been disabled-- position is unknown.
widen the perimeter, and keep looking for Almeida.
if we lose him, we lose the canister.
copy that.
you're not gonna find him-- he's gone.
we need to phone the president.
let's go.
you made it.
you sound surprised.
after Bauer called you out, I wasn't sure you would.
you don't have to worry about Jack Bauer.
he's not gonna be a problem.
so, where is the canister?
Where's the money?
Hey, that was our agreement.
money first.
there you go.
it's all there, wired into your account.
you can check it if you want.
I want.
everything okay?
Yeah.
so, where is the canister?
right here.
so, what are you planning on doing with it?
not really your business, is it?
you gonna sell it?
you don't want to do this.
Hey, who's the damn buyer?
Where's the canister?
where is the damn canister?!
one of the marines that was guarding Hodges noticed he was trying to swallow something.
he intervened, got him to the hospital before the poison could be completely ingested.
so, he'll survive?
Yes, ma'am, but the doctors are surprised he pulled through.
that's because they never met the son of a bitch.
how did Hodges get this poison?
we suspect from a woman who claimed to be his attorney.
claimed to be?
she was an impostor.
DC Police found the body of Hodges' real attorney about five minutes ago.
we're still trying to determine how she managed to breach security.
woman: Madam President, Agent Walker and Jack Bauer.
put them through.
this is President Taylor.
I'm here with Tim Woods.
RENEE: Madam President...
have you secured the canister?
I'm afraid not, ma'am.
our suspect escaped beyond the perimeter.
I was told that the area was locked down.
what happened?
he had help, Madam President.
from Tony Almeida.
Almeida?
Yes, ma'am.
he was working for us.
it only appeared that way.
apparently, he was pursuing his own agenda, trying to get his hands on the canister.
madam President, I know I vouched for him.
all I can tell you right now is that I was wrong and I'm sorry.
now that we know he has the canister, do we have any idea what he intends to do with it?
no, not yet. Or where he is?
we're all hands on deck here, sir, regrouping to develop leads.
I may have one.
as Hodges was taken into custody, he yelled at me about some larger group that would continue on after his arrest.
something that I wouldn't be able to stop.
what do you think he meant?
well, all I know for sure is that someone doesn't want Hodges to talk.
shortly after he was arrested,
Hodges was visited by a woman impersonating his lawyer.
she apparently gave him some kind of lethal drug, because ten minutes later, he tried to commit suicide.
tried to commit suicide?
Oh, he's still alive.
Jonas Hodges was completely unrepentant.
now, this suicide attempt must have been coerced.
well, obviously, they're holding something over him, most likely his family.
if that's the case, Madam President, we need to talk to him.
Jack, even after everything that's happened today,
I will not allow any kind of coercive interrogation.
madam President, that won't be necessary.
he'll talk. How can you be sure?
because we can offer Hodges something that he needs.
and what's that?
proof of death: we can convince the people that wanted him dead that they succeeded.
it's the only way Hodges can protect his family.
madam President, right now, he's the only lead we've got.
Hey.
I'll assume that was necessary.
don't start with me.
I'm not in the mood.
all right.
Mr. Galvez decided to hide the canister from me, so, uh, I had to find out where it was.
we've got a delivery to make.
shall we go?
no, I don't think we should.
they're expecting us.
Yeah, well, the way I see it, they're gonna take this canister that I sweated blood for and sit on it for six months.
not sit on it.
they're gonna use it to make more pathogen.
we had 27 canisters; now we have one.
Yeah, and I say one's enough.
look...
the government's reeling.
the FBI is stretched thin
scrambling, making mistakes.
another attack today is all we need to push this thing right over the edge.
this is no time to pull back.
I say we take that canister, and finish the job off today.
I don't disagree with you but it's not our decision to make.
fine.
then run it by your group or your gang or whatever the hell they are.
but they'll know one thing.
you finish your enemy off when he's down.
you don't let him get back up and reload.
I guarantee you, this thing's gonna be a hell of a lot harder to pull off six months from now.
and you can say what you want about Jonas Hodges, the fact is, he gave us an opportunity today.
let's take it.
I'll contact the group.
good.
what did she say exactly?
only that she needs to see you and that it's urgent.
I heard rumors about the FBI operation.
I'm sure your mother will fill you in, ma'am.
Olivia.
is it true the FBI perimeter was breached?
I'm afraid so.
the canister is now outside the cordon.
what are we doing to get it back?
Tim, would you excuse us for a moment?
of course.
what is it?
I need you to call the Attorney General and draft a witness protection agreement for Jonas Hodges.
witness protection?
you can't be serious.
less than an hour ago,
Hodges tried to kill himself.
and we all believe that he must've been coerced.
by whom?
you remember his rant
that he is a cog in a larger conspiracy, that there are others who will carry on.
you think they're the ones who took the canister?
well, we need to find out.
which is why we need to get Hodges to talk.
Olivia, we feel confident that he will if we can assure him that these people will believe that his suicide attempt actually succeeded.
we need to make him disappear.
which is why I need the protection agreement.
there is no other way he'll talk.
designate him an enemy combatant, then treat him like one.
we don't do that.
not in this administration.
and it's not as if he's getting a free pass.
he'll be under federal supervision for the rest of his life.
Oh, yeah, on a hundred acre ranch in Colorado!
this man murdered your son!
my brother.
not to mention hundreds of innocent civilians.
I don't need you to tell me what he's done.
apparently you do.
Olivia, stop it!
what would Dad say?
I bet you're afraid to ask.
I said stop!
do you think that this is easy for me?
you think it doesn't tear me apart?
I'm Roger's mother.
but I am also the President of the United States and I placed my hand on a Bible and swore to protect and defend the Constitution.
you are my Chief of Staff.
I need you to act like one.
now, Jonas Hodges is at the FBI, and Jack Bauer will be there shortly.
I need an agreement drafted.
do that please.
the plan is straightforward
an attack today this morning during rush hour using the bioweapon that Tony Almeida retrieved from Starkwood.
you should have each received a data pack when you logged on to this call.
please open it now.
the attack will be attributed to this man,
Jibraan Al-Zarian
whose body will be left at the scene.
the evidence trail implicating him will include fabricated e-mails, phone records, and a large wire transfer to his account via our favorite Yemini bank.
I'm looking at the briefing materials and I'm not seeing how this man is actually connected to any terrorist group.
he isn't.
as previously discussed, there are considerable tactical advantages to using an innocent.
but what about his unpredictability?
Al-Zarian has no agenda of his own.
he'll in fact be easier to control and manipulate than a real terrorist. So what are the casualty estimates?
page three describes the casualties estimates as well as secondary effects.
as you can see, we've listed... Hold on.
we're talking about launching a new operation in the next few hours.
without any planning.
and with only one canister.
woman: The plan for this operation was already in place.
we'd just be accelerating the timetable.
we were going to have six months to prepare.
there's no way to pull it together in a few hours.
I believe there is.
with the support of this group.
man: Support for whom?
this Tony Almeida we barely know?
and what about postattack plans?
how's this group going to end up where we need to be?
man 2: I agree. How we handle ourselves politically in the aftermath of this event is just as important as the attack itself.
woman: It always has been.
man: In your opinion, is there time then to achieve all our objectives in the current scenario?
woman: Not with the same level of certainty.
man 2: Or anonymity.
woman: That's right.
man: Well, then, maybe it's, uh, definitive.
woman: What do you mean?
man: There's no downside to waiting.
there's a huge downside to going in unprepared.
things go wrong, we're looking at exposure
for all of us.
man 2: No, no, I still don't see it that way.
gentlemen.
ladies.
I've listened to your comments and there's wisdom in what I've heard.
but there's also wisdom in something I haven't heard.
Jonas Hodges was a loose cannon, and the group is well rid of him.
but, in his lunacy, he did us a favor.
he did half our job for us.
more than half.
he pushed this country to the brink.
you don't get many gifts like that.
I say we take it.
we have a quorum,
I'd like to call for an immediate vote.
Tony.
how'd it go?
take a look.
we're a go.
Where's Hodges now? Down the hall.
we've set up a medical suite in Secure Z.
and the death certificate?
done.
as far as the world knows, he's molding on a slab at the coroner's. Keep it that way.
no one knows he's alive unless they have to. No, just the ambulance driver, the medical team and three security.
all trustworthy.
wait.
are you sure he's up for this?
I know what happened out there.
medication worked. He'll be okay.
I'm not talking about the seizure.
I'm talking about the Tony Almeida situation.
what about it?
his former partner betrays him, he tries to have you all killed
Jack must have some feelings about that.
Yeah.
Yeah, I think it's what's keeping him going.
listen to me.
listen to me.
is anyone listening?
I know you're watching.
I see the cameras!
I know you're watching.
do you realize what you people have done?
you didn't save me, you killed my family!
you killed my family!
you killed them!
killed them. How long has he been conscious? Ten minutes.
he's been talking about his family ever since.
biometrics are over here.
cardiac, respiratory, plus dermal infrared.
good. We'll know if he's lying.
Jack, the president is monitoring this.
sergeant, I'm asking you, soldier to soldier, let me have your firearm.
I'll use one... one bullet on myself.
please.
Jack: Relax, Mr. Hodges.
you're already dead.
sergeant.
who are you?
my name is Jack Bauer.
and right now, I'm the only chance your wife and children have to stay alive.
explain that to me.
the people that wanted you dead don't know you survived.
tell us who they are, and we'll keep it that way.
Jack: The President has agreed to provide you with a death certificate and witness protection in exchange for actionable information.
I can't watch this anymore.
if you refuse, it'll be released to the press that you are alive and in our custody and that you're cooperating.
we'll let your friends take care of the rest.
my family is innocent.
the president would never allow that to happen.
she doesn't have the stomach for it.
Jack: You might be right about that.
but make no mistake about it, sir.
I do.
trust me.
do your family a favor.
just tell me who you've been working with.
I am
I was
part of a larger group of like minds.
you mean, other companies like Starkwood.
I mean people who can protect this country better than any government ever could.
Jack: There are hundreds of private military companies in this country, we're talking tens of thousands of people.
but only a handful with the guts and the vision to do what was necessary.
and what is that?
the plan was to launch simultaneous attacks early next year.
multiple cities.
so the public would finally see that the government can't protect them.
they'd demand drastic measures and we'd step in.
how would you justify that to the American people?
simple.
offload the blame.
we were going to supply the enemies that want to destroy this country.
muhammed this, Achmed that.
from sleeper cells the apologists say don't even exist.
you of all people should understand.
understand what?
I watched the Senate hearing yesterday, and I was disgusted with how you were treated.
you should be regarded as a hero, not a criminal.
I broke the law.
you were following your instinct to protect your country, just like me.
Mr. Hodges, I need the names of the people that you are working with.
I have spent my entire life protecting this country from enemies large and small.
I created Starkwood from the ground up.
and the government used us to great effect.
and now they think they can just throw us away.
are you telling me that this has been about protecting your contracts, about money?
I tried to tell the politicians how vulnerable we are, and they wouldn't listen.
so we decided to show them.
Jack: By attacking your own country with a biological weapon?
by killing innocent people?
Yes, a few innocent lives would be lost, but only to save the greater number.
having the courage to make those hard choices gives us a lot in common, Mr. Bauer.
let me explain something to you.
you and I have absolutely nothing in common.
all that you have done today is create a scenario by attacking your own country that has made you valuable again.
today has been nothing short of a desperate grab for power, and it has failed.
you have failed, and unless you want me to go public with the fact that you are still alive, you are gonna give me the names of the people that you've been working with.
I-I don't have them. I want the names.
I don't have any. I want the names!
I don't know any!
fine.
patch me through to Amy Meyer at the Washington Post.
no.
Amy, it's Jack. I have a statement I need to make.
wait!
wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Give me the names!
I swear... I swear I don't have them.
this whole project was... was based on anonymity.
we never met in person.
everything was handled through an intermediary, a woman.
she never told me who she was.
she never told me her name.
I never asked her.
the same woman that gave you the poison?
Yes, yes.
Amy, I'm sorry. Something's come up.
I've got to call you back.
you tell yourself whatever you want.
you are a traitor.
witness Protection was your promise.
Yeah.
madam President, did you hear everything that Hodges had to say?
Yes. Is any of it even credible?
all of it is. Biometric monitors here indicate that he was telling the truth.
whoever they are, this group just went through an awful lot of trouble to get their hands on that last canister.
it seems very clear to me that their plan is still on.
you mean another attack? Yes, ma'am.
I think you should proceed under the assumption that they might strike immediately.
hold on.
Hodges said some time next year.
no. Hodges said that was the plan.
given the chaos that he created today, the smart strategic move would be to act right now.
now, I believe the canister is still in this area, so we're gonna have to alert Homeland, have them start identifying and raiding targets.
Hodges said that the plan was to enlist parties with terrorist ties.
at this point, I think that might be our most solid lead.
madam President, I agree with Agent Walker.
we need to make an immediate threat assessment with focus on all known terrorist activity.
the fastest way for us to get that information is to gain access to the CTU servers that have been sealed as a result of Senator Mayer's investigation.
I'll have them recommissioned immediately.
and consider the resources of this government at your disposal, Jack.
thank you, ma'am.
I need those servers right away.
they're in DOJ evidence lockers on the third floor.
I'll have I. T. break them out.
okay, good.
we have a new shift of analysts coming in, if you can tell them what you're looking for.
no, we don't have time.
we need someone who already knows the protocols.
I'll take care of it.
just get me those servers.
who is it?
Hey, it's me Jack.
Jack, where the hell are you?
the FBI headquarters.
I've been trying to reach you all night.
no one will tell me anything.
is it true about Bill?
Yeah, I'm afraid so.
what happened?
he was killed during the White House siege.
Chloe, you should know,
bill sacrificed his life to save the president.
listen to me.
this threat is not over.
we believe that there's going to be a biological attack somewhere in the area.
soon. I need your help to stop it.
how?
I need you to reconstitute the CTU servers.
they were seized when the CTU was decommissioned.
I don't have access to them.
you will by the time you get here.
who's doing this?
we don't have all the players.
I'll fill you in with as much as I know when you get here.
I'm sending a car over to your hotel.
Chloe?
send a car.
thank you.
Morris, wake up.
what? Are you speaking to me again now?
I have to go.
I need you to take Prescott and get out of the city.
Why? I just spoke with Jack.
there's going to be another attack.
this time, it's biological.
okay, then we'll all get out of here together.
I can't. FBI needs me.
but the last time you worked for these people, they arrested you.
I know.
but I'm the only one that can get the servers back online.
well, I'm not gonna leave you here.
not with the possibility of a biological attack.
please.
I'm the only one that can do this.
and Jack needs me.
and I just need for you and Prescott to be safe.
okay?
I'll see you back at home.
just... be careful.
I will.
RENEE: All right, before we begin, everyone make sure you have your updated briefing packets, and the latest CDC abstract.
Jack, whenever you're ready.
thank you.
I know many of you have lost friends and colleagues today.
I have, too.
unfortunately, the time to mourn these brave men and women is going to have to wait.
cause, as many of you are already aware, we are facing the threat of a terrorist event somewhere on the Eastern seaboard.
we don't have specific intel as to the time table of this attack, but we do have reason to believe that the people that are behind this will want to strike immediately.
excuse me.
tim Moran, field ops.
who are the people behind this?
right now, we only have two confirmed suspects.
Tony Almeida and the woman he's been working with.
we're still trying to identify her.
the assumption is, the two of them are part of a broader conspiracy as outlined in your briefing material.
and the nature of the attack?
all it says here is biological.
the actual pathogen is a prion variant, designed to attack the central nervous system and ultimately destroy it.
do we know what the target is?
no, not yet. We're also unclear on the specifics of the delivery device.
well, what leads do we have?
right now, we are solely working off an operational theory that the people that are behind this will need to manufacture evidence in an effort to offload the blame for this attack to either another group or an individual with terrorist sympathies.
during the ensuing panic, these people will move in and seize power under the guise of creating and maintaining stability.
so, our job here is to look for traces of that manufactured evidence.
how exactly?
pattern searches of suspicious financial transactions.
keyword intercepts of existing wiretaps, websites and e-mails.
and data-mining all
NSA and CIA intelligence on jihadist activities over the past six months.
JANIS: Excuse me.
not only is that type of blanket surveillance illegal.
we don't have the capacity to pull it off.
the search algorithms simply don't exist. Yes, they do.
at CTU. Those servers were decommissioned.
not anymore. They're here.
we're in the process of installing them now.
well, what does that make us, CTU-lite?
last I heard, the Bureau was a federal entity bound by federal statute.
Janis, do this or I will find someone else who will.
I do not have time to argue.
I'm not arguing. I'm asking.
moving on.
I've got her from here. Thanks.
Jack. Hey.
thanks for coming.
you look like hell.
are you all right? I'm fine.
you don't look fine.
maybe a little tired.
did you get the report I sent you?
Yeah. I read it on the way over.
it's terrifying. How real is this? Real.
we're getting access to the CTU servers, right?
Yeah. They're coming online now.
shouldn't I be supervising this?
Yeah. Look, there's something I need to talk to you about before we get started.
there's no easy way for me to say this.
but Tony's been responsible for these attacks.
that's not possible.
he was using you and Bill all along.
he's really been working for a group of private military firms trying to destabilize this country in an effort to seize power.
so far today, his actions have cost the lives of hundreds of people.
but he's threatening thousands more.
it doesn't make any sense.
I know he was devastated over Michelle, but...
Chloe, he's not your friend.
the Tony that you knew-- he doesn't exist anymore.
there has to be a reason.
a reason for what?
bringing down two passenger planes?
trying to ambush 25 federal agents?
Chloe, he tried to kill me.
he betrayed us all-- you, me, and Bill, and right now our only responsibility is to stop him.
now, I need to know that you can treat him as an enemy combatant, that you are with me on this.
okay, I'll do whatever you say.
no, I need to know that you are with me on this.
I'm with you.
okay.
let's go.
his name is Jibraan Al-Zarian.
27 years old.
he's a day laborer at Cabrera Granite Construction.
immigration status?
illegal.
his visa expired as of January.
ties to any extremist groups?
no, none, but there's definitely anger there.
both parents were killed in a U. S. air strike by the Pakistani border.
he was 11 at the time.
fits the psych profile.
bit of a loner, a mystery to his coworkers, and we build the rest.
what about the family?
one younger brother, who he's pretty much raised on his own.
it's perfect, huh?
newscaster: Though it is doubtful that anyone sleeps very well in D. C. tonight, a certain calm has now settled over the streets of Capitol Hill after an unprecedented series of terror attacks left people all over the country shaken and demanding answers.
in her speech, President Taylor went a long way...
Hey.
morning.
pour yourself some orange juice.
I'm not really very hungry.
sit down, eat some breakfast for once.
it's unhealthy not to.
what are you doing up anyway?
I, uh, couldn't sleep.
listen, uh, I want you to come home straight after work today.
okay?
no dillydallying.
Why?
just in case.
in case of what?
these attacks, this terrorism
it's all over the news.
okay, it's not a good day to be a Muslim.
Jibraan, Muslims had nothing to do with it.
doesn't matter.
nobody cares, believe me.
most of the guys at my work think I'm Puerto Rican anyway.
it's about time.
come in.
excuse me, Ms. Taylor.
what is it?
the attorney general asked me to check in with you.
he is waiting to sign off on a document
I was told you were reviewing.
anyone happen to mention to you what this document is about?
no, ma'am.
no, I imagine they wouldn't.
it's a secret, highly classified.
not that I give a damn.
: it's a get-out- of-jail-free card for Jonas Hodges, the bastard responsible for my brother's death and so many others.
I don't understand, ma'am.
Mr. Hodges died in the hospital.
I wish that were the case, but no, and once the A. G. signs this witness protection agreement,
Hodges is going to live out his days in comfort and anonymity while my brother lies in his grave in Arlington Cemetery.
does that sound like justice to you, Aaron?
no, ma'am, it does not.
and yet my mother saw fit to reward this monster for his cooperation.
well, I'm sure it was a difficult decision for the president to make.
not difficult enough.
my mother may be able to live with it, but I'm not sure I can.
ms. Taylor, I have seen the guilty walk free many times.
I understand your anger and frustration, and I am genuinely sorry.
um...
tell the A. G. I've reviewed the agreement and we can move ahead.
thank you, ma'am.
is there anything else that I can do for you?
other than kill Jonas Hodges, no.
I'm sorry, Aaron.
I didn't mean that.
I was just venting.
ma'am.
Hello?
Olivia: Martin?
it's Olivia Taylor.
did I wake you?
well, as a matter of fact, yes.
what time is it?
almost 4: 00.
actually I didn't expect to catch you at home.
I thought you were in Florida doing opposition for the Gainor campaign.
no, that didn't really work out.
why not?
let's just say that my methods were a little hardball for the governor's taste.
so... what can I do for you, Olivia?
you heard about the attack on the White House?
Yeah, I watched your mother's address to the nation.
really impressive.
she continues to surprise, doesn't she?
listen, Martin, I need your help.
can we meet?
now? Yeah.
well, what's this about, Olivia?
I can't talk about it over the phone.
well, it's the middle of the night, you know?
y-you got to do better than that.
we were in a dive hotel bar in Atlanta right after we picked Hayworth to be the running mate on the ticket.
there was an issue regarding his abuse of a certain prescription drug and a local reporter who couldn't be persuaded to shut up about it.
I remember you turned to me and said there was no problem that couldn't be handled or eliminated.
Uh-huh.
well, I was drunk.
you were serious.
you know, you're right.
we shouldn't be talking about this over the phone.
how soon can you be at the White House?
how's 15 minutes sound?
good.
chloe: You done with that yet?
I'm not familiar with these commands.
Oh, you don't want to boot the subnet with server two.
it has a faulty bus that we weren't able to fix before you guys impounded it.
well, maybe you'd like to take over.
only if you want it to work right.
I don't like this either.
is there a problem? Yes, there is.
I'm not comfortable doing this.
I agreed to it, but I don't like it.
what exactly aren't you comfortable with?
uh, well, the Bill of Rights being violated, for one, so if you're going to be doing anything grossly illegal, please...
we'll make sure we notify you so you can leave the building.
Hello, Big Brother.
look, if you think your need to complain is more important than the lives of the people that are counting on us, go whine somewhere else!
Jack, it's okay. No, it is not okay!
president David Palmer recommissioned these servers because he felt it was vital to national security!
president Palmer made the call!
is that going to be good enough for you?!
answer me!
Yes.
there's something really wrong with him.
he said President Palmer.
he meant Taylor.
he said it twice.
what is this now?
probably a fuse.
here, you do what you can to finish up.
I'm gonna go check the box.
Jibraan!
Hamid?
Jibra...
Hamid?
keep your mouth shut and no one gets hurt.
who are you? What do you want? Shut up!
what did you do to my brother?
Hamid! One more word,
I put a bullet in your brain.
understand?
it's him.
damn it.
I couldn't get off a shot.
stand by.
we'll get him on the way out.
Manuel!
Hey, Manny!
Manny!
Hey, Manny!
yes?
put Mauricio on the phone.
Victor? - Just put Mauricio on!
he's dead.
what?
someone shot him in the head.
what the hell is happening?
I see him.
he's leaving the building.
I'm set.
stop.
it's not him.
he can't be far.
coming at you! Gray sedan!
target is out of range.
move out.
911. What's your emergency?
Yes. I want to report a stolen vehicle.
license plate SNE15C5.
Jack?
Oh.
sweetheart, we already talked about this, remember?
you're supposed to call me "Grandpa.
you don't look like a grandpa.
couldn't agree with you more.
the cartoon I turned on is boring.
okay. We'll find another one.
this is the boldest diplomatic initiative we've seen in a generation.
it could finally lay a foundation for real peace throughout the entire region.
well, you know, Bob, the president's certainly betting her legacy on the success of these negotiations...
grandpa!
this isn't a cartoon!
okay, okay.
# A sloth of bears... #
this one! I like this one!
# A mob of cows #
# A herd of sheep... #
yeah?
Hi, Dad. Sorry we're late.
they're redirecting everyone around the UN.
it's all right. We're doing fine.
how was the zoo?
well, to be honest with you, we spent most of our time just going back and forth between the black bears and the polar bears.
I forgot to mention that she's going through a bear phase.
well, she certainly knows what she wants.
she reminds me of you.
well, that's funny.
I always tell Stephen how much she reminds me of you.
anyway, we'll be there in a few minutes.
okay. Don't worry.
we'll meet you in the lobby.
great.
sounds like they had fun.
they always do.
what's wrong?
we talked to him about moving to LA the night we got here.
Yeah. He said he'd think about it.
Yeah, and he hasn't mentioned one word about it since.
and we leave tonight.
well, maybe he has to check with his doctors.
no, they cleared him two weeks ago.
he's finished with treatment.
I don't know.
my father has been on his own for so long.
maybe he doesn't know how to live any other way.
why don't you just ask him again?
my father is not the type of person you ask twice.
if you want, I can do it.
here at the United Nations, a White House spokesman just confirmed that Presidents Taylor and Hassan will be holding a joint press conference later this hour.
it is widely expected that President Hassan will announce the dismantling of his country's nuclear weapons program.
president Hassan has stated that he considers these negotiations a historic success and a new beginning for his country and the entire Mideast region.
I believe that that is a reasonable compromise.
now, Mr. President, let's move on to the issue of verification.
now, the language in your latest proposal is vague.
let me be clear.
my country agrees to abandon the pursuit of nuclear weapons with full International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards.
but our terms, Mr. President, were that the inspectors themselves would be American, not IAEA.
with respect, Madam President, your side pushed the point, but we never conceded.
with respect, your side has refused to negotiate the point in good faith.
without Americans on the ground...
surely, we're not going to let the nationality of a few hundred men...
verification has no teeth.
so, only the United States can be trusted, Mr. Secretary?
this is the message that you sent to the rest of the world and then you wonder why we don't want to negotiate.
Farhad.
madam President, please excuse my brother's passion.
he only wants what is best for our country.
I understand.
but we need to resolve this issue before we can move forward.
and ideally, before the press conference, which gives us less than an hour.
Madame President...
what would your Congress say if my Revolutionary Guard was stationed on your soil?
it's the same with my
national Assembly.
even if I agreed to this, they would not ratify it.
after all, I'm not a king.
nor I a queen.
too bad for both of us.
I'd like to adjourn and discuss this issue with our respective teams.
of course.
you are aware he was a salesman before entering politics.
household appliances.
you want to bet he sold a lot of refrigerators?
find a way to give him what he wants.
madam President...
you heard me.
try to make the inspections work.
this man is a once in a lifetime leader.
and he has already suspended his support for terrorist organizations, and privately, he's advocating for a two-state solution.
how much further can we expect him to stick his neck out?
Hey, come here.
did you name him yet? - Bear.
bear. - There she is.
Hi!
Hey! I heard that you and Grandpa were hanging out with the bears.
then we had ice cream, but I didn't like mine, so Grandpa gave me his.
that's nice. - Here, I got her.
thanks for watching her, Jack. - Of course.
listen, I've been thinking a lot about what we talked about.
and I've made up my mind.
I want to move back to Los Angeles with you.
Really? - Yeah.
I got a friend who's got a private security firm.
said he'd give me some consulting work.
he's also got a place I can rent.
dad, I don't know what to say.
come here.
you don't have to say anything.
just give me a ride to the airport tonight.
wait, you're coming with us tonight?
if it's okay.
Stephen.
he's coming with us tonight.
and I've just got a few more things to pack.
I don't have very much. I can be at your hotel in about an hour.
that's perfect. We can get back and finish packing ourselves.
it'll be all right if I fly back to Los Angeles with you?
Yay! - Yay!
come on. I'll walk you to the car.
okay. Let's go.
Yay! - I got her.
okay. - We're going in the car.
get your belt done up...
dad, I am so glad that you're doing this.
me, too.
I love you. - Love you.
okay, guys, I'll see you in an hour. - See you.
okay. Bye, sweetheart.
Bye!
good afternoon, everyone.
good afternoon.
all right, just a few things before we get started here.
presidents Taylor and Hassan will each make a statement after they've been introduced by the Secretary-General.
the Q&A will follow, but I want you to keep your questions strictly on topic.
for obvious reasons, we're all operating under heightened security measures, so, unless you've been dying to know what a chokehold feels like, keep your credentials visible at all times.
all right?
that's all for now.
Meredith Reed, press.
it's invalid.
what?
it can't be invalid.
can you double check?
I did, ma'am. Your credentials have been revoked.
revoked by whom?
I don't have that information.
okay, this has to be some sort of mistake.
you do remember me. I've been here every day.
please step aside, ma'am.
I just talked to Secretary of State Kanin.
he's agreed to IAEA inspectors.
that's good news.
there is a condition attached.
they're insisting that the head of the verification team be an American.
I think we can live with that, don't you?
you know where I stand.
we've already surrendered too much in the name of peace.
surrender is a strong word, Farhad.
and what have we surrendered really, apart from our nuclear ambition?
isn't that enough?
spinning 6, 000 centrifuges is good for political maneuvering, but it's helping to bankrupt our country.
the truth is, we are not the ones being so generous.
president Taylor is lifting economic sanctions, and offering an aid package worth billions of dollars.
we got everything we wanted, Farhad.
as long as it's not a trick.
hello.
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you with something so mundane, but I'm stuck outside.
stuck?
my press credentials have been revoked.
I don't know what happened.
I'll take care of it.
are you sure?
of course.
thank you.
will you, uh, will you still have time for the interview later?
Yes. After the press conference.
I'm looking forward to it, Mr. President.
so am I.
reinstate Miss Reed's clearance.
I was only...
just do it.
Omar, people are starting to talk about you and this reporter.
and saying what?
miss Reed is a journalist and she's profiling me for her newspaper.
but you have feelings for her.
I'm friendly with her.
think whatever you like.
this woman poses no threat to me or the peace process.
not here maybe, but back in our country you'll be torn apart.
the mullahs will say that you have been corrupted by the West.
what do you say, Farhad?
have I?
have I been corrupted by the West?
you know I don't believe that.
but you are married.
Dalia hasn't been a wife to me for a long time.
that's no excuse to be reckless.
I've done nothing reckless.
I've done nothing reckless.
just reinstate Miss Reed's clearance now.
I'll see to it.
what are you doing here?
how the hell did you find me?
I was always resourceful, Jack.
that's what you liked about me. - Get in here.
take a seat.
what happened?
I need help.
you need an ambulance.
no, no, don't call.
that's what he's waiting for.
he's listening to the emergency channels. - Who?
just listen to me, Jack. I have information.
the best I can do for you, Victor, is get you an ambulance.
I'm out. I don't work for the government anymore.
Oh, this you're going to want to hear.
Why?
Why? Because you're the guy who always does the right thing.
there's a big hit going down.
on who?
president Hassan at the UN.
he's getting taken out.
when? - Today.
before he can sign this thing with Taylor.
you see? I told you you'd be interested.
how do you know this?
I'm the one that got the hitter into the country.
I've been setting him up with what he needs.
and then he tried to take you out.
look, Jack, you're the only one at CTU I ever did business with.
I need you to call them, vouch for me, so I can cut a deal.
come on, Jack.
keep your seat.
look, I swear, this is real.
someone is trying to make sure that this peace agreement does not happen.
I'm not doing anything until you give me your weapon.
better not be screwing with me.
I'm not. I swear, I'm not.
who's the hitter? What's his name?
who's the hitter?!
I don't know his name.
he's Russian or something. - Not good enough.
who is the hitter?! - Look.
I know how to find him and stop him before he makes the hit.
but I'm not saying another word until I make my deal.
you're lucky I'm retired.
this is Cole Ortiz.
move Singer's team to the northeast quadrant, and tell him, from now on,
I want updates every quarter hour.
get back to me with confirmations.
Hastings wants you to expand the patrol perimeter around the UN another quarter mile.
I'm glad that's what he wants, but I barely have enough men to cover the perimeter now.
I'll see if I can get NYPD to help you cover.
uh, Dana?
my sister...
she said she left you a couple of messages.
something about bridesmaids' dresses.
I told her there was probably something wrong with your voicemail.
I got her messages.
I just haven't had a chance. These double shifts...
I revised the patrol protocols at the UN.
thought you might like - to take a look at it before I distributed it. - Yeah.
Yeah, I do. - I will call your sister back, I promise.
Thanks.
damn it, what is the problem?
percussive maintenance?
that's what my network apps professor called it when I hit my computer.
can I help?
I just got the revised attendee list for the press conference. I can't get the facial recognition done in time.
Oh, you're running each person through individually.
you can do them in a batch.
not if the data's in different formats.
well, that used to be true, but here.
like I said, there's no reason to be shy about asking for help.
okay? Don't worry.
you'll catch up. You're doing great.
excuse me.
Chloe, it's Jack.
how's Kim? Did you tell her about LA?
Yeah, but I can't go into that right now.
I need to speak to the director.
Mr. Hastings is on the phone, and he really doesn't like to be interrupted.
well, tell him it's regarding a plot to assassinate President Hassan.
see if that gets his attention.
Oh. Okay, hold on.
all right, now, give me an overlay on the UN, view from the west.
now, overlay the distribution of security teams, please.
that looks good.
now, give me a comp with incident reports and - satellite imaging. - Excuse me, Mr. Hastings.
Gary, hold on for a second.
Jack Bauer's on line three. He says he needs - to talk to you. - Bauer?
it's about a plot against President Hassan.
I thought you'd want to take the call.
Gary, I'll call you back.
Mr. Bauer, this is Brian Hastings.
Mr. Hastings, I'm with an informant that I used to run who's claiming he's got intel on an assassination attempt on President Hassan.
he says it's going to take place today.
we've received several threats in regard to the peace conference.
I can only imagine.
my informant's name is Victor Aruz.
I used him in the Salazar op.
you should be able to pull his file. - Pull it up.
he's been shot in the arm... he claims by the assassin.
look, I don't think this is something you should take lightly.
and what does Mr. Aruz want in return for his information?
CTU protection and immunity.
that's a lot to ask, Mr. Bauer.
have you pulled his file yet?
no. - Mr. Hastings,
I know this son of a bitch, and my instinct is telling me that you need to pay attention to this.
I need more than your instinct, Mr. Bauer.
CTU isn't the organization you knew.
okay, fine, but understand this.
if anything happens to President Hassan,
I will be obligated to call President Taylor and tell her that I tried to provide you with this intel, and you ignored it.
what is taking so long for the file?
sorry. I'm still searching through the archives.
Mr. Hastings, I need your answer now.
are you bringing Aruz in or not?
let me talk to him.
I'll put you on speaker.
go ahead.
Mr. Aruz, I'm gonna need some other details to corroborate your story.
the hitter took out two of my guys.
manuel Escobar and Mauricio Tellez.
check with the cops.
we will.
Mr. Bauer, where are you?
1145 West 18th.
I'll send a chopper to pick you up.
the closest helipad to you is... the 12th precinct.
that's five blocks away.
can you get him there,
Mr. Bauer?
Yeah.
I'll have a team there in 20 minutes.
make sure you don't use official channels.
we believe the assassin is monitoring emergency bandwidth.
got it.
gather comm and tactical, tell them we've got a situation.
let's go.
there you are.
now that doesn't suck.
Arlo.
Yeah.
come on. Hastings called an emergency briefing.
and if he ever catches you doing that, you're gonna be out of a job.
be worth it.
I think this might be love.
now.
this is CTU transferring control of drones A31 and 32
to HS aerial command.
Yeah, roger that.
offload confirmed.
all right, we've got a situation.
Cole, I need you to scramble a chopper for a pickup.
Yeah. I haven't finished distributing the new patrol parameters.
this is a priority.
who am I picking up?
someone who claims to have intel about a threat to President Hassan.
how good is the intel?
well, according to Jack Bauer, very.
Jack Bauer?
he's delivering the informant.
who is Jack Bauer?
location's downtown; Chloe's sending you the coordinates.
take a small team with you.
Torres' people are free.
Yes, sir. And I'll need a second team to secure the landing.
one team will be enough. We'll use a drone to protect the ground operation.
Arlo, scramble a drone alongside the chopper.
full spectrum coverage of the landing zone as well as the air corridor.
done.
we're clear. Come on.
dispatch, this is Unit 2354.
go ahead, 2354.
got a plate match on a stolen vehicle.
...03 Pontiac.
sierra, November, Echo, one, five, Charlie, five.
got bullet holes in the windshield and body.
that's him.
Roger that.
what's your location?
vehicle's parked on 18th, just west of Ninth Avenue.
we'll take care of it.
will you?
or am I going to have to step in?
now would be the time to tell me.
Aruz is a dead man, sir.
you have my word.
good.
thank you.
excuse me, Madam President.
president Hassan accepted our counterproposals on inspections.
that is great news.
by the end of this next session, we may have a signed agreement.
it's an extraordinary accomplishment, Allison.
is something wrong?
I was thinking about Henry.
achieving a comprehensive peace agreement with the Islamic Republic was something that he and I talked about years ago.
I wish that he were here to share the moment.
you surprised?
considering his behavior during the divorce, yes, I am surprised.
he went out of his way to hurt you, especially in the press.
he was angry, Ethan.
I sent our daughter to prison.
you refused to cover up a murder.
Olivia was responsible for what happened...
no one else.
still, if the situation had been reversed,
I might've felt the same way as Henry.
sorry if I'm interrupting, but I just talked to Brian Hastings at CTU.
what's going on, Rob?
they have someone who claims he's got information about an assassination plot on Hassan.
how real is the threat?
real enough to loop you in.
this informant came to them through Jack Bauer.
I thought that
Jack was out of all of this. How did he get involved?
as far as I can tell, this informant came to him.
we'll know more once the informant signs an immunity deal, provided you authorize it.
how secure is the venue for the press conference?
very. And I just raised the alert level.
but we need to set up a call to inform Hassan about the threat, ideally before the conference gets started.
we can't tell Hassan.
certainly not before the press conference.
why not?
well, he might scuttle everything, out of concern - for his own safety. - Hassan's a big boy.
he's used to taking risks or he wouldn't be here; you know that.
Plus, if Hassan finds out we knew about this and didn't tell him, then all the trust we've built up over the last year goes out the window, and then he'll pull out of talks.
and frankly, I wouldn't blame him.
I'll think about it.
thank you both.
madam President, I'm telling you, holding this back from Hassan could be disastrous.
I said I'd think about it, Rob.
thank you.
Ethan...
listen... sorry if I went after you a little hard in there.
uh, I was just making my point.
no need to apologize, Rob.
I recommended you to the President because you're not afraid to speak up.
she needs that.
Yeah, well, still, I know I can get carried away; I...
don't worry, kid... I ain't dead yet.
I can handle myself.
even up against you.
Hey, sweetheart, it's me.
Hey, we're almost finished packing. Are you on your way?
something came up. I'm gonna be a little late.
how late?
I think I should meet you at the airport.
is everything okay?
Yeah.
are you sure?
Kim, I promise everything's fine.
well, Teri is so excited that you're coming back with us.
just, uh, let me know when you're on your way.
okay, thanks, sweetheart.
keep your eyes open.
the precinct's two blocks away.
let's cut through here. Come on.
the FAA's cleared a route and informed all relevant agencies that we will be in the air.
good luck.
Aruz's file... It was in a proprietary database.
that's why it took so long.
still, that shouldn't have thrown you... You've been here a month.
almost a month, and I've had to relearn the interface on every major system here; everything's changed.
and you're having trouble adapting, I understand.
but I don't think it's a question of your intelligence.
Thanks.
I think it's ambivalence.
Ambivalence?!
I know the only reason you only took this job was because your husband was downsized.
am I wrong? - No!
I mean, yes.
please, just give me a little more time to get up to speed here.
Mr. Hastings, I need this job.
fair enough.
but I'm all about efficiency, so if your performance doesn't improve, you may want to rethink working here.
now, I trust this has been clarifying.
sure.
if you really wanted to be more efficient, why don't you just say if I don't catch up soon, I'm going to be fired?
your flight path is a straight shot southwest over the river, and the 12th Precinct has confirmed that their helipad is clear and operational. Comm net and satellite coverage of your flight, both legs, and full-time aerial from the drone...
why are you looking at me like that?
like what?
look, I just want to make sure nothing's wrong.
nothing's wrong, like I said.
just be careful, okay?
I will be.
you ready?
Yeah.
you know, maybe she should finally set a date.
she's getting cold feet.
how about you shut up and just focus on your assignment?
come on, Victor!
stay with me.
Victor, stay with me!
stay with...
damn it.
stay with me!
if successful the agreement could be the beginning of a real lasting peace in a long-troubled region.
presidents Taylor and Hassan are scheduled to give their first joint press conference in just a few minutes, and we'll carry that live.
in a moment, Christiane Doumany will have a report on the history of the many failed attempts at a Mideast peace, and why this accord may be different.
it's time to go.
tell your father I'll be right there.
I'll wait until you're done.
he doesn't trust me to be on time.
of course he trusts you.
when did you become such a good liar?
you don't have to defend your father, Dalia.
he can take care of himself.
you look beautiful, Dalia.
and you look handsome.
let's not pretend any more than we have to.
I'm sorry you had to see that.
it's not your fault.
my dear Kayla.
we should go.
Yes.
let her through.
thank you.
I will tell you the same thing that I told him.
unless you want to destroy everything that he's worked for, stay away from him.
excuse me, Ma'am.
president Hassan is on his way.
you're not going to tell him he's being targeted.
madam President, I'm sorry.
you risk destroying in a single day all the... - Rob, you've made your point.
more than once.
and believe me, I don't like keeping this from President Hassan any more than you do.
then tell him.
Mr. President.
ladies.
you've met my chief of staff?
of course.
Hello, Mr. President.
I haven't had the chance to thank you for compromising on the verification issue.
it was the right thing to do.
if you don't mind,
I'd like to brief you both on the format of the press conference.
the Secretary-General will be introducing you both after some brief remarks.
the conference itself shouldn't take any longer than 25 minutes or so.
put your hand on it.
let's go.
we're almost there.
don't move!
got a call that you two are having a problem down here. What's up?
officer, my name is Jack Bauer.
I'm transporting this man on behalf of CTU.
he's an informant vital to national security.
call it in. - Listen to me.
the men that are trying to kill him are monitoring all emergency channels.
do not let him make that call.
shut up and get against the Dumpster.
now!
at least take us into the precinct.
we can verify everything there.
get down, now!
damn it!
I'm going to cover you.
make a run for the door.
you ready? Go! Go!
I'm out of bullets.
Chloe, it's Jack. How far out is the helicopter?
two minutes. Jack, what's wrong?
we're under attack.
I need you to put me in touch with whoever's in command of that unit.
okay. It's Agent Ortiz.
he's the head of field ops.
is there a problem? - Yes.
Mr. Hastings, we have a situation with the pickup.
keep going to the roof. Now.
don't stop for anything.
keep going.
agent Ortiz, you're on with Jack Bauer. - Roger.
what's going on, Mr. Bauer?
we're being pursued by two shooters.
there's no way we're going to make the precinct.
we're in a building on West 21st, three doors in from Ninth Avenue.
we're heading to your position now... stay on the line.
we're looking for an alternate pickup.
copy that.
right there... the roof of that parking structure might work.
can you zoom in closer?
the satellite's refreshing.
it'll take a minute.
I'm moving the drone there now.
there's a parking structure next to the building you're in.
roof looks clear to land.
did you get that, Cole?
Yeah, I see it. Mr. Bauer, looks like you can access that roof from the eighth floor of the building you're in.
how far out are you? - 90 seconds.
copy that.
don't be late.
Victor... Victor, listen to me.
you got to tell me everything you know about the hitter, so I can call it in in case we don't make it.
if I don't make it, I don't care what happens.
get me to CTU.
you always were a son of a bitch.
come on.
come on.
let's go.
stay there.
lock down access points to the roof!
where are the hostiles? - They're dead.
you need to get him out of here. He's losing a lot of blood.
Cole Ortiz. It's an honor to meet you.
thanks for doing this.
look, Hastings wants to debrief you back at CTU.
I'm not going back to CTU. I delivered him, I'm done.
no, Mr. Bauer... - I got a flight to catch.
that's it?
get down!
ortiz, report in.
agent Ortiz?
agent Ortiz, what's your status?
agent Ortiz?
Jack, come in.
Jack, can you hear me?
anyone, come in.
Victor.
Victor, Victor, come on.
stay with me, stay with me.
listen to me.
you don't want to die like this.
do the right thing.
tell me what you know.
the hitter has someone on the inside.
close to Hassan.
give me a name.
give me a name. Give me a name!
Victor...
Victor, who's on the inside?
Victor!
come on.
come on, come on.
no.
he's dead.
no.
the brother revoked my clearance, but I had Hassan reinstate it.
no, I know.
I know I'm behind schedule.
but it'll get done.
tell me what you know.
the hitter has someone on the inside.
Victor Aruz told me right before he died that the assassin's working with someone very close to President Hassan.
someone hacked into the U.N. database.
they downloaded the security protocols, the schematics to the U.N. and Hassan's personal itinerary.
did you get a name?
the computer's owner is listed as Meredith Michelle Reed. She's a reporter.
applied for security clearance at the U.N.
we got a match.
everybody move back!
move back! - Mr. President, you need to come with us.
Mr. President.
I can't believe she's part of this.
if this affair becomes public, it will destroy your credibility and everything that you've worked for.
I just spoke to my brother.
I told him to deny the affair.
the reporter's claims need to be discredited.
CTU needs to continue to think she's my contact on the inside.
we might have the wrong person.
we've been scanning through the traffic cam footage from outside Meredith Reed's apartment building.
this man was going into the service entrance.
what if he went through her apartment and used her laptop to break into the servers?
he hailed a cab when he left.
Jack: See the medallion?
phone the cab company. Find out where it went.
hands in the air now!
against the wall!
Chloe tracked the man in the surveillance photo to a second location.
we didn't think you'd follow through with an investigation.
so you had no choice except to steal weapons from the armory.
would you follow through with an investigation if I'd asked?
I'm not debating this anymore.
you want to waste your time chasing ghosts, knock yourself out.
Hello?
"dana Walsh." I like that.
I told you to stop calling me.
Yeah, I know what you told me, Jenny.
you must be mistaking me for someone else.
that's funny 'cause you sound a lot like this girl I used to know from Rock Springs named Jenny Scott.
Hey, Mike, what's going on?
mind if I come in?
call Captain Ravello.
tell him you're sick, and I'm filling in for you.
now listen, you son of a bitch, there's no way...
what's the matter with you?!
next time I won't miss the bone.
make... the call.
this is Hastings.
tell me you've gotten something out of that reporter you arrested.
no, sir. I'm continuing to press her, but she's maintaining her innocence.
she's a co-conspirator in an assassination plot. Of course she's gonna deny it.
listen, I need to be able to tell the president we're making progress toward averting this threat.
sir, right now our only course is to go after Meredith Reed with the evidence we have in hand.
our top analyst is decrypting a file we obtained from her laptop.
we're hoping it provides the intel we need about the assassin she's working with.
well, it'd better provide something because if your people fail, and President Hassan is killed, this peace process dies with him.
do you understand me?
I understand your concern, Mr. Weiss, but I assure you we're on top of the situation.
I've dispatched tactical personnel to liaise with U.N.security forces and stepped up the alert with NYPD at the perimeter.
fine. I'll have that to tell her at least.
let me know when that file is decrypted.
Dana, you got a minute?
I thought you were on your way to the U.N.
I am. What's the status on that file decryption?
we've identified the cipher. It's a standard Issacs-Adler algorithm.
requires a 12-character decryption key to unlock the data.
the search cycle has identified two characters already.
should have the rest in about 30 or 40 minutes.
why do you ask?
Jack Bauer just caused a big scene with Hastings.
he thinks Meredith Reed may have been framed.
he must have gotten that from Chloe.
I thought that she'd dropped it.
apparently not. She has surveillance of someone exiting Reed's apartment building.
Jack thinks this same person may have planted the encrypted file on Reed's computer.
you believe that?
I'm not sure.
if that evidence was planted, the file you're decrypting is irrelevant at best;
at worst a misdirection.
Cole, I traced the U.N. breach to Reed myself.
of her interrogation all indicate that she's withholding.
I just don't see a frame here.
I hope you're right because Jack's going after this guy on his own.
Hastings sanctioned that?
not exactly.
agent Ortiz? We need to move out, sir.
be careful.
Don'worry.
okay, I'm at the corner of Broadway and West 23rd in Queens.
any location on the suspect?
negative. I talked to the cab driver directly.
all he remembers is dropping the fare at the corner.
nothing shows up in the aerial archives.
Chloe, I need something to go on.
I know. I've been searching for private security cameras in the area.
not all of them are registered. Without the serial numbers, I don't have access to them.
okay, I'm gonna get out and look around on foot.
maybe we'll get lucky. Stay on the line.
it's all right, Mags.
it's gonna be okay, right?
keep your hand on the table where I can see it.
you're not a cop.
everybody, Mikey, or whatever the hell your name is?
talk to me, you son of a bitch!
look, I don't want to hurt you, Jim, or Maggie.
I am just doing my job.
this is the captain calling back.
just say what I told you to say.
please don't make me do anything I don't want to do.
okay?
Yeah.
hello.
Koernig, Captain Ravello. What's up?
uh, yeah, Captain, sorry to drop this on you last-minute.
I just came down with some kind of bug. I got to take a sick leave.
you could have told me earlier, Jim. You're due at the U.N. in 20.
Yeah, I know. It's okay.
I asked Mike Farmer to cover my shift for me.
farmer's already on in the morning.
he said he doesn't mind working a double. I guess he could use the time-and-a-half.
anyway, I already told him he could use the bike that I pulled from the motor pool.
all right, Sergeant. I'll take care of the paperwork.
look, you tell Mike to get his butt to Midtown.
you got that?
Yeah.
you did well.
I did what you wanted me to do, all right, so... 
do what you got to do and leave us alone.
we're not gonna make any trouble for you.
you still there? - Jack, go ahead.
hold on. Hold on.
okay, I got two security cameras overlooking the park, one pointing straight at the corner.
I'm gonna get you the serial numbers.
Hey, man, what you doing?
Chloe, I got to get back to you.
what's up? You lost, man?
actually, I am. I'm looking for a friend of mine.
well, unless you a cop, I suggest look somewhere else,'cause this is our court.
we don't like strangers on it.
I ain't a cop, and I'm not looking for a problem.
my friend was let off on that corner by a cab 20, 25 minutes ago.
I guess you didn't hear what I'm saying, did you?
I've got a hundred bucks; anybody can tell me if they've seen this guy.
anybody?
I seen him.
yo, shut up, Jay!
what was he wearing?
that: green coat, black shirt.
Where'd he go?
that light blue house over there across the street.
I seen him go up the steps to the stoop.
are you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure.
yo, man, what you doing, Jay?!
you don't even know what's going down.
man, I don't know about you, but I got a hundred dollars.
it's your play. Let's go.
man, I'm about to take that hundred dollars. give me ball man
hello.
got a call from one of your neighbors.
Hello, Jack?
what's happening, Jack?
my name is Jack Bauer. working on behalf of CTU.
I'm on an investigation of an assassin which is going to happen in the U.N. Headquarter.
if it's true, drop your weapon - I can't.
the man I'm pursuing killed two people in this house.
if I lower this weapon, I'll be sidelined. That can't happen.
what are you doing? He's down.
son of a bitch is a cop killer.
John, stop! We got to call this in.
not yet we don't.
help me get him in.
so where are we?
as of right now, we've got half the decryption key.
that's all? Can't we accelerate the program?
it's already running at capacity, sir. - Mr. Hastings.
sir, we just found this among Meredith Reed's personal effects.
it's a dedicated key card, United Nations issue.
issued to who? - President Hassan and his family.
it accesses their private residence.
we got her.
Dana Walsh.
ms. Walsh, this is security at Perimeter Gate 9.
you have a visitor.
a visitor?
a Mr. Kevin Wade.
says he's a friend of yours.
ms. Walsh?
tell him I'll be right there.
so this, uh... this CTU-- some kind of government deal, huh?
law enforcement?
ms. Walsh is on her way.
Thanks.
Hey, Dana.
look at you, all pressed and pretty.
I think I like you as a blonde.
what are you doing here?
I thought I told you to leave me alone.
and I told you not to hang up on me, Jenny. - Don't. Don't call me that.
Oh, you-you... you want me to play along?
okay, I'll play along.
but I'm not going to let you pretend that you don't know me.
fine.
you found me, so now what?
you think we're just going to pick up where we left off?
why not?
we had a good thing going.
no. No, we didn't.
I was naive, and I let myself be taken in by you. I am not that person anymore.
yeah?
CTU. Senior Data Analyst.
well, sounds like an important job.
I'm thinking you always were the smart one.
how the hell did you pull this off? What, you steal a dead girl's birth certificate or something?
look, I have money.
not a lot, but some.
if that's what it'll take.
if you really still care about me, you'll leave me alone.
say my name.
what?
if you're gonna beg, I want to hear you say my name.
just like you used to.
Say,"Please, Kevin.
please... Kevin.
there's my bad girl.
damn it! What do you want from me?!
a place to crash for starters.
I'm getting a little tired of living out of the van.
no, that is not gonna happen. - Yeah?
well, now you don't want me...
to tell everyone you work with your little secret now, do you?
you see, I don't want to do that.
come on.
it'll be fun having me around.
it'll be just like old times.
you'll come home... ...and we'll catch up.
fine, fine.
you can stay the night.
I want you out tomorrow.
whatever you say.
do you want my address?
I already got it.
I'm going to ask you again, Ms. Reed, and this time I want an answer.
now we know that this key card was issued to President Hassan and his family at the U.N.
I want to know where you got it.
I'm not saying another word until my attorney gets here.
you're already looking at a life sentence in a federal penitentiary.
so if this plot succeeds and Hassan dies, I promise you the death penalty.
if you give me the name of the assassin, maybe we can cut a deal.
I told you I don't know anything.
you know who you stole his key card from.
I didn't steal it.
then you manufactured it, cloned it somehow!
no. - And used it to gain access to the U.N. security data.
I, I... - Where did you get it?!
tell me! - He gave it to me.
who? Who?!
omar gave it to me. - President Hassan?
why would he do that?
so I could have access to his private residence when he wanted to be alone with me.
you really expect me to believe that you're involved with him?
believe what you want. It's the truth.
this is Hastings.
put me through to Rob Weiss at the U.N.
what are you doing?
I need to speak with President Taylor to get permission to talk with Omar Hassan.
now if there's something you want to say to me, Ms. Reed, now is the time to say it.
I'm sorry, Mr. Hastings.
Mr. Weiss is in a closed session, but they're expecting to break shortly.
all right, just relay the message to have him call me back as soon as he can.
Yes, sir.
looks like you have a bit more time to reconsider your story.
you let me know when you're ready to change it.
Mr. Hastings, I need your help. I've lost contact with Jack.
he called me 15 minutes ago. We got cut off.
I haven't been able to reach him since.
this is your operation, Chloe - yours and Bauer's.
I don't see why this should be my concern.
he could be in some kind of trouble.
you need to send for backup.
even if I wanted to, we don't have the manpower.
I dispatched all field personnel to the U.N. for Hassan's protection.
I watched the interrogation. I heard what Reed said about her affair with Hassan.
if that's true, it supports our idea that she was framed.
and how do you figure that?
because it explains why the biometrics registered her deception, and why the real insider within Hassan's camp chose her to divert our investigation.
reed is lying. There is no affair.
but what if there is?
if President Hassan corroborates Reed's claim, will you consider sending units to find Jack?
all right, fine.
just so you can hear for yourself, I'll have someone alert you when Hassan calls me back.
is that good enough? - No, but it's better than nothing.
that couple you murdered upstairs were friends of mine, dirtbag.
good people.
Mazoni, you can't do this.
no, what I can't do is watch another creep like this walk on a technicality, or because some lawyer didn't file the right papers to the right clerk.
John! - I've seen it happen more times than I can count.
you're new here, Phil. You don't know.
wait till you spend 15 years of your life grinding your teeth in this job.
you talk to me then.
what about that thing he said? About him working with CTU?
did we find credentials on him? - No.
that's because he is a lying piece of garbage.
this was a home invasion robbery.
where nothing was taken.
because we showed up!
look, you got a problem with what I'm doing here, Phil?
then go upstairs and wait till I'm finished.
go. Now!
and remember, you don't call this in until I say so.
you stick to the story. He was resisting arrest. You got that?
you got that?
just, uh... don't kill him.
I'll do my best.
Hey, Farmer, what are you doing here?
Koernig called in sick.
stomach thing. - No kidding?
I talked to him this morning. He was feeling fine.
probably a few too many at lunch.
...continue to receive real-time updates at the U.N.
CTU is confirming the link between the Stinger missile attack and the assassination plot against President Hassan.
in response, we're gonna push the traffic perimeter out another six blocks and close the Queensboro Bridge in both directions until noon tomorrow.
now, roadblock assignments are on pages two and three of your briefing packets.
go ahead and double-check those now.
CTU has also arrested an individual inside the U.N. who we believe is a part of the plot.
hopefully, this will yield some information about the assassin himself.
until then, we have to assume that he could strike at any time and will stop at nothing to achieve his objective.
he's already killed five people that we know of, including two CTU agents.
whoever he is, he's a professional, which means everyone is to be on high alert at all times.
history is happening upstairs, people, and it's on our watch.
our position remains unchanged, Madam President.
we will not allow NATO to transit supplies to Afghanistan through our territory.
what about non-military supplies?
it is our belief that any NATO deployment in the region, military or otherwise, will lead to more extremism, not less.
Mr. President...
uh, my director of Counterterrorism here in New York is requesting to speak to you on the phone.
now?
it's an urgent matter.
it's relating to the reporter who was arrested earlier.
Mr. Weiss will escort you to the conference room.
that is, unless you have any objections.
no, not at all.
this way, Mr. President.
do I have to remind you of our conversation?
Omar, you must deny your involvement with this woman.
she has a name, Farhad.
and I still can't believe that she can be part of this plan.
that should not be your chief concern right now.
if word of this affair gets out, not only is your political career over, but so is the peace process itself.
you know what you have to do.
thank you. - Mr. President.
Hello?
Mr. President, this is Brian Hastings at CTU.
I appreciate you getting back to me.
what can I do for you, Mr. Hastings?
well, sir, I have a matter of some delicacy to discuss with you.
go on. - Thank you, sir.
I know that your time is valuable, so, I'll come right to the point.
I understand Meredith Reed is writing an article on you for the Sunday Magazine.
Yes, that's correct.
do you know of any reason she would be in possession of a key card to your residence at the U.N?
key card?
Yes, sir.
she claims that she got it from you.
and that your relationship with her is...
perhaps more than professional.
Mr. President?
is there anyone listening to our conversation, Mr. Hastings?
are we being recorded?
no, sir. I'm speaking to you on a secure line.
then I will tell you what Ms. Reed said is true.
Omar! What are you doing?!
sir, are you confirming a romantic involvement with Meredith Reed?
Mr. Hastings, I trust your complete discretion in this matter.
and I'm sure you understand the ramification if what I'm telling you becomes public knowledge.
Yes, sir, I understand.
I gave Ms. Reed this key card for reasons I'm sure are clear to you.
I'm telling you all this in the interests of justice because I'm convinced that Ms. Reed is not part of this conspiracy.
excuse me for asking, sir, but are you basing that certainty on anything other than your personal feelings?
no, I suppose not.
I see. Well, thank you for your candor, Mr. President.
I assure you that nothing we discussed will be disclosed from this office.
I appreciate that, Mr. Hastings.
good-bye, then. - Good-bye.
have you any idea what you've done?
the honorable thing.
you said you'd send backup to Jack's location.
I said I'd consider it, and I have.
confirmation of the affair does not prove Reed's innocence.
for all we know, it's a ploy she used to gain access to the U.N. security files, - Hassan's itinerary. - In the meantime, Jack's still missing.
he's not missing. You lost contact.
his phone battery may have died.
or more likely, he's in an area with bad cell reception.
there's pockets of them all over the five boroughs, which you would have known if you were from around here.
fine, if you're not sending someone, I'll go myself.
no, you won't!
your concern for your friend is admirable, but that file we got off Reed's laptop-- it's almost decrypted, and depending what we find, I'm going to need you here. Is that clear?
Yeah.
now, earlier today, you suggested that I speak to you more clearly and directly.
you leave the building, you're fired.
is that clear and direct enough for you?
Hello?
we have a problem.
my brother confessed to the affair.
I don't know if the frame's going to hold.
that's unfortunate.
don't you understand?!
CTU won't believe the file you uploaded to Reed's computer is genuine.
I agree it isn't ideal, but they will still have to act on what they find in any event.
there's no reason to diverge from the plan.
but you need to remain calm and play your part.
how much longer?
I promise you.
your brother will be dead before the hour is out.
don't move!
drop that! Now!
officer, everything I told you before is true.
my name is Jack Bauer. I'm a former federal agent.
he's lying, Phil! Shoot the son of a bitch!
he broke my damn rib! - Contact Chloe O'Brian at CTU.
she'll verify my identity and the threat to the peace conference.
what are you waiting for? Shoot him already!
sit back down, John.
you want to be pointing that gun someplace else.
I said don't move, either of you!
what the hell? I'm your partner!
no, this has gone far enough. I'm calling it in.
you don't want to do that.
come on, Phil. Put the phone down. Let's talk about this.
shut up!
this is Patrolman Phillip Lu. I need to talk to Lieutenant Sell.
the officer upstairs has to be connected to the assassination plot.
Oh, you happy now?! You hearing what he's saying about Koernig?
all I'm saying is that there's a connection. We need to find out what it is.
both of you, shut the hell up!
lieutenant, sir.
I'm at the scene of a double homicide.
one of the victims is a cop, a James Koernig out of Midtown Center.
no, it's definitely murder. Him and his wife.
we got a suspect in custody.
11447 Broadway. Cross street is Astoria.
ask him what Officer Koernig's assignment was today.
please, innocent lives are at stake.
what have you got to lose?
and, sir?
I need a lookup on Koernig's duty assignment.
Yeah, transfer me over.
you screwed up.
what? - Yeah, surprised me, too.
you forgot to upload a Rijndael filter to my system.
without it, I can't break the last encryption layer on the file remnant you gave me.
I'm sorry. I will upload it to a disk for you now.
or I can just do it at your station.
okay, fine.
everything okay?
what do you mean? - I don't know.
it's not like you to make mistakes. You seem a little distracted.
wedding jitters, maybe?
no.
just asking.
and Cole's a nice enough guy.
but I could see how you could start having second thoughts.
I've always been curious to know what you two find to talk about.
drop this, Arlo. I am not in the mood.
Hey, I don't mean anything by it. All I'm saying is that you and the Boy Scout aren't exactly intellectual equals.
or is that what makes him your type?
see now, you and me, for instance, we have a lot in common.
we speak the same language.
mostly techno-jargon granted, but hey, it can always lead to something much deeper.
damn it, Arlo!
that's it. We've got it.
is that what I think it is?
Yes. Finish decrypting your fragment and put it up on the screen.
I've got to go tell Hastings.
I don't care what he's demanding.
tell Ms. Reed's lawyer he's going to have to wait.
we can hold his client for up to 18 hours before formally charging her.
sir?
I have to go.
we've broken the encryption code on Reed's file.
the primary file component's up on screen.
Arlo's waiting for a second piece to finish rendering.
so, what am I looking at?
construction plans for work carried out at the United Nations eight months ago.
the U.N? Are you sure?
positive. Two I-beams were retrofitted to provide structural support for additional interpreters' booths.
there and there.
that looks like the Council Chamber.
it's directly below it.
the decryption's just about complete.
it's loading to the main screen now.
it looks like a schematic for an incendiary.
a bomb. Pulse-detonated, modified to fit between the I-beams.
sir, judging by the size, that's big enough to drop the entire Security Council into the East River.
get me Cole and Manners at the U.N.
all stations!
we're implementing protocols for an immediate evacuation of the United Nations building!
we are Code Red.
I repeat: This is not a drill.
we are Code Red!
Mr. Hastings, you need to consider the possibility that this intel is fake and why they wanted us to find it.
I'm not taking any chances.
sir, I've got Cole and Manners on the line.
gentlemen, we have intel from the decrypted files that an incendiary device has been placed directly below the Council Chamber.
S-Sir, I don't see how that's possible.
this building's been vetted for weeks.
u.n. security have swept the area thoroughly and repeatedly.
then they missed it.
Mr. Manners, you need to implement evacuation protocols immediately.
Cole, I want you on President Hassan, personally.
Yes, sir.
you, you, with me! Let's go!
ladies and gentlemen, forgive the interruption.
your attention, please.
we are evacuating immediately due to a possible bomb threat.
security personnel will be receiving protocol confirmation on designated channels momentarily.
evacuation will proceed out these doors and down to underground parking level B.
please, speak only with your designated handlers.
Omar...- Everything will be fine, Madam President.
madam President, you and Secretary Kanin need to move now.
president Hassan, if you'll follow me.
traffic control, I need route lockdown for northern exodus. All units confirm.
unit 2 in position.- Unit 3 in position.
unit 4 in position.- Unit 5 in position.
where are my wife and daughter?
they're coming down the east stairwell now, sir.
no more than two minutes behind you.
I won't leave without them.
Mr. President, with all due respect, my orders are to evacuate you now.
Omar, I'll wait and go with them.
don't worry. I'll make sure they're safe.
Tarin, get my brother out of here.
all right, evac tunnel B! Move!
yes? - He's in the third car.
the motorcade's coming up the ramps now.
vehicles are in transit. Current location: evac tunnel bravo.
second Avenue teams should have a visual in five minutes.
uncle!
Where's Omar?
he went ahead. We'll take the next car.
is it true there's a bomb?
it's just a precaution, Kayla. Don't worry. Everything's going to be fine.
right this way. - Okay.
let's be quick. Hurry.
the guy who took his place? What was his name?
Thanks.
come on. Get out.
you were right. There is a connection.
sergeant Koernig was on the U.N. security detail.
he called in sick about 45 minutes ago.
he was forced to make that call.
you said someone replaced him?
a patrolman named Mike Farmer from the same unit.
that's your assassin.
officer, you need to let me call CTU, and I need to get to the U.N. immediately.
officer, this is going down now.
you can either stand here and do nothing, or you can help me stop it.
make the call. I'll drive you to the U.N.
thank you.
where the hell you think you're going?
he can't leave! He's a material witness!
Jack, where have you been?
Chloe, please just listen to me.
the assassin killed a police officer and took his place in the U.N. security detail.
I need to alert Agent Ortiz immediately.
okay. I'll patch you through. He's in the middle of evacuating Hassan.
evacuating him? Why?
Hastings' orders.
the evidence in Reed's computer indicated that there's a bomb in the building.
Where's Hassan now?
Hassan's motorcade is heading up the ramps in the parking garage, about to pull out onto Second Avenue.
Chloe, it's Cole. - Hang on. I've got Cole.
agent Ortiz, you're on with Jack Bauer.
what's going on, Jack?
Oh, you need to stop Hassan's car now!
what are you talking about?
the assassin is part of the evacuation detail.
he's posing as an NYPD officer. There is no bomb in the U.N.
they're just trying to lure him out of the building.
did you tell Hastings about this? - We don't have time.
you need to stop the motorcade before it hits the street.
it's too late. Hassan's car just exited the tunnel.
Cole, you need to stop that car or Hassan's a dead man.
whose vehicle is that?
it's Cole, sir.
Cole, what the hell are you doing?
what was that? What happened?
Cole, can you verify? Was Hassan hit?
tell me what you know.
the hitter has someone on the inside.
Victor Aruz told me right before he died that the assassin's working with someone very close to President Hassan.
someone hacked into the U. N. database.
they downloaded the security protocols, the schematics to the U. N.
and Hassan's personal itinerary.
did you get a name?
the computer's owner is listed as
Meredith Michelle Reed. She's a reporter.
applied for security clearance at the U. N.
we got a match.
everybody move back!
move back! Mr. President, you need to come with us.
Mr. President.
I can't believe she's part of this.
if this affair becomes public, it will destroy your credibility and everything that you've worked for.
I just spoke to my brother.
I told him to deny the affair.
the reporter's claims need to be discredited.
CTU needs to continue to think she's my contact on the inside.
we might have the wrong person.
we've been scanning through the traffic cam footage from outside Meredith Reed's apartment building.
this man was going into the service entrance.
what if he went through her apartment and used her laptop to break into the servers?
he hailed a cab when he left.
see the medallion? Phone the cab company.
find out where it went.
hands in the air now! Against the wall!
Chloe tracked the man in the surveillance photo to a second location.
we didn't think you'd follow through with an investigation.
so you had no choice except to steal weapons from the armory.
would you follow through with an investigation if I'd asked?
I'm not debating this anymore.
you want to waste your time chasing ghosts, knock yourself out.
Hello?
Dana Walsh." I like that.
I told you to stop calling me.
Yeah, I know what you told me, Jenny.
you must be mistaking me for someone else.
that's funny 'cause you sound a lot like this girl I used to know from Rock Springs named Jenny Scott.
Hey, Mike, what's going on?
mind if I come in?
Oh, Mikey.
call Captain Ravello.
tell him you're sick, and I'm filling in for you.
now listen, you son of a bitch, there's no way...
what's the matter with you?!
next time I won't miss the bone.
make... the call.
this is Hastings.
tell me you've gotten something out of - that reporter you arrested. - No, sir.
I'm continuing to press her, but she's maintaining her innocence.
she's a co-conspirator in an assassination plot.
of course she's gonna deny it.
listen, I need to be able to tell the president we're making progress toward averting this threat.
sir, right now our only course is to go after Meredith Reed with the evidence we have in hand.
our top analyst is decrypting a file we obtained from her laptop.
we're hoping it provides the intel we need about the assassin she's working with.
well, it'd better provide something because if your people fail, and President Hassan is killed, this peace process dies with him.
do you understand me?
I understand your concern, Mr. Weiss, but I assure you we're on top of the situation.
I've dispatched tactical personnel to liaise with U. N. security forces and stepped up the alert with NYPD at the perimeter.
fine. I'll have that to tell her at least.
let me know when that file is decrypted.
Dana, you got a minute?
I thought you were on your way to the U. N.
I am. What's the status on that file decryption?
we had the cipher.
it's a standard Issacs-Adler algorithm.
requires a 12-character decryption key to unlock the data.
the search cycle has identified two characters already.
should have the rest in about 30 or 40 minutes.
why do you ask?
Jack Bauer just caused a big scene with Hastings.
he thinks Meredith Reed may have been framed.
he must have gotten that from Chloe.
I thought that she'd dropped it.
apparently not.
she has surveillance of someone exiting Reed's apartment building.
Jack thinks this same person may have planted the encrypted file - on Reed's computer. - You believe that?
I'm not sure.
if that evidence was planted, the file you're decrypting is irrelevant at best;
at worst a misdirection.
Cole, I traced the U. N. breach to Reed myself.
the biometric scans of her interrogation all indicate that she's withholding.
I just don't see a frame here.
I hope you're right because Jack's going after this guy on his own.
Hastings sanctioned that?
not exactly.
agent Ortiz? We need to move out, sir.
be careful.
don't worry.
okay, I'm at the corner of Broadway and West 23rd in Queens. Any location on the suspect?
negative. I talked to the cab driver directly.
all he remembers is dropping the fare at the corner.
nothing shows up in the aerial archives.
Chloe, I need something to go on.
I know. I've been searching for private security cameras in the area.
not all of them are registered.
without the serial numbers, I don't have access to them.
okay, I'm gonna get out and look around on foot.
maybe we'll get lucky. Stay on the line.
it's all right, Mags.
it's gonna be okay, right?
keep your hand on the table where I can see it.
who the hell are you? You're not a cop?
how did you manage to fool everybody, Mikey, or whatever the hell your name is?
talk to me, you son of a bitch!
shh-shh-shh.
look,
I don't want to hurt you, Jim, or Maggie.
I am just doing my job.
this is the captain calling back.
just say what I told you to say.
please don't make me do anything I don't want to do.
okay?
Yeah.
hello.
Koernig, Captain Ravello. What's up?
uh, yeah, Captain, sorry to drop this on you last-minute.
I just came down with some kind of bug.
I got to take a sick leave.
you could have told me earlier, Jim.
you're due at the U. N. in 20.
Yeah, I know. It's okay.
I asked Mike Farmer to cover my shift for me.
farmer's already on in the morning.
he said he doesn't mind working a double.
I guess he could use the time-and-a-half.
anyway, I already told him he could use the bike that I pulled from the motor pool.
all right, Sergeant.
I'll take care of the paperwork. Look, you tell Mike to get his butt to Midtown. You got that?
get better, will ya?
Yeah.
you did well.
I did what you wanted me to do, all right, so...
do what you got to do and leave us alone.
we're not gonna make any trouble for you.
you still there?
Jack, go ahead.
hold on. Hold on.
okay, I got two security cameras overlooking the park, one pointing straight at the corner.
I'm gonna get you the serial numbers.
Hey, man, what you doing?
Chloe, I got to get back to you.
what's up? You lost, man?
actually, I am.
I'm looking for a friend of mine.
well, unless you a cop, I suggest you look somewhere else, 'cause this is our court.
we don't like strangers on it.
I ain't a cop, and I'm not looking for a problem.
my friend was let off on that corner by a cab 20, 25 minutes ago.
I guess you didn't hear what I'm saying, did you?
I've got a hundred bucks;
anybody can tell me if they've seen this guy?
anybody?
I seen him.
yo, shut up, Jay!
what was he wearing?
that: green coat, black shirt.
Where'd he go?
that light blue house over there across the street.
I seen him go up the steps to the stoop.
are you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure.
yo, man, what you doing, Jay?!
you don't even know what's going down.
man, I don't know about you, but I got a hundred dollars.
it's your play. Let's go.
man, I'm about to take that hundred dollars.
give me the ball, man.
all right.
Jim!
hello. Jack?
got a call from one of your neighbors.
Jim?
Hello, Jack?
Jack, what's happening?
are you there...?
put the weapon down now. Do it.
my name is Jack Bauer.
I'm working on behalf of CTU.
I'm investigating a threat to the peace conference - at the U. N. - If that's true, drop your weapon.
I can't.
the man I'm pursuing killed two people in this house.
if I lower this weapon, I'll be sidelined.
that can't happen.
what are you doing? He's down.
son of a bitch is a cop killer.
John, stop!
we got to call this in.
not yet we don't.
help me get him in.
man! - Help me get him in!
so where are we?
as of right now, we've got half the decryption key.
that's all?
can't we accelerate the program?
it's already running at capacity, sir.
Mr. Hastings. Sir, we just found this among Meredith Reed's personal effects.
it's a dedicated key card, United Nations issue.
issued to who?
president Hassan and his family.
it accesses their private residence.
we got her.
Dana Walsh.
ms. Walsh, this is security at Perimeter Gate 9. You have a visitor.
a visitor?
a Mr. Kevin Wade.
says he's a friend of yours.
ms. Walsh?
tell him I'll be right there.
so this, uh... this CTU...
some kind of government deal, huh?
law enforcement?
ms. Walsh is on her way.
Thanks.
Hey, Dana.
look at you, all pressed and pretty.
I think I like you as a blonde.
what are you doing here?
I thought I told you to leave me alone.
and I told you not to hang up on me, Jenny.
don't.
don't call me that.
Oh, you-you... you want me to play along?
okay, I'll play along.
but I'm not going to let you pretend that you don't know me.
fine.
you found me, so now what?
you think we're just going to pick up where we left off?
why not?
we had a good thing going.
no.
no, we didn't.
I was naive, and I let myself be taken in by you.
I am not that person - anymore. - Yeah?
CTU.
senior Data Analyst.
well, sounds like an important job.
I'm thinking you always were the smart one.
how the hell did you pull this off?
what, you steal a dead girl's birth certificate or something?
look, I have money.
not a lot, but some.
if that's what it'll take.
if you really still care about me, you'll leave me alone.
say my name.
what?
if you're gonna beg,
I want to hear you say my name.
just like you used to.
say, "Please, Kevin.
please... Kevin.
there's my bad girl.
damn it! What do you want from me?!
a place to crash for starters.
I'm getting a little tired of living out of the van. - No, that is not gonna happen.
yeah? Well, now you don't want me...
to tell everyone you work with your little secret now, do you?
you see, I don't want to do that.
come on.
it'll be fun having me around.
it'll be just like old times.
you'll come home...
and we'll catch up.
fine, fine.
you can stay the night.
I want you out tomorrow.
whatever you say.
do you want my address?
I already got it.
I'm going to ask you again, Ms. Reed, and this time I want an answer.
now we know that this key card was issued to President Hassan and his family at the U. N.
I want to know where you got it.
I'm not saying another word until my attorney gets here.
so if this plot succeeds and Hassan dies,
I promise you the death penalty.
if you give me the name of the assassin, maybe we can cut a deal.
I told you I don't know anything. - You know who you stole his key card from.
I didn't steal it.
then you manufactured it, cloned it somehow!
no.
and used it to gain access - to the U. N. security data. - I, I...
where did you get it?! Tell me!
he gave it to me.
who?
who?!
Omar.
omar gave it to me.
president Hassan?
why would he do that?
so I could have access to his private residence when he wanted to be alone with me.
you really expect me to believe that you're involved with him?
believe what you want. It's the truth.
this is Hastings.
put me through to Rob Weiss at the U. N.
what are you doing?
I need to speak with President Taylor to get permission to talk with Omar Hassan.
now if there's something you want to say to me, Ms. Reed, now is the time to say it.
I'm sorry, Mr. Hastings.
Mr. Weiss is in a closed session, but they're expecting to break shortly.
all right, just relay the message to have him call me back as soon as he can.
Yes, sir.
looks like you have a bit more time to reconsider your story.
you let me know when you're ready to change it.
Mr. Hastings, I need your help.
I've lost contact with Jack.
he called me 15 minutes ago. We got cut off.
I haven't been able to reach him since.
this is your operation, Chloe... yours and Bauer's.
I don't see why this should be my concern.
he could be in some kind of trouble.
you need to send for backup.
even if I wanted to, we don't have the manpower.
I dispatched all field personnel to the U. N.
for Hassan's protection.
I watched the interrogation.
I heard what Reed said about her affair with Hassan.
if that's true, it supports our idea that she was framed.
and how do you figure that?
because it explains why the biometrics registered her deception, and why the real insider within Hassan's camp chose her to divert our investigation.
reed is lying.
there is no affair.
but what if there is?
if President Hassan corroborates Reed's claim, will you consider sending units to find Jack?
all right, fine.
just so you can hear for yourself,
I'll have someone alert you when Hassan calls me back. Is that good enough?
no, but it's better than nothing.
that couple you murdered upstairs were friends of mine, dirtbag.
good people.
Mazoni, you can't do this. - No, what I can't do is watch another creep like this walk on a technicality, or because some lawyer didn't file the right papers to the right clerk.
John! - I've seen it happen more times than I can count.
you're new here, Phil. You don't know.
wait till you spend 15 years of your life grinding your teeth in this job.
you talk to me then.
what about that thing he said?
about him working with CTU? - Did we find credentials on him?
no. That's because he is a lying piece of garbage.
this was a home invasion robbery.
where nothing was taken.
because we showed up!
look, you got a problem with what I'm doing here, Phil?
then go upstairs and wait till I'm finished.
go. Now!
and remember, you don't call this in until I say so.
you stick to the story.
he was resisting arrest.
you got that?
you got that?
just, uh... don't kill him.
I'll do my best.
Hey, Farmer, what are you doing here?
Koernig called in sick.
stomach thing.
no kidding?
I talked to him this morning. He was feeling fine.
probably a few too many at lunch.
continue to receive real-time updates at the U. N.
CTU is confirming the link between the Stinger missile attack and the assassination plot against President Hassan.
in response, we're gonna push the traffic perimeter out another six blocks and close the Queensboro Bridge in both directions until noon tomorrow.
now, roadblock assignments are on pages two and three of your briefing packets.
go ahead and double-check those now.
CTU has also arrested an individual inside the U. N.
who we believe is a part of the plot.
hopefully, this will yield some information about the assassin himself.
until then, we have to assume that he could strike at any time and will stop at nothing to achieve his objective.
he's already killed five people that we know of, including two CTU agents.
whoever he is, he's a professional, which means everyone is to be on high alert at all times.
history is happening upstairs, people, as on our watch.
our position remains unchanged, Madam President.
we will not allow NATO to transit supplies to Afghanistan through our territory.
what about non-military supplies?
it is our belief that any NATO deployment in the region, military or otherwise, will lead to more extremism, not less.
Mr. President...
uh, my director of Counterterrorism here in New York is requesting to speak to you on the phone.
now?
it's an urgent matter.
it's relating to the reporter who was arrested earlier.
Mr. Weiss will escort you to the conference room.
that is, unless you have any objections.
no, not at all.
this way, Mr. President.
do I have to remind you of our conversation?
Omar, you must deny your involvement with this woman.
she has a name, Farhad.
and I still can't believe that she can be part of this plan.
that should not be your chief concern right now.
if word of this affair gets out, not only is your political career over, but so is the peace process itself.
you know what you have to do.
thank you. - Mr. President.
Hello?
Mr. President, this is Brian Hastings at CTU.
I appreciate you getting back to me.
what can I do for you, Mr. Hastings?
well, sir, I have a matter of some delicacy to discuss with you.
go on. - Thank you, sir.
I know that your time is valuable, so, I'll come right to the point.
I understand Meredith Reed is writing an article on you for the Sunday Magazine.
Yes, that's correct.
do you know of any reason she would be in possession of a key card to your residence at the U. N. ?
key card?
Yes, sir.
she claims that she got it from you.
and that your relationship with her is...
perhaps more than professional.
Mr. President?
is there anyone listening to our conversation, Mr. Hastings?
are we being recorded?
no, sir.
I'm speaking to you on a secure line.
then I will tell you what Ms. Reed said is true.
Omar!
what are you doing?!
sir, are you confirming a romantic involvement with Meredith Reed?
Mr. Hastings, I trust your complete discretion in this matter.
and I'm sure you understand the ramification if what I'm telling you becomes public knowledge.
Yes, sir, I understand.
I gave Ms. Reed this key card for reasons I'm sure are clear to you.
I'm telling you all this in the interests of justice because I'm convinced that Ms. Reed is not part of this conspiracy.
excuse me for asking, sir, but are you basing that certainty on anything other than your personal feelings?
no, I suppose not.
I see.
well, thank you for your candor, Mr. President.
I assure you that nothing we discussed will be disclosed from this office.
I appreciate that, Mr. Hastings.
good-bye, then.
good-bye.
have you any idea what you've done?
the honorable thing.
you said you'd send backup to Jack's location.
I said I'd consider it, and I have.
confirmation of the affair does not prove Reed's innocence.
for all we know, it's a ploy she used to gain access to the U. N. security files, Hassan's itinerary.
in the meantime, Jack's still missing.
he's not missing.
you lost contact.
his phone battery may have died.
or more likely, he's in an area with bad cell reception.
there's pockets of them all over the five boroughs, which you would have known if you were from around here.
fine, if you're not sending someone, I'll go myself.
no, you won't!
your concern for your friend is admirable, but that file we got off Reed's laptop...
it's almost decrypted, and depending what we find,
I'm going to need you here.
is that clear? - Yeah.
now, earlier today, you suggested that I speak to yo more clearly and directly.
you leave the building, you're fired.
is that clear and direct enough for you?
Hello?
we have a problem.
my brother confessed to the affair.
I don't know if the frame's going to hold.
that's unfortunate.
don't you understand?!
CTU won't believe the file you uploaded to Reed's computer is genuine.
I agree it isn't ideal, but they will still have to act on what they find in any event.
there's no reason to diverge from the plan.
but you need to remain calm and play your part.
how much longer?
I promise you.
your brother will be dead before the hour is out.
don't move!
drop that! Now!
officer, everything I told you before is true.
my name is Jack Bauer.
I'm a former federal agent. He's lying, Phil!
shoot the son of a bitch!
he broke my damn rib!
contact Chloe O'Brian at CTU.
she'll verify my identity and the threat to the peace conference.
what are you waiting for? Shoot him already!
sit back down, John.
you want to be pointing that gun - someplace else. - I said don't move, either of you!
what the hell? I'm your partner!
no, this has gone far enough.
I'm calling it in.
you don't want to do that.
come on, Phil. Put the phone down.
let's talk about this.
shut up!
this is Patrolman Phillip Lu.
I need to talk to Lieutenant Sell.
the officer upstairs has to be connected to the assassination plot. Oh, you happy now?!
you hearing what he's saying about Koernig? - All I'm saying is that there's a connection
we need to find out what it is.
both of you, shut the hell up!
lieutenant, sir.
I'm at the scene of a double homicide
one of the victims is a cop, a James Koernig out of Midtown Center
no, it's definitely murder.
him and his wife.
we got a suspect in custody 11447 Broadway. Cross street is Astoria.
ask him what Officer Koernig's assignment was today.
please, innocent lives are at stake.
what have you got to lose?
and, sir?
I need a on Koernig's duty assignment.
Yeah, transfer me over.
you screwed up - What?
Yeah, surprised me, too
you forgot to upload a Rijndael filter to my system
without it, I can't break the last encryption layer on the file remnant you gave me
I'm sorry. I will upload it to a disk for you now
or I can just do it at your station.
okay, fine
everything okay?
what do you mean? - I don't know.
it's not like you to make mistakes.
you seem a little distracted
wedding jitters, maybe?
no
just asking
and Cole's a nice enough guy.
but I could see how you could start having second thoughts.
I've always been curious to know what you two - find to talk about. - Drop this, Arlo. I am not in the mood.
Hey, I don't mean anything by it.
all I'm saying is that you and the Boy Scout aren't exactly intellectual equals.
or is that what makes him your type?
see now, you and me, for instance, we have a lot in common.
we speak the same language.
mostly techno-jargon granted, but hey, it can always lead - to something much deeper. - Damn it, Arlo!
that's it.
we've got it.
whoa. Is that what I think it is?
Yes.
finish decrypting your fragment and put it up on the screen.
I've got to go tell Hastings.
I don't care what he's demanding.
tell Ms. Reed's lawyer he's going to have to wait.
we can hold his client for up to 18 hours before formally charging her.
sir? - I have to go.
we've broken the encryption code on Reed's file.
the primary file component's up on screen.
Arlo's waiting for a second piece to finish rendering.
so, what am I looking at?
construction plans for work carried out at the United Nations eight months ago.
the U. N. ? are you sure? - Positive.
two I-beams were retrofitted to provide structural support for additional interpreters' booths.
there and there. - That looks like - the Council Chamber. - It's directly below it.
the decryption's just about complete.
it's loading to the main screen now.
it looks like a schematic for an incendiary.
a bomb.
Pulse-detonated, modified to fit between the I-beams.
sir, judging by the size, that's big enough to drop the entire Security Council into the East River.
get me Cole and Manners at the U. N.
all stations!
we're implementing protocols for an immediate evacuation of the United Nations building!
we are Code Red.
I repeat: This is not a drill.
we are Code Red!
Mr. Hastings, you need to consider the possibility that this intel is fake and why they wanted us to find it.
I'm not taking any chances.
sir, I've got Cole and Manners on the line.
gentlemen, we have intel from the decrypted files that an incendiary device has been placed directly below the Council Chamber.
s... Sir, I don't see how that's possible.
this building's been vetted for weeks.
u. N. security have swept the area thoroughly and repeatedly.
then they missed it.
Mr. Manners, you need to implement evacuation protocols immediately.
Cole, I want you on President Hassan, personally.
Yes, sir.
Hey! You, you, with me! Let's go!
ladies and gentlemen, forgive the interruption.
your attention, please.
we are evacuating immediately due to a possible bomb threat.
security personnel will be receiving protocol confirmation on designated channels momentarily.
evacuation will proceed out these doors and down to underground parking level B.
please, speak only with your designated handlers. - Omar...
everything will be fine, Madam President.
madam President, you and Secretary Kanin need to move now.
president Hassan, if you'll follow me.
traffic control, I need route lockdown for northern exodus.
all units confirm.
unit 2 in position.
unit 3 in position.
unit 4 in position.
unit 5 in position.
move out! Move out!
where are my wife and daughter?
they're coming down the east stairwell now, sir.
no more than two minutes behind you.
I won't leave without them.
Mr. President, with all due respect, my orders are to evacuate you now.
Omar, I'll wait and go with them. Don't worry.
I'll make sure they're safe.
Tarin, get my brother out of here.
all right, evac tunnel B! Move!
yes?
he's in the third car.
the motorcade's coming up the ramps now.
vehicles are in transit.
current location: evac tunnel bravo.
second Avenue teams should have a visual in five minutes.
uncle! - Where's Omar?
he went ahead. We'll take the next car.
is it true there's a bomb?
it's just a precaution, Kayla. Don't worry.
everything's going to be fine.
right this way.
okay. Let's be quick.
hurry.
the guy who took his place?
what was his name?
Mike Farmer.
Thanks.
come on. Get out.
you were right.
there is a connection.
sergeant Koernig was on the U. N. security detail.
he called in sick about 45 minutes ago.
he was forced to make that call.
you said someone replaced him?
a patrolman named Mike Farmer from the same unit.
that's your assassin.
officer, you need to let me call CTU, and I need to get to the U. N. immediately.
officer, this is going down now.
you can either stand here and do nothing, or you can help me stop it.
make the call. I'll drive you to the U. N.
thank you.
where the hell you think you're going?
he can't leave!
he's a material witness!
Jack, where have you been?
Chloe, please just listen to me.
the assassin killed a police officer and took his place in the U. N. security detail.
I need to alert Agent Ortiz immediately.
okay. I'll patch you through.
he's in the middle of evacuating Hassan.
evacuating him? Why?
Hastings' orders. The evidence in Reed's computer indicated that there's a bomb in the building.
Where's Hassan now?
Hassan's motorcade is heading up the ramps in the parking garage, about to pull out onto Second Avenue.
Chloe, it's Cole. - Hang on. I've got Cole.
agent Ortiz, you're on with Jack Bauer.
what's going on, Jack?
Oh, you need to stop Hassan's car now!
what are you talking about?
the assassin is part of the evacuation detail.
he's posing as an NYPD officer.
there is no bomb in the U. N.
they're just trying to lure him out of the building.
did you tell Hastings about this?
we don't have time. You need to stop the motorcade before it hits the street.
it's too late. Hassan's car just exited the tunnel.
Cole, you need to stop that car or Hassan's a dead man.
Cole?
whose vehicle is that?
it's Cole, sir.
Cole, what the hell are you doing?
Cole!
Cole!
what was that?
what happened?
Cole, can you verify? Was Hassan hit?
Cole!
tell me what you know.
the hitter has someone on the inside.
Victor Aruz told me right before he died
that the assassin's working with someone very close to president Hassan.
someone hacked into the U. N. Database
and downloaded security protocols,
the schematics to the U. N, and Hassan's personal itinerary.
did you get a name?
the computer's owner is listed as
Meredith Michelle Reed. She's a reporter.
applied for security clearance at the U. N.
we got a match.
move back!
Mr. President, you need to come with us.
Mr. President.
I can't believe she's part of this.
if this affair becomes public, it will destroy your credibility
and everything that you've worked for.
I just spoke to my brother.
I told him to deny the affair.
the reporter's claims need to be discredited.
CTU needs to continue to think she's my contact on the inside.
we might have the wrong person.
we've been scanning through the traffic cam footage
from outside Meredith Reed's apartment building.
this man was going into the service entrance.
what if he went through her apartment
and used her laptop to break into the servers?
he hailed a cab when he left.
see the medallion? Call the cab company.
find out where it went.
hands in the air now!
against the wall!
Chloe tracked the man in the surveillance photo to a second location.
we didn't think you'd follow through with an investigation.
so you had no choice except to steal weapons from the armory.
would you have followed through with this investigation if I'd ask?
I'm not debating this anymore.
you want to waste your time chasing ghosts, knock yourself out.
Hello?
Dana walsh," I like that.
I told you to stop calling me.
Yeah, I know what you told me, jenny.
you must be mistaking me for someone else.
that's funny 'cause you sound a lot like this girl
I used to know from rock springs named jenny scott.
Hey, Mike, What's going on? - Mind if I come in?
Oh, mikey.
call captain ravello.
tell him you're sick and I'm filling in for you.
now listen, you son of a bitch, there's no way...
what's the matter with you?!
next time I won't miss the bone.
make the call.
this is hastings.
tell me you've gotten something out of
that reporter you arrested.
no, sir, i'm continuing to press her,
but she's maintaining her innocence.
she's a co-conspirator in an assassination plot.
of course she's gonna deny it.
listen, I need to tell the president we're making progress
toward averting this threat.
sir, right now our only course is
to go after meredith reed with the evidence we have in hand.
our top analyst is decrypting a file
we obtained from her laptop.
we're hoping it provides the intel we need
about the assassin she's working with.
well, it better provide something
because if your people failed , and president Hasson is killed,
his peace process dies with him.
do you understand me?
I understand your concern, Mr. Weiss.
but I assure you we're on top of the situation.
I've dispatched tactical personnel
to liaise with U. N. Security forces
and stepped up the alert with NYpd at the perimeter.
fine. I'll have that to tell her at least.
let me know when that file is decrypted.
Dana, you got a minute?
I thought you were on your way to the U. N.
I am. What's the status on that file decryption?
we I. D.'d the cipher.
it's a standard issacs-adler algorithm.
requires a 12-character decryption key to unlock the data.
the search cycle has identified two characters already.
should have the rest in 30 or 40 minutes.
why do you ask?
Jack Bauer just caused a big scene with Hastings.
he thinks meredith reed may have been framed.
he must have gotten that from chloe.
I thought that she'd dropped it.
apparently not.
she has surveillance of someone exiting
Reed's apartment building.
Jack thinks this same person
may have planted the encrypted file On reed's computer.
you believe that?
I'm not sure.
if that evidence was planted,
the file you're decrypting is irrelevant at best,
and at worst a misdirection.
Cole, I traced the U. N. Breach to reed myself.
the biometric scans of her interrogation
all indicate that she's withholding.
I just don't see a frame here.
I hope you're right
because Jack's going after this guy on his own.
Hastings assigned that?
not exactly.
agent ortiz? We need to move out, sir.
be careful.- Don't worry.
okay, I'm at the corner of broadway and west 23rd in queens.
any location on the suspect?
negative. I talked to the cab driver directly.
all he remembers is dropping the fare at the corner.
nothing shows up in the aerial archives.
Chloe, I need something to go on.
I know. I've been searching for private security cameras in the area.
not all of them are registered.
without the serial numbers, I don't have access to them.
okay, I'm gonna get out and look around on foot.
maybe we'll get lucky. Stay on the line.
it's all right, Mags.
it's gonna be okay, right?
keep your hand on the table where I can see it.
who the hell are you?
you're not a cop.
how did you manage to fool everybody, Mikey,
or whatever the hell your name is?
talk to me,
you son of a bitch!
No!
look, i don't want to hurt you, Jim, or maggie.
I am just doing my job.
this is the captain calling back
just say what I told you to say.
please don't make me do anything I don't want to do. okay?
Yeah.
hello.
Koernig, captain Ravello.
what's up?
uh, yeah, captain,
sorry to drop this on you last-minute.
I just came down with some kind of bug.
I got to take a sick leave.
you could have told me earlier，Jim.
you're due at the U. N. in 20.
Yeah, I know. It's okay.
I asked Mike Farmer to cover my shift for me.
farmer's already on in the morning.
he said he doesn't mind working a double.
I guess he could use the time-and-a-half.
anyway, I already told him he could use the bike
that I pulled from the motor pool.
all right, sergeant.
I'll take care of the paperwork. Look, you tell Mike
to get his butt to midtown. You got that?
get better, will ya?
Yeah.
you did well
I did what you wanted me to do, all right, so...
do what you got to do
and leave us alone.
we're not gonna make any trouble for you.
you still there? -Jack, go ahead.
hold on. Hold on.
okay, I got two security cameras overlooking
the park, one pointing straight at the corner.
I'm gonna get you the serial numbers.
Hey, man, what you doing?
Chloe, I got to get back to you.
what's up? You lost, man?
actually, I am.
I'm looking for a friend of mine.
well, unless you a cop, I suggest look somewhere else
cuz this is our court.
we don't like strangers on it.
I ain't a cop and I'm not looking for a problem.
my friend was let off on that corner
by a cab 20-25 minutes ago.
I guess you didn't hear what I'm saying, did you?
I've got a hundred bucks
anybody can tell me who have seen this guy?
anybody?
I seen him.
yo, shut up, Jay!
what was he wearing?
green coat, black shirt.
where did he go?
that light blue house over there across the street
I seen him go upstairs that house - Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure.
yo, man, what you doing, Jay?!
you don't even know what's going down.
man, I don't know about you, but I got a hundred dollars.
it's your play. Let's go.
man, I'm about to take that hundred dollars.
give me the ball, man.
Jim!
Jack.
got a call from one of your neighbors.
Jim?
Hello, Jack?
Jack, what's happening?
are you there...?
put the weapon down now. Do it.
my name is Jack Bauer.
I'm working on behalf of CTU.
I'm investigating a threat to the peace conference at the UN.
if that's true, drop your weapon.
I can't.
the man I'm pursuing killed two people in this house.
if I lower this weapon, I'll be sidelined.
that can't happen.
what are you doing? He's down.
son of a bitch is a cop killer.
John, stop!
we got to call this in.
not yet we don't.
help me get him in!
come on! help me get him in!
so where are we?
as of right now, we've got half the decryption key.
at's all?
can't we accelerate the program?
it's already running at capacity, sir.
Mr. Hastings. Sir, we just found this
among Meredith Reed's personal effects.
it's a dedicated key card,
united Nations issue.
issued to who?
president Hassan and his family.
it accesses their private residence.
we got her.
Dana Walsh.
ms. Walsh, this is security
at perimeter gate 9. You have a visitor.
a visitor?
a Mr. Kevin Wade.
says he's a friend of yours.
ms. Walsh?
tell him I'll be right there.
so this, uh... this CTU
some kind of government deal, huh?
law enforcement?
ms. Walsh is on her way
Thanks.
Hey, Dana. Look at you, all pressed and pretty.
I think I like you as a blonde.
what are you doing here? I thought I told you to leave me alone.
and I told you not to hang up on me, Jenny.
don't call me that name.
Oh, you-you...you want me to play along?
okay, I'll play along.
but I'm not going to let you pretend that you don't know me.
fine.
you found me, so now what?
you think we're just going to pick up where we left off?
why not?
we had a good thing going.
no.
no, we didn't.
I was naive, and I let myself be taken in by you.
I am not that person anymore. - Yeah?
CTU.
senior Data Analyst.
well, sounds like an important job.
I'm thinking you always were the smart one.
how the hell did you pull this off?
what, you steal a dead girl's birth certificate or something?
look, I have money.
not a lot, but some.
if that's what it'll take.
if you really still care about me, you'll leave me alone.
say my name.
what?
if you're gonna beg,
I want to hear you say my name.
just like you used to.
Kevin.
say, "Please, Kevin.
please... Kevin.
there's my bad girl.
damn it! What do you want from me?!
a place to crash for starters.
I'm getting a little tired of living out of the van.
no, that is not gonna happen.
yeah? Well, now you don't want me...
to tell everyone you work with your little secret now, do you?
you see, I don't want to do that.
come on.
it'll be fun having me around.
it'll be just like old times.
you'll come home...
...and we'll catch up.
fine, fine.
you can stay the night.
I want you out tomorrow.
whatever you say.
do you want my address?
I already got it.
I'm going to ask you again, Ms. Reed, and this time I want an answer.
now we know that this key card was issued to President Hassan and his family at the U. N.
I want to know where you got it.
I'm not saying another word until my attorney gets here.
you're already looking at a life sentence in a federal penitentiary.
so if this plot succeeds and Hassan dies,
I promise you the death penalty.
if you give me the name of the assassin, maybe we can cut a deal.
I told you I don't know anything.
you know who you stole his key card from.
I didn't steal it.
then you manufactured it, cloned it somehow!
no.
and used it to gain access - to the U. N. security data. I, I...
where did you get it?! Tell me!
he gave it to me.
who?
who?!
Omar.
omar gave it to me.
president Hassan?
why would he do that?
so I could have access to his private residence when he wanted to be alone with me.
you really expect me to believe that you're involved with him?
believe what you want. It's the truth.
this is Hastings.
put me through to Rob Weiss at the U. N.
what are you doing?
I need to speak with President Taylor to get permission to talk with Omar Hassan.
now if there's something you want to say to me, Ms. Reed, now is the time to say it.
I'm sorry, Mr. Hastings.
Mr. Weiss is in a closed session, but they're expecting to break shortly.
all right, just relay the message to have him call me back as soon as he can.
Yes, sir.
looks like you have a bit more time to reconsider your story.
you let me know when you're ready to change it.
Mr. Hastings, I need your help.
I've lost contact with Jack.
he called me 15 minutes ago.
we got cut off.
I haven't been able to reach him since.
this is your operation, Chloe-- yours and Bauer's.
I don't see why this should be my concern.
he could be in some kind of trouble.
you need to send for backup.
even if I wanted to, we don't have the manpower.
I dispatched all field personnel to the U. N.
for Hassan's protection.
I watched the interrogation.
I heard what Reed said about her affair with Hassan.
if that's true, it supports our idea that she was framed.
and how do you figure that?
because it explains why the biometrics registered her deception, and why the real insider within Hassan's camp chose her to divert our investigation.
reed is lying.
there is no affair.
but what if there is?
if President Hassan corroborates Reed's claim, will you consider sending units to find Jack?
all right, fine.
just so you can hear for yourself,
I'll have someone alert you when Hassan calls me back. Is that good enough?
no, but it's better than nothing.
that couple you murdered upstairs were friends of mine, dirtbag.
good people.
Mazoni, you can't do this.
no, what I can't do is watch another creep like this walk on a technicality, or because some lawyer didn't file the right papers to the right clerk.
John. - I've seen it happen more times than I can count.
you're new here, Phil. You don't know.
wait till you spend 15 years of your life grinding your teeth in this job.
you talk to me then.
what about that thing he said?
about him working with CTU.
did we find credentials on him?
no - That's because he is a lying piece of garbage.
this was a home invasion robbery.
where nothing was taken.
because we showed up!
look, you got a problem with what I'm doing here, Phil?
then go upstairs and wait till I'm finished.
go. Now.
and remember, you don't call this in until I say you so.
you stick to the story.
he was resisting arrest.
you got that?
you got that?
just, uh...
don't kill him.
I'll do my best.
Hey, Farmer, what are you doing here?
Koernig called in sick, stomach thing
no kidding?
I talked to him this morning. He was feeling fine.
probably a few too many at lunch.
continue to receive real-time updates here at the UN
CTU is confirming the link between the stinger missile attack and the assassination plot against president Hassan.
in response, we're gonna push the traffic perimeter out another six blocks and close the queensboro bridge in both directions until noon tomorrow.
now, roadblock assignments are on pages two and three of your briefing packets.
go ahead and double-check those now.
CTU has also arrested an individual inside the U. N.
who we believe is a part of the plot.
hopefully, this will yield some information about the assassin himself.
until then, we have to assume that he could strike at any time and will stop at nothing to achieve his objective.
he's already killed five people that we know of, including two CTU agents.
whoever he is, he's a professional, which means everyone is to be on high alert at all times.
history is happening upstairs, people.
and it's on our watch.
our position remains unchanged, Madam President.
we will not allow Nato to transit supplies to Afghanistan through our territory.
what about non-military supplies?
it is our belief that any Nato deployment in the region, military or otherwise, will lead to more extremism, not less.
Mr. President...
uh, my director of counterterrorism here in new york is requesting to speak to you on the phone.
now?
it's relating to the reporter who was arrested earlier.
Mr. Weiss will escort you to the conference room.
that is unless you have any objections.
no, not at all.
this way, Mr. President.
do I have to remind you of our conversation?
you must deny your involvement with this one.
she has a name, Farhad.
and I still can't believe that she can be part of this plan.
that should not be your chief concern right now.
if word of this affair gets out, not only is your political career over, but so is the peace process itself.
you know what you have to do.
thank you. - Mr. President.
Hello?
Mr. President, this is Brian Hastings at CTU.
I appreciate you getting back to me.
what can I do for you, Mr. Hastings?
well, sir, I have a matter of some delicacy to discuss with you.
go on. - Thank you, sir.
I know that your time is valuable, so, I'll come right to the point.
I understand Meredith Reed is writing an article on you for the Sunday magazine.
Yes, that's correct.
do you know of any reason she would be in possession of a key card to your residence at the U. N?
key card?
Yes, sir.
she claims that she got it from you, and that your relationship with her is perhaps more than profession
Mr. President?
is there anyone listening to our conversation, Mr. Hastings?
are we being recorded?
no, sir.
I'm speaking to you on a secure line.
then I will tell you what Ms. Reed said is true.
Omar!
what are you doing?!
sir, are you confirming a romantic involvement with Meredith Reed?
Mr. Hastings, I trust your complete discretion in this matter.
and I'm sure you understand the ramification if what I'm telling you becomes public knowledge.
Yes, sir, I understand.
I gave Ms. Reed this key card for reasons I'm sure are clear to you.
I'm telling you all this in the interests of justice because I'm convinced that Ms. Reed is not part of this conspiracy.
excuse me for asking, sir,
but are you basing that certainty on anything other than your personal feelings?
no, I suppose not.
I see.
well, thank you for your candor, Mr. President.
I assure you that nothing we discussed will be disclosed out of this office.
I appreciate that, Mr. Hastings.
good-bye.
have you any idea what you've done?
the honorable thing.
you said you'd send backup to Jack's location.
I said I'd consider it and I have.
confirmation of the affair does not prove Reed's innocence.
for all we know, it's a ploy she used to gain access
to the U. N. Security files, Hassan's itinerary.
in the meantime, jack's still missing.
he's not missing.
you lost contact.
his phone battery may have died.
or more likely, he's in an area with bad cell reception.
there's pockets of them all over the five boroughs,
which you would have known if you were from around here.
fine, if you're not sending someone, I'll go myself.
no, you won't!
you concern for your friend is admirable,
but that file we got off Reed's laptop
it's almost decrypted, and depending what we find, - We need you here, is that clear? - Yeah.
now, earlier today, you suggested that I speak to you more clear and direct.
you leave the building, you're fired.
is that clear and direct enough for you?
Hello?
we have a problem, my brother confessed to frame.
I don't know if the frame's going to hold.
that's unfortunate.
don't you understand?
CTU won't believe the file you uploaded to Reed's computer is genuine.
I agree it isn't ideal,
but they will still have to act on what they find in any event
there's no reason to diverge from the plan.
but you need to remain calm and play your part.
how much longer?
I promise you.
your brother will be died before the hour is out.
don't move!
drop that! now!
officer, everything I told you before is true.
my name is Jack Bauer.
I'm a former federal agent. - He's lying, phil!
shoot the son of a bitch!
he broke my damn rib!
contact o' brian at CTU,
she'll verify my identity and the threat to the peace conference
what are you waiting for? Shoot him already!
sit back down, John.
you want to be pointing that gun someplace else.
I said don't move, either of you!
what the hell? I'm your partner!
no, this has gone far enough.
I'm calling it in.
you don't want to do that.
come on, phil. Put the phone down.
let's talk about this.
shut up!
this is patrolman phillip lu.
I need to talk to lieutenant sell.
the officer upstairs has to be connected to the assassination plot.
Oh, you happy now?!
you hearing what he's saying about koernig?
all I'm saying is that there's a connection.
we need to find out what it is.
both of you, shut the hell up!
lieutenant, sir.
I'm at the scene of a double homicide, One of the victims is a cop,
a James Koernig out of midtown center.
no, it's definitely murder.
him and his wife.
we got a suspect in custody.
11447 broadway. Cross street is astoria.
ask him what officer koernig's assignment was today.
please, innocent lives are at stake.
what have you got to lose
and, sir?
I need a look-up on koernig's duty assignment.
Yeah, transfer me over.
you screwed up. - What?
Yeah, surprised me, too.
you forgot to upload a rijndael filter to my system.
without it I can't break the last encryption layer
on the file remnant you gave me.
I'm sorry, I will upload it to a disk for you now.
or I can just do it at your station.
okay, fine.
everything okay?
what do you mean? - I don't know.
it's not like you to make mistakes.
you seem a little distracted.
wedding jitters maybe?
no.
and cole's a nice enough guy.
but I could see how you could start having second thoughts.
I've always been curious to know what you two
find to talk about. Drop this, arlo. I am not in the mood.
all I'm saying is that you and the boy scout
aren't exactly intellectual equals.
or is that what makes him your type?
see now, you and me, for instance,
we have a lot in common.
we speak the same language.
mostly techno-jargon granted, but hey, it can always lead
to something much deeper.
damn it, arlo!
that's it.
we've got it.
whoa. Is that what I think it is?
Yes.
finish decrypting your fragment and put it up on the screen.
I've gotta go tell hastings.
I don't care what he's demanding.
tell ms. Reed's lawyer he's going to have to wait.
we can hold his client for up to 18 hours
before formally charging her.
sir? I have to go.
we've broken the encryption code on reed's file.
the primary file components up on screen.
Arlo's waiting for a second piece to finish rendering.
so, what am I looking at?
construction plans for work carried out
at the united nations eight months ago.
the U. N? Are you sure? - Positive.
two I-beams were retrofitted to provide structural support for additional interpreters' booths.
there and there. That looks like he council chamber.
it's directly below it.
it's loading to the main screen now.
it looks like a schematic for an incendiary.
a bomb.
Pulse-detonated,
modified to fit between the I-beams.
sir, judging by the size, that's big enough
to drop the entire security council
into the east river.
get me cole and manners at the U. N.
all stations!
we're implementing protocols
for an immediate evacuation of the united nations building!
we are code red.
this is not a drill.
we are code red!
Mr. Hastings, you need to consider
the possibility that this intel is fake
and why they wanted us to find it.
I'm not taking any chances.
sir, I've got Cole and Manners on the line.
gentlemen. We have intel from the decrypted files
that an incendiary device has been placed directly below the council chamber.
sir, I don't see how that's possible.
this building's been vetted for weeks.
u. N. Security have swept the area thoroughly and repeatedly.
then they missed it.
Mr. Manners, you need to implement evacuation protocols immediately.
Cole, I want you on president Hassan, personally.
Yes, sir.
Hey! You, you, with me! Let's go!
ladies and gentlemen, forgive the interruption.
your attention, please.
we are evacuating immediately due to a possible bomb threat.
security personnel will be receiving
protocol confirmation on designated channels momentarily.
evacuation will proceed out these doors
and down to underground parking level B.
please, speak only with your designated handlers.
Omar...
everything will be fine, madam president.
madam president, you and secretary Kanin need to move now
president Hassan, if you'll follow me.
traffic control, I need route lockdown for northern exodus.
all units confirm.
unit 2 in position.
unit 3 in position.
unit 4 in position.
unit 5 in position.
where are my wife and daughter?
they're coming down the east stairwell now, sir.
no more than two minutes behind you.
I won't leave without them.
Mr. President, with all due respect, my orders are to evacuate you now.
Omar, I'll wait and go with them. Don't worry.
I'll make sure they're safe.
Tarin, get my brother out of here.
all right, evac tunnel B! Move!
yes?
he's in the third car.
the motorcade's coming up the ramps now.
vehicles are in transit.
evac tunnel bravo.
second avenue teams should have a visual in five minutes.
uncle! - Where's Omar?
he went ahead. We'll take the next car.
is it true there's a bomb?
it's just a precaution, Kayla. Don't worry.
everything's going to be fine.
right this way.
let's be quick.
hurry.
the guy who took his place?
what was his name?
Mike Farmer.
Thanks.
come on. Get out.
you were right.
there is a connection.
sergeant Koernig was on the U. N. Security detail.
he called in sick about 45 minutes ago.
he was forced to make that call.
you said someone replaced him?
a patrolman named Mike Farmer from the same unit.
that's your assassin.
officer, you need to let me call CTU,
and I need to get to the U. N. immediately.
officer, this is going down now.
you can either stand here and do nothing
or you can help me stop it.
make the call. I'll drive you to the U. N.
thank you.
where the hell you think you're going?
he can't leave!
he's a material witness!
Jack, where have you been?
Chloe, please just listen to me.
the assassin killed a police officer
and took his place in the U. N. Security detail.
I need to alert agent Ortiz immediately.
okay. I'll patch you through.
he's in the middle of evacuating Hassan.
evacuating him? Why?
Hastings' orders.
the evidence in Reed's computer indicated that there's a bomb in the building.
Where's Hassan now?
Hassan's motorcade is heading up the ramps In the parking garage, about to pull out onto second avenue.
Chloe, it's Cole. - Hang on. I've got cole.
agent ortiz, you're on with Jack Bauer.
what's going on, Jack?
you need to stop Hassan's car now!
what are you talking about?
the assassin is part of the evacuation detail.
he's posing as an NYPD officer.
there is no bomb in the U. N.
they're just trying to lure him out of the building.
did you tell Hastings about this?
we don't have time.
you need to stop the motorcade before it hits the street.
it's too late. Hassan's car just exited the tunnel.
Cole, you need to stop that car or Hassan's a dead man.
Cole?
whose vehicle is that?
it's Cole, sir.
Cole,
what the hell are you doing?
Cole!
Cole!
what was that?
what happend?
Cole, can you verify? Was Hassan hit?
Cole!
sir, we just found this among Meredith Reed's personal effects.
it's a dedicated key card, United Nations issue.
to who? - President Hassan and his family.
it accesses their private residence.
we got her.
I want to know where you got it.
omar gave it to me.
I gave Miss Reed this key card for reasons I'm sure are clear to you.
sir, are you confirming a romantic involvement with Meredith Reed?
I trust your complete discretion in this matter.
we have a problem.
my brother confessed to the affair.
I don't know if the frame's going to hold.
there is no reason to diverge from the plan.
how much longer?
your brother will be dead before the hour is out.
what are you doing here?
I thought I told you to leave me alone.
CTU.
senior Data Analyst.
well, sounds like an important job.
damn it. What do you want from me?!
a place to crash for starters.
you can stay the night.
I want you out tomorrow.
ladies and gentlemen, we're evacuating immediately, due to a possible bomb threat.
madam President, you and Secretary Kanin need to move now.
president Hassan, if you'll follow me.
yes?
he's in the third car.
the motorcade's coming up the ramps now.
officer, this is going down now.
you can either stand here and do nothing or you can help me stop it.
Cole, you need to stop Hassan's car now.
the assassin is part of the evacuation detail.
there is no bomb in the UN.
it's too late. Hassan's car just exited the tunnel.
Cole, you need to stop that car, or Hassan's a dead man.
Cole!
what was that?! What happened?
this is a damn disaster, Brian.
what do you mean, you don't know what happened?
how is Hassan? Is he all right?
we don't know yet, Madam President.
it appears the bomb threat at the UN was a hoax designed to get him out of the building.
it "appears"?
an IED was planted on Hassan's evacuation route.
and you drove him right into it!
one of our agents detected the ambush, tried to head him off just as the bomb exploded.
well, you better pray he got there in time.
security there! Now!
stand down! I'm with CTU.
sir, we need to move you to another vehicle now.
sir, you do not want to stay here.
go, go, go.
move! Move!
Cole?
Yeah.
thank God you're okay.
I got lucky.
Hassan escaped the blast; he's fine.
he's heading toward CTU, - eastbound on 48th Street in a black SUV. - Got him.
Mr. Hastings, here.
Hassan, he's safe.
Dana, the assassin was posing as a part of the security team.
I know. We got the info from Chloe.
the police are putting up a three-bock cordon now.
Cole?
Cole? Cole, are you there?
I've got the suspect. He's dressed as a cop.
entering a white low-rise north of the UN.
call it in! I'm in pursuit!
Chloe, I need to put out a priority APB.
move, move, move!
what is it now?
they've got a lead on the assassin.
4722 East 47th Street.
I'm gonna need my weapon.
your bag's right behind my seat.
east 47th Street... that's just above the UN.
you're gonna need to turn now.
now! Now!
un 4, come in.
un 4, this is CTU 2. Come in, please.
I'm sorry. I can't reach him. - Try again.
that's my husband in that car up there. - They're not answering.
I have to go to him. - Ma'am, please, you need to remain in the car.
Dalia! Stay calm.
I'll try another number.
where are you?
Yes, we're safe.
Dalia, Kayla, and myself.
I need to know about my brother.
he's alive.
he survived.
Farhad, how is he?
he's alive.
God is with us.
can you tell me what happened?
a car in the motorcade swerved in front of him.
they're locking down the entire area.
what would you suggest we do?
it's over.
get out now.
it can't be long before they realize it's you.
Farhad?
sir, please stay in the car!
please, sir.
sir, I need you to get back in the car.
Oh!
get on your knees.
slide your weapon back to me.
slowly...
slow...
now... you're going to walk me out of here.
call in.
say the southwest corner is clear.
tell them to move the search team to the northeast.
do it.
you want to live?
make the call.
this is Cole Ortiz in the southwest corner of the building.
I'm in pursuit of the assassin.
he's with me now.
you okay?
you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.
okay.
son of a bitch.
Mr. President, Brian Hastings.
we spoke on the phone.
we're glad you're here. Please follow me.
is my family here?
no, sir. We'll try and get - you all together shortly. - Are they all right?
your wife and daughter are fine.
and my brother?
was he hurt?
no, sir.
Mr. President...
it appears your brother was involved with the attack.
my brother?
Yes, sir.
that can't be right.
bring him to me. I need to talk to him.
unfortunately, we don't know where he is at the moment.
then how can you be sure it was him?
Mr. President, after the explosion, he killed one of my men to facilitate his own escape.
there were witnesses, including your wife and daughter.
he's the insider we've been looking for.
there's no doubt.
excuse me, sir. I'm sorry for interrupting.
you asked for any updates about the assassin.
And?
he's dead. Jack just called it in.
he uplinked some video footage that you need to see.
I'll be there in a minute.
don't let me keep you from your job.
thank you, sir.
no, thank you. I owe you my life.
conference room.
uh, Mr. Hastings, uh...
Meredith Reed, the woman you brought here for questioning, where is she?
still here.
looks like she'll be cleared of any wrong doing.
I'd like to talk to her.
I'll arrange it.
thank you.
excuse me.
I saw that. - What?
the way you looked at me when he thanked me for saving his life.
you think he should have been thanking you?
I was actually thinking he should thank Jack, then Cole, then maybe me.
I underestimated you, Chloe.
you saw what was really going on; I did not.
it was a major save.
and my report will state that.
Chloe said you have some video to show me.
Yes, sir. Take a look.
these are images uplinked by Jack Bauer from the bomb site.
it's the assassin who was targeting Hassan.
we have an ID? - Not yet.
but I believe we do have a workable lead.
these are tattoos off the two men who attempted to take out our informant this afternoon.
same as the assassin.
we believe they indicate membership in a particular Russian crime syndicate.
what's a Russian gang have against the leader of the Islamic Republic?
I don't know.
could just be hired muscle.
but when the photos arrived, I ran them by the FBI.
turns out they had an agent undercover working with the Russian mob here several years ago.
a woman. - Contact her.
already done. I have a helicopter bringing her in now.
Chloe, I think you worked with her.
Renee Walker.
says here she's no longer with the FBI.
it's true.
she resigned over an internal dispute.
meaning she was fired and her records have been sealed.
what are we getting into here?
sir, we are only using her to brief us.
these Russian groups are secretive to the point of paranoia.
she's the only one who ever got close.
president Omar Hassan was not harmed in the attack, and has since been taken to a secure location.
confirmed fatalities now stand at three...
...including a police officer.
yes?
why is my brother still alive?
you're upset, Farhad.
Justifiably.
your man failed!
once you have the materials in your possession, your brother, his peace conference, none of that matters.
isn't that what you told me?
all you have to do is stay calm and stick to your plan.
or should I be looking for another buyer?
I'll be there soon.
good.
we'll have a nice meal waiting.
and we'll talk.
I've been informed that the bomb threat was a hoax.
that's confirmed, Madam President.
we've swept the negotiating chamber with sniffer dogs and ground-penetrating radar.
I can assure you. It's safe.
I'm glad to hear it.
Hassan is standing by at CTU.
how is he, Rob?
well, he narrowly escaped being blown to pieces by his own brother, so not too well.
but your call to him can't just be all sympathy and concern.
it's hardly the time.
no, it's exactly the time.
the signing is scheduled for tomorrow.
dozens of world leaders are already en route to New York.
we need to know if we still have a peace process.
put him on.
sir,
I have President Taylor for you.
madam President.
I cannot begin to say how relieved I am that you survived this terrible attack, Omar.
thank you.
I'm mortified that this outrage happened on U. S. soil.
I'm the one who should be embarrassed.
my brother, Farhad, did this.
he betrayed me, and worse, he put you in harm's way.
I should have realized what he's up to.
we can only be betrayed by the people we trust.
he fooled all of us.
sir, this is Rob Weiss.
you've heard Farhad escaped.
can I ask what you think his agenda might be, aside from targeting you?
uh, w-what I mean, sir, is... does he have a plan?
Yes, he has a plan.
regime change.
isn't that what you Americans call it?
Mr. President, we're doing everything we can to apprehend Farhad, but while he's at large, I'd understand it if you wished not to continue the talks.
however, I hope that I can persuade you to reconvene.
we have come so far together.
and to let this moment slip...
would be to hand Farhad victory.
I will not give him this satisfaction.
if you are willing to continue with these talks, so am I.
I am delighted to hear it.
uh, if you could persuade
Mr. Hastings here to release me.
we'll coordinate with CTU so that you can return to the UN as soon as possible.
I... I know that you want to be with your wife and daughter.
thank you.
thank you, Madam President.
you want your office back, Mr. Hastings.
it's fine, sir.
can I ask what you and President Taylor agreed?
that I should return to UN as soon as possible.
we'll make the arrangements.
uh, before I leave,
I would like to thank the young man who saved my life.
that would be Agent Ortiz.
he's returning to CTU right now.
you really should go to Medical.
Yeah.
soon as I hand the body over to Forensics.
what are you going to do?
finish my debrief, try and catch that last flight to Los Angeles.
Thanks, Jack. It's been an honor.
take care of yourself, okay?
Hey.
I'm glad you're okay.
Thanks. Me, too.
we ID'd the assassin using your video footage.
we think he was working for one of the Russian crime syndicates here.
any idea which one?
not yet.
but we're bringing in someone to brief us.
good.
Jack, it's Renee.
what?
Why?
six years ago, she worked undercover with the Russian mob.
FBI says she's still one of the best experts they have.
have you spoken to her?
no.
I tried phoning her a few times; she never returned my calls.
she made it clear she didn't want to speak to me, so I... I let it go.
I heard she had a rough time.
Yeah.
like, a really rough time... some sort of a breakdown.
she should be landing any minute.
look, she didn't want to talk to me then;
she's not gonna want to talk to me now, and I want to respect that.
so, please, don't tell her I'm here, okay?
you sure?
Yeah. - Okay.
I'll be waiting for you up in Debrief 1.
we'll get you a full set of photos as soon as possible.
Thanks. - Mm-hmm.
agent Ortiz.
Mr. President.
I want to thank you for saving my life.
you're welcome, sir, but it wasn't just me.
if it weren't for Jack Bauer and Chloe O'Brian, I wouldn't have been in place to make the save.
well, I'll thank them, too, but you risked your life for me.
you put yourself between me and the bomb.
my family and I are in your debt.
what's that?
it's a hazardous materials alert.
hazardous materials?
please wait here, sir.
Dr. Hendricks?
what's going on?
the body triggered a hazmat alarm.
we're reading radioactive contaminants.
what sort of contaminants?
rad count's low, so it could be uranium.
it's just trace elements.
there's no danger.
U-235?
it's highly enriched uranium.
you mean it's weapons-grade?
Yes. - How the hell did he come into contact with that?
I don't know, but he had to have been exposed to it recently.
I think I know the answer.
what is it, sir?
sir, we're talking about nuclear materials.
if you know something, you need to tell us.
I need to talk to Mr. Hastings right now.
Hey, Renee.
it's good to see you.
this way.
didn't know you were back at CTU.
Yeah. Morris lost his job a year ago.
I asked to be reinstated, and this is where they assigned me.
so what about you?
I heard you've been working for a security firm.
uh, I was.
didn't work out.
so it's confirmed and you're certain.
Thanks.
it's Forensics.
they confirmed the composition of the radioactive material.
it's U-235, 94. 7% pure, weapons-grade uranium.
if you have an explanation, sir,
I'm eager to hear it.
before we started this peace initiative, my country was close to developing a nuclear weapon.
Yes, our intelligence was aware of that.
you may also be aware that we could not enrich enough fissile material to arm it.
soon after our countries began to negotiate the peace process, my brother came up to me and said that someone had approached him with weapons-grade uranium.
who?
someone who had access to decommissioned Soviet stockpiles.
you think it's the same Russians who were trying to kill you today?
Yes, I do.
I told my brother to stay away from them, but obviously he had other plans.
Mr. President, the nuclear material that you were offered, you have any idea where it is?
that man was contaminated recently.
doesn't that mean the materials are here in the U. S?
Farhad always used to tell me that our country will always be at the mercy of the West unless we become a nuclear power.
you must find the Russians before they can get the uranium to my brother.
we'll do what we have to do, sir.
I'll notify my security forces to cooperate fully.
Patty, get me the file on Renee Walker's undercover operation.
the stars mean these men were part of the criminal elite.
Vory V Zakone.
this one spent time in a Siberian prison camp... IK-10.
the number of spires means length of sentence.
three years?
three life terms.
must have escaped.
now these, broken cross, here, here, and here.
same on all three.
so what does it mean?
Brian Hastings, director of CTU.
I appreciate that you came in.
so what does it mean?
it means you can break our arms, you can break every bone in our body, we'll never talk.
it's supposed to be the symbol for a group called "Red Square."
supposed to be? We tried to find them and never got close.
a lot of rumors that they're ex-military, special forces, intelligence, whatever.
I'm not sure they actually exist.
they exist, Ms. Walker.
and we need to find them.
Why?
you're aware of the attack in Midtown today?
you mean the smoking crater by the UN?
Yeah, it was hard to miss.
well, we believe it's just the beginning, and that the group responsible is in possession of unsecured nuclear materials.
now Dana asked you here today to brief on background.
but I have a much bigger ask.
you were undercover for nearly two years with the Russian mob.
your cover's still intact.
what are you saying exactly?
are you... are you asking me to go back in?
Dana, Chloe, would you give us a moment, please?
I wouldn't be asking if it weren't important, but yes,
I want you to go back in.
and this doesn't seem in the least bit...
I don't know, ironic to you?
I know that you left the FBI under difficult circumstances.
difficult doesn't even begin to describe it.
I can get you your badge back.
I laid down my badge, Mr. Hastings.
I took it from my pocket and I laid it down.
so why would you possibly think that I want it back?
well, what do you want?
what do I want?
nothing.
you have weapons-grade uranium in the hands of the Russian O. C.
I can do something about that.
so I'll go back in...
but not for a badge.
thank you.
we brief in ten minutes.
Hey.
just want to say good-bye.
you're off finally?
Yeah.
how did Renee's debriefing go?
it was going fine until Hastings kicked me out. - Why'd he kick you out?
it just started to get really uncomfortable.
is that her undercover file?
Yeah. I'm just trying to get up to speed.
they found traces of uranium on the assassin.
Hastings says there's nuclear materials in play.
Yeah, I heard.
what's that got to do with Renee?
he asked her to go back under with the Russians.
what is it?
Hey.
Jack.
Chloe didn't tell me you were here.
I asked her not to.
I didn't think you'd want to see me.
right.
you tried to get in touch, and I didn't call back.
sorry.
I was so happy to hear that you were okay, though.
thank you.
I'm surprised that you're back at CTU.
I'm actually not.
I'm moving back to Los Angeles with my daughter.
I'm supposed to be on a plane with her right now.
then what are you doing here?
an old informant knocked on my door.
everything went downhill from there.
the attack in Midtown.
that's why I'm here, too.
I heard Hastings wants you to go undercover with the Russians again.
he does. I've agreed.
you really think that's a good idea?
they need me.
I'm not worried about them.
I'm worried about you.
I know what you did.
really, Jack? What did I do?
you almost killed Wilson during your interrogation.
in fact it was so bad, the FBI had to let you go.
even after everything you did that day.
Renee, I know where you are, and it's a dark place.
Yeah, and I've come back.
it takes longer than you think.
I wouldn't have signed up for this if I wasn't ready.
and I don't think you are.
Renee, this is too important.
you need to let them take care of it. They will.
I appreciate what you're trying to do, really.
you said you were going to Los Angeles to be with your daughter, right?
please don't do this. - Go to California, Jack.
let me briefing.
you will receive an official apology for your detention here, but in the meantime
I hope you can accept my sincere personal regrets.
I'm sure you understand that given the threat to President Hassan, we were under extreme pressure.
I would have thought that came with the job.
along with the ability to handle it.
good-bye, Mr. Hastings.
ms. Reed.
thank God you're all right.
I was lucky.
I heard it was Farhad who tried to have you killed.
I can't believe he would betray you.
he betrayed both of us, Meredith.
and then I betrayed you.
what are you talking about?
I told them about us.
I was scared. I panicked.
I hope you can forgive me.
there's nothing to forgive.
but you stood by me.
you didn't deny me.
even though you had a million reasons to.
before that moment, I...
I never really knew what you felt for me.
you should have.
didn't I make it clear?
what? What is it?
I nearly died today.
and I saw how fragile it all is.
not only my life, but everything I've ever worked for.
any good I might be able to do.
I just can't jeopardize that.
I understand.
I'm sorry.
don't be.
Meredith...
six years ago I was undercover with these men.
they were running an arms trafficking ring.
we broke up the ring and arrested everyone except for the man in charge: Vladimir Laitanan.
he's our target.
it was through him I first heard about the group Red Square.
if anyone can connect us to them, it's him.
everything I've read about Laitanan says he disappeared without a trace.
how are you going to find him?
through this guy.
Ziya Dakhilov.
he's out on parole.
he'll take us to Vladimir.
the FBI offered Ziya full immunity if he gave up Vladimir.
he turned it down and kept his mouth shut and did his time.
I'm not FBI; I'm a former felon. Remember?
I'll be offering Ziya the deal of a lifetime.
trust me, he'll take it.
once I've made contact with Vladimir,
I'll tell him that I've heard whispers of nuclear materials on the market.
I'll say I have a buyer for them.
who's that going to be? Agent Ortiz?
you up for this?
Yes, sir.
how much money are we talking about?
for nuclear rods, we need to show offshore accounts of $100 million at least. Probably twice that.
okay, I'll get on that.
Chloe will work up a backstory to cover the time after your release from prison.
now you and Agent Ortiz need to figure out where you met, how long you've known each other.
Jack.
I thought you'd left.
I'm sorry to interrupt.
but could I have the room with Mr. Hastings alone, please?
you, too, Renee.
I think I'll stay.
so what's going on, Jack?
agent Walker hasn't been undercover for over six years.
I think you're making a mistake by putting her in.
why don't you tell him what's really on your mind, Jack?
I'll tell him exactly what I told you.
I'm concerned about her and this operation.
so what does that mean?
she's not ready for this.
you must have other options.
Mr. Hastings, no one else knows these Russians.
no one else can get you as close.
unfortunately, I'm your only choice.
I appreciate your concern, Jack, but she's right.
she's our only way in.
fine, then I want to go with her.
I assume your plan is trying to set up a competing buy?
I'll act as a buyer.
that won't be necessary. Agent Ortiz has already agreed.
he doesn't have the experience. - Then this is how he gets it.
not with nuclear weapons on the line.
Mr. Hastings,
I'm officially requesting that you send me in with Agent Walker.
Jack, if you're willing to do this, I'd be foolish to object.
we'll work up a cover for you and dovetail it with Agent Walker's alias.
we're going to have to work fast.
the Russians are going to want to unload the nuclear fuel rods as quickly as possible.
I'm sorry.
are you sure this information is reliable?
it checks out.
all right then.
Farhad is here.
bring him in.
you look worried.
every cop in the country is hunting this man, but we let him come here?
so, how does looking like a scared girl help us?
this man is our buyer.
well, we found him, we can find another.
Josef, my son, we are on the verge of the biggest deal of our lives.
Farhad is paying us more than anyone dreamed possible, and you want to send him away because he makes you nervous?
sit down, please.
a drink first, then some food.
I want to see the rods.
they will be on the same ship that will transport you back to your country as soon as we have completed our financial arrangements.
you'll be paid, Bazhaev, after I have the rods.
they are in a secure place.
show me.
you've seen the photographs.
that's not good enough.
I want proof that the rods exist or you will not be paid.
you want proof, huh?
okay.
come with me.
Josef...
my younger son.
he was transporting the rods...
...and he was careless.
there. You have your proof.
how long will it take to get the rods to the ship?
five hours.
I want to be there to supervise the loading.
whatever you want, my friend.
now where is my money?
I'll make a call.
agent Walker worked undercover as Renee Zadan for 16 months before the bust went down and she was incarcerated.
we're focusing on the period of time just after her release when she's supposed to be in Mexico working with Jack.
we're synchronizing two years of travel materials mostly to and from Mexico City.
what all do we know about this Ziya character that she's visiting?
not much.
he pled out to a Class 3 felony one month after the bust.
he's now in Long Island City working in an auto parts store as a condition to his early release.
that's where Jack and Renee are headed now.
where exactly are they?
en route. Just leaving Manhattan.
good. Chloe, download the cover materials to them.
walk them through it. Make sure there's no surprises.
Jack, it's Chloe.
you should be receiving a consolidated timeline plus detail files for travel and residency.
have they downloaded to your PDA yet?
Yes, we got it, Chloe.
Oh, and Dana would like for me to review the facts with you, if that's okay.
we're fine, Chloe. I know how to prep a cover.
I'm sure you do. It's just that... - Chloe, it's all right.
as soon as we got something, we'll get back to you.
okay, I guess
I will leave you then. Good luck.
Thanks.
you got a problem?
no, just that you've got everyone treating me like I'm an invalid.
no one's treating you like an invalid.
it's standard procedure.
they're trying to sync up two cover stories.
he's not gonna quiz me on the facts, Jack.
he gonna take one look at me and decide if I'm lying.
I know. And whatever happens after that, we need to be ready.
it's hard being with you when you don't think that I'm up to this.
I never said you weren't up to this.
I said I was concerned about you. It's different.
whatever you call it, the fact is you don't trust me, not really.
so here we are.
me and my babysitter.
how are we on aerial?
already in place and they're not even there yet.
Jack and Renee are two minutes from target.
they should arrive just before he closes up shop.
Walsh.
someday, you're going to have to tell me how you picked that name.
I can't talk now.
I like your apartment, Jenny. Real homey.
and I gotta compliment you on your housekeeping skills.
everything is in its place.
and I've been admiring your photos.
I hope you don't mind.
and I've noticed kind of a theme.
you and your boyfriend, I'm guessing.
is that right?
Yes.
I hope it's not too serious.
we're getting married, Kevin.
Wow.
who would have guessed?
when I saw you, you weren't exactly wearing an engagement ring.
so tell me about him.
Kevin, don't.
don't what?
I'm curious. Can you blame me?
he's... he's just a guy that I met.
a guy you met.
what's that mean, a guy you met?
I just spent seven years in prison with some guys.
is that the kind of guy you mean?
you know what? I'm beginning to see that we need to talk about this in person.
look, I told you that I'm in the middle of a crisis here.
I can't. I don't have time.
you know what, Jenny? In my experience, when something's important, you make time for it.
don't you think?
Jenny, are you there?
don't call me that!
what?
I said...!
you don't tell me what to call you, what not to call you, you understand that?!
I'll call you whatever I want!
you don't tell me anything, Jenny!
now get back here.
I said...
that I will as soon as I can.
Yeah, well, it better be soon.
that's him.
looks like he's closing up.
okay, we'll use these for comm so I can - hear you in case you get into trouble. - Okay.
Hey.
this is your last shot.
you do not have to do this.
I know, but I want to.
we're closed.
What'd I say?
Renee.
Ziya.
nice outfit. Not a lot of men can pull off a skirt.
when did you get out?
I thought you were serving seven-to-ten.
they let me out early. Good behavior.
good behavior.
with warden?
well, eventually, yeah.
but it's like anything else, you gotta work your way up.
so why you here?
I'm looking for Vladimir.
got a business proposition I know he'd be interested in.
what kind of business proposition?
got a buyer, something big being sold.
yeah? I don't know. Vlad disappear.
hmm, maybe.
but you can find him.
Really? Why I do that?
why do you think?
I don't know.
I'll cut you in.
unless, of course, you're making so much money here that that's of no interest to you.
see? Your greedy little eyes are saying, "Show me the money," so what's the problem, Ziya?
parole bracelet?
they know where I am 24/7.
I'm like dog.
I leave yard, I get shock.
well, then just help me out.
make some calls.
make calls?
you know what happen I make call asking where's Vladimir?
tomorrow, have accident on way for work.
no, sensitive information, done face-to-face, you know that.
you're lucky.
you get out. Me, I'm still in prison.
let me see the bracelet.
no.
come on. - No.
let me see it, Ziya. - Hmm?
Ziya... - What?
have I ever messed you up ever?
come on.
let's see.
I can get this off, guaranteed.
you screw with this, you know what happen?
cops come running in.
in two hours, I'm back inside.
parole violation. - Shh...
what? - That's not gonna happen, I'm telling you.
I know how to get this off.
how do you know? - 'Cause I'm constantly having to deal with people like you, that's how.
I can get it off if I can just hold it steady.
but... you can't cut bracelet.
I'm not gonna cut the bracelet.
what have you done?
what the hell have you done?!
like he said, he was trapped here.
and think he's gonna help you now?!
that's it. This is over.
this is over!
maybe for you, Jack, but I'm just getting started.
find something to cauterize that wound.
damn it.
I need to know about my brother.
he's alive. Get out now.
it can't be long before they realize it's you.
I need you to get back in the car.
your brother was involved with the attack.
he's the insider we've been looking for.
what's going on?
the body triggered a Hazmat alarm.
it's highly enriched uranium.- You mean it's weapons-grade?
how the hell did he come into contact with that?
I think I know the answer.
someone approached my brother with weapons-grade uranium.- Who?
someone who had access to decommissioned Soviet stockpile.
you must find the Russians before they can get the uranium to my brother.
I want proof that the rods exist, or you will not be paid.
you want proof, huh?
come with me.
my younger son, he was transporting the rods, and he was careless.
there, you have your proof.
you were undercover for nearly two years with the Russian mob.
your cover is still intact.
are you asking me to go back in?
agent Walker hasn't been undercover for over six years.
I think you're making a mistake by putting her in.
you must have other options.
she's our only way in.
fine, then I want to go with her.
I assume your plan is trying to set up a competing buy?
I'll act as a buyer.
I'm looking for Vladimir.
Vlad disappeared.
but you can find him.
they know where I am 24/7. I'm still in prison.
parole bracelet?
I can get this off.
you can't cut bracelet. - I'm not gonna cut the bracelet.
what the hell have you done?!
that's it, this is over.
maybe for you, Jack, but I'm just getting started.
I thought you were dead or captured. Where have you been?
it took me this long to get clear.
I'm with Bazhaev.
to hell with Bazhaev!
everything we have worked for, it's all over because of him.
it's not over, General.
of course it is!
your brother is still alive, and your plan to replace him as head of state is finished.
now his security forces are rounding up our people all over the city.
general Amiri was just pulled from his home five minutes ago, in front of his wife and children.
look, the Americans won't let him continue.
they'll accuse him of human rights violations and threaten to pull out of the peace talks.
once we have the uranium, my brother will become irrelevant anyway.
you are being hunted like an animal.
how do you expect to get the uranium?
Bazhaev can deliver it to us, but first I need payment wired to his account.
it's all right.
thank you.
Papa, there's a clinic in Mt. Vernon.
I found a doctor who can treat him.
we have been through this.
no doctors.
Yes, but this one has a family. I know where they are, I know their names.
I'll make sure he keeps his mouth shut.
and you can guarantee no one else in this clinic will find out?
another doctor, a nurse, no one?
the authorities know about the nuclear material or they will soon enough, and they'll be looking everywhere.
putting Oleg in a clinic would lead them right to us.
he's going to die if we don't get him help.
then he's going to die.
but alone like this?
in a cold room behind the kitchen?
he's my brother, Papa, and he's your son.
all right.
take him to the country house. Ulana will look after him.
thank you, Papa.
what is it?
Farhad is asking for you.
you have news for me?
Yes. The money will be transferred to your account shortly.
when can I take possession of the rods?
as soon as we have the money.
five hours.
good. I'll help you pass the time.
you have a preference?
no.
then take both.
he's still bleeding out.
this should cauterize the wound.
okay, it's working.
who are you calling?
Hastings. - Why?
because I'm shutting this operation down.
you shouldn't be in the field, and this proves it.
this was the only play, Jack. You would've done the same thing.
the play was to get him to cooperate.
he will cooperate. - How do you figure?
look, I know these guys, Jack.
the only thing that Ziya likes more than 13-year-old girls is money.
he'd have butchered himself for a score like this.
Yeah, well, Hastings still needs to know the truth.
the truth?
that you're unstable!
look... I don't blame you after everything you've been through, but you are not fit for this mission.
I went through a rough patch, yeah, but I came out on the other side.
and I don't think you have.
the bottom line is, I'm still the best chance that anyone has of intercepting that uranium, and I can do it now.
so, what's it going to be, you making that phone call or what?
he's waking up, Jack. Better make up your mind.
fine.
you see what you can get out of him.
but don't forget, I'm listening.
shut up, Ziya.
you'll get your painkillers as soon as we get out of here.
what did you do?!
I got the bracelet off, all right, I did you a favor.
you crazy bitch! You cut off my thumb!
look, what's done is done.
you can either stay here and whine about it like a baby or you can come with me and be a rich man.
look, I'm willing to give you a point on this deal off the top.
it's a lot of money, Ziya.
how much?- Two-and-a-half million.
maybe three when it's all done.
two million?
you're serious?
you tell me.
I take this deal to Vladimir, and it's not real, you know what happens?!
why would I be here if this wasn't real?!
fine, forget it, Ziya. I'll find Vladimir my own way.
no, wait!
I don't know where he is exactly, but where he might be.
tell me.
no, I'll take you there myself.
you have a car? - I have truck; it's parked out back.
all right, I'll drive.
come on!
yeah? - Jack, I just found out in my background check that Ziya has a probation officer. How do you want to handle this?
you don't need to.
he has a tracking bracelet.
not anymore. - I don't understand.
those things have anti-tamper mechanisms.
you can't cut them off him without triggering an alarm.
Yeah, well, trust me, it's been taken care of.
Jack, what happened in there?
Renee got the result she wanted.
Ziya's taking her to Vladimir.
Dana's still working on your cover profile.
okay, they're moving. - I'll call you when it's ready.
Jack's still waiting on the rest of that profile.
I'm still working the timeline. Tell him I'm almost finished.
okay.
aren't you going to get that?
Yeah, probably should.
Hello?
I'm in the middle of something. Hold on a second.
Chloe, I will send that profile to you as soon as I'm done.
okay.
I told you not to call.
Yeah, I know what you told me.
but now that I'm here in your apartment, I just can't help but miss you.
my shift is over in the morning. I will see you then.
Yeah, well, that's just not going to work now, is it?
I'm right in the middle of something, Kevin.
turn on the news if you don't believe me.
Hey, that's not my problem.
okay, I need to see you. You have 15 minutes.
that's not possible.
okay, you got 30.
who said I can't be reasonable?
don't make me call that little boyfriend of yours.
rock his perfect little world.
Hey, pal, congratulations on the engagement.
by the way, her name's not Dana Walsh, it's Jenny Scott.
Oh, did I mention that she's an ex-con?
no, no, no, nothing too serious.
just accessory to murder is all.
you still there?
Yeah, I'm here.
see you soon.
Arlo, can I ask you something?
Yes, I'm available Saturday night, and I can change my plans for Friday if you want.
also, I'm free on Thursday.
look, Arlo, I'm sorry.
it's just, a situation's come up, and I have to go home for a while.
Dana, we're in the middle of a major protocol.
I understand that, and I won't be long, I promise.
but I need you to cover for me.
put the finishing touches on the profile for Renee Walker and Jack Bauer.
and if I ask what this is about, you'll tell me... - That it's none of your business.
right. I thought so.
send it to Chloe's screen as soon as you're finished.
okay. Thank you, Arlo. I owe you one.
one what?
thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.
I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.
I've spoken to 12 heads of state.
they're concerned, but they're all still planning to attend the signing ceremony tomorrow.
well, I've got some bad news.
apparently, killing President Hassan was only part of his brother's plan.
CTU now believes he's also trying to acquire weapons-grade uranium.
from whom?
a Russian crime syndicate here in New York.
half of them are ex-Soviet Army or KGB.
if anyone had access to unsecured stockpiles...
it's what we've been afraid of since the Wall came down.
is President Hassan aware of this?
he's the one who told CTU about it.
director Hastings has already initiated an undercover operation to try to recover the uranium before it's smuggled out of the country.
the nuclear materials are here on U. S.soil? Are they sure?
afraid so.
Ethan, you asked if President Hassan was aware of this. Why?
helps explain what's been going on in the Islamic Republic.
I just spoke with our ambassador in the I. R.K.
Hassan's security forces are sweeping through the capital, arresting opposition leaders, shuttering news organizations.
has he declared martial law?
not officially, but effectively, that's exactly what he's been doing.
who can blame him?
I mean, his brother can't have been acting alone.
we want Hassan cracking down on hardliners in his own government.
except that he's defying his country's laws, as well as his international human rights obligations.
and if he continues, it may delegitimize the peace accord.
is President Hassan back yet from CTU?
he'll be here in ten minutes.
I want to speak to him... alone.
I'll take care of it.
that's enough.
what's your problem?
I need you thinking clearly.
you tell me you'd get me real painkiller.
put it away.
I'm surprised.
I'm surprised you take deal to him again after what he did to you.
how much further?
okay. You don't want to talk about Vladimir.
I understand. I don't blame you.
after all, what is there to say about such a man?
nothing good, nothing very... - Just tell me how much further.
ten minute.
touchy, touchy.
yeah?
Arlo just locked your cover profile. I'm uplinking it to you now.
okay, hold on one sec.
okay, I got it.
Hey, you're taking me out of Renee's comm when you call, right? - Yes.
okay, I want you to go into her undercover file with regards to Vladimir Laitanan.
I need to know everything that happened between them.
I'll call you right back. - Okay, thanks.
Mr. President. - Your chief of staff said it was urgent.
it is, but first, I want to say again how thankful we are that you're all right.
if this is about my security forces and the necessary steps I'm taking back home, I'm afraid I can't help you.
are you so sure they're necessary?
what happened today was nothing short of a coup.
these same people are trying to restart my country's nuclear weapons' program.
I understand, but... - No, I don't think you do.
yours is an open society, Madam President, governed by the rule of law.
mine is closed.
the only real law is power.
any perceived weakness on my part, and I'm finished.
I'm aware of the complexities of your situation, Mr. President.
my brother tried to kill me, helped by elements within my own government.
those elements must now be purged.
Purged?
you mean, executed?
it is the only thing my people understand.
I can't vouch for you as a reformer, Mr. President, if you renege on your human rights obligations.
the world is trusting you because I trust you.
you're asking me to show mercy to enemies who are trying to destroy me.
I am asking you to find a middle way, in the name of bringing peace to a region that hasn't known peace for generations.
I need to see my family now.
I found a doctor.
a doctor?
someone who can help you, someone we can control, but Papa says it's too risky.
Papa's right.
condemning you to death?
I don't believe that.
what happened... was my own fault.
the family shouldn't have to pay for my mistake.
you know, all these years, I thought it was an act.
but you really are a good son, aren't you?
I'm no better or worse than you, Josef.
you're my older brother.
you've always looked out for me.
what are you doing? Joseph? Joseph, what are you doing?!
I'm taking you to the doctor.
but Papa said we can't. - I don't care what Papa said!
I'm not letting you die without a fight.
you are old enough to make your own decisions.
I've decided to stay.
as you wish. - You should stay, too.
I can't. - Why not?
you think that your father is one way, but he's not what you think.
stop doing that. You always do that. - What?
imply things, but you never actually tell me what you mean.
it is better that way, Kayla, believe me.
I don't want to poison you against your father.
there. You're doing it again.
you can't help yourself. - Doing what again?
father!
Oh, are you all right? - I'm fine.
we thought that... - I know, I know.
Kayla, I need to speak to your mother now alone.
okay.
Dalia? - We have nothing to say to each other.
Dalia, please.
do you love her?
it's over. I ended it.
you didn't answer the question.
be honest for once. Show me a little respect. I'm your wife, damn it.
do you love her?
maybe I thought I did.
then say it.
what does it matter now? - It matters to me.
the truth is... ...I'm just glad I could still feel something, anything.
and that's my fault somehow? How dare you!
our fault.
there's enough blame to go around.
Dalia, please don't go. - What?
I don't want you to leave.
don't worry.
my brother is a traitor.
my highest officers are conspiring against me.
and now President Taylor is threatening to pull out of the peace talks.
it has been a long time since you've asked my advice about anything.
you were the one who always gave me the best counsel.
thank you for remembering that.
then you'll stay?
it's too late for that, Omar.
too much has happened between us.
Dalia... - I'm sorry.
Vlad operates out of here?
sometimes.
he moved around a lot.
that's why cops don't find him inside here.
come on, let's go.
Hey, Ziya? Hmm?
you know, Vladimir was never fond of surprises, so I was thinking... maybe you could go in first?
get him used to the idea of me again.
whet his appetite?
exactly.
okay.
is our cover in place?
Yeah. Chloe got me everything.
good. Let's start going over what happened in Mexico City.
how we met, who we dealt with.
first tell me about Vladimir.
what do you want to know?
what he did to you? I heard what Ziya said.
come on, Jack, he's a drama queen.
damn it, Renee, I am running this! Stop messing with me!
I'm responsible for your safety.
so, when I ask you a straight question, you give me a straight answer.
look, it was nothing, all right?
I handled him six years ago, I can handle him today.
the only thing that I am worried about is locking down this cover, so, please, let's not waste another minute on Vladimir.
I'm a Munich-based arms dealer named Ernst Meier.
we met in Mexico City.
you became my liaison to the locals.
long time.
it's me, Ziya.
I know who you are.
now what the hell are you doing here?
I've got business.
business? - Yeah.
with Vladimir.
you've got business with me?
I should kill you for even thinking of coming here.
what?
let me go, please! No, I...
five years I've been living underground.
five years! And now you walk into my place of business?
you're on probation! - No. Not anymore, Vlad.
look.
she got bracelet off.
what are you talking about? Who did?
it's what I'm trying to tell you.
she came to my place looking for you.
Yeah, she said she had a buyer that you'd want to hear about.
that it'd be good for all of us. It'd be worth it for all of us.
Renee. - Dah.
did she say where she'd been these last five years?
uh, where everybody else was.
in jail.
then she went to Mexico City. She ssid she got the opportunity there.
mexico City, huh? - Dah.
what do you think, Lugo?
you believe this piece of dirt?
sure I believe him.
he's too stupid to make up a story like that.
it's her I don't believe. I never did.
I told you, Lugo, it wasn't her.
she's not the one who sold us out.
she shows up out of the blue, then 16 months later, the feds are down our throats.
I'm just saying, Vlad.
you were just saying.
Where's Renee now?
outside.
clean yourself up.
bring her to me.
Arlo, where's Dana? She isn't at her desk.
she went home. - Home?
Yeah.
who is it?
it's me. You have my key.
nice of you to drop by.
it's not funny.
what the hell?! Who's he?
that's Nick. It's a buddy of mine from Beaumont.
get him the hell out of here.
you know I can't do that, Jen.
I already told him he could stay.
it'd be impolite.
here.
what's this?
it's $500.
it's all I could get out of the cash machine.
I'll get you another 500 in the morning.
you think you're smart, and the whole world's stupid.
that's just not how it is, Jen.
I don't think you're stupid.
no? But you think you can buy me off with $1, 000?
I'm not trying to buy you off.
no, no.
what do you want from me?
you know what I want?
what I really want is for you to stop treating me like some dumbass, 19-year-old stickup artist with a fast car!
you're not the only one who's grown up.
easy, Kevin, easy.
I've been waiting for this moment.
dreaming about it.
you owe me.
if you think that I testified against you, I didn't.
don't lie to me!
I'm not lying to you!
I got out of jail before you did, yeah, but only because I went in as a minor.
no other reason.
the truth is, it doesn't change things, one way or another.
see, I've done my homework.
I know what your job is.
I'm a data analyst, nothing more.
Yeah, but you're a data analyst for CTU.
you got access to all sorts of good stuff-- bank codes, port authority manifests, stock exchange.
access, yeah, but not unrestricted access.
you'll figure something out.
you always do.
but whatever it is, the payout's got to be at least six figures, okay?
please, Kevin.
okay, here's the deal.
you do this one thing for me, and I'm gone.
I'll never bother you again.
I can't.
you can.
and you will.
since last August, we've been living and operating out of a hotel called Bella Noche on Avenida Juarez.
can't they check that?
Yeah, it's been set up as a safe haven for high-end criminal activity.
they don't keep records. Have you got the name?
Bella Noche. I got it.
okay, I'm going to be monitoring you, filling in the details.
just listen to my voice. I'll get you all the information you need.
he's coming.
come on. Let's go.
yeah?
it's not pretty, Jack. She had a real problem on her hands.
talk to me.
according to the responsible agent, Vladimir Laitanan was completely obsessed with her.
it turned violent.
how violent?
broken ribs, a busted cheekbone.
a couple of trips to the emergency room.
did he rape her?
not according to these files, but it looks like he tried a couple of times.
did she say anything about this to you or Hastings?
no.
what's this about, Jack?
the FBI tried to cover this up as much as they could.
but after she left the bureau, Renee went into a tailspin.
she tried to kill herself at least once that I know about.
she says she's past it, but I know she's not. I can see it in her eyes.
you think she's purposely putting herself in harm's way?
I don't think she cares what happens to her either way.
where is she now?
she's going in. I'm going to put you on speaker.
hands up.
turn around.
go.
Hello, Vlad.
you changed your face.
I had it done in Caracas.
what do you think?
makes you look younger.
I should get the name of that doctor.
he's not practicing anymore.
a sad story.
our little friend here says you were in Mexico City.
for what?
had some business.
good for you. I have some contacts there myself.
Yeah, I know you do.
so... give me names.
the Peralta-Rodriguez... family.
uh... The Peralta-Rodriguez family.
Castorenas in Guadalajara.
I know Ramon. Is his brother Luiz still running their heroin operations?
he was killed nine months ago by the Federales.
not since he was killed by the Federales nine months ago.
you know, Renee, now that you mention it, there is something different about you, too.
how do you mean?
your eyes. Your skin.
you look like hell.
well, it's hard to look your best with a gun in your face.
no, that's not it.
something else.
have you been sick?
no.
maybe you picked up a little Hepatitis C on your travels?
where were you staying in Mexico City?
the Bella.
Bella Noche Hotel.
Bella Noche, naturally.
then, of course, you must know the government official who allows it to operate without police interference.
Chloe, the hotel in Mexico City-- was there a local politician on the take?
I don't have it here. - Neither do I.
checking DEA database. - Come on.
give me a minute. - She doesn't have a minute.
waiting for a name!
go ahead, tell him.
really getting tired of this, Vlad.
his name!
got it-- Raul Castillo.
Raul Castillo, all right?
are we done playing 20 questions now?
Yes, I believe we are.
you know, Renee, I had almost forgotten how much fun you are.
you're not like other women.
you have balls.
hmm, you always did say the nicest things.
can we talk about this deal now?
I wish it were that simple.
tie her up.
what?
Vlad, what are you doing?
you gave me all the right answers, Renee, but you're not telling the truth.
you're making a mistake.
this is the chance of a lifetime.
him, too.
Vlad, wait.
put them in the trunk.
Vladimir, Vladimir, no!
no, Vladimir, please don't do this!
listen to me! She come to me!
she come to my place, the bitch!
I swear!
Vladimir, I don't know anything about this!
No!
Chloe, what the hell just happened?
they put her in the trunk, I lost audio.
boosting the signal now.
Renee? - Try it again.
Renee, can you hear me?
say something.
Chloe, I don't have her.
then the car must be armored. Either that or her comm shorted out.
are you seeing this?
I am.
okay, I'm following north through an alley towards Woodward.
I think this operation just blew up.
Jack, are you planning to intercept?
not if the car is armored. I'm gonna need tactical support.
I'm alerting Hastings to scramble a team now.
tell him I see four men in the car, and we're going to have to assume they're taking Renee somewhere to kill her.
copy that.
damn it!
don't work too late, hon. Call me when you're on the road.
will do.
Dr. Levine.
how did you get in here?
my brother is sick.
I'm not seeing patients right now.
he needs your help.
I'm gonna call you an ambulance.
no. No one else can know about this.
my men are outside your house in New Rochelle.
I don't believe you. I just spoke to my wife.
we're outside the gate.
the address is 1614 Brook Street.
the light in your little daughter's room just went out about ten minutes ago, so I want you to put the phone down because you're not going to try to warn anybody about this.
do you understand?
I understand.
my brother has radiation poisoning.
he needs treatment.
his symptoms seem quite advanced.
I'm not sure what it is I can do for him.
well, you'd better be able to do something, for your family's sake.
I, um... I need to know what kind of materials he came in contact with.
it was uranium.
do you know what variant, the isotope?
weapons-grade 235.
Jack, this is Hastings. TAC teams are three minutes away.
all of them aware that Renee is in the trunk?
the instructions are to engage only on my command.
any indication where they're taking her? - None.
any percentage in letting this play out? - no
as soon as she's out of the vehicle, she becomes that much more vulnerable.
if we engage now, it means ending the operation.
this operation's over. Vladimir didn't take the bait.
target just turned south on Flushing.
Jack, that's a feeder onto the BQE in 2. 6 miles.
Mr. Hastings, if we don't engage on these surface streets, we lose our tactical advantage.
Chloe, get me an ETA.
intercept in... two minutes, ten seconds.
sir, you need to make the call now.
all right, I'm authorizing engagement.
stand by for intercept protocols.
this is good. Pull over.
open it.
Vladimir. - Take them out of the trunk.
lugo, please, you tell him, tell Vladimir... - Chloe, I've got a signal again.
please, Vladimir, Vlad...- Something's wrong
they definitely sound stopped, but the vehicle I'm following is still going south on Flushing.
she told me to come to you!
shut up, shut up, Ziya.
it's not going to do any good.
confirming that, Jack, the target is still moving.
Chloe, we're following a decoy.
they must have left in another vehicle.
find it!
okay, pulling up a satellite footage.
all right, TAC teams, hold your positions, stand by.
Jack, another car drove out of the back of the auto parts building five minutes after the first one.
are you kidding me?!
I'm sorry, we were focusing everything on your follow.
just tell me where they are!
take them down to the water.
okay, I've got a GPS lock on Renee.
No! No!
No!
vladimir attacked you, and you defended yourself-- that's what happened.
I don't know. - I do.
if anybody else wants to ask you questions about that,
I'll be right there with you to answer them.
you were implying something about Dana, and I want to know what it is.
I think she went to meet some guy.
take a look at this.
you think you can find her?
you promise me I do this one thing for you, and then you'll leave me alone.
that's not gonna happen.
this is a sweet operation that we got going here. You know?
you getting the access codes, and us pulling the jobs.
you can't do this to me, Kevin.
you know who I am?
all I know is that there's a very powerful man in the Russian Syndicate who's been trafficking weapons-grade uranium.
who do you work for?
I'm not at liberty to say.
Dmitri, work on him, until he's ready to tell us everything.
it's over, you know that, right?
you want to know where the rods are?
I will tell you.
but I want full immunity.
Amanda, are you seeing this?
where the hell are the rods?
we've picked up trace radiation signatures.
the rods were here.
I told you, they were there.
I had two of my men guarding them.
we found their bodies; both shot.
Josef.
I wasn't sure I believed Josef that you would betray your father.
you were upset that he was holding up delivery of the rods.
now I've gotten them for you.
when will you get here?
less than five minutes.
just have my money ready.
the following takes place between 12: 00 A. M.and 1: 00A. M.
CTU. O'Brian. - Chloe, it's Jack.
do you have Hastings there? - Yes.
are you ready to trace the call? - We're ready.
as soon as Bazhaev gets his son on the phone, we can begin to triangulate.
okay, hold on.
Farhad, where are you? You're late.
Josef, it's me, your father.
don't hang up. Stay on the line. Please.
I know you have the rods.
Yes.
I wanted you to know.
the police know, too.
they're here.
you told the police? - Of course not.
it was Vladimir's buyer-- he's a Federal agent.
Josef, just so we're up front, I'm here with your father.
my name is Jack Bauer; I work with CTU.
well, do what you want with him; I don't care.
maybe you don't-- but your father cares about you.
he negotiated immunity for you.
all you need to do is bring the fuel rods in, and you can put the rest of this behind you.
it's the only way you'll be safe.
safe?
did my father tell you about my other brother?
what he did to him?
oleg was dying; you know that.
Yeah, we could have saved him.
he would be alive if not for your precious deal.
you are right, maybe you are right, I don't know, but...
that doesn't bring Oleg back, and I cannot bear to lose another son.
don't worry about me.
I'll be fine. - No, you won't be.
you won't be anything.
it's over.
federal agents are here going through everything.
the entire city is under guard.
if you don't bring the rods in, they will hunt you down.
they will kill you, Josef.
I won't be able to protect you.
I don't want to see you hurt.
if I hand over the rods, how does this work?
tell us where you are, and we'll bring you in.
Oh, just like that?
after everything we've done?
Yes, I told you-- they have given us immunity.
please, Josef, please.
this is your last chance.
are you there?
Yes, I'm here.
you need to bring him in now, before Farhad gets there.
Josef, did you hear that?
you need to move.
all right, I'm on my way.
I'll call you from the road to let you know where to meet me.
careful with the rods.
sounded like shots fired.
you need to help him!
where is he?! - I don't know.
Chloe, did you get a trace on that call?
not exactly, but it looks like he was in central Queens near Flushing Meadow Park.
I want units combing that area.
Jack, bring your suspect back to CTU.
copy that.
get him ready for transport now.
is he dead? - Yes.
we need to hurry.
the boat is waiting for us at the port.
the port may not be the right thing.
what do you mean?
the authorities know our plan.
we need a new one.
Hey. What are you doing? Don't touch that.
did you get that? - Yes, Jack.
we're trying to get an I. D.off the voice print.
so far, no luck locking down a location.
copy that. We're on our way back now.
we need to hurry.
take the van and get the rods...
we've got a match for the voice at the end of the call-- Farhad Hassan.
so, he got his fuel rods.
any I. D.on the other man we heard?
no, sir. Mr. Hastings, Rob Weiss for you.
tell him I'll be right with him.
give me an ETA on Bazhaev. - Yes, sir.
start the interrogation as soon as he gets here.
yeah? - Jack, it's Chloe.
Hastings wants your ETA.
he's anxious to interrogate Bazhaev.
I'm about 15 minutes out.
but I wouldn't count on getting anything from him.
if Bazhaev could have told me how to get to the people that just killed his son, he would have.
Jack, I heard about what you went through.
are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks.
how's Renee?
pretty worried about you.
they've still got her in medical. - Yeah.
could you patch me through to her?
hold on. - Okay.
Hey. - Rene, I have Jack.
Jack. - How are you?
uh, fine, I'm fine. What about you?
we had a line on the fuel rods.
we lost it.
so what's the plan now?
it's Hastings' call.
I'm bringing the prisoner back to CTU, then I'm out.
they ask you about what happened, about Vladimir?
uh, yes, Chloe did.
Chloe did the debrief?
Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't...
I wouldn't really call it a debrief.
we talked, uh, mostly, and, uh, then I wrote a statement.
and you explained how you acted in self-defense?
Yes, like we agreed.
that's how it happened.
Renee, you've got to stick with that.
Yeah, yes, I'm gonna try.
I know this is hard for you, but you did nothing wrong, and you need to start believing that.
okay?
okay.
Jack, I don't...I don't know how to say this, so I'm just gonna say it,'cause I need to make sure that I'm not misunderstanding, but.
when you say that I "have you..."
I meant it like it sounded.
so now what do we do?
we'll figure it out.
okay.
I'll be in in about 15 minutes. Bye.
rob, it's Brian.
I just got a flash from your office how this immunity situation the president authorized played out.
it's not good, Brian.
really not.
now, as I understand it, Bazhaev's son swiped the rods from his father before we got there.
that's correct.
and now the son is dead. - Yes.
do we know who has the rods now?
apparently, it's Farhad Hassan.
and where is he?
we're looking.
meaning you have no idea.
Brian, I pushed the president to resurrect CTU with you at the helm.
now, you tell me you can do the job, I believe you.
I can do the job. - Good to hear it.
cause when things get this colossally screwed up, people look for someone to blame.
so what are you saying?
I'm saying I don't want that person to be you.
I put you there; you're my guy.
if you fail, I fail.
and that cannot happen.
are we on the same page here?
so what have you got in mind?
she killed one of our main leads, isn't that correct?
he was a psychopath-- she was defending herself.
she stabbed him 15 times.
what, are you saying it was murder?
I'm saying that's for lawyers to decide.
we're talking about a woman who put her life on the line when she didn't have to.
I'm sure that will weigh in her favor.
you know what a conviction would mean-- she'd go away for years.
well, someone has to pay for this, Brian.
so you tell me-- who do you want that to be?
I'm sending someone over from Justice.
a Kristin Smith.
she'll take care of everything.
what do you need from me?
just open the door and get out of the way.
we did a sweep, sir.
no trace of any hazardous materials.
fine. Finish up, get back to base.
Yes, sir.
arlo? - Yeah.
find Dana yet? - I think so.
I'm tracking the GPS coordinates off her phone.
all right, send them to my PDA.
are you sure that's a good idea?
I mean, there could be a reasonable explanation...
Hey, you're the one who stuck his nose in all this.
just do it.
okay.
coordinates are on your phone.
Thanks.
look, I'm sending everyone back to CTU.
what are you going to do?
I'll be there within the hour.
if Hastings asks, just tell him I'm following up a lead.
look, I know Dana means a lot to you, but do you really think this is worth going AWOL over?
she's my fiancee, Arlo.
Jim, I'm taking your vehicle.
find Owen, have him take SWAT back to CTU.
say I'll be right behind them.
no problem, sir.
is Dana back yet?
I don't think so, sir.
do you need her for something?
do I need her for something?
Yes, Arlo, she's my chief data analyst.
I need her to do her job.
you track her down, and you let me know when you find her.
Mr. Hastings, Kristin Smith from the Justice Department is here to see you.
thank you.
ms. Smith. - Mr. Hastings.
did Rob Weiss brief you? - He did.
I have to interview a Renee Walker.
I read her statement on the way over.
did it appear to you that she's guilty of murder?
Mr. Weiss warned me you might have issues with this.
with hanging a brave woman out to dry? Yes, I do.
there are major discrepancies between her statement and the forensic evidence.
all I'm asking her to do is to set the record straight.
I feel it would be prudent to restrict surveillance access to this interview.
fine.
but I would also like a video record of it in the event of legal proceedings.
can I ask you to provide that?
Yes. Right this way, please.
this is a transcript of your statement.
you should review it before you sign it.
how far out did Jack say he was?
15 minutes.
this is Kristin Smith from Justice.
she needs to talk to Renee, so if you'll excuse us, Chloe.
talk to her about what?
now, Chloe.
thank you, Mr. Hastings.
what is she talking to her about?
she was about to sign her statement.
I already debriefed her.
Kristin just needs to fill in a few details.
I already filled in the details.
I know that you are protective of Renee.
I respect that.
than let me sit in on the interview.
Why?
was your debrief not a full and honest statement of the facts?
we have nuclear materials in the hands of terrorists.
now, I need you back at your desk focused on that.
Yes, sir.
what is this place?
a staging area.
it belongs to a businessman who supports our cause.
I don't want to delay too long.
we need to find another way to get the nuclear rods out of the country.
you heard what the American said to Bazhaev's son.
they already know what we're trying to do.
which is why we need to move quickly.
the Americans are not stupid, Farhad.
if we go near any airfield or harbor now, the radiological detectors will spot us.
who are these men, Samir?
these are men I have recruited.
our men.
what are they doing here?
they're going to unload the rods.
we need to get rid of the van.
and then what?
you should rest.
I don't need to rest.
I need to know what we're doing.
we can't get the rods out of the country.
so let's use them.
use them?
how? - As a weapon.
a radiological bomb.
we'll show the Americans how strong we are.
show them how strong we are?
are you out of your mind?
if we use the rods against the Americans, they will destroy our country.
they'll bomb us, invade.
and if we do nothing, they'll invade us anyway.
that's what this peace treaty with your brother is all about.
they're trying to turn us into another corrupt,Mid-East regime with your brother as dictator, kept in power by American guns and money.
isn't that what we came together to prevent?
is there no other way?
america will always be our enemy.
remember, my friend even a giant can be toppled by a single stone.
we need to make them fear us.
then I'm with you.
so you said in your statement that you killed Vladimir Laitanan in self-defense.
is that correct?
Yes, that's why it's in my statement.
what I didn't see in the statement was any mention of your history with Laitanan.
you did have a history with him.
I worked an undercover operation with the FBI six years ago.
vladimir Laitanan was the target.
and during the course of that operation, you had to get close to him.
he became obsessed with you.
he tried to rape you.
Yes.
but you were able to stop him.
I fought him.
put me in the hospital with two broken ribs.
I'm sure that's in thereto
you were able to fight off a stronger, violent man.
it's impressive.
but this time when he attacked you, you didn't fight him off.
I couldn't.
he had his hands around my neck trying to strangle me.
I understand.
you thought he was going to kill you.
you were in fear for your life.
so what happened next?
he was choking me.
I grabbed the knife and I stabbed him.
in self-defense?
Yes.
you stabbed him in self-defense...
15 times.
15 times.
the first blow alone could have stopped him, but you didn't stop.
look at me, Renee.
you were an investigator for the FBI.
by all accounts, one of the best they had.
put yourself on my side of the table.
look at what I'm looking at.
there's a dead body.
on the one hand, I have your statement saying you acted in self-defense.
on the other, I have these.
evidence of a sustained and furious assault with clear intent to kill.
now as an investigator, you know which version is true, don't you?
I acted in self-defense.
let me tell you what I think happened.
you used an operation of unparalleled importance to seek revenge against a target without any regard for the final outcome.
I'm telling you, he attacked me first.
ms. Walker, I'm well aware of your sacrifice in service to this country, but I do not think that it is fair or right that CTU should be taken down because you used this operation to seek out your own personal vendetta against Vladimir Laitanan.
I looked at your file.
this isn't the first time you lost control.
you almost killed Alan Wilson.
that's why you got fired by the FBI, isn't it?
Yes.
I can see what this is doing to you, Renee.
it is tearing you up inside.
let it out. Tell me the truth.
you killed Vladimir Laitanan because the thought of him touching you again was intolerable.
do the right thing here.
that's what happened, isn't it, Renee?
is that right, Renee?
put him into holding. No phone calls. No communication.
I would like to see my son's body.
we haven't found him yet.
what's wrong?
I've been trying to reach you. It's about Renee. She's being questioned again.
I thought you said you already completed the debrief.
I did. Hastings ordered it.
he called in some woman from the Justice Department.
Where's Renee now?
she's in medical.
can you get eyes in that room?
no. He cut off all access.
what is going on?
they're setting her up to take the fall for the failure of this mission.
sorry, sir. No one's...
they're setting you up. Don't say another word.
it's too late. - What do you think you're doing?
get out of here now.
how dare you?
after everything she sacrificed.
after everything she's lost.
have you no decency? - Jack.
this is over.
hands in the air.
do it now!
son, you better put that down or you're going to get hurt.
it's all right. Go.
ma'am, hands in the air.
do you have what you need to turn the rods into a bomb?
we're gathering materials.
must be difficult at such short notice.
explosives, no.
detonator?
we're working on it.
I might know somebody.
a professor in the city.
with expertise in electronics.
you sure he can be trusted? - Yes.
he will help. He will do whatever I ask.
but still...
I will bring this up very carefully.
I need to talk to him in private.
very well.
there's a phone in the office. Ali will take you.
what is the target? Is that decided?
so many targets in New York.
it will be hard to choose.
Samir! Over here!
it was Farhad. He escaped.
find him!
now!
cuffs off.
give us the room.
sit down, Jack.
I'll stand.
so, this is the new CTU-- you hang your own.
if you mean Renee Walker, we're just asking some questions. Standard procedure.
standard procedure is a debrief, which Chloe completed.
but instead, you've got some hack from Justice in there trying to initiate a criminal prosecution.
we're just trying to establish the facts.
you're trying to save your ass.
I was there when you asked her for her help.
and she gave it to you, and we acquired the target.
and this is how you pay her back.
I'm not going to let you do this.
I'll call the White House first.
the White House knows. Rob Weiss sent that woman over here.
sorry. Maybe I wasn't clear. I meant I'd call the president.
well, good luck with that, Jack, because I think the president takes murder pretty seriously.
my recollection? She prosecuted her own daughter.
now, I'm not asking.
sit down.
sorry to interrupt. - We're busy, Chloe.
I don't mean to intrude, but I've got Farhad Hassan on the line.
I didn't believe it, either, but the voice prints match.
can you tell where he is?
no. He's on a secure line.
can I just put him through?
Mr. Hassan. This is Brian Hastings, director of CTU.
there are people chasing me.
they have the rods you're looking for.
I thought you had the rods.
no. No more.
they turned against me.
they have their own plan-- an attack on New York.
an attack on New York? When, exactly?
soon. Very soon.
who are these people?
they are IRK operatives working in this country.
okay, I need names.
just get me out of here.
I'll tell you everything I know.
we'll get you out, Mr. Hassan. I give you my word.
now, where are you?
forest Hills.
uh, some kind of boat warehouse.
hurry. I'm injured.
they're hunting me.
hold on and keep this line open.
what do you want me to do?
pinpoint his location and get me Cole.
I can't. - What do you mean, you can't?
his team came back. He didn't.
Owen said he was following a lead.
all right, fine. Get me Owen. Tell him he's going to be leading the team.
Owen? Are you sure? - Just do it, Chloe.
they're going to take you down and process you.
I want you out of this building.
fine.
Hey, hey, come on.
what's the hurry?
what's the hurry? Your friend's a total freak show.
I know, but come on.
don't go.
I'll make it up to you. Okay?
come on. At least let me give you a ride back into town.
we'll walk.
night, ladies!
gonna take a leak. - All right.
Cole, what are you doing here?
you're asking me that? We're in the middle of an operation, Dana.
you can't just abandon your post.
I can explain.
you can explain later.
right now, I'm taking you back to CTU.
we can deal with our personal problems after we've secured the nuclear materials.
it's not what you think. - Yeah? What do I think?
I am not sleeping with him.
save it. I saw the pictures.
what pictures?
just get in.
I am not leaving! - Why the hell not?
because if I leave, this will never end.
what will never end?
you do not understand.
then make me understand, damn it!
I don't think that I can.
try.
okay.
we don't have a lot of time.
so you better start talking.
my name is not Dana Walsh.
it's Jenny Scott.
yes?
you find Farhad?
still looking.
I injured him badly.
he won't get far.
we don't know who he might have contacted.
I'll be traveling with the rods to a secure location.
do you want me to come in?
no. You stay here, and you find him.
it's a six-acre warehouse complex in Forest Hills.
Farhad is somewhere in one of these buildings.
the rods must be there, too.
drones are airborne, but they won't have eyes for another 12 minutes.
what about the police?
they're redirecting their resources, but it's a big area
it's gonna take a while to cordon off.
director Hastings. You wanted to see me, sir?
in the absence of Agent Ortiz, I assume you're ready to take charge of the operation.
Yes, sir. Three units standing by.
all right. I'll walk you out.
there's a lot of pressure on you, Agent Owen.
Oh, I can handle it, sir.
all right, talk me through it. What's the attack grid?
our working theory's that the nuclear materials are still in the proximity of Farhad.
teams Alpha and Bravo are tasked with locating and securing the rods.
what about Team Charlie?
they're responsible for the actual evac, sir.
it's a standard urban search-and-rescue-- we're in, we're out.
nothing standard about it.
wait here.
you've got something to say, say it.
think about it.
the people that are chasing Farhad already know they've got a big security problem, so most likely by the time your men get there, those fuel rods will be long gone.
and you're down to one team covering Farhad?
what if they run into resistance?
what if they do?
well, at that point, you start shooting at people that have a higher intel value than the man you're going to try and save.
agent Owen knows the priority is to take all hostiles alive.
under fire?
no assignment's more difficult.
agent Owen has my full confidence.
Yeah.
if that were true, you wouldn't be standing here talking to me.
you offering to bring in Farhad?
Yes.
if you drop the criminal investigation against Renee Walker.
look, I know you don't want to prosecute her.
I can be your out.
I hear what you're saying, but I can't help you, Jack.
I've sat in that chair before.
the chair you're sitting in now.
I know what it's like.
there's a lot of demands on you, many of them unreasonable.
but the people that last here, the ones that mattered...
they knew when to say no.
it's the White House; you don't say no.
you are the head of CTU-- you've got a lot more juice than you think.
especially with a nuclear weapon in play.
if we do this, Jack, it's not for one rescue operation.
it's till this whole thing is over and done.
you want Renee freed up, you're not in and out anymore.
I want you in with both feet.
deal.
deal.
I found an NYPD evidence warehouse in Queens with $120, 000 from a drug bust just sitting there.
it was only a matter of getting them in and out between patrols.
wait, you actually committed a robbery?
put yourself in my place, Cole.
Kevin was going to tell Hastings I'm a convicted felon.
he was going to ruin my life.
what would you have done?
not this.
Kevin promised that if I went along, he would never bother me again.
let me guess.
he didn't keep his end of the bargain.
that's why you're here, isn't it?
what do you mean?
what's in your hand?
you were going to kill them.
I don't know what I was going to do.
you were going to shoot them in cold blood.
Cole, listen to me.
I was wrong.
I see that now, but I was scared.
I thought that I was doing this for us.
for us? Are you out of your mind?
I love you, Cole.
don't say another word.
not one more word.
Cole, where are you going? Cole!
stay in the truck.
Cole, don't do this.
please, I am begging you. This is my problem, not yours.
stay back.
what?
Yeah, go for it.
that way, I only have to deal with one of you losers.
I think you got the wrong address, pal.
Oh, do I?
somehow, I don't think so.
Hey, maybe you should just tell us what it is you want.
maybe you should shut up and listen.
Cole, please, come on. Let's just get out of here.
I thought you looked familiar.
looky here, Nick.
it's soldier boy.
no kidding.
you know, it's a shame that you and I can't go grab a beer sometime.
you know, just the two of us.
I'm sure we'd have a lot to talk about.
I said shut up.
now, the way I see it, you guys have two choices.
one, you go back to prison for grand larceny and aggravated assault.
I go back to prison, she goes back to prison.
my guess is, she's prepared to live with that.
choice number two: I let you walk.
you keep your 100 grand-- or what's left of it
and you go back to wherever it is you came from.
that's it? - That's it.
but if I ever see you in this city again...
if I even hear about you crossing the state line,
I'll skip the formalities and kill you myself.
do we have a deal or not?
Yeah.
we got a deal.
better be sure.
I don't want to see either one of you ever again.
Hey, what are you doing? - Going after him.
Why?
Oh, we get rid of him, we're right back in business with her.
come on, man.
we got what we came for.
we got more.
now, let's just...
let's not push our luck. All right?
come on, all right?
we're just getting started.
we're done.
okay?
you got me?
what you did back there, I'll never forget it.
let's just get back to CTU.
Cole, I'm serious.
thank you.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have come back.
Cole, he's dead. Just go.
nobody knows you had anything to do with this.
I don't want you involved.
I'm already involved.
we're cleaning this up, and no one's never gonna know what happened.
they're scum, Dana, and no one's gonna miss 'em.
Kayla may be in danger. She's run away. With Tarin.
she's somewhere in the city with no idea that a nuclear threat exists.
and, Omar, what about you?
don't worry about me.
just help me find our daughter.
come inside.
they have the rods you are looking for.
I thought you had the rods.
they turned against me.
I can help you find them.
just get me out of here.
you find Farhad? - Still looking.
he won't get far.
medic! Come on! Medic!
I need you to identify the men who stole the nuclear rods from you.
can you do that for us? - Yes.
blood pressure's dropping. We got a rapid heartbeat.
we lost him. Farhad's dead. - Damn it!
whoever shot Farhad couldn't confirm that he was killed.
I'm saying that we use Farhad as dead bait.
leak it to the press that we've got him in custody, and he survived, and they'll have to make a move on him.
tell the support teams it is imperative that we take these terrorists alive.
go! Go!
it's all right. We just want to talk to you.
no. No!
he's still moving. Notify the perimeter.
it was a trap. Farhad was already dead.
I locked myself in some kind of oxygen chamber.
they can't get in here.
you know what you must do.
I can't. They scrambled the arming code.
you need to set it off manually.
you cannot let them take you alive.
can you hear me?
what's the status?
the hyperbaric chamber is one-inch steel all around.
hermetically sealed, air and power systems are internal.
also, its atmosphere is most likely oxygen-enriched.
anything we use to blow the door could ignite a fire inside.
how long will it take to cut in?
we need to use a low-speed drill to avoid sparks.
how long?- Best estimate
40 minutes, unless you want us to push the risk.
I can't take the chance. We need him alive.
agent Bauer, the techs have got the internal cameras online. We have eyes on him.
what about the intercom?
the intercom's still down from when he shorted out the locking mechanism.
and the bomb techs say we have a bigger problem.
what?
they assumed that once we jammed the signal to the detonator, it'd be impossible for the suspect to explode the vest.
turns out that may not be the case. - He's reconfiguring the circuits.
Yeah. The detonator's German military, so our guys are familiar with it.
the end-around he's sketched out here will work.
what's the timeframe? - Well, it depends on how fast he works.
he needs to reset four circuits.
that LED light indicates he's already completed one.
when he wires the other three, he'll be able to explode the device at will.
the only upside is the chamber will contain the blast. No one else will be hurt.
he's not trying to hurt anybody.
he's trying to make sure we don't take him alive.
get that intercom up and running. I need to talk to him as soon as possible.
sir. - This is Bauer. Let me speak to Hastings
so, what have you got, Jack?
it looks like our suspect might be able to get the detonator working before we can get to him.
Owen will fill you in on the details. Right now, I need to know everything you've got on him.
I'm just pulling up the information now, Jack.
it took a while to get it from Hassan's intelligence people.
just give me the overview.
okay, Marcos Al-Zacar was born here, raised in East Harlem.
mother's American, father was from the IRK-- that's where Al-Zacar got his politics from.
his father was a professor known to be highly critical of American foreign policies, suspected of connections with extremists.
he was imprisoned by Wayne Palmer's administration for four months.
although the charges were eventually dropped, he was unhireable after that.
almost a year later, he committed suicide.
that must have been what triggered Al-Zacar.
he started spying on America for the IRK two months after that.
what about the mother?
ARLO: Checking current records.
according to motor vehicle and utility records she's still in East Harlem.
4211 East 117th Street.
find her and get her here as soon as possible.
we're on it, Jack. Keep us posted.
copy that.
we have to assume the people building this dirty bomb want to hit a high-value target here in Manhattan.
but first, they've got to get it on the island.
we should shut down the city?
no. We want them to make the attempt to move the radiological materials.
it's our best chance of catching them.
first, we have to make sure that all of our radiation sensors are strictly monitored at all crossings.
Arlo, that goes for the drone sensors, too.
Yes, sir.
that's all.
Cole? - We went over this.
all we have to do is act natural.
keep our heads. You'll be okay.
I am not worried about me.
you can't really be this calm after what just happened.
you've never broken a law in your life.
what do you want me to say? - I don't know!
anything. Tell me you hate me.
tell me that you'll never forgive me for lying to you.
we're not doing this now.
I told you to walk away... - Not now!
we're in the middle of a radiological threat.
we got jobs to do.
when it's over, then we'll talk.
look, I can't promise things are going back to the way they were.
but I wouldn't have done what I did if I didn't still love you.
you two have holy hell to answer for.
sir, I'm sorry. I can explain... - Save it.
if you were following up a lead, you should have been updating me every 20 minutes.
you broke protocol.
the lead didn't pan out. Witness proved to be unreliable.
but you're right, sir, there's no excuse. I should have called in.
and you were supposed to be servicing a faulty relay station.
yet I see you found time to change your clothes.
look. I don't know what's going on with you two and, frankly, I don't care.
if we weren't at high alert, and you weren't the best at what you do, you'd both be out on your asses for this.
I'm going to ask you once.
whatever it is, are you finished?
Yes, sir. - Good.
Walsh, until further notice, you will answer to Chloe O'Brian.
she will fill you in on what she needs from you.
Bauer has a situation at St. Julian's Hospital.
I need you to assemble a team, pick up an Elaine Al-Zacar from East 117th and take her to him.
is she a hostile?
unclear. Arlo will fill you in on the details.
Yes, sir.
how you perform from this point will determine whether or not you salvage your careers.
now, get to work.
yes?
I'm in place.
I've managed to tap into the hospital's security cameras.
but we can only pick up audio in the hallway outside the room.
CTU has set up a command center there.
can you see Marcos?
Yes. He's still working on the detonator.
are you able to gauge his progress?
he already has one of the four circuits reconfigured.
we're arriving at the landing now.
soon we'll be able to transport the rods into Manhattan.
are CTU's radiation sensors down?
not yet. But we'll be ready.
call me when Marcos is dead.
port Authority's reporting no hits on the radiation sensors at the Holland, Midtown and Lincoln Tunnels.
I don't see any stream updates for the GW, Brooklyn or Queens crossings.
what the problem?
MTA's providing that feed on a dedicated sublink to prevent a server overload.
you can access it yourself on the system's Ethernet port.
so there's really no problem.
there's no way I could have known that since you didn't put that in your hourlies.
right. I will do that next time.
I know this must be hard for you, having to report to me since you've been demoted.
it's okay, Chloe, I deserved it.
Yeah, you did.
I just want you to know I'm actually glad you didn't get fired or anything and... Hang in there.
thank you. I appreciate that.
where are we on aerial detection?
I've got drones covering every inch of the waterfront with their radiation detectors cranked up.
if they try to bring the fuel rods into the city by boat, we'll spot them.
easily.
look, I know you probably hate my guts right now, but I just wanted you to know that I'm sorry.
for telling Cole about you and that other guy.
I mean, you were definitely messing up, and with the threat of those rods out there...
don't worry about it, Arlo.
so is he gone?
who? - You know. The other guy.
Yeah.
Yeah, he's gone.
so, you and the Boy Scout are okay?
we'll get through it.
I'm glad.
but if for some reason that changes... - I know.
meaning, if you ever decide you want to trade up... - I got it.
sir, we got the intercom to the chamber working.
you should be able to talk to the suspect.
good. Tell CTU I'll keep my comm up so they can monitor.
Yes, sir.
Marcos, my name is Jack Bauer. I'm working with CTU.
I know the original plan was to smuggle the fuel rods back to the IRK to reconstitute their nuclear program.
so I'm just guessing that helping to deliver a dirty bomb to New York City which will cost the lives of tens of thousands of innocent people isn't exactly what you signed on for.
but the truth is if you do this, you'll be killing the IRK.
by bombing New York City, you're going to force President Taylor to retaliate, and she will, hard.
you can't possibly want that.
it doesn't matter what I want.
this so-called peace agreement, it's just Hassan signing away my country's ability to defend itself, its independence.
he's surrendering without a fight.
but there are a lot of people in his own government who are not willing to do that.
Marcos, you can't win this fight.
the IRK will sustain massive casualties because of this.
because of you.
not because of me.
america will be the one dropping all the bombs.
no, son.
the eyes of the world will hold you responsible for the innocent lives taken in New York City.
no, don't think you can take the moral high ground with me.
the arrogance of this country.
that it feels it can dictate to the rest of the world who gets... who gets to have nuclear weapons, while it insists on keeping my people in the Dark Ages.
you keep saying "your people, your country."
Marcos, I read your file. You were born here. You're an American citizen.
your father is from the IRK.
you leave my father out of this!
what happened to your father was unfair and tragic, but this is no way to honor his memory.
please, you can still do the right thing here.
you can help me stop this from happening.
all you have to do is open the door.
please, I'm begging you.
you're not going to get me to change my mind.
I came here prepared to die.
and that's what's going to happen.
please, just talk to me.
Yes, of course. I understand. We'll see you soon.
thank you.
your friend at the State Department-- you trust he can do what he says, give us asylum?
Yes.
he says with what your father has been doing-- ordering unlawful arrest and torture
u. S.law will consider us political refugees.
but you have to understand, asylum will not be granted overnight.
well, how long are we talking about?
a year, maybe 18 months.
but as soon as we file the application, we are protected by the law.
your father cannot touch us.
you know that I will not be able to work here legally until asylum has been granted.
I have some savings.
but I will not be able to give you the life that you have been used to.
Oh, you know I don't care about any of that.
one minute.
Oh... my mother again.
I really should answer it. - Kayla.
no, she deserves to know I'm all right.
give that back to me! Please.
you know what? You can call her when the lawyer has filed the application.
we must wait until then.
Bye-bye.
Kayla, it's me again.
darling, I need to talk to you.
your father told me something terrible may be happening here in New York.
please, call me back as soon as you get this message.
I still can't reach her.
thank you for coming back.
our daughter is missing.
I'm not leaving until I know she's all right.
we'll find her, Dalia.
Nabeel told me you had Tarin arrested.
I didn't know who I could trust.
so you started arresting people from inside your own delegation?
what possible evidence could you have gathered so quickly?
I had to do something. - But Tarin?
he's one of your most loyal men.
so was my brother.
or so I thought.
until he tried to have me killed and destroy my government.
if you continue to act the way you have been, you will have done the job for him.
have you told the police?
I've been trying to deal with it on my own.
but it's time to get them involved.
Dalia, I'm sorry. - As you should be!
this city is under attack! Our daughter is god knows where!
you drove her away with your suspicion and your paranoia!
how could you, Omar?
how could you have lost your way?
Dalia. You're right.
I have. I have. I see that now.
and I'll make changes.
I'll do everything in my power to find her.
and get her safe.
you have my word.
I am sorry. Dalia, I'm sorry.
who is it?
what do you want?
my name is Cole Ortiz. I'm an agent with CTU.
I need you to open that door, ma'am.
I don't understand. What's this about?
your son, Marcos. - Marcos?
ma'am, you're either going to open that door or I'm gonna break it down. Now!
go!
Mrs. Al-Zacar, are you aware of where your son is right now?
not at the moment.
how much do you know about his activities on behalf of the IRK?
uh... I know that he communicates with family there, if that's what you mean.
you going somewhere?
I was just about to leave to my sister's house.
you do that a lot, take trips to visit relatives at 2: 30 in the morning?
no, I don't. I can explain.
marcos called me about an hour ago.
he told me to leave the city.
he said he needed me to meet him at my sister's house in Pennsylvania.
he didn't tell you anything else?
no. I swear.
ma'am, right now your son's barricaded himself at St. Julian's Hospital, trying to blow himself up with a suicide vest.
Oh, my God. No!
I need you to come with me to St. Julian's-- ma'am.
we don't know how much longer we have till your son can activate the explosives; we have to go.
yes?
sir, Cole just checked in. He's got Al-Zacar's mother and he's on route to St. Julian's now.
what's his ETA?
less than ten minutes.
all right, then. Thank you.
sir, I would like to apologize again for leaving my post. I know that I let you down.
Yes, you did.
I brought you in and gave you this promotion because I saw something in you, not just your skill, which is considerable.
but an ability to adapt to any situation, drive to be better, attributes that make you a good leader.
or did I misread that? - No, sir.
so we can chalk up the last several hours to a serious lapse in judgment?
what I was... - Look.
I don't want to lose you or Cole.
you're both valuable, but everyone is replaceable.
I screwed up and I'm willing to accept the consequences.
I know that Cole feels the same way.
thank you, sir.
Hello?
can I ask who I'm speaking with?
excuse me?
would you mind telling me your name, please?
this is Dana Walsh. Who is this?
forgive me, Miss Walsh, for calling at this ungodly hour.
I actually expected to leave a message.
I'm sorry if I woke you.
no, no, that's okay. I'm actually at work.
what is this regarding?
well, my name's Prady.
I'm with the Department of Corrections down in Little Rock.
I'm trying to locate an individual by the name of Kevin Wade.
I-I'm sorry.
who did you say that you were again?
bill Prady. I'm a probation officer.
Mr. Wade is one of my charges.
do you know him?
no, no. I don't think that I do.
well, that's peculiar since he dialed this number a few days ago from a motel room in Queens.
probably just a misdial.
no. Dialed this number more than once, and some of the calls lasted more than a couple of minutes.
look, Mr. Prady, I am really busy right now.
I work for CTU and we are in the middle of a crisis.
well, I completely understand. I've heard the news.
but since we're both awake, I wonder if I could meet with you in person.
you mean now?
well, I got an early flight to Little Rock in the morning, so, yeah, it'd pretty much have to be now, ma'am.
I'm sorry. I-I don't really understand why this is so pressing.
well, Miss Walsh, I've grown kind of fond of young Kevin, and the longer it takes me to find him, the harder it'll be for me to keep him from going back into prison.
I don't really see how I can be of any help.
Yeah, well, maybe not.
but we can determine that when we speak.
like I said, it won't take long.
look, if it'll smooth things over, I could call your supervisor.
no, no. That won't be necessary.
I'm sure that I could spare a few minutes for you.
thank you, ma'am. That would be super. Tell you what.
let me just pull over, and I'll get your address.
all right?
of course.
sir, according to the bomb techs, he's close.
getting that third circuit active was the toughest part.
the fourth is only a matter of rerouting the firing circuits.
what's the time frame?
ten minutes, maybe less.
how much longer is it going to take them to drill through?
too long. They're not going to make it.
get her some water.
take care of that.
did she resist?
not once I told her her boy had explosives strapped to him and was going to blow himself up.
she had a packed suitcase, Jack.
so he cares enough about her to make sure she got out of town.
what else does she know?
nothing, as far as I can tell.
and I didn't tell her anything more.
okay, good.
Mrs. Al-Zacar, my name is Jack Bauer.
I'm in charge of field operations here.
where is he? - I'm going to take you to him.
I want to see him. - I'm going to take you to him.
please sit down.
I need you to fully understand the situation.
please.
this is Ortiz.
Cole, it's me.
Kevin's probation officer just called me.
he's in New York, trying to track down Kevin.
I can't talk to you about this now. We're in the middle here.
listen to me.
I told him I didn't know who Kevin was, but... he caught me in the lie.
he has records that show him calling my cell several times.
Cole, this probation officer is on his way here.
look, you're going to have to figure out a reason why he had your number.
I don't know if I can do this.
what, lie? Come on, we both know you're good at it.
sorry.
look, you just have to handle this. Okay?
all right? - Yeah.
let me know what happens. I got to go.
I can't believe this is happening.
you need to believe it.
the men your son is working with intend on detonating a radiological bomb somewhere in Manhattan.
that's why your son tried to get you out of the city.
marcos has been an agent for the IRK, spying on this country since your husband died.
we have proof of that.
and now he's going to kill himself in order to protect this plot unless you can convince him otherwise.
what do-what do I say to him?
whatever you have to, to get him to stop rearming that vest, and open the door.
we need him to open the door.
do you understand?
if he does that, then what happens to him?
he'll be alive.
if he cooperates with us, I promise you,
I will do everything I can to help him.
I give you my word.
ma'am, I'm sorry, but we need to do this now.
we need the room.
now.
it's definitely her.
Marcos's mother.
you recruited him, Ali.
you know him better than anyone.
will she be able to talk him down?
he's loyal to our country.
I don't think so.
Marcos, it's me.
mom, what are you doing here?
Marcos, you have to stop this.
this is crazy.
you son of a bitch!
leave us alone!
you leave us alone!
Marcos, talk to me.
Oh, my God, Mom.
I told you to get out of the city.
I told you to go to Aunt Shelley's. Why didn't you listen to me?
I'm listening now.
you told me that you were going to meet me there.
I believed you.
I was trying to protect you.
from a terrorist attack?
that's what they say that you're involved in here.
something that's going to kill many, many people.
Marcos, tell me that's not true!
tell me!
Marcos, why?
you ask me that?
after what this country did to Dad?
Marcos, I loved your father. You know I did.
but he was a complicated man, and especially when it came to his politics.
but he never condoned violence of any kind, Marcos.
never.
he would agree with what we're doing.
you really think that?
he hated America.
and yet he came to America.
he married an American.
he had an American son.
honey, nothing is as simple as you're making it out to be.
Mr. Hastings.
I've registered a 12% degradation in the hospital's security feed.
can you boost the signal?
you're missing the point.
the indications are someone's tapped into the feed.
they can see everything we can.
I'll see if I can trace it.
I wish I'd done more.
I wish I'd helped you deal with your grief and with your anger.
no, don't put this on yourself.
you couldn't have done any more or been a better mother.
she's almost got him.
Jack, do you copy?
Yeah, Chloe. Go ahead.
the video feed has been compromised.
you're being surveilled.
I couln't trace the source
copy that. I'll take care of it from here.
Owen, how long will it take to disconnect the video system?
30 seconds. - Get on it.
what's going on, Jack? - Someone else is watching.
mom... I know what they want you to do.
but it's too late for that. - Don't say that.
you can still turn yourself in.
we'll hire the best lawyers, whatever it takes.
I'll be with you every step of the way. I promise that.
I'm sorry.
Marcos, I'm-I'm begging you.
mom, listen to me.
you got to be strong now.
damn it. No.
Marcos. Marcos, please. You're all I have.
please don't do this.
I love you so much.
I'm sorry. - It's over. Get her out of there.
I'm sorry. - Now! Move!
Marcos, No! No! No!
Marcos, no! No! No!
Samir, I just lost picture.
is his mother still in the room?
no, but he's still in there with one of the agents.
you detonate that vest, your mother dies, too.
what did you say?
you heard me.
I'm going to make sure your mother's in Manhattan when that dirty bomb goes off.
you don't even know what the target is.
I'm not talking about her dying during the explosion.
I'm going to personally escort her to the blast site, so she's exposed to the radiation.
I don't believe you.
you wouldn't do that.
you're a federal agent.
truth is, I'm not, really.
well, not anymore.
I'm more of a specialist that they brought in for today.
if you knew who I was, and things I've done before in my life, you would know that I'm not bluffing.
so, go ahead.
blow yourself up into a million pieces.
first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to make your mother come in here and clean it up.
and then I'm going to take her to the blast site.
do you know how long it takes a human body to absorb a lethal dose of cesium 137?
five seconds.
followed by 12 days of pain that's so agonizing, morphine can't even touch it.
you got a decision to make.
make it carefully.
you're not gonna hurt my mother.
I am done playing with you.
you look into my eyes.
look in my eyes!
you think I'm joking.
what happens to your mother is because of you.
only you.
if I open the door and I come out, you promise you won't hurt her?
you promise you'll leave her alone?
I give you my word.
Cole, I've got some action on the door.
put your hands up now!
walk towards me!
move!
down on your knees!
put your hands behind your head and interlock your fingers!
don't you move!
Cole, I got four lights on.
damn it!
Cole, I got four lights on!
we need bomb techs now.
the suspect's come out of the chamber, but he's managed to arm the vest.
I repeat: he has armed the vest.
we need bomb techs here to disable it now!
Samir, Marcos is out of the chamber.
What?! They must have talked him out it, but he's rearmed the vest.
you're sure?
he's still wearing it? - Yes, I think so.
hang up right now and transmit the fail-safe.
let's move!
keep you men back! I know the circuit pattern!
I'm looking for four common leads before I can disarm it.
what's happening?! What is that?!
Cole, they must have triggerd a fail-safe.
get you men back now.
move! Move! Move!
get this off of me! - I'm gonna try! Just stay calm!
mom!
get her out of here now!
Marcos, I might not be able to do this in time.
I need to know what the target is.
I don't know.
how are they gonna smuggle the fuel rods into the city past the radiological detectors?
I don't know, I swear! - Who does!
give me a name.
damn it, Marcos, give me a name!
president Hassan's head of security Tarin Faroush!
Tarin Faroush. Did you get that, Cole?
copy!
come on. Come on. Come on.
one more.
I'm not gonna be able to do this in time.
you tell my mother I'm sorry.
Jack, do you copy?
CTU, this is Jack.
marcos is dead.
I'm gonna need to speak to President Hassan.
commissioner, I appreciate that your NYPD's overburdened, but I would ask you to do whatever you can to have my daughter's picture circulated.
please keep me posted if you get any information regarding her whereabouts.
Yes. Thank you.
sir, CTU is routing a call to you.
from whom? - Jack Bauer.
Yes, Mr. Bauer?
this is President Hassan.
Mr. President, I was told you were briefed on the situation at St. Julian's Hospital.
I was. - Sir, the suicide bomber is dead.
his explosive vest was remotely detonated.
then you have no leads.
no, sir, we actually do.
before the suspect was killed, he identified your head of security, Tarin Faroush, as a co-conspirator.
are you sure about this? - Yes, sir.
right now you need to call UN security and have them take Mr. Faroush into custody until we get there.
that won't be possible, Mr. Bauer.
tarin's not here.
where is he? - I don't know.
somewhere with my daughter.
excuse me?
they are in love... so I've learned.
Mr. Bauer, I suspected Tarin hours ago, and had him arrested for questioning.
he escaped while being transported to our embassy.
Kayla believed he was innocent, and has, apparently, run away with him.
do you have any idea where they might be? - None.
can you contact your daughter?
my wife has made several attempts, but she isn't answering her phone.
sir, you need to keep trying. Right now Mr. Faroush is our only lead.
I'm going to jump in the shower.
Hello, Mother.
Kayla? I have her.
Mr. Bauer, - Darling, are you all right?
we have Kayla on line with her mother.
Oh, I'm fine, Mother. - Mr. President, you need to get me an address.
I'm sorry I've been ignoring your calls, but I know Father has put you up to this.
where are you?
you know I can't tell you that.
is Tarin with you?
not at the moment, no.
he doesn't want me to speak to anyone.
Kayla, listen to me, you are in danger.
Tarin is working with your father's enemies.
that's not true. It's Father's paranoid delusions.
it isn't. CTU just called to confirm.
they're on the line with your father now.
I don't believe you.
Kayla, please.
you know I loathed your father's behavior and the way that he's handled everything.
I wouldn't be telling you this unless I believed it, too.
not Tarin.
it has to be a mistake.
then we'll sort it out together.
but you must tell me where you are.
the Teodore Hotel, suite 514.
the Teodore, suite 514.
Kayla, darling, just stay where you are.
Mr. Bauer. - The police will be there shortly.
they are at the Teodore Hotel, suite 514.
thank you, sir.
please don't tell Father we spoke.
Kayla? - I love you, too.
Hello?
I thought we agreed you weren't gonna take your mother's call.
I'm sorry, my love. I just didn't want her to worry.
did you tell her where we are?
did you? - Of course not.
do you think I'm stupid?
you know I could never think such a thing.
you are perfection.
now come on. We must get dressed.
where are we going?
where do you think?
to formally request our asylum.
at this hour?
my friend at the State Department made the arrangements.
but I'm exhausted.
we haven't even slept.
I suppose you blame me for that, huh?
well, then... can't we have a little more time together?
no. Come on.
you must get dressed.
why don't you just get dressed here?
I'm just gonna clean up first.
he's in the Teodore Hotel, suite 514.
and Kayla's... Kayla's with him.
our men are clearing out now.
it's all yours.
where are we?
I could have a Tac team at the Teodore in 20 minutes.
no, NYPD can get there faster.
I want your men to set up a perimeter and wait until we get there.
if any of your men happen to come in contact with the suspect, it is imperative that they know we need to take him alive.
let's go.
let's get the other body and get cleaned up before we head back to CTU.
I'm trying to locate an individual by the name of Kevin Wade.
Kevin's probation officer just called me.
he has records that show him calling my cell several times.
look, you just have to handle this, okay?
I don't know if I can do this.
lie. Come on, we both know you're good at it.
put your hands where I can see them!
do not move!
Samir, Marcos is out of the chamber.
hang up right now and transmit the fail safe!
what's happening? What is that?!
Marcos, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do this in time.
how were they gonna smuggle the fuel rods into the city past the radiological detectors?
I don't know! - Damn it, Marcos, give me a name!
president Hassan's head of security, Tarin Faroush.
right now you need to call UN Security and have them take Mr. Faroush into custody until we get there.
tarin's not here.
where is he? - I don't know.
somewhere with my daughter.
Tarin is working with your father's enemies.
you must tell me where you are.
the Teodore Hotel, Suite 514.
just stay where you are.
the police will be there shortly.
I thought we agreed you weren't gonna take your mother's call.
I'm sorry, my love, I just didn't want her to worry.
did you tell her where we are?
of course not.
we're arriving at the landing now.
soon we'll be able to transport the rods into Manhattan.
are CTU's radiation sensors down?
not yet, but we'll be ready.
all right, listen up!
this is what we know.
IRK nationalists are targeting New York with a dirty bomb.
we have one lead: Hassan's former head of security, Tarin Faroush.
we believe he wants to disable our defenses so they can smuggle the bomb into Manhattan.
latest intel is that Tarin is staying at the Teodore Hotel with President Hassan's daughter, Kayla.
Kayla has been warned by her mother that Tarin is working with the terrorists.
she'll be trying to keep him at the hotel until our Tac teams arrive.
what's our ETA othat?
NYPD is approaching the staging area, CTU still ten minutes out.
Chloe, you liaise with NYPD.
actually, Dana is better at the inter-agency protocols than I am.
fine.
Jack Bauer's heading Field Ops, Dana's on point with NYPD, Arlo will run aerial.
let's get to it.
all the changes going on around here, who do I report to exactly, you or Dana?
what does it matter?
I just like to be clear.
the only thing you need to be clear about is that there's a dirty bomb about to go off in Manhattan, so just do your job.
drone's in position over the Teodore Hotel awaiting your instructions.
Kayla, we have to go.
nearly ready.
what was that? Are you all right?
it was nothing, I'm fine.
Hello? - The Americans got Marcos to talk.
he may have compromised you.
did the girl receive any phone calls?
Yes, one - her mother.
get out now. And bring her with you.
we're moving to the next phase.
I'll need a vehicle.
hamid is on his way.
Kayla, we must go now.
just one more minute.
hurry up, please.
Jack, I'm uploading Tarin Faroush's file to you now.
copy that.
okay, I've got it.
we're also gonna need hotel schematics and access to their security systems.
coming to you now.
target is in room 514. Hotel security is standing by to give NYPD access.
Jack, Brian Hastings. What's your ETA?
about eight minutes. Can you patch me through to our point man at NYPD?
we're doing that now.
name's, uh, Sergeant Amis.
sergeant Amis, Dana Walsh, CTU.
been waiting on you, Ms. Walsh. We're in our staging area already.
go ahead, Jack.
sergeant Amis, Jack Bauer. Our target, Tarin Faroush, is in room 514.
he has a female hostage, Kayla Hassan.
she's the daughter of President Hassan of the IRK.
we'll handle him, Mr. Bauer.
we'll make sure that girl doesn't come to any harm.
the priority is to take Tarin alive.
he's our only lead to a major terrorist threat against New York.
like I said, we'll handle him.
sergeant, don't underestimate this man.
he was President Hassan's head of security. He knows what he's doing.
I want your men to set up a perimeter and wait for us.
we're monitoring hotel security.
we'll give you a heads-up if we've got any action from the room.
Kayla, my friend from the State Department is waiting for us!
we must go now.
just one more second, please.
Tarin, what are you doing?!
stop this game. We walk out of here right now.
no, I'm not going anywhere. - Just move!
Oh, no! Where are you taking me?
believe me, the last thing I want to do is hurt you, but I will.
got movement on the fifth floor.
are you getting this, Jack?
Yeah, someone must've tipped him off. Sergeant?
Yes, I know, target's on the move. I'm going in.
negative. We're five minutes out. I want you to hold your position.
I'm on the ground, Mr. Bauer; it's my call.
no, it isn't, this is a CTU operation.
I am telling you to hold your position.
I'm going in. - Sergeant!
tarin's at the elevators.
lost picture on the fifth.
sergeant, target has taken out elevator security camera and is armed.
I am ordering you to stand down.
I'm right on him.
sergeant, that was an order!
sergeant Amis, can you hear me?
ser - Chloe, have you got anything!?
nothing.
shots fired, shots fired. We have shots fired.
all NYPD units report status.
repeat, report status.
this is Faulkner. I'm hit.
amis and Martin are down.
Where's the target? - He's heading toward the fire escape on the south side.
he's got the girl.
ESU, this is Agent Ortiz. Cover the south fire escape now!
medics, men down on the fifth floor.
that doesn't make sense. - What do you mean?
Tarin just took out three men. Why's he using the fire escape?
he should be heading down the stairs.
son of a bitch.
NYPD, target is impersonating an officer; he has the girl.
I want you to fall back and cover all exits.
I repeat, target is impersonating an officer.
cover all exits!
Chloe, do you see anything?
nothing.
send us back the drone feed. - Roger that.
drop the gun! Put it down!
drop it now!
this is Bellow. Target's at the Allen Street exit. He's got the girl.
Chloe, we need that drone feed.
coming through.
there's a cab pulling up.
officer Bellow, behind you!
they're heading for the cab.
all ESU, we have two officers down in the alley behind the hotel.
target is moving to Allen Street. He's escaping in the yellow cab.
tracking the cab.
TARIN: Go!
advise all NYPD mobile units, we cannot lose that vehicle.
on it. - Taxi's in the Delancey underpass. I'm blind.
do we have traffic cams?
not in the underpass.
we're two blocks from Delancey.
any sign of the cab?
still in the underpass.
the underpass is less than half a click. Where the hell are they?
NYPD mobile units, 90 seconds out.
go left, Jack, go left right here!
there it is. I got the cab. I got the cab.
driver!
I want you to slowly open your door!
open the door now!
it's empty. It's empty!
Chloe, backtrack drone footage.
trace every vehicle that left the underpass.
get NYPD to set roadblocks.
they were here less than 30 seconds ago!
arlo? - Got it.
we should join the sweep.
no, they're gone.
you don't know that.
Yeah, I do, they're gone.
Chloe, it's Jack, I'm gonna need a kidnap and an electronic intercept package.
have it meet me back at the UN.
copy. - I need to talk to President Hassan.
that's who the terrorists are gonna want to contact next.
that's why they kidnapped his daughter.
Tarin just called.
he has the girl.
hello. Ahman.
Samir, where are the nuclear rods?
they're still outside the city.
we haven't disabled the American radiological detectors yet.
then how will you bring the rods to me?
it's been taken care of.
we've backtracked through drone and traffic cam footage looking for Kayla and Tarin.
nothing's come up yet.
what's Bauer's status?
he's two minutes from the UN. An electronic intercept team is en route to him.
keep me informed. - Copy.
ms. Walsh.
there's a Mr. Prady here to see you.
says he spoke to you on the phone.
thank you.
would you mind covering for me for a few minutes?
Mr. Prady. Dana Walsh. - A pleasure, Ms. Walsh.
it'll be quieter in heee.
uh, this is, uh... this is some impressive facility.
what, uh... what is it you do here?
intelligence analyst.
Mr. Prady, we've got a major situation here... - I understand.
I won't take up much of your time.
okay.
it's 3: 00 in the morning, you're 2, 000 miles from home.
you mind telling me what's so urgent?
Yeah. It's about the young man I mentioned on the phone - Kevin Wade.
this is him right here.
you know him, don't you?
Yes.
I should have been honest with you on the phone.
I met Kevin a couple days ago at a bar.
was there another man with him?
he was traveling with an ex-con named Nick Coughlin.
bad news.
done time on robbery, attempted murder.
no. No, I've never seen him.
okay. So, what happened... with you and Kevin?
um... we talked for a while.
I drank more than I should, and we ended up back in his van.
you had sex with him. - Yes.
do you know where he is now?
no. I didn't see him again.
the whole thing was a mistake.
why so? - Because I am getting married in a few weeks.
it was the pressure.
I - I don't know.
all the wedding plans.
I went out for a drink.
I didn't intend to... Maybe I did.
I don't know.
I don't know anything anymore.
all that I know is that if my fianc?? finds out, he will never forgive me.
I'm not looking to ruin your life.
I just want to retrieve Kevin before he gets in more trouble than violating his parole.
I understand. I... I hope that you find him.
Yeah, thing is, Miss Walsh, I got a call a couple hours ago from my NYPD friend, Tom Hardiman.
seems like there was a... a break-in at a police evidence lockup.
again, bad business.
officer got beaten up, left in a coma, but guess whose prints were on the assault weapon?
Yeah, that nasty SOB, Nick Coughlin.
now, what I'm afraid of is... where Nick is, Kevin is, too, and I really need to find him.
and, like I told you, I only saw him the once.
I have no idea where he is.
and you're sure about that?
Mr. Prady, we are in the middle of a national security crisis.
I have to go back to my desk.
okay. Okay. I'm sorry.
perhaps, if I talk to your supervisor, he could let you take a few minutes off.
or I could wait here, stay out of your way till you have some time.
fine. You have to stay here, though.
of course. Okay.
I don't understand. The Americans knew where Kayla was.
how did they lose her?
before we blame them, remember...
it was our people- our own people- who kidnapped Kayla, not the Americans.
Mr. President, CTU is here.
Mr. President, I'm Jack Bauer.
you already know Cole Ortiz.
we deeply regret not being able to find your daughter, but I promise you, we're going to do everything in our power to recover her.
how did you lose her?
how did that happen?
Tarin had been warned, ma'am.
we arrived too late.
it was your people... - Dalia, please.
what do they want with Kayla?
we were hoping you could tell us, sir.
Tarin Faroush was your head of security, meaning he knows everything that you know.
he took your daughter because he's trying to leverage something from you.
do you have any idea what that could be?
I don't know.
sir, we believe the kidnappers will contact you directly.
we need to set up monitoring devices on your phones so we can track their call.
do what you need to do. Just, please, get our child back.
Dalia. Please.
thank you.
with me.
set up tech here.
don't. Please. Don't.
do what he says, and you won't get hurt.
who is he?
another traitor?
the only traitor is your father.
tie her up.
no. No. No. No.
do you recognize the number?
there isn't one.
Chloe, we've got a call coming in on the mother's cell phone.
we're working on it.
answer it.
keep them on the phone as long as possible.
yes? - Your husband is a traitor to the people of the Republic.
he alone has made our actions necessary.
he cannot be trusted.
where is my daughter?
I want to talk to her.
whether you ever see her again depends on what your husband does right now.
put him on. - Dalia?
they want to talk to you.
here, give me the phone. We need to be hearing this.
we're still working on it, Jack.
okay, we've got it. You should have audio.
this is President Hassan. Who are you?
I'm a loyal servant of the Republic you are trying to destroy.
now, shut up, Omar, and listen.
I want to lk to my daughter.
let me tell you what I want.
file 33. File 33.
that is the price of your daughter.
I don't know what that is.
you had to say that.
of course.
you're a vain man, concerned about appearances, and the Americans are listening.
but please... do not insult me by saying this again.
I won't say anything until I talk to my daughter.
fine. If that's what you want.
I'm sending you an IP address.
give it to one of the people listening in.
okay, got it.
don't hurt her.
it's me you want.
I told you what I want.
file 33.
I told you - I don't know what that is.
take me instead.
you have 15 minutes. No excuses, no stalling.
15 minutes or she dies here, like this, while you watch.
stop it.
I'll find the file.
whatever it is, I'll get it for you!
Mr. President, what is File 33?
Mr. Bauer, I've got Brian Hastings on the line.
Yeah. - Jack, you know anything about this file?
no, but I'm standing here with President Hassan. I'll put you on speaker.
go ahead. - Mr. President, this is Brian Hastings.
I have no intel on the file they're talking about.
can you tell me what this is?
sir, they gave you 15 minutes.
if you want to see your daughter again, you don't have time to waste.
Omar, what is this file?
show them. Show them!
Dalia, I'll do anything for Kayla.
I would give my own life. - Then give them this file.
sir?
put it up on the screen, mirror it over to CTU.
Hastings, are you seeing this?
Yes, I am.
Mr. President, this file appears to contain operational details of all U. S. anti-nuclear defenses.
that's correct. - Including our radiological detection arrays.
this is highly - classified DOD material.
I need to know how you got this.
how do you think, Mr. Hastings?
for 20 years, your nation has threatened mine with everything from economic sanctions to military attack.
so we gathered intelligence and found weaknesses in your defenses.
we did what any other country would do.
Mr. President, that file shows the fatal flaws of our nuclear detection capabilities.
if the terrorists were to get that, they could smuggle the fuel rods into Manhattan.
surely you understand, we cannot let you give that to them.
we're talking about the lives of tens of thousands of people.
and what of my daughter?
what of her life?
with all due respect, madam, your family brought this threat to my country.
we're doing the best we can.
Jack, you still on? - Yeah, we all are.
Jack, we may have a lead on the daughter's location.
Arlo isolated a subway noise from the video feed at the end of the transmission, cross-referencing it with the real-time train positions as of this moment.
there aren't a lot of trains this late at night, especially within the radius that they could have traveled to.
they were heading southeast when they left the hotel.
they've got to be near the F train stop by the Williamsburg Bridge.
copy that. Cole and I will head down there now. We'll bring Tac from here.
you need me to send a second team? - Yes, and aerial.
everything you've got. Have your men ready and assembled in five minutes. Right away.
Mr. President, we're going to need you to stall them when they call back.
how? - We'll set up a fake file that you can transmit.
they'll see through that, Mr. Bauer.
eventually, but right now we just need you to stall them long enough so we can locate your daughter.
stall them any way you can, but you need to make this work.
we will do whatever we have to.
thank you.
please, don't say... - Why are you doing this?
please. - Why are you doing this?
please don't say anything more. Please.
is there trouble? - No. Why would there be?
what's the problem?
they're never going to hand over that file.
they have to. - And if they don't?!
killing her was not part of the plan.
you were willing to die in Hassan's limousine earlier today.
you were willing to do anything for our cause. - I still am.
you assured me your feelings for this girl would not get in the way.
so tell me, do I need someone else to take care of her?
no.
stay strong.
we're almost there.
Arlo, what's the status on our target area?
still looking at almost six square blocks.
how far out are Jack and Cole?
six minutes.
that leaves us about 30 seconds to find her. We've got to narrow this down.
Where's the second Tac team?
leaving now.
uh... Dana? Huh?
who is that?
nobody.
Mr. Prady, this is a secure area.
if you're not gonna wait in holding, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
I'm sorry. I had a question.
and I'm in the middle of a situation. I don't have time.
well, I wouldn't be bothering you, but I just got off the phone with my NYPD friend.
he said I absolutely have to ask you about the security cameras at the police evidence lockup.
because you know what?
it turns out they malfunctioned for the exact duration of the incident.
well, somebody obviously disabled the cameras.
well, yeah, but not Nick and Kevin.
I mean, a crowbar is about as high-tech as those two get.
now, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
see, I'm thinking that someone must have helped them.
now, my friend says that all the raw video from every government facility feeds right here into CTU.
am I understanding that right? - Yes.
he also said - correct me if I'm wrong that the digital images are archived every eight hours, and metadata is that what it's called, metadata?
that allows you to trace the exact source of any service outage.
so, everything I need to solve this is right here.
you can get it for me, right?
Mr. Prady, we don't just give data to people off the street.
well, now, that's right. That's right.
you need, uh, an IDRAN - an Interagency Data Request Authorization Number.
Yeah, Hardiman gave me one of those.
he said everything should fit on a 100-gig thumb drive.
so is that going to be a problem, getting that for me?
no.
good.
they reprocessed the subway noise, managed to narrow down the search grid.
how big? - About 12 buildings total.
apartments, offices, retail. It's still too much ground to cover.
agent Ortiz.
Cole...it's over.
I'm sorry. I'm not sure I heard you.
the parole officer looking for Kevin is here at CTU.
knows about the robbery, the cameras, everything.
are you certain?
Yeah.
he's after the raw feeds. He's got an interagency request.
I'm going to give it to him, Cole.
I'm sorry to call you. I just thought that you should know.
why don't you wait? - Do you hear me?
he knows everything. He'll go to Hastings.
don't do anything. We'll talk about it when I get back.
I can't wait.
if you're here, you'll just get in more trouble trying to protect me.
I can't let that happen.
I love you, Cole.
you got a problem? - No.
good,'cause I need you to keep your head in this. You understand?
you got it.
Omar. - We're running out of time.
the technicians have prepared the file I'll be sending.
but these people who have Kayla - they won't believe a fake file.
no. But they might believe you.
you have a gift, Omar. When you talk, people listen.
you need to convince them, for our daughter.
say whatever you need to to buy time.
I have seen you move so many people.
you can do this.
I know it. - Yeah.
Mr. President?
I'm sorry.
it's time.
the deadline is here.
your father has not responded.
you hate him that much, you would do this to me?
Tarin... I don't want to die.
please.
then let us pray for once your father does the right thing.
Tarin, you can't let them do this.
I know you.
this is not you.
and I know in my heart that you love me.
in my heart I know.
and so I don't understand why...
nearly there, sir.
okay, the uplink's ready.
let's go.
stop them!
W - Wait, wait, wait.
follow me.
this way, come on.
my father will help us.
he's surrounded by traitors. We have to get to CTU.
here, the number is in this cell phone.
call them.
Tarin, no, no!
Tarin, no!
Tarin! No. Tarin!
Omar, what has happened to her? Did the Americans stop the call?
I don't know.
maybe they were afraid we'd hand over the real file.
they could have gotten our daughter killed.
why aren't we seeing anything?
we're not sure. Arlo's been scanning the audio source.
four minutes ago there was a spike- very faint- sounded like a gunshot.
did Jack hear anything?
no, but he's still a quarter of a mile out.
Mr. Hastings, you better take this. It's Kayla Hassan - she's in a car, she's escaped.
what?
go. - Ms. Hassan, Brian Hastings, Director of CTU.
you all right? - No, no, I'm not all right.
I'm driving.
they might be chasing me, I don't know.
where are you?
I don't know!
track her cell phone; patch Jack in.
ms. Hassan, we're tracking your cell phone right now.
do not turn it off. Just tell us what happened.
they tried to kill me, but Tarin got me out.
he found a car, but they caught us.
they shot him.
he's dead.
he told me to call CTU, that it was the only safe place.
ms. Hassan, my name is Jack Bauer.
we need to know where you were being held. - I don't know.
ma'am, look, I know you've been through a great ordeal, but please, this is very important.
can you at least try to remember what the building looked like?
it was dark, and it was empty.
it-it had a vault, like a bank, but abandoned.
Chloe, did you get that? - Got it.
you need to tell my father that Tarin Faroush helped me escape, that he sacrificed his life for me.
we've got the location, Jack.
republic Commerce Bank, 9621 East Broadway.
it closed a year ago. It's the only bank on the grid.
copy that. We're going to need drone support, and send a second team over to the bank.
we got 'em.
ms. Hassan, we've got you on First Avenue and East Fifth.
continue going straight, I will tell you when to turn.
okay.
you two cover this exit. When the second team gets here, you send them down.
Cole, you're with me.
let's take the door.
Chloe, it's Jack.
we're in the basement of the bank. There's some kind of tunnel system.
I've got the schematics, I'm seeing it now.
we're going to head down a spur southeast from the vault.
how many exit points?
two exits - no, three.
have the drone cover all the exit points.
Arlo, I'm sending you my screen now. Can you get eyes on all the exits?
Yeah, ascending to 5, 000.
ARLO: I got movement at the south exit.
I've got four hostiles approaching Division Street on foot, heading northeast. You copy?
Yeah. Cole, they double-backed up top.
Chloe, we're moving to intercept.
Where's Kayla?
she's approaching the tunnel entrance now; she'll be with us in two minutes.
security is standing by.
good work, people.
Dana... good work.
thank you, sir.
if you'll excuse me for a few minutes...
targets are heading north on Orchard.
okay, they're getting into an SUV, Jack. Do you copy?
Yeah. Just stay with them, we'll follow.
Owen, King, you're coming with us.
you take King's vehicle, you two double-back around Orchard.
Chloe, I've got a shot here for facial recognition.
send it to me.
it's Tarin Faroush.
ARLO: He's supposed to be dead.
Kayla said they shot him.
you did the right thing, Tarin.
I know.
she will die for a good cause.
Jack, Cole, come in. - Go ahead, Chloe.
we ID'd one of the targets. It's Tarin Faroush.
Kayla said he sacrificed himself to save her, but he's still alive.
are you absolutely sure?
Yes.
what the hell's going on?
the terrorists asked us to give them a file they knew we would never give them.
they never expected us to. Chloe, you got to put Hastings on now.
I'm on, Jack.
you cannot let Kayla Hassan in.
the terrorists faked her escape. They wanted to get her to CTU.
for what purpose? - What's the best way to disarm New York's radiological defenses?
taking out CTU. There's got to be something in the car, some kind of a bomb.
you need to stop her now.
where is she?
Oh, my God.
she's in the tunnel.
security!
security!
Dana, with me!
Chloe, the car that Tarin got into, where is it now?
crossing into Brooklyn, taking the first exit off the Williamsburg Bridge.
we cannot lose that car, do you understand me?
copy.
stop the car!
put your hands where we can see them!
Dana, call the bomb squad!
get out of the car!
take her.
bomb squad to the tunnel entrance.
get her away from here. - Hastings, have you stopped that car?
not in time, Jack. Hold on, just hold on.
it's an EMP. It's an EMP!
you need to shut down your systems to protect the drones.
there's no time, Jack.
get away from the car!
I can move it.
come on, get out of there!
get out of there!
Chloe, can you hear me?
those drones right now are our only way of tracking down those terrorists.
you need to pass them off to the NSA.
damn it, we're blind.
Chloe, did you cop... Chloe?!
what the hell is happening?
we need to contact NSA.
the terrorists just took out CTU.
can i assume there is no change In the status of president hassan?
I'm afraid not.
then he is still being held by terrorists.
if hassan dies, There is no treaty.
if i didn't know better, I'd think you were hoping for that to happen.
Jack thinks that someone inside of CTU is working for the terrorists.
Jack recovered tarin's cell phone from the crash.
if someone did call and tip him off, we can get the number off the memory.
it's dana's phone.
I spoke to hastings. He cleared me through.
stay where you are and keep your hands where I can...
she just entered the parking garage.
the only reason you've got any leverage right now is that president hassan is alive.
so stop screwing with me!
they are gonna force him to make a statement,
and then they're going to kill him.
just read the statement, no more.
you will renounce the peace agreement.
I will never do that.
he's stronger than we thought.
bury him ??
I will tell the world of his crimes.
this man is not our president!
he's an arrogant... - Jack, looks like samir's grabbed him.
we need you to get in there right now!
I have a visual on hassan.
ready to engage.
I'm sorry.
??
???
yes?
I have Jack Bauer on the line for you.
put him through.
???
madam president, I don't know what to say except that I'm sorry.
I trust there was nothing You and your team could have done differently.
no, ma'am.
president hassan was dead before we even got there.
then you don't owe me an apology.
I failed you, ma'am.
it was hassan's choice to surrender himself in order to save american lives.
it was out of your hands.
don't put this responsibility on yourself.
madam president, you need to keep this peace agreement alive.
there can't be any agreement When the irk is without a leader, Jack.
the hardliners there will take advantage of the vacuum, and reverse all the progress we made with hassan.
I'm gonna have to address the delegates in a few minutes and announce the dissolution of the peace summit, and, and formally release them.
ma'am, if you give up, it means they win.
I don't see another choice, jack.
I wish to god I did.
good-bye, Jack.
what's his condition?
he took a round to the shoulder, another through the abdomen,
but it exited clean.
bp looks steady. Look, we need this guy for questioning.
is he going to make it or not?
doesn't look like any vitals hit.
he'll live. - All right.
we'll transport him back to ctu. Medical will take him for now.
president taylor is going to formally announce the end of the peace conference.
Jack, you did everything you could.
it wasn't enough.
we should get back to ctu.
Why?
the fuel rods have been recovered.
the peace conference is over.
everybody who was responsible is either dead or in custody.
what's the status on samir?
he's still unconscious, but the emts say he'll make it.
okay, good. I want you to stay with him.
I'm handing over complete authority and responsibility for his transport to you.
are you heading back to ctu? - No.
we're going home. We're done.
Hastings is still probably going to want to debrief both of you.
I'm sure he will. He knows how to find me.
I'm sorry it ended up like this, jack.
me, too.
you're a good agent, cole.
I wouldn't be standing here without you.
thank you.
I hope everything works out. I'll pack my kit up downstairs.
madam president.
the delegates are assembled in the lounge, as you requested.
let's get this over with.
...discontinue the peace summit that was to be a cornerstone of her administration.
president hassan apparently had been kidnapped earlier, - And then taken to... - Jamot.
on behalf of my country, you have our deepest sympathy for this terrible tragedy.
though, on a personal level,I imagine you have mixed feelings right now.
beg your pardon?
Hassan had you arrested without cause during his purge of suspected enemies.
allowed you to be brutally interrogated.
I would think you have little love for the man.
president hassan was under tremendous duress, and he lost his way,
but i never stopped believing in what he stood for.
of course. I meant no offense.
I'm sure you didn't.
excuse me.
president taylor.
minister jamot.
if you can spare a few moments, i need to speak with you.
I will be happy to sit down with you after i have addressed the other delegations.
I know you're intending to announce the end of the peace summit,
but there may be a way to prevent that from happening before you do anything.
all right.
ma'am, what about the delegates?
just... just give me a moment.
let's go in here. - Please.
yes?
samir's men were all dead, thanks to the americans.
Samir was the only one left, but i took care of him.
so, there's no connection to us? We're in the clear?
maybe not.
there was a woman there who might have recognized me.
what woman?
she may be CTU-- I'm not sure-- But...
I've seen her face before.
where?
six years ago, when we were using that mobster, Vladimir Laitanan,
to smuggle military weapons out of the country,
she was with him.
are you sure it was her?
I don't forget faces.
where is she now?
in a taxicab, Just ahead of me, with Jack Bauer.
are they going to CTU?
I don't think so, no.
then, it seems unlikely she recognized you.
better not to take the chance.
I'll take out bauer, too, while i'm at it.
the americans believe the Irk were solely behind the recent attacks.
killing bauer and this woman would only alert them to the fact that others were involved.
how long before they discover that it was us?
it will take even less time If this woman remembers me.
what are my orders?
continue to follow them-- Keep them in sight
and i'll get back to you.
I don't have the words To tell you and Kayla how sorry I am.
I know you did everything in your power.
Jamot, i wasn't aware that you were here.
I only arrived a short time ago.
I want you to know that,
in our last few hours together, Omar expressed his regrets to me,
not the least of which was his treatment of you.
I appreciate that.
Mrs. Hassan, i realize our timing is intrusive,
but there's something we need to discuss privately.
did you find him, president taylor?
the man who killed my father?
Samir mehran. Yes.
he was badly wounded, but he'll live to stand trial.
and, believe me, he will pay dearly for what he's done.
Kayla, darling,
I need to speak with president Taylor alone.
give us a few minutes.
what is it that you wish to talk to me about?
Mrs. Hassan, as you know, For almost a year, your husband and I worked to make this peace agreement a reality.
now, in that time, i saw the kind of leader he was.
he managed against difficult odds to bring a fractious and contentious Parliament together.
but, now that he's gone,
your country is going to be thrown into turmoil.
I am aware of the challenges that we are facing.
why are you telling me this?
clearly, someone needs to take the reigns Of the irk government.
someone who believes in the same ideals and principles as omar hassan,
and who shares his strength.
minister Jamot believes that that person should be you.
What?!
I'm not the only one who believes it.
I've spoken to our delegation,
as well as with the other members Of our cabinet back home.
you represent our best.
our only real chance to preserve our government and your husband's agenda.
you are out of your mind!
I am no politician.
but you are a martyr's wife.
and history has proven that To be something far more powerful.
you have always been popular with the people.
the vast majority of them want peace.
they will rally around you.
the council of guardian will have no choice But to recognize you as successor to the presidency.
but I have a choice.
you assume too much of me, Jamot.
I realize that this is a lot to consider,
especially now while you're grieving,
but without a unifying figure to hold your country together, everything your husband worked for will be for nothing.
president Taylor, my marriage to omar was far from perfect.
we had many problems for a very long time.
I know only too well
how difficult it is for a marriage to survive a life in politics.
but through it all, i never stopped loving him.
or sharing his desire for better relations with the west.
if it is the will of my people And of my government, I will take my husband's place at the peace conference.
it will be my honor to stand with you.
we'll make the announcement together From the united nations.
Mrs. Hassan, Thank you.
she's going to do it.
Oh, that's incredible news, Madam President.
I want every delegate contacted personally.
tell them to cancel any plans to leave the country.
we are returning to the un.
Yes, Ma'am.
I'll also call ctu and implement those changes we discussed If i still have your permission.
that's your decision.
do what you think is best.
Yes, Ma'am.
Where's Bauer?
Jack left the scene, took Renee with him.
Hassan's death hit him pretty hard.
samir's been taken to medical to get patched up.
is he conscious? - Barely.
you let me know the second he's ready for questioning.
?? - ???
put him through.
this is Tim Woods with homeland security.
hold on. I'll put you through to Mr. Hastings.
Oh, no. Actually, i'm calling to speak with you, ms. O'brian.
me? Are you sure?
I know this is an unusual circumstance, So i'll get straight to the point.
president taylor and the foreign dignitaries are returning to the un shortly Where the president will announce her intent
to move forward with the signing of the peace agreement.
what?
excuse me, But how can she do that without president hassan?
I'm not at liberty to say just yet,
but our immediate concern is whether ctu is capable Of handling security for the rest of the process.
it's already been infiltrated by an enemy agent,
compromised more than once today.
we cannot have any more mistakes.
are you suggesting I'm responsible for those mistakes?
on the contrary.
I reviewed the hourly reports,
and from what i see, you've made some astute calls,
and have proven to be very resourceful Throughout this crisis.
okay.
so why are you calling me?
I'm relieving brian hastings of his post Effective immediately.
we're now in the process Of vetting suitable candidates to replace him,
but until we find someone, you'll have provisional command.
you're... you're putting me in charge?
for the time being.
I know your record at ctu's l. A. Branch,
and how important you were during the sangala crisis.
there's nobody in that building That has more experience than you do.
sir, you're making a mistake.
what happened with president hassan, and everything else weren't mr. Hastings' fault.
Chloe, i don't have time to debate this with you.
division feels you are the most qualified To step in, and i agree.
my decision's made.
now accept it, and let's move on.
does mr. Hastings know?
division's informing him as we speak.
just try to make the transition As quick and painless as possible.
I'll be in touch as soon as the president arrives at the un.
Yes, sir.
come in.
Mr. Hastings?
it's okay, chloe.
I just want you to know,
I don't think it's fair what they're laying all the blame on you.
everything that happens here is my responsibility.
the successes and the failures.
I recruited dana walsh into this agency,
so i let the snake into the garden.
I need to review protocols with you.
let's not waste any time.
did you live here long?
no. Just during my recovery.
you know, i still think i got some coffee around here.
what's her name, your granddaughter?
kim named her after her mom.
Jack, listen,
I know that we've said a lot of things to each other,
and you've made promises to me about...
I just Want you to know that i'm not gonna hold you to them.
it's been A terrible day, and i know That we-We say things in the moment, and i just... I don't want you to...
Hello?
somebody there?
take my briefcase to Marine one,
and tell the secret service i'll be ready to leave shortly.
and send Mr. Novakovich in.
Yes, ma'am.
Mr. Novakovich.
thank you for seeing me, Madam President.
not at all.
what can I do for you?
I just had a curious phone call From tim woods
indicating that you are intending to move forward With the peace initiative with the irk.
that's correct.
may I ask how you propose to do this, considering their leader is dead?
well, I intended to answer that question during my address to the Assembly, but since you're asking...
will be signing the agreement in her husband's stead.
that's... an interesting idea, Madam President, but I don't see how she would have the authority to sign such a document.
she's getting it from her government now.
their parliament called an emergency session to ratify her as provisional president.
the letter confirming that is forthcoming.
madam President, I appreciate your optimism, but I don't understand how you can believe that installing Hassan's widow as some kind of figurehead will alleviate our concerns about the instability of the IRK government.
???
the opposition will only get stronger.
Hassan's death will galvanize his supporters and every advocate of this peace process to endorse her as his successor.
you can't be certain of that.
once again, Mr. Novakovich, you're giving every indication that Russia has no interest in this peace accord.
I'm sorry that you feel that way, Madam President, but the fact remains that we are no longer confident that any meaningful progress can be made.
respectfully, my country will be declining to sign your peace document.
excuse me.
do I need to take this up with President Suvarov myself?
if you like, but I can assure you, I have full authority on this matter.
any decision that I make represents the formal position of the Russian government.
good day.
agent Peters, I need to see Secretary Kanin now.
Yes, Madam President.
liberty's on the move.
we managed to clear a blockage in one of your coronary arteries, and the X-rays show the heart muscle damage to be less than we expected.
in other words, I'm a tough son of a bitch.
you're a lucky man, I'll say that for you, Mr. Secretary.
I guess that means I can resume my duties.
although the procedure was noninvasive, I'd prefer it if you took it easy for a little while.
that isn't a no.
Hello, Ethan. How are you feeling?
well, uh, I've seen better days.
would you give us a few moments, please?
thank you.
you heard about Hassan?
tim Woods told me.
he also filled me in on the IRK plan to install Dalia Hassan.
what do you think?
her family's well connected and powerful.
I think it's an inspired idea.
well, the Russians don't.
novakovich told me in no uncertain terms they won't accept her.
they're using it as an excuse to pull out of the signing.
even if the IRK has a new leader, the peace agreement won't stand without Moscow's endorsement.
I need your help, Ethan.
you got the Russians to the table.
what can I do to keep them there?
there may be someone who can help us here.
but you're not gonna like it.
who?
Ethan, you can't be serious.
the man's a criminal. I don't care if he was pardoned.
I didn't agree with President Daniels' decision, either, but the fact is he's left several messages at my office over the past hour.
apparently, he's aware of the Russians' reticence in signing the agreement; he's offered his assistance.
how could he possibly know about this?
well, despite his political downfall, he's managed to maintain a uniquely close relationship with Moscow.
his messages indicated he has information which might prove useful in keeping the Russians at the table.
what information?
he didn't say.
I don't trust this man any more than you do, but I'd be remiss if I didn't urge you to at least...
hear him out.
okay, listen up, everyone, please.
I've never been very good at good-byes.
but I want to tell you what an honor it's been for me to have served with each and every one of you.
division is now vetting names to replace me.
in the meantime, Chloe O'Brian will be in charge, and I'm sure you will show her the same level of loyalty and commitment that you've all shown me.
thank you.
sir... - Aw, don't worry, Chloe, you can do this.
I hope so.
I just want to say, we had a rough start, but I eventually really enjoyed working for you.
well, I'm happy to say that I was wrong about you.
if I had listened to you in the beginning, maybe things would have turned out differently.
I doubt it.
I'll be at Division debriefing.
but I'm available to you if you have any questions.
thank you, sir.
good luck.
Mr. Hastings.
I have Agent Ortiz on the line.
they have a situation in Medical.
this one's all yours, Chloe.
ms. O'Brian.
Cole, it's Chloe.
Where's Hastings?
he's not here. What happened?
samir's just gone into cardiac arrest.
what? - I need four milligrams epinephrine and 275 lidocaine.
I'll be right there.
clear!
?? - ???
going again at 360.
clear!
what happened?
I thought his injuries were not life-threatening.
so did I.
where the hell is Hastings?
he's been removed by Division.
who's in command? - I am.
until they find a replacement.
you were with Samir the whole time?
all the way from the scene, yeah.
what about at the scene?
he may have been out of my sight for a few minutes.
emergency personnel were with him.
look, we got to move his body to the morgue for an autopsy.
not yet-- order a preliminary toxicology panel.
but they'll run a full panel during the autopsy.
I want it done now!
Chloe, he was barely conscious.
he couldn't have taken something to off himself.
no, but somebody could have given it to him.
do what she says.
I'll be in Hastings' office-- my office.
let me know when you find something.
a few of the more conservative members of our delegation may continue to resist you, but... we can...
we can persuade them.
perhaps if I spoke to them personally.
a very good idea.
miss Kayla, I didn't get a chance to tell you how deeply sorry I am.
thank you.
well...
I will see you both back at the U. N.
the U. N?
I thought you were going home.
no, not yet.
there are new developments. I'll explain them to you on the way.
what is going on, Mother?
why did President Taylor and Jamot want to speak with you alone?
they have asked me to consider staying on...
to complete your father's work.
I don't understand-- what does that mean?
our party wishes to appoint me as the new president.
what was your answer?
you told them you couldn't possibly accept, not after what's happened.
our country is on the verge of a coup by the people responsible for the murder of your father.
someone must lead.
you can't beat them, don't you realize that by now?
I don't believe that; I won't.
and the greatest blow I can strike against them is to sign the peace agreement.
this will be your father's legacy.
it will be a death sentence for you!
you want peace to live, but all these people want is anarchy.
Oh, Mother, they'll kill you!
enough!
you are not the only one who has suffered today.
this was not an easy decision for me, but it was mine to make.
I do not need you to remind me of the danger.
I need you to help me be strong.
now, pull yourself together-- there is a car waiting for us.
well, I'm sure the media does want a response, but I'm not ready to give them one just yet.
they'll have to wait.
all right. Thank you.
the press secretary says the Russians are already leaking to the news channels their intention to "reluctantly" pull out of the talks.
they don't like wasting time.
has my guest arrived?
Yes, Ma'am. I had Secret Service bring him in through the freight entrance and then deliver him discreetly to conference room number three, as you asked.
thank you, Tim.
Yes, Ma'am.
Madame President, let me convey my condolences on the loss of President Hassan.
I know you worked closely with him. This must be very hard for you.
thank you... for your sympathy, Mr. President.
if you don't mind, I'd like to talk to you alone.
this is my executive assistant, Jason Pillar.
I assure you he can be trusted.
forgive me if I don't give much weight to your endorsement.
he needs to leave.
will you excuse us, Jason?
let's get something straight.
I agreed to this meeting only at the behest of Secretary Kanin.
now, I'm not sure you're entirely aware of the situation.
my understanding is the Russians are rejecting Dalia Hassan as a legitimate successor, and as a result, she won't sign off on the peace agreement.
you're well informed.
I have close friends in Moscow.
in some ways, people there appreciate me more than people in my own country.
it wasn't their constitution you trampled.
the Russians have been trying to back out of this agreement from day one.
do you honestly think your relationships can change their minds?
I'm certain I can.
how?
let's just say I'm going to be able to exercise some leverage.
what kind of leverage?
if it gets the job done, does it really matter?
it does to me.
I can promise you no laws'll be broken, nothing will tarnish you or your presidency, but the details really must stay between me and the Russians.
you and President Hassan created the framework for the most significant peace in a generation, and you got the entire world behind it.
to let the Russians tear down what should be the crown jewel in your administration...
don't play me.
this is about you trying to repair your reputation.
is that so hard to understand?
you participated in a conspiracy to cover up the assassination of David Palmer.
I was trying to protect the country from an unnecessary trauma...
don't! You were doing what was best for yourself.
Yes.
you're right, Madam President.
you're right.
I suppose I've spent so many years trying to justify my actions that it's become difficult for me to own up to the truth.
I made mistakes, terrible mistakes, that stained the office of the presidency...
and for which I will be paying the rest of my life.
but I still can be of value to my country.
I can still do some good.
look, we both know you wouldn't have called me unless you were out of options, so we can continue to dwell on the past, or you can let me pursue the only chance you have of resurrecting the peace process.
please.
let me help you.
all right.
thank you.
what do you intend to do first?
arrange a meeting with the Russian delegate Novakovich.
uh, get a message to him at his hotel.
tell him that you are sending over your official emissary to have a talk with him.
what if he doesn't agree to this meeting?
make sure he knows it's me. He'll agree to it.
God help you if you make me regret this.
you okay?
perfect.
promise? - Hmm.
I am so thirsty.
me, too.
do you want me to get you something to drink?
sure. - Okay.
I'll be right back.
don't move.
Jack, your cell's ringing.
don't worry about it, let it go.
hello. Jack's phone.
Renee, it's Chloe. I need to talk to Jack.
what's wrong?
Samir Mehran is dead. I think he was assassinated.
what do you mean, assassinated?
I ran a preliminary toxicology report.
it showed traces of an unidentified toxin in his bloodstream.
someone must have injected him with it, probably at the scene.
there was, there was an EMT there. He looked familiar.
there was so much going on, I-I didn't take much notice.
familiar? From where?
I need you to get my FBI case files.
get me everything you have on Red Square.
you think he was from the Russian Mob?
he looked like somebody who was with Vladimir Laitanan during the time I was under.
that was six years ago. Are you sure?
honestly, no.
just send me the case files, all the surveillance photos that were taken, and I'll see if he's in there.
okay.
Jack... you need to hear this. Samir...
Jack. - Renee, are you there?
don't talk, I'm gonna get you to a hospital.
did something happen?
who is this? - It's Chloe.
Chloe, it's Jack. Renee's been hit by a sniper through the window of my apartment. We're still taking fire.
I need a trauma team at St. Andrew's now.
hold on, stay with me.
come on. Let's go.
keep everybody in the lobby. There's a sniper outside. Call 911.
now!
move!
she's been shot; we need to get to the hospital
St. Andrew's Hospital, 22nd and Ninth.
come on, you can make it.
wait... just wait...
we're gonna make it.
we're gonna make it, I promise.
do whatever you have to! We've got to get to the hospital now!
come on, come on.
I got you, I got you. I got you.
you'll be all right. We're almost there.
they're a few blocks from your hospital and should be there any minute.
please make sure she's given priority care.
thank you.
Arlo, pull up satellite.
isolate the areas between Eighth Avenue and West 18th Street.
what's going on?
Renee Walker was just shot.
What?! - Just do what I asked.
Jack said the sniper was positioned at his apartment at 1145 West 18th Street.
roll back the feed three minutes.
is she gonna be okay?
he's rushing her to the hospital now.
I don't get it. Why would anyone want to kill Renee?
help! She's been shot! There's no exit wound!
we got a gunshot wound to the chest-- let's move.
???
what's her pulse?
110, respiratory is still ragged.
check her carotid.
bp is 80 over 50.
???
right here.
what do we have?
five is prepped. - We're gonna take care of you.
O. R. five, let's go. - How many gunshot wounds?
one in the chest. - Sir, you need to stay right here.
is patient typing crossed? - No.
call the blood bank, send up four units of O-negative.
right away. - Come on, come on, come on.
??
Yeah.
Jack, it's Chloe. How is she?
not good.
we rolled back satellite to the area around your building.
the shots were fired from an office across the street.
PD reported finding a body at the scene.
what about the shooter?
we don't have anything. We lost him.
you were on the phone with her right before she got shot.
what were you talking about?
it's not important right now. Just... be with her.
she's in surgery, Chloe, I can't.
what were you talking about?
I told her what I'm calling to tell you.
Samir Mehran was given a lethal injection at the scene of his capture, probably to keep him from talking.
Renee thought she may have recognized one of the EMTs.
she didn't say anything to me.
she wasn't sure.
she didn't think it meant anything at the time.
where did she say she remembered him from?
from her days undercover with the Russian Mob.
she asked me to get her the Red Square file.
did you pull up the file?
Yes.
I gotta get back to you.
I'm sorry, she didn't make it.
there was just too much arterial damage and blood loss.
I'm very sorry.
someone needs to take the reins of the IRK government.
someone who believes in the same ideals and principles as Omar Hassan and who shares his strength.
if it is the will of my people,
I will take my husband's place at the peace conference.
did you find him, President Taylor-- the man who killed my father?
Samir Mehran, yes.
he was badly wounded, but he'll live to stand trial.
I took care of him.
so there is no connection to us. We're in the clear?
maybe not.
there was a woman there who might have recognized me.
what woman? - She may be CTU.
I'm not sure, but I've seen her face before.
once again, Mr. Novakovich, you're giving every indication that Russia has no interest in this peace ac
I don't understand how you can believe that installing Hassan's widow will alleviate our concerns about the instability of the IRK government.
I have close friends in Moscow.
do you honestly think your relationships can change their minds?
let's just say I'm going to be able to exercise some leverage.
Jack thinks that someone inside of CTU is working for the terrorists.
I spoke to Hastings. He cleared me through.
appenhend on site
stay where you are and keep your hands where I can...
she just entered the parking garage.
who are you, you lying bitch?
don't move.
you were on the phone with her right before she got shot.
what were you talking about?
Samir Mehran was given a lethal injection at the scene of his capture.
Renee thought she recognized one of the EMTs from her days undercover with the Russian mob.
I, I've got to get back to you.
I'm sorry. She didn't make it.
the following
sir?
sir, I'm so sorry, but we need to move her now.
sir, are you the husband of the deceased?
no.
well, we need to contact her next of kin.
can you help us with that?
do you know where her parents live?
are they alive?
I don't know.
sir, are you gonna be all right?
I don't know if these will fit. I got them from an intern.
thank you.
yeah?
Jack, I heard about Renee.
I'm so sorry. What can I do to help?
tell me who did this.
you told me earlier Renee thought she recognized someone at Hassan's crime scene. An EMT?
let us deal with that. We have everyone here working on it.
don't try and handle me, Chloe, not now.
who did she see?
she thought she recognized somebody from the Russian mob-- Red Square.
Bazhaev's group? - Right.
I want to talk to him.
like I said, I'm already on it.
he's in custody somewhere, Chloe.
I brought him in myself. Where is he?
there's something that you need to know.
division replaced Hastings... with me.
that means I'm responsible for what happens to Bazhaev.
I know you're upset about Renee. So am I.
but Bazhaev's our only lead. I need whoever talks to him to be in complete control.
I don't think that's you right now.
I won't interfere with your investigation.
you think you can stick to that? - I give you my word.
Chloe, I'm gonna ask you one more time:: Where is he?
he's in federal court downtown. He's being arraigned right now.
KANIN: Plan was for this chamber to be full by now.
Ethan, what in the world are you doing here?
you should be resting.
the doctor said it was my call.
Ethan... - I'm fine.
I was thinking, Madam President, our discussion about enlisting Charles Logan.
it's done.
you've contacted him already?
he's on his way to talk to the Russian Foreign Minister.
that was fast.
the Russians were about to announce they were pulling out of the talks.
I didn't see a lot of options.
so, what's his angle?
madam President, you said he's on his way to talk to Novakovich.
how does he intend to get the Russians to stay?
I assume he uncovered something in his business dealings with them.
but you don't know what it is?
not exactly.
madam President, he's operating in your name.
shouldn't we find out?
I agreed I wouldn't.
don't ask, don't tell was the price for Logan's cooperation.
Mr. President.
the Russian people join you in mourning President Hassan.
his death was a tragedy for all peace-loving nations.
you can save your platitudes.
you want the truth.
why not... for a change?
espresso.
I assume President Taylor sent you here to bring my country back to the bargaining table.
she is going to be disappointed.
president Taylor lured the whole world here with the promise that Hassan had united the IRK, that there would be peace for the first time in decades.
well, now it is clear that was a lie.
there was no unity even with Hassan, and now that he is gone...
...his widow Dalia can pick up the mantle.
not in our estimation.
Hassan was undone by his own opposition.
how could his widow possibly succeed where he failed?
cause we both know the opposition that undid him had outside help.
nuclear threats, assassination plots against a heavily guarded head of state.
this was not some Third World malcontents lashing out.
this was a highly organized effort orchestrated by a major rival to the United States, a rival convinced that their best interest was to stop the peace process by killing Hassan.
if you are insinuating... - Insinuating, no.
I'm saying it was people inside your government, first among them you.
that is an outrageous accusation.
it's a fact for which I have proof.
I don't believe you.
well, that's your right.
but I'll tell you this: you don't want to test me.
because what I have, I will share with President Taylor if you and I fail to come to an understanding here.
espresso, sir.
at this point President Taylor knows nothing about any of this.
I didn't see what good could come out of inflaming the situation between our countries further, not without talking to you first.
and now I have.
the president's expecting me at the UN. I need to go.
what will you tell her?
what I'd would like to tell her is that
russia is back at the table and her peace process is on track.
but if neither of us hears from you before I get there,
I'm afraid what I'll have to tell her instead is the unvarnished truth.
Bazhaev, Your Honor. We'd like to waive reading.
judge: I'm sure you would, given the charges here.
I can tell you right now I'm gonna deny bail.
judge Ruffin, Sergei Bazhaev is a businessman with deep ties to this community.
judge: He's a foreign national.
attorney: That's true, Your Honor, but he has lived in this country continuously since 1985.
his entire family lives here.
in fact, several members of his family are represented in court today:
his wife, daughter-in-law, grandson, for whom incidentally he is the sole means of support.
judge: According to the charges, he's their sole support because he killed the boy's father, not to mention the other counts:
trafficking in nuclear materials, assassination, conspiracy.
like I said, I'm going to deny bail.
I'm remanding him to Marion immediately.
your Honor, may I have five minutes with my client, please?
fine. You have five minutes. Court will recess for 30 minutes.
BAILIFF: Clear the courtroom, please.
my client would like to have a word with you.
if you touch my family, I swear to God I...
you're not really sitting in the right chair to be making threats.
who shot Renee Walker?
I don't know that name.
she was a former FBI agent.
approximately six years ago, she worked undercover in your organization.
earlier today, she recognized one of your men as Red Square.
there is no Red Square. Not anymore.
let me explain myself.
this agent, Renee Walker-- I considered her to be my family.
so take a long hard look into my eyes and realize that I will have no problem taking out each member of yours before they even get home today unless I get the information I want.
whoever killed her had nothing to do with me.
enjoy your time at Marion.
I'll tell your wife and your daughter-in-law you said hello.
wait. Wait!
if I tell you, they'll kill my family anyway.
we'll provide them with witness protection. I give you my word.
Moscow.
the Russian government-- they're behind it, not me.
everything that happened today, all of it, was them.
who inside the government? - I don't know.
what do you mean, you don't know? You're talking about 100, 000 people. I need names.
I don't know names. They never let me get close.
the woman working for them arranged everything.
what woman?
the one they planted at CTU. Dana Walsh.
BAILIFF: Sir, let's go.
you promised.
you promised.
NERVE-WRACKING, isn't it? Waiting.
I only saw Novakovich's face, sir, but you definitely had his attention.
it's the president.
Charles Logan. - Charles.
Yes, Madam President.
I just got off the phone with the Russian foreign minister.
you did? And what did he say?
he said that the two of you had a very interesting discussion.
and that he would be coming to the United Nations in five hours with the Russian premier to sign the treaty as scheduled.
he also said the credit for that is all yours.
Oh, uh, he was in the mood to be convinced, Madam President.
Mr. President, Ethan Kanin here.
so you're back on your feet. - Yes. And I'm curious.
what did you say to the Russian minister to convince him to come back to the peace talks?
I told him that peace is in all of our interests.
seriously, I'd like to know how you did it.
madam President, those-those details are for me alone.
that was our agreement. Am I right?
Yes, you are.
so, Ethan, um, let's not do anything to-to sully our victory.
and it is a victory. For all of us.
it's a good feeling, isn't it?
what? - Being of service. To your country.
Yes, it is.
I'll see you at the UN shortly.
O'Brian. - JACK: Hey, it's me.
Bazhaev's family just left the courthouse. They're going to need witness protection.
I want you to pick them up and bring them in. - What did he say?
he said the people who are behind Renee's murder weren't Russian mob.
said they were people inside the Russian government.
he claims that Moscow is behind everything that happened today.
I thought the IRK opposition was trying to stop Hassan.
no, he said the Russians were just using them.
he didn't have time to explain why they don't want the peace accord to go through, but he did say something important.
he said Moscow's main contact on the ground was Dana Walsh.
Dana? You believe that?
that would explain how she managed to breach CTU.
anyways, I'm on my way in. I want to talk to her.
I'll set it up. - Thanks.
Cole, I need your help.
Jack's on his way here to interview Dana.
Dana? What about?
according to Jack, she's some kind of agent with the Russian government.
he says they're behind everything that happened today, including Renee's murder.
listen, if Dana knows who killed Renee or Jack thinks she's in any way responsible, there's no telling what he might do.
Jack respects you.
you might be the only one who can deal with things if he gets out of hand.
I know this is difficult for you, but during the questioning...
Yeah, I'll be there.
Thanks.
it's good to be back in the game, even if it is through the rear entrance.
president Taylor's worried about her image.
huh, believe me, I of all people understand that.
she can't keep you hidden away forever, sir.
that's right. Credit given where credit is due. Publicly.
that's our deal. - Yeah.
no, no, believe me, the president will be grateful to know.
okay.
who is that agent? I want him reassigned.
sir, that was one of my contacts at Justice just...
did you hear me? ! - Yes. I'll take care of it.
but we have a more immediate problem: Jack Bauer.
what does he have to do with any of this?
he was just downtown at the federal courthouse, the arraignment of a Sergei Bazhaev.
Bauer got to him behind closed doors and got him to talk.
how much does this Bazhaev know?
he knows about Dana Walsh, the mole the Russians planted at CTU.
I know who she is.
Bauer's headed to CTU, presumably to talk to her.
sir, my sources tell me Walsh hasn't given up anything about Moscow's involvement. Not yet.
but she knows enough to bring everything down.
if she gets in a room with Bauer...
obviously, that can't happen. We need to stop Bauer before he talks to her.
that won't be easy. He may have a personal stake in this.
apparently, he was asking Bazhaev about a Renee Walker.
she was shot dead in Bauer's apartment less than an hour ago.
sir, this could easily get out of hand.
you may need to ask President Taylor to intervene.
what are you suggesting, that I tell her the truth?
if she finds out what the Russians have done, she'll be furious I kept her out of it.
she might back out of our deal.
sir, you really need to stop Bauer now.
I don't see any other way.
you have to talk to the president.
Bauer torpedoed my presidency.
tried to ruin me; almost did.
there's no way I'm gonna let that happen again.
thank you.
Dana Walsh ready?
Yes, I'll take you to her.
I'm so sorry about Renee. I don't even know what to say.
Dana know I'm going to be interrogating her?
no, I didn't want to give her a heads-up.
good.
Jack. I'm sorry about Renee.
I have to leave the cameras on, Jack.
you think I'm gonna kill her?
I wouldn't blame you if you did.
if I wanted her dead, Chloe, she'd be dead.
I'm just gonna wake her up to the idea of it.
open the door.
what do you want?
I want to know who killed Renee Walker.
Renee's dead?
Yeah.
that doesn't make any sense. It...
it must have been a mistake.
no mistake.
I'm sorry...Jack.
really.
you're sorry?
you're sorry?
I want to know who the shooter was!
I want to know ordered it! I want names now!
stop him! - Let it play, Chloe.
you hit me, and you get nothing.
you think you get to make demands here?
I can give you the hitter, the man behind him, all the way up to the top.
I want more than just names. I want proof!
I have proof: an audio file, film.
where?
first I want my immunity deal back.
soon as I start talking, I'm dead.
your move, Jack.
if you lie to me...
I'll find you no matter where you try and hide.
you understand that?
good.
these last few hours, I wanted to tell you right away.
the delegates have voted unanimously to accept you as the representative of the IRK at the signing of the treaty.
I'm pleased.
thank you for all your efforts.
you're welcome.
there is one proviso, of course.
that my own country accept me as signatory of the treaty.
I know you've had very little time to pursue this.
Jamot and I have been making progress.
in the next hour, our constituent assembly will vote on the issue, but as we've already received pledges of loyalty from most of my husband's coalition,
I believe we have a good chance of success.
excellent.
Dalia, we might just make it yet. - We might.
madam President, Mrs. Hassan.
I need a word.
excuse me.
Logan wants to speak with you.
about what? - He wouldn't say except that it's urgent.
he's waiting in your office.
following President Hassan's death, the expectation was that the delegates to the peace conference would have to pack up and go home, but the latest rumors coming out of the UN are pretty sensational:
that Dalia Hassan might be stepping into her husband's shoes.
in fact, there are already street demonstrations taking place in Kamistan
Mr. Logan, the president is here.
thank you.
thank you for seeing me, Madam President.
Ethan said you wanted to speak with me.
um, can we have the room, please?
what's this about, Charles?
Jack Bauer-- he's out of control. He's already pressured a Russian mafioso in federal court, and now he's on his way to question a woman in custody at CTU: Dana Walsh.
why does he want to talk to her?
he thinks she knows who's behind the, uh, the shooting of a Renee Walker.
agent Walker?
she's dead?
how did this happen?
that's still being investigated, but in the meantime, what I'm saying is Bauer needs to be stopped.
Why?
you're going to have to trust me. What we need to do right now is lock Bauer down.
you better tell me exactly what's going on.
madam President... - No!
I won't do a thing about Jack Bauer until you tell me the truth.
elements inside the Russian government were behind both the assassination of President Hassan and the supply of nuclear material to his enemies.
the Russian government?
why do you think they're back at the table?
because I threatened to expose their role in today's events.
you knew about this and you didn't tell anyone?
I was trying to protect the president.
protect her?
you've compromised her hopelessly!
why didn't you say anything before?
I told you that I had leverage with the Russians. You-you must have understood it was significant.
significant, yes!
evidence of a sex scandal, some kind of financial malfeasance, not this, for God's sake!
if I find that you were in a position to prevent anything...
absolutely not. This information came to me only very recently.
from whom?
I can't tell you. - You will tell me.
I can't, Madam President, because it would do no good.
my sources would plausibly deny even knowing me.
the Russian involvement-- that's what Jack Bauer is about to bring out into the open?
if he talks to Dana Walsh, yes.
the Russians inserted her at CTU months ago.
she was their agent.
if Bauer gets to her, it will all come out, and then, and then this, this will all be finished.
it's finished anyways.
do you think the president wants anything more to do with the Russians after what they've done?
Yes, yes, you do, Madame President, because you are looking at the bigger picture, the greater good.
how can you call any of this good?
because it is good, an undeniable good!
a peace that's escaped the world for generations!
that's what you're on the verge of achieving.
do you really want to throw it all away?
do you really think Dalia Hassan will sit down at the table with the people who murdered her husband?
who says she has to know?
believe me, I know how hard you worked for this, how you sweated and prayed, the sleepless nights.
I know.
the power to make a difference-- that's why we came into politics.
how few of us get to achieve it, but you have...
you so nearly have.
Ethan will tell you to make a stand.
I applaud his-his moral clarity, but then he's on the sidelines.
he can afford it. - That's enough!
is the situation ideal? No!
far from it, but you have a real chance to make the world a better place.
don't listen to this, Allison.
if the treaty's not signed today, it's not the end.
you can build a better peace, with honest partners.
there is a tide in the affairs of men, which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune.
what the hell does that mean?
the president knows.
it's from Julius Caesar.
it means "Now or never.
madam President, I have Jack Bauer for you.
where is he?
he's at CTU. He wants to talk to you about an immunity agreement for a Dana Walsh.
I'll have to call him back. - Yes, ma'am.
madam President, there is no choice here.
but there is a choice, Ethan, and unfortunately, only I can make it.
I'm going to CTU.
to do what?
to see Jack Bauer.
has the president called back yet?
not yet.
Jack, are you sure you want to do this to yourself?
we can take it from here.
the minute Dana's immunity deal is back in place, we can roll up the names, close this out.
I need to see this through.
excuse me. The president's on the phone, line 3.
she asked for Chloe.
madam President.
ms. O'Brian, I'm on my way to see you.
you're coming to CTU? - Yes, I'm almost there.
I need to talk to Jack Bauer. Make sure he doesn't leave.
Yes, ma'am.
let Security know the president will be here any minute.
she's coming here? - That's what I just said. Have them standing by.
Why's she doing this?
she said she wants to talk to you. - Why doesn't she just talk to me on the phone?
I don't know.
you should probably meet her in Hastings' office.
fine.
Madame President, welcome to CTU. I'm Chloe O'Brian.
thank you, Ms. O'Brian. Is Jack inside?
right this way.
I want to say how grateful I am for all your efforts today.
we've taken some pretty hard hits, but we've managed to keep ourselves in the game.
the peace process is still alive, and I am counting on your hard work and your vigilance to keep it that way.
I know you won't let me down.
thank you, Miss O'Brian. Um, I'll go up alone.
Hello, Jack. - Madam President.
I am so sorry about Agent Walker.
I gather she meant a lot to you.
Yes, ma'am.
which makes what I'm about to ask so very, very hard.
please, Jack.
I need you to stand down.
I-I'm sorry. I don't understand.
I do not want you to question Dana Walsh.
madam President, the information that I can extract from Dana Walsh is not limited to the murder of Renee Walker.
I believe she knows the names of the people who facilitated the assassination of President Hassan, people working within the Russian government.
that is pure speculation.
then grant her immunity. Let me question her.
if she's lying, you lose nothing.
I'm sorry.
I won't give Dana Walsh immunity. I can't.
the peace process is back on track.
Dalia Hassan will represent her country at the signing.
the Russians have accepted her and have undertaken to support the treaty.
madam President, the Russians have been trying to destroy the treaty. You can't trust them.
you don't know that.
the information that I have came from Sergei Bazhaev, and I believe him.
if you let me question Dana Walsh, I can prove it to you.
no.
I won't allow it.
you don't want to know the truth.
what I want is to keep the Russians at the table.
allegations of this sort will drive them away.
what if the allegations are true?
if I keep the Russians at the table, I can bring peace to a part of the world that has known nothing but war for generations.
that is the greater good that I am working toward.
and to achieve it, there have to be sacrifices!
with all due respect, Madam President, these people gave nuclear weapons to terrorists who were willing to obliterate half of Manhattan!
you don't know that!
and I'm telling you, we have to move on.
even Hassan's widow has picked up the torch and is continuing the peace process.
does she know the Russians helped murder her husband?
do you think she'd be willing to sign that treaty if she knew that? Have you even told her?
that's enough. - Have you told her?
I said that's enough!
this peace treaty is in the interests of the United States and of the world.
that makes it a good in itself, and certainly more important than your desire for revenge.
madam President, I don't want revenge; I want justice.
and I want peace.
if there were another way, I would take it, but there's not.
that's my decision.
do you understand?
do you understand, Jack?
Yes, ma'am.
I've arranged a helicopter to fly you from CTU to McGuire Air Force Base.
you're locking me down.
you'll be debriefed there.
good-bye, Jack.
I'm sorry.
I had them gather your things.
Thanks. - What happened up there?
nothing. - What do you mean?
I mean nothing. Nothing happened.
what I need is a meeting with Dalia Hassan to coordinate our response to the likely questions.
will you set that up?
thank you. I'm leaving CTU now.
I'll be with you in ten minutes.
they said you wanted to see me. - Yes.
Dana Walsh is to remain locked down until further notice.
no one gets access to her without my express permission.
is that clear? - I guess.
what about Jack?
Jack is going to McGuire Air Force Base to be debriefed.
he didn't seem very happy about that.
he was disappointed that I wouldn't grant Dana Walsh immunity in exchange for her testimony.
but Dana knows who's responsible for everything that's happened today.
she is a sociopath.
she'll say anything.
and the last thing we need right now is a bunch of unfounded allegations derailing the peace that we've all worked so hard for.
do you understand, Chloe?
we're having a press conference at the UN in two hours to present Dalia Hassan as the new leader of the IRK and to announce that the peace talks are still on track.
what we need CTU to do is to make sure security is airtight.
Yes, ma'am.
tim Woods speaks very highly of you.
when the situation got out of control, he was quite adamant that you were the one to take over.
I'm surprised he even knows who I am.
it was a pleasure to meet you finally, Chloe.
thank you.
Cole, we're gonna be back on UN detail.
what's happening with Dana?
as of now, nothing.
what about the immunity agreement? - There isn't gonna be one.
why not?
the president says that Dana's a lying sociopath who will wreck the peace treaty.
what's Jack say about that?
I don't know. He's being choppered to McGuire for debriefing.
Chloe, what the hell's going on?
there's gonna be a press conference soon, and the president needs us to guarantee security.
you'll need to get your teams ready.
okay. Fine.
so Jack's being taken away for a debrief?
about what, may I ask?
no.
director O'Brian, this is Falcon One. We're touching down at CTU, ma'am.
copy that. Security personnel en route to the roof with Jack Bauer now.
copy that
Mr. Bauer, Agent Winnick.
the White House has instructed me to escort you to McGuire Air Force Base for a debrief.
heard a lot about you, sir.
I'm sorry we had to meet under these circumstances.
there's no reason to be sorry.
get in this helicopter.
tell your men to drop their weapons or you're gonna die.
Arlo, pull up the audio. Something's happening.
coming up.
put your weapons down now!
I will kill him! - Everyone to the helipad.
all security to the helipad now. - What the hell is going on?
he's gonna steal that helicopter. We have a hostage situation.
out of the copter now!
Bauer took a hostage. Hijacking the helicopter.
hold your fire! Lower your weapons!
give me your walkie.
Jack. Please land the chopper now.
Jack, you know I have to call this in. The Air Force will force you down.
this is a bad idea.
land the chopper now.
call the FAA, the Air Force.
tell them we have a stolen helicopter flying west over Manhattan that needs to be intercepted and forced down.
Yes, ma'am.
do you realize this is the last time we'll be here...
...as six single people?
what's happening to the coffeehouse?
from now on, it's you four and me and the missus.
the little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.
old? - The young, hot ball and chain.
much better. - We gotta go.
where? - Get the dress and lunch with Mom.
Joey, you too?
I just heard "lunch.
Yeah, I can go. Sure.
actually, I'm glad they're leaving.
I need to talk to you about something.
what's up? - This may be a little awkward.
if you need money, it's a bad time. I'm buying 128 dinners tomorrow.
no, it's not that.
I'm not gonna say this as your friend...
...but as Monica's older brother.
but you're still my friend? - Not for a few minutes.
right now, are you still my best man? - No.
do I still call you Ross?
you guys are getting married, and I couldn't be more thrilled.
but as her older brother, I have to tell you this:
if you ever hurt my little sister...
...if you ever cause her any unappiness of any kind...
...I will hunt you down...
...and kick your ass.
what? I'm serious.
dude! Stop it! I'm not kidding. - I hear what you're saying...
...and thanks for the warning.
no problem.
are we friends again?
Yeah.
you won't believe what Monica's brother just said to me!

what you doing, Mon?
I'm listing things that could go wrong at the wedding.
so I can be prepared.
what are they? - So far, the dresses won't get picked up...
...my veil gets lost or I don't have something blue.
I'm responsible for all those.
I had to go with the odds.
remember that audition I had a while ago and I didn't get the part?
the commercial? - That play?
that other play?
the movie? - Yes!
the one about the dog who flies planes?
no. But, man, that one hurt.
this is the one about WWI soldiers. - Oh, yeah.
back then we called it "The Great War.
it really was.
the guy they wanted backed out! I start shooting today!
Congratulations!
today's the rehearsal dinner. - I'll be done by then.
Oh. Then way to go, you big movie star!
see you. I'm off to fight the Nazis.
wait, Joey. We fought the Nazis in WWll, not WWI.
who was in WWI?
go ahead.
you're gonna be late! Go! Go!
who did we fight in WWI?
Mexico? - Yes. Very good.
Hey, Joey. We're ready. - Yeah, me too.
Richard, we're ready for you.
Joey Tribbiani, this is Richard Crosby. He's playing Vincent.
I'm acting with you? - Nice to meet you.
I can't believe this. This is incredible. You just won an Oscar.
no, I didn't.
I think you did.
I think I lost, three times.
cookie? Would you...? - No.
we're about an hour away from getting the scene lit.
can you guys run it a couple times? - Yeah, sure.
all right. Let's do it.
and... Action!
we have to find the platoon! - Forget it, the platoon is gone!
what? - The platoors dead! Face facts, Tony!
what'll we do? We have no reinforcements or food.
there's food in the basement. Potatoes and some pasta.
hang on. Joey, you keep touching your face.
something wrong?
no. No.
I thought it might be a cool character thing.
he's a face toucher.
I don't think so.
let's take it back to Richard's last lines. Action!
we may not have weapons, but we still have food.
potatoes, pasta...
...and a few tins of tuna!
honey, we gotta go!
here's a question you never want to ask:
can my dad borrow one of your pearl necklaces?
did he say what kind of neckline he's wearing?
no.
I just met him once, but I'm guessing...
...plunging?
he is more of a if-you've-got-it- flaunt-it kind of father.
let me see if Rachel has anything.
Yes, include more people in this.
do you realize that at this time tomorrow we're gonna be getting married?
I have a date tomorrow night.
I can't believe we made it. - Don't sound so surprised.
I'm sorry, but...
nothing. - What?
well, honestly? Ever since we got engaged...
...l've been waiting for something to flip you out.
honestly? Me too.
Really? - Yeah.
I think that something will come up and I'll go all...
well, Chandler.
but nothing has. - I'm so glad.
thank you for staying so calm during this.
it's made me stay calm.
I could've been worse.
I'll be right there.
if you're calling before Saturday, you've reached Monica and Chandler.
but if you're calling after Saturday, you've reached Mr. And Mrs. Bing.
please leave a message for... the Bings!
Hey, Maureen! Hi!
this is my cousin, Maureen. - We're the Bings.
Hi! You guys look so beautiful.
Mr. And Mrs. Bing!
Monica.
so you know, I had my "older brother" talk with Chandler.
what is that?
I told him that if he ever hurt you...
...I would hunt him down and kick his ass.
what is the matter with everybody? I'm serious.
I would kick his ass!
Ross, please, my makeup!
Chandler. - Mom.
thanks for wearing... something.
this is so exciting! I thought we screwed you up too much for this.
just think, soon there will be lots of little Bings.
I can't believe I'm going back to work to get spit on again.
you're lucky. At least the people that spit on you are famous.
who spits on you? - I don't want to talk about work.
Mrs. Bing? These are my parents, Judy and Jack Geller.
it's lovely to meet you. - Are you his mother or father?
Jack!
what? I've never seen one before.
dad, there's Ross. Go talk to him.
I wasn't even able to act like I'm okay with it.
Hello, all.
hi... Dad.
Hi, Mr. Bing.
Nora. - Charles.
it's so great to see you both here. - Yes.
although we may be seeing too much of some people.
Arert you a little old to wear a dress like that?
don't you have a little too much penis to wear a dress like that?
Oh, my God.
of course you can kick his ass, son.
you could kick anyone's ass you want to.
Thanks, you guys.
Rach, Rach? - Yeah?
talk to Chandler's dad and keep him away from Chandler's mom.
but I don't know what he looks like. - He's the man in the black dress.
Hi! I'm Rachel, a friend of Monica and Chandler's.
I'm Amanda. - Oh, I get it.
a man, duh!
could I have your attention?
I'm Ross Geller. - Dr. Ross Geller.
dad, please. As I was saying...
...l'm Dr. Ross Geller.
and I'm the best man.
and I have to say, I'm a little surprised we're all here today.
for those of you who don't know Chandler...
...he's not the biggest fan of relationships.
in fact, I think before he met Monica...
...the only real relationship he had was with a girl named Molly.
and he would've married her, only she couldn't control her bladder.
it was his dog. Did I say it was his dog?
any... Anyway...
this marriage is doubly special for me...
...because not only is the groom my best friend...
...but the bride is my little sister.
she's the greatest sister a guy could ask for.
please join me in raising a glass to the couple we're here to celebrate.
to the Bings. - To the Bings!
how cool is it that the next time you see Chandler you'll be walking down the aisle?
I can't believe that after tomorrow it's all gonna be over.
honey, it's not gonna be over. You're gonna be married to Chandler.
maybe I can wear the dress for Halloween!
I'm gonna steam my dress.
who will make sure nothing happens to it?
I'll do it. - Who wants it? Anybody?
I said, I'll do it. - Nobody?
all right, I'll do it myself. - I'm not gonna screw it up.
you're right. I'm sorry. You were a big help tonight.
thanks for helping my grandmother get to the hotel safely.
of course! That's what I'm here for. - Okay. Sorry.
what grandmother?
where have you been? - Taking my parents to the hotel.
going back to work? - Yeah.
nice shades. - Thanks.
I figure if I wear these in my scenes, I won't get spit in my eyes.
and, if I remember correctly, Ray-Ban was the official sponsor of WWI.
great! All right!
I'll see you later. - All right.
Where's Chandler? - I think he's in Rachel's room.
Chandler?
is Monica here? - She's steaming her dress. Why?
I think Chandler's gone. - What?
he left that. - "Tell Monica I'm sorry.
Oh, my God.
what's up?
tell Monica I'm sorry.
tell her yourself.
Oh, my God. Chandler just left, though?
maybe it's not what we think. Maybe it's:
tell Monica I'm sorry I drank the last of the milk.
or "Tell Monica I'm sorry I used her tweezers to pluck my nose hair.
he does that. I've seen him.
or maybe he was writing to tell her that he's changed his name:
tell Monica I'm Sorry.
it means he freaked out and left! - Don't be so negative!
good God, isn't it possible that "Sorry" is sitting in there right now?
Phoebe, I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?
I'm gonna have to go find him and bring him back.
you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?
but if you don't find him and bring him back...
...I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!
I will find him.
well, the dress is done.
what?
we're just so happy for you.
that's so sweet!
can we just take a minute and talk about the man I'm gonna marry tomorrow.
I mean, how lucky am I?
that's a good question.
I just hope that someday you guys find someone like Chandler.
I hope we find someone exactly like Chandler and soon.
Joey? Can you go through these lines with me?
Oh, man, they just re-did my makeup.
just the last two pages. - All right.
I found the picture!
picture? What picture?
the picture of my wife I found in your pack.
could you lower the script? - I don't want to.
I need to see your face so I can play off your reaction.
okay, look.
I know you're great and play all those Shakespeare guys...
...but you're spitting all over me, man.
of course I am! - You know you've been spitting?
that's what real actors do.
enunciation is the mark of a good actor.
and when you enunciate, you spit!
didn't know that.
Thanks. Okay, check it out.
picture? What picture?
Gunther, have you seen Chandler? - No, I haven't seen him.
damn. - He's getting married tomorrow, right?
Yes. Don't worry. Everything's fine.
we'll see you tomorrow at the wedding. - I wasn't invited.
then we'll see you the day after tomorrow.
mom? Dad?
what are you doing here?
we thought we'd see what the fuss is all about.
I see why the girls like coming here. - Why?
the sexy blond behind the counter.
Gunther? - She just added him to her list.
what? Your list? - Of people we're allowed to sleep...
I know what the list is.
come on, sit down. Have a cup of joe.
dad, I can't. I'm sorry.
if you see Chandler, tell him I'm looking for him.
and if you see Rita Moreno, let her know I'm looking for her.
action!
I found the picture!
what picture?
the picture of my wife, in your pack!
you went through my personal property?
why do you have a picture of Paulette in your pack?
because, Vincent, we were lovers for two years!
cut! Wonderful!
great scene!
you were awesome. In that last speech, you soaked me.
tomorrow's call sheet. - I'm not working tomorrow.
you are now. - No, you gotta get me out of it.
I have plans. Important plans!
Ross said still no word from Chandler. - Oh, man.
but they found the grandmother wandering down 5th Avenue.
okay, well, there's one down.
I'm getting married today!
I cracked a rib, but I don't care. Today's my wedding!
my day is finally here!
she might not even notice he's gone.
I'm gonna start getting ready!
we can't let her start getting ready. This is too awful!
but she'll be in the gown and then he won't show up...
...then she'll have to take off the gown...
stop it. You can't do this here.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
it's just so sad.
pull it together. She can't see you like this.
she'll know something's wrong. - I know. I know. Oh, God!
there's no tissue.
can you grab me some toilet paper?
Oh, that's gone too. This is Monica's bathroom, right?
I found one. - Okay.
here you go. - Thank you.
Oh, God.
can I have another one?
sure.
do you need some floss?
I can't imagine what will happen if he doesn't show up.
here's a whole bunch.
she'll be at the wedding waiting...
...and people will be whispering, "Oh, that poor girl.
then she'll have to come back here and live alone.
Oh, my God. - What?
there was a pregnancy test in the garbage. And it's positive.
Monica's pregnant.
so I guess she won't be totally alone.
Oh, my God!
I know. Monica's gonna have a baby!
can this count as her "something new"?
Oh, my God.
do you think this is why Chandler took off?
she had to have just taken that test. I took out the trash last night.
it's turning into the worst wedding ever.
the bride's pregnant, the groom's missing and I'm still holding this.
Phoebe, we cannot tell anyone about this.
right. Yeah. - Okay?
Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she uses?
no. Why?
just for the future. This is hardly a commercial for it.
anything?
no. I talked to Joey on the set. He hasn't heard from him.
I talked to Chandler's parents again.
you said he was missing?
no. I made it seem like I called to chat.
pretty sure they both think I'm interested in them.
we've got to tell her he's gone. - No, we can't.
she'll start getting ready soon.
can't you stall her? I'll go back to the places I went last night.
how much time?
how long before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
one hour. - Give me two.
then why do you ask?
wish me luck. - I'm going with you.
Why?
you're tired. You looked all night. And, clearly, you suck at this.
I have documented night blindness.
no, you don't!
okay. But I don't suck!
see you later.
do you know how you're gonna stall her?
because she is insane about her schedule today.
I'll figure something out. - Okay, good luck.
I thought we'd start with my makeup and then do my hair.
okay. But before you do that, I need you to talk to me.
about what?
I'm never gonna get married!
you will. The right guy's just around the corner.
okay, are we done with that?
no, I'm serious.
maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.
any woman would be lucky to have you.
maybe I'd feel better if I slept with Joey.
Rachel? Are you okay?
excuse me, Aaron? I have a little problem with the schedule.
I wasn't supposed to work today. I have a wedding that I have to be at.
it's my best friend's and I'm officiating...
...so I really can't work past 4.
you've gotta stay until the end. We can't stop filming just for you.
it's not like it's your wedding.
it is my wedding.
did I not make that clear?
you said your best friend is getting married.
Yeah, to me.
Yeah, I'm marrying my best friend. Isn't that beautiful?
but you said you were officiating. - Yeah.
your own wedding? - Happens more than you think.
I'm sorry, Joey. It's still no.
I'm having surgery.
what?
I made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn't want you to worry.
but I'm having surgery today.
what kind of surgery?
transplant.
but you're supposed to work on Monday.
hair transplant.
but you're not bald.
it's not on my head.
there's nothing I can do. You'll probably be out by 4 anyway.
we've just got one short scene, it's just you and Richard and he's a pro.
you'll be fine.
morning, Richard.
Hey, you're here! Great! Let's go, buddy!
we got a scene to shoot!
I'm wearing two belts.
are you drunk? - No.
Yes, you are!
all right.
we are never gonna find him. He's one guy in a huge city.
Oh, my God. Is that him?
that is an old Chinese woman.
he could be in disguise, you know.
you know what? You're right. You're absolutely right.
wait a minute.
Chandler!
now you're thinking.
maybe we're just approaching this all wrong.
if you're Chandler and you want to hide...
...where is the last place on Earth people would think you'd go?
so this is your office.
how'd you guys find me? I knew I should've hid at the gym.
what the hell are you doing? - Panicking.
and using the Internet to try to prove that I'm related to Monica.
how is she? - She doesn't know you're gone.
and she doesn't have to know. Come on, we're going home.
I can't do that. - Why not?
because if I go home, we're gonna become the Bings.
I can't be the Bings.
what's wrong with it?
the Bings have horrible marriages.
they yell, they fight...
...and they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games.
have you ever put on a black dress and asked me up to your hotel room?
no. - Then you are neither of your parents.
it's not just their marriage. Look at yours. Look at everybody's.
only Paul Newman can make marriage work.
and I've met me. I am no Paul Newman.
I don't race cars or make popcorn. None of my proceeds go to charity.
but look, Chandler...
...right now no one has a lower opinion of you than I do.
but I totally believe you can do this.
I want to. I love her so much, but I'm afraid...
this is too huge.
you're right. It is huge.
so why don't we take it just a little bit at a time.
forget getting married for a sec. Just forget about it.
can you just come home and take a shower?
well, yeah. But then...
we're just gonna go home and take a shower.
that's not scary, right?
depends on what you mean by "we.
all right! - There he is!
good old Chandler with the homophobic jokes.
so, what do you say?
I'll shower, but I won't promise anything.
okay, that's all we're talking about. Okay? Come on, let's go home.
who's Mike Smith?
I was sure this was my office.
the nights are the hardest.
but then the day comes...
...and that's every bit as hard as the night.
then the night comes again... - The days and nights are hard, I get it!
I have to start getting ready. I'm getting married today.
I know. At dusk.
that's such a hard time for me.
I'm gonna put my makeup on. We have to be at the hotel in an hour.
wait! - What?
let's go to lunch!
I can't go to lunch!
right.
Oh, good God, I've fallen down.
what's going on?
all right, honey, listen.
when I tell you what I'm about to tell you, I need you to remember...
...that we are all here for you and that we love you.
okay, you're really freaking me out.
we can't find Chandler's vest.
we can't find Chandler's vest.
how can that be? Wait, are you serious?
found the vest.
we'll have to keep an eye on it, make sure we don't lose it again.
okay, don't scare me like that, okay?
for a minute, I was like, "Oh, my God! The worst has happened!
I would sooner die in this hellhole than see her back with you!
that can be arranged.
let's reset. - What?! He got me!
let's take it from there.
are you a little off today? It's going terribly slowly.
look, my best friends are getting married in, like, an hour, okay?
and I'm the minister. Please, can you pull it together?
of course. I'm sorry. I'd hate you to miss anything like that on account of me.
I can do this. - Thank you. Thank you.
still rolling. And, action.
I would sooner die in this hellhole than see her back with you!
that can be arranged!
slippery little bugger!
so you two were married, huh?
what happened, you just drift apart?
do you remember our wedding day?
did you know I slept with the best man?
Yes, he told me.
at least I think that was what he said.
it was difficult to understand with his legs wrapped around my head.
here comes the bride.
Oh, my God, Monica!
I want to wear this every day.
you look so beautiful.
I'm so happy for me.
Hello? - Did Chandler show up yet?
we got him back. Everything's fine. - Damn it!
where are you? - I'm still on the set.
the wedding is in less than an hour.
I know. I'm sorry. The guy's drunk. They won't let me go until we get this.
Oh, my God. I'm gonna have to find another minister.
no, I'm the minister!
look, put them both on the phone, I'll marry them right now.
Joey, I have to go.
don't hang up on me! I'll marry you and me right now! I have the power!
there you go! You put on a tuxedo!
that wasrt scary, was it?
no.
I'm telling you, just a little bit at a time.
what's the next little bit?
getting married.
you can do that too. Just like you've done everything else.
Yeah, you're right. I can do that.
excuse me for a minute. - Where you going?
I'm not gonna run away again. I just want some fresh air.
okay. - Okay.
Oh, fresh air!
cover for me. - Maybe you're overreacting. You do that.
we gotta do something.
Joey won't make it, so I'll look around the hotel for other weddings.
don't tell them Monica's pregnant, because they frown on that.
okay.
Anastassakis Papasifakis wedding. Excellent.
Congratulations.
mazel tov.
Hi! Oh, great hat.
I need you to perform another wedding. Can you do that?
I don't know. Are they Greek Orthodox?
Yeah. Yeah.
they're my friends, Monica Stephanopolis.
and Chandler Acidophilus.
Hi. Hi.
Hi.
has anyone seen Chandler?
I thought he was with you. - He was with me.
we're playing a little game. Hide-and-seek.
you can't ask us, son. That's cheating.
you're right. Thanks for keeping me honest, Dad.
he better not come here. He can't see the bride in her wedding dress.
as I recall, when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.
that was after the wedding. It's not bad luck then.
honey, it isn't good luck.
Oh, my God! Monica.
I know!
how's Chandler doing? - Great.
he's doing great. Don't you worry about Chandler.
are you okay?
well, you're sweating.
out of happiness for you and Chandler.
these are beads of joy.
that's sweet.
don't touch me.
Phoebe, can I see you for a second? - Yeah.
what's going on? - Chandler's gone again.
why would you play hide-and-seek with someone you know is a flight risk?
aaron, you gotta let me go. The guy's hammered.
I'm sorry. As long as he's here and conscious, we're still shooting.
you wouldn't happen to have a very big fork?
so I just talked to the director.
that's it. We're done for the day.
we finished the scene?
you were wonderful. - As were you.
so I got your car. It's right outside.
Why? Are we done for the day?
that's what you told me.
thank you. You're welcome.
no, we gotta go. Come on. Here we go.
is that my ass?
there he is! - What?
you're not getting away this time, mister!
unless you want that ass-kicking we talked about!
Ross!
I'm serious! You're not walking out on my sister!
that's right. I'm not.
then where have you been? - I know about Monica.
you know? - What?
I heard you and Rachel talking.
what? Talking about what? - You don't know?
if somebody doesn't tell me what's going on right now...
what, you'll "hi-yah"?
Monica's pregnant.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. And you're not freaking out?
I was. Then I went to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes.
cigarettes? - Big picture, please!
so when I was in the gift shop, that's when I saw this.
and I thought, "Anything that can fit into this can't be scary.
you obviously didn't see Chucky III.
but come on, look at how cute and small this is.
so I got it to give Monica so she'd know I was okay.
dude.
way to go, son. I knew you'd find him.
our little boy is getting married.
look at you, so handsome.
you look beautiful, Mom.
you look beautiful too, Dad.
I love you both.
I'm so glad you're here.
are you Chandler?
are you Joey?
this is nice. - What?
I've never walked down the aisle knowing it can't end in divorce.
I wish your grandmother had lived to see this.
she's right there. - Not that old crone. My mother.
congratulations, darling.
we love you, sweetheart.
you look beautiful.
is this new? - Not now.
who's this? - I'm Father Karabasos.
he's Greek Orthodox.
as are you.
let us begin.
dearly beloved...
that's my line!
I can take it from here. Thanks.
dearly beloved, I'm sorry I'm a little late.
you may be confused by this now...
...but you won't be Memorial Day weekend, 2002.
let's get started before the groom takes off again.
we are gathered here today to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony.
I've known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I cannot imagine...
...Two people more perfect for each other.
and now, as I've left my notes in my dressing room...
...we shall proceed to the vows. Monica?
he took off? - Go on. Go on.
Chandler, for so long...
...I wondered if I would ever find my prince.
my soul mate.
then three years ago, at another wedding...
...I turned to a friend for comfort.
and instead I found everything that I'd ever been looking for my whole life.
and now...
...Here we are...
...with our future before us.
and I only want to spend it with you.
my prince.
my soul mate.
my friend.
unless you don't want to.
you go.
Chandler?
no, that's okay.
I thought this would be the most difficult thing I ever had to do.
but when I saw you walking down that aisle, I realized it's simple.
I love you.
any surprises that come our way, it's okay, because I will always love you.
you are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with.
you want to know if I'm sure?
you may now kiss the bride.
I guess by the powers vested in me by the state of New York...
...and the Internet guys...
...I now pronounce you husband and wife.
Oh, wait. Do you take each other?
I do. - I do.
Yeah, you do!
rings.
Oh, crap. Okay.
let's do the rings.
we good? Yeah? Good?
once again...
...I pronounce you husband and wife.
now kiss her again.
I love you.
and I know about the baby.
what baby? - Our baby.
we have a baby?
Phoebe found your pregnancy test.
I didn't take a pregnancy test.
then who did?
look at them.
and they're gonna have a baby.
Mr. Bauer, you are ordered to turn the aircraft around and return to CTU.
Jack's descending.
air Force choppers are in pursuit.
we've lost him.
if Jack gets this evidence and exposes the Russians, the agreement is over.
the peace agreement may not be the only casualty.
you covered up the Russians' involvement.
that's grounds for impeachment.
there's still a chance that CTU will find Jack.
even if they do, the evidence is still out there.
eventually, it will surface.
you need to control the evidence by keeping Walsh off the grid.
classify her as an enemy combatant and incarcerate her in a private facility.
I've authorized a private interrogation team to acquire the evidence.
once we have it, she'll be irrelevant.
I can't be a part of this any longer.
cite my health as the reason for my resignation.
the president's ordered your transfer to an off-site facility.
what do you mean off-site facility?
it's a secure location.
just do what he says, Dana.
Chloe, don't let them do this.
let's go. - Please. They're gonna kill me.
Chloe! Chloe, please!
you told Bauer you have evidence.
I have got nothing to tell you. There is no evidence.
the sooner you tell me, the easier it'll go.
No!
mobilizing a sting operation to be led by Agent Ortiz.
the target is Jack Bauer.
put your weapons down!
I can't do that, Jack!
put your weapons down now!
I need you to help me gain access to Dana Walsh.
I am giving you an opportunity to make this right, to make the people that are responsible for everything that happened today accountable.
Chloe said she's in a safe house a few miles from here.
all right, now it's imperative that they think I took you hostage.
get up!
and though fate has prevented my husband from being here today at the culmination of his life's work,
I know that he is watching us now, looking down and guiding us as we take the last steps towards this historic agreement.
finally, I would like to express my gratitude to President Taylor...
whose integrity and moral courage have been unshakable during the long course of these negotiations.
she is someone on whom my husband built an absolute trust.
and I want to make it clear that her efforts and the efforts of the United States government to rescue him were nothing short of heroic.
my husband wasn't perfect.
none of us is.
but he carried a perfect idea in his heart: That peace is possible.
on this, the last day of his life, may the world come together and prove that he was right.
what a magnificent woman.
okay. - Who was that on the phone?
Bledsoe.
it's not the best of news, sir.
Dana Walsh isn't being as cooperative as he'd hoped.
well, what does he expect? She's a trained enemy agent;
she's not gonna to break at the drop of a hat.
look, I told President Taylor what might be necessary, and she signed off on it.
Bledsoe's a professional, sir.
I'm confident he'll come through for us.
he better.
sir, there was one more thing.
bledsoe wanted confirmation.
about what?
how to deal with Ms. Walsh, post interrogation.
I thought we settled that matter. - We did.
so why's he asking?
just to double check we're still committed to the same outcome.
and what did you tell him?
we're still committed to the same outcome.
not that I have any idea what you're talking about.
you understand?
perfectly, sir.
let her up.
I'll give you a little tip. Take short, shallow breaths.
you'll recover faster.
and then we won't have so much downtime between sessions.
it's up to you, you know.
you can stop this whenever you want.
all you have to do is tell me what I want to know.
I told you that I was making it up. There is no evidence.
you told Jack Bauer you had proof that elements in the Russian government were behind the assassination of President Hassan.
I was bluffing.
stalling for time. There isn't any proof.
don't lie to me. - I'm not lying.
we begin again in ten seconds.
seven, six... - Bring it on, you son of a bitch.
put her down.
Where's the evidence?
go to hell. - Gag her.
okay. They got two sentries out in front in a black sedan, one lookout on the roof, most likely another across the street, but I couldn't see him.
we can access the back of the building through that alley.
so, once we get Dana, what then?
as painful as it is, we got to cut a deal in exchange for the evidence.
you mean let her go. - Cole, we both lost friends today.
and Dana had a hand in that, but only a hand.
if we can get the people in charge, the people that gave the orders, it'll be worth it.
it's Chloe.
answer it. Otherwise, she'll know something's wrong.
if she doesn't already.
hello. - Cole, what's your ETA?
ten minutes. FDR Drive was a mess. We're coming up First Ave instead.
is Jack with you?
Yeah, I got him. He's locked down in the back.
I'm glad we found him before he got hurt. Or worse.
Yeah.
I've known Jack for a long time, and I've never seen him like this.
he threatened me; he's never done that before.
you did the right thing, Chloe.
thanks for saying that.
I'll talk to you when you get here. - Yeah.
we're good. She has no idea.
don't be too hard on her, Jack.
she was only doing what she thought was best for you.
I know.
almost forgot.
you're gonna need these.
I'm sorry, I just couldn't take the chance.
son of a bitch.
Yeah, I know.
you ready? - Yeah.
let's go.
keep your head down.
go.
that's right, four hours prior to the signing ceremony, all available field units will be redeployed to the U. N.
mobile HQ is being set up on the first floor, adjacent to the high commissioner's offices.
hold on a second; I got O'Brian on the other line.
yeah?
who's the psych officer on duty?
that would be Melissa Anderson.
she did all the grief counseling last night.
make sure she's the first person Jack sees when he gets here. I want a complete eval.
you really think that's necessary? - I wouldn't have ordered it if I didn't.
I'll let her know.
I got a visual. They got one man on the roof.
okay. Wait till I get into position, then you draw them out.
all units, this is Command.
please report.
command, this is unit four. Roof's clear.
all units, copy that.
stay alert.
we're clear.
let's go.
you make that cover. I'll draw him out.
command, I'm taking sniper fire on the roof.
the building across the street. I need backup now.
unit four, stand by. I'm sending backup now.
copy that. Hurry!
all units to the roof.
unit four is reporting sniper fire.
repeat: all units to the roof. Unit four is under sniper fire.
go. Go.
command, we're on the roof.
it's quiet; there's no sign of Mullins.
come again?
all's quiet, but we can locate Unit four.
unit four, come in, please.
Where's Dana Walsh?
where is she?
command, Mullins is down, sir.
last chance.
repeat: Mullins is down.
first room on the left. - Thank you.
command, do you copy?
command, come in.
we're clear.
the first room on the left, I've got it.
put your gun down now!
no, you drop your weapon or I'll put a bullet in her brain!
I don't want to kill you, but I will if I have to.
put your gun down! - You won't take the shot.
it's too risky. I'll kill her before...
Cole, untie her.
Cole, now!
take her out the back. We're gonna get company soon.
Hurry!
Cole, have you got her?!
almost!
I got her!
move! Move!
stay covered.
Cole, take the stairs now!
Jack! Get going! I'll be right behind you!
in a second. Just finishing rescanning the field reports.
you need to hear this, Chloe.
agent Beck just checked in from the laundry.
he said he's been locked down for the past half hour, and only just now managed to free himself.
what? - Apparently, Jack didn't fall for the trap.
instead, he reversed the entire squad and took Cole hostage.
I just talked to Cole.
Beck says Jack had him at gunpoint.
Devin, pull up the satellite on the lower East Side. Address: 14633 12th Street.
Why? - It's where the private contractors are holding Dana.
it's where Jack's on his way to now.
what is going on, Chloe?
he's been two steps ahead of me the whole time.
he probably knew what I was gonna do before I did.
Hello, everybody! Can I have your attention, please?
Jack Bauer's no longer in custody of CTU.
agent Cole Ortiz is with him, most likely as a hostage.
our priority is to find them now.
satellite's online, Ms. O'Brian.
put it up.
we're too late. Put the APB back out on Jack, all agencies.
get me the White House.
where are we going?
you tell me.
you said you had a video file implicating people inside the Russian government who are responsible for Renee's murder.
I want that file.
and I said I'd give it to you in exchange for immunity.
that deal's off the table.
the president decided the peace agreement's more important than the truth.
as far as she's concerned, that file can never see the light of day.
but I still want it.
what's the new deal? - You give us the file, we let you go.
go where, Riker's Island?
Dana, you're a small fish in all of this. I'm going after the people who gave the orders.
you give me the evidence, we'll let you go. I give you my word.
your word?
I'm sorry. I don't believe you, Jack.
fine.
you think this is a joke?
we'll do it another way.
get out. Get out!
tell me where that file is-- now!
that file's the only thing keeping me alive!
no, right now I'm the only thing keeping you alive.
I'm gonna count backwards from three, and then I'm gonna kill you.
you're really not gonna let him shoot me in cold blood, are you, Cole?
back off! One!
in a safety-deposit box!
where? - First Unity Savings.
Cole knows. We have a joint account there.
but the box is in my name, which means I'm the only one who can access it.
Where's the bank? - Lexington, off East 59th.
I had nothing to do with Renee's death, Jack.
I didn't even know she was a target. - Put her in the car.
I was in a CTU holding cell! - Put her back in the car!
damn it!
you see what's happening here, don't you? He's using you.
using me? You're using me.
what do you think he's gonna do once I give him that file?
he's gonna give the evidence to the press and expose everyone responsible.
is that what you think?'Cause I doubt that's what Jack thinks.
he's gonna assemble the evidence, make a list of the guilty, and then he's gonna execute them one by one, starting with me.
this isn't about the truth, Cole. It's about revenge! Cole!
look, I can't do this!
she's just trying to get inside your head.
I know that, damn it!
you got something you want to say to me, you better say it now.
were you gonna pull that trigger?
I need her to think I would.
Yeah, okay.
Mrs. Hassan, please allow me to offer my condolences for your loss.
your husband was a great man. - Thank you.
how has news of his death been received back in the Islamic Republic?
and do people there generally support your decision to take his place as head of state?
I'm confident that most of my country is behind me.
those who aren't, probably never supported my husband's policies in the first place.
and what are your plans after the treaty is signed?
right now, I'm concentrating all my efforts on the pursuit of finishing what my husband started with this agreement.
but I want to return to Kamistan.
is this true? - I'm afraid so, ma'am.
the details are sketchy, but as of 15 minutes ago,
Jack Bauer stormed the safe house, overwhelmed security and took Dana Walsh.
do we have any idea where they are?
a hard target search is under way.
your note also mentioned Charles Logan.
Yes, ma'am. He's been calling and demanding to speak to you.
he insisted that I interrupt the press conference.
all you'll have to do is hit redial.
thank you, Tim. Excuse me. - Yes, ma'am.
...the body be ritually washed and draped...
Hello?
how in God's name could this have happened?!
madam President, the important thing is not to panic.
you assured me that Dana Walsh would be more secure in the hands of your private contractors.
we didn't move her out of CTU solely for security reasons, as I'm sure you remember.
do you have me on speaker, Charles?
pick up the damn phone.
forgive me, I wasn't thinking.
apparently, neither was I.
it's a little late for buyer's remorse, Madam President, especially because I was calling with a solution to our current problem.
Bauer may have Walsh, but he can't have the evidence yet.
we've still got a chance to stop him. - How?
by putting somebody inside CTU, someone whose loyalties aren't split, who won't hesitate to see the mission through no matter what the cost.
I've already replaced one director. I can't replace another.
no, not a new director. Just someone to supervise the manhunt for Bauer.
I'm recommending Jason Pillar.
your aide?
he's Bureau-trained, Madam President.
he was second in command at DIA during the Daniels' Administration and he made a name for himself in Afghanistan, chasing high-value targets behind enemy lines.
of course if you have a better idea, I'll gladly take a step back.
madam President. - Just a second.
what is it, Susan? - Mrs. Hassan is finishing up.
I'm on my way.
look, I'll tell Tim Woods that I support you making an operational change.
but that's it, Charles-- no more excuses.
thank you, Madame President. And allow me to say that...
no, I understand completely.
and I appreciate your confidence in Jason.
how soon can you leave for CTU?
immediately. - Good.
I'll handle the arrangements on this end.
congratulations, Charles.
you have recast yourself as the great peacemaker.
I appreciate your help in getting me this far, Mikhail.
so tell me what I'm doing here?
I had hoped to have this conversation in private.
this is my attach?? Pavel Tokarev.
you can speak freely.
he is more than well acquainted with the situation.
well...
there's been an unforeseen problem.
apparently I'm not the only one who can prove that elements in your government conspired to undermine the peace process.
Meaning?
Dana Walsh, the mole you installed inside CTU, claims to have evidence to that effect.
not possible.
she was handled with complete deniability.
so you say.
but, no one in this room can take the chance that she's bluffing.
now... I tried to contain this.
I had Ms. Walsh detained and interrogated.
the problem is, Jack Bauer just broke her out.
apparently, he has a personal interest in exposing this evidence.
then you need to stop him.
surely President Taylor is motivated to do the same.
she is, to a point. But I know Bauer.
and I can promise you he will never let this go.
and I don't think the president is willing to do what is ultimately required.
so you expect me to kill Bauer for you?
we both know you have the covert assets here to do the job.
maybe I do-- but I don't have the resources to find him, track him.
CTU does.
and the man in charge of the search now reports to me.
how would this work?
this is a closed-channel phone.
it's impossible to intercept.
my man at CTU will use it to feed your people real-time information as to Bauer's whereabouts.
and they can put an end to this problem, once and for all.
we have to assume that CTU's been getting my face out there.
you're going to have to take her into the bank on your own.
I'll stand sentry in the lobby.
how well do you know the layout inside?
vault's in the back. Tellers are on one side of the room, loan officers are on the other.
one of them's an old buddy of mine from high school. He was helping us line up a mortgage.
okay, you keep her inside your strike zone.
if she sees an opportunity, she's going to take it. You trust her for nothing, you understand?
I'll be fine, Jack.
okay, let's go.
I know you hate me right now, but I don't really believe you want to see me executed.
save it.
we both saw how close he came to pulling the trigger back there.
that's just what he wanted you to think.
if that's what he told you, he's lying.
just like he's lying about what he's going to do with that file.
Jack wants to bring the people responsible for this to justice.
just like me. - Who do you think these people are, Cole?
they're Russian diplomats with full diplomatic immunity.
they'll be indicted by the World Court and hauled up in front of the Hague.
you really believe Jack Bauer wants to trust some toothless international tribunal to mete out justice to the people who killed Renee?
you're hurting me. - You'll live.
confirm all traffic camera feeds are being ported through us.
Up-res and route everything through facial recognition.
Parameter-matching on Jack, Cole, or Dana.
we don't have anywhere near the bandwidth to do that citywide.
then job the overflow to NSA.
where are we on setting up the search grid with NYPD?
in process. They're giving us all the personnel they can spare, But they're going on record that, unless we narrow down the search area, it's "needle in a haystack" time.
there's a Jason Pillar on his way to see you.
pillar? - Yeah.
tim Wood's office pre-cleared him.
send him up. - He's already on his way.
he wouldn't wait.
never heard of this guy. Who is he?
he was second in command at DIA under the Daniel's administration.
he's been working the private sector for years.
ms. O'Brian, Jason Pillar.
this is my associate Eden Linley.
okay.
so why are you here?
frankly, the White House is unhappy with the way the manhunt for Jack Bauer's been handled.
president Taylor's issued an executive order placing me in charge of the search from here on.
What?!
you'll retain your position as acting director for the time being with authority over all over CTU operations.
Arlo, give us a minute?
you got it.
this doesn't make any sense. - Excuse me?
why are you here? You have nothing to do with Homeland Security anymore.
ms. O'Brian, all you need to know is that I'm here under the president's orders.
well, you're wasting your time. We've done everything possible to find Jack.
if that were true, then the trap you set for Bauer would have worked.
it's not that simple.
instead, you were more concerned with making sure he didn't get hurt.
it's all in the hourlies. In fact, the last operational command you sent to Agent Ortiz was, "Remember, non-lethal force.
not exactly the appropriate sentiment when the president told you how important it was that Bauer be stopped.
the president doesn't want Jack to be hurt.
she knows what he'd done for this country-- and so do you.
what Bauer's doing will destroy the peace agreement.
and the president cannot let that happen.
it's time to take off the kid gloves.
we need all protocols and encryption keys transferred to us immediately.
as well as system overrides and administrative privileges.
understood?
ms. O'Brian?
Yeah, understood.
Re-code the all-agency bulletin on Bauer to "armed and dangerous" level eight.
and change the use of force guidelines to "unrestricted.
here we go.
just make yourselves comfortable. I'll be right back with your safety deposit box.
Thanks. - Thank you.
let's go.
something funny?
this.
you and me-- it's not the way that it was supposed to turn out.
I'm serious, Cole.
now that this is all over, you deserve to hear the truth.
it's a little late for the truth.
if you're even capable of it.
you don't have to believe me.
I was a kid.
a kid with five years of prison behind me and no future to speak of.
a guy came to see me-- a Russian.
said that he could give me a fresh start.
I had absolutely no idea what I was getting myself into.
you could have come clean anytime you wanted.
and go back to jail. Not a chance.
look, I know that it's not an excuse, but ever since I met you I have been trying to dig myself out of this mess that I'm in.
you're right-- I don't believe you.
it's why I made that video file, Cole.
I was going to use it as leverage to get the Russians to leave us alone.
us? - Yes.
there is no "us," Dana.
there never was.
it was a lie from the beginning.
that is not true.
just stop playing me. It's not going to work.
I am not playing you.
I loved you.
here we go-- 14-05.
I'll be outside.
thank you, Brian.
no.
you never give up, do you?
you guys all right?
911. What is your emergency?
I'm at First Unity Savings Bank on Lexington.
there's a guy by the front door.
I-I think I saw him on the news.
I think he has a gun.
Oh, my God.
he's looking in my direction.
Oh, God!
great. As quickly as you can.
the 911 comm center just confirmed the call.
Bauer was supposedly I. D.'d by someone at the First Unity Savings branch on Lexington.
supposedly? What do you mean supposedly?
it means all we have is the caller's word that she recognized Jack from the news coverage.
we don't have secondary confirmation.
then get it for me.
request access to the bank's video surveillance system.
I've already contacted them. I'm just trying to connect.
having trouble getting the CTU comm protocols to work.
you, what's your name?
Devon Rosenthal. - Help her.
don't look at O'Brian. I'm giving you the order. Just follow it.
all right, let's see what's going on.
all right, this is the... - Oh, good.
got it?
here we go.
full access to the bank's video surveillance system.
we got him.
call NYPD and make sure they realize the priority here.
and tell them I want to be looped in their operation in real time.
got it.
yes?
we found Bauer.
he's at a bank. First Unity Savings on Lexington.
how do you know?
a 911 call confirmed by video surveillance.
then the police are already on their way.
can't help that. But once they have Bauer, I'll find out where they're holding him.
you'll have to take him out while he's in custody.
I'll wait for your call.
brown jacket, freeze! Police! Get your hands up! Get your hands up now!
hands up!
on your knees. Get down on your knees.
put your hands behind your head.
interlock your fingers, thumbs out.
do not move.
we got him.
take it easy. You got no chance.
we got units coming in.
shut up! - You know who I am?
do you know who I am?! - Yes.
I don't want to kill your partner, but I will if I have to.
so here's what we're gonna do: Slowly, you're gonna put your gun down.
drop your weapon now!
kick it over to me.
I'm sorry.
call an ambulance. Call an ambulance now.
tell them two police officers are down.
don't you move!
slowly... turn around and head back to me.
now!
what happened to Cole?
did you kill him?
I could never do that.
Where's the evidence?
it's in my pocket.
show me.
Jack, we can make a deal.
show me!
I want you to slowly put it down on the floor.
tell me what I can do.
nothing. Nothing.
I'll be right back.
Oh, God...
you said you had video file implicating people inside the Russian government who were responsible for Renee's murder.
I want that file.
tell me where that file is, now! It's in a safety deposit box!
where?
first Unity Savings.
I had nothing to do with Renee's death, Jack.
no.
you never give up, do you?
Bauer may have Walsh, but he can't have the evidence yet.
we've still got a chance to stop him.
I'm not the only one who can prove that elements in your government conspired to undermine the peace process.
so you expect me to kill Bauer for you?
you have the covert assets here to do the job.
maybe I do.
but I don't have the resources to find him.
CTU does.
and the man in charge of the search now reports to me.
we got him.
once they have Bauer, I'll find out where they're holding him.
you'll have to take him out while he's in custody.
Freeze! Police!
do not move.
tell me what I can do.
nothing.
the following takes place between 12: 00 P. M. and 1: 00 P. M.
Mund, this is Captain Walleki.
I'm on scene. You got that guy from the bank yet?
just bringing him up, Captain.
right.
it's Cole Ortiz.
he says he's with CTU.
you were with this woman at the bank.
do you care to tell me who she is?
her name is Dana Walsh.
shot twice at close range - lot of powder residue around one of the entries, like an execution.
thank you, Mund. Get him to CTU, now.
the hit on Hassan is all arranged.
Bazhaev and his people are taking care of everything.
well, I'm pleased to hear it, but you could have just as easily called to tell me that.
I wanted to know if you've spoken to your superiors...
told them that I'm out after this goes down.
I told them what you wanted.
he feels the same as me:
we have too much invested in you to let you walk away.
you should be focused on getting the E. M.P. device into CTU, not on your boyfriend, Ortiz.
he's my fianc, and I told you to leave him out of this.
I warned you to stay away from him, but you didn't listen.
and now you think you have feelings for him?
you think you love him, going to marry him?
Yes.
I am.
and if you have a problem wrapping your brain around that fact, maybe I should talk to your boss in Moscow.
you talk to no one but me.
we're done here.
don't contact me again until Hassan is dead.
yeah? - Hey, it's me.
I sent you a DAT video file.
okay. I got it.
it's uploading right now.
okay, I need you to get me an I. D. of the man in the video.
also, I'm coming in hot, so whatever you have to do to protect your systems from getting flagged, do it now.
what about the woman? You need an I. D. on her?
she's dead. I'll see you in a few minutes.
all right.
Jack Bauer's last known location was First Unity Savings Bank on Lexington, where police responded to a 911 call, apparently from Dana Walsh.
she's dead now.
Bauer killed her.
who is known to be aiding and abetting Bauer is being brought here for questioning.
now, I need everybody not committed to the U. N. security task to devote their full attention to finding him.
I want all cameras routed through facial recognition and all phone calls monitored.
you don't have the bandwidth, you steal it from other tasks.
if you think you have a lead, you bring it to me immediately.
any questions? - Why did they go to the bank?
Dana said she had evidence of Russian involvement in Hassan's murder.
maybe that's where she was stashing it.
there's no evidence; the president dismissed this.
well, she went to the bank with Jack to get something.
Yeah, what she got was an explosive device that made possible her escape.
it was her plan all along.
look, Jack Bauer can't accept the fact that Dana Walsh was an enemy agent working solely with the I. R.K. opposition to Hassan's government.
his... grief over Renee Walker's murder is causing him to create this fantasy about a Russian conspiracy.
the simple truth is, he's lost it, and he's a danger to himself and the community.
so let's stop second-guessing the operation, and find him.
something is seriously wrong here.
pillar's ignoring the key questions, and the questions that he is answering, no one's asking.
what are you getting at?
I think Jack's right: this is a cover-up, and Pillar's involved.
that evidence was at the bank, and Jack has it.
you don't know that.
it's all speculation. It may be just like Pillar says.
until I know otherwise, I got my orders.
I'm clear. - Well, you weren't kidding.
you said you were coming in hot.
all the police scanners are talking about you.
was that the same woman in the video you sent me?
Yeah. Did you I. D. the man?
no. I'm not going to, either till you tell me what the hell is going on, Jack.
you saw the video.
Dana Walsh is a Russian operative.
she facilitated the assassination of President Hassan and the dirty bomb attack that would have wiped out the entire Upper West Side if we hadn't stopped it.
I don't want to know about what happened today, and I don't care;
I want to know why you're out there on your own and why everybody's after you.
because the president tried to lock me down.
Why? - Because I know she's trying to cover up the Russian's involvement in today's attack.
then why didn't you disappear? - Because I can't!
listen, I want to help you, Jack.
I really do.
I need you to be straight with me.
tell me exactly what's going on.
the Russians took something from me.
her name was Renee Walker.
they killed her inside my apartment.
and I need to make them pay.
all right.
actually, I did I. D. the guy.
there he is: Pavel Tokarev.
primary operative, Russian intelligence.
where is he?
I don't know exactly.
he's in the USA.
came in a month ago on a diplomatic visa.
diplomat. I tried to access the Russian database in the embassy.
he didn't show up in the consulate. He could be anywhere, Jack.
to keep everything quiet, they'd have to be a small unit, right?
Yeah.
I think I've got an idea. Get me a secure line.
Meredith. I didn't expect you'd still be here.
Abby can follow up on it for you.
I know. I just... I need to make sure it's right.
I know what he meant to you.
it shows in this piece you wrote.
what a great man he was.
you've done him justice.
I hope so.
miss Reed, there's a call for you on 3.
thank you.
let me know if there's anything you need.
Thanks, Gary.
this is Meredith Reed.
miss Reed.
who is this? - My name is Jack Bauer.
please don't say anything; just listen.
the people that you think are responsible for killing President Hassan were not working alone.
they were being funded and managed by people working inside the Russian government.
how do you know this?
I have proof of this: a video file that was made by a Russian agent working out of CTU.
she made it for her own protection.
it explains everything that happened in the last 24 hours.
have you contacted the authorities about any of this?
I can't. I'm being set up, just like you were yesterday.
I need to get this evidence to you.
there's a coffee stand on the third floor of Turner's Department Store.
do you think you get there in the next 20 minutes?
miss Reed yesterday I helped clear your name.
right now I need you to help clear mine.
please.
of course I'll help you.
I - I want to know the truth as much as you do.
thank you.
thank you.
take a seat.
Where's Bauer?
I don't know.
you're in some trouble here, Cole.
I assume you're aware of that.
luckily for you,
I'm in a position to make all that go away.
I reviewed your record.
you've had a exemplary career up to now.
you're Pillar.
that's right.
I've been asked by the president to oversee the effort to retrieve Jack Bauer.
madam President?
Yes.
so you're a part of the cover-up?
Oh, I see here you served in Fallujah.
I - I spent two tours in command of a marine unit in Baquba myself.
we're both soldiers.
so you understand, when the commander-in-chief deems a course of action necessary to the national good, it's not our place to question it.
the truth is:
we're on the same side. We both want what's best for our country.
Bauer doesn't care about that.
he didn't give a damn about what happened to you, just as long as it served his needs.
he used you.
so let's start over.
do you know where Jack Bauer is?
probably somewhere with the evidence you guys keep saying doesn't exist.
you really don't want to be playing with me.
what?
good news: we may have a line on Bauer.
we intercepted a call.
last chance.
you don't take it, there's nothing anyone can do for you.
take him to holding.
Arlo got a cell phone intercept report off of NSA's Echelon.
Keywords: Hassan, Russian government, Jack Bauer.
did Arlo hear any of the conversation?
no, not yet - all he's got so far are the data handles, but he's processing the voice matrix now.
are we sure it's Bauer?
no, not yet, but the other side of the call was a phone registered to Meredith Reed.
she's the reporter CTU arrested last night before the first attempt on Hassan's life.
rumor has it she was also his mistress.
if Bauer was going to reach out to someone with the evidence, she would be an excellent choice.
Arlo, stop what you're doing.
tag and lock the intercept download and send it directly to Eden's system.
she'll take it from there. - That's not necessary, sir.
I said I want Eden to handle it. Thanks, Arlo.
there's a video file that was made by a Russian agent working out of CTU.
she made it for her own protection.
it explains everything that happened in the last 24 hours.
have you contacted the authorities about any of this?
I can't. I'm being set up just like you were yesterday.
I need to get this evidence to you.
there's a coffee stand on the third floor of Turner's Department Store.
do you think you can get there in the next 20 minutes?
Yes, sir. We confirmed the voiceprint.
so take it to the press - that's his next move.
it appears to be.
Reed's connection to Hassan means she'd be highly motivated to help him.
and he hasn't shown her anything yet?
no, sir. Which still means that we, we don't know what the evidence actually is.
well, it will be in our hands soon enough.
this is a major opportunity to make everything go away, sir:
Bauer and the evidence.
I've already dispatched the Russian ops team to the location.
they'll be in position well before the meet.
you need to deal with local law enforcement, make sure Pavel has room to move.
Yes, we're deploying NYPD away from the site, but we'll still need your guys in and out as quickly as possible.
understood.
Jason, this is, this is a major break you've got, a major break.
thank you, sir.
we'll shut this down.
I want to stay on top of this personally, Mikhail.
so will you let me have Pavel's number?
can you make this room less public?
you wanted me for something?
Yeah, the call you intercepted-the one that Pillar hijacked
do you think it was from Jack?
I can't be sure.
the program hit on keywords Hassan, nuclear, Bauer, but all three have been in the news in the last few hours.
but the call was to Meredith Reed's cell phone.
she's a journalist with an interest in the Hassan story.
plenty of people could be calling her.
doesn't have to be Jack.
okay, then explain this.
cell intercept report comes in here.
two minutes later Pillar downloads the entire conversation into a segregated server surrounded by firewalls like I've never seen.
then what does he do?
call one, call two, call three.
who'd he call?
I don't know.
they're outside of CTU and they're all completely masked.
so the question is this: if the call was nothing, then why are they still hiding it?
if the call was Jack, then why haven't they dispatched CTU SWAT team?
why haven't they alerted NYPD?
Arlo, they're in on the cover-up.
look at them.
Why? Why would they want to do that?
because he knows too much.
he's gotten a hold of Dana's evidence, which proves the Russian involvement in Hassan's assassination.
they can't let him go public with that.
that's why I have to find him, and I need your help.
okay.
how do you want to do it?
I'm gonna talk to Cole.
he just spent the past two hours with Jack and Dana.
he must have some idea of what Jack's up to.
pillar's got Cole continuously monitored.
you can't get in there without being seen.
we'll create a loop and graft it into the security feed.
that's the other problem:
they added an extra layer of oversight to our system.
second I try to move beyond my security clearance,
I get an on-screen warning.
they're watching everything we're doing.
okay, fine.
we'll use this, create a mobile hot spot.
that way we can work off our own net without Pillar breathing down our necks.
got it.
setting up alternate network now.
we're up.
okay, I'm restricting access to you and me.
how long will it take you to make the loop?
I can only give you 90 seconds.
anything more than that, somebody will notice.
okay, text me when you're set up.
Fredericks, McDermott was injured in the E. M.P. blast, so I need you to collect the night shift time cards and take them to my office.
okay.
like now?
Yes, ma'am.
you're clear for 90 seconds
we put a loop in the security feed. I've only got 90 seconds, so I'm gonna get straight to the point.
I need to find Jack or else they're gonna kill him.
who's gonna kill him?
pillar and whoever is working with him.
you need to tell me where he is.
I got no idea.
you were at the bank with him; he must have said something.
Hey, what Jack says and what he does are two very different things.
he's trying to expose the cover-up.
he doesn't give a damn about any cover-up.
he's taking out anyone who was anywhere near Renee's death, starting with Dana.
she gave him the evidence and he killed her anyway.
she took the gun out of the safety deposit box.
she was probably shooting at him.
he shot her point-blank.
he executed her, just like she said he would.
there e no good guys here.
Jack, Pillar... they end up killing each other, maybe it's the best thing.
no, Jack's my friend.
if I can find him, I can talk him down.
these people are just going to kill him.
I need you to be on my side.
everybody wants me on their side.
who am I fighting for?
if we can get to him, we can expose the cover-up.
you just stay here and feel sorry for yourself.
I'm gonna go find him.
wait.
look, it's not much, but Jack's got to be working with someone.
who? - I don't know; I never saw him, but Jack showed up with state-of-the-art weapons and comms, so he's got to have a contact in the city.
you want to find Jack, you find his supplier.
Thanks.
Arlo. - You got out in time.
you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay.
listen, I know what Jack's doing.
pull up his files, get me the list of his known associates in the tri-state area, anyone he's worked with in the past.
okay.
in the next half hour, the man who has widely been acknowledged as the vital "third partner" in the peace process
russian President Yuri Suvarov
will touch down at JFK.
he'll be ferried into Manhattan by helicopter and then to the U. N.
Yes. - Pavel, update, please.
my team is in position.
any sign of Bauer?
not yet.
I need to know.
what about the woman?
the woman?
the journalist, her disposition.
ms. Reed is aiding and abetting a terrorist.
she's a serious threat to both our countries.
do what you have to.
I see from Ethan's notes that we still have not completely resolved the issue of site access for the inspection teams.
I believe it was resolved.
president Hassan agreed the inspectors would have right of passage over our entire country.
but he exempted schools. - Only primary schools.
omar didn't think ten-year-old children would be building nuclear missiles.
of course. I remember now.
I - I do apologize.
are you all right, Madam President?
it's been a long day.
I'm fine. Thank you.
madam President.
if you'll excuse me for a few minutes, there's someone I need to see.
of course.
where is he? - He's in the conference room, ma'am.
thank you for seeing me, Madam President.
I have good news. We've located Bauer.
he-he has the evidence, but Charles, you assured me that that wouldn't happen.
please, let me finish.
we know exactly where Bauer will be and when, and-and we have an operation underway to reacquire him even as we speak.
believe me, this is good news.
let me know as soon as it's resolved.
I need to get back to the negotiations.
just... There's just one thing, Madam President.
uh, we are three hours away from the signing of the treaty.
isn't it time for my role in the process to be officially recognized?
I was thinking some kind of, uh, announcement to the media, perhaps by your press secretary, or maybe even by you yourself, Madam President.
it was, you'll recall, our agreement that I would have a public face on this historic day.
I believe I've earned it.
I will talk to my press secretary.
she will make the announcement in time for the 1: 00 o'clock news.
thank you very much, Madam President.
we have contact.
target heading to the third floor escalator.
acknowledged.
I see her now.
we have eyes on Reed.
reed is confirmed.
units 2 and 3, Reed is approaching you.
confirm contact.
reed confirmed.
approaching the meeting place.
any sign of Bauer?
where is he? He should be here.
no sign.
Pavel, do you see Bauer?
not yet.
unit 1, report.
we have no visual of Bauer.
Jason, where are you going?
there he is. He's heading up towards...
damn it, I lost him.
all units, Bauer is on the third floor. Do you see him?
I do not have him. - What? He's there.
we see him. Get your eyes open, damn it!
I have not seen him.
got him.
Bauer is approaching the target from the southwest.
he's got a brown leather jacket and jeans.
there he is.
Pavel, he's in view.
you should have a clean line on him.
Pavel, if you have a shot, take it.
I've got him.
put it down.
everything's all clear up at the top, Jack. - Copy that
come with me. Do exactly what I say.
all units, target is in the open. Take him out.
I repeat: take him out.
you stay down here. You don't move. - Oh, okay.
don't move! - All right.
move! - Okay.
what the hell just happened?
he knew it was a trap.
don't let them out of your sight.
we lost him. - Just keep looking!
those people you shot - who were they?
russian operatives. You have any problems?
no.
let's go.
Jason. Tell me.
I'm afraid I have bad news, sir.
all of Pavel's team is dead, and Bauer has Pavel.
he was ahead of us from the get-go, sir.
he must have anticipated that we'd use Echelon, and he put out a series of keywords, knowing the listening stations would pick them up.
he played us, sir.
he knew we'd use off-book resources to deal with him.
he used that journalist to draw them out.
now, sir, I hardly need to tell you that the situation is grave.
Pavel knows everything.
he ran Walsh; he set up the Russian ops.
if Bauer gets Pavel to talk...
but at the moment, sir, you still have complete deniability.
president Taylor made all the decisions.
I think the time has come for you to distance yourself from this mess.
it's regrettable, sir, deeply so, but I believe it's what's best for you.
you...
20 minutes from now, the president's press secretary is going to make an announcement.
she will say I have become part of the president's team, and-and I have been indispensable in bringing this peace process to a successful close.
sir, may I say that that is a bad idea?
you need to distance yourself.
what? You keep using that phrase.
what-what does distance myself mean?
do I just slink away?
this isn't your fault, sir. There were circumstances we couldn't have anticipated.
namely Bauer.
well, then, we find Bauer, and we neutralize him.
we're public now,
we're committed.
and I have worked...
we...we have worked too hard just to throw this all away.
do you understand?
Yes, of course, sir, but Pavel...
no.
Pavel is a good soldier. He won't talk, whatever Bauer does to him.
I, uh...I put you at CTU, Jason, for a reason.
they have huge resources.
you have intelligence and tenacity.
you use those capabilities.
find Bauer.
Yes, sir.
I'll head down to the scene myself.
good.
keep me posted.
he wants to move forward.
does he understand what actually happened?
Yes, but he says we still have options.
I need to know you're with me on this.
Yes. Yes, I'm with you.
good. I'm heading out.
I'll clean up the scene, remove all trace of the Russians, and get on Bauer's trail.
I'll take CTU SWAT with me.
tell NYPD to put a two-block perimeter around the store.
no one goes in or out without my say-so.
what reason do I give them? - National security.
anyone gives you a hard time, invoke the White House.
any luck with Jack's associates?
no. Even discounting dead people, and people from foreign countries, it's still going to take hours.
I think I can narrow it down.
I just picked up a 911 call from Turner's in Midtown.
there was a oot-out, people killed.
I managed to get into the store's security system.
Oh, my God.
that's Jack.
they're trying to kill him.
Yeah, that part of the plan didn't go so well.
I tagged the footage 15 minutes before to 15 minutes after the shooting.
if we run facial recognition on the camera feeds...
we can match it to the database of Jack's associates, maybe find out who he's working with.
Thanks, Arlo.
no problem.
copy the camera footage to my screen.
I'll send you half the personnel files.
we're clear. Let's go.
let's go.
empty your pockets right now here.
take a seat.
we'll be safe here for a while.
Jack? We don't have much time.
take off your coat.
now!
those people you killed...
you were ready for them, weren't you?
you knew they were coming.
Yeah.
so you...you knew they'd be listening to our phone call.
isn't that right?
you used me to draw them out, right?
that's right.
I could have been killed back there!
you weren't.
now, pick it up.
I said pick it up!
what about the evidence you said you'd tell me?
was that a lie, too?
no.
the evidence is on this memory card.
when you see it, you'll know it's real.
take it.
my partner's gonna take you somewhere to show it to you.
I'm sorry things had to play out like this.
I didn't see another choice.
what are you gonna do?
put your hands behind your back. Now!
don't do this, please. You don't want to do this.
take her to the storeroom.
no, I'm not going anywhere.
please, you cannot do this.
the evidence I gave you doesn't tell me how Walsh was involved.
he will.
come on. - No.
you cannot do this this way!
sit over there.
springfield, M1A rifle. 308 round.
you know, about four hours ago,
I had a friend of mine- very good friend
named Renee Walker was killed by a rifle just like that.
go to hell.
you first.
the hit on Hassan is all arranged.
Bazhaev and his people are taking care of everything.
you talko no one but me.
we're done here.
don't contact me again until Hassan is dead.
to be honest with you,
Renee Walker was more than just my friend.
but you already know that, don't you?
because you saw us in the bedroom of my apartment.
now, you're either not very good at what you do...
or you wanted her to suffer.
because with that rifle from that range, it was an easy kill shot.
but instead, you shot her...right there two inches below her heart, so she would bleed out slowly.
I watched her gasping for air...
as the blood slowly filled her lungs.
she died in agony, which is exactly what I'm gonna make you do unless you tell me what I want to know.
start talking to me!
you want to know I killed your girlfriend?
I killed her.
I kill your bitch! I did it!
please... please, you've got to stop him. Please.
he needs answers, and he's gonna get 'em.
I can use this. There's enough here.
I don't need any more.
tell him I don't need any more. Please.
you're not going anywhere.
move aside. Move. Move.
please step back from the bodies.
this is now a CTU crime scene.
I need all weapons and documents you found on these people.
this is all we got, sir. None of them had I. D.s on them.
this is the man we're looking for.
his name is Jack Bauer.
now, you need to spread out and check every floor and every exit.
he has a hostage with him, so he won't have gotten far.
Bauer's armed and extremely dangerous, so if you don't want to end up like these people, shoot on sight.
let's go.
so, why don't we start this again.
I already know that you killed Renee Walker.
what I want to know is the name of the Russian pig inside your government that gave the order.
give me a name, and I'll end this quickly. I give you my word.
you think you know about pain?
you don't know anything yet.
give me the name of the person inside your government who wanted Renee Walker dead!
give me the name!
who gave the order?!
who inside your government wanted Renee Walker dead?
all you got to do is give me the name!
you are so stupid.
Renee Walker wasn't a threat to you.
her work was finished. She was done. We were out.
all you had to do is leave us alone.
now, why couldn't you just leave us alone?
I want the name of the person who gave the order to pull the trigger!
who gave the order?!
now! - Did it on my own!
you're lying. You're nothing.
you didn't have the authority.
I want the name!
give me the name!
my name is Pavel Tokarev.
this isn't working.
damn it!
Where's the SIM card for your phone?
Where's the SIM card?!
Where'd you drop it?
you dumb bastard, you swallowed it.
you swallowed it.
this is for my friend.
what do you got?
fine. There's another service hallway.
check all the service hallways over there. Make sure they're locked down.
you guys, I want you to go up there, stay on the third floor.
do it now.
you've reached the mobile number of President Charles Logan.
we can't take your call right now, but if you leave a message, we'll get back to you as soon as we can.
Tracy to the stage.
Hey, hey, hey, where are you going?
they've been paging you for rehearsal!
rehearsal? We did a show last week.
I just came to pick up a paycheck.
no. We do a show every Friday, Tracy.
it's not gonna work.
next Friday is Damon Dash's birthday party.
and the Friday after that there's an orgy over at Elizabeth Hasselbeck's.
yeah? Well, you're part of a team now, okay?
so you have to be in the shows and you have to rehearse.
and when you rehearse, Jenna would really like it
I would like it too
if you would read exactly what's on the cue cards.
it's making everybody crazy.
can't do it.
I'm an improviser.
my acting style is like jazz.
jazz that you laugh at.
just try, okay?
I have a meeting upstairs. I'll be right back.
do you remember that song I recorded last year when I was dating that Persian record producer?
Oh...no.
it's a dance-pop techno hybrid called Muffin Top.
I gave everybody copies at Christmas?
Oh, yeah, right. I don't remember that.
well, apparently it's a number-one hit in Israel.
Hey, Israel. Wow. Yes.
and I noticed we had a couple of minutes left, so I thought maybe I could do it on the show.
okay, you can do the short version.
you should know that Muffin Top is also number four in Belgium.
I said you could do it.
why not?!
Oh. I mean, thank you.
hello.
for over a hundred years, GE has been imagining the future... today.
and I'm here to talk to you today about a wonderful new synergy.
it's called "product integration.
it's revolutionizing the way we monetize broadcast television.
how does it work? Simple.
all you have to do as the writing staff of an NBC show is incorporate positive mentions-- or PosMens--of GE products into your program.
for example, you could write an episode where one of your characters purchases
and is satisfied with...
one of GE's direct-current drilling motors for an offshore or land-based project.
product integration...
setting a new standard in upward revenue stream dynamics.
for all of us.
now, I'd be happy to answer any questions.
I'm sorry. You're saying you want us to use the show to sell stuff?
look, I know how this sounds.
no, come on, Jack. We're not doing that.
we're not compromising the integrity of the show to sell
Wow. This is diet Snapple?
I know, it tastes just like regular Snapple, doesn't it?
you should try Plum-A-Granate.
it's amazing.
I only date guys who drink Snapple.
look, we all love Snapple.
lord knows I do, but focus here.
we're talking about product integration.
no, no. We are not your shills.
Oh! Oh-ho. I'm sorry.
that's right. They're artists, like James Joyce or Strindberg.
get real, kids.
you write skits mocking our presidents to fill time between car commercials.
that's not fair.
Josh gets a lot of fan mail for Gaybraham Lincoln.
did you guys know that Holland is the only country with a national dog?
I didn't know that.
hmm. There's little facts under there.
that's a lunch break, everybody.
back in an hour, please.
um, did you talk to Tracy about reading the cue cards?
I tried.
well, he's not reading them.
he never reads them, Liz.
I'm starting to think... he can't read!
Oh, that-- that's just offensive, Jenna.
I don't know.
have you ever seen him read anything?
of course. Like when we shoot promos.
Hi. I'm Tracy Jordan. I'm black, NBC!
very proud, like peacocks, right, Janet?
hmm.
Hey, Tracy, I missed that last run-through.
could you run it once off cards for me?
Naw, Lemon. I'll do that later. I gotta bounce.
okay, that's the
it says, "Emergency exit only." He couldn't read that?
man, Jenna's really gotten squirrelly since Tracy came along.
it's so sad.
what's really sad is that while she's in this fragile state, none of her friends are messing with her head.
I think we should do something about that.
hmm.
Shh. Okay. All right.
Hey, what are you guys talking about?
Oh. Uh...nothing.
what, is it about me?
okay. Um...
there's a rumor going around that Donaghy has to cut costs around here.
Oh.
Yeah. My friend in accounting, Lando Calrissian, he says Jack's probably gonna have to fire an actor.
Oh.
thank you guys for telling me.
it's like shooting fish in a barrel.
Yeah, if the fish have daddy issues.
I can't believe you guys actually wrote a product integration sketch.
Jack said we had to.
it just seems weird.
this show's not a commercial.
excuse me.
can you tell me where Human Resources is, please?
that way. Thanks.
this is gonna sound crazy, but, um...
Tracy can read, right?
what? Are you serious?
the guy's done dozens of movies.
Yeah, but it's not like his movies seem like he's reading a script.
let's go rescue Karen or whatever.
is there a Cheryl?
then she could tell us where drugs are-- I mean gold
then we got the car chase. I'm getting way too old for this!
was I supposed to say that then?
that's true.
and he never reads the cue cards...
God, I thought all that stuff was just crazy Tracy seeing what he could get away with.
I know, but, you know, it's not surprising.
look at the educational system in this country.
we spend all this money in Iraq, but meanwhile, our inner-city graduation rates are lower than they are in the Sudan.
that doesn't sound right.
maybe it was Sweden. Maybe it was teen pregnancy.
I gotta read more.
what can I do for you?
so we wrote a product integration sketch.
good. But we wanted to run it by you first because it's about how GE is making us do this.
and we were kinda hoping that the GE executive in the sketch could be played by...you.
Oh, I get it
the whole self-referential thing:
Letterman hates the suits, Stern yells at his boss,
nixon's "sock it to me" on Laugh-In.
Yeah.
hippy humor.
that's what I'm going for.
well, as you know, I've been studying comedy and learning what's funny.
I'm watching Friends right now. What happens with Ross and Rachel?
no, no. Don't tell me. Seriously. What were you saying?
so will you do it?
I don't know, Lemon. I'm not an actor.
this is your world.
Oh, come on. You can do this.
you were great in that video.
Yeah!
this is live television.
I've never done anything like that before.
okay, I'll do it.
Ohh! Great, great. Thanks, Jack.
so rehearsal will be tomorrow at 2: 00.
please don't be late.
and I will fax you any changes by 9: 00 a. m.
you're such a Monica!
ah ha! You are.
Uhh.
he never reads anything.
uh, why is Jack Donaghy on the cast list?
Oh, he's gonna do this GE sketch.
it's really funny.
Oh, so he gets to be in sketches, but he's gonna fire one of the real actors?
what?
I got inside information that Jack is gonna fire one of the actors to cut costs.
no. I haven't heard anything like that.
don't worry about it.
Oh, I'm not worried...
because I have something the other actors don't.
a secret weapon.
Oh, don't say your sexuality.
my sexuality!
Oh, God, Jenna, when has that ever worked?
uh, when has it not worked?
it'll be a 45-minute wait.
Oh, will it?
uh, yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, it will.
Yeah, but this is different because I know Jack Donaghy.
I know what he likes.
Yeah, so now you just have to make yourself ten years younger and Asian.
I don't know what to tell you.
they're making me rehearse.
I know Pat Benatar rarely performs live.
scalp the damn tickets.
these are the changes for the sketches that you're in.
cool. I'll read those later, Lemon.
tray... Can you read?
can I read?
please don't get angry.
it's not your fault. It's the system.
did you ever see Hoop Dreams?
it's like that.
so you're asking me if I'm illiterate?
you don't even have to answer me if you don't want to.
just know that if you need a tutor, we will get you a tutor.
if you need to be in fewer sketches until you get more confident, we'll accommodate you, whatever you need.
so I could, like, leave work early if I need a tutor?
Absolutely. We'll work around your schedule.
I can't read, Liz Lemon!
my shameful secret is out.
now you know why I'm always running into the ladies' bathroom.
I can't read!
I sign my name with an X!
I once tried to make mashed potatoes with laundry detergent!
I think I voted for Nader!
I feel as though a great weight has been lifted off of me, Liz Lemon.
today is the first day of the rest of my life.
all thanks to one very, very special white lady.
I'll be in late tomorrow.
damn, George Will just gets more and more conservative.
Hi. Did you tell Jack he can be on the show?
Yeah, he was kind of excited about it, actually.
Oh, yeah, he's very excited.
but you cannot put him on live TV.
Why?
okay.
I'm only showing you this because I care about him so much.
ge Promo.
take one. Action!
did you say, "Action"? - Yes. Action!
could you say it louder, please? - I'm sorry.
action!
ge Promo. Take two.
hello. For over a hundred years
line?
sorry. My bad.
what's the first line?
product integration!
okay.
right, got it. I just need the first word.
product!
what's the second word?
okay, I knew that. Okay, d-d-uh...
if I ask for the line again, don't tell me.
line?
line? - Product integration.
I told you don't give me the line when I ask for the line.
I got it. I got it.
could we get a do-over there?
let's go again, can we?
what?
what is it?
I don't like this at all.
okay, I got it. Let's go again.
the pen doesn't really write. Does that matter?
and I'm here today
my bad. I'm sorry.
Oh...God.
why don't we go to lunch and we'll come back and maybe
let's all go have lunch.
ge Promo. 126.
it's weird. What do I do with my arms?
I've never thought about that before.
is it this?
or, if I may, this?
maybe I should just hold something.
OK, yeah, this feels more natural.
is that right? Yeah.
new synergy"-- does that sound odd to anyone else?
does that sound like "news energy"?
and this satisfies
Oh. Ouch, ouch.
you all right?
could I get a little, uh...
I'm here to talk to you television about the monetizing of today broadcast.
was any of that usable?
ge Promo. 129.
it's called, "racial integration"
no, that's not right, is it?
it's called, "product intergort"-- "intergortian"?
...the way we monetize broadcast television.
how does it work?
Oh!
could we turn off the phones, please?
Oh, I'm sorr--ha! I'm sorry. That's me.
let me turn this thing off here.
I think I just took a picture.
I'm sorry, everybody, there's a pigeon.
...purchases, and is satisfied with--Oh.
142
...in upward revenue stream dynamics.
for all of us.
cut. That's a wrap.
ha! That was fun, you guys.
didn't feel like five days, did it?
no. Nah, that wasn't bad.
everybody have a good weekend.
and... we'll be right back.
Jenna to the stage, please.
Jenna to the stage for Muffin Top.
Hey, Liz?
I'm a little bit nervous about this rehearsal.
Oh, I'm glad you brought that up.
you know, you don't have to do this.
I know how busy you are.
Oh, no, I have to do it.
it's a new challenge, and I like challenges.
I've summited Kilimanjaro.
I've showered with Greta Van Susteren.
I--I'm gonna do this, yeah.
the time, sir.
Oh, that's right. Do you mind?
we'll do it around the corner, okay?
I'll be with you in a minute.
I have a conference with my corporate division head.
Oh, yeah? Are you guys gonna...
...correlate overseas earnings report dynamics?
Yes.
did I just hear Jack?
Oh, no, no, no. Please.
I know for a fact he is talking to his boss right now.
Really?
don't bother him.
fine.
don't.
of course, sir.
I'll look into it right away.
actions speak louder than words. Take care of it.
don't worry, I'll have it on your desk first thing in the morning.
look, I am tired of your promises! I want this thing fixed.
I'm-- I'm on it, sir.
so...
you're Jack's boss, huh?
Oh, well, yeah, that's what they tell me.
I'm Jenna, by the way.
Oh, I, uh, I know who you are.
I'm Ron.
Oh, Ron.
how do you take your coffee, Ron?
I take it? Uh...
I--I take it, uh, with the non-dairy creamer.
Mmm. Yeah. Non-dairy creamer.
yum.
Oh, yeah.
quiet, please!
rehearsing!
from Mr. Donaghy's entrance.
what's up, Mr. Donaghy?
that's Josh's line. Your lines are in blue.
my bad. I'm sorry.
those cards are a little confusing.
Hello, everyone.
thanks for waiting, please. Sit...down.
okay, that's great. Just one thing, sir.
you're looking into the camera a little bit.
no, I'm not.
I want to, but I'm not. No.
could I get two coffee cups?
Yeah, you know, let's take five minutes, actually, uh, everybody, while we get Mr. Donaghy some coffee cups.
I know you want to do this, but I don't think it's working out.
I agree. It's the writing. It's not natural.
Uhh! Really?
you think the problem is the writing?
Yeah. It's clunky.
Wow. Well, I was really trying to help you out of this, but, you know what? You're the boss.
I think I can do it.
no. You should definitely do it.
it'll be hilarious.
Oh, well, that'd be a refreshing change of pace for the show, wouldn't it?
excuse me.
why would Tracy pretend to be illiterate?
to get out of coming to work.
Oh, so first you thought he was illiterate, and now you think he's lazy?
jeez, you are racist.
no. Tracy took advantage of my white guilt, which is to be used only for good, like over-tipping and supporting Barack Obama.
summon.
Hey, Tray.
kenneth told me you finally got in to work.
Yeah, I had to go to reading class.
you hear this mess about sometimes Y being a vowel?
what a world.
Ah...
well, we just wanted to show you the new posters for the show.
Yeah, all right. Cool.
so it's okay to hang these all over the city?
Yeah. It's good.
I like it.
Really?
really.
I'll be leaving early today.
Jenna and Ghostface Killah, to the stage, please, for Muffin Top.
Jack? It's 3: 00 in the morning.
what's wrong?
that's quite a commitment to such terrible writing.
lemon, I don't know how to do this.
I know.
I don't get it. It's not the fear.
I thrive on fear.
you're looking out a fake window right now, by the way.
I bow-hunt polar bear.
I once drove a rental car into the Hudson just to practice escaping.
and it's not the public speaking.
there's just something about performing that I can't wrap my brain around.
all this creative crap.
acting!
Oh...
I've never been able to do it.
never.
grains and cereals are an important
Oh!
line!
damn it! Son of a bitch!
I need your help.
really... Jack Donaghy needs my
don't gloat.
it makes you seem mannish.
okay.
look, this is not your fault.
this whole thing was a bad idea.
we should just have Josh do it, and we'll just tell everyone you're on a business trip.
that's not an option. I have to do it.
once I set my mind to something, I have to accomplish it.
ten years ago, I was an inch-and-a-half shorter than I am today.
sheer willpower.
if I don't figure this thing out by Friday, then failure wins, and that's not acceptable.
Oh, God, the room is spinning.
what do you want from me?
I'm one of your actors. I'm freaking out.
talk me down.
okay, here's your pep talk.
you're not an actor. You're Jack Donaghy, all right?
so quit whining and nut up.
you're right, if you can't do this, you are a failure.
Josh can do this, and earlier today, he ate a club sandwich with the toothpicks still in it.
Jenna can do this, and she was once engaged to David Blaine.
any dumb-dumb can act, Jack, so be a man and get it done.
if you were any other woman on earth... I would be turned on right now.
go home.
get some sleep.
this stays between us, right, Lemon?
well, I don't think I have to worry about my job anymore.
and I didn't bother Jack at all.
Oh, good for you.
that's right. I took your advice.
I hooked up with his boss.
who, Ron? - Mm-hmm.
that guy's an extra on the show.
no. He said he was Jack's boss.
no. In the sketch. He doesn't even have a line.
he doesn't have lines?
don't eat in costume!
give me a break. I'm just
but he was yelling at Jack.
actions speak louder than words. Take care of it.
don't worry, sir, I'll have it on your desk first thing in the morning.
I am tired of your promises. I just want this thing fixed now!
I'm on it, sir.
what is the point of belonging to the Extras Guild if I cannot get health coverage for my foot, hmm?
EW.
Oh, God, Jenna.
I told you, don't listen to rumors.
but Frank and Toofer said to me
Frank and Toofer? That's where you're getting your information?
they're messing with you!
no. They wouldn't do that to me.
Yeah, they would.
Oh!
I am gonna get back at them... using my sexuality.
do you have any left?
Jenna, Ghostface Killah, and Yo-Yo Ma /to the stage, please, for Muffin Top.
where the hot lesbians at, Lemon? - I knew it!
you can read!
fine.
Yes, I'm literate!
I even have a column in Ebony called Musings!
you are unbelievable.
I'm unbelievable?
what about your racist mess? Thinking a grown man is illiterate.
that's the subtle racism of lowered expectations.
bing Crosby said that.
no, Bill Cosby said that.
that's racist.
look, we can all agree Liz is generally pretty racist.
the point is, you have people counting on you.
you can't be finding excuses not to be here.
but this job is hard!
I just want to be able to do what I want to do.
you know, I once shot a whole movie without ever getting out of my car?
Yeah, I paid to see that. That was supposed to be a western.
you're not a big shot movie star anymore, Tray.
you're the star of TGS, and you will read the lines as written, starting tonight because this show is important.
I set a very high standard for myself, and I expect the same of the professionals who work with me.
when Gaybraham Lincoln gets hit in the crotch, can I go cross-eyed?
Oh, yes, do that. That's hilarious!
hey have you seen Frank or Toofer?
the standards lady is saying that my moaning in Muffin Top is too graphic.
which of these is less offensive?
or...
both sound good to me.
Hello, Ron.
I would just hate for Muffin Top to get cut because of a standards problem.
I've already posted it on my weblog though I'll be doing it.
Jenna, we're not gonna cut it.
are you messing with me?
because people around here keep messing with me.
I'm not messing with you.
so which one? Ahh!
or, ohhh!
uh, I guess... Uh, "ahh ahh! Ahh.
Oh, Hey. Look, it's no big deal, but we had to make some changes in your sketch, okay?
I have new pages for you.
you do?
Yeah. Tracy is now in it now, so we had to change some of the cues.
also, the opening VT is cut, so you just go right out, okay?
Oh, and, um, you all say the last line together.
Wow. So, uh...
so you're gonna be great. Have fun.
lemon, these pages are blank.
Oh.
never mind.
withdrawn.
and, remember, don't look into the camera!
yeah?
can I tell you a secret?
sure.
we've been working together a while, and I know this may sound crazy, but I've been watching you.
I have this fantasy of sneaking up to the roof of 30 Rock, and we make love while looking out at the city
okay, let me guess.
you figured out Frank and I lied to you, so to get even, you're trying to get me naked on the roof and leave me there.
nice try.
Where's Frank?
but we're cool, right, Mr. Donaghy?
no, you're all fired.
no, you're all fired.
Hey, good job the other night.
Oh, you mean on the show? Thanks.
what were you watching?
nothing. Uh...
bloomberg.
hmm.
don't be cute, Lemon. You're too old for that.
good God!
Mr. Donaghy, open up! Please?
does she know we went off the air two minutes ago?
no, she does not. - Smart move.
Hey.
Hey. - Wow.
hot dog times, huh?
I only eat them on special occasions.
what's the special occasion?
I decided to eat one.
fair enough.
you going this way?
uh, no, I'm going in here, actually.
I'll see you later. - Okay, bye.
church on a Tuesday?
but he seemed so normal.
I know, right?
and, uh, this is Kenneth, one of our pages. Kenneth, this is Devin Banks, our Vice President of West Coast News,
web Content and Theme Park Talent Relations.
Hey, Devin, you better watch out, Kenneth might take your job one day.
or your job, Jack.
or his job!
why don't we just, uh
Devin. - Yeah.
morning. My notes.
Ugh, dude, how can we be wearing the same outfit?
you saw me leave the apartment this morning.
I saw you put it on and I thought it looked nice.
how long are you staying with me?
indefinitely.
huh.
Liz, I want you to meet Devin Banks.
he's in from L. A.
Devin, this is Lemon.
Hi. - Hi.
love the show. - Thank you.
look, I gotta go. Thanks for the tour.
you guys... you're the real heroes.
they get younger every year.
these punks who think they can take down Jack Donaghy.
you're worried about that guy?
banks is in New York for a reason, and I intend to send him back to L. A.
wow, if this turns into a showdown, you guys could settle it with a talking like this contest.
banks is no slouch.
he pioneered the concept of ten second internet sitcoms.
making it happen
honey, I'm home.
Oh, great.
we made it
I'm sure he's here to dazzle the old men with his webisode ideas, but I have ideas too, Lemon.
like what?
something big.
a live television special with fireworks.
they can do shapes now.
one time, I saw a cowboy hat.
boy, you're gonna need more than that though.
maybe you're right.
I want you on this, Lemon.
those jokes you wrote for my Mitt Romney fundraiser, they were top-notch.
those weren't jokes.
that was an appeal for a return to common sense and decency.
well, it got big laughs.
Yeah, we should do a sketch about alien abductions.
Yeah.
like a Lamaze class in Roswell.
dude, what's with the ridiculous hat and glasses?
I'm incognito.
some dude is trying to slap me with a subpoena for a paternity suit.
but the kid ain't mine.
how do you know it's not your child?
cause I remember that girl and it's impossible.
I never got out of my car and she never got all the way out of her tollbooth!
okay.
let's get back to work, guys.
how about a sketch about Bill Clinton eating hamburgers?
that stinks. What is this, 1992?
eh, what do you want from me?
I'm not a comedy writer.
Wha--?
Mr. Jordan...
you've been served.
you know, the more I think about it, the more jazzed I'm getting about these fireworks.
maybe don't pitch the fireworks thing right away.
I'm gonna come up with a couple other things I think you'll like better.
well, what I'm saying is, that is what we're selling at the pitch meeting, Lemon:
spectacle.
it's what people want. The Romans knew it.
Louis XIV knew it. Wolfowitz knows it.
Mr. Donaghy.
as instructed, I was spying on Mr. Banks.
and there's something you should know.
so...
what team do you play for?
Oh, it's not really a team.
it's just a bunch of guys who like doing gymnastics.
you know...
I'm gonna be in town for a little while.
maybe we could... get together.
my, you're friendly!
good God.
Devin is gay.
he's even more powerful than I thought.
maybe you should seduce him and get him to tell you all his secret plans.
so Mr. Donaghy, what can I do for you?
I heard you were talking with my colleague Devin Banks.
did he tell you why he was in New York?
no, sir, we just talked about Anderson Cooper mostly.
you should get to know Devin.
tell him all of your television ideas.
you know, he started off as a page just like you.
Really? So did I!
you say the right things, ask him the right questions,
I'm sure he could open some doors for you.
okay. What kinds of questions?
I'll write them down for you.
you call him, tell him you got two tickets for A Chorus Line for tonight.
and, uh...Kenneth...
have you ever used bronzer?
Dr. Spaceman, when they check my DNA, will they tell me what diseases I might get or help me to remember my ATM pin code?
Absolutely.
science is whatever we want it to be.
I'll let you know as soon as I have the results.
I already know the results. The kid is not mine.
boy, it's crazy to think we used to settle questions of paternity by dunking a woman in water until she admitted she made it all up.
Mm...different time, the '60s.
but he was going to church in the middle of the day on a Tuesday.
what do you think that means?
it means he probably murdered someone and found God while he was in jail.
maybe he's born-again? Ugh, boy.
we'll spend our Saturdays in Central Park trying to "save" gay rollerbladers.
I just wish people would tell you immediately when you meet them, "Hi, I am so and so. Here's all the weird stuff about me.
Ah, that would never work.
if I told my wife in college, "Hey, I'm gonna lose all this beautiful hair and fart in my sleep for the next 20 years,
she never would have married me.
love is like an onion, and you peel away layer after stinky layer until you're just... weeping over the sink.
is that my sweatshirt?
Hey!
Oh...sorry.
no, no-- Ugh!
and I have an idea for a show about a teacher named Art.
I call that one "Art School.
and one about a Jewish guy who opens an ice cream parlor.
that one's called "Ice Cream Cohen.
and a drama about two cops, one named Cash and one named Carry.
I don't have a title for that one.
but then also-- - Kenneth.
can I offer you a libation?
I have champagne, vodka, absinthe-- - Fruit punch, please.
right.
you'll excuse me.
I'll go slip into something a little more comfortable.
like in the movies!
so Mr. Banks...
what brings you to New York?
Oh, just making the rounds.
hmm.
what projects are you working on near-slash-long term?
Oh my. That's an awful short robe.
I know.
I had to cut it down myself.
Oh, Kenneth.
you know, I was a page.
and when I was in the program, we'd give each other a hand.
can you give me a hand, Kenneth?
for a fellow page, anything!
great.
tell me about Jack Donaghy.
Tracy, I have the results of your DNA test.
now, I'm very serious about doctorpatient confidentiality...
so I'm gonna have to ask at all four of us keep this to ourselves.
what's the verdict, Doc?
good news.
you are not the father of that child.
Yeah! - However, according to my DNA database, you are a direct descendant of our third president.
no, Tracy.
our third president. Thomas Jefferson.
Jefferson? Not possible.
Yeah, that's a white dude.
Yeah, but that guy was into black chicks.
I'm surprised I am not a descendant.
these DNA results show that genetically you're mostly white.
that ridiculous.
I can't be white.
my whole persona is based on an in-depth analysis of the differences between black and white.
this is how black people dial a phone.
this is how white people dial a phone.
I gotta call my wife.
what can I do for you?
I think we're way past that, Jack.
let's be honest with each other.
I'll go first.
I'm gay and I want your job.
Devin, I'm straighter than you are gay and I leave particles of guys like you in my wind.
I'm not afraid of you.
Yeah, well, you should be.
lets just see how little shakes out in the meeting.
yeah...
let's.
Oh, by the way, a little slim-waisted birdie in a page jacket told me you got nothing.
you're going down.
no, Devin.
I don't do that.
no, no, no.
are you kidding me?
you eat too many hot dogs.
please, I am concerned.
I copied this article on sodium for you.
fine.
but I will be reporting this to the Fox Problem Solvers.
Oh, boy.
what is this, Bible study?
excuse me one second.
Hey. - Hi.
I didn't know you came here.
Oh, well, I haven't been in a super long time.
but, yeah, my parents used to make me go every week.
well, welcome back.
Thanks.
you're doing the right thing.
go ahead, have a seat.
okay, everybody. Let's get started.
Hi, my name is Floyd and I'm an alcoholic.
Hi, Floyd.
Hi, Floyd. Uh...
it's been four years since my last drink.
but I just broke up with my girlfriend, so I guess today
I'll be talking about my issues with women and trust.
the dishonesty that my dad...
you stayed?
Pete, you don't understand.
he was pouring his guts out.
it was like eavesdropping on somebody else's therapy.
it was great.
Yeah, that's not okay.
but I just feel like I've known him forever now, you know?
I mean, his father was awful.
awful.
and he told this story about trying to make French toast for his mom when he was a kid and he started crying!
I love him.
Liz, what is your plan here? What are you gonna do?
you're gonna fake being an alcoholic for the rest of your life?
I don't know, okay?
one day at a time, Pete.
I'm gonna take it one day at a time.
I want you to tell me everything that happened last night.
the curtains open on a group of chorus line dreamers in 1970s leotards
stop that. I'm not talking about the show.
the only reason I sent you to Banks was to get information.
why were you telling him anything?
I'm sorry, sir.
I had to keep talking just to stop him from putting his fingers in my mouth.
Kenneth, you are the worst gay bait ever.
you used me?
for television.
Kenneth, I humiliated you for television.
like on What's Happening when that man used Rerun to bootleg that Doobie Brothers concert!
exactly.
and I need to humiliate you again.
I got a very important meeting coming up and Banks cannot be there.
and you want me to kill him.
no.
I need you to distract him.
you gotta make sure he doesn't leave that hotel room tomorrow morning.
I'll do it.
just like Sidney Bristow on Alias, I'll use my sexuality as a weapon.
to the wig shop!
lemon, it's on.
banks is gunning for me.
8: 00 a. m. Thursday. Are you ready?
Yeah, I've been working on it all week.
I don't know what happened in your life that cause you to develop a sense of humor as a coping mechanism.
maybe it was some sort of brace or corrective boot you wore during childhood.
but in any case, I'm glad you're on my team.
Ah.
I can't do this sketch!
what? Why?
because you can't have a white dude playing a criminal.
that's a negative portrayal of my people!
Tracy, you're not white.
I don't know who I am anymore!
there's been a black man inside of me for a long time, now there's a white guy up in here too.
it's like the audience for a Bobby McFerrin concert up in here!
Tracy, you should be honored to be a descendant of Thomas Jefferson.
of course you would say that.
you wish you were white.
Wh--how dare you?
I happen to know what it means to be proud of one's heritage.
my great-great-great grandfather was one of the few black men who had achieved an officer's rank during the Civil War.
this is a picture of him shaking hands with Ulysses S. Grant.
Yeah, let me check that out.
I think he's shaking hands with Robert E. Lee.
dude, your relative fought for the South.
you're related to a black Confederate officer.
that's messed up.
see?
now you know what I'm going through.
do you think these other black guys are his prisoners or what?
maybe Jack's special could be based on a holiday.
what's left in April?
arbor Day, the Boston Marathon and Hitler's birthday.
So...you got options.
Hey, Liz?
Hi. - Hi. Hey.
could I-- can I talk to you for a sec?
Yeah. All right.
I'm sorry to do this at work, I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
you weren't at the meeting today.
Oh! No, I'm okay.
okay, good.
I just wanna offer my support.
if you ever need to talk to someone,
I'd be more than happy to take you out for coffee.
[silently] No.
do you have time now?
sure.
Oh.
sorry. - Sorry.
all right, Tracy.
I have the DNA results right here.
are you ready to find out who your biological father is?
I think I am.
meet your father, Tom.
No!
I hate you, Thomas Jefferson!
I don't know who I am anymore!
Hey, Maury, he a dog.
he a dog.
Sally Hemings just called you a dog, Thomas Jefferson.
no matter, Maurence.
I'm here for you, Tracy Jordan.
I rode a horse all the way from heaven to tell you something important.
america, which I invented...
which I invented, is a great country because we are not burdened by our pasts.
embrace who you are, Tracy Jordan.
and may the Force be with you always.
I have never seen so much come out of one pigeon!
Yeah, I think it might've been sick.
or maybe the little guy ate a cigarette or something.
Hey, do you wanna come over?
my friend Pete is staying with me and we've decided that we're gonna do this thing where every night we watch one of the AFI top 100 movies.
how many have you gone through?
well, I only have Star Wars and Tootsie, so we just keeping watching those two over and over.
I'm in.
but only 'cause your friend's there.
otherwise it would be too tempting for this to turn into a...a real date.
what do you mean?
well...
obviously, since we're in the same group, we can never date.
it's against the rules.
right, but isn't that one of those rules like, "don't walk between the subway cars,
and all the cool people just do it anyway?
Liz, I need the rules.
the last time I drank I ended up doing a man-on-the street commercial for Tarzan on Ice.
it was awesome!
I mean, he was swinging on his skates!
and the little monkey was funny.
I wanna see it again!
and I didn't even see it.
so all the rules. - Yeah.
but I'll buy the popcorn.
Kenneth, what are you doing here?
well, I was in the neighborhood.
hmm.
do you want me to dance for you?
Yeah.
that's the business.
Oh, man.
Yeah.
touch your belt buckle.
Oh, touch the peacock.
Oh, you're a peacock.
the time is now 7: 52.
you warlock!
you came to entrance me.
donaghy sent you.
where the hell is Lemon?
I can't find her.
Hey. - Oh, hey.
good morning. - Good morning.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I guess I kinda fell asleep on your legs.
I know. It's weird.
I've never let anybody put their head that close to my feet before.
um, do you want some coffee?
Aaagh.
Oh boy.
pins and needles. - Are you all right?
Aah!
both my legs are asleep.
okay, all right. Here we go. Come on.
hop up.
here we go.
all right?
walk it off, scarecrow.
that was really fun last night.
I, uh...
I think Tootsie's a very well-crafted movie.
Yeah, they use it as an example in all the screenplay books.
Oh.
look...
I would really love to do this again sometime, but I...
you know, I don't think it's a good idea.
Bye.
I
Floyd, I'm not an alcoholic.
I lied.
I followed you to that church because I have a crush on you and I let you think that I belonged there.
what? - I know.
I know it makes me seem just nut-log Ann Heche crazy, but if there's any way that you could see past it
No!
no, that
I said stuff in there that even my best friends don't know.
I know.
that's supposed to be a safe place!
I know.
it is extremely not okay that you did that!
what are you still doing here?
don't you have a breakfast meeting with Jack?
Oh, oh!
Floyd, I'm sorry. I have to go.
no, no, no. No, I'm--I'm going.
I feel more confused and betrayed than those people that worked with Tootsie.
bear with me. Sorry.
gentlemen, lady, if Jack's not ready,
I'd like to tell you about the future of entertainment.
what am I talking about?
celebrity snuff.
reality content.
made exclusively for your mobile phone.
now, what's that?
mc Lyte just murdered Danny Bonaduce?
Oh, thanks, phone!
or...
fireworks.
what?
banks here wants to make TV smaller.
but broadcast television is big.
it's about spectacle.
the kinds of shows we watched as kids sitting on our neighbor's knee.
inaugurations, the Super Bowl, the Oscars.
that's why we got into television in the first place.
that's why I give you...
the Rockefeller Center Salute to Fireworks!
can you get those fireworks that look like cowboy hats?
you sure can.
thank you so much.
I appreciate your patience.
Mr. Donaghy, Liz Lemon is on the phone.
don't bother coming in, Lemon. You're off the project.
I'll do it without you.
Jack, I'm so sorry.
it's just, you know, I told you about the Flower Guy and
I don't have time for this.
you've made your priorities clear.
I hope he's worth it.
I found a biography on your ancestor.
it's called, Confederate Monster: The Tobias Spurlock Disaster.
yo, Toof, how you doing?
not good.
the barn that John Wilkes Booth hid in belonged to Tobias Spurlock.
well, listen.
dream Jefferson told me some amazing stuff.
he said it's not about who you were, it's about who you are right now.
no, Toofer.
give in to your heritage.
kill Tracy.
let me shoot something at you.
I came up with a movie idea about all of this.
and I want you to write it.
okay, what's the movie?
it's the story of Thomas Jefferson, only thing we're gonna do it like Norbit, where I play all the parts.
that's actually hilarious.
it's not a comedy.
it's a drama.
Oh.
Hi...um...
I'm really sorry about what I did, and I know that you can't forgive me.
but just to even things out...
here's all of my weird secret stuff.
I have been sexually rejected by not one, but two guys who later went to Clown College.
I get super nervous whenever I hear a vacuum cleaner because when I was a kid, my mom used to turn on the vacuum to drown out the sound of her and my dad fighting.
which is why I rarely vacuum my apartment.
Like...never.
I have had three donuts so far today.
uh, once in college, I pooped my pants a little bit at a Country Steaks all-you-can-eat buffet, and I didn't leave until I finished my second plate of shrimp.
a couple months of ago I went on a date with my cousin.
wow, I-- I am a mess.
there is an 80% chance in the next election that I will tell all my friends
I am voting for Barack Obama, but I will secretly vote for John McCain.
here's one, um...
when I was a kid,
I used to put on my fanciest nightgown and then I would mix orange soda and cream soda in a champagne glass and I would sit in the dark and watch The Love Boat.
consequently, I have some weird sexual fantasy stuff about Gopher from The Love Boat.
and I...lied.
I have had five donuts today.
so, um...that's my deal.
now we're even.
you know, the Roomba is a nice, quiet alternative to a vacuum.
thank you, that's uh... that's a good tip.
and in the interest of full disclosure, I also have a sexual fantasy about Gopher.
except mine's the one from Caddyshack.
well, that makes sense 'cause he's a very good dancer.
Oh, boy.
I really should've been at that meeting.
welcome to the Rockefeller Center Salute to Fireworks!
now without further ado, three hours of fireworks!
wait, fireworks?
in Midtown?
on a day that is not the Fourth of July?
Oh, my God.
Oh, boy.
that's gonna scare a lot of people.
sir, the Mayor.
shut it down!
shut it down!
Oh, boy.
Oh, the cowboy hat.
this better be important, jack. I was in the middle of bidding on a bag of bras on ebay.
lemon, hank hooper is on his way up from philadelphia, and he wants to meet with both of us.
why does he want to meet me? Do you think it's a good thing?
it's not, hon.
I saw that in a movie once, but in the movie, the guy was dead.
nice tie, jack. - How long have you been there?
I was sitting in that chair a minute ago.
Nope. That was me. What can I say? I smell like leather.
and you must be elizabeth lemon.
well, I'll be bake mcbrided. I know a philly gal when I hug one.
now, elizabeth, I like to look someone in the eye and smile when I say that what you're doing is bad.
it's just horrible.
without tracy, your show is like my cholesterol.
the numbers are killing me. So I'm gonna canc TGS.
Hank, as you know, tonight is TGS's 100th episode.
and we've been getting some good media buzz.
got on wikipedia this week.
so you did 99 shows against all odds and reason.
that's something. Now it's time to rest. - Really?
you want to cancel the only show on your network starring a 42-year-old woman?
a show that is number one in its time slot among men 18 to 49 months left in prison?
I thought this company was a family, but I guess it's that austrian family and I am the girl in the basement, and you are the dad who has been brutally
thank you, lemon.
what liz is neglecting to tell you is that tracy jordan is back.
well, that's something.
and I would consider it a personal favor if you would let them do the 100th episode and then reevaluate the show with tracy in it.
all right. You get one more shot.
just like the army doctor said to me after my weekend in okinawa.
you know, jack, i'm amazed at how much you will stick your neck out for your people.
it's no wonder you're here with us good folks at kabletown instead of running GE.
they're mean.
Jack welch once smacked a pretzel out of my hand at the super bowl.
is tracy back? I'd hate to think I just lied to hank.
geez, I'll get it done. You know I'll do whatever it takes.
Lemon-style.
but you're gonna get me another sandwich or I'm gonna cut your face up so bad you'll have a chin.
I will waste you! - You'll have to go through this old bastard first.
and I don't really think it's fair for me to be on a jury because I'm a hologram.
what is the holdup with tracy? I thought you found him.
I did find him, but he's still crazy.
he thinks he can't be funny anymore because now he's a big oscar winner. People respect him too much.
he told me he feels like a bartram's scrub-hairstreak trying to crawl back into its silky cocoon.
which is a butterfly metaphor, by the way, and not, as I first thought, a list of african-american hair products.
well, you just need to turn the beautiful butterfly back into a drunk, incompetent caterpillar.
and I have a plan. I booked him on every morning show in new york.
Tracy will destroy all his goodwill in time for rehearsal.
I've been prepping him all week.
so, tracy jordan, my wife joy and I were at mar-a-lago
Jesus was black!
just get him back in time for the show. I have a very full plate.
Really? Is it from that pie place?
and I'm tired of going to bat for you and your show.
Oh, okay. Fine.
but just to be clear - There is no pie.
okay.
who wears a swimsuit to denny's that's her - that's me - that's pam the overly-confident, morbidly obese woman.
I can't sit in a booth! - And cut.
congratulations, everyone.
in 100 shows, we've done pam 107 times.
can you believe it's been five years since we first started doing this?
um, that wasn't me. There used to be another guy.
I don't think so. - Happy 100th show, miss maroney.
Danny and I were just talking about what an amazing five years we've had.
I will choke you to death with your boyfriend's wig!
give me back my man, bitch!
can you reminisce about something that's happened since I've been here, 'cause I couldn't see any of that.
I'll never forget what you said to me after that first show, miss maroney.
terrific show, ma'am.
if I know anything about television, the girlie show is a hit.
Oh, please. If this turkey goes 100 episodes, i'll have your baby.
I said that? I was so young.
wait. I saw that. How? Am I dead?
well, it's been 100 episodes.
I better lay you across my grandmother's lap in the mating shed.
but seriously, imagine if jenna really was a mother.
it would be horrible.
the only thing I want latched to my funbags are celebrity djs.
I don't know, miss maroney. I think you'd make a wonderful parent.
you could sing the baby to sleep and tell it fairy tales and act out all the witch parts.
you're serious?
you albino goon. - I wish.
albinos get to be watchers in the mating shed.
I can't even imagine you pregnant.
a picture of you in us weekly next to natalie portman in the same maternity outfit.
please welcome tracy jordan.
Tracy! Tracy. Tracy?
why don't you shut your mouth, back that ass up and make me a sandwich?
he's awesome.
you are still in character as the verbally abusive d'jeffrey.
I mean, he's become such a part of him.
so, tracy jordan.
you asked to come on our show because you had a revelation about your post-oscar trip to africa.
I lied to all you ugly white ladies. I didn't go to africa.
I was hiding in a warehouse in queens, watching vintage pornography.
I love your honesty.
it's because you didn't feel like your authentic self that you walked away from success.
that's actually very brave. Don't you think?
No! It's unbrave! You should hate me!
I can't. You fly free.
I'm a bird in a cage.
Hey, you got to stay around. We've got our no-cook cooking, hair make-unders.
what does that even mean?
it's new haircuts, but you can make salads with them.
a true artist... He feels things we don't.
this is todon NBC.
no, we can't do another pam. Not tonight.
Frank, what is this? "broken keyboard alk show"?
I write what I know. Also I broke my keyboard.
no, we're throwing everything out and starting over.
only home runs, guys. Focus up.
it's just hard to concentrate. It's so nice working outside.
Tracy, how'd it go? Are you on your way back?
it was a disaster! - What happened? What about our plan?
I'm so beloved, I can do no wrong. Now everyone's after me.
unicef, the gates foundation. And what is farm aid?
is it a drink? Is it a drug?
is it a bandage you put on a barn?
see, that's the kind of lazy stand-up i'll never do again.
Tracy, just come back, do the show tonight, and we'll figure all this out.
spells "full," because you're full of b. s.liz lemon.
listen to me. There's still time.
the media won't let you embarrass yourself.
be like michael mcdonald and take it to the streets.
get the public to hate you, and the media will follow.
and then you'll get your old life back. Trust me.
you better be right, liz lemon,'cause I can't take much more of this.
I think bono got in my limo.
Liz! Do you think i'd be a good mother?
no. And I wasn't even drinking anything.
I just feel like I'm at a point in my life where I'm starting to have this real desire to nurture...
my career. I think pregnancy would be a great pr move.
Oh, my god. You want a baby to help your career?
tgs may be going away.
being pregnant is a great excuse for why I stopped working instead of the truth.
I'm in my 40s, very difficult, and not that good at playila realite.
Jenna, think about this. You will have a child.
who will grow up to be a little gay fancy man.
well, good luck finding a man willing to ride that crazy train.
I'll have you know I talked with a man this morning who thinks i'd be a wonderful mother.
he must be an idiot.
he is an idiot.
what about a sketch about how the empire state building is controlling us with electricity?
come on, get out of here.
just maybe one more turn.
then I can go home to my sweetheart.
I told her boy i'd hit a home run for him tomorrow night.
here we go.
damn it! I'm getting too old for this "shh" sound that comes from this gas pipe.
who are you? You're so handsome.
I'm jack donaghy, ceo of general electric.
who are you?
I'm jack donaghy. - You were jack donaghy.
you were magnificent. - I'm still magnificent.
no. I come from an alternate universe in which
I followed our plan for world domination.
I run the general. I own an nfl team.
I guest-starred on entourage. What do you do?
I'll tell you what I don't do.
wear a striped tie with a striped shirt.
it's called "power clashing" and I do it because I can.
I wore this on the january cover of meetings magazine.
we made the cover during meetings history month?
I made the cover. - What happened to you, jack?
you were supposed to spend six months in tv as part of your climb up the ge ladder.
you've been here five years. And here...
isn't even ge anymore. It's kableclown.
town," donaghy, and that's not funny.
it was funny when I said it on my syndicated radio show.
you bastard. I'm doing fine!
you used to be a shark. - I still am.
look at my claws! - Sharks don't have claws.
you don't even know what a shark is anymore!
Oh, god. - Do you know why?
no. Liz... Lemon.
she became your focus at the expense of your own ambition.
you should have realized within a week that lemon was a black hole, unworthy of our mentorship.
and now it's five years later, and what are you doing?
are you building factories in bangalore?
are you dining in the palin white house?
no. you're approvitgs wrap gifts.
baseball caps with stupid sayings from the show written on them.
what the hell is a "pwomp"?
it's when two fat people - I don't care!
what's happened to you? To us?
we make me sick.
Mr. Donaghy?
what? - Yes, tom?
the gas leak has spread to this floor.
you got to clear out before you start seeing things.
thank you, tom. - I'll clear you out!
Oh, okay.
the real jack donaghy could handle a little gas leak!
Hey, look. Tracy jordan is ironically reappropriating his bad past behavior as a commentary on fitzgerald's dictum that there are no second acts in american life.
I want to take a picture of him with my old-fashioned camera.
I can't swim! - Damn it!
he just pulled me out of the water and said,"don't tell anyone I did this.
I didn't even get a chance to congratulate him on his oscar.
modesty and heroism.
two words forever synonymous with tracy jordan.
Tracy jordan saves drowning man"?
Ah, come on! - Why is tracy off rescuing people?
why isn't he here? - He will be, I promise.
and we need to be ready. Lutz, what are you working on?
breathing through my mouth so I don't smell the throw-up on my shirt.
I would take my shirt off, but I visited my rescue chimp for his birthday last week, and another chimp got mad and bit my nipple off.
he played with it, and then he kissed it, and then he ate it.
damn it, lutz. Focus up.
Where's my computer?
Cerie, did you not bring my computer down? - You said you were writing.
I've only seen you use that computer to look at pictures of nate berkus.
Pwomp!
Hey, jack, you're friends with jeter and springsteen, right?
can you call and see if they'll be in the cold open?
they'd have to kiss. - Oh, really, lemon?
you still need my help?
five years of my business life wasted, and I'm still supposed to hold your hand.
your wet, yet somehow flaky hand.
what just happened? - You happened.
sideways jack was right.
sideways what? - In here!
did you also have to evacuate the nbc store?
no, it's just empty.
this tv nonsense was supposed to be my stepping stone, and instead, it's my gravestone.
and do you know whose fault that is?
sort of feel like you're gonna say leno. - you.
I got so sucked into trying to repair you that I became the american auto industry, failing to recognize that you can't fix a lemon.
wow, yeah, because the last five years have been so great for me with you as my mentor.
I was better off before we met. - So what's your point, lemon?
you'd rather be doing the girlie show and going home to dennis?
I didn't say that. But at least dennis was always there for me.
he's the only guy I can say that about.
I dragged you down? Opposite!
I should have gone with my gut and fired you when we first met.
what? Flashback, please.
uh, pete, hang back. - Yeah, you bet.
we have a problem. - I can explain. My zipper broke.
I don't think liz lemon's female voice is a good match for tracy jordan.
firing lemon will send a message to the whole staff.
no, no, you can't fire liz. This show is her life.
she hasn't got much going on. She threw a birthday party for her tv.
if you fire liz, then - Then I quit.
you'll never succeed by sticking your neck out for someone like her.
but if that's how you feel, so be it.
the important thing is that I fire someone...
Pete. - You tried to fire me?
and then a week later, you're like,"oh, I want to mentor you. Unlikely friendship.
who do you think you are? - I'll tell you who I was.
that guy that fired pete. And he could have run ge, but instead, he got lemoned.
I should have fired you from my life.
I knew you were supposed to push, but I didn't say anything.
the msg is delicious today.
I'm so glad that you're able to meet me on my break.
is this just to talk, or will you be activating my electric underwear?
just to talk.
Paul, do you think i'd be a good mother? - Of course not.
and I'd be a terrible father. I mean, what if we had a child that was prettier than us?
we'd have to leave it in a desert.
but kenneth thinks i'd make a good mother.
is that something you want?
wasn't something I thought about until kenneth said i'd be good at it.
and of course, it'd be great for my career.
everyone would talk about my crazy name choice.
right now, it's between "frisbeeface" and "glock," gender irrelevant.
I love you, jenna maroney.
I want to hogtie you and hide you in the luggage compartment of a greyhound bus with just a bowl of dirty water.
I love you too. - But I don't know.
I mean, kenneth parcell may be the only man in the world who thinks you should have a child.
break's over, paul. Crew meeting in lady chantarelle's office.
he's pissed.
Hey, dummy. What?
you look good. You lose weight or something?
your neck, it looks looser. - What are you doing here, dennis?
I got your message. - What message?
Dennis, it's dummy. I miss you. Come see me.
things were better five years ago, jack.
I was in my 30s and everything.
you've reached dennis' voicemail. "how you doing?
get out of here, joey. I'm recording my voicemail message.
is that real?
okay, I did call you, but I was not in my right mind.
I mean, how could I be, to call you after everything you've done?
good evening, sir. I'm chris hansen with dateline nbc.
can I ask you what you're doing here tonight?
Yeah, I'm here to boff some chick named mary.
threesome? How about it, huh?
it's tonya, right? It's wonderful service.
could you maybe not hit on the waitress in front
chew and screw! Run, dummy.
damn it, dennis! I checked a coat.
but you called me, liz. - Oh, whatever.
cause down deep, you still got all kinds of queer feelings for me.
that's why I knew someday you'd be all vulnerable from a gas leak or a coma or a super period.
you're disgusting. - And I would be there for you.
no. You know what I feel?
you were a mistake that I made at a time in my life when I could afford to make mistakes.
that's what I miss, dennis, not you.
okay, gang, they fixed the gas leak. They're airing out the studio. We can start heading back up.
whoa, hold on a second. You think I'm just gonna give up now, huh?
I'm a duffy, liz, and us duffys, we didn't give up when we got kicked out of ireland.
we didn't give up when america sent us back.
and we didn't give up when ireland then just set us adrift on a log, all right?
come on, it's not over, liz.
miss lemon's gonna get Mr. Jordan back.
we're gonna do the best show ever.
and out on the plaza, a bird landed on my apple.
I thought he was gonna eat it, but he just sat there.
what's next?
a different bird landing on a different apple?
where are you, tray?
I'm back, liz lemon. - Tracy's back!
Yeah! - Yes!
I'm gonna need an obama cold open, a fart doctor, and you know what?
write up that bum's empire state building idea.
fart doctor.
no, I mean I'm back to where I was yesterday.
I can't get anyone mad at me.
I even called a woman's basketball team "nappy-headed hos,
but apparently, i'm allowed to talk like that. why?
Tracy, come on.
Tracy jordan? Why isn't he here?
I just had a meeting with news down on four.
Brian williams sure gets close to you when he talks.
very feminine energy.
anyway, I thought i'd just swing by and introduce myself to tracy jordan, but
Ah! He is here.
you know, he just likes to learn his lines in the bathroom and communicate by phone.
actors, am I right?
you know, I once had to speak to the screen actors guild.
bunch of nutjobs.
but you couldn't make movies and tv without 'em.
I'm just kidding!
I mean, look at march of the penguins.
who was in that?
good luck tonight. You're gonna need it.
Tracy, you can do this.
you have to be at the show tonight.
Tracy who?
I don't even know who I am anymore.
look, you think the world has turned its back on you?
I know a place where that's not true.
a place where you can remember the man you used to be.
a place where you can eat buffet ribs while someone's daughter shakes her crack at you.
Tracy jordan, I am taking you to a strip club.
Oh, excuse me, miss. How much is a lap dance?
I'm a little light on cash, but I have a paypal account.
Oh, my god. Tracy jordan?
that's right. Party time.
when I saw you in hard to watch...
no, no, keep it light.
you inspired me to contact my biological father.
no daddy stuff.
I hadn't spoken to him in 13 years.
maybe show him your butt.
there are tears falling on her boobies, liz lemon.
I know you've been molested.
that's how we all got here, but I don't want to hear about it.
I just wanted to let you know that I'm going into the navy.
because like you said in your movie,"i invent my tomorrow.
but I wasn't even supposed to say that.
the line was,"shereen,
I hope Dr. Mogutu has good news about my endoscopy,
but I couldn't get it right, so they told me to improv.
come on, guys.
I'm making it rain.
you see what you've done, liz lemon?
Tracy jordan is broken.
it's over.
get off stage! No whites!
you wanted to see me, miss maroney?
Oh, my. Candles, incense, disco music.
someone's getting into the easter spirit.
no, kenneth.
do you remember that silly joke about me having your baby?
Yes. So crazy. - I know.
it's crazy...
unless you're into it.
what?
no, ma'am. That would be wrong.
we're not married.
and we're different religions.
we can do whatever we want.
miss maroney, i'd do anything for you or Mr. Jordan, but this is wrong.
but, kenneth, you might be my only chance.
No!
fine. I'll get you when you're sleeping.
it's not rape if neither party really wants it.
you're back.
Yeah, and this is my front.
thanks for setting me up with another classic quote.
I borrowed your whale semen candle.
it didn't work, by the way.
you can keep it. I'm just packing up a few things, and then I'm gone.
wait. Where are you going?
I'm quitting show business.
I can't stop the horrible respect people have for me.
Tracy, you can't do that.
look, I would never say this on the record.
of course. This is all off the record.
the show needs you, and I need you.
I'd rather do the show than have a baby.
but you don't understand. - Oh, I do understand.
look at roman polanski. - No, thank you.
or elia kazan.
he told the government his friends were communists, then got a standing ovation at the oscars.
that's crazy.
a man named "elia." That's a giraffe's name.
who texted me earlier today.
shoot someone, huh?
Nah. That's crazy, even for us.
I guess it would take a pretty big gas leak to make you think that was a good idea.
all right! 100th episode, 100 hours of comedy.
minus the commercials. - 20 hours of comedy.
Hey, dummy. - Damn it.
look, liz, if this is gonna work out between you and me, you should know my tarantula sleeps on my face.
Oh, my god.
my show is getting cancelled, i'm never speaking to jack donaghy again, and the worst thing that happened to me today is that you showed up.
Ah,'cause you called me.
when I was high on gas.
do you not understand what that means?
no, not really. Gas has no effect on me at all.
when I was growing up, my school, gerry cooney elementary, it was right next to a gas works in queens.
it ventilated into the cafeteria.
we got a big settlement from the city.
our parents voted to spend it on a boat that the families could share, but then that sank.
but you know what?
I'm still smart enough to know that I'll never do better than you, liz lemon, 'cause you're a cook in the bedroom and a whore in the kitchen.
so I'm gonna give you one more shot to admit to me that you keep bringing me back into your life for a reason.
Subhas, take out the trash.
don't order me around, woman. - No, I mean- Just
Dennis, get out.
you'll change your mind.
let's rock, duffy.
wait, wait...
you - And I'm you. - Yeah, I get it.
do you?'cause it seems like you don't get much of anything anymore, old man.
if you're my future, i'm gonna jump.
stop him!
if he jumps, we don't exist anymore.
I'm perfectly aware of that.
I studied time dilation and quantum teleportation in college.
no, you didn't. You stime cop.
Really? I never saw time cop.
you will in 2007, and you'll love it.
why are you talking like that?
this is how everyone talked in the '80s.
this is how reagan talked.
look, there's still time to fix this, jack.
you need to kick ass again, starting with getting rid of that woman.
listen to him.
he's awesome, and you know he's right.
fire lemon?
I don't know if I can do that. - Well, then, take this!
Oh, god!
that only hurt me.
why did I think that would hurt you too?
Jack, be the man you were meant to be. me.
this tuxedo is made out of the puma that I rode into my 50th birthday party.
why are you both wearing tuxedos?
it's after 6: 00. What are we, farmers?
now go get rid of that woman.
just want to check everything out after your little gas scare.
well, my pen light is working. That's good.
now, can you say the alphabet for me?
excellent.
my god, jenna. Are you pregnant?
how? Did you go swimming in a public pool?
no, I got in my head about having a baby, and now I'm having a hysterical pregnancy.
well, that's redundant. All pregnancies are hysterical.
they're started by penises.
this should be perfect.
I mean, all I want is the attention.
so why am I not happy?
I mean, on some level, do I want to have a baby?
do I want to be a mother?
should I be a mother?
bored!
Hey. Greta johannsen, your animal wrangler.
my god, you're beautiful.
if you say good-bye tonight all I'll have will be my memories so keep on reaching for the light
I now believe these are my memories my memories
Mr. Jordan, I refuse to accept this is happening.
you leaving is as crazy to me as evolution, or a woman's right to choose her haircut.
I'm sorry, ken, but maybe jenna was right.
the only way I could come back is if I shoot someone, and that's crazy.
or is it? Maybe it's a good idea.
I don't know.
it has a nice, simple logic to it.
