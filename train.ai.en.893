about those handcuffs.
help me!
his name is Marcel Janvier. He is holding Kelvin Atley.
we need to get Atley back before he compromises our man in Tehran.
Cherokee.
do you play chess, Agent Callen?
a little. - My move.
he killed our people! Our people!
who's our mystery man? - Naseem Vaziri. He's Iranian.
what if Atley already told Janvier the name of the asset in Iran?
Cherokee gets compromised. And that's the price we pay.
no. No, this is not happening.
tough night?
I've had worse.
you owe Granger big-time for getting you out of jail.
shooting's officially under investigation.
you're... - Suspended. I know. They told me.
Hetty?
gone.
you don't need to be here.
we got company across the street.
not my problem. - Could be.
it's not really helping my case with you being here.
where should I be?
I don't want to talk about this.
was it worth it, G?
was it worth it? - Get out of my face!
where to? - Venice.
what are you doing here, Vaziri? - Excuse me?
what do you want from him?
sorry, I don't know what you're talking about. - The hell you do.
you stay away from him.
you done?
easy! Move!
against the van! - Back off.
relax. - Hands behind your back.
how long is this video?
uh, 34 seconds.
blurred faces are a nice touch. - It made the Net?
fraid so. I'm trying to stop the video going viral, but as soon as I pull it, another one pops up.
what about mainstream media?
they've agreed not to air the footage in the interest of national security.
all right, I'm going to have to write a kill program.
sorry, bad choice of words.
well, so it didn't take long for the word to get out that Hetty resigned.
half the LAPD already knows about it.
is Callen okay?
Yeah. He's fine.
with all due respect, sir, that's agency BS, and we all know it.
Cherokee was the CIA's man, not ours.
I understand but...
if that's what you need, sir.
I will.
Where's Atley? - Boatshed.
we haven't talked to him yet.
the agency wants their traitor back.
they've started a misinformation campaign to convince the Iranis that Atley's information was wrong, that Cherokee isn't a spy.
tehran contacted Vaziri overnight. They want independent confirmation.
Vaziri was waiting for Callen when he was released this morning.
Oh, and to top it off, Director Vance wants to know why one of his agents shot an unarmed man to death on national television.
you tell him? - Yeah.
the CIA's looking for someone to blame, Sam.
suddenly this whole thing is our fault.
they want Callen's head on a spear, and if we don't deliver... SECNAV's gonna shut us down.
I don't know how much longer I can hold them off.
you're a popular guy, Atley.
a lot of people want to talk to you.
NSA, Pentagon, FBI, State Department, not to mention the CIA.
those guys really, really, really want to talk to you.
so you tell us what you know, you don't have to talk to them.
I want indemnity from prosecution.
Wow. He doesn't get it, does he?
no. Oh, I don't think he does.
how long do you think you can hold your breath underwater, Kelvin?
you wouldn't do that.
no. We wouldn't do that, but the CIA...
I only gave the Iranians Cherokee's name and that's all.
didn't give them the file.
what file?
it's my insurance policy.
Yeah, I'd say this is a pretty good time to cash in your insurance policy, Kelvin.
I want indemnity.
we tried. - We definitely did try.
send them in.
wait.
I downloaded all the encrypted communications between Cherokee and Langley.
it proves Cherokee was spying for the CIA.
it also lists the names of every informant who's ever worked covertly for the U. S. in Iran.
what you might call a...
smoking gun for Tehran.
international incident for the U. S.
Where's this file now?
safety-deposit box here in L. A.
who else knows about it?
Janvier tried to make me give him the key.
told him he wouldn't get it till I got paid.
I guess that didn't really work out.
Where's the key?
luggage locker, Union Station.
locker number?
thank you.
and the Iranians. - What?
they know about the file, too.
you're not thinking of sailing this anywhere, are you?
the Atlantic.
with them? - No!
alone.
I hope you haven't come to talk me out of anything, Owen.
last time I saw this boat, she'd just been impounded by the Brits at Gibraltar.
this is a yacht, not a boat, and you haven't answered my question.
when's the last time I talked you out of anything, Henrietta?
any news of Mr. Callen?
he was released this morning. I haven't seen him.
you shouldn't have come.
I thought you should know, Iran is paranoid that they've been set up by the CIA.
something Langley's actively encouraging them to believe.
tehran's asked Vaziri to confirm that Cherokee really is a CIA spy.
so...
you need to be careful, Henrietta.
screw Washington, Tehran, the whole spy game.
I'm not going to defend the agency or anybody else, for that matter.
they're all responsible for making this mess.
and if you've got that letter in your jacket, you hang on to it, Owen.
get the hell off my yacht.
go on!
some days we appreciate our freedom more than others, wouldn't you agree?
forgive me.
my name is... - Naseem Vaziri.
I know who you are.
then you know we have a mutual acquaintance.
or we did.
until you killed him.
I'm intrigued, Agent Callen.
why you would do such a thing?
Janvier must have found your weakness.
got nothing to say to you.
just listen, then.
Janvier and I were engaged in a business transaction.
he was going to give me a file.
I'm not Atley.
Atley had a price.
Janvier had a price.
we all have a price.
I just need to find out what's yours.
Atley's bank of choice.
we got this from the bank's exterior security cameras.
this car is registered to one of Vaziri's companies.
Ah, a little Iranian reception party for anybody that comes to collect Atley's file from the safety-deposit box.
could've paid one of the bank employees to, uh, tip them off.
we need to secure that file before the Iranians or else.
or else what?
work up a plan. Keep me updated.
or else what?
or else we'll all gonna be looking for another job.
salaam, Henrietta.
reports
death can have its advantages.
I remember the last time I saw you in Tehran, the revolutionary students were dragging you off to prison.
to teach me the error of my ways.
I was a good student.
I denounced the Shah and embraced the revolution.
never too late to change sides.
in our line of work, it's always an option.
and you.
all these rumors.
such a shame they cast you aside like this.
there are too many bureaucrats, Hosein.
the game has changed.
and it seems as if we're all working for the CIA these days.
surely not you, Henrietta?
well, I-I never was one to do what was expected of me.
this latest CIA operation...
the one man who knows the truth about this mess has been thrown out of NCIS on his ass and will probably wind up in prison for killing a man who deserved it.
agent Callen.
I've said too much.
perhaps we could speak some more over tea?
perhaps not.
I have a car.
so have I.
some other time...
you can come out now, Mr. Hanna.
I never did trust that bastard.
they sent someone from your past.
I should have killed him back then when I had the chance.
I'm perfectly capable of looking after myself, Mr. Hanna.
I was just passing.
Langley's breathing down Granger's neck.
looking for someone to blame.
not unexpected.
it gets worse.
if we don't retrieve that file,
SECNAV's closing down the unit.
how's Mr. Callen?
he says he's fine.
but you and I know otherwise.
one day it catches up with all of us.
if you're lucky, someone else dies and you get to walk away.
go home, Sam.
Mr. Callen and I are on our own.
and if I need to find you?
nearest bar.
scotch on the rocks. - You got it.
were you followed?
no, but you were.
Vaziri and another guy.
bald, gray beard, tan jacket.
his name's Hosein Khadem.
he's trying to intimidate me.
is it working?
just ignore them.
how's retirement?
I could die of boredom...
...if someone doesn't shoot me first.
how was your day, Mr. Callen?
I went for a swim.
when I got out, Vaziri was holding my towel.
tehran's paranoid that they caught the wrong spy.
Vaziri's looking to confirm that Atley's given them the right name.
evidently, Atley has a file with the names of other dissidents.
Vaziri paid you a call today, too? - No, not Vaziri.
Khadem.
how do you know this guy?
Khadem was Savak,
iranian Secret Police under the Shah.
when Khomeini came to power, he changed sides.
he went from being my ally to my enemy overnight.
betrayed dozens of good men, their families.
many of them my friends.
Khadem's my Janvier.
you'd shoot him in cold blood?
that would be murder, Mr. Callen.
so, you're just going to wait for him to make the first move?
do I have a choice?
no.
but I do.
might as well add treason to my arrest warrant.
Mr. Callen.
you want my price? It's her.
you keep him away from her, you'll get what you want.
I want Atley's file.
you know I can't deliver that.
then confirm the name of your spy in Tehran.
Cherokee.
you know him as General Sanjar Esfahani.
you just got yourself a CIA spy.
you stay away from her.
of course.
everybody, listen up.
NSA intercepted a phone call between Vaziri and Tehran overnight.
Vaziri told Tehran that an NCIS agent confirmed Cherokee's identity.
the CIA is demanding Callen's immediate arrest.
are we going to comply?
since when do we work for the CIA? - No way we're doing this.
look, we don't have a say in this.
the call came directly from SECNAV
you want to help Callen, you want to help us, get Atley's file, make sure it gets into the right hands.
we're gonna have one shot at this.
let's make it count.
you think this plan's gonna work?
it's gotta work.
Nell, talk to legal.
we're going to need an arrest warrant for Agent Callen.
so, what are the charges exactly, treason or murder?
both.
right.
okay, we've got a visual and comms.
just arriving at the bank.
Kensi and Deeks are out of the car, Eric.
looks like our Iranian friends are still here.
SUV on the right.
this could get interesting.
I like interesting.
if it's gonna happen, it'll be when you come out.
be ready.
you got everything?
Yes, Mom.
status please, Eric.
they've collected the safety-deposit box key from the luggage locker.
just arrived at the bank.
the Iranians? - Front and center.
I counted two in the SUV.
could be more.
you think we're on their radar?
in this suit, are you kidding me?
probably haven't taken their eyes off me since I got out of the car.
or it could be... yeah, it's probably you.
I'm just saying that skirt is working.
they've entered the bank.
I got 'em, Sam.
morning. - Good morning.
welcome to Certified National. How can we be of service today?
I need access a safety-deposit box.
certainly. Name?
and away we go.
first name? - Scott.
this is your safety-deposit box or... - My husband's.
but you have his signed authorization to access the box?
I'm his wife.
I'm sorry, but you either need to be designated or have a signed authorization.
okay, listen, honey, he's my husband, okay?
what's his is mine, what's mine, oh, he's welcome to, because I don't have a damn safety-deposit box, do I?
morning.
I am, uh, Kelvin Atley.
I need to access my safety-deposit box, please.
of course, Mr. Atley. - Mrs. Peters, there's no need to raise your voice.
I'm sure if you just ask your husband...
you want me to talk to my cheating, lying, good-for-nothing, two-faced cheap husband?
this is what you want? Start World War III? - I'm sorry.
I didn't think so.
you're sorry. Okay.
okay, you know what? If I can't have access to that box, you are going to open it and you're gonna tell me how much money he's got stashed in there.
that's what you're gonna do, honey.
sign right here. - Of course.
even if I was authorized to, which I'm not, it's a two key system and I'd need your husband's key.
you want a key?
you want a key? I'll give you a damn key.
I just need to check your ID on file.
if we could do this quickly, I'm actually in a little bit of a hurry.
there you go. There you go.
Oh, freaking ridiculous.
I don't have a key. I don't have a key.
you know why? Because he's freaking stingy, that's why.
try not to get too upset here.
so, we're good then?
that stupid moron. Hmm? - Sir, good to go?
Yeah, um, just come with me this way. - See, I have no key.
I have no key. Do you know why?
because that floozy has that key.
that blonde floozy with highlights and short hair...
and we're in.
take all the time you need. - Thank you, sir.
I got a USB.
this must be the file. We good?
clear, you're good to go.
this is how you treat your customers? This is how you treat your customers?
are you enjoying yourself? Are you enjoying this? Are you?
are you? Really? - On the way out right now.
all right.
iranians are on the move.
someone in the bank must have tipped them off.
don't rush.
let 'em come.
okay, guys, they've got backup.
move to plan B. - I hate plan B.
go!
follow them!
Sam, you got to get down here.
let's go, let's go!
let's go!
leave it, leave it!
Yeah, no, I completely understand.
I'm just saying don't-don't try too hard.
Yeah, exactly.
okay, yeah, thanks, Mikey.
Yup, you, too.
well, Callen's arrest warrant just went out.
does anyone know where he is? - Good luck trying to find him.
Eric have any luck tracing that car?
all the way to Santa Monica, then they lost it.
they're doing a kaleidoscope search.
okay, all right. Well, we know we got two, right?
and I think I winged one, so why doesn't Nell just check the local ERs?
it's out of our hands; we gave it our best shot.
did we?
ops. Now.
something's going down in Tehran.
NSA picked up a major spike in telecommunications traffic.
most of it's internal
intelligence agencies, key government ministers, the military.
NSA intercepted a burst transmission from Vaziri to Tehran an hour after they received Atley's USB.
15 minutes later, they're in meltdown.
guess they didn't like what was in the file.
and Vaziri just received an encrypted e-mail from Tehran 30 minutes ago.
NSA's still decrypting it.
okay, we need to see that, Eric.
well, that would require us looking over their shoulder while they decrypt it, which isn't the normal level of access they allow.
hell with what they allow; just do it.
just doing it.
okay, hacking the NSA.
and... we're in.
does anyone speak Farsi? - Hetty does.
good point.
I'm rusty.
something about...
conflicting information...
use all necessary measures.
reconfirming conflicting information that was given to them.
given to them by Atley?
operative.
Vaziri's going back to Callen to confirm what he told them.
and use all necessary measures.
wait.
that's an order, Agent Hanna.
Eric. - Calling Agent Callen.
no answer. - Phone turned off?
dead.
Vaziri got the message 30 minutes ago, Sam.
it's too late.
tell me the identity of the CIA spy in Tehran.
Cherokee.
and Cherokee's real name?
I told you last night in the bar.
tell me again.
general... Sanjar Esfahani.
general Esfahani denies it.
well, wouldn't you?
tell me what you know about Atley.
was an NSA analyst.
he turned traitor.
he knew the CIA had a spy in Tehran code-named Cherokee.
he offered the information to Janvier.
Janvier sold the information to you.
you asked for confirmation; I gave you confirmation.
general Sanjar Esfahani is Cherokee.
you're not telling me the truth. - There's no other truth.
tehran believes otherwise.
they have Atley's file. There are, shall we say, discrepancies.
you there?
start the camera.
yesterday... you asked me for her life.
I gave you the truth-- there's no mistake.
I gave you the name; you gave them their spy.
kill her.
wait!
wait! Tell him to wait!
the truth. - Tell him to wait!
call him off! Call him off!
stand down, Khadem.
Khadem, can you hear me?
Khadem, can you hear me?!
I said, stand down, Khadem.
can you hear me?!
I hear you, Naseem.
if I don't like your version of the truth, she dies.
it's a lie. - What's a lie?
everything.
Cherokee.
there was no spy in Tehran.
this whole operation was put together by the CIA to convince you there was.
Why?
to eliminate the one man the CIA fears in Tehran more than anyone.
why would they fear him?
because he can't be bought.
he's an extremist who is loyal to the clergy and the military.
but they knew that if you thought he was a spy, you'd have him arrested.
you'd have him executed for treason.
but they knew they had to convince you first.
gave Esfahani's name to Janvier.
they figured if you had to pay more for the information, you'd be more willing to believe it.
lies!
I saw you shoot Janvier.
an arrest warrant has been issued for you for his murder!
who?
who?!
it's time to go.
go where? - For a ride.
no bulletproof vest this time?
put this on.
Why?
when you're in our protection, you wear a vest.
no exceptions.
okay.
no vest.
we're not planning to shoot you this time.
why would you stage Janvier's murder?
so you'd believe I had nothing to lose.
a disgraced agent... under investigation.
someone you could get to.
someone you could buy off to confirm Atley's information.
my leg still hurts.
good.
where are you taking me?
road trip.
tehran's going to want someone to pay for this.
better it not be you.
but you got to give them something.
the $50 million they paid for the information...
and the man they gave it to. - Go on.
you stay away from Henrietta Lange, call off Khadem.
And?
a trade.
me for Janvier.
what is this?
you're no longer our problem.
we're letting you go.
I hear the weather's great in Tehran this time of year.
checkmate.
I hope you haven't moved my things, Owen.
I'm not that crazy.
you know, you don't have to keep changing the dates.
you could just print up a new one each time.
just a thought.
shall we have an operational debrief?
sure.
Cherokee's been released.
he got a promotion for his troubles.
he's been put in charge of counterintelligence.
his specific brief is to protect the Tehran government from foreign spies.
and the agency?
well, they're relieved they still have a man in Tehran.
of course, they want a full report.
they want to know exactly when we worked up this audacious plan, and why we didn't include them in it.
we are out of time, Agent Callen!
and we don't have another plan!
I'm sorry, Mr. Callen.
I'm sorry.
no.
there's got to be something we can do.
maybe there is.
do you want to share, Henrietta?
to make people believe it, I think I'm going to have to resign.
and you, Mr. Callen, are going to have to shoot Janvier.
maybe you could tell them we just worked it out over a cup of tea.
what did you replace Atley's file with?
Deeks switched the USBs at the bank, but Eric had changed one file, Operation Cherokee.
then it was just a matter of making sure it fell into Iranian hands.
leave it! Leave it!
we were lucky, Henrietta.
fortune favors the brave, Owen.
Hey, Callen.
morning, G.
Hey, Pete, not so tight on the cuffs next time, all right?
put the gun down! - Lower your weapon!
you owe us a drink. - Done.
what's Mr. Callen's undercover status?
he's operational.
Eric minimized his exposure.
and Vaziri?
when the dust settles, we'll take him down.
there's no hurry.
but there is one thing.
a body washed up at the Marina this morning.
he'd been shot.
I guess he and Vaziri had a falling out.
would you like to join me for a cup of tea, Owen?
or would you prefer something a little stronger?
get the hell off me!
get up! Stand up!
stand up. Stand up. Stand up.
come on! Let go of me! Stand up!
I don't care how you do it.
issue a shipwide announcement if you have to. Just find him.
aye, Master Chief.
officer on deck.
as you were. - With me, Chief.
I understand we had a situation in the Enlisted Galley this morning.
I'm sure they were just letting off a little steam, sir.
the crew's probably a little stressed from the extended mission.
Oh, you and I both know that's no excuse, Master Chief.
if they're stressed now, what the hell are they going to be like in a combat situation?
I want to read the NCIS report.
that makes two of us, sir.
we still can't find the Special Agent Afloat.
find him.
would NCIS Special Agent Afloat Niles please contact the watch commander?
what's wrong with your hat?
I don't get it.
Hetty, I-I can explain. Uh...
actually, no, this is my fault.
I asked Eric to help me out with the Toys for Tots program I'm doing for the Marine Corps, and, well, I thought it would be fun for the kids if we were dressed up.
Yes. It sounds wonderful.
but I'm afraid it'll have to wait.
we've lost one of our own.
rally the troops.
Mr. Beale?
you have, um, elf head.
so, Christmas is less than a week away.
one of the very few holidays we get off, if we're lucky.
and you have no plans? - Nope.
swear? - Yes.
perfect.
no. - Yes!
no, no, nono, because I have chosen not to do anything.
it was not by default.
I have made a conscious choice not to do anything on Christmas.
also known as step one to become the crazy lady with 30 cats.
Kensi, think about this. Lake Tahoe. Ski-in, ski-out cabin.
six feet of fresh powder.
snowboarding during day, roaring fire at night.
I don't think so. - Do you suck?
excuse me? - At snowboarding?
just know it takes a lot of coordination.
maybe we could get you, like, a toboggan.
I can snowboard. - They have a bunny hill.
I don't need a bunny hill. - What are you so afraid of?
I'm not afraid of anything. I could kick your ass anytime, anywhere.
this... double-black-diamond rated.
there is no doubt in my mind that that is double-black-diamond rated.
Plus, I told my mom I'd spend Christmas with her.
well, then, she should come. It's a three-bedroom cabin. Two of which are connected.
don't even think about it. - For your mom.
and you, so you guys could have adjoining rooms. What are you thinking?
nothing. - I bet you were.
it might actually be nice to give my mom a little vacation.
and what's better than a white Christmas?
just the three of us, hanging out...
sipping hot cocoa, watching the snow fall on the cedars.
from the hot tub.
Oh! You had to go there.
what? She's a stone-cold fox. - You ruined it!
I didn't. I made it better. Didn't I, Nell?
Hetty needs you guys up in OPS.
great.
Hetty needs you guys up in OPS.
okay, we'll be right there. - Can I help you with something?
you could, if he knew what he was looking for or where he put it.
so I asked my daughter what she wanted for Christmas in June, and then I went out to buy it right away.
he hid it so she wouldn't find it.
of course, as we know, the memory is the first to go.
I think it had something to do with Harry Potter.
a wand? - No.
how about an owl? - No.
no? - A sorting hat?
a what? - A broom?
you're not helping. - Eh, I'm not really trying.
who we looking at, Eric?
Jason Niles was the NCIS Special Agent Afloat on the USS Van Buren.
he was discovered dead yesterday.
cause of death was blunt force trauma, either from a fall or a deliberate bludgeoning.
any witnesses? - No.
suspects? - Possibly one.
petty Officer Simon Allen is an intelligence specialist.
now, according to Agent Niles's last report, he was keeping an eye on Petty Officer Allen for "erratic behavior.
what does that mean?
well, he doesn't specify in his log but Petty Officer Allen is currently in the brig following an altercation with a Marine staff sergeant on the same morning that the body was found.
what were they fighting about?
not sure. But both men tested positive for cocaine use.
Where's the Van Buren now?
it's on its way to the Sea of Japan to keep North Korea in line.
so then, what are we supposed to do?
what you do best.
solve the crime.
I've already arranged for you all to be flown out to the ship.
Christmas is going to have to wait.
Hello, sailor.
I'm a Marine major. - You're a major hotty.
Oh. Those are some cool costumes.
uniform. They're not costumes, Deeks.
we're going in as crew members, and Callen's going in as the replacement for the NCIS Agent Afloat.
Mm-hmm. So what's my cover?
you, my friend, are a civilian contractor doing a computer upgrade.
a geek? This is all I get? This, like, clipboard?
there are over 5, 000 people on board.
going in as different elements of the crew will allow us to cover more ground.
Mm-hmm. Just for the record, this is a gross misuse of my undercover talents.
well, if you truly feel that way, Mr. Deeks, you can go in as a Marine, as well.
just let me get my clippers. - All right.
what? Clippers?
Ooh, you're gonna look so good with a high and tight.
no, no. No, no, no, no, wait.
just got to do a little, uh, sense memory work for my undercover character, you know.
red leather, yellow leather. Red leather, yellow leather. Acting, ha!
chopper's here to take us to Coronado.
I know that look.
you're starting to sound like my wife.
you know what they say when your partner starts sounding like your wife?
get a new wife?
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.
see, that's the problem right there. You and I don't talk.
communication goes, the relationship is soon to follow.
almost finished? - Just about.
look, I know you want to be home for Christmas.
I've missed Christmas, graduations, birthdays and everything else doing what we do.
then what is it?
what if he comes back while we're away?
then Michelle will do what she has to do.
same is if you were here.
Yeah. But I won't be.
then we'll make this quick.
besides, I guarantee you, Sidirov isn't showing up here anytime soon.
how can you be so sure?
criminals take Christmas off just like the rest of us.
even the bad guys don't like being on the naughty list.
the Navy has a budget of $155 billion, and this is the plane that they use?
c2 Greyhound-- workhorse of the sea.
Mm-hmm. Yeah, well, this horse needs to be sent to the glue factory.
it's probably the safest plane you'll ever fly in.
th-this is the safe... Really?
okay, explain to me, then, why we're wearing helmets and life preservers.
correct me if I'm wrong, but the only time to wear a life preserver is in the event of a water landing.
so tell me, do they know something that we don't know?
there is nothing to be afraid of, Deeks.
what? I'm not. I have hardened nerves of steel.
I just think it's a little disconcerting the back of the plane opens like my garage door.
it's like a flying tool shed.
Deeks? - Yeah?
I'm trying to sleep here. - Okay.
well, I'll be sure to wake you up when we crash into the ocean.
Hey, just try and relax, Maverick.
huh? Did you hear that?
I look a little Top Gun in this thing, don't I?
trying to find anyone who might have a grudge against Special Agent Niles.
that sounds good.
you okay? - Oh, yeah, I'm fine.
it's just...
I was really looking forward to the holiday party and the Secret Santa stuff.
it's... it's stupid.
I don't think so.
I'm so... I just get like this around the holidays.
cause I... I can't be home.
and it's like these people we work with, they become...
our surrogate family, and they're not here right now.
they'll be back soon.
and you know what, even if they're not,
I promise that we will have a festive holiday celebration.
I mean, I've agreed to wear an elf hat, so...
and the ears? - I'm sorry, the what?
you have to wear the elf ears.
um, I don't think I remember you saying anything about any...
Oh, come on.
Hey, what's an elf without ears, right?
exactly.
prepare for landing.
piece of cake! I don't know what you guys were so worried about.
welcome aboard the USS Van Buren, ma'am, sirs.
I'm Petty Officer Smalls.
can I point you in the right direction, Commander?
no, I'm good, thanks.
special Agent Callen, would you like to be taken to the NCIS office?
actually, I'm headed to the brig first, but can find my way. Thanks.
you must be Mr. Colter, the data entry systems analyst.
well, you say "day-ta," I say data
I say we split the difference and call it a date.
I'm the ship's civilian personnel liaison. I'll be your escort.
someone should be here to meet you momentarily, ma'am.
thank you. - Fantastic.
I don't know if you, uh, overheard that, but I have a, uh, escort.
fraternization is forbidden on board, Deeks.
wow, jealous much?
major Barret?
please excuse my tardiness, ma'am. I'm Lieutenant Abernathy. Welcome aboard.
thank you, Lieutenant.
if you'll follow me, I'll show you to your berthing.
you can get squared away before you muster on station.
Yes.
so what, they found the missing link.
are you coming, Mr. Colter?
Oh. Colter, no. Please call me Marty.
and I should call you...? - Petty Officer Smalls will suffice, sir.
all right.
so, what were you and Staff Sergeant Jefferies fighting about?
I don't know, sir. It was stupid.
I mean, you know what the Marines are like. "Oorah" this and "oorah" that.
sometimes it just gets a little tiresome and you have to stand up to them or else they walk around like they own the place.
you two have a history?
absolutely not, sir. I couldn't pick him out of a lineup.
he and his boys were lipping off, so I told them to shut it.
next think you know, he's tackling me.
guess he figured he had something to prove.
did this fight have anything to do with cocaine?
I can't speak for Petty Officer Allen, but I did not, nor have I ever used cocaine.
then how do you explain your drug test?
it must be a mistake, sir. I'd gladly be retested.
Oh, so you test negative now that it's out of your system?
it was never in my system, sir.
I'm no angel, Agent Callen, but I'll take a lie detector to prove I'm no drug user.
my father and my uncle were Marines.
I would never disrespect this uniform, this ship or my family by doing something so stupid.
what's your relationship with the NCIS Special Agent Afloat Jason Niles?
I never even knew who he was until I heard he was reported dead.
Yeah, I-I only met him once.
he intervened in an argument I was having a few days ago.
what was the argument about?
it was music. Some E3 was in the library listening to music with his headphones, but he had the tunes cranked so loud, it was bugging everybody.
where were you yesterday prior to the... altercation in the galley?
fire safety drills.
I had the morning watch.
which ends at 8: 00? - Yes, sir.
the fight took place just after 9: 00, so what were you doing for the hour in-between?
uh, usually I would jog around the deck, but flight operations were in full swing, so I just walked below deck.
why didn't you use the treadmills in the gym?
I always feel like a hamster on those things, sir.
anyone see you?
uh, yeah, sure, lots of people.
anyone see you around the...
zero-two-tack- one-eight-two-tack-six-tango section of the ship?
I-I can't be sure, sir. Where exactly is that?
where the body was found.
the bull's-eyes tell you where you are
deck, frame, relation to centerline and compartment.
numbers increase as you go aft.
even numbers are port, odd numbers are starboard.
Starbucks? - S-Starboard.
no, I mean, is there a Starbucks on board?
or a Coffee Bean? Panda Express? T.G.I. Fridays? Froyo?
enlisted Mess is on the second level.
the Dirty Shirt Room, Wardroom One, is forward on the O3 level.
chief's Mess has the best food, but you have to be invited.
if you'll follow me this way, Mr. Colter...
Mr. Colter? Hello?
what's up there, sailors? Nothing to see here.
what the... what?
what the hell are you doing?
me? No. I was just...
I was just looking for the bathroom.
I got lost coming around one of these corners.
I found myself in the basement of the Titanic.
seriously, I think I just saw Kate Winslet.
she was naked. You should check it... out.
Hey, I see how this is-- you guys, uh, want to haze the swabbie.
here's the problem-- I'm a private contractor, which means you can't dress me up like a sea hag, or whatever it is you and your seaman buddy here do for fun.
what the hell is going on in here?
he was creeping around where we found that NCIS agent dead, sir.
sir, you know what they say about criminals, always returning to the scene of the crime.
Yeah, except for Matlock, I'm pretty sure no one actually says that.
I'll take him from here.
they're gone. - I just need...
come on, Deeks, pull your skirt down-- I hardly hit you.
I know, I was... I was just in character. It's fine. I'm fine.
you've been on the ship less than an hour, and you're already in trouble.
Yeah, I know, but I found evidence.
special Agent Niles was killed on a different part of the ship, and then his body was dragged here.
these are the sailors who attacked Deeks.
both men have had minor incidents while on shore leave, but both occurred before Agent Niles was assigned to their vessel.
does either man have a connection with Special Agent Niles?
nothing we've found so far. Neither one was noted in any of Niles' files.
however, one of the men, Petty Officer Lambert, worked in Intelligence with Petty Officer Allen.
all right. See if there's any other dots to connect.
on it.
so Deeks thinks Special Agent Niles was killed elsewhere on the ship and then dumped where his body was found.
the body showed signs of massive blunt-force trauma with a distinctive wound pattern, but there is nothing in the area where we found him that would account for that sort of injury.
well, it could've been done by the weapon the killer used or some other piece of equipment he had on.
except for the fact... that I found this. - What is it?
that, my friend, is spinach, or Swiss chard, possibly kale
but I think it's spinach because I nibbled it a little bit and it tasted like spinach.
let me see that. - It's called detective work, boys.
Yeah, I see where you're going with this.
Popeye ate spinach, Popeye was a sailor, so...
we're looking for a crew member with giant forearms, smoking a pipe.
why, I oughta...
it could've come off anyone's shoe. Could' fallen out of the trash.
that's true, except for-- wait for it-- this.
wardroom, messes. This... is where we found the body.
it's the other side of the ship. - Uh-huh, exactly.
so if you think about all the passageways and the ladders, it would be almost impossible for this to get from one side of the ship to the other...
without being scraped off somebody's boot.
it would be improbable, but not impossible.
what's impossible is to kill somebody in the galley, then drag the corpse through the entire ship without being seen.
Mm-hmm. How do you account for that?
I don't have to account for that-- I'm the one that found the spinach.
What'd you guys find, huh? More importantly, what did Kensi find?
Oh. Kensi found something.
Yeah. Six-two and looks like a male model.
that's right.
what? That guy? That guy's not her type.
he's a Marine. Really?
her father was a Marine. - Girls love their daddies.
Yep. - Oorah.
okay. Good talk.
do you know Staff Sergeant Jefferies? He's serving aboard.
I know of him, ma'am. Why?
Oh, we're just from the same hometown and have mutual family friends.
I was hoping to say hello. But, uh, I hear he's in the brig.
I think he and one of the crew got into a scuffle.
that doesn't sound like the Jefferies I remember.
I'm sure it was nothing serious, ma'am.
by the end of a long deployment everybody's ready to get off this ship, and having our mission suddenly extended seemed to shorten everyone's fuse.
master Chief! Master Chief.
let's talk about this!
I need a security force to the ready room.
come on!
down!
I need a security force down here!
don't touch that! It's evidence! Don't touch it!
the lab tested it. No signs of Niles' hair, blood, DNA, nothing.
they could've wiped it clean.
Yeah, it also doesn't match his head wound.
how's the master chief doing? - Still a little out of it.
what the hell happened?
the senior medical officer believes that his altered mental state was caused by... cocaine toxicity.
you're way out of line, Mr. Callen.
it's "Special Agent Callen
I've known the master chief for years. I'll take his word over yours any day.
how about the word of your chief medical officer?
drug tests don't lie.
no, but they can be wrong.
then how do you explain your master chief attacking crew members with a wrench?!
with all due respect, sir, your ship has a serious drug problem.
Oh, so first you try and tell me I got a killer on board, and now a bunch of drug addicts.
I'm not trying to tell you anything. The evidence...
agent Niles could have fallen down and hit his head, for all I know!
all you have are allegations, and if you're gonna keep making 'em, you sure as hell better have something to back 'em up.
aircraft carrier is one of the most dangerous places on the planet, especially if you're careless or stupid.
now, you seem relatively smart for a civilian, so I'd suggest you be careful.
sorry I'm late; I got hung up.
how'd you make out with the XO?
not as well as I'd hoped-- he basically threatened me.
you think he's involved?
Nah, I doubt it. Can't blame the XO for his behavior.
everyone on board is a reflection on him. His career's on the line.
somebody smuggled the drugs on board and is now dealing.
NCIS Agent Afloat Niles obviously came close to finding out who that is, and it got him killed.
it sounds like we got to lean on those that tested positive.
both of them denied using. - Well, they usually do.
we need to search the ship.
you want to search this? That's like searching Cleveland. This place is huge.
I didn't say it would be easy.
but the act alone might force whoever's behind this to get nervous and make a mistake.
okay. I'll ask to be assigned to the security search force.
I'll keep digging through the 4, 000-plus crew.
if I let those in custody think we're getting close to finding the source, they may start talking to cut a deal first.
I'll keep working my lead. - What's your lead?
funny you should ask. - What's this?
that right there is a little trace evidence I found at the crime scene.
spinach. - Or as I like to call it,"forensic botany.
no, it's called spinach. - Whatever.
it's difficult to stay in touch on the ship, so it's gonna be extra hard to cover each other's back.
let's be extra careful. We already lost one NCIS agent.
I'm gonna need you to level with me, Lieutenant.
is drug use a common problem on this ship?
not that I'm aware of, Major.
the skipper runs a tight ship, and dope's a serious violation.
well, how hard can it be to sneak a little cocaine onto a ship this size?
we only do random searches around the clock, especially on those people returning from liberty.
okay. How would you explain what's happening?
wish I had an answer, Major, especially for the master chief.
he's probably one of the most squared-away sailors I've ever met.
what is it, Lieutenant?
nothing, ma'am.
I told you to level with me-- that's an order.
I did, ma'am.
if you're hiding something from me...
I-I'm not, ma'am, it's just...
please, uh, don't take this the wrong way, Major, but you don't seem like a very...
I mean, you do, and you don't, and I am just way out of line-- I'm sorry.
relax.
watch your head, sir. - Yeah, that's, uh...
why they call it "forewarning" there, Smalls.
these really necessary, sir?
you tell me.
first rule of behavioral analysis is that the best predictor of future violence is past violence.
you have no history of violence. Care to explain?
I've always taken full responsibility for my actions and those who serve under me.
but I got to be honest with you, sir.
I have no idea what happened.
medical report says it was a cocaine-induced psychosis.
that's-that's just not possible, sir.
you sure about that, Master Chief?
because if it wasn't the drugs, how do you explain attacking several crew members and two officers with a wrench?
I can't.
you trying to silence your dealer before we found him out?
no.
let me see your arms.
put your head back.
you can check between my toes, my gums, anywhere you like, you're not gonna find anything.
I have to set an example for the men and women on this ship, and I do.
I don't drink, I don't smoke, and I don't do drugs.
hell, I don't even eat red meat.
do you have any enemies on this ship?
I'd like to think not.
the average age of the crew member on this ship is 19 years old.
it's my job to help train them to operate the most powerful weapon in the world.
that takes discipline and responsibility.
and yes... sometimes there is friction.
it's a little early for Secret Santa, isn't it?
open it.
okay.
no. No, no.
this was not part of our deal.
you never said anything about... panty hose.
okay, they're leggings, not panty hose, and it's part of your costume.
what it is, is a death sentence if Callen, Sam or Deeks ever saw me wearing them.
it's gonna be fun. - Wha... No.
I am all for helping children, but...
I'm sorry, I cannot do this. I can't do it. I'm sorry.
you wear polar bear and Spiderman pajamas.
Spiderman is cool, and polar bear... It's different, okay?
I-I wear those in the privacy of my own home.
people are going to see me in this.
there will be kids and the taking of pictures, and next thing I know it'll be on Facebook, and then...
and then... and then a video on YouTube, then it goes viral, then they stat playing it on a loop on the big screen, and, oh, my God, Sam is calling me Elfie McBeal...
okay, you know what? You don't have to wear it.
forget it.
Wai...
what now?
two pilots were scrubbed from flight operations this morning...due to "illness
cocaine? - Haven't heard yet, but the scuttlebutt around the ship is that flight operations might be suspended.
you get anything from the chief?
nothing but denial.
I got to say, I believe him.
this guy's service record's cleaner than yours or mine.
well... definitely mine.
you think a disgruntled sailor could be trying to set him up?
possibly. Doesn't explain the pilots.
uncle Sam spends millions to train these guys.
they bust their asses to get a chance to do this.
they're the best of the best.
everyone I've questioned has been exemplary.
and none of them have asked for a JAG lawyer.
they all seem more concerned about their careers than anything else.
exactly like the XO.
not what you would expect from someone who knows they're guilty.
Nope.
do you think someone could have unknowingly drugged them?
could they be trying to sabotage the ship and her mission?
the flight operations are grounded-- they've already succeeded.
there's something else.
I can't reach my wife.
...safety team to the ordnance elevator.
on the double.
well, ahoy, mateys. - Can we help you?
Yeah, I'm just looking for the ship's stores.
well, you're looking at them.
thought you would've learned your lesson about snooping around.
keep it up, you're gonna end up in sickbay, like your buddy. What's that?
Oh, yeah, you guys didn't stick around long enough to see me kick his ass, did you?
hold on, guys, I don't know what's going on here, but if we don't get this thing up and going again, you're all gonna be eating salmonella salad.
Yeah, well, if the damn thing wouldn't keep breaking down, then we wouldn't have to keep fixing it.
what seems to be the problem?
no problem-- we just had a faulty refrigeration unit, that's all.
they flew another one in.
Uh-huh. I think I shared a seat with it. All right, well, listen,
I'm gonna take a look around if nobody has a problem with that.
you two? Show of hands? Okay.
looks like we got it: Colonel Mustard, on the ship...
...with a pipe valve.
wow, wouldn't want my head smashed into that.
how long does it take Eric to send a damn car to my house?
maybe she wasn't home? - Then, where is she?
if Sidirov was back in the country, we would know.
the minute he contacts Michelle, bells go off with us and the CIA.
guys. - You find her?
not yet, but initial forensics suggest we got a match.
match for what? - The photo that Deeks sent.
it matches the head wound that killed Agent Niles.
Deeks found the murder weapon?
looks that way. Some sort of pipe valve.
where?
I don't know. He hasn't answered my last few e-mails.
if Deeks found the murder site, he could have found the thing that got Agent Niles killed.
can you determine where on the ship the photos were taken?
it'll be tough since the paint schematics are uniform throughout the ship, but I'll cross-reference with the plumbing schematics, see what I find.
alert Kensi, you call us, you find anything else.
got it.
if you wanted to poison the crew, you only have a few options:
air, water, food, or some sort of surface contact.
if Deeks was following up on his spinach clue, he was probably snooping around the food stores on the ship.
nobody knows the ship better than the command master chief.
he could pinpoint the location.
all right, I'll show him the photo. You find Kens.
open it. - Sir.
you know where this is?
it's a main steam valve. They're all over the ship.
in food stores? - Yes, sir.
show me.
Sam - You got this? - Yes, ma'am.
make way! Coming through!
Hey, what the hell's going on?
Deeks found the murder weapon, but now we can't reach him.
would Commander Hanna and Major Barret please report to zero-two-tack-one-four-four-tack-seven-Lima compartment?
this way.
is this what you're looking for?
it's consistent with the photos of the victim's wounds.
Callen? Did you find him?
no, but I think we're in the right spot.
you boys see the guy you were beating up on yesterday?
the guy who kicked your ass, sir? - He what?
do you see where he went?
he was snooping around here a few minutes ago.
Hey, hold up a second.
yo, with the trash!
go, go! I got it. I got it. I got it.
federal agents! - Deeks...
shooter's down, G.
like that little bank shot, huh?
little eight ball, corner pocket?
Yeah, I taught you that. - You didn't teach me that.
I definitely taught you that. You say my memory's going.
I know it's needless to say, but I'm gonna say it anyway. Thank you.
couldn't let him throw away a perfectly good partner.
did you get him? - Yep.
is he talking? - Not so much; he's dead.
master Chief, could you secure the body?
Yes, sir. You here and you with me. Come on.
okay, so we know where they killed Agent Niles, but still no drugs.
K-9s already searched that area.
maybe they were sabotaging the refrigeration unit so the food would spoil, you know?
the smell would throw off the dogs.
it's not that easy.
fresh paint.
what? - It's in the paint? Wow, they're good.
you got to be kidding me. They're really good.
damn. - Sam?
it's Michelle.
everything all right?
she was at a friend's house finishing up costumes for the kids' play.
totally forgot about the Christmas pageant.
What'd I tell you? - You said she'd be all right.
I also said the memory is the first to go.
I said it.
Leonard Wall is a produce supplier
he could afford to lose money on the produce because he was using the Navy to transport his drugs.
the ship's lab confirmed that the paint in the container was, like, a highly concentrated cocaine - hydrochloride mixture.
drug dogs can't smell it. - Yeah, it was a pretty good plan, but what he did not consider was that the coke mixture would leach into the produce.
all crew members were potentially exposed.
cocaine toxicity can be potentially lethal, can also cause severe behavioral changes like we saw in the master chief, which proves my theory that eating healthy is not only boring, it's downright dangerous.
uh, Hetty has arranged an NCIS Red Team in Okinawa to meet the ship and surreptitiously track the container when it's off-loaded in Japan, so that we can intercept the drugs at their final destination.
so it looks like we're going home.
right, Eric?
uh, absolutely. I've already processed your travel orders.
when? - I'd say, uh, about an hour ago.
when are we leaving?
look, guys, uh, in the spirit of the season, please don't hate me.
I tried everything, I called in every favor I could, but the earliest I can get you guys all home to Los Angeles is...
december 27. - What?
what, no, n-n-no snow, no hot tub?
Hetty can pull some strings.
she's already left for the break.
I'm sorry, she abandoned us at sea?
you know, if it's any consolation, she waited until the case was wrapped and knew you were all safe before she left.
why is it that, every time you ask if it's any consolation, it's not.
Eric, don't sweat it.
we know you worked hard-- enjoy your holidays.
Thanks, guys. You, too. And, again, I'm really sorry.
well, y'all mocked my forensic botany, but in the end...
your spinach played a vital role.
thank you, thank you for that. Was that so, uh, so hard, huh?
actually, don't beat yourself up too much.
after all, I am the only person here that's an actual detective.
that's because we're special agents.
Yeah, well, where I grew up, "special" meant that you took the short bus and wore a helmet in the sandbox.
that's almost as funny as you telling those two sailors you kicked my ass.
Really? You said that?
I didn't; my undercover character did. - Right.
gentlemen, ma'am...
I want to thank you for everything you've done for the ship, the crew and...
especially myself.
it's our pleasure, Command Master Chief.
I'm sorry that this has adversely affected your holiday plans with your family, but, uh, at least you can have some eggnog and Christmas dinner.
the cook staff pulls out all the stops for the holidays.
that sounds fantastic. Thank you, sir.
thank you very much. - Thank you.
officer on deck. - As you were.
Hetty. - Merry Christmas.
what? - We thought you were on vacation.
I was on my way to Macao for the holidays and I decided to make a pit stop here.
there is an F-18 Super Hornet up on deck for a return flight to Coronado.
the backseat is empty, Mr. Hanna.
if you were to leave right now, you could make it home by Christmas morning.
for real? - Have I ever lied to you?
I love you, Hetty.
now put me down...
thank you, sir. - Get out of here already.
merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, indeed.
merry Christmas. - Bye, Sam!
now, who's got the eggnog?
merry Christmas.
whoa, you look...
Elfin?
elfin amazing. I don't know what to say.
well, I believe the traditional greeting is "Merry Christmas
happy holidays" if you're feeling politically correct.
what was... that?
uh, I hope you have a really nice holiday and I will...
see you next year.
Hey, hey, wait, you know what? I'm just gonna go get my tights.
they're called leggings.
Oh, and don't forget your ears.
Los
okay, let's see what we got.
Deeks, I always play it cool.
I'm actually playing aloof, which is the antisocial version of cool.
okay, so, if I'm cool, and you're aloof, what does that make you?
Enigmatic? - No, no, Hetty is enigmatic.
you are... - Charming...
puerile. - handsome...
otiose. It means pointless.
what?
what? Nothing. We were just... Nothing.
he thinks you're in a bad mood.
and we're supposed to play it cool.
I'm actually playing it aloof.
Thanks, guys. Good looking out.
well, if you must know, I've killed another house plant.
that is 14 since July.
wait. That's it? That's the source of your sourness?
it was a cactus.
you killed something that thrives in Death Valley?
I went back to get another one, but, oh, the guy cut me off.
he actually took my picture to put it behind the register.
you have a mug shot at the nursery?
for crimes committed against cacti?
she is a serial plant killer.
ignore them. It's not your fault.
no, I'm pretty sure it's her fault.
well, not unless it was suicide. Did you photograph the crime scene?
why would you guys make me feel this way?
it's the job.
if you worked behind a desk and had normal hours, all of those plants would be alive.
probably.
Yeah, it's the job.
Yeah, we have to give up certain things to do what we do, you know.
right. Like my dream of home-grown oregano.
you don't even cook. - I would if I had homegrown oregano.
Yeah, I suppose if I worked 9: 00 to 5: 00, my evenings would open up...
are you okay?
Eric, do you need help?
no, no, no. I think this is like a Harry Potter deal.
no, no. I'm all over this.
I know what you're doing. You're doing charades.
and I'm awesome at this.
you're pulling up by your hands 'cause you're getting ready to milk a cow.
but it's just one udder of a cow, and it's sideways.
you're milking a sideways cow. You're really milking the...
no, we got a case. This is a lasso.
I'm throwing it, and I'm roping y'all up to OPS.
that was a lasso?
I'm trying to figure out what a cow has to do with it.
I mean,'cause used both hands-- - I'm taking a mime class.
well, actually, I'm watching a lot of YouTube videos about miming.
look, check this out. Look.
I got a wall. I'm in a box.
whoa, the box is closing in on me! Aah!
I can be a leaf. I can be in a windstorm.
I can do a kite. I can do a kite in a windstorm.
I can do an escalator.
I can do a spiral stair... - Stop. Mimes don't talk.
stay in character. Go Method.
nice work. - Thank you.
the man killed was Stuart Westridge, a private investigator.
do we have eyes on what happened?
uh, no cameras on the street.
and the morgue hasn't released its closed circuit video feed to us yet.
private investigator's going to rack up a lot of enemies.
the Navy has expressed interest in one of his cases, commissioned by the widow of a Marine.
lieutenant Edwin Prietto.
he was killed in Afghanistan two weeks ago.
his wife Antonia requested an autopsy report through the L. A. County Morgue's Office, and hired Stuart Westridge to investigate her husband's death.
what does the operations report say about Lieutenant Prietto's death?
um, not much.
just that he was killed on the Pakistani border during a routine security sweep.
it's like the Wild West out there.
constant threat of mortars, RPGs
last thing anyone's thinking about is writing a detailed operations report.
that, or a convenient cover, if you want to hide the truth.
Mrs. Prietto, we are deeply sorry for your loss.
thank you. I'm fine.
I don't know why I just said that. I am anything but fine.
I'm hurt, I'm upset, I'm looking for answers.
and I'm alone.
I keep waiting for Edwin to call.
do you have any friends or family that can help you through this?
I joined a grief support group for the families of fallen soldiers.
I knew he was in harm's way, but I was still convinced that Edwin would come home to me.
well, it's normal what you're feeling.
look, I have to ask, Mrs. Prietto.
why are you suspicious about the events surrounding your husband's death?
the man from the Marines told me... - What man?
the Casualty Assistance something.
casualty Assistance Calls Officer.
him. He kept saying that Edwin died near the Pakistani border, but I that know he was stationed in Kandahar.
he called me from there the day before he died.
I tried to talk to somebody else at the office to confirm, but it felt like they were stonewalling me.
so you hired Stuart Westridge to investigate it.
and now he's dead, too.
the worst part of all this is that...
I haven't seen my husband's body.
I don't even know the results of the autopsy yet.
we can help you with that, ma'am.
thank you.
thank you, Tony.
you want to, uh...?
what are you squinting at? Time for some granny glasses?
no, I'm trying to visualize what you'd look like behind a desk, as a public defender.
okay. - Clean-shaven, short hair.
I looked exactly like this.
like this?! - Yup.
clients actually put their lives in the hands of... this?
okay, first off, I was very good at my job. - Says you.
secondly, my clients were assigned to me, so they didn't really have a choice.
Oh, I know the feeling.
and thirdly... - Third.
thirdly, everyone knows that public defenders are the rebel of the legal profession.
rebel without a due process clause? Ha!
Kensi just made a legal funny? Is that what that was?
how you feeling right now? Pretty proud of yourself?
you know what? I'll give it to you. Touché.
Touché! - Yeah.
whoever killed Stuart Westridge hit his jugular and both carotid arteries.
either they got lucky, or they knew exactly what they were doing.
Yeah, he bled out immediately. Didn't even have a chance to call for help.
Yeah, certainly not with a severed windpipe.
LAPD tested. No fibers, no fingerprints. Car came up clean.
which means the person who did this came prepared.
police did find his gun and his wallet.
so robbery wasn't a motive. Killer was a pro.
motivation is somehow connected to Lieutenant Prietto.
Deeks, what if the Marine Corps is trying to cover something up?
rose. Thanks for meeting with us.
of course.
but Mrs. Prietto, this won't be easy for you to see.
I understand. Is that him?
did you perform the autopsy? - No, but I can tell you...
I would like to speak to the person that performed the autopsy.
of course.
it... doesn't weigh anything.
Oh, yes. Bone and tissue account for much of our body weight.
once they've been removed, we become significantly lighter.
antonia, do you need to sit down?
what do you mean,"Once they've been removed?
for the tissue donation.
my husband wasn't a tissue donor. - He must have been.
is this something you two discussed?
Yes. He would never have done that.
may I?
bone's been replaced.
with PVC pipe probably. - Yeah.
so it looks like nothing happened to him.
then they removed the skin, but only underneath the arm.
rose, was there anything else removed?
uh, I don't have his file... - Stop. Just... stop.
now do you understand why I know the Marine Corps is lying to me about where he died?
Mrs. Prietto, we don't know what this means yet.
well, I do.
the Marines had the morgue strip my husband's body, so that they could hide what happened to him in Afghanistan.
rose, explain to me how this could have happened.
how could a morgue remove tissue from someone who didn't consent?
I have no idea. We wouldn't have done it without it.
tissue doesn't have the same time frame as organs, and that's why it's performed in a morgue, but only when the deceased is a donor.
Ian. These NCIS agents have some questions about the prep you did on Lieutenant Edwin Prietto.
the Marine from a few days ago?
walk us through what you did to Lieutenant Prietto's body.
I performed an autopsy, I extracted his tissue, and then...
cleaned and prepped him for the funeral home.
he's as meticulous as they come.
he would have never removed tissue unless the paperwork ordered it.
I thought I was following his wishes.
show us Lieutenant Prietto's paperwork.
his file was just here yesterday. I-It listed him as a donor, I swear.
look... No, you have to believe him.
someone must have taken it.
we got access to the morgue's security footage?
Yep. This is Westridge breaking in.
and then, two minutes later...
must be Lieutenant Prietto's missing file.
LAPD didn't find it in Stuart Westridge's car.
which means the killer took it. But why?
Ah, the million dollar question.
Nate. How are you?
good. - Good to see you, man.
you, too. - Give me a hug. Hey.
Hi, Nate.
so... how are you guys?
we're great. What brings you to town?
I'm actually here Hetty's request.
for what case? - Nothing specific.
Oh, no. - Come on.
what? What?
semiannual psych evaluation. - For him or for us?
for him. I'm fine.
me, too. Never better.
I'm glad to hear it. How about you, Kensi?
really good.
well, I promise it will be painless.
sorry, Nate. G and I have to go, uh, interview a CACO officer. Right now.
Yeah, we have to go search this place-- the dead investigator's house... yeah.
see ya.
I'm not the enemy, you know!
they're a special bunch. Kind of tough to get through, but...
Oh, well... One of these days.
what's going on with you two? What's-what's up?
Nell and I kissed.
this is... not happening.
I'm, uh, just pretty sure that it was just to get me in a pair of tights.
just want to put it out there, let you know.
right.
preliminary report on Mr. Westridge said that LAPD didn't find anything here.
well, maybe they overlooked something.
Why? What do you got?
holy Dewey Decimal System.
looks like every case Westridge ever worked on.
that's a lot of secrets for one man to keep.
and it looked like he used to have even more.
Antonia Prietto's file-- empty.
okay, so, there's no signs of a forced entry, which means whoever killed Stuart stole his keys, made his way over to his house, and took the Prietto file before LAPD showed up.
along with his computer.
well, maybe he was using one of those cloud storage drives or a-a backup thumb drive, which means, if we find that, we can figure out what he was working on.
you know what this calls for? - What?
what are you doing?
last time I did this, I almost found a nuclear bomb.
are you kidding me?
you know what this is, Kensalina?
wireless hard drive, hidden... in plain sight.
Mr. Getz.
Hetty. Thank you for inviting me back.
Oh, pish.
you know you're more than welcome whenever you're in this time zone.
Mm-hmm. So, what's the real reason I'm here?
I mean, we both know it's not to conduct mental health checkups on the team.
hmm. I thought that was plausible.
okay. So I'm just a pawn in your game.
well, I'm gonna figure out exactly what that game is.
Oh, don't you underestimate the value of a pawn.
he's a soldier.
that was Mikhail's... Achilles' heel.
M-Mikhail? - Gorbachev.
we had a standing game in Moscow, whenever I was there.
sometimes I let him win.
that was to help the Cold War... stay cold.
can't I at least be a rook?
maybe like a... knight? Something cool?
someday.
but today... you're my very tall pawn, Mr. Getz.
maybe a bishop?
you presented Lieutenant Prietto's initial death notification to his widow?
Yes, sir.
you told her he was killed somewhere on the Pakistani border?
that's what was in the report.
do you have a copy of the paperwork that was sent to the morgue?
you notice anything unusual about Lieutenant Prietto's case?
no, sir.
says here he was a tissue donor.
do you know when he filled this out?
not for sure, but we recently changed that form.
so he must have filled it out a few months ago.
maybe Prietto had a change of heart.
Yeah, but why not tell his wife if he know how important it was to her?
thank you, Captain.
we'll let you know if we need anything else.
Yes, sir.
Thanks. - Sir.
you think the wife knows something she's not telling us?
the body of an American Marine was desecrated on our own soil.
then a man was killed investigating it.
somebody's definitely hiding something.
guys, you need to see this.
this hit the air five minutes ago.
this is Kent Shocknek, live in Los Angeles, where a veterans support group has informed us that the body of Lieutenant Edwin Prietto, killed in Afghanistan, was harvested for tissue at the Los Angeles County Morgue.
his widow claims the Marines ordered the extraction to hide the true cause of her husband's death.
a Navy spokesperson commented, only to say they are looking into the matter.
now, back to you.
Antonia went public with her story.
so much for keeping a lid on this.
this is bad, G.
we're either dealing with a distraught widow who's looking for answers or a woman with a whole other agenda.
Yes.
Yes, of course, Owen.
Granger? - You're absolutely right.
and Hetty's being nice?
bye for now.
Hetty's always nice.
Granger, on the other hand, is having a conniption.
evidently this news of Lieutenant Prietto is rapidly turning into a public relations nightmare.
so what do you want to do now?
well, I think we have to find out what the hell happened.
we found something.
well, technically, Nate suggested it, I researched it, and Eric hacked the database but...
lieutenant Prietto's unit is still in combat in Afghanistan, but another Marine was injured the day he died.
he's recuperating at the V.A. hospital here in Westwood.
he may be able to shed light on what really happened over there.
let's have Kensi and Deeks pay him a visit.
we should go back and talk to Ian Bruckhurst, find the results of that autopsy.
why don't you two work with Eric? See if this has ever happened before.
ticktock. - Ticktock.
time to put a little pressure on Ian.
Hey, Callen, wait up.
you got a minute to check in? How are things?
good. Good. How are... things with you, Nate?
great. It's really good being back.
but, well, now that I'm not around so much anymore,
I just wanted to make sure you had someone to... talk to.
you and me both.
so you do want someone to talk to.
you know what I really want? I want to meet somebody.
how did you do it? - How...?
well, it's not really my area of expertise, but, um...
I like to lay a foundation first, you know?
get to know them as a friend.
that's exactly what I told him.
but how long, you know, before you ask her out?
Oh, well, that depends.
well, this time, for instance.
this one was tricky-- it was, like... three years.
I don't think I'd really have the patience for that.
he really doesn't. Three years?
when she's the right one... you will.
that's great. Nate, thanks for the talk.
all right. - Thanks, guys.
and the psychologist becomes the patient.
he never knew what hit him until it was already over.
I hate it when he does that.
sergeant Charles, thank you so much for talking with us.
if you need a break, just let us know.
Oh, trust me, I enjoy the company.
all I wanted in Afghanistan was some privacy, but...
now that I'm here, I'll talk to anybody.
nurses all think I got crushes on 'em.
nothing wrong with that. - No.
so, what can you tell us about the day you were wounded?
not much. My memory's spotty.
doc says, uh, it's 'cause of the head injury and that it'll come back, but...
I wouldn't mind if I blocked the whole thing out for good.
do you remember how Lieutenant Prietto died?
sergeant, you okay?
Yeah, uh...
I didn't realize Lieutenant Prietto didn't make it. He was a good guy.
I'm sorry.
do you remember anything about your mission?
what you guys were doing on the Pakistani border?
Pakistan?
look, uh, I don't remember much, but if the Marine Corps said we were there, that's where we were.
I think I'll take that break now.
I hit a nerve there.
Ian, a few more questions for you.
can it wait? I'm a little busy right now.
only take a second. - All right.
does he have to stand behind me like that?
I do. - He does.
so, were you able to determine the cause of Lieutenant Prietto's death from your autopsy?
Yes. It was a single bullet wound.
entered under the left axilla, traversed through the pericardium, severed his spinal cord.
what can you tell us about the bullet?
not much. Fragmented on impact with his vertebrae.
probably impossible to trace to a specific weapon.
or to know if that's what actually killed him.
did you notice anything unusual about the way Lieutenant Prietto died?
exposure to chemicals, substances in his bloodstream, anything like that?
no. His-his cause of death was consistent with the Marine Corps' casualty report.
okay. Make sure Mrs. Prietto gets a copy of your autopsy results.
I will. And I'll also apologize for whatever mistake was made.
okay.
good morning... and welcome to the Fairfield Manor Funeral Home, where we acknowledge a life and cherish a memory.
how can I help you?
we would like to speak to your director about Lieutenant Edwin Prietto.
please come with me.
you can wait in here.
um, but don't touch anything, for obvious reasons.
I'll go get him now.
nothing creepy about this place at all.
I think it's got character.
Yeah. Pretty sure I saw that fountain in the Serial Killers Digest.
david Lerner? - Yes.
I'm happy to discuss Lieutenant Prietto, but we're still waiting on his body.
the Marines delivered him directly to the morgue.
but didn't Mrs. Prietto hire you to arrange the burial?
we have a relationship with the CACO office because we offer at-cost funerals for fallen servicemen coming home to Los Angeles.
were you aware that Lieutenant Prietto was a tissue donor?
no, I was not. Hmm.
we may have to do some additional cosmetic work before the viewing.
well, apparently, Mrs. Prietto wasn't aware of that, either.
Ah. I see.
it-it's entirely possible he decided to become a donor after seeing his fellow servicemen wounded in combat.
regardless, we will do whatever we can to help Mrs. Prietto through the grieving process.
thank you. We will contact you if we have any further questions.
thank you so much.
Eric, what's up? You've had the investigator's hard drive for almost an hour.
I'm sorry. Someone had some really pungent sauerkraut for lunch, and it's throwing me off my game.
okay, we're in. - Good.
all right, open the last folder Stuart accessed.
let's see what he was working on.
he just updated this one yesterday.
hours before he was killed.
those look like surveillance photos.
Eric, can you enlarge those?
that's Rose.
no, that-that can't be right. I mean, we know Rose, right?
she's... she's a friend.
who just became a person of interest.
Hetty, we don't know what these photos mean.
Oh, except that a private investigator, who's dead, was looking into Rose.
he was hired to investigate what happened to Lieutenant Prietto in Afghanistan.
why would he be interested in Rose?
maybe he thought that she was responsible for harvesting Lieutenant Prietto's tissue.
the only one way to be sure is to ask her.
slow down, Mr. Callen.
I think I'd like Mr. Getz to take the lead in this.
you want me to question Rose?
but... I know her. Is-Isn't that a conflict?
an NCIS agent will question a person of interest. Nothing more.
I don't know how comfortable I am interrogating Rose.
now, that's your word, Mr. Getz, not mine.
Nate, the only way to clear her name is to get answers.
just talk to her like a friend.
it's your move, Mr. Getz.
I guess it's time to play the pawn.
you have your assignment.
is this the real reason you brought in Nate?
Mr. Hanna, you know I don't kiss and tell.
so this is where the magic happens.
something like that.
Oh... Is anyone else here, or is it just us?
or are we on camera?
wait, am I gonna meet Hetty?
I-I doubt you'll meet Hetty today.
she's off... playing chess.
Oh. Cool. - Come here.
okay.
Oh, this is stark. - Yeah.
it's our interrogation room.
so we're definitely on camera now. Hi, Mom.
rose, could you please take a seat for a minute?
you're acting so formal.
I need to ask you a few questions.
questions like, what's my favorite movie?
or questions like... "Where were you the evening of November fourth?
somewhere in between, but... a little closer to the second one.
What?!
you...
you're interrogating me?
Nate, do you think I had something to do with what happened at the morgue?
please sit.
what is this? Wha...?
where did you get these?
these photographs were taken by the investigator Antonia Prietto hired...
who's now dead.
well, um... why am I in these pictures?
I was hoping you could tell me that.
so... this is Rose's place.
I would've thought it would be more flowery.
I feel icky just being here. She's our friend.
how do you think Nate feels?
have you ever had to interrogate someone you're close to?
Oh, yeah. One time, there was this, uh...
this banker-- she was wearing this sweet pantsuit.
very repressed, but I got her to, uh...
not talking about role playing.
Kens? - Yeah.
it's gonna be fine. It's Rose.
I know.
and the investigator was probably going to tail everybody that works at the morgue anyway.
exactly. This is just a formality.
Deeks? - Yeah?
I found Lieutenant Prietto's morgue file.
Hello, Rose.
you found it!
Yeah. On your dining room table.
What?! Well, I don't know how it got there.
please tell me you can give us something better than that.
Callen, I had nothing to do with preparing Lieutenant Prietto's body.
there's no reason his file would be in my house.
wait-- you went through my house?!
you brought me here so they could go through my stuff?
rose, it's not like that. It's just...
what? - It's my job.
if you had nothing to do with Lieutenant Prietto, why'd you sign his paperwork?
I didn't process this, and-and that is not my signature.
here's the receipt for Sprinkles. - Sprinkles?
it's a cupcake place.
Nate took me to dinner last night, so I treated for dessert.
can I see your driver's license?
she's telling the truth.
it-it's pretty close, but...
that is not her signature on this file.
Eric and Nell found something.
Eric, you want to tell 'em what you found?
Nell and I combed through the County Morgue files, like you asked.
in the last 18 months, there's been a spike in the number of tissue donors.
they weren't all military, but each one was disease-free when they died, and buried by the Fairfield Manor Funeral Home.
and Ian Bruckhurst's name is on all their morgue transfer orders.
so Ian and the funeral home were working together.
Yeah, stealing tissue from dead bodies, and then turning around and selling them on the black market.
and Lieutenant Prietto wasn't the only one.
Eric, I need you to trace Ian Bruckhurst's cell for me.
way ahead of you. He's at 4372 Santa Monica Boulevard.
that's the Fairfield Manor Funeral Home.
how do you want to play this?
with a little help.
okay.
good afternoon and welcome to the Fairfield Manor Funeral Home, where we acknowledge a life and cherish a memory.
how may I help you?
uh, my name is... Beatrice Fitzpatrick.
a-and this is my son Chester.
we need to make arrangements for... Daddy.
is the director available?
I'm sorry for your loss. Please wait here while I fetch him.
you remember Felix, don't you, sweetheart?
I skinned him myself.
please tell me you're in character.
hello. I'm David Lerner. Uh, Mrs. Fitzpatrick?
Oh, yes, yes. Uh, and this is my son Chester.
your... son. Well.
your father must've been a very tall man.
don't pretend like you knew Daddy.
Oh, no, of course not.
um, please follow me. I would love to show you the facility.
Hetty, Nate, keep him busy until we find Ian.
a-and this is Felix.
he's... almost like a second child to me.
I think we're good.
Kens, Deeks, you're good to move in.
okay, that's a big oven. - And it's on.
I think someone's in there.
quick, check to see if it's Ian before the face melts off.
you check to see if it's Ian before the face melts off.
I don't want to. - I don't want to either.
do it. - Not it!
Oh, son of a...
mm, that is not him. - Are you sure?
Yeah, no, I'm absolutely positively sure.
it's a woman who hopefully died very peacefully in her sleep-- yeah.
okay.
are you doing?
he could be hiding.
from who? He doesn't know we're looking for him.
Eric... - Yep.
please call Ian's cell phone. - I'm on it.
What'd I say?
you got me?
uno, dos...
that's all kinds of dead.
guess their partnership went south.
but we still don't know what they were doing with all the bone and tissue.
then let's go find out.
so, Mrs. Fitzpatrick, now that I have a better sense of Daddy, uh, exactly what type of service did you have in mind?
well... I've always envisioned palominos galloping alongside the procession.
and, um, doves.
Yes. Doves.
uh, of course. Um, that would be our platinum package. Wonderful choice.
it's very tasteful, yet it has that certain panache.
you David Lerner?
Yes, but... I am with a client right now.
if you wouldn't mind stepping outside for just a few minutes...
I do mind. You owe us money.
I am so sorry. Look...
listen. Ian Bruckhurst owes us money, but we can't find him,
he used you as collateral, ergo, you owe us money, and we're here to collect.
Yes, but you can't hold this gentleman accountable for someone else's debts.
mummy's right.
well, Mummy needs to mind her own damn business.
this man owes us 45 large.
whatever for?
you need to learn when to shut your trap.
shut my what?
unless you want me to choke you out with that dead dog you got around your neck.
excuse me! I demand to know what this is all about.
Oh, I'm sorry, shorty. I-I don't kiss and tell.
I think I've heard just about enough.
Chester... we're leaving.
n-no. Mrs. Fitzpatrick, please, I...
you ready to stop playing games?
I don't know who this Ian person is, and I certainly don't have $45, 000 for you.
he told us all about your little scam there at the morgue.
from what we hear, you're rolling in it.
you don't know what you're talking about.
we know all about Lieutenant Prietto.
well, who doesn't? The guy's all over the news.
we know you stole his tissue, and you did it to about 50 other people, too.
please, I...
all right, all right, but it was maybe half that number at best.
then you got our money.
I don't have 45 grand. All I've got is Ian's cut.
we'll take it.
all right, just got to go to the office and, um...
now, these, I like.
this something I can reserve?
port, arms!
ready... aim... fire!
aim, fire!
aim... fire!
present... arms!
we wanted to pay our respects. - Thank you again.
I'm sorry for the accusations, but I knew something wasn't right.
we're happy we could help you find the truth.
I couldn't have said good-bye to him without knowing.
you helped me find closure.
well, your country owed you and your husband that much.
I won't forget this.
Hey, Nate... why don't you go talk to her?
good luck, buddy.
rose. - Hi, Nate.
I knew you were innocent.
I had to ask you those questions. It's my job.
I know.
I hope you can forgive me.
me, too.
turns out a civilian was forging paperwork.
he was checking the tissue donor box on dead Marines returning to Los Angeles.
and the funeral parlor would reach out to the family, then make sure the casket got sent to the morgue.
at which point, Ian would forge Rose's signature and harvest the tissue.
the money must have been worth their while.
it's a booming business.
and bone and tissue from healthy bodies goes for...
$200, 000 a pop.
Mr. Granger pulled a couple of strings, learned that Lieutenant Prietto was killed in an ongoing classified mission.
that's why the Marines couldn't tell Antonia the truth about how he died.
would've compromised the lives of too many Marines.
how's Mr. Getz?
he's been better. But he'll be fine.
would you look in on him, Mr. Callen?
and... give him this. Tell him he earned it.
that's a good-looking chess set.
and Mr. Hanna... would you please take a seat?
I just want to commend you on your undercover performance yesterday.
your words sounded quite genuine.
thank you, Hetty.
I hope you're not upset.
I'm sensing some hostility here.
Oh, Mr. Hanna...
I'm just getting started.
what do you mean by "Shorty"?
Where's Quinn? Mr. Sidorov wishes to see you.
what's the job? - Name's Kirkin. $1 million cash.
Sidorov says that he wants Kirkin dead.
who would Kirkin use for a hit in the U. S?
I'm being set up.
you did not recover the bombs?
no, they're gone.
now there's three nuclear weapons out there.
Sidorov will sell those bombs to anybody.
a nuclear bomb on the open market would go for millions.
you let him leave the country?
Sidorov left on a diplomatic flight.
we're talking about nuclear weapons.
we're gonna get this bastard, right?
hell, yeah.
how would you describe the way we settle disagreements?
I apologize, even when it's not my fault.
typical male/female dynamic. Why?
what's your greatest fear? - Quicksand. No, headhunters, actually.
headhunters and being buried up to my neck in an ant hill, which headhunters do.
so, basically, anything in a Tarzan movie?
pretty much.
do you have reoccurring nightmares?
just the one with Hetty and the burning monkey.
what? - What?
I thought everybody had that.
I know Eric does.
that's awkward.
what other job would you be doing if you couldn't be in law enforcement?
gigolo. - Seriously?
schoolteacher. - Really?
who lives a double life as a gigolo.
why are you asking me all these questions?
it's just a... partner survey. - I didn't get one.
well... Hey, give it back.
hold on, hold on. How would you describe the way you smell?
what the...? This isn't from Hetty, this is from a bridal magazine.
no, no, this isn't for partner-partners.
okay, just give it back. I'll-- Forget about it.
no, no, no... Hold on a second. - What?
why are you reading bridal magazines?
it was in the Laundromat.
so, you stole it? - Just-- It's from 2007.
Oh, my God... Your biological clock.
shut it. Don't say another word.
that's so funny,'cause I always thought that ticking was a bomb, - but it turns out it's you wanting to make a baby. - Stop it.
you want to make it with me? We can make some ninja assassins...
sorry. Viktor Varlamov was murdered on the beach this morning.
Tick-tock...
Oh, uh, don't forget to fill out your partner survey.
we pulled this from a Venice chess park.
it's the only camera and the only angle.
you think this is related to Isaak Sidorov?
Sidorov thinks a rival Mob boss, Anatoli Kirkin, hired Varlamov to assassinate him.
it's one of the reasons Sidorov fled the country.
well, maybe he's back.
Sidorov has three stolen nukes.
maybe getting rid of Kirkin and Varlamov is step one.
the killer made sure not to show his face. It's as if he knew where the camera was.
why didn't he choose a bench that wasn't on camera?
proof of the hit.
he staged it so someone could watch from a remote location.
find out who was watching this feed at the time, send us everything you have on Varlamov.
why don't you see if the killer left any clues.
uh, where are you going?
talk to one of Varlamov's poker buddies.
I believe that falls under adding insult to injury.
what do you think this falls under? - Maybe he flipped off the wrong guy.
the Cyrillic letters are the English equivalent to S-L-O-N.
what do you think "Slon" means?
well, maybe it's the name of the guy that killed him.
I guess it could be Russian.
or they could both be parts of the same puzzle-- you know, Slon and a missing finger.
finger and Slon: Fingerslon. Fingerstein...
das ist, das ist ein Fingerslon. - I'm so alone.
das ist ein... Does this mean we're not looking for a German Nail SPA?
Kensi? Huh, liebchen?
the word "Slon," in Russian, is carved on his forehead and he's missing his little finger.
Yeah. - We're sending you a photo right now.
all right, Kens, thanks.
so, whoever killed Varlamov, he cut off one of his fingers and scratched that into his forehead.
what's it mean?
Slon. It's Russian for elephant.
so who's the elephant? - "Bay-bar"?
what? - The elephant, from the kids' book.
you mean Babar. You pronounce it Babar. - I don't think so.
I have a little girl. She watches those Babar movies repeatedly. It's Babar.
maybe he changed his name when he came to Hollywood.
it's Babar, trust me.
Yeah, he looks dead. Whoever killed him used an ice pick.
brutal but effective. This government issue?
what happened to you eating healthy, huh?
you two still together. That's nice.
you've lasted longer than any of my marriages. What is secret?
we don't go to bed angry. - I let him drive.
you know who killed this guy? - Why would I know?
because I'm Russian? We all look the same to you?
you think I know everything every Russian is doing in this state?
just the criminals.
that hurts.
who killed Varlamov? - I don't know.
but you have an idea.
would his name be Slon, by any chance? - I don't think so.
so who's the elephant? - Babar.
he's Russian.
in this case,"Slon" does not mean elephant.
it's acronym. It stands for "Suki Lyubat Ostry Nozh.
bitches love a sharp knife.
it's old Russian prison code.
is it prison code to chop a guy's finger off?
depends what is on that finger. - Like a ring?
more like a tattoo. Valmorov was a Vor, a thief.
he had thief's tattoo on his middle finger to show he is part of Vory brotherhood.
so, whoever killed him chopped off his finger to show he was no longer in the club?
something like that, yeah.
who do you know that would do something like this?
someone who works for someone who wants him dead.
someone who spent time in Russian prison and is fond of ice picks.
someone like...
Greshnev left the country with his boss Sidorov.
maybe, maybe not.
either way, I'd definitely say he's back now.
if Sidorov and Greshnev are back, they must have a buyer for the stolen nukes.
if they're back, they're coming for my wife.
Michelle, where are you?
we have unexpected guests from out of town. You need to call me right now.
last time you couldn't reach her was because of a Christmas play.
Christmas is over.
I'd still like to see another one.
what do you suppose was in that letter?
don't look behind you"?
it was probably just a plant to lure him there and distract him.
well, whoever planted the letter must have called Varlamov to tell him to look for it.
Hey, guys. - Yeah, Nell, we need you Varlamov's phone records.
will do. But we just got a call from Callen.
he thinks Sidorov and his man Greshnev may be back in the country.
well, it makes sense, if they killed Varlamov.
also means that Kirkin might be next.
if Sidorov is back, he's probably trying to sell those stolen nukes.
where are Sam and Callen?
on their way to Sam's house. They can't reach his wife Michelle.
all right, tell them we'll go there and meet them.
I'm afraid the two of you are needed elsewhere.
our old friend, Officer Snyder, from the CIA, is on his way to the boatshed.
assistant Director Granger wants us to partner up with him.
what? Why?
because if this does involve Sidorov and the missing nukes, then it's bigger than both our agencies.
when you say "partner," you mean just keep him in the loop, right?
I think more like a double date.
what? - Uh... we're babysitting?
think of it as animal control.
I need you to keep Officer Snyder busy until Callen and Sam can get a handle on this.
do not let him out of your sight.
what are you doing? - What the hell are you doing?
I was calling you. - I had the vacuum on.
and I could have killed you. You were wearing headphones.
you're lucky I didn't crack your skull open.
so, I take it, we're all good in here?
Yeah. - No.
miss Former CIA was wearing headphones while she was vacuuming.
what the hell is that supposed to mean?
I'm surprised you even know we have a vacuum, because you sure as hell never use it.
excuse me? - You heard me.
now, what are you two doing, sneaking up in here like the damn Hardy Boys?
I'm just gonna run outside and make a quick phone call, all right?
no, no, no. Wait, G. Come on, G!
you want to tell me what's going on?
I was very specific with Hetty when I told her I needed to see Hanna.
he's on assignment. - What about his wife?
Michelle? - Does he have more than one?
I don't know. Does he? - I don't think so.
cute. You two really think you can stall and keep me here all day?
I don't know. Can we? - How are we doing so far?
we're just trying to help you, Agent Snyder.
officer Snyder, and you two can't help me.
actually, you could probably help me.
Wow. Nice.
you don't even look like you could help yourself.
Wow. Was I just insulted?
sounded pretty insulting to me. Definitely condescending.
almost disdainful. - Borderline supercilious.
well, I am super silly, so I guess you got me there.
point to Poindexter. High five. See you later.
you're interfering with a federal investigation.
but we are federal investigators.
wait a minute. Now I'm confused. Who's on first?
keep it up, but even that garden gnome you call a boss won't be able to save your asses if you screw the pooch on this one.
garden gnomes... screwing of pooches... What world do you live in?
Hey, want to see me dislocate my wrist?
Hey. I sent Varlamov's phone records to your tablet.
cool. Thanks.
how would you describe the way we settle disagreements?
what disagreements? - Exactly.
what is your greatest fear? - Ooh. The day the robots turn on us.
artificial intelligence run amok. - Nothing scarier.
agreed.
all right. I already know your Hetty nightmare, so...
what other job would you be doing if you couldn't be in law enforcement?
is this a test? - It is a partner survey.
are we getting graded on it? - I don't know.
professional Renfair performer.
Oh... my lady dost knowest me well.
um, how would you describe the way I smell?
Yeah. That's weird. - Little bit.
we're gonna skip that one. - Okay.
what part of my body do you...?
okay. - What?
this is a partner... partner survey...
...which we have no business filling out.
okay, I'll just keep...
Hey, Callen. So, no sign of Greshnev or his boss, Sidorov, entering the country.
and Eric's still weeding through IP addresses logged onto the chess cam.
we did, however, get access to Varlamov's recent phone records.
anything stand out?
one new number popped up two days ago; looks like a burn phone.
I'm still trying to find out where it was purchased.
let me know when you do.
how's everything with Sam's wife?
just a little domestic misunderstanding. I'll touch base when we have a plan.
thanks for having my back in there, partner.
I will take a bullet for you, but wives are a whole other thing.
I'll remember that. - I don't have a wife, so...
you should stop talking. - So, I'm not speaking from experience.
so you should really stop talking. But you won't.
Greshnev doesn't know where you live.
he knows you as David Forman, he knows Michelle as Quinn.
he did. What if Greshnev didn't just get here?
what if he never left?
we assume he split the country with Sidorov, but maybe he stayed behind to make sure Michelle killed Kirkin.
if he's been here the whole time, he could have made her by now.
it's possible, but... - But what?
if he was here, he had a whole four months to watch Michelle.
she's careful. She's a pro.
we all make mistakes.
if Greshnev's been here all this time, why did he wait till now to kill Varlamov?
he could have whacked him a long time ago, right?
we arrested that guy for murder.
Oh, hell, no!
Sam, no!
stop! He's one of us!
who the hell are you?
officer Sabatino.
we used to work together. He's with the Agency.
you're CIA?
just out of curiosity: What if I wanted to join the CIA?
Oh, you'd be a good spy. He's very sneaky.
I prefer stealthy. - Okay, he's very stealthy.
also, I'm a master of disguise.
Oh, you should see his Margaret Thatcher impersonation. Uncanny.
uncanny. Huh?
Margaret Thatcher on a cold day? Who's gonna see that coming?
not me. Hello. It's Maggie. And then, bam!
bam! Except for that sounded a little bit like the queen.
what? Hello. - Hello.
hello. - Hello.
have you seen my corgis? They've run amok.
you're both quite comical.
but you know what's really amusing?
you two think, by stalling me, that you're keeping me here, when, in reality, I'm keeping the two of you here.
what? You see that? He did the double reverse on us.
no. You're good. He's good.
see, that's what I'm talking about. Central Intelligence training. Teach me that.
Oh, me, too. And if we both join together, can we get a signing bonus?
or a... a set of, uh, commemorative plates?
what is he doing here? - I found Snyder's name on his collar.
wait. He works for you? - Vostanik Sabatino.
sorry I couldn't identify myself the last time our paths crossed.
you're a spook? - He killed someone. What was his name?
brent Bolton. - I didn't kill him.
I was working his wife Mia as an asset when her husband came at me with a gun.
he tripped, fell on some stairs, the gun went off, and Bolton shot himself. End of story.
and now she's a widow, and he's dead. And you want us to work with Mr. Sympathy?
I don't. Granger does.
Hey, guys? A computer at an LA public library logged onto the chess park cam ten minutes before Varlamov showed up.
whoever it was logged off right after he was killed.
I'm guessing it's not a coincidence.
nice work. We'll check it out.
where is Sam?
he's going back undercover as David Forman, as his wife Michelle goes under as Quinn.
has Sidorov tried to contact her?
not yet, but if Greshnev's back, Sidorov won't be far behind, which means it's only a matter of time.
and when he does, we need to be there. And preferably, without Sonny and Cher here?
Yeah, that's not gonna happen. - I got you, babe.
you know I was doing this before you were.
and you've been out of it for a while.
and when we decided to have a family, we agreed...
what, that I'd give up my life?
you knew I'd go back to work eventually.
not for Isaak Sidorov. - Why?
why do you think? - Because it's too dangerous? Are you kid...?
what do you think I go through every day you go out that door?
I know. I know. I know. I'm sorry.
sorry. I can't help it.
and if it's not Sidorov, it's going to be someone else just like him, or worse.
this is what I do, Sam.
it's what we do for our country, for our daughter, for each other.
I'm glad we're doing it together.
hell, most couples are lucky if they get a date night once a week.
I like date night. What's wrong with date night?
at least no one's trying to kill us on date night.
well, no one recovered stolen nukes on date night, either. Come on.
let's go get some bad guys.
there is one up side to all of this. - What's that?
we're on our own for a few days. - We got work to do.
Oh, no, no, no, no. I was in prison, remember?
perhaps you should go back.
when did you get back? - Who said I left?
Where's Sidorov? - Where have you been?
we were taking care of something in San Diego.
why is he talking? - He's with me.
why am I talking? You're in my crib.
I'm guessing he's the reason Kirkin is still alive.
I haven't had the opportunity.
Kirkin's paranoid, he's got more security than ever.
he seldom goes out now.
you have 24 hours to kill Kirkin.
impossible.
you tell Sidorov he can take his money and find someone else.
he hired you. You have contract.
not to honor it would be an insult and a mistake.
Eric, Greshnev just left the cover house. Keep him in your sights.
will do.
where are you going? - To follow him.
what if he makes you? - He won't.
but if he does, so what? He'll just think I'm the jealous boyfriend.
he'd be half right.
I copied the hard drive, but I doubt we'll find anything good.
the librarian said she'd burn us a copy of the surveillance tapes from this morning.
should only take a few minutes. - Oh, great.
Yeah.
cop or soldier? - Excuse me?
your father. Was he, uh, law enforcement or military?
Why?
Ah, well, it's just that you, um...
you carry yourself with a real confidence and authority.
are you hitting on me?
no. Well, maybe a little. Don't worry, I'm harmless.
in this business? With our lives?
hell, I can't even keep a plant alive, let alone a relationship.
Plus, I,uh...
I wouldn't want to step into the middle of something.
something? - Yeah. Between you and your partner.
between me and my...
there is nothing going on between me and, um...
Deeks? - Yeah. No.
no, no, no, no, no, we are not a good match.
we wouldn't... we... we're barely good partners.
that's good. For him. Both of you, really.
does CIA have mind-control machines? - I wish.
who shot JFK? - Lee Harvey Oswald.
who else? You don't even know, do you?
are there aliens in Area 51? - No.
what? You're smiling. That's a tell.
that means there's aliens in Area 51. I knew it.
I'm smiling out of the irony that while I'm sitting here, stuck, listening to your incessant babble...
why, thank you.
...my partner is up there hitting on your smoking hot partner.
Yeah, well, doesn't really matter, he can hit on her all he wants.
the fact of the matter is that she is a stone cold fox.
emphasis on "stone cold.
well, just be happy that she's your partner...
and not your girlfriend.
if you were my partner, I'd end up falling for you. Hard.
then what would I do? Good partners are hard to find.
I need someone I can trust to have my back. I wouldn't want to lose that.
and I'd never want to see you in jeopardy.
so you couldn't possibly be my partner. It's a dilemma.
right, um...
well, I think... I think it's stupid, personally...
Ooh. Excuse me. - What?
uh... Sam is following Greshnev, and Eric is going to talk us in, so I thought I should...
you had to come in here to tell me that? You couldn't just text me?
Yeah, no, I definitely-- I could have texted you, it just seemed kind of impersonal.
I though maybe we should ride together, since we know the streets.
all the more reason for you to ride with Snyder.
we will follow you.
right. - Go.
Yeah, all right. - Like the tie.
sweatshirt.
case in point.
you still on him, Eric?
Yup. He's about a block and a half east of you.
he's actually a very courteous and cautious driver, for a bad guy.
are you kidding me?
Eric, stick with Greshnev. I'm being pulled over.
I'm on it.
out of the car! Now!
what?
let's go! Hands where I can see them!
hands on your head.
got a gun.
got another gun.
got concealed carry permits for both of those.
you got one for this too?
david Forman? - Yeah?
your lawyer's here. - It's about time he showed up.
Hello, Sam. - What are you doing here?
I should ask you the same question.
the police found Varlamov's murder weapon and his severed finger in your car.
Yeah, Greshnev had me framed to get me out of the way.
looks like he's done an admirable job.
damn lucky he didn't kill you.
he wouldn't risk Quinn refusing to kill Kirkin, or being too distraught for the job.
having me arrested gets me out of the way.
Quinn's used to me being in jail.
Where's Callen?
I couldn't ask him to come. - Why not?
I didn't want to damage your partnership with any ill feelings.
why would I have ill feelings?
because I'm not bailing you out. - What?
we can't risk tipping off Sidorov. - Hetty...
I'm sorry, Sam. You're safer in here.
I need to be with Michelle.
you have my word that we will do everything we can to protect her.
Hetty... - Open the gate.
come back here. Come back!
you what?!
it was in everyone's best interest.
clearly not Sam's. What if something happens to Michelle?
see that it doesn't.
if this is part of one of your master plans, now would be a really good time to let me in on it.
no, I don't have a plan.
you have no plan. Perfect.
but I have every confidence that you and your team will come up with one.
Sam is part of that team. - Not today.
adjust and adapt, Mr. Callen.
after all, that is the key to our survival.
well, we're obviously missing something.
what does Sidorov want?
he wants Quinn to kill his rival, Kirkin, so he can come back and sell the nukes that he stole.
that's it. - I mean, the broad strokes, yeah, that's it.
no, that's how we get Sidorov and Greshnev.
okay, this is gonna be hard to believe, but I'm not exactly following the Kensi logic train.
apparently, it doesn't make stops in my neighborhood.
we have a plan. - We do?
well, let's hear it.
we kill Kirkin. - That's out of the box.
but we don't really kill him.
we make Sidorov and Greshnev believe Quinn did.
they'll come out of hiding to pay her off, and when they do, we track them back to the stolen nukes.
and what makes you think that Kirkin's gonna cooperate with us?
I mean, the guy is a career criminal.
but he's also a businessman, and Sidorov is a rival, which we eliminate by arresting him.
that's good.
it could work. - I'll run it by Callen.
problem is that Sidorov only gave Quinn 24 hours to make the hit, which means it's got to go down today.
what do we know about getting to Kirkin?
he travels with a lot of protection, but he's also got a bad back from a bullet he took a few years ago.
does a good chunk of the day's business at a spa that's a favorite with Russian Mob types.
I've taken a bullet, why can't I work from a spa?
he also likes blondes.
all right. I will wear a wig, but I will not dye my hair for this man.
wouldn't help. You're not his type.
what's his type?
no... Really?
come on.
so? - Snyder's covering the back.
Deeks, you hear me?
Deeks, say something.
are you there? Deeks?
uh... yeah, I can... hear you.
what are you wearing?
that's not funny. It's like a gulag water park in here.
both of which are more than I'm wearing right now.
how you doing? Good to see you.
Oh, really? - Hi... that's-- no.
Uh-huh. Again, not funny. I'm serious.
I'm pretty sure a naked Viggo Mortensen's going to jump out any second and start pummeling me.
any sign of Kirkin?
Yeah, he's, uh, surrounded by a ton of tattooed meat.
excuse me? - That was a poor choice of words.
all right, this is happening.
Aah! Oh, that's hot!
you better be talking about the water and not the scenery.
how you doing? Like your tattoos.
I mean, I don't... I don't mean, like, I like like your tattoos,
I just mean that I appreciate their artistic merit, because I, myself, was thinking about getting a tattoo, you know like a...
like a unicorn, except for, like, a really bad-ass unicorn that's like breathing fire and he's got nunchuks and stuff.
I just thought that would be a good... idea.
okay, I'm just gonna... go...
Wow. So, invitation only? Yeah?
I just-- I have a proposition for your boss.
not much of a talker, are you?
that's probably why Communism failed.
yo, uh... Mr. Kirkin? How are you?
Oh, he said it's okay. I'm gonna go around.
whoa, back it up there, comrade, the last thing you want is any accidental underwater contact, so just give me, like... Maybe more.
all right, all right, all right.
who are you?
detective Marty Deeks, LAPD, but I'm currently working for NCIS.
you're a little out of your neighborhood, right?
not to mention my comfort zone. - What do you want?
well, this is gonna sound funny, but we actually want to kill you.
just let me explain...
Deeks, can you hear me?
I'm not waiting any longer. Tell center I'm going in.
what the hell happened in there. - Kirkin is in. He'll do it.
good job. - Thank you.
I was trying to call you. Are you okay?
you know I just feel really dirty. I think maybe, I just need a hug.
a little snuggle session. - What ya...
you're like a wet dog.
cause I had to change really quickly.
don't have time to dry for my own safety.
funny. I'll tell Callen to prep Michelle.
is anybody else itchy?
I loaded it myself.
any questions? - Where's Sam?
in a safe place.
yo, I want my phone call, man. This is forcible confinement.
you already saw your lawyer.
that wasn't my lawyer, man. I get to speak to an attorney.
you violate my Sixth Amendment rights, they throw my arrest out quicker than you can beat an innocent suspect.
put your hands out.
Thanks, man.
all right, let's go. You got one call. Make it quick.
can I, uh, get you anything else, sir?
sorry that I asked.
did Kirkin just wink at you?
Yeah, that's his way of letting me know that he's ready.
can I get you a drink? - Vodka soda, please.
okay. - Where's your restroom?
all the way down on the right.
Eric, I'm sending you eyewitness footage right now.
make sure it gets onto the local news outlets and onto the Internet.
tell Callen Sabatino and Snyder are in position and we're a go.
on it. - LAPD just released a BOLO for David Forman.
Sam assaulted a police officer and escaped lockup.
good Lord.
I see you haven't lost your touch.
Where's my money? - On the plane.
what plane?
I have a charter leaving in 30 minutes.
I'm not going anywhere.
you shot and killed a Russian Mob boss in broad daylight.
it might be best for you to get out of town for a while.
Greshnev's clocking you.
your boyfriend's heading back to prison. There's no reason to stay.
how'd you know David got arrested?
I think you've been made.
take him. Take him.
you set this up.
what are you talking about? We need to get out of here-- now.
you're not going anywhere.
he's dead.
how the hell did you find us? - Michelle's phone.
are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.
Yes, sir. No, sir.
I will, uh, pass on your condolences.
was that Granger? - Yeah.
did Snyder have a family?
uh, divorced. No kids.
goes with the territory, I guess.
any, uh, sign of Sidorov?
nothing yet, but we'll find him.
losing Greshnev is gonna hurt, and he's still got three stolen nukes he's got to sell.
let's hope we find him before he finds a buyer.
we have every law enforcement agency in the state looking for him, so...
Yeah. All right. Well, I...
...I better get going.
I'm being called back to Washington to head up a new task force with the sole purpose of hunting down Sidorov and the missing nukes.
hopefully we can grab a celebratory drink when this is over.
sure.
sounds great.
Thanks.
promise me you'll never do that.
what's that?
get yourself killed.
well, the good news for you is I have a natural aversion to death, so...
I'm not kidding.
okay. - Okay.
but if I am killed in the line of duty, you do me a favor?
Yeah.
cryogenically freeze me and put me in your living room?
what on earth would I do with your dead frozen body in my living room?
you're right. I guess the bedroom's much more intimate.
what? I'm gonna be in suspended animation-- you wouldn't have to feed me.
it's way better than an aquarium.
good night.
you smell like sunshine!
and gunpowder.
two of my favorite things.
if he's smart, Sidorov will try and get back out of the country.
greed trumps common sense every time.
if he has a buyer for those nukes, he's not going anywhere.
well, he may have just made this easier for us.
Really? Again?
am I grounded?
don't you dare take this lightly, Sam Hanna. You didn't trust me.
you didn't trust me either. Otherwise, you wouldn't have left me locked up.
it was for your own safety. - I wasn't worried about my safety.
but I was.
I was trying to protect my wife.
and I was trying to protect all of us.
now I have to try and explain how Sidorov escaped and why our only other lead is dead.
what do you want me to say, Hetty? I'm sorry?
I don't want you to say anything, Sam. I want you to go home.
spend some time with your family while you can.
this is far from over.
what? Why?
you're giving me late notice on this, but I'll try to figure out something.
say it ain't so. - It's so.
but you've got a plan. - Up and running.
all right, if Sam clears his throat any harder, he's gonna break a hip.
Kensi. - Yeah?
what are you doing Saturday night?
uh... nothing. I mean... Why?
G got tickets to the Clippers game. My babysitter flaked out on me.
his wife's out of the country.
you want me to babysit? - Now that you mention it.
that is a great idea.
we'll do it. - What? - Yep.
no, I want you at least 500 feet away from my kids, minimal.
what are you talking about? I'm great with kids.
Yeah. See, I'm not. Kids and me-- we don't mix.
wait. What? Are you one of those people that hates kids?
hate's a strong word.
well, you clearly don't like them.
no... - You hate my kids?
Oh, gosh, Sam, no.
you hate my kids. - No.
this... changes everything.
what? What does it change?
you're a hater. - No, Sam...
a kid hater.
Eric, I don't hate kids. - Sure, you don't.
this is Miguel Barbosa.
he's the kingpin of the Barbosa cartel in Tijuana, Mexico.
seems like every time we take one of these guys down, another five grow in their place.
each one worse than the next.
Barbosa was gunned down in a high-noon shootout with local law enforcement in Tijuana, Mexico.
wow, big catch.
well, they were backed by Americans.
navy kept Barbosa's reinforcements from arriving on the water, and DEA added firepower on the ground.
and here it comes: "But...
but Barbosa's corpse was stolen upon arrival at the morgue.
that's common with the cartels.
deprives law enforcement of a trophy and allows them to bury their own.
the shooter knew this corpse was coming in.
how long was he waiting in the container?
there. Shooter got there two hours before the body.
he knew the gunfight was gonna happen and Barbosa was gonna get smoked.
sounds like our side has a leak.
that's why he assigned us the case.
find the leak, track down Barbosa's body.
who ran this op at the DEA?
uh, Agent John Ness. He's with the L. A. office.
should be expecting us.
and Tijuana police have a high-value informant who's an expert on the Barbosa cartel, but they'll only release information on him in person and on their own turf.
all right, we'll speak with Ness.
why don't you guys head down to Tijuana, see if this informant has any idea where the body went?
well, Kensi should be fine, unless, of course, the informant is a child.
and yet I've managed to get along with you this entire time.
you guys have plans this weekend?
Yep. - Yep.
good-bye, Clippers game.
can I be of assistance, gentlemen?
Nope. We're good.
file on Ness indicates he's a serious guy.
practically lives at the office.
can't be bought.
an old-school gunslinger type. - Yeah, I heard about him.
he used to run counter-narcotics ops back in the '90s, Latin America.
his call sign was "Ahab"" - He's an obsessive guy.
congrats - Agents Callen and Hanna? - That's us. You Agent Ness?
one and only. - How you doing?
good. - How's it going?
good. So, does SECNAV really think I got Barbosa stuffed and mounted in my office?
not exactly.
because I think it's a damn good idea.
it's too bad the cartels got their hands on him before I did.
let's go talk in here.
we're not interrogating you, Ness. - Maybe I'm interrogating you.
it doesn't have to be like this.
if we're talking about Miguel Barbosa, it does.
hope you don't mind if I have a seat.
I stay standing longer than five minutes, my back goes into spasms.
you chased him for over ten years, huh?
ten years, three months, 21 days.
most of it in the field, the rest of it behind a desk after Barbosa tried to kill me and failed.
he's recording this session, G.
look, Ness, the Navy's not doubting you.
in fact, we'd like your help.
you know this case isn't officially closed until we locate Barbosa's body, right?
my men were on site when he was killed.
I was following the op in real time and received pictures of his dead face from the scene, which I confirmed.
my keepsake.
does that give you closure?
after the car bomb, I woke up in a hospital bed in Mexico City.
told me I lost my leg. Then they told me about my wife.
I called Miguel Barbosa from my bed, and I told him, "I will never stop coming." Take my other leg.
take everything I have, pal.
but in the end, I'm gonna get you.
we'll keep in touch, Agent Ness.
you know where to find me.
thank you.
cowboy. - God, I love Mexico.
seriously, this place has got four of my favorite things.
it's got cheap beer, it's got great surf, it's got, obviously, beautiful women, it's got sombreros.
stay sexy.
no me gusta.
so, how are we supposed to recognize this, uh, police contact of ours?
his department didn't give us his name or the name of his high-value informant.
s. O.P. in cartel country. Thanks.
but he knows what we look like. Wow, that is fantastic.
kid's not so bad.
there's that word again-- "kid "
Deeks... - You really don't like them?
I didn't exactly have the ideal upbringing.
maybe I don't want to put a kid through that, too.
okay, you really want to do this?
you want to have the crappy-childhood contest with me?
you and I get to see how dark this world is getting on a daily basis.
why would I want to bring a child into that?
fair enough, but, you know, this isn't to be shocking, but you don't have to do it alone.
I mean, it takes two people.
and if you didn't know that, I could demonstrate for you.
I just need, like, a cape, some tequila.
agent Blye, Detective Deeks?
Sanchez, Tijuana PD.
Sanchez... how do you feel about children?
cops don't banter down here. - All right.
Barbosa may be dead, but we're still living in a war zone.
Where's your informant?
the kid? - His name is Javier. My team...
I'll get him. - Move!
moving!
get down!
exfil out the back door!
you got to get better groupies.
if I'd known this is what it took to get across the border,
I would have tried getting shot a long time ago.
relax, man, relax. What's your name, amigo?
Javier. And I probably speak better English than you, amigo.
no argument there.
I want a lawyer.
Yeah, might be one back at the cantina with those shooters.
we can always dump you back there, Javier.
listen, we're on your side, desperado.
then why can't I have a lawyer? - Because I said so.
did you just drop the "because I said so" bomb on him?
so, what if I did?
what do you mean,"What if I did? " What, are you gonna send him to his room next?
excuse me? - Take away his milk money?
why are you guys arguing? - We're not arguing.
we are having a discussion.
why don't you just work on that ten and two?
Oh, what? - Ten and two, ten and two.
yeah?
put your hands on the wheel.
lady's crazy, dude.
kind of reminds me of my mom.
listen, I know this is hard to believe, but I guarantee you're safer with us than you are anyplace else.
I never committed a crime. I never hurt anyone, I swear.
so why'd those guys come after you?
okay. Thank you.
NSA says there's been no Barbosa-related chatter.
everyone's laying low. Could mean something big's going down.
same with the Mexican Federales.
if somebody knows about the hit, nobody's talking.
what did you guys pick up on the singer?
his name is Javier Ramos.
and he's not just a singer. He's a cartel celebrity. A narcocorrida.
minstrels for the drug cartel.
they make music that glorifies criminals like Barbosa.
like folk singers for the Mexican underworld.
javier was Barbosa's personal songwriter and performer.
so who stands to gain by killing Javier?
well, this cartel had some problems.
Barbosa's right-hand man wanted to take over. Pedro Moreno.
their men were taking sides.
it was going to be civil war, but Barbosa was killed before it could start.
civil war would have been ugly.
may have been some Barbosa loyalists left,
Javier's songs glorified him.
those people in Mexico take their narco music seriously.
maybe seriously enough to turn Barbosa into a martyr.
Moreno killing Javier would be the final nail in Barbosa's coffin.
end his legacy forever.
you guys, go home. Get some sleep.
all right. Good night. - Thanks.
night. - Good night.
I don't know. What do you think?
I think we need to talk to Ahab again.
this has been a memorable adventure. Are we almost there yet?
he asked you that like ten minutes ago.
Yeah, welcome to my life.
maybe we can just pull over for like a half a second.
I think I saw a cactus with my name on it.
seriously, Deeks, again?
unless you want me to pee in a bottle... again.
all right. Enjoy. - Damn it.
look, I... I don't know why those guys wanted to kill me. Honest.
they didn't want to kill you. If they wanted to, you'd be dead. Okay?
they shot Detective Sanchez first.
and then they took shots at me and then my partner.
never you-- they wanted you alive.
she's right-- somebody wants an audience with you pretty bad, and I don't think it's to sing "Hava Nagila" at their kid's Bar Mitzvah.
I'm not a snitch.
okay. Fine. Don't say anything.
I was Miguel Barbosa's best friend.
here he is.
you guys mind making some room? - Sure.
Thanks.
how's it going?
you boys hungry? Kitchen makes a mean mac and cheese.
we're good, thanks.
Sean. Give me two orders of mac and cheese for my sailor friends here.
an attempt was made on Javier Ramos's life last night in Tijuana.
dance with the devil, you're gonna smell like brimstone.
javier was a cartel groupie
his songs make kids want to grow up with gold-plated A. K.'s.
Pedro Moreno was part of Barbosa's entourage, too.
they were about to go to war.
any reason you could think of that Moreno would want Javier to join Barbosa in the afterlife?
you first, Sam.
you're crazy. There's no way I'm putting this garbage in my body.
come on, eat up while I think. - I'm actually allergic to dairy.
Oh, since when? - Since... that thing.
what thing? - That thing. Allergic.
I have to pass. I'm gluten-free. - What the hell's gluten?
I'm pretty sure there's nothing gluten in there.
to answer your question, Barbosa was a megalomaniac.
which means the only reason Moreno would even go after Javier would be to...
ness? Ness. Agent Ness.
get a medic.
agent Ness!
I don't think this is a heart attack, G.
secure every exit-- no one leaves this building.
Yes, sir.
he's dead.
what do you got?
kitchen staff reported one missing cook's uniform.
security cams didn't catch any unauthorized visitors coming or going.
killer's a pro.
Yeah, forensics team says he was killed by an aconitine toxin.
Yeah, monkshood plant.
guns and knives in a federal building get assassins caught.
Vegetation... not so much.
well, with Ness dead, we only have one reliable Barbosa source left.
any chance of finding the leak or the stolen body, it's gonna come down to one guy.
narcocorrida. Javier.
ever heard of DEA Agent John Ness?
sure. He's Barbosa's worst nightmare.
he has this obsession with catching him.
had an obsession.
ness was killed inside his own office building less than a half hour ago.
poisoned, killer escaped.
ness is an expert on Barbosa.
I mean, that's kind of like you, right?
you don't think your cantina adventure and the Ness hit were connected?
I-I don't know.
someone's tying up Barbosa's loose ends. You're the last one left.
we just need a name, desperado.
okay, you want to talk about Barbosa's enemies inside the cartel
what about Pedro Moreno?
Moreno? He's just a psycho.
Barbosa was more than that.
I was singing for pesos on the street when he found me.
took me in, bought me a new guitar that same day.
he wanted me to sing "Happy Birthday" to his mother.
he even let me keep that guitar afterwards.
so, he discovered you?
nobody ever gave me anything before.
my dad was killed in a cartel crossfire when I was a little boy.
Barbosa took me in.
and you paid him back by singing narcocorridas that would make him a living legend in Mexico.
we'd talk about music for hours. His ideas for lyrics.
the things Barbosa had seen and done on his rise to the throne.
I heard his hopes, his dreams, his fears.
and you got another father.
I lost my father, too.
he was an amazing man.
my dad wasn't an amazing man.
he was actually kind of a terrible human being.
but that didn't mean that I didn't miss him in some weird way after he was gone.
and I think my point is that I understand what it's like to have conflicted emotions about your father.
Barbosa was a monster to most people.
nobody can ever replace a father, but he was who I had.
it feels like you're the first people I've ever met who get that.
it sounds like Kensi and Deeks are making some progress on Javier.
let's go.
not so fast, gentlemen.
here to put out fires, Hetty?
put out fires?
this is an inferno to make Dante Alighieri blush.
how bad's the fallout?
bad, very bad.
as a matter of fact, SECNAV and the DEA director want to hear your after-action report on Ness's murder.
SECNAV needs to know that we don't have that kind of time right now.
well, you can tell him yourself, Mr. Hanna.
he's upstairs right now.
SECNAV is on site? - On site and unhappy.
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
ms. Blye and Mr. Deeks will just have to wait for you.
that's okay. I-I'll go upstairs and debrief them.
go to the boatshed. I'll catch up.
I'm not gonna send you to the lions alone.
I work with Granger on a daily basis. Lions are just another day at the office.
go, Mr. Callen, before the inferno grows.
I'm good. - All right.
what was the last thing you remember discussing with Barbosa?
anything can help us, Javier.
lately he was obsessed with the idea of immortality.
living forever?
no. Being raised from the dead.
resurrection.
talk all night about the Savior's second coming.
was Barbosa a religious man?
no. He just liked the drama of it.
see, his enemies would think they killed him and sleep soundly that night.
and come morning, all the world would know that Miguel Barbosa rose from the grave and brought hell along with him.
sounds like a song.
it was. I called it "Resurrection.
when Barbosa heard it, he told me never play it for anybody else, ever again.
and why do you think he said that?
he was a great guy.
a little crazy, but...
he said it would ruin the surprise when he really did come back from the dead.
we'll be back.
you thinking what we're thinking?
Barbosa's alive.
you done with the debriefing? - Just getting started.
they gave me a break before we get back into it.
ness was in line for assistant directorship at the DEA.
they want to know every detail about his death.
Callen, Federales sent us photos of the Barbosa shoot-out.
throw it up.
we think Barbosa may have staged his own death.
now, Ness verified these photos, but he's been emotionally involved in the case for over ten years.
he could've gotten too close.
maybe he wanted Barbosa dead so bad he got tricked.
gaddafi and Saddam Hussein used look-alikes as decoys.
it's not like he doesn't have the resources.
Barbosa has a lot of money and a lot less overhead.
he had a limited window of time.
once officials ran the DNA and the prints on this body, they'd realize it wasn't the real deal.
so they steal the body from the morgue.
it's gotten to be so routine with the cartels that no one thinks twice about it.
why don't you reach out to the DEA and the CIA.
have them keep a close eye for any communications to Barbosa's family or his top lieutenants.
okay.
I got to get back. Keep me in the loop. - I will.
you are sorely missed. - I could always...
keep walking, Mr. Hanna.
Barbosa's alive, Hetty. This whole ruse makes total sense.
in a cartel power struggle, the smartest move would be for all his enemies to assume that he's deceased.
and it gives him the element of surprise to move against Moreno.
unfortunately, Moreno's not the only one
Barbosa hoped would let down his guard.
ness.
these guys are as brutal as the Chechens or the Serbians ever were.
I'm afraid it's more than brutality we have to be concerned with.
our next move has to be made with extreme care.
we'll find him. - We must.
otherwise, Agent Ness will have died for nothing.
the joke that Barbosa made to you about resurrection...
we don't think that was a joke.
you think it was Barbosa that sent someone after me in the cantina?
well, we don't know that for sure. Could've been Moreno.
if Barbosa's alive... he'll know I'm here.
I can't go back to México. Even here, I'm...
we can put you in a WITSEC program.
that's short for... - Witness Protection.
there's satellites in México. I've seen the shows.
you'd live under a new name, a new identity.
it'll be a new start.
but you can never contact your friends and family again.
so I guess that rules out a record deal.
look, this isn't as simple as me giving up my lifelong dream for guaranteed safety.
there are no guarantees.
Barbosa has people everywhere. And in everything.
you're absolutely right.
there have been cases where the program was compromised.
there is another option.
help us go after him.
if we get Barbosa, he'll be placed in Supermax:
哈维尔，
even the top criminals and terrorists in the world are pretty much powerless once they're inside.
so, that would be the end of it?
we're not gonna lie to you, Javier.
we all know there are no guarantees with cartels.
but... I like your odds a whole lot better.
and obviously going after Barbosa's gonna be risky.
and we're gonna have to put you in harm's way.
but you will never leave our sight.
I'll tell you what, why don't we give you, uh, some time to think about it.
I don't like this, Mr. Callen. I don't like it one bit.
trying to lure out Barbosa not only puts Javier's life in danger, but also Ms. Blye and Mr. Deeks.
if Javier agrees to do it-- and there's no guarantee that he will
this is our only chance at bringing down Barbosa.
bringing down Barbosa won't shut down the cartel's operation.
it just makes it easier for his rivals to take control.
and then it's back to business as usual.
exactly. You just made my point for me, Mr. Callen.
right. But... consider this, Hetty:
you could have said the same thing about the Mafia in New York City in the '80s.
but it took more than ten years of RICO indictments and much blood spilled on both sides.
and look at New York today. The Mob no longer has a stranglehold on the city.
Hetty, we have to keep at it.
people deserve the right to see their spouses off to work and their children off to school without worrying about them coming home in a body bag.
it's probably the most important decision of his life.
Yeah, we're gonna do everything we can to make sure he stays safe no matter what he chooses.
we can't hold ourselves responsible for the consequences of his decision.
Really?
what? It is his decision.
it's not like we weren't honest with him. He's not a kid.
Oh, please. I shudder at the thought of your decision-making skills when you were that age.
I'll have you know I was actually very mature for my age.
probably as mature as a drunken 20-something-year-old in a Girls Gone Wild video.
do you know those based on vicarious viewings or is it something much more first-hand?
bad example.
cause I got my credit card ready and the pause button...
Hey, moving on.
that's not much of a decision, if you ask me.
what do you mean?
going into WITSEC with Barbosa still at large?
most WITSEC cases go without incident.
Yeah, but those odds go way down when you're talking about Mexican drug cartel snitches.
okay, and what are his odds if we dangle him like a worm on a hook in front of a barracuda?
Yeah, I guess they both kind of suck.
Yeah, they both kind of do.
you think we pushed him too hard?
maybe.
guys. - What do you got, Eric?
word got out on the street that Javier's being taken to WITSEC.
you got that sweet silver Range Rover?
keeping back nicely.
Yeah, but he's been with us for the last three random turns that you've made.
I told you he's got people everywhere.
turn here.
good timing, Deeks.
I make a point of wearing my gold Rolex to my garbage man job.
get down!
stay down!
get down. Javier!
damn it! - Deeks!
he's gone!
Fuera.
look
Hello, Mr. Barbosa.
it seems rumors of your death have been greatly exaggerated.
looks like the undercover up with the garbage truck was a success.
let's not pat ourselves on the back just yet, Ms. Jones.
Mr. Barbosa may be alive, but I'm afraid Javier may not be for very much longer.
okay, Javier's GPS has them at 9th and Grand.
Kensi and Deeks are both in position.
Eric, we got one security camera facing the parking lot and one guy at the door.
we're heading to the fire escape. You ready? Go.
everything I know show us how good you've gotten.
maybe I can start singing that resurrection ballad now.
your humor translates well.
tell me, who was it that got you?
FBI? Homeland Security?
NCIS-- U. S. Navy.
but I didn't say anything to them.
no? - No.
I'm sure you said something.
hello.
Where's the bathroom?
can I get a coffee?
well, yeah, yeah, maybe a little bit, but I-I...
stop babbling.
do they know I'm alive?
no.
I didn't know you were alive. How could I tell them?
did I imply that you did?
would you tell them, had you known?
no.
it's not that I don't believe you, Javier.
it's just that sometimes, when people talk, maybe you say something you don't mean to.
with all the questions and the pressure, sometimes maybe a little something slips out.
maybe you don't realize it at the time or you forget because of all the, uh...
confusion? - Confusion.
no. No, I-I swear. I didn't say anything.
it's okay.
it's okay. It's okay.
it's okay.
no. Miguel! Miguel, we're friends!
we're... we're friends.
you are closer to me than anyone, Javier.
that's more than a man like me can afford.
no. No!
Mr. Beale? - A few technical difficulties.
well, I suggest you fix them now.
in coming - Ness? - Barbosa... I survived.
I'm never going to stop coming.
you could take my other leg.
you could take everything I got, pal.
but in the end, I'm going to get you.
you're dead. I'll finish the job myself, then spit on your wife's grave!
how is it that Ness is still alive?
you said the poison worked. Finish the job!
you son of a bitch. You're dead. You hear me?
I don't care how many times I have to kill you!
can you keep him on the phone, Mr. Beale?
I could only cut together so much of Callen and Ness's conversation before it became conspicuously repetitive.
where do we go, Eric?
you're looking for double doors.
two of his men are still with Barbosa and Javier.
Callen, you're about to get some company.
sorry that it's come to this.
Mr. Deeks, Ms. Blye, Javier is out of time.
shoot! Do it!
it was the only way, Javier.
I had to test your loyalty.
I was never going to kill you. You understand?
Javier, he's lying. That's what he does. You know that now.
no. You're like a son to me.
you know that.
you have to trust me. Okay? You trust me?
we're going to leave now, okay? Let's go.
sorry.
Javier, you did good.
you did good.
I got you.
was it the longest debrief ever?
one day somebody might offer me a desk job
if I accept it, you have permission to shoot me on sight.
done.
javier make it back to Mexico? - On his way now.
now that his singing career is over, it's a fresh new start.
why is it over?
Barbosa and his closest guys are dead, he's young and talented...
and his record label is a drug cartel.
he should be applying to colleges.
that's right, that's what I'm saying
he's got other options besides narcocorrido, you know what I mean?
I'm sure that Mexico has their own version of The Voice.
that's what you came up with?
I'll have you know that the winners end up broke a year later.
did you get a sitter? - No. Out of luck.
you're gonna have to take someone else to the Clippers game.
Where's Paris Summerskill these days?
she's in Des Moines.
I'll do it.
you will?
I'll do it.
what changed your mind? - Yeah, what changed your mind?
besides the fantasy of little Martys running to and fro.
God...
I don't know. Just helping Javier... it felt different.
felt good.
this... changes everything.
thank you, Kensi.
I do have one condition, though. - Name it.
Deeks helps me watch your kids. - What?!
look, I am taking a leap here with this babysitting thing.
it would be really nice to have my partner there to back me up.
that is, if he takes me up on it.
you want to play house?
they want to play house, Sam.
at your house, when you're not there.
Oh, yeah?
I have nanny cams. Everywhere.
that's okay,'cause I do some of my best work on camera.
Oh, thank you for an image I will never be able to get out of my head.
is that so wrong? I'm just getting it done.
they grow up so fast.
watch it!
what the hell did you do...
Oh, God.
you okay?
Yeah. Last night got a little rough.
Oh, really? Who?
is that the one who made your legs shake?
no, that was Griff.
all right, so tell me about Joshie.
Joshie, Joshie... Kind of over Joshie.
that quick? For one night only.
well, it's supposed to be fun and make you feel good, not wake up sore.
it's different for girls.
maybe you should go crawling back to Griff.
well, I will if he comes back around. I haven't had a repeat in six months.
I'm sorry, did I miss something?
who... who are these guys?
they're not guys, they're WODs. W-O-Ds?
what's that, like a BFF with an STD?
W-O-D is workout of the day. I started doing Cross Fit.
Why? - You got to try it. It's addictive.
so is meth. - Okay, listen.
you are tired. You are sore, you are miserable.
you are stretching muscles you didn't even know you had.
you are in a pool of sweat, and yet, all you can think about is doing it again as soon as possible.
and they name all these workouts after random guys?
no, actually the hero WODs are named after firefighters, soldiers, police officers, fallen heroes killed in the line of duty.
but, actually, you know what, the toughest ones are named after women-- Helen, Fran.
Fran, now that's a tough broad. For real.
fight Gone Bad. Filthy 50.
how about Lazy Sunday Morning?
watching a Football Game with a Cold Beer?
no pain, no gain.
if I'm gonna pay someone to hurt me, it better be a dominatrix.
Oh, do tell. - That was a joke. That was a joke.
I have noticed some unexplained bruising in the past. - Thank you.
yo, man, I don't judge. - Thank you.
whatever you want to do on your spare time is your business, as long as you don't ask me to spank you, we're all good.
great. - Ah, you like that?
mistress Henrietta awaits your arrival in the operations center.
those who are tardy will be subjected to severe punishment.
unless punishment is something you desire.
no, not you. - Sorry. Just role-playing.
Oh, I get it. The, uh, tech nerd can't play with the cool kids.
what?
man...
good morning, all. Miss Jones.
an hour ago Monica Davis was the intended target of a shooter in Hollywood.
nice little serpentine move.
Yeah, she's bobbing and weaving like she's used to getting shot at.
who is she?
miss Davis is a hostess at the Afrobeat nighclub N'Kosi.
why is someone trying to kill her?
we don't know.
and we weren't able to get a clear angle of his face.
we're not sure, but he may be involved with this man.
johannes Waaldt. He's the owner of N'Kosi, where Monica works.
he's also the face of several charities that build water purification systems in Africa.
am I missing something?
back in the day, Waaldt was quite the international arms dealer.
and that would be it.
that's Abdul Habaza.
the man who killed Moe.
from helicopters to rocket launchers,
JoJo was a one-stop shop until he became a legitimate businessman.
so what happened, Monica Davis saw something she wasn't supposed to see?
we're not sure. And we've lost contact with our man inside.
who's that?
Deeks? - Not Deeks. Max Gentry.
how long's he been working this?
this is a question for Assistant Director Granger.
apparently he set this up.
well, what is Deeks saying?
he hasn't checked in yet. We're still waiting for his call.
Oh, my God. That was crazy. That dude could've killed me.
Oh, you got that part, did you?
and then you squeal in like freaking Steve McQueen from Bullitt and I'm, like, get me the hell out of here.
and you're, like, bang, bang, bang, getting all Fast Five with it.
was that, like, insane, or what?
no, that wasn't like insane, that was actually insane.
I know, right, just feel my heart. Seriously, baby, feel my heart.
no.
why are you so mad?
cause you almost got yourself killed.
but you saved me.
you... are such a badass.
come on, baby, come here. - Don't, stop. Just stop.
just relax, Max. We got away; we're home free.
are you kidding me? Do you have any idea how much trouble you're in?
I'm not afraid of JoJo. - You should be.
honestly, I can't even believe you did this.
well, what did you expect me to do?
uh, maybe what I told you
you go in, you take some pictures. It was that simple.
but when opportunity knocks...
Yeah, well opportunity's about to kick open that door and shoot us both in the head.
somebody's about to kick in that door and shoot us both in the head.
Really? You joking? - You joking?
are you done?
Max... chill out.
you want to see them? - No, I don't.
Yes, you do. - No, I don't.
put them back. I don't want to see them. Don't...
Oh, I just dropped a Bentley.
can you please just give those to me? - Yeah.
just give... Don't put them down your...
are you... don't, you're gonna drop...
are you serious right now? You're dropping diamonds...
this was a terrible idea.
Deek's phone is still at his cover house.
all right, so why hasn't he checked in?
maybe he didn't have a chance yet.
Yeah, but he's got to know we saw the shooting.
if he was in trouble, he would've sent a distress.
not if he's injured or... dead.
I got him. Deeks sent an encrypted text.
did he say what the hell happened? - There's been a complication.
Yeah, we've gathered that. - What else?
that's it. - That's it?
it was a short text. More of a tweet.
he doesn't have a plan.
so what are we supposed to do, just sit around and wait until he comes up with one?
no. Sam and I are gonna head down to Waaldt's club and we're gonna find out who we're dealing with.
okay, what am I supposed to do?
back up your partner.
are there surveillance cameras at the cover house?
uh, no. But he's got an earwig.
we can send him a message, tell him to put it in.
do it. Send the address to my phone.
keep an eye on her. - Will do.
all right, you ready?
we can't go to a club dressed like this.
why not? The club's not even open yet.
Yeah, we still don't want to walk in there looking like a couple of hobos.
hobos? What is this, 1939?
Yeah, we got to look the part.
what, Hetty get you a new suit or something?
you got a new suit? - I'm due.
I'm due. Why didn't she get me a new suit?
maybe she wanted to surprise you.
Hetty? Am I, uh, getting a new suit?
not till you return the pants from the last one.
I told you I can't find them.
what is that? - It was Armani Prive.
I was under cover. Things happen.
G, you lost your pants.
even Deeks doesn't lose his pants. Come on.
we're lucky Deeks wears pants.
I got to tell you, Hetty sure outdid herself this time.
don't even start.
what, you don't think this is a sharp suit?
maybe it's because it's new.
do you remember before we were partners?
Yeah, what about it? - I miss those days.
yeah? Okay, Lone Wolf McQuade.
well, today, I'm an ex-running back, you're my agent, and we're here to rent the club for an NFL draft party.
how come I don't get to be the ex-player?
as what, a kicker?
quarterback. I'm taller than Doug Flutie, I'm mobile...
fine, fine. We'll try it your way. But I'd still make a great quarterback.
Yeah, just keep your pants on in there.
do you want the whole dance area?
Yeah. Yeah. We're gonna want the, uh, VIP room, and we're gonna buy out the whole bar.
great, we can also do specialty drinks.
I like it. This will work.
you getting all this, Eric? - Yeah.
Waaldt we already know.
okay, our shooter's name is Pieter Smit.
he's a South African native.
looks like he's worked security for everyone from Blackwater to drug cartels in Mexico and Bolivia.
who's the guy in the middle?
that is Noah Bernosoni. He's Swiss.
he's an international banker, most recently with Wahr Geld Bank.
uh, graduated from London School of Economics.
no criminal record.
all right, keep digging.
if he's dealing with Waaldt, he's probably into something dirty.
on it.
and the bar is fully stocked. and it's all top-shelf.
great. Well, good.
and we also provide the valet service until 1: 30.
anything later would have to be arranged beforehand.
appreciate you showing us around. - Thank you.
we'll be in touch. - Great.
thank you. - Thank you.
maybe I'll have the two biggest ones made into earrings. What do you think?
I think you should put them back in the bag before you lose them.
give them to me.
Oh, gotcha! Just like Richard Gere in Pretty Woman.
remember the jewelry box that he snaps shut? Chomp.
I love that movie. - Yeah, it was a classic.
want to take a shower? - No. No, I... don't.
well, suit yourself.
Oh, my God.
that's okay. I'll just get that-- that's fine.
I'm here to clean.
Oh, my God.
put
you're not going to run off with my diamonds, are you?
just take your shower.
last chance to join me.
Yeah, no, I'm more of a bath guy myself. But thank you.
Oh, that's romantic. I like that.
are you there, God, it's me, Margaret.
Judy Blume, really?
I got a softer side.
Yeah, it's called your head.
I missed you, too. - Not from what I've seen.
Oh, my God, are you jealous?
Oh, please, if you want to keep an operation secret, that is your business.
no, it wasn't a secret. It wasn't even an operation, all right?
Granger wanted info on Waaldt so I went to Waaldt's club.
I picked up his hostess and got her to look around for me-- that's it.
and just like that, she agreed to spy on her boss for you?
no, it took a little bit of persuading.
I hope you used protection. - It's not like that.
the truth of the matter is that Max Gentry can be incredibly charming when he wants to be.
maybe I should be partnered up with Max.
I didn't know she was going to go all Bonnie and Clyde on me.
so, where is Bonnie? - She's in the bedroom.
I'm surprised you're not with her. - You sound like her.
what? - Nothing.
what the hell is going on?
so I asked her to snoop around Waaldt's office. Guess what she found?
her panties?
meow, no not her panties. She found $10 million in diamonds.
who are you talking to?
I-I was... I wasn't.
I heard you.
no, no, I was talking to myself. That's how I figure things out.
you're so wound up. - I'm fine.
everything's gonna be okay. I promise.
you... you just need someone to take care of you.
and, baby...
...I'll take care of you.
how much we thinking?
well, it's hard to tell from the photos Deeks sent, but if they're real and there's no real reason to believe that they're not
I'm guessing $10 million, maybe more.
that's a lot of bling.
NCIS in Washington has seen a recent influx in blood diamonds.
they're untraceable, won't set off any metal detectors, and you can carry millions-worth in your pocket.
as long as they're real, no one cares where they came from.
our Red team has tracked blood diamonds from Sierra Leone to Antwerp where their county of origin papers are often forged.
other than Afghani heroin, blood diamonds have been the most consistent form of terrorist funding.
so the big question is what is Waaldt funding?
$10 million can fund a nice little coup.
I thought he was out of the business.
Granger must have had some suspicions to send Deeks in.
Where's Granger?
Oh, his office says he is unreachable.
you told them what happened?
ABSOLUTELY-- they said they would pass it along.
we got nothing on this guy.
well... his man Smit tried to kill Monica Davis in broad daylight.
some jump-off tried to steal $10 million in diamonds from me,
I'd off her in broad daylight, too.
that's good to know.
hypothetically speaking.
if I were a bad guy.
it's attempted murder. You bring him in, maybe he gives his boss up.
he's a violent dude. He's not the cooperative type.
which means we take a different tact.
which would be...?
something you don't need to know about.
hypothetically.
Kensi, you out there? I know you can hear me.
what?
where are you parked? - Down the street.
I can't even see you.
that's the whole point of surveillance.
Ah, well, I'm sorry you had to hear that.
I guarantee it sounded worse than it actually was.
who cares?
Oh, my God, I'm sure Sam doesn't act like this when Callen gets hit on.
act like what-- I'm just sitting here covering your ass.
not sure what she's doing with it.
so, we're cool then? - Why wouldn't we be cool?
we should go to Monaco, you know? Like James Bond in Casino Royale?
it's Montenegro.
you could get a tuxedo. And I'd get some hot dress.
and we'd be drinking champagne and playing roulette.
no wonder she likes you. She's delusional.
okay, first off, Casino Royale actually happened in Montenegro, and secondly we're not going anywhere until we sort this out.
Where's Montenegro?
Yeah, Deeks. Where's Montenegro?
it's in Europe. - You have no idea.
the beaches are topless.
look at that, she speaks Deeks. Match made in heaven.
we'll could get you a sexy little Speedo.
I'd pay to see that.
people would pay to see that. - I know I would.
tell her not to waste her money. It's too small a return on her investment.
what? What's so funny?
nothing, I was just I was laughing the joke that... you just told.
Oh, you never find my jokes funny, Maxi.
maybe that 'cause you aren't funny.
no, I do laugh at your jokes because you're very funny, you say clever things that are very funny.
it's my phone.
it's Waaldt. - Don't answer that.
why not? - Because he can use that to trace us here.
you're getting paranoid. - Don't answer the phone!
Hello?
not the brightest Barbie in the toy box, is she?
okay, that doesn't even make any sense.
no, no, you listen. Yeah, I've got them, and if you want them back, you're gonna have to pay for them.
I'm not afraid of you.
whatever.
Hells, yeah, did you hear that?
I heard it. - I definitely heard it.
did I sound like I meant business?
sounded like she just signed her own death warrant.
antagonizing him isn't gonna help anything.
screw him. Why are you acting so weird?
I'm not. - Are you getting cold feet?
because if you are, it's a little late for that.
I mean, you knew Waaldt had diamonds.
I didn't know he had diamonds.
that's why you wanted me to snoop around. Don't pretend it's not.
no, it wasn't.
no, you wanted to know where they were so that you could steal them.
but I stole them for you.
you should be happy.
and you should be thanking me.
you and I... are gonna live happily ever after in luxury.
clearly delusional.
so, I'm gonna get changed, and you and I can go out and celebrate.
we're not gonna go out and celebrate.
Yes, we are. - No, we're not.
celebrate. Celebrate. - Put your paws down.
Oh, my God. Please help me.
you brought it on yourself, Maxi.
you're not helping. You are not helping.
are you hungry? - No. Keep eating your bonbons.
no origami today? - No. And stop littering my dash.
you're hungry.
I know hypoglycemic-induced hostility when I see it.
I'm just thinking. - About what?
you want to know what I was thinking? - About eating?
I was thinking about Wakanda.
what is that, a camp in Wisconsin?
seeing Abdul Habaza's picture reminded me of Moe and Jada, the time I spent in Chad and Sudan.
I started thinking about Wakanda.
where is Wakanda?
it's nowhere. It's a fictional African country.
the most technically advanced society in the Marvel Universe. And the richest.
hold on a second. In a comic book?
you just geeked out on me in a real moment?
Hey, man, when I was a kid, comic books were the only thing that made sense.
it was simple-- good guys versus bad guys.
for me it was all about T'Challa, the Black Panther.
of course.
not just 'cause he was a brother who was richer than Tony Stark.
T'Challa was a leader, he was a president, he was a superhero all at the same time.
he was all about justice.
when I left Brooklyn, the only thing I wanted to see was the motherland and-and to witness that world up close.
but instead of finding Wakanda,
I found poverty, starvation, child soldiers, death squads.
Waaldt's bread and butter.
I thought I could save Moe.
I really thought I could help Jada.
that whole motherland thing's overrated.
I mean, look at me. I come from a line of blood-feuding gypsies who keep trying to kill me.
how's that justice?
there's our goal.
you ready, T'Challa?
see, I knew I shouldn't have said that to you.
I always regret it when I tell you things.
I know you do.
can I bum a smoke?
Thanks.
got a light?
what kind of a smoker doesn't have a lighter?
I'm trying to quit. Don't move.
you have no idea who you're dealing with.
Pieter Smit. Born December 19, 1972, Kroonstad, South Africa.
mother was Mary, father was also Peter.
you served in... - What do you want?
we just want to talk. - Not interested.
well, we can do this the easy way or we can do it the hard way.
go to hell.
that would be the hard way.
Waaldt should've called back by now.
you don't have to yell. - I'm not talking to you.
stay in the bedroom. I'm closing this. Stay in the bedroom.
Kens, somebody's here.
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
who are you? - Kelly Lang, neighborhood watch.
we've gotten reports concerning some suspicious and lewd behavior coming from this residence.
she's in the bedroom.
Oh, where she does some of her finest work, I'm sure.
thank God. She's gonna hear you.
good!
Callen and Sam have the guy that tried to kill you both.
they think she might help turn him, and if Waaldt's traced her phone, the safe house is no longer safe.
God, I hate this part.
what, the part where you have to say everything was a lie?
that you're a big fat liar? That part?
don't do that. Don't gloat.
I'm not gloating. - You're gloating a little bit.
I wasn't gloating. - It's a little unbecoming, actually.
where is she?
no.
should have seen that coming.
if I had known we were going swimming, I would have packed my swimming trunks.
you're funny. He's funny.
I don't think he's funny.
don't take that personally. He's only happy if he's hurting somebody.
good cop, bad cop? That's the best you got?
I don't know. I mean, those are two of our better routines.
what else do we have?
we have the girl he tried to kill. - We have the girl.
which one? There's been a couple got away, but not many.
now that's funny.
no? Tough audience.
I'll tell you what else we have.
we have... your boss's diamonds.
Congratulations.
hang out. We'll get more acquainted later.
what do you got, Eric?
okay, it's all good, but Monica Davis escaped.
how? - Out a window, I think.
and she's got the diamonds.
and this is all good because...?
because we're tracking her cell phone and Kensi and Deeks are following her.
she make any calls? - Not yet.
keep it that way. Don't let her receive any incoming either.
let us know if Waaldt tries to reach her again.
I'm on it. - Any word from Granger?
Nope.
of course not. Keep us informed.
will do.
Eric, how far now?
uh, she's about half a block ahead of you on the left.
she's not moving.
I can't believe she double-crossed me.
Yeah, just when you were about to live your life happily ever after in luxury. She played you.
she's actually not that bad. She just...
has poor judgment? - Exactly.
like her taste in men. - Oh, see?
see, what you tried to do right there, but it's not gonna work 'cause she wasn't actually involved with me.
she was involved with my alter ego Max Gentry.
hang on a second. Not your undercover legend?
you know, that's what I meant.
no, no, no, you said alter ego. That's completely different.
superheroes have alter egos.
no, no, superheroes have secret identities.
schizophrenics have alter egos, like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
or you when you haven't had chocolate or during your lady phase.
shut up.
Ooh, speaking of crazy women.
all right, stay here. - Why am I staying here?
um, maybe because if she sees you she's gonna want to run again like most women.
except for you. You don't run from me.
that's because I carry a gun. Now make yourself useful and back me up.
I'll just be here holding your purse.
Eric, call Monica's phone. - On it.
yeah? Hello? Hello?
I think they hung up.
NCIS. - What?
too many letters? Federal agent.
back off, bitch. I mean it.
Freeze!
Max, what are you doing? Shoot her!
sorry, honey, he's with me.
and his real name is Marty Deeks, and he's a cop, and he's my partner.
who's the bitch now?
he is.
can't argue with that.
aren't you even a little bit curious as to why we brought you here?
I'm assuming it's to kill me.
that's just defeatist.
what was your boss gonna do with the diamonds?
a tiara.
I think you got a smirk out of him.
it was subtle. I mean, you'd have to know him better to see it, but...
look, I'm not gonna kill you. He might, but I won't.
I don't even care about the diamonds.
I just want to know what they were being used for.
ask my boss.
I would, but he's not here, you are.
and I'm not telling you anything, so you might as well go ahead and drown me.
we're not gonna drown you. No, he still has to feed the fish.
did you see that? He smiled. Now he's happy. Finally.
okay. I guess I'll get some lunch. What are you thinking, fish tacos?
I'm not hungry. - Still?
how about you? - He shouldn't eat.
okay. All right, you let me know when you're all done.
he was brokering a deal.
I'm sorry?
Waaldt was brokering a deal. The diamonds were payment.
for what? - I don't know.
who's the buyer? - I don't know.
is it Bernosoni? The guy from the club today?
no. Bernosoni was negotiating for the seller.
who's the seller? - I don't know.
you don't know much, do you?
I know he was Russian.
a Russian is selling something for $10 million?
how do you know the seller was Russian?
because he was speaking in Russian.
when? - A few weeks ago he came by the club one time.
you saw him?
yeah... I saw him.
the Russian you saw with Bernosoni... he one of these guys?
that one.
that's him.
what kind of police station is this? - The kind you don't ask about. Sit!
seriously, you're not gonna say anything?
I got nothing to say.
Yeah. - Yeah.
what's he doing here? - Same thing you are.
next time I won't miss. - Shut up and keep moving.
the diamonds she stole were to broker a deal with Isaak Sidorov.
are you kidding me? - Who's the buyer?
smit doesn't know.
well, did anybody recognize Sam as David Forman or mention Quinn?
no. Their covers are intact.
picked Sidorov out of a photo array.
said Sidorov meet face-to-face with his boss, Waaldt.
holy crap, this is huge. - Okay, so what do we do now?
we make a plan... and fast.
johannes Waaldt was brokering a deal with Bernosoni using $10-million worth of blood diamonds
I'd bet more like $12 million.
what's a couple of million dollars amongst friends, huh?
you know, by now, he must be wondering where Smit is.
maybe we can convince Waaldt that Smit and Monica stole the diamonds together.
I know somebody that can make that story stick.
you think she'll play ball?
she won't want to, but she'll do it.
I told you things I never told anybody else.
we did things I never did with anybody else.
I'm sorry, but that wasn't me. That was Max.
I risked my life for you.
I never asked you to steal the diamonds.
well, you took advantage of me.
as I recall, you're the one that tried to rip me off.
I thought you were getting cold feet.
I was doing that for us.
just to be perfectly clear, I never forced you to do anything.
keep telling yourself that.
so what now?
so what now is, you have a choice.
this is your third strike. Yeah?
and you stole millions of dollars of merchandise, you assaulted a federal officer.
and with your record, you're looking at 25 to life.
Oh, just cut to the chase. Just tell me the truth for once.
work with us.
help us make the diamond exchange with Waaldt.
and if it leads to his arrest, and the arrest of Sidorov, you get to walk away free.
that's it? - It's that simple.
Oh, screw simple. What about a reward for the diamonds?
I mean, they got to be worth something.
God bless you. Always the hustler.
Yeah, takes one to know one. - Fair enough.
why should I believe a word you say?
cause I'm the one telling you, not Max.
Yeah.
and your imaginary friend, Max Gentry, absolves you of all guilt.
it wasn't me, it was Max.
so lucky to have a friend like Max.
are you done?
Yeah.
so what's it gonna be, Monica?
what do I have to do?
call Waaldt. You tell him it was Smit's idea, and he tried to kill you, he tried to double-cross you, and now you're scared.
you tell him you have the diamonds, and you'll give them back for $100, 000 in cash.
give him an hour to meet you at the LA Music Center with the cash, or you'll find another buyer.
don't suppose I get to keep the cash after we're done?
what do you think?
you can tell your buddies I'm in.
but I'm asking Waaldt for $250, 000.
I might be scared, but I'm not stupid.
love it.
she's all yours.
Kensi... Let him go.
you're up, Kens.
tuck.
you know, you have a pretty sweet right cross.
Thanks. I can tell you've studied Krav Maga.
you know, I used to have a thing for buff Israeli guys.
you know what I was thinking? - What?
that you and I should take off with the diamonds.
we'd make a pretty sexy team, and no one would mess with us.
and I'd cut you in for half.
that was a joke.
so...
I got Max Gentry, but you get the real deal.
how's that? - Deeks is my partner.
and that's it? - That's enough.
is it?
you know you can't trust him.
I trust him with everything.
you're a bigger fool than I thought.
everything he did, he did it to establish his cover.
a cover that saved you, and that will save a lot of other lives.
I'm not worried about the past. Any of it.
I mean, why would you be? You're just his partner, right?
Bye. Good luck out there.
any sign of Waaldt? - I got nothing.
Nope. - Nope.
Eric? - Nothing yet.
and Waaldt's phone is turned off, so we have no idea where he is.
he's coming around the fountain. He's got a briefcase.
is that my money?
blunt and crass. What should I expect from a waitress?
I was a hostess.
you put the "ho" in hostess. And now you're a thief.
it takes one to know one.
Ooh, clever. Where are my diamonds?
okay, that's enough. Hey, hey.
don't tell me you're gonna count that. - No, I trust you.
something I'll never do again.
I'm not here alone.
neither am I.
gun! - Monica!
Freeze!
I got him! - Monica! Monica!
stay down.
you're okay. You're okay, just breathe. Just breathe.
I would have been better off with Max.
Eric, I'm gonna need two ambulances.
Hey, you're still here. - Yeah.
how come?
I, uh... couldn't find you. You didn't pick up your phone.
must have left it in my car.
Hetty wanted me to give you this.
okay.
how's Monica?
she's sore. Obviously lucky.
how's Waaldt?
Waaldt lawyered up in the ambulance, and he hasn't said a word.
literally, a word.
well, maybe he'll change his mind. - Yeah, who knows.
so, I was... - Listen, I...
sorry, go ahead, I wasn't... - No, please.
I was just gonna see if you were good.
Yeah. You?
I mean, I'm good if you're good.
I'm good.
okay. Good. We're good.
which is, you know... great.
glad we cleared that up.
see you tomorrow.
sunshine and gunpowder.
think they bought it?
I did.
that's fairly obvious.
for your information, that's my knee.
whatever.
you can get off me now.
it's only been ten minutes.
I have a reputation to protect.
we're not even sure if we're under surveillance yet, Tony.
you can't be too careful when you're undercover.
let's give it another 40 minutes just to be realistic.
realistic, huh? Mm-hmm.
in that case...
I prefer it on top.
I can live with that.
what was that for?
because that was definitely not your knee.
mm, she's very beautiful, Jethro.
her name's Sophie Ranier.
she's murdered over 25 people, Duck.
and her friend?
her husband
both Canadian citizens.
both contract assassins.
she suffered extensive injuries.
it may take quite a while to determine the actual cause of death.
they were killed in a car accident two days ago outside of Kuwait International Airport.
there's the accident report.
I'm assuming this is urgent.
I've waited three months to see Giselle.
Yeah, apologies about the girlfriend, doc, but I do need you...
Giselle's a ballet.
you really should get out of your basement more, Jethro.
we need to know everything we can about these two, Ducky.
why is NCIS investigating this?
marine CID found two fake U. S. passports and two first-class tickets for Washington, DC, in their luggage.
they have reservations at the Barclay through November 10.
marine Corps birthday.
they're holding the ball there.
hosted by the commandant of the Marine Corps.
our top military leaders congressmen, and agency directors will be there.
including me.
Tony and Ziva have taken their room reservations at the Barclay.
they're there now pretending to be these two.
they're working blind, Duck.
we're counting on you to fill them in on some of the more personal details of our couple.
though it may be common knowledge that I talk to my patients, unfortunately, to date, none of them have ever answered me back.
listen harder.
sweetheart, you know what I could really use right now?
some deodorant?
I was thinking more along the lines of a back massage.
good idea.
why don't you roll over like a good boy.
and to think my mother thought I was too good for you.
What'd I miss?
they had sex.
they have any contact with anyone yet?
just each other.
multiple times.
was it good for you?
wait. Someone's knocking at their door.
who is it?
room service.
room service.
compliments of the hotel management.
Gibbs wants me to sweep the room for bugs...
place some of our own.
and he also wants to talk to you.
you can put it over there, please.
very good, madam.
Garcon, we'd like some extra bath towels.
of course.
just checking to make sure everything's in order.
Oh, that won't be necessary.
Oh, and can you check the minibar?
I'd like it restocked with Redull.
red Bull.
that'll keep you up all night, madam.
exactly.
please accept this assortment of cheeses, compliments of the hotel.
what's wrong?
room service put a tray on our microphone.
you know what that means.
we're screwed?
Nope. You get to dress up as a maid, Maya.
if you whisper, it should be okay.
comfortable, DiNozzo?
well, yeah, working on it. Why do you ask?
we're looking at you, Agent DiNozzo.
all of you.
uh, sorry about that.
DiNozzo, what the hell are you doing?
you're married assassins.
you're not visiting the Playboy mansion.
it was kind of Ziva's idea, boss.
incoming call.
have her answer it.
sweet cheeks, do you think you could go over and answer the phone for me while I pour us some champagne?
Thanks, honey.
Yes.
there's a cell phone in the Bible next to your bed.
got it.
keep it with you at all times.
you have dinner reservations at the hotel dining room at 9: 00.
don't be late.
the concierge.
we were able to get into the dining room after all...
my love.
it looks like I'm getting dressed up for you tonight.
that wasn't the concierge.
that was their contact.
we're on the move.
let's go. We've got to get dressed for dinner.
I'm going.
don't look at me that way, Gibbs.
it was league night when I got your 911.
I was two frames away from a perfect score.
and just for the record, these stupid outfits were not my idea.
I like it.
is is kind of cute, huh?
no sign of Mr. Palmer, I suppose?
not since this afternoon, Ducky.
ABS, these are their personal effects.
get yourself wired so you can feed whatever you find directly to DiNozzo and David.
looking for anything in particular?
Yeah, anything that will help those two act like them.
solid on the visuals, Tony.
there's quite a crowd here tonight.
see anyone you know, sweet cheeks?
not yet.
but the night's just getting started, my little hairy butt.
ABS. I'm loading the photos into the computer.
duck, you got any scoop for our married couple?
I have the breakdown of the contents of their stomachs and intestines.
if Mr. Ranier had lived,
I would have suggested a more fiber-rich diet.
his colon was almost impacted with fecal material.
you think it's too late to order a salad?
good evening.
table for two?
I believe our food is here now.
thank you.
report.
got the restaurant covered from the entrance, boss.
I'm a meat and potatoes kind of guy.
Tony, the calluses on Mr. Ranier's hand suggest he was left-handed.
switch hands, DiNozzo.
this is nice, isn't it?
Yeah, a quiet little dinner, just the six of us.
our friend is calling.
ABS, I want that number.
got it.
starting a reverse search directory now.
I'm glad you called.
we were getting bored.
thought it would help to see your target in person tonight.
he's here?
you don't see him?
relax.
I've been flying for over 20 hours.
and the restaurant's packed. We will.
talk to me, Abs.
he's calling from a pay phone.
the address is coming up.
you didn't mention anything about being surrounded by U. S. Marines.
it's too dangerous for the sum you're paying us.
accomplish your mission, and we'll discuss more.
but you won't pay us more.
got it!
2205 M Street.
he's calling from a pay phone inside the restaurant.
DiNozzo, McGee! Already moving.
I have to go to the little boy's room.
I have to talk to my boss.
do that. We'll wait for you to...
he hung up.
don't move. Federal agent.
it's me, Probie. He's gone.
must have slipped out through the kitchen.
I didn't even get a look.
want us back in the squad room, boss?
no, I want you and Ziva back in your room maintaining your cover.
Oh. All night?
do I stutter or something, DiNozzo?
afraid I'll bite, Tony?
the name is Jean-Paul, Sophie.
Hey, Abs, what do you got?
I have a "whoopee" and I have a "but."
Whoopee-- I got a photo of the man that Tony and Ziva are going to assassinate
But?
but...
I have no idea which of these 32 photos is him.
what makes you think the target's a male?
did you forget I'll be there?
no, whoever set up the hit referred to the caller as a man.
you made contact?
Ziva got a pay phone call.
you trace it?
gee, why didn't I think of that?
sorry, Jethro. I'm a little tired.
Yeah, well, you never could pace yourself very well.
I have one word for you, Jethro.
Mm?
Positano.
come on.
that was a week after I took a bullet.
where did the call originate?
pay phone, the hotel.
we got there, the guy was gone.
at least we know he's here keeping tabs on the operation.
Abby's matching these photos with reservations in the restaurant.
she'll check the names against invites to the ball.
it'll narrow the target.
what if the hit has nothing to do with the ball?
someone who's a guest at the hotel?
Ziva told him she didn't know the target would be surrounded by Marines.
and he wasn't surprised.
no.
Hey, nothing's going to happen tonight.
Tony and Ziva are hitting the rack, all the backup teams are in place around the hotel.
why don't you go grab 40 on the couch in your office?
no, I just need a little coffee.
yeah? When the caffeine jolt ends?
I'll do what you do.
get a refill.
you're not me.
chauvinist.
Yeah.
yeah... I guess.
good night, Jen.
Uh-huh?
need to boce something off you.
okay, shoot.
my director side is telling me flood that hotel with security and notify the FBI of a potential terrorist attack.
my agent side?
if I do that, we lose the chance to take down an enemy cell operating inside the capital.
they'll scatter.
of course, you'd stay the course, trust your people to get the job done.
you telling me what I'd do?
asking.
if I was director, I'd give my people another 24.
they can't get the job done,
I'd notify the FBI.
you'd really do that?
Nah. But that's why I'll never be director.
the man snores like a drunken sailor.
well, we won't have to listen much longer.
he saw their target at the restaurant.
we're on plan.
watched the videotape of their session this afternoon, Maya.
it was pretty hot stuff.
these two really know how to live their life.
you, uh, you ever think about that maybe...?
forget it. We're here on a mission, period.
you want something more than coffee, call room service.
Oh, my God.
Ziva? Shh...
come on, you're killing me here.
what?
nothing. I thought I heard something.
crazy chick.
I heard that, my little hairy butt.
morning, boss.
thank you.
Hey, boss, this was sitting on my front porch this morning.
what is it?
it's a package addressed to Ziva.
well, yeah, I can see that, McGee.
what is in it?
wasn't sure if I should open it.
that's probably why she's using you as her mule.
sunglasses.
with different lenses?
Why?
to protect her eyes?
you know, I'm going to ask her.
I'm going to find out.
Yeah, good idea, McGee.
give them their wake-up call.
Tony? Mm.
Hey, DiNozzo!
this is great.
they're sleeping in a five-star hotel, I'm a waiter.
want to trade places, McGee?
you're awake.
since 5:00.
he snores.
I've got a package here for you.
my shades.
can you bring them up with breakfast?
sure. Gibbs wants Tony up, too.
huh, my pleasure.
Jean-Paul, my little furry bear.
wake up, Cheri.
I'm in position, boss!
make the stitches precise, Mr. Palmer.
uh, yes, Doctor.
and when you're done, I want the supply locker inventoried and cleaned.
I, uh, actually, already did that, Doctor.
then do it again.
what have we found out, Duck?
that my assistant, Mr. Palmer here, should keep his cell phone with him and turned on at all times.
what can you tell me about our assassins?
Mr. Ranier here had his appendix removed,
Mrs. had her left wrist broken as a child.
we did, however, find some rather curious markings.
markings?
well, tattoos might be the more appropriate word.
almost invisible to the naked eye.
on the inside of the fourth digit of both of their left hands.
or the sign for infinity.
some kind of terrorist cell I. D?
on their ring fingers.
perhaps it means "love forever."
you know, I want to take another look at the X rays, make sure I didn't miss anything else.
Yeah, do it.
missed a stitch there, Palmer.
we really should take you to see the doctor, sweet cheeks.
Why's that?
because you snore like a drunken sailor with emphysema.
look who's calling the pot black.
kettle. Pot is calling the kettle black.
Oh, I'd really like some music.
something with a little beat, dear?
sorry.
what do we got?
mm, sneaky people.
top floor, northwest corner, Gibbs.
they have a laser trained on our room.
I can't believe that your sunglasses can detect different light spectrums.
Ziva, that is amazing.
DiNozzo, we're going to need a diversion.
I think we can manage something, boss.
let's roll, McGee.
Ziva, that is amazing.
big whoop, she has spy glasses.
anyone can do that. That's not amazing.
you realize we can still hear you, right, Abby?
I think I'm going to need a cold shower after this.
disgusting.
give me those binoculars.
I don't know how much longer I can keep this up, boss.
we're in position, DiNozzo.
give it the big finish.
we could make a fortune with this off the Internet.
they're serial killers, Yussif.
I wouldn't recommend trying.
NCIS! FBI, freeze!
I got a whole new respect for NCIS, Agent McGee.
you guys are hard-core.
Ah, we got lucky.
it's actually the trained laser on the room that gave you away.
we were talking about your agents pretending to be married assassins.
very convincing.
I don't think anyone in the FBI would actually go all the way just to sell a cover story.
I would.
guys, they were acting.
trust me...
I know when someone's acting when they're having sex.
it's true
I've meet his wife.
well, Tony and Ziva wouldn't.
...Unusual for men to like love stories.
how do I explain to the director of the FBI that we're running an undercover op in his jurisdiction without informing him.
with a smile.
it's not funny, Gibbs.
they had intel that two assassins were going to hit a target at the Marine Corps Birthday Ball.
did you get that memo?
no.
why didn't I think of that?
because you're exhausted.
I told you-- get some sleep.
and do that before you take on the director of the FBI.
I can't, Jethro.
I can fix this.
how?
you're not the only one around here knows how to play politics.
you're not serious.
your idea of politics usually involves some form of physical violence.
well, you know what they say, Jen...
can't make an omelet unless you break a few eggs.
are we free to go now?
not yet.
what the hell's NCIS doing... Our job, Fornell.
Yeah, that involve jeopardizing our operation?
you're damn lucky we didn't blow these two away.
which wouldn't have happened if you hadn't strayed into our jurisdiction!
conference room... now!
so anxious to play with the big boys...
Really? Big boys, my ass!
Yeah, this is going to be ugly.
Oh, yeah. Fornell hasn't been this upset since...
the last time we saw him.
gum?
the big boys?
we really screwed this one up.
Oh, you think, Tobias?
the question is, how do we fix it without our directors getting into a world-class pissing match?
joint op.
who's lead?
my team's already in place.
did you find out who hired them?
not yet. Working on it.
I need more than that for my tap dance at the Hoover Building.
give us 24 hours, then we flip.
I gets operational control?
Yeah, and credit for the collar.
agreed.
directors get to save face and we...
get the job done.
and people say we're bastards?
only because they know us.
I've got the I. D.'s on the people in the restaurant who have invites to the Marine Corps Ball, madam.
uh, Abby.
sorry.
make sure Tony and Ziva get them.
okay. Should I also check restaurant staff, too?
international assassins hired to take out a waiter?
I was just trying to be thorough.
no...
it's good.
good instincts, Chip. Run them.
okay.
Hey, Abby, can I ask you a question?
Yes.
why don't you like Officer David?
what makes you think I don't like her?
uh, I found this.
Oh... that.
I understand.
I have the same problem with DiNozzo.
Tony is a great guy.
you just have to get to know him.
Yeah, well, you don't know him like I do.
he always gives new people grief.
he learned that from Gibbs.
okay, quiz time.
what's your take on Sophie Ranier's blood test?
well, she's got elevated levels of human chorionic gonadotropin.
which means?
she's pregnant?
good, Chip. She's pregnant.
who's pregnant?
Ziva... well, not Ziva, Ziva, but Sophie Ranier, our dead hit girl.
she's got a bun in the oven.
like what you see, Agent DiNozzo?
you're room's clean except for the listening devices we installed.
we're free to talk.
Yeah.
so... you're the one who's been watching us?
Oh, yeah.
when this is over, we really should go out for drinks.
I-I'd like that.
I'm pregnant, Tony.
maybe some other time.
she was... she was kidding.
something wrong?
Thanks.
Oh, she's really not your type anyway.
hot... and in a maid's outfit.
they don't get any more my type.
he's learning.
number's blocked.
talk to me.
I've been told to negotiate a price commensurate with the risk.
I'm listening.
not on the phone.
be in the lobby in exactly one hour.
a black Lincoln will be waiting out front.
make sure you're not followed.
in position, boss.
your people set, Tobias?
got four unmarked vehicles standing by.
we'll be able to follow them wherever they go.
Tony, Ziva... get ready to roll.
hour's almost up.
Roger that, boss.
you haven't fired your weapon, so it's already clean.
it calms my mind.
it forces me to stay focused at the job in my hand
the term's "job at hand."
same difference.
something wrong?
just trying to picture you pregnant.
don't.
I have to.
I'm going to be a father.
it's a great responsibility.
maybe it's not yours.
maybe she didn't know.
Oh, she knew.
so, why take this contract?
put her unborn child in danger?
perhaps we needed the money.
kids are expensive.
and bullets are cheap.
there's a big chance this meeting is a set-up, Tony.
you scared?
no.
excited.
no sign of the Lincoln yet.
that's a solid copy, McGee.
we're sending them down.
all mobile units, prepare to roll on my mark.
th reminds me of our operation in the former Czech Republic.
you took a round in the thigh.
I had the same bad feeling before that operation, too.
we're on our way to the elevator, boss.
we're not taking any chances on this one.
first sign it goes bad, you call it.
hold the door.
Thanks.
sure.
sweetheart...
okay, black Lincoln just pulled up.
Yeah, got a visual on that, McGee.
got a match. Abby!
man and a woman just got out.
heading into the hotel.
car's leaving.
I can see that, McGee.
all units, hold your positions.
that's not our Lincoln.
the waiter's got a warrant out on him.
for what?
you're getting off here.
not a wise choice, Mr. and Mrs. Ranier.
weapons.
we would've come to the third floor ourselves.
three armed escorts seems a bit excessive.
very good.
our location and our number in two sentences.
it's too bad your friends can't hear you.
you're being jammed.
bring them to my room.
if they resist...
...Shoot the woman.
come on, let's go.
Tony, Ziva, do you copy?
DiNozzo, I said, do you copy?
what the hell is going on there?
boss, they're not in the room.
they never arrived in the lobby.
my teams have the entire outside of the building covered.
they didn't leave the hotel, Gibbs.
last contact was at the elevator
that was 11 floors they could've gotten off at.
11 floors, McGee.
how many rooms we looking at?
um, well, if we don't count individual bathrooms and, uh, closets... McGee!
264 hotel rooms, 22 utility rooms.
they haven't checked in because they can't.
they're at the meet right now?
they removed their earwigs and they dumped their communication when it was changed to the hotel.
we go room by room. My people seal off...
no. We wait.
what for?
for Ziva to contact us.
we move now, we blow their cover,
and if their cover is already blown, Director?
there are two things you should be painfully aware of right now.
one...
no one leaves this business.
and two, never threaten the people who employ you.
should I be writing this down?
I take that as a "no."
Where's the disk?
what disk?
where, Mrs. Ranier?
what makes you think we have it?
we spotted your backup at the restaurant.
on some level, you must have known this was gonna happen.
hm, observant.
how much is our disk worth to you?
I have a better question.
what's it worth to you?
it's bad, Gibbs.
it's very, very bad.
remember when we missed nabbing the guy in the restaurant? Mm-hmm.
well, Tony said he didn't see anything, but the eye sees more than we think it does.
it's the brain that misses stuff-- it has to do with the firing of the optic nerve and the visual cortex...
you found something from Tony's camera.
well, I went to the feed, frame by frame.
now, Tony is looking at the pay phone, because that's where he thinks the target is.
but a camera doesn't think, it just records.
so when he runs past the kitchen door of the restaurant, we got... this.
our bad guy.
run it. I want a name.
I do. I did.
he's a contract assassin, Gibbs.
he's wanted in more than five countries.
it doesn't make any sense.
why would a killer hire other killers to do a hit for him?
out of professional courtesy, I've had Mr. Cord go lightly on your husband.
and I appreciate that.
unfortunately, we're running out of time.
if you let him go, I'll tell you where the disk is.
you'll tell me either way, Mrs. Ranier.
why don't you two take a moment...
...consider your options.
I might have a plan. What?
the Raniers obviously stole something they want, and you're gonna give it to them.
we don't have it.
you're gonna tell them it's in our hotel room, the only way they'll find it is if you show them.
McGee should be waiting for us in there.
good plan- except for one minor drawback.
what?
when I leave, they'll most likely put a bullet through your head.
Oh. Well, I didn't say it was a perfect plan.
two centimeters below the supra-orbital notch.
what do you make of it, Mr. Palmer?
I originally assumed it was a speck of dirt on the exposure.
it appears to be a heart?
Yes.
rather a strange place to find one.
don't you agree?
it appears to be gold, surgically embedded in the conjunctival layer.
perhaps some type of body jewelry?
jewelry embedded in an eye?
Oh, yes, you'd be amazed what people do to themselves.
to Abby, please.
I doubt anyone would notice your little gold heart unless they knew it was there.
staring into your eyes, face to face...
like a lover.
I found a chip in it.
flash memory embedded underneath, sir.
500-megabyte capacity, 50 MPS throughout.
translation?
it contains the Raniers' personal data in two files.
one has a list of numbered bank accounts, a deed for a restaurant, a house in Gilead, Maine.
we also ran the address-- the phone service and cable are scheduled to be turned on next week, sir.
sounds like a retirement plan. She was pregnant, they were getting out of the business-- what about the other file?
it has a list of their clients.
their names, addresses, phone numbers, all their information, everything.
insurance policy? Their ticket out.
they weren't hired to make a hit, Gibbs. They are the hit.
did you know the Peruvians make blades so sharp, some people cat even feel the initial incision. Stop.
the disk's in our hotel room.
don't. He'll only use it... Where?
she has to show you.
not what I asked.
you'll never find it without her.
even if you kill us.
untie her.
I'm in position.
clear the room-- I'm on my way up with the girl.
my pleasure.
your only mistake was going for one last big payday.
you got greedy.
I'm pregnant.
Really?
Congratulations.
boy or girl?
I don't know.
we want to be surprised.
that's the best way, believe me.
how many months?
three.
morning sickness?
only every single day.
I hated to see my wife go through it.
but believe me, it's all worth it in the end.
so you're not going to kill us?
we're assassins.
you know we can't just walk away from the game when we feel like it.
hell, and to think I'd rather be at my daughter's fifth birthday than here.
so you are gonna kill us, right?
I haven't decided yet.
give me the disk, and we'll see.
play it by ear.
if I'm not back in five minutes...
...Kill him.
that was purely for your wife's cooperation.
we like to call them little white lies.
open it.
I hope you weren't counting on your backup, Mrs. Ranier.
he's not my backup.
Tony! Third floor, room 356.
all teams, third floor, room 356.
federal agent in distress.
copy. We're moving.
you know what's funny?
I was really looking forward to having a kid there for a minute.
this is a big step for me.
having a little DiNozzo running around.
Yeah, that's my full name-- Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo,
how's that feel, huh?!
huh, big guy?!
enough!
you want to punch me again? Come on!
Tony, enough, enough.
I think you made your point.
I want a divorce.
the emergency room seems to have done a pretty good job.
how do you feel?
better, now that I can breathe.
there doesn't appear to be any permanent damage.
how many times did he hit you?
I wasn't counting.
seven times.
she was, of course.
it was hard not to.
we're gonna take really good care of you, Tony.
I had Chipulyour car right around front.
he drove my car?
just... from your parking space.
I took extra special care.
Oh. Thanks.
and, uh,
I'm driving you home. Probie?
uh, Ziva, actually, I should probably drive him home tonight.
why is that?
maybe he wants to li.
Yes, well, however you get home,
I suggest a couple of aspirin.
Yes, and perhaps some scotch.
thought doctors weren't supposed to prescribe alcohol anymore, Duck.
well, it always seems to work for you.
you get tickets to that Gazelle thing again?
it's Giselle, Jethro, and no, that's not tonight.
marine Corps birthday ball.
she didn't tell you?
our lovely director has asked me to escort her.
all right, good night, boss.
darn!
I'm good.
Hey, Gbs.
happy birthday.
I miss you guys.
stop look at me like that.
I was a freshman in college.
there are little teenage DiNozzos running around somewhere?
that's frightening.
I never thought about it until this morning.
I got a registered letter from the sperm bank telling me to contact them as soon as possible.
Why?
I don't know.
we're moving, DiNozzo.
coming out.
we're on our way down.
Roger, boss.
the car's ready.
check the exit. - On it
they're coming down!
Yes, sir. Standing by
you're making a big mistake!
why don't you just back off?
boss, hold on one second.
what do you got, McGee?
I'm not sure.
you're not telling me what to do.
talk to me, McGee.
go, go, go!
get him out of here through the front entrance! Go!
go, go, go, go!
you find a weapon?
Nope.
Yeah, well, we're done.
let's bag 'em and tag 'em, Mr. Palmer.
Yes, sir.
you think Mr. Ryan was connected in any way to the death threat on the Chief of Naval Operations?
gonna find out.
it came from a human rights group protesting Marine abuse of prisoners at Gitmo.
it's ironic, isn't it?
a human rights group threatening to kill?
it's no different than a right-to-lifer bombing a family planning clinic, Doc.
Yes, we live in interesting times, Jethro.
you think, Duck?
way to go, Probie-- three shots, three shots, three hits.
guess my instruction on the range paid off, huh?
Tony, I killed somebody, okay?
what about the CNO?
secured at home.
doubled his security detail.
did you find his weapon?
no.
it's got to be here.
I identified myself as a federal officer, he fired at me,
I returned fire, and the SUV drove off.
his weapon has got to be here.
the SUV, McGee
did you get the color, number, model?
dark blue or black.
virginia plate.
first two numbers: 8-9.
I don't know the model.
Ziva, get out a BOLO.
on just that?
right. BOLO. - Hang on.
Hey.
I want to know everything about this guy.
McGee, go back where you fired from.
show me, McGee.
federal officer. Drop your weapon.
got it? - Got it.
don't worry, McGee.
we'll find the slug.
this guy's a mess.
Yeah, you don't know the half of it.
his lungs were completely blackened from what I would guess is a two-pack-a-day habit.
his coronary arteries are almost completely blocked, and his liver shows definite sign of abuse.
this little sluggy's in good shape.
I took that out of his thigh.
didn't impact any bone, then embedded itself in the adductor longus.
Ooh, this one's all banged up.
Yeah. Left shoulder.
it entered the deltoid pectoral triangle, smashed the fourth rib, and ended up in the upper lobe of his left lung.
both those were nonlethal.
that one, however, caused massive damage.
you know, there was a time when you wouldn't set foot in Autopsy.
look how far I've come.
regrettably, for the moment.
look, back off.
I think I'm ready for the next big step.
and what's that?
assisting in an autopsy.
Oh, yeah, right!
actually, Mr. Palmer, a medical degree is not required, even to be a coroner.
Abby has an exceptional analytical mind.
and she's a quick study.
I think you'd do very well.
put it on.
your first lesson
lesson number one.
the third bullet removed what was left of the fourth rib, smashing the costal cartilage, took a piece out of the left atrium, and lodged itself against the costal surface of the scapula.
it's amazing how much damage one bullet can do.
definitely the kill shot.
something wrong?
I'm sorry, McGee.
that wasn't meant for your ears.
not a problem, Ducky.
Yeah, I was hoping when I woke up this morning, it was all a nightmare.
somebody needs a hug.
I was trained for last night, but...
well, shooting at human cutout is not quite the same, Timothy.
no one is prepared for their first kill
Abby, I'm gonna need you to run his prints.
driver's license was phony.
the only Andrew Aidan Ryan I could find is three years old and lives in Los Angeles.
the address, if it existed, would be in the middle of the Potomac.
run his prints.
why didn't we think of that, Tony?
Abby's working on it.
FBI's identified three radical groups protesting prisoner abuse at Gitmo, boss.
catch anything with the BOLO, Officer David?
we did. 600, 000 SUVs.
that are registered in Virginia.
Yeah. So?
so, we're gonna check them against radical groups.
something bothering you, Tony?
he doesn't want to say what we're all thinking
spit it out.
McGee says he was shot at, but we can't seem to find the slug, shell casing or a weapon.
Yeah. Gibbs.
sir, the Director would like to see you in her office.
be right up.
McGee isn't your father, and he isn't Ari.
he doesn't know how to lie.
What'd he say?
to go back to work.
go right in, Special Agent Gibbs.
shut the door, Jethro.
I'm flashing back to Paris in '99.
not what you're thinking.
no? Then what?
I remember you covering for another agent who messed up.
what agent was that?
you know damn well what agent!
Oh, you mean the time you shot that guy...
did McGee blow it?
McGee's a probie.
probies make mistakes.
having said that, no, I don't think he did.
Where's the gun?
the slug that was fired...
I don't know, but I will find out.
the CNO's aide called me at 7: 00 a. m. this morning.
Admiral Chapman wants to know what's going on.
he asked me...
what are you thinking about?
Paris.
get your mind out of the bedroom, Jethro.
let's get some answers.
your call is very important to us.
please stay on the line.
we will be with you in a moment.
you've been holding for 15 minutes.
must be important.
Yup.
the sperm bank?
Yeah.
why'd you do it?
you didn't need the money.
it was easier than giving blood.
you enjoyed making those deposits.
was there a penalty for early withdrawal?
you're a sick chick, David.
thank you for holding.
Hi, there.
I received a certified letter requesting.
I call... Uh...
Thanks, Agent Vandalay. You are the man.
I owe you one, man. - Anything useful, DiNozzo?
of the 621, 800 SUVs registered in Virginia, approximately 127, 000 of them are dark colored.
vanity plates aside, one in every hundred begins with the numbers 8-9.
it's over 1, 200 vehicles.
we're running the registered owns against the names on the list of protesters.
it's gonna take a while.
what's wrong?
I run the fingerprint through AFIS.
the victim's real name is John Benedict.
has he got a record?
he was a Metro detective.
he was working undercover.
I killed a cop, boss.
can I get you two anything?
no, thanks.
Yes, ma'am, I'll send them in.
special Agents Gibbs and McGee, this is Metro Police Captain Dan Karzin and Sergeant Keith Archer, the dead officer's apartment - I'm sorry about... - The Director Shepard already gave us the official NCIS condolences, Special Agent McGee.
we're here to find out what happened.
please sit.
I'd like to ask Sergeant Archer some questions.
you know why your partner was behind the hotel last night?
no. We were off duty.
when did you last see him?
yesterday about noon.
they were working undercover narcotics.
just got off a 36-hour shift.
I read your report.
I got some questions.
you say you identified yourself?
Yes, sir.
loud enough to be heard?
definitely.
and you contend that Lieutenant Benedict then turned and fired at you?
Yes, sir.
so why can't you find a bullet or weapon?
we can't answer that, yet.
Yeah, I can:
Bennie wasn't carrying one.
are you sure it happened like that, son?
it happened the way that I reported it, Captain.
because I knew Lieutenant John Benedict maybe 20 years.
he was a highly decorated officer.
a great cop.
and if Agent McGee had properly identified himself the way that he claims, there's no way that Benedi would've acted threateningly
evidently, he did.
I don't believe it.
special Agent McGee, why don't you return to the squad room.
we'll call you if we need you.
I'm really sorry.
with all due respect, Director Shepard,
I think we all know what happened here.
nobody else saw another vehicle in the alley.
a nervous rookie panicked.
fired prematurely.
killed a veteran cop.
McGee's young, but he's a damned good agent.
are you sure your partner wasn't carrying a weapon last night?
it would have blown his cover on the case that we were working.
you said he was off duty, just like you are right now?
Yeah. - You're carrying.
small of your back.
your partner's liver said he drank a lot...
Oh, go to hell!
gentlemen...
I'm not going to stand for a cover-up.
and neither am I, Captain.
I shared our preliminary report, and you'll have full access to our findings.
I'm going to conduct my own investigation.
that is your prerogative. - And I want to interrogate McGee.
that's not going to happen.
I'll handle this, Special Agent Gibbs.
McGee has made his statement, that's not going to change.
thank you for coming.
you'll have NCIS's full cooperation.
do I get to question Agent McGee?
Yes.
but not today.
before you jump down my throat, you think about what you would do if that cop shot McGee, and McGee didn't have a weapon!
DiNozzo, look at this.
got a possible 32 year-old white male, lives in Alexandria.
drives a 2003, dark-blue Ford Expedition.
first two digits of license plate: 8-9.
McGee, was the SUV as big as an Expedition?
uh... maybe.
I don't know. I'm not sure.
this guy belongs to a protest group called "CACA."
you're making that up.
citizens Against Criminal Abuse.
he was arrested last May for defacing the main entrance of the Pentagon with horse manure.
call me crazy, but a guy that belongs to a group called CACA, and smears horse pucky on a government building, isn't making death threats.
get back in that alley, find that damn bullet!
do it now!
boss, we spent hours. We covered every inch of where McGee was standing when he...
well, maybe we'll find something in daylight.
we're working the protester angle.
I don't think that cop being there had anything to do with the threat against that CNO.
can somebody tell me what the hell is going on here?
first, Abby's lab nerd frames DiNozzo for murder, and then McGee kills a cop.
did somebody break a mirror?
boss, can I go with Tony and Ziva?
extra set of eyes might help.
No!
metro PD is out to get you.
you find the bullet, it's compromised evidence.
Hey, DiNozzo?
while you're there, see if anyone saw Benedict in the area last night.
got it.
what should I do?
find that SUV.
this is a waste of time.
Gibbs says search the alley again, we search the alley again.
you never question anything he tells you to do, huh?
Nope.
we can't find anything because there is nothing to be found.
you don't believe McGee was shot at?
McGee stumbled across something, misread it and overreacted.
not McGee.
his brain's like a computer.
it's scary.
I'm sure procedures and regs warp-sped through his processor before he pulled the trigger.
it happens so fast.
you don't have time to think.
we're talking about a guy who has protocols and checklist for brushing and flossing.
I'll start flashing Benedict's photo on the street.
Hey.
how you doing?
okay.
what's this music?
I'm almost done here.
tox screen?
Yeah.
it's Benedict's.
Ducky said his liver showed signs of cirrhosis, but he was clean and sober last night.
is that why you called me down here?
Nope.
come with me, McG.
where are we going?
your therapy session.
what?
what's that smell?
aromatherapy.
you're stressed, anxious.
30 minutes in here, and you'll be back to yourself.
probably even better.
now, sit.
I don't believe in New Age panaceas, Abby.
what are these things?
frankincense, lavender, and nerolioil.
what the hell's nerolioil?
used for the treatment of depression, nervous tension, flatulence, and irritable bowel syndrome.
are you denying that more than one of those applies to you?
know what? I think I'm gonna pass.
well, where did you get those?
never leave home without 'em.
okay, Abby, I have to get back to work.
and you will, as soon as you clear your mind.
you'll see things from a new perspective
just relax, enjoy and inhale.
you still here?
no. I'm the Director's doppelganger.
never did know what that meant.
good night. - Good night.
so, a doppelganger is someone who's pissed?
Yes, Agent Gibbs, - this one definitely is. - Why?
Why? Because you countermanded me in front of Metro police.
I didn't countermand you.
you overruled me!
Semantics!
is that like doppelganger?
get a dictionary!
ha, ha! Open up, McGee.
Tony, I'm really not in the mood.
let me in.
okay, you're in. What do you want?
we're going out.
where?
when the going gets tough, go clubbing.
we have got to get you dressed.
Tony, I really want to be alone tonight, okay?
no, you don't.
still working on the novel, I see, huh?
DiNozzo, I'm begging you, do not rag on me tonight, okay?
well, I wouldn't be DiNozzo if I didn't.
the wardrobe.
you got any party clothes, McGeek?
Tony... Baby, you are not gonna be scoring in any of this stuff.
Hey, would you stop?!
I'm not going anywhere!
Hey, listen, man, I'm sorry. I just wanted...
no. I know, I know.
I know you're just trying to help.
Tony, I'm not like you guys.
you were trained as a cop.
Gibbs was a Marine sniper.
Kate protected the President of the United States.
God only knows what Ziva did with Mossad.
my background is biomedical engineering and computer forensics.
I don't think I'm cut out to be a field agent.
first time I shot at that someone...
I wet my pants.
Really?
really.
if you tell anyone that, I will slap you silly.
Ooh, you got anything to eat?
I know it's bad.
I've been where you are but a week from now, this will all be behind you, just a bad memory.
what time you get up, Ziva?
4 o'clock.
background check on the cop McGee killed didn't come up with anything.
he drank a little too much, had three ex-wives...
well, that does not make him a bad person.
his police service record is clean.
several commendations for meritorious meritorious service and a Mayoral award.
nothing negative.
metro's going to make it look like our probie killed their hero.
they're going to interrogate McGee this afternoon
request was approved by the director.
and you know this how?
I'm a spy... remember?
when were you going to tell me?
I see we're picking up where we left off yesterday.
if you're sending McGee to Metro, you're damn right we are!
didn't know I had to ask your permission.
don't give me "the stare."
I'm not a junior agent anymore. - No, you're a junior director.
that's enough, Special Agent Gibbs!
excuse me, Director.
they're waiting for you in MTAC.
I'm on my way, Cynthia.
you have to learn how to say no!
I did, Jethro.
or have you forgotten?
McGee, what are you doing here so early?
I had an epiphany:
a different way of tracking the SUV.
so the aromatherapy worked.
it cleared your mind so you could come up with new ideas.
don't know about that.
I do.
did you get any sleep last night?
not much. DiNozzo kept me up till 3: 00.
our DiNozzo?
he came by my apartment to cheer me up.
really.
Yeah, I know-- DiNozzo being nice to me means I'm really in trouble.
I think it's sweet.
so, what was your light bulb?
well, uh, are you familiar with the Ajzen/Fishbein Theory of Reasoned Action?
of course.
if Lieutenant Benedict was having an argument with the man in the SUV the theory hypothesizes there's a high probability they had prior contact.
so you're matching SUV owners to people Benedict knew?
exactly.
using what as a database?
I wrote this program to cross-check registered owners with telephone calls and e-mails, sent and received by Benedict over the last three months.
Timothy, that's brilliant.
eh, I thought so, but,
I didn't get any hits. Problem is, I only got his home and cell numbers.
I was denied access to Benedict's extension at Metro.
if you had the maintenance codes for the telephone servers at the police department, do you think that would help?
Yes.
while you're getting me a CAFF-POW!
I'll make a phone call.
is there any way of finding out why she wants to talk to me?
not without asking her.
are you a personal friend of hers?
I was a donor.
I'm sorry, could you speak up? I can't hear you.
I'm a donor.
Oh, a donor. Right.
uh, what was your last name again?
uh, could you spell that for me, please?
big "D," little "I," big "N," little "ozzo."
Uh-huh. And your first name?
Anthony. - Uh, would you please hold a moment, Mr. DiNozzo?
playing phone tag with the sperm bank.
you haven't found out what it's about yet?
well...
essence of DiNozzo.
Hello, sir? - Yeah, I'm here.
uh, she's in a meeting at the moment.
Uh-huh.- Out of the office.
when will she be back?
uh, not till tomorrow.
thank you.- You are welcome
problem?
the woman who's been trying to contact me isn't there.
her title is Director of Critical Issues.
what do you think that means?
I don't know, but it sounds serious.
it could be one of my offspring has a medical condition.
maybe they need an organ transplant.
you... you...
who won't share a Krispy Kreme donut...
you are going to give up a kidney?
you wouldn't understand.
you're not a parent.
that's so cute.
I didn't know you were superstitious.
I'm not.
we've got a hit.
owns a black 2005 Range Rover.
license plate 8967YZE.
he received a call from Benedict's Metro office extension two weeks ago.
you want to know how McGee found out?- No
Halligan's an Irish National.
he's been living here for the past three years.
I'll run him by my Interpol contacts.
find him, Tony. Bring him in here.
on it.
so... are you going to bust them, Archer?
blow my cover?
why don't you?
they don't look Navy.
who you staking out?
it's a second-tier pusher released from Elkton this morning.
right now, he's in that hotel reacquainting himself with his old lady.
historically, the pusher's second stop is to look for employment, so...
hoping he'll lead me to a local distributor.
surprised you agreed to meet.
just want to find out the truth.
appreciate it if Captain Karzin didn't find out we were talking.
not going to hear anything from me.
you know this guy?
never met him, but I'd love to get my hands on him.
it's Ed Halligan.
he's a rich Irishman rumored to be the money behind a local crack ring.
drives a black SUV.
collects expensive cars. He has dozens of them.
why'd Benedict call him two weeks ago?
we set a trap for Halligan, but he never showed.
Bennie suspected he was tipped.
well, what are you getting at, Gibbs?
we think that Halligan was the guy your partner was talking to in the alley.
if he was, he had a legitimate reason.
wouldn't he have told you?
look, I'm...
I was the junior partner on the team.
we hadn't been together that long so he didn't share everything with me.
if you think that he was a dirty cop forget it.
Bennie was as straight up as they come.
you just said you hadn't been together evey long.
how long does it take to know if your partner's dirty?
that your dirtbag?
Yeah. I got to get to work.
okay.
anxious?
does it show?
may I give you some advice?
please.
be confident when Metro interrogates you.
if you don't believe what you're saying, how can they?
every time I think about it...
it comes out a little different.
for God's sakes, don't tell that to Metro.
Where's the boss?
Where's Halligan?
uh, not at home. I went to his house.
it's really more like an estate.
it's all marble and stone.
monolithic thing with Greco-Roman statues,
impressionist art and flowers everywhere.
in the front hall, there were these two flowers like swans that were kissing...
what about the Range Rover?
Oh, uh, that wasn't in the garage, but the thing was loaded.
Lamborghinis, Ferraris, 1965 Aston Martin-- the Goldfinger...
sorry.
sorry. Reminded me of when I was a kid in the Hamptons.
so you have no idea where he went?
well, he told Seamus.
that's his houseboy.
he was going away for a few days.
I'm telling you, if I had a master bedroom like that, mirrors on the ceiling...
my contact at Interpol said Halligan's been under investigation in Ireland, Britain and France.
several indictments, all drug related, but none ever...
Oh, leazazel.
whatever that is doesn't sound good.
Halligan's on the goat.
Oh, no, no, not goat. Uh, uh, uh...
sheep.
Lam?
that's it.
he's on the lam. There's no "B" in that, by the way.
thank you.
he bought a ticket at Dulles yesterday afternoon.
to Ireland?
rabat, Morocco, via Lisbon.
no extradition.
Benedict was arresting him.
I killed a cop arresting a drug lord.
his goose is cooked.
you would get that one right.
point a weapon at you...
did he?
no.
the Director in?
expecting you.
close the door, please.
no. You don't want that door closed, Director.
I don't? - No!
let her rip.
the US Attorney's office is charging McGee with negligent homicide.
metro's booking him right now. Do you know why?
because he admitted to making a tragic mistake.
no. Because you may know how to kiss ass, but you sure don't know how to protect it!
and you think you're protecting that boy by ignoring the facts?
he's not a boy. He's an NCIS Special Agent.
he's one of my people.
I don't leave my people behind.
it's a marine thing.
what are you going to do?
I'm gonna go to Metro and get him.
no.
no?
your eyesight's weak, not your hearing.
you're not going to Metro because McGee's on his way here.
I convinced Captain Karzin that he wasn't a flight risk and to release him into our custody until his arraignment hearing.
you should have gone with him.
why me? He's your bud.
bud?
bud.
buddy. Friend.
you're not McGee's friend?
of course I'm his friend.
english is a very confusing language.
if you're his... Oh...
there's that word again.
huh. Interpol missed Halligan in Portugal.
he cleared Moroc customs an hour ago.
I let you down.
boss, I think it's other way round.
I should have gone with you to Metro.
I don't think it would have made a difference.
I panicked.
I thought he had a weapon in his hand.
I need to face it.
I shot a good cop making an arrest.
what cop makes a drug bust without a weapon?
none.
rule number eight is gonna save you, McGee.
never date a coworker?
never go anywhere without your knife.
I thought that was nine. - Never take anything for granted.
correct, Jefe, but then again, you did make up the rules...
get to the point, Abs.
I didn't do forensics on the jacket because we knew what happened.
then I remembered rulenumero ocho.
gunshot residue.
based on the density and pattern of the stippling and sooting, one of the slugs in Lieutenant Benedict was fired from only one foot away.
one of my shots missed?
I knew you weren't that good, Probie.
three for three at 25 meters,
I don't think so.
halligan shot him from behind the wheel.
wrong, boss!
slap him, Ziva.
if Halligan was behind the wheel then he was five or six feet away.
pulled the registration from the Range Rover.
it was brought in the DMV for an inspection,
right-hand drive.
british, like Ducky's Morgan.
steering wheel's on the right-hand side.
the person I saw arguing with Benedict was a passenger.
there was a third man.
that's a great movie.
joseph Cotten, Orson Welles... - We're looking in the wrong direction.
if McGee's third round didn't hit the SUV, then it's somewhere at the other end of that alley.
go. Abby, thank you.
boss, he still didn't fire at me.
you saw a flash, McGee.
you heard a gunshot.
you had no way of knowing if Benedict was firing at your or not.
if I was in your position, McGee,
I'd have fired.
go on.
run Halligan's phone records.
see if you can't figure out who he was meeting with.
right.
could be your two rounds weren't the fatal one.
you ever Gibbs-slap me again, David, and I will slap you back harder.
I was following orders.
the dutiful Mossad agent.
you miss the spy game? Must have been exciting.
you've seen too many James Bond movies.
it's not all about car chases and sex.
it wasn't?
well, there was a lot of sex.
Ooh.
614. Ohio.
sperm bank.
Yeah, this is Anthony DiNozzo.
there's something I need to talk to you about.
yeah?
your sperm is being discarded.
Yeah, I know. But there's got to be - some kind of mistake. - You are Anthony DiNozzo?
Yeah, that's me, but...
were you hoping for notification of birth?
no.
well, have a nice day.
thank you. - You're welcome.
you want to discuss it?
it's nothing.
for two days, you've obsessed on that letter, driving me crazy.
now, all of a sudden, it's nothing?
drop it.
I understand.
I'd be embarrassed, too.
I shouldn't have done it.
but your phone kept on ringing this morning and I knew this call was important, so I answered it.
you, you talked...
to the woman at the sperm bank.
the Director of Critical Issues.
Yes.
I'm sorry, Tony.
she had no right to tell you that no one wants my sperm!
Yes!
you didn't talk to her.
so no little DiNozzos anywhere.
it's hard to believe that a stud like you would not be chosen.
were any of the prospective women shown a photo of you?
cause...
you're enjoying this a lot, aren't you?
Oh... yes.
are they going to return your sperm?
let's focus on finding the bullet.
don't have to.
the striations in the bullets are exact.
it was definitely fired from McGee's sig.
where did you two find the bullet?
miss Abby Sciuto.
right here, boss.
behind the body, embedded in the door frame.
McGee was wide to the left.
where the hell is Benedict's weapon?
yeah?
I have a theory.
okay.
McGee identified himself.
the man in the car fires point-blank at Benedict.
now, like you said, it was too close and it was dark.
so McGee couldn't distinguish where the flash came from.
and McGee fires back.
one missed.
and when Benedict fell, he drops his weapon through the open window of the Range Rover.
what do you think?
what's going on?
saving your butt, McGee.
Hey, come on, what do you got?
it's a dump of Halligan's phone records.
morning of the shooting, placed several calls to Sergeant Archer's home and cell phones.
you mean Benedict's?
no, Archer, his partner.
the call from Metro two weeks ago came from Archer, not Benedict.
partners share extensions at the precinct.
I showed Archer a picture of Halligan yesterday.
he acted like they never met.
one of the phone calls lasted 18 minutes.
come on, McGee, you're with me.
McGee, come here.
use my backup.
archer's got to know that Halligan's in Morocco.
he's never gonna talk.
is Halligan in Morocco?
Ziva said he passed through customs.
well, maybe Archer doesn't know that.
pull an old warrant.
what's up?
got a few questions.
he's supposed to be in custody.
he's in my custody.
you never told me you spoke with Halligan.
never did.
phone records show you exchanged several calls.
I don't care what your phone records say.
I never talked to Halligan. Ask him.
one of the calls was two weeks ago, about the time you claim you set the trap for Halligan.
you know what? I don't need this from the guy who killed my partner.
McGee shot him...
after someone inside the car fired first.
your partner suspected you were working with Halligan.
he followed you to a meet in the alley
you guys aren't laying this off on me.
we pulled a nine-millimeter slug out of Benedict's chest.
I want to run that against your service weapon.
we're gonna search the premises.
I'm not talking to Navy wannabe cops.
Interpol picked Halligan up in Lisbon.
he never made it to Morocco.
we'll get him back here, and he'll talk.
Halligan's not gonna take the fall for you.
don't ever hesitate because you second-guessed yourself, again.
I'll take your badge.
we clear?
clear.
I thought you would be out celebrating.
no.
did you come down for a hug?
What'd you find out?
I ran every test I could think of.
the slugs are too damaged.
there's no way to tell who fired the kill shot.
does it really matter?
Yeah.
it matters.
never get tired of this sight.
Ah, you and me both.
Where's number three?
McMannis? - Yes?
we have a loose one.
I can't take much more of this!
it's driving us crazy!
Where's Taylor?
maybe she got lucky and escaped.
they're coming.
Oh, my God!
tell me you did not just wave at me, Vance?!
you call yourself a supermodel?
right now the only thing you are super at is looking like an idiot on TV!
I count two of you.
where is little princess number three?
Oh, my God.
the next award to be presented is the Meritorious Civilian Service Medal.
would Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs please step forward.
she went with the elf cut?
it's called the "pixie."
I think she looks terrific.
Where's Gibbs?
all the years I've known him, he's never once turned up for an awards ceremony.
even if he's the one receiving, Ducky?
especially if he's the one receiving it.
special Agent Gibbs?
told you he wouldn't show.
pay up.
you got change for a 20?
no.
nice haircut.
where the hell is he, DiNozzo?
he's working on a case.
what case?
the one that's preventing him from being here. I'll take that for him, though.
accepting for Special Agent Gibbs is Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.
she's pretty.
I'd like to think I'm the Michael Douglas to his Karl Malden - on the streets of D. C... - And thank you, everybody.
that concludes our awards ceremony. Thank you.
Gibbs... Gibbs thanks you... Thank you.
is this on? I have a speech. I didn't...
I wrote a whole...whole thing.
where are you?
I'm right behind you.
I really hate it when you do that.
Tony has your award.
he can keep it.
some things never change, do they, Jethro?
depends on your definition of change.
my definition...
I expect you to be there the next time I'm handing you an award.
DiNozzo didn't tell you? I'm working a case.
Oh, alone in my office? - It's high-profile, Jen.
I thought you'd want to hear about it before it hits the news.
I'm listening.
well, there's a dead celebrity at Quantico.
who?
some woman named Taylor Shane.
the supermodel?
found her hanging from an OCS security fence this morning.
then why aren't you there?
I just got the call five minutes ago.
Oh, and the awards ceremony started 30 minutes ago.
well, you know me- I like to get a head start on things. I'll keep you informed.
Jethro, the press is going to be all over this one.
I'd appreciate it if you could go easy on them.
telling me how to do my job, Director?
no, just reiterating your previous point.
which was?
I know you.
break out the gear.
boot Camp Babes is a real TV show?
reality TV at its finest. Three hot, rich babes learning what's truly important in life.
defending their country.
no, firing machine guns while wearing bikinis.
I think I like your reason better, Ziva.
your Marine Corps would actually allow these models to serve?
well, they're not joining for real.
it's a stunt. Kind of like The Simple Life.
the Simple Life?
Yeah, that show about Paris Hilton?
I never heard of it.
but I've been there a few times.
I wouldn't mind spending a night there myself.
Oh, you have no idea. I often dream about it.
Really?
what?
just trying to picture Paris and you together.
don't get your hopes up.
I'm not attracted to blondes.
this is bad.
Gibbs is going to go completely and utterly ape...
here he comes.
what happened to the girl? What are you hiding?
I just got here.
what is the official word on Taylor Shane's cause of death?
like I said, I just got here.
what condition was her body found in?
I just got here. I haven't even had a chance...
what about the other girls? How are the other girls handling it?
how are they handling it...?
okay, that's it. Interview's over.
I'm sorry. It was an accident.
I don't care.
sergeant...
secure the area.
special Agent Gibbs...
wow, she really was beautiful.
she still is, Mr. Palmer.
she's been dead at least five hours, Jethro.
I'm more interested in how she got that way, Duck.
well, her body is covered with these lacerations.
none of them appear to be fatal.
we'll know more when we get her back.
um... I'll just go get the gurney now.
who moved the body?
I did, sir.
didn't think it was right them taking pictures of Taylor hanging on the wire like that.
you have any crime scene experience, Staff Sergeant McMannis?
no, sir. But I do have public affairs experience.
photos like that aren't why the Corps agreed to support this show.
you the liaison?
Yes, sir.
we've been trying to contact the producer, Thomas Crawley.
he doesn't know anything about this yet.
how'd she get up there?
looked like she was trying to climb over. That doesn't make any sense, sir.
if she wanted off the show, all she had to do was ask. It's not like this is a real boot camp.
McGee, photos.
Ziva, interview the rest of the models. DiNozzo...
boss, I'm pretty familiar with the show. Maybe I should interview them.
that would work for me. I hate models.
is that so?
McGee... Help Ziva... interview them.
any other suggestions, DiNozzo?
no, I think I got it.
good.
I'm going to need to see all the footage that you shot on this thing.
you got it, sir. Post production office is right over here.
do you want me to get their autographs, Tony?
Hey, Probie...
see if you can get them to sign it to the "Big D.
what was she doing out there, Hannah?
probably just looking for a bigger story line.
think about it, Nat, the big escape. Would have made some great TV.
unfortunately, it did.
special Agent McGee, and Officer David, NCIS. We would like to ask you a few questions.
in private, please. - Okay, let's go.
when was the last time you saw Ms. Shane?
lights out. - Time?
around 10: 30.
do you really believe she did this as a stunt?
I don't know. I mean, Taylor would do anything for more camera time.
Hannah, she's dead, okay? Stop being a bitch.
the cameras are off, Natalie.
you can stop pretending you cared about her.
hmm, you didn't get along.
we're supermodels, honey.
we don't have to get along.
on the show you three seem like such good friends.
they shoot us 24 hours a day, Agent McGee.
you only get to see 23 minutes of it.
Hey, just about done here, boss. Thought I might check on the rest of the team...
you're riding with the body.
make sure those damn reporters don't follow you back.
how am I supposed to do that...? - Improvise.
give me the keys. I'm driving.
Thanks, Ducky.
anything else I can help you with?
like maybe some hair tips for your girlfriend here?
no, I think that about covers it.
but if you can remember anything else that might help, please give us a call.
it's called a business card.
maybe you can have one of the marines read it to you.
no bones broken, no major arteries severed and take a look at the tox screen.
her death was not the result of tangling with the razor wire.
phencyclidine. Angel dust.
Yeah. It's an overdose of PCP.
drove that poor girl flailing into that fence.
she had a seizure, fell into a coma and died.
an accidental overdose, Duck?
I doubt it. She had enough PCP in her system to kill a small water buffalo.
water buffalo?
I tire of saying small horse.
I'm afraid our young model might have committed suicide.
we don't investigate suicides, Duck.
we don't investigate suicides?
technically no.
but even the most obvious suicide is investigated by NCIS as a murder.
on a Marine base surrounded by cameras...
Yes.
the stuff good mysteries are made of, Mr. Palmer.
the incident shocked the entertainment industry and entire nation.
the sudden and gruesome death of super model and recent reality star, Taylor Shane.
the 25-year-old was found at approximately 6: 10 yesterday morning, hanging atop a barrier fence at the Quantico Marine base.
Shane was at Quantico participating in hit reality show Boot Camp Babes.
I'll just fast forward to the good part.
special Agent Gibbs, is the Marine Corps attempting to cover up how Taylor Shane died.
the interview's over.
the people have a right to know.
I don't care.
what were you thinking?
give me a break, Jen, I wasn't even asked that question.
you're saying they did a hatchet job on you?
Yeah, are you saying you don't believe me?
you were wrong the other day. Some things do change.
part of our job is to make sure that they don't creatively edit our interviews, Jethro.
no, that's maybe your job, Director. My job is to catch dirtbags.
the Marine Corps does not need anymore bad publicity at this moment.
supporting something called Boot Camp Babes? What did they think was gonna happen?
the intention of the show was to represent that the Marines could be a life changing experience.
I have a dead girl downstairs and an investigation to run.
I've got an entire agency to run, and sound bites like these do not help when the budget's under review.
or maybe you'd like to go back to the days when we had to buy our own ammo to train on the range.
okay, you want me to help fix this? Then get me that reporter's number.
you're going to apologize?
no, ask her to dinner.
there's Ducky. Ducky looks good.
here's the autopsy gremlin.
there it is! Right there. That's my jacket.
that's McGee's jacket.
I didn't make a single broadcast.
I wish I could say the same.
camera must have added about ten pounds to me.
actually, that was your refrigerator, Probie.
you think Gibbs watched the news last night?
I know the director did.
he's been up in her office for the past half an hour.
anyone else think they were more than just partners back in the day?
Hi, boss.
we're just talking about Cagney and Lacey. It was a real good show.
what we got?
Taylor Shane checked into the Los Angeles Better Health Center in August of '02 and then again in May of '03.
publicist said it was an eating disorder, but, uh, the truth is it was heroin, cocaine and...
PCP. - Bingo, boss.
friends have given several interviews over the years.
they blame her drug problem mostly on the boyfriend,
Noah Keller, son of Marshall Keller.
Ooh, that guy owns half of Manhattan. His kids are loaded, too.
well, this kid was arrested for possession of illegal narcotics three times in the last five years. Twice for cocaine, once for PCP.
find him.
already on it.
that executive show guy, Crawley? He got back last night?
the term is "executive producer."
whatever. Interview him.
I want to know how this girl did a fistful of PCP in the middle of his reality show.
that guy dates super models?
they're shallow, he's wealthy. It's the perfect match.
isn't your family wealthy?
that's different.
Why?
my dad cut me off when I was 12.
I had to earn all my dates the old fashioned way.
begging.
Hey, Abs, got some good news for you.
just talked to the director, your new assistant starts Monday.
no, Gibbs.
no, I can't go through that again.
that is so not funny.
no? - No.
it was to me, kind of. Here you go.
where are we?
well, I know why no one heard Taylor screaming when she was on the wire the other night.
two 300-car trains passed by OCS the same time she died.
I doubt anyone could have heard anything.
you on a new diet, Abs? - Yep according to Ducky, there were no signs of intravenous drug use on the body, and there were traces of PCP in the lungs.
she took it orally.
but...
there were also no traces of the binders and chemicals you would find when something's taken by pill.
Yeah, well, I'm guessing that's what all this is about.
you would be guessing right.
there were traces of PCP in her stomach.
there was also dextrose, ferrous sulfate, riboflavin and a bunch of other chemicals that are consistent with these delectable pastries.
okay, which one?
that's what I've been trying to figure out. It's kind of fun. It reminds me of Bill Nye.
who?
bill Nye the Science Guy? Wacky scientist with a kid's show?
Oh, like Mr. Wizard.
who?
never mind. - So, anyways,
bill Nye did an episode where he broke down the molecular structure of junk food pastries, same thing I did today, only Bill Nye was trying to get kids to eat healthier, and his pastries weren't laced with PCP, although Bill Nye once...
Abby, the case?
two things I know.
one, I like cream filling, and two, her last meal was this.
I think we're looking at death by Klowny Kake.
that's good work, Abs.
Taylor got along with everyone, Hannah.
everyone but you.
your point is, Staff Sergeant?
she committed suicide for a reason, I want to know why.
how the hell would I know?
you been abusing her on and off camera for the past two months.
Oh, so it's my fault she decided to off herself?
I want to know what happened in this room last night.
well, let's see.
I went to bed,
Natalie probably snuck off two or three times to the bathroom to throw up, and Taylor...
well, she apparently decided to hang herself from a barbed wire fence.
anything else I can help you with, Staff Sergeant?
you're a real piece of work, Bressling.
get out of my sight. I'll see you at the pull-up bars.
with pleasure.
is this a bad time, Staff Sergeant?
no, ma'am.
just counting the days till this reality show is off of my base.
we need to speak with Thomas Crawley.
so do I, sir.
he's asked not to be disturbed.
a girl died from a drug overdose while taping the show.
disturbing him is not our primary concern.
Taylor overdosed? On what?
PCP, a lot of it.
that's why she tried to climb that fence because she was on drugs?
she was most likely delusional.
perhaps she thought someone was chasing her.
you know how she got the drugs, Staff Sergeant?
no, sir.
I know she had some problems in the past, but if anything, she was anti-drugs.
hell, she wouldn't even take an aspirin.
Where's Crawley, Staff Sergeant?
his office. It's just outside that door.
Mr. Crawley.
Mr. Crawley?
I'm sorry.
please,
I was thinking about my daughter.
her death just...
Taylor Shane was your daughter?
I became her legal guardian when she was 15.
we've been through a lot together, but...
were you aware that she had a drug problem?
Taylor's been clean and sober for over two years now.
she OD'd on PCP.
no, no. There's no way. She would never go through that again.
statistically, addicts fall back in times of stress.
meaning Marine boot camp probably wasn't the best environment for her.
this entire reality series was Taylor's idea.
I've never seen her happier. She loved it here.
how did she get the drugs?
she didn't.
the whole point of the show was to show that she wasn't that girl anymore.
well, I'd say it backfired, large time.
it's "big" time.
get up!
let's go! Move!
come on. Show me what you're made of!
come on now. Just two more!
I can't do it anymore!
what did I tell you about the word "can't,"Bressling?!
Taylor's the only one who took any of this Marine stuff seriously.
but you knew that, right, Sarge?
get the cameras out of here.
Yes, sir. Back it up, guys.
was he here?
answer me, Hannah.
you're hurting her arm, sir.
my daughter's dead, Staff Sergeant. If she's responsible, I'll do more than that.
Hey, no one's doing anything around here but calming down.
who is "he"?
Noah Keller, Taylor's ex.
Noah Keller, he was here?
a couple of days ago. Big deal.
did you know this?
no, sir.
staff Sergeant, can you take Mr. Crawley for a walk? We need to talk to the girls alone.
you need to let NCIS handle it.
I'll talk to you when they're done.
we'll be here, Tom. We don't wrap for another three days.
is that Berry Mango Madness?
Yes.
we haven't had anything but Marine food since we got here.
I'll give you a hundred bucks for it.
it's not for sale.
it's free.
just like love.
you know, I'm a big fan of the show.
you guys are really beautiful and great and the show is excellent.
Thanks, cutie.
why didn't you tell me that Taylor's boyfriend had visited her?
she made us promise not to say anything.
well, you know, she's dead, so I don't think she'll mind.
you saw the way Tom reacted.
he hates Noah. He blames him for Taylor's drug habit.
was she using while she was here?
considering we're in a Marine boot camp, no. None of us have used any drugs.
Noah just came to talk to her. They were having some relationship problems.
Taylor thought he was using again.
what?
it just makes sense.
someone gave her enough PCP to kill the three of you.
when was the last time you heard from Mr. Keller?
hang up the phone, McGee.
boss, I'm on the phone with Noah Keller's accountant.
he's at the Cranston Motel in Triangle, Virginia right outside the main gate at Quantico.
how'd you track him down?
I got an urgent call from the President.
his AMEX records were in the fax machine, McGee.
come on.
I specifically told her to e-mail those.
millions of dollars, supermodel girlfriend, this is where he stays?
well, he showed up in style.
I think I would have rather slept in the car.
that one.
Yeah, Gibbs?
boss,
Noah Keller was in Quantico the day before Taylor Shane died.
Yeah, I see him now, DiNozzo.
don't bother, McGee.
a young person's death is never easy, McGee, but two in 24 hours, and both self-afflicted, well, that's... tragic.
he got off easy, Duck.
drugs he gave his girlfriend had her thrashing herself to death in a barbed-wire fence.
these people can have everything, and this is how they end up?
well, wealth and fame have often gone hand in hand with fatal addiction.
Edgar Allan Poe, Keith Moon.
Kurt Cobain.
Yeah, the list goes on and on.
this one's been dead about 24 hours, Jethro.
Yeah, well, that means he offed himself the same night his girlfriend O. D.'d.
well, the froth around the mouth suggests a breakdown of the nervous system.
PCP?
Yeah, possible, but not probable. Look.
pinpoint pupils, blue discoloration around the fingernails.
no, I'd say his death was the result of diacetylmorphine.
heroin.
Yeah. I would say you're right, Ducky.
that a suicide note?
not exactly.
it's time for us to realize that this just isn't meant to be.
please know that it was never my intention to hurt you.
I will always remember the great times we've had.
this is a Dear John letter.
postmarked six days ago from Quantico Post Office.
handwriting checks out.
Taylor Shane sent it.
Yeah. Noah Keller came by to chat about it.
very Romeo and Juliet.
Yeah, except for the part where he feeds her a toxic Klowny Kake and offs himself.
this must have been a very difficult letter for her to write.
probably harder for him to read. No one likes getting dumped by postal express.
maybe he didn't listen. Relationships change.
some people don't know when to let go.
I have to brief the C. G of Quantico first thing in the morning on this, and I'd like you to be there when I do that.
negative, Jen- all we have is circumstantial evidence so far.
we don't even have anything to tie the two deaths together yet.
well, I can't call the general and tell him we have nothing.
you can always write him a letter.
they're for you.
they're really black.
really, really... black.
it's pretty cool, huh?
Yeah.
get Well Soon?
they didn't have a card that said...
sorry I almost sent you to prison at the flower shop.
almost? You actually did send me to prison.
well, not for good.
Abby... I don't know what to say, Abby.
these... Just say that you don't hate me.
I could never hate you. I don't think anyone could ever hate you.
Oh, you don't know Billy Bob.
you... gave him black roses?
no. I gave him two black eyes.
he tried to run over me with a Harley Fatboy when I was sleeping in the living room.
a guy rode a motorcycle through your living room?
Yeah. No. Well, it was his living room, my Harley.
Billy Bob had, um, intimacy issues.
don't forget to water them, or they'll die.
I thought they already were dead.
laugh now, cry later.
it's an interesting concept, Mr. Palmer.
unfortunately for our guest here, the laughter has ended.
my friend who went to NYU said this guy was the club king of New York.
he was almost legendary.
well, if he wasn't before, he most certainly is now.
and apparently, he only went out with models and A-list celebrities.
this guy got the VIP treatment everywhere he went.
you writing a gossip column, Palmer?
I- I was just informing Dr. Mallard that he... that he...
we... I...
talk to me, Duck.
our initial assumptions were far from correct.
when I examined him just now,
I found fresh bruises on his upper back, the left shoulder.
the X rays indicated a severe fracture of the left scapula and a clavicle that was almost completely crushed.
he was in a fight?
Yeah. Well, injuries of that nature, his left arm would be completely useless.
someone else shot him up.
well, Abby's tox screen showed that Mr. Keller had a blood-alcohol level of 0.34.
his heart was pumping so slowly that most of the heroin was never even metabolized.
he was passed out.
Yes. I'm afraid our young man was unconscious when the drug was administered.
from Abby?
I thought this show was just mindless entertainment.
it's called research, Tony. And I'm merely looking for a lead.
well, this is only the beginning.
before you know it, you'll be sitting at home eating a large box of chocolates, watching the Food Network on your 50-inch plasma.
we're not all so easily corrupted. Take McGee, for example.
he's been raised in America his entire life, and he rarely turns the television on.
tell him, McGee.
Yeah, tell him, McGee.
w- Well, uh...
depends what you consider "rarely."
I might watch 20 minutes here or there.
tell her what you do the rest of the time, Probie.
it's not TV.
he pretends to be a fairy in an online computer game.
it's an elf lord.
whatever.
Keller didn't commit suicide, he was murdered.
what the hell are you two doing? Find out why.
Hey, uh, I got to call you back.
boss, I think I might have something.
are you waiting for me to guess... elf lord?
no. Sorry. Um,
I was searching through Noah Keller's cell phone records.
the night that he died, he received three calls.
two were from his business manager, the other was from Hannah Bressling.
I've known Noah since high school.
we used to sneak into the Limelight, like, every weekend.
Limelight- that's, uh, that club in Chelsea.
Yeah. You been?
actually, no, I, uh...
I saw it on Wild On.
sounded like it was a pretty exclusive place.
even as a kid, Noah seemed to know all the right people.
I don't think he waited in line his entire life.
money tends to open doors.
Oh, he didn't use his dad's money as a crutch.
Really?
Yeah, everyone always assumed that he was popular only because he was rich and...
that that was the reason he dated models.
I'm sure it didn't hurt.
no, women liked Noah because he was charismatic and interesting.
I mean, most guys that come from money are womanizers whose life revolves around their car.
were you and Noah ever an item?
we dated on and off for a couple of years, but...
we sort of lost touch when he hooked up with Taylor.
when did he get involved with drugs?
people say he got her started, but it's not true.
they both made that leap together.
did you speak to him when he came to see Taylor?
no. He was, um, drunk and really upset.
but I called him later that night just to make sure that he was safe.
I just can't imagine why anyone would have wanted to hurt him.
what are you doing?
I just stopped by to drop you something off, Jethro.
looked to me like you were playing agent.
I left you four messages today.
Really?
I only got three.
Noah Keller's death was murder, not suicide.
that's something I should probably know.
it sounds like you do.
this case is getting more attention by the hour. I trust...
that you will keep me informed.
trust is a two-way street.
what are you saying, Jethro, you don't trust me?
of course I trust you.
is that all?
for now.
I can save you the trouble.
on today's Channel Six News, per Director Shepard's demands,
Cynthia Sanchez issued a retraction on Monday's story.
she was also forced to issue a public apology to one Leroy Jethro Gibbs.
our director has friends in high places, yes?
something I can do for you, Officer David?
Abby needs to see you. Said she found something.
I looked through all the Boot Camp Babes footage from the night Taylor Shane died.
she was nowhere to be seen.
she knew where the cameras were placed. Also knew how to avoid them.
not all of them. A few minutes ago, I found this.
it's from a Quantico security camera that was placed on top of the mess hall.
this video was taken about two hours before Taylor Shane died.
I presume not many people stroll around Quantico at 1: 00 a. m.
can you zoom in, Abs?
my new enhancer program is booting up as we speak.
I've been waiting for the chance to bust out this bad boy.
this should clear it up a bit.
Taylor was with Staff Sergeant McMannis?
when's Gibbs planning on starting?
this is one of his techniques.
Really?
leaves the guy alone in a cold, dimly lit room.
and then, just as the guy starts to zone out, bursts in the door and rifles off some questions.
I call it "rock the baby."
I see.
and does it work?
Oh, just watch.
in a few moments, that door's going to fly open and this big, bad Marine is going to jump like a little girl.
what the hell's with you, DiNozzo?
nothing. Uh...
I was just telling Ziva about your interrogation techniques.
I'm not interrogating McMannis. You are.
Ooh, thanks, boss.
you know, I could've used a little more prep time...
I'm not talking to you, DiNozzo.
he is all yours, Officer David.
you are aware that I've never performed an interrogation without inflicting some sort of pain.
this footage was pulled from a Quantico security camera.
it was taken at 0117.
the morning Taylor Shane was murdered.
it's an interesting technique.
she doesn't want to tempt herself.
tell me what you know, Staff Sergeant.
okay if I dip, ma'am?
I promised Taylor I'd quit.
we're both addicted to nicotine.
a supermodel who spits tobacco?
she smoked, but it's against the rules at boot camp.
so you supplied her with your snuff there?
Yes, ma'am.
and junk food?
sometimes.
and the midnight walks?
you did that with every girl,
staff Sergeant?
no, just Taylor.
we didn't want anybody to find out about us until the show ended.
find out what?
that we were in love, ma'am.
this is the worst defense imaginable.
the idea of a supermodel falling in love with a guy like this.
okay, why is that?
well, it's absolutely ridiculous, you know?
supermodels date guys like George Clooney, or guys with George Clooney's bank account or, of course, the actual George Clooney, but not guys like this.
they don't date guys like this.
definitely not guys like this.
meaning, Marines, DiNozzo?
no, I didn't say that.
I mean, I would never say that.
he thought I meant Marines.
Yeah. Gibbs.
I got something for you.
I'll be right there.
Abby's got something.
Hey, you were a lot of help.
Taylor was nothing like her reputation.
she was, she was... normal, like a regular girl.
I know it sounds weird, ma'am, but I fell in love with her the moment I met her.
and she felt the same way?
we were going to get married once the show ended.
she was done with modeling.
she... she was sick of the whole lifestyle.
and the reason you failed to mention you were with her a few hours before she died?
who'd have believe me, ma'am?
hell, it was my life.
I barely believe it myself.
I believe you.
you do?
so I'm free to go?
no.
I think we will charge you with murder instead.
but you just... you said you believed me, ma'am.
I would never, ever have done anything to hurt her.
what about the man who supplied Taylor with the drugs that killed her?
answer the question, Staff Sergeant.
I'm not feeling too well, ma'am.
this is the final wardrobe of Taylor Shane.
could not imagine a worse way to go.
I could.
she planted herself on a barbed-wire fence. What could possibly be worse?
my top three are falling into a wood chipper, drowning in lava, and being eaten by a shark.
guessing you've thought about this before.
on and off for the last 25 years.
you know, I read a statistic that says you're more likely to be struck by lightning than attacked by a shark.
not if you're a seal.
what do we have, Abs?
I broke down the origin of each and every stain on Taylor's clothes.
most are blood, mud, rust, and sweat.
most?
Yes. This stain here, under the collar, has traces of PCP mixed with formaldehyde, sodium and nicotine.
tobacco. - Yep.
the PCP wasn't laced in the Klowny Cake.
it was laced in this.
are you sure you don't want some more water, Staff Sergeant?
I... I have to leave here now!
sit down, Staff Sergeant.
what are you doing to me?!
I believe Officer David asked you to sit down.
you did this to me!
you're trying to destroy me!
the guy just went crazy, boss.
he's ODing on PCP.
get a medical team in here, DiNozzo.
Where'd you get the chew, Sergeant?
sergeant!
from the show.
what's happening to me, sir?
you've been drugged.
but you'll be alright now.
hush.
this is what I would call some serious snuff.
the Staff Sergeant's chew was laced with 400 milligrams of PCP.
a typical hit for a user would be between seven and ten milligrams.
I knew that dude could've have taken me if he wasn't juiced.
what are his chances, Abby?
depends on how much PCP he ingested.
how long was he dipping?
that long, huh?
let's just hope he has better luck than Taylor Shane.
okay, great. Thank you.
staff Sergeant McMannis is stable at Bethesda. Still in critical condition.
any prints?
I was able to lift two latent prints.
one matches Staff Sergeant McMannis...
and the other? - No owner yet.
but it does match a print lifted from Noah Keller's syringe.
whoever killed Taylor, killed Keller.
what's that for?
it's a fingerprint kit.
Why?
someone tried to kill Staff Sergeant McMannis today.
his chewing tobacco was laced with PCP. Whoever did it left a print on the can.
the same person who murdered Taylor Shane and Noah Keller.
whoa. You think it was one of us?
Oh, we know it was one of you.
you were always jealous of her, Hannah. You're also the one who introduced her to Keller.
me, jealous of a crackhead?
please, Tom, you're stretching it a bit.
but why would we? That doesn't make any sense.
Taylor Shane was in love with the staff sergeant.
Yeah, right. You've got to be joking.
no, we're not.
well, then fingerprint away, sweetheart. It wasn't me.
we don't need it. They're already on your arrest record.
from the time you beat up your assistant with a cell phone, I believe?
well, it wasn't me.
Nope. We've got yours, too.
Yeah. Remember that time you drove your SUV through the front of Limelight?
whoa. What is this?
I-I loved Taylor.
wait a minute. I'm not giving you permission to take my fingerprints. I want to talk to my lawyer first.
we don't need anybody's permission. You're under arrest for murder.
you didn't want Taylor to give up her career to marry a Marine, but you couldn't stop her.
too bad she was addicted to nicotine, too.
you killed your own daughter?
it was an accident!
what was I supposed to do? She was going to throw her life away. Be some...
be some jarhead's housewife!
Thanks, Tom.
what's so funny, honey?
the ratings on this one will really be through the roof.
Ziva, no, no, no, no.
you really find her attractive?
Oh, yeah.
well, I want to shoot her.
Tony, it's a matter of opinion. How can I be wrong?
exactly. It's a matter of you having the wrong opinion.
why don't you two just agree to disagree?
I don't agree to that.
boss, the director's new hair, you like the way she cut it short?
she cut her hair?
never mind.
so when you say you're sure,
Yeah, but what if you're wrong?
J. B.trust me, the girl's into you.
Hey, careful!
Ah, relax.
this guy's a Marine.
before he deployed himself through his windshield.
so what do I say to her?
I don't know. What do I look like, the Cyrano de what's-his-face guy?
go with your gut.
you got the release?
no, didn't you get it?
you know what? On second thought, maybe you better not go with your gut.
so where should I take her?
I'm gonna start charging you or advice, you know?
Oh, there she is.
you smell that?
gas.
Oh, no.
get out.
get out, get out, get out!
go, go, go!
what are you doing?
I'm in the middle of a very serious negotiation.
on McGee's computer?
I know where you're going with this.
and the answer is yes.
and what's the question?
have I no shame?
who are you IMing?
agent Larson?
and she thinks you're MGee?
and this is because she warned you that if you spoke to her again, she would have you brought up on sexual harassment charges.
that was a misunderstanding.
Oh, so now you're correcting the record.
I'm just trying to let her know that I...
McGee feels that she may have misjudged me, and...
that's a close, personal friend, I can...
vouch for Tony's strength of character.
I don't have much time.
she's being reassigned in two days.
Yeah, well, you'll be reassigned if Gibbs catches you.
doing what?
uh, we were looking at McGee's bookmarks, trying to get an idea for a...birthday present.
morning.
happy birthday, Probie.
it's a bagel.
um, not my birthday.
grab your gear.
medical transport just exploded.
any day now, Probie.
Yep, sorry.
I just got the strangest IM.
she asked you out?
you?
trust me, I'm just as surprised as you are.
trust me, you're not.
blast radius indicates a low-yield detonation.
she say why?
uh...
it said that she liked the loyalty I showed my coworkers.
pyrolysis on the pavement suggests O2 was the primary accelerant.
even if they were total scum.
no idea what she was referring to.
I'll tell you, though, did not realize she was paying so much attention to me.
you want to tell the Probie or should I?
how about neither?
why don't you just focus on the work?
Yeah, I've noticed you've morphed into quite the forensic expert.
I'm Israeli.
this isn't my first exploding ambulance.
we left the van unattended for four, maybe five minutes tops.
as soon as Patto hit the brakes...
the whole thing exploded into flames.
I think someone's trying to kill us.
would you please stop that, J.B?
it was, it was an accident.
who's trying to kill you?
who knows?
there's a lot of weirdoes out there.
tell me about it.
talk to me, Duck.
lance Corporal William Danforth, Jr.
survived IEDs in Iraq,
RPGs in Afghanistan.
unfortunately, the local odocoileus virginianus was too much to bear.
that's a white-tailed... - Deer.
Yeah, I know.
you saying Bambi killed this Marine, Ducky?
no.
but swerving at 60 miles an hour into a tree to avoid Bambi did.
his girlfriend is still in a coma at the hospital.
Danforth was DOA when they brought him in last night.
this morning, he was on his way to Bethesda for a routine autopsy - when fate intervened. - Fate?
the scorching of the body is consistent with a gasoline fire accelerated by onboard oxygen.
this could have been an accident, Jethro.
lucky for those two to get out.
Yeah. Lucky in a way I don't like.
good morning, good morning
morning.
good...
good morning to you. You, you, you. Good...
Ooh, what's that?
looks like an iPod.
ipod photo.
anyone who might have possibly had a motive to try to kill them...
either has an alibi or is out of town.
way ahead of you.
you could have told me and saved me the trouble.
just say you need the practice and leave it at that.
what kind of music does the McGee listen to?
Ooh, Barry Manilow?
let's go to photos.
what are you doing?
well, McGee had a date with Agent Larson last night.
didn't return any of my e-mails about a sit-rep.
maybe he took some photos.
those are his private photos.
well, he left them on his public desk.
Where's the clicker?
who is this?
well, it's definitely not Agent Larson.
got to be his sister. - Why?
you kidding?
this girl's way out of McGeek's league.
I don't think the drivers were the target, Tony.
I actually think it was the body.
why blow up a dead guy?
put it back up there.
put what back?
McGee's got good taste.
going for coffee.
what was that for?!
alerting DiNozzo.
the fuel line to the gas tank cap is ruptured here.
torn by a loose bolt on the differential housing.
loosened how? - Unknown.
the van also had a short in the electrical system, coincidentally, in the taillight right by our ruptured fuel line.
you know how I feel about coincidences, Abs.
equatorial pygmies know how you feel about coincidences, Gibbs.
so one would wonder:
accident or not an accident?
that is the question.
our first player:
an innocent differential housing bolt that is rubbing and straining on the molecular bonds of our vulcanized fuel line, until, after eons, our hapless hose finally ruptures.
the gas moves quickly into the floorboard of the van when it's in motion.
the driver smells it.
what could it be?
he hits the brakes, and the short in the taillight ignites the pooling gas vapors.
the flames quickly superheat the onboard O2.
and when the canisters can no longer contain the growing pressure, - Kaboom! - Not an accident.
not unless the Angel of Death is going through a Rube Goldberg stage.
boss, we found remnants of what may have been the trigger on an O2 canister.
may have been, McGee?
there were traces of mercury fulminate, sodium azide and tryl on the material.
blasting cap.
O2 would have never blow on its own.
fire wasn't hot enough.
the perp rigged the transport to make it look like an accident.
might have gotten away with it if he had detonated it sooner.
fire dispersed pieces of the trigger.
he waited for the drivers to get out.
so he's not a murderer.
well, uh, at least he wasn't trying to kill the ambulance drers.
trace it.
Gibbs, this is a garden-variety laminated paper substrate.
it's used as a cheap shielding in thousands - of electronic devices. - Yeah. So?
so, maybe I should get back to work.
did we get a positive match on our Marine's DNA?
you know, I've been a little busy here, Gibbs, with all the rubbing and the looking and the analyzing and the...
I should mention that Ducky's taking care of it.
I haven't seen a body this badly burned since the Bertram Mills' circus.
specimen jar.
Mr. Palmer?
sorry, Doctor.
just having a problem with the smell today.
Really?
I think he smells like my mother's fried chicken.
Yeah, that would be the problem.
Oh, I see.
well, the vegetarian lifestyle has been medically proven to be the healthiest of choices.
perhaps it's time you made the jump.
you wanted to see me, Duck?
well, actually, yes, Jethro.
then why do you look surprised to see me?
because I haven't told you that I wanted to see you.
Yes, well.
our latest houseguest has thrown us quite the little mystery.
define "mystery."
Yeah, well, the young lad's death certificate lists blunt-force thoracic trauma as the cause of death.
typical in motor vehicle accidents.
but I've only partially been able to verify that, since, as you can see, the postmortem damage is extensive.
Ducky. - Yes?
mystery.
Ah, of course.
well, you know me, Jethro.
I attempted to make an identification myself.
the blast destroyed his jaw and shattered his teeth.
it would take an inordinate amount of time to get an identification from dental records.
also, the fire so degraded his DNA that, you know, I spent the better part of yesterday - scouring his body. - Mystery.
uh, almost there.
by a stroke of luck,
I found a piece of tissue viable enough to send to have run against Danforth's DNA at the Armed Forces Repository.
this isn't William Danforth, Jr.
then who is this?
that, my dear Jethro, is the mystery.
lance Corporal Danforth's pro and cons were Five-Oh Five-Oh.
a real squirreled-away Marine.
so, what'd you find, Tony?
he's the Master of the Pan Flute.
it's helping me think.
what are you thinking?
I'm thinking that there are a lot of reasons for post-mortem mutilation you're overlooking, besides hiding a suspicious cause of death.
such as?
such as, enraged acts of violence, sadistic curiosity.
trying to hide the real identity of the victim.
that was the next one on my list.
is his identity in question? - Yeah, it is now.
Tony, get me a copy of that...
the names of the cops who processed Danforth's crime scene report. Already on its way, boss.
Ziva, take McGee and... - Have a chat with the doctor who pronounced the body dead, find out who made the I. D.
Hey, you want me to go and supervise that, boss?
actually, you know, I'll stay here just in case you need me.
Zamfir.
not- Not saying you need me.
that's a bad word.
need's the wrong word.
the Director needs to see you in her office ASAP.
I was just going to tell the Director you're here.
Cynthia, did you know that when a Roman emperor made a triumphal march into Rome, he had a slave on his chariot who...
who whispered, "You're only human into his ear." -Going in unannounced is whispering into her ear.
so, you're the Director's slave?
Cynthia is there to direct traffic, Agent Gibbs.
I'm just responding to your ASAP, Director.
this is Lance Corporal Danforth's father, William.
my sympathies, Mr. Danforth.
thank you, Agent Gibbs.
the SecNav would like us to keep Mr. Danforth in the loop throughout the entire investigation.
more than usual?
Yes.
gordo and I served together in Beirut, Agent Gibbs, and quite frankly,
I'm using that friendship.
wouldn't you?
he would.
sixth or Eighth?
two- Six. Fox Company.
one- One. Scout Sniper Platoon.
Beirut?
desert Storm.
so, what can you tell me about my son, Agent Gibbs?
only what I read in the hospital and police reports.
Mr. Danforth has seen those.
he's asking how his son's body was incinerated.
it wasn't.
AFIS couldn't match the body in autopsy with Lance Corporal Danforth's DNA.
you're saying that it isn't Mr. Danforth's son?
not according to AFIS.
could there be a mistake?
one in nine million.
have Abby rerun the DNA. - Already on it, Director.
who the hell is it?
I'll let you know when I find out.
what should I tell his mother?
I wouldn't tell her anything yet.
right.
my numbers.
director Shepard, I'll tell Gordo how cooperative you've been.
least we could do.
Hey, Bill?
did you identify your son's body?
no. The, um...
police notified us that he had died, said that his body was being shipped to Bethesda.
do you think Billy could still be alive?
I think the hospital transported the wrong body.
bull.
the Marine from two nights ago, Danforth?
Yeah, I remember him.
are you the one who treated him?
treated? No.
unfortunately, all I did was pronounce him dead, Agent McGee.
it's hard to believe it's the same kid.
why is that?
he was a mess.
heavy contusions to the cranium.
pronounced facial lacerations. Half his skull caved in.
who ID'd his body?
a buddy gave us the tentative I. D.
and, uh, we also pulled his license from his wallet.
his buddy have a name?
I can do better than that. He's in ICU room five.
the police report didn't mention anything about a third injured party, Doctor.
that's because he wasn't injured, Officer David.
he's visiting.
our souls are like those orphans whose unw-wedded mothers die in bearing them.
the secret of our p... pat...
paternity lies in their graves and we must there to learn it.
herman Melville, Moby Dick.
call me Ishmael.
it's her favorite book.
doctors said it- it might help.
it's helping me a headache.
you're Rebecca's relatives?
uh, no. NCIS.
corporal Merrill, sir.
uh, at-at ease, Marine.
we're only here to ask you - a few questions. - Oh, of course, sir.
I...I mean ma'am.
man, she doesn't like being called ma'am.
it's okay, though.
this about Billy, Ma... Miss?
if you mean Lance Corporal Danforth, yes.
we understand that you ID'd his body.
tried.
Billy's face was all m- mashed up.
how did you know it was him?
who else c- could it be?
he was in the car with Rebecca.
this was the last time I saw them.
which was?
the night they were killed.
tell us about the night.
Billy had just landed stateside after his second "tour in Iraq," so...
me, him and, uh, Rebecca, Billy's girlfriend.
we were out celebrate go at- at the Gold Monkey.
you're a good friend.
m- Me and Billy b-been brothers since we was this big.
he was the only one who never made fun of my stutter.
you saw Lance Corporal Danforth get into the car?
I put him in it.
p- P... passed the a-accident on my way on.
uh, cops were already there.
said Billy's car hit a d... deer...
it's okay, Corporal.
we read the police report.
he was just lying there, all b...
uh, broken and be-bent up.
they were trying to, uh, uh...
save him, but I knew.
I- I just... I knew he was, uh...
doctor said he probably didn't feel anything.
think he was tellng the truth, or just trying- trying to make me feel better?
doctors do that, don't they?
well, in my experiences,
E. R. doctors- they usually tell it like it is.
you got a favorite movie, huh? Got a favorite movie?
who's your Daddy now?
are you having fun, DiNozzo?
Ah. All done interviewing Danforth's C. O?
you done interviewing his platoon?
nothing builds rapport like a good game of ball.
that's the name of the game...
Thanks, guys.
the guys said Danforth was a top Marine, but the word is, he only joined because his father was a Marine.
little looser, please.
my toes have gotten used to the whole, uh, blood thing, circulation.
word also is that, he was inseparable with another Marine, a- a Corporal...
kenneth Merrill. Yeah.
he followed Danforth into the Corps on the buddy program.
course he did.
the guy's as loyal as a Saint Bernard.
would you just focus, please?
and I'm starting to lose feeling in my pinky toe.
does that look right? - Yeah.
apparently, he was as loyal as a Saint Bernard.
according to his C. O. the Corps worked out pretty well for him.
Oh, yeah, he got into boxing, got his first girlfriend, and get this- turns out he had a knack for disarming IEDs.
his platoon called him the...
Forrest Gump of explosives.
I'm not trying to do your job, am I?
put an ice pack on that. 15 on...
15 off. Yeah, I know the drill.
Thanks, Corpsman.
Ooh, it's real swollen. I don't think I'm going to be able to walk on this thing, boss.
look at that.
look, it's a miracle.
Yeah. Loyal as a Saint Bernard.
I always wanted to get one of those until I found out they didn't come with that barrel of whiskey around their neck.
you're wondering if Merrill helped his buddy fake his own death to get out of the Corps?
no. I'm wondering who they got to play the part of the dead body.
you really think Lance Corporal Danforth?
you got a better theory?
actually, we do, Tony.
I'd like to hear it, Agent McGee.
and yours as well, Agent DiNozzo.
both preferably sometime today.
we think Corporal Merrill may have killed Danforth, Director.
Why?
merrill conveniently forgot to tell us about the fight they had the night,
Danforth was killed.
a fight over what?
Gibbs is not going to like this.
there a problem, Agent McGee?
uh, no, no, ma'am.
merrill claims that he was trying to stop him from drinking and driving.
according to the bar tender, they broke two tables and a chair over it.
sounds like more than two good friends fighting to me.
I agree.
merrill also passed Danforth's accident on the way home.
he could have easily finished him off.
Nope. -Merrill goes to hide the body.
when he comes back to clean up, the cops are already on scene.
what about the other body?
there was a third party in the car.
we only have Corporal Merrill's word that the two of them drove off.
Tony. No way.
wrong.
merrill shows up at the hospital, confirms the false I. D.
then, later, goes back, torches the ambulance before the real I. D. can be made.
no. Okay, I'm sorry. I got to interrupt.
because...
here's the thing.
I have a theory that actually has motive which might be helpful.
I don't meant to belittle my colleagues efforts, but I am a senior field agent.
Danforth didn't hit a deer.
he hit Ducky's John Doe.
stick with me here.
he's drunk, right?
wasted, looking at five to ten for manslaughter.
so he switches the John Doe with his body, then skips town, right?
and then he has his buddy, Corporal Merrill, come along and torch the evidence.
that's how it happened.
it's pretty simple.
it's really just detective work.
connecting the dots...
Hey, boss, I was just...
the Director wanted... she wanted...
with me. - Okay.
dramatic.
but duly noted, Agent Gibbs.
I get it.
that wasn't the way looked, boss.
I know.
the Director kind of suckered me into that deal.
Ziva caved first.
I didn't cave in. I was trying...
McGee next. - It wasn't...
and my loyal St. Bernard held out till last.
well, I... Probably all of 30 seconds.
so what is my team?
can I call you my team?
Yeah, of course.
what are you going to do now?
well, I think we should... - We...we could...
to solve the case?!
Tony, you impound... - Danforth's car.
have Abby see if it hit anything beside a tree.
then you and McGee...
go to the original crash site.
McGee, I want an agent standing by Rebecca Crawford's room to get...
a statement. The second she wakes up, boss.
you got it.
and I'm with you, yes?
I don't know, Ziva.
are you?
definitely.
the improvised explosive device, gentlemen.
the weapon of choice in Iraq and Afghanistan.
the problem is spotting them when they look something like this.
now these are just a few of the IED configurations,
I encountered on my last pump in Iraq.
today, I'm going to teach you how to locate, disarm, or if need be, blow them all in place.
corporal, you've got it.
take it over. They're yours.
gentlemen, you heard Corporal Merrill.
give me a huddle.
can I... can I help you, sir?
did you know that lying to a federal investigator is a crime?
I didn't lie.
what was the fight in the Gold Monkey about?
Billy was drunk, sir.
I tried to take his car keys away.
he started swinging.
I guess I didn't try h- hard enough.
you told me you placed him inside the car.
I did.
Billy m- must have made Becca pull over.
I should have... have...
you should have taken him home yourself.
Yeah.
Billy's dead, because of m... me.
are you sure he's dead?
the burned body isn't Lance Corporal Danforth.
enough already.
you know I'm not the type to kiss and tell.
kiss?
I heard from a reliable source that you were out with Agent Larsen last night until about 2: 00 a. m.
who told you that?
I have information you want, you have information I want.
shall we dance?
forget it.
real mean always kiss and tell.
okay, so what are we looking for that the cops didn't already find?
they thought it was an accident.
but they were not using the honed eye of a highly trained federal agent.
probie, bring one of those numbers.
a prescription bottle of ibuprofen.
grunt candy. A marine's best friend.
must have been thrown from Danforth's car.
so?
so, it belonged to Corporal Merrill.
and there's blood on it.
come on.
say it.
say what?
you were right, Tony.
you'll be the bigger woman for it.
I'll just have to content myself being the...
well, the righter one.
woman?
you know what I mean.
I found Merrill's scrip at the scene, which means they were in it together.
and the DiNozzo body swap theory takes the lead.
what if he dropped it while killing Danforth?
Abby found Danforth's blood all over the windshield and the hood.
so much for your body swap theory, Tony.
I've seen more than a few people survive the windshield taste test, Ziva.
give it up, Tony.
you said Merrill was the Forrest Gump of explosives.
who else had the equipment and expertise to blow the up ambulance?
Ziva's right. Bring him in.
feeling pretty smug, aren't you?
Oh, yes, very.
so what's bugging that famous gut now?
Yes, you're that easy to read.
I learned how to speak "Gibbs" a long time ago.
you going to Abby's lab or autopsy?
Abby's. - Not to work my case.
I have the right to dig in to any NCIS investigation -that I want to. - Not mine.
unless you want me behind your desk again.
of course...
you could just observe and keep quiet.
fine.
as you know, this is the only piece of the trigger that I found.
I'm not really here.
do you know how long I've been waiting to cross over into an alternate dimension?
well, you're still here, Abs, for now.
what is this?
that's laminated paper substrate, boss, found in any number of electronic devices.
unfortunately I couldn't find a trace of a single one. But then,
I was surfing around on my favorite origami web ring and it hit me.
origami.
the ancient art of paper folding.
maybe the laminated substrate was the trigger.
you telling me Merrill folded himself a bomb?
no, that's impossible.
it came pre-folded.
see, several companies have been exploring the use of paper circuit boards for disposable products.
metallic ink is printed on laminated paper and then folded into the desired shape.
I coated our burned substrate with a metallic iron particulate.
which would attach to any residual metallic ink still present.
and then I ran the whole thing through an X-ray to pick up on any latent patterns.
voila.
you're looking at a partial circuit board for a disposable cell phone.
any chance we can read the...?
any chance we can read the...?
call log.
call logs.
I'd have a better chance.
but I was able to pull a list of all the incoming calls to the hospital cell zone.
only three came in immediately prior to the explosion.
one of them was the priggering call Corporal Kenneth Merrill.
appreciate you meeting me, Bill.
sure.
how's she doing?
she's stable. Still in a coma.
you waiting to question her?
listen, the fire wasn't an accident.
how well do you know Corporal Kenneth Merrill?
he's like a son to me.
it wasn't an accident?
no.
the van was rigged to explode.
because Kenny defused IED's in Iraq, you think he had something to do with this.
no.
impossible.
her mother told me that Rebecca be used to be Kenny's girlfriend?
when they were children.
they've been best friends since elementary school.
the night of your son's accident, he was also in a fight.
my son liked to drink.
sometimes in excess.
Kenny was just trying to stop him from driving home drunk.
Kenny had nothing to do with this, Jethro.
it looks like the call that triggered the fire came from Kenny's cell phone.
what time was that?
09:00 about.
no, it wasn't Kenny.
he was with my wife and I from...
I don't know, since...
since before dawn up until at least noon.
Yeah, Gibbs.
Hey, boss, Corporal Merrill disappeared...
was that about my son?
no, Corporal Merrill.
after I questioned him, he walked out of the class he was teaching...
no one's seen him since.
we are partner?
thought hospital today?
OK.
Merrrill explosion ?
because for Merrill.
his son.
still alive.
either.
for real play you?
sorry.
dead.
it was an accident.
be hurt.
hospital.
wouldn't be the first time use them to keep out of the trouble.
thank you!
there's another possibility.
son.
because...
kill him.
wrong.
in the way, however went down,
Jethro will find Merrill,
like Ricky Ricardo.
okay, guys, got his ATM records, check his recent activity.
DPH.
Ricky Ricardo, last two weeks.
credit card records coming up.
tan! If I meant burnt umber,
I would have said burnt umber.
get... Whatever it is.
you know. You got some plaining to do, Lucy.
Hey, Boss. Just updating the BOLO on Merrill.
and checking the DMV to see to see if he's had any traffic violations recently.
and going through his financial records to try and pick up any leads off any recent purchases.
And?
and we can't find him.
but we're not going to give up until we do.
or die trying.
or die trying?
you had to put that in his head?
you wanted to see me, Duck?
Yes, I did. I was just about to call you.
small wonder DiNozzo is always looking over his shoulder.
I managed to put a couple of bits together.
yes... lower canine.
how long?
Oh, a week, maybe longer.
any odds of this reconstruction getting us an ID?
exceedingly long, but it's the only method I have for identifying these remains.
I've had long shots come in.
I- I once wagered a 500-to-one on the Irish Sweepstakes.
he fell at the first jump, but then recovered.
he fell at the second jump.
you'll never guess what happened next.
Yeah, Gibbs.
it's me, Gibbs!
you'll never guess what I found.
come on, Gibbs, guess!
I ran the prints from the bottle of Ibuprofen that Tony found at the Danforth accident site.
can I at least get a drum roll?
Ta- da.
pathetic.
prints?
the prescription belonged to Corporal Merrill.
all of the prints on the bottle belonged to Lance Corporal Danforth.
so?
merrill gave Danforth some of his grunt candy.
it wasn't grunt candy.
the bottle was empty, so I swabbed it and I ran it through the Mass Spec.
Cyclosporine/Azathioprine.
come on, Abs. In English.
they're antirejection drugs, Gibbs.
if Danforth was taking them, he's had a transplant.
the DNA I ran could be from a donor organ.
kind of turning me on.
I'm going to get another sample from Ducky.
this body could be Lance Corporal Danforth.
so urban myth.
Hey, Bill.
called your home.
wife said you were here.
you got bad news for me, don't you?
Yeah.
Where'd your son have his transplant?
does it matter?
no.
you can't stay in the Corps with a kidney transplant, Jethro.
who burned in the fire, Bill?
an unclaimed body at the hospital morgue scheduled for cremation.
I made a donation, they switched a toe tag and the County saved itself the cost of a cremation.
could have killed those EMTs, Bill.
no.
I didn't detonate that oxygen until they were clear.
Why?
your son was dead.
corps doesn't care if he had a transplant now.
they were more than friends.
they were a match.
corporal Merrill gave your son a kidney.
an autopsy would reveal the transplant.
I was afraid that the M. E. would run a DNA check on the donor organ.
and you can't be on active duty if you gave away a kidney.
the Corps means the world to that boy, Jethro.
it's his life, and he risked everything.
he risked it all to help out his best friend, my son.
he rigged an IED to burn... -I did that.
bill! - I'll swear I did it.
Kenny had nothing to do with this.
why'd he go UA? - He didn't go UA.
he was at my place.
the things that Kenny's teaching those Marine going to Iraq will save their lives, Jethro.
come on, let me take the hit on this one.
Where's your son's body?
at the hospital morgue.
come on.
I do apologize.
usually one scraping is sufficient, but you are so crispy.
that should satisfy Abby.
Ah, Jethro.
Abby told me about the transplant and her theory.
you buy it?
well...
it is possible.
my money's on your teeth, Duck.
get back to it.
as soon as I give this to Abby.
I'll do it.
I've never seen you break evidence protocol before.
you don't trust me, Duck?
well, that's not the point.
chain of evidence is chain of evidence.
you're right about that.
I'd slap DiNozzo silly if he did it.
Jethro, you surprise me.
must be getting old.
God.
yes...
that's incredible.
no need for a dental match now, Duck.
the odd on getting donor DNA from Danforth's body are astronomical.
alabama, 1954.
a nine-pound meteorite hits Annie Hodges.
the odds of getting hit by a meteorite?
astronomical.
no pun intended. But it happens.
and I'm going to be published again.
peachy for you, but we just lost our victim.
our suspect.
our theories.
we've been barking up the wrong tree the entire investigation.
bush.
sorry, bush.
we've been barking up the wrong... bush.
tree. So, who torched the ambulance and why?
don't look at me.
don't tell me.
well, yeah. Abby was right.
first test picked up donor DNA.
our John Doe is Lance Corporal Danforth.
good.
I mean, not good- a Marine is dead.
but good that the case is no longer ours.
I know what you're going to say, Jethro, and don't.
I want Lance Corporal Danforth's remains returned to his father and I want the case turned over to the Maryland arson investigators.
that will make Mr. Danforth happy, which will make the SecNav happy, which in turn, will make me very happy.
we have wasted 'ay too many of our resources already.
okay.
this is so Usual Suspects.
Tony, your dying words will be "I've seen this film."
Gibbs even looks a little bit like Gabriel Byrne.
okay, who is Gabriel Byrne?
an actor who boards a mysterious ship like this one searching for Keyser Soze.
another actor?
no.
Keyser Soze is a character in the film who may or may not exist.
I'm confused.
so am I.
and I saw the DVD twice.
sound of Music confuses you, Probie.
I love that movie.
one note and I will lock you in a room and make you listen to "It's a Small World" for 24 hours straight.
do we understand each other?
okay, next.
something out of order?
we have no record of Abog Galib ever entering the United States.
so?
his passport has Philadelphia entry and exit stamps, June of last year.
computer glitch?
or a forged passport.
Hey!
hell, I thought we were going to do this without a chase.
I could not be arrested, Agent...
I had to speak to you alone.
the situation has changed.
the head of Abu Sayyaf wants me to courier for him between Basilan and Pakistan.
bin Laden?
Allah be willing.
sorry if I made you run, huh?
Oh, I'd chase you to hell if it led to Bin Laden.
you only have to chase me off this ship.
has Abu infiltrated Sea Lift?
they're about to.
our radio man, Pinpin Pula, is Abu Sayyaf.
somehow, he got a billet on the Cape Fear.
well, the Cape Fear's a Sea Lift munitions transport.
she sails tomorrow to replenish Marine Expeditionary Strike Force 8 in the Red Sea.
he plans to blow the Cape Fear while it's off-loading ammo to an assault ship.
this will be as bad as 9/11.
and just as terrifying.
Galib, that's good work.
I will go off the stern.
fire a couple of rounds, just do not hit me.
Oh, my passport.
I'll alert my team.
don't want them to shoot you. - No, wait, wait.
he looks from the broken coffee cup on the floor.
looks to the photo on the wall.
looks...
what do we got?
blast victim. Superficial burns and abrasions.
pressure steady.
got a name? Gibbs.
he's an NCIS Agent.
all right, my count, on three.
agent Gibbs!
Agent...!
get him out of his gear!
let's go!
GCS is less than eight.
let's intubate.
20 milligrams of etomidate, 100 of succinylcholine.
right away. Skip the X ray.
go straight to CAT scan.
call CT. Come on, baby.
Ziva! What happened?
a bomb- one dead, one injured.
you'll need body suits, tweezers, and those, um, suction things.
turkey basters.
and many, many, many specimen jars.
DUCKY: You get that, Mr. Palmer?
Yes, Doctor.
here, allow me. Toda.
how badly is Jethro injured?
paramedics took him to emergency.
which hospital? Portsmouth?
they have a level one trauma center at Portsmouth.
I didn't ask.
you didn't ask?
no. Once the paramedics were on site, I had other priorities:
the possibility of more bombs, a crew to detain, a crime scene to secure...
McGee and Tony will know.
Ziva, I'm not implying that you don't care.
listen, I know you care!
I don't need reassurances, Doctor!
DUCKY: Very well, but I just want you to know that I know...
Ducky, drip it!
do you mean "drop it" or "zip it"?
american idioms drive me up the hall.
well, actually...
never mind.
one of the crew is missing,
the radio man, Pinpin Pula.
put out a BOLO.
any word on Jethro?
not yet.
Portsmouth Trauma said to call back in an hour.
Portsmouth. Good, good.
I'll get out that BOLO.
we have a suspect?
what kind of name is Pinpin?
Filipino.
in Tagalog it means "rice paddy dike."
don't say a word.
I thought that was quite an accurate translation.
condition of Special Agent Jethro Gibbs.
trauma One.
no condition listed yet.
you can't go in there, Director.
it's restricted...
...to medical personnel.
this isn't about turf, you know.
Oh, I know that.
it's about rules.
and one really big one is nonmedical people cannot enter Trauma One unless they're carried in.
get me a gurney.
that's good.
get me a gurney.
I like that.
I left a dinner at the White House to come here.
I'm impressed.
really, I am.
that still doesn't change the rules.
I was hoping I wouldn't have to resort to this.
shooting your way in?
don't be silly.
I don't have my weapon.
calling the President?
now, that would be overkill.
Hello? Condi?
Jenny. Any word yet?
no.
I don't have his condition yet. Well, why not?
the head nurse won't let me into Trauma.
let me speak with her.
Ethel Washington, madam. This is Condoleezza Rice.
Yes, madam.
thank you, Condi. You're welcome.
McGee said that Gibbs was in a bomb blast.
he tried to sound really calm, but I could hear the fear in his voice, and he should be afraid.
for Gibbs to be brought to a hospital in an ambulance, cannot be good. I had to come see for myself.
my hearse got a flat, as usual, so I got in a cab to go to the airport, and then I realized that, by the time I got to the terminal, and I bought a ticket, and I went through security, then I flew to Norfolk, and I got a cab here, it would be better just to stay in the cab that I was in, so I did that.
it cost a lot...
doesn't matter what it cost, because this is Gibbs.
I can't believe he's hurt. He's never hurt.
not hurt enough to go to a hospital.
he has to be dying to even go see a doctor.
Oh, my God.
he isn't dying, is he?
I don't know what I'd do.
positive thoughts, positive thoughts, positive thoughts.
okay, I know the rule is that you have to be family to go into Emergency, at least that's what they said when Uncle Charlie got his leg caught in a nutria trap.
but Gibbs and me, we're tighter than blood.
I know you need ID.
I have an ID in here.
I work at NCIS-- forensics, and ballistics, chemical analysis and DNA typing.
uh, here.
that's me, I promise.
I just, I had to be in court that day, but I swear, that is me.
you're a really, really good person.
you're gonna have to look in there sooner or later, McGee.
I already did.
uh- huh.
Ziva, I don't think I can go in there.
I know.
don't let Tony smell fear, or else he'll just...
Probie!
got a special job for you.
too late.
bomb dog took point on Rice Paddy Dike's footlocker.
tag and stow it in the truck for Abby, would you?
on it, boss.
I do love it when he calls me boss.
that why you're being nice to him?
nice?
not being nice.
lugging footlockers is probie work.
all right, I cut the probie some slack.
it's been a bad day.
Yes.
a very bad day.
what's the point of origin?
55-gallon oil drum.
that twisted ring is all that's left of it.
what is an oil drum doing in a laundry compartment?
well, ships clean them and reuse them for storage.
this one probably held dirty laundry.
very unsanitary.
fragments indicate a high explosive.
Abby should be able to trace the taggant.
Why's the head and torso intact when the rest of him's a slushie?
suicide bombers wearing an explosive belt look like this.
except there's always something left of their lower extremities.
you see a foot?
not even a tootsie.
a tootsie?
a toe.
although in my generation, tootsie also referred to one's sweetie pie.
sweetie pie?
any word from the hospital?
Jethro's critical, but stable.
Wh...
he wasn't in here when the bomb detonated, was he?
that corner.
well, how did he survive?
the washer and dryer shielded him from the main force of the blast.
ZIVA: It's raining.
he's suffered a concussion, but there are no signs of intracerebral hemorrhaging.
he's gonna be okay, though, right?
uh, he should be fine.
I don't want to hear "should be."
I want to hear "will be." Abby...
"should be" is not positive!
enough, Abs.
I want to see what's under the hood.
hold the sedation, and call me when he wakes.
I'm always positive, Ms. Sciuto, but with a concussion, until he...
until he wakes, no one knows what's going on inside his brain.
I'll miss you, Daddy.
we've said it all before.
I want to hear it again.
I will take care. I will come back safe.
not those words.
Shepard.
Yikes. Agent DiNozzo here.
Cynthia told me you stayed at the hospital.
is the boss awake?
I am, Agent DiNozzo.
you have a sit-rep for me?
I do, Director Shepard.
crime scene's been processed, evidence tagged.
remains are on their way to autopsy.
officer David and Special Agent McGee are questioning the crew.
we have an ID on the suspected bomber.
freighter's radio man, Pinpin Pula. Filipino.
suspected to be Abu Sayyaf.
a BOLO has been issued for his apprehension.
that is all I have to report, ma'am.
agent DiNozzo.
director.
I was out of line.
you are the Director, madam.
you cannot be out of line.
please. I was bitchy.
let me apologize.
I'm sorry.
if I may state an opinion, madam?
fire away.
never apologize. It's a...
sign of weakness.
I was his partner, too, DiNozzo.
I know all the Gibbsisms.
actually, he borrowed that one from the Duke.
said it to Joanne Dru in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.
Jethro's a lot like the Duke.
I keep waiting for him to say, "That'll be the day."
he said that in Paris to me once when I told him that I...
when we were working together.
shouldn't he be awake by now?
you know Gibbs.
he keeps his own schedule.
do you know what REM is?
sure, rapid eye movement.
happens when you're asleep and dreaming.
that's what it looks like he's doing right now.
Oh, well, that's got to be a good sign, right?
if it isn't a nightmare.
Gunny, they're both dead.
I'm terribly sorry, Jethro.
No!
how many times are you going to ask me the same question?
no smoking.
What'd he say?
McGee: Wait.
what- what'd you say?
that I understood him.
at least let my crew go ashore.
they've been at sea for two months.
excuse me. You don't appear to be the kind of captain who actually cares about the welfare of his crew.
that's it! I want to speak to Turkish consulate.
I can arrange that.
Yes!
if...
if NCIS agrees.
we do not.
learn anything, Ziva?
captain Mahir knows more than he's telling.
I know nothing.
that's very Sergeant Schultz.
hmm.
Tony, how's the boss?
I know nothing!
it's not funny, Tony.
McGee, it's the boss. He'll be fine.
with me.
he'll be living off coffee next.
Tony doesn't like coffee.
why do you suspect the captain?
he smokes expensive Havanas and wears a ten-carat diamond.
could be a zircon.
never doubt an Israeli about diamonds.
our Turk captain likes money.
the kind Abu Sayyaf pays to transport weapons, explosives and terrorists.
I'll flip you to see which of us takes the captain in and who visits Gibbs.
I'll take him in.
you don't speak Turkish.
your observations, Mr. Palmer?
well, fingerprints are out of the question.
I was rather hoping for something other than the obvious.
well, we'll have to use DNA to...
guess that's rather obvious, too.
uh- huh.
um, he was standing on the bomb.
better.
why standing? Well, it's seems to be the only way to explain his entire lower body being vaporized.
why not sitting?
uh... whatever he was sitting on would have shielded his butt.
unless his buttocks were sitting on the bomb.
who would sit on an explosive?
someone who didn't know they were sitting on the explosive.
of course.
did it myself once.
no. Twice.
first time I was young.
second time, foolish.
why were you sitting on an explosive, Doctor?
I just told you- I was young and foolish.
haven't you been listening?
I was...
I just... Specimen jar.
come on.
if I'm not mistaken,
Abby will find these to be fragments of the 55 gallon oil drum.
I must ask Jethro...
should I take these to Abby now, Doctor?
soon as I've taken a tissue sample for DNA confirmation.
is that really necessary, sir?
No!
no, it is not necessary.
we could match his teeth.
is that what you'd prefer?
a wise choice, Mr. Palmer.
coffee.
coffee?
sure way to wake Gibbs.
good idea.
but he's intubated.
we'll have to use the IV.
Ah.
thank you. Thank you.
uh, tell Ms. Sciuto that I didn't abandon Gibbs.
chief neurologist would have been here today anyway.
I'm sure she'll understand.
hope so. I like women with fire.
Ah. So the dog collar and that tats had nothing to do with it?
does he look in pain?
well, I don't know.
I've never seen Gibbs show pain, Director.
doctor, is he in pain?
doctor?
was this man a Marine?
Yes.
wounded in Desert Storm?
he has a Purple Heart.
that's it.
I treated him in Kuwait.
Gibbs never told me he was wounded in Desert Storm.
me, neither.
I saw his Purple Heart.
he was in a coma when we evaced him to Frankfurt.
you talk about.
but is he in pain?
certainly not extreme pain.
he may be hurting, but the only way to know is for him to tell us.
why not give him painkillers just in case?
I want him to wake up.
an opiate would only deepen his coma.
I've just never seen Jethro look like this.
I have.
that's why I remembered him.
that's the expression he had in '91.
it's more anguish than pain.
I want to gallop, Daddy!
no, Kelly.
Ah, let her go, Shannon.
I got a better chance of hooking up with Jessica Alba than these guys do of infiltrating Sea Lift.
every sailor has to go through a series of stringent security checks to be issued a special ID.
110 civilian crews, DiNozzo.
abu Sayyaf only needs to slip a man in one.
if Galib knew who that was or the name of the ship, why'd he run?
why didn't he just let us arrest him as planned?
give us the intel and then continue undercover to Gitmo?
either he didn't know, but was close to finding out, or he was onto something big that an NCIS arrest would jeopardize.
well, what's bigger than blowing up one of our ships?
blowing up a port.
ever hear of Port Chicago?
no, but I saw the TV movie.
michael Jai White is this guy who...
I- I see your point.
good. Any intel on the crew, especially this Pinpin Pula guy?
we need his photo for a BOLO.
we took surveillance photos of the crew when they were docked in Istanbul.
great.
if Galib had intel on Abu's plans, did he have time to tell Gibbs?
maybe.
they were together when the bomb went off.
Galib was a good agent.
let's hope Gibbs comes out of this coma in time.
he will.
I ordered another CAT scan on the off chance that he hemorrhaged since the last one.
I think it's unlikely.
so why are you doing it?
covering my ass.
you don't strike me as the ass-covering type, Doctor.
you know, I dislike this "Doctor," "Captain," "Director" formality.
I'm Todd.
see, the truth is, Jenny, I'm puzzled.
Gibbs took a long time to come out of the coma in '91.
you followed his case after he left Kuwait?
uh, not until today.
from Frankfurt, he was air-vaced to Bethesda.
they faxed me his hospitalization records.
he was in a coma for 19 days.
my God! Now that's not terribly unusual, but the tests weren't typical of someone who was in a coma that deep.
I mean, his CAT scan didn't reveal any cerebral damage, his EEG was normal.
it's the same as now.
how do you explain that?
sometimes, patients don't seem to want to wake up.
any reason why Gibbs might be one of them?
the NIS agent driving was hit with a head shot.
wife and daughter... died in the crash.
Whoa! Mom's got one!
not as big as ours. Wow.
it's bigger, Daddy!
the drug dealer your wife saw kill a marine.
I'm in here.
what are you doing?
I'm worrying.
me, too.
Oh, you guys can just set that right there on the floor.
Thanks.
what's the matter...
never heard a girl fart before?
guys, uh, that was the hippo.
uh- huh.
you sure, McGee?
Yeah, because you sound more...
...Feminine.
like a hippo cow?
what aren't you telling me?
what do you mean?
you have that "Three Little Pigs" look.
what?
the three little pigs?
they were afraid to open the door because the big, bad wolf was outside.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
whoa.
this is definitely going on my wall.
I should be a professional photographer.
the director hasn't called.
about?
about?
Oh.
she didn't call you, did she?
no.
because, you know, the way you're acting, you might have just, I don't know, forgotten to tell us.
Ziva, do you notice anything different in here?
no music.
that's it. There's no music.
you know, you usually play music in here.
what if those were Gibbs' guts smooshed all over that room?
Oh, for God sake, Abby, they're not.
I said what if they were?!
the color would be more... coffee brown than red.
DUCKY: His skull was shattered when the explosion blew him against the overhead as if he was fired from a cannon.
the oil drum.
precisely.
now don't ask me what our guest was doing in an oil drum sitting on a bomb.
because I haven't the foggiest.
Mm. No other explanation?
well, none that would explain these remains.
I need a positive ID on this body, Duck.
well, DNA tissue is in Abby's capable hands.
how's Jethro?
still out.
director's with him.
Yeah, I best get down to Portsmouth.
not until you finish the autopsy.
and while you're at it?
why don't you ask your guest what he was doing sitting in an oil drum on a bomb.
you sound like Gibbs.
what were you doing in that oil drum?
hmm?
Oh! Oh!
uh! Uh!
Ah...
Oh, boy!
Tony, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Tony.
hate the sight of blood, Probie?
too bad.
Oh, boy!
handkerchief.
I don't have one.
I'm...
whatever you came to say better be pretty damn important.
Abby slapped Ziva and Ziva slapped her back.
Damn! I missed it?
Yeah.
all right.
assemble the team, including Abby.
Wh... Abby?
right.
which hospital? Portsmouth?
you didn't ask?
Oh, Ziva, I'm not implying that you don't care.
the way you're acting, you might've just, I don't know, forgotten to tell us.
what if those were Gibbs' guts smooshed all over that room?
I don't have an answer.
his EEG is normal, his new CAT scan is normal.
how well do you know Gibbs?
he was my mentor at NCIS.
he taught me most of what I know.
yet you're his boss.
Jethro's a great field agent.
he's a great team leader.
and he deals more efficiently with difficult politicians than I do.
why isn't he the...?
he shoots them.
so you didn't know him when he was wounded in Desert Storm.
no.
he seems to be repeating that trauma.
a coma he doesn't want to wake up from.
in the morning, I'm going to try to find the neurologist who was onhis case in '91.
well, why wait till the morning?
forgive me. Yeah.
I'm... just tired.
I can arrange a cot for you in this room.
no.
I have been away from my office far too long.
I'll find someone who knew Jethro back then.
might be helpful.
here are all my numbers.
and my cell.
well, I'll call you with an update at 09：00.
earlier if he shows any signs of waking up.
it was good to meet you, Jenny.
not under the circumstance, of course, but...
...good, nevertheless.
cover your eyes.
I've seen you and mommy kiss.
well, this is scary kissing.
like kissing a frog? Mm- hmm.
cover them.
Mm...
much as I'd like to,
I can't tell you where the bastard's hiding, Gunny.
I didn't ask you to, Special Agent Franks.
pay up, McGee.
Hey.
you 're gonna bet on me, I collect.
front and center.
you, too, Ziva.
let's go!
I know what happened.
look, she slapped me and I was just...
Hey!
if there's gonna be any bitch-slapping on this team,
I'll do it.
clear?
good.
now shake hands.
shake.
there we go. That wasn't so tough, was it?
now how about a little hug?
big buddy hug, come on.
there we go. Come on.
now a deep tongue kiss.
now we feel better.
all right, what do you got, McGee?
we got Singapore's surveillance photos on the Bakir Kamir crew.
ZIVA: Make me hard copies, McGee.
captain Mahir will identify Pinpin Pula for the BOLO.
what makes you think he won't lie?
um, the taggant traces on the metal fragments were Semtex from the Czech Republic.
Khadafi, before we bombed him, was handing out Semtex like taffy to any terrorist with a sweet tooth.
that eliminates my washing machine malfunction theory.
DNA results?
they should be in by now.
then what are you doing here?
um, somebody called a conference.
you don't think that's Galib in Autopsy?
he wants to be sure.
I've asked Tel Aviv if Captain Mahir is a blimp on their radar. Blip.
DNA confirms.
the body in Autopsy is NCIS Agent Abog Galib.
okay. Any hits on the BOLO?
too many without photos.
Leos are calling in reports on every Filipino sailor in the area.
did you run them down?
Tony, there's 250, 000
filipino sailors- that's more than any nationality in the world.
and the way reports are coming in, you would think that they're...
Hey! I don't want to hear how tough it is, McGee.
I want you to run them down.
stop playing Gibbs.
there!
you're doing it right now!
Ziva, will you help me out here?
it's true, Tony.
you're even getting a little grey around the temples.
you're not Gibbs, Tony.
you're right.
acting like Gibbs doesn't make me the boss.
being senior agent does.
so if drinking coffee, staring or whacking the back of your head helps me lead this team...
...Live with it.
good morning, Agent Gibbs.
the rain stopped.
it's going to be a beautiful day.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you.
I'm Dr. Mallard.
I overheard you talking, and I thought he might be awake.
I always talk to my patients.
me, too.
are you a neurologist, Doctor?
medical Examiner.
Oh.
mine never wake up, but still I talk to them.
well, Jethro,
I'd have been here sooner, only DiNozzo insisted I finish the autopsy on Agent Galib.
it's fascinating.
I mean, the poor man was literally blown out of a barrel.
it reminded me of when my mother and I visited her brother Carkin in the little town of Craigellachie.
Yes, Carkin worked at the cooperage where they make all the casks for the various distilleries.
are you Turkish?
perhaps... your father or grandfather... was Turkish?
before they come to America.
can you see Ziva as a belly dancer?
he brought it up.
why, because he asked if she was Turkish?
from Russia With Love.
bond is ordered to Turkey to steal the lecter machine from this beautiful
I mean, is there any other kind in a James Bond movie?
defecting Russian double agent,
Tatiana Romanova, played by Daniela Bianchi.
Greek.
you are Greek.
Greek.
that's why you hate me.
I'm not Greek.
greek Cypriot?
it would explain you understanding Turkish and hating me.
I doubt Cyprus has a liaison officer in the U. S.
but...
you are getting warm.
liaison?
from the French word "lier," which means "to bind."
in this case, bind to NCIS and Mossad.
I have your dossier.
another French word.
that's it.
Dean Keaton is the name of the character Gabriel Byrne plays in The Usual Suspects.
I knew it'd come to me.
I am not a terrorist.
I did not smuggle weapons into Palestine, I swear it!
or Hamas suicide bombers into the port of Ashdod?
Mossad blames me for that, too?
and much more.
now, look,
I am not a terrorist.
no Wahabi!
I fight no jihad!
you profit from it, you swine!
and for that, you should die!
fortunately for you, Capitan Mahir, politique pratique has suspended.
israeli reprisals against all but terrorists.
and you say you are no terrorist.
I swear by God!
convince me.
Lisa Guiraut plays one of those belly dancing women.
very hot.
she'd be a grandmother by now.
Oh, wait a second, okay.
Ziva looks like her, which is...
Shh.
pay attention, Probie.
Ziva's about to get a photo for the BOLO.
winning the Scotsman Chess Trophy was the highlight of my Lower Sixth year.
I didn't compete in Edinburgh.
no, no, I was too distracted by this week...
impolite of me to eavesdrop, Dr. Mallard, but I was fascinated by your story.
nurse Baliad told me your name and your specialty.
I'm Doctor... Dr. Gelfand.
chief Neurologist.
the Director told me.
Ah.
well, how is our patient?
still comatose, I'm afraid.
were you aware that he was in a coma for 19 days during Desert Storm?
no.
he never told you?
well, Jethro doesn't talk much about the past.
I consider us to be close friends, but I know very little about his life before we met.
you're in a hospital! Relax!
don't fight it, Jethro.
relax, relax. You're all right.
here, come on.
can you blink?
all right, raise your thumb, raise your thumb.
good, good.
do you want the tube out?
all right, all right.
hold still, hold still.
here you are. Just breathe.
you're fine. That's it.
I am Dr. Gelfand.
this is Nurse Baliad.
Maria.
of course, you know Dr. Mallard.
he calls me Ducky.
welcome back, Jethro.
Yeah, we've all been a bit concerned.
you shouldn't frighten us like this.
you have a question?
where am I?
you're in Portsmouth Naval Trauma Center.
you were in an explosion.
man: It got ugly.
didn't think I was going to get out of there.
no, he still hasn't checked in.
I'll let you know as soon as I know.
tell me you have it.
how much time have you had?
dude, it's a keg!
you go to the liquor store, pick it up.
here's the thing about surprise parties, okay?
they're supposed to be a surp...
man: Dude, are you there?
whoa, dude, what was that?
Chris, man, talk to me.
what's up, dude, are you there?
are you okay? I got into an accident.
accident? I'll call you back.
don't worry. I'm fine.
it was a simple question, McGee.
Yeah, one I would expect from Tony, not you.
I'm just being curious.
about when I lost my virginity?
no, you misunderstood.
I'm not asking when you lost your virginity but if... you lost it.
what's wrong with this picture?
you mean, aside from Tony being here before us?
and actually working?
I can hear you, you know?
I am here if you would like to talk.
about what?
I know how much you cared about her.
I'm fine, Ziva. All right, but I thought maybe you needed a little cheering up?
if needed to be cheered up,
I would've put superglue on McGee's keyboard.
you put superglue on my keyboard.
well... you got me. McGEE: Come on.
I was sort of saving it for a rainy day.
did it help?
didn't hurt.
you know...
boss, Tony...
I know.
are you ever going to learn, McGee?
grab your gear-- we got a petty officer in a hit-and-run.
uh...
um...
guys...
little help, please.
Tony: Hit-and-run-- it's a felony now, but in DiNozzo's Guide to Women, a way of life.
in this case, death.
how did he end up over here?
good question, DiNozzo.
Tony: At least he went out looking sharp.
Yeah, but when he dressed this morning,
I doubt he was away?
when people choose not to wear their seat belts, they rarely consider their own mortality.
if they did, they would definitely wear their seat belts.
you know, I would've thought with that kind of damage he would be all the way down there.
did you move my body, Jethro?
someone did.
Tony: Well, the state police said they didn't touch the body after they identified him.
report indicated he blew that stop sign over there.
swerved to avoid another car.
then he went through the windshield when he hit the bridge?
DUCKY: Hello.
Tony: This just keeps getting better.
I'm in with stripper.
this is not an uncommon way for young servicemen to complement their incomes.
in fact, when I was young, I used to...
Oh...
used to what?
DUCKY: Oh, my.
shotgun, close range.
our hit-and-run just became and-scoot.
DUCKY: But there's no visible damage to the head.
I do not believe that this gentleman...
made that hole.
and if he didn't make it, who did?
McGee: The more I think about it, the more I can't believe we fell for it.
Tony with a girlfriend?
I believe he had real feelings for her, McGee.
I don't doubt that-- see what she looks like?
: sounds like you wish you had the assignment.
Yeah, I don't know why the director didn't give it to me to begin with.
still talking about the little probie losing his virginity?
DUCKY: Down here!
there.
this is more like it.
she has a smashed cranium, lacerations and possible multiple fractures.
I think we've found our human cannonball.
Tony: I think the state police definitely had it wrong, boss.
petty Officer Munoz didn't blow off that stop sign.
Nah, he was in the other car.
he got run off the road by the guy who did.
then got shot for his trouble.
ZIVA: No footprints.
her companion took off in Munoz's vehicle and left her here to die.
who does that?
clearly, someone in a terrible rush.
rush to where?
Tony: Well, we know where Petty Officer Munoz was in a rush to. We spoke to his roommate.
Munoz was throwing a surprise party for one of his friends who just arrived from Iraq.
but he was late coming back from...
the Chelsea Girls School Class of '57 50-year reunion.
and I got the pictures to prove it.
Tony: My God.
it's like Cocoon meets Dirty Dancing.
Tony: I wonder if Ducky has dreams like this.
Gibbs probably isn't too far behind.
he's standing right behind me, isn't he?
sorry about that, boss. Going to be your dreams one day, too, DiNozzo.
McGee: Well, maybe Petty Officer Munoz danced with the wrong woman.
and was run off the road by a jealous husband
what, in his motorized wheelchair?
: come on, guys, this is pretty simple.
we're looking for a bad guy who got into an accident, and then he carjacked Munoz 'cause he wanted to get the hell out of Dodge.
put out a BOLO on Munoz's truck.
we got a few more leads to follow, but...
my gut tells me that Munoz had a terminal case of wrong place, wrong time
unless your gut... told you something else, boss.
the girl.
Yeah, we got a hit on the prints.
Heidi Campisano, 25-- though this picture's three years old.
Tony: Pyramid schemes, Internet fraud, bogus rare coins.
she is a con artist. Was.
dropped off the radar three years ago.
I'm guessing since she's laying in our morgue it wasn't to go legit.
the car hers?
no. Car is registered to Nicholas Barnes.
here.
get your ass out here!
: run in the bathroom like a little girl when he saw you guys pull up.
this is about Tiffany, right?
Yeah, his girl.
the name's not Tiffany.
Oh, really.
you don't say.
I told him that girl was no good.
he didn't listen to me.
well, there's some Navy cops here want to ask you a few questions.
now, you remember what I told you about telling lies.
something wrong?
Nope.
Tony: Just had to pee all of a sudden?
figured you want to ask me about Tiff
didn't really want to talk about her.
is that a crime? No.
but murder is.
Oh, murder! Perfect!
you know this guy?
Nope.
he was shot and killed today.
your car was found at the scene wrapped around a bridge.
not my car.
I gave it to Tiff.
she said hers was stolen.
Mr. BARNES: Oh, tell 'em what else you gave her.
a thousand bucks.
tell 'em why.
Oh, for an operation.
what kind? He didn't even ask.
you also didn't ask how she was.
car wrapped around a tree and all.
I hope she's dead.
she is.
if you'd like us to arrest you now, Nicky, that can be arranged.
Mr. BARNES: Hey, now, wait a second.
just hold on right there.
my boy ain't guilty of anything except for being an idiot.
now, that girl Tiffany, or whoever she was, she was playing him and a couple of other guys.
he spoke up to her about it and she run off-- that was about a week ago.
she said she loved me.
you don't lie to somebody you love.
do you know how wonderful it is to be with someone who doesn't even lie about the little things?
how can I ever trust you again?
: Why? Why? Why?
sorry, boss.
I ain't seen her since she left.
anybody seen you this morning?
Oh, he was here with me, all day.
I got about a half a dozen customers who can vouch for that.
names.
sure.
like I said, my boy's an idiot, but he ain't a killer.
now, a girl like that, playing with people's hearts, you track down some of them jilted lovers.
I guarantee you'll find out who done her in.
: I can't wait to make?
DUCKY: The demise of someone as young as you is always a tragedy, but someone...
: in your chosen profession, it's to be expected.
Yeah, for example, did you know that the infamous confidence man, Victor Lustig, sold the Eiffel Tower, almost twice, but then he convinced Al Capone to buy $50, 000 of bogus shares.
what do we have here?
you're late.
we have an appointment, Duck?
no, we have a crisis.
I apologize for not seeing it sooner.
you know how I feel about apologies.
Yes, well, you may want to make an exception in this case.
I now know why the driver of the Chevy didn't bother to check on his companion.
she was dead...
before she was put in the car.
all her vehicular injuries are postmortem.
how?
extensive blunt force trauma.
she had a subdermal hematoma that would almost certainly have proved fatal.
poor girl was beaten to death.
Thanks, Duck.
well, I knew all that an hour ago.
what I just learned was that she had been pregnant.
she gave birth?
Yeah.
right before she was murdered.
Hey, Abs, hope you don't mind, but I need to use one of your computers.
hard to concentrate while Tony's calling Heidi's former victims.
he's become very sensitive to the word "liar" these days.
thought you quit.
McGee, there is a baby missing that might need medical attention.
I need to be at the top of my game.
well, you're going to spend most of your game in the bathroom.
I already thought of that.
I'm upping my salt intake to increase my body's water retentions. nt
of course you are.
so what do you have for Gibbs?
nothing.
why, is he on his way down here?
no, he's here.
and he's talking about himself in the third person.
I like it.
Ducky said you had something.
don't you want to see what McGee has first?
I came down to see you.
Abby was able to recover amniotic fluid from the dead woman's clothing.
you got the baby's DNA.
Abby's running it now.
you can't use it to find the father, but when you have a suspect,
Abby can test it and see if he is the father.
Abby already ruled him out?
good work, Abby.
McGee is going through Heidi's records now.
problem is, because she had so many fake identities?
Plus, most of the activity is over three years old.
but luckily, a snooper program I was running did find one, two, three, four sizable deposits made to her account recently from a man named...
maybe that's another boyfriend she conned.
we'll let you know when we get back.
Abby has to pee.
no, I'm sorry, I don't recognize the name.
well, she's got a lot of them, Mr. Nelson.
maybe.
I travel a lot.
travel where? Trade shows.
my husband's a computer programmer.
well, I work in domotics.
it's home automation.
the application of...
automated techniques for the comfort and security of the home resident.
I can control the entire house.
lights...
media...
fireplace...
even turn on the lawn sprinklers if someone isn't supposed to be here.
who is she?
who was she. She's dead, murdered.
and her newborn is missing.
why are you telling us this?
we've traced several recent deposits made to her account from your husband.
from me?
well, there's...
there's got to be some mistake.
you said that she uses a lot of names, right?
maybe she's stolen my identity.
like I said, I travel a lot.
it wouldn't be hard to do.
I can settle this.
feel free to look around.
but if my husband says he doesn't know her, he doesn't know her. Right?
that's right, honey.
at isn't supposed to happen.
I'm going to have to reset the breaker.
excuse me. Here, I'll give you some help.
reset switch is just in here.
how long you been seeing Heidi?
I told you, I don't know anything... No, you told your wife.
and I let you.
but now I get the truth.
just a few months.
till I found out she was stealing money from me.
she was forging my signature on my checks.
we barely saw each other and we n
baby's not yours.
no, it's not.
I need your DNA to verify that.
forget it. I'm not going on record that I was ever involved with that woman.
you need DNA, you're going to have to talk to my lawyer.
maybe I'll just talk to your wife.
is your evidence that flimsy that you have to resort to threats?
I had nothing to do with Heidi's murder, okay?
but if you got something that says I did, you should ?
fair enough?
Oh, yeah.
adrian: Everything's fine, honey.
they're going to show themselves out.
Mrs. NELSON: Everything's not fine. Got it?
there are policemen in our house asking about a dead girl.
McGee: Fingernails clippings, toothbrush swabs and Q-tips.
this is a check to Heidi Campisano from Adrian Nelson's account.
this is a known sample of his handwriting.
the signature's real.
four checks.
$10, 000 total.
Heidi didn't steal anything.
Adrian sent her the money himself.
did more than that, McGee.
tried to hide it from us.
DNA? Abby's still working on it.
Tony: Come on, that's not what I'm saying.
boss, since we got a pretty strong lead here, can Tony stop calling Heidi's other marks looking for suspects?
listen, I am simply saying just because she was lying to you, doesn't mean that she didn't really love you.
Hello?
what?
let him call a few more.
we have two theories to explain the dishonesty.
theory number one:
Heidi Campisano seduced Adrian Nelson.
then blackmailed him threatening to tell his wife.
she had done it before, plus, it would explain the payments.
and the fact she is now dead.
theory two: Adrian found out that Heidi was pregnant with his baby.
also explain the payments.
and the fact she is now dead.
with those options, I would've lied, too.
DUCKY: But no doubt, more effectively. but thinking more objective?
I took the liberty of going out and getting this for when you find our missing newborn.
any word? Yeah, I checked all the hospitals in the area and beyond.
no babies on any doorsteps.
but you weren't expecting any, were you?
killer's got the baby, Ducky.
only way we're going to find that kid is to find the killer.
Tony: Okay, I'm on my way.
you got something, DiNozzo?
Yeah, dentist appointment.
no...
this is for real, guys.
I... remember I chipped my tooth and I-I got the, uh...
I'd sent you an e-mail for a leave request, like, two days ago...
about this.
you don't check your e-mail.
never mind.
very Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo,
boy Who Cried Wolf And Who Must Now Suffer
periodontal Disease For It. How may I help you?
ABBY: I've got something. Get down here.
okay. It's Abby. She's got something.
Hi, Gibbs.
Abby, I think you might need to lay off the caffeine again.
maybe I need a little more,
McGee, you ever think of that?
baby missing.
you said you had something. I do.
that's what I'm so excited about.
actually, everything's really exciting to me today.
um, I was able to get the N 's DNA off the toothbrushes th McGee swabbed.
I compared the husband's DNA to the fetal DNA from the missing child.
Adrian Nelson? Definitely the father.
there's no shocker there. Well, I'm not done.
definitely not the mother.
she gave birth to a child who is not hers?
it's called gestational surrogacy, where the sperm and the egg come from third parties and then the surrogate acts as a host.
ABS, did you check...?
Sara Nelson's DNA?
Sara Nelson is definitely the mother.
McGee: That's what the payments were for.
the Nelsons hired Heidi Campisano as their surrogate.
perhaps she changed her mind about giving up the baby.
that's not the question.
did the Nelsons kill her for it?
clear.
clear.
clear.
looks like they left in a hurry.
place is a mess.
not all of it.
I do not understand what the Nelsons' plan was.
to have a baby.
that part I understand.
that is why they hired Heidi Campisano as a surrogate.
but if she refused to turn over the baby,
I'm sure the Nelsons would've had other options besides killing her.
I mean, after all, they were the biological parents.
I'm not a lawyer.
but you were a parent.
you want to have children, Ziva?
well...
it's a simple question.
I do not have a simple answer.
once you have kids, you'll understand.
if the Nelsons were really willing to do anything for their child, they would be getting it medical attention.
Yeah, well, maybe they are.
safe was cleaned out.
Plus, I found the box to an infant car seat in the garage.
they're going somewhere with the kid.
you go for a swim, DiNozzo?
Oh, yeah.
sprinklers went off when I was digging through the trash outside. Nice timing.
actually, it's part of their security system.
forgot to warn you about that.
uh, boss, found something on their computer.
Tony: Thanks for the heads up, probie.
I owe you one.
I love you.
now you need to figure out if you feel the same way.
Tony: I don't want to hurt you.
I can't live a lie.
Tony, I...
Adrian Nelson is covering his tracks.
he erased his entire hard drive.
GIBBS: So we can't see what he's been doing.
I thought you said you found something.
Yeah, the root directory's still intact.
there's no personal data, but I did find an API he had written to interface his home automation system to his car's onboard navigation computer.
hmm.
pretend you're talking to someone who actually has sex with other humans.
all I have to do is hack the API, and I can use it to get the GPS coordinates on his car. Yeah, do it, do it.
Tony: This is great-- it means
I can stop calling Heidi's marks.
I mean, of course,
I will look for those other guys, but...
sorry. Sorry.
McGee: They haven't moved in the last 20 minutes.
Tony: Might have dumped the car.
Gibbs and the state police will know soon enough.
what are you still typing?
I'm refreshing the tracker.
forget it, I don't want to know.
it's good to have a geek on the team, but I prefer good old-fashioned police work.
McGee: Well, it's not an old-fashioned world, Tony.
tell that to Gibbs.
sex? Losing your virginity? It's good.
pretending to be someone else.
I don't know, Elf Lord.
you were really in love with her, weren't you?
don't you have some more typing to do or something?
Yeah, he does. Car wasn't there.
what? What...
I double-checked the...
all right, I think I know what happened here.
uh... 20 bucks says McGee's about to say something nobody understands again.
the GPS coordinates came bundled in a proprietary packet.
since it was a beta... I'm starting to think you can't help yourself, McGee.
the code must have alerted
Adrian Nelson that I was tracking him.
he reprogrammed his car to send us back false coordinates.
can you deprogram it, McGee?
I can try.
Oh ? police work oh look ? what's that
who are you calling?
Hey. DiNozzo. DONNY: Hey, man.
Yeah, man, what's going on?
listen, I got an update on a BOLO. Missing kis.
give it to me. Dead Head sticker.
left rear window. Nice.
: Yeah.
I know, man-- that was good times.
listen, I got another call, I really got to go.
hang tough, Donny.
old-fashion police work deserves an old-fashion reward.
Mmm...
interrogation got a little out of hand.
I had to...
I can't explain that.
hello.
again.
hm.
you know, I saw this on, uh, Cinemax once.
so, what happens now? They play some funky music, and then you say,: "I have been watching you from afar.
well, I've been watching you from afar, Tony, which is why I know how much you cared for Jeanne.
Oh, your timing is impeccable, Ziva.
and how much it hurt when she left.
so, what happens now?
I said I'm fine.
you are not fine.
you are still deeply troubled.
even if I was, this bothers you because...?
because you are my partner.
and because you made a grave error in judgment falling in love with that girl.
if this is a pep talk, I give you a D-minus.
and right now, it is very clear you are still hanging on to her.
I see the confusion.
these are called feelings, Ziva.
feelings you need to let go.
that easy, huh?
Tony... even if by some miracle Jeanne did forgive you, would you be willing to be
Tony DiNardo full-time, to leave your entire life behind for her?
you did not think this through.
didn't you tell me the heart wants what it wants. No.
actually, I didn't.
well, it does.
well, it shouldn't.
really.
this coming from the woman who fell in love with the dead man walking.
you crossed the line, Tony.
Oh, I crossed the line?
don't ask.
wasn't going to.
bolo just came in-- they found the car.
Oh. Hmm, jelly donut, one; Inspector Gadget, zero.
not the BOLO on the Nelsons' car.
the BOLO on the dead petty officer's.
nothing here.
the truck's been wiped clean.
and someone's stolen our petty officer's blood stain.
it was also cleaned.
or we're wrong about where Munoz was shot.
witnesses.
McGee: Uh, no witnesses.
local LEOS found the truck abandoned near a forest preserve.
well, it couldn't have been there long.
ZIVA: How would you know that?
you know everything about everybody.
Tony: Sap, Ziva, there'd be more sap on the roof. Except for the fact it rained last night. Do I need to send you two back to the men's room? Hey, she followed me in there!
only because you wouldn't talk to me.
shutting up, boss.
ready?
ZIVA: So much for being wrong about where
petty Officer Munoz was shot.
Tony: We got footprints.
Yeah, question is, whose? Petty Officer Munoz was a size 13.
those look like a size 13 to you?
GIBBS: Send them up to Abby.
ABBY: The prints were made by a residue of polysaccharide dust derived from beta-glucose.
what makes it interesting is the backbone of D-xylopyranose, linked with eight xylose units.
panda poop.
Panda...
poop. Which is why it fluoresces, like all other poop does.
what makes it really, really, interesting...
is the sodium hypochlorite.
aka Chlorine bleach.
I lost you at poop, huh? Uh-huh.
paper, Gibbs.
a while ago, a group of Chinese researchers decided to try to recycle panda poop into high-quality paper-- they contracted several U. S. paper mills to develop the research.
killer must ever gone to one after he shot Munoz.
the dust from the mill would've been impossible to avoid.
there's one within a hundred miles.
closed down six months ago.
: I love my job!
actually, animal dung's used for a variety of things:
paper, fuel, mud bricks.
it's very useful.
ZIVA: Not for them, it wasn't.
this place is abandoned.
not quiet, Ziva.
here, let me get that. Honey, let me get it.
Tony: In position, boss.
federal agents!
Tony: NCIS! Hands in the air!
No! Agent Gibbs, please, you have to leave!
Oh, my God, you'll ruin everything!
adrian: Oh, no, no!
you've got to stop him. My baby!
they've got my baby!
adrian: It's okay. Honey.
: Oh, God.
Tony: At least probie has an idea for his next book.
baby kidnapped; cops screw up ransom drop.
let me know ASAP if the situation changes.
ZIVA: The Nelsons hid the kidnapping from us,
agent DiNozzo -the mistake was theirs.
well, you should point that out to Gibbs, Officer David.
I'll be in the next zip code. GIBBS:
McGee: Agents are still out canvassing.
no one saw the Honda, much less who was driving.
keep looking. DiNozzo.
taps on the Nelsons' phones; I'm on it, boss, right now.
a-and I still have a... a few more of Heidi's marks that I have to track down.
that-that's next. That's right after...
I'm on it. Ziva.
coordinate with state police, see if we can widen the search.
Tony: Uh, hi, this is Special Agent...
boss, you think the kidnappers will call to arrange another ransom?
what's the option, McGee?
I'll see about getting more agents on the canvass.
we already have the entire department, McGee.
all I know is, we got a call saying that Heidi was dead, and that if we ever want to see our baby, we needed to come up with $50, 000.
which we did until you ruined it.
how much longer do we have to sit here? That depends.
on what?
don't you have something you could be doing?
my wife had a partial hysterectomy four years ago.
?? to Southeast Asia and back.
my exact opposite.
she had a womb but no eggs.
she was a life-saver-- it was almost...
too good to be true?
then it usually is.
we already knew her background, Agent Gibbs.
you still think she was trying to con us?
GIBBS: You paid her.
paid surrogacy's illegal in Virginia.
that why you didn't go to the police?
Hey, look, I got all day.
your kid is missing.
we didn't go to the police because we knew they'd screw things up.
and you've still got it wrong.
Heidi was our friend.
we were happy to pay.
and she needed the money.
then she decided she wanted more.
this may have been her, but not anymore.
she was trying ??
I have no idea!
I don't know who has my child!
if anything happens to my child, you're the one who better run for cover.
McGee: No satellite coverage of the paper mill.
nothing on the traffic cams.
all right, send it over.
careful over there.
wouldn't want to break a finger.
Gibbs does not accept apologies, but I do.
I'm sorry, Ziva.
I know you were trying to help.
did I?
I'll get back to you after I shame McGee.
did you find something?
I've been compiling a list of Heidi's former marks.
ZIVA: We've noticed.
any one of them could have a score to settle.
the problem is they all have solid alibis for the day that Heidi was killed, except this guy.
filed a complaint over a pyramid scheme Heidi was running.
where does he say he was?
uh, well, he doesn't.
I haven't found him yet.
does not exactly look like a score settler to me.
mm, no. How about now?
a buddy at Baltimore PD just sent this over.
turns out this guy also filed a complaint against Heidi.
it is the same person.
it's called a shill.
they're part of the con, but they pose as a customer to try to convince the other marks to jump in.
if the con goes bad, they'll often file a complaint so it builds credibility with the other marks.
then they can move in for a secondary con.
I used to date this guy once...
he was Heidi's partner.
Yeah, might still be.
high five for the traditional police work.
uh, Tony, he's dead.
killed a year ago by one of his marks.
you might want to brush up on ??
GIBBS: Hey!
do you know where my killer is?!
Gibbs, I don't know where the killer is, but I know what he was planning on doing with Heidi's body.
ABBY: Since the Chevy didn't leave any skid marks at the site of the accident, the first thing I did was check the brakes.
the line were intact and the fluids were topped off.
GIBBS: The pads were bad.
they needed to be replaced.
I know, Gibbs, but here's the thing.
and this is so good, I can hardly take it.
the brakes were replaced about two weeks ago.
I found metallic shavings in the brake drum
it only could have come from new pads and shoes.
GIBBS: Brakes were replaced and then the old ones were put back on?
Yes, the accident was not an accident.
well, actually, it was, it just happened too soon.
it was the perfect cover-up.
the killer probably planned on putting Heidi's body behind the wheel of the car and sending it over a cliff.
it would have covered up the murder.
and it would have been blamed on worn brakes
the only problem is the killer cut it too close.
the brakes went out.
so who would rely on the mechanical failure of a break pad compressed against a disc rotor to hide a body?
Hey!
Uh-oh. What did my loser son do now?
he killed Heidi Campisano.
then tried to ransom her baby back to the biological parents.
my boy ain't that clever.
guess that's why he needed your help.
look, I told you he was here with me all day.
Yeah, and your customers confirmed that.
but nobody we spoke to saw you.
a witness did see you in this Honda near the Stern Paper Mill this afternoon.
ZIVA: Seems you two are more than just father-and- son mechanics.
nice shotgun.
shoot any naval petty officers lately?
Where's the baby?
I don't know what you're talking about.
so I was at a paper mill.
what's that, some kind of a crime?
baby!
the baby's with Nicky.
and Nicky?
I told him to wait here for me to call, but my moron son never does what he's told!
BOLO-- on it, boss.
that girl of his was never going to give up that baby.
I was doing those parents a favor!
you're under arrest for the murder of Heidi Campisano.
Oh, come on! That was an accident!
petty Officer Munoz, that an accident, too?
ZIVA: Because his murder is also in our warrant.
look, when my brakes gave out...
you mean when you rigged them to go out.
we know that you replaced Heidi's brake with a set that were about to fail and make it look like she died in a crash.
that little son of a bitch!
I'm going to kill him!
after all I've done for that little bastard!
he didn't know the brakes were rigged to fail?
no, he didn't.
cancel that BOLO, DiNozzo.
you got my pa?
Yeah.
he killed Heidi, made me lie to you about her.
I know.
she didn't cheat on me.
she wasn't bad no more.
we were even going to start a family together.
except Heidi couldn't have no kids of her own.
she was smart, though.
figured out a way to get one.
guess that part was bad.
wish I could tell you it wasn't.
I would have raised my own boy right.
when the baby was born, we were planning to run away, but my pa wanted the rest of the money we were going to get.
Heidi and him fought, then she had the baby...
my pa took it, she was screaming.
and you didn't do a thing.
I did.
it was just too late to matter.
the brakes.
am I in trouble?
prosecution's going to call it attempted murder.
your lawyer's going to call it self-defense.
what do you call it?
family.
Hey, boss.
is everything okay?
it's the sprinkler again.
parents are waiting outside.
you think I'm crazy?
no.
ZIVA: Here's your baby.
Oh, my God!
thank you.
it's a boy.
McGee: Hey.
here you go, Tony.
look at him.
don't do this to me, boss.
come on, don't do this to me.
don't make me kiss you, boss.
come on, boss! Come on!
Oh, boss, come on.
no.
please, please, please, please, please, Gibbs. - No.
okay, I'll never ask you for anything again, ever. - Abby...
I promise. - Come on, ever?
well, okay, maybe not ever, but I won't ask for anything else for at least like...
a week.
sure. Where and when?
here and now.
boss...
there is a young women here waiting to see you.
I sent her to the lounge.
name? - Maddie Tyler?
about? - Twenty-two, 23.
sorry. Uh, personal.
she wouldn't say.
it's for my cell phone, so when Gibbs calls, his face will appear, and I'll know it's him. See?
nice... print.
Oh, hi.
special Agent Gibbs.
I know.
I - I mean, I remember.
but you... probably don't.
I'm Maddie. Maddie Tyler.
it's been a long time.
I used to come over to your house.
I was Kelly's best friend.
or, I mean, at least I remember myself being her best friend.
I like to think she thought so, too.
you lived on base?
my dad was an officer.
I remember.
a good man.
he retired.
moved back to Oakland.
died a couple years ago.
I'm finishing my degree at Georgetown. Science.
I guess you're wondering... why I'm here.
this is going to sound so stupid.
I can't believe, I'm...
I need some help, and you're the only person I know who...
problems?
guy problems.
crazy guy problems.
I went on a couple dates with him, about 18 months ago.
he's a Marine.
went to Iraq.
just got back a week ago.
he came to see me, you know, wanted to get things started again.
but I mean, there was...there was nothing to start because nothing had ever gotten started.
I tried to explain that, but, um, he kept insisting.
he was desperate to move in with me, and, uh, when I said no, it wasn't what he wanted to hear.
he stalking you?
did you report him to the police?
they said there's nothing they can do.
it's only been a week.
he threaten you?
he hurt you?
I don't think he meant to.
he just kind of grabbed me, but...
he's really freaking me out.
what's this Marine's name?
where would I find him?
outside my house.
cute!
pretty!
that's the best yet. - Boss!
Oh, I didn't know you were...
sorry, Gibbs.
agent Gibbs, we need to talk about the latest East African threat assessments.
when you've got a moment.
know her?
wish I could say I did.
who is?
ask McGee.
said it was personal.
new girlfriend?
too young.
not a redhead.
niece? - Nice.
Mcgeek, McGoogle her name.
Oh, I can do you one better-- MySpace.
well, she has an eclectic taste in music
everything from Yo-Yo Ma to Metallica.
lots of friends, college kids mainly.
and one from her childhood.
my first and still my best friend, Kelly.
forever in my memory.
Gibbs' daughter was named Kelly.
one and the same.
mystery solved.
that's his car.
Hey, Madds, I was just looking for you, babe. Look.
hey...
who are you?
this your old man?
she does not want to see you.
it means you're not going to come back.
you're not going to call her.
you're not going to drive down her street.
do I need to say it again? - No.
it's around here somewhe.
do you want some more coffee?
Nope. Fine.
as soon as I graduate, I am moving back to Oakland.
this place is such a pig sty.
there's this really great animal hospital there.
they offered me a job in the lab.
it's just a general practice.
eventually, I,uh, plan to specialize in horses.
Kelly and I were both crazy about horses.
Oh, here it is.
can't remember who took that photo.
I did.
I never did find out what was so funny.
she never told you?
sorry.
I shipped out to Iraq that month.
they followed me all the way to Pendleton.
last time I saw them.
it was a time capsule.
we, uh, filled this toy suitcase with all of our...
treasures, Kelly's mostly, and buried it in your backyard.
we were sitting on it.
I never stopped crying.
still think about her, after all these years.
wonder what she'd be like.
like you.
here, you should, uh...
you should have this. - No.
no, that's your memory.
our memory.
I should be going. Thanks for the coffee.
that bad, huh?
I really can't thank you enough.
you got my number. He comes back...
call me.
and you keep this locked.
I just...
I - I gotta go.
marine Sergeant Rudim Haas.
works in logistics, currently on a 30-day leave after returning from Iraq eight days ago.
service record?
clean.
eight years in.
prior to that, grew up in Chicago.
state and local police. See if he's got a record.
why do we need to know?
are we opening an investigation into Sergeant Haas?
background check.
on what grounds? - Stalking.
the young woman that was in this afternoon?
did she file a complaint? - No.
is this personal, Jethro?
if you're asking do I know her, the answer is yes.
is it personal? No.
do it.
she knew.
reads Gibbs like a book.
short read, not a lot of dialogue.
your kind of book.
you suggesting I don't read?
I think she's suggesting you only look at the pictures, Tony.
a picture paints a thousand words, McGee.
and in your case, most are the names of female body parts.
I'll have you know that since 1981, I've been a loyal subscriber to National Geographic magazine.
that's some serious picture-gazing right there.
so how did she know?
woman's intuition.
do you have that?
forget I asked that question.
the Director could see Gibbs was preoccupied with something, and she saw him with the girl.
sounds more like male logic than woman's intuition.
either way, I think she's worried about him.
question is, should we be?
don't go, Daddy. Please, please, please don't go.
Yeah. Gibbs.
Jethro, he's back!
No! - Get in the car!
No! Let go of me!
get in the car! - No!
shut up and get in! - No! Somebody help!
help me!
bolo's out on Haas's car.
his photograph and details are on their way to Metro Police.
need her photo, too.
Abby's got one.
from when she was trying to take yours... earlier.
Ziva, you want to call Abby.
Haas's current address.
assigned to Quantico as an enlisted trainer, but he hasn't reported in there since he got back from Iraq.
got to be staying somewhere.
no known relatives in the DC area.
friends then.
I want the address of every place he's ever lived.
uh, I'm working on it, boss.
her cell phone?
switched off. - His?
also switched off; I'm trying to access his recent calls now.
And?
and I've... well, I've only just started.
you were going to brief me, weren't you?
she called me.
I got there, place was trashed.
saw her being pushed into Haas's SUV.
you identified him?
I identified his car.
so you didn't actually see Sergeant Haas abducting her?
maybe it was someone else?
well, it must have been Haas driving.
could have been driving.
best guess.
what else do we know about him?
haas turned down Uncle Sam's offer to reenlist last month.
in 60 days, he'll be a former Marine.
last deployment?
logistics, worked out of the Green Zone in Baghdad.
everything Marine going to or coming from Iraq channeled through his department.
desk jockey.
got his phone records.
moderate usage.
recurring numbers?
there's a few.
15 calls in the last eight days to a landline in the name of Maddie Tyler.
others?
five incoming from a company here in DC.
it's the first call he received when he got back from Iraq, and the last call he got before he switched off his phone.
Bordais Security Solutions.
BSS, a small sized security firm.
with a contract in Iraq, Marine today, mercenary tomorrow.
filthy rich the day after.
looks like Haas was being head hunted.
I need a name, McGee.
ceo is a retired Army Major, Max Bordais.
ours is a small company, Agent Gibbs.
less than 100 employees, the majority of whom were in Iraq.
doing what?
protection details for various VIPs.
haas doesn't seem like the highly trained soldier your company would hire.
he's a paper pusher.
and from what I've been told, no one pushes paper better.
signed him up?
made him a generous offer.
And?
he passed.
he say why? - No.
evidently a thousand dollars a day wasn't enough.
a lot of money for a clerk.
I guess he didn't need the money.
look, I did my homework.
haas is considered one of the best logistics people in Iraq.
you want it, he'll find it.
you can't get it through channels, you get it through Haas.
that's what they say about him.
a guy like that is worth a dozen of my highly trained soldiers.
where is he?
I don't know.
you're lying.
I only have his cell phone number.
am I under arrest?
no.
where is he?
agent Gibbs...
I only talked to him on the phone.
he didn't want to meet me.
he made it clear he wasn't looking for a job.
now, if you're not going to arrest me, I'm walking out of here.
nicely handled, Jethro.
you're right.
he's holding something back.
then again, he's not the only one, is he?
you said you knew her.
family friend.
when?
long time ago.
how long?
five years, ten years? - Fifteen.
are we done here?
Gibbs, I e-mailed Madd's photo to state and local police.
um, I printed you one, too.
of course, I cropped you out of the one that I e-mailed.
I just thought that maybe you would want a copy of the original.
she was Kelly's friend, wasn't she?
we're going to find her, Gibbs.
I know it.
boss, you might want to see this.
McGee got something.
I plotted all the cell phone calls Haas received or made in the last eight days.
most were made from his car as he was driving.
the signal passed from tower to tower, which doesn't help us, but three of the calls were made from the same location, using the same tower each time.
now given the range and signal strgth, they could only have been made from this four-block radius.
a lot of real estate, McGee.
until you add what I found.
only job Haas ever had in DC was in the six months before he joined the Marines.
he worked as a night watchman at a clothing factory, lived on-site.
the factory closed three years ago.
puts him right in the zone.
hear that?
flies.
guess we found Haas.
not quite a stairway to heaven.
perhaps an elevator to a less compelling place.
this is he, I take it?
Yup. Rudi Haas.
Yes, well, when we're confronted with crucifixion, we immediately think of the Romans, but it was used as a form of execution long before them by the Egyptians and the Greeks, and after them, by the Persians, and then, of course, the Japanese.
Hey, Duck, I don't got a whole lot of time on this one.
Yes, I understand, Jethro.
obviously at first blush, the uninitiated would pounce upon the theory that he was involved in some sort of macabre or perhaps demonic ritual, but we are not so quick to draw such an easy conclusion, are we, Timothy?
numerous cuts and nicks on his torso and face.
significant bruising of the left arm.
coloration indicates that this bruise predates these more recent wounds.
Yeah, someone gripped him, vicelike, and squeezed.
uh, yeah, that would have been me, Duck.
I'll go see how the others are doing.
no, Jethro, I think in this case, there is a totally mundane, though no-less-sickening reason that he was nailed to the floor.
they didn't want him to struggle while they tortured him.
time of death?
well, now, that is another problem.
well, not for me, but for you.
rigor is fully set.
he's as stiff as the boards to which he is nailed, indicating a time of death at least 12 hours ago.
I'm afraid Sergeant Haas was already long dead when Maddie Tyler was abducted.
guy comes back from Iraq, starts stalking a girl he barely knows, trashes her apartment, and then abducts her?
didn't abduct her.
didn't abduct her?
already dead.
tortured first.
he gave them Maddie's address.
they trashed her apartment.
apparently, they did not find what they were looking for.
so they abducted her.
whoever they are.
she must know something.
or have something they want.
it's a GPS locator, boss.
real time, wired into the radio.
I think our stalker was being staloe
you're always welcome down here, Jethro, but I've barely started.
I'll take whatever you got.
well...
nothing confirmed at this point.
no fatal wounds.
and there was very little blood loss at the scene.
so we can rule out stabbing, bludgeoning and gunshots.
no signs of strangulation.
there does appear to be some petechial hemorrhaging, which suggests asphyxia. Someone could have smothered him with a pillow or clamped a hand over his nose and mouth...
Jethro, she was abducted more than six hours ago.
your point?
well, there's a strong possibility that...
look, If I have to explain it, perhaps you are too close to this.
what else?
swelling of his face.
and then there are these lumps and bumps.
could be hives.
allergic reaction?
wait a minute.
it could be anaphylactic shock.
Yes, the most severe form of anaphylaxis occurs when an allergic response triggers the release of large quantities of immunological mediators.
this leads to systemic vasodilation.
Yes, my suspicions were correct.
his air passages are all closed up.
Oh, probably dead within minutes.
allergic to what?
seafood.
and he wouldn't have to have eaten any of it.
merely coming into contact with it would have caused his demise.
Jethro, just who are you trying to save?
I look at her, I see Kelly, Duck.
how it should have been.
Jethro, be careful.
don't-don't let your...
some things just can't be undone...
I wasn't there then.
I am now.
I don't want to see you, Gibbs, 'cause I don't have anything yet.
I'm working on it as fast as I can, and you know how fast that is
nobody's faster than me.
I am the master of faster, normally, but there's nothing normal about this.
do you have my things?
Yes, his clothes and the nails.
we're going to find her, Gibbs.
we're going to find her. You believe that, right?
don't answer that.
forget I asked. Just...
okay.
I need all of you to get out of my lab. Let me do my thing.
I have all these samples to test and Major Mass Spec is going to blow up in protest if I don't blow up first.
sorry.
this isn't my lab.
I'm going to go.
a high-end item like a GPS locator
I figured the manufacturer would keep a record of who it was sold to.
cross-checked the serial number against their records.
look who I found.
makes Maxie Bordais a big fat liar.
and a suspect.
bring him in.
soldier of fortune is about to become a soldier of misfortune.
dogs of war are about to taste the hair of the dogs.
think she's alive?
after what they did to Haas, maybe it'd be best if she was not.
showtime.
this your subtle way of sending me a message, Director?
nothing subtle about it, Mr. Bordais.
you are now officially a suspect in this murder investigation.
want to explain that?
GPS locator.
real-time tracking of target vehicles.
bought by your company.
found in Sergeant Haas's car.
operational.
wait for it.
wait for it.
I need to make a phone call.
some of these guys are so predictable. First sign of pressure, and they cave.
see that coming a mile way.
a lawyer is not going to help you now.
I'm not calling a lawyer.
calling the Pentagon.
like I said, hair of the dogs.
I was assigned as a special investigator with SIGIR.
I take it you've heard of us?
special Inspector General for Iraqi Recon{truction.
as I'm sure you're aware,
SIGIR was established to audit funds allocated to the rebuilding of Iraq.
unfortunately, substantial amounts of that money are unaccounted for.
I heard $8 billion in cash.
$100 notes.
plane loads of them.
no one denies mistakes were made, Director.
we're doing the best we can to recover the money to return it back to the Iraqi people.
what's that got to do with Haas?
two of my employees were suspected of stealing $4 million from a vault in Baghdad three years ago.
names?
Danny Coyle, Brian Judd. Both ex-Army.
let go of me!
get in the car! Shut up and get in! - Somebody help!
somebody help!
while we suspected them, we never found the money.
until two weeos ago.
it had never left Iraq.
couldn't move it.
finally, they approached Sergeant Haas.
he found a way to smuggle the money out of the country.
but it appears he got greedy.
no honor among thieves.
sergeant Haas is the only one who knows how the money's being shipped.
his tour was up.
he didn't have a lot of time to organize it. We think just a few days.
you were tracking him via GPS? - Yes.
and Coyle and Judd?
until they switched cars 24 hours ago.
we know the money has arrived.
we just have no idea how or where Haas is planning to collect it.
you know where they are? - No.
said you were tracking them.
Weretracking them.
as I said, we lost them.
compromised?
we don't believe so.
they're very good at what they do.
taking counter measures, changing cars, only turning on cell phones to check messages.
they abducted a girl this morning.
we know.
you know?
our, uh, surveillance wqs breaking down, and we were waiting for more manpower.
you saw it happen.
we couldn't have stopped it, Agent Gibbs, and I resent the suggestion that we placed this operation ahead of the life of that young woman.
where did you lose them?
I don't have to share that information with you.
where?
agent Gibbs.
in her apartment, in the street?
the next block? The next suburb?
where exactly did you lose them, Colonel? - Enough, Agent Gibbs!
I think we're done here. - The hell we are!
NCIS is conducting an investigation into the murder of a United States Marine, and I can assure you, I will bring down the full weight of this service if you do not give me your utmost cooperation.
do I make myself understood?
Yes, ma'am.
now...
where exactly did you lose them, Colonel?
Hey, DiNozzo. - Boss.
Abby gets something, you handle it.
no problem, call you right away.
that what I said, DiNozzo?
I'll handle it.
they think Coyle and Judd might be somewhere down in the old dock district.
tell DiNozzo.
Tony... - Director?
any idea where he's going? - No.
hazard a guess?
well, he took his badge and his gun.
maybe he's gonna shoot someone.
Oh, boy.
you want your money, call me back.
this is ground control to Major McTom.
this is ground control to Major Tom.
is anybody out there?
what?
I'm just checking.
you've been staring into space for the last hour.
even on the McGeeko scale that's cause for concern.
it's been five minutes, not an hour, and I'm not staring into space, I'm staring at the plasma.
calling Gibbs?
he did not pick up.
worried about him?
are you?
you be worried about him.
I'll be tentatively troubled.
privately perturbed.
fleetingly flustered.
have you called him?
I would have to be deeply discombobulated to even think of calling him.
okay, McTim, you win. What are we looking at?
what do you see?
it's an iceberg, and we're headed right for it.
more like the $4 million tip of an $8 billion iceberg.
forget the $4 million, I'd settle for finding Maddie.
I've been trying to figure out where she fits.
she doesn't.
for her to have been abducted, they must think she has the money.
or can lead them to the money.
if she can, she doesn't know.
she would have told Gibbs.
maybe she doesn't know she knows.
sergeant Haas comes back from Iraq and the first thing he does is try to move in with a girl he's dated twice.
Why? - He's a man.
what does she have that he does not?
a bed. - A room.
a place for Haas to stay.
he had a room at Quantico.
so, what does her apartment have that Quantico doesn't?
privacy.
no guardhouse.
no car searches.
a street address.
her apartment has a street address.
which means mail delivery.
how long does it take a letter to get here from Iraq?
a week.
give or take a day or two.
he's from Chicago.
no family here.
no delivery address.
he wasn't stalking her.
he was hanging out to check the mail.
get down to her apartment.
find the mailman.
he figured it out.
and he didn't tell us.
you call him?
you? - Yeah. He didn't pick up.
don't go, Daddy. Please, please, please don't go.
I still think about her, after all these years.
wonder what she'd be like.
like you.
excuse me.
got a registered letter for Rudi Haas.
I need to see some ID.
mm, don't want to know.
there he is.
excuse me! - Yeah?
NCIS. We're trying to locate a letter addressed to Sergeant Rudi Haas.
just delivered it. - Okay. Thank you.
how long? - Five minutes.
he signed for a letter.
it appears Haas shipped the money out of Iraq as the personal effects of a dead Marine.
Gibbs must have the receipt.
gone to collect them.
find him, Ziva.
he beat us to it.
Abby-- she's caught a fish.
atlantic bluefin tuna.
these pallet nails were sticky with it.
the fish oil gets caught in the spiral shank of the nails, it dries, it gets gucky.
the more oil, the more gucky.
so they're just layer after layer after layer of... of guck.
when they whacked these into his hands, they were like poison darts.
how common is bluefin tuna?
I checked with the fishing authorities.
there's very few places that handle it in DC.
most are at the Maine Avenue Fish Market.
that's too crowded.
that leaves us with...
southwestern Marine.
it's down by the old dock.
uh, there was an exporting company there.
it closed down a couple years ago.
exporting what? - Guck.
I'll get McGee and Ziva to meet you there.
Abby? - Has anybody heard from Gibbs?
no.
I called him and he didn't pick up. He always picks up.
good work, Abby.
all right.
yeah? - You got it?
I got"it.
all right, then bring it to us. - Where?
southwestern Marine, main storage building.
and make sureit's just you.
on my way.
you okay?
I'm so sorry.
you her father?
it make a difference if I am?
not to me.
arms up.
spread 'em.
he's clean.
haas said there were two bags.
other one is in the trunk of my car.
Yeah, it's good.
you get the keys, I get Maddie.
Where's the car?
downtown parking lot.
I caught a cab.
then you better find another cab and go get it.
get it yourself.
run!
in the car! Car!
it's okay, Daddy.
it's okay.
go back, Daddy.
go back. It's okay.
I love you, Daddy.
love you.
I love you, Daddy.
dude! That's the mailman.
mail woman. All woman.
are you going to shoot something or just keep staring?
come on, dude. Hurry up!
hold up. I'm coming!
you seeing this? - My shot.
okay.
come on.
there's the windup... and the pitch...
and there it is! A shot up the middle!
Singleterry puts one in the gap to left center field!
one run's gonna score! Two runs are gonna score!
Singleterry flies in head-firs.And he is safe!
I was proud to call special agent Decker my friend.
even after his retirement, I knew that he was never more than a phone call away.
my heart goes out to his family and his beloved girlfriend Sasha.
I know that William loved her very much.
I'm sure he did. - We're at funeral, and she's 22.
Yeah. - Is that why we're here?
so you can google the girls? - "Ogle.
and no, we're here to accompany the director.
I, for one, am glad she's back from vacation.
decker died of a heart attack, not in the line of duty.
I hardly think her presence is necessary.
Tony: Ncis code of conduct, paragraph one, sub-section B.
any interstate travel made by the NCIS director, must be accompanied by...
you're ming this up. - Yes. But...
she always is accompanied by two senior agents for security purposes.
and if it's not a rule, it really should be.
sorry. What was that name again?
Mr. Oshimaida.
first name?
there are more than one?
no, sir, in fact, there's nobody here by the name.
check again.
sorry, sir. I've checked the registry twice. There is no Mr. Oshimaida.
but if you'd like to leave your name, perhaps, I can...
director, are you ready to go?
no, actually, I'm not.
no rush. You know, uh, we'll just hang out.
no need to wait for me.
in fact, we are not due to fly out until tomorrow.
so why don't the two of you...
Yes, sure.
take the rest of the trip off.
right, sure. So, you want us to call you a taxi, or...
you want the car. Of course.
cause, we'll- we'll figure something out.
Thanks. All right, drive safe.
that L. A.traffic's a little weird.
l. A. Baby! Sorry, Ziva. I'm going to have to cut you loose.
wait up!
good morning.
haircut, Mcgee? - No.
I believe it was a suggestion, not an observation.
is there something going on downstairs?
is something wrong, Mcgee?
Yeah, what are you guys... - doing upstairs?
random bug sweep.
off-limits to all non-security personnel.
didn't Jethro tell you?
or perhaps his cranium trauma is acting...
he's behind me, isn't he?
good morning, Jethro! - Doc.
got something for me?
just arrived from major Fornell.
mysterious. - Yeah.
Yes. Well, the security boys should be finished by now.
thanks for the hospitality... probie.
currently, it's 78 degrees in Hollywood, 82 degrees in the valley and 73 at the beach.
all in all, a great looking couple of days in L. A.Warm days, cool nights, and very low humidity...
take it the Ritz was booked.
ice.
better be a damn good reason you had meump on the earliest flight out of Mexico.
you ever work with special agent Willam Decker?
he hired on the year I retired.
Why?
he in some kind of trouble?
he's dead.
and I'm next.
I need your help.
my help?
you are the director of an armed federal agency.
this has to be outside the agency, and I need someone I can trust, and you're on the short list.
I didn't know you were a fan.
Gibbs' short list.
he trusts you with his life and that's good enough for .
let's hear it.
ten years ago, I spent time in europe with another agent.
I take it you two weren't sightseeing we were...
but the sights we were looking for weren't on any tourist map.
classified.
nice chatting with you.
enjoy the free cable.
we were trying to infiltrate a Russian spy ring.
special agent decker was our contact agent.
he got us our identities, handled communications...
I know the drill.
the name Oshimaida was a code word we were to use in the event our cover was coromised.
and was it?
we thought we got out clean.
but today at Decker's funeral, a man asked for Mr. Oshimaida.
coincidence.
only three of us knew that name.
whoever he was, he heard that name from Decker.
and Decker only would have used it if he thought he was about to be killed.
you said he died of a heart attack.
the coroner said he died of a heart attack.
decker is trying to get me a message.
you're next?
my partner's in danger too.
whoever he is, he believes one of us is Oshimaida.
who's the other agent?
the next time I head for that door, it won't be for show.
where do I sign up?
ABBY: Five shots of the back of his head, none of his face, and one of the woman driver.
she's a great director; Annie Leibovitz she's not.
any ideas?
no, I know.
but I can't ask Mcgee because the director specifically said to keep this on the seal.
keep what on the seal? - Nothing.
you told them.
McGee... they're not real.
they're just keeping me company while Tony and Ziva are in L. A.
okay. Guess you don't need my help.
uh, wait.
I do need your help.
but you have to keep it a secret.
my lips are sealed.
okay.
the director sent me these pictures.
she needs an ID on the John Doe.
does Gibbs know about this?
I asked her; she said no.
she didn't say any more. I didn't push.
did you try blowing up the photos? Okay, how about, uh...
the reflections on the side of the car?
that's a great idea, Mcgee.
I had it like two hours ago.
did you have any luck with the driver?
a woman. Could be blonde, brunette. I don't know.
the ex-if data, on the cell phone.
it should tell us the exact time the director took the picture.
McGee, tell me something that cardboard Tony doesn't know.
no, Abby, look.
he's making a call.
if we know what time the call was placed, wean ping all the cell towers in the area...
and we can lift his cell phone number.
that's genius, Mcgee.
you're googling. Again.
a book. How Mcgee-ish of you.
you're in my sun.
you'll thank me later. Come on. Let's go.
if you value at hand, I suggest you back away slowly.
I'm not going anywhere.
the director gave us the day off.
Yes, and she can just as easily change her mind.
we need to stay close to home base, just in case.
we have cell phones, Ziva.
if she needs to get in touch with us, she'll call us.
what do you have in mind?
a cruise down Sunset boulevard against all odds, Jeff Bridges, Jimmy Woods.
you do not have a car, Tony.
zero to 60 in 5. 2 seconds.
first movie quote I hear, I'm driving.
pay the guy.
thank you. - Thank you.
Gibbs teach you that?
Gibbs doesn't teach. You watch, you learn.
you learn. I taught.
we're talking a risk coming here.
local polices may have missed something.
I doubt Decker's killer left behind a call card.
if he was here, he left something behind.
or Decker did.
he was a profession.
Yeah. Got little careless in his retirement.
Sasha, we're not going to hurt you.
how do you know my name?
you were at the funeral.
that's right. I was an old friend of William's.
we're here to help. - Help with what?
Sasha... we don't think William's death was... natural.
and I'm guessing you don't either.
if there's something you need to tell me...
william never said anything specific.
just that if anything was to ever happen to him, that I was to deliver a message.
to who?
Jenny Shepard, director, NCIS.
you know her? - Unfortunately.
we'll deliver the message.
william want me to tell her that he had some sort of...
insurance policy. I think he called it.
where?
in his place out in the Desert.
an old diner.
he was going to start fing it up next month.
he said Jenny would know where to look.
this the address? - Yeah.
Sasha. Do you have family?
not in L. A.In Nevada. - Good.
go there. Now.
I-I don't have a car.
take my rental.
you should do what the lady says - okay.
forget your name?
it's better she doesn't know.
better for who?
so when we find who did this.
it'll be just the way you like it.
no paperwork.
you wanted the authentic L. A.Experience.
I'm giving it to you.
I wanted to read my book.
they have books in Washington.
they have traffic as well.
I do not like this. Mething feels off.
Yeah, it's the tranission.
no, it's about the director.
Tony, we are her escorts.
we're supposed to be escorting.
maybe she found a new escort.
the director is a flesh-and-blood woman with flesh-and-blood needs.
if you want to call and ruin her private party, be my guest.
Shephard: You couldn't have gotten a car with Satnavy?
sat what?
never mind.
Yes, agent Dinozzo?
um, hi, director. How's everything going? How's the paperwork slow. Too many interruptions.
well, it's a beautiful day to be stuck inside.
you need something, agent Dinozzo?
no, just hecking in with our fearless leader.
Franks: Got it.
Shephard: What'd I tell you, Tony?
not to call you our fearless leader. - And?
to take the day off.
enjoy your time in L. A. , because, believe me, I can always find something for you to do.
paperwork had a deep voice.
she is with a man.
does not mean she is sleeping with him.
you're right. I'm sure there tag-teaming the paperwork.
she's hiding something from us.
Yes, it's called a sex life.
maybe if you had one, you'd be a little more understanding.
Oh, I could tell you stories.
tell. Slowly.
all righ but first, you have to do me one small...favor name it.
call the Los Angeles police department, tell them you are conducting a local investigation, and ask them to track down the GPS coordinates of the director's rental.
that's all?
it will make me very happy to know where she is.
it'll be like Chinatown.
I will even let you do your Jack.
well, hodo you like them apples?
ABBY: Mcgee, what are you doing?
pinging all the cell towers nearby Hollywood forever cemetery, scanning for the director's mystery man.
no, what are you doing to my Tony?
I'm improving him.
actually... I do like a man with a little scruff.
got a hit.
ten calls were in progress when the director snapped that photo.
ABBY: Triangulating with the nearest cell tower for locations.
Hollywood forever cemetery is here.
running his background.
nothing in the domestic database. Checking international.
got him.
McGee, are you seeing this?
what exactly did the director say this was for again?
she didn't.
it's the director.
good luck with that.
no, you wanted in, Mcgee. You're in.
just... just quiet.
forensics spialist extraordinaire, Abby Sciuto.
how can I help you?
got a name?
Hey, director, how's... - name, Abby.
Viggo. Drantyev. Viggo as in Mortensen.
and Drantyev as in... Drantyev.
background?
um, he flew in from moscow ree days ago, solo.
rented a car, checked in to the excelsior hotel, and then he checked out early this morning.
that's not background.
that's all I have.
Viggo Drantyev didn't exist until three days ago.
he doesn't anymore.
burn alias.
Yeah, damn good one.
totally untraceable, which is impressive these days.
whoever this guy is, he must have friends in high places.
like, nosebleed.
anything else? - Nope.
you want Mcgee to put out a bolo?
no. Erase e search.
what search?
so, Drantyev hits town, and before sundown, your boy Decker is dead.
not enough for a conviction.
enough for me.
who is he?
you don't know.
I know who sent him.
and I know who he's after.
one, two, three. Breathe, damn it! Breathe!
I don't recall shouting being one of the instructions, Mr. Palmer.
sorry, doctor, I guess I got a little carried away.
Hello, Jethro.
new girlfriend?
no, CPR recertifications.
work has been sufficiently slow lately for me to be able to update them.
Oh, uh, when can I put your name on the list not today.
uh, give us a minute please, Mr. Palmer. - Yes.
Annie can stay.
I know that look, Jethro.
I'm afraid I'm all out of secrets.
you read the autopsy report on the Grenouille murder.
Yes, what about it?
anything bug you?
normally, I am very bugged when a person is shot at point-blank range in the head.
but in this case, despite the man's charm, I'm willng to make an exception.
that a "no"?
well, pathologically, there was nothing out of the ordinary.
a single bullet entered Rene's frontal lobe, causing castrophic cerebral hemorrhaging that resulted in almost instantaneous death.
Yeah. Yeah, I read that.
then you know as much as I do.
I had the impression this case was closed.
it is.
then why all the digging?
what are you hoping to find?
answers, Duck.
there's a reason why sleeping dogs are left to lie, Jethro.
California.
there it is, the director's rental.
well, what can I tell you, kid?
when you're right, you're right.
Ziva: The car seems fine.
Yes, it does.
now, can we get the hell out of here?
no, that's a good idea.
we should stay here, wa for the director to catch us snooping.
what is she doing here?
you mean, who is she doing?
you heard that guy on the phone.
she's probably at his hotel.
now you're making some sense.
where to, miss? Rodeo drive? Nice beach?
our hotel or I file kidnapping charges.
this is not good.
let me handle this, ok?
Hey, you can't come up in here. - NCIS. What's going on?
fatality. Looks like she fell.
mething not much of a people person.
I noticed.
not that I don't like 'em. They never seem to like me.
decker didn't have that problem.
then why's he dead?
better save that for the guy that killed Decker.
you might need it.
first we have to find him.
if he knows about Decker's insurance policy he'll find us.
there's no obvious signs of foul play.
Depes on what you mean by obivious.
she is dead.
you said she just buried her boyfriend.
well, she obviously, you know, been hitting the bottle.
she could have fallen.
or jumped. - Or was pushed.
you know something I don't? - No. She-she's just...
it's, you give us a second. Excuse me.
what are you doing?
leave the director out of this.
the director's car is right there.
Yeah, there are 50 cars right there.
well, I'm not providing security detail for those 50 others.
Sasha's been dead for two hours.
we talked to the director 20 minutes ago.
she said everything was fine.
probably just a coincidence.
you don't really believe that, do you?
no.
this is not what it looks like, Gibbs.
so, I guess it's exactly what it looks like. Ducky wanted us...
I know. - Right.
so... what brings the almighty Gibbs to my humble lab?
the frog.
sorry I asked. I thought that case was closed.
shell casings contain variety of useful data points.
the first one...
is this indentation caused by the firing pin.
its position narrows down the list of possible firearms.
can you tie it to a specific gun?
Yep, in 2010.
that's when the manufacturers will be required by law to microstamp a serial number onto the firing pin.
today, Abs.
well, it depends on who you ask.
I'm asking you.
okay, the second data point is this.
it's breechblock patter around the back of the shell casing.
it comes from thconcussive force of the gun firing.
it won't let you say definitively if a particular gun was used, but it can rule a gun out.
this is interesting.
that scratch, it could be an ejector impression from when the spent case was ejected ort could have come from a slight defect in the gun clip.
I couldn't really say for sure without inspecting the clip, but, either way, I doubt it's defitive enough to be admissible in court.
I know.
I have a bad feeling, too.
you didn't you stop me?
thought you knew where this insurance policy was.
I never said I knew.
decker said I did.
and stop looking at my ass.
not much else to look at.
of course, it might help if you were to tell me what I was looking for.
deer knew that someone was after him.
and he knew why.
your mystery operation.
any useful insurance policy would contain names.
real names. Targets. Dates.
plus operational blueprints, photos.
we got plenty of those.
these dates are wrong.
do you have a pen?
this is decker's retirement party in 2007.
crime analysts conference, 2002.
september 18, 2004.
Hopkins-Delahoya.
this is some kind of code.
bank routing number?
too long for a cash account.
safe deposit box.
Ziva. Again.
you don't answer it, they're gonna call in the swat team.
this better be world war III officer David.
Sasha Gordon is dead.
what happened?
LAPD's still investigating.
it appears that she broke her neck in a fall.
director, she was found less than a hundred meters from your vehicle. Where are you?
when? - Three hours ago.
Ziva: Director, we are assigned to protect you.
this is not just a coincidence.
where are you?
I don't apppreciate your tone, officer David.
and despite what special agent Dibbs may have told you, coincidences do exist.
and that is what we have here.
okay, but... - I'm fine.
thers nothing to worry about.
I'll meet you later to take the red-eye flight home.
good news?
not for Sasha.
that went well.
the director's lying. She's not fine.
why would she lie?
maybe she was forced.
did she use the duress word? - No.
well, there you go.
if someone had a gun to her head, she would use the duress word.
Tony, there is something going on here.
how can you not...
youdo see it.
you just don't want to get involved.
she doesn't want us involved.
if there's one thing I've learned about the director's private wars, it's that it's best to stay away.
for her and for us.
she's a big girl. She can take care of herself.
besides, probably is a coincidence, anyway.
and she's behind one of those expensive windows munching on overpriced cashews courtesy of Mr. Outtatown.
I told Sasha to leave town.
probably went back to her apartment to grab a few things.
if viggo got to her, we have to assume she talked.
knows about us.
and this place.
and Decker's insurae policy.
guess he's gonna be on his way.
if we leave now...
you can go.
I'm staying. This end here.
you're gonna need a clean one.
we should call him.
but we're not going to.
he would want us to. - Would he?
of course. They were partners.
if the director was in trouble, he would... - we do not know that she is in trouble.
okay, I'll give you that one.
but...
you want to be the one to tell Gibbs that we let the director out of our sight?
good point.
but it's a risk we have to take.
or we compromise.
agent Mcgee.
what took you so long? Were you sitting at my desk?
no. - You're lying.
Tony, what do you want?
Ziva: Your advice.
you lost the director, didn't you?
no. - Now, you're lying.
you were sitting at my desk.
we did not lose the director. We just...
we just don't know where she is.
Gibbs is gonna kill you guys.
all right, calm down, Mcgee.
don't get your panties in a twist.
we just talked to her. She said she's fine.
she just said she needed... a little alone time.
I'm just worried she might be under duress.
did she use the duress word?
no.
then she probably is fine.
thank you. The great Mcoz has spoken.
I need you to trace her cell.
wait, you want me to trace the director's cell? Forget it.
Gibbs is not gonna like that.
I thought you said you weren't gonna call him.
we won't.
if you trace her cell.
do it, Mcgee.
if we figure out she's at the farmer's daughter motel with some guy, then we'll just call it a day.
all right.
pulling up the director's electic number. Pinging all towers in the L. A area.
no hits.
expand the scope.
still no hits. Must have her phone turned off.
I can, however, tell you where she made her last call from.
just off the 14, about 35 miles into the Mojave desert.
50 miles away from her car.
you got an exact location?
I'll work on it. - Let us know.
this is not a good idea. - Humor me.
you always clean your gun before a fight?
it's not my gun.
you always sit your ass before one?
what should I be doing?
assessing our situation.
you read that in the manual?
Deadbolt: Schlage. Same lock as the front.
Wood-frame, stucco exterior, lath-and-plaster walls.
stone in the rear.
if they don't come too heavy, should provide adequate cover.
situation assessed.
I never said thanks.
thank me later.
when I first heard that Decker died of a heart attack, was relieved.
Gibbs did say you were complicated.
relieved because I always knew that there was a chance this could come back to haunt us.
and it's my fault.
I made some choices I'm not particularly proud of.
we all have.
even Gibbs?
he let you go.
no. He didn't.
he didn't fit into my five-point plan.
back to choices.
you made your bed.
what if I don't want to sleep in ?
Gibbs know?
would it make a difference?
he came back, didn't he?
came back for the job.
well, that would explain all the conversations we had on my boat.
you know, about job.
U're still young.
you got plenty of time make right.
we could have made it.
the needles below "E." "E" stands for empty.
we have less than empty.
and we don't even know where it is.
we could have made it.
what? - What?
try to make yourself useful. - What?
I said, why don't you make yourself useful?
what do you want me to do? Hold your nozzle?
get us a map.
some white powdered donuts.
and some blue ice gatorade.
you better have my coordinates.
even better. I got an address.
did me checking. Turns out Decker has a little diner in the desert, - and I can place Jenny's call to within... - what's the address?
just sent it to your PDA.
you deserve a probie snack.
get yourself one, but not from my desk drawer. Use the vending machine.
might be hard to believe, but I was involved once.
her name was Maggie. She had it all.
quick as a fox, great curves.
trusted her with my life.
what happened?
traded her for a harley when the transmission blew.
you know, when I asked you if Gibbs knew,
I wasn't talking about your feelings for him.
I was asking if he knew you were sick.
gonna lie to me now?
what makes you think I'm sick?
person gets a look in their eye when time's nning out.
you're not that good.
found your pills.
you went through my purse?
your purse and your cell phone and your glove box.
just being thoroug you blame me?
Gibbs doesn't know.
what are you waiting?
good question.
what?
turn at the giant cactus, right?
that's what he said.
found some tea.
what kind?
does it matter?
only drink lemongrass.
you just don't strike me a tea-drinking kind of guy.
and people say I don't open up.
well, no water, so, so much for the tea.
I spotted a water tank out back. - I'll go.
uh, let me. I've got to hithe head again anyway.
you're up.
the weapon wasoaded, and I wasn't here, would you have pulled the trigger?
thought you might want this back.
there it is.
Ziva: Look. I have seen that SUV before.
gas station.
you still believe the director's on one of your booty calls?
well, if there's a sock on the doorknob, you're knocking.
you're in.
clear.
Jenny? Jenny, you there?
wait there.
I'll come to you.
said to wait.
and I said not to.
this is my crime scene.
you called SECNAV; he called me.
I'm sorry, Jethro.
bodies were picked up last night.
they're going to Washington.
he'll be handling the autopsies.
first two shooters came through the front door; the other two came from over there.
she stood here.
she got off the first shots.
shooter number one never even fired his weapon.
she took heavy fire after that.
one in the shoulder, one in the arm.
she started moving this way, the other two entered through e side door.
second shooter went down there.
she dropped to her knee.
she fired three more times.
which leaves the fourth shooter.
we know how that ended.
she put up a hell of a fight.
not good enough.
she was outnumbered, five to one.
I think you got to check your math.
we found four . 45 caliber shell casings and no .
there was a second car here.
it was the director's ride.
the fifth gunman must've taken it.
no blood?
nothing but a tire track.
we'll put out a bolo as soon as we can ID the car.
I'm sure you want to get this bastard as bad as I do.
Yeah.
bodies are on their way to Washington.D.C.
I chartered a private transport, should be arriving shortly.
what do you got?
I'm sorry, Gibbs.
we are sorry. - What do you got?
not a lot.
tire tracks are from a second vehicle.
Vance: Yes, agent Gibbs has arrived, and I've briefed...
we're working on it.
we should've tailed her. Ziva...
Ziva wanted to tail her. - Yeah.
Yes. Why didn't you?
we were given an order.
Uh-huh, and you followed it.
and now Jenny's dead.
Vance: We keep a lid on this.
no press conference, no public statements. Understood?
it's a coveup. Understood.
I'm heading back to Washington.D.C with the bodies.
agent Ibbs, you will remain here and oversee my investigation.
I'll expect a call when youre finished.
DiNozzo... - yeah, boss.
oversee his investigation.
and then call me.
you're late.
the least of my problems.
well, I got another one for you.
Vance knows there was someone else at the diner.
my tire tracks?
I'm not the only one with a problem.
Jenny died protecting someone.
who? - You.
call him again.
I've already left Tony five messages.
call Ziva.
why'd you call Ziva more than you called Tony?
right, not important. At is important is that we remain calm.
I am calm.
well, don't you care about your friends?
you just said... never mind.
we haven't heard anything from Tony and Ziva, and then Dibbs gets on an airplane without a word.
something is wrong! I can feel it.
Abby, if something bad happened, I'm sure we would've...
heard by now.
what is it? - E-mail from Tony.
photos... tire prints.
Tony wants me to find out what car it came from A. S.A. P.
that's it?
are they working a case?
am I interrupting something?
just Abby's nervous breakdown.
Oh, I sure everyone is fine.
do you have any reasons to believe otherwise?
they're working on a case.
common courtesy is the first casuality in a Jethro war.
who is it?
it's for me.
I know I typically dominate the conversation, but you called me...
Jenny's dead.
yesterday.
Oh, dear.
I... I... can't believe that it happened so...
she was murdered. Firefight.
Tony and Ziva?
no involved.
what can I do?
five bodies... on their way.
I assume one of them is... - yeah.
tell Mcgee, tell Abby I'm gonna need them.
Yeah. I know, Duck.
who?
everything.
she called me two days ago.
said she needed some help from someone outside the agency.
another one of her options.
one of yours.
europe.
well, I spent a lot of time in Europe, Mike.
What'd I tell you about leaving them loose ends?
not to. We didn't.
well, you screwed the pooch somewhere.
Decker's cover was blown. They found him.
made it look like a heart attack.
they"?
Decker's funeral...
there was a guy named Viggo came looking for a man.
relax, probie.
classified went out the window two days ago.
I know Oshimaida was the code you used if your cover was compromised.
in paris, nine years ago.
Yeah. Decker resurrected it.
when they found him, instead of giving you up, he sent you a warning.
bought you guys some time.
not enough.
she known what she was getting into.
her last stand was to protect you.
who protected her? Mike?
what happened?
I was out back.
I saw them going in the side door.
too late.
I did what I could.
Yeah. You always do.
if you're looking for an apology...
I know better.
I'm sorry, gunny.
Abby, I'm almost done here. Where's that next batch?
coming.
it's okay.
Abby, it's okay.
no, it's not.
we have work to do.
Abby, slow down.
I can't.
let me.
how could this happen?
I don't know.
where were Tony and Ziva?
and don't ask me what I do know, because I don't know that, either.
I need more time.
how long does it take to track a tire print, Mcgee?
we're going as fast as we can.
Tony, what happened?
not the time, Mcgee-- I need that ID now.
got it. It's a p-235, all-season radial.
it's a custom mold.
all grand marquis rented the last 48 hours.
got it. Calling you back.
do it now, or have Abby do it.
she seems to be having better luck.
all right, we're opening a port into western rental servers.
I'm checking all the customer records for the last 48 hours.
ten grand marquis at the lax office.
three rented this week. Only one in the past two days.
it hasn't been returned.
Joe hill out of New Mexico.
no listing at the DMV. Must have used a fake ID.
that's our guy. Get it! I want that photo.
well, it's not on the server, but I-I should be able to find it on the...
what?
it is not Mcgee's fault.
no. It's not.
we left paris clean.
Yeah.
Jenny told me.
and I might have bought , except there were three agents on that operation.
two are dead.
the operation?
how many?
one each.
you verify the kill?
her kill.
jen was a profession.
I noticed.
what about Decker?
I hear he had a thing for the ladies.
what is your point?
maybe he was compromised.
we got out clean.
Jenny knew something you didn't, probie.
and so did Decker.
he knew this might not be over.
left an insurance policy.
the numbers were...
GIBBS: Coded in photos.
the way we did it back then.
we burned the original.
that's the only copy.
I'll let you know.
you need me on this one, probie.
Viggo was just a hired gun.
there's someone else outhere.
it's not your fight, Mike.
Vance looking for you.
so go back to Mexico.
give my god daughter a hug for me.
Yeah. Got it.
great. Send the photo. Thanks.
boss.
Hey, you got a pen?
boss, I'm-I'm, sorry... - you got a pen?
I got a keyboard.
what is it?
I don't know.
but I'm going to find out. - Yup.
when are you back?
on my way.
what about Tony and...
boss, we got a problem here.
just one?
the ID on the tire tracks from Decker's diner came in.
car was rented to... - Mike Franks.
Yeah. How did you... - Erase it.
makes me miss cCalifornia already.
assistant director Vance.
didn't now that you were... - just got in.
late night?
still logging crime scene photos, yeah.
anything on the shooters? - Yeah.
three of them had a list of prior felonies in the L.A.
$5, 000 cash on them.
local hires.
the fourth shooter used a burn-alias to fly from Moscow into Washington, finally into L.A.
bolo?
there wasn't one.
have Washington International Airport pull every piece of security footage on Mr. Drantyev.
the gate, customs, baggage claim.
on it, boss.
any lead on the fifth shooter?
uh, nothing yet.
all right, give it another hour.
then go home, get some rest.
okay.
doctor.
I've never had to, uh, autopsy a colleague.
I assure you, Mr. Palmer, the next one won't be any easier.
you, my dear, were a woman who always knew what she wanted.
a trait which some may have seen as mere careerism, rather than the true sense of duty I know carried you.
Mr. Palmer.
Oh, I am sorry. I... I must have...
she was dying, Jethro.
she knew e deterioration would have been rapid.
as difficult as it is to say, this may have been more merciful.
look, I spoke with you earlier.
you were supposed to send me four security tapes. You only sent me three.
thank you.
I hate airport security.
rough flight?
I saw you two went swimming.
what are you saying, Mcgee?
no, I was...
saying saw that picture of Ziva at the pool. And...
say it.
say what?
I screwed up. You can say it, probie.
it was not your fault. - Thank you.
GIBBS: Abby's lab. - Sure, be right down, boss.
Abby's lab.
I've barely had a chance to finish unpacking this stuff, Gibb let alone processing it.
I don't have anything for you.
you will.
I will. And it'll be my best work.
always is, Abby.
it's different this time.
this time it's for the director.
this'll be my very best work.
I tried not to sad.
it's okay.
she was always such a snappy dresser, you know? Like classy.
I never told her that.
why didn't I tell her that?
she would have liked that. She would have smiled.
I mean, you can't wait with stuff like that, 'cause you never know what's going to happen.
I like the way you dress, Gibbs.
it's masculine and spruce.
always with a jacket.
see, even you smiled.
and tony... you're business but after-hours. It's nice.
Ziva, you kick ass, and you look so good doing it.
Oh, Mcgee.
boss, I... - it's not your fault.
only one thing to be concerned about.
finding the director's killer.
should I call Vance?
unanimous no.
was this a hit?
Tony: Well, it was personal, has to be.
why else would she have brought along Franks?
she intended to try to end something.
does that mean the "something" is still happening?
don't ask.
why wasn't I invited to the party?
then I guess you were on your way up to brief me on the only guy that walked out of that diner alive.
we'll take the stairs.
tire tracks led to a car rental company at LAX..
mercury marquis rented to a Joe Hill.
we're still waiting on the ID.
San Diego team working on this?
nobody knows anything about Jenny.
and don't worry, I'm sure your people would eventually have put together the missing pieces.
or have you already?
you think you can protect them forever, Gibbs, you're mistaken.
there's already been one casualty.
there will be more.
we got something, boss.
rest of the airport footage from TSA.
why are you whispering, Mcgee?
you know, I didn't, I didn't want...
to yell.
didn't want to yell. You were across the room the and... right.
the, uh, footage you requested just came in.
let's see it.
now, the first three clips show Viggo Drantyev walking through the terminal, passing baggage claim.
professionals usually travel light.
McGee: Then exits.
and the last piece they just sent in is from outside.
that is Viggo coming through the door right there.
cab number and plate, Mcgee?
on it. - Good.
wait.
professionals do not share cabs.
Viggo wasn't traveling alone.
run it back.
McGee: You know what? Let me pull up the photos from the funeral.
that could be the same woman.
either of you recognize her?
no. - No.
agent Gibbs, you...
McGee, get him back here. Now.
where is he?
who, Gibbs?
I am sorry, but I do not have the slightest clue where...
photo pops up, Gibbs runs off the reservaon, and nobody knows a damn thing.
sounds like a wednesday.
and her?
your director's dead.
the director you were asgned to protect is dead. We'll get to that.
but right now, I need to know what Gibbs knows.
decker left a code behind, some kind of insurance policy.
it's a string of 13 numbers. Don't know what they mean yet.
find out. - I will.
and when I do, you'll be the first.
name. Go.
Hey, guys.
McGee sent you an e-mail.
no, I didn' get any...
ABBY: Download this affachment.
neat.
who is she?
we wouldn't be down here if we knew, would we?
facial recognition?
start with interpolice. Eastern Europe.
what country? - All of them.
well, that... - just do it!
Tony... - Abby, Abby. Please.
all right, come on, baby.
come on!
have you tried latitude and longitude?
leads to a field in Chile.
it's too many digs for a pin number.
it's too few for a bank account.
encrypted code, then?
I've tried letter substitution.
I've tried frequency analysis. Affine shift ciphers.
affine shift ciphers?
it's kind of hard to explain. No offense.
you mean it's hard to explain why you'd waste time on an affine shift without even knowing the multiplicative inverse?
well, I thought.
have you tried a transposition ciphers? - Not yet.
Vigenre encryption? - Well, I was going to.
so you haven't done anything?
you call me when you have.
surprised it took you so long.
thank god for Ducky.
you have not listened to anything I have said.
well, it's only been three years; I'm a slow learner.
and a slow healer.
you're crying over spilled... milk.
it's not milk that I spilled.
do not do this, Tony.
don't do what? Blow my protection detail? Blow my undercover assignment?
those sound like apologies.
she died alone.
we are all alone.
Yeah. Thanks for that.
I just mean that she never got married. Never had any children.
never even heard her talk about it.
Paris.
that's when it must have happened the two of them alone in another world.
putting their lives in each others' hands every day.
not to mention the long nights.
it was inevitable.
nothing is inevitable.
I got it! - Got what?
I think I figured out the code.
he was a navy warrant officer.
he was busted in 85 for selling encryption ciphers to the Russians.
I know that.
but since I hit a dead end, I thought I'd look into his NIS case file for inspiration.
and that is when I saw it.
ciphers that Walker used are over 20 years old.
not the ciphers I saw, it was his.
us NAVAL INVESTIGATIVE SERVICE CASE NUMBER
the code that Decker used was not a code.
it's an old nis case file number.
Yeah, I didn't make the connection, because in the NIS days, we used shorter file numbers.
so Decker hid his insurance policy in plain sight: One of his old files.
pull it up. - I can't.
nothing prior to 84 in t system; it's in storage.
Annex. Across the street.
Vance: You two, with me.
nice work, agent Mcgee.
McGee! Nice work.
here you go.
knock yourself out.
who was the last person to look in this?
uh, it'll be on the log, uh...
it was last signed out in 2001.
wasn't the question.
an old friend asked me to do a favor.
that favor involve you leaving to take a leak?
Yeah.
when?
about an hour ago.
name.
Hey, it was just look, okay?
let me guess.
special agent Gibbs?
no. Mike Franks.
go take a leak.
sure thing.
did you know Mike Franks was involved in this?
Yes. - No.
you need to take a moment and get your stories straight?
no. - Yes.
that explains how director Shepard got out to the dinner.
Franks was the fifth shooter.
on Jenny's side.
whose side are you on?
well, you finally got your stories straight.
so where's Anks?
maybe... on his way to Mexico.
Why?
honor.
he fulfills his debt to director Shepard.
he disappears with the file. It ends.
bolo, stop him at the border.
yeah? - Found her.
we're on the way.
McGee: Her name is Natasha Leov, citizen of Uzbekistan.
came out of nowhere in 1999.
built up a very successful import-export business.
and before 99?
didn't exist. - No earlier records.
completely blank. - Not a thing.
whoever our mystery woman was back then, she is now Natasha Lenkov.
Gibbs saw the photo, recognized her, and he's gone to find her.
tying up a loose end maybe.
but how would he know how to find her?
maybe he's going to call her.
maybe Gibbs has an old number.
no, he's not going to call her; he doesn't have to.
she's going to call him.
Viggo's cell phone. - Here.
Photogphed, tagged, logged and... and missing.
yeah?
Vance: Think of a reason why I shouldn't personally throw the book at you for hinding a federal inquiry?
because you want this to go away.
where the hell are you?
not far.
Franks with you?
should he be?
if he's not, thehe's on his way to Mexico with Decker's insurance policy.
don't smile.
Natasha Lenkov, real name?
Svetlana Chernitskaya.
And?
I'm going to have to put you on hold.
the hell you damn.
what are you hearing?
russian Polka.
hello
who is this?
does it matter?
I've got what you want.
Where's Viggo?
dead.
I need you to come see me.
who is this?
Mr. Oshimaida.
trace it.
got a hit on Svetlana Vhernitskaya.
"hit" being the erative word.
she was the handler for Anatoly Kov, a KGB hit man who started selling his services to the highest bidder after the cold war ended.
Anaty disappeared in 1999.
boss!
uh, sir. Got a trace on that cell phone.
it's the south side, narrowing it down.
all right, we got the street and... number.
delete it.
you want us to... - stay.
status, Mcgee.
Gibbs out there. Vance out there. Natasha out there. Us here.
what are we doing?
waiting for the fireworks.
Hello, Natasha.
or do you prefer Svetlana?
not business, this is personal.
it was you who kill Anatoly.
what was he to you?
everything.
why now?
because it took me until now to find you.
the night he died, a woman came to kill you. What happened?
she couldn't do it.
can you?
you were going to go for that, weren't you, probie?
Franks: So Jenny couldn't do it?
girl was an artist with the steady.
not back then.
what changed? - Me.
she made her own choices.
I taught her how to accept.
none of that came natal to her.
girl cared for you.
had a lot of regrets.
we all do.
they're going to have your ass when they find her body.
they're not going to find her body.
Hey, Mike.
little late for a stroll.
is that what I think it is?
it was sanctioning.
nine years ago.
your point?
Decker's insurance policy, what's in it?
you can read it for yourself.
I'll leave it for you in my way.
this has been one big screw-up from start to finish.
what do I tell secretary?
whatever you want.
reporter: These pictures are coming live to us from our ZNN team here in Georgetown.
now, the fire is believed to be at the home of the director of a federal agency here in Washington.
the alarm was raised by a passerby who heard an explosion and saw smoke billowing from a downstairs window...
by the time the fire trucks arrived, the house was fully engulfed in flames.
there has been no word yet if anyone was inside the house at the time the fire started.
fire officials are confident...
the memorial of the head of a federal agency was held today...
what's the story circulating on Natasha?
heard she pulled a roman holiday. Ran off with her lover.
Tony: Shotgun wedding.
the funeral was held this morning for NCIS director Jenny Shepard, who died when her Georgetown home was destroyed by fire...
I find this whole business utterly distasteful.
when leaking gas was ignited by a pilot light.
the official report found director Shepard died of smoke inhalation.
at today's private memorial service, one mourner, who declined to give his name, said director Shepard had dedicated her life to serving her country, and would be remembered for her courage, determination and loyalty.
assistant director Leon Vance has been named to succeed her.
could you have Gibbs, Dinozzo, Mcgee and David come up, please?
right away, director.
bad few days.
officer David.
the liaison positi with NCIS is being terminated.
you' going home.
I'm moving you across to the cyber crimes unit.
you'll be working with officer Hollsworth, starting tomorrow.
sir?
you've been reassigned.
Agena afloat, USS Ronald Reagan.
pack your bags; you fly tomorrow.
agent Gibbs.
meet your new team.
Oh. come on, man.
get out!
let's go, buddy. Time to go, buddy.
that's no way to treat a Marine.
ease up, Sergeant. Let's go home.
where is my...
I left my credit card in the bar. Come on.
Sarge. Get it tomorrow.
there is no tomorrow, LaCombe.
I'm going around front.
know what? I think the sergeant is a little drunk.
but you're fine, right, sailor?
attention, Corporal Taylor.
Ethan. Hang on, man. Hang on.
help! Help!
none of the bar staff heard anything.
apparently, they like their music real loud.
discourages talking.
encourages drinking and other mouth-related activities.
the camera's been disabled. Looks like the dumpster's been moved, too.
Yeah. Hiding place. Already thought about it.
Mozart and Mayhem.
a little early for formal attire?
Oh, really?
I'd say late. Looks like Ducky got lucky.
you've never heard of a night at the opera?
sure. Groucho as Otis P. Driftwood.
marx Brothers at their most hilarious.
love the part where they rip up the contract.
that's no good-a for you. It's no good-a for me.
single blunt-force trauma to the sternum.
at least one broken rib.
Ziva, I'm gonna need you to bag some wood chips for me.
it could be a baseball bat.
major league ass-kicking.
EMTs declared Taylor dead at the scene a little after 3: 00 a. m.
how's the other fella?
corporal Ethan LaCombe, rushed to the hospital.
multiple fractures, internal bleeding.
they're prepping him for brain surgery right now.
how ironic.
LaCombe managed to survive a vicious attack, while you have the bad luck to die from what appears to be a single blow.
three of you were together?
I ran inside to get my card.
I left him.
there's no way you could've known, Sergeant.
I should have.
I'm supposed to know everything about them.
what about Corporal LaCombe?
Oh, Ethan. Funny as all hell.
throws a baseball that'll sting your hand for a week.
but other than that, Ethan's a mystery.
hometown?
never wanted to talk about it.
wears a class ring on his right hand.
his eyes would glaze over, and he'd just start twisting that thing.
sand would get under it, rub his finger raw.
he never took that thing off.
I didn't press him, you know?
but he's hiding something back there.
why don't you go get yourself to a hospital, Marine.
Yes, sir.
camera on the alleyway, boss.
been KO'd. Time stamp puts it about a half hour before the fight.
this wasn't a bar brawl, McGee. This was an ambush.
that was pristine.
would you like us to put them on the floor?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
that's what it's for: swabbing the deck, clearing the runway, ready for takeoff.
garbage in, garbage out.
tidy on the outside makes tidy on the inside.
feng shui the gray matter.
and now, to make sense of the chaos.
cigarette butts, food wrapper...
what is that, cheese?
recovered from the alleyway where the attack took place.
other one's personal effects-- what the corporals had on them.
might want to start with LaCombe.
least he's still alive.
there's blood on his ring; it's bent.
it's from impact.
got a few punches in.
might give us DNA.
might give us more than that.
Stillwater High School.
that supposed to mean something to us?
Stillwater High School.
in all that time that you two spend staring at computer screens, you never once peeked in the man's file? Come on!
whose file?
Stillwater is a small town in Pennsylvania coal country.
primarily known for the mine, but only slightly less well known as the birthplace of one Leroy Jethro Gibbs.
this guy is from Gibbs' hometown.
corporal LaCombe's medical report.
surgeon performed a craniotomy on his frontal lobe to relieve the pressure.
he'll survive?
well, they're cautiously optimistic.
right now, he's in a drug-induced coma until the swelling subsides.
this is more than you can say for his friend here.
corporal Taylor. Cause of death?
it's a bit of an oddity.
single blunt-force trauma, but he had a prior injury, a fractured vertebrosternal rib.
it was re-fractured by the blow.
the point of the rib went through his pericardium and penetrated his left ventricle, causing him to bleed to death.
a result of the beating.
Yes. But his wasn't nearly as severe as that taken by LaCombe.
in addition to his skull fracture,
LaCombe had thoracic spine fractures from multiple blunt-force traumas, left-side pneumothorax-- that's collapsed lung-- and a ruptured spleen.
I mean, without encroaching on your territory, Jethro, might I suggest...
that the dead guy was a dead end.
LaCombe was the target. - Yeah.
any idea why?
I just started looking, Duck.
I've heard whispers that your search might take you to Stillwater, Pennsylvania.
Ah, it may.
digging into a man's past, no telling what it might unearth.
so many questions.
my mind is spinning with questions.
I mean, have you ever thought about it?
he actually came from somewhere. He didn't just appear, you know.
he didn't just start Gibbs. He was a boy.
and then he grew.
I thought he was molded from clay, had life breathed into him by a group of mystics.
that's funny, I thought he fell to Earth in a capsule after his home planet exploded.
no, he burst forth full-grown from the mind of Zeus.
nice.
he is the avatar of Vishnu.
he was sent to be the left hand of Yahweh.
he was grown in a cabbage patch.
I'm trying to pose a serious metaphysical question here.
you want to be clever? I can be clever.
just a matter of time, DiNozzo.
tracing the moves of LaCombe and Taylor's squad, boss.
they returned from Iraq three weeks ago, arrived at Lejeune.
no outgoing e-mails, no telephone calls, no visitors.
LaCombe?
just, uh, one aunt on the mother's side: Janet LaCombe.
lives in Stillwater, Pennsylvania.
so I've heard.
Abby lifted traces of anthracite off one of the splinters we recovered.
it's like coal dust, like you find in a coal mine.
road trip.
on your six, boss.
follow up with the Taylor family.
but I...
on it.
hate you. Take lots of pictures.
printed out directions, boss.
Yeah, I know how to get there, McGee.
so when was the last time you went home?
I make it a point to go home every night.
well, I mean, when was the last time you went to Stillwater?
I'd just joined the Corps.
summer '76.
what was it like when you left?
whole lot of fanfare.
fireworks, parades...
might have been the bicentennial.
well, that didn't take long.
you know, if you had a little tennis ball buzz cut instead of that salt and pepper, you'd remind me of this skinny little wise-ass I used to know.
why didn't you tell me you was coming?
not sure it's worth your trouble.
heard you was a Fed now.
never imagined we'd end up on the same side, huh?
no. No, never.
how you been, Ed?
after 30 years?
well, let's see, um...
remember Debbie Leonard? Knocked her up. Married, kids.
my kid had a kid, calls me Pappy.
you know how it goes.
anything I can help you with?
far as the police work goes.
I'll let you know.
you do that, Leroy.
old friend?
check with DiNozzo. Find out how LaCombe's doing.
boss, there a reason you didn't call ahead?
of course there is.
if someone around here had a grudge to settle with Ethan LaCombe, why let them know we're coming?
Yes.
we need to talk to you about your nephew.
about Ethan? He's dead.
uh, no, Miss LaCombe. We didn't mean to give you that impression.
Ethan is still alive.
he was badly injured in an attack.
he's in a hospital in Virginia currently.
Ethan's in a hospital?
Oh, my Lord. I can't believe it.
I thought he died four years ago.
Ethan's alive!
afraid you're not going to have much luck.
occasionally, when the wind is right, you can get a signal.
thank you.
is there a public phone around here I could use?
there's one in my store. My name's Jackson.
well, Ziva, it looks like you dropped something.
kind of tells a story, doesn't it?
a $20 bill in your wallet is just a piece of paper.
you put it on the ground and, suddenly, it's full of wonder.
context can change a thing.
that it can.
for instance, I'll bet, back in, uh...
israel, you were considered a pretty girl.
you step one foot in my country and, instantly, you're an exotic beauty.
when did we start talking about people?
well, if the "I" in NCIS is to be believed, you're observant enough to realize that all this is a pretext for engaging a young woman in conversation.
miss LaCombe, we need to ask you a few more questions before you head to the hospital.
I'm sorry. I'm just... Ethan.
his mom-- my sister-- she was a wild child.
we knew she'd die young.
where was his father?
who was his father?
not exactly easy to narrow it down, if you get my drift.
boy took after his mother regardless.
got into all sorts of trouble.
what kind of trouble?
got in some fights, stole a car.
did some time for that.
blew out of here not too long after he got out.
he have any enemies?
from around here? Don't you get it?
the whole town thought he was dead.
boss, you think maybe we've taken something of a wrong turn?
everyone in town thought he was dead already.
maybe he wanted it that way.
word travels fast.
that it does.
when people actually open their mouths and speak with one another.
you don't call. You don't write.
were you going to come by and say hi?
Hi...Jack.
Hi...Leroy.
jackson Gibbs. My father.
this is a pretty nice setup you got here, Mr. Gibbs.
Jack.
you got to stay up with technology, Tim.
otherwise, you concede to time inch by inch.
not that it's worth the while.
is this Nepal? - Yeah.
it was my 60th birthday, and I climbed 13, 000 feet.
I thought I'd give myself a victory cigar, forgetting how thin the air was, and I passed out.
next thing I know, a Sherpa was giving me mouth-to-mouth.
but I always make it a point to return home after every adventure, unlike some people I know.
does he ever talk about me-- my boy?
I think I heard him refer to you once as dead.
uh, you probably misheard him, McGee.
think she's right. Uh, I think he probably said "Dad.
well...
Hey, what... what's the story on that picture there? That looks interesting.
it's the grand opening of the store.
me and LJ opened it after too many close calls in the mines.
I-is that the, uh, gun you learned to shoot with?
no one was ever allowed to touch that Winchester.
Yeah, let that be a lesson in parenting.
tell a kid he can't have a rifle and he grows up to be a sniper.
can I get you something to eat, Leroy?
can't. Case.
well, least I can help you with that.
I had a few beers with Ethan LaCombe.
gee, I'm shocked.
Leroy could never see the benefit of keeping a six-pack on ice.
he'd spend all his time out in the garage working on some project.
we didn't even have electricity out there.
I can see it.
one day, he blew all his money on some wreck that he picked up at a junkyard.
he was going to rebuild it from the spark plugs up.
never did get it running.
and where do you keep her?
I can't hang on to every piece of junk.
no, just your junk.
what were we talking about?
Ethan, yeah, yeah. Good kid. Little reckless.
most people liked him.
except Winslow up there. - Chuck Winslow?
Yeah, your old buddy.
owns the Winslow Mining Company?
that's the one.
Ethan had a kind of a thing for his daughter Emily.
she married Nick Kingston.
that was before Ethan took off for greener pastures.
now, where are you going?
you're not going to walk up there and start accusing people, are you?
I thought I'd drive.
now, don't go doing anything stupid.
if you're dead set on going another round with Chuck Winslow, this is the least you can do.
you'd be amazed what you can get done with a kind word.
I'll show you.
uh, boss, we'll, uh, we'll wait here.
I'll call Tony. - I'll call Abby.
what do you got, Abs?
I found three distinct blood samples on LaCombe's ring.
one sample belongs to LaCombe, but he definitely got some punches in.
if we're really lucky, our bad guys have some marks on them.
you heard anything?
from Hazzard County? No, not yet.
look, There's our good boy.
I got 'em. - Hey, Luke. How's Uncle Jesse?
Gibbs has a father.
tell me everything.
his name is Jackson. He's a good talker. He may have winked at me.
Gibbs is very different around him.
different how? Different bad, different good?
he's like a teenager, sort of.
okay, I'm coming. I'm going. I'm leaving. - Me, too.
no, you can't, not unless you've found a way the people in town might have thought Ethan LaCombe was alive.
they thought he was dead?
wait, I have that. I wrote that down.
hang on, I, I found it. Here.
see, look, that's a video link.
type that in and, and, uh...
Yeah, there. There it is. You see him?
this is from Iraq?
Yeah, that's him.
LaCombe was tagged in the video's content.
just posted before his squad came home.
I'm impressed with your Internet savvy, Tony. How'd you find that?
I used Google.
not so impressive; Gibbs probably could have done that.
what? - Where is Gibbs?
haven't you forgotten something?
how you doing, Nick?
Hey, Jack.
this is my son Leroy, an old friend of your father-in-law's.
no, come on in, Leroy.
did I hear someone say Leroy?
stop the presses. Got a new headline.
local boy makes good.
not as good as you, Chuck.
Oh, that's kind of you to say.
just hard work and sweat...
mostly other peoples'.
sit. Let's crack this bottle.
Emily, let me help you with that.
Oh, that's woman's work, Jack.
take a load off.
bring us some glasses, would you, sweetheart?
sure, Daddy.
home is the sailor, home from the sea.
so the poem goes. - Here you go.
no offense. I know you're a Marine through to the bone.
what brings you back?
another Marine-- Ethan LaCombe.
must be a night for raising the dead.
haven't heard that boy's name in years.
he's not dead.
Really? Well, rumor was, uh, he drowned in, in Alaska.
what was it, honey?
fishing.
he had that mean streak in him. What do you call it?
uh, thrill-seeker, death wish?
just shows to go you can't always get what you want.
Leroy is just doing some background research, all very standard.
NCIS insists you, you beat all the bushes.
particularly with murder.
murder? You said the boy was alive.
Yeah, he is. His friend isn't. We're still looking for a motive.
well, we, we haven't seen Ethan since he lit out of here, uh...
what was it then? Six years ago?
you know, he tried to run off with my girl, but she came to her senses.
no, Ethan was the wrong boy for my daughter.
she chose the right man.
so what kind of clues you following, Sherlock?
blood.
attackers left traces on his ring.
his ring?
Yeah. Class ring. Just like that.
that's odd; Ethan never graduated high school.
this isn't exactly the kind of after-dinner conversation I expected, Chuck.
no, no, no, no. I'm interested.
tell me about the blood.
well, it can be used to convict a suspect.
or rule somebody out, of course.
and you got a reason to believe there's a suspect around here?
not yet.
daddy, Daddy.
Oh, hey, there, buddy. This is my son Chris.
Chris, you're getting awful big. How old are you now?
he's, uh, he's five.
five and three-quarters.
that's right, big guy.
thanks for the drink. - Come here, sweetie.
everybody's always lying to you all the time.
can't you ever take things as you see 'em?
I see people lying to me.
you were such a happy child.
boss, I talked to Tony and Abby.
boss?
you make them call you that?
he's not a...
are you a boss, Leroy?
blood traces from LaCombe's ring will help us ID two of his attackers.
as far as how they found him, LaCombe's squad in Iraq made a video and put it on the Net.
it was posted a month ago, and already has almost half million hits.
it's a lot of data to sift through, but I can tell who's seen it.
you can do that?
you can tell everything I've been looking at?
what have you been looking at?
none of your business.
see, using, uh, service-provider accounts, I can cross-reference the static IPs...
McGee... I'm tired.
I can conclusively say that this video has been viewed from the Winslows' home account.
someone in that house knew Ethan LaCombe was still alive.
well, you see, anybody could have found that.
I mean, anybody could have known how to find him.
it could have been anyone.
but they lied to me about it.
Yeah. It's good coffee.
Yeah, I know.
morning, Gibbs.
Gibbses.
corporal LaCombe briefly regained consciousness, but, uh, he has no memory of the attack.
Tony's trying to secure a court order for the Winslow family.
to take blood samples, financial records.
who is this Tony?
he will be driving up this afternoon.
so, how's it go?
you line up people you don't like and make 'em give you blood?
it's not personal.
sure, it is.
one of those guys put that kid in the hospital killed his friend.
Yeah, and you know this how?
I can feel it.
feelings. That sounds very personal to me.
I do this for a living.
some living.
just to let you feel superior to everybody else.
what do you want me to do?
why do you say you think they're responsible?
how about getting some more evidence first?
how about that? How about DNA?
I thought everything was DNA now.
it's a shame. I was really starting to like him.
me, too.
and Gibbs sure is bending over backwards to accommodate him.
he needs to be himself.
can I help you folks?
sure you want to make that offer?
depends on what you're looking for.
anything that may carry traces of DNA.
this dumpster is on a public access road, so we are able...
and willing. - To go through it.
looking for treasures like this.
does that bother you?
Yeah, it's a... It's a little off-putting.
here. Let me help.
I appreciate you making an effort not to tear the town apart.
you give people a chance, they might surprise you.
that's what worries me.
tell me about this investigator thing of yours.
we haven't talked since you started it.
it's $1. 75
in fact, we haven't talked since the funeral.
I adored that wife of yours.
and I adored that child, too.
always figured it was Shannon that sent me the Christmas cards.
well, it's like what you do.
what, selling groceries?
no. You like to tell a story.
well, I've been known to spin a yarn or two.
Yeah, most of mine start with a dead body.
you look into how they got that way, they come back to life.
two and a quarter.
meet the people they knew.
you see what they try to show you.
you read what they try to hide.
people come in here all the time.
tell me their life stories at the drop of a hat.
what are they trying to hide?
insecurity.
need assurance their life means something.
what did I do at the funeral?
you mean, other than showing up with a date?
I always thought that your mom and I had a love story for the ages.
I never regretted giving up the skies, working underground every day in the mines.
I wanted to give you that white, picket-fence dream.
and you did.
but you see...
things did not work out between your mom and me.
when she died, I know how mad that made you.
I know how you hated me for getting on with my life.
I saw the look in your face.
how you wanted vengeance.
and that look went away when you met Shannon, but it came back quick after they died.
I knew what that meant.
you were gonna find someone to take it out on.
didn't matter what I said.
it never did.
what do you see now?
Oh, Chuck. Ed.
I've got some complaints to register on behalf of my employees.
you've been sifting through their trash.
I told you to come to me if you needed anything.
you did. I will.
be civilized, Leroy.
you ask me, I think this is about a grudge.
I got Ethan LaCombe's juvenile record unsealed.
that car he stole belonged to you.
the arrest report was written by Ed here.
you made sure he did time.
we are law-abiding citizens.
I can't tolerate that kind of behavior.
you just couldn't get rid of him.
you want to settle the score?
why don't we handle it like men?
I know how you two handle things.
get off him!
get off of me!
hold him, Ed.
that's enough!
next time, when your daddy's not around, I'm gonna kill you.
next time, when your buddy's not around, Chuck, I'm gonna kill you.
sure you want to pick this fight?
wasn't my choice.
you feel that?
what? Week-old bananas?
no. We are being watched.
how do you do that?
Hi. You must be Emily.
you're with Agent Gibbs.
here about... Ethan. - You know him?
we were very... close...
before he left.
those feelings do not go away overnight.
no. They don't.
I found him on the Internet.
the video of his squad?
you never believed he was dead?
I didn't want to.
but I was starting to...
I just wanted to talk to him again.
I made some calls.
he was my best friend.
is that all? - Yes.
Emily, who knew?
you want to get off my property?
are we finished here, McGee?
finished.
okay.
well, boss, we got a load of garbage in the car.
I'm sure Abby will have a field day sifting through it for... DNA.
and we found out who saw the video. It was Emily.
there a reason you're not on the road, McGee?
listen, boss, I-I understand that you're treating this case differently.
some might say with kid gloves.
but not me. I wouldn't say that.
boss, you're gonna start busting in doors at some point, right?
dragging people out in handcuffs.
tossing 'em in a room, lean on 'em till they break.
personally, I think it works for you.
yesterday you thought I'd made a wrong turn.
well, that was yesterday.
today I'm not moving fast enough.
I didn't mean to...
want to frontload complaints for tomorrow, McGee, or do I have to wait until the sun comes up?
what was that?
everybody okay?
Yeah, fine.
all of our evidence was in there.
what now?
all right, let's do it your way.
Hi, guys.
pass a lot of Volkswagen Beetles on your way up?
Abby cheats at punch-buggy. - I know.
what does it look like?
like someone stuffed a rag in a gas tank and lit the fuse.
and toasted our DNA.
Where's Gibbs?
waiting for you inside.
I'll get my gear. - What about Senior?
all right.
Hello? - Hi, I'm...
DiNozzo, court order.
Winslow Residence, Winslow Mine, including employees.
you got a court order for a five-year-old?
Five-and-three-quarter. Have Abby set up here. We'll bring her evidence.
take Ziva and McGee to the mine. I got the residence.
Oh, we got a problem. Uh, only one car.
I got a car.
426 Hemi.
R/T suspension package, just the way you wanted it.
right down to the color.
are we gonna stand here staring, or are we gonna get going?
that's right. I said "we.
well, hey, there. You Nick Kingston?
now what are you looking for?
I got a court order here to take your blood.
your employees, too.
you're gonna make us?
well, yeah, Nick, that's what the little piece of paper's for.
I hope I'm not interrupting dinner.
now, that's the man I remember.
just bust in before you know what's going on.
I know. - What do you know?
daddy? You okay?
it's nothing, sweetheart. Go back upstairs.
well, you really didn't want Ethan around your daughter.
you give him the same threat you gave me?
well, the boy was smart enough to stay gone.
not forever. Emily found him.
so I went after him?
no, no, no, that's not the way you work.
you'd get somebody else to do it.
Hello, Ed. - Jack.
got a report of a disturbance up here.
a lot of that going on tonight.
too much.
why don't we sit this one out?
come back for blood.
that's got some poetry to it, Leroy.
Yeah. What's it gonna tell me, Chuck?
well, I'm glad that went smooth.
can't even remember where I keep the shells for this thing.
boss, according to the time cards from the Winslow offices, these two were working in the mines on Friday.
notice the signatures?
but according to their blood... - What do you got, Abs?
I'm just double-checking my results.
it's a wonder.
well, it's more accurate to match DNA from a blood sample at a crime scene to a source than it is to create an entire profile, but in a pinch.
I narrowed it down by type; then I centrifuged the samples to separate serum for electrophoresis.
it's not that complicated, Jack.
well, I mean, it's a wonder that Leroy gets any work done surrounded by such beautiful women.
are you always this awkward around girls?
so, these two are the samples taken from the crime scene and the ring.
these guys attacked LaCombe and Taylor.
now, the other sample is LaCombe's.
here's where it gets interesting.
see these dark markers here and here?
Bisalbuminemia.
what does that mean?
well, it's a genetically inherited blood anomaly.
they also appear in this sample.
the owner of this sample is related to LaCombe.
father and son? - Yep.
I guess you were right about people hiding things.
Ed's locking up those two boys from the mine.
for killing Taylor.
trying to kill Ethan.
he'll live.
I thought you'd want to know.
since he's family.
what do you mean? - Blood relative.
I knew it. - Nick...
Chris is his son. I always knew it.
no.
I was already pregnant when he got out of prison.
it broke his heart, but he didn't want to tear apart our family.
you won.
you gave him your ring.
but I never slept with him.
I swear. - I don't believe you.
well, you should.
Chris is your son.
and Ethan is yours.
dad?
I couldn't let the two of you...
brother and sister.
now you know.
why didn't you ever say so?
it would have meant acknowledging an heir to your fortune.
you sent them after Ethan?
I've done a lot of things in my life, but...
even you wouldn't try to kill your own son.
you signed the time cards for those two miners.
they weren't there, but you knew where they really were.
get up.
why couldn't you ever just believe me?
shotgun. - Shotgun.
called it first. - Called it first.
what?
Jack, I just, uh... I mean, I... I don't want to be intrusive.
it was so nice to meet you.
she is a hugger.
fantastic.
uh, Jack, I... I just... I gotta know some things. I got a lot of questions.
you can have two, DiNozzo.
where do I start? - You got one left.
well, that doesn't count, 'cause that...
okay... the rules.
did he learn them from you?
I mean, did you teach him all the rules?
I'm sorry, son. I didn't teach him much of anything.
he taught me to drive.
Oh, no, boss, not backseat, middle hump. I... I got that...
that thing we talked about. - Take them.
it's just cluttering up the garage.
you're a great man, Jackson Gibbs.
thanks for the sweater.
I know you hate it when I use a hundred words when a couple will do.
but give us a call sometime.
it's the least I could do.
good-bye, son.
Bye, Dad.
what were you and those guys fighting about?
I don't even remember.
you should stop.
are you waiting for the train, too?
we could sit together.
I don't know. It's a long ride.
but I guess you're not a lumberjack.
no.
well, I have a rule. It's either rule #1 or #3.
never date a lumberjack.
you got a rule for everything? - Working on it.
everyone needs a code they can live by.
what's your name?
I'm just gonna call you Gibbs.
you can call me anything you want.
I'm Shannon.
Hello?
hello.
Oh, Alice, it's just me.
that's the third time you've done that to me this year.
you know I don't like surprises.
Yeah, well... Surprise.
it's our one-month anniversary.
I knew there was a reason I married you.
I'll be right back. - Be right here.
okay. All right. Little Barry.
Alice, what's wrong?
run for your life, probie, run.
what are you doing?
just trying to save your life.
what did you do?
why do you assume it's me? That's a good point, - but in this case, actually... - McGee!
too late.
why is she sitting at my...
you're on your own, probie.
McGee, get in here!
plead temporary insanity. It's your best bet.
what did I tell you, McGee?
about what?
I told you to destroy those... twice.
I did. I did. No. I... I-I didn't, um...
Tony. Tony. Tony must have...
what, when you went to get coffee?
you did not erase those photos, did you?
admit it, and I will spare you one of your eyes.
I did not erase those photos.
I think I know what happened. Um, I-I-I-I...
I just deleted my old screensaver, and theoretically, the operating system could have defaulted to the photo directory, but, you know, the odds...
today's not your lucky day.
it is Halloween later this week.
and I did see a black cat this morning.
well, it was... it was dark brown.
give me your hand.
better than losing an eye, McGee.
let's go.
what do we got, boss? - What do we got?
we got a...
it's a good question, DiNozzo.
my-my mother isn't quite herself today.
psycho.
you certainly have your moments.
the movie, Ziva.
Norman Bates. Shower scene.
looks like their night was ruined.
I am going to ruin McGee's whole year.
don't you think you're being a little uptight about this photo thing?
no, really. What do you think he's doing with it?
I would rather shave my eyeballs than contemplate that.
blood is human, boss. Not pure, but, uh, enough to make Janet Leigh scream.
we thought it prudent to notify Ducky, given the amount.
source?
McGee's still looking for it.
mother! Blood! Blood!
psycho.
he has his moments.
I spoke to the colonel in charge of base operations.
these outlying homes receive their water from local aquifers.
water's drawn into holding tanks and distributed to these smaller nodes.
pumped to the houses as needed.
it's a technology as old as the hills.
at Skara Brae in Scotland, as I recall, a Neolithic stone village was uncovered, complete with plumbing.
Dr. Mallard?
sorry. I'll go get the wrap.
you can drain it. - Yes, sir.
some bloating, to be expected with the submersion.
however, that man has not been in that tank more than 24 hours.
that your time of death?
perhaps.
as to the cause, these lacerations were made postmortem.
note the styrofoam-ish aspect to the wounds.
Oh, blunt-force trauma to the head, but I doubt that's a fatal blow.
I can also rule out drowning.
Yes, were that the case, even with the immersion, there would be conspicuous amounts of froth on his nose and mouth.
Hello, hello, hello. What have we here?
Mr. Palmer, get his chin.
open wide.
Ah, the plot thickens.
what does that say? A Web site?
Primitus-victor. com is just a placeholder.
the link redirects to a CyberVid video.
Cyber... vid?
anyone can upload anything, and anyone can watch it.
you know, boss, like, uh, LonelyGirl15?
evolution of Dance? - Numa Numa Guy.
Yeah. - How cute.
you got to see this. There he goes.
I love this guy.
sorry. Back to... Back to our video.
we're the first viewers.
what is this?
that's our dead guy.
Oh, don't get in the van, man.
what was that?
ID?
no hits on the victim's prints yet.
I'm still running the DNA.
the CyberVid account and redirect links were opened at an Internet cafe in Richmond anonymously a month ago.
someone might remember something. - Go.
talk to security at Quantico.
see who didn't show up for work.
um, Gibbs?
Primitus victor-- it's Latin. It means first victim.
Yeah. I know, Abs.
this never gets old.
Ah, nice timing, Jethro.
I thought you'd like to see what we've found in our scans.
or rather, what we didn't find.
his brain... is missing!
there's no need to get so excited, Mr. Palmer.
where did it go?
well, it appears to have been removed trans-nasally in a manner similar to that used by the ancient Egyptians prior to mummification, most likely using a tool similar to this.
a missing brain, and so close to Halloween.
that's enough to make you want to...
go clean some pipettes.
postmortem?
well, judging by the intracranial hemorrhaging,
I believe the entire cerebrum was removed when he was still alive.
unconscious, of course, but alive, until of course, he wasn't.
Thanks, Duck.
at which point, he was frozen.
frozen?
Abby's tissue analysis shows massive cellular ruptures that indicate the body was frozen.
so, time of death?
Oh, not something that I can determine with any degree of accuracy.
perhaps that was the intent.
perhaps not.
there are many parts to this puzzle, Jethro.
it's not a puzzle, Duck.
a game?
Oh, it's one that this poor fellow lost.
victim's name is Billy Cole.
26, native of Virginia.
civilian? - Yeah. Cole worked at a local car wash.
Abby got a hit off his DNA.
two years ago, he donated his sperm.
Ah, the things people will do for money.
you donated your sperm.
didn't do that for the money. Just to enrich the world.
so, boss, I spoke to security at Quantico.
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I interrupt?
let's see who the boss likes better.
security at Quantico insists no one could have gotten past their checkpoints with a body.
might have used one of the rivers, but how do you drag a dead guy two miles through the water unless...
it was frozen.
no. I was gonna say, unless you had one of those James Bond submersible sleds from Thunder ball, but froze n's good. Float him right in.
what else you got?
actually...
you know, actually, I don't have anything else.
Cole had no criminal record, and, uh, no one reported him missing.
any connection to the couple on base?
as far as I can tell, they were the first ones to turn on their water.
well, the killer did leave a message for whoever found the body.
click the click.
a cryptic message.
could be anything.
but we'll figure it out. We can do better.
McGee, Billy Cole's address.
DiNozzo. - On your six, Boss.
Hey, you haven't forgot about that screensaver, have you, Ziva?
actually, I had.
thanks for reminding me.
what are friends for?
nice place. Glad I'm up on my tetanus shots.
everything okay, boss? You seem kind of quiet... er than usual.
you're worried this is just the first?
eh, worried it's not.
federal agents!
we closed the garage door!
Billy disappeared, I don't know, about a week ago.
owed me a couple months' rent.
figured he was just skipping out on us.
I can't believe he's dead.
were you and he...
no. My God, never.
no, just every other guy in the zip code.
we were just roommates.
that's actually the name of our band, Just Roommates.
Billy was our lead guitarist until I found a new one.
the guy just didn't get it. - It?
if you have to ask, you obviously don't get it, either.
need to see his room.
this is his room, Agent...
that's an interesting name.
so now that he's dead, Agent Interesting Name, if he has any money anywhere, you know with the rent he owes us, that would be really...
okay.
what happened? Was it a robbery?
well, that's what we're... trying to figure, ma'am.
should we make you a list? You know, people he knew, phone numbers and stuff?
I watch a lot of TV.
whatever you got.
who was the last one to see him?
I did. He said he was going out for a beer. Never came back.
he does that sometimes.
the guy's got no focus, and I told him when I let him in the band I needed a lead that I could count on.
you know, "no amateurs need apply.
boss. Check this out.
you know where this was taken?
Yeah. Why?
I hate serial killers.
though, at least this one was kind enough to give us the location of the murder.
and the murder weapon.
you know, these things always come in threes, boss.
he gave us the location, the murder weapon, and the time of death.
he's daring us to find him.
someone wasn't hugged enough as a child.
I guess Latin for "second victim.
what's that?
Hello, Agent Gibbs...
anything, anything you want whatever you want. Please, let me go. Please.
please let me go... Where are you?
no, no-no, no, no, no... No, please...
between Mother Theresa and Hitler, I guess there's all kinds.
how does he know who was assigned to the case?
working on it. - Director?
well, we should've seen that coming.
another murder has been posted on the popular...
do I need to tell you SecNav is already breathing down my neck?
if it'll make you feel better.
SECNAV is already breathing down my neck. Now you know.
I'll handle him, you handle this.
park in rural Virginia.
just watch your back, Gibbs.
if the killer's following the same pattern, then each of these clues refers to the time, location and cause of death of the next victim.
Wes Craven he's not.
nightmare on Elm Street. Scream. Swamp Thing.
plenty scary to me. I had nightmares all night.
that's 'cause you're a lily-livered, little chicken pants who sleeps on plastic sheets.
if you are done, I suggest we start with cause of death.
radiation poisoning.
drowning.
killer nun.
maybe we should try location.
uh, some kind of, uh, bombing range?
anchor... age, Alaska?
convent.
is that where they keep the killer nuns?
look, all I'm saying is some of the nuns I knew could get extremely agitated.
tell me you got something better than agitated nuns.
well, we got an ID off dead guy number two's prints, boss.
Bob Simms. 51, former Navy chief.
current address is Central Union Shelter in DC.
he was homeless.
connection to the first victim?
none we could find, unless you count yanking his brain out through his nostrils.
video was uploaded to another anonymous CyberVid account.
that's McGee-speak for "we weren't able to trace that one, either.
I might be able to help with that.
those videos are all over the news.
as soon as I saw them, I knew I had to come in.
I think I know who made them.
it's Tommy's band, but Billy was really the one that made things happen.
I can't believe he's dead.
were you and he, um...
just friends.
I usually like guys that are a little more mature.
older.
the video?
right, um, a while ago, Billy decided we should start promoting ourselves a little more.
answered an ad for this guy who makes music videos.
this is ours.
I'm not really a professional singer.
well, you have a very, um, interesting way of holding the microphone.
no, it's okay.
haven't really figured out what I am yet.
wait, this is it.
name?
director's info's on the disc.
Sam Loomis, Loominosity Pictures.
it's in Arlington.
take DiNozzo.
she's pretty. - She's a good agent.
you guys hiring?
I wouldn't mind hanging out.
I feel safe here.
I can assign an agent to you.
you? - No.
I'll be okay, I guess.
you got a problem, give me a call.
only if you have a problem.
that obvious?
and I was trying to hide it.
another thing I'm not good at.
take care you of yourself, Rose.
I'm working on it.
nice girl.
wasn't my type, though.
Really?
she was breathing.
well, I have standards, Ziva.
otherwise, I'd be dating you.
Hello?
what do you want?
like to ask you a few questions.
sorry. Been robbed once already this month.
we're looking for Sam Loomis.
you're looking at him.
the music video director?
Yeah, and, uh... weddings and I did one bris.
come on in.
well, it's like you died and went to probie heaven.
sorry this place is such a mess.
used to be a lot neater. I was an accountant.
didn't even have e-mail when I retired, and now look at me.
what can I do for you?
do you know...
hang on a second. I, uh...
I hit some tail at the assisted living center across the street, and, uh, now she won't leave me alone.
sorry, uh... yes. I know him. He was my first.
first? - Music video.
I went down to the Apple Store to get an iPod for my grandson, and stayed for the free classes.
and now I pull in five C-notes a month shooting freelance video.
Billy Cole is dead.
Yeah, I know. I saw it on the net.
what does it have to do with me?
your video is very similar to the one the killer left behind.
so that makes me a suspect?
it makes a coincidence and I'm not a big fan of them.
well, actually, it makes about 300, 000 coincidences.
that first video, I didn't have a clue what I was doing.
luckily, I had some help.
been working or surfing the Internet?
both. Sam Loomis used a Web site to make the Just Roommates video, boss.
the link is to a viral ad campaign.
the site lets you upload your own footage and randomly cuts in images it grabs from your photo file.
right. The instant music video killer must've used it for his video.
how many, uh... - Hits.
uh, this site doesn't log IP addresses, so we're going to have to go through them by hand.
it still doesn't let Loomis off the hook.
we're running his alibi right now for the night of the murders. Should we bring him in?
let you know.
aren't you going to say hello, Agent Gibbs?
hello.
you won't be able to trace this call. Not where I am.
yeah? Where's that?
I'm sure you'd like to know, but I'm not going to make it easy.
not for someone like you.
a decorated Marine, Six-time recipient of the Meritorious Civilian Service Award.
Yeah, well, I'll tell you what, after I bring you in, it might just be seven.
I know you'll do your best to find me.
I've been looking for you a long time, Agent Gibbs.
I expect no less.
how's the trace coming?
it's a voice-over IP, boss.
he's bouncing it all over the world.
so determined, so capable...
you know, you and I are a lot alike.
yeah? How's that?
we're both going to hell.
well, I think you should speak for yourself.
a man like you is not easy to find.
and so I have something very special planned for you, Agent Gibbs.
I think you're really going to like it.
sorry, boss.
Yeah, Abs, what do you got?
it's another video, Gibbs. It just popped up. I'm sending the URL now.
ABS, you're sure this is the killer's?
these links usually come with bodies.
Yeah.
I was monitoring the killer's original CyberVid account and I caught this uploading.
Oh, my God. That poster is right outside my lab. He was here.
he walked right by my lab.
Abby, this isn't a flash code. It's H-dot-two-six-four.
Hey, McGee? - Boss, this isn't a video. It's streaming live.
he's outside Abby's lab.
I can see him, Gibbs.
he's right outside my door.
Abby, we're coming, Abs.
lock down the entire building. - Almost there.
meet us on level one! Intruder may be armed.
just hurry.
Freeze!
Ah, hell, Harry.
I'm just here to mop up.
camera's in the cart. I'll check on Abby.
Abby! It's okay. You're...
again with the Krazy Glue.
consider yourself lucky.
it was either that or hydrochloric acid.
did you catch him?
well, we caught somebody.
Jani-cam. That's a new one.
do you really believe Harry's involved?
Gibbs will know soon enough.
I've never been so scared in my whole life.
except when my stalker-ex tried to kill me.
and when my insane assistant, Chip, had me at knifepoint.
and when McGee's crazy fan put a gun to my head...
we-we got it, Abs.
how's Harry?
he's innocent.
he's got an alibi for both murders.
does he have any idea how the camera got in his lunch box?
he was moonlighting last month.
the killer could have planted the camera while Harry was off base.
if he planted the camera a month ago, he couldn't have known Gibbs was assigned to the case.
he was targeting Gibbs from the beginning.
you must have really pissed somebody off.
it's not a short list.
of people that-that you've angered just because you have rock-solid principles and so it's easy for people to misunderstand that, and misconstrue. You know, people...
why don't you quit while you're behind, DiNozzo.
I'm trying.
it's not about me.
whatever it was about, we've had a serious breach in security, not to mention a serial killer still out there.
I've got a press conference in five. How close are we?
the phone call rules out our only suspect.
Sam Loomis was with us when the killer called.
keep me updated.
somebody get McGee a new pair of shoes.
can you trace the signal, Abs?
I don't even know how it was broadcast.
but I'll find out.
just I have two questions.
this video, it's different than the others. Why?
okay, what's the other question?
can I stay with you tonight?
that's why I have something very special planned for you, Agent Gibbs.
what do you have planned?
well, I was hoping you could tell me, Duck.
this is a fascinating individual, Jethro.
I can think of another word for him.
Yeah, crazy.
well, the precise term is narcissistic personality disorder.
Oh, yeah, well, I'm familiar with that, too.
Yes, but where Agent DiNozzo has an excessive need for admiration, he has empathy as well
something our killer lacks.
it's all a game to him.
Yes, and one he has chosen to play with you.
I noticed.
Why?
like all narcissists, he believes himself to be the hero of his own story.
and all heroes need a villain.
apparently, for that role he has cast you.
doesn't care who he kills.
well, he wants his 15 minutes.
he wants to be famous.
and, sadly, the more he kills.
more famous he becomes. - Yeah.
I shudder to think what he has planned for a grand finale.
perhaps some sort of doom...
Yes, I knew I'd seen that before.
the killer's last clues were quite literal.
I suspect the same here.
that countdown likely refers to the time of the next murder.
need something more specific than that.
Yeah, well, this is the doomsday clock;
it's a symbol of how close the human race is to nuclear annihilation.
the clock time changes with the geopolitical situation.
it's currently set to five minutes to midnight.
less than three hours from now.
if Ducky's right, we're already out of time.
if Ducky's right, then the murder location is in one of the other two clues.
Ziva. - I will send alerts to all churches in the area.
DiNozzo. - Uh, shipyards, harbors, and Navy.
McGee. - Yeah, boss?
Hey, Lou, it's DiNozzo.
Oh, um, well, I don't know. Tony and Ziva got the easy ones.
phone call, McGee.
right. Still working on back-tracing the killer's call.
something wrong, boss?
he's playing with us.
he's been playing with us.
got us doing exactly what he wants us to do.
what choice do we have?
you want to evacuate the Navy Yard?
he's coming here.
how do you know?
that could mean anything.
it means his next victim is going to be in the Navy Yard.
Gibbs, I don't know if you've noticed, but we run the Navy out of the Navy Yard, and you just want to abandon ship based on a hunch?
the camera in Harry's cart-- video wasn't for us. It's for him.
you think that was recon.
killer was scouting the base?
NCIS I get, but why evacuate the whole Yard?
you can't kill anybody, Leon, if there's no one here to kill.
all right, I'll give you points for the unexpected.
we were going to run a security lockdown drill next week.
move it up.
not sure if I hope you're right or wrong.
Yeah, McGee.
boss, I was running the killer's call through a spectrum analyzer and I noticed that...
the call-- the killer wasn't actually on the line. It was a recording.
recording? What do you mean a recording?
sounded like a conversation.
he must have prerecorded segments.
used your voice to trigger generalized responses.
could have been anywhere. Anybody.
not anybody.
Abby's been working on the Jani-cam.
she was able to get a print off the lens.
explains the timing of the killer's call to you.
loomis had it prerecorded in case we got too close.
what better way to look innocent than have the killer call while he was in our presence?
alibi doesn't check out.
boss.
five minutes to spare.
boy, you guys must really not have any other suspects.
Oh, we got enough.
Where'd you get that?
look familiar?
Yeah, I used to shoot time-lapse shots with it.
it got stolen from my place about a month ago.
did you report it?
no. I fired my cleaning lady.
what? It's hot in here.
feels fine to me.
man's got an uncanny ability.
should run his own sweat lodge.
tell me about Billy Cole.
look, talk to Sally Hardesty at Sunshine Retirement.
I was with her at the time of the murders.
she said she doesn't remember.
she's old. You know, she never remembers my name. Just, uh...
you ask her about Magic Fingers.
Oh, boy. It's all you, probie.
I hear you're good on a computer.
what, is that a crime now?
well, depends on what you're doing.
this how you reinvented yourself, Sam?
you-you got no right to do this to me!
sit down.
I pay my taxes. I could have... my whole life I've done what I've been told.
I'm a good person! - Something's wrong.
sit down!
I will not sit down!
I didn't do anything wrong!
help me.
call Base medical.
ems is on the way.
the Virgin Mary he's not, Jethro.
he was poisoned.
Abby found traces of fludrocortisone in a patch he wore on his skin for arthritis.
it made his blood pressure skyrocket, which in turn...
heart attack.
well, that's putting it mildly.
his eyes?
that's a result of the increase in vascular pressure.
no doubt done for dramatic effect.
our killer is nothing, if not a showman.
nice timing.
Yeah, well, the advantage of a transdermal delivery system is that it's remarkably precise.
Jethro, it's not every day that you suffer a setback in a case.
setback?
this man died in your custody.
was murdered in my custody.
exactly, right under your nose.
I can imagine how you must feel.
what's your point?
my concern is that the killer knows how you feel.
he's pushing you for some reason.
you're the arch enemy in this narrative that he's constructed.
one cannot help but wonder: towards what is he pushing you?
Yeah, Gibbs. - More bad news, boss.
I'll be right up.
Oh, no.
fourth video just appeared, boss.
he's using a proxy server in China.
I'm running a snooper now, but I wouldn't hold your breath.
let's see it.
I guess you really must not have any other suspects.
that's the camera in our interrogation room.
it's hot in here.
you got no right to do this to me.
sit down.
no, I will not sit down. I did nothing wrong.
help me.
is this supposed to mean you're next, boss?
the killer's never shown the victim's face before.
we will not let anything happen to you, Gibbs...
if you want, I can...
what I want is to know how he got that footage.
he has it because we sent it to him.
and by "we," I mean me.
I was trying to figure out how the killer was broadcasting a live stream through Harry's Jani-cam, and I uploaded the firmware to try to track it, and I got herpes.
she means a computer virus, boss.
um, yeah, and the camera then uploaded a Trojan horse to the mainframe that hijacked our internal security system.
it's been cyber-casting our interrogation room cameras for over 24 hours.
disable it.
Oh, I did. I'm just... I'm so sorry, Gibbs.
not your fault, Abby.
it's your face on there, Gibbs. You're the next victim.
I'm not anyone's victim.
you could be dying of poison right now.
the killer could have put a bomb in your cell phone, Gibbs.
okay. No bomb, but still...
we don't know what this video means.
we know that someone's gonna die in less than an hour.
trojan horse-- can you trace it?
I tried, Gibbs. I couldn't even trace the Jani-cam.
I mean, the killer is bouncing signals.
did you try both together?
you are a god amongst men.
the Jani-cam and the Trojan horse are outgoing sources.
now we have two.
if we turn them both on...
we can triangulate back to the killer.
or you could just stand there looking at me.
releasing the Trojan horse.
Re-initializing the camera.
carrier signals are broadcasting.
trying to hide behind the Great Firewall of China, but...
we got 'em.
video is being rerouted to a DSL account registered to...
local LEOs are at Rose's place.
neighbors say she just left.
hasn't seen the roommate in two days, and boss...
there's blood all over his room.
no recent credit card activity, but I did find this.
rose registered this trademark two weeks ago.
CyberVid Killer.
smart-- imagine how much money Manson would have made if he owned the name, Helter Skelter.
gets better: her father was an Egyptologist.
Oh, well, that explains the savvy with the nose-pick from hell.
killer's last video.
whatever it means, we've got less than 30 minutes to figure it out.
if it means Gibbs is the victim, then we should just stay right here.
and if I'm not?
someone else dies.
where is that?
sears Tower. Chicago.
Moscow.
Rio.
death by jet lag?
the clue is not the city.
clue is the snow.
boss, I am not a god among men, you are.
I've got it. Now, my CPU is too small.
I'm gonna let that slide.
I'm gonna need a little more time to figure it out.
well, it is the CyberVid Killer.
if McGee wasn't meant to do the heavy lifting, who was?
this is the only video that's contained flash frames.
that is radiographic static, commonly referred to as...
snow.
but it just looks like snow. It's actually encrypted data.
there's another link embedded in the snow.
it's a live video link.
there's the roommate. At least he's still alive.
for now.
got our next murder weapon. Shotgun.
and location: that was Loomis's place.
we will go.
if you are the intended victim, this may just be a way to lure you out.
it's working.
less than two minutes.
really wish you'd stayed in the car, boss.
DiNozzo, will you shut up or I'm gonna shoot you.
NCIS! - Drop your weapon, Rose.
I wish I could. I'm sorry.
we will shoot you.
shoot her! She's freaking crazy!
drop it.
please just leave.
somebody shoot her! Please, I don't want to die.
you have three seconds, or we will shoot.
uh, boss?
what the hell are you doing?
put the gun down, Rose.
he said he'd kill me.
are you crazy? Shoot her. Come on!
only one I'm gonna shoot is you.
it's a dead man's switch.
I've got her wired with C-4.
so you shoot me, and we all die.
come on, Gibbs, do you really want to die?
do you?
no, you want to be famous. You don't want to die.
get this the hell off me!
all right, just hold still.
I knew I should have gone with the FBI.
it's cliché, but, look what you get for trying something different.
clear.
he said if I didn't just stand there, he'd kill me.
you said we were shooting another music video!
I hope you fry!
come on, Rose. Come on, let's go.
he set her up. How did you know?
the video camera?
Yes, they had one of those at every murder.
on the victim.
eye was the murder weapon.
total cliché, you know.
you ripped that off from Se7en.
wrong!
at the end of Se7en, the cops killed the serial killer, not another victim.
it's totally different!
doesn't matter. I still win.
you?
you may be the famous Leroy Jethro Gibbs.
but you're...
you're nothing but a set piece.
who caught Gacy, huh? Manson?
I don't know. But Tommy Doyle?
Oh, he's gonna be a household name by the 10: 00 news.
authorities say the CyberVid Killer is in custody.
however, citing possible links to terrorism, officials are not releasing his identity, and details of how they arrested him are being kept under wraps...
thank you and congratulations.
way to go, Marie.
our sources believe we may never know his real name.
Yeah, that's got to hurt.
all that for a question mark.
it's very revealing the lengths that some men will go to thrust themselves into the limelight, while others are content to live quietly ...
...in solitude. - The next award to be presented is the Meritorious Civilian Service Award for demonstrating unusual initiative and a pattern of excellence.
special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs.
agent Gibbs.
I know, come on.
sit down.
why are you hiding?
cause we weren't invited, Lucas.
it's the after party. It belongs to all of us.
an invitation would have been redundant.
it would have been polite.
come on. They're all going to be happy to see us.
they're never happy to see us at lunch.
why would it be so different now?
because.
come on. - Okay.
Hey, guys. Look what we brought.
they don't look so happy.
help. Help, help...
what are you doing, Tony?
best deep-in-thought face.
I guess there's a first time for everything.
nailed it. All right, strawdawg24, beat this one.
Yeah, baby.
I beat you. Come on. The place to compete online with anyone in anything.
Yeah, it's very fun. It's very addictive.
look at this guy. Best air guitar. Look at that guy. Best do The Hustle.
I mean, you name it, they got it.
the Hustle? - The Hustle.
Saturday Night Fever? Travolta.
you know.
what is the point?
what is the point of any dance? It's about letting loose.
it's, you know, having a good time.
I meant the Website, Tony.
it's fun.
it is amusement, light-hearted pleasure.
I know what you're doing. I know how to have fun, Tony.
Really? Do tell.
the hustling and the deep-thinking photos, those are all just, you know, child's play.
tell him, McGee.
uh, I'm working on my best psycho face here.
that's not bad, probie.
just need to work it a little bit at the eyebrow.
see what I'm saying? See how that reads?
see that? That's what you want. - Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah...
would you two like some time alone together?
uh, no, boss. We were just...
acting like children.
you say that like it's a bad thing.
got a dead petty officer in the woods; let's go.
check out the air guitarists yet?
I'm in third place right now.
petty Officer Greg Collins. Twenty-six.
worked as a boatswain's mate on the USSShenandoah.
on 30-day leave.
lives alone in Norfolk.
Gibbs. Found a blood trail, goes this way.
leads back to the car.
run off the road.
you know that just by looking?
listening, DiNozzo. The sheriff told me.
gonna follow the blood trail.
wait for me, Pocahontas.
well, this fellow didn't come here to roast marshmallows.
blunt force trauma.
glass fragment cuts on the exposed skin.
seatbelt restraint contusions-- all consistent with a...
car accident.
stumbles in looking for help.
Yeah, well, he certainly need it.
however, what is strange is that these minor abrasions were tended to, whereas his most serious injuries were not.
this explains it.
these wounds are older.
they show signs of primary hemostasis.
first stages of scab formation.
Ah, it appears our deceased had an unfortunate accident before he had his unfortunate accident.
someone didn't know how to parallel park.
I have always found it hard to park when someone is shooting at you.
found the slug in the passenger headrest.
missed its target, huh?
got the job done.
talk to me.
well, it looks like Collins' car was shot at, boss.
several partial fingerprints on the driver's side window here.
time of crash?
well, the kids didn't hear any gunshots or the crash, so it must've been...
wasn't a question, DiNozzo.
the clock on the dash is broken.
right.
7: 22 p. m.
hour before the party started.
shoe print. The victim's?
that's not a Chuck.
Collins was wearing Chuck Taylor Converse All-Stars.
you know, basketball shoes. That's not a Chuck. Somebody else was here.
passenger? - Yeah.
or shooter.
this is getting like a Greek tragedy.
did you know that legend has it that in 456 B. C.
a vulture mistook a man's bald head for its prey and dropped a stone on it?
killed him instantly.
Yeah, the unfortunate fellow became known as...
the father of Greek tragedy.
I had no idea you were familiar with the classics, Jethro.
perhaps it's only the tragedies?
what do you got for me, Duck?
well, like Aeschylus, our petty officer's death is both tragic and unique.
he suffered two types of injury: those sustained in the car crash and those inflicted on him prior to it, see?
this fist-shaped bruise on his forehead, the gouges on his cheek by the broken jaw.
he was beaten.
savagely.
and he fought back as well.
see, the knuckles on his right hand are skinned raw.
however, Abby performed a DNA test on some skin fragments I found under Collins' fingernails.
presumably, they belong to his attacker.
our brilliant forensic scientist has now come up with something most interesting.
the same DNA on Collins' bandages.
same person.
the hands that pummeled the petty officer also bandaged his wounds.
whoever did this, Jethro, is both savage and a Samaritan.
Hey, McGee, do you have the crime scene photos? I need to cue them up for Gibbs.
Tony was supposed to upload them.
where is he?
big Wong's. It's his turn for takeout.
Sothisis air guitaring?
Yeah, you know, you, uh, pretend to play the guitar.
why not actually play the guitar?
well, because it is calledairguitaring?
right. I got that part.
I still do not understand...
Ziva, photos. Plasma.
there are two sets of tire tracks on the road near the crash.
based on the vectoring of the skids, both cars were traveling in the same direction.
bullet through the back window.
I smell road rage.
and I smell Big Wong.
Collins swerves, rolls down the embankment.
the other driver goes down looking for him.
finds a corpse and bails, hit-and-run.
shoot and run.
my God, Gibbs, I'm so sorry. I just...
shooter could have known Collins. Ran him off the road on purpose.
well, we'll know soon enough.
Abby's running the prints from the driver's side window through AFIS.
boss, I've been monitoring Collins' cell phone activity.
he just received a call. - From who?
home security service.
Collin's alarm is going off.
I see you like going through my photos, huh?
Yeah, I like reading.
Hemmingway, Dostoevsky-- guess what he wrote?
the Idiot.
clear.
clear inside.
but we got something.
found it in a laundry basket.
maybe the Laundromat was out of quarters.
looks like six,$700 there.
they forced the latch on the back door open.
forgot the money. - Gibbs.
blood's dry. At least a day old.
looks like the Tooth Fairy missed one.
a couple more here. Bag 'em.
Ah, damn. Neighbors.
come on.
I'm Bruce Solomon. I, uh, I live across the street.
I'm, uh, Adam Parker, the duplex with the English ivy.
we, uh, we heard the alarm. It's been going off for 46 minutes.
um, we did a quick patrol.
no signs of any suspicious activity.
let me guess, Neighborhood Watch.
Mm-hmm, is Greg okay?
petty Officer Collins is dead.
car accident, last night. - Oh, my God.
was it on Route Ten?
cause we've petioned the city for a turn lane there for a long time.
Collins was murdered. Run off the road.
you don't look surprised.
you have a lot of murders here on Wisteria Lane?
well, it's a, it's a very quiet area, but ever since Greg moved in...
not so quiet. There's music, parties... lots of drinking.
last week, it got completely out of hand. There was this whole gang of them.
and then a fight broke out, but nobody tried to break it up.
they were just standing around cheering. It was weird.
it reminded me of, um... - Tyler Durden.
Yeah, exactly. - Who?
ed Norton, Brad Pitt, Fight Club.
sorry, Ziva, we don't talk about fight club.
in your case, I'll make an exception for you, boss.
underground backyard brawls.
no rules, no gloves, no mercy.
there's a huge black market for underground fight videos.
it starts in the backyard...
ends on the back road.
no match on the partials from Collins' car.
and this is the best of them.
partials are a little tougher.
but that hasn't stopped me, nor will it ever, because I am the Energizer Bunny of forensic science.
I never sleep and I never give up.
help, I'm losing power.
shoe print.
we couldn't match it to any known brand.
even Tony didn't recognize it.
you know his shoe collection.
we think the shoe was custom-made.
and very pricey.
sweet. I heart the VODD.
virginia Offender DNA Databank.
Abby ran the DNA from Collins' bandages and hit the jackpot.
name?
patience, fearless leader, I'm just uploading the data right now.
and the winner is...
Sam Bennett. Civilian.
rap sheet includes petty theft, B and E, disorderly conduct.
doesn't appear to have a permanent address.
work?
well, shiver me timbers, looks like Bennett is part of a salvage crew on a ship.
navy frigate, boss. USSRubicon.
you know how a ship is decommissioned? - Yep.
first the military removes all the, uh, classified material
the, uh, electronics, weapons.
Yes. I know.
the hull of the ship is, uh, is striped for scrap.
and if a ship has a history, it may be turned into a maritime museum.
you guys the Navy cops?
Yeah, my seahorse is double-parked outside.
you ought to see the lights. We're here to talk to Sam Bennett.
not here. - Come again?
Bennett-- he's not on the ship.
are you the foreman that I spoke to earlier, said that Sam Bennett was here?
Yeah. Was.
he clocked in earlier today.
he's wanted in connection with a murder.
we're here to speak with him.
look, I can't find him, okay?
I had my crew look everywhere.
after I told him you were coming, he told the guys he was going out for a smoke.
he never came back.
do you know where he's staying?
I don't really ask a lot of questions.
you know, these-these salvage guys, they're not exactly...
employee of the Month material. We got it.
here you go. Sorry.
Bennett's on the run.
I need a BOLO. Sam Bennett. Caucasian male, 23.
go, McGee.
well, Bennett doesn't have a cell. No e-mail. No driver's license.
no living relatives. - Not even a library card.
no. Bennett. As in Tony.
he's gotta exist somewhere. Keep looking.
with an "S.
Sam? - Yeah.
as in Sam I am. Sam, play it again, Sam. Sam with an "S.
all right, got it. - Oh, my gosh.
he's 23, six foot, three, 210 pounds.
light brown hair, blue eyes, and a barbwire tattoo on his left bicep.
he was last seen...
standing right behind you, DiNozzo.
I love it when they turn themselves in.
you want to tell me about Greg?
stood by me when everyone else bailed.
taught me how to look out for something else besides just myself.
four-oh sailor.
he was my best friend.
I made a lot of mistakes.
and he-he turned my life around.
I owe him everything.
he got me the welding gig on the ship.
I'm-I'm good with my hands.
Greg's face said the same thing.
tell me about the fights.
not supposed to.
fight club. - Told you.
you should look into it sometime.
I'm sure you'd enjoy yourself.
I remember my first fight.
I was eight. Shmuel Rubinstein.
sounds like a real stud.
one punch and it was over.
what did poor Shmuel do to deserve the wrath of Ziva?
he said he liked me.
I keep my promises. He was my buddy.
your buddy's dead.
the locations move around a lot.
last week the fights went down at Greg's place.
he cleaned up, won some cash.
and the fights yesterday?
vacant lot in Chesapeake.
so you and, uh, Collins-- you fought each other.
we didn't want to, but we didn't have a choice.
the-the fights are random draw.
when it was over, I-I fixed him up as best I could.
then I killed him.
Oh, wait a minute, that was way too easy.
he didn't even get the Gibbs glare.
could be covering for someone. - ...with my own bare hands.
when my foreman told me that you guys were looking for me, I-I freaked out.
but I'm done running.
I owe it to Greg to do the right thing and to turn myself in.
you didn't kill him.
he's dead because of me.
you in the car with him?
no, his-his eyes were-were practically swollen shut from the fight.
I told him that it wasn't safe to drive.
he wouldn't listen.
I-I tried to stop him, and he just got in his car and he left.
well, 20 minutes later, somebody shot up his car.
what?
crash wasn't an accident.
wait, somebody killed him?
sit down.
who shot at him?
any fighters have a grudge?
I don't know. I-I don't know any of them.
Greg would just bring me in to make some extra dough when I was tight for cash.
names.
reaper, Wild Dog...
no, their real names.
I don't know their real names.
but when I find out who did this to Greg, they're gonna know mine.
and that is the last thing they're ever gonna know!
think one of those backyard brawlers whacked Collins?
well, I doubt they're the most stable kind of people.
big, hairy, sweaty Neanderthals pounding the pudding out of each other for giggles?
for green.
one of those fighters make a lot of money.
I'd pay to see the right bout.
like Leroy Jethro Gibbs versus...
Oh, McGee, I was thinking like Terminator.
which model? T-X? T-1000?
all of them. Gibbs terminates.
all right, how about Gibbs versus Godzilla.
king of the Monsters... toast.
Mothra.
wingless in a nanosecond.
come on, McGee, give me something fierce.
boss man's got mad skills. - All right.
Ooh, okay. Gibbs versus...
Oh, that's good.
okay, so, um, evil twin or a clone?
Gibbs! Good timing. I have something to show you.
okay, we found three layers of paint on the left rear quarter panel
silver and then brown, and then silver again over the original gold.
this is old-fashioned bumper cars.
by using the tire skids on the road, we were able to recreate the accident.
the first layer of paint is silver.
it came from the evil, mystery car. Bam!
it rams Collins' car. He swerves.
pumps the brakes, and he leaves this tire skid on the road.
then Collins' was shot at.
that's the, uh, bullet hole in the back window.
and there's two more slugs in the car.
so, uh, Collins hits the gas-- he burns rubber, and then fishtails into a barricade.
bam! A brown barricade!
the second layer of paint.
then another-- bam! as the evil car hits Collins' car one last time, sends him off the road and giving us the final layer of silver paint, and confirming its evilosity.
the silver base coat-- it contains three properties:
methyl ethyl ketone, xylene and titanium dioxide.
now, the first two are common solvents.
titanium dioxide, not so much.
so, we should be able to trace it. - Then do it.
Hey, boss. - Yes, McGee?
have you ever lost a fight?
not sure I even ever won one.
definitely a Gibbs clone.
I'm cross-referencing the paint against a database of automakers.
got a match here, Maserati Quattroporte, 2009.
need some serious coin to roll in one of those. - Find it.
several registered in the tristate area.
two belong to Muhammad Al-Qazir.
unfortunately, his are both Baltic Black Metallic.
Argenta Silver.
got it. Tabitha Summers.
looks rich. - Uh, is rich.
father died three years ago, left her the family's import business.
she's worth over 50 million. - Bring her in.
I'll send the limo.
you're on. - You owe me.
hello.
afternoon.
Dale Kapp, Mrs. Summers' personal attorney.
can we get this over with?
sure. This way, please.
that is what they call the eye of the cougar, probie.
isn't she married?
she's a t jungle cat. The cougar is always on the hunt.
it's the nature of the beast.
I always thought cougars like young guys.
this is extremely mortifying for my client.
and while she has nothing to hide, she certainly wouldn't want it implied in the press that she has anything to do with your ongoing investigation.
you recognize him?
no.
do you recognize this?
mm, my car. Or one of them.
it was involved in a hit-and-run accident last night.
but my husband and I were both in for the evening getting massages.
then we'll need to talk to your husband.
you are.
Dale is my current husband.
current?
right. Uh, husband number...
three.
four.
Dale handled my previous divorce.
mazel tov.
we never left our home.
car drove itself then?
look, we have a dozen house employees who could have possibly accessed the motor pool
cooks, gardeners, pool staff.
names?
and we need to see the car.
Oh, I'm sorry. It's being taken this afternoon to our home in Nantucket.
actually, it's going to the Hamptons cottage.
I thought I told you we're spending Christmas in Nantucket?
don't you ever listen?
still, we need to see the car.
I'll take care of it.
are we done with these people?
any other questions for my client?
need a DNA sample.
is my wife being charged, Agent Gibbs?
not yet.
then we're leaving. Thank you.
Oh, the old fingerprint-off-the-glass trick.
who needs DNA. - Abby?
you're right. I need DNA. It's my lifeblood.
okay, well, doesn't match the partial from the car.
it wasn't Tabitha.
I will start rounding up their house employees for questioning.
I thought you said her prints didn't match.
that's not from Tabitha's glass.
it's from her husband's, Dale Kapp.
get him back here.
he's probably already off the base by now.
I'll put out a BOLO.
cell phone.
I'm already triangulating for a signal, Gibbs.
you've got to be faster than that. Got him.
he's on the phone right now, and he's still on the base.
as a matter of fact, he is right in front of the building.
that's weird. Looks like he's driving into the lobby.
DiNozzo, front gate-- shut it down.
who are we stopping?
everyone, I guess.
this is Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.
we need to shut down the front gate. Lock it down.
Where's your husband?
I don't know. Spending his last few hours as a married man?
he went to get the car, and then just drove off. Left me.
first Bennett runs, and now Kapp.
maybe the only thing Kapp's running from is his wife.
dangerous.
you know how fast a cougar can run?
not fast enough. She could not catch his car.
Kapp must have known we were closing in.
he's running for a reason.
but she has no idea why.
says she has never heard of Collins.
well, Kapp obviously has.
Oh, hey, boss. We got his laptop. It's down with Abby.
spoke with the Summers' masseuse.
Kapp cancelled his shiatsu.
when he was supposedly at home, a traffic camera a mile away shows him running a red light in the Maserati.
it time-stamped yesterday, 7:16 p. m.
six minutes before Collins was run off the road.
that's gonna be 400 bucks for a traffic violation, and 50 years for murder.
motive?
motive. There's a question.
we cross-referenced Kapp and Collins' cell phone records and credit cards.
we got nothing.
no apparent connection.
Collins' C. O?
never heard of Kapp. Neither have any of Collins' shipmates.
gold-digging, society lawyer and a squid who spends his spare time beating guys to a pulp.
next, on an all-newMaury.
Yeah, Abs. - Gibbs, can you come to the lab?
Mm-hmm, be right down. McGee. Find him.
I'm checking to see if there's any hits on the BOLO.
still nothing.
but my current rank in the air guitar competition is up with a bullet to second.
Oh, you must be so proud.
you're jealous. - Because you can air guitar?
because you can't.
Tony, I've told you. I like to have fun in more...
adult ways.
reading. - Yes. Reading.
look, everybody enjoys a good book, but don't you ever have the urge to just act a little...
childish?
silly. Stupid. Brainless.
like you? - Exactly.
Tony, you anI come from two totally different places.
in my world, you grow up... fast.
you have no choice. - Now you do.
I found a series of encrypted files in a hidden partition in Kapp's computer.
a lot of e-mails and chat room conversations.
over 20 in the last month, all from the same screen name.
J-Digg19. - Plasma.
decrypt it.
uh, we already did, boss. It's...
well, you know, it's a chat room.
it's IM-speak.
you wouldn't know.
it starts off with,"Hey, how are you today?" "Fine, thank you.
gets interesting further down.
he wants to know what she's wearing.
says he wants to take her shopping for lingerie.
then he says... - Yeah. Yeah, McGee, I get the picture.
who is she? - Not his wife.
there's an embedded hyperlink.
he's chatting with a Jodi, and here's her MySpace page.
blink, McGee. It's just a girl.
what? I'm just... - Gawking?
uh, no. Pinging.
boss, by pinging the site's DNS cache, we can see what computer last logged in to Jodi's page.
and get the IP address, which is registered to...
205 Wilcox.
going by yourself, boss? Need, uh, backup?
reminds me of my first apartment in college.
you can almost smell the Ikea.
come on in! Door's open.
I'll be right there. Grab a drink if you want.
think she was expecting someone.
want a drink? Just kidding.
federal agents. We need to talk with you.
did I mention my roommate went home for the weekend?
nice timing, huh?
we're federal agents. We'd like to ask you a few questions, ma'am.
you know what? I got an idea.
why don't you strip down and jump in the shower with me?
Hey, DiNozzo! - No, it's not what you think. Check it out, boss.
lipstick camera.
Oh, we're being watched.
there's another one.
federal agents. We're coming in.
peekaboo.
you see, things are not what they seem.
Jodi's voice was precorded.
maybe it's one of those voice-activated, motion-activated, sensor thing-a-ma-jobs.
you know, gets her talking.
Where's McGeek when you need him?
Oh, I got another one.
it's getting kind of lonely in here.
how long you gonna keep me waiting?
careful, boss, it might be rigged.
or not.
like a sort of a computer storage megagiga thingy.
we're not being watched.
we're being recorded.
it's kind of like that TV show, To Catch a Predator.
Yeah. Only, this is more like To Catch a Sucka.
here's how the scam works.
Jodi hangs out in chat rooms, looking for unhappily married men.
unfortunately, when the men show up, there is no Jodi.
just video cameras. - Yup. Recording everything.
then the mark gets e-mailed a threat, saying if they want that videotape to disappear, they got to pay.
ten Gs.
I'm trying to find the owner of the Web site now.
lot of cash for Joe Blow.
blackmailer isn't targeting Joe Blow.
no. He is targeting men with rich wives.
Suckas like this guy.
if he gets naked, I'm out of here.
video footage on this server going back almost two years.
well, wherever Jodi is, she's making a killing.
Oh, she isn't anywhere. She doesn't exist.
I ran facial-recognition software on Jodi.
I traced the face back to a modeling Web site in the Ukraine.
the image was stolen.
so, who's the man behind the shower curtain?
and we have a winner. The e-mail account is registered to...
petty Officer Collins.
got our motive.
Kapp didn't want to pay, and killed Collins.
bolo came back on Kapp's Town Car.
it is parked outside Collins' house.
Kapp's ride.
why did he come here?
probably looking for any backup copies Collins had of the incriminating footage.
hood's still warm.
boss, I got the front.
looks like we missed another fight.
somebody just murdered our murder.
our man has been murdered, our killer killed.
Kapp capped.
he has a possible fractured skull.
and there's multiple contusions to his head.
beaten to death?
the usual disclaimer until I do a thorough examination.
fists?
something harder.
with an edge.
boss.
like a length of wood.
got a witness, boss.
there was someone here today after lunch.
one of Collins' friends: big guy with fair hair.
I got a really good look at him.
got a BOLO out in every homeless shelter in Norfolk, boss.
coordinate with Norfolk PD.
already done.
Bennett must have known something we didn't.
found out Kapp was the killer.
he did say he would get payback.
and he did. Beat Kapp to a pulp with a 2x4 after we released him.
where is he going?
well, doesn't have any family. No money.
bolo doesn't come back soon, he's gonna disappear.
you need to unplug yourself from the Matrix, do some old-school sleuthing, Pinkerton.
it's all about asking the right question.
well, ask away, DiNozzo.
why did Kapp rabbit out of here, leaving his wife behind?
why did he go straight to Collins' house?
and how did Bennett know to find him there?
he didn't find him. He lured him.
easy enough-- all Bennett had to do was phone Kapp, tell him he had a couple of photos of him showing up to Jodi's apartment.
running Kapp's cell phone records.
there.
got a call after he left us and dumped his wife.
tracing the call.
came from Collins' house. Bennett must have been there.
left before we arrived.
got it. Collins' phone records.
five calls to his house from a pay phone located at...
WESTERN Dock.
where the USSRubicon is being decommissioned.
gear up.
how's that for old-school slothing?
Sleuthing-- having fun yet?
no one home.
salvage guys have called it a day.
Hey, keep it down.
sorry.
lost the lights.
knows we're here.
found Bennett's crash pad, boss.
why does it always have to be rats and boats?
McGee, heading your way.
federal agent-- stay where you are.
boss, C-deck, heading towards the bow.
status, McGee.
anybody got eyes on McGee?
negative.
no sign of him, boss.
got him.
way to go, McGee.
taking down the fight club champ. I'm almost impressed.
well, I would be, too, except he fell over and hit his head while he was trying to get away.
you killed him. You killed Kapp.
no.
you beat him to death with a lump of wood, not your fists.
no.
perhaps not the fighter you think you are.
it wasn't me. It wasn't.
McGee, I'm busy.
if I find anything, you will be the second to know.
I'm up to my choker collar in dried blood and partial fingerprints and wood splinters.
Gibbs wants anything I can find to pressure Bennett.
then, why are you running a WHO-IS search?
I found some anomalies in the extortion e-mails Kapp received.
I'm trying to track down the source of a header mismatch.
McGee. I got a ding.
now, that's a ding.
that's not a ding. That's a leech.
I told you, it wasn't me. - Boss...
you told Agent Gibbs you would kill whoever was responsible for Petty Officer Collins' death.
when you found out it was Kapp, you called him from Collins' house.
I wasn't at the house.
cut.
what?
Rhiannon. - What was wrong with that?
I'm gonna need a real scream.
that was a scream.
no, no, no, no. An ber-scream, okay?
think of Halloween II on steroids, okay?
you want to take a break? - Yeah.
should have gone with the blonde. - No. You know, this is a favor.
he should be happy I'm even here.
I-I've screamed in threerealmovies.
I mean, if there's one thing I can do, it's...
lame.
see, now that was a real scream.
Rhiannon? - Help. Help.
help! Help! Gary, get me out of here.
she was not smiling at you, Tony.
Ziva, some men can hit a baseball 400 feet, others build rocket ships that sail to the stars.
I can spot a woman's smile at 20 yards.
her name is Hannah, and she's asked me out to lunch twice.
you?
did your rocket ship just take a nose dive?
no. It just landed on a different planet.
look, two days ago, you told me my car would be ready yesterday, and the bill was $270.
then yesterday, you told me my car would ready today, and the bill was $400.
now you're telling me my car's gonna be ready tomorrow?
Absolutely. Tomorrow. - How much?
one octave or two? - Two.
$600?
okay, I understand, but... - It's got to be replaced.
tomorrow? - Yes, sir.
okay then. Thank you.
my crankshaft is wearing out.
there is no question what's going on involves you and a shaft, McSofty.
well, Tony, sometimes it's not always the best policy to be too tough.
it can end up costing you more in the long run.
I'm guessing that you got more than your fair share of wedgies as a kid.
I can be tough when I have to be.
what? - Nothing.
I mean, you do have your... strengths.
and weaknesses.
but, rember that people can be loved as much for their weaknesses as they are for their strengths.
well, then, DiNozzo, you must be one very well-loved man.
thank you for noticing, boss.
squid. Long dead. Let's go.
Hey, Ziva?
did you accept?
lunch? Hannah?
coming through.
take it easy, McCranky.
you never cease to amaze me, Jethro.
you find the most dastardly crimes in the most idyllic of settings.
lieutenant Neal Poletto.
get anything? - Yeah.
an offer to be tech advisor on his next film.
it's about a psycho, sex-crazed cop.
life and times of Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo?
cuts all around the upper torso.
he's been stabbed multiple times.
and he's missing a middle finger.
it appears to have been sawn off.
the other hand, too, Duck.
anything else you'd care to tell me about this fellow, Jethro?
dead 11 years.
And? - And I know who did it.
Celia Roberts. - A looker.
no, a hooker.
convicted of killing two sailors.
by our very own Leroy Jethro Gibbs.
before our time.
both men had multiple stab wounds.
both men had their middle fingers cut off.
why the middle finger?
maybe she was giving them the finger.
Man-hater. - You would know, Ziva.
she was suspected in the disappearance and murder of Lieutenant Neal Poletto.
but since his body was never found, she was only prosecuted for the other two murders.
she was sentenced to 175 years in the Maryland State Prison for Women.
I hear the first hundred years are the hardest.
well, Abby has confirmed that the knife that killed Lieutenant Poletto is the same one that Celia Roberts used on her first two victims.
open and shut.
well, DiNozzo, it'd be easier for everyone if we just get her to admit it.
I will get a confession. - Why you?
because I am a woman.
and women open up to other women.
you mean, like Hannah... and Her Sisters. Come on.
after 11 years in the joint, all ladies, she might welcome a little change of pace.
you mean a man.
a virile man could be just the thing to loosen her lips.
Oh, you mean Gibbs. - I mean me.
not that you're not virile. You are, 'cause you're the boss.
who's the boss?
you don't... Those... Those don't go in there.
McGee. Get her signed confession.
first thing tomorrow morning. Don't come back without it.
you got it, boss.
what?
it's just, you got to have the stuff, be tough, know when to bluff.
so, I have to be a really bad poet?
I call my style tough-bluff.
it's hyphenated. - Really?
blowhard actually seems more appropriate. That is not hyphenated.
you're going to convince a woman to confess to a crime?
Yeah. So?
when's the last time you convinced a woman to do anything, McGee?
just last week, McGee convinced me to lend him ten dollars.
ten dollars. Murder one.
my last ten dollars.
when you asked me, I was determined to say no.
but there was something in the way you asked.
before I knew it, I was opening up my wallet. - Really?
there's no doubt in my mind you will get that confession, McGee.
thank you, Ziva.
he's toast, isn't he?
Oh, yes. Burnt toast.
the following inmates are to report to Facility B...
report to Facility B medical line immediately.
this way, sir.
morning.
I put Celia Roberts in our Attorney Room in back to give you guys some more privacy.
great. Thanks. - Through here.
Brenda Carter. - Yeah.
I have not seen you since, oh, what, graduation night at FLETC?
Yeah. I remember it well.
Oh, those were your shoes that I...
italian shoes.
Jamaican rum. - Empty stomach.
so, I see you left the federal system.
Yeah. You know, better pay, closer to home, so...
well, uh, official visit for me. I'm here to see Celia Roberts.
Oh, well, good luck with that.
Celia's a real piece of work.
most of 'em are.
so, um, where are you stationed?
navy Yard.
well, I'm here. Obviously.
well, we should, uh, you know, get together and catch up, have a drink sometime.
sounds great. Sounds great. Will you call me? Or I'll call you.
you know, whatever works, right? So, okay?
okay. - Okay.
okay. - Okay.
okay.
Bye.
Vicari, you flash your boyfriend one more time, you lose visiting privileges.
hello.
I'm Special Agent Timothy McGee. Thank you for seeing me.
have a choice?
two photos. Same guy.
lieutenant Neal Poletto.
he looks better in this one.
before and after shots.
this one is after he was stabbed 23 times and had both his middle fingers cut off.
looks like he's aged a bit, too.
about 11 years.
guess that's why you're here.
you killed two other men the same way with the same weapon.
yours.
it would be nice for the Poletto family to have some closure.
stop looking at him! Why don't you shut up, Vicari?
settle down now. - You want to go?
now! Get in! I'm not gonna tell you again...
you were convicted in Maryland.
Poletto's body was found in Virginia.
you know why that's bad for you?
death penalty.
virginia is very big on it.
confess, and this stays a federal case, meaning no conviction until after you've served your current sentence.
meaning never.
otherwise, I hand this to the authorities in Virginia.
way back. Way back...
I don't like needles.
your choice.
I don't believe you.
what is that? - Damn.
everything okay out there?
come on.
McGee is out, Abby.
Oh, yeah, I know. He's slumming at the prison.
we were supposed to have lunch.
I'm just returning his computer game.
uh, frankly, I do not understand the fascination with, uh, electronic games.
it shortens attention span, curbs productivity, and it kills brain cells.
enough with the long sentences.
who can follow all that?
take a look at this.
this is McGee before he tries to break the hooker from hell.
and this is him after she gets into his head.
how about a picture of you actually working, DiNozzo?
um, I'm working on... on that.
Yeah, Gibbs. Yeah.
maryland Women's Prison.
let's go.
wait. That's where McGee is. Is everything okay?
everything's not okay. What's happened? Gibbs!
Abby... I'll call you, all right?
they just started whaling on me.
they started it. - What do we do?
but we finished it. - No, we didn't finish anything.
this is bad. They're not organized.
I just defended myself. - What happened?
Trimble came in, bleeding like a stuck pig.
stay put! You stay back with the others.
who did it? - I didn't see anything.
by the time I saw him, he was already on the ground.
it could have been anybody. - Somebody must have seen something.
how are you doing?
I think my arm's busted.
what happened?
one minute, everything's fine.
the next, I saw Trimble stumble in bleeding, then he want down.
and they all just cut loose.
we tried to restore order, but...
anyone see what happened to Trimble?
you may not care about your family, but I do
we got to get our families out of here.
I say that we give up before it's too late.
that's a good idea.
who's he? - A cop.
all right, they rush us, you are the first to die.
I'm not a cop; I'm an NCIS agent.
just as dead.
look, I got one year left.
I just want to do my time, okay?
they're gonna blame all of us for killing Trimble.
it doesn't matter how much time you got left.
we're all gonna suffer.
Angela's right. We're gonna have to protect ourselves.
there are two points of entry and an air duct.
now, will an air duct support a man's weight?
come on, people. We need to know this! Now, get on it.
who's in charge here?
gene Halsey, warden.
Gibbs, NCIS. We've got an agent here. Where is he?
visitor center. Inmates have control of it.
he is alive? - Don't know. The cameras are out.
you plan to retake this by force?
if they don't get out of there real soon.
till then, I have this entire prison on lockdown.
and the hostages?
this prison has a no-hostage policy, meaning every man, woman and child who comes in those gates gives up their right to be rescued.
but believe me, I'm gonna do everything I can to minimize casualties.
I got men in there, too.
now, I'm kind of busy.
you have much experience in hostage recovery?
I have an emergency response plan. - Okay.
have you ever put it into action?
take that as a no.
the one on the left... what's she in for?
armed robbery, kidnapping and murder.
what about the one next to her?
Sharon Bellows-- she killed her boyfriend.
claims he put her in the hospital a few times.
she called it self-defense. Judge called it manslaughter.
Judy Williams killed her 80-year-old neighbor for her meds.
Kayla Vicari. Manufacturing meth.
they want to send out an ear or a finger to show we're serious.
that's crazy.
she's right.
shouldn't be a guard. That will really piss them off.
he screams, cut his throat.
I can't watch. - Wait, wait, wait, wait.
you choose.
this is a bad idea. - You got a better one?
I got a bad feeling about Bozo and his three-ring circus.
can we go over his head?
it's his ball.
inmate using a confiscated radio says they want to make some demands.
want to show me they're serious.
show you? - One of them's coming out.
this is not your jurisdiction, Agent Gibbs.
how often do you do this sort of thing?
open up.
I do the talking, you got that?
gonna find out who's calling the shots here.
they let you go? - Not exactly.
I'm the negotiator.
you're the negotiator?
I sort of talked them into it.
all right, what's the situation?
actually, I've been told I can only deal directly with my boss, Special Agent Gibbs.
they're watching us right now.
situation, McGee.
guards handcuffed in the southwest corner.
inmates spread all over, armed with batons and shards of glass.
casualties?
there's one dead. A guard, Hayden Trimble.
but he wasn't killed in the riot.
looks like it's his death that caused it.
another guard injured, Gordon Lambro.
what happened?
Trimble was stabbed.
the guards tried to restore order. Inmates responded.
what do they want?
assurance that only Trimble's killer will be punished, and amnesty for injuries to the other guards.
they are gonna hand over Trimble's killer?
once we find out who did it.
that's where I... you... we come in.
they want NCIS to figure out who Trimble's killer is.
which brings me to their last condition.
no attempts to retake the visitor center.
if we agree, they'll release Trimble's body, the injured guard and the visitors.
that will leave myself and two other guards as hostages.
get the doors.
this way. Come on, folks. Come on.
move, move!
through the gate-- keep moving.
move. Get them on the buses.
right this way. - Move them out. There we go.
quickly!
head count. 22 in, 22 out.
okay.
for this to work, I'm gonna need everyone's cooperation and trust.
trust a cop-- that's easier said than done.
uh, believe me, it's no harder than me trusting a convicted felon.
now, first thing...
we have to find a murder weapon, so I am going to have to frisk you.
frisk who? - All of you.
who wants to go first?
so much for cooperation.
first murder, then a riot?
and we have to solve the murder.
Yeah, but it happened in a prison, which we're not allowed into.
Ducky gets here, I'm going in.
if you get the chance.
agent Gibbs.
our guys are here.
inmates are spread throughout, which means we got to move when they're grouped together.
if my team figures this out, everybody walks out of here.
as long as this lasts, my prison population feels empowered.
one way or the other, this ends at sundown.
means...
you have seven hours to end this, or I will.
Trimble have enemies? - You could say that.
heroin's been pouring in.
Trimble was my lead investigator.
we were trying to turn off the spigot.
reason enough right there to try to kill him.
start with Trimble.
Ziva. - McGee is fine, Abby.
never thought I'd get the chance to do this to you, Mr. Gibbs.
me, neither, Celia.
don't do anything stupid.
same applies to you, Lopez.
I once sewed up the arm of a lion tamer, and he said the worst thing you can do is to let your felines feel cornered, scared, or threatened.
you mean like this, Duck?
nothing happens to him. You hear me?
or what?
or you'll wish you'd been sentenced to death, not life.
Oh, okay, you guys mess with this dude, you mess with Brenda-- good to know.
from what I can tell, this is where he fell.
the body hasn't been moved.
single stab wound to the chest. He bled out.
and slowly.
can't find the murder weapon.
given the circumstances, can't secure the crime scene.
keep looking.
he has a head wound.
it could have rendered him unconscious.
I followed the blood trail out this way.
Thanks.
in here.
this is the guards' bathroom, off limits to the prisoners.
he was stabbed in here.
that's where his head was slammed against the wall.
seat's down.
guess he wasn't here to use it.
figure he had company.
you think, Sherlock?
women's prison-- it happens.
shoot, even happens in men's prisons.
look, for this to work, we really need to treat everyone as suspects.
so please, just let us do this.
they're coming in before sundown.
boss, that doesn't give us enough time to...
McGee. S. O.P. for inmates to use the head.
guard inside the visitor center let them out here into the corridor where Trimble was keeping watch.
Trimble was supposed to notify the other guards if he needs to use the bathroom; he never did.
probably 'cause he was doing something he shouldn't have.
cost him his life. Cameras?
only in the visitor center. - Blood evidence.
most of the inmates and guards have blood on them; I'm sure some of it's Trimble's, but...
doesn't single out anybody.
need to find his killer.
Yeah, in a room full of them.
they haven't hurt McGee, have they?
we have not heard anything.
got something for you from Trimble's apartment, Abby.
we need to figure this out before sunset.
define "before sunset.
before the sun goes down.
Ethan Hawke movie with Julie...
what was that for?
the sun sets at around 5: 02.
so does that mean we have until 5: 01?
before sunset. - That could mean now.
not good enough. I can't take this.
every day you guys go out and I never know if you're going to make it back.
it's killing me. I can't sleep at night.
I'm developing some sort of weird twitch.
our work is sometimes dangerous, Abby.
then get a safer job.
then you wouldn't see us at all.
true. Still... sucks.
fingerprints, hard drive... bedsheets.
evidence of extracurricular activities.
McGee's going to be okay, right?
you kidding? Stuck in a women's prison. It's every guy's fantasy.
well, maybe not McGee.
here. What's that?
check there.
look, can you... can you please just all just give me some room here?
it's very difficult looking for this murder weapon with everyone in my way here, so...
come on, y'all.
thank you.
when's the food's coming? - Soon.
pizza?
Yeah, maybe.
Hey, you like pizza? - Yeah...
pepperoni. You?
Yeah, pepperoni's good.
this sort of thing happen much?
never in my 15 years here.
you've known Celia since she's been in here? - Yeah.
she ever talk about what she did?
just to blame the system.
you seem to have taken responsibility for your crimes.
it's a mixed blessing.
first few years here, I was angry at everybody.
blamed the world for my crappy childhood.
then I got into a prison program training seeing-eye dogs...
one day I'm training this puppy and it hits me.
I killed an innocent person who didn't do me no harm.
now I can't wait till the day I die, so I can find that soul and apologize for the terrible thing I did.
look, I don't know if Celia did the things they say.
and if she did, I don't know what it'll take for her to face up to it.
Yeah, Abs?
how's McGee?
well, he's fine. What do you got?
define "fine.
he needs us to do our job before sundown.
okay, Ducky found calcium oxalate crystals in the dead guard's kidneys.
well, that's a huge red flag.
so I ran a special tox screen and, sure enough, it turned up.
what? - Ethylene glycol.
antifreeze.
Yeah, someone was poisoning him, Gibbs.
he died from the stab wound, but with the levels of ethylene glycol in Trimble's system, he was a dead man walking anyways.
none of the sitors or the injured guard saw Trimble get stabbed, Boss.
the DEA is cross-checking all inmates with links to known drug dealers.
I got a feeling that's going to be a long list.
they're checking prison employees, as well.
security footage.
got it right here, boss. - And?
I'll be like your closed captioning.
my what? - I'll talk. You listen.
by my count, six inmates entered the restroom corridor during visiting hours.
then we get Trimble.
he enters, obviously hurt.
guard hurries to him. Inmate lookie-loos hover.
push. Shove.
out comes the baton.
then static.
static? - Static.
we got the PG version. The Warden Halsey cut.
maybe he did not want to show how physical his guards got.
or he has something else to hide.
DiNozzo, give McGee the names of all the women who used the head.
done, boss.
I checked Trimble's phone records, Gibbs.
one person called him over 150 times last month.
it was another prison guard by the name of... Brenda Carter.
five calls a day.
I'd give her an eight on the DiNozzo Psycho Chick Meter.
ten being Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction.
look at those eyes, crazy eyes.
I'll send her over. - Got it.
crazy eyes.
I don't know why we couldn't have done this at the prison.
this could go down at any time.
we want to stop it from "going down," as you say.
okay, so you need to know about these women, right?
actually, I'd prefer to know more about Hayden Trimble.
okay.
you knew him well?
Yeah, sure. We worked together.
come on.
it was more than just a working relationship, was it not?
we dated.
when did he break up with you?
we broke up last month. But it was mutual.
and since then, you have called him more than 150 times and he has not called you back even once.
does not sound very mutual to me.
on our third date, he said he loved me.
I didn't have to say it first.
but you said it last.
men can be jerks. I know.
you think that I...
no, I was out of the building when he was killed.
were you?
did you know that someone was poisoning him?
okay, look, I-I might've thought about wringing his neck, but I didn't kill him.
Trimble was investigating drug smuggling into the prison.
he was avoiding me the last month.
I thought he was seeing another woman.
I left him a bunch of nasty messages.
drug investigation?
according to Warden Halsey.
what?
it's probably nothing.
but drug screening is mandatory for all employees.
so?
so I'm friends with the warden's assistant.
she told me that the warden missed his last mandatory drug screening.
and he faked the one before that.
what?
my experience, whenever a cop wants to talk in an interview room, nothing good comes of it.
look a bit jittery.
coming down with something. Mind your business.
right now, my business is investigating this crime.
and we believe that Trimble's murder could be drug-related.
and it looks like you're going through some withdrawal.
Really? - Really.
I don't like your tone.
shut it down. - It's my prison, Agent Gibbs.
not for long.
you pee in a cup lately?
I'm taking medication for a heart condition.
prison Board might think I can't handle the stress.
faking a drug test is a firing offense.
you shut it down. Now!
you blackmailing me?
I'm negotiating. You said sundown.
I said before sundown.
now you have less than two hours.
after that, I'll take my chance with the Prison Board.
heating. Lights.
great.
what's going on? - What's going on?
that's it. I'm finished. I'm done, all right?
you want to know who killed Trimble, figure it out yourselves.
see what you did?
maybe you'd think differently if I took your ear.
I've never hit a woman before, but if you come at me with that thing, I will drop you.
I got just one year left. I got three kids to raise, please?
they come in here shooting, you're in the firing line, same as us.
shoot me up. Slice me up. It doesn't matter, okay?
because I'm done.
I'm done unless you tell me the name of your supplier.
now! - Lambro.
the guard you let out.
inmates gave you up.
women and secrets make a bad combination.
what secrets? - You're a dealer.
you believe them? - Prison guard as an inmate.
I hear they make you prom queen.
and every night is prom night.
you talk now and we'll make sure you're not put in with the general population.
they make some crazy accusations and you believe them?
I believe this.
found it in your SUV. - Must be a plant.
I got no time for this, Lambro!
now you've made him angry.
Trimble was onto your operation.
no... no. - First you poisoned him.
then you stabbed him. - No, you've got this so freaking wrong!
I was dealing, but I didn't kill him.
Trimble wasn't trying to bring down the drug operation. He was the head of it.
thank you.
DEA says Trimble's stepbrother is a known drug dealer.
could be Trimble's drug source.
supports Lambro's story that Trimble headed the operation.
doesn't get Lambro off the hook.
well, maybe Lambro wanted to take over the operation.
maybe he has a different supply source.
where does that leave us?
with a lot of maybes. Yeah. Gibbs.
can you come to the lab? - I'll be right there.
what are you doing?
tapping into Trimble's e-mail account on the prison network.
and they call us criminals.
what?
you are a criminal, Celia.
you don't know me.
what do you got, Abby?
okay, I might have overstepped my bounds here a little bit.
I-I know I'm not a field agent. - Abs.
I called the prison and I got Lambro's work schedule.
okay, because?
because I wanted to compare Lambro's schedule to when the antifreeze showed up in Trimble's system.
I also got the urine from Trimble's last drug test.
he was clean for illegal drugs, but I was able to figure out when he ingested the antifreeze.
24 hours before the test, Lambro was at a conference in Pennsylvania for a whole week, so it couldn't have been him.
Oh, by the way, if they ask you at the prison, I'm your boss.
wait, Gibbs, there's more.
I analyzed Trimble's bedsheets.
there is no direct match to anyone at the prison.
direct match? - Exactly.
that's where it gets interesting.
the DNA on Trimble's bedsheets belongs to a relative of a current inmate.
Zoe Bellows. Mother is Sharon Bellows.
sentenced to ten years for killing her boyfriend.
she claimed he was abusive and had some medical history to back it up.
one year left on her sentence.
the daughter.
she was not at the visitor center when Trimble died.
sun goes down in 63 minutes, boss. - Bring the girl in.
find me a paper trail.
how you doing? - Okay.
you know this man? - No.
we found your DNA on his bed.
where is he? - Dead.
first time he saw me, I was visiting my mom.
the way he was looking at me just gave me the creeps.
and then he found out where I went to school.
and then one day he was waiting for me.
he said he would hurt her if I... if I didn't...
you know.
he said his friends would kill my mom if I told on him.
the first time he did it, I was so disgusted, I threw up.
then he started shooting me up.
between my toes.
you tell your mother? - No.
so you took matters into your own hands?
I just wanted him to stop...
and he just wouldn't.
spiking his drinks with antifreeze?
I killed him.
no, you didn't.
but you, you said he was dead.
the car. Now. - On it. Okay.
several of the inmates here have identified the girl in that photo as your daughter.
how did you find out that she and Trimble were having a relationship?
you saw that photo. She didn't want to be there.
he was e-mailing it around to the other guards. - What?
did one of them show you? Or did Trimble?
Sharon, you found out about it and you killed him.
one year-- that's all I have left.
had left.
I have two other daughters. They're ten and they're 12.
at least I could still be a good mother to them.
not anymore, honey.
they're my babies.
they're bringing dinner. On carts.
call 'em back.
it's too late, Agent Gibbs.
I said call 'em back!
Sharon, if they come through that door, people are going to get hurt.
you're going to get us all killed, Bellows.
come on, Sharon.
please. Please.
they stopped. They're not bringing in the food.
I really don't think they got any.
Yeah. - Zoe Bellows.
already on it, boss.
two minutes, McGee. - Got to go.
where is she?
tell the warden he can have Trimble's killer.
sometimes this job sucks.
Sharon Bellows was in for killing an abusive boyfriend.
and while she's inside, her daughter's being abused. Trimble was scum.
makes no difference in the eyes of the law.
hence the word "sucks.
Yeah. - On my way out.
okay.
my agent's coming out.
stand by.
where is she? - Saying good-bye.
you okay, McGee? - Yeah.
did any of them hurt you, McGee?
I will kick their ass.
I'm fine, Ziva.
she's coming out. - Door's opening.
that's not who I was expecting to see, boss.
that's your murder weapon.
I killed Trimble.
they're ready to give up. - Move in.
let's go. - Move. Go.
don't hurt them.
Trimble was raping Sharon Bellows' daughter.
and smuggling drugs.
was Sharon in on it?
no, all my own work.
Sharon didn't want a part of it.
just wants to get out and be a mom again.
that sailor you were asking me about.
lieutenant Poletto.
I killed him, too.
sorry I did.
that a confession?
I'll write it all down for you.
do any of us really believe that Celia killed Trimble?
I don't think anyone is going to lose any sleep over it.
you write it up, Tim.
McGee, you're home.
good to see you, too, Abs.
we had total confidence in you, McGee.
obviously.
well, maybe just a moment of doubt.
you told me my car would be ready today.
one octave or two?
listen up because this is what you're going to do.
you're going to take the first estimate and you're going to reduce it by ten percent.
then, you're going to find my part, install the part, and have my car parked out front and ready for me when I walk out of this building in 32 minutes.
who would guess that McGee would grow a pair in a women's prison?
I put away killers for a living. That's what I do.
now, you do exactly as I told you and we won't have any problems. Understood?
good. Clock's ticking.
wow, McGee.
your time in the Big House really changed you.
I like it.
sir, you find your friend?
Yes, I did, thanks.
checking out.
name, sir?
special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.
good morning, Tony.
no.
I haven't seen that bad boy in a while.
you had a rough night?
Yes. - Yes, the people from Tokyo.
a few of our counterparts were visiting from Japan; Director Vance had Tony show them around.
sake bombs.
I see.
I barely made it out of there alive.
and now you hope to finish the job.
McGee, say words.
what you see before you, Ziva, is The DiNozzo Defibrillator.
it's been passed down through six generations.
my family also has a hangover remedy-- jasmine tea with lime.
that's disgusting.
remind me never to have a hangover in Israel.
not that I have a hangover now, boss.
you know I would never drink on a school night.
where were you last night?
drinking.
you alone?
of course not.
not that there's anything wrong with drinking bourbon alone in your basement... with a boat.
what were we talking about?
your alibi.
my alibi? For what?
who would want to impersonate Tony?
perhaps Jack Nicholson.
you know, impersonation revenge.
or it's a frame-up.
overseas. Maybe it was Trent Kort.
are you detecting a trend here?
Tony does have a way with people.
the seam split. I can't believe it.
I know. Discarded like a piece of trash.
no, I meant the duffel bag. I just bought the same one.
should have listened to the reviews-- they said the seams were a problem.
McGee, the man is folded in half.
I know. No, that... it... that's, uh, you know, a shame, too.
maybe I've been doing this too long.
well, that's my name. It's not my signature, but that's my name.
and to think, I almost made it an entire year without being accused of murder.
the guy did look a lot like you.
not helping.
was a little more fit, though.
we're gonna need... - Security tapes.
and... - Key to Room 742. Here you go.
in a bit of a rush?
actually, yes; I'd like to move this off the floor.
the Rosewood has a reputation to uphold.
if there's anything else you need, please let me know.
Yeah. We will.
come on.
funny, when I woke up this morning, those last four shots seemed like a bad idea.
don't need an alibi with me, DiNozzo.
I'm glad you got one, though.
makes two of us.
haven't seen anything quite like this since Vegas,'99.
Cirque du Soleil.
uh, Mother and I caught two shows in one evening.
she's an admirer, to say the least.
aren't we all?
not like my mother.
she had an infatuation for one of the tumblers for quite some time.
marc or Ignacio?
Yeah, I-I've followed Ignacio's career for some time, and he was...
why don't you quit while you're behind, Palmer?
quitting, sir. I will go get the gurney.
victim's Lieutenant Justin Grady.
works out of the Department of Defense.
you know him?
sounds familiar.
now that you mention it, he kind of looks familiar.
what did he do?
currently stationed as an Adjunct Supervisor in DoD's International Mail Gateway.
so he's a mailman?
was a mailman.
you got a cause of death, Duck?
this cyanosis indicates lack of oxygen.
that, combined with this ligature mark...
strangled? - Yeah. With a wire or cord.
and then...
to finish him off, they stabbed him through the heart.
preliminary measurement shows a three- to four-inch blade.
nothing in the alley.
room is clear, too.
well, you would know. It is your room.
way to kick a man when he's down, McBackstabber.
Ziva, witnesses? - Two.
a maid and a businessman who was rather inebriated.
they both got clear looks at the occupant of the room.
matches Tony's description.
okay, that's it. I'm out of here.
maybe we should go easy on him.
think he'd go easy on us?
excellent point.
remember me?
civilian. Worked out of the Pentagon.
my first collar as boss, three years ago, when you took your Mexican sabbatical.
intermission?
it was a hiatus really.
embezzlement.
right.
Renny was accused of stealing over a million bucks from a Navy credit union.
got a witness to testify against him.
open-and-shut case.
sort of.
well, the only thing is, we never ...
found the money. - found the money.
Nah, not so open and shut.
not really. - No.
that happens sometimes.
to the rest of us.
judge sentenced Renny to five years.
got supervised release three months ago.
and that coworker who testified...
lieutenant Justin Grady.
Yeah. Our dead guy.
well, nothing like a good revenge killing to kick off the week.
you miss me, Ren? Is that it?
just couldn't stay away?
missed a lot of things.
my family... my girl...
a nice prime rib Madeira.
you, not so much.
Yeah. Well, here you are.
and nothing's changed, except for the gray hair.
Hey, show a little respect.
his name's Special Agent Gibbs.
actually, I was talking about you.
I think I see a few sprouting.
I got a few gray hairs myself.
three years. It's a long time.
of course, in an eight-by-ten cell, feels more like 30.
that why you killed the guy who put you there?
looking for payback?
I didn't kill anybody.
so, Lieutenant Grady stuffed himself into a duffel bag.
I want to talk to Agent DiNozzo. Alone.
doesn't work that way.
I came to you.
and I didn't have to.
coffee.
coffee machine in the next room there?
he's gone. Talk.
I'm innocent. - You said that.
of the embezzlement charges.
you said that, too.
I can prove it.
I'm more interested in why the star witness from your case showed up in your duffel bag.
he wouldn't fit in my Samsonite.
keep it up. Juries love a smart-ass.
but of course, you must rember that.
I didn't kill Lieutenant Grady.
I just wanted to talk to him.
Really? About what?
we were friends, and he testified against me.
I had to find out why.
Grady wouldn't see me, but I knew he'd agree to see Agent DiNozzo, lead investigator on the case.
so I set up a meeting at the Rosewood.
I checked in early, went out to eat...
and when I got back, Grady was dead on my floor.
I don't know what happened. I swear to God.
I panicked.
I hid the body and got the hell out of there.
I screwed up. That's why I'm here.
the judge sentenced you to five years for embezzlement.
Yeah. I remember.
too bad I didn't have this.
what's that, a good luck charm?
