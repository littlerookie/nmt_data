and then eight hours later, it's...
china is a dead end.
I don't want blue hand to become one, too.
all right, do you know where you are?
I am in a hospital?
very good. Do you know who I am?
no.
but for some weird reason,
I get the feeling that your husband is a little bit of a neat freak.
I don't know. Something about how he doesn't like his black pens to touch his blue pens.
does that sound familiar?
she's back.
you're an amazing doctor.
I don't know. And an overworked one.
I wish I could be with you guys tonight.
Oh, we'll take pictures.
can you make sure she doesn't eat too much candy?
sure. -- Just, like, a couple of pieces or something.
couple? -- 20.
I'll see what I can do.
Bye.
when Mark had you pin the blue hand card to the board,
he knew it was somehow related to the word "Baltimore."
Yes, that's what I'm saying, sparky.
okay, Baltimore Street is 5 miles away.
let's go check it out.
but you were attacked last night in D.C.
so Baltimore, Maryland, is the better bet.
Yeah, but the guy who had the blue hand stamp on him was in L.A. all right?
Baltimore Street is in Silver Lake.
if I'm wrong- if I'm wrong,
we've wasted an hour.
what? -- So you believe in these visions now?
it's- it's complicated.
no, I get it.
I mean, if I hadn't had a flash-forward,
I'd be doing everything I could to prove those visions weren't true.
listen, if we had anything to go on at all here,
any real-life lead whatsoever,
believe me, I'd be the first guy talking to ballistics Or forensics or whatever, all right?
but we don't.
I just want to find the animals that are trying to kill us,
and Baltimore Street is the only thing I can think of,
all right? So come on.
I'll buy you a pressed sandwich from the Cuban Place.
sold.
one hour.
Oh, no!
super shark has Monkey-see and Monkey-do in his helmet!
he's trying to eat them!
daddy, that pulls. -- Just be still. I've almost got it.
I can't believe you don't have a costume.
you always have a costume.
I've been a little busy lately.
I can finish up with her if you want to get in your costume.
Thanks, Nicole, but I'm not wearing a costume.
you could go as Tim- Tim's dad, Jim Tim.
what does Tim- Tim's dad look like?
don't say a word, Obi-Wan.
you've got to be kidding me.
was that a kangaroo?
that is the best costume I have ever seen.
Hey, got some milk from the nurses' station to...
Dylan?
I'm- I'm sorry. I seem to have lost my son.
what's he look like?
uh, he's about this big, uh, wearing, um...
well- well, a pimp's outfit.
I mean, I only turned my head for a second.
haven't seen him, but there are tons of kids around.
you might want to check the nurses' station.
okay, thank you.
sir, you don't have to stay here with me.
I'm sure after everything that happened last night,
the office is chaotic.
I'm right where I need to be.
I just feel really uncomfortable. In this gown.
Yeah, I associate those crappy gowns with my wife delivering our son.
after you've seen a thing like that...
was it awful? -- Just the opposite. It's... primal.
you feel like you're there at the beginning.
of something... miraculous...
a new life.
you'll see.
what's that? -- That little monitor up there.
Janis, I'm sorry. We have to take you back to the O.R.
bring the type specific. -- What's wrong?
your blood count's dropping. Get her on a portable.
What--what's going on? What happened? -- I don't know.
times Square.
april 29th. The estimates on the mosaic web site have us at half a million people already.
the ball is gonna drop and everything.
half a million people going to their future.
it's a glorified New Year's party.
do you have something better to do?
Yeah, you could say that.
who is she?
Oh, come on. I told you mine.
he...
had a neck like an ox...
smelled like a meat locker...
what the hell were you guys doing?
I had my hands around his neck.
I don't know where I was or who the man was...
but I felt my thumbs press down on his trachea...
until something snapped.
and then I let go...
looked down at his lifeless body,
quite satisfied.
aren't you glad you asked?
I found this on the south exit camera. -- Yeah, that's him.
how long ago was this? -- 17 minutes.
where could he be heed this time of night?
I have no idea.
you getting on? Mm-hmm.
then get on. Come on. We gotta go.
Hey, kid, you gotta pay the fare! Hey!
Hey, kid.
you gotta pay the fare. Now do you have it or not?
are you lost?
to our friends at 25696 Sawyer Court,
Los Angeles, California, 90024.
what is he, brain damaged or something?
is he one of those --I'm gonna put you down like a sick dog if you don't shut up.
it's my house, too. -- That's your house?
you know that address?
Yeah, and he's gonna need a transfer. That's $1. 55.
don't worry, kid.
do you know any magic tricks?
no, mijo. I don't do magic.
you said an hour. It's been over three.
she's back in surgery.
she'll pull through. -- Why?
she had a flash-forward, so she has a future?
450 out, and she's tachy in the 130s.
what are we waiting for?
we only have one real option here.
5-0 vicryl.
with all due respect, Dr. Benford,
we're gonna do a B-Lynch.
did I ever tell you about the night before -- She and I graduated from Quantico? -- No.
we're at some dorm room getting hammered.
I get us a beer. We finish, she gets us a couple more,
then a couple of shots, and, uh, I'm starting to worry.
that nerdy little girl's gonna have to have her stomach pumped, right?
there's no guarantee that a B-Lynch will contain the bleeding.
a B-Lynch is a far less invasive procedure.
gives her a fighting chance of still having a normal, healthy uterus. -- Barely.
next thing I know, it's 4: 00 a.m.
I wake up on linoleum, got a foot in the toilet.
I look over. Janis is at the kitchen table playing quarters against herself.
her insides are stronger than any bullet.
I'll tell you that much.
be honest --Would you be making the same decision if you didn't know this patient personally?
5-0 vicryl.
let me get this straight.
you blacked out after five drinks,
and they let you keep your badge?
that's... -- You know why?
because I'm always right about everything.
it's like the hand on Mark's board.
trick or treat! -- Hey, guys. Dig in,
cowboy, princess. A very cool costume.
it's my house, too.
you really should see a dentist.
my parents couldn't afford braces.
thanks for coming out tonight.
I love Halloween.
and, uh, I was worried about you.
it's good to see you out doing normal stuff.
Yeah, I think it's a good idea for all of us to start...
let's get going!
okay. Paying a little bit more...
watch her.
Hey! -- Let's go!
FBI! Stop!
FBI! Stay where you are!
same hand, only this one's missing some fingers.
and, um, the other way.
that was the orientation on our assailant.
am I crazy, or does it look like it's pointing that way?
stop right there! FBI!
wasn't my...
it wasn't my idea!
I didn't throw any eggs! I just threw some toilet paper!
where did you get this mask?
99 cents store, man.
you're not gonna call my dad, are you?
Yeah, Nicole?
I'll be right there.
makes sense. You run an underground club,
you want to make sure only the right people find it.
if the hand's positioning is the direction,
why the missing fingers?
the last hand had three fingers, right?
we just drove three blocks.
that's it.
nice.
I'm sorry to bother you, but I tried Olivia first.
she's in surgery.
you did the right thing.
he came out of nowhere, and he had on this hospital bracelet.
that I was able to get off and call his dad.
he's on his way over.
I'm Mark. What's your name?
my name is Dylan. My favorite book is "Harry Potter, Prisoners of Azkaban."
my dad does magic.
okay, um, Dylan,
does your dad know you're here?
this is my house, too.
no, Dylan, this is my house, and I'm trying to find out How you got here from the hospital.
go ahead. It's your house, too.
how'd you know this address?
to our friends at 25696 Sawyer Court, Los Angeles, California, 90024.
Hey, Dylan! -- Hi, Charlie.
nuts to you, Squirrlio!
what was that?
it's from the cartoon.
Charlie, do you...do you know Dylan from school?
no, he's just my friend.
what?
excuse me.
hello. I think my son is here.
Yeah, he's right here. Come on in.
Oh, my god. Are you all right? -- Don't worry, he seems fine.
he just slipped out of the hospital.
I- I can't believe he'd just wander off.
um, thank you for taking such good care of him... -- Sure.
Mr... Benford. -- Mark Benford.
right, and I didn't catch your name.
Uh...L-Lloyd Simcoe.
uh, uh, this is my son Dylan.
Simcoe?
wait. -- Benford?
are you somehow related to Olivia...
um, um, Dr. Benford?
I'm her husband.
of course. That makes perfect sense.
uh, your name being Benford, her name being Benford.
trick or treat!
Hey, honey.
you're her.
not yet.
you know, Charlie...
why don't we double check your candy in the kitchen?
Nicole, you want to come? -- Good idea.
what's going on?
I thought you might know.
Dylan came here.
Why? -- This is my house, too.
it's your house, too, Dylan.
he keeps saying that.
Dylan is autistic.
the repetitive speech. -- I don't need a diagnosis.
now I understand.
what?
why I made her, why I made you so -- Uncomfortable? -- Yes.
um, okay, clearly, um,
this is an unusual situation.
no kidding. -- Mark, don't be like that.
I can make this comfortable for everybody.
you leave...
you don't come back.
I'm very sorry if we've caused you any inconvenience.
thank you...
both... for the kindness you've shown Dylan.
thank you.
it's my house, too.
good night, Olivia.
come on, Dylan. Let's go.
good night, Dylan.
looks like the party's over.
definitely over.
FBI.
blue hand.
these came from a friend of yours named Maya...
worried about you.
you okay?
when I got shot...
the bullet...
bounced around all over the place.
the only thing they said they could do without taking the whole thing out...
Olivia did this thing called a B-Lynch.
but with all the scarring...
they said that it's gonna be almost impossible...
why am I crying?
I never even wanted to have a baby.
it's gonna be all right.
I can see why you like him. He's very charming.
I don't like him. Come on.
can you stop so we can actually talk about this?
I don't like him. He's the father of one of my patients.
I know who he is.
what I want to know is how his son found his way here.
I have no idea.
Really? -- Yeah.
well, I'm a little confused, because I thought you said,
you had Dylan moved off your rotation.
I did. -- You did?
then why are you listed as the attending on his wristband?
Oh, god. I had nothing to do with that.
my boss made the decision.
your boss also tell you not to say anything about it?
no, I didn't say anything about it because I thought it would make a horrendous situation that much worse.
Oh, so you thought hiding it was a better plan.
that's not what was going on, Mark.
don't turn me into someone I'm not.
don't you turn this around and make it about me.
the man you might be sleeping with in six months' time was just in our living room, and I sure as hell.
didn't bring him into our lives, you did!
that's not fair.
just be honest. Just be honest.
have- have you been talking to him at work?
Oh, come on! Come on, Mark.
huh? Have you done anything else I should know about?
mark, don't interrogate me.
then be honest with me! -- I am!
are you being honest with me?
Oh, what are you talking about?
all the old patterns are back, Mark.
you're out of the house all the time.
you're more and more secretive.
so I'm asking you the same thing that you asked me...
be honest. Are you hiding anything from me?
mark?
in my flash-forward...
I was drinking.
Wow.
here we are again.
Olivia this isn't like before.
the lying's already started.
what? No, it hasn't. This isn't the same.
don't condemn me for something I haven't done yet.
did you even hear what you just said?
you've been punishing me this whole time for an imaginary relationship.
but when it comes back to you, you want to be let off the hook.
but our past together, Mark.
all we've been through with your drinking...
that's real.
that still hurts.
I'm not going through it again.
I promise you...
I'm not gonna drink.
but it's not about the drinking.
you know that.
it's about trust.
it's about trust, and we don't trust each other anymore.
so everything we said at the hospital today,
about only living in the moment, well...
all that was a lie?
it's not a lie.
it's what I want.
I just don't know if it's possible anymore...
not now...
not with us.
Hey, Demetri?
am I missing something?
I mean, on the same night our guy tries to kill Janis,
he's hanging out here?
I don't know, but they found this on one of the bodies.
remember the Rutherford case?
we were talking about a case.
that I don't think even exists yet.
the Rutherford case.
it begins tonight.
all right.
it was quite a day, huh?
is it gonna be Halloween again tomorrow?
no.
just today.
good, because it was kind of scary.
Yeah.
Yes, it was.
I'll see you in the morning.
thanks for coming to get me, daddy.
Oh, damn it,
Simon. You scared me half to death.
did you ever take the train down to the coast, Lloyd
breathtaking.
what do you want?
you disappear to Los Angeles.
you don't return my calls.
I'm worried about you. We all are.
Yeah, well, I made it perfectly clear I don't want to see any of you right now.
I don't care. We have to talk.
our experiment killed 20 million people, Simon.
what more is there to say?
the last time mark had a problem, he was away from me testifying in one of his cases.
why can't you remember everything?
because I was loaded, okay?
before he turned around, the flash-forward ended.
so I don't think he saw me.
his son's your patient.
my son's condition makes him a little hard to read.
Dylan's autistic.
you're panicked over what might happen.
but we've gotta use these flash-forwards to our advantage.
Hey, mark.
we got our funding. Mosaic's still alive.
I know what caused the flash-forwards.
you don't believe me.
well, of course I do.
the world's greatest mystery's been solved by a boozer on a train bound for Los Angeles.
can you connect to the internet with that?
real quick, do an image search for "quantum physicist genius.
go on. I'll wait.
which popped up first--me winning the Robert Wilson award or the jaunty one of me holding lab goggles over my genitals
hold up.
you really... - I'm obviously wasting my time.
I'm sorry.
I've just heard that line a hundred times before.
you genuinely want to know?
of course.
the flash-forwards were caused by you.
it's simple quantum mechanics, really.
whenever a heavenly body carries such an intense force of attraction, the universe just goes... bananas.
sounds technical.
helps if you have a Ph.D or two.
if my calculations are correct, your dark energy could bring about another catastrophe at any moment.
luckily, I've pinpointed the one location on earth that has an irresistible enough force to counteract you.
let me guess
your sleeper car. - Grab your purse.
we've not a moment to lose.
I thought for sure that would work.
maybe for a 21-year-old sorority girl.
but, um, I've learned never to go anywhere unless I'm gonna get the real thing.
the actual cause?
I have a theory, but the, uh...
the science is a little complicated.
I'm a complicated girl.
the most basic concept you need to understand is quantum superpositions.
are you aware of the double slit experiment?
well, there was that one time in college... - What about Schrodinger's cat?
no, I'm not that kinky.
close your eyes.
give me your hand.
okay.
now imagine you have a cat...
B. L.'S a liter in the field and only one P. I.V.
we need access here!
a teeny, tiny cat...
what have we got? - We've got a gunshot wound to the abdomen.
we need to set up a peripheral.
Janis? - We need access here!
that fits in the palm of your hand.
you also have a poisonous sardine.
once we close your palm, there are two possible scenarios.
bring the code cart.
come on, let's go.
clear.
either the cat eats the sardine and dies, or the cat doesn't eat the sardine and lives.
no response.
going again.
quantum physics says until we open your hand to discover the cat's fate, both eventualities occur at the same time.
clear.
still no response.
do C. P.R.
for us, the cat is both living and deceased.
but how can that be?
that's the miracle of quantum mechanics
the observer gets to decide.
the kitty's already made up its mind.
alive or dead?
see for yourself.
Hemoglobin's holding at 12.
Hallelujah.
okay.
Fascia's closed.
o" silk on a driver to dr. Varley.
I'm gonna be honest.
a few hours ago, I didn't think we'd get this far.
close the silk.
let me know when she wakes up.
this is mark. leave it here. I'll get back to you.
Hi. It's me.
where are you?
I have been calling and calling.
I tried Demetri and Stan.
I just can't get through.
I tried the office, and they're just stonewalling me.
after this thing with Janis, I don't know, I'm worried.
can you just call me?
please?
I love you.
I love you.
again, daddy, again.
you're not bored with this one?
No!
cards.
make the cards.
okay.
I'll turn around, and you choose.
so, Dylan, you know it's almost time for you to leave the hospital.
we're gonna go to Palo Alto.
which one?
which one?
did you pick a card?
okay, now look at it and remember.
okay?
okay.
so now it's just you and me.
I was thinking that the best idea is you come and live in my house with me.
no.
cards.
we all lived there before your mother and I...
I mean, you'll have your own room.
it' be great.
cards!
please.
I need you to go along with this.
okay.
uh... is this your card?
it's my house, too.
Hey, buddy.
almost time for trick-or-treating.
that's today?
Yeah, it's the 31st.
it's Halloween. The kids go from room
no, no, no, I know. I just forgot to get him a costume.
um, I'll be right back, okay?
excuse me.
playing cards, bud?
it's my house, too.
how's Janis?
two uniformed cops outside her room.
only her doctor an FBI badges are allowed inside.
good work.
no one will be able to get to her.
but what about you guys?
whoever it was that came after you last night, what's to stop them from trying again?
nothing.
Hey!
are you okay? What happened?
Yeah, yeah. It's nothing. It's nothing.
but you have blood on your shirt.
well, now listen.
there's a room full of FBI agents that need a doctor to tell them if Janis is gonna make it.
okay. - All right.
okay.
we had her in surgery for five hours.
the bullet did some damage, but there shouldn't be any lasting effects.
And?
and she's in recovery.
she's sedated.
we'll know more when she wakes up.
Olivia, you saved her life.
thank you.
all right, everybody, it's been a long night for all of us.
it'll be a while before we know anything more.
the hospital doesn't need us clogging things up.
so I got your numbers. Get some rest.
I'll call you if I hear anything.
you, too, Demetri.
I'm sorry, boss, no.
I'm either staying here to see her through, or I'm going out and finding the people who did this to us.
there are already two dozen agents working this who didn't have a grenade launched at them last night.
now I'm serious.
get outta here.
and if it helps, consider it an order.
you tired?
well, Wedeck told us to go home.
no.
he said for us to get out of the hospital.
it's a surface wound. Just leave it.
are you kidding me? I want to see what those D. C. Doctors did.
Oh, Livy, it's nothing.
come on.
you want to tell me what happened?
you don't... - I want to know.
we were attacked.
um, pretty bad firefight.
Wedeck and Demetri killed one of them.
the others escaped.
it's gotta be connected to the guys who came after Janis.
simultaneous attacks.
because you're investigating the blackout?
why would anyone want to kill you because of that?
I don't know.
I don't know.
still trying to figure it all out.
Oh, see?
I knew I shouldn't have told you.
no.
no, it's not that.
it's... when they brought Janis in,
I couldn't get ahold of you.
my imagination just ran wild
I mean, not knowing where you were, not knowing what was going on.
it was horrible.
but I'm here, and I'm okay, all right?
I'm all right.
we have just been so... obsessed with what we saw, and with the future, with what might or might not happen.
and it's-- It's a distraction.
it's just pulling us out of today, and today, right now this moment is all we have, babe.
it's all we have.
I don't want to miss it.
me neither.
Hey, Dewey.
how is she?
a lot better than these guys.
do you mind?
got no I. D...
no cell phone, no keys.
no fingerprints, no dental records.
it's just like our guy in the parking garage in D. C.
we got nothing.
got nothing.
there's no question now we're up against real pros.
what about, um, medical history, Dewey?
so far just one removed appendix here, one Achilles surgery there.
I'm checking for radial keratotomy scars as we speak.
Hey, Demetri.
yeah? What?
you doing okay in here?
Yeah.
Why?
you put yourself on mosaic.
you think there's anybody in the office who doesn't know by now?
but the point is, you just got shot at 12 hours ago.
now you're standing in a morgue acting kind of weird.
listen, Al, you've been acting kind of weird for a couple of weeks yourself, all right?
um, you want to talk about our feelings, or you want to get back to work?
work sounds good.
this guy's right eye is covered with corneal scarring.
no big surprise there.
what assassin worth his salt doesn't get like?
should practically be a union requirement.
wait.
you see that?
it's like a hand stamp from a bar.
no, it's a blue hand.
it's a clue from mark's board.
something about Baltimore-- a hand--a blue hand.
this son of a bitch is gonna be useful after all.
that costume is super fly.
it was the last thing they had left in his size.
no, I like it. Really, it's cool.
although he doesn't seem to like this very much.
Yeah, it's hard to tell with him.
I think 's mad at me about the move.
Oh, I was just wondering if in the next couple of days dr. Benford might come by so we could, say our good-byes.
Yeah.
Yeah, sure, I'll let her know.
great, thanks.
Hey.
I'm glad she's okay.
Yeah.
it's pretty scary stuff for all of us.
Yeah.
listen, it's been a rough week, and maybe I said some things that were out of line.
let's take a deep breath and get back on track here, hmm?
this only takes quarters.
I got it.
there. - Thank you.
we're even now.
the guys who came after you, the guys who shot Janis-- all Asian.
why don't I head over to Huang's office, see if blue hand has some special significance in Cantonese or mandarin?
Mandarin?
come on, man.
according to the CIA, China might have caused the blackout.
if they did, trying to blow up a team of federal agents seems a little showy, don't you thk?
well, in their minds, I mean, it could be as simple as neutralizing a threat.
well, then why come after us?
the CIA agent who testified at the hearings yesterday is fine, but mark talks about D. Gibbons, suspect zero, the crows for the first time outside of this office, and then eight hours later, it's... China is a dead end.
I don't want blue hand to become one, too.
all right, do you know where you are?
I am in a hospital?
very good.
do you know who I am?
no.
but for some weird reason,
I get the feeling that your husband is a little bit of a neat freak.
I don't know.
something about how he doesn't let his black pens to touch his blue pens.
does that sound familiar?
she's back.
you're an amazing doctor. - And an overworked one.
I wish I could be with you guys tonight.
Oh, we'll take pictures.
can you make sure she doesn't eat too much candy?
sure. - Just, like, a couple of pieces or something.
couple?
20.0
I'll see what I can do.
Bye.
when mark had you pin the blue hand card to the board, he knew it was somehow related to the word "Baltimore."
Yes, that's what I'm saying, sparky.
okay, Baltimore street is 5 miles away.
let's go check it out.
but you were attacked last night in D. C.
so Baltimore, Maryland, is the better bet.
Yeah, but the guy who had the blue hand stamp on him was in L. A. All right?
Baltimore street is in silver lake.
if I'm wrong -- We've wasted an hour.
what?
so you believe in these visions now?
it's--it's complicated.
no, I get it.
I mean, if I hadn't had a flash-forward,
I'd be doing everything I could to prove those visions weren't true.
listen, if we had anything to go on at all here, any real-life lead whatsoever, believe me, I'd be the first guy talking to ballistics or forensics or whatever, all right?
but we don't.
I just want to find the animal that are trying to kill us, and Baltimore street is the only thing I can think of, all right?
so come on.
I'll buy you a pressed sandwich from the Cuban place.
sold.
one out.
super shark has monkey-see and monkey-do in his helmet!
he's trying to eat them!
daddy, that pulls.
just be still. I've almost got it.
I can't believe you don't have a costume.
you always have a costume.
I've been a little busy lately.
I can finish up with her if you want to get in your costume.
Thanks, Nicole, but I'm not wearing a costume.
you could go as Tim-Tim's dad, Jim tim.
what does Tim-Tim's dad look like?
don't say a word, Obi-Wan.
you've got to be kidding me.
was that a kangaroo?
that is the best costume I have ever seen.
Hey, got some milk from the nurses' station to...
I'm--I'm sorry.
I seem to have lost my son.
what's he look like?
uh, he's about this big, uh, wearing, um... well--well, a pimp's outfit.
I mean, I only turned my head for a second.
haven't seen him, but there are tons of kids around.
you might want to check the nurses' station.
okay, thank you.
sir, you don't have to stay here with me.
I'm sure after everything that happened last night, the office is chaotic.
I'm right where I need to be.
I just feel really uncomfortable in this gown and...
I associate those crappy gowns with my wife delivering our son.
after you've seen a thing like that...
was it awful?
just the opposite.
it's... primal.
you feel like you're there at the beginning of something...miraculous... a new life.
you'll see.
what's that?
that little monitor up there.
Janis, I'm sorry. We have to take you back to the O. R.
bring the type specific.
what's wrong? - Your blood count's dropping.
get her on a portable. - What--what's going on?
don't know.
times Square.
april 29th.
the estimates on the mosaic web site have us at half a million people already.
the ball is gonna drop and everything.
half a million people going to their future.
it's a glorified new year's party.
do you have something better to do?
Yeah, you could say that.
who is she?
Oh, come on.
I told you mine.
he... had a neck like an ox...
smelled like a meat locker...
what the hell were you guys doing?
I had my hands around his neck.
I don't know where I was or who the man was...
but I felt my thumbs press down on his trachea...until something snapped.
and then I let go...
looked down at his lifeless body, quite satisfied.
aren't you glad you asked?
I found this on the south exit camera.
Yeah, that's him.
how long ago was this?
17 minutes.
where could he be heed this time of night?
I have no idea.
you getting on? Then get on.
come on. We gotta go.
Hey, kid, you gotta pay the re!
Hey, kid.
you gotta pay the fare.
now do you have it or not?
are you lost?
to our friends at 25696 sawyer court, Los Angeles, California, 90024.
what is he, brain damaged or something?
is he one of those... - I'm gonna put you down like a sick dog if you don't shut up.
it's my house, too.
that's your house?
you know that address?
Yeah, and he's gonna need a transfer.
that's $1. 55.
don't worry, kid.
do you know any magic tricks?
no, Mijo.
I don't do magic.
you said an hour.
it's been over three.
she's back in surgery.
she'll pull through.
Why?
she had a flash-forward, so she has a future?
450 out, and she's tachy in the 130s.
what are we waiting for?
we only have one real option here.
5-0 vicryl.
with all due respect, dr. Benford...- We're gonna do a b-lynch.
did I ever tell you about the night before she and I graduated from Quantico?
no.
we're at some dorm room getting hammered.
I get us a beer. We finish.
she gets us a couple more, then a couple of shots, and, uh,
I'm starting to worry that nerdy little girl's gonna have to have her stomach pumped, right?
there's no guarantee that a b-lynch will contain the bleeding.
a b-lynch is a far less invasive procedure.
gives her a fighting chance of still having a normal, healthy uterus.
Ba next thing I know, it's 4: 00 A. M.
I wake up on linoleum, got a foot in the toilet.
I look over. Janis is at the kitchen table playing quarte against herself.
her insides are stronger than any bullet.
I'll tell you that much.
be honest-- would you be making the same decision if you didn't know this patient personally?
5-0 vicryl.
let me get this straight
you blacked out after five drinks, and they let you keep your badge?
that's... you know why?
because I'm always right about everything.
it's like the hand on mark's board.
trick or treat!
Hey, guys.
dig in, cowboy, princess.
a very cool costume.
And?
Hey!
it's my house, too.
you really should see a dentist.
my parents couldn't afford braces.
thanks for coming out tonight.
I love Halloween.
and, uh, I was worried about you.
it's good to see you out doing normal stuff.
Yeah, I think it's a good idea for all of us to start...
let's get going! - Okay.
paying a little bit more...watch her.
Hey!
stop! FBI! Stay where you are!
same hand, only this one's missing some fingers.
and, um, the other way.
that was the orientation on our assailant.
am I crazy, or does it look like it's pointing that way?
I just threw some toilet paper!
where did you get this mask?
99 cents store, man.
you're not gonna call my dad, are you?
Yeah, Nicole?
I'll be right there. - Makes sense.
you run an underground club, you want to make sure only the right people find it.
if the hand's positioning is the direction, why the missing fingers?
the last hand had three fingers, right?
we just drove three blocks.
that's it.
nice.
I'm sorry to bother you, but I tried Olivia first.
she's in surgery.
you did the right thing.
he came out of nowhere, and he had on this hospital bracelet that I was able to get off and call his dad.
he's on his way over.
I'm mark.
what's your name?
my name is Dylan.
my favorite book is "Harry Potter," prisoners of Azkaban.
my dad does magic.
okay, um, Dylan, does your dad know you're here?
this is my house, too.
no, Dylan, this is my house, and I'm trying to find out how you got here from the hospital.
go ahead. It's your house, too.
how did you know this address?
to our friends at 25696 sawyer court, "Los Angeles, California, 90024.
Hey, Dylan! - Hi, Charlie.
nuts to you, Squirrlio!
toot, toot!
what was that?
it's from the cartoon.
Charlie, do you-- do you know Dylan from school?
no, he's just my friend.
what?
hello.
I think my son is here.
Yeah, he's right here.
come on in.
Oh, my god. Are you all right?
he seems fine. - He just slipped out of the hospital.
I-I can't believe he'd just wander off.
um, thank you for taking such good care of him...Mr...
and I didn't catch your name.
this is my son Dylan.
wait.
are you somehow related to Olivia -- dr. Benford?
I'm her husband.
of-- of course.
that-- that makes perfect sense
your name being Benford, her name being Benford.
trick or treat!
Hey, honey.
you're her.
not yet.
you know, Charlie... Why don't we double check your candy in the kitchen?
Nicole, you want to come? - good idea.
what's going on?
I thought you might know.
Dylan came here.
Why?
this is my house, too.
it's your house, too, Dylan.
he keeps saying that.
Dylan is autistic the repetitive speech... - I don't need a diagnosis.
now I understand.
what?
why I made her-- Why I made you so
uncomfortable? - Yes.
okay, clearly, um, this is an unusual situation.
no kidding. - Mark, don't be like that.
I can make this comfortable for everybody.
you leave... you don't come back.
I'm very sorry if we've caused you any inconvenience.
thank you... both... for the kindness you've shown Dylan.
thank you.
it's my house, too.
good night, Olivia.
come on, Dylan.
let's go. - Good night, Dylan.
looks like the party's over.
definitely over.
this came from a friend of yours named Maya... worried about you.
you okay?
when I got shot...
the bullet... bounced around all over the place.
the only thing they said they could do without taking the whole thing out...
Olivia did this thing called a b-lynch.
but with all the scarring...
they said that it's gonna be almost impossible...
why am I crying?
I never even wanted to have a baby.
it's gonna be all right.
I can see why you like him. He's very charming.
I don't like M. Come on.
can you stop so we can actually talk about this?
I don't like him.
he's the father of one of my patients. - I know who he is.
what I want to know is how his son found his way here.
I have no idea.
Really?
Yeah.
well, I'm a little confused, because I thought you said you had Dylan moved off your rotation.
I did.
you did?
then why are you listed as the attending on his wristband?
Oh, god.
I had nothing to do with that. My boss made the decision.
your boss also tell you not to say anything about it?
no, I didn't say anything about it because I thought it would make a horrendous situation that much worse.
Oh, so you thought hiding it was a better plan.
that's not what was going on, mark.
don't turn me into someone I'm not.
don't you turn this around and make it about me.
the man you might be sleeping with in six months' time was just in our living room, and I sure as hell didn't bring him into our lives.
you did!
that's not fair.
just be honest.
just be honest.
have -- have you been talking to him at work?
Oh, come on!
come on, Mark.
have you done anything else I should know about?
mark, don't interrogate me.
then be honest with me!
I am!
are you being honest with me?
Oh, what are you talking about?
all the old patterns are back, mark.
you're out of the house all the time.
you're more and more secretive.
so I'm asking you the same thing that you asked me... be honest.
are you hiding anything from me?
in my flash-forward... I was drinking.
here we are again.
Olivia this isn't like before.
the lying's already started.
what?
no, it hasn't.
this isn't the same. Don't condemn me for something I haven't done yet.
did you even hear what you just said?
you've been punishing me this whole time for an imaginary relationship.
but when it comes back to you, you want to be let off the hook.
but our past together, mark-- all we've been through with your drinking... that's real.
that still hurts.
I'm not going through it again.
I promise you... I'm not gonna drink.
but it's not about the drinking.
you know that.
it's about trust.
it's about trust, and we don't trust each other anymore.
so, everything we said at the hospital today about only living in the moment, well... all that was a lie?
it's not a lie.
it's what I want.
I just don't know if it's possible anymore...
not now... not with us.
Hey, Demetri?
am I missing something?
I mean, on the same night our guy tries to kill Janis, he's hanging out here?
I don't know, but they found this on one of the bodies.
remember the Rutherford case?
we were talking about a case that I don't think even exists yet -- the Rutherford case.
it begins tonight.
all right.
it was quite a day, huh?
is it gonna be Halloween again tomorrow?
no.
just today.
good, 'cause it was kind of scary.
Yeah.
Yes, it was.
I'll see you in the morning.
thanks for coming to get me, daddy.
Oh, damn it, Simon. You scared me half to death.
did you ever take the train down the coast, Loyd?
breathtaking.
what do you want?
you disappear to Los Angeles.
you don't return my calls.
I'm worried about you.
we all are.
Yeah, well, I made it perfectly clear I don't want to see any of you right now.
I don't care.
we have to talk.
our experiment killed 20 million people, Simon.
what more is there to say?
the last time mark had a problem, he was away from me testifying in one of his cases.
why can't you remember everything?
because I was loaded, okay?
before he turned around, the flash-forward ended.
so I don't think he saw me.
his son's your patient.
my son's condition makes him a little hard to read.
Dylan's autistic.
you're panicked over what might happen.
but we've gotta use these flash-forwards to our advantage.
Hey, mark.
we got our funding. Mosaic's still alive.
I know what caused the flash-forwards.
you don't believe me.
well, of course I do.
the world's greatest mystery's been solved by a boozer on a train bound for Los Angeles.
can you connect to the internet with that?
real quick, do an image search for "quantum physicist genius.
go on. I'll wait.
which popped up first--me winning the Robert Wilson award or the jaunty one of me holding lab goggles over my genitals
hold up.
you really... - I'm obviously wasting my time.
I'm sorry.
I've just heard that line a hundred times before.
you genuinely want to know?
of course.
the flash-forwards were caused by you.
it's simple quantum mechanics, really.
whenever a heavenly body carries such an intense force of attraction, the universe just goes... bananas.
sounds technical.
helps if you have a Ph.D or two.
if my calculations are correct, your dark energy could bring about another catastrophe at any moment.
luckily, I've pinpointed the one location on earth that has an irresistible enough force to counteract you.
let me guess
your sleeper car. - Grab your purse.
we've not a moment to lose.
I thought for sure that would work.
maybe for a 21-year-old sorority girl.
but, um, I've learned never to go anywhere unless I'm gonna get the real thing.
the actual cause?
I have a theory, but the, uh...
the science is a little complicated.
I'm a complicated girl.
the most basic concept you need to understand is quantum superpositions.
are you aware of the double slit experiment?
well, there was that one time in college... - What about Schrodinger's cat?
no, I'm not that kinky.
close your eyes.
give me your hand.
okay.
now imagine you have a cat...
B. L.'S a liter in the field and only one P. I.V.
we need access here!
a teeny, tiny cat...
what have we got? - We've got a gunshot wound to the abdomen.
we need to set up a peripheral.
Janis? - We need access here!
that fits in the palm of your hand.
you also have a poisonous sardine.
once we close your palm, there are two possible scenarios.
bring the code cart.
come on, let's go.
clear.
either the cat eats the sardine and dies, or the cat doesn't eat the sardine and lives.
no response.
going again.
quantum physics says until we open your hand to discover the cat's fate, both eventualities occur at the same time.
clear.
still no response.
do C. P.R.
for us, the cat is both living and deceased.
but how can that be?
that's the miracle of quantum mechanics
the observer gets to decide.
the kitty's already made up its mind.
alive or dead?
see for yourself.
Hemoglobin's holding at 12.
Hallelujah.
okay.
Fascia's closed.
o" silk on a driver to dr. Varley.
I'm gonna be honest.
a few hours ago, I didn't think we'd get this far.
close the silk.
let me know when she wakes up.
this is mark. leave it here. I'll get back to you.
Hi. It's me.
where are you?
I have been calling and calling.
I tried Demetri and Stan.
I just can't get through.
I tried the office, and they're just stonewalling me.
after this thing with Janis, I don't know, I'm worried.
can you just call me?
please?
I love you.
I love you.
again, daddy, again.
you're not bored with this one?
No!
cards.
make the cards.
okay.
I'll turn around, and you choose.
so, Dylan, you know it's almost time for you to leave the hospital.
we're gonna go to Palo Alto.
which one?
which one?
did you pick a card?
okay, now look at it and remember.
okay?
okay.
so now it's just you and me.
I was thinking that the best idea is you come and live in my house with me.
no.
cards.
we all lived there before your mother and I...
I mean, you'll have your own room.
it' be great.
cards!
please.
I need you to go along with this.
okay.
uh... is this your card?
it's my house, too.
Hey, buddy.
almost time for trick-or-treating.
that's today?
Yeah, it's the 31st.
it's Halloween. The kids go from room
no, no, no, I know. I just forgot to get him a costume.
um, I'll be right back, okay?
excuse me.
playing cards, bud?
it's my house, too.
how's Janis?
two uniformed cops outside her room.
only her doctor an FBI badges are allowed inside.
good work.
no one will be able to get to her.
but what about you guys?
whoever it was that came after you last night, what's to stop them from trying again?
nothing.
Hey!
are you okay? What happened?
Yeah, yeah. It's nothing. It's nothing.
but you have blood on your shirt.
well, now listen.
there's a room full of FBI agents that need a doctor to tell them if Janis is gonna make it.
okay. - All right.
okay.
we had her in surgery for five hours.
the bullet did some damage, but there shouldn't be any lasting effects.
And?
and she's in recovery.
she's sedated.
we'll know more when she wakes up.
Olivia, you saved her life.
thank you.
all right, everybody, it's been a long night for all of us.
it'll be a while before we know anything more.
the hospital doesn't need us clogging things up.
so I got your numbers. Get some rest.
I'll call you if I hear anything.
you, too, Demetri.
I'm sorry, boss, no.
I'm either staying here to see her through, or I'm going out and finding the people who did this to us.
there are already two dozen agents working this who didn't have a grenade launched at them last night.
now I'm serious.
get outta here.
and if it helps, consider it an order.
you tired?
well, Wedeck told us to go home.
no.
he said for us to get out of the hospital.
it's a surface wound. Just leave it.
are you kidding me? I want to see what those D. C. Doctors did.
Oh, Livy, it's nothing.
come on.
you want to tell me what happened?
you don't... - I want to know.
we were attacked.
um, pretty bad firefight.
Wedeck and Demetri killed one of them.
the others escaped.
it's gotta be connected to the guys who came after Janis.
simultaneous attacks.
because you're investigating the blackout?
why would anyone want to kill you because of that?
I don't know.
I don't know.
still trying to figure it all out.
Oh, see?
I knew I shouldn't have told you.
no.
no, it's not that.
it's... when they brought Janis in,
I couldn't get ahold of you.
my imagination just ran wild
I mean, not knowing where you were, not knowing what was going on.
it was horrible.
but I'm here, and I'm okay, all right?
I'm all right.
we have just been so... obsessed with what we saw, and with the future, with what might or might not happen.
and it's-- It's a distraction.
it's just pulling us out of today, and today, right now this moment is all we have, babe.
it's all we have.
I don't want to miss it.
me neither.
Hey, Dewey.
how is she?
a lot better than these guys.
do you mind?
got no I. D...
no cell phone, no keys.
no fingerprints, no dental records.
it's just like our guy in the parking garage in D. C.
we got nothing.
got nothing.
there's no question now we're up against real pros.
what about, um, medical history, Dewey?
so far just one removed appendix here, one Achilles surgery there.
I'm checking for radial keratotomy scars as we speak.
Hey, Demetri.
yeah? What?
you doing okay in here?
Yeah.
Why?
you put yourself on mosaic.
you think there's anybody in the office who doesn't know by now?
but the point is, you just got shot at 12 hours ago.
now you're standing in a morgue acting kind of weird.
listen, Al, you've been acting kind of weird for a couple of weeks yourself, all right?
um, you want to talk about our feelings, or you want to get back to work?
work sounds good.
this guy's right eye is covered with corneal scarring.
no big surprise there.
what assassin worth his salt doesn't get like?
should practically be a union requirement.
wait.
you see that?
it's like a hand stamp from a bar.
no, it's a blue hand.
it's a clue from mark's board.
something about Baltimore-- a hand--a blue hand.
this son of a bitch is gonna be useful after all.
that costume is super fly.
it was the last thing they had left in his size.
no, I like it. Really, it's cool.
although he doesn't seem to like this very much.
Yeah, it's hard to tell with him.
I think 's mad at me about the move.
Oh, I was just wondering if in the next couple of days dr. Benford might come by so we could, say our good-byes.
Yeah.
Yeah, sure, I'll let her know.
great, thanks.
Hey.
I'm glad she's okay.
Yeah.
it's pretty scary stuff for all of us.
Yeah.
listen, it's been a rough week, and maybe I said some things that were out of line.
let's take a deep breath and get back on track here, hmm?
this only takes quarters.
I got it.
there. - Thank you.
we're even now.
the guys who came after you, the guys who shot Janis-- all Asian.
why don't I head over to Huang's office, see if blue hand has some special significance in Cantonese or mandarin?
Mandarin?
come on, man.
according to the CIA, China might have caused the blackout.
if they did, trying to blow up a team of federal agents seems a little showy, don't you thk?
well, in their minds, I mean, it could be as simple as neutralizing a threat.
well, then why come after us?
the CIA agent who testified at the hearings yesterday is fine, but mark talks about D. Gibbons, suspect zero, the crows for the first time outside of this office, and then eight hours later, it's... China is a dead end.
I don't want blue hand to become one, too.
all right, do you know where you are?
I am in a hospital?
very good.
do you know who I am?
no.
but for some weird reason,
I get the feeling that your husband is a little bit of a neat freak.
I don't know.
something about how he doesn't let his black pens to touch his blue pens.
does that sound familiar?
she's back.
you're an amazing doctor. - And an overworked one.
I wish I could be with you guys tonight.
Oh, we'll take pictures.
can you make sure she doesn't eat too much candy?
sure. - Just, like, a couple of pieces or something.
couple?
20.0
I'll see what I can do.
Bye.
when mark had you pin the blue hand card to the board, he knew it was somehow related to the word "Baltimore."
Yes, that's what I'm saying, sparky.
okay, Baltimore street is 5 miles away.
let's go check it out.
but you were attacked last night in D. C.
so Baltimore, Maryland, is the better bet.
Yeah, but the guy who had the blue hand stamp on him was in L. A. All right?
Baltimore street is in silver lake.
if I'm wrong -- We've wasted an hour.
what?
so you believe in these visions now?
it's--it's complicated.
no, I get it.
I mean, if I hadn't had a flash-forward,
I'd be doing everything I could to prove those visions weren't true.
listen, if we had anything to go on at all here, any real-life lead whatsoever, believe me, I'd be the first guy talking to ballistics or forensics or whatever, all right?
but we don't.
I just want to find the animal that are trying to kill us, and Baltimore street is the only thing I can think of, all right?
so come on.
I'll buy you a pressed sandwich from the Cuban place.
sold.
one out.
super shark has monkey-see and monkey-do in his helmet!
he's trying to eat them!
daddy, that pulls.
just be still. I've almost got it.
I can't believe you don't have a costume.
you always have a costume.
I've been a little busy lately.
I can finish up with her if you want to get in your costume.
Thanks, Nicole, but I'm not wearing a costume.
you could go as Tim-Tim's dad, Jim tim.
what does Tim-Tim's dad look like?
don't say a word, Obi-Wan.
you've got to be kidding me.
was that a kangaroo?
that is the best costume I have ever seen.
Hey, got some milk from the nurses' station to...
I'm--I'm sorry.
I seem to have lost my son.
what's he look like?
uh, he's about this big, uh, wearing, um... well--well, a pimp's outfit.
I mean, I only turned my head for a second.
haven't seen him, but there are tons of kids around.
you might want to check the nurses' station.
okay, thank you.
sir, you don't have to stay here with me.
I'm sure after everything that happened last night, the office is chaotic.
I'm right where I need to be.
I just feel really uncomfortable in this gown and...
I associate those crappy gowns with my wife delivering our son.
after you've seen a thing like that...
was it awful?
just the opposite.
it's... primal.
you feel like you're there at the beginning of something...miraculous... a new life.
you'll see.
what's that?
that little monitor up there.
Janis, I'm sorry. We have to take you back to the O. R.
bring the type specific.
what's wrong? - Your blood count's dropping.
get her on a portable. - What--what's going on?
don't know.
times Square.
april 29th.
the estimates on the mosaic web site have us at half a million people already.
the ball is gonna drop and everything.
half a million people going to their future.
it's a glorified new year's party.
do you have something better to do?
Yeah, you could say that.
who is she?
Oh, come on.
I told you mine.
he... had a neck like an ox...
smelled like a meat locker...
what the hell were you guys doing?
I had my hands around his neck.
I don't know where I was or who the man was...
but I felt my thumbs press down on his trachea...until something snapped.
and then I let go...
looked down at his lifeless body, quite satisfied.
aren't you glad you asked?
I found this on the south exit camera.
Yeah, that's him.
how long ago was this?
17 minutes.
where could he be heed this time of night?
I have no idea.
you getting on? Then get on.
come on. We gotta go.
Hey, kid, you gotta pay the re!
Hey, kid.
you gotta pay the fare.
now do you have it or not?
are you lost?
to our friends at 25696 sawyer court, Los Angeles, California, 90024.
what is he, brain damaged or something?
is he one of those... - I'm gonna put you down like a sick dog if you don't shut up.
it's my house, too.
that's your house?
you know that address?
Yeah, and he's gonna need a transfer.
that's $1. 55.
don't worry, kid.
do you know any magic tricks?
no, Mijo.
I don't do magic.
you said an hour.
it's been over three.
she's back in surgery.
she'll pull through.
Why?
she had a flash-forward, so she has a future?
450 out, and she's tachy in the 130s.
what are we waiting for?
we only have one real option here.
5-0 vicryl.
with all due respect, dr. Benford...- We're gonna do a b-lynch.
did I ever tell you about the night before she and I graduated from Quantico?
no.
we're at some dorm room getting hammered.
I get us a beer. We finish.
she gets us a couple more, then a couple of shots, and, uh,
I'm starting to worry that nerdy little girl's gonna have to have her stomach pumped, right?
there's no guarantee that a b-lynch will contain the bleeding.
a b-lynch is a far less invasive procedure.
gives her a fighting chance of still having a normal, healthy uterus.
Ba next thing I know, it's 4: 00 A. M.
I wake up on linoleum, got a foot in the toilet.
I look over. Janis is at the kitchen table playing quarte against herself.
her insides are stronger than any bullet.
I'll tell you that much.
be honest-- would you be making the same decision if you didn't know this patient personally?
5-0 vicryl.
let me get this straight
you blacked out after five drinks, and they let you keep your badge?
that's... you know why?
because I'm always right about everything.
it's like the hand on mark's board.
trick or treat!
Hey, guys.
dig in, cowboy, princess.
a very cool costume.
And?
Hey!
it's my house, too.
you really should see a dentist.
my parents couldn't afford braces.
thanks for coming out tonight.
I love Halloween.
and, uh, I was worried about you.
it's good to see you out doing normal stuff.
Yeah, I think it's a good idea for all of us to start...
let's get going! - Okay.
paying a little bit more...watch her.
Hey!
stop! FBI! Stay where you are!
same hand, only this one's missing some fingers.
and, um, the other way.
that was the orientation on our assailant.
am I crazy, or does it look like it's pointing that way?
I just threw some toilet paper!
where did you get this mask?
99 cents store, man.
you're not gonna call my dad, are you?
Yeah, Nicole?
I'll be right there. - Makes sense.
you run an underground club, you want to make sure only the right people find it.
if the hand's positioning is the direction, why the missing fingers?
the last hand had three fingers, right?
we just drove three blocks.
that's it.
nice.
I'm sorry to bother you, but I tried Olivia first.
she's in surgery.
you did the right thing.
he came out of nowhere, and he had on this hospital bracelet that I was able to get off and call his dad.
he's on his way over.
I'm mark.
what's your name?
my name is Dylan.
my favorite book is "Harry Potter," prisoners of Azkaban.
my dad does magic.
okay, um, Dylan, does your dad know you're here?
this is my house, too.
no, Dylan, this is my house, and I'm trying to find out how you got here from the hospital.
go ahead. It's your house, too.
how did you know this address?
to our friends at 25696 sawyer court, "Los Angeles, California, 90024.
Hey, Dylan! - Hi, Charlie.
nuts to you, Squirrlio!
toot, toot!
what was that?
it's from the cartoon.
Charlie, do you-- do you know Dylan from school?
no, he's just my friend.
what?
hello.
I think my son is here.
Yeah, he's right here.
come on in.
Oh, my god. Are you all right?
he seems fine. - He just slipped out of the hospital.
I-I can't believe he'd just wander off.
um, thank you for taking such good care of him...Mr...
and I didn't catch your name.
this is my son Dylan.
wait.
are you somehow related to Olivia -- dr. Benford?
I'm her husband.
of-- of course.
that-- that makes perfect sense
your name being Benford, her name being Benford.
trick or treat!
Hey, honey.
you're her.
not yet.
you know, Charlie... Why don't we double check your candy in the kitchen?
Nicole, you want to come? - good idea.
what's going on?
I thought you might know.
Dylan came here.
Why?
this is my house, too.
it's your house, too, Dylan.
he keeps saying that.
Dylan is autistic the repetitive speech... - I don't need a diagnosis.
now I understand.
what?
why I made her-- Why I made you so
uncomfortable? - Yes.
okay, clearly, um, this is an unusual situation.
no kidding. - Mark, don't be like that.
I can make this comfortable for everybody.
you leave... you don't come back.
I'm very sorry if we've caused you any inconvenience.
thank you... both... for the kindness you've shown Dylan.
thank you.
it's my house, too.
good night, Olivia.
come on, Dylan.
let's go. - Good night, Dylan.
looks like the party's over.
definitely over.
this came from a friend of yours named Maya... worried about you.
you okay?
when I got shot...
the bullet... bounced around all over the place.
the only thing they said they could do without taking the whole thing out...
Olivia did this thing called a b-lynch.
but with all the scarring...
they said that it's gonna be almost impossible...
why am I crying?
I never even wanted to have a baby.
it's gonna be all right.
I can see why you like him. He's very charming.
I don't like M. Come on.
can you stop so we can actually talk about this?
I don't like him.
he's the father of one of my patients. - I know who he is.
what I want to know is how his son found his way here.
I have no idea.
Really?
Yeah.
well, I'm a little confused, because I thought you said you had Dylan moved off your rotation.
I did.
you did?
then why are you listed as the attending on his wristband?
Oh, god.
I had nothing to do with that. My boss made the decision.
your boss also tell you not to say anything about it?
no, I didn't say anything about it because I thought it would make a horrendous situation that much worse.
Oh, so you thought hiding it was a better plan.
that's not what was going on, mark.
don't turn me into someone I'm not.
don't you turn this around and make it about me.
the man you might be sleeping with in six months' time was just in our living room, and I sure as hell didn't bring him into our lives.
you did!
that's not fair.
just be honest.
just be honest.
have -- have you been talking to him at work?
Oh, come on!
come on, Mark.
have you done anything else I should know about?
mark, don't interrogate me.
then be honest with me!
I am!
are you being honest with me?
Oh, what are you talking about?
all the old patterns are back, mark.
you're out of the house all the time.
you're more and more secretive.
so I'm asking you the same thing that you asked me... be honest.
are you hiding anything from me?
in my flash-forward... I was drinking.
here we are again.
Olivia this isn't like before.
the lying's already started.
what?
no, it hasn't.
this isn't the same. Don't condemn me for something I haven't done yet.
did you even hear what you just said?
you've been punishing me this whole time for an imaginary relationship.
but when it comes back to you, you want to be let off the hook.
but our past together, mark-- all we've been through with your drinking... that's real.
that still hurts.
I'm not going through it again.
I promise you... I'm not gonna drink.
but it's not about the drinking.
you know that.
it's about trust.
it's about trust, and we don't trust each other anymore.
so, everything we said at the hospital today about only living in the moment, well... all that was a lie?
it's not a lie.
it's what I want.
I just don't know if it's possible anymore...
not now... not with us.
Hey, Demetri?
am I missing something?
I mean, on the same night our guy tries to kill Janis, he's hanging out here?
I don't know, but they found this on one of the bodies.
remember the Rutherford case?
we were talking about a case that I don't think even exists yet -- the Rutherford case.
it begins tonight.
all right.
it was quite a day, huh?
is it gonna be Halloween again tomorrow?
no.
just today.
good, 'cause it was kind of scary.
Yeah.
Yes, it was.
I'll see you in the morning.
thanks for coming to get me, daddy.
Oh, damn it, Simon. You scared me half to death.
did you ever take the train down the coast, Loyd?
breathtaking.
what do you want?
you disappear to Los Angeles.
you don't return my calls.
I'm worried about you.
we all are.
Yeah, well, I made it perfectly clear I don't want to see any of you right now.
I don't care.
we have to talk.
our experiment killed 20 million people, Simon.
what more is there to say?
tell me. - It's a girl.
you disappear to Los Angeles. You don't return my calls,
I'm worried about you. We all are.
I know when a man is willing to sacrifice anything for his cause, and you're not that kind of man, Agent Benford.
I need a favor... a big favor.
it's for Tracy.
Hi, Dad.
what I saw, what you saw, doesn't have to play out that way.
al, what are you talking about?
I found a way to change the game.
dear Celia,
I don't know your last name, and I don't know where you live, but I know you have two young boys...
twins, I believe.
and I know you didn't have a flash-forward.
they all saw FBI Agent Al Gough alive and well on April 29th.
what this guy apparently was trying to show us is we can't take what we saw for granted.
okay, bottom line is, this is a new world.
this is a new day, and I just think we need to take a moment and let that sink in.
what we need to have answered right now is the question, is there going to be another world blackout?
people are terrified. - Let's get back to the big question.
what big question? Do we have free will?
that's the big question?
possibly the central question of human existence for millennia.
if this is supposed to be your resignation...
you can forget it.
you're not even gonna let me explain myself?
you were attacked. You were shot.
you returned to duty to find out a coworker jumped off a building
am I in the right ballpark here?
my life's not making a whole lot of sense right now, and I think I need a little time off to figure it out.
totally understandable.
but, uh, I need you here
I know we've been shorthanded since the blackout.
but ever since Gough...
since Al...
this isn't about Al. - Yes, it is.
when I found out about what he did and why he did it,
it just really made me think about my own future.
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
do I lean into what I saw?
do I fight it?
what if my getting shot was...
I don't even know...
some... some sort of a sign that this baby's not meant to be?
you're gonna let a bullet decide whether or not you bring a baby into this world?
if Al's death proved anything, it's that our choices still matter, now more than ever.
well, I believe without reservation or recrimination that your card is the ace of spades.
well, that certainly answers that question.
I've been wondering how a Nobel Finalist and recipient of the Macarthur Prize spends his idle moments.
this isn't the time or the place, Simon.
you dropped off the radar, Lloyd.
without so much as a phone call,
I've had to check myself into the hospital to have my bruised ego X-rayed.
Hello, Dylan.
remember me?
why, this is not my pancake!
we're not having this discussion in front of my son.
Yeah, well, I'm done having you dictate when and where we talk.
Myhill forwarded me the e-mail you sent him.
or should I call it a suicide note? - It's the only logical move.
if you're hell-bent on self-destruction, then, yes, suppose it is.
but I still have doubts as to the cause of the blackout.
our experiment killed 20 million people, Simon.
20 million.
the world has been upended.
people need answers.
we have to go public and tell the world that we caused the blackout.
all right.
I guess we have to leave this room sometime.
no, no, no, no, no, no.
I have a reservation with the hotel that says different.
Oh.
plus you haven't opened your gift yet.
mm, what's this?
Oh...
just a little something to celebrate.
and what are we celebrating?
second chances, I guess...
and the fact that we can change the things we saw.
I never thought we couldn't, Mark.
it's the office.
I told them not to call unless it was an emergency.
I promise.
Yeah. - Hey, it's me.
this better be good, Dem.
Yeah, I'm sorry, man. Um, something came up.
did you bring your laptop? - Yeah.
I'm sending you some video we got from Barstow PD this morning.
remember when you had Marcie plug all the clues - off the Mosaic Board into NCIC? - You've got something?
Yeah. Barstow PD caught a homicide.
eyewitness managed to record it on her cell phone.
when it hit the system, NCIC kicked back a red flag.
Why?
stay tuned, man.
I'm headed back right now.
what do we have?
anything that might help us ID our tattooed friend? - Not really.
the victim, Neil Parofsky, is an aeronautics engineer.
who works out of a plant in Elsegundo.
watch and wallet were missing, so everybody's thinking robbery.
is that confirmed by whoever shot the cell phone video?
uh, Ingrid Alvarez.
Yeah, she saw Parofsky hand something over before he got shot, so she thought it was a mugging, too.
great.
first day back?
I should have gotten you flowers.
they're for your wife... - Oh.
for stitching me back together. And these are for you...
hard copy stills taken from that cell phone.
video forensics enhanced the images as best they could.
so now we just gotta figure out why someone would want to hit an engineer from Elsegundo.
have Vreede get into Parofsky's life...friends, family, bank accounts, whatever.
all right. What are we gonna do?
what was the name of that eyewitness? - Uh. Ingrid Alvarez.
we'll be talking to her.
if the guy in her video is one of the men I saw in my vision, this is our best lead so far... our only lead.
I'm putting him away now.
find out who sent him
and make sure he never shows up here on April 29th.
I'll sacrifice himself to prove we could change the future...
so let's change it.
Hey, honey.
everything okay?
Hey.
you're, uh, you're back early.
Yeah.
uh, Mark had a w... a work thing.
so what's going on here?
Oh, the usual.
you haven't been gone that long.
it's all right.
it's all right. It's all right.
it's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Tracy... - I'm sorry.
it's pathetic waking up every damn morning like this.
maybe if you'd just talk about it...
I told you.
I don't want to talk about it.
well, I'm not giving you a choice anymore.
I've been grieving for you for two years, Trace.
hell, I even had... had your grave exhumed two months ago because I was convinced that you were... you were alive.
if you want to keep hiding out here...
if you want me to pretend to the world, your Mom included, that you're still dead, you have to tell me what happened.
after what I saw in my flash-forward,
I'd believe anything at this point.
listen to me, Trace. Four months from now,
I'm gonna be sitting by your side in Afghanistan.
you saw it, and I saw it.
isn't that why you came home?
obviously at some point,
I'm gonna get involved, wh-whatever it is.
so let's just cut to the chase and get started.
we can do this, Trac
how about the Simcoe boy?
he was supposed to be discharged while I was gone. - Not yet.
he was complaining of calf pain, so we removed the cast, did a doppler, - and the kid's got a DVT - You're kidding me.
man, I'm going to be a grandmother before this boy goes home.
I don't get it. Why are you so anxious to get rid of him?
is it his dad... Mr. Simcoe?
what makes you say that?
just that you guys have a weird relationship.
I mean, every time he comes around, you get crazy tense...
and... - Dr. Benford?
uh, actually, Dr. Varney just told me about Dylan's status.
uh, what exactly are the ramifications...
would it be safe to leave the boy's bedside for a while?
I see here that you have him on heparin.
now the risk of complications at that dose - is relatively minimal. Is that correct? - I'm sorry. And you are?
a good question. - I'm a friend of the family. Frankly, I was hoping to bring Lloyd away from the hospital for a while...
steak dinner, some fraternal martinis.
do you think you could see fit to sanction that?
I mean, the boy is essentially ready to be discharged, if I've read his chart correctly.
may I?
uh, yeah. Barring any complications,
I see no reason why Dylan couldn't go home - in the next couple of days. - Well, it's settled then.
Lloyd, you've been absolved of any guilt, parental or otherwise.
lovely.
thank you very much for your help. - Mm-hmm.
of course. Dr. Varley.
nice legs.
are you sleeping with that woman?
that is none of your concern, Simon.
everything you do is my concern now, since you pressed "send" on that idiotic e-mail of yours...
which brings me to the purpose of my visit.
I'm going public with or without Myhill's cooperation or yours. - Good luck getting anyone to believe you without it.
good luck stopping me. - Well, it appears we're an impasse.
there are two ways to settle this.
the first is, oh, so tawdry and public.
I make a general annoyance out of myself, - kick over as many anthills as possible... - Enough, Simon.
or we settle this in a more... civilized manner.
define "civilized"
do you remember how we settled whose name would go first on the application for the Sloan Fellowship?
Texas hold'em, no holds barred.
you win, we go public, hang ourselves out to dry.
I win, you keep your mouth shut and your guilt in check, - and we buy ourselves some more time. - You want to wager the fate of millions of people on the outcome of a poker game?
the gods did it all the time... dice, chess, whatever took their fancy.
they loved tinkering with the lives of those mere mortals. - We're not gods, Simon.
20 million deaths on our shoulders.
isn't that what you said?
if that doesn't qualify us for godhood, tell me what does.
let the games begin.
Hey, what's Barstow PD doing here?
let's hope 3-star guy didn't get to our witness.
do you think she drives a gold sedan?
maybe not anymore.
special agent Benford, FBI.
detective Rick Malchiodi, Barstow PD
we think your victim might be an eyewitness in a homicide.
that's a hell of a coincidence. - How's that?
her roommate said she witnessed a homicide, too.
her roommate?
Yeah. Uh, Alvarez...
came home from work, found her roommate there double tapped to the side of her head.
so looks like they got the wrong roommate, huh?
I believe it's to you.
how much do you want to give me this round?
I hope you don't drag this game out as long as the last one.
when you lose, you'll be able to console yourself that I've prevented you from confessing to a mass murder.
manchester figure of speech.
2500. I'll call.
I don't understand.
you're saying they killed Blanca, - but they were trying to kill me? - That's what it looks like to us, yes.
and it's because of what happened in the alley?
now, Ingrid, what exactly did happen in the alley?
we have the video, but it would really help us to get your account.
I was working late, me and one of my clerks.
can't say I see you as a blonde, Ms. Alvarez. - And I can't see you as a rock star, - but that's what you say your vision was. - I was locking up for the night.
you want me to walk you to your car?
I mean, it's kind of late. - I'll be fine.
I went to my car, but there were men in the alley...
three of them. They were fighting, arguing, but I couldn't hear what about.
but when it got physical, I hid.
I called 911, but they put me on hold.
I still can't believe I stayed calm enough to think to use my phone.
my hand was shaking so much.
now you told the police the victim gave the other men something right before they shot him?
they were arguing about a case or something.
but I didn't see what it was.
what about the faces of the other men?
do you think you could describe them? - I didn't get a right look, but I think one of them maybe had gray hair.
the other one was bald, and he was big, muscular.
it was very dark.
we're gonna sit you down with a sketch artist, all right?
whatever you can give us, and if there's anything else you can remember, it could be a big help, okay?
as they were walking away, they were talking about something.
uh, it sounded like "QED
thank you.
you guys ever read about that inevitability index thing that's been in all the papers?
it's a scam...
some entrepreneurial huckster's attempt to sell us on the idea that the odds of the future happening can be "calculated."
it's all rubbish. Fate is fate.
we're not responsible, Lloyd.
what about free will? - No such thing.
Oh, since when did you become such a hard determinist?
simple quantum suicide theory.
I will win this hand and every subsequent hand we play ad infinitum. QED
don't you get tired of hearing yourself pontificate?
don't you get tired of being a self righteous prig.
we're scientists, Lloyd, not attention seeking reality show contestants looking for their 15 minutes of fame on a talk show.
you always do this. - What's that?
use intellectual argument to defend your behavior. - What?
okay, so you sleep with Cabrini's wife, and you call it electromagnetism.
you fire your assistant and blame it on Darwin. - Shut up, Lloyd.
and now you've upended the entire world, - and you hide behind determinist rhetoric. - You're not the only one who's lost someone, Lloyd.
Oh, who, Simon? Who have you ever cared about?
I'll call.
you see, I knew you were bluffing this entire time.
you know why?
because there's no such thing as luck or fate or "there but for the grace of god."
this game is pointless. I've already won.
the future's already happened.
fighting it is futile.
Hey, Nicole.
Hey. You okay?
sorry.
I'm mind wandered.
I'm guessing Mark told you what I saw.
he did, yeah,
but only because he's worried about you.
we both are.
you don't have to be. I'm gonna be fine.
the future can change. It's all over the news.
Hey, crazy huge floral delivery for the quintuplets.
can you give me a hand?
go, go, go.
don't worry, Olivia. You know, we can change what we saw,
just like we could before the blackout.
everything's back to being up to us again.
dad.
my humvee got attacked.
Yeah.
your friend Mike told me that.
but that was two years ago, Tracy.
why didn't you go back to your base?
I couldn't. The attack...
we were fired on by supposed friendlies.
Marines?
Jericho PMC... Private Military Contractors.
Yeah, I've heard about them, but that doesn't explain why.
Jericho works for the military, - Which means that I can't trust the military... - Whoa, hold on a second.
Why，why would you say you can't trust the military?
about two weeks before my Humvee was attacked,
I was working long range recon
on this village in the foothills near Kunar.
I was alone.
orders were to stay covert so the locals wouldn't see me.
but there must have been someone else out there.
and I watched them...
I watched as they wiped out a village.
they killed women, and they butchered children.
they slaughtered them.
Why? Why would they want to do that?
I don't know, but I told my superior officer,
and about a week later, Mike and I pulled duty
at a forward roadblock near the Kalikata Mountains.
out of nowhere, a Haji truck breached our roadblock.
we took off after them.
Damn!
embrace the suck, Stark?
who the hell are these men?
those are Hajis!
burro, Burro! We're gonna get whacked!
get out!
I don't know how I survived.
I thought I was the only one.
what's been going on?
you sounded a little freaked when you called.
did you slip or something? - No, no, no, no.
just, uh, I, uh...
look, I didn't believe it myself.
I took this picture at my house.
Oh... My... God.
it's Tracy.
how? - How?
my Tracy would kill me if she knew I was talking to you, but she was... she was in a Humvee with three other soldiers.
it got blown to hell, a bloody mess...
body parts everywhere, including her leg.
the DNA... - Right.
it got basically thrown into the mix. - Then where has she...
Wh... what has she been doing for the past two years?
this is what I need to talk to you about.
basically, she's been on the run.
she saw something she shouldn't have - and got int in trouble with Jericho. They're this... - Yeah, military contractors.
Yeah. They were ones who attacked her.
I... I know this sounds like something out of a Baldacci novel or something,
but... Tracy was dead, and now she's alive.
so I, uh, I really need your help, Mark.
cause Tracy is scared to death of these Jericho guys, and I'm afraid they're gonna try to find her.
you're alright?
Yeah.
I saw something today, and it got me thinking that if this person's future could come true...
and it did, even though it seemed impossible...
then maybe these visions are more set in stone than we thought.
or maybe we have to work that much harder.
you're right.
you're right.
Hey, did you open my gift?
Oh. They're lovely.
you didn't put 'em on?
I figured you'd just take 'em right off again.
right.
we can change things, Mark.
we just have to decide how badly we want to,
how far we're willing to go to make it happen.
but I say there's nothing, nothing that we shouldn't be willing to do for one another.
so what are you suggesting?
set a trap for our suspects, draw 'em out.
I know a lot's changed lately, but we still don't use civilians as bait.
Ingrid knows the risks.
then work the case. Work... work the... the Parofsky angle.
we've been doing that.
Parofsky was chief engineer at micro-circadian electronics.
he was recently let go on suspicion of corporate espionage.
what if Parofsky is selling his work to the highest bidder?
Ingrid did say that they took a package from him right before they shot him.
so whatever was in there was valuable enough to kill for.
look, Stan, it's a real lead. Ingrid's gonna be protected - on this, I promise. - What makes you so sure they'd try to hit her tonight?
they already tried to kill Ingrid once.
if we get the word out that we're releasing her from custody, they might try again.
why do you say that?
we went to Utah. D. Gibbons knew we were coming.
you unearthed the somalia photos.
five minutes later we're getting shot at.
whoever we're investigating knows what we're doing before we do it.
you think we've got a mole.
we... have a mole.
two men with assault rifles are gonna get into this building five months from now, and someone's gonna let 'em in.
we catch these guys tonight, we can finally put a face on our enemy.
careful, it's hot.
guess there's no chance of getting any bourbon in there.
probably not a good one, no.
when did you start drinkin' whiskey, anyway?
I told Mark Benford.
you what?
he can help. - Are you insane?
you don't know these people, dad.
I gotta get out of here. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on a second.
I came to this house specifically because I thought
that I'd be safe, but I see now that that was a big mistake.
mark's a fed, Trace. I mean, he's... He's practically family.
the second that Jericho knows that I'm still alive, they'll find me, and they'll kill me.
that's not true. Don't you remember your flash-forward?
the fact that you even had one proves that you're gonna be alive.
I was with you. I... I gave you my pocket knife.
you were on a cot, fell asleep.
we were in some kind of bunker or cave surrounded by guards, and there was graffiti all over the walls.
I think somebody was calling my name.
then I stepped outside.
there was a man out there.
he was very concerned about you.
he said something strange... - The account has been verified.
then I gave him an envelope,
but I don't know what was in it.
the accounts have been verified.
does that mean something to you?
no. But this guy, what did... what did he look like?
tall, dark. Scar.
khamir Dejan. He was a field medic with the IMC
he... he took care of me.
he... he got me back together.
that's why I left.
I was so afraid that Jericho would kill Khamir to get to me.
that's not gonna happen. Five months from now he's alive.
I saw him. All three of us were there, Trace.
how can you be so sure that everything we saw - will still come true? - Enough of mine has come true already
that I'm a believer. You came back to me, trace.
didn't you?
I don't know what could drag us both back to Afghanistan,
but I have to trust what I saw.
everything looks good out here.
Roger that.
all units, stay on tact-2.
these guys are pros...
former military, based on that video we saw.
Ingrid, you have a lot of amazing birds.
my babies... the only real family I've ever had.
each one of them is special to me.
it's hard to believe I ever thought of giving them up. - What do you mean?
my flash-forward.
in my vision, I wasn't working at the store anymore.
I had blonde hair, and I was living in New York.
so the next day, I put it up for sale.
well, since we're standing here,
I'm guessing you didn't have a lot of buyers.
it was all for the best.
I don't know what I was thinking...
planning on changing my life for a future that might not even come true.
we keeping you awake, cupcake?
I'm sorry, man.
I was up late with Zoey last night. - Oh?
I told her what happens to me...
what's gonna happen to me... supposed to happen to me.
she wants me to quit, get out of the line of fire, I guess.
are you... thinking about it?
I wasn't.
I mean, who knows? I quit, I get hit by a bus, right?
that's my luck. Whatever, right?
what am I supposed to do, become a barista until my date with death?
that's one way to go.
when this is over, whether it's tonight or later,
I'd like for you to have one of my cockatiels.
Oh, no, no.
a thank you gift. Don't make me insist.
Ingrid, if you truly love your birds,
you're not gonna want to give one to me, but thank you.
that's very sweet.
what was that? - Stay here.
Sabre-2, this is sabre-1.
Sabre-2, go.
think I may have some movement here.
you want us to move in on your position?
could be nothing. Let me check it out first.
Sabre-2, we have a breach.
Sabre-2... all units, surround the perimeter! Nobody gets out!
mark, I got Ingrid covered in the back.
Freeze! - Mark!
you saw him turning on me.
he was makin' a move.
it was dark.
I didn't get a good look.
but I do know we can't interrogate a dead man.
what does this all mean? - I'm sorry,
but one of the men you saw is still out there, and he's not gonna stop until he finds you.
we need to put you in witness protection.
that's okay.
I think that's my future.
I should have trusted my gut all along.
judging from your dwindling amount of chips, the pain is almost over.
what are you thinking over there, mate?
maybe you got a pair of 8s, working a full boat.
how much do you have left?
just under 15.
thank you.
why don't we make this hand winner take all?
if you win, we go public.
but of course I'll win, and you'll keep your mouth shut. - Fine.
as a physicist, Lloyd, you really are a genius.
but you were never very good at concealing your tells.
Ouch.
four of a kind for Mr. Camp.
straight flush.
pot and game to Mr. Simcoe. Congratulations.
keep the chips.
call it a tip.
I got what I came for.
how did you beat me?
did I tell you Dylan really loves magic?
sleight of hand's his favorite.
there are some things even I won't leave to chance.
that being said, I'll let you have the first pass at drafting the announcement, all right?
thanks for backing my play there.
I just want to make sure I know which play it was.
is this about taking tattoo man off the streets - or putting him under it? -What the hell are you talking about?
look, I know you said if we get this guy, - we might be able to change our futures. - But?
look, I just want to make sure the plan here isn't to kill him so he can't kill me or come after you in your office.
whatever gave you that idea?
because I had it.
the second you suggested tattoo man might be the guy who's supposed to kill me,
I thought, I'm gonna kill him first.
but now you think I actually did...
that I went that far.
I would've.
what are you doing here so late?
trusting my gut.
hmm.
your e-mail said you had something for me.
Yeah, I do.
NSA Finally sent back
a new rendering of that suspect zero photo.
hmm. Looks like the old one.
it is. This... is the new one.
what's that on his hand?
it looks like a ring.
Mm-hmm. Can the image be enhanced any further?
NSA Is working on it right now,
but it took them this long to get this far.
tell them to put their foot on the gas.
if we can tie this jewelry to the guy wearing it, we'll have our first workable lead.
good job.
Hey.
Wow. You look like you had a perfectly ordinary day.
worse than ordinary?
I killed a man tonight.
what happened?
I had a shot at changing my future...
changing our future...
and I took it.
Oh, Mark.
come here.
come here.
maybe April 29th's just gonna be another day at the office now.
what does that mean?
I, uh...
I told you in my flash-forward I was in danger, right?
a man was trying to kill me.
but tonight...
I got to him first.
I changed the future, Livy.
we have a second chance.
we have a second chance.
Hey.
you have them?
there were supposed to be seven.
after the first atom bomb test,
you know what a colleague of Oppenheimer's said?
what a foul and awesome display.
he then added, "now we are all sons of bitches.
the bullet ripped up my insides.
they said that it's gonna be almost impossible -For me to get pregnant.
you will be shot three times.
you, agent benford, you will kill agent noh on March 15th
with the very gun I assume you're carrying right now.
we need to talk about what I saw.
it wasn't our wedding. It was his funeral.
we can do more than wish. We can change the future.
my therapist gave me this drug to unlock the parts
of my flash-forward I couldn't remember.
we were talking on the phone together.
now it's time for you to tell me everything.
mosaic is bigger than you.
you're just a-a tiny speck, mark.
agent VOGEL HAS OFFICIALLY JOINED THE MOSAIC TASK FORCE.
if YOU WANT TO AVOID BEING KILLED, YOU'RE GONNA NEED
corporal MIKE WILLINGHAM. I WAS IN TRACY'S CONVOY
when IT WAS ATTACKED. I CAN'T HAVE YOU DRINKIN' HERE.
it JUST DOESN'T WORK FOR ME. FINE. I'LL GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.
visitation RIGHTS WILL BE OVER IN FIVE MINUTES.
have YOU BEEN GOING TO MEETINGS? EVERY TUESDAY AND THURSDAY.
and YOU'VE BEEN STAYING OUT OF TROUBLE?
you HAVEN'T BEEN FIGHTING?
you KNOW ME, TRACY. I KEEP MY HEAD DOWN.
it's GONNA HAPPEN, DAD. YOU'RE GONNA GET PAROLED.
they JUST CAN'T SAY NO THIS TIME.
transfer GUARD CALL IS TO THE MAIN GATE.
I'm GONNA MAKE THIS UP TO YOU, TRACE,

she's CUTE.
girls THAT AGE... THEY'RE IN FULL BLOOM.
not QUITE SURE WHAT TO DO WITH THEIR NEW CURVES YET, THOUGH.
and YOUR DAUGHTER
she's GOT THAT LOOK IN HER EYE.
don't YOU EVER, EVER TALK ABOUT MY--UHH!
get OFF! GET HIM OFF.
I'm GOOD, THANKS.
what ARE YOU DOING HERE?
you SAID I COULDN'T DRINK AT HOME.
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR THIS, BUT TRUST ME.
I've BEEN SITTING EXACTLY WHERE YOU'RE SITTING RIGHT NOW.
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.
please JUST SPARE ME THE A. A. TALK, DAD.
you HAVE NO IDEA.
and WHAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT TO COME IN HERE
we CAN TALK ABOUT THIS AS MUCH OR AS LITTLE AS YOU WANT.
but LET ME JUST ASK YOU ONE QUESTION
before YOU SHUT ME OUT AGAIN.
if YOU'RE SO SCARED THESE JERICHO GUYS
are AFTER YOU,
and I FOUND YOU BY WALKING INTO THE CLOSEST BAR
do YOU REALLY THINK THIS IS A SMART MOVE HERE?
do YOU?
mark IS GOING TO SHOOT YOU? HE IS NOT GOING TO SHOOT ME.
you JUST SAID THAT WOMAN IN HONG KONG SAW A REPORT
armed MEN GUARD THIS WOMAN WHILE SHE EATS DINNER, ALL RIGHT?
babe, SHE'S SHADY.
yet SHE STILL KNOWS THE SERIAL NUMBER TO MARK'S GUN.
that DOESN'T MEAN HE'S GOING TO BE THE ONE
please, DON'T--DON'T--DON'T GET ALL LAWYER-Y ON ME HERE.
all RIGHT? MARK IS THE ONE WHO WENT HALFWAY ACROSS THE WORLD.
he RISKED HIS LIFE, ALL TO FIND OUT WHO MIGHT KILL ME.
babe... HE'S NOT THE GUY.
all RIGHT?
it WAS YOUR MEMORIAL.
I FIGURED IT OUT, DEM.
what WAS HAPPENING ON THE BEACH...
it WASN'T OUR WEDDING THAT I SAW.
baby, IT WAS YOUR MEMORIAL.
it DOESN'T MATTER.
I FILED THE PAPERWORK TO DESTROY THE GUN.
it's ALREADY IN THE EVIDENCE LOCKER.
everything's GONNA BE FINE. EVERYTHING IS GONNA BE FINE.
come HERE.
you GOTTA TRUST ME.
okay?
I'm GONNA MARRY YOU.
not GETTING OUT OF IT.
we NEED TO TALK.
all RIGHT. COME ON IN.
hypothetically, MARK.
hypothetically.
come ON. EVEN I COULD COME UP WITH A SCENARIO
where I'D WANT TO KILL DEMETRI. LOOK, NO MATTER
I'd NEVER HURT DEMETRI. BUT WHAT IF DEMETRI'S GOT A GUN TO YOUR HEAD?
he's ABOUT TO PULL THE TRIGGER. TO SAVE YOUR OWN LIFE,
do YOU SHOOT HIM? COME ON.
do YOU KILL HIM, MARK? I KNOW YOU LOVE DEMETRI,
but I THINK YOU MAY WANT TO REEL IT IN THERE, ZOEY.
so THE QUESTION BECOMES,
what COULD YOU POSSIBLY DO WHERE DEMETRI WOULD WANT YOU DEAD?
do YOU HAVE SOME DEEP, DARK SECRET
worth KILLING SOMEONE OVER? NO.
then WHAT AM I MISSING HERE, MARK? WELL, HERE'S A THEORY
someone AT THE BUREAU'S BEEN LEAKING INFORMATION,
putting A LOT OF US IN DANGER. NOW I DON'T THINK DEMETRI'S
the GUY, BUT IF HE WAS-- WELL...
I'm SORRY.
I THOUGHT WE WERE PLAYING "OUTRAGEOUS ACCUSATIONS.
go TO HELL, MARK.
are YOU MR. AARON STARK?
the COMMANDANT OF THE MARINE CORPS
has ENTRUSTED ME TO EXPRESS
I WAS A MARINE RECON. I KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE.
when AND HOW?
Mr. STARK-- WHEN AND HOW?
two DAYS AGO,
near KUNAR PROVINCE.
your DAUGHTER'S UNIT ENCOUNTERED THE ENEMY.
a ROCKET-PROPELLED GRENADE HIT HER HUMVEE.
I KNOW THEY'RE GONNA SEND A LETTER.
we're DONE.
is THAT WHAT I THINK IT IS?
grilled PEANUT BUTTER AND BANANA SANDWICHES.
best THING IN THE WORLD FOR A HANGOVER.
I ALWAYS THOUGHT YOU MADE IT 'CAUSE I LIKED IT.
two BIRDS, ONE STONE.
Tracy, THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED TO ASK YOU.
the NAME JAMES ERSKINE RING ANY BELLS?
no. SHOULD IT? I HAD MARK DO SOME DIGGING.
turns OUT THIS JERICHO OUTFIT
they've GOT BRANCHES ALL OVER THE WORLD,
but THEY'RE HEADQUARTERED OUT IN SANTA MONICA.
ERSKINE'S HEAD OF OPERATIONS.
mark ALSO DID A BACKGROUND CHECK ON YOUR C. O.
Musgrove? IS HE DIRTY?
lieutenant PAUL MUSGROVE WAS KILLED
in A HELICOPTER CRASH TWO DAYS AFTER YOUR SUPPOSED "DEATH.
please TELL ME YOU DON'T THINK THAT'S A COINCIDENCE. NO, I DON'T.
and I GOT A BUDDY AT THE PENTAGON-- DAD, PLEASE.
I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING, BUT THIS IS
this IS OUT OF CONTROL.
I SHOULD'VE NEVER LISTENED TO KHAMIR. WHAT'S HE GOT
when JERICHO STARTED LOOKING FOR ME AGAIN
after THE BLACKOUT, I KNEW THAT I HAD TO LEAVE,
that IT WASN'T SAFE FOR ANYONE TO BE AROUND ME.
a HUMANITARIAN RELIEF PLANE LANDED NEAR OUR VILLAGE.
they WERE HEADED BACK TO THE U. S. AND THEY HAD ROOM
for ME ONBOARD, SO THEY HID ME IN THEIR CARGO HOLD.
khamir SAID THAT IT WAS A SIGN-- IT'S ALL PART OF MY DESTINY
that I WAS SUPPOSED TO COME BACK HERE
and BRING YOU BACK TO AFGHANISTAN.
what AN IDIOT I'VE BEEN. AREN'T YOU BEING A LITTLE HARD ON YOURSELF HERE?
no. ONCE I GOT BACK HERE, AND I ACTUALLY SAW YOU,
the THOUGHT OF BRINGING YOU BACK TO THAT HELLHOLE,
to A PLACE WHERE YOU COULD GET KILLED
I COULDN'T LIVE WITH MYSELF
if ANYTHING BAD HAPPENED TO YOU, DAD.
don't WORRY, SWEETHEART. I'M GONNA BE OKAY,
and SO ARE YOU.
trust ME.
trust ME.
so DO YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN
why YOU BROUGHT ME IN HERE AGAIN?
april 29th.
we WERE ON THE PHONE TOGETHER.
remember?
a LOT OF THINGS CAME UP ON THAT CALL
the NAME D. GIBBONS, SOME INITIALS--Q. E.D.
Oh, AND THE FACT THAT THERE'S GONNA BE ANOTHER BLACKOUT.
you DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT ANY OF THAT?
no?
we HAVE A SKETCH.
we DON'T KNOW WHO HE IS.
but AROUND THE TIME OF THE BLACKOUT,
he WAS HAPPILY CLONING CREDIT CARDS.
he ASSUMED THE IDENTITY OF SOMEONE NAMED D. GIBBONS.
based ON OUR CALL, YOU SEEM TO KNOW HIM.
I DON'T.
no?
no, I DON'T.
okay. YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO PLAY PISSY BRIT WITH YOU.
let's TAKE A WALK.
lunch?
I WAS IN THE AREA. I THOUGHT I'D BRING YOU A LITTLE SOMETHING.
Oh, THANKS, HONEY. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT. WELL, SHE DID,
there's NO WAY YOU'RE GONNA FINISH THAT WHOLE THING. DON'T WORRY, STAN.
I BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING EVEN MORE DELICIOUS. HMM?
I FILED A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT REQUEST
on EVERYTHING THIS OFFICE HAS ON THE MOSAIC INVESTIGATION. YOU DID WHAT?
if THERE'S EVEN ONE WORD IN THERE THAT WILL KEEP YOU SAFE,
I HAVE TO-- THIS IS MY OFFICE, OKAY?
you DON'T JUST COME IN HERE AND SERVE MY BOSS PAPERS.
I'm NOT GONNA STOP
until WE'RE ON THAT BEACH TOGETHER.
somebody BETTER START MAKING SOME SENSE REAL SOON. IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE, ACTUALLY.
I'm GOING TO BE REVIEWING ALL OF YOUR MOSAIC-RELATED FILES. I'M SORRY, STAN. SHE'S GOING
is THIS ABOUT MARK'S GUN?
please TELL ME THAT'S NOT WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. MOSAIC'S THE SUBJECT
of WIDESPREAD NATIONAL MEDIA ATTENTION,
which IS PRECISELY THE TYPE OF ISSUE WHICH QUALIFIES
for EXPEDITED PROCESSING UNDER F. O.I. A.
tell SOMEBODY WHO CARES.
can I RECOMMEND YOU START WITH A JUDGE?
cause THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
I'm OPENING UP CLASSIFIED FILES TO YOU. YEP, WE COULD DO IT THAT WAY,
but GOING INTO COURT-- IT'S PUBLIC,
and I'M GUESSING THAT "PUBLIC
is NOT GOING TO HELP YOUR INVESTIGATION MUCH.
agent NOH WILL MAKE THE FILES AVAILABLE FOR YOU TO REVIEW.
thank YOU.
Mike! HOW'S EVERYTHING?
can't COMPLAIN. LIKE MY DAD SAYS, IF ALL MY PROBLEMS
could BE SOLVED WITH MONEY, I'M DOING GOOD, RIGHT?
how ARE YOU HOLDING UP?
couldn't BE BETTER. COULD NOT BE BETTER.
that's SO GREAT TO HEAR. I THINK I KNOW WHY.
I GOT A CALL LAST WEEK. IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY.
blocked NUMBER.
person ON THE OTHER END OF THE LINE DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING,
but THEY DON'T HANG UP, EITHER.
we JUST SIT ON THE PHONE IN SILENCE.
suddenly, IT HITS ME...
it's TRACY.
she's ALIVE, ISN'T SHE?
she's AT MY HOUSE RIGHT NOW.
can YOU BELIEVE THAT? IT'S COME TRUE.
it's COME TRUE.
what ARE WE DOING HERE?
you're GONNA TAKE ME THROUGH EVERYTHING YOU SAW...
you've GOT TO BE JOKING. AND WHERE YOU SAW IT.
we WERE ON THE PHONE TOGETHER. YOU HEARD EVERYTHING I SAID.
but I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU SAID IT
or WHAT YOU SAW DURING THE REST OF YOUR VISION, FOR THAT MATTER.
so IF YOU WANT TO HELP ME STOP ANOTHER BLACKOUT FROM HAPPENING,
or EVEN IF YOU DON'T, YOU'RE STILL GONNA WALK ME THROUGH IT.
you GOT THAT?
so LET'S MOVE IT.
this DOESN'T BOTHER YOU?
start AT THE BEGINNING.
I GOT A TEXT MESSAGE.
I WAS GETTING UP FROM THE BED.
I WAS--I'M SORRY, ARE THESE DETAILS REALLY NECESSARY?
do YOU THINK I WANT TO HEAR 'EM?
I NOTICED THAT I HAD A TEXT MESSAGE ON MY PHONE.
it WAS FROM SIMON. IT WAS A FORMULA, OR PART OF A FORMULA.
I'm NOT SURE. I HAD IT WRITTEN OUT HERE ON THE--ON THE MIRROR.
the MIRROR?
uh, YEAH. I USED LIPSTICK.
look, I HAD A SENSE THERE WAS A WOMAN IN THE ROOM,
but I SWEAR TO GOD, I HAD NO IDEA IT WAS OLIVIA.
the NEXT THING I DID WAS DIAL A NUMBER.
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS YOURS. YOU SAID IT WASN'T A GOOD TIME.
I ASKED IF YOU'D BEEN DRINKING. YOU DIDN'T TAKE THAT VERY WELL.
go to hell, Lloyd. WE NEED TO TALK.
about WHAT? THE Q. E.D.
on THE PHONE CALL, YOU SAID YOU WERE CLOSE
to CRACKING THE Q. E.D. YEAH, IT'S LATIN. IT MEANS
that WHICH WAS TO BE DEMONSTRATED.
could BE, BUT COULD BE Q. E.D.
quantum ELECTRODYNAMICS.
actually, WAIT, NO. NO?
well, I SAID "THE Q. E.D.
you WOULDN'T PUT A DEFINITE ARTICLE IN FRONT
but, WELL, YOU WOULD PUT IT IN FRONT OF A FORMULA. THE ONE ON THE MIRROR?
Absolutely.
sorry TO KEEP YOU WAITING, MISS HAWK.
um, IS THERE ANYTHING IN HERE ABOUT PRIOR MEDICAL HISTORIES?
we NEED TO DISCUSS A COUPLE OF THINGS
before WE GO ANY FURTHER.
I HAVE A LETTER HERE FROM YOUR OBSTETRICIAN.
the INJURY THAT YOU SUSTAINED WHEN YOU WERE SHOT
makes PREGNANCY UNLIKELY FOR YOU.
your O. B. THINKS IT'S TOO SOON TO PURSUE THIS,
and FRANKLY, I AGREE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU AGREE?
I THINK WE HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF SUCCEEDING IF WE WAIT.
okay.
in MY FLASH-FORWARD, I SAW THAT I WAS PREGNANT.
I WAS INTO MY SECOND TRIMESTER,
which MEANS...
I HAVE TO GET PREGNANT NOW. I'M WORRIED YOU'RE NOT THINKING
this WHOLE THING THROUGH. WELL, YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT THAT,
because I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT THIS.
I KNOW THAT THERE ARE RISKS INVOLVED,
but NO AMOUNT OF RESEARCH OR STATISTICS
is GONNA CHANGE THE FACT THAT I WANT THAT BABY
not A DIFFERENT BABY TWO YEARS FROM NOW
when I'M MORE SURE ABOUT MY LIFE OR WHATEVER.
I WANT THIS SPECIFIC CHILD.
this IS MY BABY.
thank YOU.
I TOLD YOU TO DROP THIS.
no, YOU TOLD ME TO TRUST YOU, AND I DO. THEN DROP IT.
I've ALREADY FOUND SOMETHING IN ALDA HERTZOG'S DEPOSITION
that MAY HELP US. DROP IT.
what IF IT WERE ME?
what IF I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING?
would YOU LISTEN IF I TOLD YOU TO STOP?
fine.
you WANT TO DIG, YOU KEEP DIGGING.
but SERVING MY BOSS WITH PAPERS,
trying TO SMEAR MY PARTNER
that IS WAY THE HELL OVER THE LINE.
I'm GOING TO DO WHATEVER I CAN TO PREVENT YOUR MURDER.
sweetheart, I'M HOME.
somethin' BURNING?
what?
Tracy, WHERE ARE YOU?
she's ALIVE, ISN'T SHE?
as WE SPOKE, I WALKED DOWN THE STAIRS.
by THEN I WAS, UH, STANDING HERE.
I-I HEARD A LITTLE GIRL'S VOICE.
I PRESUME THAT WAS YOUR DAUGHTER.
go AHEAD. IT'S YOUR HOUSE, TOO.
she WENT INTO THE KITCHEN WITH DYLAN. YOU STARTED EXPLAINING
well, IT'S ONLY THEORETICAL, BUT I'M CLOSE TO CRACKING IT.
you NEED TO HURRY. THERE'S GONNA BE ANOTHER BLACKOUT.
I HUNG UP. I SAT DOWN ON THE COUCH.
the LAST THING I REMEMBER WAS THAT I HEARD A VOICE... HEY, HONEY.
before I COULD SEE WHO IT WAS,
I WOKE UP ON THE FLOOR AT N. L.A. P. WAIT. YOU SKIPPED SOMETHING.
why WERE YOU SO ADAMANT WHEN YOU STARTED TALKING
about D. GIBBONS? THE MAN YOU CALL D. GIBBONS LIED TO YOU.
I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW HIM. I DIDN'T ASK IF YOU KNEW HIM.
I ASKED, WHY WERE YOU SO ADAMANT?
I DON'T KNOW.
you KNOW THIS MAN-- NOT IN THE FUTURE.
right NOW. WELL, I DON'T.
I WAS ANGRY BECAUSE I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH SOME DRUNK. YOU CALLED ME.
I WAS IMPORTANT TO WHAT WAS GOING ON.
you're NOT TELLING ME EVERYTHING. I DON'T KNOW ANY D. GIBBONS.
you SAID D. GIBBONS WAS A LIAR. HE IS A LIAR!
so YOU DO KNOW HIM.
Hey, MIKE. I'VE BEEN TRYING TO REACH YOU. WHAT'S UP?
I TALKED TO JACK. HE SAID YOU WERE MOVIN'?
Yes, SIR. MY OLD MAN GOT ME A JOB CLOSER TO HOME.
can't SAY NO TO FAMILY, RIGHT?
good ON YOU.
nothing MORE IMPORTANT THAN FAMILY.
I'm GLAD I CAUGHT YOU.
what DO YOU SAY? LET ME BUY YOU A BURGER BEFORE YOU TAKE OFF.
come ON. COME ON. ALL RIGHT, A QUICK BITE.
did YOU KNOW I WENT TO PRISON?
you SERIOUS?
two AND A HALF YEARS.
got INTO A BAR FIGHT,
hit A GUY A LITTLE TOO HARD.
damn. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT, AARON.
where IS THIS PLACE?
tell YOU ONE THING-- PRISON, ESPECIALLY WHERE I WAS,
it CHANGES YOU-- MAKES YOU A CAPABLE MAN.
capable OF WHAT?
anything. EVERYTHING.
you FEEL LIKE AN ANIMAL.
guess YOU DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO, RIGHT?
exactly. THAT'S WHAT I THINK. BUT THE TRICK, MIKE,
is LEAVING THAT ANIMAL INSIDE ONCE THEY LET YOU OUT.
that ANIMAL'S GOT NO PLACE IN THE WORLD.
I've WORKED REAL HARD TO KEEP HIM LOCKED UP.
but YOU KNOW WHAT?
today I'M GONNA LET HIM OUT.
where IS SHE, MIKE?
Where's MY DAUGHTER? I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!
I KNOW YOU TIPPED OFF JERICHO! AAH!
Where'd THEY TAKE HER, MIKE? DUDE, I DON'T--AAH!
Where'd THEY TAKE HER, MIKE?
you BREAK AN ARM LIKE THIS, IT NEVER HEALS RIGHT. YOU'RE GONNA
you FIRST!
everything's OUT OF CONTROL AT WORK.
you KNOW, WEDECK'S NOT TALKING TO ME. WHY NOT?
ambushed HIM WITH F. O.I. A. PAPERS.
she THINKS ALDA HAS SOME INFORMATION ABOUT MY MURDER.
that's CRAZY.
it's LIKE SHE'S ACTING LIKE SHE LOVES YOU OR SOMETHING.
all RIGHT, JANIS.
where WERE YOU TODAY, BY THE WAY?
I WAS AT A FERTILITY CLINIC.
okay.
Wow. YEAH, I KNOW.
I PRACTICALLY HAD TO BEG THEM TO TAKE ME ON AS A CLIENT.
did THEY?
Yeah.
all RIGHT.
I PUSHED PRETTY HARD.
but I HAVE TO CONCEIVE THIS BABY NEXT WEEK
to MATCH WHAT I SAW.
next WEEK?
Oh, WELL, THAT'S... THAT'S GREAT.
that's GREAT.
aren't YOU, UH,
aren't YOU SCARED, THOUGH
the WHOLE MOM THING
I MEAN, WITH OUR LINE OF WORK AND ALL?
Yeah, I KNOW, BUT THAT'S KIND OF MY POINT.
I DON'T WANT MY LIFE TO JUST BE ABOUT BEING AN FBI AGENT.
and IF I WANT THAT LIFE, I HAVE TO START LIVING IT RIGHT NOW.
when I GOT SHOT AND I WAS LYING THERE: LISTENING FOR THE AMBULANCE,
the ONLY THING I COULD THINK ABOUT WAS THAT BABY
and THE POSSIBILITY THAT I WOULDN'T GET TO HAVE HER,
that I WOULD MISS DRESSING HER IN PINK...
that I WOULD NEVER GET TO BRUSH HER HAIR.
broke MY HEART.
Janis, DON'T GET ME WRONG HERE, BUT...
she DOESN'T EXIST YET.
Yes, SHE DOES.
I KNOW SHE DOES.
she's OUT THERE MAKING HER WAY TOWARD ME.
I've SPENT ALMOST EVERY WAKING MOMENT
thinking ABOUT WHO SHE'S GONNA BE.
I CAN'T WAIT TO MEET HER.
you're GONNA BE AN AWESOME MOM.
Thanks, DEM.
we BOTH HAVE TO FIGHT FOR THE FUTURES WE WANT.
get RID OF THAT GUN.
the MAN YOU CALL D. GIBBONS-- HIS REAL NAME IS DYSON FROST.
how'd YOU KNOW HIM? I HEARD HIM GIVE A LECTURE
on THE WAVE STRUCTURE OF MATTER ONCE.
he WAS ON SABBATICAL AT OXFORD.
I WAS DOING RESEARCH ON WAVE MECHANICS,
and I HAD TO SIT THERE AND LISTEN TO HIM TAKE CREDIT...
for WORK I'D DONE BUT HADN'T PUBLISHED YET.
I MEAN, IT WAS INDISPUTABLY MINE, BUT I HAD NO WAY OF
proving HE'D GOT HIS HANDS ON IT. BASTARD. SO D. GIBBONS IS A LIAR.
some TIME AFTER I READ HIS OBITUARY,
I REMEMBER THINKING, "GOOD RIDDANCE.
but OBVIOUSLY, HE'S STILL ALIVE.
and AT SOME POINT ASSUMED THE IDENTITY OF "D. GIBBONS.
Charlie SAID, "D. GIBBONS IS A BAD MAN.
I THOUGHT MAYBE...
you SAID IT TO HER...
in YOUR VISION.
no, I DIDN'T.
you HAVEN'T ASKED HER ABOUT IT?
I've TRIED.
she's SHUT DOWN.
well, IT SEEMS I'M NOT THE ONLY PERSON YOU NEED TO TALK TO.
these MEN WHO KIDNAPPED YOU-- DID THEY TELL YOU
why THEY TOOK YOU, WHAT THEY WANTED?
was IT REVENGE?
okay, SO THEY TORTURE YOU FOR 48 HOURS,
cut OFF YOUR FRIEND'S FINGER-- YET THEY NEVER TOLD YOU WHY,
made ANY DEMANDS, THREATENED YOU IN ANY WAY?
they DIDN'T THREATEN ME.
they THREATENED DYLAN.
lying TO ME WON'T KEEP HIM SAFE. TALKING TO ME WILL.
I GAVE THEM EVERYTHING...
energy LEVELS, EQUIPMENT SETTINGS,
monitoring PARAMETERS.
could THEY USE ANY OF IT TO CAUSE ANOTHER BLACKOUT?
that's WHAT I'M AFRAID OF,
especially AFTER WHAT I SAID TO YOU IN MY VISION.
this GUY...
he's THE KEY.
we FIND HIM, MAYBE WE CAN STOP THIS THING FROM HAPPENING AGAIN.
I NEED YOUR HELP, LLOYD.
I'll DO WHATEVER I CAN.
I GOT SOME INTERESTING INFORMATION FROM LLOYD ABOUT DYSON FROST, ALSO KNOWN AS D. GIBBONS.
according TO SIMCOE, DYSON FROST WROTE THIS SEMINAL PAPER ABOUT SOMETHING CALLED "THE MIRROR TEST." WHAT THE HELL
it's A TEST THAT DETERMINES RECOGNITION OF CONSCIOUSNESS
among SPECIES-- HUMANS, ELEPHANTS, CROWS.
crows... SOMALIA?
everything POINTS TO IT, STAN. THE CROW DIE OFF IN SOMALIA.
we FOUND TOWERS IN THE SATELLITE PHOTOS.
we NEED TO BE THERE.
I SPOKE TO A TEAM LEADER AT RED PANDA.
they FLY IN AND OUT ALL THE TIME SAFELY.
bird-watching IN SOMALIA?
how AM I GONNA SELL THAT TO WASHINGTON?
you DON'T.
it's ALWAYS BETTER TO BEG FOR FORGIVENESS
than ASK FOR PERMISSION.
this is Mark. Leave it here. I'll get back to you.
mark, it's me. Some serious stuff has gone down, and I need you to run a background check on that guy James Erskine, the head of Jericho.
get back to me as soon as you can.
Thanks, buddy. Appreciate it. JAMES, IS SHE READY FOR THE CAKE?
we're ALL SET.
what THE HELL?
James ERSKINE? YES?
good AFTERNOON, SIR.
I'm WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER.
computer IS TELLING ME WE'VE GOT SOME SURGES
affecting SOME HOUSES. DO YOU MIND IF I TAKE A LOOK AT THE MAIN LINE OUT BACK? TAKE A LOOK. I NEED YOU TO GET IT FIXED.
we NEED THE POWER TURNED ON. COME ON.
we're THROWING A BIRTHDAY PARTY HERE,
and IT'S LIKE THE MIDDLE AGES.
good AFTERNOON, MISS HERTZOG.
do I KNOW YOU?
I'm ZOEY ANDATA.
you MET MY FIANC? DEMETRI NOH.
remind ME TO SEND YOU A CONDOLENCE CARD
in A COUPLE MONTHS. YOU CAN SEND ME A WEDDING PRESENT INSTEAD.
nothing's GONNA HAPPEN TO DEMETRI.
all PROGNOSTIC EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY. OH, WE'VE ALREADY SEEN THAT
and I THINK YOU'RE GONNA HELP ME CHANGE IT.
I've BEEN GOING OVER THE TRANSCRIPTS
of YOUR INTERROGATION, AND I THINK YOU KNOW MORE
than YOU'VE TOLD THE FBI,
and I THINK THAT WHAT YOU DO KNOW
is SOMEHOW RELATED TO DEMETRI'S DEATH. AND YOU THINK I'D GIVE UP
because I'M A BELIEVER IN TRUE LOVE? MA'AM, IF YOU LET ME
the ONLY THING YOU NEED TO BELIEVE IN
is ATTORNEY/CLIENT PRIVILEGE. RIGHT. A FED'S GIRLFRIEND IS GOING TO EXONERATE ME.
let ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.
in YOUR FLASH-FORWARD,
were YOU IN PRISON?
so ARE YOU GONNA FIX THIS THING ALREADY,
or DO I HAVE TO CALL SOMEBODY ELSE?
I'm NOT HERE TO FIX YOUR POWER.
what?
I'm HERE TO GET MY DAUGHTER BACK.
look, I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE OR WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
I KNOW YOU TOOK HER.
now YOU'RE GONNA GIVE HER BACK.
daddy, WHEN ARE THEY GONNA FIX THE POWER?
soon, BABY. SOON. I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
okay.
I CAN'T GIVE YOU YOUR DAUGHTER BACK.
then WE GO TO WAR.
I CAN'T BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHO SHE IS
or WHAT THE HELL YOU'RE TALKIN' ABOUT.
and IF THAT MEANS WE'RE AT WAR, THEN WE'RE AT WAR.
but IF THIS IS YOUR OPENING SALVO, BUDDY,
I'd CONSIDER SURRENDERING.
you KNOW THE GUYS YOU REALLY GOTTA BE AFRAID OF?
the ONES WHO GOT NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE.
I UNDERSTAND... BUT YOU'RE STAYING HERE.
and IT ISN'T BECAUSE YOU'RE IRRATIONAL, ERRATIC
and FREQUENTLY STUPID.
it's BECAUSE YOU'RE ESSENTIAL. I DON'T LIKE YOU,
but, UH, I NEED YOU. LISTEN, JANIS, DEMETRI
if THEY DON'T MAKE IT BACK, IT'S A TRAGEDY.
but IF YOU DON'T, IT'S A CATASTROPHE.
the TRUTH IS, MARK, OUR ENTIRE INVESTIGATION
hinges ON WHAT'S IN YOUR HEAD.
and I'M HERE TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T LOSE IT BEFORE APRIL 29th.
but IN HONG KONG, YOU SAID MOSAIC WAS BIGGER THAN ME.
I LIED. I'M CIA. I DO THAT.
and THAT'S WHY NO ONE TRUSTS YOU FOLK.
Yeah, I DON'T NEED 'EM TO TRUST ME, MARK.
I JUST NEED THEM TO DO WHAT I SAY.
you're STAYING HERE.
yeah?
it's ME. JUST HAD A VISIT FROM THE FATHER.
you're kidding me. I thought your guy-- what's his name?
willingham, sir.
Yeah--Willingham. I thought he was gonna keep an eye on him.
he was. We ended the surveillance this week.
you want the dad taken off the board? THE PACKAGE IS SECURE, RIGHT?
so make sure she stays alive. Yeah, it arrived in Kandahar this morning.
then GET RID OF THE FATHER.
daddy? GOTTA GO. IT'S MY TURN IN THE BOUNCE HOUSE.
here I COME, BABY.
Kandahar.
they're CALLING YOU TO KILL ME, MIKEY.
too BAD YOU GOT PLACES TO BE.
you PEOPLE WITH THE FBI FOUND OUT ABOUT SOMALIA.
as CIA, I CAN GET US THERE.
that's WHAT BEING A JOINT TASK FORCE IS ALL ABOUT.
now YOU KNOW THE DEAL-- GANWAR REGION, 1991
crows FELL FROM THE SKY. THERE WERE ANECDOTAL REPORTS
of A MASS LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS.
archived SATELLITE PHOTOS SHOW FIVE TOWERS
running A PERIMETER AROUND THE VILLAGE IN QUESTION.
one OF THOSE TOWERS REMAINS STANDING.
our GOAL IS TO ACCESS THAT TOWER AND DETERMINE
if AND HOW A BLACKOUT OCCURRED.
are WE USING MARK'S RED PANDA PLAN?
no. MARK WANTED TO WORK WITH RED PANDA.
we're GOING AS RED PANDA. THAT VIOLATES ABOUT A DOZEN INTERNATIONAL TREATIES.
are YOU SURE WE WANT TO GO DOWN THAT ROAD?
this IS INTERNATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, AGENT HAWK
CIA JURISDICTION. IT'S MY BALL TO CALL. GREAT. WHEN DO WE LEAVE?
when WE LEAVE IS CLASSIFIED.
the TOWER YOU'RE INVESTIGATING IS BASED ON MY DESIGNS
designs THAT WERE STOLEN FROM ME WHEN I WAS 13 YEARS OLD.
our PLAN IS TO DOCUMENT
the SITE EXTENSIVELY FOR YOUR REVIEW.
you CAN'T DOCUMENT SOMETHING YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
you NEED ME ON-SITE. YOU SHOWED ME THE TOWERS
because YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE.
I WAS THE ONE WHO TOLD YOU. DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT SOMALIA?
mm, A BIT DRY. GORGEOUS BEACHES.
it's A FAILED STATE.
they HAVEN'T HAD A FUNCTIONING GOVERNMENT SINCE 1991.
Oh, I SAW "BLACK HAWK DOWN." I GET IT.
the FACT IS, YOU CAN'T MAKE SENSE OF THE TOWER WITHOUT ME,
and YOU KNOW IT.
learn IT, COVER TO COVER. MM-HMM.
and STOP BY MEDICAL AND GET YOUR SHOTS
cholera, TYPHUS AND TEN OTHER BUGS YOU NEVER HEARD OF.
just BE WARNED, WE WILL BE OFF THE RESERVATION.
so IF THINGS GO SIDEWAYS, THERE IS NO CAVALRY.
see YOU ON THE TARMAC.
Hey.
came TO TAKE YOU HOME.
it's BEEN A LONG DAY. NOT FINISHED HERE YET.
Oh, YOU'RE FINISHED. I SAY YOU'RE FINISHED.
let's GO HOME.
you, UM...
you WANT TO TELL ME WHAT THAT WAS ALL ABOUT?
it WAS ABOUT DOING EVERYTHING THAT I CAN
to MAKE SURE YOU'RE ON THAT BEACH WITH ME
on OUR WEDDING DAY.
I NEEDED THOSE FILES BECAUSE...
I'm REPRESENTING ALDA HERTZOG.
you're WHAT?
she HAS INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR DEATH,
and I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT IS. SO I MADE A DEAL WITH HER. OH, MY...
I GET HER A HEARING. SHE GIVES ME THE DETAILS. SHE IS A TERRORIST, ZOEY!
a SUSPECTED TERRORIST, DEM, WITH INFORMATION THAT MIGHT SAVE THE LIFE OF THE MAN THAT I LOVE, SO-- I CAN'T BELIEVE
baby, I WOULD DO ANYTHING-- ANYTHING.
if I THOUGHT IT COULD SAVE YOUR LIFE, I'D DO ANYTHING.
I'm SCARED.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO DIE.
baby, I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU, TOO.
okay.
okay. OKAY.
I LOVE YOU.
come WITH ME.
there's SOMETHING I GOTTA TAKE CARE OF.
this is Mark. Leave it here. I'll get back to you.
mark, JUST CALLING TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THINGS
have ESCALATED A LITTLE BIT WITH TRACY'S... FRIENDS.
but IT'S OKAY.
I'm GOOD.
things ARE HAPPENING JUST THE WAY THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO.
whoa, BUTTERCREAM FROSTING. IRINA, THIS CAKE IS OUTSTANDING.
I'm GONNA BE GOING OFF THE GRID FOR A LITTLE WHILE.
if YOU NEED ME... SORRY, MAN.
take HER OUT OF HERE. THESE PEOPLE WENT TOO FAR,
and I'M NOT GONNA LAY DOWN.
it's MY TIME TO MAKE A MOVE.
I'm IN THIS THING ALL THE WAY TO THE END.
how'd YOU FIND ME?
I'll ALWAYS FIND YOU, KIDDO.
so LONG, BUDDY.
it's A SERVICE WEAPON, FORMERLY BELONGING TO AGENT MARK BENFORD.
serial NUMBER A-5-6-1-9-8-4.
that's THE ONE. I'LL BRING IT RIGHT OUT.
Thanks. AND, DEMETRI?
yeah? I HAVE A BLOWTORCH IF YOU WANT.
Thanks, MAN. ALL RIGHT.
figured I'D JUST RENT A BOAT AND THROW IT OUT
in THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN,
but, UM, THE THOUGHT OF WATCHING IT MELT... NOT BAD.
I'm SORRY.
I CAN BE A LITTLE...
confrontational AT TIMES.
you?
no.
it's ONE OF THE THINGS YOU LOVE ABOUT ME THOUGH, RIGHT?
it IS. IT'S RIGHT UP THERE WITH CLIPPING THE TOENAILS IN BED.
jerk. COME ON.
yeah?
it's GONE.
what ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
the BOX IS HERE. THE SLIP IS HERE.
but THE GUN IS GONE.
on the ddd eee fff ggg hhh iii jjj kkk lll mmm nnn ooo ppp qqq
ganwar rrr uuu vvv yyy " SO...
I was baking bread.
bread! YES!
and-- and you?
I was water-skiing.
good FOR YOU.
Hey, I thought this weekend " vogel's little field trip kind of closed the window on that.
got that one?
I want a gun.
it's not happening.
going into somalia without a gun is like going scuba diving without an oxygen tank.
you're here in an advisory role.
they're here to back us up.
I suggest you stick close to 'em.
let's get to the tower and get out of here.
come IN.
what is that?
the hydra-- seven heads, bad breath, killed by hercules.
why am I looking at it?
Gibbons-- dyson frost-- simcoe gave us his name.
here's the rest of the story.
brilliant, reclusive particle physicist, minored in victorian lit.
an achiever. - Typical story
domineering father, ly spoke to him in french even though they grew up in wyoming.
became a chess grand master at 15.
the chess piece you found in pigeon.
the white queen.
apparently, he still plays, which is weird considering he was killed in a boating accident in 1990
on a boat called "les monstre deboisteau
boisteau's monster.
who's boisteau? - PIERRE BOISTEAU-- 18th CENTURY FRENCH WRITER.
he had illustrations of monsters in some of his books.
among the more well-known
the hydra.
the HYDRA. ON MY BOARD ON THE 29th.
it's all leading back to frost.
somehow, he's even part of charlie's vision.
Charlie saw him?
Gibbons is a bad man.
D. gibbons is a bad man.
that's all I've been able to get out of her.
meanwhile, everything we know about him is coming to a head, and all we've got are blind alleys and cryptic messas.
what the hell am I supposed to do with that?
be like hercules and slay the beast.
keep looking for dyson frost.
there it is.
keep movin'.
it's not so bad here. A bit sleepy.
a little hotter than I expected.
AWAALE, WE NEED YOU TO TRANSLATE.
tell them we're aid workers with red panda resources, a relief organization, protected under articles 59 through 63 of the geneva convention.
he have a right to humanitarian access.
my name is abdikalif.
I speak english.
you don't need him anymore.
I know you. I saw you on al jazeera telling the world you caused the blackout.
always nice to meet a fan.
you did not cause this. godcaused this.
he merely put your finger on the button.
we ARE EMPLOYEES...
of red panda.
we're on a relief mission to deliver cholera kits.
this man is not a relief worker.
we were having mechanical problems.
okay, now if you just let us continue on to our destination
do not lie to me!
thiswas your destination.
you arrived at your destination.
just like the others.
what others?
the foreigne came to our village and told us they would bring us electricity.
they said five towers would provide power until the end of time, that it was a humanitarian act.
but those towers were not for electricity.
they were for something else, something not humanitarian.
I had gone out to tend the goats.
I was not away long, only a few moments.
everything.
what happened
it made no sense.
I felt afraid.
they were gone.
Hooyo! hooyo! Hooyo! Hooyo!
but it was all part of god's plan
this I learned from my mother
everything in this life happens for a purpose.
and before the hand of death could take hold .
I ran.
let me go! come on. I'm just the pilot!
that man, for instance, is here for a purpose.
and now he has served it.
you are here for a reason, and I will kill you
all of you
if you do not tell me what that reason is.
Oh, DAMN.
I'm-- i'm so sorry.
it's not a big deal. are you okay?
a little light reading?
I like the pictures.
Seriously? orgo?
okay, um, just shut upfor a second.
I'm thinking about possibly-- - thinking about possibly what?
I'm trying outa pre-med class.
so that's the big secret?
well, I don't want peopleto know about it because it's really hard, and I don't want themto see me fall on my
that's very funny. thank you.
no, seriously, that's-- that's the most difficult thing about becoming a doctor, is picking the right name.
I mean, take me, for instance. MY REAL NAMEIS MARTIN GOATHEAD.
you're AN IDIOT.
really. MARTIN GOATHEAD.
Yeah, I think I like"bryce varley" better.
Ah, of course you do. it sounds rugged.
it's, like, a guythat eats protein bars
promise me you won'ttell anybody, please.
Nicole, I WOULDN'T DO THATTO YOU.
are you sureyou're all right?
Oh, look at you. diagnosingpatients already?
I'm fine.
look, uh, I gotta run, dr. kirby.
Dr. goathead.
why DON'T WE JUSTTELL 'EM WHO WE Are and why we're here we're not breaking cover.
Hey, he's not buyingthe red panda bit, and I'm not gonna sit aroundwaiting for a bullet in my head.
right. 'CAUSE YOU'REWAITING FOR THREE To the chest.
What'd you say? - You heard me.
it doesn't matter if it happenshere or your couch or in the arms ofyour soon-to-be widow.
let's face it. you're done.
thought WE SAID NOT THE FACE.
my Ball to call.
let's get to the chopper, get the guns, neutralize abdi's men, then we interrogate 'em.
let's MOVE.
. . you might get that gun.
all RIGHT,
now ONCE WE START Firing, take .
fire.
let's move! Go, go, go!
come on.
Simon. come on.
here THEY Come!
what the hell is that?
fire!
they failed me. But you will not.
you will fulfill your part of the plan.
honey?
Hey! LUNCH IS READY!
that's right. - In denver.
it's where we could go-- denver.
MMN of the omelet.
it's ONE HELL OF AN OMELET.
but seriously, I mean, I've been doing some research.
there's two major hospitals in denver, and they both need surgeons, and the fbi has a division in denver.
so this is why we're having lunch.
well, that, and I wanted to see your beautiful face.
the mile-high city.
I could join the ski police,.
.
me by the fire YOU WRAPPED UP IN A VEGAN TIGER SKIN...
nothing on underneath.
doesn't sound so bad.
look, I mean, i-- you know, we don't have to make any decisions right now, but I think we should soon.
Hey, there's, um, something I wanted to talk to you about, too
something we haven't been talki about.
Charlie, what she saw-- we need to know.
Livy, we've needed to know for a while now.
I thought we said we were gonna give her time.
but if she knows something, something that can help this investigation, well, what is it you think that she knows?
there are things in this investigation that keep coming back.
Mm-hmm, he's at the center of everything.
I kept thinking I could do this without involving our family, we can't deny this anymore.
listen, i-i have people at the fbi office
I want to take charlie down there tomorrow and just see if maybe
can you let me talk to her first?
you can take her, but can I try talking to her first?
okay.
this isn't beyond us, mark.
I know.
will you take a look at this stuff?
you know, it is one hell of an omelet.
on this continent, a child dies every six seconds from malnutrition.
your country could easily provide this food, yet it does not.
that's not true.
every year, we send hundreds of millions of dollars in aid just to have it stolen by people like you.
people who live in heaven shouldn't judge those who live in hell.
tell me who you people are, or I will kill him.
SOD off.
who are you? Tell me.
they are cia, here to investigate the tower.
we are security.
this is your security?
so you are with cia.
I've gotten used to it.
what do you want with that tower?
why have you brought the scientist here?
we THINK WHAT HAPPENED ON OCTOBER 6th, THE Da of the blackt, happened before on a smaller scale in your village because of the towers.
no. I came back from herding the goats.
I saw them on the ground. they were dead.
it was no blackout.
I saw the black camel.
black camel's considered a bad omen here.
death is a black camel that kneels at every man's gate.
. . were... dead.
I returned from the refugee camps changed, a man now.
the bodies of my people were gone, and all that remained was a village of ghosts.
and there was only one tower left.
word spread that I had lived when others had died, and for this, I became feared.
I used this fear and became what I am now.
God's plan.
and then the day of the blackout,
I was making a speech.
when again touched by the better angels of our nation.
2
I spoke as a conqueror, my enemies crushed
God's plan.
I'm not willing to wait one day longer!
there will be one more war in this land-- my war.
I will rule this country.
. . . will win.
and you will help, because you are cia.
you can get me these things
planes, tanks, boats-- what I will need to win my war.
that's not gonna happen.
planes, tanks, boats!
you will get me these things!
no, no, no, no!
it happens every six seconds.
Vogel, just make the call.
the request alone will tell our people what's going on.
I'm not going to make the call because no one's going to pick up the call.
it's like I told you before
there is no cavalry.
there's gotta be some options here.
that's it? we just die?
you saw yourself alive on APRIL 29th.
and that lunatic actually saw himself "better
better angels.
which will it be?
Quaad.
wait. get off him!
which will it be?
which will it be?
your prophecy is wrong!
what you saw-- it isn't what you saw, and I can prove it to you.
I know about the better angels.
you say you know about the better angels.
tell me what you know.
it's from abraham lincoln's inaugural address.
Lincoln was-- - your president. ended slavery.
he was strong, not afraid to crush his enemies.
we were fighting a civil war in our country, just like your country.
better angels" was a speech about unity, you do not know what I saw.
no, I don't, but I think I might be able to find someone who did.
can you get on the internet here?
we created a web site where people can come on and share their prophecies with each other.
a man was at the assembly of the african union at a peace conference.
you were speaking.
how do you know what this man says is true?
you tell me. look, they know your name.
they say you were wearing a wire necklace with an amber bead surrounded by two red ones.
do you have something like that?
but my mother did.
Hooyo! Hooyo!
I haven't seen that necklace or my mother since I was a boy.
someone else says they saw you
said that you were quoting lincoln
to every living heart and hearthstone ALL OVER THIS BROAD LAND...
will yet swell the chorus of the union .
you don't need tanks or guns.
it's not possible.
it's what she heard.
2 " that's why she's been so frightened to tell us.
she's afraid her daddy's gonna die.
that's not gonna happen, olivia.
on APRIL 29th, I'M GONNA BE IN MY OFFICE At my board, alive.
Livy, whatever charlie saw, what she said
Oh, god. it's not that.
Thenhat is it?
this is the part where i tell you that we could escape this.
we could go anywhere and get away from it all, get away from all of this.
and this is the part where you tell me that you won't.
right.
there's gonna be another blackout.
and I have to see this through.
I have to try and stop it.
I HAVE TO TRY.
what happened to the world happened in your village first.
at least, that's our operating theory.
they were blacked out.
they had prophecies?
that's what we think.
we had hoped to find some of them and talk to them.
the people, my mother
I saw the black camel.
I thought the devil had taken their souls.
the koran-- chapter 66verse 6.
save yourself and your families
I painted it myself as a warning.
in all my time, I haven't been in there.
devil or no, it is an evil place.
but there is one thing that can push a man more than fear.
what's that?
destiny.
you look like you've seen a ghost.
it's entirely the opposite.
what I designed was theoretical.
it could only be done in the future, and yet it's been standing here for 18 years.
welcome to the future.
you said these designs were stolen from you?
this was built in '91, but you didn't come up with the concept till '92.
I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT'S POSSIBLE.
someone must have invented it before you.
no. this is exactly what I designed.
whoever did this, why would they leave it behind for somebody to find?
then why didn't they ever come back to finish?
the war hasn't stopped.
found something.
it's a chessboard.
it's been sitting here for 18 years.
and WE HAVE PORTABLE POWER.
here's to hoping.
what DID YOU SEE?
I knew this boy.
he was my friend.
What'd he say?
he said he saw himself playing a game.
and DID IT HAPPEN?
he said what he saw came true.
what DID YOU SEE?
this is my mother.
she was looking for me.
e couldn't find me, but she had hope.
she knew I would survive,.
I would become great.
the preceding interviews from test group "b" confirm that the subjects uniformly experienced a consciousness shift two weeks into the future.
that's the man who shot at us in utah.
that's d. gibbons
in 1991?
conducting AN EXPERIMENT.
you see?
God didn't have anything to do with this.
this was man.
over HERE!
what are you seeing, simon?
this tunnel
vacuum systems, the lead shielding
it's a linear accelerator, one of five.
smaller, less powerful versions than the ones we use at n. l.a. p.
they ran a pimeter around the village.
somehow they unleashed a tachyon burst, creating a beta test of the global blackout you weren't in the village at the time the experiment was conducted, which explains why you didn't lose consciousness.
if what you're saying is true, it took five accelerators to creatthis beta blackout.
there's no way that just one knocked out the entire world, right?
how can you possibly say that?
technology moves fast, agent noh.
even if you knew the rules, which you don't,
I don't think they apply anymore.
I got something down here!
ready? Go.
I don't think your people were driven off by the war.
they were shot
executed, all of them.
remote village, wartime.
given all the unrest, they knew nobody they showed them tomorrow and ripped it away.
you said God has nothing to do with these.
Hooyo! hooyo!
that it was man.
but it was not any man.
it was you.
no. those plans were stolenfrom me.
I said you were sent here for a reason.
now I know what that reason is.
God DELIVERED YOU TO ME... - ABDI, NO!
let your end mark a new beginning!
No!
Oh, MY GOD.
his vision.
this wasn't supposed to happen.
you want some cookies to go with that milk?
no.
I want to leave.
I want to go away with you and with charlie.
I just want to get away from all of this, from everything that we saw.
yes or no?
yes or no?
you want to say both, don't you?
you can't have it both ways.
this IS WHAT WE SIGNED ON For.
you save lives.
I save lives.
this is howe do it.
you're at your office.
I'm here with charlie hearing you've died.
I ve you, mark. that doesn't work for me.
this IS HOW IT HAPPENS. - DON'T Say that.
you see, you need things to play out like you saw.
you want them to. you need to.
you're forgetting there's another part to .
the part where we're not together anymore.
Livy, I DON'T WANT THAT.
you can't have it both ways.
yes or no?
Hey.
Oh, where'd you get that?
abdi's men.
brutalized his people, but they were too scared to say anything because destiny said he was their leader.
we changed their destiny today.
rum?
to yet another flash-forward never coming true.
you okay?
Yeah, fine.
so what? I don't have a baby. who cares?
you can still have a baby, right?
Yeah, but I can't have willa.
you named her.
Willa?
that's nice.
well, I would have.
it was supposed to happen this weekend.
SHS never gonna get here.
God.
what?
it's SO STUPID.
I just saw a mass grave, and all I can think about is a mythical baby.
you're having a circle of life moment, right?
you know, the weekend's not over.
I'm just saying, if it's baby-making you need,
I will take one for the team.
okay, first of all, no offense, but that's kind of gross.
what? - Second of all, that's, like, 1,000% wrong.
desperate times.
I'm gay.
I WILL MAKE YOU YER.
Oh, yeah?
what about zoey?
I'm not gonna be around in a couple of months, okay?
I think it'd be nice if willa was.
are you serious?
how the hell did you get that?
I fixed their satellite tv.
I know you think that I can't handle wpons,.
I was killing a man.
how many fingers did you have?
enough to do the job.
what about you?
what didyousee?
okay.
mark benford is dead.
I was doing my job.
are you doing?
I promised our little snowboarder that if he held still for his x-ray,
I'd get him a hundred packets of graham crackers.
you know, I've raided every floor, you are so very good at this.
what?
listening to people, you know, figuring out what they need
uh, BRIBING THEM WITH BAKED GOODS.
it's gonna make you a really good doctor one day.
well, I can ace graham crackers.
it's organic chemistry I'm worried about.
uh, here.
this is for you.
calculator? - Oh, oh, that's not just any calculator.
no, I bought that my junior year at duke right before I miraculously passed a physics final, and, um, EVER SINCE THEN
M. C.A. T.s, MED SCHOOL, Board exams, that's
that's been my good luck charm.
this is great.
up until today, my good luck charm was a brainy smurf.
you really think I can do this, huh?
you're not just saying that to be nice?
well, I don't lie, and I'm not nice.
psychiatry, huh?
like you said, I'm a good listener.
plus I'm kind of an expert when it comes to dealing with people with problems.
so 12 years from now, when I finish my training, we'll be able to work together.
12 Years?
well, you'll probably be head of the department by then.
uh, nicole...
I-I lied to you.
what do you mean?
I told you that everything was fine with me.
it's not.
12 Years from now, I'm not so sure that I'm gonna be around.
the preceding interviews from test group "b" confirm that the subjects uniformly experienced a consciousness shift two weeks into the future.
what are you doing?
couldn't sleep.
just packing up stuff to take back to the bureau.
that all?
no.
thinking, little things
life, death, fate.
careful not to ponder too much.
the ancient greeks did it all the time
well, all of them wound up dead.
what the hell?
Hello, demetri.
my name is dyson frost, and I'm recording this message in 1991.
got your attention, didn't i?
we believe that this man was somehow connected to the blackout.
he's highly efficient in advanced computing equipment.
he also seems to have a penchant for chess.
the man you call D. Gibbons-- his real name is Dyson Frost.
Hello, Demetri.
my name is Dyson Frost.
got your attention, didn't I?
in my flash-forward, I saw this symbol.
I remember the images, but I just can't put them together.
your have to find her, Bryce.
our entire investigation hinges on what's in your head.
I'm here to make sure you don't lose it before April 29th.
we went to Utah. - Officedown!
D. Gibbons know we're coming.
you unearthed the Solia photos.
five minutes later, we're getting shot at.
whoever we're investigating knows what we're doing before we do it.
we have them all.
you're forgetting there's another part to what we saw
the part where we're not together.
Hey, honey.
I want to go away with you and with Charlie.
I just want to get away from all of this.
yes or No?
Thanks.
Hey, I'm sorry. I was in surgery.
Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine.
Oh, god. What happened?
um, I ran into a bullet.
babe, I'm serious.
6 inches this way, this bullet's in your heart.
I know.
I'm not sure I can handle this anymore.
Livy, I was an FBI agent when you married me.
but it is different now. We have a daughter.
I mean, if something happens to you, I... I don't wanna...
look, I get that this is who you are.
but it--it's different.
I-I mean, I've got to know that our family comes first.
something's gotta change.
Wedeck offered me a position on the DHS Counterterrorism Task Force.
it's an improvement?
uh... It's surveillance. Two guys in a car eating burritos,
listening to phone calls in Farsi.
I'll be out of the line of fire.
my biggest concerns will be boredom and cholesterol.
you're gonna hate that.
mm, but I can take it.
what I can't take is losing you and Charlie.
our family will always come first. I promise.
so, um, if you need anything, I'll be staying at the Wedecks'.
I'm sorry. I have no idea how to do this.
neither do I.
she's been in there 20 minutes.
I'll call you tonight.
are you my new partner?
if you are, I insist you change your clothes.
can't catch bad guys in pajamas.
where are you going?
I'm just going to the Wedecks' for a little while.
how long is a little while?
well, I... hope it's not very long at all.
what's this?
you lost your bracelet.
it'll keep you safe from the bad guys until you come back home.
let me put it back on.
come here.
I love you so much, Charlie-bear.
if you're watching this message in 2010, that means the global blackout was successful.
that also means we've had a near miss in pigeon, Utah.
how do I know all this?
because I myself have had hundreds of flash-forwards.
in nearly all of my futures, I end up dying on March 15th-- Like you, Demetri.
so if you managed to find this tape in Somalia,
it would seem our fates are on a collision course,
and the possible outcomes of the game are rapidly narrowing.
as for the end game, the next move is Mark Benford's.
that's Dyson Frost?
and it's genuine?
Yeah. It's legit.
degradation rate in the magnetic tape plus the date of production makes it authentic.
the only explanation, however implausible,
is that Frost flashed-forward from 1991 to our present and saw us in Somalia.
then in 1991, he makes a tape he knows we'd find.
that's a 19-year flash-forward.
and March 15th--the day he dies in his future...
is the date I'm supposed to be murdered.
maybe that's the collision course he's talking about.
dem, Frost talks about narrowing outcomes
another indication that what people see in their flash-forwards... are only possibilities.
could be warning us.
warning us about what?
there's gonna be another blackout.
what?
how? When?
we have to assume that's agent Benford's next move-- To find out and to prevent it.
so let's make it a good one.
find Dyson Frost... Yesterday.
this is magnificent work.
master circuits built from basic sketches I designed when I was 13.
well, when you finish patting yourself on the back, can we get to work?
I had to go to a lot of trouble to get all this,
not to mention what I had to go through in that basement.
Yes, I know--the missing dig.
a terrible loss.
you find anything in those documents we got in Somalia?
Yeah, um, a couple of things.
there were several references to Tachyonic Dark Matter.
in '91? How is that possible?
well, the theoretical basis existed.
but the experiment failed.
because they needed us.
well, clearly, you're missing the silver ling.
the blackout
we're off the hook. Not our fault.
frost flash-forwarded in '91 using technology that did not develop.
Simon, Flosso said our N.L.P. experiments amplified the blackout.
we can't dodge that.
find anything else interesting?
I saw this formula in my flash-forward... Written on a mirror.
it's the exact inverse of some of our early N.L.A.P.Computations.
I don't know--maybe a process to reverse the blackout?
you're working on blackout protection in your flash-forward?
I don't know, but it was this formula, and there was...
there was more of it written on the mirror, and the two of them are combined somehow.
well, we need the other formula that you saw on the Benfords' mirror.
go see your girl friend.
ticktock.
nothing. I ran face recognition software on every available database.
since Frost faked his death in 1990, There is not one record--not one sighting of this guy.
nothing. - He's a thorough guy...
likes complex things like chess.
he's also got an arrogant streak-- Likes people to know when he's winning.
I've been looking through membership lists of chess clubs pre -'90.
frost placed third in an amateur league in '87.
and the guy he beat lives in san Francisco.
his name is Ian Mckinnon.
mckinnon was the reigning champion until Frost beat him in an upset.
so I traced him and then I gave him a call.
but when I mentioned Frost, he hung up.
well, let's travel.
we need to get to San Francisco and talk to him, right?
Yeah. But first, there's something else.
this is Frost's final tournament against Mckinnon.
he uses a very risky play called the Queen Sacrifice.
looks like a total Hail Mary, But it's one of the most effective plays in the game.
okay, so what?
he knew we would see these games. It's another message from 1991.
tournament game sheets.
each of his moves takes either two or four seconds-- Never more, never less.
in the three games, He made 50 moves, after which he resigned.
so this is a code of some kind.
wait. Is this... This is Morse Code.
2-second moves are dots.
4-second moves are dashes.
there are 50 moves, so 50 characters.
and this is just jumbles of letters here.
not letters.
numbers in Morse Code have five dots or dashes.
50 divided by 5 is 10-- 10 digits.
is it a phone number?
prepaid cell.
he really did know the future.
well done. Leave a message.
this is agent Benford.
it's your move.
now we're traveling.
in English, please.
I know you like halibut.
some just came in this morning.
no, thank you.
I ate... some cereal.
Oh, that's not enough. You need protein.
you are kind, but I can't.
it's... Too much money.
I want a... new beginning.
and new love.
some miso soup, a little rice?
okay. - Okay.
not today.
come here often?
I'm beginning to feel like a regular.
don't you have anything better to do than hang around a chemo ward?
Bryce, you're my friend.
you're crazy if you think I'm gonna let you go through this alone.
I appreciate what you're doing, but I don't want you to see me like this.
is this about your pride?
a little bit, yeah.
Hello, it's me.
you've glued pennies to the wall with my lunatic mother.
I think we've both seen behind the curtain.
besides, the chemo's gonna make you sick as a dog in 24 hours.
so tonight let's have some fun.
okay, let's do it.
but I'm buying dinner.
you call S.F.P.D.?
what do you think?
help you guys?
special agent Benford. Agent Noh.
detective John Smi.
Yes, that's my real name. What do you need?
what happened here?
eh, some guy from the chess club took two in the back of the head.
don't tell me--Ian Mckinnon?
Yeah, Ian Mckinnon.
person of interest?
not anymore.
Ian Mckinnon was unlucky enough to play a few games of chess back in the '80s,
and now he's dead.
he was our best lead on Frost, but our leak turned him into a homicide investigation.
San Francisco Bureau is handling the follow-up, but I'm not expecting much.
how long between when you first made contact and time of death?
eight hours tops.
there's only one conclusion.
the leak we've been tracking
that's compromised the security of the whole mosaic investigation-- is inside the bureau.
not just the bureau.
no.
inside our office.
I've been ordered to give full agency support, fresh pair of eyes, all the rest of that crap.
you got a play?
my dad knew a guy who used to go blast fishing.
he'd throw a stick of dynamite in the water and watch the fish float to the top.
it was ugly, but it worked.
game on.
just don't forget who your friends are.
what's unacceptable is that one of them is my enemy.
I need you to step away from your desk.
what the hell is going on here?
everyone's required to assemble in the conference room, sir.
on whose authorization?
sorry, assistant director Wedeck. Orders.
whose orders?
I'm not at liberty to say.
that's not part of the Task Force Agreement.
uh, no calls, and I'll need your cell phone, please.
don't touch me, all right?
sir, your phone.
what's going on?
someone lose their keys?
Simon Campos? - Yeah?
you're in there also, sir.
I'm not really an employee. I'm more of a visitor.
what is this? I've not even had my coffee yet.
what's this about?
judging from the way our offices are being torn apart,
I'd say an Interagency Task Force has been formed and is looking for a leak.
we can't just look for the leak on our own?
Yeah.
I think the point is, one of us is a mole.
and Mark?
apparently already vetted.
this office has been swept.
there's your leak.
get out.
it's voice-activated.
when your office is swept for bugs at 4: 00 a. m... The sweepers don't make any sound.
no sound, no transmission.
you've vetted the sweepers?
since the blackout, all techs have been agency-contracted-- Blind assignments.
that's how you do security.
they just don't know about the singing.
so who has access to your office, Mark?
everyone in that room.
time to light the fuse.
ladies and gentlemen, as you may have deduced,
we're closing in on a leak inside the FBI that is hampering the mosaic investigation.
now anyone want to confess?
no?
then it's the hard road.
you'll be first, agent Noh, as you were part of the failed attempt to contact Ian Mckinnon.
you got anything to say about this?
we have to do this.
Vogel, you're a son of a bitch. You know that?
true as that may be, I'm working with agent Benford today.
I was with you the whole time in San Francisco.
I don't think you're the mole.
who then? - Someone in that room.
if you don't think I'm the mole, what the hell am I doing in here?
I need the mole to think I suspect everyone, even you.
how long are we gonna be stuck in here?
good question.
they've got their whole procedure to go through
Re-vet contact histories, bureau records, computers.
that could take days. They're gonna want to vet all of our personal files.
not if they don't have passwords.
you didn't give up your passwords?
not to my personal files, no.
something on your computer you don't want people to see?
no, I mean, nothing that's... Sensitive.
you know, I'm--I'm clean.
it's porn.
agent Curdy, downloading naked cheerleaders on FBI time?
it--it's nothing like that.
It's--it's--it's, um... It's just... It's an R.P.G.
what?
it's--it's an R.P.G. It's a role-playing game.
I play "Warlocks of Avalon" online.
I'm a seventh level druid. My name is "argothic."
you have any special powers?
um, cape of invisibility, lightning hammer, elixir of life, healing.
that's impressive. - Yeah, it's cool.
you're next. Vreede.
can I borrow that cape?
there any reason we can't get back to work, do something useful?
Vogel found a microtransmitter... In that key.
you want to be useful?
tell me who put that in my office.
you think it was one of us?
that's the working theory.
"M..." For "Mark." Nice touch.
unless it was you, Marcie.
can you shut up for, like, five minutes?
want some sugar? - I don't use sugar.
mark? We're with you. You know that.
Thanks.
but we're close.
we'll get him.
good thing the fate of the planet doesn't rely on Mark benford finding the mole.
excuse me!
Koreatown's further west.
no. I'm not korean. I'm japanese.
either way, you gotta get on the bus.
you want this car to do that?
that's the idea.
I look?
you look?
you look like you don't belong here, and you definitely don't belong under the car.
hydraulics or nitrogen air bags?
hydraulics.
could be fracture in cylinder.
I can help.
maybe I surprise you, yes?
okay, ninja girl.
but if you break my axle, I'm coming after you.
thank you.
this is really screwing with my trust issues. You know that?
Yeah, you've been through a lot, Janis.
I took a bullet, Mk.
and I'm seriously a suspect?
you have to admit that getting shot and living Kes for a perfect cover.
screw you, Vogel.
I'm sure there's a reason for this, but you got a number of unaccounted personal breaks
in the weeks since the blackout--13 in all.
so?
in the three previous years at the bureau, You've taken precisely... Two.
mark, you know what I saw in my flash-forward.
I've been going to a fertility clinic.
Yeah. You only had eight visits. We checked.
so what?
so I went out to... Go buy some shoes.
come on, Mark. - Where were you?
what is it, Janis?
ever since the shooting, I've been looking at everyone differently... Suspicious.
just checking up.
and you found something?
does he have to be here for this?
Marcie has a brother.
we know about him. - There's another one...
a half brother. He's very sick.
he's dying in Missouri in a full care facility.
it's expensive.
Marcie didn't name him in any of her applications.
those absences--I went off is to look into some things.
you never mentioned this before.
I was waiting. - For what?
I was waiting to see if she did something.
and Marcie's paying for this care?
there was a deposit made to an account for $50, 000 three months ago-- Anonymous.
okay, Janis. Thanks.
mark, I don't know anything for sure.
I'm just trying to help. - You've done the right thing.
it doesn't feel like it.
you trust her?
you know what, Vogel?
being around you makes me not trust anyone anymore.
it's gonna rain.
Yep, but we're together.
we're having a girls' day.
I don't want to have a girls' day.
I want daddy to be here.
daddy wants to be here, too.
then why isn't he?
here's the thing, sweetie.
daddy and I love each other very much.
but most of all, we love you.
and we're always gonna be a family.
that's never gonna change. I promise.
come on. Let's go for a ride.
yeah? Let's do it. - Okay.
can I ride the ferris wheel?
you want to go on the ferris wheel?
so I went through Marcie's background.
she did declare her brother in her initial application.
but Janis said she didn't.
the original vetting records were at a regional field office.
when they were routed to D.C. An entirely separate file was created.
it was easy to miss, man.
you okay?
Yeah. No. No.
I moved out of the house.
Olivia and me--we're... I don't know.
I-I moved out.
sorry.
is this about what you saw in your flash-forward?
partly that, partly what she saw.
is there anything I can do?
no.
but Marcie's still a suspect, so keep digging.
all right.
tell your future.
step up and I...
in your future...
can we do that again? - No, my love. Let'go.
let's go. Okay, let's go.
can we go again? Can we go again?
no, sweetie.
why are you following us?
because it's my job.
I'm special agent Danforth Crowley.
your husband assigned me to be your security detail.
your safety is his number one priority.
you don't know much English, So I know you don't have a work visa.
I can try to get you paid off the books.
that's your first job.
client wants more horsepower, so we've been trying to remap the E.C.U.
my guys only work on carbureted engines, so for them it's like... Japanese.
German.
you said you were some big-time engineer back in Japan.
maybe you can figure this out.
Yes. It is no problem.
you didn't tell us you were hiring a masseuse.
en up. Cut the music. I got something to say.
this is Keiko.
she works here now.
that means she's part of the family.
treat her with respect, or we're gonna have a problem.
everyone get that?
I'll take that as a yes.
all right.
get to work.
Hey, it's me.
I just wanted to thank you for that security detail.
it scared the hell out of me, but I guess it helps.
Charlie misses you.
um, anyway, I'm at the hospital, so call me if you
Olivia? We need to talk.
I swear I wouldn't bother you if it wasn't absolutely necessary.
wow, you literally have the world's worst timing.
well, yeah. I've heard that before.
what do you want, Lloyd?
okay, I need to know exactly what you saw in your flash-forward.
I wrote a formula on your bedroom mirror,
and I think it relates somehow to the global blackout,but what I saw was incomplete.
did you see it?
Yes, I did... part of it.
I have to make a call.
after a while, I got up from the bed.
then I noticed something was written on the mirror.
it was written in lip stick.
most of it was indecipherable, but I did recognize this.
Halothane.
it's an anesthetic.
quantum physics and anesthetics...
that's what Mark and I were working on in our flash-forward.
I thought Q.E.D. meant quantum electrodynamics.
but we were... building a quantum entanglement device.
good. Well, that clears that up.
I have to be getting on with my rounds.
uh, yes, right. Of course. Listen, I-I don't want you to think I-I'm harassing you.
no, I know.
you're just trying to save the world.
good-bye.
so you come here every single night just in case this guy shows up?
and during the daytime.
I know. I know.
but it's the only way I can find him.
all right.
I respect that.
you saw your fate, and now you're doing your thing.
when I saw my future, it was the best day of my life.
it was the first day I let myself want what was in my heart.
so like you say, I am doing my thing.
can I ask, what did you see?
something different than you.
let's leave it at that.
you are kind to give me a job.
we're lucky to have you.
thank you, Emil.
you ever tried sea urchin?
no. Is it good?
it's like eating somebody's thyroid.
well, I'm sure Keiko loves it.
and if she's the woman you were in love with in your vision, You have to eat it with her.
wait. This-- this could be a problem.
what if sushi's her favorite food, and that's all she ever wants to eat?
okay. Suddenly she's a mogwai. You're being ridiculous.
a-a what?
never mind.
WA. What--what's a mogwai?
I'm not explaining it to you.
justify your metaphor, young lady.
God.
um, mogwai-- You know, gizmo-- the little furry creatures
that turn into gremlins if you don't feed 'em right.
they had dietary restrictions. It's--forget it.
I know. It's a very nerdy metaphor.
just shut up and read the menu.
okay.
I don't know.
I'm just not feeling sushi tonight.
well, I am.
okay.
I guess I can have teriyaki.
you're kind of a spoiled brat.
I never noticed that about you before.
how dare you?
I have cancer.
all right. What do you want to do?
I'm sorry.
um... I don't know why-- why I just did that.
I-I know why I did that, but...
It's--you're thinking about another woman.
you know, you can't just kiss me... In little tokyo, no less.
Yeah, I know.
I'm, um, sorry.
it's just... You're great.
honest mistake.
Hey, just buy me a burger, and we'll call it even.
deal.
good morning, Keiko.
morning.
too much sake?
next time we have Tequila.
how's it going?
this car will go very fast.
you know, we just need a little more horsepower.
we're not trying to launch it into space, you know?
Immigration!
L.C.E. Nobody move! Hands behind your heads!
just do what I do.
hands behind your head!
move it! Put your hands up now!
now! Do it now! Don't move!
you Emil Gutierrez?
you're under arrest for employment of undocumented workers.
what's your name?
do you have an I-9?
surprise, surprise.
all right. Load 'em into the van. Let's go.
Hey, it's me.
listen, I-I had a-a great time last night... Uh, and I'm--I'm sorry about kissing you.
um... You know, actually, I'm--I'm... I'm not.
I'm glad.
so... Okay, well, Anyway.
uh, bye.
they've been in there 36 hours.
got anything?
all of Marcie's background has been gone through by Vogel's people already
financials, phone records, background checks up the wazoo.
I'm doing surveillance tagging right now.
this surveillance tech isgood.
wait.
go back.
go back there.
how many times does she have coffee?
she has coffee most of the time. Why?
she doesn't use sugar.
okay.
give me time stamps for every time she put sugar in her coffee.
each of these time stamps corresponds to a day a key piece of information was leaked.
look at that.
no one knew about the pigeon, Utah, trip...
crap!
or the Somali intel that triggered the attack in Washington.
every time she put sugar in her coffee, she was signaling her handlers.
Marcie, what are you doing?
down! Everybody down!
down, down, down!
go!
cut her off at the stairs!
go, go, go!
down, down, down!
down! Down!
we believe that this man was somehow connected to the blackout.
he's highly efficient in advanced computing equipment.
he also seems to have a penchant for chess.
the man you call D. Gibbons-- his real name is Dyson Frost.
Hello, Demetri.
my name is Dyson Frost.
got your attention, didn't I?
in my flash-forward, I saw this symbol.
I remember the images, but I just can't put them together.
your have to find her, Bryce.
our entire investigation hinges on what's in your head.
I'm here to make sure you don't lose it before April 29th.
we went to Utah. - Officedown!
D. Gibbons know we're coming.
you unearthed the Solia photos.
five minutes later, we're getting shot at.
whoever we're investigating knows what we're doing before we do it.
we have them all.
you're forgetting there's another part to what we saw
the part where we're not together.
Hey, honey.
I want to go away with you and with Charlie.
I just want to get away from all of this.
yes or No?
Thanks.
Hey, I'm sorry. I was in surgery.
Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine.
Oh, god. What happened?
um, I ran into a bullet.
babe, I'm serious.
6 inches this way, this bullet's in your heart.
I know.
I'm not sure I can handle this anymore.
Livy, I was an FBI agent when you married me.
but it is different now. We have a daughter.
I mean, if something happens to you, I... I don't wanna...
look, I get that this is who you are.
but it--it's different.
I-I mean, I've got to know that our family comes first.
something's gotta change.
Wedeck offered me a position on the DHS Counterterrorism Task Force.
it's an improvement?
uh... It's surveillance. Two guys in a car eating burritos,
listening to phone calls in Farsi.
I'll be out of the line of fire.
my biggest concerns will be boredom and cholesterol.
you're gonna hate that.
mm, but I can take it.
what I can't take is losing you and Charlie.
our family will always come first. I promise.
so, um, if you need anything, I'll be staying at the Wedecks'.
I'm sorry. I have no idea how to do this.
neither do I.
she's been in there 20 minutes.
I'll call you tonight.
are you my new partner?
if you are, I insist you change your clothes.
can't catch bad guys in pajamas.
where are you going?
I'm just going to the Wedecks' for a little while.
how long is a little while?
well, I... hope it's not very long at all.
what's this?
you lost your bracelet.
it'll keep you safe from the bad guys until you come back home.
let me put it back on.
come here.
I love you so much, Charlie-bear.
if you're watching this message in 2010, that means the global blackout was successful.
that also means we've had a near miss in pigeon, Utah.
how do I know all this?
because I myself have had hundreds of flash-forwards.
in nearly all of my futures, I end up dying on March 15th-- Like you, Demetri.
so if you managed to find this tape in Somalia,
it would seem our fates are on a collision course,

there's gonna be another blackout.
what?
how? When?
we have to assume that's agent Benford's next move-- To find out and to prevent it.
so let's make it a good one.
find Dyson Frost... Yesterday.
this is magnificent work.
master circuits built from basic sketches I designed when I was 13.
well, when you finish patting yourself on the back, can we get to work?
I had to go to a lot of trouble to get all this,

go see your girl friend.
ticktock.
nothing. I ran face recognition software on every available database.
since Frost faked his death in 1990, There is not one record--not one sighting of this guy.
nothing. - He's a thorough guy...
likes complex things like chess.
he's also got an arrogant streak-- Likes people to know when he's winning.
I've been looking through membership lists of chess clubs pre -'90.
frost placed third in an amateur league in '87.
and the guy he beat lives in san Francisco.
his name is Ian Mckinnon.
mckinnon was the reigning champion until Frost beat him in an upset.
so I traced him and then I gave him a call.
but when I mentioned Frost, he hung up.
well, let's travel.
we need to get to San Francisco and talk to him, right?
Yeah. But first, there's something else.
this is Frost's final tournament against Mckinnon.
he uses a very risky play called the Queen Sacrifice.
looks like a total Hail Mary, But it's one of the most effective plays in the game.
okay, so what?
he knew we would see these games. It's another message from 1991.
tournament game sheets.
each of his moves takes either two or four seconds-- Never more, never less.
in the three games, He made 50 moves, after which he resigned.
so this is a code of some kind.
wait. Is this... This is Morse Code.
2-second moves are dots.
4-second moves are dashes.
there are 50 moves, so 50 characters.
and this is just jumbles of letters here.
not letters.
numbers in Morse Code have five dots or dashes.
50 divided by 5 is 10-- 10 digits.
is it a phone number?
prepaid cell.
he really did know the future.
well done. Leave a message.
this is agent Benford.
it's your move.
now we're traveling.
in English, please.
I know you like halibut.
some just came in this morning.
no, thank you.
I ate... some cereal.
Oh, that's not enough. You need protein.
you are kind, but I can't.
it's... Too much money.
I want a... new beginning.
and new love.
some miso soup, a little rice?
okay. - Okay.
not today.
come here often?
I'm beginning to feel like a regular.
don't you have anything better to do than hang around a chemo ward?
Bryce, you're my friend.
you're crazy if you think I'm gonna let you go through this alone.
I appreciate what you're doing, but I don't want you to see me like this.
is this about your pride?
a little bit, yeah.
Hello, it's me.
you've glued pennies to the wall with my lunatic mother.
I think we've both seen behind the curtain.
besides, the chemo's gonna make you sick as a dog in 24 hours.
so tonight let's have some fun.
okay, let's do it.
but I'm buying dinner.
you call S.F.P.D.?
what do you think?
help you guys?
special agent Benford. Agent Noh.
detective John Smi.
Yes, that's my real name. What do you need?
what happened here?
eh, some guy from the chess club took two in the back of the head.
don't tell me--Ian Mckinnon?
Yeah, Ian Mckinnon.
person of interest?
not anymore.
Ian Mckinnon was unlucky enough to play a few games of chess back in the '80s,
and now he's dead.
he was our best lead on Frost, but our leak turned him into a homicide investigation.
San Francisco Bureau is handling the follow-up, but I'm not expecting much.
how long between when you first made contact and time of death?
eight hours tops.
there's only one conclusion.
the leak we've been tracking
that's compromised the security of the whole mosaic investigation-- is inside the bureau.
not just the bureau.
no.
inside our office.
I've been ordered to give full agency support, fresh pair of eyes, all the rest of that crap.
you got a play?
my dad knew a guy who used to go blast fishing.
he'd throw a stick of dynamite in the water and watch the fish float to the top.
it was ugly, but it worked.
game on.
just don't forget who your friends are.
what's unacceptable is that one of them is my enemy.
I need you to step away from your desk.
what the hell is going on here?
everyone's required to assemble in the conference room, sir.
on whose authorization?
sorry, assistant director Wedeck. Orders.
whose orders?
I'm not at liberty to say.
that's not part of the Task Force Agreement.
uh, no calls, and I'll need your cell phone, please.
don't touch me, all right?
sir, your phone.
what's going on?
someone lose their keys?
Simon Campos? - Yeah?
you're in there also, sir.
I'm not really an employee. I'm more of a visitor.
what is this? I've not even had my coffee yet.
what's this about?
judging from the way our offices are being torn apart,
I'd say an Interagency Task Force has been formed and is looking for a leak.
we can't just look for the leak on our own?
Yeah.
I think the point is, one of us is a mole.
and Mark?
apparently already vetted.
this office has been swept.
there's your leak.
get out.
it's voice-activated.
when your office is swept for bugs at 4: 00 a. m... The sweepers don't make any sound.
no sound, no transmission.
you've vetted the sweepers?
since the blackout, all techs have been agency-contracted-- Blind assignments.
that's how you do security.
they just don't know about the singing.
so who has access to your office, Mark?
everyone in that room.
time to light the fuse.
ladies and gentlemen, as you may have deduced,
we're closing in on a leak inside the FBI that is hampering the mosaic investigation.
now anyone want to confess?
no?
then it's the hard road.
you'll be first, agent Noh, as you were part of the failed attempt to contact Ian Mckinnon.
you got anything to say about this?
we have to do this.
Vogel, you're a son of a bitch. You know that?
true as that may be, I'm working with agent Benford today.
I was with you the whole time in San Francisco.
I don't think you're the mole.
who then? - Someone in that room.
if you don't think I'm the mole, what the hell am I doing in here?
I need the mole to think I suspect everyone, even you.
how long are we gonna be stuck in here?
good question.
they've got their whole procedure to go through
Re-vet contact histories, bureau records, computers.
that could take days. They're gonna want to vet all of our personal files.
not if they don't have passwords.
you didn't give up your passwords?
not to my personal files, no.
something on your computer you don't want people to see?
no, I mean, nothing that's... Sensitive.
you know, I'm--I'm clean.
it's porn.
agent Curdy, downloading naked cheerleaders on FBI time?
it--it's nothing like that.
It's--it's--it's, um... It's just... It's an R.P.G.
what?
it's--it's an R.P.G. It's a role-playing game.
I play "Warlocks of Avalon" online.
I'm a seventh level druid. My name is "argothic."
you have any special powers?
um, cape of invisibility, lightning hammer, elixir of life, healing.
that's impressive. - Yeah, it's cool.
you're next. Vreede.
can I borrow that cape?
there any reason we can't get back to work, do something useful?
Vogel found a microtransmitter... In that key.
you want to be useful?
tell me who put that in my office.
you think it was one of us?
that's the working theory.
"M..." For "Mark." Nice touch.
unless it was you, Marcie.
can you shut up for, like, five minutes?
want some sugar? - I don't use sugar.
mark? We're with you. You know that.
Thanks.
but we're close.
we'll get him.
good thing the fate of the planet doesn't rely on Mark benford finding the mole.
excuse me!
Koreatown's further west.
no. I'm not korean. I'm japanese.
either way, you gotta get on the bus.
you want this car to do that?
that's the idea.
I look?
you look?
you look like you don't belong here, and you definitely don't belong under the car.
hydraulics or nitrogen air bags?
hydraulics.
could be fracture in cylinder.
I can help.
maybe I surprise you, yes?
okay, ninja girl.
but if you break my axle, I'm coming after you.
thank you.
this is really screwing with my trust issues. You know that?
Yeah, you've been through a lot, Janis.
I took a bullet, Mk.
and I'm seriously a suspect?
you have to admit that getting shot and living Kes for a perfect cover.
screw you, Vogel.
I'm sure there's a reason for this, but you got a number of unaccounted personal breaks
in the weeks since the blackout--13 in all.
so?
in the three previous years at the bureau, You've taken precisely... Two.
mark, you know what I saw in my flash-forward.
I've been going to a fertility clinic.
Yeah. You only had eight visits. We checked.
so what?
so I went out to... Go buy some shoes.
come on, Mark. - Where were you?
what is it, Janis?
ever since the shooting, I've been looking at everyone differently... Suspicious.
just checking up.
and you found something?
does he have to be here for this?
Marcie has a brother.
we know about him. - There's another one...
a half brother. He's very sick.
he's dying in Missouri in a full care facility.
it's expensive.
Marcie didn't name him in any of her applications.
those absences--I went off is to look into some things.
you never mentioned this before.
I was waiting. - For what?
I was waiting to see if she did something.
and Marcie's paying for this care?
there was a deposit made to an account for $50, 000 three months ago-- Anonymous.
okay, Janis. Thanks.
mark, I don't know anything for sure.
I'm just trying to help. - You've done the right thing.
it doesn't feel like it.
you trust her?
you know what, Vogel?
being around you makes me not trust anyone anymore.
it's gonna rain.
Yep, but we're together.
we're having a girls' day.
I don't want to have a girls' day.
I want daddy to be here.
daddy wants to be here, too.
then why isn't he?
here's the thing, sweetie.
daddy and I love each other very much.
but most of all, we love you.
and we're always gonna be a family.
that's never gonna change. I promise.
come on. Let's go for a ride.
yeah? Let's do it. - Okay.
can I ride the ferris wheel?
you want to go on the ferris wheel?
so I went through Marcie's background.
she did declare her brother in her initial application.
but Janis said she didn't.
the original vetting records were at a regional field office.
when they were routed to D.C. An entirely separate file was created.
it was easy to miss, man.
you okay?
Yeah. No. No.
I moved out of the house.
Olivia and me--we're... I don't know.
I-I moved out.
sorry.
is this about what you saw in your flash-forward?
partly that, partly what she saw.
is there anything I can do?
no.
but Marcie's still a suspect, so keep digging.
all right.
tell your future.
step up and I...
in your future...
can we do that again? - No, my love. Let'go.
let's go. Okay, let's go.
can we go again? Can we go again?
no, sweetie.
why are you following us?
because it's my job.
I'm special agent Danforth Crowley.
your husband assigned me to be your security detail.
your safety is his number one priority.
you don't know much English, So I know you don't have a work visa.
I can try to get you paid off the books.
that's your first job.
client wants more horsepower, so we've been trying to remap the E.C.U.
my guys only work on carbureted engines, so for them it's like... Japanese.
German.
you said you were some big-time engineer back in Japan.
maybe you can figure this out.
Yes. It is no problem.
you didn't tell us you were hiring a masseuse.
en up. Cut the music. I got something to say.
this is Keiko.
she works here now.
that means she's part of the family.
treat her with respect, or we're gonna have a problem.
everyone get that?
I'll take that as a yes.
all right.
get to work.
Hey, it's me.
I just wanted to thank you for that security detail.
it scared the hell out of me, but I guess it helps.
Charlie misses you.
um, anyway, I'm at the hospital, so call me if you
Olivia? We need to talk.
I swear I wouldn't bother you if it wasn't absolutely necessary.
wow, you literally have the world's worst timing.
well, yeah. I've heard that before.
what do you want, Lloyd?
okay, I need to know exactly what you saw in your flash-forward.
I wrote a formula on your bedroom mirror,
and I think it relates somehow to the global blackout,but what I saw was incomplete.
did you see it?
Yes, I did... part of it.
I have to make a call.
after a while, I got up from the bed.
then I noticed something was written on the mirror.
it was written in lip stick.
most of it was indecipherable, but I did recognize this.
Halothane.
it's an anesthetic.
quantum physics and anesthetics...
that's what Mark and I were working on in our flash-forward.
I thought Q.E.D. meant quantum electrodynamics.
but we were... building a quantum entanglement device.
good. Well, that clears that up.
I have to be getting on with my rounds.
uh, yes, right. Of course. Listen, I-I don't want you to think I-I'm harassing you.
no, I know.
you're just trying to save the world.
good-bye.
so you come here every single night just in case this guy shows up?
and during the daytime.
I know. I know.
but it's the only way I can find him.
all right.
I respect that.
you saw your fate, and now you're doing your thing.
when I saw my future, it was the best day of my life.
it was the first day I let myself want what was in my heart.
so like you say, I am doing my thing.
can I ask, what did you see?
something different than you.
let's leave it at that.
you are kind to give me a job.
we're lucky to have you.
thank you, Emil.
you ever tried sea urchin?
no. Is it good?
it's like eating somebody's thyroid.
well, I'm sure Keiko loves it.
and if she's the woman you were in love with in your vision, You have to eat it with her.
wait. This-- this could be a problem.
what if sushi's her favorite food, and that's all she ever wants to eat?
okay. Suddenly she's a mogwai. You're being ridiculous.
a-a what?
never mind.
WA. What--what's a mogwai?
I'm not explaining it to you.
justify your metaphor, young lady.
God.
um, mogwai-- You know, gizmo-- the little furry creatures
that turn into gremlins if you don't feed 'em right.
they had dietary restrictions. It's--forget it.
I know. It's a very nerdy metaphor.
just shut up and read the menu.
okay.
I don't know.
I'm just not feeling sushi tonight.
well, I am.
okay.
I guess I can have teriyaki.
you're kind of a spoiled brat.
I never noticed that about you before.
how dare you?
I have cancer.
all right. What do you want to do?
I'm sorry.
um... I don't know why-- why I just did that.
I-I know why I did that, but...
It's--you're thinking about another woman.
you know, you can't just kiss me... In little tokyo, no less.
Yeah, I know.
I'm, um, sorry.
it's just... You're great.
honest mistake.
Hey, just buy me a burger, and we'll call it even.
deal.
good morning, Keiko.
morning.
too much sake?
next time we have Tequila.
how's it going?
this car will go very fast.
you know, we just need a little more horsepower.
we're not trying to launch it into space, you know?
Immigration!
L.C.E. Nobody move! Hands behind your heads!
just do what I do.
hands behind your head!
move it! Put your hands up now!
now! Do it now! Don't move!
you Emil Gutierrez?
you're under arrest for employment of undocumented workers.
what's your name?
do you have an I-9?
surprise, surprise.
all right. Load 'em into the van. Let's go.
Hey, it's me.
listen, I-I had a-a great time last night... Uh, and I'm--I'm sorry about kissing you.
um... You know, actually, I'm--I'm... I'm not.
I'm glad.
so... Okay, well, Anyway.
uh, bye.
they've been in there 36 hours.
got anything?
all of Marcie's background has been gone through by Vogel's people already
financials, phone records, background checks up the wazoo.
I'm doing surveillance tagging right now.
this surveillance tech isgood.
wait.
go back.
go back there.
how many times does she have coffee?
she has coffee most of the time. Why?
she doesn't use sugar.
okay.
give me time stamps for every time she put sugar in her coffee.
each of these time stamps corresponds to a day a key piece of information was leaked.
look at that.
no one knew about the pigeon, Utah, trip...
crap!
or the Somali intel that triggered the attack in Washington.
every time she put sugar in her coffee, she was signaling her handlers.
Marcie, what are you doing?
down! Everybody down!
down, down, down!
go!
cut her off at the stairs!
go, go, go!
down, down, down!
down! Down!
on october 6, the planet blacked out for two minutes and seventeen seconds
the whole world saw the future
it would seem our fates are on a collision course.
find Dyson Frost yesterday.
the next move is Marck Benford's.
Dyson Frost? It's your move.
I took this picture.
she saw something she shouldn't have
and got in trouble with Jericho.
the second that Jericho knows that I'm still alive...
they'll find me, and they'll kill me. - Tracy Stark...
I know you took her. Now you're gonna give her back.
I can't give you your daughter back. - Then we go to war.
you will be shot 3 times on March 15th.
it will be your gun, Agent Benford. - Demetri?
yeah? - The box is here, but the gun is gone.
my first term was a bitch. I could have used you, Stan.
I'm sorry I couldn't bring you in.
I don't want you to think I-I'm harassing you.
I know. You're just trying to save the world. Good-bye.
she was signaling her handlers.
I should have known... two moles,
in case one is caught... and not one person in the office
would suspect it's you.
today is more than just the beginning of your career.
today, along with a badge and a gun,
you're gonna get a story about your first day on the job.
every special Agent has one.
some are funny. Some are tragic.
some are boring.
but today won't be the most important day
in your career as an FBI Agent.
that day is somewhere down the line.
you won't see it coming. It sneaks up on you.
it'll most likely be an anonymous moment...
a crossroads where you're asked to do something,
make some kind of personal sacrifice
for the good of someone else, and that person may never know
your name or see your face or even understand what you did.
but you'll know.
and isn't that why you're here, after all?
because you can be counted on to do the right thing
at the right time, every time.
welcome to the FBI.
well done. Nicely done.
all right, ladies and gentlemen.
see me for your partner assignments. Congratulations.
nicely done. - special Agent Vreede...
is it "vreed-y" or "Vreede" as in "freed"?
I don't know. I got Benford.
no. Switch with me.
Why? - He's a legend. He's done it all...
surveillance, counterterrorism, trafficking. Come on.
do it. - Whatever, but you gotta take it up with Wedeck and get it approved.
done. Thank you.
of course. - Yes!
Janis, who'd you get? - No partner. Headed to analysis. Boring.
you know, I got it worse. I report to you.
I mean, how could that be? I scored higher.
Yeah, in, like, one category.
come on, Marcie. We'll have fun. - Yeah, we've been a team since quantico...
booze and bullets. - Yeah, well, what am I, the mascot?
no, you're like our Captain.
Yeah, you'll probably outpace all of us. I'm sure of it.
Yeah, we're... we're sure.
interview of Marcie Turoff,
agents Benford and Noh questioning.
march 12, 2010.
first thing we'd like to know is...
who came after us in that parking garage in D. C?
I don't know.
who came after us in the parking garage in D. C?
I don't know.
on to the next. Are they still after us?
I don't know. - Demetri.
who killed Ian McKinnon? - Come on. Let's go.
is that who's coming after me? - Let's go.
we need those answers.
Yeah, but there are a whole lot of other ones we need to get to first.
listen, Dem.
you think I don't have March 15th circled in my calendar, too?
we both know there's a chance you'll die in three days.
look, you keep chasing down leads.
I'll let you know when we're ready for your questions, alright?
Hey, Janis, I need your help in here with Marcie.
me?
what, you got something more important than grilling our mole?
no. Of course not.
what were your duties?
every week, I'd take whatever information there was
in the mosaic investigation and leave it at a dead drop.
who recruited you?
I was approached by a man three months before the blackout hit.
what was his name?
all in due time.
he asked if I wanted to be a part of something big.
and you said yes.
you think I sold out my friends and my country, but...
you don't know me.
why don't you enlighten us?
come on. Don't you remember my flash-forward?
no, you don't, 'cause neither of you ever bothered to ask me what I saw.
I was incarcerated.
that didn't cross your mind
when you shot six of your fellow agents?
it did.
but even though I was in jail,
I was happier than I've been in years.
I thought we'd have to beg for life without parole.
I told you they'd come around. Until I tell them who recruited me,
I'm indispensable. For the first time since I got here,
I actually felt like I was important.
I need you, Mark.
these are our guests from Washington.
and while they're grateful for all our efforts - In apprehending Agent Turoff... - Oh, no. You gotta be kidding.
director Middleton feels more comfortable
having such a highly valued target where he can keep an eye on her.
and where he can give the press conferences himself.
hear me out. We know her. We can read her. Just give us one more day.
I know it's frustrating,
but let's try to get something positive done today...
like maybe get back to what caused the blackout.
now I'll be out of the office for a couple of hours,
so give me an update. Dyson Frost...
he's our best lead so far. Where are we?
I've left four messages. Haven't heard back.
I'm afraid he's just toying with us.
the guy's been wanting to talk to you for 19 years,
and now he's playing hard to get?
shel, see what you can get by tracing Frost's phone.
Yes, sir.
Hey, I just got a call from l. A.P. D.
they've got a ballistics report saying that Mark's gun,
the one that's supposed to kill me in three days,
was used in a murder last night.
so what do we know from the eyewitness reports?
55-year-old, in his cot,
presumably asleep.
at 3: 33 A. M. the shooter walked up to him,
and a couple of insomniacs heard the victim say...
I knew it would be you. I just didn't want to believe.
the shooter must have had a silencer on your gun.
he plugged him three times in the chest at close range.
uh, do you want to put that thing away?
sorry. - Thanks.
physical description ranging from...
5'5" white guy to a 6' Indian.
another dead end.
wasn't there something about a car?
somebody said they saw a 1970s blue sedan drive away... Foreign make.
that's a start.
l. A.P. D.'s gonna forward the victim's effects to us.
can't wait to sift through that.
forget about the shooter.
who's the one other person we know who handled that gun?
there were 40 agents in that evidence room.
they were all cleared months ago.
one of those agents Marcie?
stop! Stop! - You guys never give up.
I need to talk to her. - She's in our custody now.
you can't take her. She's part of our investigation.
I'm just doing my job, same as you doing yours.
who'd you give my gun to, Marcie? - I don't know.
come on. Who has it? - I don't know.
come on. Don't do this. We were friends.
look, I'm sorry. Really, I am.
all I heard is that you're supposed to die in L. A.
what? Give me more specifics.
who does it? When? - It was a voice on the phone
when I called to report the gun in lockup.
who'd you call?
a number. It was different every time.
look, that's all I know. There isn't any more.
look, you're gonna die in three days,
and there's nothing you can do to stop it.
I'm sorry.
come on. - Marcie, come on.
come on, come on!
sweetie, what is the hurry? We're here.
I told him we'd be here by 2: 00. We're late.
who? - Dylan!
Hey, Dylan.
nuts to you, squirrlio! Toot! Toot!
come on, Dylan! - Okay, I'm coming.
did you know about this?
absolutely not.
Charlie, who arranged this?
I did! I got Dylan's phone number from him
when he was in the hospital.
he was very insistent about this specific park,
and now I know why. Do you normally come here?
well, the house is just around the corner.
right.
this is fun. - Come on. You go first.
look, I can sit on a bench or something. - It's fine.
doesn't have to be that way.
Dylan, what happened? - Let me see, sweetie.
we bonked heads. - Did he hit your teeth?
let me see, baby. Okay, Charlie, let's see. Open up.
I'm bleeding. - Okay. Let me see.
she okay? - Open your mouth.
here we go, Charlie. I want you to do something now.
just grab my hand, and when it hurts,
I want you to squeeze as hard as possible, okay?
is that all you got? Come on. You try a little bit harder than that.
that's good.
does this mean I can't go to the carnival, mommy?
no, I think you're gonna be just fine for the carnival.
I think you're gonna be okay.
Yeah, that's good. I'm starting to feel that a bit now.
listen, I'm just gonna go back to the car and get a bottle of water and a towel.
you'll be okay. - Okay.
Yeah. I see carnivals in your future. Come here.
I wanna go.
I know. Come here. It's okay, sweetie.
assistant director Wedeck?
that's me.
come this way.
she's ready for you. - Thank you.
Madame vice president.
good to see you, Stan.
it's been quite a while.
please sit. - Thank you.
thanks for coming on such short notice, Stan.
how is everything?
you want to tell me why the hell you dragged me out here?
it's nice to know my new position
hasn't changed your attitude towards me.
does the name Jericho ring a bell?
they're a private contractor operating over in Afghanistan.
I've heard of them.
agent Benford look into them a while back.
yes?
well, in my security briefing this morning,
I learned that Jericho's C. E. O. just tripled the security
around his malibu compound. I think you should take a look.
wrong department. NSA is who you want to call.
I don't want them to know.
I need this done off the books.
the vice president doesn't fly across the country 'cause some guy hired an extra night watchman.
in my vision, it was clear that Jericho had done some things
that threatened our national security.
the same vision where you saw yourself as president?
as a matter of fact, yes. And I was there because Jericho
did something that triggered a political crisis.
I can't find out anything about what they're doing.
but if it's bad enough to bring down president segovia,
it must be significant.
I've been keeping a close eye on every move they make,
and something is happening right now.
are you sure you don't know what it is?
and even if I did, Dave and I go back 25 years.
listen, these flash-forwards are coming true.
segovia is going down.
do you want to be out with the old or in with the new?
well now we know your gun's here in L. A.
Yeah, too bad Marcie couldn't tell us who's using it.
so I'll run this car info,
see if anything pings on a 1970s blue sedan.
we're gonna get this guy. - Yeah.
got a sec, Mark?
Jericho...
you used our database to look into them a few months ago.
is that a problem? No, no.
just curious why you did.
it was a favor for a friend...
wanted as much information as I could give him, which wasn't a lot.
a friend? Do all your friends ask you
to research third world military contractors?
he had questions about his daughter's death.
she was serving in Afghanistan.
he thinks Jericho is involved?
the things he told me...
they were in confidence.
I can respect that.
Thanks.
do you mind if I talk with him?
maybe ask him a few questions?
what's his name?
good luck finding him.
he's off the grid. I don't even know where he is - Or how to track him down. - Thank you, Mark.
sure.
Hey. Just heard on the scanner...
l. A.P. D.'s in the middle of a high-speed Chase.
driver... Ross Webber... has been spotted with a gun.
car they're following... '71 blue sedan.
the shooter from the homeless shelter?
how many criminals are driving the same disco era sedans, right?
any idea where they're headed?
there's your blue sedan.
where is he?
right inside. A bunch of people ran out. He's got hostages.
where in the building is he? - Second floor.
who's talking to him? - No one yet.
you think he's just gonna come out on his own?
captain doesn't want us to do anything till he gets here.
shots fired! Get down! Stay down!
you hang back.
I talk to him, try to make sure he releases the hostage.
once he does, you take your shot. - Sounds good,
except for the part about me staying on the sidelines.
no way you're going down there.
listen, I'm not gonna let that gun kill one more person.
march 15th... I know that's the day you're supposed to die.
who says you didn't get shot three days earlier?
who the hell is that?!
I'm right here!
try not to shoot me.
stop.
I told them the only person I want to talk to is Randy Savage!
macho man?
Yeah, I dig that. Uh, that's not me.
my name's Demetri. Oh, God!
you don't turn around in four seconds, I will kill her, Demetri.
doesn't matter to me. She's just a saleswoman.
that's what she gets for causing the blackout.
I said stop! - Okay.
Ross, you still have that gun, right?
I'm gonna take the clip off now.
here we go.
gone, buddy.
and, uh...
on my ankle, I got a gun, man.
I'm gonna take that off, too, okay?
we're not worrying about that anymore.
Hey, what were you saying, though, about...
about how salespeople caused the blackout? That's...
that's a fascinating theory.
I'd like to hear more about it.
they made us buy cell phones.
see, before everybody had a cell phone,
nobody ever blacked out. None of this ever... stop moving!
okay. You think I won't kill you?
you're about just plain incorrect.
I'm not afraid.
it's okay.
everybody's scared of dying, man.
she is.
look at her...
I'm scared of dying...
all three of us.
it's what makes us human, don't you think?
you're scared.
that's fine.
see, when people get scared, judgment gets clouded.
I'll be honest, man.
you have made some really bad decisions today.
but you can make a really good one, right now...
if you just give me the gun.
come on.
let me save your life.
E. M.T. says he's stable. We can question him in the hospital.
it's not your gun.
serial number is totally different.
your gun's still out there.
so you almost got yourself killed for nothing?
Yeah, I guess so.
all right.
you took him down,
saved an innocent woman.
that's fantastic work.
what I can't understand is,
if you thought that gun was gonna kill you, I mean...
cops had the place surrounded.
he was never gonna make it out ofere anyway.
that's why I needed to get to him, man...
so I could ask him why.
do you remember...
that speech you gave my first day on the job?
it was all about being the kind of...
person... Who could be counted on
to do the right thing at the right time.
and, man, since October 6th, when I didn't see anything,
I have had a lot of trouble being that person.
and I need your help.
Why?
I mean, look at me.
if you think I've been making good choices lately,
you're crazier than I thought.
I'll do anything to help you, Demetri, so...
I'm gonna tell you something, and...
I really want you to listen.
get out of here.
you and Zoey just get out of here.
I'm not running away.
that's right. You're not.
you're being smart.
just promise me you'll go somewhere safe.
Yes. It's a copy of my notes
taken while witnessing the transaction.
and those handwritten notes are your only record of the events?
well, it was a very simple money-for-stolen-goods exchange.
that is very good.
agent Noh, who taught you to draw?
I guess I'm just naturally artistic.
lucky guy, right?
now your description here
of the alleged buyer... oh, here, further down in your notes...
can you read that for the court, please?
Caucasian male, average height/weight,
dark jacket, baseball cap.
when my client was booked,
he was photographed wearing a red jacket, not a dark one, wasn't he?
Yes.
and he clearly has a goatee, does he not, Agent Noh?
Yes. - So which individual...
bought the stolen computer disk, Agent Noh...
the one with the goatee...
or the one in your artistic notes?
because they're obviously not the same person.
objection... argumentative. - Sustained.
do I get to answer that? - Not really. No further questions.
I'm done with this witness.
Oh, you can go now.
come on. There's no need to take it personally.
that was a win that you just turned into a loss.
it was never really a win, because you were wrong.
you know what?
I'm gonna go ahead and take the stairs.
you know what? Look, I'm... I'm sorry.
I will turn the defense attorney off.
okay, that would be an instant improvement.
why don't you let me make it up to you?
can I... Take you to dinner?
you gotta be kidding me.
what?
there's not a chance in hell I would ever go out with you.
Hey. - Hey.
how are you?
good.
sit down. I want to talk to you.
it's okay.
you're beautiful.
shut up.
what is wrong with you?
nothing. It's good.
you know, I wasn't supposed to be there that day.
what day?
al Gough was supposed to be Mark's partner.
I switched with him, and because I was Mark's partner, I was covering the bust that led me to you.
all these tiny little decisions we make, you know,
without thinking, they... they all...
they all line up to lead us somewhere...
somewhere good. - Yeah.
so I want to ask you if you will...
marry me.
baby, we covered this. I-I said yeah.
no, I want to get married right now. - Okay.
I want to get married tomorrow.
then we get on a plane and we go to Hawaii.
we stay there through the 15th, maybe through April 29th.
listen, maybe we don't ever come home.
want to do it? - Are you serious?
I'm serious. - Hell, yes!
yes?
of course! Oh, I love you.
Hey.
Hi.
I... sorry. I just wanted to come by and say thanks for...
what you did with Charlie today in the park.
okay, um...
no problem.
well, thank you.
can I... can I get you to come in?
I just left the water running, but please, please come in.
sure.
I'm sorry. The dishes were getting kind of out of control.
can I get you something to drink?
I could offer you a carton of milk that expired yesterday,
some juice boxes or a bottle of gin.
no.
no, I think I... I think I should be going.
Really? - Yeah.
thank you for today.
Yeah, I do have a telephone.
you could've called to say thank you.
why are you here?
I don't know. I've just made such a mess of things.
I wish I could blame it all on Mark, but I really can't.
I made a ton of mistakes.
I know that feeling.
I tried my best with Linda after Dylan was born, but...
to be honest, I-I used his autism
as an excuse to get away from her.
even the thought of that makes me ashamed now.
I thought I was doing the right thing at the time.
you're damned if you do,
and then you're damned if you don't.
Yeah, maybe we just...
choose to live in the moment, you know, just grab the...
good things in our life when we recognize them.
I have to go. - Look. Wait.
I'm not trying to argue against Mark.
he's a brave man doing something extraordinary.
Yeah, he is.
this does kind of put me in a...
Lancelot-trying-to-persuade-Guinevere position.
Oh, you did not just compare yourself to Lancelot.
Yeah, well, the only other metaphor I had
involved protons and neutrons, and believe me,
under the circumstances, I went with the stronger choice.
I know that we're feeling the same thing right now.
how do you know what I'm feeling?
because I'm in that room on April the 29th.
that wasn't an accident.
this scares me.
it should.
who the hell are you?
it's okay, Aaron.
I work with Mark.
I'm a friend.
you mind telling me how you found me?
there was a computer in Echo Park doing Web searches
for a "jericho parwan Afghanistan,
Jericho central base
and "Jericho murder U. S. Soldiers.
that library's 2 miles from here.
and this is the 14th cash-only hotel I've hit.
well, here I am. Now what?
mark didn't want to tell me why you were so interested in Jericho.
but some very powerful people would love to take them down.
all they need is proof.
they got my daughter.
they kill her? - They tried. She's still alive.
but in your file it... - Tracy's alive.
she was here, but Jericho found her and took her back to Afghanistan.
I gotta believe I've only got so much time left to find her.
wait. You're... you're... you're going to Afghanistan?
sure am.
I know you were in the service and everything,
but how are you planning on getting there?
fly into Uzbekistan, cross the border at Termez.
and you're doing this with a U. S. Passport?
Yeah. - You'll be dead before you leave Hairaton.
I don't have a choice.
do you know why Jericho tried to kill your daughter two years ago?
she saw Jericho wipe out an entire village.
if I could help you get to Tracy...
do you think she would tell us the whole story?
Really? You can do that legally?
Hey, Demetri. Come here. - What?
come here.
I'm getting married. - Come here.
I'm getting married.
so would you be okay with Vreede officiating at your wedding?
define "okay.
no charge.
consider it my wedding gift.
you're gonna marry him?
Vreede's an Internet minister.
have I ever told you how awesome you are, Shelly Vreede?
you make me feel loved.
Janis, you're awesome, too. - Oh, thank you.
Janis is awesome.
that's very sweet. Thank you.
all right. - Mark is awesome.
time to take the groom home. - Yeah. Let's find a cab.
here we go, buddy. - All right.
okay, I'm sleepy.
Yeah. - Good night.
you got military clearance.
your cover is you're in Afghanistan to help install their power grid.
satellite phone.
video capability.
as soon as you can document what Tracy knows, I want it uploaded.
if you see any Jericho activity, I want it uploaded...
pictures, video, audio, anything you can get me.
no problem.
get yourself to Bagram as soon as you're clear.
military transports leave every two days.
I'll arrange a flight home. - Excellent.
I'm guessing...
you don't need me to tell you what to do with these.
I got a couple ideas.
all this gear is clean.
none of it can be traced back to this agency.
if they find you...
you're on your own.
is that it?
I guess it is.
thank you, Stan.
this isn't something I think I need to tell you, but...
there's a very good chance you're never coming back.
I saw myself with my daughter.
we were together in Afghanistan,
and she was alive.
God help anyone who stands in my way.
do you think I'm chicken for running away?
sometimes the best offense is a good defense.
no, Janis, I'm just scared.
you played this out as best as you could.
everybody needs a successful exit strategy.
this is yours.
Hey, um...
I want you to know, um...
Oh, Demetri, don't. - No, I want to. I-I have to...
stop.
just stop. - No, uh...
this may be my last chance, all right?
I'm pregnant.
what?
Oh, my gosh. This is perfect.
my mom is gonna be so excited.
well, I'm happy to let you use the space,
but since you aren't members here,
and, uh, since we didn't do any premarital counseling...
Oh, we don't need any premarital counseling.
we've been living together for a year. - I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.
listen, you, uh, need to get married this afternoon...
fine. But under these circumstances,
you're going to need to find somebody else to officiate for you.
Hey, I never heard. Did you, uh, track down Aaron?
I guess he didn't want to be found.
guys, you gotta see this.
it's Frost. - You found him?
his phone was activated 12 days ago at a convenience store
on the corner of Western and washington... 3: 18 P. M.
3: 19, a man fitting Frost's description
walks to a 1971 Citroen DS sedan...
powder blue, silver top.
a match from the shelter.
wait a minute.
Dyson Frost made a videotape for you 19 years ago,
then encoded a phone number for you to find.
and then after all that, instead of meeting with you,
he's murdering a homeless guy?
but he used my gun to do it.
he may be crazy, but he isn't random.
there's a method here.
we just don't understand what it is yet.
any word from the L. A.P. D. on the search for Frost's vehicle?
still looking. - I'll stay on top of it.
well, let's keep putting the pressure on.
guys, can we stop with the shoptalk?
this is a special occasion. - It's just like Demetri to be late for his own wedding.
he's not answering his cell.
I called three times.
let me try.
Demetri Noh. Leave a message.
nothing. - What is it?
guys, where is he?
...Ticket booth right by the entrance.
don't forget to buy your raffle tickets...
get some cotton candy!
Hey, sweetie. - Hi, mom!
Hey, step right up, ladies and gents.
wheel of fortune... one spin for three tickets.
you want to give me? Round and round she goes,
and where she stops, nobody knows.
Hey.
Hey. Where are you?
school, uh, carnival.
well, listen, I'm calling because I'm not gonna make it.
I need you to keep Charlie. - Oh. How come?
something's happened to Demetri. - What?
not sure what it is yet. He didn't show up at the wedding.
I just thought you should know.
what do you think happened?
I don't know. I hope it's just cold feet,
because it's almost March 15th, and this is too close for comfort.
Olivia? - Yeah?
be careful. - Of course.
kiss Charlie for me. - I will.
hang on, kids.
Hello, Charlie.
it would seem our fates are on a collision course.
find Dyson Frost yesterday.
the next move is Mark Benford's.
it's your move.
I took this picture.
she saw something she shouldn't have and got in trouble with Jericho.
the second that Jericho knows that I'm still alive...
they'll find me, and they'll kill me.
Tracy Stark-- I know you took her.
now you're gonna give her back.
I can't give you your daughter back.
then we go to war.
you will be shot 3 times on March 15th.
it will be your gun, agent Benford.
Demetri? - Yeah?
the box is here, but the gun is gone.
my first term was a bitch.
I could have used you, Stan.
I'm sorry I couldn't bring you in.
I don't want you to think I- I'm harassing you.
I know. You're just trying to save the world.
good-bye.
she was signaling her handlers.
I should have known-- two moles, in case one is caught
and not one person in the office would suspect it's you.
today is more than just the beginning of your career.
today, along with a badge and a gun, you're gonna get a story about your first day on the job.
every special agent has one.
some are funny. Some are tragic. Some are boring.
but today won't be the most important day in your career as an FBI agent.
that day is somewhere down the line.
you won't see it coming. It sneaks up on you.
it'll most likely be an anonymous moment-- a crossroads where you're asked to do something,
make some kind of personal sacrifice for the good of someone else,
and that person may never know your name or see your face or even understa what you did.
but you'll know.
and isn't that why you're here, after all?
because you can be counted on to do the right thing at the right time, every time.
welcome to the FBI.
well done.
nicely done.
all right, ladies and gentlemen. See me for your partner assignments.
Congratulations.
nicely done.
special agent Vreede-- is it "Vreed-y" or "Vreede" as in "Freed"?
Oh, I don't know.
I got Benford.
no. Switch with me. - Why?
he's a legend. He's done it all-- surveillance, counterterrorism, trafficking.
come on. Do it.
whatever, but you gotta take it up with wedeck and get it approved.
done. Thank you. - Of course.
Yes! Janis, who'd you get?
no partner. Headed to analysis.
boring. - You know, I got it worse.
I report to you.
I mean, how could that be? I scored higher.
Yeah, in, like, one category.
come on, Marcie. We'll have fun.
Yeah, we've been a team since Quantico-- booze and bullets.
Yeah, well, what am I, the mascot?
no, you're like our captain.
Yeah, you'll probably outpace all of us. I'm sure of it.
Yeah, we're--we're sure.
interview of Marcie Turoff, agents Benford and Noh questioning.
march 12, 2010.
first thing we'd like to know is-- who came after us in that parking garage in D. C?
I don't know.
who came after us in the parking garage in D. C?
I don't know.
on to the next. - Are they still afts?
I don't know. - Demetri.
who killed Ian Mckinnon? - Come on. Let's go.
is that who's coming after me?
let's go.
we need those answers.
Yeah, but there are a whole lot of other ones we need to get to first.
listen, Dem.
you think i don't have March 15th circled in my calendar, too?
we both know there's a chance you'll die in three days.
look, you keep chasing down leads.
I'll let you know when we're ready for your questions, all right?
Hey, Janis, I need your help in here with Marcie. - Me?
what, you got something more important than grilling our mole?
no. Of course not.
what were your duties?
every week, I'd take whatever information there was in the Mosaic investigation and leave it at a dead drop.
who recruited you?
I was approached by a man three months before the blackout hit.
what was his name?
all in due time.
he asked if I wanted to be a part of something big.
and you said yes.
you think I sold out my friends and my country, but you don't know me.
why don't you enlighten us?
come on. Don't you rember my flash-forward?
no, you don't, 'cause neither of you ever bothered to ask me what I saw.
I was incarcerated.
that didn't cross your mind when you shot six of your fellow agents?
it did.
but even though I was in jail, I was happier than I've been in years.
I thought we'd have to beg for life without parole.
I told you they'd come around.
until I tell them who recruited me, I'm indispensable.
for the first time since I got here, I actually felt like I was important.
I need you Mark.
these are our guests from Washington.
and while they're grateful for all our efforts in apprehending agent Turoff...
Oh, no. You gotta be kidding.
director Middleton feels more comfortable having such a highly valued target where he can keep an eye on her.
and where he can give the press conferences himself.
hear me out. We know her. We can read her.
just give us one more day.
I know it's frustrating, but let's try to get something positive done today
like maybe get back to what caused the blackout.
now I'll be out of the office for a couple of hours, so give me an update.
Dyson Frost-- He's our best lead so far. Where are we?
I've left four messages. Haven't heard back.
I'm afraid he's just toying with us.
the guy's been wanting to talk to you for 19 years, and now he's playing hard to get?
shel, see what you can get by tracing Frost's phone.
Yes, sir.
Hey, I just got a call from L.A.P.D. They've got a ballistics report saying that Mark's gun,
the one that's supposed to kill me in three days, was used in a muer last night.
so what do we know from the eyewitness reports?
55-year-old, in his cot, presumably asleep.
at 3: 33 a. m.the shooter walked up to him, and a couple of insomniacs heard the victim say...
I knew it would be you.
I just didn't want to believe.
the shooter must have had a silencer on your gun.
he plugged him three times in the chest at close range.
uh, do you want to put that thing away?
sorry. - Thanks.
physical description ranging from... 5'5" white guy to a 6' Indian.
another dead end.
wasn't there something about a car?
somebody said they saw a 1970s blue sedan drive away-- Foreign Make.
that's a start.
L.A.P.D.'s gonna forward the victim's effects to us.
can't wait to sift through that.
forget about the shooter.
who's the one other person we know who handled that gun?
there were 40 agents in that evidence room.
they were all cleared months ago.
one of those agents Marcie?
Marcie! Stop! Stop!
you guys never give up.
I need to talk to her. - She's in our custody now.
you can't take her. She's part of our investigation.
I'm just doing my job, same as you doing yours.
who'd you give my gun to, Marcie?
I don't know. - Come on. Who has it?
I don't know.
come on. Don't do this. We were friends.
look, I'm sorry. Really, I am.
all I heard is that you're supposed to die in L.A.
what?
give me more specifics. Who does it? When?
it was a voice on the phone when I called to report the gun in lockup.
who'd you call? - A number. It was different every time.
look, that's all I know. There isn't any more.
look, you're gonna die in three days, and there's nothing you can do to stop it.
I'm sorry.
come on.
Marcie, come on. - Marcie! Marcie! Marcie!
come on, come on!
sweetie, what is the hurry? We're here.
I told him we'd be here by 2: 00. We're late.
who? - Dylan!
Hey, Dylan.
nuts to you, squirrlio!
Toot! Toot! - Toot! Toot!
come on, dylan! - Okay, I'm coming.
did you know about this?
absolutely not.
Charlie, who arranged this?
I did! I got Dylan's phone number from him when he was in the hospital.
he was very insistent about this specific park, and now I know why.
do you normally come here?
well, the house is just around the corner.
right.
this is fun. - Come on. You go first.
look, I-I can sit on a bench or something.- It's fine.
doesn't have to be that way.
Dylan, what happened? - Let me see, sweetie.
we bonked heads.
did he hit your teeth?
let me see, baby.
okay, Charlie, let's see. Open up. - Sorry, Charlie.
I'm bleeding.
okay. Let me see.
she okay?
open your mouth.
here we go, charlie. I want you to do something now.
just--just grab my hand, and when it hurts, I want you to squeeze as hard as possible, okay?
is that all you got? Come on. You try a little bit harder than that.
that's good.
does this mean I can't go to the carnival, mommy?
no, I think you're gonna be just fine for the carnival.
I think you're gonna be okay.
Yeah, that's good. I'm starting to feel that a bit now.
listen, I'm just gonna go back to the car and get a bottle of water and a towel.
you'll be okay. - Okay.
Yeah. I see carnivals in your future. Come here.
I wanna go. - I know. Come here.
it's okay, sweetie.
assistant director Wedeck?
that's me.
come this way.
she's ready for you. - Thank you.
Madame vice president.
good to see you, Stan.
it's been quite a while.
please sit. - Thank you.
thanks for coming on such short notice, Stan.
how is everything?
you want to tell me why the hell you dragged me out here?
it's nice to know my new position hasn't changed your attitude towards me.
does the name Jericho ring a bell?
they're a private contractor operating over in Afghanistan.
I've heard of them.
agent Benford look into them a back.
yes?
well, in my security briefing this morning, I learned that Jericho's C.E.O.
just tripled the security around his malibu compound.
I think you should take a look.
wrong department. NSA is who you want to call.
I don't want them to know.
I need this done off the books.
the vice president doesn't fly across the country 'cause some guy hired an extra night watchman.
in my vision, it was clear that Jericho had done some things that threatened our national security.
the same vision where you saw yourself as president?
as a matter of fact, yes.
and I was there because Jericho did something that triggered a political cris.
I can't find out anything about what they're doing.
but if it's bad enough to bring down president Segovia, it must be significant.
I've been keeping a close eye on every move they make, and something is happening right now.
are you sure you don't know what it is even if I did, dave and I go back 25 years.
listen, these flash-forwards are coming true.
segovia is going down.
do you want to be out with the old or in with the new?
well, now we know your gun's here in L.A.
Yeah, too bad Marcie couldn't tell us who's using it.
so I'll run this car info, see if anything pings on a 1970s blue sedan.
we're gonna get this guy.
Yeah.
got a second?
jericho-- you used our database to look into them a few months ago.
is that a problem? - No, no. Just curious why you did.
it was a favor for a friend-- wanted as much information as I could give him, which wasn't a lot.
a friend?
do all your friends ask you to research third world military contractors?
he had questions about his daughter's death.
she was serving in Afghanistan.
he thinks Jericho is involved?
the things he told me-- they were in confidence.
I caspect that.
Thanks.
do you mind if i talk with him?
maybe ask him a few questions?
what's his name?
good luck finding him.
he's off the grid. I don't even know where he is or how to track him down.
thank you, Mark. - Sure.
just heard on the scanner L.A.P.D.'s in the middle of a high-speed chase.
Driver--Ross Webber-- has been spotted with a gun.
car they're following-- '71 blue sedan.
the shooter from the homeless shelter?
how many criminals are driving the same disco era sedans, right?
any idea where they're headed?
there's your blue sedan.
where is he? - Right inside
a bunch of people ran out. He's got hostages.
where in the building is he? - Second floor.
who's talking to him? - No one yet.
you think he's just gonna come out on his own?
captain doesn't want us to do anything till he gets here.
shots fired! Get down! Stay down!
you hang back.
I talk to him, try to make sure he releases the hostage.
once he does, you take your shot.
sounds good, except for the part about me staying on the sidelines.
no way you're going down there.
listen, I'm not gonna let that gun kill one more person.
march 15th--I know that's the day you're supposed to die.
who says you didn't get shot three days earlier?
who the hell is that?!
I'm right here!
try not to shoot me.
stop.
I told them the only person I want to talk to is randy savage!
macho man?
Yeah, I dig that.
uh, that's not me. My name's Demetri.
Oh, god!
you don't turn around in four seconds, I will kill her, Demetri.
doesn't matter to me. She's just a saleswoman.
that's what she gets for causing the blackout.
I said stop!
okay.
Ross, you still have that gun, right?
I'm gonna take the clip off now.
here we go.
gone, buddy.
and, uh... On my ankle, I got a gun, man.
I'm gonna take that off, too, okay?
we're not worrying about that anymore.
Hey, what were you saying, though, about...
about how salespeople caused the blackout? That's-- that's a fascinating theory.
I'd like to hear more about it.
they made us buy cell phones.
see, before everybody had a cell phone, nobody ever blacked out.
none of this ever--stop moving!
okay. - you think I won't kill you?
you're about just plain incorrect.
I'm not afraid.
it's okay.
everybody's scared of dying, man.
she is.
look at her... I'm scared of dying... All three of us.
it's what makes us human, don't you think?
you're scared.
that's fine.
see, when people get scared, judgment gets clouded.
I'll be honest, man.
you have made some really bad decisions today.
but you can make a really good one right now...
if you just give me the gun.
come on.
let me save your life.
E.M.T. says he's stable. We can question him in the hospital.
it's not your gun.
serial number is totally different.
your gun's still out there.
so you almost got yourself killed for nothing?
Yeah, I guess so.
all right.
you took him down, saved an innocent woman.
that's fantastic work.
what I can't understand is, if you thought that gun was gonna kill you, I mean...
cops had the place surrounded. He was never gonna make it out of here anyway.
that's why I needed to get to him, man-- so I could ask him why.
do you rember... That speech you gave my first day on the job?
it was all about being the kind of person who could be counted on to do the right thing at the right time.
and, man, since October 6th, when I didn't see anything, I have had a lot of trouble being that person.
and I need your help.
Why? I mean, look at me.
if you think i've been making good choices lately, you're crazier than I thought.
I'll do anything to help you, Demetri, so I'm gonna tell you something, and I really want you to listen.
get out of here.
you and Zoey just get out of here.
I'm not running away.
that's right. You're not.
you're being smart.
just promise me you'll go somewhere safe.
special agent Noh, do you recognize exhibit "H"?
Yes. It's a copy of my notes taken while witnessing the transaction.
and those handwritten notes are your only record of the events?
well, it was a very simple money-for-stolen-goods exchange.
that is very good.
agent Noh, who taught you to draw?
I guess I'm just naturally artistic.
lucky guy, right?
now your description here of the alleged buyer
Oh, here, further down in your notes-- can you read that for the court, please?
uh, "Aaucasian male, average height/weight, dark jacket, baseball cap."
when my client was booked, he was photographed wearing a red jacket, not a dark one, wasn't he?
Yes. - And he clearly has a goatee, does he not, agent Noh?
Yes.
so which individual bought the stolen computer disk, agent Noh
the one with the goatee, or the one in your artistic notes?
because they're obviously not the same person.
Objection-- argumentative.- Sustained.
do I get to answer that?
not really. No further questions.
I'm done with this witness.
Oh, you can go now.
come on. There's no need to take it personally.
that was a win that you just turned into a loss.
it was never really a win, because you were wrong.
you know what?
um, I'm gonna go ahead and take the stairs.
you know what? Look, I'm--I'm sorry.
I will turn the defense attorney off.
okay, that would be an instant improvement.
why don't you let me make it up to you?
can I... Take you to dinner?
you gotta be kidding me.
what?
there's not a chance in hell I would ever go out with you.
how are you?
good.
sit down. I want to talk to you.
it's okay.
you're beautiful.
shut up.
what is wrong with you?
nothing.
it's good.
you know, I wasn't supposed to be there that day.
what day?
al gough was supposed to be Mark's partner.
I switched with him, and because I was Mark's partner, I was covering the bust that led me to you.
all these tiny little decisions we make, you know, without thinking,
they--they all-- they all line up to lead us somewhere...
somewhere good.
Yeah. - So I want to ask you if you will...
marry me.
baby, we covered this. I-I said yeah.
no, I want to get married right now.
okay. - I want to get married tomorrow.
then we get on a plane and we go to Hawaii.
we stay there through the 15th, maybe through April 29th.
listen, maybe we don't ever come home.
want to do it?
are you serious? - I'm serious.
hell, yes!
yes? - Of course!
Oh, I love you.
I--sorry. I just wanted to come by and say thanks for what you did with Charlie today in the park.
okay, um... No problem.
well, thank you.
can I-- can I get you to come in?
I just left the water running, but please, please come in.
sure.
I'm sorry. The dishes were getting kind of out of control.
can I get you something to drink?
um, I could offer you a carton of milk that expired yesterday, some juice boxes or a bottle of gin.
no. No, I think I-- I think I should be going.
Really? - Yeah.
thank you for today.
Yeah, I do have a telephone.
you could've called to say thank you.
Olivia... Why are you here?
I've just made such a mess of things.
I wish I could blame it all on Mark, but I really can't.
I made a ton of mistakes.
I know that feeling.
I tried my best with Linda after Dylan was born, but...
to be honest, I-I used his autism as an excuse to get away from her.
even the thought of that makes me ashamed now.
I thought I was doing the right thing at the time.
you're damned if you do, and then you're damned if you don't.
Yeah, maybe we just... Choose to live in the moment, you know, just grab the...
good things in our life when we recognize them.
I have to go.
look. Wait. I'm not trying to argue against Mark.
he's a brave man doing something extraordinary.
Yeah, he is.
this does kind of put me in the lancelot-trying-to- persuade-guinevere position.
Oh, you did not just compare yourself to Lancelot.
Yeah, well, the only other metaphor I had involved protons and neutrons,
and believe me, under the circumstances, I went with the stronger choice.
I know that we're feeling the same thing right now.
how do you know what I'm feeling?
because I'm in that room on April the 29th.
that wasn't an accident.
this scares me.
it should.
who the hell you?
it's okay, Aaron.
I work with Mark.
I'm a friend.
you mind telling me how you found me?
there was a computer in Echo Park doing web searches for a "Jericho Parwan Afghanistan, Jericho Central Base" and "Jericho Murder U.S. Soldiers."
that library's 2 miles from here.
and this is the 14th cash-only hotel I've hit.
well, here I am. Now what?
mark didn't want to tell me why you were so interested in Jericho.
but some very powerful people would love to take them down.
all they need is proof.
they got my daughter.
they kill her? - They tried.
she's still alive.- But in your file it
try's alive.
she was here, but Jericho found her and to her back to Afghanistan.
I gotta believe I've only got so much time left to find her.
wait. You're--you're-- you're going to Afghanistan?
sure am.
I know you were in the service and everything, but how are you planning on getting there?
fly into Uzbekistan, cross the border at Termez.
and you're doing this with a U.S. Passport?
Yeah.
you'll be dead before you leave Hairaton.
I don't have a choice.
do you know why Jericho tried to kill your daughter two years ago?
she saw Jericho wipe out an entire village.
if I could help you get to Tracy... Do you think she would tell us the whole story?
Really? You can do that legally?
Hey, Demetri.
come here. - What?
come here.
yo, I'm getting married.
come here.
I'm getting married.
so would you be okay with Vreede officiating at your wedding?
define "okay."
no charge.
consider it my wedding gift.
you're gonna marry him?
Vreede's an internet minister.
have I ever told you how awesome you are, Shelly Vreede?
you make me feel awesome.
Janis, you're awesome, too.
Oh, thank you. Janis is awesome. - Thank you.
that's very sweet.
all right.
mark is awesome.
time to take the groom home.
all right. - Yeah.
let's find a cab.
here we go, buddy. - All right.
okay, i'm sleepy.
Yeah. good night.
you got military clearance.
your cover is you're in Afghanistan to help install their power grid.
satellite phone.
video capability.
as soon as you can document what Tracy knows, I want it uploaded.
if you see any Jericho activity, I want it uploaded-- pictures, video, audio, anything you can get me.
no problem. - Get yourself to bagram as soon as you're clear.
military transports leave every two days.
I'll arrange a flight home.
excellent. - I'm guessing...
you don't need me to tell you what to do with these.
I got a couple ideas.
Ah, all this gear is clean.
none of it can be traced back to this agency.
if they find you... You're on your own.
is that it?
I guess it is.
thank you, Stan.
this isn't something I think I need to tell you, but there's a very good chance you're never coming back.
I saw myse with my daughter.
we were together in Afghanistan, and she was alive.
God help anyone who stands in my way.
do you think I'm chicken for running away?
sometimes the best offense is a good defense.
no, Janis, I'm just scared.
you played this out as best as you cou everybody needs a successful exit strategy.
this is yours.
Hey, um... I want you to know, um...
that night in Somalia-- oh, Demetri, don't.
no, I want to. I-I have to-- stop.
just stop.
no, uh, this may be my last chance, all right?
I'm pregnant.
what?
Oh, my Gosh.
this is perfect.
my mom is gonna be so excited.
well, I'm happy to let you use the space, but since you aren't members here,
and, uh, since we didn't do any premarital counseling
Oh, we don't need any premarital counseling.
we've been living together for a year.
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.
listen, you, uh, need to get married this afternoon-- fine.
but under these circumstances, you're going to need to find somebody else to officiate for you.
Hey, I never heard. Did you, uh, track down Aaron?
I gus he didn't want to be found.
guys, you gotta see this.
it's Frost. - You found him?
his phone was activated 12 days ago at a convenience store on the corner of western and Washington--3: 18 p. m.
3: 19, a man fitting Frost's description walks to a 1971 citroen ds sedan-- powder blue, silver top.
a match from the shelter.
wait a minute.
Dyson frost made a videotape for you 19 years ago, then encoded a phone number for you to find.
and then after all that, instead of meeting with you, he's murdering a homeless guy?
but he used my gun to do it.
he may be crazy, but he isn't random.
there's a method here.
we just don't understand what it is yet.
from the L.A.P.D. On the search for Frost's vehicle?
still looking. I'll stay on top of it.
well, let's keep putting the pressure on. I mean, I really
guys, can we stop with the shoptalk?
this is a special occasion.
it's just like Demetri to be late for his own wedding.
he's not answering his cell.
I called three times.
let me try.
Demetri Noh. Leave a message.
nothing.
what is it?
guys, where is he?
...ticket booth right by the entrance.
don't forget to buy your raffle tickets...
corn dogs! Every penny goes to the school!
Hey, sweetie.
Hi, mom!
Hey, step right up, ladies and gents.
wheel of fortune-- one spin for three tickets.
you want to give me?
round and round she goes, and where she stops, nobody knows.
where are you?
uh, school, uh, carnival.
well, listen, I'm calling because I'm gonna make it.
I need you to keep Charlie.
how come?
something's happened to Demetri.
what?
not sure what it is yet. He didn't show up at the wedding.
I just thought you should know.
what do you think happened? - I don't know.
I hope it's just cold feet, because it's almost March 15th, and this is too close for comfort.
yeah?
be careful.
of course.
kiss Charlie for me.
I will.
uh, hang on, kids.
Hello, Charlie.
they got my daughter.
she was here, but jericho found her and took back to afghanistan.
you're going to afghanistan?
sure am.
it's about the raven river experiments.
that's what my friend wanted to talk to you about. he texted you.
what do you know about the text?
the flash-forwards... The blackout... We can't solve it without you.
we engineered thousands of flash-forwards.
we have to protect ourselves from the effects of another blackout.
we have to anchor consciousness if another wave happens.
you' gonna be saved by the lady you see every day.
I have to get pregnant now.
I wantthatbaby. i want this specific child.
it was supposed to happen this weekend.
if it's baby-making you need, i will take one for the team.
that night in somalia-- - oh, demetri.
I'm pregnant.
I reviewed your uncle teddy's autopsy x-rays.
you murdered him to send a message.
message received.
I should have known--two moles, in case one is caught.
and not one person in the office would suspect it's you.
the yellow brick road-- a 6-mile killer obstacle course.
every quantico graduate dreads it, but we all do it.
I never intended to be an fbi agent.
I was a lawyer and hated my life.
then i had this friend who joined the bureau.
stop being such a girl!
Oh, stop being such a bitch!
I never thought of myself as particularly patriotic.
but it sounded cool.
I like the idea of being part of something, actually trying to make the world a safer place.
nice going.
you're not gonna tell everybody i almost didn't make it, right?
no, i'm just gonna show 'em this picture.
last one to the barbed wire is a wuss.
that was a $5 camera!
I loved it. i loved every second of it.
Quantico made me strong.
it taught me what mattered, and it showed me i'm capable of tackling problems i never thought possible.
of course, i've never lived in los angeles, so we'll see how i survive this.
I'm sure you'll do just fine.
are you married?
Oh, no.
I don't really have time for a serious relationship.
good to know.
I'm sorry.
I've been going on and on.
um, what was your name again?
I'm lita.
we'll take two more.
so what do you do?
I'm a headhunter.
I find talented people like yourself and... Offer them opportunities.
well, i just started at the bureau, and i'm not really looking to quit.
who said anything about quitting?
I know all about your job.
I'm just talking about a little multitasking.
the originals are being analyzed by forensics right now.
the only other thing of potential relevance is frost's final bon mot
in the end you'll be saved by the lady you see every day.
I can't speak on balf of everyone, but i'm still contemplating the unbelievable fact that we had the possible mastermind of the global blackout in our hands, and just before he's able to divulge any real information, he's killed by a terrorist who, just mere hours before, was in our custody.
now how the hell does that happen?
I don't know. what i do know is demetri noh is alive.
Yeah, and alda's free again, which means demetri was right all along
that she's been involved in this thing since the beginning, even before you guys started surveilling her.
believe me, i want her back just as much as you do.
in the meantime, frost did confirm that there will be another blackout.
he was coming in from the cold, and these blueprints and photographs are what he was bringing with him.
that alone makes them vital to our investigation.
this man was insane.
how do we know that anything he's even giving us is credible?
because crazy as he was, he was always true to his word.
but if you want to kick over more anthills
mark, this isn't about what i-- - can we please dial back the testosterone?
that's enough.
thank you.
Janis is running point on photos and blueprints, high priority.
shel, dem said frost referenced something called raven river as the place where the flash-forwards started happening.
see what you can find out about it.
this tracks something i was already running down.
so keep running.
when demetri gets back, he can jump in with you.
look, we're clearly on the right track.
the bad guys were obviously desperate to keep us from getting to frost.
let's take that as a sign we're getting warmer and push on.
okay, soa9 run his labs.
start an i. V. i'll be there in ten minutes.
Yeah. bye.
it's important, olivia!
how did you get in here?
I know you. - my husband is fbi, okay?
so there's an agent right out front.
I'm gonna call him, and he's gonna take you-- - the pixies. the pixies.
you were there. you were there.
you wore a purple beret.
the drink spilled on the lady in front. she got mad. she got so mad.
I was there, too, with my handler, barry.
Barry lost his job for taking me to a pixies concert.
they closed with "wave of mutilation.
the summer after med school?
I was at scott's wedding at the vineyard.
remember scott's wedding at the vineyard?
your dress was turquoise. you cried.
it was sad. it was ssad.
they served mini corn dogs.
I don't know who you are. what do you want from me?
I'm gabriel mcdow. i told you that.
I said--i definitely said that already.
you have to remember things, olivia.
like i said, my husband is fbi, so there's an agent out front.
I'm gonna call him, and he's gonna take you away. - he's not your husband. lloyd
you know lloyd? lloyd is. - what?
Yeah, you made a mistake. you should be with lloyd.
I tried to stop you, only you don't know that, because i onlytriedto stop you.
I have to tell you all about it.
it was a thursday. there's so much i need to tell you.
it's all at raven river.
get the hell out of my house!
no, don't go! don't go!
the proof of the pudding is in the eating!
don't buy coffee today from the man that looks like mr. clean!
don't buy coffee today! don't buy coffee, today! - dan, there's a man in my house!
Janis, thank you for coming in on such short notice.
I'm worried about your baby.
Why?
I thought you said everything looked good.
you're anemic, and you haven't gained enough weight.
I want you to see a perinatologist to get a high-resolution ultrasound.
now she'll make sure that the placenta's okay and the baby is growing.
and what if it isn't?
first things first.
get that ultrasound, and get it soon.
you've got to protect your baby.
I can't believe this is happening right now.
Yeah, but, mark, he was in our house.
I mean, i could have been killed.
Charlie must have been terrified.
no, charlie was already at school.
why would this man be stalking you?
I don't know. l i know is that there's something incredibly wrong with him.
okay, look, i'm gonna have to call you back.
soon. - okay. bye.
Ralph, what happened?
some teenager driving and texting jumped a curb and hit a couple people waiting for coffee out front.
he was going, like, 80.
doesn't look good.
don't buy coffee today from the man that looks like mr. clean!
Oh, my god.
can i help you, hon?
Yeah. i'm looking for some red flower dragon heads.
you mean some red dragon flowerhorns?
Yeah.
do you have any here?
I might. do you have a freshwater tank oraltwater?
I'm sorry. i was supposed to ask for carline.
that's me.
um... I'm janis.
lita sent me to you. - i know.
so let's get you set up with an aquarium, shall we?
Yeah, i don't actual really need an aquarium.
I think a 5-gallon tank ought to do the trick.
we got your blue coral here, a power supply, air filter, water conditioner, a couple of plants and some incandescent bulbs.
I'm a little confused.
honey, if you're going to be coming in here every couple of weeks to talk to me, then you need an excuse.
Yeah, i don't really like fish.
you do now.
so what do you think-- neon tetras or zebra fish?
the... Tetras, i guess.
I'm sorry. what exactly is it that i'm supposed to be doing?
well, for now, your job.
be the best special agent at the l. A. bureau that you can be.
watch, wait, win their trust.
and while you're at it, keep us apprised of what they're up to.
now these swordtails can be very aggressive.
sometimes they eat each other.
fish are like that.
here we go.
the photos that we found on frost are platinum prints, which dates the photos between 1890 to 1917.
but the guy from the getty says that it's likely the latter part of that time period.
we were able to recover two sets of prints
frost's, of course, and alda hertzog's.
alda? how would she have gotten her hands on these photos?
maybe she was with him before he met with you?
no.
she barely would have had time to make it to the desert before killing frost.
they must have crossed paths even earlier.
another weird thing-- forensics analyzed these photos and the blueprints for trace chemicals, and they found particulate matter specific to soil in the kunar province of afghanistan.
Yep, u.S. department of agriculture keeps a soil database.
what would frost be doing in afghanistan?
don't look so alarmed.
you will only draw more attention.
who are you?
I'm here at the request of our mutual friend stanford wedeck.
you're malik? - and you are looking for your daughter.
but now is not the time to exchange biographies.
we need to leave.
you already said that.
those men over there-- one of them is making a phone call.
the best outcome of that call is a man on his way here to kidnap you.
the worst--that man with a bomb strapped to his chest.
I believe that is what you call a loselose situation.
you don't blend as well as you think.
thank you, professor corey, for looking at these.
if these blueprints can be authenticated, this would be an incredibly cool find.
kind of reminds me a lot of the antikythera mechanism.
I'm not familiar with that.
it's one of the great mysteries of modern science.
it was a bronze artifact discovered in the mediterranean in 1901.
turned out to be this incredibly sophisticated sort of calculator from second century b. C. greece.
they've got it on display at the national archaeology museum in athens.
and you think this is something like that?
Yeah, looks like it.
the antikythera calculated dates of solar eclipses, but i'll be damned if i can figure out what this calculates.
if you'll let me keep these, i'll scan them, do some 3-d imaging, translate the ancient greek and, uh, see what i can come up with.
call me when you know something.
who has copies of these?
we've got an antiquities professor studying the originals right now, and benford's got a copy on his board.
get them back.
what do you mean?
I mean get me the original and destroy every copy that's been made.
what's so important about this thing?
I don't recall answering questions being part of our arrangement.
the inrmation goes one way, period.
get me these blueprints.
sweetie, you want me to make you that frozen pizza?
no. i'm all full on popcorn.
okay. squirrlio.
I'll give you 20 bucks for it.
what are you doing?
what are you doing, janis?
I totally screwed up, mark.
that's an understatement.
you broke into my office, and you're removing things from the mosaic board.
I know. i'm an idiot.
professor corey called me.
professor corey?
the antiquities professor.
he misplaced the blueprints that i gave him.
so make him another copy.
I gave him the originals. you have the only other copy.
you didn't check the originals into evidenc no.
I had a doctor's appointment, so i just brought 'em with me.
how'd you get in?
you gave me your passcode. - wh?
that time... You were in washington with wedeck, and you need me to get...The geyer file for you.
right.
this is a rookie mistake, janis.
hand back the blueprints. you can get your copies tomorrow.
you should know better.
I know. i'm sorry.
I'm telling you, shel, he seemed to know a lot about me.
I mean, look, there he is again.
and you're sure you don't know this guy?
no, believe me. i would have rembered him.
that's weird.
and he brought up raven river again, like he did the other day.
do you have any idea what that is?
Yeah.
that's an interesting thing. there's a suspect we were tracking with the mosaic investigation.
well, he had mentioned something about raven river to demetri, so i did some research.
well, that's crazy. does mark know about this?
I'm putting the report together for him now.
there's a few raven rivers.
there's one in wisconsin, one in illinois.
there's a tennis club in ohio and a raven river hospital in arizona.
well, what kind of hospital?
psych hospital. it's been shut down for about 20 years now, and there was some controversy in the late '80s--abuses.
what kind of patients?
schizophrenics, and they were the first hospital in the country to deal with autism.
autism?
W-what about savants?
she was trying to get away from them.
that's why she came home.
but jericho-- they got eyes everywhere.
now they brought her back here.
how do you know they have not killed her?
I know.
you have proof?
she's alive.
I've seen it.
you seem confident in your beliefs.
I envy you.
you must know that what you're asking is no smallundertaking.
kandahar is not baghdad, mr. stark.
it's not even kabul.
finding a single person anywhere in this country is next to impossible.
there was someone else there, someone think can lead us to her.
who? - his name's khamir dejan.
he's a doctor-- friend of tracy's.
he knows the location where i found her.
we find him, he can lead us there.
it's not that simple. evenf he is in this region, it will take time.
where she was, there was writings on the wall.
does that mean anything to you?
eyes on the mountain.
it's a medical relief organization, nongovernmental.
you said that khamir was a doctor.
Yeah.
this group--they have bases all over the country.
if he is working for them, we can find him.
and the roadblocks?
I know all of them. i know how to get around them.
where do we start?
we head south towards the mountains.
I've seen the test results from dr. weaver.
let's have a look, shall we?
there's your baby, and there's the heartbeat.
is she okay?
is she too small?
no, the head size is normal.
placental blood flow, it's--it's okay.
but the abdominal girth isn't what i'd want to see.
I know your work is very demanding, janis, but you're going to need to take better care of yourself.
get eight to ne hours of sleep a night, eat a high-protein diet and...
reduce your stress.
you know those are not supposed to be on in here.
look, i know life is complicated. everyone's is.
but the health of your baby depends on your ability to - -to stay off your feet and lower your stress.
I'm serious. otherwise, you could lose this baby.
I'm sorry. i have to take it. it's my boss.
Hey, mark.
professor corey's sitting in my office, and he's just given me some very interesting information.
I think you better get back here.
professor corey.
ms. hawk. weirdest thing happened yesterday.
therwas a power failure in the entire building, erased every hard drive in the joint.
Really? - yeah.
and i can't seem to find those blueprints you gave me...
which is why it's a damn good thing i took pictures on my phone and printed 'em out.
I wanted to get a head start.
great.
I, uh, did some quick and dirty 3-d imaging of the device.
seems to be some kind of mechanical, astronomical clock...
with gears and levers designed to calculate a certain date, or rather, a series of dates.
what dates?
when i do the math, the first date i keep coming up with is october 6, 2009...
the date of the blackout.
Janis hawk. - it's benford. get wedeck. suspects are on the move.
mark, i'm putting you on speaker.
what do you got?
Khalid, omar and an unidentified caucasian woman.
we're e-mailing you pictures right now.
who is she?
uh, that's the "unidentified" part, sweetheart.
get these to digital forensics and run 'em by i. S.O.
okay. - thanks.
you've had a partial abruption, ms. hawk.
the good news is you've stopped bleeding.
you're gonna have to really watch your physical activity from here on out.
do you want to know the sex of your baby?
well, considering the circumstances...
get up - i want out. - it's normal to be upset.
millions of people died yesterday, carline.
I lost friends, people i know and work with.
nobody told me this was the plan when i was recruited.
you said there was gonna be an event, but you never said it would be like this.
did you know this was gonna happen?
I don't answer questions, janis.
we've already been over this.
I don't want to do this anymore.
I want outnow.
I'm really sorry you feel that way, janis, but you can't get out.
you're in way too deep.
surely you're bright enough to realize that.
you know, it's funny. i never heard you complaing when you were pocketing all that money.
you didn't think there was a price?
you're a despicable person.
man up, sweetheart.
this is what we do, and even if i wanted to cut you loose, that's not my call to make.
okay, then i want to talk to the person whose call it is.
that's not gonna happen... Ever.
if i were you, i'd go on home, pour yourself a couple of stiff ones, lick your wounds, because tomorrow i expect you back in here spilling your guts.
it's like the setting in one of those slasher movies.
I'm more of a clint eastwood type guy, myself.
I hope you told someone where we were going.
Ah, so they'll know where to find our bodies?
here you go.
Oh, thank you.
mildew.
I'm gonna look around down here.
okay. you call me if you get lost.
you're not gonna find... What you're looking for there, olivia.
I knew you'd be here.
you're always here.
I'm heading out.
what's up with you? hmm?
you've been distracted.
you haven't been yourself.
you've been coming in late, disappearing for lengths of time.
what is it?
I'm pregnant.
that's... Congratulations.
your flash-forward really is coming true.
and there was a question of the health of the baby.
so i just... I don't know. i guess i just lost it.
I lost my edge.
but i'm okay.
everything's good.
great.
mark, i just hope that you know you can still count on me.
Janis... I never doubted that.
Thanks.
you know, i can't stop thinking about frost's last words
in the end, you'll be saved by the lady you see every day.
what the hell does that mean, hmm?
well, clearly, that means m gonna save your ass, mark.
no. i don't know.
maybe it means olivia's gonna save my ass.
let's go over this again.
what do we know about dyson frost?
we know he went under the alias "d. gibbons." - and he played chess brilliantly.
and faked his own death once upon a time.
D. gibbons escaped. we got a white queen.
chess...
the lady you see every day.
in chess, the queen's known as the lady, right?
no.
crazy son of a bitch was right.
your family?
I'm taking you where you want to go.
what else do you need to know?
how about what you saw? that's a start.
my wife and daughter-- we're in a car together.
we black out. the car goes over the embankment.
I survive.
it doesn't matter what i saw.
a future without them is no future at all.
I'm sorry.
you know, i envy that you believe in the possibility of good.
Taliban?
I don't know.
I thought you said you knew all the factions. isn'at why wedeck sent you to me?
I don't know this one.
I'll take care of it.
how'd you find me?
well, you... Don't blend in as well as you think.
my--my friend-- the one who texted you-- he--he was here.
we--we were here.- olivia!
we were here. he was here. we--we were here together.
you okay? - yeah.
do you understand now? tell--you understand now?
no, gabriel, i don't understand anything.
how--how did you know about the car accident at the hospital?
I sait.
well, what did you mean when you said that i made a mistake about lloyd?
uh, it's what i saw.
Lloyd and olivia sitting in a tree, k-i-s-- okay, stop.
stop.
s what i saw.
you saw it?
this is where they did it. - gabriel, where are you going?
this is where they did it.
this is where they did it.
where they did what? - this is where they did it... The experiments.
what experiments?
every other day for two years... We came here.
theyut us to sleep.
they put us to sleep.
I never knew where i'd end up.
sometimes it was a short trip.
I was eating a tuna sandwich.
cat jumped on the table. kitty likes tuna.
sometimes it was a long trip.
he watches from there.
who?
the doctor...
he told us we were special 'cause we could remember things... Everything.
and then when we came back, we had to write it all down, every--every little detail.
that's the way the cookie crumbles.
the...- Flash-forwards?
you're talking about flash-forwards.
he--he said we were special because we could remember the future.
I said that already. did i say that already?
I'm sorry i said that already. - it's okay. it's okay, gabriel - it's okay. - i said that already.
youarespecial. you're-- you're a savant. you all were.
he used you for your eidetic memories like human recorders.
when they finished with us...
when they used us all up...
he told them to kill us so we wouldn't tell.
he's dead now.
you don't have to be afraid of him anymore.
the early worm catches the bird.
I've been waiting.
I've been waiting. - gabriel, why have you been following me?
it's an emergency.
you're-- you're going the wrong way.
so i-i have to turn you around, olivia,'cause you're going the wrong way.
what wrong way?
in the futures i saw, i always sawyou, olivia.
me? - yeah, and you're always with lloyd.
at harvard, by the pipe shop, i-i tried to smoke that day, but i threw up.
and--and we were friends.
we were friends because i was the janitor in the-- no, gabriel.
I didn't go to harvard. i came to california. i went to u. C.L. A.
I married mark.
in the futures i saw, you're supposed to be with lloyd.
you're always with lloyd-- not that other one.
Lloyd.
harvard was a fork in the road.
you have to listen to me, olivia.
you have to--have to rember these things, because they're important.
you have to be here for things to come.
you're a piece of the puzzle. they--they can't solve it without you!
gentlemen, it's been p. E.T. scanned, c.T. scanned and subjected to neutron emissions analysis.
what the hell is it-- some kind of little electronic kryptonite?
no, no, no. this is more complicated.
our analyst is saying it makes our current tech look kind of primitive.
they have no idea what it is.
that's why i've invited simon and lloyd to join us.
suspect zero has one, too.
you think he and dyson frost were working together, huh?
possibly. we know that d. gibbons--frost-- made numerous calls during the blackout.
as far as we know, they were the only two people in the world awake during the blackout.
suspect zero was wearing a ring, and frost had this one in his possession.
it's a q. E.D. - what?
a quantum entanglement device.
my god. it exists.
this is what we were discussing in our flash-forwards.
english, gentlemen. english, please.
okay. let's start with the basics, all right?
theoretically, frost and his pals ramped up our linear accelerator to such extreme energies that it sent shock waves through the consciousness field and jolted all of humanity's awareness to a different place in space-time--the flash-forward.
now suspect zero and frost were awake during the time of the blackout, correct?
they were in some way protected.
clearly. so you think this ring
is a device which anchored their minds to their current location in space-time.
in other words, it helped them stay conscious.
you're saying this little thing kept those guys from blacking out?
maybe this is why they were so anxious to attack our offices on april 29th.
maybe they weren't coming for me. they were coming for this.
and nothat we know that, we can figure out a way to stop them.
Mr. vogel? janis hawk.
I was told to meet you by assistant director bramwell.
Yes, ms. hawk. please sit.
congratulations on graduating today.
surviving quantico is no small accomplishment.
thank you.
I was told this is about a special assignment, but i'm actually starting in the l. A. office next month.
ms. hawk, i'll get right to the point. i'm not with the bureau.
as i'm sure you're aware, historically, the bureau and the agency haven't always cooperated as closely as they might have.
we're trying to change that.
you're cia.
as a part of a still-classified operation, we've assessed your graduating class and found half a dozen candidates potentially vulnerable to hostile recruitment.
and i'm one of them? - yes.
your financial situation, your sexual orientation, your unconventional upbringing
they all make you a potential target.
well, that's ridiculous. you're wrong.

Oh, my God. Come quick! It's your sister Annabelle!
I want to come home.
taking Annabelle--that was never part of the deal.
you asked me to give you data, to tell you when we were running the experiment. That's all.
the deal is whatever we say it is.
Annabelle is just insurance.
what's that on his hand?
that looks like a ring.
a quantum entanglement device.
I'm Gabriel Mcdow. I told you that.
I said--I definitely said that already.
you have to remember things, Olivia.
Gabriel, why have you been following me?
you're going the wrong way.
the futures I saw, you're always with Lloyd.
you all know Fiona Banks, mi6.
none of them had visions, and now they're all dead.
the blue hand. No limits. No fear.
we KNOW YOU ARE ONE OF US - a death club? - Slingerland. Am I saying that right?
it says here you taught American history at south Fairfax high.
the script for this conversation has already been written.
whatever you've all seen is gonna happen.
now Celia's death was an accident, okay?
it could've happened to anyone.
what I saw doesn't have to play out that way.
I found a way to change the game.
two days before the blackout
you do realize you're wearing the same jacket you were wearing when we broke ground on the accelerator.
it was an accident, I suppose.
there are no accidents, Lloyd.
I detect some sublimated sentiment bubbling to the surface.
this is a big deal for both of us.
we've been working on tachyons for 12 years.
this is our moment, Simon.
go with it.
Cheers. - Cheers.
God, I hope it all works.
we're simulating the big bang.
what could go wrong?
excuse me. - Sure.
it's mum.
hello.
what?
when?
okay. Uh...
is Annabelle all right?
just, uh, just tell her I'll be on the first flight home.
Yeah.
okay, you, too. Bye.
uh...
my dad died.
activation in one minute.
the day of the blackout
this experience was designed by Dr. Campos, who, unfortunately, could not be with us on this day when we recreate the beginning of the universe.
Lloyd Simcoe, Dr. Campos' Mentor, the brain behind the brain
this is Angie Tremont from the "new science report."
a journalist? - It's all right. She's been cleared.
Oh, sorry. We have a rather strict confidentiality protocol, so we're a little wary of the press.
it's a pleasure to meet you, Dr. Simcoe.
Dr. Myhill's been telling me all about the project.
your crowning glory.
well, it's been a team effort.
uh, Gordon, the preliminary firings have started.
the big moment.
yes?
they're ready.
activation commencing in 30 seconds. - Initiate. Here goes nothing.Or everything.
activation commencing in 20 seconds.
activation commencing in 10 seconds...
the visions people had are really only just possible futures.
present Day Uh, the universe operates within certain parameters, but there is some flexibility.
with one week till the 29th, Dr. Simcoe, we are all still wondering what to expect.
well, it's a well-known precept in quantum physics that observations shape reality.
you're saying that seeing our futures may, in fact, change our futures.
uh, that's the theory, yes.
but the future does have a way of fighting back.
what do you mean by that?
small things may change, but the forces of the universe may be pushing us towards the futures we have seen.
that's interesting.
and what about the people who learned from mosaic they were meant to die before the 29th but lived past the fatal event?
well, those people are the statistical anomalies at the edge of the curve.
should you still be worried?
because it sounds like you're saying the universe may course-correct, that they might not have escaped their fates after all.
Yes, that's possible.
so maybe a better word for "course-correction" destiny"?
well, I'm just a scientist, I'm not really qualified to answer that question.
I'd like to welcome tonight's next guest-- Celia Quinones.
ms. Quinones is the young woman whose future was changed by the suicide of FBI agent all Gough
one of Dr. Simcoe's "statistical anomalies."
ms. Quinones, take us through your experience.
first, I-I would like to say again to the family of agent Gough how...grateful my family and I are for his actions.
um, in the first weeks after the blackout, I heard that not having a vision meant that I would be dead on april 29th.
when I discovered on the mosaic website that I would be hit by a car, I lived in constant terror that I might die at any moment.
but you didn't.
I'm sure a lot of people have questions, so let's open up the phone lines.
uh, Muncie, Indiana, you're on the air.
this question's for Dr. Simcoe.
is it possible the blackout caused permanent brain damage to anyone?
there's no reason to believe so.
well, people's lives have been ruined.
what if this happens again?
it is critical that people remain calm.
A-and--and I-I must repeat that no one's brain was damaged in any way by the blackout itself.
and let me reassure you it is impossible that there could be another blackout.
I almost believe him myself.
Yeah, tell me again why we're not telling people there's another blackout coming?
because we don't know when it's gonna happen.
we tell people but don't say when?
the world will turn into an armed camp.
so, Celia, you're confident that your future has changed?
I'm still here.
the universe seems to have a different plan for me.
thank you for joining us today.
any last words, Dr. Simcoe?
uh, come the 29th, I believe that we will end up where we're supposed to be.
supposed to be? - Thank you for speaking with us today.
that doesn't mean we can't decide our fate. - After the break, we'll be talking to...author of the award-winning book "teens and truth."
she's going to help us figure how to talk about...
stop! Stop!
that's my sister!
Annabelle! - Stop there!
Annabelle! - Stop, Simon!
don't come any closer or they'll kill me!
who? What? - They're watching.
they'll shoot me.
what? Who?
what do they want?
they said they want you and the ring.
they got your message, and they're sending one back.
you have 12 hours, or they'll kill me.
Annabelle. - Please, Simon.
give them what they want.
they were very specific.
you only have 12 hours to give them the ring or they will kill me.
get in the car. Just go.
Annabelle, I'm not leaving you here.
get in the car. - Annabelle...
just go! Please, just go!
let's go. Now.
tech wizard extraordinaire?
I'll take that as a "yes."
license plate? - You are good.
what I'd like to know is whose car that belongs to.
Yeah. Yeah, I can definitely do this.
simple. Just gotta run it by the head man.
that's the part of the process I'd like you to omit.
no can do.
name your price.
anything?
Hey, you. - Hey.
how do you always know when I'm here?
mm, stalking.
Internet. Paid informants. You know, the usual.
I, um, I brought you a book. The places that scare you
I wish...I wish you'd tell me when you're getting chemo.
I don't want you to feel obligated to come.
it's not an obligation.
L.A.P.D. Called.
someone claiming to be mi6 used my name to get access to a crime scene.
Hello, Demetri.
you're looking well. - You, too, Fiona.
so, uh, I'm guessing you didn't fly all the way in from London - just 'cause you missed me. - No.
andrew Weeks was supposed to die on March the 2nd from a drug allergy, but he survived the date.
he made a big deal out of it, too, huh?
his wife heard him fall, came running out and found him dead.
no sign of anyone coming in or out the house.
if I'm living on borrowed time, I might avoid a room full of guns.
except he wasn't shot.
he was bleeding from the mouth and nose, so forensics field-tested his coffee.
it showed positive for warfarin. - Rat poison?
that explains the bleeding.
I don't get it.
you got a room full of guns, and you poison a guy. Why?
weeks was supposed to die from a drug allergy, not a gunshot wound.
I think the killer was trying to get as close as possible to the original cause of death.
that was in his papers.
these are directions to a blue hand gathering.
that's why I'm here four blue handers dead in the L.A.Area in the last three weeks.
each knew exactly how and when they were supposed to die but lived past their death date.
I was in Anaheim investigating when I got word of this one.
you really think someone's to trying knock off survivors?
it's just a hunch.
what was I supposed to say?
well, yes, there's gonna be another blackout.
well, sorry, we just can't tell you when.
so you said what you had to.
I mean, people are terrified.
you gave 'em hope. - No, I gave them was a lie.
what would give people hope is if Simon and I could crack this Q.E.D. Technology.
then at least people wouldn't black out in the first place.
what about that caller who asked about brain damage?
I mean, I've never even considered that.
no. If the blackout could cause brain damage, we would've picked up on it a long time ago.
I know how much this is weighing on you.
I wish there was something I could do to help. - Olivia...
you already are.
you wanted to see me?
you may think that promising a junior analyst a weekend at the bunny ranch will get him to jeopardize his job, but it won't.
my sister ran away from home after the blackout.
I saw her this morning.
she was in a white van with that license plate.
so you just figured you'd have one of my agents help you out?
I have to find her.
we ran the plate.
van was stolen two days ago in San Francisco.
traffic cam... Picked this up.
now that's a nice story, Simon, but how about the truth?
you wanna tell me what the hell's going on?
I was trying to have her come with me.
the people she's with, they have some sort of...Hold over her.
you're lying.
she didn't run away. She was kidnapped.
look at her body language. She's terrified.
how long have you known about this? - I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, come on. Don't play games with me. This is your sister.
exactly. My sister.
that's why I'll do anything to find her.
that's what I'm afraid of.
someone knows you feel this way, they'll use it against you as leverage.
and considering what you know, I'd say they could get a lot.
are you suggesting I've been compromised?
I don't know what you've been, but I do know one thing-- you've been lying.
and now you've put the entire mosaic investigation in jeopardy.
what do you think?
something in the ring's structure has to be maintaining superposition.
it's keeping people awake-- but how?
you're not even listening.
"maintaining superposition" was what you said, and I have no idea.
we, do you want to focus a little?
we've done enough damage. Maybe we can put something right.
look, just because you feel guilty about lying on the news and want to save the world doesn't mean that we can actually make it happen.
Yes, we can, and it's not about feeling guilty.
Yeah, right. - No, it's about preventing more deaths.
Oh, it's all Lloyd Simcoe's fault, and now he can save the day.
it's a little messianic, don't you think?
what are you talking about?
Oh, millions of deaths.
it's overwhelming concept.
numbers like that-- you lose track of individuals. They fall through the cracks.
a single person doesn't even matter. Okay, now you're losing me.
my sister.
Annae? So what are you talking about?
she's been kidnapped.
when?
a few days after the blackout.
why would anyone kidnap your sister?
I have no idea. - What do the police say?
well, the FBI are on it. There's nothing more I can do.
well, why didn't you tell me? I would've helped.
Oh, yeah? How?
w-well, I don't know, but I-- now I just feel useless.
well it's not about you, Lloyd.
I had to deal with the situation as best I could for Annabelle.
now I'm sorry I didn't put you in the loop.
I've been kinda busy.
why would he hide the fact that his sister was kidnapped?
the polygraph's inconclusive.
you really think he's compromised?
there's nothing concrete, but...
look, Mark, I don't like this situation any more than you do, but we need Simon.
we'll look for his sister.
find her, and find out what they want from him.
I never thought we'd be talking to this guy again.
everyone, next week's reading...
schopenhauer.
Mr. Slingerland?
agent Noh.
I'm so glad to see you again.
this is inspector Banks.
I remember you, too. - Mr. Slingerland.
what's going on? - Do you recognize this man?
Yeah, that's Andrew.
Andy Weeks. I remember seeing him at the blue hand gatherings.
that was a while ago. I'm not really into that anymore.
why do you ask? - He's dead.
how? - Murdered.
poor Andy.
guess he thought he was in the clear.
but I suppose the universe has to, uh, banlance itself.
excuse me?
life is energy, you see.
as each new life begins, another ends.
and if you mess with that balance, the universe pushes back.
Andy was a good guy. I'm sorry.
we need you to put together a list of the blue handers who knew Mr. Weeks.
can you do that for us? - Be happy to.
and you might want to be careful.
we think someone's killing the people that lived past their death dates, people like you.
so you don't want me to go on television and announce it to the world?
just watch you back, is what we're saying.
I will, agent Noh.
gabriel' s blood work came back.
so besides his feet, everything seems okay.
the left foot looks good. His right still looks pretty bad.
okay, well, let's finish up the antibiotics, and we'll reevaluate tomorrow.
Where's Charlie?
Hey, you! Charlie' s at school.
what are you doing here?
uh, occupational therapy, which I completely forgot about.
Dylan was hoping to see you, and, um, so was I.
Hi. - Hi.
Lloyd Simcoe?
Lloyd? I knew it. I knew it.
I said it would happen. I saw it would happen.
I-I knew it. - I beg your pardon?
you're supposed to be with Olivia.
she's not supposed to be with the other one.
okay, Gabriel, let's go. - Not the other one.
come on. Back--back to bed. Let's go.
I need my shoes.
remember? Your shoes didn't fit. That's why your feet were bleeding.
but I liked those shoes. - I know. We'll get you some more shoes.
we will. Let's go.
Lloyd and Olivia sitting in a tree yeah, okay. I'll explain later.
let's go. - okay.
let's go, Gabriel. Inside.
Gabe, we're gonna do this. Come on. Let's go.
so good.
so good that you're together with Lloyd now.
no, we're not together.
you're together with Lloyd now. It's so good.
you know what? We're not-- we're not together, Gabe.
we're just--yeah, complicated. We're--we're...
you're the best thing since sliced bread. Yes?
okay.
you're--you're the best thing since sliced bread.
can I come in?
brought lunch.
Hi, Gabriel. - Where's the beef?
I got it right here.
go ahead.
so how's he doing?
uh, he's better.
good.
we got a lot of questions, and I'm gonna have to bring him into the FBI.
you know what? He hasn't finished his i.V. Antibiotics.
he needs a brain scan.
he's not going anywhere for a couple of days.
would it be all right if I just ask him a few questions here, then?
sure.
thank you.
Hey, buddy. Can I ask you a question?
I found this in your things.
you wanna tell me what this is?
my book. It's all there.
but what is this a picture of?
Gabriel, this is important.
I saw it.
I was there, on a trip.
I saw it.
a flash-forward.
Oh, no.
I don't like pickles!
okay, it's okay. - I don't like pickles!
I-I don't like lettuce!
I-I hate onions! I...
I like tomatoes.
I like--I like tomatoes.
now where are we?
starting from where we first pick up the Van Campos's sister was in-- 6th street bridge.
then we headed south.
we picked them up here, and then here, and then they head into this weird zone downtown.
eight blocks wide. Coverage their is sketchy, so we lost them.
you can't get me any more than that?
I'm not a magician.
any way we can pick up the van coming out of that zone?
well, there are over a hundred exits.
it'd take at least a day and a half to go through all that footage.
well, it's only eight blocks.
we can do a sweep in less time than whiz kid here.
you found something.
just following up on a tip.
I'm coming with you. - No, you're not.
Yes, I am. - No, you're not!
listen to me, Simon.
you're here for one reason and one reason only-- to work on the Q.E.D.
your volunteering here is starting to feel a little convenient.
I don't trust you, Simon. Not for a minute.
that's your prerogative.
you're damn right it is, and that's not gonna work out too well for you.
right now I'm gonna go get your sister back.
and after I do, you and I are gonna have a little sit-down.
no more lying.
they said want you and the ring.
they got your message, and they're sending one back.
you have 12 hours, or they'll kill me.
Annabelle. - Please, Simon.
give them what they want.
thanks for coming by.
I wanted to go over your latest serologies with you.
your tumor markers are undetectable.
lymphocytes are back to normal.
wait.
does that mean that I'm-- - experimental protocol seems to be working.
your cancer is officially in remission.
what? What? What?
we've been optimistic for a few weeks.
I just didn't want to get your hopes up.
I've had two other oncologists check those results, and it's working.
that's incredible.
well, what are you waiting for?
go on. Get out of here.
the future awaits.
Yeah.
you wanted to see me?
Yeah.
um, we have a shift down at immigration tonight giving flu shots to detainees.
can you help out?
sure. Happy to.
okay, great.
just take a look through these files and see what you're getting yourself into.
don't worry. It's all basic. Nothing you can't handle. Okay?
thank you.
have you been working all day?
since 5: 00 in the morning.
do you know this man?
someone tampered with his coffee.
Yeah. Andy.
you're sure? - Yeah, he's a regular.
he's here every day. So am I.
when's the last time you saw him?
uh, yesterday.
he was here with some guy, chatting away like they were old pals.
made a big deal about surviving something, his whole life to look forward to.
what' d his friend look like?
I don't know. Tall, kinda geeky-looking, wearing this big, ugly horseshoe ring.
life is energy, you see.
as each new life begins, another ends.
and if you mess with that balance, the universe...
you're sure? - Yeah, I am.
pushes back.
you can do what you will, but at any given moment of your life, you can will only one definite thing.
nothing other than that thing.
what do you guys think that means?
that free will is a lie?
exactly.
Where's Mr. Slingerland?
I don't know. He was here, and then he just left.
are you agent Noh?
he wanted me to tell you something.
what?
the universe always pushes back.
you might want to be careful.
we think someone's killing the people that lived past their death dates.
so you don't want me to go on television and announce it to the world?
I'm still here.
the universe seems to have a different plan for me.
he's trying to course-correct.
I think I know who he's going after next.
Celia Quinones, welcome to your future.
run! Celia, run! Run! Now!
Celia, now! Run!
south on grand! He's heading south on grand!
Freeze! FBI!
Oh, my God! Someone get help!
she just ran in front of me! I couldn't stop!
she's still alive. She's still alive.
E.M.T.S to grand and 6th priority 3! Code 1! Move!
she was just there, Demetri.
she's all right. Stay with her!
she's not dead. She's alive.
you failed.
not yet. Anyway...
it's not me.
it's the universe, which never fails.
it's funny.
I was supposed to have an aneurysm, but you killed me instead.
gets done either way.
see you soon...
here to make up for my bad behavior.
don't worry about it. You've been under a lot of stress lately.
I just wanted to say thanks.
for what?
cambridge, the brewschlagger fellowship, for getting me into N.L.A.P.
I did it for self reasons, Simon.
you make me look good.
gracious as well. You helped me out and you know it.
I wouldn't be anywhere without you.
okay, what's going on?
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about Annabelle.
truly, I am. I should've months ago.
it's been eating away at me, and I've been pretending I was fine.
I should have said something.
well, I'm--I'm sorry I couldn't help.
I would have, you know.
Yeah, I know you would.
you're the only real friend I have.
you are clearly in need of a drink. Come on.
Oh, you're not wrong, but I, uh...I have to be somewhere.
I'll see you, Lloyd.
I've been looking all over for you.
what's the matter?
I, um...I, uh...I have something I have to tell you.
me, too.
Okay...Then.
you're never gonna believe this.
my cancer is in remission. I know!
Oh, my God! Bryce, that's-- that's amazing!
I'm still completely in shock, and it--it got me thinking about my future, and I don't want to waste any more time.
are you sure? I mean, what we saw is
no, forget what we saw.
we're here, now.
this is all that matters.
what happened to Celia...There was nothing we could do.
you know, I've been thinking about our bird.
what if you tape the window?
how do you mean?
well, if you cover the window, the bird might not crash into it.
it's a nice thought.
but I think it'll probably just crash into a different window.
maybe.
but it's worth a shot.
it's the hospital calling.
Hello? - Agent Banks? Agent Fiona Banks?
Yes.
I'm calling about Celia Quinones and I'm afraid it's bad news.
her physical and neurological injuries are extensive, and I'm not optimistic about her chance of survival.
Oh, my God.
you're gonna call again on the 29th to tell me that she's gone.
ms. Banks, what happened to Celia was an accident.
there are no accidents anymore.
mark, we're running out of time for Campos's sister.
I've covered a 5-block radius. Only 3 to go.
I'm sorry. Special agent Benford FBI.
looks like they got you working late.
Yeah. Some clown ran right into this, nearly took out the electrical box.
pulled into that warehouse driving crazy.
that's a lot of damage.
imagine what the van looked like.
imagine.
I think I found the van.
put me through to S.W.A.T.
okay, move!
now go! Move.
it's okay.
you're safe now. I'm here.
yes?
it's mark.
we got her, Simon.
she's sitting right next to me.
thank god.
is she all right?
exhausted, confused, but physically she's fine.
can I talk to her for a second? I just wanna hear her voice.
all right, but then you and I need to talk, and you need to tell me everything.
no more lies, Simon.
fine.
he wants to talk to you.
is that really you?
I'm really tired, Simon.
I wanna go home and see mom.
I know.I just wanted to make sure you were safe.
no matter what happens, baby sister, remember...
I love you.
I love you, too.
good-bye, Belle.
Simon. - Good-bye, Mark.
he took the damn ring.
uh, what am I looking at?
so this is Gabriel Mcdow's brain.
no brain damage.
and he had hundreds of flash-forwards.
now these are taken from people who were being scanned at the time of the blackout on October 6th.
same thing. No damage. Nothing. Nothing unusual.
so you weren't lying about this in your interview.
Thanks.
makes me feel a bit better.
good.
well, so this Mcdow is a savant?
Yeah.
he's pretty high-functioning.
incredible memory.
and he thinks we should be together.
that's what he saw in his flash-forwards.
were we happy?
I know how I felt in mine.
I need to talk to you.
I was just leaving.
thanks for the scans, Olivia. I really appreciate it.
Yeah, sure. See you later. - Excuse me. Bye, Mark. I'll call you.
Simon Campos has disappeared.
what? - He's gone.
he came to see me tonight.
it was the strangest thing. It was like he was trying to say good-bye.
the day of the blackout-- anything about his behavior seem...Strange?
well, I don't know.
he was in Toronto at his father's funeral.
my dad died.
my god, Simon. What happened?
there was an accident.
I have to go home.
Yes, of course.
then we'll postpone until you get back.
no. Stick to the plan.
but the system's still on standby.
what difference does a week make? What's the rush?
no, we've worked too long, too hard at this.
we have to stay on schedule.
it has to be October 6th, 11: 00 a.m.
no delays.
you know, I never understood why he would miss that moment
I mean, after all those years of work, and we could've changed the date.
is Simon Campos capable of engineering a global blackout?
he's capable of anything.
and he always has a plan.
once we realized that his involvement in the blackout was deeper than we thought, I went back and I ran this gait analysis on Simon Campos and on Suspect Zero.
not only are they comparable in height, weight and age, they're a 99th percentile match in spacial-temporal and kinematic classes.
but Suspect Zero was in Detroit, and we have multiple eye witnesses that put Simon at his father's funeral in Toronto the same day.
I checked inbound flights to airports around Detroit.
on October 6th, a G4 with Canadian tail numbers requested an emergency maintenance landing at willow run.
so they wouldn't have filed a flight plan.
plane was on the ground for a couple of hours then right back to Toronto.
he could've gotten to the stadium then back to the airport by then.
show me that footage again.
Simon Campos is Suspect Zero.
if I showed you pictures, Annabelle, could you identify any of these guys?
we need to find the men who took you.
no.
I never saw any faces.
they always wore these weird masks.
please, can I go home now?
I know you're tired.
just one more question.
what did they want from Simon?
I told you. I don't know.
they just left me in the van.
they said they were done with me.
did you overhear anything? Anything at all?
what did they want him for?
I promise you. Nothing bad will happen to Simon.
think real hard.
in my flash-forward, I was in my office.
it was 10: 00 on the hour, and I happened to see the date...
april 29, 2010.
Oh, my God. This is it. We're here.
how's it going? - Struggling with the decoherence equation.
the equation? Yeah, you... you do the math.
you do the numbers together, and then you're both part of the equation - What's your name? - Keiko.
we have a shift down at immigration tonight.
I have something I have to tell you. - Yeah, me, too.
we're here now. This is all that matters.
I want to be a part of what's going on with this baby.
you don't have to do anything now.
what if I don't want to walk away?
I'm gonna be on this plane tomorrow. I'm hoping you will be, too.
we ran this gait analysis on Simon Campos and on Suspect Zero.
Simon Campos is Suspect Zero.
who's Hellinger? - Hellinger's our boss.
face down! On the floor!
Simon Campos... is he here?
no, Janis. I need your help.
mommy! Mommy!
Oh, sweetie!
it's okay. Deep breaths.
you're okay. You're okay.
what happened? - I had a bad dream.
you did? It's okay.
today's the day.
Oh. Yeah.
Yeah.
but you know what?
it's gonna be all right.
I'm right here.
today's the day daddy's gonna die.
you work with my security detail, so you know what will happen when everyone finds out that the mad scientist was awake when the rest of the world was asleep...
I'll be a dead man. - What do you want, Simon?
I want revenge.
I want to destroy the people who are really responsible for the global blackout.
look, they're cornered now.
we have Hellinger in custody.
you, of all people, must know it goes beyond one person.
I want to get back at them. - And who are they?
I don't know, and they had me install a piece of software into the mainframe to make the accelerator fire on October 6th.
we've been over that system a thousand times, and we didn't find anything.
well, I designed it. I'll find something other people won't.
let me bring you to the Bureau, Simon.
we can help you.
I can't do this with the FBI.
I can't do this with the CIA contacts.
those people won't let me anywhere near the mainframe again.
look...you get me into N. L.A. P.I'll turn myself in.
why did you start working for these people in the first place?
I was a kid...
told me I was destined for greatness.
I believed them.
8. 11AM
that was a marathon night, but we did it.
we got Hellinger. - Yeah, we did it.
it's not the end, though. Got a full morning with the digital forensics guys...
no, you don't. You got a flight to catch.
here.
what the hell is this?
that, my friend, is 15 covers of " Islands in the Stream.
there's My Morning Jacket, Feist, The Constantines, - some band from Croatia... - When the hell did you make this?
Yeah, I don't get much sleep.
dem, you're alive. In the future you saw, you weren't.
go to Hawaii. Go be alive. - Are you kidding, man? It's D-day.
we need all hands on deck. No.
the place is packed with CIA, FBI, NSA, we're covered.
mark. - Go. Pick a version you like.
dance with your bride.
what's up? - Nothing.
everyone gets cold feet, Dem.
it's not cold feet.
do you love her?
come on.
do you want to marry her?
hell, yes.
so what's stopping you?
you know, even with the way everything went down...
even though I lost her...
marrying Olivia was the best thing I ever did.
don't be afraid, especially on a day like this.
you'll stay home from school today with me, sweetie.
Hello? - Hey. It's me, Lloyd.
Hey, Lloyd. Can I call you back?
uh, no, there's no need. I was just, um,
I wanted to talk about tonight.
you know, I really can't think about that right now.
I... is everything okay?
Charlie's having a really hard time. - Well, yeah.
you know, I'd really like for us to be together.
you know, can I... I... I'll call you back, okay?
sweetie.
Where's Demetri?
he's taking care of something else. What do we got?
Hellinger invested big in Dot-Coms in the early '90s, then dumped them before the crash.
he put those earnings into real estate.
got out at the height of the market?
every transaction. He bought low, sold high.
Future-casting.
Yeah, listen, they use the flash-forwards to determine the outcome of a particular event, then put money on a sure thing.
so was this the bigger conspiracy you were talking about in Hong Kong?
because it sounds like econ 101.
imagine how you could use this technology.
to manipulate geopolitics.
NSA just finished up with Hellinger.
it's been eight hours, and he just said his first six words...
I'm only speaking to Mark Benford.
finally.
we need to talk.
did you cause the global blackout?
we actually have something more pressing that has to do with you.
did you cause the global blackout?
Yes, I caused the blackout.
but that really doesn't matter now. We can't change that.
how'd you do it?
I've seen today more times than I can remember.
and a lot of those days started with me sitting right here with you.
may I?
this? - Please.
thank you.
there are so many possibilities...
different paths this day could take.
I have seen so many different versions of this moment...
and the next one and the next one.
but in every version of the future I saw...
I saw this.
in this room, you will lose control.
and then you'll lose everything.
you're going to attack me, Mark.
you're going to attack me because you realize you will never get the answers to your questions.
and then at the end of it all, you'll be killed in your office.
when's the next blackout?
I've seen how this goes, Mark.
if you keep me in custody, you will die.
I'm sorry. You drew me a picture, and now you want me to let you go?
I know it seems self-serving, but please, you have to believe me.
this... this is your life.
tell me how you did it and how to stop it from happening again.
if you're not interested in saving your own life,
I don't have much to say to you, agent Benford.
that's all right. You just told me what your next move is.
mind if I take this?
0. 381944444444444
you know we're kicking civilians out at noon, right?
Yeah, I was just packing up my stuff so I could carry on working at home.
I'm sorry. Can I help you with something? - That symbol. What is it?
the tachyon constant.
it's a theoretical number that physicists have been trying to crack for centuries, sort of a holy grail thing.
it was on these blueprints that Dyson frost was carrying.
it was in the formula in my flash-forward.
well, at 10: 00 tonight, I'm supposed to be on the verge of cracking something monumental.
that would certainly qualify.
I don't know if this will help or not, but there it is again.
Lucas Hellinger drew this.
he included that symbol as something his side is gonna do today.
I want to beat him to the punch.
so what the hell is a tachyon wipe?
nothing. Doesn't make any sense.
the tachyon's a particle. You can't wipe it.
you literally can't even touch it.
hey happy flash-forward day.
I know you love these. They're for you.
Thanks. I was just thinking about you.
liar.
um, seriously. Check it out.
so I haven't planned out everything for tonight, but I thought maybe we could start with some water polo.
uh, we could Bbob for apples, maybe finish off with some scuba diving.
Yeah. Keiko.
are you sure that you're okay with tonight...
with us?
so the sweet, sexy woman that brings me cupcakes...
worried about a pretend girl who lives half a world away?
come on.
Keiko-San...
attention, travelers.
you are not required to give money to solicitors.
the airport does not sponsor their activities.
Oh, baby.
I knew you'd come. Oh, my God.
so my parents are already at the hotel, and they said that there's a hot tub in the room.
do you remember the last time we had a hot tub in the room?
Yeah.
you ready?
can I talk to you for a minute? - Yeah.
okay.
what's up?
I love you.
and, uh, I should have told you this...
a long time ago.
in Janis' vision, she was... pregnant.
for that to come true, it had to happen while she was in Somalia.
okay.
I slept with Janis so she could get pregnant.
what? - I know that was wrong.
I just... the future was happening, you know?
my life was ending. Another life was beginning.
I know it sounds crazy, but...
I thought I was gonna die, and...
it made sense at the time.
W...
EV... everything that I've been doing, Dem...
all the... all the lines that I've crossed, the... I did everything for you. I did everything I could.
I... it was because I... I believed that...
I believed that you were gonna live and that we were gonna spend the rest of our lives together.
obviously, you didn't.
I am so sorry.
so sorry.
I just thought that our life together was over on March 15th.
that's what I thought. I was wrong.
you were right. You believed that we can change the future.
but I want to start over.
I want to marry you. Please marry me.
please?
um...
I'm gonna, uh...
I'm gonna go to Hawaii with my parents, and I don't want you to come, Dem.
and, uh, after that...
I don't know.
don't worry, Tracy. We made it.
this is where we were in our flash-forward.
I was in a cave.
Jericho brought me here.
honey, don't worry. Don't try to talk.
she needs a hospital. - I'm not sure I can care for her here.
her pulse is thready. - They made me tell them.
Tracy, we know what we saw. You're gonna be fine, all right?
I cross-referenced Hellinger's financial documents with the word "Tachyon.
tachyon offsite information systems.
their office is in Arcadia.
do you think that's what Hellinger meant by a tachyon wipe?
they warehouse data.
maybe you can't wipe a tachyon, but data's a whole other story.
I'm going in with a team. - Whoa, Mark.
you sure that's a good idea? - Going after the bad guys? Yeah.
think about it. Hellinger helps organize a worldwide blackout.
you really believe he'd be sloppy enough to leave you a clue like this?
maybe.
people make mistakes. - Forget it.
what? - You heard me.
you're staying. You stay on Hellinger.
I'll send a special ops unit to check it out.
no. No, no, no. No, no. You can't do that.
I can. You're staying. I'm not letting you walk into a trap.
she's barely moving air.
Tracy, breathe! Tracy! - Please! No, no, no, stop.
aaron, please, let me work. Please.
you.
what the hell did you and your Jericho buddies do to her?
you're gonna tell me why Jericho came after my daughter.
I'm just an independent contractor on a security...
she saw you guys killing an entire village.
I don't know what you're talking about.
you're gonna tell me why now.
we weren't killing them.
she saw an entire village full of people passed out on the ground.
it was an experiment...
a test run.
for what?
keep talking!
the experiment's radius was 1 kilometer.
we needed to know why she was awake.
experiment for what?
for what? - For the global blackout.
I hope the CIA gives you an expense account.
we're gonna have to stop by a hardware store, pick up some supplies on the way to N. L.A. P.
breaking into a linear accelerator...
I think we're gonna need a little more than duct tape.
not that kind of hardware.
what's going on with you, Janis? What the hell is he doing here?
tell him to put down his weapon.
what's he doing here, Janis?!
he's making a deal.
0. 565277777777778
you're bringing him to N. L.A. P?
you're planning to let him touch that accelerator?
he can give us more information than anyone else can.
in the meantime, you risk him using that machine to put the world to sleep again.
Hey, I didn't use it the first time. I'm not gonna use it this time, either.
this is about nailing the people behind the blackout.
this is about getting the job done the best way I know how.
Janis, come on.
you got more to worry about than just doing a good job.
okay, Dem.
I just need you to pretend like you never came by.
just let me do this.
no.
you're gonna regret this decision for the rest of your life.
we've secured the tachyon data center.
all we've got is a room full of servers.
has the data been wiped?
no. It's weird. I'm getting nothing...just a blinking cursor.
what the hell was that?
I don't know. It sounded like it was coming from a storeroom.
I thought you swept the place.
we did. I'm gonna go check it out.
we're getting thermal readings back now.
no. Get out of there. Get out of there, agent!
Whoa! Heads up! Movement on your...
watch out... 9: 00!
get out of there!
mark, wait.
what's going on?
they opened fire on three of our guys.
you were right. Tachyon was a trap.
whoa. Cool down.
no, I gotta go talk to him! - Cool... cool down.
don't worry.
I got this. I got this.
daddy!
Oh, hey, sweetie.
you okay? - Yeah.
Hey, Stan.
are you?
Yeah.
it's been a slow day.
babe, you want to go wait in daddy's office?
look, I'm really sorry just to bring her here like this.
I think the reality of today and, you know, everything that's happened... I think it's really hitting her.
she just needed her dad.
I... I really did not know what else to do.
I'm glad you brought her over.
Hey, Charlie bear.
what's up?
I don't want you to die.
come here.
I need to ask you to do something for me, something really, really hard.
don't be afraid.
I mean, it's okay to be afraid. It is.
but that's just what happens at first.
after that, you have to tell yourself something...
my daddy loves me, and everything will be okay, no matter what.
my daddy loves me.
so much.
and everything will be okay, no matter what.
it's not easy,'cause things can be scary, bigger than us.
but we can fight it.
that's what I do.
I tell myself, "Charlie loves me,"and everything will be okay no matter what.
you do? - I do.
I tell myself that, and it makes me strong.
it makes me brave.
cause when I say that...
you're always with me.
and when I say it?
I'm always with you.
always.
I love you so much, baby girl.
I love you with everything I've got.
Oh. Thanks, honey.
Hey. You go and be with mom, ok? You go ahead now.
you're making a big mistake. - Shut up.
Janis, this guy has been lying to us about everything.
he was working for them. He was awake during the blackout.
how the ll do you trust this guy?
after all the lying,
I think I've realized that you just get to a point where you can't do it anymore.
you coming with me?
to the FBI? - Yeah.
no. Tell 'em where you found him.
don't lie for me.
this N. L.A. P. thing is totally insane.
you know that, right? - Yeah. I know that.
if I hadn't have shown up, you would have gone through with this?
Yeah.
get in.
no, Dylan. Dylan, watch out.
I am watching.
no, it's a figure of speech. I mean, be careful, 'cause somewhere in here is the answer - to a very big question. - Why did the 8 die?
what?
why did the 8 die?
Oh, no, no. That's, um, that's not an 8. That's infinity.
what's infinity?
uh, well, infinity means "forever.
but you're right, it does kind of look like an 8 on its side.
all the ones with numbers have to be together.
no, Dylan. Just please, please leave those there.
it all has to be in the right place.
what did you say?
it all has to be in the right place.
do the numbers. You do the numbers together, and then you're both part of the equation.
okay, Dylan, Dylan, Dylan.
go and get your coat. Go now. Go, go, go.
I hope your agents are all right.
in most futures, they survive.
when's the next blackout?
I don't know if you're in a place where you can hear this right now, and I don't want to say I told you so, but I gave you a choice, Mark.
I asked you a question. When is the next blackout?
I gave you a choice, and you chose the wrong path.
I'm sorry the way this is turning out.
I mean it when I say that.
but there is nothing you can do to turn this back around.
shut up! When is it?
you're going to die, Mark, and I take no pleasure in that.
I really don't. I've had so many conversations with you in this very room. You're a decent man.
this is just all over your head.
when is the next blackout?
mark, you work hard.
you're passionate about what you do.
but don't you see? All of this is just so futile, - All of it? - All of it.
we caught you.
your faith... it's admirable.
I mean, that board in your office...
how much time have you spent on that thing?
how much time have you spent just looking at it, all on faith?
but deep down, you've gotta know what that board really is...
tell me. What is that board about?
it's nothing but a scrapbook of your failures.
tell me when the next blackout is.
a freed Nazi, a... a botched mission to Somalia, some monster paintings, - dead birds... - Tell me.
and you keep looking at it. You keep believing, and you keep fighting 'cause that's what you do.
you and that board, you're Mr. stick-to-it. Don't you see?
that's why you're gonna die, Mark.
you just don't give up. You just...
Oh, I swear to God, Mark,
I am gonna miss you.
Charlie's gonna miss you, too.
you are gonna die, Mark.
you're gonna die, but there is an upside.
and this is gonna sound a lot harsher than it really is.
deep down, you know what I mean.
you're going to die.
but your daughter's going to be better off when you're gone.
I'm not finished!
Aah! Let go of me!
clean yourself up, playboy.
get him the hell out of here.
you gotta be kidding me.
you've been on the brink of losing control all day...
all year.
that crazy son of a bitch...
out, now. I don't care what day it is.
no, Stan... - Get him out of here. Get out.
you can't do this to me! You're not gonna do this!
0. 678472222222222
we are gonna have so much fun tonight. I promise.
I was just really looking forward to a picnic.
that's what we're doing. We gotta get there early and stake out some good seats for the fireworks.
just, there's gonna be 2, 000 other people.
I wanted to be with you.
Hey. There's never been a night like tonight.
I mean, in four hours, people are literally gonna be deciding whether to make their own futures happen.
I want to be witness to that.
Why? 'Cause your future didn't happen?
Oh. Where'd that come from?
I've just been thinking a lot about the visions lately, and I'm... I'm worried mine may have already started.
you'll be with me.
nothing is gonna happen no, to you tonight. Not. I promise.
come on. Let's go.
you know, it's not the drowning.
it's that feeling I had, you know, like I deserved it.
I've been keeping a secret from you.
it's really stupid now, because when I tell you, you're gonna hate me.
come on. Give me some credit.
Keiko. She's in Los Angeles.
what?
I'm sorry. I should have told you as soon as I found out.
but I just...I was afraid you'd choose her.
no, just... just tell me where she is.
some people from the hospital...
they went down to this immigration detention center in Lancaster.
she's in... in jail?
no, it's... it's just a holding facility.
you let her stay in... in jail?
I should have told you, Bryce. I'm sorry.
there's someone here to see you.
Keiko! Okasan.
it's i can't shh.
don't you'll your when eleven we have just at what so i you and they
her heart has stopped! I need your help! Come on.
Tracy! Trace, no!
just breathe. Breathe, Tracy. Trace!
Tracy! Oh, no.
come on, sweetheart. Come on, sweetheart.
come on! This can be right. Tracy, come on back!
come back to me, sweetheart. Come back to me.
0. 776388888888889
this is just all over your head.
you have no idea.
in every version of the future I saw, I saw this.
the forces of the universe are maybe pushing us towards the futures we have seen. You are gonna die, Mark.
but there is an upside.
deep down, you know what I mean.
your daughter's gonna be better off when you're gone.
uh, excuse me.
Hey, look, I don't mean to bother you, but, uh, in my vision, I had just quit drinking.
and I, um, and I'd really like to make that happen right now.
see, I... I saw you, and you...
you look like you can use this.
here.
no. It's okay. I don't...
0. 781944444444444
what made you change your mind?
I don't know.
I mean, I get why you did it. It worked. We have Hellinger.
but, Janis, I was so pissed off at you.
working for the CIA?
since Quantico, I...
I felt like I lost my best friend.
it's like I didn't know who the hell you were.
you know, and then I'm driving away.
I got Campos in the backseat. I'm looking in the rearview, and I'm thinking, going to N. L. A.P? This is...
it's so like you. I know you, Janis.
I mean, I don't know what you were doing.
I don't know what the hell we're doing tonight, but I... I do know you.
I told Zoey...
about the baby. - What?
you know, there just comes a time when you...
you can't lie anymore, right?
aaron, we need to stop now.
she's gonna be okay!
her brain has been deprived of oxygen too long.
I know what I saw!
she's been through enough.
we were here together.
her heart has stopped beating.
she's gone. Aaron.
let her go.
I saw you, Tracy.
Tracy. I saw you.
downtown Los Angeles has swelled as thousands begin to party as what has been seen as more reminiscent of a new year's celebration rather than what was promised as a disaster.
I like the string, buddy.
the Chinese say red string brings luck.
the Dutch say leave me alone.
well, maybe in my vision, you and I were talking to each other. You ever think about that?
Nope.
because that's not what I remember.
Lloyd? Hey, I'm sorry. I meant to call.
I'm at your house. Why haven't you been answering your phone?
uh, I just needed to get away.
when are you coming back? - Uh, not for a while.
what are you talking about?
I just need some space, Lloyd. I need to get away from you and Mark and flash-forwards and all of it.
I just... I need to get away. - No, Olivia. Olivia, listen to me.
look, certain conditions have to be met if I...
at 10: 00 p. m.you have to be here with me.
don't do this. Don't make this about fate.
don't make this about freewill, okay?
I have Charlie to think about.
so I am not gonna be in that house with you tonight.
I'm sorry.
they're not coming back.
no.
Yeah, no, I'm sure it was you.
cheap suit and the...
the bad breath and the droopy eyes.
and I kept saying, hey, man, why are the eyes so droopy?
that's it?
is that the best you can do?
so you're one of those guys.
am I? - Yeah.
you're fightin' fate, and it's so sad, man.
cause it's so obvious, man, you've already lost.
in my flash-forward, I was in my office.
it was 10: 00 on the hour, and I happened to see the date...
april 29, 2010.
Oh, my God. This is it. We're here.
how's it going? - Struggling with the decoherence equation.
the equation? Yeah, you... you do the math.
you do the numbers together, and then you're both part of the equation - What's your name? - Keiko.
we have a shift down at immigration tonight.
I have something I have to tell you. - Yeah, me, too.
we're here now. This is all that matters.
I want to be a part of what's going on with this baby.
you don't have to do anything now.
what if I don't want to walk away?
I'm gonna be on this plane tomorrow. I'm hoping you will be, too.
we ran this gait analysis on Simon Campos and on Suspect Zero.
Simon Campos is Suspect Zero.
who's Hellinger? - Hellinger's our boss.
face down! On the floor!
Simon Campos... is he here?
no, Janis. I need your help.
mommy! Mommy!
Oh, sweetie!
it's okay. Deep breaths.
you're okay. You're okay.
what happened? - I had a bad dream.
you did? It's okay.
today's the day.
Oh. Yeah.
Yeah.
but you know what?
it's gonna be all right.
I'm right here.
today's the day daddy's gonna die.
you work with my security detail, so you know what will happen when everyone finds out that the mad scientist was awake when the rest of the world was asleep...
I'll be a dead man. - What do you want, Simon?
I want revenge.
I want to destroy the people who are really responsible for the global blackout.
look, they're cornered now.
we have Hellinger in custody.
you, of all people, must know it goes beyond one person.
I want to get back at them. - And who are they?
I don't know, and they had me install a piece of software into the mainframe to make the accelerator fire on October 6th.
we've been over that system a thousand times, and we didn't find anything.
well, I designed it. I'll find something other people won't.
let me bring you to the Bureau, Simon.
we can help you.
I can't do this with the FBI.
I can't do this with the CIA contacts.
those people won't let me anywhere near the mainframe again.
look...you get me into N. L.A. P.I'll turn myself in.
why did you start working for these people in the first place?
I was a kid...
told me I was destined for greatness.
I believed them.
8. 11AM
that was a marathon night, but we did it.
we got Hellinger. - Yeah, we did it.
it's not the end, though. Got a full morning with the digital forensics guys...
no, you don't. You got a flight to catch.
here.
what the hell is this?
that, my friend, is 15 covers of " Islands in the Stream.
there's My Morning Jacket, Feist, The Constantines, - some band from Croatia... - When the hell did you make this?
Yeah, I don't get much sleep.
dem, you're alive. In the future you saw, you weren't.
go to Hawaii. Go be alive. - Are you kidding, man? It's D-day.
we need all hands on deck. No.
the place is packed with CIA, FBI, NSA, we're covered.
mark. - Go. Pick a version you like.
dance with your bride.
what's up? - Nothing.
everyone gets cold feet, Dem.
it's not cold feet.
do you love her?
come on.
do you want to marry her?
hell, yes.
so what's stopping you?
you know, even with the way everything went down...
even though I lost her...
marrying Olivia was the best thing I ever did.
don't be afraid, especially on a day like this.
you'll stay home from school today with me, sweetie.
Hello? - Hey. It's me, Lloyd.
Hey, Lloyd. Can I call you back?
uh, no, there's no need. I was just, um,
I wanted to talk about tonight.
you know, I really can't think about that right now.
I... is everything okay?
Charlie's having a really hard time. - Well, yeah.
you know, I'd really like for us to be together.
you know, can I... I... I'll call you back, okay?
sweetie.
Where's Demetri?
he's taking care of something else. What do we got?
Hellinger invested big in Dot-Coms in the early '90s, then dumped them before the crash.
he put those earnings into real estate.
got out at the height of the market?
every transaction. He bought low, sold high.
Future-casting.
Yeah, listen, they use the flash-forwards to determine the outcome of a particular event, then put money on a sure thing.
so was this the bigger conspiracy you were talking about in Hong Kong?
because it sounds like econ 101.
imagine how you could use this technology.
to manipulate geopolitics.
NSA just finished up with Hellinger.
it's been eight hours, and he just said his first six words...
I'm only speaking to Mark Benford.
finally.
we need to talk.
did you cause the global blackout?
we actually have something more pressing that has to do with you.
did you cause the global blackout?
Yes, I caused the blackout.
but that really doesn't matter now. We can't change that.
how'd you do it?
I've seen today more times than I can remember.
and a lot of those days started with me sitting right here with you.
may I?
this? - Please.
thank you.
there are so many possibilities...
different paths this day could take.
I have seen so many different versions of this moment...
and the next one and the next one.
but in every version of the future I saw...
I saw this.
in this room, you will lose control.
and then you'll lose everything.
you're going to attack me, Mark.
you're going to attack me because you realize you will never get the answers to your questions.
and then at the end of it all, you'll be killed in your office.
when's the next blackout?
I've seen how this goes, Mark.
if you keep me in custody, you will die.
I'm sorry. You drew me a picture, and now you want me to let you go?
I know it seems self-serving, but please, you have to believe me.
this... this is your life.
tell me how you did it and how to stop it from happening again.
if you're not interested in saving your own life,
I don't have much to say to you, agent Benford.
that's all right. You just told me what your next move is.
mind if I take this?
0. 381944444444444
you know we're kicking civilians out at noon, right?
Yeah, I was just packing up my stuff so I could carry on working at home.
I'm sorry. Can I help you with something? - That symbol. What is it?
the tachyon constant.
it's a theoretical number that physicists have been trying to crack for centuries, sort of a holy grail thing.
it was on these blueprints that Dyson frost was carrying.
it was in the formula in my flash-forward.
well, at 10: 00 tonight, I'm supposed to be on the verge of cracking something monumental.
that would certainly qualify.
I don't know if this will help or not, but there it is again.
Lucas Hellinger drew this.
he included that symbol as something his side is gonna do today.
I want to beat him to the punch.
so what the hell is a tachyon wipe?
nothing. Doesn't make any sense.
the tachyon's a particle. You can't wipe it.
you literally can't even touch it.
hey happy flash-forward day.
I know you love these. They're for you.
Thanks. I was just thinking about you.
liar.
um, seriously. Check it out.
so I haven't planned out everything for tonight, but I thought maybe we could start with some water polo.
uh, we could Bbob for apples, maybe finish off with some scuba diving.
Yeah. Keiko.
are you sure that you're okay with tonight...
with us?
so the sweet, sexy woman that brings me cupcakes...
worried about a pretend girl who lives half a world away?
come on.
Keiko-San...
attention, travelers.
you are not required to give money to solicitors.
the airport does not sponsor their activities.
Oh, baby.
I knew you'd come. Oh, my God.
so my parents are already at the hotel, and they said that there's a hot tub in the room.
do you remember the last time we had a hot tub in the room?
Yeah.
you ready?
can I talk to you for a minute? - Yeah.
okay.
what's up?
I love you.
and, uh, I should have told you this...
a long time ago.
in Janis' vision, she was... pregnant.
for that to come true, it had to happen while she was in Somalia.
okay.
I slept with Janis so she could get pregnant.
what? - I know that was wrong.
I just... the future was happening, you know?
my life was ending. Another life was beginning.
I know it sounds crazy, but...
I thought I was gonna die, and...
it made sense at the time.
W...
EV... everything that I've been doing, Dem...
all the... all the lines that I've crossed, the... I did everything for you. I did everything I could.
I... it was because I... I believed that...
I believed that you were gonna live and that we were gonna spend the rest of our lives together.
obviously, you didn't.
I am so sorry.
so sorry.
I just thought that our life together was over on March 15th.
that's what I thought. I was wrong.
you were right. You believed that we can change the future.
but I want to start over.
I want to marry you. Please marry me.
please?
um...
I'm gonna, uh...
I'm gonna go to Hawaii with my parents, and I don't want you to come, Dem.
and, uh, after that...
I don't know.
don't worry, Tracy. We made it.
this is where we were in our flash-forward.
I was in a cave.
Jericho brought me here.
honey, don't worry. Don't try to talk.
she needs a hospital. - I'm not sure I can care for her here.
her pulse is thready. - They made me tell them.
Tracy, we know what we saw. You're gonna be fine, all right?
I cross-referenced Hellinger's financial documents with the word "Tachyon.
tachyon offsite information systems.
their office is in Arcadia.
do you think that's what Hellinger meant by a tachyon wipe?
they warehouse data.
maybe you can't wipe a tachyon, but data's a whole other story.
I'm going in with a team. - Whoa, Mark.
you sure that's a good idea? - Going after the bad guys? Yeah.
think about it. Hellinger helps organize a worldwide blackout.
you really believe he'd be sloppy enough to leave you a clue like this?
maybe.
people make mistakes. - Forget it.
what? - You heard me.
you're staying. You stay on Hellinger.
I'll send a special ops unit to check it out.
no. No, no, no. No, no. You can't do that.
I can. You're staying. I'm not letting you walk into a trap.
she's barely moving air.
Tracy, breathe! Tracy! - Please! No, no, no, stop.
aaron, please, let me work. Please.
you.
what the hell did you and your Jericho buddies do to her?
you're gonna tell me why Jericho came after my daughter.
I'm just an independent contractor on a security...
she saw you guys killing an entire village.
I don't know what you're talking about.
you're gonna tell me why now.
we weren't killing them.
she saw an entire village full of people passed out on the ground.
it was an experiment...
a test run.
for what?
keep talking!
the experiment's radius was 1 kilometer.
we needed to know why she was awake.
experiment for what?
for what? - For the global blackout.
I hope the CIA gives you an expense account.
we're gonna have to stop by a hardware store, pick up some supplies on the way to N. L.A. P.
breaking into a linear accelerator...
I think we're gonna need a little more than duct tape.
not that kind of hardware.
what's going on with you, Janis? What the hell is he doing here?
tell him to put down his weapon.
what's he doing here, Janis?!
he's making a deal.
0. 565277777777778
you're bringing him to N. L.A. P?
you're planning to let him touch that accelerator?
he can give us more information than anyone else can.
in the meantime, you risk him using that machine to put the world to sleep again.
Hey, I didn't use it the first time. I'm not gonna use it this time, either.
this is about nailing the people behind the blackout.
this is about getting the job done the best way I know how.
Janis, come on.
you got more to worry about than just doing a good job.
okay, Dem.
I just need you to pretend like you never came by.
just let me do this.
no.
you're gonna regret this decision for the rest of your life.
we've secured the tachyon data center.
all we've got is a room full of servers.
has the data been wiped?
no. It's weird. I'm getting nothing...just a blinking cursor.
what the hell was that?
I don't know. It sounded like it was coming from a storeroom.
I thought you swept the place.
we did. I'm gonna go check it out.
we're getting thermal readings back now.
no. Get out of there. Get out of there, agent!
Whoa! Heads up! Movement on your...
watch out... 9: 00!
get out of there!
mark, wait.
what's going on?
they opened fire on three of our guys.
you were right. Tachyon was a trap.
whoa. Cool down.
no, I gotta go talk to him! - Cool... cool down.
don't worry.
I got this. I got this.
daddy!
Oh, hey, sweetie.
you okay? - Yeah.
Hey, Stan.
are you?
Yeah.
it's been a slow day.
babe, you want to go wait in daddy's office?
look, I'm really sorry just to bring her here like this.
I think the reality of today and, you know, everything that's happened... I think it's really hitting her.
she just needed her dad.
I... I really did not know what else to do.
I'm glad you brought her over.
Hey, Charlie bear.
what's up?
I don't want you to die.
come here.
I need to ask you to do something for me, something really, really hard.
don't be afraid.
I mean, it's okay to be afraid. It is.
but that's just what happens at first.
after that, you have to tell yourself something...
my daddy loves me, and everything will be okay, no matter what.
my daddy loves me.
so much.
and everything will be okay, no matter what.
it's not easy,'cause things can be scary, bigger than us.
but we can fight it.
that's what I do.
I tell myself, "Charlie loves me,"and everything will be okay no matter what.
you do? - I do.
I tell myself that, and it makes me strong.
it makes me brave.
cause when I say that...
you're always with me.
and when I say it?
I'm always with you.
always.
I love you so much, baby girl.
I love you with everything I've got.
Oh. Thanks, honey.
Hey. You go and be with mom, ok? You go ahead now.
you're making a big mistake. - Shut up.
Janis, this guy has been lying to us about everything.
he was working for them. He was awake during the blackout.
how the ll do you trust this guy?
after all the lying,
I think I've realized that you just get to a point where you can't do it anymore.
you coming with me?
to the FBI? - Yeah.
no. Tell 'em where you found him.
don't lie for me.
this N. L.A. P. thing is totally insane.
you know that, right? - Yeah. I know that.
if I hadn't have shown up, you would have gone through with this?
Yeah.
get in.
no, Dylan. Dylan, watch out.
I am watching.
no, it's a figure of speech. I mean, be careful, 'cause somewhere in here is the answer - to a very big question. - Why did the 8 die?
what?
why did the 8 die?
Oh, no, no. That's, um, that's not an 8. That's infinity.
what's infinity?
uh, well, infinity means "forever.
but you're right, it does kind of look like an 8 on its side.
all the ones with numbers have to be together.
no, Dylan. Just please, please leave those there.
it all has to be in the right place.
what did you say?
it all has to be in the right place.
do the numbers. You do the numbers together, and then you're both part of the equation.
okay, Dylan, Dylan, Dylan.
go and get your coat. Go now. Go, go, go.
I hope your agents are all right.
in most futures, they survive.
when's the next blackout?
I don't know if you're in a place where you can hear this right now, and I don't want to say I told you so, but I gave you a choice, Mark.
I asked you a question. When is the next blackout?
I gave you a choice, and you chose the wrong path.
I'm sorry the way this is turning out.
I mean it when I say that.
but there is nothing you can do to turn this back around.
shut up! When is it?
you're going to die, Mark, and I take no pleasure in that.
I really don't. I've had so many conversations with you in this very room. You're a decent man.
this is just all over your head.
when is the next blackout?
mark, you work hard.
you're passionate about what you do.
but don't you see? All of this is just so futile, - All of it? - All of it.
we caught you.
your faith... it's admirable.
I mean, that board in your office...
how much time have you spent on that thing?
how much time have you spent just looking at it, all on faith?
but deep down, you've gotta know what that board really is...
tell me. What is that board about?
it's nothing but a scrapbook of your failures.
tell me when the next blackout is.
a freed Nazi, a... a botched mission to Somalia, some monster paintings, - dead birds... - Tell me.
and you keep looking at it. You keep believing, and you keep fighting 'cause that's what you do.
you and that board, you're Mr. stick-to-it. Don't you see?
that's why you're gonna die, Mark.
you just don't give up. You just...
Oh, I swear to God, Mark,
I am gonna miss you.
Charlie's gonna miss you, too.
you are gonna die, Mark.
you're gonna die, but there is an upside.
and this is gonna sound a lot harsher than it really is.
deep down, you know what I mean.
you're going to die.
but your daughter's going to be better off when you're gone.
I'm not finished!
Aah! Let go of me!
clean yourself up, playboy.
get him the hell out of here.
you gotta be kidding me.
you've been on the brink of losing control all day...
all year.
that crazy son of a bitch...
out, now. I don't care what day it is.
no, Stan... - Get him out of here. Get out.
you can't do this to me! You're not gonna do this!
0. 678472222222222
we are gonna have so much fun tonight. I promise.
I was just really looking forward to a picnic.
that's what we're doing. We gotta get there early and stake out some good seats for the fireworks.
just, there's gonna be 2, 000 other people.
I wanted to be with you.
Hey. There's never been a night like tonight.
I mean, in four hours, people are literally gonna be deciding whether to make their own futures happen.
I want to be witness to that.
Why? 'Cause your future didn't happen?
Oh. Where'd that come from?
I've just been thinking a lot about the visions lately, and I'm... I'm worried mine may have already started.
you'll be with me.
nothing is gonna happen no, to you tonight. Not. I promise.
come on. Let's go.
you know, it's not the drowning.

this is just all over your head.
you have no idea.
in every version of the future I saw, I saw this.
the forces of the universe are maybe pushing us towards the futures we have seen. You are gonna die, Mark.
but there is an upside.
deep down, you know what I mean.
your daughter's gonna be better off when you're gone.
uh, excuse me.
Hey, look, I don't mean to bother you, but, uh, in my vision, I had just quit drinking.

what made you change your mind?
I don't know.
I mean, I get why you did it. It worked. We have Hellinger.
but, Janis, I was so pissed off at you.
working for the CIA?
since Quantico, I...
I felt like I lost my best friend.
it's like I didn't know who the hell you were.
you know, and then I'm driving away.
I got Campos in the backseat. I'm looking in the rearview, and I'm thinking, going to N. L. A.P? This is...
it's so like you. I know you, Janis.
I mean, I don't know what you were doing.
I don't know what the hell we're doing tonight, but I... I do know you.
I told Zoey...
about the baby. - What?
you know, there just comes a time when you...
you can't lie anymore, right?
aaron, we need to stop now.

her brain has been deprived of oxygen too long.
I know what I saw!
she's been through enough.
we were here together.
her heart has stopped beating.
she's gone. Aaron.
let her go.
I saw you, Tracy.
Tracy. I saw you.
downtown Los Angeles has swelled as thousands begin to party as what has been seen as more reminiscent of a new year's celebration rather than what was promised as a disaster.
I like the string, buddy.
the Chinese say red string brings luck.
the Dutch say leave me alone.
well, maybe in my vision, you and I were talking to each other. You ever think about that?
Nope.
because that's not what I remember.
Lloyd? Hey, I'm sorry. I meant to call.
I'm at your house. Why haven't you been answering your phone?
uh, I just needed to get away.
when are you coming back? - Uh, not for a while.
what are you talking about?
I just need some space, Lloyd. I need to get away from you and Mark and flash-forwards and all of it.
I just... I need to get away. - No, Olivia. Olivia, listen to me.
look, certain conditions have to be met if I...
at 10: 00 p. m.you have to be here with me.
don't do this. Don't make this about fate.
don't make this about freewill, okay?
I have Charlie to think about.
so I am not gonna be in that house with you tonight.
I'm sorry.
they're not coming back.
no.
Yeah, no, I'm sure it was you.
cheap suit and the...
the bad breath and the droopy eyes.
and I kept saying, hey, man, why are the eyes so droopy?
that's it?
is that the best you can do?
so you're one of those guys.
am I? - Yeah.
you're fightin' fate, and it's so sad, man.
cause it's so obvious, man, you've already lost.
what's happening, man? I can't see you.
I'm working on it.
don't play with me, man.
Justin: Look, what do you want?
I am going as fast as I can, so let me do this!
you tickle me, I will leave you.
what makes you think I'd do something like that?
Hey, listen. I have a idea.
how about we switch, okay?
I want three naps, nine hot meals, bubble baths and back massages every day while you go out and slave on double shifts.
Hey, I'm working my butt off here.
yeah?
how you feeling?
like a punching bag.
feel that?
Yes.
listen, I have a surprise for you.
gee. My cell phone.
Yes, except now it has a direct link to this one, which I'm gonna put in the nursery.
free baby monitor.
is that legal? - Yeah... yeah.
I just... I-I gave the phone a dynamic ip, right?
and then I set up our home system to work as a remote C...
Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Oh, you don't care, okay.
thank you.
have I ever told you how much I love you?
no, I don't think so.
well, you're gonna have to remind me to get around to that someday.
who is it?
Hey, mike. What's going on?
Mike: Jus, I need to talk to you. It's serious.
it's actually a really bad time right now, mike.
I'm headed to work. I've got an afternoon shift.

Ooh, make a muscle.
Oh, that's nice!

uh, no. It's okay. I'll do it.
$20, 000? - I can put something together.
I can sell some stuff. It wouldn't be an issue.
Mike, there's no way.
I don't have that kind of money.
I know, I know, I know.
I just figured, you know, you work at the bank, maybe you could transfer some money.
maybe I could what, mike?
what do you think could do? I'm a button pusher.
I don't authorize loans to gambling addicts.
Yeah, well, then maybe you can push the right buttons.
Oh, I don't believe this.
it's temporary, jus.
it's gonna take a couple of days.
you know, we don't hear from you in six months, and we think, you know, thank god, he's finally got his act together.
I ow. I know. I know.
I wouldn't be coming to you unless I was desperate, okay?
who are these guys, mike?
I don't know. I don't know.
they just showed up.
I've never seen them before.
all of a sudden, the ten grand that I owe is now 20.
and I'm scared, man.
Justin, I'm scared.
I can't do this.
it's numbers, man. - This is too much.
it's not legal.
you're all that I have. You don't do this... - mike, come on.
if you do not do this, and then this time tomorrow, they're gonna take me out.
is that what you want?
is that what you want?!
Justin, these guys... these guys are crazy, man.
you still have that bravelink account I set up for you, right?
write down your account number and pin.
I can get into the system and make a deposit.
I'll bypass the atm withdrawal limit.
I knew you'd think of something, man.
Mike, this is not free money, okay?
anything you take out, you have to put back.
trust me, okay?
this is the last time.
okay, go. I'll call you when it's done.
ginger.
that should help.
Maya. With the morning sickness.
there's ginger tea and a peppermint rub.
Thanks, brenda. I'm sure she'll appreciate it.

it's not that simple.
they're professionals.
what about donna?
a team is seven. I got to make a choice.
some guy out at customer service says he really needs to see you.
what the hell are you doing here, mike?
jus, there's a change of plan.
what? - They want more.
$500, 000 into this account.
Oh, are you crazy, mike? I can't do that.
jus, don't panic and stay calm.
okay?
I was just sent this.
Justin, please.
they want their money by 6: 00.

so you can do it again.
it's too late.
they tripped the alarm. They tripped the alarm.

spike: Copy that.

Mike, who are these people?
look... look, we're on camera.
you look like a hostage, okay?
you let me take the blame for this.
it'll probably work out okay.

okay?
you have time to do your thing.
two minutes, we're done.
Maya's safe. Come on.
no, no, no, no, no, listen.

Hey, eddie, you hear that?
Yeah, he wants time.
Yeah, but for what?

Sam and wordy are going to enter the fire exit and extract the hostages.
Donna and I are going to go down the central staircase.
okay, that sounds good.
spike, we need eyes in. Come on.
security system's got extra firewalls.
it's hard to get access from outside the building.
downloading the codes now, eyes in five.

I see the setback. It's all over my tv.

I got to buy some trust.
I'll be back.
nobody move.
Mike mckewon. He's our guy. He's got a record.
mostly petty stuff.
nothing violent: B&es, possession with intent to sell, credit card fraud.
guy's all over the map.
one thing in common, though: Fast cash.
so you think we're dealing with an addict?
well, scores every few months.
he's feeding some kind of habit or he's paying off some loans.
spike, come on.
show starts in three, two...
what's he doing?
you seeing this eddie?
Yeah.
looks like our guy's letting his guard down.
or waiting for something.
won't be waiting long.
we're going in.
Yes!
you got it?
Yeah, I got it.
okay, I've tapped you into the cctv so you can see everything now.
we start talking to the cops, you will know it.
okay.
so I'll watch it with your girl here.
you make sure you keep your promise.
Hey, you got a problem.
Justin: Damn it. Okay, okay... okay, okay...
I'll take care of it, all right? Just don't hurt her, please?
hostages are in range.
preparing distraction.
on your go, eddie.
don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
don't come any closer!
okay, mike?
let's just take this slow.
I said don't come any closer or I shoot him!
please!
he'll do it!
jus, they've got our hostages.
you've got me, so just... keep cool.
Yeah.
calmly and quickly leave the building.
keep your heads down.
there's no way out, jus.
I'm going to jail. They got guys on the inside. I'm dead, man.
this is not about you. This is about maya.
there's no way out.
we need police protection.
we've got to talk.
Maya... they're watcng.
okay, mike, we all want this to end peacefully, so just put down the gun.
all right, just put it down, and we can all... we can all walk out of here.
it's not looking good for you.
it's time to send a message.
be cool, jus. Jus...
Mike... they're watching.
there's no way out.
jus, we're done. We're done. We're done.
don't worry, buddy.
Justin... please!
don't let mike give up!
they say they'll hurt me and the baby.
it's not over!
stage has the weapon.
repeat, hostage has the weapon.
damn it. - Back off!
and don't interfere!
no solution.
this is not over!
obstruction. No solution.
talk to me, boss.
team one, stand down.
fall back. Fall back.
copy that.
what's going on?
you know something we don't?
Yeah, they're not the threat, eddie.
we've just intercepted that cell phone call.
go ahead, lou.
Justin, please.
don't let mike give up!
they say they'll hurt me and the baby.
man, that was crazy.
you son of a bitch! You were going to give up!
what are you talking about?
you got us into this and you were just going to bail?!
jus... - they're going to kill maya and the baby.
what do you mean "baby"?
what baby?! - What baby? Maya's pregnant?
how could you do this to me, mike?
jus, I... - how could you possibly do this to me?!
I didn't know, jus. I'm sorry, okay? Justin, I'm sorry!
you're always sorry!
and you always call me to bail you out!
Yeah, I do.
I make mistakes, okay?
I know I do.
I make lots of mistakes! I know!
I'm sorry I didn't have the luck to be born like you with the luck that you have!
what else do you want me to say?
the next time you screw up, call someone else.
there is no one else.
you know that.
let's, uh... let's just get the codes and do this.
so anything you can come up with would be really helpful.
did they seem to be familiar with one another?
5: 33 P. M.12 hostages secured. To subjects still armed and active.
a mike mckewon and an employee identified by his manager-- justin fraser.
Justin, please... don't let mike give up!
this is livideo nk they just sent justin. -They said they'd hurt me and the baby.
okay, new deal, ed.
these guys are acting under duress.
someone's holding the employee's wife.
colleagues say she's seven months pregnant.
it also sounds like they seem to know each other, boss.
if they know each other, what's their connection?
Lewis, did you track the source?
Yeah, prepaid cell, no gps.
manager said they were trying to wire money into an offshore account, but they didn't have the right codes.
they still think they can do it.
and that's why they won't give up.
if someone had sophie, would you?
Winnie, mike mckewon and justin fraser.
we need a connection. See who could be pulling their strings and from where asap.
copy.
boss, whoever it is, I think they're watching.
that's what justin was doing.
he uplinked the security system to an ftp.
if you give someone the web address they can see what we see.
the guy's pretty good.
want me to interrupt the feed, block the bad guy's view?
negative.
ed, this is why justin told us not to interfere.
the kidnapper will keep the wife alive as long as he thinks he'll still get his money.
I want to believe the wife's still alive.
and we can use this to our advantage.
so we keep them in the game till we figure out where they are?
Yeah. -All right.
Sarge, uniforms confirm no sign of maya fraser at the house.
and they report signs of forced entry.
Thanks, winnie.
I got a hit on your guy justin fraser.
in crimal record? -No, family services.
go ahead.
okay, both parents deceased. Looks like he was 13.
he was transferred to the custody of a jack fraser.
uncle, in brampton.
okay, let's get ahold of the uncle.
see if he can tell us what justin's got himself involved in.
you got it.
so how are you going to find these codes we need?
the override codes change every few weeks, so the execs have go w toherite tm down somewhere.
Mike: What are we looking for?
it's, uh, it's usually something personal.
like A... like a birthda or a cat?
Justin's a good kid.
smart.
my brother's son. He came to live with me after he lost his parents.
so what happened to the parents?
uh... car accident.
as far as you know, justin isn't involved in illegal activities?
well, he studied his butt off to get where he is, maya's expecting
no, I... I don't see him throwing that away.
well, are they okay?
what do you know about mike mckewon?
Oh, so this is about mike.
no.
look, I had three kids of my own, okay?
I couldn't take them both.
besides, he was 17. He was old enough to be on his own.
so you're saying justin and mike are brothers?
no, no, half.
his mom remarried my brother when mike was two or three.
then they had justin.
but the kid's always been trouble.
not even my brother could handle him. There was no way I could take that on.
so after the accident, justin got a home, and mike was left to look out for himself?
Yeah.
are you in?
Yeah.
how'd you know the name of the cat?
I didn't.
the password is on the back.
okay, all right, it's scanning the system for the codes now.
once we get them, we take them down to the secure servers in the basement, input them, send the cash.
then they let maya go.
how long has maya been pregnant?
seven months.
you got a boy or a girl?
we don't know, mike. We were going to wait.
I'm sorry.
I've been working on the video attachment for mike's phone.
Justin... please.
they want their money by 6: 00 or they say they'll... they'll kill me.
you hear that? Sirens.
sounds like a cruiser.
they want their money by 6: 00... -and an ambulance.
...or they say they'll kill... -the message was sent at 5: 01 P. M.
I got winnie to send me the info on all cruiser and ambulance calls at 5: 01.
three cruisers, one ambulance.
say she's downtown.
she could either be here, here or here-- wellington and john.
club district. -Exactly.
nice work, spike. -And here, there's more.
we've got a corner of a window.
arched window, stained glas it could be a church.
no, not at wellington and john.
no, no, no, that's the Viper-- a night club.
I did a drug case in there.
you sure about this?
Yeah, that makes sense. I mean, most of the ubs in that area are hot with drug traffic.
mostly gang controlled.
a gang would have what it takes to pull this off?
that is the viper. I know the windows.
club's five minutes from here.
okay, winnie, let's deploy team four to viper nightclub.
no, sorry. Team four was dispatched 20 minutes ago, sarge.
domestic gun call in rexdale.
I'll put team three on standby.
it'll take them at least half an hour just to deploy.
all right, we can be there in five.
our hands are tied here. Besides, the threat's at the club.
okay, you go. Lou, spike and I will alpha here.
Lewis, call guns and gangs. See if anything flags.
copy that.
all right, the rest of us bravo at the club. Fast is good. We got a 6: 00 deadline.
let's stay off the news.
wait... I got it.
boss, got a call going out.
Yeah.
okay, we've got them-- the override codes to get into the system.
now you're going to get your money, but I want to hear her voice.
spike, where would you go with override codes?
basement. System would have to be rebooted from the secure servers there.
there's cctv in the basement hallways, but there's no eyes in the server room.
okay, well, eyes would be good.
turn the lights off in the hallways.
got it. Eyes flying in.
don't. No! No! No, please! Please, no!
we're gonna do a drive-by check for sentries.
if it's clear, we're gonna stage in the alley south of adee, full-on stealth approach.
bad news. Guns and gangs says viper's controlled by huesos de tigre.
south american bangers.
that fits.
they use someone on the inside to hit up the bank, and then they use kidnapping to make sure they cooperate.
le Gang unit's been profiling these guys since they moved in here three weeks ago.
my... my baby! Please!
this M. O. Goes one of two ways.
they either don't get the money and kill the hostage...
and two?
my baby, please... please!
they get the money.
and they still kill the hostage.
we'll cross between the buildings.
we'll access through the roof.
copy that.
we've I. D.'D two of them.
okay, there's an oscar cardoza and a hector puente.
just the two?
no, they say there's four, maybe five, start-up crew.
could it be more? There's no way to know for sure.
Sam, you're sierra.
copy that.
spike: I'm in the basement and approaching the server room.

Stayedceal, spike.
or the bad guy pulls the plug. Copy, boss.
that's the sver?
I got to enter the codes and reboot.
we get into the system and make the transfer.

I've got three minutes left. -Don't play with me, man.

what, do you want a million dollars in your account or a mess on the floor?
I am going as fast as I can, so let me do this!
single subject. Armed.

jus? -I know, I know.
come on, come on, come on.
done.
no, no, no, no, no!
what is it? Justin, what'soing on?
Justin?! Justin, what is it?
it's over. -It's over?
sounds like he didn't get through. Maybe the codes were expired, the system time-bombed...
Bravo team, deal might have fallen through. What's your 20?
one floor away.
boss, got a call going out.
I'm ready.
but I'm not doing it until I know maya's alive. So will you put her on the phone?
Hey, sweetie.
are you okay?
did they... did...?
no.
I'm okay.
you got their money?
I tried.
I did.
I know you did.
I know.
have I ever told you how much I love you?
okay, you talked.
Justin: You'll have your money in a minute.
so your brother was right.
what? -Spike, stay alert.
Mike mckewonay be closer to this gang than we thought.
copy, boss.
he's always talkg about you, man.
you're the smart one, right?
you know him?
he wasn't doing too good today, man, you know?
and then he tells us,"my brother justin, he works for a bank,"
and that you'd take care of it... like you always do.
he's a lucky guy to have a brother like you.
spike, stay close. We got a situation.
jus, jus, look, there's gotta be something else we can do, right?
you know? We can do something else, man. Come on.
just get back in there and, um... right, jus?
I'll take care of things... like I always do.
jus, man, what the hell, man?
get the, get the, get the gun off me.
you said you didn't know them.
they knew you. And you told them I work at a bank.
no, no, man, that's not what happened.
stop lying to me!
spike, he's not picking up. You get in there. We're on our way.
Mike: No, that's not what happened.
sru! Drop your weapon!
my wife is dead, so you...you do what you need to do.
it doesn't matter anymore.
Justin, we're working on getting your wife out safely.
you told them that I would do this for you, because...
because I always cave, right? Because I always say yes.
they were gonna kill me, man.
so you sell me out?
and maya?
okay, I do know those guys, I know 'em.
but I never thought they'd take maya, man.
I didn't even know about the half a million.
so you're just stupid.
and now you've killed my wife and my baby.
parker: Justin, we know where your wife is.
we're here to help you.
my team is working on getting her right now.
you're lying. -No, no.
we're doing everything we can to make sure she comes out of there safely, but hurting your brother's not gonna help anything.
this is his fault.
this is your fault!
he wrecks everything es touch!
blaming him's not the answer, my man.
you both lost your parents.
I can't even imagine what that was like.
and then you both had to go your separate ways, but you got to stay with family.
Mike wasn't so lucky, was he?
he made his own luck.
he's been making his luck ever since.
Yeah, I'm just saying from his point of view, you got the roof over your head, you got to go to school.
so when he's in trouble he comes to you because you owe him, right?
so he messes up, you always help him.
he counts on you, and you never let him down.
so, this is my fault?
I think your only fault is that you're always helping him.
it's hard not to help someone you love, though, right?
so, come on, my man.
let someone help you for once.
we're gonna get your wife out of there.
we're gonna get your wife out.
get your hands on your head!
hands on your head! Hands on your head!
boss, we're at the door.
answer the phone.
spread the word, man,'cause this is what happens when you break your promise with huesos de tigres!
no, please don't. Don't do anything to her, please.
you listening?
no, no, no!
cause this is what it sounds like!
sru! Get down on the ground!
stay down on the ground or you will be shot!
do not move! Do not move!
t it pu down. Put the gun down.
you heard me. Put it down.
back off or I'll kill the bitch!
no solution.
Sierra... -no solution.
it's over.
what's going on?! What happened?!
hostage secured. We got her.
it's okay. We got you.
it's okay.
you're all right.
let me hear her voice. Let me hear her.
Eddie, put her on.
how's donna? She done with siu?
you know, we were lucky to have her there today.
we're lucky to have her, You know?
and I've been thinking, she's as good as any one of us.
any one of us, greg. Maybe even better.
and you're asking why I'not putting the best person for the job on the team?
it's crossed my mind.
Heea a tm's alchemy.
it's more than the sum of its parts, right?
Donna is great, but jules is... -jules is family, and I get that.
and I'm behind you a hundred percent, and you know that.
and I will welcome her back with open arms.
she's a great team member.
but I gotta ask you: When the call comes in, are we sending in a swat team or are we sending in family?
got a sec?
Yeah, come on in.
Hey, you were excellent out there today.
excellent, and I want you to know that.
thank you.
Donna... -can I make this easier on you?
team three's got a spot for me.
they say, got my name all over it.
and how do you feel about that?
I'm not here to upset your team's center of gravity.
call me if you need me.
you need me, I'm gonna be here.
where you going?
I'm gonna go see some friends.
No! - Those guys are not your friends.
you're just business to them. - Just let go.
no. I am not gonna let them suck the life out of you.
come on, Jimmy!
help me save him!
he's my brother! Come on, Jimmy!
it's too late.
uh, excuse me.
I heard you threw Donnie outta here last night.
is that true?
is it true?
this is my place. I get to decide who comes in, who doesn't.
what do you got against our friend Donnie?
I mean what's wrong with a guy who wants to sit at a bar and have a quiet conversation?
I don't like him doing business in my place.
he's welcome to do it someplace else.
you're messing with our business.
and when you mess with our business, we mess with yours.
bar owner: What're you doing?
no, don't! Please!
Oh, you sons of bitches!
language!
this is a family establishment.
come on, guys!
let's talk this over!
please.
he's the local dealer.
stop!
you have to get down here.
the Gatto Nero. College street.
stop!
you don't need to do that, guys!
stop!
bastards!
don't touch that! Don't touch that.
no. It belonged to my wife.
what do you think, Vince?
nice! - Crystal. You know, I bought some like this for my mom once.
cost a couple stacks.
what's this cost? - It's not about what it costs.
please.
please.
back off!
your call.
Oh, my god!
he has a gun. Please hurry!
you all right?
Yeah, yeah.
watch it!
Wh-what're you doing? Let it go.
I'm not letting it go.
Oh, Shelley, one more thing... Um, you want to go to eddie's tonight?
barbeque, kids.
what time? - I don't know. Like 6: 00?
team one, hot call.
12 clouster street. Shots fired.
better make it 8: 00.
eight o'clock. Love ya, gotta go.
team one, seconds away.
copy.
copy, copy. Command truck's on its way.
first responder? Talk to me fast, officer.
we've got two males, baseball bats and a handgun, start tearing the place apart.
a patron jumps in, the gun discharges, everybody runs.
whose gun?
the guys wrecking the bar.
you get a description? - Yup.
mid-20s, long coats.
one's 6'4" with dreadlocks, injury on the right arm.
the other's a small build, jeans, black t-shirt.
no word on the good Samaritan.
the good Samaritan?
Sam, you get those descriptions?
Yeah. Well, we're right behind them.
we move fast... - We can bring 'em in.
okay, we work a grid.
Wordy, you are alpha with me. We will work north and south.
Sam, Leah, bravo, east and west. Let's move it.
Jules, let's see what we can find out.
do you know why these men would be targeting your place?
they're drug dealers.
I threw out one of their friends last night.
you stood up to them.
this is what it got me.
you know the men who did this?
leon is the little one. Vince is the big one. That's all I know.
and who's the man who attacked them?
he didn't attack them.
he chased them out.
I didn't get a look at him.
did he take his handgun?
two against one. I'm just wondering how he managed to chase them out?
Yeah, he had the gun.
it's sick.
what are you talking about?
I grew up here.
I didn't know that.
used to be kids in the streets all hours, hide and seek, people outside on their patios.
you sitting on the back of a pickup, strummin' your first guitar.
I just hate to see what's happened.
I hear you, Wordy, but you gotta talk to city hall.
there were a lot more cops on the street back then.
team one, turns out our good Samaritan is armed.
got I.D?
not yet, but he may be going after the same target as you.
so what? We've got some citizen trying to be a vigilante?
looks that way.
vigilante? - What would you call him?
some guys try to intimidate a local businessman, and this guy steps up, fights back... I'd call him a good citizen.
a good citizen in pursuit with a firearm.
it's okay, it's okay.
how you doing, Leon?
I'm good. How about you?
proud of yourself? You get a rush out of what you did? Huh?
takes a big man to bust up someone's place, someone's treasures; pieces of a life that they actually worked for.
takes a real big man.
what do you want? You just tell me what you want.
so you got no idea what he looks like - tall, short, heavyset, blond, brunette... Stop me here.
no? Nothing's coming to you?
everything happened really fast.
you got a pretty good look at the other two guys.
Alphonse, look, I realize he did you a favour.
but he chased two men out of here with a loaded weapon, and we'd like to help him before he gets in too deep.
I never saw him before.
you sure about that? - Absolutely.
what about you, ma'am? Do you remember anything?
I just... I was in the back here.
I didn't see the guy at all.
ed, uniforms called in a man in dreads in a long coat running south on Parliament street.
dreadlocks, three o'clock!
in pursuit on foot, corner of Montrose and College.
ed, right there! Stay there! Right now!
do not move! Do not move!
give me your hands! Let me see your hands! Let me see your hands!
you got any weapons?! Get up!
it's dislocated.
what's your name? - What's your name?!
what's up, Eddie?
boss, we got one of the dealers.
the name he gave is Vince Packer.
okay, Spike, see if you can get anything on a Vince Packer.
on it, boss.
parker: Look for any connections to someone named Leon.
our friend Vince denies vandalizing "The Gatto Nero" or knowing anyone named Leon.
apparently he dislocated his shoulder playing hockey this morning, in a neighbourhood that lost its rink five years ago.
ed, your guy Vince?
he gets busted a lot for such a good athlete.
possession, assault... And look at this - last time he went down, he went down with fellow athlete Leon Weeks.
where can we find Mr. Weeks?
if he's headed home, he's right in the neighborhood.
211 Watson. That's Clouster and Watson.
two blocks from us. We're on it.
shots fired! Alley west of Clouster!
on it.
Sam, this guy's really a mess.
Winnie, we need an ambulance.
bad news, boss. The vigilante has kicked it up a notch.
Winnie, where's that ambulance?
sending emt's to your GPS location now.
talk to me, Sam.
the subject from the bar has been shot.
bullet wounds in both legs.
it's nasty, but it's not life-threatening.
looks like he was carrying some cocaine.
this is circumstantial!
you're Leon Weeks, right?
I want a lawyer. I know my rights.
we're not here about the drugs.
Oh, yeah. Right. I know how this works.
you're gonna plant some drugs, then you're gonna try and pin it on me.
leon, we just wanna know who shot you.
that's all.
Thanks, Leon, we've got the spelling. Spike, you copy that?
what? You know him? - Not well.
my dad and I used to hang out at his dad's hardware store all the time.
robert Cooper's taking this pretty personally, Leon.
was there something here you want to tell me, like why he'd want to shoot you?
the guy's a wacko.
he's out of control. You gotta stop him, okay?
maybe Cooper's not fond of people in your line of work.
I said this is circumstantial.
guys, listen to this.
a west end neighbourhood sentinel association won a court battle which would have the imperial arms apartments torn down.
president and local businessman, Robert Cooper, said the association has dealt a body blow to the drug dealers trying to take over our neighbourhood.
from community activist to vigilante.
I'm sending you a picture of him right now.
Alphonse... You know it's illegal to lie to the police, right?
robert Cooper was your good samaritan.
now how do you not recognize the president of your neighborhood sentinel?
I didn't want to get him in trouble.
he just shot a man. - Oh my god.
Yeah, might not have happened if you had given us a straight answer.
Alphonse, we need to bring him in here before he hurts anybody else.
you got an address, a phone number? Anything you got.
I don't know where he's living. You'll have to ask his wife.
so what's her name?
let's get her down here, Jules.
leon, we need to talk to you about your crew, buddy.
I don't know... What crew?
Cooper's declared war. You think he's gonna stop with you?
Leon: He wanted me to give up names and addresses for the guys i work with - the top guys.
did you tell him?
I don't know the top guys. I only talk to Torres.
Torres? - John Torres. He's the middle guy.
that's all I know. That's all I told him.
all right, let's see what we can find out about this Torres.
you think he's gonna go after every dealer in the area?
that could take a while in this neighbourhood.
sorry, Leah, what about this neighbourhood?
when I was a firefighter I took a lot of drug-related calls, especially in this neighbourhood.
but Bobby doesn't own a gun.
it appears he took it from one of the men that he assaulted this morning.
we believe Robert's been hunting down a local gang of drug dealers.
did you know that he was planning on doing something like that?
no. No. God, no.
I would have called the police immediately.
well, we need to know what made him do this. Can you tell us about his state of mind lately?
he's angry... About what happened to the neighbourhood, about what happened to his brother.
his brother?
Jimmy. He's... He's younger.
they never really had an easy time.
their mom died a long time ago, so it was just Bobby and Jimmy and their dad
they were close - And then me.
for a few years, we ran the store together.
we were happy.
we were good.
what happened?
their dad died... And Jimmy started using.
Jimmy became an addict?
not overnight. It was a long slide down.
we lost the Jimmy that we loved.
we tried to help him. We did the best we could.
Hey, how're you guys doing? What can I get ya?
I just got a call from Gordie. Where the hell were you?
Aw, Jeez. Man, 3:30.
you told me you wanted to work in the dealership.
I put my neck on the line, I get the job for you... - Okay, enough.
I get the message loud and clear.
I let you down... Again.
where are you going?
I'm gonna go meet some friends.
cooper: Hey, I know who you mean, and those guys are not your friends.
now you're gonna tell me who my friends are?
get the hell off me.
you're not their friend, Jimmy, okay?
you're just business to them.
you son of a bitch, just let go.
no, no. Hey, listen to me, all right?
I am not gonna let them suck the life out of you.
let me go. Just let... Go!
if you walk out of that door, I am done with you.
I didn't mean that.
Bobby! - No.
he's not gonna give up looking for him.
when was the last time you two spoke?
when he ran after Jimmy about two days ago.
do you mind me asking why he left?
losing the store, losing Jimmy... I mean he's a good guy.
he's lost. It's just eating him up.
just uh... Hold on a second.
okay, team, new deal.
robert Cooper's got a little brother, Jimmy.
Jimmy got hooked with the local dealers... And now Robert's trying to track them down.
so, it's personal.
Yeah, it's starting to look that way.
boss, I did a credit card search on Cooper.
good work, Spike. Whatchya got?
I got an address.
he just moved into a by-the-week rooming house.
112 Mcarthur.
team one, seconds away.
I'm gonna apologize to Wordy.
he's got a real connection to this place.
I didn't need to push.
word of advice for the rookie from the last one?
when I joined the team I made a lot of mistakes, I did my share of apologizing.
but the one thing I never had to apologize for was speaking my mind.
you see something you think affects the call, like your general impression of a neighbourhood based on professional experience, you say it.
what's up?
you tell me.
uh, I don't know, you know, busy... Workin'.
I'm coming out of my house this morning and two high-ranking security agents want to take me out for coffee.
Oh... That.
Yeah, that.
and they wanna talk to me about you.
it's not what you think.
no? - No.
okay.
we'll pick this up later, all right?
second floor, end of the hall.
Wordy, you're alpha with me.
Sam, Leah - bravo.
let's do it.
police, freeze! Police! Police!
clear.
boss, Cooper's not here.
Thanks, Eddie.
the neighbourhood sentinel seemed like they were getting somewhere, so why would robert do something like this?
things started turning bad when the family business burnt down.
the hardware store? When was that?
a few weeks ago. Bobby was sure it was the drug dealers out to get him.
what? Because the sentinel had closed down one of their buildings?
Yeah, retaliation.
the family store meant a lot to him.
but, you know, he didn't talk about his feelings.
but he was taking it pretty hard.
well, he hated feeling helpless.
he became obsessed with fixing things, like his dad.
it was all about fixing things.
but this wasn't something that he could fix and he wouldn't talk about it, not even Patty.
after a few weeks, he just... He lost it.
so he left his wife, moved in here.
pictures of his family; that's a good sign.
used to go to that store every halloween.
old man Cooper really went all out.
it's a shame that place is gone.
boss, I found Cooper's brother.
that's good. How soon can we get him here?
he's not going anywhere.
why not? - He's in the morgue.
Jimmy Cooper O.D.D. early this morning.
who found Jimmy Cooper's body?
dispatch said it was an anonymous 911 call.
someone saw him having a seizure right in the middle of the street.
at least someone cared enough to call it in.
think Cooper knows his brother died?
if he does, it could have been the trigger.
I'm gonna talk to the paramedics involved.
I guess I go tell Patty.
spike, I've got some friends at guns and gangs.
see if you can get some intel on John Torres.
the middle man. Copy.
all right, we find Torres, maybe we'll find Cooper
so, Michaelangelo, international man of mystery.
he told you? - Yeah.
he's not happy.
he doesn't like to see the family break up.
tell me about it.
but he's proud of you. - Really?
federal agency seeks you out? That's a big deal.
yeah?
Y- eah.- Yeah. Thanks, Jules.
so, is this the guy from last night?
Yeah, that was him.
came running over when he saw us working on his brother.
he totally freaked out.
so was the brother still alive when Cooper got to him?
he was circling the drain, but Cooper wouldn't give up on him.
clear! Charge to 360.
and clear!
come on, Jimmy. Come on, Jimmy, stay with me.
stay with me, buddy, come on.
come on.
I'm sorry, he's gone.
no, no he's not. Keep trying!
I'm sorry. - No!
come on, Jimmy.
I'm sorry, sir, you have to let him go.
No!
come on, Jimmy.
Jimmy! Jimmy, please!
No! No, he's not some junkie!
he's my brother!
he's my brother!
it's too late, sir.
I'm sorry.
No!
Thanks, guys.
seeing your kid brother die right in front of you...
so he's upset about his brother's death, and blames it on the people who sold him drugs.
and now he's out for blood.
guys, that middle man Leon mentioned, John Torres, his name comes up in connection with the Steele brothers.
the Steele brothers.
I've heard that name before.
Yeah, real up and comers.
they allegedly run the coke trade this end of town.
why allegedly?
drug squad's been building a file.
the Steele brothers, they come from money.
mom and dad disowned them, but not before grady used daddy's money to buy into the trade big time.
looks like his kid brother Dru got into the business, too.
they got money, they move around.
Yeah, and the cops have never been able to touch 'em.
I guess they keep a pretty low profile.
they're most likely cooper's number one target.
so we'd better find them before Cooper does.
we got an address on the Steele brothers?
no last known. Like I said, they move around.
but what I do have is a lead on their middle man, John Torres.
I'm sending you photos.
Torres does business out of a blue panel van with spoke rims.
perfect mobile office.
normally trolls the area between Bloor and Gerrard.
spike, let's access city traffic cameras, help us narrow down the search.
on it.
okay, guys, let's work the grid.
let's go.
problem? - No problem.
anyone have eyes?
negative.
still looking.
Wordy, you got something to say, spit it out.
we protect drug dealers now?
we keep the peace.
if that includes stopping some guy from shooting up a bunch of drug dealers, then, yeah, that's what we do.
great, so, when we catch up to him and he doesn't share our feelings about civic order...
we make him listen.
and if he doesn't listen, and it's down to him or the drug dealer?
Yeah, Leah.
when bullets start flying, they don't just hit drug dealers.
Wordy, we protect everybody, all right?
we protect the families, and, yeah, we protect the dealers.
and we protect Cooper.
I mean who do you think's gonna be more familiar with the use of firearms?
all right, we got three vans matching the description in your vicinity.
someone reported music blaring from a blue panel van parked behind Wayne's tavern.
uni in the area confirmed the van had spoke rims.
I'm betting that's our guy.
team one, move in!
the cab's empty.
check the back.
I can't see in.
the door's locked.
Mr. Torres, this is the police!
please exit your vehicle!
can't hear anything over that music, Eddie!
Wordy, let's go! Let's go!
stack it up.
police!
looks like Cooper beat us here.
he's been shot in the stomach.
Winnie, we need an emt here immediately.
copy that.
never thought I'd be... So happy to see the cops.
did Cooper do this to you?
how long ago?
don't know!
half hour, maybe.
let me guess: He was looking for the Steele brothers.
did you tell him where they're at?
no choice!
what's the address?!
Mr. Torres, I know you don't want to give up your bosses, but unless you tell us where they are, Robert Cooper gonna kill 'em.
the Steele brothers can handle Cooper.
he got the drop on you, didn't he?
the emt's are here, but they won't treat you 'til we give them the all clear.
24 Aynes road.
Aynes. Thank you.
we got an address.
let's go!
let the emt's through!
Patty, it's me.
Oh, bobby, thank god!
are you okay?
Winnie, put a trace on Patty Cooper's cell phone.
I'm on it.
listen, I heard about Jimmy.
I am so sorry!
please, bobby, just come home!
Patty, listen to me... Bobby, you're scaring me!
please come home!
there's something I've gotta do.
it's, it's nearly over.
Bobby, you're scaring me! Okay?
just come home!
and no matter what happens I need...
no matter what happens, I need you to know that I love you.
where are you?!
I'll come get you!
Oh, Bobby!
he's gone.
sorry, Jules, I didn't get it.
Sarge, Cooper contacted his wife.
you get a lock on his location?
no, it was too quick.
but he said that he needed to do something and that he loves her.
either way, he knows it's not gonna end well.
what the hell's going on here?
the cops are all over Torres, and not just regular cops.
SWAT.
Torres is not gonna talk.
I don't wanna go to jail, man.
no one is going to jail.
we need to clear the supply and lay low for a while.
just... Just 'til the dust settles.
Hey, listen!
the cops are always gonna be after us, Dru.
the trick is not to panic.
when you panic, you make mistakes.
I don't know, man.
okay, this is why... Come on, grady - you freak out over everything.
that's not true.
if you don't have the stomach for this... I do.
I swear.
Really? Yeah.
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.
now put this back where it belongs.
Hey, I got us tickets to the game tonight.
I don't think you're gonna make it.
that's a lot of money you've got there.
who the hell are you?
you want it?
it's yours.
just let him go.
you must make a good living.
$50, 000 - all yours.
just let him go and walk out that door.
is that's all your brother's life is worth to you, hmm?
$50 grand?
I can give you whatever you want.
whatever I want, huh?
name it.
I want my brother back.
you killed him.
you killed Jimmy.
I don't even know anyone named Jimmy.
he was one of your best customers!
we don't know our customers.
you don't know your... He died early this morning!
Overdose!
okay, man, I'm sorry.
that's rough.
I tried to help him, but I couldn't.
does that seem right to you?
Cooper's armed.
we have every reason to believe the Steele brothers are armed.
but we go in aggressive, we could trigger a firefight.
can't go in without intel.
Wordy, Leah - eyes. - Got it.
Sam... I'll find a perch.
transmitting.
boss, we're good.
all right, he's got 'em.
look at him.
his arm's shaking, he's breathing hard.
he's working up the courage to kill them.
we're running out of time.
Sam, do you have the solution?
negative.
let's bring Patty down here, maybe she can help us get through to her husband.
copy that. Come with me.
did they find Bobby?
Yeah, I'm gonna take you to him. Come on.
please, don't.
okay there, easy, easy, easy.
open that bag of coke and pour it on the table.
okay, no problem.
how much do you want?
the whole bag.
okay. All right.
they're breaking out the drugs.
I didn't think Cooper was a user.
as far as we know, he isn't.
you know my brother was so high once he went right through a plate glass window.
there was blood everywhere, but, Jimmy, he didn't even know he was hurt.
that's what this stuff did to him.
do you want me to cut it for you?
it's not for me. It's for him.
I don't touch that crap!
okay, we just sell! We don't use.
Hey, if it's good enough for my brother, it's good enough for yours!
get down!
okay, okay! All right, all right!
you want him to do a line?
that's cool, man.
no, not a line.
all of it.
that'll kill him.
okay.
No!
let him go, man! Let him go, man!
let him go!
this is sergeant Gregory Parker with the police strategic response unit.
I need you to put down your weapon and exit through the front door of the house immediately!
come on! Do it!
there's cops all around us, man!
you're done!
now let him go and give yourself up!
shut up!
Mr. Cooper, I need you to stay away from the front windows
we'll be breaking the glass and sending a phone in.
I need you to pick it up and talk to me, all right?
just a little privacy.
just you and me.
I think they want you to answer it.
I said shut up!
answer the damn phone!
well, he's not picking up, but at least we got ears.
come on, Cooper.
if you were gonna shoot us, you'd have done it by now.
Grady... We didn't... We didn't kill your brother, man.
Yes, you did!
he did it to himself.
he's escalating him.
we didn't force him to take drugs!
that was all on him!
he's trying to distract him, throw him off his game.
you say you love your brother, why didn't you stop him from using?
shut up.
maybe an intervention.
you better shut your mouth!
immediate action, white door.
go in now, now!
everyone fall back!
fall back! Fall back!
status, status!
no harm.
I think he's trying to force our hand, to get us to storm in and end this.
okay, that makes sense.
that makes sense.
he's never shot to kill before.
he wants us to do it for him.
no one's dying today.
Sam, what do you got?
two entrances, living room.
two bedrooms upstairs.
you got a basement?
Yeah.
okay, where do the stairs lead?
back entrance goes straight into the basement.
basement stairs go right up to the kitchen into the living room.
right to the target.
looks like it.
all right.
let's stack it up. Watch the windows.
got it.
Wordy, you're on point.
alpha team, move in.
don't speak! Do not speak!
shoot him!
we're not here to hurt anyone!
no, shoot him!
he's gonna kill my brother!
nobody's gonna get shot today, Robert.
Oh, so now you show up?
all these years, begging for your help while these guys take over.
I hear you, buddy.
I hear you.
I just need you to put that gun down.
they destroyed everything that my father ever built!
we know what you lost, Robert!
they killed my brother.
I'm gonna put my weapon down so we can talk, okay?
Robert, my name is Kevin Wordsworth.
my friends call me Wordy.
I loved your dad's store.
what?
Yeah, he had a rack of those old dime-store westerns, but nobody ever bought 'em.
he let me just hang out and read 'em.
he never kicked me out for not buying.
that's the kind of man he was.
what, you think that I don't know that he was a good man?
he worked his hands to the bone!
and then these... Low-lifes, they come along and...
Wordy, we've got Cooper's wife, Patty, here with us.
she's gonna help us out.
your wife is here, Robert.
she's real worried about you.
no, no, no, no, I have to do this, all right?
I have to do this for my brother Jimmy.
listen, I loved Jimmy, too, but I know that he wouldn't want Bobby to do this.
she's telling me that Jimmy wouldn't want you to throw your life away.
there is no life!
there is no life.
they took away anything that ever mattered to me!
what about Patty?
she's right here and she loves you.
she's better off without me.
No!
that's not true.
we were gonna start a family.
Patty's all about your future.
you were gonna have kids.
Robert... You want to honour your brother's memory?
start living again.
no one is better off without you.
it's not right.
it's not right!
they should pay for what they did!
I know.
okay, that's why I became a cop and not a cowboy.
I'll make sure... I'll make sure they get what's coming to them.
but not like this.
Bob, put the down.
come on, man.
we gotta do this the right way, Coop.
put the gun down.
come on, please.
let's do this together, huh?
you and me.
come on.

drop it, drop it.
now, get down on your knees.
that's it. That's it.
hands behind your head.
good job.
thank you! Thank you.
I've been thinking.
you know, it's not like by the middle of next month they'll have found all the international bad guys and I'll have missed my chance.
a guy could stay pretty busy keeping the peace in his own backyard.
you did good in there. Thanks.
one good thing came out of all this.
Cooper kept them so busy...
they never had time to get rid of the goods.
looks like they're going away for a long time.
so tonight at 8: 00, or what?
can I get a rain check on the barbecue?
I, uh, have some phone calls I have to make.
no problem. Yeah?
I told 'em, Michaelangelo Scarlatti, code name "Spike," is a disgrace to the force.
I mean he cracks under pressure.
he can't shoot his way out of a paper bag.
he can't be trusted with sensitive information on a surprise party, let alone national security.
he can't type if his life depended on it.
no, wait, that's what I wanted to say.
I mean you get to see the world, international intrigue.

constable, I need your rifle and your kit.
now you're under investigation; you know the drill.
whenever you're ready.
now, you know you're sequestered, there's no talking, okay?
we needed to barricade the doors so people couldn't come in and out, all right?
Greg. That went down fast.
Lewis has the transcripts in the truck.
I want another staging area for that media; move it. - Yes sir.
it was by the book, norm. - Yeah?
that'll be for special investigations to decide.
well, thank you, stainton. Ed? This was you?
you know better than to talk to subject officers, commander.
thank you, inspector.
good job, constable.
Parker, let's go, siu's waiting.
how ya doin', eddie? - Parker.
you mind just plugging your earholes for a second while I talk to my buddy here and ask how he's doing?
how ya doin'? - I'm fine. Fine.
Hey, ed, it was a good job.
saw the whole thing.
I'm sam. Sam braddock.
good for you.

Braddock, your instructions were to report to the station.
sorry, sir, I heard it on the radio, I didn't want to miss it.
good work, team one. Team three will relieve you.
Siu needs witness statements then see dr. Luria for a debrief.
Braddock, come with me.
nice post-incident reflexes, guys.
in the hostage taking that shook the downtown core, police confirm the hostage is unharmed, but is obviously shaken.
according to reports, the gunman...
Blair kowalski, special investigations unit. How you doin'?
okay, let's start with the vest. I need your vest.
vest.
shirt.
boots.
pants.
you didn't wait.
just bagging the clothes.
they say debriefing and you take it literally?
did you say anything?
you don't have to say anything to him.
that's your right, okay?
Frank mcandrew, I'm your lawyer, all right?
I'm gonna take care of all this. You have nothing to worry about, all right?
saw it on tv, that was great work.
Kowalski, this is a no-brainer.
no pun intended.
do you wanna talk to him now or what?
okay.
what exactly do you mean,"he called scorpio"?
he means he got the order.
when you say you "got the order..."
you gonna get that?
it's okay, it's my wife.
you can get that. If you want to get it, you can get it.
it's your right to talk to your wife.
Hey, soph.
Nah, I can't talk.
okay, I just wanted to know if that was that your team this morning?
Yeah.
that was you?
Yeah.
well, ah, we'll go home and wait for you there.
no, no, no, just... you know what? Just go to the thing, okay?
okay, eddie. Bye.
so, picking up, when you say you "got- - You saw it, didn't you?
just give him the use of force wheel. This is textbook.
just, uh, just show him. Give it to him.
when all reasonable efforts to de-escalate the situation fail and the suspect is threatening a member of the force, clearly progressing from "assaultive" to "grievous bodily harm," okay, there we have it! Okay?
are we done here, mr. Kowalski? - Just about.
were you aware that the suspect's son was at the scene?
my observer said there was a, uh, male youth.
and do you believe that every effort was made to involve the son in the negotiation as a third party intermediary?
yes I do.
and are you confident that all options were exhausted before the use of lethal force?
what, the option of watching him shoot my teammate?
I'll put that as a yes.
so you know, this is the process:
we investigate alongside the coroner's inquest and our director will deliver his statement as to whether or not there are reasonable grounds to believe that you or the other subject officer used excessive force.
he knows the process.
until that time, you're under investigation.
we recommend you take a break, spend some quality time with the family.
thank you, blair. - Good.
I'll see you at the inquest.
hold on, ed.
there's somebody else that you gotta talk to.
Hey, mom.
look... - I know, you're fine.
you did a great job out there, but you need somebody to talk to.
it's strictly confidential.
doc, if you want a date, just ask.
Oh, you know what? Screw it.
I forgot who I was talking to, for a minute.
you're not that guy.
you're not gonna wonder if you did the right thing.
you're not going to have any sleepless nights, flashbacks, memory loss, time distortions.
you're not gonna... feel alone, feel guilty.
feel guilty about not feeling guilty.
that's what happens to other people, you'll be fine.
you know where to find me. Not that you'll need to.
ed, it's time.
code of silence been lifted?
Yeah. - So how'd it go?
the way they do. - Are you good?
Yup. - Yeah?
piece of gum? Minty fresh.
listen, I saw you up there.
it was a clean shot.
Yeah, it was.
that guy knew what he was in for. You saved lives.
what I'd tell ya?
making the world safe so that others may eat pie. - Eat pie.
that's right.
let's hope the stockholm syndrome kicks finast.
Mr. Lane.
you better have an outstanding reason for being late.
good job, son.
and I am done.
as you were.
so we're gonna try this again.

congrats, man. - Cheers.
how you think eddie's gonna live without you, huh?
Aw, he'll be a lost man, I reckon. - Yeah.

what's up with that?
so, sam, how many al-qaeda guys you take out?
what, you mean like to dinner?
you gotta be wasted to take seven tases like that, right?
I could take seven. - Seven, what?
I could take seven tasers. - you couldn't take seven tasers.
you and parker island, right?
what happened in there?
I probably got tased seven times.
you know, everybody's on the same page.
what? What does that mean?
I'm fine.
you may want to do the math, one day, on all the "I'm fines."
dad, please, you should' t have...
go on. You say one more word. Just one.
okay, if this is what you want...
I work for the Strachan family in Rosedale.

three, two, one.
three, two, one.
2 hours earlier comfy there, Samo?
I'm very comfortable, sir.
get you some more coffee?
all good, sir, but thank you for asking.
what are you doing here, anyway?
cause you just had to bring it up?
well, constable Callaghan, that would be because yesterday I got...
tightest grouping at both long range and short range firearm practice.
meaning you get to do monthly cleanup, and I get to do this.
missed a spot there, Ed. - Yeah, whatever.
actually, what I meant is, why are you down here?
why aren't you upstairs training, you know, at something dangerous and exciting?
Sam, everything okay?
Yeah, I... I just gotta go do something.
final Homecoming for Three Heroes
wake up, boy.
Hello?
Jay, it's Braddock.
Sam, the hell time is it?
06:00, soldier.
you out of special forces now or what?
no, no, uh... in-between tours.
back to the sand in a week. You?
police force.
got tired of working for a living, huh?
Yeah, I guess.
so, Dave Haverlik... you hear?
anyways, figure I'll go up on the highway tonight.
you will?
died in the field, didn't he?
he wasn't in the field; he was at camp.
they hit the camp?
come on, man. You gonna make me say it?
all right, Chris Geordie found him.
I just know I ain't going up there.
just like we said, right?
right.
what are you talking about? Where up north?
it's a surprise.
what are you so up about? What do you have in there?
uh, you know, a little fun and games.
I guess it's me that gets to tell them your travel plans.
no, man.
why do you think I'm here?
I'm getting you out of here. You're coming with me.
where, up north? Why... why would I want to do that?
are you serious?
don't forget your bank card.
the units canceled mine.
dude, no. I just got my acceptance letters.
wow, what, you get into Harvard, too? - No.
dummy.
yeah,'cause nothing says "scholastic achievement" like the Baden-Highsmith military academy for young men.
Yeah, well, BH and I decided to reassess our educational relationship yesterday.
you had one year, RJ. One year, and you were home free.
have to toughen you up, obviously.
so, you gonna do what your big brother says?
you gonna come with me? - No.
no? Oh, okay, well, sure.
that's the way you feel, but why are you hitting yourself there, buddy?
it's okay, don't beat yourself up. - Rolland?
what are you doing here?
Hey, ma.
RJ, you can't be here.
he doesn't know.
I don't care.
Hilary? What are you doing out there?
well, he's up now.
margarite will set you a place for breakfast.
I'm not sitting down with you and him for breakfast.
there's no way.
so, uh, maybe later we can all go for a walk in the ravine.
I mean, we haven't done that in forever. Or maybe we could...
why, I'm fine, dad. And how are you?
could we please not do this, just once?
what I am doing is exerting every ounce of self-control I have not to ask the obvious question.
Oh, well, the answer is, uh, no.
your tie doesn't make your ass look fat.
you idiot.
this is what I mean.
you contemptible, ungrateful, stupid, vicious idiot.
Oh, it's funny, is it? You think it's funny? Well, then, laugh at this.
$36, 000 we spent to send you to that place, and if you think you are gonna drop out, then you will pay us back every single penny, do you understand?
do you understand? - No.
no, you don't understand? Even you can't be that stupid.
no, I'm not gonna pay you back because I never wanted to go there.
Rolland, where else could you go?
they were going to press charges for the fire...
so, then, let them press charges. Or don't.
protect the precious Strachan family name.
do what you feel. Send me a postcard. I'll be in the Yukon.
who do we know in the Yukon?
Oh, Hilary, shut up.
Simon's coming with me. He's the only reason I'm still here. Right, Simon?
no. Simon is going to a real school.
Simon is going to do what's expected of him.
because he is not a liar and a stupid fool and a coward.
dad, please, you don't have to...
go on. You say one more word. Just one.
okay, if this is what you want... here it is.
RJ, look at me.
you think I won't do this.
you don't think I'll do this?
if you had the guts, I might be afraid.
RJ. RJ, look at me. RJ!
you are so far in over your head.
you have no idea what you're doing, do you?
I work for the Strachan family in Rosedale.
they have a son.
he's going to kill Mr. Strachan. He's got a gun. Hurry.
so, I saw the paper. Is that guy from your team?
brave guys.
did I miss something?
he wasn't brave. He did it himself.
I'm sorry.
were you close?
spend enough time, think you know someone...and you had no idea, huh?
Sam, I'm just trying to help.
so, you gonna go to the highway and watch the procession?
no. - No? Don't you usually go?
on our team, the only thing protecting you is each other, so we made a deal.
you give up like that, you don't mean anything to us anymore.
team one, team one, hot call, gear up!
Sam, if you want to talk after...
Absolutely.
team leader, talk back.
go ahead, boss.
we copy, boss.
okay, RJ.
okay, it's you and me.
we can work this out together. - Yeah, how?
Yeah, Simon, please, come on, tell us all how.
okay, RJ. You're gonna give me the gun, we're gonna put it back, and then you're going back to BH.
no, I can't go back.
it's only for a few more months, you can hand it.
no, I mean, I can't go back-- ask mom.
Oh, well, what a surprise.
dad, shut up!
RJ, you can trust me, okay?
whatever it is, we can do this. Please, just give me the gun.
Oh, dear lord, no. Now look what you've done.
RJ, it's okay.
this is it.
what's he doing?
so much for the stealth approach.
SRU on the scene.
speak to you for a second?
Yes, sir, there's an armed teenager...
I assume you're new on the job.
Yes, sir.
here's today's lesson: Armed and barricaded subjects tend to get freaked out by sirens and flashing lights.
you get me?
I'll turn the lights off. - All right, move your car.
I'll move my car.
Sam, take the back entrance.
recognize the name?
crown V. Porter, trial of the century?
right, right. The defense attorney.
right, hence the mansion.
well, the family was loaded from way back. Gold mines.
anything you don't know?
okay, that's it. I've had enough of this.
dad! - Rolland!
your great-grandfather carried that gun across the Chilkoot pass.
your grandfather wore it on Juno beach.
does that mean anything to you at all?
it means that that gun was meant to be used by a man, which is why you can't do anything with it!
dad! Dad! Dad! - Simon, listen to me. Get out of the way!
No! Simon!
shot fired. Sam, you cover that back entrance.
team will attempt phone contact, but be ready for immediate entry.
no more.
RJ, no! What are you doing? Get out of the way!
wait, we can fix this! Okay?
team, you have eyes on subject?
negative.
all right, prepare for entry.
Oh, my god, Rolland!
this is the police strategic response unit.
everybody in the Strachan house needs to stay where they are!
clear on your count.
three, two, one.
I've got action here, smoke bombs! I need backup here.
I'm blind. I repeat. I need backup. I'm completely smoked out.
stop! Police!
team, subject's in the ravine.
looks like we've got a manhunt.
Wordy, containment?
can't really block off a ravine, but we've got all the bordering roads contained, checkpoints at every exit, uniforms are already out beating the bush.
all right, good.
we've got a few dozen hikers, bikers and family strollers.
let's clear them out, keep them safe in case our subject decides to do something stupid.
spike, how's the new toy?
acoustic detector's good to go.
he fires anywhere within earshot, we've got him.
excellent. - Yeah.
Wordy, I want you in the Hummer.
the rest of us, we will be heading into the bush, diamond formation.
one dog per unit.
let's keep to the grid. Let's clear it quad by quad.
keep in touch with the CP and the other uniforms.
boss, how's the infrared coming?
chopper arrive?
Yeah, it's messing up my hair.
better you than me.
infrared, two minutes away, Eddie.
outstanding.
Yeah, well, let's not forget our subject's 18 years old, emotionally distraught and afraid.
he may be armed, but he isn't Rambo.
let's see if we can bring him back to his family in one piece, okay?
I'll try, boss.
but those smoke bombs were pretty clever.
this guy's from around here. He knows the area.
all right, infrared coming at you.
gentlemen and lady...this is our forward looking infrared.
every dot is a heat signature, every heat signature could be our subject.
don't suppose they have an armed 18 year old filter for that thing?
afraid not. Quad by quad.
Hey, doc.
what do you know about the Baden-Highsmith academy for young men.
the military school? Not much. Your shooter from there?
Yeah, he was expelled recently.
a fight with another kid, the mother's saying.
expelled just for a fight?
you know, I was wondering the same thing, too. The parents aren't talking a lot.
preliminary profile?
pretty textbook: Well-to-do family, successful parents... one sibling.
he's got a history of antisocial acts beginning in adolescence:
fights, petty theft, and, uh, last year he was accused of starting a fire at his private school.
steady escalation.
you want to know, is this kid just a danger to himself, his family, or everybody else, too?
I love it when you read my mind.
just call when you know. - Okay.
if we could just go over what happened, Mr. Strachan. - No.
remember who you are.
infrared's up and running.
I'm headed east along the main road by the ravine.
what's your problem?
woods. My people don't like them.
your people? From Woodbridge?
no, Romans.
few times we fought in the forest against the Huns didn't go so good, okay?
team one, I've got two signs northeast of your position.
heads up, 25 meters and closing.
20 meters. 18 meters... 17...sixteen. 15, they're right on you.
Wordy, we've got two more negatives. Jules.
all right, girls. Come on, time to go home.
dozen more hot spots out there. Keep at it, guys.
Mrs. Strachan. My mom's exhausted. I can tell you everything.
my dad was sitting right there.
he was showing us our great-grandfather's old gun-- it's a family heirloom.
I know you're supposed to check if it's loaded.
I guess they didn't, and my brother took it, it just went off.
I mean, thank god it only hit my dad in the arm.
it was really just an accident.
all right, well, if it was just an accident, how come your brother took off?
uh, well... my brother's had a rough year. I guess...when he saw my dad hurt, he just panicked.
but, but he honestly didn't mean it. I know my brother.
okay, one more thing.
you're saying your father and brother were sitting here when the gun went off?
Yeah.
okay, well, if he was hit here, and your brother was sitting there, then the bullet would be somewhere around here.
but if they were standing, and your brother was pointing the gun...
then the bullet would be about here.
you want to try this again?
Yeah, yeah, fine. Just, do you mind if I check something?
where the hell are you?
you've got to help me, Simon.
what am I supposed to do, huh?
I mean, the cops are here and they've got, like, an entire army out looking for you, just come home.
mom's freaking out, dad's in the hospital.
is he going to be okay?
Yeah, I think so. - That's too bad.
RJ, what's going on with you?
Hey, don't worry about me. I'm fine, okay?
we just got to get up north and we'll be okay what "up north"? I don't even know what you mean.
come on, you remember those stories that dad told about the Chilkoot pass?
and his grandfather being up there, and how he made his name up there?
remember? - Yeah.
that's what we're gonna do; we're gonna go up there, we're gonna make our name.
making our names? What are you talking about?
what's going on? - It is, right?
we lose the trail?
there's ammonia splashed all over the place. Throws off the dogs.
I mean, what? This kid's holding ammonia in case of a manhunt?
Ammonia's good for a lot of stuff: Fertilizing, cleaning, bombs...
you getting this, boss?
Yeah, copy that.
I mean, we can be whatever we want to be up there.
nobody will know us.
okay, you'll be safe.
I've just got to get you away from them.
Yeah, but I am getting away. I'm going to school, remember?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're right, um...
what about me?
that's fine. You know what? It's fine. Don't worry about it. Do what you want, um...the least you can do is help me out, though.
I'm trying to help.
no, I need money to get up there.
you know what? Meet me at the place. You know where, by noon, okay?
do it or else... I gotta do something else, you know?
where are you going, Simon?
uh, I don't know. I have to go out.
yeah? Where? Mind if we tag along?
no, it's... nah, it's not that important.
your phone's buzzing.
is that your brother, Simon?
no. I don't know. - You didn't even check it.
let's get a listing of all the Strachan family phones, including RJ's cell.
you... you know I'm not going to tell you anything.
you might not mean to, but you are.
we're just trying to help your brother. You can help, too.
of course we want to help in any way we can.
then it would be helpful if you could tell me more about why you expelled RJ.
and as I've already explained, all I can tell you is that he was de-enrolled following an altercation with his cadet team leader.
well, was he alone in the altercation?
any other boys involved were dealt with appropriately.
to say anything more...requires written consent of his parents.
we don't have time for that right now.
if you want to help RJ, you'll help me...
I'm sorry, doctor, I've told you all I can.
now, you're welcome to take cadet Strachan' s file.
and please, give my regrets, and regards to his father.
it's about RJ?
you know RJ?
we're heading north on those coordinates.
triangulated signal from the kid's cell phone's up ahead.
only you guys showing up on infrared. Sorry.
got a visual on a domicile, 50 meters from our position.
still no infrared, guys.
the kid's got survival training, knows about camouflage.
he gets enough cover on top of him, he can hide his heat signature, so be careful.
this is the strategic response unit.
RJ, come on out, we don't want to hurt you. We can help.
give him a blast of CS gas.
boss, you sure about that reading?
he hasn't moved. Kid's playing possum.
we've got some news about RJ.
is he okay?
did you know he's been using crystal methamphetamine?
no, no, there's no way.
right now he's in an unstable state-- euphoria, paranoia, mania.
the fact that he's been using in the middle of all this, that tells us that he's bingeing, and he's headed for a major crash, okay?
so, we need to bring him back before he hurts himself more or anyone else.
I can't deal with this right now.
mom, please, what am I supposed to do?
you should leave. While you can. Before your father come back.
all I can do is say I'm sorry.
what else have I ever done?
hold it, I can help you with this.
okay. How?
I can show you where my brother's hiding just around that bend.
no trail here.
he's saying go through the thicket.
all right, it's pretty heavy brush.
extended line formation, ten to 15 meters apart. Let's go.
Hey, Sam. Walk away from the kid.
Jules told me about your buddy. My condolences.
anyway, you and the kid seem to have a good connection going.
he may open up more to you, and if he does I just need you to listen for some things.
I don't... that's really not my thing yet, boss.
no, no, no, you're doing fine. You're doing fine. Just trust your instincts.
this secret trail, hiding place from when they were kids, you buy it?
Yeah. He knows his brother. Where he's going.
okay then.
I think you need to ask him something.
whether he answers or not here's what we're looking for...
I've been worried about him. Is he okay?
hard to say. Cops haven't brought him in yet.
he's in a lot of trouble.
so you want to tell me about the meth, Torley?
look, I could care less about the "how" and "who" of this.
I just need to know "why."
RJ was different from the rest of us.
he worked hard, stayed out of trouble.
kept saying: One year and I'm outta here, one year.
was a good guy.
then one night he comes to me, he can't sleep.
he's having nightmares.
it turns out he doesn't want to sleep.
he wants to stay up. - So he starts taking meth?
taking it and making it; he loves chemistry.
but he didn't really lose it until the thing with the cadet leader, Simpson.
two nights ago, it's me, a couple other guys, RJ, we're partying.
simpson finds us, goes berserk, we're all going home, blah, blah, blah.
of course he comes at me first.
why of course?
because I'm half his size. He's just a douche that way.
but, so he-he grabs me, and RJ just goes off on him, starts kicking his ass, total hardcore.
simpson's still in the infirmary.
I guess that was enough for the school.
and that was it for RJ.
I hope he's got good friends out there.
cause none of us were much good for him in here.
I've got his shoes again.
you're not at the trail yet.
I know. And they're heading that way, but...
Sam, lines of force are supposed to go in the opposite direction of the track, correct?
Yeah.
well, these are going the same way.
doesn't make any sense.
unless he's wearing his shoes backwards, and bringing us on a goose chase.
ed, you want to follow the footprints back?
go plan, Sam. Let's go back 500 meters, if nothing we turn back.
Sam, bring the Hummer around and meet us.
good, deeper.
why are they going that way? The trail's the other way.
my boss... he's a really smart guy.
he can tell things about people.
he wanted me to ask you...your old man-- he hit you and RJ?
so you grew up around here, huh?
running around, hide-and-go- seek, that kind of thing?
okay, team, heads up, eyes sharp.
this kid's headed for a crash.
I never had a brother. Must be nice.
it kind of depends.
when he shoots your dad and gets the cops coming after him, not so much.
a lot of guys I know, same thing-- out of control.
they just needed a little guidance. They turned out okay.
yeah? - Yeah. Sure.
this one guy I knew, basic training-- loud, dumb, fat.
everybody says, this is the guy who ditches out in a week. We took bets and everything.
six months later, he was at the head of the grad parade.
wasn't a guy there who wouldn't follow him anywhere.
I spent a week on a mountainside with him.
he told me about his family.
believe me.
I figured,"man, if you can get through that, you can get through anything."
so he turned out okay?
Yeah. Sure he did.
somewhere you need to be, Simon?
shot fired.
anybody see the flash?
negative. - Negative.
what's happening? What are you doing?
if that was RJ, we're gonna find him with this.
please don't hurt him. Do not hurt him.
got it!
okay, team, shot signature's coming from quadrant 4 - c, that's 100 meters due east.
we're gonna do a pincer formation.
ed, Jules, wordy, you're Alpha, head northeast around 25 degrees, 100 meters.
you'll be in quadrant 4-B.
spike, Lewis-- Bravo, southeast 120 degrees, hit him from below.
alpha, we got a sig coming right at you.
okay, you're okay. You're okay. Can you tell me what happened?
I was running, and - and - and he had a gun, and I didn't have any money and he went to hit me and so I ran and then he shot at me.
Bravo team, you're almost on another sign, be careful.
hold up, hold up. - What?
you hear something?
lew, I'm on fire! I'm on fire! - Spike!
officer down! Officer down!
quad 4-c! We need assistance!
officer down! Officer down!
I'm fine. Thanks.
ammonium triiodide.
homemade explosive of every anarchist jackass and troublemaker.
kid hits me with Ammonium triiodide.
unbelievable.
I'm sorry, man. I should have seen him. I'm sorry.
bro, seriously, shut up.
but I will say, this one last time-- Romans and woods.
all I'm saying.
all right, I'm here.
according to the doc, the kid didn't just attack the cadet leader.
he attacked the cadet leader after he saw him grab another kid.
abused kids lash out.
but this looks like a kid who got used to lashing out to protect someone else, like a baby brother.
the path Simon marked for us was the exact opposite of where RJ was headed.
kid lied to us. I guess I was wrong.
I got a man down.
and I could care less about about this kid's psychodrama.
this game is over now.
I don't want you rushing back in angry, ED.
it's a little late for that, boss.
let me talk to the kid.
you know what? I appreciate the effort, Sam, but...this is their bond.
you're never gonna get brother to turn on brother. The kid's a lost lead.
no. I just didn't get it before. Let me try one more time.
you just gonna let him hang, like everybody else has?
you don't know anything about us.
I know this: Your brother's gonna get killed.
maybe that's what he wants.
is that what you want?
whether it was a...belt, or a cane, or sometimes just a fist...
RJ was always there, standing right in front of me, taking the worst of it every time.
he'd say,"what are you so scared of, huh? I'm still here, aren't I?"
how am I supposed to turn him in after that, huh?
I-I can't tur...
you'll be saving him by bringing him in.
or you're going to spend the rest of your life wondering what might have happened if you just tried.
look, I...I promise you this: Together, we can bring your brother back alive.
because so long as he's alive, there-there's hope, right?
Hey, I knew you'd come. Remember this place?
remember the summers we used to have here? - Yeah.
remember that? - Yeah. Sure.
you burned up that cop pretty bad, RJ. - Yeah. Okay, well...
he shouldn't have come after me then.
you know, that's what you get.
it's okay, man. It's me, buddy. What are you so scared of?
meth? Blowing up cops in the woods. I mean, who does this? Who are you now?
the same guy who was there for you every night... every time.
do you remember him?
Yeah. I just... that guy never scared me before.
I am... I'm just tired, simon. You know?
Yeah. I know, man.
I was up there, and, uh...
well, I was doing good. I was.
I started getting these nightmares, and I just figured if I stayed up, you know, I'd just... I'd be okay.
you know, I'd just get through the year.
come back to you. We'd get out of here. We'd be safe, you know?
RJ, no matter where we go, it'll still be us.
okay. Good. Okay, well, let's go then. Come on.
no, RJ, just listen.
remember that time dad lost his watch and he blamed me?
Yeah.
and he came at me at dinner, and he had that old belt.
you jumped in and you grabbed it, remember that?
Yeah, sure. Of course.
it hurt like hell. - Yeah.
and you grabbed it even though it almost ripped off your hand.
you wouldn't let go. - Yeah.
he was pulling on it, and he was going crazy, and mom was crying and I was crying, but you wouldn't let go.
okay.
I just want you to know, I'll never forget that.
Yeah, okay. - That you wouldn't let go.
I'm never going to let you go, either, RJ, no matter what happens. All right?
okay. Sure.
I don't know what you're talking about, man, but, uh, we should really get out of here.
no, no. No matter what happens.
what do you mean, man?
I just, I'm...
no way. - Rj... Rj...
no way. - Rj, just...
no way
no, RJ! RJ, no!
settle down, settle down. - RJ! RJ! No!
Hey, hey, I got him. I got him.
it's okay. - RJ!
let go of him! I'm sorry! - It's okay now. It's over.
get off of him! - I'm sorry!
I got you. It's okay, soldier. I got you.
excuse me.
Yeah, I'm sorry, sir. That's just, uh... that's not gonna happen.
and why is that exactly?
that's a good question.
here's a better question, sir.
who does the big-time lawyer call when he needs a big-time lawyer?
I've had just about enough of this.
haven't we all.
Lewis and Spike are out of the hospital. You seen sarge?
Yeah, he met up with a doctor.
they're gonna get that kid a psych evaluation.
they don't think he belongs in jail.
Where's Sam at?
Oh, had, um, he had some personal stuff.
we got a possible IED.
batteries, wire, pipe.
five...
confirming no visible identification.
four...
blocking remote detonators.
three...
going to try chemical detection. Burning nerve agents.
two...
this isn't good. - one.
fire in the hole.
4 hours earlier
I'm dying already.
want me to write you a note? Get you out of class?
could ya? Would ya, Officer Lane?
boss, what's the word?
they got a guy coming for the AC.
Alleluia. - Okay.
Oh, come on. - Nice.
okay, we're going to hit the briefing room and then we're going to patrol in air-conditioned comfort.
have I told you recently how much I really do love you?
Hello, boys. - Jules!
how do you manage to stay so fresh?
I think cool thoughts.
Kira, we're going to hit the streets.
team Two's going to hit Rexdale.
sergeant Rangford.
that's, uh, Mr. Rangford to you, sir.
Hey, don't call me sir. I work for a living.
how you doing, Daniel?
I'm doing fine. It's good to see you, Greg.
good to see you, too. You look good.
what are you doing out in the barn? A day like today you should be out hitting a golf course.
are you kidding me? You been out there?
you don't call. You don't write.
Eddie. How you doing?
fine. Fine.
so? How's Sophie and Clark?
they're good. They're all good, yeah.
spike. You still wear the rookie badge?
Nah-uh. This is, uh, Sam Braddock. He's new, but he's trying.
good to meet you, I'm Danny.
hot call, Team One, gear up.
what do we got?
suspicious package. Train station, south terminal.
babycakes, I'm coming! - Take it easy, Danny.
let's go!
Hey, Danny!
keep the peace, boys.
who called it in?
the security guard. He says the suitcase has been there almost an hour.
copy that.
we gotta keep that perimeter wide. We gotta keep it locked down.
Hey, who's that guy at the station?
Danny Rangford. Most decent, honest cop I've ever met in my life.
guy's a legend, retired about a year ago.
he's the guy that brought me into the SRU.
you? - Yeah. Him and Barney Fletcher, the two of 'em, they fought to have us trained in psychology and negotiation.
if it wasn't for them, we'd be straight-up SWAT.
so he was commander?
never made it past sergeant. Avoided promotion.
Why?
keeps you in the action.
thought maybe it was the booze.
you didn't smell it off him?
you new? - Three weeks.
uh, look, do you know if anyone's using the briefing room in the next little while?
Mmm, I don't think so. Team Three's gone off shift. Team One's out.
good. I just want to get a few things in order. Is it okay if I use the room?
go ahead.
I'm just gonna have a walkabout first. Is that okay?
strategic Response Unit.
okay.
morning, Sergeant.
inspector Stainton, what's the word?
we're not liking this. There's been a spike in terrorist chat last two weeks.
station sees over 200, 000 commuters a day.
I say that's "hotspot" written all over it.
Sam, north containment.
Lewis, west. Wordy, east.
spike, do your thing. Jules, second the boss.
stay connected. We're gonna need everyone's brain on this one.
let's get to know our friend.
Kira, can I trouble you a sec?
there's a, uh, file I've been meaning to look at.
a file?
Yeah, it's #5512.
you'll find it under Team Four, 1989.
okay. What's this in regard to?
uh, just getting a presentation together.
you know, old boys on the lecture circuit.
uh, it's probably not on a computer.
uh, look, if it's any trouble I can always go down to the archives myself.
Oh, no, no, no, it's no trouble. I just need to clear it with Commander Holleran.
uh, what do you need to do that for?
Oh, I just can't release files without permission. It's policy.
uh, well, well, it's not like it's a breech of, uh, anyone's privacy.
I-I mean, it was a case of my own. I was there.
sorry. Officially, you're a civilian now. So.
no. You don't need to do that.
look, the old days, one of us at the desk, you know
we'd have looked the other way.
well, I'm sure Commander Holleran...
you're not hearing me.
I didn't come this far.
stay quiet. - But I can just...
just stay quiet. And look down, hmm?
I need that file. Do you understand?
Yep.
let's go, darling.
10: 36 a. m.: suspicious suitcase.
constable Scarlatti initiating electronic counter measures.
I'll wait here. You go on and get the file. Fast is good.
wait. I'll take that.
sorry.
okay, know the subject, anticipate the weapon, target the solution.
what kind of person plants a bomb in a public place?
organized personality, not impulsive, not mentally incompetent.
emotionally detached, above average intelligence.
access to volatile material. And familiar with its use.
Yeah, and who wants to strike the city's transportation hub.
or just doesn't like tourists.
okay, everyone, eyes and ears open.
we may be dealing with an individual who likes to hang around and watch the carnage.
wasn't supposed to go this way, you know?
wasn't supposed to go this way.
could have just given it to me.
all I need to do was go in the briefing room, get a little work done, undisturbed.
I'll make sure you're not interrupted.
well, maybe you're not trained for this at your desk, but where I came from we're trained to profile people, and here's what I get from you: you're ambitious;
you're serious about your job; you don't want to be passive, be perceived as the victim.
so here's what you'll do: I walk into that briefing room, you'll sound the alarm first chance you get.
I try walking out of here, same problem.
man with a gun making unorthodox demands. You see my dilemmas? Smile.
Hey, Kira.
any word on the air conditioning?
tomorrow.
sergeant Rangford?
you hear I made sergeant? Team Three.
so you haunting the old barn? - Yeah.
sit down. Sit. Sit.
okay, confirming no visible identification.
Babycakes is sending out a signal blocking out remote detonators.
going to start with the infrared.
good news so far. Nothing unusual in the heat patterns.
going to try chemical detection for any nerve agents, blood agents.
sergeant.
inspector, anything good?
some of the people that reported the case said they smelled hay nearby.
so? Hay?
moist hay.
one woman said she smelled freshly cut grass.
Stainton, so what are you saying? That someone stuffed the case with hay?
boss. Hay and grass aren't the only things that smell like hay and grass.
those people that smelled hay and grass?
track them down, they gotta be put under medical observation immediately.
no physical exertion or it'll accelerate the spread.
spike, what do you think it is?
phosgene. It could be phosgene.
by the time you smell it, it's already at its lethal level.
you and Michelle finally gonna take that round-the-world trip she kept asking for?
well... maybe.
little hot in that?
Yeah.
you know what? No, I'm-I'm good. I'm good.
anything I can help you with there, Daniel?
I'm fine, Troy. I'm really fine.
I just want to be left alone, okay?
I don't think that's a good idea.
stand down!
stay back!
stay back! - Hey, sergeant?
keep it cool, guys. Everything's okay.
okay, Troy, you're going to keep your boys at a distance.
sure. Sure, Daniel.
you know how this works, boys.
Kira? Kira, did you try to transmit?
what's up, Jules? - I don't know.
this is not the way it was supposed to happen, you know.
never is, right? - No.
look at me. I'm the subject.
you don't have to be, Daniel. We can work this out.
sorry, Troy.
wait. She's sending something through.
team ONE HOT CALL...
Sarge.
IMMBDIATE
Kira? Kira, you copy?
Jules, you're in charge.
all right. - Lean on Stainton if you need to.
Eddie, we got a priority call.
I need you, Sam and Wordy to come with me.
Louis, you cover Spike.
Jules, let's get extra uniforms and detectives.
copy that. I'm on it.
ed, the priority call... it's at the station.
why don't you tell me what's...
don't... negotiate me.
now, go in here.
I'm gonna shut the door.
I'm barricading myself in. You understand what that means, don't you, Troy?
I do.
and you're gonna leave me to my own devices.
otherwise, the situation is going to get dangerous. You know that, right?
right.
I want you to consider me a threat level red.
you got that? - I got it, boss.
I'm gonna stop talking now.
threat level red. Can you say that for me?
threat level red.
that's good.
doing a good job, Troy.
it's Daniel Rangford. He's armed, and he's barricaded himself in the briefing room.
boss. - Talk.
he's got a Beretta, . 40 cal.
panels hold up to that?
Yeah, yeah, they're polycarb. - So, what's he doing in there?
he disabled a security camera.
he hasn't talked since he shut himself in there.
classified himself a threat level red.
negotiated me like I was a rookie.
are you surprised?
can your team cover the entrances?
Yeah, we're all we got, though.
most of my guys already clocked out.
Yeah, we're down three. The rest of us are dealing with the bomb threat.
you want me to call my guys back in?
Yes. - No.
boss, we keep this in the family. We can handle it.
okay, Eddie.
nobody gets in through the front. Garage access only.
I'm assuming he's closed the blinds, but we still need eyes in, so grab some range finders.
go outside and double-check. - Copy that.
Wordy, he's gonna be looking for the snake, so let's use the fiber cam.
got it.
Auto-transcriptor, boss?
we don't need it.
Jules has it anyway.
it could just be for us or... - Or what, Greg?
we could decide that when this thing is over, okay?
all right. Let's use Team Three's.
you set it up, but call his wife first. Her name is Michelle.
let's figure out what's been going on at home lately, okay?
on it. - Okay.
I want you to talk to him, okay?
none of us can stay objective, but you know him best.
Yeah.
all right, good. Kira, walk with me.
so, what do we know about phosgene?
it's not hard to make, and it's nasty.
could take 24 hours to show symptoms, so your victims don't even know they've been exposed until their lungs stop working.
okay, well, Stainton's on top of the med reports.
I'll tell him to alert his units for a potential chemical evac order.
maybe we need to block incoming trains as well. Anything else?
get him to broaden the perimeter, especially downwind.
got it.
okay, Babycakes. Let's take a look inside.
what's this I'm hearing about you being in there with a gun, huh?
telling Troy it's threat level red?
Danny, come on.
last time we talked, threat level red was code for "there's a wife in the station."
it's just me out here, Danny. It's Eddie.
Kira, what happened? He seemed fine when we left. I mean, how did he seem to you?
calm at first. Well, sweating a lot.
Yeah, well, we all are, right?
but steady eye contact, relaxed posture, chatty.
then, when I wouldn't get the file for him, he came off the rails like that wasn't the plan.
what do you think the plan was?
didn't add up: getting the file, preparing a presentation in the briefing room.
he wanted privacy.
think he wanted to leave the station with that file?
no, I don't think so.
and he didn't want Holleran alerted, right? - That's right.
remember anything about the file?
name in it was Gehring, 1989.
89, so there's no computer backup. Anything about that case?
just that it was his. Sorry.
no, no, you did everything right, Kira. Thank you.
you can go home. You're free to do that.
Hey, I'm not going anywhere. I'm a cop, too.
okay. Put on a vest and radio.
call Harvey Silver.
his name and number is on file. He was on Daniel's team.
they retired the same year. Tell him we need him here sooner than ASAP.
Eddie, how is our friend?
he's not talking.
I got eyes in.
fiber optic neutralized.
Troy, you got eyes outside?
he's moving. Looks like he's closing the shutters.
want to try the ball cam?
he's gonna be looking for that. Let's get thermals.
okay, I got it right here.
you sticky my fiber-optic camera?
nice job. What did you use, duct tape?
forgot how much you liked it low-tech.
remember that corner store barricade?
Danny, day like today, hotter than hell. You remember that?
you had me talk to those kids for an hour and half, Danny. Then, you came in.
turned up the heat. 20 minutes later, they came running out.
that was low-tech all the way.
thought you were on a bomb call, Ed.
we're on it. Just came back here to see what was going on.
I'm not here to negotiate you, Danny.
I just want to help you figure it out.
all you've done for me over the years. Come on.
go back to your bomb call.
Frank's on it, Danny. You know the bomb guys.
you know what's good for you, you stay out of there.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm gonna stay right here long as it takes.
Danny, what are you saying to me? How long?
about 14 more ounces.
11: 27 a. m. Barricaded subject, Daniel Rangford.
boss, how do you want me to characterize the subject?
barricaded. Leave it at that.
you talk to his wife?
Yes, I called her.
I told her her husband was at the station, and she got really upset; she hung up on me.
it's all you. - Boss, come and see this.
he's shooting at nothing. He's shooting at a chair. I got thermals.
on the ground.
on the ground!
Danny, our weapons are not raised. We are not here to hurt you.
down... down!
Danny, talk to me.
Danny, it's Greg Parker.
what's going on, buddy? What are you shooting at?
what's going on? - I don't know.
he's shooting at somebody who's not there.
is it hallucination?
Yeah, maybe flashbacks or something.
where is Daniel? I want to see him. Where is he?
what the hell is going on, guys?
no one through the front. - Ma'am, you cannot go in there.
Sam, Sam, it's okay. Michelle.
I want to see him. Where is he?
let's just walk over here for a second. - Where is he?
we can talk about it over here. Let's just walk over here.
I want to see him. You bastard, you bastard.
it's your fault. You do this to him, all of you. You bastard!
just calm down. It's okay. It's okay.
just go with Kira, and we'll find you a place to sit down, okay?
and I promise I will come to you as soon as I can, okay?
Michelle, let's sit down. It's gonna be okay.
boss. Take a look.
all right, that's enough. I'm gonna open it up.
he said he was gonna fire.
you want to spend the rest of your life thinking about what we shouldhave done, Wordy, huh?
Wordy, cover. Sam, we're opening up.
okay, boss. - Okay, go.
I told you not to come in!
let's slow this down, Danny.
close the damn door!
I'm not gonna be able to do that, Dan.
one step closer, we're done.
okay.
let the subject set the pace.
don't rush a negotiation.
cause I'm not finished here.
and I'm going to get this thing, right. Okay, Eddie?
okay.
back off.
boss?
I'll go talk to Michelle.
I think he's slowing up, so let's just keep him on his timetable, okay?
okay.
he's arriving now.
Harvey, I'm Sam, Team One.
where is he? I want to see him.
that's not gonna happen.
I got to talk to him. He'll listen to me.
Harvey, this isn't a good idea.
this is garbage. I can't just stand here.
Harvey, there's not a guy here who feels different, but we just need to streamline the inputs a little, okay?
ed Lane is with him now.
Eddie's with him? - Yeah.
okay. - Okay... good, we need your help.
we need you to rember everything you can about the Gehring incident in 1989.
this is not good.
we got a possible IED. Batteries, wire, pipe.
is that shrapnel?
it could be; it's not nails or ball bearings... some kind of small objects, though.
this thing could be on a timer.
it could be motion-sensitive, so we're not taking it anywhere.
we detonate it here in the square?
negative. Detonating will only release more gas.
we do a render-safe with the water cannon.
okay. We got to disrupt the mechanism.
and turn the phosgene into hydrochloric acid.
I promise you'll see him as soon as we know it's safe.
safe?
Michelle, we need to understand what he's doing, where he's coming from.
can you help us?
Yeah, of course I'll help.
thank you, 'cause, um...
cause you're the one who knows them best.
you think?
I know the guy I married. I remember him. This guy?
I mean, I was counting the days till he retired.
till he came back to us.
to me and Liam.
wake up to the world.
have a barbeque, put up his feet.
enjoy something.
didn't work out that way, huh?
no.
cause when he took off the uniform, it turns out there was nothing left underneath.
almost there.
all right, we've just got to get past the part of him that sticks to a plan.
so maybe we bypass the logic brain, force him to run out of there.
thinking about tear gas?
the animal instinct in the midbrain thinks it's Johnny run for air.
I don't recommend it.
Why's that, Danny?
you're going to have to evacuate the whole building for three days just to breathe in here.
three weeks with a sanitation crew.
we're not worried about making messes, Danny.
think it through, boys.
want to cripple the SRU?
all on the gamble that I didn't think of, uh, packing a gas mask in this bag?
does he let you touch him?
no, he doesn't.
and I don't mean just in bed.
I try to hold his hand, he pulls away.
the last time he touched me, I woke up with his hands around my neck and he was screaming at me.
he's been hanging off a cliff these years.
he won't talk to me.
not about work, he never has.
and he won't talk to you.
cause he knows.
you'll shake your heads,"Oh, so sad to see the great guy fall.
what happened to him? We thought he could hack it.
and you'll turn your backs so that you can keep on pretending that he's the exception.
Michelle, it's going to be okay. It's okay.
Danny. We are not playing chess here, now.
you're thinking about a permanent solution to a temporary problem.
I appreciate your faith, Ed, but...
right, then you've got to appreciate...
don't interrupt the subject! - Don't handbook me, Danny.
Danny, faith is what you need when there's no proof.
we don't need faith to know that you deserve to live.
Oh, yeah? That's something you can prove?
Yeah. Yeah, I think I can.
let's talk about all the people whose lives were made longer because of you.
don't start.
the Gehring incident. It was a home invasion.
Regent Park, but this little place was neat as a pin. You know who's keeping house?
little 18-year-old.
parents are both deadbeats; one's in jail; one's AWOL;
and she's holding it all together, looking after her little brother and sister.
what happened with the home invasion?
by the time we got on scene, the bad guys had gone.
the girl, she'd taken a whack at one of the guys with a baseball bat, scared him away.
so the team went back out on patrol, and Danny and I stayed behind to write it up.
that was it?
the little guy, ten years old, wanted to show us his baseball card collection.
I said,"No, we've got to go." And Danny says, "No. Let's stay.
he just bought a fresh pack for his own son, went out to the truck to get them.
we sat crossed-legs on the floor.
middle of the afternoon, summer day...
trading baseball cards with little guy...
it was good.
you remember this pretty clear for such a long time ago.
Yeah, well, you would.
two hours later, it wasn't our file anymore. It was Homicide's.
that little girl down by the dock. Remember her?
she was turning blue.
you could hardly breathe and you did mouth-to-mouth on her in the ambulance, all the way to the hospital. Buddy, you saved her life.
you stayed with her the whole time and then they called from the hospital.
to say,"Congratulations. She's gonna live."
Danny, you got the Silver Shield for that, buddy.
proudest freakin' nine seconds of my career.
cause then they give the punch line, which is something we don't tell the rookies, hmm?
about how the girl was brain-damaged from lack of oxygen.
Oh, yeah, she's going to live, like a vegetable, shriveling up until her family decides to pull the plug and put her out of her misery.
which I've got to say, seems to be a good idea right about now.
I know you're self-esteeming me like crazy here, but you know what?
that's the last thing I need right now. That's the last thing.
excuse me. - Okay, Danny. All right.
let's take a break.
he's almost at the bottom of that bottle.
the more we talk, the faster he drinks. Let's just...
take a little pressure off, okay?
boss, I'm not going to leave him.
all right, you stay. You stay, but let him do his thing.
okay. - I need to find out what's going on in that file.
okay.
we get the homicide file yet?
squad car's flying it over.
give you a deadline?
Yeah, what's left of his bottle of scotch.
Harvey, what do you remember?
two victims: older sister, younger boy.
perps got away.
tragic as hell, but it's nothing we don't see.
Yeah, but why did this one get to him? What was different about it?
did you ever talk to him about it?
I don't know. You know how it goes. I might've asked him how he was doing?
What'd he say?
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
inspector, we're getting ready to counter the package here.
no one comes close.
perimeter is locked up.
Thanks.
Danny, you thirsty at all in there?
Danny? A little water, buddy. I'm going to roll it in there, okay?
no surprises.
nice and easy.
incoming from Homicide.
Gehring, Jeremy, August 8, 1989.
august 8. - That's today.
find out why.
we got a witness tape.
all right, dig out a VCR. Let's get some answers.
Oh, you've got to be kidding me. It's Beta.
Oh, he's almost finished that bottle. I'm going to open it up.
are you sure?
Yeah, we need more access.
Sam, I need you. Troy, grab your guys.
we're going to open this up.
what's happening?
Michelle, I need you to stay out of range.
I won't hide in there anymore. He's my husband.
you know what? You're right. You're right. I want you to come with me.
I want you to hide behind the shields, and I want you to stay close.
all right, we ready? We ready? Sam.
Danny? Listen to me, man. it! Don't do it!
Danny, put the gun down!
Danny? Michelle's here!
what are you doing? You can't be here. Get out of here! You shouldn't be here!
I'm not going anywhere, Daniel.
get her out of here!
I'm not going anywhere!
don't make me do this in front of her!
Danny, just listen to me now.
get her out! Get her out of here!
Danny, put that gun down.
we're not leaving you, Danny! We're not leaving you!
go on!
in five, four, three... two, one.
fire in the hole.
hold fire. - Hold fire.
Daniel! Please!
Michelle, he's not going to hurt me.
he's not going to hurt me. Are you, Danny?
crossing the line. You think I won't do it?
cardinal rule. Gun's pointed at an officer.
sometimes you've got to break the rules, Danny, remember?
remember who taught me that?
I'll do it.
I'll do it. - I have the solution.
Wordy, damn it, go.
no, no. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
you know what you've got to do.
you've got to keep safe.
you ever seen this before? Do you have any idea?
no. No.
you're going to hide.
it starts here.
do what Jeremy told me to do.
he told me to stay under the bed.
so I didn't see them.
but you think they might have been the same men that had come before?
don't know why they came back.
cause he said we'd be okay.
who said you'd be okay, Petra?
the policeman with the baseball cards.
he, he said we'd be okay. Then he went away.
but he didn't know that they'd come back, Petra.
but maybe he did.
because, because he told Jeremy.
what do you mean, "He told Jeremy"?
he said,"You know what you've got to do."
you've got to be brave and show your sisters.
and so Jeremy wanted to be brave so he could save me and my sister.
but it didn't work. It didn't work.
boss, we got something. Home invaders came back.
boy stepped up to protect his sisters, Daniel and his team were done.
Daniel didn't do anything wrong.
it was something he told the boy.
Yeah,"You know what you gotta do? You gotta hide."
no, that's not what he said. He said,"You know what you gotta do?"
you gotta show your sisters you're brave.
what was the boy's name?
okay, thanks. - You hide like that.
shell, you got to go.
you can't see this.
Daniel, I'm not leaving you!
Daniel, let's talk about Jeremy.
the file you wanted.
I'm guessing it was about Jeremy, right?
cause today's the day. Isn't it? August 8?
it's funny those days that stick in our minds.
guessing that Jeremy was a pretty brave kid.
but I don't know that for sure.
could you, could you help me out with that one?
Danny, you can't do this.
you can't do this without...
without telling us why!
I know...
I know...
about a kid sitting on the floor.
I went back.
he didn't look any different from the last time we saw him.
his eyes were open.
he's looking at me, baseball cards spread around him, but he's real quiet.
he's real still and I'm thinking, "Why is he so still?"
Why? Why doesn't he say,'hi'?
then I see it.
he had a screwdriver buried into his throat.
and I put it there.
you didn't put it there, Danny. Criminals put it there.
if I hadn't been called there, I wouldn't have said that to him.
you got to be brave for your sisters.
if it wasn't me, he would've lived.
you don't know that, buddy.
I spent my whole career screwing up.
being too late, being too...
early, not saying the right words.
I spent my whole career looking at the worst 20 minutes of other people's lives and I can't take it anymore.
Danny, how about rembering the good stuff?
the good stuff-- all the lives you saved.
all the people whose lives were made better, the lives that were made longer because you were there for those 20 minutes.
I can't remember, you see? I can't remember! I can't remember!
all I see are the ghosts.
all I got are the ghosts. The ghosts.
I can't take it anymore.
please.
please help me.
pull the plug.
pull the plug. - Okay, wait.
No!
okay.
Danny, this isn't about Jeremy.
these guys think it's all about him, but it's more than that.
isn't it?
Jeremy's just...
who we always think about.
I get it.
I get it.
you know what, buddy?
every time...
every time I look at a damn scope, I see a kid run across.
I see a spray of blood.
you know what else, Danny?
you know what else I see?
all the calls we didn't get to in time.
the mothers that we couldn't talk down.
the kid who thought it'd be fun to pull a gun on a cop.
you're not the only one who sees ghosts, Danny.
I got to tell you, I don't know where to put them anymore either.
Eddie, please, no.
you taught me everything I know.
you made me who I am, Danny.
you can't... You can't tell me...
that this is how it ends.
you can't. Give me that gun.
it's gonna be okay.
stand down. Stand down.
it was harmless.
they just wanted to keep us busy.
silver
inspector Stainton, those witnesses are free to go.
hay and grass.
I'm going to take you to a place.
a place I've been myself.
and we're gonna get through this.
we're gonna get through this.
strategic
I thought we were gonna keep this one in the family.
Yeah, families and secrets, you know?
I don't think that's such a good thing.
I'm sorry.
eagle One, Eagle Two on the move.
was this on the itinerary?
sir, we got to move.
ed, she's not here.
what's going on? Where the hell is my wife?
Lewis, Wordy, get security to lock it all down. All exits, temporary red alert.
police! Strategic Response Unit! Anyone there?
police! Strategic Response Unit! Is anybody in there?
Oh, dear God, please. Just say yes. Say yes to however much they want.
they don't want money.
what do they want?
3 hours earlier
could you just try to be a little professional?
as you can no doubt surmise, Mr. Lane is primary on Eagle One.
Jules, you're going to need some plain clothes today.
questions?
school today? - No, I have work.
Ah, right. Your uniform's clean. It's hanging up.
may I help you?
no, it's Andres.
you must have the wrong... - Rafael Castillo.
we spoke on the telephone.
how was Dallas? - It was good.
saw the kid?
Oh, yeah, first time in eight years. - Nice.
tell Sophie I'm sorry, all right?
for what?
extra-long shift.
what? I thought tonight was your biannual date night.
she knows the drill; we've been married 15 years.
lots of time for date night when I'm old and feeble.
what, like me?
buddy, my understanding you have to have a, a date before you can blow off date night.
Oh, that. - I'm just saying.
you sold your car?
it cost, like, half a paycheck to fill up, which is the same price as a secondhand bike.
Ooh, watch out: Sam' s packing three speeds.
why not?
at work, it's all zero to 60, it's all madness and bad guys and go, go, go, hair on fire.
okay, I get it, so then going to work...
I take my time... take it slow... - Nice.
try to remember that people are generally nice.
so, uh, what about, uh, the ladies?
you know, picking 'em up, taking 'em out, night on the town.
you going to do all that on a bike?
excuse me.
you told me not to overpack.
I simply suggested we experiment in traveling light.
which is fine, except now you want me to wear the Dior tonight.
and guess what? It's at home.
you're going to look beautiful. Doesn't matter what you wear.
hell, wear the bathrobe.
sexiest thing a woman ever put on.
what do you think?
Oh, I agree. - See, Ed agrees.
liked him from the moment I met him. - Poor Ed.
sir, I'll double-check this stuff.
of course, whatever you need to do.
this is her traveling light.
and mineral water. Absolutely.
thank you, Ms. Gagnon.
Danny, 313, 314, I'm gonna take this one up myself.
Hey, boss.
Thanks, Jules. - No sugar.
1: 23 P.M. Knock on the door. Brace yourselves.
looks like room service.
what?
just haven't seen you in a suit before.
well, there's a first time for everything.
can we get a little focus going here?
uh, sweetheart?
no, you are not having the steak frites for lunch because we had steak last night for dinner.
thank you very much, my dear, perfect. - Thank you.
it's a nice choice.
my wife says the same thing.
a little omega-3 and the crossword if you want to live to be 70.
she's aiming for a hundred.
14 years she's been taking care of me, and ever since I met her, everything's better.
it's usually steamed, but it's still better.
I'm coming down for the package.
eagle One, Eagle Two on the move.
was this on the itinerary?
get the feeling this guy doesn't like itineraries.
check Eagle Two, it's on hers.
Yeah, but not for half an hour.
4: 00 P.M. interview with a journalist, library bar.
eagle One suggested they go down early for a glass of champagne.
Aw, what a guy.
all right, hold on. Hold the elevator. I'm on my way.
you got our team on all the exits?
we do.
3: 34 P.M. Eagle One breaks from itinerary, mark as unpredictable.
so what does your wife think of all of this?
all of what?
well, it's a dangerous job you do.
I mean, now, knock on wood, not tonight, but...
right, well, she's okay with it. - Really?
is she a police officer as well?
no, she's a caterer. This is Jules; she's with us.
spike, there's an unmarked exit just opposite the front desk.
staff only? - That's the one.
Sarge, I'm not liking the bar.
three exits-- one to the street, one to the lobby, one towards the kitchen.
corridors running east, west, up, down.
Yeah, we've closed off access to the street.
we're about to have Jules on the lobby door.
copy that. Be there in two.
okay, so the bar's a little soft.
what's the closest lobby exit?
South. - Wordy?
outside's clear. Heading in.
okay, just stay on it.
eagle One-- he likes to wander off-course.
I'll take the front exit when they get here, and I think we're good.
ready for anything.
we'll be gone by 8: 00. Our suite's already paid for.
why don't you bring your wife in for the night?
fridge full of champagne, room service.
lovely idea.
very kind, very kind, but I... - Can't take favors. I get it.
one of the ironies of having money -- everything costs less.
I'll get you my corporate rate. It's practically free.
sir, you know, you're very generous with the rest of the world.
I just wouldn't feel comfortable... - Ed, Ed, word to the wise.
don't try and fight him on this.
let me guess. You don't have enough time. Tough job, long hours.
you're great at what you do, Ed, but I got a few years on you. Trust me.
one thing money can't buy is enough time.
say yes. Call your wife.
it's a wonderful idea. Surprise her. Give her a call. Come on, go ahead.
okay. Okay.
I still remember the night you flew me to Santiago.
he said it was a surprise, told me to pack for two nights.
she packed for two weeks.
hotel balcony. He asked me to marry him.
he said he was leaving the mining industry behind.
I was working for the Foreign Service at the time.
we had known each other a whole entire month.
I will tell you what sold me on it.
he looked at me, and he said, "I'm finally gonna do something good with my life.
that's what he said. And he was holding out a ring. I mean, what was I gonna say?
is she not there?
no. No, she didn't, uh... She didn't answer.
okay. Mrs. Graham is waiting at her table.
thank you.
nice to meet you.
hello. I'll see you in the room, darling.
Yes. Please, sit, sit.
eyes on Two.
sir? - Go ahead.
Hey, did you just call?
uh, yeah. Yeah, I did.
do you know where that cheese shop is? You know the new one. It's got the, um...
cheese? - You should know. You ate it all.
anyway, I'm having Amy over tonight since you're working late.
well, that's too bad, 'cause I think I can get us a suite tonight.
you're working at the Royal York, right?
ed, we can't afford the Royal York.
think I can get us a deal.
you can't make it, you can't make it.
are you kidding? Room service.
date night alone with my husband.
champagne, fresh sheets. What time?
what about Amy?
Ah, she can eat someone else' s cheese.
Clark?
I'll get my mother to come over. 6: 00?
okay, yeah. I might be a little bit late, but, uh... - Jay?
you know, we're gonna finish things up here, and, uh, that should be good.
okay. I'll start the champagne and the bubble bath without you.
see you then. - See you then.
nice work. Jay, nice to see you again.
listen, I'm gonna need a suite for tonight at my corporate rate, but it's not for me.
of course. We've got a lovely suite available on the fourth floor.
we'll get it ready for you right now.
always happy to have a friend...
sir, we got to move.
stay here. I'll be right back.
explosion, kitchen oven. Get a medic in here. May have some injuries.
Oh, my God.
the woman and the journalist sitting at this table-- did anybody see them leave?
Jules, what's going on?
eagle Two. Ed, she's not here.
I'm gonna check the bathroom.
what do you mean, not here?
what's going on? Where the hell is my wife?
Hey, Spike, bomb truck. Figure out what happened.
Lewis, Wordy, get security to lock it all down.
all exits, temporary red alert.
Jules, channel two.
all right, Jules, talk to me.
I turned my head for three seconds, trying to figure out where to take her.
journalist is also missing. Possible subject.
I repeat, Team One, Eagle Two is MIA. I have no contact with her.
Stairwell's clear. Lobby's clear.
tell me what is going on.
sir, I'll keep you up to date.
you're telling me that my wife is missing, and you'll keep me up to date?
what the hell is happening here?
sir, please, I need you to stay calm.
and I need you to stay here.
it's got to be about money, right?
we'll get a ransom note in about a half an hour.
we don't know that.
well, I know that. - Sir, please.
cut off gas supply to this kitchen now and ventilate, fans, windows, everything-- before anything else blows.
let's see why this thing didn't take the roof off.
Hey, there's no sign of Eagle Two leaving the building.
as far as we can tell, she's...She's still within the perimeter. As far as the journalist...
he was fully accredited with the Millennium Forum.
unless he's a master of forgery, he writes for a small Chilean publication.
his name is Rafael Castillo.
excuse me. What are you saying?
I'm saying we may be looking at a kidnapping.
good news is, if so, she's being held within the building.
that's the good news?
Sarge, we got guys at every exit.
that's good. Cover Spike.
ask around, and just wait for my orders.
okay, let's break it down, do the math.
800 rooms, divided by five...
no. Excuse me. 809, actually.
it's 160 rooms per person.
Kira, get Rolie. We need Team Three here ASAP.
even if we cut these numbers in half, we're talking 80 rooms each.
no. Absolutely not.
we have 532 guests already checked in, 27 of whom are VIPs.
we cannot invade their privacy.
this is their home away from home. - Jay! Jay! Jay! Jay!
I've got one job. That's protect the principal.
principal's wife goes missing, that affects the principal.
see, you, on the other hand, have two jobs.
get my guys some master keys, and get a grip.
I don't know. I was on the phone.
I was talking to my mother, and then I heard that thing go off.
it's okay. It's okay. We're just... We're trying to make sure.
uh, did you see any strangers, any guests in the staff areas?
well, Claudia, if you hear anything, if you see anything, you come speak to one of us, all right?
uh, you said your shift's over at 5: 00. Is that right?
security's gonna show you out the staff door.
just show 'em your ID.
police! Strategic Response Unit! Anyone there?
security. Is there anyone in there?
police! Strategic Response Unit! Is anybody in there?
good. I'm glad I caught you. You haven't left yet.
Yeah, I know. I'm just getting ready. What do you need?
Soph, we can't do it tonight. I...
we're having a serious security problem here.
okay. Are you all right?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.
that's okay. I'll see you when you get home.
well, Ed, when I was still in mine, I took over a company in Venezuela.
hostile. Got very ugly, but, Ed, you don't become what I am by being nice to everyone.
but, I mean, this was all years ago.
well, let me ask you this. Could your wife be involved in something?
something that you don't know about?
I... I don't know.
I don't think so, but I suppose you never really know anyone completely.
Sarge, Ed, I don't like it.
I got wires. I got a fuse. Explosives 101, nothing fancy.
you could learn this stuff in high school.
but it's a bomb. It's definitely a bomb.
wasn't built to kill, but it sure was a hell of a distraction.
do you know why you're here?
no. Money, I guess. I don't know.
three men who were loved by their families.
tell her. Tell her!
my father-- his name was Gabriel Alvarez.
we lived in Falpago, Chile.
the last time I saw him, he was standing on our doorway.
he was making my mother laugh, even as she was crying.
he was fighting for our village, to make things right.
but it didn't work. They took him away.
they humiliated him. They tortured him.
he disappeared.
I never knew what happened to him.
I'm sorry. I am. But...
I don't understand what this has to do with me.
don't! She can't bring them back.
I'll explain how it works.
Sarge? This freight elevator hasn't moved in 20 minutes.
it's worth a shot.
Jules, we've got a frozen cargo elevator in the east wing.
might be worth a look.
send Lewis, too. - Copy that.
Sarge, she's here. We got her.
but we've got a problem.
please stand back. Stand back. - Okay.
they called it a necklace bomb.
civilians coming through. Let them out. That's the last of them.
no, sir, no, sir, Inspector.
they told her, anyone tampers with it, anyone tries to isolate her, get her out of the building, they trigger the blasting cap and sever her spine.
I don't know, I... I don't know.
they also told her it was fitted out with a camera.
we can't take that chance.
boss, this's it. Everyone's out. The floor's secure.
three different triggers.
mercury switch, pressure fit, and a remote.
now, if we can disable the remote, we can deal with everything else.
and sir, if you've got any ideas...
all right, we'll see you in a bit. Thank you.
where is she?
she's safe. She's doing well, but we need you to stay back.
if you are gonna be down here, you're here to help us, and you need to stay back until further notice, sir.
do you understand me? - Yes.
okay, come on, Eddie. - Wordy.
we'll be back. - Sir.
spike says he can't cut it until he knows what's triggering it.
Plus, they told her there's a camera.
they'd hit play if anyone tries to cut it.
we got to get them in bomb gear. - I know. They both said no.
you're gonna be fine.
we're all here with you, okay? - Okay.
guys, I need ten seconds of complete silence, okay?
if she's safe, I don't understand why I can't go in.
sir, it's for your own safety.
how is she a threat?
it's not her, sir.
they've got her in a necklace bomb.
Oh, my God.
you've heard of these things?
I lived in South America for eight years. Yes, I've heard of them.
Oh, dear God, please. Just say yes. Say yes to however much they want.
they don't want money.
what do they want?
you didn't see her? You didn't see the woman who spoke?
no. By then, I was blindfolded, so apart from the journalist...
there was nobody else in there?
I don't know. Castillo was the one who gave me the instructions.
can you give them to me again?
I am to go to the opening address at 7: 00.
I don't even know what time it is now.
no alarms, no changes, no alerting the other guests.
you can't be serious. That's 20 minutes from now.
in front of the room, in front of everyone, my husband is to confess.
confess to what?
to something about his mining operations.
something about a man named Gabriel Alvarez.
if you tell the truth, your wife will live.
now, that's what they told her.
any of this make any sense to you?
let me see her.
okay, go. Quickly. - Okay.
I love you.
this is too much. - No, it's too late.
there's no time to debate this, Claudia.
you cannot back out on us now.
the world needs to know what this man did.
so, I give this to Felipe in the room...
and then I can go, right?
unless I don't make it in.
why wouldn't you?
security is going to be very tight.
listen, if I don't make it in, and if Graham lies to us, to the room, you press...this button. Okay?
but, Claudia, if the man apologizes to us, to everyone, nothing happens.
we let her go.
you promise? - Of course.
okay.
thank you. Claudia, your father...
this... this is what he would do.
does it have a camera?
I can't tell until we pull it apart.
is she safe to walk around?
I need a minute to develop the X-ray, but as far as I can tell, there's no embedded motion sensor, no timing device.
so, it needs to be triggered? - Yeah.
found a small amount of TNT, and there's a blasting cap attached to a relay switch.
could be set off by cell phone, could be set off by shortwave remote.
okay, meaning?
meaning, they're either gonna call it in or they're gonna be within the line of sight.
probably within 30 feet.
what about the people around her?
it's a blasting cap. It goes off, it breaks her neck.
she's done, but it's not gonna hurt anybody else within five, ten feet, I'm guessing.
okay, we'll put her up in the balcony.
meets the demands, but keeps her out of the way.
that's the best we can do right now. Let me know.
all right.
there is no guests or staff members with the last name Alvarez.
and beyond Graham giving a public confession during his keynote speech in front of the press, in front of the world, we don't know what these people want or who they are.
what the hell did this guy do?
his past life, in his sleep-- I don't care.
the wife doesn't even know, sir.
they told her that he would understand what it was about.
no, we can't risk it.
60 people having drinks, and we're gonna put a woman in the middle of that?
we keep her up in the balcony, out of the way.
having her in the room is part of the demand.
I don't care.
this guy says one wrong word, we've got a woman being executed at a public function.
sir, either way, they're gonna kill her.
they're not asking for money or hostages or concessions, which means it's like war, right?
they're making a point. They're making it publicly, and they want him to see what happens to his wife...
not if we stop it.
we've got 14 minutes. We don't have time to do anything else.
all right. - Go, Sam.
we follow their instructions to the letter.
eagle One and Eagle Two go into the party.
eagle One does his thing, as instructed.
in the meantime...Spike is working on electronic countermeasures, jamming all cell phone signals within a 100-meter radius.
no calls in, no calls out.
don't tell me this thing can be set off by a cell phone.
not anymore.
the only other possible trigger is shortwave remote, like a pager.
what does that mean?
that the subject has to be within the line of sight, 30 feet from Eagle Two.
we contain the room. Sam prepares a less lethal solution because, if the weapon is a garage door opener, we can't take that chance.
we cannot shoot to kill.
we contain the room; the subject's already arrested.
all right, Greg.
I'd like to talk to my husband, please.
sweetheart.
this isn't happening, okay?
it's just another night.
it's just me and you.
you get up there and you tell the truth, and we go home together.
David... please.
you can't get up there and lie.
you can't try and save me by confessing to something you didn't do, 'cause what you have built, what we've built together, if we let them destroy it like this, it will never end.
I'll see you in there?
Yes. I will see you in there.
I lo you.
with all my heart.
sierra One in position.
copy that.
we're on our way. - Copy.
okay. Let's keep the peace.
boss, what did this guy do?
I don't know.
eagle One approaching.
got to be something I can do, uh, somebody I can pay.
just buy us a little time to do our job.
longer you talk, the better. Left here, sir.
ladies and gentlemen, I'm Jane Renn.
I'm with the Millennium Forum.
I'd like to welcome you tonight, and thank you for braving the increased security this evening.
it's my pleasure to invite tonight's speaker to join us: David Graham.
he needs no introduction.
thank you very much.
eagle Two, we're in position.
copy that.
I...don't know what to say.
honored tonight in this way, I wish I deserved it. I do. I wish that more than anything.
the nonprofit work we've done in South America is the work I'm most proud of.
Jules, any sign of the journalist? - Negative.
it all began, of course, as an idea of Catherine's.
everything does-- everything good.
15 years ago, we sat on a balcony in Santiago, and I promised Catherine I would do something good with my life, if only she would just stay with me.
Magically... she agreed.
and since that night, I've never looked back.
because if I did, if I did...look back, I would see things I can't believe I let happen.
I would see ghosts. Faces.
Gabriel Alvarez mounted a citizen's blockade， My copper mine in Huaron, a very effective and very expensive blockade.
her shift is over.
that waitress, her shift is done at 5: 00.
copy that.
quadrant Three, possible subject, waitress, black hair.
I was approached.
I said "Yes," take care of him.
two days later, the blockade was gone, and I didn't ask any questions.
I said "Yes."
yes is the easiest word.
Yes, I love you.
Yes, I will marry you.
Yes, get rid of the problem.
what you don't know is that saying yes stays with you forever.
the violence you do. These choices.
quadrant Three, male black suit approaching possible subject.
I am sorry. I am...so sorry.
no, no, no! - Sam, tell me you got the solution.
I've got it.
go, go, go, go.
now? Dead. Definitely dead.
okay, can we keep cell signals blocked until we get this thing is off?
done.
mezzanine clear? - Mezzanine clear.
Jules, up in the mezzanine, Spike's gonna meet you up there.
copy that.
I don't think so.
okay, it's time. - Okay.
okay...
okay.
all right? - Yep.
you're going to take this thing off? - That's right.
Where's your gear? - It's all right here.
no, I mean don't you have a protective suit or something?
no, I don't need one. - Please.
we're going to be just fine.
okay. - Okay.
boss, we got the journalist.
he tried to exit the staff door. One of the uniforms recognized him.
I should have told her.
I'm not here to judge.
I was trying to protect her.
so were we.
thank you. - You're welcome.
thank you.
thank you. Thank you so much. - Okay.
thank you.
excuse me, Mrs. Graham? - Yes.
go ahead. State your name and address.
my name is Claudia Andres.
I live at 267 Cressyoad, in North York.
I am a waitress in this hotel.
I'm really sorry about what happened tonight.
Mrs. Graham, can you identify this woman?
her face, her voice?
Yes. Yes, I can.
she served us lunch today.
okay, thank you.
Wordy, let's bring her to the VIP guys.
get her processed as a possible accessory.
copy that.
Catherine, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. - Don't you...don't you apologize!
sir, they're going to need a few minutes to debrief.
right, of course.
I got to go. - Okay.
thank you. - Yeah.
thank you.
8: 27 P.M. incident contained.
two arrests. VIP secured.
that was a long day.
if it's okay with you, all right, debrief tomorrow.
Yeah.
good job, everybody. Good job.
come on. I'll buy you a drink.
date night.
all right. See you tomorrow. - All right.
Hey, Jules!
Hey, it wasn't your fault. - Yeah, I know.
so, why are you leaving? We got the truck. I'll take you back.
can you just take it back to HQ?
I'm really close to my house. I just want to walk.
fine, I'll drive you home. - Sam!
what? - Okay, stop, all right?
I don't need you to be nice to me right now.
I don't need you to rescue me or be the big hero.
I just...I need a minute alone.
you think I feel sorry for you?
that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Let's go.
Jules, I'm driving you home.
I promise you don't even need to talk.
no, I just...
what are you doing?
date night. It's a good book.
you mad? - No.
sure? - I'm sure.
so, did you save anybody today?
kinda did. Yeah.
if you want to get out of here alive, then you're going to tell me what happened in New York.
spike, what's going on? I need eyes in. Get up there with Jules.
what do you want me to say?
I will know the truth when I hear it.
alpha One and Two, requesting permission to enter, sir.
we go through the skylight, we'll spook her. She might use the knife.
what have I done? What have I done?
boss, I can see this. You're not seeing it. Sam' s not seeing it.
I can see it. We can be in there within three seconds.
we'll disarm her. The knife is down. Repeat: the knife is down.
we got to go in, boss. We got to risk it.
3 hours earlier
last month, we sat here in this same spot, and I told you that your chances were very, very slim, and that I did not think that you should go forward with another treatment.
I'm sorry to be so blunt, but in good conscience,
I can't recommend that you spend another $15, 000.
okay, all clear.
not that I don't appreciate a little excitement, but come on, I think we're safe.
you mind if I don't gamble my career on what you think?
unless one of your neighbors works for the SRU, it's not much of a gamble.
now, headquarters, that's another story.
I trust you have an entry plan.
affirmative. I'm gonna drop you off a few blocks away, park my vehicle at HQ, enter through the front.
you're gonna wait a few minutes, stealth through the rear.
I was kidding. - Yeah, I'm not.
Sarah, when you get home, can you see if I left my phone on the counter?
we're not giving up, right? We're not...
Oh, for God's sake, Sarah, we...
we're not doing it again. - Why?
we're not doing it again. I'm sorry.
I-I can't get back on this roller coaster.
I can't keep feeling like every month is some sort of test that we have to pass...
you know that's not true.
what else do you want to throw away, hmm?
I mean, what else gets thrown out the window just in case maybe this time we're lucky.
what are you talking about, Josh?
everything that we save, sweetheart.
everything, everything that we hoped for.
you're the one giving up on our hope.
you threw away your work...which you were damn good at.
and we agreed. We made that decision together.
okay. - We agreed that that was the right thing to do.
because you wanted to relax.
you wanted to relax and read catalogs and dream of babies in a house that we can't pay for anymore.
I never said I wanted that house. I don't need a big house.
we'll move. We'll get a smaller house.
all our friends who have babies you don't want to see anymore.
that's not true.
you can't go outside because you're scared you're gonna see another frickin's stroller.
I went outside yesterday.
y-you went outside yesterday? - Yes.
I've held your hand...
I've stayed up with you at night. I've dreamed with you.
I've given up a lot that I care about.
I mean, I've done... everything that I can do, but I-I...
I-I can't do this anymore.
you can't do what?
you know what? I-I should... I'm gonna go to work. I have to go to work.
what are you saying? - I have to go.
Josh! G... Josh.
what are you saying?
she keeps putting my pants in the dryer.
hold up. Hold up. Your mom still does your laundry?
Hey, she's Italian, okay? Try and stop her.
gentlemen.
missed you at choir practice last night, man.
that's another round you owe the boys. Don't let that add up.
you know what? I lay down for 20 minutes, I opened my eyes, suddenly it was 6: 00 a. m.
I hate when that happens.
Sam tastes sleeping alone.
what's this world coming to?
ed, we patrolling today?
all right, listen up. The El Colera gang has three strongholds.
we are gonna split up and cover 'em all.
boss wants us out in five, so let's go, ladies.
Oh, he's not home! He's not home!
Oh, no. No.
so, you want to cook tonight? Try your new barbecue?
relax. We're off.
how did it go with the guys this morning? - Fine. Don't worry.
anyway, who cares what we do?
uh, the sarge, the chief, the commander. The rules.
all right, but the thing is... - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
it's nobody's business. We're professionals.
Absolutely. You are utterly professional.
me, I'm just here for the sexy sniper chicks.
you doing okay?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good. I'm good.
cause, uh, the other day at the station...
Oh, come on. Here we go.
what? - Look, I'm just saying.
you look through the scope, and you see things that aren't there.
maybe you need a break from the action.
when was the last time you had a day off?
I don't need a day off.
Hey, we could all use a day off, Ed.
all right, thanks, Oprah. I forgot what a joy it was to ride with you.
hello.
Mrs. Scott? - You must be Hannah.
I'm, um... I write for... Wired Magazine. I'm here to see Joshua?
of course. Come in.
if this is a-a bad time, I could... - No. No, it's a good time.
please, come in. Sit down.
you have a lovely home.
thank you.
would you, uh... Would you like some tea?
sure. Thank you.
he's, um... He's at work a-actually.
I'm sorry. I thought he was here.
I-I wanted to talk to you.
I'm s... You texted me?
I want to know about you and-and him.
how do you mean?
I think you know what I mean.
do you know what? I'm gonna go. I'm sorry that I... that I bothered you.
please don't. - Excuse me.
I-I have to... - Don't go.
you let me go! - Not until you tell me the truth.
look, I just... I just want... I just want the truth.
okay.
so you stay until we talk. Okay?
all right. Okay, we can talk.
I'm calling the police! - Don't. No, don't!
put it down! Just stay... Just stay away from me.
no. No, don't do that.
Oh, my God. Help me. - Put that down!
team One, gear up. Hot call.
possible home invasion, 16 Lake rock Crescent.
we're real close. Boss?
Kira, what did 54 Division give us?
911 came in ten minutes ago. Dispatch flagged it.
there's been a wave of violent home invasions in the neighborhood.
underground Boys?
same grid. Copy that.
underground Boys?
four in the last two weeks, and all four came through the basement windows.
last week, they found some woman at home, tied her up and robbed the place.
Kira, play the 911, would you?
here it comes.
Oh, my God! Help me, please! Help me, please! Help!
put that down!
how far are you guys?
three minutes.
okay, don't approach without cover. They could be expecting us.
get some intel. Hold off on entry until we go in as a team.
got it.
no signs of forced entry on black or white wall.
okay. No broken basement windows?
that's a negative.
maybe the Underground Boys are trying a new MO.
could be something else. Who knows?
Sarah and Josh Scott. She's an illustrator. Works from home.
he runs a software design company.
neighbor saw them leave together early this morning, but she returned home alone around 9: 15.
that doesn't sound like a domestic, does it?
unless the guy came back and walked in on the wife doing something she didn't want him to see.
or she opened the door to the intruders herself.
Sam, let's move forward on this.
make contact, but go careful.
Yes, sir.
Jules, I'm dialing in.
Kira, can you patch me through to the source of the 911?
come on.
this is Sam Braddock from the Police Strategic Response Unit.
we're here to resolve the situation, but we can't help unless you pick up the phone.
we got movement on white Alpha Two.
throw phone?
okay, team, it's not a domestic.
the husband was at work, and he's on his way.
boss, we're thinking about a throw phone.
if they pick it up, it will limit their movements.
if they don't, we'll have the open mike on our side.
all right, copy that.
here's something weird. I just talked to the alarm company.
the alarm hasn't been triggered today, and it was armed a few minutes ago.
so, what, the intruders come in and then she sets the alarm?
how does that work?
if someone's pointing a gun at you and they tell you to punch in the code, you'd do it.
how far are we?
two minutes out.
please step away from your window.
we are throwing a phone into the house.
the window's going to break.
what the hell was that?
please, please answer!
please talk to them! - Shut up!
shut up! You don't get to tell me what to do!
don't tell me what to do!
this is Sam Braddock from the Police Strategic Response Unit.
get away from my house!
this is Sarah?
get down and stay down! Stay down!
don't... don't move! - Okay!
I just... I-I just want the truth!
Sarah! - Don't!
just tell me the truth!
Sarge, we lost the ear. She threw the phone out. It's escalating.
okay, we have a hostage situation with an unknown weapon.
talk is number one.
but be ready with an immediate action if the hostage is threatened.
spike, you're less lethal. Jules, you're Sierra One.
let's set up the LADD. Number one on white, number two on black.
at least we can keep listening.
copy that.
Sam, I want you to say on the loudhailer.
be persistent with no pressure.
you're not taking over?
negative. - Copy that.
Sarah, I'd really like to know...
I don't know what you're talking about.
I need to make sure everyone's okay in there, Sarah.
ed, I'm gonna run tactics.
you and Lou run Command Post.
Wha... Command Post?
oprah says.
Yes, sir.
let's get a list of all the license plates parked nearby.
what? - You... in the truck.
what can I tell you?
it's backwards day.
let me through. Get out of my way. - Sir...
get out of my way. My wife's in there. Let me through.
Sarah! Let go of me!
joshua Scott. Mr. Scott.
thank you, Constable.
what are you doing?
we can't let you come any closer.
my wife is in there. She's in danger. What are you doing?
sir, we're not sure it was your wife that placed the 911 call.
what do you mean?
we believe your wife is holding someone in there against their will.
no, Sarah would never do that.
sir, are there any firearms in the house?
no, there's no firearms in the house.
stand back, sir, please.
team, husband claims there are no guns in the house.
we might be looking at a knife, scissors, razor blade.
look, she would just never do that.
sir, I can't have you do that. You need to step back. - Okay, okay.
now I need you to help me.
I need you to help me with some answers, okay?
what can you tell me about her state of mind this morning?
she was upset. We had a fight, an argument.
your wife is there with an unknown weapon and a hostage, and we don't want to make her more upset, okay?
I don't think it's a good idea if she sees you through the window right now.
okay. - You got to trust me on this. This is what we do.
okay.
okay, I want you to come into the truck over here. Talk to my guys, tell 'em what you know.
unknown weapon.
Sarah Scott.
unidentified hostage.
sergeant Parker to direct tactical plan.
how you doing? I'm Ed Lane. Louis Young.
have a seat, please, Josh.
you texted him twice this morning.
it's professional. I told you.
you're lying.
what about "Yesterday was amazing"?
any movement?
no, but I definitely scared them away from the windows.
a little aggressive, huh?
you're doing good.
okay.
move as soon as we got a position on 'em.
copy.
Gordy, we got ears yet?
getting an audio signal.
please! - Tell me the truth!
if we could just go outside, please?
you can just talk to your husband.
please, let me talk to my wife.
Josh, we can't right now. We can't.
spike's on Less Lethal.
boss gonna need you with the gas.
what do you mean,"lethal"?
Josh, Plan A is less lethal.
less lethal?
rubber bullets.
how can you be less dead?
we dislodge the weapon, restrain the subject.
this is insane.
you have all this hardware for an upset woman with maybe a knife.
knife's as bad as a gun.
it never sticks, never jams, never runs out of ammo and you don't need training to know how to use it.
so just sit down and calm yourself.
please, please, I'm so scared! Please?
I've got eyes. Female hostage. Knife confirmed. Threat imminent.
spike, stand by. - Copy.
on my go.
please don't hurt me! I'm pregnant!
she's pregnant. Hostage is pregnant.
stand down! Stand down. Stand down. We got a pregnant hostage.
you...you're having his baby?
no.
you're having his baby.
your having his...
I knew it. I knew that there was a reason that, that...why he'd given up. It was you.
please, you're not making sense.
you're coming with me.
please, you need to talk to someone. - Get up!
okay, team, new rules: No Taser, no CS gas and no rubber bullets.
not a lot of tools in the toolkit.
Gordy, we hear anything yet?
Yeah, it's not clear.
please! Please!
go up the stairs.
they're wrestling. - Spike?
I've lost them. I've lost visual.
boss, let me send in some gas, clear them out.
negative. She's pregnant.
we got to go in, boss. We got to risk it.
No!
enough!
please watch out for the baby!
enough!
enough, enough. Enough. Enough.
please, please don't hurt the baby.
thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
come on. Let's go. Upstairs.
I need to show you something.
so you have no idea who this woman is?
no.
your wife thinks you're having an affair with her, Josh.
I am, I am not having an affair.
you understand the risk you're taking if you lie to me?
I love my wife.
we had a tough time, but I love my wife.
I understand that, but what I don't understand is who she has in that room with her and why she has a knife to her throat.
Mr. Scott, we need you to draw a floor plan of your house.
both floors, Josh.
every door-- which way it opens and every window.
okay. - Thank you.
Eddie, Eddie, what's he saying?
that he's not involved with anyone.
you believe him? - No.
okay, she says she wants the truth, and so do I.
he was saying they were having a fight this morning, talking about having a baby.
let's see how that escalated before this knife starts swinging again.
Lou, I want you to patch me in on this conversation.
I want Sam and I to hear it.
copy that.
Sarah, it's Sam.
I'm trying to phone again. Please pick up.
did he tell you about this?
what?
about the eight years?
I don't know. I don't know what you're saying.
shut up! Over there. Get over there.
sit down!
I interviewed him for the conference in New York for Wired Magazine.
we had tea.
that's what I meant by "yesterday was amazing."
you're lying. - The interview... The interview was amazing.
Sarah, I need you to come to the phone so we can talk about your safety.
what did you just do? - Nothing.
what did you just do? - Nothing.
we've been trying to have a baby for eight years.
eight years of hormone shots, IVF treatments.
we took out loans. We drained the accounts.
it looks like we can afford it, right?
but we couldn't.
a year ago we get pregnant, finally.
but we didn't want to tell anyone because we wanted to be sure.
so we waited-- one month, two months, three...
at four months, we made this...we made this room for the baby.
we let ourselves believe.
we told everyone.
and we lost it.
How' d she handle it?
she fought back. She's a fighter.
I didn't want to give up.
for him.
he should be a father.
is she delusional? Mentally unstable?
no. No, I mean she...she was depressed for a while, but she's not deluded.
then tell me why she thinks you're having an affair with a total stranger, Josh?
boss, we're picking up some kind of audio signal.
what kind of audio signal?
from the house, intercom maybe.
patch it in.
Josh, you guys have an intercom at your house? - No.
walkie-talkies, anything? We're picking up voices here.
I mean, we have a baby monitor, but it wouldn't be on.
where?
in the nursery. - What floor?
it's on the second floor, front of the house.
can you get it any clearer, Lou?
I'm working on it.
okay, team, we know we're not welcome here, so let's go stealth, low and slow.
spike and Wordy, I want you on entry with me. Jules.
my cousin has a baby monitor.
it's a two-way, so the kid can hear the parents. It's worth a try.
okay, try to tap into that frequency.
Sam, she's not going to answer that phone.
we'll try this way in.
Jules, I want you to find a scorpio position on the roof.
I think I saw a skylight up there. That' ll be Plan B.
and bring a camera pole.
I just need to get through this without you trying something again. Okay?
okay, we got ears, and we're good to talk anytime you say, Sam.
channel 4.
good work, Lou. I'm gonna need you on entry with me, and get the husband's keys.
if you want to get out of here alive, then you're going to tell me what happened in New York.
you're going to tell me why you were there with him.
what happened after tea?
nothing.
what was so amazing then, hmm?
what do you want me to say?
huh, what do you want?
I lose either way, right?
what kind of answer do you expect when you wave a knife in someone's face?
I will know the truth when I hear it.
you're not going to like the truth.
go, Kira.
license plates coming at you.
all right, let's see what we got.
Josh, you recognize any of these?
Oh, my God.
she rented a car that's parked down the street. You know her?
she's a reporter from New York.
how do you know her?
why would she... I haven't seen her since...
since when, Josh, since when?
are you telling me that you had a thing with this woman?
we got to know, buddy, 'cause if you did, that changes everything.
I did.
I've known Josh for 18 years.
before Sarah, we were friends, really close, but never more than friends.
from the first moment we met, we had a connection, you know, like...a really strong connection like...the ones you can't really explain.
and we lost touch, and then one day, I'm in New York in a conference, and we bump into each other and sh...
she asked me if she could interview me.
then I'm talking to him face to face after all these years, and it's like no time has passed.
Sarah and I were in this really bad place.
I mean, I don't want blame it on fertility treatments, but...
he said somewhere in there it was like you two stopped having anything to say to each other.
every conversation was about: when's the next doctor's appointment, what are the odds, how, how are we going to afford to pay for the next treatment?
and, you know, I-I don't want to sound like I'm making excuses.
I-I don't want to make ex... oh, my God.
Josh was still Josh, but he'd changed.
I could see that.
he was sadder, like the life had gone out of him. like...like he'd forgotten how to laugh.
and you, you laughed.
afterwards, I'm lying next to her, and all I can think about is Sarah, and I'm thinking to myself, "What have I done"?
spike, what's going on? I need eyes in.
Barricaded?
Sarah saw my father through three rounds of chemo.
you know, she was there in the hospital with me when my father died.
Oh, my God.
that one night was the biggest mistake of my life.
it was the night that was always meant to be. It was just 15 years late.
that night...
Oh, my God, he came alive again.
all right, I'm in position.
no joy yet-- I'm going to try the camera pole.
spike, get up there with Jules.
Sam, Sam, this is our last chance.
unless you got something to go on, I got to send Jules in on an explosive entry.
no, hold on the entry. Patch me into the room. Let me give it a shot.
I couldn't tell Sarah, I just... I couldn't.
you know, and when I got back, when I got back, every time I looked at her, I just...I loved her more, and I was so scared that I was going to lose her, you know, and that just, that just changed everything.
it changed everything.
what have I done? What have I done?
Josh, you told us the truth.
you did the right thing.
Yeah.
it's on channel 4.
the baby... - Yeah.
is Josh the father?
Sarah? It's Sam, Sarah.
we were able to open a frequency on that monitor in your room.
they're talking about sending a team in there.
I don't want to send anyone in. I want you to come out, Sarah.
Oh, God...
it's you.
that's why he gave up so easily.
Cause...he wants to be with you. And the baby.
Sarah, please, I need you to listen to me.
you know what he promised me?
he promised me...no matter what, through thick and thin, we'd be together.
is that what she's saying?
that's what she's saying?
and I don't think any of that's changed, Sarah.
no, no, no.
no, because when he got back from New York, he was changed.
he was different.
like he was trying too hard.
when the doctor told us to stop trying, I couldn't stop crying.
he didn't cry. Not once.
tell her I did. I... I just... it was just...just never in front of her, 'cause I wanted to be strong for her, I wanted...I wanted to be strong for...
look, just t-tell her I'm here. Tell her that I... that I love her.
t-tell her about the Bridge of Sighs.
tell her about the Bridge of Sighs.
boss, you get that entry option lined up, you've got to go for it.
no, Ed, hold it.
give the husband a headset.
Mr. Scott?
this is Sam Braddock; I'm the guy talking to your wife.
tell me about the Bridge of Sighs.
I got eyes.
tell me.
knife is pointed down.
what's the subject's state?
she's crying, distracted. Boss, threat is low. I can do this. I can see access.
alpha One and Two, requesting permission to enter, sir.
we go through the skylight, we'll spook her.
she might use the knife.
sir, she does not want to use that knife.
do you know that?
this isn't aggression anymore. This is grief.
she's almost done. She just wants the truth.
boss, I can see this. You're not seeing it. Sam's not seeing it. I can see it.
we can be in there within three seconds. We'll disarm her.
the knife is down. Repeat: the knife is down.
the truth is the only thing she's been asking for, her one demand, and she's not getting it.
okay. Okay, the knife is still in her hand.
constable Braddock will continue with negotiation.
do you know what?
I'm really not that great with words, but...but I've been talking to a guy who is.
and he's been telling me a lot about you.
about how he made a big mistake, about how much he loves you...
that's not true!
and he wanted me to tell you...about the Bridge of Sighs.
when my father died...
and when his father died and he'd lost his job, you bought two tickets to Venice, and you said you'd walk over the Bridge of Sighs together.
Yeah. To gain perspective.
when you've been through so many...losses together...you're connected, you belong to each other.Always.
Sarah, Josh loves you.
it's taking about six of us to stop him from rushing in there, Sarah.
you want the truth?
this is it: he loves you.
subject is down. Hostage has weapon.
go, go, go, go!
move away from the door! Move away from the door!
down! Stay down! Put your hands where I can see them!
stay down! - Stay on the ground. Stay on the ground.
keep your hands where I can see them.
Eddie, paramedics, right away.
Hey, buddy, what's her status?
unstable. Knife hit a major vessel. Massive blood loss.
Sarah... Oh, my God.
is she gonna be all right?
we'll take care of her.
there. We'll get you in an ambulance. They'll take a look at you.
okay come on.
the hospital where the doctor will take a look at you.
this didn't have to happen. This did not have to happen.
there are always variables that we can't anticipate.
but, Sarge, we could've saved them both.
there's no way we could know.
11: 06 a.m. Callaghan: Boss, threat is low. I can do this. I see access.
Braddock: She wants the truth. She's responding. Give me a shot.
it was a risk either way.
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
I had a connection. She did not need to be subdued by force.
subject was lying prone on the floor, a knife wound to the chest.
we know, Jules. We were there.
11: 17. Subject in critical condition. Taken to hospital.
we were there.
I had eyes in. There was time to get in. The knife was down.
and then the hostage escalated.
which she wouldn't have if we'd already gone in.
Sam, you were the negotiator.
it's your right to call it how you see it.
we can't second-guess whether an earlier tactical response might have had a different outcome.
due respect, sir, but it came down to talk or tactics, and you're the one that called talk.
that's right.
because maybe that's the call a negotiator would make.
look, I'm just saying, all right?
I want to know what Ed would have done.
it was the sarge's call!
I want to know, too.
sometimes you do everything right.
things still go wrong.
that's the job.
situation was gray.
the boss made a black-and-white call.
we saved the hostage. Period.
uh, sorry. The hospital just called. Sarah Scott.
doctors got her stabilized. She's gonna be all right.
that's great, Kira. Thanks for letting us know. - Okay.
okay, then. That's good. Right?
need to talk. - Take a number.
all right. I'll see you tomorrow.
Hey, Eddie.
I'm sorry.
today should have gone better.
you need to be back where you belong.
team needs you back.
I'm thinking, I'm-I'm gonna get Soph, I'm gonna get Clark.
we're gonna go up and get a cottage, you know? Regroup, like you...
like you said.
that's great. That's great.
you know, unless, uh, you feel useless or something without me.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have jumped on you like that.
no, it's okay. I get it.
we all wanted them out safe.
what?
I don't know if we should do this.
sneaking around on the team.
we put our lives in each other' s hands, and...
Yeah, and you're thinking we should take a break.
I don't know. I don't know what I'm thinking.
me, neither.
okay, so, take a break tonight?
give us time to think?
or we could think while priming my drywall.
that's not fair.
you know how much I love priming drywall.
Yeah, almost as much as you love my protein-mango breakfast smoothies.
don't do this to me.
I'm just saying.
it's all clear.
the mind is its own place, and in itself can make heaven of hell, hell of heaven.
the mind is its own place, and in itself can make heaven of hell, hell of heaven.
the mind is its own place, and in itself can make heaven of hell, hell of heaven.
come on. Pick up the phone.
I swear to God I will kill her and I will take you down.
the mind is its own place, and in itself can...
penny? - No!
it's time.
Hey, Pips.
check this out.
globular cluster. Messier 3, I think.
who ate the ketchup chips?
must've been the coyotes.
grape juice? Coyotes drink grape juice, too?
Hey, Pips, see if you can find Saturn. I'm going for more grape juice.
for me. Not you, me.
that was fast, Dad.
dad? Dad?
long is the way and hard, that out of hell leads up to light.
good morning, Sunshine.
you can call me Sunshine as long you promise to...
Ah, yes, letter of application.
basic Tactical Operations course.
I'm signing it right now.
thank you, Sarge. - My pleasure, Kira.
everything okay?
Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine. Just...
just the way it always is.
Hey, baby.
where are you?
nearly home. How'd you sleep?
I didn't. I kept hearing noises.
but you know you're safe, right? - I know.
Hey, you know what? - What?
I've got a surprise for you.
you okay? - I'm gonna wet my pants.
okay. Come on. Let's go.
she's been missing for 12 hours.
police say she was abducted last night from a playground in Sault Sainte Marie.
her mother says her back was turned for only a second, and then, Lilly Deacon vanished.
Lilly was wearing a yellow dress and pink sandals.
she has long blonde hair, and has a birthmark under her chin shaped like a teardrop.
Hey, guys.
Hi, restroom? - Yeah, out back. Hang on.
you need a key. There you go. - Thank you.
Hey, Sarge, Wordy said you wanted to see me?
Hey, Jules, grab a seat, will you?
Ooh, that bad?
psych evaluations, you know they're mandatory, right?
Yeah, I do. I just, uh...
you just haven't signed up for one yet.
everyone else has done theirs already, and I wanted to make sure things were copacetic.
everything's copacetic.
look. Look at me. I'm signing up right now.
you know it's like this with you every year, Jules.
it's like, uh, nobody likes to do this.
I know, they just freak me out. All those questions.
who do you like better: your mom or dad?
you want to garden or paint? Fly a plane? Jump on a train?
they're just questions. No right or wrong answers.
that's the problem: I like right or wrong.
you shoot. There's a target. You hit it.
bull's-eye. Bam. You go home.
that's true. You can be perfect.
scared to make mistakes-- it's going to get in your way.
we're human. We're going to get things wrong.
Hey, great. So pump #2? That's, uh, $47. 28, please.
Hey, who's this? What's your name?
Jack. He's a little shy.
Hey, Jack, uh, tell me.
what's your favorite flavor here: cherry or grape?
it's okay. It's on the house.
cherry.
okay, but here comes the cherry airplane.
up it goes.
how about some change?
sure. Sorry about that.
and here we go.
uh, yeah, um... The-the missing girl? Lilly, Lilly something?
um, she's here. She's here at my gas station.
and she's, she's with a man and he has a gun.
ma'am, are you certain it's the child?
Yes, I'm absolutely sure.
she's wearing boy's clothes, and she has a birthmark underneath her chin.
okay, ma'am, I need you to stay calm, but if you can get a license plate...
license plate... License plate.
team One, gear up.
we have a sighting of missing child Lilly Deacon, traveling in a car license plate: Romeo 1 Bravo Uniform 4 Hotel 8.
registered to a Gerald Duglin, 60 Red Brick Lane, East Scarborough.
you're home.
I told you I was close.
Hello?
I want you to meet someone.
surprise.
penny, this is Lilly.
team One, Child Services have been notified and they're standing by;

Lilly Deacon was abducted, what, 500 miles north of here.
you did a beautiful job, Penny.
it's clean, huh?
you could eat off the floor.
Why?
why what?
why is she here? Did I do something?
all right, what's going on?
nothing. My son-- he sent back another letter, return to sender, big surprise.
you've got to see him in person. Where... He's in Dallas, right?
you've got to go there. It doesn't matter if they slam the door in your face.
Ah, I think I'm done, you know?
follow me. Come here.
this is really special, okay?
you are very important to me.
and this is going to help keep you safe.
there. Now what do you say?
what do you say when someone gives you a present?
thank you. - You're welcome.
here's how it works.
you get too close to a door or window, and you're going to feel a little buzz.
that's a warning.
and what happens if we don't pay attention to the buzz?
what happens if we go outside the house?
you cross the underground wire and the bracelet electric-shocks you and you die.
but you know what?
it's better to die than to get caught by the police 'cause you know what happens if you caught by the police?
they'll hurt you so bad, you'll wish you were dead.

it's why they asked me to bring you here.
they didn't.
Yeah, they did.
your dad and I had a long talk before we left last night.
my daddy wasn't there last night.
he was in Buffalo with my grandma.

I'll take you upstairs. - Gerald...
Yes, Penny?
um, let me show her around.
you're making lunch.
I can make it later. - What?

Lilly, no!
Lilly, come here.
she's just scared, Gerald.
penny, get in the closet.
no... Gerald, no.
in the closet.
please, please, she didn't mean it. Gerald, no!
enough. I've had enough. That's enough, okay? That's it. I've had enough of you. Okay?
the mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.
you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna show you the rest of house first.
we can explore. You want to see upstairs?
come on.
come on. Pick up the phone.
Hello?
Hello, Mr. Duglin?
this is Sergeant Gregory Parker, with the Police Strategic Response Unit.
am I speaking with Gerald Duglin?
Mr. Duglin, a little girl has been abducted and we have reason to believe that she's inside your house.
now if you and the other occupants can please exit, we can start talking about how you can safely return Lilly to her parents.
if you're interested in her safety, then you stay out of my house.
you step one foot in this house, and I swear to God I will kill her and I will take you down.
No!
it's time. They're here.
you know what to do.
I know what to do.
come on. Pick up the phone.
like we practiced, like I showed you.
what's happening?
they've come, okay.
who's come? - Don't worry. I'll protect you. Come on.
quick, Penny.
okay, take that. Take that.
well, you're staying with us though...
we're going to need more ammo, okay?
we've got more in the basement. I'll be right back. - No, we don't have any time.
two minutes. I'll be right back. I promise.

entry clear.
kitchen's clear.
boss, table's set for three.
clear.
living room's clear.
he saw us coming.
Sarge.
I'm looking at a box for an electric dog collar.
he might have a containment around the house.
so let's cut the circuit.
first floor clear.
we got something downstairs.
we got eyes.
okay, we've got Lilly Deacon with another young woman, approximately 16 years of age in...
looks like the master bedroom.
no sign of Duglin.
let's transmit that to Kira, see if she can ID that other girl.
possible accomplice.
Hey, Sam, can you get another angle of the bedroom?
see if Duglin's in there?
copy that.
he's not in there, boss.
boss, Lilly's upstairs, correct?
that's affirmative.
where are you?
basement steps.
police Strategic Response Unit! - Police!
get down! - Weapons on the ground!

how long have you lived here?
a long time.
don't you ever want to go home?
get down.
guys, she's armed.
Yes, she is. Camera's down.
all right, stand by for immediate action. Let's get up closer to the house.
we're on the move. We're gonna need two units lead us up.
Eddie, check in. Where are you?
boss, I don't know how he did it, but he's completely disappeared.
we lost him.
go careful. Duglin's not upstairs. We're on the move.
you heard that, right?
it's like a... like a scraping sound or...
ed, look at these marks on the floor.
go, go, go.
Sarge, we found a tunnel.
we're going in.
okay, you go for it, but keep me posted.
Sarge, I think I got a match on your girl.
I'm sending it through now.
rap sheet, any priors?
no, sir, found her in Missing Persons.
matches an aged-up picture of Penny Westler.
who?
missing child taken from her own backyard eight years ago: stranger abduction.
no arrest made. - Oh, my God.
she must be 17 by now.
okay, team, subject is on foot.
constables Lane and Wordsworth are in pursuit.
we've got the neighborhood contained.
we need to get this under control now.
we're in front of the house now.
change of plans: we're gonna talk this girl down.
Jules, I want you to do it.
Oh, Sarge, if you're right, this girl's been in here, like, eight years.
we're dealing with some serious Stockholm syndrome.
she probably doesn't even know who she is anymore.
I know, and my bet, he's conditioned her to fear the police, and that's why she's firing.
now, you're gonna be fine.
this girl has spent eight years in captivity at the hands of a man.
what she needs now is a female voice.
all right, we're starting at ground zero. I mean, I...
I don't know if I know how to do this.
all right, I'm coming in.
okay, wait.
can you help me with the Stockholm?
Yeah.
now, the first thing to remember...
there will be nothing simple about her feelings for her captor.
just follow the same rules as always: connect, respect， protect. Okay.
okay, just keep it simple.
by now, Penny's got a belief system that has helped her survive whatever it is she survived, and it's not your job to tear that down.
it's your job to get these two girls out of there safely, and I'm gonna stay right here and be your second inside your ear the whole time, all right?
copy.
spike, you go with Sam; you cover Jules.
Lou, we need to track down Penny's parents.
get them here fast, but I need to talk to them first.
copy. - Eddie, what's your direction?
we're in a tunnel heading west.
okay, stay on it.
Kira, you want to map this out for us, tell us where the hell we are?
he's up ahead. Go, go, go.
Hey, girls, my name is Jules.
slow down, Jules. Just work against the adrenaline.
your names are Penny and Lilly. Is that right?
well, I'm a police officer, and I'm here to help you both.
you know, I'd really like to open these doors so that we can speak easier.
is that okay?
all right, I'm opening the door, but I promise you, I'm gonna stay back here, all right?
penny, is that right?
the little girl that you have with you, her name is Lilly Deacon, and I'm really hoping that we can return her safely to her mom and dad.
can we can work that out? Can you help us out with that?
get away from us!
team status-- everybody.
no harm.
no harm, no harm. - No harm.
Sarge?
De-escalate, Jules, de-escalate.
whatever Penny's world was an hour ago, it's a whole lot more confusing now, so just...
just keep doing what you're doing. Just stay covered.
how do they know my name?
everything they say is a lie.
I know that you are very scared right now.
I mean, you've got a gun with you.
and guns are always scary.
but I... but I really believe that you don't want to hurt anyone.
I really believe that, Penny.
so what do you think?
what do you think? Can we get rid of the gun?
