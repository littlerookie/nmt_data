there's no sign of it, so we figure the killer took it.
robbery gone bad? - No, there's a lot of other valuables left behind.
okay, get a list of what's missing and call Jane and ask him why he isn't here already.
Patrick Jane, CBI. I'm on the way to a crime scene.
do you know how fast you were going, sir?
do I get a prize if I guess correctly?
13 miles per hour over the posted speed limit.
I need your license and proof of insurance.
I'd love to, but, uh, we got a murder to solve.
evidence degrading, killers perfecting their alibis.
first 48 hours - you know that, right?
license and proof of insurance.
I mean, is this really necessary?
aren't we all part of the justice league?
do you think aquaman would give batman a ticket?
just consider that.
step out of the car.
there's no sign of a struggle. She probably knew the killer.
but if it was personal, why take her video equipment?
agent Lisbon, we might have something.
one of my officers is engaged in a pursuit off a traffic stop.
driver was acting crazy. Could be our guy.
don't say a word.
vehicle is a blue citroen, about 30 years old, california plates.
see what you did?
pull over right now.
morning, Lisbon. - Let me see your hands!
did I miss anything?
agent, I'm not opposed to extending professional courtesy, but your man ignored a reasonable request from my officer and fled.
he will pay the ticket. - Meh. Speed traps. Legalized extortion.
but no, you lay in wait, like thieves in the night.
he will pay the ticket today. - I'm not gonna pay it.
Jane! Stop-stop that. - I won't pay it. I'm not paying it. Extortionist.
if Mr. Jane will go to city hall and settle this today, we can move on.
thank you. - I'd like an apology.
Oh, really? Dream bigger, pal. You're not gonna get one from me.
I said we'd move on.
Yes, we're moving on.
don't know why you were in such an all-fired hurry to get here.
I'll tell you who killed that woman. - Who's that?
local scumbag named Ronald Crosswhite. Killed his wife two years ago.
he was indicted for murdering his wife.
Oh, he did it, all right. - Sergeant Rowley.
why isn't he in prison?
there was a... screw-up.
evidentiary paperwork got filed late.
judge excluded some security footage.
critical evidence. Crosswhite walked.
and you're the one that screwed up.
that's why you can't stop looking at that poor woman's body.
because you feel responsible.
also explains why when there's a murder in town, you're out working the speed trap.
you smart-ass. - Stand down. Now.
Yeah.
looks like we both have a little problem controlling our underlings.
Underling? - Even if crosswhite did kill his wife, what does that have to do with Amber Sutherland?
saw the two of 'em together day before yesterday.
now she's dead. No way that's a coincidence.
Underling? Really?
Lisbon, would you explain to this man I'm - you need to stop.
I'm a consultant. I'm not below or above. - He's a consultant.
I am to the side. - That's enough.
ginger Crosswhite was 31. Worked at city hall, dmv clerk.
shot and killed in their living room two years ago.
the d. a. claimed crosswhite did it for insurance money.
he had an upholstery shop that was struggling.
and he walked?
Crosswhite claimed he came home from a drive and found the body.
a security camera image showed him arriving home an hour before he said he got there. Destroyed his alibi.
but sergeant Rowley missed the deadline to file the search warrant, the judge excluded it, and the case collapsed.
good work. The mayor's wife is coming in to the office.
her name's Jessica Bagshaw.
she was supervising Amber Sutherland's video work.
I'll get her statement. - Okay.
be careful. They have a lot of pull.
Teresa Lisbon, toughest gal west of the pecos, and you're scared of a small town mayor and his wife.
yeah? - Mr. Crosswhite, we're with the CBI.
I'm agent Teresa Lisbon. - And I'm Patrick Jane.
we want to ask you some questions about Amber Sutherland.
Tom Rowley tell you about me?
Yes, he did. - That's my buddy Tom.
can we come in?
how did you know Amber?
she, um...
she was filming me for a documentary.
the one about the mayor? - No, this was about my wife's death.
what are you doing?
your wife looked lovely. She had a very gentle face.
put that down. - why?
just put it down. - Fair enough.
so Amber was making a documentary about you?
Yeah. She-she did a couple interviews.
she said she'd need to - to raise money to finish it.
that must have been nice for you-tell your side to Amber.
you have no idea.
the man who killed my wife is still out there.
but everyone in town thinks I'm the killer.
it's-it's around me all the time...
it's like being underwater.
feels like I can't breathe.
well, if you didn't kill your wife, what'd you do to her?
what?
you're the guiltiest-looking man I've ever seen.
the theatrical squalor, forcing yourself to live with the hatred of your neighbors.
if you didn't kill your wife, then why the self-punishment?
you need to get out of here. now. - I have to agree.
well, it's just an honest opinion, a legit question. I'm doing my job.
okay. Have a nice day.
it just seems insane - Amber, gone.
she worked closely with you.
she was with us pretty much every day, the last couple of weeks.
we'll need to speak with your husband, mayor Bagshaw.
of course. He's forging away on the campaign trail.
elks clubs and coffee klatches.
do you have any idea why someone would want to hurt Amber?
I can't imagine.
I mean, she was just... such a gentle soul.
you know anything about her personal life? She seeing anybody?
um, she had been on a few dates with Zach Gladden.
he works at city hall.
was she close with anyone else?
maybe someone with the campaign?
what is it that you're suggesting?
nothing. Just... She was pretty and
and my husband is attractive and charming and powerful. Right?
um, that's not what I was suggesting.
it's how rumors get started. Um...
we have no interest havivg a pretty dead woman attached to the campaign, if you get my drift, agent?
director Bertram. - Gale.
I was gonna come and see you, soon as agent Van Pelt was done with me.
agent, is she done?
Yes, sir. - Let's grab a cup of coffee.
crane - Tell us about Amber. - I don't know what to say.
she was cool. God, that's lame.
she was from Los Angeles. She was funny.
really hard-working. Tenacious.
we hear she was spending some time with a man named Ronald Crosswhite, making a documentary?
he had been bugging her since she got into town.
someone new to listen to his garbage.
Garbage-is that how Amber saw it?
she said she was maintaing her journalistic objectivity.
least until a couple of days ago. - What happened?
she had an interview with him and she said Crosswhite... freaked out.
you okay?
Yeah, I guess I'm just... nervous, you know?
let's start the questions.
amber e-mailed this video of the Crosswhite interview to a producer friend in L. A. . four days ago.
uh, just gotta jump right in, huh?
that's right. Your upholstery shop was still open then.
this the scary part? - Wait.
there's a discrepancy about the time- there-there's no discrepancy.
I've been looking at the security camera footage
d- d-don't tell me about s-security footage.
I was there when I said I was there.
I came home, and my wife was dead.
I mean, don't you get it? there's-there's a real killer out there somewhere.
okay. - You said you believed me.
calm down. - Were you lying?
were you lying, too? Are you one of them? - please calm down.
you one of the-I mean, what is-don't tell me to calm down!
what is this? What is this, a set-up?
I just- Please- - turn that off! Turn that off!
I'll get a warrant first thing in the morning.
get a list of Amber's missing equipment and the serial numbers.
on it.
we're serving a warrant on Crosswhite first thing in the morning, and you're coming with.
Oh, sounds like fun.
don't worry. We're dropping you at city hall so you can pay that speeding ticket.
I thought I made my feelings very, uh, clear on that particular subject.
which is why I told chief nail if you don't pay it by noon tomorrow, he's free to get a bench warrant for your arrest.
we're citizens, too. We're not above the law.
Oh, well, thanks for that, gandhi.
what I don't appreciate is this cheap police state tactics.
whatever works.
he's not here. Warrant's good either way, so, Cho, open the door.
boss.
found this in the garage.
the serial number matches Amber's video equipment.
call Van Pelt. Have her put a bolo out on Crosswhite. We need to bring him in.
thank you.
uh, excuse me, ma'am? Um, I have a-I have a ticket.
Yes, see that clerk.
so... You're the bagman. - I guess.
well, I would like to pay this ticket...
but under protest.
nobody pays any other way.
everybody stay where they are!
everybody just stay right were they are.
now, you...
you get out there and lock those front doors.
try running, you'll have blood on your hands. Go.
okay. Okay, ev - Everybody over there. Over there by the window!
get over there!
stay there.
nobody move!
Oh, good. More guns.
chief. What's going on?
got a report Crosswhite's in there with a gun. He's got hostages.
we should secure the perimeter and make contact with Crosswhite.
well, thanks for the advice. My people and I are gonna handle this.
you don't want to start a gunfight unless you need to.
we should get the information first.
if I hearing right, got a group of citizens in there being threatened by a nut with a gun.
I don't need to know more than that.
get over there! Other-other side!
move! Move! I said move!
okay. Three with me through the front door.
the rest of you, hit the fire exit round back.
you start a shooting gallery in there, and people are gonna get killed.
see you when we're done. - CBI has authority here.
I will start arresting your men and putting them in cuffs if you don't stand down right now.
chief,
no, she's right. CBI has jurisdiction... For now.
you. What's your name? - Donna.
Donna? You look familiar. You a d. a?
I'm a paralegal.
Jane, right? CBI? What are you doing here?
nothing. In fact, I was just - I was just leave.
I just heard on my police scanner that you guys were looking to arrest me.
you people thought all along that I killed Amber, didn't you?
what I thought is irrelevant now, but how exactly is this gun-waving supposed to establish your innocence?
Oh, I tried talking. It doesn't work. Nobody listens.
mind if I get that?
Hello?
Jane? Are you in city hall?
uh... Yes, unfortunately. - Is anybody hurt?
not mortally yet. - What's going on?
I'd love to chat with you, Lisbon, but there's a man here with a large gun, who wants to talk to you.
who's this?
Mr. Crosswhite, this is agent Lisbon. Let's just take it easy, okay?
you tell all those cops to stay out of here.
I will. Why are you doing this, mr. Crosswhite?
why-why am I doing this? Why are you doing this?
I'm not doing anything but talking to you. What do you want?
I want a guarantee from the governor and the state attorney general that I will not be prosecuted for the death of Amber Sutherland.
we can talk about that.
and I want - I want a new investigation into my wife's death, and I want the real killer found. Do it now.
I had two months left on that plan.
may have found a way to hear what's going on in there.
if we can patch into the main switchboard for city hall, we can turn any phone with a speaker on it into a microphone.
do it. Where's nail?
he's taken over the cafe on the corner for a command center.
nail's tapped into the cameras around city hall.
it's clever. - Well, just trying to keep up.
it's the rear entrance to city hall.
it's alarmed, but we can disarm it from here.
we create a distraction in front, send men in that way, and we'll minimize casualties.
it's procedure to try and talk the person who's taken the hostages out.
that's what we're gonna do.
work with me, Lisbon. We need a plan "b.
hell with that. Let's go.
we are not going in unless Crosswhite fires first.
it's the safest path.
unless you're the first hostage Crosswhite decides to shoot.
someone want to tell me what's going on?
mayor bagshaw, I'm agent Lisbon with the CBI.
glad to hear it. Nail, what's the plan?
Flashbangs through the side window, move in through the back, - take Crosswhite out. - Get started on it.
an assault like that should be the last resort, not the first.
a half-dozen people, including my wife, are in that building with an armed lunatic.
I want them out. - I won't allow it. CBI has the authority here.
no. Not anymore. You're to work with us now.
if you don't believe me, talk to your boss. I already did.
Lisbon, it's a matter of taking the feelings of the locals into account.
sir, this is a matter of people not getting killed.
you'll do your best to prevent that, I trust.
I can't if I don't have the authority.
now I know mayor Bagshaw has a lot of influence, but
no, there's no "but." all right? Influence has influence.
I don't have texexpln the politics of this to you, do I?
sir, this isn't about politics.
everything's politics, Lisbon... One way or another.
try persuasion. Works wonders.
what's the word? - We're on our own.
no, you don't want them going in. We better do something. They're saddling up.
Teresa, I know you're busy, but I'm babysitting a bunch of reporters out there who'll take a minute whenever you've got one.
not now, Brenda. - Fine. Uh, let me know when you can.
wait a minute. One. Now.
great. Uh, anyone in particular? Or should I just pick somebody?
who do you think has the best access to director Bertram?
we're human beings. We have a right to use the bathroom.
there's one in the mayor's office, just right around that corner.
Hey, You're one of those cops from out of town, right?
uh, something like that, yeah.
are you, like, working on a plan to get us out of this?
Yes. Of course I am.
what are you doing?
well, I'm - I'm thinking. And waiting.
what are you, like, 5? A little patience here.
they're gonna come in, you know.
and it's gonna get all shooty. What's that gonna prove?
you know what? Don't put this on me.
you're like all the rest of them. You just decided I killed Amber.
s - same way they just decided I killed my wife.
well, more times than not, it is the husband that did it.
Yeah, well, I didn't.
there were break-ins all around the neighborhood.
this was a robbery gone wrong.
I mean, just because some camera says I was someplace when I wasn't.
no, they didn't even bother to-to- to look into the robberies.
that's not true.
what did you say?
we looked into those break-ins. It was just kids.
they turned on each other the moment they got arrested.
they're not killers. - Donna...
you said you weren't in the d. a.'s office.
no, I-I just said I was a paralegal.
somebody killed my wife, and you were too busy blaming me to catch them.
I- I-I'm sorry I said anything. Please- Please don't shoot me.
I'm not gonna shoot you. I
well, waving the gun in her face is not a great idea.
everybody just needs to shut up!
look, I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry. Just please...
just stop it.
I can help her.
Yeah, please.
it's okay. It's okay.
just stand up. Breathe.
just come over here and take a seat.
you know the breath is the switch between the conscious and the subconscious mind?
it's how one controls the other.
just breathe.
just breathe and relax.
boss, we've tapped into the phones at city hall. You're gonna wanna hear this.
Lisbon. - Agent lisbon.
I just had a conversation with a reporter from the "examiner."
he seemed to know a lot about the situation in Crane creek.
now, I told him that no matter what any unnamed source might say, CBI puts civilian safety first and that we were not bowing to local pressure to do otherwise.
I also told him that authority in Crane Creek resides with our head agent in the field. You.
I've let Bagshaw and his chief know that you're in charge.
thank you, sir.
we'll discuss this again.
good luck, agent.
in... out. That's good.
in... Letting yourself relax.
in and out. Just relaxing.
what's he playing at?
sound like he's hypnotizing someone. - ... All the way.
breathing in and out. - Sir, we're ready to go.
stand down. No assault unless crosswhite starts shooting.
agent lisbon is in charge. - This is ridiculous.
it's done. Get back to your post.
relaxing your body...
in... And out.
relaxing your body. Let your eyes close.
that's good. That's good.
your mind is in fight-or-flight mode.
there's nothing you can do about that now, so just breathe in...
and out. Let it all fall away...
fall into the floor.
now, see yourself...
in a warm, safe place.
in... And out.
now you're drifting.
just drifting away.
they tried to kill me.
they tried to kill me.
I can't believe it.
they tried to kill me.
they tried to kill me.
close the blinds! Go!
stand down! Do not fire! Do not fire!
on the ground! Get on the ground! - Face down! Do it now!
well, what now? - You got me.
you could answer the phone.
well, that's gonna make it a little tricky to talk to 'em.
you're gonna talk to them.
okay.
we're gonna book you for attempted murder.
call your lawyer, your union rep, I don't care.
I'm the reason that Sutherland girl's dead. I wanted to make it right.
Cho, get him out of here. - Come on.
boss - Yeah, I know. We lost the phones inside.
no, no, no. It's jane.
don't shoot me.
Oh, Lisbon. Nice of you to show up. - Jane?
you know, you people ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
Crosswhite hasn't shot anyone, and you've shot Donna.
is she all right?
uh, for a shot person, yeah. She's fine. It's just a graze.
well, that was sergeant Rowley, acting on his own. - Says you.
look, Rowley's screwups have cost me enough.
if it wasn't for him, none of us would be here.
you're angry? How do you think he feels?
don't start to sympathize with him. - Who is Ronald Crosswhite?
he's a man that no one has listened to, a man that has been abused and pushed around.
it's hard not to sympathize with the man.
I do. I feel for him.
damn it! This isn't a therapy session! - No, it's not.
he says you got one hour to put him in touch with the governor and the attorney general, or he starts shooting hostages.
we'll get on that. In the meantime, could you ask him to please release the injured woman?
I never thought of that. That's a great idea.
not bad, CBI.
tell me you didn't kill your wife.
I didn't kill my wife.
hmm. You cheat on her? - no.
you kept some secret from her. - no.
Yes. There's something.
you just thought about it. What was it?
I... I - I was a smoker.
she hated it. You told her you quit, but you hadn't.
what did you do?
I... went for long drives, uh, clear my head...
snuck a smoke, figured what's the big deal, right?
that's what you were doing the night she died.
uh, I went for a drive, I listened to some music, had a few smokes.
came home, she was on the ground. There was blood.
put my hands to my face, smelled the smoke on my fingers.
the last thing I told her was a lie.
and that's the guilt you carry around.
I should have been there.
I should have been there with her.
have you ever considered that the killer was waiting for you to leave?
does that mean you believe me?
sure, I guess.
but taking us hostage to prove it is the dumbest idea you've ever had.
Donna... The security camera footage
the big evidence against mr. Crosswhite-who owned it?
uh, the el-electric company. - Perfect.
and Rowley's mistake- The one that got it thrown out
pretty stupid? Hard to anticipate?
of all the paperwork to forget, rowley picd the worst.
that'll do.
Crosswhite, forget about the deadline.
I will tell you who murdered your wife in 20 minutes.
I just need three things. - What?
first, donna here is injured. Let her go so she can be taken care of.
there's plenty of us here to shoot if that's what you feel like doing.
Hey, wha- - Second-I need to go to the bathroom.
Oh, me, too. - And me.
fine.
we all get to go to the bathroom. And third, I need a pen and some paper.
that's all you need to find my wife's killer?
Yeah. You think the governor can say that? I doubt it.
okay.
you okay to walk? - Oh, I'm fine.
tell Kenyon that I'm okay. Tell him-- No messages. Go ahead. Open her up.
Donna. Donna. So brave. Oh, so
Oh! Sorry. Forgot about your... - I'm all right.
my bad.
did Jane tell you to say anything? Give you a message?
no. He just gave me a hug.
a hug?
excuse me.
what's it say? - "hey, everybody. Solved the case.
saw envelope on mayor's desk left by Amber.
must be what the killer was looking for.
can't get to it right now. Yours truly, Jane.
P. s. - Lisbon, I'm not paying the ticket.
I don't know what the hell that means, but in ten minutes, the deadline's up.
Crosswhite said he's gonna start shooting people.
now, I don't care what you have on, Bertram.
if that psycho hurts my wife, I will break you.
your ball game, Lisbon.
so what happens now?
well, what happens now is, you and I take a walk outside.
are you crazy? - Easy as pie.
uh, they'll shoot me. - Not if I'm standing next to you.
I won't take that chance.
well, you can take the walk outside, or you can stay in here and wait for them to come in shooting.
personally, I like your chances out there.
I won't do it. I don't even know why I'm listening to you.
because I know what I'm talking about. You're on the edge, and I've been there.
it's a dark and lonely place, and I'm telling you, this is the way back.
and more than anything else, I'm offering you what you want
your wife's killer standing in front of you in chains.
now, if you go out there, there's a chance that you will see that, but if you stay in here, you will probably die.
this is just a trick. - Oh, I wish.
if this was a trick, I'd be a lot more confident.
this is 60/40 at best.
but what's plan "b," huh? You coming?
Oh, that's a lot of guns.
drop your weapon now!
you get crosswhite. We'll get the hostages out.
on your belly! Hands by your sides! Spread your legs and don't move!
you all right? - Right as rain.
easy, Rigsby. Easy.
well, looks like you had it wrong.
there was no envelope on the mayor's desk.
you're gonna wanna see this.
there's nothing there because you have it stuffed inside your bulletproof vest.
excuse me?
he killed Ginger Crosswhite, and he killed Amber Sutherland.
what possible reason could I have to hurt those women?
well, Ginger, I'm not so sure about yet, but Amber...
she found out, didn't she?
you got your killer right there.
Yeah, and you were terrified I was starting to believe him.
if he was telling the truth about what time he came home that night...
then the security footage doesn't make sense.
what do you mean?
well, it's unlikely the electric company meddled with it.
you had access to thidence and you changed it.
but what you didn't know is she left a message about what she found on the mayor's desk.
there was no envelope.
Yes, there was...
cause I put it there.
now let's see it.
chief Nail, take off your vest.
open it.
read it out.
arrest arrest me.
okay.
look at that, huh? You don't have to say that twice.
I'm not going to jail! - Don't do it!
that was close.
we have people looking at the security footage right now.
it's only a matter of time before they figure out what you did.
now you're a cop about to go into the sysme you do the math.
ginger Crosswhite got herself killed.
I want you to understand that.
we'd talked at city hall. She was not an innocent.
she married down. Anybody could see that - I certainly could.
it was clear as day that she was unhappy.
there was a connection between us. Very powerful one.
at least, I felt there was.
but she was gonna tell the world...
like I assaulted her.
Defiled...
like I was some disgusting... thing.
Where'd you get the video of Crosswhite?
I hacked into the security footage, changed the time stamp.
I had crosswhite cold.
and that idiot Rowley forgot to file the warrant.
so Crosswhite walked...
and lived in a purgatory you created for him until he met Amber, and she figured out that there was something wrong with the footage?
said the "meta-data" didn't match.
she had no idea I was involved.
and she said that she hadn't told anyone else, so I met her at her home.
and you took her cameras, and you planted one at Crosswhite's.
in for a penny.
I thought that...
when I confessed, I would feel a weight lift.
I don't feel anything.
Crosswhite. It's time.
Hey, uh...Sorry about the whole jail thing, but you did take a bunch of people hostage.
I don't care. Jail doesn't mean anything to me now.
Yeah, well, see how you feel about that in a couple years.
are you familiar with the regulations regarding agents giving anonymous statements to the press?
CBI employees shall not give anonymous or "off the record" statements to members of the media.
and what are the repercussions of said violation?
suspension or termination. - yes.
however, both the Bagshaws are happy.
everyone's alive. We caught the killer.
Yes, sir.
see, you-you find the right lever, agent, you can move the world.
you found the right lever. That was a smart play.
I hope you stay smart.
what was that about? - Oh, it was just business. What's that?
this-this is my speeding ticket that I refuse to pay.
well, I'm not paying it.
well, then I guess no one's gonna pay.
I'll get Bertram to pay it. - How are you gonna do that?
I have my ways.
it's on your desk!
crane
Absolutely. Sir, I'll let you know as soon as I know anything.
not at all. It's my pleasure. Crap.
director?
Bertram wants regular updates.
somebody involved in this case must be connected.
well, maybe we'll get lucky, catch a dunk. We're due an easy one.
Ugh, you shouldn't have said that. - Said what?
"we're due an easy one." now we're jinxed.
sorry.
amber Sutherland, documentary filmmaker. The house is a rental.
she's been in Crane Creek for about two months making a campaign video for mayor Kenyon Bagshaw.
isn't a campaign video overkill for a small town mayor?
well, Bagshaw's moving up.
he's running in a special election for the house of representatives.
surprise. Connected.
agent Lisbon? Chief Arnold Nail, Crane Creek p. d.
my men responded to a shots-fired call last night, found the body.
agent Cho, agent Rigsby. - Men.
your men search the area? - We found a. 38 in a trash can down the street.
serial number shows it reported stolen from a man one town over, about a year ago.
we're gonna need that. - Got it.
and just so you know, I get it.
CBI's in charge. We're here to assist.
Thanks, chief. We don't always get a welcome.
well, I said I get it. I didn't say I liked it.
looks like the killer tossed the place. Anything missing?
apparently, Amber had a lot of high-end video equipment.
there's no sign of it, so we figure the killer took it.
robbery gone bad? - No, there's a lot of other valuables left behind.
okay, get a list of what's missing and call Jane and ask him why he isn't here already.
Patrick Jane, CBI. I'm on the way to a crime scene.
do you know how fast you were going, sir?
do I get a prize if I guess correctly?
13 miles per hour over the posted speed limit.
I need your license and proof of insurance.
I'd love to, but, uh, we got a murder to solve.
evidence degrading, killers perfecting their alibis.
first 48 hours - you know that, right?
license and proof of insurance.
I mean, is this really necessary?
aren't we all part of the justice league?
do you think aquaman would give batman a ticket?
just consider that.
step out of the car.
there's no sign of a struggle. She probably knew the killer.
but if it was personal, why take her video equipment?
agent Lisbon, we might have something.
one of my officers is engaged in a pursuit off a traffic stop.
driver was acting crazy. Could be our guy.
don't say a word.
vehicle is a blue citroen, about 30 years old, california plates.
see what you did?
pull over right now.
morning, Lisbon. - Let me see your hands!
did I miss anything?
agent, I'm not opposed to extending professional courtesy, but your man ignored a reasonable request from my officer and fled.
he will pay the ticket. - Meh. Speed traps. Legalized extortion.
but no, you lay in wait, like thieves in the night.
he will pay the ticket today. - I'm not gonna pay it.
Jane! Stop-stop that. - I won't pay it. I'm not paying it. Extortionist.
if Mr. Jane will go to city hall and settle this today, we can move on.
thank you. - I'd like an apology.
Oh, really? Dream bigger, pal. You're not gonna get one from me.
I said we'd move on.
Yes, we're moving on.
don't know why you were in such an all-fired hurry to get here.
I'll tell you who killed that woman. - Who's that?
local scumbag named Ronald Crosswhite. Killed his wife two years ago.
he was indicted for murdering his wife.
Oh, he did it, all right. - Sergeant Rowley.
why isn't he in prison?
there was a... screw-up.
evidentiary paperwork got filed late.
judge excluded some security footage.
critical evidence. Crosswhite walked.
and you're the one that screwed up.
that's why you can't stop looking at that poor woman's body.
because you feel responsible.
also explains why when there's a murder in town, you're out working the speed trap.
you smart-ass. - Stand down. Now.
Yeah.
looks like we both have a little problem controlling our underlings.
Underling? - Even if crosswhite did kill his wife, what does that have to do with Amber Sutherland?
saw the two of 'em together day before yesterday.
now she's dead. No way that's a coincidence.
Underling? Really?
Lisbon, would you explain to this man I'm - you need to stop.
I'm a consultant. I'm not below or above. - He's a consultant.
I am to the side. - That's enough.
ginger Crosswhite was 31. Worked at city hall, dmv clerk.
shot and killed in their living room two years ago.
the d. a. claimed crosswhite did it for insurance money.
he had an upholstery shop that was struggling.
and he walked?
Crosswhite claimed he came home from a drive and found the body.
a security camera image showed him arriving home an hour before he said he got there. Destroyed his alibi.
but sergeant Rowley missed the deadline to file the search warrant, the judge excluded it, and the case collapsed.
good work. The mayor's wife is coming in to the office.
her name's Jessica Bagshaw.
she was supervising Amber Sutherland's video work.
I'll get her statement. - Okay.
be careful. They have a lot of pull.
Teresa Lisbon, toughest gal west of the pecos, and you're scared of a small town mayor and his wife.
yeah? - Mr. Crosswhite, we're with the CBI.
I'm agent Teresa Lisbon. - And I'm Patrick Jane.
we want to ask you some questions about Amber Sutherland.
Tom Rowley tell you about me?
Yes, he did. - That's my buddy Tom.
can we come in?
how did you know Amber?
she, um...
she was filming me for a documentary.
the one about the mayor? - No, this was about my wife's death.
what are you doing?
your wife looked lovely. She had a very gentle face.
put that down. - why?
just put it down. - Fair enough.
so Amber was making a documentary about you?
Yeah. She-she did a couple interviews.
she said she'd need to - to raise money to finish it.
that must have been nice for you-tell your side to Amber.
you have no idea.
the man who killed my wife is still out there.
but everyone in town thinks I'm the killer.
it's-it's around me all the time...
it's like being underwater.
feels like I can't breathe.
well, if you didn't kill your wife, what'd you do to her?
what?
you're the guiltiest-looking man I've ever seen.
the theatrical squalor, forcing yourself to live with the hatred of your neighbors.
if you didn't kill your wife, then why the self-punishment?
you need to get out of here. now. - I have to agree.
well, it's just an honest opinion, a legit question. I'm doing my job.
okay. Have a nice day.
it just seems insane - Amber, gone.
she worked closely with you.
she was with us pretty much every day, the last couple of weeks.
we'll need to speak with your husband, mayor Bagshaw.
of course. He's forging away on the campaign trail.
elks clubs and coffee klatches.
do you have any idea why someone would want to hurt Amber?
I can't imagine.
I mean, she was just... such a gentle soul.
you know anything about her personal life? She seeing anybody?
um, she had been on a few dates with Zach Gladden.
he works at city hall.
was she close with anyone else?
maybe someone with the campaign?
what is it that you're suggesting?
nothing. Just... She was pretty and
and my husband is attractive and charming and powerful. Right?
um, that's not what I was suggesting.
it's how rumors get started. Um...
we have no interest havivg a pretty dead woman attached to the campaign, if you get my drift, agent?
director Bertram. - Gale.
I was gonna come and see you, soon as agent Van Pelt was done with me.
agent, is she done?
Yes, sir. - Let's grab a cup of coffee.
crane - Tell us about Amber. - I don't know what to say.
she was cool. God, that's lame.
she was from Los Angeles. She was funny.
really hard-working. Tenacious.
we hear she was spending some time with a man named Ronald Crosswhite, making a documentary?
he had been bugging her since she got into town.
someone new to listen to his garbage.
Garbage-is that how Amber saw it?
she said she was maintaing her journalistic objectivity.
least until a couple of days ago. - What happened?
she had an interview with him and she said Crosswhite... freaked out.
you okay?
Yeah, I guess I'm just... nervous, you know?
let's start the questions.
amber e-mailed this video of the Crosswhite interview to a producer friend in L. A. . four days ago.
uh, just gotta jump right in, huh?
that's right. Your upholstery shop was still open then.
this the scary part? - Wait.
there's a discrepancy about the time- there-there's no discrepancy.
I've been looking at the security camera footage
d- d-don't tell me about s-security footage.
I was there when I said I was there.
I came home, and my wife was dead.
I mean, don't you get it? there's-there's a real killer out there somewhere.
okay. - You said you believed me.
calm down. - Were you lying?
were you lying, too? Are you one of them? - please calm down.
you one of the-I mean, what is-don't tell me to calm down!
what is this? What is this, a set-up?
I just- Please- - turn that off! Turn that off!
I'll get a warrant first thing in the morning.
get a list of Amber's missing equipment and the serial numbers.
on it.
we're serving a warrant on Crosswhite first thing in the morning, and you're coming with.
Oh, sounds like fun.
don't worry. We're dropping you at city hall so you can pay that speeding ticket.
I thought I made my feelings very, uh, clear on that particular subject.
which is why I told chief nail if you don't pay it by noon tomorrow, he's free to get a bench warrant for your arrest.
we're citizens, too. We're not above the law.
Oh, well, thanks for that, gandhi.
what I don't appreciate is this cheap police state tactics.
whatever works.
he's not here. Warrant's good either way, so, Cho, open the door.
boss.
found this in the garage.
the serial number matches Amber's video equipment.
call Van Pelt. Have her put a bolo out on Crosswhite. We need to bring him in.
thank you.
uh, excuse me, ma'am? Um, I have a-I have a ticket.
Yes, see that clerk.
so... You're the bagman. - I guess.
well, I would like to pay this ticket...
but under protest.
nobody pays any other way.
everybody stay where they are!
everybody just stay right were they are.
now, you...
you get out there and lock those front doors.
try running, you'll have blood on your hands. Go.
okay. Okay, ev - Everybody over there. Over there by the window!
get over there!
stay there.
nobody move!
Oh, good. More guns.
chief. What's going on?
got a report Crosswhite's in there with a gun. He's got hostages.
we should secure the perimeter and make contact with Crosswhite.
well, thanks for the advice. My people and I are gonna handle this.
you don't want to start a gunfight unless you need to.
we should get the information first.
if I hearing right, got a group of citizens in there being threatened by a nut with a gun.
I don't need to know more than that.
get over there! Other-other side!
move! Move! I said move!
okay. Three with me through the front door.
the rest of you, hit the fire exit round back.
you start a shooting gallery in there, and people are gonna get killed.
see you when we're done. - CBI has authority here.
I will start arresting your men and putting them in cuffs if you don't stand down right now.
chief,
no, she's right. CBI has jurisdiction... For now.
you. What's your name? - Donna.
Donna? You look familiar. You a d. a?
I'm a paralegal.
Jane, right? CBI? What are you doing here?
nothing. In fact, I was just - I was just leave.
I just heard on my police scanner that you guys were looking to arrest me.
you people thought all along that I killed Amber, didn't you?
what I thought is irrelevant now, but how exactly is this gun-waving supposed to establish your innocence?
Oh, I tried talking. It doesn't work. Nobody listens.
mind if I get that?
Hello?
Jane? Are you in city hall?
uh... Yes, unfortunately. - Is anybody hurt?
not mortally yet. - What's going on?
I'd love to chat with you, Lisbon, but there's a man here with a large gun, who wants to talk to you.
who's this?
Mr. Crosswhite, this is agent Lisbon. Let's just take it easy, okay?
you tell all those cops to stay out of here.
I will. Why are you doing this, mr. Crosswhite?
why-why am I doing this? Why are you doing this?
I'm not doing anything but talking to you. What do you want?
I want a guarantee from the governor and the state attorney general that I will not be prosecuted for the death of Amber Sutherland.
we can talk about that.
and I want - I want a new investigation into my wife's death, and I want the real killer found. Do it now.
I had two months left on that plan.
may have found a way to hear what's going on in there.
if we can patch into the main switchboard for city hall, we can turn any phone with a speaker on it into a microphone.
do it. Where's nail?
he's taken over the cafe on the corner for a command center.
nail's tapped into the cameras around city hall.
it's clever. - Well, just trying to keep up.
it's the rear entrance to city hall.
it's alarmed, but we can disarm it from here.
we create a distraction in front, send men in that way, and we'll minimize casualties.
it's procedure to try and talk the person who's taken the hostages out.
that's what we're gonna do.
work with me, Lisbon. We need a plan "b.
hell with that. Let's go.
we are not going in unless Crosswhite fires first.
it's the safest path.
unless you're the first hostage Crosswhite decides to shoot.
someone want to tell me what's going on?
mayor bagshaw, I'm agent Lisbon with the CBI.
glad to hear it. Nail, what's the plan?
Flashbangs through the side window, move in through the back, - take Crosswhite out. - Get started on it.
an assault like that should be the last resort, not the first.
a half-dozen people, including my wife, are in that building with an armed lunatic.
I want them out. - I won't allow it. CBI has the authority here.
no. Not anymore. You're to work with us now.
if you don't believe me, talk to your boss. I already did.
Lisbon, it's a matter of taking the feelings of the locals into account.
sir, this is a matter of people not getting killed.
you'll do your best to prevent that, I trust.
I can't if I don't have the authority.
now I know mayor Bagshaw has a lot of influence, but
no, there's no "but." all right? Influence has influence.
I don't have texexpln the politics of this to you, do I?
sir, this isn't about politics.
everything's politics, Lisbon... One way or another.
try persuasion. Works wonders.
what's the word? - We're on our own.
no, you don't want them going in. We better do something. They're saddling up.
Teresa, I know you're busy, but I'm babysitting a bunch of reporters out there who'll take a minute whenever you've got one.
not now, Brenda. - Fine. Uh, let me know when you can.
wait a minute. One. Now.
great. Uh, anyone in particular? Or should I just pick somebody?
who do you think has the best access to director Bertram?
we're human beings. We have a right to use the bathroom.
there's one in the mayor's office, just right around that corner.
Hey, You're one of those cops from out of town, right?
uh, something like that, yeah.
are you, like, working on a plan to get us out of this?
Yes. Of course I am.
what are you doing?
well, I'm - I'm thinking. And waiting.
what are you, like, 5? A little patience here.
they're gonna come in, you know.
and it's gonna get all shooty. What's that gonna prove?
you know what? Don't put this on me.
you're like all the rest of them. You just decided I killed Amber.
s - same way they just decided I killed my wife.
well, more times than not, it is the husband that did it.
Yeah, well, I didn't.
there were break-ins all around the neighborhood.
this was a robbery gone wrong.
I mean, just because some camera says I was someplace when I wasn't.
no, they didn't even bother to-to- to look into the robberies.
that's not true.
what did you say?
we looked into those break-ins. It was just kids.
they turned on each other the moment they got arrested.
they're not killers. - Donna...
you said you weren't in the d. a.'s office.
no, I-I just said I was a paralegal.
somebody killed my wife, and you were too busy blaming me to catch them.
I- I-I'm sorry I said anything. Please- Please don't shoot me.
I'm not gonna shoot you. I
well, waving the gun in her face is not a great idea.
everybody just needs to shut up!
look, I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry. Just please...
just stop it.
I can help her.
Yeah, please.
it's okay. It's okay.
just stand up. Breathe.
just come over here and take a seat.
you know the breath is the switch between the conscious and the subconscious mind?
it's how one controls the other.
just breathe.
just breathe and relax.
boss, we've tapped into the phones at city hall. You're gonna wanna hear this.
Lisbon. - Agent lisbon.
I just had a conversation with a reporter from the "examiner."
he seemed to know a lot about the situation in Crane creek.
now, I told him that no matter what any unnamed source might say, CBI puts civilian safety first and that we were not bowing to local pressure to do otherwise.
I also told him that authority in Crane Creek resides with our head agent in the field. You.
I've let Bagshaw and his chief know that you're in charge.
thank you, sir.
we'll discuss this again.
good luck, agent.
in... out. That's good.
in... Letting yourself relax.
in and out. Just relaxing.
what's he playing at?
sound like he's hypnotizing someone. - ... All the way.
breathing in and out. - Sir, we're ready to go.
stand down. No assault unless crosswhite starts shooting.
agent lisbon is in charge. - This is ridiculous.
it's done. Get back to your post.
relaxing your body...
in... And out.
relaxing your body. Let your eyes close.
that's good. That's good.
your mind is in fight-or-flight mode.
there's nothing you can do about that now, so just breathe in...
and out. Let it all fall away...
fall into the floor.
now, see yourself...
in a warm, safe place.
in... And out.
now you're drifting.
just drifting away.
they tried to kill me.
they tried to kill me.
I can't believe it.
they tried to kill me.
they tried to kill me.
close the blinds! Go!
stand down! Do not fire! Do not fire!
on the ground! Get on the ground! - Face down! Do it now!
well, what now? - You got me.
you could answer the phone.
well, that's gonna make it a little tricky to talk to 'em.
you're gonna talk to them.
okay.
we're gonna book you for attempted murder.
call your lawyer, your union rep, I don't care.
I'm the reason that Sutherland girl's dead. I wanted to make it right.
Cho, get him out of here. - Come on.
boss - Yeah, I know. We lost the phones inside.
no, no, no. It's jane.
don't shoot me.
Oh, Lisbon. Nice of you to show up. - Jane?
you know, you people ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
Crosswhite hasn't shot anyone, and you've shot Donna.
is she all right?
uh, for a shot person, yeah. She's fine. It's just a graze.
well, that was sergeant Rowley, acting on his own. - Says you.
look, Rowley's screwups have cost me enough.
if it wasn't for him, none of us would be here.
you're angry? How do you think he feels?
don't start to sympathize with him. - Who is Ronald Crosswhite?
he's a man that no one has listened to, a man that has been abused and pushed around.
it's hard not to sympathize with the man.
I do. I feel for him.
damn it! This isn't a therapy session! - No, it's not.
he says you got one hour to put him in touch with the governor and the attorney general, or he starts shooting hostages.
we'll get on that. In the meantime, could you ask him to please release the injured woman?
I never thought of that. That's a great idea.
not bad, CBI.
tell me you didn't kill your wife.
I didn't kill my wife.
hmm. You cheat on her? - no.
you kept some secret from her. - no.
Yes. There's something.
you just thought about it. What was it?
I... I - I was a smoker.
she hated it. You told her you quit, but you hadn't.
what did you do?
I... went for long drives, uh, clear my head...
snuck a smoke, figured what's the big deal, right?
that's what you were doing the night she died.
uh, I went for a drive, I listened to some music, had a few smokes.
came home, she was on the ground. There was blood.
put my hands to my face, smelled the smoke on my fingers.
the last thing I told her was a lie.
and that's the guilt you carry around.
I should have been there.
I should have been there with her.
have you ever considered that the killer was waiting for you to leave?
does that mean you believe me?
sure, I guess.
but taking us hostage to prove it is the dumbest idea you've ever had.
Donna... The security camera footage
the big evidence against mr. Crosswhite-who owned it?
uh, the el-electric company. - Perfect.
and Rowley's mistake- The one that got it thrown out
pretty stupid? Hard to anticipate?
of all the paperwork to forget, rowley picd the worst.
that'll do.
Crosswhite, forget about the deadline.
I will tell you who murdered your wife in 20 minutes.
I just need three things. - What?
first, donna here is injured. Let her go so she can be taken care of.
there's plenty of us here to shoot if that's what you feel like doing.
Hey, wha- - Second-I need to go to the bathroom.
Oh, me, too. - And me.
fine.
we all get to go to the bathroom. And third, I need a pen and some paper.
that's all you need to find my wife's killer?
Yeah. You think the governor can say that? I doubt it.
okay.
you okay to walk? - Oh, I'm fine.
tell Kenyon that I'm okay. Tell him-- No messages. Go ahead. Open her up.
Donna. Donna. So brave. Oh, so
Oh! Sorry. Forgot about your... - I'm all right.
my bad.
did Jane tell you to say anything? Give you a message?
no. He just gave me a hug.
a hug?
excuse me.
what's it say? - "hey, everybody. Solved the case.
saw envelope on mayor's desk left by Amber.
must be what the killer was looking for.
can't get to it right now. Yours truly, Jane.
P. s. - Lisbon, I'm not paying the ticket.
I don't know what the hell that means, but in ten minutes, the deadline's up.
Crosswhite said he's gonna start shooting people.
now, I don't care what you have on, Bertram.
if that psycho hurts my wife, I will break you.
your ball game, Lisbon.
so what happens now?
well, what happens now is, you and I take a walk outside.
are you crazy? - Easy as pie.
uh, they'll shoot me. - Not if I'm standing next to you.
I won't take that chance.
well, you can take the walk outside, or you can stay in here and wait for them to come in shooting.
personally, I like your chances out there.
I won't do it. I don't even know why I'm listening to you.
because I know what I'm talking about. You're on the edge, and I've been there.
it's a dark and lonely place, and I'm telling you, this is the way back.
and more than anything else, I'm offering you what you want
your wife's killer standing in front of you in chains.
now, if you go out there, there's a chance that you will see that, but if you stay in here, you will probably die.
this is just a trick. - Oh, I wish.
if this was a trick, I'd be a lot more confident.
this is 60/40 at best.
but what's plan "b," huh? You coming?
Oh, that's a lot of guns.
drop your weapon now!
you get crosswhite. We'll get the hostages out.
on your belly! Hands by your sides! Spread your legs and don't move!
you all right? - Right as rain.
easy, Rigsby. Easy.
well, looks like you had it wrong.
there was no envelope on the mayor's desk.
you're gonna wanna see this.
there's nothing there because you have it stuffed inside your bulletproof vest.
excuse me?
he killed Ginger Crosswhite, and he killed Amber Sutherland.
what possible reason could I have to hurt those women?
well, Ginger, I'm not so sure about yet, but Amber...
she found out, didn't she?
you got your killer right there.
Yeah, and you were terrified I was starting to believe him.
if he was telling the truth about what time he came home that night...
then the security footage doesn't make sense.
what do you mean?
well, it's unlikely the electric company meddled with it.
you had access to thidence and you changed it.
but what you didn't know is she left a message about what she found on the mayor's desk.
there was no envelope.
Yes, there was...
cause I put it there.
now let's see it.
chief Nail, take off your vest.
open it.
read it out.
arrest arrest me.
okay.
look at that, huh? You don't have to say that twice.
I'm not going to jail! - Don't do it!
that was close.
we have people looking at the security footage right now.
it's only a matter of time before they figure out what you did.
now you're a cop about to go into the sysme you do the math.
ginger Crosswhite got herself killed.
I want you to understand that.
we'd talked at city hall. She was not an innocent.
she married down. Anybody could see that - I certainly could.
it was clear as day that she was unhappy.
there was a connection between us. Very powerful one.
at least, I felt there was.
but she was gonna tell the world...
like I assaulted her.
Defiled...
like I was some disgusting... thing.
Where'd you get the video of Crosswhite?
I hacked into the security footage, changed the time stamp.
I had crosswhite cold.
and that idiot Rowley forgot to file the warrant.
so Crosswhite walked...
and lived in a purgatory you created for him until he met Amber, and she figured out that there was something wrong with the footage?
said the "meta-data" didn't match.
she had no idea I was involved.
and she said that she hadn't told anyone else, so I met her at her home.
and you took her cameras, and you planted one at Crosswhite's.
in for a penny.
I thought that...
when I confessed, I would feel a weight lift.
I don't feel anything.
Crosswhite. It's time.
Hey, uh...Sorry about the whole jail thing, but you did take a bunch of people hostage.
I don't care. Jail doesn't mean anything to me now.
Yeah, well, see how you feel about that in a couple years.
are you familiar with the regulations regarding agents giving anonymous statements to the press?
CBI employees shall not give anonymous or "off the record" statements to members of the media.
and what are the repercussions of said violation?
suspension or termination. - yes.
however, both the Bagshaws are happy.
everyone's alive. We caught the killer.
Yes, sir.
see, you-you find the right lever, agent, you can move the world.
you found the right lever. That was a smart play.
I hope you stay smart.
what was that about? - Oh, it was just business. What's that?
this-this is my speeding ticket that I refuse to pay.
well, I'm not paying it.
well, then I guess no one's gonna pay.
I'll get Bertram to pay it. - How are you gonna do that?
I have my ways.
it's on your desk!
feel alive!
agent lisbon?
Patrick jane, consultant.
hello. - Morning, sheriff.
Trey hughes. Thanks for coming.
it's, uh... - Tell us about the victim.
look- Uh- hawk. Family of haw- oh, they're gone.
Rick loomis - Been in town five months.
dead in his truck by the creek.
well, maybe he died of happiness- Too much natural beauty- Stendhal syndrome.
No...He was shot in the head. - no?
Oh, well. Never mind.
beautiful!
who found the body all the way out here?
another prospector saw loomis' body in the truck yesterday, thought he was sleeping.
then she came back this morning and saw him, and checked and saw he was shot dead.
a prospector, you say?
Yeah, for gold.
a guy discovered trace gold in these hills about a year ago, got on the tv news about it.
folks haven't stopped comin' ever since.
like a gold rush.
well, gold's over $1, 300 an ounce, and unemployment's at 12%.
got a lot of hard-nosed, well motivated folks here.
I don't blame 'em.
poor souls gonna be disappointed.
poor souls? There's no gold?
Oh, yeah, there's still some in the stream bed. Always has been.
but... It's enough to pay for your lodging, food, if you work hard to get it, but there's no el dorado here.
I tell 'em that, but they don't listen.
murder weapon?
nothin' yet.
Hey, fellas. How about you look around for the gun?
sorry, sorry, sorry.
sorry, sorry.
I didn't touch a thing.
our victim liked smooth jazz, yet his radio station was tuned to heavy metal, which suggests that the jazz-hating killer popped out the cd and found music more to his taste while he drove the truck over here, probably with the victim already dead in the back.
I'll have forensics st for prints.
excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me.
Hi, melinda.
that's melinda.
she's the one who found loomis' body.
Melinda drew.
um, you guys aren't gonna be much longer, are you?
I mean, no disrespect to the dead fella, but we're losing daylight.
we'll do the best we can.
ma'am, just stay behind the tape.
now when did you first see the truck?
uh, truck was here when I started work yesterday, around 6: 00 a. m.
and did mr. Loomis work up here often?
uh, no, I han't seen him around here in a while.
gold!
Hey, that's my equipment.
there's more!
CBI!
Oh, it's so cool!
that's mine! - Relax.
now, we're not gonna do anything.
that's no fair!
they're letting her in! - That belongs to me!
No! No, they are - Hey!
hold on, guys!
are you people insane?
Ow... My ankle...
I'm fine. I'm fine.
it's red. That's good.
how can red be good?
well, blue means torn ligaments and red means it's a sprain.
sprain can be as bad as a break.
it's not sprained.
let's focus here.
job, murder, talk to me.
CK loomis, 43, moved to hadley six months ago with his son and girlfriend.
lives in a trailer home near the gold panning creek.
we got something n the kill shot. Bullet was from a colt. 45.
a colt?
how wild westy. - Yup.
Plus, the lack of blood in the truck bed means jane was right.
the victim was shot somewhere else and driven to the creek.
any prints? - Only the victim's.
he's been dead awhile, the coroner says - Two days at least.
I'll head back to hadley, corral jane, go and see the girlfriend and the son.
the guy's gone for two days, and they don't report him missing?
Rigsby and I can go. You should stay off that ankle.
I'm fine. I'll go.
agent hightower, hi.
um, I heard you took a fall.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
so I pull out the topo map?
there's a creek running right through the claim.
I found a nugget the first day.
once you get that first hit, it's like a drug.
I mean, you just can't stop.
Yeah, sounds exciting.
so can I just show up and start panning or digging or what have you, or do I need a permit or a license or something?
check. - No.
all you got to do to stake a claim is find open public land, and then you got to mark it and register with the government and stuff.
5.0
I'll call that.
Wes attwood will sell you one that's already registered, too, if you want. It saves you time.
raise you $10.
okay, well... Uh, I'm gonna see your $15...
and I'm gonna raise you...
the same.
sheriff says there's nothing up there.
he says that you guys are just kidding yourselves.
Yeah, he would say that.
he would?
all these townspeople own claims up in these hills themselves, so...
exactly, and they want to keep it all for themselves.
I'm gonna call you.
stands to reason.
Oh-that's my ride.
well, folks, uh...
it's been fun, but... - What?
I have to go.
well, come on. You can't just leave.
we barely took any of your money.
two pair, busted flush, pair of jacks.
don't let us keep you.
Hey, lisbon.
but no. Hightower.
I didn't even know you had legs.
let's go.
what were you doing back there?
five card draw.
for money? - No.
for gold.
Oh, gold. - Gold. That makes it all right, then.
and gossip.
victim rick loomis was a former software developer.
came up here after he got laid off. His girlfriend is cheryl meade.
they've been together since his divorce.
Rick enjoyed working on his truck with his son jeff, age 17 and smart, but a little hostile.
you seem a little keyed up, madeleine.
something wrong?
something personal?
none of your business.
okay.
we're sorry for your loss, miss meade, jeff, but we need to know why you didn't file a missing person's report for rick.
well, rick had been, uh, mining off the grid recently, away from his regular claim near the creek.
sometimes my dad would be gone for a few days and he'd never call to let us know.
good school.
how's it been going - Your dad's gold claim?
great at first...
then nothing but mud.
it would have come good eventually. He would have hit pay dirt.
Wes attwood sell him that claim?
Yeah. mr. Attwood.
did, um, rick carry a gun with him when he would go off by himself?
no. Rick didn't believe in guns.
he didn't think guns existed?
he didn't like them.
me neither. Terribly dangerous.
have you seen the statistics on police shootings?
one bullet out of every ten hits a bad guy.
and that's the trained people. No offense.
this is not useful. Can I go now?
Yeah, sure.
it was rick's idea to come out here, wasn't it? To follow the gold dream.
when rick had a passion, there was no stopping him.
I loved that about him.
but you had to give up a successful career of your own.
high-end sales type of business.
following momee e se's dream must be, uh...
at times, a little frustrating.
we all made sacrifices.
Jeff put off going to college.
Rick raided the college fund, did he?
Yeah. We're broke.
okay, we're flat broke. But...
we had each other.
Cheryl, look at me.
there's no need to pretend, and I mean that in the nicest possible way, but there's a whole lot of guilt in there with that grief, and just a smidgen- Just a smidgen-of relief.
right?
were you cheating on loomis?
no. no! - Patrick.
okay, just a thought.
you're guilty about something.
where were you on monday night when he was murdered?
I was at the diner, waitressing.
I can't believe that you think that I would hurt him. - All right. Okay.
I'll be leaving right now.
sorry.
there was no reason to treat her disrespectfully.
I was probing her. A certain amount of disrespect is necessary.
it's, uh... It's like getting frisked at the airport.
probing. All right.
okay. Well, she did seem like she was hiding something.
I'll get the team to look into her financials while we talk to sheriff hughes.
well, that sounds fun. I bet there's a good diner in town where you can drop me off.
I bet there is. Why don't I do that?
tell a lot about a place by the quality of the eggs.
Ehecked to the bank records.
victim had an account with his girlfriend, all of $88. 32.
here's the thing.
Cheryl meade - She had a separate account, her name only, over 5 grand.
the girlfriend?
she told hightower she was flat broke. - She lied.
Cheryl meade also bought a one-way ticket to san francisco a week ago.
well, maybe she wanted to put some distance between herself and a dead boyfriend.
Rick loomis recently bought a gun.
colt. 45, same make as the murder weapon.
girlfriend told hightower loomis didn't own one.
so either she knew about it or sh - or she's lying about that, too.
well, let's bring her in here.
don't worry, boss. We already got it covered.
l just stay here and, um...
not do anything.
Hello? mr. Attwood?
anyone home?
I'm wes attwood. How you doing?
you're the police, right?
well, more of a hobbyist.
Patrick jane. Your assistant told me where to find you.
Hey, I'm dean puttock.
nice to meet you.
after I sell you a claim, dean will sell you anything you need to find gold.
sluices, high-bankers, pans...
he's the go-to guy.
that's right. We got a 10% off sale on pumps all week long, so...
good to know.
Yeah. I got to get back to the shop. You guys need anything, let me know.
okay. Good seeing you. Nice to meet you.
nice to meet you, too, dean.
Hey, you folks mind if I join you?
just to get a feel for the place?
uh... I don't know.
Wes, we're the customers, right?
sure thing, sonya, but...
the more, the merrier, mr. Jane.
just showing jack and sonya here a claim I have for sale.
watch and learn.
all right.
all right.
you knew rick loomis, didn't you? The, uh, miner that died in the park?
Yeah. Yeah, I sold loomis a claim when he first got to hadley.
real tragedy. Nice guy.
so it's the bends in the river where you're gonna find the gold, you see?
okay. Okay.
it's heavier, so it falls into the silt.
you just got to wash the silt away...
what do you see there?
Oh, my god. Jack, gold. - Oh, my god. Oh, my...
I wonder what it's worth.
did you know only 10% of the gold iththsierra nevadas was found during the original gold rush?
billions of dollars are out there...
just waiting to be discovered.
can I see?
um... Yeah.
Yeah. - It's cool.
Yeah. Hey, wes...
want to try just here?
how about we let the new owners pan over there?
well, I'll take it.
hang on, pal.
we get first dibs.
dibs? What are we? Children?
I'm just kidding. It's all yours.
do you have another claim you can sell me?
Yeah, I do have other claims, you know?
yeah? - Great spots, but, uh...
aren't you here on police business?
Yeah. So?
it doesn't mean I can't mine for gold.
do whatever I want.
okay. Sure thing. - Cool.
I got another super-hot site.
black sand and quartz all up and down the bed stream.
black sand and quartz - That's the good stuff, isn't it?
Yup. This is the site for you. - Oh, yeah.
it's up the creek there about half a mile.
and where are we here? - About here.
okay. So can we go take a look at it now?
you know, I'm kind of jammed today, but, uh...
what do you say I meet you in the parking lot bright and early tomorrow morning?
say, 8:00 a. m?
tomorrow at 8: 00 a. m. In the parking lot.
look forward to it. - Good.
Yeah, well, good luck to you.
Oh, I won't need luck.
I'm feeling the gold.
I feel rich already.
you take it easy. - Yeah.
that's the spirit. - I'llee you later.
good. All right. - 8: 00 a. m.
Rick owns a colt. 45. Where is it?
a gun?
Rick?
what would rick need a gun for?
you also told us you were broke, but you have $5, 000.
that's not broke.
that's my money, and you can't touch it.
we don't plan on touching it.
Where'd you get it?
waitressing.
$5, 000 tucked away.
and you booked a seat on flight 465 to san fran for this morning.
no. I mean...I mean, ye
I booked that a week ago.
before he died.
exactly.
it looks like a plan.
some plan. I didn't go, did i?
why not?
because I knew it would look bad.
why were you planning on going?
cause I was...
leaving rick. I couldn't take it here anymore.
did rick know that?
no. Rick was blind to everything but the gold.
he's been like that ever since we got here.
he-he would find a little nugget, and he would get all excited and come running in, saying, "we're rich. I hit the mother lode.
the first three times, I believed him, and then after the 20th time, I couldn't take it anymore.
look, I loved him.
I did.
but I fell in love with a regular guy with an apartment and a job and clean clothes, not some obsessive scratching in the dirt.
but I need you to know I'm - I'm not a bad person.
I don't make that kind of evaluation.
uh, excuse me, sir.
do you know which store is wes attwood's?
Yep.
you want to tell me?
right there.
thank you.
course, it's not open right now.
of course.
do you know how I can contact him?
Yep.
uh, you don't want to get her mad.
she's, uh, stressed enough already.
where have you been?
in the diner.
not when I went by there several hours ago.
good eggs.
two loosely scrambled on toast is the test, and these were just so.
then I took a nice walk in the countryside.
you know, there's no cell phone range in these hills, which I find very refreshing.
I am going to go see wes attwood.
perhaps you'll join me?
you're really committed to keeping your temper contained, huh?
what's up with that?
you're really committed to testing my temper, huh?
what's up with that?
idle curiosity.
what-what are you doing?
I'm hiding from wes attwood.
Why?
because we're gonna follow him.
okay.
what's he doing?
he's trying to defraud me.
his shotgun is filled with gold flakes.
he's salting the claims he sells to make 'em appear richer.
I told you lay down the gun, lay down the gun-ok. ok. Don't shot. I will not resist.
turn around - ok, ok. It's a mistake,and you can't handcuff me because I didn't commit a crime. First, you threat the police with a gun-That's too much-You are motivated.
gold in a shotgun cartridge.
clever.
Mr. Attwood, let me lay it out for you.
looks to us like rick loomis caught you salting the gold claims.
he would have been plenty mad.
you would have had to kill him to keep him quiet.
Hey, now, I didn't kill anybody.
I mean, i'm a killer salesman, but...
you know, I'm not a killer.
ask yourself whether this is the right moment for humor, Mr. Attwood.
I am a seller of hope.
I was simply helping folks visualize the future.
great marketing is not a crime.
and I wouldn't murder anyone to cover it up.
we'll see.
we can hold you on the fraud charges and see about the murder as we go.
Oh, come on.
I can have a lawyer here in half an hour. Be reasonable.
there's plentyf f ople that could have killed that guy.
fraud alone can get you ten years, depending on the judge.
have you even checked into the sneak thief that's been targeting miners, stealing their equipment?
loomis got hit ten days ago.
bastard cleaned him out.
that's who killed him, I promise you.
if that's true, I wonder why sheriff hughes didn't tell us about it.
that's why I hate these small town investigations.
you never know if the guys have done the math.
I'm gonna follow up with hughes.
you good?
screw it. You go. - Yeah.
why rob loomis and then kill him ten days later?
maybe loomis found out who it was that stole from him and confronted him.
Yeah. That must be what happened.
something you care to share?
no. Sorry, just a funny thought, is all.
can I go now, or are you gonna charge me?
I'll let you know.
all right. That's odd.
okay. Well, charge wes attwood with fraud, if he can post bail, let him go, and put a name to this local thief.
all right.
okay, so sheriff hughes confirms that there has been a string of equipment thefts.
but he says that rick loomis never filed a police report.
why not, we wonder?
let's go talk sluice pumps.
so you play bad cop.
I'll be me, thank you.
right. Exactly what I said.
funny. So funny.
I hit a big one.
they're huge.
you cashing in?
hell, no! Just when I hit good dirt?
Nah. I'm buying a better pump and foot valves.
Hey, Mr. Jane. How ya doin? - Good. How are you?
good.
Oh, this is, uh, special agent hightower.
we believe rick loomis bought some, uh, new mining equipment from you after his old equipment had been stolen.
Yes, he did. He was in here, I'd say, about nine days ago.
what did he buy?
whole bunch of stuff. He spent over 10 grand.
maybe we could see an invoice?
Yeah. Give me a second. I'll pull it up.
um, would you mind terribly if I held one of your, uh, your nuggets in my hand?
Mm...Sure, I guess. - Thank you.
Thanks.
the g-force rock crusher...
and a series 54 pulverizer?
man. I wish I had one of those.
that's the best for hard rock mining.
Yep. That's some good gear for sure.
hard rock mining - is that in the creek?
no, no. Creek panning's a whole other thing.
hard rock-it's like it sounds. Uh, dry mining up in the hills.
did he mention to you that his mining equipment had been stolen?
he didn't. He said that he got sick and tired of panning. Wanted to try something new.
seemed a little bit like a hail mary desperation kind of play to me.
but hey, chasing his dream, you know?
he never did have any patience.
you know...God rest his soul.
right. Thank you.
you got me. Worth a try.
sorry, ma'am.
Hello? - Ma'am? Rigsby.
so, we may have found our thief.
Scott munroe. He's a townie with a long rap sheet - Assault with a deadly weapon, and-wait for it- Stealing mining equipment.
got out of prison six months ago.
good work. Scott munroe. You got an address?
Yeah, I'm gonna send it to you
Rigsby? An address?
uh, y-yes, ma'am. Your...Kids are here?
what?
ma'am? Your, uh, husband had to go somewhere, I guess.
he left mimi and will with jean at the front desk.
damn. Damn. Damn.
lisbon here.
listen, don't worry.
we can look after them until you get back.
Lisbon, thank you.
I appreciate it, truly.
I, um... Thank you.
may I have a word with mimi, please?
all right. It's your mom.
Hi, mommy. - Hi, baby.
you okay?
look, I'm gonna be back in a few hours, but I want you to, uh, be a good girl, and I want you to listen to what ms. Lisbon says, and I want you to look after your brother, okay?
okay.
Mimi, I love you.
Bye. - bye.
so, uh... Who's scott munroe?
local mining equipment thief.
excellent. Let's go talk to him, shall we?
thanks for not asking questions.
Oh, no need to ask questions when you know all the answers.
So...Cookies?
okay.
are you disabled? - No. No, I'm injured.
not that disabled is bad, but I'm not. I'm injured.
you walk like disabled.
so, no questions, but, uh...
we can talk if you want.
talk about what?
I'll take that as a no.
Yes. No.
we are CBI.
is it...Scott munroe?
no. Wes attwood. Gold claims dealer.
that's odd. - odd?
it's sad, too, but I'm...
I'm just saying it's odd...
it's not scott munroe.
Where's mimi and will?
tearing up paper in my office.
what's going on with munroe?
well, we've got a bolo out, and sheriff hughes is putting up roadblocks.
Hadley's pretty much on lockdown.
why would munroe kill attwood?
well, maybe he was conducting an investigation of his own.
you know, trying to figure out if munroe killed loomis.
found out the hard way.
Rigsby.
no, don't move in. You'll scare him off. We're leaving now.
Munroe's been spotted in a local bar that his cousin works at.
go. Both of you.
Hey, boss.
no, they're fine.
y - yeah.
all right. Hold on a second.
look at this! Excellent work, guys.
now we are gonna take this paper and put it in these bags.
but first, say hi to mommy.
Hi, mom.
Hey, mommy, guess what?
we're tearing up paper.
tearing up paper?
okay. All right.
well, mimi, eat all your snack, okay?
all right. I love you.
give the phone back to, um, agent lisbon for me.
okay.
you're sending rigsby and van pelt?
okay, great. Keep me apprised on monroe.
all right. Thanks. bye.
chamomile tea - Excellent for repressed anger.
I'm not angry. - Sure, you are.
letting it out would be helpful, I guarantee it.
shout. Scream. Hit something, preferably not me.
it'll do you wonders.
you only think you know all the answers, patrick.
you don't.
you're getting a divorce.
and now your husband is acting out.
he just showed up and left the kids with you.
how'd you know I was getting a divorce?
your posture. The look in your eyes.
your wedding ring-it's gone.
you've been having trouble for years.
trying to make it work for the kids.
Plus, uh, everyone in the office knows. Water cooler talk.
depends on who you're speaking with, you cheated on him or he cheated on you, - and you've just had enough, so - okay.
okay.
let's keep the focus on the business at hand, okay?
why would munroe first kill loomis, and then attwood? What's-what's the connection?
my question is this - Why did the killer shoot loomis and then drive the body all the way to the creek?
well, not to hide the body.
he left it in plain sight, so...
he didn't want the body found at the kill site.
exactly. Why not?
van pelt and rigsby are gonna pick up scott munroe.
we'll ask him.
club soda, please.
how about something a little stronger?
I'm buying.
Oh, hey. Scott, right? Scott munroe?
Yeah.
that's funny,'cause I've been looking for you.
later, bitch. - What the hell - what She's a cop. - Yeah. Me, too.
up against the wall.
Theresa? - Yes, mimi?
I'm done with my math homework.
good work.
did you check it?
no. - Check it, please.
okay. After homework, can we watch tv?
Nope. - We got monroe.
you two stay here.
after you finish your homework, you can have another snack. They're on my desk.
need some help?
and then tv?
and then agent rigsby will tell you a story.
Mr. Munroe, tell us what happened with loomis and attwood.
I have no idea, except they're dead.
Yeah, attwood was dead on the floor of your trailer.
man, this is a frame-up. Maybe I should be talking to my lawyer.
that's your right, of course.
but this doesn't need to be adversarial.
just clear a few things up for us.
what do you wanna know?
we're told you're the top thief in hadley.
you specialize in gold mining equipment.
we hear you're the best at it.
it's good to be the best at something, right, scott?
that stuff holds up its resale value real well.
and you killed attwood because he found out you killed loomis.
you killed loomis beuse e heound out you stole his equipment.
Hey, you know who stole loomis' equipment?
his own kid, jeff.
Yeah. I'm blowing your mind, right?
the kid came to me last week to unload the stuff.
I bought the whole lot for a hundred bucks.
cold little bastard.
call hightower.
your father's mining equipment was recently stolen.
do you know anything about that?
no.
so it wasn't you who stole your father's equipment?
no. It's not true.
Oh, come on, jeff. You were mad at him.
we get it. - I wasn't mad at him.
he cleaned out your college fund and you weren't mad at him?
that's a...Little odd, jeff.
talk to us, jeff. Help us make this right.
my grandparents gave me that money.
if he had just asked me, I would have said sure, but he tried to hide it from me.
so you got even by stealing his panning equipment?
did your father find out?
Oh, he knew it was jeff all along. That's why he didn't call the police.
did you two get into a fight?
Jeff, what happened?
what happened?
he wasn't even mad.
he said he was sorry...
about the college money, about everything. He promised to make it up to me.
I didn't wanna listen to him, so I walked out.
and that was the last time we ever spoke.
well, that's too bad.
but I imagine owning a gold mine will ease the guilt. Do you have a map of the area?
huh? - A map.
I think the "huh?" was for the gold mine part.
Yes.
uh, jeff, what did your dad stop doing recently?
washing himself?
no. Something else.
uh...what did your dad stop saying recently?
he stopped saying...
that he found a gold mine.
Yes.
which could only mean...
that he found a gold mine.
Really? - Really.
and jeff is gonna tell us where it is.
I am? How?
Hey, guys. Can I help ya?
Yes. Uh, we need to look at a large-scale map of the hill country.
got one right there on the table.
okay. Thank you.
your father found gold, jeff.
he knew you and cheryl wouldn't believe him.
he'd disappointed you so many times before, so he wouldn't tell anyone, not a soul.
not until he had that real gold to put in your hand.
he told you nothing.
he wanted to.
badly. And subconsciously, he did.
subconsciously, he told you exactly where that gold is.
so where is it? - Yeah, where is it?
honestly, I don't have any idea.
you and your father were close, weren't you?
you loved one another?
Yes. - yes. You had a connection.
you know a lot more than you think you know.
let's take a look, shall we?
give me your hand.
this is for your father. Trust me.
I need a physical connection to get a good reading, please.
all right. - Thank you.
now we're working together. That's nice.
now, just relax. Relax. - All right.
what I'm doing is scanning his unconscious, measuring his affinity.
narrow it down...
you narrow it down...
to a more specific area.
what is? - Jane?
Yes.
you said,"uh-huh. Interesting."
Yes, I did. Uh, I thought I was getting a location, but, uh...
I was wrong. It's not an exact science, what I do.
no kidding.
well, uh... I need to go and get me some eggs.
but what about the gold mine?
disappointing, I know, but, uh, you seem like a smart young man.
I - I think you'll do fine.
Hi, dean.
Mr. Jane. I'm impressed.
you found it.
you really did scan that kid's unconscious, or whatever.
no, that'd be magic.
so, then, how?
well, I watched you watch the boy's hand on the map, and got a general direction, then I waited for your truck to go by and I followed you here.
it was you that led me to the gold.
don't feel bad.
I assure you, better men than you have been taken.
how'd you know it was me?
Rick loomis preferred smooth jazz.
you like the heavy metal. - so?
so your disdain for mellow saxophone solos has cost you dearly.
did rick loomis tell you he'd found a seam, or did you just follow him on the off chance?
look, Mr. Jane, with all due respect, my family has been up here in hadley mining since the first gold rush.
that gold belongs to me.
to my family, not to some newbie like loomis.
poor wes attwood. He figured out the killer was you, didn't he?
tried to blackmail you, get a cut of that gold.
Hey, you believe the nerve of that guy?
greedy bastard.
you do hear the irony there, right?
Yeah, when I heard you cops were lookin' for scott munroe, that made it easy.
I make it look like munroe killed attwood, and I'm off the hook for all of it.
splendid plan.
you know, the only thing standing between me and my gold now, Mr. Jane...
is you.
any time, madeleine.
drop it, puttock!
no, screw that! You drop yours.
drop it!
son of a bitch.
Seriously?
is he dead?
Yeah.
you know, I should applaud your bravery, but I gotta say, practically speaking, I- I...
what were you thinking? You could have killed me!
I'm sorry. I got mad. I didn't know what I was thinking.
that was some good shooting, though. That...
leg shot that took him down was v-very precise.
I was aiming for his head.
Oh, fantastic.
Hey, jeff.
I hear your mom's flying in.
Yeah, from fresno. I'm picking her up in the morning.
kind of nervous about it. It's been a while.
buy her some flowers. Moms like flowers.
and you can afford a good bunch.
we had that sent over from the bureau of land management.
you father was in the process of filing a mineral rights claim to the area where he struck gold.
he named you and cheryl as co-owners.
you own half a gold mine.
wow, I...
you father came through in the end.
thanks for, uh...You know.
you're welcome.
Hey, uh, will you, um...Thank Mr. Jane for me?
will do. Will do. Good luck to you, jeff.
Thanks.
I hope they weren't too much trouble.
not at all.
I had three nearly feral brothers.
your kids are sweethearts.
thank you.
not a problem.
let me get 'em out of your hair.
hello. Hello. Hello.
get up! Get up! Come on.
give me some sugar.
it was okay, then?
case closed.
what was it like?
it"?
you know...
you mean going out with another woman?
Yeah. No.
Uh-come on. You know what I mean.
it was great.
it's fun, intense, um, challenging.
she's super dynamic. Yeah.
I think we had a great connection.
that's great.
what, you a little jealous?
where have you been?
hunting and gathering.
Ah. The victim's name is timothy hartley.
he was killed sometime last night.
he was shot in the chest, and then his throat was slit. - Charming.
his ID Says he's from about a hundred miles away from here-Hillsborough.
no sign of what he was doing up here.
sheriff says hartley's car's down the road. I'll check it out.
all right.
you tell him? - Tell him what?
coroner's office sent steiner.
Dr. Steiner?
and we all know how much you like to make fun of Dr. Steiner, - so don't, okay? - I don't know what you're talking about.
no humoring yourself at his expense. - Is he that way?
top of the morning to you, Steiner.
you're looking trim.
curiously considerate killer.
slit his throat after the shots to put him out of his misery.
three steps back, please.
what?
please maintain a distance of at least three steps from the body.
Why?
because this body is a no-jane zone.
it will not be a playground for you.
you will not touch it or sniff it or place playing cards on it or borrow it for an interrogation.
if you do, a deputy will remove you. Clear?
that's a little harsh, no?
you have driven me to desperate measures.
well, I'm nothing if I'm not respectful of my fellow crime-fighters.
but I can see everything I need to from here anyway.
Really? You...
what exactly do you see?
he's in money, but not a banker, Something more aggressive， stocks or such, social drinker, Increased his intake lately, So under some pressure.
a registered, uh, independent, though always votes republican.
and as much money as he has, his wife has more.
ridiculous.
he chose the tasteless tasseled loafers.
she bought the opal-enlaced sterling silver cuff links.
guesses.
you might as well say he's going to meet a tall, dark stranger.
that's very unlikely, doctor.
he's dead.
and by the way, it looks like there's something In his left-front pant pocket.
you are about to think,"what the hell"?
how did jane... Do that?
how did you do that?
there are more things in heaven and earth, horatio， than dreamt of in your philosophy.
okay. You planned ahead.
you asked one of the sheriff's deputies to call you
the next time steiner was on a case and then you asked them to plant the note.
that is an absurd theory.
you know this means another apology at the coroner's office.
no, it doesn't. - Yes, it does.
Steiner loves the attention.
what happened? Where are they?
robbery.
two guys in a pickup pulled the coroner's van over and held it up.
What'd they steal?
get this-- your vic's body.
Hartley's corpse? - That's right.
Steiner tried to stop them, believe it or not.
Dr. Steiner.
agent lisbon.
it's not as bad as it looks.
go get yourself checked out and then come talk to us.
Jane, was this you?
w-- another trick?
Jane had nothing to do with this, nothing at all.
you didn't, did you?
of course not. - Swear on your life?
on your life, even.
damn it. Who steals a body?
interesting.
the pickup was...
pulled over.
there were two men, apparently working on the engine.
they flagged us down, For help, we thought, and then they pulled out guns.
can you describe them?
they were both white, A little under 6 feet, i think.
I can't really say much more.
they wore hooded s-- jackets and sunglasses.
one went to the van and dragged the body bag out.
the one guarding us went to help him, and...
that's when I...intervened.
foolish.
for once, I agree with you.
they put the body into the truck and they--they took off.
why would anyone do this?
we don't know yet. It's early.
I have to take this. I'm sorry. Thank you for your time, Dr. Steiner.
of course.- Good-bye again.
Mr. Jane.
it wasn't your fault.
excuse me?
they had guns.
big, scary guns. There's nothing you could do.
the body is my responsibility, my reason for being here.
now I have no reason or responsibility.
there's nothing for me to do.
I don't expect you to understand Why that feels like failure to me, but it does.
want a cup of tea?
I don't think so.
suit yourself.
I like the chapel in yountville.
it's just a long way for the guests to go.
what did you find out about vandermeer state park?
I love that place.
I see.
well, i guess we'll just keep looking.
I love you. Bye.
vandermeer state park-- Beautiful for a wedding.
I've hiked there.
there's an old quaker meeting hoe.
Oh, it would be perfect, But i guess they don't allow weddings.
it's too hard on the ground vegetation.
what do we have on hartley?
Jane was right. He was in finance.
ran a hedge fund called the h. v. Wilder fund.
but his wife's family has the real money. Name's cook.
the cooks?
Yeah, i guess. Wife's name is peregrine.
I'll deal with the family.
you go and talk to the people he worked with.
anything on the missing corpse?
forensics found no usable prints on the van And nothing from the tire tracks at the scene.
why steal a dead body? What can they use it for?
got me.
go and have Another talk with the two guys that were with steiner.
get any details on the thieves or the truck.
van pelt, look for any similar crimes, bodies that were stolen from hospitals, ambulances, anything.
good luck with the cooks.
Yeah, nothing like telling people Their loved ones are dead,
and oh, by the way, we lost the corpse.
none of this makes any sense.
the last time i-i spoke to tim, he was telling me some stupid joke he heard at work, happy as can be.
who's responsible, agent?
my son-in-law didn't just disappear. Someone is accountable.
who?
ma'am, we don't know yet. We're doing the best we can.
not good enough.
mother!
my dear, when they tell you they're doing their very best, that's exactly what they aren't doing.
hell of a place you've got here.
Where'd you get the money for it?
excuse me?
the moolah. The scratch. The shekels. The dollarinis.
what does that have to do with anything?
obviously something you're embarrassed about.
sugar beets.
sugar beets?
my, uh, my grandfather grew them.
I love sugar beets.
there's no shame in sugar beets, elspeth.
Mrs. Hartley, we found your husband's body A hundred miles from here.
any idea what he was doing out there?
uh, no, none at all.
was there anything out of the ordinary Going on in his life?
troubles at work? Changes in his schedule?
no. We started...talking about having...a family... a while back.
there, there, dear.
if there are no more questions...
you didn't like your son-in-law, did you?
you found him vulgar despite his highfalutin job.
and you... You're frightened.
the body's disappearance alarms you in a very specific way.
what is that?
Harrison, please show our visitors out.
thank you. I'm good. Thanks. Thank you.
Oh, god. Why do these things happen?
how long have you and Mr. Hartley been partners?
Oh, uh, five years or so.
we were both interested in a fund That offered slightly esoteric financial instruments.
a hedge fund.
what we do is pretty complicated.
I don't want to bore you with the details.
as i understand it, you rely on a strategy That exploits mean reversion tendencies Of crosscurrent far forward rates.
is that right? - Yes.
what did Mr. Hartley do for the fund?
built it.
designed the strategy. Certifiable genius.
the best.
a fund like yours can lose people a lot of money.
any angry investors?
no, no, no.
recently, we've had excellent returns.
what about work?
did hartley have problems here?
"loved" is the word.
how about trouble at home? - No.
tim adored peregrine.
HE--HE--HE was a boy scout. He would never play around, wouldn't even think of it.
he's a straight... Straight arrow.
I see. - The straightest.
so nothing new from the guys with steiner, But it wasn't an entirely wasted journey.
I got scones.
I found something.
three other corpses have been stolen From vehicles leaving crime scenes over the past six months.
who caught the cases?
we did. Rigsby.
o'laughlin. Why is the fbi on this?
it's interstate. One of the corpses was taken in nevada.
you guys have a theory?
Yeah. We think the bodies are being sold at tissue banks.
tissue banks?
they harvest bone and tissue from the corpses, Then sell them to medical supply houses.
you're supposed to get permission from the family To sell the corpse, but these guys are skipping that part.
and tissue banks are regulated, So more likely the thieves are working with the funeral home.
they provide the bodies to tissue banks.
I put together a list of funeral homes in the area. We can start with that.
great, yeah.
Hey, rigsby, my boss asked me to come, You know, since i've worked with cbi before.
I'm not trying to get in your face is all i'm saying.
didn't think you were. - Okay, good.
okay.
Dr. Steiner, I presume.
what brings you back?
good news, actually.
a small amount of blood was recovered From the dirt under the body at the crime scene.
it contains two distinct d. n.a. Signatures.
the killer got cut, too.
Yes, probably while using a knife on the victim.
there's not enough blood for an i. d.But there could be more on the corpse.
interesting.
why did you come and tell me that in person Instead of calling?
I would like to assist in some small way, if that's all right.
okay. Let's go get you a gun, shall we?
kidding.
welcome. Come on.
look sharp, lisbon. We have a visitor.
Dr. Steiner? Can i help you?
well, actually, I-- Steiner's gonna be joining us for a while.
um... Okay. - What is all this mess?
it's hartley's calendar and phone records.
we're making a list of people he saw before he died.
Meh. Clerical work.
we need to figure out what the big secret is.
what big secret? - Yeah, what big secret?
the big, weird secret that the widow and the partner
and everyone won't tell us about Because it's too shameful to mention.
it's funny you should mention that.
he--he did have an appointment every week with no description.
Thursdays, 2:15 to 3: 30. No name, no address.
interesting. - Clerical work, huh?
touch. If i may, his car's g. p.s. Might have an address.
Yes, it might.
see? Useful already.
2729 hillview avenue.
this is the address in hartley's g. p.s.
okay, what's the game with steiner?
no game.
what's he doing here, then?
what are any of us doing here?
we don't bring guests on investigations.
maybe we should. A different mystery sleuth for each case.
well, if this is some gag you're pulling-- Not.
he asked if he could come along, and i said he could. All right? Tt's it.
we're building bridges, mending fences... - Ok.
planting seeds.
laying foundions. - Okay.
it's a medical blding.
G. p.s dentists, but stly shrks.
how do you know who to talk ?
any calls from his phone records to this address?
no, but we can check his bank records for payments.
Oh, we'd need a warrant for that.
I'd rather just start knocking on doors.
then we're gonna need more people. You'll have to clear that with admin.
okay, everybody, outside!
outside! Come on!
it's not a drill!
Oh, god. Why do you do things like this? - Hustle it out. Hustle it out. That's the way.
okay, come on. All of you.
Hello, ladies and gentlemen. My name is patrick jane. I'm with the cbi.
we are looking for the doctor who treated timothy hartley.
I know you have a doctor/patient confidentiality thing.
let's not worry about that right now.
would timothy hartley's doctor please raise his or her hand?
raise it on up.
I know it's one of you.
maybe to your right, Maybe to your left.
up, up, up, up with your hand. Bring it up.
okay, so no one has raised their hand.
that doesn't matter because I know that you, ma'am, are the person who we seek.
please come forward. Everyone else, thank you, and back to your quackery.
what's your name, ma'am?
Dr. Wendelyne mccormick.
and I won't discuss my patients Of the fact that someone is my patient.
we're investigating the murder of timothy hartley.
he was killed last night.
Oh, god.
um... All right.
how did you know it was me?
everyone else was looking around to see who it was, but you weren't, because you knew.
great. The fire department. I'll go talk to 'em.
tim had been in therapy for about four months.
he'd had a traumatizing experience That he wanted to work through.
what kind of an experience?
agent, can I get some assurance of discretion from you?
it's a sensitive matter to the people around him.
we can't promise anything.
very well.
about five months ago, He had an abduction experience.
excuse me?
he believed he was abducted by extraterrestrial beings...
taken to their ship, examined, and released.
kidnapped by aliens.
cool.
I was being lifted by the light, up and away. I couldn't do anything. I was just being.taken right to the ship.
it happened when hartley was driving home From a trip to reno.
we found a couple of these videos on his personal laptop, Some kind of diary of the event.
and once on the ship, there were beings all around me, small small. just ash gray. And there were a little taller ones, too-- they're the same color.
they were leaders, I think.
it just all feels so.
it feels so concrete, so real.
crazy.
he sounds sincere to me.
sincerely cuckoo.
I don't see any sign he's lying.
it cou be a dream that he experienced During a hypnagogic state.
that would make it true for him, But not objectively real.
exactly. I agree with him completely.
thousands of people say it's happened to them.
they can't all be crazy or lying.
I'm just saying you should keep an open mind.
you can't prove there aren't aliens.
that's true.
okay, the point is, the wife had to have known about this.
we need to talk to her again. - Yeah.
where are we with the body hunt?
we've identified eight funeral parlors
that had extensive legitimate dealings with tissue banks.
we're gonna start with them.
we're splitting the interviews With o'laughlin.
all right, let me know what you find.
okay.
watch the skies, grace.
tim told me as soon as it happened.
he said he met them in a field outside auburn.
where we found his body?
he kept going back.
he couldn't tell me why.
I mean, he knew it wasn't rational.
why didn't you tell us this before?
I got a call from art vella, Tim's partner.
he told me not to mention it, begged me.
he said it would be devastating for the business.
you believed your husband's story, didn't you?
that's why you were so scared when the body disappeared.
okay, okay. Listen to me.
my husband wasn't crazy.
okay? He wouldn't lie to me about something like that.
rubbish!
when someone tells you something contrary to fact, they are lying, full stop.
don't start, mother.
agents, my son-in-law was drunk or drug-addled or both.
as for this tabloid trash about men from mars...
ladies. - How can you say that?
ridiculous. Just ridiculous!
this is so like you, mother... - I've never heard such twaddle in my life...
so closed off and close-minded.
and he said it with a straight face. You honestly think...
ladies. Ladies, that's enough.
wait. What are you looking for?
Ah, yes.
you're a scotch man, right?
uh... Uh, yes. I...
Oh, no, no. I-i shouldn't.
you really should.
Cheers.
you know, don't you? - Excuse me?
you know that i'm sick.
why would patrick jane, of all people, Invite me to a fancy house
and put a first-rate scotch in my hand if he didn't know?
you've lost some weight-- 8 pounds.
Yes. 
your face is looking drawn.
you're taking some powerful medication.
I can see it in the pallor of your skin.
Yes.
I'm dying. I have a month... Most likely, maybe less.
I'm sorry.
thank you for the distraction.
well, it's always good to... Keep busy.
there's probably some, uh, havana cigars in that box there.
no. No, no. I... I couldn't. Could i?
well, you're right.
this is a good cigar.
the only other time That i had been in a room like this.
was to examine a man who died accidentally In the middle of an autoerotic ritual.
well, I bet he died with a smile on his face.
excuse me.
can I help you?
Yes.
why did you tell peregrine hartley To lie to us, sir?
I didn't tell her to lie.
I asked peregrine not to raise certain relevant information.
why'd you do that?
tim was the brain.
I handled clients, administration.
tim was the brain.
it's all about confidence.
if the investors hear about alien probes and whatnot, confidence goes right out the window.
then I assume you asked him not to talk about this.
constantly.
but Mr. Hartley was growing certain His experiences were real.
he must've wanted to talk about it.
we had some arguments about it.
bad arguments?
I didn't kill tim because he wanted to go public with his cuckoo story.
you need to talk to that U.F.O.fruitcake that tim met.
they're friends about a week, and then tim wanted nothing more to do with him.
I think he was trying to squeeze some money out of tim.
what's his name? - Kirk.
can you believe that?
is there any way you can keep this quiet?
I doubt it.
$2. 8 billion in assets.
we're going down because my partner thought he was kidnapped by little green men.
gray. - What?
the little men. They're gray.
thanks for your time. Appreciate it.
two down, two to go.
wanna grab some food?
Oh, there's an errand I wanna run. Give me half an hour. I'll catch up.
where you going? I'll take you.
you don't need to do that.
Oh, come on. How far is it?
it's a little ways. It's okay.
it's a wedding thing.
Oh, I see.
why don't I drop you off?
I'll grab something to eat, and then stay in the car, okay?
sure.
hello. - O'laughlin.
I tried grace. She didn't answer. - She's busy.
I've got something.
Gary wineman, funeral director.
mentioned tissue banks, and he got very nervous.
Mr. Wineman, these are my colleagues from CBI, agents rigsby and van pelt.
did agent o'laughlin mention what this was about, sir?
uh, some... bodies have been stolen that might have gone to a tissue bank?
no, that's the fbi's investigation. We're investigating a murder.
you didn't say anything about that.
I certainly don't know anything about it. - Well, I hope so, sir.
a case like this, anyone connected to it-- Even remotely connected-- is in big trouble.
best thing to protect yourself is very clear about what you know and what you've done.
um... Oh, god.
uh, look... W-we...
my wife had a baby girl, and we needed a little extra cash.
so I started selling bodies to tissue banks.
A-all-- all legitimate. I got permission every time.
but the banks always want more bodies, and my wife got pregnant again.
look, who came to you? - My cousin.
not a good person. He said that if we split the fee, he could provide bodies, no permission necessary.
all I have to do was dummy up paperwork, giving them false names.
did he bring you a corpse today?
no, no, no, no. But he has done this before With other funeral homes.
his name is owen melling.
I-I-I had no I-- - where is he now, sir?
Melling's done time for assault, armed robbery, and truck hijacking.
did the truck jobs with a buddy named jim matthews.
both are on parole. Melling owes 15 years, matthews-- 12.
and they know if they get picked up, they're violated back in.
it's good times.
we need to talk to you about a robbery this morning.
just wanna get some facts straight.
come down to the office, and we can explain.
Jim. Cops.
Jim matthews? - Yeah. What's up?
says it's about some robbery this morning. - So what? We were right here.
that's right. - Been here all day.
Yeah, well, we still need to talk to you.
now get your hands out of your pocket. Hands where we can see 'em.
you heard him. Now.
don't hassle my boy! He ain't done nothin'!
put the weapon down, ma'am.
you just wanna make more trouble for him. I won't have it.
we just wanna talk to your son. Everything's gonna be fine.
just put down the gun, ma'am. Please.
gun!
O'laughlin, grace is in trouble. Cover me.
grace, get down!
on the ground! Facedown! Now!
get on the ground!
how'd the interview with matthews go?
didn't. He asked for a lawyer.
What'd you find in melling's house?
no sign of hartley's body. Forensics is checking the pickup for d. n.a.
I got something. According to his cell phone records,
Melling made a call yesterday to a wellview funeral home.
could be where they dropped off hartley's body.
get steiner and go and check it out.
if the body's there, he's the one to i. d. it. - Sure.
tracked down an address for newsom kirk, the guy hartley had a falling-out with.
he runs an organization for abductees called the fourth kind foundation.
office is downtown. - Does he have a sheet?
running it now.
we'll go talk to him. Call if anything pops. - Okay.
newsom kirk, I'm agent lisbon.
this is agent cho. We're with the CBI. - Yes, yes.
welcome. Welcome.
agent cho, you-- you've-- you've been, haven't you?
excuse me? - Up. Taken, with them.
no.
well, I'm getting - I'm getting a definite sense.
it sometimes takes a person years to realize they've had the experience.
timothy hartley. - Of course. Sorry.
you met him through the foundation, right?
Yeah. We're here to serve abductees.
um, help them come to terms with their experience.
spread the word.
uh, Tim wanted to talk about what he'd been going through.
he asked us to keep it in confidence, and-- and we did.
and that's all you did-- talk about his experience?
no. As a matter of fact, Tim had a lot of money.
and frankly, we-- we need money,
we had-- we had several quite serious discussions about funding this.
this place. As a child...
did-- did you have, um, dreams where you were floating through the house as though pulled by an unseen force?
no.
uh, we heard that the, uh, two of you had some sort of a falling-out?
he decided that he wanted to start his own foundation.
uh, his right, I say.
it never got angry? - No, no.
uh, if you're looking for someone tim had a fight with, you should talk to that shrink of his.
uh, mccormick.
she wanted to write a book about him.
he said no. She was angry.
okay. - Boss, from rigsby.
uh, Mr. Newsom, is your real name garrett rosten?
and did you spend a year in china prison for fraud?
because your arrest record says you did.
in my previous life, I was garrett rosten, yes.
Mr. Hartley seems like the kind of guy who would research somebody If he was considering funding them.
did he find out about this?
I never hid garrett.
I'm simply a different person now. - Not that different.
there's a bench warrant out for your arrest for kiting checks.
we're gonna have to take you in. - Turn around, please.
it's-- it's okay. It's... Just a misunderstanding.
Hey, agent.
the important thing is that you take a look inside yourself.
and start questioning those experiences...
that you can't explain. - Never happened.
I believe you.
wake up.
newsom kirk posted bail. He's gonna be gone in an hour.
just in time for the 6: 10 to alpha centauri.
he was right about hartley's psychiatrist.
she did propose a book, but she withdrew it.
so she had motive. - Kinda.
who do you think did it? - Jabba the hutt.
seriously. - Ming the merciless.
okay. - Alf?
when the aliens do come, I hope they eat you.
Lisbon. - Theresa, brenda shettrick.
a local news crew is about to interview Dr. Steiner about the hartley case.
just thought you'd like to know.
he's supposed to be looking for hartley's body.
no, he's here. - What interview?
some background on tissue banks and the corpse trade.
there's a lot of interest. He offered to do it.
you didn't know anything? - I'll be right there.
Bye, lisbon.
the legitimate trade in tissue is a valuable source of biological material for medical use.
unfortunately, this illegal trade has halted the investigation Into the death of timothy hartley.
how's that?
well, I-I just came from a funeral home
where we had hoped to find Mr. Hartley's body.
and it's--it's-- it's not there.
the thieves have hidden it somewhere.
and there is crucial evidence-- blood evidence
on Mr. Hartley's body that will identify the killers.
Brenda. - If we don't find that evidence.
now. - Guys, that's it. Thanks very much.
did I do something wrong?
we don't talk to the press about evidence.
it kinda tells the killer what we're looking for.
sorry. How did I do otherwise?
Oh, good.
Hey, cho. - Yeah.
I think o'laughlin flaked on van pelt yesterday.
what do you mean?
well, he saw she was in trouble and he didn't do anything.
guess he was scared. - It happens.
Yeah.
van pelt doesn't know this? - No. I don't know.
the question is, does she need to know?
Yeah, it's tough. Your call.
you saw the news story on hartley's body?
well, I lied. I did find the body.
there is evidence on it, And it will convict you of murder.
but I haven't given the police the body.
I've kept it, and I'm willing to sell it, along with my silence, for $50, 000.
because I'm a dying man.
all I want is a few days of real comfort before I'm gone.
think about it. You know how to reach me.
how was that? - Not bad.
little over-the-top, But, you know, credible, nonetheless.
sorry.
still getting used to all this deception.
what deception? You did find hartley's body at a funeral home.
Yes, but there was no blood evidence on it.
you can't catch a fish without bait.
we will tell agent lisbon what's going on, yes?
Oh, yeah, eventually.
agent lisbon's a good person.
she reminds me of...
never mind.
showtime. Huh? Let's go.
yes?
testing one, two. Testing two.
Yes, Dr. Steiner, we can hear you, just like before.
I'm a little nervous.
you're doing a great job. You look the part.
are you sure about this?
are you ever gonna tire of asking me that? - No.
someone's coming.
go.
Dr. Steiner?
put your hands where I can see 'em! Hands! - I'm not armed.
hands in the air! - I'm-- i'm not armed. I'm not armed.
it's the butler! It's the butler! It's the butler! It's the but-- the butler did it!
I always wanted to say that. But wait. It gets better.
ms. Cook. Good evening. Remember me?
I can't hear anything with this.
the good doctor here told us that timothy hartley's murderer.
cut himself whilst doing the killing. Yeah.
would you mind terribly showing me your hand?
you must let harrison go.
he has done nothing but serve me faithfully and well.
as I explained, ma'am, our d. a. will drop the charges against your butler, if you answer our questions honestly.
I feel like I'm haggling in a bazaar over the cost of a rug.
but if you will release harrison, then I will speak.
your son-in-law was about to go public with the whole alien adventure thing, wasn't he?
more than that.
he wanted to start a global foundation for abductees.
to see to their needs and promote their cause.
he was gonna call it the cook family foundation.
well, that wasn't going to happen.
you cannot do this. I won't allow it.
it's not something you can stop.
try me. I am not without resources, young man.
but he said he was going to use his own money for it.
and then he said... - Time's on my side, elspeth.
what do you mean, timothy?!
Timothy, come back here!
I knew what he meant.
Hartley was going to wait until I was dead, and then use my money and my daughter to turn the cook name Into an international joke.
so the next time he went to that place he was always visiting, we followed.
why slit hartley's throat?
that was the telltale sign-- A hunter's humanity, if you will.
you learned how to hunt and kill at a young age, Didn't you, elspeth?
your father taught you.
Yes. He was very firm on that point.
"never let the animal suffer."
I got awfully cross with consuela for mislaying this.
I shall have to apologize.
what's up? - There's something i have to talk to you about.
what's that? Wayne? What is it?
a friend of mine is a ranger at vandermeer state park.
and maybe I can get him to give you a waiver to get married at that quaker meeting house.
Really? - Yeah. I think. I can try.
Wayne, that's fantastic. Thank you so much.
Yeah. - I'm gonna call craig.
Yeah, okay.
please. Thank you for coming by.
Oh, it's no problem. Nice place. Tidy.
thank you. Please.
I wanted to tell you how much I appreciated.
your letting me come along on your investigation.
it was fun.
hmm, it was fun, wasn't it? That was my pleasure.
thank you. - Um, look...
won't beat around the bush.
about me dying, I-I know what's going to happen now.
I've seen it. There are no mysteries.
it's going to get bad...
very soon, and then worse.
and I have no interest In letting nature take its course.
you understand? - Uh, yes.
you, uh, you want to kill yourself. - In a nutshell.
I have pills I can take.
the problem is, if there is an unexplained death, if a body is found in an apartment, there is an investigation, an autopsy.
and the idea of being examined, of being a body on the... On the table...
but if the death is witnessed by a law enforcement officer, no investigation is required.
I'm not a law enforcement officer.
you're close enough, i think.
I don't know that I can do it, that I can witness that.
I'm not even sure that killing yourself is the best idea.
it's what i'm going to do.
well, that's your choice.
but, uh...
I understand. I... I'm sorry.
this was a t-- terrible imposition.
I-I shouldn't have. Please. Forget I said anything.
I'm sorry.
do you have any tea?
Yes, I do. - I could really use a cup of tea.
okay.
sure.
there's cookies in the cupboard. - Yeah.
uh, would you like a cup?
thank you. - Yeah.
well, uh, I'm going in the other room now.
I'll be a few minutes. - Yeah. Take your time.
here.
the note in the dead man's...
you-- you had an arrangement With the deputy, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
I knew it. - Yeah. It's an old carny magic trick.
you did magic? - Oh, yeah.
I first started out, uh, working close-up With, uh, cards and coins.
Really? - Yeah. I'll show you.
got a coin in here. Yeah. Okay.
see that coin? It's there, right?
and it's gone.
it's there...
then it's gone.
amazing. - It's really quite simple.
it's there...
and then it's gone.
Patrick... Thank you.
just watch the coin. And it's gone.
it's there...
and then it's gone.
victim's name is John Flynn.
he's 48, married-- Cho's bringing the wife now-- and c. e.o. of a company called Symphony.
symphony?
web site says it's a high-end matchmaking service.
rich old men looking for hot young chicks?
Yep.
Flynn was shot twice in the chest at close range, then dumped or fell in the water.
a woman heard the shots from her boat, putting the time of death at 5: 38 p. m.last night.
did she see anything?
no. No witnesses.
bruising looks to be a few days old.
coroner thought the same.
so far he and forensics haven't found much else that helps us.
Jane, anything to add before we go?
Yeah, the sun and the sea-- isn't it wonderful?
anything to add about the victim?
rich guy, c.e. o.probably killed over money.
way of the world.
that's all you got?
do you know in seven years, each and every cell is completely replaced in your body?
that means you are literally a different person from when we first met.
sadder but wiser.
he's very wet.
that must mean something.
grieving widow? - Yeah.
hello.
you were watching me.
Yes. - Why?
it's my job.
your husband was murdered at the marina. - Yes - Sorry for your loss. - Thank you.
you seem genuinely upset.
does that surprise you?
how long were you and your husband married?
I'm sorry. I don't know your name.
about a year.
what do you see?
you're independent, ambitious, competitive, yet you have a warmth about you.
enough to charm the stoic agent cho, which is no small feat, let me tell you.
you're skilled at getting people to open up to you, to trust you.
and there's a question of whether you use that skill to help people or to manipulate them.
a little of both, if I'm being honest.
I'm a matchmaker.
I help people find true love.
you think it's silly. - No.
good enough job, I imagine.
you think the idea of true love is silly. - No.
that explains it.
explains what?
the utter sadness I see in you.
we're all finished, mrs. Flynn. I could walk you out, if you like.
thank you, agent Cho. You've been very good to me.
I'll walk her out, if you don't mind.
not at all. - Sure.
it was very nice to meet you,Patrick.
hopefully next time, it'll be under better circumstances.
you know, every day women come to me, hoping I'll help them find a kind, gentle man to fall in love with.
I'm sure any one of them would be lucky to meet you.
what was that all about?
Oh, she's just thanking me for consoling her.
Oh, and here I thought you hated talking to widows.
this one's a little different.
how so?
she murdered her husband.
you're right. Usually, it's the victim's spouse who's the murderer, but Erica Flynn has an alibi.
I'd expect nothing less from her.
one of her clients is in with Rigsby right now, and she swears that she was with Erica at the time of death.
then I must be wrong.
she did say that her husband got in a fight a few days ago, he came home with a bruise.
she doesn't know who the fight was with.
any guesses?
the reality is John Flynn ran a multi-million dollar company.
he had money, dozens of employees, and a lot of ruthless competitors.
and Flynn's file also says that he gave half a million dollars to charity last year.
that's the first time he's ever done that. - So?
it's a red flag.
how is giving to charity a red flag?
giving to charity isn't a red flag.
giving half a million dollars to charity, out of the blue, is.
it's a sure sign of a guilty conscience.
that is so far from the truth.
well, think about the people that donate that kind of money to charity.
all right, wall street executives, crooked politicians, troubled celebrities.
it is all in the name of clearing their conscience.
you're horrible.
how long have you been a member of Symphony?
Oh, just a few days, actually.
night before last was my first interview with Erica.
and what time was this?
from 5: 00 until just after 6: 00.
and you're convinced that Erica Flynn was there the entire time?
Yes. - Can anyone confirm that?
Oh, I think the rest of the staff had already left the office by the time we started.
I'm a litigator, so that was the earliest I could meet Erica.
Oh, it's probably why I joined the service in the first place.
it's not that I'm some social leper or anything.
I mean, I can meet people. I meet people all the time.
So...No? - No.
but there's the DVD.
the DVD? - Of the interview.
Yeah, it's part of, uh, Symphony's service.
a client interview, appearance counseling, date coaching.
it's actually a very thorough approach to matchmaking.
anyway, Erica was interviewing me the whole time.
just see for yourself.
Just--just--god, don't show it to too many people 'cause it's kind of embarrassing.
and they haven't edited out all my silly faces, dumb comments yet.
Oh, my god. - Okay, it's fine. You can watch it.
I mean, for investigative purposes, obviously, not that if you wanted to watch it for other reasons you couldn't.
got it.
uh, well, we'll call with any other questions.
thanks for your time.
okay, right. Well, no, thank you.
all right, I- I had- I have a question.
I... will just...
are you in a relationship?
no. Um, I'm not, actually.
well... Good to know.
uh, nice to meet you, agent Rigsby.
nice to meet you, Sarah.
uh, this way.
right. - Yeah.
Hey, boss. You gotta see this.
it's a video of john Flynn's ex-wife, Kim Cartwright.
I found it online while doing background.
3 months ago, my husband of 21 years, John Flynn, told me he was divorcing me.
John said he wanted to be alone, that he didn't want to be married anymore.
well, John, this is what I think of your settlement agreement.
word is out on you, John.
I am going to tell everyone exactly what kind of a man you are because you are a pig!
you are a coward!
I made that video almost a year ago.
I was upset.
you were more than upset, Ms. Cartwright.
you threatened to make your ex-husband's life miserable.
talk to me when your ex-husband remarries someone ten years yoger and two sizes smaller.
Libby, no. No barking.
where were you that night?
I was home alone.
I didn't kill John, if that's what you're thinking.
Oh, my god. That's what you're thinking.
that's insane!
John and I reconciled months ago.
we--we spoke all the time.
including the afternoon he was murdered.
do you recall what you two talked about?
John was unhappy in his marriage, and he needed someone to listen.
so he called his ex-wife?
okay, it's complicated, all right?
bad dog.
no bark.
you said was unhappy in his marriage. Why?
well, John loved his company, but he was ready to step back and enjoy life, and Erica didn't feel that way. She kept pushing him to expand Symphony.
it caused problems between them.
when we found John, he had a bruise over his left eye.
he mentioned that he'd gotten into a fight with an ex-client, Henry Cliff.
you know what the fight was about?
no, he was evasive.
it was something he didn't want to share.
did you know Erica Flynn signed a prenup before she got married?
you're barking up the wrong tree.
time coding puts the start of the meeting at 5: 00 p. m.
it finishes just after 6: 00, just like Sarah said, which means that Erica Flynn was at her office at the time of the murder.
try to look directly into camera.
it will allow your future soul mate to better connect with you.
what do you think of these dating services anyway?
no and yes.
what?
no, I've never used one, and yes, you should.
Oh, because you're cool, and I'm not?
anything to stop you dating your co-workers.
how would your closest friends describe you to someone who doesn't know you?
well, I think they would say...
uh, we have you scheduled to come in next tuesday.
okay, great.
see you then.
welcome to Symphony.
if you'll just fill out this profile, someone will be with you shortly.
profile.
I see you two have met.
Peter's our reception clerk, though I doubt for much longer.
he's a very talented musician, writes such beautiful music.
Patrick is a consultant with CBI.
he's investigating John's murder.
I'll hold your calls.
we're all a little overwhelmed today, as you can imagine.
I shouldn't even be here.
but to be honest, I didn't have much of a choice.
with John gone, well, you understand.
is there any news in the investigation? - No.
do you have any more questions for me? - Not really.
I think I understand.
understand what?
why you're here.
I wasn't sure at first when I saw your ring, but you're single, aren't you?
that's not why I'm here.
there's nothing to be ashamed of, Patrick.
I've helped a great many clients in the exact same situation as you.
well, I'm not in a situation. There's no situation.
I know what you're feeling. I've been there.
Yeah, I don't think you have.
you were in a relationship once, you were in love, but it ended badly, and you were deeply hurt as a result.
your shut yourself off from the world and avoid meeting new people because you don't want to ever feel that loss again.
but now you're ready to move on with your life.
I can see it in you.
you can find happiness again, even true love, but you have to be willing to let me help you.
that was spooky.
it was like you read my mind.
our in-house studio is right this way.
it's where we conduct our client interviews.
how many interviews have you conducted here?
enough to know what I'm doing.
that's bright.
very fancy.
we like to show our clients in the best possible light.
I thought true love was blind.
we may love with our hearts, but first we lust with our eyes.
don't you agree?
if you make yourself comfortable, we can get started.
here? - Yeah.
okay.
try to look directly into the camera.
it will allow your future soul mate to better connect with you.
how's that? - Perfect.
I'm gonna ask you a series of standardized questions.
these have been designed to get at the heart of who you are and who you're compatible with.
try to answer as honestly as possible. Ready?
Yes. - Good.
now, Patrick, what kind of woman are you interested in?
rich, quiet blondes.
no snoring. That's a deal-breaker.
we were told you punched out John Flynn.
Yeah, I hit John.
it was a misunderstanding.
who misunderstood what?
it was nothing, a tiff.
two days before he was murdered.
am I under arrest?
no, you're just a person of interest at this point, a suspect.
unless you can clear things up with a simple explanation.
all right.
it was about a woman, okay?
met her at a singles mixer John's company organized.
we hit it off at the bar, a few drinks, few laughs.
next thing I know, she invites me up to her room. All right?
I'm up there, what, two seconds, boom--she is all over me.
I mean, really hot and really passionate.
get to the part where you punch out John Flynn.
Yeah, right.
uh, two days later, I get a phone call.
I think she wants another bite off the old cliff bar, right?
no.
turns out the bitch is blackmailing me.
says she videotaped our whole night together.
says unless I give her $15, 000, she's going public with that video.
you paid the money?
well, yeah. I can't have a sex tape going around.
look, I'm a Sac metro top ten prestige realtor.
my face is on the friggin' billboard.
I get respect in this community.
so you went after Flynn.
he's supposed to be screening these women, for Pete's sake.
but look, it's not what you think.
John and I talked it out.
he swore to me that he would handle it personally, said he was gonna make sure she got caught and put in jail for what she did.
so much for that plan, right?
I have just one more question.
in an ideal world, what would you want your life to be like?
haven't thought about that.
in an ideal world?
a pet dragon, definitely, for flying around on. That would be good.
please try and answer seriously. It's important.
what do you want from your life?
I want my life to be free.
free how? To love? To be loved?
free from my past.
I wanna tell you something.
every day I introduce men and women to one another.
if I do my job well, those people connect.
they spark.
I can actually see it.
just like I see it in you right now with me.
I don't say this to make you uncomfortable.
I say it because I want you to know, no matter how alone you feel, you are capable of finding love, of moving on.
I was wondering when you'd do this.
do what?
try to manipulate me.
I would never do that.
I'm simply pointing out emotions I know you feel towards me.
you're wrong.
I don't feel anything like that towards you for one very good reason
you murdered your husband.
that's not funny.
it wasn't meant to be.
why would I kill my husband?
money, well, money and control of the company. Same difference, really.
John was gonna leave you, and if he left, the company left with him.
everything that you worked for, everything that you'd built-- gone.
and you couldn't let that happen.
no.
you're all about autonomy, control.
abused as a child, I expect.
I didn't kill my husband.
in fact, you don't actually believe I did.
no? - No.
you're simply doing what you've been doing ever since your wife died
intentionally sabotaging any relationship by pushing away anyone who makes you feel something.
you want me to be the killer because you don't want to have feelings for me.
it's a tragic but natural response to the guilt you feel over your wife's death.
I do push people away, and I do feel guilt over my wife's death, but that does not change the fact that you murdered your husband.
I am more certain of it now than ever.
if that's the case, prove it.
where are we with the Flynn murder?
Rigsby and I are still checking out henry Cliff's alibi.
he said he was in a bar watching the game, but we still haven't found anyone to confirm it.
stay on it.
what about the ex-wife?
still no alibi either, but I did find a lawsuit kim cartwright filed against Flynn around the same time she posted that online video.
looks like it has something to do with the divorce settlement.
I'm having the courthouse messenger over the files.
and the blackmailer, Naomi?
Yeah, we're having some trouble tracking her down.
symphony doesn't have that information?
it's all fake--photos, driver's license, social security number.
I mean, the forgery's good, so I can see how they missed 'em.
all we have is Cliff's description of her, including a small tattoo near her hip.
so basically, we have nothing to go on.
okay, let's start with what we do know about Naomi.
uh, she targeted a rich, single man, with the purpose of extorting him, right?
right.
so if she's done it once, she's probably done it before.
van pelt, check into every dating service in the bay area.
see if they've had any experience with Naomi.
maybe we can get to her that way. - On it.
there are 11 matchmaking services in the bay area, four of which specifically cater to high-end clients.
did they know Naomi? - No. And none have reported any extortion claims, but I got to thinking, what if she's planning to blackmail again?
I checked with the companies in the area, and one is planning a singles mixer tonight.
on a hunch, I cross-checked Naomi's profile from symphony with all the profiles of the women listed as attending the event.
I got a match-- a woman named Viktoria Shays.
no photo, but several answers she gave about herself are identical to Naomi's.
is Rigsby here?
Yeah, somewhere.
tell him to go home and put on a nice suit. He's got plans tonight.
all right.- Have you seen my laptop?
no.
now, Sarah, what kind of men are you interested in?
wow, right to it.
now, Patrick, what kind of woman are you looking for?
quiet, rich blondes. No snoring. That is a deal-breaker.
how would your closest friends describe you to someone who doesn't know you?
uh, well, I think they
now, Patrick, what kind of woman are you looking for?
quiet, rich blondes. No snoring. That is a deal-breaker.
now, Sarah, what kind of men are you interested in?
wow, right to it.
so what do you think?
I think you look good.
thank you. - Cho?
I'm not answering that question.
Oh, come on. Honestly, just tell me what you think.
you look all right.
Thanks.
I think you look great, like you have money, a career
a perfect target for Naomi. - I don't know.
what if she doesn't go for it? - She will.
what if she doesn't go for me?
I mean, there's gonna be a lot of single guys there. For this to work, she has to be interested in me.
she will. Just be yourself.
that's a terrible idea.
maybe I should do an accent or something.
I don't think you need an accent.
hello. Rigsby.
Wayne Rigsby from Sussex.
uh, pleasure to meet you.
cheerio.
how's that? - Yeah, don't do the accent.
Rigsby, can you hear me?
loud and clear.
van Pelt, you in position?
I'm here.
gentlemen.
can I have your attention?
it's time for me to bring in the beautiful women you'll be meeting tonight.
don't forget the a-b-c's-- attentiveness, boldness, confidence.
you'll do great.
Rigsby, the event hostess has I. d.'d Naomi.
excuse me one moment.
okay, which one is she?
the blonde in the lavender sheath.
the one in the what now?
the blonde in the purple dress.
got it.
are you sure it's her? - No.
find out if she's got a rose tattoo on her hip.
then we'll know for sure.
I'm moving in.
Hello, Red.
can I buy you a drink? - I'm engaged.
well, it's never too late for one last-- keep walking
okay.
I'm Wayne. - I'm Viktoria.
nice to meet you.
so what do you do, Wayne? - I'm a businessman.
e-commerce, mainly.
how's that going for you?
it's working out pretty well.
I have a very diverse portfolio.
and I have a room upstairs.
and you're very direct.
is that a problem?
I'm trying to think of a reason why it might be, and I can't really think of one right now.
are you nervous?
me? No.
Yeah, maybe a little.
well, don't be. I won't bite.
good. Me either. No biting.
3-1-6--my favorite number. 3-1-6.
uh, just curious, uh, do you have any tattoos?
um, why don't you come and find out?
Okay.
so come in. Make yourself comfortable. I'll be right out
Thanks.
guys?
you hear me?
she's in the bathroom.
that is a, um, very nice tattoo.
of a rose.
it's a rose tattoo.
uh, maybe we should have a drink first or, uh, you know, uh...
a snack.
so would you call yourself adventurous, Wayne?
adventurous? Um, what, like skydiving?
mm, no.
uh, sorry to interrupt.
CBI.
uh, yeah, found the, uh, tattoo.
this is definitely the suspect.
nice work. - Yeah. Your collar.
your arrest, Wayne.
Oh, yeah.
you're under arrest.
I'm surprised to see you're back.
are you here to finish your profile?
no.
I saw something strange on the DVD you're using as your alibi, so I came by to test out a theory.
so you're still trying to prove I murdered my husband?
you're still worried I will?
come on in.
why don't you have a seat?
you want to interview me? Why?
like I said, I have a theory.
you scared? - No.
it might be good for me to experience what my clients go through.
you can ask questions from in there, yes?
Yes. - Thank you.
what have you got up your sleeve?
patience.
okay - Can you hear me? - Yes.
okay, Erica, tell me, what kind of man are you looking for?
I'm not looking. I'm mourning.
Yes.
uh, please humor me.
someone kind and generous, someone patient.
I'm sorry. I'm really not comfortable talking about this.
how would your closest friends describe you to someone who doesn't know you?
Patrick, what are you doing?
how would you describe yourself to someone who doesn't know you?
what's going on in here?
I'm proving my theory.
I heard a strange sound on the DVD you're using as your alibi-- a faint clicking noise.
almost mechanical.
then I figured out what it was.
how would you describe yourself to some
a simple tape recorder, just like this one.
I knew you weren't here for the interview.
how could you be? You're off killing your husband.
but how do we explain your voice on the DVD?
this is ridiculous.
recording the interview is easy.
after all, you've done hundreds of them.
and once you had the recorder in place, you had plenty of time to leave through that door, kill your husband, and come back here without anyone noticing you're gone.
but there is one thing you needed in order for your plan to work
an accomplice.
you needed someone to be here and to play the recorded questions at the right time.
that's the one loose end you left untied.
that explains it, doesn't it?
of course there's just one problem.
so if what you're saying is true, I walked out right past my client in the middle of her interview.
Yeah.
something she would have mentioned, huh?
I didn't kill my husband, Patrick.
I do understand.
after all you've been through, you see evil everywhere.
I see you. - Patrick.
you are a kind, clever, wonderful man.
you have so much potential.
but you have to stop this obsessive behavior.
you need to get a life.
good night, Erica.
good night, Patrick.
all you've proven is that Erica Flynn may have murdered her husband, not that she did.
which is why i need to find her accomplice.
if there is an accomplice.
there's no "if" - Yes, there is.
we've got other viable suspects on this thing.
like who?
like Naomi, for one.
she's a greedy opportunist that hates men. She's not a cold-blooded killer.
we don't know that for sure.
you always say that the simplest answers usually are the most likely, but it seems like you're coming up with more and more elaborate scenarios just to prove that you're right.
Erica killed her husband.
I am 100% sure of it.
I don't get it.
what is it about this woman?
why are you so obsessed with her?
because she doesn't think I'm smart enough to catch her.
Oh, well, that's a good reason.
healthy. Professional.
uh, just answer me one more thing.
okay, if Erica Flynn did murder her husband, how did she leave the room without her client noticing?
that I don't know.
but I'm working on it.
you're going to jail,Naomi.
nothing can prevent that from happening, but you can help yourself out here.
tell me what you know about John Flynn.
nothing. I've never even met him.
now we both know that's not true.
John Flynn ran Symphony.
he found out you were blackmailing his clients and confronted you, didn't he?
I never blackmailed anyone.
but we have multiple victims who claim otherwise.
we have the video camera you hid in your hotel room with other victims on it.
you watched that tape?
did any of those guys look like victims to you?
they look like johns being conned by a clever prostitute.
I'm not a prostitute.
where were you between the hours of 5: 00 and 6: 00 the night of the murder?
I want my lawyer.
I've got nothing more to say to you. - Okay.
but we're waiting on a warrant to search your apartment.
you talk now, we can make a deal.
we find anything linking you to the murder, all bets are off.
lawyer.
uh, yes, Erica interviewed me from the a. v. room, but she never left.
are you sure? - Yes. She would've had to walk right past me.
what are you doing?
during your interview, do you remember how bright the lights were in that room?
Yes.
shining right in your face, in fact.
well, I guess so.
Yes, I once had a job onstage. I'll never forget how bright those lights can be.
what does that have to do with anything?
I'll show you. Keep your eye on your phone.
what are you doing?
it's gone. - Precisely.
Hey, is that sarah still here? - Why?
just had a few, uh, follow-up questions about the investigation.
you're such a bad liar.
she left five minutes ago.
Really?
just call her up and ask her out. - What's the big deal?
I can't do that. It's totally unprofessional.
unless she says yes.
I think she'd say yes.
I mean, she asked me if I was single.
why would she ask if I was single unless she wanted me to ask her out, right?
Sarah, hi. It's, uh, Wayne Rigsby from CBI.
if you keep up with these visits, I'm gonna have to start charging you.
Oh, this will be the last one, I assure you.
have you given up on this nonsense about me killing my husband?
Nope, not at all. Not one little tiny bit.
well, then you must have cracked the case.
please tell me.
I'm curious to know who this evil accomplice of mine is.
well, I came by it rather easily, I must say, after a-a friend got me thinking on the right path.
which path is that?
the simplest answer is most likely the correct one, which means your accomplice is someone you can easily manipulate.
a man, which is obvious enough, given your physical attributes.
I'm really getting tired-- I'm not finished.
he's also young and impressionable, weak, but above all, someone you can make fall in love with you, and someone naive enough to believe that you had fallen in love with them.
guess who I'm thinking of.
Yes, that's right. Your assistant Peter.
you have no idea what you're talking about.
Ah, we'll find out soon enough.
what's going on?
Mrs. Flynn, we'd like you to come back to the office with us, answer a few questions.
of course. Anything to help.
how long do you think it'll take before he tells me everything? Hmm?
how you holding up, peter?
I'm tired.
Ah, not to worry. You won't be here much longer.
I know you're not gonna talk, and I know why.
you're in love with Erica.
no, that's okay. You don't need to deny it. I get it.
she's beautiful, she's smart, she's successful.
makes you wonder, though, right?
wonder what?
what she sees in you, apart from her alibi.
I mean, let's be honest here, Peter.
you don't really have that much to offer her.
that's not true. - Oh, so you are having an affair.
I-I-I did not say that.
right. We're being honest here, Peter.
deep down, do you really think that she loves you?
or are you just kidding yourself because it feel so nice to be with her?
no. I love her, and she loves me.
she was using you.
she made you an accessory to murder.
you're wrong.
she got what she wanted from you and now she is done with you. - Stop. Stop saying that.
she doesn't love you, Peter. She never did.
now tell me what happened the night Erica murdered her husband.
she problem told you that he was abusing her, right?
smacking her around, raping her?
I don't care what you say.
I'm not gonna hurt Erica.
what do we do now?
let him go.
Hi, Wayne.
you look amazing. - Oh, thanks.
so do you. Oh, are you ready to go?
Yeah.
I was hoping you'd call me.
Yeah, I'm glad I did.
me, too.
hard at work, I see.
what do you want?
I'd like to thank you for having me brought down here.
that was very courteous of you.
though I have to admit, I was a little surprised your colleagues decided to simply let me go, you being so certain of my guilt and all.
let me guess-- Peter didn't say a word to you?
maybe now you'll be able to move past this nonsense.
let me tell you something.
I will catch you, sooner or later, and I promise you that I will catch you. 
please.
if you were capable of catching me, you would have done so by now.
good-bye, Patrick.
Jane. Jane, we gotta go.
I just got a call from s. f.p. d. Peter's dead.
he killed himself.
sleeping pills.
coroner found an empty bottle in the bathroom.
so...
sole accomplice in your crime just went and killed himself.
fortunately, however, Peter left a letter.
and I'm betting it will tell us everything we need to know about the night your husband was murdered.
you confess now, chances are the a. g.'s office is gonna cut you a deal.
open it.
be my guest.
Yes, it's a bluff.
honestly, I expected better from you.
using poor Peter's suicide as a trap?
that's low, immoral, even.
I tried to tell you. I always win.
you might have gotten away with murder, but you didn't win.
how's that exactly?
no matter what you say, I know the truth.
you cared about Peter, and it was your actions that drove him to kill himself.
that is something that you will live with for the rest of your life.
I'll manage.
no, you won't. It'll eat you up from the inside, because you cared way too much about him.
you're wrong.
no, I'm right, just like i'm right about the first time I saw you.
you are an open book to me.
you're transparent, like glass.
if you think for a moment I even remotely cared about Peter, you're as gullible as he was.
not just cared. You loved him. I know it. Can't you see?
there's nothing you can hide from me.
you're a fool. - And you're a terrible liar.
you lost, Erica, not just some little game.
you lost someone you loved.
I didn't love Peter. I could care less about him.
he meant nothing to me.
perfect.
that's exactly what I was hoping to hear, rather, that's exactly what I was hoping Peter would hear.
thank god you're here.
don't listen to a word they say. They're telling you lies.
you know how I feel about you, darling.
Peter. Peter! Please!
by the way, there was a body in that bag.
it wasn't Peter's. No, of course not.
that's kind of obvious. It was your husband's.
and I told you I would catch you, and I did.
Erica left ten minutes into the interview.
she told me to wait behind with the recorder.
she said if I just played the questions, then no one would ever know she was gone.
she knew John was going down to the marina after work.
that time of day, there aren't a lot of people around, you know?
she waited for him and...
and you shot him.
you shot your own husband in cold blood.
Peter told us everything.
you used him as your accomplice because he was weak, unstable.
you could manipulate him. But it backfired.
he couldn't take the pressure, and now he'll testify against you, and you will spend a very long time in prison.
don't count on it.
it's over.
a jury still has to believe him.
and he is, as you so accurately put it, unstable.
Erica, it's over.
I'm sure of it.
don't be.
not everyone's as smart as you.
you in here?
Ah, there's my computer.
uh, I'm looking for someone who, uh...
someone...
I can trust, someone strong, someone...
at peace with themselves, someone better than me, someone who knows the...
worst side of me and still loves me.
sounds like an amazing woman.
she was.
morning, boss.
victim's name was Walton Parsell.
owner of the jewelry store found him here this morning.
says Walton bought a woman's necklace from her around closing time last night.
so not a robbery.
no. Local cops say there was a jewelry store burglary across town last month.
no signs of a break-in.
check the surveillance footage.
what do we know about the victim?
he's a prison guard from carson, just outside of town.
you sure? - Yeah. What?
Oh, okay. It's in his hands.
Yeah, bit nails, not too calloused.
blue collar job, high stress, but no heavy lifting. Prison guard.
thought I was losing my touch there for a second.
God forbid.
clothes tell a different story.
check out those formal but, uh, comfortable boots and the cheap business suit.
looks, uh, looks a little like a detective.
don't you think? - He kinda does, doesn't he?
Yeah. Hey, this is not a cheap suit.
Oh, hey, hey, I'm not saying anything about your suit.
I'm sure it's not. You're the real deal.
but this man here-- he was--he was aspirational.
he had hopes to be a lot more than a prison guard.
too bad the job killed him.
the job? How so?
well, he worked at a prison. That's where they keep killers.
an ex-inmate-- probably our best bet.
there are a lot of stab wounds.
that's how they learn to kill in prison.
prison shanks have points, not blades.
they use 'em to puncture bowels, cause sepsis.
charming.
well, the question is this-- why would you use a prison shank outside of prison?
I'll run a check of all the ex-inmates from carson in the area.
it's a wedding invitation.
is there a dinner?
salmon or prime rib. - I'm in.
who am I sitting with?
you're next to Cho.
where are we with walton parsell?
grew up outside of hangtree. Parents are dead. No close relations nearby.
started up at carson on his 21st birthday.
I used his call history to track down a girlfriend-- Shelley Dillion.
she's a hairdresser in town.
I'll take Jane and go talk to her. Cho, you go to the prison.
where are we with jane's hunch that there's an ex-con involved?
the prison sent over the list you asked for.
ex-carson inmates with violent records still living in the county.
if Jane's right, one of these guys is responsible.
it's probably shoe-leather, but somebody should check it out.
take a look at that?
I'm on it. - All right.
want a partner?
guess not.
I need to talk to you about a murder investigation I'm working on.
keep walking, pig.
I got nothin' for you.
Hello, dad. Good to see you, too.
you're still here, huh?
you want a beer?
No.'Course not.
surprised you even know where to find me.
Oh, I make it my business to know exactly where you are at all times.
Really?
keepin' tabs on me, huh?
ain't that sweet?
so you still in Sacramento?
I just need to ask you a few questions.
procedure.
I'm talking to everyone on this list of ex-carson inmates.
cops.
that guard's been dead less than a day, and you're already grasping at straws.
so you know about the case.
know about it?
Hello, boy, walking around town ten minutes, I could tell you who the killer is.
but not cops.
they got procedures.
look, I... I have to know if you were-- I get it.
no, sir, officer, I did not kill anyone last night.
then tell me where you were.
cat and the fiddle on delaware.
they all remember me.
you working?
I get by.
smuggling cigarettes?
dealing meth again?
my own flesh and blood-- a lousy cop.
makes me wanna puke. - I just don't wanna see you back in jail. That's all.
you always were a self-righteous little bastard.
that comes from your mom's side of the family.
no matter how many times I straightened you out, I never could fix you of that.
it's in the blood, I guess.
if you have nothing more to say about walton parsell, thanks for your time.
I guess I'm in shock.
I feel like I'm numb, you know?
how long had you known Walton?
two months.
that's pretty long for me.
and when was the last time you saw him?
two nights ago.
we had dinner out-- quick chinese, nothing special.
he was supposed to call me last night.
but he didn't.
I thought he was done with me.
you know, like that was it.
Walton had bought a gold necklace just before he died, and you were worried that he was gonna leave you?
because he was a good person?
he wasn't your usual type, was he? - Yeah, tell me about it.
I don't know if i'll meet another guy like walton.
Yes, your taste for bad boys is a sad relic of your childhood mistreatment.
no need to pick it back up again.
Oh, gee, thanks for the advice, dr. Phil.
just because you've heard it before doesn't mean it's not good advice.
tell us about Walton.
Walton had a plan.
he wasn't floating.
he was taking night classes at the community college-- criminology.
wanted to be a detective.
can you think of anybody who may have wanted to hurt Walton?
no. No, nobody.
okay. Well, if you think of anything else, just give us a call.
I will.
Oh, uh, shelley, there is one more thing.
have you ever stolen supplies from work here?
no. No. Of course not.
good girl.
Walton meant well. That's for sure.
But?
well, he had these dreams of being a detective.
he just didn't get that's not what we do here.
we're not detectives. We're zookeepers.
he was overzealous.
look, I don't want my men looking for trouble.
I want them to finish their shifts with nobody getting hurt, including themselves.
did you know Walton was studying criminology at the local college?
Yeah. That was a big part of the problem.
that school was just spurring him on.
just last month, he told me he was already building a case to transfer one of the inmates to one of those supermax facilities, getting help from one of his professors.
which inmate?
well, Walton wouldn't tell us. It's confidential, he says.
he wanted to present his case to us and, uh, warden at the next staff meeting.
did the inmates know what Walton was doing?
the inmates know everything-- more than me.
that's something else Walton didn't understand.
and studies constantly show that eyewitness identification is wrong as often as it is right, because the human brain is not a computer.
can anyone tell me what day of the week may 31st, 1976 fell on?
tell me quickly. You see-- monday.
pardon me?
Monday. It was a monday. My brain is a computer.
it's a steel trap.
a computerized steel trap... - Professor Huff, hi.
I'm agent Lisbon. This is Patrick Jane. We're with the CBI.
we're investigating the murder of Walton parsell.
Oh, I was very sorry to hear about it. How can we help you?
uh, we know that he was looking to transfer an inmate at the prison, and, uh
Yes. The inmate was involved in extortion and racketeering, and we analyzed the legal framework required to take action.
did he give you the inmate's name?
well, we deliberately don't use real names in our conversations.
I'm sure he probably mentioned it, but I don't recall.
I'll take over from here, if you don't mind.
Hello, class.
memory is unreliable because the untrained brain has a crappy filing system.
it takes everything that happens to you and throws it all willy-nilly into a big, dark closet.
when you go in there looking for something, all you can find are the big, obvious things like when your mind died, or stuff that you don't really need, stuff that you're not looking for like, uh, like the words to "copacabana."
you can't find what you need, but don't panic, because it is still there.
now if we may, my lovely assistant and I will help you rummage through your magic closets.
somewhere in there lurks a name, so start digging and sorting and pulling things out, and weeding through.
it may be connected to, uh, the way that walton laughed or the smell of his breath.
you just thought of something.
the inmate must have tattoos.
Walton said the guy beat up a tattooist for spelling "aryan" wrong.
there we go. Excellent.
Walton asked me questions about crime in my hometown, Fontana.
very good. We're getting somewhere here.
just let your mind go wherever it wants.
he may have lent you a pen. He may have worn an ugly shirt.
mnh-mnh, no, no, he was very buttoned up and very neat like a soldier.
um... Like a-a roman soldier.
a general. Caesar.
Julius... Brutus... Marcus.
the inmate's name was Marcus.
so we're looking for an inmate with white gang tattoos who's from Fontana whose name is Marcusarcus.
that'll help. - Excellent work.
class dismissed. No homework.
her name was Lola.
she was a showgirl.
Marcus Lansdale-- he was a member of the white trash lowriders from fontana when he shot a highway patrolman during a routine traffic stop ten years ago.
patrolman's in a wheelchair.
looks like Walton picked a winner.
they suspect him of running the prison's protection racket,
protects the drug dealers from the gangs, takes care of snitches, but they can't prove any of it.
if Walton was asking questions, Lansdale probably heard about it.
Jane and I will go talk to him.
if he's involved, that means there's a hit man on the outside.
Rigsby. Jane's hunch about the ex-carson inmate pay off?
I checked out everyone on the list. Nothing hinky.
all right, we need to check into lansdale's known associates.
uh, boss, can I, uh, talk to you for a minute? - Sure.
in your office. - All right.
I've never talked to you about my father. - Sit down.
I know about your dad. I'm your boss.
steven Robert Rigsby, convicted of manslaughter, assault.
your father was on that list, wasn't he?
I checked out his alibi.
no special treatment. If you wanna send someone else-- I trust you, Rigsby.
however, if you ever come into contact with your father on a case, next time, you bring somebody with you.
Yeah, okay.
you need to get a list of lansdale's known associates.
get it done by morning.
you got it, boss.
we're here to talk to you about Walton Parsell.
we've read your files-- I haven't.
I'm--I'm getting to it.
I've read your file.
I know that you're running the protection racket here at Carson and that Walton was planning on moving you to a higher security prison.
california law used to say that a man sentenced to life in prison is legally dead.
that's a fact.
legally dead.
and... - I've been a dead man for ten years.
the outside world's got no hold on me.
you think some screw poking into my business bothers me?
Aw, you're not so tough.
there's always bigger fish.
not in my pond.
well, Walton wanted you transferred.
you might have ended up in a pond with a giant pike or snapping turtles.
I have defended myself very successfully against charges that I am a security risk.
so whatever Parsell wanted to throw at me would've gone the same way.
did you know what Walton was gonna do?
not until you told me.
maybe one of your friends on the outside told you.
Oh, I can take care of myself.
that's how you ought to know I didn't kill him.
how so?
because if I want a guard dead, you will find him in a broom closet right here in carson in my cellblock.
uh, I think he's made some good points. Marcus, it's been fun.
I got places to go and people to meet.
personally I think you got the cheekbones that you can support something really short.
I mean, it'd look great on you.
you got a great skull. I've always said that. - I really wish you'd stop.
Oh, we brought a photo as a reference.
what? - There.
why didn't you tell us you had a brother in prison?
I don't tell anyone about Marcus.
how'd you know?
well, you share some of the same recessive genes, same earlobes, and you both have the same tell before you lie.
you were dating a guy who's trying to transfer your brother.
he ends up dead. It doesn't look good.
wait, wait, wait. You think I killed him?
that's--that's crazy.
not really. - Convince us. Where were you last night?
Annie from the salon's bachelorette party.
anyway, it doesn't matter.
I never would have hurt him.
but you lied to him.
Marcus knew walton was trying to get him transferred, so he asked me to get to know him and see what his weaknesses are.
one day I followed walton from carson.
he went to a coffee shop. I went in after. We got to talking.
we had our first date a few days later.
you thought Walton was a sucker.
he could help your brother out, maybe get a few free meals.
what you first thought was weakness you realized was kindness, and then you got to like the guy.
did Walton find out about you?
no, he never found out, and I wasn't gonna tell him.
when Marcus called me last week, I told...
you told him you couldn't do it anymore, and he got mad.
did he threaten you?
you don't know what he can do.
I think we do.
walton's dead. Your brother couldn't have done it from prison.
that means Walton's killer is on the loose.
well... - Well, what?
well, I'm not so sure. I mean, this...
make a statement.
maybe we can get your brother to talk, find out who killed Walton.
no. I'm sorry.
that's...that's my brother.
I talked to Shelley's co-workers. Her alibi checks out.
figures. She didn't feel right for it anyway.
still, she could be an accomplice.
Where's Jane?
uh, first thing in the morning, he had Cho take him back to Carson.
Oh, what for? Lansdale isn't talking, and the killer's on the outside.
whatever.
any breaks on finding lansdale's hit man?
I talked to hangtree p. d. They don't have any ideas about a murder-for-hire candidate.
Lansdale's known associates on the outside are a pretty small list.
his whole gang's still in jail.
I read the file from the jewelry store burglary last month, and there's nothing there.
we need a new angle.
what is it?
there is...One angle I could try.
well, I thought you'd be back.
but I didn't think you'd bring a gift.
we just need a moment of your time.
can I get you somethin' to drink?
no. - I wasn't talking to you.
no, thank you.
you get on that yet?
I warned her you'd be crude.
couldn't close the deal, huh?
look, we need your help finding the killer of walton parsell.
Yeah, you said you could find the killer in ten minutes.
if I wanted to do that, but why would I wanna do that?
to show me you can.
show me you're not just full of big talk.
well, the least you could do is ask nice. I know you know how to ask nice.
please, dad.
I need your help.
all right.
we need to find a woman by the name of Rocket.
old flame of mine.
she knows everything that goes on in hangtree.
rocket? Real name?
got an address?
well, I don't know where she sleeps, but I know where she lives-- this jailbird bar in town.
can you take us to her?
Yeah, I can do that.
just give me a second. I'll get my keys.
he was trying to, uh, transfer Lansdale?
see, that's Walton for you.
meant well, but naive.
Lansdale sounds like a good target for transfer.
Lansdale is the muscle at Carson.
nobody's gonna talk to Walton.
they don't wanna find themselves on the bad end of Lansdale's knife.
he did his own dirty work?
he who holds the knife gets the respect from the guys.
you wanna stay on top, you gotta back it up.
this is great.
reality TV at its finest.
everything that happens in cellblock "c" is right here on these monitors.
Lansdale's too hard-core for a small place. You didn't think about transfer yourself?
we're guards, not supermen.
having a shark like Lansdale in the tank keeps all these guys in line.
he did your job for you. That's nice.
so you disapproved of Walton going after Lansdale.
I didn't have any knowledge of that--walton's agenda.
that would be supposition.
okay.
Oh, you see these two?
they're about to punch each other.
look at the way their shoulders are set. It's very primal.
so are we done here?
I got work to do.
Jane, you have anything else?
there they go. Look, look, look, look. Fight.
we got a fight in northwest hallway "b."
somebody break it up.
okay, I'm on my way.
lock the-- lock the hallway down.
Jane, unless you have something, we need to get out of here.
no, you go. I'll--I'll get a ride home somehow.
this is way too good.
all right. - Way too good.
you gonna be here all day?
Oh, there you are.
I don't wanna scare you, but, uh...
I did some time myself once.
Really?
Oh, yeah.
anyway, uh, when I was inside, there were prisoners with privileges.
what do you call those-- trustees?
Yeah. - You have some here?
Yeah, we have a few. - I'd like to talk to some.
okay. Let's go.
those guys in the blue-- that's trustees from cellblock "c."
that's-- that's walton's block.
that guy, the bald man with the tattoo-- he got long left on his sentence?
Yeah. Down to his last year.
I'll take him.
Jorge! Over here.
let's take two. Keep 'em honest.
uh... The guy on the other end. Other side of the table.
Nick Monaco. Another short-timer.
he's not a murderer, is he?
no, Nicky's a second-story man.
a thief. Got clean hands.
him, too.
Nicky! Over here.
this is the place all right.
you wait here. I'll go get her.
no, we'll get her.
you two go walking in there looking like the cop family robinson, the joint will clear out, and you'll never find rocket.
okay. You're not back in two minutes, we're coming in.
you got it, officer.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. Sup, peckerwoods?
you know that game that kids play-- "my dad can beat up your dad"?
no one ever played that with me.
he's a...
character. - Yep.
maybe this will bring you two closer together.
don't hold your breath.
- You get her. I'm going in.
stop!
so bad now...
lower your weapon now!
get on outta here, boy. - I'm a cop. Everybody stay calm.
he's got a knife.
Yeah, I can see that.
what the hell's going on in here?
seems Andy over here was a little mad over the last time we crossed paths.
wanted to fistfight, only I don't do fistfights.
a waste of time. Right, Andy?
let me go.
please? Just put the knife down!
let me handle this.
the hell with that.
dad, nobody needs to get cut, and nobody needs to get shot.
just put the knife down.
guess old Andy here ain't gonna be taking any more pokes at me.
that's for sure.
you, get outta here.
your turn.
put the gun away, and we'll call this a wash.
better.
let's go.
what are you trying to do, embarrass me?
never get between me and my business again.
I just saved your life in there.
what, that clown? He wasn't gonna pull the trigger.
Really? And how'd you know?
weakness, son.
weakness. Lives in the eyes.
meet Rocket.
she's faster than she looks.
what the hell, Rigs?
I told you to play nice.
you know something about a prison guard getting killed in town?
no. No, Sir, I do not.
if I'm lying, I'm dying.
tell them. Tell them.
came into the bar last night.
flashed a wad of cash that would choke a mule.
said he dropped some prison guard for the dough.
where can we find Corwin?
well, he owns some land out near the quarry off route 23.
all right. Thanks for your assistance.
you some kind of V. I. P. Or something?
something. You boys can relax. I'm an ex-con myself.
writing wolf tickets, talking out your neck.
I'm hip. - Whatever you say, pal.
okay. That's an interesting tattoo. Looks fresh.
you just get that? - Yeah. My cousin just landed in here for drugs.
nice. - He's a real artist.
well, maybe Nick could use his services.
not me. I'm not into all that ink.
old school. I get it.
I take care of myself. So what?
nothing wrong with that.
what's through there?
it's a loading bay for the laundry.
let's go take a look, shall we?
do the laundry for every hotel and restaurant in hangtree.
must keep the prisoners very busy.
three shifts a day.
Yeah, all us trustees work as supervisors here in the laundry.
must know the movers and shakers around here, huh?
guys like Lansdale.
I know to mind my own business.
you know, you seem like a smart guy.
don't be an idiot. - Excuse me?
if you know something, maybe about Lansdale and his reign of terror, then tell me.
I can get your sentence shortened.
listen here.
I got six months left in this joint, and then I'm free.
I'd like to spend those six months unstabbed.
I get it. I've been down.
snitches get stitches.
Oh, see, that's a popular misconception.
the stitches are for live people.
got it.
is that him?
mask doesn't help, but yeah, I think so.
looks like Butch Carwin's got himself a good old-fashioned meth lab.
and he's armed.
that's probable cause. We can take him in right now.
we should call for backup. - No need. This is gonna be easy.
you don't need to prove anything to anyone. - Huh?
your father is the last person in the world you should be trying to impress.
you're a good person in spite of him. You don't owe him anything.
you got me wrong. I don't give a damn about my dad.
I'm just saying we can take Carwin down now, no problem.
CBI! Down to the ground, Carwin!
get down!
on the ground!
who's there? Who's there? I can't see anything, man! I'll pass.
get down on the ground now! - Okay, okay. Son of a bitch.
facedown on the ground!
arms out to the side now.
pretty good trick.
Yep. Always worked on my dad.
we've got you for production of methamphetamine and illegal weapons.
who knows what else we're gonna find?
I'm just no damn good. That's the truth.
you recognize this man?
I might have done a piece of time with a fella like that once.
what about this man?
Oh, him I don't know.
looks like a cop.
he's the man you killed for Marcus Lansdale.
okay, hold up. I did what now?
murder for hire. It's a capital crime.
you finger Lansdale, you'll just go to jail for a long time.
okay, look, I don't know who's telling you what, but I've never seen that fella in my life.
why don't you tell me where you were two nights ago?
Oh, I was cooking up meth.
hang tight, Butch.
it's gonna be a long day.
Hello?
Lisbon, it's Jane. I'm in jail. Come join me.
you're still in Carson? Why?
uh... I'm catching the killer, of course.
look, we've got a pretty good suspect in holding here.
you would know that if you answered your phone.
these places aren't exactly built for their reception.
anyway, trust me, Lisbon.
get your car keys. Get in your car.
and... Lisbon? Yeah.
what's this about?
uh, the gentleman with the shaking leg right there.
Tomas. Come on.
Aw, man. Looks like heroin.
uh, and I think if you check the water fountain, you might find, uh...
huh?
bingo.
it's not mine, man. - I'm sure it's not.
let's go. Let's go.
don't be so sure. Let's go. Let's go.
you ad me drive all the way out here to watch you bust a drug dealer?
it wasn't a bust.
I just had to check to see if my informant's info was good.
informant?
Yeah, I got one of the prisoners talking. Gonna give us Lansdale.
which prisoner did you get talking?
Nick, the thief. Yeah.
I did the ol' razzle-dazzle on him.
it was very cop.
he's ready to make a statement as soon as we can draw up the paperwork to get him outta here.
nobody likes a snitch.
let's get him.
the drug bust in the cafeteria-- I know who talked.
Oh, yeah? Who? - Nick, the thief.
cop said he's giving you up next.
no, he's not.
you get me a knife. Just before lights out.
you be ready.
lab techs just finished going through the stuff we seized from Carwin.
Oh, yeah? - Yeah.
it's turning out to be a pretty nice case.
meth lab but a garage full of stolen stereos, and about 600 cartons of untaxed cigarettes.
looks like your dad came through for once.
wait. What?
I said it looks like your dad-- untaxed cigarettes?
yeah? So? - Cover for me. I gotta go.
kind of busy here, boy. - Your lead was crap.
butch Carwin didn't kill that guard, but he is smuggling cigarettes, like you.
that's a weird coincidence, huh?
I think I'll freshen this up. - Yeah, you should.
she lied for you to help take out a rival.
only thing a cop's ever good for-- getting rid of the competition.
besides, you got yourself a nice, big bust for you and the redhead.
everybody's happy.
you used me.
Hey, what's family for?
you know?
I think your mom-- don't talk about my mom. Shut up. You shut up!
well, now...
thinking that maybe taking a punch at the old man will fix you up right?
give you some inner peace?
but before you swing, you remember what I said before.
I don't do fistfights.
come ahead, son.
locking up in 15 minutes, gentlemen.
kill that snitch.
drop the knife, Lansdale.
don't make me have to pepper-spray your ass.
you know the drill.
this enough to send him to supermax?
I gotta say, walton would have liked to have seen this.
don't worry. We'll pack your bags for you.
yeah? Well, you can all go to hell.
and that goes double for Nick.
it's all over this place that he was the one snitching on me.
get him outta here.
get him outta here.
I know somebody's gonna get that rat!
take him outta here. Lock the cellblock down.
you better move Nick to an isolation unit.
we put him in the laundry room on the night shift.
let's go.
time's up, Nicky.
Nick? Where'd Nick go?
you seen nick? - He was just at the desk.
well, he's not now.
we've got a missing convict. Put us on lockdown.
is it a rabbit?
Yeah, it's a rabbit.
rabbit dancing?
rabbits don't dance.
Cho, got our laundry truck.
guys, light it up.
sir, I'm gonna need you to step out of the vehicle.
Olly, olly, oxen free!
I had to run.
you made everyone think I was a snitch.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry about that.
my bad, but I just thought it was the best way for you to show us how you sneak in and out of prison.
just like you did the night you killed Walton.
I got nothin' to say.
well, we have ways of making you talk.
what the hell are you doing here?
keeping warm.
you burn my whole stash?
Yup.
hard-core.
I do you. You do me, and that's the way it should be.
so does that make us even?
no.
all right, son.
just this once.
I'll give you a fair chance.
too much damn cop in you, boy.
we're not done yet.
should've used the knife.
see you around, son.
the laundry truck driver is in the other room singing like a bird.
save us some time and talk, and we'll move you to the east coast where nobody knows you're a snitch.
I never snitched.
this guy here made that up.
Oh, well, have fun explaining that to the boys on the cellblock.
what the hell.
I'm cooked, right?
I was supposed to get out in six months.
I wanted to have something waiting for me.
so I found that jewelry store in town.
I promised that driver a share if he'd sneak me out.
Yes, his poor taste in jewelry was a very early clue.
so I robbed the place.
it went smooth.
so I figure, let's do another one.
and that's when you ran into Walton.
kid didn't have to be a hero.
he could've just left it alone.
that's just how he was, you know?
he had to try and do the right thing.
thought I got away clean.
well, I figured someone that was getting in and out of prison must have the trust of the guards, hence a trustee, and the laundry
well, that's just the smartest way out.
that could have been any one of us.
Yes, but you and jorge stood out.
that's why I chose you both.
his tattoo was far better work than the average prison work you see, and fresh.
then he mentioned his cousin, the artist, which leaves you and your perfectly manicured digits.
there's not a nail salon in prison, is there?
I like to look right.
I'm old school.
I never killed anyone on any of my jobs.
I never had to.
I was too good to need violence.
but still, you took a knife with you.
someone stands in front of you, gonna take away everything, you gotta put him down.
I mean, right or wrong, you put him down.
you get that.
don't you?
what happened to you tonight? Something with your dad?
Yeah.
I was gonna make coffee.
do you wanna go to the shop down the street, talk about it?
no, I'm fine.
I'm better than fine, actually. - All right.
wait. There's just one more thing.
I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna be at your wedding.
that's too bad.
you have something else planned that day?
no.
you see, the problem is...
I'm still in love with you.
you can't-- hold on.
I'm not trying to win you back.
you're marrying a good man.
that's not gonna change.
but neither am I.
this whole thing where we pretend that we're just friends-- it--it doesn't work.
I don't know if it will work, but I know one thing.
I can't watch you marry another man.
all right.
you have a good day...
and a good life.
northeast Sacramento
Jane? Care to join us?
the moon's at perigee, closest to the earth.
it's beautiful, isn't it?
Yes, it is, but the victim is over here.
I know.
work.
victim's name's Eleanor Artega, shot in the chest.
there were reports of gunshots around 11: 00.
is she from the neighborhood?
ID gives an address across town, but one of the SACPD officers said she grew up in the neighborhood.
her mother runs a grocery a few blocks away.
pretty dress.
maybe she was wedding?
performance, more like it. She's a musician.
some kind of stringed instrument. - Because?
because of the calluses on her fingertips and the faint piney scent of rosin on her dress.
been a couple of gang initiation could be another one.
I'll talk to the SACPD gang unit, see who's active.
we'll canvass the looky loos.
hydrangea petal.
interesting decoration for a gang slaying, unless the crips have taken up flower arranging,
which I can definitely see the therapeutic benefits of.
thank you.
evidence, I believe.
come on.
and I'm looking for current information on norte ?
call me back as soon as possible. Thanks.
damn, man. You see I'm walking here, right?
you walked into me. - Hell I did.
you need to get behind the line. Police only here,
trying to find out who killed that lady?
you know somethin' about it?
do I look like a snitch to you?
keep walkin'.
go on.
anything would be useful, so if you wouldn't mind, just...
just give us a call and, uh, thank you very much for your time.
I know it's slow, but it's how the work is done.
Yeah, I could point out someone that knows something useful with 25 words or less.
Oh, really?
count 'em.
evening.
I have $100 for information about the victim.
100.
Oops.
it's not $100.
just $1...
for information.
any takers?
25.
the point being...
the gentleman in the plaid shirt with the beanie didn't even consider raising his hand.
that means he has information that not even $100 can buy.
sir? Uh, you in the plaid, We're gonna have to ask you some questions.
Cho, we got a runner! Get the car! Head off around the block!
someone took my keys.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop the car!
thanks for the ride, sucka!
come on, Starsky, let's go get him. I'll drive.
gonna walk home?
ms. Artega, we're very sorry for your loss,
but we need to ask you some questions about your daughter.
I have work to do.
ma'am, what did Eleanor do for living?
she was a concert violinist with the orchestra.
dawn, I sad the first shelf for these.
sorry, Ms. Artega.
first chair violin,
the concertmaster,
second to the conductor himself.
youngest in symphony history.
you must have been very proud.
proud, yes.
I was her manager. We were a team.
do you know why Eleanor was in the neighborhood last night?
she came here.
she had given a solo performance,
a special event. She wanted to tell me about it.
can you think of anyone who may have wanted to harm her?
a boyfriend maybe?
she wasn't seeing anyone. No time.
she used to have a boyfriend.
gangbanger.
they dated about a year or so.
why would he want to hurt her?
Eleanor broke it off six months ago.
he wouldn't leave her alone.
he called, came to the apartment.
we had to get a restraining order! Ay!
mop!
how am I gonna clean this up?
how am I gonna...
Oh, my Ellie!
Oh, my baby.
why did they do this to you?
Why?!
Hey, boss.
so I confirmed that Eleanor Artega played a private event the night that she was murdered, "A brescian stradivarius violin."
I'm assuming that's a good one. What about the boyfriend?
orlando Yglesias. He's got a sheet, some low-Level stuff.
he runs with a Norte the, uh, Lincoln Avenue hermanos.
Eleanor did have a restraining order on him.
this is the guy that fled the scene last night,
the one that Jane picked out from the crowd.
call SACPD gang unit.
tell them we need any help they can give finding this guy.
okay, you got it.
we've got a little homicide investigation going on here.
you care to join us?
Yeah, I'm--I'm a little busy right now.
brahms's concerto in D minor.
Eleanor's the soloist. She's very good, very elegant, uh, rubato.
music later.
we have a viable suspect-- The victim's ex-boyfriend.
wild goose chase, I hope.
you hope? Why?
well, because if it is, the boyfriend is boring, tragic, but dull, which is to be avoided at all costs.
where you going?
you Cho? - That's right.
beller, SACPD.
I picked him up on Bellwood in the northwest.
got your car, too. It's on its way.
Thanks. Juvenile services is?
they're backed up. They can't process him for 48 hours at the least.
social worker says his mother passed away.
his father's in jail.
she thinks we should release him back to his foster family.
what gang put you up to this?
I don't belong to a gang.
stealing a cop car. That's an initiation.
you're jumping in with somebody. Who?
beasty mob? True heights villains?
sir, I don't know ?
hang on to him. Juvenile services'll get to him eventually.
Yeah. No, I have a court appearance today.
I gotta unload him. He's all yours.
I okayed it with your boss already.
you're joking.
no joke.
thanks for your help, officer Beller. We appreciate the assist.
no problem.
boss...
SACPD are not babysitters.
he stole your keys. He's your problem.
make sure he doesn't take anything else.
sir, you gotta believe me when I say how sorry I am.
don't talk.
no, really, I'm sorry. - Not buying it.
come on.
whatever, punk.
that's more like it.
Mr. Jane?
Hi. I'm kieran carruthers, the company's outreach assistant.
front office said I might find you here.
Yes, I'm the principal oboist.
definitely Oboe-Esque.
concertmaster sits, uh, here, yes?
Yes. - Mm.
interesting bookmark.
Yeah, looks like an expensive one.
Really?
you know, if you tell me what you're looking for, I might be able to help.
I'm looking for a killer.
Eleanor's killer? Here?
you're musicians, professional obsessors.
most kids spend their teen years having fun.
you spent them practicing scales.
it's a noble pursuit, but as a result, you're all a little nutty.
well, uh, okay, I don't know ?
there's a definite air of unrest in the room.
what is that about?
right. We're supposed to start our season a day after tomorrow.
opening night, big fund-raising meet and greet with our donors.
some of us thought we should postpone because of Eleanor, but the, uh, maestro didn't agree.
your conductor--a tyrant?
Vincent Manheiser. I wouldn't say he's a tyrant.
he's just... not nice.
all right, let's get to work.
see for yourself.
come on, people. Let's go.
haven't got all day. Up, up, up. Come on.
all right.
Yes, maestro?
you will take Eleanor's seat as concertmaster.
you've not shown any of her natural gifts of leadership,
but under the circumstances, we shall have to make do, yes?
I'll do my best, sir.
your keen lust for advancement will be gratified.
second seat for you.
Yes, maestro.
from the top.
and...
Yep. Orlando Yglesias.
okay. Thanks.
gang unit's gonna ask around,
check out where the victim's ex-boyfriend hangs.
good.
there you go.
I can't eat this.
why not?
I'm a vegetarian.
now it's vegetarian.
Hey. Pick it up.
you better not mess with Cho, man.
he used to be an Avon Park playboy.
you were a playboy? - Oh, yeah. That's right.
runs with the south side mafia.
never heard of him. I'll be right back.
Yeah.
Wayne, I'm getting coffee. Want some?
uh, no, thanks.
Hey.
Hey.
what is this? - What?
I want you, baby. Come to me?
is this some kind of a joke?
I didn't send that.
well, it's on your phone. - Well, my phone is on my desk.
Hey. Who's watching the kid?
Hey!
nice try.
let's go.
I had him. - Yeah.
you can't do this. I'm a minor.
too bad.
I know I shouldn't have messed with you.
I can't be here.
I gotta go, for real.
gang unit just called back.
they say Orlando's crew hangs at 8th and market.
we should go sit on it.
you're looking for Orlando Yglesias, right?
I know him. He's from the neighborhood.
you ain't gonna find him at 8th and market.
why not?
cause that's where the hermanos hang.
Orlando's not with them no more.
gang unit says different.
they don't know.
jumped into a new gang a couple months ago.
yeah? Which one?
cut me loose, and I'll tell you.
the local pimps.
house on Lex and Tremont. That's their spot.
gang unit says the information's six months old.
kid could be right.
wouldn't hurt to check it out.
Lex and Tremont's close.
if Orlando doesn't show up, we'll swing by the other location.
let's go.
you're dragging, people!
stay in tempo!
stop! Stop. Stop.
B-Flat? It's ridiculous, even for you.
while we're on the subject, Ann, Carol, you're dragging.
trumpets, measure 37.
soggy.
I thought it sounded perfectly lovely. Bravo.
you're awfully picky, aren't you?
who are you?
never mind. Go. Leave now.
I'm with the CBI. I'm here about the murder.
uh, if you'll please wait outside...
you hate being interrupted, don't you?
as a matter of fact, I do.
interesting. I have one question, then I'll leave.
I know it was you that murdered Eleanor Artega.
I just need to know why, Vincent.
why did you kill her?
you are crazy. - Aha.
that is exactly--exactly what I thought you would say, now I know for sure.
Yes.
you, sir, are a cold-blooded murderer...
and you will get what you deserve.
I did not kill Eleanor Artega.
are you sure of that? - Very sure.
Meh. Well, it's worth a try.
worth a try?
Yeah, the old "it was you" gambit.
guilty people often fold up at that point...
guilty people with a conscience, that is, which means you're either innocent,
or you're a cold, heartless monster...
or both.
this is an outrageous abuse of authority.
it still might be you, and if it is...
justice will find you.
what?
we're wasting our time.
Orlando's not gonna show up. The kid played us.
sounded like he knew what he was talking about.
he knows how to sell it.
Ah, he doesn't seem that bad to me.
I used to be that kid.
any chance to mess with a cop, I'd do it.
Hey, check it out.
that's Orlando, isn't it? - Yeah. Go. Go.
let me see your hands. Do it.
tell me about Eleanor.
orlando, you want to talk after spending the night in a holding cell, that's your right.
but tomorrow morning, I am still gonna be asking you the same questions.
what you want to know?
you were an unlikely couple.
Eleanor was in the orchestra. She was moving her way up.
you weren't. Then she dumps you.
must have been stressful.
did it make you angry?
Yeah, here we go, jamming me up for this.
I'm just askin'.
I wasn't angry.
Eleanor was all about music, always.
wasn't gonna let me or anyone else get in the way of that.
I respected that.
then why'd you keep calling, going over to her apartment?
we were cool.
there was no reason not to hang.
except a restraining order.
her mother made her do that. She told me.
her mom thought I was moving in again 'cause I came by a couple times.
if you're such a stand-up guy, why did you run from the crime scene?
I wouldn't hurt El.
didn't want nothin' but good for her.
believe it, don't...
I don't control you.
I talked to the clerk of the judge who issued the restraining order.
Orlando's right.
Eleanor did ask for it, but her mother was the driving force.
that's not what Isabella said.
also, I checked Eleanor's e-mails.
Eleanor fired Isabella as her manager and hired a new one just a couple weeks ago.
new manager says Eleanor and her mother weren't speaking.
they spoke before she died. Go talk to Isabella again.
find out what they really said.
okay, I'm on it.
you sleep here.
the door will be locked, but there's someone down the hall.
you need anything, just bang on the door, okay?
but I'm leaving tomorrow, right?
depends on when juvenile services gets here.
juvenile services?
we had a deal. - There was no deal.
come on, man. Don't punk out on me.
I'm not kidding. I need to get out of here.
well, you should have before you stole a car.
no, I've got business. - It'll have to wait.
let me go!
get off of me, man!
Hey. Stop. Stop. - Get off of me, man!
look at me. Look at me.
what's this really about?
hmm?
I'm not leaving until you tell me.
my dad got arrested.
they say he robbed a liquor store, but he didn't.
all right.
he didn't.
he's got an alibi.
dude named Jayden Stephens.
but Jayden won't come forward.
he's got warrants out on him, so he's hiding.
but my dad's going on trial next week.
I can't find Jayden, my dad's going to prison.
that's why i stole your car.
Jayden's running with the true heights villains.
I was thinking if I can jump in with them,
they'd tell me where he's hiding.
figured they'd know.
you were joining a gang to get your father out of prison.
Yeah.
try to get some sleep.
we know Eleanor fired you as her manager.
why didn't you tell us that?
I didn't think it was important.
well, you must've talked about it the night Eleanor came here and she was killed.
we did.
she wanted to make up. I didn't.
I should've, but I didn't.
so the last time you spoke, you fought?
are you asking if I killed my daughter?
no, ma'am, I'm just trying to get the facts straight.
Yes, she is.
I mean, come on, you are.
most kids never make it out of this neighborhood.
Eleanor did, because I gave her everything so she could have a better life.
why would I hurt her?
grace, it's clear as day.
Isabella had nothing to do with her daughter's death.
more importantly, was Eleanor into cats?
cats? No.
what about ancient egypt, Pyramids? Mummies?
no. She never talked to me about Egypt.
okay. Thanks. Let's roll.
so to all our donors, our board members,
our most loyal supporters,
I say thank you.
is that for Ariel?
more of a red wine girl, I would think.
how'd you know this was for her?
well, clearly, you've got a thing for her.
word to the wise-- She likes the bad boys.
Oh, you're back. - Mm.
don't let Vincent see you.
I think I can take him.
so can I watch? That was fun last time.
this is not a joke, Ariel. I'm following up on an important clue.
it could very well break the case.
well, come on.
you're gonna tell us, right?
he can't, Ariel. - Oh, we won't say anything.
promise. - I'd like to know.
well, I suppose you're gonna hear soon enough.
Eleanor was in a relationship with someone from the orchestra.
I suspected as much.
who was it?
uh, I can't.
it couldn't be Douglas, could it?
think bigger. That's all I'm saying.
it wasn't...
no.
are you serious? - Deadly.
Mm.
and he was abusing her...
sexually.
that's awful. - Yes. Shh.
Oh, my... - I don't see it.
Mr. Rome, I'm Kimball Cho with the CBI.
your son Anthony tells me you're innocent of the charge you're facing.
is that true?
Anthony told you that? - Yeah.
how you know my son?
that's not important right now.
I'm giving you a chance to say you didn't do the crime.
you're not gonna take it?
no. No, I didn't do it.
da says you did.
Yeah, a store owner picked me out of a lineup.
bad witness ID. That's all.
but you know how hard that is to beat, right?
and you've robbed a lot of stores, haven't you?
not anymore. That is all behind me.
since when?
since Anthony's mother passed about a year ago.
I've been trying to step up, do better.
look, I even got a new construction job.
and you run with the south side mafia.
how do they feel about you stepping up?
I'm jumping out as soon as I put all this behind me.
you've had a year to jump out. What are you waiting for?
man, the hell with you!
you don't know me!
da offered you two years.
you could do that much time easily.
why'd you turn it down?
two years of my boy in foster care, out there on the streets? He would be dead or in a cell with me.
no. I been gone too long.
I have got to get outta here.
tell me about Jayden Stephens.
I got your message.
just in time. The fun will soon begin.
what's going on?
Ahem. It's just horrible, isn't it?
what is, ma'am?
our conductor...
has been having an illicit relationship with our poor, dear Eleanor.
no. - Yes.
and he hit her.
Allison! Excuse me. - You're excused.
you. Why?
lure out the real lover.
Oops. Gotta go.
and you know this because?
cats and Egypt-- Eleanor wasn't into them.
the bookmark--She didn't buy it for herself, and it's too expensive for a casual gift.
someone was trying very hard to impress her.
now thanks to the rumor mill, that person thinks that Vincent was sleeping with Eleanor.
add in a couple of glasses of champagne, and if I haven't missed the mark...
you son of a bitch.
I have no idea what you're talking about. - Don't lie to me.
go home and sober up.
that's enough! Get off of him! Come on!
now. Break it up! Break it up now!
break it up.
break it up! Enough! Enough!
let me know if you need me to call for backup.
Constance, we know you bought Eleanor that bookmark.
we found the charge on your credit card records.
you were in love with her, weren't you?
Yes, I was.
when did you tell her?
a few weeks ago.
she was really, really nice, but...
she wasn't interested.
did that upset you?
I suppose a little.
Mm. You have a temper, don't you?
no. Hardly at all.
Oh, you got pretty angry at Vincent.
that was different.
I-I thought...
I heard Vincent hurt Eleanor.
I... I didn't think that was right.
and what about the night Eleanor died?
did you have a temper then?
you knew she was playing that night.
it wouldn't have been that hard to follow her.
you can't be serious.
I don't think the fact that Vincent had abused Eleanor is what upset you.
I think you couldn't stand her being with somebody else.
no.
all right, then explain this for me then.
why was the gun that killed Eleanor in your car?
what?
a few hours ago, we found it in your trunk.
that isn't mine.
It's...Th-That's not mine. It isn't.
that's not really an explanation of how it got there.
I...I-I want a lawyer.
please.
so... Constance.
we're charging her.
then we can all rest easy.
Mm.
say it.
she didn't do it.
we found the weapon in her car.
didn't do it.
unless you have actual evidence that exonerates her, we have to charge her.
if she were the killer, she would have exhibited some measure of guilt.
all I observed was sincere grief.
actual evidence.
okay. The gauntlet's been thrown down.
when you searched Constance's car, did you notice any flowers?
no. Why?
she's all yours.
Hey, Osvaldo.
how's it going in the DA's office?
not so good.
we need to talk about agent Cho.
Ardiles is prosecuting Rome.
I'm told you visited Rome in jail. Is that true?
why do you wanna know?
why...
uh, because Mr. Rome's lawyer has sent me an updated witness list with the name Jayden Stephens on it, which is interesting, because as far as i can tell, Jayden Stephens is a convenient figment of Mr. Rome's imagination.
but now according to Mr. Rome's lawyer, even though you have nothing to do with this,
you said you'd track down this Mr. Stephens,
thereby providing Mr. Rome with an alibi, potentially screwing my case.
that's why I need to know, agent Cho.
answer him.
Yes, I did that.
agent, do you know who, uh, Asante James and Rodrick Pierce are?
no.
well, they're only the, uh, top two lieutenants in the south side mafia.
probably a dozen bodies on each.
lawrence Rome worked with them.
you want Lawrence to flip?
well, that's the idea. - Lawrence won't flip.
Really? Why not? - He knows they'd kill him.
right. And you know so much about that?
more than you, I guess.
agent, do I have to take this upstairs? Because i'm ready.
no, you don't.
Hey, this is not our case.
Rome's attorney or the DA's office can look for Jayden Stephens.
we should not get involved.
good.
then we're in agreement.
we shouldn't get involved.
got it.
Where's the kid?
juvenile services just took him.
let go of me, man. Man, let go of me!
listen, zip your mouth. - Let go of me!
Hey! Hold on. - Listen to me, pal.
easy, son, easy.
what's up? - I'm agent Cho.
I'll take the kid off your hands. - What?
I made a mistake. Let's just forget i filed a report, okay?
it's my case now.
besides, it took me an hour to get here.
I'm not going back empty-handed.
now do you mind?
Hey, hey.
give him to me. - Sorry. Can't do that.
he hit you. That's battery.
are you kidding me?
I have to process him now. Paperwork.
hold on. - Bye.
Hey. This is bull!
what are you doing, man? - Be quiet or I'll give you back.
I thought the police work was over.
Oh, I just stopped by to congratulate you.
I'm sorry. Me?
you are the new concertmaster, aren't you? Now that constance is in the pokey.
Thanks.
it's not exactly something that deserves congratulations.
when you heard about the promotion, what was the first thought that popped into your head?
sadness... relief.
you know, just last week I was thinking of leaving here and trying my luck elsewhere.
now... - mm.
well, you got what you wanted.
you're pleased and... yet you feel guilty.
it's perfectly understandable.
I need to get back to rehearsing.
don't mind me.
excuse me.
do you know if there's a good florist nearby?
who wants to know?
Hey, CBI. Let me see your hands.
all right.
we're gonna talk about Lawrence Rome.
we can talk. Let's talk.
get up.
what the hell's going on here?
get outta the way. - Or what?
keep breathing. You'll be fine.
for you.
does it squirt water?
no. No trick.
maybe just a little trick. Catch the killer.
with a hydrangea? - Yeah.
how?
well, wouldn't that be spoiling the fun?
for you. Spoiling the fun for you.
we're dropping charges against Lawrence Rome.
I see.
personally, I think the alibi is bogus, but we had to interview the store owner again.
now he says, uh, maybe his ID was wrong.
maybe it wasn't Lawrence Rome.
whole thing's gone down the toilet.
we had an agreement.
I agreed I shouldn't help. Didn't say I wouldn't.
from now on, you get nothing from the DA's office.
no favors, no help.
not just you, but every agent in this unit.
you have screwed things for your people, my friend.
six months from now, Lawrence Rome will be back inside for ripping off another liquor store, his kid'll be back in foster care, and the south side mafia will be stronger than ever.
you're wrong.
you wanna bet on that?
on the stage, on the other side of the stairs.
Oh, no, no, no, no!
stop! Stop! Stop!
you're my rock! Never a wrong note. What is going on?!
I'm sorry, maestro, just...
I'm not feeling very well.
what is the matter?
I can answer that.
what's he doing here?
fabulous suit, by the way.
Kieran's not so much feeling sick as he is feeling guilty.
sick with guilt because it was him that killed Eleanor.
come on.
hydrangeas don't lie.
well, if they could speak, they wouldn't lie.
what are you talking about?
somebody gave Eleanor a bouquet of hydrangeas the night of the murder.
after you shot Eleanor, you swiped them,
leaving behind a single petal.
and when you saw them, you couldn't help remembering that night.
you felt guilty.
it killed your concentration.
because you framed her.
precisely.
the question remains why would a man kill the first chair violinist?
and then frame the second chair?
because with the first and second chair out of the picture, the third takes first.
Kieran here has a little crush on you.
well, let's not beat around the bush here, Kieran.
it's more of an obsession.
he'd heard that you'd been thinking about leaving the orchestra.
then he would lose you.
so he had to shake things up.
it's not true. Okay, this is because I played a few wrong notes?
this is crazy!
it was just a feeling that he had, a little hunch.
he always had faith in you.
you stay away from me.
no, Ariel. Wait, Ariel, wait. No, no. Wait. Wait.
Ariel, listen. No, Ariel. No! - Calm down.
I just want to make you happy! - That is enough.
maestro, take five. - Okay.
Eleanor was nothing compared to Ariel.
she didn't have the technique.
so after rehearsal that night, I followed Eleanor to her performance.
why'd you take the flowers?
he didn't think Eleanor deserved them. Isn't that right?
ariel is ten times the player.
she deserved the recognition.
if I had to give it to her, so be it.
very gallant.
still, I wouldn't expect a conjugal.
dad!
Oh, what's up, man?
I missed you so much.
Oh! Look at you. God, look at you.
come on.
I missed you.
all right. Give me a minute.
I talked to the gang unit.
if you haven't jumped out in a month, they'll let me know.
I said I would.
you have a chance. Don't mess it up.
what's this punk saying to you, dad?
easy. Easy, little man. We just--We just talking.
Hey, Cho. We got a new one. We're heading out in a minute.
Thanks, Mr. Rigsby.
I really appreciate everything.
uh, yeah. Um, no problem.
that was weird. I barely talked to the kid.
check your pockets.
my wallet. Damn it!
hold the elevator!
mind if I...
you all set for tomorrow? - 12: 00 sharp. We're ready.
you talking about lunch? That sounds civilized.
you got the memo. We're talking about the mandatory seminar on budget protocols.
have fun with that. - You're coming, too, jane.
uh, you're joking, of course. I-I don't do seminars.
well, you do when they're mandatory. - No, I'm a consultant.
too bad. They're checking attendance. You have to sign in.
okay then. Um... "Patrick Jane."
just, uh, copy that down for me.
forge your signature? That's against the rules.
is it? I'm not gonna tell anyone.
I understand your precarious emotional state, given you've just gotten your job back, and your sensitivity to the bureaucrats that are watching your every move.
they are. - Yes, but that's your thing.
I gotta be me. I can't change who I am.
no, but you can change where you are tomorrow at 12: 00.
it's not gonna happen.
you think this is funny?
we got a missing child-- marin county.
snatched from a school bus stop two hours ago.
the mother asked for us specifically. Rigsby is gonna meet us downstairs.
van Pelt, set up a command post here. Liaise with the marin sheriff.
tell him we're on our way.
it's good to have her back.
Yes, it is.
our missing boy-- 9 years old, only child.
another kid was walking to the bus stop, and he saw a vehicle peeling out with our boy Conner Flint in it.
the man behind the wheel was wearing a hoodie.
description on the vehicle? - Big and dark.
the kid's only 8 years old.
could it be a custody kidnapping?
the woman was widowed two years ago. Her husband died of cancer.
looks like there's family money, but there's no ransom demand yet.
start with the bus stop? - Yeah, you and Cho.
Jane and I will question the family.
what's the mother's name? - Elizabeth Flint.
thank god you're here. - Hello, Beth.
I have everything ready for the reading.
I'm gonna do everything I can to help, Beth, I promise, but, uh, I need to you know, I'm--I'm not a psychic anymore.
what? Wh-what do you mean?
well, I mean, I'm not...
well, I-I never really was a psychic.
no, I'm not--wh no, what are you what are you saying?
no, I-I know that--that you--you are.
look, you... Please. Please help me find Connor.
you--you have a connection with him...
Beth. - So let's can we get started?
um, I have this locket, and it has his picture in it. - Excuse me, ma'am. I'm sorry.
Patrick, I'm so happy you're here. - Ma'am. Would you excuse us for a moment?
I-I'm sorry.
she's an old client.
uh, yeah.
this is a mess we don't have time for.
that boy is out there somewhere, and this psychic stuff is a distraction.
I think you'd better leave. - Can't say I disagree.
hello. Is Beth inside?
and you are... I'm agent Lisbon. We're with the CBI.
Nathan Glass.
when Beth called me and told me about connor, I came over right away to see what I could sense.
sense? - I'm Beth's spiritual advisor.
a psychic? - Yeah. She's expecting me. Excuse me.
second thought...
San Angelo Elementary Bus Stop
forensics found the kid's phone in the bushes over there.
has the amber alert gone live? - Yep. No tips yet.
deputies shut down the surrounding streets right after Connor went missing.
there's some unpaved trails in the woods that maybe a vehicle could get through.
we got checkpoints up, but...
Hey, Van Pelt, we get a ransom demand yet?
no, and I don't think we're going to.
there have been two other abductions in the bay area with a similar m. o.
young boys snatched while waiting for the bus - But there were balloon animals found at those scenes, And they think that's how the guy lured the kids.
what happened to those boys?
M. E. estimates both boys were strangled approximately 12 hours after they vanished.
which means Connor has only about eight hours.
I talked with Connor about safety all the time.
you know, i-if a stranger grabs you, just kick, punch, scream, anything to get away.
you know, I-I... I told him.
Shh. It's not your fault.
you taught him well. Everyone who knows you knows that you're a perfect mom.
how well did you know Connor?
Beth and I have been working together for two years, since her husband passed over.
I feel like I've watched him grow up.
Connor's such a great kid. He's kind and funny and smart.
Beth, uh, did Connor always take the bus to school?
it--it was Deke's idea-- uh, my brother.
um, he thought it would do Connor good.
Deke Hutton. He lives here.
um, yes, ever since James died, and--and I-I agreed with him about the bus.
you know, I-I didn't want Connor to grow up sheltered, and Jonathan supported it, too.
jonathan is my, um, my grown stepson.
he's, um, Connor's brother.
you know, he-- actually, he owns this house.
he's letting Connor and me stay as long as we want.
nice guy.
and where are Deke and Jonathan now?
um, they're with our--our bankers.
if... If this is, uh, a-a ransom-type thing, I-- we would need to have a lot of cash.
Yes, if it is.
you you--you-- you can find him.
you--you and Nate, you can work together.
I know that you can-- I know you can see where he is, so...
so--so that we--we can bring him home.
Mr. Glass, would you excuse us?
Beth, don't worry. I'll be outside, okay? - Okay.
Beth, please have a seat.
okay. Just breathe and relax. I need you to hear this, okay?
I'm not a psychic. I never was.
I was a con artist.
I took your money, and I told you lies.
no, they--they weren't lies.- Yes.
no. No. You-- you know they weren't.
no, i-if you're if you're not a psychic, then--then why are you working with the police?
ma'am, mr. Jane is working with us because he is an excellent investigator.
he is gonna be very helpful in this. I promise.
I understand.
i-it must be a terrible burden-- the gift you have.
of course you have to deny it.
I mean... Even St. Peter denied who he was three times.
Beth, there are no such thing as psychics. This man Glass...
it must be awful... - He's a fraud, too.
knowing what's gonna happen. I mean, if--who's gonna live and who's gonna die, but please, please...
please don't deny your gift. Not now. No.
you have-- you have to help me. You have to help me find Connor.
here, look. I have this locket, and it has his-- his first haircut.
look at this. Touch this. See if you can get a sense.
if this is from his - no, Beth.
this is from his first haircut...And Touch this. - No.
Mrs. Flint.- Please--no! My--no!
my son--no! My son is missing. My son is missing!
you have to you--you have to find him! You have to.
Mrs. Flint, please just-- let's just sit down for a minute, please. Here.
calm down, okay? It's okay.
Patrick, I don't...
Why?
sources inside the marin county sheriff's department confirm that connor flint, age 9,
no ransom demand has yet been made.
a CBI spokesman told this reporter that all leads and tips are being pursued and that police are looking for a possible suspect.
Yeah, because they'd go nuts if we told them we suspected a guy who's murdered two other boys.
you know they're calling this guy the "balloon man"?
media. Vultures.
Hey, I'm checking into pedophiles released before the first killing, looking for any escalating violence. Nothing so far.
good. Anything from forensics yet on trace from the bus stop?
Yeah, they said it's gonna take at least 24 hours.
okay. A serial offender.
this changes our whole play. We've got to work all three cases to find this guy.
I can check everything the local cops did in the first two.
maybe they missed something. - Work fast.
Mr. Flint, when was the last time you saw your little brother?
uh, this morning at breakfast.
we like to have breakfast together-- Beth, Connor, Deke, and me.
Connor had--had french toast. Everything was fine.
I-I... I can't believe this.
How's--how's beth doing?
not great.
how long ago did she marry your father?
um, 12 years ago.
how did you feel about that?
I like and respect Beth, if that's what you're getting at.
she's no wicked stepmother. I care deeply for her and connor.
well, if you care so much, how come you let her throw her money away on this, uh, psychic?
never bothered you when it was you, mr. Jane.
Yeah, I heard about you.
you nearly squeezed Beth dry.
and you are... - Connor's uncle, Deke Hutton.
and you should have gone to jail, you miserable sleazebag.
well, nice to meet you, too. I'm not sure that I'm a sleazebag.
that's enough. We're here to find connor, got it?- Miserable.
Yeah. Sorry.
we're trying to put together connor's morning.
from what we understand, you dropped him off at his school bus stop, right?
Yeah.
and you left him there alone? - Yeah.
he wanted it that way.
he wanted to show his independence.
the other kids on the bus would make fun of him if he had somebody waiting with him.
it's such a safe neighborhood. He's always been fine.
so it was routine for you to, uh, leave him alone there?
Yeah. I told you. He wanted it that way.
Beth agreed.
if you think you're gonna pin this on me, then you are very much mistaken!
typical addict-- misdirected anger, persecution complex.
excuse me. I'm not an addict. - Uh, yes, you are. You both are.
You--gambling, hence the purple smudge on your thumb from the ticket stubs at the track and your need to live off your sister's money, and you--antidepressants-- the shiny skin, the dyspepsia.
some deep emotional need not being fulfilled, I would guess.
are we done here? - Just getting started.
thank you. We are.
jerk.
nice work.
so I dug up a few possible witnesses in the first two cases.
we got a power company guy on a job near the first killing, a teacher whose car broke down on the second, and the neighbor of the second kid, like that.
long shots. We'd do better using that psychic.
I thought you liked all that spiritual stuff. What about your psychic cousin Yolanda?
Yolanda's real. That guy's a fake.
good luck. - You, too.
Mr. walton, we understand the day the first boy vanished, you were checking a downed power line on martindale road.
Yep. That's what my records say.
you know, funny story about that. They told me it was a damaged overhead conductor.
turns out it was a blown transformer.
can you imagine? I mean, I could have taken out the entire grid.
think back. Did you happen to notice anything on your way to or from that job or maybe this child?
I'm not sure. What's the kid's name?
Reggie Miranda. He was the second victim.
your car got a flat tire on Teer's hill.
you remember seeing him at the bus stop?
well, that wasn't a flat tire per se.
more like, uh, I told my girlfriend that, so we'd be stranded, she could get a little friendlier, which she did, if you know what I mean.
high five. Come on. Give it up.
as I was leaving, there was this black S. U. V. nearly ran me off the road, which reminds me of another funny story...
black S. U. V., power company guy says there was a ding in the front bumper.
great. That narrows it down.
well, I think I can help you.
ten Years Ago
take my hand.
I want a baby more than anything.
Shh. I know. Just... Listen.
in the beyond, Beth, i see your baby.
he's the light of your life.
he? It's a boy. - Yes, a boy.
his name is Connor.
Connor? That-- that's my father's name.
a beautiful baby boy.
that was Connor's favorite when he was a baby.
you know, he doesn't play with it anymore, but I just-- I can't throw it out now.
you understand. - Yeah. Here.
you know, Deke thinks I'm an idiot about you.
I mean, Jonathan probably does, too, but he's too nice to say so.
you know, but they weren't there. They didn't--they didn't see your powers at work.
there was nothing to see.
women that are trying hard to have babies often succeed, and when they do, there's a 50/50 chance that it's a boy.
it was just a good guess. - No, you knew.
and what was i to say, you were never gonna have a child?
nobody wants a gloomy psychic.
you had a child. You lost her. I-I read about it in the papers.
murdered? - Yeah.
I'm sorry. - Yeah.
is that why you deny your gift? - No.
look, is Connor dead, too?
please. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about before, but please just tell me.
it's just us right now, but--now just- beth, I-I can't tell you.
you have to tell me. We're just - Beth. Oh, thank god.
I had a flash, and, uh...
Mr. Glass, I told you to stay downstairs.
Beth, I think I saw connor.
it was just a flash, but, um... - Oh, please, Beth, don't listen to this nonsense.
no, where is he? Where--where is he? Is--Is he alive?
I don't know. It was just a split second.
I need a vessel or... Connor's favorite.
from when he was a baby, of course. Of course.
nice read.
Mr. glass, let's go. - No, please, agent Lisbon.
please just no, Nate, tell me. Tell me. Go ahead.
Beth, it's all right. I'm here.
I need you to think with me, okay? I need you to think of Connor.
he's filling your heart.
he's filling your mind, okay?
Yes.
Yes, I see him.
he's very still.
he's dead? - No.
he's alive. Sleeping.
Connor, wake up!
can you hear me?! Your mother's here!
he's saying... "I love you, mo mo."
"mo mo." "mo mo." that's what he calls me.
what? - He calls me he calls me "mo mo.
Oh, god. I can't believe he's alive. Thank you.
Hallelujah.
Amen.
jonathan, he's alive. Connor's alive. Nate sensed him.
Oh, Nate sensed something all right--money.
what, you think glass was faking? - Of course he was.
Money-grubbin' bastard.- No, no, no. It was connor.
he--he called me "mo mo." that--that's his nickname for me.
N-nobody knew that.
that's exactly how the trick works, Beth.
you use a detail that no one could possibly know, except Nate Glass did know.
he's been in and out of this house for two years.
no, no, I--no, I don't think he knew that name. No, I-I......
how much money have you paid him since your husband died?
and how much more will you give him now that he can sense your son?
and then if Connor dies and Glass can contact his spirit, what won't you give?
Hey, don't say that. Don't you dare.
you're sick. Nate would never do that.
of course he would. Believe me. He would.
no, you don't know, Patrick. Apparently you don't know anything.
my son called out for me.
he's alive, but you won't believe it, because you can't stand what you are, so you just run away from yourself, and you hate anybody like you, and you hurt anybody who cares for you.
that doesn't mean I'm psychic. It just means that you're gullible and desperate.
what is wrong with you that you treat people like that?
Oh, you should have seen me ten years ago.
it's beautiful, huh?
it's all state forests that way.
nothing but bears and deer and elk.
you're pretty good. I'll give you that.
not great. Just... Pretty good.
what can I say? It's a gift. - Yeah.
see, here's the thing, Glass.
I played the same game myself, so normally I wouldn't tell you not to run your little scam.
well, it's not a scam. - Hush. It's a scam.
we both know it's a scam, but you stepped over a line.
this is police business. There's a child's life at stake here.
Yeah, that's why i'm here. - You don't want to push me.
back off this woman.
get out of here right now, or you're gonna regret it.
Yeah. I can understand your frustration.
you had the vision, and you lost it, and I...
I can't think of anything more horrible.
you got a lot of nerve.
maybe I've got you pegged all wrong.
maybe you're a kidnapper, too.
Yeah. No, he's not the balloon man.
I talked to Van Pelt.
during the first two abductions, he was in New york and Atlanta giving a presentation in front of a hundred people.
actually, it was 200. - yeah.
excuse me.
Jane, we don't have time for you to have a feud with this guy.
I-it's like your conscience is battling your old self.
there's no upside.
you think that's why I'm here? That's intriguing.
well, we have to go. A boy's life is on the line, and this man could take another kid and kill him.
Yeah. Let's go then.
so I've been trolling pedophile chat rooms.
there's this one guy, charlie95-- something's up with him.
he's a little too eager to chat about the first two boys.
are you tracking him? - Yep. I.T. says any minute now.
tell me you've got something better.
been looking into this black s. u. v. The power company guy saw, cross-checking to see if any registered pedophiles own one.
it's thin. - Yeah, it's thin.
we're not gonna make it, are we?
Jane, feel free to jump in any time.
I'm thinking.
the second boy, Reggie-- it's bothering me.
if he'd have gotten to the bus stop just three minutes later, he would have arrived at the same time as his classmate, and Reggie would still be alive today.
is that bad luck? - Or planning.
maybe the killer was watching for the perfect moment.
but how could anyone have watched the first kid?
his bus stop was in a cul-de-sac. It's not visible from the main road.
I've got a picture of the first crime scene somewhere here.
Charlie95 is Brady Walton, the power company guy we questioned.
it can't be a coincidence. - It isn't.
the killer was watching from above.
Walton is the balloon man. - Oh, my god. He was right here. We had him.
get Cho on the phone. Tell him we're moving in immediately. Let's go.
walton's registered four guns, including an a. k. No telling how many he's really got.
good to know. Here's how it's gonna work.
van Pelt and I are gonna take the three-four corner.
you and Cho are gonna take the one-two.
now be careful. The kid could still be in there.
you ain't gettin' me! Not gonna happen!
Lisbon, we're pinned. We're pinned on the two side.
take the three corner. Let me know when you're in position.
rigs, I got a clear path to the front door. Stand by.
it may be too late for me, but I ain't going to prison!
I ain't going quiet!
van Pelt, are you in position?
screw you, bi
everybody okay? - Find the kid.
I'm all right.
walton's down.
walton, stay with us. Where's the kid?
tell us.
Where's Connor?
how would i know? - He's lying. Gotta be.
boss, the house is clear. The kid's not in there.
Hey, Jane.
we got Walton. The kid's nowhere to be seen.
tell Rigsby to look in his left pocket. There should be a note.
rigs, is there a note in your left pants pocket?
"the balloon man didn't take Connor."
okay, so how did he do that?
Hey. So videotape puts Brady Walton at a 7-eleven across town while connor was being snatched.
damn it. - Yeah, Walton killed those other two boys, but he didn't take Connor.
we've got a copycat. - So Jane was right.
Jane was right.
I gotta find Lisbon. She's not in her office.
Hey, Grace, well done anyway.
you took down a seriously bad guy.
another day, another dollar.
Hey. You okay? - Yeah.
I feel pretty good actually.
I'm starting to enjoy shooting people.
gotcha.
no, you didn't. - Yes, I did.
you didn't get me. - I did.
Walton has an alibi for connor's abduction. How did you know?
well, something was just, uh, a little off.
the other kids walton killed were older. They had dark hair.
that's it? - Just a good guess.
why the hell didn't you tell me? - Would you have done anything differently?
probably not. Walton was bad.
then there's no need to be cranky.
so who took Connor?
don't know. I'm still working on that.
is he alive? - I hope so.
so we're back to square one on this one.
first principle--motive. Why would somebody vanish a 9-year-old boy?
to hide evidence he was beaten, maybe?
abuse? Meh. No.
this has the whiff of something more tangled, more interesting.
money? We dismissed it because there was no ransom demand, but there's other ways to get money.
Connor inherited half of your husband's estate, isn't that right, mrs. Flint--$20 million?
uh, y--uh, yes. It's being held in a trust until he turns 30.
Why? - And, uh, who inherits if Connor dies?
He's--no, he's just a little boy. He's not supposed to die at all. Wh...
according to the terms of the trust, you get everything.
are you saying that I-- that I killed my son?
the thing is, we looked into everybody in the family's financials.
jonathan's worth $30 million, but you need money, don't you, mrs. Flint?
I-I don't-- I don't know what you mean.
I-I don't know what I'm doing in this room.
according to the bank, you have $100, 000 in credit card debt.
you've spent everything your husband left you and then some.
I've made some-- some bad investments, and I-I'm just not very good with numbers.
I always relied on James for that.
could you please sit down?
thank you.
that must have been really stressful for you, your financial situation.
it's--it's very embarrassing.
I mean, I couldn't even tell Deke.
uh, could you excuse me?
her family's here with a lawyer. We gotta charge her or kick her.
maybe you snapped. It's understandable.
one weak moment, and you saw a way out.
if something were to happen to Connor, all your problems would be over.
if something happens to Connor, my life will be over.
please, please just help me find my boy.
are you okay? - I'm fine. I'm fine.
Hi. What did they want?
well, they a-asked me a lot of questions about money.
it was just stupid m's clean.
what was I thinking?
I was thinking,...
love is strange I was still thinking about a sandwich.
uh, you know who else is profiting from Connor's abduction?
who? - Nathan Glass.
uh, he alibied out for the first two kids, but not Connor, and maybe he took him to cement his relationship with Beth.
well, he's certainly heartless enough.
we'll get him in a room. - No, he'll just clam up.
what if we can get him to lead us to Connor?
that would be nice.
boss, forensics came back with the labs on Connor's school bus stop.
nothing? - Nope.
the only weird thing is, there were traces of white fir pollen in the spot where they think that Connor was grabbed.
there are no white firs there. Just pines.
all right. Thanks. - Okay.
Yes. Got it.
let's get out of here.
any news?
no, uh, listen, I just wanted to say I'm sorry for everything that's happened.
what's the matter?
nothing. Uh...bye. - Wait.
Beth. - Wait, wait. No, patrick.
when--when you--you grabbed my hand, you--something- uh, n-nothing happened at all.
something happened. Are you... - No!
no, no. Are you sensing something?
no. No. - Liar. Liar.
I see... There's a face.
what's wrong? - It's Connor.
it is? - Oh, my god.
Jane, what are you doing? - I don't understand.
he's standing right there in front of me.
Lisbon. - What is it?
Lisbon, I don't like this. I don't like this.
what's going on? - No. There's someone there. I see someone.
Oh, wait. Wait. There's someone.
Are--they're following.
they're gonna catch me.
sweating. - His abductor?
Oh, come on. This is crap.
I can't do it. I can't do it. He's just a little boy.
I-I... Connor.
Connor. - Yes, yes. Connor. Connor. Where is connor?
there's a--there's a light, and it dances.
it just dance-- it dances on the water.
it's dancing on the water. It's so beautiful. - Oh, god. Connor. Connor's near water.
it's a--it's a strong smell, like, uh...
spicy, like christmas, uh, trees. - Pine trees?
it's like pine trees, but different.
Oh, and the bad-- there's a bad smell, a bad taste.
pungent. Gunpowder. Yeah, it's gunpowder.
it's bad.
and you can almost see the house.
he's just surrounded. There's wood, wood and trees, and--and--and...
uh, he's in a cabin. It's not a cabin. It's a...
no, it's like a, uh, it's smaller, like a sh-- ohh.
I'm tired. - Jane.
wake up. Jane, wake up!
what happened? - I don't know.
I was gonna ask you that. That was weird.
no, I-I knew you could sense him.- Please don't touch me.
I knew you could sense him. - Don't touch me.
get all of your neighbors...and volunteers. - Yes.
Karl, I want you to call the sheriff's department.
Cho will lead the search of the state forest.
we'll start at the flint property line. One hour. One hour.
come on!
see, that's how you do a psychic reading, huh?
drop the knife! Do it now!
are you deaf? Drop it, Flint!
I wasn't gonna hurt him, I swear.
get on your knees. Put your hands on your head.
Connor? Connor. Connor, I'm agent Van Pelt.
I'm from the CBI. I'm here to help you.
are you okay? - Yeah.
I was just there looking for Connor.
this is all a big misunderstanding.
you wanted Connor dead.
you grabbed him and then made it look like a child murderer did it.
which part are we misunderstanding?
but you couldn't bring yourself to kill your baby brother face-to-face, so you left him in that duck blind-- no food, no water, no chance.
no, that's not true.
why would I want Connor dead? I don't need his money.
love.
you are in love with Beth.
what are you thinking?
uh, I was thinking... Love is strange.
Jane called this one right.
he was in love with beth, only she didn't see him that way, so how was he gonna change that?
kill her kid and then be there to comfort her, pick up the broken pieces.
No! I always planned on...
always planned what, Jonathan? What did you plan?
I had always planned to go get him and bring him back.
play the hero.
put on a mask, kidnap connor, then go find him later, rescue him.
and then Beth is filled with gratitude and falls into your manly arms.
bingo. - That's a dumb plan.
I was going to bring him back!
so what was the knife for?
I... I didn't...
planning is easy. Reality's a bit harder.
what if connor recognized you? What if Jane is psychic?
better just to make a clean break and kill the kid, right?
he is.
Jane's psychic... Isn't he?
Nah.
we followed you. You led us to Connor.
no. No, no, no. That's impossible.
the stuff mr. Jane said, that he saw connor, the--the trees, the smell of gunpowder, near a-a body of water-- it was all accurate.
how the hell did he do it?!
mom. Mommy! - Hi.
Hi, baby.
Oh, baby, you're home. You're home. You're safe.
Yeah, welcome home, buddy.
look at you. Oh, my god.
I'm just happy, okay?
you want some french toast? I made you some french toast.
french toast is for breakfast.
it's a special occasion.
come on. Come on.
congratulations, mr. Jane.
Yes, yes.
uh... You son of a bitch. You trying to steal my action?
Mr. glass, nice to finally meet you, and you got no action.
you're a disgrace to the profession.
that contact you faked with connor-- weak.
weak. - Bite me. That gag was seamless.
you see how she fell for it?
mo mo. Mo mo.
Thanks. That should do it.
excuse me?
and, uh, stop.
mo mo.mo mo.
Bye.
don't leave.
I won't. We'll be right over there.
so... You gonna tell me how you did it?
everything you said came true, but it was a trick, wasn't it?
Yeah.
how?
well, um... Being held not far from home...
uh, the police shut down the roads immediately after connor's abduction.
the lake-- there's always a body of water nearby, always.
there was, uh, white fir pollen found at, uh, at the bus stop, and where could you hide anyone in a forest?
hunting blind, hence the gunpowder, and I was watching Jonathan's face the whole time.
I could see whenever my guesses landed.
of course.
elegant.
you know, all those years ago, when you were a psychic and...
you were lying to me, telling me about my future
Yeah, I'm--I'm very sorry about that.
don't apologize.
you tried to tell me.
you deceived me, sure...
but you gave me hope.
thank you for that.
good-bye, Patrick.
Bye, Beth.
cheer up. - Oh, I'm cheery.
you heard her. You gave her hope.
I didn't give her hope. I sold her hope.
I think hope is worth it at any price.
what, are you running for office now?
okay, you know what? Uh, you're a wicked charlatan...And you're going to hell then.
that's more like it. I'll save you a seat by the fire.
Oh, I'm not going to hell.
Oh, you're not? - No.
you've made other arrangements, huh?
Yeah, where are you going?
do you really want to have this conversation?
you ready for some, uh, theological talk here?
I don't really want to have that conversation.
I thought you wanted to feel better and not worse.
Yeah, I'm gonna recline and have a little sleep.
okay.
gold
did you know that the sea air is a natural antihistamine? The salt clears the passages.
Cho. - What do we got?
he's a big-time divorce attorney.
it's hard to say which one of his many enemies would want him dead.
his speedboat's down there.
cause of death?
well, he's not...
dead yet. Somebody just threatened to make him that way.
threatened? Since when do we roll for death threats?
when the threatened man is a rich establishment lawyer with juice.
this one's on you, Cho.
apparently one of your confidential informants knows Creek.
she told him we could help.
summer? That's a nice name.
she's a working girl.
been A C.I. For a few weeks.
surprised she knows a high-end guy like creek.
she's moving up.
Yeah.
uh, Mr. Creek, w - we're walking to you now.
I'm sorry, sir.
it's a long drive from sacramento. We got here as soon as we could.
...Especially when I tell the police that's someone trying to kill me.
CBI needs to do something about these threats, or I will call my good friend, the attorney general.
it's a leg？
Uh...Was that a shark?
so much for professional courtesy.
so forensics finished their search of the water near the explosion and confirmed that the body parts belong to alton creek.
did they...Find them all?
most.
and the arson squad found traces of C-4 in the debris.
guy never knew what hit him.
at least he was dead when, you know, the shark ate him.
okay, um, anything else?
uh, time frame.
security cameras covering the yacht's berth were down for repairs between 11: 00 last night and 7: 00 this morning.
killer had to have planted the explosive then. Is that luck or planning?
don't know yet.
so who wanted this guy dead?
he's a divorce attorney. Who didn't?
does he have any family?
Nope. We're trying to find his law partner, Lawrence Dersh.
he's not at any of his three houses.
maybe Summer'll know. I asked her to come in.
Kimball Cho.
it's been a while.
you're late.
you know sharks can have up to 3, 000 teeth?
five rows of 'em.
are you gonna actually help on the case?
I could actually use your help, too.
special agent Darcy.
how's the Federal Authorities? I haven't seen you for, uh...
Since-what...
the Panzer business, right. Actually, that's why I'm here.
we just took over the case.
S.F.P.D. wasn't getting anywhere.
can I ask you a couple questions?
um, we're kind of - Oh, of course.
uh, whatever you need.
take a seat. I'll-I'll make tea.
is this an official inquiry? Cop to confidential informant?
you'll get paid.
now did Creek tell you who wanted to kill him?
wasn't that kind of relationship.
how's your back?
it's fine.
what was your relationship?
he used to be a client. We weren't close, but I liked him.
well, you seem to be one of the few.
Yeah, well, Al was...
abrasive.
he was a real lawyer, you know?
wasn't really happy unless he was arguing about something.
girlfriend?
new one every month.
you know his law partner - Lawrence Dersh?
no, not really.
but you know what?
al was bitching about Dersh last week, said they got in a fight over money or something.
could Dersh be the one who threatened Creek?
maybe. I mean, it was pretty hard-core.
you heard the threat?
no. I saw it.
we were coming back from this party, and it was sitting on his front doorstep.
a pig with a big old knife in his head.
I told him to go to the cops, but he said no.
but then a couple days later, he asked me if I knew any cops who were cool.
I couldn't think of any, so I told him to talk to you guys.
look, Red John was an accomplished killer, no doubt, and I applaud you for ridding us of him.
but he is not in the same league as the San Joaquin killer.
red John was a common sociopath - lazy, sloppy, delusional.
you really have no idea what you're saying.
and only a little while later...
the man who killed Panzer wanted it to look like Red John, whom you shot and killed last spring.
Lapsang Souchong.
I think you're gonna like it.
here we go.
your point?
well, it's an odd chain of events, isn't it?
Yeah, I guess.
odd happens.
what does it matter who killed panzer? It was the San Joaquin killer.
so you said, but I studied Panzer very carefully.
there's not a lot of evidence to support that.
not your kind of evidence.
he was the San Joaquin killer.
I agree.
it is possible, but his murderer still has to be apprehended.
Why?
because killing someone without government permission is wrong?
was there something that you wanted to ask, agent?
are you sure the man you killed was Red John?
Yes. I'm sure.
then we have a copycat.
can you think of anyone who would wanna do this?
someone that wanted to avenge Panzer's crimes, I'd imagine.
well, who else thought that he was the San Joaquin killer, aside from you?
good question.
you figure out the answer to that, I think you'll probably have your killer.
but surely the motive is to avenge the insult to Red John, right?
I mean, look at the...
the cutting patterns.
clearly, our suspect is someone who studied Red John obsessively.
well, r-red john...
he was the type to attract followers, um, a-admirers.
he had a particular style- A style that people wanted to- To copy, you know?
not unlike elvis.
all right. Thank for your time
I'm staying at the oakview inn.
if you can think of anything else, please give me a call.
agent Lisbon.
nice lady.
nice?
that's all you're gonna say? She's nice?
great legs.
don't you think it's time to tell the truth about Red John?
well, the truth is I killed Red John.
I mean, you can ask anyone.
it was on the news, Lisbon.
but you think he's alive.
I told you that.
you, Lisbon.
nobody else.
and it's better that way.
when why make him re-emerge?
you manipulated Panzer into insulting Red John so Red John would kill him.
I didn't know how else to stop Panzer.
he would have just kept on killing.
and now you've got the FBI asking awkward questions.
you've kept this from the team. It's not good.
well, it's lucky that they don't know, 'cause if they knew, they'd have to lie to the FBI, wouldn't they?
and this way, they can tell what they think is the truth.
do you know how messed up that sounds?
Yeah.
what is wrong with the simple truth - Telling people he's alive?
I told a jury that I shot him dead.
where does that leave me?
it's not good.
no, no, not great.
gold
their partner dies, and they hold an event.
nice.
Hey, so you're stranded on a desert island with Attila the Hun, Joseph Stalin, and a lawyer, and you got a gun, but it's only got two bullets.
what do you do?
you're telling a lawyer joke? - Yeah.
no.
lawrence Dersh. You're a tough man to find.
you're here about Alton.
awful thing. Just awful.
but business is business, right?
this is our yearly retreat, officers. It's been scheduled for months.
the employees are scared.
I have to show them that business is still strong even with Alton gone.
he'd want that, I promise you.
sir, where were you between 11: 00 p. m. and 7: 00 this morning?
sorry. Flag on the play.
my client won't be answering any questions right now.
your client?
I work with Larry at the firm.
white-collar crime.
fast track to partnership, right, Colette?
Yeah, if you play your cards right.
no, uh, in-house dating, Larry.
rules.
well, as you can see, Larry's had a few and is saying some inappropriate things.
not a good time to talk to the police.
Hey, now.
but I would be happy to set up an interview for tomorrow.
sure. No problem.
just one thing - Who had reason to want your partner dead?
I have no idea.
like I said...
tomorrow.
thanks for your time.
what the hell?
that's weird.
it's late, Grace. What are you still doing here?
just...
had stuff to do.
Hey, take a look at this, would you?
somebody uploaded a file onto the major crime server.
the file was transferred from outside CBI, and that's not possible.
at least it shouldn't be.
that's that "I dare you" thing?
well, let's take the dare.
isn't that the FBI agent?
Darcy, yes.
what is going on?
somebody just uploaded a text file to the same folder as the video.
open it.
Uh...Oakview Inn. Oakview Inn. Quick, let's go. Let's get outta here. Come on.
all right, hold on.
don't move. Federal agent. - CBI. We're friendly. Don't shoot.
sorry about your door.
creepy.
well, looks like you're my knight in shining armor, Patrick.
so... I go to CBI asking about a copycat, and CBI is sent this weird stalking video of me.
Panzer's killer's taken an interest in you.
it's dangerous.
I - I think you should get off the case.
you should give it to someone else.
come on.
this... Weird video makes me wanna go after after that creep even harder.
Yes. I,uh... This is a dangerous situation.
we're not talking about just some peeping tom.
this is a stalker. - Okay, Patrick.
it's a totally different pathology. Psychologically. - Okay, thank you. good night.
I can take care of myself.
I appreciate your help tonight. Thanks.
that video - It was Red John.
Yes.
red John is stalking Darcy.
Yeah. - And you didn't tell her.
are you crazy?
well, if I told her, she - She would've just gone harder at the case.
she's not really the type to stop.
is this about helping Darcy or keeping Red John for yourself?
what? This is not about me. Of course I'm worried about her.
she's cute.
this is gonna be fun that message - That was meant for you.
Yes, that was a message for me.
red John is trying to form a closer relationship with you.
Yeah, well, there's no relationship.
what if Red John took murdering Panzer as some kind of invitation?
you manipulated a serial killer.
there's gonna be consequences.
I didn't have a choice.
I had to stop Panzer.
I will try and get Darcy off the Panzer case before Red John hurts her.
I hope you can.
you had a fight with your partner, Alton Creek?
a disagreement, agent. Not a - I'd like to hear it from him, Ms. Santori.
it was a disagreement.
not a fight.
about money?
go ahead. You can answer.
Yes, we argued over money.
some of his clients were behind in paying their bills, and I told Al to get on them about it.
look, he was my partner for 15 years.
I had nothing but love for the guy.
this is from the security camera outside your building the day before Creek died.
doesn't look much like love.
what were you really arguing about?
I told you.
money.
you know who you should look at, is that hooker he hung out with.
Summer...Autumn, something like that.
she's got a terrible temper.
uh, if there's nothing else, we're gonna get going - Just one more thing, Mr. Dersh.
you lied to us yesterday.
we asked if you knew anyone who wanted your partner dead, and you said no, but that was a lie, wasn't it?
okay, that's enough.
do you know who sent this to your partner?
did you do it?
that is disgusting.
and I certainly didn't do it.
are we done here?
so? - So I asked around.
did Dersh happen to mention Al's little secret?
and by little, I mean big, 'cause he had to know.
what secret?
cost you $1, 000 to find out.
$1, 000?
and dinner at a nice restaurant.
$500 and a pizza.
$600, no mushrooms.
deal.
I hate mushrooms.
what can you get for $127. 68?
you can go crazy at olive garden.
not me. Creek.
van Pelt looked into his business records, and there's something weird.
up until six months ago, every week, he put in for reimbursement by his firm for $127. 68 for expenses.
so he was hiding whatever it is from his partner.
Yeah, but what can you buy for $127. 68?
I don't know.
creek was hiding something else.
our C.I. Found out he had a big gambling habit - Poker, mostly.
illegal? - Very.
San Francisco's got this underground club in the Tenderloin.
creek had lost plenty lately.
that could have been why he and Dersh fought.
Yeah, but a few days later, Creek won 50 grand at Texas hold'em, which turned out to be an even bigger problem.
Why?
he won it from brock Marx.
Bay area crime lord.
marx accused Creek of cheating, threatened to kill him.
felony narcotics, assault, assault with a deadly, and attempted murder.
a mobbed-up guy like this could leave a pig's head outside somebody's door.
go pick him up. - He's in the wind.
parole officer hasn't heard from him in weeks.
crap.
and we think we can find him at this gambling club, but S.F.P.D. is planning on busting the place next week, asked us to go in quiet.
how quiet?
there's Marx.
you okay.
you no.
I wanna play craps. This is the only table.
too bad.
it's okay, baby.
I'll play for the both of us.
I bet I do better than you would have done anyways.
go get a drink. This won't take long.
what is it? What happened?
Darcy's okay.
it's not her.
not directly anyway.
Panzer-the gift that keeps on giving.
do you remember Tom Maier?
he was the father of Panzer's first victim?
sure.
nice man.
he killed himself today.
Oh, well.
try again.
Thanks.
side bet?
like?
you have a bet.
8 the hard way. Winner, 8.
and the shooter passes.
we got a new shooter coming out?
pay up.
right now?
why not?
here?
wait here
so you're pretty much tall, dark, and handsome.
Yeah. - I like that.
police. Brock Marx.
you're under arrest.
for what?
parole violation.
we need to ask you a few questions about a murder.
nice work.
thank you.
What'd you whisper to him?
wouldn't you like to know?
morning, Lisbon.
uh, I need to borrow your office.
too bad. I'm busy.
what costs $127. 68?
creek spent that much every week for months and was hiding it.
until three months ago. Hmm. Anyway, your office?
are you gonna actually help with this case?
well, as soon as I can get Darcy off Panzer's case.
Mr. Jane.
Mrs. Maier, please, thanks for coming to our office. Have a seat.
Lisbon, this is Teri Maier, Tom Maier's wife.
Mrs. Maier, we are so sorry for your loss.
the gardener found him in the backyard.
Tom made sure it wasn't me who found him.
Yeah.
the coroner's office hasn't released the body yet.
I need to bury him.
of course.
I'll check it out immediately.
thank you. - Okay.
I'm so sorry for what happened.
it was the guilt.
it ate him up like a cancer.
every day Tom got smaller and smaller until finally he left.
did he happen to leave a note?
no.
but honestly, I haven't checked.
he felt bad.
so the only thing he could do was hang himself.
he was in so much pain, and all I feel is angry.
we will do everything we can to get the coroner to release the body as soon as possible.
Yeah.
okay. Thank you.
could... Could you...
thank you. Thank you.
could you, uh, help...
uh, I got a lot to do, so have a nice day.
Jane? - yes.
is there something you wanna tell me?
deniability, Lisbon.
deniability - Your best friend.
sent to creek before he was killed.
a warning of what's to come, huh?
make him afraid, paranoid?
this is just your style - Cheap, gruesome, sadistic.
you got a question for me?
or you just wanna chat?
you can keep that.
Lisbon, it's Lane.
let's have lunch in San Francisco.
what do you say?
call me.
Teresa, aw, can't tell you how great it is to see you.
partnered with this one for three years.
Oh, I know.
so how's it goin'?
how's the big old CBI?
Oh, you know, it goes.
FBI's all over us about this, uh, Panzer case.
Oh, feebs.
they were jackbooting about it over here, too.
anyway, what do you say, Bobby?
could you show us your, uh, file on the Panzer case?
uh, yeah, sure.
just have CBI file a request. Form 29.
Oh, of course. Yeah. Yeah.
we were hoping that maybe we could, uh...
expedite the process, you know, talk to you.
we're under the gun with time.
he's okay, Bobby.
did you find any - You know, never mind.
deniability.
guess what we found out?
california bar was investigating your law partner, over his gambling.
that's what your fight was about last week, wasn't it?
Yes.
Alton was out of control.
so you lied to us.
don't answer that.
if Al got disbarred, that was the end of your firm.
he'd become a liability.
and how do lawyers deal with liability?
Oh, don't worry.
it's not a lawyer joke.
they get insurance.
you insured Alton Creek's life for $10 million.
four weeks ago.
I didn't have time to mention it.
it's common for businesses to have a "key man" policy.
al was "key." - Uh, you know what? We're done here.
admit it, Mr. Dersh. Your partner was worth more to you dead, so you killed him.
I said we're done.
fine. Let's go, Mr. Dersh.
agent, seriously, I don't think Larry is capable of this.
don't be naive.
men lie...And kill.
Maier? - Yes.
right in here.
five minutes.
thank you.
Hey, we've had Brock Marx in the box for hours. The guy won't talk.
theory number one - Crime lord. Pig's head.
Yes.
we've got his law partner as well.
insurance motive. You want to question him?
kind of busy right now. Why don't you guys get your suspects together?
and I'll meet you back here in a couple of hours. I promise.
where are you going?
got a find a hobo. Do some errands.
then I gotta run by this flower shop, too.
what?
find a hobo?
flower shop.
Patrick, it's Susan.
Ah, susan. What do I owe the pleasure?
well, I'm calling you back.
Oh, that's right. Yeah.
I just wanted to let you know I went down to the SFPD.
I didn't find anything.
Yes, I know. Why?
well, this Panzer/Red John copycat thing has me very intrigued.
I wanna help out as much as I possibly can.
so, uh...
Susan, you still there?
Yeah.
listen, I need to talk to you about a couple things.
I've gotta go.
Patrick?
Bye.
hello
I was hoping we could talk some more. I wanted to
Jane, they're waiting for you.
hang on one second, agent Lisbon.
I have a few questions if you don't mind
you're more than welcome to wait in the interview room, but this one hasn't done squat on our murder investigation, and he's damn well gonna help.
Yes, I damn well am gonna help.
I'm-I'm sorry. I won't be long.
thanks for rescuing me.
I didn't call you in.
Mr. Jane asked me to come in.
okay, folks. Let's get straight to it.
Patrick Jane.
nice to meet you. Do you prefer eggs for breakfast over cereal?
cereal.
hardened criminal like yourself. That's very interesting.
what's your favorite legal objection?- Well
better to be feared or loved?
you don't have to answer that.
pleasure to finally meet you.
you...
you are a borderline sociopath.
extremely violent.
but not our killer.
you were jealous of the victim's talent, his skills in the courtroom, but he never, uh, bought you flowers.
flowers? No.
Yeah. The flower shop nearest your office, uh, sells a dozen red roses for a very reasonable price of $127. 68.
it was flowers?
Seriously? - Yes.
our romantic victim bought them once a week.
a secret relationship he couldn't disclose - An illicit one.
maybe not that illicit. Now no offense.
but how many men do buy roses for hookers?
I don't hook anymore.
but they do buy them for girlfriends - Girlfriends they can't have under certain rules.
you killed Alton Creek.
uh, that's ridiculous.
I'm an officer of the court.
I see homicidal rage, betrayal. You were lovers. Yes, that's right.
and he dumped you.
hence, the pig's head.
pig for a pig.
ms. Santori, we're gonna have to ask you a few questions
you killed Al? You bitch!
have a nice day.
al was an okay guy. Why the hell did you kill him?
I got this, Summer.
an okay guy?
he said he'd marry me, the bastard!
and then he changed his mind.
he just wasn't ready, wasn't sure of his feelings.
Oh, a divorce attorney who was holding out for true love - What a joke.
the affair ended months ago, long time to hold a grudge.
can you take her to holding, please?
Hey, I waited for him for years.
I put my career on hold to be with him.
I wanted a family, and now it is too late.
he took away my life!
and turns out, all he wanted was a hooker.
I'm not a hooker, bitch.
Susan, did you wanna talk now?
I don't have any time.
field office just got a tip on the Panzer murder.
homeless guy found a bag of stuff in an alley in Fresno.
tip from a hobo?
my people are on it.
there was a bag of clothes with blood spatter on it and a knife.
looks like it could be the knife that killed Panzer.
copycat's sloppy if it's knife.
red John would never have been that careless.
forensics is running the blood now.
Oh, get this.
the alley is in the neighborhood near the Maier home.
no. - Yeah.
the San Joaquin killer. - I know who he is.
he's the father of the first victim. No. I-I-I don't buy that.
maier killed himself yesterday.
we're going to the house now to search it.
okay. Good luck.
I have a confession to make.
when tom killed himself, part of me was angry at him for being weak.
but now I know how strong he was.
now I know.
the FBI found this letter in Molly's room.
it's from Tom.
it's important that you all hear this so you can understand.
my dearest Teri...
if you are reading this, you know what I have done.
I have avenged myself against Jim Panzer.
Jim was the man who killed our Molly.
when I saw him on TV that night, I knew.
I knew he'd killed her.
I can't explain how...
except to say that molly's heart cried out to me, and I knew.
please.
killing the man who murdered our daughter is the best thing I will ever do.
I'm at peace.
I'm just sorry that I'm leaving you alone,
and I hope you forgive me and that in some way, this letter brings you...
some kind of comfort.
love, Tom.
Lord, make me an instrument of your peace.
where there is hatred, let me so love.
and where there is darkness, light.
Amen.
that's very nice of you to give her that letter.
Oh, well, it's the least I could do.
my god, poor woman. - Yeah.
so... The case is closed.
once we got the labs back, it was a slam dunk.
the prints on the knife - Maier's.
the blood was Panzer's. It was denatured, but it was definitely his.
but why Red John?
why... Why would he copycat a dead man?
I don't know.
maybe he felt like he had to emulate a monster to hunt a monster.
so he picked the biggest one he could find.
one thing I can't figure out, though, is why he was stalking me, and why the video?
hunting monsters changes you.
went and killed himself the very next day.
I hope he found peace in the end.
good-bye, Agent Darcy.
did it change you, Patrick?
hunting a monster?
of course.
be well, Susan.
it has changed you, you know.
Darcy's off the case, Lisbon.
she's safe.
and what about you?
how is Red John gonna feel when he finds out you spoiled his fun with Agent Darcy?
lt's okay. Mommy's here, okay?
l need you to be a big boy, okay?
get under the bed. Get under the bed. Right now. Quick. Quick.
please, leave us alone!
Where's Mom? Where's...
go, Michael, go!
No!
Michael, run!
you're going to run down the battery.
like you could get a signal around here anyway.
luckily, people out here remember you can have conversations without those things.
lt's okay, buddy.
be careful not to unbuckle his seatbelt.
l'm not.
we're here. How about that?
no going back now.
we couldn't afford it even if we wanted to.
l know it's a bit run-down, but wait till you see the inside.
Hey, buddy. -Hey, Denise, check out the water pump.
you want to come see your new back yard?
yeah? lt's big.
still works. -Yeah, l'm impressed.
l know you're worried.
but a couple of days and l'll have everything here running like new. l promise.
even that?
all right. Maybe a week.
still think we can do this?
climate's right. The soil reports are great.
listen, l know l couldn't make this work in the city.
but this is something l know.
Jess, come help with these bags.
what do you think of the house?
neat.
help us unload.
lf we want anything to sleep on tonight, we got to get moving.
okay.
neat.
l think she's going to be okay.
well, at least she's talking to us. l guess that's a start.
Yeah.
l love it out here, you know.
Hey. -Hey.
how's it going?
lt's so quiet out here.
Yeah. lt takes some getting used to, huh?
you know, bringing you out here wasn't a punishment, Jessica.
lt's an adjustment for everybody.
and the only way we're going to make this work is if we give it a chance.
l'll take that as a good point, Dad.
you're right. You're always right. "
good night.
get some sleep.
don't give up, honey!
don't worry. l'll get it.
come on.
come on.
come on.
come on. That's right. Come on.
he did it! High-five. High-five.
he did it!
Colby Price. Belton Savings.
Oh, hey. Good to meet you.
so you said your father grew sunflowers, too.
Yeah, over in Turek County.
l grew up not too far from here.
right.
look, l know you're all moved in, but an opportunity came up at the bank that l thought you might be interested in.
this place sat gathering dust for years until you came along and bought it, and now, as it happens, another party's expressed interest in the farm.
the good news is, they're willing to pay what you paid and put another 15o% on top of that.
we just got here.
and frankly, my family's looking for a little stability right now.
well, this will give you the details.
give me a call if you want to discuss it.
Thanks, l will.
Hey, Benny.
l'm coming.
you ready?
Oh, great.
Hey, sport.
l thought you were asleep.
how'd you get out of bed, sport?
l thought you were...
come on. Let's get you to bed.
okay.
all right, Ben. Now you try to get some sleep now, okay?
lay down. Go to sleep. Good boy.
daddy loves you.
what?
what are you doing?
going to town. -l don't think so, Jess.
give me the keys.
l just had them, like, two seconds ago.
Thanks, Jess. You ready to go?
what's up with that?
lt was me, not her.
l thought she was taking the car.
don't beat yourself up over it.
by the way, your son managed to climb out of his crib last night.
that's new.
Yeah.
so are the things l'm gonna do to you when l come in from the fields tonight.
new things, huh? -Oh, yeah.
l've been reading the farmer-sutra.
see you.
there you go. You have a good day now. -Thanks, Ed.
well, you're the new folks in town, right?
Yeah, Roy Solomon.
so what do you plant? -Sunflowers.
all right. Let me help you get started.
Hey, mind if l go look around?
okay.
Hey, don't go too far.
Hey, buddy.
Hey, what're you looking at?
you didn't get to finish your cereal.
and Daddy said you got out of the crib last night all by yourself.
did you do that all by yourself?
nice!
pass it up.
got it.
you're all over him.
get up! Get up! -Take it!
come on, Bobby. What was that? -Come on.
little help?
Thanks.
lt's all in the wrists. -Right.
l'm Bobby.
Jess.
welcome to North Dakota, Jess. You're from Chicago, right?
Yeah. How'd you know that?
small town. Everybody knows everything. You might want to remember that.
so what do you guys do for fun out here?
you're looking at it.
sweet.
half now and half at harvest. That's the best l can do.
l appreciate it.
and if you're looking for labor, it's gotten cheap with all the unemployment.
l can't afford much now, but l'll keep it in mind. Thanks, Ed.
you're kicking my ass.
Yeah, it's all in the wrists.
come on, you played in Chicago, right?
well, l used to. l played in junior high.
yeah? What happened?
l don't know. l guess l just got into other things.
well, the girls' team here is for shit.
Yeah, boys' is too, if you're on it.
nice one, bro.
Hey, you know, if you ever get bored of doing nothing out at the farm, l could always swing by and pick you up, and we could go do nothing someplace else.
Yeah, maybe.
Hey, l got to go.
l'll see you around. -Yeah.
nice to meet you.
Hey, who was that kid?
just some guy.
from around here?
no. He commutes to shoot hoops.
you get his number?
dad.
lf you want to go back, if you're too embarrassed, -l'll get his number for you. -Dad.
you know, l think you and your mom would have a lot to talk about if you give it a try.
we're all in this together, Jess.
so l'll go see if Mom needs anything.
okay. Sure.
how was town?
small.
Hey, Jess, l'm really sorry about earlier.
lt's okay.
need me to help you with anything?
l'd love it if you could carry down some of those boxes in the hallway.
sure. Where do you want them?
just put them in the cellar.
Thanks.
Oh, God. You got to stop that.
sorry if l surprised you.
what do you want?
l wondered if you'd had a chance to look at that purchase offer yet.
we're gonna make a go of it.
we're staying.
now, if you don't mind, l've got work to do.
of course.
always lots of work to do around a farm.
bye now.
damn it!
get out of here!
shit.
Oh, my God.
about the only thing that keeps them away.
they always like that?
no. Hell, they just want your seeds.
Roy Solomon. -John Burwell.
good to meet you. Lucky you came by when you did.
you live around here? -No, l was just heading into town.
got to go where the work is.
what do you do?
a little bit of everything. Why, you...
you need some help around here?
what was that noise? What's going on?
everything's all right.
this is John Burwell, part-time crow exterminator.
the crows were going nuts out here. lf John hadn't come along when he did, l might have gotten pecked to death.
well, it's a good thing he did then.
l could sure use somebody to help me in the fields, but l really can't pay you till harvest.
we could provide meals and put you up in the workers' quarters till then.
sunflowers, huh?
all you can eat.
that sounds good to me.
well, l was making some lunch. Would you like to join us?
sure. Sounds good. -Okay.
do you mind keeping that outside?
sorry.
got any family out here, John?
no, ma'am. Just me.
think it's going to be a good harvest?
well, it's been a while since that land's been planted, so, yeah.
that's what l like to hear.
Cheers.
Hey, Jess. Do you mind helping me with these?
Yeah.
Thanks.
you want this?
he won't stop.
but it must mean he likes you.
what are you looking for?
nothing.
what's wrong?
Oh, my God!
are you okay?
what happened? -lt's no big deal.
l cut my hand on the tractor.
Oh, honey, you're gonna need stitches.
no, l just need a bandage.
no, we got to get you to the hospital.
well, l can take him.
not with a suspended license, you can't.
all right. l'm going to get Ben's bag. Jess, you get in the car.
Ben can stay here with Jess.
Roy, l don't think it's a good idea.
just grab the keys and let's go. Jess and Ben will be fine.
John's right outside if they need anything.
holy shit.
your dad gonna be all right?
Yeah. He probably just needs some stitches.
Hey, what you got there? Farmer?
you gonna be a farmer when you grow up, like your daddy, huh?
let me know if you need anything, okay? -Yeah, thanks.
what's up with the crows?
all right, Ben. Tonight we have filet mignon, veal parmesan, baked Alaska, chicken cacciatore, and mac and cheese.
stay here, Ben, okay?
Hey.
ls that you?
Hey, who is...
91 1. What's your emergency?
l think there's something in my house!
I need you to get everybody out of the house as quickly as possible.
we'll send a car immediately. Ma'am' are you alone?
no, l'm with... l'm with...
Ben, what are you...
let me go!
what's wrong?
help us! Take him. Take him.
what's the matter?
what is it? Jess. What's the matter?
Oh, Roy, l hope they're okay.
what happened? -Everything's all right, ma'am.
Oh, God.
l already checked all the rooms. There's nobody here.
but she described a lot of damage.
as of now, we're going to classify this as a false alarm, not a deliberate hoax.
thank you.
what did John say?
well, he said it was easy to understand someone getting scared their first night alone out here.
but that he didn't see anything unusual in the house.
mom, please believe me. l'm not making this up. l'm telling the truth.
Jess, please.
just stop.
dad...
dad, l'm really scared. Can we just go home?
Jessica, this is home.
you need to get used to that.
but l thought we agreed that you were going to try.
what happened to that?
Hi. Shut the door.
maybe we shouldn't have left Ben alone with her.
did you see her face? She seemed so scared.
l'm really worried about her.
she's just having a hard time adjusting, that's all.
being out here will be great for her.
l don't know.
maybe we're in over our heads here, Roy. -We'll get through this.
just give her some time. She'll be fine.
you saw it too, didn't you?
come on. l know you did. You had to have.
just tell me.
l wish you could just tell them what you saw.
come on, Ben. When are you going to start talking?
l promise l'll never let anything happen to you.
l promise.
you heard that, too, didn't you?
can you see them?
where are they, Ben?
son of a bitch!
Hey, you didn't hear that.
dad said you needed this. -Yeah, thanks.
why did you tell my parents you didn't see anything last night?
well, because l didn't.
l mean, look, l know you were scared.
and l know that people, even your parents, sometimes, -they don't know how to listen. -Especially my parents.
they got pressures that you can't even begin to understand.
you sure you saw something up there?
l saw it. lt was real.
maybe you've just got a lot on your mind.
Hey, Jess.
Hey. Thanks for coming. -Yeah.
you don't look so good. What's up?
did you know the family that used to live in my house?
not really. lt was the Rollins that lived there.
what happened to them?
they just up and left about five, six years ago.
there were some bad harvests. Lot of people didn't make it.
hey...
did you ever hear of anything about my house being, like, haunted?
seriously.
just, like, stupid stories. lt's been abandoned for a long time. So...
what kind of stories? -Nothing really.
when we were kids, we used to dare each other to go down into the cellar.
Why? Did you ever see anything?
no. Not me.
l never went down there.
what's happening to me?
are you okay?
l saw something again today.
lt's a girl. She was in the cellar. Something...
something happened to her.
she was trying to get away from something.
get away from what? -l don't know.
but she was...
she looked just scared to death.
have you told your folks about this?
you know my parents already think l'm nuts.
do you think it's crazy?
people's spirits hanging around after they're dead?
no.
there's something about the land out here.
lt gets ahold of people. lt doesn't want to let them go.
what about you? Don't you get lonely out here?
don't you miss having a family of your own?
Nah, you guys keep me plenty busy.
thank you. For listening.
anytime.
almost ready. -Yes! That's what l'm talking about.
l really like being here, Roy.
you guys make me feel like family. l'm grateful.
lucky to have you, John.
let's see how good the harvest is, and maybe l can afford to keep you on.
don't worry about me. You just take care of your family.
help me.
Hello?
what do you want from me?
Hey.
you okay?
can you hear me?
what's wrong?
ls she okay?
the lacerations are superficial. So she'll be just fine.
Oh, thank God.
ls there any reason...
has there been any trouble in the family recently that would make her want to hurt or draw attention to herself?
we just moved here from Chicago.
and back there,
Jess got into some trouble.
she's kind of struggled a bit.
we've been dealing with a lot of emotional issues.
Jessica? Your mom's here.
Hey.
dad, we need to leave the house now, before anything else happens.
dad.
dad, l'm really scared.
have you forgotten how hard it was the last couple of years?
me out of work, Ben's hospital bills.
we went through every dime your mother and l managed to save.
twenty years. Twenty years of savings gone in two years.
we have everything riding on this harvest, Jess. Everything.
we're only a couple of days away. Please.
mom, these things attacked me. -Enough!
God. The doctor said your cuts look self-inflicted.
that's what he said. That you did this!
you actually think that l would do this to myself?
why won't you believe me?
how can we, Jess?
tell me!
l mean, we thought you put this all behind you.
why do you keep blaming everything on me?
you never listen to me.
and what? We're supposed to pretend like we're some big happy family again?
l can't do that.
let her go.
maybe coming here was a mistake.
don't second-guess yourself, Roy.
why not? Everybody else around here does.
don't attack me over this.
l should have sold.
damn it. -What?
right after we got here, there was another offer on the place.
we would have made our money back, plus another 15o%.
and you didn't even mention this to me?
how could l? You would have taken the offer on the spot.
so you make this decision without even telling me?
l held this family together for two years while you were looking for a job.
and then l come all the way out here when you decided this was the answer.
and now we had another option and you didn't even tell me about it?
you held this family together?
ls that why you and Jess can't even be in the same room for more than five minutes?
no wonder the girl's a mess.
damn, Denise. Denise, l'm sorry.
damn it.
damn.
everything okay, Roy?
no matter what l do, l can't keep this family together.
Hey. You all right?
do you want a ride?
so where are we going?
feed store.
Why?
Bobby, l'm gonna tell you something.
and l need you to believe me, because nobody else does.
okay.
l don't think the Rollins just up and left.
what are you talking about, Jess?
l think something really terrible happened to them.
l think they're dead. l've seen them.
you've seen ghosts?
have you talked to your parents? -l've tried but they won't listen to me.
Why?
back in Chicago, l messed up.
like, six months ago, my mom was picking up my dad from the airport.
and his flight was late, so she called to see if l could pick up my little brother from the babysitter's house.
and l should have told her that l'd been drinking with my friends but...
l mean, it wasn't like l was wasted or anything, and l thought l was okay to drive.
but we got in a wreck, and Ben had to go to the hospital.
and he hasn't talked since then.
l mean, they just haven't let it go yet.
everybody makes mistakes, Jess.
Yeah.
your sister's going to be okay.
right, Benny?
say, " Right, Mama. "
what are you pointing at, Ben?
what do you see?
what does it look like?
what the hell?
okay, honey. Lie down for your nap, sweetie.
you okay? All right.
the woman in this watch, l remember seeing her here.
there!
that's her.
Oh, my God.
what is it? -l got to get home.
Ben, honey. We got to get out of here.
honey, come on.
mama will be right there. Mama will be right there.
all right. Stay right there. All right, okay.
mama will be right there. You stay right there.
Oh, my God, John.
where are you going?
where are you going, Mary?
what?
what is this?
are you leaving me?
l don't... -Shut up!
no, don't...
l've been working my ass off every day.
lt's never good enough for you, is it? -Oh, God.
did you really think that l could ever let you leave me?
open this door! Open this door, Mary!
mom?
dad?
mom?
mom?
go!
Bobby, wait!
what? -My brother.
he's not here. Let's go. -Bobby, watch out!
open the door!
mom?
mom.
Oh, Jess.
l know what you were seeing.
l've seen it, too. l'm so sorry l didn't trust you.
mom, l've got to find a way out of here.
okay? -Okay.
Mary. Do you think l would let you walk out on this family?
open the door, Lindsay.
open the door!
you're not leaving me.
be quiet, sweetheart. Be quiet.
where are they, Bobby? Where are they?
dad? -Jess.
dad!
you've been a bad girl, Lindsay.
No! Leave her alone!
come here!
why are you always trying to run away from me, Lindsay?
what's the matter with you?
don't you like your family?
my family is going to stick together!
we're not your family!
mom?
dad!
l got you.
hold on!
Hey, honey, it's me.
lt's gonna be all right.
Mrs. Solomon, l have just a few more questions.
you're gonna be okay.
excuse us, please.
let's get him in.
maybe now they can rest, Ben.
Hey. -Hey.
you thirsty? -Oh, yeah. Thanks.
so, how's it going?
getting there.
what's up there, dude? What's in the sky?
that. Birdie. -What's that?
ls that a cloud? -Crow. That's a crow.
how about that?
fairy tales can come true
it can happen to you
if you're young at heart
for it's hard, you will find
to be narrow of mind
if you're young
Henry?
at heart
Henry.
you can go to extremes...
what?
don't you hear the phone ringing?
with impossible dreams
no.
you can laugh when your dreams
fall apart at the seams
hello.
Yes, is this Helen Sawyer?
and if you should survive
are you sure it's him?
I'm very sorry.
he's at the hospital...
out of being ali--
we're here to see Gabriel Sawyer.
she can take you there.
this way.
he's right here.
Oh, God.
this brain image shows us a midline tumor, extending on both sides into the frontal lobes.
it also reaches backward to the temporal lobes and downward to the forebrain here.
so the tumor is in this area here?
no, Mr. Sawyer, that is the tumor.
it appears to be benign, but it went unchecked for so long, we won't be able to tell what kind of permanent damage has been done until after we operate.
how are you doing this morning?
I'm gonna ask you some questions, and I want you to tell me the answers, okay?
okey-dokey.
what's your name?
Gabriel.
okay, good.
what year were you born, Gabriel?
1951
fine.
and what year is it now?
all right, now, Gabriel, can you count from 1 to 10 out loud for me?
count me out.
I'll start you.
buckle my shoe.
he seemed to be fooling around with you.
that's a good sign, isn't it?
that's not really fooling around.
part of Gabriel's brain which controls inhibition has been destroyed, so he reacts incontinently to things around him.
it's like it's not even him.
when was the last time you saw him?
he, uh--he left home...
several years ago.
nearly 20.
did drugs cause this?
no, I don't think so.
from the way he looks, he was on the streets for some time.
Oh, God.
and unfortunately, though slow-growing, the tumor also destroyed structures of the medial side of both the temporal lobes, in particular what is called the hippocampus, and these are the areas of the brain we use to form new memories, like what I'm telling you now, new information.
Mr, and Mrs. Sawyer, even if Gabriel makes a full recovery, his memory has been damaged.
Gabriel's long-term memory stops at a certain point, and even if he regains some cognitive function, like perception of his surroundings, it's likely that it will be inconsistent and intermittent.
Henry Sawyer.
can it wait till tomorrow?
I'm on my way to the hospital.
okay, be right there.
how's Gabe?
Oh, you know, hard to tell.
we're moving him to a permanent-care place.
it's, uh, closer to home.
thanks for asking.
Henry, I can only imagine what you're going through.
actually, I can't even.
I don't know how you could possibly concentrate on anything.
Oh, it helps me to work, Mike, to be here.
Yeah. I get that.
but let's be candid, Henry.
at the moment, when you're here, you're not really here, and we're dealing with harsh realities on our end.
you're a fine mechanical engineer, Henry, but we're getting into the still video market.
we need computer coding skills, ASICs chip programming, you need Fortran, things like that.
are you firing me?
Henry, you've got a year and half of sick days, and you've got your full pension.
do yourself a favor.
take the time.
be with your family.
there were bells on the hill
but I never heard them ringing
no, I never heard them at all...
okay, ready for inspection?
okay.
pencils? - Check.
notebook? - Check.
Robin Hood lunchbox?
Roger that.
you know what song this is?
till There was You.
Mm-hmm. Year? - 1950.
composer?
Meredith Wilson.
the first time I heard this song was June 23, 1950.
it was the opening night of the Roseland Dance Hall.
two days before Uncle Gabriel went to fight in the war.
that's right.
and Uncle Gabriel took Ruth McDonald, and I had to go with Ruth's sister, Gladys.
the fat one.
Yeah, the big old, super-duper vat of velveeta cheese fat one.
Henry.
Yeah, that one.
and this song was the very last song the orchestra played that night, just as I first set my eyes on your...
mom. - Mom.
it was the first song.
no. It was the last song.
last time, it was the first song.
Gabe, it's time.
I'd like to buy the world a Coke
and keep it company
it's the real thing...
Hey, Gabriel. What's happening?
in perfect harmony...
Gabriel.
it's Bernie from down the hall.
Bernie the Hernie.
it's the real thing
you must be very hungry, Gabriel.
I'm Gabriel. You're hungry.
I am.
Gabe, open your mouth.
close your eyes. Go to sleep.
Gabriel, open your mouth.
open your mouth. Stick out your tongue.
why don't we let Gabriel try to eat by himself?
I'm going outside.
come on, Gabe. You have to eat.
would you like a sip of Coke?
it's the real thing.
now you can play like your Uncle Gabe.
he's gettin' it.
maybe trumpet's not the right instrument.
he's getting it.
is this good?
it's fine.
we should get going soon.
you go on ahead.
what do you mean?
I'll go tomorrow.
he doesn't know the difference.
take your pills.
you're not going to bed anytime soon, are you?
I'll be right back.
Hey, can you hand me my radio?
Oh, sure.
I bet you like what my son likes.
there we go.
the edge of the night...
there we go, sweetie.
this one?
I gave him his meds at
okay, who knows what song that was?
I don't know what happened, but I don't see any significant change in his functioning this morning.
we'll certainly keep observing.
but I have noticed a difference in him.
what do you mean?
I--I think Gabriel remembered part of a television commercial.
we were eating lunch, and I asked him if he'd like a sip of Coke, and he said, "It's the thing
it's the real thing.
Yeah.
what is?
no, it's the commercial. I think the line is "It's the real thing.
Yeah. That commercial was on the TV in the rec room.
well it's possible to read into
Gabriel's behavior in any number of ways.
but he remembered a commercial.
Gabriel was watching TV.
Helen, the fact is the tumor has destroyed some of Gabriel's cognitive functions and the parts of the brain that operate them.
but he made a connection.
he may make random or repetitive connections, but they won't be consistent or indicate a recovery of memory.
I'm sorry.
come on, Helen. Let's go home.
thank you, doctor.
this is Cap Carsen throwing you back to 1968 and the Tulips, their top 10 hit, It's about Summer.
all the kids, they want today
all they ever think about's about summer
please leave it on.
it's about summer
all the kids, they want today
all they ever think about is about summer
it's about summer
all the kids, they want today
all their problems to go away
it's about summer
it's about-- - One second!
you want to spray something in here?
Hey, Dad.
Gabriel, your mother's just about ready with dinner.
far out. I'm starving.
Ah, man, that's great. I'm so hungry.
Yeah.
uh, unfortunately, there's not enough for everyone tonight.
th-that's okay. We were
Mr. Sawyer, we were just saying that we were hungry for our own dinners that our own Mrs. Sawyers were gonna cook for us.
it'll just be a second, Dad.
we'll be finished in a sec. I'll be upstairs.
about summer
it's about summer
all the neighborhood cats and dogs...
hello.
Yes.
get along in the summer...
are you sure there's not a mistake?
Henry, are we okay?
what?
they just called from the hospital and said our bill hadn't been paid.
is everything all right?
everything's fine.
I'll get around to it.
I'm sleeping.
Helen. How are you?
fine, and you?
doing well. How's Gabriel?
he's doing better.
great.
that's great. And, uh, Henry?
he's fine. You know, he was much happier when he was working.
we wish he could still be here.
I'm offering you the next-best thing.
what's that?
me.
my family needs the extra income.
I could start immediately, and I'd make a great assistant or secretary.
Helen, you've never worked before, have you?
Mike, my husband was an engineer here for more than 30 years.
he missed two days of work in all of that time.
his mother died on one of those days, and our son was born on the other.
Yes, I stayed home to take care of our family, like your mother probably did for you, but I went to college, and I have a degree.
I could have done anything.
I'm capable of doing something here.
is this good?
I don't know. Check the date.
you're wearing that to the hospital?
no. Actually, I'm wearing this to work.
what work?
Mike Tappin gave me a job.
I'll be assisting in the accounting office.
you just took a job?
without telling me?
Henry, we have a lot of bills, and I'm perfectly capable of working.
what about Gabriel?
he needs you.
luckily he has two parents.
he needs them both.
I gotta go.
please bring Gabriel his sweater.
what, is he going out?
he gets cold sometimes. He should have it.
take your pills.
Oh, Mr. Sawyer.
Gabriel, your father's here.
time for cheer.
what's the matter, Gabriel?
you lose something?
what's wrong with him?
Ah, he's fine.
he's just used to seeing his mother.
but he's happy to see you.
aren't you, Gabriel?
Gabriel, I'm here because Mom is working now.
he'll get used to it.
Gabriel, this can help you remember the date.
and this...
that Dad comes every day at 10 A. M.
understand?
excuse me. Where's the Social Sciences building?
it's just past there to your right.
thank you.
are you Dr. Daly?
I didn't mean to interrupt.
I'm here because I read an article about your work.
Oh, you're the one who read it.
I was hoping to talk to you about my son.
Thanks.
do you know who vissarion Shebalin was?
Yeah, the Russian composer.
Yes.
Wow. You really know your classical music, Mr. Sawyer.
well, you just said pretty much everything I know about him.
Oh. Well, I only know him because he suffered two strokes in the fifties that left him unable to speak or understand the meaning of words, but he was still able to teach and compose music.
it's already well documented that music elicits measurable responses in the brain's activities, so the Marseillaise may well have had some effect on your son, and if that's so, we may be able to use music as a tool to
to help him function better, to reawaken parts of his memory that may have been damaged.
now, I don't want to offer false hope.
it's better than what we have now.
Hi.
I'm Dianne Daly.
Gabriel. - Gabriel.
that's a-- that's a nice name.
I'm a nice guy.
I bet you are.
it's good to meet you.
Gabriel, I'm--I'm here because I'm a
I'm a music therapist.
why don't you come sit down?
do you like music?
I'm the music man.
good. Good.
all right, let's-- let's play something.
Gabriel...
what's wrong?
he's slipping away.
let's try that again.
okay. Okay.
it's all right.
the music definitely had some effect.
Yeah.
I was hoping for something a little more like my son.
humans are incredibly complex beings.
this is not an exact science.
we're really making science.
I'm not convinced yet that he's even aware of his state.
let's be patient.
Gabriel, I'm Dianne Daly.
I'm a music therapist, and your father and I are gonna play you some music.
fairy tales can come true
it can happen to you
if you're young at heart
what song is this, Gabriel?
bing Crosby, Young at Heart, 1954.
do you remember when I first heard this song?
you can go to extremes
with impossible dreams
you can laugh when your dreams
fall apart at the seams
and life gets more exciting
with each passing day...
Oh, never against the grooves, partner.
always with the grooves.
good.
thank you.
does Uncle Gabe hear this in heaven?
I hope so.
is that why we're playing it?
well, it is Uncle Gabe's birthday, so that's part of the reason.
what's the other part?
well, this was Uncle Gabe's favorite song, so when we play it, we remember him...
like he was here with us playing his trumpet right along with Count Basie.
does Count Basie bite people?
why would he bite people?
like Count Dracula.
no. No, not all counts are vampires.
a count is like royalty, someone important, you know?
count Basie is a count because he's an important musician.
like Duke Ellington is the duke of the bandleaders,
count Basie is the count of the piano.
all right, we're in the middle of a midnight snack with the Beatles here on WDED, 'cause, you know, "All You Need is Love.
holy shit.
Gabriel, is this the song?
love, love, love...
I love the Beatles.
magical Mystery Tour!
all You Need is Love.
and Sgt. Pepper's, too.
that's an amazing album.
Oh, A Day in the Life, that orchestral explosion at the end.
Aw, what a trip, man.
nothing you can sing that can't be sung...
I love them.
the Stones, too.
you know, a-and Cream.
I actually-- I saw them play once.
Jack Bruce,
ginger Baker-- I mean, amazing drummer.
Eric Clapton on guitar.
it doesn't come much better than that.
Ah, and, you know, no one spaces me out like the Dead.
there's no one like them.
pigpen.
I love him.
Gabriel...
do you know why you're here at Woodhaven?
because I'm not that intelligent.
I think you're very intelligent.
can you tell me, where you were born?
white Plains, New York.
good.
good. And what year were you born?
1951
good. So
so how old are you now?
you know, I don't think about how old I am or what year it is.
yeah?
well, that's kind of an important question.
that's the thing.
can you tell me who the president is?
Lyndon-- the one who was shot.
Ronald...
McDonald.
what? Wrong clown?
Yeah.
okay.
let's try something else.
must have it.
will this work?
uncle John's Band?
it's a good song.
Ah, God. No one spaces me out like the Dead does.
what a group.
you know, I--I almost saw them once.
Oh? What happened?
Oh...
we didn't make it.
want to tell me about it?
well, my dad didn't want us to go.
he wanted me to go to college night.
sorry.
dinner is at 7: 00.
Yeah, every night since the birth of Christ.
let's just enjoy our dinner.
I said I was sorry. I'm sorry.
it's far out, Mom.
Thanks.
something wrong with the meat?
well, I mean, aside from the fact that it was once an innocent, breathing, minding-his-own-business creature of Mother Nature herded into a cramped slaughterhouse, so we could adorn our stroganoff, no, there's nothing wrong with the meat.
Lord, I can't wait until you put that mind to something useful in college.
do you remember college?
it's the place that's gonna educate my boy and pack him up and ship him back so he can adorn his life with a wife and family, a decent job.
Yeah, I know what college is, Dad.
I'm just not sure it's my bag.
what is your bag, Gabriel?
I want to go to the village and play music.
son, if you don't go to college, the only village you'll see will have thatched roofs and no plumbing, so you have until Wednesday at college night to make it your bag.
I can't go.
the Dead is playing at Stonybrook that night.
this is not a negotiation.
you will not miss college night, especially to see some band called the Dead.
it's the Grateful Dead, Dad.
it's the Grateful Dead.
Oh. Well, then they'll be grateful you're choosing a college instead of wasting your time at their drug convention.
the music department offers courses which range from music theory and history to performance classes.
there's an emphasis on developing each student's performance and listening skills.
Gabriel?
do you have any questions?
uh, yeah.
um, where's the Princeton booth?
the other side, next to Brown.
groovy.
dad, I'm gonna go explore.
sugar magnolia...
come on! Get in!
Gabe, move! Move it!
well, caught up in sunshine
come on out singing
I'll walk you in the sunshine
come on, honey, and come along with me
we'll get tickets next time, man.
don't worry about my brother.
he can handle anything.
I'm cool, man.
112's not a bad number.
Nam don't worry me.
all right?
Oh, shit.
we didn't even get in to the concert.
you won't see her again, not till you straighten yourself out.
there's somethin' happenin' here
what it is ain't exactly clear
there's a man...- Turn that down.
with a gun over there
need to get to bed.
tellin' me --
I'm not tired.
you look tired.
your mother said, uh, your band has a gig on Saturday.
Yeah.
I thought we might come.
to take his children home...
Gabriel!
lunch before love.
you think she's a fox, huh?
what?
the cafeteria girl, you like her?
can I help you?
Hi. I'm Gabriel.
Hi, Gabriel. I'm Celia.
Oh, Celia, you're breakin' my heart...
you're shakin' my confidence daily.
that's Ce-cilia.
it's all the sa-same to me.
do you want your chicken without the skin?
Yeah, sure, Celia, slip me some skin.
Oh, so you want the skin?
sure. - Okay.
there you go.
you know how you hear a song, and you fall in love with it, and it may be years before you hear it again, but when you do, it instantly places you back in that moment when you first fell in love with it, as if no time had passed?
Yes. In fact, Gabriel and I used to play a game where I'd ask him about a song, and he'd tell me the story that went with it.
that's why I brought that music in.
that's the music we used to listen to.
well, it's, uh--it's not the music he loved, or at least it's not the music that resonates with him.
I don't think the piece on the radio that night was the Marseillaise.
I think it was the Beatles' song, All You Need is Love, which uses the Marseillaise in its introduction.
I think that's the song that Gabriel was anticipating when we played him the Marseillaise.
what happened when you played him that Beatles song?
Oh, Helen, if you could have seen him.
he was totally connected.
he was as you've described him, Henry.
he was normal.
and it wasn't just the Beatles.
I actually was able to use pieces of music from that period to more specifically pinpoint the extent of his amnesia.
he remembers songs vividly from 1964 to 1970.
his recollection of songs after 1970
show us where his memory begins to drop off.
he remembers all the founding members of the Grateful Dead from 1966, but he doesn't know that Pigpen and Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin are all dead.
I didn't know they were ever alive, and I'm no worse for wear.
Yes, but for him, these musicians are all hugely important.
they connect him to a time and a place, to his time and place when he came of age, just like your music does for you.
my music was his music.
he used to listen to that music as a kid.
it never upset him.
it doesn't make sense to me. He loved my music, too.
Hi, Gabriel.
it's Dianne.
dianne from Cheyenne.
actually, Gabriel, I'm not from Cheyenne.
I'm Dianne Daly from Dedham, Massachusetts.
that's where I was born.
dianne Daly, live from Dedham.
that's good.
we'll have to try and remember that.
I love the Dead.
uncle John's Band.
it's one of my favorite songs.
you know, I almost got to see them play once.
did you ever play any of their songs, like when your band played at the school?
no.
I mean, we would have, but I never got to it.
my dad was coming.
I wanted to play Kansas City for him.
it was his brother's favorite song.
all the kids, they want today
all they ever think about
it's about summer
it's about summer
it's about summer
it's about summer
it's about summer
it's about summer
we love you, Gabe!
let's hear it for the Black Sheep.
black Sheep!
black Sheep!
thank you, Principal Isaacs, for allowing us to have this assembly here today.
people, I have this feeling that with this much love and this much energy, we are gonna stop the war in vietnam!
Yeah. Yeah!
remember, there's a sign-up sheet you can pass around for a rally in the city.
please sign up.
we need your help.
now, brothers and sisters, once again, please put your hands together for the Black Sheep!
I'm going to Kansas City
Kansas City, here I come
going to Kansas City
Kansas City, here I come
they've got some pretty little girls
Hey!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Gabe!
Gabe, put it down!
put it out!
what did you do to my room?
you spit on me.
you spit on me today.
today was not about you.
they're not your friends who are going off and dying in some stupid war.
well, that's brilliant.
so you burn the very thing that gives you the right to demonstrate that.
we burned the flag that's sending people like me over there.
what do you know about fighting in a war?
I fought to defend that flag.
your Uncle Gabriel, your namesake, died defending that flag.
he was people like you.
he believed he was fighting for something important.
what do you believe in? - I don't see anything to believe in.
well if you don't have any respect for yourself, at least show some for him.
you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
you're the only thing I'm ashamed of!
Gabriel.
is that right?
okay.
you want to burn something?
burn this. - Dad.
please, stop this.
burn it. No, no, no.
Gabriel wants to burn a flag.
I've got one right here I think he should burn.
I'm getting out of here.
I want you to burn this!
enough, Henry. - Burn it!
go to hell!
I'm splitting.
then don't bother coming back.
fine!
come with me or go alone
he's come to take his children home
and that's when you went to Manhattan?
Yeah. To the village. Yeah.
I can't go with you now.
sure you can.
look, you can.
this is our dream.
Gabe, you're graduating in a few months.
that's nothing. We'll go then.
I don't need a bullshit diploma.
I don't need it.
it's now. Now is the time.
This--there's nothing for us here.
it's all there, and we're gonna miss it.
Gabe, you're just upset, and you just need to think about this, Gabe.
I mean, you really need to think about it.
come.
please.
please.
I can't go.
I know.
I know.
come hear Uncle John's band...
that must have been hard, Gabe.
when did this happen?
I don't know. Couple years ago.
it doesn't matter, and I'm not going back.
...playing to the tide
come on along or go alone
he's come to take--
that's not what happened.
that night, that's not what happened.
it's not important.
that's exactly what happened.
Gabriel's memory is like it's been preserved in a jar.
we have intervening memories, and each new memory colors our perceptions of our old memories.
Gabriel can't do that.
he can't remember that he's seen you almost every day in the last few months.
he can't even remember the conversation that we just had.
I'll tell you about something I remember.
I remember a little boy who was gonna have everything...
and I remember how that music...
my son was poisoned by the garbage you're feeding him, and there aren't enough intervening memories in the world to help me forget that.
you're using music to bring him back to a time when he fell apart.
I don't want to go back to that time.
let's find some music that can bring him back to a time when things were right.
Henry, it doesn't work that way.
what we need to do now is to find the music that he loved, and
no, what we need to do now is what I say we need to do now.
this is my son.
he's my son, too.
Yes.
of course.
our son.
and speaking for both of us, thank you very much for your help.
we won't be needing you anymore.
I apologize for my husband.
I think you and Gabriel have done great work...
and I want you to keep going.
thank you.
what are you doing?
I'm sleeping in Gabriel's room.
I can't share a bed with you anymore, not after today.
why are you angry with me?
I'm not angry with you. I'm angry with me.
Gabriel is not the only one who remembers it that way.
I remember that night in exactly the same way, because every day, I replay it in my head, and I look for a place that I could've said something that would have changed all this.
I know
I know there's something I could've said to make him stay.
then he wouldn't have left for all those years, and we wouldn't have found him like that, and he wouldn't be sick.
what does it matter what stupid music brings back our son?
his music. Your music. Who cares?
you're so pigheaded.
where do you think Gabriel learned to be so moved by his music?
is that some big mystery?
you're always going on about what your music reminds you of, as if you're the only one that has memories worth recalling.
you know what those songs remind me of?
the man who introduced me to them.
what happened to him?
I once held her in my arms
she said she will
always stay
but I was cruel
I treated her like a fool
I threw it all away
once I had mountains
in the palm of my hand
and rivers that ran though...
whoa.
these are old.
Yeah.
I'll bet I could go 2 1/2 for these, if they're in good shape.
they're mint.
all right, just trade me these for everything you got after 1958 that's loud
could you be more specific?
I like to dream
Yes, yes --
I'm just mad about saffron
Oh, saffron's mad about me --
I went down to the crossroads
fell down on my knees --
getting to the point
where I'm no fun anymore --
because I used to love her
but it's all over now --
goin' down the road
feelin' bad
goin' down the road
feelin' bad
Hey, hey, hey
don't wanna be treated this way
I brought some music for us to listen to.
they're selling postcards of the hanging
they're painting the passports brown...
do you know what song this is?
I have no idea.
desolation Row.
great song and amazing lyrics.
they're selling postcards of the hanging.
do you know when I first heard this song?
no, Gabriel. Tell me.
first time I heard this song,
it was --I don't know -- maybe a couple summers ago.
I had just bought Highway 61.
you and Mom were downstairs, and, you know, she had made stuffed cabbage.
the smell was hanging around the house.
and you remember? You
you put the milk in the freezer, and she was mad at you for that, and you were mad at me 'cause I was late for dinner, but I had just gotten this album.
I was out of my mind to listen to it.
man, it spoke to me.
I mean, all-- all the craziness, you know?
all--all the possibilities.
it's like when I put my hands on the neck of a guitar.
you can see things that you can't normally see.
and the only sound that's left
that's great, Gabe.
after the ambulances go
is Cinderella sweeping up on
desolation Row. Desolation row...
what is that?
Dylan was writing about this lynching that happened after a circus.
and "They're selling postcards of the hanging.
the Tet offensive was on Cronkite.
I was listening to it.
and the Times was-- was running that photo of the vietnamese officer who was executing a prisoner.
it's--it's psychotic.
it's--it's psychedelic.
it's insane, you know?
I mean, this--this is a circus.
and the hunchback of Notre Dame
everybody is making love
or else expecting rain
and the Good Samaritan, he's dressing
he's getting ready for the show
he's going to the carnival tonight
on Desolation Row
I should get going.
Yeah, dinner's at 7: 00.
Hush-a-bye, baby.
hush quite a lot.
bad babies get rabies and have to be shot.
Hush-a-bye, baby. Hush quite a lot.
bad babies get rabies and have to be shot.
good.
it's gruesome.
it's like Edgar Allan Poe.
Oh, you like Edgar Allan Poe?
I like The Raven.
me, too.
now, can you repeat the rhyme?
no. - It's okay.
do it with me.
hush...
A-bye, baby. - Hush-a-bye, baby.
hush quite a lot.
bad babies get rabies...
and have to be shot.
do it again.
Hush-a-bye, baby.
hush quite a lot.
bad babies get rabies and have to be shot.
that's good.
Hi, Celia.
I'll have some macaroni and some vegetables, and I'm gonna take some Jell-o.
Gabriel, what about you?
Gabriel?
Hi.
Hi. I'm Gabriel.
I remember.
I'm Celia.
Cecilia...
you're breakin' my heart.
he always says that to me.
sorry.
I -- I don't remember things so well.
truckin'...
got my chips cashed in
keep truckin'...
like the doo-dah man
together
more or less in line
just keep truckin'on...
I love the Dead.
they're my absolute favorite band.
flashing marquees out on Main Street...
you know what song this is?
sorry. Thanks for playing.
it's called Truckin'.
hang it up and see what tomorrow brings
guess I'm a bit square.
dallas, got a soft machine...
maybe a perfect square,
I'm sorry. I'm a little lost.
in my music, a guy likes a gal, he tells her.
he says, "You are the promised kiss of springtime that makes the lonely winter seem long.
it's plain English as far as I can tell.
this is-- I don't know.
Truckin'? What is that?
most of the cats that you meet on the street
speak of true love...
well, the Dead grew up on the road traveling from place to place, taking one road after another.
and the thing is, on the road, you never really know where you're going or what's gonna happen when you arrive, so you just experience the ride.
and then every single day is a different adventure.
you know, the-- the journey is the destination.
and that's what that means?
that's what that means when you're stoned.
I think that's what that means.
sometimes the light's all shinin'on me
let's do another one.
other times, I can barely --
Gabriel, I just want you to know how much I'm enjoying this.
thank you for explaining all that to me.
all what?
good. Now let's try something else.
let's go back to the gruesome rhyme.
I don't know it.
just try and tap it out.
just try.
all right, keep going. Keep going.
keep going. I'm gonna do it with you.
again.
babies get rabies and have to be shot.
all right, now...

so listen up for your favorite artist and call 234-9462.
because it's happening now.
what on God's earth are you doing?
Ah, man,
I dig this song. Oh.
you know what song this is?
for What It's Worth by Buffalo Springfield.
right on, Dad.
tellin' me I got to beware
I think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound...
I remember the last time I heard this song.
when, Gabriel?
we just found out Mark was drafted.
I was so mad.
I went up to my room and played this song.
you know, it just made me feel like somebody understood.
then you told me to turn it down.
time we stop, hey, what's that sound...
it's the same time you came in to tell me you were gonna come hear me play at the school.
what a trip.
what a field day for the heat...
you know, I didn't know Mark got his letter that day.
you didn't tell me.
when was I supposed to tell you?
mostly say hooray for our side It's time we stop, hey, what's that sound...
I mean, how is he, anyway?
is he okay?
has anybody heard from him?
he died, Gabriel...
in vietnam.
I'm sorry.
Ah, it's that asshole, Nixon.
why can't people see that?
you know, if people would just tune in for a second, they'd see what a son of a bitch the guy is.
nixon's not president anymore, Gabriel.
he had to resign.
he was caught lying to the country.
see, I knew it!
I told you!
Yeah.
you were right.
what's that sound?
everybody look what's goin'down...
I was?
Hey, what's that sound?
everybody look what's goin'down...
you were.
I was.
you better stop now
what's that sound?
everybody look what's goin'
you better stop, hey, what's that sound?
everybody look what's goin'
you better stop...
Hey, Gabriel.
it's Celia.
you know, Celia...
you know.
I know who you are.
good. 'cause I'm a terrible singer.
no, you're not.
I never met anyone who could sing in so many keys at once.
that's a rare gift.
thank you.
here. Let's sing your song.
what's that?
Oh, Celia
works in the cafe
how are you today, oh, Celia?
sing it with me.
no, no, no. You--You go.
come on. Nobody's listening.
okay.
Oh, Celia
works in the cafe
how are you today, oh, Celia?
that's great.
I'll sing the harmony now.
okay.
Oh, Celia
works in the cafe
how are you today, oh, Celia?
nice.
good. We could go on tour.
I don't have that kind of confidence.
you should.
you could do anything.
well if anyone could convince me, you could.
I should get home.
Bye, Gabriel.
peace.
peace.
he's doing well.
Yes.
it's quite something.
he's remembering rhythms.
we've even started working on putting information to beats.
do you think it might be possible that he could form a new long-term memory?
you know, if he could connect it to a piece of music?
Gabriel's progressed more than anyone I ever worked with.
it would have to be a new piece of music, one that he doesn't already have long-term connections with.
that would be something.
kind woman
don't leave me...
it's Tamara's favorite song.
it actually
it's sort of our song.
you know, like you and Mom have Till There Was You.
Hey, do you remember that night that I tried to go to the Dead concert?
you would remember it as college night.
Yeah. Rings a bell.
we caught a ride to Stonybrook, but we were late.
the tickets were sold out.
we just wanted to hear that concert so bad that we sat outside, freezing cold, by this lake, just listening.
after the concert, this song was playing on the radio.
we found a way to warm ourselves up.
won't you love me tonight...
it was her first time.
Oh.
it was mine, too.
kind woman...
Oh.
well, I guess Kind Woman was an appropriate song.
then you told me I couldn't see her anymore.
Oh, Mr. Sawyer, please sit down.
Hey, Tambourine Man. It's Celia.
Mr. Tambourine Man" to you.
come on in. Do you want a tour of my pad?
sure.
this is the living room with a groovy new, uh...
cassette deck.
cassette deck!
nice.
that man is not a permanent fixture.
that is my sound engineer.
he's my Dad.
over here, we have the bedroom.
it does the trick.
here. I brought you something.
is it my birthday?
no, It's, um
it's a going-away present.
I'm going back to school.
don't leave me lonely tonight...
you've been special to me, so I wanted to give you something.
say it's all right
Why--why are you going?
well, I've never finished.
man, you girls sure do have a thing about finishing school.
what do you mean, Gabe?
Tamara, she's finishing school, too.
that's why she didn't come with me to the village.
go ahead.
open it.
Ah. Dylan.
let's play it.
it's got Mr. Tambourine Man on it.
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man
play a song for me
I'm not sleepy...
Dylan, man. He gets it.
you get it, too, Gabriel.
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man
play a song for me
I'm gonna miss hearing you play.
I'll come followin' you
though I know that evening's empire
has returned into sand
vanished from my hand...
I hope we see each other again soon.
but still not sleeping
my weariness amazes me
I am branded on my feet...
you know, I don't know if I'll remember meeting you.
so, uh...
I'll have the great pleasure of meeting you again for the first time.
play a song for me
I'm not sleepy
and there is no place I'm going to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man
play a song for me
in the jingle-jangle morning
I'll come followin' you
Hey, this is WDED, calling out with tickets to the sold-out Dead concert at Hammerstein Ballroom.
think you're a Deadhead?
call 555-8659.
the tenth caller will get a chance to answer the Deadhead mega question.
for two tickets, 555-8659.
I feel so strong that I can't disguise, oh, my
let's spend the night together...
Henry Albert Sawyer, what have you done?
let's spend the night together...
good Lord.
don't let me down
we could have fun just --
I wonder if I could have this dance.
there were bells on a hill
no, I never heard them at all
till there was you
there were birds in the sky
but I never saw them winging
no, I never saw them at all
till there was you
what's wrong?
I think my cooking gave me indigestion.
Henry?
Gabe, honey, your father's not feeling well, and he can't come to see you for a while, but we'd like you to spend Christmas at home so you can see him.
What--what's wrong with him?
he's having some problems with his heart.
don't worry.
he just needs to rest.
listening to the Hound Dog and the Midnight Hour block of rock.
you know what time it is?
for the third caller to receive tickets to the Grateful Dead show at the Hammerstein Ballroom.
caller number three.
WDED. Can you hold?
Yes.
hello. Can you hold?
Yes, I'll hold.
okay. Turn your radio down, please.
hello. You're on the air. Who am I talking to?
Henry Sawyer.
where you calling from, Henry Sawyer?
from, uh--from my bed at City Hospital.
no kidding! What are you in for?
I had a little heart attack.
a heart attack! How old are you, Henry?
65! Holy mackerel. And you're a Deadhead?
listen, I can't talk too loud, or they'll take my phone away.
here's a question just for you.
what did the aging hippie say when he ran out of pot at the Grateful Dead concert?
I don't know.
this music sucks.
just kidding with you. That's not your question.
okay, then, Heart-Attack Henry, let's get to your real trivia question.
for two tickets to see the sold-out Grateful Dead concert at Hammerstein Ballroom, what 1970 Grateful Dead hit was banned from radio airplay because it used the word "damn"?
Hello, Henry? You there?
that would be Uncle John's Band, and it's not "damn." It's "God damn,
and I just won myself some goddamn Grateful Dead tickets!
right?
Yes, you did, Henry!
you're absolutely right.
are we ready? I've got the medication.
I've got the bag.
I've got the brain tumor.
Oh, Gabe, now stop that.
welcome home.
here.
I'll do it, Henry.
Nah, I'm fine.
Oh, stubborn old coot.
I'll start dinner.
okay.
I took your posters down.
Why?
well...
that night
the night you left, uh...
I was angry.
Yeah, I know.
I came up here. I saw the posters and the records.
I thought they were the reason.
it was a confusing time, Gabriel, I
I thought all that stuff seemed to be hurting you.
you thought my posters were hurting me?
the whole thing, all of it, you know, not just the posters, but
it was a long time ago, Gabe.
yeah? How long ago?
long time.
dashing through the snow
in a one-horse open sleigh
o'er the fields we go
laughing all the way
bells on bobtail ring
making spirits bright
what fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight
jingle bells, jingle bells
jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride...
Hi. - Hi.
your father called me.
actually, I've been wanting to see you for a long time now.
in a one-horse open sleigh
y-you cut your hair.
no. It's just up.
it's up.
well, you look beautiful.
thank you.
well, you must've finished school by now.
I went to college in New York, NYU.
far out. Did you see Dylan?
have you seen the Dead?
I did see them at the Fillmore.
Oh, right on.
what?
you cut your hair.
you look beautiful.
thank you.
so how's Mark?
I mean, you must have heard from him.
he died, Gabriel, in vietnam.
Tamara, I'm sorry.
thank you. It was a long time ago.
how long ago?
almost 20 years now.
man.
time flies when you don't have a brain.
can I hug you?
you can get into bed with me if you want.
nobody would hear us.
no, I'm
I have a family now.
I'm married.
Wow. That was fast.
this is my husband Will.
you would like him. He's a really good guy.
he's short.
he's sitting.
that's Mark.
he is short, but he's eight, and Colin is five, and Jane is two.
wow, you've been busy.
I never got married. I never had any kids.
I mean, not that I know of.
who are they?
that's Will, my husband, and Mark is eight.
Colin is five.
Jane is two.
merry Christmas
merry Christmas...
there's one more, Gabriel.
your father couldn't wait to give this to you.
Helen, just let him open it.
a trumpet?
people all over the world could just see them, too...
the Dead.
I've never been to a Grateful Dead concert in my life!
me neither.
there's magic in the air with the --
Hey, Danny Partridge, you gonna play me a song?
I'm Gabriel.
Where's Celia?
Oh, she's not here, my man,
I'm here to take care of you.
what's your pleasure?
Celia.
Ah, sorry, my friend. I can't help you with that one.
hello.
is this the Sawyer residence?
Yes. Who's calling?
what's wrong?
Gabriel.
sir, can I help you?
this is my son.
are you Mr. Sawyer? - Yeah.
okay, look, we were called by the woman that lives here.
she said that your son was banging on the upstairs window.
this was his old girlfriend's house.
okay.
well, it looks like he fell off that gutter.
he may have landed on his ankle.
we should get him to the hospital, all right?
thank you.
Hey, buddy.
you hurt your leg.
I didn't hurt my leg.
no, I think you did.
we're gonna take a little ride to the hospital, okay?
okay. - Give me your hand.
it's gonna be okay.
I don't see how this is a good idea.
the Grateful Dead?
couldn't it be something more manageable, like Lionel Richie?
the Grateful Dead has special meaning for Gabriel.
dianne, there are legitimate concerns about sending Gabriel into that kind of unpredictable, foreign environment.
Yes, but the environment Gabriel wakes up in every morning is more foreign to him than a Grateful Dead concert.
we can control that environment.
Mr. Sawyer, you're in no condition to ensure Gabriel's well-being.
a coronary patient escorting a severe amnesiac to a Grateful Dead concert?
under the circumstances
it's not just for Gabriel.
look, I lost my boy for 20 years.
that's my fault, and I know that.
even after we found him, we thought he was lost.
and he's had surgery, physical therapy, every maintenance drug known to man.
none of it did a thing.
but when he hears a Grateful Dead song, he comes back to us.
you've all seen it.
I know I'm the last guy in the world you'd peg as a Deadhead, and, believe me, if I could pick another band that would bring my boy to life, I would.
but I've learned every Grateful Dead song, every lyric, because it's the only way I can talk to Gabriel.
now, I am 65 years old, and, yes, I'm sick, and I need to have a conversation with my son.
I think I went to high school with that guy.
I don't think you know him, pal.
Hey, old-timer, old-timer.
you should get a t-shirt.
they're 100% hemp.
no, thanks.
what's so funny?
that's funny.
you think that's funny?
Yeah, Julie, look at this hat.
Uh-oh. Grandpa's comin'...
Oh, the Dead!
look over there. That's the bootleg section.
we have to get a tape of this show.
when are they coming on? The Dead!
Where's Pigpen?
I wonder where Pigpen is.
pigpen! Pigpen! Pigpen! Pigpen!
maybe he's sick or something.
Oh, he parties a lot.
Pigpen's not with the Dead anymore.
what do you mean not with them?
what, did he get busted or something?
no. He died, pal.
that's awful.
that's Jerry Garcia.
that's Phil Lesh.
I wonder where Pigpen is.
ladies and gentlemen...
the Grateful Dead!
the Dead! The Dead! We want the Dead!
truckin'
got my chips cashed in
I'm truckin'
like the doo-dah man
together
more or less in line
just keep truckin' on
arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit, and it's all on the same street
your typical city involved in a typical daydream
hang it up and see what tomorrow brings
sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
other times, I can barely see
lately it occurred to me
what a long
strange trip it's been
must be getting early
clocks are running late
paint by number morning sky
looks so phony...
it's weird.
I never heard this song before.
light a candle, curse the glare...
maybe it's a new song.
it's all right...
maybe.
I will get by
I will get by
I will get by...
dad.
you're the greatest.
I see you've got your list out
say your piece and get out
Yes, I get the gist of it, but
it's all right...
that was fantastic! It was
Ah, I had the time of my life.
it blew my mind.
me, too.
I mean, I'm always gonna remember this.
what do you want to hear next?
um, Box of Rain?
Oh, uh, put on Ripple.
that's a great one.
Yeah.
they're so great.
they just-- They play what's in the air.
they play the moment.
Yeah. I know what you mean.
they're trippy.
Yeah.
if my words did glow
they're trippy.
with the gold of sunshine
and my tunes
were played on the harp unstrung
would you hear my voice through the music？
you're right. They don't just
they don't just play the notes on the page.
no.
no, they play what's in the air, you know?
Yeah.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
the thoughts are broken
perhaps they're better
left unsung
I don't know...
don't really care
I will survive
I will survive
I will survive
I will survive
I don't remember the last time I stayed out this late.
me neither.
I had a wonderful time tonight.
Yeah.
okay. Good night, pal.
good night, Dad.
Gabriel, what are you doing?
I'm looking for something.
what are you looking for?
Gabriel, honey, we need to go.
I don't know what he's looking for.
Gabriel...
you're missing your father.
what do you mean?
dad comes every day at 10 A. M.
honey...
he can't come anymore.
your father passed away.
we're going now to say goodbye.
what?
he--he was only, like, 50.
no, Gabriel. He was 65.
as a last rite,
Henry requested that we play one of his favorite songs, and he asked that you all take a moment and listen to the music and enjoy it as he did.
all right.
I see you've got your list out
say your piece and get out
Yes, I get the gist of it, but
it's all right
sorry that you feel that way
only thing there is to say
every silver lining's got a
here comes the chorus!
touch of grey
I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive
it's a lesson to me
the Ables and the Bakers and the seas
abcs
we all must face
and try to keep a little grace...
mom, you know what song this is?
no, Gabe. What song is it?
it's Touch of Grey, the Grateful Dead.
you know when I first heard this song?
no, Gabe.
why don't you tell me?
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive
the shoe is on the hand it fits
there's really nothing much to it
whistle through your teeth and spit, 'cause
it's all right
Oh, well, a touch of grey
kind of suits you anyway
that was all I had to say
it's all right
I will get by
all the kids, they want today
all they ever think about's about summer
it's about summer
all the kids, they want today
look you in the eye and say it's okay
it's about summer
it's about summer
thoughtful and patient
they easily open their mind
through the eyes of a child
this world is truly divine
divine
all the kids, they want today
the world's problems go away
it's about summer
it's about summer
all the neighborhood cats and dogs
all wanna get along in the summer
it's all about summer
it's about
it's about summer one another
and one another
it's about the summer
it's about summer
it was an ordinary day...
it's almost 3: 00. Let's do this thing.
there were nine of us...
most of us strangers.
we all ended up in the bank.
all for different reasons.
and then in an instant... - Now.
our lives changed. - Aah!
this will all be over in five minutes.
52 hours later ...we came out of there no longer strangers, bonded forever by what we went through.
what happened in there?
only we know for now.
get down! Get down!
don't shoot! I'm unarmed!
I'm the cop! I'm the cop! - Please help her. Please!
stay with me, Eva. - This is her father.
what is happening?
it's okay, honey. He'll be right out.
we're gonna nail these bastards.
they're never gonna see the light of day again.
no one was supposed to get hurt.
Where's the negotiator?
well, clearly, you're not happy about some of our decisions.
you go public with that, we'll go right at your credibility.
do you want to talk about it? - About what?
about what happened in there.
daddy, I don't remember anything.
what happened to her in there?
Eva's dead. She died.
look, she wouldn't have been alive as long as she was if it wasn't for you.
I'm in trouble.
maybe.
you were going to tell me something. - I'm pregnant.
you never said anything, I mean, the whole time that we were in the bank.
Nick, everything would've gone down a lot worse if you hadn't have been there.
if you want to make an issue about what happened on the outside, - I'll back you up. - That's not gonna be so simple for you.
how's it feel to be a hero? - A hero?
why would you do that, Egan?
risk your life for people you don't even know?
egan and I organized a get together tonight.
you know, we shouldn't lose contact.
everybody came.
Hey, where's Felicia?
Hi.
this will all be over in five minutes.
your gun...
hour 1 - 3: 06 PM
on the floor, slowly.
nobody gets hurt here.
everybody, hands up!
that means you, now!
kick it over.
get over here now. Come on!
you two pretty little ladies, outta there!
and do not even think about touching those alarm buttons.
you! Away from the door.
we can't. It's locked.
come on. Let's go, gorgeous.
you...
lift up his pant legs.
it's okay. We're gonna be okay.
move it, lady! - Okay, okay.
come on! - Okay, okay. I'm... I'm moving.
over there.
you two, over there.
let's go. Let's go!
higher.
that was my only gun.
he's clean.
all right, get up.
you're making a big mistake here, robbing a bank - with a cop inside. - Oh, yeah?
don't. - If you get out of here right now, you've barely even committed a felony.
stop, stop. - Shut up. Shut up!
just do what he says.
well, I appreciate your concern, ma'am, but we got the cameras covered.
as far as a felony...
how's that, huh?
I need your cell phones. Dump 'em on the floor, all of you.
Where's your phone?
what the hell is that?
I don't know.
you don't know why your sleeve is blue?
Hey! Come on. You don't have to do that.
look, he just went to the bathroom.
maybe it got wet in there.
it's all right, Mr. Foote. Just, try to explain whatever... went on.
I... I dropped my wedding ring in the toilet.
how the hell did you do that?
I was gonna flush it and I changed my mind.
all right, let's get on with this.
who's in charge here? - I am.
take me to the vault.
I just have to get my keys.
now! - They're in my desk.
all right!
everybody else down on the floor on your stomachs.
this will be over in five minutes. - Okay.
are you all right?
follow me.
11 days later.
Hi.
Hi.
you're not that surprised to see me.
nothing would surprise me at this point.
so you're okay that I'm here?
not like I get a lot of visitors.
it's a pretty big story, you know?
all of this.
not exactly what I had in mind.
so I guess there's gonna be a trial, huh?
a big one, looks like.
do you have a good lawyer?
we'll see.
I hear they're keeping your brother at the same hospital that it was the closest one to the bank.
why are you here?
I've been thinking about it, you know?
everything that... happened in there, and...
Yeah, well, try not to think too much.
just get back to your life. Forget about me.
but please, I just... - Forget about me, Felicia.
and don't come back here.
no. No, Lucas.
well, it was a great idea, getting together.
and a great place.
my fries were kinda cold. - Yeah, yeah.
so, uh, same time next week?
Oh, sure. - Sure.
Yeah.
all right. - Come on. Let's go, kiddo.
Oh, I'm telling you, I'm fine.
I had, like, two margaritas three hours ago.
young lady, I am driving you home. Understood? - Fine.
good night, everybody.
good night. - Good night.
night.
you haven't told him yet? - No.
I hate to break it to you, but you're not gonna be able to hide it much longer.
walk you to your car?
sure.
night, everybody.
night. - Night.
you still have some stuff at my place.
Yeah, my guitar.
Yeah, a few t-shirts, tennis racket...
your first edition Unbearable Lightness of Being.
you want me to bring it in to work for you?
did you come here with Franny?
did I...? No.
no.
we bumped into each other out front.
it's okay if you did.
I thought it was good that she wasn't alone.
no, we didn't.
okay.
so are we done?
I need some time to think.
two years...
two years, and we just flush it down the drain with barely a conversation.
I just said I need some time to think.
right.
well, you know where to find me.
Yeah.
safe drive.
so the department wants to make you their mascot.
I prefer "poster boy."
it makes sense... Pin a medal on you and put you out front.
the department gets some good PR.
it certainly helps take the stink off of how they handled things and keeps my mouth shut.
I know it's kinda slimy, the way they're dealing with things, but...
you do deserve a medal, or a promotion or, whatever else you might want from them.
two people are dead.
one of 'em was shot with my gun.
there was nothing that you could've done about Eva.
I should go.
uh, get some sleep.
everybody say yeah!
say yeah! - Good morning, Los Angeles, and welcome to "The LA Morning Show."
and a fantastic morning it is, isn't it?
it's great out, and we've got a great lineup, starting with the unlikely hero from last week's fidelity republic bank hostage standoff.
please welcome a very brave man: Egan Foote.
so, Egan... - Yes.
Egan. - That's me.
the moment that we've all been waiting for.
you've been trapped in the bank for over two days, the SWAT team comes busting in, and you...
you manage to take down your brutal captor - Randall Reese. - That's right.
how did you do that?
well, carpe diem, Josh.
the day was there, and I seized it.
and you almost took a bullet from SWAT in the process.
uh, uh, lucky, I guess. I came out of it with a...slight concussion and a new lease on life.
Ricky, breakfast is ready. Now come to the table.
let's... let's go back a minute to how the whole thing began, because we understand that a 9-1-1 call came from with inside the bank.
uh, well, it began with two men wanting to rob the bank.
right, but the standoff, that happened because 9-1-1 was called and then the police showed up.
Yeah, that's right.
and then all hell broke loose from there.
please help my sister! - Hey, get off me!
Ricky, come on. - Yeah, essentially.
so if you were in a situation like that again...
uh, heaven forbid... - Have sharon draw up a motion in limine to keep the mother's statement out.
here's the Cummins' complaint.
make sure that it's filed today. Thank you.
cause, you know, there's a lot of speculation - mismanaged the situation. - Do you want me to draft...
hang on a second.
you're someone who saw everything that went on inside.
what's your position on that?
well, I'm no expert on police procedure, but as far as I can tell, um...
well, let's just say, it seemed like they could've handled it a lot differently.
better, I mean.
and what about the cop who was inside with you?
a hero in there.
without him, I don't know how we would've gotten through it.
sounds like you two are close. - We all are now.
come on!
nobody gets hurt here.
so you all right?
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
well, last night must have been a good warm-up for you.
the party, you know, seeing all your friends.
Oh, yeah. I guess.
listen, honey, if you can't handle it, you just say the word, I'll take you home.
no, dad, seriously, I gotta do this sooner or later.
all right?
that's my girl.
all right, I love you, sweetheart.
you be good now. - See you later.
morning.
Frank Waters, 43, severe cardiomyopathy.
he's been on a pump for two months waiting for a transplant.
UNOS found a match yesterday in San Diego.
the transplant should take about ten hours, so...
his wife is going to need some hand-holding today.
Where's Frank now?
ICU.
have you... been up there yet?
I mean, since Randall's been up there.
no. You?
no.
Hey, Tessa.
this is our social worker Lizzie Miller.
how's he doing?
um, okay.
he's a... a bit scared,
well, that... that's to be expected.
uh, let me talk to you... what has to happen now, okay?
Lizzie, you coming?
but that is the thing about facing your fears.
seriously.
well, it's been great having you here on the show, Egan.
thank you so much. And before...you get back to your life, we understand that there's one more thing you'd like to say.
Yes, uh, thank you.
well, um...
well, you see, there was, um...
there was one of us... Her name was Eva Rios...
and she didn't make it out of there. She was killed.
and she left behind a little boy... Ricky.
his father's in prison.
his aunt Franny... She was in there with us, too...
now she's gotta raise him on her own.
they don't have very much money.
and, uh, Eva didn't work at the bank long enough to have any pension or
I'm asking those of you at home who may have an extra $5 or $10 to please call this number and, um, make a donation.
you get a hit on that plate I asked you to run?
just came in.
it's a federal plate.
bureau, actually.
what's this about?
you've come to a decision I hope.
not quite.
you got any idea why the FBI might be tailing me?
I imagine they want to pressure you, otherwise, you never would've made them.
pressure me?
everybody wants you to step up, Nick.
take one for the team.
the FBI can't exactly put their negotiator out front for the photo-ops.
they'll settle for you.
so what's next, bugging my phone, burning a cross on my lawn, what?
no, just an extra request. - What's that?
the department would like to set up something for you at city hall.
the commissioner will be there, someone from the FBI, the DA's office.
you'll get your medal and your promotion...
and you'll also say a few words about how proud you are of the job everybody did.
pr department typed up something for you.
you can tweak it a bit, but you get the gist.
so this isn't just about me keeping my trap shut.
I gotta be your mouthpiece now.
this is an easy choice, Nick.
you're right.
I quit.
so guess what I came up with.
an expert witness for the McManus hearing?
close. - Hmm.
a hearsay exception for the Holloway trial?
not Holloway.
Hollywood, as in bowl, as in garden box for Elvis Costello.
tonight?
backstage passes.
you're good.
I've been told. - Kathryn.
I have Nick Cavanaugh on the phone.
we got to prep for Petrocelli. - All right, I'll be right there.
line two. - Thank you.
Hey, there. - I quit my job.
what happened?
a fed tailed me to the diner last night.
I spotted him after you left.
the feds?
they're trying to bully me.
they want me to get out in front of the cameras and say that everything they did was all right.
so you quit? What are you gonna do now?
go after them.
the cops? The feds? - Everybody.
are you still there?
Yeah, yeah. I'm just, um...
I'm just taking it in.
somebody has got to pay for what happened.
Lucas and randall will pay. Isn't that enough?
is that enough for you?
look, I...
I know what I said at the funeral. It's just, um...
I'm trying to move forward.
well, things happened in that bank that involve you.
if I talk to the press, to whoever, they're gonna come to you.
I just want to know what I'm up against.
am I alone in this?
fine. I get it.
time to move on.
can you tell me your name?
you know you're not supposed to be in here.
I know. I...
how's Frank doing?
okay considering he's about to undergo a heart transplant.
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.
I freaked out this morning, - left you alone with them. - It's fine.
you know, I'm not as bad with the patients as you think.
I wish Randall was dead.
you just gotta put your head down and do your thing.
they're waiting for me.
thank you so much for coming in.
we'll let you know one way or the other next week.
excuse me, Malcolm.
Yes.
I have Tom's last check here.
should I just send it to his home or...
um, no, his wife wants us to deposit that directly.
thank you.
what are you doing out here?
uh, I came by...
I wanted to thank you for organizing the fund with Egan.
I wanted to come inside, but...
I can't.
I thought I would try, you know?
but...
I can't.
well, you don't have to rush.
there'll always be a job for you here.
no. Actually, I don't...
I don't think I'll ever be able to go in there.
okay. well, I'll, um,
I'll write you a reference, and I'll make whatever calls you need.
Oh, uh, I never finished processing that mortgage application for the Malones.
it's still in my drawer.
it's under the PO forms.
I really wanted to do that, you know?
I... I really appreciate you giving me a chance.
you always gave me a chance.
you always deserved it.
well, thanks.
listen, I'll tell you what,
why don't I go inside and I'll get your things, okay?
Eva, no!
what?
Monica Turner from the Times.
okay, thanks.
Kathyrn, how's it going?
good, fine. Just getting back into the swing of things. What's up?
well, I'm not sure if there's a conflict of interest here, but just wanted to feel it out with you.
go ahead.
I got a tip about Nick Cavanaugh.
yeah?
apparently, the bank teller Eva Rios was shot with his gun.
and I'm also hearing he was a problem in there...
butting heads with the negotiator, impeding the police in his own department.
is there any truth to that?
where are you getting this information from?
you know I can't tell you that.
is someone on the department leaking it to you?
is it true?
let me call you back, and don't do anything until you hear from me.
okay.
I'm with you.
so how's Randall doing?
the doctors say he'll be out of ICU tomorrow.
they're calling him Rasputin - down at the DA's office. - Funny.
well, they can joke all they want.
we need him to live.
why is that?
well, if he dies, the prosecution will try to pin everything on you.
which doesn't go so much with my plan to pin everything on him.
I told you the robbery was my idea.
and we will deal with the robbery as a distinct issue.
I'm trying to get you off on the felony murder charges.
you do want that, right? - Obviously.
well, we're gonna need to put some hostages on the stand.
will any of them testify on your behalf?
I don't know.
what about the Jones girl?
Felicia is it? - What about her?
I heard she visited you last night.
juries love sweet, teenage faces.
you stay away from her.
Lucas... - No, I mean it.
I know you think I'm gonna be your OJ but you go anywhere near her,
I'll fire you and go back with the public defender.
got it?
I'm not just talking about making it easier for the customer.
I'm talking about making it more fulfilling for us.
corporate will never go for it, Egan.
what do you mean, "Corporate will never go for it?
how do you know until we've tried?
I don't remember calling a staff meeting.
no, I... I was just, uh...
pitching...
some of my new ideas to everybody.
Really? And what are those?
Really? Well, all right, for starters, um...
a paper-free, internet-based system that tracks insurance claims in real time.
Paper-free?
Yeah, now we'd have some cash outlay for computer hardware up front, but it would pay for itself in increased efficiency, not to mention save us from...
from drowning in pointless triplicate forms.
don't leave out the most important part, Egan.
Yes, good. Thank you. Yeah.
it would keep sick people from having to haggle for their money all day when they should be worried about their treatment.
well...
I think it's a great idea, Egan, except for one small problem.
okay, what's that?
the inefficiency, as you call it, is how we make our profit.
without it, you're out of a job, which you'll all be anyway if you don't get back to work.
and, Egan...
Yeah.
you got any more appearances I should know about?
because I need you here on time.
he's just a jerk.
it's fine.
just an idea.
Hey!
it's taco Tuesday at the cafeteria.
you down?
I'll be there in a minute.
I need suction.
okay.
that does it for the atrial walls, superior and inferior vena cavaes and the pulmonary artery.
we'll fix the aorta, prep the paddles and get this baby humming. Let me have a 4-0 prolene.
I said a 4-0, Terry.
this is an aortic anastomosis, not your stitch-and-bitch group.
guess some people never change.
and this plan of yours, this is at what point in the standoff?
about halfway through it.
after reese had killed the security guard and it was clear that negotiations were going nowhere.
I just want to make clear that Nick offehimself as a sole hostage.
he had Reese and Dalton convinced that they were gonna make it out of there.
this plan would've worked. - Right.
now about the security guard, is it true that you had an opportunity to get him out, - but that your mother was released? - Now that was protocol, Monica.
the man was wounded.
he was conscious and alert.
Dalton wouldn't have allowed it anyway.
by the way, the real question is...
why negotiations broke down so badly that Nick had to be the one to deal with it on the inside.
Hello, Monica. Good to see you.
Deputee District Attorney.
Kathryn, can I borrow you for a second?
Yeah, sure. Excuse me.
what are you doing here? - Walls have ears, Kat.
the question is what are you doing here?
helping a friend. - Helping him do what?
make our case against Dalton and Reese more difficult by casting the cops as bad guys?
saying that the cops on the outside screwed up shouldn't hurt your case if you do your job right.
but I appreciate your concern for your career.
well, it might do you some good to think about your own.
look, if you side with him, you will alienate everyone in the LAPD and the FBI, not to mention quite a few people in your own office.
and you can certainly kiss any political aspirations you have good-bye. That'll be gone.
they were gonna throw him to the wolves.
I didn't have a choice.
look, I know what you went through together.
no, I don't think you do.
I understand you feel you owe him in some way, okay?
but do you even have any idea what you are getting into with this guy, who he is?
is there something we should all be talking about?
Nick... - No, no.
it's all right, Kathryn.
we may as well get everything out in the open here, right, Nick?
I'm all ears.
I was just wondering if you bothered telling her about your past.
what about it?
well, maybe about your gambling problem,
the one that blew a huge case for your department and put other cops at risk.
the one that landed you on probation and got you his close to getting tossed out on your ass.
now you think Monica Turner doesn't know about that?
isn't gonna lead with that in a story like this?
I think she's gonna lead with what's relevant.
my past has nonothing to do with anything.
well, I think that's a little naive.
you do what you gotta do.
but I'd appreciate it if you'd let me know either way.
gambling problem?
I've got an ex-wife, too.
she's not gonna say nice things about me.
next time you want me to go out on a limb with you, you better be straight with me.
I'm sorry.
where were we?
are you still interviewing for a new teller?
tellers now.
Franny quit.
Oh, well.
I never thought she'd go back.
well, anyway, I haven't found anyone yet to replace them.
you know, the therapist said it might be helpful if you go in there with Felicia at some point.
it might be good for you, too.
you know, to talk to somebody.
or you could talk to me.
I know I can.
do you?
what?
you don't want to be here, do you?
mm, you're good.
you know, I feel like people don't even believe me.
believe you?
that I lost my memory.
like who?
I don't know, people at school, my mom sometimes.
well, why wouldn't people believe you?
maybe they think I'm trying to get attention or something.
are you?
so you don't believe me either?
that's just great.
Felicia, I didn't say...
I mean, what the hell do you think I been coming here every day for?
is there anyone else you can talk to, any of the other hostages?
I've tried a little, but...
but what?
nobody wants to deal with me.
everybody just wants the whole thing to go away.
okay.
lookin' good, folks. Lookin' good.
I'm just gonna give him one last...
I got a bleeder.
what's the BP Mike?
uh, 80 and falling. 70.
it's the aorta.
everything else is holding.
Oh, stay with me now, Frank.
save her! Oh, my god! - 70. 65.
there she is.
I've got it under control.
I got you Franck, I got you.
stop the music, please.
can you tell me your name?
my name's Tom. - Okay, Tom.
I had my doubts about Dr. Kates, you know, for him to operate so soon after...
but, um, Frank was adamant.
Dr. Kates would never have performed surgery if he wasn't ready.
Yeah, that's what Frank said.
he, uh, has so much faith in people.
there were some minor complications, but he's looking good now. He's stable.
thank you!
thank you.
I didn't know what I was gonna do.
how I was gonna raise Chloe if...
thank you so much.
thank you.
you have five minutes.
I heard you and Kathryn Hale talked to a reporter today.
so?
that was a big mistake.
we'll see.
what are you trying to prove here?
is this about the girl, what?
her name is Eva.
look, mistakes were made. We all regret them.
but there's plenty of blame to go around, including some for you.
I never said any different.
so you want to be a crusader now,
with no job, no paycheck?
you got a habit to support, my friend.
is that what you called me here for?
you may not care about your own ass, but how about your friends?
your buddy Egan Foote...
he carried an unregistered, concealed weapon into the bank.
that's a felony.
what are you doin', Pete?
and then, of course, there's Eva's sister Franny.
I bet you didn't know she had an ounce of pot and ten hits of ecstasy in her purse that day.
Yeah.
we found it after we took the bank.
we've been overlooking it, considering the circumstances.
but if we decide to press charges, she could lose custody of that kid.
we just haven't had the heart to do that so far.
it's too late. We already talked to the Times.
the story can be killed.
all you have to do is call the reporter and recant.
there are bigger forces at work here than me.
take your medal.
take your promotion.
get on with your life.
...adding a T-9 report to all arthroscopic biopsies.
we'll bill another $2 per claim.
but the T-9 doesn't add information. It's pointless.
not to our shareholders, it's not.
but we're profiting from other people's pain.
well... yeah.
if you don't like it, go join the peace corps.
now I've had enough of all of this second-guessing today.
you're an employee. Your job is to hear what the company has to say and keep your mouth shut.
you don't have the right to talk to her like that.
excuse me?
you don't have the right to talk to anyone like that.
Really? I didn't realize you were suddenly in charge here, Foote.
you're just afraid, Brian.
it's okay.
bullies are always afraid.
you never listen to our ideas because you're threatened by us.
you don't stand up to corporate because you're scared of them.
don't you ever just want to let go, take charge of this place, take charge of your life, for Pete's sake, huh?
go for the gusto, Brian.
do something impetuous.
you're fired, Egan.
how's that for impetuous?
now go be a hero somewhere else.
Ricky, I told you not to do that!
why not?
because we agreed, if I let you stay home from school today that you'd behave.
huh. You don't have to keep checking up on me, you know?
I was in the neighborhood.
I'm just trying to organize a bit.
Yeah, sure.
how's it goin' there, Ricky?
pretty cool car. Is that... Whoa!
sorry. I... I didn't know what to do there.
it's okay. He's just being a brat.
I'll be right back. Hold on.
you've reached the home of Franny Rios...
Eva Rios and...
come on, Ricky. Don't be shy.
Ricky Rios.
leave a message and have a beautiful day. Thanks.
Franny, it's me.
I want to see how Ricky's doing.
if you're there, pick up.
you know, I'm the kid's father.
I deserve to know what's going on there.
I guess I'll call you tomorrow.
you've reached the home of Franny Rios...
Eva Rios and...
come on, Ricky. Don't be shy.
Ricky Rios.
leave a message and have a beautiful day. Thanks.
Oh, go, go, go, go, go.
Eva's ex called.
he, uh, left a message on the machine.
Oh, okay.
is everything okay with him?
Yeah, I think he's trying to get custody of Ricky back.
do you have a lawyer?
no. I was...
I was actually thinking of calling Kathryn.
I thought maybe she could help.
I'm sure she would.
are you hungry?
can I make you something to eat?
sure.
okay.
where are we, Mike?
he's in asystole. We intubated, but I have no pressure.
gave him two rounds of EPI, no response.
we've got tamponade. 14-gauge needle on a 60.
come on, Frank!
help her, please!
let's get him to the OR.
there's no time. He's been down for 15 minutes.
then we're gonna open him here.
prep and give me the wire cutters.
Dr. Kates, he's gone. - Give me the cutters!
okay. Here we go now, Frank.
come on!
come on, Frank!
we've done everything we could.
call it.
time of death... 2: 48 pm.
you got a visitor.
who is it? - Felicia Jones.
he says he can't see you.
what?
why not?
I'm not a concierge, miss.
why did you do that?
Why?!
why did you do that? Why?!
No! No! Please!
I'd say congratulations...
I wish you wouldn't.
you're not gonna tell me what turned this?
no.
I guess we go back to our lives now.
I guess so.
we've got a little surprise here.
Hey, buddy.
Congratulations.
Oh, Ms. Hale, we didn't realize you were gonna be here.
it would be great to get a shot with you.
actually, I... I have to be back in court.
it'll just take a minute.
no, thanks.
I... I really have to go.
the two heroes.
excuse me.
come on, honey, let's get you ready for bed.
I am no one special, just a common man with common thoughts.
I've led a common life.
there are no monuments dedicated to me.
and my name will soon be forgotten.
but in one respect,
I've succeeded as gloriously as anyone who ever lived.
looking good, Duke. - Feeling good.
I've loved another with all my heart and soul and for me that has always been enough.
how's it hanging, Harry?
I keep trying to die, but they won't let me.
well, you can't have everything.
big day today.
you say that every day, you old devil.
it's a lovely day outside.
let's take a walk.
I don't think so.
well, we've got to get you out of this room.
come on now, honey. Some fresh air - would do you good. - Hello.
I'm sorry, it's not a good day.
I don't think she's up for anything.
Hello?
this is Duke, he's come to read to you.
read? - Mm-hmm.
no. I don't know.
Oh, come on, you'll like him, he's very funny.
ahh...
all right now, where did we leave off?
Oh, yeah, yeah, it was the night of the carnival.
Noah, was there with his friends, Fin and Sarah.
Noah? - That's where they met
june 6th, 1940.
Allie was 17 years old.
little man wins a prize. - Damn!
thank you for playing. - Ha, you're real funny.
man, I clobbered that thing.
I'm tellin' you, these games are fixed.
hello. - How are you?
Hi, what's your name?
step right up here.
over the hook, yeah.
whoa.
who's this girl with Sara? - Her name's Allie Hamilton.
she's here for the summer with her family.
dad's got more money than God.
Hi, Fin! - Hi, honey.
look, I won you a prize.
Oh, Fin, thank you!
Oww! - Yeah.
hey great, huh?
hey Allie, you want some cotton candy?
umm, okay. - That would be so much fun.
you only get one chance, son.
you want to dance with me? - No.
why not? - 'Cause I don't want to.
Noah, she's with us.
hey Allie, you want to ride the Ferris wheel?
I'd love to. - All right.
excuse me.
excuse me.
Noah Calhoun. - What?
works down at the lumber yard with Fin.
Oh...
did you see he was standing like two inches away from my face?
Yeah, I saw. That's Noah, though.
you know I'm surprised he even came over.
I think he likes you.
hey what -- jerk
get off me. Don't touch me.
Hey! - Well, l... ugh!
what are you doing? - Hey, you can't do that!
I'll pay you when I get down, Tommy.
I'm Noah Calhoun.
so?! - So, it's really nice to meet you.
Allie, who is this guy? - I don't know, Noah Calhoun.
I would really like to take you out. - Friend! Do you mind?
you can't sit more than two people in a chair, Noah.
okay, Tommy, all right.
get down, Noah, you're gonna kill yourself!
Noah, cut it out.
now, will you go out with me?
what?
no. - No?
no. - No?
hey pal, she just told you.
why not?
I don't know, because I don't want to.
Noah!
what? Well, you leave me no other choice then.
Oh my God.
I'm not kidding.
Noah, stop fooling around. - What are you doing?
Noah, grab the bar. - I'm gonna ask you one more time.
will you...
or will you not go out with me? - Noah, you best come on.
God damn, my hand's slipping. - Then grab the bar, you idiot.
not until she agrees. - Ah, go on out with him, honey.
okay, okay, fine, I'll go out with you.
what? - No, don't do me any favors.
no, no. I want to.
you want to? You want to? - Yes!
say it. - I want to go out with you.
say it again. - I want to go out with you.
all right, all right we'll go out.
you think you're so smart, don't you?
that wasn't funny, Noah, you idiot!
no, it's okay, I'll take care of this.
what are you doing?
please don't do that.
please don't do that, Allie.
I can't believe...
Oh God.
you're not so cocky now, are ya?
I'm gonna get you for that.
Ah, maybe you will, maybe you won't.
did he say anything to you? - Oh, yeah, will you look at that?
it's that girl from the Carnival, right?
do you remember me?
Yeah, sure, Mr. Underwear, was it?
well, l... - How could I forget.
Yeah, I wanted to clear that up with you, because I'm really sorry about that.
it was a really stupid thing to do
crawl up a Ferris wheel to talk to somebody.
but I had to be next to you.
I was being drawn to you.
Oh-- oh, jeez, what a line!
you use that on all the girls?
no. - Right.
I saw you the other night with little Miss Ribbons.
what are you doing tonight? - What?
or tomorrow night, or this weekend, whatever.
Why? - Why? Our date.
what date?
the date that you agreed to. - No...
Yes, you did. You promised and you swore it.
well, I guess I changed my mind.
look, I know you get some dirty guy coming up to you on the street -- you don't know him.
you don't know me, but I know me.
and when I see something that I like,
I gotta ha -- I love it.
I go -- I mean, I go crazy for it.
okay, what are you talking about?
well, you.
Oh, you're good.
what? - You're good.
no. No, you're getting me wrong. - You're good. You are.
you're fantastic. - I'm not.
you really are. I'm impressed.
I'm not usually like this, I'm sorry. - Oh, yes, you are.
I can be fun, if you want...
pensive, uh, smart, uh, superstitious, brave.
and uh... I can be light on my feet.
I could be whatever you want.
you just tell me what you want and I'll be that for you.
you're dumb.
I could be that.
come on, one date. What's it gonna hurt?
umm... I don't think so.
well, what I can I do to change your mind?
guess you'll figure something out.
you sure she's coming? - Relax, pal, it's all set up.
we're meeting her for the late show.
look -- what did I tell you? Come on.
Oh my goodness, what a coincidence!
I need to talk to you for a second.
he's here! - Allie, you remember Noah, don't you?
Yes, I remember. - Yeah.
come here. - Fin!
Hi. - Hi.
it's nice to see you again. - You too.
you look great. - Aw, thanks.
really, really great.
you do look great. You look great.
and I know I look great, so could we please go see this movie?
the show's about to start. - After you.
wait for me.
what happened in that movie?
here you go. - Thank you.
what are you guys doing? - Want to walk with me?
Yeah, what's going on?
Yeah. - We're gonna walk.
do you guys love each other?
huh? Oh, I get it.
you guys do love each other. - Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
okay, good bye.
all right, all right. - Mmm...
that was fun.
Mm-hmm.
I haven't seen a movie in ages.
Really? - Huh-uh.
not since I was a little kid.
what?
no, l, uh...
I'm busy, you know, I don't have a lot of time.
you're busy? - Mm-hmm.
I have a very strict schedule.
my days are all planned out.
I get up in the morning -- breakfast, math tutor, Latin tutor, lunch, tennis lessons, dance lessons -- sometimes both
french tutor, piano lesson, then I eat dinner.
and after dinner I spend time with my family.
and then l -- I catch up on some reading.
Wow.
sounds like the road to success.
Oh, you bet.
we're applying to all these colleges
umm... Radcliffe, Sarah Lawrence -- those are the ones we want.
and who's we? - What?
you just said, "The ones that we want."
Oh, Mom and Daddy.
we decide everything together.
everything?
no, not everything.
but the important things, yes.
and then everything else, you get to decide all by yourself?
don't be rude. - I'm sorry.
just trying to figure out what you do for fun.
what do you mean?
I mean...
I don't know, I mean all those things are things you have to do, right?
so what do you do because you want to?
I just told ya.
I don't know.
this surprises me.
Why?
I just always figured you were kinda...
kinda what?
just...
free. - What?
free.
I am free.
you don't seem like it.
well, I am.
come here, I want to show you something.
Noah, what are you doing? - Just come on.
you're gonna get run over. - By all the cars?
my Dad and I used to come out here and lay down and watch the lights change.
and watch them go from green to red to yellow.
you could try it, if you wanted to.
no. - Why not?
because I don't know -- will you just get up?
that's your problem, you know that?
you don't do what you want.
okay.
what happens if a car comes?
we die. - What?
just relax. Just trust.
you need to learn how to trust.
okay.
painting. - Hmm?
you asked me what I do for me.
what now? - I love to paint.
yeah? - Mm-hmm.
huh.
most of the time, I have all these thoughts bouncing around in my head.
but with a brush in my hand, the world just gets kinda quiet.
get out of the street!
are you okay?
why are you laughing?
Oh, that was fun.
do you want to dance with me?
sure.
now? - Mm-hmm.
here? - Mm-hmm.
not supposed to dance in the middle of the street.
who said dance in the street?
and we don't have any music.
well, we'll make some.
you're a terrible singer.
I know.
but I like this song.
◎ I'll be seeing you ◎
◎ In all the old ◎
◎ Familiar places ◎
◎ That this heart of mine ◎
◎ Embraces ◎
◎ All day and through ◎
◎ In that small cafe ◎
◎ The park across the way ◎
◎ The children's carousel ◎
◎ The chestnut trees...◎ - Southern summers are indifferent to the trials of young love.
◎ The wishing well ◎ - Armed with warnings and doubts,
Noah and Allie gave a remarkably convincing portrayal of a boy and a girl traveling down a very long road with no regard for the consequences.
they fell in love, didn't they?
Yes, they did. - Good.
I like this kind of story. Go on.
after that night,
Allie and Noah spent every waking hour together.
and soon they were inseparable.
Noah, come on. - Your boat cannot beat me there.
that's really nice. - Mmm, mmm, mmm...
not bad for Whitman.
Hey, look, we got a visitor.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
well, don't apologize, come on up here, darling.
we could use a little something here besides the smell of lumber.
dad, this is Allison Hamilton.
Allison, I'm glad to meet you.
Allie. - Allie.
pleased to meet you, Mr. Calhoun.
well Mr. Calho -- What, am I old or something?
you can call me Frank.
here, come in and have a seat. - Okay.
so, Allie. Well, yeah, she is pretty, son.
Yes. - She's a lot prettier than you let on.
Oh, is that right? - No, it's not right.
don't believe what he says.
what is this you got? - Umm, l -- uh, I just
I brought you something.
let me see. Let's have a look.
did you do this? - Mm-hmm.
well, that's beautiful. Look at that.
that's a damn picture there.
well, I know just where we can put that, thank you.
Oh, that was a lovely poem.
what was it?
el --- Whitman.
see when he was a little kid he used to stutter real bad.
dad --- So -- well, you did.
I didn't know that. - God. I stammered.
stammered, stutter, what's the difference?
couldn't understand a damn thing he said.
so, I got him to read me poetry out loud.
it wasn't very pretty at first, but then his stutter went away.
well, it's a good idea, that poetry.
Yeah, I thought so. - Huh?
unbelievable, unbelievable.
I'm a Tennyson man, myself, but he likes Whitman
for some reason, I don't know.
say, how would you like some breakfast? Would you like some breakfast?
breakfast? - Yeah.
dad, it's 10: 00. - What's that got to do with it?
you can have pancakes any damn time of night you want.
come on, you want some breakfast? - Sure.
it was an improbable romance.
he was a country boy. She was from the city.
she had the world at her feet, while he didn't have two dimes to rub together.
Noah, come on.
Whoo!
look at us.
what are we doing?
do you think in another life, I could have been a bird?
what do you mean?
like reincarnation.
I don't know.
I think I could.
say I'm a bird.
no.
don't do it. - Say I'm a bird.
stop it. Stop it now.
you're not. - Say it!
you're a bird. - Yeah.
now say you're a bird too.
if you're a bird, I'm a bird.
come on, darling. - What are you doing?
don't. Don't!
here we go, on the count of three, okay?
real easy, on three, ready?
okay, okay. - One...
two -- two... - Two...
...three! - No! I can't.
get in the water!
get in! I'm sorry. - Come on, chicken.
get in the water, baby. Baby, would you get in.
get in the water. - I can't.
go! - Get in the water!
one... - Come on, jump.
two... - Three.
keep 'em together! No, no, no.
get to your place. - Down here.
and move. And keep it.
no, don't move it!
I don't understand what you're talking about.
they didn't agree on much.
in fact, they rarely agreed on everything. They fought all the time.
don't kick me! - Don't push me.
and they challenged each other every day.
but despite their differences, they had one important thing in common.
they were crazy about each other.
okay, I have to go.
no. - Yes, I do.
Allie.
daddy. Oh, Daddy you're
I didn't see you there.
you kinda scared me.
becoming friendly with that boy down there.
Yes.
bring him to the house on Sunday.
I want to meet this young man.
okay.
good night, Daddy.
good night.
Oh, boy.
this bug goes "Daddy, I don't understand."
he goes, "Well, in theory, we're both millionaires, but in reality, we live with a bunch of whores.
Bishop Stevens told me that.
olivier, please remove the -- the liquor decanter from in front of my husband.
I think he's had a little too much to drink.
I don't get it. - Pay attention.
so, what do you do, Noah?
I work at the lumber yard with Fin.
mainly milling and receiving logs -- and stripping the bark.
Oh, that's lovely, dear.
thank you.
if you don't mind my asking, uh, how much do you make at your job?
uh, how much money do I make?
Mm-hmm.
about 40 cents an hour.
Yeah, it's not much, but I don't need a lot.
and l -- I save most of it.
let's eat. Shall we?
Yes! Oh, it looks delicious.
so Noah, you and Allie have been spending a lot of time together.
you must be very fond of each other.
it's getting pretty serious, huh?
Yes, ma'am.
well, summer's almost gone. What will you do?
you know, Charleston's only a couple of hours away.
but Allie's going to Sarah Lawrence.
didn't she tell you?
no, she didn't tell me that.
I just got the letter. I was going to tell you.
it's okay.
and Sarah Lawrence is in New York.
I didn't know that.
Anne, this conversation's too stuffy for the dinner table.
let the children have fun without bringing in the Spanish lnquisition.
my lips are buttoned, right now.
I do know another joke about the Nun and the full standing bishop.
stop - That wasn't me.
I'm leaving the table if you tell another joke.
Whoo!
I'm gonna do it.
Yeah. - Yeah.
that child's got too much spirit for a girl of her circumstance.
Nah, it's just summer love.
trouble is what it is.
Mmm. - Mmm.
is that Allie out there?
do you want to go somewhere?
okay.
wait here.
Allie!
come on.
all right, take a step.
step. No, don't
all right, just stay there.
don't open your eyes.
okay.
the Windsor Plantation.
it was built in 1772.
rumor has it that Francis Marion... - Mm-hmm?
proposed to his wife right here under these -- uh, these steps.
huh? - Watch out.
you be careful, these are broken. Look at that.
this
this place is gigantic.
Yeah, a gigantic piece of crap.
it is.
but I'm gonna buy it one day and I'm gonna fix it up.
all it needs is a new floor.
and new walls and a roof.
is that all? - And plumbing and electric.
and furniture. - Yes, and furniture.
but it's right on the water.
and there's a big old barn out there
I could turn that into my workshop.
well, what about me?
now don't I get any say in this?
you want a say in this?
Yes, I would.
what do you want?
I want a white house...
with blue shutters... - Mm-hmm.
and a room overlooking the river so I can paint.
anything else? - Yes.
I want a big old porch that wraps around the entire house.
we can drink tea... - Whoa, whoa, whoa
and watch the sun go down.
okay. - You promise?
Mm-hmm, I promise.
good.
where are you going? - In here.
Wow.
I can't play chopsticks if you're doing that.
Oh, God.
Oh, make love to me.
Noah. - Yeah?
um...
I know I said that I wanted you to make love to me, - but I think you --- Yeah?
you're gonna have to talk me through this.
right. You all right? - Yeah.
did I hurt you? - No, no.
I'm just -- I'm just having a lot of thoughts.
I'm just -- I'm just having a lot of
never mind.
like what are you thinking? What are you thinking, right now?
you know, right this second?
uh.
did you know that this was going to happen when you brought me here?
no. - No?
no. - No, you didn't think about it?
of course I thought about it. - You did?
Uh-huh. - Well, what did you think?
uh, I'm talking too much, aren't l?
okay, okay, I'm just going to shut up.
mum's the word.
okay.
you all right? - Yeah.
Uh-huh. - All right.
I just don't understand how come you're so quiet.
you don't have one thought?
I'm going crazy over here, but no, with you, everything's fine.
you don't have a care in the world?
I'm sorry.
I wanted this to be so perfect.
now I can't shut up.
I love you.
did you know that?
I love you too.
Yeah.
you don't have to do this if you don't want to.
no, no, I want to, I do.
Noah! Noah!
what? Fin, get out of here!
look, I'm sorry, but Allie's parents are going crazy.
they got every cop in town out looking for her.
you sent the police for me? - Yes.
it is two in the morning. We sent the police.
thank God you're all right. Where you been?
Mr. Hamilton, all this is my fault.
would you give us a moment please?
I'd like to talk to my daughter.
alone, young lady.
thanks for everything, Lieutenant.
you bet, John, anytime.
you go straight home now, it's late.
sir, it's really not her fault.
I lost track of time.
sit down.
I'm sorry, Daddy.
is he a rapist? - No.
like what, mother? - You are going to stop seeing Noah.
she is out fooling around with that boy till 2: 00 in the morning and it has got to stop.
I didn't spend 17 years of my life raising a daughter and giving her everything...
so she could throw it away on a summer romance.
daddy, come on!
she will wind up with her heart broken or pregnant.
Anne, please. - Now, he is a nice boy.
he's a nice boy, but he's --- He's what? He's what? Tell me.
he is trash, trash, trash -- not for you.
trash?
don't touch me!
now that is enough. You are not to see him anymore. And that's final.
no, it's not final. - Yes it is.
no, it's not final! - Allie!
you're not going to tell me who I'm gonna love.
love? - Yes Daddy, I love him.
I love him.
he's not suitable for you, baby.
I love him.
you are 17 years old, you don't know anything about love.
Oh, and you do?
you don't look at Daddy the way I look at Noah.
you don't touch or laugh.
you don't play. You don't know anything about love.
Noah?
Noah?
Hey, hey.
you leaving?
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
I don't even know what to say. I'm humiliated.
it's all right. - No, it's not.
Yeah. - No, it's not.
Shh...
no.
I'm gonna go. - No, I don't want you to go.
I got to think about some stuff.
what do you got to think about, huh?
come here and talk to me.
talk to me!
about what? You want
you're going away!
you're leaving.
and I'm staying here.
and I'm so happy that you're doing it, but you're gonna have a million things to do.
no. - You got so much ahead of you.
don't talk like that. - It's true.
I'm not going to have nice things, fancy things.
it doesn't
it's never gonna happen for me. It's not in the cards for me.
I don't have to go to school, okay?
Yes, you do. - I can stay here.
no. Do you see, that's exactly what I am talking about.
then you can come with me.
to New York? - Yes.
what am I going to do in New York?
be with me?
Yeah.
I don't know.
we don't got to figure all this out tonight, ya know?
we'll finish out the summer and we'll see what happens.
you saying you want to break it off?
what I'm saying we see how it goes later on.
are you breaking up with me?
I don't see how it's gonna work.
I see...
please don't do this.
you don't mean it.
Oh hell, well if you're going to do it, why wait until the summer ends, huh?
why don't you just do it, right now?
huh?
come on.
come on. - What are you doing?
do it! Do it!
do it right now.
do it!
stop it!
Oh!
you know what? I'm gonna do it. It's over.
okay? It's over.
come here. - Don't touch me.
I hate you, I hate you.
I'm gonna go.
why don't you, why don't you just go. Get out.
leave! Go! Go!
no, no, just wait a minute. We're not really breaking up, are we?
come on.
this is just a fight we're having, and tomorrow it will be like it never happened, right?
going? - Gone.
well, she must have been devastated.
she was.
he was only trying to do the right thing.
Yeah.
but what he really should have done is just told those parents to go to hell.
just stick it where the sun don't shine.
Yeah, you're right, probably should have.
the next day, Allie woke up to find her world completely changed.
what's going on?
we're going home.
we're going now? - Mm-hmm.
no, we're not supposed to be leaving for another week.
get dressed and then come and have some breakfast, dear.
willow will pack your things.
why, I'd be happy to pack your things, Miss Allie.
I don't want you to pack my things.
I don't want you to touch my stuff. I'm not going.
Yes, you are. - No, I'm not.
Yes, Allie, you are. - No, I'm not.
Allie, you are going whether you like it or not.
now, even if Aaron has to throw you over his shoulder and drag you the whole way, you're going.
excuse me.
all right, let's go. - Come on.
we have to have all these done by lunch.
come on, get on!
you shouldn't be standing around. Here we go.
let's go. Come on.
fin!
Where's Noah?
he's out delivering a load.
what's going on? - I'm leaving town.
leaving? - Yeah.
when? - Now, right now-- like today.
look, I need you to tell Noah something, okay?
I need you to tell him that I love him.
and tell him that I'm sorry for everything, okay?
look, I was up all night with him, Allie.
I've never seen him so low.
it's over. Don't make it any harder than it already is.
No! No, it's not over.
fin, we had a fight last night.
no, we said some things we didn't mean, but it's not over.
it is over. - No.
leave it alone. Let it go.
I'm coming.
mama, I'm coming!
look, he understands. - But
it's hard, but he really does.
summer's over and it's time to go home.
if he wants to talk to you, he'll write. If not?
okay.
okay, can you just -- can you just tell him that I love him, then?
can you do that? - I'll tell him.
thank you.
Bye, Fin.
she's gone.
summer romances end for all kinds of reasons.
but when all is said and done, they have one thing in common:
they are shooting stars
a spectacular moment of light in the heavens, a fleeting glimpse of eternity.
and in a flash, they're gone.
Noah was desperate.
he wrote to Allie that he was sorry and stupid for breaking up with her.
he wrote to tell her that he still loved her, and he wanted to see her.
and that if she would write back, he would come to wherever she was.
he wrote one letter a day for a year
365 letters, but they all went unanswered.
hey Fred! Nothing?
sorry.
all right, thank you.
finally, after a year of silence, he decided to put it all behind him and start a new life.
so he wrote a farewell letter
and he and Fin packed their bags and headed for Atlanta.
Noah! Noah!
Noah!
come on, listen to this!
a state of war has existed between the United States and the...
the Constitution of the United States, against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
Noah and Fin enlisted together.
and after two years of chasing Rommel through the North African desert, they were deployed to Patton's Third Army in Europe.
go!
fin!
do I contradict myself?
very well then, I contradict myself.
Allie was in her third year of college when she volunteered as a nurse's aid.
to her, the broken men with shattered bodies, who filled the ward were all Noah.
or someone who fought beside him in the jungle or frozen snow swept road.
I'm gonna lift you up.
ready?
there we go.
now, I'm gonna bring this leg over.
set it on the stool. - All right.
you okay? - Yeah.
miss, can l ask you a question?
hmm?
I noticed that you aren't wearing a ring.
and I was wondering if I could take you out.
excuse me? - On a date.
now, before you go and say no,
I'll have you know that I am an excellent dancer and my intentions are completely dishonorable.
okay, okay "Casanova," come on.
let's just get you better, then we'll talk about a date, okay?
would you get a load of him?
Oh my gosh, he is dreamy.
what is he doing here? - Mmm.
he's staring at you.
Oh, miss?
I'm all better.
now, how's about that date?
Allie was surprised how quickly she fell in love with Lon Hammond.
he was handsome, smart, funny, sophisticated and charming.
Hey!
he also came from old Southern money, and was fabulously wealthy.
what?
Oh, what's happening?
where you going? - Where they going?
see you later, sweetheart. - Oh dear, look at that.
Allie, I've been thinking a lot about why we shouldn't get married.
okay, I give up, why shouldn't we get married?
well see, that's the thing, I couldn't think of anything at first.
an then, it just dawned on me. Your parents...
my parents? - Absolutely.
your old mom and dad. Thank you for that.
mom?
you see, the problem is that they love me.
I'm exactly the type of man - They do.
they want you to end up with. - Really?
you know, I'm wealthy, I'm from the South, I got a decent job.
you know, I'm an incredible dancer, I'm a really smart guy.
I like to think --- So what's the problem, huh?
now just this, if you marry me --- Mm-hmm.
now listen close.
if you marry me... - Mm-hmm.
then you will have lost a life long battle of defiance against them.
Oh my goodness, what are we going to do?
I do not know. - Huh!
Hey, band, you feeling all right?
◎ Hey, band, you feeling all right?! ◎
see Allie, I think -- damn it, I think you have to marry me.
I think you need to marry me. - I do?
yes you do. - I do, why?
because if you do, you parents will always know the unhappiness that you feel for not being able to disappoint them.
I think you may have overlooked one minor detail.
and what's that?
well, you see you have to get their permission first.
and I think you may have overestimated their affection for you.
is that right?
Mm-hmm. - Oh, I don't think so.
then why not?
Oh, 'cause I asked them already and they said yes.
what?
one more thing.
I love you.
will you marry me, honey?
I know I kid around a lot, but I'm crazy about you.
marry me? Make me the happiest man in the world.
Yes. Yes!
just hold tight. - Where are you going?
Oh my God. Mama.
okay, stop the band.
excuse me. I'd like everyone here to know that this young lady and I are getting married.
she agreed with all her heart, but couldn't understand why at the very moment she said yes,
Noah's face came to her mind.
Hey, Noah, yeah!
Oh, good to see you. Let me see you.
you bleeding anywhere? No?
everything good? - Yeah.
Oh, I love you.
come on, there's something I got to show you.
come on. - All right.
what's going on?
what is this?
here.
I sold the house.
you sold the house? - Yup.
gotta be out by the end of the month.
between that and your Gl Bill, you ought to be able to get it now.
get what? - Your dream house.
the Windsor Plantation. - Dad
now, don't Dad me, I don't want to hear about it.
I already talked to the bank, they're gonna give you the loan.
well, I can't let you sell your house. - It's done.
it's a good thing. You should do it.
wait a second. You sell the house, where are you gonna live?
with you, dummy, what do you think?
somebody's got to help you fix it up.
Noah took a look at the house, but only saw one thing
Allie.
he decided right there to fulfill his life-long dream.
he would rebuild the old house from the ground up.
and when Noah went to Charleston to get the building plans approved, fate stepped in and dealt him a sweet card.
stop the bus! Stop the bus.
sorry, Mac, I can't stop the bus until I get to the depot.
no, no, no, please stop the bus now. Please!
do you understand English, pal?
no one gets off till we get to the depot. Now sit down.
God. - Hey!
watch it, screwball!
what are you doing?
Hey!
how old is your daughter now?
well, you mind. - He's right over there.
baby, hello.
Oh! - Hold it.
Oh, come with it.
after seeing Allie that day, something inside Noah snapped.
he got the notion into his head that if he restored the old house
Allie would find a way to come back to him.
some called it a labor of love.
others called it something else.
but in fact, Noah had gone a little mad.
excuse me. - Would
it's time to eat.
lunch will be served in the Sun Room today.
the melon is good. I had a bite.
did they ever see each other again?
Noah and Allie?
now you don't want me to spoil the end of the story before I get to the good part, do you?
where did I leave off?
when Noah's father died in November, the house was all he had.
in time, Noah finished the house.
okay, smile. Here we go.
he took a good look at what he had accomplished, got rip-roaring drunk for 10 days, thought seriously about setting it on fire, then finally put the house up for sale.
I'm prepared to offer you this much.
he had a number of interested buyers, but he always found a reason not to sell it to them.
no.
either the bids were too low, or if they met his asking price, he felt it was worth a lot more.
it's a lot of money, but I'll take it.
50000
that's more than my asking price. - That's right.
it's a great deal more.
he told the man that offered him $5, 000 over his price that no one in his right mind would do that and he wouldn't have a lunatic living in his house.
he worked out his frustration with life on the creek every morning.
and in the evenings, to temper the sting of loneliness, there was Martha Shaw.
Martha was a war widow who lived in Quail Ridge, a town away.
so you want to go out tomorrow?
I got to work.
well, we could down to the river if you want to.
next week, sometime.
maybe we could take a drive somewhere?
no.
well, I'm just asking you.
what do you want, Noah?
what do you mean, what do I want?
from me.
sometimes when you talk to me, you don't even see me.
look, a woman knows when a man looks into her eyes and sees someone else.
now you know I want to give you all the things that you want, right?
but I can't, because they're gone...
they're broken.
all right?
is the veil too much?
are you kidding? You look perfect!
you're the most beautiful bride.
you look gorgeous, honey. - Thank you.
wait until Lon sees you in this dress, he's gonna go crazy.
he won't be able to take his eyes off you, or his hands.
Oh, you're bad!
have you seen this morning's paper?
the "Daily Journal" says that you are going to be - the social highlight of the season. - Of the season?
this is gonna be a celebration the likes of which this town's never seen!
she doesn't plan, she plots, doesn't she?
mama, look, the Governor's coming. - He better. Let me see.
Oh, boy.
all right Savannah, where are we at? - We're 82 now.
Memphis, where are at? - We're 89 now.
89, great, up from 85.
sir? - Yes.
you have a visitor.
well, hello. Baby, I didn't know you were coming.
I'm-- I'm so sorry, I should have called.
baby, what are you talking about? You don't have to call.
guys, could you give us a minute? - All right.
Yes, sir. Miss Allie.
ma'am.
so what's up?
I don't paint anymore.
I used to paint all the time.
I really loved it.
I didn't know that. - Yeah.
so paint.
I will.
I'm gonna start. - Great.
is everything okay?
I need to get away.
okay.
I need to take care of a few things.
I need to clear my head.
okay, should I be worried?
no, I don't think so. - Oh, that's reassuring.
listen, are you all right?
Yeah. - Okay, then go.
take your time, do whatever you need to do.
it's okay to be nervous, all right?
it's normal to get cold feet before your wedding.
no, no second thoughts, huh-uh.
I love you.
I'm going to be back from Seabrook in a couple of days, okay?
Seabrook? - Yeah, Seabrook.
hello.
I saw your picture in the paper, the one with you and the house.
and I just wanted to come and see if you were okay.
I mean, I wasn't in the neighborhood or anything.
I just...
so are you okay?
okay, good.
I'm a stupid woman, I shouldn't have come.
you want to come in?
okay.
this is a good story.
I'm glad you like it.
I think I've heard it before.
Yes.
perhaps more than once?
doctor needs to see you.
me? Now? - No, him.
but he hasn't finished reading his story.
I'll read some more when I'm through with the doctor.
this shouldn't take too long.
all right. - Don't you go away.
I'll be right back.
while you waiting, maybe you'd like to play the piano for a few minutes.
you do like that.
I do? - Mm-hmm.
I don't know any tunes. - You can read music.
no kidding? - Mm-hmm.
who are you?
I'm Dr. Barnwell, one of the new attending physicians.
we haven't met, so I thought I'd examine you myself.
okay, so I see here that you've had two heart attacks over the last 18 months.
Yeah, minor ones, I think one was angina.
okay, any complications? - Nope, feel fine.
okay, deep breath for me.
okay, one more time.
and deep breath.
and one more.
terrific, terrific. You still taking your medication?
every day, twice a day. - Good, good, good, good, good.
okay, you can put your shirt on.
so I understand that you read to Miss Hamilton.
Yeah, to help her remember.
hmm. - You don't think it'll help?
no, I don't.
she remembers, Doc.
I read to her and she remembers.
not always, but she remembers.
but senile dementia is irreversible.
it's degenerative.
after a certain point, its victims don't come back.
Yeah, that's what they keep telling me.
well, I just don't want you to get your hopes up.
well, thanks, Doc, but you know what they say?
science goes only so far and then comes God.
then comes God.
damn, I forgot to turn the page for her. You through with me?
I guess they flipped that page.
no, that she's playing by memory.
his name is Lon Hammond, Jr.
Hammond? As in Hammond Cotton?
as in Hammond Cotton.
well, your parents must love him.
he's a really good man, Noah. You'd really like him.
you love him?
Yeah, I do. I love him very much.
well, that's that.
you marry Lon and we can be friends...
right?
right.
are you hungry?
do you want to stay for dinner?
umm...
I have to warn you, I'm a cheap drunk.
a couple more of these and you're gonna be carrying me right out of here.
well, you go slow then, I don't want to have to take advantage of you.
you wouldn't dare. I'm a married woman.
not yet.
what?
why are you looking at me like that?
just memories.
this room.
this -- is this where we
this is the room?
huh...
I'm full. - Me too.
Oh how your fingers drowse me.
your breath falls around me like dew.
your pulse lulls the tympans of my ears.
I feel a merge from head to foot.
delicious enough.
it was real, wasn't it?
you and me.
such a long time ago, we were just a couple of kids.
but we really loved each other, didn't we?
I should go.
goodbye.
do you think you could back tomorrow morning?
there's some place I'd like to show you.
please.
okay. - Okay.
she had come back into his life
like a sudden flame, blazing and streaming into his heart.
Noah stayed up all night contemplating the certain agony he knew would be his, if he were to lose her twice.
Oh, I do wish I could figure out the end of this story.
the children are here.
children?
not yours, his. - Oh...
do you mind?
why, I'd love to meet them.
come over here.
Hi, Daddy. - Sweetheart, how are you?
Hi, Daddy. - Hi, Maggie.
Hi, I'm Allie.
Hi, I'm Mary Allen. - Mary Allen.
nice to see you. - Nice to see you.
Hi. - Hi, Maggie.
Maggie, how are you?
hello there, honey.
Hi, Davanee.
what a pretty name. - Thank you.
Oh... - Oh, how cute, thank you.
and who's this? - Edmond.
Hi, Edmond.
you know, I think I'll run on up and take my afternoon nap, all right?
come on, honey, let's go. - There you go.
all right. Good. - Thank you.
I'll read some more later.
all right, thank you.
I'm so happy to meet you all.
goodbye. - Bye, bye.
nice to meet you. - Goodbye.
Bye.
she seems good today. - She is good.
I don't know, there's something about today.
maybe it's a day for a miracle.
daddy, come home.
mama doesn't know us.
she doesn't recognize you. She'll never understand.
we miss you.
this is crazy, you living here.
Yeah, you know we'll all help with Mom. We can take shifts visiting.
look, guys, that's my sweetheart in there.
I'm not leaving her.
this is my home now.
your mother is my home.
Hello? - Hey, there.
Hi, who is this?
it's Lon, who were you expecting?
uh, nobody, l
I just -- I'm just surprised. How -- how did you find me?
well, there's only one hotel in Seabrook.
and when you didn't call, I got worried.
where you been? Are you all right?
you know, I feel like an idiot, 'cause l called your hotel about a hundred times.
I'm fine.
anything you want to tell me?
no. - No?
no.
okay.
Lon, I love you.
call you tomorrow?
okay.
Noah?
Noah!
Hey, there.
well, we better get going, the rain's coming in.
you like it? - It's spectacular.
it's like a dream.
do you want to feed them? - Yeah.
what are they all doing here?
I don't know.
they're supposed to migrate to the Guatemala sound.
they won't stay here?
no...
they'll go back where they came from.
you're different.
what do you mean?
just the way you look. Everything.
you look different too, but in a good way.
you know, you're kinda the same though.
yeah?
Yeah.
and you really did it.
what? - Everything.
the house
it's beautiful what you did.
well, I promised you I would.
great.
we got to go.
Noah!
why didn't you write me?
Why?
it wasn't over for me.
I waited for you for seven years.
and now it's too late.
I wrote you 365 letters.
I wrote you every day for a year.
you wrote me? - Yes.
you
it wasn't over.
it still isn't over.
Oh...
you got to be kidding me.
all this time, that's what I'd been missing?
let's do it again.
Noah.
Noah.
wake up.
wake up. - Um-mmm.
Hi. - You're trying to kill me, woman.
Huh-uh. - Mm-hmm.
I need rest.
I need food so I can regain my strength.
okay, what do you want?
umm... umm...
some pancakes.
okay.
and bacon.
okay. - And some chicken.
she's the one, isn't she?
can I meet her?
I'd really like to meet her.
I don't know if that's a good idea, Martha.
so this is Martha?
Hi, I'm Allie.
I've heard a lot about you.
I've heard a lot about you, too.
you want to come in?
are you sure?
Yeah, yeah, Noah's just saying how hungry he was.
and, you know, you could put on a pot of tea.
come on in.
come on in.
it was nice meeting you, Martha.
nice meeting you too. - Goodbye.
take care.
she's sensational. She really is.
I'm really glad that I came, Noah.
I'd forgotten what it's like.
for the first time since I lost Richard,
I feel like I've got something to look forward to.
Mmm...
Lon is on his way here.
I'm afraid your father spilled the beans about Noah, and when Lon didn't hear from you again last night, he decided to come.
well, that's great. That's just terrific.
you, me, Noah and Lon, one big happy family.
tell me about the letters, Mother.
is it true? - Yes.
you watched me cry myself to sleep for months and months and you never said anything.
how could you do that? - I'm sorry.
you're sorry? You're sorry? - Yes, I am -- I am sorry.
because of you, my entire life is ruined!
okay, yes, I stole your letters.
it was wrong, but stop being dramatic and at least take some of the responsibility.
you came down here. You knew what you were doing.
you knew this would happen.
Oh, so now I'm a tramp?
you are unbelievable.
unbelievable.
go on and get some clothes on.
let's take a drive.
let's take a drive? Why would I want to go anywhere with you?
because I might know you a little better than you think.
and I don't want you waking up one morning thinking that if you'd known everything, you might have done something different.
what are we doing here, Mama?
do you see that man, there?
Mm-hmm.
don't look like it now, but 25 years ago
Oh my goodness, he was really something.
we were out of our minds in love, let me tell you.
Wow.
well, naturally, your grandfather was furious, so...
we decided to run away.
we didn't even make the next town before the police picked us up.
but that was then.
you know sometimes when I'm in the area,
I just stop here and I watch him, trying to picture how different my life might have been.
I want you to know that I love your father.
mama, I'm --- No, goddamn it, this is important and you need to hear it. I do.
he is a wonderful man.
he is good to me and I don't deserve him.
I love him, Allie, I do, I love him.
I know.
Oh, God.
Oh, this is just very embarrassing.
Oh, I'm a stupid woman.
look at me, the big old bawl-bag.
it's crazy.
I don't even know who that person is.
Oh, boy.
okay.
Allie!
here.
I hope you make the right choice.
interesting morning?
Yeah.
Lon's here in town.
he's here?
Yeah, we saw his car on the way, at the hotel.
huh.
I see you got my letters.
finally.
what are you going to do, Allie?
I don't know.
we're back to that?
are we back there?
what about the past couple of days? They happened, you know?
I know that they happened, and they were wonderful, but they were also very irresponsible.
I have a fiance waiting for me at a hotel, who's going to be crushed - when he finds out. - So you make love to me and then you go back to your husband?
was that your plan?
was that a test that I didn't pass?!
no, I made a promise to a man, he gave me a ring and I gave him my word.
and your word is shot to hell now, - don't you think? - I don't-- I don't know.
I'll find out when I talk to him.
this is not about keeping your promise, and it's not about following your heart, it's about security.
what is that supposed to mean? - Money!
what are you ta-- - He's got a lot of money.
now I hate you, you smug bastard. - Well, I hate you.
if you leave here, I hate you. - You would
hate you if you leave here. - Have you been paying attention to anything that's happening?
I guess not. I think I must have misread - all of those signals. - I guess you did.
you're bored. You're bored and you know it.
you wouldn't be here if there wasn't something missing.
you arrogant son of a bitch!
would you just stay with me?
stay with you? What for?
look at us, we're already fighting. - Well, that's what we do.
we fight.
you tell me when I'm being an arrogant son of a bitch and I tell you when you're being a pain in the ass.
which you are 99% of the time.
I'm not afraid to hurt your feelings.
they have like a two second rebound rate and you're back doing the next pain-in-the-ass thing.
so, what?
so it's not gonna be easy. It's gonna be really hard.
and we're gonna have to work at this every day, but I want to do that, because I want you.
I want all of you, forever, you and me, every day.
will you do something for me?
please? Will you just picture your life for me?
30 years from now, 40 years from now, what's it look like?
if it's with that guy, go! Go!
I lost you once, I think I could do it again, if I thought it's what you really wanted.
but don't you take the easy way out.
what easy way? There is no easy way, no matter what I do, somebody gets hurt.
would you stop thinking about what everyone wants.
stop thinking about what I want, what he wants, what your parents want. What do you want?
what do you want? - It's not that simple.
what do you want? - It's not
goddamn it, what do you want?
I have to go.
my dearest Allie,
I couldn't sleep last night because I know that it's over between us.
I'm not bitter anymore, because I know that what we had was real.
and if in some distant place in the future we see each other in our new lives,
I'll smile at you with joy and remember how we spent a summer beneath the trees
learning from each other and growing in love.
the best love is the kind that awakens the soul and makes us reach for more, that plants a fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds.
and that's what you've given me.
that's what I'd hoped to give to you forever.
I love you. I'll be seeing you, Noah.
it's beautiful. It's a beautiful story.
Yes, it is.
I don't know why, but it makes me feel sad.
I know you feel lost right now, but don't worry, nothing is ever lost, nor can be lost.
the body sluggish, aged, cold, the embers left from earlier fires.
shall duly flame again.
did you write that?
no, that was Walt Whitman.
I think I knew him.
I think you did.
shall we go in? I'm feeling a little chilly.
okay.
thank you.
well, who did all of this?
I did, with a little help from my friends on the nursing staff.
Oh...
I've never seen anything so beautiful.
neither have l.
shall we?
some grape juice? - I'd love it.
Ah, so many pills. How sick are you?
the sickness has become a relative term for me.
I think of it now as more a general wearing out process.
to you.
so what happened?
in the story, which one did she choose?
okay, the way I see it, I got three choices.
one, I can shoot him.
two, I can kick the crap out of him.
or three... I leave you.
well, all that's no good.
you see, 'cause...
none of those options get me you.
and in spite of everything,
I love you.
I love you too.
I meant what I said when I gave you that ring.
I did too.
I did too. It's just that when I'm
when I'm with Noah I feel like one person and when I'm with you I feel like someone totally different.
look, it's normal not to forget your first love.
I love you, Allie, but I want you for myself.
I don't want to have to convince my fiance that she should be with me.
you don't have to.
I already know I should be with you.
and they lived happily ever after.
who? Who did?
Oh yes, of course.
I remember now.
it was us.
it was us. It was us. - Oh, my darling.
Oh my sweetheart.
I love you so much.
Oh, my baby.
Noah, Noah.
I love you, Angel.
what happened to me? - Nothing.
you just went away for a little while.
how much time do we have? - I'm not sure.
last time it was no more than five minutes.
okay.
Hey, I brought along an old friend.
◎ I'll be seeing you ◎
◎ In all the old familiar places ◎
◎ That this heart of mine embraces ◎
◎ All day through ◎
◎ In that small cafe... ◎
how are the children? - Oh, they're fine.

Mm-hmm.

Oh yes, it does.

remember that story you were reading to me?
why, yes.
do you think that I could be her tonight?
would that be all right?
you know what we could do?
maybe we could get a car and we could go for a ride.
why could get out of here and just go someplace, you want to?
I don't think so. Not tonight, darling.
come on, why not?
wait a minute...
why did you call me darling? I don't know you.
what's going on here? Am I supposed to know you?
Allie... Allie, sweetheart. - No, no, no!
Hey, Allie, I love you, stay with me, don't leave
No!
who are you? - I'm Noah, I'm Noah and you're Allie.
what do you want? What are you doing here?
come on, baby. - Don't come near me!
don't you come near me! - Allie -- Allie, l
help! Help!
help me! - Calm down, Allie, calm down.
no, no, not you!

talk to me.
somebody help me! - Calm down!
give her two cc's. - No! No!
calm down, Allie.
calm down, Allie, yes. - One, two...

Allie, it's all right. It's all right. - Okay, okay, okay.
okay, now take a look.
let's take a look. One -- oh, she's fine.
good. Just breathe. - She's fine. She's fine.
stay calm, just breathe in and out, come on.

relax. - Allie?
you're fine, honey.

how do you feel? - Fine. Fit as a fiddle.
where you going? - I was just taking a walk.
I can't sleep.
well, you know you're not supposed to, it's against the rules.
Yeah, I know.
you weren't really going for a walk, were you?
you were going to see Miss Allie.
I just got out of the hospital and I miss her.
Mr. Calhoun,
I'm sorry, but I can't let you see her tonight.
now you're gonna have to go back to your room.
as for me,
I'm gonna go downstairs and get myself a cup of coffee.
I won't be back to check on you for a while, so don't do anything foolish.
Hi.
Noah.
Noah.
Hi, sweetheart.
I'm sorry I haven't been able to be here to read to you.
I didn't know what to do.
I was afraid you were never coming back.
I'll always come back.
what's gonna happen when I can't remember anything any more?
what will you do?
I'll be here.
I'll never leave you.
I need to ask you something.
what is it, sweetheart?
do you think that our love can create miracles?
Yes, I do.
that's what brings you back to me each time.
do you think our love could take us away together?
I think our love can do anything we want it to.
I love you.
I love you, Allie.
good night.
good night.
I'll be seeing you.
he's leaning forward, indicating all focus is on her.
see how her palms are facing up?
that means that she's open to what he's communicating.

I'll get him home safe.
all right, so they're into each other.
you know what? I'm actually happy for them.
and you don't feel weird about Marissa?
cause even I feel a little weird about Marissa for you.
no. I'd feel weird about Marissa if I saw Marissa.
I thought she was staying at your house now that your parents are hooking up on the high seas.
no, she's been sleeping at the trailer.
this breakup has hit her hard.
she said she needs time to process her feelings and heal in solitude.

Yeah.
huh. Synapses are really firing, huh?
I think I have a bit of a head cold.
well, as long as you don't have any other infectious diseases.
what? Hmm?
hang on.
Hey.
Hi, Mom.
Hello?
Hey, how's my girl?
Hey, Daddy.
so, we're back from our trip.

Hey, what's up, man?
someone's in a chipper mood this morning.
Yeah, well, you know,
I had a really good time last night.
I like that place - the, uh, Bait Shop.
we should hang out there more often.
Really?
Yeah! Uh, maybe, uh, maybe tonight.
you know, Sadie likes the deejay.
she, uh, she kind of wants to get me on the dance floor.
no.
well, you'- you're the one who's always telling me to loosen up, you know, go out more.
tense, tightly wound, shut in.
that's all I want out of you.
okay? It's kind of a Boo Radley shape, far away from the Bait Shop and all its unsavory characters.
Hey, Sandy, what's going on?
whoa, good mood, huh?
Yeah, well, uh...
things must be working out with this girl.
dad, Ryan just smiled.
well, she seems great.
everything okay with you?
Yep, just work. Not to worry.
yeah? Well, uh, listen, fellas, love to chat
got to get over to Sadie's.
got a few minutes before school, but, um... cheer up, okay?
Hey, handsome men.
where?
Aw, I just made the same joke as my dad.
that's a bad sign.
your father happens to be hilarious.
it's just harder to tell these days.
well, then it's a good thing that we have a date tonight.
what?
romantic dinner by the water, followed by an even more romantic walk on the beach, followed by... SETH Nothing.
followed by nothing.
you will walk and you will eat.
Oh, geez, I'm afraid I... I can't even do that.
you're canceling?
postponing.
I want to be in the right frame of mind to eat... and walk with you.
I'm sorry.
something's wrong?
it'll all be fine.
so, Dad's been working a lot lately, huh?
look, I'll be your date.
we haven't gotten a chance to hang out in a while.
Wow. I thought you forgot you had a mother.
Hey, lay off the guilt. I said I'm in.
I just get to pick the movie.
so, we're a couple thousand feet short of a McMansion, but hopefully someone will take it.
Yeah, well, with that sales pitch, who could resist?
are you saying you find me irresistible?
mm, paint smell, realtor on the way over
that's romantic and all, but...
Yeah, I guess I should probably get to school, too.
okay.
no, no, wait. No.
we will pick this up tonight?
mm, yeah.
I'll give u a tour of the pool house.
Yeah, we'll see if you can close the deal.
got to go.
you didn't mention a word to Ryan?
spoil his good mood?
he practically skipped out of the kitchen.
Atwood skipping?
now, there's a disturbing and odd visual.
well, picture this one: Ryan dancing.
that's what this woman does to him, and if we want to keep this skip in his step, we've got to kee Volchok off his radar.
Aw! You play.
Volchok is Atwood's kryptonite.
he'll totally hulk out.
you're mixing comic book metapho.
but you think we can keep Marissa quiet?
Marissa? She can barely put her words together these days.
She'usually such a wordsmith.
what does she see in that guy?
he's so dirty and greasy.
he's got good abs.
women like abs.
got a six-pack myself; I know.
Oh, Cohen, those are your ribs.
Oh. Well, listen, let's just not tell anybody anything.
all right, heads down, lips sealed, smooth sailing.
he's also got really defined triceps.
I like that.
well, I'm going to get right to it.
I talked to Griffin.
you're firing me?
yes... I'm firing you.
I have no choice.
it's for the good of the hospital.
what kind of garbage excuse is that?
the truthful kind.
Yeah, when it's convenient for you.
Yoknow, every time that you need to do something that makes you feel bad, you're doing it for the hospital.
it's either you... or the hospital.
Griffin will not move forward unless you're gone.
you don't even see what's happening.
he's making me the fall guy.
there's no need to peddle in conspiracy theories here, Matt.
you are no angel.
neither Griffin.
he's been taking kickbacks from vendors for years.
I like to know who I'm gettg into business with.
those are some bold accusations.
I can back them up, and I'll be happy to share everything I know about him and you to whoever will listen.
thanks for the heads-up.
now I know I'm doing the right thing.
you think things have been complicated?
you haven't seen anything yet...
boss.
a little champagne won't hurt you girls.
it is a toast.
how often do we get engaged?
don't answer that.
engaged?
you guys are engaged?
I'm so happy for you.
thank you, baby.
Really? You are? Yeah.
I mean, you may be Mrs. Cooper- Nichol-Cooper-Roberts, but if you make my dad happy...
she does. I.
then I'm happy.
Marissa, how about some champagne?
sure.
Marissa, do you have anything to add?
Oh. One second.
Hey. Yeah.
you are?
okay, bye.
Congrats.
will you excuse me for a moment?
I'm...
where do you think you're going, young lady?
I got to go, Mom.
my friend called, and he says he needs me.
I need you.
I don't have to tell you how important this night is for our family.
Yeah, well, don't worry, Mom.
I'm not going to screw up your golden ticket.
I don't know if I'm a fan of Yakuza films.
it was an interesting movie, but a fun night.
Yeah. I would say anytime you get to watch a guy rip off his own arm to connue fighting, that's a really good night.
I just didn't understand the other fellow.
what, the guy that produced the ball of energy from hishest anthen destroyed the world?
I think it's pretty self-explanatory.
you remember when I took you to Fantasia?
cause I do.
I'm sorry you didn't like the movie.
Ah, it was worth it to spd some time with you.
I missed you.
well, do you want to do it again? Do you want a second date?
Yeah, but I get to pick the activity.
sure. Tomorrow night?
I have an idea already.
Hey.
we have a major problem.
marissa just bailed on our parents' engagement party to skank out with the surf Nazi.
your dad and Julie got engaged?
you kind of buried the lead there, Summer.
Julie and Dr. Roberts?
we've got bigger fish here, Cohen.
marissa is on a slut spiral, and we need to stop her.
that's a little out of my league.
I know; we need Ryan.
the code of silence has beenifted.
I'll talk to him...
but he's been in such a good mood.
so this is the pool house?
interested in making an offer?
uh, it's a little small, but it's got great views.
what? Locked?
when did this door get a lock on it?
little busy, Seth.
Yeah, you're not the only one.
listen, I didn't want to have to tell you this through the door, but Marissa's been hooking up with Volchok.
Oh, hey.
Oh. Hey.
Sadie, I didn't realize...
Yeah. Good night, Seth.
night. Call me, okay?
Yeah.
I guess I ruined the mood, huh?
just a lot.
you know, when I put the locks on,
I thought I solved the problem.
well, you know me.
when I have important informion to disseminate, nothing can stop me, not walls, not locks...
not women.
so what are you going to do?
reschedule with Sadie, and go back to her place.
no, I meant about Marissa.
what do you mean, what am I going to do?
well, Summer seems to think this Volchok guy is not exactly a beacon of morality.
eh, not my problem, not my girlfriend.
well, I know.
uh, two coffees.
look, man, she makes her own choices; so do I.
I choose Sadie's tonight.
so Zen these days.
it's simultaneously inspiring and disconcerting.
Ah, just feeling good, man, just feeling good.
Cheers.
I can't lieve you're getting married... again.
you make it seem like an everyday occurrence.
it almost is.
this time, it's going to stick.
it just feels real.
not everyone can have that Kirsten and Sandy relationship, that bionic, Kevlar-wrapped robo-marriage that can withstand anything you throw at it.
well, you've seemed happier than I've seen you in a long time.
Mm. Neil has mellowed me.
no more manipulative bitch, no more scheming, no more double-crossing, which will be a disappointment to some.
not for Dr. Robert
you know, we both just kind of found each other right at the moment when we really needed someone.
there's no agenda.
he does have a palatial estate.
if he wanted to live together in this trailer, I'd do it.
not that I'm offering.
real classy, Gus.
it's them BiGulps.
they go right through me.
sneak up on me, too.
that's a nice final image.
what's going on?
Oh, my God.
you the new tent?
nice to meet you.
we really need to get you out of here.
Hi.
Hi. What's up?
missed you in class.
Yeah, there was traffic.
we had that test today.
that was today?
Thanks.
got to go.
totally and completely untrue, and if Matt ever tried to print that, I will sue him for libel.
he seemed pretty sure of himself.
if it wasn't for me, your firm would be belly-up right now, which is why I don't appreciate your accusing me.
I'm not accusing anybody of anything.
forgive me for saying, Henry, but...
you seem a touch defensive.
the only business that I am in is the business of helping people.
I would like to believe that we are partners in that.
you give me your word,
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.
sandy, I didn't become a doctor to get rich.
you have my word.
thank you.
you did a wonderful job.
thank you.
Bye.
wee!
Hola, Mima.
I'm from the Philippines.
Oh, well, then.
wow, Coop.
you make a really good hood ornament.
funny.
I know.
Oh, you're getting drunk.
more like staying drunk.
Oh, good plan.
I can't deal with this right now.
well, you're going to have to, 'cause now, Coop, we're sisters.
right, which means, you're not my mom. You're right.
I know about Volchok.
I saw you mauling him at the Bait Shop.
I know you're shacking up with him at the trailer park.
Wow. Well, aren't you a regular Veronica Mars?
way to solve this week's mystery.
what has gotten into you?
since I know who has.
what do you care?
you have Seth and Ryan's got his new girlfriend.
Johnny's gone.
what difference does it make what I do?
I'm not hurting anyone.
Oh. You're just the saddest girl in the whole world.
grow up.
get over yourself.
take a shower.
fine. Why don't you take your little emo boyfriend, drive off in your Beamer, and go home to Daddy's mansion?
Oh, yeah, why don't you go with Volchok to one of his heavy metal vomit parties, and, like, listen to heavy metal and, like, vomit?!
Wow. You're being so lame. Not as lame as you.
fine. Bye. Later.
what are you doing?
taking what's mine.
you were supposed to turn over your key.
you're trespassing.
these are my personal files, which your office conveniently forgot to send.
I'm taking them.
no, you're not.
what are you gonna do? Arrest me, Sandy?
you gonna fight me?
you're acting like you got something to hide.
you're acting like a child.
if you're so sure that I don't have a case, then you shouldn't care if I leave with this box.
are you threatening me?
doesn't seem like I have a choice.
game on, Sandy.
wow, this is so romantic... and original.
Yeah, well, what can I say?
creature of habit.
Yes, yes, the lure of the chi fry.
a natural aphrodisiac.
Yeah, well, I think we'll be fine as long as Seth is nowhere nearby.
Seth, right.
well, good, good'cause I have something to tell you.
I have some good news.
yeah? Hey, you see that chick Volchok's with?
Aw, she ain't innocent.
Volchok show you the scratches on his back?
why don't we take this to go?
no, no, it's fine. Let's just go, come.
Sadie, it's fine- Sadie.
I'm not mad.
I just feel like, once again, you know, the mood was kind of ruined.
all right, well, okay, we can turn it around.
I think we're trying too rd.
maybe we need to let the perfect night just happen.
okay?
give it some time.
all right, fine.
let me at least drive you home.
okay.
just give me a second.
Ryan, don't.
Hey, look, it's little bitch.
Volchok around?
Why? You looking for your girlfriend?
no, actually I'm looking for him.
and if you see him, tell him that, and to meet me under the pier tomorrow morning.
you think you can remember all that?
you need me to write it down for you?
Yeah, bro, we'll tell him.
you know, I just knew.
I knew it was only a matter of time until you got in my face again.
just want to talk. About what?
your new girlfriend or mine?
cause, you know I got stories about both of them.
bet you do.
this where you tell me
I better leave her alone, that she's too good for me.
whoever Marissa wants to be with, it's not my place to jud.
saw her at school, she didn't look so good.
well, that girl couldn't look bad if she tried.
she was drinking; u know she's a problem with that, right?
she drinks, she gets drunk.
I don't see the problem.
just so you know, I'not looking after her anymore.
it's on you now.
treat her right.
she deserves it.
good morning, ladies.
I'd say a great morning.
we're a new family.
first breakfast together.
and tonight, we're going to have our first family dinner
something that hopefully will become a weekly tradition.
nothing like all sitting down together to a good meal.
discussing current events, catching up on each other's lives- doesn't that sound fun?
tons of.
I know Marissa has several events that she would lov to share with the family.
summer, maybe you can make that pineapple dessert I like, the one with e graham cracker things.
Oh, I'm sure Daddy's little girl would love to.
excuse me.
sisters.
Hey, man, I was looking for Sadie.
Hey. Yeah, she's in the shower.
or was.
Ryan, did you meet Bob?
Hey, Bob.
what's up?
garage door sticks a little.
cool.
make yourself at home. Thank you.
Yeah.
one bad date and I'm already replaced, huh?
all right, two bad dates.
he just bought the house.
he lives next door, and he made a really great offer.
that was my news last nghit, if you would have listened.
I know, I'm sorry. I was distracted.
you want to tell me what's up?
sure, um...
it's Volchok and Marissa.
but it's all good now.
there was a conversation I needed to have,
I had it, I'm done.
that's good.
it's just, I think I'm done, too.
what do you mean?
well, my aunt's business is handled.
the house is sold.
there's nd of no reason for me to be here.
there's no reason?
Ryan, I never intended to stay this long.
I was thinking it might be easier for me to leave, if...
if we didn't happen.
have you thought about this?
Yeah, I have.
have you?
Yeah.
I mean, if I stayed, I'd have to find an apartment, and then what?
wait for you to finish high school, follow you to college?
we're getting a little ahead of ourselves.
I honestly didn't think that much about the future.
I, uh...
was just hoping to take you to dinner.
you eat, right?
you haven't thought about it, because you're not ready to think about it, which I totally get.
but I can't change my whole life to be with someone who's distracted.
so that's it then.
no more smiling, no skipping, no more dancing.
you were never a fan of the dancing.
I don't know; might have come around.
now we'll never know.
Yeah, I can't just ask her to move here, change her whole life.
well, relocating to Newport might not be that big a deal.
put a lot of pressure on us, you know, on the relationship.
Ryan Atwood loves pressure.
he's not comfortable unless his entire body is being squeezed in a vice grip.
that is not true.
yeah?
you moved to China to help girl pregnant with a baby that might not even be yours.
Theresa needed someone.
stayed with Marissa for several years of tortured torture.
she was there for me, too.
but when it comes to pursuing your own happiness with a great girl who seems to be relatively issue-free...
I got to ask her to stay.
Yes, you do.
all right.
I saw that smile.
smiler.
I told you, Sandy, the kid's just posturing.
he's trying to get a rise out of you.
well, Matt said he has documents
he said he could prove what he's saying.
look, Sandy, I apologize.
now, what are you saying?
I'm saying, I've already let you shoulder too much of the responsibility on this situation.
now I'll handle it from here.
well, that sounds a little ominous.
what are you going to do?
you focus on the hospital.
there's a lot of people counting on you, and there's a lot of work to be done.
you've done too much already.
what was that you were saying about 18 holes at Big Canyon?
you're wearing that to a family dinner?
who says I'm going to dinner?
okay, Marissa, be mad at me if you want, but it is our family.
whatever
Hey, what's up?
the slut is still spiraling.
I thought I told you to talk to Ryan.
I did; I tried to activate his savior complex but it seems he's been cured.
Hey, I got to go; I'm hanging with my mom.
you're hanging with your mom?
I know, it seems a little weird.
but we thought we'd try something new.
so I'll talk to you later.
fine.
okay, bye.
all right?
Yeah. Where we going?
cardio bar? New Pilates?
something new.
let's give Marissa a few more minutes, shall we?
actually, I think we should just get started.
personally, I'm starving.
why don't we jus dig in and bon
what were we gonna do at this dinner?
discuss current events?
I think we live in a very fascinating time.
riveting.
Julie, why don't you ring her on her cell, see where she is?
I did call, several times.
well, I'm just a little concerned, you know.
she never missed dinner when she was staying here last semester.
that's because I wasn't here.
Neil, Maria and I haven't always had the greatest...
luck.
but you've always stood by each other through hard times.
isn't that great, Dad?
Yes, it is.
you Cooper girls are really something.
thank you, Neil.
and thank you, Summer.
will you pass the potatoes, please?
thought you and your mom fought all the time.
it's not my mom.
it's Summer.
you know, the only other time we really fought was in the fifth grade, when I sat in the back of the bus with Luke on the way to the Museum of Tolerance.
who's Luke?
summer and Luke were engaged...
in the second grade.
she doesn't like to talk about it.
why all the questions all of a sudden?
what do you mean?
you just seem very interested in my life.
I just, um...
we're hanging out.
seems like...
what?
um... you deserve to be treated rit.
if I wanted to be tread right, I wouldn't be with you.
works for me.
you want to bump?
I don't...
I mean... I've never.
there's a first time for everything.
guess I'm partying solo.
okay, what is this place?
you'll see.
crappy rec center basement, dark coffee?
I don't think you're into Weight Watchers, so either you're the lead in a communi theater group or have converted to an extremely underfunded religion.
Hi, I'm Ellen.
and I'm an alcoholic.
Hi, Ellen.
we will begin this evening with our reading of chapter five.
I thought if you knew, you wouldn't have come.
well, good instinct.
like going through this the first time wasn't painful enough.
this place has saved my family, my marriage, quite possibly my life.
these people know more about me than my own family.
well, whose fault is that?
it's not like you ever talk about what happened.
it's not like you ever ask.
and if this is how you act when I share it with you...
there's sharing and then there's lying.
well, we're here, and I'm not leaving.
so you can wait in the car, or you can do this for me.
just give me an hour.
it's important that you be here tonight.
is anyone gonna rip off their own arm and keep fighting?
metaphorically speaking, yeah.
Matt, this is Mitchell Kiven from the Register.
I got your message,
I'm extremely interested in talking about the Griffin story.
you've got the number.
Hey, Matt, it's Sandy.
we need to talk.
will you call me back as soon as you can?
look, it's cool, you guys take whatever you want.
I don't care. This isn't a robbery.
he Hey.
is, uh, Sadie around?
uh, no, actually, she, uh...
do you mind if I come in and wait?
well, I mean, it might be a while.
you just missed her.
she left for Oregon a couple hours ago.
I'm sorry.
Hey.
Hi.
what are you doing here?
sorry, I figured you were spending your time under the pier these days.
uh... I can go.
no, it's fine, I'm... I'm not going to stay.
Where's Sadie?
gone.
back to Oregon.
went over to see her, she'd already left.
without saying good-bye?
guess she thought it was easier this way.
and is it?
you know, you don't have to answer that.
I'm gonna go.
but, um...
enjoy, then.
I'll leave it as I found it.
I'd pissed in the streets, eaten out of garbage, and accidentally shot my wife- not once, but twice.
thank you very much.
that's a heartwarming tale.
he's been sober 30 years.
thank you for that, George.
before we leave, we have a couple of chips to hand out.
Kirsten, if you'd like to join me.
excuse me.
Congratulations.
you're nine months sober.
Oh, thank you.
all of you.
and, uh... especially my son, Seth, who's here with me tonight.
Hi, Seth.
Hey.
he doesn't know this, but...
he's the reason that I got sober.
the look on his face at my intervention...
he was so disappointed in me.
but he believed that I could do this...
and he was right.
congratulations, Mom.
only 29 years and three months more to go until you're as normal as William S. Burroughs over there.
never expected to see you here.
Yeah, well, I'm just glad I found you.
apparently, there's a lot of ways to leave Newport
bus, plane, etc.
Greyhound.
way to hedge your bets.
I'm just glad you're still here.
Why?
because I don't think you should leave.
Ryan really cares about you.
he told you that?
well, I mean, he didn't have to.
after everything we've been through,
I think I know him pretty well.
Yeah, well, this is my bus.
he wants you to stay.
he didn't try to stop me.
Yeah, he did, he was just a couple minutes too late.
why are you doing this?
well, I guess because you make Ryan happy.
Neil, dinner was amazing.
Yeah, Marissa's going to be sorry she missed it.
well, we have years of family dinners ahead of us.
Julie, you know this engagement is a trial, right?
what?
trial.
for you, me.
us together.
for the girls.
I mean, if our families aren't a good fit, then we really... shouldn't get married.
of course.
I mean...
love doesn't really conquer all.
and we both have the broken marriages to prove that.
but, Neil, surely this time...
sweetheart, I don't mean that in a punitive way,
I'm just trying to be practical.
I've got some reading to do.
I'll see you in minute.
Hey, baby. Oop!
good night, Dad. Good night.
I couldn't help overhearing...
what my dad just said.
but don't worry, cause he always gets this way as soon as he starts to get close to someone.
actually, Summer, the only thing I'm worried about is my daughter.
Yeah, me, too.
Hey, vodka on the rocks, please.
you got ID?
look, I drink here all the time.
Yeah, when Volchok's guys are buying.
can't you just make an exception this one time?
I used to date the manager.
sorry.
look, I'm having a bad night, and I really need a drink.
you and me both.
Oh, my God.
what happened?
like you don't know.
what are you doing here?
you tell me.
there's another bus in an hour.
what do I have to do to get you to stay?
I think you're doing.
glad to see you came back.
I wasn't sure if I should, uh...
no more talking.
here, let me help you with that.
he's leaning forward, indicating all focus is on her.
see how her palms are facing up?
that means that she's open to what he's communicating.
star Magazine
what Stars' Body Language is Really Saying.
well, I've talked to the guy, and what Ryan is really saying is he and Sadie are just taking it slow.
Oh, no, bodies don't lie.
I'm sounding out a hot new couple alert.
act like you kw nothing. I don't.
Hey, so, uh, I think we're going to head out.
all right, we'll go with you.
no, no, no, it's fine; just, uh, stay here.
I'll get him home safe.
all right, so they're into each other.
you know what? I'm actually happy for them.
and you don't feel weird about Marissa?
cause even I feel a little weird about Marissa for you.
no. I'd feel weird about Marissa if I saw Marissa.
I thought she was staying at your house now that your parents are hooking up on the high seas.
no, she's been sleeping at the trailer.
this breakup has hit her hard.
she said she needs time to process her feelings and heal in solitude.
or party with 200 sweaty teens.
what?
Oh, my god
so, if the body doesn't lie...
then it's saying "Ew."
"EW" r "Touch my pooper"?
the O. C.
coop, it's me, your best friend
you know, the one that you tell everything to?
Oh, damn, my head.
Oh, what time is it?
I know it's not big in there. My voice travels.
okay, you got to hide.
what
you live in a trailer.
I'm coming, Sum. Here, take these and this.
go.
coop! My hand doesn't remotely hurt.
Hey.
Hi. Looking good, Coop.
what very Kate Moss pre-Vanity Fair cover.
what you doing?
uh, you know, nothing.
hmm. Did you have a good time last night?
Yeah.
huh. Synapses are really firing, huh?
I think I have a bit of a head cold.
well, as long as you don't have any other infectious diseases.
what? Hmm?
hang on.
Hey.
Hi, Mom.
Hello?
Hey, how's my girl?
Hey, Daddy.
so, we're back from our trip.
did you guys have a good time?
it was wonderful.
can you have dinner with us tonight?
um, fine. Uh, what time?
don't sound so excited.
uh, eightish.
Yeah, perfect. Bye.
okay, bye.
my dad. My mom.
dinner? 8: 00.
why don't you go get dressed, and I'll drive you to school, and, um, we can talk about that and other stuff?
okay, uh, give me a minute.
I think you're going to need a little bit more than that.
mm, come here.
it's cherry.
look, you got to go.
it's wake-and-bake, baby.
always cures a hangover.
Hey, what's up, man?
someone's in a chipper mood this morning.
Yeah, well, you know,
I had a really good time last night.
I like that place - the, uh, Bait Shop.
we should hang out there more often.
Really?
Yeah! Uh, maybe, uh, maybe tonight.
you know, Sadie likes the deejay.
she, uh, she kind of wants to get me on the dance floor.
no.
well, you'- you're the one who's always telling me to loosen up, you know, go out more.
tense, tightly wound, shut in.
that's all I want out of you.
okay? It's kind of a Boo Radley shape, far away from the Bait Shop and all its unsavory characters.
Hey, Sandy, what's going on?
whoa, good mood, huh?
Yeah, well, uh...
things must be working out with this girl.
dad, Ryan just smiled.
well, she seems great.
everything okay with you?
Yep, just work. Not to worry.
yeah? Well, uh, listen, fellas, love to chat
got to get over to Sadie's.
got a few minutes before school, but, um... cheer up, okay?
Hey, handsome men.
where?
Aw, I just made the same joke as my dad.
that's a bad sign.
your father happens to be hilarious.
it's just harder to tell these days.
well, then it's a good thing that we have a date tonight.
what?
romantic dinner by the water, followed by an even more romantic walk on the beach, followed by... SETH Nothing.
followed by nothing.
you will walk and you will eat.
Oh, geez, I'm afraid I... I can't even do that.
you're canceling?
postponing.
I want to be in the right frame of mind to eat... and walk with you.
I'm sorry.
something's wrong?
it'll all be fine.
so, Dad's been working a lot lately, huh?
look, I'll be your date.
we haven't gotten a chance to hang out in a while.
Wow. I thought you forgot you had a mother.
Hey, lay off the guilt. I said I'm in.
I just get to pick the movie.
so, we're a couple thousand feet short of a McMansion, but hopefully someone will take it.
Yeah, well, with that sales pitch, who could resist?
are you saying you find me irresistible?
mm, paint smell, realtor on the way over
that's romantic and all, but...
Yeah, I guess I should probably get to school, too.
okay.
no, no, wait. No.
we will pick this up tonight?
mm, yeah.
I'll give u a tour of the pool house.
Yeah, we'll see if you can close the deal.
got to go.
you didn't mention a word to Ryan?
spoil his good mood?
he practically skipped out of the kitchen.
Atwood skipping?
now, there's a disturbing and odd visual.
well, picture this one: Ryan dancing.
that's what this woman does to him, and if we want to keep this skip in his step, we've got to kee Volchok off his radar.
Aw! You play.
Volchok is Atwood's kryptonite.
he'll totally hulk out.
you're mixing comic book metapho.
but you think we can keep Marissa quiet?
Marissa? She can barely put her words together these days.
She'usually such a wordsmith.
what does she see in that guy?
he's so dirty and greasy.
he's got good abs.
women like abs.
got a six-pack myself; I know.
Oh, Cohen, those are your ribs.
Oh. Well, listen, let's just not tell anybody anything.
all right, heads down, lips sealed, smooth sailing.
he's also got really defined triceps.
I like that.
well, I'm going to get right to it.
I talked to Griffin.
you're firing me?
yes... I'm firing you.
I have no choice.
it's for the good of the hospital.
what kind of garbage excuse is that?
the truthful kind.
Yeah, when it's convenient for you.
Yoknow, every time that you need to do something that makes you feel bad, you're doing it for the hospital.
it's either you... or the hospital.
Griffin will not move forward unless you're gone.
you don't even see what's happening.
he's making me the fall guy.
there's no need to peddle in conspiracy theories here, Matt.
you are no angel.
neither Griffin.
he's been taking kickbacks from vendors for years.
I like to know who I'm gettg into business with.
those are some bold accusations.
I can back them up, and I'll be happy to share everything I know about him and you to whoever will listen.
thanks for the heads-up.
now I know I'm doing the right thing.
you think things have been complicated?
you haven't seen anything yet...
boss.
a little champagne won't hurt you girls.
it is a toast.
how often do we get engaged?
don't answer that.
engaged?
you guys are engaged?
I'm so happy for you.
thank you, baby.
Really? You are? Yeah.
I mean, you may be Mrs. Cooper- Nichol-Cooper-Roberts, but if you make my dad happy...
she does. I.
then I'm happy.
Marissa, how about some champagne?
sure.
Marissa, do you have anything to add?
Oh. One second.
Hey. Yeah.
you are?
okay, bye.
Congrats.
will you excuse me for a moment?
I'm...
where do you think you're going, young lady?
I got to go, Mom.
my friend called, and he says he needs me.
I need you.
I don't have to tell you how important this night is for our family.
Yeah, well, don't worry, Mom.
I'm not going to screw up your golden ticket.
I don't know if I'm a fan of Yakuza films.
it was an interesting movie, but a fun night.
Yeah. I would say anytime you get to watch a guy rip off his own arm to connue fighting, that's a really good night.
I just didn't understand the other fellow.
what, the guy that produced the ball of energy from hishest anthen destroyed the world?
I think it's pretty self-explanatory.
you remember when I took you to Fantasia?
cause I do.
I'm sorry you didn't like the movie.
Ah, it was worth it to spd some time with you.
I missed you.
well, do you want to do it again? Do you want a second date?
Yeah, but I get to pick the activity.
sure. Tomorrow night?
I have an idea already.
Hey.
we have a major problem.
marissa just bailed on our parents' engagement party to skank out with the surf Nazi.
your dad and Julie got engaged?
you kind of buried the lead there, Summer.
Julie and Dr. Roberts?
we've got bigger fish here, Cohen.
marissa is on a slut spiral, and we need to stop her.
that's a little out of my league.
I know; we need Ryan.
the code of silence has beenifted.
I'll talk to him...
but he's been in such a good mood.
so this is the pool house?
interested in making an offer?
uh, it's a little small, but it's got great views.
what? Locked?
when did this door get a lock on it?
little busy, Seth.
Yeah, you're not the only one.
listen, I didn't want to have to tell you this through the door, but Marissa's been hooking up with Volchok.
Oh, hey.
Oh. Hey.
Sadie, I didn't realize...
Yeah. Good night, Seth.
night. Call me, okay?
Yeah.
I guess I ruined the mood, huh?
just a lot.
you know, when I put the locks on,
I thought I solved the problem.
well, you know me.
when I have important informion to disseminate, nothing can stop me, not walls, not locks...
not women.
so what are you going to do?
reschedule with Sadie, and go back to her place.
no, I meant about Marissa.
what do you mean, what am I going to do?
well, Summer seems to think this Volchok guy is not exactly a beacon of morality.
eh, not my problem, not my girlfriend.
well, I know.
uh, two coffees.
look, man, she makes her own choices; so do I.
I choose Sadie's tonight.
so Zen these days.
it's simultaneously inspiring and disconcerting.
Ah, just feeling good, man, just feeling good.
Cheers.
I can't lieve you're getting married... again.
you make it seem like an everyday occurrence.
it almost is.
this time, it's going to stick.
it just feels real.
not everyone can have that Kirsten and Sandy relationship, that bionic, Kevlar-wrapped robo-marriage that can withstand anything you throw at it.
well, you've seemed happier than I've seen you in a long time.
Mm. Neil has mellowed me.
no more manipulative bitch, no more scheming, no more double-crossing, which will be a disappointment to some.
not for Dr. Robert
you know, we both just kind of found each other right at the moment when we really needed someone.
there's no agenda.
he does have a palatial estate.
if he wanted to live together in this trailer, I'd do it.
not that I'm offering.
real classy, Gus.
it's them BiGulps.
they go right through me.
sneak up on me, too.
that's a nice final image.
what's going on?
Oh, my God.
you the new tent?
nice to meet you.
we really need to get you out of here.
Hi.
Hi. What's up?
missed you in class.
Yeah, there was traffic.
we had that test today.
that was today?
Thanks.
got to go.
totally and completely untrue, and if Matt ever tried to print that, I will sue him for libel.
he seemed pretty sure of himself.
if it wasn't for me, your firm would be belly-up right now, which is why I don't appreciate your accusing me.
I'm not accusing anybody of anything.
forgive me for saying, Henry, but...
you seem a touch defensive.
the only business that I am in is the business of helping people.
I would like to believe that we are partners in that.
you give me your word,
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.
sandy, I didn't become a doctor to get rich.
you have my word.
thank you.
you did a wonderful job.
thank you.
Bye.
wee!
Hola, Mima.
I'm from the Philippines.
Oh, well, then.
wow, Coop.
you make a really good hood ornament.
funny.
I know.
Oh, you're getting drunk.
more like staying drunk.
Oh, good plan.
I can't deal with this right now.
well, you're going to have to, 'cause now, Coop, we're sisters.
right, which means, you're not my mom. You're right.
I know about Volchok.
I saw you mauling him at the Bait Shop.
I know you're shacking up with him at the trailer park.
Wow. Well, aren't you a regular Veronica Mars?
way to solve this week's mystery.
what has gotten into you?
since I know who has.
what do you care?
you have Seth and Ryan's got his new girlfriend.
Johnny's gone.
what difference does it make what I do?
I'm not hurting anyone.
Oh. You're just the saddest girl in the whole world.
grow up.
get over yourself.
take a shower.
fine. Why don't you take your little emo boyfriend, drive off in your Beamer, and go home to Daddy's mansion?
Oh, yeah, why don't you go with Volchok to one of his heavy metal vomit parties, and, like, listen to heavy metal and, like, vomit?!
Wow. You're being so lame. Not as lame as you.
fine. Bye. Later.
what are you doing?
taking what's mine.
you were supposed to turn over your key.
you're trespassing.
these are my personal files, which your office conveniently forgot to send.
I'm taking them.
no, you're not.
what are you gonna do? Arrest me, Sandy?
you gonna fight me?
you're acting like you got something to hide.
you're acting like a child.
if you're so sure that I don't have a case, then you shouldn't care if I leave with this box.
are you threatening me?
doesn't seem like I have a choice.
game on, Sandy.
wow, this is so romantic... and original.
Yeah, well, what can I say?
creature of habit.
Yes, yes, the lure of the chi fry.
a natural aphrodisiac.
Yeah, well, I think we'll be fine as long as Seth is nowhere nearby.
Seth, right.
well, good, good'cause I have something to tell you.
I have some good news.
yeah? Hey, you see that chick Volchok's with?
Aw, she ain't innocent.
Volchok show you the scratches on his back?
why don't we take this to go?
no, no, it's fine. Let's just go, come.
Sadie, it's fine- Sadie.
I'm not mad.
I just feel like, once again, you know, the mood was kind of ruined.
all right, well, okay, we can turn it around.
I think we're trying too rd.
maybe we need to let the perfect night just happen.
okay?
give it some time.
all right, fine.
let me at least drive you home.
okay.
just give me a second.
Ryan, don't.
Hey, look, it's little bitch.
Volchok around?
Why? You looking for your girlfriend?
no, actually I'm looking for him.
and if you see him, tell him that, and to meet me under the pier tomorrow morning.
you think you can remember all that?
you need me to write it down for you?
Yeah, bro, we'll tell him.
you know, I just knew.
I knew it was only a matter of time until you got in my face again.
just want to talk. About what?
your new girlfriend or mine?
cause, you know I got stories about both of them.
bet you do.
this where you tell me
I better leave her alone, that she's too good for me.
whoever Marissa wants to be with, it's not my place to jud.
saw her at school, she didn't look so good.
well, that girl couldn't look bad if she tried.
she was drinking; u know she's a problem with that, right?
she drinks, she gets drunk.
I don't see the problem.
just so you know, I'not looking after her anymore.
it's on you now.
treat her right.
she deserves it.
good morning, ladies.
I'd say a great morning.
we're a new family.
first breakfast together.
and tonight, we're going to have our first family dinner
something that hopefully will become a weekly tradition.
nothing like all sitting down together to a good meal.
discussing current events, catching up on each other's lives- doesn't that sound fun?
tons of.
I know Marissa has several events that she would lov to share with the family.
summer, maybe you can make that pineapple dessert I like, the one with e graham cracker things.
Oh, I'm sure Daddy's little girl would love to.
excuse me.
sisters.
Hey, man, I was looking for Sadie.
Hey. Yeah, she's in the shower.
or was.
Ryan, did you meet Bob?
Hey, Bob.
what's up?
garage door sticks a little.
cool.
make yourself at home. Thank you.
Yeah.
one bad date and I'm already replaced, huh?
all right, two bad dates.
he just bought the house.
he lives next door, and he made a really great offer.
that was my news last nghit, if you would have listened.
I know, I'm sorry. I was distracted.
you want to tell me what's up?
sure, um...
it's Volchok and Marissa.
but it's all good now.
there was a conversation I needed to have,
I had it, I'm done.
that's good.
it's just, I think I'm done, too.
what do you mean?
well, my aunt's business is handled.
the house is sold.
there's nd of no reason for me to be here.
there's no reason?
Ryan, I never intended to stay this long.
I was thinking it might be easier for me to leave, if...
if we didn't happen.
have you thought about this?
Yeah, I have.
have you?
Yeah.
I mean, if I stayed, I'd have to find an apartment, and then what?
wait for you to finish high school, follow you to college?
we're getting a little ahead of ourselves.
I honestly didn't think that much about the future.
I, uh...
was just hoping to take you to dinner.
you eat, right?
you haven't thought about it, because you're not ready to think about it, which I totally get.
but I can't change my whole life to be with someone who's distracted.
so that's it then.
no more smiling, no skipping, no more dancing.
you were never a fan of the dancing.
I don't know; might have come around.
now we'll never know.
Yeah, I can't just ask her to move here, change her whole life.
well, relocating to Newport might not be that big a deal.
put a lot of pressure on us, you know, on the relationship.
Ryan Atwood loves pressure.
he's not comfortable unless his entire body is being squeezed in a vice grip.
that is not true.
yeah?
you moved to China to help girl pregnant with a baby that might not even be yours.
Theresa needed someone.
stayed with Marissa for several years of tortured torture.
she was there for me, too.
but when it comes to pursuing your own happiness with a great girl who seems to be relatively issue-free...
I got to ask her to stay.
Yes, you do.
all right.
I saw that smile.
smiler.
I told you, Sandy, the kid's just posturing.
he's trying to get a rise out of you.
well, Matt said he has documents
he said he could prove what he's saying.
look, Sandy, I apologize.
now, what are you saying?
I'm saying, I've already let you shoulder too much of the responsibility on this situation.
now I'll handle it from here.
well, that sounds a little ominous.
what are you going to do?
you focus on the hospital.
there's a lot of people counting on you, and there's a lot of work to be done.
you've done too much already.
what was that you were saying about 18 holes at Big Canyon?
you're wearing that to a family dinner?
who says I'm going to dinner?
okay, Marissa, be mad at me if you want, but it is our family.
whatever
Hey, what's up?
the slut is still spiraling.
I thought I told you to talk to Ryan.
I did; I tried to activate his savior complex but it seems he's been cured.
Hey, I got to go; I'm hanging with my mom.
you're hanging with your mom?
I know, it seems a little weird.
but we thought we'd try something new.
so I'll talk to you later.
fine.
okay, bye.
all right?
Yeah. Where we going?
cardio bar? New Pilates?
something new.
let's give Marissa a few more minutes, shall we?
actually, I think we should just get started.
personally, I'm starving.
why don't we jus dig in and bon
what were we gonna do at this dinner?
discuss current events?
I think we live in a very fascinating time.
riveting.
Julie, why don't you ring her on her cell, see where she is?
I did call, several times.
well, I'm just a little concerned, you know.
she never missed dinner when she was staying here last semester.
that's because I wasn't here.
Neil, Maria and I haven't always had the greatest...
luck.
but you've always stood by each other through hard times.
isn't that great, Dad?
Yes, it is.
you Cooper girls are really something.
thank you, Neil.
and thank you, Summer.
will you pass the potatoes, please?
thought you and your mom fought all the time.
it's not my mom.
it's Summer.
you know, the only other time we really fought was in the fifth grade, when I sat in the back of the bus with Luke on the way to the Museum of Tolerance.
who's Luke?
summer and Luke were engaged...
in the second grade.
she doesn't like to talk about it.
why all the questions all of a sudden?
what do you mean?
you just seem very interested in my life.
I just, um...
we're hanging out.
seems like...
what?
um... you deserve to be treated rit.
if I wanted to be tread right, I wouldn't be with you.
works for me.
you want to bump?
I don't...
I mean... I've never.
there's a first time for everything.
guess I'm partying solo.
okay, what is this place?
you'll see.
crappy rec center basement, dark coffee?
I don't think you're into Weight Watchers, so either you're the lead in a communi theater group or have converted to an extremely underfunded religion.
Hi, I'm Ellen.
and I'm an alcoholic.
Hi, Ellen.
we will begin this evening with our reading of chapter five.
I thought if you knew, you wouldn't have come.
well, good instinct.
like going through this the first time wasn't painful enough.
this place has saved my family, my marriage, quite possibly my life.
these people know more about me than my own family.
well, whose fault is that?
it's not like you ever talk about what happened.
it's not like you ever ask.
and if this is how you act when I share it with you...
there's sharing and then there's lying.
well, we're here, and I'm not leaving.
so you can wait in the car, or you can do this for me.
just give me an hour.
it's important that you be here tonight.
is anyone gonna rip off their own arm and keep fighting?
metaphorically speaking, yeah.
Matt, this is Mitchell Kiven from the Register.
I got your message,
I'm extremely interested in talking about the Griffin story.
you've got the number.
Hey, Matt, it's Sandy.
we need to talk.
will you call me back as soon as you can?
look, it's cool, you guys take whatever you want.
I don't care. This isn't a robbery.
he Hey.
is, uh, Sadie around?
uh, no, actually, she, uh...
do you mind if I come in and wait?
well, I mean, it might be a while.
you just missed her.
she left for Oregon a couple hours ago.
I'm sorry.
Hey.
Hi.
what are you doing here?
sorry, I figured you were spending your time under the pier these days.
uh... I can go.
no, it's fine, I'm... I'm not going to stay.
Where's Sadie?
gone.
back to Oregon.
went over to see her, she'd already left.
without saying good-bye?
guess she thought it was easier this way.
and is it?
you know, you don't have to answer that.
I'm gonna go.
but, um...
enjoy, then.
I'll leave it as I found it.
I'd pissed in the streets, eaten out of garbage, and accidentally shot my wife- not once, but twice.
thank you very much.
that's a heartwarming tale.
he's been sober 30 years.
thank you for that, George.
before we leave, we have a couple of chips to hand out.
Kirsten, if you'd like to join me.
excuse me.
Congratulations.
you're nine months sober.
Oh, thank you.
all of you.
and, uh... especially my son, Seth, who's here with me tonight.
Hi, Seth.
Hey.
he doesn't know this, but...
he's the reason that I got sober.
the look on his face at my intervention...
he was so disappointed in me.
but he believed that I could do this...
and he was right.
congratulations, Mom.
only 29 years and three months more to go until you're as normal as William S. Burroughs over there.
never expected to see you here.
Yeah, well, I'm just glad I found you.
apparently, there's a lot of ways to leave Newport
bus, plane, etc.
Greyhound.
way to hedge your bets.
I'm just glad you're still here.
Why?
because I don't think you should leave.
Ryan really cares about you.
he told you that?
well, I mean, he didn't have to.
after everything we've been through,
I think I know him pretty well.
Yeah, well, this is my bus.
he wants you to stay.
he didn't try to stop me.
Yeah, he did, he was just a couple minutes too late.
why are you doing this?
well, I guess because you make Ryan happy.
Neil, dinner was amazing.
Yeah, Marissa's going to be sorry she missed it.
well, we have years of family dinners ahead of us.
Julie, you know this engagement is a trial, right?
what?
trial.
for you, me.
us together.
for the girls.
I mean, if our families aren't a good fit, then we really... shouldn't get married.
of course.
I mean...
love doesn't really conquer all.
and we both have the broken marriages to prove that.
but, Neil, surely this time...
sweetheart, I don't mean that in a punitive way,
I'm just trying to be practical.
I've got some reading to do.
I'll see you in minute.
Hey, baby. Oop!
good night, Dad. Good night.
I couldn't help overhearing...
what my dad just said.
but don't worry, cause he always gets this way as soon as he starts to get close to someone.
actually, Summer, the only thing I'm worried about is my daughter.
Yeah, me, too.
Hey, vodka on the rocks, please.
you got ID?
look, I drink here all the time.
Yeah, when Volchok's guys are buying.
can't you just make an exception this one time?
I used to date the manager.
sorry.
look, I'm having a bad night, and I really need a drink.
you and me both.
Oh, my God.
what happened?
like you don't know.
what are you doing here?
you tell me.
there's another bus in an hour.
what do I have to do to get you to stay?
I think you're doing.
glad to see you came back.
I wasn't sure if I should, uh...
no more talking.
here, let me help you with that.
so how was Berkeley? Was it amazing?
could be, if I was ready for it.
I'm not looking after her anymore-- - Treat her right.
I saw Theresa at the airport. She had a baby with her.
say hi, Daniel.
Hi, Daniel.
he's not yours, Ryan. Eddie's the father.
want to grab a bite? You can tell me about him.
Yeah, I'd like that.
to Sandy Cohen, who has told me countless times how important this hospital is to him.
Ouch.
they say that when you grow up, you marry your father.
I thought I'd escaped that.
all my sins, very detailed.
if I ever screw up again, you give that to my parents.
so, you are going to Brown. You just didn't want to come with me.
you're probably really confused right about now.
no, everything you've done up until now finally makes sense.
Rhode Island School of Design?
you'll be in the same state as Summer.
Seth is going to Brown, and he's dating Anna?
it's senior prom; it's mythic.
Yeah, well, it's ties and dresses and photos with parents.
sounds like any other dance to me.
well, it's not. It's a romantic capstone to your entire adolescence, and if Summer and I don't go together, it's over.
well, ask her.
Oh, she's still not talking to me.
well, have you told her there's nothing going on between you and Anna?
I tried, but every time we get close, she blows her rape whistle.
rape.
well, you know, I'm not going, so, if you, uh...
if you want to hang out, rent a movie...
Ryan, I love you, but if I have to spend my senior prom playing video games with you, I'm going to kill myself.
besides, I left Summer a message telling her I'm going to meet her at the diner tomorrow morning.
you think she'll show?
kind of pretended I was the Brown admissions guy.
it's senior prom; anything goes. Hi, there.
Hi. What's it going to be?
chicken, please. - And I'll have the beef.
why aren't you going to ask someone, man?
what about Tina Woo-- she's been looking really hot lately.
what about Theresa?
uh, yeah, I don't think so.
Why? You said you've been spending a lot of time with her.
we have. Actually, she's coming over to the house tomorrow.
okay, great-- now that the baby thing's resolved, the pressure's off.
it's perfect. Do it.
but, I mean, she still has the baby. She can't just, you know...
one night. They have these new crazy things called baby-sitters.
I'm just saying, it's senior prom.
she's your childhood sweetheart. You have to respect the romantic symmetry.
you know what? I'll think about it, and I appreciate you not bringing up the idea of Marissa and I going as friends.
no, I get it. It's in the past.
Plus, I assume she'll be going with the Surf Nazi anyways, unless he's selling crack to blind kids, or
or fondling some girl at the end of the pier.
Ah, maybe that's his cousin.
his really... dirty cousin.
Hi. Leave. - Okay, Summer...
no, I'm meeting someone here. You need to leave.
the Brown guy?
how did you know that?
I'm sorry. It was just the only way I could get you to meet me.
you are sick, you know that? Deranged.
no. - Yes.
no. - Yes.
no, our first kiss was on Halloween.
trust me, it was my sixth birthday, and my mom let me have dancing, but you didn't know how, so you hid in the bathroom.
and you tracked me down and kissed me. How did I ever block that out?
I don't know.
this is crazy. Do you want to go to prom with me?
what?
okay...
wait, that's not why I'm here.
so, you're going to think I'm... really lame, but...
would you maybe want to go to prom with me?
are you serious?
just give me two minutes. I ordered pancakes for you-- chocolate chip.
fine, two minutes, but that is it.
okay.
Hey, somebody wrote "prom" on my pancake. That is so weird.
weird! - Oh, my God.
Yeah, it's tomorrow night, so it's kind of late notice, but, um...
or not, or not. You know what? It's-it's probably a bad idea.
no, Ryan, it's just that... there's this guy that I work with, and we're not really dating or anything, but we've become close.
Yeah, no, I understand. Uh, I should probably get ready for school.
so, what, you just... hate prom?
pretty much.
Why? Did you have a bad prom experience?
cause, hey, you know, I've heard there's support groups for things like that, and really, I think you could recover.
I haven't spoken to you in four days.
you think pancakes and chocolate chips are going to make me forget that you and Anna went behind my back?
we did not...
or that I saw you guys at the airport, and your long, tearful good-bye?
you know...
what?
did I ever tell you how much my mom loves baby-sitting?
I, uh... I never actually made it to prom.
I, um...
I didn't get that close to graduation.
well, all the more reason to go now...
cause you'll have me there to protect you.
okay?
all right.
not only will I not go to prom with you, but if you and I were stranded on a deserted island,
I would take the nourishment that your meager frame has to offer, and then I would feed your bones to the sharks.
so, did she like the pancake? - Yeah, she loved it, and then she said if we were stranded on a deserted island, she'd feed my bones to the sharks.
I think it's hopeless.
Oh. Wait, she doesn't really think that we...
she saw us hugging in the airport.
Oh, my God, this is all my fault.
no, it's not your fault.
Yes, it is. If I hadn't been there, then you would have made up and you would be going to prom right now.
you have to tell her the truth.
Yeah, I tried, but... - No, no, no, not about us.
you have to tell her that you lied about getting into Brown.
I don't think I can do that.
but you have to, Seth. You have no other choice. You've done everything else.
Yeah, I know, but last time I lied,
I had to write out this big confession of everything I'd ever done wrong, and my whole drug phase and that...
you-you had a drug phase?
I smoked a couple of joints, but I promised I'd never lie again.
I don't think she's going to forgive me.
Seth, she wants to feed your bones to sharks.
you have nothing to lose.
listen, Anna, I appreciate your help, but, uh...
I don't know. It's over. I give up.
anyways...
I'm going to talk to you later.
man...
you off?
uh, I should be home in time for dinner. Hey, isn't this prom weekend?
weren't you and Julie talking about having everybody over here for pictures?
we did...
but Ryan doesn't have a date, and Seth and Summer seem to be in some kind of fight.
Oh, that's too bad. It's senior prom. It's a milestone.
maybe we should try and convince them to go anyway.
okay.
when are we going to talk about us?
in public again, or were you thinking about something a little more private this time?
I'm sorry I attacked you, but at least I got you to listen.
well, I'm sorry I made it so difficult for you.
so what do we do?
well, we should give the boys the weekend. They're going to be gone in a few months.
and then... you and I can figure out how best to proceed.
I, uh... I'm going to go.
sandy, there's something else.
at the end of that dinner, I...
I just wish I'd apologized then.
Oh, that's okay.
we'll be fine.
Hey, Taylor. - Summer, wait.
I have a big surprise for you.
but first, business. Here are yours and Marissa's prom tickets, and I need $50 from each of you for the after-party.
I rented out the Bait Shop. It is going to be such a rager.
you know what? I don't think I'm going to go.
you were prom queen last year. You have to go.
Yeah, well, the queen is dead.
I see.
well, perhaps you would like to hear who your date is.
what are you talking about?
I got you a date. - Taylor!
quiet. You know how I'm going with Sung Ho?
the guy from the Korean barbecue?
Oh, yeah, we, like, totally found each other at the sweatshirt party.
he's got this wonderfully hairless body.
it's like hooking up with a seal.
I have to go.
so, it turns out his cousin Young Nam is visiting from Seoul.
and his English is a little...
but Sung Ho says he is huge on the K-pop scene.
what the hell is K-pop? - Korean pop-- K-pop.
anyway, his band's called Big Korea, and he's a model, too.
they actually based a couple of anime characters on him.
Taylor, I'm not going to go to prom with some Asian pop singer that barely speaks English.
summer. - Ow.
cohen deceived you.
it is your duty as a woman to make him feel pathetic and small by going to prom with the hottest guy you can find.
that's a good point.
are you sure he's hot?
sung Ho said at his last concert, a gang of crazed school girls torched a cop car.
big Korea.
Hey. How you doing?
Hey. Good.
are those prom tickets?
Yeah. I asked someone.
Oh, well, that's great.
Yeah.
so, the baby...? - Really cute, but not mine.
well, what about you? Are you... are you going?
I can't remember whether you and Volchok are still together or...
Yeah, on both counts.
yeah?
he wasn't exactly enthusiastic, but he said yes.
Oh, that's-that's, uh... that's great.
Yeah.
okay, I should be getting to class.
um, congratulations on the Theresa thing.
see you. - See you.
Hey, it's Summer. Leave a message.
summer, hey.
I just, I just want to apologize for what happened in the girls' bathroom today.
I didn't mean to follow you in, or spook Mrs. Rushfield.
I'm just trying to explain the idea of a romance between me and Anna so insane that...
Hello, Seth.
I got to go.
Yeah, yeah. All right, all right, all right.
well, well, look who's here.
I want to talk to you.
hmm. Yeah, I'm not really in the mood to talk, but try me later.
Ken, listen.
I saw you on the pier last night.
huh. Last night, last night...
Yeah, I don't, I don't remember that far back.
maybe you remember the girl you were with?
long hair, tattoos, not much like Marissa?
you know, you are something else, man.
but tell me this-- why would I cheat on Marissa?
I mean... that girl's hot, right?
in every way.
but then you already knew that, didn't you?
you want to see how far you can push me, keep at it.
I already fell for that Lethal Weapon psycho bit once.
it's not happening again.
Hey, Kevin. I think there's like a snake in the shower...
what are you doing here?
Yeah, Ryan. What are you doing here?
uh...
uh, Kirsten called. She's having people over for photos tomorrow, and I just thought I'd invite you.
Oh, that's really sweet.
Yeah, so sweet.
okay, ignore him. We'll be there.
Yeah.
Hello?
Hey.
Hi. Anna. Seth said you were in town.
Hey, how are you?
I'm good, and you look much more grown up.
Yeah, well, don't we all? You staying with your parents?
my aunt and my uncle.
last year, my parents switched houses. We're a quirky family.
Yeah.
are you going to prom?
Yeah, actually. I'm going with Theresa.
Hey, there she is. Look at a true friend, Ryan.
2, 000 miles she flies. - In a middle seat.
all to make sure Summer and I go to the prom together.
now, tell me, would you do so much?
let's not test it.
well, guilt could be a powerful motivator.
I'd tell you again that it's not your fault, except I want to hear this plan.
in phase one...
uh! Hear that, Ryan? Phase one.
that suggests multiple phases.
in phase one, I am going to go over to Summer's right now, and tell her that there is nothing going on between us.
okay.
out of curiosity, what you got for phase two?
in the off-chance that phase one fails, phase two-- you take me to prom.
I brought a dress.
Yeah, I better get going.
I'll call you.
see you later. - Bye-bye.
Bye.
I don't know, I kind of like it.
I'm going to kill Taylor.
Why? Come on. He's cute.
how can you tell? He's in a space suit.
so do you think Kevin will like this?
Yeah, if it rips off easy.
this was supposed to make Seth jealous.
what's that? - Just Seth's napkin confession, detailing all his lies and deceptions, including his pathetic two-week stoner phase.
you know what? I think it is time for Sandy and Kirsten to know their son a little better.
what? Summer, you can't do that.
Oh, I can.
we had a deal.
he told me that if he screwed up, I could show this to his parents.
revenge.
don't you think that maybe he's telling the truth about him and Anna?
I mean, do you really think that they would do that to you?
Hi.
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
Oh, my God. - No.
Hi, Anna. It's good to see you again.
you, too.
I'm going to go... try this on.
I need you.
what are you doing here?
summer, I wanted to talk to you.
you have to believe me.
there is nothing going on between me and Seth.
you are still my Blanche, you know?
nice try. I saw you guys hugging at the airport.
that was... not what you think it was. We were celebrating.
celebrating what?
the future.
if I flew 2, 000 miles, I'd probably come up with a better story.
no, it's the truth. Seth...
look. My date's going to be here soon. He's kind of a rock star.
you may have heard of him, Big Korea.
Yeah. Well, not surprised. Thanks for coming by.
look, Summer, I'm sorry that you don't believe me, but if you're already going with someone, would you mind if I went with Seth?
why would I mind?
okay, then. I'll see you there.
see ya.
so, uh, how exactly does this plan go again?
summer sees me with Anna at the dance, and confronted with the reality of a world without Seth Cohen, she comes to her senses.
Uh-huh, because a world without you...
is a world without sun.
Ryan, it's a world without warmth.
I don't get it, either, but I think we should trust Anna on this one.
she has more knowledge of the female psyche than either you or I could hope for.
that's so true.
aren't you guys ready yet?
people are going to be here.
what is it? What's wrong?
no. You look... I'm getting ready still.
Hello, welcome. - These are my parents.
how are you? Nice to see you.
come on in.
you look beautiful. - You, too.
that's Summer's date.
looks like the guy in Full Metal Alchemist.
Kirsten, here are the Yangs, Elena and Tom.
Hey. How are you? - Hey.
Hi. - Oh, my God, you look beautiful.
you too. It's good to see you.
glad you could make it.
Ryan. I'm so glad that you and Seth found dates.
thank you.
so I'm going to need 50 bucks from each of you for the after-party.
Oh, I'll take care of that.
there you go.
thank you, very much Mr. Cohen.
you're welcome. Attention, everybody:
the limos are waiting, so, ladies, please put your purses and your wraps and things on the bar, so we can all go out to the pool and take pictures.
all right?
Yeah, yeah. - Where's the bathroom?
uh... down the hall.
okay, you guys, we all need one with all of the kids. Get together.
Oh, hey. Has anyone seen Kevin? I think he's still in the bathroom.
all right, I'll get him.
the, uh, the parents want to take a photo of everyone.
we're waiting on you.
fine.
look.
what now?
you going to tell me I can't drink?
no, actually I don't have a problem with your drinking, but if you screw this up for Marissa,
I'm going to kick your ass.
okay.
Oh, my God. You know what this is?
what?
this is the pirates' cave from Goonies. I've died and gone to heaven.
Taylor, this is amazing.
Yeah, this is way better than any dance I ever designed.
Oh, my God, Marissa, that means so much to me.
you know, I've been saying that, but no one listens.
wow, Seth, you and I at prom together, who would have thought.
I know. I guess sometimes things just work out.
laughing boy.
Hi. Where's that flask you're always whipping out?
Oh, you want to spike the punch?
read my mind.
all right. Follow me.
that's so unlike you.
big Korea.
Hi. Hi.
come on, go.
why don't I go put my purse down and then we can hit the dance floor?
all right. - Okay.
you sure about this?
Yes, Seth, you're just going to have to trust me.
come on, let's go take a picture with Captain Hook.
all right. - Come on.
Oh, hi, Lisa. - Hi.
I'm so glad you made it back for prom.
I wouldn't have missed it for anything.
or... I thought you did great on Idol.
Oh, by the way, do you know where Simon gets those skintight V-necks?
I totally want to get one for Sung Ho.
have I thanked you yet for coming?
mm, about 40 times.
is something wrong?
your little friend walked off with my flask.
Yeah, well, I'm sure she'll bring it back.
all right, well, I'm going to go smoke some kush.
want to come?
you know, I actually kind of want to enjoy prom, but come find me when you get back.
did I hear something about smoking certain substances?
cause I know someplace private.
lead the way.
maybe I'm being sentimental, but watching the kids head off to the senior prom,
I can't help but think, where did the time go.
I remember the first day that Summer went off to kindergarten.
she changed her outfit three times, and she came home from school crying because another girl was wearing the same top.
the other girl was Marissa.
of course.
and wasn't it kindergarten that Seth would only answer to Boba Fett?
gosh, Boba Fett.
that was fourth grade.
no, it was fifth grade.
gosh, you know, I just can't believe that I was only a year older than Marissa is now when I married Jimmy.
it's amazing the surprises life brings you.
some good, I hope. - Very good.
I'd like to propose a toast to the two of you.
I'm sorry Sandy and I haven't thrown you an engagement party, but we couldn't be more pleased.
thank you. - Cheers.
Cheers. - Cheers.
wouldn't you know? I'm sorry.
I have to take this; it's a colleague. I'll be right back.
such a busy man.
Yes.
well, I just hope Neil and I are as happy as you and Sandy.
no, actually, I'm having dinner at his home right now.
what's up?
can I tell him?
right.
okay.
all right, I feel good about that. - All right.
why don't we go dance? - Thank you.
like dancing...
I'm just going to go talk to her.
no, Seth, you can't.
well, look at her-- she looks miserable.
let alone... kind of plastered.
well, that's the point.
at least the miserable part.
I don't think I can do this.
Seth, the plan is working.
I mean, it was easy for her to doubt you when you're all begging to get back together with her.
but now that she might have really lost you, she's thinking, maybe I should have really believed him.
Really? 'Cause it looks to me like she's describing how she'd use my body for food then feed my bones to the sharks.
excuse me, can I have your attention, please?
Hi.
I would like to welcome you all to the Pirate's Ball.
thank you.
okay, now, uh, before I announce your Pirate King and Queen,
I would just like to take this moment to...Say that it's been an honor to be your social chair this year...
just open the envelopes!
well, excuse me if I have slaved away all year just so you could have a good time.
boring.
fine.
Oh, um, just so you know,
I thought it was only fair to take myself out of the running, so no calling for a recount.
okay, uh...
your 2006 queen is...
Oh, my God, two years in a row, Summer Roberts.
Oh, my God.
go, Summ!
Oh, my God. I don't think you're boring. I love you.
thank you so much. Thank you so much.
I like you guys, thank you so much.
you guys... What's going on?
Oh, tiara. - Oh, tiara.
okay, thanks.
um, yeah, so thank you so much because being your queen is just...
is it like a million degrees in here or what?
woo, it's hot.
you know what? Perhaps we should find out who your king is.
screw that.
you know what? Actually, let me, um... introduce you to my date.
hold this.
he's right here. This is my date.
he is the number one pop star in Korea.
bang bang.
anyway, I promised him that if I won that I would give him a big fat kiss.
this is not part of the plan.
she's just fighting it. This is good.
how do you like that, Cohen?
man overboard! Man overboard!
Oh, my God. Are you okay?
what idiot made that stage so short?
summer, are you okay?
back off.
whoa, um.
just, everyone leave me alone.
she probably just needs a moist washcloth or maybe like a towelette.
Cohen. - What? What?
is there a "no towelette" clause in your plan?
because right now I'm thinking phase two kind of sucks.
does anyone have a towelette? Does anyone have a towelette?
we must find a towelette! - Is she all right?
Yeah, I think maybe it's time to go to the after-party, though.
that's a good idea.
Hey, I couldn't find Kevin. He just disappeared.
okay, I'll find him.
Oh, right, I better go...
who is it?
um, this is the guy, I...
I told him I was coming here tonight and I should probably take this.
I'm sorry, I know, it's gotten a little crazy.
Yeah. A little crazy.
little bit.
but there's no place that I would rather be.
and that's what I'm going to tell him.
I'll see you in a minute.
Hey, what are you doing?
so Sung Ho and his cousin got Summ in the limo, but have you found Kevin?
no, no, let's look inside.
Oh, he might have come out here to smoke.
no, he didn't, I checked.
you checked? - Yeah.
why are you being weird?
are you sure he's not out here?
Oh, my God.
get out of here.
what?
get out of here.
jerk.
is that it? Can I go now?
Why? - What did you expect, huh?
did you think you were just going to dress up your bad boy, take him to your little rich kid's party, so your friends can see how cool you are?
you know it's not like that. - Oh, please.
you just wanted to turn me into little bitch boy like him.
you're nothing like him.
clearly, I was wrong about you.
finally, you're learning.
honestly, Kirsten, I'm so glad you guys are doing better.
you really scared me last week.
I even scared myself.
last week at dinner, I had a drink.
What?! Oh, my God.
now, it was the first in 11 months, it was only one glass,
I've been going to AA meetings every day, but it happened.
have you talked to Sandy about this?
no. I tried, even before when I could feel it coming, but...
Kirsten, you have to tell him.
that the stress of our marriage has triggered my drinking?
Yes, that's exactly what you say.
I am not gonna use my alcoholism as blackmail to save our marriage.
if he can't value it for what it is, then what is the point?
well, what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
the way things are between Sandy and I right now,
I just feel like one push could send us over the edge.
Hello? Trash cans exist for a reason.
Oh... Excuse me. Hi.
I have a security deposit on this place, and I'd like it back.
Hey, so, the guy at the door is gonna let me know if Volchek tries to get in.
how you doing?
I'm okay.
you know, I think I'm just gonna go home, though.
Marissa, this is your prom.
Yeah, it was prom before my boyfriend hooked up with another girl.
um... okay, I'm gonna go get a drink.
summer, it's us. How you feeling?
go away, let me die alone.
I think it's time for phase three.
there's a phase three? Why didn't you mention that before?
duh, there's always been a phase three.
the other two were just to make you realize that you don't have a choice.
you have to tell her the truth, about everything.
who is she talking about?
I bet you think it's really smart because she's the smart girl.
I'm gonna go. I fly back tomorrow, but I'll see you both in Providence.
summer, feel better.
and remember Seth loves you.
Anna, thank you.
Bye.
you know what? I don't think she's that smart. I think that she's dumb.
she's got a dumb name and dumb hair.
listen, I don't expect you to respond or even remember this, but the truth is, I actually didn't get in to Brown.
What?!
too fast.
I knew you weren't gonna go if I didn't go, and I didn't want you to do that, and I didn't want you to miss the opportunity, so I broke up with you.
that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
Yeah, well, then I realized I couldn't be without you, so I flew there to try and talk my way in.
okay, now that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
but it's very romantic. Did it work?
no, it didn't.
but Anna got me an interview at RISD, and they read my comic book, and they really liked it, so...
so that's why you were hugging her at the airport? Oh, my God.
listen, I know I promised I'd never lie again when I gave you that letter.
Oh, my God, the letter.
what?
cohen, I have a confession.
Oh, wow.
wow, that's impressive.
I love you. - I love you, too.
we can kiss later.
all right, want me to hold your crown?
No! - All right.
hey... Rigatoni-- Nice.
what's going on?
listen, that call I got was a friend of mine on the hospital board, and, um, there are rumors floating around about certain improprieties concerning Griffin and you.
monday morning the board is gonna suspend Griffin, and they're gonna call for a criminal investigation into the both of you.
Neil, it's getting late-- I think we should be going.
Yeah, right. Kirsten, thanks for a lovely evening.
Oh, my pleasure.
well, we'll walk you out.
is everything okay?
Yeah.
well, she's not here-- she must've gone home.
she'll be okay.
you know, you probably don't see it, but she's changed.
she's gotten stronger.
so have you. - Yeah? Think so?
the Ryan I knew would've gotten in a fight with that guy back at the prom.
I know part of you still wants to, but you didn't.
and that's what matters.
so, you like the new me.
well... he's still not much of a dancer, but...
What?!
you're right, I'm not.
you know, nothing between us could ever be casual-- there's too much history.
Yeah, I know.
I just don't think that anything should happen tonight.
absolutely not. Absolutely...
okay, good.
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!
Taylor, what happened? - Oh, my God.
the money is gone! I had the money in my purse. I had $5, 000 in my purse. It's gone.
I brought it down at prom-- someone must've taken it.
we should call the police.
you know what, don't bother, don't bother. I know where it is.
what do you mean, you know? I think I'm gonna hyperventilate.
is everything okay? - Yeah, it will be.
what do you want?
you decide how this is gonna go.
prom, huh? Hell of a night.
you probably think I'm an idiot, huh?
screw things up with Marissa, steal money when everyone's gonna know I took it.
I don't think about you.
but yes, you're an idiot.
maybe it wasn't gonna work out with Marissa.
and at least now...
...you and I can settle this.
I'm not here to fight you.
sure you are.
otherwise, you'd have called the police.
come on. You know you're dying to.
just give in.
all right, all right, all right, I get it-- it's about the money.
but tell me this.
a week from now, if I wanted to,
I could have her on her back on that mattress.
articulating your feelings to your girlfriend- kind of a challenge.
how do you feel? - I...
I see the great love of your life.
it's George. - George? George?
I'm here to offer you a job.
he heard about my work with the sea otters and invited me to travel across the country and talk to college kids about voting.
why don't you give Jason Spitz a call?
you're always saying how funny he is.
I don't have that many guy friends anymore.
who does? Who's got the time?
where the heck's your mom?
I know I asked you to be my stepdad.
do you mind being my friend instead?
tell me what it is that you love about Julie.
we're just from the same world.
72 HOURS EARLIER
Taylor, I'm not buying you lingerie for your birthday. That's just weird.
okay, that's fine.
you and Ryan are throwing me a birthday party and that's enough.
look, I know you've never had a birthday party before, let alone been to one, but usually people get presents for their birthday, so will you please tell me what you want?
okay, honestly, I want Ryan to ask me to go to Berkeley with him next year.
okay, I was thinking more along the lines of a cute top.
I know, I know, it's just, I'm a planner, and I've already seeing that day six months in the future when we all go our separate ways.
and I just know that if Ryan goes to Berkeley and I go to Harvard or Princeton or Oxford, then it's over.
don't you have to apply to Berkeley first in order to...
you already applied to Berkeley? Does Ryan know this?
no. I applied before we even started dating.
I just got back from France and I figured, well, I had to go somewhere, so I reapplied to Princeton, Oxford, Yale, Harvard and the Sorbonne, and I figured why not throw Berkeley in?
hmm.
um, hi. Can we get two coffees, please?
uh, yeah. - Okay.
so you want to get Ryan to tell you that he wants you to go to Berkeley, without knowing that you already got in to Berkeley?
exactly. - And how're you going to do that?
easy. I just need to get him to tell me that he loves me.
Mm-hmm, Ryan talking about his feelings.
now that would be an earth-shattering event.
careful, they're hot.
thank you. - Thanks.
did you see this about earthquake weather?
you know, it's exactly this kind of voodoo science that lets politicians deny global warming.
Oh, my God, I know.
and how many times have they predicted the big one, and it never happens.
it almost makes you wish that it would.
Hey.
good morning. - What's the occasion?
just you're being so sweet throwing me a birthday party, and I wanted to thank you, so...
Oh, my gosh, did I ever tell you about...
how you've never had a birthday party and you've always spent every birthday alone in your room watching Sixteen Candles and talking to a gypsy on the psychic hot line?
Yeah, I know, I'm a broken record.
just, you know, it really means a lot to me that you're doing this for me.
well, Taylor, I'll tell you, planning your birthday party is not easy.
I expect something in return.
Oh.
I expect to have my way with you.
well, all that time and energy. Clowns, balloons, a magician...
Oh, oh, well, if there's a magician.
Yeah.
it's kind of strange to think about all of this ending isn't it?
hmm?
you, going off to Berkeley, me, whichever way the wind blows.
well, it's still six months away.
right, yeah. If only I had a crystal ball, huh?
maybe I should call Esmerelda from the psychic hot line.
this is a really good croissant.
don't you have the feeling that we're on the cusp of something and we just need to leap into the void?
did you get these at Joe's?
Ryan, don't you have that feeling?
what?
that life is telling us to take a wild, impulsive jump into the unknown?
not really.
so, you're good?
you don't have a need to just let something explode out of you, consequences be damned?
what are we talking about?
well, I was...
I guess it's just my birthday and I'm getting sentimental.
all right, well, don't worry. It's going to be great.
okay?
all right, I've got to go. Thanks for this.
Hey, tonight, you want to do something? See a movie?
Yeah, sure, okay.
all right, great.
Oh, my God.
Oh, hi, honey. Sorry, I didn't hear you coming down.
mom, do you mind? Because I still have to eat in here.
what can I get you? You want some scrambled eggs or I could whip up some pancakes.
you cook, too? That's amazing.
it's just a talent I have.
Yeah, one of many.
I'm seriously never going to stop barfing.
Caitlin, don't be gross.
me? Gross? What's gross is Frank's dirty germy convict bag is sitting on the counter.
I mean, what, did the warden give that to you as a going-away present?
Caitlin. - It's okay. It's okay.
it shouldn't be on the counter. Though I actually got it at REl.
well, why bother with a bag? You can just move in.
you spend enough time here anyway.
young lady, apologize.
I'm sorry, Frank.
feel free to have as many conjugal visits as you'd like.
you know, I... I should get going. I've got a job interview.
I'll walk you out. - Okay.
and we'll talk later.
Mrs. Cohen?
I went to Harbor with Seth. - Oh, hi.
Hi, are you here for prenatal yoga?
Oh, yes, I am. And you?
Yes. I just found out. How far along are you?
Oh, not-not very. I just found out, too.
well, this class is great.
I told Missy, the instructor, I have worked way too hard for this body to just let it turn into some dumpy baby factory.
I mean, who says I can't have a baby and a six pack?
I should probably stretch before class.
well, hold on just a second.
Hey, hos, come here.
this is Mrs. Cohen. She just found out she's pregnant.
Oh, my gosh! Congratulations.
and you're not even showing.
So...should we let her in?
Oh, yeah. Totally. She's ripped.
we formed a club.
promised ourselves we wouldn't turn out like Molly the Mammoth over there.
eww.
in nine months I'm wearing my bikini. I don't care what anyone says.
and I told Jerry if I get too big, I'm inducing at eight months.
it's much easier to lose the weight.
so do you want in? We call ourselves the Six-Pack Pack.
isn't that like so cute? Don't you just want to barf?
all the time.
summer, what's up? - Hey.
I am just picking up Seth.
taking him to an art exhibition, sponsored by GEORGE, the Global Environmental Organization regarding Greenhouse Emissions.
Seth's going to an art show.
well, yeah, I mean, he's going to art school, and I like the environment, so I thought it was the perfect date.
sure.
so are you ready for Taylor's party?
Oh, yeah, party's all set. Even got her a present.
really. Mind telling me what it is?
well, you know, she likes translating those French love poems?
I collected a few. Had them bound for her.
Atwood, that is so romantic.
you know, nothing is as romantic as the first time you tell someone you love them, though, huh?
I, uh...haven't told Taylor I love her. - You haven't?
has she said something?
no. No, I-I just assumed.
you guys have been together for a while and you seem pretty happy.
I thought,"Why wouldn't you have said I love you?
I have an idea. Why don't you?
what? - For her birthday.
you should, because... the book of poems is awesome, but add that special little "I love you. " As as girl,I don't know, me personally, I got chills.
does Taylor expect me to tell her that I love her on her birthday?
what? No. I don't know. I've got to go.
I can't stay, okay?
well, thanks for meeting me. I wanted to talk to you alone.
you're not going to do anything pervy are you?
I care about your mom.
and considering my past, I understand why you're suspicious.
look, I really don't care that you went to prison, all right?
I mean, the Bullet went to prison and he was awesome.
you're just boring.
I'm sorry, but it's just the way it is.
well, I have to say I don't think that's fair. You hardly know me.
then say something funny. - What?
make me laugh.
fine.
I don't know what interests a 15-year-old girl, but your mother doesn't think I'm boring.
well, that's because you're sleeping with her.
can you not say that kind of thing?
well, what do you want me to say? I mean, is it true in prison on your first day, you got to make someone your bitch?
or what about the whole dropping the soap thing?
I mean, really, why don't you guys just install soap dispensers?
Hey, I make your mom happy.
I'm just asking for a chance here, Caitlin.
of course.
if it makes my mom happy.
Oh, my God.
Oh... my God.
that was so amazing.
you know, he's so right.
if we aren't good custodians for our planet, what right do we have to be here?
don't you think that was amazing?
I give it a three. - A three?
he put a radio transmitter in a piece of trash, threw it into the ocean, followed it around for six years just to show how pollution travels.
and you're giving it a three?
I'm gonna give it a three-and-a-half, then.
what about the part where he followed it through the oil fires in the Persian Gulf, and he got third-degree burns on his arms?
I know, but the camera work was terrible, and what kind of film stock was he using?
the oranges and reds totally bled together.
he was just making a point to show the health of our planet.
Yeah, but he's also making a movie, and as a movie, it sucks.
well, what about that one?
where the turtle adopted the hippo who was lost in the tsunami?
that's pretty much the nature film equivalent of a chick flick.
okay.
what about that?
where the family of giraffes' habitat was destroyed.
Yeah, shot like a perfume ad.
God, what is your problem, Seth?
I just want you to get excited about something.
I am, about things that are good.
but I could do one of these doughnuts with both hands tied behind my back.
Really? Prove it.
what? - Make a movie.
are you serious? - Yeah.
I want see you do it better.
I want to go watch the penguins again, and don't you dare say anything.
Hey, I didn't know you were coming by.
I was just at Spitzy's office. You should have called.
is everything all right?
the people in Newport are awful.
honey, you're a little late to the party. I've been saying that for 20 years.
has it gotten worse?
I mean, I know Julie and some of the others are bad, but...
what happened?
I was at this prenatal yoga class and these young women, they're monsters.
they wanted me to join the six-pack pack. - The what?
and then they talk about inducing labor at eight months so that they don't have to gain weight.
can we raise another child around this?
Oh, honey, Newport's always had that element, and still we managed to have a life.
and not everybody's like that. You know what?
spitz has been wanting us to meet his wife.
how about we do dinner tomorrow? Restore your faith in humanity.
all right.
but more importantly, do you think they'll let me join the six-pack pack?
I've been doing my sit-ups. Come on, hit me with your best shot.
go ahead, come on, wind up.
I'm not a beast!
Oh, God, he really loves her.
and she is never going to know how he feels, because he can't tell her.
isn't that tragic? - Yep.
I mean, how could you do that?
how could you just let the love of your life slip away because you were too afraid to tell them how you really felt?
well, maybe she's better off.
Uh-huh.
did you get that from the scene where she was about to be burned at the stake?
no, she's a beautiful woman, he's a hunchback who lives in a bell tower.
the chances of it working out...
Yeah, but he doesn't know that.
if he at least told her how he felt, then maybe there would be a way to work things out.
you know, they could have a life together. Or you know, at least four more years.
why did you save me?
but the archbishop...
Ryan, I'm not talking about the movie.
it's... There's just moments in everyone's life, and if you just let them slip away, then... then they're gone forever.
and that's the tragic thing about life.
don't you feel that way?
I missed the last part of the movie.
would you mind rewinding it a little?
sure.
Thanks.
lonely, huh?
good morning.
if you say so.
what's that?
this is the obituary for mine and Ryan's relationship.
a rose, plucked before its time.
Uh-huh, English?
I wrote a letter to the Dean of Berkeley, telling him that I must respectfully decline the scholarship, and he should offer it to the next candidate.
so you're saying no?
what happened with Ryan?
I tried, Summer, I really did.
the moment was upon us. We were staring into each other's eyes, and...
and he just didn't say it.
you know, sometimes I just want to grab him and tie him to a chair and shoot him full of sodium pentathol and see what spills out.
why don't you?
you don't think it's too crazy? Because I was thinking if the two of us just tackled him and then we could tie him down...
I wasn't talking literally.
Oh.
do you love him?
Yeah, I really do.
do you think he loves you?
well, sometimes he grabs my hand and he squeezes it for no reason.
I mean, what else could that mean?
okay. So we just need to loosen his tongue a little.
but how are we going to...
summer Roberts, you bad thing.
okay, you know what, a trip to the Robert's wine cellar is in order.
what the hell is he doing?
morning. - Morning.
Hey, are you all right?
Yeah, it's just a cramp.
how far did you go?
mm, nine, ten miles.
Oh. Wouldn't it be easier if you just said, "Sandy, there's something bothering me. Can you give me some advice?
Yes, it would, but where's the fun in that?
let me guess.
you're trying to decide if you love Taylor so you can tell her on her birthday.
huh?
you've been dating for a while, things are good, birthday's tomorrow.
bingo.
Yeah. You're good.
so? Do you love her?
uh, honestly I'm scared.
good, you should be.
that's reassuring.
well, it might be the most powerful thing you can say to another person.
it changes everything.
now for heaven's sake, if you don't feel it, don't say it.
Yeah, it's just I think she's expecting it. And to not say it...
it's like saying you don't love her.
exactly.
well, do you care about her? - Of course.
do you enjoy being with her?
more than with anyone.
tell her that.
it won't be exactly what she wants to hear, but it'll be honest.
all right.
can you tell me something? - Sure.
do you have any idea why Seth is filming the pool?
Hey, check it out, man.
summer challenged me to make this pretentious art film, so I'm making one called Six Hours In The Pool.
sounds great.
Yeah, I'll tell you about it later.
uh, Taylor called. She wants you to go over there for dinner.
Oh, okay. - Yeah. Okay.
Ah, it's perfect.
look, Frank, I get that men have urges, and I imagine prison is one of those places where those urges get twisted, but...
Julie... - I've never even heard of clown porn.
I mean that photo where they're all stuffed into the little car...
it's not mine.
Oh, really?
it was just in your bag, along with... this?
I mean, which one of us is supposed to wear this?
Julie, none of this is mine.
so someone just went into your bag, planted a wig and some really bad clown porn.
who would...
Oh... Caitlin.
Julie, it's all right.
no, Frank, it's not.
my daughter is trying to sabotage this relationship.
and where would she get her hands on clown porn?
she's just hazing me, you know?
it'll be good for me to show her that I can take it.
it'll blow over. It's not serious.
did you see Page 50?
how much more of this is there?
five hours and 58 minutes.
what are you doing?
I'm not going to sit here and watch six hours of the pool.
I told you to become engaged in something. Instead, you just set up a tripod.
it's a satire.
it's a comment on the lack of artistic rigor...
no, it's you being lazy.
how many naps did you take while you made this?
I took two to res...
do you feel like you're overreacting a little bit? I mean, what does it really matter?
that's the problem, Seth.
you did this because you chose the path of least resistance.
you know, you could have made a movie about anything in your life, and instead you chose this.
so what am I supposed to do?
follow Ryan around with a camera until he punches someone?
Yes, anything that engages you in the world.
what is the point?
well, if nothing else, it's important to me.
Thanks.
Mr. Spitz. - How are you?
Kirsten, how's it going? - Hello, Jason.
listen, you guys, I want you to meet my wife, come on.
no way, really?
well, then what did she say?
honey, honey.
Oh, my God. What a complete ho-bag.
honey.
I got to go. Call me back.
love you, bitch.
Hi.
I am so sorry.
Kirsten and Sandy Cohen, this is Carrie, my wife.
so nice to meet you. - You, too.
that was my girlfriend. She's having trouble dating this guy, and the guy's wife is all like, uh,"I'll kill you."
wow, I imagine that could be a little hard to handle.
Oh, whatever. Not my problem.
so, Carrie, you're from Newport?
Oh, yeah, born and bred.
really. Interesting.
Oh, now, Sandy, let's get to it.
how can we convince Jason here to get out of that soup kitchen he calls an office and get a real job?
Oh, thanks, that's good.
for luck.
uh, actually, Taylor, I'm not that big a wine drinker.
I know, you can't have coq au vin without the vin.
well, that's true.
okay.
you know, I feel kind of bad, you making dinner the day before your birthday.
no, it's my pleasure. Absolutely.
Oh, sorry. - It's okay.
I'm nervous 'cause I've never cooked for you before.
okay, cheers.
Oh, yeah.
whoo, bottoms up.
Mmm.
yummy. Tasty.
so, uh... Oh, that's...
so, Taylor, there's something I want to talk to you about.
no, let's save all the serious conversation for after dinner.
we don't want it to get cold.
okay.
hmm, I think I need another sip.
wow, do you detect a hint of blackberries?
mm, no, I don't.
try it. It's fun, come on.
uh...
okay.
Nope, no blackberries.
I think you need to take a bigger sip.
you still go to your sorority rush?
sandy, sisterhood doesn't just end with graduation.
a Tri-Delt once, a Tri-Delt forever.
Oh, but last year, I got so sick.
totally embarrassing.
I can only imagine.
and I thought, "Carrie, what gives?
can't you hold your liquor anymore?
Ugh! And then I realized it was just morning sickness.
was that a relief.
you know, I'm afraid it's getting a little late for us.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
you are not running away. This great bar just opened up on Ocean.
when was the last time you two did tequila poppers?
maybe another time.
Oh, tell meyou're not bailing because you're pregnant.
I mean, no offense, but that is lame.
Carrie, no. - What? It's lame.
actually, I'm an alcoholic.
Oh, God.
me, too.
Hey, after you have that thing, we should totally go out.
you know, without the two dish rags.
Oh, God!
can you just take that thing outside?
Oh, don't freak. I'm not a psycho.
it's our baby.
when we go out with the baby, Carrie likes to have the nurse sit nearby, a few tables away.
Oh, you know, Sandy, I'm-I'm, uh, suddenly...
I'm, I'm not feeling well.
I'd better get you home.
thank you both for an unforgettable evening.
Jason, I'll talk to you Monday.
Yeah. Well, good night, and...
Hey, Kirsten, uh, remember, you can call me for baby advice anytime.
sure.
losers.
I don't understand how you're not drunk.
Oh, it's the Atwood genes. We're built to withstand massive quantities of alcohol.
Ooh. Here we go. Here's the bed. Okay, all right.
now we're just gonna...Whoa. That's good.
but if I can't get you drunk, you'll never tell me you love me.
Oh, Taylor.
I know, I know. Bad Taylor.
I shouldn't have tried to get you drunk.
just like I shouldn't have pretended to be your sleep therapist, or rented Roger the homosexual, or stalked you wearing a Groundhog costume, or...
what else did I do?
I- I think that's it.
I'm going to go to sleep now. Oh.
good-bye, Ryan. It was nice.
are you pretending to go to sleep, thinking I'll tell you I love you while you're unconscious?
maybe.
don't laugh at me.
I'm not.
it's hard dating someone who doesn't tell you how they feel and always having to interpret hand squeezes and...
I love you.
what?
I love you.
you do?
uh, yeah.
I can't believe you just said it.
neither can I.
Oh, I love you, too.
Oh, good.
Yay!
now we can go to Berkeley together.
what? - Yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I got into Berkeley.
I applied, and I got this letter, and put it on my desk and... FOR FLAVOR THAT KEEPS GOING AND GOING,
Ryan Atwood. His face betrays no emotion, but what passions lurk behind those eyes?
answering that is the purpose of this film.
come with me, my friends.
I thought the movie was about the pool.
summer didn't really take to six hours of the pool.
she wanted me to make a movie in which I engage with people.
what is Ryan Atwood wrapping so intently?
Taylor's birthday present.
Ah, Taylor Townsend, the fast-talking Eve Harrington who melted Ryan Atwood's heart.
tell us, Ryan, how does it feel to have Dean Hess's sloppy seconds?
or what did you get her?
either one.
um...
well, uh, one of her hobbies is translating French love poems, so I had them bound for her.
Wow.
that is really romantic.
well, it's, it's not that romantic.
are you kidding?
you may as well tell her you love her.
it's, uh, it's actually a little late for that.
what?
Yeah.
and then what happened?
well, we finished dinner and he still wasn't drunk, so I suggested a drinking game.
I called it "Drink.
whenever I said "drink," we drank.
simple but effective.
Yeah, a little too effective.
I ended up on the coffee table singing "Part of Your World" and telling him he was my Prince Eric.
uh, did he say it?
Yes.
he did?! - Yeah!
Oh, my God, that's amazing. Ow. Ryan told you he loved you.
I know.
I mean, I think he said it.
Yeah, this feeling just kind of came over me and...
I couldn't stop myself.
so why the long face? You regretting it?
well...it turns out she applied to Berkeley without telling me, and now...
your spur-of-the-moment "I love you" is suddenly committing you to four more years.
the plot thickens.
I'm not saying it'd be bad.
it just seems like all of a sudden we're going mach five.
you'd like to turn down the heat a little.
he definitely said it. Absolutely.
I think.
well, don't you think you'd remember?
I don't know; it hurts.
summer, what am I going to do?
I can't just ask him,"Hey, by the way, did you tell me you loved me last night?"
because I was too plastered to remember.
right. Okay.
today's your birthday, right?
and I happen to know that he got you a crazy, romantic present.
so when you open it tonight, why don't you just be like, "Oh, my gosh, Ryan, I love you,and if he said it last night, he'll say it again.
you're a genius.
Yes, I am; it's all up here.
it's just there might be one other tiny little thing.
I'm not saying take it back, but today's her birthday, right?
so she's going to be interpreting every little thing.
so maybe you send her a message.
for instance, that sends the message "You're the only girl in the world for me.
let's move to a co-op in Berkeley.
is that what you want to say?
we go off Ryan Atwood. What will he do?
how will this situation resolve itself?
you said something about Berkeley?
I'm not sure.
maybe I was just talking about him going to Berkeley.
that would make sense, right?
morning, girls. Happy birthday, Taylor.
Thanks, Julie.
Oh, I gave the mailman that letter from the counter.
what letter?
the letter to Berkeley?
Yeah, I think so. - Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Uh-uh! Mister!
mail carrier, sir. Excuse me, please.
um, could you wait?
Hi. I'm sorry.
um, a woman in that house where I live just gave you a letter that she shouldn't have, and, uh, I kind of need it back.
ma'am, once the letter goes in the pouch, it's the property of the Federal government.
okay, and I totally understand that, but if you take that letter,
I am going to lose my place at Berkeley and the chance to be with the man I love and who I think loves me, and, and 15 years from now, when he is trapped in a loveless marriage and I have become a cold, hard ice queen for whom love is no more than a distant memory, it will come down to the fact that on this morning, which coincidentally happens to be my birthday, you obeyed the letter of the law at the expense of simple, human charity.
wow, that was amazing.
can I have my letter now?
Yeah, sure.
Hey.
I didn't know you were a runner.
Yeah, it helps me to work stuff out.
you should try it.
maybe I will. Everything okay?
Yeah. No, I was just, uh, nearby.
I figured I'd stop in and say hello, ask your advice on winning over a 15-year-old Newport girl.
Caitlin giving you trouble?
well, things with Julie are great, and I-I'm so grateful to you and Taylor, but Caitlin, she just- I don't know, she just seems to want to shut me out.
and I know that you have some experience with the Cooper women, so...
well, a Porsche would probably do the trick.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, that's not really in my budget.
well, Caitlin's had a tough year.
you know. Once she sees that her mom's happy, she'll come around.
just be patient.
Ah... suddenly a Porsche sounds like a bargain.
right.
uh, look, I,I got to get going, help set up Taylor's party.
Oh, sure. Is that, is that her present?
Oh, yeah, it's, uh, she translated these French love poems so I had them bound in leather for her.
Oh, my son the romantic. - Yeah.
so I'll, uh, see you tonight.
Yeah.
it's not that romantic.
Taylor, it's going to be fine.
Ryan's going to give you a really romantic present, tell you he loves you, and you guys are going to wind up going to Berkeley together. Don't worry.
okay, yeah, I know. Do you think I should act surprised when I go to the party?
but it's not a surprise party.
well, I know, but it might make Ryan feel good.
okay, it's a great idea.
Ah!
happy birthday! Happy birthday. Happy birthday.
Oh, my God, what a surprise.
Oh, I didn't know it was a surprise party.
just go with it, okay? It's Taylor.
Wow.
happy birthday.
this is a-amazing.
Yeah, well, you deserve it. You got a lot of birthdays to catch up on.
is everything okay?
Yeah, absolutely. Let me get you a drink.
okay.
happy birthday.
thank you. Aw...
happy birthday. - Thank you.
we can move.
I mean it.
Ryan and Seth will be gone in six months.
we could put the house on the market, throw a dart at the map.
maybe it's time.
but this is our home.
so? We'll make some place new our home.
you know? We'll still have our memories.
but when Ryan and Seth come home for the holidays,I want them to come home to that house.
it was an idea.
well, thanks, Sandy.
I just don't think I can.
Oh, my God.
it's a replica of the green destiny sword from Crouching Tiger.
Oh, my God, thank you so much, Seth.
glad you like it. - It's so neat.
open Ryan's present. - Okay. Where is it?
Oh, no, no, no. It's okay.
Ryan's embarrassed.
no, it's just, it's um, personal.
well, I hope so.
Oh, my God. It's a...
it's a dictionary?
that is practical.
Yeah, the guy said that it, um, had more words than others.
well, that's good, being as it is a dictionary.
it's red- that's a cool color.
this GUY LOVES GLOWN PORN !!
I still love him, you know?
I'm sorry, I shouldn't be telling you this.
no, I understand. I worry about him a lot.
you know, I know making this movie just seems so stupid, but I just wanted him to get excited.
just give him a chance.
Seth will find his way.
I hope so.
he just seems a little lost.
those are mine.
what do you think you're doing?
what? The guy likes clown porn. I think everyone should know.
do you have any idea how humiliated Frank would be if he saw this, or if Ryan saw it?
it's his father, Caitlin.
whatever.
do not walk away from me.
I've tried to be understanding.
I'm sorry if Frank isn't as hilarious as Bullit was.
it's not even about that.
then what is it? Is it the money?
mom, look at us.
in the past year we've lost Dad, we've lost Marissa, we had Dr. Roberts and we lost him.
and then we got the Bullit, lost him.
what makes you think that this guy's going to stick around any longer?
Caitlin, am I crazy, or did you say that it was okay for me to date Frank?
Yes, to date him.
but it's been a week and he's practically living in our house.
like he's family. He is not family.
you and I are.
I mean, why can't we just act like that for a little while?
Hey.
they're about to bring out the cake.
everything okay?
Yes, everything's fine.
