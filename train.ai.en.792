fear is the greatest motivator.
Oh, I don't know about that.
look at why you're doing this.
what does that mean?
well, you wanted to protect me.
what are you doing it for?
I wanted to make Campbell happy.
here we go. That must be lesher.
Lesher HIDNAPPER
and the muscle.
the MUSCLE
he better go for it.
if I did all that paperwork for nothing, I'm gonna shoot someone.
when an operative recruits someone, he lets the target make the first move.
he'll dress like him, drink like him, move like him, but he won't talk to him.
he'll wait to be approached.
I'm not sayings he deserved nothing, but half?
I mean, if I'd knownwe were gonna get divorced, I would have had hercome to the office and do half my job, know what I'm saying?
besides, after I pay a lawyer and get a new place, what am I left with?
squat. - Exactly.
you want to hear a funny story about my divorce?
sure. - Me too.
another round --on me.
to my friend at the end of the bar.
I'm not asking for too much, okay?
um, well, just, you know, just come back. That's all I'm asking, but just a wife who doesn't just get on my ass about, you know, "stop drinking" all the time, "come to church" all the time. For Christ's sake.
you know, a decent job, a decent paycheck -- is thattoo much to ask for?
so, you never told me.
what exactly do you do, Brad?
special forces, you know, officer -- 15 years.
now I carry a tennis bag for a spoiled little rich girl.
I work for a bodyguard company.
it's a joke. How about you?
well, it's not too far from your line of work.
I do security testing.
Ah, what a coincidence! You ex-military?
I spent some time in the service, yeah.
you should really think aboutcoming into my side of the biz.
Nah, it's all just B.S. You know?
think about it.
I mean, what kind of training do they do at your company?
when selling yourself as a traitor, you can't be too eager.
a good op will walk away from a recruitment that seems to good to be true.
that's confidential. Why are you asking me these questions?
I'm sorry.
if I want to offer you a job, I should just come out and say so.
I just think it's a shame to see a man with your talents wasted on a job that's beneath him.
if you're interested, give me a call tomorrow.
surveillance is the leading cause of weight gain among operatives.
in a job that's equal parts boredom and tension, eating is a way to pass time and calm nerves.
whatever Carla's up to, Mike, it's something big.
lots of meetings, international types, nobody we know.
if you want to get in her room, now would be the time.
sure, I'll just, uh, teleport myself over there.
or do you have a better suggestion?
you could use this master key.
I cozied up to the housekeeping manager.
Mike, the stuff I had to do to get that, you don't even want to know.
whatever you had to do, it was worth it.
what's the security like in Carla's room?
she's got a facial-recognition computer at the door.
anybody unauthorized sets off an alarm.
that's the room-service guy.
he's authorized.
call me if Carla makes a move and order yourself some dessert. You earned it.
I'm all over it, buddy.
it doesn't have to be food, right?
facial-recognition systems are often used to replace human guards since they're cheap, they don't sleep, and they can't be bribed.
they have a big weakness, though.
unlike guards, computers can't tell the difference between a photocopy of a face and a face.
when you search a spy's room, you don't waste time checking the safe.
you have to assume they're as creative as you are.
slicks come in all shapes and sizes.
Yeah, Sam.
Carla's meeting's wrapping up, Mike. Time to go. Find anything?
we hit the jackpot.
looks like you found Carla's whole file on this operation, Mikey.
Yeah, but the name of the sniper's target is not in there.
well, maybe the supreme overlords haven't given it to her yet.
so if you get it before carla, that might be enough to get you off the blacklist.
worth a try.
well, there's some familiar faces in here.
you know who this is? - No.
maybe he's another operative.
I think we're getting close, Mikey.
well, I got to get back to the hotel.
I'll let you know if she makes a move.
Thanks, Sam.
Hey, go easy on the Mojitos.
they always go easy on me.
the Arroyo family arrived in town yesterday.
you were right.
Lesher asked me to put you on Isabella's security.
you're gonna take her from the house to the country club.
here's your key.
that's your car right out there.
you're doing fine, Henry. Just try to relax.
Lesher's asking for a schedule.
and you're gonna give it to him.
you're gonna keep cooperating with him.
Henry, Lesher's gonna geta whole lot of information about Isabella's security tonight, and he's not gonna like what he hears.
there's an art to drinking without getting drunk.
start with a lot of ice to dilute the alcohol.
order a new round before you're done so your half-full drink gets taken away.
and, of course, spill.
no -- no worries. I got it.
you want to talk business, let's talk business.
Yeah, we deal with high-end clients.
we're always looking for good people... like you.
I know your time's valuable, so I'll make it worth your while to hear me out.
a thousand bucks.
just for considering my offer.
here's the deal, Brad.
if I'm gonna hire you, I need to see you in action.
and I know it's against regulations, but I'm in a bit of a bind here.
you got to work with me a little.
check me out tomorrow when I drive little miss sunshine to her tennis match.
but be careful that you're not seen.
they always hire extra security.
extra security aside from you?
they got two more guys locked an loaded -- watchers watching the watchers.
can you believe that? For one girl.
two more cars. Seriously?
see for yourself.
they got more money than sense. Another drink. Another drink?
why not?
princess.
this job sounds good.
Hey, do you think you could drop me off at the Hilton?
I got kicked out of --you know, amanda -- she kicked me outof staying there.
can you... - yeah, no problem. No problem.
Yeah. All right.
a cover I.D. That involves drinking comes with a price.
but the tactical advantages make the hang over worth it.
how'd it go with lesher?
told him about the security, and I got a bug in his car.
time for a demonstration of Isabella's air-tight detail.
Sam's in the buick. Who's the other member of our little team?
I was thinking about calling Nate.
I was hoping you couldmonitor the bug from here.
you're asking your brother for help on the job?
I'm trying to be supportive.
fi... is that my last yogurt?
there's some tuna tahini in the oven.
your favorite.
Campbell made it.
he's so grateful you're helping Henry.
you know me --anything for Campbell.
by the way, you never told me what you thought of him.
Oh, no, I told you.
no, he's nice.
I'm just gonna go outand pick up some yogurt. Be right back.
Hello?
Carla, so good to hear from you.
I got an interesting report today.
someone used a key card to get into a certain office building.
know anything about that?
key card? All the key cards I had, I gave to you.
is that so?
but if I hear anything, you're my first call.
let me get a pen. What's your number?
word of advice -- there are things in the works that are far, far over your head.
stay out of them or there will be consequences.
you know me --good little soldier.
good night, Michael.
Mike, you want some of these?
they got plenty of them. Mints, too.
I mean, they keep restocking the room. It seems a shame to waste them.
so I tried to get ears on her with the directional Mike, but whenever they're out in the open, it's just small talk.
she's good at what she does.
so she called you, huh?
do you think she knows anything?
maybe. Maybe not. It doesn't change much.
we still have to watch and learn.
at least she's locked down tight here.
tight enough that I can borrow you to be my extra bodyguard?
Yeah, sure, if we make it quick.
I can get back before she's done swimming.
at least try the shampoo, Mike.
it smells really good.
welcome. - Thank you.
I got to be honest with you, bro.
I didn't expect you to call me with a limo job.
you didn't seem too hot on the idea.
as someone who has lent you money in the past, I was a little concerned.
I'm not gonna screw this up, Mike. I want you to know that.
I'm turning things around.
all right, so I just drive up the street, and then I look at youand some girl.
are you sure that's all you want me to do?
that's it. Just sit there and don't smile.
not exactly what I expected for my first job.
it's more important than taking people to the airport. Trust me.
you know what?
I'm gonna frame this.
well, maybe I'm gonna break this up into smaller bills and frame one of them.
but, uh...
Thanks, Mike.
operatives do a lot of bodyguard work.
on any given day, the average commando is more likely to be watching a V.I.P. walk his dog than engaging the enemy in battle.
not glamorous, but part of the job.
you're...
thanks for drive me.
no problem. No, uh... problemo.
so serious.
how was tennis? -Fine.
what's wrong, Fi?
I'm listening to the bug in Lesher's car.
they were impressed with the extra security, but this is more than a kidnapping for money. Listen.
it doesn't matter. It does matter!
they got both sides of the street covered! The plan was that...
I know what the plan was!
but the people that paid for this job have a multinational oil concession riding on us getting that girl.
we have to find a way.
sounds like Lesher needs a little more convincing.
Michael, you don't have to
Fi...we both know I have to.
did you see me in action today?
Yeah, I saw you. -Yeah, and how many others?
I mean, you could send a delta force team after that kid, and you wouldn't even scratch her tennis racket.
I mean, it's a waste of my time.
uh, when can istart with you? -Yeah, we need to talk.
can we start talking about salary?
cause if I'm gonna make a move, I got to give notice. Who's your friend?
that's what this talk's about, my man. -What are you doing?
you want a new job? I'll give you a new job.
you're gonna help us take the girl.
no, no, no. - Yes, yes, yes, yes, Brad!
you cashed my check.
how's that gonna look for your company? Or to the cops?
I own you, Brad. You're mine.
Oh, god! I can't do this.
we just need the girl.
you need to get her away from the other security team.
you're gonna get her isolated, hand her over to us, and you can walk away.
I-I-I can't do that.
you need to do as you're told, or life's gonna get real short real quick for your ex and your kids up in Orlando.
now, do you understand me?
Yeah. I understand.
thought you would.
just hold still.
so, what's happening?
Lesher's gonna take Isabella?
I thought there was a plan.
this isn't just a snatch-and-grab for kidnapping insurance.
someone's putting the pressure on her father's oil business. There's a lot at stake.
so that's it?
I mean, he's just gonna take her, and there's nothing we can do?
uh, it's trickier now, Henry, but I'm hoping I can still get him to call it off.
how?
well, if lesher thinks Michael's gonna blow the job, go to the cops, then hopefully he'll decide there's no way he can pull it off.
but he said he'd kill you.
I know.
I just have to make him believe that I don't care.
have you been drinking?
a little. A little.
I just -- I can't sleep, and with my divorce and now what's, what's going on with this, it's -- I just can't take much more of it.
would you shut up and pay attention?
I'm gonna be parked right there.
you bring that girl out of the club five minutes early, and we'll grab her before the other security team gets here.
what if she runs?
she's not gonna run. We're gonna drug her, all right?
day after tomorrow, she'll be out of the country.
well, what about the other security detail showing up early?
just make sure they don't, Brad.
if anything happens...
I mean anything, you're dead.
anybody who runs a few assets knows that some crack under the pressure.
you have to be tough enough to keep them in line, supportive enough to keep them stable.
let me help you with that.
I don't know if I can do it.
I-I just... -Here you go.
I-I don't think it's in me.
it's a piece of cake, man. It's a piece of cake.
just buck up. - No, no, I-I-I can'T.
you just -- - Brad!
trust me. This is not my thing.
go home. Sober up.
you can do this. Here's your top.
Yeah, Sam?
Yeah, Mike, I got some news.
you know how my FBI buddy was tracking Carla's sniper, running his cards?
Yeah.
well, the bar crawl is over. He's back in town.
and our girl Carla has had a very busy meeting schedule this morning, so I think the sniper's gonna be doing his thing soon.
keep me posted.
will do.
and, Mike, you better wrap up this kidnapper business, eh?
I'm trying, Sam. I'm trying.
when someone turns you into an asset, their main weapon is fear.
is Brad the security guard ready to change his life?
just about.
if you fear poverty or exposure or death, that's what they use against you.
their worst nightmare, then, is an asset with no fear.
Lesher, it's Brad.
are you drunk?
why are you calling me now?
it's 3: 00 in the morning. What the hell are you.
I'm not doing it.
I'm not helping you kidnap that girl.
what? Brad, we went over this.
I couldn't sleep tonight.
so I came down, I started watching tv, and there was this bible program on.
and it was like -- it was likethey were speaking to me.
and suddenly I realized for the first time, you know? I saw.
wait. What -- the Bible?
they said this thing as iron sharpens iron, so man sharpens another man.
and I realized, proverbs 27: 17.
that's you and me.
you showed me the way.
have you been drinking?
no, I'm done with that.
no more drinking. No more hate.
you, guys at work, my ex-wife -- you're all angels sent to test me.
what are you talking about? Brad.
the kidnapping --I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not gonna help you kidnap that girl.
I see that now. It was all a test.
Brad, listen to me!
you breathe one word of this, and you're dead.
don't you see I'm not afraid?
I'm not afraid anymore. I'm not afraid of death. I'm not afraid of anything.
I'm free.
we should meet.
listen to me carefully, Brad.
you're in this.
you're a part of this already.
if this gets out, I will be punished. I know.
I accept that.
what is this? A confession?
it's my sins -- our sins.
like they say, "yea, though I walk through the valley ofthe shadow of death...
shut up! Shut up! Shut up! - ..."I will fear no evil.
I will fear no evil, for you are with me.
you want to kill me, kill me. Do it. Do it. I deserve it. I deserve it.
and all these people will bear witness to my sacrifice.
I am ready to be judged.
forget it.
forget it. Forget it. We call it off.
it was a test, all right?
I'm an angel, I was testing you, and you passed.
just go home. It's over.
blowing an operation is a delicate business.
you have to convince your opponent to abandon his plans, make a case that the smart move is to just pack up and go home.
problem is, even when you do your job well, people don't always go with the smart move.
Lesher sent you to kill me, didn't he?
well, then, you need to make a phone call.
you're gonna tell him you did the job, but you got hurt and you had to go to the hospital.
then... you're gonna spend a little time in your trunk.
how does that sound? Hold that thought.
yeah?
Michael, it's Henry.
I just got a call from Lesher.
the kidnapping's on for this afternoon.
he made me assign a new security guard.
he's going to kill the guy, and he wants me to help him.
I'm supposed to meet them at the country club.
I get the guard away from Isabella, saying that there's, there'sa mix-up at headquarters, and then Lesher, he drives up, he's gonna grab her while the other guy shoots the guard!
I'm not gonna let that happen. Calm down.
calm down?
I'm supposed to meet him in half an hour.
and you still will.
Henry, Lesher still has to believe you're cooperating.
if you try anything right now, he's got every reason to kill you and no reason to keep you alive.
I don't think I can -- - yes, you can. Listen to me.
I'm gonna take care of this.
you just do what they say. And when you see me, Henry, run.
run... when I see you.
when you see me. - Okay.
you ready?
they're gonna be here soon.
I still don't like this. I mean, what do you...
you don't have to like it. You just have to do it.
she's here.
who is that? Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
get her inside now!
go!
you thought you could kill me?
I gave you a chance to be redeemed!
but you turned your back!
these are your sins, Lesher, here on this paper!
do you hear them coming?
they will find everything you've brought to kidnap that poor girl!
and you will be judged!
I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't responded to that 911 call.
thank you. Really.
they did all the heavy lifting, so...
well, whoever Lesher was working for must have been pretty disappointed.
I heard he tripped and fellon a knife last night in jail.
he fell on a knife?
you're safe, Henry.
but I'd keep your mouth shut about all of this.
no problem. The family's keeping this really quiet.
they're really stepping up the security.
Oh, Isabella -- she's been asking why you're not around anymore.
what do I tell her?
tell her Brad the security guard had to take some time off for some personal issues.
so, what do you think of Campbell? You still haven't told me.
why is it so important what I think about your boyfriend?
cause I want you to like him.
I'm happy that he makes you happy.
give me a real answer, Michael. Saved by the phone.
Yeah, ma?
Madeline: Michael, what is going on?
what do you mean? What's wrong?
there are cops here, and they're arresting your brother!
ma, I didn't do anything! I swear! Tell him.
they said it's about this limo company, t-that I-it's some kind of a front laundering money or something. It's ridiculous!
tell him not to say anything.
Michael, I got a call from some woman.
a-and she said that --that nate is in serious trouble.
I could lose my house.
and -- and she said, Michael, to tell you that you should stay out of other people's business.
her name was, um, Carla.
I'm gonna call you back.
Sam, is Carla there?
just about to call you, brother.
something's up. She's on the move.
I need a ride.
well, there's our mystery operative.
any idea what's going on, Sam?
no, she just checked out of the hotel and came over here. That's it.
just say the word, Michael. I have a nice rifle in the trunk of my car.
tempting, but since she's the only one who knows what's going on, I might want to keep her alive.
there's a reason they call the spy trade the hall of mirrors.
you can never know for sure whether you're in control or you're being played.
but if you do it long enough, you learn to trust your instincts.
it's a setup.
what? -What are you saying?
she knows we're here.
she's gonna have her sniper take his target out now.
she wants me here watching when it happens.
how can you be sure, Mike?
I can't, but it's how I would do it.
last ferry's in an hour.
if I can get home and get that access card, I can get to the sniper before he takes his shot.
sounds good. I'll get to his house, see if I can catch him there.
still leaves me free to shoot Carla.
just saying.
as soon as I leave, they'll be on me. Can you?
Yes, I can.
unlike cars, motorcycles don't have much of an aftermarket in stolen parts.
so antitheft measures are outdated and easy to get around.
the steering lock on a smaller bike breaks fairly easily.
then it's just a matter of getting away.
go.
when you're tailed by multiple vehicles, you're at a disadvantage.
they can flank you, take alternate routes, box you in.
it helps to have a team of you're own.
the electronic stability program was originally developed to help keep cars from sliding on icy roads.
but it's a great tool for the precision driver.
when you need to slide, you can simply turn it off and turn it on again when you need to maneuver.
a semi has about 4 feet of clearance under it.
sliding beneath it on a motorcycle is possible, but risky.
too low, and the pavement will grind you to a pulp.
too high, and any part of your body that hits the trailer will no longer be part of your body.
Yeah, Sam?
I'm home. Did you make it to the sniper's house?
Yeah, I got some news, Mikey. The sniper's dead.
dead? Why would anyone...
I don't know, but it's pretty nasty.
something is very wrong.
I don't get what's going on.
they went to a lot of trouble to put this guy in place.
slow down. Just tell me.
what happened, Sam? How?
someone booby-trapped his front door, Mike.
they blew him up.
I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing...
no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
should we shoot them?
an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies --a bunch of bitchy little girls.
family, too...
Hey, is that your mom again?
if you're desperate.
someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line -- until you figure out who burned you, you're not going anywhere.
someone out there wants you dead, and we both need to know who.
you're really gonna do this? Hunt them down?
the enemy of my enemy could be my friend.
I got the chemical analysis back from the explosion. Professional.
any progress finding our bomber?
Nope. Checked the blast. Crude I. E.D. Amateur hour.
we recruited you because you're a good liar.
I guess we can't complain too much when you lie to us.
your bombers couldn't go out the front door after they set it.
if they went off the balcony...
I could checkthe security cameras at the businesses along the river.
when you work for an intelligence agency, you operate within an official structure.
there's a chain of command to report to, protocols to be observed.
no one questions their mission.
but when you freelance, you don't have those luxuries.
getting your team on board may require some convincing.
I don't have a problem with hunting down someone who planted a bombat your place.
I have a problem with why you're hunting him.
if this was about revenge, I'd be fine with it.
revenge is a waste of time.
well, so is watching TVANTS and eating candy.
you do it'cause it feels good.
you are finding a killer for the people who ruined your life.
when I find him, I'll have more on them.
Ah, intelligencec gathering -- right.
he should at least suffer a little.
well, when I find him, there will be some pain involved. Are you happy?
delighted.
do you see that storage facility?
it has security cameras that cover the approach to your loft from the road.
here's the name of the service rep who installed the security system.
and the model number. You're welcome.
you do care.
now run along before I change my mind.
spies love technology upgrades.
when someone replaces old equipment -- a computer, a cellphone, a pda.
getting information becomes as easy as looking through the trash.
I cannot believe Phil didn't call you.
I was up on an install up in Boca.
they had me come down here and do your service upgrade. I got the paperwork right here.
is it gonna takea long time?
no, it shouldn't be too long. It's just a simple switch-out of a unit.
well, I should check with them.
no. You should yell at them, is what you should do. I'm gonna get started here.
when you need to steal information in a hurry, just arrange the technology upgrade yourself.
Ron, it's Kay, at Evergreen.
Yeah. There's a guy here doing an upgrade, but I don't have him on the schedules.
hang on. I'm on with Ron Lummer. He said he needs to speak to you.
Yeah, Ron? - Yeah. Who is this?
no, no, no. You're lookingin the wrong files. It's Evergreen storage.
it's on your desk by the bobble-head guy. - What are you talking about? I don't have a file.
you found it?
Oh, it looks like Phil dropped the ball on this one.
I'm calling the police right now.
no, no, no, no. Don't be too hard on him. Everybody makes mistakes.
you're breaking the law. Don't touch anything.
you know me, Ron. Anything for you. Just save me a donut! - This isn't funny! You hear me?
you're going to jail! I'm...
what did he say?
well, somebody's in trouble, but it ain't me.
all right, sorry for the inconvenience.
if you need to buy a few seconds in an office environment, programming a computer to dial every phone in an office simultaneously is simple and cheap.
just set up your cellphone to trigger the call remotely.
sounds like you guys are busy.
to get away clean from an office, it's okay to run.
people run out of offices all the time.
if the look on your face says "I'm in a hurry," you can go as fast as you want.
it's all about covering ground before the yelling starts.
Hey, stop!
the one you love is closer than you think.
what's yours say?
the one who burned you is closer than you think.
what? What?
Oh, that got your attention.
not funny, Fi.
is this what your life's become, Michael?
running around like Carla's errand boy?
I'm doing this so I can get out from under Carla.
the guy who blew me up --she hates him.
so I would like to meet him.
I think I found something.
passed the camera twice in 90 minutes the day of the bombing.
right time, too.
collapsible ladder for getting down from your balcony.
city worker outfit keeps people from asking questions.
meet the man who tried to kill me.
kind of ordinary for a spy killer.
what were you expecting?
I don't know. You know, after all this, like, boots and a mask, at least.
you know, a cape, maybe?
his gear is from city of Miami public works.
capes aren't standard issue.
Fi's checking it out.
Hey, good news -- something to take your mind off all this.
I got a way to score some dolphins tickets.
Sam... - come on, Mikey.
when's the last time you did something that regular people do?
don't be afraid. I'll be right there with you.
50-yard line, third row, beer in big plastic cups.
how are we getting these tickets?
buddy of mine -- Sean Martin.
he used to play for the Dphins in the '90s.
he, um -- he needs a little favor.
and there it is. - Yeah, well, come on.
look, we can probably wrap this up in a day.
we're supposed to meet him at 2: 00.
most of these guys I handpicked in the roughest part of overtown.
pulled them out of broken families, gangs. Put them on the field.
see, Mike? He's a great humanitarian, and he's got tickets on the 50-yard line.
Sam said you had a problem.
not me. One of my players -- Corey Jensen.
good kid -- stays out of trouble, but he got into a fight the other day.
a fight? What about?
not sure. I just know the guy he fought is bad news.
Felix Cole, a local gangster.
word is -- he wants Corey dead.
gangster -- this is the little problem you.
yeah -- hey, Sean, what exactly were you hoping for here, favor-wise?
he's at my place with his sister.
I just wanted you guys to go by and talk to him and see what the options are.
well, if he's being hunted, he shouldn't be staying at your place.
won't be long before they look there.
Mike's right. Look, let me swing by. I'll pick them up.
Thanks, Sam. I appreciate it.
okay, so it's not a little problem, but we're not exactly talking nosebleed seats either here, huh? Come on.
whoa, Mike. We got a visitor.
Hello, Michael. Is now a good time?
Carla. So great to see you.
you might want to give Sam your keys. We need to talk.
I'll meet you back at the loft. - You sure, Mike?
he's sure.
don't I get tied to the chair? Don't go soft on me now, Carla.
I thought we'd keep this meetinga little more casual.
we want to know how your investigation is going.
"we"? Who's "we"? Love to meet the team, if they're around!
Michael, sit down.
we got our analysis back of the explosives at your place.
same method and materials used on the other operatives that were attacked.
"Operatives." Plural. How many exactly? Do I get names?
no.
I thought you weren't going to tie my hands.
I've seen your work.
you do just fine with your hands tied.
everything I can share with you is here.
and it stays here. Look it over, let us know when you're done.
what if I have to goto the little boys room?
well, you're gonna have to hold it.
my men have orders to shoot you if you try to leave the room.
Hey, Mike.
well, that was a quickie.
you look... unbruised.
just a few paper cuts.
I got a look at Carla's files.
she thinks the bomberis not local.
Oh, so the big, bad burn-notice lady's a step behind you.
you think it's gonna stay that way?
well, I asked for a list of all demolition experts who have spent time in Serbiaand Montenegro.
said I saw a pattern there.
Yeah, we got another meeting on the books.
nice. Fi's upstairs with the kids.
I'm just heading out to get dinner for everybody.
pizza time? - Yeah.
uh, Mike, just a heads-up.
this one has Fi a little... fired up.
sorry. I was, uh, delayed.
Oh, that's okay, Michael. I was getting to know your guests.
I'm -- I'm Corey. This is my little sister, Tanya.
I'm Michael. - Nice to meet you.
they told me about their situation.
it seems this man --Felix?
he took Tanya for a ridein his car...
and then he attacked her.
and she escaped, barely, and then Corey went after him with a baseball bat.
I found her cryingin the street.
I just wanted to make sure he never tried to come back...
no explanation necessary.
use a golf club next time.
greater force to a smaller area.
um, yeah. But now he's after me.
his guys cameto my house. They tried to shoot me in the street.
I mean, I don't know where to go.
it's fine. We'll take care of it.
would you excuse me?
Fiona, could I talk with you out on the balcony?
Michael, I'm gonna say this once.
we are helping these kids.
Fi, this is a job for the police.
Oh, sure. If we let Felix kill Corey, we'll have more evidence when he comes after this girl again.
you made your point. We can get them out of town.
no. They've done nothing wrong. They're not going anywhere.
that sick son of a bitch is going somewhere, and this is not a discussion.
Fiona, you're letting your emotions get the best of you.
no. I'm doing better than that.
I'm letting my feelings run the show, and I feel very strongly about this!
Felix works out of that club, mostly.
his crew boosts cars for the 24k syndicate.
that's him next to the gto.
man, what was I thinking?
he's a stone-cold gangster.
no, he doesn't deserve to be called a gangster.
anyone who attacks a 15-year-old is a pervert.
see, the thing is, ever since the word went out, his whole gang is after me --the whole 24k crew.
the whole 24k crew.
Oh, this is getting better and better.
you see that guy he's talking to?
the guy with the glasses by the table?
that's Tony Soto, the boss.
Felix earns a lot of money for that guy.
any car that gets boosted from here to midtown, it's his guys.
listen, seriously, I don't think there's anything you guys can do.
Oh, don't worry, Corey.
there's a long list of things we can do.
you know, just for the record, when I said "favor,"
I was thinking, like, find somebody's lost dog or something like that.
you're gonna have to work a little harder than you're used to.
I work plenty hard, lady. I just make it look easy.
Corey's up against an organization here, Fi.
Felix is well-connected.
well, then we'll just have to disconnect him, won't we?
Tony won't back Felix if we put him out of business.
a new gang of car thievesis coming to town.
you want to take him head-on?
well, then we got to stash Corey and his sister, Tanya, somewhere for a bit.
Yep.
Corey and Tanya are getting settled, and I'm making Spaghetti. Excuse me.
ma, I'm sorry.
Fiona really felt strongly about them being in a nicer environment than the loft, and, uh...
well, you know, she -- she was really not in the mood to discuss the point.
it's fine. If you didn't bring people over, I'd never see you.
Oh, and thank you for what you did for your brother.
for -- for what?
your brother's papers. When he got out of jail?
the arrest was erased, like it never happened. You didn't do that?
not exactly. It was, uh --it was done for me.
well, thank your friends for me, then.
Yeah, my friends put him in jail in the first place, actually, so...
sometimes I forget how complicated your life is.
there's a reason armies wear uniforms, even though they make them easier to spot.
sometimes that's what you want.
uniforms suggest organization, power, and numbers.
these, in turn, inspire fear.
and as any good operative knows, there's no more effective weapon than fear.
nice car.
it's too bad, really.
what's too bad?
pepper grenades are used by antiterrorist units to disable and stun.
not lethal, but a face full of pepper gas will keep you pretty busy.
no, no, no. Don't go anywhere. The party's just starting.
what the hell, man?
No!
melting through the engine block of a car isn't hard if you know what you're doing.
a few pounds of thermite in a coffee can and a fuse will do the trick and put on a pretty good show.
Felix. Felix. Felix, over here.
it's time for you to leave Miami.
you what? You did that to his car?
he's gonna come after you.
better than him coming after you.
we're just sending him a message -- it's time for him to move on.
Yeah, sounds like it. Damn.
Oh, I looked through those pictures mr. Axe gave to me.
you recognize anyone?
Yeah, this dude here is J. B.
he's definitely big-time.
that's Rodrick.
and this dude here? They call Reed.
these three are Felix's main boosters.
I found some crackers.
mom?
these are like cardboard.
well, they were in the back of the cupboard. They're a few years old.
Corey's been helping me clean out all of the old food in the house.
he ate a can of smoked oysters that I've had since you were a baby.
a little salty, but they really hit the spot. Thanks, Ms. Westen.
Oh, no. Thank you.
can we go home now?
not yet. This was a good first step, but we stil lhave to be careful.
is there any family that you have that Felix might know about?
no. It's just me and Tanya.
our mom passed last year.
we got family up north.
but I need to finish school here.
I got a chance at a scholarship.
coach Martin looks after us if we need it.
well, I think it's time to talk to coach Martin.
the whole neighborhood's talking about what happened with Felix yesterday.
the engine of his carmelted into the road? It's crazy.
Yeah, well, crazy'sBkind of what you want in a situation like this.
I mean, you want Felix to worry about something that's bigger than some kid beating him up.
sounds like a plan to me.
if there's anything I can do to help...
Yeah, actually, I need you to keep your head down for a while, cause this is gonna get worse before it gets better.
Sam, you're asking me to hide?
hide? Oh, no, no, no. Of course not.
I just need youto be some place where no one can see you.
until I give the all-clear.
you know, for the kids.
when you need to get into a building in a hurry, you can always count on a fire exit.
every building has them.
it's just about knowing how to use them.
the right shape charge will put a big enough dent in a steel door to disengage the lock, which can turn a fire exit into a convenient and unexpected entrance.
a coil of detcord attached to a rubber mat will give you the explosion you need and allow you to point it wherever you need it to go.
s. W. A. T.Teams call it a hockey puck.
let me do that.
I have a more delicate touch.
I made some progress finding your would-be assassin today.
Yeah. There's a chance he worksat A. S. A. Dismantling.
the city contracts their demolition work with them.
I think I'll pay him a visit, see what I can find out.
it's beautiful. - Yeah.
beautiful.
so, the front of the placeis pretty well guarded, but that's it.
and Felix?
he hangs around the back. He's there now.
fresh from the printer. - Shall we?
I want to know who the hell they are!
they come out of nowhere, destroy my car, tell me to leave my home, and you say nobody --nobody knows anything?
no, Felix. Nobody's seen nothing.
then maybe they're not looking hard enough.
"Blitzkrieg," or "lightning war" was a strategy pioneered by the germans in world war II.
it refers to a fast attack designed to inspire fear and confusion, penetrating quickly behind enemy lines.
good afternoon. Let's get those hands up.
I'll thank you to back up against the wall. Keep your hands where I can see 'em.
nice. Comfortable?
Hello, Felix.
who the hell are you people?
the name's Johnny.
we got a lot in common, Felix.
we're bothin the car-theft game.
only we work Miami, and you -- well, you work someplace else.
you have 48 hours. After that, we'll make your travel arrangements for you.
leave town?
I'm supposed to be scared of some fancy-ass suits and a shotgun?
you better get the hell out of my establishment.
I hear you. You're busy. You got a lot to do.
after all, you only have...
47 hours, 59 minutes... and 10 seconds...
left. Trust me, Felix. You want to move on.
you got a lot of headaches here you don't need.
Miami is very humid in the summer, and you got all these people you have to manage.
plus your place is on fire.
I'll kill you!
take care.
you hear me? Do you hear me?
did you see the shopping list your mother gave sam?
Corey is eating his own body weight in cereal every day.
he's a growing boy.
I have to say, I like this Johnny. He's got flair.
he reminds me of your cover in Dublin when we first met.
do you remember what you called yourself?
sometimes I wonder if...
he's the one I fell in love with.
I wouldn't be surprised.
we caused a lot of mayhem, you and I.
he was your type of guy.
Yes, he was. Where did he go?
Oh, you know how it is with cover I. D.S.
you become who you need to be.
and everyone gets to guess who you really are.
I'll see you later, Michael.
I have an appointment at A. S. A. Dismantling and demolition.
Fi, if you see this guy,
I'll give him a kiss from you.
are you Eric? - Yeah.
Nina Roberts, Green Row publishing. We spoke on the phone yesterday.
Oh, right. you sell the calendars.
no, darling. I make the calendars.
theme calendars. Firefighters, lumberjacks, cops, cowboys...
and now the men of demolition.
nothing turns a woman on more than when something goes "boom."
all I need from you are names and photos of all your...
demolition guys --do me a favor.
don't tell them you're doing it.
why is that?
well, no feelings get hurt if I just talk to the guys I'm interested in.
all I need is another homely firefighter offering to wax his chest in my office.
so, um... what do you look for?
depends.
but I think I'm looking at Mr. January right here.
target selection is one of the least glamorous but most important elements in any strategy.
you want to take out the people your opponent depends on
the ones his organization can't function without.
lose your keys?
I can give you a ride.
don't look so scared.
loaded it with a bean-bag round, so it won't do any permanent damage.
but the temporary damage --that hurts like hell.
did I forget to mention that?
my fault. My fault.
maybe we should exchange insurance information.
or maybe you should put these on...
and get into the trunk of my car.
Yeah. You see? Look.
there's an element of theater in any offensive campaign.
it's not just about bullets and bodies
killing people usually creates more problems than it solves.
it's about undermining your enemy's will to fight, destroying the morale of his troops, sending the message that fighting back is useless because the battle is already lost.
I brought you a little going-away present.
you call this a present? - Yeah. They're alive.
Yeah, but you won't be.
I'm good to go if you are.
you really want to do this in front of all these people in broad daylight?
you just wait, Johnny boy.
Oh, I'll wait.
I'll wait 23 hours and 14 minutes.
clean this up, man!
Yeah. - Hello, Johnny.
this is Tony Soto. Maybe you've heard of me?
you're Felix's boss. Yeah.
there's a car coming up the street.
I see it.
I want to talk to you.
well, go ahead and talk. That's what phones are for.
no. In person. Get in the car.
get in the car.
I'm new to Miami, but are most people that stupid here?
I'll leave two of my guys with your people, unarmed, to guarantee your safety.
and I'm not asking. I'm telling.
now get in.
keep these boys company.
I'm going to meet Tony Soto.
there's an old saying in war that no plan survives the battlefield.
often, as a situation evolves, you create new enemies.
sometimes you create new alliances, new friends.
soldiers are fine for dealing with the enemies, but you need a spy to handle new friends.
behold the ghost haunting Felix Cole.
where you from?
around. Why am I here?
you got style, Johnny.
you're aggressive.
boom -- I like that.
nice to be appreciated.
Felix has beena good earner, but any guy who lets someone punk him like you did, lets a 17-year-old kick his ass with a baseball bat...
well, I can't have that kind of weakness in my house.
I couldn't agree more.
which brings me to my question -- what exactly do you want?
my team doesn't like competition.
we want to be the only game in town.
we're selfish that way.
I'm selfish this way -- nobody operates in this neighborhood without dealing with me.
I'll deal with you. Listen, Felix is an amateur.
he steals a few cars for sale and lays the rest off in chop shops.
go to a high school. A kid can do that. Us?
we deal in high-end export -- shipping them overseas at a markup.
overseas? How do you get the cars through customs?
we clean 'em and clone 'em. Untraceable.
sell them at twice the price.
now, I can't have these idiots running around, boosting minivans with a shimand a screwdriver.
you can talk, Johnny. I'm gonna give you that.
but let's see if you can deliver.
hot off the street. Bring it back clean. Show me how it works.
you could be my new car man.
Felix is out?
Felix is out, or you are.
so, this is your job application?
more or less.
so, meanwhile, some poor guy's running around, looking for his $150, 000 car.
Yeah, we'll get it back to him. We got to move fast on this one, sam.
Yeah. No kidding. You know, I went to Felix's place earlier to do some surveillance.
he's been going nuts since we did our thing.
well, the more panicked he is, the easier our job is.
Yeah, but you know, this isn't just business, Mike.
I mean, he put the word out to every kid in the neighborhood to look for Corey.
that was the plan. We made him look vulnerable.
with Tony breathing down his neck, he has to look strong now.
quit yapping. Let's go.
the actual theft of a car isn't difficult.
the hard part is selling it once you have it.
between the license, registration, tax records, and vin number, it's surprisingly hard to turn a car into cash.
the best approach is to start with clean paperwork on another car from out of state, then match the stolen car to the clean paperwork.
that means new vin tags and a new registration.
and in case someone decides to check close, some hydrochloric acid and a file will make the etched vin number on the car chassis impossible to read.
well, that's it.
so, Mike, you think I should drive around south beach, you know, just to make sure it still drives okay?
knock yourself out. I've got a meeting.
okay. Say hi to Carla for me.
Hello, Michael.
Hello, Carla.
do we have to go all the way to your office, or can we just do this here?
everybody who's ever blown something up in Eastern Europe.
your ex-girlfriend's on there.
I think we can rule Fiona out.
Really? She has the expertise, and she certainly had access.
lot of names here. This could take some time.
two days. Driver.
I could get started that much faster if you just dropped me off at home.
go up, make a left, make an-- - goodbye, Michael.
Aw, man. Look at that sweater.
what?
Yeah. That was Christmas.
Oh, Michael must haveVbeen 15, I think.
God, don't they look cute? So sweet.
must be nice.
me and Corey -- we never had a family like that.
neither did we, sweetheart.
see the bruise on Michael's cheek?
he and his father got into a fight because Frank was...
pushing his brother around.
anyway, nobody was talking to anybody, so I said, "I'm gonna throw the whole dinner down the garbage,
unless they stood there and took that picture.
he fought his dad on --on Christmas?
he was being a good big brother.
like you.
is that everyone? - Yep.
past and present.
Oh, look who's on top.
I'll schedule photo sessions in a few weeks, once I've had time to go over all this.
cool.
remember...
I'll be waiting.
Michael, I believeI found your bomber.
who is it, Fi?
his name is Derek Poole, and he works part-timefor A. S. A.
I guess we know what he does with the rest of his time.
can you get a home address?
what do you think?
what's the word?
fi got a name.
you expecting somebody, Mike? - Nope.
who's there?
what happened?
Felix and his boys jumped me.
they said if I didn't set up a meeting with Corey, they would go after my players.
he said he just wanted to talk to him.
no. He's going to kill him. He'll probably kill you both.
should we call the police?
well, we could get Felix arrested for assaulting you, but his crew would still beon the streets, and corey would still be in danger.
so, what are we going to do, guys? 'Cause I can't have this guy going after my players.
Felix is on the edge. It's time to push him over.
you're gonna call him. Set up the meeting.
it's all right. We've done this before.
so, this address was got from Felix? It's an alley.
industrial areaby midtown.
perfect spot for an ambush? - Bingo.
you won yourself a beer, Mikey.
so, poked around.
looks like this guy Felix is kind of a one-trick pony when it comes to hits.
a few years ago, one of his rivals got popped.
same setup, different alley.
if something works... - yeah.
basically, car pulls in, bad guys box him in, hose him down with lead.
well, this I can work with.
can I, uh, work with that? Thank you.
there are a couple of ways to make a vehicle bullet-resistant.
$60, 000 worth of titanium siding will do the job.
or you can pick up a few extra copies of the yellow pages from your local phone company.
most non-armor-piercing bullets will only penetrate a phone book to a depth of an inch or two.
behind a layer of steel, it's more like a quarter of an inch.
commercially available foam sealants will keep your tires rolling long enough to get you out of danger.
for the windows -- dual-layer, high-density plexiglas is your best bet.
it's expensive, but bullet-proof glass is not the sort of thing you skimp on.
my guy called the cops. It checks out clean.
you could drive it tothe police station yourself, and you wouldn't have to worry about it.
I must say, I'm impressed. - We aim to please.
all right. Let's check out this operation of yours.
Let'go.
I figured you for a nicer ride.
we don't like to take anything flashy to our location.
we can't afford to attract attention.
you're careful. That's good.
maybe a little crazy, but you're careful.
and when it counts. Now, about Felix...
don't worry about him.
this checks out, I'll take care of Felix.
countless wars have been fought over misunderstanding
tragic mistakes, misperceptions that turn people against each other forever.
that's Corey's car. Let's do this.
of course, it's not so tragic when you're the one creating the misunderstanding.
it's up here. We operate out of a warehouse. We do all our work there.
nothing's in our name, so there's no connection to us.
Johnny, is that Felix's car?
you tell Felix you were meeting us?
no, I...
well, then why the hell is he here? He's got a gun.
get down!
get us the hell out of here!
we got to ditch this thing.
you can call your guys for a ride?
Yeah, yeah. Jesus. How did we...?
we armored the car. We're crazy, but we're not stupid.
you know, that son of a bitch, he -- - yeah, about that.
you have a few things to straighten out before we get into business together.
Yeah, I'd say so.
I think we're gonna leave Miami for a little while. Let it cool down.
give you time to clean house.
you straighten out this thing with Felix.
Oh, I'll straighten it out.
there's our ride. We'll give you a call when it's time.
I want you to get big Edon the phone.
I'm gonna take care of this cat.
Felix cleared out of Miami soon as he heard Tony was looking for him.
his whole crew left, too.
Yeah, it's probably safe to park in that part of town for a while.
here's your tickets. I got you three.
I heard there was a lady doing most of the work.
piece of cake. Right, Mike?
Hey, Corey wanted to say thanks.
Hey, you guys.
listen, man, I just wanted to thank you guys for saving my life --both of ours.
thank you, and can you thank Fiona for us?
look, if you get anywhere near the super bowl, I want tickets, okay?
I want to be sitting on a goal post.
you got it, man.
Yeah, Fi?
Michael, I believe I found your bomber's house.
all right, I'm on my way.
bad news is, looks like no one'slived there in a while.
mail's piled up in the box, newspapers stacking up.
I think I may go in and poke around a little while I'm waiting.
Yeah. Fi, no. I don't want to disturb...
you think I've never broken into a house before?
Fiona, just take it easy and be careful.
when you booby trap someone else's place, you put the trigger in the door or just inside so the odds of tripping it are much higher.
if you rig your own place, the trigger has to be farther inside so you can safely enter.
a trip wire is a quick and dirty version, but a contact plate under the rug is completely undetectable.
put a little accelerant on the walls...
there's a reason they call it a firetrap.
it's Fi. Leave a message.
Fi, I'm at the addressyou gave me.
call me back if you get this.
you can't be here. It's too hot. Was anyone in there?
did you find anyonein there? - We don't know yet.
we haven't been able to confirm. It's too hot.
was there a woman in there? - Someone was seen going in.
I just need to know if someone was in there!
did you see a woman come out? Did anyone see anything? Was anyone in there?
she's -- she's -- - move back! Move!
move it back! Move it back!
we're clearing this whole street. Let's go.
it's Fi. Leave a message.
Fi, Fi, pick up the phone! Call me if you get this!
I need to know where you are!
it's Fi. Leave a message.
there you are.
you have got to geta landline in here.
Poole rigged his place to burst into flame.
it was no surprise, but I let my curiosity get away with me.
I waited for a burn out in one of the windows
now I need a new cellphone.
Michael, you didn't think that...
breakfast? For me?
I see Fiona's spending the night now.
good for you. Putting down roots.
so, you've had your couple of days.
what's the good news?
I ruled out everyone on the list you gave me.
I took another look at the blast.
I'm checking demolition specialists, uh, private contractors.
you could have someone look at that list and see if there's anyone worth flagging.
is this some kind of a joke?
from what I hear, you have plenty of time to run around town playing dress-up with your friends, but the bestyou can do for me is a needle in a haystack?
if you have a better idea, I'm willing to hear it.
you're my idea, Michael.
make no mistake --there are those who think you're more trouble than you're worth.
I've convinced them that you're useful cause you can find the bomber.
what do you think's gonna happen to you if you don't deliver?
same thing that would happen to you, I suppose.
you gonna run that check for me?
give me the list.
Michael... it's time you focus on helping yourself, or you're not gonna be around to help anyone else.
it's Fi. Leave a message.
I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice On you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing.
no cash, no credit, No job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
should we shoot them?
...an old friend who used To inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies.
a bunch of bitchy little girls.
...family, too...
Hey, is that your mom again?
...if you're desperate.
someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line
until You figure out who burned you,
you're not going anywhere.
someone out there wants you dead, and we both need to know who.
you're really gonna do this? Hunt them down?
the enemy of my enemy could be my friend.
I got the chemical analysis back from the explosion.
professional.
any progress finding our bomber?
Nope. Checked the blast. Crude i. E.D.
amateur hour.
we recruited you because you're a good liar.
I guess we can't complain too much when you lie to us.
your bombers couldn't go out the front door after they set it.
if they went off the balcony...
I could check the security cameras at the businesses along the river.
when you work for an intelligence agency,
you operate within an official structure.
there's a chain of command to report to,
protocols to be observed.
no one questions their mission.
but when you freelance, You don't have those luxuries.
getting your team on board may require some convincing.
I don't have a problem with hunting down someone
who planted a bomb at your place.
I have a problem with why you're hunting him.
if this was about revenge, I'd be fine with it.
revenge is a waste of time.
well, so is watching TV and eating candy.
you do it 'cause it feels good.
you are finding a killer for the people Who ruined your life.
when I find him, I'll have more on them.
intelligence gathering - Right.
he should at least suffer a little.
well, when I find him, there will be some pain involved.
are you happy?
delighted.
do you see that storage facility?
it has security cameras that cover the approach to your loft from the road.
here's the name of the service rep who installed the security system.
and the model number.
you're welcome.
you do care.
now run along before I change my mind.
spies love technology upgrades.
when someone replaces old equipment.
a computer, a cellphone, a pda.
getting information becomes as easy as looking through the trash.
I cannot believe Phil didn't call you.
I was up on an install up in Boca.
they had me come down here and do your service upgrade.
I got the paperwork right here.
is it gonna take a long time?
no, it shouldn't be too long.
it's just a simple switch-out of a unit.
well, I should check with them.
no. You should yell at them, is what you should do.
I'm gonna get started here.
when you need to steal information in a hurry,
just arrange the technology upgrade yourself.
Ron, it's kay, at Evergreen.
Yeah. There's a guy here doing an upgrade,
but I don't have him on the schedules.
hang on. I'm on with Ron Lummer. He said he needs to speak to you.
Yeah, Ron?
Yeah. Who is this?
no, no, no. You're looking in the wrong files.
it's Evergreen storage. It's on your desk by the bobble-head guy.
what are you talking about? I don't have a file.
you found it? - Found what?
yeah?
it looks like Phil dropped the ball on this one.
I'm calling the police right now.
no, no, no, no. Don't be too hard on him.
everybody makes mistakes. - You're breaking the law.
don't touch anything.
you know me, Ron. Anything for you.
just save me a donut! - This isn't funny! You hear me?!
you're going to jail! I'm...
what did he say?
well, somebody's in trouble, but it ain't me.
all right, sorry for the inconvenience.
if you need to buy a few seconds in an office environment,
programming a computer to dial every phone in an office simultaneously.
is simple and cheap.
just set up your cellphone to trigger the call remotely.
sounds like you guys are busy.
to get away clean from an office, it's okay to run.
people run out of offices all the time.
if the look on your face says "I'm in a hurry,
you can go as fast as you want.
it's all about covering ground before the yelling starts.
Hey! Hey, stop!
the one you love is closer than you think.
what are you saying?
the one who burned you is closer than you think.
what? What?
that got your attention.
not funny, Fi.
is this what your life's become, Michael?
running around like Carla's errand boy?
I'm doing this so I can get out from under Carla.
the guy who blew me up - she hates him.
so I would like to meet him.
I think I found something.
passed the camera twice in 90 minutes the day of the bombing.
right time, too.
collapsible ladder for getting down from your balcony.
city worker outfit keeps people from asking questions.
meet the man who tried to kill me.
kind of ordinary for a spy killer.
what were you expecting? - I don't know.
you know, after all this, like, boots and a mask, at least.
you know, a cape, maybe?
his gear is from city of Miami Public Works.
capes aren't standard issue.
Fi's checking it out.
Hey, good news.
something to take your mind off all this.
I got a way to score some dolphins tickets.
Sam... - Come on, Mikey.
when's the last time You did something that regular people do?
don't be afraid. I'll be right there with you.
50- yard line, third row, beer in big plastic cups.
how are we getting these tickets?
buddy of mine - Sean Martin.
he used to play for the dphins in the '90s.
he, um - He needs a little favor.
and there it is. - Yeah, well, come on.
look, we can probably wrap this up in a day.
we're supposed to meet him at 2: 00.
most of these guys I handpicked in the roughest part of overtown
pulled them out of broken families, gangs.
put them on the field. - See, Mike?
he's a great humanitarian, and he's got tickets on the 50- yard line.
Sam said you had a problem.
not me.
one of my players.
good kid - stays out of trouble,
but he got into a fight the other day.
a fight? What about?
not sure.
I just know the guy he fought is bad news
Felix Cole, a local gangster.
word is
he wants Corey dead.
gangster - This is the little problem you said.
yeah - Hey, Sean, what exactly were you hoping for here, favor-wise?
he's at my place with his sister.
I just wanted you guys to go by and talk to him and see what the options are.
well, If he's being hunted, he shouldn't be staying at your place.
won't be long before they look there.
Thanks, Sam. I appreciate it.
okay, so it's not a little problem,
but we're not exactly talking nosebleed seats either here, huh?
come on. Hmm?
whoa, Mike.
we got a visitor.
Hello, Michael.
is now a good time?
Carla. So great to see you.
you might want to give sam your keys.
we need to talk.
I'll meet you back at the loft.
you sure, Mike?
he's sure.
don't I get tied to the chair?
don't go soft on me now, Carla.
I thought we'd keep this meeting a little more casual.
we want to know how your investigation is going.
"we"? Who's "we"?
love to meet the team, if they're around!
Michael, sit down.
we got our analysis back of the explosives at your place.
same method and materials used on the other operatives that were attacked.
"Operatives." Plural.
how many exactly? Do I get names?
no.
I thought you weren't going to tie my hands.
I've seen your work.
you do just fine with your hands tied.
everything I can share with you is here.
and it stays here.
look it over, Let us know when you're done.
what if I have to go to the little boys room?
well, you're gonna have to hold it.
my men have orders to shoot you if you try to leave the room.
Hey, Mike.
well, that was a quickie.
you look...
unbruised.
just a few paper cuts.
I got a look at Carla's files.
she thinks the bomber is not local.
so the big, bad burn- notice lady's a step behind you.
you think it's gonna stay that way?
well, I asked for a list of all demolition experts.
who have spent time in Serbia and Montenegro.
said I saw a pattern there.
Yeah, we got another meeting on the books.
nice. Fi's upstairs with the kids.
I'm just heading out to get dinner for everybody.
pizza time? - Yeah.
Mike, just a heads-up.
this one has Fi a little...
fired up.
sorry. I was, uh, delayed.
Oh, that's okay, Michael. I was getting to know your guests.
Hey. I'm - I'm Corey.
this is my little sister, Tanya.
Hi. I'm Michael.
nice to meet you.
they told me about their situation.
it seems this man...
he took Tanya for a ride in his car...
...and then he attacked her.
and she escaped, barely,
and then Corey went after him with a baseball bat.
I found her crying in the street.
I just wanted to make sure he never tried to come back...
no explanation necessary.
use a golf club next time.
greater force to a smaller area.
Yeah.
but now he's after me.
his guys came to my house.
they tried to shoot me in the street.
I mean, I don't know where to go.
it's fine.
we'll take care of it.
would you excuse me?
Fiona, could I talk with you out on the balcony?
Michael, I'm gonna say this once.
we are helping these kids.
Fi, this is a job for the police.
Oh, sure. If we let Felix kill Corey,
we'll have more evidence when he comes after this girl again.
you made your point. We can get them out of town.
no. They've done nothing wrong. They're not going anywhere.
that sick son of a bitch is going somewhere,
and this is not a discussion.
Fiona, you're letting your emotions get the best of you.
no. I'm doing better than that.
I'm letting my feelings run the show,
and I feel very strongly about this!
Felix works out of that club, mostly.
his crew boosts cars for the 24k syndicate.
that's him next to the GTO.
man, what was I thinking?
he's a stone-cold gangster.
no, he doesn't deserve to be called a gangster.
anyone who attacks a 15-year-old is a pervert.
see, the thing is,
ever since the word went out, his whole gang is after me
the whole 24k crew.
the whole 24k crew.
Oh, this is getting better and better.
you see that guy he's talking to?
the guy with the glasses by the table?
that's Tony Soto, the boss.
Felix earns a lot of money for that guy.
any car that gets boosted from here to midtown,
it's his guys.
listen, seriously,
I don't think there's anything you guys can do.
Oh, don't worry, Corey.
there's a long list of things we can do.
you know, just for the record,
when I said "favor," I was thinking, like,
find somebody's lost dog or something like that.
you're gonna have to work a little harder than you're used to.
I work plenty hard, lady. I just make it look easy.
Corey's up against an organization here, Fi.
Felix is well-connected.
well, then we'll just have to disconnect him, won't we?
Tony won't back Felix if we put him out of business.
a new gang of car thieves is coming to town.
you want to take him Head-on?
well, then we got to stash corey and his sister, Tanya, somewhere for a bit.
Yep.
Corey and Tanya are getting settled, and I'm making spaghetti.
excuse me. - Ma, I'm sorry.
Fiona really felt strongly about them being in a nicer environment than the loft, and,
well, you know, she...
she was really not in the mood to discuss the point.
it's fine. If you didn't bring people over, I'd never see you.
and thank you for what you did for your brother.
for - for what? - Your brother's papers.
when he got out of jail?
the arrest was erased, like it never happened.
you didn't do that? - Not exactly.
it was, uh - it was done for me.
well, thank your friends for me, then.
Yeah, my friends put him in jail in the first place, actually, so...
sometimes I forget how complicated your life is.
there's a reason armies wear uniforms,
even though they make them easier to spot.
sometimes that's what you want.
uniforms suggest organization, power, and numbers.
these, in turn, inspire fear.
and as any good operative knows,
there's no more effective weapon than fear.
nice car.
it's too bad, really.
what's too bad?
pepper grenades are used by antiterrorist units to disable and stun.
not lethal, but a face full of pepper gas will keep you pretty busy.
no, no, no. Don't go anywhere.
the party's just starting.
what the hell, man?!
No!
melting through the engine block of a car isn't hard if you know what you're doing.
a few pounds of thermite in a coffee can and a fuse will do the trick
and put on a pretty good show.
Felix, over here.
it's time for you to leave Miami.
you what? You did that to his car?
he's gonna come after you.
better than him coming after you.
we're just sending him a message
it's time for him to move on.
Yeah, sounds like it.
damn.
I looked through those pictures Mr. Axe gave to me.
you recognize anyone?
Yeah, This dude here is j. B.
he's definitely big-time.
that's rodrick.
and this dude here?
they call reed.
these three are felix's main boosters.
I found some crackers.
mom?
these are like cardboard.
well, they were in the back of the cupboard. They're a few years old.
Corey's been helping me clean out all of the old food in the house.
he ate a can of smoked oysters That I've had since you were a baby??
a little salty, but they really hit the spot.
Thanks, Ms. Westen. - Oh, no. Thank you.
can we go home now?
not yet.
this was a good first step,
but we still have to be careful.
is there any family that you have that Felix might know about?
no. It's just me and Tanya.
our mom passed last year. We got family up north.
but I need to finish school here.
I got a chance at a scholarship.
coach Martin looks after us if we need it.
well, I think it's time to talk to coach Martin.
the whole neighborhood's talking about what happened with Felix yesterday.
the engine of his car melted into the road?
it's crazy.
Yeah, well, crazy's kind of what you want in a situation like this.
I mean, you want felix to worry about something.
that's bigger than some kid beating him up.
sounds like a plan to me.
if there's anything I can do to help...
Yeah, actually, I need you to keep your head down for a while, 'Cause this is gonna get worse before it gets better.
Sam, you're asking me to hide?
hide? Oh, no, no, no. Of course not.
I just need you to be some place where no one can see you.
until I give the all-clear.
you know, for the kids.
when you need to get into a building in a hurry,
you can always count on a fire exit.
every building has them.
it's just about knowing how to use them.
the right shape charge will put a big enough dent.
in a steel door to disengage the lock,
which can turn a fire exit into a convenient and unexpected entrance.
a coil of detcord attached to a rubber mat
will give you the explosion you need.
and allow you to point it wherever you need it to go.
s. W. A. T. Teams call it a hockey puck.
let me do that.
I have a more delicate touch.
I made some progress finding your would-be assassin today.
Yeah. There's a chance he works at A. S. A. Dismantling.
the city contracts their demolition work with them.
I think I'll pay him a visit, see what I can find out.
it's beautiful.
Yeah.
beautiful.
so, the front of the place is pretty well guarded, but that's it.
and Felix? - He hangs around the back.
he's there now.
fresh from the printer.
shall we?
I want to know who the hell they are!
they come out of nowhere,
destroy my car, tell me to leave my home,
and you say nobody...
nobody knows anything?
no, Felix. Nobody's seen nothing.
then maybe they're not looking hard enough.
"Blitzkrieg," Or "lightning war,"
was a strategy pioneered by the germans in world war II.
it refers to a fast attack designed to inspire fear and confusion,
penetrating quickly behind enemy lines.
good afternoon. Let's get those hands up.
I'll thank you to back up against the wall.
keep your hands Where I can see 'em.
nice. Comfortable?
Hello, Felix.
who the hell are you people?
the name's Johnny.
we got a lot In common, Felix.
we're both In the car-theft game.
only we work Miami, and you - well, you work someplace else.
you have 48 hours.
after that, we'll make your travel arrangements for you.
leave town?
I'm supposed to be scared of some fancy-ass suits and a shotgun?
you better get the hell out of my establishment.
I hear you. You're busy. You got a lot to do.
after all, You only have...
...47 hours, 59 minutes...
and 10 seconds...
trust me, Felix.
you want to move on.
you got a lot of headaches here you don't need.
Miami is very humid In the summer,
and you got all these people you have to manage.
plus your place Is on fire.
I'll kill you!
take care.
you hear me?!
do you hear me?!
did you see the shopping list your mother gave Sam?
Corey is eating his own body weight in cereal every day.
he's a growing boy.
I have to say, I like this Johnny.
he's got flair.
he reminds me of your cover in dublin when we first met.
do you rember what you called yourself?
sometimes I wonder if...
he's the one I felt in love with.
I wouldn't be surprised.
we caused a lot of mayhem, you and I.
he was your type of guy.
Yes, he was.
where did he go?
Oh, you know how it is with cover i. D. S.
you become who you need to be.
and everyone gets to guess who you really are.
I'll see you later, Michael.
I have an appointment at A. S. A.
dismantling and demolition.
Fi, if you see this guy,
I'll give him a kiss from you.
are you Eric?
Yeah.
Nina Roberts, Green Row publishing.
we spoke on the phone yesterday.
Oh, right. Um...
you sell the calendars. - No, darling.
I make the calendars.
theme calendars.
firefighters, lumberjacks, cops, cowboys...
and now the men of demolition.
nothing turns a woman on more than when something goes "boom."
do me a favor.
don't tell them you're doing it.
why is that?
well, No feelings get hurt if I just talk to the guys I'm interested in.
all I need is another homely firefighter offering to wax his chest in my office.
so, um...
what do you look for?
depends.
but I think I'm looking at Mr. January right here.
target selection is one of the least glamorous.
but most important elements in any strategy.
you want to take out the people your opponent depends on.
the ones his organization can't function without.
lose your keys?
I can give you a ride.
Hi.
don't look so scared.
loaded it with a bean-bag round,
so it won't do any permanent damage.
but the temporary damage - that hurts like hell.
did I forget to mention that?
my fault. My fault.
maybe we should exchange insurance information.
or maybe you should put these on...
and get into the trunk of my car.
Yeah. You see? Look.
there's an element of theater in any offensive campaign.
it's not just about bullets and bodies
killing people usually creates more problems than it solves.
it's about undermining your enemy's will to fight,
destroying the morale of his troops,
sending the message that fighting back is useless.
because the battle is already lost.
I brought you a little going-away present.
you call this a present? - Yeah. They're alive.
Yeah, but you won't be.
I'm good to go if you are.
you really want to do this in front of all these people in broad daylight?
you just wait, Johnny boy.
Oh, I'll wait.
I'll wait 23 hours and 14 minutes.
clean this up, man!
Yeah. - Hello, Johnny.
this is Tony Soto. Maybe you've heard of me?
you're Felix's boss. Yeah.
there's a car coming up the street.
I see it.
I want to talk to you.
well, go ahead and talk. That's what phones are for.
no. In person.
get in the car. - Get in the car.
I'm new to Miami, but are most people that stupid here?
I'll leave two of my guys with your people, unarmed,
to guarantee your safety.
and I'm not asking. I'm telling.
now get in.
keep these boys company. I'm going to meet Tony Soto.
there's an old saying in war that no plan survives the battlefield.
often, as a situation evolves, you create new enemies.
sometimes you create new alliances, new friends.
soldiers are fine for dealing with the enemies,
but you need a spy to handle new friends.
behold the ghost haunting Felix Cole.
where you from?
around. Why am I here?
you got style, Johnny.
you're aggressive.
boom - I like that.
nice to be appreciated.
Felix has been a good earner,
but any guy who lets someone punk him like you did,
lets a 17-year-old kick his ass with a baseball bat...
well, I can't have that kind of weakness in my house.
I couldn't agree more.
which brings me to my question
what exactly do you want?
my team doesn't like competition.
we want to be the only game in town.
we're selfish that way.
I'm selfish this way
nobody operates in this neighborhood without dealing with me.
I'll deal with you. Listen, Felix is an amateur.
he steals a few cars for sale and lays the rest off in chop shops.
go to a high school. A kid can do that.
us? We deal in high-end export - shipping them overseas at a markup.
overseas?
how do you get the cars through customs?
we clean 'em and clone 'em.
untraceable.
sell them at twice the price.
now, I can't have these idiots running around,
boosting minivans with a shim and a screwdriver.
you can talk, Johnny. I'm gonna give you that.
but let's see if you can deliver.
hot off the street.
bring it back clean. Show me how it works.
you could be my new car man.
Felix is out?
Felix is out, or you are.
so, this is your job application?
more or less.
so, meanwhile, some poor guy's running around,
looking for his $150, 000 car.
Yeah, we'll get it back to him.
we got to move fast on this one, Sam.
Yeah. No kidding.
you know, I went to Felix's place earlier to do some surveillance.
he's been going nuts since we did our thing.
well, the more panicked he is, the easier our job is.
Yeah, but you know, this isn't just business, Mike.
I mean, he put the word out to every kid in the neighborhood to look for Corey.
that was the plan. We made him look vulnerable.
with Tony breathing down his neck, he has to look strong now.
quit yapping. Let's go.
the actual theft of a car isn't difficult.
the hard part is selling it once you have it.
between the license, registration, tax records, and vin number,
it's surprisingly hard to turn a car into cash.
the best approach is to start with clean paperwork.
on another car from out of state,
then match the stolen car to the clean paperwork.
that means new vin tags and a new registration.
and in case someone decides to check closely,
some hydrochloric acid and a file
will make the etched vin number on the car chassis impossible to read.
well, that's it.
so, Mike, you think I should Drive around south beach,
you know, just to make sure it still drives okay?
knock yourself out. I've got a meeting.
okay. Say hi to Carla for me.
Hello, Michael.
Hello, Carla.
do we have to go all the way to your office,
or can we just do this here?
everybody who's ever blown something up in eastern europe.
your ex-girlfriend's on there.
I think We can rule Fiona out.
Really?
she has the expertise, and she certainly had access.
lot of names here. This could take some time.
two days.
driver.
I could get started that much faster if you just dropped me off at home.
go up, make a left, Make an...
goodbye, Michael.
man. Look at that sweater.
what?
Yeah. That was Christmas.
michael must have been 15, I think.
God, don't they look cute? So sweet.
must be nice.
me and Corey
we never had a family like that.
neither did we, sweetheart.
see the bruise on Michael's cheek?
he and his father got into a fight because Frank was...
pushing his brother around.
anyway, nobody was talking to anybody, so I said, "I'm gonna throw the whole dinner down the garbage,
unless they stood there and took that picture.
he fought his dad on
on christmas?
he was being a good big brother.
like you.
is that everyone? - Yep.
past and present.
look who's on top.
I'll schedule photo sessions in a few weeks,
once I've had time to go over all this.
cool.
remember...
I'll be waiting.
Michael, I believe I found your bomber.
who is it, Fi?
his name is Derek Poole, and he works part-time for A. S. A.
I guess we know what he does with the rest of his time.
can you get a home address?
what do you think?
what's the word?
fi got a name.
you expecting somebody, Mike?
Nope.
who's there?
Felix and his boys jumped me.
they said if I didn't set up a meeting with Corey,
they would go after my players.
he said he just wanted to talk to him.
no. He's going to kill him.
he'll probably kill you both.
should we call the police?
well, we could get Felix arrested for assaulting you,
but his crew would still be on the streets,
and Corey would still be in danger.
so, what are we going to do, guys?
cause I can't have this guy going after my players.
Felix is on the edge. It's time to push him over.
you're gonna call him. Set up the meeting.
it's all right. We've done this before.
so, this address Sean got from Felix?
it's an alley.
industrial area by midtown.
perfect spot for an ambush?
bingo.
you won yourself a beer, Mikey.
so, poked around.
looks like this guy Felix is kind of a one-trick pony when it comes to hits.
a few years ago, one of his rivals got popped.
same setup, different alley.
if something works... - Yeah.
basically, car pulls in, bad guys box him in,
hose him down with lead.
well, this I can work with.
can I, uh, work with that? Thank you.
there are a couple of ways to make a vehicle bullet-resistant.
$60, 000 worth of titanium siding will do the job.
or you can pick up a few extra copies of the yellow pages
from your local phone company.
most non-armor-piercing bullets will only penetrate a phone book
to a depth of an inch or two.
behind a layer of steel, tt's more like a quarter of an inch.
commercially available foam sealants
will keep your tires rolling long enough to get you out of danger.
for the windows-dual-layer, high-density plexiglas is your best bet.
it's expensive,
but bulletproof glass is not the sort of thing you skimp on.
my guy called the cops.
it checks out clean.
you could drive it to the police station yourself,
and you wouldn't have to worry about it.
I must say, i'm impressed.
we aim to please.
all right. Let's check out this operation of yours.
let's go.
I figured you for a nicer ride.
we don't like to take anything flashy to our location.
we can't afford to attract attention.
you're careful. That's good.
maybe a little crazy, but you're careful.
and when it counts. Now, about Felix...
don't worry about him.
this checks out,
I'll take care of Felix.
countless wars have been fought over misunderstanding
tragic mistakes, misperceptions that turn people against each other forever.
that's Corey's car. Let's do this.
of course, it's not so tragic.
when you're the one creating the misunderstanding.
it's up here. We operate out of a warehouse.
we do all our work there.
nothing's in our name, so there's no connection to us.
Johnny, is that Felix's car?
you tell felix You were meeting us?
no, I...
well, then why the hell is he here?
he's got a gun. Get down!
get us the hell out of here!
we got to ditch this thing.
you can call your guys for a ride?
Yeah, yeah. Jesus. How did we...
we armored the car. We're crazy, but we're not stupid.
you know, that son of a bitch, he...
Yeah, about that.
you have a few things to straighten out before we get into business together.
Yeah, I'd say so.
I think we're gonna leave Miami for a little while.
let it cool down.
give you time to clean house.
you straighten out this thing with Felix.
Oh, I'll straighten it out.
there's our ride.
we'll give you a call when it's time.
I want you to get big Ed on the phone.
I'm gonna take care of this cat.
Felix cleared out of Miami soon as he heard Tony was looking for him.
his whole crew left, too.
Yeah, it's probably safe to park in that part of town for a while.
here's your tickets. I got you three.
I heard there was a lady doing most of the work.
piece of cake. Right, Mike?
Hey, Corey wanted to say thanks.
Hey, you guys.
listen, man, I just wanted to thank you guys for saving my life.
both of ours.
thank you, and can you thank Fiona for us?
look, if you get anywhere near the super bowl,
I want tickets, okay?
I want to be sitting on a goalpost.
you got it, man.
Yeah, Fi?
Michael, I believe I found your bomber's house.
all right, I'm on my way.
bad news is, looks like no one's lived there in a while.
mail's piled up in the box, newspapers stacking up.
I think I may go in and poke around a little while I'm waiting.
Yeah. Fi, no. I don't want to disturb...
you think I've never broken into a house before?
Fiona, just take it easy and be careful.
when you booby trap someone else's place,
you put the trigger in the door or just inside.
so the odds of tripping it are much higher.
if you rig your own place,
the trigger has to be farther inside so you can safely enter.
a trip wire is a quick and dirty version,
but a contact plate under the rug is completely undetectable.
put a little accelerant on the walls...
there's a reason they call it a firetrap.
it's Fi. Leave a message.
Fi, I'm at the address you gave me.
call me back if you get this.
Hey, hey, hey. You can't be here.
was anyone in there?
it's too hot. - Did you find anyone in there?
we don't know yet.
we haven't been able to confirm.
it's too hot. - Was there a woman in there?!
someone was seen going in.
I just need to know - If someone was in there!
did you see a woman come out?!
did anyone see anything?!
was anyone in there?!
she's - She's - - Move back! Move!
move it back!
move it back!
we're clearing this whole street. Let's go.
it's Fi. Leave a message.
Fi, Fi, Pick up the phone!
call me if you get this!
I need to know where you are!
it's Fi. Leave a message.
there you are.
you have got to get a landline in here.
Poole rigged his place to burst into flame.
it was no surprise, but I let my curiosity get away with me.
I waited for a burnout in one of the windows...
now I need A new cellphone.
Michael, You didn't think that...?
breakfast?
for me?
I see Fiona's spending the night now.
good for you.
putting down roots.
so, you've had your couple of days.
what's the good news?
I ruled out everyone on the list you gave me.
I took another look at the blast.
I'm checking demolition specialists, Uh, private contractors.
you could have someone look at that list
and see if there's anyone worth flagging.
is this some kind of a joke?
from what I hear, you have plenty of time
to run around town playing dress-up with your friends,
but the best you can do for me is a needle in a haystack?
if you have a better idea, I'm willing to hear it.
you're my idea, Michael.
make no mistake
there are those who think you're more trouble than you're worth.
I've convinced them that you're useful 'cause you can find the bomber.
what do you think's gonna happen to you if you don't deliver?
same thing that would happen to you, I suppose.
you gonna run that check for me?
give me the list.
it's time you focus on helping yourself,
or you're not gonna be around to help anyone else.
it's Fi. Leave a message.
my name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing
no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
should we shoot them?
an old friend who used to inform on you to the fbi...
you know spies --a bunch of bitchy little girls.
family, too...
Hey, is that your mom again?
if you're desperate.
someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line -- until you figure out who burned you, you're not going anywhere.
someone out there wants you dead, and we both need to know who.
you're really gonna do this? Hunt them down?
the enemy of my enemy could be my friend.
I got the chemical analysis backfrom the explosion. Professional.
any progress finding our bomber?
Nope. Checked the blast. Crude I. E.D. Amateur hour.
we recruited you because you're a good liar.
I guess we can't complain too much when you lie to us.
your bombers couldn't go out the front door after they set it.
if they went off the balcony...
I could check the security cameras at the businesses along the river.
when you work for an intelligence agency, you operate within an official structure.
there's a chain of command to report to, protocols to be observed.
no one questions their mission.
but when you freelance, you don't have those luxuries.
getting your team on board may require some convincing.
I don't have a problem with hunting down someone who planted a bombat your place.
I have a problem with why you're hunting him.
if this was about revenge, I'd be fine with it.
revenge is a waste of time.
well, so is watching tvand eating candy.
you do it'cause it feels good.
you are finding a killer for the people who ruined your life.
when I find him, I'll have more on them.
Ah, intelligence gathering -- right.
he should at least suffer a little.
well, when I find him, there will be some pain involved. Are you happy?
delighted.
do you see that storage facility?
it has security cameras that cover the approach to your loft from the road.
here's the name of the service rep who installed the security system.
and the model number. You're welcome.
you do care.
now run along before I change my mind.
spies love technology upgrades.
when someone replaces old equipment -- a computer, a cellphone, a pda
getting information becomes as easy as looking through the trash.
I can not believe Phil didn't call you.
I was up on an install up in Boca.
they had me come down here and do your service upgrade. I got the paper work right here.
is it gonna takea long time?
no, it shouldn't betoo long. It's just a simple switch-out of a unit.
well, I should check with them.
no. You should yell at them, is what you should do. I'm gonna get started here.
when you need to steal information in a hurry, just arrange the technology upgrade yourself.
Ron, it's Kay, at Evergreen.
Yeah. There's a guy here doing an upgrade, but I don't have him on the schedules.
hang on. I'm on with Ron Lummer. He said he needs to speak to you.
Yeah, Ron? - Yeah. Who is this?
no, no, no. You're looking in the wrong files. It's Evergreen storage.
it's on your desk by the bobble-head guy. - What are you talking about? I don't have a file.
you found it?
Oh, it looks like Phil dropped the ball on this one.
I'm calling the policeright now.
no, no, no, no. Don't be too hard on him. Everybody makes mistakes.
you're breaking the law. Don't touch anything.
you know me, Ron. Anything for you. Just save me a donut! - This isn't funny! You hear me?
you're going to jail! I'm
what did he say?
well, somebody's in trouble, but it ain't me.
all right, sorry for the inconvenience.
if you need to buy a few seconds in an office environment, programming a computer to dial every phone in an office simultaneously is simple and cheap.
just set up your cellphone to trigger the call remotely.
sounds like you guys are busy.
to get away clean from an office, it's okay to run.
people run out of offices all the time.
if the look on your face says "I'm in a hurry," you can go as fast as you want.
it's all about covering ground before the yelling starts.
Hey, stop!
the one you love is closer than you think.
what's yours say?
the one who burned you is closer than you think.
what? What?
Oh, that got your attention.
not funny, Fi.
is this what your life's become, Michael?
running around like Carla's errand boy?
I'm doing this so I can get out from under Carla.
the guy who blew me up --she hates him.
so I would like to meet him.
I think I found something.
passed the camera twice in 90 minutes the day of the bombing.
right time, too.
collapsible ladder for getting down from your balcony.
city worker outfit keeps people from asking questions.
meet the man who tried to kill me.
kind of ordinary for a spy killer.
what were you expecting?
I don't know. You know, after all this, like, boots and a mask, at least.
you know, a cape, maybe?
his gear is from city of miami public works.
capes aren't standard issue.
Fi's checking it out.
Hey, good news -- something to take your mind off all this.
I got a way to score some dolphins tickets.
Sam... - come on, Mikey.
when's the last time you did something that regular people do?
don't be afraid. I'll be right there with you.
50-yard line, third row, beer in big plastic cups.
how are we getting these tickets?
buddy of mine -- Sean Martin.
he used to play for the 'phins in the '90s.
he, um -- he needs a little favor.
and there it is. - Yeah, well, come on.
look, we can probably wrap this up in a day.
we're supposed to meet him at 2: 00.
most of these guys I hand picked in the roughest part of overtown
pulled them out of broken families, gangs. Put them on the field.
see, Mike? He's a great humanitarian, and he's got tickets on the 50-yard line.
Sam said you had a problem.
not me. One of my players -- Corey Jensen.
good kid -- stays out of trouble, but he got into a fight the other day.
a fight? What about?
not sure. I just know the guy he fought is bad news
Felix Cole, a local gangster.
word is -- he wants Corey dead.
gangster -- this is the little problem you
yeah -- hey, Sean, what exactly were you hoping for here, favor-wise?
he's at my place with his sister.
I just wanted you guys to go by and talk to him and see what the options are.
well, if he's being hunted, he shouldn't be staying at your place.
won't be long before they look there.
Mike's right. Look, let me swing by. I'll pick them up.
Thanks, Sam. I appreciate it.
okay, so it's not a little problem, but we're not exactly talking nosebleed seats either here, huh? Come on.
whoa, Mike. We got a visitor.
Hello, Michael. Is now a good time?
Carla. So great to see you.
you might want to give Sam your keys. We need to talk.
I'll meet you back at the loft. - You sure, Mike?
he's sure.
don't I get tied to the chair? Don't go soft on me now, Carla.
I thought we'd keep this meeting a little more casual.
we want to know how your investigation is going.
we"? Who's "we"? Love to meet the team, if they're around!
Michael, sit down.
we got our analysis back of the explosives at your place.
same method and materials used on the other operatives that were attacked.
Operatives." Plural. How many exactly? Do I get names?
no.
I thought you weren't going to tie my hands.
I've seen your work.
you do just fine with your hands tied.
everything I can share with you is here.
and it stays here. Look it over, let us know when you're done.
what if I have to go to the little boys room?
well, you're gonna have to hold it.
my men have orders to shoot you if you try to leave the room.
Hey, Mike.
well, that was a quickie.
you look... unbruised.
just a few paper cuts.
I got a look at Carla's files.
she thinks the bomberis not local.
Oh, so the big, bad burn-notice lady's a step behind you.
you think it's gonna stay that way?
well, I asked for a list of all demolition experts who have spent time in Serbia and Montenegro.
said I saw a pattern there.
Yeah, we got another meeting on the books.
nice. Fi's upstairs with the kids.
I'm just heading out to get dinner for everybody.
pizza time? - Yeah.
uh, Mike, just a heads-up.
this one has Fi a little... fired up.
sorry. I was, uh, delayed.
Oh, that's Okay, Michael. I was getting to know your guests.
I'm -- I'm Corey. This is my little sister, Tanya.
I'm Michael. - Nice to meet you.
they told me about their situation.
it seems this man --Felix?
he took Tanya for a ride in his car...
and then he attacked her.
and she escaped, barely, and then Corey went after him with a baseball bat.
I found her crying in the street.
I just wanted to make sure he never tried to come back
no explanation necessary.
use a golf club next time.
greater force to a smaller area.
um, yeah. But now he's after me.
his guys came to my house. They tried to shoot me in the street.
I mean, I don't know where to go.
it's fine. We'll take care of it.
would you excuse me?
Fiona, could I talk with you out on the balcony?
Michael, I'm gonna say this once.
we are helping these kids.
Fi, this is a job for the police.
Oh, sure. If we let Felix kill Corey, we'll have more evidence when he comes after this girl again.
you made your point. We can get them out of town.
no. They've done nothing wrong. They're not going anywhere.
that sick son of a bitch is going somewhere, and this is not a discussion.
Fiona, you're letting your emotions get the best of you.
no. I'm doing better than that.
I'm letting my feelings run the show, and I feel very strongly about this!
Felix works out of that club, mostly.
his crew boosts cars for the 24k syndicate.
that's him next to the gto.
man, what was I thinking?
he's a stone-cold gangster.
no, he doesn't deserve to be called a gangster.
anyone who attacks a 15-year-old is a pervert.
see, the thing is, ever since the word went out, his whole gang is after me --the whole 24k crew.
the whole 24k crew.
Oh, this is getting betterand better.
you see that guy he's talking to?
the guy with the glasses by the table?
that's Tony Soto, the boss.
Felix earns a lot of money for that guy.
any car that gets boosted from here to midtown, it's his guys.
listen, seriously, I don't think there's anything you guys can do.
Oh, don't worry, Corey.
there's a long list of things we can do.
you know, just for the record, when I said "favor,
I was thinking, like, find somebody's lost dog or something like that.
you're gonna have to worka little harder than you're used to.
I work plenty hard, lady. I just make it look easy.
Corey's up against an organization here, fi.
Felix is well-connected.
well, then we'll just have to disconnect him, won't we?
Tony won't back Felix if we put him out of business.
a new gang of car thieves is coming to town.
you want to take himhead-on?
well, then we got to stash Coreyand his sister, Tanya, somewhere for a bit.
Yep.
Corey and Tanyaare getting settled, and I'm making spaghetti. Excuse me.
ma, I'm sorry.
Fiona really felt strongly about them being in a nice renvironment than the loft, and, uh...
well, you know, she -- she was really not in the mood to discuss the point.
it's fine. If you didn't bring people over, I'd never see you.
Oh, and thank you for what you did for your brother.
for -- for what?
your brother's papers. When he got out of jail?
the arrest was erased, like it never happened. You didn't do that?
not exactly. It was, uh --it was done for me.
well, thank your friendsfor me, then.
Yeah, my friend sput him in jail in the first place, actually, so...
sometimes I forget how complicated your life is.
there's a reason armies wear uniforms, even though they make them easier to spot.
sometimes that's what you want.
uniforms suggest organization, power, and numbers.
these, in turn, inspire fear.
and as any good operative knows, there's no more effective weapon than fear.
nice car.
it's too bad, really.
what's too bad?
pepper grenades are used by antiterrorist units to disable and stun.
not lethal, but a face full of pepper gas will keep you pretty busy.
no, no, no. Don't go anywhere. The party's just starting.
what the hell, man?
No!
melting through the engine block of a car isn't hard if you know what you're doing.
a few pounds of thermite in a coffee can and a fuse will do the trick and put on a pretty good show.
Felix. Felix. Felix, over here.
it's time for youto leave miami.
you what? You did that to his car?
he's gonna come after you.
better than him coming after you.
we're just sending him a message -- it's time for him to move on.
Yeah, sounds like it. Damn.
Oh, I looked through thosepictures mr. Axe gave to me.
you recognize anyone?
Yeah, this dude here is J. B.
he's definitely big-time.
that's rodrick.
and this dude here? They call reed.
these three are Felix's main boosters.
I found some crackers.
mom?
these are like cardboard.
well, they were in the backof the cupboard. They're a few years old.
Corey's been helping me clean out all of the old food in the house.
he ate a can of smoked oysters that I've had since you were a baby.
a little salty, but they really hit the spot. Thanks, Ms. Westen.
Oh, no. Thank you.
can we go home now?
not yet. This was a good first step, but we still have to be careful.
is there any family that you have that Felix might know about?
no. It's just me and Tanya.
our mom passed last year.
we got family up north.
but I need to finish school here.
I got a chance at a scholarship.
coach martin looks after us if we need it.
well, I think it's time to talk to coach martin.
the whole neighborhood's talking about what happened with Felix yesterday.
the engine of his car melted into the road? It's crazy.
Yeah, well, crazy'skind of what you want in a situation like this.
I mean, you want Felix to worry about something that's bigger than some kid beating him up.
sounds like a plan to me.
if there's anything I can do to help
Yeah, actually, I need you to keep your head down for a while, 'cause this is gonna get worse before it gets better.
Sam, you're asking me to hide?
hide? Oh, no, no, no. Of course not.
I just need you to be someplace where no one can see you.
until I give the all-clear.
you know, for the kids.
when you need to get into a building in a hurry, you can always count on a fire exit.
every building has them.
it's just about knowing how to use them.
the right shape charge will put a big enough dent in a steel door to disengage the lock, which can turn a fire exit into a convenient and unexpected entrance.
a coil of detcord attached to a rubber mat will give you the explosion you need and allow you to point it wherever you need it to go.
S.W.A.T.Teams call it a hockey puck.
let me do that.
I have a more delicate touch.
I made some progress finding your would-be assassin today.
Yeah. There's a chance he works at A.S.A.D is mantling.
the city contracts their demolition work with them.
I think I'll pay him a visit, see what I can find out.
it's beautiful. - Yeah.
beautiful.
so, the front of the place is pretty well guarded, but that's it.
and Felix?
he hangs around the back. He's there now.
fresh from the printer. - Shall we?
I want to know who the hell they are!
they come out of nowhere, destroy my car, tell me to leave my home, and you say nobody --nobody knows anything?
no, Felix. Nobody's seen nothing.
then maybe they're not looking hard enough.
Blitzkrieg," or "lightning war," was a strategy pioneered by the germans in world war ii.
it refers to a fast attack designed to inspire fear and confusion, penetrating quickly behind enemy lines.
good afternoon. Let's get those hands up.
I'll thank you to back up against the wall. Keep your hands where I can see 'em.
nice. Comfortable?
Hello, Felix.
who the hell are you people?
the name's Johnny.
we got a lot in common, Felix.
we're both in the car-theft game.
only we work miami, and you -- well, you work someplace else.
you have 48 hours. After that, we'll make your travel arrangements for you.
leave town?
I'm supposed to be scared of some fancy-ass suits and a shotgun?
you better get the hell out of my establishment.
I hear you. You're busy. You got a lot to do.
after all, you only have...
47 hours, 59 minutes... and 10 seconds...
left. Trust me, Felix. You want to move on.
you got a lot of headaches here you don't need.
Miami is very humid in the summer, and you got all these people you have to manage.
plus your place is on fire.
I'll kill you!
take care.
you hear me? Do you hear me?
did you see the shopping list your mother gave Sam?
Corey is eating his own body weight in cereal every day.
he's a growing boy.
I have to say, I like this Johnny. He's got flair.
he reminds me of your cover in Dublin when we first met.
do you remember what you called yourself?
sometimes I wonder if...
he's the oneI fell in love with.
I wouldn't be surprised.
we caused a lot of mayhem, you and I.
he was your type of guy.
Yes, he was. Where did he go?
Oh, you know how it is with cover I. D.S.
you become who you need to be.
and everyone gets to guesswho you really are.
I'll see you later, Michael.
I have an appointment at A.S.A. Dismantling and demolition.
Fi, if you see this guy
I'll give him a kiss from you.
are you eric? - Yeah.
Nina roberts, Green row publishing. We spoke on the phone yesterday.
Oh, right. you sell the calendars.
no, darling. I make the calendars.
theme calendars. Firefighters, lumberjacks, cops, cowboys...
and now the men of demolition.
nothing turns a woman on more than when something goes "boom.
all I need from you are names and photos of all your...demolition guys --do me a favor.
don't tell them you're doing it.
why is that?
well, no feelings get hurt if I just talk to the guys I'm interested in.
all I need is another homely fire fighter offering to wax his chest in my office.
so, um... what do you look for?
depends.
but I think I'm looking at Mr. January right here.
target selection is one of the least glamorous but most important elements in any strategy.
you want to take out the people your opponent depends on
the ones his organization can't function without.
lose your keys?
I can give you a ride.
don't look so scared.
loaded itwith a bean-bag round, so it won't doany permanent damage.
but the temporary damage --that hurts like hell.
did I forget to mention that?
my fault. My fault.
maybe we should exchange insurance information.
or maybe you should put these on...
and get into the trunk of my car.
Yeah. You see? Look.
there's an element of theater in any offensive campaign.
it's not just about bullets and bodies
killing people usually creates more problems than it solves.
it's about undermining your enemy's will to fight, destroying the morale of his troops, sending the message that fighting back is useless because the battle is already lost.
I brought you a little going-away present.
you call this a present? - Yeah. They're alive.
Yeah, but you won't be.
I'm good to go if you are.
you really want to do this in front of all these people in broad day light?
you just wait, Johnny boy.
Oh, I'll wait.
I'll wait 23 hoursand 14 minutes.
clean this up, man!
Yeah. - Hello, Johnny.
this is Tony Soto. Maybe you've heard of me?
you're Felix's boss. Yeah.
there's a car coming up the street.
I see it.
I want to talk to you.
well, go ahead and talk. That's what phones are for.
no. In person. Get in the car.
get in the car.
I'm new to miami, but are most people that stupid here?
I'll leave two of my guys with your people, unarmed, to guarantee your safety.
and I'm not asking. I'm telling.
now get in.
keep these boys company.
I'm going to meet Tony Soto.
there's an old saying in war that no plan survives the battle field.
often, as a situation evolves, you create new enemies.
sometimes you create new alliances, new friends.
soldiers are fine for dealing with the enemies, but you need a spy to handle new friends.
behold the ghost haunting Felix Cole.
where you from?
around. Why am I here?
you got style, Johnny.
you're aggressive.
boom -- I like that.
nice to be appreciated.
Felix has beena good earner, but any guy who lets someone punk him like you did, lets a 17-year-old kick his ass with a baseball bat...
well, I can't have that kind of weakness in my house.
I couldn't agree more.
which brings me to my question -- what exactly do you want?
my team doesn't like competition.
we want to be the only game in town.
we're selfish that way.
I'm selfish this way -- nobody operates in this neighborhood without dealing with me.
I'll deal with you. Listen, Felix is an amateur.
he steals a few cars for sale and lays the rest off in chop shops.
go to a high school. A kid can do that. Us?
we dealin high-end export -- shipping them overseas at a markup.
overseas? How do you get the cars through customs?
we clean 'em and clone 'em. Untraceable.
sell them at twice the price.
now, I can't have these idiots running around, boosting minivans with a shimand a screwdriver.
you can talk, Johnny. I'm gonna give you that.
but let's see if you can deliver.
hot off the street. Bring it back clean. Show me how it works.
you could be my new car man.
Felix is out?
Felix is out, or you are.
so, this is your job application?
more or less.
so, meanwhile, some poor guy's running around, looking for his $150, 000 car.
Yeah, we'll get it back to him. We got to move fast on this one, Sam.
Yeah. No kidding. You know, I went to Felix's place earlier to do some surveillance.
he's been going nuts since we did our thing.
well, the more panicked he is, the easier our job is.
Yeah, but you know, this isn't just business, Mike.
I mean, he put the word out to every kid in the neighborhood to look for Corey.
that was the plan. We made him look vulnerable.
with Tony breathing down his neck, he has to look strong now.
quit yapping. Let's go.
the actual theft of a car isn't difficult.
the hard part is selling it once you have it.
between the license, registration, tax records, and vin number,
the best approach is to start with clean paperwork on another car from out of state, then match the stolen car to the clean paperwork.
that means new vin tags and a new registration.
and in case someone decides to check close, some hydrochloric acid and a file will make the etched vin number on the car chassis impossible to read.
well, that's it.
so, Mike, you think I should drive around south beach, you know, just to make sureit still drives Okay?
knock yourself out. I've got a meeting.
okay. Say hi to Carla for me.
Hello, Michael.
Hello, Carla.
do we have to go all the way to your office, or can we just do this here?
everybody who's ever blown something up in eastern Europe.
your ex-girlfriend's on there.
I think we can rule Fiona out.
Really? She has the expertise, and she certainly had access.
lot of names here. This could take some time.
two days. Driver.
I could get started that much faster if you just dropped me off at home.
go up, make a left, make an-- - goodbye, Michael.
Aw, man. Look at that sweater.
what?
Yeah. That was christmas.
Oh, Michael must have been 15, I think.
God, don't they look cute? So sweet.
must be nice.
me and Corey -- we never had a family like that.
neither did we, sweetheart.
see the bruise on Michael's cheek?
he and his father got into a fight because Frank was...
pushing his brotheraround.
anyway, nobody was talking to anybody, so I said, "I'm gonna throw the whole dinner down the garbage,
unless they stood there and took that picture."
he fought his dad on --on christmas?
he was being a good big brother.
like you.
is that everyone? - Yep.
past and present.
Oh, look who's on top.
I'll schedule photo sessions in a few weeks, once I've had time to go over all this.
cool.
remember...
I'll be waiting.
Michael, I believe I found your bomber.
who is it, Fi?
his name is Derek Poole, and he works part-time for A.S.A.
I guess we know what he does with the rest of his time.
can you get a home address?
what do you think?
what's the word?
fi got a name.
you expecting somebody, Mike? - Nope.
who's there?
what happened?
Felix and his boys jumped me.
they said if I didn't set up a meeting with Corey, they would go after my players.
he said he just wanted to talk to him.
no. He's going to kill him. He'll probably kill you both.
should we call the police?
well, we could get Felix arrested for assaulting you, but his crew would still be on the streets, and Corey would still be in danger.
so, what are we going to do, guys? 'Cause I can't have this guy going after my players.
Felix is on the edge. It's time to push him over.
you're gonna call him. Set up the meeting.
it's all right. We've done this before.
so, this address Sean got from Felix? It's an alley.
industrial areaby midtown.
perfect spot for an ambush? - Bingo.
you won yourself a beer, Mikey.
so, poked around.
looks like this guy Felix is kind of a one-trick pony when it comes to hits.
a few years ago, one of his rivals got popped.
same setup, different alley.
if something works... - yeah.
basically, car pulls in, bad guys box him in, hose him down with lead.
well, this I can work with.
can I, uh, work with that? Thank you.
there are a couple of ways to make a vehicle bullet-resistant.
$60, 000 worth of titanium siding will do the job.
or you can pick up a few extra copies of the yellow pages from your local phone company.
most non-armor-piercing bullets will only penetrate a phone book to a depth of an inch or two.
behind a layer of steel, it's more like a quarter of an inch.
commercially available foam sealants will keep your tires rolling long enough to get you out of danger.
for the windows -- dual-layer, high-density plexiglas is your best bet.
it's expensive, but bullet-proof glass is not the sort of thing you skimp on.
my guy called the cops. It checks out clean.
you could drive it to the police station yourself, and you wouldn't have to worry about it.
I must say, I'm impressed. - We aim to please.
all right. Let's check out this operation of yours.
let's.
I figured you for a nicer ride.
we don't like to take anything flashy to our location.
we can't afford to attract attention.
you're careful. That's good.
maybe a little crazy, but you're careful.
and when it counts. Now, about Felix...
don't worry about him.
this checks out, I'll take care of Felix.
countless wars have been fought over misunderstanding
tragic mistakes, misperceptions that turn people against each other forever.
that's Corey's car. Let's do this.
of course, it's not so tragic when you're the one creating the misunderstanding.
it's up here. We operate out of a warehouse. We do all our work there.
nothing's in our name, so there's no connection to us.
Johnny, is that Felix's car?
you tell Felix you were meeting us?
no, I
well, then why the hell is he here? He's got a gun.
get down!
get us the hell out of here!
we got to ditch this thing.
you can call your guys for a ride?
Yeah, yeah. Jesus. How did we
we armored the car. We're crazy, but we're not stupid.
you know, that son of a bitch, he -- - yeah, about that.
you have a few things to straighten out before we get into business together.
Yeah, I'd say so.
I think we're gonna leave Miami for a little while. Let it cool down.
give you time to clean house.
you straighten out this thing with Felix.
Oh, I'll straighten it out.
there's our ride. We'll give you a call when it's time.
I want you to get big Edon the phone.
I'm gonna take care of this cat.
Felix cleared out of Miami soon as he heard Tony was looking for him.
his whole crew left, too.
Yeah, it's probably safe to park in that part of town for a while.
here's your tickets. I got you three.
I heard there was a lady doing most of the work.
piece of cake. Right, Mike?
Hey, Corey wanted to say thanks.
Hey, you guys.
listen, man, I just wanted to thank you guys for saving my life --both of ours.
thank you, and can you thank Fiona for us?
look, if you get anywhere near the Super Bowl, I want tickets, Okay?
I want to be sitting on a goal post.
you got it, man.
Yeah, Fi?
Michael, I believe I found your bomber's house.
all right, I'm on my way.
bad news is, looks like no one's lived there in a while.
mail's piled up in the box, newspapers stacking up.
I think I may go in and poke around a little while I'm waiting.
Yeah. Fi, no. I don't want to disturb
you think I've never broken into a house before?
Fiona, just take it easy and be careful.
when you booby trap someone else's place, you put the trigger in the door or just inside so the odds of tripping it are much higher.
if you rig your own place, the trigger has to be farther inside so you can safely enter.
a trip wire is a quick and dirty version, but a contact plate under the rug is completely undetectable.
put a little accelerant on the walls...
there's a reason they call it a firetrap.
it's Fi. Leave a message.
Fi, I'm at the address you gave me.
call me back if you get this.
you can't be here. It's too hot. Was anyone in there?
did you find anyonein there? - We don't know yet.
we haven't been able to confirm. It's too hot.
was there a womanin there? - Someone was seen going in.
I just need to know if someone was in there!
did you see a woman come out? Did anyone see anything? Was anyone in there?
she's -- she's -- - move back! Move!
move it back! Move it back!
we're clearing this whole street. Let's go.
it's Fi. Leave a message.
Fi, Fi, pick up the phone! Call me if you get this!
I need to know where you are!
it's Fi. Leave a message.
there you are.
you have got to get a land line in here.
Poole rigged his place to burst into flame.
it was no surprise, but I let my curiosity get away with me.
I waited for a burn out in one of the windows
now I need a new cellphone.
Michael, you didn't think that...
breakfast? For me?
I see Fiona's spending the night now.
good for you. Putting down roots.
so, you've hadyour couple of days.
what's the good news?
I ruled out everyone on the list you gave me.
I took another look at the blast.
I'm checking demolition specialists, uh, private contractors.
you could have someone look at that list and see if there's anyone worth flagging.
is this some kind of a joke?
from what I hear, you have plenty of time to run around town playing dress-up with your friends, but the best you can do for me is a needle in a haystack?
if you have a better idea, I'm willing to hear it.
you're my idea, Michael.
make no mistake --there are those who think you're more trouble than you're worth.
I've convinced them that you're useful 'cause you can find the bomber.
what do you think's gonna happen to you if you don't deliver?
same thing that would happen to you, I suppose.
you gonna run that check for me?
give me the list.
Michael... it's time you focus on helping yourself, or you're not gonna be around to help anyone else.
it's Fi. Leave a message.
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing -- No cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
should we shoot them?
an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI..
you know spies --a bunch of bitchy little girls.
family, too...
Hey, is that your mom again?
if you're desperate.
someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line -- until you figure out who burned you, you're not going anywhere.
getting information is all about fitting in.
if you're hunting for intel in the middle east, that means a beard and a jellaba.
if you're doing it on south beach, you're probably wearing a swimsuit and flip-flops.
you think the sarongis too much?
suddenly I'm feeling overdressed.
you look fine,Fi.Besides, we're here on business.
what is the big dealwith this bomber?
if we looked for everyone who tried to kill you, we'd do nothing else.
I need to find outwhat this guy knows.
well, if there's anyone in Miami who can track down a bomber, it's our old friends Eymour here.
hope he's not still mad about the face full of gunpowder last time we dropped by.
well, he was pretty enchanted with you once upon a time.
pretty enchanted with me?
Yeah, he showed it when he attacked me with a baseball bat.
will you do my shoulders?
you know,Fi, if, uh
if you want to talk about what happened the other night...
Oh, there's nothing to talk about. We were just blowing off some steam, right?
we should go in.
when it comes to intelligence gathering, you can't hold grudges.
the guy who hit you with a baseball bat yesterday could be an information source today.
Fi, you want to take care of...
Yeah, I'll take care of Mr. Security while you say hello to Seymour.
Hello, Seymour.
security!
nice going, jackass.
you know, I learned a thing or two after the last time you kicked his ass.
what's that?
when it comes to my personal security, I have to take care of things myself.
you have hollow-pointsin there.
Oh, you can telljust by looking?
no, I can't, but I can distract you long enough to take it.
now, I just need help tracking someone down, Seymour. That's it.
you are such a badass. It's kind of awesome. You need my help?
okay. One condition.
you got to teach me some of these moves.
sure.
all right, what's everybody staring at? This is a party!
I'm sorry, Mike.
what are we doing again?
I need help tracking someone, an explosives expert，Derek Poole.
Oh, right. A man hunt. I love it.
okay, first, you're gonna have to front me some cash to spread around. It opens doors.
no? Okay. I'll front you.
because I know you're good for it.
but we are gonna have to be in constant dialogue, Mike. Okay?
you and me, badasses in this together.
all right, jackass.
you see how they just laid you out again?
that is called teamwork, people.
and it is a beautiful thing.
so, up and at 'em. Hit the blender. Make some smoothies.
feel like mango? Mango!
Fi. Fi, I need a favor.
uh, I need to put some money together.
Seymour said he'd front you.
Yeah, Seymour's not the type of guy I want to owe money to long-term.
you want to borrow money.
if you need cash, you can get a job like the rest of us.
I can't fill out a w-2.
if the people who burned me find out I'm looking for a job, they'll wonder why I need money.
I just passed on a gig.
some art dealer, someone stealing paper clips or something dull.
pays good. You take a job under a cover I. D. No one needs to know.
you're the best.
I expect a commission, Michael.
Mike, do you have to work with Seymour?
I mean, the guy's unstable.
he's connected, and he doesn't mix well with government types.
do you have my new cover I. D?
Yes. You're miles parker. Background in corporate espionage.
you're a desk jockey. Perfect for a cushy office gig.
looks good, Sam.
Yeah, Fi, looks like I'm good to go for that art-dealer job.
Thanks, I'll call you later. Maybe we can grab dinner.
so, you two are just... grabbing dinner.
just to debrief.
right. Debrief.
there are a lot of advantages to taking on a new identity when you take a new job.
you just have to get used to the idea of lying to everyone you meet.
I'm Miles Parker.
Hi, Miles Parker.
I'm here to see Scott Chandler.
Mr. Parker!
you came highly recommended. Scott chandler. Welcome to the gallery.
thank you. Thank you very much.
can I get you something to drink?
coffee, water, scotch and soda?
I'm fine.
right this way.
wall Street, Silicon Valley, D. C.
any place where a little information goes a long way.I've been there to protect it.
any P. I.experience?
a P. I. License comes with a lot of privacy concerns.
there's a chance anything a private investigator finds could wind up in court.
Yeah, well, I prefer to resolve this quickly and quietly as possible.
quick and quiet -- that's what I do. Tell me about your problem.
a few weeks ago, I noticed unusual activity on the computers
files moved, log-ins at odd times.
and then I started hearing a buzzing sound in my office phone.
I checked it out.
infinity transmitter in its base.
I saw a lot of that in the dot-coms.
whoever installed it didn't isolate the circuit.
you were hearing a little feedback.
I want to know who planted this.
any idea what they're looking for?
I sell about $30 million worth of art a year.
they could be thieves, buyers looking to lowball a bid, other art dealers --too many possibilities.
my business, my reputation, depends on information remaining private.
let's take a look around.
now, the gallery's under 24-hour video surveillance.
you can't get through here without someone seeing you.
what about the executive offices?
well, there's no cameras, but all the offices are keypad-access only.
no one gets in here without me knowing.
well, somebody has.
does anybody have a habitof working late?
no later than I do. I'm the first one in, last one out.
so, what do you think, Mr. Parker?
think you can find whoever's doing this?
I'll see what I can do. I need a floor plan of the office.
I'll have something by the end of today. Excuse me.
alpha, it's bravo, over. - Hello, Seymour.
chalk one up for the brotherhood of badass, buddy.
I got good news. You got to get over here.
so, I asked around about that explosives guy you were looking for.
he does demo for the city, but he moonlights for the Russian mob.
this is their hangout.
he's their go-to guy when something's got to go boom.
any idea where he's hiding?
no.
seymour, you said you had good news.
Yes, I do. He's got a girlfriend. And they're hot and heavy.
I mean, they can't be apartfor more than a couple of days without some together time
you know what I'm saying? - I know what you're saying.
I bet you do. You and Fi? My god, a molten-hot action couple.
I can't even imagine what itmust be like in the bedroom.
just Don't do that. - Right? Am I right?
we're not together.
are you serious? Oh, my god. You guys were like the
bomber's girlfriend. Stay focused.
there she is.
don't point.
Bianca. She works here. Her shift startsin like 10 minutes.
nice work, Seymour.
Oh, the best part is --my jackass bodyguard
he's gonna put a tracker under her car so you can follow herright to him.
he's gonna put a tracking device under her car in front of the Russian mob?
Oh, but it's cool. I told him, just pretendlike he's tying his shoe
he's gonna tip her off that someone's watching.
keep your eyes on Bianca, and no more moves on your own!
to protect someone without blowing your cover, you have to come up with a story, one that explains what they're doing, explains what you're doing, and gets everyone out in one piece.
Hey, you forgot your keys!
wait, my keys? No. What?
you forgot your keys on my wife's dresser! Yeah!
Yeah, that remind you?
of course, not everyone is a born story -teller.
go with it. Run.
but Seymour said to plant a tracker.
and don't let me catch you near my wife again!
I got to tell you, this corporate-espionage stuffis kind of fun.
you know, there's no guns, no explosions.
it's like going on the kiddierides at the carnival.
so, uh, any idea how our spy got his way into the art dealer's office?
I know how I'd do it
cleaning crew comes around midnight from the service entrance here, away from the gallery cameras.
Oh, well, that's good, because then there's no door codes either 'cause the cleaning crew opens them for you.
get in, find a hiding place, let everyone clear out.
and you get the place to yourself.
as stimulating as all this is, I still don't see why you called me over here, Michael.
it always helps to bounce ideas, Fi.
uh, I'm gonna grabanother beer...
and, uh, drink iton the balcony.
is this about the other night?
is this about me not staying for breakfast?
is it so strange that I would want your opinion on a job?
look me in the eye and tell me that's all this is.
I have to go see Chandler.
you think he came in with the cleaning crew.
I can't believe I was so stupid.
whoever did this didn't come through the gallery.
there's a chance the parking-lotcameras got him at the service entrance.
I'll call the property manager, set up a time for you to stop by their office.
you really think sweeping my office is necessary?
I don't think a phone bug was the only thing your spy left you.
well, I've got dinner with a client. You let me know if you find something.
a bug, in its simplest form, is just a microphone attached to a radio.
effective but easy to detect with a frequency scanner.
a more subtle device is the wireless keylogger circuit.
nearly undetectable and easy to install, it transmits every password you type into the keyboard.
all surveillance devices, though, share a weakness -- they're machines.
when machines break, somebody has to fix them.
more spies get caught changing batteries and fixing wires than any other single activity.
Mr. Chandler. Yeah. I'm gonna need to work late tonight.
Mr. Parker.
you're the reception is there, right? What is it?
uh, Melanie. - Melanie. Right.
we need to have a conversation. - Okay.
I know this looks crazy, but, um, I can explain.
Melanie, stop. Stop.
whatever you're up to, it's not worth stabbing me with a letter opener.
don't tell Chandler! He'll kill me.
Yeah, that sounds a littlehardcore for an art dealer.
no, you don't understand.
he killed my father.
my father was J. D.Blake.
the painter? How about that?
well, Veronica was really into pop art.
you know, you could stand getting out to a few museums every so often, Mike.
Chandler was his art dealer.
trouble started over a painting called "lady in white.
bids of like $5 million,$7 million were coming in before he even finished it.
my dad's health was failing, but Chandler just kept pressuring him to finish it.
dad got sick of it, said that he was gonna get a new dealer.
Ooh, that probably stung Chandler pretty good.
the commission on $7 million --that's a lot of money.
one month later, someone broke into my dad's loft, beat him to death, and burned down his studio.
＂Lady in white"was reported destroyed.
the cops called it a burglary gone bad.
you think Chandler was behind it?
and he never put it together that you're J. D.Blake's daughter?
I grew up with my mom in New York.
I didn't even know who my dad was until about a year ago.
we talked on the phone for a couple of months.
I never got to meet him in person.
when I heard that "lady in white" was being moved on the black market,
I came down and got a job with Chandler.
I like your heart, Melanie, but, you know, that painting could be anywhere.
you get caught looking for it, you're dead.
I got to prove that Chandler's involved.
his security's good.
I thought that I would get him with that key logger thing, but I need more accesst o his files.
Melanie, I'm supposed to check the security footage from the service entrance tomorrow, the same one you used.
you told him? Look, if he sees me
I'll make sure he doesn't, provided your story checks out.
my story?
uh, don't worry about it. We'll check into it.
yo. Mike. Mikey.
looks like Melanie was telling the truth.
had to pull a few favors, but I was able to get my handson that.
an apartment lease from 1985. - Yep.
check that out J. D.Blake's signature right next to Melanie's mom's.
little loft in Soho. The math adds up, Mike. She's his daughter.
all right. Give her a call, tell her I'll help her out.
but tell Melanie she has to stop spying.
I'll handle it.
to make a magnet powerful enough to wipe a security camera tape, you need a strong power supply.
a wall outlet will do nicely if there's one available, but if you need something more portable, a car battery works in a pinch.
of course, you have to be careful to use a heavy-gauge wire if you don't want a fiery explosion that covers you in battery acid.
but do it right and you've got a magnet powerful enough to wipe any magnetic media you can manage to get close to.
Mr. Chandler said you were coming by. He had a break-in?
something like that.
we keep all the footage backed up on the hard drive there.
should go back about six months.
if you can lay off just the last few weeks to dvd, I can go through them.
sure. Or I can do vhs, not that anybody has those anymore.
that's, uh... not coming up.
what? What's wrong? How do you mean?
it's not possible. The drives --they're wiped. The footage --it's all gone.
I better tell Chandlerabout this right now.
you got a serious problem, much more serious than you led me to believe.
now, I need to know -- - Slow down. Just
you're saying the footage was erased.
I mean, could it be a screw up in the machine?
I know what it looks like when a machine screws up, and I know what it looks like when someone is erasing their tracks.
I mean, how could anyone possibly do that?
a crooked security guard, a hacker.
hell, for all I know, it could have been some guy walking in with, uh, an electromagnet.
the point is he's a professional.
you're the security expert. What do I do about it?
well, I got to start with your computers. I got to go through everything.
I got to see if your system shave been breached.
my computer files? No, no. That's private information.
do you want meto find this guy with one hand tied behind my back?
I mean, are you hoping he walks through that door, stands in front of you, and says, "hi, I'm your spy"?
call me when you're serious.
when you're playing the role of spy hunter and the person you're hunting is yourself, the trail of evidence can lead anywhere you say it does.
wait!
you really think access to the computers will help you find him?
and no one can create more fear, more paranoia, than the spy hunter.
I hope so, but I'm gonna be honest with you.
when you're dealing with someone this good, it could get a lot worse before it gets better.
so, I gave Chandler's encrypted files a deep-tissue massage.
we got his whole life here.
anything about"the lady in white"?
if he has it, he hasn't moved it yet, 'cause there's no big cash movements, and he hasn't been doing much off shore.
well, there's got to be something, Sam.
Oh, there's something, all right.
the week Melanie's dad died, Chandler's calendar had a bunch of blank spots.
so I cross-referenced that with the phone records, came up with a guy.
jacob Orr, a so-called security consultant.
he did a stintfor man slaughter.
Chandler's wet-work guy. - If I'm a betting man.
you want to make a new friend? You can take fi.
Oh, boy. You sure know how to sweeten the pot, Mike.
Hey, uh, speaking of Fi, what was that whole business at the loft, you know, with the weird energy?
Oh, no, mike. Tell me you didn't.
you did, didn't you? You did!
what? No, I don't know what you're talking about. What?
how many times do you have to touch the flame until you figure out that it burns?
you gonna help with the jobor not?
of course, but I object to the fact that you wanted me to work with her without telling me - that you were doing a little booty call. - Check!
that's our boy.
bigger in person.
recently divorced.
lives here at the hotel.
spends a good chunk of his time bouncing in and out of rehab.
looks like he's ready for another visit.
you sure you're up for this?
planting a bugin a cellphone?
you think I can't get a guy to go up to his room?
no, I'd say you have a gift for getting men to make bad choices.
michael told you. - He didn't have to.
well, don't look at me. He started it.
Fi, Mr. Orr is waiting.
for a female operative, picking a guy up at a bar is harder than it might seem.
most men have a sense for when a pickup is going too well.
if it's too easy, they get suspicious.
if it's too hard, they move on.
are you serious?
my ex was from Morris town.
your ex? That means your single now.
now, that's a leading question.
how's about I buy you another drink?
I really shouldn't.
Oh, you should.
or, uh, I could make you a drink in my room.
once an operative has a guy on the hook, she needs backup to make sure things don't go too far.
the proper sedative for cocktail hour ensures an early evening.
chloral hydrate is a mild but effective choice.
it'll do the trick... - after.
so long as the target's interested in drinking it.
what do you think you're doing?
if he's not, you have to induce unconsciousness some other way.
not with this shirt on.
I want to see these big muscles.
you got somebody outside? You set me up, bitch?
come on.
what?
Where's Michael?
make yourself right at home.
where is he?
he's out getting some yogurt. Why? What's going on?
that security footage he erased with the magnet, Chandler paid to have the drivessent out to be rebuilt!
okay, relax. That'll take a while.
reconstructing data stripped off a hard drive is kind of like putting a shredded document back together again, only different.
we're running out of time, okay? By the time he's done, I'm dead!
we're getting close, Melanie.
Chandler hired a guy to do his dirty work.
we put a bug in his phone. This is what we heard.
I'm telling you, Chandler. The bitch attacked me. She had backup.
it was probably just a robbery.
a two-man team to steal $40? I'm serious.
if somebody found out about the holding company
look, I've got all that stuff locked up in my office. Just relax.
I'll relaxwhen I got my money.
so, sounds like they set up a holding company to deal with the dirty money once they sell the painting.
so, if we can linkthese documents up connecting the two of them, that's enoughto take to the cops.
how are we gonna get them, though?
I mean, Chandler -- he doesn't even let the cleaning crew in anymore.
well, I think it's time for Chandler's spy to be more aggressive.
I mean Mike, not you.
what the hell did you get me into?
what are you talking about?
what? They broke into my home -- where I sleep, where I live.
what? You sure it wasn't
no, no. Maybe the lock on the door broke itself.
maybe my files threw themselves around!
of course I'm sure.
was there anything taken? Did he find anything
no. All the files are encrypted. They're kept off-site.
I talked to some people in the neighborhood.
they said they saw a man and a woman. It was a two-person team.
what? What is it?
a business associate of mine, he was --he was approached the same way.
I thought that he was -- - and you didn't tell me?
maybe I'm not being clear.
I need to know everything that is going on!
because now I'm involved.
whoever this guy is, he's got resources, training.
what kind of person could be -- - it could be anybody.
some spy gets blacklisted, goes freelance, he could be standing right in front of you and you wouldn't even know it.
Jesus.
I need to know what he's after.
Chandler, you have a mistress? Fudge your tax records?
steal a pack of gumin the sixth grade? You have to tell me!
it's the only way I can protect you, protect us.
no, no. There's nothing. I don't have
nothing.
okay.
uh, I'm gonna need to upgrade your system. I'm gonna lock down your office.
I need access to the camera feeds, the security codes, and the alarms.
you're gonna have to trust me. Chandler.
you with me?
Yeah.
okay, Mikey, the feeds are up.
you sure you have to go through the gallery?
Chandler's checking the service-entrance cameras. I don't have much of a choice.
I'm at the west entrance of the gallery. Tell me when to go.
okay, you are clear to get to the first column...
now.
okay, now, there's a camera on the other side of that column, and it's sweeping the north end of the gallery.
so, on my cue, I want you to go to the left.
uh, left? Uh, you sure?
Yeah, Mike, who's the guy looking at the camera here? Yeah, I'm sure.
you're fine. The cameras are moving. Moving.
here we go. 3, 2, 1...
no, no, that's my left! My left. Your right. Stop, stop. Sorry.
okay, let's try this again.
I want you to go to your left.
3... 2... 1... go.
when it comes to security, the difference between a spy and a regular thief is that a thief gets to take what he wants and run.
a spy has to go back to the scene of the crime the next day and act like nothing happened.
it makes the approach a little more delicate.
how's it going in there, Mike?
Yeah, there's nothing here but certificates of authenticity for paintings and artwork.
it's got to be here somewhere.
when you're a spy, you spend a lot of time looking for people's hiding places.
it's always good to start by searching where your target has the easiest access.
of course, smart targets don't always hide things where they have the easiest access.
after that, the search gets a little more subtle.
you look for signs of moved furniture, marks on the carpet, scuffs on the walls.
anything out of place.
I found where he's hidingthe papers, but it's an armoredfile cabinet.
well, that's no sweat. We'll just come back with a cutting torchand call it a day.
Yeah, a torch would burnthe documents.
I need something more specialized, like a diamond-tipped drill bit with a cooling system.
that sounds likea doozy, Mike.
look, I can make some calls, but it's gonna take a couple days.
let's get on it.
Melanie, we're making progress.
we should have every thing we need in a couple of days. You just need to sit tight.
sit tight?
Chandler is acting weird.
he's walking around the office, staring at all the employees, checking people's desks.
that means he's getting paranoid -- that's good.
the worse it gets, the more he turns to Michael for help.
what if he knows?
there's no way he rebuilt the security footage from those hard drives yet.
the most important thing is for you to just actcompletely normal.
pretend that nothing's going on.
I'll try. I got to run. It's nice meeting you, Fiona.
you too.
you know, pretending nothing's going on is easier for some people than others.
what have you got, Seymour?
I'll show you what I got.
tell Fiona to fire up the saab, dude. We're gonna need room for three.
your bomber is holed up in that little cottage right there.
his girlfriend went overt his morning for a little...
together time.
booby trap on the door.
I guess he's not expecting any more visitors.
that's no problem.
I got the shot guns and those breaching rounds I brought.
they'll cut through that wall like it's cardboard.
that would make a little bigger bang than we want.
the door isn't the only thing rigged to blow. Look.
I'm gonna do some scouting, figure out a better route for an approach.
man. That guy.
I mean, it's like he sees around corners, you know?
so, what's up with you two?
you're not together anymore?
we're in, uh different spaces, Seymour.
different spaces? Give me a break.
as a practitioner of Taichi, let me tell you something, Missy.
go with the flow of the universe, all right?
it's destiny, you two.
forces bigger than us.
don't argue with destiny. It will kick your ass.
believe me.
I'll keep that in mind, Seymour.
I can drink this outside if you two need some alone time.
drink it here, Sam.
so, Seymour find your bomber?
Yeah. The place he's staying at is wired to blow if we so much as knock on the window.
Yikes. Well, in other news, I got a lead on a precision drill we can use on chandler's file cabinet.
buddy's gonna give us a break.
Yeah, Melanie, what's going on?
I'm at the office. I found something.
you're at the office? You're not supposed to
I was talking to a girlfriend from work.
she told me that Chandler's secretary was shredding, like, a ton of paperwork.
but get this --the secretary didn't finish.
she left a ton of paperwork for Monday, so I've been going through the files and
you're at the office on a weekend?
if you used your employee security code, Chandler will know you're there.
what else was I supposed to do?
I mean, this stuff could begone, and then we'll never know.
Melanie, he's not gonna just leave documents lying around for someone to find.
what do you mean? - It's a trap.
he knows you're there. You need to get out right now.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god. He's here.
Melanie, listen to me very carefully. Are you in the copy room?
Yeah, I am.
get a box of paper, some duct tape, and an extension cord.
some duct tape and an extension cord?
tape the cellphoneto the top of the box and run a wire behind it, and put it in the gallery entrance.
do it now. I'm on my way. Fi, you got explosives?
I'll pretend you didn't ask that.
I have to take a more direct approach with Chandler.
I like the sound of that.
Mike, you want me to come with you?
uh, no, I want you to get in touch with Chandler's hit man.
Yeah. - It's miles Parker. Where are you?
I'm at the gallery. - Are you all right? Did they come after you?
what are you talking about? Listen, it's over.
I shredded some file sat the office today.
figured whoever's behind this might go after them. I was right.
someone came in today using an employee security code.
what's so funny?
you don't get it. They tried to kill me.
you think the spy who's doing all of this would be stupid enough to come by your office and use a security code on the weekend?
it's a trap, Chandler.
trap? What?
if you want to take another breath on this earth, do not go inside.
I'll be right there.
there was a bomb wired to my front door.
it was just dumb luck I saw it through my living-room window.
you're serious. - Do I look like I'm joking?
there it is right there. The top of the boxis a detonator. It's wired to the doors.
if you had gone inside, they'd be picking up little pieces of you from the gallery floor.
look, this is your last chance. You tell me what this guy is after, or I walk away and you handle this alone.
it's about a painting, all right?
I'm -- I'm pretty sure it's about a painting.
what painting?
it's called"the lady in white." I've been trying to move it on the black market.
it's worth $7 million. I think that's what he wants.
genius. What do you think is cheaper for him
paying $7 millionor having us killed?
so what are we supposed to do?
we need to trade the painting for our lives. Where is it?
let's just get out of her eand we can figure this out.
when you're playing the spy hunter, the goal is to get the target to trust you completely, to think of you as his only ally.
convince him that he's on the brink of disaster...
Where's that painting, Chandler?
it's at my house! It's at my house!
and he'll tell you whatever you want him to.
careful now. The last time I saw you, you got your ass kickedby a girl smaller than her.
you son of a bitch.
now, now. No need for name-calling. Feel that?
feel your thumb go snap, crackle, pop?
okay, look here.
this is what I didn't put in your scotch when you went to take a leak.
that's arsenic.
who do you think gave that to me?
who in the hell are you?
my name is Finley.
now, your buddy Chandler hired me and my partner to kill you.
if the hotel security hadn't come by, you'd be in a morgue right now.
something about selling a painting, cutting you out of the deal.
anyway, I'm only getting $10, 000to hit you.
a lousy 10 g's and that guy's pocketing millions?
and I said to myself,that's not fair.
what do you want me to do?
I tell you where he's off-loading the painting, you cut me in on the action.
of course, if not, we can go back to plan "A.
I mean, 10, 000 bucks is better than nothing.
Yeah.
where is Chandler?
you think he's been here?
hopefully, he thinks he killed you when the car blew.
what, this -- this"the lady in white"?
no, it's underneath. Give me a hand.
here. Here it is.
so now we make a deal. How are we gonna find this guy?
he's already here. - You?
that's the thing about spies -- you never know who they are.
Sam, how'd it go with Oor?
he'll be there any minute. You better get out of there, Mikey.
what are you doing here?
one of the problems with running a criminal conspiracy is that there's no real way to avoid trust issues with your co-workers.
Where's the painting?
he -- he took it. - Yeah? Who took it?
the spy!
he was here and he took it, then he -- he hit me.
if you steal with a guy, he knows you're a thief.
the spy? The spy took it?
you rip me off, you try to kill me, and you can't come up with anything better than that?
I swear to god. Please, I swear to you.
if you kill with him, he knows you're a killer.
last chance. Where is it?
no, the spy --he took it!
the spy! A spy took it!
it's a serious management issue.
well, you don't have to worry about Chandler anymore.
his partner just got arrested trying to dump his body in the Miami river.
I really don't know how to thank you guys.
I brought some cash.
uh, Melanie, I'm pretty sure you just lost your job, so...
my dad left most of his estate to an art school, but he left me a little bit.
trust me, it's cool.
and I'm not sure if you're really into this sort of thing, but...
my dad painted this the year I was born.
it's always been one of my favorites. I want you to have it.
thank you.
thanks again. - Take care.
do me a favor? Drop this off at the loft.
I have to go kidnapan explosives expert.
good luck with that.
the shot guns you requested?
modified them myself.
now, you're sure you don't want me to come up there, help you guys out, back you up?
we're fine, Seymour.
God speed.
uh, those are --they're loaded with the...
shells that I made specifically for this job.
favored by bomb squads, disrupter shells are a specially designed shot gun round filled with water.
the blast can blow an explosive device apart without igniting it.
the shells are only lethal up to about 6 feet.
at 10 feet, they just hurt a lot.
recognize me? - Yeah. You're the guy that lives over the club.
listen, I-I work for hire. It was nothing personal.
you want some of this? Huh?
because I made it special just for you.
seymour, I don't think we need that.
what do you say, Derek?
no.
answer my questions, and I'll get you and your girlfriend out of the country. Deal?
all right.
who hired you to kill me?
I don't know.
okay, Mike, look, I know you're the professional here, but I really think a little...
I-I-I never metthe guy before! He just gave me your address, and I did the job!
how did they pay you?
transferred 100 grand to an account in the caymans.
you have the account number? - Yeah.
5-1-6 -- - hold on.
go ahead.
he had me memorize it. That's all I know.
seymour, you have any, uh, gun shipments heading out to Suriname?
Suriname? Every other week.
wait, wait, wait. Suriname? Come on, man!
out of the country. A deal's a deal.
it's a beautiful place.
I don't even know where that is!
that was quick.
I got the account number used by the man who hired poole to kill me.
I just need to turn it into a name.
Hey, I'm sorry! I almost forgot.
here.
it's a little -- it's a little somethingI had made for, uh
well, it's in honor of our first operation together.
go on, open them.
matching throwing daggers.
that's... very thoughtful of you, Seymour.
and if you look, the engraving there means "destiny＂
it's a symbol of your bond.
of our bond, actually.
I made one for myself, too.
well, I better get back, you know?
don't want to leave jackass alone too long with the captive.
you know, the morning after we, uh
Yeah.
I brought you a spanishomelet, egg-white only, but you were gone.
my favorite.
maybe next timeI'll have to stay.
my name is Michael Westen. I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing -- no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
should we shoot them?
an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies --a bunch of bitchy little girls.
family, too...
Hey, is that your mom again?
if you're desperate.
someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line -- until you figure out who burned you, you're not going anywhere.
as a spy, you have a lot of ways to get information.
you can get it with a gun. You can get it with a lockpick.
you can get it with a listening device.
but most often, more than all the other information-gathering techniques combined, you get information with a free lunch.
how come you never invite me to lunch at places like this?
Oh, there's no need, Sam. You'll do almost anything for a $3 beer.
Yeah, sure.
Barry tracks down a Cayman Island bank-account number, and he gets lunch at the Chadwick?
that number leads to whoever was trying to kill me, so, yes, the Chadwick.
he's been complaining about the job for days.
Yeah, and the squeaky wheel gets the surf and turf. I see how this works.
well, at least I can get a good mojito here.
we're on a budget, Sam.
okay, Mike, you know, this cancels out one of the times you saved my life
maybe two.
how did you get this mysterious bank-account number?
you probably don't want to know.
I do. We don't have a lot of information.
well, that's why I'm coming to you. I just need a name.
Yeah, no, uh...
I understand why you hired me, Michael Westen.
but you're having me break a lot of laws with this job I'm doing for you.
when someone starts acting like there's an extra person in the conversation, it's a pretty good bet that they're wearing a wire.
this job you're doing for me?
the question, then, is who's taping you -- the police, the Feds...
I think we should talk later, maybe some place louder.
Oh, Michael, Michael, I missed you.
or a government agent you blackmailed a while back and were hoping to never see again?
Sam Axe, you're living well off a government pension, I see.
not that good. This is iced tea.
remember the file I have on you, Bly?
I think the idea was, you were never to set foot in Miami again.
I know, I know, but the sunshine, the beaches, those little Cuban pastries --come on.
I just couldn't let a blackmail threat keep me out of... paradise.
actually, at this point, blackmail ceases to be a threat.
at this point, I believe I ruin your life.
how about I give your boss a call?
I'll be honest, Michael. That file?
it -- it kept me up nights, so imagine my joy when your friend showed up on my radar investigating some highly suspicious accounts for my old pal Michael Westen.
Barry is the brick that I will tie around your neck before I throw you into that beautiful blue ocean over there.
now, how deep you sink depends on how quickly I get that blackmail file.
welcome to Miami.
so, pull the trigger.
there's enough in that file to reduce Bly's career to a smoldering crater.
he can link me to Barry, and Barry's broken a law library's worth of financial regulations looking into this account number.
if Bly goes after me with that, I can throw the rest of my life into that crater, too.
government agents have to stay within the law, but they still have plenty of options to hit you below the belt.
sometimes, a bullet to the head is a lot easier than a slow death drowning in red tape.
sorry. For your own safety.
don't touch me -- for your own safety.
according to the board of health, this loft is unfit for human habitation.
and here I thought it was just a dump.
Fiona Glenanne, you're wearing more clothes than usual.
you know, I was on the fence about that chair.
thanks for making up my mind for me.
I hope that you're on the fence about everything that you own, because toxic mold could be anywhere.
there's been reports of spores spreading to places you wouldn't believe.
Nope. No mold in that one.
try the lamp. I was always iffy on it.
you know what? Thanks for watching out for me, Bly. I'm gonna grab some clothes.
call me when you're done.
Michael, don't worry. I packed you a bag with some clothes to wear.
um, I have to say, for a tough guy, you sure dress like an Easter egg.
I hope you're not bringing toxic mold into my house.
ma, there's no mold.
I'm glad you're out of there. The place didn't sound healthy.
my friend Paula is here.
she heard you were coming over, and she wanted to talk to you.
you advised her last week about the guy she met on the internet.
I am so sorry to bother you again.
this guy, Prescott -- I did what you said, ignored his e-mails.
then he called my house.
I think he's a stalker.
he's asking all these personal questions. It's...
like he's obsessed with me.
would it make you feel better if I talked to him?
Really? You could do that?
sure. Just let me put my bag away.
that's all right. I'll put it in the guest room.
michael will take care of everything.
he lives at the Del Mar apartments.
I have his online dating profile.
I'm sure it'll be fine.
no Prescott in this building. How about yours?
uh, not unless he's disguised as an 80-year-old retiree.
I mean, this little man hunt could take a while, Mike.
Oh, whatever. Better this than sitting in my mom's kitchen watching her smoke.
likes fixing up old cars. He's a mechanic, maybe?
I mean, I can check his A.S.E. Certifications, but, of course, that's if anything on this page is true.
check out the I.P. Address on his dating-service account, see what we're dealing with.
Ooh, speaking of love, I got to get going. I have a very big date.
she made millions as a beer distributor
the woman of my dreams.
you have many women in your dreams.
Oh, so, I'm a romantic, but this one, Mike
I mean, she's got a beach house in Antigua with a quad kegerator.
that's four kegs of beer at 33 degrees, baby.
sounds like love. Hello.
Michael, it's Paula.
Prescott's outside my work. - I'll be right there.
I saw his car drive past three times.
he walked by, looking in.
I'm the assistant manager. I can't have him in here making a scene.
this is a private bank.
we're an appointment-only private bank and safe-deposit company
very exclusive, very private.
I mean, you can understand why I can't have him
has Prescott been asking you about your work, your schedule?
all of it.
I'm just afraid he's some kind of maniac.
who's that?
Oh, just an old friend.
did you get bored redecorating my place?
I'll redecorate your life if I have to.
you find that file?
not yet. Let's talk later.
actually, later is bad for me. Now is good.
I want every piece of paper you own that mentions me
files, phone records, the page in your diary where you drew little hearts around my name.
all of it.
you want to do this, Bly? You really want to go nuclear?
I'd love to.
you really think you have nothing to lose?
Michael, he's here --the stalker.
he's not a stalker.
this is a robbery.
stay quiet, follow our orders, or people die.
you'll find your cellphones are now useless.
we've blocked them, so leave them on the floor and head into the conference room.
now!
go! Go! Go! Conference room!
there are a number of different choices when you take over a building by force.
get up! Move into the conference room.
do you keep the hostages face down on the floor, or do you move them into a room together?
let me see your hands.
move. Move.
how do you cut all the lines of communication out?
give me that cellphone!
get in that conference room.
and how do you deal with the place's security method?
whatever your style, hostile takeovers are about one thing -- total dominance.
silent alarm is dead.
now get into the conference room or you will be, too.
we got the bank manager.
if we both grab guns, we can level the playing field.
uh, the playing field is covered with hostages.
make a move now, and somebody could get shot.
if we don't make a move now, we may not get a chance later.
just wait, all right?
shut up. Move back with the others.
it's all right. Just stay calm. Stay calm.
it's gonna be all r...Bly.
that's quite enough of that.
welcome to my retirement party.
I want you all to have a good time, so let's down a few ground rules, shall we?
no attacking the hosts.
no leaving early.
no calling the police.
I see one cop, I kill three of you.
I see two cops, six people die.
you can do the math.
now, mess up my party by breaking one of my rules, and...
you can expect me to overreact.
a wounded hostage is a good measure of how far a criminal's willing to go.
they either want to keep the hostage alive...
get away from him.
I'm a doctor. If I don't stop the bleeding, he'll die.
then let him die.
or they don't, which means more people are getting hurt.
you have 20 hostages in an unstable psychological state.
if they think they're going to die, they will panic, and they will fight back.
I'm just trying to make sure that you get what you want and these people stay alive.
will you please allow me to attend to this man's wound?
knock yourself out. - Thank you.
let's go take a tour of the vault. Come on.
you son of a bitch.
I only need one person alive to get me the vault-access cards.
please don't make me choose.
told you someone would get shot.
Yeah, I overestimated you.
I figured you'd back me up.
you know, it's not a good idea to insult your doctor.
okay, this wound doesn't look good. I'm going to need to...
remove the round? - Yeah.
go ahead. Come here.
I need you to apply direct, steady pressure to this.
hold this up. Hold it up. - Okay. Okay.
in a hostage situation, any idiot can steal a gun and start shooting.
it's a great way to get a bunch of innocent people killed.
keeping people alive means fighting like a spy.
where is your data server?
it's by the elevator, but they cut the power to the computers, so...
I'm using it for something else.
we need to cut through this wall and get into the next room.
from there, we can get everyone out.
there's no way out from the next room. That's just an office.
there'll be a way out. I'm working on that part.
great. You don't think the guards outside will see us going through a wall?
I'll take care of the guards.
Yeah. No. Wait. You heard him.
if you attack his guys, he's gonna start shooting people.
I'm not going to attack them.
they're just gonna have some very bad luck.
where do you think you're going?
I need medical supplies. - Wait. Wait. Stop right there.
no one leaves the conference room.
your boss saids top the bleeding.
Yeah, he didn't say you could leave.
you want to go downstairs and ask him?
the man in there is going to die unless I remove the bullet from his arm.
to do that, I need tools, so help me find tweezers and propoxyphene or shoot me in the face --your call.
you've got two minutes. - We got less than that.
fighting like a spy means disguising attacks as attempts to help.
it means making acts of man seem like acts of god.
we have to go through here?
that's the plan.
does anybody have a razor or a letter opener?
here. I grabbed these.
good. Here.
we're really gonna trust your friend on this?
he is not my friend, but he might be able to get us out of here.
sir, watch the door.
start cutting at the outlet.
cutting through a wall with scissors isn't as hard as it sounds.
start at an electrical socket and saw through the hard surface of the drywall, and the lower layers are a lot easier.
gauze, aspirin --this kit is terrible.
we're gonna need to search desks and purses for some real pain meds.
no. You can do it with that.
with gauze? Right.
Where'd you get your medical degree?
wait for the water.
I'll look through these desks and meet you back at the conference room.
what? You got armed guard sat the only exit.
you think I'm gonna fight my wayout with a stapler?
water's ready.
and look around for some towels.
in an enclosed space, getting around a cellphone jammer is a game of who's got the stronger signal.
a cellphone jammer broadcasts a powerful signal over a range of frequencies, but it can't compete with an entire ethernet wired to serve as one big antenna.
so, I said no more stress, no more work, and no more getting married.
life is too short. How many beach houses do I even need?
how many do you have? - Six.
seven? Oh, it doesn't matter. I'm always on vacation.
to me, true relaxation is a state of mind.
do you have to get that? - No. No.
you know, I like to relax, too.
Oh, you would love my place in Antigua -- hammock on the white sand beach.
clothes are optional.
excuse me.
this better be good, Mikey.
I'm at Broward private trust trapped in a bank heist.
it's Prescott. He's a pro.
his guys have killed the landlines and brought a cell jammer.
any cops, any resistance, and it gets bloody.
just tell me what you need, Mike.
I need you and Fi to blast a door to the outside
alleyside wall, 20 feet in from the north.
Alleyside wall, 20 feet in. You got it. I'm on my way.
is everything okay?
Oh, yeah. Well, uh, not really, no.
my buddy's being held hostage at a bank, and I got to bust him out.
it's true. - Well, we should call the police.
no. No. No. You can't do that.
uh, it's complicated, but there's nothing to worry about, and I'll call you later.
these are for the doc. Where is he?
go find him.
the massive air pressure that makes air hammers effective also makes them dangerous.
tamper in any way with the locking collar that holds the bit in place, and the air hammer becomes a very inaccurate gun with a single bullet.
not here. Keep looking.
mixing medications is always a bad idea, especially when one's an upper and one's a downer.
anxiety and allergy meds together are a scary combination, and that's before you add the caffeine of an energy drink.
Oh, there you are. What took you so long?
uh, I was just
this is for the pain.
who said I was in pain?
if you're not now, you will be.
by the way, that green chair in my loft -- it was my favorite.
let's go, Fi.
you're just annoyed 'cause Mike called me first and not you.
Sam, he's in the middle of a bank heist.
he's not thinking clearly.
Hey, I'm the one who should be annoyed.
I was having lunch with the woman of my dreams and had to leave.
but what are you gonna do, though?
you know, being Mike's first call is a big responsibility.
in case you're wondering, you'd be my 19th call.
I'd call Madeline before I called you.
experience with battlefield medicine may not make you as precise as an E. R.Surgeon...
Oh, come on.
but after you've stitched up a few people under artillery fire, you can handle outside pressure.
almost.
got it.
Oh, god.
we're making some progress on the wall, but they're checking on us.
we need maybe 20 minutes.
you've got to go faster. Keep working.
they're emptying the vault downstairs.
they're taking everything.
how long before they clear it all out?
I don't know. There's hundreds of safe-deposit boxes down there.
and he wasn't lying about the silent alarm.
no call went out.
no help is coming.
hide the hole.
Prescott wants you downstairs. Let's go.
Thanks.
michael said 20 feet in from the street?
are you sure? - Positive.
well, what's the signal? How are we timing this?
he didn't say.
he didn't say? - He's Mike. He's improvising.
michael called you to tell you to blow a hole in the wall of a bank, and you didn't think to ask when?
look, it was a brief conversation.
we didn't talk about shoes or movies either.
could you just place the explosives already?
fix him. - What happened?
the air hammer broke, and the piston came off in his leg.
keep him alive.
I'm gonna give you something for the pain, all right?
people are too trusting when it comes to pills.
they'll take whatever a doctor hands them.
I need to cauterize the wound.
I need to use your liquid-nitrogen gun.
you need to use something else.
like what? Did you bring an electrosurgical generator?
liquid nitrogen can cool a wound to 150 below, freezing the cells and cutting off blood flow.
tie this around his leg, tight.
either help me or get me someone who will.
up here?
supercooling also damages metal.
freeze the inside of a gun, and the next time it gets hot, it'll rip apart as if it's loaded with the wrong ammo.
Prescott, get up here.
we've got trouble in the conference room.
Where's the knife? - There's no knife. There isn't a knife.
this guy was trying to cut into the office next door.
come here.
what did I tell you about the rules, huh?
please, I --I have a wife. I have kids. They need their father.
I'm begging you.
look, if I make an exception, I mean, what kind of message does it send?
wait. Wait. You got the wrong guy.
it was me.
just can't stop causing trouble, can you, huh? Huh?
should've done this the first time.
God!
shoot him!
move!
you got metal shards in your hand. You're gushing arterial blood.
I'm the only guy here who can save your hand, probably your life.
tell your man to back off or find another doctor.
come with me. Get the rest of them downstairs.
Hey, we're running about 20 minutes late. Should I call the boat?
I-I still need to -- - get downstairs.
how's your escape plan going?
we're not getting out. I'm working on plan "B.
I need your help. Do you trust me?
I need you to collapse in that doorway. Sell it. Buy me time.
Oh, no.
what's going on?
I think he's going into shock. I can't move him. I'll need a couple of minutes.
you got one.
Mike, let's get this done. I got a beer-drinking angel to get back to.
you ready to rock?
forget the escape plan.
Prescott's moving everybody downstairs.
these guys are calling a getaway boat on walkies.
if you can listen in, locate the signal.
maybe we can get some leverage.
I'll try to keep people from getting hurt in here.
all right.
elevators have so many safety devices that they're easy to sabotage.
disable any part, and the entire system shuts down.
locate the getaway boat. That's our plan.
this is Miami.
look, we just need to find the frequency that Prescott's walkies are on.
I still think we should set off the charges, blow a hole in the wall, rush in.
beats waiting out here. - Yeah, that's great.
let's get Mike and the hostages killed because you have the attention span of a 3-year-old.
elevator's busted.
you're lucky.
I don't see any shrapnel, and no bones look damaged.
use the word lucky again, I'm gonna put a bullet in your head.
hold still. I need to sterilize the wound.
this bank!
it's cursed.
that's it, isn't it?
it's cursed.
my gun, the air hammer, the elevator -- what's wrong with this place?
I'm gonna need more tape and a splint.
I think there's something I can use upstairs.
do you need any meds?
what do you think, huh?
let me blow your hand off and find out if you need something for the pain.
Angela, hey, it's Sam. How you doing?
is your friend okay?
uh, well, he's still trapped inside, but it's kind of a quiet time, so I thought I would just call and say hi. So...
I know this quiet spot that makes great a mojito.
well, I-I-I was meeting a friend, but
playtime's over.
uh, Angela, I got to run. Hey, don't make any plans. I'll call you back.
sounds encrypted.
so I was wasting my time while you were buttering up your bimbo?
look, we got the frequency.
there can't be that many marinas around here in range of their walkies.
okay, that's not good.
those cops start asking questions out that truck out front, hostages are gonna die.
one of us needs to distract the cop, and the other one needs to track down the getaway boat.
and here I forgot to shave my legs.
delivery trucks.
Hey, stop! Give me that! - No!
she is stealing my tip jar!
this is compensation for you leering at me.
you should arrest her. Es una ladrona!
you should arrest him for sexual harassment.
we're not arresting anyone.
you're just gonna stand there while I'm being objectified?
I say we go to the station, hash this out -- you, me, him. What do you say?
unit 204, this is dispatch. Got a domestic disturbance at Ocean and 4th. You close?
10-4. I'm on my way.
if you'd like to file a report, you should go down to the police station, okay?
una cortadito, por favor.
we win yet?
I'm working on it. I need some meds. Things okay?
Yeah, hey, it's Miami.
the sun, the girls --what's not to love?
if something bad starts happening, make your move.
Yeah. These should do the trick.
life with a hypochondriac mother gives you a useful knowledge of pharmaceuticals.
those are for pain?
in low doses, pilocarpine cures dry mouth.
I'll take them after you do.
in high doses, it has roughly the same effect as a sarin gas attack.
satisfied?
see what happens to you first.
still want that splint for your hand?
sure.
Hey, we're going upstairs.
you, keep an eye on the hostages.
back in a minute.
Hey, what's it mean if my fingers are feeling numb and I'm getting sort of nauseous?
do you have a headache, any palpitations, any tingling, been drinking caffeine?
Yeah. Why? Is that bad?
sounds pretty serious. I should check you out.
I'm just gonna take your pulse. I'm just taking your pulse.
that's it. That's it. I'm just taking it.
in a weakened state, you want to avoid pressure on your carotid artery.
block the blood flow to your brain, and you black out in four seconds.
the coating on tablets and medicine keeps them from dissolving in your stomach right away, which buys you a little time to find some privacy and do the only safe thing
get them out of your system.
Oh, hey, buddy.
Hey, I'm supposed to repair a radio in a guy's boat, but I'm late, and I forgot the slip number.
is there somebody hanging around his boat kind of looking pissed?
end of the pier.
Thanks. You have a good one.
vault's cleared out. It's about time.
let's put everyone in the vault and get the hell out of here.
everyone in the vault now.
they've seen our face. They die.
let's go. Everybody into the vault.
there isn't much air in the vault. We're all gonna suffocate.
should we attack them?
no, not yet.
I don't know how long we can wait.
just trust me.
Hey, Mike, I'm at the marina looking at the getaway boat.
Sam, we got any moves here?
Prescott's shoving everyone into the vault, and no one's walking out.
well, you want to ask Prescott if he'll trade his hostages for the boat driver?
not likely.
what about a little operation quicksilver?
quicksilver --you mean like world war II?
you're talking about a bunch of fake tanks and the whole Normandy invasion force.
Yeah, but instead ofthe Normandy invasion force, I have a walther with one bullet.
you got to sell this, Sam.
you got to sell it like you've never sold it before.
that's the kind of pep talk I like, Mikey.
I'm on it.
Sam, hi. I-I-I was calling to leave a message.
I think your life is -- is a little too fast-paced for me.
Oh, no. No. No. That's not true at all.
why are you whispering?
are you still outside the bank?
no. No, I'm at a marina.
just taking a stress-free walk along the ocean, the breeze blowing in my hair.
I might even get a tropical drink.
hands in the air.
a stress-free walk.
well, as much as I hate to admit it, Angela, you're probably right.
we're just not meant to be.
enjoy one of those beers in Antigua for me.
you bastard. You ruined something special.
if you have one bullet and you need to take down three armed guys in close quarters, you're betting your life on a lot of lucky breaks.
it's the kind of bet you don't want to make unless you have to.
there you are.
your guy had a stroke in the kitchen.
he needs immediate medical attention.
you want me to put him in the vault or just take care of him right here?
you're not listening to me.
either you get your friend into an ambulance with the proper meds, or he's not gonna make it.
well, I guess he's not gonna make it, and neither are you.
what's going on?
Prescott, they're at the boat.
they shot me. Why didn't you tell us?
why didn't I tell you what?
who we were robbing.
why didn't you tell us who owned the bank?
Oh, my god. You didn't know, did you? We're dead.
Oh, my god.
they're coming back.
they're coming back.
we're all dead! We're all dead!
was it dumb luck that you chose my bank, or did you and your buddies decide that today was a good day to make the worst mistake of your lives?
who is this?
that's not important --what's important is that you and your friends are robbing my bank, and no one
I mean no one --does that to me.
so, you think you got yourself a good plan with your getaway truck and your boat?
well, I got a plan, too.
if there is a scratch on anyone in my bank, you will all die.
if there is a single dollar missing from my vault, you all die.
you hearing this?
if there is a single hostage taken, you will all die.
in fact, if you do anything other than walking out of my bank alone right now, you will all know such pain as you have never imagined.
so, who the hell is that guy?
he owns this bank?
he's lying.
I looked up everything about this bank.
well, you obviously didn't look up enough.
what did you get us into?
how does he even know we're here?
shut up.
it's not important!
one evening, a patient was brought into my clinic in the middle of the night.
he was tortured so badly I couldn't believe he was still breathing.
a man was with him.
it was the man on your radio.
I'll never forget the voice.
he put a gun to my head and explained to me that my patient had robbed him and that he wanted me to save him so the pain would last longer.
I did what I could.
he said to come here for my money -- my blood money.
there's a place between life and death.
amazing how long a man can linger there.
that's enough, all right? Okay.
bring everything upstairs.
we're getting out of here.
Tony? Tony, can you hear me?
what the hell is going on?
I know this guy.
he'll have people outside the bank, in your truck, and on your boat.
you have no idea who you're dealing with.
shut your mouth. We've got the money.
that's just some voice on the radio.
Yeah, but he's a voice on our radio.
he's on our boat!
how does that happen?
what happened to the guys in the vault, huh?
he's -- he's talking about our truck!
there's nothing wrong with our truck!
let's just get out of here!
nothing's wrong with the truck?
does that look like nothing?
pick up the bag.
no way. I am gonna...
unbelievable.
just not your day, I guess.
drop it! Drop it! Hands on your head!
so, where were we?
I think we were deciding whether we were going to destroy each other.
well, you've already had enough opportunities to let me die.
maybe I just like the challenge.
I'm gonna go pass out at the local E.R.
and when I wake up, I'll take care of the loft and the thing with Barry.
as long as you're in a helpful mood, you think I could add one more favor to the list?
then they moved us into the vault.
we knew there wasn't much time.
I mean, I really thought it was the end, but your son and Mr. Bly were so brave, Madeline.
Michael, what are you doing?
I left something in here.
you just assumed I was never gonna broil anything?
well, so far I've been right.
Prescott will be leaving you alone from now on.
you might want to select your dates a little more carefully in the future.
I will. Thank you so much.
Bye, honey. - Bye.
I'm off, too.
what? You -- you're going?
you -- you didn't even spend the night.
I resolved my toxic-mold issue.
board of health says my place is safe again.
Oh, okay.
I was thinking of ordering takeout, but if you're going...
actually, I don't have to leave right away.
takeout sounds good.
Bly says you're off the hook.
he was just using you to get under my skin anyway.
listen, Michael, I feel really bad about the whole tacky business with the wire.
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I love how I look with a shaved chest, but rolling over on you...
I ask you to take risks. It comes with the territory.
but next time, we'll have a signal.
if you're wired, tip me off by offering to pay for lunch.
perfect. You know, I think I'm gonna get out of town for a bit.
I got to decompress. - Sounds good. Stay safe.
all right, man.
Hey, I had to take the guy on the boat down, get him to say the right things at the right time.
while you were putting on a show, I got rid of the cops, and I wired a truck to blow.
Mike, back me up.
I mean, I think it's pretty clear my tactical maneuverings pretty much saved the day here.
you feeling underappreciated?
Oh, no. He appreciates himself plenty.
he's been insufferable ever since you called him first yesterday.
Fi, look, don't be insulted.
you're good with the hands-on stuff -- the simple mechanical things.
simple? Like wiring a truck to blow?
an important task, yes, but one a very intelligent monkey could perform.
I'm just saying there's a reason why I'm number one on the speed dial.
Sam, for your information, I called Fi first.
you didn't pick up, so in the future, I'm gonna call Sam first.
it's all the originals --everything I had on you.
I love your attention to detail, Michael.
this would have been quite the career-ender.
well, I know a little something about that...
although I wasn't expecting you to counter with even better leverage -- well-played.
this would be a good Michael Westen story if people were allowed to tell Michael Westen stories.
so... - so.
any luck trucking down that cayman islands account?
look, I don't have to tell you, we have ways of investigating that most people don't know about.
no one has the reach that we do, but this...
I found the bank and I even found the banker, but the account
it's just a number.
no name? No organization?
nothing. It gets worse.
that account was being monitored -- an electronic trip wire of sorts.
and you think you tripped it?
might have been me. It might have been Barry.
look, whoever you're looking for, they know you're coming.
good luck.
my name is Michael Westen. I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing -- no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend... - should we shoot them?
an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies --a bunch of bitchy little girls.
family, too...
Hey, is that your mom again?
if you're desperate.
someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line -- until you figure out who burned you, you're not going anywhere.
let me tell you a story.
it starts with me nearly getting blown up.
you remember that, right?
well, the way the door was rigged, I realized the bomber had to leave from the balcony.
sure enough, the security camera down the block caught him on tape.
hold that!
he was a hard man to find.
but eventually we connected.
turns out he was a hired gun.
good guy, really gave me a lead on the offshore bank that paid him.
I tried to follow the money, but that turned out to be a dead end.
whoever tired to kill me, he's paranoid, careful, and he knows I'm close.
that is quite a mouthful, Michael.
thank you, Carla.
you know, I'd love to believe you.
I'd also love to know why somebody who's normally so careful to keep his mouth shut has suddenly blossomed into such a storyteller.
you blaming me for playing this close to the vest?
it was a leak in your organization that nearly got me killed.
I need you to back off.
I can't draw him out with the suits-and-sunglasses crowd following me around.
you can have more leash if your story checks out, but if you hold back on me, Michael
you'll go after my family, kill me?
talking with you is always such a pleasure.
you have a nice day, Carla.
you didn't tell her it was victor, did you?
the man has tried to kill you twice, and you're protecting him.
he's the one enemy I know Carla has.
I'd like to at least talk to him before I turn him in.
you think he'll stop trying to kill you long enough for the two of you to grab lunch and have a chat?
everybody loves a free lunch.
can you show this around in areas victor might be laying low
cash motels, campsites?
okay, I'll tell people he's wanted in connection with a dog-fighting ring.
they'll call.
Hi, mom.
don't "hi, mom" me.
you drag me out of my house at a moment's notice, and you can't even botherto pick me up yourself?
you had to send Sam? - No offense. None taken.
I'm just trying to lock things down as fast as I can.
it's just a little dangerous right now.
how dangerous, Michael?
just a bad guy in town.
but you don't have to evacuate. You just have to... stay here with me.
with you? Here? In this dump?
what?
Sam, you forget to lock the front gate? - No.
Sam. - Yeah, mike?
he was talking to me.
who are you?
I'm Samantha.
michael and I used to be engaged.
for a spy, compartmentalizing is second nature.
information is given on a need-to-know basis.
in your professional life, this approach keeps you safe.
in your personal life, it can be dangerous.
so, uh, another Sam.
this is gonna be confusing, huh?
have you ever been secretly engaged to my son? - No.
then I think we'll be able to tell you apart.
fair enough.
I can't believe it. No, I-I can believe it.
it's just like Michael.
look, ladies, don't be too hard on Mike.
I'm sure there's a very good reason why he never mentioned her before.
I mean, you know, these things just happen sometimes.
anybody else need a drink? No? Okay.
Michael, is everything
sorry, it's just not the best time to be popping in out of the blue.
why are you so paranoid?
thought you were out of the spy game.
Yeah, that's the problem.
how did you find me?
your mom's in the book. - I'm not.
she had your address in her kitchen drawer.
sorry. I just needed to find you.
I didn't think you'd ever want to see me again.
I didn't have a choice.
I'm in a lot of trouble, Michael. I could use all the help that I can get.
his name is Tyler Brennen, a black-market trader.
used to work in military intelligence.
that's him right there on the balcony.
evil son of a bitch.
about a month ago, he came to me with a job offer.
what line of work are you in, Sam?
acquisitions.
no need to be coy, dear. If you're a thief, say you're a thief. You're among friends.
brennen wanted me to rob AFC industries.
it's a defense contractor here in Miami.
the prize was a state-of-the-art guidance chip
something to do with U.A.V. Spy drones.
U.A.V. Drones? Tell me you passed on the job.
well, I tried to.
okay, Mike, I'm sorry, but I can't help steal military technology.
I shouldn't even be hearing about it. - I don't need help stealing it.
Oh, come on! I thought this was a "get to know the ex" lunch.
now it's a "19 government agencies are chasing me" lunch? - No, no, I -- I got away clean.
but when they realize it's missing, they're gonna know it was me.
how? - I had to get a job working there to get access.
my key-card activity will give me away.
I'm new, I went in at night, and if you check my history, you'll see that
Sam, why would you -- - I didn't have time to do it any other way.
brennen kidnapped my son. This is the ransom.
you have a son?
Charlie's 9.
when did you -- - is he...
no.
no, he's not. But he needs you.
when I think about what might happen to him, I...
what do you want us to do?
the trade's tomorrow.
I don't want to give this to Brennen, but I need my boy back.
please.
the site of a deal can tell you a lot about who you're doing business with.
if it's private, they value control.
if it's public, they want to get in and out anonymously.
if they've somehow found a site that gives them both...
you're dealing with somebody who really knows what he's doing.
we're all clear for now.
place is a nightmare, Mike.
I mean, you got tons of foot traffic outside here.
we got so many approaches, we'll never see him coming.
if we can't jump him on his way in, we're gonna have to let her make the trade.
are you crazy?
putting military hardware into this guy's hands?
do you see another way?
there's a kid involved.
nobody wants him to get hurt.
I'm just saying, we got to get that chip back in the right hands and soon.
otherwise, they're never gonna stop looking for Samantha.
Sam, you go with Samantha, oversee the hand-off.
brennen won't expect you, but he won't blow the deal over a little backup.
Fi, you set up with a view of the meeting.
when you see that Charlie's safe, give me the signal.
I'll take Brennen down on his way out.
I know I owe you some answers. - You don't owe me anything.
I knew Samantha before I met you.
we were in St. Petersburgin '97.
she was helping me on a job, and things moved, uh, quickly.
then I realized we didn't have what we needed to make it last.
what was that -- trust? You know, let's not do this now. We have a job to do.
I've always wanted to tell you. I was just waiting for the right time.
well, it wasn't the right time when we met, it wasn't the right time when we started dating, and it wasn't the right time when I moved to Miami.
no, it was the right time to tell me when she showed upon your front step.
that about right?
so, four iced teas? I'm not that late. You're hiding out.
is Madeline still pissed?
I don't want to talk about it.
okay, all right.
look, Mike, I know you've been a little wound up, so I brought a little present, something to cheer you up.
Oh, no, no, no. This is way too good. I'm gonna do a show-and-tell.
buddy of mine did some research on Victor.
Victor stecker-epps. I mean, he's got a last name like a female middle-distance runner, but this is a bad man, Mike --black-ops hard-ass.
you're not the first guy he tried to kill, either, just the first one he missed.
it's a great read.
if Carla's people burned him, it's all fiction.
how did he get burned? - Good question.
july '04 -- things get a little bloody down Mexico way.
Victor denied the hits, but a guy named Philip Cowan burns him anyway.
five years working for Carla alone.
I have a hunch he's ready to make a friend.
Mike, I don't know. This one, you should be careful.
I mean, if half this crap is true, victor's a lot like you, only with, you know, rabies.
mom, I didn't think you'd still be up.
obviously.
mom, what can I say? I'm sorry you have to stay here.
Jesus, Michael.
that's not what you should be sorry for.
Samantha. I was getting to that.
mom, I'm sorry.
it just never came up. It was a long time ago.
you know, so was world war II, but they still talk about it.
I want to know about the woman who almost married my son.
uh, she is a pisces, she does "security,
and she hasn't been in my life in a decade.
and she has a son who's been kidnapped.
Sam told me.
is he yours, Michael? - I don't know.
but I'm gonna get him back.
Hello? - Michael?
you're gonna have speak up! I can barely hear you!
Victor, sounds like you're enjoying Miami.
well, nothing like a near-death experience to get the juices flowing.
am I right, or am I right?
I'm trying to cut back, myself.
is that why you didn't shoot at me the other night? Or were you trying to make friends?
what's going on in that pretty head of yours?
vic, we have so much in common, so much to talk about. Let's get together.
I love it. Let's do it.
when and where? I'll be there.
Yes, you will be, but let's make that a surprise, all right?
Victor -- - I'll see you soon, sport.
I promise.
tell me what you see, Fiona.
old Sam looks sweaty. - Fi.
just trying to cut the tension, Michael.
wait. There's Brennen. He used a southwest approach.
well, I'm in position. If he doesn't leave this way...
he'll have to get past me.
come alone" -- I guess that was too hard to understand.
who's your friend, Sam?
call me Chuck. It'll be less confusing.
I'm just here to make sure everything goes smoothly.
well, Chuck, number one, rsvp next time, and number two, shut up.
I was talking to her. The chip -- let's see it.
Where's my son? Where's Charlie?
trust me. I'm not looking to adopt. I'm looking to retire.
but you don't see him until I see the chip.
most black-market transactions tend to go the same way.
first, payment is inspected.
then, the goods are brought to the table.
this standard sequence is meant to ensure both parties against a blown deal, Curley!
but...that doesn't stop some people from bringing a little extra insurance.
Charlie! - Mom!
Charlie. Oh, come here, honey. Come here.
he's fine. His arm is fine. Whether it stays that way is up to you.
what did they do to you?
Sam, be careful. That's not just a cast. - No.
see, you can't trot a kid out in public with a bomb strapped to his arm, but I had this nifty idea
molded plastic explosive under the fiberglass, radio detonator with a mile radius.
you can cut it off in 10 minutes.
I'd appreciate it if you'd wait to start until I'm safely away.
Hey, guys, thanks. It's been a real pleasure.
Michael! - I got him.
no, stand down. - Does he have the chip?
something's wrong, Michael. Let him go. You've got to let him go.
this isn't the airport.
no, it's not.
Michael, I -- - Samantha, the guidance chip you stole isn't just expensive.
it's worth lives, and when they realize it's gone, you're gonna have every security service in the western hemisphere after you.
the engineer that built it is at a conference in Tokyo.
he doesn't get back until Friday. I figure that's a pretty good head start.
I could fall off the grid, start over.
you could. What about him?
you want Charlie celebrating his 8th birthday in a hut in Nicaragua?
you really didn't think I'd notice he's not old enough to be mine?
told you he wasn't yours.
you let me believe he might be.
so, what? You never stretched the truth just a little bit to help an innocent person?
come on, Michael. I don't want to run. I don't.
I had every intention of putting it back, but, I mean, it's gone.
no, it's not. We have till Friday.
I'm gonna get it back and help you return it.
and how do you propose to do that? - Don't --don't say "propose.
what, she lock you out?
no, I'm just getting some fresh air.
your mom's a chimney, Mike.
Plus, little miss commando here is getting all worked up about an armed assault on Brennen's condo.
he strapped a bomb to a kid.
how is Charlie?
he'll be fine. Sam's got family in Chicago. He'll be safe there.
I lent her my carto bring him to the airport.
you think she'll bring it back?
well, she is a professional thief.
jealous, Fi? - Don't be absurd. I'm not jealous.
you think you could pretend to be?
some cover I.D.S are about blending in.
others are about making a splash.
it all depends on whether it's more important to fool your target or impress them.
Hey, fellas, just give me a sec.
it's okay, Curley.
these two are just showing me they're mysterious, dangerous types that can break into my apartment.
I should take them seriously.
that's the idea here, right?
of course, if your target has a background in intelligence, you often can't fool or impress them.
in that case, the best cover I.D.Is none at all.
I'm Michael. I used to work in covert ops. This is Fiona.
and you're here to help me pack?
that's really sweet, guys.
uh, the furniture stays. It's a rental.
we have a mutual acquaintance.
acquaintance? - Fi.
she's upset about the deal that you two just did.
she came to me for help.
that thing she stole -- she's planning on stealing it back.
I'll bite. You're telling me this because...
Samantha and I used to work together.
Samantha and Michael slept together.
we -- we worked most of the time.
anyway, everything she knows, she learned from me.
all I learned from her is I can't trust her.
and Michael's now moved on, and I don't like to share.
and I figured we could take care of our problem and yours.
we're willing to help for the right price.
pass. Even if I bought your tale, which I really don't,
I think I can handle a single mom on my own, spunky though she may be.
I know Samantha a little bit better than you do.
my money's on her.
Samantha told us that she kept a piece of your little doodad.
you try to unload it, your buyer's either gonna kill you or make you fix it.
and either way, she gets another shot.
you're gonna have to have it tested. I know people who can do that.
I'm, uh, just thinking out loud here, but if I wanted to steal a really valuable object, going in as a helpful soul volunteering to test it might be my first move.
convince me you're on my side, and, hey, guys, it's a solid plan.
one little cave at -- I... don't... believe you.
fine. Check us out.
I'm Michael Westen, she's Fiona Glenanne, and you need our help.
if you're as smart as you think you are, you'll call us.
looks like he's planning on using the cash from the sale to disappear.
anybody who's ever touched that chip will be hunted across borders. He has to run.
well, he doesn't need to run to Nicaragua.
with the money he can get for that chip, he can buy Nicaragua.
well, that's why he can't ignore a threat like you.
if you rob him, sabotage the goods, he'll have to run with nothing.
Oh, he'll call.
I think.
well, if he doesn't, there's always tear gas and a battering ram.
Ooh, my ride is here.
Michael's other woman beckons.
I never actually thought I'd look forward to this.
excuse me.
Oh, Michael. You forgot something.
that's just a little game the two of us used to play.
it's charming.
are you and Michael... - no.
I have to admit -- you've restored a little of my faith in your abilities.
I take it my story checked out.
you keep this up, and you may just be our next employee of the month.
how about you keep the plaque and give me my life back instead?
you think you're kidding.
give us the man who killed our operatives, and you and I can have a little chat about your future.
show me you can keep your promise.
I've started to see guys like them in my sleep.
back off, and I'm telling you, this guy will make his move.
we'll leave you alone to work, but I can't give you much more time, Michael.
Management's... getting anxious.
tell them I know the feeling.
Hello?
michael Westen, I've been thinking about your proposal.
I think we should talk.
why don't you come by around 4: 00?
knock this time.
I checked you out.
some of the stories I heard, I should actually have a higher caliber, probably.
you decide to test the chip?
I sure did. - Fine. I'll set it up.
I made my own arrangements, thank you.
but I thought it'd be a good idea to have you two where I could see you while I did it.
my friend here is gonna take your cellphones, and we're gonna take a ride together.
for the record...
pumpkin, I'm exactly as smart as I think I am.
uh, testing guy, spies. Spies, testing guy.
what's going on? - Everything's fine.
you're keeping it in the Caribbean? A little humid out theref or such delicate electronics.
the Caribbean?
no, uh, not gonna take that chance with guys like you around.
it's in the air 23 hours a day.
I know what you're thinking, Fi. Not yet.
that's not what I'm thinking. We've got a visitor.
I have to say, his timing's perfect.
so?
I can't vouch for performance, but the parts are all there.
off you go.
so, the chip is fine...
which means your offer to test it is looking less fine.
Samantha lied to me. If you knew her, you wouldn't be surprised.
it's all so confusing -- her lying to you, you lying to me.
who can keep it straight?
you know, I think a couple of bullets in the back of both of your heads is gonna simplify things a lot.
Yeah, well, it'll certainly simplify things for Samantha.
please, Fiona. I think I know who the thieves are here.
Really? The guy at the fenceline on the blue pickup truck?
you can do better than that.
friend of yours? - My friends don't watch me being executed.
Samantha's scouting you.
you think it's a coincidence that that guy's there at the same time the chip's out in the open?
do you believe me now? - Not really.
get in the car.
I want 5% of the sale price to provide security against Samantha.
make no mistake -- she's coming, and you'll need the help.
I'll hear you out. No guarantees.
listen, first of all, you're selling the chip at the airport, the one place she knows about.
you're doing half of her job for her.
well, aren't you Mr. Helpful?
the location is a challenge we're just gonna have to overcome, because my buyers aren't the sort of people you call up and say,"oh, hey, uh, change of plans.
here's the deal -- you can help me with my Samantha problem, period.
works out, you get paid.
how do I provide security with you tying my hands?
God, I'm gonna miss this table.
lock down the hangar.
you said you taught her everything she knows.
think about what you'd do and then what you'd do to stop that.
but we're doing the deal with my buyers in my hangar, where I'm in control.
understand? Lock it down. - Understood.
okay, so, there's no way to get to the chip before the sale, no way to move the sale, no way to delay the sale.
that South American hut's starting to look better and better.
what we're left with is snatch-and-dash at the airport when the sale goes down.
sounds messy. Brennen's gonna have that place locked down tight.
well, at least I'm in charge of the lockdown.
we're gonna have a lot of eyes on us, but we might be able to sneak in some special construction materials.
like we did in Dublin? - Yeah.
she talking about that thing you and I did in St. Petersburg?
Yeah.
I should take this.
and I'm gonna leave... now.
well, you are an enigma wrapped in a schizophrenic, aren't you, sport?
first you don't shoot at me, and then you set up a little firing squad.
I needed help selling a cover I.D.-- Nothing personal.
Oh, we do have some fun, don't we?
I really do want to get together. How soon can we do this?
if you give me till Friday, I think I've got a way to make sure guns stay out of the equation.
didn't mean to startle you.
now I know where Mike gets his stealth.
Samantha, I know you're busy, but when this is over,
I would love to take you to lunch, just to chat.
now, that he didn't get from you. - What?
well, he's not exactly the chatty type, your son.
no, guess he's not.
he failed to mention that he had proposed to you.
actually, I proposed to him.
Really?
if you don't mind... what happened?
I'm not really sure. We had fun.
Mike was the first guy who really understood me.
then one day, it was just over. Never knew why.
he just said goodbye, and, uh, he was gone.
Yeah, that sounds like Michael.
from private homes to financial institutions to military encampments, security consulting is a multibillion-dollar industry.
and while security consultants constantly tout new materials and technology, the basic techniques haven't changed in 4, 000 years
get a better view of any danger headed your way, make your walls sturdier...
and arm yourself well enough to fend off attacks.
hardening a target against attacks from outside is pretty straightforward...
which is why it's usually best to attack from inside if you can.
darling, are you ready to watch me become rich?
I'm gonna relish this.
Oh, what the hell? This is not good.
if that plane doesn't come to us, we got to go to it.
what if the buyers show?
we improvise. We're gonna need a car. - Sam!
Yeah, that's far enough.
you can't be serious. You're not gonna leave the plane out in the open like this.
it's not that I don't appreciate all your work on the hangar.
I just like to change things up.
Brennen, you don't understand.
no, you don't understand.
either your security worked and it scared Samantha away -- in which case, I don't need it
or it didn't scare her away, she's ready for it, and I don't want it.
Hola, amigos!
now what?
come on! Do you see? What did I tell you?
how did they get into the airport?
I locked down the hangar!
I didn't lock down the airport!
I thoughtI almost missed my ride.
you said Samantha was gonna try to steal the chip.
did that looklike a robbery to you?
Jesus, you're supposed to be smart!
the only way out for Samantha was to steal the chip and put it back.
when she couldn't do that, she knew they'd find her.
so, she did the next best thing.
she took you down with her.
you wanted to buy a mansion and a private army in somenon-extradition country?
if I'm not mistaken, your money just left with your buyer.
good luck finding a new one.
FBI, C.I.A. NSA --they'll all be on high alert.
and after that, in less than 24 hours.
you used to work with Samantha.
you said you were better than she was. That's what you told me, right?
I am.
you can put the chip back at AFC, and nobody will notice it's gone.
how stupid do you think I am?
this is what you want --this, right here.
you get the chip. I have to give it to you. I have no choice.
this is what you want. Am I right?
Yeah, you're right. You've got no choice.
you're either gonna be killed or serving a life sentence by the end of the week unless the chip goes back.
it doesn't matter what you believe, Brennen.
there's one move for all of us -- put the chip back.
and unless you know somebody else who can do that...
if you try to sell the chip, if you don't put it back, I will find you.
and no clever story you're gonna tell is gonna stop me from blowing your brains out of the back of your skull.
do we understand each other?
welcome to AFC industries.
we manufacture satellite-and missile-tracking systems, we design U.A.V. Guidance chips, and sometimes we accidentally hire thieves.
that's the clean room. That's where the chip has to go.
the engineer that built it comes back tomorrow.
he's got a presentation on the chip at 3: 00.
well, then, that's our deadline.
we put it back, Brennen's on the run from his nasty South American friends, and we're good to go, so long as we don't hit any snags.
show me the snags.
card reader up front.
now, assuming they haven't updated their employee files, I can get us through.
we'll dummy up an I.D. That says you work with me.
handprint reader here?
Yeah. Yeah, but that's not the problem.
the problem is the clean-room door.
it's got a keypad that has a 9-digit access code, changed weekly.
took me 45 minutes to hack it in the middle of the night.
today we won't have 5.
I mean, there's no way we can get out clean in that kind of time.
then I guess we'll just have to get out dirty.
no large security building is designed to be 100% secure.
doing business requires flexibility to deal with visitors, repairman, contractors, et cetera.
getting in, then, requires using that flexibility.
I need your I.D.S.
he's got a temporary pass. I'll sign him in.
and would you mind calling down and just letting them know that we're gonna be by to set him up as a vendor?
Yeah, no problem.
can you get me a raise while you're at it?
you have to make everybody think you're someone else's problem.
even advanced security measures are useless when people leave their keys lying around.
and surprisingly often, that's what people do.
people leave their key cards in purses, their passwords on desks, and their handprints on soda cans.
Ooh, you want some? He left a little.
I'm fine.
diet mountain dew. - We don't have much time.
shall we do our bunny suits?
you know, if you're shy, we can break into the ladies' changing room just up the hall.
Oh, we can do this.
past a certain point in a clearance facility, you stop seeing security cameras.
lowly security guards don't have the clearance to see what's on the cameras, so there's no one to monitor them.
usually, in the top security areas of a high-tech facility, it's less about monitoring and more about fortification.
and here we are.
so, tell me, Michael, what exactly do we have planned here?
it's a shape charge.
the det cord explodes.
and the reinforced polyester from the hose shapes the blast, and -- you'll see.
well, it's nice to see you've learned some new tricks since the last time I saw you.
I would stand back.
in a high-security situation, most people try to create the smallest disturbance they can.
the thing is, high security is built to deal with small disturbances.
trip one sensor, and you're toast.
trip 100 sensors, though, and nobody knows what to do.
these look expensive.
what? What are you doing?
it's got to look like we broke in for a reason.
we're trying to get everyone out of here in an orderly fashion.
please have your bags ready for inspection.
you really think they're gonna buy that someone went through all this trouble just for some lenses?
I don't think they're going to know what to make of this.
nothing major's missing.
hopefully, they'll double the security, keep people like you out.
speaking of that --the bag?
the bag? What do you want to see my bag for? - Samantha.
it's just some platinum wire. It's worthlike, what, 8 grand?
it's done.
sounds like you invited the Miami-Dade's Sheriff's office -- not exactly what I had in mind.
but it's exactly what you needed.
one day, I'm gonna figure out exactly what game you were playing here.
no game, Brennen.
I'd focus less on me than getting out of the country.
your buyers looked pretty upset with you.
your concern for my welfareis much appreciated.
see you around, Michael.
I love you. Bye.
Charlie says hi.
he wants to know when I'm coming to get him.
you leave town today.
and you need to stay out of town, Sam.
brennen won't forget this.
he doesn't know what to think right now, but if he were ever to confirm that we were working together, well, he wouldn't take it well.
and you need to give up this life.
you got lucky this time.
next time -- - I know. I know.
I just wish my last job didn't feel like such a failure.
you have your life, you have your freedom, and you have Charlie.
you know, Charlie isn't yours.
but he could have been.
a lot of things could have been.
did it go all right?
Yeah, it's over now.
well, it's late. I should go. - Wait.
whatever you're gonna say, it's -- it's in the past.
it is, and it isn't, Fi.
Sam and I worked because she was like me.
she didn't mind that my job was lying to people. She loved it.
she did the same thing.
it made being with her easy.
and then I met you.
and it was... it was different.
it was never easy.
you knew a part of me she never did.
and I left her because...
you don't marry someone when you love somebody else.
you want to play with that somewhere else?
you sure slept in. Late night?
what are you doing?
fixing a camera.
fixing a disposable camera. Right.
I have a meeting to get to.
and if it goes well, you can go home.
you can sleep in your own bed.
you won't have to pretend to sleep in mine.
I'm sorry.
I-I know I shouldn't have been eavesdropping last night.
and honestly, I didn't hear everything, but still, I should
mom, it's all right. I don't give you much choice.
I'm sorry.
you picked the right girl.
I just hope you're not waiting for her to propose, too.
what, the metal detector wasn't enough?
Oh, it's not that I don't trust you. It's just that, uh...
I don't trust you.
okay, here's my "one time, expires immediately" offer
you tell Carla someone else went after her operatives, and we're friends, the kind of friends who don't go bowling, don't go for beers, don't even really speak...
but also don't try to kill each other.
Yeah, I was looking for a little more carrot and a lot less stick.
I have questions, and I think you can answer them.
you're serious? That was your idea?
all life's mysteries revealed in the men's John of the Miami-Dade city hall and municipal building.
actually, yeah, uh, that's what I want exactly.
well, that's not on the menu.
what I'm offering is this -- we're friends on my terms, or we're enemies.
and I'm asking for answers.
spend a career in covert ops, and you learn a lot about yourself.
will you lie to learn something important? Yes.
will you betray someone to serve a higher cause? Maybe.
will you trade another man's life for your freedom?
you don't really know the answer until you face the question.
my name is michael westen. I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing -- no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend... - should we shoot them?
an old friend who used to inform on you to the fbi...
you know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.
family, too...
Hey, is that your mom again?
if you're desperate.
someone needs your help, michael.
bottom line -- until you figure out who burned you, you're not going anywhere.
give us the man who killed our operatives, and you and I can have a little chat about your future.
you didn't tell her it was victor, did you?
the man has tried to kill you twice.
he's the one enemy I know carla has.
I'd like to at least talk to him before I turn him in.
you tell carla someone else went after her operatives, and we're friends.
I have questions, and I have a feeling you can answer them.
well, that's not on the menu.
I'm asking for answers.
the most dangerous time in any operation is just as everything's coming together.
you never know whether you're about to get a pat on the back or a bullet to the back of the head.
of course, there's not much you can do but act like everything's fine.
Hello, michael.
care for a chocolate-covered pomegranate seed?
Khava tea?
you drove all the way out here to offer me a snack? I'm touched.
it's a taste of your former life.
good old days before the burn notice, when michael westen was just a carefree spy in the deserts of afghanistan.
you know, I was like you once, michael. Lived for the job.
eventually, I discovered the job doesn't love you back.
you got burned? - Yes.
I was angry at first.
then I found I didn't miss it.
you might find the same thing, michael.
and if I want my life back?
well... that's why I'm here.
anything's possible if you do your job.
I'm working on it. You know me.
this is serious, michael. Management's not happy.
they'll be in town shortly to make sure everything's resolved.
these are not people to be trifled with, michael, believe me.
I'll do my best, then.
remember, there are worse things than being blacklisted.
Oh, I know. I could be this guy.
Hey, mikey. You sure you weren't followed?
sure as I can be.
unless she's got an invisible helicopter, I think we're fine.
Yeah, I wouldn't put it past her.
she needs to back off if I'm gonna solve her problem.
from what I can tell, she really needs me to solve the problem.
let's see how our guest is doing.
last I checked, he was sleeping.
it's kind of tough to sleep when you're cable-tied to a chair.
how long's he been in there alone?
a few hours. You said not to open the door.
what's in that?
Oh, beanbag rounds.
at this range, it'll break a few ribs.
nice place.
I stayed in a bed and breakfast like this once.
glad you like it.
when you're dealing with a trained operative, you have to assume they're as good as you are.
if you'd have cut through your restraints given a few hours alone, chances are he had the same idea.
that's enough rough-housing, boys.
it's always fun until someone gets hurt.
so, now we're cozy. What shall we talk about?
why don't we start with why you tried to blow me up?
you make it sound so personal.
I was removing operatives from the field. You were cogs in a machine.
I just hit that machine with a baseball bat.
why'd you hit the machine, then?
you know, not to be rude, but I'd just as soon skip to the end here.
the end?
well, if there's one thing everyone knows about michael westen, it's that he wants his job back.
and here I sit, your shot at getting that.
now, it doesn't take an intelligence analyst to see how this ends.
so, wake me when carla gets here, or shoot me now and save everyone some time.
you went after carla's organization. Why?
why does it matter?
nothing I say will change the fact that I'm your ticket out.
why is your curiosity more important than my nap?
you're out of moves here, victor.
your only shot here is to trust me.
hmm, trust you. Just like that.
you have nothing to lose and everything to gain.
I was cia.
my family was stationed with me in mexico city. An op went bad, and...
I lost my wife and son.
the burn notice went out the same day.
I was out on my ass, my family was dead, not even enough money for a bus ticket home.
and then you got a call from carla.
well, I was more enthusiastic about the opportunity than you were.
it was a way back in, a way to get payback.
well, it took me some time, but I found what I was looking for.
and the punch line, the really, really funny part is, it was carla.
she had my family killed as part of my recruitment.
I'm sorry.
by that time, I was inside.
I was an effective operative.
and I figured,"hey, while I'm here, why not gut the entire organization?
well, I took my shot.
and here we are.
Carla doesn't know you're here.
if you're telling the truth, maybe we can work on this together.
I've got a boat docked out at the end of randall key.
the cabin is booby-trapped with a claymore.
check under the bed.
if you want proof, that's the best I can do.
you're trusting him?
how many times does someone have to try to kill you before he's crossed the line?
we came to an understanding.
you know, when I was a kid, I adopted a dog that I found.
he had these big eyes, and I used to rub his belly, and I thought we had something special
right up until he bit a chunk out of me.
I'll show you the scar if you'd like.
I'll be careful, sam. - I'm coming with you.
give him some air. See what else you can get out of him.
rub his belly if you need to.
nice work.
Victor should probably teacha class or something.
clear.
he said to checkunder the bed.
spam and cap'n crunch.
no wonder he's so erratic.
spies are supposed toravel light with nothing that could identify them.
some do, but most find that staying sane requires staying connected to something that reminds them why they do what they do.
pictures are particularly dangerous to carry, unless the people in them are already dead.
Michael, his little boywas only 4.
who knew you couldfeel this bad for a psychopathon the edge of sanity?
people don't get thereon their own, fi.
being under carla's thumb, it's a strain.
well, you've doneall right.
I never lost everyoneI cared about.
you and I need to havea little chat, 'cause you've gota long way to go before I believeall this business.
is this an interrogation?
no. That's suchan ugly word.
I just want you to show me that you arewho you say you are.
establish your identity.
that's, what, number five in the militaryinterrogation manual?
look, we don't have to playany games here.
the fact is, we're bothon the same side, right?
fear down. "Approach 14, right?
Yeah. I believeit is number 14. So how about this?
technique number one --the direct approach.
my best friend, mike, is out there putting his butt on the line for you, soI want some answers.
now, the folksthat you work for
is this a government agency, a foreign power?
what are we up against?
well, they never gave me a peekat the employee handbook.
all I knowis they run black ops.
could be multinational. Could be work for hire.
they break jobs into piecesso no one gets the big picture.
well, that's not a good sign. Why miami?
they're in cities all over.
although fromwhat I can tell, they may have to shut downin miami for a while.
well, I don't likethe sound of that. - You shouldn'T.
if michael doesn't hand me over, carla's gonna cut her losses, starting withmichael's family.
she's gonna bea busy girl.
what's wrong?
well, I've been talkingto our unstable friend.
this doesn'tsound good, mike.
I mean, the big boysare coming into town, and if we don'thand him over...
no, we're not handinganyone over.
I'm just saying, we could have a waron our hands.
let me cancelmy meeting. - No, don'T.
we need to keepeverything looking likebusiness as usual.
Sam, can you pick up my mom? Take her up to orlando.
make it look like a day trip.
I don't want her in townif anything starts happening.
I'm on it.
you sure you don'twant me to -- - no, fi, go. I'll be all right.
stretch those arms out. Get up. That's it. Stretch way out, way out. More.
what a great exercise it is for your shoulders and your arms, to help you when you wear those sleeveless dresses, you gals, to really help you look like you should look.
and you guys out there, I want you to look like a man's supposed to look.
Sam! You scared me.
sorry. Listen, madeline, I hate to do this to you again, but, uh, we gota situation.
why, what's wrong? Is michael okay?
he's fine. But is your stuff handy?
cause it's time for anemergency trip to disney world.
disney world?
why in god's name would I wantto go to disney world?
because it'sa magical kingdom with lots of witnessesand great security.
so if you could just getyour bag, we'll go.
no. I'm not runningfor michael anymore!
and I think it's time that all of you stoppedtreating me like a baby and told mewhat's going on.
uh, that's a long story.
wonderful. I love stories.
Yeah, but, see, it's the kind of story that's best toldon the way up to orlando.
do you know they have a hotelup there where the giraffes, they come right upto your balcony?
well, as muchas I love giraffes...
I'm not uprooting my life againto run from something
I don't even knowwhat it's about, sam!
so I'm not goinganywhere...
till I get some answers.
uh, oof, well, it's -- it's complicated.
uh, oof, well, the sooner you explain, the sooner we'll be offto cinderella's castle.
Victor, I sympathizewith your situation.
but it's a little hardto trust someone when they've triedto kill you four times.
four? That seems high.
Oh, come on, you're countingearlier with the chair. - Yes.
listen, sport, relax.
this will all be over shortlyfor you and for me.
well, you told carla to back offso you could find me, yes?
of course you did.
they'll still run surveillance, though, and check in. What time is it -- 10: 30 or so?
about that.
I've been off the grid long enough for themto get suspicious.
they'll have gottenthe go-ahead to hunt you, set up a perimeter aroundyour last known location.
if there's a major roadaround here
they'll be waiting at it. Wonderful!
look at it this way --when carla finds out you hid me, all your questionswill be resolved...
with a bullet to the headfor both of us.
Oh, you're gonnakill me yourself.
well, hell, yeah, if you'regonna step to the bell, you might as wellring it, huh?
let's get out of here.
wait, wait, you're gonna help me?
lucky you.
Oh, looks like they were closerthan I thought.
probably just waitingto see our pretty faces before they moved in.
you drive.
you don't last long as a spy if you don't trust anyone.
if you're looking over your shoulder to see who's coming after you, you can't see where you're going.
sometimes you just have to trust your gut.
these guys are pretty good.
looks like they pulled out all the stops for us.
I'm flattered.
in a firefight on the road, you've got a few options.
without something high-caliber, you're not going to be able to penetrate the radiator or the firewall behind it.
that leaves two options
the windshield or ricocheting bullets off the ground up through the undercarriage, which is one of the least-reinforced parts of the car.
for sheer panic, it's hard to beat bullets coming up from the floorboards.
is that brake fluid?
polyethylene glycol's not gonna burn fastenough to do anything.
it will when it's mixedwith chlorine dioxide and some other stuff.
someone's been tothe chemical store, I see.
I like you. Have I ever told you that?
here comes another one. We got to get out of here.
we're gonna need to finda parking garage.
we need a new ride.
Carla, not a good time!
you think you're clever. - Clever?
well, I tested wellin school, but they saythat doesn't mean
you're trying to save the manwho tried to kill you.
Victor and I have knowneach other for a long time.
you have no ideawho you're dealing with.
you know, I knowit's been a short time, but sometimes you meet someone, and you just get that feeling.
enough. It's time you learnedactions have consequences.
she give you the "actions have consequences" speech?
Yeah.
as someonewho's doled out a lot of those consequencesover the years, she'll go afteryour family.
that'll be harderthan she thinks.
here. There.
how about this? Two guys, miami, cute convertible. Perfect camouflage.
Yeah, I'm looking for something with a littlemore horsepower.
here comes a second car. This should get interesting.
Madeline, if I knew more, I would tell you.
so you don't knowwho these people are? I mean, you have names.
can't you just look them up?
that's not how it works.
if somebody's doing somethingoff the books, they don't hand outdecoder rings and builda mountain fortress.
so it's carla and victor.
and michael's in troublewith them.
so what does ithave to do with me?
it's all a wayto get to mike. You're somebodyhe cares about. It's leverage.
please, I'm not leverage. You want a beer?
no, madeline! I don't want a beer.
okay. This is serious.
that's whatI'm trying to say.
I'll get my stuff.
crap.
change of plans. Where's your shotgun?
in the back. - Go get it, now.
what the hellare you doing? - Get down.
I guess this means we're notgoing to disney world.
they're not taking any chances with thetwo bad boys in here.
they're doing it right, setting up a perimeterand waiting for backup.
well, we should getsome backup of our own.
careful with that phone. Chances are, it's a party line now.
pleasure doing businesswith you. Say hi to paco.
Bonjour. - Fi.
Michael, you are not gonnabelieve the deal I got today.
I am better at buying gunsthan I am at buying shoes, and I am really goodat buying shoes.
Fiona glenanne. - What?
remember that drive pastthe factory where we first met?
do you think we could dosomething similar where we, uh, picnickedlast month?
you'll be makingthis drive soon?
as fast as I can manage.
they're setting upa spike strip.
Oh, this is gettingbetter and better.
I'm not getting michaelor fiona.
they probably ditchedthe phones.
should I call the police? - No.
that'll make it waytoo easy for them.
cops take us to the station, they know where we are, and they knowthat we are unarmed.
so what do we do? Just sit here and wait?
no, they're gonnaget more guys.
we got to create a distractionand get them out of here.
but the thing is, they're all over my car, and there's no way to getyour car out of the garage.
we could borrowmrs. Reynolds' car.
she lives overthe back fence, and i have the keyin case of emergency.
back fence, huh? That could work.
Madeline, think you could findsome christmas lights?
when you're outmanned and outgunned, the key is to appear bigger and stronger than you are.
take your enemy's expectations and turn them against him.
to make a good-sized fireball without a lot of ordnance, you need a powder with a high surface-area-to-mass ratio.
non-dairy creamer mixed with gunpowder works nicely.
I could probably put twoor three of them down, get one of their gunson the way out.
we're trying to keepthe body count a little bit lowerthan that.
this isn't just about gettingout of a parking garage. We might have a shotright now.
I've worked with carlafor a long time now.
insurance? - Yeah, she likes her ops teamsfor personal errands.
making extra cash, payback, that kind of thing.
now, I've got a fileat a safe house in town. Now, we get that...
we can blackmail our wayto safety.
Yeah, it'sa distant second to dousing her in keroseneand lighting a match, but under the circumstances, it'll have to do.
now, are we ready to use thisor what?
I think we can get furtherwith this. Let's go.
a security perimeter is like a defensive line in football.
you've got a couple of options.
you can try to punch through the line with brute force...
or you can soften it up with a little misdirection.
here they come.
look out.
get out of the way!
I'm liking your planless and less.
everything's fine, as longas we keep them behind us.
fine? - Relatively fine.
come on, michael.
where did you meet her?
blackmail. That's the idea?
we're doing all this so we can throw somepaperwork at carla?
it's the smart play here. We're outgunned.
we'll get bigger guns.
I can't believewhat I'm hearing.
I saw what she did to youand your family.
if the file is so great, then why didn't youuse it before?
this isn't just about her.
I want the guyswho call the shots.
the file was just in case, enough to force her to back off.
if this was just about puttinga bullet in carla, it would have been overa long time ago.
still, putting a bullet in carlasounds awfully good.
if it comes to that, you'll have to get in line.
Yeah, about that file?
your safe house --not so safe.
she's good. I was three deepwith fake safe houses trying to keep this placefrom her.
sometimes I wishshe'd get a hobby.
which room is it in?
it's not in a room. It's on the utility pole.
a fake utility box isn't a bad hiding place.
Oh, nice.
people don't touch things labeled "high voltage.
repair crews leave them alone, too.
they're not real, so they never need servicing.
too bad carla'ssurveillance is parked rightin front of it.
two cars, four guys. Think we can handle it.
we each shoot oneand rochambeau for the other.
Yeah, we don't knowit's carla's guys.
it could be atf, fbiworking off of bad intel.
they could becompletely innocent.
Oh, please. No one's completely innocent.
is that what you told yourselfwhen you tried to kill me?
let's go.
thanks for calling onstar.
Yes, I need directionsto the closest hardware store.
I'd like to avoidmajor intersections and government buildings.
I found a hardware store on siebert avenue. Would you like me to direct you?
Yes, please.
okay. The party's starting.
you ready? - Does it matter?
not really.
do you think they saw us?
no, they're busywith the team out front. We're probably good to go.
if I knewthat baby was here, I would have gotten usout of there a lot faster.
turn this way? - Right down here.
Why? Is it a shortcutwhere we're going?
I'm telling you, I think the idea sucks. Just pull over in here.
what, where? Right here? - Now. Yes.
why are we pulling over here? - Don't ask questions. Just do it, please.
Madeline, you saw what happenedback there, right?
Yeah, I did.
you really think the best useof your time is a three-hour driveto orlando?
Yeah. Do you have a better idea? - Yeah, I do.
okay, fine. Well, let's hear your plan.
I take care of myself, and you go save my son!
they sent men to mewith guns, sam.
God knows whatthey sent to him.
listen, the one thing a woman my age can doin miami is blend in.
if they can pick me out of10, 000 other 60-something women with bleached-blond hair,
I guess I'm done for, huh?
can you find him?
maybe. We got a few rally pointsaround miami we use for emergencies.
but come on, madeline. Are you sure?
he needs youmore than I do, sam. Just go, please.
Bye, sam.
Mike's gonna kill me.
one of the most common cover I. D. S for a spy is service personnel.
of course, anyone who works in intelligence knows to check service personnel.
so a quick phone call to the gas company, and you've created the perfect distraction.
the active ingredient in pepper spray is the chemical capsaicin.
mix the birdseed with some alcohol and oil, pressurize it in a paint sprayer with co2, and you have a homemade pepper grenade.
a few nails in the right places on a car door blocks the lever bar, making it impossible to open, and leaving you free to do pretty much whatever you want.
I could see why carlawouldn't want this out there.
she'd send a black-ops teamto deal with a parking ticket.
pretty much.
the higher-ups stay awayfrom most operations.
they have two rules -- don'tscrew up, and don't get caught.
they don't get involved unlessthings go very, very wrong.
well, I'd saythis situation qualifies.
Carla has a lot of enemiesfrom her spook days, and she's made more since.
and then she made the mistakeof vouching for you, big guy.
those files should bemore than enough to earn hera retirement bullet.
Carla's entire work history --this is pretty damning stuff.
you think you can playthis card?
when we get backto my boat, I've got the codes andcomm lines to go above her head.
if she knows I can getto them with this, then she'llback off -- fast.
then we get out of town, maybe to cuba.
fabulous. Great music, lots of sexy unemployed men.
Fi, can I talk to youfor a sec?
I'm not invited to cuba.
they're gonna follow uswith everything they have.
I need you to find samand help him protect my family.
can't sam do iton his own?
I know you don't liketo hear this, but you and samare a good team.
and do you think I... - the car.
I expect you to bring it backclean with a full tank. Capisce?
I can do that.
it's not goodbye. It's just... in case.
and that is to remind youto be careful.
looks like no one's around.
we'll scout the perimeter. If it's clear, we'll go in.
all this time, you neverfound out who burned you?
who cares? Name in a file.
behind that, another name.
you know howthese things start. Someone runs an operationoff the books.
it's supposed to bea one-time thing, but when it's over, there's power to be had.
takes on a life of its own.
it's the organization, not some guy.
why me?
don't tell me my namewas picked out of some hat.
it was no secretyou were good at your job.
the machine wanted you, so it took you.
now you're part of it. And I'm part of it.
but that's what we're tryingto destroy here, sport.
Ah, there you are.
I haven't been able to getanybody on the phone for ages.
Where's mikey? Is he here?
no. He decided to go on a tripto cuba with victor.
they're going after carlawith documents.
what are wesupposed to do?
I promised him I'd help youprotect the family.
well, I promised madelineI'd help protect mike.
so I guessthe question is...
which promise do we keep?
looks like we're all clear.
we have enough fuelto make it to the island, as long as we don't have to dotoo much detouring on the way.
you start the engines. I'll cast off.
bad day fora cruise, michael.
a very, very bad day.
you think so?
and here I was hopingyou came to see us off.
I took the precaution of havingthe local marinas searched when I lost contactwith victor.
seemed like a long shot.
hated to thinkmy two favorite operatives might be making nastylittle plans together.
sorry to disappoint you.
well, not to spoil the fun, but the boat's wired with c-4.
can't have you leavingbefore we have a chat.
great. Come on board. Let's talk.
I'm fine here, thanks.
Michael, management's on the way.
they're gonna want to knowwhat happened here.
any story I tell themhas to begin with victor's dead body.
afraid of what he might shareabout your history together?
not important. What's important is thatthis story needs a hero.
it could be you.
kill him or send him out, and I'll do it.
if you leave me no alternative, there's always the c-4.
you want to explain blowing upyour entire team?
doesn't speak wellfor your management skills.
Yeah, well, I'd haveto explain two dead bodies. You'd have to beone of them.
just end this, michael! He's a killer. You know that.
he's what you made him. - Time is up, michael!
finish it off, or I will finish it for you!
finally.
look, I know you wantto savor the moment, but we got to getout of here.
looks like whoever's in thatchopper brought some backup.
standing by for clearance. Secure your perimeter.
move it.
they're heading into the trees.
clear for touchdown.
we got to talk, big guy.
you have to get out there and get on top of thisbefore her body cools.
take the file. Tell them when you found me, I turned on carla.
you lured her here, had your team take her out, and then killed me.
killed you?
it's over.
the only question is...
whether you're a traitorwho helped me or the ace operativewho shot me.
help me out.
I'm dead one wayor the other.
they get me alive, and they're gonna take me apart.
you know it hasto be like this.
it was good playingwith you, sport.
now you get out.
get out while you can.
Hey, there! Took you guys long enough.
put down the gun.
want to get thoseout of my face?
could have usedyou guys earlier.
no, this is for the big guy.
good luck, mike.
in intelligence work, your most important tool
more important than any combat technique, any technical skill
is your ability to twist the facts of a situation to your own advantage.
the worse the facts are, the more you've got to sell it.
well...
two rogue operativesin one day? Lucky us.
you're welcome. You know, I think you needto talk to the folks in human resources.
you have some staff issues.
I agree completely.
tell me, michael, since you knowso much about our problems, what should I do about ournew recruit, michael westen?
wonderfully effective, terrifically resourceful, truly the best I've ever seen, but he just doesn't seem happy.
maybe it's the threatsagainst his family.
maybe it's the peopletrying to kill him.
maybe it's the factthat he had to use his people to clean up your mess.
your operatives -- - are dead. And you're not.
you've createda job opening, michael.
and I have to fill it.
want money? We can do that.
you want to get outof miami?
I want you peopleout of my life!
out of your life?
tell me, michael. All your old enemiesfrom your spy days, all the people who have scoresto settle with michael westen
where do you thinkthey've been?
did they justforget about you?
or has someone beenkeeping them at bay?
you think you've beenunder our thumb?
you've beenunder our protection. Think about that.
Yeah, I'll be fine, thanks.
you really think so? - Yeah.
tell you what.
we'll leave you aloneif that's what you want. Your family, too.
see how you like it.
you want out?
there's the door.
but hear this
you have no ideawhat hell will rain down if we stop watching outfor you.
I'll take my chances.
as a spy working for a government, you're protected.
you may work solo, but you have agreements with other spy agencies.
even when you're surrounded by your enemies, that protects you.
when your entire career consists of making enemies, there's no greater danger than being totally cut off, alone.
when you find yourself out in the cold, all you can do is put your head down and try to survive.
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing -- no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend... - should we shoot them?
an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.
family, too...
Hey, is that your mom again?
if you're desperate.
someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line -- as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
in any operation, whether it's sneaking into an embassy or collecting debts for a bookie, it's important to lay out a plan before you go into action.
if you're going to disagree, it's best to get it out of the way before any shots are fired.
I'm going to ask this guy one more time, politely, for my client's money back.
if he doesn't pay...
we shove him into a trunk at gunpoint?
do you have a better way to make 5 grand?
the guy is a charmless sleazebag. No one's getting hurt. Perfect job.
the perfect job, Fi? Seriously?
we can use the cash, Michael.
we're setting up a nice little business here. We ought to do it right.
I've got my eye on a new ankle holster.
God knows the charger could use some air-conditioning.
actually, I was hoping to use my share to get in touch with some old intelligence contacts.
Oh, bribing people to get your old job back.
honestly, Michael, I'd rather you spent it on drugs.
why don't we compromise?
I'll buy you dinner tonight, someplace nice.
fine. It's a date.
give me exactly three minutes.
if I'm not out, you come on in with the shotgun.
there's a breaching round for the door and rock salt for the sleazebag and his friends.
wish me luck.
for many operations, two-man teams are ideal.
simple chain of command, easy to delegate responsibility, and little room for confusion.
does randall know you're coming?
Oh, I want it to be a surprise.
of course, with a two-man team, there's not a lot of margin for error.
all it takes is a cop showing up at the wrong moment, and the team ceases to exist.
detective paxson, good to see you.
Mr. Westen. You're a tough one to track down. You have a moment?
another time would be better.
what the hell are you doing here?
I'm asking politely one last time for my client's 20 grand.
I told you, I ain't got it. And I'm not paying.
tell scotty if he wants it he can come here and get it himself.
you look preoccupied.
I'm just picking up a friend from a poker game.
she consumed an alcoholic beverage.
I volunteered to be her designated driver.
you know, I should give her a call.
Oh, don't -- don't rush on my account.
I'm not going back to my client empty-handed.
if I can't deliver the money, then I'll deliver you.
you will, huh? You gonna carry me out yourself?
no. I'll have a little help.
were you expecting someone?
she may have consumed two alcoholic beverages.
everything okay here? - Absolutely. Why?
great party! I'll see you later!
I'm sure you can explain this, but frankly, I've had enough of your explanations, so that's why I brought you some babysitters.
a police tail. Lucky us.
and for your friend.
so, I answer your questions, or you get us killed. Is that the idea?
no. You answer my questions before you get yourselves killed.
looks like we have a chaperone on our date tonight.
I distinctly recall you saying "someplace nice."
we're at the Carlito. We eat half of our meals here.
have you forgotten what a date is?
I said that when I thought we were gonna be 5 grand richer.
would you like anything else? - Yes.
your most expensive desert, please.
look at the bright side, Fi -- you weren't killed.
Oh, please, if a loser like Randall can kill me, then I deserve it.
well... You two look as good as I feel.
you invited him?
I need an invite to Carlito's now?
I'm being audited. Fun, fun, fun.
is that courtesy of detective Paxson?
no, it's been building up for a while.
something about deducting mojitos.
Hey, speaking of Paxson, is this gonna be, like, a 24-hour-a-day-type deal?
for now. And with our lifestyle, one of Paxson's surprise visits could get someone killed.
Yeah, I know. I've been trying to come up with something on her.
problem is she's a good cop. She's too clean to blackmail.
we got to come up with a whole new angle here.
okay, wait a second. Is -- is this a date?
Yes. - No.
this is officially not a date.
all righty. Can you bring us another spoon?
you're not gonna eat that cherry, are you?
when you're being followed by the police, it's important to remember that having cops around is a problem for criminals.
but it's an even bigger problem for a detective trying to remain inconspicuous on a stakeout.
waiting for a friend?
I'm on police business. You need to get out of here now.
I'm police business, aren't I?
apparently, I'm important enough to have a 24-hour tail.
this is a bad time. - Are you on a stakeout?
are you waiting for someone to come home?
do you need help with your cover I. D?
I could be a fellow coffee lover, a boyfriend, anything you need.
I'm working another case here, a case I've spent eight months trying to crack.
people are dying, Mr. Westen.
I don't have time for these games.
neither do I, detective. I'm telling you, we're on the same side.
I'll determine what side you're on.
you say we're on the same side? Prove it to me.
you know, maybe you do need some proof. You're right. We should talk later.
Sam, I think I found a new angle.
I need you to find out a little more about another case Paxson's working on.
cookies.
after your birthday cake, I-I decided I'd take up cooking.
it's supposed to be relaxing. So far, I'm not convinced.
uh, let me know how that goes.
Hey, mom, if the cops out front ask, tell them I've run to the store.
you know, Michael, I'd appreciate it if when you stopped by, it wasn't only to lose your police tail.
mom, please. I'm supposed to meet Sam.
fine. Pick me up some eggs.
and some cigarettes!
Hey, Mikey, what's up with the new car?
300 bucks. Statistically, it's the second-most popular car in Miami.
it should make tailing me a little more challenging.
so, turns out there was a harassment complaint filed against Paxson a month ago.
so you're not the only guy she's pursuing night and day.
and I thought I was special.
guy's name is Matheson.
has a habit of ripping off drug dealers.
left a trail of bodies across Miami.
the guy they're putting in the ground right there -- he was a neighbor at one of the heists...
caught in the crossfire.
does she have a case against matheson?
no. He covers his tracks like a pro.
see, Paxson took a bunch of swings at him and missed, so he filed the harassment suit.
D. A.made her back off, so he doesn't even have to hide anymore.
do we know where he's not hiding?
we do.
I think it's time Paxson got a little help with her case.
we take Matheson down the right way, she'll have no choice but to get off my back.
I don't think she wants our help.
well, she's getting it.
he deserves some jail time, and she deserves a break.
right, well, you enjoy your new wheels. I got to get to my audit.
you gonna be all right?
Oh, yeah. I think so.
the irs agent's name is Stacey Conolly.
time to deploy the sam axe arsenal.
in any sort of operation, flirtation is always a tactical option.
romance is a powerful force, and under the right circumstances, it can achieve your objective.
of course, not every circumstance is the right one.
good afternoon, Mr. Axe.
Stacey Conolly. Irs.
now, this is a rather unfortunate place for an audit meeting.
we have a lot of work to get through, Mr. Axe, and the, uh, calypso music is a distraction we do not need.
two cosmos.
I assume the pink beverages are an attempt to get me drunk.
well, it's not gonna work because I do not drink, Mr. Axe.
I audit. - Right.
uh, uh, no, actually, these are, uh, these are for me.
I see. Well, you'll need them.
I, uh, pulled your file. It's not pretty. It's not pretty at all.
now, this is to inform you that your pension checks are being held.
they'll be released once we reconcile every penny you've spent over the last three years.
now, I assume you brought your records.
um, no, I just thought we would get acquainted.
this is not a good start. This is not a good start at all.
my office will contact you with a new appointment.
remember, Mr. Axe, the irs can't be charmed with a fancy shirt, smooth talk, and pink drinks.
the irs demands the truth, okay? Good day.
Michael, this Matheson creep rips off drug dealers for a living.
you sure this is the easiest way to get Paxson off your back?
the easiest way to get her off my back is to answer her questions.
this way, it doesn't involve me going to jail.
finding a way into a criminal organization is about observing social dynamics.
you start with the target.
I'm like, "good luck."
Hey, what are you doing? I'm in the middle of a story.
just leave my drink alone until I'm done talking, okay?
he seems lovely. - Watch your step, kid.
you're looking for just the right person to approach.
people in the inner circle are usually too tough to go after.
anyone with real power is bound to be cautious.
drivers and bodyguards are easier, but they usually don't have real access.
you want someone with enough juice to be hungry for more, someone desperate to make a move.
in short, you're looking for a frustrated middle manager.
what did I say, Tommy?
how many times I got to tell you?
no business talk here. None.
see, that's your problem, Tommy -- you don't think.
sorry. - Yeah, all right. You're sorry. Now get out of here.
I think I found our guy.
good, 'cause we need to leave. Hear those sirens? Those are for us.
Sam called. Detective Paxson found my car on 6th.
she's going to start searching the area.
if Mr. Personality here sees you with Paxson...
it'll be almost as bad as Paxson seeing us with him. Let's go.
Hey, detective. Always a pleasure.
I see you left your police escort back at your mother's house.
Oh, I knew I forgot something.
let me be clear, Mr. Westen.
every time you ditch your escort, you dig yourself a deeper hole.
I'm taking you down. It's just a matter of time.
hold still, mike.
to the educated eye, a prison tattoo tells a story.
where you did time, why you did time, and who you did it with.
leave you two alone for a minute...
I'm just giving Mike his, uh, prison ink, Fi.
I think I might havea second career here.
Sam checked outthat guy Tommy, the one Mathesonwas smacking around.
Yeah, Tommy Dantonio. He's pretty small-time.
some counterfeit concert tickets, some b&e, did two years in Allendale for armed robbery.
now he's pretty much a fixture at the dog track when he's not hanging around with Matheson.
you think this guy's gonna get us onto Matheson's crew?
he's the best we got. - Okay. There you go. That'll do it.
I should charge you for those bricks. That's art, man.
beautiful, Sam.
I got to take the "over the roof and down the rain gutter" exit.
mind keeping them busy for me?
sure thing, Mikey.
every kid who ever went to a new school knows the secret to fitting in -- copy everyone else.
spies do the same thing -- tailor their wardrobe, their movement, and their behavior to imitate their targets.
all the little things that say "I'm your kind of guy."
Ah, the freaking dogs.
looks like you got my kind of luck.
I should just throw my money on the ground, save myself some time.
eh, I got some good picks coming up.
you got some picks? - Yeah.
Yeah, I need them.
you're, uh, you're Tommy Dantonio, right?
who's asking?
my name's Milo. I got some friends.
they told me if I ever come down to, uh, Miami, you're the guy to talk to.
I heard you like the dogs.
these friends of yours, they, uh, from Allendale?
Yeah, bingo. I did a nickel for grand theft. Got out last year.
Oh, yeah? I got out right before you went in.
so, uh, those guys up there, they talk about me a lot?
are you kidding me? Yeah.
they all got mad respect for you.
so I thought, when I come down to Miami, if I could just meet Tommy Dantonio, maybe I could learn a few things, you know?
what are you doing in Miami?
I'm trying to earn. That's what I'm doing.
I brought my girl down here.
as soon as I get in Miami, as soon as she's here, I can't keep a buck in my pocket.
you know women. - Yeah, I know women.
Hey, Mr. Dantonio, do you think...
call me Tommy.
Really? - Yeah.
all -- all right.
I just --I'm just looking to be pointed in the right direction, you know?
I mean, I got my crew, you know? - Yeah?
you got a crew? - Yeah.
me too. - It's a small crew.
it's just me, my buddy, and my girl. It's not big time like you.
we're tight, but we don't make a lot. Thanks.
you know, we make a grand here, 2 grand there, but it adds up.
Yeah, sure.
so, uh, listen, why don't you, uh, bring them around tonight?
maybe we could have a little dinner, show you and your crew the ropes a little.
Mr. Dantonio, that would -- Tommy.
that -- that would be incredible. You sure?
sure, I'm sure. You like seafood?
that's another $383 in deductions for "business drinks."
can I ask what business you were doing?
I told you --it's classified.
the irs does not allow classified deductions, Mr. Axe.
I'm disallowing this until the operation is made public.
and then... there's this.
well, you wanted documentation of my trip to the middle east.
that's it. That's all I got.
got it off this guy who was in this group we were targeting.
Oh, so, you stole it.
no, I didn't steal it. The guy, um... he was done with it.
so, it was a gift. - It's not a gift.
there was this thing, and then the gun didn't have an owner anymore.
I'm just gonna mark that down as a windfall... income.
okay, with those disallowed deductions, you have a tax deficiency of 17%.
over 25%, the statute of limitations on your audit is extended another three years, so we could be spendinga lot of time in your friend's sunroom.
fresh-baked chocolate-chip cookies?
no. I'm allergic to chocolate. And to wheat flour. And to eggs.
I'll take one, Maddy. Thanks.
okay, so, for tomorrow, I'm gonna need you to estimate the value of meals, rent, and transportation provided to you by your, uh, "lady friends,"
as you call them, over the last three years. By financial quarter, please.
I'll let myself out.
take care.
I have a headache in my eye.
you want another cookie? - I'm good.
for a spy, knowing how to follow is at least as important as knowing how to lead.
sensitive operations often depend on knowing how hard to laugh at the boss's jokes.
I got four more where those came from.
Hey, what'd I tell you? What'd I tell you about this guy, huh?
he can hook us up, right? Look at this.
Yeah, Milo here couldn't get a table this good at Burger King, huh?
Hey, you just got to know how it works. We should order, all right? Okay?
it's on me, so, uh, whatever you like, except the lobster.
Ugh, lobster? They look like bugs.
come on, Brianna. Show some respect. Don't talk about bugs and stuff here.
Milo, just some people are not too comfortable in nice places.
order what you like, sweetheart.
so, Milo says you're the guy to talk to in Miami about looking for work.
it could be, if you, uh, know how to use your head.
we hit a few car dealers up north, you know?
I'd act like I was taking a car for a test drive. You know, I'd grab the keys.
Brianna would strut her stuff, you know, keep them busy.
then chuck here, he'd step in if things got rough.
and the dealerships -- they got wise, so it was too hot.
now we're dying down here.
see, that's your problem. You don't think big.
last month, I hit a check- cashing place in Boca.
walked away with 3 grand. Bam!
3, 000 bucks. Man, that's a hell of a score, huh?
and the one that got me pinched was a credit union, basically a bank.
nearly walked away with 40 large.
now, that's the big leagues.
I don't mean to be out of line, but I was thinking that maybe we could come on to one of those jobs, you know, make some real money.
we'll see what happens tonight.
we're gonna do a little job, see how you do.
I just smoke one a day since I got out of the joint.
it's called willpower. You want one?
uh, no. No, thanks. Uh, where we headed?
dry cleaner's up there. We're hitting it.
I got the whole score worked out, like clockwork.
the register's got everything from the weekend in it.
only one guy working the counter.
big chuck over here throws a few rocks at the place, gets the guy to come out.
Oh, you mean like, uh, like a distraction?
exactly. Right. Then the little lady runs over...
spray-paints the security camera by the door.
Aww, red is my favoritecolor, Tommy.
good. That's good.
then me and Milo run in, grab the cash, and run out the back.
like clock work.
wait, just so I can be sure about this.
she kills the camera with the spray paint or did you want her to cut the cable on the roof?
you see? He's learning.
she should cut the cable on the roof.
you're the boss, Tommy. - That's right. I am the boss.
is -- is that... w-- you gonna shoot somebody?
no, no. It's not loaded. It's just to scare the guy in case, you know...
you just point it at him like that.
that's how they do it now.
no, not that way. More like that. There you go. That's good.
you ready? - Yeah.
show me what you got.
Hey, who's there?
come on, hey! I'm calling the cops!
Ah, it's stuck!
I'm calling the cops! Get out of there!
the lock on a cash-register drawer is designed to keep it from pulling open.
whack it hard enough the other way, and it breaks.
Tommy. - Yeah?
aren't we supposed to go out the back? - Yeah, right.
Oh, Christ, there's a pad lock on the back door for
we're gonna get pinched over here. We're gonna get pinched. We're
you're saying unless we break the lock, right?
Yeah. We got to break the lock.
when a pad lock's held onto a door frame by three-inch wood screws, it's no match for a dry-cleaning rack that can move 30, 000 pounds of clothes.
not bad, kid.
I boosted a new ride. You get the cash?
clockwork, like Tommy said. - You did good.
detective Paxson.
Mr. Westen.
how's the investigation going?
pretty well, actually.
it's amazing what a crime lab can do these days.
they can trace wire, solder, duct tape and link it to various devices found at crime scenes.
Oh, so, this isan "I'm onto you" visit. Great.
there's more. There was an incident last night at 17th avenue.
a dry cleaner was robbed, an impala was stolen, and the lead thief managed to keep his face hidden the entire time.
I thought of you.
well, I am so glad that I am on your mind.
but can we cut to the chase? Are you arresting me?
not yet.
I'm just giving youa chance to explain yourself before the lab work gets done.
pass, but thanks.
well, if you change your mind, you'll always have a couple officers in the car behind you.
see you soon, Mr. Westen.
she's shot gunning it, trying to tie meto anything on her database.
Yeah, and I'll bet she's asking for an electronic-surveillance warrant for this place asap.
she's good. You got to give her that.
Fi, did you ditch the impalafrom last night?
Yeah, it's in a boat house on the river. The cops won't find it for months.
so, after giving the dry cleaner back all his money, last night's he is cost us a grand.
Hey, that's the least of our worries.
Mike, once that stuff comes back from the crime lab, you are on the run.
we need to wrap this up. We need to get to Matheson.
it's time for Tommy's crew to run into some cash-flow problems.
looking good.
the sight of a fresh injury has a primal effect on people.
if you really need to make a point, sometimes, there's no substitute for a good shiner.
it's never fun, but if that's what sells your story, it's worth a little pain.
all right. Good luck, buddy.
Hey, Milo. What happened?
Yeah, I'm all right, I'm all right. Sorry, but, uh... I got to leave town.
what are you talking about? - There's these guys up north.
uh, I owe them some money, and they, uh, they found me, and, uh, anyway, the point is, I got to earn.
and listen, you've been great, but, uh, ripping off dry cleaners is just not gonna do it for us.
listen to me, I-I knowwe're just getting started and you were a little nervous last night, but you did real good, man.
Hey, coming from you, that means so much to me.
but, uh I need a real score, and I need it real soon, so...
Milo, Milo, Milo. Listen to me.
you know the worst odds I ever saw on a dog? 200 to 1.
he was so excited, raring to go. I put a c-note down.
figure if he wins, I got a new car. - He win?
busted his leg out of the shoot.
they were gonna put him down, so I took him, a perfectly good dog. Got gimpy leg.
he's not a new car, but the point is, you got to wait for the door to open before you can run.
working with you has been like a dream come true, but unless I make some real money, they're gonna break my leglike that dog in your story. I'm sorry.
Hey, wait, Milo. I might got something for you.
meet me over at Jimmy's with the guys later.
I want to introduce you to an associate of mine -- Rick Matheson.
what -- he work for you or something?
no, no, w-we work together... uh, on the big jobs, of course.
so you dress nice.
Yeah, I'll be there.
care to explain why you deducted a $452 his-and-hers spa weekend?
I was conducting business.
business, as defined by tax law, does not involve the application of "cucumber lotion."
disallowed.
your tax deficiency is nearing 25%, Mr. Axe.
now, one more suspect deduction, and we're gonna...
we're gonna have to, uh...
wait a minute. I know you.
your mom's Josie Conolly. I dated her back in the day.
we used to play catch.
you were the little boy with the girl name.
okay, look, there are a lot of men named Stacey through history.
Stacey Andrews -- male offensive tackle for the philadelphia eagles.
Stacey Roest -- male hockey player for the detroit red wings.
TV's Stacy Keachwas a wonderful male actor.
I think he's best known for -- you know what? Let's just focus on business now.
do you remember the one time I bought you a pack of baseball cards?
I have no idea what you're referring to, Mr. Axe.
you have to remember. You had a bike. It was a Schwinn. I got some tape.
okay, you must be recalling some other child acquaintance.
no, we took the cards, put them in the spokes of your wheel, and when you rode around in it,
it sounded like a motorcycle. You'd call me Evel Knievel.
you acted like you liked me.
and then one day, you disappeared, and you never came back.
Oh, no, no. It wasn't like that.
I thought you were a good kid.
when your ma broke things off, I called a couple times, tried to take you to a game or something, but she, uh, she didn't want to have anything to do with me.
you know how it goes.
I think I have everything I need for my audit.
Stacey, wait a second. L-l-let's grab a beer and catch up.
or -- or no beer. We'll -- we'll just...
you dated Stacey's mother?
just for a bit.
looks like it was long enough to make an impression.
Yeah. I guess so.
it's a challenge to place a bug on someone's body without them noticing.
it helps if they always carry something you can reproduce.
a phone, a watch, or a pack of cigarettes.
then it's just a matter of planting it on them and hoping they keep ignoring the surgeon general until you get what you need.
Mike, this is a dicey time to be doing this.
you're only wanted for questioning now, but this is gonna bea full-fledged hunt.
don't have a choice Sam.
got to hope that Paxson's still keeping her distance from Matheson.
Hey, nice jacket. Very sharp. Real professional.
how good does he look, huh, Chuck?
Yeah, not bad, yeah.
Yeah, so, listen, this, uh, this guy Matheson is gonna size you up for the real jobs, hmm?
we'll just watch you, Tommy. We'll do what you do.
good. Yeah, you do what I do. All right. Just don't talk too much, okay?
we ready? Okay. Let's go.
building up an asset is a little like raising a kid. - They're good.
you can give him the tools to succeed, but when the first day of school rolls around, they're on their own.
well, well, well. How about that? Tommy's got a crew now.
how about that, huh? Let me introduce you. This is Milo, Brianna, big Chuck.
they're from up north, like I told you. Milo did some timeup in Allendale, like me.
you a tough guy, Milo? - I'm tough enough.
I've been wanting to get you guys together for a while.
we're getting real tight together, and I heard you were, you know, putting a big job together.
I thought maybe we could get in on it.
you want to talk louder, Tommy? - What?
you want to talk louder, maybe so a few more people I don't know can hear?
no, I was just -- - you got to think.
these people could be anybody. They could be cops, right?
Yeah, they're not cops. - They could be feds, right?
they're not cops. They're my crew. - Shut up.
see this one? This one's got a cop haircut.
Yeah, you. You wearing a wire, cop?
a cop? Yeah, right.
Hey, I thought you guys already searched us, or did he just want to get in my pants?
well, maybe I should frisk this one again.
what do you say, sweetheart? Do you need a good frisking?
try me.
they're not cops.
I hit the dry cleaner's last night on 17th.
these guys did it with me. It was like clockwork. They're real pros, man.
all right. You know what? If Tommy says you're pros, I might have something. Yeah.
Yeah. Why don't you and me talk? Come on.
Yeah. Milo, I-I'll catch you at the track, all right?
want a drink? - Yeah, no.
let's get some drinks over here, all right?
you should have seen these guys in action, you know?
seriously, Michael, I think Tommy's gonna have a heart attack before we get any information.
relax, Tommy. I'm sold. I'm taking you on a job.
I'm in? - Yep.
you're moving up in the world. - Thank you, Mr. Matheson.
I won't let you down.
we're gonna hit that meth labin little Dominica tomorrow.
and after we bust in, it's gonna take about a minute before the dealers show up.
all right, you're gonna drive the van.
your crew -- they're gonna lock down the front of the place, okay, handling security.
Yeah. Those dealers -- they have, like, machine guns, right?
there's got to be another way, right?
why don't you leave the planning to me, Tommy?
how long you been on me to take you on a job?
a while. - You trying to back out?
I'm -- I'm good. I'm -- I'm in. We're in.
I got to take my shot, right? - Yeah.
I'm moving up. - Yeah. You're moving up.
I'm gonna need you to get a van and a four-door.
just get your crew, and we do this. - All right.
we're in.
how'd it go? - It was good.
he, uh, he liked you guys. He really liked you guys.
Oh, that's great, Tommy. So, what's the job? What's the job?
about that, uh... - Tommy.
there's -- there's no job, not this time.
I'm -- I'm sorry, okay?
what -- what is this?
you tryingto cut us out? I need this job.
you can't do that to us.
Hey, you don't tell me what I can do, all right?
you don't understand.
this guy was gonna get you killed just to make a few bucks.
that ain't gonna happen. You guys are out.
go back up north or something. Get the hell out of town.
Tommy, what are you talking about?
we -- this is all good. We're a tight crew. We can do this.
work in intelligence long enough, and you get good at predicting human behavior, but sometimes, people surprise you.
listen, Milo, a while back, I met this Mathesonat the track, and he says I could do some stuff for him,
sell hot stereosand stuff like that.
I thought if I got a crew together, maybe I could, you know, move up the ladder, but that ain't me. It ain't me.
and when they do, you can surprise yourself.
Tommy, I gotto tell you something.
I wanted in on the heist because I'm trying to take Matheson down.
Oh, so you lied to me?
not quite. - What, you a cop or something?
no, not quite. I'm not a cop. I'm a good guy.
you're a good guy? - You were gonna show up tomorrow without us.
Matheson would have had you killed. You know that, right?
Yeah, I know that.
Matheson's hurt a lot of people, and he's gonna keep doing it.
but we'regonna take him down. We need your help.
I thought we'd just go to the cops. You don't know Matheson like I do.
he'll kill us all. I'm serious.
so are we. He's outmaneuvered the cops before.
no, we need to get him caughtred-handed. Fi.
Fi? - Uh, Brianna's Fiona.
can you get us that impala that we stole from the dry cleaner's?
right where I left it.
we're gonna need to time out the police response to the meth lab.
there's a substation right near there. I'm on it, brother.
wait a minute. W-what do I do here?
you're the key to this, Tommy.
as far as Matheson knows, we're all doing this job, just as he wants.
you need to find him the van he needs, and you need to get us the exact location of the heist so we can doour prep work.
okay. I can handle that.
it's gonnabe fine, Tommy. Just like clockwork.
ahh, nothing like driving a hot car with every cop in the city searching for you.
hopefully, they're not searching too hard.
we can't have Paxson showing up now.
you think Tommy's gonna hold up?
we'll know soon enough.
that lab's right around the corner.
cooker's gonna go out for supplies in a bit. That's gonna be our window.
me and my guys, we go in the front, take out the alarm.
you three stay outside the door like Tommy told you, okay?
Tommy's the boss, right, Tommy? - Right.
Yeah. All right.
all you got to do is hold off a couple of meth heads while we take the stuff out the back.
Tommy's gonna drive around, pick us up, and we meet later to...
split the score.
all right, there he is.
let's do it. Look sharp, Tommy.
anything goes wrong, the dealers will be coming from there and there.
these guys gonna be armed or what?
eh, nothing you can't handle, killer.
Superglue's cheap, quiet, and powerful.
lay it on thick and force-dry it with canned air, and you can cut bonding time to less than a minute.
Mike, I am not in love with this tactical position, not evenwith Fi's prep work.
my "prep work," as you call it, could hold off an army.
Hey, I'm just saying.
I love explosivesas much as the next guy
we just need to keep the bad guys from killing each other until the cops get here.
by standing in between them?
why cook at home when there's takeout?
Oops.
Yes. Hello, police?
I'm at 17th and Palmin, uh, little Dominica.
I just saw some guys with automatic weapons.
okay, Yommy. Let's go.
the box --go! Come on!
Tommy, dude, move the van. Tommy!
the front.
come on! Come on!
yeah? - Uh, boss, I'm not sure about the plan.
it's almost like you were trying to get us killed out here.
all right. Look, open the door. Tommy screwed up. Something isn't right.
actually, I think it's you that screwed up.
you screwed up bad.
Oh, here are the cops. Got to run.
you're setting me up?
not used to being the guy in the trap, are you?
what made you think you could piss off every drug dealer and cop in town and not get any payback?
Oh, wait. That's your problem -- you don't think.
son of a bitch! - Let's go.
it's your lucky day, bitch.
I should get myself a lottery ticket.
and you should get yourself a lawyer.
detective, found the other getaway car on the street -- it's a silver'09 impala L. T.
a silver impala? Are you sure?
Yeah. You'll never believe what we found in the trunk.
C-4.
remember my 200-to-1 shot?
it's just him and me now.
time to go straight, Tommy.
if I ever see you in a police computer again...
you don't have to worry about that.
my mom's back in Saint Louis.
I was thinking, uh, I might move there, start a kennelor something.
sounds good.
Hey, thanks.
the way you and your friends had my back...
I think you guys are gonna be okay without me.
I closed my biggest case today.
Congratulations. - Thanks.
the thing is, he was a master criminal who managed to get stuck in a locked meth lab with c-4 in a getaway carparked outside.
tough break.
the funny thing is, is he's never been tied to any cases with c-4.
and that c-4 that was found in his trunk, it's the same used in seven explosions in the Miami area.
any thoughts?
well, it seems like you can close the books on those cases, or you can keep coming after me and have the case against Matheson unravel.
so I get Matheson and you get a free pass?
if I got a pass, which I'm not saying that I did, it was anything but free.
it's like I told you, detective, we're on the same side.
just remember where the line is, Mr. Westen.
I will be watching you.
I'd expect nothing less.
thanks for your call, Sam.
man... I was so mad at you.
when your name came across my desk, I thought, "this is it."
this is my chance to get you back.
well, I'm glad you found me.
Yeah. I am, too.
so, how about another drink, Sam? - Coming right up.
there you go. - Okay.
is there alcohol in this?
cause it's masked by sort ofa, uh, peachy citrus flavor.
it's called a fuzzy navel. It's not really my kind of thing, but we got to start you off easy, work your way upto the good stuff.
I got to tell you, Sam, you're like a -- you're likea drinking genius here.
I've forgotten more about the subject than you will ever know.
if I'm in a bar and I can't get the bartender's attention 'cause I need some information about a drink, would it be okay if I, would it be okay if I call you?
absolutely, Stacey. Anytime.
is this not the best audit ever?
I got rid of the rest of the c-4. Such a waste.
small price to pay for getting the cops off our back.
mm, I guess.
now that we're in the clear, there's a few gigs I've lined up for us.
Fi, this isn't a good time.
Paxson's backing off, but we still have no idea who's coming after me next.
I still need back in.
Michael, priorities change. People change.
Tommy always thought he'd be a criminal.
maybe you'll find...
you sure? - I'm sure.
I'm free of the people who burned me.
I'm clear of the cops.
this is the moment I've been waiting for.
this is moment I've been waiting for, too.
let's just enjoy dinner.
my name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing...
no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
should we shoot them?
an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.
family, too...
Hey, is that your mom again?
if you're desperate.
someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line -- as long as you're burned...you're not going anywhere.
there are advantages to training with someone you're close to.
knowing each other's moves makes training more effective.
but being involved in each other's personal lives can also make training a lot more painful.
is there something you want to talk about, Fi?
not really.
I know you're not thrilled about me reaching out to the intelligence community.
no. I don't have a problem with it.
you want your old job back.
I said I'd be supportive.
not a problem.
are you expecting company?
that's like two days' worth of yogurt.
that is either a brilliantly disguised bomb, or somebody knows the way to your heart.
and they're shy.
they didn't stick around.
a thank-you gift from a client?
well, that's the most you've ever been paid for a job.
pretty soon, you'll be able to stop bumming money from me.
it's a gift from your agency friends, isn't it?
could be.
good for you.
looks like you're getting back in.
meeting a new operative is a lot like going on a blind date.
you're bound to be nervous the first couple of times you do it.
but live through a few, and you get to be an expert.
you should arrive early, prepare an exit strategy, and know you could be in for an ugly surprise.
you know, I figured you'd run surveillance from the bistro 'cause of the sight lines, but, uh, you're the spy, right?
this place is better.
better escape routes, better iced tea.
so, Michael, you like the yogurt?
no, I haven't tried it yet.
I was always taught "never take yogurt from strangers."
well, let's not be strangers.
name's Tom Strickler.
and what is it that you do, Tom?
match people with opportunities.
it's a bit like an agent.
a man with your skills is extremely valuable, as I'm sure you're aware, and, uh, I just make sure all that doesn't go to waste.
Strickler agent to the spies.
you're operating in Miami with no resources, no operational support.
that's no way to live.
it's not safe, for you or the people you care about.
and you're the solution to that?
Yeah. I'm not asking you to change a thing.
you get to just keep doing what comes naturally.
and what is that?
surviving.
you're great at surviving.
now, you're a man with enemies. We know that.
but your enemies have enemies of their own,
people that'll pay to have you take care of their problems.
it's called synergy.
the enemy of your enemy is your financial opportunity.
what's in it for you?
10%.
I'm putting together a deal for you now, actually.
I heard a rumor about, uh, an old associate of yours who's making a move to Miami.
figure the smart money's on Michael Westen in that little fight.
and you're the smart money.
any more details on this old associate?
still working on that.
apparently, there's some Ukrainian who's very upset about an op you ran in the '90s.
I'll let you know more as I get the details.
Yeah, sorry. I'm not a killer for hire.
Oh, well, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
this might be a killing thing. It might not.
let me do my homework, and, uh, we'll discuss.
there's nothing to discuss.
well, the thing is, this guy's coming one way or another.
Tom... - Okay.
okay. You have my number. We'll talk soon.
unless the Ukrainian cuts your tongue out first, right?
so, who's the secret admirer?
whoever they are, they have good taste in yogurt.
his name's Strickler.
he says someone I crossed paths with in the Ukraine is in town, looking to settle an old score.
and he's here to profit from any bloodshed.
charming.
who's the Ukrainian?
Strickler claims not to know, which is inconvenient, because there's quite a few people from that region who would like to see me stop breathing.
I know a guy, goes by "Beck."
he might be able to help.
he's made a lot of money for some very powerful people over there.
if there's a Ukrainian in town, he'll be able to fill you in.
based in Miami?
started as a local gangster and went big-time.
he hijacks cargoand ships it, like fedex with a kalashnikov set.
he's about as connected as a Miami hustler who doesn't speak Russian can get.
think you can get me a meeting?
you might not want me as your go-between.
I may have intercepted a couple of his shipments once.
sparkly new P90s, Michael.
they deserved a good home.
so I get to walk up to him cold? Great.
well, at least you'll geta good cup of coffee.
I know his favorite spot.
Yeah, Sam.
Yeah, Mike, uh, I'm at your mom's.
she got some curtains from a guy named Tom Strickler.
is this a business associate of yours?
put it this way --you know that broker that contacted you in east Germany in '89?
Yeah, Mueller --tried to pay me to "accidentally" blow up a factory during an operation.
bloodsucker.
I have my own parasite.
some Ukrainian's in town looking for me.
if I can get to him before he gets to me...
Strickler cuts you a check, and you're one step closer to being a mercenary.
what are you gonna do?
try and run down the Ukrainian through a contact of Fi's.
Sam, can you...
check out Strickler? I'm on it.
no one else gave me a house-rewarming present, not even the guy who blew up my house.
Maddy, I thought we were over that.
forgiveness is a process.
pick me up some curtain rods, and maybe.
fine. Curtain rods. You got it.
the cold approach is something you try to avoid in intelligence work.
you want to ease into a relationship over time.
when that's impossible, you just have to turn on the charm and hope for the best.
John Beck, right?
name is Michael.
I heard that you might be able to help me with a little situation.
word is you're a guy with connections.
that's what they say.
Beck guy with connections.
I just need a little information.
and why should I give it to you?
I'm a good friend to have.
let me explain something to you, man.
I don't have friends.
I'm a businessman.
I got rivals. I got associates.
I even got a few enemies.
but friends? Sorry. That's not how I roll.
I just need help tracking down a Ukrainian who might be in town looking for me.
sounds like you're in a bind.
could be. That's what I'm trying to find out.
good luck.
not my problem.
a while ago, one of your shipments of P90s was diverted.
I can make sure that kind of thing stops.
see, I don't like people in my business.
this here friendship has gotten off to a bad start.
friendships are about give and take.
you give me the information, I will take care of your shipment issues.
how about I give you one more chance to get out of here before I shoot you in the face?
that UkrainianI mentioned,
he brought a few extra guys into town with him.
a flash-bang grenade temporarily impairs hearing and vision.
I'd get down.
it makes fighting back or attempting escape futile and dangerous to civilians.
so if you have to shoot blind, it's better to use a camera than a gun.
that was a short meeting.
get him now!
they were together, take them both.
in a hostage situation, the same things that get you killed will extend your life.
Hey, hey, hey, look, I don't know who you guys are, okay?
but I got no problem with you, and I guarantee that you don't want no problems with me or the people that I work with, huh?
so let's just cut this thing off right here.
no harm, no foul.
everybody goes home.
and we just --we just forget all about it.
if you have money, you'll live till you pay.
if you have information, you'll live till you talk.
Hey, come on! Look, you got the wrong guy!
I'm not a part of this.
I just met him for the first time five minutes ago.
what do you think they're gonna do?
drop you off at Starbucks, give you a couple of bucks for a cup of coffee?
shut up. We'll figure it out.
come on. I'm serious, man! You got the wrong guy!
and if you have nothing, you're pretty much disposable.
the coward thinks...
he can buy his life...by betraying me.
we bring them both to Chechik, let him decide what he wants to do.
excuse me.
we need to keep this area clear.
Oh, well... you know, I was --I was here, and I--I ran out when those men showed up.
and my husband --he's still here.
go ahead. Go ahead.
Yeah, Fi.
Sam, I'm at the cafe where Michael was meeting Beck.
what's wrong?
he's gone.
so is Beck.
an extraction team -- professionals, from what I'm overhearing.
Jesus. You think Mikey's Ukrainian made his move already?
well, he moved quicker than anyone expected.
wait a second.
Michael's cell.
he took a picture of the team.
you know what? We got to find Strickler.
maybe he can put some names to these faces.
I don't trust that guy.
Yeah, well, he's all we got.
Plus, it'll give us a chance to kick his teeth in.
well, I'm wearing my teeth-kicking heels.
see you in five.
is something wrong?
uh, no. Not at all.
why would you think that?
so why you packing your gun and your bullet proof vest?
look, it's nothing to worry about. I just got to run an errand.
Really?
so tell me about this errand.
are we close? Thirty minutes.
after the adrenaline rush of an operation comes a crash.
heightened reflexes and awareness don't last.
two boring hours of driving later, even the sharpest killing machine lets down his guard.
you don't want to meet this guy Chechik.
when it's time, get to the back door and open it.
what are you doing?
just remember --set your jaw.
you traitor! You son of a...
are you thinking of selling me out to Chechik?!
I will kill you!
you have to head into the trees.
Hey, I got nothing to do with this!
I don't even know him!
what do you want, an apology? Let's go!
after them, now!
look, Maddy, how many times do we have to go over this?
I mean, we're just doing a little practice thing.
Mike is fine, I swear.
you're gonna hear some swearing if you don't tell me the truth.
Sam, what is taking you so long?
Oh, look! There's fiona.
she never shows up when there's trouble.
I'm telling you, there's no trouble.
Fi's just here to pick me up for... a movie.
Really?
well, I'm in the mood for a matinee.
should I bring a gun, too?
don't you patronize me.
I have a right to know what's happening with my son.
did I fall apart the last time you told me what was going on?
someone took Michael.
they took him? Where?
well, that's what we need to find out.
the second you find out anything, I expect you to call me.
okay, Maddy.
Sam, let me remind you, you are staying in my guest room, all right?
you call me, or god as my witness, I will smother you in your sleep.
all right, all right. We'll call.
stop, stop, stop right now!
look, Beck, we don't have time for this.
you want to shoot me?
you'll have the same problem, just with one less bullet.
Yeah, well, maybe I'll drag your ass back to that road as a peace offering.
I deal with Russians all the time.
you speak the language?
no. I got guys for that.
well, you better learn fast.
Chechik didn't hire goodwill ambassadors.
they're not gonna wait for a translator to show up before they start shooting.
so maybe I'll put a bullet in your head in front of them, huh?
that don't require a lot of translation.
listen, Beck, I got you into this. I will get you out.
if we head east.
what? You want to go deeper into the woods?!
we got enough problems without adding alligators to the list.
you go whatever way you want.
I'm going -- I'm -- I'm --I'm going this way.
Beck, save your ammo -- a few days wandering around here starving, you're gonna want to eat that last bullet.
if you want to survive, Beck, follow me.
you missed a spot.
hello.
you're Michael's friend, right?
where is he?
want a mojito?
don't look so concerned, sweetheart.
let me guess -- our favorite spy is in a bit of a jam, and you're hoping I can get him out.
I wish it was that simple.
I was the one telling him to keep his head down till I could find out more about who was after him.
And?
I have some calls out.
you've got some calls out?
I suggest you try harder.
no need for theatrics.
I want Michael alive as much as the next guy.
unless, of course, the next guy's Ukrainian.
you know that fella?
michael took this picture before he was snatched.
Oh, yeah. I know that pretty boy.
his name's Vlad Byrubin Balubin?
Ugh, "B" something.
anyway, last time I checked, he's part of a criminal syndicate run by Pyotr Chechik.
that rings a bell.
Mikey met him back in '97 when he blew up a...
well, let's just say that he really hates Mikey.
where can we find Chechik?
huh, well, guys with records like him don't cross borders too easily.
if he is in Miami, he didn't fly commercial.
I know some of the pilots that do the Miami/Eastern Europe route.
could put out some feelers.
give me a couple of hours.
I'm not giving you a couple minutes.
I want names now.
when on the run, subtle things like broken branches, flattened grass, and disturbed ground can give you away to an expert tracker.
an inexperienced tracker may require a more obvious trail.
what is this?
you trying to get us killed?
no, followed -- we need to lead them deeper in, turn their strengths to weaknesses.
their bullet proof vests will get hotter, their guns will get heavy.
we got to get them farther from their supplies.
whatever you got planned, okay, they're far enough already.
Beck, listen to me.
no, you listen to me.
I grew up in the Florida backwoods, man.
I spent my whole life trying to get out.
I fought my way down to Miami so I'd never have to swat bugs in another damn mangrove swamp, and now you just dragged me back.
man, I say we make our stand right here.
you want to make a stand?
Yes.
can we make the stand over there?
okay.
still think you can take them?
there's five of them.
I got five rounds.
Oh, that's your plan?
you have a 100% kill rate with a handgun?
look, it's better than running around in a damn swamp!
I ain't too bad with a gun.
I might teach you something.
you fire, they'll get our position.
they'll flank us and pin us down.
we have to separate them.
we got to lead them just a little farther in.
and then we strike?
looks like the guy Strickler said flew Chechik into the country.
why anyone would allow him to pilot a plane is beyond me.
Oh, great. A drunk with a gun.
this calls for subtlety.
I can do subtlety.
I don't like to.
but I can.
what is a sweet, little girl like you doing in a big, bad bar like this?
I'm looking for a big, bad man... mm...
like you.
come with me or say goodbye to your two closest friends.
we got a few hundred yards on them.
give me your shoelaces.
look, I may not be Rambo, okay, but if you're making a trap.
it doesn't have to work.
they'll see it. They'll figure we're close.
they'll fan out, and we'll injure one of them.
we're injuring them?
it'll slow them down.
if I have to drag a complaining pain in the ass through the woods, they can, too.
now give me your shoelaces.
you know what --maybe it's time we listen to the guy with a gun for a while.
fine.
now give me your shoelaces.
Mr. Smartass.
all right. Let's try this again.
give me your shoelaces. Please.
hello. Yeah, Maddy. You wanted me to call, so I'm calling.
did you find Michael?
no, but we found some guy who might be able to tell us where he is.
look, we're leaving hall and ale right now.
we're heading over to the loft to ask him some questions.
you bring him here instead.
it's closer than Michael's loft, and you don't have time to waste.
fanning out in a search pattern is a great way to cover a lot of area, but it also divides your forces.
stand back! Stand back!
don't. We need him alive, remember?
you want to hit him again?
military units are a lot like marching bands.
take out the guy conducting the operation, and you'll throw everyone out of sync.
the bastards wrecked my knee.
pretty soon, all you have left is sound and fury.
Hey, we got two guns, explosives, a serious knife.
we could even the odds real quick.
not until they call Chechik. We need to lure him out here.
what are you talking about?
if we get Chechik, we can end this. It's the only way.
what, you want more men out here?
when you started out, who was the biggest hijacker in Miami?
Cuban guy -- Montez.
how did you take him down?
well, I paid one of his guys to let me into his place, and then I stuck a gun in his mouth until he decided to move back to L. A.
you dealt with the problem at the top. That's what we're doing here.
but what if they don't call Chechik?
they will. They're in over their heads, and they know it.
see?
don't get cocky.
you've been running up frequent-flier miles with a lot of shady characters.
I wonder what the FBI would think.
I told you, man. All I do is fly the plane.
I doubt the boys in suits would see it that way.
see, Chechik is a bad guy. War crimes, murder for hire.
why do you think I'm keeping my mouth shut?
that guy is more afraid of Chechik than he is of us.
we're gonna have to squeeze him harder.
if by "squeeze"you mean "choke"?
he can't talk if he can't breathe, Fi.
he can whisper. I have good hearing.
you push him too hard, he's gonna snap, okay?
and then he's just gonna start making crap up.
Sam Axe's wisdom.
how you doing?
you comfortable? You need anything?
mind if I sit?
you want a cigarette?
mind if I do?
sorry. I don'tmean to bother you. It's just I need a little peace and quiet.
they get loud when they're angry.
luckily, this place is well-insulated.
you can't even hear a peep from outside.
probably why they like it so much.
I'm sorry. I hope I didn't give you the wrong impression.
I have never once, ever, ever seen them make anyone suffer.
if they don't think you'll break, they end it quick.
you sure you don't want a cigarette?
it's good for the nerves.
it's not like you have to worry about getting cancer anymore.
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?
there you go.
good, huh?
I don't micromanage you. - I'm not micromanaging you, either.
he dropped them off by seaplane a few hours ago -- a small cabin in the middle of the swamp.
there's no address, but I got the latitude and longitude.
how?
Oh, honey, I've met guys like this before.
they're only brave when people are yelling at them.
so you gonna go get my son, or do I have to do that, too?!
when fighting in the wilderness, the biggest threats are often the ones you don't see
dehydration...
...exhaustion, and nerves.
but boatloads of hostiles don't help, either.
there's Chechik. - Damn!
is there a russian word for "hard-ass"?
if we can get him into the woods, we'll have enough cover to separate him from his men.
we wanted Chechik. There he is.
Yeah, along with more men, more guns, and damn airboats, man!
we take out Chechik, and all those guys will come after us.
the men who work for you -- if you were taken out, what would they do?
shoot the bastards who did it.
Really? You really think so?
you said you had no friends. All right, think like a businessman.
how long would they stomp around in this swamp once the guy who cuts their checks is out of commission?
Hey, how you doing?
Yeah, how you doing?
Hey, what'll it take to rent one of these babies for a couple hours?
90 bucks, plus insurance.
$25 for basic coverage, $15 for supplemental liability.
does that cover small-arms fire?
uh, what my friend here is saying is, uh, we're not big on paperwork.
50 extra bucks, you guys weren't even here.
look. We just disappeared.
thank you, sir.
that's Chechik.
some things never change.
so, we get him when he goes into the woods, huh?
only he ain't going into the woods.
we have to get him to move. The point is...
the point is that you wanted them to call for backup.
and they did, okay, and now we're out numbered five to one.
in battle, not even the best-laid plans survive contact with the enemy.
if you want to survive, you have to be willing to improvise.
all right, if you distract his men -- wait, wait, wait!
distract a dozen guys with guns?
forget it! You and me are done!
I'd rather take my chances with Mr. Hard-ass over there.
Beck, stop. Beck!
you're gonna get yourself killed.
so, what you gonna do, shoot me, huh?
give away your position?
of course, there's such a thing as too much improvisation.
Hey, it's like you said. I'm a businessman.
I got something they want. Now it's time to negotiate.
I want to make a deal!
you want Westen, I can give you Westen!
come on! Get up.
you think you can reach that bank underwater?
guess I have to.
they went in the river.
you know, I should have shot you when you first interrupted my coffee.
let's not dwellon missed opportunities.
you know, I got 25 people on my payroll.
and here I am, alone in the middle of nowhere, about to die from a damn leg wound!
well, you're not alone.
the hell I'm not. What, you gonna stick around and watch me die?
no. We're gonna get through this together.
what? What are you, crazy?
you've seen what happens to people with leg wounds out here.
look, it doesn't have to be that way.
but you have to decide right now.
are you ready to trust me and figure out a plan, or do you want to die out here alone?
is it really that tough of a call?
delaying tactics aren't the most glamorous part of a battle plan, but they're often the most important.
slowing the enemy down buys you time to prepare the ground ahead of you, and that, more than almost anything else, wins battles.
where is your friend?
I got nothing to say to you.
where is Michael?
why should I tell you? You're just gonna kill me anyway!
maybe. Maybe not.
you're nobody. I'm here for Westen.
you tell me where he is, and I'll give you some water and bandages for the wound.
you see this?
I swear on the cross, on the eyes of my children.
all right. Fine.
he went that way. There's a swamp where the airboats can't go.
the pilot dropped Chechik a few miles up.
if Michael's not there, I hope you brought bug spray.
that must be Chechik's airboat.
they got to be close.
for a spy, there's no shame in retreat.
when faced with a more powerful enemy, you're trained to get out of the way and keep moving.
it's not about running away or giving up.
the goal of any retreat is to find the right place to marshal your resources and make a stand.
military history is filled with stories of small forces taking on larger ones.
whether it's david fighting goliath or the french resistance fighting the nazis, the strategy is basically the same -- you have to choose the right ground, deploy your resources carefully, and remember that the greatest weapon in any battle is surprise.
give me the radio.
here we are again, after so many years -- you, me, plenty of guns.
I almost forgot how much I enjoyed the hunt.
you know, I thought after serving 10 years for war crimes you would have found a new hobby.
Oh, 10 years just made me want to find you more.
never get over the one that got away.
well, I'm flattered.
you brought a whole army just to find little old me?
times change, Michael.
an army that big, I got to fold my laundry.
I work for Fedor Markov now.
Markov? You know, I liked you kgb officers better before you sold out.
you know, at least you believed in something.
you should be happy, Michael.
we all live American dream, dream spies like you helped make.
open borders, free markets. Everyone's friends.
look at me --Ukrainian with Russian team, German weapons, funding from the west.
so many backgrounds, so many people working together just to drag every secret out of Michael Westen's head before we cut it off and feed it to the dogs.
but enough talk.
as much as I'd like to catch up, you should have turned your radio off.
you should stick to hunting things that don't fight back.
get your men to drop their guns, or you're a dead man.
all right, all right.
guns down now.
it's nothing you have to worry about any more.
get up.
Thanks, man.- Easy-peasy, huh?
I expect some serious memory loss. You understand?
Yeah, yeah.
you think this is over?
Shevchenkos look out for their own. Markov will find you.
don't you know it's rude to drop names?
Yeah, stupid, too.
especially when a "nobody" like me can drop bigger ones.
all those kgb colonels in the Russian mafia?
well, they work for an old kgb general who happens to be a business associate of mine.
now, I don't want to name names, but he can controls about 800 miles of the siberian oil pipeline.
Yeah.
Yeah, I do all their import/export work.
you nearly cost them a lot of money today.
I'm gonna have to give them a call, see how they feel about that.
I give you $50, 000, and I swear you'll never see me again.
I know I won't. Get this fool out of here.
stop. $100, 000.
don't be stupid! Come on!
there's not enough money in the world.
Mikey, next time you get kidnapped, can you stay out of the everglades?
there ain't gonna be no next time, at least not for these boys.
and you still owe me a shipment of P90s. Don't think I forgot.
I'll make sure they get to you.
you know, one day, I think we're gonna look back on this as a nice day out in nature.
Yeah, don't push it.
I'll just say this.
you said you were a good friend to have.
could do worse.
so... what brings you two out to this neck of the woods?
Oh, well, you know, it's such a sunny day.
I thought you might need these.
I'm beginning to think I should get you one of those harness things.
you know, like they have for toddlers.
you've been wandering off a little too much these days.
it's nothing I can't handle, mom.
no, see, you don't get to act that casual when I'm interrogating strange men in my garage to save your life.
I'm sorry about that, mom.
whatever.
getting answers out of him was a hell of a lot easier than getting them out of you.
be careful.
okay?
so, do you like my new curtains?
you hung your curtains by yourself?
actually, no. Some very nice people came over and did it.
they were sent over by your friend Strickler.
wonderful.
try not to wrinkle them when you're sweeping them for bugs.
no gift basket?
Michael, so nice to have you back in town.
uh, no, no gift basket. I got you something better
your share of the Ukrainian deal.
turns out a group of baltic separatists wanted Chechik out of the picture just as much as you did.
some quick negotiating on my part, and, voil?
your day-trip to the swamp paid for itself.
I didn't fight off Chechik for the cash.
I know. You did it for you.
this is just a wonderful by-product.
and this is just the beginning. I can get you whatever you want, Michael.
let me save you some time, Strickler. I'm never gonna work with you.
not for the money, not for the yogurt, for the curtains.
I'm not a mercenary.
okay.
but, Michael, you got to ask yourself this. What is it that you want?
what is it that you deserve?
a man with your skills, with your background, burned, out in the cold, with nothing?
don't answer right now. Just think about it.
I'll be around.
I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing -
no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
should we shoot them?
an old friend who used to inform on you to the fbI...
you know spies --a bunch of bitchy little girls.
family, too...
Hey, is that your mom again?
if you're desperate.
someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line -- as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
when you prepare for a mission, it's the little things that count.
firepower is great, but an operation's more likely to be saved by a fresh set of batteries than a gun.
bring a camera.
that's all he told you about this gig?
Strickler plays it close the vest.
and you're just going right along with it?
I don't have much choice.
if I want my old job back, he's the guy that can make it happen.
the fact that he's a weasel doesn't give you pause?
Fi, right now he's the only dance partner I have.
you know what I mean.
he's my ticket back in, Fi.
Strickler Michael's ticket back in
Fiona glenanne, always a pleasure.
pleasure's all yours.
okay, well, I'd love to stay and chat, but Michael and I have work to do.
ready to go, Michael?
Michael, I know how much this job means to you...
but if it doesn't feel right, promise me you'll walk away.
Fi, I have to go.
I sense you're not entirely comfortable with this arrangement, Michael, so I just want to remind you what's at stake.
you do this, and you have my word, the powers that be will review your burn notice.
your word?
laugh if you like, but I wouldn't be drivin gan Aston martin if I didn't know how to keep a promise.
you'll get your call from Washington.
tell me about the job.
that is a safe house for an American intelligence agency, and they use it to store weaponsfor missions abroad.
now, what if I told your know the exact moment that it's left unguarded?
don't worry. I'm not asking you to steal them.
somebody's already taking care of that.
I got word that thieves were ripping off a stash of military equipment.
we should alert the owners.
Oh, we will, but timing is everything.
now, I paid a hefty sum to learn that they're selling the stuff on Friday, but nobody knows the buyer or the location.
that's where you come in, superstar.
the crew has a cleaner.
Ding, ding, ding. Give this man a prize.
he's the key to tracking the sale.
I'm no ace operative, but I'd say a picture of his license plate would be helpful.
heists are like parties -- the worst part is cleaning up.
someone has to stay behind to get rid of all the evidence.
the cleaner
of course, tidying up after a heist often involves methods not suitable for parties.
moment of truth, Michael.
you are going somewhere?
Yep. Going out with Ms. Reynolds.
got new underwear and everything.
buddy of mine's goanna loan me his villa.
got a full bar, hot tub with a 14-jet water-massage system.
nice. Any luck running that license plate for me with your cop buddies?
Yeah, but, mike, I mean, come on. Are you really working with Strickler?
the guy's a parasite.
he can help clear my name.
I don't get to be choosy.
anyway, look, the car was rented with a stolen visa, so that's no surprise, but get this -
same card bought gas three times in a neighborhood in doral.
And?
well, the only place out there that doesn't ask for I. D. When you check in is the wages motel.
so, I'll bet you a minty moji to that's where he's hiding out.
great work, Sam.
I need to get eyes on him before he makes a move.
hold your horses there, cowboy.
the motel is right across the street from a bingo parlor.
you're not gonna blend in with the senior citizens, so we got to set up some kind of rotating surveillance in a storefront down the street.
Oh, do me a favor.
uh, that kind of wrecks the top of them.
just a... little fold is good.
do you have a better idea?
look, don't shut me down right away, mike, but I'm thinking this could work better if we had someone who could blend in with bingo...
somebody we trust, someone close to home...
you talking about my mom?
look, it's only a watching job, so there's gonna be other people around.
she should be fine.
I'll talk to her.
Oh, uh, yeah, about that -- I should mention...
um, she's been a little out of sorts since the roof started leaking.
leaking? How bad we talking? - Uh, pretty bad.
for some crazy reason, she thinks it has to do with the time I blew up the house.
strictly need-to-know, mike.
anyway, Fi's in there helping clean up.
will there be any shooting?
no, mom -- no shooting.
all you'll be doing is watching.
damn it! See?!
every time it rains, I'm telling you, this place turns into noah's ark.
mom, I'll fix the roof.
I need your help.
fine.
it'll be good to get out of the house.
I'll get my purse.
really, Michael?
it's one thing for you to do this job but involving your mom?
I'm just adapting to the needs of the operation, Fi.
yeah? - Mike! Mike, you're there. Thank god. It's Barry.
look, um, you know all those favors you owe me?
I'm calling in all of them.
bar, I'm right in the middle of something -
I'm at the Carlito, and bring Fiona, cause this could get a little...violent.
Yeah, I'll be right there.
what's going on, Barry?
someone stole my ledger, mike.
the list of my clients and all the accounts where, uh...protect their money.
so, what, it's like a little black book for money launderers?
Yeah, only instead of blondes named Chloe,
I got a bunch of angry rich guys who are gonna dismember me when they find out it's gone.
you keep that all written down in one place?
Yeah, I know. It's part of my sales pitch
you keep data on a computer, it's like open season for hackers and the I. R.S.
so I run things old-school, you know?
anyway, I got a phone call this morning.
this new friend -- he wants $5 million by Thursdayor he's gonna...sell the ledger!
and if somebody starts blackmailing my clients, it's like...
Seriously? You're gonna make me beg?
I need help, mike.
I say beg.
we're not gonna make you beg.
Barry the client
any idea who's behind this?
I kept the ledger in a private storage space that I took out under an alias.
could someone have followed you to it?
Unh-unh, no. When I got there, I keep, like, an eye over both shoulders, like, simultaneously.
was anything else in your storage space besides the ledger?
no, it was just the ledger, some cash, and a little paper work Amy asked me to hold on to.
uh, girlfriend. Yeah, we're going on three months now.
this scumbag stole her will and the deed to her house.
she's gonna be pissed, and when Amy gets pissed -- ouch.
Barry, you ever hear of a tr ojan horse?
you put a tracker on a document, you give it to someone to hide, and then...
follow the signal back to the hiding place.
a tracker on a document?
Jesus, they can do that?
standard technique.
no. No, no, no. That's impossible.
Amy's in Atlanta taking care of her aunt.
she was out of town the same week that the ledger disappeared?
what, you don't think Amy -- I mean, come on, she's, like, my special lady.
Oh, man.
don't worry, Barry. We'll sort it out.
all right, we've got some lucky people here today...
anyone trained in counter-surveillance knows most field ops are between 22, when people finish training, and 55, when they retire, which is why even wary operatives don't usually pay attention to kids or anyone on social security.
how was that?
casual enough?
it's just fine, Maddy.
now, look, you're just playing bingo.
just think of this as a normal afternoon.
a normal afternoon, I'd be in my aqua-aerobics class, not being afraid someone's gonna shoot at me.
no one's gonna get shot.
just keep a low profile.
now, if you see our guy, don't stare, don't take pictures, don't do anything -- just call us, okay?
okay.
just remember --low profile, Maddy.
I got it, sam.
under the "I," 26. I-26.
Bingo!
we have a winner!
I still think we're wasting our time going after Amy.
her aunt Sandy has, like, type 2 diabetes.
stay calm, Barry. Michael's just doing a perimeter check.
we have a range rover parked out back, music blaring inside the house.
either aunt Sandy made a miracle recovery or Amy never left town.
I bought her that car.
love is a fragile thing, Barry.
wait here. We'll be right back.
fresh scratches.
looks like someone beat us to it.
Hey, you're trespassing.
you must be Amy.
Amy Barry's "special lady
Yeah, I don't know who you people are, but you've got exactly five seconds to get the hell off my property.
there's no need for drama.
we just want to have a conversation.
I warned her.
a ledger?
look, I don't know anything about it. I-I could sue, you know.
Amy, you think people running a $5-million extortion scheme are just gonna let you walk away?
you're a loose end.
there's a trembler switch under the driver's side of your car -- not bad work.
put any weight on that seat, and it'll blow up like it's made of solid gasoline.
somebody wants you dead, Amy.
you want to tell us what's going on?
a "trembler switch"? Yeah, right, whatever you say.
you know what? I'm calling the cops.
I think a demonstration is in order.
wait a minute. What are you doing? That's my car!
No! What? No! What are you doing?! No!
Oh, my god!
trembler switch.
voil?
Oh, my god.
okay. But he was gonna pay me$100, 000.
I like Barry, but 100k --are you kidding me?
do you remember his name?
I-I-I-I can't remember his name. He was some kind of foreign.
where did you meet him?
at a house in coconut grove.
okay, that's all I know! I swear to god!
it's time to leave town, Amy.
Oh, a window, mike? I mean, shouldn't we just pick the lock on the door, you know, like civilized people?
the back door is too exposed.
searching a pre-furnished house is pretty straightforward.
without a lot of furniture or customized safes, there aren't many great hiding places.
so once you've checked all the usual "slicks" -- the spots pros would use -
you're stuck calling it a day or ripping out the drywall.
it's not here, mike.
Yeah, Fi?
you've got company.
get out of there, Michael.
time to go?
we leave now, they'll know we were here.
Barry's ledger disappears forever.
what exactly are you proposing, mike?
we owe him, Sam.
man and a woman.
get out of there.
get out of there.
welcome home.
we need to talk.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
shut up!
that's no way to treat a lady.
tell us where the ledger is.
you want to know where the ledger is?
fine. I'll tell you.
see? I was afraid something like that was gonna happen.
Oh, no. Hey, lady? Don't -- don't -- don't. Stop that.
get some pillow cases.
we're gonna need head bags.
head bags"?
Oh, goody.
so, you just kidnapped him?
not so loud, Barry.
we swept the house. There's no ledger.
we're just gonna have to ask our new guests where to find it.
okay, so break out the electrodes.
I heard you can attach them to a car battery, spark it up, and get -
torture just gets you the fastest lie to make the pain stop.
look, Mikey and me are gonna interrogate them, so don't worry your spiky little head.
we'll get them talking.
can you do it quick?
I got clients coming to town, and without the ledger,
I don't know if their money's in the Caymans or in the Seychelles.
Yeah, about that -- you should avoid your clients for a while.
I'm known for my customer service.
don't you think they're gonna get a little suspicious if I stop taking calls?
mm, dodge calls now or bullets later.
fair enough.
all right, I'll be in touch.
well, Mikey, I guess we better get at it -- running out of time before. Reynolds and I blow town.
Sam, um, I don't want to mess things up, but this might take a while.
Plus, I need a big, private space to work two captivesats the same time.
how many days do you Andms. Reynolds have that villa?
Mike, if there's one thing you would never do to me, it's ruin my love-capade with ms. Reynolds.
I mean, come on, you cannot expect me to just...
you know, Mike, uh...sometimes it's hard being your friend.
Yeah, straight-up.
well, I got to call ms. Reynolds, explain why she's not get ting her sammy time.
she's not gonna like it.
Ooh, I'm sure she'll get by.
Yeah, mom?
Michael, he's here --your cleaning friend.
he just parked his car.
okay, mom. Calm down, calm down.
I know what I'm doing.
but if you want to know where he goes, you better get over here before he leaves again.
great work, mom.
Yeah, well...don't forget my roof.
I know, mom.
she found the cleaner.
I should probably help Sam with the interrogations.
could you -- - yep --set up a tail on him, see if he scoutsa location for his deal.
Thanks, Fi.
the bar inside, mike --nine different kinds of rum.
now, ms. Reynolds and rum?
I'm sorry we're using your love nest as a holding cell, Sam.
well, I just didn't expect to be wearing pants here.
look, I'm over it, all right?
I stuck the lady in a guest bedroom.
big guy's cooling his heels in a utility space under the house.
it's kind of like a dungeon.
any idea who we're dealing with?
well, neither one had I. D. He just had some money, this key chain, and some smokes.
she had some kleenex...and this.
nothing like a personal memento to find a soft spot, so I'll take a run at her while you work the big guy.
cause, you know, mike...I got a way with the ladies.
Yes, you do.
Oh, that Marma Duke...he will never learn.
do you like marmaduke?
Oh, I see --the silent treatment.
you know, it's a great anti-interrogation method, as long as you can keep it up for a couple of weeks.
what do you people want?
she speaks.
well, for starters, you can tell me your name, where you're hiding the ledger, and we'll just go from there.
Natalie, I'm a property manager, and I don't know anything about your ledger, okay?
okay. Tell me about your friend.
he's a monster!
and you're just an innocent doe in the woods, is that it?
you wouldn't understand.
I-I have a son...and he needs me.
please let me go.
let me make something very clear to you.
until we get what we want from your friend, you're not going anywhere -
if it takes a day or a month.
so, now that we're on the same page, anything you want to add?
you're totally gonna kill me, aren't you?!
work in the field long enough, you recognize hard targets for interrogation -
people who shut down at the first hint of confrontation.
best way to get them talking?
avoid confrontation as long as possible.
I want to apologize about earlier.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
now, you and I, we --we both want the same thing -- for all of this to just go away.
are you one of Barry's clients?
well, let's just sayI work for a man, a very private man, who has kept some money off-book.
Barry has been taken care of.
regrettable, but necessary.
you understand, mister... - Washington --george Washington.
uh, mr. Washington, uh, your friend is going to, um... crack.
and when she does, you will cease to be useful.
now, I don't want to see that happen.
I still think we can have a friendship.
I've known this woman for three days.
she doesn't even know my name.
ask her what you want.
you'd be surprised what I can do with a little information.
I want to make you an offer of friendship.
you tell me where the ledger is, and you go free.
you don't... well...it's just a matter of time.
if I tell you, your boss will have me killed, like Barry.
but I have an insurance policy.
if I don't show up for the sale, a friend posts it on internet.
a private manlike your boss -- he won't like that.
you have a gun to my head.
I have one to yours.
who shoots first?
I'll get back to you on that one.
everything all right in there?
Oh, yeah --just super.
how'd it go with the boss?
he knows we're in the dark.
he's not gonna crack unless we get more intel.
what did you get out of her?
well, I was reeling her in, and then -- bam! Niagara falls.
she's got more to give, but she's scared, mike --real scared.
nice place.
Oh, don't rub it in.
well, I should get back in there.
sure you don't think you should lay off?
well, she's a delicate flower, but lucky for us, I got a green thumb.
I tailed your cleaner to a park.
he scouted it for an hour.
if I know my arms deals, that's where his deal's going down Friday.
thank you, Fi.
would you stop thanking me? Please?
you have any idea who would pay Strickler for a job like this?
I'm just taking a few pictures.
it's not like I'm doing wet-work or something.
it's not like anyone ever got blackmailed or killed from just a few pictures, right?
have you thought about who Strickler's getting you into bed with?
just leave me alone!
all right. I'm pulling the rip cord here.
we need a whole new approach, mike.
what would you think about using a softer approach?
you're looking to me for "softer"?
you two are desperate.
there's a reason fear often fails as an interrogation technique -
most interrogation subjects are already scared.
scaring them more doesn't help.
what they need is a friend.
I thought you might want some tea.
I'm Kim.
he's cute.
his name is Jared.
look, I know you want to get back to Jared.
we want you to get back to him, but you're gonna have to talk to us.
I-I don't know anything. I'm in real estate, for god's sake.
a lot of people are in real estate.
they don't usually end up in your situation.
I know what it's like to make some mistakes.
how'd you get yourself into this?
I'm a single mom, and times are tough, okay?
so sometimes I take a little extra cash from people and let them use places off-the-books.
you know, like foreign guys who want a condo for their girlfriend.
three days ago, he shows up.
he says that he heard of me, that he'll hurt my son if I don't do what he wanted.
he took my money and my passport, and then he made me drive him around...
used me as his own personal real-estate agent and...
for other things.
son of a bitch.
I'm sorry that it happened to you.
but isn't that all the more reason for you to help us?
we can take him down together.
I have to get to my sister's 'cause that's where I left my son, with her -
honey, the people I'm working for are not letting anyone go unless they get what they want from your boss.
but I don't know anything!
well, maybe you know more thank you think.
tell me about these propertiesyou showed him.
I showed him tons.
I wouldn't even know where to begin.
did he look at any place more than once?
there -- there was a condo.
he said that he needed something near the airport.
a safe in a fireplace.
with its own ventilation system.
time to go shopping.
used in embassies to store secrets, burn safes depend on an internal ignition device to start a fire.
pump in liquid co2, and, if you do it right, you can turn that ignition device into a popsicle.
do it wrong, you turn everything inside the safe to a pile of ash.
no ledger. But...
Natalie Rice. He had her passport, just like she said.
our mystery man --Milovan Dragas.
who have we here?
he must be very important to have made Milovan's burn safe.
how you doing?
good to see you again.
I'm Finley, and I'm told that you goby the name George Washington.
I got to tell you --love the name.
rolls off the tonguea lot easier than Milovan.
I want a cigarette.
mm, your life.
what were you before you became a rich man's errand boy -- a cop?
let's focus on you.
so, by now, you probably figured out that we found your safe house, we cracked your burn safe...
so imagine what's gonna happen when we get our handson Bennett Tash.
you know him?
the fella who's gonna post the ledger on the web?
your "insurance policy"?
good luck finding him in the yellow pages.
I was wrong.
you are an ex-military -- washed up, soft now, but I see it.
okay, that's enough.
now, my boss --he's a reasonable man.
he can make the arrangements to let you go.
you just have to tell me where the ledger is before it's too late.
what were you --a coast guard?
try navy S. E.A. L. Pal.
navy S. E.A. L.S --little girl.
son of a bitch -
pathetic!
how stupid can you be?
not stupid enough to put a loaded gun in your hand.
have a seat.
please.
we got the name of the mysteryman -- Milovan Dragas.
okay, well, that's good, right?
Yeah, well, look, normally what we would do is comb through his bio, create a psych profile, and try and break him in interrogation, but...
the guy was Serbian intelligence.
he's an interrogation specialist.
what does that mean? Like, he's unbreakable or something?
for now, Milovan knows he's in control until we find Tash, the third member of his team.
can you do your thing, see if Tash has a paper trail?
Yeah, whip up some Barry computer magic, see if he Rentedan apartment, ordered a subscription to cat fancy?
I'm on it.
fi and I have to u pdate Strickler on the cleaner job.
you okay alone here for a while?
okay.
cleaner scouted that drive way on the water.
my guess is they exchange crates boat to truck.
it'll be hard doing surveillance out here in the open.
well, you set up for your photo shoot here. I'll be sunbathing over therein a hat.
if there's any trouble, I'll back you up.
sorry to insist on a meet.
I'm not usually this hands-on, but it's our maiden voyage.
I want it to be perfect.
how we doing?
well, there are a couple things you could clear up for me.
I'm here to serve.
how did you know the exact time the hardware would be stolen?
or that the same thieves would sell it to someone else?
gosh, that's need-to-know info that you don't need to know.
and to be honest, it's bad form to ask for that kind of detail.
like it's bad for mto just sit back and take photos while lowlifes waltz away with this stuff.
Fi, please.
you don't have a problem with this?
I'm gonna go.
you guys have much to discuss.
gee, I hope she's not getting cold feet for the operation 'cause I've already made promises to important people on this job.
I'll handle it.
so, does this mean that you found what you're looking for? I can go now?
no, not yet.
we need to find Bennett Tash.
you know who he is?
look, I just showed Milovana bunch of properties.
Kim, just tell me the truth.
you're not gonna let me see Jared again.
you're just --you're stringing me along.
look at me.
you will see your son again.
but you have to work with me to make that happen.
this better be important.
that guy, Bennett Tash, opened bank accounts in over town.
my magic 8 ball says he's stillsome where in the neighborhood, but I don't know.
I'll check it out.
Natalie, you ever take your bossany where in over town?
you did, didn't you?
if we can get Bennett, we can crack Milovan, and you can go free.
but if Milovan finds out that I told you
he controls you with fear. You need to be brave, all right?
tell Jared you'll be home soon.
it's a storefront on poe street.
Hi. It's me.
Jared there?
Hi, sweetie. It's mommy.
so, this is Bennett's place.
what's our approach?
Milovan keeps his business compartmentalized. Nobody knows each other. Let's use that.
Oh, it's the old "we're all in this together"?
I like it.
yeah?
Yeah, the boss sent us. All hell's breaking loose. We got to talk. Now.
boss got pinched. The whole damn network's in trouble. Let us in.
Yeah, yeah. Come on, come on. Come on in. Get off the street.
could be D. E.A, fbi.
he was picked up yesterday.
we've been dark since.
nobody's checked in with me, either.
I had a bad feeling, but, jesus, this is bad.
I need a drink.
in any new situation where you're going in cold, you have to be alert to warning signs...
the sound of mac-10's bolt action, for example.
a mac-10 can fire 50 rounds in a few seconds, but it's one of the least accurate guns in the hands of an amateur.
survive the first burst, and you've got a decent chance.
you know, you could use sometime at the gun range, Bennett.
Where's the ledger?
look, I had instructions to kill any visitor on sight.
look, do me a favor, all right? Just put a bullet in my head.
stay on task. Where's the ledger?
I don't know, man. I just handle the buyer.
the deal's set for 5: 00 this afternoon.
I'm just waiting on a call to see where.
Yeah, nice try.
we know it's your job to post it on the internet if you don't hear from your boss.
we know you have it.
look, you think that psycho would trust anyone with the merchandise?
the only one who knows where that ledger is her.
her"?
her"?
no, I'm talking about the guy, Milovan. He's a foreigner. He talks like this.
the Serbian dude? - Yeah.
he's a fall guy! She threatened his kids. She's a killer.
Hey, tell her I'm dead. You hear me?!
you got to tell her that you killed me!
look, I'm gonna get something to eat. You want something?
come on, Fi.
actually, I think that, uh, something might calm me down a little.
what kind of yogurt did you say you had?
uh, blueberry, vanilla, peach...
uh, peach sounds good.
Fi, call me back.
I know that I shouldn't ask you this, but, um, do you think that you could take the cuffs off?
because i really have to go to the bathroom.
please. I've been holding it for so long.
all right.
yeah? - Barry, has Fiona called?
no, what's up?
if you hear from her, Natalie is the boss. She stole the ledger.
Natalie, the realtor? What?
keep your phone on.
they must have taken the keys with them.
I'll get something to pick the lock.
come on, Fi. Come on, Fi.
Fi, if you get this, call me back.
she's not picking up, Sam.
that's bad, mike. That's real bad.
Vftsh your face, pull yourself together.
like good poker players, spies know it's impossible to hide the tells that come with a bloodstream full of adrenaline.
if showing fear or concern jeopardizes a mission, you replace it with an emotion that won't.
Kim, what the hell do you think you're doing?
you think this is a tea party?! Social hour's over!
Kim! Kim! Please, stop them!
leave her alone! Leave her alone!
Milovan was bluffing.
tash didn't have the ledger.
he was just arranging a time for the sale.
poor bastard never even got the call from Milovan to set the location.
you - - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
listen. She's the one selling the ledger.
we are going to let her go, follow her, and grab it when she tries to make the sale.
I'm so-- I'm sorry. I'm so -
what did you do with tash?
I gave him 12 stem roses and a box of chocolates.
what do you think I did?
I put two in the back of his head.
look, the boss wants to clean this whole mess up, everybody included.
we're gonna move Milovan to the bathroom.
we'll do him there --better drainage.
tell her to take the buick. It's easy to tail.
do you think you can handle your girlfriend?
I promised we'd let her go. I gave her my word.
well, that's sweet.
the faster you kill her, the less time she'll have to be disappointed.
you're a god damnpiece of work.
okay. I'm gonna pull the tape off, and you're gonna scream, and you're gonna keep screaming until we shoot.
now, you make a noise after we shoot, we're gonna have to shoot you for real. You understand?
here we go.
no, no! No, please!
sorry about this, Milovan.
no, no, no! The time for begging has ended.
Hey, you see that? His leg's moving. I think his leg's moving.
wait -no, no! Kim! Please, please, please!
there's a red buick in the driveway.
you take it.
spies don't keep a lot of prisoners.
when you hold someone, you only learn what they tell you.
let them go...And you can learn what they do and where they go.
Kim, what's going on in there? - Go! I'll take care of them.
Kim, open this door!
thank you!
go see your son!
anybody with training can detect a tail from a single car.
we need new transportation.
let's go.
pros watch for anyone who makes the same turns or runs too many yellow lights.
to beat a pro, then, you need a team.
it's best to start a tail midway along your target's route, when they're sure no one's following.
to do that, you need someone down the road to give you a heads-up.
Yeah. She just turned down Sherman way.
nice work, Barry.
Fi, you want to go in for a closer look?
I'm on it.
once you have eyes on the target, it's just a matter of handing off surveillance at regular intervals.
Hey, Mikey!
ain't she grand?
turn it loose, Sam.
hang behind your target too long, and they'll wonder why you're not passing.
best way to avoid their suspicion -- pass them.
she's turning into south pointe park.
what is she waiting for? It's been a half an hour.
Fi, you see anything?
just some street vendors and a few tourists with back hair.
hold on a sec, Michael.
that's the third time I've seen the bike guy.
the guy on the bike just dropped something.
they just exchanged keys.
Fi, what's biker doing behind the palm trees?
beach lockers.
he's got the ledger.
Fi, I'm going after the buyer. Take Natalie.
my pleasure.
don't hurt me! I just
we don't care about you. We just want this.
property of Barry Burkowski
Hello, again.
it's over, Natalie.
you know what? Natalie's just a name on a passport.
whatever your name is, you lose.
boop.
I always tell my buyers to put two things in the trunk -- a duffel full of cash...
and a gun full of bullets.
you were so sweet about Jared, or whatever his name was, 'cause that was just a picture in a key chain.
now, I know that you are not the type to shoot into a crowd of little kids...
but I am.
you leaving without your cash?
you take one step towards me, I'll drop one.
you have my word.
see you around.
count on it.
so... the cops find a car full of dirty cash, and the people who wanted my ledger get shafted for $5 million?
it's beautiful.
Sam called immigration, and Milovan's being deported.
and Natalie? She just vanished?
well, she's smart. She won't be returningany time soon.
well, this clears the tabon all the debts you owe me.
thank you.
you ducked a lot of phone calls.
what are you gonna tell your clients?
your mom hooked me up with a cover story.
I've been purifying in an ashram -- no carbs, no e-mail, no phone.
nice, mom.
Thanks, mrs. Westen.
and, hey, let me know how it works out with my roof-repair guy.
Bye, Barry.
see ya.
Michael, how did that business with the hotel cleaner turn out?
fi and I are finishing that tomorrow.
we couldn't have done it without you, mom.
well, maybe one day you'll tell me what it was really about...
but, um, no need to go into it tonight.
I thought you were gonna go as a sunbather.
Michael, I-I know I said that I would go along with you on this job, but I don't want you to work with Strickler...
not now, not ever.
I can't help you with this.
it's a two-person job. I need you.
I've seen the site.
you can handle yourself.
I'm not worried about that. I'm worried about you.
working with someone like Strickler -- it changes you little by little.
he's the only one who can get me back in.
what do you want me to do?
you do what you have to do.
I understand.
I just can't stay here in miami and watch.
there's no greater luxury in the field than working with a friend you rely on.
when you find someone you can trust absolutely, you want them on every operation you do.
and nothing hurts worse than losing a friend to bullets, politics, or something personal.
but when you have to work alone again, you lock those feelings away and do the job at hand.
because as every spy knows, there's plenty of time to think about what you've lost after the mission is over.
did you shoot these with a tripod?
I mean, look at that photo.
I should put you up for a job with national geographic.
what happened to those men who drove away with the military equipment?
gee, I don't know.
I hope one day they're brought to justice.
these photos --who are they for?
you gonna get hung up on all these details now, Westen?
come on.
it's for you. Happy birthday.
Yeah.
Diego Garza, your favorite intelligence contact.
I just got a call from Washington.
there's been some move menton your burn notice.
any idea how that happened?
surprise to me.
I'll be in touch to set a meeting.
is it me, or is someone on their way back to the promised land?
I get it.
you need to digest.
we'll talk soon.
this is just the beginning, superstar.
I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing -- no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
should we shoot them?
an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.
family, too...
Hey, is that your mom again?
if you're desperate.
someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line -- as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
name's Tom Strickler.
what is it that you do, tom?
a bit like an agent.
Strickler agent to the spies
like I told you before, I'm not interested in your money.
it's all about the burn notice with you, isn't it?
I think I might be able to help with that.
the fact that he's a weasel doesn't give you pause?
it doesn't feel right.
promise me you'll walk away.
Fi, I have to go.
you do this, and you have my word.
the powers that be will review your burn notice.
for you. Happy birthday.
yeah? - Michael.
Diego Michael's agency contact
I just got a call from Washington.
there's been some movement on your burn notice.
this is just the beginning, superstar.
I just can't stay here in Miami and watch.
when you work as a covert operative, there's no line between who you are and what you do.
you are who you need to be for the operation.
it makes you effective.
it keeps things simple.
but when you spend so much time living as someone else, sometimes the people you care about most begin to wonder who you really are.
I'm upstairs, Fi.
what's that you're driving?
it didn't sound like your car outside.
it's a rental.
I sold my car.
Really?
your car didn't exactly have a pink slip.
Oh, the buyer didn't mind.
not at that price.
this, um... this moving-out-of-town thing... if you're trying to make a point -
I'm not trying to make a point, Michael.
I'm trying to make a change.
I'm going home.
I told my mother to expect me.
we had one fight, and you decide to go back to Ireland?
this isn't about one fight, Michael.
if you didn't see this coming, then you weren't paying attention.
you're too worried about your own future...
for there to be one for us.
I'm not doing this for me.
Fiona, I'm out in the cold, and the longer I stay there, the more I endanger everyone in my life.
don't you pretend this is about us. It's about you!
which is fine.
it's -- it's just time I-I did what I need to do, too.
Yeah.
have you seen my h&k U. S.P. Compact, the one with the silver slide?
I need to finish packing, and I think I must have left it here.
Yeah. I, uh... I think I saw it around here somewhere.
I'll find it, and I'll bring it to you, okay?
you're not leaving today, are you?
no.
someone must have made themselves a powerful new friend.
it's not every day the guy running the agency warehouse in Miami gets a call from the deputy director.
so?
your file just landed on his desk.
so, this is being taken seriously.
over my strenuous objection.
but I seem to be the only one who thinks this is a waste of the agency's time.
great. So, uh, will you be the one running my review?
I'm just the liaison.
various regional experts will be doing your review.
they'll get to tear apart the story of poor, misunderstood Michael Westen and put you on the blacklist for good.
you know, if I were you, Diego, I'd start preparing myself for disappointment.
funny.
I was gonna give you the same advice.
I'll be calling you to set up the first meeting soon.
don't you want to wish me luck?
not really.
but I'm supposed to tell you to stay out of trouble.
you're tiptoeing through a minefield.
there's a reason spies try to stay detached.
when you get emotional about something, even if it's just your ex-girlfriend's. 45-caliber handgun, you get distracted.
and getting distracted can be very, very dangerous.
you remember my brother Sean?
you met back in Ireland.
Sean Slenanne Fiona's brother
it's been a while.
last I saw you, you were saving my sister from those English bastards that had her pinned down in Belfast.
spies need to remember every cover I. D.
they've ever worn because you never know when you might need to put one back on.
Yeah. It was a good thing they were such lousy shots.
otherwise, Fiona and i would have been saying our last hail marys together.
glad you're here.
we could use another man who can shoot a gun.
Why's that?
it's bad news, Mcbride.
someone's coming to kill my sister.
this is it? Don't you have any real guns?
I am in the middle of a move.
all of my big toys are packed up on a boat, waiting to be smuggled back.
america's taken its toll, sis.
you've lost your edge and your accent.
O'neill is looking for an Irishwoman.
I'm not gonna hold up a neon sign that says, "here I am! Come blow my head off!
look, I'm way behind, and it sounds like I can't afford to be, so start from the beginning.
his name is Thomas O'neill -- one of those ultraradical bastards -
the kind of man who would blow up a church on a Sunday, kind of man I'd love to kiss with a chain saw.
and why does he want you dead, Fi?
it's a long story.
talk quickly, then.
you don't need a history lesson, Mcbride.
all that matters is O'neill's supposed to be making his move today, and we're not suitably armed.
I'll make a call.
I know someone who delivers.
we'll need some proper hardware.
how quick can they get here?
not quick enough.
is that him?
that's Thomas O'neill.
bloodthirsty hooligan got here faster than I expected.
thomas O'neill bloodthirsty hooligan
we need to move now.
no. I'm gonna teach the son of a bitch how to breathe through the top of his skull.
we're outnumbered. Do the math.
they think Fiona's alone.
we can dig in, surprise them.
no, we can'T. That's a trained extraction team.
we leave now or we die.
there's one on the corner. He didn't see us.
well, he's seen us now.
they came out the back.
she's on foot, and she's not alone.
spread out, sweep the neighborhood.
come on, come on, come on!
we need a car now.
I'll get us one. Stay here.
you never told him!
no, Michael, not even a glenanne would forgive me for working with an American spy.
everyone at home still thinks you're from Kilkenny.
Sean can never know.
don't worry. He won't.
he better not.
Hey, mike. How you - - Sam, we have a situation.
someone's in town trying to kill Fi.
her brother Sean has come into town to protect her, so we need a place to lay low.
Jesus. Okay. Let me make a call.
Thanks, and, Sam?
what have I told you about my time in Ireland?
uh, not much, mike.
well, my name is Michael Mcbride, and you're just gonna have to roll with it.
you must be Sean.
I'm Sam Axe.
okay, Sam.
what's your background?
we're doing background checks now?
mcbride knows me.
well, I don't know you. So, why don't
that's enough, Sean. I trust him. Fiona trusts him. Now so do you.
we good here?
Yeah. It's a new foreclosure.
my real-estate buddy doesn't expect anybody here for at least a month.
better not take that long to get rid of O'neill.
so, why is this guy so hot for you, Fi?
I thought you bit the heads off all your old boyfriends.
I met O'neill while I was looking for the man who killed my sister.
you had a sister?
you never mentioned that before.
I don't like to talk about it.
there were seven of us --five boys, two girls.
Claire was the youngest.
when she was taken, I was angry and I was loud.
O'neill thought I was as radical as he was, and he told meab out a bombing he was planning at a prep school.
and you made sure those explosives never made it to the target.
a few years later, he resurfaced and came after me.
it's one of the reasons that I left home.
after Fi left, O'neill disappeared again.
I hoped he'd blown himself up, but then word got out Fi was in touch with folks in Dublin.
suddenly O'neill's back on the grid and on his way to Miami.
right. Fiona? You and Sean will stay at the house. Sam and I
to hell with that!
with four of us looking, we'll find him much faster.
he knows you and Sean.
McBride, if you think you're dealing with him all by yourself -
we'll discuss the dealing when we do the finding.
but Sam and I are doing the finding.
first, you say run.
now you say hide.
I crossed an ocean to tear a man's limbs off
there's no point in fighting with him.
trust me.
I am not one of your damn clients.
Fiona the client
so, do we love this place or what?
I almost didn't go for it, but then I thought, "I'm worth it.
well, you are, Strickler.
look, uh, my day just got crazy, so...
Oh, no time for a tour, huh?
uh, well, whenever you're ready, it'll be here.
so, uh, you know how this is gonna work, right?
apparently, they're gonna look at my activities when I was regularly employed.
but I get to set the record straight.
Yeah, well, "straightish"might be a better term.
what does that mean?
well, they're delicate issues -- phrases to avoid, phrases to employ.
it needs proper handling.
truth doesn't need handling.
the truth?
Oh, come on.
you are not in the truth business, Michael. You never were.
look, partners have to trust each other, so trust me when I say that right now your reputation is valuable.
people fear you. We can use that.
to make you money.
Michael, did you really think rebuilding a reputation would be free?
money greases palms, opens doors, buys documents, and it puts Michael Westenright back where he wants to be.
now, understand, this project is very delicate, so let's not break it.
I'm gonna send you some paperwork tomorrow -- your side of the story.
study up.
Hey, Mikey.
this is Thomas Oneill's interpol file?
Yeah, you think a guy who crossed an ocean to kill Fi would have a File witha little more meat on its bones.
that's it.
I thought he was supposed to be this one-man, ultraradical splinter group.
well, he's got the reputation, but not the rap sheet.
this looks like he's not tied to anything.
he isn't.
Interpol think she's freelancing.
they like him for about 12 bombings in Europe, all with the same chemical signature, but nobody can pin anything on the guy.
O'neill has some known as sociates in the states. They're money guys.
one of them just bought a condo in south beach.
my bet is it's not a vacation home.
we should get eyes on it.
what are you two doing? Would you put those things away?
mom, wait. Mom.
Hey, come on in.
Boys...this is tiffany.
hi -- Tiffany Ward. Tiffany Ward realty.
mom, are you selling the house?
I was thinking about it.
and with you about to get your old job back and Fi heading home,
I just thought maybe it was about time that I made a change myself.
can we start in the bedrooms?
sure. Yeah, they're in the back.
I raised two boys here.
the way they behaved, it was more like four.
so, I think a large family can live here very comfortably.
this house is just filled with so much love and -- and...
not now, Mikey. We got to go.
I'm just saying, mike, it's okay if your head is spinning.
I mean, first it's your girl, now it's your childhood home.
I never liked that house.
Yeah, but you like Fiona, right?
there's O'neill.
why does it look like the sons of the lucky charms revolution are getting ready for battle?
because he knows Fionais on his tail.
that's her in the sedan.
Aw, crap.
she must have tracked O'neill through his Miami connections.
she went around me!
Mike, she thinks that he's alone.
she has no idea what she's getting into.
it's gonna be world war iii down there.
O'neill is mine.
I'll give you first shot, but when you miss because you broke a nail or dropped your purse,
I'll step in and clean him up for you.
she's not picking up.
Sam, give me the keys to the car.
that's miss Reynold's car.
the keys! Now!
no, don't. Mike.
Hello, gorgeous.
I've been waiting for this.
they knew we were coming.
no.
what the hell?
back inside now!
sorry about the buick, Sam. There was just no other way
Oh, just...don't.
what part of "Sam and I will do the finding" was unclear?
you get on my page now, or someone's getting killed.
no more ignoring your phone. No more running off without
McBride, stop your lecturing. Why do you think we're here?
we came to apologize...and say thanks.
I mean, I'm not thrilled that the bastard's still breathing, but I'm -- I'm glad that we are.
Sam - - oh, please. I've been dodging miss Reynold's calls for an hour.
I'm sure the cops ran the plate son the buick, told her -
Oh, wait. Here we go.
Oh, yeah. That's her - again.
now that we found O'neill, how exactly are we dealing with him?
well, he needs to find you.
he'll want to talk to anyone who could help him with that, which gives me the in I need to get him and his whole team busted by the police.
McBride, you can't just walk right up to him.
as soon as you open your mouth and he hears you're Irish -
I'll approach him as an American with a deal.
Really?
sure you can...pull that off?
I've gone undercover as an American before.
I'll be fine.
I don't know.
your accent's a bit dodgy.
uh, the uninvited could at least have the decency to introduce himself.
my name's unimportant.
you're sitting at the wrong table.
fellas, get him out of here.
I assure you I'm not. This is the planning committee for the glenanne wake, right?
easy.
what are you gonna do -- you gonna play me a song with that?
what's he gonna do?
funny.
I want you to tell me if you recognize this voice.
O'neill should be in the ground.
he and his bloody army were ready for us.
we need to leave town...now.
I own a company.
I'm an arms dealer.
if it goes "boom" or "bang" or helps unhappy people kill each other, I sell it.
miss glenanne works for me.
Yeah, whatever, pal. I couldn't care less about your business.
I want to know how you come to have her voice on tape.
my line of work breeds distrust, which is why I monitor communications.
what did I hear when I listened in on miss glenanne?
an Irishmannamed Thomas O'neill has come with a small army to Miami to kill her.
you got a lot of brass on you, fella.
I'll give you that.
Now...it won't surprise you to learn I can make her appear whenever I want, wherever I choose.
well, Mr. Magic man, if you make her appear now, I'll buy you a mighty fine drink.
I wish it were that simple.
but she's doing a job for me.
if she disappears, I need someone to do what she no longer can.
I was thinking of you.
I don't deal with people I don't know.
you should get to know me.
I don't think I will.
I found her once.
I'll find her again.
well, If that doesn't work out for you, call me.
Slinte.
Slinte.
I thought the Irish were impulsive.
okay, so, where are we if he doesn't go for your proposition?
in need of a backup plan.
well, maybe we should ask Fi.
she might have a perspective that we don't.
that's the real-estate lady!
butch, Sundance, cool it.
Hey, make sure to tell her about the quality craftsmanship in the new sun-room.
you here about the house?
no, I'm here about your son.
can Michael come out and play?
what the hell are you doing here?
exactly what I said I would do -- delivering your study materials.
here it is.
exactly what you're going to tell our friends at the C. I.A.
you want me to say I worked a job helping a Somali warlord?
somali businessman. Yeah.
it's an intelligence asset.
it was a real operation.
lucky for us, all the U. S. Operatives died, so nobody can say you weren't there, lines up perfectly with your time in Africa, and it helps me to set up a little side project I have here in Miami.
what side job?
too early to talk details.
let's focus on the, uh --the businessman.
he's agreed to vouch for your unimpeachable conduct on the job for a price, which I will pay.
no sale.
I'm not clearing my name by getting in bed with a murderer.
stop being so naive.
you're just replacing one lie with another, and this lie washes you clean.
nothing about this is clean.
you need to realize that this isn't about telling the world the truth about Michael Westen.
this is about getting your old job back.
in the end, what does it matter?
Oh, and please tell your mom sorry about the drapes.
they looked better in the catalog, honestly.
you take that. We'll talk later.
yeah?
it's O'neill.
I've had a change of heart.
let's meet.
he didn't say why?
no.
he just said O'neill called him and we needed to be ready.
Fiona, why are you coming home without mcbride?
people are who they are. They don't change just 'cause you want them to.
so, you're still in love with him.
you ready?
of course.
where we headed?
I need O'neill to delivera package for me.
what package?
a little gift with a big prison sentence attached to it. Let's go.
Michael. You know, I-I lost one sister.
I-I can't lose another.
I want to thank you for protecting Fiona.
you're an honest man, and I'm honored to be fighting beside you.
I'm glad you came to your senses.
well, we'll see.
now talk.
it's simple.
I'll give you miss glenanne's location, you get to kill her.
I deliver you the girl, and in return, you deliver a shipment of assault rifles to one of my buyers.
I got a better idea.
fellas?
I'm gonna shoot little bits off you until you tell me where she is.
where do you want it first?
you want your elbow or your bloody kneecap?
I really don't have time for this.
put the gun down, or I'll have you put down.
I'm not sure you've taken stock of the situation.
well, there you go, eh?
you couldn't be trusted, so I brought insurance.
take your hands off me and put the gun down.
gun going down.
very good.
you can follow orders.
now, tell me we have a deal.
if you stop lighting me up like a little Christmas tree, then just maybe we will have a deal, yes.
all right, that's the signal.
turn them off.
Sean, what are you doing?
I can take them all out.
that is not a risk you get to take.
I just agreed to your deal.
simple miscommunication.
Sean, they're gonna kill Mcbride.
no. I can get them all.
Sean, turn the laser off.
this is your last chance, partner, or the deal dies right here.
so do you.
get this thing off me.
that's everything on your list.
time to bring Thomas O'neill's monster to life.
meet O'neill's signature bomb.
he's trotted that thing out12 times and never been caught.
let's make lucky number 13 the one that links him to all his uncredited work.
Fiona, you remember Jack Tracey from the bicycle shopby the church?
just got off the phone with him.
the old guy. He was good to us.
right. Real plugged into the underground.
well, he's got bad news.
there's a rumor that O'neill's taking you home, putting you up for sale.
sounds like there's a number of folks with ample reason to hate Fiona glenanne already showing an interest.
that could be a lot of people.
it seems O'neill's looking to raise his profile back home.
thinks you're his ticket.
I should have force-fed him a bullet when I had the chance.
if you had, you two would behaving this conversation alone.
I could have put them all down, Mcbride.
I had a clear shot.
did you have five clear shots?
I think you're over estimating your ability to hit five moving targets.
you think so? - I know so.
well, how about I -- - how about you shut up?!
we have work to do.
bomb makers, like master chefs, tend to have a signature dish.
if you can duplicate it, you can leave their finger print wherever you want.
some bombs are designed to remove an obstacle, some bombs are designed to be loud and scary, while other bombs are just designed to kill and maim.
rat poison?
it contains an anticoagulant.
he likes his victims to hemorrhage and bleed out.
he wants them to suffer.
he does it for the headlines and the pictures splashedown the front page.
he blows up people just to spread fear.
go.
pick up some screws while you're there.
you two play nice.
you think you can handle that?
guess we'll find out, Mcbride.
Hey, mom. Sorry I missed your calls.
I came by to see if you needed anything.
sure, you did.
that's why you're in here stealing all my screws.
it's all right.
I don't need to know.
let's just pretend that you're helping me clean my garage for my open house.
that sounds good.
so, uh, any other big life changes you want to tell your son about?
what?
I thought you'd be thrilled.
I know you never wanted to come back to this house again.
no, I didn't, but that's me.
you're the one who always insisted that every single memory we had here was a good one.
or did you suddenly change your mind?
maybe I finally decided to move on, Michael.
it's something I learned from my son, no doubt.
anyway...
I didn't want to feel bad about throwing this stuff out without showing it to you first, okay?
I just -- I ran across it when I was showing tiffany around.
my model airplanes.
Yeah. There's another box just like it inside in the closet.
you don't want this stuffany more?
I was hoping that you would, Michael.
this isn't gonna make any sense to you, but, um, most people --normal people
go through their life collecting boxes like this.
I just don't want you to ever look back and regret letting this stuff go.
now, if you're convinced that you never will, I will throw it away for you.
I'll just -- I'll -- I'll take a look.
Oh, well, I'll go get the other box.
well, this is gonna make O'neill look like he's got one hell of an interest in the basement of the state department.
he's gonna have a lot of explaining to do.
that's the noose.
so, you think this slippery Irishman's gonna stick his head in?
if we want to get him busted, we need to put him behind the wheel of this van.
and if he won't do iton his own, we'll haveto just gently encourage him.
McBride, I'll be right there.
right, Sean.
that's the last of what you packed.
it's such a shame to leave so much behind.
I was just getting comfortable.
I know you're trained to walk away from everything in 30 minutes or less, but -
it's not easy for everyone.
I can't believe in a few days I'm gonna wake up back home.
and you'll be you again, Fi.
I wonder what it will be like.
you'll have your friends there and your family.
they don't know me anymore.
you're still the same person.
no, I'm not.
who I am now has so much to do with what I've done here, what I've done with you.
Fi...I...
it's okay, Michael.
we're so not good at this.
McBride, everything taken are of?
Yeah, let's go then.
and, Sean, you have to stop parking your stolen carin the side streets.
it's too exposed.
what?
I left it in the parking lot this morning.
Oh, that's not your to yota a block away, parked behind some trees?
get the girl! Get the girl out of here now!
No! No! He has to live!
you got some good friends, Westen.
Michael, thank god you're okay.
okay, just keep holding the pressure.
I am holding the pressure.
Oh, damn it. I can't get it.
where is she?
Yeah, hey, Mike, sorry about leaving you back there, but, uh, broken ribs weren't a priority.
you were breathing steady.
where is she?
I don't know. I got here, found Sean, called Maddie.
Sean wouldn't let Sam take him to the hospital.
he was saying if we got caught up explaining all this crap to the cops, we'd never Find Fi.
push -- push hard right here.
Yeah, okay. Why won't it stop?
how did O'neill find the safe...
all right, walk the perimeters and keep your radio son channel one.
Hello, sweetheart. This way. That's right. Come on in.
there you go.
stop your nonsense, sweetheart!
there we go.
Where's Fiona?
you tell me where Fiona is now!
I'll call you back.
now, how would I know that?
thomas O'neill stopped one of his men from executing me.
it sounded like he made a deal with someone to keep me alive.
I thought of you.
Bravo.
put that all together yourself, did you?
no point in denying it. You would have figured it out eventually.
you sent Fionato her death.
I sent her home, like she wanted.
what happens after she gets there -- well, she's a big girl.
Strickler, you have no I
Hey, I did this the cleanest way possible.
sure, the brother got clipped, but you were spared.
I'm your goddamn white knight, Michael.
you tell me where -- - hey, hey! Get back.
get the hell back right now.
I'm getting a little sick of your ingratitude.
I'm the one trying to help you out.
you wanted back in?
well, guess what -- a gun-dealing, bomb-making girlfriend wasn't helping your case.
she had to go.
and it was clear you were too attached to do what needed to be done, so, like a good partner, I did it for you.
what the hell are you doing?
you're staying put for the next hour.
by then, the cargo company I hired will have miss glenanne and her fan club in international waters, heroic rescue attempts will be impossible, and you can move on knowing there wasn't a damn thing you could do.
I'll be the bad guy.
you're welcome.
tell me where she is.
get out of my way.
you don't get to have the girl and the job!
she doesn't fit into your future, our future.
so why don't you do yourself afav or and just forget the past?
Fiona is not my past.
Mike, where are you?
Sam, listen to me.
Strickler arranged for O'neill to get out of the U. S. On a cargo ship.
he's been making regular calls to a charter fishing house on key Biscayne.
well, that must be where O'neill has Fi. It's perfect.
those places are secluded. They got private docks.
perfect place to load a prisoneron to our transport boat.
how's Sean?
Ah, he's stable.
I'm coming to get you.
this is the place.
Fi's still here.
you sure?
that's the fishing boat.
let's get that bomb in the bag and get it on the boat and call the coast guard and make sure the feds catch him with it this time.
God, I've waited a long time for this moment.
well, so have I.
in my version, I'm stabbing you in the throat with an ice pick.
is that how you saw it?
I can't say I did, no.
no, it wasn't like that.
but don't worry. You'll soon be spending quite a bit of time with some sharp metal instruments.
you're putting me on the auction block.
you're not man enough to do it yourself.
if this was just about you and me...
I'd be holding a bloody hammer, and you'd be choking on a mouthful of teeth -them little teeth there.
the thing is, it's bigger than us, you see?
when I set foot on Irish soil, it's gonna be a whole new world for me because there are some very powerful men who are gonna give meany thing I want in exchange for you.
you see?
even a seat at the table.
there's no place in Ireland for a bastard like you.
there's always room for a patriot.
you're no patriot.
you're a monster who wraps himself in a cause to justify murdering children!
even your own country wants you dead!
you're wrong!
you hit like a girl.
Sam, if anything happens to me -- - oh, I'm finishing this, brother.
I'm getting fi out of there no matter what.
just don't ever tell her I said that.
O'Neill, get out here.
what the hell's going on?
get to the boat. Get to the boat!
keep him covered!
get to the boat! Start the boat up!
Sam, Fiona's clear. Get them on the boat.
get in the water, you bastards! Go get her! She's gone!
forget her!
no, we need to get to the boat!
Sam, you got eyes on Fi?
I don't see her, Mikey. I'm calling it in.
coast guard.
is this an emergency?
I just saw a group of men with guns loading something onto a boat.
how are they?
better.
they've been asleep for hours.
Michael, I was supposed to have an open house here today.
I'm sorry, mom.
no. I've decided to take the listing off the market.
I don't think it's time for me to leave yet.
if that's what you think is best for you, mom.
it's not just doing what's best for me, Michael.
you hide your clients here.
you let your friends stay here.
I don't think you're ready to say goodbye, either.
maybe you're right.
Michael, get over here.
so, It's Westen now, is it?
it has been for a while.
I owe you an explanation.
back in Ireland, there were a lot of questions about whether or notyou were one of us.
I always thought you were.
now I know I was right.
thank you, Sean.
the problem is O'neill outed you as an American.
you can never go back, and, uh, neither can she.
should I be looking out for anyone?
no. I should be able to keep them at bay.
I'll owe you for that.
the hell you will.
that squares us.
I heard what you did to Strickler.
if you --if you need any help running...
Strickler's body was found next to a certain type of bomb.
our friend O'neill will be charged with his murder and the 12 bombingsin Europe.
that's better than he deserves.
but it'll do.
I wanted to, um... I wanted to...
don't.
it's okay. We're no good at this.
Diego, yeah I thought you forgot.
listen, Michael, what were you doing working with tom Strickler?
Yeah, it's complicated.
do you know the kind of people he was in bed with, the kind of stuff he was involved in?!
Diego, calm down.
Strickler's dead! He was shot to death!
now someone's in town cleaning up the mess he left behind!
I don't know who I can trust, even at the agency!
wait. Who's in town?
I don't know.
but I'm being followed, Michael.
someone's coming for me, and they're coming for you, too.
we're not safe.
we need to meet now.
where are you?
3732 Brighton avenue. Apartment 412.
I'll be right there.
we got a 1-8-7 down here.
we need to set up a perimeter and search the area for suspects.
when you realize that an operation is compromised, that your enemies are on the move, you're on a clock.
you have to move as fast as you can to try to contain the damage and harden your defenses before it's too late.
sometimes you make it in time...
and sometimes you don't.
when you work in intelligence, the worst feeling in the world is knowing nothing, being caught up in something you don't begin to understand...
because it's not the enemy you see that gets you, it's the one you don't.
my name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing.
no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am i? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend.
an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI.
you know spies a bunch of bitchy little girls.
family, too.
Hey, is that your mom again?
if you're desperate.
someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
in a business where motives are questionable and loyalty is skin-deep, declining the wrong request can earn you a trip to the morgue.
so if you're asked to soak in a jacuzzi by a black-ops sociopath who's paranoid about listening devices.
you pick out your favorite trunks and wade in.
come on in, Michael. The water's warm.
hot, hot, hot.
am i being punished? - Not at all.
I just thought we could use a spot Where we could talk freely about our future together.
I like you. You know, like a friend, But you're cute.
but don't interrupt.
my mood's been a bit dodgy Since you failed to steal that file i wanted from the chileans.
see, i wouldn't say i failed as much as your plan failed.
as long as you don't partner me up again, You'll get your file soon enough.
I won't. I've learned the file's been destroyed.
and i confess my first thought Was to kill you and take my leave.
but, no. We must keep calm and carry on.
Thanks.
I think i've sussed out a way To get the information that i need.
I'll leave the details to you this time, But the gist is this
you're to steal flight data for every private plane Flying in and out of miami for the next six weeks.
what are you doing?
me? I'm offering you a job.
you do it, you get paid money, That's all you need to know.
Listen,I don't like prison food.
operations that have to do with flight traffic -- Extremely risky.
I need to know more before i commit.
and i am telling you that simply cannot be.
this is another moment of truth, michael.
do we have a future together or not?
double my fee.
the price of ignorance? - The price of privacy.
fair enough.
can i get out now?
I pushed as hard as i could, sam. He's not talking.
well, to be fair, the guy's a scheming psychopath.
keeping their cards close to the vest is what they do.
you may have to stay in the game longer To find out what he's holding.
I may lose my seat at the table If I don't come up with six weeks' worth of private flight records.
we could try the faa, the dea.
I was thinking the coast guard.
Oh, the navy's little sister,That's a good choice.
how are you gonna get in?
Oh, don't give me that look.
they hire ex-seals all the time for homeland security check-ups.
you could get one of your buddies To hire you on for a temp gig.
you could get in, out, no questions asked.
Oh, Jesus, Mike, But, you know, the thing about buddies Is that they're your buddies.
you can't make them unwitting accomplices to a felony.
do you have an alternative With a lower risk of somebody being killed?
I'm really asking. I don't want to do this any more than you do.
all right, brother, i'll do it. But i'm getting an itchy feeling.
you sure that's from a moral dilemma?
Oh, that's not nice.
dead bolt was cut with a blowtorch.
probably didn't break in to steal your blender.
Hey, pal. Sorry about the mess.
Larry, what the hell are you doing here?
well, it's nice to see you, too, Michael and Sam! I also see you.
seriously, pal, We do 20 missions on 3 continents, And this is how you greet me?
well, that was before you faked your own death ,And came back without a soul.
Ouch. Little harsh, huh?
uh, you do kill people for money, larry.
you know, last time we said goodbye, I was staring at you through a sniper scope.
what made you think i ever wanted to see you again?
come on, now. Don't be like that.
look, i am not here to kill you. he was. I saved your life.
all right, talk.
I'll explain everything after we get rid of this body.
now, i've been looking around this place, Trying to find something to stuff him in
so we can carry him out without spooking your neighbors.
how attached are you to that couch?
would you look at that? Three to the chest.
he didn't even get a shot off.
I just get better with age.
uh, Mikey, that's a santa muerte tattoo.
six tears the guy's a pro with half a dozen kills.
professional killer? That's kind of generous. Six is a promising start, I guess.
Larry, why is a hit man in my apartment?
Well,I think that juan doe here Would have preferred the term "sicario.
a cartel wants me dead?
not exactly -- so far, it's only the guy Who runs their cash-processing center, Carlos.
he sent this fellow, and he wants his money back So he won't have to tell his bosses.
you robbed the colombians?
2 million bucks!
they haul in all this wrinkled-up street cash.
dirty bills -- they got to be cleaned and sorted somewhere.
and then when i heard That these idiots do it all in the same place you used my name to get close.
I'm a burned spy, I'm here to help.
it's a pretty good approach, damn it. I mean, especially with your dossier attached.
okay. I admit, we have a situation.
I tried to close the loop, But Carlos wasn't there when I hit the place.
I killed four guys, and he is angry.
Mike, I'm just gonna say it. There's room for two in that couch.
it's heavy as it is.
always such a softie. I love this kid.
listen, I got the perfect solution.
we feed this body to the sharks, And then you and Ikill Carlos, And I will give you a brand-new identity.
that's your solution -- For Mike to kill a man and go on the run?
honestly, Michael, How do you put up with this guy's constant mothering?
Yes, Sam, that is exactly the plan. And it will work.
Michael, I have a whole new network. Protection, guns, I.D. S.
and you will be safe under my wing.
you really think I'm gonna be your partner?
I'm gonna give you 24 hours To change your mind and get in touch.
after that, i got to think about my own liability.
someone has to clean this up.
you're larry garber now?
Yeah. With the kind of money I make, You can't just leave it laying around the house.
you want to invest, you need an identity.
and there was this shoe salesman up in buffalo,
and he was kind enough To fall on a knife and give me his.
think about it. Call me.
that guy sucks.
Hey, Hey.
Michael, when you asked if you could come over, You did not mention sam.
it's nothing I haven't seen before.
I didn't want to get into details on the phone.
I have a body in the trunk of my car, and larry's back.
Oh, and a cartel wants to kill mike, If you can take larry's word for it,
which, you know, we can't.
damn it, Michael.
the last time he was here, You should have pulled the trigger.
no more bodies until we figure out what I'm up against And we find a place to store the one we've got.
fine. You can use my neighbor's apartment.
the place is tented for termites,They're fumigating next week.
preserving a corpse is not a frequent job requirement for a spy.
but if you must, stashing a body is a lot like storing high explosives.
air, water, and heat are the enemy.
his name is Justino Valverde.
not an organ donor, in case you were feeling guilty.
so far, nobody's called him.
fi and I can track down where he lives and check it out.
probably not a good idea For you to show your face around cartel central.
right. I'll lay low and dig in to his phone.
I guess I got to go by and alert my mom.
Nate, too.
you forgot your brother was coming into town, didn't you?
Westen.
Nate, you're married?
me and ruth pulled the trigger tuesday in vegas.
welcome to the family, new bro!
your brother is so amazing!
we met last month at my blackjack table, And six decks with him, and i was done.
surprise, right?
they just arrived just a little while ago, And I still haven't sunk in.
this is great.
to Nate and Ruby.
God, she's incredible, right? - She is.
I have a problem.
Yeah, well, there's a shocker.
I need you to stay here and watch mom.
are you kidding me? No! No, dude, this is, like, my honeymoon, bro.
you want me to subject Ruth to that right away?
I can appreciate that, but i really need you to keep an eye out. Larry's in town.
dead larry? The assassin?
take this. Don't tell mom. She'll freak out.
I'm freaking out. All right, fine.
but you got to check in ,Often.
thank you. I mean that.
you really know how to kill a buzz, bro.
I have to go, but congratulations! The two of you! Wow!
Michael, don't you da.
so, my cop buddy says this house has gotten some noise complaints recently.
bunch of young guys.
probably sicarios waiting around between hits.
it's sort of like a frat house for cartel soldiers.
it looks like they installed the security cameras themselves.
coax coming from the inside There must be more in the house
so the bosses can keep an eye on these guys.
and somebody forgot to pay the gardener. lucky us.
sometimes, the least-secure parts of a security system are the security cameras themselves.
if leaves obstruct the lens because the landscaping hasn't been maintained, you can approach from a blind spot.
and if you get close enough, borrowing the video feed is as easy as stealing pay-per-view.
this week on "casa de sicario," The killers sleep late and eat cereal for lunch.
Hey, you okay with the first shift here?
I have to go exploit a friend In the name of an unsanctioned national security operation.
and I don't want to be late.
helping Michael with gilroy,Have fun.
Yeah, define fun.
that gilroy bastard better be worth it.
you already got the stuff from the coast guard?
Yeah. And i feel like crap about it.
I'm pimping my seal ink down here, Mike. It's disgusting.
no more favors like this.
and if your job goes sideways and blows back on my friend,
you and me, we're gonna have some problems, pal.
Justino's phone a dry well. Brand-new.
his only calls were his grandma and a Pizza place.
you got here just in time.
we're meeting a mysterious new character. Some kind of boss type. Showed up about five minutes ago.
I don't like him so far.
so, Just met Nate's wife.
there's a Mrs. Nate Westen?
blackjack dealer he just met.
the whole thing seems pretty well thought out.
well, I say good for Nate. good for him, You know, life is short, You got to grab it by the
I should take this. Looks like boss man's texting the dead guy.
is it coded?
kind of. It's in Spanish.
look, if it was in Russian or Farsi, I
what's taking so long?
okay, mystery solved, I guess this is the guy who wants you dead.
Ooh. He called him a Pendejo, That's like idiot, but ruder.
it says to hurry up with you, Get over to finish the job at the hotel Victor.
sounds like larry forgot to mention I'm not the only target.
you look upset.
so, who's Carlos gunning for here?
he's my front man. I hired a guy to drop your name,You'd have done the same thing.
he's a disposable part-time hustler.
you're working with an amateur?
amateur criminal. Professionally, he's a magician, like for kids' parties.
great card tricks. Great smile.
Jack Fleetwood. Real name's Yablonski.
not too bright, Sleeps with the manager here, so he stays for free.
I'm surprised he's still breathing.
well, i was gonna take care of him later.
Oh,you have lived in Miami for how long?
he's calling him a pen, It's sort of like an idiot, but ruder.
and he's saying he is sending some more guys over To clean things up.
Oh, look,Nature's taking its course. We can just relax.
relax? You think I want a police investigation into this? My name is attached.
I told you I could give you a new name,Michael.
why bother saving some poor schmuck?
coming. Nina,
whoa. Michael. Hey, what's going on?
I'm Michael.
okay, two Michaels. What's going on?
we'll explain later, I just need you to get dressed, right now.
Why?
a Colombian drug cartel wants you dead.
they're sending a couple of guys over to kill you.
What?Is this about those latin guys you had me talk to?
didn't I just say I'll explain later?
they're here. - No, no, no, no, no. No more bodies.
you got a better idea?
does this room have a pool view?
I said a better idea!
just climb over there ? it's safe, Just hit the mattress.
if you stay on this floor, they will hunt you down and kill you.
the key to surviving a fall into shallow water is safely displacing your body's mass.
a flat surface floating on top can help absorb and distribute your weight evenly.
miss the target, and you may as well be jumping right onto concrete.
Oh! I think I broke my foot!
crazy, huh?
why would you bring him here?
I want that nut job out of my house!
it's not like he didn't already know your address.
why would that make me feel better?!
if i let him out of my sight, That's when he starts killing everyone.
I really think, uh, it would be better If I kept this elevated on the bed.
forget it, Houdini, That is a Hungarian goose-down duvet.
listen, Michael, I... I apologize about all this cartel stuff.
but can you help me out? Cause I'm really confused.
Jack, you and I have a problem.
this guy, Carlos, you talked to.
he thinks we robbed him of $2 million And killed four of his friends.
so, we need to convince him that somebody else did it, Preferably somebody who's already dead
so the body count doesn't go any higher.
we need to convince carlos this was an inside job.
his own sicario, Justino Valverde, robbed him.
and this is something you're... Hopefully really good at.
we zero out Justino's bank account, Buy some conflicting airline tickets, some clothes
it'll look like this guy stole carlos' money And is about to skip town with the cash.
got it.
he didn't. It's like an illusion.
I'm starting to regret saving his life.
well, he knows too much now.
you can't have the cartel find him.
what's going on?
you guys making some kind of decision?
orchestrating a fake sighting isn't a job that calls for subtlety.
it's not enough to dress an imposter in the right clothes.
am i doing all right?
Oh, you are doing just fine, Justino.
you're kinky,And i like it.
you need to make grand gestures and attract attention to colorful details.
Justino here thinks that his tattoo is sexy. I think it's scary. Who's right?
it's santa muerte.
do it right, and eyewitnesses will be lining up to swear they saw a dead man buying drinks.
drinks are on you, my friend.
this round is on Justino! He just inherited a fortune!
you need to get out of town. Go Vacation in the keys. Go now. And burn the clothes.
every class of criminal has their own set of fears.
usually, the bogeyman lives in the mirror.
thieves triple-lock their doors.
embezzlers check their bank accounts obsessively.
and cartel soldiers get the hell out of any car that won't start right away.
Carlos, I'm Michael Westen. Good to meet you.
what the hell.
you think I have your money? That's all the money i have!
you better kill me now.
you know, you're not the first person to tell me that today.
you think you can rob me, huh? Me?!
I didn't rob you, Carlos! Your boy Justino did.
I never even heard of you ,Until I got wind some cartel lackey wanted me dead!
what? No. This punk, Jack, he told me he told you what Justion said to tell you.
Justino would never betray me.
Really? I think you might have a little too much faith In the bond you share with a mass murderer.
I got a call, Carlos.
your boy Justino was spotted at the iguana bar Down on south beach five hours ago.
since then, nothing.
he's probably gonna blow town.
son of a bitch.
if this don't check out what are you gonna do?You gonna kill me?
find him, Carlos. Do it fast, do it alone.
trust the wrong sicario again, And the next time your car doesn't start you might not be missing a spark plug.
how do you know that you don't want to live there?
you've never even been to Vegas!
you have to at least give it a chance.
I am not some old woman That you can pack away into a retirement village.
you do not get to tell me where to live.
mom, who said anything about a retirement village?
I just want you close by,
someplace where spies and killers Aren't crawling out of the woodwork every other week. Someplace safe.
you know, Vegas is amazing.
the weather is amazing. Someday, you're gonna have grandkids there.
don't you think living near them would just be amazing?
are you gonna smoke that in here?
you want mom to move to Vegas?
I want you on my side on this.
tell her it's too dangerous here,She'll listen.
she never listens to me.
can you at least try?
give her a minute to cool down.
maybe give her a day.
is this your card? 4 of spades.
still no.
Mike, you better look at this.
we have got hundreds Of individually logged flights here.
tail numbers, nav points, clearance codes.
everything you need to create mayhem in the sky for a month.
and Chuck Finley didn't get this stuff -- Sam Axe did.
that's not even the point, We shouldn't be giving this stuff to gilroy.
is this your card?
Oh, for god's sake, man, it's the 3 of clubs.
okay, that's not FI,'cause she went out for food, like, five minutes ago.
Hey. Got to hand it to you, kid, I had my doubts.
what are you talking about?
well, your plan, it worked. I've been following carlos all day long.
come here,Take a look at this.
there hasn't been anything this good on at 10: 00 In a long time.
wow, look at him trashing that place.
Justino's not in that couch, my friend.
come on. Enough! You're not killing him.
you don't get it, do you? Your plan worked!
it's time to dump Justino and this chucklehead On Carlos' front stoop and walk away!
put the knife down, larry.
or what? Your trigger finger has rusted off!
what the hell was that?!
Hey, he warned you.
and, look, there's not gonna be any more blood just as soon as your hand stops dripping.
I am not talking to you, boy scout!
this is my show, larry, and I need him alive.
he's gonna point carlos to the money you stole!
you think I'm giving up 2 million bucks now?
Yeah, i do.
the key to fake surveillance is delivering real boredom.
if someone suffers for the information you're feeding them, they're much more likely to belive it.
can i get one of them chips, man?
what's "no" in Spanish? It's still "no," right?
you didn't tell me we were gonna be here all day.
I'm hungry. Why don't you just go snatch his ass?
Yeah, how'd that work out for you last time, genius?
I told you -- Jack's too protected.
he's had guys watching him Ever since your boys missed him at the hotel.
I don't care. We can't just sit around here all day. We got to act.
showtime, buddy. Just read the script exactly the way I wrote it.
listen, listen.
what's up, tino? - He's talking to Justino.
the boat slip on Grove isle? Yeah, 5:00's good.
I can be there.,Should I bring a bag?
Maricon is talking about his cut.
I mean, if you got it all with you, You got to let me take a look at the whole pile.
I mean, I bet it barely fits in the trunk.
Oh, that's beautiful, amigo.
all right.
when Justino shows up at his meeting, He's gonna be so dead.
Fi, we're on.
if you've been procrastinating, you can't anymore.
we got the money in the trunk. Just waiting on justino.
tell Michael the next time he asks me for a favor, I'm gonna ask him what it is before i say yes.
Fiona, don't shoot. I let myself in.
what the hell are you doing here?
just gonna go out on a limb And guess you've never dressed a corpse before, So i'm here to help.
I'm not interested in
Oh, come on. Let me put it another way.
if this job goes south because you screwed up, Everybody is gonna end up.，Very sad.
here, hand me that shirt.
it's a hell of a lot easier when you stitch 'em in.
your mother must be so proud.
you're gonna pretend that we have nothing in common, huh?
we both have certain capacities and certain appetites, And that is how we connect with Michael.
you don't know the first thing about Michael.
sometimes, you're just what he needs.
and then sometimes, he pushes you away.
uh, do those have cucumber in them? I'm allergic.
well, I have cold cuts in the fridge.
no. I thought i told you.
I'm trying to stay away from protein.
mom, um, I'd like to talk about vegas again.
Oh? What about what I want? Does that matter in this discussion?
I think what Nate's trying to say Is you might feel better.
we all might feel better, maybe, if you were someplace safer.
like 3, 000 miles away safer?
Oh, look! Cucumber salad.
I'm sorry that i'm late and that I can't stay.
Michael, can I talk to you for a minute?
I just had a visit from your old pal, larry.
okay, don't believe everything he says.
he said that you worked together for three years.
that's true, But the government thought we were a good team
after all you saw him do I don't know how you can stay in the same room with him.
I can't be with you right now.
you need help with Carlos, you can ask Sam.
Mikey, it's time to celebrate my genius.
I was going blind Futzing with all that flight data on my laptop.
so i went old school, And i figured out which flight Gilroy's after.
all right, every page is a flight plan.
this is every flight today.
it's like pick-up sticks. It's all criss-cross.
it's a big cluster, And every day is exactly like that except one day.
the 22nd.
somebody needs a wide berth.
Yeah, you get that when it's mandated by the government.
this is some kind of serious black flight, Mike.
and I'll bet you dollars to doughnuts This is what gilroy is interested in, And this is all he's gonna get.
Sam, you're probably right about which flight he's after, But he asked for all of it, every flight.
you think you get to make this call alone?
I'm on the line here. My friend is on the line.
every person on every one of those planes is on the line.
you said it yourself -- he's only after one flight.
right, but what is to stop him From selling the rest to the highest bidder?
we won't let that happen.
you're right. We won't. You want this data, Mike?
you're gonna have to steal it yourself, Cause I'm not gonna give it to you.
and, hey, if that makes me the boy scout That you and your friend larry think i am, Man, I'm okay with that.
no, I am not gonna help you anymore Until you get your head out of your ass.
Hey, you want back-up at your meeting with carlos, Call FI.
4: 45. Justino got here early.
he won't look so peaceful when I'm done with him.
what do you think you're doing?
I'm gonna go pull his fingers off.
I got to talk to this guy, See if the rest of my crew was in on this.
how the hell did you get put in charge of anything?
we're not getting within 100 yards of that guy.
you don't know what kind of backup he has.
what the hell is that doing in my trunk?
I put it there. I'm gonna do him from here.
when we know he's alone, we'll go down there and collect your money.
then you can do whatever you want to his fingers.
hold on, hold on, no, no, no, no. He robbed me, okay.
he killed my men. Give it to me. I get the honors.
don't miss.
you see what you get, pendejo?!
it's all here.
I guess I got to let you off the hook, huh?
so, we're good?
we're great.
large amounts of cash present a huge temptation...
to steal, to kill for, to counterfeit.
there's no security strip, no thread.
are you trying to pull something? Huh?
were you in on this?
that doesn't make any sense.
you run a cash-processing center.
why would I shove monopoly money in your face?
don't be stupid. Put the gun away.
I ain't got to let you call me stupid no more!
Justino must have been trying to screw his partner over!
this is not my fault!
it's your fault i can't have him alive!
I can't ask him where he hid the real money!
I can find the money, and you know it.
you shoot me, it's gone forever.
you got one day to come up with my cash.
you put it in the trunk of a car.
you park it by the airport. You let me know.
you do that, i take off the hit.
if not...
this is Fi. leave a message.
Fi, larry swapped the money.
I don't know where he is or what he's doing. Call me back.
you've reached the voicemail for sam axe.
Larry, what the hell were you thinking?!
Michael, i'm sorry you're upset.
I pulled that last-minute switcheroo For your own good, okay?
we should get together. I need to talk
you meet at my loft in one hour, And if you're not there, if you try to run,
I will find you, and I will kill you!
sorry.
couldn't walk away from 2 million bucks. Not gonna happen.
I need that money.
I'll give you half of it if you do this my way -- Kill carlos.
my head is on the chopping block, larry.
you don't think I'll end you to save myself?
Oh, I know you would. And that is what i love about you, kid.
but I'm not the guy who sent people to end your life.
all you have to do is kill him.
you're at a fork in the road. I know you. This is not a tough call.
killing carlos does not solve my problem!
my name -- it's in the air!
I'll give you a new one. I'll protect you.
you're a shoe salesman from buffalo!
I have connections. I have guns.
and i also have what you need most -- The will.
the will to act on our instincts, To get what we want.
and what I want is to work with you again.
I'll cut t head off the whole cartel If that's what it takes.
but you know what's sad?
I don't see anyone else stepping up to bail you out.
it's do-or-die time, kid.
what's it gonna be?
after a career spent doing bad things for good reasons, it's hard to say exactly where you draw the line.
you might not know exactly.
until someone asks.
I'll kill carlos. You take care of the rest.
Hey, Mike, open up! It's Nate!
there you are.
not a great time.
whatever -- you got me watching out for our mom.
you won't even answer my calls?
what? What do you mean,"what"?
I wanted to see if there was anything else Icould do To help with this larry thing.
I left you, like, three messages.
turning an asset is a multi-step process.
you back them into a corner, you pile on stress, you create tension with the people they trust, and if you can cut them off from good influences so you're the only voice in their ear...
damn it.
they're much more likely to listen.
did larry -- he knows I check for bugs.
he switched out my sim card, Used call forwarding, isolated me.
it's a formula that works so well, it even works on spies who ought to know better.
you really thought no one was answering your calls.
Jesus, bro. Dad's dead. You're not in afghanistan anymore.
I mean, when are you gonna learn There are people you can trust?
Ah, you ever have one of these cuban coffees?
fun to drink, fun to say.
you know, i've been thinking.
if we're going to do this, i want to be thorough, Leave no trace, leave no teeth.
Oh, that's good. That's a bumper sticker. I love that.
forget shooting carlos.
we're gonna blow up his cash room.
we'll take the whole building down With carlos in it.
if it looks enough like a car bomb, The cops will think rival dealers did it.
no, I get it, I just... I'm not sure I buy it.
a new violent plan at the last minute?
what happened to saint Michael?
people don't change overnight.
well, I haven't. That's why I'm pushing it to 3: 00.
it will give me time to clear out As many tenants as possible.
Oh, there's the old softie.
I'm kidding. I'm impressed. I'm impressed.
this is a big step forward.
are we in business or not? 'Cause if we are, I want my money fast. We're gonna have to run.
relax, relax. I can get it really quick. My bags are already packed.
3: 00. Don't be late, larry.
michael Westen back in action. I wouldn't miss it.
Yeah.
I've said I'm sorry before, right?
I'm not sure.
I need help. My plan with carlos fell apart, and I'm scrambling.
I need to find out where larry stashed his money.
well, if I were him, I would keep it close.
but I would want it someplace where you would look guilty If he had to bag out on the job.
can you meet me at the loft?
Sam, we're gonna celebrate your genius.
my punching bag.
you know, he actually laughed When he said,"my bags are packed.
$2 million. It's all there. What's next?
I need to apologize.
I should have listened to both of you.
it's all right, buddy. You were marked for death. It got to you.
I know i let larry get too close.
you let him crawl inside your head and make a nest.
there's a part of me... This part that's like him. But it's just a part.
and it gets smaller the longer I'm with you.
well, tell me you're done with him...forever.
I am I want him gone.
how can I help?
I need you to help me make a very special bomb.
Yeah. How did you decide on the binary liquids?
they're stable, easy to smuggle as separates,
exotic enough so the cops won't know what they're looking at.
it's beautiful, kid. That is just beautiful.
you know what? We are gonna have so much fun.
I don't think we will.
I dropped off carlos' money at the airport this morning.
he called off the hit.
me and Carlos, we're straight. Well, at least, we're gonna be.
you shouldn't have done that, kid.
that is not your money to give away!
what's with the gun, larry?
I let you live, and now you're gonna feed me to the sharks?
you betrayed me,You know I will.
you know what? I don't have to. I'm just gonna leave you here.
you're gonna be a smoldering corpse.
what are you talking about? There's no bomb, larry.
Oh. You framed him, right.
nice. And the binary liquid?
uh, counterfeiting ink.
the laptop is just full of graphics.
and what was carlos doing with a bunch of scans of $20 bills?
probably printing about $2 million worth of fake bills In this dumpster.
you know what? I don't get you, kid.
you don't think his bosses will have him killed in prison?
Carlos made a choice.
he chose to work for the cartel.
I make my own choices!
I don't kill anyone unless I have to!
Yeah, well, we are different that way.
you're not gonna kill me, larry.
not when the cops are coming to talk to larry Garber,
the man who called in a report that he saw men with guns,A dumpster filled with fake cash.
having an identity has its drawbacks, huh, larry?
you forget who you're dealing with here?
I faked my own death once.
sure, but what about larry garber's investments And all of his bank accounts?
they'll sit on that money, and they'll wait for you.
you shoot me, And all that money is as good as gone.
you're at a fork in the road.
go broke and go to jail Or run from the cartel and live to fight another day.
I know you, man,This isn't even a tough call.
there will be another day, michael.
let me do you a favor.
I'll take this and hide it for you.
you're a hero, larry. Larry Garber.
officer! Officer, please, thank you for coming! Thank you!
this way! Right over here in the trunk!
listen, I can't thank you enough. You've been so cool about this.
Jack, remember. You're no longer Jack Fleetwood.
you're Jack Yablonski again, forever.
Yeah. I'm psyched about that.
be safe, man.
and, Jack, seriously, if you ever come back to miami,
or if I ever hear the name fleetwood again, I will kill you myself.
okay? Have a safe trip.
wish we didn't have to take off so soon.
it was wonderful having you.
Ruth, wish you could stay longer.
we do, too, but, you know, work.
one more day, she was gonna file for an annulment. You owe me, bro.
you drive safe. Bye, Ruth.
Bye!
so, you sorry I'm not leaving with them?
mom, I did not say I wanted you to leave.
I said if you wanted to live someplace safer, Closer to them, I'd understand.
well, I'm happy for Nate.
it's time that he settled down and built a life.
but I have mine.
it's here... With you... And Sam and Fiona.
Plus, I can't stand that woman.
weighing operational risk is tricky when your life is on one side of the scale.
withholding flight-plan data may put your life in danger, but you try to remember that if you jeopardized thousands of innocent lives to save your own, you wouldn't want to live with yourself anyway.
you're a tad overdressed for the jacuzzi, don't you think?
is this your card?
it's blatantly not six weeks of flight plans.
just the one that you want.
chile to poland, Tail number 4 whiskey x-ray alpha 803.
registered to a faceless corporation in santiago.
what's so special about the plane?
what happened to the price of privacy?
well, you hired an operative, not a child.
I need to know what's going to poland.
right.
well, I suppose it's only natural to be curious.
I'll tell you. It's a weaponized plague and a vaccine to match.
and they're worth a bloody lot of money.
that wasn't so hard, was it?
you're in, then?
Gilroy, I think you and I have a bright future together.
so, learn anything?
only that he's a damn good liar.
tried to sell me some line about a bioweapon, But it took him a little too long to come up with it.
back to square one, then.
guess you're gonna have to keep doing some digging.
I'm gonna need some help, Sam.
imagine that.
my name is Michael Westen. I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing
no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
should we shoot them?
...an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies - a bunch of bitchy little girls.
...Family, too... Hey, is that your mom again?
...if you're desperate. Someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line - as long as you're burned,
you're not going anywhere.
I don't know why you're willing to meet this Gilroy.
he sounds as bad as the people who burned you.
he's worse.
this man is a freelance psychopath.
I have to say, I find you quite fascinating.
you and I have a lot in common.
what do you say we work together? -Tempting.
the gist is this
you're to steal flight data for every private plane fiying in and out of Miami for the six weeks.
what are you doing?
I'm offering you a job.
you do it, you get paid money.
that's all you need to know.
this is another moment of truth, Michael.
do we have a future together or not?
double my fee.
fair enough.
I may lose my seat at the table，if I don't come up with six weeks' wortn of private flight records.
I was thinking the coast guard.
that's a good choice.
this is every flight today.
every day is exactly like that except one day.
the 22nd.
somebody needs a wide berth.
this is some kind of serious black flight, Mike.
originating in Chile,
fuel stop in Miami, destination - Poland.
this is what Gilroy is interested in.
you're a tad overdressed for the jacuzzi, don't you think?
is this your card?
it's blatantly not six weeks of flight plans.
just the one that you want. I need to know what's going to Poland.
well, I suppose it's only natural to be curious.
it's a weaponized plague and a vaccine to match.
and they're worth a bloody lot of money.
that wasn't so hard, was it?
you're in, then?
Gilroy, I think you and I have a bright future together.
so, learn anything?
only that he's a damn good liar.
when you need to locate a foreign spy office,
it's all about the food.
spies like home cooking just like everyone else.
tip the bartenders and delivery boys well,
and they'll usually tell you
who placed the big orders on the last national holiday.
if some of these orders head to an office with tight security
and scowling workers with short haircuts,
you're in business.
you know, some guys take girls
to the beach, concerts, farmers' markets
ugly Polish military-intelligence offices...
not so much.
believe me, I'd rather be at a farmers' market
than bribing a bureaucrat to tell me what's on a spy plane.
I have an idea.
instead of working with Gilroy the psychopath,
instead of sneaking around trying to figure out
what he wants to steal from this plane,
shoot him and be done with him.
I've considered it.
but somebody hired Gilroy.
if I want to find out what's going on and stop it,
I need him breathing, and you know that as well as I do.
Oh, there he is, right on time.
you sure this guy Konrad is the one to go after?
low on the totem pole at work, short on cash, bad divorce
he's perfect.
we're meeting later today.
Conrad EASY TARGET
how's your polish?
rusty, but his mom's from Moscow.
I approach him as a russian businessman,
buy him a few dinners,
and hopefully we end this quick.
playing on people's loyalties is an art,
especially when those loyalties can be murky and malleable.
poke around too much and you'll look suspicious.
sometimes your best move is just to commit.
thank you so much for meeting me.
it's, uh, better to do business eye-to-eye.
so, what is it you could not discuss on e-mail?
your office has information on covert flights
passing through Miami to Poland.
I need information on a flight.
Why? I own planes.
I'm trying to get contract on this flight.
it would be easier if I knew what was on the plane.
it's a little thing but worth a lot of money to me.
we are countrymen I'm sure we can make a deal
Yeah, please, yeah, let me get briefcase.
I'm sure we can work something out.
of course, commit too hard to the wrong side,
and there's not much wiggle room.
instead of an instant ally...
you've just made an instant enemy.
did you really think you could buy me,
that I would betray my country to you?
you know, I was wondering
why there is extra security at office this week.
easy, Konrad. Relax.
Oh, you sons of bitches cost me everything
my job in Poland, my wife, my family.
over there now.
you're going to tell me everything.
and then I'm going to cut out your lying FSB tongue!
so much for an easy target.
you're seriously going to try To break into konrad's office?
Fi, what else can I do?
I can't approach Konrad's co-workers.
well, what about a better angle on Konrad?
konrad? The guy who wanted to interrogate me at gunpoint?
but we do know that he can't stand the russians.
that's our in.
our in?
are you volunteering?
I confess I am a little curious
about what a psycho like gilroy is so interested in stealing.
probably best to approach as american intelligence.
I'll need cash for this.
deal.
Sam's has a job he's been bugging me to take
fashion house that got robbed.
the lady who runs it needs some help.
the pay is pretty good, apparently.
Yeah, he talked to me about it, too,
but he sounded more interested in the models than the gig.
Sam, you know that job, the fashion gig?
so you're in. Tell me that you're in.
is the money there?
Oh, the money's there, Mikey. This lady is loaded.
I mean, you should see her fashion house.
it's in the viceroy hotel, and she is willing to pay.
all right, Sam, I'm in.
Oh, ho, ho! Thank you, Mike.
thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
this covers christmas, my birthday present.
I'll swing by and pick you up.
when you're conducting surveillance form a dusty cave in afghanistan,
you daydream about air-conditioning, swimming pools, and iced tea.
but spend a little time waiting for a socialite
to hand off her tiny dog to a canine beautician,
and that afghan cave looks a little better.
his usual pedicure, of course the oatmeal shampoo,
and don't forget to rub his belly.
Colonel Peabody just loves when you do that.
who doesn't? You're funny... And cute.
my girlfriend said you were a man of many talents.
you're gonna trust her? You should do your own research.
Sam said something about a job
one of your employees is stealing?
his name is Tim Hastings,
and we've been fighting a lot lately.
now the numbers don't add up, which means that money's disappearing.
and you would like us to find the money.
I need you to be discreet.
we'll keep it quiet.
how much do you charge? Is $30, 000 enough?
that's too much. Please.
this might take a couple of days.
huh. Well...
you won't be disappointed.
sabella Sam's new client
recruiting an asset
is about making your target feel important.
everything from the clothes you wear
to the location of the meeting
should communicate how vital the mission is.
wear the right outfit, pick the right deserted bar,
and your target will be ready to engage
in some good, old-fashioned espionage.
we understand you were approached by the Russians.
are you from the agency?
we have reason to believe
there's a Russian spy targeting your office.
Yes!
he posed as businessman.
we need to figure out who this spy is and what he's after.
of course.
he asked me for information about flight.
this flight is very important.
security at my office has doubled.
Konrad, we need to know.
I can't.
it's not my job to guard this information.
it won't be easy. You'll be taking a risk.
we know how important this is.
we will cover expenses - anything you need.
some assets work for money. Others believe in a cause.
the most effective incentive, though,
is a combination of the two.
all right. Perhaps I can find this information.
but what about this Russian cockroach?
I think we have a file on him.
good.
good news, Michael.
Konrad's...Enthusiastic.
I think we're gonna win the cold war.
he's in? And then some.
thing is, I promised him the cia file
on the russian spy he almost captured.
I think I'm gonna call your mom,
ask her for some pictures of you in your military days.
not my mom - I don't want her involved in this, fi.
Oh, don't worry. I'll take care of it.
you okay there, mikey?
Yeah, I'm fine.
what's up with this easy-money job of yours?
well, bad news.
I had my fingers crossed
that Tim, the thieving vice president,
had a police record,
but he's either clean or careful.
owns a gun, but it's registered.
no parking tickets, even. And yet you're smiling.
well, the fashion house is having a big party later,
and everyone's gonna be in the atrium.
that means one of us can sneak into Tim's office
while the other one keeps an eye on him...At the party.
let me guess which job you'd like.
well, hey, I'm partial to Isabella, models, and Mojitos,
but I play fair.
I figured we'd flip a coin. Call it.
heads. Cheater.
quite a party.
Sam didn't feel like coming?
he's using your access codes to go through Tim's office.
if you're dealing with a trained operative,
there are hundreds of places to hunt for documents.
if you're searching a desk jockey's office,
it's a far shorter list.
before you can say "in the cabinet,"
"behind the bookshelf," or "under the desk,"
you've usually found what you're looking for.
so, which one's Tim? I want to keep an eye on him.
he's standing right over there.
now! Go!
tim suspected thief
act casual.
of course.
let me have a word with you.
who is he talking to now?
that's my business partner, Damon.
he started out designing, and I was modeling.
this company's our baby.
I'm supposed to be at home looking at his designs.
okay.
I really should go. You should go.
go home. Do some work.
I'll call you later with an update.
spies are trained to keep track of multiple conversations
at the same time.
standing alone as you eavesdrop is too obvious.
you need to engage in a cover conversation near your target.
Hi.
who are you wearing?
black suit.
love that dress.
I've never seen anything quite like it.
no one has, darling. It's an Alexander Deschuno.
Oh. I bought...
pure lip-reading takes years to master.
of course.
but confirming what you're hearing by checking lips
is a much easier skill to pick up.
don't get upset at me. She said it.
you know what?
I'm gonna go talk to her right now, cause this is ridiculous.
good. I think that's a good idea.
you must visit my shop in the design district
vintage couture.
I'm talking classics.
that's great.
how's it going over there?
jackpot. Found the books in his office.
sent you a photo. Good.
Tim's heading over to talk to Isabella at her house.
she'll probably want to see that picture.
okay, good. Head over there.
I'll leave Tim's office how I found it - ugly.
you were at the party.
what are you doing, following me? My name's Michael.
I work for Isabella. I think the three of us should have a talk.
I got nothing to say to you.
save it for inside.
we found her financial records in your office.
you were in my office?
that's illegal. I should have you arrested.
it doesn't take long working in combat situations
before you start paying a lot of attention to little things.
things that don't feel right, like an open gate
or a pampered dog running around loose
often lead to much bigger things...
Oh, my god! Isa - Isabella?
Jesus christ. What the...
...like a body floating in a swimming pool.
we have to call an ambulance...
Yeah, it's too late for that.
...or the - the police.
somebody already called them.
of course, knowing something's wrong
and being able to do something about it are two different things.
sometimes the damage is already done.
that's my gun.
what - what the hell is happening?
you've been framed. Somebody set you up.
no, no, don't. Don't touch it.
you have to believe me. I didn't shoot her.
Yeah, obviously. We got to go out the backyard.
the backyard won't work. There's a-a wall.
we'll be trapped.
I vote the backyard.
I told you. We're trapped.
want to head back? Be my guest.
otherwise, step on my hands.
we have to go around and get my car.
if they find it, they'll know I was here.
they'll think
I know you want to chat, Tim, but now is not the time.
grab this. Wrap it around your wrist.
fall. When you do, you'll be pulling me up. Ready?
easy-money gig?
been checking the scanner since you called.
the cops are sending more units to Isabella's house.
they found Tim's car, but they didn't see you.
well, whoever pulled the trigger
must have skipped out right before we got there.
we got to call the cops.
I'm gonna explain everything right now.
you know I'm innocent.
so if we - if we go to the police together,
we can - we can even take a lie-detector test.
how do I know you're innocent?
well, you said you knew I didn't shoot her，back at Isabella's place.
you didn't shoot her.
doesn't mean you weren't involved, Tim.
you had Isabella's books. She knew you were stealing.
no, no, no, no, no. Guys, listen to me, please.
all right, Damon was the one who was stealing, all right?
I was trying to convince Isabella, but he had her fooled.
I - I needed to find proof.
however the hell Damon did it,
there's no evidence in those books.
every large money transfer was authorized by Isabella, all right?
she signed them herself.
I kept telling her. I kept telling her.
she just - she believed everything he said.
you think Damon killed her?
I don't know. Well, if he's behind it, he had help.
Mike, he was at the party the whole time, wasn't he?
Yeah, he had the perfect alibi.
he told me to go to her house.
he, um...Made it sound like she was gonna fire me.
I've been fighting with her.
you know, my car's outside her place.
the cops are probably matching ballistics right now, even without your gun.
he's got you pretty good.
pretty good? It's perfect!
I'm dead! It's over, man!
it's not over.
if it was Damon, someone pulled the trigger for him.
we turn up the heat. Maybe find some evidence.
we punch holes in their stories.
you really think we can do that?
no - while I pay Damon a visit,
you're going to go pay cash for a motel room,
and you're gonna sit tight until we come get you.
I'll drop you in Hialeah.
we got snowed, Mike. We let Isabella down.
she never saw it coming.
whoever killed Isabella sure did their homework.
when dealing with a pathological liar,
don't bother looking for signs of a guilty conscience.
true deceivers enjoy the lie.
they know how to look you dead in the eye
and usually shed a few tears on demand.
so if you want to know when they're lying,
look for the little smile that comes
when deceiving a roomful of people.
Damon stylish bastard
that bastard is giving quite the performance.
he planned this whole thing.
let's see how he does when we mess with his script.
thank you, officers, so much for all the work you're doing.
Damon Belmont, I'm Max, Isabella's max.
we need to talk. excuse me?
we can talk in private... Or in public!
okay, okay, okay, we are on the clock.
we need to reroute all Italy shipments through paris.
ministerial commission's doing some search and seizures.
if you're planning on using laguardia in the spring
whoa, wait a minute, hold on. First thing's first.
who the hell are you?
she kept you in the dark.
Oh, I don't even know where to begin.
uh...this is too big of a conversation
to be having right now.
just suffice it to say I'm Max,
her other business partner... From l. A.
what the hell are you talking about?
I starch heroin into Isabella's fabrics.
production in Asia, distro through Europe.
we're running about $4 million a week,
so we need to improve our communication here!
when you make an approach as a spy,
you need to choose a role
that puts you in the center of the action
and explains why no one's ever heard of you before.
claiming to be a criminal can kill two birds with one stone.
you throw around some names and places and dates to confuse them,
show them some account books to make it sound credible,
and make the dollar figures big enough to play to their greed.
did you say $4 million a week?
now, about the cops sniffing around outside
if this little murder case
leads to a federal narcotics investigation,
my new business partner gets strangled to death
with his designer tie.
the police have this under control.
they already have a suspect - one of our v. P.S.
he and Isabella were fighting all the time.
did they arrest him?
he's missing, but they will find him.
Oh. they better.
or they're gonna have another body to investigate.
I shook the tree. Let's see what falls out.
all right. I'll let you know if Damon heads somewhere fun.
you want to look at old pictures of michael?
well, I realized just the other day
that I hadn't seen that many pictures of Michael's past.
isn't that wild? It's wild.
so, have you, uh, kept any?
sure, collecting dust in the garage.
Where's Michael?
uh, you know, he's - he's helping a friend.
Oh.
but he was hoping that we could borrow an album or two.
so, that's all there is to this?
you and Michael have so much time on your hands
that you want to just sit and look at photos?
Yeah.
every once in a while, you got to take a break.
you hang on. I'll go get them.
they've been in the back for a bit.
couple of photos, we get ears in that conversation
and the cops will have some new suspects.
cover the front. Like a blanket.
t micohockpi up sound vibrations through walls,
allowing you to eavesdrop on conversations.
pair one with a wireless transmitter,
and you have a bugging device
that doesn't need to be in the same room as your target.
we have got a serious problem.
Damon, calm down. What happened to your plan?
we weren't supposed to see each other for months.
we weren't even supposed to call each other.
that's because things have changed.
there's this new guy.
Damon, enough. Stop freaking out.
everything's going to be fine. I promise.
no one's gonna find anything anywhere.
Christ.
what was that?
interference on the speakers.
is your phone on?
no, I didn't bring my phone. I think someone's here.
of course, bugging a room from the outside
makes it impossible to see potential pitfalls.
just as a cellphone reacts
when it's placed too close to your alarm clock,
a roomful of speakers
can create radio-frequency interference
if you're spying on someone with a wireless signal.
you think someone's here?
shut up!
better get out of there, Mikey.
Rick Damon's partner
what happened to your plan?
we weren't supposed to see each other for months.
we weren't even supposed to call each other.
how's Tim?
well, he's keeping his head down.
but he's a bit of a wreck, you know?
he's a boy scout, so he doesn't have a lot of exeprience with type of thing.
we miss anything?
nothing to miss just two guys having an argument.
wonderful. So, checked in with my buddy at the station.
cops are running a full-fledged manhunt for tim.
so, besides his car at the crime scene,
they just found half a box of bullets in his garage.
predictably, perfect match for the rounds that killed isabella.
Damon and his partner have been busy boys.
Yeah, speaking of partner, here's the guy - Rick Pederson.
he's a club deejay.,He runs the shop during the day.
nabbed a couple of times for dealing ecstasy.
had an assault a while back.
let me guess - no paper trail connecting him to Damon or the fashion house?
nothing I can find.
today was probably the last time they meet.
this is two guys covering up a killing.
so they're not exactly itching to break the law again.
well, that is exactly what we need them to do.
law-enforcement cover I. D.S are tricky.
pose as a lead detective, and you'll have unlimited access.
but a single call to the station, and you're caught.
you need to think smaller.
nobody questions the credentials of a lowly crime-scene inveestigator.
Oh! Excuse me.
Oh, you guys are still here?
detective Parks said you guys were done.
Yeah, we were, but, you know, that's how it goes.
you get some detective with a new theory.
and the whole department does a 180.
what are you guys working on now?
just picking up some samples.
look, I can't really get into it.
wait. Please.
Isabella was a dear friend of mine.
well, look, it's not like I get the big picture.
I'm just a lab tech but sounds like they're talking about two guys working together.
what? You didn't hear it from me.
I'll probably be back tomorrow with a whole new assignment.
looks like murder，is in style this season.
who is this?
it's your business partner - max.
you said the investigation was almost over.
you lied to me!
I did not. it was. It is.
then explain why the cops
are crawling around the fashion house.
do I have to burn that place down?
it is not my fault that the cops are idiots, okay?
this is an easy case. They have tim's car.
everybody here knows he did it.
well, I might be able to find out some more.
I'm down in the parking lot. Get out here now.
merry christmas.
my god. What are you doing?
I'm being proactive.
the cops questioned Tim's neighbors, too.
turns out tim has a little girlfriend.
she lives down in Homestead,
and she's going to tell me everything we need to know.
where is Tim hiding?!
I haven't seen him in days.
I swear,We weren't even dating.
he was just helping me with my book.
I already told all of this to the police.
honey, I am not the police.
and you sure as hell don't want me to get upset. Where's tim?
he - he made a deal with some guy at the docks.
they're gonna smuggle tim to the Bahamas.
Where's the dock?
on 64th street. They're leaving at noon tomorrow.
he said something about calling the cops
on some designer who tried to kill isabella.
no, no! Don't shut me in, please! No!
you killed isabella and didn't tell me.
wait a minute. Wait a minute.
listen, there is no evidence that leads back to us.
I don't care what Tim says. I used a partner.
there is no connection to me at all.
it was the perfect crime.
perfect crime? Yes.
except for one little thing
tim got away!
don't worry.
you're gonna just black out in about 15 seconds.
wait a minute,We can get rid of tim.
we can kill him tomorrow.
now that you've found him, we can end this.
we can make it look like he got killed trying to escape the country.
the cops will close the case,This whole thing goes away.
you can pull that off? Oh, yes.
all right, listen up. I'm heading to the everglades.
I'm gonna feed the scream queen to the gators.
you and your partner are gonna follow Tim to his boat.
when he's on board, you put two in the back of his head.
okay, two in the back of his head.
you idiots will be tempted to touch everything.
don't! Just steal all tim's money and leave.
it'll look like he met his ride out of town,
and they robbed him and shot him. Done.
you - you do this right,
and the cops will stop investigating,
and my stylish new business partner, damon gets to live.
you won't regret this.
Oh, boy.
so devious.
he - he infiltrates american defenses and then slips away.
did you track down the flight information?
Oh.
please tell cia file is locked in steel safe at office.
with guard night and day.
whatever is on this flight is a big secret.
it's very, very dangerous.
so it is impossible for Russian to get.
Konrad, I wasn't supposed to tell you this.
one of your co-workers is working for the russians.
there's a mole in your office.
what? You must tell me.
I will find this traitor - no.
not yet.
it'll compromise our operation, and we're running out of time.
if this mole makes his move, if we find out what's in that safe.
no, no, no, this will not happen.
I will find file immediately.
it's tough to get someone to compromise their values
in only a couple of meetings.
the only way to do that is to commpromise a fewcvalues of your owm.
how are you holding up?
I was doing okay.
considering I've been sitting in a motel room for three days,
but let me get this straight.
we're having Damon and his partner try to kill me.
well, they won't actually succeed.
we just need them to get caught by the cops looking guilty.
so we rented you a boat.
you walk in through the parking lot here.
Mike and I are gonna be covering you from the roof here.
when you get to the docks, hide.
the cops come in, get Damon and Rick.
you know, there are a lot of things grieving co-workers do。
but hunting with guns for someone on docks.
mm, not one of them.
but won't the cops arrest me, too?
Yeah, and then you'll have the opening to tell them the truth.
that plus your gun dropped into damon's trunk
is all you need to blow their story apart.
okay.
relax. It's almost over.
there's Tim, Fi. You got him?
Yep.
they're our guys.
time to call the cavalry.
Yes, hello, police. - I'm down on 64th,
and I just saw two guys taking guns out of their trunk.
I - I think they're headed toward the docks.
Yes. Thank - thank you very much.
Uh-oh. They're not exactly heading toward the docks.
and they're not pulling out guns.
Fi, what are they waiting for?
I don't know,Something's wrong.
Mikey, that bench wasn't there this morning.
they moved a bench?
Sam, we got a problem.
guys, they've got a detonator.
they're not planning on shooting tim.
Mike, if we don't do something quick,
tim is gonna be part of a big boom.
I'd say take it out, but more than one shot gives us away.
then I can't miss.
Mikey, do it. He's getting close.
he's still alive.
Fi, pick him up. I'm on it.
get over here! Let's go!
Fi, get out of there. They're closing in.
Freeze! Put your hands behind your head now!
I tried to grab him.
I know. We saw, Fi ,The guy panicked.
there was nothing you could do.
Hey, so, how far are we gonna take this?
are we busting Tim out of prison?
are we letting them get away with killing Isabella?
Damon and Rick just screwed up the plan.
we can use that.
Mike, if that's screwing up the plan,
then how come they got everything they wanted?
from where I'm standing, it looks like they won.
they haven't won until they know that they've won.
Fi, any chance they actually saw Tim get arrested?
no, he went around the corner.
Sam, what's the time frame on the cops announcing the bust?
well, they're taking him in now, processing him.
I don't know ,a couple hours, Max.
then we have a couple of hours.
we drive damon away from rick,get them to turn on each other.
we give the cops another killer.
Max? No, we shouldn't be talking.
what the hell happened down there?
everything is handled. Don't worry.
listen, I'm gonna lay low for a while, so don't call.
everything is handled? Everything is not handled.
what the hell was that?! We talked.
everything's fine. The cops showed up.
there's no way he escaped.
no, he did escape for the second time!
no. That's not possible.
you know, I'm starting to think that he is the only one around here who knows what the hell he'sdoing!
you meet me at your office immediately.
or you're a dead man.
no.
wait. What are you still doing here?
I can't talk to you - police business.
it's okay. We talked the other day, remember?
look, I told you, buddy,
my higher-ups never tell me much.
Oh, there they are now.
Yeah, this is finley.
does Damon know Tim got caught?
uh, I don't think so, but I'm following up on your leads.
looks like that tip you got was a good one.
he's listening in, isn't he?
Yes, sir. I'll be right back down there.
were you listening to my call?
sorry.
I just really want them to find whoever killed isabella.
she was a dear friend of mine.
shouldn't be too long to wrap this up.
it looks like our killer's plan is coming apart at the seams.
no one comes in here.
I said two in the back of the head, Damon.
I tried to follow the plan just like we talked about,
but Rick said using a bomb was safer.
you feel safe now? Tim's probably talking to the feds!
I know. I just found out he called the cops.
what's our next move?
Oh, besides you and I and Rick,who else knows all about this?
no one else , trust me.
okay. That's good, real good.
we just have one little thing to close the loop.
no. Do not kill me!
look, I know we messed up. That was unfortunate.
I have an idea,Of course you do.
we put this on someone else. You tried that.
another someone else
my partner, rick.
he's the one who killed her, anyway. He shot her.
no, Rick will talk. He'll blame you.
he'll take you down, too.
no, no, that gets messy,
and I don't want anything getting back on me.
we could kill him.
no, the cops will just be investigating his murder.
we'll make it look like he killed himself.
now, that's interesting.
how would you do that?
I'll write a suicide note confessing to everything.
I'll even scatter some of isabella's files Around his office.
you can shoot him.
Nope.
I'll get you a gun.
one of the many weapons in the spy arsenal is sabotage.
your enemy can't fight back.
when their vehicles won't drive and their weapons won't fire.
if you're handing a bad guy a gun
and you need it to jam accidentally,
fatiguing the trigger assembly to break under pressure Is probably your best move.
it's undetectable.
so nobody gets suspicious and nobody gets hurt.
here you go.
it was stolen.
serial number has been filed off.
which means it's untraceable?
completely untraceable.
keep the car running.
yeah?
how we looking, Sam?
cops are on their way, mikey.
what the hell are you doing here?
do you remember in the club
when you said everything would go perfectly?
you said everything would go perfectly.
calm down. Everything is fine.
everything is not okay! Tim keeps getting away.
did you want me to get caught?
what are you talking about? Nobody is gonna get caught.
I can't go down for this.
there's no other choice now.
No!
you son of a bitch!
Oh, I hope he's okay.
that's gonna bruise.
police! Stop!
he shot my friend! Arrest him! He's the killer!
well, it took a couple of days of explaining.
and my lawyer's still trying To get his head around the details.
but once Damon confessed, the truth was out.
that's all you needed.
we're selling the fashion house to a label in Milan.
Isabella hosted benefits for a local pet-rescue center.
so we're donating the proceeds to them.
sounds good.
take good care of colonel peabody, will you?
Yeah, I will. Hey, thank you for your help.
Yeah, Fi?
Hi, Michael.
any progress with konrad?
I just got a message from him.
he's bringing me the flight information today.
and your mother's been calling.
I'll head over there now.
Fiona returned the albums.
but some of the pictures are missing
from when you joined the military.
I think someone must have stolen them.
so mysterious. Hmm.
Oh, we'll bring them back, mo.
Michael, I thought we agreed.
that from now on, you'd tell me the truth.
this was a small job.
Fiona had to put together a dossier
to prove that I was a - a russian spy.
just a small job.
it's kind of a long story,Which I'll tell.
it wasn't anything dangerous.
look, the last time you and I went through this, it was hard.
I - I just don't like seeing you get hurt.
so, what, you kept me in the dark to protect me?
you know how it goes.
these things aren't so predictable.
well, she left one behind because it was special to you.
no, it's probably 'cause there's
uh, there's writing on the back.
Oh, It was special to me.
it's one of the few times you ever sent me anything
to tell me where you were.
well, actually, I had already left the country.
I wrote that so that you didn't know where I was.
Oh.
well, then , um, grand scheme of things.
I - I suppose we're making some progress.
you - you want some iced tea? That'd be great.
this information russian spy is after is much worse than I though.
you found out what's on that flight.
not what, it's who.
who's on the flight?
there's no names, but he is maximum-security prisoner.
this document is instruction on how to deal with him.
I'd translate it for you, but...
if Russian pig gets his hands on this envelope.
he'll never get it, my friend.
thank you, Konrad.
we were right. It's bad.
it's a rendition to a black site in Poland.
somebody's high-risk enough to be flown alone.
do not engage in conversation with prisoner
under any circumstance.
sounds like a sweetheart.
this kind of treatment is reserved.
for world-class bad guys, Michael.
I know, and somebody wants my help to break him out.
I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing -- no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am i? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend... - Should we shoot them?
...an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.
...family, too... - Hey, is that your mom again?
...if you're desperate. - Someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line -- as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
Mike, I'm telling you, don't do it.
what? You don't like the belt?
I'm not kidding around here. You got to put a kibosh on this.
Sam, we talked about this. - Well, maybe we didn't talk about it enough.
you're working for the same sons of bitches that burned you, Mike, - and now you're gonna meet with this Vince guy. - Vaughn.
Vaughn -- good name for a vampire.
I'm just saying, i don't think you thought this through.
I don't love working with him, but what we're doing is important.
why, 'cause Simon got out?'
okay, he was a bad guy.
okay, a very bad guy.
but he's stuck in a dungeon somewhere. Problem solved.
if it was just about Simon, maybe, but the guy who helped him escape has bigger plans.
I know you feel this is on your shoulders, but it's not your job to solve everything. Just walk away.
I got an innocent man burned for looking into this.
if I stop now, I'll have ruined Jesse Porter's life for nothing.
okay, fine.
but I still think Vaughn is a vampire name.
Hey, pal.
you're looking well.
Miami sunshine is working wonders for you.
well, I get a little pasty when my pals lock me in a secret prison.
so, how's our project coming?
slowly. I've been looking through Jesse Porter's files.
it's a few thousand pages of raw intelligence.
Yeah.
we should talk about Jesse Porter.
what about him? - FBI picked him up, then released him.
they decided it was better to let him go and keep the incident quiet.
he's been laying low, making calls to people around the government to figure out who stole his files.
he's looking for who burned him.
don't worry.
we're gonna have him taken care of.
taken care of? - Look, it's nothing lethal.
we're just gonna find him and put him on a plane to a nice, remote holding facility.
Vaughn, that's a mistake. It's more efficient to use him as a resource.
so, you sure you're not feeling sentimental just 'cause you burned him?
no, everything we need is inside Jesse's head.
you put me in charge of the investigation.
let me handle Jesse.
phone records.
allied financial services?
Yeah, Jesse hacked their pbx switch.
he's using it to make his calls.
bug it, boss.
that should set you on the way to locating him.
just curious -- have you thought at all about what you're gonna say to Jesse when you find him?
Hi. I'm Michael. I destroyed your life.
I'll try to avoid that subject.
has it occurred to you that avoiding Jesse might be a good idea?
you've toyed with him enough.
I'll do everything i can to help him, Fi.
first i got to find him.
well, I guess a little Sunday break-in never hurt anyone.
we got 90 seconds.
you'd be surprised what i can do in 90 seconds.
housed in office utility rooms, a pbx is the phone switchboard for a whole company.
using a router with upgraded firmware, pros can hack them to make untraceable calls from the comfort of their own homes.
it's how spies get free long-distance.
identifying the right line to bug on a pbx is as simple as matching call times from your records to those in the computer.
of course, if you have to comb through thousands of phone calls, it's easier said than done.
everyone knows spies are good with languages and firearms, but they need to be great storytellers, too.
if you can't keep a break-in secret, you have to get creative to cover your tracks.
if a company's just laid off half its staff, no one asks many questions when it looks like an ex-employee broke in to make a mess.
taking your sweet time, Michael.
you need to buy us some more time, Fi.
that's our cue to leave, Michael.
what took you so long?
I thought you were gonna buy us more time.
I knew you were gonna say that.
how was that?
very good.
anybody home?
mom?
mom!
Jesus.
okay, we both get a text -- "need help now. need help now."
and you don't answer your phone?
we thought you were under siege.
well, I'm sorry. I'm not up on texting etiquette.
I'm -- I'm converting the garage to a rental, and i thought you boys could lend a hand.
you're taking on a renter?
I am. I already have him lined up.
he has a cat, and he's very nice.
do you think this is a good idea?
I do.
I could use the extra money and a little company.
uh, mom, we use the garage for work, for, um... - Private.
...private work. - You mean building bombs and interrogating people?
when you were on vacation in prison, Michael, I realized something.
I could use more stable people in my life, not people who sleep with guns under their pillows.
all right, mom.
what do you need done?
I promised i'd tile the garage before he moves in.
you know, I'm a little hurt, maddy.
you never spruced the place up when i was here.
that's because he's a paying renter, Sam, not someone who detonates explosives in my solarium.
you know, mike, some guys listen to a thing called music while they work.
it's sort of like talking, only with, you know, instruments.
well, that tap on Jesse's phone line is our only lead on his location.
And?
well, I was just thinking, you know, these are the guys who interrogate spies.
their job is seeing through people like you -- like us.
I know it's risky, Sam, but right now it's the only way -- hey, It's Jesse Porter.
you shouldn't call me at home. You're radioactive.
I get caught talking to you, i lose my pension.
look, I'm not dirty. Somebody set me up.
you got to believe me, Freddy.
I know. I made a few calls, got my hands on something you need to see.
okay, well, what is it? Do you know who -- this line's not secure.
we need to meet in person -- today.
all right, the park near my place -- ocean and Lexington -- 4: 00.
well, sounds like Jesse might have a lead on the person who burned him.
look on the bright side. We have his location.
I'm calling Fi.
okay, for the record, I already hate everything about this.
how's it looking, Sam?
same as an hour ago -- all quiet on the western front.
Mike, i'm projectile sweating down here.
I'm turning my new Hawaiian into a dishrag, and, you know, we're talking about a poly-silk blend here
dry-clean only, and it's ruined.
okay, Sam. You can bill me.
damn straight.
you know, i feel for Jesse, alone, hauled out, sealed off like toxic waste.
I do too, Fi. Trust me, i know what he's going through.
except Jesse didn't wake up next to someone who had his back, like you did.
as I recall, I woke up because somebody kicked me.
the point is you have a team.
that team may include a washed-up, old boozehound.
you're on speaker, Fi.
you know what i mean.
Yeah, whatever. - Here comes Jesse.
he is a strapping fellow, isn't he?
Hey, Fred.
Oh, and that must be Jesse's mystery date.
thanks for coming, man.
got two S. U.V. S, blacked-out windows.
something tells me they're not with the neighborhood watch.
how you been? You okay?
Jesse, I'm sorry.
what are you gonna do, right?
okay, that's a trap.
Mikey, this is not good.
they're gonna have him hemmed in. We got to warn Jesse.
we can't let him see us.
if he knows we're watching him -- here.
we can't sit on our hands while he gets ambushed.
he won't. He can get away.
just hang on, Fi. Fi, hang on.
he made me call you.
what the hell are you talking about, Freddy? Who? Who made you?
he had pictures of me, threatened to go to my wife.
I'm retired. My marriage is all i got left.
Freddy, what the hell are you talking about? What'd you do?
Sam, the bike locked to the pole behind you -- pull the chain off the gears.
okay, mike, tell me what you got, and make it snappy.
you think that old arm of yours can hit the power lines?
are you kidding?
this bazooka took Annalee High to the Michigan state quarterfinals.
wrap a metal chain around two power lines, and you complete a very powerful electrical circuit.
it can get you arrested, but it's a good way to make a ruckus in a pinch.
go, go, go!
you sold me out to Khan.
I didn't have a choice.
you're lucky this guy can handle himself.
well, he's lucky they had tasers, not guns.
I guess we're not the only ones looking for Jesse.
we better find him first, Michael.
I drove around his neighborhood for hours. He didn't come back.
cops found a body a mile from the park.
Jesse's contact?
well, I guess he wasn't worth much after the setup.
so, who the hell were the guys in the S. U.V. S?
I don't know.
give me good news. You find Jesse?
I did -- about a minute before he was ambushed by some amateur extraction team.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I asked for good news.
Jesse got away.
do you know if he has any old enemies in town?
what am i, Jesse's biographer? I'm calling you for information.
I need you to use some of your resources.
find out -- you're my resource on this.
you wanted to handle this?
handle it.
like engineers and wedding planners, spies obsess over details.
if you always keep a lock with the logo facing in and suddenly you find it turned out, you've got a problem.
when you know someone's about to get the drop on you, you can play it safe and walk away, or you can pretend nothing's wrong, go about your business, and get the drop on them.
nightclub's closed on Mondays, but i'm guessing you're not here to salsa dance.
you must be Michael Westen. I heard you were good.
right now i'm just a guy pointing a gun at your head.
who are you?
my name is Jesse Porter.
I've got a problem that only you can understand.
and, uh, i need your help.
it's like meeting a character out of a book
michael Westen, the burned spy.
people still talk, you know.
there's the he-was-done-wrong folks, and then there's the they-should've-shot-him folks.
which side were you on?
never mind.
what brings you here?
I was counterintelligence. Someone stole my files. I got blamed for the breach.
eight years -- eight years, they just booted me out like it was nothing.
I'm sorry.
for what it's worth, I know how you feel.
Yeah, well...that's actually not my biggest problem right now.
I got an old enemy coming after me.
I figured you must have a friend in the government.
I mean, how else could you have survived this long? I just need to talk to someone.
I have friends, but not in the government.
your name doesn't even need to come up. I-I just -- I
I can't help you there.
all right.
thanks for the yogurt.
this old enemy -- does he have a name?
Yeah, Ming khan.
son of a bitch thinks i stole 2 million bucks from him.
maybe I could help you there.
no, man, look, he's -- you don't know him. He's dangerous. He's connected.
I said I had friends.
let me see what I can do for you.
why would you do that?
part of me thinks that burned spies need to stick together.
yeah? What about the other part?
the other part thinks if a counterintel op owed me a favor and got back in someday, he could put in a good word for me.
all right, man.
you got a deal.
you know of any good motels, man? I, uh -- I can't go back to my place.
uh, you can't go to a motel right now. That's exactly where khan will be looking for you.
Yeah.
we'll figure something out.
so I'm in charge of keeping secrets from a counterintelligence agent?
he's crashing in a vacant condo next door.
it's not like he's staying in your living room.
but he is using my duvet.
if another one of your strays ruins my linens, I will kill you.
you said yourself Jesse needs someone to watch his back.
that is not fair using that argument against me.
fine.
there are worse things than having a very cute next-door neighbor.
in exchange for this downy-soft bedding, you've got to tell us all about this khan person.
m-most of it's classified, so I-I can't really
let's be clear. Michael is the spy.
he cares about words like "classified."
I, on the other hand, only care about who it is i'm supposed to be fighting.
okay. Khan was a hotshot in Asian drug shipping, got in some trouble with the local authorities, came running to uncle Sam to cut a deal.
he's a snitch, basically.
he's trading intel on his terrorist pals for a life in America.
you were his handler.
Yeah, got the job of debriefing him, moving his money to U. S. Banks.
first part went fine. Money never showed up.
the Chinese got it in transit. Poof.
and he blames you for stealing his nest egg.
Yeah, not to be crass, but have you considered shooting him?
I'd be all for it, but khan's got some powerful friends. If i take a shot at him, they'll come after me next.
that's why I wanted to find someone in the government to shut it down.
Yeah, that's not gonna happen, but we may be able to do the next best thing.
you know, if we can get him busted by the cops, his friends will keep their distance.
Illegal-weapons charges might do it.
it'll be tough, but if we keep it really heavy -- 25mm, maybe an - rpg... - Rpg.
Rpg? Right.
Oh, you're serious?
so -- so you have, like, a magic way of -- of setting him up for this?
no magic -- we get him to buy the weapons. We get him arrested.
you're gonna walk up to the guy, start talking to him?
I'm a spy, Jesse. That's what we do.
have things changed since i've been out?
uh, Khan is a psycho, just so you know. I seriously doubt y'all have mutual friends.
a mutual enemy will do fine.
there, uh, can i talk to your boss?
get the hell
quick and excruciating, few holds are more effective than a simple thumb lock.
a little pressure on the right spot...
...and your target will be learning how to hold a fork with a new hand.
he might want to ice that.
Hey, we need to talk.
and who might you be?
the name's Turner.
we have a mutual acquaintance, Jesse Porter.
doesn't ring a bell. Does it, Mr. Lei?
so it was someone else who ran that half-assed snatch-and-grab yesterday?
you know, I was this close to laying my hands on that son of a bitch, until you guys blew it for me.
how did you find us?
there's only so many groups of guys carrying serious heat in Chinese restaurants in key Biscayne.
so, what do you want?
well, I want to make a deal.
why would we make a deal with you, Mr. Turner?
because I know where Jesse is
unless you guys have never heard of him, and then i'll just finish up here and...
take my Mongolian beef to go.
what is it that you want with, uh, Jesse?
there's a certain cartel willing to pay top dollar to me for what's in his head.
I think there's a way we can help each other.
I'm listening.
your little fiasco with Jesse sent him into hiding.
he's dug in like a tick -- cement wall, claymore mine in the door.
and you'll tell me where this is on what condition?
I need some heavy artillery to extract him.
I'm low on funds.
I could use a few extra hands.
so, when we find Jesse, we're supposed to just, what, share him?
that's what we learned in kindergarten.
I mean, you get what you need, and then i take him with me -- win-win.
we will find him on our own, thank you.
we don't go on armed assaults with randoms off the street.
okay, okay. But -- good day, Mr. Turner.
can I take the mongolian beef?
I told you a sales pitch isn't gonna do it. Khan -- khan's tempted.
we just need to push him a little bit harder.
right now, they think they can handle you on their own.
but we'll convince them they need help -- my help.
how do you propose to do that?
there's someone i want you to meet.
Jesse, this is Sam Axe. He's a former navy S. E.A. L. And a friend.
good to meet you.
likewise.
so, Mike told me about your problem.
I had a buddy pull some paperwork. Turns out Mr. Lei rents a place on star island.
so, here's what i'm thinking.
next time these guys head out for grub, we stage a mock ambush on them.
Jesse, if you can position yourself on the outside wall here, you can hose the place down with your assault rifle, do a triangle-of-death thing, drive them into here.
Michael: when you stop to reload, i'll swoop in, scare you off, and i become Khan's guardian angel.
okay, let me see this.
I dig it. I dig it.
just, if we're gonna do the triangle of death, we got to do it from inside the wall, like, right here, like, in his face.
there's an armed guard that patrols the grounds, Jesse.
if you get any closer than that
I'll have to deal with a rent-a-thug all by my little self.
okay, uh, quick F. Y.I. Here
uh, we plan our missions with the wacky idea of getting everybody out in one piece.
so just sit back, relax, and let us worry about the heavy lifting.
so, Mike, you think this is gonna convince Khan to work with you, or just that he should pack up and leave?
well, he thinks Jesse's got his money.
he'll do what he has to do to get it.
just cover me when i go in.
did I mention i'm not a fan of running a mission with a kid we barely know?
10 times.- I'm just saying, these counterintel types, Mike
they're lone wolves, they are not team players.
this is Jesse's best shot to getting Khan off his back. He'll behave.
here we go, Sam.
okay, that's where Jesse's supposed to set up shop.
and yet he's still moving.
what the hell is he doing?
his version of the plan.
watch my back.
Hey, Khan!
you looking for me?!
you want your money? Come get it!
like pro athletes, spies know that no amount of practice or planning simulates the adrenaline rush of real action.
that's why you always have to be ready to adjust tactics on the fly.
if a teammate suddenly decides to shoot at you to convince the bad guys you're enemies...
...you go with the flow...
and shoot back.
unbelievable.
are you guys trying to die?
Mr. Turner. - At your service.
Oh, come on, Mike, I can't take out four jokers in one go.
is this your way of thanking me for saving your hides?
you have a bad habit of showing up where you don't belong.
are you guys impaired?
am I talking too fast? Is that it?
I mean, I'm trying to get Jesse.
it doesn't take a genius to figure out that he'd try to hit your place after you went after him.
you still think you can handle Jesse?
fine, kill me.
but the next time he pays you a visit, you're gonna need more than new lawn art.
whether it's in the field or a showroom, the most powerful move at the end of a sales pitch is to just walk away.
it's an effective technique to close a deal, but it can also get you shot in the back.
you have a flair for the dramatic, Mr. Turner.
you've made your point.
is that your way of saying you'd like my help catching Jesse?
I'll be back tomorrow with a shopping list.
crack your piggy bank. It's gonna cost you.
Oh, and, khan... Tell your sidekick his safety's on.
Oh, yeah. Sorry about the car.
hope you'll take a personal I. O.U? Good as gold.
what the hell did you think you were doing back there?
kicking ass.
what? I had to get in close to sell it. I got it done.
no, no, we got it done.
you pull that lone ranger crap again, you and me are gonna dance.
Really? - Yeah - We're gonna dance? - we're dancing.
I will beat your old ass. - Come on, man, pull the trigger.
Oh, you think? - You're just an old man. Do it. Do it.
calm down. Calm down!
what matters is that i'm in with Khan and Lei.
you want to finish this when i'm done, fine. We have work to do.
okay by me, Mikey.
sooner we put them on a platter for the cops, sooner we're done with billy the kid here.
all right, so you got the meeting with Khan. What happens if they smell a setup?
we'll cross that bridge later.
for now, I need them to buy enough artillery to start World War III.
Michael: I don't know what level of experience you have with this sort of thing, but the trick with a bunker -- It's not about getting in, it's about getting the target out alive.
well, I need him alive.
right, so this is what i propose.
now, I can arrange delivery -- three Barrett rifles, tungsten-tipped rounds?
designed to punch holes in tanks.
it'll cut through that bunker like it's made of tissue paper.
a breaching ram, military-grade tear gas, and a grenade launcher?
Hey, we pump in some gas, flush out Jesse like the rat he is.
this is not even legal.
this kind of firepower is way too risky.
too risky?
you know, I spent...
15 years in special ops, interrogating, tracking, climbing into caves in Afghanistan.
you ever done that?
Yeah, I didn't think so.
I know what it takes to get it done.
I say we find Jesse on our own, take care of him our own way.
you know, your boy here is awfully opinionated.
last time I checked, though, Jesse's hunting you.
he makes a point.
I been hunting agent Porter for a long time.
I know what makes him tick.
I know what it takes to get what you want from him, but I need the right tools to grab him.
if you have the cash, I can get a guy who can get everything we need.
now, I'm tired of Mr. Lei second-guessing everything i say.
if we have a deal, you say so. Otherwise, I go my own way.
provide an account where you'd like your money wired, Mr. Turner.
we will make the arrangements.
Fi, Khan went for it.
let's get a truck ready.
make it look like i'm a guy who moves a lot of heavy weapons.
any preference on color?
I'll leave it to you, but i need it by tomorrow morning.
I got to head to my mom's.
her renter's cat found some of my old detonators.
Bye-bye, tenant.
Yeah, he moved out. Can you and Jesse handle the truck?
I'm sure we'll be fine.
when using a street vehicle to haul serious weapons, some modifications are in order.
heavy-duty coil springs are used by dune buggies to race across the desert.
add them to your suspension system, and you can hit a few potholes without snapping an axle.
a strut brace over your engine stabilizes your center of gravity.
and nothing helps with a fast getaway like a nitrous-oxide tank connected to your fuel injector.
all righty.
think that's everything Westen needs for his gun deal with Khan?
if Michael can't make an escape in this, then he deserves to get caught.
you're pretty handy with that wrench.
you're pretty handy with a gun for a desk jockey.
michael told me about your little one-man rampage at Khan's.
I actually started in the field.
they stuck me in counterintel 'cause i tended to, uh, go after all the bad guys, not just the ones they wanted me to get.
it turns out some guys can watch a dude smack his girlfriend around in a bar, and some guys can't.
I knew I liked you.
Michael's gonna be a while. You, uh...want to take it for a spin?
hell yes.
who says Christmas only happens once a year?
Barretts are in the bag. Here are your launchers.
turn that frown upside-down. Are we happy?
we are.
the rest of your money is on its way now.
so, when do we find Jesse?
I'm gonna take you to him. Let's mount up. Just give me a hand with the ammo.
spies know the most distrusting people are often the easiest to manipulate.
if you want someone to drive around with a trunk full of illegal weapons, just insist on doing it yourself.
what the hell do you think you're doing?
um, putting the guns in.
I mean, this truck has been specially outfitted for the weight.
no way.
you think we're gonna spend that kind of money and just let you drive off with them?
I'm not driving off with anything.
I'm meeting you at the bunker.
and we're just supposed to trust you, right?
we take the weapons.
you know, with all due respect, Mr. Khan, are you out of your frickin' mind?
you know how illegal these guns are.
your fender's gonna be dragging on the pavement.
some port authority stooge is gonna call the cops.
right now, i'm more worried about you than the cops.
suit yourself.
lift with the knees.
Yeah. Hi, police?
um, I think I just saw a drug deal.
Yeah, guys with guns loading bags.
hyperion road, by the port.
take the next left. Two blocks.
damn, what did I tell you?
if you find yourself in a high-speed pursuit while driving in a caravan, you don't always have to be faster than the cops.
you just have to be faster than the guy next to you.
of course, it helps if you are faster than the cops.
hands on your head!
hands on your head!
get up! Get up! Get up!
get in there! stand up.
officer, let -- let us explain.
you have the right to remain silent.
you worried about the cops now?
Jesse, it's Michael again.
where are you? Call me back.
four messages?
don't you think you might seem a little desperate?
he took us out for a $100 thank-you dinner last night, and now he won't return my calls?
relax.
all his stuff is still at the condo.
I don't think Jesse's the type to leave without saying goodbye.
he's not you.
it's Khan.
shouldn't he be in jail?
let's find out.
Khan.
Oh, I thought you got pinched. - Yes.
years ago, I did a favor for the people at the drug enforcement agency.
it wasn't easy, but my lawyers persuaded them to return that courtesy.
Oh, you were sitting on a get-out-of-jail-free card? Oh, that's beautiful.
listen, give me another day.
we'll take another run at it.
Oh, that won't be necessary.
you see, Jesse stuck his head out when he thought i was gone.
he was unaware i kept his apartment under surveillance.
you got Jesse?
picked him up two hours ago.
we've been trying to get him to talk, but so far he has been uncooperative.
you know, you said you knew all about Jesse and the art of interrogation.
perhaps you could come talk to him.
Oh, It' ll be my pleasure.
Yeah, you remember our deal, though.
you get what you're after, and then i get Jesse.
that only works if he's in one piece.
I'll try not to do any permanent damage.
at least the cops seized Khan's heavy artillery.
five of them, three of us -- it's almost a fair fight.
but we can't solve this with guns, Fi.
it's too easy for them to just kill Jesse if things get hot.
well, do you have a better idea?
Yeah, we need to convince Khan to let me take Jesse.
wait, did you hit your head during the car chase?
khan is not gonna let you take Jesse until he gets his money, which is a problem because Jesse didn't steal it.
I know, Fi. We're gonna have to convince him that someone else stole the money.
someone? Who? - Lei.
well, how are you gonna pull that off?
he's Khan's closest adviser.
which means he had access and opportunity.
I can sell this. You find Barry.
you have him get everything he can about the account Khan used to buy the guns.
if Khan pays Lei from the same place -- we can use it to get Lei's personal bank account.
but if i do get a number, how are you gonna make Jesse say it?
I'm gonna bring Jesse a cheat sheet.
Hey, baby.
I told you on the phone i can't talk now 'cause i'm in a meeting.
Oh, well, uh... Meeting adjourned.
scram, honey.
all right.
what the hell was that?
you just cost me a client, although that was smokin' hot.
my business accounts.
a bad man bought some guns from me.
I need you to trace this wire transfer back to the source.
I need information about the original account -- transfers, linked accounts, names, dates, everything.
Oh, so you only want the moon. That can't be done.
you're asking me to bribe bank officials.
Oh, you've never bribed a bank official?
Yeah, i have, when i'm looking for new clients, but this is my business.
hink i got something here, Mike.
you wanted someone who could pass for a relative of Jesse's -- Kathy Porter from Dallas.
she passed away five days ago.
it's the right age, right complexion.
well, that is perfect, Sam.
Fi, tell me you got something.
lei's personal accounts are in Antigua.
looks like Khan pays him 30 grand a month.
you are a miracle worker.
Yeah, I'm sending you the number now.
Oh, and, Michael, Barry made me promise him dinner to hear how he can maximize my offshore finances.
you owe me. - Yes, i do.
all right, change Kathy's birthplace to Antigua, and we need to adjust the online archive number.
you sure you want to play follow-the-leader with Jesse?
I mean, the guy's not exactly great at taking direction.
I got him into this, sam. I'm gonna get him out.
how's our boy?
still breathing. He won't speak, despite our encouragement.
well, what did i tell you?
if you hurt him, it just makes it that much harder to get anything useful out of him.
the man stole a lot of money from me.
until I find out what happened to it, he's mine to deal with as i please, Mr. Turner.
Jesse probably spent the money years ago.
we should just kill him and be done with it, and stop doing business with strangers.
did you guys talk about killing Jesse in front of him?
in English?
I thought so. There's your problem.
I mean, if a man knows he's gonna die, he has no reason to speak up.
and how will you motivate him -- kind words and a warm cup of tea?
no, with what's inside this briefcase.
few things are more dangerous than passing a message in plain view of hostiles.
to do it, you need a reason to get close to someone.
you don't get to be choosy about how.
looks like we got a bleeder.
Hello, agent Porter.
now, agent Porter, I know why you haven't been talking.
you think you'll be killed if you admit you stole Khan's money.
you need to understand something.
your life is not the only thing that is on the line.
this is an obituary of one Kathy Porter, killed five days ago in a home invasion.
can you see the resemblance?
wait, wait. What?
for what it's worth, she had some nice things to say about you in the end.
no. What, you killed my aunt Kathy? You son of a bitch!
how else was i gonna find you?
you know, she put up a good fight for a civilian.
she is survived by her sister, Deborah. You know her as mom.
I was thinking about paying her a visit next, maybe not.
so I want you to look at this picture very closely when I ask you this question.
the money -- where did it go?
some guy called me.
he, uh -- he said he'd kick back 100 grand in cash if i routed the funds to him to an
an account in Antigua. - Antigua?
that could be someone connected to our banks.
Mr. Khan, let's not discuss our personal affairs.
I want you to give me the account number you sent the money to now!
I don't re-- I don't know! It -- It was a year ago. I can't remember.
it's over. The money's gone.
let's just shoot him!
what did I say about threatening his life?!
I don't know what his problem is, but if you want to find your money, you'll tell him to keep his mouth shut.
lei. Lei, enough.
may i call you Jesse?
I want you to think about your aunt Kathy and about her last moments on earth and whether you want the same thing to happen to the rest of your family.
I want you to look at her and you think about her.
does this jog your memory?
and don't tell me you don't know.
spies -- they're trained to lie.
they're also trained to remember numbers.
he's gonna kill me.
you think I won't kill her?!
that wasn't so hard, now, was it?
now, what you'll need to do is find out whose account -- you're lying! That's mine!
you stay off him! - That's my account!
how did you get that number?! - Khan, you tell him to put that gun down!
I have given you everything you've asked for.
what are you doing?
you know what happens to people who steal from me, huh?! Huh?!
Mr. Khan. Mr. Khan!
I've seen that wound before.
he'll survive, but you got to get him to the hospital.
that was awfully Christian of you, giving Khan free medical advice.
well, I have seen that wound before.
and he'll be dead in five minutes.
Oh, go through all that trouble to save my ass and leave the old guy in charge of the getaway?
buckle up, rookie.
try not to bleed on the upholstery.
got to hand it to you -- your little trio can handle its business.
Yeah, we have a few notches in our belt.
Hey, thank you for this, but i see why the condo next door is vacant.
there's a bee infestation.
it's constant buzzing. It's like I'm living in a freakin' hive. I got to find a new place.
well, there's no need.
we have a friend with a space. Don't we, Michael?
my mom? Fi, I don't think that's a good idea.
she has enough burned spies in her life.
well, I already spoke to her. It's done.
okay, well, thank you, Fiona.
why did you go back to your place when Khan grabbed you?
what was worth the risk?
it's a saint Christopher's medal -- patron saint of safe passage.
it belonged to my mom.
she had a thing about keeping us protected.
well, I guess it worked for you.
Yeah. Yeah, just not for her.
Michael. You're the man.
let's celebrate. - What are we celebrating?
we had a great week.
you won Jesse's trust.
now we can root around inside that brain of his, and by this time Friday, we'll have everything we need.
I wouldn't be too optimistic.
I'm working him for classified details about a conspiracy.
if I push too hard, he'll get suspicious.
well, if you need some help getting him to open up, i have some friends who can help facilitate.
torture.
the point is, Michael, we're on a clock here.
so for Jesse's sake, get at it.
this is my very best gun cleaner.
a little goes a long way.
thank you. I'll use it wisely.
he's trouble.
I like him.
you know, it's really nice of you to let Jesse stay here, but he can't pay you rent.
that's all right.
he's already offered me several grand in I. O.U. S.
mom, I thought you wanted someone nice staying here who liked cats.
now you're sharing gun cleaner.
Yeah, well, nice is overrated.
and i forgot how much i hate cats.
I mean, you and Sam and Fi may be nuts, but, you know, you're doing something with your life, and i-i just like being a part of it.
what kind of sissy wouldn't sleep with a gun under his pillow, anyway?
Michael: love what you've done with the place.
don't knock it. Your mom's my decorator.
I can tell.
Hey, listen, if you're gonna stay here, we should probably talk about why you were burned.
I told you. I got set up.
people don't just get set up for no reason, Jesse.
you asking me about top-secret information, Westen?
well, if you're like me, you won't stop kicking over rocks until you find out what happened.
you're out in the cold, Jess.
it's dangerous to do it alone.
Yeah, so I've noticed.
I was looking into some pretty serious stuff when they threw me out -- wars, terror attacks.
I had a lead on a guy that was tied into it.
maybe i got too close. I don't know.
you want help finding that guy?
look, before I let you in on this, I need to tell you something.
I'm seeing this through.
one day, the old bosses are gonna welcome me back.
they're gonna give me a commendation. I'll smile for the camera.
but then I'm gonna find the person that ruined my life.
and I'm gonna kill him.
are you good with that?
Yeah, I'm good with that.
I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing -- no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...- Should we shoot them?
...an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.
...family, too... - Hey, is that your mom again?
...if you're desperate. - Someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line -- as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
spies come from all walks of life, and no two are exactly alike.
but whether they're a burned former operative,
a beautiful bomber with a temper,
or a hard-drinking ex-seal, they all share one trait -- punctuality.
showing up on time means you're 15 minutes late.
it's noon, Michael.
where the hell is this guy? You think he's still coming?
look, I wouldn't mind, honestly, if Jesse just faded into the mist.
I really don't think we need a counter intelligence agent joining our merry band.
Jesse's investigating the same people we are, Sam.
they nearly killed everyone at this table.
I say we hear him out. - Sure.
get a guy fired, ruin his life.
I'd say you owe him a mojito and a friendly shoulder to cry on, at the very least.
I didn't burn him on purpose, Fi.
well, he may not see it that way.
let's try not to mention it.
Ah, here we are.
looks like Jesse got here on time after all.
people...
on the house, with Carlito's compliments.
nice guy.
I see why you guys like coming here.
I told you this place is secure.
Hey, no offense, man. Can't be too careful.
what I'm about to hit you guys with is pretty heavy.
so, uh, if anybody feels uncomfortable discussing code matters of national security,
you might just want to, you know, leave.
all right, fair enough.
don't say I didn't warn you.
about a year ago, I'm working for the defense department.
get wind of some nasty business -- bombings, assassinations, kidnappings, you name it.
it was global, but it looked like there was a pattern to me.
is that what brought you down to Miami?
Yeah. Yeah, I was looking at weapons supply lines into the hottest spots,
found a connection right here at the port.
a lot of guns coming off of ships that passed through Algeria.
you got a source?
I made contact with a guy shipping artillery for one of the operations,
told him I wanted to move some guns of my own.
did you get a name or a face?
only spoke on the phone.
he had this, uh... This trippy voice.
it was, like, sort of like a low hiss.
it was weird, so I called him cobra.
cobra?
I'm sorry. That's just a -- a crappy code name.
Oh, well, maybe you can make up the code names when it's your investigation.
how about that?
so, I was supposed to meet up with him a couple weeks ago. He didn't show up.
now, I don't know if he got cold feet or what, but if we can find him, we can crack this thing wide open.
looks like we're gonna spend some time down on the docks.
now, hold on, Mike. This sounds dangerous.
before you sign us up for this mission, I want to ask our friend here a very important question.
what kind of snacks do you like?
identifying an illicit weapons shipment from a specific country isn't as simple as checking manifests
or spotting a flag on a ship.
it's too easy for arms dealers to fake both.
but phony paperwork and false flags won't stop crew members from telling you the straight story.
chat up the right deckhand, and you can learn where every shady piece of cargo came on board.
there's no substitute for human intelligence.
okay, nice talking to you.
go ahead, Jesse.
no luck.
crew caught diseases in half the ports in the middle East, but they didn't dock in Algeria.
Fiona: Well, I have more bad news for you, Jesse.
you are never packing the cooler again.
spray cheese and bologna?
you're welcome.
Oh, look at this.
look at this.
looks like the same two scumbags that were here on Tuesday Swiping flatscreens.
come on, little fella, at least take a swing.
probably afraid to. This port's got some gang trouble. You know what?
I'm getting a little tired of watching these poor bastards getting shaken down every other day.
got nothing to do with cobra, Jesse.
scumbags get a pass today.
I don't think they do.
we can't blow our surveillance!
we won't hurt ya. - White '97 Corolla.
you dinged my car in the parking lot, buddy.
what? I drive a Cadillac, and I parked in the street.
do you drive a Cadillac, or did you park on the street?
which is it, you lying son of a bitch? Make up your mind.
what are you looking at, little man?
got nothing to do with you. Get out of here.
Hey, hey, he's not going anywhere.
no, no, no. This is between me and you.
are you deaf, dude? What did I say? What did I say?
get out of here.
I like this guy.
are we good here?
because we should really get back to... -- No, no, it's okay.
I was just telling Hank here how we work undercover for one of the shipping companies.
Oh, that's us -- undercover shipping people.
Yeah, what -- what -- what company is that, again?
Oh, we can't really talk about it.
you know how big corporations like to keep everything quiet.
Hank was just saying the dock's been having some trouble.
I told him we could help. - Yeah, I doubt it.
the guys who busted up my arm... They're mobbed up.
they've been pressuring me and some of the other security staff to help them steal stuff out of the containers.
have you tried going to the police?
Yeah, a buddy of mine, Richie, he went to the police.
they found him facedown in his pool. You think I want to end up like that?
probably not.
can't go against these guys.
I keep hearing about the boss, Tony Caro.
he's ruthless.
and the day of the funeral, he shot up Richard's house
Richie's wife and kids still inside.
charming.
well, it sounds like straight-up racketeering. There's got to be something we can do, right?
set some cameras up, get a little eavesdropping equipment in here?
Hank, why don't you call in sick for the next couple days, see if you can let that hand heal?
you guys really gonna help me?
apparently.
Jesse, we didn't spend all this time on the docks to help a guy deal with some mobsters.
Hey, I'm just doing what you did for me.
you see someone in trouble, you don't stand on the sidelines.
isn't that what you're all about?
what company do we work for, Jesse? Do we get uniforms?
I told Hank what he needed to hear to make him comfortable, all right?
Oh, is he gonna be comfortable when you wire him up?
a few cameras and some eavesdropping -- That's your plan?
what? We get enough tape on these guys. We can wrap it up in a nice little bow for the cops.
what's wrong with that?
he's not trained.
do you know what happens to people who are not trained in the field?
they die.
I'm not trying to get him killed. I'm trying to solve his problem and maybe ours.
Hank could be someone we can work for shipping documents.
a paper trail may be our best hope for finding cobra.
you know, he's actually right, Michael.
how about before we do anything, we find out exactly what we're up against?
Sam: So I checked in with my cop buddy on the organized crime task force.
he gave me this beast.
it's like the yellow pages for Florida's connected.
I guess they had a few left over from the Rico days.
turns out this is their favorite watering hole.
this is a mob bar?
you were expecting red leather booths and Frank Sinatra?
it's Miami, Mike.
I assume the guy in the suit's the boss.
Yep, Tony Caro.
supposedly, he runs things in South Florida for a crime family up in New York.
what else do we have on him?
well, just that he's Miami born and bred, was a suspect in seven murders,
but was never so much as charged. The guy's Mr. Clean.
maybe it's time we threw a little dirt on him.
I can't believe I'm out of lemon juice.
will lime juice do?
I don't know, Madeline.
you know, it depends. Are you willing to settle for b-plus hummus?
I'm not.
I'm kidding.
it'll be fine. All I got to do is add my secret ingredient.
cumin.
it's funny.
seems like the only thing I know about you is you like your food extra-spicy.
what is it you do, again?
michael said, what, government work?
I used to, yeah.
does that have anything to do with why you always leave the house through a different door?
or you never park your car in the same spot on the street?
superstitious, I guess.
I think he's here to see me.
of course he is.
your mom is no joke.
could give most counter intelligent agents a run for their money.
I'm surprised she hasn't broken you yet.
Oh, trust me, I can handle it.
what's the latest on our mob problem?
well, they're careful.
best bet is to convince them that the feds are on to their port operation. Get them to walk away.
okay. How do we do that?
we aren't doing anything.
uh, yes, we are. I want in on it.
they've seen your face, Jesse.
I need to get ears on them.
okay, so you're gonna bug a bunch of wise guys?
good luck with that. They'll be looking for it.
trust me, I can handle it.
ideally, a bug should never be seen by anyone.
but when there's a possibility it may be, it's best to make it look like something people won't want to touch.
a wad of gum stuck to a balled-up piece of tissue
and a sprinkling of whatever's in your lint trap will usually do the trick.
okay, that's disgusting.
Thanks, Sam.
what do you have?
proud of this one, Mikey.
figured we needed a guy who had to appear willing to sell information to a mobster, right?
so, went through a few files, and I found a guy whose identity you could borrow
and whose history over the last six months you could make up and nobody would know the difference.
the suspense is killing me, Sam.
Ned Gordon, recently suspended FBI agent.
real guy apparently is on a drinking binge somewhere in the Alaskan wilderness.
here you go.
what do you think?
not bad, Sam.
not bad? Short of being in the federal computer system, you are all set.
now all you need is a cheap sports coat and some ugly shoes.
organized crime bosses, like senior administrators in any business,
have a lot of people who want to meet with them.
hang around long enough asking for some face time,
and you can get yourself on the schedule,
but don't count on the receptionist offering you coffee while you wait.
listen, you son of a bitch!
I'm doing you a favor letting you sell those TVs in your store!
I'm sorry. It's my son.
I needed to buy some medicine.
when am I gonna get my money?
today, in the afternoon, I swear.
don't let this happen again, or your kid's gonna have other problems
that no amount of medicine's gonna fix, you understand me?
do you understand me?!
get him out of here before I kill him.
this the guy?
says his name's Ned.
you been standing in front of my place for half a day.
you got something you want to talk to me about?
Yeah. If I, uh
if I had some, uh, information about an ongoing investigation into you
into this place, I mean, how much would that be worth to you?
investigation? I don't know what you're talking about.
no, I'm not. I'm
I'm just asking, if I had information,
ballpark, approximate, how much would that be worth to you?
tell you what -- why don't we take it like this?
you tell me who you are and what you got, and I'll decide what it's worth.
no, I -- you know what? Forget it, you know? I should just
it's too late for "forget it," my friend.
who are you?
Inside-left jacket pocket.
what's this?
a fed?!
didn't you frisk this guy before you brought him in?
wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait.
no, I used to be with the bureau. But I'm on leave.
suspension.
for what? - Whiskey, all right?
I -- I'm clean now.
so, you want to talk about my personal life, or do you want to hear what I have to say?
all right.
I'll hear you out, Mr. Former special agent Ned Gordon.
here's what you'll do.
Dean and I are gonna meet you...
...At this place at 4: 00.
all right?
Oh, one other thing.
don't ever come back here again.
ever.
get him out of here.
Fiona: Tony should be here any minute.
stay sharp.
Yeah.
tell that to Michael. Hopefully he can sell this.
here they come.
Where's Tony? - Tony's not coming.
W-what do you mean, he's not coming?
you -- he said -- see, there's just one problem... Special agent Gordon.
you're not special agent Gordon.
you want to tell us who you really are?
take the shot.
wait. - Wait?
take the shot. What are you doing?
giving him a chance to get out of there.
we start putting holes in people, it's gonna get ugly.
don't want to talk? Huh? What?
okay. You got time... To change your mind.
Tony said to kill you real slow.
okay, okay, I'll talk!
no, I'm gonna talk.
I'll talk, I'll talk, I'll talk.
holding someone's arms behind their back is a good technique for a bully on the playground,
but it leaves you very exposed.
I'm gonna talk.
a well-placed kick right beneath the knee will cripple your opponent.
and a crippled opponent can be a great weapon.
the guy can handle himself. I'll give him that.
he has his moments.
Sam: Okay, so listen, Mike. I think I found out how Tony knew that you weren't FBI.
listen to what I got off the bug, earlier.
Tony: I called my guy at the FBI.
that son of a bitch was trying to play us.
Oh, he's got a fed in his pocket. Nice.
that would explain how he avoided getting busted all these years.
so, why are we here, Sam?
so you can tell us Tony's untouchable?
have a little faith, Mike.
I think I found a new angle.
now, you see that guy in there talking to Tony?
that's Gio Russo.
he's a lieutenant in the same New York crime family that Tony works for.
according to the cops, he's down here on "vacation."
turns out he's down here to squeeze Tony.
let's have a listen.
not another word, Tony!
I didn't come down here to watch the situation get worse!
you think it's my fault that the economy's down?
you think that I'm not riding the docks hard enough?
why don't you calm down? - This is calm!
you want to see pissed, come in 15 grand light again next week!
you'll see pissed!
it's been like that all afternoon.
that's bad news for Hank. Tony's not gonna stop squeezing him.
Yeah, but it means he might be desperate enough to make a stupid move.
if we can get him to do some dirty work himself,
we can get him busted for something his fed buddies can't get him out of.
sounds like he needs a little push.
he knows me, Sam.
I think it's time for him to meet Chuck Finley.
now, that's a code name.
how's it going, man?
I know, I know.
listen, we're working on your Tony problem. It's gonna take a little more time, okay?
I can't stay away from the docks any longer. People are asking questions.
I mean, I don't even know what security company you guys are with
Hank, that's not something we can talk about. It's for your own safety.
it's national security, okay?
Yeah, about that... I got those papers you wanted.
this is perfect.
Oh, yeah, this will help. Thank you.
how, exactly?
just go home and get some rest, all right?
what can I do for you?
um, I'm sorry to bother you.
I just, uh -- I found some of Michael's old things in a closet, and I thought maybe you could use them.
got, um, a comforter and some pillows and, um, another lamp.
seeing how dark it gets in here, I just thought, make you feel more at home.
thank you, thank you. You didn't have to.
you saved a lot of Michael's stuff.
you miss having him around?
how about you? Is this your mom?
Yeah.
die?
who said she was dead?
this, uh, photo's been in your wallet a long time.
looks like it's well cared for.
uh, yeah, yeah. She actually passed away when I was 9.
Oh, I'm sorry.
what happened?
uh, she was killed during a robbery at a convenience store.
she was working the graveyard shift.
uh, killer ran off with less than 50 bucks, and she bled out on the floor.
there were people watching from the parking lot, too.
nobody did anything.
so, uh, by the time the cops got there, she was dead.
now you've hooked up with Michael.
gonna try and save the world.
something like that, yeah.
Yeah, Sam?
Yeah, let me get changed. I'll be right there.
grabbing someone who travels with protection
is about finding the moments when they're least protected.
fortunately, even the most paranoid gangster insists on doing some things alone.
executing a successful close-quarters assault is all about setting the stage.
you'll want to dull any reflective surfaces...
corral your target into a corner...
and hit him when he's most vulnerable.
easy. Easy, now.
Night-night.
and it never hurts to have a prearranged exit strategy.
you really think you can scare this dude into pulling something that'll get him busted, huh?
Oh, I know I can.
Really?
cause you don't look that scary.
you haven't seen Chuck Finley in action.
sorry. Coming through.
somebody can't handle his liquor.
you know who I'm with? You know who I am?
I'm a made guy. You touch me
you're gonna threaten me with the family?
who do you think wants you dead?
look, you know as well as anyone you haven't been earning.
is it Gio?
is Gio behind this?
you didn't hear it from me.
wait a minute.
you don't want to do this.
what do you want -- money?
I got 20 grand.
20 grand?
you're funny.
come on.
if you wanted to kill me, I'd be dead already.
Nah. I just like the company.
look, it's nothing personal, but I got a job to do here, or it's my ass swinging in the wind.
it's just the way of the wild, brother.
you don't see the gazelle bargaining with the lion, do you?
listen to me. Listen to me!
you don't want to wake the other guests, do you?
look, if you're gonna keep bellyaching while I'm shining Mr. Slicey, we're gonna have to go back to Mr. Needle.
wait a minute. Hold on a second! What's your name?
let me talk to New York. I'll clear it with them.
now, look, you got a couple million you can kick upstairs, maybe they'll listen.
but, seriously, this is so much easier.
Hey, hey, I can get it! I can get the money!
yeah? How?
you got some kind of score that can pull down that kind of cash?
I don't think so.
at the docks.
Yeah, they got a big shipment coming in.
Oh, it's huge.
I mean, I was just gonna skim it, but, you know, we can hit the whole thing.
$5 million, easy.
so, you're just gonna waltz in there and take $5 million off the docks by yourself?
Hey, I got guys in my crew.
no, Gio has guys in your crew.
all right, look, I'm telling you, I can do this.
just give me 48 hours.
I'll cut you in -- say, a million.
now is not the time to write checks that you can't cash.
No! No, no, no! I'll get you the money! I swear!
all right.
fine.
48 hours... $1 million.
cause I like you.
all right, run along now.
but don't be a stranger, you understand.
cause if I have to find you again, I'm not gonna be so friendly.
and neither will Mr. Slicey.
so, check this out.
I cross-referenced the documents we got at the docks,
figured out which shipment belonged to our boy cobra.
cobra -- that name... Live with it.
anyway, the, uh, weapons went from Algerian ships in the port...
onto the trucks.
and they show up again at the Opa-Locka airport.
any idea where they're headed?
there's no way of telling. The manifests were all forged.
I'm trying to figure out which hangar they went to, though.
my guess is that cobra is working out of there.
Yeah, Sam? How'd it go with Tony?
Yeah, Mike, I got good news and bad news.
good news is, Tony's gonna hit the docks -- something big.
bad news?
well, he's back at his place, making calls to his crew to pull off the score.
I tried to convince him that he couldn't trust them, but I guess he's sentimental.
well, we'll just have to cure him of that, won't we?
right there with you, Mikey.
already called Fi.
convincing a general that he can't trust his soldiers is an ancient and time-honored strategy.
in ancient Rome, staging a botched assassination usually involved poisoning a few slaves.
today, the same effect can be achieved with a cheap cellphone and a brick of explosive.
Hey, there.
got your message.
what's up?
you know how, uh, you said my guys couldn't be trusted?
indeed I do.
well, you were right. They just tried to take me out.
well, then, we have a problem, don't we?
cause I seem to recall I was promised a million dollars.
I can get the money, all right.
yeah? Yeah. How?
you and me, together. We can do this.
listen, it'll be a great score. You put the guys together
look, if I put together the crew, my cut's gonna be a lot bigger than a million.
fine, $2 million.
that's more like it.
all right, tell you what.
you come up with a plan, I'll make some calls, put together some manpower.
all right. I'll be in touch.
Hey, Tony.
I'm really glad I didn't cut you into little pieces.
don't make me regret my decision, huh?
Yeah, Mike. It's me.
looks like I'm Tony's new partner.
Hank, it's not that complicated.
Tony's gonna try to rob the docks.
we're gonna make sure he gets caught doing it.
he gets busted, his operation rolls up, and your problem goes away.
wait, but you're gonna actually help him do this?
nothing's gonna get stolen.
we just have to make sure that the mouse goes after the cheese.
and when he does...
shouldn't we talk to the police?
look, Hank, we're not supposed to tell you this.
Tony's got an FBI agent in his pocket.
he'd just get tipped off. This is how it has to be.
all right. What do I have to do?
well, that's the good part, Hank.
you get to be the hero.
you get to be the one who stops the heist.
Sam's gonna be meeting with Tony later.
you just go to work. Everything will be fine.
Yeah, okay. I'll see you guys later.
Sam's gonna need some backup.
I'm there.
Fi, you know as well as I do that Tony's going to be expecting Sam's right-hand man to be...
Well...a man.
looks like I'm coming off the bench, then.
now, the shipment's coming in there.
usually, we'd just hit a few crates, but if we take this whole thing, it's gonna be a hell of a score.
what's in the crates?
microprocessors.
you know, the stuff they put in computers?
50, 000 units. Street value -- $5 million.
guess that would explain the security -- The electric fence, gate... Rent-a-cops.
the shipment's gonna be in a box truck inside that warehouse.
you guys can get in there, you're gonna be able to drive right out.
I'll take care of the sales, any -- hold on.
we're going in there?
Yeah.
you're coming with us.
uh -- no, no, no, no, you don't understand.
I don't do that stuff anymore.
you see, I've paid my dues. I'm a boss.
well, my friend, you will not be a boss for much longer unless you plan on coming with us.
I'm not doing it.
look, Tony, you're on a team with Chuck, he takes care of you.
I'm not gonna do it.
he takes care -- Tell him about the time you, uh, saved your navy seal buddy in El Salvador.
come on, tell him, man.
it was the '80s.
I led a fact-finding team into the country.
there were five of us, including my buddy Pete.
course, the, uh, death squads were none too happy to see us,
so we came under fire, and Pete took one in the spine.
he wanted me to dump him, leave him behind.
I sent the team ahead, and Pete and I hole up in some church for a couple days,
living off of communion wafers.
finally, a couple black hawks airlifted us out of there.
the point is, no man left behind.
that's the promise I make, the promise I keep.
that's a hell of a story, Chuck.
so, what do you say? You in?
Yeah, I'm in.
let's do this.
what the hell was that?
what? The story? Michael mentioned it.
no, it's not just a story.
this is me. It's my real life.
I don't pimp my past to bad guys, you understand?
it worked, didn't it?
bingo. Bingo.
Hey, Michael? It's Jesse. I need to talk to you, man.
Yeah, I heard about what happened with Sam.
word to the wise -- stay out of his war stories from now on.
come on, man, the guy's an ex-navy seal.
he's probably told that story a million times.
that's not the point, Jesse.
you know, okay. Point taken. Point taken.
that's not why I called. Listen, I think I found cobra's warehouse at the airport.
well, I think we should get over there.
Yeah, I think we should. I'm gonna come pick you up.
all right.
fresh-baked chocolate chips.
what? Word got out about my cookies, huh?
Oh, good.
you heading out somewhere?
Yeah, I'm gonna go meet Michael.
that doesn't narrow it down much.
you're not gonna stop, are you? - What?
you're just gonna keep on pushing till you find out who I am.
so you know what? I'm gonna save us both some time, all right?
I was a counter intelligence agent up until about a month ago, when I was... Fired.
uh, somebody used my security access to steal some classified files.
lucky for me, your son was there to help me.
was he? - Oh, yeah.
Yeah, he saved my life.
you raised a good man. You should know that.
I'll see you later, all right?
well, if it is cobra's hangar, he's not here now.
I wish he was, just so we could ask him what he thinks of the code name "cobra."
it's the same tail number as the plane he used to move his weapons.
what do you think? We could wait for him.
just no telling when he'd show up.
one reason it's tough to pull off the perfect crime is destroying evidence leaves its own evidence.
if a section of floor has been cleaned with a powerful surfactant,
it sticks out like a drop of bleach on a shirt, begging the question,
what did someone go to so much trouble to clean?
what is that, grease?
blood. Looks like somebody was dumping a body.
think it was cobra? That would explain why he disappeared.
well, if it was him, he'll be tough to find.
dump a body this way, it just drops out of the sky when the landing gear deploys.
guess we're gonna have to track down the last place this baby flew.
Yeah, we're all set, Tony.
the team's ready.
Oh, you're excited?
w-well, it's not exactly like the mission in El Salvador.
I-I guess they're similar.
Yeah, okay, I'll see you there.
the guy will not stop calling me.
he thinks he's part of a frickin' platoon now.
Aww, he likes you, Sam.
Yeah, I don't need friends like that, 'cause when this is over, he wants me to kill his whole crew, families included.
the guy's a piece of work.
what's up, Hank?
he's gonna see me.
look, by the time he sees you, he's gonna be halfway to prison.
so just stick with the plan, Hank.
it'll be fine.
this it?
this the whole team?
I got a few others around.
what about on the road, looking out for cops?
Yeah. Around the perimeter, too.
don't worry. I got it covered.
all right, we're on the clock here.
three minutes from the time we breach the fence to the time we drive out.
anything goes wrong, we scatter and regroup.
Roger that.
road team, set?
set.
perimeter team, set?
set.
sniper team, set?
set. I got eyes on security, south side of the building.
take the shot -- give them a flat tire as they come around the corner.
Roger that.
security car disabled.
copy that. Okay. We're good to go.
if you're cutting through a high-powered electric fence,
you need more than rubber gloves and a pair of thick-soled shoes.
covering a fence with spray-on insulation
and using a set of fiberglass-handled bolt cutters
will keep you from lighting up like a Christmas tree.
hold on there, Chuck.
all right, you're clear.
a shape charge large enough to go through a wall
is also large enough to let everyone for several miles
know what you're doing.
a smaller charge can be just as useful and a lot less noisy.
a hydraulic spreader puts out enough pressure to rip a door off a humvee.
placed correctly, it will make short work of reinforced concrete.
$5 million!
it's a beautiful thing.
we can admire it later. Get it started. Let's get out of here.
we got two minutes!
all right, I'll get the guard to open the gate.
you meet me on the other side. You got it?
I'll be there.
okay, Hank. This is it. Open the gate.
you sure about this?
look, we've already called in the stolen truck.
every cop in Miami is gonna be waiting for him about a mile from the port.
but he's not gonna be there unless you open the gate now.
good. Take my gun and lead me out.
you sell this, we're home free.
just point the end with the hole at me, and, uh, try not to shake too much.
go! Get out of here!
is it over?
Yeah, will be soon.
cops should be closing in shortly.
Mike, what's going on?
Jesse and Fi clear? - All clear.
you got a visual on Tony?
looking good, Sam.
he stopped, Sam. Something's wrong.
what do you mean, he stopped?
a spy's job is to get into the heads of his adversary, to know how he'll behave and use it against him.
but human behavior's about as predictable as the weather.
sometimes the most hardened criminal can decide to be noble at the most inconvenient time.
looks like Tony had second thoughts about leaving you behind.
What?!
he's coming back, Sam.
okay, Hank, I got to hit you in a second.
and when I do, you run like hell and don't look back.
wait, I-I don't need you
what the hell happened?
leave no man behind, right?
you didn't leave your buddy in El Salvador, and I'm not leaving you.
the truck is trashed. We got to get out of here. Come on, let's go!
hang on.
I don't hear the sirens anymore.
I think we can stop running.
what happened back there?
my gun jammed. The guy got the drop on me.
what the hell are we gonna do? - I don't know what to tell you.
you got a big problem here, Tony.
look, maybe you should just run. Just get the hell out of town.
no, no, no, no.
I'm not gonna lam it.
you've got New York after you.
look, we caught a bad break today.
but you and me, we make a great team.
you got a good crew.
come on, we can do something here, make a move.
what are you trying to say, Tony?
you and me, we take out Gio.
I take over, show New York who's boss.
wait a second.
you're trying to get me to help you kill Gio?
I'm telling you, this'll work.
we take him out, his guys, everyone.
Hey, how many bodies you gonna drop here?
as much as it takes! Tried to kill me!
I'm telling you, this'll work. We hit 'em hard, leave no one alive.
come on. Listen.
gio and his crew go to the track every Friday.
we can hit him then.
all we need is cars, muscle, and guns.
come on, are we in? Huh?
you're in. Let's go!
okay, I am now officially the closest friend of a total psychopath.
this is great. This is just great.
I don't even want this.
so what did you say?
well, what could I say? I told him I would think about it.
I mean, what the hell we gonna do now?
he wants to go after Gio's crew and start a war, all because his best buddy,
Chuck, was such a stand-up guy back in El Salvador.
all right, so let's let him start a war.
we wanted Tony to stick his neck out, right?
it's just as easy to get him busted for going after Gio as it is to get him busted for ripping off some warehouse.
tell me he's joking.
we don't have a lot of other choices, Sam.
I'm not saying I love the idea, but it could help Hank get out from under Tony's thumb.
I kind of like it, actually.
taking out half of Miami's wise guys in one afternoon?
we haven't done that before.
look, I hate to be the naysayer here, but Tony is expecting an army,
and last time I checked, we don't have an army.
Oh, we'll give him an army.
creating the illusion of force is one of the oldest tricks in warfare.
the rise of the private security guard has made it a lot easier.
post a job opening on the Internet in the morning,
and by lunch, you can have a whole platoon of muscular guys in black blazers.
17-inch arms?
lose the jacket. Let me see 'em.
you've got a job.
hire some heavy duty s. U.V. S - To put your "security force" in place... - Next!
...and it'll look just like you've got troops ready for battle.
all right, you guys are gonna follow the lead car to this spot, okay?
single-file line.
keep it tight. Let's go.
you ready to do this?
Yes, I am.
you won't regret this. Once I'm the boss, I'm gonna need some guys -- Good guys.
I won't forget what you did for me. - I'm sure you won't.
now, look, as soon as we see Gio, my snipers are gonna put a few slugs through his engine block.
we drive up, you pop out with that bad boy.
you let Gio know who's running the show here.
my snipers have got you covered, and I'm behind you all the way.
all right, let's do this.
you're the boss.
will be soon, anyway.
we've got eyes on Gio.
okay, let's light him up.
military leaders since the city-states of early greece
have known that a tried and tested method for getting rid of an adversary
is to provoke him to attack a more powerful enemy.
provide an ambitious adversary with the backing of a seemingly invincible army,
and he's bound to go hunting for even his toughest rival.
get out, you son of a bitch, and face me like a man!
Tony, what the hell are you doing?
you think you can take me out 'cause I was a few dollars short?
what the hell are you talking about?
okay, let's move.
I'll tell you what I'm talking about.
I'm mixing things up right now.
I got a new crew, and I got a new way of doing things.
and this town's got a new boss -- me.
Chuck...Get up here!
making sure your adversary is eliminated...
Chuck, what are you doing?!
...then becomes about pulling that backing once he's declared war on his rival...
...when it's too late for him to take it all back.
you just made a very big mistake, Tony.
you mother...
10 arrests so far on the docks, and they're only getting started.
about Tony -- what happened?
he's in the Miami-dade prison hospital.
charged with killing Gio.
I don't think anyone will be hearing from him for a while.
what happens when people start asking questions about the security team that cleaned up the docks.
what should I say?
probably best if you don't say anything.
some stories, you just don't tell.
so, got some information on that cargo plane that was in the hangar at, uh, Opa-Locka.
last flight -- the Bahamas.
and wouldn't you know it?
same day a John Doe washed ashore.
I should head down there and check it out.
Fiona has some connections. She can make some arrangements.
what, you can get me off the no-fly list?
not exactly, but I can get you into the cargo bay of a cigarette boat.
trip's about two hours.
can't think of a nicer way to spend a Saturday.
mom, you came to visit?
what's the occasion?
the occasion?
how about what you did to Jesse?
I don't know what he told you
he didn't tell me anything, except that he lost his job last month.
and you think I have something to do with that?
Michael, just stop!
I was there when you decided to join the army,
and I remember the look on your face when you had to tell your brother about it,
how you felt like you were betraying him by leaving him behind with your father.
and you had the same look on your face when you brought Jesse around!
I knew you did this kind of stuff, but seeing it up close and personal like this is...
you know, you have no idea how delicate of a situation I'm in.
there are things you don't know, things I can't talk about, things I can't explain.
Oh, please.
I'm not gonna give away your secret, Michael.
I just want to know how you can pretend to be his friend.
I am his friend! I'm the best friend he has right now!
I'm helping him!
you're lying to him!
take it from me, lies get out.
30 years with your father taught me that.
I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing -- no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am i? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...- Should we shoot them?
...an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.
...family, too... - Hey, is that your mom again?
...if you're desperate. - Someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line - as long as you're burned, You're not going anywhere.
spies spend out but they don't usually end up in the most desirable destinations.
you're much more likely to find yourself visiting a rebel camp in the Philippine jungle or a hidden bunker in the mountains of Pakistan than lounging beach-side in the Bahamas.
but even when you do find yourself in a vacation paradise, it's still all about business.
Michael, I can't believe I waited this long to come to the Bahamas.
I am at the loveliest little beach bar.
you're at a bar?
what happened to identifying a dead body at the morgue?
Oh, relax.
Jesse and I are hard at work.
I doubt the autopsy report was hidden under a keg of red stripe.
verifying the identity of a dead weapons runner is not the vacation a girl dreams of.
you know, don't get mad if I have a little fun.
Fi, Jesse's contact wasn't just a weapons runner.
I know.
he worked for whoever is behind all this international nastiness that you're trying to stop.
I just spent two hours on a boat with Jesse singing the same old song.
and he's even more worked up about it than you are.
lucky for both of you, I met Ty -- the delightful coroner's assistant...who's about to loan me his keys.
we call this "The love boat."
you can't leave the island without trying one of these - Oh, no, you can't.
like magicians, pickpockets rely on misdirection.
you like it? - I like it.
whether you're pulling keys out of a pocket or a rabbit out of a hat, it's all about big distractions.
I can't stop. - Very good.
you ready to go, sweetbread?
excuse me?
Oh, come now. You've been eyeing me since you walked in.
you don't think I see you flirting with me?
time to dance! - Oh, no.
easy, girl. Don't be a tease.
yo, let her go.
why you want a confrontation?
back away before you get clapped, man!
what, boy? You back up!
no, no, no! Don't hurt him!
break it up! Let him go! Break it up!
that's okay.
time's a ticking, Jesse.
Yeah, I'm going as fast as I can, Fi.
apparently, this guy's method of filing things is too bad.
Jesse... - Wait. Hold on.
Yeah. I got it.
good, because Ty just walked in with a cop buddy.
you need help making it out?
Nah. Getting by that guy will be a piece of cake.
just leave me the car and go get the boat.
keys are under the mat, hotshot.
spies don't always have a choice of hiding places.
sometimes it comes down to taking what's available.
but if you have to hide in something that's designed to be airtight, you better hope the danger passes before you run out of oxygen.
I guess I forgot them.
that's the guy! Stop that guy!
gun it! - Piece of cake, huh?
just go!
we've got pictures.
let me see.
this is the view from my hotel balcony. It's gorgeous, isn't it?
Oh, look. Oh, and this is me on the beach before I went dancing with Ty.
I was really hoping to see pictures of the autopsy report.
I got to warn you, these are not pretty.
being strangled and dropped from an airplane, it pretty much guarantees a closed-casket funeral.
check out the part about the tissue under the nails.
whoever killed him has the scratches to prove it.
anything in here that proves our dead guy was the arms shipper we were looking for?
well, the guy I spoke to had a Lebanese accent.
our John Doe here is of middle eastern descent.
my guy had a raspy voice, remember?
this guy's got thoracic scarring consistent with heavy smoking, so it looks like we got a match.
we should get John Doe's prints over to Sam.
I knew you'd say that. Faxed him a copy as soon as we hit the mainland.
Sam's got a buddy at Homeland Security that's gonna run them for us.
no need to do that.
Sam already called you back.
why don't you just bring me up to speed all at once?
the dead body belongs to Jeremiah Kassar.
name's linked to an address, but it's a P. O. Box place called "Mailon More" on 1st Avenue.
well, you can't rent a box without giving a real address. Let's check it out.
anything else I should know about?
did I mention that Sam wants you to do him a favor in exchange for turning these around so fast?
and he's waiting outside? - Yep
fi and I can track down Kassar's real address.
you can go take care of Sam.
Hey, Mikey. Can we take your car? Mine's running on "E."
sure, Sam. What's up?
Oh, we're just gonna meet some friends -- Josh and Lila Wagner.
is this a job?
well, you're gonna love 'em, Mike.
they run this great little charity called "Help at home."
they work with soldiers' families who were killed in combat.
I volunteer all the time.
last Christmas, I was "Sammy" Claus for the kids.
that's really great of you.
Yeah. - Yeah. So this is a job?
well, it's more like a consultation.
I don't have all the details, but Josh got caught up in a scam.
he invested the charity's money in a company called blue crest
just tiny amounts at first.
all of a sudden, he saw huge returns.
Hey, you're a psychic!
then after a while, Josh starts to think how many more people he could help if he just turned up the volume a little.
he decides to go all-in, and, next thing you know, money's gone.
sounds like the cops could consult on this.
they tried it, Mike.
once the cops got a look at the paper trail, they said it would take months to wade through.
all I want you to do is just hear what the problem is and point us in the right direction.
and that's it? - Yep.
point you in the right direction and I go home?
Yeah, that's it.
and for that, you get that warm, fuzzy feeling that comes with giving back.
Plus, a free lunch, Mike.
ribs!
you got to try these ribs, Mike.
Josh marinates them in beer for two days.
you hear what I'm talking? Two days.
Sam, you have to go talk to Josh.
well, that's why we're here.
no, he left. He went to go confront Nick Madison.
OK . Lila, just slow down here.
Madison is the guy that took the money?
the bank called, and they said there's nothing we can do.
the charity's getting shut down on Monday.
I didn't know it was that bad, Sam.
it is, and Josh blames himself.
I-I've never seen him this upset.
h-he went to blue crest now.
he wants to make Madison give the money back.
I just don't want him to make things worse.
okay, look. Don't worry about it. We'll find Josh and make sure nothing bad happens.
okay. Thank you.
this is starting to feel like a job, Sam.
relax, Mike. This'll take less than a day out of your busy life.
and, look, until Fi and Jesse Find the real address for Kassar, What else you got to do?
Yeah, so if we could just have that address, We'd be so grateful.
it's kind of an emergency - we're, uh...
we're leaving on our honeymoon cruise tomorrow, aren't we, sweet potato?
Oh, that's so sweet.
Yeah, well, it would be if we were legally married.
Scott's divorce just came through, and his ex-wife's idiot lawyer, Jeremiah Kassar, he sent us copies of the paperwork.
and we need the originals, baby. - I know, I know, I know.
I got to track this guy down today.
we need a home address.
Oh, I see.
what's that?
our confidentiality policy.
there's no way I'm giving you that address.
but my parents, they're flying in to see us off from New York.
in the field, you can never count on your first approach being successful.
you have to be ready to change tactics on the fly.
spies learn to make lightning-fast observations and connect the dots just as quickly.
little things like a family photo with no father.
and a missing wedding ring can tell you all you need to know about a target's soft spot, or better yet, their sore spot.
you want to leave now, or should I call the cops?
you know what?
let it go, Tanya.
we're gonna have to get a court order.
look, the truth is Jeremiah kassar is not a lawyer.
he's a scumbag.
we're with an organization called deadbeat dad trackers.
kassar is two years behind on his child-support payments.
two years? - Two years.
and we can go through official channels, but it takes a while, you know?
and when I think of his poor little kids, I just...
they deserve a decent pair of shoes.
come on. Let's go.
wait.
how do you spell his name?
Josh is here, all right.
that's his car.
nice parking job.
Yeah, well, he's probably upset. I mean, the guy on the verge of losing his life's work, here.
Sam, how far will Josh take this?
I don't know. Why?
I think he brought his gun.
just give me the money back!
I don't have it! I swear to God I did not steal from you.
Liar!- He's not l-lying!
please don't s-shoot us, Mr. Wagner! Please!
you don't want to do this.
Sam?! What the hell are you doing here?
I'm here to help. Just put that down. - Who are you?!
my name's Michael. I'm a friend of Sam's.
listen. Let's talk about this. - No!
there's a better way to handle this, Josh. - No, no, no!
I tried better ways, Sam.
I-I-I went to the police.
I asked nicely.
nothing happened. Nothing worked. I am out of options!
we don't anybody to get hurt, Josh.
we don't want you to go to jail.
I deserve to go to jail for trusting the charity's money to this thieving bastard!
I'm not going anywhere.
understand me?
not until I get every penny of that money back.
Josh, buddy.
I know that you're upset, but
Oh, my God!
I'm not your goddamn buddy.
who called the cops?
okay. Get in there! - Josh, what are you doing?
I'm locking them in the break room.
leave, Sam.
this is my problem.
Mike, Josh is a good man. I got to help him.
if he won't give us that gun, we're gonna have to take it.
Miami police! Come out with your hands up!
Sam, what are you doing?
we need to get Josh out of here so nobody gets hurt.
this might not be the smart play, Mike...
...but I'm following my gut on this one.
I'm helping Josh.
you're not changing my mind. Now move, Mike!
how? By making this a hostage situation? Come on, Sam.
it's already a hostage situation, Mike!
no matter how you cut this deck, Josh is going to jail.
I can't get his life back, but I can sure as hell make sure that Madison doesn't get rich robbing the children of dead veterans!
fine!
if this is about the money, let's get everybody out, then go after the money.
yeah? How? Look! They're packing up shop, Mike.
we let them walk now, he's gonna be gone before the cops take Josh's mug shot!
what the hell are you doing?
how many times do I got to tell you? Leave!
I'm not going anywhere.
you want your money back, you're gonna need some help.
what? No! This is my fault!
I'll fix this.
that would be the police.
Oh, my God.
they're not answering, lieutenant.
this is lieutenant Seth Casey, Miami Metro police.
anyone if you want this to work out, you will pick up the phone right now.
we need to talk.
W-what do I do? What do I say?
Mike, this train's about to start moving real fast.
it's not too late for you to hop off, but I'm staying.
in a hostage crisis, first contact with the police is critical.
one wrong word from a hostage-taker can be the difference between the start of negotiations or the start of an armed assault.
pick up the phone!
stop!
he said I should -- Leave it.
you sound like you're gonna jump off a bridge.
you answer a phone like that, and you'll have a SWAT team banging through the door before you hang up.
I'll get it.
I leave when you leave.
Hello? Hello?
who am I speaking with?
he says I can't answer any of your questions.
he says that no will get hurt as long you don't come any closer.
O-okay, but tell him I can't help him unless I can talk to him.
he says I got to go.
wait, wait, wait. Don't hang up.
tell him the line's open. Anytime he wants to talk, all he has to do is
you hung up on him?
this is more of a "Less is more" situation. I'm just buying time.
okay, Josh, we're gonna help you get your money back, but only if you let us call the shots.
are you sure about this? You could go to jail.
right now we're just two friends trying to end this peacefully.
as long as it stays that way, Mike and I can get your money back and stay out of jail.
deal? - Deal.
sorry, Josh.
can't have anybody getting shot by accident.
no bullets?
I was just trying to scare them.
I'd say you pulled that off.
find out who works in that office.
see who these cars belong to.
I'm already on it.
no phone, no Internet, no a/c.
a little time in the sauna, and he'll want to talk.
what do we do now?
now we separate Nick and Patty and get some answers.
I got dibs on Nick.
he won't be able to talk with you choking him.
I'll start with Nick.
you take Patty.
you okay?
who are you again?
name's Michael.
I'm just a friend who doesn't want anybody to get hurt.
I asked Josh if I could talk to you.
to me?
he's the whack job running around cracking people in the face with guns.
t-tell him to let me go!
I tried that, Patty.
I did everything I could to walk him out of this building, but it looks like we're gonna need your help, because, see, he's not leaving until he gets his money back.
I know Mr. Wagner is upset, but he is blaming the wrong people.
it's like Nick says - investing is a risk.
you know, you're everybody's best friend As long as the cash is rolling in, but the second somebody takes a loss, guess who they're pointing the finger at?
is that fair? Is it my fault that the economy crashed?
I am not judging you, Nick.
I mean, these are tough times.
you get a little behind.
it's hard to catch up.
so maybe you move some money around.
it's not stealing. It's just buying time.
but if you want to get out of here alive, then you're gonna have to come clean.
what do you want me to do?
tell me where the money is!
we didn't steal any money!
do you know why Josh snapped, Patty?
because innocent families -- And I'm talking widows and little kids -- Are gonna be out on the street.
do you know why?
because your boss looted his charity, and you helped him do it!
that is a lie!
Nick would never do anything like that.
you're talking about a man who was in tears when he had to lay off his staff.
he felt so bad, he's been helping Tom Norris with his mortgage the last few months out of his own pocket!
that's the Nick Madison I know.
what if I give you the computer, uh, password
the password to our computer system?
you could access Josh's client file.
Um...There's transaction records, account statements, balance sheets the whole nine.
you could tell him that I-I didn't do anything wrong.
maybe he'd believe you.
here's the last printout.
when interrogators hear a story without any holes, they know someone's lying.
only people who are afraid of getting caught take the time to rehearse every detail and anticipate every question.
so? What's the good news?
the same holds true for accounting.
perfect books are like perfect alibis -- It confirms you're dealing with a liar.
but there's no way to prove it.
there's nothing here. Nick must have another set of books.
they might not even be in the building.
can't we just make him tell us?
Nick's smart enough to know he can keep denying everything and wait for the cops.
what about Patty?
she's innocent.
Nick conned her like everybody else.
so, what are you telling me? I did all this for nothing?
I'm not gonna get the money back and I'm gonna go to jail?
hang on. Patty mentioned a Tom Norris.
Norris, yeah -- he was the first guy I talked to when I started investing with blue crest.
Patty said he's Nick's right-hand man.
dollars to donuts he knows where that money is.
talking to him might be the best move at this point.
am I missing something, because it sounds as though You plan to talk to someone who's not here!
relax, Josh. We still have friends outside that can help.
how are we gonna call him? We're not allowed to use the phone.
we can't use that phone.
dig up what you can on Norris.
put Nick in the break room with Patty.
I'll find a way to call out.
in a hostage situation, It's standard procedure for police to run cellphone jammers and commandeer all the phone lines in your location.
to make a call without a police operator, you need to access a line they're not listening on.
it's a lot like stealing cable from your neighbor.
if you can access a common wall and stretch the conduit, you can connect your phone to the unmonitored line next door.
Mike, that password Nick gave you Got me into Norris' personnel file.
I got an address, social security number
everything but his turn-ons and his turn-offs. How long is this gonna take?
well, it'll go faster if you'd give me a little room!
trying to help.
no, Michael's still not answering his phone.
got a feeling Michael's gonna want to be here When we find out what Kassar was up to.
well, Sam's favors tend to involve a lot of food and drink.
they probably haven't made it past the appetizers yet.
well, I guess he'll have to miss out on all the fun.
will it be starting anytime soon, speedy?
kassar wasn't taking any chances.
he's got a double-cylinder dead bolt, which probably cost more than his car.
this could take a minute.
well, we may not have a minute. Here comes the welcoming committee.
can I help you?
you know, you may already have. Did you send in your census questionnaire yet?
we're with the census bureau.
your neighbor here didn't take advantage of the self-addressed, stamped envelope we provided, which means we need to conduct an in-person intervie.
Yeah.
do you guys have I. D.'s?
I hate to sound paranoid, but we had break-ins around here recently.
Really?
that is a thing in this neighborhood?
of course we have I. D."s. Yeah, mine is in my briefcase, which is in the car.
in the car.- Hers -- in the car.
Oh, would that be the gray mustang that's parked out front -- License number G-C-6-J-2-7?
strangers make us a little nervous these days.
Oh, it's a, uh, supervisor. We got to go. Sorry.
he's a ball-buster. We got to take this.
okay.
Fi. Fi, it's me.
perfect timing.
kassar has the nosy neighbor from hell.
I think getting into this place isn't gonna be as easy.
Fi, Fi, let's worry about that later.
right now Sam and I are in the middle of a hostage situation.
Jesus, Michael!
well, tell me where you are and who's holding you.
it's more like... We're the hostage-takers.
I-I'll explain later.
right now, I need you to find someone.
it's Michael. Get the details.
hurry. Hurry up and open it.
everything okay here, Josh?
everything's great.
I told Josh, if it helps, that I would show him our bank accounts.
not just the company's, but my own personal statements.
trust me, buddy - after you see these, you will know that we are all in the same boat.
here's your proof.
you're not trying to help us! You're with him!
so this is your show, huh?
well, you had me going there for a minute, Mr. Good samaritan.
I don't want anybody hurt.
take him to the break room. - Let's go. Come on.
you know what this means, don't you?
you're all going to jail!
armed kidnapping...
unlawful confinement... Madison's right
we're looking at some serious jail time, Mike.
you're not helping the mood, Sam.
sorry I got you into this, brother.
I'm the one who decided to stay.
funny.
when I was 10 years old, I wanted an air rifle more than anything in the whole world, but my dad wouldn't get it for me.
so I used my five-finger discount.
you got caught stealing a bb gun?
Mike, it was a red ryder, okay?
my dad told the cops to lock me up for a couple hours -- You know, just to freak me out.
I haven't seen the inside of a jail cell since.
it's a little early to call it a day, Sam.
we still got some cards to play.
can I talk to...Casey?
is this Nick?
or Josh? Or Michael Westen?
you still there?
Yeah. I can't answer any questions.
I-I understand, and I won't get you in trouble, but I need to ask a very important question.
now, if the answer is yes, just say," I can't answer that."
is everyone safe?
I can't answer that.
he says he wants a panel van -- full tank of gas, no side or back windows.
he says he'll hurt one of us if he doesn't see it in an hour.
I-I'd love to help, but I need a sign of good faith.
I can't give him a van until he releases one of the hostages.
okay. He says he'll let one of us go as soon as he sees the van.
we got good news.
we have an escape vehicle coming.
bad news?
the negotiator knows I'm in here. - Ah, geez, Mike. Look, maybe we should just pull the plug.
I'll talk to the cops, tell 'em that we forced you to help.
one problem at a time, Sam.
first the money, then the escape.
let's just hope Fi and Jesse can get their hands on Norris.
making a cold approach to a scam artist is never ideal.
they tend to assume that a stranger showing up out of the blue is either a cop or someone they've ripped off.
my man, Tommy!
how you been, dude? Listen, we need to
either way, you have to be ready for them to run.
fortunately, tactical support can make a foot chase much more civilized.
instead of relying on speed and endurance, all you need is a distraction and good timing.
stings, doesn't it? - I want my lawyer.
well, that would help if we were cops.
but we work for Nick. - What?
Oh, come on now, Tommy.
you know those marks that come in, just asking to get taken.
who do you think is sending them to you, huh?
we're here for our latest cut.
wait a minute. You're the crew from Boca?
why didn't you say something?
you didn't give me a chance to!
I'm sorry, man! I got spooked!
What'd you come to me for, anyway? I mean, you know Nick handles the payouts.
you haven't heard.
get in the car.
what the hell happened?
place got raided a couple hours ago.
Nick gave us a heads-up on his way out of town. Said we can get our cut from you.
he didn't even call me.
focus on our money, Tom.
I don't have your money.
you have access to the account, right?
what account? Don't you get it?
every time we wrap up a big score, Nick converts the check to cash.
he's got a floor safe in the conference room.
you think he'll fit?
lucky you, Michael. You're sitting on the money.
Nick has a floor safe under the carpet in the conference room.
crack that puppy and come on out with your hands up.
it won't be that easy, Fi.
Sam and I are on the hook for accomplices now.
seriously, Michael?
you have to stop doing favors for Sam.
have you requested a getaway vehicle?
Yeah. It's on the way.
well, you're gonna need a diversion, and judging from the police turnout, it's gonna have to be a big one.
Fi, if there ever was a time to pull out all the stops, this is it.
I never thought I'd hear you say those words.
move over. You're lying on my C-4.
he's got it in cash?
it's the last phase of scams like this.
cash is almost impossible to trace.
Yeah, especially when you use it to buy a million-dollar yacht and sail into early retirement.
looky there.
well, hello.
son of a bitch.
I'll be right back.
Sam, Madison's not gonna give him the combination.
Yeah, I know, Mike. We're gonna have to find another way to get into that safe.
I got this one, Mikey.
we found the safe, you bastard. Now what's the combination?!
what safe? What is he talking about?
Oh, you didn't know?
Yeah, the money Nick stole is in a floor safe right out there.
is that true?
well, there's a safe, yeah.
but there is no money in it.
well, then-then give up the combination!
show them it's empty so we can go home!
it's not empty.
our clients' most sensitive information is in there.
that's what these guys are really after, and when they get it, they'll kill us.
give me back the money.
back off, Josh.
do you know what's stopping me from killing you right now?
absolutely nothing.
kidnapping or murder, I die in prison either way.
killing me won't get you the combination!
okay.
we'll just have to do this the hard way.
what -- what are you doing?
I don't care if you burn me or electrocute me or whatever it is you're thinking!
relax, Nick.
I just want to borrow your toaster.
floor safes are virtually impenetrable as long as they're in the floor.
if you don't have a jackhammer to pry one out, You need to get creative.
homemade shape charges will do the trick, but if you want to avoid turning a standoff into a full-scale breach, you'd better have a way to muffle the blast.
Hey, Mikey. Our buddy Nick has some top-of-the-line clubs... Titanium.
once a floor safe is out of the floor, it offers about as much protection as a piggy bank.
looks like there's more than a million there, but you might want to count it just to make sure.
Oh, my God. You said there was no money.
shut up.
down, down.
it's okay. Everything's okay. Sit down and shut up!
I just need to take you to the break room, all right?
you're okay.
you're okay.
you think they heard that?
team 1, strike positions.
copy that. Moving.
Fi, this is not good.
this is not good.
Michael, what's up? The cops are in place. They're about to breach. We're not ready.
forget about the diversion, Fi.
how much time do we have?
well, they already have entry teams in place with breaching rounds.
they still need perimeter support.
you've got about five minutes at best.
what are you gonna do?
I wish I knew.
how's it looking, Sam? Fi said we got about five minutes before the breach.
Yeah, probably less.
the cops are coming in? - Yeah.
all right, so, look. Here's what we're gonna do.
Josh and I are gonna walk outside and give ourselves up.
no, Sam. I think we might be able -- Mike, save it.
look, this is not your call.
if there's any chance to keep you out of jail, We're gonna go for it.
I appreciate that, Sam, But I think we might be able to keep us all out of jail.
the cops don't know who they're coming in for.
remember that Parker thing in Lima?
Lima? No. No, Mike.
you know I like to roll the dice, but that's just taking it too far.
what are you guys talking about?
there was a bank heist in Lima.
supposedly, the guys who did it made themselves look like the victims and they snuck out scot-free.
if you can get Patty on our side and I can put this gun in Nick's hand, we can do the same thing.
Mike, you'd have to do a lot more than get it in his hands.
he's gonna have to be pointing that sucker.
trust me -- he's gonna be ready to shoot somebody.
Mike, you know that story's just a myth.
nobody believes they pulled it off.
then I guess we'll be the first.
Patty... This is about to be over, and I just want to let you know that I'm sorry about what happened.
I know Josh is, too.
but, you know, Nick caused all this.
you think I don't know that?
everything he told me was a lie.
I don't even want to think about the people whose lives I helped that man ruin.
it's not your fault. He fooled everybody.
that'll help me sleep tonight.
well, you know, it's not too late to do some good here.
if we work together, you and Josh can move on with your lives when this is over.
what are you saying?
well, the cops are gonna ask who the bad guy is.
I'm hoping we all have the same answer to that question.
I can tell you right now I hate Nick.
prison would be too good for that...Evil bastard.
but he didn't hold a gun to my head and keep me here.
you ask me, you should all go to jail.
you're wrong.
I did this.
not them. Me.
and I'm sorry.
I know it was wrong, and I am willing to face the consequences but I...
I just couldn't live with myself, knowing that those people were gonna lose their homes and not be able to feed their kids.
so, you're gonna point the finger at somebody, point it at me.
on your knees.
W-what are you doing?
you're a smart guy.
figure it out.
please... You can't kill me!
why not?
we found the money.
we only need one hostage to walk out of here.
we took a vote. You won.
wait! Think about it! You don't want a murder rap!
T-t-they'll never stop chasing you, and
spies are trained to follow certain procedures When holding someone at gunpoint.
stand out of arm's reach...
keep your weight on your back foot... Never take your eye off the target, unless you want your weapon taken, then you do exactly the opposite.
Sam, what are you doing?!
I told you she couldn't witness this!
back off!
everybody over there! Move!
this kind of sucks for you, doesn't it, buddy?
you and your friends are going to jail, and I'm going to Aruba.
all right, Patty, when we get outside, it's probably best you keep your mouth shut.
I can explain the cash, and if you want to get cute And mention something about a scam, there's nothing you can say I can't talk myself out of!
so, let's go.
don't be stupid, hero.
I don't think you have what it takes to shoot somebody, Nick.
are you crazy?
you're a two-bit scam artist, Nick.
you're all talk.
that's why you got into cons in the first place
so you wouldn't have to do a man's work.
you're about to make the stupidest mistake of your life. Now move.
am I wrong, Nick?
you've got the guts?
you've got the guts to pull the trigger?!
you're damn right I do!
he's crazy! Don't shoot!
No! - Give me you hands.
clear.
show me your hands.
keep your hands up. - Okay. Okay.
how'd it go with Casey?
just stuck to the story, Mike.
it's all on Patty now.
is she with us?
your guess is as good as mine, brother.
spies don't always make decisions based on training, experience, or potential success of a mission.
sometimes, it's just a matter of doing what you think is right, even if it means putting your fate in the hands of a stranger.
911. What's your emergency?
Oh, my God! He's got a gun!
please! Hurry! Please!
that's you, right?
it's okay. It's all right, Patty.
I know you've had a hard day.
look, I'm not trying to make it any harder or any longer.
I have one simple question.
why'd you make that call?
Josh Wagner came in completely out of control.
he said Nick had stolen over a million dollars from his charity and he wanted it back.
Nick denied everything.
he said Josh was crazy.
and that's when Josh pulled the gun?
no. Nick pulled the gun.
he's a liar and a thief, and he knew he was about to be exposed, so he took us hostage.
all of us.
what are you doing? Wait, wait, wait! You can't do this! I was a hostage!
I guess I should be thanking you.
according to Patty, if you and your buddy Sam hadn't been around, things could have been a lot worse.
I was just helping out a friend.
got the department's file on you. Says you have a fondness for explosives.
it just so happens I got a safe blown out of the floor in there.
that was like that when we got here.
you're telling me that Nick blew up his own safe?
maybe he forgot the combination?
I don't think I could ever find the words to thank you guys.
well, those ribs were a good start.
if you really want to thank us, call our friend Barry.
it's time you let a pro handle your finances.
I'll make sure of it.
so, Mike, uh, I guess I owe you an apology.
Why? You were right, Sam.
you said it would take less than a day.
I did, didn't I?
that's one long-ass day.
Hey, sarge, nosy neighbor from hell's a block and a half away.
Dude...You got to go lighter on the rake.
you're never gonna get the last pin.
when was the last time you did this in the field?
I'm saying window's closing, super spy. Let's go.
I'm in.
Fresh-painted walls and steam-cleaned carpets are great if you're a realtor showing a vacant apartment.
if you're a spy hoping to find a clue, there's nothing worse than a sparkling-clean home.
maybe kassar's a neat freak.
if you can't even find spare change in the sofa, chances are you won't find anything at all.
you're wasting your time.
you want to go wait in the car, be my guest, all right?
I didn't jump through all those hoops, tracking this guy down just to give up bcause you say it's a dead end.
it might not be a dead end. Spring cleaning like this takes time.
chances are somebody was seen.
you want to go talk to the neighborhood watchdog?
all right.
I'm letting you know right now, That chick is a stickler for I. D.'s.
you just happened to bring that?
I had a feeling we might need it.
I'm sorry, Agent Gordon.
I don't think I'll be of much help.
uh, you'd be surprised, miss... Kendra.
sometimes the little details make a big difference.
when's the last time you saw Mr. Kassar?
I don't know. A few days, I'd say.
and you haven't noticed any, uh, suspicious people Or unfamiliar vehicles since he's been gone?
like I said, it's been pretty quiet around here.
sorry.
thank you for your time... Kendra.
what's up?
says she doesn't know anything.
Yeah, so what's that look for?
there were pictures on the wall, but kendra wasn't in any of them.
Really?
you check out her body? It was pretty banging.
stay with me. Something's off here.
no, no, no, no. That's what I'm saying.
a woman with a physique like that doesn't cover it up to go jogging - not in this heat.
not unless she's hiding something Like scratches on her arms.
she kills Kassar, then sits on the place next door to see if anyone comes knocking.
every precaution you take to make something more secure also makes it less accessible.
concealing a high-density tape cartridge behind drywall is a great way to keep it from being found.
she got away, man.
we just blew a chance to end this thing.
but if you ever have to leave in a hurry, you can't expect to take it with you.
I don't know, Jesse. I think we're just getting started.
I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing -- no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...- Should we shoot them?
...an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.
...family, too... - Hey, is that your mom again?
...if you're desperate. - Someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line - as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
blood. Looks like somebody was dumping a body.
that would explain why he disappeared.
the dead body belongs to Jeremiah Kassar.
I hate to sound paranoid, but we had break-ins around here recently.
she kills Kassar, then sits on the place next door, to see if anyone comes knocking.
we just blew our chance to end this thing.
I don't know, Jesse. I think we're just getting started.
spies are used to battling cutting-edge encryption and billion-dollar security.
but sometimes the toughest challenge is cracking something old and out of date.
if you find yourself up against an obsolete tape drive loaded with arcane software, you can either find yourself a time machine...
or admit defeat.
14 phone calls, 7 data-recovery experts, and three hours of arm-twisting to even access this drive, and it's unreadable!
I know it's a little frustrating -- "frustrating"?
Oh, it's more than frustrating, Michael.
we're trying to track down the people that let a psychopath stick explosives in a Miami hotel!
we have nothing.
I wouldn't say it's nothing. Look
no, no! Not in the trash!
the owner of this killed our best lead, which makes her someone we should talk to.
the elusive Kendra.
you think she's just gonna give you a call?
invite you to brunch?
spies always assume they're being followed.
it could mean nothing that a route is blocked, forcing everyone to leave the building through one exit.
but when that exit is in view of a driver who's been sitting in a parked car since you walked in, that starts to mean something.
good news.
I think Kendra just found us.
gray San. Right behind you.
you think she's been sitting on this place?
she probably figured we'd have to bring the tape drive here at some point.
which we did. Still think this is a dead end?
it is if she kills us.
Aw, thanks, dear.
Hey, Mike. How's operation "Boring Tape-Drive"?
just got more interesting. Kendra's surveilling us.
Oh, everybody's favorite murderer makes a special appearance. You need help losing her?
no, we need help grabbing her, tossing her into a storage container, getting some answers.
how quick can you get over to the design district?
about a half an hour, maybe less.
you want to run her through foot traffic?
Yeah. Let's get her walking. You play lookout.
there's an alley behind the dress stores. We can grab her there.
okay. Game on. See you in 30.
that sound good to you?
all I heard was "dress stores."
you know, if I'm gonna spend the afternoon playing bait, I think you should buy me the nicest thing I see.
being hunted isn't always a bad thing.
when someone's on your tail, you can pick the route.
and if you're really good, you can lead them into a trap of your own.
Yeah. Well, there's no sign of Kendra, unless she's disguised as a fat tourist.
well, keep your eyes open. She's slick.
well, that could be our girl.
okay, Mikey, pick up the pace.
Yep. She's tailing you with reflections.
the girl's got some moves.
wonder where she got her training.
not sure, but there's something about her that bugs me.
okay, your alley's coming up.
I left a taser for you underneath a crate.
I'll bring up the rear.
okay, Mikey. All yours, any second now.
where is she?
you dropped your phone.
Oh, did I?
seems like I'm always losing things. Who are you?
I could ask you the same question. It's "Kendra," right?
that's as good a name as any.
why are you after me?
and here I was, thinking it was the other way around.
why don't you come back down so we can have a nice, little chat?
a little chat with the guy who tried to grab me in an alley?
a couple days ago, you tried to kill me.
to uch.
look, I'm willing to forgive and forget, but sooner or later, you'll want to meet up.
I have something that you want.
mm, someone's cocky. I like that.
I hope you're ready to have some fun.
so now Kendra knows you're after her?
she knew that before. And now we know that she's after us, which is an opportunity.
Yeah, it's an opportunity for one of us to end up dead.
she's probably tracking us with that phone.
right. Because I'm an amateur. I forwarded the phone to this burner.
Kendra's gonna want her tape drive back.
I'm gonna offer to let her buy it back from me.
so you're baiting a killer?
you don't have to be counter-Intel to see the risk in that.
it's the best way to get her close to us.
and when she's close, I grab her.
trust me. I've done this before.
and how are you still alive?
Michael, Jesse said you'd be dropping by.
good timing. You can meet a friend of mine.
actually, I'm a little busy.
okay. I'll tell her not to worry about the drug dealers.
this woman's in the middle of a serious situation, Mike.
you're in on this?
why do you think I asked you to come over here?
I expect this from her.
Lauren was my favorite doctor before she moved to Homestead.
her boyfriend's kind of a community leader down there.
david started the clinic last year. I volunteer down there.
this town's been hit hard with the economy.
my mom mentioned something about drug dealers.
Yeah. A couple months ago, these drug dealers showed up in town, started selling heroin right outside our front door.
can you believe that? They're slinging dope right by the clinic, man.
did you call the cops?
david called them a few times. The police show up, they arrest a drug dealer or two, but half an hour later, there's another dealer in the same spot.
Yeah, it gets worse, too.
yesterday, David was walking to his car.
these guys attacked him. They beat him up.
they said they knew he called the cops. They told him to get out of town.
but of course David's not going to do that.
I'm scared they're gonna kill him.
I'm not even sure what I'm asking here, but, um...
he'll see what he can do, hmm?
thank you for coming. Please, come on back.
I'm sorry it's so hectic here. The other clinic closed two weeks ago.
now it's... just us.
David, these are the people we were talking about.
no. Please, Lauren. I'm busy.
hello to you too.
I'm Michael. This is Jesse. This is Fiona.
I appreciate you stopping by.
but Lauren's told me all about you, and working outside the law will only make matters worse.
now, there's only one move here, and that's to keep calling the cops until the dealers go away.
correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that why they want you dead?
Yes, it is.
and trust me, I'm not trying to be a hero here, but those thugs are selling heroin all over the neighborhood.
and someone has to stand up to them, and if people around here are too afraid to call the cops themselves...
look, David, I know you think you're doing the right thing.
but having the cops drag away a few street-level dealers isn't gonna solve your problem.
all you're doing is hurting their bottom line by a couple percent.
they tried to reason with you. Next time, it'll be worse.
well, I won't be intimidated.
I've dealt with people like this before.
I've set up clinics in Brazilian favelas, villages in Uganda
and usually Miami is a little safer, but in this case...you're gonna get yourself killed.
I hope you're not paying them for this pep talk.
David, please listen to them.
they're here to solve our problem.
so, what? You just...snap your fingers and the dealers disappear?
well, it's worked before. We'll figure out something.
the point is, we'll deal with them from the outside so they don't retaliate against you or the clinic.
all right. Fine.
he seemed to really like us.
Hey, the guy's standing up for his community. It's pretty inspiring.
there's a fine line between inspiring and suicidal.
I saw we hit them hard, send a message.
guys, we don't even know who we're dealing with.
let's figure out who these guys are working with. - Fine.
just promise there will be some hitting involved at some point.
Kendra. Nice to hear from you.
first ring?
I hope you didn't stay up all night waiting for my call.
the anticipation was killing me.
imagine how special it'll be when we meet face to face.
well, I'd love to meet up, as long as you're bringing me a gift.
I don't know about a gift, but the tape drive will cost you 50 grand.
there you go -- killing the mood.
well, I'll make it up to you.
brickell Plaza, tomorrow at 4: 00.
don't be late.
someone's getting a little too flirty for his own good.
Fi, I'm trying to snatch Kendra off the street and tie her to a chair.
you are not helping your cause.
this is just a harmless game of cat and mouse between me and a professional killer!
I should scout Brickell Plaza.
think you guys can climb the dope-dealing food chain?
Yeah, yeah, we'll get Sam out here, find another corner those dealers are working, figure out who's running the show.
give me a ride home first?
take the bus, Romeo.
it's a dangerous neighborhood.
these guys are pros, Fi.
see, nobody ever touches the drugs and the money at the same time.
if we were cops, we would basically have about nothing on them.
reason number 337 I'm glad I'm not a cop.
sleazebag number one is doing his count.
you think the runner's on his way?
let's hope.
as much as I like watching a liquor store parking lot...
we doing this or what, people?
I'm the impatient one around here.
it's looking like the money's on its way.
well, it sounds like they need a new customer.
if you've ever accidentally set off an alarm at a clothing store, you know how radio-frequency tags work.
spies use lightweight rfid trackers, too.
but instead of catching shoplifters, they're able to tail their targets more effectively.
whatcha want? - Need five dimes.
Oh, it's 60 bucks.
bounce radio waves off an rfid tracker with a modified digital depth finder, and you can keep tabs on whatever you like without having to get too close.
then it's just a matter of waiting for it to move.
that's our runner.
and this is where the money goes.
well, you don't have to be an expert in body language to see that he's the one calling the shots.
running his operation out of a strip club.
classy.
still, I should probably follow him in there, Fi. This surveillance could take a while.
well, you know, there is a quicker way to get a handle on his operation.
Michael's old neighbor.
sugar? Really?
he owes us a favor.
and he obviously knows the drug scene.
I really don't like hanging out with that guy.
well, I'm calling him.
you're the one who volunteered for inside surveillance.
whatcha looking for, Sammy? Jack-and-Jills, Tachas?
no drugs, Sugar. We just want your expertise.
you know any big dope dealers in Homestead?
Nah, it's small-time down this way.
ain't no real ballers South of 142nd.
yeah? There might be one now.
Oh, no, man.
what kind of malfeasance you got me mixed up in here?
that dude's psychotic. He gives dealers a bad name.
sounds like you know him.
Vince Cutler. Everybody in the game knows him.
he came down from the Bronx, and now he's spreading through Dade County like the plague.
a couple years back, in Hialeah, he shot my friend Carl.
he'd have shot me too, but I swore I'd stay out of his business forever.
and now I'm hanging in his strip joint. Thanks, Sammy. This is suicide.
this is a public place, Sugar. You're okay.
you don't get it. He's been cozying up to some Mexican cartels.
they fronted him a huge stash. Now he's got to pay them back.
ain't nobody scarier than somebody trying to move up
wait, wait. Wait a second.
how do you know that, about his stash?
everybody knows, man. He's a heavy hitter.
you need more reasons why we got to get the hell up out of here?
wait, Sugar. Wait, wait. Hang on. Wait a second.
working in the field often demands making tough decisions.
yo, grab him.
but if you have to choose between letting someone get killed...
is that Sugar?
or getting beat up as a distraction...
yo!
yo yourself! Hey, you owe me a drink!
move out of my way. - I'll move out of your way when you buy me another drink.
I didn't ask for a lap dance!
you should thank me for letting you walk out of here.
okay. Thank you.
...you pick the bruised ribs...
every time.
right. Yeah. Hey. Point taken.
nothing distracts someone like rage, although getting someone really angry can be risky.
man, you should have left when you had the chance!
Yeah, you want some?
thought I'd introduce myself to the head honcho.
Oh, and how'd that go?
worst surveillance ever.
this is insane! I can't let you turn this place into a fortress!
sorry, David -- from now on, everyone comes and goes through the front door so we can keep an eye on things.
is that -- no, please do not bring a gun in here.
I thought you were just gonna tell the dealers to go away.
we're not gonna get rid of them that easily.
this guy, Cutler, has to pay back his supplier.
they need to run the corners 24/7.
so they'll never leave?
not without a good reason.
but we'll give them a good reason.
they took a huge amount of heroin from the cartel.
they need to sell it to pay off the debt.
so we need to find his supply, take it, and he'll be running from some very angry Mexicans.
so you're gonna steal his drugs?
well, that sounds even crazier than calling the police.
David, think of it this way.
the police are kind of like this bandage here.
they mostly just cover up the problem.
we're more like...
this.
so how do you plan to find where this guy hides his drugs?
we're gonna give him something else to hide.
and what do you have that a drug dealer needs to hide?
we need some Fentanyl. Do you know any veterinarians?
I'm not sure if my head is throbbing from the cut or the prospect of spending more time with Sugar.
you'll know soon. He's here.
Hey, what's up, boys?
I'm on the team, bro.
we're going after Cutler's stash. We need a little more help.
Cutler? Hey, was I, like, not clear before?
because I think I remember saying something about staying away from that dude before Sammy here got wrecked.
I wouldn't consider this "wrecked,"and stop calling me Sammy.
I'm just saying, I'm with you guys. I owe you.
my word is bond... except for this time.
relax, Sugar. You're not getting anywhere near Cutler again.
thank you.
now, if there's anything else I can do for you guys
I just need you to make a few phone calls.
call your buddies up north and tell them to remember working with me.
I got to vouch for you?
how about instead I get you guys some fine-ass Cuban cigars?
you guys like Cubans?
okay. I'll make some calls.
spies spend so much time thinking through operations from every angle that occasionally they get too clever for their own good.
sometimes, you're better off keeping things simple.
if a drug dealer is looking to get rich, there's no better approach than offering him a great deal on drugs.
I heard you'll be running this town soon.
I figured I would speed up the clock and get to say I knew you when.
I got no idea who you think I am. I'm just here to watch the girls, not trying to make friends.
I got enough friends. I'm here to talk business. Hold on...
I could be sitting anywhere in the world right now.
but I'm sitting here next to you. Do you know why?
cause you and I, we have a lot in common. We're a perfect fit.
just gonna hit you with one word
one word
fentanyl.
you spiking your punch with it?
this is neither the time nor the place
don't answer. I already know you're not.
you'd have a nicer watch.
Hol-- hey, hold on. Hold on.
you want to live in the '90s, be my guest.
wait. If you want to deal your junk, you want to chase some tail, you want to enjoy the small time,
I'll find somebody else to make rich.
but if you want to make your stuff 10 times stronger with my synthetic painkiller, you won't find a better product for a better price.
all right.
so, what? You, uh... You in wholesale?
Yeah, I was shipping pharmaceutical-grade Fentanyl to D. C.
dealer up there -- his junk's so strong, he could barely pocket all the cash.
fool got shot at a dogfight. Now, all of a sudden, I'm a supplier without a demander.
Yeah, well, I can be demanding.
okay, then. Okay.
show me your stuff. I check its purity.
I show you how to lace it.
but I don't work with walk-ins from out of nowhere.
well, of course I'm a walk-in. We haven't -- we don't know each other.
let me get your digits. Let's swap.
go.
Yeah, you got a cute, little song and dance.
but just 'cause you shake your stuff in my face don't mean I'm gonna pull out my wallet.
I'll tell you what --you do your thing, you find out who I am...
and you call me.
hit me on the hip when you want to move to the champagne room.
Cutler like your pitch?
just enough to call Sugar's contacts in D. C.
it'll give us a little time to focus on this Kendra business.
speaking of -- love the new look.
Ah, thanks. It's my assassin-snatching costume.
so, Mike, uh, you really think Kendra's coming here to make a deal?
50 grand is 50 grand, and bullets are cheap.
she won't kill me until she knows I'm holding her tape drive.
and she won't get the chance before Sammy the mall cop picks her up for shoplifting.
if she resists, zap her.
I'm betting she's gonna resist.
Kendra. You're late.
I'm watching you right now.
I thought this was gonna be a face-to-face.
why don't you come down here? The smoothies are great.
no, thanks. I don't get within kissing distance until I really trust someone.
all right. How about this?
I'll leave the tape drive here.
you leave my money there. I'll take the stairs, you take the escalator, we both head home happy.
no. I don't like meeting-places that you select and scout.
who knows what little traps you've set?
Oh, Kendra, just when we were getting to know each other.
I'll call you later to set up another meet.
and next time... I pick the place.
Yeah, Sam?
sorry, man. She slipped away.
she's playing hard-to-get. We'll grab her next time.
there's gonna be a next time? Oh, goody.
Hey, some kids just stole some DVDs from my store.
yeah? That's a shame. Good luck with that.
mom? What are you
I just talked to Lauren. She said that y-you and Fiona are bringing guns into the clinic!
it was that, or shut it down for a while.
and David wouldn't agree to have it shut down.
the community needs that clinic, Michael. The whole point is to keep it open.
no, the whole point is to make sure it doesn't turn into a morgue.
fine, maybe we should have just bought them two bus tickets.
I'm not the one running them out of town. Please do not smoke in here.
Lauren is my friend. I wanted you to help them.
and now they're more scared a-a-and upset than ever.
not to mention the fact that David pretty much hates you.
I can't care about that right now, and it doesn't change anything.
I'm fighting for him, whether he likes it or not.
now, just tell Lauren to tell him I'm one of the good guys.
Mr. Cutler. Good to hear from you.
had words with your friends up north. Let's see if your product's as good as they say it is.
well, the next time somebody complains about my drugs...
will be the first. Now, where is your place?
I got somewhere better to meet.
there's a spot on the edge of town.
take the Redland exit.
mass quantities of illegal drugs can be hard to get your hands on, but it's even harder to come by drugs regulated by the government
manufactured, distributed, and sold under lock and key.
even drug dealers recognize their value.
it's Mr. Song and Dance.
Oh, please.
my father's Mr. Song and Dance. Kyle. Call me Kyle.
you got a racetrack hook-up or something?
something. What you got there is pure, regulated, pharmaceutical-grade.
somebody's got to give the junkies what they love, right? Am I right?
now, there's a pretty spot that you've picked. We should probably get moving.
I'll show you how to cut this into your smack.
Nah. My guys will figure that out.
Oh, what are you gonna do? You gonna reinvent the wheel?
I hope you enjoy wasting five K of the product playing "amateur chemist."
I guess my privacy's worth five K.
your stuff better pan out, or, uh...
gun. Right. Let's do lunch. Talk soon.
get that over to the stash house.
I don't think they've spotted me.
sure not doing anything to lose me.
beginning to think these drug dealers aren't too bright.
or they know something we don't.
don't stress, Westen. I got this.
all right, we must be getting close now.
it's turned into a residential neighborhood West of Seventh.
give them some space, Jesse.
trust me. I've done this before.
damn it. I just got cut off.
trapped. The S. U.V. got away.
don't worry about the S. U.V. Get out of there now.
cops use checkpoints to catch drunk drivers.
drug dealers use them to catch people who don't belong in their neighborhood.
yo, you know this dude?
no.
who the hell are you?
um, I'm taking a shortcut to my girlfriend's place.
is that so?
Yeah. Is this Seventh Street or Seventh Avenue? - Get out of the car.
now.
Hey, man.
look, can I ask you something?
what did you say?
I said,"why do you want to lose your teeth?
making a getaway is often more about precise handling than raw horsepower.
so in a hostile situation, rear-wheel drive is a nice advantage.
that said, it doesn't hurt to have over 300 horsepower at your fingertips.
when did this happen?
late last night.
after David and I locked up, they fired into the clinic.
they tossed this in.
some people from the neighborhood are starting to get scared off.
I told them not to give up, that I'll organize a meeting
people in the neighborhood have the right idea.
we need to board this place up, close it down, at least
no, no. I-I don't think you get it.
look.
Mr. Heyneker -- he comes in for heart monitoring.
Mrs. Rodriguez -- she needs her physical therapy every day.
we'll figure something out.
I thought you had a plan!
you said you were gonna find Cutler's drugs!
we're close -- we found the neighborhood where he keeps his drugs, just not the house.
and until we close up his business, it's not safe here.
well, all I can say is, work faster.
because I'm not closing this place!
let go of me! - You can thank me later.
it's just a few nights, David.
you know, it might not seem like we're helping you
you kidnapped me! - We're keeping you alive.
now, if anybody needs medical help
this isn't about just providing medical help.
people count on that place.
I-it's practically a Community Center.
parents let their kids hang out in the waiting room after school because they know it's safe.
well, it's not safe now. You're putting people in danger.
please.
there's iced tea in the fridge!
unless you want a permanent roommate, we better hurry up and find Cutler's stash house.
you really think this'll work, huh?
beats getting shot at.
aerial recon is invaluable in modern warfare if you need to scope out a place that's too dangerous to visit on foot.
using a homemade drone is almost as good as rerouting a spy satellite.
outfit a remote-controlled plane with an infrared camera, and you can get a good look at your target from above.
install an engine-cut-off switch, and no one will even hear you coming.
Sam, I think the camera's too heavy.
uh, or maybe you're just not a natural at everything, Mikey.
let me show you how to do it.
come on. Here we go. Wait. Here we go. Wait.
see, you got to hold -- w-wait a second.
there. Whoa, where are you going? Where are you going?
well, you're worse than I am.
well, it's a little windy.
well... What do you expect? - Ease off the throttle.
you think you can do better, kid?
Yeah!
we should enlist that kid in the Air Force.
age limits be damned.
why are some of these pictures...Just of the sky?
Oh, he was showing off. He was doing some loop-the-loops.
he's kind of a smug, little brat.
how about this one?
check out this cluster of guys.
I'm betting that's the stash house.
perfect. We'll pay them a visit bright and early, first thing.
Sam, you think you can get your hands on a delivery truck?
well, I've run down Interpol files, fabricated fake I. D.s, hacked into phone records.
Yeah, I think I can get my hands on a delivery truck.
Kendra. I've missed you.
how sweet.
you free tomorrow afternoon?
sure.
well, the weather's been so nice lately, I was thinking we could do something outdoors.
why do I get the feeling that this is going to be a sticking point?
bring my tape drive to the old dock at the Sunrise Bay Marina, 4:00 pm.
and all kidding aside, come alone, unarmed, or I'll be looking for a place to hide your corpse.
delightful.
we got one more shot at Kendra, but you won't like her conditions.
I don't like that there are conditions, period.
I wish our phone conversations were as flirty.
she threatened to kill me. - I can do that.
why don't we give David the good news instead?
can't let you do it. - Let me go now!
do not go anywhere, all right? Lis-- David, listen to me.
get your hands off me!
Michael, I tried to call you. Do something!
what's going on? - He's trying to slip out the back.
we talked about this, David.
they're going after the clinic.
Cutler? - Yes.
what's happening?
there's this patient -- a local kid. He's epileptic.
he needed his neurontonin, so Lauren had to sneak in.
now, I told her to be careful, but one of the drug dealers saw her.
where is she now? - Oh, she's safe.
but one of my neighbors called me. Cutler and his guys are telling people that they're hitting the clinic to send us a message.
Michael, you should call the police. - Lauren already did.
but a patrol car driving by every 20 minutes isn't gonna stop Cutler.
you don't let him out of your sight. We're going to the clinic.
No! I'll go with you!
David. - No.
let him take care of it, all right?
did you people not get the message?!
cause I told my boys to send you a message!
it should have been relayed to you! You're closed down!
the clinic's closed!
someone's off his meds.
this is my town! You understand me?!
where are the cops?
maybe they're tired of answering David's calls.
no one gets in my way!
we have sniper rifles. Let's stop them.
you snitch!
you're gonna pay the consequences!
if we intervene, he'll know something's up.
our best chance is
no one goes against me!
never mind.
let's clarify that point for these mother
what the hell?! Where's it coming from?!
let's just get out of here!
I know you keep them from burning the place down. And I appreciate it. I do.
but you can't guard it around the clock.
maybe we can just...
David, we don't need a new plan.
in a couple of days, you'll be fixing up the clinic
Why? So Cutler can hit it again?
not if he's beaten within an inch of his life.
Cutler was asking for war -- let's give it to him.
no, Fi's right -- enough of this "sneaking around" crap.
my only question is, do we hit his club or his stash house?
look, we must stick to the plan.
Cutler tried to torch the clinic, Michael.
I'd like for him to suffer a little.
guys, we need to be smart here.
confronting Cutler isn't -- Michael, I need to talk to you.
not now, ma. - Right now.
excuse me.
mom, if you have a plan for handling violent heroin dealers,
I am all ears.
do you remember when you and Nate were in middle school together and there was t-that bully, Todd, who was always picking on Nate?
I really don't have time for this right now.
well, you went over to Todd's house, and you told him, if he messed with your little brother, then he was messing with you.
and it worked.
Todd left Nate alone for the rest of the year.
inspiring story. Listen, mom...
Yeah, until the next year, when you went off to high school.
and then Nate was fair game, Michael.
Todd and a bunch of those punks made his life miserable.
I don't remember that.
that's because he never told you, Michael.
anyway, that's not what solved the problem.
okay.
one day, Nate had had enough.
and he whacked Todd with a 2x4.
of course...He was suspended from school for a week.
but after that, everybody left him alone.
and you know why? Cause he stood up for himself!
mom, David isn't up against middle-school bullies.
these people will kill him.
I don't think that you're gonna let that happen.
either you're with us or you're not, but we're hitting Cutler back.
no, we are not.
David's going to be the one who stands up to Cutler.
we're just gonna give him a little help.
okay. All aboard.
so, this truck will get them past the checkpoint?
Yep. You good? - Yeah.
another bag.
what is this -- every explosive you own?
huh. You don't know me very well.
okay. I'll deliver our special guests.
you putting Cutler on high alert?
Yeah, and assuming he requires a little demonstration, you mind paying the corner boys a visit?
not at all.
I thought you said I was standing up to Cutler myself.
trust me, the spotlight will be on you.
look, David, I am no fan of sending an untrained man into danger.
so you got to promise me that you'll follow the playbook here.
I-I won't use a gun.
but otherwise, I'll do whatever it takes.
good. Now, to really sell this, it's gonna have to look like you beat me up.
now, you're probably gonna object to punching me in the face, so, Sam, do y
one more time?
Yeah, just not quite as hard.
hold on. Hold on.
I --there you are! I have been calling you and calling you!
what the hell are you doing here? I told you I'd contact you.
he shot two of my guys.
in cold blood, like it was nothing. Now he is coming after your stash.
get the hell out of here.
who are you talking about? - This guy David.
he runs a clinic around here.
what? Nah, he's nothing. He's nobody. Trust me.
no, no, no, no. I found out he was after me, so I looked him up.
turns out he runs with these mercs or something.
what? - He used to run black ops with these dudes!
all around the globe!
no, no, you're wrong.
he was on "helping kids" crap in South America, in Africa.
he wasn't just helping kids!
he's Ex-Delta Force, man!
what the hell?
so, why the hell is this guy running a clinic? Huh?
I don't know. Maybe he was taking a break from all of the killing!
you know, and you just had to piss him off, didn't you?
you know, your corner boys -- they're probably already dead.
what the hell are you talking about?
Hello?
Hello?!
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, everything's copacetic?
well, I'm doubling back now, man, but I'm telling you, I was just there, and everything is copacetic.
yo, we just got hit!
son of a bitch!
What?! Hello?!
Hello?!
someone shot at us outside that clinic yesterday!
did this guy, this David guy -- did he follow you here?
huh?! Did he follow you here?!
you're not listening to me.
he is coming after you and your stash!
after my stash?!
we got to get out of town!
no, you run! I'm not running!
round everybody up! I'm gonna end this thing!
come on! Let's go!
all right. Get down there. Get over there.
I'm in position. Got a great angle on the stash house.
I'm covering our boy Cutler. He is in battle mode.
okay, now it's all on David.
look alive. There's no room for error.
so, how's David with public speaking?
you guys consider this "public speaking"?
sending someone untrained into a combat situation is like dropping your kid off on his first day of school.
you give as much advice as you can, you watch from a distance...
...and you cross your fingers that he comes back in one piece.
what the hell do you think you're doing here?
come on, David.
I'm here to tell you to leave town.
all I wanted was to run my clinic.
I just wanted to live in peace for once, stop hurting people...
even if they deserve to get hurt.
okay, Jesse. Smoke 'em out.
you think you're running stuff now, huh?
I didn't want to do this...
but you forced my hand.
what was that?
you ready, Fi?
am I ready?
you think you're gonna run me out of town with tear gas?!
no.
what the hell was that?!
just waste him.
tell me where your guys are, and I promise I'll kill you quickly.
my guys? They're everywhere.
now you have to decide
are you gonna leave town...
or are you gonna stay and face the consequences?
I got a consequence for you.
where is he?
now it's your turn to think. - Cutler, let's just go, man.
I'll give you to "three.
one...
two...
...three!
bingo.
you made up your mind?
you're crazy! You gonna kill us all?!
not if you leave.
now!
now!
that's how we do it, people!
looks like everyone's happy to have their clinic back.
Yeah.
and they aren't afraid anymore.
I can't imagine more drug dealers moving in.
well, they wouldn't want to mess with this guy.
Cutler left town last night.
I'm not sure if he's more scared of you or the Mexican cartel he has no way of paying back.
I know we didn't always see eye to eye, but you saved us.
we helped out a little.
take care of these people, all right?
I'll do my best.
Bye.
thank you.
see? Sometimes people need to fight their own battles.
mom, I got it the first time.
still, it's better to have Michael Westen than a 2x4.
Oh great. Tons of hiding places, completely abandoned.
this place is a tactical nightmare.
you got to get Kendra on the phone. Give her a rain check.
if I want to get close enough to grab her, I got to meet her on her terms.
might as well be today.
just listen to what you're saying for a second.
this lady makes corpses.
she didn't tell you to come unarmed and alone because she's shy.
I'll be okay. I brought this.
I reinforced it with a half an inch of metal siding.
it's not a gun, but -- It's certainly not a gun.
just sit back here and cover me as best you can.
from this far away? You better not leave my sight, bucko.
do you have butterflies? I have butterflies.
I'd rather have my $50, 000.
soon enough.
care to show me what's in your briefcase?
a girl's got to be safe.
Aw, damn it, Mikey.
you're killing me, here.
I showed you mine.
your money's here.
what? Do I make you nervous?
$50, 000. Unmarked, unsequenced.
it's never a nice surprise when someone pulls out a concealed blade.
but there's an upside to getting a look at their weapon.
if they're using a Japanese Tanto knife, they'd rather stab you than slice you, and you can use that to your advantage.
why does it feel like we're breaking up?
sorry. I'm a heart-breaker.
okay, buddy. Play time's over.
won't be easy to crack this gal, Mike.
she's gonna make our life hard.
well, we're just gonna have to make her life harder.
I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing -- no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am i? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...- Should we shoot them?
...an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.
...family, too... - Hey, is that your mom again?
...if you're desperate. - Someone needs your help, michael.
bottom line - as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
interrogating a hostile prisoner is a little like proposing marriage
you want to get it right on the first try.
so you don't settle until you find the perfect spot.
you take special care to create the right ambience and set the mood...
...and then you wait for the best moment to pop the question.
let's go.
what? We said 48 hours, man.
it's been 48 hours, 17 seconds.
I'm sick of waiting. Let's go.
do you know how many months I spent trying to link assassinations in Chile to bombings in Hamburg to bank accounts in Switzerland?
I finally get one lead -- Kendra in there strangled him to death!
I kind of want to know why. Let's go.
so do I, but that's not a girl scout in there.
Kendra's a trained operative.
you can't just go in there huffing and -- she tried to put a knife through your heart, Michael.
do you want to go in there and play it cool?
not exactly. I thought...
listen -- we don't know anything about this woman other than she likes to wear tight pants and dump bodies from the wheel wells of planes.
all right? We got to break her from scratch.
fear up" -- that is the only technique on the menu.
if I could finish a thought... It's not about what we know.
it's about what she knows.
she knows that we're not government.
that means we're private. That means we can sell her as an uncooperative prisoner.
you're talking about a rendition play?
I was trying to.
okay. Delta's had some success with that in Afghanistan.
Yeah. I know.
I hope you listen better in there.
just follow my lead.
there he is.
I'm glad you came back.
I was getting so lonely.
and look -- you brought a friend.
let's start with something easy.
who... Do you work for?
Where's your stuff?
you're only gonna get so many chances to answer my questions, so pay attention.
I get where you're going with the whole vibe here, but you need a cart with some scary pliers and a saw.
stuff like that.
is that what you want?
just tell me who you work for.
I'll give you a hint.
I don't work for that guy. - Oh, that much I know.
I had a nice, little chat with his Serbian pals.
they perked right up when I told them I was holding the woman who killed their weapons supplier.
pretty sure they have one of those carts you like with all the tools.
so, what? I answer your questions, or...?
I get paid, and you answer theirs.
feel like giving them a call?
the threat of rendition is usually more persuasive than the fear of immediate torture.
for prisoners who want to believe that they've hit rock bottom, the idea that their circumstances could get even worse is a powerful motivator.
it's kind of like the grass always being greener, only in reverse.
one last chance, Kendra. Who do you work for?
you know, one time I did an interrogation with some Eastern Europeans.
they like to start at the feet and work their up way up.
but even if they made it all the way to my head, say, like... this...
...I think I could handle it.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that I could handle it.
okay. That's enough. That's enough. Stop.
Aw, you're just adorable. Thank you. So sweet. - Outside! Now!
what the hell was that?!
one of us had to stop her from scrambling her brains!
I know. You did the right thing.
what? No. - Yeah. I know. I know. I know I did.
so w-why did -- rendition only works when the bad cop isn't in the room.
she invited him in and kicked him in the teeth.
our play was dead. We needed a new one. Now we've got it.
we don't have a damn thing!
that woman is a predator.
she's overconfident around people she thinks of as prey.
you're the prey, Jesse.
so I'm the... I'm the weak link. I'm the guy with the bosses breathing down his neck.
that's what I was trying to tee up.
okay. All right, but look...
if we make the soft play, it is just me in that room from now on, okay?
I got to be out on an island by myself. That's the only way this can possibly work.
I know. And this better work.
you want me to what?
you know, back Jesse up.
okay. Mike, you lied to me. You brought me here under false pretenses.
I am now officially eating my lunch and drinking my beer in protest.
noted. But I didn't lie to you.
I said I needed your help, which is true.
Yeah, but I thought that meant I was gonna interrogate Kendra.
since when am I the back-up guy?
Jesse's got to come off like a weak underling.
he needs an unseen boss from hell.
he needs your booming baritone rattling the walls.
the dulcet tones of Sam Axe, huh?
Mike, you think this is the smart play?
I mean, this is not gonna be easy for Jesse to pull off.
I know. That's why I need you in there.
Jesse's new. He can't do it alone. I need you to supervise and play hard-ass.
okay. I'm in.
but if Jesse doesn't break her, the big dog gets to eat. More.
Oh, just so long as the big dog is happy.
Michael, shall we?
so, where are you two lovebirds off to? Hot date?
uh, job referral.
big-money gig. Some guy, a friend of a friend, makes knock-off handbags.
he's in some kind of trouble.
needs us to bail him out.
I'll swing by as soon as I can. Hopefully this won't take too long.
Oh, yeah. It never does.
don't let him slip you any wooden nickels.
sorry about the mess.
these were all supposed to be in Vegas last week.
there are just so many!
Yeah.
those would look great on you.
Oh, take 'em. I have hundreds of them.
I forge high-end luxury goods.
every bit as delicious as the real thing -- slice of the price.
it's my motto. - Do these come in blue?
so, Buddy, how about you tell us why we're here.
well, I-I'm pretty sure that the client on my last job...is trying to kill me.
so I needed a, uh... Special-strike-force- commando team, which is what I heard you guys were.
what's this?
that's my last job -- two little onyx lion heads and a piece of tooled leather.
I have no idea what it's for, but t-the guy offered 20 grand...
uh, 5 up front and 15 on delivery.
20 grand? For this? - Yeah.
sorry.
who's the guy?
H-honestly... don't know.
h-he never left a name. Uh, we never met in public.
uh, he used one of those voice-scrambler thingies.
so, just a couple red flags.
it gets worse. Let me show you.
I came out here for a little celebratory soak, and, uh, I damn-near zapped myself into the next life.
he electrified my Jacuzzi.
and you didn't think to call the police? Attempted murder usually interests them.
what was I gonna tell them?
that I was almost the victim of a hot-tub assassination attempt?
I mean, it looked like an accident.
Plus, I-I-I got an allergy to cops. That's why I called you.
buddy, uh, I don't think we can really help you.
Oh, I-if it's about the money... y-you can name your own price.
I know that this guy is gonna come back and kill me, and I-I don't have anyone else to go to.
don't worry, Buddy. We're gonna help.
you will? - Yeah.
Oh, thank God!
thank you so much!
you mentioned that when he called, he had a voice scrambler
did you get a number?
I-I did better than that.
I, uh, greased a woman at the phone company with some Jimmy Choo knock-offs, and she, um, what you may call it...uh... triangulated where the calls came from.
then I went and bought this little honey.
so I thought, you know, we could go and catch the guy together.
why don't you just give us the address, and we'll take it from there.
well, for someone who wires hot tubs to kill people, I can see the appeal of an abandoned machine shop.
those doors are reinforced steel.
either I get 20 minutes of quiet time or we come back with a blow torch.
looks like someone has been here recently.
Fi, I got an antenna on the roof.
well, look what I got -- a security camera.
okay. Let's slowly and casually move away.
he might not have seen our approach from...
I think he saw us.
I'm gonna call 911.
Oh, how very civic-minded of you, Michael.
you don't guard a roomful of belt grinders and band saws with a bomb.
something in there is worth finding, and it won't be around much longer if that fire doesn't get put out.
well, Fire-and-Rescue's not gonna let you just waltz right in there, Michael!
one problem at a time, Fi.
okay. Let's go.
Mike was gonna try and swing by. I guess he got caught up.
it's all good, man. Doing our thing.
so, if you don't mind... - Right. Yeah. With great pleasure.
were my instructions too complicated for you to understand?!
do I need to speak in single-syllable words, maybe draw you a picture?!
now quit playing nice! Get in there and get me some damn answers!!
sorry, man. You got a little cut over there.
every interrogation is a struggle between two parties for control.
but when forward progress depends on you giving up this control, you have to be careful.
an overt show of weakness is transparent.
bluffing strength and allowing that bluff to get called creates a believable fiction that lets the person across the table think they actually have something on you.
okay... I need to know who hired you to kill this man,
I need to know why, and I need to know right now.
someone's needy.
you feeling the pressure to perform in here?
look, I just need -- I mean, I want you
you know what I think?
I think your bosses are pushing you too hard, expecting too much from you.
I didn't strap you to that chair so we could talk about me, all right?
how many do you have, by the way? Bosses, I mean.
I've counted two so far.
I really hope they don't all treat you like trash.
just answer my damn questions.
honey, where did they find you?
I'm never going to answer your questions.
but... I think it's cute that you haven't realized that by now.
who hired you?!
that feel good?
let it out?
let me ask you something.
what happens if you don't bring this in?
that's what I thought.
we can help each other here.
no. No, I'm not authorized to make any kind of decisions.
no, I'm sure you're not.
but there's no harm in hearing me out.
lean in. Come on.
I'm not gonna bite.
I just want this conversation to be between us.
how about I give you something, you give me something?
what do you say?
what do you want?
I did the math.
I know I don't leave this room.
that's life.
but what's killing me... is not knowing who'll be killing me.
what, you want to know who we are?
all right, yeah.
okay, fine.
but I'm not going first. You go first. - Fair enough.
this guy?
he was a pay job.
I punch a clock, just like you.
except I punch a little harder.
Okay...Lover.
your turn.
all right.
I work for a private company, okay?
Yeah, Sam. How's Jesse doing?
well, the kid's good.
he got Kendra to admit that she's a cleaner by baiting her into going after who he works for.
okay, whoa. What's going on over there? Are you in a presidential motorcade or something?
no, I had to call Fire-and-Rescue.
that doesn't sound good.
I got it under control, but I got to go.
I got to get in there before everything gets washed away.
keep the car running. We might have to leave in a hurry.
are you sure you don't want to tag-team this?
I'm really good at getting what I want from firefighters.
bureaucracy is a spy's best friend.
the overlap between city, county, and state emergency response creates confusion that can be exploited at a crime scene.
if you wander in off the street and claim jurisdiction, you buy time by wrapping yourself in red tape.
you there. Who are you?
Hey, Carter. We worked that mess two months back on the interstate.
you have lost some weight! - Who's Carter? I'm McKenzie.
I've never seen you before in my life.
Really? Oh, I must have mixed up.
uh, county arson investigators unit.
county? No. This is a city thing. This is my scene.
uh, if that were true, why would I be here? Didn't one of the boys call you?
who? - Any one of them.
just call over county office.
tell them Randy with an "R" is here, and they'll fill you in.
damn it.
this is just what I need.
what's it look like in there...Randy?
one big barbecue.
I got a chubby man with a gray beard making a call, Michael.
you don't have much time.
there's a lump of plastic that used to be a laptop.
somebody definitely set up shop here.
I got a resin mold here.
looks like the guy tried to destroy it before he took off.
if it's important, grab it and go. The clock is ticking.
buddy didn't know what the little lion heads he'd made were for.
well, I just found what they fit into.
chubby gray beard is off his phone and headed your way, Michael.
county has no record of rolling units to this fire.
who are you with, again?
Carter, you need to get your men back.
I have toxic material here.
what are you talking about?
I need to get this sample to a lab right now!
Randy, put the bucket down. I need to see some I. D.
Carter, do you want to be responsible when everyone starts dropping from radiation sickness?!
I need this to get to a lab right now!
everyone, back! Everyone, just stand back!
sorry, Carter! I'll call you!
you know, from the lab, which is where I'm going!
he fire-bombed his own place.
what's he gonna do to me?
I thought you guys were gonna get all super-squad-action-team and fix this.
things got a little messy, but we turned a bad situation into a lead.
this is a mold for a replica of a sword that belonged to Alexander the Great.
you see this?
this is where your onyx lion heads fit in.
that's... fascinating?
b-but not quite the same thing as catching the lunatic who's trying to kill me.
we're getting to that, Buddy.
this is where we're gonna catch him.
at a party for a software company?
Ken Bocklage, the C. E.O. just bought the sword at auction.
he's putting it on display at a new product-launch party this Saturday.
after that, it goes into their vault.
Saturday is the thief's only chance to get to the sword and steal it.
and when he makes his move, we'll be there to catch him.
how?
I mean, we don't even know what he looks like.
there aren't a ton of thieves who can move stolen antiquities. It's a pretty small world.
we have a friend looking into our mystery man's M. O.
we're hoping Interpol has a file.
uh...you're hoping?
have a little faith, Buddy.
boy, it is nice to be outside again.
you know, next time we have to interrogate someone, I say we do it at the beach.
I'll keep that in mind, Sam.
how's Jesse doing with Kendra?
slow and steady, but the kid's made some progress... As did I, on your antiquities thief.
it turns out that swapping in fakes is just not that common.
there's only two guys working that like to do it that way.
this is only one file, Sam.
right, that's cause the other guy is doing life in some Russian hole for stealing a Czar's furry hat.
no name or photo?
sorry, Mike. No one's even seen the guy.
the French police call the guy "Monsieur Glissant."
Ah,"Mr. Slippery." That's cute.
they should call him "Monsieur Psycho," cause when he couldn't get away clean in Kyoto, he got away violent.
blew up an elevator in a museum.
guy's got a real passion for making things go kaboom.
suspected of seven heists on three continents, and now he brought his traveling act to Miami.
if we're gonna make this his swan song and save Buddy's life, we need to go see Ken Bocklage, let him know he needs to hire some extra security to protect his sword.
Oh, I do look good in black.
what's next, Selena?
I believe we're next, Mr. Bocklage.
Scott Miller. We're private security consultants. We need a moment of your time.
that's not how this works.
you need to call me and make an appointment, okay?
sir, we have a video conference -- Mr. Bocklage, you're about to be robbed.
am I?
would you care to elaborate?
you just bought one of Alexander the Great's swords.
a thief is coming to relieve you of it.
we've been hunting this man since he hit a client of ours in Mumbai.
who? Who were you working for?
we're not at liberty to say.
but this thief stole some very valuable Indonesian artifacts from our client and ruined our reputation, and we're here to get both back.
I need you to know that I don't have a sense of humor.
if this is a joke -- this is a mold the thief made for the Alexander sword.
we recovered it from a structure fire in Miami.
we're not wasting your time -- someone in your company is going to steal your sword and swap in a fake.
now hold on just a damn minute.
you're saying that I hired a thief?
he didn't make a forgery because he's planning an armed robbery.
he clearly has the access he needs to swap it and walk it out the door.
but he can't do that if you let us identify him.
we'll need to see your employment files -- absolutely not.
we're not handing over confidential employee records to people we don't know.
I appreciate your assistant's concerns -- you mean my head of security's concerns.
they're my concerns, as well.
I'm not just hiring a couple of people who wander in off the street.
you have a file, some wild claims, but you have no proof.
far as I'm concerned, you could be two thieves working on some con.
Selena, let's set up that video conference in my office now.
you heard the man, Michael. He doesn't want to hire us.
maybe we should turn in a rsum at the H. R. Department anyway, see if we can't change his mind.
23 seconds. Not exactly a record.
keep your eye out for this woman.
what an adorable family photo.
this will take only a minute, okay?
less talking. More stealing.
for a spy in a rush to steal large computer files quickly, file-sharing sites are a dream come true.
file sharing has none of the drawbacks of e-mail.
there are no size limitations on uploads, no waiting for files to bounce through multiple servers, and no electronic trail leading back to the account on the receiving end.
the only drawback is, whatever you post can be seen by anyone in the world.
but since nearly every visitor to these sites is busy trolling for illegal-music and -movie downloads, chances are good no one will think twice about whatever boring intelligence you've left there.
excuse me.
I'm here to interview for the, uh, secretary position.
no, you're not.
Yes, I am.
I-I came all the way from Fort Lauderdale.
I guess telling time isn't one of your professional skills.
you're obviously too disorganized to hack it at this company.
did you just throw that at me?!
no, it was an accident.
and you're gonna lie to my face?
I'm calling security.
no, wait, wait, wait. Wait. I-I did it. I-I did it.
I-I should just go now.
now I should go.
this behavior is truly bizarre.
look at it this way -- you'll have a great story to tell Mr. Mittens and Patches when you go home.
I'm telling you, Fi -- Andrew Deans is our guy.
three new hires in the last year, and you go right for the guy with the spotless record.
a little too spotless. Perfect performance reviews, perfect credit reports.
even the best employees raise some red flags.
deans is working awfully hard to fly under the radar.
there's got to be a reason.
well, he's hiding something.
