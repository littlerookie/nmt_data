google's acquisition also illustrates the second difference between the markets for pcs and mobile devices: the latter will be more vertically integrated.
google's acquisition of hardware giantmotorolamobility, which it bought for$ 12.5 billion in may, put the mountain view, calif., company at odds with its erstwhile partner apple.
google's actions had harmed the eponymous garment company of which he was chairman as well as the many other people in china who shared his name, mr guo claimed in his letter.
google's advancements are welcome for experimental applications, and developers building applications for the chrome app store, but their impact on the wider web will probably be negligible, since cross-browser implementation is considered so important by many organisations.
google's advantage lies in its massive cloud scale and innovation in browser-based apps.
google's aim is to organise the world's information and democratise access to it.
google's always had an eye toward aesthetics, even if it sometimes goes astray.
google's ambition to hire the brightest computer minds also echoes microsoft.
google's analysis showed, for example, that searches for paul mccartney surged when the former beatle played hey jude during the opening ceremony, and the largest proportion of these searches came from smart phones, rather than desktop computers.

google's android division has been developing home-entertainment devices, and in recent years it has worked closely with hardware manufacturers to build android-powered smartphones and tablets under the nexus brand that google has sold through its website.
google's android market is not pre-installed on many android devices shipped through official channels in china.
google's android mobile operating system has found an unlikely source of support in china in spite of the internet search giant's recent threat to pull out of the country hundreds of small "grey-market" chinese phonemakers which are now trying to become legitimate manufacturers of more advanced devices.
google's android operating system is driving a bunch of devices that compete with apple.
google's android os already powers a wide variety of devices from rival manufacturers, many of them aimed at such consumers.
google's android os has outgrown the company's patent portfolio and the other industry titans are now taking aim at google in the courtroom.
google's android system, for instance, allows anyone to write and distribute software without permission.
google's app, on the other hand, takes up almost no space on the phone because everything is in the cloud.
google's approach comes with special obstacles.
google's assault comes when the once almighty software giant is vulnerable.
google's automated driver system has the potential to become the operating standard for every car in the world--the windows of motor vehicles.
