Chechen groups, always fractious, fragmented and became uncontrollable.
Chechen is looking for money...
Chechen president ramzan kadyrov, who has been in office since 2007, has brought a measure of peace and even relative economic prosperity to the state, although he has been accused of numerous human rights abuses.
Chechen separatists in 2006 on the site issued a statement declaring umarov became president of the illegal regime in chechnya.
Chechens didn't do this.
Chechens felt little obligation to the soviet state.
chechnya is a southwestern russian republic, in the caucasus mountains region.
chechnya is still part of russia, and any other would-be secessionists have seen the bloody price the chechens have paid: perhaps 1 00000 civilians dead, and many more displaced.
chechnya itself has been relatively calm in recent years under the thumb of the local strongman ramzan kadyrov, installed by mr putin as chechen president in 2007.
chechnya was thus a factor in the first big skirmish of another of mr putin's campaigns, against media freedom.
chechnya, balkans, estonia. Same.
chechnya, dagestan's neighbour, is still convalescing from a decade of civil war fought between radical separatists and federal troops which destroyed much of the republic.
chechnya, somalia, cambodia.

tweetmeme has not been sitting still with other refinements and features either.
it will start on october thirty-first.
it will start selling to new arrivals packs containing linen, cutlery, detergents and everything a new student might need.
it will start swinging wildly...
it will start the warm part of its mission with the remaining working instruments within weeks.
it will start to advertise ovi in 2009, but it will not be easy to create a brand that can rival the coolness of apple's iphone or google's new mobile-phone software, called android.
it will start, baby.
it will stay that way until someone wins the cup
it will stay that way until someone wins the cup
it will stay up even if its motors stop.
it will steal life and create relational difficulties.
and there we start drinking. There were four bottles of wine...

he glanced around at his friend reading the letter and saw the books on the table. Into his eyes leaped a wistfulness and a yearning as promptly as the yearning leaps into the eyes of a starving man at sight of food.
he glanced around the room.
he glanced around the table.
he glanced at her and continued chanting.

he glanced at my shoulder bag. "George morrison recorded everything," he said, and stood up. He rapped his knuckles against his wall calendar.
he glanced at sonny corleone and tom hagen to indicate that he did not wish to speak before them.
he glanced at the desk and was struck by how impersonal it was, how bare the surface was. A lamp, a corded telephone that colleen's mother could have used when she herself was a teenager, a coffee cup with a few pens and pencils in it.
he glanced at the headlines.
he glanced at the man sitting at a table opposite them and raised his eyebrows toward the door of the bathroom.

he glanced furtively at the stolid faces of the two detectives.
he glanced his eye down the list of the books.
he glanced over his shoulder and saw me watching him.
he glanced over his shoulder to make sure that there was nobody listening.
he glanced over his shoulder, but the wall was a sickly peach color of aunt petunia's choosing: there was nothing blue there for the mirror to reflect.
he glanced over the letter he had just received.
he glanced round to confirm that he was alone.
he glanced through the provincial news, then placed the paper on the tea table and asked: "when does your school start its winter vacation?"

he gloried in his triumph.
he gloried in his victory.
he gloried in his winning the championship.
he gloried in working for a good cause.
he gloved the ball, turned and threw in one motion.
he glowered and glared, but she steadfastly refused to look his way.
he glowered at me but said nothing.
he glowered-his fists and arms, though green, looked solid enough.
he glued it to the desk.
he glued it, just like the others.
he glued it.
he glued many envelops yesterday.
he glued the hole.
he glues himself to his books.
he glues his eyes to the show window.
he glutted himself with rich rood.
he gnawed sticks and straws.

tweets can become self-promoting or worse.
tweets can originate from text-messaging on a cellphone or even blogging software.
tweets in search results will now show who has retweeted them or have listed them as their favorites, twitter said in a blog post.
tweets, mobile-phone alerts and gossipy television shows (there are five, up from three in 2000) provide much more timely information about the lives of the beautiful than do magazines.
Tweetthe biggest employer and taxpayer in the region of seine-et-marne is disneyland paris, which opened in 1992, amid howls from french intellectuals about a "cultural chernobyl."
Tweetwhatyouspend is invaluable for anyone who wants to start cutting back costs because it shines a light on what you're spending the most money on and helps you figure out where you can make cuts.
Tweetwhatyouspend takes the fuelfrog concept and applies it to everything you buy.
