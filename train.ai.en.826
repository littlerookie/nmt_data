are you sure? It's a big job, and the boss is kind nutty.
I love a challenge.
now can I get your insurance information?
so...
how are you doing?
what's this? Genuine concern?
no asking if my breasts feel swollen or if it's a heavy flow day?
I know I was dismissive before, and I want to apologize.
I read the pamphlet, and it actually made sense.
becoming a new dad at your age can be pretty scary.
I mean, just looking at that little girl and knowing you might not be around for her wedding...
is this supposed to be helping me?
I'm saying it's real, and I get it.
and now in order to demonstrate that I am a loving and caring wife, I have two options.
one, we can have a long, sensitive conversation about your feelings, or option two...
as much I like option two,
I think tonight...
I wanna talk.
Oh.
you got it.
what... what's that?
I got you a little something.
Oh.
try it on.
Paul...
this isn't... really my style.
let me be the judge of that.
we talked about this. You said we could take it slow.
it's been almost a week. Isn't that slow enough?
try it. Maybe it'll put you in the mood.
it won't. - Come on.
Paul, no.
how could you possibly think I would wear something like this?
what are those?
the letters you sent me in prison.
Oh.
read this.
Paul, please don't get upset... - Out loud.
I long for you to kiss my neck, to whisper in my ear while you unbutton my blouse.
go on.
and then make love to me...
all night long.
did you write these?
it was a fantasy.
I never thought it would be real. - It is real.
Paul, please... - we're married now. What did you expect?
I thought you would stay in prison.
I didn't mean that.
I'm sorry.
it's not a surprise to me that you have some issues.
I mean, you married a man in prison for murder.
clearly, you are a disturbed young woman.
the good news is,
I'm willing to help you.
all I ask in return is for a little affection.
do you think you can offer me that?
I'll try.
good.
I'm a patient man, Beth.
but just so we're clear,
I won't be patient forever.
don't worry. I cleaned the pot.
the way things have been going lately,
I'm not as worried about taste as I am poisoned.
look, what you did was borderline evil.
but you were right to make me talk to Tom, so I thank you for being a good friend, and don't ever do it again.
you're welcome.
you know, when I don't feel like killing you,
I think I like having you around.
good to know since I just rented the most charming bungalow right here on Wisteria Lane.
you're kidding.
Edie's old house?
wow, that is so...
wonderful?
close.
um, I... I'm trying to calm the baby, but apparently I don't have the right equipment.
did you hear the big news?
Renee is moving in just a stone throw away from us.
you do know that's just an expression, right?
we'll see.
do you really think it's a good idea for you to move here?
of course. It'll be a nice, fresh start.
plus I can be close to my dear friend.
it's just, um...
I wanna be sure... - Tom, that was a million years ago.
it doesn't matter. She can never know what happened between us.
have you seen my wife?
Yeah, she's in the cafeteria. Oh, while I've got you, could I have you sign these release forms?
then you'll be able to take Juanita home.
what's this torn page on her chart?
let's just say your wife has a bit of a temper.
what happened?
well, it's not really my place, but she did have a strong reaction when I told her your daughter's blood type.
Gaby did this?
I need you to tell me exactly what happened.
Oh, crap.
Gaby, come back here!
it's not my fault! I have a disorder!
Gaby, we have to talk! - Damn it! Aah!
Gaby!
see you in about two seconds. Okay, here's what happened.
it was on that ski weekend eight years ago.
I don't normally go for French guys, - but you know how I get when I drink too much champagne. - What?
well, I didn't think I slept with him, but I must have, because why else would our daughter have type-A blood?
you're not killing me. Why aren't you killing me?
baby, come with me.
there's something I have to tell you.
there are certain kinds of pain that can't be treated in a hospital, so those who are suffering do what they can to heal themselves.
some cure the ache of loneliness by making new friends.
some soothe their excruciating guilt with an infusion of cash.
some alleviate their burning desire with small acts of kindness.
but sadly, there will always be those who can't begin to heal...
because they realize there is more pain yet to come.
Susan showed a certain flair for her new job.
there you go.
you know, you're getting good at this.
Renee rented a house.
wow, that is so...
wonderful? - Close.
there's something I have to tell you.
Gaby learned the truth about her daughter being switched at birth.
paul Young continued to surprise everyone.
well, I see you've all met my wife.
and Tom came home with a mysterious affliction.
I'm not feeling well. - Again?
I'm just gonna lie on the couch and watch some TV.
Tom Scavo was depressed, and his wife had done everything she could to cheer him up.
she had made his favorite meals.
she had told her funniest jokes.
she'd even worn her sexiest lingerie.
but nothing worked.
finally, Lynette insisted her husband go to the doctor.
unfortunately, what he came home with was a prescription... for trouble.
antianxiety medication?
this is what he gave you?
Dr. Weiler says it will help.
he spent 20 minutes with you. - Lynette...
and let me guess. Did he write this with a pen that has the drug company's name on it?
I need this medicine.
then take it, but I gotta tell ya, those drugs scare the crap out of me.
I gotta do something. I am so tired of feeling this way.
but you've gone through rough patches before.
you could come out of it.
so wait around to get better? That's your answer?
you don't know what it's like inside my head!
okay, you're right. I'm sorry.
remember when Susan kept having all those headaches?
who was that guy that she went to? Doctor... Dr. Ross.
how is he gonna be any different?
he's holistic. He tries to stay away from heavy meds.
Susan loved him.
and if he says I should be on this?
then you have a second opinion.
whatever he says, I'll go with it.
well...
I saw Dr. Ross.
Oh! I'm so glad.
did you like him?
loved him. And you were right.
he... he doesn't believe in pharmaceuticals.
he only prescribes stuff that's totally herbal and natural.
that is fantastic. So what did he suggest?
medical marijuana.
Yes, Tom Scavo had been battling depression, but he was now facing a much bigger battle with his wife.
happiness...
it's something we all want, and so we search for it.
little girls find it in the taste of chocolate.
well-dressed men discover it at their local mall.
teenage boys experience it when talking to a pretty girl.
and then there are housewives, who simply can't be happy until they've learned everything they can about the newest neighbor on the block.
Hello!
Hi. So sorry to interrupt. This will just take a second.
we wanted to officially welcome you to the neighborhood.
this is my friend Lynette and Susan, and I was telling them about you, and we...
just had to meet you. - Immediately.
that's so sweet. Oh, you... you're my landlady, right?
Yes, but I really want you to think of me as a friend.
are those pictures hung on the wall with nails or...
um, we wanted to invite you to our weekly poker game.
shoot. I don't know how to play poker.
Oh, don't worry. We'll teach you.
does that ficus tree have a saucer underneath?
because those are hardwood floors.
and while you're learning all about Texas Hold'em, we'll learn all about you.
Aw! That sounds fun.
okay, well, uh, we should be going. We'll see you later.
okay. Bye. - Bye.
what did those women want?
they invited me to play cards with them.
but they were just being friendly.
on this street, never confuse being nosy with being friendly.
they were digging for dirt.
so... Do you not want me to go?
no, no. You will go.
give them all sorts of meaningless information.
and hopefully, they'll start to think of you as a friend.
but... if you don't like them, why do you want me to be friends with them?
in time, it will be useful.
Where's the pen?
don't you wanna read it first?
Why? Did a nurse get drunk and swap it with a different document?
by signing this, Mr. Solis, you are agreeing not to bring any legal action against this hospital. Do you understand?
and in return, you'll stop searching for the other family.
do you understand?
done. Gaby.
babe, we talked about this.
we don't know how this other family will react, and we need to protect Juanita.
I am sorry, Gabrielle.
I can only imagine how you must feel.
you can't begin to imagine how I feel.
the only person who could is the woman who has my daughter.
if signing can spare her this pain... Then I will do it.
I love it!
somehow I get the feeling you don't love it.
okay, I-I don't love it. It's just so... Yellow.
trust me. This will be great.
besides, when you're in the room, nobody's looking at the walls anyway.
well, you certainly know how to sell yellow.
excuse me.
I hear you're gettin' divorced.
and good morning to you.
I'm getting divorced, too, so we both need guys.
I'm thinking we should hang.
uh, I don't know how much Lynette has told you about me, but I'm really not one for... hanging.
look, one woman at a bar is just sad.
but two, and it's girls' night out.
so what do you say? You up for a little stud hunting?
that's a lovely offer, but I think I'm gonna pass.
Oh, come on.
we gotta get back in the game, cut loose, let our hair down.
that hair does come down, doesn't it?
really, Renee, that is just not how I like to meet men.
well, how else you gonna meet 'em, sittin' around your house?
you'd be surprised.
you've met someone already? - Maybe.
a beautiful, classy woman who can get a man without leaving the house.
I don't see us being friends.
I don't know how everything gets so dirty in here.
is that a piece of lint?
Oh, no! It got my apron!
I'd better sign off before I'm completely naked.
see you tomorrow, boys.
I'm busy!
honey, it's Maxine!
a star is born!
did you watch?
Oh, not only did I watch, I kvelled.
Oh! I have to admit, I am sort of getting into it.
that whole thing with the vacuum just came to m well, that's how it happens with the great ones.
here's a bonus for you.
what's this for?
well, it's a little something I do for the girl who gets the most hits in a month.
you just unseated Stacy Strauss, and with the caboose on her, that's not easy.
Oh, Maxine. You're so good to me. - Oh, honey.
you know what? Mike and I are finally starting to save some money.
well, don't save it all.
buy yourself something nice. You deserve it.
Oh, by the way, have you decided what you're gonna do for tomorrow's show?
I'm gonna damp mop in bikini briefs.
Ooh! Are you trying to make me cry?
Bye, doll.
this is a great sandwich. What's in it?
Oh, it's nothing.
and of course I make my own fig mustard.
cooking is a passion of mine.
of course, it's not much fun cooking for one, so, um, if you're free this weekend...
babe, you gotta try this sandwich. It rocks.
this is my boss, Mrs. Van De Kamp.
this is Stephanie, my girlfriend.
you have a girlfriend?
of course you have a...
a girlfriend who's young and pretty.
nice to meet you.
I'm sorry, Bree. What were you about to ask me?
Oh, it's, uh, wasn't important.
you enjoy your sandwich.
inside, over there.
let the stud hunt begin.
come on. Come on. We're gonna get started.
you okay?
Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Let's play cards.
when I was 8, daddy left mama, and we were pretty much alone.
most of my friends were either stuffed or plastic.
of course, there were always mama's boyfriends, but as soon as I'd learn their names, mama would kick them out, and there'd be a new toothbrush in the bathroom.
uh, l-let me know if I'm sharing too much.
no. Not at all.
keep pouring the chardonnay. She's cracking like an egg.
okay, quarter ante.
so, Beth, how did you and Paul meet anyway?
Oh, I don't wanna bore you.
we won't be bored. More chardonnay?
well...
I saw his picture in the paper during his trial, and there was just something about those eyes that spoke to me.
what about the headline?
arrested for murder - that didn't speak to you?
I'll admit that gave me pause.
but then we started corresponding, and I discovered what a wonderful man Paul really is.
Bree, let's forget about hittin' the clubs tomorrow night.
clearly, all the best guys are on death row.
but, hey, you can't help who you fall in love with, right?
and Paul's a real lady-killer.
we... we always fogged up the plexiglas with that one.
well, it's good that you can laugh about it.
the thing is, in my heart, I always knew he was innocent, and I was right.
well, he is.
Yeah, so let's play cards.
what are you doing?
preparing to take my medicine.
I've heard that an increase in appetite's a possible side effect, so I'm taking the necessary precautions.
necessary precautions being your own weight in cheese doodles?
I never smoked pot before, so I wanna be prepared.
headphones? - Pink Floyd.
apparently, it complements the medicinal properties of, uh...
blueberry bliss.
listen to you. You are loving this.
Tom the college rd gets to finally smoke pot and be cool.
Hey, I was plenty cool in college.
the only reason I didn't smoke back then was because I signed the abstinence pledge with my dungeons & dragons club.
so... what do you say?
care to join me out back behind the garage for a little doobage?
"Doobage"?
that's what you're calling your medicine now?
come on. You need to take this seriously.
I-I am.
Really? 'Cause I'm pretty sure I've never asked you to join me behind the garage to split a midol.
Lynette, you said you would go with this.
I know, but how is it gonna look to the kids?
I don't want them seeing their dad stoned.
Oh, you... you don't have to worry about them seeing me stoned.
they'll never know.
Hey, the...
okay.
so what do you wanna do Saturday night?
well, I was thinking that we could go to Chez Naomi.
isn't our price range more Chez chicken hut?
Mike, it's our anniversary.
besides, we've been working really hard. We deserve it.
okay, but bring your big purse 'cause we're taking the dinner rolls home.
so... Chez Naomi, huh?
expensive place.
Yeah. Yeah, I guess it is.
must be nice.
um, have we met? I'm in 1b. Susan Delfino.
Oh, I know who you are.
I'm 1f.
uh, y-you're one of Maxine's... - Yeah.
Oh, well, it's nice to meet you.
guess we... Kind of do the same thing.
Oh, sometimes we do exactly the same thing.
what does that mean?
I keep an eye on the competition. You lifted one of my moves.
no, I didn't.
you expect me to believe you just woke up one day and decided to put a feather duster in your mouth?
you do that?
it's my signature bit, and you stole it.
I swear. I...
I-I don't watch the other girls perform.
okay, so I guess it's just a coincidence.
well, here's another coincidence...
you're getting the big bonus check, and I'm not.
that's not... really what you'd call a coincidence.
that's really more - all right, college.
just keep the duster out of your mouth.
and watch your back.
everything okay?
Oh, yeah.
I am wasted.
Really?
I am Lucy in the sky high.
so...
this must be pretty intense for you and don't forget.
tomorrow we have to trombone 3-d banana patch. Remember?
man, this is, uh, really strong stuff.
snow shovel.
exactly.
you know, I was just upstairs watching Paige sleep, with her little fingers and her little toes.
I-I must've watched her for, like, an hour.
she's just so perfect.
and I am so lucky.
I couldn't feel happier than I do right now.
I mean just so happy it's working.
Yeah.
what do you think? Does this say "happy anniversary, Mike. I'll love you forever"?
no. I think it says "credit card declined."
aren't you and Mike on a budget?
Yeah, but things are starting to turn around lately.
I've been selling a lot of my jewelry.
get out!
out there and keep selling.
Oh, hello, Silk!
Oh, how I've missed your soft touch.
I'm going to the dressing room.
mm, you two have fun.
mommy?
Oh. You're not my mommy.
are you lost, sweetie? What's your name?
Kiki! You scared me! I couldn't find you.
I have a little girl, too.
sometimes they get distracted and wander off.
let's go.
wait!
how old is she? - 8.
my daughter's 8.
when's your birthday? - Uh, we've really gotta go.
uh, okay, but, uh, what hospital was she born in?
was it Fairview memorial?
standing there in the mall, it just hit me.
I can't spend the rest of my life wondering if every little girl I see is my daughter.
not knowing where she is, it... it's like my heart living outside of my body.
well, there's a private Detective I work with.
but Sanchez is a pretty common name.
it's not surprising the hospital couldn't find 'em.
but I know something the hospital doesn't.
when I was in labor, the other woman's mother came into my room by mistake, and we got to talking.
she lived in El Paso, and she was so excited to have her granddaughter baptized at Santa Maria's church.
that's gonna help.
so you think you can find her?
we'll do our best. Carlos is on board with this, right?
Absolutely.
okay, then give me ten porterhouse.
Hey. I just came by to pick up my envelope for the week.
okay. Inside.
and don't listen to this conversation.
it's about your Christmas gift.
I'm buying all my girls steaks. You got a preference?
whatever meat you put in my stocking will be fine.
Ooh, that sounds dirty. Use that.
I'm back. What else have you got for me?
rib eye? I like it.
is that a piece of lint?
that's my bit. Max... Maxine!
What?! I'm on with the meat guy.
Yeah, but Stacy Strauss is stealing my vacuum bit!
Oh, my God.
well, if she's gonna do that, at least teach her how to use the nozzle.
hey there. I'm ready to party.
are you? 'Cause you look like you're ready to tour the Reagan library.
this is a cocktail cardigan.
look closely. The buttons are shiny.
Where's your closet?
I have never seen so many sweater sets.
are you sure this is a closet and not a portal to the 1950s?
there is nothing wrong with my clothing.
Bree, you're going to a hot young club full of hot young people.
you need to dress the part.
well, I happen to find it distasteful when mutton is dressed as lamb.
look, when women go out clubbing, there's two ways they can pair up...
pretty girl/pretty girl or pretty girl/Grenade.
which do you wanna be?
fine.
now we're getting somewhere.
love the plunging neckline.
that's the back.
Ugh. This place is dead.
Really? - I forgot we were in the sticks.
clearly, everyone hooked up early so they could be home in time for "nightline."
actually, tonight's "nightline" sounds very interesting.
it's about the genocide in r...
hold on. Fresh talent at the end of the bar.
Oh, that's my contractor.
well, call me a fixer-upper.
Oh, don't... don't bother.
he's, uh, got a girlfriend.
if I don't see her, she doesn't exist.
what's so funny?
my girlfriend's about to make a fool of herself.
she's hitting on that guy, and I happen to know he has a very beautiful, very young girlfriend.
you talking about Keith? - You know him?
Yeah, and Stephanie dumped him this afternoon, which is why he's here, drowning his sorrows.
Bree. Wow. I didn't recognize you.
Keith, what a lovely surprise. I didn't know you were here.
Yeah.
but I'm bagging. I gotta work tomorrow.
boss is pretty strict.
good. I mean, yes, I'm very strict.
see you in the morning.
there ya go. That's how you bait the hook.
Oh, I won't need a ride. I'm going home with Keith.
Oh, I don't think so. He just left.
Oh, he's pulling the car around.
now you think I should play the "I hate going into a dark house alone" card, or the more blatant "I'm not wearing underwear"? 'Cause I'm not.
okay, before you do anything hasty, he just broke up with his girlfriend.
he's very fragile.
Oh. I'll be careful when I unwrap him.
Renee, wait. Please don't go home with Keith.
Why?
Oh, he's the one you like, isn't he?
I am... I am thinking about you.
you don't want to come off like a slut.
Aw, gee, then chip won't ask me to the prom.
Renee, wait! What about me?
Oh, it's getting late. Stay in the dim light and don't play hard to get.
Keith, hi. It's Bree.
I-I don't know if you're in bed yet, but I'm having a bit of an emergency.
Oh, thank you. That's lovely.
why would somebody do something like this?
far be it from me to understand the minds of hooligans.
I'm so sorry to call you over here at this hour.
Oh, it's okay. I wasn't doing anything special.
good. I would love to show my appreciation.
I was wondering if perhaps one night this week, I could make you dinner.
Oh. You mean... Like a date?
well, we don't have to put a label on it.
just two adults eating... Food together.
calling it a date is quicker.
well, I see no reason to argue.
shall we say...
00 P. M. on Thursday?
M-Mrs. McCluskey, right?
Yeah.
I was hoping I might see you at the girls' poker game.
not anymore.
you get caught with a couple of aces in your bra, and you're banned for life.
I-I couldn't help but notice they don't seem to like my husband very much.
do you know why that is?
Nope. Nobody tells me anything.
Mrs. McCluskey, I really need to know.
okay, fine. They think he's a murderer.
but he was exonerated. Felicia Tillman framed him.
Yeah, for that crime.
what do you mean?
before Felicia showed up around here, her sister Martha was murdered.
and, all due respect, you're shacking up with suspect number one.
does everybody think that?
Felicia may be a few fingers short of a high five, but if she's crazy, we all are.
well, that's enough dusting for today, boys.
I guess all that's left is a little vacuuming.
Ooh! Yay! Get the vacuum.
I think I got some schmutz on my apron.
Ooh, get that off.
Oh, I love this show.
Hello, boys.
for those of you who might be switching over from other channels, welcome.
I have a very dirty apartment.
open up!
uh, little busy!
I know you did it.
did what?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, so you're not just a thief. You're a liar.
be careful how you talk to me, you gigantic freak.
Oh, I am about to slap that cheap blush right off your face.
is that supposed to scare me, man hands?
I'm gonna show you a whole new place to stick that feather duster.
well, I'm sure wherever it is, you copied the idea from watching me.
I need those bonus checks! - So do I!
you don't get it. I am trying to get out of this business!
Oh, and you think I wanna spend the rest of my life dusting in my underwear? !
you're off camera! Roll left.
Oh, Maxine. I'm so glad you're here.
what are you doing? - She attacked me.
that's because she broke into my apartment and...
hang on. This isn't a bit?
No! I was in the middle of doing my show, and she burst in here and started hitting me.
did you do that?
Yeah, but... - you know the rules, Strauss!
you never, ever interrupt a show!
now go to your room.
but I... - I said go.
you all right, honey?
Yeah. - All right. Good.
I-I gotta call tech support.
you girls had so many hits, it fried my router.
so...
a roving gang of hooligans destroyed your sprinklers?
shameful, isn't it? - You know what I think?
I think this is the hairwork of a lonely, desperate woman.
you left out "resourceful."
nobody steals a man out of my bed.
but you know what?
I've been looking for a new hobby, and taking you down is as good as any.
I think you'd be wise to stick to your original hobby of forgoing undergarments.
be seeing you, Bree.
looking forward to it.
Maxine says I can't go back online until I apologize to you, so...
I apologize.
and I thought your acting was bad on the web site.
fine. I am sorry, okay?
I shouldn't have stolen your bit.
what was going through your mind?
I freaked out when I didn't get that bonus check.
see, my family's in Virginia, and I'm saving up to move back home.
Yeah, well, I know what that's like.
and even with that extra money,
I always feel like I'm living week to week.
Really?
cause when I broke in your apartment,
I noticed that you had some awfully nice stuff.
flat screen TV, closet full of new clothes.
I know.
probably shouldn't have bought all that.
but you know how it is.
every once in a while, you want a little splurge.
Yeah, I get that.
but... definitely by the end of the year,
I'm going to be outta here.
me, too.
how long have you been doing this?
um... gosh.
I guess I'm going on six years.
would you mind if we just stayed home and ordered Chinese for our anniversary?
wait. No suit? No tie?
no pretentious euro waiter listing specials that I can't understand?
dang it, Susan! Why?
seriously, why'd you change your mind? I thought you wanted a little treat.
I think we should save that money and stay focused on what we're trying to do.
and we can have a fancy dinner and celebrate when we move back home.
I had a lovely time at the poker game the other day.
Really? What's the neighborhood saying about me?
well...
for starters, a lot of people seem to think you killed...
what's her name? Martha something.
I guess Felicia Tillman spread her poison pretty wide.
I guess she did.
I'm not a murderer, you know.
I know.
but I fell in love with you before I knew that, so even if you were...
I'm always gonna be on your side.
remember that.
everything okay? You... You look a little...
it's been an intense couple weeks.
I'm sorry, buddy.
what if I told you I could ease some of that stress?
you're not gonna offer me a back rub, are you?
Nope.
a mind rub.
so you got this from a doctor?
really cool doctor.
now I gotta warn you, this stuff is chronic.
I got totally baked off of it this morning.
I did not have you pegged as a stoner.
dude...
there's a lot that you don't know about me.
Tom? - Yeah.
I hate to break this to you, but...
this isn't pot.
tell me that in five minutes when we are soaring past the rings of Saturn.
trust me, cheech. This is oregano.
no way. I bo... I bo-- I bought it at a legit dispensary.
then somebody must have switched it on you, 'cause the only thing getting baked with that herb is lasagna.
who would do that?
you! - Oh, jeez. You scared me.
I know what you did.
whatever do you mean?
Oh, yeah. That was me.
th-this isn't funny, Lynette!
Tom, you thought you were getting stoned on a pizza topping.
it's a little funny.
my sense of betrayal is huge at this moment.
well, why don't you snort some baking powder? You'll feel better.
I'm glad you're enjoying this.
glad you enjoy making a fool of me.
that was not my intention.
I only threw out the pot because I didn't think you needed it, and you know, I was right.
you got happy all on your own.
don't try to justify what you did by making it seem like some sort of "master plan.
it wasn't a master plan.
I lucked out because for some reason, while you were...
high on oregano, you made a decision to live in the moment.
you stood over our daughter's crib and you let go of the stress and the fear, and you focused on the good in your life.
but I am sorry I tricked you.
you're evil. I should have expected it.
where are you going?
to look at our beautiful daughter.
then I gotta turn that bong I made back into a lamp.
anything?
we found them.
Oh, my God. What'd they say?
I haven't called them yet. Are you sure you still wanna do this?
what? Yes, of course.
Gaby, you need to realize, once we call these people, and they know what's happened, it'll change your family forever.
call them.
Juanita, come in here.
I didn't do it.
I know. I was putting on some ketchup.
I thought you might like some.
can you put the big fake eyelashes on me?
of course, and... big rosy cheeks.
look how grown-up you are.
before you know it, you're gonna be going to college, have boyfriends, get married.
I'm not getting married.
I don't wanna leave you and daddy... ever.
do you know how much I love you?
to the moon and back.
that's right.
no matter what happens, I will always love you to the moon and back.
Hey, Carlos, I need to sit down with you and Gaby.
Why?
I just called the family. It got pretty intense.
what are you talking about?
and now in a selection from Dior's fall line, the world's newest supermodel... Juanita!
hold the world in contempt.
that's it. Now you look like a model.
Oh, hi, daddy.
Hey, Carlos. What's wrong?
I just spoke to Bob.
sweetie, why don't you go to your room? And I'll be there in a sec.
how could you have done this? - Carlos...
we talked about this! We agreed.
no, you agreed.
you rushed me into signing that piece of paper without giving me a chance to think about what I was doing.
don't you understand what could happen?
she is our flesh and blood, and she's out there!
I need to know how she's doing. I need to know she's okay!
and what if they want Juanita back?!
they can take her from us. They can do that now!
they're not gonna wanna give up their own daughter.
we don't know that!
we don't know anything about them!
and you have no idea what you've started here!
mommy!
coming, sweetie!
if this ends badly, I will never forgive you.
I mean it, Gabrielle. We're done.
happiness...
it's something everyone searches for.
some are sure they'll find it once they've moved back home.
some think they'll find it by making a new friend.
some hope to find it once they've defeated the competition.
then there are those who stop searching for happiness because they look up one day to discover...
it was right there in front of them all the time.
Keith moved in with Bree.
Susan came to grips with her future.
dialysis until they find me a donor.
well, that won't take very long, will it? - Three to five years.
in grief over losing her biological daughter...
grace no longer exists, and that is the last time you will mention her name in this house!
Gaby sought comfort from an unusual source.
and there were some surprises... - Somebody lose a gun?
including a long lost son...
you didn't mention your mother-in-law. - My mother-in-law?
and a shocking revelation for Paul.
Felicia Tillman has gone to some extraordinary lengths to cause you harm.
paul Young had made a discovery...
his wife was a liar.
she had lied with every smile, with every caress, and with every kiss.
Yes, Paul now knew their entire marriage was a fraud.
the only thing he didn't know...
hey , there.
was how he would punish her.
you're packing?
I thought you weren't coming home until tomorrow.
I talked the doctor into letting me out early.
I'm glad. I really need you right now.
things on the street have been getting very strange.
Beth, things on that street have always been very strange.
well, yes, but...
remember I told you how Bree was inviting me over - for drinks with the other women? - And I told you not to go.
well, I should've listened.
turns out they're trying to frame me.
frame you?
while I was there, I found a gun under my sofa cushion.
it was a .38...
the same caliber the police said you were shot with.
they must've planted it there.
and the gun just magically appeared? - Yes.
I'm sure Bree's going to turn it over to the police, and they're going to think I shot you.
Beth...
you don't have to worry about what anyone else thinks.
I know the truth.
Hey, here's an idea.
why don't we take a trip?
a trip?
we need to get away.
we'll go somewhere... secluded.
Ohh.
that sounds like heaven.
yes...
paul had no choice but to punish his wife...
I love you.
because some lies... are unforgiveable.
we are reminded every spring... with every rose that blooms, with every sunflower blossoms, with every lily that buds, the world is a beautiful place.
sadly, it is filled with people who do ugly things...constantly.
that woman who just drove away... who was she?
uh... A friend.
you're friends with Barbara Fairchild, the interior designer?
Bob?
or should I say, the inferior designer?
Hey, Renee.
how could you hire Barbara Fairchild when you know I just started my own interior design firm?
uh... We're not hiring her.
Oh? Why you holding swatches?
and people think you're the smart one.
look, you know we just adopted a little girl.
well, we hired Barbara to decorate her room.
well, why not hire me? - You're not exactly maternal.
we...we wanted this room to be pink and nurturing, and your style seems more like chrome and glass and teeth。
look who's back to being the smart one.
look, Fairchild is a hack，whatever she quoted you.
I'll come in 2 days eariler and 20% cheaper.
Barbara is kind of expensive. - Done.
I'll get started right away.
just so you know, our daughter gets here in a week.
and just so you know, I'm as maternal as the next woman.
Gaby?
Hi, honey. You want some lunch?
no, I want an explanation. I just got our credit card bill.
$840 at "Miss Charlotte's Doll Academy"?
did I say lunch?
I meant sex. Do you want some sex?
why are you buying our kids fancy toys?
last week, Juanita used her doll's leg to scrape peanut butter out of the jar.
okay, the doll wasn't for Juanita.
it's for Bob and Lee, for the little girl they're adopting.
you spent $800 on a gift?
it made me feel good, okay? For the first time in weeks, I'm not staying in bed till 2: 00 in the afternoon or staying up all night sobbing.
so I went a little crazy on the credit card.
just let me be happy. - But $800?!
Carlos, if you get this worked up now, you'll have no place to go when the bill for the platinum card comes in.
uh, excuse me? Hi.
I'm looking for Keith Watson.
his roommate told me he moved here.
uh, yes, but he's not available at the moment.
can I give him a message, Miss...
sorry. I'm Amber James.
I just need to talk to him about something.
it's kind of important.
well, I would be happy to tell him what it's regarding if you... tell me... what it's regarding.
we're just... old friends.
I'm at the Fairview Motor Inn. Could you ask him to come by?
why exactly would he be doing that?
you're kind of a nosy landlady, aren't you?
I'm not his landlady. I'm his girlfriend.
so he lives here with you？
Yes.
Yeah, of... of course he does.
of course he does.
are you all right?
um, yeah, I'm fine.
you know what? Don't even, uh, don't even tell him I came by.
there's no message. Sorry to disturb you.
okay, you're all set.
the dialysis will take six hours.
if you need anything, just hit the call button. - Will do.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm Susan.
it's my first time in here.
Dick.
sounds like you've been coming here for a while.
four years.
any tips for a newbie?
like, which nurse has the shakes or where do they hide the good painkillers?
look, nothing personal, but I don't want to be your dialysis buddy.
I wanna sit here and play scrabble on my phone while this... while this machine washes my blood.
so you don't want to talk or be friendly or keep each other company?
sad, isn't it?
you know, Dick...
sometimes when I meet people, they say, "You don't seem like a Susan.
but you...
why are you putting out those ugly candlesticks?
Oh. Who gave them to me?
Yay! Grandma's coming.
Yep, and your brother just pulled up with her.
this could be your last chance to run screaming from the room.
Why? I love grandma.
I do, too, sweetie. It's just...
I can only take her in small doses, and unfortunately, your grandma doesn't come in small doses.
Hey!
easy over the threshold! You're not transporting meat.
okay, grandma, enjoy your visit.
she's going back in a cab.
mom! Hi!
Oh!
Oh, my gosh! What happened to your foot?
Oh, I... I broke it a month ago. Uh, thanks for checking in.
Oh, I'm sorry. We've just been so busy, and...
penny, look, your grandma's here.
give her a kiss.
Hey, look at you. You're getting buds!
Aw.
be thankful she didn't yell it to you as you were getting on the bus.
so... Uh, what's new?
well... Actually, um, I started an interior design business.
do you remember my friend Renee?
I'm getting married.
what? Married?
to who?
Frank kaminski.
we met in water aerobics at the retirement community.
only man in the pool. I was lucky to get him.
this is kind of a shock.
I didn't even know you were dating.
so... When's the wedding?
Saturday.
this saturday?
uh, and you're just telling me now?
well, maybe if you visited - more often. - More often. I know.
I know. So...
do I get to meet him?
I mean, if you're going to make this kind of commitment...
what? You wanna make sure his intentions are honorable?
Lynette, I hate to break this to you.
I am not a virgin.
mom... I want to meet him.
all right, come by tomorrow, and we'll squeeze you in between "Nothing to do" and "Waiting for death.
are you all right? - What?
you were yelling in your sleep.
Really?
Yes, you were shouting out, "Amber! Amber!
what could that mean?
I'm... I'm doing a painting job.
I'm thinking about, uh...
shades of yellow that go in the kitchen.
Nope. Definitely not a color. Sounded like a name... Amber.
know anyone by that name?
I once had a girlfriend named amber.
did you?
and at this time I'd like to point out, that dreaming of an old girlfriend is not cheating.
well... When was this?
you never told me about her.
I... I don't know. Seven years ago?
seven years?
was it serious?
we lived together...
for, uh, three years.
so you were in love with her.
well... Yeah, until she left me.
so she left you.
you miss her?
I tend to not dwell on people who stomped on my heart.
now if you don't mind, I'm gonna go back to sleep, so I can dream about you.
Oh.
it's so great visiting a retirement village...
2 regular parking spaces, 48 handicapped.
Hey, mom.
Lynette...
this is Frank.
it is so nice to meet you, frank.
call me "Dad."
wouldn't it be awful if I was that guy?
Oh.
Aw.
so... Frank, um, I've just been dying to meet you, and...
just a second. Hey, boy.
we've been waiting ten minutes for our menu.
what do I got to do to get you to hurry it over, build a fence?
Hey, it's a menu, not a high school diploma.
I'm sure you can find one somewhere.
Oh, yeah. You were saying something?
Lynette's been dying to meet you.
she has so many questions.
Oh, go ahead. I got time to kill while I'm waiting for Pancho Villa to get my menu.
okay. Uh... I was just wondering, what made you decide to propose to my mother?
I love her. What do you think?
Aw. What a short... angry story.
Frank... is very to the point.
that's what first attracted me to him.
Oh. What else you need to know?
um, have you ever been married before?
three times... two dead and two left me.
Oh, wait a minute. That's four. Yeah, then make it four.
now... You done grilling me?
Yes. I think I've learned everything I need to know.
Hi, Gaby. - Hey, Karen.
I wanted to get the name of that Chinese place you and Roy are always raving about.
come on in. I'll get you the address.
Carlos is a little grumpy - since the credit card bills came in. - Hmm.
I figured a little m. s.g. should calm him down.
I've got a menu here somewhere.
I never noticed that before.
what?
that doll.
Oh, Adelaide.
heck, I've had her since forever.
she was my best friend growing up.
I couldn't bear to toss her, so there she is.
I didn't know you were into dolls.
I'm not really into them. Oh! Here's the menu.
where did, uh, that come from?
I carry her around with me.
you do?
Mm-hmm. Her name's Princess Valerie.
Oh! Look! They could be sisters.
okay.
Oh, I have an idea.
miss Charlotte's Doll Academy, where I got Valerie, has this tearoom.
it is beautiful. All of us should go sometime.
by all of us, you mean the dolls?
of course. Should I make a reservation?
well... maybe.
I'm kinda curious to see where this all goes.
here. - Thanks.
Oh, no!
what's wrong?
I said "No mayo," like, 15 times.
I'll trade with you. Do you want my salad?
uh, let me check. Nope, still got a penis.
I want my hamburger the way I ordered it.
I'll get you a new one. - I got tee time in ten minutes.
so go!
it'll be waiting for you at the condo, wrapped in foil, with an ice cold beer when you get there.
you're... you're so good to me.
see you at the wedding, Lorraine.
so what do you think?
well, he's quite a...
I wouldn't even know where to... okay, he's gone.
how can you marry that jerk? - Lynette!
I mean it. He's abrasive, obnoxious, borderline racist...
no, he crossed the border of racist.
he lives in racist. You cannot seriously love him.
I don't.
you... you don't?
then why are you marrying him?
because he's loaded, and he hates his kids, and he's got a bad ticker.
and when he kicks the bucket, I get everything.
you're marrying him for his money?
please. I married for love three times and ended up broken hearted and piss-poor.
and by the way, He's getting something out of this, too.
you wanna know how I really broke my foot?
Paul?
what are you doing up? Is everything all right?
couldn't sleep.
I've just been... sitting here, thinking.
about what?
I have so much hatred inside me...
from my neighbors who betrayed me...
for my son who disowned me.
for whoever tried to kill me.
I'm tired of hating people, but I don't know how to stop.
what a thing to say.
stop being so hard on yourself.
you're a decent man.
you just need to focus on what's good in your life.
what is that again?
well, for starters, me.
I do think about you... all the time.
from the first moment I met you, all I wanted was for you to love me.
and... here we are.
here we are.
you're just tired.
come back to bed.
all right.
tomorrow we can talk about our trip.
we need to decide where we're going.
Yes, about that...
I booked us a cabin in the woods.
cabin? Oh, that sounds... rustic.
I need to go somewhere far away where nobody can find us.
okay.
you can be happy, Paul.
you just need to identify what's negative in your life...
and then get rid of it.
that sounds like a plan.
Hey, Karen. Gaby is in the kitchen.
actually, I wanna talk to you about Gaby.
how's she doing lately?
well, you know, we went through kind of a rough patch, but I think she's coming around now.
yeah? Well, think again.
girls, dinner's ready! I made your favorite...
what are you doing here?
Gaby. - Aah!
Jeez! You scared me.
this wasn't a gift for Bob and Lee, was it?
why'd you lie to me?
because I knew you wouldn't understand.
you spent $800 on a doll for yourself.
y... you're right. I... I don't understand.
Oh, please.
like this is any crazier than your collections.
a steroid freak hits a baseball over a fence, and you paid thousands of dollars for it.
Yeah, well, I don't carry it around with me - or take it to tea. - Okay, first of all, Mrs. Mccluskey has a big mouth.
second, the doll makes me happy. What do you care?
Gaby, I want you to be happy, but this is not about a doll.
you know what? I don't want to talk about this anymore.
this is clearly about Grace.
No! No! No!
we're not supposed to talk about her!
that was your rule!
I'm going to get ready for dinner.
Hey, Susan.
sit here, the seat is still hot.
Thanks, Ethan. Hey, how was your history final?
aced it. Thank you for studying with me.
no problem. I'll see you Thursday. - Yeah.
Scrabble.
look, I know you don't wanna talk, but I thought it would be more fun to play with me than with your phone.
Thanks, but I'll take the phone.
you know, this whole experience is miserable and isolating enough.
I don't understand why you wanna make it worse by ignoring someone who's going through the same ordeal.
Susan, did you ever see the old war movie where the fresh young kid comes in all bright-eyed, and the old vet won't give him the time of day?
I hate war movies.
okay.
what about the one where the girl moves to a different town, and the mean cheerleader at her new school doesn't wanna hang out with her?
go on.
I'm the mean cheerleader. Okay?
and I'm letting you know we're not going to be friends.
you know, I can see why you're frustrated.
waiting for a transplant is brutal.
I... I get that.
but that doesn't mean that you can't try to stay positive while you wait for the good news.
the good news?
when this beeper goes off, that means someone died.
that's what we're waiting for... for some poor son of a bitch who didn't use a helmet or a seat belt to die.
we're waiting for a doctor to ask a family who, moments earlier, lost someone they loved to let them harvest their organs.
and then we're waiting to see who gets them.
that's what we do. We wait for tragedy.
and then cross our fingers that it's us they wake up at 2: 00 in the morning with the good news.
Susan...
I know your intentions are good, but you don't have to distract me or entertain me or comfort me.
I wasn't trying to comfort... you.
Hi, Amber. What are you doing here?
well, you seemed so upset when you came over, and obviously it involves Keith, or you wouldn't have come looking for him, and so naturally I'm concerned.
everything's fine. It's not a big deal.
anyway, I'm sort of in the middle of packing, so...
mommy, I can't find my ball.
Charlie, I'll be with you in a second, okay?
how old is Charlie?
6.0
Keith and I would be great for a while and then not so great.
I had actually moved out before I realized I was pregnant.
so why didn't you tell Keith?
I had actually decided to give up the baby, and I knew he would try and talk me out of it.
then I changed my mind the moment I saw Charlie.
after that, it just never felt right to come back and ambush him with a kid.
and yet... here you are, ambushing.
it's just... Charlie is at that age where he's starting to ask a lot of questions, and I'm running out of ways to be vague.
so Charlie is the only reason you came?
okay.
maybe I... was kind of wondering if Keith would still be...
but I'm glad he's happy.
you seem really great.
I know I owe it to Charlie to tell Keith.
it's just... I don't think I can do it.
would you like me to?
you would do that?
I think I have to.
now, it's not exactly finished yet.
I'm still waiting on a few pieces, and the curtains are on back order.
don't worry. I'm sure it's amazing.
but you did keep the receipts, right?
Oh, my god.
it's exactly the room I wanted when I was growing up.
I mean, the only thing that's missing is...
baby unicorns!
so... you like it?
Oh, we love it. Thank you, Renee.
it's everything we'd hoped for. How did you put this together so quickly?
Oh, it was easy.
I've been thinking about this room for 20 years.
Really?
there was a time when I thought I might have kids.
I used to imagine the kind of room I'd like to give my daughter.
right down to the last detail.
I never knew you thought about kids.
well, that was a long time ago.
it's never too late. Heck, if we can adopt...
excuse me. I've gotta find that painter.
this is not the color we agreed on for the trim.
I can't do it. I can't be a party to this.
I can't wheel her down the aisle to marry some jack ass
she doesn't even love.
Lynette, you have to do this.
besides, you know, think of what's at stake now.
what are you talking about?
well, you know, how can I put this delicately?
I mean, today your mother has money.
someday soon she will die.
the day after that, Tom and Lynette have money.
that's a horrible thing to say.
well, just saying, you've always wanted to put Paige in private school, and I've always wanted to know what it's like to sleep on a yacht.
you're lucky you're holding the baby.
Lynette, in all seriousness, it's your mother's wedding day.
if you don't support her, you're gonna ruin your relationship.
Lynette!
yeah?
they're playing my song.
are you ready to wheel me down?
Lynette! Lynette!
Lynette!
what are you doing?
okay, here's the thing. I can't let you do this.
who asked you?
you can't marry an obnoxious jerk like that.
mom, you want me to visit more often?
that is never gonna happen if you're with him.
and think about the example you are setting your grandchildren...
marrying a guy for his money.
now, look, Tom and I have a little savings...
Lynette, I know Frank's a bit of an acquired taste.
but...
he needs me.
nobody needs me anymore.
your sisters are always busy.
I never see you.
I try to see you as much as I can, but...
I know.
your family needs you.
and Frank... needs me.
why didn't you tell me this?
why did you let me think it was all about the money?
I guess it was easier to say that than to admit how... useless and lonely I feel.
okay.
Hello? We're trying to have a wedding out here.
Oh, sorry! My daughter doesn't think you're good enough for me.
she's right. Now hurry it up.
this church is in one of those ethnic neighborhoods, and I'm worried about the car.
Renee, there is someone we'd like you to meet.
this is our daughter.
hello. - We just picked her up from the airport, and we wanted you to be - the first person on the lane to meet her. - Oh, you didn't have to do that.
we know.
I think I'm gonna start getting her settled in.
say good-bye to Mrs. Perry. - Bye.
come on.
she's absolutely precious.
Yeah. We're very lucky.
listen, can I ask you for a favor?
Lee, you know I don't like sentences that start that way.
Bob and I have been thinking, and even though I know we are gonna be great fathers, there may be times that Jenny needs to talk to a woman about... stuff.
and on those rare occasions, I was wondering if we could bring her over here.
well...
sure.
great. I will go tell our daughter that if she needs anything, she can count on her old Auntie Renee.
and if she ever calls me "Old auntie," I will kick her.
got it. Sorry.
those are beautiful, Susan.
thank you, Ethan.
don't worry. They're not for you.
they're for people who still possess an ounce of humanity.
whatever you say, Pollyanna. But if I see any mylar balloons with...with dogs wearing stethoscopes,
I'm filing a complaint.
why are you always so miserable?
it's called anger, Susan.
I'm sure you have it, too,
right underneath that "Hang in there, kitty" Smile.
Hey, Dick, take it easy. - It's okay, Ethan.
fine. You're angry. The rest of us aren't.
so stop dragging us into your circle of self-pity.
Ugh. Come on.
it's me.
I'm so happy for you.
thank you.
I gotta go call my mom.
Yeah.
ready, Susan?
Yes.
actually, um, if it's okay, I'm gonna sit over here today.
sure.
what are you doing?
leaving a note for the gardener.
if he has any more problems with those sprinklers,
I want him to know that we'll be at the cabin.
Oh. Good idea.
Beth, I think we should bring some extra blankets.
it might get cold. Would you mind grabbing a couple?
not at all.
detectives. Everything okay?
I'm sure your wife told you a gun was recently discovered at Bree Van De Kamp's house.
Yes, apparently it was the same caliber that I was shot with.
Bree seems to think your wife planted it there, hoping to implicate some of her friends in your shooting.
what an imagination she has.
so you've never seen this before?
Mr. Young?
Yes.
you seemed to have quite a reaction there.
I'm not comfortable around firearms, that's all.
well, just to be clear, you do not believe this belongs to your wife?
detectives, I know for a fact this is not Beth's gun.
good day.
should we take two blankets or three?
forget the blankets. The trip's off.
what? Why?
I got a call. There's a problem with the cabin.
Oh, shoot.
and I was so looking forward to it.
trust me, Beth.
I think you dodged a bullet here.
Mmm. I don't know what you do to this chicken, but it's the best thing that I've ever had. Mmm.
so I, um, stopped by Bob and Lee's house.
they're so excited about finally becoming fathers.
it got me to thinking, I know you had said that you were okay with not being able to have a child.
is that... still the case?
uh, yeah.
that didn't sound very convincing.
it's kind of a weird question.
okay, well, let me rephrase it.
if you had the chance to be a father, would you take it?
Bree, where is this coming from? I thought we dealt with this.
well, I just wanna make sure. I don't want you to see Bob and Lee with their child and start to have regrets.
what do you want me to say?
all right, there was a time in my life when I thought,
Yeah. Yeah. I'd love to be a dad, but then I met you.
I'm just saying... if you had the choice...
I don't.
this is really good chicken.
so?
I'm sorry.
he doesn't even wanna meet Charlie?
well, you have to understand that after six years,
Keith feels that it would be too difficult for everyone.
why did I wait so long?
again, I am so sorry.
Oh, no. You don't have to do that.
please. Keith and I feel that we really need to do something.
so please... take it.
sorry. I had to show the sitter how to work the TV.
now where is the Chinese place!
you put her in a car seat?
Oh. Well, she's expensive, and the way you drive...
honey, I've been thinking.
maybe we should go see a therapist together.
I don't need a therapist.
I think you do. Maybe I haven't been fair to you.
but you do really need to talk to someone about this.
Carlos, I'm not crazy.
well, then should I change the reservation to three?
don't be ridiculous. She's not gonna sit with us.
she fits right in my bag.
this doesn't look like a place you'd put a restaurant.
no, it looks like a place you'd bury a body.
will you please just put the address - into the navigation system? - For the tenth time, I don't need it.
I know where Oak Park is. - Carlos, I'm starving!
I will not think you're weak if you use a navigation system!
fine. I'll use it.
I'd much rather listen to that annoying voice than that one.
what's the address?
okay. It's 119... - Get out of the car!
Oh, god! - Okay, okay, take it easy, man.
now! - Get out. We're doing it. Be cool.
uh, can you hold on?
what do you mean, hold on? Get the hell out of the car! - Gaby!
I gotta get my baby!
Oh, crap. Just...
it's a doll! What are you trying to pull, bitch? - Oh, god.
get out before I put a bullet in you! - No!
Gaby! Get out!
I can't get the buckle! - Gaby, come on!
I can't get the buckle! I can't get the buckle! - Get... uhh!
No! Ohh! My baby! My baby! My baby!
my baby! -Gaby!
it's not Grace!
whoa. What are you doing to your roses?
pruning them.
looks like you're killing them.
I know it looks bad, but sometimes you have to be ruthless if you want something beautiful to keep growing.
the world is filled with people who do ugly things.
why do they act this way?
some lie to keep from losing what they love.
some lash out because they fear the future.
some put up walls because they have regrets.
Yes, everyone has a reason for the ugly things they do...
once we find out why, then we can try to stop them.
you're marrying him for his money?
Lynette had reservations about her mother's marriage.
you can't marry an obnoxious jerk like that.
Susan began her wait for a kidney donor.
I'm going on the wait list. - That could take years.
Bree found out that Keith had a son but decided not to tell him...
Keith feels that it would be too difficult for everyone.
easing her guilt with a check.
get out of the car! - Oh, god!
Gaby's obsession with her doll...
I gonna get my baby! - Get out!
nearly cost her life. - My baby!
Gaby! It's not Grace!
and paul recognized the gun that was used to shoot him.
paul Young had a son.
but he had not seen Zach in years.
he had lost him to a world of fast women...
easy money...
and hard drugs.
Yes, paul had lost his son...
but he was determined to find him.
and he would do anything...
even if that meant asking for help...
from a man who despised him.
what the hell are you doing here?
I need a favor.
from me? - I know. You hate me, and I hate you.
now that we're done with our traditional greeting, can I tell you what I want?
Yeah, go ahead.
I need to find Zach.
I went to that mansion his grandfather left him.
it's in foreclosure. - Yeah, I heard about that.
do you know where he went?
Yeah, I don't know where he is.
and even if I did, why would I do you any favors?
Zach's the one who shot me.
what?
the police showed me the gun.
it was the same one mary alice used to kill herself.
and Zach kept it?
he's always been a strange boy.
if you really think he tried to kill you, why didn't you tell the police?
I'd like to keep this in the family.
so again, where is he?
last I heard, Idaho.
Well...If you hear from him, tell him I know what he did...
and I'm very disappointed.
though he didn't admit it, Mike knew exactly where Zach was.
but Paul Young had lost his son...
he did not want to be found.
it doesn't matter where we're going.
it doesn't matter how quickly we try to get there.
it doesn't matter that we never look back.
the past we left behind will still find a way to catch up to us.
I'm making grilled salmon. Why did you get a pizza?
because you're making grilled salmon.
I wish you wouldn't put that terrible food in your body.
it's not good for you. - Come on.
I know you want a bite.
Ah. Eat it. Eat it.
seriously, I have better-tasting food under my refrigerator.
Hello?
Hi, Bree. It's Amber.
I'm sorry to bother you. - Uh, no bother.
look, I'm outside. I need to talk to you.
no, uh, don't come over. I'll, um, come to you.
see you soon.
I need to run to Lynette's for a minute.
do you mind waiting for dinner?
hurry up. I'm starved.
Hi.
so the bank says your check is gonna take five days to clear.
is there any way you can get me a cashier's check?
I really need to pay some bills. - Absolutely.
um, there's a restaurant across from the bank.
I can meet you there tomorrow at 2: 00.
that'll be great. Thank you again, bree.
Bree, wait.
I know Keith doesn't wanna meet Charlie.
but he should at least know what his son looks like.
I'm sure he'll appreciate that.
so according to the donor database,
I will be waiting three to four years.
where does that put me on the list?
I- I mean,is there a number? - There is no number.
it all boils down to your DNA.
and how long you've been waiting.
so, you have your beeper.
Yep.
four years is a long time.
Susan Bremer?
yeah?
I am Monroe Carter, from Fairview high school.
I sat behind you in chem lab.
I was yearbook photographer?
now I sell pharmaceutical supplies.
you know,I friended you on facebook,like,12 times.
I guess I didn't get them.
no worries. Tell me, what's new? How are you?
I'm gonna be spending the next three to four years on dialysis three times a week, five hours a day.
Wow. I-I didn't know.
then again,if you'd friended me...
I'll see you at the reunion...
if I'm still alive.
you like? Frank gave them to me.
they belonged to my first wife. - She's dead.
isn't that a little... weird?
hell, no. This necklace belonged to his second wife, and she's sitting right over there.
that's weird.
well, I have to admit, you two seem very happy together.
tell her about Saturday. - What about Saturday?
Frank wants you to bring Tom and the kids back up here.
I wanna take a family portrait.
family is very important to Frank.
and since my first three families aren't speaking to me,
I wanna get this one right, so I can rub it in their miserable faces.
Oh,that's a sweet thought, but Saturdays are kind of crazy for us.
penny's got ballet, parker's studying for the s.a.t.s.
Well,how about I make it worth your while?
you're bribing me?
call it gas money if it'll make you feel any better.
will $500 do it? - I'm not taking his money.
Frank, isn't time for your heart medicine?
look how she takes care of me.
do what you have to do to make this work.
but I'm not going over a grand.
what are you doing?
I just married the man. He's in the process of redoing his will, so we've gotta play ball.
no. I am not gonna bend over backwards just to please that jerk.
you're the one who married him, not me.
I can't tell Frank no.
but I can tell you no.
so if you want the picture, you can come to our house.
fine. I'll talk to him.
and will you stop staring at this necklace, Phyllis?
you are not getting it back!
yf Saint Laurent ended the fashion show.
by the way, he can't swim.
but he rents a yacht for the after-party.
and that's where I met Mick Jagger.
do you have any wine?
we don't really do wine in therapy.
Ah. Well,you should.
a few glasses, and you'd have your patients whining about how daddy didn't love them in half the time.
did your father not love you?
I was joking.
my dad was great.
he died when I was a kid.
Well,that must have been hard...
growing up without a male presence?
no. She remarried.
Oh, my god.
I forgot to tell you the best part of the Jagger story.
he read my palm.
and he told me I would be going below deck to have sex with him.
he is not only a great singer, but also an amazing psychic.
Gaby, why don't you like talking about your childhood?
what's the point? The past is the past.
well, sometimes what happens to us in the past affects who we are today.
Oh, by the way, Jagger - Big cuddler.
Gaby, come on. We're gonna have to go deeper here.
well, that's the thing about me-There is no deeper.
ask any of my friends.
I'm the shallowest person they know.
I'm just skin,a little blood, and stories about Keith Richards drinking out of my shoes.
you don't have to be afraid.
let's talk about your childhood.
I love therapy.
Really? - Yeah. It's like a talk show, where I'm the guest and the only topic is me.
so it's helping? You talked to her about the doll? Ya-bup-bup-bup-bup!
that is confidential. First rule of therapy.
actually, first rule of therapy is no wine, but I'm gonna change that.
I'm so glad this is working. I've been worried about you.
it's exactly what I needed.
in fact, I'm gonna be going three times a week.
Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays.
wow, that's a lot. Well, it was your idea.
Oh, by the way, uh, you're gonna have to take over my carpools on mondays.
that's okay, right?
sure. I guess I could move some things around.
and no golf on Thursdays, because you'll have to take Juanita to ballet.
Gaby, I do business on the links.
do you want me to get better or not?
okay.
okay. I will cancel golf.
Oh, and on Friday, I have a gynecologist appointment. - Gaby!
that I need you to cancel.
wouldn't that be great,though?
Hi. - Hi.
I see you brought charlie.
well,you know,I don't have anyone to watch him.
uh, I have your cashier's check. - Thank you again, Bree.
honey, let's go. - No. I haven't finished my pizza.
let's go. - no!
listen, Bree, do you mind keeping an eye on him?
the bank is right across the way.
I'll only be ten minutes. - I don't know.
just order some pizza. - It'll be on me.
so, Charlie...
I'm gonna play games.
right. Much better than conversation.
Oh. Mr. Lynwood. - Susan.
my beeper went off. Does that mean - Yes, we found you a donor.
Oh, but how? I mean, you said it would probably take years.
well, the rules change if someone wants to donate a kidney to a specific individual.
wait. Uh... This is someone I know?
apparently.
he's in my office right now signing the paperwork.
is it a man？
I'm getting a man kidney?
not that I'm complaining.
Oh, my god.
Hey, Susan.
Monroe. You're my donor?onor?
Yeah. Turns out I'm a match. I mean,what are the odds,huh?
I don't know what to say.
well, I'm giving you a vital organ.
how about "thank you"?
why would you do this?
we haven't seen each other for years, and...
I barely remembered you.
I remembered you.
you were really wonderful to me in high school.
and you're in trouble, and I wanna help.
well... Thank you.
so what's a guy gotta do to get a hug?
give you a lung?
Oh, come here,you!
Oh, please know you've made me very happy.
I'm so glad.
busted.
I'm on my way to Mrs. Goodman's place to finish that job, and what do I see?
your car is parked in front of a pizza joint.
Yeah, about that- - Admit it. You're hooked.
what are you, a deep-dish girl? Thin crust?
Yep. You got me. I am a closet pizza lover.
mystery solved. You can go to your job now.
I need more quarters.
who's this? What do you got,some secret boyfriend?
this is, um, Charlie.
I'm, uh, watching, uh, him for a friend of mine.
I'm sorry, Charlie. I don't have any more change.
now, could you excuse us?- You got quarters?
I got some.
come on.
what about Mrs. Goodman?
she's lived without a screen door for 30 years.
she can wait another half hour.
all right. Let's see what you got.
I'm gonna show you something. This is a secret, all right?
this is just between you and me.
in the cookie jar. Bang. Let's see it.
Hey! High five.
that was a good one. Let's see it again. One more.
Uh-huh. Step-back jumper fadeaway.
nice one.
are you kidding me? One more, I'm calling the NBA.
that was awesome.
did you see that? Three in a row.
I certainly did. It was wonderful.
Charlie, I gotta take off. Nice meeting you.
see you later.
Bye!
Bye. Remember me when you're on the lakers.
they're here!
Frank drives a bentley.
of course he does.
why are we taking this stupid picture?
I mean, we barely even know the guy.
we're doing it for your grandma.
and the lovely man she just married.
Hello! Welcome!
Hello, everybody! - Hey, grandma.
so, this really is where they live.
I thought you were kidding.
how was the drive over, Frank?
it took slowly.
we got behind this Asian woman driver.
slow as soy sauce going uphill in winter.
okay. Small talk's over. Let's take the picture.
we were all thinking we'd sit over here.
no, I don't wanna see your crappy kitchen in the background there.
let's move this sofa over there. I want it to be real homey.
Cagney and lacey, grab this end of the couch.
what are you doing?
you can't just walk into people's houses and move furniture around.
when it looks like this, you can.
Uh-no, no, no. Put it back.
it's bad enough you make me drive all the way out here to east podunk. Well, bull!
I want my picture, my way!
whatever you say.
Frank, that's too heavy. You're all red.
well, that's because the girls here were not much help.
okay.
here we go.
everybody smile and say "bentley."
Bentley.
okay. Nobody move. I wanna check that it's good.
Oh. Hang on.
we have to do it again. Frank, your eyes are closed.
Oh, no.
what's wrong?
he's dead.
of course he is.
there's no pulse.
no pulse. He's definitely dead.
is his ghost gonna be trapped in our house?
is he gonna haunt us?
no, honey. Of course not.
right?
gross. A dead guy's on our couch. And I'm having friends over.
how long till he starts to smell?
kids, go upstairs. There's nothing to see here.
what are you talking about? There's a dead body.
that's totally something to see.
okay, kids. Come on. Let's go upstairs.
come on.
mom, I'm so sorry.
I can't believe he's gone. Just like that.
I know. I know.
what are you doing?
uh, I'm calling the police so they can get a coroner over here.
uh, hang on. Y - you can't call them yet.
why not?
I told you before.
the one leaving everything to me?
it doesn't go into effect until tomorrow.
Oh, no.
no, no.
you want me to keep him here?
like that? All night?
if we call the coroner now, I get nothing.
if we call in the morning... Millions.
I didn't want Frank in my house when he was alive.
now you want me to hang out with his corpse?
well, then throw a sheet over him and spray a little air freshener.
you won't even notice. Frank wanted me to have that money.
No! I-it's too weird!
y - you wouldn't have to take care of me anymore.
in fact, I could even take care of you.
college tuition? Braces?
it would make me feel so good to be able to help you for a change.
it's been a long time, son.
Yeah, I guess.
how's it going?
I couldn't be better.
what can I do for you? Wait, wait,wait.
let me guess. You want money.
I nailed it, didn't I? Uh, but you can see, a lot of other people -They...They got here first.
well, sorry to hear that.
who cares? Was time to downsize, minimize my carbon footprint.
you feeling okay, Buddy?
I feel great.
sounds like you're the one having problems.
well, Susan and I are going through a rough time, like a lot of people.
so how screwed are you?
we had to rent out our house...
to your father, in fact.
my father's in prison.
he's out. You didn't know?
no.
you sure you're okay? - I just can't believe that bastard gets to walk free after everything that he did!
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. - It's-it's okay. Just...
could you leave? I need to be alone.
you never sneak up behind someone when they're staring at a dead person!
jeez.
I'm sorry. It's just... Your scream...
it was like all the testosterone left your body at once.
this whole thing creeps me out.
Mm. It's just...A body.
how do you become this guy?
9 kids, 14 grandchildren, and you never talk to any of them.
that's the tricky thing about money.
changes people.
changes relationships.
it sure does.
and after you're dead, what's it all mean?
not funny.
hello.
Hi. This is Maria. I'm just calling to confirm Gabrielle Solis for her 1: 00 appointment.
Yep. She's on her way.
terrific. You wouldn't happen to know what kind of treatment she wants today, do you?
uh, I don't know.
whatever you've been doing seems to be working.
well, on Monday she got the seaweed wrap, Wednesday the hot stone massage. We just want to make sure she takes full advantage of our entire spa menu.
Oh, she is taking full advantage, all right.
Oh, good, Sandro. There you are.
I think we should start on my shoulders today.
Mm. That's good.
maybe a little lighter on the pressure.
no, no. Lighter.
okay, maybe let's not do the shoulders.
okay. How about the glutes?
Carlos? What are you doing here?
what are you doing here? You're supposed to be in therapy.
this is therapy! Didn't you see the sign?
"massage therapy," "aromatherapy."
I talked to Dr. Wyner. She said that you haven't been back since the first session. Why not?
I just don't think I really need it.
I mean this is really helping.
no. This is ignoring the problem.
you know, the way you say "problem,"
you make it seem a whole lot worse than it actually is.
Gaby, you almost got us killed pulling a doll out of the car.
fine. If it'll get you off my ass, I'll make an appointment for next week.
now get your clothes on. We're leaving.
God, now I'm so tense.
I'll give you 100 bucks if you work on my shoulders for ten minutes.
that's for free. Let's go.
he came downstairs just after midnight to watch TV, and we didn't find him until this morning.
well, in that case, I'll just put down time of death around 3: 00 a. m.
would you like us to bring the body directly to the funeral home?
Yes, thank you.
again, ma'am, I'm sorry for your loss.
Oh, my god. I'm rich!
again, ma'am, I'm sorry for your loss.
Oh, I know.
I spent some of the best weeks of my life with Frank.
but he's gone,there's nothing we can do about it, and I am a millionaire.
good. You can buy me a new couch.
I'll buy you whatever you want. - Oh, I was kidding.
well, I wasn't. What do you need? Anyone.
I need a laptop for school.
done. - Can I have a motorcycle?
for school? - Kids, knock it off.
Frank's body's not even in the van yet.
actually, it is.
I don't care. We're not talking about money right now.
a man died- Not a bank account-a man.
let's show a little respect.
we should probably figure out what to do about that bentley.
anybody here?
Zach, it's me!
sorry. It's, uh...
it's a rough neighborhood.
you know how it is.
so... Two visits in one year.
what's up?
Hey, would you mind, uh, sitting down? We need to talk.
do we?
sure... Just... A minute.
who you looking for, Zach? Your father?
paul came to see me.
he thinks you shot him. That true?
okay, I shot him.
he ruined my life, but he gets to start his over.
it didn't seem fair.
Oh, god.
it was easy. I practiced it in my head over and over again, and then... Bam! Showtime.
but then I got all paranoid and I dumped the stupid gun at bree's. I mean, I don't-I don't know what I was thinking with that one. I wasn't thinking.
Yeah. That's the problem with being high.
you do things without thinking.
what? I'm not using drugs.
Zach. I've been there.
you need help. Now we got to get you into rehab.
you want to send me to rehab? So what, so my father can come and find me and take me to prison? No way.
I just want to get you some help.
it's too late for you to pretend to be my father.
you're right. But I still care.
then why did you let me go in the first place?
you're the one who let me get raised by that monster. .
no, that's not how things happened - I don't care. I don't care. - Let me help you.
just get out my house, all right? Just get out of my house!
it's really nice of you to have me over.
are you kidding? I am gonna be spending the rest of my life thinking of ways to thank you. But as a start...
Oh. Really?
Oh, come on. All right, let's...
that is so sweet.
a crystal heart.
I looked for a crystal kidney - Surprisingly hard to find.
you know, in high school.
I always dreamt you'd give me your heart.
you know, speaking of high school, I, uh, have a present for you, too.
in addition to the one that's being ripped out of your body?
I'm sorry. That - That was a little too vivid.
no, that's all right.
here, uh... Here you go.
Oh... What is this?
it's just some memorabilia that i'd thought you'd enjoy. Oh.
some photos I took that didn't make the cut for the yearbook.
Oh, my god.
there I am on the field hockey team...
and in "pippin."
these are great. Who else do you have in here?
Oh, there's me on the debate club...
and me at the spring formal...
and me in a bathing suit...
taken through a fence.
not easy to get.
those bushes around your yard were really thick.
is this one of my old English papers?
Yeah. You threw it away, and I fished it out of the garbage.
that's also where I found this. Uh...
here.
my retainer?
I would have returned it, but I was too scared to talk to you.
isn't it funny how we're talking now?
Yeah, really funny.
and now...
we're gonna be bonded...
you know... Forever.
you know, if you told me back in high school that one day my kidney would be cleansing susan bremer's blood,
I would have been the happiest guy on the earth.
well, I'm glad I could make that happen for you.
here. Why don't you go see what's shaking at the malt shop?
Thanks, grandma.
Hey. What's all this?
a little thank you for all the help you've been the last few days. Open it,open it.
wow, it's beautiful.
Mm-hmm. 2,200 bucks. Didn't bat an eye.
that's a lot of money.
Oh, there's more where that came from.
Hey, why don't you and the whole fam-damily come to my house for dinner sunday night?
I thought you were coming here Sunday night.
I was gonna send one of the kids to pick you up.
Nah. I think it's better you come to me.
Oh, but Sunday's a school night, and Tom's got an early meeting Monday morning. How about Saturday?
no, Sunday.
Oh, heads up. And dinners at the center are fancy. You'll have to squeeze those boys of yours into some jackets and ties.
but, mom... Mom... Mom!
are you not listening? It's not gonna work for us.
I would think you would want to make it work, Lynette...
given everything I'm gonna be doing for the family.
are you blackmailing me?
No! I'm inviting you to dinner.
if you can't make it, I can ask one of your sisters.
no, no, no, no, no. No, cover your man. Come on.
Hey, babe. Game's almost over.
are you kidding me?
you okay?
I'm sorry. I should have given this to you before.
why are you giving me a picture of the kid from the pizza place?
he is your son.
I still can't get over this.
you run into some random classmate from high school, and he's gonna end up saving your life?
here's the part I can't get over.
you never put out for this guy?
no. No, I barely remember him. Monroe is just doing this incredibly selfless act of charity. It's inspiring.
what's this?
uh... Nothing. Just put that away.
it's got your name on the cover in glitter.
no, it's just a gift from monroe. Can I please have that?
Oh, my god.
Yeah. You used to be cute. What happened?
no, there are million pictures of you here.
I guess he had a little crush on me.
crush? No, Susan. This Monroe guy is obsessed with you.
this is a shrine. - It is not.
it is. I know. I've made them. That's why I'm not allowed to mail things to ryan seacrest anymore.
it's creepy. It's like part of movie when they go into the guy's basement and find the candles in front of the picture of the woman he's gonna kill.
you know... Those guys are often misunderstood.
and you're gonna take a kidney from this man?
okay, I admit, I - I'm a little concerned, and, yes, he may be 5% stalker.
is this a lock of your hair?
10% stalker.
but if I don't take his kidney, I could wait another six years.
why shouldn't I do it?
because you'll be forever connected to him.
you'll never get rid of him.
and I have a feeling that's not the only organ he wants to...
share with you.
Carlos, can you feel my forehead? - No.
I think I have a fever. You're fine.
you didn't even feel! - 'cause I don't need to. Liar.
no, I'm really sick. Let's reschedule.
I shouldn't see the therapist today.
we're going in.
what if I need to throw up? - It's a therapist's office.
you're supposed to get it all out. - Carlos.
you are going to therapy, and that's all there is to it.
fine. Can I at least go to the bathroom first?
you know I have a bladder the size of a dime.
how many years have we been married? - Too many, if you ask me!
where do you think you're going? - I'm going home.
no. Gaby, you are sick. You need help.
look, you want me take pills, I will take them.
you want me to see a hypnotist? - Bring him to the house.
hell, I'll even let you hire a priest to do an exorcism.
but what I am not going to do is talk to that woman in there.
why not?
because she wants to talk about my childhood!
can I say one thing?
you did find a way to talk about it before... With me.
just that once. We had gotten married.
I thought you had a right to know.
and you said that you never wanted to talk about it again, and I have respected that.
but over the years, I have seen what it costs you.
the nights I hear you crying in the bathroom...
sad look on your face when people ask about your past...
you think that you've left it behind, but you haven't, Gaby.
you carry that burden around with you.
I just want you to consider the idea that this therapist might be able to help you let all that go.
can you come with me?
so when I lost Grace, it tapped into this need I have to protect children.
where do you think this need came from?
because no one protected me.
when I was a child, my stepfather molested me.
get in.
why would I do that?
I know where Zach is.
are we driving to Idaho?
look, the reason I didn't tell you where he was before is I didn't know what you wanted to do to him.
but whatever it is, it can't be worse than what he's doing to himself.
and why should I care about that after he tried to kill me?
he's your son.
he's my son.
he needs our help.
Hey, neighbor.
Monroe. Uh...
what do you mean,"neighbor"?
well, uh, your landlady is showing me an apartment.
I figured now that we're back in each other's lives, it would be better if I lived close.
Yeah, uh...Here's the thing about that.
there's close...
and then there's glenn close.
this feels a little...
stalky.
Stalky?
I'm giving you a kidney.
Monroe, come with me.
the other day, when you were over here,
I did not give you the full story.
this is Mike. He is my husband.
and this is our son MJ.
okay. Why are you showing me this?
because I want you to see that there isn't room for anyone else in that picture.
don't get me wrong.
I am so grateful that you want to give me a kidney.
but once the operation is over, that has to be it.
Why?
Because...You want to be more than friends, and I'm married.
the tricky part is that...
I still need a kidney...
because I want to stay healthy for...
the two special guys in that picture.
so if you...Still want to give me one...
no strings attached,
I will be honored to take it...
and you will have my eternal gratitude.
Yeah, but that's all I'll have.
what do you say?
I can't.
I, uh...
I thought if I did this, then...You would finally...
I - I know.
I know.
I - I'm so sorry.
don't be. I'll be fine.
all right. I'll see you around.
actually, I guess I won't.
we may think we've left the past behind, but it has a way...Of catching up to us.
though we want to run away, we are forced to confront our past...
and the secrets that it buried...
must come into the light.
and then, if we are strong, we are able to move on.
Yes, we all need to leave the past behind and move on toward the future.
and if we're lucky, we will have help getting there.
I love this job.
Tom's career took off.
and you gave me the confidence to jump at it.
I could kill you right now, or I could do this.
Felicia made peace with Paul...
and don't you worry about Paul.
or so he thought.
I'll make him pay for what he did to you.
look, I'm your landlord. I have a right to come in.
but it was Susan who gave him hope.
I remember a guy that used to live on this street.
he had a laugh you could hear three houses away.
I'm not that man anymore. - I think you can be.
who do you want in your life - Me or Bree? Choose.
and Gaby made a decision.
can I stay with you for a while? - Of course.
girls, come on. Go on in.
Bree Van de Kamp had occasionally found her home invaded by household pests.
and her manner of dealing with them was ruthless.
she smashed them.
she poisoned them.
she executed them.
but when it came to the latest pests who had invaded Bree's home...
extermination was not an option.
girls! There's mud on your shoes! Mud on your shoes!
girls! We are guests here! What have I said about wiping your feet?
sorry.
no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no! Just-uh, uh, never mind.
it hasn't rained in three weeks. Where did they find mud?
honey, they don't find mud. Mud finds them.
so, um, speaking of the fun we've been having, how long do you think it'll be before you and Carlos make up and you can all... Go back home?
eh, a few days.
he'll be sitting alone in that house, realizing how big it is, how quiet it is...
how clean it is.
then he'll show up here with that hangdog look on his face, begging us to come back.
Ow! Mom! Celia hit me! - Then hit her back!
Gaby, don't tell her to do that.
I'd rather they settle it. Otherwise, I have to go in there.
that's what a mother does. Come on.
girls, if you stop fighting, then I'll let you have some fresh baked... Cookies?!
there were two dozen cookies on that plate.
Yeah, you can't leave food out.
they're like bears. You gotta tie it up in a tree.
uh, Gaby, while you're here, this might be a good time to teach them a little... Discipline.
discipline? What are you talking about? It's not like the plate's broken.
Oh, boy.
Yes, Bree Van de Kamp had finally met two pests she couldn't smash, poison, or shoot.
okay, I'm gonna need a garbage bag.
unless it was an antique. Then I need glue.
that's not to say she wasn't sorely tempted.
good deeds aren't always done for the purest of reasons.
we may be trying to impress.
we may be acting out of guilt.
we may be expecting something in return.
but occasionally, a good deed comes straight from the heart.
Wow. What's this?
your lunch. I got ham, ham and cheese, and that one's ham and gravel. I dropped it.
Susan, you don't have to keep doing this.
I want to. You're my new project, mister.
your project?
Yes. Paul Young, phase two
where we figure out what you are doing with your life, set some new goals.
now...
you tried destroying the neighborhood.
that didn't work out. What's next?
I don't know what I wanna do.
I've made such a mess of everything so far.
no, no. Phase two is about the future, not the past.
so from now on, we are only looking forward.
Oh, my god! Look behind you!
Hello, Susan. - Oh. Hey, Felicia.
Hey, Felicia"? !
you knew she was in your house? I - I thought you were in prison.
Oh, I've been out for weeks.
what nice sandwiches. Are you cooking for Paul now?
Yeah, for Paul...
the guy that you cut off your fingers to frame.
it's all right, Susan.
Felicia and I have reached an understanding.
we can hardly keep squabbling, now that we're going to be neighbors again.
wait. You're living here?
right across the street.
I just came by to pick up some of Beth's things.
although I think you should keep that pretty oil painting she made for you.
hang on. You-you knew Beth?
you didn't tell her.
the topic doesn't exactly introduce itself.
Beth was Felicia's daughter.
what?
so you're Beth's...
and you knew...
and you're living...
I need to sit down.
we're gonna get a lot of this.
so Felicia Tillman was Beth's mother?
Snip-Snip Tillman? You sure? - Yep.
and people say the suburbs are boring?
great. Now we've got another nut job living on the street.
actually... Paul is not so bad.
Yeah, what were you doing over there?
bringing him food. Uh, checking up on him. Making sure he's okay.
Why?
cause I feel bad for him.
the poor guy has had two wives kill themselves.
and here I was concentrating all my pity on the dead people.
Susan, be careful.
Yeah, we understand Beth gave you a kidney, but you don't owe Paul anything.
I know I don't.
but that kidney gave me a second chance in life, and I'm sorry.
I feel that Paul deserves the same thing.
to us, our decorating firm, and our latest triumph, the Delaney bathroom.
today, subway tile and a low-flow toilet.
tomorrow, not walking in on Mr. Delaney on the low-flow toilet.
you bought this at a drugstore, didn't you?
come on. "Dan Perrignon. " It's cute.
a little tip - When picking champagne, wordplay usually isn't a selling point.
Hey. You're home early.
no, just forgot some files. Headed straight back to the office.
Ooh! Dan Perrignon! What are you guys celebrating?
Renee and I finished a design job today.
Yeah. We actually cleared $293.
Well,$290 after this champagne.
Hey, we're a small company. Why is the glass always half empty with you?
Hey, I don't know why I didn't think of this sooner.
I just got my budget.
there's some money in there to redecorate my office.
how about you guys do it?
uh, well, we're a little busy.
it's 20 grand. - Busy thanking you.
you'd let us do that? You're amazing!
that would be huge for our company.
look, I know this new job's put a bit of a strain on us.
this might be a good way to sneak in a little extra time together.
so you think you can do something for 20 grand?
this may be the dog shampoo talking, but for 20 grand, we will decorate your office...
and whack an employee of your choosing.
Hey, Roomie!
hello... Roomie.
those are beautiful.
they're for you from the girls.
they felt terrible about breaking your mirror.
Oh. You mean my serving dish.
Oh, you haven't been upstairs yet.
Gaby! - But look how beautiful.
I'm going to church.
weren't you just there?
I need to do some more praying. Apparently, it's not working.
if you're looking for the owner, that's me.
are you aware that you're blocking my driveway?
Yeah. Are you aware that you illegally entered my vehicle?
well, I needed to get your attention. - Doesn't make it legal.
Oh, don't try to make this my fault. Blocking my driveway is illegal.
Yes, but breaking into my car is criminal.
Really? Let's call 9-1-1. I'd love to get a policeman's opinion on that.
you just did.
Oh, my. You are a policeman.
detective Chuck Vance, Fairview p. d.
your neighbor Mrs. Tillman's a parolee. I was paying a routine call.
but now it appears that she's not the only dangerous woman on the street.
look, I-I don't know what laws I may have broken, but
unlawful trespass, tampering with a police vehicle, malicious mischief...
okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm just so frazzled today.
a friend of mine is staying with me, and her two girls are absolute monsters.
in fact, I don't suppose I could borrow your gun?
to shoot the children?
I was joking. - So was I.
I'm sorry I blocked your car.
I - I'm sorry that, um, I got into yours.
I'll tell that to the judge.
I'm sure you'll get off with community service.
wait.
what?
still joking.
I'm gonna get you! You come back here!
No! No! No!
Oh. Right. Girls! No running!
is that all you're gonna do?
of course not. Next time I 'll trip one of them.
or perhaps you could try taking a firmer hand.
Oh, please. I've tried everything.
I even bought them a puppy just so I could threaten to kill it.
they asked if they could watch.
well, I can't take it anymore. Would you mind if I talked to them?
perhaps hearing it from somebody else would make the difference.
what are you saying, Bree?
you think you're a better mother than me?
well, not to cast aspersions on tripping and killing puppies, but there are other approaches.
okay, mother superior.
you think you can get those girls to behave? Be my guest.
Oh, and if the little one charges, move.
it's like someone dropping a sack of flour off the empire state building.
girls, I need to talk to you.
not now. We're playing death match.
we do not fight in this house with pillows made of hand-dyed silk.
now I am gonna count to three.
one... Two...
do you know what happens after three?
four?
put the pillows down.
now, I am sure you've heard the expression, "my house, my rules.
no.
well, there is an expression - "my house, my rules.
and as long as you are staying here with me, you will behave properly.
you will mind your manners, you will do your chores.
you will listen when spoken to.
and - Where are they going?
hmm? I wasn't paying attention. What were you telling 'em?
girls, get back here!
don't smirk.
the key to discipline is consistency. And I will not give up.
neither will they, Bree.
neither will they.
wow, if I knew Tom was working with so many handsome rich men,
I would have worn a lower top.
lower? I think you would call that a belt.
will you look at this? He's kept us waiting 45 minutes.
good to see being married to the boss gave us the leg up.
if he keeps us waiting any longer,
I know two legs that won't be going up.
sorry about the wait.
I just got off the phone with London. Closed a deal worth $10 million. Phyllis?
okay, ladies, I have 15 minutes, and they are all yours.
that is all we need.
the overall look we're going for is very warm and inviting.
we're thinking soft wood, an overstuffed linen sofa, that sounds great, but I already know what I want.
ripped that out of a magazine.
this is Donald Trump's office.
isn't it cool?
I- I love that desk- Black marble and chrome.
a - and look at that samural sword and those dragon lamps.
I'm sorry. Are you planning to take over the world with your death ray?
I think this is impressive.
but... It's not you.
you'd need a telephone book to sit behind that desk.
Lynette, if this is what our client wants...
thank you, Renee.
you know, when Doug played for the Yankees, "the Donald" invited us on his yacht all the time.
I'll just call his assistant and find out where they got the desk.
the Donald.
you're wondering if you can pull off "the Tom," aren't you?
no.
good, because the idea of you in an office like this
is totally workable.
why don't we get some pieces in here over the weekend?
and you can take a look on Monday.
now that is the attitude I like-can-do.
I have a meeting. Great work, everyone.
see Phyllis on the way out. She'll validate your parking.
wow, that was easy.
I know a place that has these fabulous chrome and steel pieces.
we're not doing that. - Why not?
because that's not Tom.
he's definitely a soft wood kind of guy.
okay, lesson one - Tom is the client.
if he wants a big shot office, he gets it.
and lesson two - No man wants to be referred to as "soft wood.
Felicia. What are you doing here?
I'm sorry to drop by without calling. Is this a bad time?
Yeah, it is. Uh, I'm in the middle of cooking dinner.
of course. I - I just...
I was missing Beth so much, and...
then I remembered that part of her was still alive somewhere.
could you spare a few minutes for a woman who lost her only child?
sure. Come in.
smells good. - Oh, it's for Paul. Chicken pot pie.
right. You said you were cooking for him.
that's so thoughtful.
well, just trying to be a good friend.
I hope that we can be friends, too.
you do? You and me? Friends?
I know what you're thinking.
what I did to Paul was horrible, but thank god, he's forgiven me, and now I just want things back to normal.
I even got this glove so people wouldn't be put off by me.
what, you-you mean the finger thing?
Oh, people hardly notice it. But the glove is good.
what's wrong? - I... Get these migraines.
could I trouble you for some aspirin?
sure. Hang on.
this smells wonderful.
I wouldn't begin to know how to make a pot pie.
well, the crust is store-bought.
but don't tell Paul, okay?
don't you worry.
I know how to keep a secret.
toxin, death is both slow and agonizing.
what did I tell you, dear?
it's so much better than a bullet.
initial symptoms include nausea and vomiting.
these are followed by metabolic acidosis and cardiovascular dysfunction.
he'll think it's his heart.
as if he had one.
and finally, acute renal failure and...
death.
and you know the best part?
I couldn't get near Paul's food if it weren't for you...
or at least that last little piece of you that's still alive in Susan.
it just goes to show...
you may be gone...
but we're still one heck of a team.
Susan, how's he doing?
I don't get it. He just keeps getting worse and worse.
I think I'm gonna have to start bringing him breakfast, too.
you're a good friend.
daddy! I missed you so much!
Oh, I missed you, too.
why don't you guys go wash up for dinner? Go on.
so tomorrow after school, they come back to me, right?
right.
Carlos, how did we get here?
we're talking like a divorced couple.
what do you want me to say?
just tell me how long this is gonna go on.
how long are you gonna be friends with Bree?
Carlos- - 'cause that is how long it's gonna go on.
what are you doing? - Giving my plant a drink.
why do you hate mommy so much?
I don't hate mommy.
I just...
I'm mad at something Bree did.
what did she do?
well... It's kind of a grown-up thing, honey.
you guys say that about everything you don't wanna talk about.
you're right.
sit.
you know grandma died.
but you never heard the story of how it happened.
Hey, have you seen our bank statement?
I'm in the middle of a quiz.
well, I think you might like this a lot better than...
are you having enough orgasms?
Oh! I just had one.
we actually have money!
we paid all of our bills, and we have money left over.
well, the insurance is covering your surgery 100%, and add that to the money you won playing poker
by the way, don't do that again-and we're finally out of the hole.
in fact, we can afford to move back into our old house.
Oh, that would be great.
but we can't until Paul's ready to leave.
well, he might be ready a little sooner if his new best buddy asked him.
I'm not gonna do that to Paul.
think of what he's been through. He's a wreck.
well, maybe moving out of a house filled with memories of Beth would be good for him.
am I supposed to believe that you are suddenly interested in Paul's well-being?
look, I don't like the guy. I never will.
but as long as you're taking him under your wing, why can't we get something out of it?
so...
now do you understand why I'm so upset?
I know it's a complicated story. You have any questions?
no, daddy. - Okay.
I'm gonna go grab my wallet, and we are gonna go get pizza.
Celia, come here.
you know what daddy just told me?
Bree killed grandma.
Hello, girls.
did you have a nice time at your father's last night?
well, now that you're back at my house, I'd like to try once again to discuss my rules.
that be okay?
Yes, Mrs. Van de Kamp.
Oh, hello, Gaby.
what is this? - Juanita's helping me make dinner.
good job.
now after you're done washing the brussels sprouts, you can help me set the table.
Yes, Mrs. Van de Kamp.
brussels sprouts? You do know the girls are eating here tonight?
Yes. Don't they like brussels sprouts?
sure... As projectiles.
well, they'll eat them tonight, or no cupcakes.
you actually left those out in plain sight?
have you learned nothing? You could lose the sideboard.
Oh, they won't touch them, not till I tell them they can.
thank you for straightening up, Celia.
now would you please help your sister in the kitchen?
okay. What the hell did you do to them?
Oh, I simply sat them down and explained what I expected of them while they're staying here.
Oh, cut the crap, Van de Kamp. Did you give 'em drugs? Threaten 'em?
children don't respond to threats.
they respond to structure provided with a firm hand.
so you hit them.
if you stick to my system, by the time you take these girls back to Carlos, they'll be perfectly behaved.
you're welcome.
Hey, sweetie. You can relax. She went upstairs.
no, I have to get this done.
do you want a cupcake?
Mrs. Van de Kamp says those are for after dinner.
well, Mrs. Van de Kamp isn't here.
I'm not saying I love this more than you and Celia, but if the three of you fell in a pool, and I could only save two, one of you would finally get her own room.
here. Sneak this upstairs. Eat it later.
no, thanks. I'll have an apple.
what did she do to you? ! how did she break you? !
okay, those go right in front of the desk. - Yes, ma'am.
and watch the... Yeah. Thank you.
uh, what's going on? I told the movers to be here at 11: 00.
Yeah. I made a teensy change.
and this is not the furniture I ordered.
again, teensy change.
Oh, my god. I can't believe you did this behind my back.
we're supposed to be a team.
I almost bought you a coffee this morning without you even asking.
but you didn't.
Yeah, and I felt bad about it... Till now.
I've got two dragon lamps in my car.
what the hell am I supposed to do with those?
I'm sorry, but trust me, I'm saving us time.
how? Tom said what he wants.
Tom said what he thinks he wants.
I know what he really wants.
and you have to admit, looks pretty good, doesn't it?
all comfy and cozy...
Yeah, Lynette, you did a great job ignoring what he asked for.
all that's missing is an antique jar for tom to put his testicles in.
Juanita, what is it? - Get away! Get away!
you're just having a nightmare!
honest, everything is okay!
they won't come out. - Not even for you?
Nope. That's how scared you got them.
I swear, I didn't do anything.
I went in to check on them, and they got hysterical.
Carlos, it's me. Where are you?
the girls won't come out for anyone except their daddy.
it's about time!
okay, Carlos... Who the hell are you?
detective Vance, Fairview p. d.
we got a 9-1-1 call from 2 girls who say that their mom's crazy friend is trying to kill them.
what?
hello again.
I guess you found someone to loan you that gun.
okay. I spoke with the girls.
they're pretty sure that Mrs. Van de Kamp here was trying to murder them.
well, that's preposterous. Why would they say such a thing?
well, that's not all they said.
what's with the panicked phone calls?
it's nothing. The girls got all freaked out and called the police.
freaked out about what?
are you the father? - Yeah. Carlos Solis.
detective Vance.
Mr. Solis, did you tell your daughter that Mrs. Van de Kamp killed your mother?
did you tell her that, sir?
I think I know what this is.
me and the girls were talking about my mother's death, and I said being apart from their mom felt almost as bad, and I said that I blamed Bree for that.
they must have gotten confused.
Yeah, well, don't be mad at them.
it's hard on kids when their parents are apart.
it's actually kind of funny if you think about it.
I mean, not "funny" funny, but sad... Funny.
daddy! - Hey, girls...
so sorry to have dragged you out here in the middle of the night.
no problem. I hope everything... You know, works out.
let me walk you to your car.
let's go pack your stuff. I'm taking you home.
I'm glad you didn't kill someone.
I'd have felt pretty dumb for not arresting you when I had the chance.
uh, tell me something.
when someone calls 9-1-1, don't they usually just send a patrolman?
I was at dispatch when the call came through.
when I heard the address, I said, "I'll take it.
I wanted to see you again.
Really? About what?
your neighbor, Mrs. Tillman.
here's my card.
if you see anything suspicious, I want you to call me.
okay.
or even if you don't.
what is it about you? I never have a clue what you're thinking.
I'm a detective. I find clues. I don't give them.
good night, citizen.
good night, detective.
they are almost done packing.
I can't believe you told them.
Juanita wanted to know why we were fighting. I told her the truth.
great. So now they think mommy walked out on daddy to live with the lady that killed grandma?
well, that is kind of what you did.
and I never said that Bree killed their grandma.
I said that she helped the person who did kill her get away with it.
Yes. She was protecting her child, which is exactly what we'd do if it was our kid in trouble.
families stick together.
then why are you living here?
why did you pick Bree over me?
Carlos, thank you for not saying anything in front of that policeman.
you think I did this for you?
well, I just assumed- - That was for Andrew.
he was a kid when all this happened. You weren't.
okay, lay off her, Carlos. She's apologized again and again.
well, I don't forgive her, and as long as you're taking her side, I don't forgive you, either.
we're ready, daddy. - Let's go home.
I'm sorry. I just keep waiting for this to blow over.
we have to face it, Gaby. This is never gonna blow over.
so what am I gonna do?
you're gonna go home to your husband.
I feel guilty enough about Carlos losing his mother.
I will not be responsible for him losing his wife.
that means you and me...
Yeah. I know.
I'll call you, okay?
please... Don't.
these look delicious. Nicely done.
well, I had help.
I just stirred the batter.
a very important job, so you get to try the first one.
no.
I don't want to spoil my dinner.
please?
I want to know that they taste good, and I'm allergic to nuts.
well, I... I guess that makes me the... Guinea pig.
best I've ever tasted.
but... Not good enough to finish?
they're terrible, aren't they?
you know what? I'm gonna toss these and start again.
no. You can't. I...
I just didn't want to break my diet...
but who can resist with these?
they're really good?
like nothing I have ever eaten.
I'm gonna get you some milk to wash that down.
no, I can't stay.
I, uh...
need to go buy a new handbag.
what's wrong with that one?
my keys...
you're not still mad at me, are you?
no. I'm good.
because I think we're gonna see a happy client walk out of his new office.
any second now.
you two...
I love it!
you do? - Love it!
you do!
well, you live with someone for 25 years, you might know a thing or two about a thing or two.
come on.
but... That's not...
where we told them to put the desk. You're right, Lynette.
what are you talking about? It's perfect right here.
I mean, look at this!
the only way it could be more intimidating is if flames shot out of it.
is there any way that we could...
Nah! Forget it.
and what is it about leather that just says, "I own your ass.
Oh, I'm out of order? No, you're out of order. Get out!
so you really like this? - I love it.
you know, I was a little worried about how this was gonna work out, but you came through.
I mean, you captured it. It's amazing.
I'll tell you what's amazing
the rug that we haven't put down yet.
let's get to that showroom, Lynette, before some other hotshot takes it.
thanks again.
how could you do that?
do what? Make our customer happy?
Oh, he's kidding himself. That testosterone trap is not Tom.
maybe it's not the Tom who's been pitching in with carpool the past few years, but the Tom who's running this company?
Yeah, it is, and you need to accept that.
you're not gonna accept that.
no.
you cannot be serious. - What are you talking about?
this.
this whole master of the universe playroom.
I - I thought you liked it.
I... Hate it.
then why did you do it this way?
I didn't! I had a whole other office in here!
then Renee came and changed it.
then good for Renee. At least one of you gets me.
this office is not who you are.
you're a great, down-to-earth guy, not some jerk that has to show people how powerful he is.
I am powerful...
and I do need to show it.
I am surrounded by gunslinger kids who'd steal this job in a heartbeat if they weren't a little scared of me.
I have a role to play, and I play it damn well, and I'm sorry if that threatens you.
it doesn't threaten me.
I just don't want to lose the guy I married.
Oh, You mean Tom the screwup?
the one who couldn't make a "go" of the pizza parlor?
the one you could always put your arm around at the end of the day, and say, "it's okay, honey. I'll get us through"?
don't make it sound like I'm not glad you're succeeding, 'cause I am.
you say that. You say that all the time, but I am waiting for a sign to see that you actually mean it.
and I thought this office was that sign.
I mean, I walked in here and I thought, "how great is this? She gets it.
she's happy. She's proud of me.
my mistake.
yeah? - Ed Nicks. You in?
Yes.
W - we can't end the conversation like this.
I have to take this call.
Hey, Eddie, how are ya?
what, are you kidding?
the chance to kick your ass at golf and take your money?
you don't have to ask me twice. Tuesday works.
Yeah, I'll let you hit from the ladies' tees.
no good, huh? - No, I'm just not very hungry these days.
are you okay? - A little dizzy.
sit. I'll clean up.
Oh, um, you took down Beth's painting?
Yeah. Some days it's nice to be reminded of her, but others... It's too many memories.
did you ever think living in this house might be one of the reasons you feel so bad?
maybe you could use a change of scenery?
you mean leave Fairview? - No, no, no, just this house.
I couldn't do that to you.
where you gonna find another tenant?
well, that's the great part.
Mike and I have been saving up, and now we're ready to move back in.
I'm an idiot.
what?
very impressive, Susan.
I actually thought you gave a damn about me.
what are you talking about? Of course I do.
bringing me food, checking in on me
it was a masterful performance.
must have been hard being patient, though
not show your hand too soon.
you don't give a crap about me.
it's this house you wanted.
no, Paul, that's not true.
I swear, Mike suggested it, and
Mike. Of course he's in on it.
I bet you had a hell of a time planning out the whole thing.
I knew nobody on this street cared about me, but for you to pretend you did just to get something out of me, that makes you the worst one of all!
Paul, please.
leave me alone!
and this time, I mean it.
people do good deeds for many reasons, but sometimes good deeds have bad consequences.
correcting a colleague's mistake could breed resentment.
opening one's home to a friend can damage that friendship.
trying to bring a spouse closer might push her further away.
that's why there's an old expression about helping people
no good deed... Goes unpunished.
there was flirtation.
here's my card. If you see anything suspicious, - I want you to call me... or even if you don't. - There was confrontation.
after all those years that I supported you, took a backseat to your career, you couldn't do the same for me.
Oh! Aah! - There was a fight.
leave me alone!
and... there were consequences.
Susan Delfino was charitable to a fault.
she just couldn't resist lending a hand.
there wasn't a lost pet she could ignore...
a girl in uniform she could refuse...
or a struggling artist she could say no to.
so when it came to a neighbor in need...
Oh, my God. Paul, what happened?
Susan was only too eager to help.
I started having chest pains, passed out, came to, dialed 9-1-1.
they've been running tests all night.
well, I'm gonna be here for you till they figure it out.
I brought you these... magazines, water.
you're unbelievable.
I've got a street full of neighbors, and the only one who comes to see me is the woman I yelled at.
sorry about that. - It was my fault.
I shouldn't have asked you about getting my house back.
I sounded like a vulture.
Mr... Young, we've got your test results.
could you excuse us for a moment, Susan?
Oh, yeah. I'll wait outside.
well, good news. Your E. K.G. came back normal.
so it's not a heart attack? - It's not a heart attack.
says here you've been experiencing dizziness, - nausea, stomach cramps. - That's right. What do you think it is?
I think unless you've been poisoned or you're pregnant, it's probably just stress.
poisoned?
Yeah. I remember this case when I was an intern.
a man came in with the same symptoms.
turns out his wife was putting antifreeze in his oatmeal.
little bit every day so it wasn't obvious.
but eventually, it killed him.
good lesson for all of us... don't piss off the old lady.
what did he say?
he thinks it's stress.
just stress?
that's a relief. So you must be starving.
what can I make you for dinner tonight?
Yes, Susan Delfino just couldn't resist lending a hand to a neighbor in trouble.
I'm sure anything you bring will be a huge help to me.
which was about to cause her some trouble of her own.
no matter how secure we are, we all experience moments of dread.
it may be just before we open our credit card bill...
or hand over a note from our teacher...
or step on the scale after a week away from the gym.
Yes, we all experience moments of dread, and sometimes we have no one to blame...
but ourselves.
daddy's home. - How are my...
bloody Stranger Two"? She can't watch this!
daddy, no!
look, this is about some... stranger who comes to town and starts murdering slutty teenagers!
Yeah. It's a good lesson for when she's older.
don't be a slutty teenager.
Gaby, this is way too violent.
Oh, the kid's used to violence.
you've seen me make her eat carrots.
besides, Juanita knows the movie's fake.
right, honey?
Duh. There's no way one spear gun could shoot through three heads in real life.
exactly. Two, maybe.
maybe.
Oh, Carlos, relax.
Juanita's tough. She'll be fine.
Aah! He's out there!
Oh! Calm down, sweetie. Who's out there?
the bloody stranger.
he was standing on our lawn looking at our house.
the bloody stranger. Nice.
no, honey, we talked about this, remember?
how it was all pretend?
can I sleep in here with you guys?
you can sleep with her. I'm gonna sleep in your bed.
Celia's in my bed.
then I'll sleep in Celia's bed.
she wet her bed.
come on in.
look who's home in time for dinner! - Yeah, well, I couldn't miss spaghetti night.
spaghetti night's Tuesday, dad.
you made it home for taco night. - Taco night?
ay, caramba!
hey... no. I'm kidding. Mwah.
Hey, your mom made a lovely dinner, so the least that I could do was bring home dessert.
plane tickets? - That's right.
I planned the family vacation this year. - You did what?
seven days, six nights at the royal Kailua spa and resort in... Hawaii.
Whoo! Dad!
well done, sir! - I've never been there!
you bought the tickets without talking to me first?
okay. Not exactly "Wow, Tom, you're the greatest husband in the world.
but I told you, I already planned our vacation, just like I've been doing for the last 16 years.
well, there you go. You deserve a year off.
wait until you see - the waterslides at this place. - Cool!
Yeah. Yeah, cool. Except I just spent two weeks mapping out a route for a camping trip, - and I put a deposit down on an R. V. - Okay, so we eat the deposit.
wish I could eat it right now.
and I told my sister we'd stop by and visit on the way.
we get back from Hawaii, we fly her out to see us here...
boom! Problem solved.
and yet still no "You're the greatest husband in the world"?
Oh, my God.
first class?
you are the greatest husband in the world!
Aah! Oh, my God! We're going to Hawaii! Aah!
Yes! So lucky! Ohh.
Yeah.
Hawaii.
principal Hobson!
principal Hobson?
principal Hobson!
uh... Susan! Hey! Great to see you!
did you get my e-mails? I sent you, like, ten.
e-mails? No.
Oh. Well, in the first one... - All right. I got them.
and I would be glad to give you your job back, - but I'm afraid it just isn't gonna happen. - Oh...
why not?
Susan, you can't be surprised that there are consequences when you show up on the internet holding a feather duster and wearing a purple bra?
that was very specific.
well, I... I had to verify the claims in order to...
my point is, the damage was done.
I know. I made a mistake.
but I feel like I deserve a second chance.
if it were up to me, I would give you that chance.
but you know private schools.
the parents' council has all the power.
so... if I were to win them over...
well, it would be a start.
thank you. I'll take it from here.
Oh, and I promise, no feather duster, no purple bra.
and no black bustier.
nice talking to you.
Oh, Detective Vance. I was just, um, heading out.
I won't keep you. I just stopped by to give you another card, - to replace the one you lost. - What makes you think I lost it?
I gave it to you two days ago. You never called me, - so I'm assuming you lost it. - No. I didn't.
now, is that nice?
I give you a graceful way to spare my feelings, and you clobber me with facts.
you sure you didn't lose it?
quite sure. In fact, it's right here in my purse.
you didn't throw it away.
that must mean you were thinking of calling.
look...
this is my second try. I can't ask you again.
is that an ultimatum? - It's a fact of courtship...
twice is charmingly persistent. Once more and I'm stalking you.
so you're courting me? - I'm trying to. When will you stop playing hard to get?
maybe when you stop playing hard to want.
you see how much you enjoy smacking me down? - Mm.
why pass up a chance to do it all night?
come on. One dinner.
fine. This Thursday, 8: 00 p. m.
great. See you then.
I thought you were heading out.
right.
you... want me to test a tuna noodle casserole?
is that a problem?
well, normally we test stuff like soil samples and ground water, but sure, I can do it. What are you looking for?
antifreeze.
Hey. What are you doing tonight?
a friend of mine's playing at a jazz club. - Oh, thanks, Renee, but I have a date.
if you don't want to come, just say so.
you don't have to make stuff up. - No! I really do have a date.
is that so hard to believe? - Uh, slightly.
so who is he?
he's a detective. His name is Chuck.
Chuck Vance.
well, don't stop. I want to hear it all.
actually, that's all I know. - That's it? And you agreed to go out with him?
I never date a guy until I've done a complete background check.
maybe I should just google him. - Amateur.
give me his name and I will find out everything worth knowing...
marital history, net worth, results of his last physical.
the physical seems excessive.
that's what I thought till I spent a weekend pinned under a dead linebacker.
why would you let her watch something called "Bloody Stranger Two"?
I know, I know. I'm an idiot. Now she's having nightmares - and crawling into our bed every night. - When I was a kid, I had bad dreams like you wouldn't believe... jumping-out-of-bed, running-down-the-hall-screaming kind of dreams.
so what'd you do? - Guess I outgrew 'em.
you did?
Juanita, come here!
what are you doing? - I figured you could talk to her.
you know, give her one of those "it gets better" speeches you gays love so much.
sweetie, Lee wants to talk to you.
so your mom says you've been having nightmares.
what are they about?
I see this creepy guy standing on our lawn.
Oh, you poor thing.
you know, when I was little, I had nightmares, too.
Really? - Yeah.
my brother told me that there was a hospital for the criminally insane on the outskirts of town.
and at night, the inmates would escape and kidnap little boys and girls.
but it's not real. His brother was just trying to scare him.
Oh, no. It was totally real.
one summer, three kids went missing.
until they found them... - Right.
about a month later... in a ravine.
alive!
no. Come on. They were in a ravine.
what good ever comes out of a ravine?
what the hell was that?
I'm just showing her there's nothing to be frightened of.
my story's way scarier than hers.
okay. So Cindy's in charge of decorations,
Abby, you're handling music...
Oh, sorry. Sorry. Don't let me interrupt.
Susan, what are you doing here?
I heard you guys were planning an Open House Night, and I'd love to pitch in. How can I help?
let's see. You're legendary for your cleaning abilities.
that didn't take long.
do you need any refreshments? I could make something.
Thanks, but if we need any help, we'll call you.
is it still 99 cents a minute?
okay, uh...
looks like we should just get this out there.
my family had a really crappy year.
uh, I did some things that I am not proud of.
but I was a damn good teacher when I was at this school.
and I was hoping that you ladies might eventually support hiring me back.
you want to teach here again?
I think the parents' council might have a big problem with that.
look, I... I'm not asking for your forgiveness...
just a chance to earn it.
let me do something for Open House.
I really do wanna help.
okay. How about you pick up the streamers?
streamers?
if you can handle it.
just be careful not to confuse them with tassels.
meeting adjourned.
I shouldn't even look at this.
it feels like such an intrusion.
and besides, he'll be here any minute.
then I'm just in the nick of time.
you found something bad?
well, for me, his salary alone makes him a non-starter.
but you may be more interested in what's on page three.
is he a dirty cop? Or a democrat?
worse.
Hello, Chuck.
I was afraid I was early, but, uh...
looks like you're all ready.
Oh, I'm ready, all right. Shall we?
hope this is okay. You like Italian, right?
everybody likes Italian.
Oh, it's fine. So let's talk.
tell me about yourself. Tell me everything.
okay, what do you want to know?
Oh, whatever you think is, hmm... pertinent.
okay. Um, I was born in Pennsylvania.
I played some ball in college.
um, I have a degree... criminology.
interesting.
anything else?
well, I have two kids.
Oh. So you've been married.
Yeah. Didn't work out.
I hope you don't judge me for that.
Oh, no. Not for that.
is something wrong, Bree?
I'm just wondering when you were going to tell me that you're still married.
I see you've done due diligence.
did your source happen to mention that I filed for divorce last Spring?
and that it hasn't gone through, so technically, you're still married.
you should have told me. - We haven't even ordered yet.
you expect me to lead with that?
Hey, I'm technically married. The chicken looks good.
you shouldn't be dating at all until your divorce is final.
what if you and your wife reconcile? - I haven't spoken to my wife in a year without my lawyer present.
you can't blame me for doing a simple background check.
hell, no. I'm sure you want to avoid another mistake like your second husband, the hit-and-run driver.
Orson, was it?
what?
tell me, who was creepier... him or that pharmacist who killed himself while you were dating?
where did you hear that?
I pulled your police file.
I have a file?
and you pulled it.
how dare you investigate me before our date!
say that again, and this time, listen for the irony.
there is no comparison to what I did.
you could have been dangerous! I have to protect myself.
Oh, women can be dangerous, too,
especially ones who own four handguns and a 30-06 hunting rifle. What's up with that?
this is outrageous.
you are treating me like a common criminal!
what can I get you folks to start?
I will not be ordering. I want to go home now.
come on, Bree. Calm down. Have a drink.
I don't drink. Wasn't that in my file?
someone's slipping.
what are you doing?
hmm? What do you think I'm doing?
I think you're wasting your time,
much as I did when I planned this year's vacation.
we should have discussed this.
I wanted to surprise you.
I wasn't surprised. I was blindsided.
you may call all the shots at work, but you're not the C. F.O. of this family.
you're right.
for what it's worth, your road trip sounds amazing.
I just don't think it's gonna pan out for this summer.
but you made a hell of a great start for next year's trip.
don't pull that management trick on me.
what trick? - The "yes" sandwich.
start with a compliment, lower the boom, end with a compliment. It's the oldest trick in business, - and I taught it to you. - Lynette, I already promised Hawaii to the kids.
you want me to take it away? You saw how excited they were.
only because they've never had a lavish vacation before.
give me the same budget, and I'll make my trip - sound twice as good as yours. - Oh, I would love to see you try.
okay, then. Game on.
we'll, um, we'll sit the kids down, we'll each make our presentation. Let them decide.
sounds fair to me. Game on.
okay. Game on.
honey.
I'm not turned on. You're a very handsome man.
we're not gonna have sex.
that's a "no" sandwich.
level with me, Bree. Do I still have a chance with you?
none whatsoever.
then this can't make things any worse.
that's right. Keep driving, buddy.
why'd you do that? - Get in, Violet.
Oh, my god. You couldn't have dropped me off before you pick up a prostitute?
you arresting me, Chuck?
just taking you to the women's shelter.
so what is this, your good deed for the night?
you trying to impress your date?
no. That ship has sailed. She hates me more than you do.
Why? What's wrong with him?
my opinion isn't any of your concern, miss.
you're better off without her, Chuck.
this one's got a stick up her ass.
and what qualifies you to make such snap judgments - about people you've just met? - I'm a hooker. It's what I do.
here we are, and I'm watching to make sure you go in.
you know I'm just gonna be back on that corner tomorrow.
Yeah, well, that's tomorrow's problem.
when are you gonna give up?
what I am now... That's all I'm ever gonna be.
you think so?
did you know that ten years ago,
Bree here was turning tricks just like you?
how dare you.
Bree, she needs to hear this.
I must have hauled her ass in 50 times.
then one day, she said, "I'm better than this.
she got herself to school.
before you knew it, she had a first class catering company, so don't try to tell me that you can't make a better life for yourself.
you were really on the street?
actually, I...
I don't like to talk about that part of my life.
I get it.
look at you now, huh?
it was really nice to meet you.
likewise.
thank you, Chuck.
don't mention it.
I know. Way outta line.
you said I had no chance, so I figured, what the hell.
home?
Yes, please.
you were right. Found trace amounts of antifreeze,
but don't worry. Wouldn't have killed you.
what would happen if I ate one of these casseroles every day?
well, for one thing, you'd get tired of tuna casserole.
Ahem. If you repeatedly consumed ethylene glycol, your heart would start to fail,
your kidneys would give out. Eventually, you'd die.
it'd be a nasty way to go.
I can only imagine.
what are you doing?
I thought I was borrowing Lynette's tent.
turns out I borrowed a nylon bag of death.
why are you setting up the tent?
for Juanita. I wanna prove to her there's no scary guy on the lawn.
I figured if she spends the night camping out here, she'll get over it.
so the kid is scared there's a killer lurking outside at night, and your solution is to make her sleep out here?
not alone, you dope. You'll be with her.
me?
Yeah. What if she's right?
what if there is a killer... Or it's cold?
Oh. Forget it.
I got an early meeting tomorrow, and I'm not going in half asleep because I slept on my lawn.
you caused this problem. You fix it, tonight.
and stop pouting. It's fun to sleep outside.
I'm sure it is.
that must be why the homeless are always so cheery!
come in.
after our date... or rather, non-date...
I was very confused.
makes two of us.
I was... Offended when you didn't tell me the truth about your marriage and oddly touched when you told a complete stranger I was a whore.
well, if you like that, you should wait till Valentine's Day.
I wanted to know your secrets right away, and I didn't want to tell you mine until I felt I could trust you,
and that... Wasn't fair.
I was no better.
when did dating become so complicated?
we're not kids anymore.
we've both had our hearts kicked around.
I guess it's made us a little gun-shy...
if "gun-shy" is the right word for a woman with an arsenal as big as yours.
so what do we do?
I say...
we forget about the crazy digging for dirt that we both did and just have a normal first date.
all right.
when?
well, it is lunchtime.
why not?
I know this little Indian place that does an amazing lamb vindaloo.
how'd you know I like Indian food?
I'd rather not say.
I don't even know why I wanna work at that school again.
Ugh, those smug cliquey moms.
I mean, can you believe that Dana gave me streamer duty?
it's positively awful.
so tell me, how is Paul?
I hear he went to the hospital?
he thought he was having a heart attack,
but the test results came back negative.
do the doctors know what caused it?
they think it's stress,
but I'm worried about him.
Oh, don't be.
well, I think he should go back and have more tests done.
he'll be fine.
as a nurse, I saw time and again that the best prescription for stress is rest and good food.
so sweet of you to make these cookies for him.
well, yeah, I hope it cheers him up.
I'm sure it's just what the doctor ordered.
well... I wish I could do more.
Oh, Susan.
you're doing more for Paul than you can possibly know.
the Grand Canyon
it took six million years to form.
sequoia national forest...
a soaring monument to nature's majesty.
so that's our vacation?
looking at trees and a hole in the ground?
now, now, kids, your mom worked hard on this. Be kind.
Yeah. Yeah, if the grand canyon isn't your scene...
did she say "scene"?
you're bound to love our next stop...
the screaminator.
seven minutes of sheer roller coaster terror.
responsible parenting" magazine calls it the worst idea since the caffeinated juice box.
that's awesome. Ooh.
that sounds really... Oh, me likely that.
that's very sweet! - Any and all of these thrilling destinations are available to us.
we just point the R. V... and drive.
all right! - Whoo!
Yes! Oh, man, I can't wait.
Ooh, I forget about the R. V.
won't it be a little cramped now that we have Paige?
Oh, maybe your dad's right. Maybe we shouldn't take the R. V.
maybe we should take...
the road juggernaut 8000.
state-of-the-art entertainment system,
six private sleeping compartments,
and two full baths,
one of which Justin Bieber used on his last tour to make...
water balloons.
shut up! Shut up!
I'm blown away right now! We are going on vacation!
follow that, Hawaii.
will you take that off?
no.
Juanita, you look ridiculous.
I don't care how I look.
I don't want that killer guy to chop off my head.
first of all, a helmet wouldn't keep him from chopping off your head.
it would just mean I'd have to clean it before I gave it back to Parker. Second, there is no killer guy.
it's an actor in a movie. - But I'm still scared.
it's okay to be scared. It's even fun sometimes.
but you can't let that scared come from inside your own head, and you have to be able to calm it down if it does.
what's that?
it's people walking by, Juanita.
this is what I'm talking about.
this is where you take charge of your fear.
mama, I think it's the killer.
no, it's not, Juanita.
mom, look!
Oh! Who's out there?! Go away!
gotcha!
what the hell is wrong with you?!
I'm trying to help.
by giving me a heart attack... you thought that would help?
kinda did.
Oh, mom, you should've seen your face.
I just wanted to show you that not everything that looks scary actually is. See?
plastic.
it's like the movie. It looks scary, but it's fake.
exactly. I have to go. Bob's in the shower...
and he's about to pay for not liking my chicken pot pie.
so when you cast your vote tonight, kids, cast it for adventure, luxury, nature.
cause Hawaii has something for every Scavo, whether it is circling a smoking volcano in a helicopter
or swimming in crystal-clear waters with the dolphins.
it is the vacation of a lifetime.
Hawaii! Hawaii! Hawaii! Hawaii! Hawaii! Hawaii!
Hawaii! Hawaii!
Hawaii!
Hawaii! Whoo!
I didn't wanna do this. You know who else loves swimming in those crystal-clear waters?
nature's hungriest predator... the great white shark.
come on. There hasn't been a shark attack on the island in forever.
Really? Or did they just fail to find the evidence?
great whites tend to eat their victims.
what?
this is very, very unlikely to happen.
you're right. You're right.
I mean, especially if we all die first in...
a gruesome helicopter crash.
now you see why the natives call them death birds.
you... you think you're gonna be safer driving across country?
who knows the number one cause of accidental death?
Oh, I do. It's the car crash.
don't worry, kids. We're gonna hire a professional driver.
it won't be your dad.
guys, can we go upstairs and talk about this before we vote?
you bet.
we await your verdict.
Yeah.
Aloha!
Aloha!
God, you are a hypocrite.
how?
ten years ago, Christmas,
we are standing in the scooter aisle at the toy store when I wanna choose the twins' big present.
you say, "Tom, when you start making the money, you can start making the decisions.
you've been sitting on that for a decade? Wow.
well, guess what. I make the money...
big money... more money than you ever did, so I get to decide how we spend it!
we're supposed to be equal partners.
I just wanted a say in the process. - No, you don't.
you wanna control the process like you always do. Watch it.
and then you feel that power slipping away, and you can't stand it.
you can't stand that I am running the show.
running the show? Are you kidding me?
we're talking about a family vacation...
not anymore we are not!
this is about how you can't handle my success.
no, you can't handle your success.
you've turned into a pompous ass!
maybe because it's turned you into a raging bitch.
Lee! I am warning you.
once was funny. This time, I will kill you.
get out of here!
how's Penny?
really upset.
she kept crying and saying how she didn't wanna choose.
I don't care where we go.
we'll take the road trip.
not the vacation, Tom.
she doesn't wanna choose which one of us to live with.
that is awful. Why would she think that?
why wouldn't she? She's seen it happen to three of her friends.
we have always fought, Tom, but never like that.
I know. It's gotta stop.
I agree.
I mean, I'm scared to open my mouth for fear you're gonna bite my head off.
I'm sorry. Was that an olive branch?
I'm no better, okay?
I miss dinner four nights a week, and even when I am here...
my mind is back at the office.
I think we're the ones who need a vacation.
alone.
Yeah.
not a big trip. Just a weekend.
we can... Get a chance to be together and work through all of this.
you're right.
we should do it this weekend.
you mean it?
Yeah.
I just have to check with the office.
okay.
but we are gonna do it, right?
you're not gonna get all busy at the last minute?
I said we'll do it, - And we'll do it, okay? - Okay. Okay.
Hello, Susan.
Hey, Dana. I got you your streamers.
I splurged and bought the good ones... flame-retardant.
good. Oh, my god. Are those cookies for the Open House?
Oh, well, actually...
you are a lifesaver. I just had two moms flake out on me.
Really?
uh... Well...
I thought that might happen, so I baked some just in case.
it's one of the things that makes a great teacher...
being ready for anything.
thank you.
you know, Susan, I haven't been your biggest supporter, but maybe I misjudged you.
thanks for these.
let's find some time to sit down with principal Hobson and talk about you coming back.
Yes!
Hello, Susan.
come on in. - Meals on wheels.
well, shoes. But "food on shoes" doesn't sound as good.
today's special is lasagna.
would you like me to put it on a plate for you, or do you wanna eat it later?
I think I'll have it now.
in fact, I'd love for you to join me.
Oh, I can't.
actually, I'm on my way to a function at M. J.'s school.
I'm sure you have a few minutes. Sit down.
uh... I'm kind of in a rush.
but it's not fair.
you go to all this trouble to bring me these delicious meals, and we never share them.
it pains me. Uh... - Paul, what's... Going on?
fine. You're in a hurry.
why don't you stab me with this? It'll be faster.
or are you getting your kicks watching me die slowly?
okay, I have no idea what you're talking about.
the food you're bringing me, Susan... it's poisoned.
what? That's not possible.
I had it tested. Come on. Have a bite.
Paul.
how could you do this to me?
is it because you want the house?
is it... is it because you hate me?
okay, you have to believe me. I never put poison in your food.
well, somebody did. Was it Mike?
No! It was just me. I... I'm the only one who...
what?
Oh, my god.
the cookies. I... I've gotta go. I've gotta get to the school!
Oh, Cindy, Cindy. The desserts...
the desserts, my cookies... have they put them out yet?
Oh! Yeah.
they're... Just...
I'm so sorry. Try the oatmeal raisin.
Kathy, um, do you know how many points these are?
you'll thank me tomorrow.
Susan? What did you do to the parents' council?
they love you.
Oh, great! Thanks for the cookie.
uh, which one of these is... is mine?
Ooh, I have no idea. We just put 'em all together.
Whoops! Sorry. Oh, silly me.
Clumsy!
if I can have everyone's attention for a moment, please?
Hi. I wanna welcome all our wonderful parents.
and I wanna thank the decorating committee and those who made the refreshments.
Oh, including Susan Delfino.
thank you, Susan, for those chocolate chip cookies.
Oh. Uh... You're welcome.
and about those cookies I made... don't eat them.
they're poison.
no, no, this isn't a joke. My cookies will kill you.
Oh, god.
that's her, officers.
Yes, no matter who we are, we all experience moments of dread...
when we ask ourselves, will anyone believe I'm innocent?
will my daughter be a child of divorce?
will this man break my heart?
are there things that go bump in the night?
and sometimes...
the answer...
is yes.
ladies.
Renee was charmed by the new neighbor.
dibs.
trying to protect Gaby, Carlos committed murder.
we are never gonna be able to tell anybody about this.
are you gonna be able to live with that?
and the women swore to keep the secret.
but then Bree received a warning.
when I was alive, Bree Van De Kamp was one of my closest friends.
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID. IT MAKES ME SICK. I'M GOING TO TELL.
maybe that's because we had so much in common.
like Bree, I also received a menacing letter
one that threatened to shatter the perfect life I had worked so hard to create.
you see, I had once committed a desperate act of my own.
and despite my best efforts to conceal it, someone found out and was determined to expose me.
I thought about telling my friends.
but I decided not to burden them.
I had hoped that with one final act, I could consign my deeds to history.
but I had forgotten that history...
has a way of repeating itself.
something interesting?
no. No, just a...Letter...
from a friend who I haven't, uh, heard from in a while.
you okay? - I'm fine.
I'm just annoyed,
because the, uh, postman left me Gaby's water bill again.
you go in. I'll just put it back in the box.
all right.
Oh, Karen. You scared me.
what are you doing out so late?
what am I, a cat?
I'm allowed to be out past 10: 00.
I'm sorry.
have you seen anyone near my mailbox?
what's the problem?
I just... Got a letter.
an obscene letter. - That's all?
you oughta be happy that someone still finds you obscene.
last week, I got called "sir" three times.
Karen! This is serious.
I need to find out who put this letter in my mailbox.
wow, you're really shaken up.
Yes, I am.
this is very upsetting, And I don't know what I'm going to do.
it's just a note, Bree. Let it go.
Yes, Bree Van De Kamp and I had so much in common.
we shared similar lives.
and now Bree found herself praying that we wouldn't share a similar fate.
in the divided world of the suburbs, everyone is looking for a way to connect.
they fend off loneliness with casual conversation.
they share old treasures with a young friend.
they help a neighbor make a difficult move.
but for Carlos and Gaby Solis, the only connection that mattered was the romantic one.
and when it came to maintaining it, Gaby was willing to pull out all the stops.
what are we celebrating? - A new record.
it's been 38 days since we last had sex, And that streak is ending tonight.
seriously, it's been that long? - 38 days.
that's like three years in hoo-hah time.
sweetie, I would love to, But I have way too much work to do.
Unh-unh. No, no. No excuses.
I changed the sheets, shaved my legs, And dumped the kids at Mccluskey's,
so drop your pants, cowboy, and saddle up.
Yes, ma'am.
don't feel bad. It happens to lots of men.
not to me. Not to us.
well, it has been 38 days. Maybe the poor little guy forgot what to do.
not helping.
listen, you've been under a lot of stress lately. So relax.
how about I give you a nice massage, We finish the champagne, and later we try again?
Gaby, thanks, but it's not gonna work, okay?
like Karlos, Susan Delfino was also feeling disconnected.
her guilt made the world a strange and scary place...
where she could be exposed at any moment.
Hey! Hold it right there!
I know what you did. - What?
Yeah, and you're not getting away with it.
you thought you could walk out with a case of soda And no one would notice?
I-I forgot those were down there.
Yeah. Right. I've never heard that one before.
ma'am, I'm gonna ask you to step away from the cart And keep your hands where I can see 'em.
everything okay here? - If you consider larceny okay.
Mrs. Delfino, On behalf of fairview market, I'd like to apologize for Kevin.
seems we're all paying the price For his rejection from the police academy.
Oh, well, excuse me for not wanting to live in a world
where people can commit crimes Without suffering the consequences.
you are a criminal.
I've known Mrs. Delfino for years.
she pays for the grapes she eats in the produce section.
she would never do anything bad.
sure, I would. - What?
you don't know me at all.
I'm a very bad person. I did a horrible thing.
I deserve to be punished.
let me cuff her. I have cuffs.
I brought 'em from home.
no one's getting cuffed. Just...
pay for the soda next time you come in.
no, no, no. No, you need to march me inside And make me pay now.
Mrs. Delfino - I'm serious.
fine. Take her in. - Copy that.
Yep. Did the crime.
doing the time.
dead man walking.
so what's the damage? An arm and a leg?
just an arm? - Not even a finger.
it's a cracked fitting. I swapped it out. It's no charge.
Really? The first guy I called Said I had to re-pipe the whole house.
Oh, it's a scam.
these pipes are top-of-the-line copper.
the guy that put 'em in did a great job.
how do you know? - It was me.
you just saved me 10 grand.
no wonder people say such good things about you.
well... What are neighbors for?
need anything else, just holler.
actually, there is one thing.
I'm a real estate developer, About to break ground on a new project,
and, uh, I'm looking for some help
local guys that I can trust.
you interested?
Hey, Mike. Got a minute?
Hey, Renee.
we're friends, right?
Oh, come on. You fixed my toilet for free.
um, that wasn't free. I sent you a bill.
you just haven't paid it.
anyway, look, here's the deal.
uh, Ben likes me. He just doesn't know it yet.
now I need to find that thing that we connect on.
you've been on the inside. What can you tell me about him?
well, he's got copper pipes.
something personal.
I saw a box of cheerios...
and a coffeemaker. He must like coffee.
unless it's for guests.
Oh, my god. I got more out of the cable guy, And he's deaf.
does he have any photos? Artwork? Think, Delfino, think!
okay. Okay.
there was this plaque from the mayor
something about his work with the elderly.
Really?
he likes the elderly?
well, I like the elderly.
since when?
old people are adorable.
I love their little raisin faces And those tennis balls they put on their walkers.
thanks for the tip... Friend.
mom! - Hey, how was your day?
awesome. Dad's hotel is so cool.
we went swimming in the pool and played marco polo
and cannonballed off the diving board.
why don't we have a pool?
and then we got hamburgers and french fries And super-sized cherry cola slushies.
sugar and caffeine. I guess you figured they were too young for meth?
it's just a slushie. - On a school night.
she's gonna be up till 2: 00 a. m. Just 'cause you couldn't say "no.
who wants to play mega monopoly?
it's just like regular monopoly but with more stuff.
you just keep playing and playing And playing and playing and playing...
Yeah. Way out of proportion.
look, now that we're really separated, I refuse to be the bad guy all the time.
you have got to learn to say "no." - I say it.
tonight when we walked past the pet shop, They wanted a spider monkey.
I said "no.
I'm serious. Things are different now.
I'm not gonna let this be the house of pain While you're living it up at the mtv beach house.
you're right. Things are different now.
for instance, I used to have to stand here and listen to this.
but now I'm thinking...No.
Hey, look at that. I'm getting pretty good at this "no" thing.
it's bad enough when we weren't even trying to have sex, But to try and fail?
well, do you think it might have something to do With the stress Carlos is under?
we're all under stress. You know what's stressful?
is not having sex for 39 1/2 days.
you're sounding a little callous.
I don't mean to. It's just, sex is important to us.
even in our toughest times, it's what always held us together.
if we don't have that, I'm worried what will happen to us.
I get that.
so... Come on, girls.
how can I spice things up in the bedroom?
is this actually happening?
Gabrielle Solis is asking us for sex tips?
I know! It's the apocalypse.
well, if you don't mind harsh lighting And blatant misogyny, you can always watch a porno.
watched one. Filmed one. Next.
this may shock you, But sometimes Mike and I like doing it in public.
those of us who wandered By santa's workshop at the christmas carnival-- Not that shocked.
you could try role-playing.
once, I dressed up in a french maid's costume,
and Orson pretended to be a stubborn stain, And why is everybody looking at me?
seriously, guys, I need some new moves.
well, there's this one mom at school-- And I promised I wouldn't use her name
Betty Cunningham--who hired a stripper to teach her How to give her husband a lap dance.
well, I don't know what a stripper could teach me, But it's worth a shot.
you really think that's gonna work?
why wouldn't it?
because...
I get where Carlos is coming from.
this kind of guilt can really mess with your head.
something you wanna talk about?
okay, the other day, I accidentally took a case of soda from the supermarket,
and the security guard started yelling at me.
it felt right to be publicly humiliated like that, And why is everybody looking at me?
cause there's a bucket of crazy where your head used to be.
so now I'm crazy.
I thought you said I could talk to you about this stuff.
you can, And we appreciate what you're grappling with,
but you cannot go around attracting attention like that.
it's not safe. - Exactly.
so knock it off and go get me some more coffee!
what? She likes to be yelled at.
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID. IT MAKES ME SICK. I'M GOING TO TELL.
Hey, you.
uh, I thought you were, uh, at work.
I pronounce the city of fairview Safe enough to have lunch with my girl.
Oh, that would be lovely, But I have something I need to do. Shoot.
Oh, yeah? Like what?
what?
unless it's a-- it's a big secret.
is it a big secret?
I'm sorry. You're right. I...
you don't owe me any explanations.
I just... I just need to know that we're okay.
my feelings for you have not changed, Just my schedule for the day.
well, that's good, Because suspicion can be a great trait in police work,
but it's horrible in a relationship.
just ask my ex.
I never wanna be that guy again.
hello there, Karen.
what happened to "liver spot" or "6 feet under
or one of your other cute nicknames?
no, no, I can't come in! I'm just dropping off another home-cooked meal!
what meal? What the hell are you yelling for?
just lift the napkin.
50 bucks. What's the catch?
don't look now, but do you see Ben over there?
subtle.
anyway, he has a soft spot for old people, And as far as he knows, so do I.
no, no, your crinkled little smile Is thanks enough for me.
are you petting me?
just say nice things about me to Ben.
tell him I bring you meals, that kind of stuff.
well, it's a pretty big favor for 50 bucks.
considering I don't like you, I'll do it for $100.
fine. Tomorrow I'll bring you a c-note and a jell-o mold. Deal?
Oh, Renee. Bless your heart. You're so good to me.
no, you're the one who enriches my life.
the joy I get...
hands off. He's gone.
Oh, my god.
you think I sent this?
you have any idea how this makes me feel?
forgive me. I didn't think it was possible To damage the self-esteem of a murderer.
a confessed murderer.
and this--this is the only way you can see me?
please.
I'm sorry.
I've just been so panicked since I got it.
it has the exact same wording as the letter Mary Alice received.
Yes. That's very weird.
but why are you so worked up about it?
I believe Mary Alice got a little worked up When she got hers.
but she was hiding something.
you aren't.
right?
of course not.
it's obviously just a cruel prank, But I still wanna know who's responsible.
it had to be someone who knew about the original note.
well, let's see.
obviously there's Martha Huber.
obviously she didn't send it.
then there's you, Susan, Lynette, Gaby.
I assume you've already asked them.
uh, actually, I-I haven't mentioned it to the girls yet.
I-I still haven't figured out exactly what it is.
well, whatever it is, Don't keep it to yourself.
if Mary Alice had shared her note with you girls...
things might have turned out...a whole different way.
you know it's recycling day. - So?
so it looks like you're about to put kitchen garbage in your recycling bin.
I hope I don't get punished.
Oh, here I am, dropping a turkey carcass in with the recycling.
and here I am, not giving a crap.
you got me.
can I bum one? My old lady made me quit.
free SAMPLES LIMIT 2 "PER" CUSTOMER
thank god. Those were from last week.
hello. Uh, Ben, isn't it? - Yes.
uh, listen, uh, I was just talking to Mrs. Mccluskey,
and I gotta say, I really misjudged you.
Yeah.
she was telling me all the ways you've helped her.
well, I like to think I'm doing god's work,
you know, until he takes her in her sleep or what have you.
Yeah, I don't know if you knew this,
but I'm quite involved with seniors myself.
get out!
look at us, having things in common.
so is there something else I can help you with?
actually, yes.
are you free tonight?
Hey, buddy.
what are you thinking for dinner tonight? Mexican? Chinese?
actually, there's a party at Rich Cohen's I was hoping to go to.
yeah? Don't hope too hard.
why not? - Remember when Rich turned 13?
it was the only bar mitzvah ever shut down by the police.
I don't trust his parents.
well, if you makes you feel better, they're out of town.
Ooh, an unsupervised party? Even better.
we're just gonna be Eating pizza and watching movies and stuff,
and Rich's older brother will be there.
perfect. Someone to buy the beer.
so you're saying "no"? Again?
I'm not saying no. I'm saying ask your dad.
Hey! I'm just dropping off a check.
hang on a sec. Parker has something he wants to ask you.
can I go to a party at Rich Cohen's house tonight?
what did your mom say?
his mom said he should ask his dad.
Oh. Well...
h-his parents are gonna be there, right?
Nope. No parents.
And...Rich Cohen-- Didn't something happen at his bar mitzvah?
lots of things happened-- drinking, pot smoking,
the Whittaker girl got pregnant.
it sounds like you already made up your mind here.
no, no, no. I have not made up my mind.
it is entirely up to you.
you hear that, dad? Entirely up to you.
Well...I-it seems like your mom doesn't think this is a good idea
I didn't say that.
I don't not think it's a good idea.
Oh, so you do do think it's a good idea.
I don't not think it's not... not...A good idea.
okay, I'm confused.
well, if your mom's not saying "no," I'm not saying "no" either.
well, if your dad's not saying "no," I'm sure as hell not going to say "no.
so is that a "yes"? - Well...
it's not a "no." - Sweet.
are you sure this thing is safe?
my son plays fireman on mine all the time.
do you wanna see a picture?
let's not make this sadder than it is.
all right, so my husband's having a little problem in the bedroom.
with his wiener? - Yes, with his...wiener.
well, you can relax, because I'm like a doctor,
and I see this problem all the time with older women.
older"?
excuse me. I don't think our ages are that far apart.
when were you born? - 1992.
me, too. All right, enough chitchat.
give me a taste of what I'm gonna learn here.
okay. I'd do ya. Let me try.
that was kind of advanced.
I was thinking maybe we could start with something simple, Like grinding on a chair.
okay, will you stop treating me like a grandma?
I do yoga and zumba and kickboxing.
I'm in excellent shape.
not bad. Okay, now ass up, legs out, and remember, slow is sexy.
Oh, my god.
okay.
a little harder than it looks.
no worries. You'll pick it up in no time.
six months tops. - What?!
I can't wait that long.
I need your moves, your body...
my ass, but basically I need to be you by tonight.
Hey, what are you doing tonight? - I'm headlining at double d's.
if I triple your pay, Would you mind being the opening act here?
Ben, I don't know how the food is, but I already love this restaurant.
we are the youngest people here.
Oh, this isn't a restaurant.
this is the senior center.
welcome to the Ben Faulkner function room.
we're not eating here, are we? - No, no, we're serving.
we can eat afterwards if there are, you know, leftovers.
Oh, fun.
uh, but i'm-- I'm a little underdressed.
there you go.
there. Now you're perfect.
Gaby, f. y. i. guys who used to be blind don't enjoy reliving it.
relax. You're gonna love this.
now just sit back and get ready for takeoff.
Yeah.
Wow. You've been working out.
I have... but that's not my ass.
it's a professional's.
meet Dakota. - What the hell? What is this?
a gift from your wife.
I work at double d's, Out by the interstate.
not the one by the airport that had the hepatitis scare.
you hired a stripper. - Only as a warm-up act.
then later on, she'll clear out, and it's just you and me for the main event.
Nope. Not doing this.
hang on. Idea. Sit down.
Oh! Okay. What are you doing? I don't...
Oh, my god. He's right. Your body-- it's like a dolphin.
give it a little spank.
nothing will fix his problem quicker than a little girl-on-girl action.
my "problem." You told her.
okay, quick. Make out with me.
do you have any idea how embarrassing this is for me?
thank you, doctor. You can go now.
how could you do that to me?
try to get our sex life back on track?
Carlos, even at our worst, this is the one thing that's always worked for us.
I just want us to get back to normal.
we're never going back to normal!
don't you understand that?!
what I did...
you can't wish it away.
it is with me all the time,
whether I'm awake Or asleep...
or trying to make love to you.
I'm sorry. I just wish there was something I could do.
there's not.
what's that? - I don't know.
is it good?
let me clue you in on something.
food is usually either good or free.
how come you're dressed so fancy?
because I'm on a date with that hot Aussie over there.
he just failed to mention what the date was.
Ben brought you to sling food dressed like that?
honey, I think he's messing with you.
I hope you had a good laugh.
be thankful I shoved that on your head.
there was another option.
Renee, stop.
Why? So you can mock me some more?
I wasn't mocking you.
okay, but I mean, you did kinda deserve it-- I mean, your whole "I heart old people" thing.
I was trying to find something we had in common, and now I know we have nothing in common.
you're a good person who does things like this, And...
I'm me.
you're not a good person? - No, ben, I'm not.
because truthfully, doing charity makes me nauseous.
Yeah, me, too. - What?
makes me uncomfortable, too, but I know why that is.
do you?
I don't want to talk about this.
Why? You afraid of saying something truthful?
when my mom...died, I was bounced around from relative to relative, Most of them dirt-poor.
we were on the receiving end of a lot of charity.
I spent plenty of time in places like this.
and I hated it.
they hand you something-- A, uh, a dented can of food or an ugly shirt.
and someone tells you,"say 'thank you' to the nice lady.
and you do, but secretly, you wanna scream,"i hate you.
I know what it's like to claw your way out of something.
look at us...
having things in common.
no STOPPING FIRE LANE
it's about time.
is there a problem, officer?
Yeah. You're parked in a fire zone.
darn the luck, I am.
well, sounds like somebody's gonna be slapped with a pretty steep fine.
Yeah, I should write you a ticket.
but if you promise not to do it again, I'll let you off with a warning.
what? Why would you do that?
cause I'm a new dad. - Oh, jeez.
Abigail Dorothy Brovka, 8 pounds, 6 ounces.
I'm just so happy, filled with love.
anything short of a triple murder,
and I'm pretty much looking the other way.
no, no. No, don't look the other way.
laws have been broken. There must be consequences.
I just wanna get home to my baby.
I mean, look at her, all wrapped up like the tastiest little burrito in fairview.
Oh, look at that. - Yeah.
that was not cool.
now fortunately for you, I always carry a backup.
are you kidding me? What do I have to do to get arrested here?
lady, people like you used to drive me nuts.
but nothing can faze me now that this sweet little girl's come into my life.
well, that sweet little girl-- she's got dumbo ears.
ma'am, you can turn around and put your hands behind your back.
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against you In a court of law.
Hey, Mike.
um, I,uh, I've got a bit of a problem. Maybe you can help me out with it.
I can try. What's the problem?
you.
how am I supposed to hire you when I can't get you bonded?
who knew? Mike delfino, suburban dad,
guy who keeps the neatest lawn on the block, - Ex con? - Yep.
and you were gonna mention this when?
look, I'm sorry. It's not something I tend to lead with When I meet somebody.
cause you're not that guy anymore.
that's right.
a bad cop tried to rape your girlfriend, and you fought him to protect her.
tell me why you wouldn't wanna be that guy anymore.
it was a long time ago.
I was a kid, and I've learned life's a lot more complicated than I thought.
Nah. Nah. Life is brutally simple.
life is getting what you want and protecting who you love...
and everything else is weakness.
a guy like you...
guy like you knows it.
Ben, if this is all just to tell me you can't use me, I understand.
no, no, no, no, I didn't say that. I said I couldn't bond you.
I can definitely use you.
I hope you've cooled off a bit.
Yeah.
well, uh, spending a few hours in a cell with a drunk transvestite will do that to you.
your baby's cute, by the way.
I swear she'll grow into those ears.
Thanks.
the guy you called to pick you up is here.
Carlos, thanks for coming.
I couldn't call Mike, and, uh, I didn't wanna upset the girls, so...
you okay?
they told me you assaulted a motorcycle cop.
actually, it was just a motorcycle.
that doesn't sound like you.
I've been...In this weird place lately.
I keep doing things, hoping to get caught.
does it help? - For five minutes.
and then I just feel guilty again.
I just don't know how to pull myself out of this.
I get it.
Gaby keeps pushing me to act like everything is normal.
I guess we're just supposed to stuff everything down and move on.
but that's impossible.
the girls are playing poker and acting like things are fine, and they're not.
it is nice to be able to talk about this.
it is.
do you wanna get some coffee?
sounds good.
Parker, it's me. It's getting late. Is everything okay?
everything is fine, m'lady.
who's this? - Toph.
if this is a booty call, Toph is ready to fill in.
where is parker? - I don't know, man.
it's kind of A "lord of the flies" situation here.
so... are we hooking up or what?
excuse me, excuse me. I'm looking for my son, Parker scavo
I'm hoping you know him.
keg stand! Keg stand!
and now I'm hoping you don't.
whoa, hold on. This is a private party.
uh, I'll just be a minute.
whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you, some kind of narc?
no, I'm just looking for my son, I swear. I'm not a narc.
exactly what a narc would say.
step aside, kid. - Lady, I said no.
listen to me. My son is here somewhere,
and he is probably drunk and probably terrified, and I have got to find him.
sorry. There's no way we're letting a narc into our party.
I am not...
okay. Would a narc do this?
legs!
keg stand! Keg stand!
this isn't what it looks like. I haven't been drinking.
I mean, a little. What are you doing here?
Parker called me to pick him up because he drank too much.
where is he? - He's in the car.
he sent me back because he lost his phone.
is he okay? He's covered in puke, which I'm hoping is--is his.
Oh, god.
this is your fault for letting him come here.
my fault? You could have stopped him.
Oh, please. You knew it was a bad idea.
you were just too busy testing me.
no, I was giving you a chance to stand up and be a father.
now we've got a 16-year-old son we have to clean off with a garden hose.
I guess you showed me.
he asleep? - Yeah.
I thought let him sober up before we punish him.
I know I shouldn't have let him go tonight.
but right now saying "yes" is the only move I've got.
move"? What is this?
some kind of game you're trying to win?
Lynette, you have no idea what this is like for me.
for 20 years, I had the same bedtime ritual.
I-I brushed my teeth, and I'd go look at each kid sleeping,
and no matter what crap happened during the day,
I knew the things that mattered were okay.
now my ritual...
I brush my teeth. So, yes.
I'm doing everything I can to make the little time
that I spend with them the best part of their week.
Wow. You're succeeding.
when I see them sprint out to the car, so excited to see daddy,
part of me thinks, great.
they're okay with this, and part of me thinks...
Oh, crap.
I'm losing them to you.
so you're trying to win, too. - No.
I just...
I understand how you feel.
and the only way we're gonna get through this is if we stop worrying about...
who wins.
I'm sorry to burden you with this, But I just couldn't keep it to myself anymore.
why not? Why did you have to tell me?
repression is, like, your thing.
okay, let's--let's say someone knows.
they're not asking us for money.
they're not trying to blackmail us.
I say until they tell us what they want, we just act like everything's normal.
except I'm drinking a lot more.
you don't think we should tell the others?
well, we can't tell susan. She's already flipping out.
you're right. And we shouldn't tell lynette, Given what's going on in her marriage.
or carlos, given what's going on in mine.
so you don't think we should do anything?
well, there is one thing I've been telling you you need to do.
get rid of Chuck!
you're right. I should, but, um-- - But what?
this is gonna sound strange.
he makes me feel safe.
safe? Yeah, I do think that's strange,
especially now that some lunatic knows.
but you've got to end this, and you've got to end it now.
now isn't that funny?
I was just thinking to myself, "how am I gonna wash my back in the shower?
and then you walk in.
serendipity, huh?
sorry. I'm gonna pass.
okay.
is, um...something on your mind?
it can wait.
Bree... - Go ahead. Take your shower.
Hello?
I have a collect call From fairview correctional institution.
will you accept the charges? - Yes.
Bree, it's Paul Young.
I've been thinking about what you asked me
you know, who might have known about Mary Alice's note.
yeah?
when I confessed to the murder of Martha Huber,
I mentioned the letter to the police.
well, do you remember who these policemen were?
the main detective was a tall guy with a short name like, uh, Pence or Vince.
was it Vance? Chuck Vance?
Yes, that's it.
I have to go.
okay. I know that was the shortest shower I've ever taken, but I...
I really didn't like the look on your face before.
be honest with me, Bree.
are you about to break up with me?
of course not.
in fact, let's get you back in that shower.
Yes, in the divided world of the suburbs, everyone is looking for some way to make a connection.
some seek to connect by focusing on a greater good...
some by revealing a common history...
some by sharing a pain no one else can heal.
then there are those who once sought to make a connection...
that they now want desperately to escape.
george paid for what he did to your father.
Bree confessed...
did you give Zach money to go to Utah?
Susan betrayed mike... what kind of friend is he?
the real good kind. Andrew pushed the boundaries...
Zach's come home. Is there anything I can do?
paul put his foot down... you can leave us alone.
so when do I tell people you'll be back?
couple, maybe three days.
and a stranger finally caught up with Caleb.
kisses are such simple things, we hardly notice them.
but if we paid more attention, we'd see that each kiss conveys a meaning all its own.
for example, some can say, "I'm so happy to see you.
or, "I didn't realize you'd be here.
or, "honey, it's time to stop drinking.
the trick is in knowing how to tell the difference.
so I finally said, if I'm head cheerleader, then nobody wears panties.
Yeah!
I just want you to know as a former member of my high school marching band, I would've appreciated that.
wait a second, you were a band geek? Oh, I don't believe it.
what do you play? He played the tuba. I have pictures.
the tuba, huh?
Yeah, go ahead, come on, come on, get your licks in, go ahead.
no, no, not at all. As a matter of fact, all of my secret crushes were on the band geeks.
come on, I know you cheerleader types.
you wouldn't have said "boo" to guys like me.
no, you were more interested in the guys like... like this.
now, I take it you didn't play the tuba.
no, I didn't.
all I know is, I was a lonely, insecure tuba player.
girls like Gabrielle would just rip my heart out.
Aw.
I didn't even had my first kiss until I was 18.
18? Pathetic, i know.
poor baby. I would've kissed you.
no, you wouldn't have. Yes, i would have.
no, you wouldn't have. And it's okay, Gaby.
those scars healed long time ago.
Oh, for god sakes, come here.
now on behalf of all the cheerleaders in the world, forgive us.
Oh, yeah! Whoo!
Yes, kisses mean different things to different people.
ultimately, the meaning depends on the one who does the kissing...
wowie.
Cheers.
and the who sees it happen.
after every party comes the time for cleaning.
attend to the champagne that was spilled, the knickknacks that got broken, the food that went uneaten.
Oh, here, let me take that.
and whatever other messes need cleaning up.
so, uh, gaby...
you know that thing you and tom did tonight?
the... the kiss?
was that hysterical? The look on tom's face!
Yeah.
I know this sounds silly, but...
it kind of bugged me.
you're not serious.
Yeah, I am.
I don't... I don't want to make a big deal out of it, but, uh, could you maybe not do that again?
okay.
Thanks.
okay.
Hey, what happened to the Applewhites?
I thought you were gonna invite them.
I did. Betty never r. s.v. p.'d.
what do you guys think about the applewhites?
I like 'em, very nice. Very...
interesting.
right, interesting.
hmm, they weird me out, too.
well, that's not what we're saying.
not exactly, anyway.
you know, we were just having fun, entertaining the crowd.
Oh, sure, but...
but maybe next time you could try juggling instead.
what's going on? Nothing.
Really? I sense a little tension.
no, no tension.
what?
you make it sound like...
I was making a pass at your husband.
and that's just a little bit insulting.
I just said it bugger me.
is this about that kiss? What kiss?
Oh, you were in the living room.
Gaby planted a big, wet kiss on tom... as a joke.
it was hilarious.
you see?
Yeah, but to be fair to Lynette, you are an ex-model.
and surely it must have dawned on you that some women might prefer it if you didn't kiss their husbands. That's all I'm saying.
Oh, you guys, we're all friends.
this isn't something to get worked up over.
I'm not worked up.
me neither.
Hey, everyone, did you see what Kathy Lewis was wearing tonight?
and whoever told her that she could get away with those vertical stripes should be shot.
Oh. Bye, sweetie.
uh...
Oh!
Zach is back!
Yeah, yeah, I know.
you do?
Yeah, he's been back for a couple of days now.
well, that's great, isn't it? Yeah.
I thought you'd be happy about it.
I thought that's what you wanted.
I was hoping that I'd slowly establish a relationsh with Zach and then when we were comfortable, I'd tell him I was his real dad. But now Paul's back.
and he doesn't want you anywhere near him.
he's threatened to tell the police everything that happened in the desert...
that I held a gun to his head.
well, it's your word against his.
but he doesn't have a record, and I do.
you know, despite what I did...
sending Zach away, I want you two to connect. I hope you know that.
I do.
and on the bright side, I don't have to wonder where he is anymore.
it says that you can do a report on anything from the suggested reading list, which includes "the old man and the sea," "the pearl,
much ado about nothing.
hmm. That sounds good. What do you like?
I don't care.
let's start with "the pearl.
it's got a sad ending, but it's good. We'll start with that.
you know, it's not gonna be so bad.
I think you're really gonna like being homeschooled.
okay, I know this isn't what you want.
but I need to keep you close to me just for a while.
there are people in this neighborhood who aren't thrilled that we're back.
people I don't trust.
people like... Mike Delfino?
why would you say that?
when you disappeared, Mrs. Tillman said that Mike took you somewhere to kill you.
that's ridiculous. Why would Mike wanna kill me?
because you murdered Mrs. Huber?
what did you say?
well, Mrs. Tillman said that you murdered Mrs. Huber because she was blackmailing mom.
and you believed her?
no, not exactly.
I mean, why? Should I?
Zach, you know me better than anyone.
do you honestly believe that I am capable of murder?
no.
all right, then.
of course...
I didn't think mom was capable of suicide, either.
on second thought, why don't we start with "much ado about nothing"?
I think we could use a few laughs around here.
Yeah, man...
Yeah, he sure is. I just...
probably. Yeah.
Hey.
get over here.
now.
somebody's angry.
did one of your souffl\s fall?
I saw what you did with your friend.
Oh, and you didn't turn into a pillar of salt. Good for you.
this is not a joke, Andrew.
what if the neighbors had seen you?
well, I'd hope they'd think that I'd landed a hottie.
I may not be able to control what you do outside of this home, but while you are under this roof, you will not mock my values.
if you so much as smile at that boy, so help me, I will ship you off to camp Hennessey and I will not pick you up again until you are 18.
do I make myself clear?
aren't you forgetting something?
I know you like to knock a few back before bedtime.
go on, take it. It's okay.
we both know that of the two of us, I'm the one that doesn't judge.
please. I don't wanna stay down here.
I-I know.
I'm sorry.
Matthew, I think we might have termites.
you need to take a look at those steps before one of us breaks our neck.
what's the matter? Is your brother okay?
no, he's not. He hates it down here.
he wants to be with us. You're being cruel.
if you are so concerned about him, you should spend less time on your computer and more time down here keing him company.
we're bringing him up, but not until I am sure that it's safe.
Hey, you!
yeah?
what's the deal?
you've been parked on our street for two hours.
Oh, I'm doing a property appraisal.
some neighbors of yours are thinking about moving.
the Applewhites?
I'm not really allowed to say.
I sold them that house. You know, this is my turf!
who do you work for?
Geist realty?
Ah, westside properties.
Yeah, well, whoever it is, you go back and you tell your bosses that nobody, and I mean, nobody, buys or sells properties in this neighborhood without going through Edie Britt, you got that?
look, lady, I just go where I'm told.
you look, you cross me, and I will be your worst nightmare.
I'm a dangerous woman. You don't wanna mess with me.
you got it.
ms. Mayer?
Zach. May I talk to you?
I have some things that I need to say.
okay.
I-I know that I did a lot of bad stuff...
stuff that I'm not gonna be able to take back.
ms. Mayer, I'm... I'm really sorry.
but when I was living on the streets, you know, I had a lot of time to... to just sit and think to myself and clear my head and...
I've grown up, you know? I don't want you to worry.
I'm not gonna be bothering you anymore.
either of you.
well, thanks. We appreciate that.
please don't tell my dad that I talked to you.
he's just... he's been really...intense lately.
well, what do you think?
he seems different.
I believe him.
Yeah, I can't believe I'm about to say this, but I feel sorry for him.
it's like he's so fragile.
I know, and he's locked in that house with Mr. Creepy 24/7.
did you know that he's homeschoolinzach now?
I think he should spend some time with decent role model, don't you?
Hi!
Hey, you're out early.
Oh, I just wanted to pick up some fresh croissants for breakfast.
Oh, cool. Listen, I just wanted you to know I appreciated you backing me up last night, you know, with the kiss thing.
to be honest, I don't think I would've liked it, either.
Yeah, but I probably should've just gone with it.
Gaby was just being Gaby... having fun.
no, I wouldn't be so hard on yourself, given her history.
what do you mean?
you know, the affair. Gaby had an affair?
you didn't know? No!
I thought everybody knew.
Oh, I feel awful.
Oh, Ida Greenberg's behind you.
Ida, just a second.
I am stunned. Who was it with?
I shouldn't have said anything.
Bree, come on, just tell me.
her gardener.
Oh, you're kidding!
no, no, not him. Helen Rowland's son, John.
the teenager?
Ida, wait, or go around!
does gaby know that you know?
absolutely not.
I think the best thing to do is just smile and pretend you don't know anything.
Hi.
Oh, sorry!
are you okay?
Yeah.
I'm all right. What's up?
we have an idea how to bring you and Zach together.
bowling. Bowling?
Yeah, I e-mailed zach, and he said he's gonna meet us there. You can come, too.
does Paul know about this?
no, and we're not planning on telling him.
I don't think that's a good idea, susan.
Mike, I'm part of the reason things got so screwed up.
I just want a chance to make things right.
and you're okay with this... being around Zach?
we talked to him. He's changed.
well, I guess we're going bowling.
wake up, sleepyhead.
I brought fresh croissants for breakfast!
uh, hi, Mrs. Van de kamp.
I'm Justin, Andrew's lab partner...
from school.
dude, wake up.
I want you downstair... now.
okay, first of all, I want you to march back upstairs and tell your friend he is no longer welcome in this house.
but we haven't even had breakfast yet! I am serious, andrew.
you tell him to get out of here this second or I will call the police, and I will have him removed! Well, go ahead, call 'em.
Oh, you think I won't?
I just wonder how they'll react when they find out that you killed george williams.
I didn't kill george.
well, no, but you sat there and let him die, which, I'm no lawyer, but I'm pretty sure there's a crime in there somewhere.
don't get me wrong. I mean, I'm glad you did it.
but when the cops get here, my official position will be, uh, "oh, my god, I'm being raised by a homicidal maniac.
I think I might even throw in a few tears.
you would actually let the police arrest your own mother?
come on, penny. Let's get those groceries in there.
come on. Here we go. Get this one...
and this one, and daddy... uh-oh! Whoa!
Oh!
Oh, it looks like you could use a hand.
bless you. Here, Gaby.
and penny!
Oh, come here, you sweet little thing.
well, thank you so much, Gaby. Come on in.
Oh, god, um, Tom?
yeah?
uh, I think she got sick.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
usually, she only throws up on immediate family.
I'm honored.
Oh, um, do you mind just putting her in the playpen there?
hello.
guess what? Ed loved the pitch. I got off early!
you're kidding! That's great!
Hey, I'm right by the supermarket.
you want me to pick up anything? Um, actually, i just came from there.
except, you know what? I forgot bread.
would you mind? Not at all.
Tom, I need to wipe up. Do you have a towel?
sure, hold on.
Hey!
Hey, honey. Hey, did you get the bread?
, yeah, they were out.
of bread?
Yeah. Hey, gaby. A surprise seeing you here.
well, I saw that Tom was overwhelmed, so I thought I'd give him a hand.
Really? Wow, that was nice of you.
is there a problem?
no.
Really? Because I sense that you're annoyed you found me here when you weren't home. Am I wrong?
okay. Yeah.
so exact what are you doing here helping out?
damn it, lynette, if this has to do with that stupid kiss the other night, I'm gonna lose it!
whoa, whoa, whoa, what's going on?
Lynette thinks I was hitting on you at Bree's party.
(laughing that's ridiculous.
I never said that. What I said was that it made me uncomfortable when you kissed him.
it's obviously an issue for me.
and yet, here you are, alone in my kitchen with my husband.
so you tell me, are you hitting on him? Lynette.
I can't believe you. I have done nothing to deserve this kind of mistrust.
well, that's not entirely true.
what does that mean?
come on, gaby. It's a small town. People talk.
okay, what's going on here?
I'll tell you.
your wife doesn't trust me around you because I had an affair with my teenage gardener.
Oh.
so I know Susan Mayer would never tell.
it must've been Helen Rowland.
she probably blabbed to all the girls at the salon.
and Ida Greenberg goes to that salon.
so if Ida knows, the whole town knows.
and we're just gonna have to move. That's all there is to it.
Carlos, can you stop putting for two seconds and show me some support?
what do you expect me to do? You brought this on yourself.
it was a harmless little kiss!
why is everybody making a big deal about this?
because you had an affair with an underage gardener.
people don't think you're harmless.
they see you as a predator.
you're enjoying this, aren't you?
punishing me, dangling the affair over my head?
well, I won't tolerate it.
Really?
so just what are you gonna do about it?
I'm gonna let you even the score.
Carlos, go have an affair. What?
I had my little indiscretion.
I know you want to. I do not.
sure you do. Knock yourself out.
call up an old college flame. Rent a call girl.
fly to Africa and nail that little nun you've been drooling over.
I don't care!
you're crazy.
no, I'm pragmatic.
because once you finish your fling, we'll be equals again.
and then you won't be able to judge me.
and we can go back to being a boring, average married couple.
Oh, ju do me a favor. Don't bring back any diseases.
are you sure you're not overreacting to this whole Gabrielle thing?
maybe.
Yes.
but Gaby doesn't think she did anything wrong.
that's not right, either.
I guess.
you're an attractive man.
there is a primal need for a woman to protect what is hers.
my initial impulse was justified.
so you really think she's into me?
I don't know.
because you're right. I am an attractive man.
you know what? I've never told you this, but sometimes when I bend down to pick up the morning paper, I catch Bree Van de Kamp checking me out.
you're kidding.
no, scout's honor. I've always exuded a certain sexual magnetism, and as I get older, I think it's only becoming more intense.
are you drunk?
Oh, I'm a hot guy living in a neighborhood filled with nothing but lonely ladies.
Oh.
they can't help themselves. I'm like... catnip.
come here.
what was that for?
thank you. Thank you for reminding me that I am the only woman in the whole world who could love an idiot like you.
I'll talk to Gaby. I'm telling you, these women want me. Oh, yeah.
they see the rippling muscles underneath this t-shirt...
good night, Tom. They cannot resist me.
shut up and go to sleep.
son of a bitch.
you gotta be kidding me.
whoa, whoa.
I'm here to help you, Caleb.
all right?
mama's gon' be mad.
don't you worry about that moms love me.
all right, let's go.
No!
okay, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have talked to you like that.
let's start over.
Aah!
let's go.
I'm warning you, pinhead, don't you make me come down there after you.
come on.
come on!
all right, you asked for.
I'm gonna beat the stupid right out of you.
this hit the spot.
I didn't do it.
Oh, dear.
well, hey there.
Hi, Karl. Oh!
Oh, um, quick question...
when someone discusses a sensitive situation with a lawyer such as yourself, when does attorney/client confidentiality kick in?
from the moment the lawyer's been hired. Why?
here's a check for $100.
that's enough for a retainer, right?
well, I guess. What's going on, Bree?
my son is trying to blackmail me.
and I want you to stop the little s. o. b.
do you think you could do that?
he has an Illinois license.
it says here his name is Munroe.
does that name mean anything to you?
no, but at least he wasn't a policeman.
poor man.
I hope he didn't suffer too much.
mom, are we looking at the same body?
what is it?
as soon as it gets dark, we get rid of that body.
Hey.
um...
I hope it's okay. Carlos let me in.
actually, I'm right in the middle of something, and I don't know when I'll be done.
I'm just here to say I am sorry, and I have been a complete idiot.
all done.
so cute. 'Cause it's beautiful!
is the coast clear?
Yes, it is. We worked it out.
no kidding. How'd you manage that one?
simple. Lynette admitted she was wrong, and I agreed.
well, 99% wrong.
Oh, whatever, close enough.
anyway, Tom's probably got dinner ready by now.
so I should get goin'.
okay.
good night. Bye! Mwah!
you know what the 1% is, right?
no, not really.
does it matter?
it kinda does.
I wanna get it clear for our friendship.
okay.
what's the 1%?
well, well...
Yes, I overreacted.
I think you can see how even though I was somewhat off base, you were a little wrong, right?
no. I kissed Tom, and it was a harmless joke.
I think if I had kissed anybody else's husband, they would've laughed and then forgot about it ten seconds later.
okay, let's test that theory.
see? I don't care.
that's... just a waste of time...
and spit.
Oh. Okay.
okay, okay, okay.
okay! Okay!
I get your point.
all righty, then, my work here is done.
go!
not bad.
Hey, there he is.
Zach, I'm glad you could make it.
Hey, Zach.
Mr. Delfino, I didn't know you were gonna be here.
Yeah, I was just bowling a few frames and ran into these guys.
I thought I might join you. Is, uh, that okay?
Yeah, I guess.
Oh!
okay, write that down... nine!
wise guy.
all right, just roll it in there nice and easy.
sorry.
it's okay. We're still close.
anyway, Julie's totally gonna choke.
just for that, I am not bringing you back a hot dog.
Zach, do you want one?
okay.
okay.
you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine, it's just...
I don't understand what you're doing.
what do you mean?
well, I don't understand why you're being so nice to me.
I mean, I pointed a gun at you guys. You should hate me.
we don't hate you, Zach.
you had an incredibly hard year.
and you shouldn't have done what you did, but we just wanna help you move on.
look, um...
when I was young, I got mixed up in some really bad stuff.
I even did some time in prison. Really?
Yeah, but when I got out, people were willing to forgive me.
everybody deserves a second chance. Thanks.
you know, I'm gonna go, uh, help Julie with the food.
so you guys just keep talking and bowling.
talk and bowl.
bowl and talk.
here, let me show you something.
see the arrows right in the middle?
just roll it straight over the one in the center. Okay.
you don't have to spin it or anything.
just right down the middle.
look at that!
good job.
hurry up!
I am hurrying up, okay?
wait, no! No! No!
what? I dropped the keys.
I don't have 'em. They're in here!
sometimes you just have to laugh.
would you mind turning off your video game?
my lawyer would like to have a little chat with you.
so even though your mother did witness George Williams' suicide, there's no affirmative duty to intervene.
therefore, no crime was committed.
even if the police find out, your mom will never see the inside of a courtroom.
well, maybe I got the story wrong.
what if she went over there to help him commit suicide?
if you wanna lie to the police, go right ahead.
but please know that I will sue you.
for what?
abuse of process.
it's when a person tries to exploit the legal system for an improper purpose... like blackmail.
you guys can't sue me. I'm just a kid.
Oh, don't worry.
I won't start garnishing your wages until you turn 18.
your mom... is she a peach or what?
if the cops don't give a damn, I'm sure your friends will.
how does a little public humiliation sound?
Bree, can I get a refill on this?
what are you doing?!
your father was a friend of mine.
and if he were around to see what a nasty little turd you've turned into, he'd knock the hell out of you.
Yeah, well, he's not here now, is he?
, he isn't, but if you don't get your act together and start treating your mother with some respect, I'll take care of you myself.
do you understand what i'm saying?
Yeah.
good.
Hey, neighbor.
Oh, hey, Carlos.
Hi.
I just wanted to thank you for patching things up with Gaby.
well, sure, no problem.
it's been really tough on her...
everybody finding out about the affair.
Yeah, I can imagine.
I don't mind telling you, it's, uh...
it's been pretty tough on us the past couple months.
Oh, well, I'm not surprised, and I really, really hope you can work it out.
Yeah, we're trying. You know...
Mm-hmm? Yeah?
Gaby had an interesting suggestion.
Oh?
she told me that I should go out and have an affair of my own.
she thinks it's the only way I'll be able to get over what she did to me and that it just might help our marriage.
why are you telling me this?
uh...
I guess I just, uh...
wanted to know if you had any thoughts on the subject?
I... don't.
I really don't.
well, if you ever do, let me know.
by the way...
Mm-hmm?
that was one hell of a kiss you gave me.
you can't fake chemistry like that.
what the hell is this?
stay away from my son!
Oh, my god!
dad!
you okay? I'm fine.
so I swerved to avoid hitting his car, and I hit this parked car instead, and that's when the trunk popped open, and when we got out, we found this dead body and...
are you worried now?
cause I am.
not yet. Just be patient. See what happens.
how'd it go?
well, I told him everything I know, which wasn't much.
so are we thinking this is paul?
well, he is our friendly neighborhood murderer.
Yeah, it seems obvious.
I don't know. I saw his face when he looked in the trunk.
and he looked just as shocked as I was.
I'm thinking it's the Applewhites.
I talked to the dead guy, and he said that he was doing an appraisal on their house.
well, I got a little cheesed, so I called every realtor in town.
nobody had even heard of him.
that doesn't mean Betty knew him.
please. Those two are fishy.
they bought that house sight unseen, and they did move in in the middle of the night.
and there were the noises. What noises?
Oh, a couple of weeks ago, um, I heard some noises coming from the basement, like a clanging.
and I asked betty about it.
she lied right to my face.
what's that about? I don't know.
now I'm worried.
Hi.
Hey.
my, uh, dad found out about us bowling.
I'm not gonna be able to do that anytime soon.
Oh. Sorry.
no, no, I'm glad that we did.
I haven't feel like part of a family in a long time.
Thanks.
I, um, I better get back inside.
the act itself never varies.
but each kiss carries with it a meaning all its own.
it can convey a husband's eternal devotion...
or a wife's enormous regret.
it can symbolize a mother's growing concern...
or a lover's growing passion.
but whatever its meaning, each kiss...
reflects a basic human need.
mommy's baby.
the need to connect to another human being.
this desire is so strong, it's always amazing when some people...don't understand it.
george paid for what he did to your father.
Bree confessed...
did you give Zach money to go to Utah?
Susan betrayed Mike...
what kind of friend is he?
the real good kind.
andrew pushed the boundaries...
Zach's come home. Is there anything I can do?
paul put his foot down...
you can leave us alone.
so when do I tell people you'll be back?
couple, maybe three days.
and a stranger finally caught up with Caleb.
kisses are such simple things, we hardly notice them.
but if we paid more attention, we'd see that each kiss conveys a meaning all its own.
for example, some can say, " I'm so happy to see you.
or, " I didn't realize you'd be here.
Bye.
or, " honey, it's time to stop drinking.
the trick is in knowing how to tell the difference.
so I finally said, if I'm head cheerleader, then nobody wears panties.
Yeah!
I just want you to know as a former member of my high school marching band, I would've appreciated that.
wait a second, you were a band geek?
Oh, I don't believe it.
what did you play?
he played the tuba. I have pictures.
the tuba, huh?
Yeah, go ahead, come on, come on, get your licks in, go ahead.
no, no, not at all. As a matter of fact, all of my secret crushes were on the band geeks.
come on, I know you cheerleader types.
you wouldn't have said " boo " to guys like me.
no, you were more interested in the guys like--like this. Now,
I take it you didn't play the tuba.
no, I didn't.
all I know is, I was a lonely, insecure tuba player.
girls like Gabrielle would just trip my heart out.
I didn't even had my first kiss until I was 18.
18? -Pathetic, I know.
poor baby. I would've kissed you.
no, you wouldn't have. Yes, I would have.
no, you wouldn't have. And it's okay, Gaby.
those scars healed a long time ago.
Oh, for god sakes, come here.
now on behalf of all the cheerleaders in the world, forgive us.
Oh, yeah! Whoo!
Yes, kisses mean different things to different people.
ultimately, the meaning depends on the one who does the kissing...
Wow.
Cheers.
and the who sees it happen.
after every party comes the time for cleaning.
we attend to the champagne that was spilled, the knickknacks that got broken, the food that went uneaten.
Oh, here, let me take that.
and whatever other messes need cleaning up.
so, uh, Gaby...
you know that thing you and Tom did tonight?
the--the kiss?
was that hysterical?
the look on Tom's face!
Yeah.
I know this sounds silly, but...
it kind of bugged me.
you're not serious.
Yeah, I am.
I don't
I don't want to make a big deal out of it, but, uh, could you maybe not do that again?
okay.
Thanks.
okay.
Hey, what happened to the Applewhites?
I thought you were gonna invite them.
I did. Betty never R.S.V.P.D.
what do you guys think about the Applewhites?
I like 'em, very nice.
very...
interesting.
right, interesting.
hmm, they weird me out, too.
well, that's not what we're saying.
not exactly, anyway.
you know, we were just having fun, entertaining the crowd.
Oh, sure, but...
but maybe next time you could try juggling instead.
what's going on?
nothing.
Really?
I sense a little tension.
no, no tension.
what?
you make it sound like...
I was making a pass at your husband.
and that's just a little bit insulting.
I just said it bugged me.
why is that a problem?
is this about that kiss?
what kiss?
Oh, you were in the living room.
Gaby planted a big, wet kiss on Tom... as a joke.
it was hilarious.
you see?
Yeah, but to be fair to Lynette, you are an ex-model.
and surely it must have dawned on you that some women might prefer it if you didn't kiss their husbands.
that's all I'm saying.
Oh, you guys, we're all friends.
this isn't something to get worked up over.
I'm not worked up.
me neither.
Hey, everyone, did you see what Kathy Lewis was wearing tonight?
and whoever told her that she could get away with those vertical stripes should be shot.
Oh.
Bye, sweetie.
Zach is back!
Yeah, yeah, I know.
you do?
Yeah, he's been back for a couple of days now.
well, that's great, isn't it?
Yeah.
I thought you'd be happy about it.
I thought that's what you wanted.
I was hoping that I'd slowly establish a relationship with Zach and then when we were comfortable,
I'd tell him I was his real dad.
but now Paul's back.
and he doesn't want you anywhere near him.
he's threatened to tell the police everything that happened in the desert
that I held a gun to his head.
well, it's your word against his.
but he doesn't have a record, and I do.
you know, despite what I did
sending Zach away,
I want you two to connect.
I hope you know that.
I do.
and on the bright side,
I don't have to wonder where he is anymore.
it says that you can do a report on anything from the suggested reading list, which includes " the old man and the sea,
the pearl,
much ado about nothing.
that sounds good. What do you like?
I don't care.
let's start with " the pearl.
it's got a sad ending, but it's good.
we'll start with that.
you know, it's not gonna be so bad.
but maybe next time you could try
okay,
I know this isn't what you want.
but I need to keep you close to me just for a while.
there are people in this neighborhood who aren't thrilled that we're back.
people I don't trust.
people like...Mike Delfino?
why would you say that?
when you disappeared, Mrs. Tillman said that Mike took you somewhere to kill you.
that's ridiculous. Why would Mike wanna kill me?
because you murdered Mrs. Huber?
what did you say?
well, Mrs. Tillman said that you murdered Mrs. Huber because she was blackmailing mom.
and you believed her?
no, not exactly.
I mean, why? Should I?
Zach, you know me
better than anyone.
do you honestly believe that I am capable of murder?
no.
all right, then.
of course...
I didn't think mom was capable of suicide, either.
on second thought, why don't we start with " much ado about nothing " ?
I think we could use a few laughs around here.
Yeah, man...
Yeah, he sure is. I just...
probably. -Yeah.
Hey.
get over here. Now.
somebody's angry.
I saw what you did with your friend.
Oh, and you didn't turn into a pillar of salt. Good for you.
this is not a joke, Andrew.
what if the neighbors had seen you?
well, I'd hope they'd think that I'd landed a hottie.
I may not be able to control what you do outside of this home, but while you are under this roof, you will not mock my values.
if you so much as smile at that boy, so help me, I will ship you off to camp Hennessey and I will not pick you up again until you are 18.
do I make myself clear?
aren't you forgetting something?
I know you like to knock a few back before bed time.
go on, take it. It's okay.
we both know that of the two of us,
I'm the one that doesn't judge.
please. I don't wanna stay down here.
I-I know.
I'm sorry, K.
I'm sorry.
Matthew, I think we might have termites.
you need to take a look at those steps before one of us breaks our neck.
what's the matter? Is your brother okay?
no, he's not. He hates it down here.
he wants to be with us. You're being cruel.
if you are so concerned about him, you should spend less time on your computer and more time down here keeping him company.
we're bringing him up, but not until I am sure that it's safe.
Hey, you!
yeah?
what's the deal?
you've been parked on our street for two hours.
Oh, I'm doing a property appraisal.
some neighbors of yours are thinking about moving.
the Applewhites?
I'm not really allowed to say.
I sold them that house. You know, this is my turf!
who do you work for?
Geist Realty?
Ah, Westside Properties.
Yeah, well, whoever it is, you go back and you tell your bosses that nobody, and I mean, nobody, buys or sells properties in this neighborhood without going through Edie Britt, you got that?
look, lady, I just go where I'm told.
you look, you cross me, and I will be your worst nightmare.
I'm a dangerous woman. You don't wanna mess with me.
you got it.
ms. Mayer?
Zach. May I talk to you?
I have some things that I need to say.
okay.
I-I know that I did a lot of bad stuff
stuff that I'm not gonna be able to take back.
ms. Mayer, I'm--I'm really sorry.
but when I was living on the streets, you know,
I had a lot of time to--to just sit and think to myself and clear my head and...
I've grown up, you know? I don't want you to worry.
I'm not gonna be bothering you anymore.
either of you.
well, thanks. We appreciate that.
please don't tell my Dad that I talked to you.
he's just--he's been really...
intense lately.
well, what do you think?
he seems different.
I believe him.
Yeah, I can't believe I'm about to say this, but I feel sorry for him.
it's like he's so fragile.
I know, and he's locked in that house with Mr. Creepy 24/7.
did you know that he's homeschooling Zach now?
I think he should spend some time with a decent role model, don't you?
Hi!
Hey, you're out early.
Oh, I just wanted to pick up some fresh croissants for breakfast.
Oh, cool. Listen, I just wanted you to know
I appreciated you backing me up last night, you know, with the kiss thing.
to be honest, I don't think I would've liked it, either.
Yeah, but I probably should've just gone with it.
Gaby was just being Gaby--having fun.
no, I wouldn't be so hard on yourself, given her history.
what do you mean?
you know, the affair.
Gaby had an affair?
you didn't know? -No!
I thought everybody knew.
Oh, I feel awful.
Oh, Ida Greenberg's behind you.
Ida, just a second.
I am stunned.
who was it with?
I shouldn't have said anything.
Bree, come on, just tell me.
her gardener.
Oh, you're kidding!
no, no, not him. Helen Rowland's son, John.
the teenager?
Ida, wait, or go around!
does Gaby know that you know?
absolutely not.
I think the best thing to do is just smile and pretend you don't know anything.
Hi.
Oh, sorry!
are you okay?
Yeah.
I'm all right.
what's up?
we have an idea how to bring you and Zach together.
bowling.
bowling? -Yeah, I e-mailed Zach, and he said he's gonna meet us there.
you can come, too.
does Paul know about this?
no, and we're not planning on telling him.
I don't think that's a good idea, Susan.
Mike, I'm part of the reason things got so screwed up.
I just want a chance to make things right.
and you're okay with this--being around Zach?
we talked to him. He's changed.
well, I guess we're going bowling.
wake up, sleepyhead.
I brought fresh croissants for breakfast!
uh, hi, Mrs. Van De Kamp.
I'm Justin, Andrew's lab partner...
from school.
dude, wake up.
I want you downstairs... now.
okay, first of all, I want you to march back upstairs and tell your friend he is no longer welcome in this house.
but we haven't even had breakfast yet!
I am serious, Andrew.
you tell him to get out of here this second or I will call the police, and I will have him removed!
well, go ahead, call 'em.
Oh, you think I won't?
I just wonder how they'll react when they find out that you killed George Williams.
I didn't kill George.
well, no, but you sat there and let him die, which, I'm no lawyer, but I'm pretty sure there's a crime in there somewhere.
don't get me wrong. I mean, I'm glad you did it.
but when the cops get here, my official position will be, uh,"oh, my god, I'm being raised by a homicidal maniac.
I think I might even throw in a few tears.
you would actually let the police arrest your own mother?
Hey, we all gotta cut the apron strings at some point.
come on, Penny. Let's get those groceries in there.
come on. Here we go. Get this one...
and this one, and Daddy--uh-oh! Whoa!
Oh!
Oh, it looks like you could use a hand.
bless you. Here, Gaby.
and Penny!
Oh, come here, you sweet little thing.
well, thank you so much, Gaby. Come on in.
Oh, god, um, Tom?
yeah?
uh, I think she got sick.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
usually, she only throws upon immediate family.
I'm honored.
Oh, um, do you mind just putting her in the playpen there?
hello.
guess what? Ed loved the pitch. I got off early!
you're kidding! That's great!
Hey, I'm right by the supermarket.
you want me to pick up anything?
um, actually, I just came from there.
except, you know what? I forgot bread.
would you mind? -Not at all.
Tom, I need to wipe up. Do you have a towel?
sure, hold on.
Hey!
Hey, honey.
Hey, did you get the bread?
Oh, yeah, they were out.
of bread?
Yeah. Hey, Gaby.
a surprise seeing you here.
well, I saw that Tom was overwhelmed, so I thought I'd give him a hand.
Really? Wow, that was nice of you.
is there a problem?
no.
Really?
because I sense that you're annoyed you found me here when you weren't home. Am I wrong?
okay. Yeah.
so exactly what are you doing here helping out?
damn it, Lynette, if this has to do with that stupid kiss the other night, I'm gonna lose it!
whoa, whoa, whoa, what's going on?
Lynette thinks I was hitting on you at Bree's party.
that's ridiculous.
I never said that.
what I said was that it made me uncomfortable when you kissed him.
it's obviously an issue for me.
and yet, here you are, alone in my kitchen with my husband.
so you tell me, are you hitting on him?
I can't believe you. I have done nothing to deserve this kind of mistrust.
well, that's not entirely true.
what does that mean?
come on, Gaby.
it's a small town. People talk.
okay, what's going on here?
I'll tell you.
your wife doesn't trust me around you because I had an affair with my teenage gardener.
Oh.
so I know Susan Mayer would never tell.
it must've been Helen Rowland.
she probably blabbed to all the girls at the salon.
and Ida Greenberg goes to that salon.
so if Ida knows, the whole town knows.
and we're just gonna have to move. That's all there is to it.
Carlos, can you stop putting for two seconds and show me some support?
what do you expect me to do? You brought this on yourself.
it was a harmless little kiss!
why is everybody making a big deal about this?
because you had an affair with an underage gardener.
people don't think you're harmless.
they see you as a predator.
you're enjoying this, aren't you?
punishing me, dangling the affair over my head?
well, I won't tolerate it.
Really?
so just what are you gonna do about it?
I'm gonna let you even the score.
Carlos, go have an affair.
what?
I had my little indiscretion.
so you go have yours. Get it out of your system.
I know you want to. -I do not.
sure you do. Knock yourself out.
call up an old college flame. Rent a call girl.
fly to Africa and nail that little nun you've been drooling over.
I don't care!
you're crazy.
no, I'm pragmatic.
because once you finish your fling, we'll be equals again.
and then you won't be able to judge me.
and we can go back to being a boring, average married couple.
Oh, just do me a favor. Don't bring back any diseases.
are you sure you're not overreacting to this whole Gabrielle thing?
maybe.
Yes.
but Gaby doesn't think she did anything wrong.
that's not right, either.
I guess.
you're an attractive man.
there is a primal need for a woman to protect what is hers.
my initial impulse was justified.
so you really think she's into me?
I don't know.
because you're right. I am an attractive man.
you know what? I've never told you this, but sometimes when I bend down to pick up the morning paper,
I catch Bree Van De Kamp checking me out.
you're kidding.
no, scout's honor.
I've always exuded a certain sexual magnetism, and as I get older,
I think it's only becoming more intense.
are you drunk?
Oh, I'm a hot guy living in a neighborhood filled with nothing but lonely ladies.
they can't help themselves. I'm like... catnip.
come here.
what was that for?
thank you. Thank you for reminding me that I am the only woman in the whole world who could love an idiot like you.
I'll talk to Gaby. -I'm telling you, -these women want me. -Oh, yeah.
they see the rippling muscles underneath this t-shirt...
good night, Tom.
they cannot resist me.
shut up and go to sleep.
Aah!
son of a bitch.
you gotta be kidding me.
whoa, whoa.
I'm here to help you, Caleb.
all right?
mama's gon' be mad.
don't you worry about that.
moms love me.
all right, let's go.
No!
okay, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have talked to you like that.
let's start over.
Aah!
let's go.
I'm warning you, pinhead, don't you make me come down there after you.
come on.
come on!
all right, you asked for it.
I'm gonna beat the stupid right out of you.
this hit the spot.
I didn't do it.
Oh, dear.
well, hey there.
Hi, Karl. Oh!
Oh, um, quick question
when someone discusses a sensitive situation with a lawyer such as yourself, when does attorney/client confidentiality kick in?
from the moment the lawyer's been hired. Why?
here's a check for $100.
that's enough for a retainer, right?
well, I guess. What's going on, Bree?
my son is trying to blackmail me.
and I want you to stop the little S.O.B.
do you think you could do that?
he has an Illinois license.
it says here his name is Munroe.
does that name mean anything to you?
no, but at least the wasn't a policeman.
poor man.
I hope he didn't suffer too much.
mom, are we looking at the same body?
what is it?
as soon as it gets dark, we get rid of that body.
Hey.
um...
I hope it's okay. Carlos let me in.
actually, I'm right in the middle of something, and I don't know when I'll be done.
I'm just here to say I am sorry, and I have been a complete idiot.
all done.
so cute.'Cause it's beautiful!
is the coast clear?
Yes, it is. We worked it out.
no kidding. How'd you manage that one?
simple. Lynette admitted she was wrong, and I agreed.
well, 99% wrong.
Oh, whatever, close enough.
anyway, Tom's probably got dinner ready by now.
so I should get goin'.
okay.
good night. Bye! Mwah!
you know what the 1% is, right?
no, not really.
does it matter?
it kinda does.
I wanna get it clear for our friendship.
okay.
what's the 1%?
well, well...
Yes, I overreacted.
I think you can see how even though I was somewhat off base, you were a little wrong, right?
no. I kissed Tom, and it was a harmless joke.
I think if I had kissed anybody else's husband, they would've laughed and then forgot about it ten seconds later.
okay, let's test that theory.
see? I don't care.
That's...just a waste of time...
and spit.
Oh. Okay.
okay, okay, okay.
okay! Okay!
I get your point.
all right, then, my work here is done.
go!
not bad.
Hey, there he is.
Zach, I'm glad you could make it.
Hey, Zach.
Mr. Delfino, I didn't know you were gonna be here.
Yeah, I was just bowling a few frames and ran into these guys.
I thought I might join you. Is, uh, that okay?
Yeah, I guess.
Oh!
okay, write that down--nine!
wise guy.
all right, just roll it in there nice and easy.
sorry.
it's okay. We're still close.
anyway, Julie's totally gonna choke.
just for that, I am not bringing you back a hot dog.
Zach, do you want one?
okay.
you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine, it's just...
I don't understand what you're doing.
what do you mean?
well, I don't understand why you're being so nice to me.
I mean, I pointed a gun at you guys. You should hate me.
we don't hate you, Zach.
you had an incredibly hard year.
and you shouldn't have done what you did, but we just wanna help you move on.
look, um...
when I was young,
I got mixed up in some really bad stuff.
I even did some time in prison.
Really? -Yeah, but when I got out, people were willing to forgive me.
everybody deserves a second chance.
Thanks.
you know, I'm gonna go, uh, help Julie with the food.
so you guys just keep talking and bowling.
talk and bowl.
bowl and talk.
here, let me show you something.
see the arrows right in the middle?
just roll it straight over the one in the center. Okay.
you don't have to spin it or anything.
just right down the middle.
look at that!
good job.
hurry up!
I am hurrying up, okay?
wait, no! No! No!
what? -I dropped the keys.
I don't have 'em. They're in here!
sometimes you just have to laugh.
would you mind turning off your video game?
my lawyer would like to have a little chat with you.
so even though your mother did witness George Williams' suicide, there's no affirmative duty to intervene.
therefore, no crime was committed.
even if the police find out, your mom will never see the inside of a courtroom.
well, maybe I got the story wrong.
what if she went over there to help him commit suicide?
if you wanna lie to the police, go right ahead.
but please know that I will sue you.
for what?
abuse of process.
it's when a person tries to exploit the legal system for an improper purpose--like blackmail.
you guys can't sue me. I'm just a kid.
Oh, don't worry.
I won't start garnishing your wages until you turn 18.
your mom--is she a peach or what?
if the cops don't give a damn, I'm sure your friends will.
how does a little public humiliation sound?
Bree, can I get a refill on this?
what are you doing?!
your father was a friend of mine.
Yeah, well, he's not here now, is he?
no, he isn't, but if you don't get your act together and start treating your mother with some respect,
I'll take care of you myself.
do you understand what I'm saying?
Yeah.
good.
Hey, neighbor.
Oh, hey, carlos.
Hi.
I just wanted to thank you for patching things up with Gaby.
well, sure, no problem.
it's been really tough on her
everybody finding out about the affair.
Yeah, I can imagine.
I don't mind telling you, it's, uh...
it's been pretty tough on us the past couple months.
Oh, well, I'm not surprised, and I really, really hope you can work it out.
Yeah, we're trying. You know...
Mm-hmm? Yeah?
Gaby had an interesting suggestion.
Oh?
she told me that I should go out and hav e an affairof my own.
she thinks it's the only way
I'll be able to get over what she did to me and that it just might help our marriage.
why are you telling me this?
uh...
I guess I just, uh...
wanted to know if you had any thoughts on the subject?
I... don't.
I really don't.
well, if you ever do, let me know.
by the way...
Mm-hmm?
that was one hell of a kiss you gave me.
you can't fake chemistry like that.
what the hell is this?
stay away from my son!
Oh, my god!
dad!
you okay? -I'm fine.
Aah!
so I squirm to avoid hitting his car and I hit parker instead and that's from the trunk top open when we got out we found this dead body are you worried now 'cause I am not yet let's be patient, see what will happens how'd go well I told them everything I know which wasn't much so we thinking this is Paul well he's our friendly neighborhood murderer,yes,it seems obvious
I don't know
I saw his face when he looked into the trunk and he looked just as shocked as I was
I'm thinking it was the Applewhites
I talked to the dead guy
he said he was doing appraisal on their house
I got a little cheesed so I called all the realtors in town nobody had even heard of him that doesn't mean Betty knew him please those two were fishy they bought that house sight unseen and they did move in the middle of the night and there were noises what noises a couple weeks ago
I heard some noises coming from the basement like cleaning
I asked Betty about it she lied right to my face what's that about
I don't know now I am worried. Hi, hi, well, my dad found out about us bowling
I cannot be able to do that anytime soon oh, sorry no no I'm glad we did
I haven't felt like a part of a family in a long time, thanks
sounds to me as if someone's let go of his rage.
maybe I have. Well, I haven't.
Felicia took matters into her own hands.
you want me to call off the wedding I'll do it.
I'll do whatever you want. Karl put the ball in Susan's court...
while Andrew tried to take Bree to court...there's a father. He's a kid!
Gabrielle and Carlos took the baby... the papers aren't valid anymore.
do you really wanna leave this beautiful little girl with that white trash freak show?
and ran with it.
Louispate believed in the power of shame.
as a teacher, she had found that the best way to control unruly students was to instill a strong sense of shame in their parents.
I left Trisha alone with the school hamster for only five minutes.
in this box is all that's left of patches.
for show and tell, Timmy decided to bring in something from your husband's collection of Nazi memorabilia.
Billy's been threatening to beat up the other kids for their milk money.
we found the proceeds in his cubby.
of course, Mrs. Pate also knew when it came to unruly children, some parents had more reason to be ashamed...than others.
so, um... your message said that Parker had been involved in some sort of serious incident.
what... what kind of incident?
yesterday afternoon, Parker offered a cookie to Cindy Lou Peeples if she would show him her vagina.
what kind of cookie?
what does that matter?
Oh, it doesn't.
I'm just stalling because I am completely mortified.
the kids were in a broom closet. Our janitor walked in on them just as Cindy was lifting up her pinafore. Oh, my goodness.
I'm sure you've noticed how obsessive Parker can be.
a certain subject will catch his interest, and that's all he'll talk about for weeks and weeks.
Oh, right. That happened with dinosaurs.
Oh, yes, we all remember his dinosaur phase.
more fondly now than ever.
Mm-hmm, so you think that now he's obsessed with what's underneath the pinafore. Yes.
look, I think he's just developed a normal curiosity about the human body.
you need to talk to him.
remind him what's appropriate and what isn't.
of course. I will talk to him.
I'll talk to him till I'm blue in the face.
I promise. Take care.
Yes, Louisa Pate believed in the power of shame.
she always believed, when someone has that power...
so, Mrs. Peeples, you'll never guess what your daughter is willing to do for a gingersnap.
it's a shame not to use it.
it had been six weeks since Andrew Van De Kamp had declared war on his mother Bree.
the final battle was about to be waged at the Fairview county courthouse.
Bree knew it was about to get bloody.
what she didn't know was the Calvary was on its way whether she wanted them there or not.
Oh, thank god I found you. This place is a maze.
what are you doing here?
well, your father and I got a call last night from Danielle, and she said that Andrew was taking you to court.
I mean, to say that we were shocked would be an understatement.
Hello, I'm Eleanor Mason, Bree's stepmother.
you're the lawyer? We should talk.
uh, no, I'm not her lawyer.
good. The hair had me worried.
Peter is mom's sponsor from A.A.
Oh, sweetie!
since when are you in A.A?
it's a recent development. Where's dad?
in chambers with the judge.
What?! Why?
everything is fine.
the judge agreed to a postponement.
Oh, thank God!
luckily, he remembered me. I spoke once at his law school.
pardon me, sir, I'm your daughter's lawyer.
just so you know, we've been waiting for this hearing for weeks, son, I've been an attorney for 45 years.
you and I both know how these cases can turn into public spectacles.
our family is perfectly capable of handling this in house.
dad, you don't understand. This has gotten really ugly.
that's why we're here.
we're gonna put this family back together.
whatever it takes.
and that's when Mr. And Mrs. Solis, fearing for the welfare of this helpless child, fled the hospital.
you mean, they kidnapped her.
well, technically, that's true, but given the situation that led up to the rescue kidnapping.
your Honor, yes, in retrospect, the plan was a little bit rash, not entirely well thought out.
idiotic.
can we object to that? Shh!
but the child is safe, Your Honor.
and all we ask the court is to allow baby Lily a lifetime of the care and love she has been receiving from the Solises.
as much as your story tugs at my heart, there is the issue of parental rights.
what does the state have to say about this?
we have located the biological father...Mr. Dale Helm.
unfortunately, uh, circumstances require that he be out of town.
he's in Fort Lauderdale today.
on business?
spring break, actually.
Mr. Helm is a high school student.
charming. In between keg stands, did the father happen to mention that says this "blows his mind" and he's extremely "bummed out."
all right...
Mr. And Mrs. Solis, since you actually want Lily, it seems you're the lesser of two evils.
I'm granting you temporary custody until we can get a straight answer from the birth father.
thank you, uh, Your Honor.
in the meantime, try not to steal any more babies.
Oh, we just needed the one.
sweetie?
um, could you put the crayons down for a second?
we need to talk.
so I spoke to your teacher today, and she told me about the cookie deal you made with Cindy Lou.
Oh. Are you mad?
no, not exactly. I'm just...I'm trying to understand why you did that.
Tommy Keenan told me babies come from down there.
it doesn't sound right to me.
Well...actually, he's kinda right. He's got the concept down.
that's weird. How's a baby get in there?
daddy will be home from his business trip in a few days.
why don't you wait for him?
okay. Okay.
or I can ask Tommy' s brother.
he's 14, and he knows everything.
and then the mommy and the daddy, because they love each other so much, they hug.
real tight.
and, uh, a seed is magically implanted.
and nine months later...a baby is born. Here.
what kind of seed?
Oh, that's not important.
I don't believe you.
Parker, I'm your mother. Mothers don't lie to their sons.
now go wash your hands or Santa' s not gonna bring you anything for Christmas.
I just saw Edie drive off. How long is she gonna be gone?
I don't know. She just went to show a house.
move.
what's the problem?
you mauled me in Edie's bed last night.
I think that deserves a conversation.
well, what's there to talk about? I'm just a fool in love.
Oh, no! You don't mean that.
Yes, I do. Look, I realize my timing's a little off.
a little?
okay... when are you gonna tell Edie? Tell her what?
that the wedding's off. Is it?
well, isn't it? It's up to you.
are... are you saying that you're gonna go through with this wedding unless I tell you not to?
just give me a commitment, Susie and I'll put a bullet in Edie. This is insane!
come on.
all this can be yours again.
just say the word... and I let go.
Oh, no! No, don't you dare!
you know you want me to. Just say it, Susie.
You're...sick!
Zach, I'm going to the drugstore.
I'll be back in 20 minutes.
Oh!
I was making cookies, and I heard the most sickening thud.
are you okay?
There's...shortening on my doorstep.
Shortening?
that's the last thing you'd want on your front porch.
it's meant for baking.
it was my grandmother's name.
so how you holding up? You must be exhausted.
you know, I'm a little tired, but it's not too bad. Oh, wait a couple months.
she'll start sleeping through the night.
Oh, honey, please. Do I look like a masochist?
firs thing tomorrow, I'm hiring a nanny and a night nurse.
no, we're not.
my husband, the comedian.
I'm serious. I don't want some stranger raising our baby.
well, you guys are busy. We should go.
no, it's okay. I'll win this battle later.
we are not gonna be some Yuppie couple
Yeah. Okay, bye.
good luck.
put down the burrito.
what is all this crap about me not getting help?
look, a brand-new baby needs to bond with its mother. The church knows it, science knows it, nature knows it.
we have the money. What is wrong with getting a little help?
then I'll be able to relax once in a while, and I'll be able to be a better mother.
do what my mam did... make sacrifices.
my mam worked her fingers to the bone for me.
and that's what put her in an early grave!
well, that and the hit-and-run thing.
look, I don't know why you want to be emancipated, and I don't know what you've been doing to drive him crazy.
bottom line... it's over.
it's now time for you two to kiss and make up.
and just how are we supposed to do that?
here's a thought...just look each other in the eye and say, "I forgive you."
it's actually a technique invent
I saw him on TV.
he says, if you verbalize forgiveness, I did it with our cleaning lady.
um, I'm sorry, dad, but I think my relationship with Andrew is just a bit more complicated than...
would it kill you to at least try?
I'll do it... for you, grandpa.
that's my boy. Bree?
fine!
Yes, um... so, um, who goes first?
either or. Doesn't matter.
mom, I forgive you.
Andrew, I forgive you.
that wasn't so hard, was it?
now don't expect to feel differently right away.
it takes a while. It took me a week to forgive Esperanza.
but now she's like family again. Family who stole from us.
how'd
um...
well, grandpa, I'm... I'm still gonna need my trust fund.
you see, l-I can't live in a place where I... I don't feel safe.
what are you talking about?
well, could you live with a woman who hits you?
Bree! I slapped him once, and he deserved it.
well, I just asked her to stop drinking.
you were drinking?
she's in A.A. Her sponsor has long hair.
Andrew, I find your concern ironic, given how tanked you were when you ran or our neighbor's mother with your car.
is she okay? She's dead!
mom watched as her boyfriend committed suicide.
and he was the same guy who killed dad!
andrew falsely accused me of molestation in a mall!
you know, the technique works best if you don't talk right away.
okay, let's go. I don't wanna be late for the movie.
Oh, those are pretty. Who sent those?
what?
say the word and I'm yours. Love, Karl.
mom, I knew this would happen when you started hanging around together, all of your old feelings resurfacing.
no, his feelings.
he's the one with the feelings, not me.
Uh-huh.
okay, don't "uh-huh" me. You're not old enough to do that.
Oh, no? Well, how do you like this.
I'm not gonna go to the movies with you. You're gonna make me go by myself?
well, you could always ask dad to go.
in fact, if you love him so much, why don't you marry him?
Oh, wait, you already did. Twice.
Oh, you know what?
I think we're gonna need some napkins with this.
Oh, okay, I'll go back. Thanks.
my ex-boyfriend's here. If he sees me alone, I'll die.
I'm begging you, please, act like you know me.
Susan? Hey!
Mike, hi! What a surprise.
how are you? Good.
Oh! God, l... I'm being so rude.
um, mike, l-I want you to meet...
nice to meet you, Mike.
wow, I can't believe I'm finally seeing the man himself in the flesh.
so... how' d you two meet?
Oh, god, I've been her dentist for years.
but last week, I was looking in her mouth and decided to stick my tongue in it.
I'll see you, Susan.
thank you so much for helping me out.
Hey, I'm great in a crisis.
well, I definitely picked the right person to sit next to.
actually, is this seat taken?
no.
okay, you can share my popcorn.
um, Susan,this is Becky.
I'll probably be sharing her popcorn.
I'll just wait till the lights go out, and then I'll...
while I get this going, can you bring out the buns?
uh, yeah.
what the hell? You all right?
this isn't lighter fluid. It's gasoline.
what?
How' d that get in there?
how do you think?
something smells good over there.
well, I don't understand. Is she trying to kill you?
no, she's trying to piss me off.
Why?
I'm not sure yet, but I do know I'm not gonna play along.
we got plenty of burgers if you want to pop over.
and bring your appetite.
Gaby, the baby.
no, I got up twice already. It's your turn.
Gaby, I have several job interviews tomorrow.
I need my sleep.
what about my sleep?
you sleep when the baby sleeps.
every 40 minutes?
when am I supposed to have a life?
what are you whining about?
you know, Xiao-mei does all the housework around here.
all you have to do is take care of the baby.
fine, fine, fine!
xiao-mei.
psst, wake up.
Mrs. Solis?
something wrong?
the baby won't stop crying, and I haven't slept for two days.
will you please take Lily for a while? Uh...
Oh, come on. I won't make you do windows tomorrow.
okay. What do I do?
well, she's a baby. You hold her.
you bounce her and, I don't know, maybe sing a little something.
Oh, and Xiao-mei, Mr. Solis does not need to know about this, okay? Okay.
okay.
Yeah, honey, can you take that downstairs?
thank you.
Eleanor, I thought you'd gone to bed.
Oh, no, not yet. I had to do my hair now.
there's never enough time in the morning.
uh, sit.
there's something I have to discuss with you.
your father and I have decided to take Andrew back to Rhode Island with us.
Really?
and whose idea was that?
Andrew's.
but Henry and I feel it's the right thing to do.
absolutely not.
if we leave him here, the two of you will wind up in court, and I'm not going to all that.
do you really think that I am enjoy airing my dirty laundry in public?
this whole situation is mortifying.
I've always admired that about you.
when you were a kid, you used to make these peanut butter cookies that were god-awful.
but you kept baking them, and you kept forcing everyone to eat them.
you were so determined to get them right.
my mother didn't think they were awful.
when I made those same cookies for her, she loved them.
well, some people praise children even when they don't deserve it.
Oh, but not you.
with you, I had to work for every kind word I ever got.
well, you always resented me because of my high standards.
no.
I resented you because those were kick-ass peanut butter cookies.
we're taking Andrew.
Eleanor, please...
he hates you, Bree.
your own son.
you know, part of being an adult is admitting that you've failed, and then moving on with grace.
do you really think that I am a failure as a parent?
well, I'd love to lie and say something supportive, but as you pointed out, that was more your mother's thing.
Xiao-mei?
so sorry. I just take break.
Oh, no, Xiao-mei, that's okay. That's okay.
I know you were up all night with the baby, and I really appreciate it.
you know, I'm very grateful for everything you've been doing for Lily.
so to thank you, I bought you a gift certificate to my spa.
and you can take a whole day off and just really pamper yourself.
Really? Mm-hmm.
thank you!
Oh, thank you!
Oh, you're welcome.
all right, Lily needs to be bathed and put to bed.
I don't wanna miss my yoga class. Hi.
Hi, pretty girl. Oh, yes, mommy has to go.
mommy has to go, so she can stay pretty and thin and you can be proud of her.
motherhood is such a blessing.
I hope you get to experience it one day.
because it's not a big deal!
it's not a big deal? Okay!
it's not that far away. Right. Oh, it's not that far away?
dude, it... whatever, okay?
you didn't even care to tell me before? Bye.
Justin, what happened?
andrew just told me he's moving in with his grandparents.
they live so far away, I'm never gonna see him anymore.
I'm so sorry. I know that you're good friends.
we're more than friends, Mrs. Van De Kamp.
I love him.
Oh.
Why?
Why?
Yes. I'd be curious to know just what it is you see in him.
well, when my parents first heard I was gay, they kicked me out.
they said I had debased the entire family and that they couldn't love me anymore until I changed.
but Andrew... he said that I should be ashamed of them, 'cause they were too stupid to know how great I was.
that's the thing about Andrew.
he doesn't take crap from anyone.
how can you not love someone like that?
you know, it never ceases to amaze me how people can turn their backs on their own family.
I mean... but it happens every day, doesn't it?
I guess.
you know, Justin, if you would be willing to help, I'm pretty sure that I could find a way to keep Andrew from moving.
what do you say?
I'm home.
Oh, hi.
Hey, Mrs. Mccluskey.
so how did everything go?
fine. Penny fussed a bit.
I think her molars are coming in. Oh.
and the twins fought over the remote.
there's nothing new there. No.
here's the big news.
Parker offered me a Fudgsicle if I would show him my vagina.
Oh, good God, Lynette, relax. I didn't do it.
I just got this out of the freezer a second ago.
uh, yeah. Of course. No, sorry.
apparently, Parker wanted to put a sunflower seed inside me and see if a baby would grow. Where do kids get this stuff?
Oh... that was me.
he was asking about the birds and the bees, and I fudged a few of the details.
well, he's only 7 years old.
I don't think he needs to know everything yet.
I don't wanna rob him of his innocence.
well, now, that's where you're wrong.
you get 'em when they're young.
give them all the gory details.
and then when they're good and disgusted, you shame 'em.
excuse me?
you tell them sex is dirty and wrong and he shouldn't talk about it, and if he does, he's going straight to hell.
that is ridiculous.
spoken like a true liberal idiot.
no, I'm not gonna shame my son.
mm, I'm telling you, it works.
it keeps people in their place, it keeps parents from being humiliated, and it keeps me from having to spend the afternoon talking about my woo-woo.
in your haste to duck out before the credits rolled, you...
Oh, my God! Oh, thank you so much.
I stuck a card in there, just in case you ever wanted to purposely sit next to me at a movie, so...
Orson, I'm flattered. Uh, really.
you... you don't wanna date me.
I mean, my love life is just so complicated right now.
well... no, I won't bore you with the details.
so the ex-boyfriend has no idea you're secretly married to the ex-husband, who still loves you, but unless you give him a reason not to, is gonna marry the neighborhood slut?
did I call Edie a slut? Mm-hmm.
well, that's overstating it. Edie's not a slut.
she's just popular with indiscriminate men.
anyway, yes, those are the relevant players.
okay. Now I'm absolutely horrified that I'm about to say what I'm about to say, but there's nobody else I can talk to who won't judge me.
and since you're a complete stranger, I'll probably never see you again unless I randomly run into you on the street, in which case, you'll ignore me 'cause you know how crazy I am.
so here goes...I'm having feelings for Karl again.
does that make me a terrible person?
you want my unvarnished opinion?
lay it on me.
it doesn't make you a terrible person, but it does make you a...well... a sucker.
this Karl's a coward.
he wants you to be the heavy and take all the responsibility.
if you're having feelings for a guy like that, I say run far, far away.
he lives three houses down.
hmm. Well, good luck to you, then.
but like I said, if you're interested in a tooth whitening, my card's still in your wallet.
Xiao-mei?
Xiao-mei?
I'm late to meet Mrs. Van De Kamp.
I'll be back in a little while.
Bree, I'm so sorry I'm late.
Oh, honey, it's all right.
I mean, with the new baby at home, I'm surprised you made it at all.
Ooh, I'll have a drink. Anything with an umbrella.
so tell me, how are you doing?
I mean, your entire world must be turned upside down.
you must be exhausted.
you know, it's been challenging, but l soldier on.
so what about you? You look so rested.
I just got a massage at Misty Spring.
things have been a little tense at home, and I needed an hour to relax.
good for you. I love that spa.
Mm. Um, oh, by the way, while I was there, I saw your, uh, your housekeeper.
Xiao-mei?
Oh, no, you must be mistaken.
I just left her. She's at home working.
are you sure? I was talking to her in the steam room for about 20 minutes. What?
Yeah, apparently you gave her a gift certificate.
Lily, mommy's coming!
Oh, thank God! Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.
I'm never gonna leave you again. Oh!
Yes. Yes.
I'm home!
my interview got canceled.
Oh, that's my little girl.
your chakra lining up nice for mommy?
that's my girl.
Hey, let me take her off your chest so you can do your yoga.
No! No, no, no. We're doing just fine.
aren't we, Lily?
Bridezilla's got me auditioning wedding bands, and I'm clueless about Edie's taste in music.
what do you think of these guys?
that's why you brought me down here? Mm-hmm.
Karl, you made it sound like it was an emergency.
it is! I need to have somebody to dance with so I can see if these guys have the power to help me get my groove on.
Oh, that's right.
you like it laid-back and romantic, don't you?
guys, can we play something mellow?
no, don't bother, 'cause I'm going.
Two...that was not a coincidence.
this was playing the night we first kissed.
I remember. I also remember that you are planning on marrying someone else.
not if you don't want me to.
come on, Susie.
I can see you still have feelings for me, and I know I have never stopped loving you.
okay, you want the truth?
I don't know how I feel about you, but I keep looking at you, trying to see if you've changed, if you've grown up.
you know what I see?
I see the same weak coward that walked out on me three years ago.
of course I've changed.
I don't think so.
so I think you should probably stay with Edie.
and the band is good. You should hire 'em.
what the hell?
for god's sake, what the hell are you doing in there?!
this is my house. What are you doing?
we're tenting for termites. We got a work order.
signed by who?
I've never been so embarrassed in my whole life.
they're supposed to be tenting my house.
I must've written the address down wrong.
you've taken it too far this time.
these little mind games are gonna stop right now!
and if they don't, what' d you gonna do?
blow out your brains like your wife did?
Hey, hey!
Hey, you okay? Did you hear that?
he assaulted me for an honest mistake.
God knows what would've happened if you hadn't been here.
let go!
dad, dad, dad. Come on.
come on. Come on, okay?
I talked to Mrs. Mccluskey, and for god's sake, Parker, you can't ask people things like that.
Why?
because it's rude.
I said "please."
well, that doesn't matter!
you gotta quit talking to people about their bodies, and about where, you know, babies come from.
Why?
because it's not an appropriate subject.
Why?
because it's not.
Why?
Ugh! Because it's dirty and wrong, and I'll wash your mouth out with soap! That's why.
in that moment, Lynette saw a look on her son's face she had never seen before...
and she thought of the look he had on his face when he had become obsessed with dinosaurs...obsessed with baseball and obsessed with trains.
and it occurred to Lynette she didn't need to shame her son.
all he needed was a brand-new obsession.
but I thought you said we couldn't have a puppy.
well. It turns out we really needed one.
you can go and play.
and though she didn't know it at the time, it would be another three years before Parker Scavo would ever ask about sex again.
Karl. What's going on?
uh, I'm on my way to a motel.
I just wanted to let you know that the wedding is off.
it is?
I told Edie I wasn't in love with her...at least, not in the way that she deserves.
why did you change your mind?
I mean, I hope it wasn't because of me, because I told you it wasn't for you.
no?
you were right.
I have been a coward.
I was a coward three years ago when I walked out on the two most important people in my life.
and I was being a coward with Edie.
I mean, to even consider marrying her when I know what real passion and real love feels like.
anyway, l just thought I'd let you know.
you look pretty beat up.
why don't you come in and we'll crack open a bottle of wine.
come on.
all right, here we go.
this is the last of Andrew's things.
once we tape up these boxes, we can start loading the car.
I'm proud of you, Bree.
you're being awfully big about this.
well, I have to admit, I was a bit upset at first.
but then it hit me. You're his grandparents.
you should bond, get to know the real Andrew.
Oh, dad, l forgot to warn you.
these are some of Andrew's adult videos.
I don't approve, but boys will be boys.
Oh, Henry, stop looking at that filth.
I don't get it.
where are the women?
what are you talking about?
this is all just a bunch of naked men.
sweet mother of god. What the hell are they doing?
I don't know, and I don't even know what I'm looking at.
Henry, this is pornography for ho-homosexuals.
Oh, shoot! I wish you hadn't gone through that.
now we have to have an unpleasant conversation, and we were having such a nice time.
is Andrew gay?
Oh, dad, Andrew hates labels. I'm sure it's just a phase.
excuse me, but he has a magazine titled "leather daddies in love."
that does not sound like a phase to me.
maybe not, but it's no longer my concern now that he'll be living with you.
we have to have a serious talk.
let's don't freak out about this.
the Dutch therapist says...
forget the Dutch therapist! In the kitchen!
now!
Hey, where's grandma and grandpa?
I need to start loading up my stuff.
Oh, they, uh, they already left.
wait, they left?
without me?
uh, yeah, they wrote you a letter.
it seems they came across some personal items of yours that, um, upset them.
they're taking away my trust fund?
they can't do that!
well, actually they can.
I mean, it's their money to dispense with as they see fit.
I know it doesn't seem fair, but...
no, it's really unfair. In fact, it sucks.
what... what am I supposed to do now?
well, now that you can't afford to become emancipated, I guess you're gonna have to stay here with me.
Andrew, we can make this work.
we just have to let go of our anger.
no.
Oh, I, um, had a chance to have a nice chat with Justin the other day.
he really seems very sweet.
I've invited him over for dinner tonight.
I hope you don't mind.
now I wish I hadn't torched our wedding photos.
who would've thought, after everything that's happened, that we would've ended up back here again?
it's been one hell of a ride, huh?
Yeah.
so how do you feel now?
about us?
Mm.
I feel good.
I feel happy.
you're not having second thoughts?
I can't believe you actually want to talk about feelings.
you really have changed.
Hey, this is the new Karl, baby.
he's not afraid to cry.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Edie.
uh... yeah, he's here.
hold on.
how does she know you're here?
I don't know.
Hi. Ahem.
Yeah, I just came by to help Julie with her civics homework.
Uh-huh.
okay, I'll take care of it. What kind of juice do you want?
right. Bye, bye.
are you getting juice for her?
Yeah, just one carton.
you ripped the woman's heart out.
why would she want juice from you?
okay. Now don't freak out, but this breakup is sort of a work in progress.
she doesn't know? Will you calm down? I can explain.
so if Edie doesn't know, then that means that you just cheated on her with me!
you made me the other woman! Please don't be angry. I tried to break up with her, but because I wasn't sure you wanted me back, the words just wouldn't come out of my mouth.
now that I know that you want me and love me again, it's a done deal.
get out of my house, you miserable son of a bitch!
can't we talk about this?
no, just get out! Get out!
Susie, Susie! Our marriage was garbage!
stupid, disgusting pile of garbage! No, no, don't say that.
and I regret everything that came of it! Don't do this right now.
Ugh! Except you, honey. You're my rock.
Ooh, out! Get out!
I... ugh!
I promise you I'm gonna break up the Edie and make this right.
I'll call you when it's done. Don't bother! I won't pick up.
we've all done something in our lives we're ashamed of.
some of us have fallen for the wrong man.
some have let go of the right woman.
there are those who have humiliated their parents and those who have failed their children.
Yes, we've all made mistakes that diminish us and those we love.
but there is redemption if we try to learn from those mistakes and grow.
sounds to me as if someone's let go of his rage.
maybe I have. Well, I haven't.
Felicia took matters into her own hands.
you want me to call off the wedding I'll do it.
I'll do whatever you want. Karl put the ball in Susan's court...
while Andrew tried to take Bree to court...there's a father. He's a kid!
Gabrielle and Carlos took the baby... the papers aren't valid anymore.
do you really wanna leave this beautiful little girl with that white trash freak show?
and ran with it.
Louispate believed in the power of shame.
as a teacher, she had found that the best way to control unruly students was to instill a strong sense of shame in their parents.
I left Trisha alone with the school hamster for only five minutes.
in this box is all that's left of patches.
for show and tell, Timmy decided to bring in something from your husband's collection of Nazi memorabilia.
Billy's been threatening to beat up the other kids for their milk money.
we found the proceeds in his cubby.
of course, Mrs. Pate also knew when it came to unruly children, some parents had more reason to be ashamed...than others.
so, um... your message said that Parker had been involved in some sort of serious incident.
what... what kind of incident?
yesterday afternoon, Parker offered a cookie to Cindy Lou Peeples if she would show him her vagina.
what kind of cookie?
what does that matter?
Oh, it doesn't.
I'm just stalling because I am completely mortified.
the kids were in a broom closet. Our janitor walked in on them just as Cindy was lifting up her pinafore. Oh, my goodness.
I'm sure you've noticed how obsessive Parker can be.
a certain subject will catch his interest, and that's all he'll talk about for weeks and weeks.
Oh, right. That happened with dinosaurs.
Oh, yes, we all remember his dinosaur phase.
more fondly now than ever.
Mm-hmm, so you think that now he's obsessed with what's underneath the pinafore. Yes.
look, I think he's just developed a normal curiosity about the human body.
you need to talk to him.
remind him what's appropriate and what isn't.
of course. I will talk to him.
I'll talk to him till I'm blue in the face.
I promise. Take care.
Yes, Louisa Pate believed in the power of shame.
she always believed, when someone has that power...
so, Mrs. Peeples, you'll never guess what your daughter is willing to do for a gingersnap.
it's a shame not to use it.
it had been six weeks since Andrew Van De Kamp had declared war on his mother Bree.
the final battle was about to be waged at the Fairview county courthouse.
Bree knew it was about to get bloody.
what she didn't know was the Calvary was on its way whether she wanted them there or not.
Oh, thank god I found you. This place is a maze.
what are you doing here?
well, your father and I got a call last night from Danielle, and she said that Andrew was taking you to court.
I mean, to say that we were shocked would be an understatement.
Hello, I'm Eleanor Mason, Bree's stepmother.
you're the lawyer? We should talk.
uh, no, I'm not her lawyer.
good. The hair had me worried.
Peter is mom's sponsor from A.A.
Oh, sweetie!
since when are you in A.A?
it's a recent development. Where's dad?
in chambers with the judge.
What?! Why?
everything is fine.
the judge agreed to a postponement.
Oh, thank God!
luckily, he remembered me. I spoke once at his law school.
pardon me, sir, I'm your daughter's lawyer.
just so you know, we've been waiting for this hearing for weeks, son, I've been an attorney for 45 years.
you and I both know how these cases can turn into public spectacles.
our family is perfectly capable of handling this in house.
dad, you don't understand. This has gotten really ugly.
that's why we're here.
we're gonna put this family back together.
whatever it takes.
and that's when Mr. And Mrs. Solis, fearing for the welfare of this helpless child, fled the hospital.
you mean, they kidnapped her.
well, technically, that's true, but given the situation that led up to the rescue kidnapping.
your Honor, yes, in retrospect, the plan was a little bit rash, not entirely well thought out.
idiotic.
can we object to that? Shh!
but the child is safe, Your Honor.
and all we ask the court is to allow baby Lily a lifetime of the care and love she has been receiving from the Solises.
as much as your story tugs at my heart, there is the issue of parental rights.
what does the state have to say about this?
we have located the biological father...Mr. Dale Helm.
unfortunately, uh, circumstances require that he be out of town.
he's in Fort Lauderdale today.
on business?
spring break, actually.
Mr. Helm is a high school student.
charming. In between keg stands, did the father happen to mention that says this "blows his mind" and he's extremely "bummed out."
all right...
Mr. And Mrs. Solis, since you actually want Lily, it seems you're the lesser of two evils.
I'm granting you temporary custody until we can get a straight answer from the birth father.
thank you, uh, Your Honor.
in the meantime, try not to steal any more babies.
Oh, we just needed the one.
sweetie?
um, could you put the crayons down for a second?
we need to talk.
so I spoke to your teacher today, and she told me about the cookie deal you made with Cindy Lou.
Oh. Are you mad?
no, not exactly. I'm just...I'm trying to understand why you did that.
Tommy Keenan told me babies come from down there.
it doesn't sound right to me.
Well...actually, he's kinda right. He's got the concept down.
that's weird. How's a baby get in there?
daddy will be home from his business trip in a few days.
why don't you wait for him?
okay. Okay.
or I can ask Tommy' s brother.
he's 14, and he knows everything.
and then the mommy and the daddy, because they love each other so much, they hug.
real tight.
and, uh, a seed is magically implanted.
and nine months later...a baby is born. Here.
what kind of seed?
Oh, that's not important.
I don't believe you.
Parker, I'm your mother. Mothers don't lie to their sons.
now go wash your hands or Santa' s not gonna bring you anything for Christmas.
I just saw Edie drive off. How long is she gonna be gone?
I don't know. She just went to show a house.
move.
what's the problem?
you mauled me in Edie's bed last night.
I think that deserves a conversation.
well, what's there to talk about? I'm just a fool in love.
Oh, no! You don't mean that.
Yes, I do. Look, I realize my timing's a little off.
a little?
okay... when are you gonna tell Edie? Tell her what?
that the wedding's off. Is it?
well, isn't it? It's up to you.
are... are you saying that you're gonna go through with this wedding unless I tell you not to?
just give me a commitment, Susie and I'll put a bullet in Edie. This is insane!
come on.
all this can be yours again.
just say the word... and I let go.
Oh, no! No, don't you dare!
you know you want me to. Just say it, Susie.
You're...sick!
Zach, I'm going to the drugstore.
I'll be back in 20 minutes.
Oh!
I was making cookies, and I heard the most sickening thud.
are you okay?
There's...shortening on my doorstep.
Shortening?
that's the last thing you'd want on your front porch.
it's meant for baking.
it was my grandmother's name.
so how you holding up? You must be exhausted.
you know, I'm a little tired, but it's not too bad. Oh, wait a couple months.
she'll start sleeping through the night.
Oh, honey, please. Do I look like a masochist?
firs thing tomorrow, I'm hiring a nanny and a night nurse.
no, we're not.
my husband, the comedian.
I'm serious. I don't want some stranger raising our baby.
well, you guys are busy. We should go.
no, it's okay. I'll win this battle later.
we are not gonna be some Yuppie couple
Yeah. Okay, bye.
good luck.
put down the burrito.
what is all this crap about me not getting help?
look, a brand-new baby needs to bond with its mother. The church knows it, science knows it, nature knows it.
we have the money. What is wrong with getting a little help?
then I'll be able to relax once in a while, and I'll be able to be a better mother.
do what my mam did... make sacrifices.
my mam worked her fingers to the bone for me.
and that's what put her in an early grave!
well, that and the hit-and-run thing.
look, I don't know why you want to be emancipated, and I don't know what you've been doing to drive him crazy.
bottom line... it's over.
it's now time for you two to kiss and make up.
and just how are we supposed to do that?
here's a thought...just look each other in the eye and say, "I forgive you."
it's actually a technique invent
I saw him on TV.
he says, if you verbalize forgiveness, I did it with our cleaning lady.
um, I'm sorry, dad, but I think my relationship with Andrew is just a bit more complicated than...
would it kill you to at least try?
I'll do it... for you, grandpa.
that's my boy. Bree?
fine!
Yes, um... so, um, who goes first?
either or. Doesn't matter.
mom, I forgive you.
Andrew, I forgive you.
that wasn't so hard, was it?
now don't expect to feel differently right away.
it takes a while. It took me a week to forgive Esperanza.
but now she's like family again. Family who stole from us.
how'd
um...
well, grandpa, I'm... I'm still gonna need my trust fund.
you see, l-I can't live in a place where I... I don't feel safe.
what are you talking about?
well, could you live with a woman who hits you?
Bree! I slapped him once, and he deserved it.
well, I just asked her to stop drinking.
you were drinking?
she's in A.A. Her sponsor has long hair.
Andrew, I find your concern ironic, given how tanked you were when you ran or our neighbor's mother with your car.
is she okay? She's dead!
mom watched as her boyfriend committed suicide.
and he was the same guy who killed dad!
andrew falsely accused me of molestation in a mall!
you know, the technique works best if you don't talk right away.
okay, let's go. I don't wanna be late for the movie.
Oh, those are pretty. Who sent those?
what?
say the word and I'm yours. Love, Karl.
mom, I knew this would happen when you started hanging around together, all of your old feelings resurfacing.
no, his feelings.
he's the one with the feelings, not me.
Uh-huh.
okay, don't "uh-huh" me. You're not old enough to do that.
Oh, no? Well, how do you like this.
I'm not gonna go to the movies with you. You're gonna make me go by myself?
well, you could always ask dad to go.
in fact, if you love him so much, why don't you marry him?
Oh, wait, you already did. Twice.
Oh, you know what?
I think we're gonna need some napkins with this.
Oh, okay, I'll go back. Thanks.
my ex-boyfriend's here. If he sees me alone, I'll die.
I'm begging you, please, act like you know me.
Susan? Hey!
Mike, hi! What a surprise.
how are you? Good.
Oh! God, l... I'm being so rude.
um, mike, l-I want you to meet...
nice to meet you, Mike.
wow, I can't believe I'm finally seeing the man himself in the flesh.
so... how' d you two meet?
Oh, god, I've been her dentist for years.
but last week, I was looking in her mouth and decided to stick my tongue in it.
I'll see you, Susan.
thank you so much for helping me out.
Hey, I'm great in a crisis.
well, I definitely picked the right person to sit next to.
actually, is this seat taken?
no.
okay, you can share my popcorn.
um, Susan,this is Becky.
I'll probably be sharing her popcorn.
I'll just wait till the lights go out, and then I'll...
while I get this going, can you bring out the buns?
uh, yeah.
what the hell? You all right?
this isn't lighter fluid. It's gasoline.
what?
How' d that get in there?
how do you think?
something smells good over there.
well, I don't understand. Is she trying to kill you?
no, she's trying to piss me off.
Why?
I'm not sure yet, but I do know I'm not gonna play along.
we got plenty of burgers if you want to pop over.
and bring your appetite.
Gaby, the baby.
no, I got up twice already. It's your turn.
Gaby, I have several job interviews tomorrow.
I need my sleep.
what about my sleep?
you sleep when the baby sleeps.
every 40 minutes?
when am I supposed to have a life?
what are you whining about?
you know, Xiao-mei does all the housework around here.
all you have to do is take care of the baby.
fine, fine, fine!
xiao-mei.
psst, wake up.
Mrs. Solis?
something wrong?
the baby won't stop crying, and I haven't slept for two days.
will you please take Lily for a while? Uh...
Oh, come on. I won't make you do windows tomorrow.
okay. What do I do?
well, she's a baby. You hold her.
you bounce her and, I don't know, maybe sing a little something.
Oh, and Xiao-mei, Mr. Solis does not need to know about this, okay? Okay.
okay.
Yeah, honey, can you take that downstairs?
thank you.
Eleanor, I thought you'd gone to bed.
Oh, no, not yet. I had to do my hair now.
there's never enough time in the morning.
uh, sit.
there's something I have to discuss with you.
your father and I have decided to take Andrew back to Rhode Island with us.
Really?
and whose idea was that?
Andrew's.
but Henry and I feel it's the right thing to do.
absolutely not.
if we leave him here, the two of you will wind up in court, and I'm not going to all that.
do you really think that I am enjoy airing my dirty laundry in public?
this whole situation is mortifying.
I've always admired that about you.
when you were a kid, you used to make these peanut butter cookies that were god-awful.
but you kept baking them, and you kept forcing everyone to eat them.
you were so determined to get them right.
my mother didn't think they were awful.
when I made those same cookies for her, she loved them.
well, some people praise children even when they don't deserve it.
Oh, but not you.
with you, I had to work for every kind word I ever got.
well, you always resented me because of my high standards.
no.
I resented you because those were kick-ass peanut butter cookies.
we're taking Andrew.
Eleanor, please...
he hates you, Bree.
your own son.
you know, part of being an adult is admitting that you've failed, and then moving on with grace.
do you really think that I am a failure as a parent?
well, I'd love to lie and say something supportive, but as you pointed out, that was more your mother's thing.
Xiao-mei?
so sorry. I just take break.
Oh, no, Xiao-mei, that's okay. That's okay.
I know you were up all night with the baby, and I really appreciate it.
you know, I'm very grateful for everything you've been doing for Lily.
so to thank you, I bought you a gift certificate to my spa.
and you can take a whole day off and just really pamper yourself.
Really? Mm-hmm.
thank you!
Oh, thank you!
Oh, you're welcome.
all right, Lily needs to be bathed and put to bed.
I don't wanna miss my yoga class. Hi.
Hi, pretty girl. Oh, yes, mommy has to go.
mommy has to go, so she can stay pretty and thin and you can be proud of her.
motherhood is such a blessing.
I hope you get to experience it one day.
because it's not a big deal!
it's not a big deal? Okay!
it's not that far away. Right. Oh, it's not that far away?
dude, it... whatever, okay?
you didn't even care to tell me before? Bye.
Justin, what happened?
andrew just told me he's moving in with his grandparents.
they live so far away, I'm never gonna see him anymore.
I'm so sorry. I know that you're good friends.
we're more than friends, Mrs. Van De Kamp.
I love him.
Oh.
Why?
Why?
Yes. I'd be curious to know just what it is you see in him.
well, when my parents first heard I was gay, they kicked me out.
they said I had debased the entire family and that they couldn't love me anymore until I changed.
but Andrew... he said that I should be ashamed of them, 'cause they were too stupid to know how great I was.
that's the thing about Andrew.
he doesn't take crap from anyone.
how can you not love someone like that?
you know, it never ceases to amaze me how people can turn their backs on their own family.
I mean... but it happens every day, doesn't it?
I guess.
you know, Justin, if you would be willing to help, I'm pretty sure that I could find a way to keep Andrew from moving.
what do you say?
I'm home.
Oh, hi.
Hey, Mrs. Mccluskey.
so how did everything go?
fine. Penny fussed a bit.
I think her molars are coming in. Oh.
and the twins fought over the remote.
there's nothing new there. No.
here's the big news.
Parker offered me a Fudgsicle if I would show him my vagina.
Oh, good God, Lynette, relax. I didn't do it.
I just got this out of the freezer a second ago.
uh, yeah. Of course. No, sorry.
apparently, Parker wanted to put a sunflower seed inside me and see if a baby would grow. Where do kids get this stuff?
Oh... that was me.
he was asking about the birds and the bees, and I fudged a few of the details.
well, he's only 7 years old.
I don't think he needs to know everything yet.
I don't wanna rob him of his innocence.
well, now, that's where you're wrong.
you get 'em when they're young.
give them all the gory details.
and then when they're good and disgusted, you shame 'em.
excuse me?
you tell them sex is dirty and wrong and he shouldn't talk about it, and if he does, he's going straight to hell.
that is ridiculous.
spoken like a true liberal idiot.
no, I'm not gonna shame my son.
mm, I'm telling you, it works.
it keeps people in their place, it keeps parents from being humiliated, and it keeps me from having to spend the afternoon talking about my woo-woo.
in your haste to duck out before the credits rolled, you...
Oh, my God! Oh, thank you so much.
I stuck a card in there, just in case you ever wanted to purposely sit next to me at a movie, so...
Orson, I'm flattered. Uh, really.
you... you don't wanna date me.
I mean, my love life is just so complicated right now.
well... no, I won't bore you with the details.
so the ex-boyfriend has no idea you're secretly married to the ex-husband, who still loves you, but unless you give him a reason not to, is gonna marry the neighborhood slut?
did I call Edie a slut? Mm-hmm.
well, that's overstating it. Edie's not a slut.
she's just popular with indiscriminate men.
anyway, yes, those are the relevant players.
okay. Now I'm absolutely horrified that I'm about to say what I'm about to say, but there's nobody else I can talk to who won't judge me.
and since you're a complete stranger, I'll probably never see you again unless I randomly run into you on the street, in which case, you'll ignore me 'cause you know how crazy I am.
so here goes...I'm having feelings for Karl again.
does that make me a terrible person?
you want my unvarnished opinion?
lay it on me.
it doesn't make you a terrible person, but it does make you a...well... a sucker.
this Karl's a coward.
he wants you to be the heavy and take all the responsibility.
if you're having feelings for a guy like that, I say run far, far away.
he lives three houses down.
hmm. Well, good luck to you, then.
but like I said, if you're interested in a tooth whitening, my card's still in your wallet.
Xiao-mei?
Xiao-mei?
I'm late to meet Mrs. Van De Kamp.
I'll be back in a little while.
Bree, I'm so sorry I'm late.
Oh, honey, it's all right.
I mean, with the new baby at home, I'm surprised you made it at all.
Ooh, I'll have a drink. Anything with an umbrella.
so tell me, how are you doing?
I mean, your entire world must be turned upside down.
you must be exhausted.
you know, it's been challenging, but l soldier on.
so what about you? You look so rested.
I just got a massage at Misty Spring.
things have been a little tense at home, and I needed an hour to relax.
good for you. I love that spa.
Mm. Um, oh, by the way, while I was there, I saw your, uh, your housekeeper.
Xiao-mei?
Oh, no, you must be mistaken.
I just left her. She's at home working.
are you sure? I was talking to her in the steam room for about 20 minutes. What?
Yeah, apparently you gave her a gift certificate.
Lily, mommy's coming!
Oh, thank God! Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.
I'm never gonna leave you again. Oh!
Yes. Yes.
I'm home!
my interview got canceled.
Oh, that's my little girl.
your chakra lining up nice for mommy?
that's my girl.
Hey, let me take her off your chest so you can do your yoga.
No! No, no, no. We're doing just fine.
aren't we, Lily?
Bridezilla's got me auditioning wedding bands, and I'm clueless about Edie's taste in music.
what do you think of these guys?
that's why you brought me down here? Mm-hmm.
Karl, you made it sound like it was an emergency.
it is! I need to have somebody to dance with so I can see if these guys have the power to help me get my groove on.
Oh, that's right.
you like it laid-back and romantic, don't you?
guys, can we play something mellow?
no, don't bother, 'cause I'm going.
Two...that was not a coincidence.
this was playing the night we first kissed.
I remember. I also remember that you are planning on marrying someone else.
not if you don't want me to.
come on, Susie.
I can see you still have feelings for me, and I know I have never stopped loving you.
okay, you want the truth?
I don't know how I feel about you, but I keep looking at you, trying to see if you've changed, if you've grown up.
you know what I see?
I see the same weak coward that walked out on me three years ago.
of course I've changed.
I don't think so.
so I think you should probably stay with Edie.
and the band is good. You should hire 'em.
what the hell?
for god's sake, what the hell are you doing in there?!
this is my house. What are you doing?
we're tenting for termites. We got a work order.
signed by who?
I've never been so embarrassed in my whole life.
they're supposed to be tenting my house.
I must've written the address down wrong.
you've taken it too far this time.
these little mind games are gonna stop right now!
and if they don't, what' d you gonna do?
blow out your brains like your wife did?
Hey, hey!
Hey, you okay? Did you hear that?
he assaulted me for an honest mistake.
God knows what would've happened if you hadn't been here.
let go!
dad, dad, dad. Come on.
come on. Come on, okay?
I talked to Mrs. Mccluskey, and for god's sake, Parker, you can't ask people things like that.
Why?
because it's rude.
I said "please."
well, that doesn't matter!
you gotta quit talking to people about their bodies, and about where, you know, babies come from.
Why?
because it's not an appropriate subject.
Why?
because it's not.
Why?
Ugh! Because it's dirty and wrong, and I'll wash your mouth out with soap! That's why.
in that moment, Lynette saw a look on her son's face she had never seen before...
and she thought of the look he had on his face when he had become obsessed with dinosaurs...obsessed with baseball and obsessed with trains.
and it occurred to Lynette she didn't need to shame her son.
all he needed was a brand-new obsession.
but I thought you said we couldn't have a puppy.
well. It turns out we really needed one.
you can go and play.
and though she didn't know it at the time, it would be another three years before Parker Scavo would ever ask about sex again.
Karl. What's going on?
uh, I'm on my way to a motel.
I just wanted to let you know that the wedding is off.
it is?
I told Edie I wasn't in love with her...at least, not in the way that she deserves.
why did you change your mind?
I mean, I hope it wasn't because of me, because I told you it wasn't for you.
no?
you were right.
I have been a coward.
I was a coward three years ago when I walked out on the two most important people in my life.
and I was being a coward with Edie.
I mean, to even consider marrying her when I know what real passion and real love feels like.
anyway, l just thought I'd let you know.
you look pretty beat up.
why don't you come in and we'll crack open a bottle of wine.
come on.
all right, here we go.
this is the last of Andrew's things.
once we tape up these boxes, we can start loading the car.
I'm proud of you, Bree.
you're being awfully big about this.
well, I have to admit, I was a bit upset at first.
but then it hit me. You're his grandparents.
you should bond, get to know the real Andrew.
Oh, dad, l forgot to warn you.
these are some of Andrew's adult videos.
I don't approve, but boys will be boys.
Oh, Henry, stop looking at that filth.
I don't get it.
where are the women?
what are you talking about?
this is all just a bunch of naked men.
sweet mother of god. What the hell are they doing?
I don't know, and I don't even know what I'm looking at.
Henry, this is pornography for ho-homosexuals.
Oh, shoot! I wish you hadn't gone through that.
now we have to have an unpleasant conversation, and we were having such a nice time.
is Andrew gay?
Oh, dad, Andrew hates labels. I'm sure it's just a phase.
excuse me, but he has a magazine titled "leather daddies in love."
that does not sound like a phase to me.
maybe not, but it's no longer my concern now that he'll be living with you.
we have to have a serious talk.
let's don't freak out about this.
the Dutch therapist says...
forget the Dutch therapist! In the kitchen!
now!
Hey, where's grandma and grandpa?
I need to start loading up my stuff.
Oh, they, uh, they already left.
wait, they left?
without me?
uh, yeah, they wrote you a letter.
it seems they came across some personal items of yours that, um, upset them.
they're taking away my trust fund?
they can't do that!
well, actually they can.
I mean, it's their money to dispense with as they see fit.
I know it doesn't seem fair, but...
no, it's really unfair. In fact, it sucks.
what... what am I supposed to do now?
well, now that you can't afford to become emancipated, I guess you're gonna have to stay here with me.
Andrew, we can make this work.
we just have to let go of our anger.
no.
Oh, I, um, had a chance to have a nice chat with Justin the other day.
he really seems very sweet.
I've invited him over for dinner tonight.
I hope you don't mind.
now I wish I hadn't torched our wedding photos.
who would've thought, after everything that's happened, that we would've ended up back here again?
it's been one hell of a ride, huh?
Yeah.
so how do you feel now?
about us?
Mm.
I feel good.
I feel happy.
you're not having second thoughts?
I can't believe you actually want to talk about feelings.
you really have changed.
Hey, this is the new Karl, baby.
he's not afraid to cry.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Edie.
uh... yeah, he's here.
hold on.
how does she know you're here?
I don't know.
Hi. Ahem.
Yeah, I just came by to help Julie with her civics homework.
Uh-huh.
okay, I'll take care of it. What kind of juice do you want?
right. Bye, bye.
are you getting juice for her?
Yeah, just one carton.
you ripped the woman's heart out.
why would she want juice from you?
okay. Now don't freak out, but this breakup is sort of a work in progress.
she doesn't know? Will you calm down? I can explain.
so if Edie doesn't know, then that means that you just cheated on her with me!
you made me the other woman! Please don't be angry. I tried to break up with her, but because I wasn't sure you wanted me back, the words just wouldn't come out of my mouth.
now that I know that you want me and love me again, it's a done deal.
get out of my house, you miserable son of a bitch!
can't we talk about this?
no, just get out! Get out!
Susie, Susie! Our marriage was garbage!
stupid, disgusting pile of garbage! No, no, don't say that.
and I regret everything that came of it! Don't do this right now.
Ugh! Except you, honey. You're my rock.
Ooh, out! Get out!
I... ugh!
I promise you I'm gonna break up the Edie and make this right.
I'll call you when it's done. Don't bother! I won't pick up.
we've all done something in our lives we're ashamed of.
some of us have fallen for the wrong man.
some have let go of the right woman.
there are those who have humiliated their parents and those who have failed their children.
Yes, we've all made mistakes that diminish us and those we love.
but there is redemption if we try to learn from those mistakes and grow.
packed 'em up? Why? - She followed you to atlantic city.
she knows about your other woman.
things went from bad...
put your hands where I can see 'em.
to considerably worse.
Oh, man, she's good.
looks like the insemination was Successful.
and even the good news...
she's the priority now. She's the mother of my child.
came with a catch.
given any thought to staying at my place? - I think I'm gonna have to pass.
you know, I'm stronger than people give me credit for.
but sometimes once you accept the truth...
you discover that you're capable...
let's just get out of here.
of accomplishing
I'd like to admit myself for psychiatric observation.
I'm about to have a nervous breakdown.
almost anything.
it's a fact of life in every neighborhood
people move in and people move out.
although very few of them pack up and leave at 2: 00 in the morning.
but it wasn't the first time that betty applewhite had tried to leave in the middle of the night.
it had happened once before...
in chicago...
the same night one of her sons tried to break up with his girlfriend...
a young woman named melanie foer.
are you kidding? You cannot dump me. I do not get dumped.
if anyone is getting dumped here, it's you. -However you wanna spin it is fine, okay?
I just want out. I just want out!
okay, matthew.
maybe I am a bitch sometimes, but there are advantages and I know that you know what I'm talking about.
you-- - melanie, my mother is in the other room.
are you crazy?
clearly, we can't have a serious discussion here.
why don't you met me at the lumberyard at 9: 00?
Melanie... - What？
it's over.
well, even more reason for you to show up. No one can say good-bye better than I do.
Oh, it's about time.
what are you doing here? Where's matthew?
I got here first.
I-I know a shortcut.
does matthew know that you're here?
no.
he--he doesn't wanna be with you anymore.
what does that have to do with you?
see, I thought...
maybe... I could be your boyfriend now.
what?
I love you.
Oh, god, please tell me someone put you up to this. No?
cause if you're serious, it's too pathetic.
God, what the hell are you doing?!
get off of me, you freak!
Yes, a year had come and gone since the applewhites had left chicago, and betty thought they could again slip away in the middle of the night.
once we move, how is matty gon' find us?
Caleb, I think it's just gonna be you and me from now on.
stop! Let me see your hands! Put your hands up!
but as she soon discovered, it's not that easy to slip away in the suburbs, because in suburbia, once the neighbors hear you're going, they all insist on showing up...
to say good-bye.
the Desperate Housewives
everyone must choose the road they will take in life, and for a special few, that road would lead to wisteria lane.
they all arrive the exact same way...
driving up in their overloaded trucks...
bringing with them their expensive antiques and ordinary dreams.
I remember the first moment I saw each of them.
I met susan mayer the day she moved to wisteria lane.
Ah! Okay, break time's over.
she seemed so delightfully confident, I couldn't help but feel intimidated.
that feeling quicklyassed.
Oh, help!
can anybody hear me?!
I need you to try to unlock the door. Oh, what am I saying? She's 2.
okay, I need you to unbuckle yourself and try to find a neighbor...
but don't cross the street!
just tell the neighbor that your mommy's stuck in a big truck!
Oh, yes! Oh, my god! I have a genius baby!
Oh, hi. - Hi.
I have a normal baby.
I'm mary alice. I live across the street.
Susan mayer I live across the street.
um, if my husband had to rescue me, oh, I just--I would have never heard the end of it. He thinks i'm a total klutz.
Oh, please, that's what neighbors are for.
welcome to wisteria lane.
when you're finished unpacking, why don't you come over for a cup of coffee?
I have a neighbor who just asked me over for coffee.
you must think I'm a lunatic. - Oh, no, no, I don't.
I think you're charming.
and your baby looks like a genius to me.
Oh, she is.
and we're gonna be so happy here.
look at your new home.
you're not gonna walk me into a wall - Of course not but when you see it for the first time, I want you to get the whole impact.
okay, now I know it's a little more cramped than we're used to, but we can't stay at bree's forever.
she's gonna be coming back from that spa vacation soon.
besides, it's gonna be fun.
why are you doing this to me?
I get good grades. I don't do drugs. I've never come home pregnant.
honey, I am trying my hardest to stand on my own two feet.
all right, I've got six book proposals in the works.
I'm gonna try to supervise the rebuilding of this house, but you know, I can't do it without your support.
and I want you to be proud of me.
fine.
let's take a look inside. - Ohh! That's my girl.
so... is there anything you should prepare me for? - No! No. It's all good.
Oh! But you should know that your bed doubles as the dining table, and the toilet's in the shower.
honey, look.
I bought us matching golf outfits for our lessons tomorrow.
Yeah, about that--I can't go. I gotta pick up trash on the freeway.
I'm sorry? - I have to do my community service.
it's part of my parole, remember?
Oh, okay, well, I'll just call the country club and cancel our lessons. - No, no, no.
I mean, I paid already.
might as well go without me. - I don't wanna go alone. It was your idea in the first place.
and I'd love to be there with you, too, if I didn't have to scrape slushies and condoms off route 57.
look, what's the big deal? Just go take the stupid lesson. - Fine, if you feel that way about it.
Hey, I'm sorry.
all right? I'm just a little on edge today.
Oh, would you look at this crap? He has been doing that all day.
Ralph has a little crush. So?
so can't I get a gardener who isn't trying to sleep with someone in my house?
you pay 6 bucks an hour. It's all about the perks, honey.
Susan, have you talked to lynette? - Uh, no.
have you trieder cell? - Yeah, she isn't picking up. Do you know where she is?
uh, no, I'm sorry. - Susan, Susan, I think you do.
I really don't, tom. Is everything okay?
Yeah. Yeah, we just had a fight.
listen, if you talk to her, will you please ask her to call me?
thank you.
he was just here.
I think you should call him.
I can'T. I can'T.
I'm sorry. I just can'T.
Yeah. Hang on.
I'll call you later. Okay. Bye.
yeah? - When is daddy coming?
I wanna show him my dive. - He's not coming, sweetheart.
but you could show me.
you have to talk to noah.
but he creeps me out. - Who cares? This is my life we're talking about.
I need a big-time lawyer in my corner, and where else are we gonna get that kind of money?
Noah's not gonna give me a dime if he knows it's for you.
he hates your guts. - Tell him it's for you.
tell him you want a car. Tell him you're ready for him to buy your love.
trust me. Dying men are nothing if not sentimental.
why do you need so much, anyway?
I thought only guilty men needed expensive lawyers.
Felicia has obviously been planning this for months.
who knows what other kind of evidence she's planted?
with my luck, they'll open up the martha huber murder again, try to nail me with some D. N.A.
you swore to me that you had nothing to do with that.
I didn't.
look, why are we arguing? I'm your father. Do what I'm telling you to do.
you're not my real father.
you ungrateful little...
I rescue you from that miserable junkie. I give you a home, a life worth living, and now you're making me beg for one lousy little favor?
I need the money, zach.
if you won't do it for me, at least do it for your mother.
after all, she killed herself trying to protect you.
I met bree van de kamp the first day she moved to wisteria lane.
there are certain people, who, when you meet them, can't help but make a delightful first impression.
hello. I'm bree van de kamp, your new neighbor.
is this your frog?
Bree was not one of them.
Yes. Why? - Well, it seems that my son stole it from your yard.
Oh, well, I don't mind. If he likes it so much, he's welcome to keep it.
well, don't tell him that.
if he doesn't feel guilty, he'll never learn shame.
Hey, what's going on?
Oh. Um, this i our new neighbor. It seems her son accidentally took my garden frog.
please don't make excuses for him. That is exactly what his father does.
this is my husband rex.
Hi. We're not weird. We just seem like we are.
and this is my son...
the criminal.
go on.
I'm sorry I stole from you.
just so you know, my mom did teach me right from wrong, so my actions should in no way influence your opinion of her as a parent.
well, is there anything you'd like to say to my son?
feel free to be harsh.
no, I'M... I'm good.
well, now that we've finished with all this unpleasantness,
I want to assure you that we are going to be good neighbors, and I hope in time, great friends.
that sounds... lovely.
come on.
I'm--I'm sorry.
it was rex, andrew and...
what was your name again?
what?
you're bree van de kamp, right?
do I know you?
uh, susan's dentist friend.
we met after her house burned down.
Oh. I'm so sorry. I didn't recognize you.
small word, huh?
Yes. Uh, excruciatingly so.
what are you doing here?
well, three or four times a week, I visit my--my friend.
what about you?
Oh, I just thought it be a lovely place to take a nice, long rest.
um, listen, I told my friends that i was, um, I was at a spa, so if you run into susan, - I-- - your secret is safe.
and seriously...I am not like these other people.
Oh, I can tell.
a real lady always stands out in a crowd.
well, that was...very sweet.
enjoy your rest,
boy, do I feel for you.
trying to convince your friends that you're still normal, and you're surrounded by a bunch of loons.
you, too?
Dr. Barr goes out of his way to make me feel like a complete psychopath.
I think he's crazier than the patients, actually.
you know that, um, that woman in the wheelchair?
what's her story?
Yeah, she's a kooky one.
she hasn't spoken a word since she got here. She just sits there all day long, waiting for your friend to come and visit.
he talks to her for hours, but I don't even think she can hear him.
you said to stop by for coffee sometime.
I got coffee.
so I can't believe you caught me spraying for ants. I must look like a wreck.
actually, you look kinda sexy.
you've gotta be kidding.
Oh, the way you're taking charge-- it's impressive.
they're just ants, and they're tiny.
of course, they do outnumber me.
Oh, you said you wanted to handle things yourself, and you're making it happen.
Thanks.
even if it does mean you're not in the market for a relationship right now.
Oh. Did I say that?
you certainly implied it.
well, sometimes I say things i don't mean.
I blame it on my frequent exposure to ant spray.
what the hell is this? - Karl. What do you want?
well, I can't believe you're forcing our daughter to live in a house with wheels.
I think we need to talk about this. - It's temporary, and if you don't mind, I'm having coffee.
Oh, it's okay, susan.
Hey, sorry. I don't mean to chase you out, buddy, but, uh, this is really a family thing.
Oh, no, I understand. - Cool.
I'll call you later.
you've got a great swing.
you just need a little help around the greens.
you know what they say-- drive for show, putt for dough. Am I right?
that is so true. - All right. I'll see you out there.
okay.
make me something strong. I have nine more holes with that guy.
Jim, it was just an hour ago that the road crew working here on route 57 saw a member of their own killed by oncoming traffic.
the victim was a hispanic male in his early 40s who, for years, was a prominent businessman in the area.
police aren't releasing a name until the next of kin can be notified.
we, of course, will keep you updated... on any late-breaking developments as this tragic story unfolds.
reporting live from route 57,
Mrs. Solis!
why you home?
Carlos is dead, xiao-mei.
no, please don't kill him.
no, you don't understand. He's already dead.
there was an accident. He's all over the highway.
no...
he in kitchen.
Hey, babe. Why you home so early?
Oh, honey!
Oh, you're not dead!
who said I was dead?
the police. They called me.
what are you talking about?
honey, they didn't know all the details, but a witness said that they saw you run into the carpool lane to pick up a lawn chair that had fallen off some truck, and then a bus hit you right in front of the road crew.
why aren't you at the road crew?
I paid ralph to go in my place.
what?
well, carlos, they had your name.
Oh, no. Poor ralph.
why is your back all sweaty?
I was working out on the treadmill.
barefoot?
for god sakes, gabrielle, ralph just died, and you're worried about my feet?
I mean, what the hell is wrong with you?
my fault. - Sorry.
you must find that very peaceful.
why would you assume that?
because that's all you've been doing for three sessions.
I still don't know anything about you, except that you rake in remarkably straight lines.
is that what you're doing, asking me all those ridiculous questns about my childhood, trying to get to know me?
well, here's a clue. I'm not crazy. I just have a few issues.
and psychotherapy is how we help you deal with those issues.
what kind of treatment did you think you were going to get?
honestly, I was hoping that you'd medicate the hell out of me.
you don't need anything stronger than what I've already prescribed for you.
I have aspirin at home that packs more of a punch.
it says here your husband died, you had a boyfriend who killed himself, and you suffer from alcoholism.
that's a lot of trauma for one year.
what about your kids?
Oh, they're fine.
andrew is backpacking through europe, and danielle is away at cheerleading camp.
what's your relationship with them like?
what do you mean? - Are you close?
do they share things with you?
what do you feel about them?
you know, I really don'thave time for this nonsense. Are you going to give me some serious drugs or not?
no. - Fine. Then I'm going back to my room.
you know, bree, I can't force you to open up to me, but I can make it easier for you to focus on your problems.
and how are you going to do that?
I'm going to tell the orderlies to confiscate all your personal items.
I committed myself voluntarily.
when you signed those papers, I became responsible for your well-being, and I will help you in any way I see fit.
I don't need that much help, because I am not like your other patients.
Oh, sure, you are. You just don't know it yet.
your son confessed to murder. We've got it on tape.
my son has the mind of a child, detective.
he'd confess to sinking the "titanic.
this letter was sent some months ago to the chicago police, saying the person they arrested for the melanie foster murder was innocent.
we have a hunch yo wrote it.
Really? I didn't know hunches were considered evidence in a court of law.
they aren't
but this is.
we found some of the assailant's D. N.A. On this jacket.
now all we need is a matching sample.
you, by any chance, recognize the jacket?
it's not caleb's.
you can try and deny it, - but... - no.
you don't understand.
that jacket belongs to my other son.
and out of nowhere, he just attacked me.
my brother's never been violent.
I'm sure he didn't mean to hurt you. - But he did.
let me just take you home.
this has been pretty traumatic for me.
I-I-I think that you should come over for the next few days so we can talk it out.
we broke up, mel. It is not my job to hold your hand.
well, maybe I shouldn't go home right away.
maybe I should go to the cops first.
the cops? - I was attacked.
it's my civic duty to report it, don't you think?
Mel, I just told you that caleb did not mean to do what he did, okay?
Melanie, please. - Screw you.
no, you cannot tell anybody about this!
I can tell who I want! Get your hands off of me!
we're talking about my brother here!
your brother is going to go to jail for the next ten years, so I say let go!
Melanie! - What?!
you leave my family alone!
we all met lynette scavo the day she moved onto wisteria lane.
we quickly decided she would be our friend, mostly because we were afraid to have her as an enemy.
...playing russian roulette with my ovaries and... -...lynette!
hi - Hi
Hi. Uh, we just wanted to come welcome you to the neighborhood.
um, but we could come back later.
Yeah. - No, wait. Actually, wait.
this is perfect. You know why? Because we need some impartial judges.
let's suppose your husband begged you to get pregnant
and out of the goodness of your heart, you agreed, even though it might derail your career.
you agreed to a baby. A baby, singular.
Lynette, we've just met these people.
then--then you go in for an ultrasound, and you hear two heartbeats.
then and only then does your husband tell you that twins run in his family.
I didn't think it was that big a deal!
your family had eight sets of twins over three generations, not to mention your relatives in kentucky with triplets!
triplets! So I ask you, do I not deserve to punish this man severely?
well, actually, I think that twins are genetically determined by the mother.
what are you, a scientist?
no. No, I write children's books.
um, we, uh, just came over to introduce ourselves, but we can, um, do that at another time.
no, wait. Please stay.
it's okay. We're okay. We're okay, right?
honey, we don't wanna freak out the new neighbors.
I'm sorry that you saw my panic attack. I won't let it happen again, especially since this is my last pregnancy.
right. You're the boss. I'm just your love slave.
well, don't encourage him.
honey, clearly, our new neighbore that you have been gifted with a phenomenal husband.
cannonball!
guys? Could you come here for a second?
we need to have a serious talk.
okay, we have had a great... vacation, but tomorrow we're going home.
except we're not going to our home.
we're gonna go stay with grandma.
is dad gonna be there?
no, dad is not gonna be there, but he--he is gonna come and see you guys all the time.
we are still gonna be a family.
it's just...
we won't be living in the same place anymore.
so...
is there any questions you wanna ask me?
can we go swimming now?
Yeah!
cannonball!
Mike, what a surprise.
Yeah. How's it goin'?
good, good. I'M...just came in to get a new battery for my watch.
so... whatcha doin'?
Oh, just buying something for my grandma.
it's her 90th birthday. - Here we go.
this will sweep her right off her feet.
it's elegant, and she can build on it for anniversaries.
lucky grandma.
you dog. You're gonna ask susan to marry you, aren't you?
I didn't say that. - Man, I'm cool.
as far as I'm concerned, san's old news, so... mazel tov.
I don't suppose there's any hope of you keeping your mouth shut about this, is there? I wanted to surprise her.
Oh, trust me, brother. She'll be surprised, and not just by how small that rock is.
look, I-I know it's an expensive car, but I need one, so can I get the money?
you're a lousy liar, kid.
I read the papers. I know what happened to your father.
my guess is he's in the market for a fancy lawyer to get him some rich man's justice.
please.
paul young put deirdre in a box.
my daughter. Your mother.
so we're clear,
I don't write checks to monsters.
why can't you just give me the money?
you're dying. You don't need it. I do.
don't cry, zach. It pisses me off.
well, you said all of this was gonna be mine, so when do I get it?!
empire" is a highfalutin word, but that's what I've built.
unfortunately...
an empire can only be ruled by an iron fist and a strong gut.
I wanted to give it to you, zach but I'm starting to have my doubts about you.
so what?
are you cutting me off?
I don't have any use for weakness.
get out.
what, are you gonna kill me?
prove you're a tough guy?
see? That's why I can't give you the keys to the kingdom,
no balls.
we met gabrielle solis the day she moved to wisteria lane.
we were all excited to get a glimpse of a successful new york model.
Hello?
we saw more...
hi there.
than we bargained for.
I'm mary alice. This is susan, uh, lynette and bree.
welcome to the neighborhood.
well, I am gabrielle solis.
would it be better if we came back at another time?
Oh! No, no. I was...just changing out of my sweaty clothes.
out of my sweaty clothes. moving was such great cardio.
Hey, babe, we haven't tried it in the kitchen yet.
honey, uh, I think it's time to unpack the pants.
right.
it's nice to meet you ladies.
let me guess--newlyweds?
four months, and I've dressed like this for two of 'em.
he's insatiable.
Hey, what are you doing?
trying to have sex with you.
now? Babe, it's kind of late.
you don't wanna have sex with me?
you always wanna have sex with me.
you wanted to have sex with me an hour after your hernia operation.
I'm a little preoccupied.
a good man died today.
don't take it personally.
Xiao-mei said the strangest thing to me.
when I told her you were dead, she said, "please don't kill him.
that poor kid.
Oh. We really need to get her some english lessons.
Julie, what are you doing?
I'm trying to sleep.
morning, ladies. - Karl! What are you doing?
I've got a little surprise planned for my girls.
so just sit back and relax. We'll be there shortly.
no, no, no, no. No, turn my house around.
latte?
out to the right, ladies.
my gift to you.
you bought us a house?
let's have a look around. There's three bedrooms, a gourmet kitchen...
for what it's worth.
there's a guest house in the back that you could use as a studio.
there's a pool. - A pool? Really? Aah!
what's the catch?
there's no catch. It's yours, susie.
yours and julie's, no strings attached.
I can't accept this.
I just--I gotta get out of this mess on my own.
this is not charity.
I owe you...for everything I've done over the years, for all the heartache i've inflicted on you.
consider it payback.
mom!
there's a pool and a jacuzzi!
at least no one can drive off with it while you're sleeping, huh?
Hey, it's susan. Just wanted you to know I let the electrician in your house. a great time at the spa.
Bree, hi. It's betty. I'm--I'm sorry to leave this on the machine, but the police have evidence that implicates matthew in the murder of melanie foster.
we have to find them, bree. We have to find them and get danielle back.
you let go of me right now!
what's going on here? - I am trying to leave, and these morons won't let me.
do you know that you can be arrested for kidnapping, for detaining someone?!
why do you need to leave?
because my daughter is in danger.
something happened at cheerleading camp.
okay, there's no camp. That was a fib on my part.
I found out that she ran away with a boy, and the boy is a murderer.
a murderer?
I can tell by your tone that you don't believe me.
Bree, let's talk about this in my office.
I don't have time for therapy, you quack!
now let me out of here! Let go of me! You idiot, let go of me!
you know that I committed myself voluntarily! You can't do this to me!
Bree, please, don't struggle.
if anything happens to my daughter, so help me, god...
we're only trying to help.
Mr. Young, you'll need to come up to the house to sign some legal documents.
what for?
Noah taylor's will called for an immediate transference of his entire estate to you upon his death.
so everything's mine?
that's correct.
Hi, dad.
so, did you have any luck with your grandfather?
Yeah, I talked to noah. He's not gonna give us the money.
damn it, zach! - Sorry?
go back and talk to him.
no, I-I don't think he's gonna change his mind.
terrific. Am I gonna see you tomorrow?
no, I-I can't come tomorrow.
what about monday?
uh, next week's bad for me, too. I'll--I'll call you when I know.
is there anything I can do?
Yeah, get me a new phone with a different number.
and fill in this stupid lake.
the new neighbor...
he's cute. - He's a bachelor.
became a hero.
in a crisis that brought Julie and Austin together, while Carlos and Gaby broke apart.
I had a career and a future, but I gave it all up for you, and what did I get in return?
the police assembled their pieces of evidence.
your phone number was written on her hand.
I can't help you.
no memory, huh? That's convenient.
Karen Mccluskey had always believed in helping others, whether they wanted her help or not.
what's all this?
you know how you never got around to painting your garage door?
well, it's done.
hope you like blue.
Baxter! You found him!
Yeah, and I got him neutered, too.
I figured you wouldn't want any more strays around here.
Karen! - Hi, Alberta.
I took these down for you since, you know, Christmas was six months ago.
Yes, Mrs. Mccluskey's helping hand was known throughout Wisteria lane.
but on this day, it was about to get slapped.
what the hell are you doing?
jeez, Edie, you scared me.
what are you doing here?
getting mike's house ready. He comes back from the hospital tomorrow.
since when do you have a key to his garage?
he gave me one... in case of an emergency.
don't lie to me, prune.
fine, I found it under his mat. Look, I'm not doing anything wrong.
I just come over once a week and start his mower so the engine doesn't get rusty.
and do you mow your lawn with it, too?
what's the big deal? I'm doing him a favor.
well, he doesn't need any favors from you.
I'm gonna go through Mike's house room by room, and if I find as much as one paper clip missing, I'm calling the cops.
funny you should talk about stuff that's missing.
I found those pictures of Mike and Susan you threw out.
pictures?
Oh, don't act for me.
I know that Mike's been having troubles with his memory.
my guess
you don't want him to remember how crazy he was about his old girlfriend.
I don't need to resort to deception to land a man.
Oh, Edie, I saved the pictures...
and I can show them to Mike anytime I like.
Yes, Karen Mccluskey believed in helping others...
where are you going with this?
which she felt gave her the right to help herself.
so remember to be polite...
each year as part of their fund-raising drive, the fairview adventure scouts would award a shiny new bike to whoever sold the most magazine subscriptions, and each scout would set out utterly convinced the prize would be hers.
that's the beauty of youth.
young girls believe anything is possible...
that is, until they grow up and get divorced.
Hi.
what if I told you there is a way you could help cldren while also reading your favorite magazines at a reduced price?
would you like to hear more?
sure, knock yourself out.
wise choice.
for the lady of the house, we offer.
I think you mean "vogue," sweetie.
you sure?
I should know. I was on the cover.
no way.
uh, way.
Oh, see that coat I'm wearing in this shot? That's genuine ocelot fur.
although the photographer was the real animal, if you know what I'm saying...
which I hope you don't.
and don't ever do drugs, okay?
being a model must be so amazing.
why did you stop?
well, I fell in love, got married and moved to the suburbs for the whole fairy-tale happy ending thing.
that was a crock.
so you going back to modeling?
no. No, no, no, no, no, no.
why not?
what else are you gonna do?
you're going back to modeling? This is so sudden.
well, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
I'm just gonna fly to New York, meet with my old agent and take it from there.
come on, you guys, this is exciting. Be happy for me.
Oh, we are. We're just gonna miss you, that's all.
well, now that my divorce is final, I need a reason to wake up in the morning.
I have this hole in my life that can't be filled by shopping.
that's right, I said it.
Oh, my gosh. Lynette.
I'll get the kids. They're dying to see you.
okay. - Hey.
Hey! Oh, my gosh!
you didn't have to do this!
Hello! - Hi!
you look great.
well, apparently, taking a .38 slug to the shoulder agrees with you.
Yeah, um, listen, about that... the kids don't know what happened.
they don't?
I thought they were little young to deal with their mother getting shot.
all I told them is kayla is staying with her grandmother, and I madeup a story about how I got hurt.
Hey, mom! - oh, here they are!
Hey! - Mommy!
Oh, this side. Hi!
Hello!
I can't believe you got in a fight with a hobo.
yeah...
well, let's see how well you do on a morphine drip.
mommy, come inside. We helped Mrs. Mccluskey make your favorite lunch.
fantastic! Lead the way I'm coming in.
hurry up. I'm hungry. let's go.
there she is! Hi, my little bunny!
Hey, why don't you go inside and get the party started?
I've gotta-- okay?
gotcha. - Hi, bunny. I'll be right there.
Hey.
Hey, Lynette! - Uh, yeah.
you're home. - Yeah.
how you doing? - I'm good.
I just...
how do I thank the man who saved my life?
Oh, no, no, no. You don't have to say anything.
I'm gonna make you a cake.
a cake? - Yeah.
I never make cakes. This is huge.
in that case...
Thanks.
Yeah, I'm gonna make you a cake.
Christmas carols? It's not even thanksgiving.
I'm starting my cards early this year.
it puts me in the mood to spread holiday cheer.
and with the pack of lies in this family newsletter, she spreads holiday denial.
Andrew, it's etiquette. Nobody wants to read the truth at christmas.
well said, darling.
honey, would you put on another CD? Something with sleigh bells.
Oh, by the way, Orson, I need, uh, your mother's address at the nursing home.
Oh, well, I appreciate the thought, darling, but you needn't send her a card.
Oh don't be silly. I'm sending one to the man who reads our gas meter.
I can certainly send one to your mother.
she's completely senile. She'll only try to dunk it in her coffee.
well, all the more reason to send her one.
let the nurses know that she has family at home who loves her and who could drop by at any minute and slap them with a lawsuit.
Bree, I hear what you're saying
Orson, what's the big deal? It's just an address.
fine. I'll get my book.
the home is somewhere over in Lakeview.
Lakeview? Oh, you gave me the impression that she was back east.
well, that's because, frankly, I wanted to avoid this conversation.
but if she's only 30 minutes away, why haven't you been visiting her?
okay, the truth is...
it-- it breaks my heart to see her now.
I want to remember her as she was.
but, Orson-- - bree,
I refuse to sit in a room that smells of disinfectant and lime jell-o, making small talk with a woman who doesn't remember me.
now let it go, damn it.
but by all means, do send a card.
the elves will tickle her.
well, shall we? - Wait.
Julie's gonna know we came home early from the restaurant to check up on her.
I don't want her to think I'm overprotective and clingy.
the girl was held hostage. It's only natural you're gonna be a little bit clingy.
Yeah, it's been a week. I'm getting on her nerves.
how about this? We came home early because we hated the restaurant.
the service was dreadful, and the lobster was inedible.
okay.
wait, if we hated the restaurant, then why are we bringing home food?
good point.
wait, wait, wait, wait! Are you kidding?!
that's lobster!
okay, I thought the restaurant was fantastic, and you were the fussy snob who was impossible to please.
why do I have to be the fussy snob?
because you're British.
fine, but I trust you'll make it up to me later by doing the things a gentleman expects when he's sprung for lobster.
I'm not getting any tonight, am I?
you're supposed to be having dinner!
it's my fault. I found the restaurant to be absolutely
Oh, let it go. We came home because I was worried about U, and with good reason.
you, put on your shirt and get out.
well, I-I didn't bring a shirt.
see, I was out running and-- - who cares?! Go!
how could you treat him like that?
if Austin hadn't been in that supermarket, I might not be here.
Yes, and I am grateful, but I found a way to say "thank you" without taking my top off.
a couple of buttons came undone. It's not like my boobs were out.
okay, well, it's, uh, it's getting late and-- and I really
no, Ian, am I overreacting here?
well, I can understand on the heels of a crisis, two people might bondand find themselves...
you're a very naughty girl!
Julie, that boy drinks, he steals, and now I find him mauling you on my couch? That's it.
I forbid you to see him.
you can't do that. I choose who I date.
yeah? Well, I choose to ground you. Two weeks, baby.
fine, I'll just see him at school.
well, then you won't go to school. I'll homeschool you.
right, you're gonna teach me trig? You can't even balance your own checkbook.
Yes, and you will be poorly educated, and you won't get into college, and you will work for minimum wage for the rest of your life, all because of that boy!
I hope you're happy!
mom, I like this guy, and I'm sorry if it makes you unhappy, but I'm going to keep seeing him.
doesn't the place look great?
I came in and straightened up. I wanted everything to look nice for you.
you okay?
Yeah. Yeah, it's just that...
I'm home, but it doesn't really feel like home.
it will. Give it time.
the important thing is that you're back from the hospital, and every day you're getting better.
Hey, the worst is behind you.
I need the Delfino search warrant.
we're not gonna get it without proble cause.
the guy's phone number was written on a dead girl's hand.
the judge is gonna need more.
I thought you might say that. Here's Monique Polier's lab work.
the infrared spectroscopy matched paint fragnts in the head wound to the proximo line of pipe wrenches.
they're high-end, only used by professional plumbers, and guess what our boy Delfino does for a living?
I'll see what I can do.
what do you mean you can't shoot her?
Francesco, if you can airbrush her acne, you can airbrush the track marks.
now don't call me again unless she O D.S.
Gabrielle!
Oh, sit!
you look amazing, younger than ever!
it's my new dermal filler.
it's banned here, so my assistant smuggles it in from Brazil.
isn't it fun? I have my own drug mule.
that's great!
well, I have some fun news of my own.
I'm ready to model again. - Really?
the last time we spoke, you couldn't wait to quit.
you were giving it all up for love. What happened to prince charmi?
divorce.
Oh, single again?
isn't that ironic, since I'm the one you called
Oh, how did you put it?
a "career-obsessed lesbo who would die alone and be eaten by her cats."
did I say that?
water under the bridge. I thought it was funny.
it's even funnier now.
look, Marcella, I'm back, and we made such a great team before, and I think we can be again.
I don't know, darling. Things are different now.
you're not gonna be able to jump right back in where you left off.
well, I just wanna work.
boy, I'm still not sure.
you know what might help?
if you groveled.
are you serious?
well, I-I can't tell because your face doesn't move anymore.
no, I'm joking! Welcome back, darling!
Hi.
thank you.
well, hello there!
how pretty you look today!
it's wonderful that you're up and about!
you must be enjoying these colorful balloons!
why are you talking to me like I'm a moron?
Oh, I'm-- I'm so sorry.
the--the nurse pointed me over here. I'm--I'm looking for Gloria Hodge.
I'm Gloria Hodge.
who might you be?
well, I must say, I'm surprised at how lucid you are.
Orson led me to believe that I was in the final stages of Dementia?
no, I'm afraid that's just wishful thinking on his part.
well, how can he feel that way? You're his mother.
I wouldn't judge him too harshly.
ours is a... complicated relationship.
there is love, to be sure, but we have a way of disappointing each other.
well, how does he disappoint you?
he's cold, rigid...
and...
and utterly incapable of letting go of the past.
and how do you disappoint him?
I refuse to die.
Yes, I see. Well, surely this rift isn't irreparable.
do you know how people in nursing homes spend their days, Bree?
they think about the past and all the things they'd do differently if they had the chance.
please tell Orson that I'm sorry, and in spite of everything, I still love him.
well, I have a better idea. Why don't you tell him yourself?
that would be great. I really appreciate it.
okay. Thank you.
so what did Ed say? When do you have to go back to work?
he said take as much time as I want with pay.
you should get gunned down more often.
Hey, there they are! - Hey, guys!
how was school?
mommy, were you shot?
shot? Where did you hear that?
that's the same little creep who tried to ruin Santa Claus!
and he said that the same crazy lady that shot you killed auntie Nora dead.
it was on the news and everything.
okay, listen, kids. I am sorry.
we shouldn't have lied, but sometimes parents wanna protect the kids from scary things.
and look, the good news is, mommy's fine now. - Yeah.
and we'll all see auntie Nora again in heaven.
or wherever.
did they let you keep the bullet?
no, no, afraid not.
that blows. We wanted to bring it for show-and-tell.
Hey, sweetheart, you okay?
what if the crazy lady comes back?
she won't.
how do you know? - Come on.
well, because she's up in heaven with auntie nora.
or wherever.
Julie Mayer, you get back here!
you're grounded, remember?!
Edie Britt, I wanna talk to you.
I just survived a hostage situation.
haven't I suffered enough for one week?
you keep your nephew away from my daughter or else.
look, I don't like it either, but the harder we try to keep them apart, the more they're gonna fight to be together.
just let it run its course.
are you crazy?!
if we don't do something, those two could end up having sex!
"could"?
Oh, my god.
you don't-- - let me put it this way
I got a box of condoms in my dresser. 11 are gone.
can only account for eight of 'em.
how can you be so calm about this?
Edie? - Yeah?
can you help me with this tie? I...
Hey. - Mike...
you're out of the hospital.
Yeah. He's home.
in fact, we're gonna go out and celebrate tonight.
I'll be with you in one second, okay, babe?
Yeah.
since you asked, I'm calm because I know if two people are meant to be together, there's nothing anyone can do about it.
okay, I should be back at around 6: 00. They can have one snack.
try and push apples, but if they threaten violence,
I have an emergency candy bar under the sink.
not anymore you don't.
Oh, jeez.
mommy? Where are you going?
to the market. - No!
Hey, sweetie, it's a different market.
you're gonna get shot again. - No, I won't.
lots of mommies go to the store every day, and they're fine.
it's really not a scary place.
you went to the store, and you got shot, and auntie Nora died.
I'm only gonna be in there ten minutes, I promise.
can't she go?
fine. I'll go.
Thanks.
don't give a shoot if I get shot, do ya, kid?
you must be Tanya.
I'm Gabrielle. We're gonna be co-models today.
now I don't know if you've ever done one of these big shoots before, but don't be nervous.
durkin and I are old friends. He's a sweetheart.
now just remember, he's the king, do exactly what he says, and you'll be fine.
I've been modeling for two years,
I've done six magazine covers, and I'm sleeping with Durkin.
well, I guess you're all set then.
I've got some wardrobe choices.
I want to be buried in this dress!
this is for Tanya.
the "mom" stuff is at the end.
"mom"?
okay, love, let's get the blood pumping!
the concept is "lock up your daughters."
okay? Get to work, everybody.
Tanya, I want you to hover down here on the lawn, looking absolutely delicious.
thank you very much-- and up here on the porch, mom and dad looking all scandalized.
excuse me, Durkin?
Yes, love?
it's Gaby.
Gabrielle Marquez. You shot me in Milan, remember?
Yes! Yes!
lovely to see you again.
did you have a question then?
I do.
aren't you a little worried that I'm gonna pull focus?
I mean, it's a little confusing.
people are gonna see Tanya, and then they're gonna.
see that guy, and they're gonna wonder who I am.
you're the mum.
people aren't gonna buy that, so here's what I was thinking.
I slap on one of those gow,
I play Tanya's "big sister" home from college to raise a little hell.
and we're gonna cram all that on a subtitle, are we?
I'm sorry. Is just, this outfit is hideous!
just make it work.
fine. I just need a moment to get into character.
Gabrielle, what's the holdup?
we've got to get moving here.
ready, ready!
what's that?
Oh, I made it work. I'm "hot mom."
get me her agent.
before we begin, would either of you like some cookies, milk, lemonade, perhaps?
mom, why are we here?
Ah, cutting to the chase. I like it.
I have a confession to make.
this whole dating drama has been keeping me up at night, and I hate being the bitchy, naggy mom.
when it comes to parenting, I am much more comfortable playing the good cop.
do you see where I'm going with this, kids?
no
well, in that case.
meet the bad cop.
daddy!
Hey, baby girl.
that the guy?
Yep! Get him.
this is so unfair.
look, you defied my wishes, you broke my rules.
did you really think I was just gonna throw in the towel?
face it. I outsmarted you.
who's Ian? - What?
you're dating some British guy named Ian.
how did that come up?
I'm sorry. I didn't realize it was a big secret.
Hey, you know, when you said it was true love with you and the plumber,
I-I was a good guy.
I stepped aside, and now you're on to someone else.
big picture, Karl-- his hand up our daughter's shirt.
don't change the subject! - That is the subject!
how serious is it with this Ian guy?
I don't know! It's--it's complicated.
Yeah, he's kind of married.
he's what?
it's not what you think.
well, in her defense, his wife is in a coma.
all right, that--that's it!
all right, I forbid you to see this guy!
what?
No! I don't take orders from you!
mom has a point, dad.
you can't tell a woman who she can and can't date.
it's her choice. - Exactly. Thank you.
wait, no, that does not apply to you.
you know, if you don't care about my feelings, I don't know what I'm doing here.
your feelings?
my god, you are the worst bad cop ever!
go to your room.
not you!
get back here! You're under arrest!
no, I'm not!
Hey, buddy, you've been reading comic books for a while.
don't you wanna go and play?
no, I-I wanna stay with you.
yeah? Okay.
Hey, Art.
Oh, hey! How are ya? - Good.
listen, as if saving my life wasn't enough, I have a little favor to ask.
sure. What's up?
my kids are having a hard time.
they're pretty freaked out by that whole supermarket thing.
you're my hostage!
keep moving, or I'll blow your face off!
okay, it's my turn. Give me the gun.
not so much them. - right.
but my other son, Parker.
so. Back to the favor.
Hey, Parker, I want you to meet our new neighbor, Art.
he lives in the house ross the street.
his sister has the cool wheelchair with the joystick.
hey there, Parker.
Hi.
in the daytime, Art coaches swimming at the REC center, but.
please, I can tell Parker? Please?
and compromise my secret identity? No way, Mrs. Scavo. No way.
secret identity?
Oh, great, now the cat's out of the bag.
Oh, might as well tell him.
it's okay. You can trust him, really.
art is the one who saved me at the supermarket.
he's sort of a superhero.
give me a break.
it's true.
all right, if you're a superhero, what's your name?
I'm "protector man,"
because I protect people from bad guys.
you don't believe me, do you?
okay.
I really shouldn't do this, but.
did you really save my mom?
I really did.
he really did.
that's why you don't have to worry.
that's protector man's job.
your job is to run and play and have fun.
okay?
okay. - Okay.
Oh, my cousin went to Purdue.
what the hell?
nice to see you up and about.
here's our search warrant.
search warrant? Let me see that.
how we doing?
we couldn't find a toolbox.
the man's a plumber. Keep looking.
sir, I can't find a thing.
you tired?
you, come with me.
Marcella, look, I don't know what they told you, but all I'm asking for is a simple costume change.
you don't get to pull Diva Crap.
Tanya gets away with it because she's a star.
you are nothing.
where do you get off talking to me like that?
I shot 36 covers by the time I was 20!
well, you're 30 now.
when you make that face, you look 35.
do you know how many photographers would die to work with me again?
Yeah. Zero.
I had to call in major favors just to get you this job.
I don't believe that.
well, you know what I don't believe?
you gave up a brilliant career to play house in the suburbs, and the minute it falls apart, you come back here expecting a homecoming parade.
well, guess what, sweetie?
we've moved on.
now get your polyester ass over there and act like the pro you used to be.
beautiful, Tanya. That's it. Chin up.
fantastic!
mother, hold the plate higher.
beautiful, Tanya. Oh, you are gorgeous!
Yes, girl! Lovely, lovely!
Hiya, Mike. Welcome home. You remember me?
Yeah, I-I think so.
the--the corner house with all the gnomes out front?
you're thinking of Martha Huber.
terrible story.
someone beat her to death, and then buried her in the forest.
ironic, huh?
isn't that where gnomes live?
I don't really know that much about gnomes.
anyway, I know the cops were here earlier.
so?
well, you won't remember this, but one night two years ago, you drove me to the hospital after I had an attack of angina.
probably saved my life.
anyway, I figure I owe ya. Here.
you might wann wash that wrench off.
it's got something on it.
sorry I'm late. Mrs. Prescott broke a crown and.
Orson, how well you look.
Hello, mother.
a word, darling?
I can't believe you did this!
and I can't believe you told me that she was senile! You lied to me.
Yes, to spare us the misery of her company. You don't know her, Bree.
she's a loathsome woman, and I refuse to break bread with her.
now you listen to me. That woman gave you life, and the fifth commandment tells us to honor our parents no matter how hideous or repellent they may be.
that's not exactly what- - Orson, it's implied!
now get out there and show her some respect!
fine, but if you expect anything more from me than forced civility, you will be deeply disappointed.
Bree, this salmon is superb.
well, thank you!
it did win me the blue ribbon at the gourmet county cookoff.
I just love the sauce.
what gives it that kick?
you'd never ask a magician how a trick is done.
you've barely touched your salmon, dear.
is everything okay?
Yes.
I was just wondering why you're here.
I want us to be friends.
okay, let's suppose I just had a massive head injury and believe you.
we're pals. Now what do you want?
Orson, why does she have to have an ulterior motive?
I want out of that home.
Ah, there it is.
it's a hellhole! Besides, I'm perfectly healthy now.
my hip is better, I can handle the stairs, and you said when I got strong enough I'd get to go back to my house.
Oh, here's the thing-- I sold it.
what?
you heard me.
what about my things?
all gone. Oh, I also sold the car.
see, that's the thing about hellholes.
they don't pay for themselves.
how dare you? You had no right!
okay! Maybe I will share my secret ingredient.
I should have smothered you in your crib when I have the chance.
paprika! There, it's out!
that's the mother I remember!
I was wondering when she'd show up.
Yes, Orson, I am your mother, so you more than anyone should know how I deal with betrayal.
so. Can we call her grandma?
I've got one more load, and then I'm gonna do my homework.
do you have anything you want me to throw in?
no, I'm good. Thanks.
mom, listen.
I know I've put you through the wringer lately, and I'm sorry.
16 years of being perfect.
you were due.
that's what I don't get.
you've always trusted my judgment.
why can't you trust me about Austin?
relationships have nothing to do with good judgment.
it doesn't matter how smart you are.
you can still get hurt.
you do your homework. I'm gonna finish the laundry.
okay.
there you go, Mrs. H.
all right.
can I use your bathroom, just. - Come on in.
please, stay for dessert.
I'll work on Orson, and we'll discuss this together.
you saw what he sentenced me to a room no better than a furnished coffin.
I have nothing to say to him.
well, then talk to me.
I know you're upset, but don't shut me out. Please.
please, Gloria, let me in.
well, I. I didn't mean it literally, but okay.
we'll, um, we'll sit together. and we'll talk.
what are you doing?
I'm not going back to that place.
Gloria, stop!
let's get my mother back to the home, shall we?
not that it's any of my business, but, is everything okay with you folks?
Oh, yeah, there was a little tension earlier, but I think it's all been resolved.
Oh, what the hell?
no, I absolutely forbid it!
just for a few weeks till we find a place where she'll be happier.
you should've heard her in the car.
she's absolutely miserable in that nursing home.
I don't care.
my mother's not moving in here till she fits in a jar on the mantle.
how can you be so cold?
you don't know who she is.
I've worked my entire life to get away from that woman.
Why?
what could she possibly have done to make you hate her so much?
look, there is nothing to be gained by dredging up the past.
Orson, if there's something I should know.
could I speak to my son a moment?
of course.
so you know, I've decided to accept your wife's kind invitation.
I won't allow it.
Oh, I think you will.
we're going to end our quarrel right now, or I'll tell your wife what it's about.
you wouldn't.
just try me.
I gave you life.
you know I won't hesitate to take it away.
now give mother a kiss.
why in the hell would I wanna do that?
Hey, you're back!
I'd give you a hug, but I'm really sweaty.
so how was New York? - Oh, it was fine.
Bree said you got a job on the first day.
you're such a star! I want details.
you know, just hours and hours of sitting around, looking pretty.
but I think I'm done with modeling.
so you're not gonna move to New York?
well, if something great comes up, I-I might fly out, but I'm pretty settled here.
Oh, thank god!
we were all so worried we were losing you.
okay, now I'm hugging you.
Oh, it's amazing. Your life is such an adventure.
can't wait to see what you do next.
Yeah, me, too.
okay.
Mr. Protector man?
that's a secret. Hello?
Hello?
Ah, sweet!
mom, look!
Hey, don't touch anything.
I'm just gonna write a note, and then we'll go.
okay.
Parker? Hey!
come back here!
honey? Come on, we're leaving.
Parker, come on, we're leaving.
why didn't you come when I called?
superhero houses are great!
Parker, come on, we're gonna get out of there.
Why? - Oh, I just say so.
come on.
there are so many things we wish we could tell the young.
we'd like to persuade them not to grow up so fast, but they won't listen.
we want to tell them that beauty fades.
but they refuse to believe it.
we warn them that their actions will have consequences, but still they defy us.
sadly, the young can't begin to understand the world is a dangerous place.
so it's up to us to do anything we can to protect them.
what if I told you there is a way you could help children.
absolutely anything.
superhero houses are great!
turned out to be anything but.
Orson's mother took up residence...
I've decided to accept your wife's kind invitation.
you wouldn't.
and Mike couldn't remember...
no memory, huh?
that's convenient.
anything at all.
here's our search warrant.
we couldn't find a toolbox.
Oh, you might want to wash that wrench off.
it's got something on it.
I'm just saying that we never spend the night at your house.
but your place is so warm and cozy.
Oh, it's also a disaster area. I didn't get a chance to clean it today.
oops!
Oh, here, let me.
Susan Mayer had never thought of herself as Cinderella, but then one day...
a prince showed up...
well, we can't have you sleeping in squalor, can we?
my place it is.
and Susan realized her life had become a fairy tale, and since her prince had welcomed her into his castle, she felt the least she could do was thank him...
again...
and again...
and again.
the next morning, however, Susan discovered castles...
don't run themselves.
all right, oh...
but let's make it a quickie 'cause you are wasting water.
Aah!
sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.
uh, who are you?
I am Rupert.
I work for Mr. Hainsworth.
that would be the man you slept with, in case names weren't exchanged.
Oh, no, I-I'm your boss' girlfriend.
surely he mentioned me.
not that I recollect.
good morning, boss.
I thought you were off today.
isn't-- isn't your sister in town?
uh, that's next weekend, Sir.
it's a good thing, too.
otherwise, I might not have had the pleasure of meeting your...girlfriend.
Yes, we met at the, um, at the hospital.
why don't I fetch you a robe?
loving that idea.
would you care for some breakfast?
omelette? Strawberry tart? Brioche?
um, yeah, that-- that sounds great.
um, you pick.
Yes, Susan's life had indeed become a fairy tale...
you are aware there is a Mrs. Hainsworth?
well, of course.
and what's a fairy tale...
tart it is.
without a dragon to slay?
we know dangerous men walk among us.
what we can't be sure of is who they are or where they hide.
so the most we can offer any stranger is reasonable doubt.
but once the doubt is gone, people are anything but reasonable.
I am telling you, our neighbor is a pedophile, and I expect you to do something about it.
Mrs. Scavo, he's not listed on any sex offender registry.
he's never had so much as a traffic ticket.
he's a single man with a basement full of toys!
I understand your concern, but we can't book a guy on possession of toys.
you don't get it. His house had this creepy vibe.
tell him, Tom.
I never went down to the actual room
okay, he wasn't there. He doesn't know.
look, he had a wall full of pictures of half-naked boys in swimsuits.
didn't you say he was a swim coach?
what are you, his lawyer?
you have to admit, it's odd.
here's what's odd
if your neighbor had something to hide, why'd he invite you in to see all of his stuff?
he wasn't technically home when I went inside.
so you broke in?
the door was open...
I was bringing him a cake.
a cake?
it was a "thank you" cake.
he sort of saved my life.
she didn't know that he was a pedophile when she baked the actual cake
he doesn't care about the cake, Tom.
well, why are you snapping at me? - You're totally snapping.
I'm not snapping at you.
I am snapping because there is a monster across the street, and Barney Fife here is making me sound like the bad guy!
look, I'm sorry.
she's been under a lot of stress, hasn't slept well.
you better not be apologizing for me!
gotta go.
so... I've got some fabulous news.
well, I hope it's more fabulous than this dress.
you're gonna have to find yourself another personal shopper.
what, I slam one dress, and you quit on me?
no, that's my news.
I'm leaving the store and starting my own business.
"beauty by Vern"?
you're opening up a salon? God, could you get any gayer?
it's a consulting firm for beauty pageant contestants.
and the answer's yes.
this week, I'm coaching little girls for the Miss Snowflake Pageant.
it's very rewarding.
Hey, you know what might be fun?
if you come down and give a talk. You know, give the kids some pointers.
Vern, I worked the catwalks in Milan and Paris.
I'm not gonna give makeup tips to little Miss Training Bra.
you have been in rare bitch form.
it's been months now, so don't blame it on your cycle.
don't call me a bitch, and stop tracking my cycle.
I told you that freaks me out.
I'm just saying you've been very cranky today.
what's going on?
the divorce decree came through today.
Carlos is officially out of my life.
Oh, honey.
the girls' ages range 8 to 12.
we meet every thursday in the rec room of the Elks Lodge.
I'm not doing it.
you need a project. That's your problem, you're bored.
and you know what the cure for that is
helping others.
fine. I'll do it, but I want this dress for free.
evil! You said you hated it.
and I hate helping others, too, but I'm doing that, aren't I?
is the coast clear? I don't wanna flash the help again.
relax. He's making breakfast, but you're more than welcome to flash me.
how long has Rupert worked for you?
Oh, for years. He's practically family.
so you're that close, and you never told him about me?
Yes, about that...
rupert was incredibly devoted to Jane.
he's, uh, never seen me with another woman, let alone a frisky, naked one.
well, that explains why he was a little cold to me this morning.
was he? I'll have a talk with him.
Oh, no, don't do that. That'll just make it wor.
I get it. He loved Jane. He doesn't know me.
you know, I'll just have to charm him, warm him up a little.
well, I'm, uh, I'm sure you'll find a way.
great. 9:00 in the morning, and I have to put on a slinky, black cocktail dress.
Hey, here's an idea.
you keep some things in a drawer at my house.
would it be okay if I had one here?
a drawer? Do you think we'll be here that often?
your shower has six power nozzles. With or without you, I'll be back.
well, then by all means, let's get you a drawer.
I don't need much. One of those will do.
actually, that's not a good idea. Rupert arranges things meticulously.
you'll never win him over if you mess with his system.
your timing's perfect.
not always.
Susan will be needing a drawer.
a drawer, Sir?
Yes, for her things. She's gonna be spending more time here.
Yeah, rupe, I hope we can be good friends, 'cause you're gonna be seeing lots more of me.
Oh, madam, that hardly seems possible.
mother hodge, your food will get cold!
why, please, is there a lock on the liquor cabinet?
because your doctor says people taking your medication shouldn't drink, a warning you've chosen to ignore if the lipstick on the vodka bottle is any indication.
poached fish again? I don't want this.
I want what you're all having.
well, your doctor has you on a low fat, low sodium diet.
eight meals this week, eight times I've told you the same thing.
so... who would like to say grace?
allow me.
dear lord, I thank you for this bland, indifferently prepared meal and beseech you to ignite some spark of compassion in my coldhearted daughter-in-law, that she might show some shred of mercy to me, her wretched captive.
Amen.
mother, may I remind you, you asked to come here?
I didn't know I'd be trading one jail for another.
at least at the home you could bribe the orderlies to smuggle things in, but here, nothing gets past the commandant.
I have done everything I can to make you happy and comfortable.
what do you want from us?
I want my freedom.
I want out of this perky little gulag and into a house I can call my own, and you're going to buy it for me.
I can't afford to buy you a house.
you can't afford not to.
I know a house won't be easy to swing, but how many more of these Edward Albee dinners do you want to sit through?
what did she mean by "you can't afford not to"?
was she threatening you with something?
Yes, she's threatening to make us miserable till we cave.
look, at least see if Edie has any cheap listings.
we'll be happier, my mother will be happier
Yeah, and she'll take terrible care of herself and be dead in a year.
you just stole my next argument.
okay, you've got enough money to pay either the phone or the cable bill, but not both.
Hello?
I'm trying to help you here.
Oh, I'm sorry. Just do whatever you want.
fine. Cable it is.
nobody calls you anyway.
what do you want?
my toilet's clogged.
I thought maybe you could fix it.
Oh, wait, you can't, can you?
cause you don't have any tools.
must be tough being a plumber without tools.
why don't you people leave me the hell alone?
jeez, you sure are hostile for a guy who makes his living in the service industry.
you know, it just occurred to me, there's no point in paying the cable bill if you're not gonna have electricity, so I'm thinking pay the electricity upfront and...
where have you been? They're all waiting for you.
I'm here to teach fashion, so I'm fashionably late.
cute. Now remember, these mothers have refinanced trailers in order to pay for this, so when you make your entrance, for god sakes, sparkle.
now in addition to her three "Vogue" covers, you may remember her as the face of La Roque cosmetics.
please welcome Miss Gabrielle Marquez!
Vern? A moment.
is there a problem? - Yes!
what am I supposed to do with that petting zoo out there?
not everyone wins the genetic lottery like you did.
these girls need help finding the promised land of beauty and style.
please, Gabrielle, be their Moses.
good comparison, because it's gonna take a miracle to turn these mutts into show dogs.
Hey. girls, let's talk beauty.
what's up, brother?
I'm sorry. You are...
Carlos from down the street.
we were only best friends, dude.
Oh, um, well, things have been a little fuzzy since the accident.
I'm sorry that I, uh, I hadn't come by sooner, but my divorce has been kicking my ass.
I'm sorry to hear that.
anyway, I got a new condo, but it's getting renovated, so I was thinking maybe I could crash here.
here?
Yeah, I could help you out around the house and free you up to focus on job one
getting better.
cause you're tossing it to Edie now, right?
that's a real relationship killer, needing your lady to hoist you off the can.
well, how long are we talking?
couple months. Three at the most.
and, of course, I can kick in for half the utilities and rent.
well, how can I say no to my best friend?
what are the Blake kids doing all the way over here?
Pam needs to keep a closer eye on them.
will you please come away from that window? You barely slept last night.
come on. Take a nap.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
hold on.
Hey, what's up?
I've been meaning to get this back to you and to thank you.
Rebecca and I really enjoyed the cake.
Oh! Good.
so...
Bye.
so what'd you think of our place?
sorry?
I heard you were good friends with the young family.
it must have been weird being in there with all the new furniture.
I-I didn't notice.
well, how about the kitchen?
Rebecca likes the color, but I'm not so sure.
Oh, sorry. Never made it past the living room.
what? ! come on!
you're in an empty house, curious about your new neighbors...
you look around. We all do it.
well, I don't.
well, next time you're over, I'll have to give you the tour.
great, great.
Mr. Protector man! - Hey, hey. Not now, Parker.
I just wanted to see if I can play his pinball machine again.
I guess there's no need for that tour.
all right, girls, first things first, if you can't walk, you can't win.
hit it, Vern!
remember, eyes forward, shoulders back, hips square.
look left, look right, whip and walk.
Yes, I'm unbelievable. Close your mouths.
uh, okay, stop, stop.
what?
my eyes were forward, my hips were square.
but where's your confidence? Where's your pride?
come on. What do I have to be proud of?
have you guys ever seen a runway model without the hot clothes and makeup?
well, trust me, they're not that special, but the one thing that they do have is attitude.
you have to believe in yourself, and if not, pretend to believe in yourself, okay?
all right.
now I want you to pretend you're on the runway...
flashbulbs are popping, everyone's looking at you, envying you, and they're all thinking the same thing
Isabel Horowitz is smoking hot!
go, Isabel! Go!
you're doing it! Isabel, you're doing it!
that's it! Keep going!
I was walking! - Oh! You
you were totally walking! Good job!
all right, Donna, you're next.
get up there and make me hate your beauty.
now this place is a real diamond in the rough.
cozy little 2-bedroom plus den, with a highly motivated seller.
Oh, look, a highly motivated cockroach.
Oh!
let's try to be positive, people.
it's a fabulous location.
just walking distance to all sorts of fun shops.
right! From here I can see a bail bondsman and an adult bookshop.
what do you expect in your price range, "Tara"?
let's go. Thank you.
wait.
I'm not an impractical woman.
I know that my son's resources are like his achievements... rather limited.
I want to see the rest of it.
okay.
now the lighting in the kitchen is a bit harsh. The previous owner
well, let's just say he ran some sort of home-based medical business.
you cannot let your mother move into this neighborhood.
it's filled with junkies and whores.
Yeah, and we'll owe them all an apology, but who cares? She likes it.
of course she likes it.
there's a 24-hour liquor store across the street.
look, she wants a house. This is the best we can afford without bankrupting ourselves.
Orson, what if something should happen to her?
stop worrying about her. Worry about us.
do you realize how much we've been fighting since she came?
the woman's ruined every relationship that's mattered to me, and she's doing it again.
Oh, my god!
are you all right? - Mother? Mother?
it's just a little spill. Her cane hit a loose tile.
is anything broken?
well, obviously, the damn floor.
we'll need that fixed before she moves in.
are you insane? She obviously can't be on her own.
why, it's a loose tile.
I'm perfectly fine.
and what if you weren't?
what if she had broken something and she was lying here for hours?
you are coming home with us.
Bree- and I will not hear another word on the subject.
I can't believe you bought us pizza.
well, you guys earned it.
but eat fast, because we only have one hour left, and I want to introduce you to your new best friend
Mr. Spray Tan.
you know so much cool stuff.
can't you come back another day?
Oh, I don't know.
please? - You have to.
well, let me check my book.
I might have to move some stuff around, but I think I can swing it.
your life must be so exciting, huh?
Yeah, every day's a parade.
so what was it like being a famous model?
honestly, it was like any other job, except the pay was great, the clothes were couture and the parties were just this side of Gomorrah.
you don't know what "Gomorrah" means, do you?
good.
did you know Kate Moss?
I invited her to a party once.
did you eat pizza with her?
cause if you did, it's almost like we ate pizza with her.
well, honey, most models don't eat pizza.
well, at least not without having a finger for dessert.
gross.
I know. I never did that.
you would not believe the horrible things these girls did to stay skinny.
like what?
well, some would smoke those unfiltered french cigarettes.
but cigarettes can kill you.
but before they do, they kill your appetite.
one time, there was a girl who took too many laxatives, and, uh...
well, if you're ever at the chateau Milan in room 238, do not use the jacuzzi.
do you have to be skinny to be a model?
well, yeah. When's the last time you saw a fat person on a magazine cover?
now I'm gonna go talk to Vern about our next session.
you guys finish lunch so we can get back to work.
Hi, Rupert!
I went to the mall and bought a change of clothes for the weekend, and while I was there, I got something for you.
I thought you could wear it on your day off.
do you like it?
very much.
it'll come in handy should my nationality ever slip my mind.
that was good.
you... I wanna party with you.
Hey. I was thinking this afternoon maybe we could go look for that drawer.
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm afraid I have all this silver to polish.
well, let me help you, and we can talk.
there is so much I wanna know about you.
who is Rupert Cavanaugh?
what makes him tick?
tell you what
let's go find you that drawer, hmm?
Oh, isn't the master bedroom down that way?
I realize it's a bit of a jaunt, but I managed to find you an entire bureau.
okay, well, you certainly didn't have to go to all that trouble.
is there a problem?
uh, no, I-I-I just, well, all I really needed was just a little...
little drawer, and, uh, this is just so far away
and what is that smell?
Oh, yes, about that
the cat passed away in this room.
did you consider removing the body?
well, if this isn't acceptable,
I can look elsewhere for a drawer when I have the time.
why do you have to be this way?
what way is that?
listen, I know how you feel about Jane, but if you could just give me a chance...
I mean, come on, you... you can't possibly hate me this much, can you?
I'm done. Oh, fine. Fine, fine...
I don't need you to like me, but I think you should give me just a little respect.
I am Ian's girlfriend.
he's still married.
at best, you're his mistress.
okay, you are not allowed to call me that.
fine.
what term would you prefer?
concubine?
consort?
gold-digging whore?
I'm so sorry. I'm
I-I-I shouldn't have done that.
but, rupert, you have to admit, it's just a drawer.
those drawers are filled with Jane's things.
this is her house.
you are a guest in her house, and a temporary one at best.
okay, you know, that is for Ian to decide.
Oh, he has decided.
why do you think he never told me about you?
why did he wait so long to bring you here?
he didn't want you in that room, where he still keeps Jane's things exactly as she left them.
but... I'll keep looking for that drawer.
Hey. I'm going over to Mike's.
I thought you were gonna mow the lawn.
I know.
it's just that I promised I'd help him install a shower bar, and, um, it could take a while.
okay.
T-Rex.
how they hanging, brother?
low and lazy.
Hey, if Lynette asks,
I installed your shower bar today.
you got it.
Vern, what are you doing here?
we need to talk. - Is it about the girls' makeup?
cause I got them each their own makeup kit, custom-tailored to match their skin tone.
and I got Melina some wax. I know she's only 11, but those greek genes are gonna kick in any day now.
what? - This morning, Mrs. Hayes caught Donna her finger down her throat trying to barf up her toaster waffle.
Really?
and Mrs. Horowitz found Isabel behind their garage smoking.
apparently, she thought cigarettes would help her lose a few pounds.
where do you think she got that idea?
those damn tobacco companies! - Gaby!
Oh, fine, I may have told a few stories about the old days, but as a warning.
I didn't say anything inappropriate for kids.
Cassie Warren asked her mother if she could throw a Gomorrah party.
okay, look, we have to do damage control. I get it.
next session, I'll apologize to all the moms.
there's not gonna be a next session for you.
the moms don't want you anywhere near their daughters.
but I'm helping them.
they love me!
wait, please, Vern, you have to give me a chance to fix this.
it's too late, Gaby.
you are now officially a bad influence.
well, see you at spin class.
mom said we couldn't leave.
I'm just going out front.
what the hell is that?
stop running the ball!
can I ask you guys something?
what was I like before the accident?
what do you mean?
I mean, what kind of guy was I? Was I happy? Was I angry?
did I ever get violent?
you were fine.
look, I'm serious.
I really need to know.
you... you can be honest. You're my best friend.
honestly?
you were sort of mysterious, kept to yourself.
nobody really knew you all that well.
and this is coming from your best friend.
I'm sorry, guys,
I just... I guess I was really tired.
uh, where's your brother?
he went outside. - Yeah.
what... okay, watch her!
watch her. I'll be back. I'll be right back.
Hello? Open up! Open the door!
Lynette? What's the matter?
I want my son.
he's not here.
he's not at our house, he's not in our yard.
do not jerk me around.
you can't just barge into my house like this Lynette.
don't play dumb with me.
I know exactly what is down here!
Where's the pinball? Where's all the games?
Oh, that was a collection I was taking up for the children's hospital.
I delivered everything yesterday.
did you donate the photos, too?
what exactly is it ？you're accusing me of?
don't pretend you don't know.
I'm calling the police. Parker!
is there a problem?
you're damn right, there's a problem. I can't find my son.
isn't that your son?
where have you been?
we were at mike's. He wandered over looking for me.
what... what's going on?
that was the children's hospital.
art's story checks out.
he donated all that stuff.
that proves nothing. He knew I was on to him. He had to dump it someplace.
honey, believe me, I am with you.
there is something fishy about this guy.
but you gotta get a grip.
you can't go barging into people's homes.
what if Parker had been in there? - But he wasn't, and if you keep accusing this guy whout proof, he can sue us.
listen...
I've been thinking that after everything that you have been through
please don't bring up the supermarket again.
that was a traumatic experience.
I think it's affected you more than you realize.
and maybe you need to talk to somebody about it...
you know, like a therast.
you're right.
I need to talk to someone.
he'd gotten rid of everything
the toys, the pictures, everything was gone.
you can't sit on this, Lynette.
I know!
if something happened to someone's kid because I kept my mouth shut...
the thing is, I promised Tom I'd back off.
well, I didn't.
Jane has some beautiful things.
Yes, she's always had impeccable taste.
I, um, I know how it must seem to you, my holding on to them.
but I-I just couldn't bring myself to
I get it.
as much as I have tried to pretend that it's just you and me...
there's three of us in this relationship.
Susan, you... you know I adore you.
no, please, listen...
the last couple of months,
I thought we've gotten really close, and I have been loving that.
um, I just feel like lately...
there's this limit to how far you'll let me in.
well, I'm... I'm trying.
it's just the, um, the more I-I let you into my heart, the more I feel I'm pushing Jane out and
you don't have to push Jane out to let me in.
of course. You're right.
do you know what I think? - No.
that kind of compassionate wisdom deserves an obscenely expensive meal.
okay, well, give me a minute, and I will change into something nice.
uh, Rupert still hasn't found you a drawer?
no, not just yet.
well, in that case...
Ian, you don't have to do that.
if I can make room in my heart for both of you,
I can certainly make room in my bureau.
it's just not right. Your mother skipped lunch, too.
she said she wasn't hungry.
can't we just revel in her absence?
I know she's a handful, but she deserves some compassion.
the woman watched a dream die yesterday.
we all did.
I'm taking her dinner up.
Oh, that's okay. I'll do it.
no, I'd rather do it myself.
I wanna talk to her.
Oh, well, I'll let her know you're coming.
mom's coming. Ditch the wine.
very well.
you finished the whole bottle already?
I was... thirsty.
Gloria, I've been thinking and
does no one in this house ever bother to knock?
is that alcohol?
where did you get that?
when my grandma asks me a favor with tears in her eyes, how
Oh, shut up, you little extortionist.
he charged me 20 bucks, plus 5 for the corkscrew.
I'll deal with you later.
you can kiss that codeine good-bye.
andrew brought her wine.
Oh, for god's sake.
this is our house.
if you expect to stay here, you're going to learn to obey a few rules.
I don't obey rules. I make them.
not anymore, mother.
just watch yourself, sunny boy.
okay, look, I know you're upset, but don't blame Orson. It's not his fault.
it's all his fault.
you think he's so wonderful.
you don't know the half of what he's done.
let's go.
I can't deal with her when she's like this.
he doesn't want you to hear the truth
how he cheated on Alma.
what?
she's drunk!
how he broke her heart... and mine, all for his precious Monique.
you shut up, mother.
I thought that was Harvey Bigsby's mistress.
Oh, she got around, that girl!
see, I told you. I told you she would do this.
there he was, cheating on Alma, not knowing all the time this whore was cheating on him.
stop it!
you shut your evil mouth!
or what?
what are you gonna do to me that hasn't already been done?
Bree! no!
Bree, wait!
I know. I thought it was so adorable.
miss Gabrielle! - Gabrielle!
what is she doing here?
I have no idea.
I told her she was banned.
okay, just give me a minute.
I'm sorry about what I said to the girls, and it won't happen again.
damn right. You're not going anywhere near our girls.
can't you give me a second chance?
why should we?
Yeah, I mean, you walk in here all clickety-clack, perfect little miss size zero, thinking you're all better than us.
we all saw the look on your face when you showed up.
I don't think I'm better than you.
hell, I envy you.
please.
no, it's true.
you have husbands and famils and a reason to wake up in the morning.
what do I have?
him.
teaching your kids about confidence and beauty is the most useful thing I've done since...
I don't know when.
and as much as I've helped them...
they've helped me so much more.
so please, I need this.
and I promise, no more talk about dodgy weight loss methods.
like the highly effective, non-FDA-approved diet pill I can get from my friends in Zurich...
in bulk.
well, I suppose the christian thing would be to forgive her.
well, why don't you ladies talk it over?
and I'm gonna work on posture with the girls.
Yeah! Come on!
Oh, thank god.
I've been driving around all night looking for you.
we saw that woman at the morgue on our wedding night.
you pretended not to know her.
Bree, I can explain.
no. I'm done.
you don't understand what happened.
there were two women in your life before me.
one vanished, and the other was killed.
that's all I need to understand.
I've packed some of your things.
I want you out of the house.
now.
please...
I love you.
I know...
but it scares the hell out of me.
dangerous men walk among us, and we can't always be sure of who they are or what secrets they hide.
but once our worst suspicions are confirmed, we can take action.
once their agendas are revealed...
we can take steps to protect ourselves and those we love.
Yes, dangerous men can cause great harm.
but sometimes the greatest danger they pose...
I'll take those.
is to themselves.
superhero houses are great!
turned out to be anything but.
Orson's mother took up residence...
I've decided to accept your wife's kind invitation.
you wouldn't.
and Mike couldn't remember...
no memory, huh?
that's convenient.
anything at all.
here's our search warrant.
we couldn't find a toolbox.
Oh, you might want to wash that wrench off.
it's got something on it.
I'm just saying that we never spend the night at your house.
but your place is so warm and cozy.
Oh, it's also a disaster area. I didn't get a chance to clean it today.
oops!
Oh, here, let me.
Susan Mayer had never thought of herself as Cinderella, but then one day...
a prince showed up...
well, we can't have you sleeping in squalor, can we?
my place it is.
and Susan realized her life had become a fairy tale, and since her prince had welcomed her into his castle, she felt the least she could do was thank him...
again...
and again...
and again.
the next morning, however, Susan discovered castles...
don't run themselves.
all right, oh...
but let's make it a quickie 'cause you are wasting water.
Aah!
sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.
uh, who are you?
I am Rupert.
I work for Mr. Hainsworth.
that would be the man you slept with, in case names weren't exchanged.
Oh, no, I-I'm your boss' girlfriend.
surely he mentioned me.
not that I recollect.
good morning, boss.
I thought you were off today.
isn't-- isn't your sister in town?
uh, that's next weekend, Sir.
it's a good thing, too.
otherwise, I might not have had the pleasure of meeting your...girlfriend.
Yes, we met at the, um, at the hospital.
why don't I fetch you a robe?
loving that idea.
would you care for some breakfast?
omelette? Strawberry tart? Brioche?
um, yeah, that-- that sounds great.
um, you pick.
Yes, Susan's life had indeed become a fairy tale...
you are aware there is a Mrs. Hainsworth?
well, of course.
and what's a fairy tale...
tart it is.
without a dragon to slay?
we know dangerous men walk among us.
what we can't be sure of is who they are or where they hide.
so the most we can offer any stranger is reasonable doubt.
but once the doubt is gone, people are anything but reasonable.
I am telling you, our neighbor is a pedophile, and I expect you to do something about it.
Mrs. Scavo, he's not listed on any sex offender registry.
he's never had so much as a traffic ticket.
he's a single man with a basement full of toys!
I understand your concern, but we can't book a guy on possession of toys.
you don't get it. His house had this creepy vibe.
tell him, Tom.
I never went down to the actual room
okay, he wasn't there. He doesn't know.
look, he had a wall full of pictures of half-naked boys in swimsuits.
didn't you say he was a swim coach?
what are you, his lawyer?
you have to admit, it's odd.
here's what's odd
if your neighbor had something to hide, why'd he invite you in to see all of his stuff?
he wasn't technically home when I went inside.
so you broke in?
the door was open...
I was bringing him a cake.
a cake?
it was a "thank you" cake.
he sort of saved my life.
she didn't know that he was a pedophile when she baked the actual cake
he doesn't care about the cake, Tom.
well, why are you snapping at me? - You're totally snapping.
I'm not snapping at you.
I am snapping because there is a monster across the street, and Barney Fife here is making me sound like the bad guy!
look, I'm sorry.
she's been under a lot of stress, hasn't slept well.
you better not be apologizing for me!
gotta go.
so... I've got some fabulous news.
well, I hope it's more fabulous than this dress.
you're gonna have to find yourself another personal shopper.
what, I slam one dress, and you quit on me?
no, that's my news.
I'm leaving the store and starting my own business.
"beauty by Vern"?
you're opening up a salon? God, could you get any gayer?
it's a consulting firm for beauty pageant contestants.
and the answer's yes.
this week, I'm coaching little girls for the Miss Snowflake Pageant.
it's very rewarding.
Hey, you know what might be fun?
if you come down and give a talk. You know, give the kids some pointers.
Vern, I worked the catwalks in Milan and Paris.
I'm not gonna give makeup tips to little Miss Training Bra.
you have been in rare bitch form.
it's been months now, so don't blame it on your cycle.
don't call me a bitch, and stop tracking my cycle.
I told you that freaks me out.
I'm just saying you've been very cranky today.
what's going on?
the divorce decree came through today.
Carlos is officially out of my life.
Oh, honey.
the girls' ages range 8 to 12.
we meet every thursday in the rec room of the Elks Lodge.
I'm not doing it.
you need a project. That's your problem, you're bored.
and you know what the cure for that is
helping others.
fine. I'll do it, but I want this dress for free.
evil! You said you hated it.
and I hate helping others, too, but I'm doing that, aren't I?
is the coast clear? I don't wanna flash the help again.
relax. He's making breakfast, but you're more than welcome to flash me.
how long has Rupert worked for you?
Oh, for years. He's practically family.
so you're that close, and you never told him about me?
Yes, about that...
rupert was incredibly devoted to Jane.
he's, uh, never seen me with another woman, let alone a frisky, naked one.
well, that explains why he was a little cold to me this morning.
was he? I'll have a talk with him.
Oh, no, don't do that. That'll just make it wor.
I get it. He loved Jane. He doesn't know me.
you know, I'll just have to charm him, warm him up a little.
well, I'm, uh, I'm sure you'll find a way.
great. 9:00 in the morning, and I have to put on a slinky, black cocktail dress.
Hey, here's an idea.
you keep some things in a drawer at my house.
would it be okay if I had one here?
a drawer? Do you think we'll be here that often?
your shower has six power nozzles. With or without you, I'll be back.
well, then by all means, let's get you a drawer.
I don't need much. One of those will do.
actually, that's not a good idea. Rupert arranges things meticulously.
you'll never win him over if you mess with his system.
your timing's perfect.
not always.
Susan will be needing a drawer.
a drawer, Sir?
Yes, for her things. She's gonna be spending more time here.
Yeah, rupe, I hope we can be good friends, 'cause you're gonna be seeing lots more of me.
Oh, madam, that hardly seems possible.
mother hodge, your food will get cold!
why, please, is there a lock on the liquor cabinet?
because your doctor says people taking your medication shouldn't drink, a warning you've chosen to ignore if the lipstick on the vodka bottle is any indication.
poached fish again? I don't want this.
I want what you're all having.
well, your doctor has you on a low fat, low sodium diet.
eight meals this week, eight times I've told you the same thing.
so... who would like to say grace?
allow me.
dear lord, I thank you for this bland, indifferently prepared meal and beseech you to ignite some spark of compassion in my coldhearted daughter-in-law, that she might show some shred of mercy to me, her wretched captive.
Amen.
mother, may I remind you, you asked to come here?
I didn't know I'd be trading one jail for another.
at least at the home you could bribe the orderlies to smuggle things in, but here, nothing gets past the commandant.
I have done everything I can to make you happy and comfortable.
what do you want from us?
I want my freedom.
I want out of this perky little gulag and into a house I can call my own, and you're going to buy it for me.
I can't afford to buy you a house.
you can't afford not to.
I know a house won't be easy to swing, but how many more of these Edward Albee dinners do you want to sit through?
what did she mean by "you can't afford not to"?
was she threatening you with something?
Yes, she's threatening to make us miserable till we cave.
look, at least see if Edie has any cheap listings.
we'll be happier, my mother will be happier
Yeah, and she'll take terrible care of herself and be dead in a year.
you just stole my next argument.
okay, you've got enough money to pay either the phone or the cable bill, but not both.
Hello?
I'm trying to help you here.
Oh, I'm sorry. Just do whatever you want.
fine. Cable it is.
nobody calls you anyway.
what do you want?
my toilet's clogged.
I thought maybe you could fix it.
Oh, wait, you can't, can you?
cause you don't have any tools.
must be tough being a plumber without tools.
why don't you people leave me the hell alone?
jeez, you sure are hostile for a guy who makes his living in the service industry.
you know, it just occurred to me, there's no point in paying the cable bill if you're not gonna have electricity, so I'm thinking pay the electricity upfront and...
where have you been? They're all waiting for you.
I'm here to teach fashion, so I'm fashionably late.
cute. Now remember, these mothers have refinanced trailers in order to pay for this, so when you make your entrance, for god sakes, sparkle.
now in addition to her three "Vogue" covers, you may remember her as the face of La Roque cosmetics.
please welcome Miss Gabrielle Marquez!
Vern? A moment.
is there a problem? - Yes!
what am I supposed to do with that petting zoo out there?
not everyone wins the genetic lottery like you did.
these girls need help finding the promised land of beauty and style.
please, Gabrielle, be their Moses.
good comparison, because it's gonna take a miracle to turn these mutts into show dogs.
Hey. girls, let's talk beauty.
what's up, brother?
I'm sorry. You are...
Carlos from down the street.
we were only best friends, dude.
Oh, um, well, things have been a little fuzzy since the accident.
I'm sorry that I, uh, I hadn't come by sooner, but my divorce has been kicking my ass.
I'm sorry to hear that.
anyway, I got a new condo, but it's getting renovated, so I was thinking maybe I could crash here.
here?
Yeah, I could help you out around the house and free you up to focus on job one
getting better.
cause you're tossing it to Edie now, right?
that's a real relationship killer, needing your lady to hoist you off the can.
well, how long are we talking?
couple months. Three at the most.
and, of course, I can kick in for half the utilities and rent.
well, how can I say no to my best friend?
what are the Blake kids doing all the way over here?
Pam needs to keep a closer eye on them.
will you please come away from that window? You barely slept last night.
come on. Take a nap.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
hold on.
Hey, what's up?
I've been meaning to get this back to you and to thank you.
Rebecca and I really enjoyed the cake.
Oh! Good.
so...
Bye.
so what'd you think of our place?
sorry?
I heard you were good friends with the young family.
it must have been weird being in there with all the new furniture.
I-I didn't notice.
well, how about the kitchen?
Rebecca likes the color, but I'm not so sure.
Oh, sorry. Never made it past the living room.
what? ! come on!
you're in an empty house, curious about your new neighbors...
you look around. We all do it.
well, I don't.
well, next time you're over, I'll have to give you the tour.
great, great.
Mr. Protector man! - Hey, hey. Not now, Parker.
I just wanted to see if I can play his pinball machine again.
I guess there's no need for that tour.
all right, girls, first things first, if you can't walk, you can't win.
hit it, Vern!
remember, eyes forward, shoulders back, hips square.
look left, look right, whip and walk.
Yes, I'm unbelievable. Close your mouths.
uh, okay, stop, stop.
what?
my eyes were forward, my hips were square.
but where's your confidence? Where's your pride?
come on. What do I have to be proud of?
have you guys ever seen a runway model without the hot clothes and makeup?
well, trust me, they're not that special, but the one thing that they do have is attitude.
you have to believe in yourself, and if not, pretend to believe in yourself, okay?
all right.
now I want you to pretend you're on the runway...
flashbulbs are popping, everyone's looking at you, envying you, and they're all thinking the same thing
Isabel Horowitz is smoking hot!
go, Isabel! Go!
you're doing it! Isabel, you're doing it!
that's it! Keep going!
I was walking! - Oh! You
you were totally walking! Good job!
all right, Donna, you're next.
get up there and make me hate your beauty.
now this place is a real diamond in the rough.
cozy little 2-bedroom plus den, with a highly motivated seller.
Oh, look, a highly motivated cockroach.
Oh!
let's try to be positive, people.
it's a fabulous location.
just walking distance to all sorts of fun shops.
right! From here I can see a bail bondsman and an adult bookshop.
what do you expect in your price range, "Tara"?
let's go. Thank you.
wait.
I'm not an impractical woman.
I know that my son's resources are like his achievements... rather limited.
I want to see the rest of it.
okay.
now the lighting in the kitchen is a bit harsh. The previous owner
well, let's just say he ran some sort of home-based medical business.
you cannot let your mother move into this neighborhood.
it's filled with junkies and whores.
Yeah, and we'll owe them all an apology, but who cares? She likes it.
of course she likes it.
there's a 24-hour liquor store across the street.
look, she wants a house. This is the best we can afford without bankrupting ourselves.
Orson, what if something should happen to her?
stop worrying about her. Worry about us.
do you realize how much we've been fighting since she came?
the woman's ruined every relationship that's mattered to me, and she's doing it again.
Oh, my god!
are you all right? - Mother? Mother?
it's just a little spill. Her cane hit a loose tile.
is anything broken?
well, obviously, the damn floor.
we'll need that fixed before she moves in.
are you insane? She obviously can't be on her own.
why, it's a loose tile.
I'm perfectly fine.
and what if you weren't?
what if she had broken something and she was lying here for hours?
you are coming home with us.
Bree- and I will not hear another word on the subject.
I can't believe you bought us pizza.
well, you guys earned it.
but eat fast, because we only have one hour left, and I want to introduce you to your new best friend
Mr. Spray Tan.
you know so much cool stuff.
can't you come back another day?
Oh, I don't know.
please? - You have to.
well, let me check my book.
I might have to move some stuff around, but I think I can swing it.
your life must be so exciting, huh?
Yeah, every day's a parade.
so what was it like being a famous model?
honestly, it was like any other job, except the pay was great, the clothes were couture and the parties were just this side of Gomorrah.
you don't know what "Gomorrah" means, do you?
good.
did you know Kate Moss?
I invited her to a party once.
did you eat pizza with her?
cause if you did, it's almost like we ate pizza with her.
well, honey, most models don't eat pizza.
well, at least not without having a finger for dessert.
gross.
I know. I never did that.
you would not believe the horrible things these girls did to stay skinny.
like what?
well, some would smoke those unfiltered french cigarettes.
but cigarettes can kill you.
but before they do, they kill your appetite.
one time, there was a girl who took too many laxatives, and, uh...
well, if you're ever at the chateau Milan in room 238, do not use the jacuzzi.
do you have to be skinny to be a model?
well, yeah. When's the last time you saw a fat person on a magazine cover?
now I'm gonna go talk to Vern about our next session.
you guys finish lunch so we can get back to work.
Hi, Rupert!
I went to the mall and bought a change of clothes for the weekend, and while I was there, I got something for you.
I thought you could wear it on your day off.
do you like it?
very much.
it'll come in handy should my nationality ever slip my mind.
that was good.
you... I wanna party with you.
Hey. I was thinking this afternoon maybe we could go look for that drawer.
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm afraid I have all this silver to polish.
well, let me help you, and we can talk.
there is so much I wanna know about you.
who is Rupert Cavanaugh?
what makes him tick?
tell you what
let's go find you that drawer, hmm?
Oh, isn't the master bedroom down that way?
I realize it's a bit of a jaunt, but I managed to find you an entire bureau.
okay, well, you certainly didn't have to go to all that trouble.
is there a problem?
uh, no, I-I-I just, well, all I really needed was just a little...
little drawer, and, uh, this is just so far away
and what is that smell?
Oh, yes, about that
the cat passed away in this room.
did you consider removing the body?
well, if this isn't acceptable,
I can look elsewhere for a drawer when I have the time.
why do you have to be this way?
what way is that?
listen, I know how you feel about Jane, but if you could just give me a chance...
I mean, come on, you... you can't possibly hate me this much, can you?
I'm done. Oh, fine. Fine, fine...
I don't need you to like me, but I think you should give me just a little respect.
I am Ian's girlfriend.
he's still married.
at best, you're his mistress.
okay, you are not allowed to call me that.
fine.
what term would you prefer?
concubine?
consort?
gold-digging whore?
I'm so sorry. I'm
I-I-I shouldn't have done that.
but, rupert, you have to admit, it's just a drawer.
those drawers are filled with Jane's things.
this is her house.
you are a guest in her house, and a temporary one at best.
okay, you know, that is for Ian to decide.
Oh, he has decided.
why do you think he never told me about you?
why did he wait so long to bring you here?
he didn't want you in that room, where he still keeps Jane's things exactly as she left them.
but... I'll keep looking for that drawer.
Hey. I'm going over to Mike's.
I thought you were gonna mow the lawn.
I know.
it's just that I promised I'd help him install a shower bar, and, um, it could take a while.
okay.
T-Rex.
how they hanging, brother?
low and lazy.
Hey, if Lynette asks,
I installed your shower bar today.
you got it.
Vern, what are you doing here?
we need to talk. - Is it about the girls' makeup?
cause I got them each their own makeup kit, custom-tailored to match their skin tone.
and I got Melina some wax. I know she's only 11, but those greek genes are gonna kick in any day now.
what? - This morning, Mrs. Hayes caught Donna her finger down her throat trying to barf up her toaster waffle.
Really?
and Mrs. Horowitz found Isabel behind their garage smoking.
apparently, she thought cigarettes would help her lose a few pounds.
where do you think she got that idea?
those damn tobacco companies! - Gaby!
Oh, fine, I may have told a few stories about the old days, but as a warning.
I didn't say anything inappropriate for kids.
Cassie Warren asked her mother if she could throw a Gomorrah party.
okay, look, we have to do damage control. I get it.
next session, I'll apologize to all the moms.
there's not gonna be a next session for you.
the moms don't want you anywhere near their daughters.
but I'm helping them.
they love me!
wait, please, Vern, you have to give me a chance to fix this.
it's too late, Gaby.
you are now officially a bad influence.
well, see you at spin class.
mom said we couldn't leave.
I'm just going out front.
what the hell is that?
stop running the ball!
can I ask you guys something?
what was I like before the accident?
what do you mean?
I mean, what kind of guy was I? Was I happy? Was I angry?
did I ever get violent?
you were fine.
look, I'm serious.
I really need to know.
you... you can be honest. You're my best friend.
honestly?
you were sort of mysterious, kept to yourself.
nobody really knew you all that well.
and this is coming from your best friend.
I'm sorry, guys,
I just... I guess I was really tired.
uh, where's your brother?
he went outside. - Yeah.
what... okay, watch her!
watch her. I'll be back. I'll be right back.
Hello? Open up! Open the door!
Lynette? What's the matter?
I want my son.
he's not here.
he's not at our house, he's not in our yard.
do not jerk me around.
you can't just barge into my house like this Lynette.
don't play dumb with me.
I know exactly what is down here!
Where's the pinball? Where's all the games?
Oh, that was a collection I was taking up for the children's hospital.
I delivered everything yesterday.
did you donate the photos, too?
what exactly is it ？you're accusing me of?
don't pretend you don't know.
I'm calling the police. Parker!
is there a problem?
you're damn right, there's a problem. I can't find my son.
isn't that your son?
where have you been?
we were at mike's. He wandered over looking for me.
what... what's going on?
that was the children's hospital.
art's story checks out.
he donated all that stuff.
that proves nothing. He knew I was on to him. He had to dump it someplace.
honey, believe me, I am with you.
there is something fishy about this guy.
but you gotta get a grip.
you can't go barging into people's homes.
what if Parker had been in there? - But he wasn't, and if you keep accusing this guy whout proof, he can sue us.
listen...
I've been thinking that after everything that you have been through
please don't bring up the supermarket again.
that was a traumatic experience.
I think it's affected you more than you realize.
and maybe you need to talk to somebody about it...
you know, like a therast.
you're right.
I need to talk to someone.
he'd gotten rid of everything
the toys, the pictures, everything was gone.
you can't sit on this, Lynette.
I know!
if something happened to someone's kid because I kept my mouth shut...
the thing is, I promised Tom I'd back off.
well, I didn't.
Jane has some beautiful things.
Yes, she's always had impeccable taste.
I, um, I know how it must seem to you, my holding on to them.
but I-I just couldn't bring myself to
I get it.
as much as I have tried to pretend that it's just you and me...
there's three of us in this relationship.
Susan, you... you know I adore you.
no, please, listen...
the last couple of months,
I thought we've gotten really close, and I have been loving that.
um, I just feel like lately...
there's this limit to how far you'll let me in.
well, I'm... I'm trying.
it's just the, um, the more I-I let you into my heart, the more I feel I'm pushing Jane out and
you don't have to push Jane out to let me in.
of course. You're right.
do you know what I think? - No.
that kind of compassionate wisdom deserves an obscenely expensive meal.
okay, well, give me a minute, and I will change into something nice.
uh, Rupert still hasn't found you a drawer?
no, not just yet.
well, in that case...
Ian, you don't have to do that.
if I can make room in my heart for both of you,
I can certainly make room in my bureau.
it's just not right. Your mother skipped lunch, too.
she said she wasn't hungry.
can't we just revel in her absence?
I know she's a handful, but she deserves some compassion.
the woman watched a dream die yesterday.
we all did.
I'm taking her dinner up.
Oh, that's okay. I'll do it.
no, I'd rather do it myself.
I wanna talk to her.
Oh, well, I'll let her know you're coming.
mom's coming. Ditch the wine.
very well.
you finished the whole bottle already?
I was... thirsty.
Gloria, I've been thinking and
does no one in this house ever bother to knock?
is that alcohol?
where did you get that?
when my grandma asks me a favor with tears in her eyes, how
Oh, shut up, you little extortionist.
he charged me 20 bucks, plus 5 for the corkscrew.
I'll deal with you later.
you can kiss that codeine good-bye.
andrew brought her wine.
Oh, for god's sake.
this is our house.
if you expect to stay here, you're going to learn to obey a few rules.
I don't obey rules. I make them.
not anymore, mother.
just watch yourself, sunny boy.
okay, look, I know you're upset, but don't blame Orson. It's not his fault.
it's all his fault.
you think he's so wonderful.
you don't know the half of what he's done.
let's go.
I can't deal with her when she's like this.
he doesn't want you to hear the truth
how he cheated on Alma.
what?
she's drunk!
how he broke her heart... and mine, all for his precious Monique.
you shut up, mother.
I thought that was Harvey Bigsby's mistress.
Oh, she got around, that girl!
see, I told you. I told you she would do this.
there he was, cheating on Alma, not knowing all the time this whore was cheating on him.
stop it!
you shut your evil mouth!
or what?
what are you gonna do to me that hasn't already been done?
Bree! no!
Bree, wait!
I know. I thought it was so adorable.
miss Gabrielle! - Gabrielle!
what is she doing here?
I have no idea.
I told her she was banned.
okay, just give me a minute.
I'm sorry about what I said to the girls, and it won't happen again.
damn right. You're not going anywhere near our girls.
can't you give me a second chance?
why should we?
Yeah, I mean, you walk in here all clickety-clack, perfect little miss size zero, thinking you're all better than us.
we all saw the look on your face when you showed up.
I don't think I'm better than you.
hell, I envy you.
please.
no, it's true.
you have husbands and famils and a reason to wake up in the morning.
what do I have?
him.
teaching your kids about confidence and beauty is the most useful thing I've done since...
I don't know when.
and as much as I've helped them...
they've helped me so much more.
so please, I need this.
and I promise, no more talk about dodgy weight loss methods.
like the highly effective, non-FDA-approved diet pill I can get from my friends in Zurich...
in bulk.
well, I suppose the christian thing would be to forgive her.
well, why don't you ladies talk it over?
and I'm gonna work on posture with the girls.
Yeah! Come on!
Oh, thank god.
I've been driving around all night looking for you.
we saw that woman at the morgue on our wedding night.
you pretended not to know her.
Bree, I can explain.
no. I'm done.
you don't understand what happened.
there were two women in your life before me.
one vanished, and the other was killed.
that's all I need to understand.
I've packed some of your things.
I want you out of the house.
now.
please...
I love you.
I know...
but it scares the hell out of me.
dangerous men walk among us, and we can't always be sure of who they are or what secrets they hide.
but once our worst suspicions are confirmed, we can take action.
once their agendas are revealed...
we can take steps to protect ourselves and those we love.
Yes, dangerous men can cause great harm.
but sometimes the greatest danger they pose...
I'll take those.
is to themselves.
Gaby found a new calling...
Yes, I'm unbelievable. Close your mouths.
someone new moved in...
he's a bachelor who lives with his invalid sister.
but lynette found a dark secret...
our neighbor is a pedophile.
you can't sit on this, lynette.
Orson's mother revealed his past...
he cheated on alma, broke her heart for his precious Monique.
and the police couldn't find the evidence...
we couldn't find a toolbox. the man's a plumber.
until Mike tried to hide it.
I'll take those.
the annual block party was a winter tradition on Wisteria lane.
happy holiday
it was a way for the residents to spread holiday cheer.
everyone was invited...
including Art Shepard, the newest resident of Wisteria lane.
but as the big night drew near, more than holiday cheer was being spread around.
Hey, did you hear about the new guy that just moved in?
well, get a load of this...
apparently, the perv's got all this weird stuff in his basement.
no, seriously.
it's like this big kiddie trap full of toys.
by sunday evening, most of the gossiping had subsided, and the neighborhood was once again consumed by the spirit of the season.
friends laughed over eggnog, lovers kissed under mistletoe and the mood was jolly.
that is, until a certain guest made his appearance.
ho, ho, ho!
look who's here!
merry christmas, everybody!
merry christmas!
now, kids, who's been good this year?
Oh, come on, everybody was naughty?
what am I gonna do with this fire truck?
Joey, get back here.
what's going on?
I'm not sure.
let's go, girls.
art, maybe we should go.
Yes, for the residents of Wisteria lane, it was the most wonderful time of the year.
but for Arthur Shepard and his sister, it had turned t to be a very silent night.
for the residents of Wisteria lane, the holiday season could only begin once the decorations came out.
X-Mas
for some, that meant pulling out the colored lights.
holiday stuff
for others, it meant locating that holiday wreath.
winter crap
and then there were those eager to display their nativity scene.
but for a romantic few, it was all about the mistletoe.
you have to kiss me. It's the law.
while you're in a good mood, I thought I'd spring something on you.
my parents are coming to town.
your parents? Really?
and I wondered if you might be free to join us for dinner saturday.
Absolutely.
uh, so I assume this means they know about me?
but of course.
and they know about me as in...
mum, dad, bloody goodness. I've got myself a smashing new girlfriend.
that's adorable.
please don't do it in front of them.
right.
so, um, do you want me to make reservations at that little french place?
we--we could do that, but it's a-- it's a 4-hour layover and they're going to be exhausted, and I thought we might have a more enjoyable time if they came here and--and you made dinner for them.
okay, I guess it's time we have the conversation.
haven't you ever wondered why I've never cooked for you?
I-I just assumed that you were lazy.
no, I wish.
my cooking...
is not good.
well, my parents won't be expecting a gourmet meal.
will they be expecting stomach cramps, acid reflux, night sweats?
come on, you can't be that bad.
Oh, it is really important that I make them a home-cooked meal?
well, it's just that they're very old-fashioned hearth-and-home types, and they might wonder why-- why you didn't make the effort.
Oh, but it's okay.
you--you-- you'll win them over...
eventually.
okay, I'll give it a shot.
thank you.
now nothing elaborate. Just a simple roast and, uh, and sothing appropriate to go with it.
right...
like an ambulance.
no, Amy, small steps.
small!
little miss snowflake glides. She doesn't stomp.
is that better?
getting there, sweetie.
if she was a horse, we'd have to shoot her.
poor thing, she trie yeah, she's a trooper.
let's dump her. what?! Why?
pageant consultants are judged on the strength of their roster.
you know, we can't afford to bounce every nose-picking no-talent, but we can definitely lose the one who's dragging us down, and that's amy.
we can't do that! Her mother died last year.
Yes, I know, I know, and it's tragic, but we are running a business.
Amy is sucking up all of our time, and we should be focusing on Sherri.
she actually has a shot at winning.
how will I tell her family?
we'll do it together. We'll be very diplomatic.
are you sure about this?
the poor kid's been through the wringer and-- Amy!
for god sakes, little miss snowflake does not scratch down there!
well, then again, her mother died a year ago.
how long is she gonna milk it?
mother hodge, I have your breakfast.
just put it over there.
I'll pick through it later.
merry christmas.
what are you watching?
home movies.
it's fun looking back at the past, isn't it?
well, it's one way to kill time while you're waiting for death.
we also have cable.
have you decided what you're gonna do about orson?
decided? Yes.
have you called a lawyer yet?
I don't think that's any of your concern.
I don't mean to pry, but I think you're a good christian woman, and you deserve better than my son.
well, I will take that under advisement.
if you give him a chance, he'll draw you back in.
it's whahe does.
just walk away.
it's not that easy.
I love him.
you'll get over it.
I did.
Oh, hi!
merry christmas!
wait, wait, wait, wait.
well, believe merita, he scares me, too.
you know what?
we should have a meeting, get all the moms together and figure out what to do about this guy.
Yeah, saturday, your house. Sounds good.
Hey, Rita, I gotta go.
sorry, I can't talk now. I have somewhere to go.
well, my brother doesn't.
the youth center just fired him.
are you happy?
I'm not sad. He shouldn't be around kids. I saw those pictures.
those boys were on his swim team.
he was proud of them.
turning that into something dirty says more about you than him.
you can defend him all you want.
I know what I know.
did you know my brother got spit on the hardware store yesterday, that they refused to serve us at the diner, that our tire got slashed at the church parking lot?
I am not a well woman.
I don't need this stress.
well...
I am sorry that happened.
have you considered even for a moment that you could be wrong, that you misinterpreted what you saw, that you are ruining my brother's life and mine over nothing?
I have kids, okay?
better safe than sorry.
as long as you're safe, what do you care who's sorry?
so I'm cooking dinner for Ian's parents tomorrow night,
and it's the first time I'm meeting them, so I sort of wanna impress them.
and yet you're cooking?!
well, that's the thing.
uh, so I was hoping--you know, if you're not too busy...
Oh, no, no, these things practically build themselves.
thank you. You are a lifesaver.
actually...
I could probably use the distraction.
Oh?
I asked Orson to move out last night.
Oh, come on!
why would you bury your toolbox in the woods?
I knew the cops were looking for it, and I panicked.
I was just trying to buy myself me time.
well, you may have bought yourself 20 to life!
Oh, let the guy enjoy his breakfast. Stay out of this, carlos.
Mike, I want you to look at me.
Yeah, you look me in the eye and you swear to me that you didn't kill anybody.
how many times do I have to tell you? I can't remember.
you can't remember, or you don't wanna remember?
um, guys.
Bree, you have got to go to the police with all of this.
I can't. Not yet.
I-I need some time to think.
his wife goes missing, then his mistress turns up dead.
what is there to think about?
I know it sounds suspicious, but in my heart of hearts, I just can't believe that Orson could do such a thing.
sweetie, we all wanna believe the best of the people we care about, but you cannot let your feelings for a man blind you to cold hard facts.
what in the world?
Oh, my god!
what's going on?
they just arrested mike for murder.
What?!
they're saying he killed that woman on the news, that Monique person.
Oh, thank god!
I can't believe we're gonna break that little girl's heart.
do not wimp out on me here.
we gotta do what's best for the business.
what if the father yells at me?
then I will jump in and defend you.
okay, but if you do, try and be diplomatic.
I'm always diplomatic.
now just get in there, you spineless 'mo.
excuse me, mr. Pearce?
I'm so glad you could come today.
this is my partner Gabrielle.
pleasure to meet you.
shall we?
so, uh, what did you wanna talk to me about?
is there a problem with Amy?
not a problem, per se.
we're just a little concerned that she might not have the, um...
temperament for pageant competitions.
and what does that mean?
well, when it comes to performing, she's not exactly...
well, she tends to be-- feel free to jump in.
I have no idea where you're going with this.
well, as Gaby and I discussed, amy has certain limitations and her odds of winning are slim.
he is so competitive.
I constantly have to remind him they're just kids.
when did you lose the joy?
Oh, I think you know.
wait, I'm--I'm confused.
are you--are you dumping amy?
of course not, Bill.
can I call you Bill?
it's just, we feel that Amy would benefit from some private coaching.
maybe I could come to your house?
say, friday, 5:00?
sure.
Yeah, I guess.
great! It's a date.
maybe I should come, too.
after the harsh things you said about amy?
I don't think so.
I'm gonna need a good lawyer and that may take a little research.
and whoever takes my case will need a retainer, so if you don't mind, I promise I'll pay you back.
Oh, okay.
and makeure he knows about my wrench.
apparently, they tested it and found traces of this monique's blood.
what's wrong?
I don't know if you picked up on this, mike, but...
I haven't been happy.
no, I didn't pick up on it.
well, I wanted to tell you this weeks ago and I wish that I had, because now I know you're gonna think that I'm breaking up with you over this whole blood on the ax thing.
wrench.
whatever.
but believe me, that's not it.
it's just.
we are moving too fast.
what are you trying to say?
well, may--maybe we should just...take a break.
you know...date other people.
you're telling me this on the day I'm put in a men's prison?
well, I said the timing was bad.
I am sorry. I...
I really am.
I just can't
they told me somebody was coming, but I did not expect it to be you.
is Edie getting you a good lawyer?
I doubt it.
she dumped me today.
what? Why?
well, i was arrested for murder.
still...
it's tacky.
well, okay then, uh...
I-I'll help get you out.
what's your bail?
a million dollars.
you don't have to help me, Susan.
I want to.
aren't you gonna ask?
what?
if I killed that woman?
I don't have to. I know you didn't.
I wish I was that sure.
I...
I have these flashes where I see her face, so I must've known her.
and if I did, maybe something happened.
maybe I got angry, maybe-- there's an explanation f this, and we're gonna figure it out.
don't worry about a thing.
miss Gabrielle!
when are you gonna come outside and watch me?
Oh, um, the grass, honey, and my allergies...
go ahead and practice. I'll watch you from here.
are you sure I can't help with anything?
Ah, I've been a single dad for a while now.
I got the dinner thing down.
Mmm, I've got the restaurant thing down.
I can't bring myself to cook for one.
not that I ever cooked for two.
well, no restaurant tonight.
you are having dinner with us.
Oh, that's sweet.
it's the least I can do to thank you for helping Amy.
it's nothing.
Yeah, she's a special girl.
so...
how is it for you, being single again?
Oh, honestly?
I hate it.
it's like I've forgotten how to date.
me, too.
you know, I even let a friend of mine talk me into one of those speed dating things.
how was it?
Mmm, I didn't even go in.
I just sat in this hotel lobby.
I watched all these lonely, desperate single people filing in, and then it hit me
I'm one of them.
I know what you mean.
did you see that?
it spun three times and then I caught it.
you didn't see.
Yeah, I-I'm sorry, sweetie.
I-I was distracting Gabrielle.
Oh, no, no, it's totally my fault.
I'm sorry, sweetie.
go outside and do it again. I promise this time we're gonna watch.
come in.
wow, oh, those are gorgeous.
well, I,uh, I figured you'd be too busy cooking to manage a centerpiece.
well, you, uh, you may not be a good cook but you're-- you're certainly a tidy one.
don't worry. Dinner's all taken care of.
we're having...
Blanquette de veau and a grand marnier souffl.
well, that's very ambitious of you, and, uh, when will Bree be done making it?
but I am rewarming it all by myself.
Oh, what's, uh, what's all this?
um, Mike was arrest for murder.
my god.
I-I mean, of course he's totally innocent.
I'm just trying to help him find a lawyer.
shouldn't, um, shouldn't his girlfriend be doing that?
Yeah.
Edie dumped him.
okay, I know how this looks, but I just feel bad.
he's just a friend now.
Yes.
Yes, a friend you sat by for six months, hoping he'd wake up and ravish you again.
you are the only one allowed to ravish me these days, so stop worrying.
Orson, it's me again.
please call.
we need to talk.
I'll.You got it.
guys, why has it been so long since we've played poker?
I really need this. Oh, me, too.
there's nothing more relaxing than an afternoon of finger food and girl talk.
Hi, ladies!
how you doing?
so did you tell the police that you think Orson killed Monique?
What?!
no, I did not, and I don't plan to.
but Mike is in jail, and you said yourself you thought Orson did it.
I said I had concerns, concerns that have disappeared now that Mike has been arrested.
what are you saying? You think mike is guilty?
Hey, why don't we start that girl talk?
I'll get the ball rolling.
anybody have a suggestion?
they found Monique's blood on the wrench that Mike was trying to dispose of.
I mean, that hardly screams innocence.
her teeth were pulled.
you don't think that's worth telling the cops she was messing around with a dentist?
Orson was slipping it to the dead chick?
Mike is innocent. I know that in my heart.
we all have convictions, susan.
I believe Mike's last one was for manslaughter.
okay, okay, we've all made some excellent points and blown off a little steam.
let's play some cards.
if you're so sure that Orson is innocent, why don't we go through his things?
Where's his desk? At his office.
and what did you think you'd find there anyway?
I don't know.
a blackmail letter, a necklace made of teeth?
we're not gonna play cards, are we?
Nope.
well, I am certainly not playing with a woman that is willing to let mike take the fall for her psycho husband.
well, needless to say, I won't be cooking dinner for Ian's parents.
fine.
I'll cook myself. Good.
let me know if there are any survivors.
and if you take Orson back, you do the same.
well, that was incredibly awkward.
I'm sorry you both had to sit through it.
was it me? Was I out of line?
Orson office
Hey, come on in. You're just in time.
thanks so much, Rita.
I think it's such a good idea that we all get together and talk and...
sex offenders out!
what is all this?
Oh, we decided to stage a protest in front of Art's House.
a protest?
Rita, I want the word "pedophile" to really stand out.
do we have any glitter?
say "molester." It sounds scarier.
I'm sorry.
I-I-I thought we were all gonna talk about how to keep an eye on this guy.
we're past talking the guy's a menace.
well, that's what we think, but we don't exactly have proof.
the youth center just fired him.
how much proof to you need?
but, see, the only reason they fired him is because people were gossiping, and the only reason they're gossipg is because of what I told Mrs. Mccluskey.
Yeah, and you told me to spread the word.
so--so that people could watch their kids and be vigilant.
so you wanna wait until he actually molests one of our kids?
whose side are you on, lynette?
knock it off, Gert.
remember, if it weren't for lynette, we never would've found out about this secret.
she's our hero.
Hodge general dentstry Orson hodge dds the 22-yard line, the give is to Harrison, who is hit immediately and dropped for a loss in his own backfield...
Bye-bye, daddy.
see you, sweetie. Have fun.
so I was, uh, I was thinking you-- you wanna grab a cup of coffee or something after class?
I'd love to grab a cup of coffee...
or something.
Amy, you are so lucky to have such a nice dad.
Yeah, I know.
leave him alone.
excuse me?
you heard me.
I don't want you dating him.
Oh, sweetheart.
I have a feeling I know what this is about.
no, you don't. I think I do.
you miss your mommy, and it feels funny seeing your daddy be nice to somebody else.
but believe me, I'm not trying to replace your mom.
well, I am, and I have someone all picked out.
what?
I want my dad to marry Sherri's mom.
Sherri from class?
we're best friends, and we have it all planned out.
our parents are gonna get married, and then we'll be real sisters.
what about your dad? Don't you care what he wants?
my mom died.
all my dad wants is for me to be happy.
now get in there and teach me how to work the runway.
that's what we're paying you for, right?
runs it left, swings it around.
he fights his way to the 25 for another first down, and that should just about do it.
I tell you, with 1: 12 left on the clock and no time-outs remaining...
why haven't you returned any of my calls?
I was afraid you were calling to ask me for a divorce.
no, I wasn't.
they arrested Mike for the murder of Monique Polier.
they did?
the other night, you wanted a chance to explain everything.
well, here it is, and I want it all.
if I find out you've left anything out, then I will ask for that divorce.
okay.
you're working so hard, Sherri.
you must really wanna win this pageant.
more than anything.
well, I think dedication should be rewarded, so I have a little surprise for you.
what is it?
well, you know how the pageant starts with a big opening number?
this year, all the contestants are gonna dance in pairs, and I've arranged for yoto dance with your best friend Amy!
what's wrong, sweetie?
well...
Amy sucks.
well, I thought you two were practically sisters?
we are...
but she still sucks.
and first impressions are everything.
you said so yourself.
well, that's true-- and this is the opening number.
if the judges see me tripping all over that klutz, there's no way I'm gonna win.
that's a good point.
now I wish I hadn't told Amy.
you already told her?!
she was so excited.
well, she's your best friend.
why don't you just tell her the truth? She'll understand.
what if she doesn't?
well, friends come and go...
but a crown is forever.
I never loved Alma.
my mother pushed us together, and...
I was stupid enough to get her pregnant.
you had a child?
alma miscarried a month after the wedding.
I was trapped.
well, you could've left her.
mother wouldn't hear of it.
divorce is a sin.
so I stayedin the marriage, hoping I would come to feel what I was supposed to, but I never did.
so I resigned myself to a life without love.
and then I met monique.
it was wrong.
I didn't care.
I loved her more than I'd loved anyone...
till you.
so why couldn't you tell me this?
because you told me about Rex, how he cheated on you, how hurt you were.
Bree, I needed you to feel safe with me.
well,
handling the truth would have been a hundred times easier than dealing with all the doubt and suspicion.
so you stayed in a loveless marriage because of your mother?
I know how it sounds.
but after my father died, she's all I had.
his death caused me so much pain.
sheffield school for boys grade report
I would've done anything for her.
xxxxxxx she saw that weakness, and she ran with it.
mental hospital admissions for committed patients。 you--you've got no idea how manipulative she can be.
she ruins lives.
now I've told you everything.
what happens now?
well...
first you pack up your things and come home, and then...
we toss your mother out on her evil ass.
God, I love you.
Hi!
I'm sorry I'm late.
where are your folks? They're not coming.
their plane was snowed in at O'hare.
well, that's too bad.
well, no harm done then, huh?
you're 40 minutes late.
but they're not here.
you didn't know that. And where's dinner?
Bree and i sort of had a fight.
look, I'm awfuy sorry that I'm late.
I-I had an emergency.
did this emergency have anything to do with mike?
I'm pretty sure that Bree's husband murdered the woman the cops think Mike killed.
I went to his office-- oh, for god sakes, susan.
no, no, I found evidence.
look.
Orson was committed to a mental institution for over a year.
I mean, doesn't that suggest he's some sort of-- I don't care!
tonight meant a great deal to me, and you blew it off.
I said I was sorry Ian.
I have to help mike. I'm all he's got.
actually, you're wrong.
he's got me.
what?
tomorrow, I'll hire the best lawyer in town to defend him, and I'll pay every cent of his bill.
you would do that for mike?
Yes, on one condition...
you can't see him anymore.
Why?
if you start visiting him, being a friend to him, he'll fall in love with you again.
then you'll have to decide whose heart to break, his or mine.
as jealous ultimatums go, that's very flattering, but I don't think that's necessary.
Mike and I are done.
then you should have no problem accepting my generous offer.
you would really get him the best lawyer in town?
an absolute piranha.
do we have a deal?
well, okay then.
you know, Mike barely remembers me.
what makes you so sure he would fall in love with me again?
what a perfectly asinine question.
how could he not?
God, I was only in the house 15 minutes.
are there more of them now?
Yep.
go ahead, say it. I know you want to.
this is all your fault. You should've listened to me.
I know, but be fair. There is no way I could've anticipated this.
you tell people frankenstein's on the loose, then you're surprised to see the torch-wielding villagers?
I'm putting the kids to bed early. I don't want 'em to see this.
is that an ambulance?
I can't believe you're doing this!
Amy, don't you want me to have a chance?
God, I hate you!
I hate you!
don't ever talk to me again!
Hi. Bill?
I was wondering, do you have plans saturday night?
excuse me.
ma'am, I need you to step back.
okay.
we're brinng in a female, late 30s.
and get crash car ready. She's in cardiac arrest.
there he is.
stop it! Stop it!
you can't do this to people!
have you lost your minds?!
well, excuse us for wanting to feel safe in our own homes.
well, that's my home, and I don't feel very safe right now.
please, please, all of you, just leave this street.
please, I beg of you. Go!
just get off my street, please!
wait, wait!
art, wait, I'm sor
I'm sorry.
you're an idiot to take him back.
I am no longer interested in your opinion.
I thought I made that clear.
where are you sending me?
Oh, we've rented you a condo in a lovely retirement community.
it's our christmas gift to you.
so you're exiling me?
cutting me off from my new grandchildren?
that's our gift to them.
you think you can be rid of me that easily?
it's over, mother.
I told her everything.
Oh, I doubt that very much.
you still have secrets, my boy.
so do you, mother, and if you want them kept, you'll keep mine.
it's me. I have some bad news.
she's taking him back.
meet me on the corner in an hour.
we need to deal with this.
I heard about Rebecca on the news.
if there's anything I can do to help, uh, with the funeral arrangements or, uh...
help you call relatives...
you must be feeling really guilty.
of course!
I-I-I feel just terrible.
I-I mean, if you knew, if you could just know I'm--how sorry I am.
Hey.
you know, in a weird way...
I should thank you.
my sister was...
a really wonderful person.
she always saw the best in me.
but there were things she couldn't see...
or chose not to, god love her.
what do you mean? I think you know.
see, I always knew that I had to take care of rebecca, so I could never let myself...
slip and do something that would hurt her.
but now...
I'm free...
and all because of you.
you--you can't stay here.
Oh, don't worry. I'm already packed.
where are you going?
why, you gonna write?
well...
good-bye, lynette.
you take care of that beautiful family of yours.
there's a reason people can't wait for christmas, and it has little to do with family reunions...
or curling you with a cup of eggnog...
or that unexpected kiss beneath the mistletoe...
or receiving a present from that special someone.
no, people look forward to christmas because they know...
it's a time...
for miracles.
Hello, Alma.
don't just stand there.
tell me everything.
Victor made himself perfectly clear.
whenever I've truly wanted something, I've always gotten it.
Bree needed to get away.
we're finally taking our honeymoon.
Susan couldn't wait to pop the question.
will you marry me?
Lynette received shocking news.
you can see this, it could be lymphoma.
why are you so reluctant to make a commitment to me?
because I'm not in love with you.
and Edie... - what if we tried to have a baby?
engaged in a dangerous deception.
when Gabrielle Solis agreed to marry Victor Lang, she was determined to have a very traditional wedding.
she was even more determined to be a very traditional bride.
to that end, the handkerchief in her cleavage was borrowed, the garter on her leg was blue, and the diamonds on her ears were old.
but sadly for Gabrielle, something was missing, and she was about to throw a traditional fit.
it is after 3: 00! Where the hell is Bree with my "something new"?!
I know her plane landed on time. She'll probably be here any second.
God, I should have my head examined for even agreeing to this.
who the hell cares about Swiss jewelry anyway?
Gaby, Bree went out of her way to buy you that bracelet.
and, of course, it's the hottest day of the year.
all the guests are out there sweating like pigs.
God, at this rate, my reception's gonna look like the finish line of the Boston Marathon.
if you're that freaked out, just get married without the bracelet.
are you out of your mind?!
I can't get married without my "something new."
Oh, I have an idea.
I just got a lipstick yesterday.
you could wear that.
I just paid a makeup artist 500 bucks to do my face.
do you really think I wanna march down the aisle looking like just ate a popsicle?
okay, it's your big day, so I'm gonna let that slide.
God, it is 10 after, and Bree is never late!
where can she be?
all right, that's it.
after I finish "zhuzhing" my hair, tell the preacher it's showtime.
I can't believe my wedding's already ruined, and it hasn't even started.
Hey, I'm starting to get worried about Bree.
maybe we should call. - Yeah.
I'm calling her cell.
it's ringing. - oh, good.
Oh, wow!
Hello, ladies.
is that Bree? She better not have come empty-handed!
Oh, I didn't.
as promised, Bree had arrived with something new.
holy crap!
and she also brought the bracelet.
three days earlier
family... there is nothing more important.
they're the ones we want to laugh with during the good times...
and the ones we need to console us during the bad.
and even though the time comes when they have to leave us, their voices still linger in our minds.
and sometimes we can't help but listen.
a tangled web-- that's what you're weaving.
beat it, mother.
you really think this little scheme of yours is gonna work?
of course it will.
look at him.
he's practically in love with me already.
that's because he thinks you're gonna give him a baby.
wait till he finds out you're still on the pill.
Oh, shut up, would you?!
I just thank the good lord your father didn't live to see this.
well, neither did you.
you died alone in a trailer park watching game shows.
and why should I listen to you?
cause I know what's waiting for you, missy.
this one's gonna leave you like all the others.
you're going to end up old and alone, just like I did.
down here, babe!
I'm making you a fruit smoothie.
chicken or fish?
what?
I haven't gotten your reply card back yet. So chicken or fish?
Oh! Right, your wedding.
I can't go. - Why not?
I'm a jinx.
I went to your last wedding, look how that turned out.
come on, Gaby. We both know it'd be weird if I went.
okay, maybe a little, but it'll be weirder if you don't.
excuse me?
look, everyone knows you're living with Edie.
if she shows up alone, people will think I asked her not to bring you, like it bugs me that you guys are together.
but it does bug you. You hit the roof when you found out.
which is why I have to show people that I'm okay with it.
please, just consider it my wedding gift.
okay, but I'm skipping the ceremony.
What?!
and just go to the reception? You can't do that.
I don't want to make a scene.
you'll vow, "till death do us part,"
I'll bust out laughing, people will stare...
reception starts at 4: 00.
I'm thinking a chocolate fountain would be a cool centerpiece to a dessert buffet.
dessert buffet?
we're having a wedding cake, right?
isn't that dessert?
Yeah, but you have to give people a choice.
don't you think a chocolate fountain would be elegant?
I don't know... you, a big white dress, melted chocolate.
am I the only one hearing alarm bells?
fine, we'll skip the chocolate.
how about a champagne fountain? Oh, I know!
maybe we can make the champagne flow through the ice sculpture.
don't you think we might be going a little over-the-top?
Mike, these are all fairly standard wedding features.
now you name one thing that you think is going over-the-top.
how about the dove wrangler?
well, the doves are not going to release themselves.
do we really need 40 of 'em?
okay, I know that you think I' being silly, but all of our friends went to Bree's wedding, and now they're going to Gaby's.
two months from now, do we really want them thinking our wasn't as nice?
it seems to me our friends wouldn't be there to make petty comparisons.
they'd be there to celebrate our love.
you would think that, but no.
come on.
this is something that we have both looked forward to for so long.
don't you want it to be perfect?
Oh, I guess.
about the doves, though...
what?
you in a wedding gown, 40 birds circling overhead?
again, not liking those odds.
Oh, it's not as bad as it sounds.
it's, um, Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and apparent, if you're going to get lymphoma, that's the kind you want.
Hey, you wanna hold it down up there, kids?
I'm trying to talk to your aunt Lucy!
thank you!
anyway, I know I said that we would come and visit you this June, but I'll be a little woozy and bald from the chemo, so...
thanks for understanding.
Oh, one more thing
our insurance policy has a really high deductible, so we are strapped financially, and I was wondering if maybe you and Dave might be able to...
Oh, really?
no, I am not asking mom.
she doesn't know about any of this, so don't you tell her, okay?
we'll be fine. I love you.
Bye.
I take it that's a "no" on the loan?
Yep.
Dave lost his job at the plant, and he is now handing out flyers at a chicken restaurant, and
Ouch so where are we gonna find this $10, 000?
you leave that to me.
I want you to focus on getting better.
but, honey... - I will find it.
meanwhile, we'll make some sacrifices around here.
my tennis club membership is up this month.
I'm not renewing.
should you even be playing tennis after your back surgery?
probably not.
well, in that spirit, as soon as I start chemo, I will be giving up shampoo.
okay, thanks.
taxi's here.
are you sure you're ready to go back?
we could wait another week.
and miss Gaby's wedding? No, I'll be fine.
is, uh, this the dress you were thinking for the ceremony?
Yes. - Oh, good.
I'll fold it in tissue so it doesn't wrinkle.
Oh, darling, I don't deserve you.
Oh, come on.
we agreed, no more tears.
I'm so sorry to be putting you through this.
I... I wouldn't blame you if you ran like hell and never looked back.
stop.
I'm going to raise this child and love it as if it were my own.
now let's see a smile.
well, I'm glad you could join us, Milton.
it's good to get to know you before the wedding.
thank you. You know, I must say, all these months, I thought Victor was exaggerating about you.
but he hasn't done you justice.
you, my dear, are a flawless beauty.
I'm hardly flawless.
I'm sure I have a blemish hidden away somewhere.
now that's a search I would relish.
she is way out of your league, dad.
honey, he's a multimillionaire.
he runs my league.
by the way, Victor, I, uh, ran into Keith Perkinsonlast week.
and how is the venerable state chairman? - Impressed with you.
he liked the way you ran your moral campaign, said if you keep your numbers up, he might consider supporting you in the next governor's race.
Really?
what's so funny?
you gotta be kidding, right?
I mean, we just finished a campaign.
you're not about to put me through another one.
but I thought you loved campaigning.
God, no. It's a complete snore.
pasting a smile on my face while you say the same speech for the 50th time?
but you were a natural. People loved you.
well, the feeling wasn't mutual.
you think I enjoyed sipping tea with these frumpy matrons who wore loud, polyblend pantsuits?
you know how many times I just wanted to scream, "vote for my husband, you color-blind cow!"?
I think you've discovered something very important about democracy, my dear
the nation is full of fools, and everyone gets a vote.
well, they're not gonna get us again.
I made nice with Fairview.
I'm not about to suck up to the whole damn state.
what are you doing?
some guy out in Mount Pleasant's got a cracked water heater.
it's 3: 00 in the morning.
well, I started advertising as a 24-hour plumber.
after midnight, I get triple time.
okay, well, that's crazy.
you can't work round the clock. It's not healthy.
well, this is the third night I've worked this week.
I'm fine so far.
you've been sneaking out while I've been asleep?
what are you, ninja plumber?
it's just for a little while, earn some extra money.
is this about the wedding?
we agreed we want it to be nice.
but we didn't agree on this.
maybe I can scale things back a bit.
how?
have a ginger ale fountain?
make paper doves and hope it's windy?
okay, seriously, you don't have to kill yourself.
I could max out my credit card.
is that really how you want to start our life together in debt?
no, I wanna start out happy.
but clearly, you're upset, and I don't know why.
I'm not Ian.
I can't afford to move you into a mansion or fly you off to Paris, but I'll be damned if I don't give you the same dream wedding he would have given you.
I'll see you in the morning.
I'm drawing pictures of trees.
where the hell do you get off having cancer and not telling me about it?!
mom...
how do you think you could handle this without me?
Oh, there's my Tommy boy!
come here!
Oh! God.
Oh, listen, be a love, will you, honey, and get my bags from the cab?
bags?
she's staying?
Yep.
and do not tip the driver.
sob wouldn't let me smoke.
jeez, Lynette, I didn't know you opened a day care center.
Hey, kids, grandma's here.
okay, what did you tell them about me?
it's been five years, mom.
they don't remember you.
well, they'll remember me this time.
I brought presents.
cool!
hey...
for you, and...you, and you.
these are baby toys.
we're too old to play with these.
well, I'm too old to remember what the hell 6-year-olds like to play with.
we're 8.
what do I care?
just say thank you.
thank you.
Oh, wh-who's the pretty thing?
your girlfriend?
No!
she's my sister!
Oh.
is that Tom's little b-a-s-t-a
okay, kids, time to get your toys and let's play upstairs.
come on, Penny.
come on, sweetie.
let's go, everybody.
listen, mom, I really appreciate you coming to help, but as you can see, I'm perfectly fine.
for now.
now how you gonna handle that mob when you're flat on your ass from chemo?
I'll manage.
you got through breast cancer while raising the three of us alone.
I was not alone.
I had you.
Lynette was all of 13, and she still looked after her sisters, cleaned the house, cooked the meals, and I was curled up in a ball, puking my guts out.
well, that's what you get when you mix chemo and vodka gimlets.
you can goad me all you like, Lynette.
I did not come here to fight.
now trust me, cookie,
I have memorized the whole catalog of subjects you and I can no longer discuss, and if that means that we have to talk about the weather for three months, then fine.
but I am staying.
now...
if you'll excuse me, I have to go kick a child out of its room.
okay.
legs up!
Oh, you wanna do it again?
no.
I've been doing a lot of research, and gravity helps facilitate the sperm reaching the eggs.
so...
Heave-ho!
Oh! Well, could we try a little light spooning before you hang me up like a side of beef?
Edie, we're trying to have a baby.
well, could we be a little less clinical?
maybe let nature take its course?
nature is not on our side anymore.
look, you're no spring chicken, and those eggs aren't exactly farm-fresh.
okay, stop referring to me as poultry.
sorry.
can we just try this? It's only for 30 minutes.
30 minutes?!
I am not staying in this position for a half an hour.
listen, I know that this requires some work, but it will all be worth it when we have our beautiful, beautiful baby.
right?
right.
I guess I could...make some sacrifices.
that's my girl.
can I get you anything?
Yeah. I'd kill for a beer.
sorry. No alcohol.
What?! For how long?
just until the baby's born.
Oh, and you stop nursing.
don't worry. I'll get you a nice herbal tea.
it's just for a few months while you're in treatment.
we're... we're gonna have to find someone to watch the kids.
No! I am not leaving that woman in charge of our children.
in three months, the twins will be chain-smoking, and Penny will be an alcoholic.
we can manage.
we've got Mccluskey.
she costs money... money that we won't have if we're paying someone to replace you at work.
you said not to worry about money, that you'd find it somewhere.
I did.
what, someone loaned us $10, 000?
no, gave us, and we can't thank her by kicking her out.
No! Tom, you didn't ask my mother?!
didn't have to.
she knew that you hit up Lucy, so she offered.
well, we're giving it back.
no, we can't afford to.
Tom, you don't know half the stuff she did to us.
she would get drunk and smack us around.
she would meet some new guy and then drop us off at her sister's for a week because he wasn't into kids.
okay, so she was a crappy mom.
you said yourself that she has mellowed.
now she wants to make amends.
if you would just try to understand...
I think that I've been pretty understanding lately.
what's that supposed to mean?
I think you know.
great, so in the middle of everything I'm dealing with, you're gonna throw Rick in my face.
when someone we love hurts us, if we still love them, we deal with it and we move on.
if I can do it, so can you.
so forgiving my mother...
that's my penance?
Yeah. I think it is.
I thought you said we weren't supposed to spend the night before the wedding together.
Yeah, I was trying to respect tradition...
but I got horny.
well, I guess we'll just have to start the honeymoon early, won't we?
let me get rid of this stuff.
what are you working on so late?
nothing.
polling data?
why are you polling? The election's over.
it's just a little research.
God, you look hot.
is this about running for governor?
because I told you how I feel about that.
my dad just set up a little... exploratory committee.
it's no big deal.
Oh. Okay, well, let's explore it now.
Nope, not gonna happen.
Gaby... Victor, ever since we met, it's been photo ops and fund-raisers, and I'm sick of it.
well, I'm a politician.
do you think I want my career to begin and end in the suburbs?
Fairview is my home, and I don't want to leave it.
and you can't make this decision without me.
I'm gonna be your wife.
exactly, not my career adviser.
Oh, so I don't even get a vote? - Not if it's a veto.
okay, look, no! I already married a man who put his career before me, and I swore I wasn't gonna do it again.
well, I swore I would not let a stupid woman hold me back.
that did not come out the way I wanted it to.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.
I've just been under a lot of pressure lately.
well, here's one less thing you have to worry about... our wedding.
you can't cancel the wedding.
it's too late.
as far as I'm concerned, it's just in the nick of time.
good morning, Gaby.
God, Milton, the newspaper's not even here yet.
I'm sorry it's so early. I just came to apologize.
Why? What happened wasn't your fault.
that's not exactly the case.
is that coffee I smell?
you only bolted because Victor wants to be governor.
he only wants to be governor because of me.
you only suggested it.
you can't make him go after something he doesn't want.
the hell I can't.
ever since he was a kid, Victor's been killing himself trying to live up to his big shot father.
he's desperate for my approval.
Why?
I suppose because he's never gotten it.
everything he does... even becoming mayor, I somehow let him know that it's not quite enough.
Oh...don't get me wrong.
I'm right to push.
that's why he's so successful.
so what are you saying, I should marry Victor because you're a withholding father?
no, I just want you to understand why he does what he does.
fine. I get it.
but why would I want a husband who values his father's opinion more than mine?
well, he doesn't really care much what I think anymore.
after you left last night, he called me and, uh...what's the phrase?
he did?
he said because of me, he'd lost the best thing that had ever happened to him, and if he could't win you back, I could take my money and buy a new son, because I was never gonna be hearing from him again.
he blew off $80 million?
well, if he cares about me so damn much, why am I not hearing this from him?
I think you're about to.
is there a back way out of here?
aren't you gonna be late for Gaby's wedding?
Oh, weddings are boring.
I like to sneak in at the end, look teary-eyed and pretend I was there the whole time.
I am gonna see you at the reception.
Oh! Uh, hi, Danny.
Um...Carlos, the paperboy's here.
could you pay him?
come on in. - Hey, here you go, Danny.
Oh. Uh, looks like I'm a little short.
can I catch you later?
no.
okay. Hold on.
Oh, my god.
what's that?
it's birth control pills.
I'm gonna need cash.
Hey, welcome home!
I have missed you, sweetheart!
Oh, here, allow me.
well, hello there, Julie.
you guys are back!
wow, somebody's blonder.
Oh, yeah, my mom hates it, too.
so where's Danielle?
well, um, while we were in Switzerland, she ran across this boarding school, and she fell in love with it and just insisted that we let her spend a year abroad.
Wow. She must be having a really good time.
she hasn't returned any of my phone calls.
Oh, well, um, you know, her school's up in the mountains, and
and her cell phone reception is kind of funky.
she hasn't answered my e-mails, either.
well, I am gonna call her tonight and have a little talk with her about commmon courtesy, and I'm sure that you will get an e-mail first thing tomorrow morning.
well, we should go. I've got to get that bracelet to Gaby before the wedding.
well, I'll see you guys there.
Bye.
well, that was uncomfortable.
you have no idea.
everyone's been asking questions.
this might not be as easy as we'd hoped.
there. Now you have something new.
so how do I look?
you are now officially the most beautiful bride that ever lived.
until your wedding, of course.
nice save.
it means so much to me that we're all here together right now.
And...break!
love you.
we are gathered here today to join together Victor Lang and Gabrielle Marquez in matrimony
an honorable estate not to be entered in lightly, but reverently and soberly.
this is a lifetime union, one based on love, honor and trust...
you wanna be my new best friend?
premium scotch. Keep it coming.
you are promising not only to give of yourself, but also to accept each other, promising not only to love for today, but to extend that love to include...
I thought you weren't coming until after... - save it...
okay, look, I can explain. - Don't bother!
your lies were more convincing when I cared.
Victor, do you take Gabrielle...
you've got to understand.
I do wanna have a baby with you, just not yet.
I...I just
I wanted to give you a chance to fall in love with me first.
I don't believe you, and I will never trust you again!
well, what was I supposed to do?
you backed me into a corner, and you were gonna bail on us, and I was just trying to save what we had.
Carlos, don't leave me...
please just talk to me.
I am done with you.
ladies and gentlemen, I present to you Mr. and Mrs. Victor Lang.
I'm sorry!
Mrs. Mccluskey! Enjoy the wedding?
nice. Very classy.
although what the hell was that brouhaha between Carlos and Edie?
I don't know and I don't care.
today, I'm so filled with love, I can forgive anyone anything.
Oh, um, but if you do see them again, call security.
so we're in Zurich, and I sick after breakfast for the third morning in a row.
and I thought to myself, dear god, I hope I have not developed an allergy to chocolate brioche.
life just wouldn't be worth living.
so I said, that's it. We're seeing a doctor.
well, you could've knocked us over with a feather when he said she was already two months pregnant.
Aw, I think it's so great, and we could not be happier for you.
when's your due date?
Oh, not until the early fall, but enough about me.
this is your day... you and Victor who, by the way, I have not met yet.
Oh, my gosh, that's right.
okay, you stay here. I'm gonna go grab him.
it is so good to be back. I can't believe how much is happening.
I mean, you and Gaby getting married, and I'm having a baby.
what's going on with you, Lynette?
nothing, same old, same old.
Really? Is everything okay, sweetie?
cause you haven't quite seemed yourself the last couple weeks.
I'm fine. Everything's just fine.
I'll tell you this much, I'm exhausted.
I'll be glad when this day is over.
well, it was all worth it.
marrying Gaby is the smartest thing you've ever done.
with her bringing in the Latino vote, the governor's mansion's as good as yours.
well, that's assuming I can change her mind.
I had to make certain concessions just to get her down the aisle.
you're the husband now. The rules have changed.
be nice, buy her a few pretty things.
trust me, you'll be able to tame that little spitfire.
I'm not too worried. I've always been able to manage my assets.
did you find him?
no, I'm still looking, but I'll let you know.
Oh, movie's over.
go out and play. Go on, go on. Out!
they're just gonna go play guns.
can I watch another movie?
Oh, Lynette said one was the limit, and she'll be home soon.
no, she won't.
whenever they go out to a party, they always come home at least an hour later than they say they will.
aren't you an observant little monkey?
tell me, sweetie...
would you know anything about a man named Rick?
Yeah, I know Rick.
my daddy and Lynette had a big fight about him.
Really?
sounds like there's maybe a little story there.
if I tell you, could I watch a really good grown-up movie?
if it's a really good grown-up story.
okay, I got you some appetizers to tide you over.
we have mini quiches and beef satay and something called "crystal coast shrimp with grits,"
but it's mostly just grits ' cause I ate all the shrimp on my way over.
Reverend, that was such a beautiful ceremony.
really, just heartfelt and moving... the whole package.
well, thank you. - Yeah, it was really impressive.
so what are you doing tonight?
Oh, Carlos.
didn't know you were in here.
I got a little thirsty.
Yes. I can see that.
Gaby, I am sorry if I ruined your wedding.
but if it's any consolation, I also ruined my life.
what are you talking about?
a couple years ago, I was totally happy.
I had a home, you, a great career.
and I don't understand how I let it all go to hell.
and now here I am, back at square one.
I really blew it.
Ah, what am I doing?
I shouldn't be dumping this on you.
it's your wedding day. Go to victor.
I'm gonna stay right here
well, I don't know how you did it.
the kids are asleep, and the cough syrup hasn't been touched.
boy, you're just waiting for an excuse to give me the boot.
well, if history's any indicator, I won't have to wait long.
so you don't think people can change?
I think at a certain point, people just are who they are.
well, I think people can change.
now take you.
you were the perfect wife and mom...
then along came Rick.
how did you... - come on, Lynette.
you kids were young when I was sneaking around on Glen, but you knew something was up.
you heard about this from my kids?
just the girl, and all she knows is that daddy got mad because Rick "liked"you.
nothing happened between me and Rick.
Yes, he came on to me, but unlike you, I controlled myself.
well, you had Tom to come home to.
I had your stepfather.
Hey, Glen may have bored you, but the years we had a father in that house were the happiest in my life.
you didn't care about that, though, did you? You just drove him away.
and you couldn't wait to pay me back.
do you remember what you said the next year when I got sick?
no, I don't. - Liar.
you said I earned it.
it was god's punishment.
how are you feeling now, Lynette?
you think you're being punished?
how can you say that?
you were so sanctimonious.
you could not imagine what sort of woman could do that kind of thing.
not so hard to imagine now, is it?
stop comparing us. I never did what you did.
no, you just wanted to.
you're leaving tomorrow.
I don't want your money. I don't want you imy house.
Hey. You are sick, Lynette.
you think you know what you're in for 'cause you watched me go through it?
watching it is nothing.
you are going to feel worse than you thought a person could feel, and I'll be holding your hand through every damn minute.
you can't stay if I don't want you here.
you can fight me or you can fight the cancer.
trust me, you won't have the strength to do both.
do young people still say "awesome"? - Not so much.
um, try "off the hook."
"off the hook"? That doesn't even make sense.
fine, type in "groovy."See if I care.
Hello? Hodge residence.
Oh, hi, Danielle. Listen, I am sending Julie Mayer an e-mail from you.
now would you say that your school was "off the hook"?
uh, no. I would say it was sucky or crappyor a freaking nightmare.
look, if you're gonna start complaining, I'm going to hang up.
mom, you have gotto talk to the nuns.
they are so harsh with me, and they have all these stupid rules.
well, perhaps if some of those rules had been in place when you took up with Edie's nephew, you might not be in this little pickle.
mom, please, I just wanna come home.
look, I am gonna say this one last time.
you are gonna stay put until that baby is born.
now don't forget, we're driving up this weekend, and I am bringing your favorite... lemon squares, and
darling... can I draw you a bath?
that would be lovely.
Oh, would you give me a hand, please?
there you go.
it's almost time for the 6-month size.
Oh, don't remind me.
no. No, it's no problem. I can fix that for you.
just, um, give me your name and address.
I'm Mrs. Emmeline Walcott, and I'm at 42 Old Mill road.
all right, I gotta stop and pick up a Douglas Valve, but, uh,
I should be there in 45 minutes tops.
I hate to see you drive when you're this tired.
there's some iced coffee in the fridge.
see you when I get back.
you were great. - did you all ever doubt I would be?
just hurry up and get dressed. We only have 45 minutes.
are you Mike? - Yeah.
I'm looking for a Mrs. Walcott's house.
you've come to the right place.
here, put this on.
you mind telling me what Susan's up to?
ask her yourself.
are you sure about this?
I don't want you to look back and regret not having your perfect wedding.
well, I don't know if you've noticed, but my idea of the perfect wedding keeps changing.
one day, I want white roses, and then I want lilies, and first, I want a harpist, and then a string quartet.
only one thing stays constant...
and I'm looking at him.
why would I need anything else to make my wedding perfect?
well, who knew down sizing could be so romantic?
Yeah. - Uh, Mrs. Walcott, I presume?
that's right, sugar.
Oh, you might wanna check that breast pocket of your suit.
and just so you know, you'll be paying for those and the lights and the flowers.
I've never seen you look so beautiful.
you clean up pretty good yourself.
are we ready? - Are you kidding?
they've been dragging this thing out for three years.
we are gathered here today to join together Mike Delfino and Susan Mayer in matrimony
an honorable estate not to bentered into lightly, but reverently and soberly...
family... there is nothing more important.
they're the ones who show up when we're in trouble...
the ones who push us to succeed...
the ones who help keep our secrets.
but what of those who have no family to rely on?
what happens to those poor souls who have no loved ones to help them in their hour of need?
well...
most learn to walk life's road by themselves.
but a sad few of us...
Simply...stop trying.
Susan and Mike finally tied the knot.
Lynette got some disturbing news.
where the hell do you get off having cancer and not telling me about it?
mom.
Bree returned from her trip.
holy crap!
with a surprise. - There you go.
Gaby married Victor.
Gaby is the smartest thing you've ever done.
with her bringing in the Latino vote, the governor's mansion's as good as yours.
while Carlos.
why are you so reluctant to make a commitment to me?
ended it with Edie.
I am done with you.
but the search for true happiness led to events that were unexpected and distinctly.
desperate.
the first thing you should know is that Edie Britt never actually intended to die, but someone she loved was trying to leave her.
so she planned every detail, from the silk scarf she'd hang by to the suicide note detailing her despair.
now all Edie had to do was wait for her beloved to come home.
Hey, Edie!
I'm here to get my stuff.
you see, to hold on to her man, Edie knew she'd have to find the perfect moment to let go.
Hey, Carlos!
sadly for Edie.
can I talk to you?
her timing was fatally flawed.
Mrs. Mccluskey?
I need to show you something.
come here.
what's this?
those are trash cans.
I know they're trash cans, smart-ass.
I'm asking what they're doing out on a Saturday night when the trash got picked up on Thursday.
fine.
I will take them in.
happy now?
what the hell is that?
and this is how Carlos Solis arrived just in the nick of time to save the life of Edie Britt.
Oh, baby.
what did you do?
come on, you gotta wake up.
come on, please?
of course, had he known what she was about to do to his life.
he would've let her hang there.
there is a certain time of night, after children have been put to bed and husbands have begun snoring, that women lie awake and think of the secrets they've been keeping from their friends.
it might be an impromptu wedding.
or a recently diagnosed tumor.
or a make-believe pregnancy.
regardless, it's all they will think of.
until something comes along to remind them that other people have secrets, too.
how is she? What did the doctors say?
uh, they've got Edie on a ventilator, but she's gonna be okay.
what the hell happened? How could she pull a stunt like this?
uh, she left a note which pretty much blames me.
Oh, sweetie.
I can't believe this is happening.
it's like Mary Alice all over again.
Yes, but the good news is she's gonna live.
I know it's her wedding night, but do you think we should call Gaby?
Oh, crap.
you know, this betr be one hell of a wedding night, considering how long you're taking in there.
trust me, Victor.
this will be a night you'll never forget.
let's get out of here.
what?
I'm serious. You, me-- just screw it all.
let's.
let's run away together.
I just got married.
there are 200 people out there waiting for me to lead a conga line.
Gaby, you just said you don't feel like Victor really loves you, and you know I do. I've never stopped.
I can't dump him on our wedding day.
that's a horrible thing to do, even to Victor.
he'll get over it, but I've never gotten over losing you, and I won't let it happen again!
Gaby, you in here?
I was just counting gifts.
Oh, that's fine. I... I was actually looking for that publicist guy.
you haven't seen him, have you? - Nope.
okay.
I'll give you a holler when I need you.
come on!
who doesn't wear underwear on their wedding day?
Oh, focus, you idiot!
come on. When are we leaving?
so we're doing this?
great.
uh, it'll take me a few hours to get stuff together.
I'm gonna pick you up tonight. Just be packed and ready to go.
okay. Wait!
aren't you gonna kiss the bride?
Finally!
Carlos, where the hell are you?
I'm at the hospital.
Edie tried to kill herself tonight.
Oh, my god! Is she okay?
I found her just in time, but obviously, I can't come pick you up tonight.
okay, that's all right.
I'll just take a cab and meet you.
Gaby, I can't leave Edie now.
look, maybe in a couple weeks.
in a few weeks? What?
No! It has to be tonight!
Victor's in the bedroom right now waiting to consummate.
and Edie's on a ventilator.
look, you don't have to stay with Victor.
you have a house.
okay, you know, running away with you on my wedding night was crazy enough.
but running away to be alone is insane!
Gaby, please, she needs me.
can't you just wait?
No!
I would rather try and work it out with Victor.
Gaby, are you coming to bed?
one month later
happy 1-month anniversary.
I didn't know we were doing this.
well, we've just been so happy the last four weeks, I thought we should celebrate.
you are happy, right?
Yeah.
I've never been happier.
Aw, that's sweet.
I don't believe you.
Susan, I watch you sometimes, and you seem very disconnected, like something's missing.
nothing is missing.
so our life together is exactly how you pictured it?
you've gotten everything you wanted?
Yeah, pretty much.
"pretty much" means there is something that you want that you don't have.
how can I give it to you if you don't tell me what it is?
Susan, I swear, I am ecstatically, beyond my wildest dreams, lip-smackingly happy.
you got it?
this marriage is doomed.
Hey, a moving van just pulled up.
Oh, Andrew, I'm having problems with my strap.
could you help me?
look, I told you three weeks ago I was no longer participating in your little hoax, and that includes strapping you in.
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
Orson, could you come help me, please?
I'll remember this the next time you want money for leather pants.
people are gonna find out, all right?
and then we're gonna all look like idiots.
well, not if we're careful.
this isn't the '50s, okay?
teenage girls get pregnant all the time.
I mean, my ex-lab partner's practically a grandmother.
look, this family's reputation is already hanging by a thread.
I mean, first people thought that your stepfather was a wife killer, then your sister takes up with her history teacher, and now we're supposed to parade a little bastard up and down the street.
we might as well sit on the porch and play banjos.
Bree, you know, there's a moving van next door.
mom, are you awake?
okay, honey.
just give me a minute.
give me a minute.
my wig is gone.
where is it? - It's on the nightstand.
No! No, I'm looking at the nightstand, and all I see are a few stray hairs and this sports blooper DV you thought would cheer me up.
Peyton Manning is funny.
mom!
Hey, I'm coming!
Hey, don't just sit there like a lump!
come on! Help me look!
Oh, god. Honey, this is one of those moments when it occurs to me that wouldn't it be easier if we just told everyone that you have cancer?
I found it.
look, I mean, I get not wanting to scare the kids, but to keep all of our friends in the dark.
look, I can deal with the chemo.
I can deal with people telling me my hair has never looked better.
but what I cannot deal with is the pity, so we are doing it my way.
you were crooked.
Hey, sweetie, what's up?
there's a moving van across the street.
so you want it listed right away?
and don't worry about getting top dollar.
I want this place priced to move.
what's going on here?
I'm meeting with our realtor.
Gaby, you remember Gil.
I remember telling you I wasn't ready to sell the house yet.
Gil, could you give us a minute, please?
Yeah.
Gaby, we agreed that after we got married, you would sell the house.
I still have a lot of stuff here.
well, my house is over 10, 000 square feet.
I'm pretty sure there are closets.
I'm just not in a rush to unload this house, okay?
this was my home. I was very happy here.
but we've got a new home now.
aren't you happy there?
Yeah, it's a great house.
well, good.
then sell this place.
what are you waiting for?
I'm not waiting for anything.
look, a moving van.
new neighbors. What do we know?
well, uh, dining chairs. There's a clue.
Yes. It proves they eat sitting down.
no, I mean they're stickley.
it means they have taste.
and money.
they've been remodeling for weeks.
I wish Edie were here.
without her, there's no one to give us the dish.
yet another illustration of the fundamental selfishness of suicide.
do you think this is them?
Oh, my god. Katherine.
I cannot believe it has been 12 years.
you haven't changed a bit.
well, you clearly have. Your eyesight's going.
how's your aunt?
Katherine used to live here with Mrs. Sims.
not very well, I'm afraid.
that's really the reason why we moved back.
I didn't want poor aunt Lily to spend her final days in a nursing home.
that is so kind of you.
Yeah, it is.
Oh, and as luck would have it, my husband found a job here.
Adam, could you wave or something?
Hello, ladies.
I look forward to meeting you when I'm a little less sweaty.
he's a cutie.
what does he do?
he's a doctor.
okay, don't take this personally, but we hate you.
mom?
I finished unpacking my room.
do you need any help?
Oh, my god.
this is not little Dylan.
I'm Susan, Julie's mom.
she is gonna be so excited to see you.
great.
who's Julie again?
honey, you remember... your best friend when you were little.
Oh, right.
why don't you go help your stepfather with the last few boxes?
it's nice to meet you all.
what a beautiful family.
I feel so lucky to have you for a neighbor.
no, I am the lucky one.
look at my view.
your garden is absolutely breathtaking.
and that pine tree in the backyard.
it's my pride and joy.
Oh, it absolutely kills me to have to ask you to cut it down.
excuse me?
well, I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna be able to grow my prize-winning vegetables with that tree blocking all the sunlight.
Oh, well, I'm... I'm sorry about your vegetables, but that pine shields my view of the Purcells' backyard, and if you had ever seen Mr. Purcell sunbathe, well, you'd know exactly what that tree means to me.
well, I don't want to quarrel.
we will not touch that tree until we have come up with a solution to our problem.
curtains, perhaps.
so you're back.
how fun.
I should have a brunch so that everyone can get to know you.
no, no need.
I'm having a barbecue this Saturday.
I'm inviting the whole neighborhood.
Oh, you don't need to do that.
I insist.
I have missed Wisteria Lane so much, and I wanna do something special for my dear, old friends.
and all you lovely newcomers.
the nice thing about this fake pregnancy is my feet don't swell.
I mean, I'd never be able to squeeze into these sling-backs if I really was 8 12 months pregnant.
don't you look radiant!
well, hello, mrs. Mckeever.
well, I heard that you were expecting, but I had no idea how far along you were.
may I?
there's no need.
the baby's just not kicking right now.
sometimes, if you give them a little jiggle, you can get them to move.
Oh, she doesn't really wanna be jiggled right now.
she's very sensitive down there.
but I'll be gentle.
you know, in my day, mothers thought that it was good luck.
perhaps I need to make my point a little more clearly.
Bree, you're hurting me!
is there a problem here?
no, not at all!
I'm just saying hello to a very dear friend of mine.
are you gonna back off now?
car's here, dear.
lovely to see you, Mrs. Mckeever.
why must old ladies always do that?
I don't know, but you've got to stop roughing them up.
I'm sorry, Susan.
Dr. Gorenberg just had a patient go into labor.
his new partner is covering for him, if you're comfortable with that.
sure.
I'm just here for a checkup.
doctor?
thank you.
I'm Dr. Mayfair.
I'm gonna.
hold it. Have we met?
Yes. Yesterday.
Susan mayer.
your new neighbor.
right.
I... I didn't know you were.
this kind of doctor.
I sure am.
listen, um.
maybe this isn't... - feet up, please.
okay.
and scootch down.
it's just that it's weird, you know, considering you're.
Where'd you go?
and relax.
sorry.
and relax.
sorry.
and relax.
sorry.
um, hey, not to change the subject, but when is Dr. Gorenberg coming back?
almost done.
you know, Katherine has talked about you for years.
it's nice to finally put a face to the name.
Muriel. How are you doing?
what's up?
you look good.
don't try to sweet-talk me, Lynette Scavo.
I am fit to be tied.
did you or did you not volunteer to run the fund-raising gala?
Yeah.
things have been a little weird lately
don't even think of wriggling out of this, Lynette.
every other third grade mom has chaired an event.
it is your turn, okay. I'll jump right on it.
great.
okay.
see.
that's where someone with half a brain would have played the cancer card.
I can handle it.
like hell.
you've been nauseous all day from the chemo.
you shouldn't even be here!
it's my life.
some stupid disease is not gonna keep me from living it.
besides, Parker's expecting to see me.
there.
he saw you.
we'll duck out when the lights go down.
he's gonna be watching for me all day.
he's one of the leads.
he's friar Tuck.
it's a thankless role.
well, everything seems normal.
but you say you've been having irregular periods.
Yeah.
you know, one month off, two months on.
that happens, right?
ever experience night sweats?
um, sometimes.
but Mike's a big spooner.
he's like sleeping with a hibachi.
um, how about hot flashes?
okay, whoa.
I'm gonna stop you right there.
I am way too young for that. Please refer to your chart.
Susan, I know for a lot of women the word "menopause" has negative connotations.
they hear, um,"aging," "brittle bones," um,"loss of sexual desire."
okay, before we go any further, can I check those diplomas?
cause I would just like to make sure that they're not from some med school in the Philippines.
look, there's a simple blood test we can use to find out.
I don't need any test!
I am not old enough for menopause.
now I don't know what kind of nonsense they taught you at.
harvard Medical School, class of.'97?
Oh, my god!
I am old!
just give me the damn test.
we will live in these woods till our work is done.
if the sheriff comes, we will drive him away with our bows and arrows.
you okay?
I'm feeling a little.
God save all ye merry men!
I beseech thee!
pray that I may join your man, band of merry men.
I am more than just a jolly friar, for I can have both a sword and an arrow!
we must support Robin Hood.
Oh, I'm gonna be sick!
right there with you, lady.
all hail Robin Hood!
okay, let's go.
No! It's too late!
Bravo!
I'm sorry.
I'll get you a new purse.
fine, but that wasn't my purse.
hello. You have everything you need?
you just let me know. Hi! Good to see you!
Oh, you look great!
Mrs. Mccluskey. Hello.
how are you? Do you remember me?
you're Bess Truman, right? Of course I remember you.
if that's your way of checking if my brain's gone all tapioca, I'm fine.
sorry.
so I saw your kid and your new husband. Nice catch.
Oh. Well, thank you.
I'm very eager for him to experience life on Wisteria Lane.
the times that Dylan and I spent here were the happiest of our lives.
yeah? Then why'd you take off so suddenly?
you skipped town without even saying good-bye.
my, you do remember a lot, don't you?
excuse me. Really must mingle.
I think these eggs are past their prime.
so you just shun them and throw them away.
well, yeah, since mayonnaise left out in the sun can kill ya.
everything okay? You seem kinda moody today.
Yeah, get used to it.
okay, did I do something wrong? No. I'm sorry.
I'm just a little.
you know what? Forget it.
let's eat.
Yoo-hoo, Susan! We saved you a place!
come on! We want you over here. Come on.
Oh, my god! Dylan!
Hi.
it's me, Julie.
Julie's the one we were talking about.
Hi, honey! - Hi!
she was your best friend.
Yeah, and I... I brought you a little welcome back gift. Your favorite.
Oh, my goodness.
you remember how much you used to love licorice?
I did?
okay.
come on. I've got some of the old gang I want you to meet.
have fun!
menopause?
aren't you a little young for that?
I know.
and you thought you married a vibrant woman in her prime, and instead, you got a wife who's dry and dusty.
Oh, honey.
no, it's... it's a natural part of life.
Yeah, the part before death. Oh!
look, I know that it's upsetting, but it's really not that big a deal.
Yes, it is! What if you wanna have kids?
we agreed that we didn't.
no, you said you did.
I said I didn't, then you changed your mind.
what if you change it back?
that's not gonna happen.
listen, my last egg could be on its way down the chute at this very moment.
if you wanna have kids, you might wanna jump on it right now.
all right, this is all very romantic, but let me be clear about this, okay?
I love you, and if kids don't happen, I'm fine with that.
I don't want you to be fine.
I want you to be happy.
all right, I'm just trying to find a nice way to shut you up, so.
Yep, we're doomed.
Hey. Hey, look who's back.
Oh, my gosh. She's out of the clinic.
Thanks, darling.
Hi! - Hi!
how are you?
Oh, careful... the neck. - Oh, sorry.
thank you all so much for the cards.
sometimes it takes a near tragedy to realize just how much you're loved.
so why don't you talk to your friends, and I'll go unpack the car?
Oh, thanks, sweetheart.
I have to admit that I was a little concerned about how you'd react when you saw me.
but this, throwing me a party?
well, we just all love ya.
and, Edie, you look great. Especially.
you know, given the circumstances.
you mean that I tried to hang myself.
it's okay.
the doctor encouraged me to talk about it.
surely not over food.
well, Carlos and I talk about it all the time.
you know, and this whole thing has just brought us closer together.
we've actually talked about marriage.
hello. I don't think we've met.
I'm Katherine Mayfair, your new neighbor.
Oh, Edie. It's a pleasure to meet you.
welcome to my party.
so I hear congratulations are in order.
Edie just announced you're getting married.
best wishes!
we're not engaged.
that was just a kind of a what if conversation.
Really? Because she thinks you're getting married.
everyone else thinks you're getting married.
so, again, best wishes.
Gaby, the woman tried to kill herself because I left her.
she's not real good with disappointment.
neither am I!
you told me you wanna run away together, and then I don't hear from you for a month!
that was only because I was going through stuff with Edie, but it doesn't mean that I wasn't thinking about you constantly.
you were not.
Yes, I was.
every second of every day.
Yeah, well, I.
kind of thought about you, too.
I need to be with you, Gaby. - Yeah?
prove it.
can you get away tonight?
Oh, my god, are you serious?
damn right I am.
I just have to be back by midnight to give Edie her pills.
what?
if we're gonna have an affair, we've gotta be discreet.
affair?
I thought we were talking about runng away together.
I can't do that.
Edie's too fragile right now.
that old battle-ax is gonna outlive us all!
Hey, don't talk about her like that.
Oh, far be it for me to speak ill of the future Mrs. Carlos Solis.
we are not getting married!
best wishes!
no. Absolutely not.
that's my final answer.
well, talk to you later.
that was danielle.
now she wants us to send a DVD player for her room.
well, that hardly seems extravagant.
you're missing the point! It's a convent, not the four seasons.
you have mustard on your chin.
I mean, it's one thing to forgive bad behavior. It's another thing to reward it.
there are consequences for her mistakes.
Bree! Oh, my god!
are you all right?
Oh! No, no, I'm fine! I'm fine!
you're bleeding! - No, no, no!
it's just, uh... oh, it's a little barbecue sauce.
where is Katherine's husband?
he's a doctor. - She's fine.
get over here right now!
Bree got stabbed in the belly!
Oh, my god, are you all right? Let me take a look.
no, it's nothing!
Ah, uh, we were just teasing ida.
it's something we do. - Yes.
look, it's a trick ba... barbecue fork.
we got it at a magic shop.
uh, see? Retractable!
Oh, my baby!
that's quite a trick.
Hey, let's go freak out Mrs. Mccluskey.
he's such a scamp.
psycho mom at 5: 00.
you say the word, she gets a face full of pig bones.
Aw, my hero.
I can handle her.
I just spoke with Helen, and imagine my surprise when she told me that you'd not started on the decorations for the gala.
I'm in charge of decorations?
Yes, which you would've known had you bothered to pick up the packet.
I don't want to hear it.
okay.
piggyback, mommy.
I'm sorry, sweetie.
I'm just... I'm just too tired right now.
here, honey, I'll get ya.
Yes!
mommy has to conserve her energy for more important things.
we are not throwing in the towel over a minor mishap.
how many more mishaps are we gonna get away with?
yesterday, it was an old woman in the Macy's shoe department.
today, a magic fork in the belly.
pretty soon, this whole charade will completely unravel, and we will be humiliated.
we're already in too deep.
we could go on a trip, tell people you miscarried while we were away.
and then what would happen to the baby?
well, Danielle would keep it.
you think Danielle could raise this child?
Orson, you've seen her in action.
She'... she's shallow, and she's... she's selfish!
she would ruin this child's life!
how can you say that?
because I'm her mother.
and I know what I've created, and that's the real humiliation.
is child deserves better.
and I know what to do now. Please.
please let me try.
so.
really, what you want is a second chance?
well, would that be so horrible?
well, then.
let the charade continue.
so you're bailing on me now? - I know.
the timing is terrible. - Damn right!
it's three weeks before the gala.
I just didn't realize how tired I would be when I took this on.
Oh, we're all tired, Lynette.
but some of us still manage to honor our commitments.
okay, I'm gonna be honest with you.
I haven't been feeling that great lately. - Oh, don't whine to me about your aches and pains.
I've had the sammigraine since '87.
and my knee's so bad, I can't even use the treadmill anymore.
Yeah.
that's rough.
by the way.
I have cancer.
I'll give Helen a call.
so I am halfway through chemo, and my doctor is very confident that I'm going to beat this, so you can all relax.
I'm not going to die.
well, not unless we kill you.
damn it, Lynette. What did we say after Mary Alice.
after Edie? Why didn't they tell us?
we're your friends. Why would you shut us out?
I just liked being able to throw on my wig and join you guys for a cup of coffee and a good gossip about the new neighbors.
you know, for five minutes, I could pretend I wasn't a sick person.
but once your friends know you're sick, you can't pretend anymore 'cause you can see it in their eyes the fear, the pity.
is that all you see in our eyes?
no. No, of course not.
you know what? Let's make a pact.
no more secrets.
from now on, we tell each other every shocking detail of our lives.
I'm in. - Me, too.
you with us?
Absolutely.
no more secrets.
you're right. I'm not happy. Let's talk.
all I'm saying is I just wanna know that I come first with you.
sometimes I feel less like your wife than a possession.
it's demeaning. It's--it's.
why are you smiling right now?
because this is fantastic.
after weeks of shutting me out, you're finally telling me how you feel.
we should do this all the time.
well, it's hard when you're so busy.
maybe we should go away and just take a couple weeks or a month.
let's rediscover what it was that made us fall in love to begin with.
that is a great idea. Let's do it.
how's next week?
let's see here.
well, I've got the meeting with the school board on Tuesday.
and the end of the month, I've got that conference in Washington... oh, shoot.
I've got the groundbreaking for the new civic center.
dad's birthday.
economic development forum.
how about April?
I can give you two whole weeks in April.
I'll see you later, babe.
where you going?
to Scavo's for a few beers.
can I come?
no. - Why not?
Edie, I know you've been through a lot lately, but I can't hold your hand 24 hours a day.
if you want this relationship to work, you gotta give me some downtime.
okay, so I managed to get away from Edie.
what do you want?
to get you away from Edie.
Oh, come on. You have to remember your boyfriend Joey Miller.
you used to chase him around the jungle gym.
Really?
you'd think I would've gone for this guy with the sexy finger up his nose.
so you don't remember any of the kids we used to play with?
no.
to be honest, I don't remember anything about living here.
Really?
so, what is your earliest memory?
I don't know if this is a memory, but.
for years, I've had this creepy dream.
I'm really little, and there's a guy in my room, and he tries to grab me.
that is creepy.
have... have you ever talked to somebody about it?
you mean like a therapist?
my old babysitter suggested that, but my mom got mad and said no.
Really? - Yeah.
then she fired the babysitter.
Susan? - I'm in here.
uh, your front door was open.
no problem.
um, what's up?
first, let me just say this is one of the more embarrassing moments of my career, and you have every right to hate me.
Adam, I have no idea what you're talking about.
well, your test results came back, and your estrogen levels are fine.
you're not about to start menopause.
Really? That's fantastic!
there's more. - More?
you're pregnant.
what? Wh... what did he just say?
I'm pregnant?
he said I'm pregnant.
I have never been happier.
well, now I believe you.
there you are.
I'm sorry.
I got in late last night. I didn't want to wake you.
you don't have to explain.
I trust you.
well, good. You should.
I just wish you trusted me a bit more.
what are you talking about?
why didn't you ever tell me about your offshore bank account?
what?
well, you know, the one in the Cayman Islands with $10 million in it.
I miss you when you're gone.
going through your things makes me feel like you're with me.
okay, um, I know how this looks.
what did you think I was gonna do?
tell people?
turn you in? Try to get my little hands on it?
I don't care about money, Carlos.
all I care about is you.
that's why this relationship is going to work.
you can trust me with your secrets, just like I can trust you not to hurt me.
there is a certain time of morning.
it occurs after kids have left for school and husbands have headed off for work.
it's a time when women think of the secrets they've been keeping from their friends.
and how shocked they would be if the truth was discovered.
and how they'll do everything in their power to keep that from happening.
but what of those lucky women who have no secrets left to keep?
what do they think about every morning?
Hey!
is something wrong?
it's just Dylan and I used to be best friends.
I mean, we did everything together.
I know. She was like a sister to you.
well.
that girl that I've been hanging out with.
and I know this is gonna sound crazy, but.
that's not the same girl.
these women spend their mornings thinking of their neighbors and the secrets. They may be keeping.
there you are. I've been calling you.
is this the room? - Yes.
Dylan's been asking me if she can move in here.
so let her.
you may remember what happened here, but she can't.
doesn't matter.
I won't allow it - Hey, you okay?
did we make a mistake coming back here?
did we have a choice?
Lynette dallied with temptation...
are you sleeping with my wife?
Carlos struggled with his new life...
I am poor, and I am blind, and there is nothing about that that is your type.
Bree found herself with a new rival...
Bree, that is, like, the best pie you've ever made.
this is not my pie.
okay, you caught me. It's mine.
and Susan made the best of having houseguests.
Oh, and, listen, Bob and lee introduced us to this wonderful contractor, so we won't be imposing for long.
imposing? Who's imposing?
you can stay as long as you want.
a man is only as sick as his secrets
in a corridor of the Greenwood Rehabilitation Center is a sign.
it's there to remind patients to be honest about the past.
but Orson Hodge did not notice it.
he was too busy thinking of the past, or at least the part of it he shared with Mike Delfino.
Orson thought of the night they met
the night his mother...
had murdered his mistress.
he thought of the next time they met and how Mike began to recognize him.
he thought of his mother's fear Mike would remember too much and her demand that Orson stop this from happening.
he thought of how he agonized, but in the end, had still...
done the unthinkable.
Orson then started to think about the message he had received from Mike, asking him to visit.
the thought was crossing Orson's mind that Mike had remembered something
something dangerous, when suddenly...
Orson. Come on in.
the time for thinking was over.
so I-I see they have a tennis court here.
must be nice to get out and watch a few balls around, huh?
why don't you sit down?
it might make this easier.
I've been trying to figure out all day just how I was gonna do this.
do what, Mike?
since I've come here, I've had a lot of time to think.
things are... becoming clearer.
I'm starting to put some things together.
well, good for you.
no, not really, Orson.
when you hurt people, you gotta be accountable.
there's no way around it.
so I have to ask you...
do you think you can forgive me?
what?
when I asked you to write a prescription for pain pills, it...
all I could think about was getting my next fix.
the fact that you could have lost your license, your business
all that never even entered my head.
and I am... really sorry.
of course. No need to apologize.
I-I feel a million times better.
you know, one thing I've learned here
if you don't get this stuff off your chest, it'll eat you alive.
as he left, Orson thought only of his good fortune and relief, ignoring completely the feelings of guilt and shame that were rising within him.
that was the sad thing about Orson Hodge...
a man is only as sick as his secrects
he had no idea just how sick he really was.
from the moment his doctors had told him he was blind, Carlos Solis had worried about only one thing
that the people in his life would come to see him as a burden.
but as it turned out, his friends didn't mind driving him to the store.
his neighbors didn't mind helping retrieve his mail.
the paper boy didn't mind helping him find his morning paper.
in truth, everyone on Wisteria lane was more than willing to help Caos adjust to life as a blind man
everyone, that is...but his wife, who was quickly starting to feel she was the one with the handicap.
and in a surprise move, the Spurs announced a trade that will send perennial all-star to the...
Oh, jeez, Gaby.
I asked you to please fish out all the little carrot squares.
I did.
well, I think you missed some. Could you get 'em out, please?
there you go. All gone.
did you just use your hand?
of course not. I use a spoon.
I'm sorry that I'm such a handful.
I really am trying to do the best that I can.
I know you are, babe.
and I know it's hard, and I'm gonna try to be more sensitive to your needs.
now hurry up and finish. I have to go to the store.
could I go, too? I'm bored.
Oh, please, Carlos.
I have a million errands to run, and I'd do it a lot faster without you.
plus I'm having lunch with the girls first.
Oh, okay.
Gaby, another carrot.
just eat them. Carrots are good for your...
just eat them.
sorry I'm late. Blind husband. You know the drill.
Oh, Gaby, I'm so glad you're here.
I was just about to tell everyone to keep an eye out for their invitation to the founder's ball.
I'm sorry. What is the founder's ball? You all seem so excited.
it's a black-tie fund-raiser that Bree organizes every year.
it's a lot of work, exhausting and completely worth it.
especially when you get your big moment in the spotlight.
Bree gets to present an award to somebody who's done something extraordinary for the community.
Ooh, I say we nominate the woman who gives Edie her bikini wax.
so, Bree, I've planned a few events myself back in Chicago.
small potatoes compared to this, I'm sure, but if you could use me, I'd love to help.
that would be lovely.
it would?
Yes, of course. Why wouldn't it?
nobody? Okay, I'm going in.
because you two would kill each other... literally.
it'll start with hair pulling and end with detectives taking our statements.
remember the pie thing?
remember the pie thing-- tibetan monks remember the pie thing.
I acknowledge that katherine and I have had our differences, but we have all been through a lot recently.
and I would hope that it taught us to put our differences aside and be friends, because that's what's most important.
I faced cancer and a tornado, but I'm running from this.
Oh, my god. Rick.
how are you?
great, actually. We're great.
well, you look great.
Hey, Tom. Look who's here-- Rick.
I see that. Table for one?
uh, no, thanks. I just wanted to come by and bring you guys...
it's barolo. I just got back from Italy.
Oh, well, that's nice. Thank you.
Ah, what's the occasion? Or are you just being a good guy?
I can't get anything past you, huh, Tom?
well, I... I've got some work to do.
Yeah, well, you know, I wanted to come here and tell you guys in person.
I'm opening my own place.
uh, you must have seen it.
that's you? - On the corner?
Yeah, I looked everywhere, I swear.
but, uh, it was the best location.
I'll bet.
okay, look, people like to eat in Fairview.
there's plenty of business for both of us.
Hey, I remember you! You back to working here now?
Oh, no. Sorry.
too bad. That osso buco of yours was-- really something.
well, I got it on the menu at my new place on the corner.
come check us out.
see? Room for everyone.
Orson, you scared me.
why are you sitting down here in the dark?
and aren't you a little cold?
I had to do something.
then you came down here and you couldn't remember what it was.
that happens to me all the time.
well, the baby is insisting that
I eat the last piece of Bree's triple-chocolate cake.
if you want, we could
Oh, my god. You're naked!
in my kitchen where I eat.
okay, I don't hear you leaving.
I had to do something.
Pajamas-- that's something you could do.
okay, you're right.
you're a guest in my house-- a completely naked guest in my house.
I should leave.
you were supposed to be home at 8: 00 to help me wrangle the kids for bath time.
it's-- it's almost 11: 00.
sorry.
so where were you?
you were stewing, weren't you?
come on. You're upset about Rick.
look. I'm not gonna deny I was ticked off when I saw him.
but I'm over it. I'm taking this as a challenge.
we are gonna up our game. - Oh, yeah?
Yep. You know what I did tonight?
I worked on our menu. We are gonna start making our own osso buco.
I got a recipe that is gonna kick his ass.
so you're really okay with this? - Yeah, I'm great.
look at how cute you are.
it's growing back fast, huh?
Yeah, it's back.
morning, Susan.
good morning.
love what you're wearing.
Oh, I hope this isn't decaf. Got a big day ahead of me.
all right. We don't need to talk about it.
just promise me it won't happen again.
what won't happen again?
Orson, you were naked in this kitchen last night.
I was not.
you most certainly were.
good morning. What's going on?
well, Susan claims she saw me last night au naturel.
it wasn't a claim.
he was sitting right here without a stitch of clothing on, and I couldn't have cake.
Oh, I think I know what's going on.
somebody had a naughty dream.
Susan, I'm blushing.
no, no, no, no. No, I did not have a sex dream.
Susan, it's perfectly understandable.
Mike's away. You're feeling a little lonely.
naturally, you'd project those feelings onto the nearest available sex machine.
you are such a scamp.
I know when I'm dreaming, and this really happened.
why else would I be sponging butt prints off my stool?
you know, Susan, sometimes I climb into a warm bath with a romance novel.
just a thought.
Gaby, since when do you come to price warehouse?
I'm poor now. Remember?
I have to mingle with the unwashed masses.
what are you doing here?
Oh, I've been unwashed for years.
this place is huge!
would it kill them to have valet parking?
Gaby, people don't come here for the amenities.
they come because toilet paper's 3 cents a ton.
look at all these handicapped spots. I mean, what a waste.
take that guy selling oranges, put him in a vest, stick him under an umbrella, and bam!
you got valet parking.
I don't know why poor people refuse to better themselves.
Yeah, we're crazy that way.
I don't know why you're complaining about handicapped spaces.
doesn't Carlos have one of those blue placards?
no, I think you have to have a wheelchair to get one of those.
no, I'm pretty sure the blind qualify, too.
mom, can I take some of these cookies up to Julie?
why don't you offer some to our guest first?
Oh, no, thank you. We have so much ground to cover.
now let's move on to the flowers.
uh, last year, we went with a cascade of pink and white roses. There it is.
exquisite.
well, easy enough. Let's just do that again, then. Next?
well...
if you have a different idea, I would love to hear that, too.
well, I was thinking it might be nice to do something more unusual.
what about an arrangement of purple lisianthus with a spray of dark berries?
it's interesting. I can't really picture that though.
well, let me help you.
I keep scrapbooks, too.
my mom and Mrs.Hodge are still talking about that ball thing.
she wants me to be a part of the founder's court or whatever they call it.
like I want to put on a stupid white dress and greet people all night.
I know. It's so pathetic.
by the way, I'm doing it.
Seriously? Why?
because I did it last year, and it's actually kind of hilarious and great.
it is!
it doesn't sound great. It sounds beyond lame.
I don't want this to come off the wrong way, but you're a buzz kill.
okay, you spend all of your time cooped up in here alone, obsessing over some mysterious thing that maybe happened to your real dad or maybe didn't.
look, I'm not saying don't obsess.
I'm just saying maybe you could spare some time to have a little fun with your friend, too.
so this founder's thing-- it'll be fun?
uh, these were the centerpieces from the Vanover Medical Center benefit.
the donors were blown away.
well, they're certainly... assertive. My only fear is
I know. I know.
Fairview is a bit more provincial compared to Chicago, but I think you'll find the people here have a lot more taste than you give them credit for.
well, perhaps I could try something new.
let's go with the lisianthus.
look at you! Pronouncing it right the very first time.
isn't learning fun?
Mrs. Scavo? - Uh, yes.
is your husband home? We're investigating an incident involving vandalism.
vandalism?
porter! Preston! Get over here!
no, ma'am. This incident occurred two nights ago near your Pizzeria.
someone threw a brick through a window of a new restaurant-- a place called Rick's?
what?
we're asking everybody who works in the area if they saw anything suspicious.
I didn't go into work that night.
I did, but, um, I didn't see anything. What time did it happen?
the alarm went off at about 10: 45
Oh, I was home way before then, around 8: 00.
I came home early to help you wrangle the kids for bath time.
Yeah. No, he was here.
all right, well, if you do happen to hear anything, could you give us a call, please?
Absolutely. - Thank you.
Oh, oh, hey, honey. Could you hold back a sec?
Nope. Uh, lunch rush I'm already late as it is, okay? See ya.
parking ONLY
excuse me, Miss.
Oh, hey there.
I guess you didn't see that big blue sign.
this is handicapped parking.
I know. Primo spot, isn't it?
what? I have a thingy.
Yeah, I noticed that.
you don't look handicapped to me.
I'm not. My husband is. He's blind.
well, then that placard's for him.
only he can park here.
and how is he gonna park a car if he can't see?
feeling pretty stupid now, aren't ya?
lady, you got a lot of nerve.
I had to park next to the dumpster way in the back.
Oh, don't play victim with me.
I have to walk in heels all day long.
you get to sit in a chair and roll.
you did not just say that!
you know, the quicker I can run my errands, the faster I can get home to my husband, who needs me, because that's the kind of person I am.
W-what are you doing?
calling the cops. You're getting a ticket.
like hell I am! Give me that.
get off!
No! You started it. Hang it up!
get off! - Hang it up!
is there a problem here?
jeez. What, is there a telethon going on around here?
dude, she took one of our spots.
bitch! I had to find street parking.
Hey, there's a security guard over there. Go get him.
no, no, no, no, no. Wait!
okay, you know what? This is getting ridiculous.
Oh, no, no. You're not going anywhere.
let me go!
well, it's official. I'm going to hell.
Hi, daddy.
Hey, guys, would you go play in the back for a while?
I need to talk to your dad. Thanks.
don't they have soccer today?
let me answer that question with another question.
why did you lie to police? - Lynette
and you made me lie to them, too, which brings up another question.
did you know that perjury is, like, this whole big thing?
I think you're overreacting.
no, overreacting would be if I threw a brick through you.
what were you thinking?
help me understand.
I just went to go check out how the construction was going, but I came around the corner.
I saw this giant picture window that says "Rick's."
and then I realize I'm gonna have to see that guy's name every damn day of my life.
then I noticed this pile of bricks.
okay.
I know this whole thing with Rick-- it really caused us some damage.
I know it hurt us, but we survived it, and it's over now.
now that's the thing, Lynette.
it's not over. It was never over.
I don't care about Rick's stupid restaurant!
I don't even care that he wants to steal you from me!
of course, he would want to steal you from me.
that makes sense to me.
I care that he made you act like it could be done.
Oh, Tom.
he changed the way I look at you.
but... nothing ever happened between us.
you have to believe me. Come on!
I am not trying to get you to apologize.
I'm just explaining the brick.
Oh, my god.
you thought I was crazy, but it wasn't a dream.
you're naked!
and that means you're crazy.
I didn't mean to do it.
Oh, really?
you just happened to stumble naked into my front yard?
I didn't mean it, Mike.
"Mike"? Wait.
are you sleepwalking?
Hello?
did you just hit me?
Oh, dear god!
Orson, you're staying at my house!
there you go.
I have no explanation.
this doesn't happen to me.
I don't sleepwalk.
you know, it's none of my business, but seeing as I have seen you naked twice in the week,
I think I can ask, is something bothering you?
I don't think so.
I mean, being out of our house has been a little weird, but I'm very comfortable here.
clearly.
you know, when you were out on the lawn, you said something about Mike.
what, uh, what did I say?
well, it was just sort of muttering.
were you having a dream about him?
no. I- I don't believe so.
well, maybe it's because you just saw him.
he must be on your mind.
Yeah, yeah. You know what, Susan?
I- I think it's time for us to move out.
you can't. Your house isn't finished yet.
no, the downstairs will be ready next week.
we'll be fine.
well, if you insist...
I think it will be for the best.
okay, but in the meantime, um, I do have a teenage daughter, so if you could...
boxers?
Yes.
Thanks.
come on.
you've been cooped up in this house since you got home from the hospital.
let's go out and have some fun!
no, I think I'm gonna stay here.
I don't-- I don't wanna be a burden.
Carlos, I see handicapped people out and about all the time.
in fact, I met two feisty men in wheelchairs yesterday at the mall.
they were living their lives...
so it's time for you to live yours.
come on.
come on.
I'm just dropping off a few letters.
you might as well just wait here.
just picking up some vitamins.
I'll be quicker if I do it myself.
I just have to drop off a gift to my manicurist.
why don't you listen to the radio?
thank you.
sorry, babe.
that took a little longer than I...
Oh, there you are.
Thanks, Henry.
where the hell have you been?
I was starving, so I got that kid to take me to go get a burger.
I don't believe this. I was worried sick about you!
I'm sick of waiting here!
you promised me a fun day, and all I got is a sunburn on the right side of my face.
I'm sorry.
I told you, I had errands to run first.
what's that smell?
what smell?
it smells like...
nail polish.
did you get your nails done?
is that what you've been doing?
excuse me.
miss!
is that your Aston Martin in the handicapped space?
what?
Gaby, are you parked in a handicapped spot?
move it along, pops.
we're gonna be here a while.
wait, wait, wait.
did you get a handicapped tag?
to answer your earlier question, yes, I got a manicure.
I'm sorry.
are we good?
Oh, my god!
you're exploiting my blindness so that you can score better parking?
that's a really mean way to put it.
you had me out here, sitting like a dog with the window cracked open.
you used me!
well, why shouldn't I get something out of this?
you know, the blindness didn't just happen to you.
you can't be serious.
Oh, you bet I am!
every morning, the toothpaste has to be to the left of the sink, because if it's not, you can't find it, and I have to put it there.
and--and sometimes-- I don't know--I'm driving, or I'm in line at the bank and I think, is the toothpaste there?
so then I have to run home and check because I don't want you reaching for the tube and not being able to find it.
I just didn't think this was how it was all gonna turn out, Carlos.
I didn't think that every day for the rest of my life, a part of me is always gonna think, where's the toothpaste?
can't you just leave it in the drawer?
that's not the point, you blind idiot!
I'm saying if all I get in exchange for this crappy situation is a nice parking spot for my $8 manicure, then I'm taking it!
who put pear slices in the Waldorf salad?
guess that would be me.
Katherine, a Waldorf salad is made with apples.
it's tradition.
Yes, a musty, 19th century tradition in need of some jazzing up.
look, I just thought you have so much on your mind already, what with the music and the decorations.
the least I could do was take over the food.
take over?
what in god's name have you done with my French onion soup?
Oh, it'll be fine.
I told the chef nothing is to leave that kitchen unless I've tasted it.
Katherine--- trust me.
after all, I've gotten tons of compliments on the lisianthus.
here, honey.
let me.
Thanks.
you're welcome.
just so you know...
I'm sorry for what I'm putting you through.
if it were alone but you, it wouldn't be worth it.
you ready to go to the party?
you tell me.
how do I look?
you look very handsome.
thank you.
and you look more beautiful than ever.
how do you know that?
just a hunch.
bup, bup, bup!
don't eat that.
we had a refrigeration problem, and I don't want you getting sick.
Oh, dear. Well, I should throw this dip out.
Thanks. It'll be about ten minutes before I can make up a new batch.
do you mind telling your boss?
she's not my boss!
Bree! The room is simply lovely.
you've outdone yourself.
thank you, Mrs. Downing.
listen, when I present the founder's award tonight, I was wondering
Oh, dear.
has no one spoken to you?
about what?
uh, well...
the committee has decided that it would be best if Katherine Mayfair present the award this year.
No! That's...
that's my job.
I always do it.
Oh, well, you're already doing so much, and, well, Katherine was quite insistent.
what's that?
Oh, it's dip. The caterer just said that
I thought we agreed.
nothing leaves the kitchen without me tasting it first.
dig in.
is everyone having fun?
you and Kathere did an amazing job.
boy, we didn't think you guys could work together.
Yeah, we were sure one of you would end up killing the other.
you really should have more faith in people.
excuse me.
Katherine, darling, are you okay?
not really.
I hope there'something wrong with the food.
is anybody else getting sick?
Oh, no.
no, dear. Just you.
maybe you should go home.
I can't.
I have to present the founder's award.
Oh, no one would expect you to do that in your condition.
you know what? Um, I could do it.
no. I can get it together.
Katherine, no one expects you to be a martyr.
why don't you go home?
I can't.
why not?
I'm perfectly capable of presenting.
I've done it for the last eight years.
I mean, no one wants to accept an award from a woman who looks like she should be in line at the needle exchange.
this is important to me.
I'll be fine.
and now for the presentation for the founder's award
ms. Katherine Mayfair.
thank you, Mrs. Downing.
I was honored when you and the other members of the committee asked me to present this award.
Bree, what's up?
I thought giving out this award was your thing.
used to be. Not anymore.
things change.
this year's founder's award...
ever since I started working with that obnoxious backstabber, she's done nothing but try to take the spotlight off of me and put it onto her.
goes to my dear friend...
the obnoxious backstabber just called your name.
Bree has been a pillar of the Fairview community for many years.
there is no better friend than Bree Hodge.
Congratulations.
I know you tried to poison me.
well, uh, this has been an evening full of, um...
surprises.
I never would've imagined that, um, I would be recognized by this wonderful organization ...
Hi, Andrew.
guess what?
your mom just won the founder's award.
Lynette, listen to me.
Oh, my god.
you're not gonna believe what's going on down here.
what? What? Is everyone okay?
uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We're--we're fine.
it's Rick's place-- totally went up in flames.
there, uh, there are, like, three fire trucks here.
Oh, my god! That's horrible!
how did it start?
I--they--they don't know.
okay, I-I'm gonna--I'll call you back in about five.
Bye.
I certainly, uh, wasn't expecting it.
the photographer's asking if he can get shots of the two of us.
wait. I need to talk to you first.
I misunderstood the situation, that's all.
can we just leave it at that?
no, we can't.
and do you know why?
because I thought things were going well.
I was having fun with you.
obviously...
I misunderstood.
so tell me, was there a straw that broke the camel's back?
or were you planning on killing me all along?
here's the thing you need to understand about me and my friends.
we each have our niche.
Gabrielle's the glamorous one.
Susan's the adorable one.
Lynette's smart.
Edie's...Edie.
and I'm the domestic one, the organizer
the one who knows that there are three tines on a dessert fork.
I'm the one who gets teased for that.
that's who I am.
and that's also who you are.
so?
so...
I don't really know how to be friends with you.
that's a shame...
because I understand you better than all those other women do.
I know how following the rules and observing the little graces makes you feel like you're in control.
we've both had days where it was either set a beautiful table or curl up in a ball and die.
we're the same, Bree.
and if you think that means we can't be friends, then I'm sorry.
but it might also mean we could be best friends.
who knew you were so insightful?
isn't learning fun?
terrific, everyone.
thank you.
pictures.
so...
did I lie?
was it cool?
you were right.
it really was.
thank you, Julie.
it's good to get out of my own head, you know?
for months now, I've been hung up on looking for my dad and blaming my mom...
and it's gotten me nowhere.
I just wanna start having fun again.
thank you, Julie.
there you are.
we wanted to get some pictures with you.
listen, I-I have a 12: 00 curfew, so if my mom asks, can you just
no, it's Julie.
Oh, you're sleepwalking.
Yeah, I heard about that.
I'm sorry, Mike.
again, not Mike.
why don't I-I get you back to bed, and--and you can
I'm sorry I ran you over, Mike.
it's an affliction that prevents people from seeing what is right in front of them...
like the wives who can't detect the jealousy that consumes their husbands...
the women unable to see that a rival might also be a friend...
the men who stay oblivious to the guilt that lies deep within them.
yes...
the world is filled with those who cannot see.
the most dangerous are the ones who stay blind to the evil within their own hearts.
how do we protect ourselves from these people?
first, we have to open our own eyes and find them before they find us。
five years ago, Susan delfino gave birth to a son in delivery room "A" of fairview memorial hospital.
moments later, Lila Dash gave birth to a daughter in delivery room "B.
around 10: 00 the next morning, as the two new mothers were leaving the hospital, they nearly ran into each other.
of course, they never knew this.
in fact, Susan and Lila would have been surprised to know how often their paths would cross over the years.
they almost met at the local coffee shop...
and another time at their veterinarian's office...
and again in the bleachers of the fairview flyers.
but despite these close calls, susan and lila never met...
until one tuesday, when susan decided to take her husband to a fancy restaurant for their anniversary...
at the same time, Lila decided to take her daughter to buy somice cream.
that was the night that Susan delfino and Lila Dash finally ran into each other.
it will happen to all of us eventually.
the moment will come when we ask ourselves...
where did the time go?
how did the children I once cradled...
grow up so very quickly?
how did the life I dreamt of...
turn into a career I never expected?
and how did that woman I saw each day in the mirror...
become someone I don't even recognize?
Juanita, this dress is awfully tight.
I don't think you can get into it.
no, it's pretty. I can do it.
how's that one fit?
Oh, I think we're gonna need the next size up.
uh, there is no next size up.
they don't make princess dresses for girls over 7.
she's only 4 1/2.
look, my daughter was invited to a princess party, so I can't let her be the only girl there without a princess dress.
did you try the costume section?
I bet they'd have a mrs. Shrek dress that would fit her.
Juanita, take off the dress! We're going.
No! I can do it.
look, I feel for you.
my niece also has a weight problem.
my daughter does not have a weight problem.
she has a little baby fat, that's all.
in fact, the only problem she has is this store being completely unprepared for a perfectly average 4-year-old girl.
just ring it up.
no, no, no!
Oh, for god sakes. What's wrong now?
once again, the concept is, sweetie, you're taking the pie out of the oven, your face aglow with surprise.
why am I surprised?
because it turned out so perfectly.
well, that's no surprise. My pies are always perfect.
all right. It's your best pie ever. You've topped yourself.
and I know this before I've tasted it?
sweetie, just make whatever face you want.
I just think you'll sell more cookbooks if you don't look like you just made love to an ice cube.
Andrew, dear, I'm going to take a little break.
would you please tell this gentleman that if he calls me "sweetie" one more time,
I'm gonna grab his camera and take a picture of his colon?
you got that, right?
Katherine, hi. What are you doing here?
the waiters need to be paid, and you took the key to the cashbox... again.
sorry. Paid for what?
the armenian wedding? Lunch for 300?
it was right after the breakfast for the garden club, which you also missed.
look, I'm sorry. I didn't know a photo shoot would take this long.
I mean, who knew it'd be this hard to pose for a book cover?
Oh, you'll be fine.
if there's one thing you're really good at, it's posing as a chef.
okay, katherine.
I know this book has been monopolizing my time, and you feel overworked and undervalued.
but I do appreciate you. In fact, I have a gift for you.
it's the galleys of my new book. Read page 2.
for katherine Mayfair-- "A wonderful cook and an even better friend."
you dedicated it to me?
well, you make this all possible. it's the least I could do.
excuse me. Time is money. Chop-chop, sweetie.
Andrew... do we have a backup pie?
Yes. Yes, we do.
good.
and the big blind...
catches a jack on the river.
Preston? - Mom!
what the hell's going on here?
don't freak out. We're just playing cards.
Oh, yeah? Why didn't you play at home? Why did you have to sneak in here?
tequila shots! 5 bucks!
asked and answered.
okay, that's it! Everybody out. Game's over.
can I have your chair for a second? Look up here!
mom's here. Party's over. Door's open. Out you go. Go on. Shoo!
you guys have pulled a lot of stupid stunts. But this? This?
risking our liquor license, our livelihood?
who's going to find out?
I mean, we've been running this game for a month, and nobody...
unbelievable. You guys are grounded for two weeks.
but we have mecoming. - Yeah, yeah!
keep complaining. I'd love to make it a year. Now clean this place up. Now!
that was fantastic.
amazing.
you were incredible.
so were you.
and...
time to go.
so it's been, what, four months?
are you ever gonna let me spend the night?
I don't know. Come on, zippy, zippy.
okay. It's just, you know...
girls usually beg me to spend the night.
well, good, then you shouldn't have any problem finding a place to sleep.
fine. I know the drill.
I can't spend the night. I can't meet your friends. I can't meet your soN.
I'm just wondering-- is this ever gonna turn into something normal?
you know, you're a guy, and we just had hot sex, and I didn't force you to cuddle.
so run! Go! Brag to your friends.
look... I like you, and I know you like me.
so why can't we be a couple?
cause I'M... not ready for that.
and what we've got-- that's all I can handle.
go.
okay, but that's only gonna work, like, 500 or 600 more times.
good evening.
can I help you?
wrong question.
the question is, can I help you?
look, if you're trying to sell me something, I don't have any money.
you do now.
I don't understand.
I'm here to buy you out of your lease.
what? - I know. It's sudden.
but there's something about this house that...
well, it just feels like home to me.
so I'd like to move in... tonight.
tonight? Areou crazy?
a little bit. Okay, here.
I will more than cover your moving expenses.
look, uh... I-I'm all set up here.
besides, my landlady would never allow it.
why don't you let me worry about her?
mm, no. I-I don't have anywhere else to go.
I think you should leave.
look, raymond...
how do you know my name?
I made you a very generous offer, and I just know you're going to make the right decision. Five.
five what? What are you talking about?
four. - Are you-- I don't understand.
three. - O-okay. Hang on for a second.
two.
well, raymond, thank you very much.
here you go. Take care.
all taken care of... mrs. Williams.
thank you... mr. Williams.
the next morning, edie britt decided to announce her return to wisteria lane in a way...
that was guaranteed...
to make a big splash.
okay, you're not gonna believe this, but...
she's back.
Edie? Is that really you?
you know someone else my age with a body like this?
so you're back?
what happened to your tenant?
he, uh, came into some money and decided to move.
we thought, what the heck? Let's move back!
we?
Oh, you don't know. I have a husband now.
Really? Whose?
so I'm in vegas talking to this real estate convention.
I do a little motivational speaking.
and there-- sixth row, center aisle, is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.
so after I finish, I walk into the audience and I ask this goddess out.
his seminar was called "getting what you want," and he did...
three times. Before dinner.
well, it's certainly nice to meet you, dave, and let us be the first to welcome you to wisteria lane.
Oh, you know what? We should have a dinner or something.
Oh, let's make it a party.
we could do it at my restaurant.
we'd be honored. - Thank you.
so, gaby, I have to ask.
what the hell happened to you?
I mean, look at you. Your--your clothes, your--your hair.
Carlos might be blind, but the rest of us aren'T.
I had two children.
for what? Breakfast? - Edie?
on your first day back in the neighborhood?
you're right.
I'm sorry, gaby.
it was rude and insensitive, and it won't happen again.
Really?
okay.
now shouldn't we offer your friends something to eat?
I baked some muffins.
please don't take this the wrong way, but...
we love you.
mijita! Lunch is ready. Go get your sister.
Carlos, what's with all the cheese?
you know how juanita feels about brussels sprouts.
I'm just trying to make vegetables more fun.
well, next time, give her a carrot and put her on a roller coaster.
have you tried to lift her lately?
I know she's gotten chubby. She'll grow out of it.
we can only hope with your D. N.A. Running through her veins.
Hey, I do not have fat D. N.A.
Oh, don't make me pull out the solis family photo album.
it's like a bunch of sea lions posing on a rock.
well, I'm sorry my relatives don't measure up to thgroup of stick-thin drunks that you come from.
all I'm sang is that our daughter has a weight problem, and the sooner we admit it, the better.
she's only 4.
but, you know, you want her to develop a weight problem? Go ahead.
nag, criticize, make her feel self-conscious.
see what happens.
and obviously I am not getting through to the twins, because no matter what I say, they keep pulling this crap, and I am sick of it.
honey, could you...
sorry. - Yeah.
so you-- you want me to talk to them?
you have to. I am tired of being the bad cop.
you walk the beat for a while.
fine. You know, boys this age, they're more likely to listen to their dads anyway.
I-I can handle this.
I really appreciate it.
honey, you know what I'd appreciate? Could you...
sorry.
so kirby has aces in the hole... - yeah.
Whicmeans that bobby will have to wear a dress to school on monday.
Oh, my! Okay. you've got to get a picture of that!
Tom? Can I talk to you a sec?
Yeah.
don't you think you were kind of sending the wrong message in there?
I know we don't approve of what they did, but you--you gotta admit. Come on.
starting their own casino is kind of creative.
yeah? "Creative" like selling fake I. D.S was creative.
and hot-wiring mccluskey's car-- that was a work of art.
honey, honey, this is nothing like that.
I mean, look, the whole school is talking about their card game.
do you realize it was, like, the place to be on a monday night?
Oh, my god. - What?
you think they're cool. - Well... yeah.
no, I mean you think they're cool in that you wanna be them.
Oh, please. - You do!
this is tom, former high school nerd, living vicarusly through his awesome-ass kids.
Hey, I was plenty cool in high school.
are we redefining "cool" to include playing trombone in the marching band?
you're overreacting.
you're a little high-spirited, but I trust them.
so I've decided to unground them for the homecoming dance.
but I told them they couldn't go.
and you told me to handle it, and I just did.
Oh, by the way, it wasn't a trombone. It was a tuba.
know your brass.
you said I could have cake.
I know, but so much? You could've gone back for a second piece.
this is my second piece.
and it's not juanita's fault.
in this kind of situation, I blame the parents.
look, my kid would eat sugar all day long if I let her.
Gaby's obviously one of those moms who just can't say no.
it's a shame, too.
Juanita has such a pretty face.
I'm back. You want something cold?
well, actually, I'm in the mood for something hot.
you know...
this is why it's taking four months to get my house painted.
haven't you ever heard that expression, "you can have it done fast, or you can have it done right"?
I think I'll have it done right now.
uh, lynette, it's not really a good time.
I just need five seconds to bitch about tom, and then I'll
Oh, my god. your painter isn't done yet?
Yeah. He--he's hard to keep track of.
well, anyway, tom refuses to acknowledge that the twins are turning into juvenile delinquents.
just the other day, I was-- - oh, you poor thing! You need a hug.
have you been drinking?
sorry to have barged in, and thanks for letting me get that off my chest.
Hey, anytime that you need to talk, you just ring my bell... and wait.
okay, new rule. From now on, sex only happens in the bedroom, door closed, between the hours of 7: 00 and 10: 00 P. M.
you know what?
it'd be a hell of a lot easier for me to follow the rules if I knew why they existed.
I just don't want my friends to know.
Why? You--you ashamed of me?
no, of course not.
it's just... complicated.
I'm just a simple guy, so i can't be your dirty little secret.
I need more from you.
I'm sorry. I can't give that to you.
honey, I know you wanna go home and watch your cartoons, but you had a lot of cake, so I was thinking I'd take you to the park.
that way, you could run around and get some nice, fun exercise.
no. - You sure?
running around in the sun and fresh air would make you feel good.
no.
okay. Why don't you go throw that in the trash?
and I'm gonna get the car started.
he juanita. You wanna play a new game on the way home?
winner gets a new doll. - Okay.
well, come on, then!
mommy, what are you doing?
it's a new game I invented, and you're winning 1 to nothing!
Katherine! Fantastic news.
what's cookin' fairview?
is sending out a camera crew tomorrow to do a piece on me and the book.
Oh, which I just finished this morning.
you read it ready? - Yes. I couldn't put it down.
but I have to tell you, at least a dozen recipes are missing a pretty crucial ingredient.
Really? What?
my name.
excuse me?
Bree, your book is filled with recipes that we developed together, and--and some of them are flat-out mine.
Oh, don't be silly. I may have based a few on your recipes, but I always changed someing.
like what? The font?
name one difference between this meatloaf recipe and mine.
well, yours calls for minced curly leaf parsley.
mine calls for minced flat leaf.
it's minced! Who can tell the difference?
Bree, you have recipes in here you can't even make.
never heard anything so absurd.
the croquembouche cake with the spun sugar netting?
I've never once seen you work with molten sugar. I always make that cake.
really, katherine. Just because I let you execute a few eye-catching garnishes that gratify your need to show off, doesn't mean that I can't do them just as well myself.
you let me?
I thought we were partners.
we are.
that's why your name is on the dedication page.
you were right about the dedication, bree.
it really was the leastyou could do.
18 to zero!
2 more points, and you'll break the record.
mommy, I'm tired!
Really?
well, I thought running through that guy's sprinkler would've refreshed you.
now come on! - No.
looks like mommy's gonna score her first 2 points.
come on, Juanita. Show mommy what a winner you are.
Juanita! What are you doing?
Juanita, stop!
and while I thought grounding you was an appropriate punishment, your dad convinced me I was being a little too hard on you guys.
Absolutely.
and so we have decided to let you go to the homecoming dance tonight...
that's right!
in your father's convertible.
um, um, h-h-hold on. What?
come on, tom. I mean, we trust them, right?
Yes, yes. I-I would trust them more if they were driving your car.
No! You don't want two cool kids pulling up to homecoming in a mom car, especially with that big dent they put in it last month. Here you go.
dude! - Thanks!
don't thank me. Thank your father.
Thanks, dad! you rock!
here--some ground rules. N-no muddy shoes on my floor mats.
Tom, relax!
you high-spirited kids do whatever it takes to have fun.
I'm driving it, man.
and in three, two, one.
welcome back to "what's cookin' fairview?
we're talking with Bree Van De Kamp, fairview's premier caterer, who's about to publish her very first cookbook.
Bree, could you show us inside?
this is my kitchen, and this is my staff
the most gifted, hardworking team a cook could ever have hoped for.
I cannot say enough good things about them.
so which one of you has worked with bree the longest?
that would be me.
so tell me, what's it really like working with bree?
it's inspiring.
there is absolutely nothing she can't do.
Katherine, I'm blushing.
working with her has been...
such an education that I
Oh, god. Are you all right?
I think I strained my wrist. God, it hurts.
Oh, you poor dear. Could someone please get some ice?
Oh, no.
Oh, and I was just about to put the spun sugar netting on our famous croquembouche.
would you mind doing it?
Katherine, I'm sure your wrist is just fine.
no, it's really throbbing.
okay, it looks like bree to the rescue.
be sure you get this. Really something to see.
the secret to spinning sugar is this special whisk that makes lovely gossamer threads.
careful, dear. You're clumping.
I can see that.
that stuff's hot! - Sorry.
so that's your idea of exercise? Having her run after a car?
Carlos, our daughter sucked down half a sheet cake, and afterwards, no one could find the candles.
wake up! We have got a problem!
I just don't think the solution is to humiliate her.
now even if she's ... heavy, doesn't she have the right to feel good about herself?
Hey, I'm protecting her.
she doesn't know the truth yet.
women only have five seconds to be young d beautiful, and then it's gone.
and then before you know it, we're old and fat and married and wondering where our beauty went.
no, Carlos. I mean...
sometimes I'm glad you can't see me.
five years and two kids and no time for facials or the gym. It just...
takes a toll.
and when Edie same the other day, it was like she didn't even recognize me.
listen to me.
nobody knows your face better than I do.
and I see it every time I kiss you.
in 5 years or 50, you will always be beautiful.
hear me?
and now to finish, you simply transfer your spun sugar to the croquembouche and gracefully drape it around in a delicate swirl.
did I meion that you...
probably shouldn't be wearing jewelry while working with spun sugar?
well, there's no law that says it has to be a delicate veil.
I mean, it could really just be a beautiful, um, little, uh, white...
ribbon.
turn off the damn camera.
Ah, actually, my wrist is feeling a little better.
why don't I give it a shot?
whatcha doing?
okay, where are they?
it's 30 minutes past curfew.
actually, it's 32.
if there is a single scratch on that car
I mean, after all the time that I spent restoring that thing...
Yeah.
remember when you spent the entire day on the internet trying to find a new gearshift knob?
worst anniversary ever.
I cannot believe that you did this to me.
I know. That car is your baby.
if only there was something i felt that intensely about.
Oh, wait! There is-- my actual babies.
you think I don't care about our boys?
I know you love them, but sometimes you find them so cool and entertaining, you forget to parent them.
Lynette-- - no, listen.
this is important.
when they were little and they'd act out, and we'd always say, "relax! They're young. When they're older, they'll get it.
well, Tom, they're 16 now.
not getting it.
we have a lot of work to do in a very short time, and if you and i aren't in sync, I'm afraid it's not gonna happen.
Hey, sorry we're late.
Yeah. But, dad, you have to hear this story.
we just pulled up at an intersection, and there were these two hot girls
I don't want to hear it.
you ever hear of a thing called a cell phone?
we're only, like, 35 minutes late.
Yeah, 35 minutes, during which time your mother and i have been worried ck.
but, dad
you broke the rules. There are consequences.
you're both grounded for a month.
this sucks!
you're only doing this 'cause you were worried about your precious car.
you think? Get out of the way.
any other opinions you'd like to share?
thank you. But you didn't have to...
that mirror was scratched.
I already ordered a new one.
Mrs. Mccluskey! You're still alive!
Oh, it's nice to see you, too, Edie.
this is my husband, Dave Williams.
so how did you two meet? You run a free clinic or something?
I'm sorry. Who are you?
Karen Mccluskey, Edie's best friend on the street.
well, it's a real pleasure to meet you.
what are you doing here?
um, I just need to talk to you.
not here. Go home. I'll call you.
when? - I don't know. Later. Just go.
I have to say, ladies, this is quite a shindig.
Oh, I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.
Yeah, I mean, there's really not a lot of people who go to this much trouble to say they're sorry.
excuse me? - Well, the party.
it's just a beautiful way to apologize.
Edie, this is not a "we're sorry" party.
this is a "we forgive you" party.
you forgive me?
well, I think what gaby means is you were fairly awful to us right before you left, and this is our way of welcoming you back to hopefully not do it again.
you gotta be kidding.
you froze me out.
you threatened to ruin my business, and you ran me out of town.
now it's taken me five years to stop hating you.
great party, ladies. thank you very much.
now... mind if I steal my wife? Sweetheart?
Hey, little girl， isn't that your painter?
I wanna be your boyfriend.- Is it? I can't tell. - Sweet little girl ,I wanna be your boyfriend do you love me, babe?
excuse me. - It's okay.
what do you say?
do you love me, babe?
what can I say?
didn't they pay the bill?
all right. Calm down. I'll take care of it.
you, come with me.
why would you humiliate me in front of my friends? Are you a lunatic?
I-I'm just trying to get through to you.
and, yeah, it's making me kinda crazy.
Susan... why can't I meet your friends?
I mean, am i really that horrible?
no, of course not. My friends would love you.
then what is the problem?
the problem is, if you meet my friends, then we're in a relationship, and I can't be in a relationship right now.
but I-I promise, I'll make you very happy.
well, maybe I don't deserve to be happy.
a few years ago...
there was this car accident...
a bad one.
take the high road? Did you hear what those smug bitches said to me?
Edie, it's important these people like us. It's our home now.
I never should've let you talk me into moving back here.
Why? Why were you so gung ho on wisteria lane?
listen to your husband.
we can be happy here, but we need these people to like us.
Why?
it'll just make everything easier.
that was an accident.
Susan, you can't feel guilty about it.
you know what, jackson?
you're not gonna say anything I haven't already heard a million times.
I-I only told you because I...
I just want you to understand why I can't let you in my life.
well...
do you mind if I hang out for the next few months and see if you change your mind?
Yeah, I guess I could handle that.
well, why don't you... go have fun with your friends?
and just call me when you're free. - Okay.
please, danielle. You have no right to take him.
I have every right. He's my kid.
Danielle, we agreed I would raise him.
we agreed it would be best!
you said it would be best!
I've had no say in anything!
but I am married now, and leo's a lawyer.
so do yourself a favor and don't try to fight this!
please, danielle, we can have any arrangement you like.
please, just don't take him!
for god sakes, orson's gone. You kids are grown. Benjamin's all I have!
you're just gonna have tfind something else.
honey, come to bed. It's after 2: 00.
the cooking show agreed to redo my segment.
I wanna make sure it's perfect this time.
well, I won't tell you how to run your business.
it's your baby.
Yes, it is.
um, M. J. Ready?
Yeah, he's upstairs waiting for you.
I told you the brakes were squeaking.
I asked you to get them checked.
and I checked 'em!
I meant a mechanic... not you.
it was not the brakes, susan.
if it had been, it wouldn't have mattered. They crashed into us!
and we killed them, mike!
we didn't kill them! They died.
they were a mother and a child.
she was a mother, just like me...
with a child just like ours.
and if it weren't for us, they would still be alive.
Yeah, we have been over and over this, susan.
it's--it's like you want to suffer.
it's like you don't care at all, like you feel nothing for those people.
I can't do this again! I just can't!
did you pack your dinosaur book so you can read it with your daddy?
sure did.
Oh, good.
okay, you have fun, sweetie.
so, um, I'll probably bring him back sunday around 6: 00 or so.
fine.
well, have a good weekend. Doing anything special?
well, I've sort of starteseeing someone.
so I might do something with him.
good for you.
Yeah.
it goes by so quickly.
in a flash, the life we knew is gone forever.
and we're left to ask ourselves...
how could he have left me?
when did my beauty start to fade?
why has my friend changed?
was I the best mother I could have been?
of course, there are some people who understand how quickly time passes.
that's why they're so determined to get what they want before it's too late.
Oh, dr. Heller. I've been meaning to call you.
Yeah, I was getting concerned.
you're required to check in once a month.
it was a condition of your release.
Oh, come on. That was a year ago.
but to be honest, the meds are working so well, I kinda forgot about you.
no offense.
Dave, once a month.
not optional.
message received, doc.
but seriously, you don't need to worry about me.
I'm great. I'll talk to you in a month.
just tell me.
what are the magic words that I've gotta say so you will let me out of here?
Dave, you've been here six weeks, and you don't seem any closer to coming to terms with your rage.
I've come to terms with it, and I like it just the way it is.
the charges were dropped because you agreed to put yourself in a doctor's care.
I'm not going to authorize your release until I see some real progress.
Wh-what's progress supposed to look like to you, doc?
I mean, should I just plaster some fake smile on my face and pretend this，this thing that's inside me isn't eatin' me alive?
cause I can do that if you want.
I need to make sure you're not a danger to yourself or to others.
listen, I've never been a danger to myself.
and as far as the others are concerned, there's only one person who should be worried.
my name is Bree, and I am an alcoholic.
Bree put her problem behind her.
there's at least one employer who'd love to hire me.
who?
Orson asked for a job.
you.
Dave lost his temper...
damn it, Edie! I said no!
and aroused the suspicion...
this guy is up to something of his neighbor.
it was all Karen Mccluskey's fault.
she kept asking me all this stuff about your background.
she reminds me of my grandmother when we first started to notice.
the dementia, that is.
you think Karen's going senile?
it could have been such a lovely evening.
you see, the idea was to have a surprise birthday party.
people would bring food and gifts and wait in the dark for the guest of honor to arrive.
but it turned out to be a night full of surprises
the kind most people don't care for.
damn it, Lynette. Why do you have to be such a buzz kill?
why can't you, just once, give me a little support?
fine. I'll get you a towel.
for what?
if I was with another woman, that wouldn't bother you?
no, it wouldn't.
I'm sorry that I lied, and for what it's worth, the guilt has been tearing me apart.
get your hands off me, you selfish son of a bitch!
Orson, please. You're putting me in an impossible position.
then let me make it simpler for you.
I want a divorce.
Oh, yes, it could have been such a lovely evening, but this was one party that was over...before it even began.
surprise!
you think you can screw with me?
moments before she was to leave for the party, Gabrielle Solis was at her mirror, halfheartedly putting the final touches on her lips.
you see, a problem had come to her attention...
damn.
one she couldn't gloss over.
mommy, what are you doing?
uh, well, mommy has a friend who visits her every month, and she's late, and that's bad.
Why?
because she's the one who assures me that you won't get a baby brother or sister.
but I want a little brother. - I don't care.
Oh, sorry. It's just...mommy really misses her friend, and mommy's gonna be really sad if her friend doesn't show up soon.
now go downstairs and play. Mommy has some praying to do.
well, I have your test results.
Congratulations. You're pregnant.
Mrs. Solis.
I don't care. You told me this couldn't happen. You said it was impossible!
the human reproductive system is complicated and often unpredictable.
sometimes miracles happen.
this isn't a miracle. This is a disaster.
my husband's blind. Neither one of us have jobs.
my husband's blind.
trust me. Children are a blessing.
you'll see. It'll all work out.
well, I hope to God you're right.
and what does this number mean anyway?
that's your beta number, and it's high, which indicates the possibility of twins.
Gaby, relax.
this baby is gonna be the best thing that ever happened to us.
I am so sick of everybody looking at the glass half-full.
the glass is empty, people, and so is our bank account.
is that what you're worried about--money?
look, I'll get a job.
what are you gonna do, take up piano and get a contract with motown?
actually, I was thinking about becoming a masseur.
you don't need your eyes for that. It's all about the touch.
well, I guess that's not the worst idea you've ever had.
but it's not just about the money, Carlos. It's...
Oh, after my miscarriage, I gave up on this dream.
I just figured God decided I couldn't possibly be a good mom, so he didn't make it happen.
well, he obviously changed his mind.
well, I wish he'd stop doing that.
nobody likes a fickle God.
babe, believe me.
you getting pregnant is--is-- is a one-in-a-million shot. It's a miracle.
now let's embrace it and celebrate.
Hello, Mrs. Solis.
I have your test results.
great. So do I have anemia? Is that why I've been so tired?
no. Not exactly.
and please don't slap me.
I'm pregnant!
Oh, my God. It's another miracle.
Yeah, we're up to two miracles, and if you come back from the dead after I kill you, it'll be three.
w-why you mad at me?
Oh, Gaby, why do I need to wear a condom?
there's no way lightning's gonna strike twice.
well, I didn't think it would.
put the baby down, Carlos.
I don't want to.
do it. I need to hit something, and it needs to be you.
you are looking at this all wrong.
this is one-in-a-million. We should--we should celebrate and embrace
Oh, cram it, you fertile freak.
you're getting a vasectomy.
I can't do that. We're catholic. It's against our religion.
I got news for you. We just converted to Judaism.
problem solved. Mazel tov!
Gaby, it's not just that. There are other reasons
I am done fighting off your bionic sperm.
you're getting snipped, and that's final.
you're awfully quiet tonight.
got a lot on my mind. I think I'm pregnant.
what? - I know. It's crazy.
you had a vasectomy. It's impossible.
Yeah. So what makes you think you're pregnant?
my period's late, and that never happens to me. I'm like a Swiss clock.
Oh, come on. There could be a lot of reasons for that.
so let's not worry about it right now.
we're going to a party. You gotta lighten up.
okay. But I'm gonna talk to Bob.
Bob? Why?
because he and Lee are here. Bob's an attorney.
I'm gonna get him to sue the qck who obviously botched your vasectomy.
Oh, Gaby, let's not go there.
hiring an attorney's expensive, and I don't know that we can prove anything.
well, I'm gonna find out.
fine. But... let's not talk to Bob.
I don't want our neighbors involved in our business.
Oh, don't worry. He's a professional. He'll keep it confidential.
Gaby, no. You can't talk to him.
why the hell not?
I never got a vasectomy.
Hi, guys. Welcome to the party.
earlier that evening, as she waited for her guests to arrive, Susan Mayer took a moment to do her eyebrows.
of course, she had no way of knowing just how those eyebrows...
sorry I'm late.
would soon be raised.
what took you so long? People are gonna be here any minute.
I need you to pour the cheap vodka into the expensive bottles.
I couldn't find my pants.
I'm here so much that when I go back to my place, I can't remember where anything is.
well, just please change your shirt.
you know, I've been thinking that I spend so much time with you now anyway that
fine. You can have a little space in the closet.
I think I've got some clothes from the '80s I'm ready to part with.
actually, I'm talking about moving in.
moving in? Here?
Yeah. That's where we're headed. We should take the plunge. What do you think?
so obviously, this is the bedroom.
right.
so do you want to stick with this color or switch it up or what?
I don't know.
I'm sort of going through a difficult transition in my life right now.
I need a change.
uh, I was thinking... taupe.
sounds good.
you know, I like this place. It's got a good vibe.
uh, thanks.
and a nice scent. What is that, your perfume?
get out.
excuse me?
I was not born yesterday, pal.
you're coming on to me.
no, I'm not.
Oh, please. Telling me I smell good?
I'm not even wearing deodorant.
I said the house smells good.
semantics. And then the not so subtle sit-on-the-bed maneuver?
you know, why not just ask for a massage?
I sat because my feet hurt from you dragging me around for an hour, telling me you want to paint every room taupe.
you said you liked it.
look, you're obviously going through a rough patch.
I was afraid if I suggested anything outside the beige family, I might send you over the edge.
I'll let myself out.
no. No, don't go.
that was very sweet of you to consider my feelings.
you know what? You're hired.
uh, thanks... I think.
so do you need to look these over one more time?
okay, then just sign them, and you'll be officially divorced.
you know what? We need a minute.
take your time.
are we doing the right thing here?
you're kidding me, right?
once we sign these papers, there's no going back.
I can't believe this.
you were the one who called the lawyer.
I know.
I'm thinking...that maybe that was a mistake.
we've been separated for a year.
all we're doing today is making it official.
we wouldn't be here if it weren't for that accident. You know that.
before that, we were good.
we could get back there.
it's nobody's fault, but I can't do this anymore.
Oh, come on!
we were Mike and Susan, remember?
you only get one of those in a lifetime.
we could make things right again.
Yeah.
and here's how.
you're back.
so what do you think?
it--it looks good.
Yeah, I-I-I think you were right to stick with this color. It looks fantastic.
Thanks.
do you like scotch?
okay...
I need to be honest about something.
H-honest? Okay.
I don't usually do this kind of thing, hook up like this, out of the blue.
not that it wasn't great, 'cause it was, but I'm not really looking to start anything.
work is crazy, and I just got a dog, and...I'm just not in that place right now.
so just to be clear, you're saying you don't want a relationship?
sorry.
I probably should have said that right up front.
no, uh... it's fantastic.
Really?
I don't want a relationship either.
all I want from you is exactly what we just did.
except next time, it's Susan.
Yeah.
Mrs. Mayer was probably a little formal for the moment.
so there's gonna be a next time?
unless you're not interested.
are you kidding?
I'm this close to doing a victory lap around the bed.
so you're really fine with this, just a purely physical thing?
I'm ready for something a little more casual.
I've heard of women like you, but...I thought you were an urban myth.
did you hear what I said?
uh, yeah. You want to move in.
I-it's just that when I'm not with you, I'm waiting to be with you.
I've never felt like this before. So...
what do you think? Do you want to live together?
no.
so that's it? Just no? You're not gonna give me a reason?
what's wrong with the way things are? Why change everything now?
because... I've fallen in love with you.
Hi, guys. Welcome to the party.
the last thing Lynette Scavo did before a party was to check for gray hairs.
penny! Let's go! Time for bath!
you're 9.
Hey, what's the matter, sweetie?
is daddy dying?
what? Of course not.
why would you say something like that?
I heard Porter and Preston fighting about who's gonna get daddy's car when he dies.
they're just being silly. They're always silly.
that's why we won't be sad when they move out of the house. Come on.
but everybody dies someday, right?
Yes, but daddy's gonna live to a ripe old age unless he doesn't get home in time for Mrs. Mccluskey's party, and then all bets are off.
Oh, daddy's gonna be fine. Come on.
my husband-- I'm Lynette Scavo.
Dr. Baron called me-- - I'm Dr. Baron.
what happened?
your husband was working on an electrical panel at his restaurant...and received a massive shock.
essentially, his heart stopped pumping.
is he...
fortunately, there was a policeman eating in the restaurant.
he administered C.P.R. until the ambulance got there.
so he's okay?
his heart restarted.
now it's a matter of determining if there's any tissue damage.
we're optimistic, but the next 36 hours are critical.
father O'brien, please report to the...
so I'm thinking no more electrical work, okay?
the kids know everything's fine.
they send their love.
don't worry about anything, okay? Just rest.
I'll come back soon, okay?
you know what I thought?
when I was lying there on the floor, I thought, I'm gonna die in a pizza place.
I mean, my whole life was gonna be summed up with this obituary headline local pizza shop owner dies.
but it doesn't matter because you're not dying.
I need more, Lynette. I need-- th-there's gotta be more.
okay. Okay. We'll find more.
just rest now, okay?
Hey, sexy.
drop the rake and get in.
what the hell is this?
this is the car that I have wanted my whole life.
when I was 12 years old, I had a poster of this baby up on my wall.
and when I was 12, I had a poster of Shaun Cassidy, but you don't see me driving around in him, do you?
I want to show you something.
what, do machine guns come out of the headlights?
I carry this around to remind me of the day that I almost died.
that day you promised me that we would find more.
I'm keeping the car.
so do you want a ride?
where have you been?
so help me, if Mccluskey gets there before us, I will brain you.
sorry. Let's go. - Well, sheesh.
sweetie, we already got Karen a candle.
an R.V. Might be overkill.
Yeah, but that's not for her. That's for us.
I'm about to blow your mind, Lynette.
Oh, don't. I like my mind the way it is.
what would you say to the idea of taking the kids out of school for a year and bopping around the country in one of these sweet rides?
well, I might not say anything.
I might justut my finger to my ear and twirl it in small circles.
we can't do something like that, Tom. - Yes, we can.
we can do whatever we want. Life is short.
okay, let me ask you one tiny question about this big adventure plan of yours who's gonna be running our restaurant while we're off doing the electric kool-aid acid test?
that won't be our problem.
the last few weeks, I've been talking to a guy from Passentino's pizza.
they want to buy us out.
this afternoon, I said yes.
Hey, guys. You ready to party?
moments before she was due at her friend's party, Bree Hodge was at the mirror, applying her eyeliner.
aren't you dapper?
when I tell everyone I'm your new partner, I want to look the part.
it would not be the last time that evening Bree would find herself...
um, actually, dear...
drawing a line.
I'd rather you not talk about the job tonight.
but, Bree, this is the first party in months when I can answer the question, "what's new?"
without mumbling into my drink.
well, it's just vulgar to discuss business at a party.
you haven't told Katherine yet, have you?
it's not that easy. You know she'll be furious.
Yes, but the great thing about Katherine is she'll express it so passive-aggressively, we'll hardly notice.
look, I know she's your friend, but she's also our employee.
why is this so difficult for you?
it's... complicated.
careful, dear. You don't want to be ill tomorrow.
Yes. Nothing like a headache to spoil a perfectly nice first day in prison.
uh, would anybody like some more frittata?
is my wife amazing or what?
I mean, how many inmates get sent off with a festive champag brunch?
uh, w-when you're in jail, you might want to avoid words like "festive" and "brunch."
they kind of say, "hi. I'm husband hunting.
Andrew, please.
it's fine.
this is my last taste of freedom for three years.
I want jokes. I want fun, laughter.
anyway, prison won't be such a big change.
you're a dentist. You're used to cavity searches.
you vowed to me that you wouldn't say that.
Bree tells me that you're going to make very good use of your time away.
uh, yes. He's going to read a lot of classic books, maybe study a language.
Yes, uh, he can learn the Italian for, "I cost five cigarettes."
Andrew, really.
Bree, he's joking. Everything's fine...
except my glass, which seems to be empty.
Oh, for God sake. Get up.
we have the garden club lunch in...
you've been drinking?
go away. I don't feel well.
we have a lunch to cater.
I'm too tired. Can you do it?
get up.
when did this start?
when Orson left, I...began having a glass of white wine now and then.
then when Danielle took Benjamin, I didn't see any reason to stop at just one.
so is this why you missed the lunch last week and the braverman bar mitzvah?
I can't help myself, all right?
my husband's gone. My son's gone. I have nothing left.
no, actually, you have a lunch for 40 in 3 hours, and I'm not letting you out of it.
Oh, Katherine, please.
okay, so you have a void in your life. Welcome to the club.
don't fill it with wine.
fill it with work, with accomplishments.
just think about the woman you could be by the time Orson gets back.
or is this the woman you want him to come home to?
he's gonna be so ashamed of me.
no, he won't...
because you're not gonna tell him.
you know he'd just blame himself.
I don't know if I can make it this time.
Yes, you will, because I am moving in.
you would do that?
when I had nothing, you made me your partner.
I'm not gonna forget that.
I am gonna get you through this.
and when we're done, that scary woman over there she's never gonna be seen in this house again.
when you think about it, tonight is the ideal time for you to tell Katherine.
the presence of the other guests will keep her from causing a scene, and as word spreads that we're partners
and how is word going to spread? - I'll be spreading it.
people will be congratulating me, and Katherine will have to join in and risk looking petty.
and she'll be twice as mad at having been put in that position.
I am not telling her tonight. - Fine. Then I will.
no, you will not. I forbid it.
you know, for a partner, you're sounding a lot like a boss.
I am telling her.
look, if we can't agree on something this basic, maybe we shouldn't work together.
what are you saying?
I'm saying, maybe you should reconsider joining the company.
I have no intention of reconsidering.
fine. You're fired.
Hey, guys. You ready to party?
the party was in full swing, and everyone was waiting to surprise the guest of honor.
little did they know, an even bigger surprise was on its way.
sorry I'm late. There was a line at the bakery.
well, you really went all out. - Yeah, she deserves it.
can I help you, Mrs. Mccluskey?
this letter for Edie came to my house by mistake.
I'm making sure that none of my stuff, uh, came here.
well, it's all yours.
anything interesting?
fortunately, no.
I just saw your friend Karen outside.
is she still asking you questions about me?
a few, but don't take it personally.
prying is what people too old to have sex do to keep life interesting.
she's turning 70 next week. - No kidding.
Hey, we should throw her a party.
I'm already taking her out for a drink. That's plenty.
she'll be 70, sweetheart.
don't you think that calls for something bigger?
look, Karen's a friend, but I don't like having her in my house.
it would be one thing if we had a bathroom with a window you could open, but...
well, couldn't you ask someone else to host it?
well, I suppose I could palm it off to Mayer. - Good.
tell her we'll supply the food and liquor.
you know, Karen's not a fan of yours.
why do you want to throw her a party?
it's a big day for her.
I just want to make sure it's special.
so...
what do you think?
I think that is one hell of an outfit to wear to a 70th birthday party.
it's my gift to Karen.
I figure she'll get at least five good boob jokes out of it.
well, she'll be here soon, so let's go over this one more time.
okay.
I take her home, then I come up with some excuse to get her over to Susan's, where everyone jumps out and yells, "surprise"!
which I still say isn't the smart thing to do to a 70-year-old.
Mrs. Mccluskey. Happy birthday.
jeez, Edie, are we going for drinks or mammograms?
that's one.
Oh, let me grab my earrings, and we're good to go.
so...
it's quite a milestone. How's it feel?
Edie told me that she takes you out for a birthday drink every year.
I think that's a great tradition.
look, I'm just trying to be friends here.
all right then.
I'll see you later. Come on. Let's go.
I've got enough friends.
Where's Karen?
she'll be here as soon as she gives her cat some medicine.
do you think she'll be surprised?
Oh, absolutely.
what the...
just so I'm clear, you want us to sell our thriving business so we can live in a bus, like carnies?
come on. This is cool. We can go wherever we want.
the--the kids could see America.
and when we start stealing to support ourselves, the kids can see the inside of a prison.
you're right, Tom. It's a brilliant idea.
damn it, Lynette. Why do you have to be such a buzz kill?
why can't you, just once, give me a little support?
fine. I'll get you a towel.
for what?
Bree, you can't fire me, not after all the sacrifices I made for you.
Orson, stop throwing jail in my face.
you cellmate was a crooked C.P.A. who helped you form a bridge club.
it wasn't exactly Attica.
Bree, I need this job.
do you have any idea what it's like to wake up every morning and have no reason to get out of bed?
to smile and nod at neighbors who know your wife's supporting you because no one will hire a felon?
I am drowning, and for you to throw me a lifeline and then snatch it away
Orson, I should have never offered you that job. It wasn't fair to Katherine.
I am your husband.
why are you putting Katherine's feelings ahead of mine?
Orson, please. You're putting me in an impossible position.
then let me make it simpler for you.
I want a divorce.
Katherine, great dress.
you're gonna turn some heads with that one.
I hope you're enjoying this party, Carlos, because you're not gonna live to see another one.
look, I'm sorry that I lied, and for what it's worth, the guilt has been tearing me apart.
you know what's gonna tear me apart?
another 10-pound baby shooting out my hoo-ha.
honey, look at it this way, God blessed us again because you are such a great mom.
get your hands off me, you selfish son of a bitch.
I told you I love you.
doesn't that mean anything to you?
Yes. It means that someone forgot that we had an agreement to keep things casual.
okay.
so if we're not in a relationship, if I was with another woman, that wouldn't bother you?
no, it wouldn't.
quiet, everyone. She's coming. Move it.
surprise!
you think you can screw with me?
what do you mean?
Karen, what the hell are you doing?
ask that husband of yours!
No! - Let's not be doing that.
no, that man broke into my house tonight!
what?
Yes, and he-- and he moved things around, and he--and heook a picture off the wall, and then he put the table next to the couch, and the dish for the keys
it's always by the...It's always by the door.
and that's not the first time he's broken in either.
he stole my cat, and then he put him back.
okay, Mrs. Mccluskey, why would I do those things?
Karen, I hate to say it, but you're not making a lot of sense right now.
maybe you need to lie down.
you...
I think we should call 9-1-1.
let go of me!
why are you all acting like I'm crazy?
Halle-damn-lujah, I got my period!
Oh, was she surprised?
she seemed totally disoriented, babbling.
I just hope it isn't dementia.
she lives by herself.
we'll alert the hospital. We're gonna need a psych evaluation.
thank you. Thank you.
poor Karen. I hope she's okay.
Yeah, me, too.
we should probably talk now, huh?
Yeah. Let's talk.
does this relationship have a future?
Jackson, what we have here has been working pretty well.
answer the question.
can't we just keep going the way we are?
and there's my answer.
it seems like they're taking good care of her.
I hope you didn't mean what you said earlier.
you just don't understandwhat I owe to Katherine.
you're right. I don't.
you started the company and gave her a job when she needed one badly.
why are you the one who owes her?
you know that...brunch we had for you right before you left for prison?
I was very tense, and I was very unhappy.
so I had...a glass of champagne.
she's tough. I'm sure she'll be okay.
how about the crazy married couple throwing drinks? How are they gonna be?
you know, I just thought that you got it, that you knew what I was going through after accident.
you know, obviously I was wrong.
no, I get it.
the sports car, the garage band...
maybe what we need now, Tom, is for you to get it.
Hey, I was the one laying on the floor with a cop pounding on my chest.
and I had cancer. I get it. I get it.
you want your life to count something. - Exactly.
I just don't want to keep making pizzas every day till I drop to the floor for real.
I want my life to be exciting. You know, I need adventure.
Scavo' s was the adventure.
we changed our whole lives so you could live out your dream, and now you're bored.
we can't keep doing this, Tom.
we can't keep throwing all the cards up in the air every time you get a little restless.
let's call it a night.
we have to work tomorrow.
are you coming?
I'll come when I'm ready.
did she really need an ambulance?
I don't know.
but you would have if I hadn't started my period.
how could you have done this?
isn't it obvious? I want another kid.
we can't handle another kid.
we're living hand to mouth as it is.
that's what you said before we had Juanita and before we had Celia, and somehow we manage.
and can you imagine our lives without them?
of course I can't. It's just...
how could you have lied to me?
I just couldn't shake the idea that maybe God had one more miracle in store for us.
maybe a son.
and we have so much love in our lives, I got greedy, and I wanted more.
but you're right. It was selfish and stupid, and I am so sorry.
I will call tomorrow and schedule a vasectomy.
or... we use birth control, and I'm talking double-bagging, at least until we both decide it's a good idea.
I think I gotta kiss you.
and until we get a box of condoms in that house, that's all you're gettin'.
Orson. What's up?
Bree told me what you did for her when I was in prison.
I just want to thank you. - It's nothing.
not to bree or me.
and you were dead right to stop her from telling me.
I'd consider it an honor to work for somebody that wise.
work for? The last I heard, it was partner.
all right, how's this? I'll become a partner...
but only after you decide I've earned it. I'm a patient man.
I don't care if it takes two years.
Oh, honey... working for Bree
you're not gonna last ten months.
mind if I say good-bye to our girl?
sure, but she's a little groggy.
you planned the whole thing.
you're trying to get rid of me.
Yes.
and I'm sorry it had to be you.
cause I know you're up to something
something awful.
you don't know what "awful" is.
you take care of yourself, Karen, and I mean that.
Yes, it was a night filled with surprises.
some had learned of their husband's plans for the future...
others had discovered the truth of their wife's past...
some were touched by their husband's secret longings...
others were hurt by their lover's quick departure.
but for one resident, the evening had gone as planned, and he now turned his thoughts to his real agenda.
it wouldn't be long now before he destroyed the man who had ruined his life, but he knew he had to move carefully.
after all, he wanted it to be a surprise.
a tragic event...led to the end of a marriage...
he's dating a friend of mine.
and the complications of moving on.
medical wonders occurred...If we remove that bone fragment, you could regain your sight.
both large and small.
my husband has agreed to the procedure you suggested.
Oh, the one to alleviate his snoring?
detectives...
and a devastating lie was told.
the night of the fire, I saw somebody come out.
his name is Porter Scavo.
one morning, it occurred to Lynette Scavo she could not rememb the last time her family had breakfast together.
so Lynette did what any mother would do in that situation...
see you later, mom.
the first person who steps foot out that door will lose a leg.
she threatened her family with violence.
that was delicious.
but I did promise Chrissy I'd walk her to school today.
Oh, you are such a gentleman.
sit your ass down.
dad, make mom let me go.
everyone at this table who thinks I have the power to make your mom do anything, raise your hand.
wish I could have helped.
look, this family has been through a lot lately,
and your dad and I feel we'll be better parents if we know what's going on in your lives.
so, Parker, how's that science project you've been working on?
can I help you?
is this the residence of Porter Scavo?
Yeah. Why?
I'm Porter Scavo.
sir, can you step outside? Can you step outside?
porter Scavo, you are under arrest. - What?
you have the right to remain silent. - Wait. What's going on?
ma'am, I'm gonna have to ask you to step back.
okay, guys. Look, if this is about Warren Schilling's bar, Porter had nothing to do with that fire.
apparently, there's a witness that says otherwise. - A witness? I
now will you please step back and let us do our job?
if you give up that right, anything you say can and will be used against you.
a witness? What are they talking about?
it's gonna be okay. We'll call a lawyer.
we'll get through this.
Lynette Scavo couldn't remember the last time her family had breakfast together...
I guess we're done talking about my science project, huh?
Yes, sweetie, we are.
and she couldn't know it would be many years before her family would have breakfast together again.
it's an awful thing to live in the dark, unable to see what others take for granted.
but sometimes for a lucky few, a flicker of light pierces that darkness
and brings with it the promise of better days to come.
do you see anything?
I see light...
and some fuzzy shapes.
that's it?
that's all he can expect to see right now, but if he's able to see that much, it won't be long till his full sight returns.
can you see me, babe?
just your silhouette.
I can tell you cut your hair short.
it kinda makes your ears stick out, but I like it.
Carlos, that's the doctor. I'm right here.
it doesn't matter. I can see something other than nothing.
Oh, this is a good day.
now remember, his eyes will be very sensitive for the next few weeks,
so low light indoors, dark glasses outside
uh, doctor, we are very grateful, so don't take this the wrong way, but...
well, your septum looks great, and you say your snoring's gone.
I think we're in good shape.
will we need to come in for a follow-up?
no. I think we're done.
you know, I always tell my patients I'm gonna miss them, but this time, I really mean it.
Oh, we feel the same way about you. You've been lovely.
please excuse me.
what are you doing? - Leaving the man a thank-you card.
for a doctor?
he helped you through a very difficult time.
the least we can do is let him know how much we appreciate...
what the hell is this?
you're living with the man? Since when?
um, Alex moved in six months ago.
why the secrecy? Did you think I'd disapprove?
the man's a doctor, for heaven sakes. You've done better than I did.
I'm just trying to understand how my son could keep a secret like this from his own mother.
mom, uh, come on.
I mean, since I came out, you haven't shown the slightest interest in my love life.
of course I have.
handing me a pamphlet on the resurgence of gonorrhea?
that's not what I'm talking about.
think about it. Have you even once asked if I was dating someone?
well...
you see? You didn't really want to know.
that's why I didn't tell you.
well, I want to know now, so that's why I'm having you and Alex over to dinner tomorrow night.
what? - Yes. If he's a part of your life, I want to get to know him.
I think I'll serve fish.
actually, I said it wrong.
um, I-I think it's kind of cool the way that you ignore my love life.
nice try. Tell Alex we dress for dinner.
mom, please don't.
Andrew, you can't criticize my parenting and then deny me the chance to make up for it.
Orson and I will expect you at 8: 00.
okay.
are you sure you want me there, too? I mean, after all, I'm only a dentist.
Oh, for god sakes, Orson. Let it go.
M.J. hurry up. Your dad's here.
Hey, Katherine. What are you doing here?
well, I'm a big zoo fan, and when Mike said he was taking M.J. I asked if I could tag along.
so is that okay? - Of course. Why wouldn't it be okay?
I think it's...
great.
really, really great.
sweetie, good news.
Katherine's gonna go to the zoo with you.
why does she have to go?
well, she and your daddy are friends, and the more, the merrier.
I just want daddy.
Oh, you got me, pal.
Hey, we're all gonna have a great time, and we'll show katherine that funny swing the monkey goes on.
Oh, that sounds so cool. Will you show me that?
I guess. - Okay. Let's go.
