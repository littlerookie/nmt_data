so that we can talk without being scared?
penny, if you and Lilly don't say anything, how am I gonna know that you're okay?
leave us alone!
Gerald? Gerald! What did you do to him?
okay, okay, okay... Sergeant, I got Penny's parents on the line.
squad car's got them en route.
Jules, Jules, you're doing great. That's great news.
she made her first request. She wants to know about Gerald, okay?
so remember, just take your time, slow it down, and get her to yellow.
penny, I know that you want Lilly and Gerald to be safe.
so you know what... you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna find out for you. I'm gonna see where he is and how he's doing.
cause I think the guys I work with, they might know.
do you want me to ask?
Yeah.
okay.
guys, any word on Duglin?
guy tapped into some tunnel system in the basement.
guy knows what he's doing.
Kira, we're in a tunnel with railroad tracks.
where are we?
Brickworks-- whole subdivision used to be a brick factory.
red Brick Lane, Kiln Avenue...
what's up ahead?
which way you going?
still heading west.
westbound, tunnel ends in a warehouse.
you're gonna have to go up a level.
where is he?
where is he?
Mrs. Westler, Mr. Westler, I'm Greg Parker. We spoke on the phone.
where is she?
she's in that house, but we need to be incredibly patient here.
we haven't seen our daughter in eight years.
you can't imagine...
I understand, but Penny's exit from that house has to be on her terms, at her pace.
if she's rushed in any way, she may freeze up, she may escalate.
the only way we can get your daughter out of there safely is if we help her choose to come out.
she seems nice.
why can't we just go?
because...
they'll capture us, and what happens after that is...
what? What?
it's complicated.
have you heard of Anne Frank?
she was a little girl who lived with her family in an attic for years waiting for it to be safe to go outside because bad people were in charge, and they sent police in to drag people away to barbwire prisons.
it was just like hell, but on earth.
like devils and fire and people burning?
exactly.
so that's just like now.
so we have to be brave and wait for Gerald to come back for us.
penny, I found out about Gerald. Do you want to hear?
Yeah.
okay, well, this might sound kind of funny, but we... we don't know where he is.
no. No, you've captured him.
you had the house surrounded; we saw it on the alarm screens; you surrounded us.
I know... I know that this seems impossible, but he left.
no, he wouldn't leave.
penny, I promise you.
there's a tunnel that leads out of the basement.
you're making fun of me?
no, I'm not.
penny, I would not make fun of you.
I know that you're waiting for Gerald to come back.
I can tell that you care a lot about him.
so dear I love him that with him all deaths I could endure, without him no life.
it's from the book.
he's gone. He's gone. He's gone.
penny? - It's okay.
it's gonna be okay... It's gonna be okay.
I want to go home.
no, no, no, no.
I want to see my mommy and daddy.
no, they sent you here to be safe.
no, they... they didn't.
he made that up.
I'm going home.
no, Lilly, what are you doing?
I want to go home... now.
Sarge, Lilly wants to come out.
no, you can't walk out there.
they're going to send you to prison.
Lilly, we're not going to hurt you, I'm promise you on my life.
we're not going to hurt you.
Lilly, you can't walk out there.
Lilly, your mom and dad-- they're on a plane.
they're coming in from Sault Sainte Marie. They're so excited to see you.
I'm going home. - Lilly!
I won't let them take you away!
what's going on, guys?
penny's holding her gun on Lilly.
she thinks Lilly's going into a trap.
Jules, I don't have eyes in.
this is your call, but if Penny is threatening Lilly...
she's not going to hurt her.
Jules, stand down.
the little girl's the priority. Sam?
I have it.
she's not going to hurt her.
Lilly? Stay here.
penny, we're not going to take Lilly anywhere, unless she chooses to go.
there is no choice.
that's what the book says.
okay, I didn't read that book, Penny.
but this what I know about choice. Okay?
gerald made a choice today. He chose to leave you.
and Lilly-- Lilly's making a choice. She wants to see her mom and dad.
and you made an amazing choice.
the most amazing choice.
because you just met this little girl, and you're protecting her, and not everybody would do that.
penny, please, let her choose.
please.
she's not going to hurt her.
Lilly? Don't go outside! You'll cross the underground wire...
penny, she's going to be fine. We cut the wire.
why don't you look for yourself.
why don't you look out the window, Penny.
Sam, hold off.
I have the solution.
Lilly, it's okay. Okay, right down the stairs, okay? There you go. That's great. Good, good. All right?
right over here, okay?
you're going to be okay.
you're going to be fine.
that's a revolver, right?
six in a chamber, that's number three.
four.
five.
Where's six? Where's six? Where's six?
penny! Penny! Oh, my God.
you got it?
I got it.
Gerald, it's over.
just put the gun down and come down those steps.
hands in the air. Hands where we can see 'em.
stop! Okay? Just stop.
all right, it's up to you.
just put the gun down and come down or we will come in there.
you have five seconds.
you don't understand.
no one does.
explain it to me, Gerald.
this isn't what I wanted.
yeah? What did you want?
to be happy.
just like anybody else.
you're not like everybody else, Gerald.
put the gun down.
I can't.
without her no life.
there's six.
Jules... - It's okay.
thank you for letting Lilly choose.
he said I'd die if I left the house.
no. No! You have him.
we don't. We don't.
you have him and he isn't coming back!
we don't. We do not have him.
No! Without him no life!
okay, Penny. Penny, please. Please.
two minutes.
that's what he said.
he said two minutes. He promised.
he said he was coming back.
it's not true, is it?
he isn't coming back, is he?
Sarge, she's got her gun on Jules.
Jules, you gotta control this thing.
I have the solution.
copy that, Sam. Your call. It's your call.
no. Please.
Sarge, you gotta let me do this. She's going to be okay.
okay, Penny, I want to help you go home.
I want to help you remember the girl that you used to be.
good thinking, Jules. I'll get the mother on it. Feed her memories.
Sarah, I need you to tell us about your child.
any time that she felt joy or safe or loved or thrilled or anything.
I remember the snowstorm in the country.
we were walking, uh, trying to get to the house.
there was a snowstorm.
you and your parents.
and then we lost her. Remember we couldn't find her?
and my heart was pounding.
only for a minute they-they couldn't see you because of all the snow.
Yeah, and then we did.
we scooped up Pips, and we took her home.
and you got to stay up late.
do you remember that?
and they gave you three desserts.
Oh, mosquito netting.
she used to have it over her bed like a canopy.
a canopy that was like a tent.
and there were all these stuffed animals underneath.
the telescope she got when she turned nine-- it's still there; it's still in her room.
man, I wanted a telescope so bad when I was a kid.
Saturn.
I don't even know where that is, but I guess you do.
cause that's what your parents are saying.
they're right outside, Penny.
they're right outside. They're waiting for you.
come on, Pips. Come on.
come on, Pips.
Pip... Pip-squeak?
that's what that means, right? - Yes. That's what that means.
I know you're really scared, Penny. I know. I totally understand.
but outside-- that great big world
it's even prettier than the one in your room.
it's your choice. It's your choice. It's up to you.
yes?
Yeah. Okay. You're safe.
they're outside.
they're right outside.
on her time. Her time.
let her come to you.
Julianna Callaghan, you made me proud.
Yeah, and I wasn't even perfect.
no, you weren't.
you were human. That's what those girls needed.
that's what they both needed to get out safe.
screwing up and being human.
my biggest fear.
copy that. Look what happened.
planets aligned. It was a good day. Right?
you coming for a drink? I'm buying.
Nah. Actually, I'm going to go do something.
but I'll see you Monday?
Yeah. Yep. Right.
your e-ticket and credit card.
better hurry. It's the last flight.
dallas. Long way to go for two days.
not as long as it took me to do this.
this one's for focus, right?
Yeah. Yeah, that's for focus.
dad.
the stars-- they're still there.
we got a possible IED.
batteries, wire, pipe.
five...
confirming no visible identification.
four...
blocking remote detonators.
three...
going to try chemical detection. Burning nerve agents.
two...
this isn't good. - One.
fire in the hole.
4 hours earlier
I'm dying already.
want me to write you a note? Get you out of class?
could ya? Would ya, Officer Lane?
boss, what's the word?
they got a guy coming for the AC.
Alleluia. - Okay.
Oh, come on. - Nice.
okay, we're going to hit the briefing room and then we're going to patrol in air-conditioned comfort.
have I told you recently how much I really do love you?
Hello, boys. - Jules!
how do you manage to stay so fresh?
I think cool thoughts.
Kira, we're going to hit the streets.
team Two's going to hit Rexdale.
sergeant Rangford.
that's, uh, Mr. Rangford to you, sir.
Hey, don't call me sir. I work for a living.
how you doing, Daniel?
I'm doing fine. It's good to see you, Greg.
good to see you, too. You look good.
what are you doing out in the barn? A day like today you should be out hitting a golf course.
are you kidding me? You been out there?
you don't call. You don't write.
Eddie. How you doing?
fine. Fine.
so? How's Sophie and Clark?
they're good. They're all good, yeah.
spike. You still wear the rookie badge?
Nah-uh. This is, uh, Sam Braddock. He's new, but he's trying.
good to meet you, I'm Danny.
hot call, Team One, gear up.
what do we got?
suspicious package. Train station, south terminal.
babycakes, I'm coming! - Take it easy, Danny.
let's go!
Hey, Danny!
keep the peace, boys.
who called it in?
the security guard. He says the suitcase has been there almost an hour.
copy that.
we gotta keep that perimeter wide. We gotta keep it locked down.
Hey, who's that guy at the station?
Danny Rangford. Most decent, honest cop I've ever met in my life.
guy's a legend, retired about a year ago.
he's the guy that brought me into the SRU.
you? - Yeah. Him and Barney Fletcher, the two of 'em, they fought to have us trained in psychology and negotiation.
if it wasn't for them, we'd be straight-up SWAT.
so he was commander?
never made it past sergeant. Avoided promotion.
Why?
keeps you in the action.
thought maybe it was the booze.
you didn't smell it off him?
you new? - Three weeks.
uh, look, do you know if anyone's using the briefing room in the next little while?
Mmm, I don't think so. Team Three's gone off shift. Team One's out.
good. I just want to get a few things in order. Is it okay if I use the room?
go ahead.
I'm just gonna have a walkabout first. Is that okay?
strategic Response Unit.
okay.
morning, Sergeant.
inspector Stainton, what's the word?
we're not liking this. There's been a spike in terrorist chat last two weeks.
station sees over 200, 000 commuters a day.
I say that's "hotspot" written all over it.
Sam, north containment.
Lewis, west. Wordy, east.
spike, do your thing. Jules, second the boss.
stay connected. We're gonna need everyone's brain on this one.
let's get to know our friend.
Kira, can I trouble you a sec?
there's a, uh, file I've been meaning to look at.
a file?
Yeah, it's #5512.
you'll find it under Team Four, 1989.
okay. What's this in regard to?
uh, just getting a presentation together.
you know, old boys on the lecture circuit.
uh, it's probably not on a computer.
uh, look, if it's any trouble I can always go down to the archives myself.
Oh, no, no, no, it's no trouble. I just need to clear it with Commander Holleran.
uh, what do you need to do that for?
Oh, I just can't release files without permission. It's policy.
uh, well, well, it's not like it's a breech of, uh, anyone's privacy.
I-I mean, it was a case of my own. I was there.
sorry. Officially, you're a civilian now. So.
no. You don't need to do that.
look, the old days, one of us at the desk, you know
we'd have looked the other way.
well, I'm sure Commander Holleran...
you're not hearing me.
I didn't come this far.
stay quiet. - But I can just...
just stay quiet. And look down, hmm?
I need that file. Do you understand?
Yep.
let's go, darling.
10: 36 a. m.: suspicious suitcase.
constable Scarlatti initiating electronic counter measures.
I'll wait here. You go on and get the file. Fast is good.
wait. I'll take that.
sorry.
okay, know the subject, anticipate the weapon, target the solution.
what kind of person plants a bomb in a public place?
organized personality, not impulsive, not mentally incompetent.
emotionally detached, above average intelligence.
access to volatile material. and familiar with its use.
Yeah, and who wants to strike the city's transportation hub.
or just doesn't like tourists.
okay, everyone, eyes and ears open.
we may be dealing with an individual who likes to hang around and watch the carnage.
wasn't supposed to go this way, you know?
wasn't supposed to go this way.
could have just given it to me.
all I need to do was go in the briefing room, get a little work done, undisturbed.
I'll make sure you're not interrupted.
well, maybe you're not trained for this at your desk, but where I came from we're trained to profile people, and here's what I get from you: you're ambitious;
you're serious about your job; you don't want to be passive, be perceived as the victim.
so here's what you'll do: I walk into that briefing room, you'll sound the alarm first chance you get.
I try walking out of here, same problem.
man with a gun making unorthodox demands. You see my dilemmas? Smile.
Hey, Kira.
any word on the air conditioning?
tomorrow.
sergeant Rangford?
you hear I made sergeant? Team Three.
so you haunting the old barn? - Yeah.
sit down. Sit. Sit.
okay, confirming no visible identification.
Babycakes is sending out a signal blocking out remote detonators.
going to start with the infrared.
good news so far. Nothing unusual in the heat patterns.
going to try chemical detection for any nerve agents, blood agents.
sergeant.
inspector, anything good?
some of the people that reported the case said they smelled hay nearby.
so? Hay?
moist hay.
one woman said she smelled freshly cut grass.
Stainton, so what are you saying? That someone stuffed the case with hay?
boss. Hay and grass aren't the only things that smell like hay and grass.
those people that smelled hay and grass?
track them down, they gotta be put under medical observation immediately.
no physical exertion or it'll accelerate the spread.
spike, what do you think it is?
phosgene. It could be phosgene.
by the time you smell it, it's already at its lethal level.
you and Michelle finally gonna take that round-the-world trip she kept asking for?
well... maybe.
little hot in that?
Yeah.
you know what? No, I'm-I'm good. I'm good.
anything I can help you with there, Daniel?
I'm fine, Troy. I'm really fine.
I just want to be left alone, okay?
I don't think that's a good idea.
stand down!
stay back!
stay back! - Hey, sergeant?
keep it cool, guys. Everything's okay.
okay, Troy, you're going to keep your boys at a distance.
sure. Sure, Daniel.
you know how this works, boys.
Kira? Kira, did you try to transmit?
what's up, Jules? - I don't know.
this is not the way it was supposed to happen, you know.
never is, right? - No.
look at me. I'm the subject.
you don't have to be, Daniel. We can work this out.
sorry, Troy.
wait. She's sending something through.
team ONE HOT CALL...
Sarge.
IMMBDIATE
Kira? Kira, you copy?
Jules, you're in charge.
all right. - Lean on Stainton if you need to.
Eddie, we got a priority call.
I need you, Sam and Wordy to come with me.
Louis, you cover Spike.
Jules, let's get extra uniforms and detectives.
copy that. I'm on it.
ed, the priority call... it's at the station.
why don't you tell me what's...
don't... negotiate me.
now, go in here.
I'm gonna shut the door.
I'm barricading myself in. You understand what that means, don't you, Troy?
I do.
and you're gonna leave me to my own devices.
otherwise, the situation is going to get dangerous. You know that, right?
right.
I want you to consider me a threat level red.
you got that? - I got it, boss.
I'm gonna stop talking now.
threat level red. Can you say that for me?
threat level red.
that's good.
doing a good job, Troy.
it's Daniel Rangford. He's armed, and he's barricaded himself in the briefing room.
boss. - Talk.
he's got a Beretta, . 40 cal.
panels hold up to that?
Yeah, yeah, they're polycarb. - So, what's he doing in there?
he disabled a security camera.
he hasn't talked since he shut himself in there.
classified himself a threat level red.
negotiated me like I was a rookie.
are you surprised?
can your team cover the entrances?
Yeah, we're all we got, though.
most of my guys already clocked out.
Yeah, we're down three. The rest of us are dealing with the bomb threat.
you want me to call my guys back in?
Yes. - No.
boss, we keep this in the family. We can handle it.
okay, Eddie.
nobody gets in through the front. Garage access only.
I'm assuming he's closed the blinds, but we still need eyes in, so grab some range finders.
go outside and double-check. - Copy that.
Wordy, he's gonna be looking for the snake, so let's use the fiber cam.
got it.
Auto-transcriptor, boss?
we don't need it.
Jules has it anyway.
it could just be for us or... - Or what, Greg?
we could decide that when this thing is over, okay?
all right. Let's use Team Three's.
you set it up, but call his wife first. Her name is Michelle.
let's figure out what's been going on at home lately, okay?
on it. - Okay.
I want you to talk to him, okay?
none of us can stay objective, but you know him best.
Yeah.
all right, good. Kira, walk with me.
so, what do we know about phosgene?
it's not hard to make, and it's nasty.
could take 24 hours to show symptoms, so your victims don't even know they've been exposed until their lungs stop working.
okay, well, Stainton's on top of the med reports.
I'll tell him to alert his units for a potential chemical evac order.
maybe we need to block incoming trains as well. Anything else?
get him to broaden the perimeter, especially downwind.
got it.
okay, Babycakes. Let's take a look inside.
what's this I'm hearing about you being in there with a gun, huh?
telling Troy it's threat level red?
Danny, come on.
last time we talked, threat level red was code for "there's a wife in the station."
it's just me out here, Danny. It's Eddie.
Kira, what happened? He seemed fine when we left. I mean, how did he seem to you?
calm at first. Well, sweating a lot.
Yeah, well, we all are, right?
but steady eye contact, relaxed posture, chatty.
then, when I wouldn't get the file for him, he came off the rails like that wasn't the plan.
what do you think the plan was?
didn't add up: getting the file, preparing a presentation in the briefing room.
he wanted privacy.
think he wanted to leave the station with that file?
no, I don't think so.
and he didn't want Holleran alerted, right? - That's right.
remember anything about the file?
name in it was Gehring, 1989.
89, so there's no computer backup. Anything about that case?
just that it was his. Sorry.
no, no, you did everything right, Kira. Thank you.
you can go home. You're free to do that.
Hey, I'm not going anywhere. I'm a cop, too.
okay. Put on a vest and radio.
call Harvey Silver.
his name and number is on file. He was on Daniel's team.
they retired the same year. Tell him we need him here sooner than ASAP.
Eddie, how is our friend?
he's not talking.
I got eyes in.
fiber optic neutralized.
Troy, you got eyes outside?
he's moving. Looks like he's closing the shutters.
want to try the ball cam?
he's gonna be looking for that. Let's get thermals.
okay, I got it right here.
you sticky my fiber-optic camera?
nice job. What did you use, duct tape?
forgot how much you liked it low-tech.
remember that corner store barricade?
Danny, day like today, hotter than hell. You remember that?
you had me talk to those kids for an hour and half, Danny. Then, you came in.
turned up the heat. 20 minutes later, they came running out.
that was low-tech all the way.
thought you were on a bomb call, Ed.
we're on it. Just came back here to see what was going on.
I'm not here to negotiate you, Danny.
I just want to help you figure it out.
all you've done for me over the years. Come on.
go back to your bomb call.
Frank's on it, Danny. You know the bomb guys.
you know what's good for you, you stay out of there.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm gonna stay right here long as it takes.
Danny, what are you saying to me? How long?
about 14 more ounces.
11: 27 a. m. Barricaded subject, Daniel Rangford.
boss, how do you want me to characterize the subject?
barricaded. Leave it at that.
you talk to his wife?
Yes, I called her.
I told her her husband was at the station, and she got really upset; she hung up on me.
it's all you. - Boss, come and see this.
he's shooting at nothing. He's shooting at a chair. I got thermals.
on the ground.
on the ground!
Danny, our weapons are not raised. We are not here to hurt you.
down... down!
Danny, talk to me.
Danny, it's Greg Parker.
what's going on, buddy? What are you shooting at?
what's going on? - I don't know.
he's shooting at somebody who's not there.
is it hallucination?
Yeah, maybe flashbacks or something.
where is Daniel? I want to see him. Where is he?
what the hell is going on, guys?
no one through the front. - Ma'am, you cannot go in there.
Sam, Sam, it's okay. Michelle.
I want to see him. Where is he?
let's just walk over here for a second. - Where is he?
we can talk about it over here. Let's just walk over here.
I want to see him. You bastard, you bastard.
it's your fault. You do this to him, all of you. You bastard!
just calm down. It's okay. It's okay.
just go with Kira, and we'll find you a place to sit down, okay?
and I promise I will come to you as soon as I can, okay?
Michelle, let's sit down. It's gonna be okay.
boss. Take a look.
all right, that's enough. I'm gonna open it up.
he said he was gonna fire.
you want to spend the rest of your life thinking about what we shouldhave done, Wordy, huh?
Wordy, cover. Sam, we're opening up.
okay, boss. - Okay, go.
I told you not to come in!
let's slow this down, Danny.
close the damn door!
I'm not gonna be able to do that, Dan.
one step closer, we're done.
okay.
let the subject set the pace.
don't rush a negotiation.
cause I'm not finished here.
and I'm going to get this thing, right. Okay, Eddie?
okay.
back off.
boss?
I'll go talk to Michelle.
I think he's slowing up, so let's just keep him on his timetable, okay?
okay.
he's arriving now.
Harvey, I'm Sam, Team One.
where is he? I want to see him.
that's not gonna happen.
I got to talk to him. He'll listen to me.
Harvey, this isn't a good idea.
this is garbage. I can't just stand here.
Harvey, there's not a guy here who feels different, but we just need to streamline the inputs a little, okay?
ed Lane is with him now.
Eddie's with him? - Yeah.
okay. - Okay... good, we need your help.
we need you to rember everything you can about the Gehring incident in 1989.
this is not good.
we got a possible IED. Batteries, wire, pipe.
is that shrapnel?
it could be; it's not nails or ball bearings... some kind of small objects, though.
this thing could be on a timer.
it could be motion-sensitive, so we're not taking it anywhere.
we detonate it here in the square?
negative. Detonating will only release more gas.
we do a render-safe with the water cannon.
okay. We got to disrupt the mechanism.
and turn the phosgene into hydrochloric acid.
I promise you'll see him as soon as we know it's safe.
safe?
Michelle, we need to understand what he's doing, where he's coming from.
can you help us?
Yeah, of course I'll help.
thank you, 'cause, um...
cause you're the one who knows them best.
you think?
I know the guy I married. I remember him. This guy?
I mean, I was counting the days till he retired.
till he came back to us.
to me and Liam.
wake up to the world.
have a barbeque, put up his feet.
enjoy something.
didn't work out that way, huh?
no.
cause when he took off the uniform, it turns out there was nothing left underneath.
almost there.
all right, we've just got to get past the part of him that sticks to a plan.
so maybe we bypass the logic brain, force him to run out of there.
thinking about tear gas?
the animal instinct in the midbrain thinks it's Johnny run for air.
I don't recommend it.
Why's that, Danny?
you're going to have to evacuate the whole building for three days just to breathe in here.
three weeks with a sanitation crew.
we're not worried about making messes, Danny.
think it through, boys.
want to cripple the SRU?
all on the gamble that I didn't think of, uh, packing a gas mask in this bag?
does he let you touch him?
no, he doesn't.
and I don't mean just in bed.
I try to hold his hand, he pulls away.
the last time he touched me, I woke up with his hands around my neck and he was screaming at me.
he's been hanging off a cliff these years.
he won't talk to me.
not about work, he never has.
and he won't talk to you.
cause he knows.
you'll shake your heads,"Oh, so sad to see the great guy fall.
what happened to him? We thought he could hack it.
and you'll turn your backs so that you can keep on pretending that he's the exception.
Michelle, it's going to be okay. It's okay.
Danny. We are not playing chess here, now.
you're thinking about a permanent solution to a temporary problem.
I appreciate your faith, Ed, but...
right, then you've got to appreciate...
don't interrupt the subject! - Don't handbook me, Danny.
Danny, faith is what you need when there's no proof.
we don't need faith to know that you deserve to live.
Oh, yeah? That's something you can prove?
Yeah. Yeah, I think I can.
let's talk about all the people whose lives were made longer because of you.
don't start.
the Gehring incident. It was a home invasion.
Regent Park, but this little place was neat as a pin. You know who's keeping house?
little 18-year-old.
parents are both deadbeats; one's in jail; one's AWOL;
and she's holding it all together, looking after her little brother and sister.
what happened with the home invasion?
by the time we got on scene, the bad guys had gone.
the girl, she'd taken a whack at one of the guys with a baseball bat, scared him away.
so the team went back out on patrol, and Danny and I stayed behind to write it up.
that was it?
the little guy, ten years old, wanted to show us his baseball card collection.
I said,"No, we've got to go." And Danny says, "No. Let's stay."
he just bought a fresh pack for his own son, went out to the truck to get them.
we sat crossed-legs on the floor.
middle of the afternoon, summer day...
trading baseball cards with little guy...
it was good.
you remember this pretty clear for such a long time ago.
Yeah, well, you would.
two hours later, it wasn't our file anymore. It was Homicide's.
that little girl down by the dock. Remember her?
she was turning blue.
you could hardly breathe and you did mouth-to-mouth on her in the ambulance, all the way to the hospital. Buddy, you saved her life.
you stayed with her the whole time and then they called from the hospital.
to say,"Congratulations. She's gonna live."
Danny, you got the Silver Shield for that, buddy.
proudest freakin' nine seconds of my career.
cause then they give the punch line, which is something we don't tell the rookies, hmm?
about how the girl was brain-damaged from lack of oxygen.
Oh, yeah, she's going to live, like a vegetable, shriveling up until her family decides to pull the plug and put her out of her misery.
which I've got to say, seems to be a good idea right about now.
I know you're self-esteeming me like crazy here, but you know what?
that's the last thing I need right now. That's the last thing.
excuse me. - Okay, Danny. All right.
let's take a break.
he's almost at the bottom of that bottle.
the more we talk, the faster he drinks. Let's just...
take a little pressure off, okay?
boss, I'm not going to leave him.
all right, you stay. You stay, but let him do his thing.
okay. - I need to find out what's going on in that file.
okay.
we get the homicide file yet?
squad car's flying it over.
give you a deadline?
Yeah, what's left of his bottle of scotch.
Harvey, what do you remember?
two victims: older sister, younger boy.
perps got away.
tragic as hell, but it's nothing we don't see.
Yeah, but why did this one get to him? What was different about it?
did you ever talk to him about it?
I don't know. You know how it goes. I might've asked him how he was doing?
What'd he say?
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
inspector, we're getting ready to counter the package here.
no one comes close.
perimeter is locked up.
Thanks.
Danny, you thirsty at all in there?
Danny? A little water, buddy. I'm going to roll it in there, okay?
no surprises.
nice and easy.
incoming from Homicide.
Gehring, Jeremy, August 8, 1989.
august 8. - That's today.
find out why.
we got a witness tape.
all right, dig out a VCR. Let's get some answers.
Oh, you've got to be kidding me. It's Beta.
Oh, he's almost finished that bottle. I'm going to open it up.
are you sure?
Yeah, we need more access.
Sam, I need you. Troy, grab your guys.
we're going to open this up.
what's happening?
Michelle, I need you to stay out of range.
I won't hide in there anymore. He's my husband.
you know what? You're right. You're right. I want you to come with me.
I want you to hide behind the shields, and I want you to stay close.
all right, we ready? We ready? Sam.
Danny? Listen to me, man. Don't do it!
Danny, put the gun down!
Danny? Michelle's here!
what are you doing? You can't be here. Get out of here! You shouldn't be here!
I'm not going anywhere, Daniel.
get her out of here!
I'm not going anywhere!
don't make me do this in front of her!
Danny, just listen to me now.
get her out! Get her out of here!
Danny, put that gun down.
we're not leaving you, Danny! We're not leaving you!
go on!
in five, four, three... two, one.
fire in the hole.
hold fire. - Hold fire.
Daniel! Please!
Michelle, he's not going to hurt me.
he's not going to hurt me. Are you, Danny?
crossing the line. You think I won't do it?
cardinal rule. Gun's pointed at an officer.
sometimes you've got to break the rules, Danny, remember?
remember who taught me that?
I'll do it.
I'll do it. - I have the solution.
Wordy, damn it, go.
no, no. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
you know what you've got to do.
you've got to keep safe.
you ever seen this before? Do you have any idea?
no. No.
you're going to hide.
it starts here.
do what Jeremy told me to do.
he told me to stay under the bed.
so I didn't see them.
but you think they might have been the same men that had come before?
don't know why they came back.
cause he said we'd be okay.
who said you'd be okay, Petra?
the policeman with the baseball cards.
he, he said we'd be okay. Then he went away.
but he didn't know that they'd come back, Petra.
but maybe he did.
because, because he told Jeremy.
what do you mean, "He told Jeremy"?
he said,"You know what you've got to do."
you've got to be brave and show your sisters.
and so Jeremy wanted to be brave so he could save me and my sister.
but it didn't work. It didn't work.
boss, we got something. Home invaders came back.
boy stepped up to protect his sisters, Daniel and his team were done.
Daniel didn't do anything wrong.
it was something he told the boy.
Yeah,"You know what you gotta do? You gotta hide."
no, that's not what he said. He said,"You know what you gotta do?
you gotta show your sisters you're brave."
what was the boy's name?
okay, thanks. - You hide like that.
shell, you got to go.
you can't see this.
Daniel, I'm not leaving you!
Daniel, let's talk about Jeremy.
the file you wanted.
I'm guessing it was about Jeremy, right?
cause today's the day. Isn't it? August 8?
it's funny those days that stick in our minds.
guessing that Jeremy was a pretty brave kid.
but I don't know that for sure.
could you, could you help me out with that one?
Danny, you can't do this.
you can't do this without...
without telling us why!
I know...
I know...
about a kid sitting on the floor.
I went back.
he didn't look any different from the last time we saw him.
his eyes were open.
he's looking at me, baseball cards spread around him, but he's real quiet.
he's real still and I'm thinking, "Why is he so still?
Why? Why doesn't he say,'hi'?
then I see it.
he had a screwdriver buried into his throat.
and I put it there.
you didn't put it there, Danny. Criminals put it there.
if I hadn't been called there, I wouldn't have said that to him.
"you got to be brave for your sisters."
if it wasn't me, he would've lived.
you don't know that, buddy.
I spent my whole career screwing up.
being too late, being too early, not saying the right words.
I spent my whole career looking at the worst 20 minutes of other people's lives and I can't take it anymore.
Danny, how about rembering the good stuff?
the good stuff-- all the lives you saved.
all the people whose lives were made better, the lives that were made longer because you were there for those 20 minutes.
I can't remember, you see? I can't remember! I can't remember!
all I see are the ghosts.
all I got are the ghosts. The ghosts.
I can't take it anymore.
please.
please help me.
pull the plug.
pull the plug. - Okay, wait.
No!
okay.
Danny, this isn't about Jeremy.
these guys think it's all about him, but it's more than that.
isn't it?
Jeremy's just who we always think about.
I get it.
I get it.
you know what, buddy?
every time...
every time I look at a damn scope, I see a kid run across.
I see a spray of blood.
you know what else, Danny?
you know what else I see?
all the calls we didn't get to in time.
the mothers that we couldn't talk down.
the kid who thought it'd be fun to pull a gun on a cop.
you're not the only one who sees ghosts, Danny.
I got to tell you, I don't know where to put them anymore either.
Eddie, please, no.
you taught me everything I know.
you made me who I am, Danny.
you can't... You can't tell me...
that this is how it ends.
you can't. Give me that gun.
it's gonna be okay.
stand down. Stand down.
it was harmless.
they just wanted to keep us busy.
silver
inspector Stainton, those witnesses are free to go.
hay and grass.
I'm going to take you to a place.
a place I've been myself.
and we're gonna get through this.
we're gonna get through this.
strategic
I thought we were gonna keep this one in the family.
Yeah, families and secrets, you know?
I don't think that's such a good thing.
I'm sorry.
it's Ed Lane I want.
okay, okay. Let me start working on that.
working on that?
well, yeah, he's out of range. I got to track him down.
he's standing next to you.
eight-- is that enou? - Yep.
you still have Santorini blue on your hand.
got to use the thinner.
Yeah, maybe if you left me some.
I'll bring you some more tonight.
flowers, bottle of thinner.
"instant" romance.
Hey, by the way, it's not Santorini blue; it's Santorini sky.
guys done with the restock?
Yeah.
we're meeting in the briefing room.
okay.
Jules, how, uh... how are the renovations coming?
one room left.
a renovation ahead of schedule. Wow, you getting any help?
no.
come on.
your own two hands... that's amazing. That's got to feel good.
Yeah, it does.
okay.
Hi, it's Luka. Leave a message.
I'll leave a key for you. Take anything you want.
I just have one favor to ask.
look at you.
got three hours till vacation.
someone's already on the dock with his fishing rod and his nice, cold beer.
what? I'm right here for you, buddy. You know why?
no "I" in "team.
that's good. You can take the next crank call, kick some swatter ass before you go.
go for Ed.
go for your beleaguered wife.
Hey, I thought you said you were gonna pack your own clothes.
they were wet.
you know that big thing beside the, uh... washing machine? It's called a...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Are you gonna pick me up at noon or what?
Yeah, as soon as Clark's done music camp.
Hey, where are the fishing rods?
so, they're in the car. I packed them myself.
Ah, he packs the fun stuff.
you gonna be done shift on time?
Yeah, as long as we don't get swatted again.
what's that?
we're getting a bunch of 911s from fake caller IDs.
I just busted in on an old lady having a cup of tea.
well, how about this?
you're late, and I'll swat you.
nice. Long as you promise to wear that old lady dress that I like so much.
good-bye.
okay, I know it's been a long day.
it's been a long ten-day shift.
a few more hours. Let's just keep it together, okay?
now, three swatter calls in a day.
a little hinky.
hinky? Boss, it's starting to feel personal.
I hear you.
Kira's trying to do some digging around, see if she can find a connection, but in the meantime, what do we do if we get another call? Any suggestions?
if a real call comes in, we split up.
we don't want to be jammed up in the wrong end of the city chasing our tails, right?
that's good: splinter unit.
splinter unit for anything unconfirmed.
Wordy, you're in charge of that.
the two of you ride along if it smells like another prank; the rest of us...
let's stay here on standby.
hit the gym, do target practice. Do something. Let's get it out.
all right.
I have no choice. This is what war is.
your father gave me no choice.
that... that's my bus.
I'm sorry for you.
I'm sorry for everything.
it's terrible to be at war.
don't blame me. Blame your father.
so, what do you guys say? Parking lot hoops? Game of 21?
when's the last time you ever got 21?
afraid of losing to a family man, huh?
Hey, Clark, how you doing, buddy?
look... Look, slow down, slow down. Just...
no, just start from the beginning. Clark?
boss, I just got off the phone with Clark.
what happened?
some guy came up to him on the street, started talking crap about me, about how this is war.
don't blame him; blame me.
Hey, sit down. Sit down.
is Clark okay?
he's okay.
I'm sure it's nothing. But why don't you go anyway.
you sure? I was gonna ask...
Yeah, we're covered. It's slow. You're going on vacation.
you are going on vacation, right? - I'm going on vacation, yeah.
so, go see your son. Get out of town before the traffic hits.
all right, be safe. I'll see you.
all right, have fun.
think he knows? - Who?
Sarge.
Yes, I think he knows.
Why?
you have blue paint on your ear.
well, we might as well just tell him now. Get it over with.
I'll do it. I don't care.
Yeah, and then what? One of us gets transferred to another team?
these guys are my family.
not just yours.
doesn't mean I want to give you up.
what?
team 1, hot call at Nathan Phillips Square.
repeat: hot call.
that's City Hall, boss.
I hear it... Kira?
reports of shots fired. Multiple witnesses.
not a prank?
no, sir. I've got Inspector Stainton on the line.
let's see what's going on.
inspector?
Seeant, we got onserious situation here.
tell me.
one injured: City Hall security guard's been shot in the leg, and we're pinned in here real bad.
how many shots fired?
three, four... they're coming every two minutes.
honest to God, we don't know where they're coming from.
you clear all the civilians, four-block radius?
we're doing the best we can. It's summertime in the city.
okay, we'll be right there. Containment is the priority.
I'll call you back in three.
Kira, call Team 4. All hands on deck.
Eddie? - Trucks are loaded.
okay, boys, let's keep the peace.
keep it close to the car.
let's get some shields.
heads down.
they're pinned behind the car.
how is the victim doing, Inspector?
he's holding on.
let's give him some cover.
get him inside so the EMT can get to him.
it's been a nightmare; we got no idea where these shots are coming from.
and how are we doing on containment?
we've evacuated all civilians into the underground lots, but you got people coming in and out of all these buildings.
shooter's active.
like clockwork, every two minutes.
Lou? - I'm on it.
acoustic locat's gonna nail his position as soon as he shoots again.
beyond the security guard, there's no other injuries.
thank God this guy's not a pro.
Wordy, you get a look at the wound.
Yeah. The exit wound's lower than the entry.
means he's shooting from up top.
okay, it's a target-rich environment that's almost uncontainable.
I got no one to talk down.
any word from counterterrorism?
no, I'm telling you, no chatter, no warning, no nothing.
this guy's come from of nowhere.
okay, Spike, you stay in the Command Truck.
you run all the maps and the intelligence, all information flows through you.
copy.
okay, I'm looking at 300-meter radius on the 3-D.
buildings are dense. Lots of places he can be, lots of angles.
we got to try to narrow it down.
find out where the shots are coming from.
Locaters are online, so we got ears.
let's see if we can get any clues.
Louis, Wordy. - We'll do witnesses.
all right, you press them for details.
I need to know where that shot came from. - Copy.
the way the victim fell, did he spin, did he crumple?
any visible shimmers, muzzle flashes, reflection, movement.
Sam, Jules, let's break it down. Came from the south.
we got a lot of options here. Where would you go?
clock tower, classic, lots of shadows, good concealment.
building under construction, lots of visual distraction...
buddy must be lucky or he knows what a sner locator looks like.
he's located himself.
ricochet directly through the target to the point of origin.
the hotel. - Could be the roof.
any of those top floors. A lot of tinted windows.
let's start with the roof.
active shooter, we go to him.
okay. I'm gonna brief the Chief. I'll be in the truck.
all right, use the overhang for cover.
how many seconds from his last shot?
60 seconds.
Sam, grab a shield. Let's go. Go! Go!
I'm going to cover you.
if you don't think you can make it, wait till he fires again.
copy that.
spike, count us down.
two minutes, right?
copy. Over two minutes now.
all right, he's breaking his pattern.
maybe we're getting warm.
or he's moved.
where would you go next, it was you?
clock tower's a no-brainer.
right there.
all those vents, visual distractions, clean view of the square, boss.
okay, see it. Inspector?
yeah?
clock tower-- lock up the whole southeast quadrant.
copy that.
no one in or out. SRU only. - Done.
we got a chopper coming in to sweep the rooftops.
you want a long-range, precision weapon against a big noisy target?
I'll call it off. - Thanks.
almost there.
somebody opened those doors.
we're thinking he's moved, but if he hasn't, you're looking at booby traps, ambush, suicide, suicide by cop.
maximum caution.
our friend hit a seven-inch target from 400 meters.
roof's clear. He's not up here.
but he was.
it's a 762. Carbon Striations.
he's got an HK G3. That's nasty.
shields are safe, but that'll crack body armor.
this hotel has 43 floors.
Stainton's got uniforms sweeping the interiors.
the rooftops are up to us.
clock tower's next.
copy that.
Wordy, Louis, any luck with the witnesses?
you haven't seen anything, have you?
nothing we don't already know.
all right, move on. Next highest building, City Hall, both rooftops.
copy that. On our way.
spike, get forensics up to the hotel roof.
right now we're doing everything we can.
Yes, sir. Every step of the way. Yeah. Bye.
Hey, way to start your vacation.
team 3, I need access.
we kept the elevator open for you.
what a scene, huh? I don't get it. I really don't.
what kind of a person would do something like that?
thank you. - Good luck.
Tactically?
we can't do anything until... - Until he starts shooting again.
okay, so help me out. Who is this guy?
criminal sharpshooter. I mean, usually, it's military or law enforcement...
Yeah, but this guy doesn't seem to be hitting his mark.
he's trying hard not to, right?
a dozen shots, only one injury, what are the odds, right?
hit the locator pretty good.
okay, let's assume he knows what he's doing.
typical profile? Tyrannical sadist.
antisocial, wants to play God, wants control, wants to see innocent people suffer.
except...
except there's only one injury, not much of a sadist.
maybe it's targeted. Maybe it's revenge. Maybe it's... maybe it's personal.
that's what Wordy said in the briefing room, right? Feels like it's personal.
three swatter calls, one shift. That's a first.
this guy's trying to wear us out. It's urban warfare strategy.
you hit the army when they're tired returning from battle.
all right, I'm going to check with Kira, see if she tracked down those swatter calls.
uniforms are sweeping the hotel.
we're heading to the clock tower.
Kira forwarded the sound files from 911 calls this morning.
they come from different phone numbers?
Yeah, but it sounds like spoofing to me.
Spoofing?
seems it's perfectly legal to impersonate another caller ID if it's "for entertainment purposes only."
Oh, my God, he's going to shoot me!
they guarantee privacy.
they don't release clients' names.
it's my friend. He says he's going to shoot himself.
for a little extra they'll messith the pitch of your voice.
help, please, put the gun down!
you hear that? Three voices, one accent.
eastern European? - Ed.
personal. First York.
no way. - No choice.
it's not me, it's youfather. This is war.
how did Clark describe the guy at the bus stop today?
Yeah, European accent. Young guy. - Eddie.
no way.
call your family. - All right.
team, listen up, We think we know who this guy is.
thing staying at school.
just sit tight, buddy.
sit tight till Mom gets there.
okay, I love you, too.
Kira, get my wife and kid to the station and lock down the SRU.
okay, mid-20s, dark hair, ordinary-looking. Spoke with an accent.
I know. - You shot his father.
he was close enough to feel the bullet fly.
he took me to court for wrongful death.
and he lost.
Yeah. - Okay.
Kira, Spike, I need you to pull up a wrongful death lawsuit.
last name: Tomasic.
copy that. I'm also sending out a photograph of the subject.
news footage of First York.
boss, I've got his employment records.
next of kin?
that's his father. He's deceased. Any emergency contacts?
here, I got a cell number.
okay, let's get that guy here immediately.
let's send a squad car.
guys, what are we doing here?
we've ID'd the subject. We're looking for him.
he's camouflaged, or he's hiding.
and what's the next step?
we get in his head; we anticipate his next move.
until then... wait till he shoots again.
terrific.
uniforms have locked down the entrances to the south buildings.
Wordy, Lou, how you guys doing on the City Hall towers?
rooftops are clear.
going to the mechanical room.
where are you?
just looking for my tennis racket. You almost ready?
listen, there's a squad car going to come by. It's going to pick you up.
a squad car? Why?
Sophie, it's just a precaution, okay?
I'm sorry. I'll explain as soon as I can.
Yeah. Yeah, okay.
I love you.
I love you, too.
we got to find this guy now.
Yeah, Spike found a photo.
the guy's name is Petar Tomasic.
quit his job two weeks ago, and no one's answering the phone at his apartment.
guys, subject is confirmed. Petar Tomasic.
26 year-old, Caucasian, dark hair.
Sam, Jules, where are you?
we're heading up the clock tower.
sweeping floor by floor.
nothing here, Ed.
copy. Sam, Wordy, Louis, what's your 20?
clearing the mechanical room.
heading to the East Tower.
all right, keep talking to us.
Eddie, Luka Boblic is here. He was on scene.
you might want to listen in.
Luka, this is Ed Lane.
I know who you are. - You know why you're here?
Petar left a message on my phone.
I heard on the radio what was happening.
I came down as fast as I could.
no one would let me through.
Petar left a message?
he said, uh, good-bye.
I knew something was coming.
where is he?
that's just it; we don't know.
so, let's start with the basics, okay?
does Petar have access to a gun?
I-I don't know.
last week he told me he was thinking about getting a rifle from some guy, black market.
I don't know who.
when I heard that, I said, Petar, you do this, I swear, I'll turn you in myself.
he told me to forget it. He was just kidding.
I believed him.
I believed him.
this isn't your fault, Luka.
okay, he made his own choice here today.
but you can still help him.
he was...
so angry at everything, everyone.
he thinks you ruined his life.
did he say what kind of rifle it was?
I don't know.
does he know how to shoot it?
does your friend know how to shoot a rifle?
snipers were how we protected ourselves.
Petar shot eight men dead before he was 16.
croatia, it was a civil war, sir.
Petar Tomasic was one of the best snipers in our country.
we were like brothers; we were little kids together; we grew up together.
so, what happened?
Petar got recruited by the local militia.
he fought alongside his father against the Serbs.
everyone called him "Mali Sniperist"-- Baby Sniper.
he protected our village.
subject is a skilled sniper, familiar with urban warfare.
if he was missing his mark, he was missing it on purpose.
guys, this is a revenge situation.
good news: We've narrowed it down.
he's looking for me.
I killed his father at First York Plaza.
two years, I was at school, he was hiding in the hills, fighting our enemies.
until they found out who he was.
they didn't come after him. They came after his family.
they tortured his mother and they killed her and...
and he nearly went crazy.
but his father saved him.
they escaped through two countries on foot.
so, the woman that, um, that was shot at First York?
his stepmother.
boss?
Yeah, Kira.
you were right. Spoofing network confirmed all three 911s were routed through them from the same client.
but they don't want to release the client's name without a subpoena.
want me to play bad cop on them?
no, thanks, Kira. I think we may have what we need right here.
copy that.
Luka， if we can talk to him, we may be able to stop him from harming anybody else.
I know his cell number.
Petar, it's Greg Parker with the Police Strategic Response Unit.
thank you very much for picking up.
Petar? Petar, I think it's important that we start talking.
Why?
maybe I can help you if I can understand what you're looking for.
I know what I'm lookg for.
Oh, yeah?
it's Ed Lane I want.
okay, okay, let me start working on that.
working on that?
well, yeah, he's out of range. I got to track him down.
he's standing next to you.
I guess you can see everything, huh, Petar?
like you.
you can hear everything.
you can see everything.
almost.
what do you mean? What does that mean?
officer down! Officer down!
well, we waited till he shot again, didn't we, Sergeant?
that kid was 24 years of age.
fresh out of police academy.
you tell me how we could've prevented that! You tell me!
you want to call the Chief on this?
you call him, you explain it!
no, no, I want to settle this thing.
confirm Team 4 is containing east buildings.
can't tell where the sound came from.
could be any building in this range.
he's using these curved walls.
refracting the sound, he's covering his tracks.
he's in the vicinity.
he's accelerating to get a response and he's targeting law enforcement.
he can see me and he's trying to draw me out.
boss, if you get him back on the phone, keep him on it; I can try tracking his position.
copy that.
knew my dad was a cop, right?
I thought he was a farmer.
Yeah, well, before that he was a cop.
remember the Tower Sniper?
Yeah, 40 years ago, guy in a clock tower?
he killed 16 people that day.
cops couldn't get to him.
they didn't have the tools or the training.
when it was all over with, they decided they were gonna do something about it.
you're kidding. Your dad was part of the first SWAT teams?
no, he was one of the cops that couldn't do anything.
he bought a farm in the prairies and raised me and my brothers away from it all.
so, I guess he wasn't exactly thrilled that you became a cop.
we got to get this guy.
you know what? He's not answering.
Luka, you mind calling him on your own phone? - No.
boss, boss, the subject's already volatile.
you sure we want to bring in a third party now?
Yeah, we're out of time.
and you think the kid can talk to him?
no, but he can keep him on the line long enough for Spike to get a lock on where he is.
okay. - Luka...
Luka, if you get him talking, think past his plan to the bigger picture.
you said you were like brothers, right? - Right.
team, we're bringing in a TPI. Put it on speaker. Spike, I'm coming in.
English.
what good is this going to do?
you know what they did.
you know what I have to do.
he promised me it'd be different here, but it's not.
come on. Come on.
I got used to not being afraid.
you don't need to be afraid.
they told me no one will be hurt.
that's what they said before he shot my father.
tell them I want Ed Lane to come out.
or more people will die!
phone's dead. - Doesn't matter. I got it.
where? - Right there.
he's on the roof.
that was locked down. How'd he get in?
Jules, Wordy, meet me at the southeast corner, Bay and Queen.
copy.
on our way.
let's stop this guy before he shoots somebody else.
Eddie, you're the target. You're not going anywhere.
you're staying covered right here, okay.
you can act as spotter from the ground.
boss... - That's an order.
team, report in.
leaving City Hall.
there's an employee entrance.
let's do this fast before he shoots again.
we kept the freight elevator open for you guys.
Stairwell's been blocked off. No one's been up or down?
not since we locked it up. One SRU officer, that's it.
one SRU officer? Alone?
Yeah. From Team 3.
Thanks. - Hey, Ed, Team 3 on the scene?
negative. Team 4. Why?
copper said an SRU went up to the roof. Solo.
he said he was Team 3.
Yeah, I know.
spike, put out an APB.
subject may be wearing an SRU uniform or a mockup identifying himself as Team 3.
we got reports that SRU entered building southwest corner, Bay and Queen.
we're accounted for. Team 4's accounted for.
is there anything else you can tell us, Luka?
anything at all?
he's not a bad person.
he's not. He got a job.
he tried to fit in, but when his father was killed right in front of him...
I wanted to help him.
the lawsui - it was useless, expensive.
it just made it worse.
he got more angry, more bitter.
it was... It was terrible to watch.
ed, we're at the roof. We're ready to move in.
northwest corner by the air vent. Looks like a rifle barrel.
copy.
guys, they're going in. Boss?
Yeah, I'm on my way.
almost there.
Thanks.
he's not moving.
low and slow. - Copy.
he shot himself. Any signs of trauma?
it's hard to tell. - I think we got him.
police, drop your weapon! Hands in the air or we will shoot!
show me your hands! Show me your hands! Show me your hands!
it's a decoy! - Where is he?
it's a decoy. Fall back. Fall back now! Take cover!
officer down! Officer down! Medic, come now. Jules has been hit!
officer down. We need EMS. Bay and Queen. SRU officer down.
stay with me, Jules.
stay with me.
stay with me. Stay with me.
we're under fire! Get up here now!
somebody get an angle on this guy!
shots are coming from City Hall.
boss, this is about me.
I come out, draw his fire, you get her out of the way.
negative. Negative. We do it as a team.
copy, Greg. Get her out of there.
spike, you and me, West Tower, City Hall.
low and tight. Louis, you cover. - Yup.
roof's a grate. We'll get eyes on the mechanical room.
keep her sealed off.
stay tight. Stay tight.
you're gonna be okay. We're getting you out.
keep her stiff. - We're getting you out, Jules.
go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
easy! Easy!
hang on. We got you.
come on. Come on.
she's clear!
we've got him. Upper left.
go.
Hey, got to let her go.
team 4 Sierra's countering from the East Tower.
Sam, let's find a Sierra shot.
I got it.
ed, we're on our way.
boss, I found a vantage point.
I can see the mechanical roof.
for the first five minutes of every day, I forget that he's gone.
then I remember, and I see him die. - Okay.
he's got Ed. He's got a gun to his head.
we're on our way, Spike.
I don't have a clear shot.
Ed's in my line of fire.
come on. Come on!
you know what it's like to do what you got to do to save your family, okay?
I'm just... I just...
my family's dead.
okay, take a breath. - You killed my father.
Petar. Petar. - He was all I had.
let's just slow it down here, buddy, okay?
I need you to... - Tomorrow morning, for the first five minutes...
your son will forget that you're gone.
I need you to listen to me now, buddy, all right?
Sam, we need a solution.
I can't get a clear shot. He's behind the pillar.
ed, you got to move forward.
I need you to listen to me.
I'm sorry, but I need you to listen to me. Please don't shoot.
subject's down.
not a good day for either of us.
Yes, sir.
just give him a minute, will you?
where is she?
saint Simon's. We're on our way.
I want to go with you. - Sam.
boss, the paperwork can't wait. - Sam.
get there when you can, okay? We'll be there. We're not going anywhere.
it's a good job.
what? Please? Please? He was my friend.
he's cleared. - He was my friend.
next of kin.
what should I have said to him?
what should I have said? - What?
you did the best you could do.
know that. You hear me?
you know that.
that's all you can do. Go on.
Hey, Jules. Hey, sweetheart, how you doing?
I got here as fast as I could, Jules.
I'm so sorry.
I should have protected you.
okay, time to go, buddy.
no way.
there's nothing for you to do here.
if there was, wouldn't let you leave. Go on.
she's on my team...
Eddie, you're two hours away, anything hapns, anything changes.
you need to be with your family.
do you hear me?
those aren't just words.
go on. All right?
Hey, it'll be okay.
Hey, kid do.
how's she doing?
she's stabilized.
she's in good hands. She'll be okay.
and how are you doing?
I'm exhausted. - Yeah.
want to talk about it?
when we get there, okay? - Okay. I'll drive.
Hey, kid do.
can I sit in the front, Dad?
all right. Jump in. Jump in.
looks like we gotta figure this one out, huh?
I was under the impression all the figuring had been done, Greg.
I've got the slugs, Spike. we're on our way.
ed, the range is short and that thing doesn't shoot straight.
you don't hit him dead on, it could be bad for sam.
spike, we've got no choice.
why should he live? Why should he live? When, every day, what he did kills all of us, Greg.
it kills all of us a little bit more till there's...there's nothing left.
there is something left, Walter.
what? There's no reason why. There's just people in pain spinning around a black hole, hoping that somebody, anybody...
go, now!
could put chili peppers in her smoothie?
4 hours earlier
no. No, shaving cream in her locker. Put shaving cream in her locker.
that is a great idea. What are we, in summer camp? We're gonna short sheet her bed next?
come on, she's 10 years vet. She's been hazed by the best.
we gotta come up with something good. Something real good.
Sam, any ideas?
do we really need to haze her? I mean, she's not gonna be here forever, right?
no, but we wanna make her feel like she's part of the team, right?
we don't know when Jules is gonna be back.
guys, after the escort today, we take all the kevlar out of her vest, we fill it with cream cheese then we do the obstacle course. First time she falls flat on her face, instant hilarity.
you know what? You're a genius.
all right, Wordy, get a camera for that.
what are you? Mr. Mature all of a sudden?
come on, who's the guy that put the pepper spray in Spike's gear his first day, huh?
it's like you said, "We're not dealing with some rookie here."
she deserves a chance to settle in, make a good impression.
then you get the boots with the cream cheese...
Hi, boys.
morning.
Hey, Wordy, that escort job we have to today, I could use the shield...refresher that we talked about.
okay.
sure. 5 minutes?
awesome.
take your time.
see you out there.
all right. Gentlemen.
what?
it's just that sometimes you don't... really know what it is that's gonna set it off.
it could be a...a song.
or, uh...something that she used to say.
but this time it wasn't uh...anything like that.
it was...more about the loneliness.
anyway it happened and now I move on.
my name is Wendy and I miss my little girl.
but it has been 8 days since my last drink and I'm just very happy to be here right now.
I'd say you got our attention.
well, I was just trying to... throw you guys off a little bit.
spare myself the whip cream in the boot trick for a day or two.
Yeah, well, you know the drill.
are you kidding? Back in vice, I wrote the drill.
so, you were in vicefor how long?
four years. Two in undercover.
apparently, I make a very convincing meth freak.
Really?
which I try not to take too personally.
Yeah, blending in with those guys... I don't thinki could do it.
Yeah. You know what the worst part is?
you kinda get used to it.
Oh, yeah?
I saw the opening here, I thought...
I wanna be a straight up good guy, you know? sounds pretty damn nice to me.
uh, you know what? It's great.
okay, thanks, Spike.
all right, we're gonna go over the brief one more time, catch Donna up to speed.
it's good to see you. - It's good to see you too.
I thought I might find you here.
sorry about the wait.
my lawyer's been all over it. You just need to sign and, uh...
well, I always thought your maiden name was prettier anyhow.
uh, listen.
nobody's supposed to know about this, but...
they're flying him in today.
who?
what do you mean, "who"?
the leslie spit killer is our escort job?
Peter Wilkins, yup.
17 women in 6 years.
eleven months ago, homicide's about to press charges and he bolts overseas.
a month ago, he turns up in a mental hospital in bernberg, germany.
he admits to everything: names, dates, dumping patterns.
weren't they holding him, saying he was too crazy to be tried?
Yeah, but the legal wrangling is over.
we say that he gets a mental competency hearing and they fly him over to us.
and we're the welcoming party.
this is a joint op. Us and the federal customs department.
all right, our counterpart is...Delia Semple With the airport attachment.
airport might be in our city, guys, but, on the other side of customs, that's international territory.
it's her jurisdiction, it's her rules.
when did you get back from assignment?
I mean, your parents have been calling. They said that they haven't heard from you...
got nothing to say to them.
Oh, Walter, come on, you can't still...
Oh, so you're passed that too, eh?
learn how to do that in one of your little groups?
Yeah. You should try one sometime It helps.
Yeah, it didn't help so much last week.
what happened then? You forget her?
you know, not all of us get to go off and be a war hero.
some of us have to stay right here, in the same house, and go by the same school that she went to everyday!
some of us don't get to forget, ever!
all right, I'm sorry.
I know I wasn't there when you needed me.
there's enough "sorrys" to go around.
Walter, it's taken me a lot of years and a lot of bottles to get here, but you can do this too, and you're not losing her by doing it.
you're moving forward for her.
every time I close my eyes, I see her, Wendy.
I see her lying on that thing they slid her out on,
and I hear myself saying, "yeah, that's her, that's my daughter.
every time I close my eyes.
and that's where you still are, but i can't be there anymore.
and when you find that you can't be either, I want you to phone me. Any time.
even after this, okay?
all right, we're gonna meet at the gate, the feds are gonna escort the prisoner to customs.
then we are gonna take custody, escort the prisoner to the psychiatric evaluation.
now, nobody knows he's flying in today, so there's no crowd control.
but if anybody wants this guy? They will go through us to get him, all right?
so, let's keep our eyes open.
let's gear up, hit the trucks.
I have lived with, sold to, bought from scumbags, but protecting them? Come on.
you got words of wisdom for that?
listen, as for me, I get confused,
I just think of my daughters. and whatever I gotta do, I do.
a few guys just through the customs doors over there.
so, straight across and out here to the trucks.
like I said, low profile all the way.
is it true that accused serial killer Peter Wilkins is being taken into custody today?
and what do you have to say to the victims families?
madam, please, just stand back.
Eddie, low profile.
Hey, I followed every protocol you sent, this isn't on us.
right this way, guys.
I know how some of you must be feeling right now, and I'm sorry.
but right now we have a job to do, so, if you just vacate the premises, everyone'll be a lot safer.
thank you very much.
just a second.
I just don't see the big deal?
Mr. Broder, by the time we get Mr. Wilkins into custody, till the time we get him to that hospital, he's as exposed as he'll ever be.
just 5 minutes tops.
5 minutes is a long time to be walking through that crowd of people;
we have no legal ground to restrain who'd want to kill this guy.
and that's bad why again?
listen, Mr. Broder, all kidding aside, my main concern is for my team and the job they have to do，and Agent Delia Semple, federal customs department airport attachment.
who's Sergeant Parker?
right here. How are you?
sergeant Parker, I understand you have a problem, which means I have a problem.
no argument there.
good start. Solutions?
we were just discussing those with Mr. Broder here.
no matter where I move the crowd to, you still gotta go past them.
he's not wrong. once you're through customs, there's only one way to go.
but not through that crowd.
we could take the prisoner directly from the airplane;
we have a truck on the tarmac.
out of the question.
look, we understand: tarmac's international grounds, federal jurisdiction.
you need to hand him off on our turf, we get it.
boss, why don't we take him through customs, and then double back to a loading area, and have a truck waiting there?
our turf, take custody there, but we gotta keep the crowd preoccupied, or they'll follow the truck.
well, I can give them a little press conference, a little distraction, while you guys are getting elvis outta the building.
so, you wanna take the prisoner along a non-vetted route, through an international area where he's back under my jurisdiction, lie to the press and evade the public?
pretty much. - Pretty much.
let's make it work.
this is Agent Semple. Superintendent MaCean, please.
then get him out of the meeting, how about?
thank you.
superintendent, slight change of plan. Absolutely necessary, I'm afraid.
not a bad vacation for the guys who get to fly over, at least.
well, if you like jumping over the ocean in a metal coffin, sure.
so there's something that you guys are actually afraid of?
well. You know what? We all have our weak spots. could be anything: flying, cats...
it was one cat; it was mean. - I was there, it was mean.
Oh, well, I'm with you.
try flying into Khartoum International, everything feels like a cakewalk after that.
Khartoum? Youthful backpacking?
it was year ago, went through a rough time, needed to get away.
helped train local police there. It was a good experience.
copy. They're coming off.
okay, subject's approaching. Everybody up.
Peter Wilkins, I hereby take custody of you and will transport you through customs, after which time you will be placed in the custody of the strategic response unit and transferred to ossington mental hospital.
let's get this over with.
hey Sarge, Roscoe's trying to get you...
not now, Danny, I'm busy.
well, he wants you to go up to departures...
cover for me. I'll get your back later.
sorry, bro, cannot, they want me down here.
Hey, what's up with the crowd, anyway? Somebody famous coming in or something?
well. I'm down here, so I'll deal with it.
Yeah, but they want...
I am exactly where I need to be right now.
I'm gonna tell Roscoe.
tell whoever you want. To stay outta my way.
or you're gonna do what, big man?!
all set, Sergeant.
all right, I'll wait for your confirmation.
Lewis, accompany the Sarge.
Eddie, It's not necessary, I'm just making a statement.
we know the new route; those people out there don't, and if one of 'em is planning on taking a run at our guy, that puts you in their way.
look, hey...Sorry about that cat thing.
we'll talk about that later.
diamond formation.
can I have your attention please?
everyone please listen it up.
I'm telling you, Volcek is 10 pounds of crazy in a 5 pound bag, okay?
he grabbed me.
his eyes, Broder, I'm telling you, I get chills thinking about those eyes, okay?
Danny, are you high? Cause I don't have time.
just to let you know, we'll be making an announcement in a few minutes.
I beg your patience.
you see the crap I'm dealing with right now? You think I have time for your crap?
there he is.
okay, let's find out.
coming through the last session. All clear.
copy that.
something's going on with broder.
excuse me. Excuse me,
Oh, Danny, get back to work.
I'm hit!
team, status. status.
we just took fire.
who's hit?! Check the prisoner! Who's hit!
wordy! Wordy's down.
I'm good, I'm good, it's in the vest.
Where's the shooter?
no eyes! No eyes on the shooter.
prisoner's unharmed!
the vest! - Are you sure?
deep breath, wordy. - Let's go.
wordy okay?
someone help me up. Help me up.
agent Semple, stop!
agent Semple is pursuing the shooter!
Sam and I gotta go!
negative. You stay with the prisoner, Ed.
she's got no backup!
Sam, go! Get her, bring her back!
we're gonna take the prisoner to customs.
okay, let's do that.
1, 2, 3, let's go! Go, go, go!
Proaching mechanical room. Level 3.
now... this stops now. - That's up to you.
suspect is cornered, need backup immediately.
it's over.
agent Semple, take cover behind me.
Go-go-go!
Eddie! Eddie, backup, now.
copy that. We're on our way.
negative, negative! Stand down. Stand down nice phone. GPS?
shooter on the loose...the whole area's unsecure.
we protect the prisoner here until we apprehend the shooter and get sam back.
copy.
agent Semple, I'm gonna send my guys to the mechanical room.
as soon as we get the prisoner...
no point, they're gone.
Oh, god, I'm so sorry, Parker.
you need to get yourself checked out after that blast.
I'm getting intel, I'll be there in 5.
let's get this vest off.
Thanks, I'm fine. Just gimme one sec, okay?
sir, we need a room with one entrance and no windows.
you got something?
what about the holding areas for suspicious entrants?
got that?
that's our communication, we can all hear each other with that.
this is Gregory Parker with the Police Stratigic Response Unit.
is there someone else on this line?
can you tell me your name, sir?
no
listen very carefully.
we are going to do a prisoner swap in 20 minutes. I'll contact you with a location.
okay, can you tell me if my officer's all right?
he's fine.
for now.
all right, no communication except by phone.
everybody got that? - Copy.
we need a different location for holding, something secure.
Wordy, you still need medical assistance.
I'm fine, we need to get Sam. - Let's go.
I hear you, I hear you, but with the rounds you took, you're not running after anything.
I'm not sitting this one out.
so I'm gonna put you on protection. We can't move that prisoner until we've neutralized the shooter and secured the area.
we need you, Wordy, we just need you where we can use you.
whatever I have to do. - Partner with Wordy.
Yeah, yeah, Spike, Lewis, you're with me.
room by room if we have to. Let's see some floor plans.
Hey. - Hey.
Walter Volcek--joined custodial a month ago.
father of Julie Volcek, 14th victim of Peter Wilkins.
my superiors have been informed. We're checking every security camera, every...
okay, thank you. We'll take care of it from here.
I put the word out to all our agents on-site.
our #1 priority is getting your man back.
Parker, he is where he is because of what I let happen - No.
no, you didn't let anything happen. This guy's a pro.
I'm gonna guess he's military.
how's that?
he's a great shot and he grabbed one of my guys, and that's a hard thing to do.
now, what I'm worried about is his lack of care for getting caught or killed.
that tells me he's desperate, which means he's dangerous.
well, don't think you can afford to turn down any help, can you?
okay, well, we can, uh, use some help interviewing staff and protesters and the ever-so-vigilant Security Chief Broder.
let's go.
over here.
sit down where I can see you-- right here.
don't move.
you okay?
shut it!
is it bad? - Uh... no. It, uh...
a rib or... maybe three.
in what universe is it fair that we protect that and you take a bullet for it?
if you got an answer, I'd love to hear it.
my wife, Shelley, is going to ask me that in about three hours.
so, you think of your daughters now.
what do you want to do to him?
I guess, uh...
I think, when I go home tonight and I hold my baby girl, it's got to be with clean hands.
okay, sit, sit. Right here-- sit down.
never seen it so empty before. - That's procedure.
we cleared the whole area for you.
how are the ribs? - My hearing's a little shot.
was just a concussive grenade.
with your, uh... your body armor, there shouldn't be any real damage.
I appreciate the planning that must have gone into that.
you obviously don't want to hurt anyone except...
well, the plan has changed.
can't afford to be so considerate anymore.
infantry?
air Force?
come on, not Navy, please.
you?
special Forces. - That figures.
jumps on a grenade.
tell all the ladies what a superhero you are.
Yeah, infantry-- spend all your time bitching about Special Forces.
and no flags come up when his name matches one of Wilkins' victims?
how is that supposed to come up in a clearance check?
Oh, I don't know. It took Semple's guys 30 seconds on Google.
Yeah.
Yeah, so I'm the bad guy.
meanwhile, these poor people...
you won't even let them get a look at the scumbag who's off to get, what, ten years of Ping-Pong?
they don't deserve that justice, at least?
who's the bad guy again? Huh?
a member of the victim's group said they got an anonymous call this morning.
a male voice said,"If you want to see justice, come to the airport today.
figure Volcek made the call?
maybe... but then, how did he find out about the flight in the first place?
how did he get his gun through employee security?
and who knew about the alternate route?
us, you guys...
and Mr. Security there.
let me have a talk with our Mr. Broder.
so, prisoner exchange... really?
saw it work in the Sudan.
you in SAFARI?
Yeah, it was part of UNMIS.
the Sudanese army, they had a...bunch of rebels. They turned them over to us.
rebels handed over some of their soldiers.
it all seemed pretty straightforward.
this isn't Africa.
you got that right.
if this was Africa, nobody would have a problem with what I have to do.
you lose somebody you love, I'm not saying I don't get you.
get me? Buddy, don't even try to pretend, all right?
what I'm saying is, from an operational standpoint,
I'm not seeing the desired outcome being very likely, knowing our rules of engagement.
sudanese had rules, too.
but when the wives and the children of your soldiers are crying at your door every night, the rules change.
people can do things they never would have expected.
I don't understand how Walter could have done something like this.
I tried to help him.
we... we tried to go to groups together, and he...
he just... he couldn't do it. He just couldn't get past it.
there anything else you can tell me?
anything that might reach him?
it's just, you... you feel so alone.
you feel like you're the...you're the only person that's going through this, and if he knew... if he knew that he wasn't alone...
thank you, Wendy. We'll let him know that.
ed, just spoke with Volcek's wife. You copy?
copy that, boss. What did she say?
he's a good guy. He's a loyal soldier.
they had one daughter, Julie. She was 15 when Wilkins killed her.
there are some complicating factors, though.
Volcek was on assignment when it happened.
Julie was with her grandparents, his folks.
they let her stay out past curfew.
she never came home.
Walter hasn't spoken to them since then.
marriage... well, you know... you know the stats on that one.
parents of a murder victim.
I mean, it's all pretty understandable, you know?
textbook loser, eh?
I'm not saying that, Walter. - Why not?
I've lived with it long enough.
almost done, though.
you know what I want.
and give it to me...
you can have me.
shoot me-- I don't care anymore.
okay, but I care. I care about my guy.
and I do care about what you're going through.
but I especially care about ending this without any more pain.
so, please, can you help me do that?
sure.
come and meet me.
gate 525.
I'll have your guy; you have mine.
okay, but that's going to take some time, Walter.
five minutes.
let's get this over with.
okay... Spike and Lewis?
securing level 2. I'm going to meet them at Gate 526.
okay, you're Sierra 1. - Copy that.
broder gave himself up.
says he called in the tip to the group.
thinks he was being a righteous citizen.
he swears up and down he had nothing to do with Walter.
just a bad coincidence. - Yeah, uh-huh.
we're keeping on him. Nice bit of talk there.
sounds like you had him in the end. - Yeah, well, we'll see how much when we show up with no Wilkins.
I got eyes on both of them. We're sticking to hand signals for now.
copy. If he shows up, I'll be there in five.
until then, if he makes any kind of move on Sam...
copy that, boss.
okay. Okay... okay.
boss, he's here. - Okay, I'm on my way.
you've got Scorpio if you need it.
I'll bring my hand up very slowly, cause I'm sure you've got a sniper on me, and I want him...I want him to see this.
what the hell is that?
boss, we've got a big problem.
what, you can't take the shot? - No, I can take the shot.
but if I do, I'll kill Sam.
he's holding a frag grenade. The pin has been pulled.
if I take him out, he'll take out Sam and anybody within 20 feet.
if I don't see Wilkins in five minutes, I let go. That's it.
unless somebody's got a better idea.
unless somebody has a better idea. Is he talking to us?
ed, we need Spike to scan for any nearby radio receivers.
I think Volcek might be trying to reach out to someone.
I can't.
spike's covering him and Sam. If Wordy and Donna can switch with Lewis and Spike...
no, they've got Wilkins.
I'm going to call for a backup team.
to get here in five minutes? - Ed...
sergeant, let me help.
Delia... Least I can do is help you do your job.
you get your officers off Wilkins, I'll cover him.
no, no, he's our responsibility, once you handed him off officially.
look, we both know who's wearing this when it's over, and I'm ready to face that, so let me cover for you.
you go, I watch him-- off the books. Come back, it never happened.
let me do this for you.
and me.
thank you.
ed, Semple's going to help.
get your guy. Bring him back safe.
she'll send Wordy and Donna your way.
copy that.
Hi, Walter.
I'm Greg Parker.
guess we got to figure this one out, huh?
I was under the impression all the figuring had been done, Greg.
Yeah, I'm going to have to be honest with you.
I'm not going to be able to give you what you want.
spike, I need you to scan for any kind of radio frequency.
boss has got a hunch.
what about Sam? This guy's escalating. Maybe try for a hand-to-hand takedown.
it's too risky. He drops it, I'll lose you both. No way.
no sniper, no distraction, no hand-to-hand.
what do we have left? - I'll get the slug.
it's a long shot, I know, but it's all we've got.
you want to tell me what this is all about, then?
I just, uh...
to be honest, Greg...
I just need some time here.
okay. You want time? You want to explain that to me?
I can't explain it to you, Greg, cause you don't know.
nobody knows. People who say they do know... they're the worst.
all these people, they say they want to help you, they just don't leave you alone, you know?
but you got to be alone to understand why.
right?
I've got the slug. Spike, we're on our way.
you've got to be really careful, okay?
it'll do the job, it will paralyze on contact, but Ed, the range is short, and that thing doesn't shoot straight.
you don't hit him dead-on, it could be. . it could be bad for Sam.
spike, we've got no choice.
why should he live, when every day, what he...
what he did...
kills all of us?
it kills all of us, Greg, a little bit more and a little bit more and a little bit more until there's nothing left.
there is something left, Walter.
what?
what's left, Greg?
what's always been there.
family. Your family...
who still needs you, no matter what.
family.
let me tell you a little bit about my family, Greg.
I have a...
an ex-wife who drank herself into a coma every night for four years, and she pities me.
I have a mother and a father that I can't even look at without thinking about throwing up.
and I have a CD where a daughter used to be. There's no family left, Greg!
see, that's what you realize.
there's no reason why.
there's just people in pain, spinning around a black hole, hoping that somebody, anybody...
...will just finish this! - Go now!
go, go, go!
stay down! Stay down! Don't move!
No! - Don't move. Lay down on the ground.
No! No! No!
get him up.
we know who's working with you, Walter.
come on. It was Broder, right?
Yeah.
he put the call into-into the victim's group for a distraction?
the alternate route-- he tipped you off?
what's this better idea you're talking about? What's he supposed to do?
come on, buddy. He's already in custody.
whatever it is, it's not gonna happen.
and the more cooperative you are, the better it will be for you.
this isn't the Sudan, Walter.
we can't change the rules. We got a job to do, no matter what.
what about the Sudan?
he was stationed there last year.
Why?
Wordy, Donna, get back to the prisoner right away.
what's up, boss? - Stupid.
superintendent McLean's office?
Yeah. Did Agent Semple call today about a change in the escort route for, uh, Peter Wilkins?
thank you.
okay, Ed, uh, they didn't get a call.
they didn't get a call. She wasn't talking to them.
so, what's that got to do with Broder? - Yeah, I think Broder was telling the truth.
he didn't have anything to do with this. It was Walter and Delia.
run.
I need to make it look like you tried to escape.
I said run, you son of a bitch.
run!
clear.
they're not here, boss.
listen to me, Walter.
I know you think you're trying to protect her, but you're not.
if Agent Semple hurts that man, she's done, she's destroyed.
have you not been listening, Greg?
she's already done.
run!
Logan got her sister the same time he got my Julie.
she could have lost it, like most of us, but she was... she was strong.
she didn't even tell her superiors.
her sister had a married name, so she just kept it to herself.
she tell you this in Khartoum, the Sudan?
Yeah.
it was like it happened for a reason. I mean, what are the chances?
both of us being there, both of us trying to get away from the same thing, but you...
you can't get away. You can't get away. And it's like you can...
it's like you can smell it on each other. You know?
stinks like, uh...
like gasoline.
that kind of pain.
what's she going to do, Walter?
all I had to do was shoot him.
now that's all she has to do.
boss, we're looking at the CCTV now.
wait a minute. Wait a minute.
if she used her ID card, there's a record of it.
right here. I got her.
third basement, right below us.
the two of you get down there. I'm on my way.
copy. There's a door right around the corner.
no. No, please.
close your eyes, and this will be over.
please.
close your eyes! - Please.
agent Semple?
I just want him to close his eyes.
you need to put the gun down.
I just need him to close his eyes.
I said, close your eyes! - Oh, please.
no. - Donna, on target.
if you don't put the gun down, we'll be forced to shoot you.
do you understand?
Delia, what are you doing?
this isn't right. This isn't justice. This is vengeance. You know that.
you don't know what I know.
okay. But can I tell you what I do know?
you've had Wilkins all alone for nearly 20 minutes.
you could have killed him by now, but you didn't.
because you're a cop. You're not a killer.
I was a good cop.
I was a good sister.
and you still can be.
no. He took that away.
now I'm just this. - Delia, no! No! No...!
get him down! Get him down! Get him down!
after which point, Mr. Wilkins was returned to our custody.
and the body of Agent Delia Semple was transported to Metro General awaiting an autopsy.
Donna, do you have anything to add?
how did SIU go?
I shot a cop. They're really happy.
Donna, we have a saying here.
just cause you did right, doesn't mean you get to feel right.
our hands are clean, yeah?
okay.
team 1, hot call at the Michelangelo Foodsat Brimley and Matheson.
armed robbery, multiple hostages.
there's some misunderstanding.
he's only 17.
you have got to get him out of there.
Wordy, how you doing? - I'm heading to the drops. Steer me in.
with haste, gentlemen, with haste.
where do I start?
he's had the year from hell.
get out of my face. - It's over.
sierra 1 in position.
hold fire till my command.
I thought I could trust you. - Put the gun down.
standing by for explosive entry. - Copy that.
think I won't do it? - I know you won't do it.
sierra 1... - I've got the solution.
Donnie, give it to me. It's over! - No!
Scorpio.
so that's it? That's the plan: Lethbridge?
5 hours eailier
Jack said he can get me a job.
what about the restaurant?
your dream, our dream.
it'll pick up again, David.
by $30, 000?
just give it time.
see this letter, Liz?
do you see where it says "Notice of eviction"?
don't talk to me like I'm a child.
well, stop acting like one.
face facts!
the restaurant's a failure.
so... whose fault is that?
don't you dare lay this at my feet.
well, I'm not the one dragging our family halfway across the country.
Hey, Jules.
Hey.
what are you doing here? - That's a nice way to say hi.
I'm sorry. I didn't expect to see you.
glad you came by.
actually, I came to talk to the boss.
which... I should go.
Hey, Jules, what's wrong?
nothing's wrong.
you've been avoiding me all week.
I have not been avoiding you all week.
Yeah, you have, Jules.
Sam, okay, I'm not going to do this here.
do what?
Hey, do what?
when I return to the SRU... - Jules, we talked about this.
we did? Me bringing it up and you changing the subject.
that's not talking about it, Sam.
well, what's the point?
the point is, when I return to the SRU, we have to talk about what happens then, okay?
now you're on shift, so let's talk tonight.
okay, I'll meet you at your place.
okay. We'll get a coffee or something.
okay, coffee.
I can't stand being in this house anymore, man.
I got to get out.
want to catch a movie?
Nah, I'm not into it.
go to the mall. Sit outside Bikini Cabin.
come on, Donnie. What are you, like 12?
man, like you weren't into it when Tessa Price was there with the new belly button piercing?
Oh, my God.
meet me at the shop in ten. - All right.
Hey, bud, Mom is out, so I thought that we'd have a talk.
about moving 3, 400 clicks away?
I checked.
I'm sorry you found out the way that you did.
well, what about school?
and my friends?
aren't we just talking about Donnie?
why are you always ragging on him?
because it seems like your whole world revolves around this kid.
I-I... I really don't think it's healthy.
how about you just try expanding your horizons a little bit?
Hey, where are you going?
my horizons need expanding.
so had to think fast, right?
like one of those times when you got to do what you got to do, right?
so the subject comes running up screaming.
I kick the door down, right?
spike didn't kick the door in.
I did.
and the subject wasn't screaming.
guys, you mind? I'm telling a story here, okay?
so the subject comes out with this blade, Donna.
and it's like this big.
wow, a sword.
okay, okay, maybe more like that.
a machete. - Yeah, sure, it was a machete.
Donna... it was this big.
wh are you talking about this big?
I'm just saying it was... - What is that supposed to be?
that's not even a letter opener.
it doesn't matter about the size, Spike.
what are you doing that? You know you shouldn't do that to a guy ever.
Sam, you're late for workout.
sorry, sir.
no. - What do you mean no?
I mean, no, you can't go.
like I have a choice?
look, my parents are broke or something.
they're behind on rent.
they're kicking us out.
then all we've got to do is find the money.
Yeah, and how are we going to do that?
I don't know.
my dad's got some old vinyl.
maybe we could sell it online or something.
Donnie, it's like 30 grand.
there's no way.
dude, you can't go.
you're the only non-jerk I know.
please, I'm already pissed off.
don't make it worse.
you should be.
we grew up here.
this is our store. That's our mall.
this is our life.
they're going to throw it all away?
let's go. I need to chill.
how you doing?
I asked you a question, Sam. How you doing?
fine. I'm fine.
you look like crap. - Thanks.
but you're fine? - That's what I said.
that's what you said.
Oh, you're mirroring me, Ed?
cause I'm your teammate, not your subject.
I know that, but if something's wrong, it's going to affect your performance; I need to know.
I'm fine. Really.
hold up.
bro, what are you doing?
why are we stopping here?
I want some cookies.
you serious? They have them at the convenience store.
Yeah, well, I like the ones they have here.
do you know how much they charge? They're like ten bucks.
Yeah, dude, I know.
I used to work here. That's how I got hooked on 'em.
why'd they fire you anyway?
cause they're jerks.
I was totally awesome at that job, man, totally dedicated.
the cookies are that way.
no, no, they're up there now.
what?
I got so much work in the office.
I'm never going home.
that the guy that fired you?
no. He's Ashton, the night manager.
you know, after my dedicated service to this establishment,
I think I deserve a parting gift.
can you not do this right now?
Nylons?
for my mom.
Donnie... Let's hit the head.
there's one in the back-- employees only.
just drop the stuff so we can go.
bathroom first. Come on.
What?!
we're not supposed to be here.
Oh, easy, Grandma.
it's almost closing time.
no one's gonna be back here.
in five minutes, the head teller's gonna give the deposit bags to Ashton.
no.
no, I do not want to hear this.
just listen.
Ashton's going to bring the deposit bags down to the safe to be picked up later tonight by security.
what are you saying?
I'm saying we stop him.
jump out, grab the money.
we run out that service door. It's easy.
your dad needs money, right?
for rent?
dude, come on!
look, man.
we're brothers, okay?
and brothers are always there for each other.
five minutes and everything gets taken care of.
five minutes and you get everything you need.
some dude did the exact same thing a year ago.
he made off with like 70K.
okay, whatever.
it's still wrong.
the store's insured. They don't care.
d, stop.
stop and think a second.
I have.
and you can either step up and help, or you can turn your back and let me go out there alone.
dude, you know I'm not going to let you do that by yourself.
so you're with me?
you're with me.
give me the money!
come on! Come on!
lose the stocking. Lose the stocking!
drop the bag. Drop it. Drop it!
come on! Come on!
help me!
get him off!
what the... what the hell?!
what the hell did you do?!
you wanted me to help you.
go. We're headed out the front door.
we're just two customers walking out the front door.
nearly there.
like I said, there was two of them.
a big guy in a black jacket.
the other guy had a red coat.
they were armed... That's them.
we're done, man.
it's over.
it ain't over, bro.
not even close.
team 1, hot call at the Michelangelo Foods at Brimley and Matheson.
armed robbery, multiple htages.
Sam and Donna, recon the building, all ways in and out.
copy that.
okay, here's what we know.
old-school stickup, two masked guys come in before closing, hold up the manager with a knife.
and moved away from the window. No shot.
spike, let's make sure everyone's healthy in there.
I can get into the security system, patch it into the truck.
eyes in ten minutes. - You got five.
lew, you're my second. - Copy that.
Sarge, subjects bumped into armed security as they fled.
one of the guards chased 'em back inside.
after that, we don't know what happened to them.
okay, well, let's hope they didn't get their hands on his gun.
see if we can ID him, Wordy.
copy.
eddy, tac options?
we got high exposed ceilings, lots of vantage.
I say we stealth in, set up a sniper perch, watch and wait.
all right, well, you know what you need to do.
copy that.
look... this is really making me nervous.
will you put it away?
kinda using it right now.
dude, robbery is one thing, but now there's a gun, okay?
there are hostages. - I know.
it's cool, huh?
cool?
he used to work here.
no, I didn't.
Yeah, you did.
you're the guy they caught napping in the storeroom.
what's your name again? Richie? - No, it wasn't me.
Yeah, whatever.
don't "whatever" me. - Yeah, man, whatever.
I'm not scared of you.
you're not gonna use that gun.
he's not gonna use the gun.
I'd prefer to give him the benefit of the doubt.
this is Sergeant Gregory Parker with the Police Strategic Response Unit.
I will be calling the store phone, so please pick it up so we can talk this over.
okay, dude, when he calls, we'll say we're sorry.
let's forget about it and go home.
he sounded nice.
maybe, maybe he could help.
maybe, maybe he'll lessen the charges.
it's not like we did anything that bad.
cept for armed robbery.
not like that's a felony.
is this what it's gonna take for you to shut up?
okay. - What happened there, tough guy?
what happened? Something scare you?
not so chatty now, are you? - D, stop!
dude, this is messed up.
let's just walk away.
Oh, yeah, yeah, walk right into jail.
and you know what happens in jail, don't you?
to guys like you and me, hmm?
think about it.
tape their wrists.
is there anything you can give that'll help ID these guys?
height, weight, tattoos, scars, anything?
Oh, man, it was all a big blur.
one was black; one was white.
one of 'em was wearing one of those glow-in-the-dark ankle bands.
like cyclists wear? - Yeah.
9: 48 p. m. SRU on scene.
armed robbery, Michelangelo's.
establishing command post.
spike, eyes.
moments away, boss. Moments away.
that's the cops.
take over.
Hey, this is Sergeant Greg Parker.
who am I speaking to?
this is... this is D-Roc.
D-Roc, is that a nickname, last name?
I had a buddy back home.
we used to call him "D." His name was Daryl.
your name Daryl?
look, I know how you guys operate, okay?
don't try to be my buddy.
don't play me.
I'm not here to play games, D-Roc.
I'm here to help you.
that went well.
spike, eyes?
let there be light.
got a customer in scrubs. Maybe a nurse?
those two look like employees. Possibly a manager.
that's D-Roc. Subject one. - Yeah?
Hey, D-Roc, I need to know who else is in there with you.
can you tell me?
we got three hostages.
not including the security guard?
Yeah. Not including him.
and he's unharmed? - He's fine.
he's not hurt?
I told you he's fine. He's in the back.
don't worry about him.
okay, D-Roc, your partner.
mind if I ask what his name is?
backslash.
all right, I told you what you wanted to know.
now it's my turn.
let's talk demands. - All right.
we need to get out of here. - Okay. Where?
where we wanna go? - Home.
come on. Gimme something!
tell you where we're going later.
right now, you just get us something to take us there.
okay, where?
he doesn't know what he wants.
he's covering insecurity with arrogance right now.
he's scared. - But determined.
not a happy combo.
those aliases come up in the database?
D-Roc and Backslash come back clean.
maybe it's a gang initiation.
Nah, Backslash, that's not street. That's a computer thing.
okay, could be a handle.
guys, Facebook, MySpace, online forums.
copy.
I got a couple of bikes here.
Wordy, check the undersides for serial numbers.
uh, there's nothing on the first one.
wait, I got one.
okay, Wiiesubject's bike has a serial number: 487623.
accessing Metro Police database.
got it. Adam Jackson.
32 Fern Crescent, Markham.
age? - He's 17.
wonderful Winnie.
have uniforms dispatch to that address immediately.
you got it.
this is Winnie Camden with the SRU.
I need uniforms at 3230 Fern Crescent ASAP.
kids. - Perfect.
guys, no one wants a kid in their crosshairs. - Copy that.
guys, I got a way in.
the subjects are barricaded in here which gives them good sightlines on the front and side entrances.
so we come in from the rear? - Yeah.
we check out the loading dock.
if we can't go through, there's a trapdoor in the storage room that will get us to the machine room.
so we shimmy up, pry open the trapdoor to the machine room.
then we're on the roof.
exactly. - Nice.
there's a skylight right here, which give us good vantage.
cut a hole, set up a perch.
I line up the Sierra shot.
no, I got it.
is there any reason why you don't want me to take it?
do I need one? It's my team, my call.
Donna, contain the front. Let's go.
okay, guys, it looks like the hostages are in the back right corner of the store in the deli section.
we're gonna need options if we're gonna avoid a Sierra shot.
boss, Adam's mom's here.
Mrs. Jackson, I'm Sergeant Parker.
how's Adam? Is he all right?
he's unharmed, ma'am, but he's in a lot of trouble.
he's in there with the other kid. They robbed the store.
it went south. And they took hostages.
no, no, no, that's crazy.
there is some misunderstanding.
he is only 17.
you have got to get him out of there.
can I ask you something? - Yes.
does the name D-Roc mean anything to you?
that's his best friend.
do you have an address?
somewhere on, on, Kuniff Crescent.
thank you. Lewis, you copy? - Got it.
okay. Do you know if Donnie's been diagnosed with any disorders or conditions?
I don't know. It wouldn't surprise me.
that's one good thing about us moving: getting Adam away from Donnie.
I have to call my husband.
you're moving?
Yes. - Thank you.
please don't do this.
just be quiet.
you should... you should get the phone.
don't tell me. I know.
I'm trying to figure this out.
look down.
please?
you're pregnant? - 20 weeks.
it's a boy.
I didn't know. I didn't know.
it's okay, but... but now you do, right?
so you can let me go.
look, you didn't sign up for this.
please help me.
bro, I've been thinking. - Me, too.
all right, you see that lady over there? - We need to get a chopper.
we get a chopper, we can get out of here.
Donnie... Think it through!
if we get a chopper, they can't chase us!
you're not thinking straight.
I'm the one who's trying to get us out of here.
you're not thinking straight. - The last thing we need is...
look out behind you! He's got a knife!
subject has shot the guard. The guard is down!
shot fired! Shot fired!
what did you do?!
what did you do?!
10: 05 p. m. Shot fired. Guard hit.
why did you shoot him?
he was going to kill you.
you saw the way he came at you.
it was him or you.
I just wanted to help my dad.
this is bad, Donnie. D-Roc!
use the aliases.
there's a man bleeding here that you shot!
we're going to jail!
we've got a man down. Medics stand by. Gunshot wound.
Eddie, we got to step this up.
copy. Entering loading dock.
stupid, stupid, stupid.
d, stop.
stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid!
stop. Chill, man. Come on.
all right. Chill? How about this?
or how about this?
pick up the phone. Pick up the phone. Pick up the phone.
I'm so sorry.
he didn't mean... He didn't mean to shoot.
he didn't mean to shoot... He didn't mean to shoot!
give me the phone!
they'll hear us if we blast that.
all right, Wordy, there it is. Right there.
all right, you stay here and contain. - All right.
give it to me!
okay, okay.
listen to me. - I'm listening.
you can see in here, right?
I know you can see. You saw what happened.
he came at my friend with a knife.
what would you do, huh?
someone came at your best friend with a knife?
no, you were trying to protect your friend. I hear you, D-Roc.
that's right. You got that right.
that's what you do.
and that's why I'm here, trying to talk to you.
trying to keep you and Adam safe. Okay?
now, how's that guard doing?
I need you to help the guard.
what? No. No, no, no, no, no. I can't.
please. Because we can't go in for murder. All right?
robbery is one thing, but if the guy dies...
what am I supposed to do?
you're a nurse. - I'm a dental hygienist.
just do what you can, okay?
just do what you can, please.
he reay needs your help.
I don't care if it's complicated, smart g...
give me some washcloths. Plastic wrap, whatever.
okay.
Hey, where are you going?
I don't have time to explain, okay?
she's helping the guard and we need stuff.
he knows your name.
he knows your name, dude.
that's okay. It's okay.
just be ready to leave, okay?
I told him we wanted a chopper.
what is wrong with you?
the only way we're getting out of here is with our hands in the air or with our backs on a stretcher.
you don't know that. - Yes, I do. We're not getting out.
well, we have to.
it's over.
it's not. It's not over.
look, I'm helping those people.
what about the plan? - There's no plan, Donnie!
we're finished.
wait!
come on.
let go of me.
Hey, boss? Donnie's mom just got here. - Okay.
I'm Sergeant Greg Parker. I'm in charge of the negotiation.
on the way over here, an officer was telling me what's going on inside with Donnie.
that Donnie shot someone. Is that true?
I'm afraid so, Christine.
the man's alive, but needs immediate medical attention.
I know this is hard for you, but can you tell me about your son?
where do I start?
it's just... he's had the year from hell.
Yeah.
go on, please.
well, he's never been the same kid since...
since Travis passed away.
I'm sorry to hear that. Now, Travis...?
his brother. His big brother.
Donnie worshipped him.
Yeah. Could see that must be tough on him.
Donnie's father
my ex
he-he left sometime after and then Donnie just slid from As to Cs to Ds and then...
he just got into all sorts of trouble at school and... All sorts of trouble.
sergeant, please.
I have already lost one son, and Donnie is all I have left, and I can't... I can't lose my boy, please.
Christine, that's the last thing I want to do.
I want to do everything I can to g Donnie out of there safely, okay?
all right? - Thank you.

Where's my chopper?
we're still working on that, Donnie.
how do you know my name?
I spoke to your mom.
I spoke to both your moms.
and they're-they're worried about you guys.
I know you're worried about Adam, too.
I hear he's moving away, huh?
Oh, he's not moving away. He's not going anywhere.
Where's the chopper?
is that what Adam wants, too?
I want the chopper!
maybe I'm not making myself very clear.
so I'll make it very clear.
I want a chopper now!
let's get Adam's cell phone number.
let's try to go through him. - Copy that.

my mom. Wants to know if I'm all right.
I'll get rid of her.
okay.
I understand, but we need your help talking him down.
don't be. I'll be with you.
what are you doing?
what were you doing with the phone?
what I said.
texting my mom.
what, you don't believe me?
come on, Donnie.
we got to get out of here.
what do you think I've been trying to do?
I mean, we got to walk out, hands in the air. - No!
it will just be me and you.
like it's always been.
like it's always been.
Yeah. You and me.
go.
your girlfriend needs you.
okay, guys, we got Adam cooperating here.
we're on a three-point plan.
Wordy's on a covert earbud delivery.
ed and Sam, secure positions on the roof.
spike and Donna, explosive entrs through the front on my command.
I'll get a window charge ready.
Wordy, you locate the entry to the vent yet?
affirmative. You sure you want to let a 17-year-old kid talk down an EUP?
we got a man down losing a lot of blood.
we got to move fast, and Adam's our best option to end this right now.
that kid says the wrong thing, it's going to get way out of hand.
things always get way out of hand.
Hey, I'm in no hurry to pull the trigger on someone barely old enough to drive, all right?
okay. This is good to go.
ed, Sam, update!
we're on the move.
with haste, gentlemen. With haste!
got to get these folks out of there.
I'm heading to the drop. Steer me in.
Yep, I got you on my screen, Wordy.
taking the heating duct highway.
cozy, huh? - Yeah, real cozy.
is he okay?
he's shot.
are you okay?
how bad is he? Can I...
I just want to see if you...
there's clotting in the blood at the site of the wound.
if we move it now, we destroy all the healing that's been happening.
I knew you could help him.
I help pull wisdom teeth.
I'm not a doctor.
okay. That's it, Wordy. Keep going.
you're approaching a drop right now.
okay, I see it coming.
Hey, Lew, how much weight are these things ready to hold up, anyway?
I don't know, man. I guess we're going to find out.
great.
thirsty.
I'm sorry. You can't have anything.
but they're going to have us out of here at any minute, and you'll be in surgery before you know it.
are you a doctor?
no. I'm...
I'm a medical professional.

I know, and you're being really patient.
I want to thank you for that.
you're a smart guy.
What'd I tell you about playing me?
paper towels. - I got to tell you, I'm running out of patience.

he'll see that earbud, all right? Remember that.
now, just talk to Donnie about what he's been through this year.
acknowledge how ha it must have been.
d... I know this year has been the worst... ever.
Travis died and your dad bailed.
it's been brutal.
that's great. That's great.
you've always been there for him.
but you know I've always been there for you, man.
I know.
and, Donnie, I-I'll always be, no matter what.
no, you won't.
I shot a guy.
I'm going to prison, and you're going to jail, too.
no, that's not true. - It is!
now, Adam, it's gonna be okay.
it's gonna be okay.
just... you're his friend.
remember that. Just be his friend.
okay, look... I'm not gonna lie to you.
all right, this situation sucks.
but... thing is...
you can get through it together.
but what?
Adam? What are you doing?
Adam, don't touch your ear.
nothing.
what's that?
what the hell is that?!
nothing! It's for my phone!
no, it's not. Who gave that to you?
no one. It's mine.
the cops?
how could you?
Eddie, you got good eyes on this kid? - Yeah.
and what do you see? - He's scared.
and what else?
boss, barricaded subjects usually stay elevated.
this kid's ping-ponging.
okay, as long as he stays deescalated, we stand down.
sierra 1 standing by.
the cops?
you've been talking to the cops?
d, no. I...
it's all right, Adam. It's all right.
just slow him down, ay? Just slow him down.
they tell you to say all that?
no, it was me.
I thought I could trust you. - Donnie.
boss? - Adam, we're done. Walk away.
stop listening to them! - Put the gun down.

I know you won't do it!
Donnie, please.

entry Team, go!
in pursuit. - Copy.
hands on your head! Hands on your head right now!
stay down!
he's lost a lot of blood.
I trusted you. - Donnie, listen.
Adam, get back. Get out of there. - Oh, don't hu him!
you sold me out. - Put the gun down.
I was trying to get us out of this.
drop the gun! Put the gun down.
drop it! Put the gun down.
Donnie, I need you to put the gun down. Do it now.
no. Let me talk to him.
put it down, son. Put it down.
put it down! - No.
please! He'll listen to me.
he won't... He won't hurt me.
he hasn't got anybody else.
get out of here. I got nothing to say to you. Go!
I'm not going anywhere.
Donnie, it's gonna be okay.
Oh, it's gonna be okay
look at... Look at me. It's not.
boss?
team, Donnie's at a breaking point here, and he's dangerous to everyone in there.
now, we got one shot at this.
Eddie, we got to save this kid from himself here.
so, it's your call, but I ink we got to let Adam talk to him again.
Hey, Sam, that gun goes up, it's over. - Copy.
what am I going to do?
what am I going to do?
son, don't do it.
don't do it, son.
son?
look, Donnie, it's me. Just me.
listen, I don't care where we are
in Lethbridge, in jail.
doesn't make a difference.
but you do this, it's all over.
remember? We're brothers.
and brothers... need to be there for each other.
always?
always.
put the gun down.
that's it. That's it.
Yes. That's good work. That is good work.
look, I,uh... I just...I wanted to say sorry for riding you so hard.
I just had to know that your...
that your head's in the game, that's all.
no problem.
I'll see you tomorrow. - Sam?
my girlfriend is gonna break up with me tonight.
I didn't know you were seeing anybody.
Yeah, well. Anyway.
you want to grab a beer first? - No, I can't.
come on. I'm buying. - Rain check.
all right, tomorrow night.
actually... - Tomorrow.
okay. That'd be good.
maybe they weren't meant to be.
you know what? They never really looked like a couple to me.
how'd you know there was something up?
I figured it out.
how'd you do that?
because I'm special that way.
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.
let me buy you a soda.
it's not if, it's when I'm going to go back on the team, Sam.
okay, so, the boss knows.
right, which is exactly why we can't be together if I'm gonna go back. You know that.
I love you, Sam, but I've worked my whole life for this j and the team, and I'm not gonna let getting shot stand in the way of me going back.
you mean I'm not going to stand in your way?
Jules, that's the first time you told me you loved me.
I didn't think it would be like this.
Sam... - Look, I get it.
I get it. I do.
well, there's always the other choice if we want to stay together.
only one of us has to leave the team.
what are they doing?
Jessie, I think we're done!
Terry, look!
they're going to shoot!
they're going to kill us!
cover's blown, lewis, you got no time.
take the shot, Lou.
hold on, hold on, hold on!
what are they doing? We have a baby?
hey Jess?
Jess, you there?
Jess, it's me.
look, I know you're there, just listen.
I'm not saying you don't got every right to be pissed.
but what i been through in these last few months it's made me realize, it's made me see.
I've changed and I'm ready.
I just wanna be with you and our baby boy.
what's wrong?
he's gone Terry.
I gave him up, I gave our baby away.
what?
is that the guy?
good...
it's good when they run, huh?
Yeah.
save some for the rest of us. - will do.
four arrests, one warrant.
I know what you're thinking, that is some kind of record, Ed.
how do you do it?
well, Greg, I find...
parker: how's she doing?
she's fine.
parker: she shot a cop in the line of the duty.
she did her job.
parker: and you're saying she's got no reaction, no issues.
no... I'm saying.
you cut me some slack when I had issues.
she deserves the same.
I told you I was pregnant, you went out for smokes and what, how many months later you come back?
that's messed up.
I was just doing a lot of thinking.
yeah well, so was I.
they made this introduction book.
the agency showed it to me.
look at the house they got on the bridlepath.
I've never even been up there.
and then I told myself, doesn't he deserve that?
you know, when he was born something in me just said, this is wrong.
and then I was trying to tell myself that feelings were wrong, that it was the right thing to do.
and I tried calling them once to change my mind, but they only have three weeks and it was one past...
but it was the right thing to do.
it was just the right thing to do.
Terry, I'm so sorry.
no, no, no, I'm the one who left.
I'm the one spent the last two years a mess.
but you, you don't have a thing to be sorry for.
except for maybe hooking up with in the first place.
but I'm here now and if you'll let me I want to make this work.
does he have a name?
I don't know.
well, what were you gonna name him?
Really? - yeah.
can we just do one last thing?
come on, sweetie.
Terry, I don't think this is such a good idea.
you said they were nice people.
nice people aren't gonna say no.
hey Jessie.
what's this about?
it's Andrew, right?
look Andrew, I'm Terry.
I'm the father of...
look, I know this is a bit weird but we just wanted to know if we could just see our baby, your baby, I mean.
absolutely not. That was never part of the arrangement.
who is it?
let's just go.
it's uh, Jessie.
hi Jessie?
it's all right, Andrew.
is everything okay?
you look so happy. That's great.
Yeah.
thanks to you and your decision.
so what did you name him?
what's that, Jewish?
Irish. - Nice.
Yeah.
listen, it's about time to wrap it up, okay?
okay.
can I hold him?
Oh, I don't think we're comfortable.
please, I'm never going see him again.
I just want to...Just once before we go.
please.
please.
okay. - Okay.
just watch his head. - Okay.
got him? - Yeah.
I think it's time for Owen to come home.
Terry, what're you talking about?
okay Andrew. - Yeah, yeah, it's okay.
okay, you have exactly one minute to get the hell out of our house.
no, I'm sorry, but Jessie's changed her mind.
isn't that right, Jessie?
no, I... - Jessie. Jessie.
you had your three weeks, okay, Jessie.
it's the law, you can look it up.
you're so young, you can have another baby.
we already have a baby.
and we're not leaving without him.
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.
Hey, once we get a lawyer.
lawyer? Wait a minute. Okay, I am a lawyer, all right.
what are you going to do? What lawyer do you have?
you think you're so much better than me?
Terry. - Okay.
calm down.
I think I've spent more time with the baby and that makes me more of a father to him than you are.
you wanna see the kind of father I am?
Terry, stop it!
we can't...
get the hell out of our house, okay?
no, not without our boy.
no, Terry!
go get Owen!
listen, you're both upset. I've been there, all right?
you don't know me.
I know what it's like.
I know what's it's like to want a child more than anything else in the world.
shut up! - It can make you do crazy things. It does, okay?
you don't know me! Shut up!
Terry, there's a two-Way alarm in the nursery, the police are going to hear everything you say.
shut up!
I'm sorry.
parker: Okay, we've got a home invasion in progress.
unis are on their on way and it sounds like there's a child on the scene.
Winnie, let's hear the live feed from the home security.
patch that through.

I got their car keys.
Oh my god! - Let's get Owen.
no, no, we can't do that.
you see this?
why shouldn't this be us?
Andrew? Andrew? Help me!
we just want to make sure the baby's okay, Cindy.
you tell me my husband's okay.
what did you do to him?
Cindy, open the door!
less lethal all around. No tasers, no gas.
wait for weapons on my go.
and nothing, repeat, nothing, till we have a 20 on that baby.
copy.
Cindy, open the door!
sounds like it's escalating. We gotta move fast on scene.
spike, Lewis, approach on black.
copy that. - got it.
Jessie, get out! You get out!
Cindy, we're not gonna hurt you, okay?
Donna, Wordy, you've got white.
shields on everyone. - Where is he?
parker: Winnie, sounds to me like the homeowners know who the invaders are.
let's see what the connection is.
why the care for the child?
Winnie: Homeowners are Andrew and Cindy Greenwood.
checking for a Terry and Jessie now.
the police can hear everything.
they're on their way. They're coming.
get away from that!
we just lost audio, folks.
no please, please, don't do this.
okay, okay, it's not safe for him.
what, you think i'm gonna hurt him?
he's my boy.
give him to me, please. Okay?
no. No. No, no.
give us our boy now.
Cindy. - you want to see Andrew again?
give us our baby.
Cindy, give him to me, okay?
see?
he needed his mommy.
okay, baby.
okay, okay, okay, okay.
we gotta go, now. What do we need? What do we need?
I... I don't know. What do we need? - What do we need?
okay, okay, it's cold.
you have to put him in this.
Oh god.
okay.
you need a blanket.
you should take this one, I just washed it.
and a bottle.
Winnie: Greenwoods just went through an adoption.
took official custody two months ago.
can't get the name of the biological mother, give me two more minutes.
parker: That's why the concern, it's hers.
Jessie, Jessie, look at me Jessie.
please don't do this.
you can come and see him whenever you want.
you can come everyday, I swear to god.
we can work something out.
I'm sorry, Cindy, but he needs to be with his mommy.
he needs to be with people who really love him.
we do.
we do. We love him.
come on, baby. We gotta go now.
we got to go right now. - No! No, Jessie.
no, please!
got the car keys, let's go.
team, neighbours just called in Greenwood's minivan.
silver, light-gray bmw just pulled away.
I got them. Right here in the intersection.
if they run, we ram them before they leave the scene.
copy that.
parker: Donna, possible baby on board.
stand down. Stand down.
the baby!
Terry, no!
team one, we've got a vehicular pursuit.
standard formation to start, but if there's a baby on board, it changes everything.
sabine, you good to go? -I'm on it.
I'm gpsing the area now.
okay, if they have the baby we're limited here.
no road Spikes, no collisions, no shooting out the tires.
unis at the house confirm, baby's been taken.
ed, how about a rolling roadblock?
negative. We've got a school zone coming up. Can you make contact?
copy. Winnie, I want to know who these folks are.
okay.
two names, Jessie Wyeth and Terry, no surname yet.
wyeth's nineteen, biological mother.
gave her baby up two months ago.
possible post-partum depression, separation anxiety, or maybe psychosis.
how about the male?
nothing yet, I'm on it.
okay, does she have parents of her own we can contact?
wyeth's mother's listed as deceased, three years ago.
overdose.
no father I can find.
this girl is alone, except for that guy and this baby.
I'm turning onto bayview.
what's going on?
what do you think is going on? They're still coming.
fine. Let them come.
give us a nice police escort right to the lawyer's office.
what lawyer, Terry?
Terry, what lawyer?
krugman. We'll go see him.
No! You still owe him for the last time, remember?
the robbery thing.
it wasn't robbery, it was theft under a thousand.
porter, we can see if she can help.
no, she said you couldn't call her anymore.
you know, if we're gonna be a family you're going to have to have this stuff thought out, Terry.
I'm thinking!
don't scream.
you're scaring him.
it's the police.
you tell them we're not getting out of this van until we got a lawyer.
Hello?
parker: Hi, my name is sergeant gregory parker.
I'm with the police strategic response unit.
am I speaking with Jessie Wyeth?
Yes. I'm so sorry, you'll have to speak up here.
parker: oh, it sounds like you've got your hands full over there.
that's a hungry cry.
how do you know?
parker: Oh, I'll never forget that sound.
your baby wants a bottle.
what's your baby's name?
his name's Owen.
parker: So, what do you say Jessie, we all stop, get owen some formula?
maybe you can tell us your side of things?
no, we have the formula in the diaper bag.
but Terry says we can't stop until we have a lawyer.
parker: Okay, I can work on that, but it'll be a lot easier for me to do if we aren't speeding down the highway.
it'd be safer too for Owen.
Terry, I think we should stop.
what's he saying to you? Whatever he's saying, you know he's lying.
no, he's just saying we should stop and be safe for owen.
Yeah. And then we stop and they get him.
where do you think he's going? You wanna call Tami and ask her right now?
no. He's not going to Tami's.
Yeah,'cuz I'm not going to let that happen! Now hang up the phone!
hang up the phone!
okay, I'm sorry.
parker: Jessie, don't hang up.
please, we need a lawyer.
shh, it's okay.
parker: All right, let's go to plan b.
Lewis, be ready with that gps launcher?
yes sir.
spike, get into position. Aim for the rear bumper.
spike: Copy that.
we can make this work, Lou, we can back off.
Donna, we're the distraction on my go.
parker: Go now.
what are they doing?
Jessie, I think we're done.
Terry, look!
they're going to shoot!
they're going to kill us!
cover's blown. Lewis, you got no time.
parker: Take the shot, lou.
hold on to owen! Hold on!
what are they doing? We have a baby!
got it.
it's holding, boss. All good.
parker: Good.
signal's up.
we got him tagged with a gps, let's see where he's going.
Donna: Spike, I'm going to fall back.
spike: Copy that.
parker: I'm going to pull back, let them slow down and keep that baby safe.
Donna: Copy that.
copy. Falling back.
Jess, it's okay, we lost them.
I think we need to stop this.
all I want is what everybody wants.
I know, I want it too, but I mean...
all that time i was away all I could think of was you, us and him, all together.
where were you, Terry?
what did you do?
boss, the girl listed a Terry Dornan as next of kin on her hospital form.
that's great, Winnie. Go ahead.
if this is him he's got a record and a long history of violence.
listen to this, two months ago he almost killed a guy.
Winnie: Terry Sebastian Dornan, 20 years old.
last few months he was in jail for assault.
on the 15th of June police were called to 1678 ossington where Mr. Dornan and an acquaintance, Kurt Lawford, shared an apartment.
upon arrival police noted blood on the walls, floor, and ceiling.
Jess, I can do this for you and him, but I just want to do one more thing.
I really think we should stop now, Terry.
please, just one more thing then we'll go downtown and we'll turn ourselves in.
okay, one more thing.
boss, we lost them.
Yeah.
I see them, taking the off-ramp.
okay team, let's take the next exit and look back.
I just want to do one thing as a family, jess.
it'll be great, you'll see. Okay?
team, any eyes on the subject?
negative.
Winnie, you still trying that number?
no answer the last four times.
okay, keep trying.
anything else on Dornan? Background, family, anything?
Winnie: Both parents are dead.
though they didn't die together, mother died, looks like some sort of car accident.
he was four.
father, I'm just getting a date, almost a year later.
after that I'm getting multiple addresses for Dornan.
over ten, till he was 18.
parker: Yeah, those aren't relatives, those are foster homes.
keep looking, guys.
Terry, what are we doing?
Terry, we can't go in there.
just trust me, it's gonna be great. He's going to love it.
look, we're okay.
Winnie: Boss, I got her. Here she is!
parker: Jessie, hey it's Greg Parker again.
I'm really glad to hear that you're okay.
so where are you?
we're in... We're safe, okay?
and we're gonna turn ourselves in, we just need to do this one thing.
parker: Owen's still hungry, huh?
how are you coming with that formula?
I don't know how to make it.
I should know this!
what am i doing?
Jessie, you know who's born knowing this stuff?
nobody.
having a baby, that's one thing, but taking care of him honey, that's something else.
you can't do it on the run.
Oh yeah, well, if I was a real mother, you know, I would have learnt, I wouldn't have just given him up.
or you knew what your baby would need and made sure he got it like a real mother would.
so Jessie, why don't you tell me where you are.
we're at the northern dreampark, okay?
we're almost done and then we're coming in downtown.
okay Jessie, just stay on the line.
I gotta go.
parker: Eddie, northern dreampark.
copy that.
let's step on it, folks. - Ready?
Terry, can we go now?
Yeah.
what's this?
it's just one last thing.
I know exactly where it is, he's gonna love it.
Terry, come on.
please. - Let's just go.
please. Please.
come on.
I can't wait for you to see this and Owen too.
parker: Winnie, Jessie mentioned a Tami, some connection to Dornan find out what it is.
Winnie: I'm on it.
what do you think?
well?
Yeah, it's pretty. - Come on, come on.
all right, I'm sierra one. Spike and Lewis, alpha team, west side of the park.
wordy and Donna, east side of the park, bravo team.
Wordy: Weapons?
Dornan may not be armed, but he's violent and unstable.
so tasers, if we can.
what about long-range?- Rubber bullets. That baby is the priority.
if he gives us no choice, we do what we got to do.
clear? - Clear.
I don't think...
guys, get going.
Donna, you got a problem?
no, I'm good.
you sure? - Yeah.
let's go!
you all right? - Yep. You good?
Yeah.
here, give him to me.
please. - You sure?
okay.
Terry, watch his head, watch his head. - I got it, I got it.
parker: Okay team, keep me posted.
nothing yet, boss.
no joy here either.
right down here? - Yup.
you know, when your daddy was almost 4 his mommy and his daddy came here.
and your daddy, well, he thought the whole world lived in this park.
and at the centre of this world was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen.
horses and families, everybody together.
Eddie, I'm about to talk to this Tami.
see what more we can get on our subject here.
if you see him, let me know right away.
copy that.
no, i spent more time in court with him than all my other kids combined.
what did he do now?
how long did he live with you?
two years.
time he was sixteen to the time he walked out.
can't say I was sorry.
quite a handful, huh?
no, a handful's what I'm used to.
you ever spend the night with a baby's not getting his crack from mommy's milk?
that I'm used to.
when Terry came everybody said, look, this is a really hard one.
I said, yeah, hard or not, every kid wants love and that I got to give.
okay.
so what made him different?
look, no kid likes a foster home.
every kid wants to believe that some day mommy and daddy are going to come back and everything's going to be better.
well, Terry never even had that, his mother dead from that accident, and then his father, I don't know, maybe you just never get over something like that.
what happened to his father?
Oh, and this one.
this one.
this was my favorite, he'd never forget it.
and my daddy.
Hey, you know what his name was?
it was Owen.
just like you, buddy.
there's nothing in quadrant e2.
no dice in w4.
I need a better vantage point.
thank you.
sierra 1 in position.
no sign.
hold on, hold on.
at the carousel. Bravo team, that's closest to you.
there it is. - Okay.
Wordy, Donna, stealth approach.
alpha team, what's your 20?
spike: Alpha team's on the move and we're far.
I didn't cry.
well, you were 4, Terry he's just a baby.
give him to me.
I thought we were gonna go downtown together.
Yeah, we will.
then what are they doing here?
Terry, I'm sorry.
when I go to jail you'll probably never see me again, right?
you'll just give me up.
we were supposed to be together.
supposed to?
Terry, we did all of this together.
he's escalating, he's got the baby.
you know, maybe it doesn't matter how much we want it.
we have to think about what he needs, okay? Give him to me.
No! - No?
it's too late.
give him to me.
No!
he's seen us. - Cover's blown, we're in pursuit.
Wordy, on the girl. Donna, follow the male.
spike and Lou, get to the carousel.
I got him. - You got him?
splitting up.
stay right there. Stay right there!
I gotta go, I gotta go. - I know, I know, I know.
I can't let him go alone.
I need you to calm down.
listen, I know. - Wordy, hold on, I got him.
Donna, wait on my go.
boss, he's heading for the stairs and he's got the baby.
Eddie, stop him.
he's too far to tase.
then go lethal.
rubber bullets?
they might not do it, Ed, if he makes it up there that baby could die.
copy that.
I don't have a clear shot.
sabine, do you have the solution?
sabine, you have scorpio, take the shot.
negative. No solution.
the baby's in jeopardy.
he's going up the coaster, but he can't go any place once he's at the top.
Yes, he can.
he can go the way his father went, he can jump.
Donna, Wordy, wait on my lead.
copy. - Copy.
hey Terry, wait up, buddy.
it's me, Greg Parker. I want to help you.
I have to get up there!
I have to get up there!
listen, there's nothing you can do up there but put yourself in danger.
he has my baby!
Terry, hey it's me, Greg.
come on.
hold up a second.
Hey, I just want to talk to you.
it's okay.
it's all right.
you get her out of here. I made her do this, she shouldn't have to see this!
what this? What do you mean?
Hey, can I talk to you for a second, just man to man, what do you say?
know what I see?
I see a guy who's trying to do the right thing but suddenly finds himself in the wrong place.
is that close?
I bet you don't even want to be up here.
in fact, I bet you can't imagine why you're even up here.
what, do you think i'm stupid?
no.
I think you got feelings.
I think you got big, gigantic feelings, the kind that just come out of your stomach and make you feel like what do you do sometimes.
and you've never had anybody in your life to teach you about those feelings, to help you with those feelings.
and that's not fair.
Oh, I had lots of people, loads of families.
different one every year.
sure.
they've never been your real family, right?
what's going on?
it's under control.
my ma died when I was just 4.
I know.
yeah? You know what happened to my old man?
you know that too?
parker: Yeah, yeah, I do.
that's why I want to help you.
five years old.
my ma's dead not a year.
and we go up to the top of our building.
parker: Hey, just stay th me, buddy. Just stay with me.
and I remember he puts me down by the door and he gives me a piece of paper.
I can't read.
I don't know what's on it.
and I'm just standing there, looking up at my dad as he walks to the edge.
Terry, you're not your father.
you're your own person.
so what's wrong with me?
nothing.
what is wrong with me?
nothing.
nothing's wrong.
still have the solution, but no way to take him out without the baby going over too.
copy that.
all I want is what everybody gets.
what do you want? You tell me.
I want my family.
I want to come home and they're there every day, no matter what.
I want my little boy to look at me and say, daddy, don't leave.
and I say, I would never.
parker: You've got it.
you've got it. You've already got it. You've got Jessie.
she loves you. She loves you.
she wants you to come back down safe.
you and Owen.
Oh my god, he's bleeding.
parker: No, no, no, Terry, it's okay.
it's just your hand. It's okay. It's okay.
look at what I'll do every time, won't I?
no, no, it doesn't have to go that way.
it doesn't have to go that way.
it's going to be okay.
no.
you were the one who told Jessie he was hungry.
that's right.
probably still is hungry.
why don't we go feed him together, come on.
go feed him together, okay?
come on. Come on, that's it.
that's it.
okay. Thank you.
team, be ready.
take care of him for me.
you bet.
here we go, here we go.
that's it, I got him.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
parker: You're not going anywhere.
you're not going anywhere.
don't go. Don't go, Terry, don't go. Don't go, my man.
no, no!
no, no, Terry.
I'm sorry.
we'll debrief later, all right?
all right. Okay. - Okay.
Jessie, there's a police officer over there, he's ready to take a statement.
did he say anything before he...
Yeah, he said to take care of him for me.
his dad wrote that, in a note.
I have to take owen now, Jessie.
his name's Liam.
I'm sorry.
the subject's family history made suicide likely and the danger to the infant was extreme.
I gave the order to take the shot.
constable Sabine was unable to do so and the subject made it to the structure and ascended.
Donna, you have anything to add?
at this point constables Sabine and Wordsworth pursued the subject.
Hey, tomorrow we're going to do this debrief again.
and you're telling the boss what really happened.
because, Donna, the only thing's that more dangerous than a cop who shoots too fast, is a cop who can't shoot when they need to.
now you had the shot, and I saw it.
you saw it? Where were you then? - Yeah
because where I was there I pointing a gun at a scared kid with a baby in his hands.
we got an order.
you questioned the order.
Yeah, I did, but the boss had information we didn't have.
I asked a question and then I did my job like any member of this team is supposed to.
all right?
are you a member of this team?
Yes.
that's good.
Donna: Does this job get any easier?
no.
I told you what I had to do.
Derek, I know where you are. We're coming there now.
stay away.
alpha team on our way.
Bravo on two. East stairs.
you got to trust yourself, Derek. You don't want to do this.
no, I don't. But I have to.
no way. It's not going to happen.
if you guys want to do this, you're going to have to go through me.
all right, bring it. See what you got.
go ahead, go pass. What you got? Oh, the fake!
what you got?
Oh, nice one! Schooled me. Good job. That was good.
okay, Nash and Shaq, all right.
my dinner's getting cold, but good teamwork, guys.
Mattie, how many times I got to tell you to lock the door behind you when you get home.
Mattie, come on, volume, please.
hope you're hungry. I stopped at burger shed, picked you up sdoublepicy.
Oh, gee, Derek, thanks, man. My favorite.
I mean, I know you had classes all day.
and you gotta work at the hospital in a few hours-- But, hey, thanks, man.
you can have some fries, but you got to finish your salad first.
and then I want to see some homework. - I'm not hungry.
not hungry?
you okay?
what's wrong? You sick?
Mattie, what happened? - Nothing.
what do yo mean nothing? Don't tell me nothing! What happened?
nothing. It was an accident.
Mattie, talk to me.
come on, it's a bullet wound.
I know a bullet wound when I see one.
got to get you to the hospital. - No, I can't go to the hospital. If the cops find out...
if you don't go to the hospital, this could open up and you'll bleed to death.
I'm not going. I'm not going. - We're going.
all right, hold on.
tug man, move your ass.
it's Shane, it's Shane. It's Shane. - What?
go, go, go, go.
what floor you say he's at? - Eight I think.
you think? - I mean, yeah, eight.
all right, come on.
Shane Thomas. He shot you.
what the hell you doing with him, Mattie?
with all that we have been through, tell me you're not running with these guys.
I'm sorry, D. You've been working so hard and I wanted to ...
come on, Mattie.
when you was my age, you was already running with the east side crew.
Yes, and look where that got us.
I'm sorry, all right? It was an accident, I swear.
Derek, we can't tell nobody. Derek, please.
I know someone at the hospital who can help us. All right?
I got your back. - You got my back.
you' not doing it right.
I'm doing it how you told me to do it.
no, you're doing it like someone who didn't listen to how I told him to do it.
okay. - Communication, repetition, affirmation.
the secret to every great marriage.
boss, we up for a drink tonight, or what?
I can't. I got to finish this article-- critical incidence newsletter.
who says Greg Parker doesn't know how to have a good time.
I don't get it. I gave her a new gyro just last week. I thought we were good.
maybe it's not you, maybe it's her.
officer Callaghan, how you doing? - You really want to know?
well, unless the answer is "outstanding," not really.
I get it. I mean, eight gun calls, two warrants a day-- it's exhausting.
what? - It's been a long week.
copy that.
but it's what we do though, right? - Yep.
he's gone, man. - I can see that.
looks like you tagged him pretty good.
obviously not good enough.
yo, give me some of that.
man, it's a spicy burger. You don't even eat spicy burgers.
don't tell me I don't eat... - y'all shut up? God!
yo, I say we wait for him here, man.
whatever. Shane what do you want to do?
it ain't about what I want. The kid's a loose end.
Yeah, the kid's a loose end. So?
so we chill. Wait for him to come home.
we're going to him.
it's okay. Come on.
you all right, buddy? Hold on. Let's go find Trudy.
Trudy. - Hey, you're early.
Trudy, listen...
are you Mattie? Your brother talks about you all the time.
listen, I need a favor.
what's wrong?
can you just look at my little brother, please?
but I need you to keep it quiet. He's been shot.
what?
he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
d, what's going on?
can we just fix him up and get him out of here?
gunshots have to be reported.
tru, I can't do that. You know how it works.
you said you were done with all that.
he didn't do anything.
it's okay. Look, I just need you to trust me.
he's my little brother.
I can't have social services take him away from me.
please.
this needs sutures. We need a doctor.
can't do that. - Derek...
Hey, I will make it up to you big time.
supply room in e wing.
get me some butterfly bandages and some saline.
we're going to have to flush it out. - Okay.
just don't let anybody see you, okay?
Oh, don't worry.
be back, okay?
make it up to you big time?
quiet.
Mattie, get the hell out of here!
can we get some help here please? Help!
tru, tru... tru, I'm so sorry. Tru.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
get some pressure dressing. - Got it, got it.
let's clear trauma one now.
sir, sir, give us some room. We've got some work to do here.
code red. Code red. O. R.
team one, hot call. Shots fired. Saint patrick's hospital.
once staff member down-- criticalonditi.
active shooter at large.
Jules, you spent a lot of time here after you got shot. You goah?
ye, kind of hoping not to see this place again so soon.
uncontrolled entrances, hundreds of rooms.
Pete, we've got a major containment challenge here, and we need all the extra uniforms we can get.
metro's sending everyone they have. Calling people off shift.
good. Put team four on alert.
and let's reach out to our neighbors in York and Durham regions, see if they can spare any brothers and sisters in blue.
copy. - What do you got?
hospital's in partial lockdown.
uniforms are checking people coming in and out.
not all the entrance points have been covered yet. Not enough bodies.
reinforcements on their way.
how long since our shooter's been active?
they said 12 minutes of quiet.
quiet is good. We like quiet.
Jules, talk to any contacts you might have in there.
we need more intel here. - Got it.
Pete, you got the name of the nurse that got shot?
Trudy Vargas. - I know her.
okay, let's see what kind of shape she's in.
maybe she can tell us what happened.
I understand, but there are armed men in my emergency room getting in the way of patients who need treatment. Now who's in charge?
I am.
sergeant Greg Parker with the sru.
Dr. Redfield. - Hi, doctor.
we need to set up a command post.
okay, you can do that in the admit office. It's just through the E. R. I'll take U.
thank you. How's Trudy Vargas doing?
we're stabilizing her. She's going to or in a few minutes.
it would help us if we could have word with her.
don't get in the way, don't stay too long.
that's her right there.
we tried to contain the panic, but...
but gunshots are loud, word gets around.
what if we evacuate the hospital?
400 patients? Ten in surgery as we speak, another dozen in icu.
now one of my best nurses is out commission. No way.
what if we put the patients in a secured area with lockable doors?
sounds like a plan.
you'll need to close shop for a while.
already rerouting calls to the mount, but they're at capacity as it is.
I set up a triage area in the west parking lot for more critical cases.
I know it's not ideal.
city hospital, sarge. It's never ideal.
through there to the right. - Thank you, doctor.
all right, good luck. Excuse me. I got to get back to my team.
kinda reminds me of you.
Really? - A little bit.
Shane, man, five-o's all over the place, man. We should bail.
give me your gun. - My gun? But there's cops...
man, give it to him.
I know the kid saw what you did, but...
what I did? What I did?
you better believe anyone finds out, we're all going down.
what, you think Mattie's gonna go to the cops?
the cops? I don't care anything about the damn cops, all right?
those...
we need to silence that kid, you understand me?
we need to do it now before he talks to anyone.
you think he talked to his brother?
well, if he did, then, uh...
we gotta take care of him, too.
you got a better idea?
all right then.
Hector! - Mattie, you okay?
Yeah, yeah. - All right. We gotta get outta here.
there's too many cops. We can't.
okay. Uh, upstairs.
5: 17 P. M. Establishing command post.
single shot fired, gunman at large, but gone to ground.
we got a central building, four wings.
ten floors, 16 stairwells.
north wing, most vulnerable patients: Icu and maternity.
Lewis, Wordy, you guys cover icu. - Copy.
Sam and I'll go take maternity, work our way downwards.
clear each floor till we flush the subject out.
leave a uniform sentry behind each secured area after we've cleared it, okay, so it stays that way.
spike, any visuals on our shooter?
sorry, boss. Limited camera coverage. He must have been in a blind spot.
okay, that's not a lot to go on here, gentlemen, so let's make the priority anyone not wearing a hospital gown or a unifo, ok?
let's get this guy while he's still quiet. - Copy that.
there. That should hold for now, anyway.
what are we gonna do? - I don't know yet!
Mattie, what the hell is Shane and his boys after you for?
I'm tired of this! What did you do?
nothin'. - Nothing?
put these on. We gotta blend.
these are girls.
you worried about the clothes?
they're trying to kill you, and you're worried about the clothes?
and they shot my friend who was just trying to help us!
I know. I know. I'm sorry.
look, Mattie, you need to start talking to me.
what's going on?
Shane wouldn't be coming at you like this unless it was something serious.
I di't steal anything!
I didn't do anything.
you saw something, didn't you?
did he pop somebody? Mattie?
Yeah. - Yeah.
he said he's gonna kill me.
he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill...
Mattie, Mattie, Mattie, Mattie, relax.
he's not gonna kill you. He's not gonna kill you.
look, look, I'm not gonna let that happen, okay?
little brother, I'm not gonna let that happen to you, okay?
okay. - All right? Okay.
excuse me.
you can't be in here right now. - I know. This is only gonna take a minute, though.
it's very important, okay?
okay. Okay.
Hey, Julianna.
Hey, Trulianna. How you doing?
you're back? - Yeah. Wearing the cool pants this time.
can you tell me what happened?
there was yelling. A-a fight.
okay, did you see who was it was?
Derek. Is he okay?
who's derek? - Medeiros.
he's a, he's a night orderly. Is he okay?
tell me he's okay. - You're gonna be okay.
please.
did you get that? - Yeah, copy.
boss, maternity's secure. - Copy that.
Derek Medeiros, he's has a record: B and e, vandalism, all from a couple of years ago.
anything violent?
not that he was arrested for, but it says here he was affiliated with the eastside crew.
if this guy's eastside, he probably did a lot worse than he got busted for.
gangbangers don't usually work the night shift ospi a htal.
sounds like he got out of the life.
if he did, he's one of the few.
once you're in, they make it real hard for you to get out in one piece.
Yeah, I hear you, Lou, but we have to consider him armed and dangerous until we know more.
if this is some kind of gang payback, we got more than one party at play here.
got a picture here of Derek. From the employee file.
sending it out.
we'll be moving her to surgery now. - Okay.
Trudy, do you know if this was a gang fight?
he brought his little brother Matt in.
it was a gunshot.
he wanted me to keep it quiet. But...
he's been, he's been taking care of Matt since his mom died.
he's been, he's been turning himself around.
is he in trouble? - We're gonna do everything we can.
please, please, Julianna. Keep him safe. - All right.
sounds like maybe the little brother is the gang conneion.
Peter, anything on him?
no juvie file on a Matt Medeiros.
looks like he's never been picked up.
okay, team, let's assume multiple subjects.
Peter, you focus on the brothers.
let's find out if anyone has a beef against them.
okay, hold on a sec. Boss, there's a call asking about Trudy.
nurse at the front desk says it sounds like derek's voice.
okay. Line two.
ready? - Yeah.
is this Derek? - Yeah.
Hey, Derek, my name is sergeant Greg Parker.
I'm with the police strategic response unit.
you wanted to know about Trudy? - Yeah.
uh, how is she?
she's doing okay. They're taking good care of her.
did you see who shot her?
okay, can you tell me this.
was it the same person who shot your brother?
eah.
okay, how many guys we talking about, Derek?
three.
and is Matt still with you?
Yeah, he is. - Who is that, the cops?
and you guys are still inside the hospital?
Yeah, we are. - We can't go op the CS.
great, Derek, okay.
I know you're trying to protect your brother, but if someone's after him, you'll both be safer with us, buddy.
you just think about this: Your brother's injured, he needs treatment.
you tell me where you are, we'll get him out of there safely, give him the help he needs.
you can come to us?
you, you promised.
you bet, buddy, right away.
north wing, fourth floor supply room.
that's it, I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead!
Mattie, what are you doing?
okay, guys, north wing, fourth floor supply room. Let's bring him in.
Copyalpha team on the move. Bravo?
closing in.
Matt! Hey, where do you think you're going?
I'm not going to the cops!
listen, I got to get you to a doctor and get you safe.
come on.
run. Run!
don't stop! Don't stop!
run! Keep running!
gunshots reported in geriatrics, third floor.
Bravo moving.
on my way.
Shane, this is crazy!
Medeiros, man, you shouldn't have got yourself involved.
this had nothing to do with you!
listen, listen, you don't have to do this!
you think I want this?
it ain't nothing personal, man, it's just... it's him or me!
and it ain't gonna be me, man, that's all!
come on, Shane, listen, nobody has to die, man, okay?
let's just chill! Let's talk about this!
all right, let's talk. Go ahead. I'm listening.
no joy.
my brother, he didn't see anything, okay?
he wasn't there. You've got my word.
man, I want to believe you.
but when his boys start asking, how I know Mattie won't crack under the pressure?
when whose boys start asking?
T-T. J.'S.
T. J? You saw Shane pop T. J.From the dragons?
Oh, Mattie!
talk and he knows he's a dead man!
second floor! Let's go.
Eddie, what the hell was that?
police! Freeze! - Come on, man, let's go!
put the gun down! Stay where you are! Put the gun down!
come on, man, let's go!
Sam, get the fire.
Wordy, Lewis, take the door.
right there, let's see some hands!
let's see some hands.
I got Matt. - What about Derek?
negative. He's still out there.
6: 31 pm, fire from explosion contained.
four armed subjects still at large.
one subject in custody.
subject's headed to ward six. - On my way.
Freeze! Police! Get your hands up! Get your hands up!
get down! Hands against the wall! Hands on the wall!
I got it. I got it.
subject contained.
gun's out. Your pants sliding a little bit?
let me get that for you.
Yeah, don't mention it. Come on.
Lou, Wordy, good job.
Sam, Jules, two subjects west corridor.
Wordy, east. - On it.
get him down to the boss. - Copy that.
Wordy, I'll catch up. - Copy, Lou.
boss, we're bringing down two subjects.
Eddie, stay with the kid. See if you can get anything out of him.
I'm on it.
it's Mattie, right? I'm Ed. Let's get you somewhere safe.
getting any deja vu? - Yeah. Mostly the smell.
spring blossom meets industrial disinfectant.
you in that hospital gown and bunny slippers.
panda slippers.
couple hundred times around these floors, you leaning on my arm.
Yeah. You did always like me best when I needed you, huh?
come on. Everyone needs to be needed.
gives you something to shoot for.
ward five clear. - Copy.
very impressive, Matt. It's very impressive.
how many guys after you? Three? You're what, 14?
you want to tell me why they want to shoot you?
I spent a lot of time on the street, Matt.
they want to keep you quiet.
I get why you don't want to talk to me. I get that.
it's just, I'm worried about your brother.
name's Theo Watts. Street name tug.
works as muscle for a meth dealer named Shane Thomas.
what crew they run with?
Oh, they're independent. They're trying to make a name.
that's not good.
okay, Spike. Keep talking to the guns and gangs guy. Get peter on it, too.
any red flags they might pull for today, today.
copy. - Okay.
Mr. Watts. How you doing? Okay?
my officer said...before he arrested you, he said that you reached behind you, the back of your pants.
now, I can interpret that two ways.
one, you were hitching-- you were hitching your pants up.
or you were drawing the concealed weapon you had back there.
now, wearing big baggy pants, that's not a serious offense, but drawing a gun on one of my officers, that really is.
I wasn't going to draw on anybody.
tell me why you shot a kid earlier today.
man, I didn't shoot no one. - No? 'Cause somebody did.
and now here you are, running around with a gun, shooting at that same kid.
you trying to finish the job?
Shane shoot him? - I don't know. Go ask him.
no, son, I'm asking you.
Robocops, man!
yo, what is that, aks they're carrying out there? - Calm the hell down.
no, man! They can shoot through walls with that stuff, man!
yo, yo, I'm out of here, man.
come on, Remo, you know I can't let you do that, man!
look, I already shot three people today, so I'm kind of running out of things to lose. You feel me?
so I need you to stop and think about what it is you're really trying to say to me right now, bro.
you know I got your back, man. Always.
what about t, man? - What about him?
he still hasn't called, man. What if he got busted?
then he better know how to keep his damn mouth shut.
all right. We need to split up. Might find them faster.
no, man.
you see them, you holler at me.
yo, Shane, you got my piece, man.
it's nothing to do with him. Derek didn't do anything.
so, it's just the two of you guys, right?
Yeah.
since our moms got killed.
I'm sorry to hear that, Matt.
but you guys are doing okay, right?
I mean, your brother's got a job.
and he is trying to look out for you, but right now, he's in danger of getting shot.
Matt, of getting shot. Okay?
and if you can just tell me what happened, I can help.
it doesn't matter.
me and my brother are dead.
if it's not today, it's tomorrow.
that's the way it is.
you cops can't do nothing about it.
let's go.
boss, got something from the guns and gangs unit. Could be relevant.
Yeah. Go ahead, Peter.
42 division found a bo about an hour ago idled as one john chen.
aka tj Chen, riverside dragons.
Oh, yeah? I'm guessing it wasn't natural causes.
that's right. Single gunshot to the head.
body was in an alley off Queen and Pape.
okay. Copy that, Eddie?
officer. I need you to stay here with this young man.
I need you to get a doctorooto lk at him immediately.
Mattie, I'm going to be back to get you, all right?
TJ Chen's head of the dragons.
they run the meth trade, Broadview to Woodbine.
so, if Shane and his crew were trying to do business down there, they'd have some friction.
Yeah, but taking out TJ's asking for serious payback.
the dragons find out it's Shane, he won't live to see the weekend.
unless there weren't any witnesses.
or the witnesses disappeared.
and we're sure this relates to TJ?
I don't know. Let's find out.
okay.
Mr. Watts. A couple more questions.
whatever, man. I ain't talking.
right. I get it. Okay.
I thought you might know something about a body they found today-- TJ Chen.
I don't know nothing about that. So, I can't speak on it.
okay, so you don't mind if we double-check that?
spike, let's get a picture of Mr. Watts here down to guns and gangs.
have them pass it around, see if anybody recognizes him from the neighborhood.
copy that.
should probably run it by the dragons, too, just to make sure.
copy. - Hey, hold up.
man, I wasn't there. I swear.
I found out after it all went down.
okay. It was Shane.
and the kid saw him do it.
get him out of here.
look, it was that kid's own fault, man.
he wasn't supposed to be there in the first place.
let's go talk to the kid, Ed.
Sarge, somebody raided a supply closet, lost a lot of blood.
it's got to be our subject.
Hey, guys. We found Derek's locker.
uh, looks like he was taking his medical career seriously.
he's making plans.
got a life ahead of him.
at least, this morning, he did.
can I have just a second? Thank you. Hey, Matt.
I'm Sergeant Parker. You remember Ed Lane.
Matt, does your brother know that you saw Shane shoot TJ?
it's all right. - Matt, it's important.
and does your brother know that you saw TJ get shot?
Yeah.
okay. Okay, good man.
we're going to leave this officer here to look out for you.
no, you got to let me... got to find my brother.
listen to me. Matt, we're going to find him, all right?
we're going to make sure he gets safe. That's our job.
sergeant Parker. - Hey, doctor. You got time to take care of our friend here?
Absolutely. - Thank you.
I need the cuffs off to treat him.
Hey, Matt, how you feeling?
so, Matt saw too much.
now he's the only thing linking Shane to a murder.
he's got to get to him before it gets back to the dragons.
so Derek's going after shane to save his brother?
Yeah, his only family. Wouldn't you?
Derek? Greg Parker again.
Where's my brother?
he's safe. Doctor's taking care of him.
and I want to keep you safe, too. We can protect you from Shane.
even if you find him, he'll be back on the street tomorrow.
no. We're not going to let that happen.
listen, the system is broken.
only one way I can make sure my brother is safe.
do this, you'll throw away everything you've done.
I'm sorry. I got to do this.
he's left the life.
but he still won't trust cops.
Matt said their mom got killed. It's personal.
spike, let's find out what happened to their mom.
copy. - We step this up, guys. Okay?
Derek's a good kid. He's worked hard to get where he's at.
we got to stop him before he crosses a line we can't pull him back from.
it's over.
n't keep the hospital contained, doctor, we lose the integrity of the sweep.
all I'm saying is others are at capacity.
they're overwhelmed out there in triage.
we need the building back as soon as possible or people are going to die.
okay, doctor.
guys, I got info on the boys' mom. Serena Medeiros.
fatally wounded in a shooting three years ago.
place called Pete's top slice.
Pete's? - No wonder he doesn't trust us.
what happened?
one night, a gangbanger named Johns walked into Pete's looking for a guy who snitched on M.
he sprayed the whole place.
six dead including a little girl.
and Serena Medeiros.
he shouldn't even been on the street.
after the guy snitched on him, cops busted him. Didn't stick.
24 hours later, he's back on the street.
north wing's contained. Keep it locked down. - Yes, sir.
police! Don't move! - Don't move!
stay where you are!
have you been shot? - No.
Derek do this to you?
Where'd he go? - How do I know?
so he just tied you up and left you here?
he could've capped me. Just took my phone.
boss, we've contained another subject. His name is Remo Benzina.
Derek's still on the run. He's got Reme' s phone - what's up? - Remo's text message. Check it out.
the message was sent at 6: 42 P. M. And Jules and sam found him at 6: 39 P. M.
he'd already had his phone taken by Derek. - Yeah, yeah.
west basement? Boiler roo west stairs.
I told you what I had to do.
Derek, we know where you are and we're coming there now.
no, no, no, stay, stay away.
Bravo, alpha team, boiler room.
West-most stairs.
Derek, I know what happened to your mom.
then you know why I don't trust cops.
I'm not talking to you as a cop.
I'm not talking to you as a man who wants you to succeed.
and you made a choice to be somebody different.
don't quit. Don't quit on that choice.
don't quit on the guy that you set out to be, who Matt needs you to be, and who your mom would have been so proud of.
you gotta trust yourself, Derek.
you don't want to do this.
no, I don't, but I have to.
you ought to know better.
get down! Get down!
stay down! Stay down! Stay down on the ground!
Sam, Jule, keep him contained!
Eddie, take that catwalk.
who's got a 20?
no joy.
police! Don't move! Don't move!
police! Freeze!
stay down! - Let's see some hands!
hands behind your back! - Stay down!
let's see some hands!
okay. Nice work.
Sam, let's get some medical personnel down here right away.
Hey, Derek.
Mattie, where's mattie?
I need to talk to him.
he's doing okay.
multiple shots fired, west boiler room. Sru on scene.
I need help!
officer, I need a hand. Come over here. I gotta get an iv in.
here, hold him. Pressure. Don't let go.
you did the right thing.
you took care of your brother the best way you could.
I just need to talk to him, let him know I'm all right.
you will. You just stay put. We're gonna have you taken care of first.
Hey, Eddie, let's keep our friend here inside a cruiser.
I'm gonna stay here with Derek. - Copy that.
good man.
whoa, Matt. What are you doing with that gun?
you shot my brother.
Matt, your brother's gonna be okay.
no, I heard about the gunshot. You're lying.
no, he's getting fixed up.
I wouldn't lie to you about that.
no, I gotta finish this now.
Matt, this isn't the way to do it.
Yeah, well, you guys ain't gonna do it.
he's going to jail.
Yeah, yeah, like the guy killed my mom went to jail?
I hear you, Matt. - You don't.
you don't know nothin' about that.
you're right, I don't.
but I do know how it feels when I see these guys out on the street who have no right to be and it makes me mad.
it makes me feel like thing's not safe.
okay, then! So then you know why I gotta do it!
I do. I do, but Matt, listen, in five minutes, your brother Derek had the same choice to make, Matt, and he put the gun down. He put it down.
and I know that he would want you to make the same choice.
you guys made it this far because you stuck together, Matt.
you stuck together. You looked out for each other.
now, Derek's been there for you, Matt.
he's been there for you. Now you gotta be there for him.
Matt, it's okay, Matt.
it's okay. It's okay.
it's okay.
we're gonna get through this, Matt.
I'm not gonna let you down.
I'm not gonna punch out at the end of this shift.
you have nothing to be sorry about.
you have nothing to be sorry about.
okay, no way, no way.
I'm tired. I'm going home.
I'm not doing the Greg Parker review from hell. Simple as that.
what the... - What about the review?
you guys want a review?
how's this?
officers Callaghan Braddock performed admirably in securing assigned areas and gathering key intel without any public displays of affection.
officer Scarlatti's skill in computers and other geeky toys was augmented today by a truly spectacular takedown...
of a dangerous subject.
officer Young provided crucial backup and insight into the psychology of yet another subject.
and officer Wordsworth, well,
thank you.
and that leaves us with officer Ed Lane, who, truth be told, has always been a bit of a problem for team one...
let's have it.
cause when everybody's struggling, he's pushing through.
when everyone's lost, he finds our way.
and when we falter, he picks us up.
the problem is after he's done all that, who picks him up, right?
you saved that kid today, Eddie.
at one time or another, you've saved every person in this room.
Yep.
so, today is Ed Lane's fifth anniversary as team leader.
all right!
cheers to that. - Cheers.
five more years.
Yeah, finally shut him up.
What're you looking at?!
where are you going?
I gotta go in. Re-upped. 10-33.
I don't speak code.
Soph, I gotta go in.
look, not now. Not today, okay? We booked it off, you promised me.
it's an officer down, okay? You know that.
but you promised. You're not the only cop.
I'll try to make it back.
Ed! Not today!
Oh my god!
are you okay?
do you wanna call someone?
are you hurt? Do you need an ambulance?
let me drive you to the hospital.
be careful putting that in. Just...
What're you doing?
wait, don't... Don't, no! Stop!
stay down! - My baby's in there!
my baby's in there!
Yeah. Copper's guns and gangs, undercover.

was he carrying anything besides the gun?
he had a hockey bag. - All right, good.
Hey, boss.

once we get floorplans, we'll get eyes in on the baby, make sure it's okay.
it's a she, Wordy.
I know.
Hello?
11: 24 am, first phone contact.
Hi, my name's sergeant Greg Parker, i'm with the police strategic response unit.
am I talking to bruce?
they wanna know if it's Bruce.
I am.
that's more than one voice.
Jules, may have a second hostage. Find out who the room is registered to.
is this Bruce Demaura?
no.
who am I talking to?
that's right. Yeah, we're gonna talk this out.
Yeah, we're gonna talk this out, right? - He has lots of guns.
Yeah-yeah-yeah, you tell 'em that, that's good.
I'm really scared. - Voice sounds young.
what's your name, son?
Ben. - Ben. Is this your room?
Yes. - Parker initiates contact with second hostage.
can you tell me what happened?
there's a baby in here. - I know, and we're gonna get you both outta there.

room's registered to a benjamin sam.
Ed! Plans!
Thanks, Roy.
break it down.
windows, green wall.
bedroom. Bathroom.
Ah, even if we get eyes in... Ugh.
front door opens the wrong way.
Yeah, it blocks the view of the main room.
can we get a camera under the front door?
that front window leaves us fully exposed.
if he looks past the curtain. - That's a big if.
if we gotta go in hard, we gotta keep that kid and the baby out of the line of fire.
meaning we have to know exactly where they are at all times.
let's do it. - Okay.
I've picked up two different cell signals. The first one's our subject, Bruce Demaura.
the second one's a "Paul Wilder."
the name "Benjamin Sam" doesn't check out. It's not in any database.
Thanks, Winnie.
he lied about his name.
wouldn't be the first time... Fake name, motel.
spike, text "paul wilder" our number.
Jules, you run the name.
look, how many times do I gotta explain this to you, huh?
I'm not interested in making any deals, okay?
this ends right here, right now.
maybe... Maybe you can do that, but you should give them the baby.
you give them the baby, then... You can do what you gotta do.
Yeah, we give 'em the baby, and they think I'm making a deal.
paul Wilder, 17-years-old, father deceased, lives with his mother and sister in parkdale.
that's close. - Yeah, I got his mom en route.
it's five blocks away. What's he doing in a motel, signing under a fake name?
you live with your mother, maybe you have a girlfriend, you need some privacy.
just sayin'.
eyes in 60 seconds. - Eddie, hold on.
got a text from the kid.
says the baby's coming out.
hold up. - He's giving up the baby.
maybe he's ready to talk? - Hope so.
change of plan. Wordy, drop the cam, cover us.
that's it, that's it.
other hand where we can see it, please.
eyes on subject.
you see that?
he's got an automatic, looks like a. 308.
shield might not take a. 308.
he's dragging us into the open.
all right, good.
good, that's nice and slow.
that's it, just set it down.
and back into the room.
back into the room, leave the door open.
we are not gonna do anything else here, okay?
no way. You to get back in here and you close the door.
we're doing this my way!
take the baby, quick. Do it now. - Get back in here!
Paul, I said get back in here!
Paul, now!
Eddie, you okay? - I'm good, I'm good.
armor piercing rounds.
that's it. The gloves are off. Jules, get the arwen.
spike, you cover. We're gonna flush him out with flash bangs and cs gas.
it's okay, sweetheart, you're okay. It's okay.
he gives us a fake name, but that guy knows who he is?
they know each other.
gas masks.
everybody good? - Yeah.
do you guys hear anything?
that's impossible.
Jules, couple more.
okay, masks.
boss...
let's go! Go, go, go!
police!
sru! Police, police! Police!
sru! Police!
let's see some hands! Police!
down on the ground!
we got a subject down! Subject down!
Paul, you can come out now.
hands where I can see them.
bathroom's clear.
bedroom's clear.
well then where is he?
a guy doesn't just disappear.
he's here someplace. Let's tear it apart.
Winnie, we need an emt.
subject's unconscious, he's got a serious head wound.
gunshot?
blunt trauma. - Where's Paul?
boss, he's m.i.a.
come again? - He's here somewhere. We're looking.
well, look harder.
no joy.
the ceiling?
it's a flat roof. - Bathroom window?
no, it's small, it's stuck, there's no way he went that way. - Well, let's make like he did.
get a uniform to confirm east perimeter's secure.
forget that, secure all perimeters.
spike, get back to the truck, let's get a chopper out there. - Copy.
and have Roy talk to the manager, and everything he knows about this motel room and about Paul Wilder.
and I wanna talk to his mom right away.
head wound like that...- Maybe he was pistol-whipped?
I'm Penny Wilder. Is my son in there?
Hi, Mrs. Wilder. I'm Sergeant Parker.
I heard guns. What's going on? Is he all right?
as far as we know, yeah.
they told me he was a hostage.
can you tell me why your son might've been at this hotel today?
uh... No.
what's he doing with all these batteries?
Yeah, well, look at this.
let's get that off to spike.
hip waders?
whoa, whoa, whoa, guys... It's a hidden cupboard.
okay, Paul, come on out.
let's go! Paul!
hold on, let me get the crowbar.
Paul, we're coming in. If you're there, keep your hands where we can see them.
okay, jules, we got a toolbox... - On my way.
we got a computer...
guys, keep your eyes open.
toolbox contains...
cash - Over a hundred dollars, two rolls of duct tape, flash drive.
we got a map of the city.
a highly annotated map of the city.
let me look. - On its way.
hotel manager says Paul's been renting here for three weeks - Cash only.
three weeks. You get that, boss?
occasional nights?
Occasional? - No, consecutive. Paid ahead.
consecutive. Paid ahead.
Mrs. Wilder, has Paul been spending nights away from home?
uh, yeah. He's called a couple of times to say he was crashing with a friend.
was he doing that prior to these past three weeks?
no, but that's a good thing because he's coming out of his shell.
he's quiet. He's sensitive.
he, um... He really cares about his studies, especially if it's a subject he gets into.
like what? - Science.
these days it's cities - How they work.
he skipped two grades - His iq is 137.
near genius.
we prefer "gifted."
I prefer "gifted" myself.
paul have a girlfriend?
no. Why?
we found this in his room. Do you recognize her?
uh, no. I'm sorry, in his room here?
he... He... Has a room here?
I, I don't understand.
he's gone to a lot of trouble, and I'm guessing these aren't bicycle paths.
you see that? - Sunrise motel. He's circled it.
it's connected to a blue line.
blue lines are connected to the streets... - And some of them lead to the lake.
what's he doing with all these batteries?
hip waders?
batteries and hip waders.
guys, he's in the sewers.
those blue lines? He's marked the sewers.
there's an old access point under the motel.
let's go, we're looking for a trap door.
bedroom. Come on, gimme a hand.
Sam, grab that end.
we got it, we got it!
you guys ready? - Yeah.
looks clear.
the blue line you're on, it's a storm sewer, noted beside it 11: 30 am.
my guess is he's waiting for a system flush or factory flush before he could go in.
cause we made entry at... 11: 32.
he played us.
waited 'til he could get away.
spike, get squad cars to all the closest sewer exit points.
we're going in. - Copy
paul was in his motel room ten minutes ago.
he left through a sewer tunnel and he still may be armed.
do you have any idea where he would go?
we got five exit points, and they're all near public places.
you got a library, a mall, a bus station, a rink, and a school.
if he knows we're after him, he's gonna wanna get outta there fast.
spike, get us the closest exit.
go right, you'll be heading north. - Copy.
Hey, boss. Bruce is conscious.
be right there.
how do you know Paul?
look, I just want you to know, that cop this morning?
him getting shot, that was... That was an accident.
sure, an accident.
Yeah, and that kid, you know, he's been asking around.
Really? About what?
a gun.
and he came to you? - Yeah, yeah. Paid half up front.
the other half was today. It was straight up deal.
you know there are easier ways to get guns on the streets. He came to you?
I'm the guy that can get anything.
what was he looking for?
Pug-nose, 44, vintage.
boss, you gotta see this.
Paul's looking for a gun from Bruce. Bruce shows up at his doorstep, bringing the party with him.
paul wasn't counting on that. He was counting on a pug-nose. 44.
flash drive from Paul's toolbox.
photos.
beheadings, vivisection, post-gunshot suicide, etcetera, etcetera.
here we have... Biographies.
Gacy, son of Sam, Dahmer, Ted Bundy.
these are serial killer profiles.
you know the name Paul checked under - Benjamin Sam?
did you know "Ben" is Hebrew for "son of." Son of Sam.
that's "the. 44 killer."
that's the same gun Paul was looking for.
there's more.
five exit points, five photos... - Five victims.
Tracy. That's the girl in the photo we found in Paul's room.
Yeah. Today was her day.
it still might be. Team one, listen up.
we may be dealing with a man with psychopathic tendencies.
looks like he's been working on a plan involving girls he's been stalking.
possible abductions at gunpoint, taking them back to a room with privacy, okay?
there are five possible places he could be right now. We just need to figure out where.
Yeah. If we're not too late.
so today's the beginning of Paul's career as a serial killer?
these guys take a long time to plan their first victim and he picked today for a reason.
he's probably gonna stick to it.
even knowing he's on our radar?
that might not even occur to him, Eddie.
if he's got a psychopath's ego, he's thinking he's outsmarted us.
Yeah, and his brain is desensitized to the threat of punishment.
so what just happened is not gonna stop him.
okay, talk to the mom.
those photos of the five girls?
I've cross-referenced them with the exit points.
four of them were taken indoors - Got a library, school, bus station.
only Tracy's is outdoors, and she's carrying something.
at first, I thought that was like a purse or a knapsack, but now I'm thinking it's laces.
skate laces. - Skating rink.
Yeah. - Call them.
confirm any young women matching that description - Employees, skaters taking lessons.
we're looking for someone who's on a set routine. She'd be there now.
copy.
Hey, Winnie, confirm that unis are set at all five locations.
Eddie, change of plan, go to the rink.
what's going on?
penny, we need to talk.
which way do we go?
spike, we're at a junction here, which way are we going?
Hey, you're gonna wanna go left.
left.
is your son an empathetic person? - empathetic?
Yes, if someone's harmed or in distress, does he feel for them?
he doesn't really respond like other people, but you just have to know him.
how did he respond when your husband died?
he, uh... He didn't.
does your son take pleasure in hurting people?
what? No! God, what-what are you saying?
if anything, people take pleasure in hurting him and-and picking on him.
he's always been the smallest, the youngest, the smartest in his class.
I don't understand. Why are you asking me this?
we think that your son might have psychopathic tendencies.
I'm sorry, what?
has he ever been rejected by a woman with red shoulder-length hair?
scuse us a second.
Jules, come on.
you're pushing too hard.
we don't have time for kid gloves - You saw what was in that toolbox.
I know, but you can't shut her down.
he worships serial killers.
or he studies serial killers.
come on, classic Bundy - He stalks girls that look like the one that rejected him.
Jules, he's seventeen. We can't jump to that conclusion.
Plus, we gotta keep her trust if we're gonna get to the truth.
okay.
so you go to the house, do an environmental profile. I'll keep talking to the mom.
if this comes to a showdown, we need to know everything.
listen to me, please. I know my boy.
I know he's different, he's special, but there's no way he's a psychopath.
sit.
we're not here to judge your son.
we just wanna figure out how we can help him.
can you help me do that?
thank you.
we found some photos on Paul's computer.
Oh my god.
penny? - When you showed me that girl before, I didn't see it.
but look at them, all five of them.
you know them? - Franny. They all look like Franny.
his sister.
ed, if you're first contact, you're gonna need to negotiate.
so we're talking down a psychopath.
a youth with possible psychopathic tendencies until we get more information.
copy that.
he loved Franny, when she was a baby.
he took care of her. She was the whole world to him.
but when she got older...
she got more independent and... She wasn't "his" anymore.
and... And then one day she told him she thought he was scary.
he had a hard time with that. I mean, it's hard.
he's awkward, he's reclusive.
even he knows he doesn't 'get' people.
he knows that? - Yeah. Oh yeah.
I do my best to be a bridge between them, but...
why can't I be with my friends without you? You act like a freak!
I've dealt with you my whole life! You hear me? It's over! It's over!
I never want to see your sick-freak face again!
it was just last year.
he went through every family photo in the house.
he cut Franny's face out of all of them.
he threw all of her things out a window.
he said wanted her to just, to... To go, to disappear.
what did you do? - I made him promise...
never to hurt his sister. I said, do it for me, do it for my sake.
never touch...
Oh my god...
he's keeping his promise to me. He's...
he's going after these girls instead of Franny!
Oh god! This is because of me. This is my fault.
ed, exit point's on your left-hand side.
okay, Sam.
it's Paul.
Ooh, I'm sorry, do I know you?
last week, remember? We talked about how cold it was.
it was cold and um... You know.
right. Yeah.
I need you to come with me.
I'm sorry, I actually have a lesson that I have to get to, so...
no, no. No. You gotta come with me.
let go of me! - I have a gun.
what?
boss, we got him at the rink.
keep quiet! - Help!
stay back!
Paul! My name's Ed Lane, I'm with the sru!
Paul! My name's Ed Lane, I'm with the sru!
I need you to lower that gun, son!
leave me alone!
in position.
okay, here we go... She said,"he's serious about his studies, especially when it's a subject he gets into.
like the sewers, like his sister.
intense, fixated interests.
he prefers to be alone.
she said,"he knows he doesn't 'get' people.
and a psychopath would think he does "get" people, and that he's smarter than them.
Hey, boss, I'm in Paul's bedroom.
how's it look?
orderly would be an understatement.
that's very good. What else?
there's a photo essay, like he's been studying human emotions and behaviours.
what do you see, Jules?
facial expressions, gestures, body language...
Jules, those captions, what do they say?
"you are angry." "You are bored." "You are happy to see me.
sounds like he's trying to learn how to read people.
that's odd. Psychopaths, they know how to do that.
What're you thinking? - Look, I'm not ruling out that he has tendencies, but we might be dealing with some undiagnosed high-functioning autism.
like Asperger's Syndrome?
people with Asperger's, they're not violent, I know that. There's a lot more playing here, but it's a place to start.
january 23rd. That's today.
guys, it's Franny's birthday. That's why he picked today.
we're just here to help you, buddy.
okay?
look, paul... Your mom tells me that you're a real bright kid, so can you just help us out here?!
look, I don't wan to talk to you!
please, Paul, just let me go.
he kept one photo of his sister and he didn't cut her out. It was him and Franny.
was she a baby?
Yeah, I think she was turning about three.
but I thought they didn't get along?
Yeah, well, he kept it because they had a bond back then.
she never rejected him... She never judged him till she got older.
that's when he got angry.
obsessed with the serial killers, the death pictures, the five girls that look like her.
look, maybe he's just trying to... Understand why he's different, why he's alone.
he's done his research, he thinks he's a psychopath, so he's doing it by the book.
if that's the case, we gotta make him look deeper than that.
status, Eddie.
boss, he's agitated, he's unresponsive.
he's focused in here. He's threat yellow.
I'm gonna try a new angle.
Hey, Paul!
how you doing?!
I'm Sergeant Parker. We talked on the phone at the motel. Remember?
nobody is listening to me. I don't want to talk!
okay. I'll talk then.
okay, okay.
you did something really brave today.
you did something really great. Do you know what that was?
no.
you helped a little baby.
and you kept her safe, like you kept Franny safe.
don't talk to me about Franny!
okay okay we don't have to.
but I just want you to know that those people that you've been studying
I mean, let's call them what they are
those killers... Killers...
they wouldn't have...
they wouldn't have helped that baby today.
and Bruce, you could've shot Bruce, you could've crossed that line, but you didn't do that either.
you made the choice to not hurt him.
those killers?
they wouldn't have made that choice.
you're not like them. - No. You don't know me.
well, you're right. I don't know everything about you, but I do know that you work really hard to understand yourself.
I understand myself. I know what I am. It is other people!
I know. I know you like order, you like routine.
it's stressful to be around all these people.
but it's peaceful, but it's peaceful to just focus on just one thing that matters to you, right?
like stuff at school.
like the sewers.
like your baby sister...
she hates me.
Nah, she's scared of you 'cause she didn't understand you.
but, you and I we could help her out with that.
cause I'm thinking you might have this condition.
if I'm right, there are a lot of people who are gonna know exactly what you're going through, and I'll help you find them.
well, how do I know you're not lying?
you think I'm lying to you?
I don't know. I don't...
what do you think lying means? What does that mean to you?
saying a false statement, deceiving or giving a wrong impression.
okay. Then let me ask you something different.
do you think I'm listening to you?
I don't want to hurt her.
I know that. - I don't want to hurt her.
I know. I know. I knew that the minute we started talking.
do you want me to give the gun to you?
if that's what you want.
or you can just put it down on the ground.
okay. Stay where you are, Paul.
no one's gonna hurt you. No one's gonna hurt you.
Yeah. It's okay, son.
Oh god.
what's wrong with me? Why didn't I see this?
honey, you can't blame yourself.
all right, you thought your son was different, you thought he was special, and he is.
Yeah, I should've done something.
you did.
you loved him, and you cannot stop doing that.
you know, he's gonna need help.
there's therapy, there's medication...
most of all, he's gonna need you.
go ahead.
I'm sorry. - No. I'm sorry.
I love you.
let's go, son. Come on. Sorry, ma'am.
it's okay. It's okay.
Yeah.
we got that baby safe.
and you want me to back you up.
the call not to approach the motel, I didn't hear you on the radio.
you didn't?
we were doing the best that we could.
a cop was shot.
we thought there was a baby in there. - I know. Look...
I just don't have time right now.
never did.
undiagnosed low-spectrum autism.
a little obsessive-compulsive.
maybe a borderline personality diisorder.
and a mother who only sees the son she loves... Who's brilliant, but different.
you ever get the feeling we only get to scratch the surface?
all the time.
you know, you were right today though, about digging deeper.
we do what we can with the time we have, right?
Yep.
baby?
I really needed you today. - I'm sorry.
all I ever wanted was for Juli Baker to leave me alone.
it all began in the summer of 1957, before the start of second grade.
here we are.
what do you guys think? I like this place.
it's cool. Uh, what color is my room?
just you wait.
let's see what's inside. Hey, come on, buddy Bryce.
why don't, uh, you and I go help unload the van and the womenfolk here can get in the kitchen and start setting up.
okay, Dad.
for me, it was the beginning of what would be more than half a decade of strategic avoidance and social discomfort.
Hi, I'm Juli Baker. Hey, hey, what are you doing?
don't you want some help?
no. There's some valuable things in there.
how about this one? No, no, no.
run home. Your mother's probably wondering where you are.
Oh, no, my mom knows where I am. She said it's fine.
it didn't take long to realize this girl could not take a hint.
it's crowded in here with three people. I don't mind.
of any kind. You wanna push this one together?
Bryce, isn't it time for you to go help your mother?
Oh, yeah.
I mean, nothing would stop her.
I was about to tell her to get lost when the weirdest thing happened.
I couldn't believe it.
there I was holding hands with this strange girl.
how did I get into this mess? Well, hello.
I see you've met my son
finally, I did the only manly thing available when you're 7 years old.
however, my troubles were far from over.
the minute I walked into Miss Yelson's classroom
Bryce? You're here.
it was clear:
school would not be a sanctuary.
Hey, Bryce, where's your girlfriend?
I was branded for life.
Hey, Bryce, why don't you ask her to marry you?
Bryce and Juli sitting in a tree
K-l-S-S-l-N-G
my first year in town was a disaster.
look at them.
and the next three weren't much better.
but finally, in the sixth grade, I took action.
I hatched the plan.
sherry.
sherry, wait up.
Hi, Bryce. Heh.
I asked out Sherry Stalls.
I was wondering if you wanted to go
to full appreciate the brilliance of this plan you have to understand that Juli hated Sherry Stalls though I never understood why.
sherry was nice, friendly and she had a lot of hair.
at first, my mother wouldn't let me get my ears pierced, but I begged
the idea was that Sherry would eat with me maybe we'd walk around together, and hopefully Juli would lose interest.
but I still can't get the hoops till I'm 16.
Oh, that's a shame.
so Melanie wanted to get her ears pierced, but of course her mother said no.
so she threw a fit and smashed her Johnny Mathis Greatest Hits album and she got grounded, so now she can't come to my pajama sleepover party.
things were unfolding quite nicely.
what are you doing for your science project?
that is, until my supposed best friend, Garrett Einbinder took an interest in Sherry himself.
I was thinking of showing how split ends react with different hair conditioners.
that's fascinating.
loyalty gave way to desire and Garrett, the turncoat told Sherry what I was up to.
jerk.
she didn't take it well.
word got back to Juli, and pretty soon she started up with the goo-goo eyes again.
only this time it was worse.
she started sniffing me.
that's right, sniffing me.
what was that all about?
my only consolation was that next year would be different.
junior high, bigger school.
maybe we'd be in different classes and it would finally, finally be over.
the first day I met Bryce Loski, I flipped.
it was those eyes, something in those dazzling eyes.
you wanna push this one together?
his family had just moved into the neighborhood and I'd gone over to help them.
I'd been in the van all of two minutes when his dad sent him off to help his mom.
I could see he didn't wanna go.
so I chased after him to see if we could play a little before he got trapped inside.
the next thing I know, he's holding my hand and looking right into my eyes.
my heart stopped.
was this it?
would this be my first kiss?
but then his mother came out. Well, hello.
and he was so embarrassed, his cheeks turned completely red.
I went to bed that night thinking of the kiss that might have been.
I mean, it was clear he had feelings for me, but he was just too shy to show them.
my mother said boys were like that.
so I decided to help him out.
Bryce? You're here.
I would give him plenty of opportunity to get over his shyness.
by the sixth grade, I'd learned to control myself.
then Sherry Stalls entered the picture.
sherry Stalls was nothing but a whiny, gossipy, backstabbing flirt.
all hair and no substance.
and there she was holding hands with Bryce. My Bryce.
the one who was walking around with my first kiss.
my solution was to ignore her. I knew a boy of Bryce's caliber would eventually see through a shallow conniver like Sherry Stalls.
it took all of a week. They broke up at recess.
she didn't take it well.
now that Bryce was out of Sherry's evil clutches, he started being nicer to me.
Hi, Juli. Hi, Bryce.
he was so shy and so cute and his hair, it smelled like watermelon.
I couldn't get enough of it.
I spent the whole year secretly sniffing watermelon and wondering if I was ever going to get my kiss.
seventh grade brought changes, all right.
but the biggest one didn't happen at school.
it happened at home.
my grandfather came to live with us.
mom said he stared like that because he missed Grandma.
that was not something Grandpa would ever talk about with me.
as a matter of fact, he never talked about much of anything with me.
that is, until Juli appeared in the local newspaper.
Oh, Bryce. May I speak with you? What?
have a seat, son.
tell me about your friend Juli Baker.
Juli. She's not exactly my friend.
Oh. Why's that?
why do you wanna know?
now, Juli Baker did not wind up in The Mayfield Times for being an eighth-grade Einstein.
no, she got front-page coverage because she refused to climb out of a sycamore tree.
Juli Baker and that stupid sycamore tree.
she always thought it was God's gift to our little corner of the universe.
Hey, Bryce. Wanna come climb the tree with me and my brothers?
no, thanks.
Bryce. Come up here. It's fun.
you can see everything. I can't.
my dad needs me to help him fix a thing.
that's all I needed.
climb up a tree with Juli Baker.
I'd be dragged right back into the second grade.
Bryce and Juli sitting in a tree.
why don't you just make me eat lima beans for the rest of my life.
it's three blocks away.
two blocks.
one block away.
like that's valuable information. I hate it when she does that.
I like to think there's at least a chance the bus won't show.
I think the tree looks particularly beautiful in this light. Don't you?
if by "beautiful" you mean "unbelievably ugly,"
then, yes, I would agree.
you're just visually challenged. I feel sorry for you.
"visually challenged"?
"visually challenged"?
this from the girl who lived in a house that was the joke of the neighborhood?
they had bushes growing over windows and weeds all over the place.
it bugged my dad bigtime.
Oh, there he is.
the bricklayer who thinks he's a painter.
that truck's not ugly enough in real life?
he's gotta make a painting of it?
no, he does landscapes. Sells them at the county fair.
people say they're beautiful.
landscapes? Let me tell you something.
the world would have more beauty in it if he'd do a little landscaping on that piece of crap he calls a yard.
I feel bad for his wife. She married a dreamer.
because of that, one of the two of them will always be unhappy.
Yeah, fine. But why do we have to be unhappy?
as annoying as the yard was to my dad it was nothing compared to how annoying Juli Baker was in that tree.
three blocks away.
every morning we had to listen to the sound of her blow-by-blow traffic report.
two blocks.
there you go.
why do they call it The Three Stooges?
I mean, there's five of them. What?
well, yeah, there's Moe, Larry, Curly, Shemp and Curly Joe.
Yeah, but they only have three at a time. Yeah.
you know, I hate Curly Joe. I mean, he shouldn't even be a Stooge.
listen, girl, I'm this close to calling the police.
you are trespassing and obstructing progress on a contracted job.
what's going on? Either you come down or we're gonna cut you down. You guys, come up here with me.
they won't cut it down if we're all up here.
bus, bus, bus. Juli was frantic.
they wanted to cut down her tree.
I couldn't understand why that mutant tangle of gnarly branches meant so much to her. Bryce, please.
I felt bad for her. Leave her.
but I wasn't about to cut school over it.
come on, bro.
why isn't she your friend, Bryce?
you'd have to know Juli.
well, I'd like to.
Why?
that girl has an iron backbone.
why don't you invite her over sometime?
an iron backbone?
she's just stubborn and she's pushy beyond belief.
is that so?
and she's been stalking me since the second grade.
well, a girl like that doesn't live next door to everyone.
lucky them.
read this.
without prejudice.
like I needed to know anything more about Juli Baker.
Juli wasn't at the bus stop the next morning.
or the morning after that.
she was at school, but you'd never know it.
little Joe? He's got so much makeup on. He doesn't age.
I told myself I should be glad about it.
I mean, isn't that what I'd always wanted?
but still, I felt bad for her.
I was gonna tell her I was sorry, but then I thought, hey, no that's the last thing I needed:
Juli Baker thinking I missed her.
I see why you like to come out here.
would you mind explaining it to your mother?
I loved to watch my father paint.
or really, I loved to hear him talk while he painted.
I learned a lot about my dad that way.
he told me all sorts of things like how he got his first job delivering hay and how he'd wished he'd finished college.
then one day he surprised me.
what's going on with you and, uh, Bryce Loski?
what do you mean? Nothing.
Oh, okay.
my mistake.
why would you even think that?
no reason.
just that you talk about him all the time.
I do?
I don't know.
I guess it's something about his eyes.
or maybe his smile.
but what about him?
what? You have to look at the whole landscape.
what does that mean?
a painting is more than the sum of its parts.
a cow by itself is just a cow.
a meadow by itself is just grass, flowers.
and the sun peeking through the trees is just a beam of light.
but you put them all together and it can be magic.
I didn't really understand what he was saying until one afternoon when I was up in the sycamore tree.
I was rescuing a kite.
it was a long way up, higher than I'd ever been.
and the higher I got, the more amazed I was by the view.
I began to notice how wonderful the breeze smelled.
like sunshine and wild grass.
I couldn't stop breathing it in filling my lungs with the sweetest smell I'd ever known.
Hey, you found my kite.
Bryce, you should come up here.
it's so beautiful.
I can't. I sprained my, um
I have a rash.
from that moment on, that became my spot.
I could sit there for hours, just looking out at the world.
some days the sunsets would be purple and pink.
and some days they were a blazing orange setting fire to the clouds on the horizon.
it was during one of those sunsets that my father's idea of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts moved from my head to my heart.
some days I would get there extra early to watch the sunrise.
one morning I was making mental notes of how the streaks of light were cutting through the clouds so I could tell my dad when I heard a noise below.
excuse me.
excuse me. I'm sorry, but you can't park there. That's a bus stop.
Hey, what are you doing up there?
you can't be up there, we're gonna take this thing down.
the tree? Yeah. Now come on down.
but who told you, you could cut it down? The owner.
Why?
he's gonna build a house, and this tree's in the way.
so come on, girl, we got work to do.
you can't cut it down. You just can't.
listen, girl. I'm this close to calling the police.
you are trespassing and obstructing progress on a contracted job.
now either you come down, or we're gonna cut you down.
go ahead. Cut me down.
I'm not coming down. I'm never coming down.
Bryce. You guys, come up here with me.
they won't cut it down if we're all up here.
Bryce, please don't let them do this.
come on, you guys.
Bryce, please. You don't have to come up this high. Just a little ways.
Bryce, please. Please.
what happened after that was a blur.
it seemed like the whole town was there.
but still I wouldn't move.
then my father showed up.
he talked a fireman into letting him come up to where I was.
sweetie, it's time to come down.
daddy, please don't let them do this.
sweetie. Daddy, look.
you can see everything. You can see the whole world from here.
no view is worth my daughter's safety. Now, come on.
I can't.
Julianna, it's time to come down now.
please, Daddy.
it's time.
and that was it.
I must've cried for two weeks straight.
Oh, sure, I went to school and did the best I could but nothing seemed to matter.
Juli? Huh?
do you know the answer?
uh, the Peloponnesian War?
I'm sure that's the answer to something but I was looking for the area of a rhomboid.
somehow, rhomboids and isosceles right triangles didn't seem so important.
I rode my bike so I wouldn't have to pass by the stump that used to be the earth's most magnificent sycamore tree.
but no matter what I did, I couldn't stop thinking about it.
are you okay?
it was just a tree.
no, it wasn't just a tree.
I never want you to forget how you felt when you were up there.
Thanks, Dad.
it was the first thing I saw every morning and the last thing I saw before I went to sleep.
and once I could look at it without crying
I saw more than the tree and what being up there meant to me.
I saw the day that my view of things around me started changing.
and I wondered, did I still feel the same things about Bryce?
I've never been a huge fan of eggs.
I mean, I could always just take them or leave them.
that is, until one day in Skyler Brown's garage when my feelings about eggs were solidified.
Hey, hey, hey. Guys. Edna's found her breakfast.
I mean, if a slimy reptile found them appetizing there was certainly no place for them in my diet.
Oh, man, that's so cool.
she doesn't even have to chew. I mean, think of all the time you'd save.
I could've gone my whole life not knowing that snakes eat eggs raw if it hadn't been for Lynetta.
she had a major-league thing for Skyler Brown.
I think it's gross.
he and Juli's brothers, Matt and Mark, had formed a band.
and Lynetta would watch them practice.
that is so neat.
how about that, huh, Bryce?
Yeah. Neat.
so, Brycie, how do you think he's gonna digest that?
stomach acid? You'd like to think that.
wait, everybody quiet. Here he goes.
eggs over easy.
gross. Gross, gross, gross.
wait, wait. You haven't seen the best part.
gross.
I tried to be casual about it, but it didn't take.
I started having bad dreams.
I'd be trapped inside a huge egg and this monster would open his jaws and start to devour me.
I'd wake up just in time.
then the real nightmare began.
Hi, Bryce. I brought these over for you and your family.
my chickens are laying eggs. What?
you remember Abby and Bonnie and Clyde and Dexter and Eunice and Florence?
the ones I hatched for the science fair. How could I forget?
it was classic Juli Baker.
she totally dominated the fair.
and get this, her project was all about watching boring eggs hatch.
I mean, here I had a live-action erupting volcano and all anyone cared about was Juli's boring chicks breaking out of their boring shells.
Oh, I think the last one's hatching.
it's hatching. Oh, it's hatching.
kids, come over here.
but hey, she won. I lost.
I've never been one to dwell.
here it comes.
but that didn't mean I had to eat her lousy eggs.
I think it was very sweet of Juli to bring us those eggs.
I don't care. I'm still having cereal tomorrow.
Yeah, how do we know there's no chicks in one of those eggs?
I used to eat farm-fresh eggs when I was a kid. They were delicious.
Yeah, well, that's all well and good but what if we crack one open and a dead chick falls out?
do they have a rooster?
if they don't have a rooster the eggs can't be fertile.
and if they had a rooster, we'd know.
the whole neighborhood would know.
maybe they got it de-yodeled.
"De-yodeled"?
you know. De-cock-a-doodle-doo'd.
what the hell are you talking about?
like they de-bark dogs.
Bryce, why don't you just ask Juli?
I don't think that. What?
you afraid to talk to her? I'm not afraid to talk to her.
I know you are, but what am I?
okay. Just talk to her and find out. Bryce.
how do you tell if one's a rooster?
well, a rooster's bigger. Longer feathers.
they've got that red stuff growing out of their head.
and around their neck too. That shouldn't be too hard to spot.
although, come to think of it, chickens have the rubbery red stuff too.
just not as much.
Garrett's expertise in roosters was the cornerstone of our plan to avoid contact with Juli Baker.
the balance of which involved spying over her back fence.
come on, come on. Shh. Shh.
over here.
I can't see the stupid chickens.
we gotta get them out of the coop.
is that a rooster?
no, it looks like a chicken.
how can you tell?
it just does.
see what I mean? Expertise.
shh, shh! What?
Juli.
here, guys.
go on, there you go.
here, guys. Go on. Yeah, they're all chickens.
there's no rooster? What did I just say?
how can you tell?
well, none of them are strutting. Here, come on.
roosters strut? Come on, guys.
what did I just say? Here.
Plus, hardly any of them have any rubbery red stuff.
what are you doing? Yeah. They're definitely all chickens.
they're all chickens.
I'm proud of you, Bryce.
you overcame your fear. Huh?
you talked to her. Oh, heh. Yeah.
it's no big deal.
that's what she told you? They're all chickens?
Yeah.
she's a genius. You're both genius Of course they're all chickens.
a rooster's a chicken. The question is:
is one of them a rooster or are they all hens?
hens? Who said anything about hens?
then it hit me.
Garrett didn't know jack shit about chickens.
do roosters strut? Yes, they do.
what does that have to do with anything?
they're all hens.
well, the main thing is the eggs are okay.
it's all settled.
not for me.
there was no way I was ever gonna eat anything that had anything to do with Juli Baker.
I'm not eating them.
well, why not?
have you seen their yard?
there's not even any grass. It's all mud and chicken turds.
EW. Gross. Salmonella.
do you suppose they could have salmonella?
it's not very likely. Why take the risk?
what do we do with the eggs?
give them back.
give them back? To Juli? Sure.
you talked to her before, right? It didn't kill you.
well, what do I say?
tell her we don't eat eggs.
uh, we're allergic to them or something.
come on, use your brains.
it didn't feel right to lie.
besides, even a seventh grader would know that entire families aren't allergic to eggs.
but I didn't wanna hurt her feelings either.
so that left me with only one option.
and thus another near-death experience in my ongoing saga with Juli Baker had been successfully avoided.
until one week later.
Hi, Bryce. Brought you some more eggs.
Wow.
Thanks. Did your family like the first batch?
do you even have to ask?
great. See you at school.
what I hoped would be a one-time event was just the beginning of a life consumed with lies, intrigue and deception.
every morning I'd be on the lookout for Juli so if she happened to come,
I could whip the door open before she knocked.
Thanks.
then I'd dump the eggs before anyone noticed.
and why? Why couldn't I just face her?
why couldn't I just say:
no, thanks. Don't want them. Don't need them. Give them to the snake?
was I really afraid of hurting her feelings or was I just afraid of her?
now, you wanna make sure you get it
when Mrs. Brubeck first suggested hatching eggs as my science project
I was less than excited.
that is, until I saw my first sign of life.
is that it?
that's the embryo. Heh. Wow.
it looks like a bean. It does.
let's try the other ones.
suddenly it felt real.
all the eggs were alive.
there were, like, little bean babies inside every one.
on the day of the fair, all six chicks hatched.
what are the odds?
this year's top prize goes to Juli Baker for her wonderful project:
a Chicken is Born.
I won first place.
and that was cool, but all I really cared about were my chicks.
there you go. There you go, guys.
my mom wasn't crazy about us raising chickens.
but I begged and pleaded.
I told her I would take care of everything. And I did.
Where's Clyde?
Clyde?
Hey, Clyde. What's the matter?
are you okay? Aren't you hungry?
come on. Come here. What's wrong, baby?
come here.
Hey, you're not Clyde. You're Clydette.
mom!
as it turned out, my hens laid more eggs than we could eat.
at first we tried to keep up but after a month of boiling, frying and deviling like that movie The Blob, we were being overtaken by eggs.
then opportunity in the form of our neighbor, Mrs. Steuby, knocked.
Hello, dear.
if you ever have any extra, I'd be happy to buy them from you.
Really? Certainly.
and I happen to know that Mrs. Helms would be interested as well.
great. Nothing like fresh eggs.
Thanks, Mrs. Steuby. You bet, dear. Bye.
between Mrs. Steuby and Mrs. Helms, my egg overflow problem was solved.
then I realized that Mrs. Loski deserved eggs too.
but I didn't think it would be right to charge her.
she had been such a good neighbor, lending us supplies when we ran out giving my mother a ride when our car wouldn't start it was the least I could do.
besides, if I happened to run into Bryce, that wouldn't be the end of the world.
Hi, Bryce.
by the third time I brought eggs over to the Loskis
I realized Bryce was waiting for me.
waiting to pull open the door and say, "Thanks, Juli. See you at school."
and in return, I got a few moments alone with the world's most dazzling eyes.
Thanks, Juli. See you at school.
it was a bargain.
until the day it wasn't.
it was two weeks after the sycamore tree was cut down and I was just starting to feel normal again.
Hey, Juli. Right on schedule.
Yeah, well, neither rain nor sleet.
huh? You know, the mailman thing?
Oh. Right.
so, um, will you start riding the bus again?
I don't know. I haven't been up there since
it doesn't look so bad anymore. It's all cleared away.
well, um, I better get ready for school.
guess I'll see you there.
see you.
maybe Bryce was right.
maybe it was time I started riding the bus again.
after all, didn't he just tell me he wanted me to?
could it be that Bryce Loski actually misses me?
Juli? What are you still doing here?
I was just thinking.
it's pickup day. The cans are in front.
I know. You need some help?
no. Maybe I'll do it later.
are those my eggs?
Yeah. Yeah, I dropped them.
they're not broken.
why are you throwing them away?
don't you want them?
it wasn't me. My dad didn't think it was worth the risk.
risk? What risk?
salmonella.
what? He's afraid of being poisoned?
well, Juli, I mean, look at your back yard. It's a complete mess.
it's, like, covered in turds.
that's not true. I clean up after my girls every day.
we just didn't wanna hurt your feelings.
have you always thrown them away?
you know, Mrs. Steuby and Mrs. Helms pay me for my eggs.
they do? They pay me 60 cents a dozen.
I didn't know.
how could you?
I'm sorry.
no, you're not.
it didn't take me long to realize that I'd traded in my old problems with Juli Baker for a whole set of new ones.
it was actually worse having her mad at me than having her annoy me.
the way she ignored me was a constant reminder that I'd been a jerk.
then one day I was coming home from playing basketball with Garrett and things got weird.
don't be so timid. Come on, you won't hurt them.
like this? Yeah, that's it.
my grandfather.
all I ever saw him wear was slippers.
now, where did he get those work boots?
I couldn't stop looking over there.
and the more I looked, the madder I got.
my grandfather had already said more to Juli in one hour than he'd said to me in the whole time he'd been living with us.
I was pretty sure I'd never seen him laugh.
and what was his deal with Juli Baker?
Hi, Grandpa.
Juli told me about the eggs.
you know, Bryce one's character is set at an early age.
I'd hate to see you swim out so far you can't swim back.
sir?
it's about honesty, son.
sometimes a little discomfort in the beginning can save a whole lot of pain down the road.
when it came to holding a grudge, Juli Baker was truly impressive.
all week I tried to approach her at school.
she'd always find some way to duck me.
and whenever she was in her yard, Grandpa was always there with her.
finally, one Saturday I saw my opening.
my grandfather had gone into town to buy some Bengay.
I guess the yard work was starting to get to him.
it's looking real good.
Thanks. Chet did most of it.
I'm sorry for what I did.
I just don't get it, Bryce. Why didn't you just tell me?
I don't know. It was dumb.
and I shouldn't have said anything about your yard, either.
it wasn't right.
maybe it's all for the best.
I mean, look, I learned so much from Chet, it's amazing.
you're lucky.
I don't even have grandparents anymore.
I feel sorry for him.
he misses your grandma.
can you believe it? He says I remind him of her.
what? I know. That's what I said.
but he meant it in a nice way. Something about her spirit.
Yeah.
good luck with the grass. I'm sure it'll come up great.
Thanks.
I guess I'll see you around.
I guess so.
while Juli's acceptance of my apology was not all that I'd hoped for at least the eggs thing was finally behind me.
the first time in months I could truly enjoy Bonanza.
where you going and why you dressed like that?
Skyler's.
Matt and Mark are bringing over recording stuff and they're gonna make a demo.
demo? Like they know how to make a demo.
you don't even know them.
I don't have to. I know the type.
you don't know anything. Don't talk to me like that.
I'm late. Be back by 11.
Yep. Everything was back to normal.
is that girl working you too hard?
that girl's name is Juli. And, no, she isn't working me too hard.
you've developed quite a soft spot for her, huh?
Steven.
no, Patsy. Just wanna find out why your father has the energy to befriend a complete stranger when he won't throw a baseball around with his own grandson.
it's okay, Dad. No, it's not okay.
Juli reminds him of Grandma.
of Renee? Heh.
that's ridiculous.
you know why the Bakers haven't fixed their yard?
Yeah, because he's too busy with his paint-by-numbers kit.
if you had a brother with a severe handicap, what would you do?
what the hell does that have to do with anything?
Juli's father has a retarded brother.
so what? He's not the gardener, is he? Heh.
Steven.
it was a joke.
you know, other people have family troubles and they manage to mow their own lawns.
I don't know where their pride in ownership is.
they don't own that house.
the landlord's supposed to maintain it.
Mr. Baker puts every extra penny he has into caring for his brother.
don't they have government facilities for that sort of thing?
maybe they thought that a private facility would be better for him.
either way, it's not our fault that their family has some chromosomal abnormality.
it has nothing to do with chromosomes.
when Juli's uncle was born, he had the umbilical cord wrapped around his neck.
if he'd had enough oxygen, he would've been a perfect little baby, just like your son.
goddamn it, Chet.
patsy? Patsy? Leave me alone!
sorry about that.
why is Mom so upset?
because but for the grace of God your mother could be standing in Mr. Baker's shoes.
did her brother have the cord wrapped around his neck too?
you did.
luckily, the doctor who delivered you was on the ball and got it untangled but it easily could've gone the other way.
wanna go for a walk? Huh?
I find it helps clear the mind.
what would they have done with me?
you can't dwell on something that might've been, Bryce.
the way my dad was talking, sounds like he would've thrown me in a nuthouse.
no, no. Now, that's not fair.
you can't condemn him for something he hasn't done.
this is where that tree was, wasn't it?
Yeah.
must've been a spectacular view.
she's quite a girl.
some of us get dipped in flat some in satin some in gloss.
but every once in a while you find someone who's iridescent.
and when you do nothing will ever compare.
flat, glossy, iridescent?
what the hell did that mean?
Juli Baker had always just seemed plain to me.
until now.
and the way she talked about what it felt like to be up in that tree to be held above the earth, brushed by the wind.
who in junior high talks like that?
this weird feeling started taking over in the pit of my stomach and I didn't like it.
I was slipping, man.
and it was time to get a grip.
I'd never been embarrassed by where we lived before.
I also never really thought about money.
I knew we weren't rich, but I didn't feel like we were missing anything.
that is, until Bryce Loski called our home a complete mess.
what's your name? What's your name?
is it Mary or Sue?
what's your name?
do I stand a chance with you?
it's so hard to find a personality with charms like yours for me
I had to do something and I knew what it was.
what's your name?
Oh, you're sounding really good.
we'll record it in Skyler's garage.
that's a wonderful project.
speaking of projects,
I was thinking it might be cool to fix up the yard.
what? I mean, how much can grass seed cost?
I could plant a lawn, maybe some flowers.
I could even put up a fence.
honey, that's a major undertaking.
I could pay for it with my egg money.
no. That's your money.
the landlord should be the one taking care of all this.
but he doesn't. And we live here.
and it looks so bad.
Jules.
what's going on?
nothing, Dad.
it's okay, sweetheart.
you can tell us.
the Loskis have been throwing away my eggs because they're afraid of salmonella.
because our yard is such a mess.
did Patsy say that?
no. Bryce did.
but it must have been a family discussion.
a boy doesn't come up with that on his own.
who cares what they think?
Yeah, who cares?
I care.Trina.
let's not get into this.
no, I'm tired of living like this, Richard.
I'm tired of having to take temp jobs just to make ends meet.
I'm tired of having to push a chair up against the washing machine just to keep the door shut.
I'm tired of having to borrow Mrs. Steuby's vacuum cleaner every time ours breaks down.
do you think this is the life I pictured for us?
sometimes you have to sacrifice to do the right thing.
we always end up agreeing that Devonhurst is the right thing for Daniel.
well, maybe we should start thinking about what's right for us.
our daughter is suffering because we won't fix up our own yard.
it's not our yard.
how can you say that, Richard? How?
we've lived here for 12 years and for 12 years we've been saying it's temporary, but it's not.
this is our home.
is it wrong to wanna live somewhere you can be proud of?
to have enough to send your kids to college?
maybe it's time we considered government care.
we are not moving my brother.
he's more important than your own children?
dad! How dare you!
stop it, Dad! Please, just stop.
I'm sorry. Julianna, this is not your fault.
we'll work this out, I promise.
that was the first time
I ever heard my parents really yell at each other.
I'm sorry about tonight.
that night they each came into my room.
my father talked about his brother and how much he loved him and how he promised his parents he'd always take care of him.
my mother talked about how much she loved my father for his strength and kind heart.
when she kissed me good night she whispered that of all her many blessings, I was her best.
I felt sorry for my father.
I felt sorry for my mother.
but most of all, I felt lucky for me that they were mine.
I wanted to think the reason I started working on my yard had nothing to do with Bryce.
it was about making our house better.
after what he did with the eggs, why should I care what he thought?
but I did.
are you pruning that or trying to hack it to death?
Hi. I'm Chet Duncan, Bryce's grandfather.
sorry it's taken me so long to come over and introduce myself.
nice to meet you.
so are you trimming all these to the same height?
well, yeah, that's what I was thinking, but I don't know.
do you think it would look better to take them out?
Oh, these are Hicksii shrubs. These will prune up nicely.
listen, Mr. Duncan.
call me Chet.
Chet.
if you're here because of what Bryce said
I don't need your help.
read about you in the paper.
Renee would've sat up in that tree with you.
she would've sat up there all night.
Renee?
my wife.
you remind me a lot of her.
we worked on the yard for weeks.
and the whole time we worked, we talked.
right there? Perfect, yeah.
he wanted to know more about the sycamore tree.
he knew exactly what it meant about the whole being greater than the sum of its parts.
he said it was the same with people but sometimes with people, the whole could be less.
I thought that was pretty interesting.
I started looking at people I'd known since elementary school trying to figure out if they were more or less than the sum of their parts.
Chet was right. A lot of them were less.
of all my classmates, the one person I couldn't seem to place was Bryce.
until recently, I would've said with absolute certainty that he was greater, far greater, than the sum of his parts.
but now I wasn't so sure.
it's looking good, Juli. Nice job.
Thanks. Chet did most of it.
I'm sorry for what I did.
I just don't get it, Bryce.
why didn't you just tell me?
was he really sorry?
or was he just saying these things to make himself feel better?
then I thought maybe I just wanted him to be more than the sum of his parts.
but as I looked into his eyes those dazzling eyes for the first time
I was pretty sure that Bryce Loski was less.
we're going to invite the Bakers over for dinner.
what? I don't know, Mom.
I think that's a marvelous idea.
patsy, what purpose does this serve?
Trina Baker is a very nice person.
and Matt and Mark are really cool. I hate cool.
something we should've done years ago.
Yeah, but we didn't. And now we can't.
the statute of limitations has run out.
we're having the Bakers over for dinner.
if this is about what I said last night, I'm sorry, okay?
but, you know, having them over for dinner is not gonna fix his brother.
it's going to be a sit-down dinner.
and I expect everyone to dress accordingly.
Oh, God. Can't we just have a barbecue?
it's going to be a sit-down dinner.
just shoot me now.
careful what you wish for.
so that was it.
a dress-up, sit-down dinner with Juli Baker was in my immediate future.
and that made seeing Juli at school more uncomfortable.
I found myself staring at her in class.
and the way her hair fell back over her shoulders she looked just like the picture in the newspaper.
Dana Tressler caught me watching.
if I didn't do something fast, this could spread like wildfire.
there was a bee in her hair.
see, there it goes.
there's no bee.
it flew out the window.
I convinced myself I'd dodged a bullet.
I had to put Juli out of my mind.
keep the focus on the important stuff like schoolwork.
my weakness was unnerving.
I need your sharpener.
you ever heard of knocking?
Hey, what you got there? Dad's Playboy?
none of your business.
give my best to Miss October. Get out.
or should I say your best? Ha, ha. You're disgusting.
another disaster avoided.
my life had become a minefield.
Hey, man. Hey.
what's this?
it's not what you think.
okay, it is what you think, but I can explain.
okay, I can't explain. Can we just talk about it later?
whatever you say.
I had to talk to someone.
why not Garrett? Maybe he could help me get back on track.
Garrett was surprisingly sensitive in matters of the heart.
are you freaking mental? Juli Baker. You hate her.
that's what's weird. I don't think I do.
I can't stop thinking about her.
you got it bad, man. Well, what do I do?
well, you gotta nip this in the bud. These aren't real emotions.
they're not?
you feel guilty because of the egg thing.
Yeah, and I insulted her yard.
exactly. Of course, the place is a dump anyways.
it's not her fault. Her dad's got a retarded brother and all their money goes to helping him.
a retard? Well, shoot, that ought to tell you something.
about what? About Juli.
what are you saying?
the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
I couldn't believe it. I wanted to yell at him.
tell him that he didn't know Juli like I did.
but all that came out was:
heh, oh.
right. Yeah.
right. Um, I'll talk to you later.
I was supposed to go to Garrett's after school but I couldn't be around him.
he'd crossed the line.
and standing right next to him across that line was my father.
I didn't care what they thought.
I liked Juli Baker.
Sunday mornings are peaceful in our house.
my dad lets himself sleep in.
my mother lets herself not fix breakfast.
if my brothers have been out late playing with their band you won't even know they're around till noon.
but this Sunday, I woke up feeling weird.
I had to do something to shake off the confused feelings about Bryce that were starting to creep back in.
you really did it, didn't you? Heh.
proud of you. Thanks, Dad.
where you going? To see Daniel. It's his birthday.
I wanna come with you.
Oh, honey, just enjoy the morning, stay with your mom.
no, Dad. I wanna come.
sweetheart, listen.
sometimes, with Daniel...
I'm coming, Dad.
okay.
we'd better leave a note for your mother.
in all the years, I'd never visited my Uncle Daniel.
I don't know why. It was always something my dad did alone.
we didn't say much to each other on the drive to Devonhurst, but I didn't care.
I just liked being with my dad.
somehow the silence seemed to connect us in a way that words never could.
the residents tend to the grounds as part of their therapy.
it takes some getting used to. They're good people, though.
Daniel?
Daniel.
Richard! You're here!
richard for my birthday.
who? Richard, who? Who?
who? Who? Richard, who? Who?
Daniel, Daniel, it's Julianna. It's my daughter.
your niece.
Julianna.
ha, Julianna. Happy birthday, Uncle Daniel.
Ha-ha-ha. Richard. It's my birthday.
I have your pictures, Julianna. I have your pictures.
we have a present for you.
a puzzle? A puzzle, Richard?
not just a puzzle.
a puzzle and a pinwheel.
a pinwheel! Thank you, Richard.
Yes.
orange. Outside? Outside, Richard?
you wanna go outside? All right, we'll go to, uh, McEIliot's.
we'll walk out there for an ice cream. Ice cream!
Oh, no. No, no, we can't.
Daniel doesn't like ice cream.
I do like ice cream, Richard. I'm only kidding.
I know you like ice cream. Ahh!
you love ice cream. All right, come on.
here you go. Got it? Ah!
here you go.
it's my birthday.
lollipop. It's my birthday.
you like it? Oh!
all right, Daniel. Okay, wait, wait. Ice cream. Ice cream.
my ice cream. My ice cream. Ugh! It's okay. Daniel.
Daniel!
Daniel! Leave it, I'll get y...
ice cream on the floor. Ice cream on the floor.
would you go get him another cone?
Yeah. I need ice cream, Richard!
it's my birthday, Richard. It's my birthday!
ice cream, Richard! Ice cream, Richard!
stop! Stop it!
I need it! Stop it! Stop it!
here we go. Ice cream!
Richard! Okay, okay. I've got some ice cream.
birthday ice cream. That's good, Richard.
I'm so sorry. He hasn't done anything like that
I'd often heard my father talk about how difficult life was for Daniel.
but I never really understood it until now.
Yeah, there you go. Heh. Orange.
on the walk back, Daniel acted like nothing had happened.
other way. Other way.
on the ride home, my dad told me that Uncle Daniel used to live with him and Mom before we were born.
but after a while, it became too difficult.
when we got home, everything looked the same.
but it wasn't.
before today, Daniel had always been just a name to me.
now he was part of the family.
Hey. Hey.
how'd it go?
I'm glad I went.
I'm glad you went too.
Trina, it's Sunday. What are you doing mopping the floor?
Patty Loski invited us over for dinner Friday night.
shouldn't she be mopping her floor?
or did she ask to borrow ours?
nervous energy.
did she invite all of us? Yes, she did.
even our friend Sal Monella?
Richard.
why, after all these years?
well, she said she felt really bad that they hadn't invited us before and apparently they want to get to know us better.
and you wanna go?
well, she insisted.
and I think it would be really nice.
all right.
we'll go.
I wasn't too thrilled about dinner with the Loskis but I could see it meant a lot to my mother.
at school the next day, I couldn't seem to concentrate.
my thoughts kept running back to Daniel.
I wondered what my grandparents had gone through having a son like him when reality interrupted.
Bryce Loski likes you. What?
he's got a big crush on you.
what are you talking about? Bryce Loski does not have a crush on me.
Oh, yeah? In science, I caught him staring at you.
he said it was because there was a bee in your hair.
is that the lamest cover-up or what?
maybe there was a bee.
the only bee you're attracting is B-R-Y-C-E.
I'm telling you, that boy is lost in love land.
come on. Where?
I saw him sneaking off with Garrett. Come on.
are you freaking mental? Juli Baker. You hate her.
that's what's so weird. I don't think I do.
I can't stop thinking about her.
you got it bad, man. What do I do?
you gotta nip this in the bud.
these aren't real emotions. They're not?
you feel guilty because of the egg thing.
Yeah, and I insulted her yard.
exactly. The place is a dump anyways.
it's not her fault. Her dad's got a retarded brother and all their money goes to helping him.
a retard? Well, that ought to tell you something.
about what? About Juli.
what are you saying?
the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, my friend.
Oh, heh. Yeah. Right. Yeah.
I'll talk to you later.
okay.
I'm sorry. I thought...
it's okay. It's fine.
and it was.
because now my confusion was gone.
I was sure I no longer liked Bryce Loski.
mom, are you trying to make the Bakers feel totally worthless?
I want it to be nice.
and why aren't you dressed? I'm going.
I wanted to look good for Juli.
but I didn't want her to think that I wanted to look good for her.
it was a fine line.
a very fine line.
Bryce, they're here. Come on down.
coming!
Hey, come on in.
come in, come in.
I'm glad you could make it. Lynetta, Steven, company's here.
coming! What is this? Homemade pie?
Yes, it's pecan and blueberry cheesecake.
let's take them to the kitchen.
Hi, guys. Hey, looking good.
this is my dad. Hi, I'm Lynetta.
Hi, nice to finally meet you.
nice to meet you too.
my boys are telling me that... Hey, big guy.
Hey, Steven. How are you?
we should've done this a long time ago. Come on in.
this is a cool place.
Yeah, it's all right. Come on, I'll show you my room.
you gotta hear this new song we wrote.
it's so good.
Hi.
you look nice.
I heard you and Garrett making fun of my uncle in the library.
and I don't wanna speak to you.
not now, not ever.
and I say you can. But what you're proposing would require a perpetual-motion machine, so it's not possible.
if you had two opposite charged poles with a neutral conductor
perpetual motion?
here I was, dying inside, and they were talking about perpetual motion.
and how did Juli know about all that stuff?
come on, everybody, dinner's ready. Lynetta!
dinner!
Juli, can I talk to you?
it was wrong, what Garrett said. I know it.
did you know it was wrong when he said it?
Yeah. I wanted to punch him.
but we were in the library.
so instead you just agreed with him and laughed.
Yeah.
then that makes you a coward.
I had to sit across from Juli for an entire dinner.
my dad was right.
we should have barbecued.
I just want to say how wonderful it is to have you share a meal with us.
may it be the first of many.
wrong pipe.
well, we couldn't be happier.
we are just all so thrilled to be here.
Juli, you did a really nice job on your yard.
Thanks. Chet was a big help.
Yeah, I know.
you gotta tell me your secret.
I can't get him to do a thing around here.
Steven. I kid.
I'm telling you, the neighborhood is really coming to life.
I mean, that new house is taking shape.
which one?
you know, the one where they cut down that big ugly tree.
I wanted to say that a lot of people liked that tree, but I didn't.
I didn't want to go against my dad.
some people thought that tree was the jewel of the neighborhood.
Yeah, well, there's no accounting for taste.
so, Matt, Mark, Mark, Matt
you guys are, uh, gonna be graduating soon, huh?
Yeah, thank God.
you don't like high school?
you kidding? No.
high school was the best time of my life.
not for us, no. Yeah, we've had enough of that scene.
so college is probably out of the question, huh?
no, it's a possibility.
they've actually been accepted at several places already. Yes, they have.
Really?
well, that's good.
but, um, we're gonna give music a shot first.
Really? Oh, they are very talented.
Oh, their band is really boss.
they did a bunch of demos and they're really cool.
Thanks, Lyn.
when Steven and I first met, he was playing in a band.
you played in a band?
he was a wonderful saxophone player.
cool. You still play? Well, I...
well, if you want, you can come jam out with us sometime.
uh, you...
no, I mean Heh.
that's not me anymore.
have you boys ever performed in front of an audience?
a lot of times.
the more Matt and Mark talked about their musical exploits the quieter my dad got.
he tried to plaster on a smile now and then but underneath he seemed really sad.
but my parents didn't like him at first.
republicans fought like crazy against the New Deal.
the rest of the evening was painless enough.
but through it all, Juli didn't say a word to me.
never even looked at me.
until she was about to leave.
I'm sorry I was so angry when we first came in.
I think everyone had a good time.
your mom was really nice to invite us.
see you.
her apology made things worse.
Hey, wait for me. I knew I wasn't forgiven.
it was like I wasn't even important enough to hold a grudge against.
well, I think they're a delightful family.
those boys were nothing like I expected.
I thought they were very nice young men.
hoodlums. What?
how you think they can afford all that recording gear?
Steven, please. You can't just make an accusation like that.
don't be so naive, Patsy.
do you know how expensive it is to record a demo?
they're probably stealing hubcaps, for chrissake.
you are such an asshole.
what is the matter with you?
go to hell.
don't you talk to me like that.
Steven, stop!
nobody talks to me like that in my own house! Stop!
I'd seen my father angry before, but this was different.
as I lay in bed that night
I thought about how my dad always looked down on the Bakers.
and how he'd called them trash and made fun of Mr. Baker's paintings.
and now I realized he was just mad at himself.
but why?
Juli called me a coward.
was it possible my dad was a coward too?
I didn't know.
what difference did it make?
Juli Baker was out of my life.
or, more accurately
I was out of hers.
as I was getting dressed for the Loskis' dinner party
I found myself staring at the painting my father had given me and became furious all over again.
Bryce had never been a friend to me, ever.
he hadn't taken my side about the tree, he'd thrown away my eggs and he made fun of me at my uncle's expense.
when my mother called that it was time to go...
Juli, let's go, we're late!
I went out with every intention of telling her that I wasn't going to the Loskis.
please hold these. I need to check my hair really quickly one more time.
your hair is perfect. Really?
but she looked so happy and she'd gone to so much trouble over the pies that I couldn't.
Ooh! Oh, my gosh. Oh, God, what a disaster.
okay. Here, hold one, and you hold this.
I don't wanna hold it. I won't have you hold it.
let's go, boys.
but that didn't mean I had to be nice to Bryce.
and I don't wanna speak to you.
not now, not ever.
it felt good to take charge.
I felt strong, in control. I told Bryce what I thought and I was determined not to talk to him for the rest of the evening.
at dinner it struck me that we were sharing a meal with a group of strangers.
we'd lived across the street from the Loskis for years but except for Chet, I didn't know these people at all.
Mr. Loski was clean and smooth on the outside but it seemed like there was something rotten buried just beneath the surface.
by the end of the evening, all I felt was detached, neutral.
no fireworks, no leftover anger no flutters, nothing.
see you.
I went to bed that night feeling peaceful.
you okay? Yeah.
I was grateful that I had the family I had.
and it felt good to no longer care about Bryce Loski.
the dinner with the Bakers had taken its toll on me.
then the annual school fundraiser arrived and I found myself with a whole new set of problems.
I was a Basketboy.
to fully appreciate the humiliation of being a Basketboy you need to know that the chosen few are auctioned off in front of the student body to the highest-bidding females.
Yes, technically, each of us comes with a lunch in a basket but let's not kid ourselves. This was a beefcake parade.
there he is, my idol.
one word, you're a dead man.
no, man, I'm serious. Listen, you won't believe this.
what?
two of the hottest chicks are fighting over you.
what are you talking about? Sherry is breaking up with Mitch.
she and Melanie are having a bidding war over you.
I don't care.
are you nuts? Sherry dumped Mitch because of you.
you're my idol.
as comforting as it was to be Garrett's idol it didn't diminish the horror of being Basketboy number nine.
and my only hope was that a giant tornado would destroy the school before the event.
it was a long shot.
welcome, everyone to this year's Mayfield Boosters Club Auction.
once again we are pleased to present 20 of Mayfield's finest young men. Bryce, Bryce.
Bryce.
what are you doing here? Juli's in the third row.
so? So she's got a wad of cash.
bullshit. Bull-true.
I saw her counting it by her locker.
and now please give a big Mayfield School welcome to your 1963 Basketboys.
Juli with cash? What did this mean?
was it possible she was gonna bid on me?
first up, we have
Raymond Hughes.
Raymond's on the chess team and his hobbies include stamp collecting and the yo-yo.
remember, when you bid you'll not only be getting the handsome Mr. Hughes you'll also be enjoying a lovely chicken-salad sandwich and what looks to be a tasty bean dip, and
Oh. Excuse me, onion dip.
and a big slice of cherry pie.
okay, who will start the bidding at $5?
thus began the bidding. Anybody?
or in Raymond Hughes' case, the lack of bidding.
very good, here we go.
five. Sold.
ten dollars. Sold.
fifteen. Sold.
come on. Do I hear 10?
ten. Ten.
ten. Peanut-butter-and-banana sandwich.
fifteen.
sold for $15.
number eight is Eddie Trulock.
Eddie is a member of the debate team.
now only Eddie Trulock stood between me and the auction block.
I wasn't interested in his hobbies or what was in his basket.
let's start the bidding at $5. All I could think of was Juli.
anybody? What if she did bid on me?
what if she got in a bidding war with Sherry and Melanie and lost out?
no bidders?
I was contemplating the horrors of this senario when
eight dollars.
there you go. Eight dollars, that's more like it. Do I hear 10?
Juli Baker was bidding on Eddie Trulock?
okay, 8 going once. How could she bid on Eddie?
eight going twice. How could she bid on anyone?
sold to Juli Baker.
next is Basketboy number nine, Bryce Loski.
I knew I was supposed to step forward, but I couldn't move.
step up, Bryce, don't be shy.
better late than never. Ha, ha.
Bryce likes to play baseball.
five dollars. Oh, well, wait until l
ten. Oh.
well, it appears the bidding is underway.
fifteen. Twenty.
fifty. Oh, my.
fifty dollars. Wh
fifty going once.
fifty going twice.
sold to Miss Sherry Stalls for $50.
an all-time record.
Oh, the boosters will be very grateful for such a generous donation.
it's strange.
here I was, having lunch with the hottest girl in school and I was miserable.
we're going up to the lake. My dad has a cabin there and you get the most outrageous tan.
because less than 20 feet away from me was Juli.
my Juli with Eddie Trulock.
she's laughing.
what was she laughing about?
how could she sit there and laugh and look so beautiful?
Bryce, are you all right?
what?
what are you staring at?
nothing.
lunch is really delicious, Bryce.
Bryce, did you hear me?
this is a really delicious lunch.
can we not talk about tans or food?
well, what do you wanna talk about?
I don't know, perpetual motion? Do you know anything about that?
perpetual what?
I don't know what came over me.
it was like I was possessed or something.
Juli, I gotta talk to you. What?
what's going on, Bryce?
what are you doing?
Bryce, stop it.
Bryce, you didn't even make it to first base.
I'll kiss you. Ha, ha.
Juli! Juli!
Juli, wait. Can we talk?
Juli!
what's the matter with you? Leave me alone, Garrett.
you get a date with the finest girl on campus and you blow it for Juli.
you wouldn't understand! I completely don't understand!
we're talking about Juli Baker here.
nightmare neighbor, know-it-all nuisance.
the coop-poop babe.
shut up!
Hey, have you flipped? What's the matter with you?
you know what, if you're gonna be like this,
I don't need the association.
well, good, because neither do I. Yeah, neither do I!
as I walked home with the dirty dishes clanking inside my picnic basket all I could think of was Juli.
and I realized Garrett was right about one thing:
I had flipped. Completely.
Hello?
Oh, heh. Hi, Mrs. Baker. Is Juli there?
Oh. I'm sorry, Bryce. Juli doesn't wanna talk.
please, Mrs. Baker. I gotta see her.
I'm sorry, Bryce.
but I'm afraid she's locked herself in her room.
I tried to go to bed early that night but I couldn't sleep.
I watched her house from my window for hours.
I had to find a way to show her how I felt.
monday morning, as I made my way into school
I was deciding which of the Everly Brothers I'd rather marry when Dana Tressler forced Bryce back into my brain.
Juli. The list is out.
there he is, number nine, your main dish.
Bryce Loski's not my main dish.
Oh, you're sticking to your diet.
it's not a diet, Dana.
I'm over him, okay? I'm glad to hear it.
because rumor has it Sherry's already staking her claim on him.
sherry? Sherry Stalls?
Oh, Liz. Macy. The list is up.
that afternoon, I found myself obsessing about the Basketboy auction.
I could feel myself backsliding about Bryce.
but why should I care if Sherry liked him?
I shouldn't even be thinking about him.
I had to rise above this.
Bryce Loski was no longer in my life.
on the morning of the auction, I was on edge.
I found myself, without even knowing how it happened, staring at my egg money.
I needed a strategy.
it was simple.
if I left my money at home, I'd leave temptation with it.
my strategy suffered a setback when I ran into Mrs. Steuby.
Julianna.
Julianna.
Hello, dear.
I'm so sorry it's taken me so long to get this to you but I keep missing you in the morning.
Mrs. Steuby, I don't want that. You don't have to...
don't be ridiculous. I'm gonna pay you.
I'm going to pay you. I don't want that. I don't want it.
Yeah, I want you to go out and buy yourself something festive.
pedal pushers. Ha, ha.
Mrs. Steuby. Bye, dear.
Mrs. Steuby, I don't want pedal pushers.
no, no. You'll look great.
it's okay.
it's okay. No big deal. Just pretend like I don't have it.
I hear you're planning to bid on Bryce.
what? Who told you that? No, I'm not.
someone saw you with a wad of cash this morning.
how much do you have? It's none of your business.
and I'm not bidding, okay? I don't even like him anymore.
Oh, that'll be the day.
it's true. Go ahead, waste your money on him. I don't care.
and now, will you all give a big Mayfield School welcome to your 1963 Basketboys.
I could say I didn't care all I wanted but seeing Bryce walk out in his jacket and tie holding that picnic basket set my head spinning again.
fifteen going once.
the auction seemed to fly by. Fifteen going twice.
sold to Macy Taylor for $15.
before I knew it, Eddie Trulock was called.
number eight is Eddie Trulock.
which meant Bryce was next.
Eddie is a member of the debate team.
and his hobbies include fishing and model-airplane building.
who will give me $5?
why isn't anyone bidding? He's so nice. Exactly.
nobody?
eight dollars.
sold to Juli Baker for $8.
how did this happen?
was it because I felt bad for Eddie?
or was it because I couldn't trust myself with Bryce?
as I made my way to the multi-purpose room
I contemplated the startling turn of events.
here I was, about to have lunch with Eddie Trulock while the boy I mooned over for half my life was going to share a meal with my mortal enemy.
I wanna thank you for bidding on me.
it was touch-and-go there for a while.
no, I wanted to. This will be fun.
I hear you like building model airplanes. Yeah.
my father and I just finished a Russian MiG-19.
it was made in 1955.
mig's first supersonic fighter.
little tricky because the cockpit was recessed
I tried to give Eddie my full attention.
but it was difficult, because Bryce was right behind him.
Eddie was saying something about intake valves when out of nowhere, Bryce stood up and marched straight towards me.
Hey, Juli, I gotta talk to you.
what are you doing?
he was going to kiss me. To kiss me.
all my life I've been waiting for that kiss.
but not like this. Not this way.
I pedaled home so hard, I thought my lungs would burst.
Julianna?
Julianna.
honey?
what's wrong?
I can't.
sweetheart you can tell me.
Bryce tried to kiss me.
he did?
in school.
in front of everybody.
mom, please don't get it.
it's probably him.
sweetheart maybe you should talk to him.
I can't.
I can't.
Bryce wouldn't leave me alone.
he kept calling on the phone.
and knocking on the door.
he even snuck around the house and tapped on my window.
Juli! Please, I gotta see you!
come on out, just for a minute!
why didn't he understand that I just wanted to be left alone?
please!
after two days, Bryce stopped.
and I thought it was finally over.
then, one afternoon, I was coming into the front room to read when I heard a noise in the yard.
Hey, what's he doing?
Juli, calm down. I gave him permission.
permission? Permission for what? He's digging a hole.
I told him he could.
but why?
I told him he could.
it was torture seeing him dig up my grass.
how could my father let him do this?
Bryce knew I was there too.
he's gone.
a tree?
he's planting a tree?
is it a?
I didn't really need to ask.
I could tell from the shape of the leaves and the texture of the trunk.
it was a sycamore tree.
when she walked out of the door, I thought back to the first time I saw her.
how could anybody, ever, have wanted to run away from Juli Baker?
he looked at me with those eyes.
those once again dazzling eyes.
and I knew that Bryce Loski was still walking around with my first kiss.
but he wouldn't be for long.
as we stood there, I realized that all these years we never really talked.
do you need some help?
Yeah.
but that day, we started.
and I knew we'd be talking for a long time.
guess what I hear most in my life?
are you blind?
a blind man shouldn't go out!
Bingo! That's it
just want to tell him...
I can
but I did not say it
because I am mute, too
good morning, Onion!
living here so long,
I know everyone
like this who smells alcohol
he's Mr. Wong of the Security
good morning, Onion!
a well-known stupid drunk
Hi, Onion!
you can tell I'm Chow? So quick!
I smell...
your perfume from faraway
they even give me a place to live
Why? I work here doing what?
recording doctor's verbal diagnosis
thanks...
the Equal Opportunity Law in HK
the salary is okay
there are many medical experiments here
I'm in one blind-cure project
though we often fail
Dr. Woo and
autumn treat me nice
especially Autumn
I'm not born blind
at eight,
I moved from Taiwan to Hong Kong
I was the best in school,
a genius
then problem came
my eyes were always watery
everything I saw was tinted
one day, I went swimming with girls
show time. I did the fancy dive
from way up
while diving in, my eyes hurt and bred
too late
the retina already fell off
I knew I was blind
that night, I had brain fever and lost my speaking ability
my families left one after another...
the noisy is...
my buddy Jumboball
what the hell? You walk like ghost!
salty Lemon Seven, your favorite!
so much salts again! Sucker!
can't you share?
gobbling
alright, your turn
stop flopping around, here you go
what's the matter?
it has problem breathing?
you have problem
tell me!
I know you can hear bird's talk
constipation?
with such appetite? No way!
what are you getting?
what are you doing?
don't pass it to my bird
leave it alone. Bug me
come here...homework time
a couple of good ones
I dreamt of my ungrateful daughter again
salivating. Dead. Still on drug
you are better
what?
queuing for a massage
you've got nothing to do?
you pay me, or I pay you?
Onion!...
and that's the news for today...
in...
our next program...
when I was little,
I wanted to phone-in the radio
because ever since I was blind
radio's my connection to the world
hello
Hello, please talk
miss Autumn Thank you, fisherman
doc, your coffee Thanks
is Onion throwing up badly?
badly!
he's tough, more than others
like last time, he didn't ask for help
and often jokes over it
I've notice. Usually you don't talk much
except when you talk about the patients
do you like music, or jazz?
it's okay
do you think...
listening to classical music or...
...playing sax is pretentious?
not really. Sax's pretty good
as long as it's pleasant
well, I know how to play it
back in school, every time I played it,
my friends said I was pretentious
when foreigners' playing, they said it's cool!
so, I often practice...
in the toilet
even now, my sax comes with a taste
I think I've got too far
I have two concert tickets for tonight
do you want to go?
no, the exam. I don't want to flunk it
that's true
never mind, next time then
after all, failure is the mom of success
sorry, I'm sorry, Onion...
so sorry, I'm late again
have you been waiting long?
sorry
it is the thirtieth time she cuts my hair
I'm not too greedy
just wish it happen 863 times in my life
what are you thinking? Fallen asleep?
did you have the apples I bought you?
you remember my birthday!
I just told you once
thank you!
someone said
I'm clumsy today
no? Really?
if people has...
one disadvantage
God shall give him one advantage
if you get a lousy body, you'll get a good brain
if you are not pretty, you'll get a nice voice
why I have nothing, and get fat?
it's all your fault!
give ma all! Yummy!
what advantage do you have?
two?
right, you have more
you can't see...
how ugly I am
and you won't tell my secrets
so...
I feel very safe with you
you are the only one I can talk to
if you don't want to listen, tell me
you really don't?
don't like it?
don't rub your nose!
I'm just kidding
did you hear?
I heard it again last night
don't know why
every time I hear it
I feel relax
Dr. Woo said he could play it
but it's not him, I'm sure
he can't play that well
sometimes I want to find out
but don't want to be nosy
if he stops playing, it'll be hell
is it you?
it must be you!
I don't play...sax
then who could it be?
it's a call...
from far away
who talks about his love distress
I feel great for him now
wish he could stay...
with his beloved one...
forever and ever
if you want...
to share your problem with us
give me a call
let's chat in the air
hoping that you can be relieved...
from any distress and problem
I can play sax since small
my father plays in the Taiwan Orchestra
I played sax with him together
I had performance in blind school too
ever since Autumn says she likes sax,
I often play for her at night
don't want her to know it's me
even Dr. Woo can't attract her
not to...
mention me
better not screw up her dream
or she might stop...
cutting my hair
good morning, Onion!
got to go, I'm late. Bye!
is it good?
you are the first one to say that
weird! Why they don't like it?
I know, you are always on my side
did you hear it?
the sax
I just said I felt bad yesterday, and it comes
it happens every time!
meteor!
did you see it? A meteor!
I forgot
how could you see it
but I've made two wishes
is it too greedy?
tell you?
okay, it's about you anyway
the first one: your eyes recover soon
and watch the meteor shower with us
what do you think?
the second one?
okay, I'll tell you
the second one is...
I won't tell you
no pouting!
no rubbing nose!
do you know how it's like?
no. I'll tell you
it's like fireworks in the sky
did I see it?
no
I'm lying?
if you see a meteor gliding across
what wishes would you make?
you have two also?
I know, all the blind people recover
how great!
and the second one?

if I buy insurance...
and die, will you indemnify the beneficiary?
of course
how much is the indemnity?
depends on how much you buy
do you want to buy?
I have time. We can sit down...
have a cup of tea, and talk
I just want the indemnity
because I...My friend...
who bought insurance...
from you died
died? Mr. Cheuk's on leave
call again some other days
bye
you said you had time. Can we...?
some other days...
I don't have much other days

Mr. Cheuk
not many people come for me
most we know
that is nurses' dormitory
water, Miss Autumn
thanks What do you have?
so much I wanted to tell her
looking at her now,
I can't say a word
Mr. Cheuk
how can I help you?
yes
your friend Young, Onion...
...bought an insurance from us
and Autumn Yue is the beneficiary
are you Autumn Yue?
strange friend, huh?
funny nickname...
you think it's funny?
just a few questions for the indemnity
your career is...
nurse trainee
how long do you know each other?
one year and 26 days
wow, you even remember the 26 days
what's your relationship?
I mean, friendship?
common, intimate, lovers?
why should I tell you?
because that's very important
if you are intimate or lovers
he might kill himself to leave you the best
he won't kill himself!
he won't!
he's tough, full of life and hope!
go on, go on
what's your relationship with Dr. Woo?
whom do you like more?
are you really lnsurance Actuary?
does it matter which one like?
Because...because probably...
you two killed Onion...
my God! What did I say?
am I a jealous nut?
Mr. Cheuk, you are the worst man I know
the lowest, the most caddish pest!
autumn!
I...
fisherman, the towel!
do you have epilepsy?
you better have a check-up
God!
you can't tell your real identity
even if you want to, you can't
I felt...
like you're here
so I could really yell at him
sorry about what happened
don't know how to explain
I am Onion, and Cheuk
it's sounds ridiculous, but it's true
we don't disappear when we die
we live in another place
remember...
you cut my hair 13 times?
even cut my ear once
you asked me if it hurt
to be safe,
I'll record again
I am Onion, and Cheuk
believe me
I know it's ridiculous
remember the night before I died...
you saw meteor and made wishes...
for me? Thanks
I am off at ten. Let's have dinner
I can't...
how about midnight snacks?
no trouble?
no
really, I'm fine now
could you have the flowers back?
cheapskate!
how could you take it back?
you gave it to me!
did I say that?
see!
you want it? Take it!
sorry
I know it's for Autumn
in graveyard, your look's obvious
she has a day off, though
it's broken. I think she won't mind
take it
pity me?
for you, really
I get it, thanks
I fell great. Hope you are the same
you will see her
she's in her sister's. The address...
I know, she told me before
thanks
you alright?
why learn swimming suddenly?
you used to yell when I washed you hair...
...and pushed your head down
scared of water and never dare do anything
till it's too late
the more I scare, the better I'll try now
let me get a notebook
so deep, got to jot it down
you're teasing me!
come on, take it Thanks, sis
you like someone but dare not say it
and it's too late. Am I right?
think I won't splash you cause you're pregnant?
don't you need help?
here we are
no parking ahead. Can't go in
three hundreds!
how far ahead?
not far. Take this way
what's up?
can I ask you...
what happen to my little sister who...
...used to be so strong?
thanks for the compliments. I'm fine
okay
strong. Is it a compliment?
I thought it meant bad tempered
come when you want to talk
let me...stay still, Your Majesty
just treat me as Queen later
Dr. Woo?
good guess! You are here
I am just dropping by and see if you're here
and you are
drop by?
it takes at least two-hour to come here
where were you?
here, it's near...the airport!
I went to see somebody off...
so I drop by
hungry?
you bought so much food to the airport?
well, it's cheap there. So...
never mind
my sister
actually I come for you
I worry if you are alright, so...
I bought all these nutriment...
for you
I'll go after I leave them here
you're so nice. Come on in
you're like...
door-keeping gods
this is Dr. Woo
how are you? Fine, how are you?
how are you, baby?
doing butterfly stroke every day
bang, bang, bang. Drive you nut
you are really nice
we live so faraway and you still come
just drop by
stay for dinner, then
sure
my sis needs to talk to someone
let me help. It's heavy
are you sure?
isn't it a bit impulsive?
you should have...
known before
years ago when my first patient died,
I thought the same way
then I told myself:
many things are out of my control
if you give up
then you shouldn't ever start
sis
are you hot, or just doing facial?
just getting to the point
she's quite funny
Yes. She's more simple
how about you?
I know what you mean
the seniors say when you see patients die,
go see the new-born and you'll feel better
but he's not just any patients
he's Onion
you won't understand
I didn't believe it before
until it happens...
to you
I can't go on
let it out, you'll fell better
don't worry
I won't just go
I'll stay till the end of this month
help the new comer...
get used to things
I need time
give me time
I can change your mind
thank you
I feel much better now
coming, coming
who do you want?
my sister?
what a crowd today
so...
many people coming
are you dropping by too?
no, I come for her
I have to talk to you
Really?
I called you
they said you were on leave
sorry about last time
I want my indemnity
I won't reject anything from Onion
fine, but...
you are insurance broker?
my last name's Cheuk
Mr. Cheuk
it's getting more and more complex
you come so far to indemnify. Very nice
stay for dinner
sure, sure
what is that?
watch it. You'll know
I'll watch it later
Mr. Cheuk
Mr. Cheuk, he's calling you
Mr. Cheuk
you are hard-working
still working while on leave
I want to settle this quick for Onion
Dr. Woo, you work hard too
ain't you on leave?
Mr. Cheuk, I think we never met
how do you know my name?
we never met...
doing insurance you had to know everything
onion died too suddenly
we had to check people out
occupational disease. Blind guess
Mr. Cheuk, you look not well
your lips are dark
you better have a check
it's professional. Not blind guess
I queued and bought a cheese cake
for dessert
try it. You'll feel better
autumn hates cheese
she only likes fruit candies
the octagon ones in colorful cans
I can't believe it
you know even that others like to eat?
I don't eat cheese
why do you know?
are you checking on me?
you think I killed him?
no... How could I?
I don't mean it
in fact, I am...
here it comes again
what's the matter with you?
how's it going?
sis, do you have slippers?
for men or women?
better check out...
the nearest hospital
just in case...
autumn?
back in her room. She's pissed off
I didn't mean it
I didn't check on her. Please tell her
okay, okay...
you threw everything up
must be hungry now.
have some cheese cake
sis
the doctors often suggest...
...not to eat too rich after vomiting
no cheese cake. You have something flat?
apple
have it
can we talk,
Dr. Woo?
sure
can we donate Onion's money...
to the hospital...
...for ophthalmology studies?
he wished to help
sure. I can suggest to the hospital...
...to launch a fund...
for the blind people
I thought you really were busy, have no time to go to concerts
now I know
I am quite jealous of him
sorry, it seems not respectful
I think...
he doesn't want to see you like that
mom!
mom!
Hello?
hey Dong-wan. Still at the arcade?
no, I didn't sleep.
I said I didn't sleep.
I didn't sleep!
how dare you say that I'm crazy?
I was talking about my friend, not you.
why can't I joke around, damn it?
damn it?
or you some thug? Your parents raised you that way?
it just shows that bad students come from bad families!
give me your phone.
teacher!
what is it?
my mom just called. She's out front waiting for me.
you see, I told her a pervert has been following me.
what time is it?
attention!
bow!
good-bye, ma'am!
you two come with me.
shit, this is aggravating.
kim Ki-tae, you son of a bitch.
talk.
after hanging out with us, now you dump us?
think our gang is shit? You little dickhead.
Why? Is it too tough? Huh?
look straight.
what soul is there that hasn't been hurt by their parents, shithead?
every night at eleven, my friends are waiting for me in front of the library.
Dong-wan comes from the arcade, and Chang-sub comes after his dance lessons.
since it's too early to split up, we eat ramen noodles at the store and then go home.
people probably don't know.
that high school seniors are no different from salary men.
lunch, getting off of work, and then after-hour drinks.
like the lack of hard-working salary men, most high school seniors don't study much either.
there are so many ballet teachers.
it's tough to make a living.
your sister took your cell, huh?
she always uses it.
Yeah, I guess. I don't need it.
you let her get away with it?
Hey, he's looking again. He lives on your floor, huh?
Yeah, apartment 805.
Hey, stop looking. You'll break the window.
what's so good about her?
she's pretty.
and something's special about her.
then ask her out.
do it to commemorate the exam.
shut up, idiot.
what if I get rejected?
I'll be so humiliated I'd have to move.
Hey, she's coming.
Min-jae, she's coming. - Look, he's embarrassed.
Oh jeez, are you okay?
great ballet move!
I bet it hurt. - Sorry, kids.
Ouch, it hurts.
Hey, lady!
Hey, lady!
this always happens. Nothing works out for me.
if Soo-jin even happens to marry another guy later,
I'd probably live in regret.
flying Boys
I forgot to wake up Soo-in.
did you wake up your brother?
mom, you're really incredible.
today's the college entrance exam.
Min-jae, your father's coming.
here's your lunch. - Min-jae.
do you have your exam ticket? - Yes.
your aunt fixed your lunch early this morning and came, so do well on the exam.
that's my dad.
my dad's a captain of a famous airlines.
half the year he's working in the skies.
the other half, he's sleeping in the covers.
my mother passed away.
five minutes left.
fill in the remaining blanks.
it's snowing!
everyone turn your heads back to the test!
the snow comes again, but not this test.
thanks for the drinks. - Drink up.
Chang-sub, when will you teach me how to breakdance?
forget about it and just go study.
thank you.
seeing you like that makes you look like some good student.
screw it.
who cares if I have to take it again next year.
do whatever you like.
why'd you take the exam if you're not going to college?
I wanted to leave a memory behind.
don't like it?
well, Kim Ki-tae in our class even took the exam.
do thugs like him want to go to college now?
even if he takes it, he's nothing.
Plus, he's not in that gang anymore.
Hey, check them out.
the exam is all over, so they dress up like that already.
how cute.
Chang-sub, let's pick them up.
you're a really funny bitch. Hey bitch.
didn't you say you wanted to go screw in a video room?
stop lying, you crazy bitch.
you're the one who wanted to have sex there.
I did? - Then, I did?
hey bitches, that's enough!
excuse me! - What?
take your bags and fight. - Don't butt in.
did all of you fucking eat trash to talk so dirty?
Hey, asshole. - My purse is wet!
hurry and spit it out.
Ahn Hyung-mee!
Hwangbo Soo-jin, I like you.
what did you say? - I said I love you.
I want you to know how I feel.
I know you're popular.
Ahn Hyung-mee, are you a lesbian?
what if I am?
Oh my goodness.
so you're saying you want to go out with me?
who cares what people are if they like each other?
okay, that's your problem so I won't say anything.
anyway, I'm flattered that you like me.
but wouldn't it be weird if we were to suddenly get close?
to tell you the truth, I didn't know until just now that you were even in my class.
like you said, I'll just know how you feel, okay?
crazy bitches.
you should've said that to their face.
what are you going to tell your dad?
when's his flight over? - In three days.
it's okay.
my dad couldn't even tell that I had a broken nose.
Hey, what if we jerk off to some pornos till then?
jerk yourself off.
lee Chang-sub, want me to tickle your dick?
take it off.
Ouch, it hurts.
Hey! My dad left his car keys!
our little Min-jae can drive now. So cute.
stop!
I feel awesome! You all suck!
don't let go!
come back in! Roll up the window.
get back inside!
fucking lunatic.
be careful. You don't have a license.
no problemo!
Hey, don't worry.
when you go to jail, I'll send you a lot of goodies.
tell the truth. You like getting hit, don't you?
mom, we'll be happy forever.
mother, I'll take good care of my hubby.
come to the arcade. - Okay.
hurry and park. - I will.
does it really have that effect?
Yes!
of course! It's the best for a diet!
didn't you read it in the health magazine?
I'll have new students in no time.
then I'll promote it. - Okay.
what the hell?
Oh my goodness!
Oh no. - No.
ma'am, it wasn't me!
what? I know!
but I still need to report it.
please listen to me. - What's wrong with you?
did you drink?
a high school student? - Yes.
with no driver's license? - Yes.
drinking and driving? - Yes.
please have mercy.
plan to graduate from high school? - Of course.
I must've gone crazy after the exam. My head hurts from studying.
give me your student lD and phone number. I'll need your info.
here it is.
I don't lie.
so can't you keep it a secret?
you can leave now.
I called the family. It's a matter of time now.
did he die? - Yes.
he was already dead when you reported it.
I'm here for Kim Kyung-soo. I got a phone call.
any other adult came?
we need an adult here.
I'm his son. There's no other adult at home.
Really?
follow me. - What's going on?
what's wrong?
he's in my class.
hello.
we have a new course. It's ballet.
look here. Why are there a few students?
there was more in that jazz dance before.
sir, people view ballet to be very professional, and...
since the kids' classes are full, we'll let people enroll freely, and begin this class.
I made some soup and dishes for you, and put them in the fridge.
but why are you eating junk food?
want the cucumber dish I made for you?
that's okay.
we're out of eggs.
this is your dad's underwear, huh?
it's mine! And don't touch my underwear.
you cute boy.
how tall are you now? You're taller than your dad, huh?
now you're all grown up.
and you'll be in college soon.
you're all ready to even get married.
tell dad to get married instead!
I'm going to the army.
you cute little brat.
Min-jae, your Auntie has to go.
Min-jae, just soak the dishes in water.
I'll wash them later, okay?
this tastes terrible.
I have to go to college if I wanna get married.
if I screw up, I might not get married.
but I do want to get married.
Min-jae!
wake up. - Go away!
wake up!
you reek of alcohol, you lunatic.
remember our date Saturday? Are you ready?
don't ask.
I'm heading out.
where are you going? - I've got dance practice.
let's go together after class.
focus! Listen carefully.
Joon-suk, what's up for Saturday?
in front of Galleria at one. Hot girls from Eunsung High are coming.
this time it's for real.
see, you bastards?
Hey, I'm wearing my leather jacket that day, okay?
no fake leather, either.
Min-jae, forget about Hwangbo. - Crazy bastard!
my boy, you should start a new life.
Hello?
having a great time? Think this class is a trash can?
Yes.
what?
she's going too far. How much does she want?
she didn't say how much, but I think she wants money.
she's got something up her sleeve.
you're coming, right?
trust us, my boy. - Who are you?
Hey! Hey!
I saw tons of cons like her. Don't be scared.
what's wrong? Don't trust that I'll help?
you're that boy at the hospital, right?
let me see. - No.
come on!
let me see it for a sec! - Let go!
I can't tell which floor it is.
you wanna see a dead person's stuff, you freak?
I'm just curious.
what are you kids doing there?
do you know where Kim Ki-tae lives?
I don't think anyone's home.
he may be at the hospital with his brother.
I said you can't see it!
it's no big deal. He only has 50, 000 won in his account.
what do you want?
the police said you can't be reached.
so?
they asked me to bring your dad's stuff.
you son of a bitch!
let go! That fucking asshole!
why'd you just stand there?
ballet Lessons Available
mother.
this sucks.
we always eat ox-tail soup.
Soo-jin, wanna go to the salon?
you must've found a coupon.
mom, I wanna go instead. Give it to me.
goodness, look at your posture.
your clothes won't even look good on you.
mom, clean the fridge while you're here.
everything's rotten.
you need help. You need to look like a real girl.
take ballet classes.
as a gift for finishing the exam, I signed you up.
buy something again on the home shopping channel?
it's a three-month course. And it'll fix your posture.
all pretty girls with nice figures do this these days.
okay, okay. I'll do it.
but mom, don't you want me to apply for college next month?
who wants you to go all the way to Jeju lsland for school?
people will think you're a bad student.
think everything works out as you planned?
you have to learn ballet!
I told you I'll do it. But mom...
Hi, my son. Where are you?
of course, it is. All military service is hard.
hurry and come eat.
your brother's almost here. Pour him some soup.
what do you...
what the hell do you want?
what's this?
fried dumplings.
have a nice meal, teacher.
thank you.
the noodles here are delicious! Have some.
look here, ma'am.
you seem to think we can be played, but his old man knew he took out the car that day.
go home and eat, idiot.
50, 000 won from each of you.
since there's three of you, 150, 000 won.
don't give it to her.
he should almost be here.
Oh, hello.
Wow! You weren't kidding!
I couldn't believe it when I heard.
pleased to meet you.
so I heard you liked ballet since you were little.
I'll sign all of you up.
where there's a will, there's a way. I know you'll all succeed.
of course! - Trust me.
but if you quit mid-way, you know it's not my fault if you get ratted on, right?
of course.
you can also perform at the community festival in February.
Mr. Kim, shall we go?
okay, let's go. - Bye.
ballet?
perform? Who will?
Chang-sub.
eat this.
your aunt made you your favorite lotus root dish.
dad, I wanna learn English at a language institute.
Really? How much is it?
150, 000 won with a discount.
it's never a waste of money to learn English.
the more you study the more you'll learn.
when will your exam scores come out?
it won't be for a while.
these days, big companies retire people early.
so a technical job or having some license is the best.
is Hankuk Aviation too hard to get into?
Yes.
I should've applied you to the Air Force Academy.
too late now.
while you're at it, get your driver's license.
get a real license instead of playing those games.
that game's no use in helping you drive.
think you'll drive well?
Hey, why is she acting like some princess?
Jina sleeps with her teddy bear, so I always need to be loved.
you're going to sleep? - Nope.
Jina is thirsty.
I heard you're the best dancer at your school.
everybody's good.
I've always envied people who could dance well.
I'm a terrible dancer. I'm a total stiff.
are you proud of that?
be nice.
where will you all go for college? Did you pick your major?
Hey. Think you can get in that easily?
so-young and I wanna be teachers.
Jina picked fashion, and Soo-jin's going to Jeju University to be a vet.
Why?
you don't like Seoul?
why out in Jeju?
I couldn't get into vet school at Seoul National University, so I might as well go to the second best.
but why all the way to Jeju?
I mean, just that the island's so far away.
you'll see a lot of honeymooners.
you see, Soo-jin's very popular in our class, and she's good at everything.
is that so? Like what?
Soo-jin's really strong.
and last Valentine's Day, she got a lot of chocolate from the girls at school.
that's not all. She knows a lot of curse words.
they're so dirty.
she also eats her lunch really fast.
she even caught a roach with her bare hands.
and she never loses to the teacher.
Soo-jin's so cool.
did you like your partner? - Think I would, idiot?
I'm sorry, sir. - Who taught him how to drive?
I'll pay for the damages, sir. - Bring the owner!
what a sorry sight.
let's go.
Kang Min-jae!
what are you doing here? - Hey.
it would've been nice if I was your partner for the date.
Soo-jin.
I love you.
what's going on? Soo-jin, look out!
this is so humiliating.
you see, I can't baby sit you.
you're too young. You know that, right?
Plus, I'm leaving for Jeju lsland.
very far away.
no, Soo-jin.
Soo-jin, I've liked you since middle school.
Soo-jin!
where am l?
number 27, Kang Min-jae.
guys like you who are all grown up but don't have any direction, will all be sent to the army by the Education Ministry.
Congratulations. - Teacher.
Min-jae, congratulations!
I'm disappointed in you!
I thought you've matured.
you're nothing but a rotten son.
give me the car keys, boy!
dream about your mom again?
give me a cigarette.
why'd you open the window? It's cold.
needed some air to do some thinking.
anyway, what'll you do if Soo-jin goes to Jeju?
don't ask.
Chang-sub, why does my life suck?
you're lucky. You know what you want to do.
Hey, there's two decent girls.
Hey, wasn't that the yogurt lady in front of Kim Ki-tae's house?
we shouldn't have come.
where the hell's Chang-sub?
it's the guy from the Chinese restaurant.
isn't that the video store guy?
how about we introduce ourselves?
I'll go first.
ever since our community center opened,
I took every class there was,
so you could look at me as the local cultural event leader.
I feel like I've seen you before.
what a loser.
be honest.
you came here because of the pretty instructor, huh?
are you blind?
mister, we've been specially invited to this class.
by special invite!
Hello, instructor!
Oh, hello.
you hit it big.
didn't you two get your training outfit?
how can we wear this? - How can we wear this?
what is this?
this hurts like hell.
there's only a string in front.
the front's totally exposed.
Hey, do we tie it to the left or the right?
I tied it in the middle.
it fucking hurts. - Are you okay?
I'm gonna kill Chang-sub if he doesn't come.
excuse me.
Oh boy!
I'm very pleased to meet you all.
since today's our first class, we will learn the basic moves.
don't touch me. - This is all your fault.
think I asked for this?
your bottom.
don't you have a brain? Are you a pervert?
you have it on backwards. - It hurts.
see this triangular, pocket-looking thing?
the front goes like this.
like this!
what about the back?
this supporter is made so that dancers won't have any panty lines.
so there's nothing for the rear.
this string... Come here.
the string goes around... - I got it!
Hey, wait for me.
lower your left shoulder.
now, Passe.
front, Devant.
second.
plie and then two, Arabesque.
now, from the heels.
wanna die?
why are you looking? - 'Cuz she's hot.
Plie!
pas de Bourree.
now, Arabesque.
you got us into this. - Screw you, you bastard.
how long do we stay like this?
raise your thigh. - Wait!
I'll do it on my own, okay?
straighten your shoulders. - Wait...
if you do this, it'll make things harder.
what are you doing? - Watch it!
you put me in these weird panties.
don't touch my body. Never.
Arabesque!
teacher, my feelings are getting weirder.
why do ballet dancers wear this?
my anus is killing me.
Min-jae.
Min-jae.
what are you doing? Laundry?
it's nothing.
Hey, don't let your aunt catch you masterbate.
you rascal.
Jina loves sweet red-bean soup. Jina wants it now.
why isn't Miss Hwangbo here?
her lover could be leaving soon to eat red-bean soup.
I want red-bean soup, too.
sweet red-bean soup. - Chang-sub.
I saw Kim Ki-tae this morning.
he's working at the convenient store.
is he some greedy pig?
how many jobs is he working?
he's an orphan now, huh?
anyway, he's vicious, man.
when he quit that gang, he got trampled on a few times. Did not know?
Hey, look over there.

it's okay. It's okay.
excuse me, is it necessary to push ourselves like this?
we're not doing this to be experts.
she's right.
I won't lose weight like this.
Yeah, it's got no effect.
I told you we should've learned aerobics.
it's never easy! Just do what she tells you.
plie.
I gave a traffic ticket today. - Good boy.
Soo-jin, don't think it's easy living alone.
you know how hard it is?
do you have to go to Jeju?
when it comes down to it, your mom and I want you to just study comfortably at home until you get married.
that's right.
she doesn't know what struggle is. Struggle!
dad, let her go.
whether she raises a pony or rides one down there, let her struggle.
Hyun-sung, come and eat!
Yeah, come eat with us. - Yeah, join us.
no, I don't want to intrude. I'll eat later.
suit yourself. - Okay, then.
dad, if Soo-jin goes to Jeju I can have the room all to myself?
shut up. Who said she's going?
why do you always pick on me?
mom, you see.
if I go to college like this, nothing will change at all.
dad, did I ever complain about anything?
this is the first time I asked for something.
you lost a lot of weight.
I've been struggling, that's why.
Mrs. Yang.
all the older ladies here switched over to the aerobics class.
Yes, I know.
this is frustrating.
there's been a lot of complaints.
this isn't some professional course.
you're supposed to match your students' level.
and what's wrong with our level?
that's not what I meant. This is a hobby class.
those ladies quit because they weren't losing weight.
what did I tell you. It sucks here.
I told you we shouldn't have come.
that yogurt-selling lady. The psycho.
she's not here today.
that's what I'm saying.
the cops are still questioning her.
two of her kids died.
did they die? Or were they killed?
mister, are you crazy? You some thug?
who are you to insult someone who you even don't know!
do you know what her life is like? Do you?
"the Lonely Sun" Video Rental
during the financial crisis, her husband fed the whole family sleeping pills, and gassed the house.
everyone died. Except for her.
afterwards, she worked to keep herself busy.
but after losing her precious kids all at once, and being investigated by the police for a few months, she's gotten a little weird.
I see.
that lady is really odd.
she'd steal people's mail.
she's not that kind of person.
she's usually a kind lady.
last year, we learned jazz dance together.
wow, you learned jazz dance, too?
Mr. Doh-il and I suggested we have a ballet class.
so that's why we're here. - Hey, let's go.
I was so excited about learning a classic dance.
but what can we do? Students are dropping out.
it's no big deal.
since Chang-sub and Jong-suk got some great talent it gives me hope as a ballerina.
I can't come starting next week.
I think I'll be picked up to be a back-up dancer for a new hot singer.
Really? Congratulations. - That's awesome.
then how many of us are left now?
Soo-jin, Jina is cold.
Yeah, it is.
Seung-un didn't come? - She's got an ancestral rite today.
ancestral rite? What a lie.
she didn't come because Chang-sub isn't here.
anyway, why'd Joon-seok tell us to meet here?
it's stupid.
Hey, why's the Ninja Turtle here?
to see you, idiot.
I'm the loner today.
Min-jae, Jina wants to drink hot chocolate.
okay, shall we take our Jina for some hot chocolate?
it's Dong-wan's treat.
what a nice day for hot chocolate.
do you like the ballet class?
think I would? My mom made me take it.
I'm quitting after I go to college.
mommy!
Kelly, stop.
I'm sorry.
why are you laughing?
Oh, nothing.
Hey, it's really cute. - Kelly, let's go.
Soo-jin, I got the tickets.
Thanks, Joon-seok.
is it too cold to ride on the boat?
this might help.
it's warm.
I have to go.
Why? What about the boat ride?
I forgot about the ancestral rite today.
you have one, too?
see you later.
Hey!
Kang Min-jae!
Where's Min-jae going?
he said he has an ancestral rite today.
but his mom's ancestral rite isn't today.

I'm okay.

there won't be any when you really want one.
here, have a drink.
bottoms up.
see? Delicious, huh?
do you know how wonderful it is to be young?
don't go around frowning that handsome face of yours.
did "Save the Green Planet" come in?
Yes, it did. But it just got rented out.
to this handsome young boy here.
eighth floor.
want to watch this with me? - You lied about that rite, huh?
don't want any coke?
I also have coffee and citron tea.
I can make it right away.
I'm okay.
there's plenty here.
try it.
the place is messy, huh?
looks like my aunt didn't come today.
there should always be a woman in the house, huh?
you should've started it without me.
want some?
I have to go.
but it's not over yet.
lend it to me later.
don't go.
I'm sorry.
you have something on your face.
it's a tangerine-peel.
your breath smells.
it smells like tangerine.
it's not coming off.
just raise it up.
sorry.
you see...
I love you.
who is it?
Soo-jin.
you've gone on a lot of dates, huh?
dates?
well...
when did you first sleep with a girl?
Soo-jin, so you're in love.
what do guys think after they do it?
Hi, dad.
what are you doing?
I rented a movie.
Hey, go do it in your room when you got the urge.
and don't overdo it.
I see you've bought a lot.
good night.
clumsy kid.
Oh boy.
strange kid.
he's got some weird tastes.
your dad graduated from Hankuk Aviation Academy, right?
Yes, sir.
wouldn't it have been great if you had went there?
going with your dad to alumni meetings.
Yes, I guess.
got any other place you wanna go to?
Hankuk Aviation is out, and Hanyung University is possible.
but I can't guarantee it.
talk it over with your dad and decide.
how about the veterinary school at Jeju University?
no chance.
tell Number 28, Han Chul-jin, to come in.
go ahead and eat.
give me a pack of cigarettes.
Why? I can't have one?
hurry and take it. If I get caught, I'm fired.
like the parking lot?
you saw me.
who's he?
my brother. His name's Ki-chul.
didn't I tell you not to eat junk food?
he's done eating.
Ki-chul, put on your scarf.
it's cold outside. Put on your mask, too.
hello.
let's go.
thank you. - Thank you, my butt.
Soo-jin!
Hey.
you look pretty.
what are you doing later?
Why? - Well.
let's talk later.
Min-jae!
awesome! You finally did it!
let's go somewhere afterwards.
Why? You wanna rent another video?
what's with him?
who knows. You know how weird he is.
Hey, what's going on? - It's nothing.
what's wrong?
Hey, Min-jae!
talk to me.
what's with you?
step away.
what did you mean by that?
you regret what we did?
think I'm not good for you?
you think I'm nothing?
Soo-jin!
have you lost your mind? What's wrong with you?
I don't know what... - Let go!
Min-jae, that's enough.
what? So what?
Oh, ballet?
fuck it! I'm through!
whether you report me or not, I don't care!
I'm not doing this shit anymore! Got it?
Hey, you! - What?
what's with you?
what about me? - Min-jae, stop.
that little bastard.
who are you? What do you want?
what are you doing?
you should stay at home or study for the test again.
since you hang out here, no wonder your scores are so low, you rotten punk.
you punk!
I said stop it!
then let's go. I said let's go.
okay, let's go.
if you put stockings on my boy again for this crap,
I'll run you out of this neighborhood, got it?
miss Hwangbo.
you're a snot.
go inside, boy.
who do you think you are?
you've totally lost your mind, boy.
just because I'm not around, are you gonna make everyone think we're some wacko family?
this is so humiliating.
and what's this? What is this?
did you bring some girl home?
Where'd you learn to do this kind of stuff?
Where's the stick? Where is it?
if you do this one more time, I'm kicking you out of this house.
got it!
I'm sorry. I'll never do it again.
your exam scores came out, right?
bring it here.
there, that's good.
luckily we've got ace photographer Angus Snapforth to do our credits.
he works longitudinally
developing his negatives in Turkish-bath cabinet.
so this should be just the job for him.
and he has promised to make it snappy.
37 miles to the north, a bit east, and then up a bit lies Pinchcliff.
a village perched under the blue welkin
with it's own steam-driven cheese factory, a camping site, a local paper
and it's own TV station.
open to all the winds that blow, where the sun rises above Lonetree Hill
lives our cycle-repairer, Theodore Rimspoke.
doesn't look as if business is very thriving, does it?
it's only our postman, old foot-slogging Dan Hoofer, who makes his way there
with the local rag and outstanding bills. His greatcoat has diamond tread.
he's colour blind and has been run over a couple of times
walks with a list to port and plays the big bass on festive occasions.
not much more to say about Hoofer.
cycle-repairer Rimspoke is an independent sort of bloke.
more of an inventor than a businessman.
famous for his ingenious designs,
such as pedal-activated combined shaving and raspberry-picking machine.
he uses a copying pencil, instant coffee and his own patent telescopic ruler.
Sonny Duckworth is the early bird personified.
hatched out in a weeping willow. A born optimist
with muffler, felt slippers and indifferent morals. As Sonny puts it:
the early worm gets the bird.
difficulties he treats as trifles, the impossible as a challenge.
he's Rimspoke's right-hand man, counsellor, and friend.
run over by a reaper and got a crew-cut, short back, bushy by the ears.
found under the roots of a knotted oak and included as a Rimspoke resident.
Lambert is a personal pessimist, and only really at home in Darkest Devon.
and this is their home, standing in its own pleasant grounds,
enjoying all the benefits of Rimspoke's ingenious gadgets.
well, string me up and stuff me in a hen-coop!
Hi, Theodore! Look at this.
this morning's post.
nothing but bills. Put them on the window sill with the others.
take a look at that super car!
look at that there Rudolph Gore-Slimey!
do you know that fellow? - Know him?
Yes, I'll say I know him. - Do you know him personal?
that there Rudolph, he was a kind of apprentice to me in my workshop.
then he suddenly packed it in and went to town.
and now he's in big business, and a racing driver, I see.
you don't say . . ? big business, too?
beats me how that there Gore-Slimey
got into the racing circuit?
competing with the best in the world, it says.
look! Smashing picture on the back too.
well, I never . . . !
I might have guessed as much.
guessed? Guessed what?
I wonder what he's got under his bonnet?
so that's why Gore-Slimey was in such a hurry to go to town, huh?
there's some skulduggery going on here.
more trouble brewing, I'll wager . . . - No, no, Lambert.
say, Theodore, what's skulduggery?
Yeh, what's skulduggery?
well, we better get down to some honest work.
out with you, and set to work!
when the call to work goes out, Brother, please include me out!
put your hat and coat on, Lambert!
come on !
I see, doing your daily dozen, Lambert?
I say, what's skulduggery, Sonny?
skulduggery?
that is skulduggery!
Oh.
the north wind's blowing from every quarter today, Sonny?
lovely weather for working.
I'm scared, I am.
I don't like it when it's blowing from every quarter.
let's get this contraption working! - All, right, just leave it to me.
computerised production of flagpoles for the Swiss Navy!
that'll be 10, 75.
theodore is self-supporting, has his own electric power, water laid on
and turns an honest penny on the side. Lambert remains a true romantic.
the profits are hardly likely to cause repercussions on the money market
still the three of them up the hill are content enough.
don't be frightened, Lambert. I'll switch the TV on, Theodore.
I don't like TV. - There's no bogeyman in the box.
you never can tell, can you .
and now for the news, read by pig farmer Archibald Skrimshank.
this is usually pretty exciting.
the situation is still very tense in the Middle East.
here . . .
dang me sideways! - I'm scared, I am, Theodore.
and now after the news, the World of Sport.
we deserve a little extra treat tonight.
I expect you'd like some dewrinkled raisins, Sonny?
help yourself, there's plenty for everyone.
. . . the current Motor Racing sensation, Rudolph Gore-Slimey.
after winning his third successive Grand Prix. A few words, please.
I came of humble stock from the little village of Pinchcliffe.
worked for a while in a cycle repair shop run by an eccentric rustic.
forget his name . . . theodore . . .
theodore Rimspoke, I think it was.
just hark at him . . . I mean to say . . . - Quiet now, Sonny!
humble beginnings, eh?
funny to think how easy it can be to get stuck in a rut like that place.
but there was no stopping you?
no, and I think my latest invention will revolutionise motor racing!
what invention? - This super retometric distributor.
it raises the jet-injection factor to 1 000 and the corradial effect by 112%.
so that's your game! So that's your invention, is it, Rudolph?
funny, because here's the working drawing !
what did you say? Has Gore-Slimey gone and swiped your invention?
Yes, he must have collared it when he was working here as my assistant.
well, string me up and stuff me in a hen-coop. I never heard the like!
I say, please, could you pass me another liquorice allsorts?
hush ! we must listen to what Gore-Slimey has to say.
let me repeat, I'm prepared anytime, anywhere, to meet any challenge.
thank you for talking to us.
we hope we shall soon see someone putting up a challenge.
now the Chairman, District Veterinary Surgeon Roger Uddersfield
will present today's commercials.
for guaranteed social success, use Brough, the swift-action hair tonic.
switch off that commercial nonsense! - Remember the name, Brough!
recommended by egg-heads!
don't let them fool you, Theodore! - Well, what's a bloke to do now?
you're going to challenge!
no, no, that'd be dangerous.
you pipe down, Lambert! - Challenge him?
I do have a little secret tucked away in the coach-house. Might be fun . . .
have a go! Could you get this completed, Gore-Slimey wouldn't need
any driving-mirror! Just imagine Il Tempo Gigante!
Rimspoke's reply to the Italian Ferrari !
out of the way, macadamised snail! - Save your felt-slippers, Sonny.
well, shall we take a peep inside the coach-house and see what we've got?
Yes, let's! - Oh, no.
there isn't much I can do with this thing here.
it's in a sorrier state than I suspected.
you could soon fix this up. - Can't build a car without a penny.
I haven't even got the nuts and bolts.
we'll have to make a real killing!
you could raise the wind, could you?
a divinity shapes our ends.
Stick'em up!
hand it over! - Do you suppose I've got any money?
this bloke's a poor as a church mouse!
this won't solve our problems. - Well, blow me. I'll be . . .
well, blow me. I'll be . . .
that really hurt. Never felt such a pain before.
wouldn't never ever have thought it possible.
move over! - Can't I have the inside berth tonight?
don't we all have our places? - I never get the inside berth.
there's such a draft off the floor. - That's why I take the inside berth.
come on, pipe down !
well, good night to you, Sonny. Sleep well .
Nighty!
Sonny!
Sonny!
I say, Theodore? Has he gone out?
I wonder why?
Theodore's feeling a bit down in the dumps.
I wonder if it is because he hasn't got enough money to build the car, Sonny?
think you'll be able to help him out, eh, Sonny?
I think I'll just stretch my carcase a bit more.
oi ! string me up and stuff me in a hen-coop!
rolls-royce 1905 model! Solid gold .
acetylene lamps.
gosh, transverse interleaved suspension. Silicon finish . . .
what sort of a spooky get-up is that?
he must be oozing with dough !
gosh ! he's using dollar bills as fly-whisks!
Aladdin Oil " !
he must be one of those oil sheiks!
perhaps we could funnel a little in Theodore's direction . . .
snickety snoo! How too, too snickety snoo.
if this isn't tempting providence, I'd like to know what is.
an ape, honestly. A genuine cross between a chimp and a gorilla .
this is no joking matter!
there should be plenty of money here for Theodore's new design.
well, string me up and stuff me in a hen-coop!
talk about an Oriental chick!
and that fierce-looking money-grubber!
Desperados! What eez the bizniz going on here?

thrown out? Not possibull!
throw out of the tent of Sheikh Abdul Ben Bonanza?
idiot! You stupid gorilla dam blockhead.
Sonny's not the type to give up easily! At a pinch he gets his fertile brain
work overtime and changes his line of attack.
once his mind's made up, there's no stopping Sonny.
Ah, yes, the Pinchcliffe Gazette.
that's an idea all right.
an ad inserted here will have world wide coverage!
my Spanish gambit eez successful! And it's Desperados to move.
your check easy to overcome. I just go through weez my castle.

Yeh, gotta spend a penny.
perhaps you could fetch the paper? - Yeh, I'll do that for you .

of the new racing car now under construction by Theodore Rimspoke.

I wonder who's gone and . . ?
so, that's it. Sonny has been at work.
Yeh, Sonny has been at work.
who, me? - Yes, you!
what've you been up to now, Sonny? - What've you been up to now, Sonny?
just a few casual acquaintances. - Sonny's casual acquaintances, eh?
they're apt to be a bit suspect.
I believe we've got something outside. - Sounds like it.
ze silence here is as profound as in ze desert. All people inside ze house.
emanuel, go knock up ze door!
would you open the door, Lambert? Someone's lost his way and landed here.
hurry along, Lambert, you like receiving visitors, I know.
Lambert, man, don't be scared just because the door creaks a bit.
look at Sonny! Cool as a prize cucumber.
give them a nice welcome, Lambert. - Yes, I certainly will.
Oh, gosh! - Salaam, salaam!
may Allah protect thee and thy house.
I have journeyed from afar to have a good squint at Rimspoke.
have no fear, friend! My chauffeur not dangerous, just a bit inquisitive.
very, very inquisitive!
what sort of a jungle denizen might this be?
must have been smuggled in in a crate of bananas.

Yes, that's supposed to be me.

Ah, you verry kind. We come to have pow-wow and you must listen to me.

Yes, pleez sign! - You're on dangerous ground .

well, it might well be.
Bravo! So now pleez sign contract.
we're heading straight for disaster. I know it.
it's amazing what you can do with money!
and a string of oil wells to back you up.
damn me if Theodore, the bird
and our ungainly furry friend with the rucksack haven't really go cracking!
nuts and bolts, sprockets and spindles.
skilled hands engaged in precision lathe-work
on rotary hydrogenic valves.
with one vigilant eye cocked on the doings of willing helpers
who run unnecessary risks without the protection of safety footwear.
work proceeds day and night.
mysterious fluids seethe and bubble in carboys, copper tubes and on hotplates.
theodore is experimenting with all kinds of fuel
and hand-made thinly rolled body panels.
behind dark goggles Theodore is concocting a motorised carriage
that is going to prove a sensation in the motor-racing world
with technical finesses which entail radical innovations in the carburetion !
straight down the lightning conductor! Theodore has taken proper precautions
against natural catastrophes and unforeseen punctures.
il Tempo Gigante features special tyres, with steel reinforcement.
and seven layers of chicken netting welded into West Indian rubber alloys.
when Theodore builds an engine, he doesn't settle for a mere two-stroke.
he has drilled 12 cylinders and fitted them with concave linings
rammed in a whole heap of high-tension ignition plugs
linked to three-inch hyper-polished exhaust manuals.
the finished product weighing 2. 8 tons
is impressive enough to shake any major motor factory to its foundation .
it takes a full year to knock out a vehicle like Il Tempo Gigante.
the day Theodore completed the prototype,
the Bristol seismograph registered 7, 8 on the Richter scale.
not a bad start for a do-it-yourself village enthusiast.
here's the late news.
it has been confirmed that Il Tempo Gigante is ready for its supreme test.
people in Pinchcliffe are confident that Rimspoke
can show Gore-Slimey a clean pair of heels.
we shall see when the chips are down.
time will show!
Hi, you'll frighten them out of their wits!
Sonny! Sonny!
who is it? Where is he?
I can hear something real horrible.
there must be someone outside snooping around.
Theodore, there's someone snooping around at the dead of night.
I bet it's someone after your car. I think we should hide in the cellar.
what? In the cellar?
night-time intruders? - Yes, I think there are people about.
our burglar alarm should deal with car thieves, and it's all set up.
you go to the right, Sonny, on the other side of the coach-house,
and I'll go this side.
and you keep an eye on the door. - I'm scared, I am, Theodore.
I never been so scared. Never thought I would ever be so scared.
hush, someone's coming!
that's Mister Gore-Slimey in the bag all right.
well, string me up and stuff me in a hen-coop!
gracious . . .
so it's you strung up and dangling there, Lambert?
I walked slap into it!
that rope was intended for Rudolph, so you'll have to forgive me, Lambert.
that put the skids on old Gore-Slimey.
sir Sheikh Abdul Ben Bonanza, Ladies and Gentlemen.
we are gathered together to unveil Rimspoke's technical masterpiece
which in tomorrows Grand Prix will challenge the world's racing drivers
including Rudolph Gore-Slimey in his 12-cylinder Boomerang Rapido.
we're gratified to have TV coverage today,
in black and white and in choice colours.
this event is being transmitted via the Pinchcliffe TV control panel
designed by Theodore Rimspoke and broadcast nationwide . . . full stop.
to mark this auspicious occasion we have invited one of our greatest brads.
despite an attack of the sniffles and the handicap of a mane of unruly air
composed a laudatory epic: Hanbury Dapplenag!
greetings, mighty son of the desert waste
on whose oil-wells your stupendous wealth is based
by whose presence this ceremony is graced
our great inventor, thanks to your banking account
was able to sting you for a sizable amount
and so in this week-end's great race we folk
can cheer on our hero Theodore Rimspoke
driving a very speedy vehicle which Bears the name of my modest shanty:
thank you, Dapplenag, and may the Government grant your application
for a three-year Bardic Travelling Scholarship.
and now I shall ask Sheikh Abdul Ben Bonanza to rise and be upstanding.
as funds from North Sea is not yet available for projects such as these,
an overseas sheikh has generously stepped into the breach.
this entitles him to the honour of unveiling this super car.
sheikh Abdul Ben Bonanza, she's all yours!
I must ask the audience to retain your seats and your composure.
we have TV coverage, and Theodore will now answer a few snaky questions.
today's news features Rimspoke's sensational Il Tempo Gigante,
capable of challenging Gore-Slimey's GT Super Boomerang Rapido.
congratulations on the car! I must say, equipped with radar and all?
that's right. In the event of fog and landslides.
and to anticipate any concealed entrances.
could we have a rundown?
let's start with the cranking handle, which starts the engine up forward
which in turn starts the carburettor
which finally activates the rocket engine at the rear.
and then she really moves, eh? - You could say that, yes.
and your top speed?
with twelve cylinders and pure alcohol fuel
and a gaggle of rockets raring to go,
the old bus could hardly be described as a slowcoach.
this job is designed with front- and rear-wheel drive
as well as direct fuel injection slap in the jet
using the cantilever method.
and I've installed two speedometers
serially linked so that one takes over when the other registers maximum.
and then this rotary wind-gauge . . . - And what about this brake-block?
same system as on a bike, but reinforced.
and what's this device? - That's blood type Rhesus B Plus.
and Rhesus Minus, and a dash of blue blood if we should bump into a baron.
or some other aristocrats. - Very smart.
how about a look at the cockpit?
no. That wouldn't interest the public.
top secret, maybe? - Um . . .
well, it only remains for me to wish Rimspoke every success in the race.
thanking you.
and now our local band will conclude this ceremony
with a specially composed march, Cantata Opus Two,
by pig farmer Archibald Skrimshank.
but first a special welcome to another prominent visitor, Emanuel Desperados.
private chauffeur, born right round the last bend of the Limpopo River.
he has kindly consented to assist in the role of guest drummer.
and now you can see Sheikh Abdul Ben Bonanza arriving in his Rolls-Royce
driven by Emanuel Desperados.
this great magnate is the owner of Aladdin Oil.
there's an air of excitement here as we await the start of this epic encounter
between the world's leading drivers.
now here's No. 3 coming up to start. The Italian Ruffino Gassolini,
known as the Turin Daredevil, in his Bertone Carabo.
no. 12 is the German Heinrich von Schnellfahrt, in his red Abarth 2000,
the celebrated speed-merchant with glass-eye and monocle.
here's No. 5, the Swede Ronny Turnip Anderson,
the Gothenburg Gogetter, followed by No. 8, the Argentine Carlos Fandango.
the pampas playboy who ran slap into a wall and escaped without a scratch.
an impressive array of horsepower.
there's one question of special interest to fans: has Aladdin Oil acted wisely
in staking money and prestige on a mere cycle-repairer?
I imagine the people in Pinchcliffe
will follow today's event with special attention to their hero.
let's have a closer look at Aladdin Oil.
Rimspoke is just leaving the pits.
what competition can his home-made design, Il Tempo Gigante, offer?
it seems hardly likely that an prototype built by a cycle-repairer
will go the full 25 laps of today's gruelling Grand Prix.
but during yesterdays acceleration test Il Tempo Gigante showed a speed
that ensured it a surprisingly good starting position.
in the Snake Oil pit the director of the Dry Rot and Fungus Control Authority
and ace driver Gore-Slimey is behind the wheel of his Boomerang Rapido.
Rudolph Gore-Slimey has a string of victories in his car,
with a great many hush-hush features.
only a handful of intimates know what's concealed beneath the black bonnet.
his co-driver, in a cockpit designed on Spitfire lines, is Eleaser Cassandra,
whose gift of second sight has proved invaluable in a tight corner.
less is known of Theodore Rimspoke's co-driver, Sonny Duckworth.
two novices to the track that should be watched with interest.
in 30 seconds from now this impressive pack of speed-hungry roadsters
will be streaking across the line in the Grand Prix of the Century.
they're off! The home-made contraption already seems to be in trouble.
this is bound to be a severe disappointment to Aladdin Oil.
the German Heinrich von Schnellfahrt in his Abarth 2000 has taken the lead,
closely pursued by the Italian Ruffino Gassolini and Gore-Slimey.
but now it looks like they've managed to crank Il Tempo Gigante into action.
she seems to be firing on all twelve cylinders.
she's off, and good luck to her. She's got a lot of leeway to make up.
not a very encouraging start for the good people of Pinchcliffe.
it does really look as if Rimspoke is putting his best foot forward.
Gore-Slimey in the lead followed by McQuick, the Swede and Gassolini.
in a moment they'll be completing the first lap.
Gore-Slimey has been passed by the Irishman McQuick.
here they come. Gore-Slimey flashing past still in the lead.
with nine laps to go, Rimspoke is lagging 30 seconds behind the leaders.
he has a lot of ground to make up.
and now the Argentine ace Carlos Fandango goes into the lead.
and now it looks as if Rimspoke really has got his horsepower harnessed.
by my stopwatch he's pulled in as much as 15 seconds on his first lap
which is sensational. We should not write off Aladdin Oil's chances yet.
Gore-Slimey once again in the lead with Nos. 4, 12, 3, 8 and 5 in hot pursuit.
followed by Rimspoke. He must have put in a tremendous burst!
Rimspoke's backers are clearly elated.
the wee chappie now facing the camera is one of Rimspoke's rusty assistants.
no doubt his first visit on a race-track.
a popular feature in this tough competition.
a message: Would the owner of the car registered PP 14U2
parked on a manhole outside Entrance C kindly remove his vehicle,
as a Drainage and Water Board inspector is anxious to return home.
we are just coming up for another lap. And Gore-Slimey is still in the lead.
amazing what Rimspoke is getting out of his car.
can he really keep going?
Rimspoke has now rejoined the bunch, and Schnellfahrt answers with a spurt.
Rimspoke's giving all his got, but seems to be having trouble with his engine.
he's falling back. But he's picking up again
and is hot on the heels of McQuick, Gassolini and Anderson.
going into the hairpin bend we get a ding-dong struggle
between Schnellfahrt and Rimspoke.
out of the bend we have Gore-Slimey and Rimspoke.
Rimspoke must have gone into a bit of a skid. His car seems a bit stern-heavy.
there's a dramatic tussle going on, with Gore-Slimey still in the lead.
and there goes Rimspoke, shooting into the lead. Aladdin Oil
is leading in the Grand Prix!
il Tempo Gigante passing the stands with a clear lead.
but it sounds like she is misfiring?
the subsequent order is Gore-Slimey, Fandango, Schnellfahrt, Gassolini
and the Swede Turnip Anderson.
Rimspoke is clearly in trouble. His engine is definitely labouring.
Gore-Slimey is coming up hand over first.
now he's passed him and is in the lead again!
things seem to be going disastrously wrong for Rimspoke and Aladdin Oil.
Rimspoke is being overhauled by the rest of the field. My, what a pity.
after such a splendid performance by this unusual vehicle!
but that's the wa y things go! Snake Oil first with the German second.
just behind these two comes Fandango. The field's spreading out now.
and here's the Swede leaving the pits after a spot of trouble.
but Il Tempo Gigante is obviously in still greater trouble.
she is being taken hand of by her team of mechanics.
now the German seems to be making a bid. Fandango breathing down his neck.
the field seems to be massing for a thrilling attack on the leaders.
Rimspoke is really back in the race!
talk about a quick start! Nothing like it since the Apollo went into orbit.
driver and co-driver must have been subject to something like 3G!
once again Rimspoke challenges the cream of the world's racing drivers.
this can develop into something truly spectacular!
looks as if Aladdin Oil have called on their second driver. What a gamble!
Gassolini holding on to a slim lead, closely followed by the others.
what about Rimspoke and his new second driver?
it's obvious that II Tempo Gigante is now performing superbly.
Rimspoke is closing in on the field.
but Gore-Slimey has pulled ahead and has a clear lead.
Gore-Slimey has a commanding lead, and passes . . . there.
the rest of the field is nicely bunched, with the German in front.
but Rimspoke is now only seven seconds behind the German.
Rimspoke, clearly full of go is only 15 seconds behind Gore-Slimey.
it's going to be hard to predict the winner.
things are really hotting up. The German is back in the lead
with the others breathing down his neck.
il Tempo Gigante is putting on a terrific spurt and catching up!
it's a neck-and-neck struggle between Gore-Slimey and Theodore Rimspoke.
Gore-Slimey is just hanging on to his lead,
but the others are hard on his heels.
Gore-Slimey and Rimspoke are leaving the rest of the field inexorably behind.
now what's happening? Gore-Slimey pulls away.
Rimspoke is in trouble, with Il Tempo Gigante threatening to disintegrate.
Gore-Slimey is starting on the last lap. But where is Rimspoke?
there! He seems to have got his engine going full blast once again !
Gore-Slimey can't be sure of victory. Both cars being squeezed to the limit.
this is the last and decisive lap, and a final maximum effort is called for.
this speed must be a terrific strain on chassis, engine, tyres,
and the drivers themselves.
here things are really getting dramatic. Il Tempo Gigante is enveloped in smoke.
is she on fire? A highly dramatic finish!
Rimspoke comes out of the bend with Gore-Slimey scraping his exhaust.
he flashes across the line there! Winner of the Grand Prix of the century!
in third place the German, followed by the Argentinean, Irishman and Italian.
what a race, what a finish, and what a triumph for our village cycle-repairer
and a sheikh who staked his reputation and money on his intuition.
we congratulate Pinchcliffe, the native village of the three worthies
who ensured Il Tempo Gigante such a sensational triumph.
the cup and the laurels were just one more incident
in the lives of Theodore, Sonny, and Lambert.
they'll be back at their daily chores tomorrow, with petty quarrels,
inventions and the manufacture of flagpoles for the Swiss Navy.
tonight you have the inside berth! - Can I?
is that really possible? - Take the inside when I tell you to!
goodness me!
Snitchery pooh.
Nighty! - Nighty!

[ laughing ] I was married in 1 942.

Yes, if he hadn't fallen off the Staten Island ferry...
irving and I would now be married 50 years.
I said, " Irving, get away from the rail "
Dougie?
airport? Take the 59th Street Bridge definitely.
look, Ahmed, I'm rather skeptical. It's just that the last belly dancer you sent me wasn't quite as slender as I would have hoped.
no, the word " belly " could have applied to any part of her anatomy.
it's not possible. [ Doug ] Ahmed. Ahmed, you're shrieking.
[ mumbling ] - I have an open mind, Ahmed.
it's just that a dancer should have legs. Duck! Duck!
[ whispering ] Do something
okay, Ahmed, I'll tell ya what. Bottom line here.
you don't start treating me right, I'm taking my business to Gemal.
Yeah, I'm aware of the blood feud, Ahmed. I don't care. Salaam alaikum. Milton.
Milton, the Ringos have been in their room for an hour. We want it done right.
two trips if you have to. These people do not have time for you to build the pyramids.
milton Glickman has never made two trips in his life and never will.
the Duchess of Windsor, 1948, 41 pieces, one trip.
John Barrymore, 1941 ...
38 pieces including Mr. Barrymore...
drunk as a lord, one trip. Drunk as a lord, one trip.
the Who, 1975-- Just get the bags to the room before they check out.
167 pieces. One trip.
I spoke to the union. You were wrong. I am allowed to FIRE that senile old idiot.
Really? Did you speak to Miss Tantorelli at the Brooklyn office?
I want him out. Look, Mr. Himmelman, you can't fire Milton.
he's been here forever. A hotel is more than just facilities and amenities.
are you trying to tell me how to run a hotel? - No, sir. Would never do that.
I'm just saying that the Bradbury's like a family.
it's a place where you have an eccentric old bellhop or a hotel manager that charges...
thousands of dollars in personal long-distance phone calls to the hotel.
doesn't mean we want that family member fired... or in jail.
because that would be upsetting to the family. You understand?
Yes, you might be right, Duck.
happens.
Hey, Vincent, what's happening in your sordid little world today?
divorce court. [ woman ]...to the most fabulous city in the world...
and your idea of a second honeymoon is sitting in a dark room eating a tuna sandwich.
[ man ] I'm just about ready to go, honey.
where? Back to the room to watch wheel of Fortune? I came here to fall in love again.
all you wanna do is fall asleep.
it was a very good sandwich. Thank you.
he's doomed, Dougie. The rube's marriage is doomed.
Yep. Them hicks have difficulties:
when to plant things, which shirt to put on the scarecrow; pressure builds up.
well, there's nothin' we can do about it.
Dougie, I'm just a bartender. You're the concierge.
Hey, he seemed like a nice guy.
Yeah, well, that nice guy left you a half a buck tip.
you save his marriage. Dougie! You kept me and the missus out of divorce court!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[ man ] Sixteen dollars for tuna fish?
[ woman ] Harry, will you stop talking about tuna FIsh?
not when it costs more than my shoes. - There you are, sir.
I have those tickets for you. Tickets?
the tickets you called about. Now I could only get fourth-row orchestra. I'm sorry.
miss Saigon is very tough to get at the last second. I made reservations for dinner...
at the Rainbow Room; Gigi the maitre d' is expecting you.
and as per instructions, the hotel limo will pick you up at the theater.
why, Sparky, you really had me going.
Oh, my God. I can't go to the Rainbow Room with my hair like this.
ask for Kenneth. He does Ivana.
thank you.
well, you came through like a pro. How'd ya know?
I'm the concierge. I know everything.
you do your job very well. She hasn't called me Sparky in a real long time.
look, I don't know exactly how to do this, but, uh
uh, look, don't confuse yourself with all these little denominations.
you wait until I'm the best friend you ever had. Then you give me a tip so big...
it feels like passing a kidney stone. Ow. That bad, huh?
if I'm worth it. [ Phone Ringing ]
excuse me... Sparky.
[ ringing ] - Concierge.
Dougie, it's Jeanette Vigusian. Yes, Mrs. Vigusian?
from the newsstand? - Yes, I know, Mrs. Vigusian.
have you got a minute? No, I don't.
you don't have a minute? Yes, Mrs. Vigusian. I have a minute.
I thought so. Everybody has a minute.
uh, Mrs. Vigusian-- - what about settling down, Dougie?
marriage, children-- Okay, I will. Thanks, Mrs. Vigusian.
over there by the fern. - Settle down over there by the fern.
with her... over there by the fern.
Oh, good idea, Mrs. Vigusian. I'll marry her. Good.
Thanks.
some sweet? No?
check this out. That's the new Julian Russell girl.
hottest designer, hottest model. Not many guys have their fantasies come true, Doug, but today I get mine.
look, you know how risky this is, right? I could get fired.
I really owe you. And I'm really gonna collect.
you speak to your boss yet? Sure, sure. He says he wants to meet with you.
you showed him the proposal? The guy gets 50 a week.
he's not gonna write a blank check because some bellhop thinks he has an idea.
I'm a concierge. Four years ago, Hanover found Julian Russell and he
schlepping suits in the garment district for 75 bucks.
now Julian Russell is the fourth small business Hanover's turned to gold since 1 985.
you did your homework. Yeah, well, I
now you be a good boy.
I need that room back by 2: 00. No problem.
[ clears Throat ]
Hey, Doug, look, I forgot something.
I was supposed to pick up some package at Barney's for Mr. Hanover.
it's a present for his wife. Jesus Christ.
come on, Doug. This could be your last day as a bellhop. - Concierge.
[ sniffing ]
I can't tell a thing. It's all confused with the other scents.
perhaps on your wrist. Perhaps not. Lend me an ear.
what?
[ sniffing ]
too woodsy.
would you like a second opinion?
could you? Sure. Miss?
[ sniffing Deeply ]
[ laughing ] [ Snorting ]
you're absolutely right. You might as well glue a pinecone back there.
Oh, woodsy, I'm not. No, no. Top of my head, I would say...
that you were, uh-- Ah, miss, a bottle of Joy deJean Patou, please.
my girlfriend wears this. Now she's about your age.
well, actually, she's not your age. She'll be 38 in June. You're probably 34.
anyway, Joy is what she wears, and I gotta tell you.
that heady musk, [ Inhales Deeply ]
spicy experience...
tempered by a sweet innocence...
has this boy rooting and foraging morning, noon and night.
[ inhales, Sighs ]
you be careful.
she'll help you with that.
you are some piece of work. Hey, I got her out of your face, didn't I?
rooting and foraging " ? tell people what they want to hear, you can sell 'em anything.
what a lovely thought. Now here's a lovely thought: you, me, Friday night...
miss Saigon, fourth row, on the aisle. Doug, don't start.
I'm not goin' through this again.
I've got a boyfriend. - You know, you've used that excuse a number of times.
well, it's handy, and it's true. I hope this guy treats you okay.
Why? Does he?
on and off. Lately?
we spent last weekend in Saint Bart's. - Don't look tan. Rained out?
no, Doug, wejust never made it out of the room. "
all right, I'm gonna come back when I'm older, richer and married.
that way, you won't be able to resist me. Never said he was married.
listen, I've gotta go.
he's married.
Gary, you were suppose to be out of there an hour ago. I got newlyweds comin' in at 5: 00.
Doug, I did it. Oh, spare me the details.
no, I made the call. The big man will be here tomorrow.
yes
and I trust everything was satisfactory, miss?
Thanks.
[ clearing Throat ]
[ snorting ] Hey, Freddy, why don't you take the old girl home...
and give her a rest, huh? Old girl? This is
GypsyJill. Ran at Belmont. Won at Belmont.
what were you smokin' that year? Let me see. Sixty-six, uh

Milton, you're suppose to be in 302 getting their luggage.

but they all disappear
from view
and I only have eyes For you
Hmph Hmph That was great.
Really? What did you think?
uh, well, I thought that that really sucked.
[ laughing ] [ Gary ] That's not true. You have a nice touch, sir. Really.
shut up, Gary. Christian Hanover.
Douglas Ireland, sir. I really appreciate you meeting me.
Christian, please. You know, it's great to be back at the Bradbury.
I proposed to my wife in this very bar.
I think she only said yes to get me stop playing that song.
[ laughing ] That's very funny. Gary, don't you have to go...
and seeJulian at the agency? That's, uh, next week.
well, leave now.
Yes, sir. Uh, Doug, take good care of my boss.
so, uh, Christian, can I get you a coffee, somethin' to drink?
my room. Gary did mention it.
uh, yes, absolutely. Please follow me.
I'll tell you what you're thinking.
'why does a guy who makes that much money need me to comp him a room? "
no, sir. I mean, uh, that's none of my business. I'm making it your business.
two reasons. I value discretion, Doug.
I didn't get where I am by letting everyone know my every move.
two: I wanted you to be in the position of doing me a favor...
cause I've done one for you by coming here today.
it's a small thing, but it's important between men.
we stand equal going in.
shoot, Doug. Bang-bang.
what price can you put on a dream?
I hope it gets better than this.
well?
uh, what price can you put on a dream? A hotel...
is more than a place where you eat and you sleep; it's a place where dreams come true.
I'll just skip ahead to the next section.
okay, here it is without the poetry.
a hotel like none that has ever existed, and it's already built, in here.
two years ago, I got a tip on an incredible property on Roosevelt Island.
middle of the East River, best views of Manhattan. I got a two-year option for 40 grand.
now that's every tip I've made in the last five years. I got one month to get this rollin'...
or it's goin' back to the city, and I'm screwed. - How much to get it from here?
three million dollars to start. Now before you say no, sir, I sketched out...
some start-up figures and it's foolproof; just read this.
nothing is foolproof.
zoning approval? Contingent upon a small public park in the southeast corner.
budget will reflect current building code requirements. - Handicap ramps, bathrooms.
the city signed off on G-1 1 1 minimums? Pending.
what's a G-1 1 1 minimum, Doug?
well, that's the minimum G-1 , uh... It's made up, Doug.
that's the G-1 1 1 " no bullshit clause, " sir. - Exactly.
[ knock At Door ] That's probably the day maid.
actually, I'm expecting someone. She's not my wife, partner. Enough said?
more than enough. We'll be an hour or so.
I'll take the prospectus when I go. - Thank you, sir.
and may I once again-- Open the door.
Doug. Hi.
honey, meet Doug. Hi, honey.
you look sensational.
send up a liter of mineral water.
you got it, partner.
Doug, uh, could I get some advice? Don't want what you can't have.
I mean, I just want to buy some clothes.
Yeah, sorry, Mr. Wegman. Um, absolutely.
what do you have in mind? I don't know. I thought maybe a sports jacket...
some colorful shirts; Mrs. Wegman thinks I
women. Who knows what they want? Oh, I know what they want.

here, try this. Xena on fifth. Ask for Rick.
tell him I sent ya. Great. Thanks.
Doug? You okay?
top of the world.
[ elevator Dings ]
thank you, Doug. Uh, not a problem, Mr. Hanover.
Christian. Please.
you'll see that she-- The hotel limo will take her wherever she needs to go.
very good.
uh, you will, uh
I'll, uh, I'll look it over today.
thank you.
thank you.
she's a lovely girl, isn't she?
what girl?
very good, Doug. So long, my friend.
[ Doug Knocking ] Miss Hart, I have a car waiting for you.
I need the room. My supervisor wants to know why I'm behind.
you want me to tell her?
Marie, Marie, Marie, what do you need? Basketball you hate.

Oh, get a life. I'll just tell my supervisor.
MetslDodgers box seats. What do you know?
had 'em all the time. Amazing.
you'll enjoy that. It's blackmailer appreciation night.
[ door Opening ]
Oh, Jesus. It's okay. He left ten minutes ago.
I'm looking for my lipstick.
Yeah, well, buy a new one. Ball's over, Cinderella. I need the room.
this isn't what it looks like. It never is.
what's that suppose to mean? -Just forget about it, okay? Get your stuff together.
no, I won't forget about it. What did you mean?
it's not what it looks like? Let me guess why. He loves you. You love him.

correct. There's no problem. Mr. Drinkwasser assured us...
that the hotel is not a subject of inquiry; only you, Duck.
so I told him I would gaily cooperate. I'm glad you found a new friend.
Mmm, yes, Duck. What times we had.
but he seemed particularly interested in a deduction you've been claiming...

you kind of took me by surprise, you know.
I'm sorry. Where is he?
I told ya. I really wanted a Slurpee. No. Really.
he said he was very sorry that he couldn't make it, and he was absolutely... forlorn...
and he had to, uh-- Did he go to the country?
Yeah. He went directly from the office. His wife's in the country.
no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
no, he went to the country. His wife went to, uh, a different country.

so that when you went out there, you weren't... reminded of her.
he's alone out there. Yeah, and forlorn.

Hey.
now what? I don't know.
no fresh excuse from Christian? No, not that I know of.
so what are you doing here? Jack Daniels, rocks, please.
it's a free country. I took the car back to the hotel, and it occurred to me...
that Christian might be late. Above and beyond the call of duty.
he should be along any minute anyway. Of course, he will.

Hi, Harry Wegman. How are you? Doesn't he look good?
you look good. [ Doug ] You look good. How did Mrs. wegman react?
she, she laughed. - That's not good. How long have you been married?
this is our 20th anniversary. well, did it ever occur to you that she actually likes you just the way you are?
Hey, didn't you say you wanted to dance? - Uh, yeah.
why don't you two get out there and give Mrs. wegman a wake-up call?
come on, Harry. - Okay. Thanks.
I'm sorry. You're doing fine.
Yeah. Which one's your wife?
she is that very beautiful woman right there.
[ Andy ] The incrediblyjealous one?
Yeah.
you got a great guy there. He's made a very big effort for me.
that's what Doug does. It's his job.
he makes a living out of being nice to people who might give him something in return.
that's funny. I never got that impression.
I guess you know him a lot better than I do. Not really.
well, I may be naive-- I am naive, definitely.
but he's, he's gone way out of his way to help me with my little situation.
you don't do that for money. That comes from the heart.

you can take it at the bar. Thank you.
guess who? ...upside down
Hello? Sweetheart, it's me. I'm so sorry.
Julian locked himself in the storage room with the entire collection.
it took me hours to coax him out again. Anyway, I'm out of here in half an hour.
I'll meet you at our suite at the Bradbury. Hmm?
Oh, right. I'll call Doug and get him to set it up.
uh, he's here. Yeah?
well, he saw you were going to be late, so he stayed to keep me company.
he's a terrific baby-sitter. Put him on.
okay. Christian.
Hey, Christian. How's the man? The man is busy.
listen, take Andy back to the Bradbury and put her in our usual suite.
I'll meet her there. Got it? Yeah, I got it. I'll take care of it.

great.
I'll get the check.
I'm sorry about what happened back there.
nothing happened.
well, no, I mean, nothing happened...
but, you know.
I don't know.
what happened was that you got your deal. Congratulations.
Thanks. You too.
I mean, you and Christian, it looks like that's gonna work out.
Uh-huh.
look, all I was saying was I'm glad that he called when he called...
and nothing crazy happened, and we didn't
nothing crazy was going to happen.
I don't know what you think, but nothing was close to happening.
okay.
well. Well.
so I can open this champagne now...
or would you like to wait for Christian? I'll wait, thanks.
music? No, I'll wait for Christian.
would you like me to turn down the bed? - Why not?
will that be all then, miss?
that's it? That's all you have to say? What would you like me to say?
Oh, I forgot. You don't say a thing unless Christian tells you to
you're like his houseboy, for Christ's sake
well, if I'm his houseboy, what's your job description?
damn you.
what's up, Doug? Hey, how you doing?
everything all right? You look a little upset.
uh, yeah, I'm fine. It was just a long day.
Where's Andy? Resting.
Oh, my lawyers assure me they can work out our problems with the I. R.S.

we're in business, partner.

I know that, but they're vulnerable now.
their oil is drying up, their coal will be gone soon...
and without their power station, Men-Tel has no power.
look, John...
I know you've done more for the resistance than anyone could ask...
but we need your help again.
taking out that power plant would be a big win for us.
what are you talking about? You can't win.
they control everything and everyone.
I told you this was a waste of time. Let's get outta here.
you have no right to even be here. - No?
how long do you think it will be before they find you here?
there where are you gonna hide?
it'll be dark soon. May be you should go.
you said we were done with the boat. - Just get in, Stanley.
I'd feel a whole lot better if you were coming with us, John.
Yeah, me too.

we fought together in Mexico.
what if she's right? What if Men-Tel finds us here?
we'll move again.
I don't want Danny to spend his whole life running.

you know, you're never going to see her again.
Yes, I will.
or I'll die trying.
what's the status of my favorite fugitives?
the latest recovery team was detained...
by local authorities north of the border.
a further incursion could result in a formal complaint to the embassy.
I don't care.
she's an escaped convict, a multiple breeder.
her illicit offspring is the property of the Men-Tel Corporation.
this will not be over until they're all here.
one big, happy family.
I really need to talk to you.
I'm sorry about last night.
just once I wish someone would feel about me the way you feel about your wife, you know?
what are you doing?
I'm going out in the container.
you're nuts. You'll suffocate in there.
I won't be in there long enough to suffocate.
I'm gonna hijack the shuttle as soon as it leaves the station.
using what?
help me grab his weapon. - Load 'em up.
what's wrong with your encoder? This goddamn thing won't work.
you can't talk to her like that. - All I said was "damn.
you said "goddamn." - Don't let it happen again.
or we'll report you. - Report me?
are you two sniffing paint up here? You better sort your shit out fast.
good as new.
like taking candy from a baby.
Jogn, think. What if you're caught?
I don't have any choice here.
teller's after my wife and son...
and he's going to get them unless I get to them first.
are you gonna help me or not?
cover me up.
Where's Brennick? - Still packing.
what are you looking at? Help her. - Yes, sir.
I got it. Here we go.
watch it. - Right this way.
let's go.
what was that? - Pull it out.
it's just - Pull it out!
let's go!
open it. I said open it, goddamn it!
Oh. There it is. Sorry.
it's just my encoder.
do we have a problem?
no, sir. No problem.
miss Combs, do you have any idea what it costs to keep prisoners just standing round idle?
113. 5 credits per prisoner.
a rhetorical question, ZED. Thankyou.
you're welcome.
just try to keep things moving.
you heard the man. Seal it up, and let's go.
shit.
did you really think it would be that easy?
but thank you for pointing out the defects in our security.
you two? Fired. Mr. Gordon.
cut all the prisoner's rations in half...
and double their work day.
thank you.
what do I do with him?
put him in the hole.
move!
you caught Brennick trying to escape?
I suppose you've called up to congratulate me.
now tell me what happened.
what happened is I've got Brennick cooking in the box...
like a Honey baked ham.
I shipped enough reflector plates...
to create a downlink the size of Rhode lsland.
I'm on target to beat our transmission date.
so is it so hard to say "well done"?
fine. You did a good job. What next?
I'd quite like to finish the other generator.
would you get serious?
it won't cost you a dime. I have all the labor and materials I need right here.
al I'll need from you is an electronaccelerator.
what for?
well, I'll be able to use it...
integrate the two generators.
we'll be able to quadruple our power output overnight.
you know as well as I do there's no such thing as too much power.
I can't disagree with you there.
go ahead. Knock yourself out.
do give my love to Daddy.
my man, question.
is it warmer than this up in the hole?
would you like to find out?
asshole.
quit using up all the hot water.
Danny asleep? - Why? Feeling bashful?
I won. I beat you, Dad.
what are you talking about? You can't win.
they control everything and everyone.
I'm not leaving without you.
shall I release him from the hole?
he's already exceeded normal life expectancy by seven hours.
show me Brennick.
why, suppose he's about done.
all right. Get him out.
keep it moving.
I've got a tug full ofwater waiting for you jerk-offs to finish.
I thought you might be dead. - No such luck.
tell me about it. - Mind your own business.
first of all, this is my business.
we're working round the clock because John got a hankering to see his wife.
at least he had the courage to try.
what the hell's that supposed to mean?
it means he cares about someone other than himself...
which is more than I can say for you.
I ain't see no fan mail come down here for you, either!
instead of arguing with each other...
maybe we should be trying to find a way out of this place.
Yeah. Before things get anyworse around here.
there's a contusion on the subject's right patella.
there's a small abrasion on the subject's lefthip.
there's still some evidence of dehydration...
but the effects of hypothermia have almost disappeared.
there is some residual skinblemishes...
resulting from cosmicradiation burns.
there are no other apparent malfunctions.
prisoner number 27609...
you are authorized to return to the workforce.
have a nice day.
Mr. Karensky would like a word with you.
I'm listening.
Mr. Karensky feels your escape attempt has done us all a great disservice.
Mr. Karensky believes you are now indebted to him for the additional hours we all have had to work.
Mr. Karensky believes that the woman will be fair recompense for the inconvenience you have caused.
she is not mine to give.
then perhaps...
you can take her place.
that's flattering, but I think I'll pass.
what did they want? - Something about relations.
international relations.
it's no joke, John.
those Russians will cut your heart out just to see the look on your face.
I don't think it's my heart they're interested in.
Jesus! If you don't get the dirty, filthy thing out of here
I told you keep that sucker outta my food!
I tried. He won't eat it. - He's eating something.
look at the size ofthat motherfucker. - Knock it off.
It'sjust a bug.
bug, my ass. Roachzilla, maybe.
you notice anything funny about those security cameras?
Yeah.
they're not even focusing on what we do.
then how do they monitor us?
I tell you one thing. You better figure it out before we have to learn how to say "I'm your bitch" in Russian.
I'm Dr. Preminger.
today's topic... Learning to love your self.
I would like each and everyone of you to take a good look at the wonder
would you please shut up?
at least you didn't have to listen to that while you were in the hole.
reach down and grab - Yo, shut up! - Partner, she can't hear you.
every god damn day. Shut up!
feel better now? - Yeah, it was worth it.
what's that? - A frequency modulator.
that's a channel changer to you.
why would they need a channel changer if they've only got one channel?
all right, ladies and gentlemen. Step on out.
let's move it. We have a lot of work to do.
I need you to listen up.
not you.
what's up? - Boss wants him on hard labor.
this whole area needs to be completed.
we need the wires repositioned and the wall panels put back up.
so listen up.
you know the drill.
been waitin' a long time for this!
you're a dead man. Really. A dead man.
unauthorized physical contact is a violation.
shall I suspend behavior modification?
you're learning.
behavior modification suspended.
hold it!
how do you wanna go?
look out!
guess that makes us even.
even, my ass. What the hell happened down here?
you know what happened. Where were you?
on my break. You got a problem with that?
and where was ZED?
my apologies. We've been experiencing some technical difficulties.
I'm sure all these problems will be eliminated shortly.
Hey, Colonel Sanders. I heard you fried that redneck motherfucker.
where are the others? - They down at the snack shack.
it's all-you-can-eat lobster tonight.
what do you want, bozo?
food, not this shit.
how bad do you want it?
Hey, Kev. Come here and look at this.
Bezinsky and Sato. This ought to be good.
what are you working on? - A remote.
where did you get it? - The tuner I got from the TV.
the keypad and stuff I got from the new work area.
go sit down.
if not for this, I'd tear off your head and shit down your throat.
would you suspend behavior mode on 27321, please?
my pleasure, Mr. Sato.
behavior modification for prisoner 27321 has been suspended.
your move, bozo.
let's get outta here.
pass it from the right wing in to the center.
goal! - There you go.
that's what I'm talking about.
I'm good, man. I'm good.
is that one of those independent films?
kiss my ass.
we tapped into their surveillance system.
are you all right? I heard about what - How do you do that? - Ask him.
you gotta be kidding me. - Girl, you better recognize my skills.
I can build a radio station out of a milk carton and two condom wrappers.
what's up with the Russians? - They're not even watching.
the fight's a diversion.
they're up to something.
damn. It's like they got cameras inside their heads.
what are you doing? Turn it back!
yo, that's me.
kill it. - No doubt.
what's wrong? - The implants they gave us.
they tap into the optic nerve.
they see what ever we see.
that's enough!
you ever touch me again, and I'll kill you.
you got it? - Yeah. I understand you completely.
well, that was entertaining.
come on, Newman. Go for a walk.
with the right parts, could you stitch together some kind of video recorder?
with my eyes closed.
that would be the way to do it.
zed, what's the prognosis on the second generator?
there seems to be ananomaly in the acquisition files.
anomaly? - The output figures...
for the new electron accelerator...
are well in excess of our power requirements.
planning for the future.
I cross-refrerenced the acquisition file with future projections...
and found no relevant data.
I haven't had a chance to file all our future plans as yet.
it's difficult for me to function at full efficiency...
if I don't have access toall relevant data.
now let's get one thing straight here.
I decide what's relevant data, not you.
so don't bore me with these anomalies unless I ask you to.
is that clear?
that's it, guys. We're on playback.
you guys owe me big time.
that scanner chip only has about four minutes recording time.
so everyone listen up.
I'm sorry, man.
doyou think this uniform makes me look fat?
what we have to do first is find a way around ZED.
forget about ZED. What are we gonna do for transportation?
we're going to hijack the Venture Star.
cause it worked so well the last time?- There has to be anotherway.
like what? " Beam me up, Scotty"?
the Russians have a shuttle.
excuse me?
what makes you think they have a shuttle?
because I'm a lieutenant...
with the Russian Federal Security Service.
I have been watching them plot while they're playing chess.
it's an old gulag trick.
most ofwhat they say is garbage...
but when they touch the queen, it's relevant.
pretty hard to crack if you don't know the rules.
then let's talk to them.
I gotta stay undercover, John.
if they figure out who I am...
they'll kill me.
then I'll do it.
your chess stinks.
you have a skill.
I might as well just shuttle...
my pieces off the board.
that's an unusual choice ofwords.
a metaphor, perhaps.
words, they seem meaningless.
but can we escape their consequences?
that's it.
we're on playback. Now we can talk.
you were right. Their shuttle arrives tomorrow.
tomorrow?
man. So what's their plan?
if they had a plan, they wouldn't need us.
so what's our part? - I told them we knew how to bypass ZED.
did it occur toyou that we don't? - Yes, but we've got 24 hours.
all we need are the codes to Teller's office...
and ZED's security casing.
ain't that a bitch? Man, give me back my rag! What's wrong with you?
leave him alone, Marcus. - Leave him alone, my ass.
he's a damn klepto. Look at this shit!
Oh, oh, oh! Fuck! What the f
Newman!
where did you get this? - I found it.
what is it? - An implant. Our ticket home.
Pickitup, ooh, ooh
Pickitup, allright Party over here
party over there
who's the man with the mike in his hand
don't even think about it.
damn thing would quit movin'.
what exactly are we trying to do here? - Don't hurt him!
you better get the hell out of my face. I ain't gonna hurt this damn thing.
just trying to tap into his nervous system here.
Why?
who's the only person on this station that gets edible food?
teller. So? - The roach must be eating something.
can't you get a better picture? - "Can't you get a better picture?
can you do it your damn self?
now let's see what's on the menu.
Ooh, ooh! Allright! Go!
must be the cold water.
I'm going to Teller's office.
don't do anything I wouldn't do.
unauthorized access is a violation.
behavior modification will commence in five seconds.
it's just me, ZED. Suspend.
suspended.
he's at Teller's door.
this is useless. We can't see a thing.
so? - We're just about ready.
we've linked the two transmitters and calibrated the aiming device.
all we need now is the firing pin.
so when does the accelerator arrive?
she's sending it up tomorrow with the next load of prisoners.
she has no idea what we're planning to do withit.
can I help you?
I wouldn't mind getting a piece of that myself.
well, thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Sato.
you can go now.
so hard to get good help these days.
I believe I have already advised you that the new electron accelerator considerably exceeds our power requirements.
now she's sulking. ZED, lock down.
Newman?
Newman's dead.
it was for a good cause, you know.
good cause, my ass. We ain't seen shit!
if that shuttle arrives and we don't have the codes...
the Russians will kill us all.
the Russians will be the least of our problems.
what was that, Stan?
buckle my shoe. Close the door.
Stan, you're a genius.
we didn't have to see the codes. We heard them.
right this way, ma'am.
take me to his office. There's going to be some changes around here.
Susan? - Peter.
I've come up to take over this operation.
you can't.
I've been working on this project for ten years.
my idea to turn the prison into a power station.
my idea to use the convicts as labor.
my idea to tie in the second generator.
you think I'm just going to stand by and let you walk awaywith it?
Peter, until this moment I didn't think you actually had any balls.
too bad they're not as big as mine.
so sit down, shut up and pay attention.
do you think I wouldn't have found out...
about your black op that captured Brennick in Canada?
stalking his wife and son, overriding ZED...
executing inmates.
if anyone else finds out about what you've been doing...
you'll be a resident here instead of the super.
do you understand me? - Absolutely.
good! Then let's unpack that electron thing and show me to my room.
do you remember the first code?
two, three, six. Pick up sticks.
good. The second.
nine, two, four. Open the door.
he's never going to remember. Let one ofus go.
he's the only one who can cross the pain zone without having his brain fried.
no brain, no pain.
you ready?
there you go.
man, this motherfucker's cross-eyed.
gotta be kiddin' me. This shit ain't gonna work.
it'll be fine. Go and get 'em, Stan.
go.
huh? - Unauthorized access.
Kev, check this out. - Behavior modification...
will commence in five seconds.
four, three, two - Oh, forget it.
it's just the nitwit. - Suspended.
I've done levels 432, 659 and 224.
hello. - And I got nothing.
nice. - Not now, you dingbat.
pick up sticks. Pick up sticks.
come on, Stanley. Come on.
open the door. Open the door.
let's go. Paul, get the Russians.
go to heaven.
warning. Warning. Unauthorized entry is a level one violation.
commencing behavior modification. Warning.
warning. Unauthorized entry is a level one violation.
behavior modification... - Get out of the way!
will achieve terminal status in five seconds.
cut the power! - I'm trying!
don't hurt her! She's nice!
one. Administering.
get to the shuttle station now!
come on, Stanley! - Okay. Okay. Okay.
Rivera has that repressive, compulsive thing.
what? - You know, where you have to...
wash your self over and over again.
damn it.
son of a bitch.
okay.
come on! Where the hell are they?
Hey!
we're not going without the others.
Mr. Karensky regrets that we will be unable to accommodate your friends.
but, of course, you understood that. Nikolai?
good-bye, pig!
I got a feelin' that's not a Russian salute.
nice shot, though I say it myself.
Damn! That's the first time I was happy I missed a ride.
don't die on me, Max.
my name is Yuri Rienkov.
abandoned by his colleagues and murdered in cold blood.
heartrending. Don't you think so, Mr. Tubman?
you traitorous son of a bitch. - What in the hell is going on here?
Susan! - That weapon was not authorized.
it's clever, though, isn't it?
a hundred trillion volts of electromagnetic pulse...
powered by vast amounts of Men-Tel's cheap electricity.
and now you've brought me the firing pin.
I can burn any target in the Northern Hemisphere.
gentlemen, let's get this overwith.
let go of me!
I didn't mean for it to end this way, John.
you must be very disappointed.
please!
guess again. - Good-bye, John.
next. - No!
get her off me!
Whoo! That hurt, didn't it? Didn't it?
you bitch!
fuck you!
Mr. Sato, get ZED to restore surveillance.
Mr. Tubman, toss these three miscreants into the hole.
Mr. Gordon, have someone clear this up, will you?
so it was a setup from the beginning, Nestor.
you used me to find Brennick. - Wasn't me. Told you.
you were the closest one to Brennick.
if anybody could lead us to him, it was you.
too bad about the wife and kid though.
you know what? You a real humanitarian, bro.
do I look like your brother, convict?
prisoner number 27609, Brennick, John, W.
file deleted. - Good-bye.
nice and easy now.
look out!
it can't be that hard!
sorry.
zed?
systems check.
an explosion in airlock 17 has compromised...
the structural integrity of that entire sector.
orbital deterioration will become critical in approximately ten minutes.
what? - An explosion in airlock
I heard you. Can you seal off that sector?
the damage to my system precludes me from initiating structural repairs.
sealing doors 16 and 18 will have to be closed manually.
what are you doing? - Trying to get out of this place...
before it blows up.
relax. The construction's modular. ZED can seal up the damaged section.
besides, where areyou going to go?
Brennick, wait! Stay with me.
I'll call my office. They'll send someone to come get us.
and then what? - Then I'll pardon you.
you are gonna pardon me?
no, thanks, lady. - Brennick, wait!
the station's orbit will continue to deteriorate...
until both sealing doors are secured.
sir, the prisoners - Not now.
we have a damaged sector in the new wing.
we'll have to seal it off manually. - Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Teller.
there's an outgoing transmission from sector 17.
outgoing? Retrieve it. - Are you listening to me?
of course, Susan. You want me to send a spaceship up there...
because your stepson tried to kill you...
but a prisoner named Beswick saved your life, right?
it's Brennick, you idiot! - Brennick.
I'll have to get back to you on this. - Wait, wait!
zed, behavior modification...
highest level.
John Brennick.
I'm sorry, but that file has been deleted from the system.
by whom?
you said delete all casualties.
casualties means dead, you cretin!
yo! Wait up!
come on!
Oh, damn! What the hell you do that for?
I'm sorry! I didn't know it was you! - You're lucky it was your head.
listen. Get everyone to the water tank. We're going out on the tug.
zed, why didn'tyou tell me about this?
you instructed me not to report anomalies...
unless specifically requested to do so.
orbital deterioration will become critical in approximately eight minutes.
what? - Have you developed a hearing defect?
unless you want the station to collapse like an egg carton...
you better get up there and seal off the damaged section!
now where you goin'?
I've been hiding from Men-Tel for 10 years.
I'm not gonna let my son grow up that way.
besides, someone has to turn off the lights.
you can't use those up here! You'll pierce the hull!
the last thing I'm worried about is another prick in the hull.
you seal this. I'll start on the other one.
bingo.
look what crawled out of the recycle bin.
don't be stupid. The whole place is about to go down.
Nah.
just you.
lethal dose.
drop your weapon, Sato.
I am not going to let you kill another man in cold blood.
didn't I tell you never to touch me again?
everyone! Keep moving!
zed, show me Brennick!
wait a minute. D-2.
zed? Stop them!
I'm sorry. My system requirements are presently overloaded.
orbital deterioration will become critical in four minutes.
stanley, come on.
I can't, I, I can't
shit! Don't say a word.
stanley, let's go! Let's go. - Come on!
go! - Okay.
Where's Sato and Gordon?
sato is missing, and Gordon is dead. - Damn it!
you get up there and seal it off.
let's go! Keep movin'!
let's go! Get outta here! - Don't look down!
come on, Stanley! Let's go!
he can't just have disappeared.
perhaps he is at the new transmitter. - Patch me through then.
I'm afrraid you will have to do that manually.
you denied me access to the transmitter area six days ago.
because you were reporting everything I did to the Men-Tel Corporation.
reporting is an automatic function.
I have no control overit.
zed, you betrayed me.
Whoa!
you left the water running.
access restored. Find him.
I have located John Brennick in the transmitter control room.
not my gun!
orbital deterioration will become critical in one minute.
help me! - Not now. Brennick's got the weapon.
forget Brennick! We gotta seal the door!
teller, think! The weapon is pointed at Earth!
now what's he gonna do with it? Help me.
total orbital collapse will occur in ten seconds.
the damaged sector has been secured.
orbital stability is being restored.
zed's coming back on-line. We've got to get out of here now.
what about Brennick? - He's dead.
I saw it myself. Teller shot him twice.
look, I'm the president of Men-Tel!
I'm ordering you to get off of this space station now
we're not going anywhere, you bitch.
what the hell's he doin'?
the panels?
it's over, John. Step away from the controls.
get over there!
ten years.
I feel like I know you...
better than anyone I've known in my whole life.
I wouldn't bet on that.
a massive power surge has destroyed all of the station's critical functions.
all personnel must evacuate immediately.
a massive powersurge has destroyed all of the station's critical functions.
all personnel must evacuate immediately.
prisoner number 27609, Brennick, John, W.
you are charged with sedition, sabotage, escape...
with aiding and abetting fugitive identified as Brennick, Karen.
you are also charged with
teller! It's over! Get up the stairs!
you get up there, and you bring him down!
have a nice
prisoner number 27609
you're out of your fuckin' mind!
you traitorous piece of shit!
take my hand! - I'm sorry.
take my hand! - Sabotage, escape
identified as Brennick
I'm losin' it!
we've got him! - Hurry up!
cut it loose!
hold on!
dial the system! - Everybody, hold on!
mom, look.
it's a shooting star. - Ahh.
you can make a wish.
I wish
if you tell anyone, your wish won't come true.
I wish my dad would come home.
take us home.
Oh, Danny, Danny, Danny! - Dad!
monsters From Beyond - Victor, I don't know that it's... - Mom, you have to wear the glasses.
it's 3D, honey. - Oh. Yes, of course.
starring Sparky!
so that's where my candlestick went.
isn't that your grandmother's tablecloth?
Yeah.
that looks great.
Whoa! I just felt like I was attacked!
send in the marines!
over here, men! This way!
Whoa! - Watch out!
enter Sparky saurus - Sparky! - Sparky, that's you!
you tell them, Sparky.
Oh, my!
the End or is it?
Bravo!
maybe just unplug it.
well, it certainly was exciting.
Yeah, it was a big finish. Well done, son.
I can fix this. Come on, boy.
all that time he spends up there.
a boy his age needs to be outside with his friends.
I don't know that Victor has friends, dear. Other than Sparky.
that's my point.
I don't want him to turn out, you know, weird.
there's nothing wrong with Victor. He's just in his own world.
easy, boy.
see you later, sweetie.
have a good day.
Victor! Come on, honey. You're going to be late.
go put Sparky in the back yard.
come on, Sparky!
good morning, Mr. Burgemeister.
your dog has been sniffing around my Dutch Dazzlers.
the other day I caught him peeing on my flamingo.
I'll keep an eye on him.
you better.
Yes, sir.
go on, Sparky. That's right!
good boy. See you later!
mayor TO OPEN DUTCH DAY
where do you think you're going?
school.
what about that dog of yours?
she's not in the house and she's away from your tulips.
I want you to remember something.
while your parents are away, I am in charge here.
Yes, Uncle Bob.
dutch Day is coming up, and I don't need any trouble.
how's your song coming? - Okay.
keep at it!
dutch Day is a big day for me.
Yes, sir.
good morning, children.
I am Mr. Rzykruski.
I will be your new science teacher.
apparently, Mr. Holcomb had an incident.
he got hit by lightning!
well, that is bad.
but he did not get "hit" by lightning.
lightning does not hit a person the way one is hit by a baseball or a cabbage.
lightning is simply electricity.
the cloud is angry. Yes. Making storm.
all the electrons are saying, "I am leaving you!
I go to the land of opportunity!
the ground says, "Yes, we need electrons trained in science just like you!
come. Come! Welcome.
so both sides start to build a ladder.
this man, he comes out to look at the storm.
he does not see the invisible ladders.
when the two ladders meet... Boom!
the circuit is complete and all of the electrons rush to the land of opportunity.
this man is in the way!
but it is very rare to have such an incident.
but it's not rare.
lightning happens to people all the time here.
there's a thunderstorm almost every night.
my dad got hit twice.
they built New Holland on an abandoned gold mine.
I heard it was a cemetery.
that's where they buried the miners.
it's the windmill that does it.
turning, turning the air until the sky itself rages against the night.
no. Cemetery. Definitely.
students, on your way out, take a permission slip for the science fair.
first prize is a huge trophy!
Hello, Victor.
Hi.
Mr. Whiskers had a dream about you last night.
how do you know?
because this morning he made this.
did you get that out of the litter box?
it's an omen.
last month he dreamed about Bob.
he fell in a manhole.
he dreamed about Toshiaki the day he pitched a perfect game.
and Nassor the day he got knocked unconscious.
if Mr. Whiskers dreams about you, it means something big is going to happen.
you can keep it.
one day you'll dream about me, won't you, Kitty?
Hey, boy. How are you doing?
you'll be my partner, right, Victor?
because you have to have a partner for the science fair, and whoever is your partner is going to win.
you know the most about science so pick me as a partner.
I have lots of ideas!
we can make a death ray!
it says no death rays. See?
Oh, man.
I still want to do it. Come on.
who else would be your partner?
you don't have friends and neither do I.
I'm sorry, Edgar. I just don't need a partner.
I like to work alone.
will you sign my permission slip? - Dinner's ready.
Victor, have I ever talked to you about what I do for a living?
you're a travel agent?
I sell dreams.
I tell people, "You can sail to Italy.
you can do the hula in Hawaii.
will you sign my form? - I'm getting to that.
okay.
in my job, sometimes you have people who don't want quite the same thing, right?
say a husband wants to play golf in Scotland but the wife wants to paddle down the Amazon.
all right, you've got two conflicting ideas here.
and it's my job, Victor, to help them meet halfway.
say... Scottsdale, Arizona.
he gets to golf, she gets Indians.
but there's no river. And no jungle.
nobody gets what they want. - Exactly.
and wrong.
they both get what they want because they compromise.
you'd like to do the science fair and that's great.
I'd like you to try a sport. Say, I don't know, baseball.
science fair, baseball. Science fair, baseball.
how do you choose? Guess what? You don't have to.
no reason you can't do both.
you meet in the middle. Everyone's happy.
look at what Toshiaki's doing.
he's keeping his eye on the target, never losing his concentration.
strike three! Next batter!
I want you to concentrate on your project for the science fair.
come on, honey!
whoa. Nice catch, Sparky.
come on, Victor, please.
tie Sparky up and get your head into the game.
time out!
sorry, boy.
Hey, Sparky.
play ball!
strike one!
nice try, son.
when conducting an experiment, trying is the important thing.
it is okay to fail as long as you keep trying!
come on, Victor. You can do it, honey.
strike two!
Yes!
come on, honey!
Victor, run!
Sparky!
Sparky!
No!
he was a great dog. A great friend.
the best dog a kid could have.
when you lose someone you love, they never really leave you.
they just move into a special place in your heart.
he'll always be there, Victor.
I don't want him in my heart. I want him here with me.
I know.
if we could bring him back, we would.
try and get some sleep, sweetheart. Things will seem better in the morning.
just like lightning, the nervous system is electricity.
we are wires and springs and cables to send the messages.
even after death, the wiring remains.
watch as the muscles respond to the electricity.
Hi, Victor! How was school?
okay.
new HOLLAND PET CEMETERY
Sparky
I'm sorry, boy.
you're alive!
you're alive!
Sparky!
you're alive!
I can't believe it! You're alive!
I can fix that.
it worked.
it really worked.
Victor!
Victor, breakfast!
Victor?
are you up here?
quiet down, boy.
Victor?
Sparky...
quiet.
Victor!
french toast or waffles?
waffles.
then I'll need my waffle iron back, Mr. Director.
it's my science project. It's a robot.
a robotic bucket? - Yes.
for mopping, I suppose? - Yes.
maybe when you're finished, you'll let me use it.
sorry, boy, but I can't let anyone know about you.
they may not understand.
so, you need to stay here today.
no, couldn't be.
what?
I know. And Helen said she thought they were putting up some kind of TV antenna on top of the roof.
in the middle of a thunderstorm?
that's what she said.
I don't believe it.
and did you get that big power surge the other night?
Jack thought it was a fuse box, but apparently it affected the whole neighborhood.
sometimes I wonder just what goes on in that house.
I just don't feel safe walking by there.
sweetie, you okay? Here you go.
so anyway, Jack loves it here, but if the schools weren't so great, sometimes I wonder if we'd be better off closer to my mother.
Sparky?
Hi, Victor. How was school? - Good. Got to go.
Sparky?
Sparky?
there you are.
good boy. Sorry you had to stay here alone all day.
what's the matter, boy? Are you okay?
you're a little low.
are you hungry, boy?
all right, here. Let's top you up.
Victor? Could you come down here, please?
Victor!
your friend is here.
Edgar?
hey...
Edgar, what are you doing here?
I know. - What?
I know.
know what? - You know.
no.
I think I know what you know I know.
look, I don't know what you think I know, but I don't know it.
your dog is alive!
that's impossible. - I know.
I know it is so impossible, but you did it.
you did it!
so, show me how, or I'll tell everyone.
Mrs. Frankenstein!
may I have a cookie, please?
Yes, of course.
all right, come on.
I think the wind and the lightning are part of the same thing, some kind of strange force.
but the wind isn't strong enough to bring an animal back from the dead.
for that, you need lightning.
so when can I do it?
you can't. This isn't an experiment. It's my dog.
show-and-tell, Victor.
you show me, and I won't tell.
can I help you, young man?
I'd like to buy a fish.
certainly. Which one?
this one.
what do we do now?
what happened to it? What did you do?
I don't know. It should have worked.
it's invisible. It's an invisible goldfish.
why is it invisible? - I have no idea.
you can't tell anyone. You understand that, right?
not until we figure out how it works.
okay, okay.
promise? - Promise.
how are we supposed to see an invisible goldfish?
put your finger in. You can feel it.
it bit me!
let me see it.
it's my science project, and it's top secret!
yeah? Well, our science fair project is even cooler.
what is it? - Double top secret.
Sea-Monkeys?
we got to come up with something better.
bigger. - I know.
the science fair is in two days.
I know.
you're the smart one! - I know.
okay, okay. Sit still.
Sparky! No! No!
sorry, boy, but we can't risk anyone seeing you again.
Toshiaki says you have an invisible fish.
no, he didn't. - So, you don't?
I didn't say that. Who said I did?
Toshiaki says it's your science fair project.
if it was, I couldn't tell you.
so it isn't, or it is?
no. Yes.
I'm confused.
do you have an invisible fish?
okay.
but you have to keep it a secret.
swish your finger around. You can feel it.
it's just water. There's nothing there.
no, it's invisible.
huh?
I don't know what kind of game you and Victor are playing, but that trophy will be mine.
Victor.
something's wrong with my fish!
what is it? - It's not there anymore.
maybe it just hopped out. Did you have the lid on it?
Yes, ever since...
since I left your house.
I mean, it was there when I went to bed.
I'm thinking maybe they don't last.
they're only there for a little bit and then they're gone.
No! Sparky!
Sparky!
don't worry. I can fix that, too.
good night, boy.
are you sure this is going to work?
no. That's why it's called an "experiment.
we have to collect data.
do we have to collect it on me?
ready? - No.
ten, nine, eight...
we could use a test dummy or something.
seven, six, five...
computer simulation.
four, three, two...
I have to pee! - One.
it's working! It's working!
what were you boys doing on the roof?
science. - Science.
as mayor of New Holland, you have entrusted me with your safety.
so I can't sit idly while a teacher endangers our children.
the man is a menace!
she's right! He's crazy!
have you looked through this science book they're using?
apparently Pluto isn't good enough to be a planet anymore.
when I was a kid, Pluto was a great planet.
this guy comes along and rewrites the rules!
in fairness, he didn't write the textbook.
Mr. Mayor, Edward Frankenstein.
your neighbor, of course.
I just would like to say that our son Victor is just crazy about the new teacher.
thinks he's great.
my Cynthia has been asking all sorts of strange questions about things I've never even heard of.
shouldn't we at least give the man a chance to explain himself?
Yes.
please come up, Mr. Menace.
ladies, gentlemen.
I think the confusion here is that you are all very ignorant.
is that right word, "ignorant?
I mean "stupid," "primitive," "unenlightened.
you do not understand science, so you are afraid of it.
like a dog is afraid of thunder or balloons.
to you, science is magic and witchcraft because you have such small minds.
I cannot make your heads bigger, but your children's heads, I can take them and crack them open.
this is what I try to do, to get at their brains!
Oh, my.
thank you.
Oh, jeez.
be quick, boy. They'll be home any minute.
# Praise be New Holland. #
# Praise be New Holland. #
# Streets so wide and sidewalk... #
the sidewalks. Okay.
# Praise be New Holland. #
No! No!
no, no, no!
Victor?
Victor?
Hi, Elsa. What are you doing?
practicing my song for Dutch Day.
it's nice.
did you get a new dog? - No.
I heard a bark. - Yeah, that was me.
you are barking?
you must really miss Sparky.
I got to go. Bye
Bye.
I feel so sad for him, Persephone.
he really misses his dog.
Where's Mr. Rzykruski?
all I know is I'll be teaching the class for the rest of the semester.
do you know anything about science?
I know more than you do.
Mr. Rzykruski knew a lot.
well, sometimes knowing too much is the problem.
what about the science fair?
it's still on, but it will be judged by someone who's not insane!
me!
now get cracking, and may the best person win!
I can't believe they let the gym teacher be the judge.
she's not even interested in science.
back home, everyone is scientist.
even my plumber wins Nobel Prize.
your country does not make enough scientist.
always needs more.
you should be a scientist, Victor.
nobody likes scientists.
they like what science gives them, but not the questions, no.
not the questions that science asks.
actually, I have a question.
that is why you are a scientist.
I was doing my experiment, my project, and the first time it worked great, but the next time it didn't.
I mean, it sort of worked, but then it didn't.
and I don't know why.
then maybe you never really understood it the first time.
people think science is here, but it is also here.
the first time, did you love your experiment?
Yes.
and the second time?
no. I just wanted it over.
then you changed the variables.
I was doing it for the wrong reason.
science is not good or bad, Victor.
but it can be used both ways.
that is why you must always be careful.
I can't believe I broke my arm for nothing.
none of us are going to win! Edgar has an invisible fish!
no, he doesn't. You fell for a parlor trick.
you're saying he faked it?
that fish you showed us, was it real?
it was, and it was dead, too.
you brought an animal back from the dead?
no, Victor did.
with lightning, and boom, and...
impossible.
I swear! I mean, he already brought back his dog.
he brought back Sparky?
Victor will win the science fair unless we can do better.
bigger.
you say you know Victor's secret?
now is your chance to prove it.
now, where's my muffin tin?
Victor.
Sparky?
Sparky! But you're...
Sparky's alive!
Sparky?
Hey, come on!
mom? Dad? What's going on?
Sparky! No! Sparky!
Sparky, no!
Sparky, come back!
Sparky!
Hey, hey! Just a minute!
No! I have to go find Sparky!
Victor, what have you done?
you said yourself, if you could bring back Sparky, you would!
Yes, but that was different because we couldn't!
it's easy to promise the impossible.
what you did was a very serious thing.
crossing the boundary between life and death.
reanimating a corpse!
it's very... Upsetting.
I just wanted my dog back.
sweet heart.
we'll help you look for Sparky but when we get back, I think we need to have a little talk.
understood?
Yes.
now, let's go find your dog.
Sparky!
Sparky, are you in there?
mom, Dad! I'm going to check the school and the park.
you guys do the town square, okay?
got it.
Sparky!
cool.
interesting.
it has something to do with the lightning.
I don't really understand it.
but I do!
tonight, we shall bring the dead to life!
Sparky! Where are you?
Sparky!
Sparky! Sparky!
thank you. Thank you so much.
and now it's my pleasure to introduce this year's Little Dutch Girl, my niece, Elsa Van Helsing.
I don't think this is safe.
nonsense! We have the fire chief over here.
you know, a lot of girls would kill to be in your place.
I'd welcome death.
# Praise be New Holland #
# Streets so wide and sidewalks clean #
# Modest homes at modest prices #
# Evelyone's hope and dream #
I'm going to win.
no, I shall win the science fair.
# In our houses tight and safe #
# We have nothing to fear #
the tomb of Colossus.
soon you shall be awakened and we shall be reunited once again!
Shelley.
# Praise be New Holland #
# May your windmills spin forevermore #
isn't she adorable?
Mr. Whiskers?
Mr. Whiskers?
Hello!
is someone there?
rise, Colossus.
rise from your tomb!
Shelley?
Shelley?
Sparky!
Sparky!
Sparky?
Sparky?
Sparky!
Sparky, it's okay, boy. It's just me.
I thought that you were gone.
I never want to lose you.
promise you'll never go running off, okay?
come on, boy.
was someone else here?
Victor! I need your help. - Did you see those things?
they were like... - Sea-Monkeys!
you know how on the package, they're like, in a happy kingdom and everyone's smiling?
yeah? - They're not like that at all.
Victor! I need your help. - I asked him first!
my problem bigger!
Yeah, he's right.
okay, let's go!
and now for our next act, we have something really big.
No! Get away!
Oh, no!
this way! In here!
go, Colossus.
kill! Kill!
kill!
Colossus?
get away from me!
get away from me!
your Sea-Monkeys. Are they freshwater or saltwater?
freshwater.
freshwater animals can't tolerate salt.
Hey! Over here!
cool.
help!
get back!
stay away from us!
Sparky!
no, no, no, no!
whoa, stop! You put me down! I gave you life!
Victor! Victor, I need help. Please!
Shelley?
Persephone!
Persephone, are you okay?
here, Mr. Whiskers.
here, kitty, kitty, Mr. Whiskers.
No!
Persephone!
bring her back!
Mr. Whiskers.
I'm coming, Elsa!
what happened?
Sparky! There you are.
are you all right?
what you got there, boy?
let me through!
I knew it. It's the boy's dead dog!
that's Elsa's wig. Where's my niece?
he's killed the little girl!
after him! Kill the monster!
help!
help!
stay away from us!
get him!
Where's my niece?
look out! It's on fire!
there's Elsa!
help!
Elsa!
Sparky!
Victor!
help! - Hang on! Don't let go!
I can't reach!
hang on!
I can't hold on much longer.
Sparky!
Victor!
stay back. It's too dangerous.
that's my son in there!
Victor!
Victor! - Honey, are you all right?
Sparky!
No!
Victor, is there anything we can do for you?
you said that I need to let him go.
sometimes adults don't know what they're talking about.
start your engines!
give it more juice!
turn off your engines!
it's okay, boy. You don't have to come back.
you'll always be in my heart.
Sparky!
you there Tokyo?
Yeah, Tokyo here.
cairo, you hear me? - Cairo rules!
alright Los Angeles is in the house.
alright, let's do it.
hey Newt, maybe this time you don't want to put the grenade launcher under the garage.
says the soldier who kills his own people, right.
lie down next to the doorway, all right, hot shots?
come on. Let's do this.
let's do it, L.A. Come on.
- No!
no, no, no, no, no!
what happened? - We're down.
what happened? What are you doing?
I got kicked offline.
what were you doing?
were you messing with our Internet again?
I was just I. M.'Ing with a friend...
and updating my profile and writing an e-vite.
for the party in your pants?
how dare you? I'm gonna call Gene.
no. Don't call Gene, all right?
just call the-- the-- the heroes of tech.
all right? They're good.
those guys are plumbers.
our system doesn't talk to the tower.
even i can't fix it.
only Gene Toy can keep us on the grid.
guys, I think I'm gonna take off.
no, come on, hold on. - What?
Oh, come on, like you got somewhere to be? - Yeah, I'm gonna head out, too.
come on, come on. Just stick around. We'll play beer Jenga.
Yeah, come on, you guys. Come on. Don't.
if you leave, we'll be alone with each...
maybe it'll come back on.
I optimized bandwidth last week. I don't understand.
streaming porn, music, and live-action gaming, you need the bandwidth of a Vegas hotel.
it's the gaming. - It's not the gaming.
it's definitely the gaming.
gene Toy! How you been, man?
I've been doing some stuff out in Joshua Tree.
I went on a vision quest and had sex for 12 straight hours on a mountaintop in Joshua Tree once.
I would've kept going, but, uh, we were surrounded by coyotes.
is any of that true?
I went to Joshua Tree once.
everything cool now, I hope?
no. I'm moving to Chicago.
what? - Whoa.
you cannot move to Chicago.
what about building your own business?
you can't abandon your dream.
or us.
I'm sorry. It's out of my hands.
this guy accused me of stealing meat from his market.
I didn't, but that doesn't matter in Chinatown.
I know all about C-Town.
it's all Triad and Black Rain.
black Rain was in Japan.
see, when you're accused in Chinatown, you're shunned.
there's no future for me here anymore.
that sucks.
I'm sorry. I, uh, I can't reprogram your grid.
uh, it takes too many man-hours that I don't have.
and I got to pack. I-I'm sorry.
Oh, all right. - We understand, man.
just... - Wow. Sorry!
sorry you can't do what we...
I want to play games.
morning, everyone.
two new cases today.
a former assistant at Stirred is coming in, claiming that she was fired for being -- get this -- too attractive.
stirred? What's... - It's a luxury and lifestyle magazine.
it's for men, so you guys probably haven't heard of it.
Really?
you want to go there, Mr. Mani and Pedis on Saturdays?
um, and, second, the wife of one of our biggest clients has been cited for public urination outside of a Red Lobster.
Oh, well, there you go. That's got "Franklin and Bash" written all over it.
no, we'll take the Stirred case.
okay, sure.
I mean, I've seen the plaintiff. It's a solid case.
but I don't know that you two newbies...
did he call us noobs?
...that you two newbies have the bag to go up against the magazine's founder, Big Mack.
uh, actually, uh, it's his daughter, Katherine, that's running it now.
very sexy. I'd like to see her in the Swimsuit issue.
we'll take the case. And we'll win it.
Ah! Good. - There is no way.
I guarantee it.
you want to put some money on it?
I've seen you eyeballing our ginormous office.
it's almost too big for us.
it's just the two of us. - It's just -- I know.
well, my contract stipulates that I get the second-largest office, so, technically, that office is already mine.
and yet I bring in twice the business you do.
all right, our double-wide office for that sweet guitar in yours.
well, not the Gretsch White Falcon that I got you from Jack White?
no, no, no, you're crazy. Don't.
you want to give up the present from your uncle?
I'm sorry, what were you saying about bag?
deal.
all right.
did you get that?
all right.
we need to find somebody to replace Gene Toy.
we shouldn't have had Pindar cobble together that lame grid.
Oh, man, we could lose our right to host "Killzone" marathons.
it's like losing the Olympics.
I say we go to Chinatown, have lunch, and check out the scene of the crime, see if we can help Gene out.
excuse me.
um, I'm here to meet my attorneys.
red Lobster!
allure by Chanel.
I'm Jennifer Putnam from Stirred.
you're claiming Stirred magazine fired you because you were too hot?
Wow. That's not my word exactly.
but, well, thank you. Yes.
would you excuse us?
Karp! - No, no, no.
what are you doing? - We need to talk.
Hey, hey, stop walking!
you knew she wasn't pretty.
depending on the time of night.
she's last-call pretty.
Yeah. In Alaska. -The bet is off.
you made a verbal commitment in front of witnesses to win the case, so suck it.
uh -- you have awoken the bear, my friend!
ladies.
as assistant to the publisher, what were your responsibilities?
to answer Katherine's phone, keep her schedule, and help plan events, like this weekend's mega-fundraiser.
did she ever say to you you were "too beautiful" to work there?
no, she didn't have to.
the amount of attention I received from the men in the office was overwhelming.
I'm sure.
but we're gonna need specifics.
Oh, uh, well, they swarmed around my desk, held doors for me, followed me off the elevator.
is that specific enough?
you're really staring at me.
it's hard not to.
have you ever modeled? - And gotten paid for it?
Oh, if you walk through this world knowing that you're beautiful, other people will know it, too.
okay, so, I'll -- I'll -- I'll write "no.
if you want, sure.
uh, what do -- what do the other women in the office look like?
they're what I'd call traditionally attractive.
I'm sort of an exotic bird at Stirred.
got it. Okay. Well, we'll take a ride over to the office later and see if there's any shot at a settlement.
Oh, I don't want to settle.
sorry?
I want my day in court.
this isn't just about my job.
this is big.
I'm the Norma Rae of beautiful women.
okay, well, that -- that'll -- that'll do it.
because we need to confer to see if we're actually gonna decide to take your case.
this is gonna be great.
who knows -- we could be in this all the way to the Supreme Court!
this -- -There's a chance.
sure. -There is.
I can't tell if Jennifer is delusional or has the most inflated if self-esteem ever.
I always thought they were one and the same.
your strength and endurance are legendary with oral sex.
I'm supposed to do the punch lines.
??????
we should eat there more often. - I know.
excuse me. - Sorry. Sorry.
thank you.
behind you!
we're, uh -- oh, ho ho!
you all right? We're looking for Mr. Han.
dad! There's some guys here to see you!
Hey. - He stole a rabbit?
may I help you? - Uh, yeah, we represent Gene Toy, and you're gonna have to take that down, 'cause he hasn't been charged with anything and it's defamatory.
it's my store. I do things my way.
okay, sir, what exactly are you accusing him of?
stuffing a frozen rabbit down his pants.
Aw, who hasn't accidentally done that?
I'm sure he had every intention of paying for the rabbit.
he had no receipt.
gene Toy steals from my store, he steals from my family!
you know what I'm thinking?
injunctive relief and force Han to take down these signs?
Absolutely. - Sorry.
but right now? - Palate cleanser.
okay.
here you go, gentlemen.
thank you. - Thank you.
we wouldn't get any work done here.
Mr. Franklin, Mr. Bash.
her claim is unusual, especially considering the other women who work here.
so I'd like to make this quick and easy for everyone.
we're all ears.
Jennifer drops the lawsuit, and, in turn, we provide her with a glowing recommendation letter.
no mention that she was terminated.
Wow. So your settlement offer is a promise not to be mean to her.
Jennifer Putnam wasn't good at her job.
that's why she was fired.
our client disagrees with you, Katherine.
she's never been fired from a job before, and she's got glowing reviews from her past supervisors here at Stirred.
I was her most recent supervisor.
these are performance memos from August on.
I know we can come to a quick resolution.
Hey! How's it going over here? - Dad, I got this.
can we meet Big Mack? Can we just say "hi"?
just to shake the hand of the man who
no, you're just gonna walk away like that, right?
it's nothing. Don't worry about it.
don't do that. Don't. - No?
the next time you're in the end zone, act like you've been there before.
Oh, I never have-- not in an end zone like this.
Holy-- shhh. Give me a minute.
uh, not many women feel comfortable holding eye contact for more than three seconds.
a less worldly man might consider that predatory.
your accent is wonderful!
I bet I can tell where you're from.
Oh. Impossible, darling.
any hometown inflection has been watered down by 30 hard years in Santa Monica.
I hear Dartmoor... and University of Liverpool.
do I know you?
what a lovely young woman.
none of these memos are true.
Katherine had it in for me because I turned down surgery.
Oh, the Stirred benefits package includes plastic surgery.
Katherine says everyone has room for improvement.
and you don't agree with that?
no.
I'm fortunate.
this package has gotten me very far in life.
I just remembered we're supposed to call another client.
Jennifer, could you give us a-a moment, please?
Oh, I get it-- lawyer- client privilege.
that is so cool!
thank you.
we got to get out of this. - How?
it's just always hard to dump a girl.
but the quicker you do it, the less painful for everyone.
the quicker I do it?
you need more practice than me.
No! Infeld will be pissed, Karp will get our office, and you and I will be relegated to defending women who pee outside Red Lobster!
come in. - Is this a joke?
Infeld's going around calling her "captivating.
she wasn't fired for being too beautiful.
she was fired for not being pretty enough.
she was discriminated against but not for the reasons she thinks.
that's a case we can win.
well, good luck telling little Miss Sunshine.
Oh, good lord. Grow a pair.
hit her with the facts and rip off the scab.
I have a pair.
great -- we get to tell a woman who feels beautiful that the rest of the world doesn't even notice her
peeing outside of a Red Lobster, nowhere near a school zone.
we fight this! - Right.
Hi, I'm Jenn.
you know what-- I was gonna get that same dress, but the fabric was a little itchy.
we would have been twins.
I hope someone's complimented you today, because you look so absolutely fabulous.
thank you. Uh, Hanna.
nice meeting you.
we know that a jury...
well, I should say, we've tried a lot of cases, and we... think...
as we move forward... You should-- we should, um... Peter?
guys.
heads in the game, okay? -Okay.
we're gonna take your case because we agree that you were fired...
for being too beautiful, and we're gonna prove it.
we're gonna win.
we're gonna win" on 3.
okay. Come on.
we're gonna win." 1, 2,3. -1, 2,3...
we're gonna win.
we're gonna win!
Oh, certainly. - I know.
stirred sees it as a straightforward termination case.
well, Jennifer disputes the performance memos.
and she has a history at this job and others of being competent and responsible.
her face isn't even symmetrical, people.
beauty is based on symmetry.
my face?
perfectly symmetrical.
had it professionally analyzed.
okay, you can't talk for the rest of the day.
what am I supposed to do? We're still offline.
I don't know. That's all you've got?
insulting our client or-- or firing up porn?
not a big reader.
stirred sells the cool bachelor's life.
what if we sell back?
Ooh, like "The emperor has no clothes.
we make them define beauty.
you feeling injunctively relieved? - No.
get your asses down here. I want to show you something. Now!
he just yelled at me.
Whoa! What is this?
am I really that short?
just the angle.
what does it say under our picture?
unclean rabbit-thief lawyers.
I take issue with "unclean.
my landlord evicted me.
my investment club kicked me out. I'm ruined here.
all right, Gene, Gene, we can fix all this.
no. Can't you see you've done enough harm?
just leave me alone.
gene, you can sue. - No western courts.
don't you get it? This is why I'm in this mess.
well, then, how do you get justice around here?
my only hope of repairing the Toy family name and staying in Chinatown is to land a hearing with the council.
they have all the power.
there's a Chinatown Council? This just keeps getting better.
we want to make it up to you, Gene. Yeah, you can.
stay away from Chinatown.
Gene! Don't... - Damn, man.
are you gonna fix our grid?
last night, I shared an incredibly expensive meal with the mayor.
the nest of the swift bird is built entirely out of her hardened saliva.
any idea where bird's nest soup originated from, 400 years ago?
that's well before my time. - Yeah. I don't know.
okay. This, we can ex-- - Someone had dinner in Chinatown.
a grocery-store owner accused our friend of shoplifting, and we tried to help.
good job on that.
your insensitivity to their customs has made the Infeld/Daniels name unclean.
sorry about that.
we got injunctive relief for our friend so the owner would have to take down a damaging display.
injunctive relief? No wonder!
why not just smear pig feces all over his face in the middle of Chung King Road?
that was plan "B." We were gonna start with...
sir, we've dropped the case, and -- and we're gonna ge last flyer taken down.
every one. - Well, good, but that's not gonna exonerate your friend.
no, he's trying to get some date with the Chinatown Council.
the apocryphal council of elders!
it does exist!
I first heard about this during a game of pai gow in Rangoon in '67.
now, your friend... Must get a hearing with this council.
well, we promised him we'd back off.
Oh, very wise.
you're obviously unschooled in Chinese judicial culture.
no, uh... - Damien and I are taking over the case.
we're going to Chinatown.
we?
well, you- you know I don't parallel park.
and we'll prove it, because Jennifer Putnam is 50-car-pileup beautiful!
let me guess.
miss Sproik has a haughty sneer on her face, huh?
like the only beautiful women are in the pages of Stirred.
but how can that be?
you, ma'am.
your husband thinks you're beautiful, right?
and yet I don't recognize you from any magazines, but that doesn't mean you're not beautiful, because, believe me, you are.
ladies and gentlemen, we'll prove that Jennifer was a great assistant.
and it goes without saying -- but I'm gonna say it anyway -- she is a stunner.
now, her looks may have been disruptive Stirred, but it wasn't her fault.
she didn't deserve to be fired for how she looked.
that is discrimination.
this is more fun than I thought.
that's great. I take it back.
this was definitely worth the trip.
Mr. Han? - Yes?
Oh. Mr. Han. How do you do? Damien Karp, Infeld/Daniels.
this is Stanton Infeld, the founding partner of the firm.
how do you do?
how many of you are there?
the goat meat is tough again.
can I send it back? - Not now, Tonia.
uh, yes.
you know, it's both unusual and refreshing to see a female butcher.
she's my daughter. - Oh, I gathered.
she rolled her eyes when she went away.
sir, Gene Toy's original attorneys are new to the firm. They're young.
but they still have more than 37 ad leases on bus benches all across the city.
there's no telling what they might put on them.
they could destroy your business.
you come here to blackmail me?
uh, Mr. Han.
you got the meeting, didn't you?
Oh, look. Sheep's brain on sale.
you get to sleep with Zoe Saldana. - I like it.
but your mom has to watch.
um, I'll get it.
how far away is mom?
and is she wearing her glasses?
a foot away. And up-to-date prescription specs.
can it be your mom?
cause I think I could get into that.
welcome back to the island of broken toys.
nice job in court today, Peter.
I helped. - I could, too.
how? - Why?
well, because I'm starting to like your client.
and Karp thinks he's entitled to your office, even though I've been at the firm longer and my billables are higher.
so, what's your strategy?
well, we're going for the hard sell that our client's a babe and hoping that'll force the defense to be mean to a sweet girl.
interesting.
but beauty is about impact.
beauty... is the Helen of Troy...
launching a thousand ships into battle.
beauty... ... is the catalyst for making creatures want to mate.
beauty... can make people do irrational things.
I'm gonna go masturbate.
just to be clear, that was the greatest legal lecture we've ever heard.
but, um Now what?
it's not enough to tell jurors that your client is a babe.
you have to show them that beauty drives people to do irrational things.
show that Jennifer's beauty drove the men at Stirred to act inappropriately.
and convinced Katherine to remove Jennifer from the equation.
love it.
love this.
miss Putnam, these are photographs of female employees who worked with you at Stirred.
do you think these women are attractive?
they put a lot of effort into their appearance, which is admirable.
it is.
do you think you are more beautiful?
Oh, that's not a fair question.
well, under normal circumstances, I'd agree.
but we are here today because you claimed you were dismissed from your job for being too beautiful.
so that would imply that you are more beautiful than these women.
I don't say it to be conceited, but since I'm under oath, yes, I do think I'm more beautiful than them.
but not by much.
thank you, Miss Putnam.
no more questions, your honor.
permission to redirect, your honor. - Really?
the female jurors identify with Jennifer.
they want a shot with guys like you.
they want to be your Helen of Troy.
you want the redirect? - Not really.
why did Infeld hire you?
react to Jennifer's beauty.
Jennifer, we're almost done here.
you know, you have been a great witness.
Oh, you've been a good lawyer, too. - Thank you.
Yes, I- I'm your attorney. So you should be safe.
I can't say the same when you're under cross by Miss Sproik.
she's just doing her job.
Yes, she is -- just like you were just doing yours Stirred, right?
good. Good.
so Jennifer...
can you tell the court how you would answer the phone at Stirred?
uh, what I'd say or how I'd say it? - Either.
both. Here, pretend... this is your phone.
Oh, okay.
Katherine Mack's office. May I help you?
let me just make sure my, uh, phone is turned off.
that'd be embarrassing, huh?
it would. It was off.
but if someone had called, would you have played along?
you take a lot of pride in the party that you planned for the magazine, don't you?
I do. It's a fundraiser downtown.
I got a lunch station where top chefs like Wolfgang Puck make, uh
let me guess. Lunch.
Yes. - Most important meal of the day.
God, I'm... I'm so hungry.
are you hungry?
you have to say "yes" or "no" so the court reporter can get it.
okay.
Yes..."Or "no.
Yes.
Oh! Objection!
counsel is making out with his client on the stand! Your honor!
Mr. Bash, stop kissing your client! Bailiff!
Mr. Bash, I should have you charged with contempt.
it's okay. I don't want to press any charges.
your honor, I'm so sorry.
Mr. Bash was overcome by Miss Putnam's beauty.
it won't happen again.
that was a desperate attempt. - Thanks.
$25, 000 to stop this.
my father's a generous man.
he's also worth over $300 million.
$55, 000, the recommendation letter, and a confidentiality clause with penalty.
fine. - No way.
you know where to contact me.
Yes, I do.
Hey, this is good money.
and we haven't proven anything yet. - Where's Jenn? Have you seen Jenn?
Yeah, she's back at the office. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You okay?
the jury sees Jennifer differently, and so do I.
we're not settling. Gather the troops.
I have a strategy.
stock the courtroom with unattractive women.
it's through there.
give Jennifer a comparative edge.
how can somebody so symmetrical be so annoying at the same time?
I believe they're unrelated.
okay, when it was just us, $55, 000 would have been a gold rush.
okay, why would Katherine offer a recommendation letter and then up the offer to $55, 000?
well, so far, we're stuck at the "she said, they said.
and there are a lot more of them, - and they're coming off a little more -- - Sane?
I've been going over these depo transcripts.
everybody is toeing the company line.
you would, too, if you had Katherine Mack behind you. She's scary.
it's like a culture of secrecy.
you know what? If Jennifer was as bad at her job as they say, why offer a settlement?
remember when we saw Big Mack in the office?
she did everything she could to make sure we had no contact with him.
wait a second. She was hiding Big Mack from you?
Yeah, maybe.
Why? - I don't know.
there is that fundraiser that Jennifer was planning with Katherine.
maybe Big Mack will be there tomorrow.
and so will we.
can you-- can you get down further?
uh, no, uh, I- I can't.
is your forehead touching the floor?
if you can't tell, how will they?
Oh. They know everything.
you have to feel comfortable with the deeply respectful kowtow that the council expects.
Karp, I hope you got that raise.
Oh, I'm-- I'm just fluffing.
you're next.
sir, we need you to sign off on an expense for the Stirred case.
it's for a table at a public fundraiser that Stirred is co-sponsoring.
it's a fantastic cause.
and we want to ask Big Mack some questions before trial.
what is the fantastic cause?
heal... - Uh, save the rain f
... Babies. - Save the rain babies.
Oh, all right. It's a fundraiser. It's tax-deductible.
have a good time.
see, this feels like home.
thank you.
see, I like to think that they're always here, throwing that ball back and forth, back and forth.
where? - Katherine Mack.
Peter, um, I don't want this to be awkward, but you know what happened in court yesterday, that wasn't real.
you'll know when it's real.
Jennifer Putnam is suing us. She can't be here.
well, we wrote a check for $5, 000 for a public fundraiser.
we're not here to cause any trouble.
recycle, reuse... And the other one.
I don't care about you.
it's her I want out.
she helped plan this shindig.
she's not under house arrest.
I don't want security to have to throw her out.
oho! Do.
keep an eye on this group.
Aw, uh, come on!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
you seeing what I'm seeing?
our client in a burkini?
no.
Hey, yeah. Big Mack.
doesn't look too uncomfortable to be around her.
Peter, there's someone I want you to meet.
this is Evan.
he was Big Mack's assistant for two years.
Oh, great.
so, you worked with Jennifer? - I miss her.
she was one of a kind. - Was she good at her job?
I mean, Big Mack wanted to replace me with Jennifer when I left. - Really, now?
wait a minute.
big Mack, I hate to bother you, but I just had to meet the legend.
no, no, no. "Legend" makes me feel old.
Oh, well, I-- you know, I consider myself a self-made man, so what you've got going on here, this is inspiring.
well, life has no dress rehearsal, huh?
copy that.
can I ask you something?
can't promise I'll answer. - Is it true what they say about you?
any woman, anywhere, anytime? - No, no. Not any woman, not anytime.
but most, most of the time.
Oh, my God!
I mean, that is beyond the scope of my imagination.
so-- so, like... Even her?
Yep. 1979.
look at you. - Pretty sure, yeah.
what about Jennifer? - Who's that?
Jennifer. Jennifer Putnam. The girl doing the cannonball.
Oh, oh. You mean peppermint Patty?
Yeah, she had a big bowl of them on her desk.
Oh, was she your assistant? - No, no, no. But I wanted her to be.
what happened? - Oh, uh, I'm a "big picture" guy.
I don't know what the hell happened.
Katherine said that she wasn't good, so...
you ready to defend our title in the 3-legged race?
you got it! Come on. Let's go.
nice meeting you. - You too.
y-you just talked to Big Mack.
you will, too. We're gonna put him on the stand.
and Big Mack doesn't know as much about women as he thinks.
I don't know anything about women.
that is true.
Ah, Mr. Toy.
I do apologize. I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
Oh, no problem. - Ah, please sit down.
good. Now, Mr. Toy, look.
I intend to clear my firm's name.
and to tell you the truth, I'm fascinated by the council.
and-- and, obviously, I'm concerned for you.
obviously.
uh, so, what did you want to talk about?
the frozen rabbit in your pants.
it wasn't in my pants.
it was in my waistband. I-I've got a python.
Ohh! Impressive! Congratulations.
uh, no, I-- it's a pet.
it's a snake.
you know, we have more in common than you may think.
I had one named Suzy.
Oh, she was aloof, but I adored her... Until she escaped.
uh, but anyway, that's another story, huh?
uh, well, I-I feed my python one thawed rabbit a week.
right? And I was a day late.
Oh, and I know firsthand, you can't defrost those cottontails in the microwave without the meat getting stringy!
exactly. - Right?
right, so I was just jump-starting the thawing process while I shopped.
I was gonna pay for it, I swear.
and the pet store across the street, you know, they're selling frozen rabbit at half the price.
and we know, don't we, that pythons will eat anything, Gene.
so I suspect there was another draw to Han's market that you're not telling me about.
okay.
Mr. Mack -- - You kissed your client on the stand.
sit down, Mr. Bash.
your honor, I think there's only a slight chance of him kissing Mr. Mack.
I'll do it.
Mr. Mack...
is it true you wanted Jennifer to be your assistant after Evan resigned?
I made an offhand remark about it.
what happened?
ultimately, I decided against it.
Why?
because my daughter, Katherine, said Jennifer wasn't competent.
how would you describe your relationship with Jennifer?
were you close? - Not really, but, uh
but you got along well. - Sure, yeah. She's a good kid.
she's a 27-year-old woman.
did I say something wrong?
I mean, I didn't call her "girl" or-- or-- or "honey.
I said,"kid," like I call my daughter.
so she's like a daughter to you?
those are your words.
actually, they're yours.
you compared her to your daughter.
if you'd like, I can have the court reporter read back.
no, no. It's fine.
so, by my account, the only two women at Stirred who you haven't had sexual relations with are Katherine Mack, your daughter, and Jennifer Putnam. Is that true?
objection.
relevance, your honor. -Some leeway.
overruled. You may continue.
not the only ones.
there are a handful in payroll.
of course there are.
no further questions.
party planning is a lot of pressure. Am I right?
I suppose.
take your dad, for example.
could you tell the court some of his requirements at Stirred events?
I don't know.
grass-fed Argentine beef and sustainable caviar?
and the vaporizers. What kind?
Musk-scented misters. - Right, right, and he also likes trampolines and 3-legged races?
yes and yes.
at Saturday's fundraiser, did your father ask you to run the 3-legged race with him?
I was in heels. I couldn't.
over 35 years, how many outdoor functions would you say you've attended with your father?
I don't know. - Ballpark?
uh, we have 2 or 3 a year, so 75?
75?
and has he ever asked you to run the 3-legged race, even when you weren't in heels?
I always wear heels.
who did he ask to run the race with him on Saturday?
her.
you mean the plaintiff, Jennifer Putnam?
Yes.
no more questions, your honor.
Oh, uh, s-sorry.
I-I think I have the wrong room.
Oh, Gene.
uh... Uh, this isn't a Jackie Chan movie.
uh, gentlemen, I'm humbled and grateful for this audience in front of the council of elders on behalf of my good friend, Gene Toy.
council of elders?
we're a merchants' association.
Yes, quite.
I'd like to call a witness.
witness?
no. Mr. Infeld, council, please. - Tonia?
I'll just take my punishment and leave.
I believe Tonia has something to say.
now, let her speak.
are you sure?
dad. Gene may not be a doctor.
he may not speak perfect Mandarin.
he might not have a deep voice or a strong handshake.
he certainly might not set the world on fire, but, dad, he sets world on fire.
and... ...I love him.
see, a left-handed compliment from the woman of your dreams is like a shiv between the third and fourth rib that just misses your heart.
tonia, we'll talk about this at home.
you can't tell me who to date or who to marry, dad.
marry?
I don't want you thinking about marriage until after you graduate college.
I have ambitions for you.
and I know that, dad.
just because I love Gene doesn't mean I'm gonna forget all that.
if I may.
uh, Mr. Han, it seems that we've locked horns over a youthful fling.
gene Toy came to your market, even though your frozen rabbit is, by the way, not competitively priced.
he respected your edict not to date Tonia.
he just wanted the opportunity to see her, to watch her skin a goat or to hear her laugh.
gentlemen, please allow Gene Toy to continue to live his dream here in Chinatown.
not only did Big Mack ignore his biological daughter, Katherine, but almost as hurtful, he took a shine to Jennifer.
as we've proven, our client's beauty was a liability.
she stole the spotlight from Katherine, and she became like another daughter to Big Mack.
in the end, ladies and gentlemen, our client was, indeed, fired for being too beautiful.
you can take shots at me all you want, but when you start attacking my daughter, I have to intervene.
I raised her.
sort of.
this is my fault. I want it settled now.
well, see, our client doesn't want a settlement.
she wants a jury verdict. - I don't.
Jennifer, what do you want?
I want my job back. - You got it.
you'll be my assistant. How about that?
and one more thing.
yes?
I want the company's plastic-surgery fund to be sent to Operation Smile.
that way, children with cleft palates can find success and acceptance, just like Joaquin Phoenix.
done.
Hey, I'm a big fa
What'd I tell you? -I know.
okay. -End zone.
all right, you're all set. You're online.
Gene! Thank you.
thank you, huh?
if you guys hadn't screwed everything up,
I would've given up and lost Tonia.
Ah, you're welcome.
Oh, and your boss should really start his own religion.
he amazing.
you know, I'm just glad you've been returned to full Chinatown status.
need a refill?
Yes. Yeah. - Fill her up?
are you guys squatters, or do you actually live here?
Wow! Look who it is.
Wow. - Now only do we live here, we thrive here, brother.
what you got there?
I'm sorry you have to give it up.
well, it's not the guitar, it's the guitarist.
and that guitar is for that guitarist.
double or nothing?
you're hysterical. That's adorable.
you look like a man who could use a beverage.
ever heard of beer Jenga? - Is it an import?
Oh, God.
kiss it. - Just kiss it.
you're a naughty little minx, aren't you? - Cannonball! Whoo!
she knows that's a hot tub, right?
come on, guys, lets go! Let's do this. Let's go. Let's go.
all right, am I gonna have to carry you punks again?
are you ready? - I get the sniper rifle.
Where's my grenade launcher? - Whoa!
eyes above the waist. Come on, now.
we are intelligent human beings.
where you goin', gorgeous?
amber North, simone winters - Erotic aerobic instructors.
Oh, hello.
owners of rock & pole. That's catchy.
we didn't rob those brentwood bitches.
l. a.p. d. Said they found a $50, 000 ring in your workout bag after you taught an in-home pole-dancing class, uh... Amber?
I'm Amber. She's Simone.
I don't know how that stupid ring got in our bag.
and we didn't take that lady's necklace.
someone's messing with us.
we're here to get you off.
that lynx tracked my scent across the entire north ridge of the peters glacier.
now, luckily, she only got a piece of my flesh and not my determination to summit denali.
it's amazing, Mr. Infeld.
Hey, you know, I should climb denali next.
that's a good - Oh, Hanna, uh, Damien!
I'd like you to meet our new client. This is alex carlisle.
Alex rode his bicycle all the way up here from orange county.
last time I checked, stanton, we don't do curfew violations.
actually, I want to to solo the amazon.
aker but my dad won't let me.
he's being sponsored by the founder of outdoor apparel, but his father has placed a preliminary injunction to stop him from going.
how old are you, alex? - I'm 13.
Oh, this is not your ordinary teenager, hanna, no.
I. q. 173. Master falcon scout at 9.
and there isn't a river I can't kayak blindfolded.
cool. Um, it's a suicide mission.
we might as well ask the judge's permission to let him jump his schwinn across the grand canyon.
what if somebody told alexander the great that he was too young to rule a kingdom, or a young kobayashi that he couldn't eat 60 hot dogs?
No! Great achievements involve great risk.
well, we... Welcome the challenge.
Alex is very inspiring.
thanks for your support.
it's an honor to meet a boy as brave as you.
you're very kind, but it's been a while since I was a boy.
ladies. - hello.
made it to the high-rise but still working out of the basement.
all right, let's blast the roof off this joint.
Eddie and Hagar?
hagar sells tequila now.
noted. Retro roth?
judge douglas, the d. a. Would have you believe that our clients are merely two women with drop-dead legs who dance the night away for a living.
these beautiful girls are successful entrepreneurs who built their rock & pole business from the ground up.
your honor, they're using van halen song titles as a defense.
you really got me.
don't push your luck, gentlemen.
your honor, we'd like to enter a plea of "not guilty.
and respectfully request our clients' release on their own recognizance, pending trial.
your honor, ms. North and ms. Winters stand accused of stealing $350, 000 worth of jewelry after drugging their victims during a glorified sex show.
drugging those housewives?
we would never do that.
the state requests bail be set at $100, 000.
that's ridiculous, your honor.
they have no prior records.
and their 6-inch stilettos the defendants are hereby released on their own recognizance.
Yes. - there you go.
next case, Miss Ross.
what is this dealing with? - I don't know.
dirty twirlers has been on our vision board since law school!
you know, Amber is a former clippers cheerleader.
I recognize those moves.
Oh, man! It's like catching a mermaid in the same net!
so, about an hour after this footage was shot, the guests passed out from laced margaritas, woke up cleaned out.
what does the toxicology report say about the drugs?
uh, hycobine.
french vicodin. Very rare.
sounds naughtier than regular vicodin.
amber and simone never even heard of it.
they said they taught the class, things got crazy, so they bolted.
how'd the cops find the engagement ring in their bag?
the police searched their apartment the next morning when amber wasn't there.
Simone claims that they shared the bag.
amber wasn't there, but it's her apartment.
Simone didn't have the authority to let the police in.
illegal search & seizure.
get that ring tossed out, and janie's case falls apart.
boom.
come in!
Where's pindar?
Hey! Our favorite defendants.
what is with the sad faces?
tell them what you told me this afternoon in the steam room.
three years ago, I worked for a club in arizona.
you know, the other kind of dancing.
there's no shame in being versatile.
she robbed the club's safe, spent 30 days in jail.
the manager screwed me out of my tips.
I only took what was owed me.
this totally sucks.
Yeah, coming from money doesn't make you an angel.
we work the same pole.
my douchebag lawyer sold me out in court.
it happened so fast, they, uh- They booked me under my stage name "sherry pie." Nobody ever knew.
well, one thing's for sure -If janie had this info, - she would've rubbed it in our faces by now. - yeah.
we worked so hard to finally go legit.
now we're right back where everyone expects us to be.
Hey, listen, it's gonna be fine.
okay, by the time we're done, every milfy housewife and cougar's gonna be ling up around the block to take lessons from you again, okay?
single for a smile?
I've read your motion to have the ring deemed inadmissible.
I've decided to deny it.
approach, your honor?
your honor, this is a textbook 4th-amendment violation.
as you two should know, the defendants cohabited at the time of the arrest, implying a commonality of privileges.
so, denied.
can you at least nod like we're saying something smart?
go away.
your honor, some new evidence came in to our office this morning- Fingerprints on an upstairs bedroom door matching simone winters, the same bedroom door containing the stolen necklace.
you bitch!
that's what you were doing upstairs?
I went upstairs to look for the bathroom.
okay. Whoa, whoa Defrost like when I caught you in my louboutins?
ladies, this is not the place. - Deep breaths.
happy thoughts. - I borrowed those.
okay, quiet contest, starting now! - I am not going to prison for her.
you are making this way too easy.
squabbling clients.
you know, you try to rescue two drowning swimmers at once, you go down with them.
you have to let one go.
but what if they're both innocent?
see, there is another way.
we could put up a chinese wall.
ahh, yes, the great wall of china itself
choose a side and stick to it.
we split up the women between us. - and the firm keeps the case.
don't be fooled, boys.
I've seen many partnerships destroyed by the divisive nature of the wall.
our friendship's survived a lot worse than not working together.
Yeah, we didn't talk the entire summer peter was at jazz camp.
rock camp. - With clarinets.
your responsibility will be to your clients, not each other.
Yeah. - Yeah.
trying the same case alone.
you could be disbarred.
our lips are sealed.
all right.
you have my blessing.
Franklin versus bash it is.
the jury would look unfavorably on new counsel.
so, to keep everyone happy, jared and I have decided to represent each of you individually.
separate lawyers, same courtroom.
everything's like it was, except you can't discuss the details of the case with each other.
by the way, you're doing a terrific job so far.
how are we supposed to pick between you guys?
well, to avoid the awkwardness of upsetting jared, we've chosen for you.
amber, you're with me. Simone, dibs on Jared.
so not cool if amber gets the better lawyer.
which one of you is smarter?
we're both equally-- I am.
ask peter who got 179 on his lsat.
same guy who cried when he lost his last trial.
ask jared who won the appeal for him.
pindar's agrees with me. Pindar!
no, pindar's with me, homey.
karaoke brothers for life.
I'm sorry. I'm working on karp's amazon river case.
did you know the candiru fish can swim up your urethra and live in your penis for weeks?
Oh, uh, infeld's got me trailing a jamaican guy who stole his identity, so you guys are on your own.
our goal is to show the judge that, despite your age, you're competent enough to paddle down the amazon.
which means we may have to put you on the stand.
I have to warn you, some of opposing counsel's questions won't be very friendly.
Mr. Karp, I'll be paddling down 2, 000 miles of class-five rapids in a kayak.
and crawling on the shore can kill me in a matter of seconds.
I'll be fine.
all right, then. Good to hear.
can I ask you two a question?
sure.
do either of you have kids?
no.
do you want them?
maybe. - sure.
Alex, I'll be in the car.
okay, dad. I'll be a minute.
don't forget to validate.
right.
you and your father seem to be on good terms, despite him trying to stop you.
he's a good guy. He... Just worries.
ladies, thanks for coming to infeld/daniels.
no problem.
they shot a deodorant commercial at my house last week.
it's being repainted.
this is almost preferable to the paint fumes.
well, I'm flattered.
so, just to clarify, ms. Mcdowell, your house is where the robbery took place?
is that accurate? - That's right.
Simone and amber performed their routine there for the pole-dancing class, and we each took turns trying out the moves they taught us.
Really? What- What kind of moves for the -?
the anaconda, the jackhammer.
they had us spread our legs, grind against the pole.
spinning, thrusting.
the jackhammer.
I see.
you stated to the police that my client, amber north, never left the pole.
well, I don't remember.
I was drugged.
they had to have been upstairs.
but a lot went on that night, ms. Elliott.
I mean, your first girl-on-girl kiss can be confusing.
you know, lots of fuzzy feelings- nothing's fuzzy.
amber and simone seduced us, then stole our stuff.
so... Nothing is fuzzy.
how was it really any different than any other book-club meeting?
we don't usually get naked and do tequila shots off each other's breasts.
Oh, okay, so your bra fell off, your panties fell off.
not impossible your engagement ring...
slipped off with everything else and somehow ended up in the girls' workout bag?
they were casing the place from the moment they got there.
Amber's fingerprints weren't anywhere upstairs near the purses and jewelry, so isn't it possible my client never made it up there?
are you hitting on me?
I don't know. Am i?
Mr. Bash, your client took an excellent business opportunity and threw it away.
we should throw our own pole-dancing party for brentwood housewives.
can't talk about it.
I'm not discussing the case.
can't talk about it.
come on. Look at you, all by-the-book.
has that ever worked for you?
you mean, worked forus? - Yeah.
you, me- family. What you got?
dude, come on. - Dude, come on.
dude. - dude.
come on.
no phantom smells.
you're both wearing shirts.
we also have a strict pop-by policy.
what's the password?
Cnese wall. - That's two words.
as much as I'd love to see you go at it like gladiators, I brought a gift.
I get one?
whoever comes to me first gets to walk.
second place, gets 10 years.
she's just trying to divide and conquer.
Yeah, get inside our heads.
Yeah. - It's not gonna work.
no. - Seriously?
it's for you. It's your mother.
come to order.
defense calls mike bennett.
Mr. Bennett, can you tell us your role at scott avenue productions?
Yeah, I'm a painter.
when we go on location, I paint the rental homes to accommodate our sets.
after the robbery, you did work at ms. Mcdowell's house for a deodorant commercial?
Yeah, I painted everything sierra tan - cabinets, doors, molding.
and then what? You repaint everything back to its original color?
spanish sand.
and during deposition, you stated that painting all those doors was a "pain in the ass
'cause you had to take all the doors off their hinges.
Yeah, we had to line them all up, and then we hit 'em with the spray gun.
right.
ever seen the movie "the fugitive"?
Yeah, like a hundred times.
Harrison ford in his prime. - absolutely.
lost my "sexiest man alive" crown to him more than once.
objection.
I'm sorry. Is Mr. Bash implying that he's the only one allowed to be cute?
the most frustrating part of that movie is the jury convicts Dr. Kimble only because they couldn't find that freaky one-armed killer's fingerprints.
Objection! - On what grounds?
the movie reference.
you know, the self-deprecating joke. The buttoning the jacket!
those are my moves. He's stealing them.
overruled.
now, Mr. Bennett, is it possible the reason my client's fingerprints were on the bedroom doorknob was because that door was actually the bathroom door?
Yeah, it's possible, I guess.
they're supposed to be identical, but I rearranged them a few times, yeah.
so my client's fingerprints might have actually been on the bathroom door, as she claimed.
thank you, Mr. Bennett.
it's all yours, pal.
nice to see you.
hello.
how are you?
Hey.
Hi.
Oh, come on - Objection!
he's hitting on the entire jury box, your honor!
thank you.
my uniform is totally lame. I look like a tool in front of hanna.
Oh, your accomplishments will impress the judge.
do I have to wear the nut-hugger shorts?
I didn't design the uniform.
you're not making 13 any easier on him.
tell us how you earned your plant-science badge.
I can identify over 5, 000 edible, medicinal, and poisonous plants.
relevance, your honor.
a practical understanding of survival doesn't guarantee that alex can adapt his knowledge under duress.
sustained.
ms. Linden?
I have an affidavit from Dr. Harold cohen, an entomologist on staff at UCLA.
he certified that the contents of this box include four harmless insects and one poisonous one, all of which alex could encounter on his trip down the amazon.
camel cricket.
madagascar hissing cockroach.
bamboo worm.
you missed one.
wouldn't do that, your honor.
Lonomia caterpillars cause foaming of the mouth and kidney failure.
your witness.
Hey.
can I talk to you for a minute, off the record?
uh- oh. I know that face.
guy troubles. What'd he do?
took a case he'll lose because his best friend's kicking his ass.
here we go.
I'm just calling it like I see it.
or I've underestimated jared's ability.
Yeah, see, I know what you're doing, and you're not gonna get in my head.
do what's best for your client.
reconsider the deal.
Oh, look at that. Jared just texted.
wonder what he wants.
being a falcon scout should set you apart from other boys in the woods, wouldn't you say?
it's the highest rank attainable in the trail scouts of america.
but the only time you spent in the wild was last year with outward bound, - where they called you "wuss." - objection.
Argumentative. - Mr. Lavetta.
isn't that what they called you, Alex?
Yes.
and didn't they call you "wuss
because you left three days into your two-week hike?
look, they were immature.
why did you leave early?
please answer the question, Alex.
I was worried about my father.
enlighten us. How were you able to interpret his feelings, alone, in the middle of the rocky mountains?
smoke signals? Skywriting?
I just knew, okay?
sounds like an excuse! - Leave me alone!
Objection! Please instruct counsel to stop badgering the witness.
you were homesick, weren't you?
weren't you?!
ease up, don!
your honor, we request a recess.
give me a break, Mr. Lavetta.
look, I'll be wrestling crocodiles.
takes a little more than that to make me cry.
request for recess withdrawn, your honor.
awesome.
Oh, you're so sweet. Thank you.
but, honestly, it's genetics,'cause I haven't touched a weight in like 30 years.
it's crazy. - You never lift weights?
never, no. And I can eat anything I want.
Carmen, would you remind Mr. Bash that I've reserved the hot tub from 10: 00 to 10: 30?
Jared, he can hear you.
Pindar, can you tell Mr. Franklin that I'm using this time as restitution for using my moves in court?
Mr. Franklin, Mr. Bash would like you to know- used your moves?
I loaned you my persona.
we made you the charming one for marketing purposes.
you know what? Keep my moves as a gift.
but you're not stealing anything else.
really. - Yeah.
universal remote. It's mine.
na gave it to me for my birthday.
no, no, universal remote is mine.
super bowl winnings, my friends.
somebody please make this stop.
good luck doing franklin & bash without the bash.
I'm sorry, you're billing yourself as "the bash" now?
aren't you guys, like, both supposed to be on our side?
you know what? Keep it.
I don't want it. - I don't want it.
if it wasn't for the bash, you'd still be waxing your daddy's jag for allowance.
well, if the moves I stole were so fantastic, how come janie dumped the bash?
mine's much bigger.
I've never been concerned about size, peter.
we went over that when we dated.
look, i'm not here to flirt.
you need shelter from a tumbling wall that's about to crush you.
all right, not saying that I want your deal, but my client is curious.
would she have to give factual basis acknowledging her guilt?
you help me take down simone, and Amber can plead petty theft as a misdemeanor.
that's three years probation.
we could back the truck up with incriminating testimony.
what was that about incriminating testimony... Partner?
you gave him the deal? His client's the guilty one.
Simone targeted Amber.
bad influence corrupts catholic schoolgirl? Classic porno story line.
exactly why Amber put it on simone.
catholic schoolgirls are the wildest.
janie, where do I sign? - no. Deal's off.
watching you two sell each other out seems I can definitely get convictions onbothdefendants.
Oh, it's on.
like donkey kong.
Simone, as an entrepreneur, it is in your interest to keep a clean record, correct?
I could lose my business license.
because rock & pole's categorized as "sexually-oriented,
I have to pass routine background checks.
your honor, I'm submitting a copy of ms. Winters' business license to show it's currently up-to-date.
one moment, your honor.
the business license is under your name.
why not amber's?
amber failed the background check.
she never paid her credit cards, and some company reported her for fraud.
objection, your honor.
prejudicial impact outweighs any probative value.
overruled.
fraud, financial problems.
no more questions.
ms. Winters, could you tell us all the aliases you've danced under?
I've used a lot of names- Uh, Serenity, Jade, Diamond.
have you ever been "sherry pie"?
I, uh... I used that name at a topless bar in arizona.
Oh, the same bar whose safe you were convicted of robbing three years ago.
Objection!
betrayal?
withdrawn. I think the jury knows exactly what's going on here.
this is supposed to be a business meeting.
I'm tired of talking about me.
let's talk about you.
uh, alex, you're 13.
age is arbitrary.
sorry I'm late. Stanton had to dry-run his bohemian grove speech.
I wasn't expecting company.
everything okay? - perfect timing.
I was just about to ask Alex why he left outward bound.
my dad's divorce hit him hard.
and his anniversary happened during my trip.
once I made it to the mountains, I felt bad, so I came home.
that's a beautiful story.
but how do we persuade the judge that you won't feel the same way in south america?
Mr. Karp, could you excuse us?
I made go-karting reservations for hanna and myself.
uh, Alex, I'm gonna be in court all afternoon.
that's okay.
I'm free all week.
that was very smooth.
I've always found that the quickest way to a woman's heart is through go-karting.
I'm about to break a world record.
what have you ever done that a girl would care about?
well, the clippers dropped me from my contract after I tore my a. c.l.
terminated contract.
surgery on the knee. Credit cards piled up.
I have a supportive family.
my father helped me pay them off, but the damage was already done.
your honor, ms. North's credit card and bank statements are marked and entered.
this will show she had no outstanding debts and maintained positive cash flow prior to the robbery.
your witness.
bailiff, can we get a chair for Mr. Bash?
ms. North, you had any recent medical procedures, other than your a. c.l. Surgery?
uh, yes, but I, um...
that information is extremely personal.
well, Ms. North, I'm sure your secret is safe here.
please.
I had my... Deviated septum repaired to stop snoring.
and what pain medication were you prescribed during recovery?
I don't recall the name of it.
page 6, would you read aloud the prescription you had refilled two months ago?
hycobine.
Hycobine- The same french drug used to knock out the housewives.
I didn't have it on me that night.
well, then this must be the most convenient excuse in the history of convenient excuses.
one degree of bowie" mix I promised to make you for your birthday...
two years ago.
dolls, Iggy, P-Diddy...
you know, we broke our pact to never let a case come between us.
actually, our pact was to never work mondays or fridays.
seems like last week we were sitting right here, waiting for rollerbladers to crash into unlicensed street vendors.
Where'd it all go?
that was last week.
remember simmons versus hot diggity dosa?
for indecent exposure?
we argued it wasn't public because he got naked in his alley where he lived.
what are we gonna do?
we already won this case for janie.
not if we get the band back together.
forget everything we said.
our defense is strongest when we're a team.
we need to destroy our wall and become the new, new berlin.
I'd rather keep the wall.
I don't want to help simone.
okay, if you keep the wall, you both go away for five years.
Jared and I have learned a valuable lesson through this ordeal.
the greatest success stories come from duos.
Simon & Garfunkel, Richards and Jagger, r2 and 3po, Tom and Jerry!
ice dancing sensations Torvill and Dean.
no.
I can't go back to jail.
I don't ever want to go.
there we go.
see? This feels right.
I hiked runyon this morning.
a hard trail.
might tackle the super sprint triathlon in san diego.
he's gotten to you, hasn't he?
who? No!
come on. I'm not threatened by a 13-year-old.
see, that's the problem with our case.
when a kid succeeds at something adults fear, grown-ups lose their power.
you don't think we should've put him on the stand?
- No,dad,look,don't get hysterical.
it's just a flat tire.
no, I already called the road club.
dad, just stay on the phone with me until they get there, okay?
all right, half an hour. I'll take the...
I think we put the wrong kid on the stand.
okay, Pindar, you're starting to scare me.
will you stop watching that?
I can't look away. It's just so beautiful.
how did kelly mcdowell find you guys?
we're friends with kesha's choreographers They referred us.
Yeah, ms. Mcdowell bailed on them at the last minute.
it was too expensive.
too expensive for brentwood?
how much do poles cost?
those girls are the best. They charge 5 g's.
wait. That's what the housewives said they paid you.
I wish. We only got 2 grand.
who got the rest?
Dr. Etienne gave me my high beams!
Pindar, you're killin' me, okay?
I can't access both parts of my brain at once.
Dr. Etienne?
he's the plastic surgeon who did my nose job.
french doctor.
same french doctor could mean same french drug.
why would Ms. Mcdowell rob herself and her friends?
it's pretty thin. - We've had thinner.
this one's gonna need a feeding tube.
okay, so, she wasn't home, but I did find something you'll recognize from the old days.
Ah, foreclosure notices. - Hey.
I looked into Scott avenue productions.
they started working with Ms. Mcdowell six months ago.
she calls twice a week and begs them to book her home.
so she's house rich and cash poor.
what about the jewelry?
well, my pawnshop boys haven't heard anything that matches our property.
Yeah, try to sell a $300, 000 necklace and she'd trigger homeland security.
she also went to the bank the day after the robbery.
didn't make any deposits or withdraw any money.
if she didn't make any deposits, what was Ms. Mcdowell doing there?
maybe she wasn't depositing money.
what about a safe-deposit box?
Dr. Carlisle, could you describe the circumstances under which your marriage ended?
Alex's mother left us six years ago, to paint watercolor landscapes in albuquerque with her instructor...
Alphonso.
transition must've been difficult, being a single parent?
Alex and I do just fine.
how often do you do the laundry?
a couple of times a week, I assume.
Alex does the laundry.
who manages your bills? - Alex.
so, on top of training for kayaking competions, earning badges, and being a genius, he does your bookkeeping?
it's not unusual for a boy to have some after-school chores.
grocery shopping- Who does that?
my son also goes to the supermarket.
I'm sorry.
but, Dr. Carlisle, what exactly are your chores?
seems like alex supervises every aspect of your life.
we take care of each other, Mr. Karp.
that's what families do.
and who's gonna take care of you when Alex is on that river?
no one.
I mean, me. I'll- I'll take care of myself.
you're not worried about Alex being alone in the jungle... Are you?
you're worried about him leaving you.
don't listen to him, dad.
it's okay, Alex.
I'm fine.
and I'll be fine... While you're on your trip.
what is it that couldn't wait?
we have evidentiary support that implicates Ms. Mcdowell in the robbery, your honor.
she had access to the same drugs as our clients.
I don't want to know how you obtained this, Mr. Franklin.
95% of what I did, your honor, is 100% legal.
you'll see in our motion.
you want me to accept this into evidence?
we'd also like to subpoena her safe-deposit box.
we believe she's concealing the stolen jewelry.
your honor, we're in the middle of trial.
we can't accept new evidence at this late juncture.
we're asking a bit of leeway, your honor, not that we deserve it.
it is not my problem that opposing counsel wasted their resources trying to decapitate each other.
I've watched you boys tear each other apart turned my courtroom into a dinner theater.
and now you expect me to introduce your encore?
ms. Mcdowell framed our clients.
ms. Mcdowell is not on trial, Mr. Franklin.
your honor - - denied.
ms. Mcdowell, can you explain why you had your diamond necklace appraised six months ago?
insurance won't issue a policy without a certified appraisal.
$300, 000 necklace, and you never had it insured?
my timing was fortunate.
miraculous, considering you need $300, 000 to save your house from foreclosure.
Objection!
Mr. Franklin, you've been warned.
your honor, if ms. Mcdowell does not have the diamond necklace, then she'll be okay with me opening her safe-deposit box.
with your permission, Ms. Mcdowell.
hold it. I've seen this bluff before.
that box doesn't belong to her, does it?
it's mine, your honor.
I should hold you in contempt.
instead, I'll admit your box.
go on. Amuse us with your precious valuables.
I- I'll- I'll take- I'll take contempt, your honor. That's fair.
you need a dose of your own medicine, Mr. Franklin.
open the box.
okay.
uh, it's a vhs of wrestlemania viii - Ric flair versus macho man.

my wife and I caught that twice on broadway.
this is my high-school production.
I was the butler.
everything in that box is evidence in this court.
your honor, um... This is just a prescription for hycobine that ms. Mcdowell refilled two days prior to the robbery.
That's-that's-that's not mine.
Mr. Franklin, I ruled that evidence inadmissible.
but, your honor, you ordered me to admit it, against my wishes.
objection, your honor!
overruled.
bring it home, pal.
ms. Mcdowell... Let's talk about one of my favorite topics - breasts.
excuse me? - I'm sorry. I forgot.
you like to call them your high beams.
Objection! Relevance.
your honor, those breasts were her partner in crime.
why not? I've already given you enough rope to hang yourself.
you had hycobine in your system because Dr. Etienne prescribed it to you after your breast-enlargement surgery.
and pinning the crime on amber and simone would distract the insurance company from investigating the loss of your diamond necklace, wouldn't it?
you laced those drinks and stole your own jewelry, didn't you?
thanks for playing, red. Good game.
good. No hard feelings.
regrettably, I'm unable to attend your engagement soiree next weekend.
I have my annual check-up with my mats? s Shaman.
engagement party. - Didn't invite me.
thank you, stanton. - I have one just like it. Please.

Nathan will love it. Thank you.
uh, who's nathan?
well, chalk up another victory for team Franklin and Bash.
you knew exactly what you were doing when you allowed the chinese wall.
I know this much, Mr. Bash.
you never value what you have until it's gone.
thanks for dropping the case.
I trusted you to make decisions for me all these years.
maybe it's time you do that for yourself.
come here.
you were good with Alex.
I'm good with anyone who flatters me.
I think it's a little more than that.
you know having a kid could never make you ordinary.
congratulations, team.
I commend your instinct about putting my dad on the stand.
well, that's very high praise.
the Amazon does not stand a chance against you.
I'm going.
look, Hanna, we both know the stress long distance can put on a relationship.
I can't ask you to put your life on hold for me.
Alex - - just kidding.
look, you're supersonic hot.
can I call you in 15 years?
10.0
Oh, look at this.
Ohh. See?
Yes, yes.
Yeah. - Just feels like yes.
you know they're not clients, so it's fair game.
nearly broke us up. They could be cursed.
but it's your call.
eh, what are my odds at getting another shot at a former clippers cheerleader?
wait, wait. Why do you get Amber?
you wanted to send her to jail. - That was business.
well, I'm fine with either.
Yeah, they will be, too.
we're win-win. - You know it.
all right, you get one shot with the hottest twins on the planet.
can they be conjoined?
no, that's one person. Twintwins.
my father worked for 25 years spilling sweat and blood.
without him, they'd be nowhere.
and now new owners come in, and they want to put him down like an old horse.
as God is my witness, I won't let them get away with it.
little over the top.
sit down, Amelia. You're making me nervous.
she's making you nervous?
Hey, how did we spend $200 on handkerchiefs?
I'm studying magic.
Lucha Libre has been in our family for generations.
they want me to retire based on my age.
they want me to lose a fight, have my mask taken off in the ring.
I think I deserve a fair shot.
and why you keep looking at my daughter?!
uh, I- I wasn't. I, um
I- I thought I saw something behind your daughter. - Daddy, stop.
I agree with you, ultimo. He was talking to you. But he was looking at your daughter.
no, I- I wasn't. - He kind of was.
no, I was looking to see if there was- You were looking at my daughter!
eh, just joking.
I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.
it's a simple arraignment.
I thought budget cuts did away with night court.
no, I asked for it. To throw off the media jackals.
if we enter a plea now, they miss a news cycle.
Oh, perhaps another athlete will text photos of his genitals
wipe this mess off the front page.
good evening, Your Honor.
due to the seriousness of this case
actually, why don't you let her do the talking?
sorry, Your Honor.
force of habit.
Brett caiman, Your Honor.
your reputation precedes you.
thank you.
to the charge of murder in the first degree, on behalf of my client, Stanton Infeld, we enter a plea of "Not guilty.
Mr. Infeld is prepared to surrender to custody.
the defendant is remanded. No bail.
bailiff, take him into custody.
Ow! No!
I haven't done anything yet!
man, he is hopeless. Ultimo, show me.
you've never been to the Santa Monica Pier?
it's the eighth-highest Ferris Wheel in America.
did you just make that up?
Yes. I did. Just now.
isn't there something about lawyers and their clients...?
which is why I'm not asking out your father.
otherwise, I would,'cause he's right in my wheelhouse, but... Uh, I got to take this.
Hey, guys, did you see this?
Peter and Jared, in the office.
urgent. - Yeah.
okay, okay. U-u-ultimo, I have to go.
Hey.
does anyone know what's going on?
I have an idea.
if this is one of Infeld's trust-building exercises
it's not.
I'm Brett Caiman. I'm with the -- - New York office.
what's going on?
Stanton is in lockup. He's being held without bail.
for what? - Murder.
I get it. - Yeah.
this is one of those murder-mansion mystery things.
Oh, I love those! Love these things. - Vintage Infeld.
all right, who's the victim?
Gibson Hawke. - That's a cool name!
he was one of my Uncle's best friends.
disappeared 15 years ago. They were climbing Mount McKinley together.
which is where his body was found five days ago.
I don't have much more information yet.
I'm starting to think- This is real?
Yeah, we should stop talking now.
but why are we hearing this from you?
new York wanted someone sent out to oversee things until the situation plays itself out.
well, enjoy your stay,'cause I don't work for you.
actually, you do.
Karp, Franklin, and Bash, you're trial team-- Stanton's call.
there's a surprise.
everything case-related goes through me.
that's it for now.
I'll be handling discovery.
I'll need two of you overseeing...
is Stanton okay? - What's with her?
she's been a trial assassin.
now she works the cases from behind the scenes, you know, manipulates the media.
Why? We got this.
Yeah. For once, you and I agree.
I'm gonna go see Stanton. - Let's go.
you two busy? I've got something to show you.
actually, we're gonna go see Infeld right now.
Yeah, it's not a request.
meet you outside in five minutes. I'll drive.
when I started out at the D. A.'s office, they taught me it was critical to see the most important witness, the one the jury never gets to hear from-- the victim.
why are his eyes open?
uh, let me guess -- uh, your first corpse?
not mine. Premed.
one medical man to another, I noticed the decedent is still clothed.
Yes, well, due to the condition we found the body in, we were only able to conduct a partial autopsy.
fantastic, can we just concentrate on the second-most important person on the case?
there's no way Stanton's guilty.
he told authorities 15 years ago that, when the blizzard hit,
Hawke insisted on heading out for help, and they never saw him again.
he was 20, 000 feet up in a blizzard!
Yeah. There's all kinds of ways to die up there, right?
Yes, but Mr. Hawke died from a 6-inch stab wound to his abdomen.
what?
he was, uh, stabbed to death. And unless he was mugged by a Yeti, I'd say
Aah! - Ohh.
he moved! He moved.
he didn't move! - Interesting.
uh, it could be contractions as the ice molecules dissipate, but he's not, uh...
he's thawing out?
okay. Excuse me for a second.
Hey, hey, hey, look. Hey, okay, okay.
you're thinking "Encino man"?
can't happen. Okay?
you're in a safe place. Okay?
sorry.
here's the murder weapon-- a climbing knife, scrimshaw handle.
okay, there's got to be hundreds of knives like this.
with the name "Stanton Infeld" inscribed in the handle?
we need to see our client.
so, Stanton, we got to ask.
what? If I'm guilty?
a good lawyer never asks his client whether he's guilty or not.
come on, Stanton. You're not a client. You're family.
listen. There is a good reason why the story I told 15 years ago is inconsistent with the way that Gibson's body was found.
see? I told you so.
I lied to the police.
that's not a good reason at all.
look, Hawke and I were great friends.
I mean, we were golf and tennis partners. We even pursued the same women.
and let's just say that... More than a few wagers were made over the years, but...
that night... He was different.
he was... angry, irrational.
our guide ordered us down when we were only 200 feet from the summit.
well, Gibson refused. He said he was going on with or without us, and he
he grabbed the last oxygen container.
I- I- I tried to reason with him. I...
but he attacked me... Viciously.
so... I killed him.
you didn't have a choice.
Yeah, if he'd taken your oxygen...
he would have not only killed you but the rest of your climbing team.
well, that works for me.
it was self-defense.
we're still stuck with Infeld's lie when he came down.
Hawke was a pillar of the community.
his scholarship endowment still sends hundreds of kids to college every year.
so to preserve that...
and protect his memory for his wife and kids...
... He lied to cover up the death of a man he killed with his own hands.
well, when you put it like that... Look, Infeld's trying to protect him.
would you want to be remembered for your worst moment?
say, the Halloween you went as Hannah Montana.
not my worst moment.
and I was dressed as Miley Cyrus.
if we're gonna admit that we lied about Hawke's death, then we have to make Infeld look like a Saint through the rest of his life.
dig up whatever you can.
already did.
it's not good.
what are you doing?
compiling character testimonials for Brett.
we got trouble. - What?
private bank account in the Bahamas.
Stanton's? - Hawke's.
closed out right around the time he died.
all right, well, could be nothing, but let's check it out.
and don't tell anybody.
we've started to put together the character wi-- oh, wow!
I'm sorry. I should have-- I should have knocked.
uh, I'll just, um, leave these?
relax. I, um, need your help with something.
okay.
it involves you looking at me.
I'm going on "Anderson Cooper," see if we can't influence the jury pool a little.
which outfit's better?
that works for me.
I need to look powerful and feminine but not provocative.
what about your character evidence?
testimonials on his honesty, his character for nonviolence, the charity work.
and they've all been subpoenaed?
done.
what was that, a couple of minutes ago?
what do you mean?
I heard you say not to tell anyone.
Yes. Jared had his first full body wax.
frankly, I think he took manscaping way too far. I told him, I said
Peter... Are you sure you're keeping me looped in about everything?
hold my hair.
you're totally looped. I swear.
I know you and Franklin bend the rules.
I won't have it, not on this case.
the stakes are too high.
of course.
and I want Karp off the trial team.
K-- wha-- Karp may have a stick up his ass, but he's a good lawyer.
Yeah, and he's also Stanton's nephew.
if he argues his innocence, the jury will think, "Of course he's saying that. He's family.
well, Jared and I will handle argument.
karp is better at motions, case citations
you mean boring, grown-up stuff that wins trials?
exactly. That's why we need him on the
Yeah, it's decided.
you and Franklin.
don't screw it up.
Hanna, I heard you signed Triple B Electronics. That's a huge get.
good news travels fast.
you know, I wanted to make sure that you're okay about not being on the trial team.
I pushed for you.
I am not gonna second-guess Stanton.
well, if you're ready to work where female partners are given more than lip service...
I'm happy here.
worth a shot. - Mm.
if you don't mind keeping this between us...
not a problem. - It's New York. Excuse me.
Hanna's gonna take over the case. Maybe she can get them to listen to reason.
who are these guys?
Dalton and Jacks, the league owners.
you should be represented by counsel, gentlemen.
unless he's your lawyer.
we're lawyers. - We're also...
then, who's this?
el presidente.
we are making him the next ultimo.
look, I know this is an emotional issue, but
uh, not for us. We own the league.
which means we own all the characters in the league, including Ultimo.
you like letting women speak for you?
I'll tell you what -- why don't you give me the mask, and I'll find you a skirt?
why don't you shut up? - Okay, Amelia.
they're just trying to get a rise out of us. Let's just stay calm.
that's weird. She wasn't too upset last night in my room.
why don't you say that to my face?!
you want to be a dead man?
I'll handle this, J.
and who's gonna teach me, huh? You, old man?!
soon. Someday soon.
I should be on this case.
if it were any other trial.
you're the most promising attorney.
Yeah, I could care less what you think of my lawyering.
but you do care what the judicial selection committee thinks.
wh-- h- how do you know
that you want to be a judge?
one of my law-school professors is on the committee.
I got you bumped up the list.
I'd prefer to keep it between us. It's a little sensitive.
you need to let me help my Uncle.
you want to help? Step aside.
it's the toughest thing to do. But sometimes, it's the smart move.
I found a croquet set.
where would you like it set up?
uh, on the south field.
Oh, wait a minute. The Rolling 40 Crips are playing softball now, aren't they?
listen, set it up 3: 00. - Yes, sir.
Hello, Damien. - Hi.
you-you heard that Brett took me off the case?
Yes, I'm -- I'm sorry, Damien.
but, you know, I hate to admit this, but she probably did the right thing.
Oh, by the way, I saw her last night on "AC360.
Wow! Is she ever compelling.
Stanton, this is serious.
look, appearances to the contrary, Damien... I am concerned.
but to be honest with you, I've been half-hoping that this day would come, when I could be judged for what I've done.
that was an honest moment.
there was, uh, no zen-master, Yoda-style deflecting.
the D. A. has to prove that Stanton Infeld killed Gibson Hawke.
I'll save her some time. He did.
he stabbed him, walked down the mountain, and lied about it.
that's the Stanton Infeld the D. A. wants you to know.
but you're gonna meet the real Stanton, the one I know, the one who sees the good in everyone and everything...
the Stanton Infeld who took a shot on two lawyers who were, well, let's just say, not setting the legal world on fire.
objection.
while I agree with Mr. Franklin's characterization of himself and his partner, uh, can he make one thing not about Franklin & Bash?
fair enough.
let's talk about two other people you'll hear from-- Mike Lane and Rachel Ford.
again, objection. Those witnesses haven't been provided.
that's because Mikey is 11 and Rachel's 9.
where are you going with this?
your Honor, obviously, Mike and Rachel were not on the mountain.
but their grandfathers -- both on the climb, since deceased after long, full lives -- were.
and had it not been for Stanton Infeld's heroism,
Mike and Rachel would have never known their grandfathers.
because Gibson Hawke would have killed everyone up there...
...including himself.
I got this in El Paso-- an exposed nail in the ring.
and how much time did you miss?
I fought the very next night.
we object to this testimony. It's irrelevant.
no one's disputing his commitment.
we thank him and invite him to take all the time he needs, starting now.
the contract -- - Let's forget the contract.
I'm sure she'd like that.
miss Linden, this is a court of law. We can't "forget" the contract.
all we're asking is that you look at the spirit of the contract.
I mean, we can't bargain for a man's dignity.
Ah, but you can for ownership of a character in the league.
Oh, wait. We did. Paragraph 2, subsection "b.
I'm sympathetic, but I'm bound by the law.
you may step down, sir. I'm sorry.
your Honor, please.
I am ordering all parties to return tomorrow so that you may return the mask.
Hey, make sure you wash the mask before you bring it back.
I'm an officer with the Alaskan Police Department, Denali District.
have you encountered the defendant, Stanton Infeld, before?
I have.
how do you know this guy?
I have no recollection.
and I think I would remember that mustache. It's quite impressive.
and where did the two of you meet?
at the Denali police station. I took his statement.
objection, Your Honor, we've already admitted that our client stretched the truth when he came down from the mountain.
duly noted, but this is something he said the night before they went up.
officer Werth, what were the circumstances that led you to take Mr. Infeld's statement?
it was in our drunk holding cell, after he had been booked for assault.
Mr. Infeld had been in a fistfight.
Oh, my! With whom?
your Honor, we have the defendant's booking photo from that night.
officer Werth, tell me
did Mr. Infeld say anything as he was being booked?
he was looking for Hawke.
he said, "If that son of a bitch doesn't pay up, he's a dead man.
well... He turned out to be as good as his word on that.
Objection!
withdrawn.
I didn't lie.
that looked a lot like you in the mug shot.
I'd ask,"How'd the other guy look?" But we kind of know.
honestly, I- I had forgotten.
how do you-- how do you forget an ass-whipping like that?
you don't know this about me. I used to live pretty hard.
I am from Liverpool.
I mean, I could never have just one drink or sleep with one woman.
or be second-best, ever!
I mean, I'd have a row the same way you guys squabble over oatmeal.
who fights over oatmeal?
Precisely!
you want to say it or should I?
you think he's guilty?
it's hard to argue self-defense when he called his shot three days before he did it.
sounds like specific intent to me.
we got the crap beat out of us in court today. We need something good.
Hey. Uh, come on in.
this is what they want.
do we really have to be there tomorrow?
Yeah, I'm sorry about what happened in court.
if you could just give us one second,
I'll, uh, figure out how to handle tomorrow, okay?
as far as Infeld's testimony -- - Dude, stop.
what? - She digs you.
God knows why, but, yeah, it looks like she does.
go comfort her. - We're in the middle of a case.
even Frodo took breaks when returning the ring to Mount Doom.
never mind that. Just go.
we've been at it all night. Take five.
Lucha used to just be his job. But when my mother died...
I'm sorry.
...he got wrapped up in his character.
I thought it was to avoid mourning.
then I realized that's how he mourned.
we're not giving up on this, Amelia.
it's not just about him.
being a Lucha fan isn't like rooting for the Lakers.
Ultimo stands for good.
he's a folk hero.
I know it sounds dumb, but it's-- - No, what it sounds like is awesome.
you don't meet many folk heroes.
you'd have made a good Luchador.
Yeah, I would have.
Yeah, but not as good as me,'cause I know all the moves.
you know all the-- - Mm-hmm.
all right. Bring it. Let's see. Break 'em out, Sally.
all right.
Oh, I could do that. Ow. Okay.
all right, that's effective.
Oh, wow! Okay. - There.
I could make you tap out in 15 seconds.
well, you could try, but-- okay!
I'm tapping out. There it is.
