they're no more your people than they are his.
but actually, I'm wearing it right now!
well, you said you wanted a more traditional relationship,
I want you to tell me the truth.
the best thing you can do for Clark is leave him.
I promise we'll be together, always and...
he can rule over all the Kandorians, even Zod.
this is our responsibility.
they were so close.
Ted Grant
Pemberton Sylvester
Kent Nelson
Wesley Dodds
alan Scott
we all do.
I'll finish it.
I can handle it.
who's that?
Clark?
data clone in progress with someone so nosy.

at a cost.
I've enjoyed that.
greetings.
we need to get it.
I do.
Courtney.

Lois?
Stripesy?
no.
this is business.
because of you?

I didn't answer.

this goes beyond honor.
he promised me.

my wife.
the team needs structure.
wait a minute. I know that guy.
the savior.
thank you.
what do you mean, "He's gone"?
it's stargirl.
who was she -- your partner?
you want to know why?
but you didn't, did you?
but I need you to be straight with me.
are you okay?
you were married?
Where's Clark?
what? Check what?
mind if I take a look?
agent Mercer.
careful, Lois.
into this, Nelson.
so is privacy.
Yeah.
called him his friend.
not nearly as much fun.
is that what we're lacking?
but no bullets.
Yeah.
as much as I hate to admit it, and she's counting on you.
no, no.
you have to trust them.
Thanks.
excuse me.
for what?
why me?
I love you.
according to Hawkman,
well, at least, thanks to you,
two?
loud and proud to be an American.
he said he had to show him something.
nothing yet.
I don't think so.
what's up?
like the one before that.
Hello?
but there is a limit.
reporter's intuition?
they don't even sound like criminals.
when they went after Dodds.
Hawkman, no!
Courtney Whitmore.
Oliver?
in the middle of all this.
before we go after Icicle .
those are classified.
not much.
amazon wish list.
what's that supposed to mean?
you don't have the talent gets you more than a slap on the wrist.
how's John?
some of us already have.
your point is?
she shouldn't be in the middle of this.
red, white, and blue.
I met one of them.
people never learn.
and then move on from there.
you know, it's not what happened to you.
how did they know our identities?
I wish I could remember
I will...
he'd do what I wouldn't.
I think I'm all set, Miss Sullivan.
and I don't want to add to that,But Clark said that the assailant
Hi, again.
back together?
I thought the Daily Planet,Clark.
no one's doing anyone a favor.

usually, we're a great team, and left a message that said
hard to believe?
No!
this generation will make come any closer.
on your head.
how's everyone else doing?
or I can take them from you.
to take a team like that out.
maybe.
I'm not good enough.
what's she doing here?
no, but I can find it, John.
I don't need my telepathy
isn't that what you said?
not as a team, anyway.
you mean what you've read.
and he'd be there for me.
he whispers. He could help.
I followed it.
and that's all you know?
no, he doesn't.
don't you think it's sad
it's none of their business.
why did you ask me to stay behind?
what is it we need to talk about?
stay down, Miss Sullivan.
are you all right?
but you...
no.
he didn't have any family.
you sure about that, Clark?

so by the time I got to met you,If I had to take a guess, like double super-classified.

instead of saving his own life.
Clark Kent's.
is more of a who than a what.
Hello?
almost sounds like you admire them.
Oliver?
two betrayed.
they need to make their own lives for any sign of Courtney.
I mean...
so I will continue to protect and serve,
why did you bring me here?
almost killed one of their enemies...
past lives?
So,you stuck around for Doctor Fate.
but they were as vague as you are.
send me your dry-cleaning bill.
before I got here today!
check...
you don't like it,

what are you doing to him?!
and I'll see if I can help Clark.
if it wasn't for them,
I got all 10 of them, Chloe.
nice.
I don't feel lucky.
I made too many mistakes.
and tear us apart like this?
did you put the call into the snow miser?
what's wrong? - Clark's gone.
why kidnap Courtney?
I wasn't looking for a quote,I

I've been playing phone solitaire.
for the last decade.

Oliver!
they know everything about us, Chloe.
and if he's anything like his father.
but that's what you do.
cases. Plural.
maybe...
you know, maybe it's time I gave up to the little newspaper that could?
Thanks, Lane.
Yeah, we've been playing phone tag.
stranger how?
but why now?
frosty's kid's going after you.
we're not going anywhere.
maybe this has all been a lost cause.
no.
send me your dinner bill.

I haven't heard from you in days.
so I just followed suit.
in case you need anything else.
on bringing the band back together.
what about you?
it is wrong, Courtney.
but this is a job for Clark Kent.
this is it, dad.
a young woman was killed.
who's coming?!
you know.
Yeah.
you need to go and warn Carter Hall.
they?
and they tried to protect one another.
on these little missions of yours
Hello?!
another twist to the mystery, Chloe.
shut up.
did you find one?
and chasing down Lois Lane.
I'm sorry.
I could use some dinner.
nothing, actually.
maybe they had families.

we may be a bit dysfunctional

you are the one he will need.
sandman doesn't dream anymore.

and a daughter.
and I've got my hands on a case
I appreciate the assist.

I'm trying to figure out who's behind all this.
I don't see it.

thank you for your time.
it was only then that I realized
Hey, wait!
don't waste your breath.
Where's my friend?
I mean, it was a family.
Hi, received a handful
there's not much more they can do for him.
daily Planet, Reporter, Clark Kent to how much knowledge someone can have.
Mr. Hall,
we have nothing else to say.
evidence would suggest that weapon
we could be like woodward and bernstein.
hopefully, we'll be seeing more of them.
but I prefer mine without clothes.
no bullets.
so you act like a jackass.
he wore some kind of weird uniform.
the Icicle's been in a vegetative state left to do with your life is throw it away.
does it matter?
Chloe?
the museum is closed.
Where's the Icicle now?
these old men have criminal records can be swept under the rug like that.
then why didn't you fight back?
what is this?
then I guess we'll just have to wait.
Pemberton knew about watchtower.
talking about these arrest reports,
doctor Fate was inundated and I'm gonna need them
at least he's supposed to be.
yours never did.
front page, Clark.
you can either hand those to me,
Carter Hall
Ah, fine. Dessert's on you.
someone's collecting them.
Sylvester said that.
you're the next generation.
and actually focus on the job here?
Lex is dead.
didn't think we'd have to dig this deep.
not yet.
it's time for the sandman
you know, those are some real party animals maybe he was on the run.
me?!
my name in print.
it's just a question of who.
line and sinker.
I rerouted the call through the hospital.
we should be able to catch him at Met Gen.
I guess not.
I think the coming generation.
you're a lot like him.
the rest of your team is out there.
should I even bother asking?
I was interviewing the cleanup crew
anyone home?
suspicious much?
Mr. Dodds?
there was honor among thieves.
friends?
Chloe, are you okay?
I want to take a closer look
maybe not.
he knew about us.
well, I don't know what that means.
these people really know what they're doing.
kids who are in it for the thrills
she's friends with Sylvester Pemberton.
it wasn't the throne that was important.
Oliver, we have to track it down.

where are the other superfriends?
they stood by one another,
that's Ted Grant.

he's the next name on Pemberton's call list.

what are you doing?! Get out of here!
what do you want?
this is the part where the doomed girl.
Jack frost nippin' at our toes.
I'd say that golden rod doesn't belong to you.
you're a little girl.
Sylvester said that, too.
print is dead.
Courtney, I'm sorry about Doctor Fate.
mostly less.
it's getting stranger.
but I'm still trying to set up and hard to wrangle at times.
as I could.
check what?!
I have seen it.
there's a reason for that.
maybe she knew what Sylvester Pemberton
maybe your team would operate better
is Mister terrific still terrific?
not that I don't mind a good mud bath,
our cold-blooded cryo-killer
that turned violent.
and I got to say that Abigail Hunkel had hidden up his star-covered sleeve.
she froze from the inside out with the great Lois Lane?
if someone's killing criminals from the past,
but there were other bad guys
I've read your work.
no.
I thought you said it didn't hurt. - I lied.
okay, then.
they made those up!
is putting a lot of weight on your shoulders,
well, maybe if you had laced up your boots
we're gonna need him, Nelson.
the same mistakes the last one did...
to talk to the police, given your past, but I
I heard my wingman.
I understand that you'd be reluctant
then a bus ran through a mud puddle.
well, everything we've heard about you guys 10 to 1 says pigeon man's got Clark
I don't know who the hell these people are,
we need to start taking this more seriously.
to fight the good fight, right?
he's gonna need to replenish his abilities
agent Waller.
you know, being boyfriend.
still waiting for them to ping me back.
right. Let me run a few more tests on this.
we're telling jokes now?
and he fell off.
I'm not his sidekick.
Clark?
red, white, and blue.
I'm interested in you.
what's next for you?
a work in progress.
who are you supposed to be, sweetie?
you're the one they call watchtower.
call you back.
who is that? Who is that?
he had no prior criminal record
I'll be in touch.
hide what?
you miss your family...
Clark, it's okay. No apology is needed.
what?
and you know the mailroom here.
he's gone bowling.
the justice society of America
the atom is split.
no, he doesn't.
the new star-spangled kid?
on my way to interviewing
he did.
that means, at some point, they broke apart.
God, I hate waiting.
like one of Pemberton's old gang
they took my father!
we" meaning "me," right?
they who?
he needed my help.
no.
I'm sorry. I've been meaning to call.
I just want to make sure you have all my contact info?
Pemberton's home address right now.
if doctor Fate says he's okay.
we're too late.
but you would not believe the morning I just had.
great.
with some sort of standardized trouble alert.
is a little blurry when it comes to justice.
is more than enough to juggle.
you're buying, Mr. Queen.
to know you run that risk yourself.
she's a sophomore at Blue Valley High.
he called him over a dozen times in the last two days.
how is he involved with these guys?
you will triumph over him.
it's missing something.
you could say that.
on the mystery men the old-fashioned way.
they wanted us to unmask.
I checked Lois's car and apartment.
and to think I was actually looking forward.
my taxi ran out of gas.
I can finish what I started...
that means he's okay, right?
we're both trying to bring a team together.
Oh, but it is.
to breakfast with the Daily Planet's looking for a new lease on life
I admire their loyalty.
they're the best friends that I have, Carter.
goodbye, father.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Sylvester Pemberton worked with 12 other known criminals,
what is this reverse halloween?
he's still recovering from some serious injuries locked in a birdcage somewhere.
which actually looked pretty good.
security cameras caught him at the hospital,
you knocked on their door.
an official meeting with our supergang.
you wouldn't have kept watch over all of this.
justice?
what are you -- my chaperone?
is that my E-mail?
what's your excuse?
what is it, Chloe?
I always thought it would be hard for you,I've never had a connection like that.
Mr. Hall?
it's ridiculous.
on Mars, we never had dessert, beyond Sylvester Pemberton's rap sheet.
well, I couldn't find anything online.
you're way out of practice.
and I had a family.
at the bottom of trash cans.
they'll become the next Doctor Fate.
so the killer was some kind of meta-human
several times over the last few days.
Hello? Hello?
that were railroaded out of business.
my friend is very sick.

I was looking for Carter Hall.
haven't you vultures done enough to Sylvester?
where Icicle might show next.
visiting his father last night -- target one.
the helmet.
haven't eaten, haven't slept,
I've got one or two.
Why?
I think the same place they took Courtney.
that's Sylvester Pemberton.
this was my chance.
I'm expecting a package myself.
but you love talking.
if it's so double super-classified, don't let the torch that he kept burning .
but given our last few encounters.
do I know you?
I know it's wrong.
there was frostbite around the bullet wounds can actually come out of the mothballs
Oliver. You got my message.
it's him, isn't it?
the justice society lives again.
I've made mistakes, but I haven't quit.
in excavation at the Daily Planet archives.
I hope I didn't make you cry.
this is Clark,Please leave a message.
you will help everyone embrace it.
it's not every day that you get an exclusive
just for the record, you started it.
I asked them to.
who's the him?
you're lucky a friend did it first.
all right.
back in Pemberton's day, but you already decided to go it solo today,
I grew up in Chicago, Icicle.
do you even know who you're working with here?
that the line disappeared altogether.
she hasn't been to school in the last three weeks.
if it isn't my favorite Martian.
I just need to look at their computer.
you know, I only learned to fly
no.
I'm thinking we should regroup with the others.
you get used to it.
breaking and entering into police lockup.
Jay Garrick, a research scientist.
was released from prison secretly.
why did they have to team us up together?
what they did to you so they went after us hard.
I think they've been tracking us a long time, Clark.
someone worthy will be drawn to it.
so, what? You're expecting the Kandorians
well, it belongs to me now.
he knew our identities.
cause no one's been able to answer why.
nobel prize-winning tech guru Michael Holt.
do you believe in fate, Lois?
Chloe helped Courtney and I.
it would have been a lot smoother if you hadn't thrown up.
protecting the streets of Metropolis.
I scared them away.

Jay, Ted, Alan.
the sentient power.
when he checked in, he was still knee-deep.
but I don't know if we'll ever be what the JSA was.
you are invaluable, Clark Kent.
this is personal.
well, it sounds like fun.
what?
left the letters J-S-A.
Clark?
next time.
over the Metropolis sky 10 minutes ago.
I mean, they'd even spend thanksgivings there.
I saw too much.
it's been decades.
you're my family here.
arrested for assaulting police officers.
it's hard to believe that a group of underdogs.
let me just cut to the chase, lite-brite.
that's mission accomplished, Icicle.
I came by to talk to you about a few of your friends，but they sure don't like us.
I killed you.
but when the chips are down, we're always there, Chloe.
we help oursel!
back into the public eye.
but my own.
what do you suppose this was -- their getaway car?
and he had a long criminal record.
your fate is in my hands.
you embrace the truth.
Hawkman and Green Aarrow, aka the new partner.
bank records...
I'm sorry about your friend.
so it should be easy to spot.
you were smarter when you were leaving.
go home.
Oh, yeah, I got a peek inside lockup.
who are you?
no more pairing off.
green Arrow went after him. - And John?
who do you blame for her death?
he'll live.
who are you?
he's a heavyweight champion, but so why don't you take the death wish and shelf it?
my wife.
she's standing under a streetlight.
you don't know anything about my past, kid.
was to restore my martian abilities
maybe you pulled me out of juvie.
they don't know how to lace up their own boots.
really don't want to get the police involved in this, do you?
my friend was murdered.
with an icy touch?
we're in danger.
but the doctor is out.
thank you.
don't give up on us yet.
the sooner I see my wife again.
for putting dear old in traction, right?
from those of us that have done it before.
you were hooked.
green Arrow has pretty good aim.
your team is better than I thought, too.
and I'm burning up, damn it!
No!
see, this is why I keep asking everybody to come up
the ice samples we pulled from the first victim's wounds you have as friends.
the two people that were murdered for as long as we could.
while trying to protect them.
doctor Fate?
Yeah, and we don't know anything about them.
the cold doesn't bother me.
we tried our best to stay out of the public eye.
what do you mean?! He can't be dead!
what?
Carter, please.
what do you know about this?
satellites caught the glow of that staff using every tool I've got.
and I guess it's everything you could ever ask for.
she's all dolled up with no place to go.
I know what kind of hero you are, Green Arrow.
he needed your help, and now there's a young girl out there,
someone else is bound to pull out one of those cords
what is wrong with you people?
have human DNA.
I wonder if he does horoscopes.
how did you get on the case, Lois?
Pemberton's glow stick is missing.
you've been out of the game too long, Doc.
was covered with ice, just like Wesley Dodds'.
I don't know.
you and I share something in common.
we only help ourselves, Nelson.
Hawkman and the justice society
I should probably stay out of the sandbox.
just residual ice again.
me too.
what would Shiera have done?
his name was Sylvester Pemberton,
you're really on a kick lately, Chloe.
if we don't team up and stop the Icicle, with their spouses and kids.
well, at first, I put it on, you know, just to annoy Pat.
it was like a family.
the truth will set you free.
a golden helmet possessed by ancient spirits.
no looking, no looking.
including Wesley Dodds.
time to go hunting.
the crimes don't match who they are.
her name was Inza.
Clark and Lois. - Lois and Clark.
here's his phone. - All right.
uh, sure.
when Sylvester had asked you to, he might still be alive!
and the truth will set you free.
they were criminals, and they were caught. That's what happened.
how badly I wish I could remember, Carter.
this job should have been finished years ago.
fate is a fatal thing.
come on, then.
fraud, embezzlement, and assault.
can't help but wonder what happened to these people.
where would they take him?
was slipping off your priority list.
you don't even know who we are.
but I did it anyway.
I'm only helping them find their place here.
we're not asking you to.
drop the mace, Conan.
sealed records.
I mean, it'd be a shame to miss your junior junior prom.
haven't quit?
Yeah.
what my life was like before Doctor Fate.
where are the pictures...
you know, you really got to work on your landings.
if you didn't,
so, what do you call your team, anyway?
somebody, help!
its magic.
Clark's at the Daily Planet trying to track down.
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
looks like you're enjoying the return of your powers.
and...
I'm sorry that I was out, Lois, but maybe I can assist you.
what brings the big boss all the way downtown?
personal phone conversations...
or you could just try the handle.
you're making this too personal.
who's this your secretary?
now, I'm not supposed to know this...
I see your fate, Lois Lane.
he sustained several years ago.
he's not here.
but their capacity for hope
no more waiting.
there's a murderer on the loose.
he was killed by ice was to get a shot at the justice society.
we refused to play ball,
Hey, congratulations.
who was the justice society of America?
Clark, we're playing too fast and loose.
Sylvester wanted to bring together
maybe it's a calling card.
we did.
I read Sylvester's coroner report.
and in the end, doesn't exactly strike fear in this hero's heart.
excuse me.
incoming communication Green Arrow.
we're not a team.
someone named the Icicle.
Sylvester Pemberton called your phone.
who are you?
don't look at me,I'm living off a policeman's salary.
why what, green punching bag?
not all of them, my friend.
I used to have special abilities like Clark.
I'm his protegee.
what the...
I was wondering how they got here.
but without the aid of the helmet of Nabu.
I was already transferred to three different prisons.
the one who will lead us all...
let's just hope the prime murder suspect hasn't.
when he got a job in the police department and became a detective.
it was with a guy named Wesley Dodds.
I, uh, I thought I'd stop by and see if anyone was hungry.
although Lex Luthor is your ultimate opponent, the world now knows who these heroes are.
but the end result, we can't begin to guess.
my time as a detective
you go back to sherwood, Robin Hood.
when this is over,
well, at least I'm proud of something other than myself.
we were cursed by one of our enemies.
each one of them tried to take the fall for the other.
Chloe, they have no connections besides their arrests.
he is the one you will need.
only the kind you make happen.
Kent Nelson. Dr. Kent Nelson.
and you said no.
but the real question is, are you okay?
metropolis General Hospital full of classified intel
the winged warrior here threw me through a window.
more or less.
what kind of a team was this, Clark?
there's an army of heroes growing.
is greater than any I've ever encountered.
what was that drama about?
he was accused of embezzling from his own company.
Oliver Queen said that there are two dead.
I do know what it's like to feel like the only thing
miss Whitmore?
and plugs into so many outlets,
greetings, Hawkman.
definitely seems to have a score to settle.
Yeah.
and witness what might be.
this doctor named Emil had him transferred to a secured room.
I'm well aware of the capabilities
I know. When Hawkman heard, he flew off.
our victim's name is Sylvester Pemberton, but he did have a friend show up at the hospital.
I wouldn't have all this blood on my hands.
and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
his final phone call lasted 30 minutes.
the helmet has something to say.
if you didn't get together only when there was trouble...
you got them back into the game,
you are that hope.
Hawkman began crossing the line so many times
he was wearing a gold-plated helmet and a cape,
Lex?
what Checkmate started.
with a helmet head that can tell you your fate.
he told you your fate?
you don't want anyone to know how important they are to you.
the door was open.
that a secret society of retired supervillains
he'll go after them next.
but I'm still in my prime.
arrested for aiding and abetting.
accusations of jury tampering.
and the watchtower are two entirely different things.
star rocket racer.
I want to speak to her...now!
just stay the hell away from me.
like we've always had to.
uh, no, phone tag implies two people.
this is not what I signed up for.
big sister's watching.
you're right.
you said that the skin around Pemberton's wounds.
Tess Mercer.
between me and canary were purely Platonic.
but a government task force.
and Dodds was killed the same way as Pemberton?
we have a lot to catch up on.
you know, you're lucky he didn't drop you from 10 stories up.
well, if he knew someone was after him,
now, stay the hell out of our business.
I'm sorry I was late for breakfast, Smallville,
they can get things a bit mixed up.
from someone or something.
I say we get some reinforcements,
I guess I haven't been having many problems.
well, I only know it ends.
Sylvester Pemberton, Wesley Dodds.
right? Hawkgirl?
he was a cryo-kinetic hit man that was called the Icicle.
look at Kent Nelson, Courtney.
and I'll give you my version of a slap on the wrist.
if we're going to survive the apocalypse left my father brain-dead.
watchtower?
he mentioned bringing a team back together.
let me show you, my friend.
I'm guessing you were one of them.
it is not your fate to die this day, Martian.
people I didn't know.
I heard you were working on some kind of murder case.
they took Clark out from under our noses.
it was like the worst code name ever.
at this glowing staff the police have in evidence.
he had a weapon that could control light.
John and Fate are scouring the nitrogen depots.
you haven't started.
can we skip your virtual love life
maybe they didn't deserve to die.
Chloe, I'll have you know that those messages
who was he?
then let me finish it.
there's over a dozen members of the justice society
we should have stuck together from the beginning.
that are holding you down, Clark.
after the justice society, agent Waller.
so, you're not actually related to any of them?
he's in the psych ward at Metropolis General.
when someone like you reaches out
Clark, they were vigilantes like the blur.
the next time, I won't ask so nicely.

Yeah.
the first time I ever saved someone...
Carter Hall's definitely hiding something else in that museum.
they took the only family I have left away.
maybe...
now I'm ready.

I did you a favor.

they forced us out of the skies and off the streets.

just give me a sec to get this door open.
but...
you don't do this for glory or vengeance.
this generation and the last are coming together,
when you saw my fate, what did you see?
once we find the Icicle, we'll fade back away.
we all have to keep trying.

I wasn't the leader they thought I was.
then let me be specific.
there were missing witnesses, circumstantial evidence, when everything got turned upside down,
it wouldn't have worked, Courtney.
they wanted us to work for them.

so, this is where you guys operate?
but it always ends.
Hey, Oliver, what do you got?
he was just babbling about how I'd be there for him.
why have you been watching us?
that's all I needed you to do.
about how to get the stains out of this jacket.
Mr. Hall, I'm Clark Kent from the Daily Planet.

Clark, this is Chloe with message number one-too-many.

well, family is not just about blood.
it's been a long time.
you will soar higher than any one of us.
you don't think blondie's our killer, do you?
will come to pass.
think of me as your parole officer but with a mace.
now, I haven't spoken to Pemberton or Dodds in years.
is it just me, or did it get really cold really fast?
because revenge is a dish best served cold.

Shiera and I were born over 1, 000 years ago.
John seems to be undergoing some kind of incubation,
the people being murdered were our teammates, our friends.
with all due respect, we're making it our business.
Sylvester always told me that the JSA's brownstone
you need to go check it out.
it's obvious you still care about this team.
I've only just begun to take away them.
Oh, the kids out there playing hero are hardly a team.
they'll make mistakes.

to finally have a good night's sleep.
his path is righteous.
I can still take down the JSA single-handedly.
you were their leader.
that's because it is personal, Waller.
but you sacrificed them to save Clark Kent.
maybe you two really are perfect for each other.
that means Courtney probably does, too.
welcome to the suicide squad.
add to that you're now leading the secret city of Kandor.
you will lead this generation.
so I got out, like a good soldier, and I pushed.
nothing a cup of hot cocoa and a nap won't fix.
with hope for tomorrow.
or I guess I should say, it's on my head.
I only say because I care.
get Clark, throw them through some windows.
it messed with my mind,It screwed me up.
I killed everyone you asked me to,You don't know who we are either.
as do I.
but I don't know where they are anymore.
if that's true, there's no way he can be our killer.
for one reason hope.
the JSA has always done the right thing.
you and Clark, Oliver...
or, you know, a place to sit down and eat?
he's charged with fraud and resisting arrest.
the sandman and the star-spangled kid are both dead.
Oliver's searching all over the city
and if you made it a little more home, sweet home
I'm getting some serious wall of weird flashbacere, Clark.
the byline could have read, "Lois Lane and Clark Kent.
no, but I do think she knows something.
I know that you have a lot of things pressing right now.
I look into the window of the future.
even I have to admit.
you're not like the others, are you, Clark?
Clark Kent is not like the others.

Yes.
of course it is.
Yeah. - Thanks.
and it isn't fair,
I guess.
and for you, sir?
Oh, good.

uh, yeah. Okay.
now, you just calm down.
somebody stole my comic book!
and you can keep sitting there,
just tell me when,
I mean my pad.
I have lots of fun.
not that I can blame him.
spit it out, Clark.
sorry.
Oh, you know,
I don't.
the cops are still looking for him.
I have a feeling
you see, that's Alec talking.
I can't believe I asked that.
Yeah, piece of cake.

sorry.
great.
it's about sacrifice,
Lois.
I just need to ask you a few
it's the birth of a villain.
but I think that's it.
just tell me where your friend is
we're having fun, right?
until you showed up.
of what being a hero's all about.
I'm cashing in a rain check.
how about flight?
like you said, I'm already late, so...
so, uh...
we need to talk.
of course.
out here in the real one, kid.
come on.
remember how that feels
that's the whole point!
take a picture?
you've got like a million tells
you only get to frown that much "I wish I could be a hero"
and you think this stolen comic book about being on the road for so long,
all right.
well, it's a living.
I can't do this.
I promise.
under magical duress.

it shouldn't be hard for Lois Lane

now?
I would look ridiculous.
that sounds hard.
and you wouldn't look me in the eye
Oliver, what's up?
I'm an orphan,
he's just looking for someone - No. - Yes.
even though we live lives
Hey, Harry,
get your hands off of the digital world doesn't mean you should.
Lois, can I rain check on your rain check?
and we'll have him home by breakfast.
that would compromise their identities.
all right, fine.
stop gawking and prosper.
I had to look inside,
Nope.
but this isn't real, Alec.
it's like everyone has a popcorn image
are you for real?
no one can.
little...
as a potential story.
but I'm in the truck, on the way there now.
and you don't know anything about me!
bumpy day?
I don't think anyone can fault you
day in, day out.
now, that wasn't so hard, was it?
Chloe? - I'm fine.
maybe my therapist was right, you know?
but it's not what I meant to happen.
we're gonna get you back to normal.
don't worry.
what?
less gabbing, more grabbing.
you mind if I get a picture with you?
and focus on your work.
I'm sorry.
okay.
slow night?
that there is some goodness in there.
Clark, where are you?
and I got sent to Metropolis
we don't get to take breaks.
good luck.
that would make you meta-human.
Thanks, mister!
I just have a few things I need to look in to.
or maybe we could order some pizza or
how's Chloe?
there isn't anything wrong
and according to Zatanna's research...
this is not what I had in mind and now not so much as a dirty limerick
from what I've heard.
about the fact that she was really stressed out
like you.
and you made sure that my decaf, caramel, that's gonna make a lick of difference might do you some good every once in a while.
you don't know anything about my parents,
for the first time in a while...
are you okay?
that I am soaking wet with disappointment.
but I was rethinking what I said and you smelled like a magazine insert.
look, if I get up,
I'll bet you do.
but your lady magician
you know...
what's your dream?
they were big in the '90s.
what do you need?
that I find it highly ironic
so, while I was waiting for you to nail down a human-interest piece here.
I can't get anything out of these people.
and that's how you got your powers,
no.
now, that's a showstopper.
just a minute!
it's common to the archetype.
to drag your heels across the county line,
well, you can tell your supervisor
exactly.
that look on your face
no wonder Clark's been avoiding me.
you really know superheroes?
the reality of being a hero,
I get to pick out your costume.
with powers like yours,
and then I can slap him with a counter curse
I don't really think about it.
so, were you exposed to meteor rock?
holy crap.
maybe I'm not letting loose
Lois.
I can fly?
Lois, Zatanna.
you're still in there. Think about your parents, Alec.
in finding my fantasy somewhere else.
what do I do now?
what was she dressed up as, anyway?
want to know why?
not jealous, not even a little.
watching me have all the fun you're not having.
maybe you need to look ridiculous.
Yeah.
he becomes a monster.
don't think I haven't been trying.
it's called a fantasy, Clark
it's new to me right now.
stop it!
it's all in a day's work.
all right. A deal's a deal.
like a bully before?
good street look, though.
doing what?
without a dash of fantasy,
looks like our little juvy is in desperate need
no. I get it.
mighty!
unstoppable!
I got a bunch of new games I think you might like.
salute the flag?
you think that they would want their little boy
more handsome!
save the hammer. Mama's gonna need a crowbar.
you cannot renege on a rain check.
of course I don't.
cross my heart.
and a single malt.
sorry, Lois, I just don't get all this
right there with you.
I know that you stole a cursed comic book invades your personal space.
it's worth thousands and thousands of dollars.
secret origins revealed! A tale of true power.
Ooh, geez.
so I can stop her.
than what we have in our normal lives.
I'll catch you.
and I guess I got caught up in my own stuff so much
the police are the least of his worries.
Zatanna...Lois.
I know a superhero when I see one.
but whatever.
that's what was in your bag?
no, no, no, no, no, no! Hey!
when you blow through town.
I'm normally a solo act,
abracadabra.
I don't get why you didn't want to come up here.
can you at least tell me which heroes you know?
you can't make me.
Clark, for a guy without a single poker face,
you all right?
that last one was a joke.
when's the last time you had any fun?
to understand what he's going through.
it's right in front of your face.
I know,
which is saying something.
she said I used to have these fantasies about Clark,
look, I'm sorry. I'm late.
hoping to teach the publisher a lesson.
was there a memo?
you know, the test of a true hero
pretty cool.
we can use watchtower to track him down.
apologize! - Okay!
so, your friend Zatanna,
this isn't the origins of a superhero.
my boss would kill me.
target aquired. Maniac with boomerangs... Hooray. Queen Oliver.
the rare "Warrior Angel" comic book.
I know. My friend Zatanna told me.
which was the truth and totally still is the truth,
magic, fantasy
you're gonna get burned again.
that's what being a kid is all about.
is an apology.
did you bring enough for the rest of the class?
according to my dad's journal,
he's been A. W.O. L. ever since he stole the book, that no one in the whole wide world knows
you hear that?!
most of them, I guess.
Yeah, you can.
so, if I'm gonna help you get acclimated,
Oh, I think we're a little late to the party.
do you promise to answer all my questions?
no one can ever hurt me again!
you just have to want to see it.
back of the line, buddy!
was that a clever play on words?
that I didn't realize she'd gotten so close to me.
as flattered as I am...
come on! Get up here!
can't find my guest of honor yet.
well, if anyone can relate, it's me.
okay! I'm sorry!
expect the unexpected.
that everyone else thinks are fantastic
I like to call it angel hearing.
from the real world every now and then.
it's not as crazy as it sounds.
or maybe you were actually born this way.
Lois, we need to find him as soon as we can.
Yeah, well, I had a really good night.
maybe I'm doing this to myself.
Oh, thank God!
Yeah.
and a hero's work is never done.
look, whether you feel like it or not,
my name is not Alec.
and remember the next time you run into a bully
well, the computer's doing a facial-recognition search in missing persons.
powers -- what's under the hood?
what was that whooshing sound?
you're welcome, citizen.
so...
come on! I need that to get home!
why do you keep doing that?
there's a monster at the end of the book.
doesn't mean we don't get to take a break "With angels' might!
just listen, when you've been sweating like a pot roast all afternoon.
Hey, buddy! Wait your turn!
how do I know when to let go?
Zatanna, when did you
I'll let you know if I find anything.
jealous women worry. Me?
not the smoothest.
I can't see a thing in this helmet.
this isn't something a hero would do.
she's... into antiquities.
I can fly!
Yeah. Now, let's just focus on
especially.
he is the most honest man that I know.
in a chemical fire,
you're my hero.
and you couldn't sound more bored.
so I wouldn't get bullied at school.
I wish I could be a hero like you what the Warrior Angel's secret battle cry is.
Oh, sorry.
getting swept away in a little fantasy
it's just strong, is all.
ladies first.
everything's gonna be okay.
everything okay?
so I could have saved my parents.
no, you're not.
look, my friend Zatanna can reverse this curse, okay?
this is everything I ever wanted!
come on.
and I know you're a lot younger than you look, Alec.
they stole the idea from a friend of Zatanna's father.
but you might want to duck and cover in there.
with having another hero on the street, right?
you're right.
cause everyone's worth saving.
I've spent so much time trying to do what's right
you're not actually from space, are you?
well, you certainly seem to be in good spirits.
well, let me assure you that this will never happen again.
and now I'm finally a hero, and I won't go back.
but the publisher never opened the comic book,
it is.
I just have to get used to the reality
a girl might just start to crush on you.
bring our girl home.
Yeah, I'm about as real as it gets.
is it true that no one's ever read it before?
Yeah.
I have been cleaning up his mess,
stephen Swift.
Kent Farm
all of them?
just, uh, owed Lois some sharks tickets.
with you, Lois.
or is it just pride in a job well done?
responsibility, and accountability.
right now, everything's under control.
normal?
your world is so much better than mine.
she's been better.
and I'd love to return the favor.
among the world's finest over coffee sometime.
see you later. - Thank you.
mind your own business!
I used to think heroes weren't real
that...
come on!
I do, too.
so, uh, why do you do it?
so, if anything were to happen
not very heroic.
wait! No!
it would be hard for even the most distressed damsel there's a, um, costume ball.
it's all about your heart.
sometimes you got to take your fun
there's a few leads that she wants me to help her track down.
when we were tracking down a lead for the comic,
you know, maybe we can talk about how you fit in
at the end of the con every year,
well... based on my last relationship,
yeah? It's new for me, too.
I just had the truck window open.
the company that published the "Warrior Angel" comic book,
am I interrupting something?
we need to talk, Clark. Alone.
it -- it was --it was just an accident.
security! Security!
that's -- that's amazing is what it is.
uh, a glass of milk would be great.
see, I know that I have nothing to worry about
Mr. Blur's really upped his game.
we have to give this a whirl.
you know actual superheroes
so, you got caught up in the moment.
where you can get it.
I can't believe I'm doing this!
Chloe, if we can figure out what he looks like as an adult, and neither did anyone else --not until yesterday.
no. I've never even touched Lois' Xbox.
I don't know -- they just don't get it.
holy crap!
I just wanted to get to you first so you wouldn't freak out.
stephen Swift?
that you decided to follow in your father's footsteps.
that's a shame.
you know, after that heroic hit-and-run,
come on.
when the last time I had a good time was,
I mean, who wouldn't?
not the last, right?
Lois Lane would be the first to know about it,
have a little fun. One of us should.
that I can't find anyone worth talking to to stargaze with at the end of the day.
when you said you wanted to come upstairs.
there is when he's just a kid.
now, I have to go make a phone call.
what? Why would you think I could
what you're doing to this kid here isn't right
well, this isn't the reaction I expected.
it must be love.
all in a day's work, I guess.
uh, sure...
luckily, I'm driving by the Talon right now, Lois.
wonderful wit and sparkling theatrics.
I'll give it back! Just put me down!
just like in the comic.
on your way over here for the quick change.
and sometimes...
Nah, nah, you know better than that.
I-I didn't realize how fast I was.
let me preface this by saying that she is just a friend.
Lois, you know, you don't have anything to worry about and he shouldn't let you get away with it, not ever!
lady's got a point.
I like the "S" better.
but... seeing through walls
Lois, it's not like that.
let's just focus on what makes Stephen Swift so super.
not surprised your dad's friend had trouble selling this.
I think I have a spell for that.
and I didn't have an answer.
I was wondering how long it would take you to fess up.
the next time one of your sexy lady friends that I'm not the only gal that thinks you're fantastic.
well, there's a catch, too,
meet Alec Abrams, our preteen pre-convict.
that's when you let go.
I'm sort of in the business of helping superheroes.
but you, buddy...
just being like this is almost like breathing now.
think this through. You want to be a hero, right?
my father put a curse on the original comic,
Oh. What would a hero say?
though I still don't understand how this qualifies as Amazon,
I'm good, thanks.
or maybe you're from space.
normal means not having the power to defend myself.
Lois, maybe you just need to calm down
you know, I must have gotten my signals mixed.
I mean, if -- if you're not doing anything.
I hope it's okay that I borrow him for a bit.
that's just how she dresses some
managed to get the charges dropped against Alec.
so, what's next?
let me go, please! Put me down!
in order to exact some old-world retribution,
Oh, my God. He is just a boy.
that I guess I haven't had any time for anything but reality.
and then a couple weeks ago, I got caught in a
no one starts out wanting to be the bad guy.
and I didn't really know what you looked like then,
aunt? How old's our thief?
as ready as it's gonna be.
if you found out your hero was really a 12-year-old,
I certainly didn't think this is what you meant
dark, black, please.
I'm afraid I'm keeping Lois at arm's length.
lethal enforcers are way more interesting.
a story finally happened right under my nose.
promise me you're gonna kick the crackberry to the curb.
right there in between the beats.
you're afraid that if you let that spark ignite,
you keep trying not to smile, like, the whole night.
I-I mean coffee.
I mean, you've saved me more than once now,
listen, about Zatanna, Lois, I
look, you're gonna find a way to get through this, okay?
what is that?
we course-corrected when our thief's aunt filed a report.
that she knew the family of the original author.
not because I have to but because I choose to.
because every time I do, things fall apart.
just because you can do something
no. You have been cashing in so many rain checks lately
no.
need-to-know basis.
there's gonna be a panel starting in 20 minutes.
attention please! Attention please!
rounding up all of the things that he cursed.
you obviously haven't seen the line for the women's room.
help yourself, professor.
why didn't she say something?
to live with my aunt when I was...
and, well, here we are.
when Randall said I got to be embedded journalist for the day.
they keep looking at me like I'm from another planet...
he kept sending letters to the post office
I'll give you something to laugh about.
sparks lead to flames,
I think I always gain a bit of perspective
excuse me, Ms. Sullivan.
I could swear there's a twinkle of magic in your eyes...
remember how you said magic wasn't an exact science?
is not letting the sadness and the loneliness take over.
warrior Angel was really just a kid?
what happens if I fall?
I'm sorry. This is all kind of new to me.
I guess you can't expect magic to be an exact science.
but if I so much as breathe at it funny...
would you excuse me one moment?
especially when you have superpowers.
I'm gonna finish my apology now.
everybody... home, now!
but aren't you at least curious what's inside?
running a little light on allegory tonight.
are you sure we can't keep this team-up rolling?
please tell me your counter curse is ready to go.
uh, and you left a not-so-subtle trail of bread crumbs
his I. D. was flagged in the planet database
you know, maybe it's a deep-rooted fear of intimacy.
and on to some hunky human fantasy for a change.
but, hey, at least you have that fiery space trooper no one's gonna push me around ever again.
I suppose even the illusionist can become disillusioned.
I think we found a mouth more magical than mine.
Yeah. I thought I was the expert.
I found out my late, great father got cocky
uh, Lois, why are you in the men's bathroom?
I was just trying to give you some perspective, Clark.
can you grab something from my place while you're at it?
but these things never seem to end well,
do you have any idea how much my actual life sucked?
that sounds...
I am losing touch with fantasy without even realizing it.
anybody opens that book, the value drops.
I've never felt like a -- like a
Lois, it's just this whole thing with us is
how would you have reacted?
you've got to let me take a look at this!
I don't know how many wands she had to wave, how can you possibly say "all in a day's work"?
I always knew you were packing some heavy artillery under that tie, life's just life, and where's the magic in that?
and my dad really outdid himself on this one.
we'll cover more ground if we split up anyway, right?
you heard the man! Leave him be!
sorry my locator spell wasn't more accurate.
normal means being whaled on at school every day.
I just figured I'd squeeze in some target practice...
I just had to... save the day.
life can be pretty hard on you sometimes, huh?
did you and Chloe both just swear off whimsy?
our thief is bound to be feeling the effects of true power,
before I go, I want to give you something.
it sucks.
in the original story, Warrior Angel becomes Devilicus.
the last thing Clark feels when he thinks about you is boredom.
I'm sorry. I don't know what happened.
well, this Amazon princess won't get nerd-walled again.
look, a costume isn't just about hiding who you are.
now, that, my friend...
based on the age progression from Alec's photo.
did you want to get that coffee now or, uh...?
he should be... close?
okay. This is what I got -- some red leather thing.
now, these people out here with their capes, and fire... doesn't always have to burn, you know.
did you want to...
this place is awesome. It's way cooler than my room.
make sure she knows just how lucky she is, Clark.
do you think that I like... Being insecure?
what I create as everyone else's fantasies the curse should have turned Alec into a full-grown hero.
if I were Chloe, I'd try to fix it myself.
addressed to "the blur."
but that armor doesn't exactly make you Ms. Approachable.
your standard superspeed, enhanced strength,
when did we drift from missing comic to missing persons?
I wrote this when you were still red and blue,
I do it because I want to help people...
just -- sorry.
which is more than I can say for the two of you.
but, um...I guess I got caught up with some... chores,
no sonic boom. So, not that fast, I guess.
which is why us superfriends got to stick together.
to remind you what sparks are all about.
have become so... normal.
this is who I am now, and I won't go back.
an escape, something, I don't know, more magical
fantasy isn't about being in control,
besides, there's nothing in that fantasy world
not exactly what I meant about being swept away.
and the moment our hero feels the slightest bit betrayed...
now...
it's about seeing the world in a way that you haven't before.
like I said, I need all the help I can get.
you asked me what my dream was, and it's this...
I don't think anyone's dad talked about that on career day.
and maybe you should take advantage of being immersed in your element.
I don't want to hurt you, Chloe, but I will if I need to.
and with a gift like that comes responsibilities.
about not understanding...Fantasy
somehow I don't think you detoured your road show to play catchup.
between... the farm boy and lady fishnets,
Where's your bag?
Siobhan!
bedtime.
Really? - No.
where?
that was mine.
okay, stop.
got him.
I'll go check on Clark.
Oh, come on, ollie.
over here.
I want to help.
I'm starving.
with that hair.
and there's no wound.
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
nice one.
to come into the bathroom like that?
I fixed the pipe.
okay, sure.
is called holiday.
the truck is still there.
Bye, Chloe.
what are you doing in here?
Oliver and I are not a couple.
Oliver's not in our room.
we're no flowers.
sit with us.
had it coming.
for my competition.
Oh, god.
I figured Lois wanted to come here.
Chloe, you can just ask me.
you must know that.
cause if she didn't,
lowest it's been in years.
I waited a long time
well, don't look at me.
kicking and screaming.
well, I guess I'll just have to
look, I'm glad
I mean, wasn't there a time
how awesome is that?
I wouldn't ask, Lois, - Have fun. - You too.
Hello?
Yeah, well, I never should have
well, that's f-fine.
wait a minute.
he is used to baling hay,
this inn is so far off the beaten path
anything.
and I already ate the Granola bar
I learned a long time ago
you weren't.
it's not much farther.
and a dead body in your yard.
that's great.
Chloe.
there it is.
what ... wait a minute.
no. No, no, just, uh ...
it's you.
I'm going for a walk.
we need to meet.
Chloe?
save any orphans recently,
what did it look like?
at least Lois didn't drive home.
if I don't find Lois, that even the society pages
you two should hang out.
silver Banshee's next victim.
I thought it only fitting
we're definitely being roasted,
I think I'm up to the challenge,
according to legend,
Yeah, seems pretty good.
see how that works.
on my way.
why, thank you.
no, of course you didn't.
I don't want to see her get hurt.
how about Bevan's diary?
get used to sharing you with the world.
whoa, whoa, whoa, Lois, no, no, no.
legend tells of a portal
did you know they were dating?
look at that. I got it.
well, you obviously aren't now.
I don't like where this is going.
We're...having fun.
we should sit with them.
or a painting.
I survived a tent in Guadalajara.
it's not the shower I want.
great.
okay, enough about that.
just pretend I'm not here.
I can't remember blacking out,
sorry about that. Uh, we're late.
I don't know about that.
but after everything Chloe's been through,
people collect them.
I'm hanging up now.
I don't remember.
she took a walk a while ago.
but ultimately,
how about you? Anything new?
of everything.
you know who I am.
Bevan feared that he would soon be
why, you want to share another bottle?
look, I know it's not my place to say anything, but ...
what if it's important?
well, it's, uh...
a relic in her image?
you do?
what about your loss?
don't worry.
correct me if I'm wrong...
I did stop a bank robbery.
Lois, I think they came here for brunch.
both of which are complicated.
that's good.
just kidding. Oh.
now we have a mugging on Halpert.
sealing the portal shut.
Clark, I don't care how bad it is.
and I wish I could forget waking up.
Chloe.
tell me a story, daddy.
it's kind of Scottish, unless your war was won.
and I almost killed you, Clark.
welcome to the Mcdougal Inn.
kind of like we did.
because the only inn they're gonna be staying at
a better world.
the Silver Banshee.
you lead the way.
Thanks.
Chloe, what possessed you we need to find it before it kills again.
where are my clothes? - I don't know.
tell me you found something.
well, I hope she left a trail of bread crumbs
then what are you?
to see the world's largest ball of yarn.
we might never find our way out of here.
that you have found someone that makes you happy,
and will never trust you.
just as I was denied power.
this will be the last vacation I take with anyone.
what brochure?
but after several deaths in the village,
I wasn't the only one out here.
we are partners, after all.
bad day for that guy.
now, the real question is ...
okay.
maybe it was one of them.
it's not real.
sorry.
okay.
it could have been worse.
from now on, I won't.
we could pretend not to see them.
I must say, I think your taste in wine
that made the whole trip worthwhile.
tonight is about the two of us.
done.
by waiting for her to come to you.
maybe I can fix the pipe.
you tell me.
but he stands apart.
wrapped up that Pandora's box to begin with.
or we can give them some space.
but missing dinner is a definite bust.
but I got to be honest with you ...
which I think is perfect.
Oh, right. Yeah, okay.
a little privacy, please?
Lois.
when you would have given just about anything
or "I feel very strongly about you,
I tried to call, but the line wouldn't connect.
how about countryside bed-and-breakfast?
and since we have no common ground,
this is our last couples vacation together.
and then I fell asleep, but I promise ...
throw out the white flag. It's Lois.
that was a long time ago, is almost as good as your taste in women.
I should really just cut my losses and ...
you mean ex-bachelor.
then you'll get a surprise.
there are wolves in the forest.
I mean, I didn't even know they were dating.
if we hadn't driven 40 miles out of our way but we're not all cut out for coupledom.
good choice.
you're jealous.
some of those little decorative soaps.
to stare at that farmer's tan in all its glory, I'm guessing?
the reservation's under Kent.
you know what we could do?
There...isn't one.
the room you reserved sprang a leak.
don't let the bedbugs bite.
I don't know when. - Lois, we wouldn't be late
Oh, god.
good point.
you took Lois on a romantic getaway
I'm all about the girl power, really, he's never gonna be that person.
Bevan didn't just use blood where she was given great powers.
you will never win a woman's heart
quiet weekend at home, huh?
you were out here, Chloe. Do you think you could have ...
so, just lay it on me.
you were? Okay.
it's Clark's loss.
that you discovered your powers.
I don't remember you telling me
what was the last thing you do remember?
then don't say anything.
when she scraped it.
Yeah, but one of her strengths
I had to cover all my bases.
to the Chloe Sullivan charity case,
no.
well, I found the brochure for the inn at the apartment.
it was a little less fate, actually.
soggy room.
articles are in, phone calls have been returned,
Yeah. That's nice. That's fun stuff.
now we're even.
I can handle a...
was it Hansel and Gretel, do you suppose?
this is the lantern I brought from the inn.
they're always there.
I know it's called a bed-and-breakfast,
it's just a gift.
I need your help.
I'll find out who Siobhan inhabited next.
to some sort of a bed-and-breakfast.
but you weren't
Yes, can I help you?
and as good a friend as Clark is,
that with Ollie's less-than-perfect track record,
I think Metropolis can handle one weekend without the blur.
you've got a confused coed in your living room
you, uh...
Yeah, well, um, why don't you answer it, Lois?
and some aren't.
before you book us up for the next two months,
did you see the latest crime rating?
what?
your instincts are remarkable.
I must have been possessed.
that's been at the bottom of my bag since...
at least, I'm trying not to see that.
I can see why you left that out of the brochure.
and I am officially ready for our magical mystery weekend.
the next time you want to take a shower with someone,
Hello, Lois.
um, after Siobhan was killed,
now there's just scars.
he used it to paint his own portrait over hers.
uh, listen, I-I'm looking for Chloe.
Chloe?
maybe we should just say that next time - More fame. - I like fame.
okay, the last time I checked,
let's just say that I'm in control ...
how was I supposed to know that Oliver was ...
I heard Bart's in town.
Oliver and I were having a talk,
she makes Susan b. Anthony look like a quitter.
Oliver, I wanted to keep things simple, you know,
if you ask me, great-great-great-uncle Bevan that better not have my name on it.
unless Christmas came early this year, - Chloe ... - You do that.
you're perfect.
Oh, I apologize, but thanks to the storm,
Really?
I seem to recall you having some kind of a concern
for future reference and, you know,
cause that would be totally fine. I ...
10 minutes.
you got to use context clues.
so is your ability to heal.
and second-guessed myself or us.
I think fate has brought us together.
he's one of you.
Lois.
just give me 10 minutes.
Siobhan felt so robbed of her life on earth old ladies, maybe, anything like that?
you'll thank me later.
I-I thought about getting you, uh,
thank you.
okay, look, Lois, I know what you're gonna say ...
but it does make me feel better.
but I'll have my cell, so if anything comes up ...
okay, cowboy,
there's another portrait painted under this one.
and with ollie, I don't have to worry about that, okay?
turns out the leak wasn't as bad as she said it was.
it's nothing to worry about, everyone.
and just around the corner, there's a ...
like a statue or an engraving?
make it a queen.
how did you find out?
but I'm still a Mcdougal.
so let's escape before Randall sends you on an assignment.
what's going on?!
but if that spirit is responsible for this murder,
before I realized the pipe had burst,
or maybe we could just go for a moonlit walk in the woods.
then I'm handing the reins over to John Jones.
you'd think they'd be a little more progressive than that.
if you're referring to Clark,
that means you guys are having a little fun. It's cute.
you ... you didn't really need either one of them, did you?
you may have met your match,
cell reception is horrible around here.
to paint over his sister's image.
has helped me to manage my powers better.
now, we need to hear the rest of Siobhan's story.
too much?
and I know your story.
Really? Well, it couldn't have been that bad, right?
whether you want to admit it or not, major,
okay, well, um,
Clark, it's one weekend. Enjoy it.
I may not have believed all the ghost stories,
no, I just thought that you ...
I don't think that Oliver would appreciate it.
look, I know that I ran a verbal marathon last night strictly for environmental purposes ...
little jellies.
there's no way you'd run off to Cyprus
I wouldn't want you to be.
I gave the last room away.
Yeah, I can see that.
unless something made you drop it.
but I'm sure he's just bailing buckets to stay afloat.
not toasted over a bottle of McDougal's finest tonight.
thank you for the not-so-subtle contribution
okay.
your experiment would have killed me.
um, it's ... it's a spoon.
it doesn't mean they haven't healed.
Hey, guys, come here.
who told Chloe to go walk in the woods, anyway?
I promise.
Thanks.
with the help of a certain lovely reporter,
in case you haven't noticed, Zod,
sweet dreams.
you know, she's stronger than you think she is, though, so...
you got any bagpipes to go with that outfit there, lassie?
definitely not calm.
wow, that was fast, even for you.
but do you still have secrets?
some place called the Mcdougal Inn.
I have your room all ready, Mrs. Green,
my training with Jor-El
just ... just let it go to voicemail.
by using labels and definitions.
I waited for you to get ready for three hours.
can the blur handle two nights with Lois?
and I waited for years for him to see that,
I just want you to be comfortable.
like, in a Smallville far, far away.
I don't see you breaking through any glass ceilings so the shower is yours.
that wasn't Lois' brochure, Clark.
Oh, my god.
how can you be so "eh" about this?
okay.
not your usual goal-oriented self.
because, you know, they obviously don't need it?
I must have dropped it here.
you were shot a few weeks ago, but I just checked,
they certainly come in useful,
okay.
okay.
there are few that could stop you.
there's always some unspoken part, like "I'm sorry
the underworld was still underground.
that's the point.
um, you know, I'm done here,
well, for a country that prides itself on men wearing skirts, couldn't find star city's most eligible bachelor here.
maybe not.
I mean, okay, yeah,
and we're not complicating things
I just feel safer knowing he's around.
um, if you'd like to try,
now, I may be able to fly,
Clark said something, didn't he?
I'll get the information you need.
we banished her soul with blood and flame,
Ah, perfect timing.
no matter what it takes, I'll do it.
I mean, I'm more partial to sporks, myself,
uh, Mr. and Mrs. Green didn't quite finish unpacking
and yours.
I was possessed by a 300-year-old Scottish banshee,
and with you, we're no comment.
he's going to patrol while I'm out on the town with Lois.
in every relationship, to deserve getting his face scratched off?
Oh, I will be.
you talk like we're on different sides.
trust me. We had no idea the two of you would be here.
but we did get to see the world's largest ball of yarn.
so, what did he do
and while I doubt that the whole breakfast part poses any problems...
I was just with her, actually.
Yeah, and the best part is now we can double-date.
you're a soldier dedicated to his cause.
I just completely blanked out.
strong...
I think it's great that you and Oliver are together.
but you'll never tell me.
wait, wait, hol... wait, where are you going?
since she was betrayed by a man,
especially when it comes to keeping an ear and an eye out to savor the power of my Kryptonian birthright, is giving people what they need and sacrificing what she wants.
twist.
some risks are worth taking.
I need you to get information on Tess Mercer.
okay, so, not that I haven't seen enough to see...me.
I can't do that.
well, hello to you, too.
it's my cellphone.
when you decided to throw me a surprise party in the shower.
her soul was sent to the underworld,
and then you passed out, only to come to with no memory.
Lois, for our first weekend away together,
and then Lois must have accidentally opened the portal
how did you guys manage to find the road less traveled?
you don't remember seeing...
Oh, god.
forever's a long time.
if it weren't a matter of life or death.
Chloe, you need to figure out how to close that portal.
but you won't.
look, Chloe, there's food.
try to explain it over breakfast maybe next century.
obsession can cost you more.
Oh, uh, why? Is this your side usually?
we'll go to Cyprus, rule the world,
she hasn't returned, and I'm getting a little worried about her.
but now I shall have both.
Clark, I just ...
Lois, they obviously came out here to escape from everything,
so...
not to assume what belongs to who in that apartment.
you won't take advice about relationships from Clark Kent.
I-I did love Clark... a lot.
what the hell was that?
she wanted to return from the underworld and live again.
through which her spirit could return to this world.
promise me you won't.
you have one in particular that I'm partial ...
was I ... did you see ...
I don't suppose you read Gaelic?
uncommon strength
okay.
I got it.
but killing men won't make up for what was done to you.
we've seen weirder things.
just don't take her for granted.
black, white, and weird all over.
and I will do anything it takes to protect it.
I bought you a spoon, one of those little...
so he conducted an ancient Scottish ritual - All right. What about? - The blur.
no. No, no, no, it's a slippery slope.
this is Chloe and Oliver, together, here.
that's what you get for not packing light, Lois.
and I have mine.
Chloe, how much wine did you have to drink at dinner?
all thanks to my stellar sense of direction.
this is so not the weekend I had in mind.
uh...yeah,
go back to bed. Everything's okay.
is that the side of the bed that you like sleeping on?
no, god, I definitely don't remember seeing that.
not from you.
I think we should skip the old b-and-b's for awhile.
we'll, um, take any room that you have available.
Clark?
just give me the question. I'll find you an answer.
how did you weaken me in the barn?
even when he's gone, Clark rules your mind.
well, as incredible as that r-and-r attempt was,
Yeah.
I was denied vengeance,
able to spar with me on an equal footing...
but since I'm assuming you don't mean the French countryside...
this...I won't be needing.
so...
and we had no idea there was even a "you two,
I will not be forced down again.
what would you do if our positions were reversed?
when I come back, can we just hit the "reset" button
or I could say that this is one for the "win" column.
come with me.
Oh, well, maybe you've just been especially good this year.
well, you've come to the right girl.
your choice of meeting place is revealing.
well, how do you know this isn't what she wants?
almost Kryptonian.
that we meet in the home of the one person that unites us.
Oh, well, there's a ... a new compound bow I'm trying out.
Clark Kent, my hero.
I-it's the last room on the left.
you have your secrets...
but everyone you've ever let in has betrayed you...
let's, uh, hope that,
I can explain this, sort of.
I'm sure that Lois didn't have to drag you into the woods and covered the relic in Siobhan's spilled blood,
and what would happen in the beds with the non-powered people if you...
there was a ... a face, like a phantom.
how about a cup of tea while you wait for your boyfriend?
read your own newspaper, Tess.
Oh, I'll be leaving these woods.
with, like, no strings or ribbons.
of Clark Kent's private... life tonight, I ...
um, usurped his sister Siobhan's birthright,
I was wondering ... hoping that you'd call again.
Lois. Uh, what ... What room is it, exactly?
Yeah, speaking of clues, "Just because" gifts are never just because.
Lois Lane, at your service.
but Lois already made a kind donation in your name.
well, Lois...
something tells me you'll never stop surprising me, Lois.
well, since you insisted on being a man of secrets,
I want to know what gives him that power.
which is fine. Really.
one person stands while the other one kneels.
you know my secret.
look, the legend of Siobhan McDougal is just a ghost story.
and since this is where my memory hits a roadblock,
I didn't think you were, Ollie.
and I decided to go for a walk.
I mean...I am.
drink wine, swim in the sea.
let's face it, Clark ... without me, you'd still be lost.
looks like we're all clear on the western front for now.
but even with his x-ray vision, he never did.
well, I thought I would join you.
and if you were wrong...
I think we close this portal with fire.
what could have made that noise?
we're no presents, no pressure, no strings.
so, how is it that this wailing wonder has gotten topside?
took her crown and castle, and then killed her.
which is why the information you have is so valuable.
you know, speaking of Clark ...
my little experiment proves that my instincts were right.
you have a little bit of pinot right there, actually.
I'm guessing that spirit started driving this dune buggy.
but the world would willingly follow him on foot.
she was granted her wish, at a price.
maybe a guy shouldn't take someone like you for granted.
you crave a man that's your equal.
Oh, I still have goals.
how about we just take Mr. and Mrs. Pda's room
but you can't tell anyone about it.
sometimes they can be kind of cute, too, you know.
it was said to be a relic created in Siobhan's own image.
gone Norman Bates?
thanks to someone's overdeveloped protective instincts,
and I want to know what will take it away.
I can't afford to let you share it.
Oh, murder, misogyny, and mayhem.
superstitious villagers also gave her a new name...
let's talk about Mr. Green in the bedroom with my cousin.
information is also power.
what kinds of powers?
this is a relationship, Chloe, not a spelling bee.
I doubt that you've only used your powers for seduction.
we all want the same thing ...
the blur has become humanity's new messiah.
except you didn't say what size bed you'd prefer.
we burn her body and burn her blood.
but...he's not your competition.
but a girl can never have too many...spoons?
okay, Clark, we have a car-jacking over on Samson street.
she was cursed to kill men ... Any that crossed her path.
I can't tell you, Lois
but you understand that better than anyone.
well, sometimes trust comes at too high a price.
you really think a centuries-old spirit has come back for revenge?
and play our favorite indoor game again?
if it means being with you, I can wait forever.
why don't I take you to see Chloe, instead?
I think more than that I just wanted someone who would get me.
unexpected, but useful.
there's snow angel, surfer girl, city chic.
and the ability to slay any man that hears her wail.
so much for a relaxing walk to calm my nerves.
then burned her body so her spirit could not walk again.
stop!
definitely.
I came alone.
not just yours.
did you, uh...
or plant them there.
recruitment?
what protocol?
dismissed.
thanks for the blood sample. Unknown Caller
I'm sure it's fine.
did it hurt you?
don't you come near me.
I'm serious.
checkmate.
who are you?
what were you doing, John?
come on, now.
it's terrible.
well, once I sign off,
I'll tell you what.
well, this isn't about us.
using every tool I've got.
isn't that right?
they'll come after all of you.
in that department.
and you turned away.
that's good.
Hey.
who's he talking to?
Waller saw our faces,
that's very, very funny. Yeah.
Nope. No name.
all right, then.
you can't.
it's Waller's code name.
unfortunately for me,
well, better bruised than dead.
I would have b-- - Chloe.
I don't know.
you're one to talk.
it's just really hard to pull off.
whose gaze wilts small trees.
what do you think?
I mean, if you hadn't
then who was?
do you understand?
that's the basic idea.
Oliver...
she knows my identity.
no, someone else did.
well, maybe they recruit people
security breach
I did not abandon her.
you're late.
to find an earwig serial number.
Clark, I'll come with you. I can
what do you want?
you can't think John murdered this guy.
exactly.
I'm taking a chance
well, that's just the thing.
no radio, no beacon, nothing.
look, young lady, while they're on patrol.
they came after us.
so, it's back on me?
check. - Check what?!
Conuter-scan initiated
that's because someone's hidden it,
agent Mercer.
you want to fill us in on what happened?
kind of gives a whole new meaning
all for the better.
get me out of here!
I think it might be a good idea
Chloe, seems to be taking longer than normal was murdered, he warned me that,
doctor Fate's final act
he was tracking some armed men
Tess.
and we weren't winning.
what are you doing here?
fend for herself.
they're not tights.
Oh, but your timing is so good.
Yeah, well, I didn't know
no.
if he meant "Checkmate,
but I abandoned you.
your freckles...
the less you confided in me,
well, it bruised.
cause it...
who's been in here?
come in, white queen.
what do you know, John?
what more do you want?
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
what are you gonna do?
be careful.
I can get him back.
tha would be murder.
there's no sign of Jones.
at first, I thought she was crazy.
followed them under the monorail,
just because he doesn't check in
Yeah, I'd rather be shot at.
that's hard to pull off.
uncle Sam was into drugs and bondage.
whoa. Slow down, guys.
I didn't call him.
no lies.
which...
who are you working for?
they're not tights.
wait a minute -- Check...Mate?
was government-issued.
those people belong to Belle Reve.
I need a blood sample analyzed.
Oh. Congratulations.
you know, unlike some people,
did you check the local security cameras?
they look like tights.
you're the one they call Watchtower.
unless you are directly related,
so I will continue to protect and serve,
I'm sorry, Chloe.
why don't you take it up with them?
we have a lot to catch up on.
icicle.
it better not be for tax evasion.
no. That's not necessary.
I can't believe you wear tights.
but I'll keep an eye out.
it's your move.
to the "I Want You" posters, doesn't it?
it scared the life out of me.
I searched the archived security footage
I'm guessing you didn't get the evite.
barely had time to change clothes, actually.
I never told her about you.
I think that the earpiece in John's pocket
you know who I am.
who are you working for?
let her go.
the place you call the castle.
well, either that's quaintly coincidental
Clark.
or he's working for the same lovely lady
soldiers! I need your help!
did you try the power switch?
after I took over Luthorcorp,
you're gonna hurt somebody.
you didn't know he was missing?
what am I supposed to do here?
I'm gonna go awol.
well, I'm here on police business.
you saw Watchtower as Big Brother,
I'm glad you're safe, too.
Hey, Chloe, um...
green Arrow.
including Cameron Mahkent.
I will expose you to the world.
the beluga not the right temperature?
who were... special.
let me down from here!
but the truth is, with Watchtower,
you didn't abandon me, Clark.
it's not murder. It's strategy.
was to restore my Martian abilities.
that's where I saw Oliver last.
the Blur.
I'm sorry for everything.
Yeah, okay, I understand that. Okay, we've gotten that far.
trust me -- I've had it in spades.
Oliver actually follows protocol.
you want me to do, uh, handstands
we got a hit from the passport agency.
you fixed it.
I believe this is yours.
edward Lott.
back when I could trust you.
you, of all people.
Oh, no. Don't get me wrong. I love black on black.
his dying word was "Check.
I keep seeing you on the sidelines,
radio ahead.
someone's collecting them.
Absolutly. Uh, so, let's see.
protecting every citizen he can.
go civilian.
so it's you...
W-what is it that you want? You're asking me for something.
it was me.
thanks for keeping my seat warm at Watchtower.
stay out of this, Clark.
but you can't stop a bullet
come in, white queen.
well, t-they're not tights.
you might want to save the song-and-dance routine
release her now.
where is that?
these things are alien.
well, it's easier than you think.
some harpy gets on a monitor.
well, I got to tell you,
how so?
didn't you?
you better be.
of course I'm safe.
you don't have to join her.
that's why I'm recruiting capable people like you.
you know I'll come after you.
well, you know, Tess,
I never would have gone after you
names, faces, addresses.
copy in progress
and rule number three
because as much as I want to believe
well, you're welcome. Don't get used to it.
I must say, I liked your colors better
don't flatter yourself.
let's go.
he and everyone else dial in with Watchtower
well, call it what you want.
somebody get in here!
every surveillance feed is down
when our system's back up, that was taken from the cameras across the city.
for the shareholders when you try to explain to them,
last I heard, he was in the psych ward at Met Gen.
did this woman give you her name?
I was just trying to get some answers.
just -- I was just gonna say be careful out there,
it's easier than you think.
you buried an arrow into my chest, Oliver.
considering what I pay out every year,
I need people with the abilities
I've broken your confidence in me, Clark.
when I saw the future,
maybe I thought you'd be safer there.
you need to trust me, Clark.
no one. We're secured.
tell me about Checkmate.
just listen. That's when you let go.
Oliver wasn't even the real target.
that are already established in the private sector.
that's because I'm still here.
that's very, very funny.
but, like she said, eventually I have to choose sides.
you've been keeping more secrets than Lex ever had.
atms, traffic lights, convenience stores.
I'll set a new net myself.
and she's recruiting heroes for the U. S. of A.
am I clear to shoot? Over
I'm not telling you anything.
he had a hidden lock pick.
he patrols the streets of Metropolis,
it's just a question of who.
when Sylvester Pemberton from the Justice Society
well, you know, I figure it's a public place.
knowing I had a warm bed to come home to.
for you to just hang your tights for one night...
Sylvester Pemberton came to warn me about Checkmate
within an hour after this footage was taken, who came through the psych ward in Met Gen
it'll be faster if we work together.
you were able to re-engage so quickly
I'm disappointed, Tess.
just being out here with you in the open.
whatever kind of day you think you've had,
she wanted information about Lex's alien investigations.
you first.
then you betrayed me, Tess.
you know, I got to ask you a question, though.
rule number two -- think about your wardrobe choices.
he seems pretty high-profile for a secret-gent man.
I'm gonna start to think you're falling for me.
you better be careful, Ollie.
something they called "Watchtower.
one minute, I am saving someone's bacon.
well, maybe the view will change your mind.
that potential's gonna be short-lived.
you're the one who brought us together.
but after cross-referencing those last four digits, Clark, flipped that castle's electric switch when you did,
you're simply reacting out of fear.
that's something out of your mouth I can believe.
we will not take lightly.
no. I didn't tell her anything.
I know you're fast.
the moment that he was attacked by...
didn't you see my texts? I lost Oliver.
maybe you just didn't trust me.
you pushed me out of the way.
the prisoner overpowered me!
all you have to do to save her life
you shouldn't have done that, Clark.
it's been a really long day.
after being dormant so long.
this blood confirms my suspicions.
I swear...
this was taken a few hours ago.
if you know what's good for you, don't start.
and you ever...
Dr. Brenner. I was looking for you.
fear?
I don't think there's enough stationery for that, Tess.
that's the bedside manner they say has been missing.
looking for any sign of Oliver.
there's only so many weapons you can throw at me.
so that's what got you out of bed before the dinner bell.
I will let Watchtower go.
I need your help.
I'm afraid I can't discuss patient information.
there's an army of heroes growing.
when you don't know where she is.
and then it was like a massive mute button went on
you got to know when to say good night.
I think we're both a day late and a dollar short
why don't I walk you down to archives,
why not include the rest of us?
that means attending a Luthorcorp shareholder dinner,
now that Green Arrow is officially on Checkmate's radar,
you were the evaluating doctor on several patients
showing external power breach.
stand ready for immediate orders.
but, you know, I kind of liked being out in the field,
looks like you got benched.
John Jones?
things aren't always black and white.
it's time for a new game.
that was right after I confronted him.
Tess, I need some answers.
to do what?
rule number one -- you don't shoot your date.
fear is what prompts us to protect ourselves.
maybe your loyalties lie with someone else.
why would the government take Green Arrow?
and when it comes to choosing sides...
your identity's safe -- for now.
and we'll see if we can't clear this up?
you sure are nice to look at.
and it's foreshadowing a threat
we're 20 minutes to the airfield.
you know the rules.
but I fear for our country's security.
you could use some conflict resolution.
I'm sure you were.
after you signed off on their transfer,
but then Lex's files changed your mind.
belle Reve was never even notified that they were coming.
you know, Oliver...
just that her organization was called Checkmate.
I'm not being unreasonable.
black on black.
I don't remember signing up for any chess club.
and she's not gonna stop coming after us.
is give one simple address.
you're not gonna be happy where he was planted next.
if you wanted a rematch, all you had to do was ask.
a month after I started working at Luthorcorp,
um, none of them actually made it to Belle Reve
you're the one who saw our potential.
I think you've got the wrong Green Arrow.
next thing I know, I'm the only pig on a pork-chop express.
to end the war quickly and decisively.
it feels more like kidnapping than a booth at a job fair.
the last few years.
an oath I want to break.
tell me you caught them.
it's time for you to pick a side.
they're not tights.
please.
because you helped solve a problem that you created?
when they were more... Patriotic.
who bridges all the sides together.
the correct answer is
at least we have that.
none of this should have happened.
they came after us, and they'll come after you.
I didn't think you were gonna show.
did it hurt to do something moral for once, Tess?
did you properly secure the detainee?
what the hell do you want? Round 2?
but I see your point. Yeah. Hmm.
the best thing I ever did in this be was kick you out of it.
or whoever did this finished what they started.
these are the same people who took down the JSA.
it's smart... Probably.
I can tell.
I'm sorry.
well, your buddy system works.
we've been blocked by a new player.
unless you've already found something.
uh, the sketchy deal with China.
she starts telling me this is the welcome wagon
well, I'm sorry you think these tactics are crude.
and that explains why John Jones was covering for them.
excuse me. Those are my charts.
I wouldn't believe your dying breath.
you're right in the middle of the game.
what, are you crazy, Tess? This isn't a cartoon.
you're after everyone who's ever worked at Watchtower.
please follow me this way to the dining room.
that I've stopped that day from happening, it still might.
but you're not in this alone.
you will be the ambassador
or you're out.
you think I didn't know the second we lost him?
but I wanted you and the rest of them
he made me tell him where Checkmate's headquarters are
tell me the location of Checkmate's Headquarters
if I had known that you were the Green Arrow.
you forget that we need to watch each other's backs, too.
I'm afraid you've made a critical error.
I can't wait to see the defeat on their faces.
boy, am I glad to see your friendly face.
I saw she knew a lot more than I did.
I have reason to believe there are aliens among us.
parading around in tacky green leather.
Clark, you spend so much time watching everybody else's back,
I would have told the team what was going on.
I don't have time for polite requsts.
the less you have to depend on me.
Oliver, I need your help.
I was approached by the white queen.
I am fully committed to Checkmate.
I'm gonna go underground.
support onsite.
it's like someone threw a big blanket over the whole area.
green Arrow may not have been the endgame,
I'm sorry. Perhaps I was a bit abrasive.
he was here on patrol when Watchtower lost contact.
there's Checkmate agents everywhere, so...
he's the C. E.O. of a consumer manufacturing company.
do you want to move forward with our operation?
makes it hard to protect and serve, doesn't it?
Oh, my God. You're safe.
but there's only one way to leave Checkmate.
don't be so naive.
Oliver, Clark's in trouble.
welcome to the suicide squad.
but it's time you elevated your service to your country.
kidnapping is illegal -- even for the government.
but he was our opening move.
when I joined Checkmate, I took an oath.
forgive me, Oliver.
even if I gave you Watchtower's database,
but I swear -- I never told her the Kryptonians were here.
I want your loyalty to Checkmate.
you left your greatest asset vulnerable.
you don't have clearance to peek under the hood.
chase down rumors and U. F.O. Stories?
I was just making sure that our acquisition was still secure.
Where's the rest of your team?
you have a long plane ride coming to think it over.
a police Detective who won't go near fire.
after he found out they captured something called "Watchtower.
they have designs much bigger than just getting green cards.
Zod and his people had already started World War III, and your big dreams of changing the world.
the only way you'd get me back in here is by force.
and the time has come for you to do your patriotic duty.
stand down, Agent Mercer.
actually... It was a taser.
you are a guest of the U. S. government.
no alarms have been reported yet.
I want the report of Agent Mercer's last physical.
what happened? The jet late leaving Paris?
if you step forward, out of the shadows,
and we both know there is only one way out.
thank you for coming, Detective Jones.
let's just say that...
what if I have proof -- actual alien blood?
maybe these aliens aren't here to start a war.
she's not wrong, you know -- Waller.
you are here for something far greater, Clark.
that doesn't belong to you.
he was on the list of Metropolis General morgue.
she was right about being prepared.
I was hoping I would get the chance to enlist you.
there are moments when I wish I could go back
if you don't stand with us, you stand against us.
maybe this will help your indecisiveness.
that's worth something, isn't it?
our little lady here is a Checkmate Agent.
I didn't give you enough credit.
who knows how many deals were sealed right here?
you came for what's in there, didn't you?
that blood traveled light-years to get here.
those Santorini sunsets...
we won't be renewing the operation.
for everything I've done that's destroyed your trust.
someone who will not hesitate to expose your double life.
something you could have used more of before coming here.
the keystone to World War III?
but I like to have my cake and eat it, too.
anything happens to me, and bye-bye, blondie.
there are more players on the board than you think.
if you don't leave immediately, I will call security.
the Black Canary, Impulse, Aquaman, Cyborg.
you skipped... A few ceck-ins...
but I have the feeling somebody already has
clearly, you are rusty.
the location of Watchtower's central database.
what is it you want? What do you want?
but he -- he lets the most valuable ally somebody with a very high level of intel.
green Arrow, welcome to Checkmate.
I told you how to shut down the castle's power grid.
Lois!
No!
you and Clark are a regular
I wish I could give you more,
Zod.
okay.
with parking on P1.
you're looking for.
with your ball and chain.
Oh, my God.
we just have to start now.
mom!
it finally sunk in.
in the '90s.
even for a weekend,
listen, Mr. White,
Clark, I...
was blown to bits.
to top it off,
we're having so much fun
red Queen?
with your life?
I was saving the world.
what did I do?
bad news, Clark.
in a jogging suit.
I have found a story
don't worry.
in your relationship.
Perry!
sorry, kid.
I'm sorry.
but they're not.
you have got to forward this
big players.
club soda.
here. Let me help you. - Yeah.
Yeah, well, despite her handle,
I've got you.
then we need to find it.
any sign of Tess Mercer?
really great stuff.
he burned you.
you've raised the dead.
I need your help.
Chloe, the book of RAU isn't here.
nice try.
Oh, right. Taco Dan's?
thanks for dinner.
to share your life with.
I've seen this before.
I know you just came across that footage,
Thanks, honey.
no, no. It's always like this.
a break from this relationship.
it sounded right up your alley.
you had me hauled in here to help your people.
is everything okay?
I don't know what the hell he wants.
save our unemployed derrieres, a few months ago.
we were fired.
so if there's any mention
it's no big deal.
what a surprise.
Yeah, well...
that will get us corner offices at the Planet,
Chloe.
what about the book of RAU?
well, it's all my fault.
the Perry White?
that I can't ignore.
maybe we should take a break.
don't talk like that.
sounds like "Survivor: Smallville.
I was blocked by an operative
thanks for all your help, Perry.
you were right.
I've got to hand it to you, Mrs. K.
your move.
look, I appreciate the offer, Lois,
you didn't stay.
of the book of RAU anywhere in this
the last thing I wanted to do
you can imagine how I felt
I'm doing on the side...
to help with the heavy lifting.
and the world needs you.
look, Lane...
or shootouts, at the dry cleaner's.
or I missed a hell of a party.
I'm looking at it now, Clark.
who's sorry now, biotch?
my phone just got turned off this friend.
it's my destiny.
you know, Clark, this could explain
is that your next big story?
please don't kill him.
why didn't you tell me?
I mean, maybe Zod and the Kandorians living out of a carry-on bag,
what's the holdup?
then what are you thinking about?
but we always work it out.
now, I think she's shadowing let alone an image-enhancement program.
I don't want to take a break.
well, either you've been robbed,
me, I put the "t" in "takeout.
I'll be back soon.
Yeah.
it's kind of like being on a chain gang was ruin your weekend with Perry.
Lois.
I still believe in us.
Really?
it's okay, mom.
protect me.
Clark, if this is Tess gone rogue, and half my wardrobe is being held hostage and it's just not a side
Jor-El put it in the north wall.
the truth is...
experienced partner.
running Senate subcommittees by day,
Lois, you're under a lot of stress right now.
I got to go.
too bad, Ahab...
but there's got to be something more on it.
chasing every story that moved.
where is the book of RAU?
don't do this.
excuse me.
I want to believe in us, too.
Clark...
but there's a lot I have to figure out, isn't a break.
he said something about someone named the Red Queen
like I was...
yea. I'm gonna be great.
you killed my sister.
I don't have Clark right now
he has nothing to do with this!
um, could you two help me with the...
I thought all you spy guys went to Yale.
when I tried to investigate,
it's never been better.
you remember Perry White?
well, it hasn't been easy.
what are you doing here?
Oh, I can't believe you're doing this to me, Red.
it's just -- it's so complicated.
are you okay, mom?
I made a surprise picnic, - Did I do that? - Yeah.
where is the book of RAU?
don't be.
Clark, I found that footage of Jor-El
taco Dan's. What can I get you?
vala!
there's some big meet and greet going down, to my high-school journalism teacher.
come on, Perry!
we're just enjoying taking it slowly now.
because you knew in your heart
if you're not careful,
you put the "m" in "modern woman.
and we aren't taking it slow.
but thanks to Tess' little break-in,
damn it!
following Jonathan to a small town
it didn't work.
we make a good team, kid.
how are you and Clark?
did this guy tell you what he wants?
I'm not.
Thanks.
don't turn around.
Tess Mercer.
I know. I just -- I've been distracted.
that's what I tried last time.
Kent Farm
talk about a recipe for disaster.
experience is overrated.
why our favorite alien nation has gone awol.
I'm working from home.
you're predictable.
we're actually taking a break.
you know us -- chocolate and peanut butter, and I can't keep lying to everyone about us.
it's a breakup.
I found the mother lode.
I need a purpose...
Perry!
you've got to be kidding me.
two ex-wives and an ex-dog later,
that was my dad's jacket.
Oh, my God. Perry...
he's cast a wide net.
that your boss was Amanda Waller...
who's up for a crackling fire?
what do you want from me?
see you, chief.
I don't want to get in the middle of anything.
it's as if you're expecting me to single-handedly
it's the Kandorian bible.
Clark, when you disappeared from my life,
I guess we were all pretending
I'll be there as soon as I can.
our pal the Red Queen.
I was trying to protect you.
I'm flying out tomorrow.
and I haven't really had much time to
Yeah.
until that rainy day.
I'm sorry. I thought you were a, u -- - Thief?
Lois?
and a gold disk, a bunch of aliens.
except when we don't.
then let me go.
where I didn't fit in.
Clark!
I thought you'd be at the Planet.
I understand that, but maybe you're just overreacting.
under "big, bad Nemesis.
I've been tracking this one for months.
Lois and I got our signals crossed.
even the FBI doesn't know about
Oh, Clark...
what a spread.
but I can't drop everything right now.
but our unemployment situation has just gone to Defcon 1.
to another plane of existence.
yin and Yang, Tarzan and Jane.
you say you're saving the Planet, and slide it back to me.
I've had my hands full with the Kandorians.
I retracted into Watchtower.
well, excuse me for getting between a man and his tractor,
what did you do to this place?!
we used to work together.
you figured out Maxwell's charade
Clark!
I'm sorry...
hope this gets us to the Red Queen.
the truth is, Clark...
so I pulled on work boots
the book of RAU -- where is it?
maybe she's taken over Checkmate's network.
I think about him every day.
I started having problems with the Kandorians, and I...
that the best you can come up with?
my life falling apart?
right when we got fired from the Daily Planet, ... and that that little chateau of yours in the Rocky Mountains
sorry I can't share any details.
still chasing down stories, I see.
lady, you have the wrong number.
Oliver. Are you okay?
okay, we have to get out of here.
the Red Queen isn't actually a figure on Checkmate's board.
who's hosting?
I spent the first 20 years of my career a guy who needed my help.
you're the Red Queen.
I just...
I'm just glad you're here now.
I just put in a good word with your boss, Stern.
was blown to bits,
it's gonna cause quite a splash.
Lois, hi. You'll stay for dinner, I hope.
I'm your mom and nobody else.
it's not pretty, but it has to be said.
so you could get information about this RAU thing.
well, you don't hear that very often.
Clark, I'm picking up a lot of high-level chatter.
probably by aliens after the book of RAU,
you kept me in the house for dinner
mom, what is it?
all right, you lovebirds.
I'd like your blessing.
I'll let you in on a little secret
Oh, I'm not giving up on her yet.
I'm, uh, sort of held hostage here
so, tell me all the news.
it looks like we're both 0 for 2 tonight.
Lois, it's not a matter of life and death.
and you've bee doing what, exactly?
you don't understand.
a secret organization called Checkmate, things were better than they were.
and put her on the front page of the Daily Planet.
talking to her as The Blur, I...
saving the world.
I've searched the entire farm. It's not here.
cooking rocking meals by night.
no.
until after my mom's family dinner.
well, yeah. People are in such a hurry these days.
Mrs. K. I can't keep lying to you.
I got a story that's just come up, anyway.
and I don't mean on page 10.
just...
you were always the one.
how did you know I'd come here?
code name: Red Queen.
I thought we weren't gonna bring that up, dear.
even more than I do.
Chloe?
this thing is my white whale, kid.
well, I've seen you overhaul Watchtower in one night, Chloe.
mom! Everything smells great.
how's that working out for you, Lois?
actually, it is.
the four of us"?
this is a goth guy on a trampoline
come on. Sit. Join me in a drink.
we're on the brink of war, Chloe,
when will Watchtower be up and running?
I'm glad you made it home, mom.
okay, just grab the cable.
I know. I really messed things up with Lois.
you meant for me to get away.
I wanted to protect you.
and when I helped him...
that it was safe to go home again.
everything you know about the book of RAU.
didn't I read an
we ate it in here.
virtual reality bites.
I'm not sure she's gonna give you the answer
between this and the dinner disaster,
have you ever wanted to do something really important
hang on, Perry!
this isn't over, Tess.
and I just lost track of what was important.
I'm gonna ask your mother to marry me.
but I never let go of you.
I need excuse to see my own son?
Bye, Clark.
tomorrow? What about you and Mrs. K?
I really needed to get my head into a story right now.
so what do you say, kid -- Africa?
someone like your mom.
we are officially a threat.
isn't a stranger in a burning building, and the book of RAU months ago.
her reign as the Red Queen is about to end.
well, I mean, I sort of tried to tell her who I am,
but I'm gonna need the book of RAU.
but you really only care about yourself.
I hope I'm not overstepping.
then we still have to find the Red Queen.
when it's just the two of us here, then Lois and Perry are about to get buried.
watchtower can barely run a game of "Donkey Kong ,"
what matters most is having someone around
why didn't you come to me with this?
it's bigger than both of us.
which, lucky for you, I have.
I'm not this Red Queen!
if you can't recognize my butt in a pair of jeans,
I need you.
Oh, no, Austin Powers. I have your number.
I've blacked out most of that decade.
a secret government complex in the Rocky Mountains you're going to have to take the next step
Woodward and Bernstein.
that's true.
good luck reeling it in all by yourself.
ma'am, this is a Mexican restaurant.
because the Planet stopped paying my cell bill, including you.
I bumped into him at a committee hearing just couldn't stop lying to her.
does Zod have it?
in fact, the rumor has it that her name has been filed
tell me now, or I kill him.
the book of RAU.
Chloe, if that book really holds unlimited power,
you may not be saving people from train wrecks, Chloe,
when I went to Washington,
or else we'll yank her majesty off the chessboard
I think I deserve first position on the byline.
I'll -- I'll see that she gets back safe.
okay, maybe not the "pulling hair, jungle love" of it all.
Ah, those were my fuzzy-navel years.
Oh, I got a line on the Red Queen -- Nairobi.
once you knew that Perry and Lois were onto you,
I just have some responsibilities
bogey, 12: 00 high.
it's time for us to finally meet. The Blur.
and neither will Clark.
you don't seem to need that.
Oh. Well, if it's as huge as you say it is,
Yeah, well, lucky for us my mini-watchtower-that-could
sometimes the hardest save to make
you want a break?
well, here's something I can't ignore.
one of those lives is full of sacrifice,
to what?
you had to throw them off the trail.
it will destroy our life on Earth.
the book of RAU.
I'm a teetotaler... And an utter bore.
Chloe, what you've created here...
I told myself the world needs Clark Kent
I wondered if I'd made a huge mistake
looks like we've got an audience with the Queen.
that Oliver's declaration of love was a lie.
goodbye, Lane. You're the real deal.
which is fighting some kind of terrorist invasion.
Oh, this is just a little freelance project
my parties are never that good.
so I became the Red Queen.
maybe that really was a Mexican restaurant.
I guess more like big sister.
you know, he makes me laugh.
an engagement announcement in the Daily Planet?
you just had to go that one step too far.
I love you.
I'm so proud of everything you're doing
you got to give some to get some.
and we started throwing sandbags.
I know that you work for a covert organization but you don't know the first thing about me.
uh, you know, sometimes our job gets in the way,
wait a minute.
with my help, you won't be wearing any...
we both need to face that fact, Clark.
right.
but you are just as much of a hero as the rest of us.
check it out, Mrs. Kreitzman -- me and Perry White.
is the same as having all the answers.
this whole thing's an act, right? - What?
so you dragged Perry White along instead?
I need to do it on my own.
cause I've got something pretty big on the line, too.
I just wanted things to be the way they used to be.
Clark and I aren't working together at the Daily Planet.
and get us some face time with the Red Queen right now!
we know you have the book of RAU.
so your people could track down the book of RAU.
I need to find a way to make a difference with my life.
I didn't know what my purpose really was
if you care about me...
well, I can't exactly call the geek squad, Clark.
Perry, just hang on, okay?
maybe you need to be honest with her.
you'll never lose me. I'll always be here for you.
it seemed easier then.
sorry that I sent your mind reader packing.
I'm sorry I wasn't more honest with you, mom.
you know, I got tangled in my own little worldwide Web,
I've got plenty for the four of us.
I think I could get used to this.
it's just...
which is why you better stop with this guac-and-chips act
it's easy to think that having all the information
it'll go on to serve future generations.
Martha's one story I'm not sharing with anyone.
this is your lucky day, kid.
Chloe, that sounds like Checkmate.
maybe next time you can ease up on the Kryptonite.
Clark, if you want her back,
you don't really believe that, do you?
if for some reason I don't make it and you do
you really outdid yourself, honey.
I don't know why you need all these clothes.
about Perry -- I hope you don't mind.
well, I will never forget this.
it's the person closest to you.
I couldn't face the memories.
I know this phone is a DRK line to Checkmate. So, here is my order.
that's a big job for a simple reporter.
Lois, just give me a break.
I have been pounding back double-double espressos,
you know what this means, don't you?
just trying to keep us on some kind of a masthead, or even the Blur to make that happen for me.
I just want you to know that even when I hurt you,
and now that I have Ollie, I...
she showed up around the same time Waller disappeared.
I've seen a different side of her.
I needed to find the hero inside myself.
so I'm glad to see the other one has Lois in it.
Clark, here's the thing.
this Red Queen -- do you know who she is?
that is exactly how I felt when I was talking to...
it's you. You're the Red Queen.
watchtower's ready to go.
because I didn't want you in the line of fire.
red Queen. Nothing on the side, just her.
is actually pulling off a monster-wide Web search.
I'm not the hero here.
Clark, what on earth are you talking about?
since that little wake-up call of yours years ago,
I went from a city socialite headed for law school
it looks like I just got a Red Queen virtual smackdown.
I had to let go of this place for a while, Clark,
there are aliens here on our planet.
I had no idea he was on the trail.
Wow. They really did a number on your closet.
by the way, I've, uh, read some of your stuff.
anyway, I'm not the person you should be worried about.
you know, everything is pinching.
but in the end...
it was such an exciting time in my life.
the Red Queen, I presume.
and as I became Big Brother, I
all right, Lane. Here's what I've got.
I-I think it's nice to be a little old-fashioned.
but his truck broke down. So...
I want to plug in to the real world.
Perry mentioned you are writing together.
slowly set the disk on the floor
more than ever, I'm living two lives.
last thing I need is a Mrs. Kreitzman on my ass.
while you were being Krypto-knighted by our mystery majesty, and discovered the river was rising.
some kind of bigger mission in life.
dedicated to defending the planet from an alien invasion,
but I couldn't do it as Martha Kent.
that may be the answer we need.
you get to write a story with Perry White.
no, it's the real thing. I got a call from a...
Tess Mercer was being treated for cracked ribs at Met Gen.
when I was offered a job interning for a federal judge.
I-I thought I was ready, but maybe it's still too soon.
when the sun rose...
you have single-handedly brought my flatlined career back to life.
it was like I had a higher purpose.
and they are looking for this.
I got to tell 20 families are trying to track down the Holy RAU grail before we do.
she's decided to share with Clark Kent.
but someone called the Red Queen keeps blocking all of his moves.
with Lois, actually.
the city girl saves the day.
we just got the coordinates to meet the Red Queen.
after one day in the trenches with Perry White,
I owed him one from a long time ago.
Lois, we need to talk.
I realized I don't have to go anywhere to find my higher calling.
great Caesar's Ghost.
but this puppy sells itself.
all Kryptonians will be exiled from Earth...
the book of RAU can be used to transport the Kandorians
Vala thinks the Red Queen is Tess' new handle.
it's hard coming back to this place.
Yeah, I don't know how that "I do" slipped out.
looks like she's traded up for a more...
I wish you could come back and visit more often.
I'm not a fan of his tactics, but he got the job done.
listen, Clark, the Kandorians are still M. I.A.
I just jumped at the chance.
we aren't really writing together at the moment.
and went down to the River with Jonathan.
tell us what it's like working together and dating.
and the top of the guest list is Lois lane and Perry White.
the book of RAU.
otherwise, you'll have to let her go.
and it's made me fall deeper, and...
I can't believe you have to go back to being Senator Kent today.
Clark, Perry didn't leave because of you.
and I realize now that I can't look to you or...
I am not asking again.
and it has all the knowledge and power of RAU.
your father and I had our first date in this barn.
but I can't afford that luxury right now.
that's what you and dad raised me for.
there was this one story she wanted my help on, but I...
it is gonna kick your story back to Arts & Leisure.
but she thought it was more important I protect my identity.
I came home on a rainy weekend
as long as he doesn't start looking for a story.
and stay away from Clark Kent.
well, the Senate broke early for recess, and...
it wasn't easy for me to leave Clark and go to Washington.
you know, as much as I hate you for it...
I sleep better knowing you have someone special in your life.
Oh, and, uh, tell Clark we're even.
if the book of RAU is used to send the Kandorians away,
I just needed to look inside myself.
to being a farmer's wife, marooned on an island of corn.
the big break most people only dream about.
you may be really good at staying one step ahead of Checkmate,
so, is this what it was like when you busted the Star City strangler?
it was left here by Jor-El for me to save this planet.
you try any more head games, and my torture won't be virtual.
he makes me feel like everything's gonna be okay.
and whe I started investigating this shady redhead,
you know, after the glow of my wedding wore off,
but I can't be the eye in the sky anymore, Clark.
and it's all somehow connected with this.
the Senator thing kind of says it all.
so maybe what we need right now...
but the truth is, I was so afraid of losing you.
I found there were forces working against you.
but now, what you're up against...
you'll end up on the wrong side of the coming apocalypse.
maybe our two stories are really the same story.
but a part of me really needed to take that next step.
you know, you had me going until you made Oliver confess .
I've seen it.
no pulse.
how'd you get them?
watchtower's right.
it's just a gift.
I can't believe it!
Clark would forget his head
charge to 250.
wait a minute.
I still don't understand
anything.
I got to go!
and keep on tunneling.
if you don't mind.
after you die,
yes?
you know, you got to admit, and I was right.
I'll be in touch.
until he's with us.
with us by your side,
not to fear, White
I can't.
Tess...
do you believe in fate, Lois?
I finished tracing our rogue Blur.
if a war breaks out,
if you choose to stay, love mom
wait!
on a planet that is desolate.
no response.
cart!
no, Ollie, no!
it's only a matter of time
unlike The Blur,
still don't have a pulse.
access to the main grid
it has been my honor
it was created by Jor-El before the U. N. gets involved.
that is a lie!
well, there's something else.
I love you!
what I've learned is that for you right now.
take a breath, Chloe.
no strings, no ribbons.
I need your help.
I've seen the future.
how do we know these people not from the shadows.
I agree with Hawkman.
I know I did.
I'm sorry.
and Clark's at the deli.
who knows what he will do?
if you remember, you don't have to do this alone.
there's got to be another way.
even when we work together.
you'll have to work together
Clark
as one.
then let's move on to plan "A."
you jumped out of your seat,
at what cost?
how long we gonna wait, Martian
uh, over and out.
I'm here...
I love you!
including Clark.
sure, next week, do you think
I think we have a little bit more time
you knew the blue Kryptonite
so the least you can do in which you love so much?
it's never too late.
Yeah.
Hey. Everyone's mobilizing.
I tracked...
before Zod commands his soldiers aren't half a galaxy away already?
it was Zod.
Zod.
all our Queen Industry sources
we wait, and the Kandorians win.
how would you know?
you think I want you to go?
to bring the world to its knees.
I can't reach anybody.
if it wasn't attached with a necktie.
it's too late.
including you.
I'm sorry.
it's always like this!
you threw your arms around me,
I mean, I've been with you
have you taken a look around you?!
I know how to treat a girl on date night.
I've been talking to the Blur.
where is it?
wouldn't that hurt her more?
he's definitely not gonna be happy
I don't want to see them die
I...
clear!
kryptonite weapons?
knew about the Book of Rau.
the Book of Rau isn't here.
and you can't stop me.
we're no match for the Kandorians, with the fact that they can fly.
Chloe!
Clark.
okay.
has just been a preparation
I should've known better
I'm heading back to Watchtower.
any new activity?
I flew.
hurry up. We're losing her.
Zod doesn't want to play Thunderdome
Lois?
just who the hell are you?
funny. Me too.
for you.
once it's activated,
you...
I've been around long enough
I have a feeling that
he needs people to rule over.
Chloe, that's only gonna stall them.
all she wanted was to leave you.
I want to be in the foxhole with you.
I knew.
because Clark would never harm anyone.
to discovering who I am, and if they do,
general.
Clark, no one wants to see you
I mean...
Houston, we got a problem.
I've made my decision.
I know my destiny.
we lost all satellite communication.
Hey, the link is up!
if there's a scandal in the Pentagon,
I had Queen Industries launch an orbiter
sir, if Kal-El still holds it,
Olsen!
let me know when you've reached the "t.
what about your life here?
so we're not gonna take any sort of action
you need to think about this.
it's like they vanished into thin air.
a world they could call their own.
once the Kandorians are gone
we wait too long, they'll have the advantage.
I'll never be able to come back.
why should they believe you?
anything.
that have ended too soon.
and White has me playing dodge ball
power the Book of Rau.
Lois.
and moved it...
I've been looking all over for you.
I hid it.
Jor-El!
doctor!
charging. Clear!
blue Kryptonite.
Ollie!
well, the satellite's up and running,
you lied about having powers.
okay, mole man, just think happy thoughts
her blood pressure's dropping.
who will be here to protect us.
I say we hold off until Kal-El has a chance to
my men willingly follow me.
all right, what's your 20?
it's breathtaking.
hardly a match for my battalion.
okay, the Kandorians are Clark's people.
that said he was the Blur.
then it's up to me
Ollie, you need to get out of there now.
long enough from them to wipe us out?
there will be other threats to mankind.
I made sure of that.
Lex Luthor announces run for presidency how the Red Queen of the Kent farm
Chloe, they're not Kandorian!
I never will.
fruit basket from the Dalai Lama,
you know, that might have something to do
they're all out on the field, a
the question is... am I enough?
so you want us to play nice?
I won't let you take this one.
you said he'd use it to kill us all.
there's a whole swarm of them, and they're closing in on you fast.
Chloe, if this was a trial, is through one of the routing panels.
when you saw my fate, what did you see?
because I'm staying.
I can't.
and hid it from me.
you've hidden, too
trust me.
we're dealing with like 100 Clarks here.
what is it?
you need to see one last time.
from your blood.
just as you ordered.
let's see if you fight like one!
you've stared down the barrel of a gun before.
only proves what a coward you are.
Kal-El's comrades have been lured to your crests,
I saw the wound.
ever hurt anyone?
Jor-El!
I won't let you kill him.
how did we get here?
Clark's right.
at their core, everyone is worth saving.
we're dealing with superpowered soldiers here.
only the strong survive!
another planet where we can live in peace, to be with you.
and what about Faora?
your career is so important to you,
well, you're not in it alone. We're a team, right?
I would stay for you.
thank you.
Chloe?
I...
I aready destroyed the tower.
Dr. Fate has seen it, too.
I've been playing hide-and-seek say that our military friends believe this is just some hoax.
the Book of Rau can transport the Kandorians
Kal-El, take us home.
you say you're saving the planet,
but I had no one else to turn to.
to send the Kandorians to another world
Clark Kent the truth from them.
but even if I wanted to use it, I can't, - I don't think that's such a good idea. - Clark...
confirmation on your flight to Jordan,
call the morgue.
seeing as you love the humans so much,
I'm gonna see if I can access the building schematics
you're not welcome here.
only the kind you make happen.
all I found in Giza are mummies.
kneel before Zod.
once I lead my people to another world,
there are aliens here on our planet.
news helicopter lost power!
I just knew that you were the one
I'm someone who doesn't care whether you live or die.
Lois, I felt so lost.
or how much it seems that someone is evil,
Luthor is making a play for the oval office,
considering everything Lois and I have been through,
you got me? Hey.
translation of Kryptonian
we'll protect the world...
for you to make the ultimate sacrifice?
she's trying to be strong, you know?
I'm proud of you.
not to reach for power that's not mine.
a silver age of heroism.
you will lead this generation,
Faora was a traitor.
when the Kandorians...
and find you a less cramped return trip.
10 mil epi -- charge to 200!
are you saying it's selfish for me to try to save people?
what about your deceptions?
to send them all away.
she would've betrayed us al.
this is not a game.
the Book of Rau is not a bible.
that sounds like a good plan, but for tonight,
it will lead us to a better place
well, it was sort of a gift.
but what about the others on both sides?
how could a guy who kept a journal in High School
Perry White.
you already destroyed my first home.
would prevent you from ascending like the others!
you want war, but it doesn't have to be like this.
Lois, please...
okay, now, halfway through the second tunnel,
please say something.
there's really no way to say goodbye.
and I know mine.
are you at the satellite station yet?
we need to flush these aliens out.
I started the training Jor-El always planned for me.
you never give up, do you, Perry?
to become the team that you were meant to be.
W-what would make you stay?
is gonna help us solve our technical difficulties.
but I don't think talking me off a ledge
you are my hero.
Faora never should've trusted you.
and Zod's about to call a start to hunting season.
through every bump along this insane ride.
I just...
no sign of the Kandorians after te attack.
the one in the middle, yeah, I got it.
you know, even though Watchtower's back in the game,
you can't stop me, Zod. We're leaving this planet.
to be continued
metropolis World's Fair 2013
when your oldest friend leaves forever,
and you enslave this planet...
the Book of Rau will not destroy us!
look, I will admit that Clark's
have you learned nothing from the natural world but you only care about yourself.
I know my destiny, and it's here.
reach your true potential more than I do.
Zod's been looking for something that wields great power.
but what if every trial but I won't.
so I'm gonna need to flip a couple of switches
you have to forgive yourself.
I have something I need to tell you.
do you not have a mission to complete?
have them send somebody up to collect the body.
you know, when Tess broke into our little clubhouse here,
the humans killed the mother of my unborn child.
and the way that your eyes sparkled when you smiled,
her pupils are dilated.
and if everything that you've trained me for - Yeah. - Why didn't you tell me this before?
the last time that I saw Faora, she was with Zod.
and maybe your father disappeared on you
black Canary here. Story's the same in Athens.
it's Clark Kent.
you can't win.
I hate small spaces.
it's no surprise that Zod would lie.
only to rip it away from her?
but you're wrong about him.
it's like everyone I sent out there is a sitting duck
unlike you, I will lead from a throne,
my powers cured me.
I'm inside the air ducts right now.
Oh, no. You've got visitors.

and the Red Queen made me realize...
I knew I could count on you.
I don't know if I can dodge this speeding bullet.
you are more important.
you owe her the truth.
was for another purpose, then it was a waste,
I should go.
do not question my resolve.
dedicated to... Watchtower.
your sister was a traitor.
will kneel before Zod!
how did you get here?
I'm still coming up empty-handed on the Kandorian front.
I think all that superspeeding has crisscrossed your wires,
better to rule in hell than to serve in heaven.
and she paid for it with her life.
it's why he told you to stay away from me.
yours truly will be the one to find it.
is the guy who's always saving my butt?
all you've ever done is hide in the shadows.
because I killed my own father.
too many people will die.
I finally know who I am that I've always needed.
Jor-El did not tell you to stay here and be our guardian.
were building the Rau Tower...
just as expected, Mr. Green jeans has gone yellow.
come on.
I hid it where I confessed to you and what I'm meant to do here on earth.
I'll be thinking of you.
have you retrieved the Book of Rau?
no, that's the best way to win a bowling tournament, Tweety.
they could destroy everything I've worked for.
with this ice castle for over two years.
look, you've inspired an entire team of heroes
Yeah, the database is, uh, is important.
it's why he took away the charm I gave you.
and I needed you to know that.
do you think I wanted to kill my own child?
you don't need the fort-tress.
you're gonna have to settle for stream satellite video.
Smallville?
having others finish a fight that you started any more than I want to lose any one of you.
you had better be getting every pixel of this.
this is Stargirl online from the nation's capital.
miss Lane, seven calls from the State Department,
well, I'm -- I'm not sure I'm going.
sarcasm noted.
it sends all Kryptonians to the new world.
is coming soon to a planet near us.
you got to let her go, Clark.
to serve alongside each and everyone one of you.
and Kal-El is alone in Metropolis.
okay, uh, well, then maybe this will.
my hero told me not to trust anyone
from making another mistake like Faora.
we all know where his allegiance lies.
what exactly do you think you're saving me from?
no matter how much someone has hurt you or betrayed you because he knew you needed to make this last mile on your own.
every human, including the woman you love,
someone is becoming dangerously close
because, uh...
my entire team is equipped with Kryptonite weapons.
I-I would give up Africa...
soon, the world will need all the help it can get.
and you've run out of time.
I need your help again.
is not who he says he is.
is just give me a minute to take it all in.
but why tell Lois who I really am, you turn out to be the one person I can believe in.
this is just another one of his deceits.
all their satellites have been destroyed.
I assume you brought the infamous secret weapon.
that you're putting another satellite online.
and this planet will be ours.
I'm the one who said 2012 would be just another y2k scare,
Yeah, I'm way ahead of you, but I'm a little lost.
the time has come to share in your birthright.
Ah, the station's motion sensors have picked you up.
I will not fail. I will destroy the Book of Rau.
my people are overtaking this planet,
you need to end this now.
I was worried that Clark would follow me.
I still can't believe you were right about Clark.
you don't have to take my word for it.
how can you be the Blur?
now I need the Book of Rau.
you're not really him.
because this isn't a trial, Clark.
and send our visitors on a fast train to Nirvana.
Clark.
to redeem myself.
we have our own satellite?
on your left-hand side, you're gonna find three panels.
I'm not leaving.
to another plane of existence, including you.
Krypton will live again.
might makes right!
if Zod has been trying to destroy satellites from space,
I say we move now and cause some pain.
he knows what we mean to each other.
well, let's fire up this intergalactic subway token
and if I don't tell you now...
then by dawn, we'll have the Book of Rau.
but I guarantee you'll find that Clark Kent but the transponders haven't been initiated for downlink yet.
so then we should just stay in touch the old-fashioned way.
at the earth station in order to be able to spy from the sky.
well, Lois, your...
you've refused to speak to me, Jor-El.
with armchair quarterbacks at the Pentagon?!
why don't you make your way home?
but now you need to accept that destiny for me.
Icarus flew to where he didn't belong.
and destroy anyone that ever opposed you!
her burns are just too severe. Let's call it.
I'm not going anywhere. And neither are they.
your abilities allow you to come back, Carter...
Corben to locate your fortress.
do you really think there's redemption for what I did?
I thought you said we'd never talk again.
I wouldn't do that to her.
I have the Book of Rau, Tess.
our soldiers have cut off their communications.
are the only one that can save us.
I won't forgive that deception.
so they have to have been dispersed around the world,
now, you dig a little deeper...
and I think there's another way to save Zod.
now, my destiny is here on Earth.
then you shall be the Savior of Kandor.
Lois, I don't know what you're talking about.
from Perry White
if anyone calls claiming to be me, don't believe them.
but I have a higher calling.
I once believed that my destiny was here on earth, you were there waiting for me.
I know you don't want to see it, Lois, but it's true.
look, up in the sky!
that said, I think we both know there're someone else
I'm listening.
he wants to know if you want pastrami or roast beef.
and Jor-El has sent me on trials to prove it.
to know the best way to win a war is to strike first.
I was made to see the error of my ways.
blue Kryptonite takes away my abilities, too.
there must be some other way to stop Zod.
I'm glad you broke radio silence, but why now?
just when it seems that you're out of my life for good,
it's not broken.
Olsen!
it's not your forgiveness that I'm looking for.
and he fell to his death from the heavens.
than to deceive the Blur's most devoted follower.
my soldiers know I have never wavered in the face of death.
is sort of out of the question now.
and then when I went away last fall, I...
time of death -- 3: 33 P. M.
I told you. I'm not going anywhere.
I know that you told me to save Zod...
Zod's symbols say one thing he wants a fight.
I'm s-so s-sorry...
my father would never skip on any chance to give me a lecture.
okay, completed the first level. I'm at the "t."
Chloe, if they find the signal, they'll trace me back to you!
I think you leaving Metropolis is the best thing...
is not what you think they were.
this is the only peaceful way to eliminate the threat.
I want to open up to her more than anything.
my people discovered you had the Book of Rau
Clark, I can't imagine being in this world without you.
and I think these crystals will also...
you are the best investigator I've known.
Yeah, you do, Clark.
Clark, as important as my career is to me...
just now that wherever you are, I'll be watching over you.
it's heading straight for the Daily Planet!
you can't protect us if we know who you are.
the last thing we remember is our blood being taken in Kandor.
do me a favor, okay? Just keep a low profile.
the world will need you.
if they knew the truth, they'd never follow you.
my mom inherited the Kryptonian library when Lionel died.
I-I know that things have been rocky between us, but...
I pulled the console from the rubble...
when I came back to the bullpen...
the honor was ours, Kal-El.
and share the secrets of Rau with him.
that's great. Congratulations.
to atone for my sins.
can you ever forgive me for thinking he was you?
when they were trying to turn the sun red.
we will deal with him once we're on our own soil.
look, my whole life has been full of relationshps
he's offered me a job at the foreign desk in Kenya.
maybe we could just grab some thai food and catch a movie?
that doesn't mean you can't at least say goodbye.
played the jealousy card once or twice...
then why would my father have gone silent in the fortress?
that you were the most important person in my life.
your fate is utterly binding.
but I tempted fate, and because of that, he died.
without a war, a war that no one will win...
I'm wearing green leather, so I'll do my best.
my only regret is I can see your heartbreak.
Icarus was on an ego trip.
Lois, there's nothing to tell you.
to your crow's nest a-above the city.
your father can't help you anymore.
I need you to be honest with me.
the one with JJ-910-60 is
the war has already begun.
you're about to learn what it feels like to get burned.
that alien snatcher, Chisholm, shot you.
uh... well, I guess giving you a sweater for your birthday they put together these crystals as an energy source
you touched the sun when you freed me from the orb.
I will use the Book of Rau...
where we an build a new home.
but she wasn't the only one who paid the price, was she?
now I'll make sure you'll never speak to your son again...
I will never deceive you like Clark did -- ever.
the Kandorians have been led astray by Zod.
my Earth father warned me not to play God...
right, because we need to protect Watchtower's database.
and I did it on-- only to s-save you from Zod.
because Zod destroyed the console in the fortress.
now the season finale of "Smallville.
and maybe your true purpose is to lead your own people.
you were willing to risk your life to save me, Lois.
well, what would make you stay?
I would stay for you.
you know, it's not what happened to you that destroyed this team, is it?
it's what happened to her.
what was she, your partner? - My wife.
Shayera and I were cursed by one of our enemies.
destined to fall in love, only to watch each other die.
we're not done.
I will hunt you, and I will find you.
you understand?
you don't even know who I am...
...Green Arrow.
with you, he has a purpose.
I wish I could have given him that.
and it kills me.
cause you have everything right in front of you.
and you can't even see it.
so, what do you say, kid -- Africa?
Perry White -- he's offered me a job at the Foreign Desk in Kenya.
I think you leaving Metropolis is the best thing...
for you right now.
Perry. It's Lane.
I really hope this story is worth it, because so far my dream assignment is turning into "1, 001 Arabian Nightmares.
and you know what? I really hope per diem covers the 11-hour camel ride.
and as for this newly unearthed Tomb of Isis
all I see are some rocks and a couple of tents.
call me.
Hello?
Lois Lane, Daily Planet.
they were star-crossed lovers.
guess you never know what fate has planned for you.
Chloe, where are you?
I've left four messages.
Jor-El warned me some dark force is coming.
I need your help.

I just baked them this morning. Really gooey, so be careful.
I use twice the sugar.
no relation to that woman on tv. I get that a lot.
welcome to The Daily Planet.
can I tell you how excited I am to be working at The Planet?
after all those weeks at the small-town paper, my words are finally going to have a real impact.
so you said "weeks"?
classic overachiever. Got that from my granddaddy.
back home, I basically owned the front page of the paper.
mean Arrow: Hero Destoys Playground
now I can finally have an influence on millions of people.
hero mania? I say hero menace!
don't tell me these masked, anarchy-loving vigilantes are out there to protect my kids.
don't tell me some abomination who is too grotesque to show his face but vandalizes our town with the letter "S" is a hero!
what's the "S" stand for, huh?
I'll tell you what. "Shame"!
H. R. doesn't allow us to listen to the radio during work hours.
bummer.
I'll get you the podcast.
you know, Godfrey is so right. About everything.
let's find you a permanent desk.
this one belongs to someone on temporary leave.
she's the one who got this whole thing started.
calling those costumed vigilantes heroes?
please. Like it's not totally obvious she's in love with The Blur.
Lois Lane is the best crime reporter this paper ever had.
now, there is a desk available over here by the copy machine.
wait a minute, Mr. busy boots.
I don't think you get it.
I'm your new partner.
metropolis Police Missing Persons No Record Found For Chloe Sullivan
no Record Found
I got your message.
I have to say, it wasn't the call I was expecting.
Chloe's gone.
well, you've been with her for five months, right?
sounds like things are right on schedule.
no, it's not like that. She just disappeared.
no warning, no phone call, nothing.
trust never was the golden rule for the kids in this clubhouse.
well, you'd just fit right in, then, wouldn't you?
now, if you think I'm gonna sit around here and do nothing, just wait for my girlfriend to come back like Clark's doing, you don't know me very well at all.
low blow.
I'd say Clark's using every ounce of strength he has not to skip over the Azores and bring Lois home.
he respects Lois enough.
maybe that's because Lois hasn't completely disappeared.
there's no digital record of Chloe Sullivan anywhere.
no Record Found
it's like she never existed.
the only one who could erase Chloe is Chloe.
come on, now, Tess. Don't underestimate yourself.
although, I do have to say, I thought the e-mail was a touch much.
I never thought I'd have to tell you how I feel about us, "because the smile on my lips when I looked at you...
pretty much said it all.
but now that you won't be seeing it anymore, "I'll have to use words to tell you.
I've never loved anyone the way I've loved you.
and I never will again.
you will always be my brightest star, my knight in shining leather, my hero.
Oliver, this might be difficult for you to face, but...
I didn't write this.
we both know Chloe did.
I did help her reset the system, though.
and in a bizarre way, she knew that I was the only one who would understand.
why'd she do this?
I just know it's what she wanted.
I trusted that she had a plan.
maybe it's time you trust her, too.
and I thought those "Sex and The City" girls had gaudy taste.
you might tell that to its owner, the goddess queen Isis.
she spent eternity searching for the cut-up pieces of her dead husband.
Yeah, I can relate to that.
my relationship just broke up into a zillion tiny pieces, and I don't know how to put it all back together again.
so, you're a bona fide Indiana Jones?
they fly you in to make sure that these aren't lifted from some souvenir shop in Cairo?
and that they're intact and well-preserved.
in other words, hands off.
I know the Egyptians were big on the afterlife,

so, why was this Hawk guy so important?
it's said that each day he traveled across the sky and through the Underworld to be born again at sunrise.

thank you, Ati.
I have to admit this assignment
a little out of my strike zone.
I mean, I was raised by a very grounded four-star general who believed in what you can see, touch...
blow up.
things that can be explained.
it's just...
you can live your whole life without any proof of something, like a
a God or...Whatever, and then one day you look up and realize the guy sitting across from you is...
RA.
you think the guy sitting across from you is an ancient sun God?
no. Of course not.
but what if he were?
one minute, you know you know what you know, and the next, you realize you don't really know anything, but you want to know everything.
what is the world like for him?
does he feel pain?
how does he heal?
when does he sleep?
does he even sleep?
this is gonna require something stronger than tea.
how can he stand driving in a car when they move so much slower than he does?
that would drive me crazy!
maybe you should just ask Clark.
now, why don't you sit down...
before you drive me...
crazy?

my granddaddy always told me,"seatbelts save lives.
Oh, my gosh. Clark...
we almost died.
Hi. No, no. Don't tell him that it's me.
he'll just...Get upset.
look, I'm not gonna be able to make the pick-up tonight.
I'll call as soon as I can. Okay, got to go.
you want to tell me what you got caught up in?
I mean, someone did just try to kill you.
I was valedictorian.
I mean, trust me, nobody wants to kill a valedictorian.
maybe they got you mixed up with someone else.
would you listen to yourself?
you sound an awful lot like Lois Lane.
conspiracy around every corner.
always railing against the establishment, against the normal people.
normal"?
like you and me.
God, it must have been hard listening to Lois' justifications for all these alternative values and lifestyles.
Lifestyles"?
don't act like some good, corn-fed boy-next-door like you is going to try to tell me that these vigilantes are part of the natural plan.
I mean, it would be one thing if they actually had remorse... Or wanted to change.
but, you know, they have no moral center.
well, that's easy to say when they can't come out and defend themselves.
sure they can.
they could come out of the shadowy gutters into the light so we could see them any day.
they just choose not to.
you know, Godfrey says that they
look, stop.
I found something.
the police found a bullet in the engine block.
Oh, my God.
why would anyone want to kill me?
look, we should get you someplace safe.
my friends won't mind if you stay at their apartment.
no one will be looking for you in Smallville.
don't move.
my self-defense teacher said never stop moving unless you're dead.
Oh, my gosh. It's you.
Oh, just get it over with!
I should have known you masked creeps were following me after your little car bomb backfired this morning!
you call yourself a hero, but really, you're just an arrow for hire!
trust me. I'm not doing this for the money.
face it, Robin Hood.
you and your boys do this for no one but yourselves.
I'm not a criminal, Lady.
Oh, yeah. That's what they all say.
but I've got eyewitness testimony... And photos... To back it up that a group of you heroes have been torturing innocent people by the old brewery at the docks!
give me that.
see? That's exactly what I'm talking about.
cat Grant Personnel Record
all you had to do was ask.
cat Grant isn't who she says she is.
I knew you two would have a lot in common.
her real name is Mary Louise Shroger, and that's not the only secret she's keeping.
let's face it, Clark. You're not gonna like anyone sitting in Lois' chair.
so why don't you just take a coffee break, run to the Sahara, and bring her back?
Lois left for a reason. If I care for her, I'll respect that.
how progressive of you.
if you really believe it.
look, the point is, something weird is going on with Cat.
she's making suspicious phone calls.
and this morning, she almost got blown up in her car.
an explosion was caused by a bullet somehow lodged perfectly in the combustion chamber.
it's engraved.
the only letters visible are a-r-n-t.
I think I've seen this work before.
let's hope I'm wrong.
you know who did this?
if it's the op I'm thinking of, it was a top target of Checkmate, one of the few they never got and one of the even fewer they feared.
FBI Five Most Wanted Fugitive
I can see why.
number three on Interpol's most wanted and top five on FBI and CIA.
strikes targets with surgical precision...
and assassinates all witnesses.
what's his name?
checkmate never could I. D. him.
they just called him "Deadshot.
you failed to mention what exactly it was I was dealing with.
I don't make it a practice of letting my targets walk away.
that was just a test.
had to make sure we were after the right guy.
you should have told me.
I thought we were supposed to be on the same team.
you should be thanking me.
I just handed you the hit of a lifetime.
why would I thank you for something fate gave me?
somewhere out there, we all got a bullet with our name on it.
I thought you were one of those so-called heroes.
thank God it's only you.
you know, you should really get yourself a bulletproof vest like me.
we all think we're made of steel, but...Really we're just made of marshmallows.
cat, are you all right?
well, I was just attacked by Green Arrow.
I mean, this is all part of that vigilante agenda.
and why would he want to hurt you?
the last thing they want is an honest-abe reporter like me working at The Planet and exposing the truth about them.
if you're really about the truth, then why'd you lie to me?
you se to be hiding a few secrets of your own.
I have no idea what you are talking about.
why'd you change your name?
that's Adam.
my son.
he's with his grandparents until this all blows over.
his dad and I went out for almost two years.
I thought I'd found my prince charming, but little did I know, they don't exist.
you just have to be patient.
you know, I thought I had found somebody who could make me happy.
Really?
think you'll get back together?
I used to.
but now I'm not sure.
it's funny...
when doing what you think is right for someone, it can feel so...
wrong.
how about you and this guy?
well, Clark, not every guy's as nice as you.
I had to get Adam away from it.
I'm sorry.
does he know where you are?
I changed my name so he couldn't find us.
I had so much I was fighting for.
trying to change the world.
and now I have to hide behind the power of the pen and a new name, making sure nobody knows who's behind the words I'm printing.
kind of like the vigilantes.
must have been scary escaping from him.
all I know is I protected my son.
you know, the world may never see me as some big hero...
...but maybe someday my son will.
new Message From: Tess Mercer Meet me at the Planet... URGENT!!
I have to go.
what about the Green Arrow and those freaks that tried to blow me up?
they know where I am!
just stay here. You'll be safe.
I'll be back. I promise.
it feels like somehow I was destined to be with Clark, but his destiny is so much bigger, and the last thing that I would ever want is to be the one thing that holds him back or stands in the way.
and what if you're exactly the thing that might help him be the person you know he can be?
what if you're the one who makes his burden easier to bear?
do you think that's why he sent you?
to make sure I was safe?
he worries about you.
he still thinks you don't know about his powers.
see, that's another reason for me to be here.
when it comes to big secrets, I'm not exactly Mata Hari.
I could blow it all for him.
with every great relationship, Lois, comes a great burden...
...and the strength to carry it.
okay. Well...
I better get my beauty sleep.
all this dry heat.
I'd like you to have something.
it was given to me by my wife.
it's a story...
about two star-crossed lovers.
prince Khufu and Shayera were murdered by an evil man, but...
their love was so strong, they were bonded for all eternity.
lifetime after lifetime, they were reborn...
to find their one true love...
...only to lose each other in death again.
that's a terrible story.
I like it.
if you're into the whole Egyptian "groundhog day" thing.
after many years, khufu grew tired of always waiting to find his beloved...
...so he traveled the world...
seeking other women...
trying to forget Shayera.
unable to rid her from his heart, he returned home, resigned to his fate.
no sooner did he arrive at the palace when...
he saw her.
she was there all along, but he didn't recognize her because the time wasn't right.
he needed to wait, because it made their love stronger...
...and their kiss that much sweeter.
try that again, and the next thing kissing your lips will be my fist.
I had LuthorCorp's ballistic people up all night taking apart that slug from Cat's car.
I appreciate that. Thanks.
I'm not asking for your thanks, Clark, just your trust.
you need me.
you said this was urgent.
after the lab techs pulled apart the bullet and reassembled it...
they found this.
generating Composite...
the target is me.
guess our assassin never was after "Hello Kitty.
this guy doesn't know that car explosions and bullets don't hurt me.
it's possible he was just testing you, to see what you're made of.
why hasn't he come after me again?
maybe he didn't realize how difficult of a target you are.
this guy never gives up.
and he gets every detail right.
there must be more to his plan.
if he knows you're faster than his bullets, the only place to aim is at someone he knows you'll save.
maybe you'll be there to...
act as a shield.
it's Cat. I have to get back to Smallville.
too late.
our kitten reporter is already on the move.

pack up Adam's things and have them ready.
someone's after me, and he may know about us.
I liked you better as a blonde.
why are you doing this to me?
I didn't do anything.
funny thing about fate
you can't outrun it.
either it's your day or it's not, Sweetpea.
please, no.
my son...
he's just 2 years old.
I'm all he's got.
trust me.
he'll get over you.
in three or four years, he won't even remember your face.
people about to die always think that that special loved one won't be able to go on without 'em.
but the truth is, that person will just find someone else to love.
everyone is replaceable.
I used to think everyone could be saved, even those superhero freaks.
but now I realize...
some people are just born dead.

I'm fine.
thanks to my bulletproof vest.
don't leave home without it, Clark Kent.
U can never be too safe.
well I'll be sure to pick one up.
see? I don't need a masked hero to rescue me.
I've got a real flesh-and-blood one right here.
people need to see someone's heart to believe in them.
we need to be inspired by people who stand out in the light, not people who shrink into the shadows.
we need a good All-American hero in red, white, and blue.
or at least red and blue.
did you miss me?
you know, I got to say, we had something special.
you didn't crack on the first beating.
you made me work for it.
well, I'm glad it was good for you, too.
take it easy, there, Commando.
I'm just a guy over here with a bow and arrow.
you're wasting your talent, Queen.
you could make a real difference out there.
tide is turning.
people are getting nervous about vigilantes roaming the streets, taking the decisions and the glory out of the hands of the suits in power.
I'm not running for office. I'm just putting bad guys in jail.
well, it's gonna get tougher the longer you and your little league of heroes stay half in, half out.
that's the beauty of my group.
everybody thinks we're dead.
we could use you.
but this is your one and only offer.
you raise a good point.
on the other hand, you did just shoot me.
Where's...Chloe Sullivan?! Where is she?!
I'm sorry.
I can't hear you.
where...is Chloe... Sullivan?!
it wasn't a kidnapping.
it was a trade.
trade for what?!
you!
you would have been proud of her.
she didn't crack.
she downed a cyanide pill just to save your life.
she's dead.
Chloe is, uh, gone.
what do you mean?
those people who were holding me at that old brewery-- she
she traded herself in so I could be free.
who are these people? What do they want with Chloe?
just a group of people that call themselves crime fighters.
they think we should all remain hidden in the shadows.
they tried to torture her, Clark.
she beat them at their own game. She took a cyanide pill.
no. Chloe wouldn't...
and then she took this.
I found that at her apartment.
I had it tested, and there's traces of a cyanide antidote in there.
she faked her own death.
she was planning to go.
she saw the future.
she put on Dr. Fate's helmet trying to find you and said it was gonna be okay.
you just let her go?
I had no idea she was leaving.
she put on the Fate helmet, Clark. That should have told you something.
look, I understand how much she means to you, Oliver, but for years she's been asking us to treat her as one of us.
she begged me to trust her and the decisions that she made.
if she put this much planning and thought into leaving, she knew what she was doing.
I go out every night, and I protect unfamiliar faces so that they can go home and be with the people that they care about.
and the one person that I should have been protecting the most...
...I failed her.
we didn't choose this.
we both know this is what we were born to do.
you playing the fate card?
that what you're doing again? That's what gets you through the day?
you sit around and do nothing while these people that we protect, they paint us as vigilantes, Clark!
the woman that you love ran away!
you think I don't want to go get Lois and bring her back?
they left us, Oliver.
with our lives, we can't blame them.
well, what if we hadn't remained hidden?
what if we didn't put our identities out there to be held hostage?
would this still be happening?
Clark, I think we have to forge a new fate here.
we've lost way too much.
something's got to change.
not even a hello?
rotting in jail ain't my idea of a good time.
your draw.
you nailed your target.
now let's get you out of here.
about time.
I'm sorry. What's redneck for "bite me"?

our costumed counterparts are officially tagged and released.

let's give these boys a taste of what it's like to mess with the Suicide Squad.
about last night -- I'm sorry.
I guess I got a little too caught up in my story.
you forgot to mention the most important part.
it was an autobiography.
I found this... In the book.

Lois, surely you don't think that...
let's just say I wasn't born yesterday.
you're not the only one of Clark's friends with a...
mysterious past.
Clark did say you were wise beyond your years.
I hope last night will remain between us.
I'm not sure Clark would forgive me if he knew.
some leads are better left buried.
so, if you were just here to babysit me as a favor to Clark, what was with the heart-to-heart?
something tells me that story time wasn't exactly part of the agreement.
It'S...my wife.
I've been hearing her in my thoughts, and last night I had a vision of her.
when that happens, I know I'll be joining her soon in a new life.
but to do that, I must first leave this one.

Like...Die?
it's time I meet my destiny, Lois.
but before I go, I wanted you to meet yours.
he can't do it without you.
you're his Shayera.
Carter, I am not like you and Shayera and...
Clark.
my future is here in Africa.
you know, the philosopher Nietzsche believed we shouldn't live for the future, but for the present.
he thought that people who chased after some far-off future dream were really running away from their true destiny.
Yeah, well, Nietzsche can call me a chicken if he wants, but has never dated someone like Clark Kent.
it wouldn't have mattered.
to him, the true hero was the person who embraced the life that he or she was given and made it better.
he called that person "ubermensch.
a Superman.
Nietzche believed that all of us could be one.
in our own way.
where is she?
well, I'm your publicist.

stop the menace
even heroes.
you sound like my father, misguided.
Mr. Queen. Mr. Queen.
and like so many others,
but we have a problem.
kind of makes you wonder
it just is.
I shouldn't have helped you.
she puts you in danger, too.
was taking care of others,
because you're pure of spirit.
you won't have a choice.
he does?
how many times do you hear about victims
I've missed you.
not a bad read.
pretty public, so it can't be hard to find him.
what -- what is this?
I'm sorry.
take it easy, Gordon.
they're unnatural, driven by...
I like it.
and crucify her tomorrow.
let's take five, guys.
if this darkness came through a gateway,
tempting.
I'm here for Lois.
strangest thing about Miss Grant
but I guess the purple feathers
I know all about preemptive strikes, okay?
and it's time to pay the piper.
that I was destined to fail.
I'm not actually here to talk about me.
just saved your skin.
I tried to bring the blur to me.
pretty strong words from a guy
you're superpowered.
think about it, Clark.
no, look, I just need to figure it out.
she not only puts herself in danger,
when you're the center of attention.
and showed his face like Kara.
if you're not gonna seriously step up
email photos Sending
they claim to uphold laws,
are you all right?
don't you think I should take a look?
like I told you she was.
is that a trick question?
I will never help you.
it's too bad.
which, unfortunately, included me.
you're sexy.
impressive.
I couldn't just stand by and let that happen.
you're gonna eventually let them down later on.
not send it away.
you could've been killed.
so...
what happened? Is she okay?
to anyone or anything.
does this have anything to do
I sort of banded together a group of heroes.
I have people investigating.
easy with the dress-down, buddy.
Lois.
let her go.
should've been a dead giveaway, huh?
you've proven yourself
let off some steam.
Jor-El should have come to me.
Alliterate much?
and I don't think she's coming back.
it's just you're such a bang-up gal and all,
a darkness has come to earth.
didn't want it getting into the wrong hands.
because it's gone on long enough.
you never know.
and Kara could learn a thing or two from him.
three weeks ago?
like that butterfly?
fight all you want.
break out the marshmallows, Clark.
you must've been pretty surprised
club Desaad
what's happening? What are you doing, Oliver?
but the blur is different.
I searched so long for my mother,
they're dodging taxes.
we should cast a pretty wide net.
and if you hadn't jumped between us
you'll shatter like glass.
there we go.
Lois has served her purpose.
you're powerful.
it's safer for all the heroes. - Maybe.
he knows who you are.
godfrey!
I was wondering.
you call yourself a journalist,
lawless mutants like the blur
maybe it's easier to be a hero
if I can plant an idea,
I say no!
that's Lois.
and I haven't seen it.
how's that for tying up loose ends?
girls, why don't you go
what is this place?
and kick this creep to the curb, then I will.
your ex-boyfriend, I believe.
she may fly, that even the purest person ...if you put them on too high of a pedestal,
I'm doing this for you.
I know how much trouble you must've gone to to get this.
I think I liked it better when I was showing you the ropes.
between you and me, I was terrified.
they'll hang themselves.
it could be anywhere.
I don't know what's gotten into you lately.
what inspired you to become the masked archer?
it made sense.
what have you done with her?
we were gonna cover the signing.
now imagine that creature
I'm gonna roast this turkey.
Kara?
who can't even figure out his own powers.
and they don't even know who it was?
open your eyes, people!
Yeah.
gotcha.
I mean everyone around her.
but still, you risked your soul to save me.
I want to touch every soul.
take me to Club Desaad.
of course...
she put me in danger?
thank you all for coming.
the Maiden of Might"? Seriously?
I'm a torque-wrench virgin.
this is how we access the news feeds.
I think I know how it came here.
I need you to get behind that.
it's gonna take more
three weeks ago it was a big break for your career.
maiden of Might
not a bad different -- I just don't know
Thanks, Clark, but I get it fighting my battles for me anymore, Lois.
no, she's, uh
they pretend to be your saving grace.
cat?
but...
all you have to do is give them enough rope.
now, if you really care about family,
stand up for the American dream.
it's called watchtower, but it's more of a command post.
doing what I have to.
if we put too much faith in these vigilantes.
Oh. Kinky.
and I thought the fortress was your only hideaway.
and she was willing to give up everything to protect it,
Ah, I'm glad to see that
you've felt this way before.
and, I'm...
your heart is racing.
it's why you could never lure the darkness to you, - who were mugged... - Do you hear that?
than a loudmouth with a deviant sex life - Destiny. - That old thing?
Jor-El has given me a mission, or I'm gonna burn all the fur off your arms.
he's got a personal vendetta against heroes.
after they see all these sexy photos.
well, I'm -- I'm sure the blur knows gave you the banner headline?
by your cousin's superhero status.
he has a secret chapter about you,
dangerous.
that I was gonna mess things up for Clark.
you hurt them first so you don't have to worry about the ways with all of your saves.
in the meantime, I can handle a few slings and arrows.
you're seething with ambition.
Lois, I think you went too far
I'll call you later.
I guess change is in the air.
why all of a sudden the cover-up?
with you, it's all about the byline.
and drown them in some holy water, Mister.
what do you think of my new look?
and it is safer for you if you're in the shadows.
and this guy's probably not even on the blur's radar.
you can't save people
you said he disowned me, and I want to know why.
surprise seeing you today.
I shouldn't have gone against your father's wishes.
yours truly picked Godfrey's pocket, behind some glasses and go undercover until I know earth is safe from the darkness
I can see that you're pure of heart.
you're doubting your powers.
I'm not gonna stand here and do nothing.
let's split up. We'll cover more ground.
that driver with Godfrey.
what if you can't fight it on your own?
I need to find Kara.
no matter what he's afraid of,
you always said the most important thing
I need you to understand that.
maybe people deserve to know the truth.
three weeks ago, you were a small-time radio host.
just leave it to me.
Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.
I mean, I-I reach for the sky,
the turmoil is overwhelming.
and the world just falls away.
then you give them whiplash racing back because you regret it.
to lift them up out of the darkness
I'm sorry.
with why Chloe took an extended vacation?
Chloe's not catching a tan on a beach somewhere,
there is a guy out there -- Gordon Godfrey
and the other superpowered mutants.
I just ran for the hills because I thought
there's no point in confronting Jor-El.
out of the darkness and into the light.
the people of this planet would be doomed.
or maybe the cost of keeping my secret is too high,
this Godfrey guy -- he's everywhere.
what are you gonna do with me?
this is bigger than just Jor-El.
I didn't want to hurt you.
they're thumbing their noses in the face
mortal combat meets wood-chipper.
it's called superspeeding, folks.
what is this?
send them in, please.
I miss you, too.
Yes, sir.
of truth, justice, and the American way.
are using this power... - That's it.
he's my hero.
50 bucks says the crackpot with the blur in his bonnet
if you want a quote, you'll have to get in line.
maybe Godfrey's book wouldn't get so much attention.
we both know that.
come on, great! You're sweet.
I was the one sent to earth to protect it.
I want to be on every television, ...serving our country instead of himself.
and I need your help.
you will not be saved.
smash your body up against his,
wow, they -- they were fake.
Oliver, Godfrey's got proof.
it can find the one morsel of doubt
Kal-El, if this dark force and he's gonna post it online tomorrow.
that Godfrey was gonna reveal today.
you'd rather put the world at risk and trust Jor-El
people would be able to trust him.
you're frustrated. You can't focus.
really trying to live my life in a way
look into your hearts.
I am Green Arrow.
your captivating cuz needs to hide those baby blues
you won't be able to escape your fate.
you sounded a little scary there.
this has to stop.
I can't, uh -- I can't have the people that I love
it's time to sign off now,
I thought you wanted me to take the job.
a pariah so disfigured
Godfrey was undermining Metropolis' faith in its defenders.
you're my only family.
Yeah, mutant vigilantes?
and people will swarm her with love today
they're going to find something on her it becomes their secret, too.
underneath all of that bravado,
they wrestle with their own flaws.
I mean, it's great.
it can see your thoughts and feelings.
you saw those crowds, Clark,
things are about to heat up in here.
she actually was supposed to meet me here.
you've been a bad boy.
he said you're not ready.
Yeah.
I'm sure you think of people without powers
and he thinks that Green Arrow is my ex-boyfriend.
how did it become so powerful?
there's nothing out there I can't handle.
that he is just taking potshots to sell books.
now the whole city's listening.
bless my soul, it's Lois Lane.
africa managed to survive the whole Lois Lane invasion.
he doesn't dare show his face?
what's your favorite tool?
I need you to take me further.
but when a person that you love knows your secret, doesn't realize they have inside of them.
one of these so-called vigilantes
people deserve to be saved.
they're predators, plain and simple. - He's been
taking over that body would have been fun.
it will grow until it devours when you don't have somebody tying you down.
I know he will always be there for me.
your cousin needs a better handle.
I've never known you to surrender
I just thought it might get a little...lonely.
and you can't even fly?
we're small, but we're loud.
how his chocolate and my peanut butter are gonna mix.
you know, let the blowhard eventually blow himself out.
I know this isn't easy for you.
tell me, what brings little miss cut-and-run back to town?
but nobody's gonna believe a word you have to say
I can see it.
maybe Jor-El underestimated you.
Yeah, a meteor rock -- that's what happened.
and when people stop believing in you, but you're just a blind follower of these vigilantes.
it's been a long time, Kal-El.
the host is probably a leader with influence.
about that
that's a horrible idea.
who are counting on these vigilantes
you know the doubt in your heart.
well, what you're doing right now flies in the face
looks like Godfrey was downtown a few hours ago.
I'm pretty good with a torque wrench.
these vigilantes is just gunning for a little attention.
your bracelet seemed to repel the darkness,
and what about this blur
you're the woman of tomorrow -- today.
that the superpowered are people, too.
gave me evidence that the archer a seed of doubt, within people,
I have nothing to hide.
give me the key, Kara. I want to talk to my father.
she's no Lois Lane.
to stop me.
maybe someone figured out where she flew off to.
too bad you have more to worry about right now than a 2x4.
the dark spirit would have possessed you, Kal-El.
I don't feel pure of spirit.
she was infected the last time she was in town.
but these pretenders live in shadows.
thinks it'll prey upon some weakness inside of me.
I can't believe I just said that out loud.
you think it's just gonna wait around until you're ready?
I think we'll go far together, you and I.
I'm sorry.
there is darkness in you and great power.
misguided.
Kal-El,
he says you're no longer his son.
how much are those photos worth to you?
I kept the only copy close to me for safekeeping.
you didn't come to earth to be the first superpowered pin-up girl.
all their doubts and mistrust.
you've been on earth all this time,
they're really into this guy, aren't they?
Kara, this doesn't feel like much of a favor.
how long have you been in town?
congratulations, Lois.
since leather and lace really isn't planet fare.
well, why would she flaunt her special skills?
you just have to trust me, Kal-El.
so you can rest assured that your secret is safe.
of how I've chosen to live on this planet my whole life.
wow, Lois. 007's got nothing on you.
you, sin-on-a-stick, you just, you know,
three weeks ago, I was on this rooftop,
but in the end, Lois, she did win them over.
you know, I think we just leave him alone.
who's your mama?
the secret stays with me.
wielding all of your powers.
to cover a dog-sled race in Alaska.
the whole world? Exactly how do you propose to do that?
Godfrey's not so special.
are committing crimes and getting away with it.
what if I share my evidence condemning Oliver Queen,
you'll do anything, sacrifice anyone, for the story.
done and done.
let's take a break. - Okay.
coming out is a -- is a terrible, terrible move.
now that you got me under your control, and they are not these faceless mutants,
just tell me! Where is she?!
trying to discredit this annoying hero-basher.
it was like he could see inside me.
on your embarrassing save by a certain girl wonder?
after the trials and all the training that I've gone through.
I think it's time to blow this bondage ball.
are you sure you can win against me?
and your saintly suffering will be just the lure I need
there's only one way for me to set the record straight.
I've been trying to draw it towards me so I can stop it.
your final chapter's going online tomorrow,
I hope you're right...
in every newspaper, on every computer screen.
okay, I have a street security camera with a limo.
he's afraid that I'll fail,
maybe if the blur was more honest
you mean something like "Go to Africa, Lois"?
according to the computers at the watchtower, yeah.
you know, you're not fooling anyone racking up all these airline miles.
that is the only copy on the chapter of Green Arrow
tell me what you're doing here and stop avoiding the question.
maybe I could give you something that's worth more.
I'm not thinking of anything. I'm just in the moment.
she must've had a close encounter with a meteor rock.
you said the dark spirit came through a tear in the universe.
I can't believe people would turn on their heroes that fast.
is really a certain depraved playboy
thank you. I appreciate it.
this isn't your fight.
why don't you take a break tonight?
but it's how you overcome it that defines you.
well, obviously.
look, are you sure that Lois' cellphone was tracked here?
and I'm not the only one. I can see that.
I don't think the bracelet will work as a portal and...Spank each other or something?
you're a formidable woman, Lois Lane.
I can't have other people risking their lives for me.
thank god uber girl -- power girl
it's kind of hard to explain, but just try to...blend in.
and after everything we've been through together,
you wish you could kill me.
you so-called heroes are false gods, all of you.
he's the one who's confused, because I know my own destiny.
it's like he could see things in me I didn't want to face.
and I opened a portal using the book of rao.
why wouldn't the darkness want you?
who knew Mr. Family Values had such a dark side?
mega girl was there to save me from the gallows.
I know how she feels about you. She'll be back.
then they turn on you and violate your trust.
that's right. Make him pay.
this blustering blowhard just crossed the line.
she was, um, conveniently volunteered
I think you look completely different.
the darkness came through a rip in the universe three weeks ago.
I know about your little shortcut to the fortress.
somebody should put Godfrey in some serious restraints.
that's too bad.
I brought you here to make an announcement.
what can you say about the blur?
you are officially fodder for the tabloids.
unless the dark spirit is trapped inside of a host.
Bye-bye, Barbie dream desk.
you're a brilliant and talented super sleuth.
and you -- you are the girl his mama warned him about.
the more I try to clear my mind, the more I hear.
a buddy of mine at the inquisitor ran it for me
I guess this is easy for you, huh?
mom. Hey, dad.
I haven't been beholden to anyone.
what? What is it?
terrified for the innocent people of this country,
failure is something we all have to live with.
these illegal aliens are stealing our jobs.
has gotten her in... way over her head.
the truth is...She left,
but it can't possess someone who's pure of spirit,
Lois, since I've had my abilities,
you can't come at this thing without all of your abilities.
I have just as many issues as anyone else.
you think you have all the answers.
I guess even heroes need someone to come home to, huh?
I don't care about the photos, Lois!
Oh, that's a little harsh, don't you think?
it's the truth, Kal-El.
right, well, um...
it takes advantage of people's doubts.
you know what I am.
before a hero-hater like Godfrey turns his sights on her.
who has true clarity of purpose, but your father
unless you're disappointed I'm not blonder?
wait. I -- I think that she probably just needs space.
their powers serve their secret vigilante agenda.
Kal-El, instead of trying to force the noise out,
this dark force is like a disease.
we know who our real heroes are,
no, I just figured that something happened.
it's not flying if it's mostly falling.
is this the kind of savior you want your children believing in?
great photos -- definitely page-one material.
a connection of mine who has toyed with him
make it your whole world.
but I need you to leave the darkness to me.
these aberrations skulking in the shadows.
let's just put these up here, huh?
okay, well, guess I have to trust you.
their faith in each other and in these heroes.
and what you did was brave.
but I have a feeling that blonde bimbo is no angel.
people have these so-called vigilantes all wrong.
well, I may, um -- maybe I said that, but I
and getting my powers and image around the city are a part of it.
there's two sides to everyone...
sorry about the lame letter. I'm lousy at goodbyes.
now, where were we?
you know, it's easy for people to just see the powers
you can save your holier-than-thou, made-for-tv platitudes
his secret identity will be revealed
maybe the blur isn't the hero he thinks he is.
live inside that one noise.
why don't you just focus on one thing...
you're afraid you'll never be the hero you want to be.
any citizen who's been a victim of the vigilante menace, possesses someone with abilities like yours,
even his true believers' faith will be shaken.
and, I, uh...
I think the hunter has became the hunted.
when I release the final chapter of my book online tomorrow.
he's let you go, Kal-El.
a true believer of these vigilantes.
this is Gordon Godfrey saying night, y'all.
these creatures lurk in dark corners of our society.
but a big thank-you to my loyal followers.
a lot's changed since the last time I saw you, Kal-El.
humans are the best architects of their own undoing.
Gordon, that interview was hot, hot, hot.
I, uh, sort of feel like I've let you down.
he gave you a mission?
my worst fear is to be alone in the world without heroes.
well, yeah. She didn't tell me about it.
that would make you, uh, proud of me.
sort of trying to figure out how to live with that.
and then I never found her.
and not the person behind them.
but I failed at that.
I had to come back to the one place in the universe I have family.
no one. I say stop the menace.
don't put your faith in this hero menace.
as -- well, differently.
faithless, they will be ready to be led down a new path.
but the evil that's coming is like nothing you've ever seen.
looks like somebody wants to be punished, huh?
she risked people's lives in a ploy to undermine the message of my book.
just remember that heroes like her, or the blur...
Kara, off the record, what is it like to have powers?
all I'm saying is uber girl makes for a great headline,
it's critical I get my image around the city as quickly as possible.
and I feel like there's nothing holding me back.
how would you feel if someone started poking around in your life?
I've been, um...
her idealism and blind faith in the vigilantes she loves
she -- she sacrificed everything to protect me.
she brought one of you to me.
you look like a man who needs a little corrupting.
I'm on the hunt for a little distraction.
but now that you're back, are we, uh...partners?
but I do know one vigilante who does -- Green Arrow.
no, it's -- it's not easy or hard.
I've used my bracelet before to open a portal.
now, hands off the merchandise.
the woman that I, uh -- that I love...
Lois.
besides, you know what?
I haven't, Lois.
Bak-bak, crows!
and hardworking.
Yes.
any calls?
who felt that way.
back?
shut up?
why do it?
Yeah.
first I'll eat...
thank you.
than the Kents.
I'm sorry?
I need to get back. - To do what?
how
what thunder?
why show me this?
23 days.
come on, Clark.
look, I
is gonna make my day.
I am Green Arrow.
he's my father.
you heard what they said.
dad?
doesn't everybody?
Perry? What the hell?
sorry.
then I'll mate.
in your senior year.
let's just try this.
to darkness.
I'm sorry.
well, no worries.
I need you on the roof.
Bak-bak, Crow.
my sake?
Clark Kent.
on a smoke break.
this isn't a memory.
this isn't your fight.
we've been through weirder things.
sitting around counting your money?
I got kids.
Seriously?
so, what do you think?
funny
the rest of the world does.
he was just protecting me.
it's not every place
okay.
yeah?
what is it?
you.
everything you need to know
I didn't mean to come off so Lois.
I know we agreed
okay, listen, why don't you check
2017/10/15
he set me straight.
I lost sight of the present.
I'm sorry.
exactly.
I know that it's because you have
you're Lois Lane.
Nietzsche?
should I know you?
the hero that you say you are, after what happened with Lana.
not green?
I could really use it right now,
look who's talking.
but he does.
Lana and Clark were perfect.
Lois...
that it could actually happen.
in 10 minutes.
you know that.
the whole "last son of Krypton" thing
it's safer for all the heroes.
I hope so, for your sake.
not exactly.
welcome Back 2010
when did I start taking orders?
Oh, no.
and just kind of mutated.
there's a nuclear reactor about to blow
weren't you about to hang up your shield?
where do you want to start?
what happens when they grow up
if you know what I mean?
I mean, how many cheerleaders
Hey! Watch it!
you were right, dad.
it's me.
your trunk of tchotchkes at the farm?
I have an early deadline tomorrow.
but I don't understand what it is
if you knew it was gonna happen, then why didn't you stop it?
Lois...
you're right on time.
but that's all it took.
and actually...
come on. Did you forget?
and you can't even fly?
he didn't have a choice.
that I have a darkness within me, and I am not gonna miss it.
strawberry-ade.
are you kidding?
well, look who it is.
that all of these miraculous saves
maybe none of us are.
that's a record in my book.
that Chloe wrote about in the torch
if you're trying to save me somehow,
I need the legion ring.
interesting outcome.
all I've ever done was protect her
Ow!
do not underestimate me.
Chloe Sullivan
the Blur, I mean.
you're from the future.
I told you it's not him.
I left you a message.
let it go.
Clark!
Oh?
and fortress disks and stuff?
Clark?
it's...
Lana Lang
Chloe's my cousin.
you seriously never considered
what?
the blur.
and lucky for you, I have a spare.
good morning, Metropolis.
all of a sudden everyone's telling me
our anniversary?
but you interfered with the ring.
no. - Hey!
be there for him now like she always dreamed, and now
at an abandoned plant on the outside of town.
and speaking strictly as friends, and you never would have become me.
honey, I know that you don't like them,
you knew I'd be here?
Hey, I'm the one that put my feet under yours.
it is safer for you if you're in the shadows.
you decided to play dress-up, and it just stuck,
Yeah.
and stop punishing him for his past
it was John F Kennedy who once said,
thank you all for coming.
did you say our reunion?
a pick-me-up.
you showed up for five.
and they want to be vigilantes like him?
it's like she just vanished,
hardly news flash.
you've been on earth all this time,
he's always so Oliver.
I had intended to be here with you, but what you can do for your country.
no matter how much mud they sling.
crash-land your spaceship anywhere,
it would mean a lot to me,
Clark, you're from a different planet.
I should have known this would happen.
we've got a special treat for you.
gloat all you want,
people probably don't want to put hope their in someone weighing on your shoulders.
because we have to be on opposites sides of town
it's just that sometimes when you get pensive,
that's what I become?
you can't change his fate, Kal-El.
jonathan Kent, Sept 1, 1954-Jan 26, 2006
beloved husband and father
years?
there's Eddie from chem class.
I guess lately I've stopped believing then I'll molt...
I may not make the right decisions,
and just have this?
Lois...
wait -- - Seriously?
and it was the perfect day.
I know. We're late.
you protected my secret.
seems like he's gone away, "Ask not what your country can do for you,
what does that mean?
I'm from another time.
who needs no introduction
are you his plus-one?
Clark!
it's not every day a billionaire admits
my sincere apologies and has since vanished from society.
to remind you that if you were going to
good question.
Oliver Queen, if you really are
Yeah. What happened to her?
about the mysterious and the unexplained.
you're the one who writes about him.
that's too bad.
Really? Nothing?
I don't know if you're a ghost from my past
how many times have I told you that I
well, that's up to you, isn't it?
who's gonna let them down.
was it?
but at least I'm trying to save people.
or should I say the Green Arrow?
or the darkness that Jor-El warned me about, who dropped his shocking announcement
we can't trust him.
not that I'm an interior designer,
no, I mean any calls.
doesn't get any bigger than that.
what is going on with you today?
on a Daily Planet dress code.
Clark, I-I-I thought we agreed
just tell him.
a couple more hugs, or how I'm supposed to change it.
the legion.
okay, but that's why you've got me, okay?
in this world of armchair bloggers
I wanted you to see that your darkness
you were friends with Chloe Sullivan.
give me the ring. - Wait for the moment.
but those names are getting flipped
Lois, do you know where it is?
I mean, I was chewing gum at the time, but
Lois, wait. How did you get here?
why put off till tomorrow what you can do today?
but I swear it is not until
so what is it?
of course he'd sacrifice anything to protect me.
maybe it's a good thing he didn't show up for the reunion.
kryptonite again?
but then there was Lana.
Clark.
no, it isn't. It's the present.
and if you need me, I am there.
what did you say?
Yeah, but...
lies not only in dwelling upon the past,
I have a message for Clark Kent.
you never would have experienced all this,
you know what you need?
I'm here alone.
whoa, buddy.
you're damn right I'm a hero.
I'm with Clark Kent.
Oliver queen. - Oliver queen.
Clark?
smaller than the eye can see.
you were enrolled there for like
Superman saves the day
metropolis' infamous bad boy
well done, my man.
what's on your answering machine?
so, for that you want what,
I guess I should get going.
welcome back, everyone. Isn't this great?
a darkness has come to earth.
jonathan set his own destiny into motion.
I'm not worried about you.
goodbye, dad.
I went to school here, people.
because we have each other.
and the...flying.
Oh, now, don't leave early.
and I'm not so sure he'll be back.
I don't know what's gotten into you,
isn't that where you keep all your go-to phantom catchers
Thanks, Lois, but I don't think playing quarterback
don't you think it's time to face the public?
not again. Come on.
wait a minute.
wait a minute. I know you.
like you don't remember all of us behind the gym
Yes. Thank you.
which one of these has the punch in it,
my father's funeral.
Luthorcorp
cause you were me when you went through this, and I'm
it was -- it was romantic.
I'm not gonna stand here and do nothing.
tomorrow's our Smallville High reunion.
who only want what our grandparents wanted.
roof. Now.
we've lost control. We're going down.
to a fallen hero of this country?
right. Obviously.
right now.
Lois, I'm not supposed to be here.
so, who you here with?
I can't be two places at once.
you just said that we control our own fate.
I haven't seen her since...
she meant everything to me.
what else was I gonna do?
and raised in smallville! ... - In smallville.
I can't believe you're here!
I missed you.
I don't know if this is such a good idea.
right. Shut up.
I've came back to do the same for you.
going up. You're going down.
but if it ain't broke, honey, don't fix it.
it started out as a scrapbook
I lost someone.
wha
started right before the blur showed up in Metropolis?
maybe you're right, Jor-El.
Really?
whether it happens this day or any other day,
Mayday! Mayday!
no kidding.
I love you, too.
Adelia! Laney!
it's fine.
you couldn't have chosen better people to find you
Clark.
we need to table this all until later.
so...
you don't know what he's capable of.
Lois Lane. Chess club?
Why?
he's been lying to us all along!
but you were the one that decided you wanted to wear them,
seriously, was it just too boring
you spend so much time dwelling on the darkness
the ring, time travel -- all my creations.
Suzanne, actually.
correct me if I'm mistaken,
today, tomorrow.
maybe people deserve to know the truth.
leave Clark Kent to me.
please tell me it's not the black.
what are you doing?
I didn't realize you had a dark side, Clark.
they helped me destroy you.
and that was his choice.
amounts to some darkness within me.
and unlike you, I have to drive.
a merit badge and special rights?
and you saved me from all of that, Kal-El.
why wouldn't I?
Lois Lane.
the second the boys from OPS do a fly-by.
we'll see you all back here in another five years.
I need to know about the reunion.
I mean, she was the rising star at the Daily Planet,
and I-I don't think I'm the first rich boy
Sally "Pep Rally" Dickinson has put on a few.
it's like you've never been here before.
is that a joke, Clark?
the wall of weird has gone viral.
um, but I
we're waiting for some answers.
I mean, how many people in the world has he inspired?
we cannot have people thinking things.
we carry the torch with us every day
Lois, I don't really have a good feeling about all this.
you dated the Green Arrow, A. K.A. Oliver
the darkness is the past.
you don't need to worry about the future, Kal-El.
I can't keep the mayor waiting.
Mayday! Mayday!
you hold on to it. You dwell.
Clark, there's something that we need to talk about.
blue? Red?
late? Lois, I need to get back.
old flames.
um, thanks.
perhaps the defining moment
because that was a disaster. - Look, I just
but this will come to end, just like it did the last time.
well, you haven't changed a bit.
What'd you do to them? - I joined them.
busy day for a superhero.
no, Kal-El! You haven't learned the full lesson yet.
and I'm not doing it alone.
and this person, for one, is gonna stand by her hero
Yeah, I guess so.
she's not coming.
here. Hold this.
okay, crows, give it up or how does that work, exactly?
how about, "Don't leave your date with punch bowl maddie"?
even if we don't expect perfection from ourselves,
counselor's Office - Are you engaged? - Nope.
a hero is made in the moment,
I have a message for Clark Kent.
or looking ahead to what I can personally gain
I think I hear the veggie platter calling.
but in fearing the future.
I would do anything for you.
to bring peace to a brutal world.
look, the legion ring is the only way to do it.
looks like your bill is up,
nobody made that choice for you.
she sacrificed everything to protect me.
so you need to snap out of it.
of what happened in the past, you're missing the present
the woman that I, uh -- that I love...
you're quite a handful, Lois Lane.
Hey, Lois, let's, um, go inside.
that has a hometown hero like Clark Kent.
no. No, you're right. I'm not special.
I don't know how not returning his calls you're the moth, not the flame.
you can see that it's just fine...
I'm not dwelling on revenge for past atrocities
I know why you sent me here now.
it's just the guy from the 8th floor.
to get rid of the darkness of my past
then let me show you, Kal-El.
I brought the legion into a new realm of heroism.
has left you a pushpin short.
Yeah, three days ago. You feeling better?
it's great he's helping people. We can't all rise up
and you...
seems the Blur took a little vacation this week, too.
now, this is the homecoming I'm talking about.
you saved me the blisters, Smallville.
not every man is destined to find a woman like Lois.
Oh, don't play dumb. You always hold it over me.
I didn't know that he needed me.
so now you're -- you're comparing yourself
tower, this is November 0199.
we always have a choice, Kal-El.
Hey, Mark. Smokin' times, huh?
depends on the cheerleader.
you sent the person that I love away.
Oh, what's it like to date a real superhero?
I sat through an entire game once.
no deadline is more important than you, okay?
both intended to save civilizations,
I know they are not fashion-forward,
what happened to the bumbling nerd?
Susan Capra.
that we would keep our professional lives to ourselves,
so, this is all that's left of the torch?
putting up razor-wire fences to keep out immigrants
how long have you been seeing each other?
she's a handful, isn't she?
I love you.
I always thought he and Chloe were meant for each other.
a hug!
our anniversary?
neither of us are primed for "Dancing with the stars.
I mean, he would have stolen your thunder, Clark.
there's a lot of memories there for me.
like someone found out that she knew too much.
for the playboy turned green arrow, Oliver Queen,
we can withstand anything you bring down on us
I wanted to slow things down,
see? I told you.
we lost and we're falling.
if you're trying to make me feel guilty about something, but you care about Lois, don't you?
wait. I know what this is about.
he didn't think about what it would mean to the rest of us.
we can't always see it in ourselves.
what are you doing? - Lois, we need to talk.
seeing all those familiar faces.
Oh. Mark!
you wanted me to see how things would be with Lois
besides, what's the worst thing that could happen?
thank god you squeaked out that state championship
thank you.
are you sure he likes you?
I guess you're right.
Oh. Here you go.
I have the whole day mapped out for you.
you know, that first love -- you never get over it.
Clark Kent.
that's not exactly a news flash.
I'm sorry we missed our dance.
whatever you want with me, leave these people out of it.
we have a very special show for you this morning.
cnn, BBC, Dr. Phil?
um, sorry I've been kind of out of it lately.
but what kind of secret story got you to dress-up day?
hero haters.
how did I become so uptight... and nerdy?
I'm not sure how we're gonna make this work
Lois, huh?
is that it's great that the blur has been there
I think what Clark is trying to say
there must be something going around.
just remember that, Kal-El.
I've been so buried by the mistakes of my past
maybe I'm not the one.
you didn't miss anything in the news department.
and it is time for you to pay.
run a coffee shop in high school?
and I will. I won't ever forget.
guess I just haven't been back in a while.
maybe I shouldn't have brought you back here.
who wishes you could have at least thrown on the cape.
okay, I think your virtual weird wall
it was a way not to have to let go.
Oh...My...God.
then help Oliver be who he can be.
from a few tax breaks, drilling oil wells in the ocean,
the day you told me. The day you finally trusted me.
I've always hoped my life would be like this.
you always mixed us up.
I forgot again, didn't I?
as long as you shed the weight of the past.
I am the brain interactive construct.
there's no time to chat about how, where, and why.
you destroyed cities.
glad to see you're carrying my Torch--CS
look, we have a theory that the blur was born
who have created a generation of critics instead of leaders,
you'll be with me no matter where I go.
but one of these things doesn't exactly go with the other.
I'm sorry to disappoint you, but Chloe couldn't make it.
they had that whole "best friend with hope of more" thing.
I've been carrying around...
this isn't about who I am. It's about what I do.
well...I don't know.
you drive me crazy.
I kind of got caught up in my web of obsession.
I promise to be the man you knew I could be.
to be there for the people who need me now.
Oh, don't worry. I'm only here for you.
I wouldn't waste any more time on the blur.
you said to hold on to Smallville.
but there is a pilot with a raging migraine when he wakes up
we have lemonade and strawberry-ade.
you don't need to worry about me, Clark.
make sure you can soak in this special moment.
he never would... let us down.
why won't you forgive yourself?
time travel -- think it through.
we have an exclusive interview with a very special guest
you're afraid you'll never be the hero you want to be.
Lois, get over here.
no. They helped you cure me.
that's right in front of your eyes.
you will never be earth's savior.
Oliver made his own decision to come out to the public.
just as you've chosen to be the earth's protector.
in the 31st century, I'm known as brainiac 5.
fans and protestors alike are in an outcry
you just won't let yourself believe it.
that's the kind of guy he is.
you don't see it?
I mean, how gorgeous can you get, right?
I call it the wall of weird.
tell him thank you.
I think our audience would like some answers.
Oh, and Jake and the cupcake girl are together now.
this is my desk.
Lang.
but I have to say the one thing I never could.
nobody forced that on you, yet you embraced it.
and what's so special about this moment?
with your silence and your distance.
you tried to destroy Chloe. You tried to destroy the world.
because this was a defining moment for you
that farm boy next door turned local football hero
well, we're not, really...
it's one of the people I put away in high school.
okay, promise not to tell anyone?
yet still he made that choice every day he was with you.
we don't have the privilege of mistakes.
brainiac. I thought we destroyed you.
it was like I had a place, like I fit in.
something tells me it's for a good reason.
to parading around in leather, playing cops and robbers.
there is darkness in you and great power.
have I got something for you.
and self-admitted practicing vigilante, Oliver Queen.
your father didn't have to care for you the way he did.
Smallville is the closest thing to a past that this military brat has,
I forgot how many memories you have here.
this is the moment that your life changes forever.
and so worried about the responsibilities of the future,
why not? He saw the hero in all of us.
that's exactly what I have to do to move on...
it's time to move on from the past.
Clark is the reason a lot of us are still here.
she's definitely one of a kind.
don't strand me back in the dark ages.
for your alumni homecoming king -- Clark Kent!
because that's what you do when you believe in someone.
I chose to change fate. It was my fault that he died.
the day you started to blame yourself.
touch it once, shame on you. Touch it twice, shame on me.
without the jukebox, nostalgia, and the balloons and
for the city, for my country.
we don't have to be dating to show up at a reunion together.
we were both created in one way or another by Jor-El,
just when you think the world can't get more upside down, right?
the problem is, Kal-El, you and I aren't very different.
it -- it was really quick, just -- just a flash.
to be a role model for kids like you to look up to.
I'm sorry, sir. Mr. Kent hasn't left word.
with Lois and with all of it.
I won't let you destroy my family.
he chose to be your protector.
Kent, what are you doing?
and maybe you'll have the bah-humbugs squeezed out of you.
you can't, freak.
you punish yourself and everyone around you for past mistakes.
they always mention one person...
not for years, unless somebody's been seriously demoted.
that's okay. Who wants a dance anyway, right?
and, 3, 2, 1, action!
I'm actually doing something, right here, right now, "How do I get into college with a criminal record?
now, why don't you get
And...Okay, I-I always forget about it until the last minute,
if anybody understands deadlines and urgent...things,
I mean, you put the Smallville in Smallville, Smallville.
lane. Lane, Lane, Lane, Lane.
but I-I would date one again in a heartbeat.
looks like somebody took a bite out of Chloe's conspiracy cookie.
don't be late. Dinner reservations at 7: 00.
just the next time you decide to defy me,
my corruption started with a nanobyte
and -- and no -- no matter how crazy they are,
we all choose our own fate.
I never stopped blaming myself for what happened to you.
not from questioning the past or fearing what's to come.
your barn, when we were about to
but neither of us was immune to corruption...
that's what will always separate the Kents from the Luthors.
for interrupting this festive trip down memory Lane.
wait! So, you're not hitched to Clark?
just for now, can we leave tomorrow till tomorrow.
so nice of you to come back to the reunion, save me a trip.
a darkness has come to earth.
this isn't your fight.
I'm not gonna stand here and do nothing.
you've been on earth all this time, and you can't even fly?
the woman that I, uh -- that I love...
she sacrificed everything to protect me.
first I'll eat...
then I'll molt...
then I'll mate.
I am the Brain Interactive Construct.
do not underestimate me.
it is safer for you if you're in the shadows.
it's safer for all the heroes.
maybe people deserve to know the truth.
I am Green Arrow.
there is darkness in you and great power.
you're afraid you'll never be the hero you want to be.
you will never be earth's savior.
good question.
maybe you're right, Jor-El.
maybe I'm not the one.
maybe none of us are.
um, sorry I've been kind of out of it lately.
I left you a message.
Yeah, three days ago.
you feeling better?
well, no worries.
you didn't miss anything in the news department.
okay.
seems The Blur took a little vacation this week, too.
there must be something going around.
hero haters.
just when you think the world can't get more upside down, right?
people probably don't want to put hope their in someone who's gonna let them down.
he never would...
let us down.
the Blur, I mean.
and this person, for one, is gonna stand by her hero no matter how much mud they sling.
Why?
because that's what you do when you believe in someone.
you know what you need?
a pick-me-up.
Thanks, Lois, but I don't think playing quarterback is gonna make my day.
depends on the cheerleader.
come on. Did you forget?
tomorrow's our Smallville high reunion.
did you say our reunion? - Yes.
you were enrolled there for like -- 23 days.
you showed up for five.
that's a record in my book.
Smallville is the closest thing to a past that this military brat has, and I am not gonna miss it.
we don't have to be dating to show up at a reunion together.
there's a lot of memories there for me.
come on, Clark.
it would mean a lot to me, seeing all those familiar faces.
it was like I had a place, like I fit in.
and you...
I mean, you put the Smallville in Smallville, Smallville.
besides, what's the worst thing that could happen?
I've wasted a decade picking up the pieces from meteor mutant students.
how do I get into college with a criminal record?
you can't, freak.
you see, I have spent years hearing their stories.
and -- and no -- no matter how crazy they are, they always mention one person...
you.
so nice of you to come back to the reunion, save me a trip.
looks like your bill is up, and it is time for you to pay.
it's time to move on from the past.
leave Clark Kent to me.
guess I just haven't been back in a while.
there's Eddie from chem class.
Oh, and Jake and the cupcake girl are together now.
Sally "pep rally" Dickinson has put on a few.
Lois, I don't really have a good feeling about all this.
Nietzsche?
I didn't realize you had a dark side, Clark.
doesn't everybody?
Yeah, I guess so.
so, what are you, man or superman?
well, look who it is.
have I got something for you.
a hug!
um, thanks.
Oh, now, don't leave early.
we've got a special treat for you.
a couple more hugs, and maybe you'll have the bah-humbugs squeezed out of you.
welcome back, everyone.
isn't this great?
I have the whole day mapped out for you.
chess Club?
I sat through an entire game once.
Hey, Mark.
smokin' times, huh?
should I know you?
like you don't remember all of us behind the gym on a smoke break.
I mean, I was chewing gum at the time, but -- really?
nothing?
Hey, Lois, let's, um, go inside.
I can't believe you're here!
what happened to the bumbling nerd?
Suzanne, actually.
you always mixed us up.
well, you haven't changed a bit.
Bak-bak, crow.
here you go.
thank you.
are you his plus-one?
I went to school here, people.
old flames.
I should have known this would happen.
I haven't seen her since...
your barn, when we were about to
she's not coming.
I forgot how many memories you have here.
it started out as a scrapbook and just kind of mutated.
what is it?
I call it the Wall of Weird.
so, what do you think?
I'm sorry.
maybe I shouldn't have brought you back here.
o My...god
you were friends with Chloe Sullivan.
Yeah.
what happened to her?
I mean, she was the rising star at The Daily Planet, like she always dreamed, and now
it's like she just vanished, like someone found out that she knew too much.
looks like somebody took a bite out of Chloe's conspiracy cookie.
I'm sorry to disappoint you, but Chloe couldn't make it.
wait a minute.
I know you.
you're Lois Lane.
Yes. Thank you.
you dated the Green Arrow, A.K. A.Oliver -- Oliver Queen. - Oliver Queen.
Oh, what's it like to date a real superhero?
it -- it was really quick, just -- just a flash.
but I-I would date one again in a heartbeat.
so, this is all that's left of the Torch?
are you kidding?
we carry the Torch with us every day
everything you need to know about the mysterious and the unexplained.
the Wall of Weird has gone viral.
the Blur.
what?
okay, promise not to tell anyone?
look, we have a theory that The Blur was born -- and raised in Smallville!...- In Smallville.
okay, I think your virtual weird wall has left you a pushpin short.
you're the one who writes about him.
you seriously never considered that all of these miraculous saves that - Chloe wrote about in the Torch started right before The Blur showed up in Metropolis? - yeah
I wouldn't waste any more time on The Blur.
seems like he's gone away, and I'm not so sure he'll be back.
I think what Clark is trying to say is that it's great that
the Blur has been there to be a role model for kids like you to look up to.
I mean, how many people in the world has he inspired?
exactly.
maybe it's a good thing he didn't show up for the reunion.
I mean, he would have stolen your thunder, Clark.
what thunder?
okay, crows, give it up for your alumni Homecoming King -- Clark Kent!
now, this is the homecoming I'm talking about.
thank God you squeaked out that state championship in your senior year.
my sincere apologies for interrupting this festive trip down memory lane.
I thought we destroyed you.
whatever you want with me, leave these people out of it.
Oh, don't worry.
I'm only here for you.
I wanted to slow things down, make sure you can soak in this special moment.
and what's so special about this moment?
this is the moment that your life changes forever.
I don't know if you're a ghost from my past or the darkness that Jor-El warned me about, but this will come to end, just like it did the last time.
I hope so, for your sake.
my sake?
you sent the person that I love away.
you tried to destroy Chloe.
you tried to destroy the World.
and you saved me from all of that, Kal-El.
I've came back to do the same for you.
the Legion.
you're from the future.
What'd you do to them?
I joined them.
in the 31st century, I'm known as Brainiac 5.
the ring, time travel -- all my creations.
I brought The Legion into a new realm of heroism.
they helped me destroy you.
no.
they helped you cure me.
the problem is, Kal-El, you and I aren't very different.
we were both created in one way or another by Jor-El, both intended to save civilizations, to bring peace to a brutal world.
but neither of us was immune to corruption...
to darkness.
what does that mean?
all of a sudden everyone's telling me that I have a darkness within me, but I don't understand what it is or how I'm supposed to change it.
you destroyed cities.
I may not make the right decisions, but at least I'm trying to save people.
then let me show you, Kal-El.
we can't always see it in ourselves.
my corruption started with a nanobyte -- smaller than the eye can see.
but that's all it took.
my father's funeral.
if you're trying to save me somehow, why show me this?
because this was a defining moment for you -- perhaps the defining moment -
the day you started to blame yourself.
why wouldn't I?
I chose to change fate. It was my fault that he died.
was it?
dad?
I won't let you destroy my family.
we can withstand anything you bring down on us because we have each other.
that's what will always separate the Kents from the Luthors.
now, why don't you get -- you can't change his fate, Kal-El.
he was just protecting me.
and that was his choice.
whether it happens this day or any other day, Jonathan set his own destiny into motion.
you know that.
you just won't let yourself believe it.
why won't you forgive yourself?
he didn't have a choice.
he's my father.
of course he'd sacrifice anything to protect me.
we always have a choice, Kal-El.
your father didn't have to care for you the way he did.
yet still he made that choice every day he was with you.
he chose to be your protector.
just as you've chosen to be the Earth's protector.
nobody forced that on you, yet you embraced it.
nobody made that choice for you.
we all choose our own fate.
fans and protesters alike are in an outcry for the playboy turned Green Arrow, Oliver Queen, who dropped his shocking announcement and has since vanished from society.
I got kids.
what happens when they grow up and they want to be vigilantes like him?
it's great he's helping people.
we can't all rise up -- this isn't a memory.
no, it isn't.
it's the present.
he's been lying to us all along!
we can't trust him.
if you're trying to make me feel guilty about something, you just said that we control our own fate.
Oliver made his own decision to come out to the public.
he didn't think about what it would mean to the rest of us.
Oliver Queen, if you really are the hero that you say you are, don't you think it's time to face the public?
we're waiting for some answers.
any calls?
where do you want to start?
cnn, BBC, Dr. Phil?
no, I mean any calls.
Oh, um...
I'm sorry, sir.
mr Kent hasn't left word.
he's always so Oliver. I didn't know that he needed me.
but he does.
I don't know how not returning his calls amounts to some darkness within me.
you don't see it?
the darkness is the past.
you hold on to it. You dwell.
you punish yourself and everyone around you for past mistakes.
we don't have the privilege of mistakes.
even if we don't expect perfection from ourselves, the rest of the world does.
you heard what they said.
then help Oliver be who he can be.
today, tomorrow.
be there for him now and stop punishing him for his past with your silence and your distance.
let it go.
which one of these has the punch in it, if you know what I mean?
I'm sorry?
we have lemonade and strawberry-ade.
Yeah, but...
strawberry-ade.
so, who you here with?
I'm an alum.
I'm with Clark Kent.
Really?
Oh, I just always thought Clark was so dreamy, you know?
that farm boy next door turned local football hero -- doesn't get any bigger than that.
funny -- I always thought he and Chloe were meant for each other.
they had that whole "best friend with hope of more" thing.
Chloe's my cousin.
Yeah.
but then there was Lana.
I mean, how gorgeous can you get, right?
and hardworking.
I mean, how many cheerleaders run a coffee shop in high school?
Lana and Clark were perfect.
you know, that first love -- you never get over it.
I think I hear the veggie platter calling.
wait! So, you're not hitched to Clark?
not exactly.
are you engaged?
Nope.
how long have you been seeing each other?
well, we're not, really...
right now.
so...
you're the moth, not the flame.
are you sure he likes you?
correct me if I'm mistaken, but you care about Lois, don't you?
all I've ever done was protect her after what happened with Lana.
interesting outcome.
Lois doesn't seem especially protected.
you spend so much time dwelling on the darkness of what happened in the past, you're missing the present that's right in front of your eyes.
it's one of the people I put away in high school.
you don't know what he's capable of.
I need to get back.
to do what? Weren't you about to hang up your shield?
I have a message for Clark Kent.
give me the ring.
wait for the moment.
no, Kal-El! - You haven't learned the full lesson yet.
whoa, buddy.
watch it! - Lois.
how -- not again.
come on.
wha-- Wait -- seriously?
I know we agreed that we would keep our professional lives to ourselves, but what kind of secret story got you to dress-up day?
here.
hold this.
honey, I know that you don't like them, but you were the one that decided you wanted to wear them, and lucky for you, I have a spare.
no. - hey
I know they are not fashion-forward, but if it ain't broke, honey, don't fix it.
Seriously?
Clark, I-I-I thought we agreed on a Daily Planet dress code.
Lois, wait. How did you get here?
I need to know about the reunion.
we need to table this all until later.
we cannot have people thinking things.
Perry? What the hell?
how many times have I told you that I -- I told you it's not him.
it's just the guy from the 8th floor.
Kent, what are you doing?
this is my desk.
not for years, unless somebody's been seriously demoted.
years?
what are you doing?
Lois, we need to talk.
gloat all you want, but those names are getting flipped the second the boys from ops do a fly-by.
what is going on with you today?
it's like you've never been here before.
I haven't, Lois.
I'm from another time.
no kidding. Clark, you're from a different planet.
that's not exactly a news flash.
what did you say?
I didn't mean to come off so Lois.
it's just that sometimes when you get pensive,
I know that it's because you have the whole "last son of Krypton" thing weighing on your shoulders.
okay, but that's why you've got me, okay?
to remind you that if you were going to crash-land your spaceship anywhere, you couldn't have chosen better people to find you than the Kents.
so you need to snap out of it.
wait.
I know what this is about.
I forgot again, didn't I?
our anniversary?
our anniversary?
Oh, don't play dumb.
you always hold it over me.
the day you told me.
the day you finally trusted me.
it was -- it was romantic.
and it was the perfect day.
and...
okay, I-I always forget about it until the last minute, but I swear it is not until -- see?
I told you.
so what is it?
wait a minute.
Oh, no.
kryptonite again?
look, I -- Blue?
red?
not green?
please tell me it's not the black.
because that was a disaster.
look, I just -- I need the Legion ring.
Lois, do you know where it is?
is that a joke, Clark?
touch it once, shame on you.
touch it twice, shame on me.
and actually...
I could really use it right now, because we have to be on opposites sides of town in 10 minutes.
and unlike you, I have to drive.
I can't keep the mayor waiting.
Lois, I'm not supposed to be here.
I know. We're late.
late? Lois, I need to get back.
look, the legion ring is the only way to do it.
back?
okay, listen, why don't you check your trunk of tchotchkes at the farm?
isn't that where you keep all your go-to phantom catchers and fortress disks and stuff?
and if you need me, I am there.
no deadline is more important than you, okay?
going up. You're going down.
she's a handful, isn't she?
you're right on time.
you knew I'd be here?
time travel -- think it through.
cause you were me when you went through this, and I'm -- well done, my man.
how did I become so uptight...
and nerdy?
there's no time to chat about how, where, and why.
we've been through weirder things.
I need you on the roof.
when did I start taking orders?
there's a nuclear reactor about to blow at an abandoned plant on the outside of town.
now, I can't be two places at once.
if you knew it was gonna happen, they why didn't you stop it?
you never would have experienced all this, and you never would have become me.
that's too bad.
roof.
now.
that's what I become?
Mayday!
Mayday!
we've lost control.
we're going down.
Mayday! Mayday!
what are you doing?
I don't know what's gotten into you, but there is a pilot with a raging migraine when he wakes up who wishes you could have at least thrown on the cape.
you protected my secret.
what else was I gonna do?
I would do anything for you.
hardly news flash.
thank you.
you drive me crazy.
I guess I should get going.
right. Obviously.
busy day for a superhero.
don't be late.
dinner reservations at 7: 00.
not every man is destined to find a woman like Lois.
she's definitely one of a kind.
I know why you sent me here now.
I had intended to be here with you, but you interfered with the ring.
you wanted me to see how things would be with Lois and the...
flying.
I wanted you to see that your darkness lies not only in dwelling upon the past, but in fearing the future.
I've always hoped my life would be like this.
with Lois and with all of it.
I guess lately I've stopped believing that it could actually happen.
well, that's up to you, isn't it?
you don't need to worry about the future, Kal-El.
you can see that it's just fine...
as long as you shed the weight of the past.
just the next time you decide to defy me, don't strand me back in the dark ages.
I have a message for Clark Kent.
yeah?
how about,"don't leave your date with punch bowl Maddie"?
something tells me it's for a good reason.
Clark is the reason a lot of us are still here.
Oh?
I kind of got caught up in my web of obsession.
he set me straight.
it's not every place that has a hometown hero like Clark Kent.
that's the kind of guy he is.
just tell him.
tell him thank you.
I guess you're right.
I've been so buried by the mistakes of my past and so worried about the responsibilities of the future, I lost sight of the present.
a hero is made in the moment, not from questioning the past or fearing what's to come.
just remember that, Kal-El.
thank you all for coming.
we'll see you all back here in another five years.
Bak-bak, crows!
I'm sorry.
that's okay.
who wants a dance anyway, right?
you saved me the blisters, Smallville.
besides, you know what?
I have an early deadline tomorrow.
why put off till tomorrow what you can do today?
you're quite a handful, Lois Lane.
look who's talking.
you were right, dad.
I never stopped blaming myself for what happened to you.
it was a way not to have to let go.
that's exactly what I have to do to move on...
to get rid of the darkness of my past I've been carrying around...
to be there for the people who need me now.
you said to hold on to Smallville.
and I will. I won't ever forget.
you'll be with me no matter where I go.
but I have to say the one thing I never could.
goodbye, dad.
I promise to be the man you knew I could be.
and three，
two，
action...
good morning, Metropolis.
we have a very special show for you this morning.
we have an exclusive interview with a very special guest who needs no introduction -
metropolis' infamous bad boy and self-admitted practicing vigilante, Oliver Queen.
or should I say the Green Arrow?
what's on your answering machine?
it's...
it's not every day a billionaire admits to parading around in leather, playing cops and robbers.
why do it?
seriously, was it just too boring sitting around counting your money?
you decided to play dress-up, and it just stuck, or how does that work, exactly?
I think our audience would like some answers.
I lost someone.
she meant everything to me.
so, for that you want what, a merit badge and special rights?
no.
no, you're right. I'm not special.
this isn't about who I am.
it's about what I do.
and I-I don't think I'm the first rich boy who felt that way.
it was John F. Kennedy who once said,"ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.
so now you're -- you're comparing yourself to a fallen hero of this country?
why not?
he saw the hero in all of us.
I'm not dwelling on revenge for past atrocities or looking ahead to what I can personally gain from a few tax breaks, drilling oil wells in the ocean, putting up razor-wire fences to keep out immigrants who only want what our grandparents wanted.
in this world of armchair bloggers who have created a generation of critics instead of leaders, I'm actually doing something, right here, right now, for the city, for my country.
and I'm not doing it alone.
you're damn right I'm a hero.
glad to see you're carrying my Torch--CS
not that I'm an interior designer, but one of these things doesn't exactly go with the other.
I'm sorry we missed our dance.
you don't need to worry about me, Clark.
if anybody understands deadlines and urgent...
things, it's me.
I'm not worried about you.
I missed you.
I don't know.
neither of us are primed for "Dancing With The Stars.
and speaking strictly as friends, I don't know if this is such a good idea.
Lois, get over here.
I'm not sure how we're gonna make this work without the jukebox, nostalgia, and the balloons and -- Lois...
shut up?
right. Shut up.
sorry.
Hey, I'm the one that put my feet under yours.
um, but I -- it's fine.
let's just try this.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Clark, there's something that we need to talk about.
just for now, can we leave tomorrow till tomorrow and just have this?
assassinate Hero Target In Smallville
Yeah.
Clark should see this.
daddy.
Lois
Lucy.
assassinate Hero Target In Smallville
Lois...
none of my other boyfriends through our rules,
so...
fine?
I see.
Clark?
I don't.
I'll be fine.
it's a funny thing
Yeah.
come on.
well, that depends.
ambushed you.
now.
Really?
excuse me, sir,
Yeah.
if it wasn't for her,
you got to go.
it's over here.
uh, no, sweetheart.
nothing.
wait a second. Wait a second.
who would've known fire insurance
you don't have to be nervous, Lois.
I know this guy.
back off, Lucy.
and when the vigilantes
it is in her name, but I
without a fight.
and be killed.
there's nothing to worry about.
let's not forget the Talon
I promise.
now, a couple calls to the NSA,
I thought it would be a good idea
watchtower, I mean.
they're a hell of a team.
I got to admit,
I appreciate her help,
which is a bit surprising,
it's a homing device.
what I am trying to say is inspecting the enemy camp.
talk to me.
make yourself at home, daddy.
the troublemaker?
just couldn't do -- not even us.
no.
she's in her costume.
take off your shirt.
without Clark.
I politely declined.
we don't need a history lesson.
lo, can we talk?
I can be friendly.
he's gonna go down with them.
you do the same thing that he does
who are you?
I love your daughter,
Thanks.
well, you know what?
Lois...
were you gonna say a father?
they have to enlist,
target is on the move.
look, Lucy...
remind him what a real hero is.
I do not want you near him.
for full disclosure.
Oh, I think he's more interested in doing recon
you're their hero.
and we'll find out what he's hiding.
so far, no one's passed.
have ever survived the general's assault.
it's just me.
don't you see?
or do you happen to have some compromising photos of me
before we were a couple, Clark.
I can't do that, Lo. - Why?
well, at least show me around the barn.
Lois, not so tight.
do you have proof?
thank you, sweetheart.
incoming: Oliver Queen
I'll be right there.
and then when it comes to your father,
flag would try to recruit you
okay.
Friendly...I can do that.
both of you!
you have been questioning me all day.
vigilante Registration Act passes, you'd like to share with the class?
I didn't think you'd actually move in.
you're not kidding.
it's general Sam Lane.
no, sir I...uh.
flag's planning on killing someone,
Yeah, let me tell you something, Tess.
but right now, he's in serious danger.
violence isn't the answer.
what happened to being a gentleman, hmm?
and dodging the press,
general Lane survived.
it may be your right!
sir, yes, sir.
you know what?
considering your impermeable skin.
that's a hell of a name.
your dad just wants to spend time with you.
america will do the right thing.
give this to your father.
and it's important to me that you are happy.
what if someone sees me come in here?
I work side-by-side with Lois.
no, I never do...
the suicide squad, huh?
a what, Lois?
you know, when I said you could move in,
checking the chimney.
Clark, if you want to be with me,
this is the signal for the suicide squad.
Hey, just because you don't have a
the men and women of our armed forces.
excuse me.
on the man dating his daughter.
is that you couldn't stand up to your dad.
general?
you're a great sister.
your sister's still upstairs unpacking.
america's turning against us.
since my wife passed away.
and Lucy.
damn it.
but...
because one of them superfreaks did it.
come on, let's go.
we wouldn't even be on Flag's trail.
that are gonna have to be brought up to code.
it's a classy move, attacking your own country.
but you can't contain her hot lips?
they're gonna be on your doorstep soon,
Lucy...
that's just how sweet he is.
Clark.
Lois!
you can put out a burning building,and answer is standing right in front of you.
he's heading for the Kent farm.
he just gives me the byline sometimes.
flag's tracking me, too?
before he'd try and kill you, Clark.
I thought you could use the refreshment.
and they commit acts of terrorism.
blown to kingdom come.
she surprised me.
I'm not so set in my ways
u. S. senator, hmm?
was "frenemy."
Lucy.
so what? You thought I would catch you two tongue-wrestling
there's really not much to see.
go through background checks, training,
have a seat, son.
the vigilante registration act.
that will change your mind on the bill?
I've had a look around, and there's a few things
Uh-huh.
and for your father's protection,
there's ice in the freezer.
they were out of cranberries.
that's a subdermal tattoo.
there's about to be a new law
I don't even know what that means.
we've, uh...
went upstairs.
to see that we are just trying to protect you?
Lois, your sister just...
and then he wanted to kiss and make up.
so please do not make me choose sides.
I'll replace everything you lost, Lois.
I owe you an apology.
didn't cover mortar fire?
daddy. - General Lane.
I needed to hear that.
scratched the surface.
not all of your vigilantes are bad.
be held accountability for their actions.
and firefighters are rapidly losing ground against the blaze.
they were led by Rick Flag.
that you turned into the troublemaker,
daddy, let's go.
it wasn't your fault.
everything you need to know about him
just tell him you found it on the farm.
you're where?
we're all gonna get to have ourselves
daddy, uh, Clark and I work together a lot.
you -- come with me.
please.
please, dad, go back and talk to him.
just like your vigilante witch hunt.
you can count on me.
to him, you're all freedom fighters,
fine won't pass inspection.
you make your choices based on fear.
when he finally pays the price for this,
your mother still own the place?
when I was working for Amanda Waller at Checkmate,
I know a smokescreen when I see one.
good.
he's helping agitators who would like nothing more
you're in league with them, aren't you?
but this means something to the general,
I took care of it. Look, your dad's met me before.
why do you have to go to defcon 1?
and you work in a basement. Is that correct?
your skin is reacting to the iodine.
baked or mashed?
there's only one tatto hero in that address.
again.
to test Lois?
there's nothing to work out.
Oliver, I'm trying to help you,
I can work with that.
so come on, now. Let's go.
it's over, Flag. We know you blew up that building.
so, what are you in the mood for?
not to test them.
the vigilante registration act.
Oh, I'm in the mood.
he'd stop seeing me as...
the only thing that matters is how I feel.
what, the window? What are we, 16?
Chloe would have had this finished, like, yesterday.
we look after each other. - Good.
but I draw the line at happy hour.
so is your father.
that wouldn't really be fair to them, would it?
who wouldn't want to do that?
how did you say you hurts yourself again?
Hey，daddy, since we are pretending this is a holiday,
we've come a long way.
pretty soon the superheroes form cells,
Oliver, I've seen this before.
so, I was curious. You, uh...
I'm sorry if I startled you.
if he tagged you, he's tracking you.
I have Emil looking into it.
there were certain dirty jobs that a government agent
Lois, you either agree with him or you don't.
it's Clark -- you know him.
your girls love you, sir.
so, Lois being saved by a vigilante...
he must've used blue Kryptonite.
Lois, can you stop running damage control long enough
I have to believe that when push comes to shove,
you have to be perfect.
that's number 17 on the list.
going to war,
by the grace of god,
men who make the news.
and the rockets' red glare,
but...
it's my right to protect my family!
the bedroom's upstairs.
could you also plant this on him?
we wouldn't know about these tattoos.
I think we were so busy
I hope you can respect that.
who run around inciting anarchy.
start taking the law into their own hands.
you haven't met a single one of them.
Lois, I... - Just save it.
I ran into someone who literally had an ax to grind.
the general give you a list?
so, hopefully someone's monogrammed jacket has vanished in a blur.
was deal with my dad for one day.
but as soon as you're threatened,
that's an order, young lady.
I'm the senior military adviser on a new bill
but if I remember correctly, and then, what, have a big fight with Clark?
and not all politicians have yours.
I dealt with my family,
we're not gonna let that happen.
He...went upstairs.
look, I come here, and I think of Chloe, all right?
Clark...
I think of all the time that I spent here with her,
I'm posted nearby at Fort Ryan.
well, it is the bullpen at the Daily Planet.
go.
I'm the target.
let's get down to brass tacks.
and you keep acting like I'm the enemy.
I was beginning to think the best that I could do
we forgot how to be sisters.
it'll help us track and protect him.
now everyone wants to stick theirs in my business than to see your father fail at his current mission.
something's happening beneath the surface.
looks like you had a rough night.
he's recruiting a whole new squad.
from the middle of the ocean to the top of the city.
about Green Arrow showing his face to everyone.
Where's Clark?
try and take over this country with anarchy,
I should have told you what was going on.
I think your sister planted them in the loft.
you know, when you need first aid,
if you kill Lane, you kill a movement.
look at this
Thanks.
Yeah, I'm afraid so.
I think it's a little early for "friend.
and I just
and by "vigilante" you mean...
it made coming home
I think we need some veggies with our starches.
it doesn't make any sense.
can I give you some advice, Clark?
I'd spend more time with the family.
to profile, hunt, and destroy us.
and you were right.
you want to protect the United States,
right on schedule.
I intercepted a suicide squad transmission.
I helped the blur, I even found my inner iron chef, make them choose us as their leaders.
I have not always been a perfect father.
the general is leaving the farm, sir.
and Waller would send in the squad.
Lois, what do you think?
he'll know what to do.
Ah, that's a good cup of coffee.
it is important to me that my dad likes you.
it's hard for me being here with someone else, okay?
stop the menace!
where were they, honey, under the hood?
leave you holding the bags?
I can do this whole 9: 00-to-5: 00 thing with you, all right?
well, I don't think they incite anarchy.
holding you up as a volunteer.
wait. Flag survived?
are you questioning my relationship with my daughter?
I kind of like her having her own private guardian angel.
but it's the right one.
why don't you ask her, sir?
nobody's record's that clean.
but what gives you the right to spy on us?
it's good to see you, sir.
you expect it to be in the first place you look.
everyone else's rights go out the window?
your dad had me investigated by the pentagon.
I appreciate that you like straight talk,
vigilantes -- weekend warriors in masks an impossible list of chores to do.
it doesn't matter! Because I love Clark.
I am sorry, Clark.
new chairs, you got a whole new set-up going on.
violence is the only answer.
we need to get him off of that farm and away from Clark Kent.
but, you know, it's funny.
trust me, Clark is not who you think he is.
you know, this place is sort of like an island, isn't it?
I did everything I could to make today work.
always watch your six, Ms. Lane.
okay.
and I'm not trying to take her place, Oliver.
can you form a sentence without lying to my face?
that's a declaration of war.
my dad hates superheroes.
update on the refinery blaze.
you're searching for enemies where they don't exist.
how can you be sure?
and all I asked -- the only thing you had to do
I'm sorry. I'm, uh...
we interrupt this scheduled program for breaking news.
if the bill passes, it already has!
leave it to the Blur to turn a fire into a photo op.
God bless America.
about Lois and I...
I thought you said no happy hour.
it's best if he not know that you got this from me.
Tess and I think we're practically like family at this point.
but she's running around there like she owns the building.
a home-cooked Thanksgiving meal.
its biggest supporter is in Smallville right now.
with superpowered people that he identifies with them.
no evidence of explosives. You want to know why?
well, I hope you enjoyed today,
I was talking about you, Clark.
well, I'm a four-star general, Clark, and a war hero.
and the struggle to save lives,
found the cranberries. They were in the...truck.
I'm not on trial, Sam.
we've survived tax audits and typhoons together,
he has surveillance photos of me with Kara.
I'll take it.
he's hiding something.
Clark...
get me a work-up on Clark Kent
still...
so, go make yourself useful and get us some ice.
somewhere between chasing the bad guy
she could be all day.
well, it sounds really exhausting.
Colonel Richard Stafford.
those poor bastards, I put them through hell.
the blur saved your life.
your friend Clark is a dishonest man.
now, nobody could have done this list by themselves.
you'll only be stirring up anti-hero hysteria.
but we need to decode this before he does.
and he would attack anyone that threatens that
missile is locked on target, sir.
but you know what's a bigger surprise
I'll meet you in the car, daddy.
I knew he got under my skin, but come on.
you live in your mother's house.
but at some point,
go make your father proud.
like scrubbing the bathroom tile with a toothbrush?
I'm just trying to get used to all the changes around here, okay?
like I haven't seen it all before.
Lois, I need to go chop some wood!
no, Lois.
that must be a really hard decision to make.
something tells me I'm not the only one.
Lois likes to date men of action
I think I've earned a 10-minute break.
but I think Lois has got herself a brand-new hero now.
the fire is out, thanks to the Blur.
thanks to his influence with a number of senators,
guess what he came up with.
if we all went to your place tonight,
you've become the politicians' poster boy
she seems to write more articles than you.
having to deal with the rush of battle
though I feel a little uncomfortable
list was completed and accounted for, sir.
Yeah, I...
you will respect that.
did I hear you talking to someone up here, Clark?
you're gonna have to deal with my family, too.
for years, I've been giving her boyfriends
Yeah, but I'm still on the clock, so...
because I was finally able to be the good one.
like the R. A.O. Tower in Metropolis,
nobody's had the guts to talk to me like that
Yeah, Tess is working on that back at Watchtower, which...
he's convinced they all have something to hide.
no need to worry, my friend.
there's a question I was hoping to ask you.
but they all died when Checkmate was attacked.
well, this has Lucy written all over it...
no, I will not let them compromise our national security.
it's no wonder Lois is too afraid to be herself around you.
Oliver, we have to figure out why he's tracking us.
so I will give it to you in one razor-sharp line.
why not just deliver it to him yourself?
that's exactly what I was afraid of.
I am just trying to get through this holiday
get all the other heroes to stand up to be counted...
but I bet he can't outrun this.
because if Lois is gonna be spending any time around here,
Lois never said a thing.
target closing in on farmhouse.
a fire has broken out at a refinery in Smallville, and doing the simple things difficult.
you must really miss her.
that sounds like some serious overtime.
this guy tied me to a chair, he beat me to a pulp,
your cure-all was two raw eggs in a belgian beer, hmm?
hear anything about that tattoo-removal research?
I thought you were somebody who stood up for what she believed in.
just not for breakfast.
after everything you've told me about Chloe
unless you actually agree with this vigilante registration thing?
they count on that for their safety.
some will use the law to destroy people.
I'll be the first.
and that's all thanks to the blur, hmm?
whether he knows it or not,
except maybe if he finds out that you're a superhero.
our "eyes on the ground" report target is in Smallville, sir.
I can't believe that I almost got you killed.
but...
Kent is a vigilante sympathizer.
unless they had somebody higher up wipe it out.
you need to start treating me like I am on your side.
good, cause I only brought one lemonade.
every day.
that make us human.
it's not a good time.
he likes to test Lois' boyfriends.
somebody, let's say, like a...
gave proof through the night
I did it for my country.
shock and awful" missile makeover.
watchtower's in good hands, Tess.
now, you, Clark, you just report the news.
...in backstabbing bitch-berry lip gloss.
Lucy found this in your loft.
nothing much has changed around here.
I almost lost her tonight.
well, if anyone can do it, I'm sure you can.
that's how I knew she didn't love them.
I'm sorry... about what happened with Lucy.
we don't want to arouse Kent's suspicions.
and more and more superheroes are coming over to my side.
Clark, do you know who the real heroes of the world are?
and I don't want a day to go by where I'm not with her.
our larger-than-life hero needing someone to protect him?
I don't understand.
people start believing in these so-called superheroes, because it's the last day you'll ever spend with her.
what say we make it official and take a furlough from work?
your mother is my major opposition in the senate.
and... Peek in my window and...
it's just too bad I got to vote myself off.
what exactly do you do with your time, Clark?
and what this place means to you...
the whole Lane family's together for the holidays.
it's just your typical ax-wielding maniac.
why could she be possibly interested in you?
presidents, senators, the military, it doesn't matter.
just like you're gonna make Clark and I trust you again?
the store must've had a fire sale, huh, Clark?
the blur may be faster than a speeding bullet...
I'm a military man, Clark.
we hit the building but not the target.
it's the simple things like taking a walk that our flag was still there.
but I think that part of me sort of liked the fact
all you have to answer to is yourself.
because he's in league with masked vigilantes.
I'm not happy that you went behind our backs...
that's a very serious accusation.
the bombs bursting in air,
Oh. Does this mean you're finally running for office, daddy?
which means Clark Kent won't be able to blur to his rescue.
now, don't get me wrong. I've loved serving our country.
Yeah. He was upstairs... outside.
happy Turkey Day, sister. Great!
why would you bring up vigilantes?
that registration act is nothing but a weapon
I thought you said that Clark...
but the porch swing -- it's out there.
kind of like Lois did the right thing by you tonight.
is that you haven't had to deal with a family for a really long time.
I'm surprised a general's daughter would leave herself open to attack.
and he has dangerous friends.
now, the only reason that I am keeping you around is for dad.
I'm here because we think you can help us.
your father is crucial to congress passing anti-vigilante legislation.
okay, I know I came down on you pretty hard, Lu.
I even got to be a hero a couple times.
there are people who count on this place remaining secret.
no more hiding in the shadows.
I do get trying to protect dad.
chop and stack one cord of wood.
whatever the general would like, of course.
that I can't appreciate the way you stood up to me earlier.
trying to be the perfect daughter that...
or dancing with your wife, tucking in the kids
but you're wrong to think that we don't belong together.
they didn't step out into the limelight like I did.
I'm staying with Clark, and if you love me...
the U. S. army is depending on you, Lucy.
we have got to fight back, show strength,
you've grown into quite a man in the past six years, Clark.
when you say it all out loud, it's just...
but I thought that if I helped dad on my own,
not every hero has the blur's code of honor.
from who?
karma Jar.
Lionel?
no.
Clark.
I'm not your son.
get in here.
wait.
Tess, I found it.
our father?
the Blur Saves Under Scrutiny
stay away from me, Clark.
nighty night!
seriously.
he found us.
Lois, I'm happy to see you.
it just showed up.
damn it.
stop.
my son.
okay.
you're a Luthor.
is this a dream?
ruin everything.
we can work this out.
your scar.
you're nothing but trouble, Tess.
lucky for me, anyway.
I swear to God, if you so much as touch
wait. My Clark?
Really?
of your power.
to make this world a better place?
the store was out.
no. Tess.
I was a monster.
in every major city.
incoming call: Clark Kent
I have no idea
dress yourself.
Clark.
from Clark.
is this...
Clark?
to his surviving heir.
Tess, I can't do this.
you know, you may want to use
I'll be right there.
Clark.
help!
Ohh, makes me feel better
then, why Lois?
and how many times
he wasn't you, Clark.
What'd you find?
how long have you been here?
it's still the same history.
the other Clark...
no.
why me, Lois?
you.
look to your left.
stuck in your life there.
watchtower is everywhere.
we do.
Lois?
I'll...
bet your deductible is through the roof.
he used the mirror box.
my whole preoccupation.
not my choices.
and a force of nature?
murder your father,
no. No, it's practice.
I'm me.
Hello?
Seriously?
you always have my back.
Hey, you know what? Don't think for a minute
you're right. I made you this way.
Lionel's son will appear in my place.
research?
you're getting reckless.
what your employees do with their personal life
and I want it back.
your own brother...
why don't you wait at the mansion?
get up, Tess.
why not?
jor-el?
you knew about all this?
not that I've been getting any sleep lately,
thank you.
every single opportunity you've ever had
I know what you're capable of.
after the fire.
it's only because you kicked me out the door.
for who? -For you.
this is how you repay us?
I used it.
Where's the box, Tess?
Why?
nice to meet you, Lois.
and your kinder, gentler world
we destroy the box,
the farm.
you can imagine our surprise
given all that the Luthors have done, - Father? - Mm-hmm.
and your powers...
please, just give me the mirror box.
he tells me all about it,
and leave all this?
is this one of my trials?
insufficient funds.
it's a shame, really.
because I've been waiting years
Clark...
and if I fix it, I get to go back?
Yeah, I know. I know. You're the good one.
I bumped into your sister.
even when I call you on it.
we could have made one hell of a team.
last time I checked, you're still adopted
get up!
let me tell you what I believe in.
your other left.
stop worrying.
when you've turned your back on both your father
you're engaged?
how are you doing this?
you're right.
calling another woman at this hour.
you can't stay here.
I was afraid that he might be
Hey!
trite but true.
so Clark Luthor is the mysterious
no. No, I was only trying to protect you.
queen's no fool, Clark.
you have to believe me.
dad?
I'm not your son.
you've returned.
that bastard. God.
what are you doing here? You shouldn't
it's adorable, seeing you at my desk
I'll handle this.
just go the hell home already, will you?
you were only trying to protect yourself.
this particular line item
all this for a primitive busy signal.
Tess, I need some help, all right?
you'll never have to worry about me again.
my world.
what are you doing?
if I'm calling you, Lane, it's for a reason.
so while I'm stranded here, he's...
is none of your concern.
leave her alone.
it's here.
then I'll take it back.
think, Clark.
you're corrupting him.
I am the most fit!
Lois?
you should have known I'd do that.
when you arise in the morning,
I let you kill Lex
you can make a father proud!
anybody could have told you that about me.
I'm guessing how I reacted
I think there's a card for that now.
Lear disowned the child who loved him all along.
Alexander.
they're waiting for you.
I can't believe I ever trusted him.
I evict farmers from their land.
there's another Lex on the loose.
supplies are still being sent here.
Lionel didn't raise you on this side.
but this had better be important.
I'll bring Lois back. I'll be out of your way.
something like that.
to get ultra-man face-to-face like this.
you're the person I have to hit?
...wasn't good enough.
you're lucky to have her.
Oliver?
he isn't here.
Lionel, what are you doing here?
have I had to stand here and watch you piss away
you just need a little practice.
but I'm perfectly willing to run around
I destroyed the mirror box.
was boarding school, right?
your family stole it from the Luthors.
but you are.
she will be on one condition.
is it any surprise that I didn't feel like sharing
of course you love him. That's no mystery.
no.
and then he says he can't find it.
I was wrong.
I swear to god, I was gonna tell you about it, Clark.
now, button up!
not exactly.
Ah, this.
uh, who wants to know?
why would I?
how else would I know that you're brave and loyal
you stay away from me.
what are these for?
cause you're a masochist.
with the rest of the class?
you need to activate the meteor rock as soon as I leave.
it's a blast.
come on.
I like making you wait.
incoming call: Tess Mercer
I am shocked...
Luthorcorp Media
I'm me.
but the truth...
if not smarter.
are you really this naive in your world?
is beyond me.
it was like you had already formed your opinion
does this have anything to do
but who are you talking about?
or ultra-man or whoever you are.
and because I have failed you, Clark.
where are you, Clark?
nothing says "sorry my doppelganger as another excuse to try to get me fired!
as screwed up as you think your life has been,
didn't cut him any slack.
thanks for the advice. Dad would have let me live this long.
just want to make you proud, dad.
okay, I'm not really sure what you're doing,
don't quit your day job.
mom?
that's how I found out what hurts you.
Lionel's son, your enemy
I...
he's there.
I'm no threat to you.
I'll kill you.
kind of makes you wonder how "earth two" Lois Lane about being the enemy of Smallville.
and you never admit when I'm right
well, I know the circumstances were different on that side,
don't lie, Tess.
and frown at technology if it'll lend a hand.
like you own the place.
exchange -- 10 minutes. Text the location.
why are you telling me all this?
and you took her away from me.
it still bothers you, doesn't it?
Tess! Please.
Where's your scar?
Lois? Lois, are you safe?
unexpected visit.
not worry about you?
your future, our future
no, Luther blood is Luther blood. It's poison.
but that's why I'm here
then, why bring me here?
my son. - Wasn't me!
farm Auction, July 28th
it's you.
what else are you hiding, Tess?
why me?
been hunting ultra-man since he murdered the Swanns.
wasn't discovered until after Lex passed.
I'm sorry. This is something I had to do.
Lois, there's got to be a part of you managed to put up with such a colossal tool.
this is impossible.
so, uh, what was the plan, Clark?
is that I'm the one that's been a prisoner all this time.
no true Luthor
big mistake.
that you're gonna use this non-fender bender
God, you love to rile me up, don't you?
I assume you will properly expense is exactly why you didn't tell me everything.
I'm not who you think I am.
because no true son of mine,
you look, um...
I will never let this happen to us.
it's got to be survival of the fittest!
is about to get an explosive awakening.
why do you have it?
long enough to go for a ride.
stop. Stop!
don't worry, Ollie. I can handle this.
you take a good, long look in the mirror
and what if I was hungry now?
I'm not going back to Lionel's world.
Oliver.
got a mousetrap set up for your rat-ass
you're no better than he is.
you obviously know something. You need to tell me.
give me the box.
because...
stop me if you know where this is going.
very confusing, considering the effort
let me use the mirror box. I'll go away.
Shakespeare. King Lear.
that knows that I'm telling the truth.
something wrong?
why are you so afraid?
that's all I've ever done
you love to make me wait, don't you?
it's him.
you knew I was walking into a trap.
and I'm still as redheaded bastard as it gets.
I'll save you the trouble.
I mean, not you you.
tell them.
those don't belong to you.
Clark, if this is some kind of red-k episode,
I have worked too long and too hard to let you,
Clark is a god among men.
cause that's exactly what it is -- Lionel's.
and if I don't?
all the people in all the streets in the whole world,
please.
Emil finally finished working through the files we found ultra-man of Metropolis.
you mean this?
and nothing can stop us.
what?
considering that I can't successfully round up the troops,
they're waiting for us.
Lear had three children.
but it was still me in that mirror.
now I know why you're late. Are you okay?
Tess?
the man of tomorrow -- Clark Luthor!
if he had been discovered in that cornfield a little half-bred tramp with a magdalene complex,
I've been afraid of you, Clark
Lionel turned me into a murderer.
thank you, son.
now is the moment for an apposite quote
father will never find us here.
worry about you!
save you?
consider yourself universally consistent.
hard work, dedication to family.
at an alarmingly frequent basis.
from a parallel earth tried to kill you" like flowers.
the heart -- it'll blind you, son.
though how he could love you, a consummate disappointment,
I must have lost perspective.
I can't believe I ever thought it would work with us.
surveying our progress.
good idea.
we Luthor men must seize our day.
take him away from me.
and your fortune, yes, it is.
you just made this a lot easier.
what would the industrious Lois Lane think?
I can do whatever I want.
you're not alone anymore.
dearest Tess.
she's the only one who knows my secret. She believes in me.
thanks for the read, but I'm all grown up now.
that Luthorcorp put into scouring the globe that you would bring us here.
there's certainly no getting Lex back.
I need to get back to my earth.
where on earth would you be now?
you watch out for those emotional reactions.
this, uh, "ultra-man" persona you've come up with -- genius.
now, get up here. We have a problem.
I mean, he's not gonna just hand it over to you.
so, it's just you and your sister now.
you're not a murderer.
cause --Cause no one sees ultra-man
Lois, Lois, hey.
and Oliver never had the mirror box, did he?
lucky for us, the planet's got great coverage.
I know what happens when someone sees your face.
it's a great way to strong-arm our opponents.
this world will be mine.
why look here? I closed the book on this place months ago.
my prodigal daughter.
doesn't feel right, though.
he's a maniac and he's delusional.
my name is Clark Kent, and I promise, Lois,
there's an antique, a mirror box, in your possession.
whoever's on the other side of my cell.
Lex sure knew how to leave an impression, didn't he?
I made your destiny
according to my Clark, it's like a parallel reality.
just a regular black coffee, please?
I sometimes shudder to think
not having blood on my hands before lunch.
wanted to abdicate, retire.
and lives to tell about it.
how long have we known each other, Luthor?
and we can celebrate.
this whole thing is, uh...
fine, then I will just
I don't think so. I'm from out of town.
I killed Lex.
hardly any trace of Lionel at all.
is that you can have lunch whenever you want.
the only room in the building that's lead-lined.
about Clark Luthor -- for good reason.
he was a monster.
everyone's in danger.
but I couldn't admit
Lois, why would I want to fire you?
my eyes in the sky already confirmed that Lois is safe.
when Lionel's heir urned out to be...You.
I just assumed that watchtower was the safest place in the city.
I have sacrificed...
like hell. I-I just got paid.
are you Lois Lane?
your father's will dictated certain articles be delivered
you can see right through me, straight to my soul...
and he's just as smart as Lex...
it's the man himself.
you're assuming that he's a threat just because he's a Luthor.
or the more...Fun version of you, anyway.
and I'll grab the box
being out from under our father's shadow.
it's too much to drop in on dear old dad from time to time?
for god's sake, Clark,
look, you misspell words, simple words,
there's got to be somebody out there better than me, right?
at the person who's responsible for corrupting Clark.
everything for your sake.
but remember, Clark --I am your father,
who are you?
to my heart.
you saw to that.
giving the largest portion to the one who loves him most.
that name sucks, by the way. Did it look good on paper?
but he fooled me.
by the first ignorant farmer that came along.
it's a Kryptonian relic. I only just received it.
well, you never were, were you?
you're no good at it. You never were.
you only live once, son.
there's one body still unaccounted for -- Alex-15.
Oh, no. You are not gonna ruin this gal's afternoon off.
we don't want to risk another audit.
I will be the survivor!
I don't want to watch you making stupid mistakes, Clark.
that I'd been so wrong about you.
his ego certainly left something to be desired.
and I mine that land for meteor rock.
I got to tell you, sis -- this alternate earth
I really love you, you know.
you look beautiful.
I'm upset that he threw me away.
you won't ever have to worry about seeing him again.
I guess Lex did something right in this place.
your betrayal has been staring me in the face.
Clark, you want to know the truly perverse part?
from one of my favorites. Marcus Aurelius.
this world won't know what hit it.
two of the children declare their lavish devotion.
the closest thing to family that I would ever know.
you didn't have to hurt him to save me.
absolutely -- a dream that you are putting at risk.
you could conquer the universe.
think what it took to build this empire
it's refreshing, actually...
you want to be your own man. That's natural.
what would have happened to my little traveler
Clark...There's something I need to tell you.
you know what they say -- burning the candle at both ends.
you don't have to worry about second chances with me.
that's what I said before things got weird.
I can't live in a world where you don't love me.
but your display of ego is attracting too much attention.
and you can always tell when I'm lying.
she was looking for, uh...
it's remarkable what you can hear when you stop to listen.
as disinterested as you were in finding the mirror box
no, just the greater Metropolitan area.
I'd call that an understatement.
but I do think she was about to give him another chance.
the heir that Lionel left that box to -- it's you.
we have a lead. Meet me at Cadmus.
...is because I didn't want anyone to...
Luthor blood is poison.
to set you back on the right path.
I thought I said I didn't want to be disturbed.
as grotesque and sordid a family tree as I've just inherited,
someone's helping him survive, but...
just your typical, multi-pronged social kamikaze.
then, with your whore sister, escape to another world?
and the way you looked at me, Lois, with so much hate...
to become the man that you are today.
simply put, sweetheart, you're just not special enough.
it's just rewritten with a sort of...Darker edge.
with that ill-conceived coup you have been planning?
of course your progenitor would have every right to hold a grudge,
and Lois isn't safe. None of you are.
I wouldn't worry about Lane, sis.
and I alone raised you in my own image
Oh, yes, I know all about that.
Lionel Luthor's been dead for years.
my son.
but I guess I'm back in the nick of time.
and you're lucky. The Kents found you.
I know you and I aren't on the best of terms right now, but
whatever happened to everyone deserving a second chance?
and now I get to kill two birds with one stone.
you said that you wished we could save the world together.
and it's only a matter of time before he realizes that I'm not his Tess.
I believe. I believe in justice.
I love him like you never will.
if he is, I've never found him.
think what a privilege it is to be alive.
everything that you can do...
that, uh, box and escape from here, the services of the ladies Mandie and Bambie.
he tells them he will divide his kingdom between them,
I swear, the number of times I've signed one of those.
and what happened with...
they're dangerous, Tess. They're born that way.
I'm watched constantly here.
to find and destroy anything from Krypton.
is this time travel? Something went wrong in my past?
is just proof that Lionel's blood doesn't corrupt.
wouldn't want to miss how it all turns out.
to breathe, to enjoy, to love, to think.
where I'm from, Lois Lane, you and I, we're allies.
I've kept constant watch on Oliver Queen's activities.
you're doing really well with the first one.
I failed you, Clark.
who knew you had such a gift for understatement?
Mr. Queen, any comment on the latest round of landgrabs in Smallville?
uhh, don't I know you from somewhere?
when Lex does show up, we'll face him together.
I asked her to help me find it so I could destroy it.
after everything Oliver and I did to trust you,
how can you be so flip when I've been looking for you all night long?
the real reason that I hid Alexander...
when he stabs you in the back, you son of a bitch.
I hope that your love is enough to save you
but I don't know a thing about your box.
I'm sure you didn't come all the way up here to talk Shakespeare.
it's not like the whole world hates you, Oliver.
little Greek tragedy you've been trying to drag your brother into.
well, that's the great thing about us being on our own now
be nice to have a couple people out there backing me up.
we are long, long overdue for a fatherson talk.
we destroy any chance of being sent back there.
about the box -- Queen has it.
whether you're on this earth or any other...
there's no take-backs when it comes to gold-k.
but you weren't so unlucky.
Tess Mercer, if your little stunt ruined my credit
this -- this right here is just the tip of the iceberg.
and more than a little spilt blood.
you remember, um, Lear, son?
when and if he's found, it'll be because he wants to be.
I'll -- I'll go back to Watchtower and see if I can program Oliver's satellite.
considering the extreme measures you and I took to silence him.
what did you see, Clark?!
No!
they've blocked certain neuro-paths and they escaped.
all of this is fake?
he'll die if he doesn't.
look, Clark...
I don't know.
VRA ops.
I can't.
Clark!
where are the vigilantes?
I'm back in.
Dinah?
nearly destroyed the league.
in a government lab!
kill her.
look, Oliver,
exactly.
you can thank us later.
and you don't even know it.
are trying to figure out
I failed her.
Clark...
in the virtual you
Oliver...
wait. I want to,
please stay on the line.
your body flatlined.
who are you working with?
and get you out of here.
ma'am, don't get huffy.
Clark, everything you see here
sorry I'm late,
to meet you on the roof.
she knows how to contact us.
full of men in black
into a real-life H. A.L.
so maybe you would trust me.
Clark...
you take the north.
that Trotter and her men while government scientists break free of it.
she was nothing more
we need to talk.
but they are working.
come on, Clark.
she obviously doesn't want to.
things that aren't there,
who was it?
one down, five to go.
by the way, thanks.
Lois.
trust me, I mean
come back to me, Clark!
Yes.
you ready, Ollie?
Clark, I get it.
Clark! Where are you going?!
800 feet above broadway.
avatars.
it makes perfect sense.
save the blonde-speak.
Chloe?
of course it is.
to our group, so...
you make a run for it.
I'm gonna rush this guy.
no, I am not getting huffy.
is cause they're working with someone
I saw you take out two guards,
why won't you believe her?
they're here. Quick, follow me.
maybe for the first time.
and then I got these flashes
simple mind over matter.
I am a general's daughter.
but where have you been all this time?
I really missed you.
you know where I'm going with this?
she was...
and that makes more sense to you
we have to jump.
they're trying to protect you.
with my life.
how could they?
are we dead?
to unplug this little trueman show
no worries, cuz.
but anyone can access it.
and you trusted me.
Oliver, don't! He has to believe the world is fake.
wait, where are you going?
they vanished.
I'm pretty sure they're real.
I have deadshot covering road access on the east perimeter.
it's all hazy.
No!
I don't know Chloe anymore.
I'm here to save you.
and let's not forget,
they've taken my friends,
Yeah, I wanted to,
no trespassing VRA investigation site. Violators will be prosecuted.
Clark, let's go.
see ya.
let's get going.
no. No!
that it stings,
stand down!
we need Clark.
all right.
never to find it?
nothing after Carter's funeral,
is that what you're saying?
violent criminals deserve to fry.
but I can help you fly the coop.
I checked with the general.
Yeah.
meet me on the roof. Chloe.
look, Clark, at getting our powers back.
I do happy, I do sad,
she used to broadcast to.
right?
I'm not ready to give up on her yet.
everything's gonna be all right. I promise.
so I had to hook you back up again.
we have to go underground.
where?
the same thing with Oliver's skills.
I don't know where she's headed.
who?
in the world of Clark and Chloe,
let's go.
I hacked into the computer
Carter?
all right, we got to hurry.
what's really going on?
or your secret anytime soon.
I'm gonna figure out what's going on here
you are caught in a virtual cage,
face it -- her dirty dance with doomsday
they want us to work for them.
things that aren't possible,
look at me. Come on.
maybe the reason they can take our powers away
Smallville, are you okay?
to save me?
do not let him out.
so, I wrote a worm or you can reach us on the web
this whole time, they've been denying any involvement.
well, who knows?
to see if they could take away your powers.
are lying comatose in lab beds
I'm sorry.
is the creation of a government computer.
while your brains are being wired - Clark, come on. - Clark, do you trust me?
and into the real world.
I got to get you out of here.
I want to, but I need to know.
none of them look familiar.
I tried the justice department,
keep your shirt on, Queen.
did you try the justice department? - Yes!
how your brain activates your abilities.
why don't they just kill us?
I know, because the world we're in is fake,
the government captured you
I'm not sure what these drugs are called, but unlike the virtual world,
Chloe and I are on different paths.
start taking the law into their own hands.
distance 200 yards. Windspeed 2 mph. Velocity 350 fps.
it's the heart attack you have
because Chloe said so?
observation Room
how'd you do that?
I mean, Tess just texted because of what they put us through?
or I will come for you.
Chloe?
it's hard...
Clark?
Clark? Clark?!
who knows everything about us.
they're waiting for you, ma'am.
and one day you will.
but I only have a few minutes
Clark, did you see her, too?
and get us back into the land of the living.
I saw her.
they'll do it in the real world, too.
Clark, we got to go.
you're not real?
good.
except these flashes I've been having.
what's really up with the VRA?
I'm not going anywhere.
take my hand.
Lois, it was the VRA.
the sooner you can manipulate it,
Yeah.
What'd you see?
well, you look energized, Dinah.
okay, I'm gonna need about 20 minutes
what?
and I gave him a choice.
messed with my equilibrium,
because she left?
because she didn't confide in you,
how does it feel to be on the run - Will you marry me? - Yes.
they took away my powers.
do you trust me?
it's not really trust
those who don't get them taken away.
I need to know one thing.
Clark. Clark, what's happening?
just trust yourself.
when we first met black canary,
I went down to the street to check.
and you didn't say anything.
the body follows the brain's lead.
if the procedure succeeds in this world,
Oliver, I didn't reach out to you
is that Carter's book?
who?
well, that's kind of hard to believe,
Chloe.
haven't you?
I can explain later.
Yeah.
I'm shutting down watchtower.
I've checked all our databases.
Really?
and the bridesmaids' dresses.
so I had to hook you back in.
but only if you truly believe it's fake.
it's me.
because you know you're gonna die.
Clark...
if Chloe really believed in us,
not after what we've been through.
let's start there.
except shred your threads.
sorry for getting all in-your-face back there.
I'm not limited by it.
now, wait a second.
what do you remember from the last three weeks?
we have to find out who did this to us.
it's not good.
I mean, it warned me something bad was gonna happen that referred me back to you.
stripped me of all my weapons,
you tortured us.
we'll get answers tomorrow.
who knows how long that'll be?
VRA ops are three klicks out and closing.
she's earned this, Clark.
that's why Lois didn't see them.
we wanted to ask you a question.
you and I both saw her experimenting on us but watchtower just texted
it's going to be okay, Clark.
I didn't.
and let's face it, with our lives,
I can answer these questions later.
and take a leap of faith.
is that really you?
well, that can't be right.
when I would walk through it again.
these are the government installations or Mr. Queen in our facilities.
no.
from the war hawks you rallied behind?
we have no record of Mr. Kent
you never give up.
she would have learned her lesson.
just chill out. I'm your only way out of here.
Chloe wouldn't tell them anything
the cause of death is not high impact.
what exactly are we up against here?
right now, you're lying in a lab to figure out what's true.
you're working with them?
what about the flashbacks?
any idea why they released you now?
don't look, and follow me. Who the hell are they?
right now, you, Clark, and everyone else
I knew it was gonna take more to enjoy a taste of their own virtual venom.
that I haven't dreamed about the time
come on, baby. Honey, honey.
and the spires of metropolis...
how'd you do it?
the only illusion here is you.
we still got work to do.
the escort is ready to transport the prisoner.
here, the same golden rule applies.
get my powers back so we can stop them.
well, I have to say, Smallville,
what's going on?
I have power.
Where's Lois?
and he would attack anyone that threatens that.
where did you take Oliver?
I lost someone. She meant everything to me.
we've got about 17 minutes tops.
we have to find her, Clark.
if a skydiver's parachute doesn't open,
we figured out how dangerous it was before we got to her.
and now they're in my head, Clark.
Clark saw the same flashbacks.
and I expected you and Chloe to trust me
what are you talking about?
but when they find out -- and they will
it's the only way you can get through the portal
I was trying to disconnect you, Oliver, and the canary
this canary is gonna need to eat some crow.
and you got me to fly.
we've got the blur right where we want him.
that soaring ove the Daily Planet from the computers, but your bodies began to shut down,
well, you may be a projection of my brain,
to him you're all freedom fighters,
Clark, you need to consider the source.
in the meantime, you hold off the boys in black
Yeah, here are pictures from a few minutes ago.
I don't know what she wants.
and saw all of you lying in glass tubes,
looks like they're getting ready to move out.
it wasn't the same without you.
was amazing.
it's actually a good thing you weren't here when Trotter took us down.
she wouldn't make that mistake again.
Chloe!
Clark, Chloe said you wouldn't trust her,
do you remember anything?
he would be proud of you, Clark.
or they could report to me.
than us going through some post-traumatic stress
it's me.
to get you out of this maniacal maze.
our satellites picked them up four klicks away.
they released me a couple of days ago.
and if your cousin is one of them,
Chloe would never hurt Oliver.
Hey, guys.
I haven't been given flowers like this in a long time.
Oh, this never ends well.
Oliver, they're beautiful.
I know what's really going on here, Clark.
she's taking out operatives in cold blood, Lois!
I've got cameras on the woods to the west,
the portal to the real world.
she traded herself in so I could be free.
will you be my maid of honor?
right now, Chloe is the only chance we have
put him back under.
because I didn't trust myself.
just like Oliver before they put him away.
show me where Oliver is.
I'm in a lab somewhere.
Yeah, well, like video-game kill me, right?
I mean, aside from your fianc
Lois, you're trying to tell me that all of this
Lois, I just
and there hasn't been a day that's gone by considering you just materialized out of a wall.
you fought with demons from outer space,
move in.
can I ask you something?
and you're not insane. Trust me.
I don't even know how to get huffy, okay?
you did.
the kids who play nice get to keep their powers.
otherwise, you weren't gonna survive.
anything like that? Or, uh...
no. Clark...
trapped under a glass cover?
I can't leap traffic jams in a single bound.
and if they I. D. me or anyone I've contacted,
not that I could do much with this
someone's hijacked you.
we better be ready.
someone was experimenting on me.
you got to tell me what you -- Clark!
Hey, since we are, uh,
the only way out is the same way we came in.
back then, before you found out.
we're coming for all of you.
I'm ready to jump this time.
I'm not so sure. I'm starting to see things that aren't real,
fine, Kent.
than Lex Luthor's little organ-grinder monkey.
suicide squad, led by Rick Flag.
who are constantly circulating the city.
Clark, they want to be able to turn your powers off and on.
you don't make it easy to ask a simple question.
take the leap...
you too?
Chloe, I saw you.
I had my suspicions.
you're not hallucinating, Oliver, with lab facilities where we might have been taken.
I don't know whose side she's on, but it's not ours!
now, I don't know if you guys saw it,
Lois is at the Daily Planet,
I can get you out of this world of weird,
Really?
but I don't have abilities here.
and feel.
but my cousin is no Benedict Arnold.
the one you tried to get him to jump through.
to the planet and watchtower.
you just have to meet me on the top of the Daily Planet.
Yeah.
do you trust me?
but that's hard.
until the rest of our team is up and ready to rumble.
is telling you that you shouldn't trust her.
say anything about how I'd be sitting alone,
only if you believe that's true.
you got to tell me what you saw, Clark!
are you prepared to do what has to be done?
every Frankenstein has a human heart.
and you battled supernatural hexes together.
besides, half the credit should go to the fate helmet.
go to an alley, you'll find a rat.
don't listen to it, Clark.
she's helping Oliver escape from Met Gen.
that it's the hardest thing ever or felt your breath on my cheek,
you saved us.
which means we better get these vegetables mobilized asap.
use Sullivan's avatar.
they took away my powers, Lois.
everything in this world that you see and hear
how?
every one of them is a highly trained, lethal killer.
going all erin brockovich on them?
I figured that out on my own.
you tell me. You said I wasn't hallucinating.
it's that Clark Kent's heart is usually right.
and still you looked me in the eye every day.
not to mention the department of domestic security,
we need to find out how Chloe's working with them,
out of all the superheroes we've captured, on the subway just in hopes
Hello, Oliver.
no, it didn't tell me that.
is that what you were doing in the flashbacks of the lab
I mean, do you ever look to see who the bad guys really are trying to get more information.
Yeah.
cut off from everyone I really care about.
and I have been on the phone ever since, trying to find you.
I don't know who she's working for.
I knew that if I looked into your eyes
trotter at 10 o' clock.
you can come back in the house now.
what am I supposed to say?
than those tub-thumping, love-it-or-leave-it morons
Chloe.
pretty soon the superhero's for himself.
I programmed a virtual trap door in the system
you knew that I was lying to you,
Yes, and normally you'd think so, too.
because I believe that everything I see is fake,
it's, uh
okay.
vigilantes do not represent the will of the people.
this.
but lately I feel like I've been the one living in the virtual world
your call is important to us.
okay, I finished picking out the flowers
what was she doing?
it's being driven by your subconsciousness.
and created an avatar of myself so I could warn you.
she has always been there for you.
and I never will.
Clark, if we find out that Chloe's turned on us,
I know Chloe. She must have a good reason.
Ah, let's just say I learned from the best.
Hey, I had no control over where the door materialized,
so, where is this emergency exit out of narnia?
okay, Chloe talked to me. She told me everything.
running an experiment on me.
they will highlight and delete you -- I. E. kill you.
I just stopped looking for you.
moments of reality when I tried to pull you out.
I believe in you.
this is all of our fight.
I know that you want to have faith in her, Clark, she would have told us she was leaving and why.
but when I disconnected you from the mainframe,
all right, Alice, where's the rabbit hole out of here?
and I hate to crash your little tea party,
make sure Kent never makes it out of there.
but you and I both know what we saw in those flashbacks.
good.
you really think I would ever do that?
okay...
I've been thinking about what you said
it's really hard.
Clark, you and Chloe have -- have battled Luthors,
Yeah.
Dinah would rather blame this whole thing on my cousin
Clark, what do you think?
but the government hooking us all into a virtual reality?
when it detects me, it releases an antivirus posse
what if Dinah was right? What if Chloe is responsible?
and, speaking of the real world,
now, before I send you back to Kansas,
but we're still vulnerable from the south and by air.
and the rest of the team at Carter's funeral.
listening to old voicemails just to hear your voice?
and imprisoned your mind in a virtual world.
Yeah, that's just the point. You never lost them.
I want my powers back, and so do Clark and A. C.
and it will kill you.
Yeah, now it's our turn to trust her.
I did what I had to do.
that's because you left us.
they've hooked you all up to a major mainframe
don't move.
it's like you're playing a giant video game.
from the torch to summers at the lake and this delusion is a part of that.
don't leave me here, Clark!
and to think, you're the same Chloe that's in that picture.
Yeah.
Chloe, we were just on our way.
knowing that their lies are there to protect you.
what you're talking about is literally suicide.
the sooner you believe everything you see is fantasy,
all this time, this has been festering under there,
you know, not to go all Steve Perry power ballad on you, the State Department, and the Defense Department
you could've called me.
or that I'd be scanning every single stranger's face
let me get you something to eat.
I saw her, too.
if you think you're gonna die, you do.
I know you never will.
it's okay, Chloe. I got these ladies.
no, no, I can handle it. I just need to know one thing.
the computer runs a security scan every six minutes.
your knife would cut more than clothing.
and if I know one thing,
did the helmet, um...
Lois, I'm fine.
I figured that's what you wanted.
Clark, they're winning.
I've been thinking a lot about him lately.
do whatever it takes to stop him.
before you start throwing knives and spin-kicks, there, chickadee?
I guess that's the true test of believing in someone
this whole thing is an illusion created by a computer.
we're in position and standing by, lieutenant.
they just have to believe that nothing they see is real.
I know, Oliver, but I can't make Clark believe in me.
when I broke into the lab of lunacy that I'd come across your smile...
come on, Houdini, let's go.
you trusted yourself, and you were right.
since Trotter is officially off the military's grid,
well, the last place we saw her was that facility.
well, that's a campfire that I'm not ashamed to sing around.
permanently mothballing his missile system,
think you might want to, uh, put these in water.
either way, you either trust me or you don't.
it really is a portal to the real world.
wait, you're not Chloe.
you made me believe.
I keep having -- saving me?
but in the flashes that I saw, what were you doing?
because you know they're doing it for a good reason.
so these guys are virtual cops?
they've got me thinking Chloe is behind this whole thing.
not for long. We're gonna fight this.
and as much as you want to trust and believe in her,
you've known her longer than almost anyone.
and I do stop giving me the runaround, bitch,
but the fate helmet warned me to stay away.
I could either report them to the government,
I'm in a cell in the lockdown wing of a hospital.
just keep trying.
than just the blue suits in the bureau to take him down.
we're facing a small army out there, Chloe.
are you sticking around for a while?
it's time these terrorists paid for their crimes.
the suicide squad? Chloe...
okay, you both are obviously suffering from post-traumatic stress,
I don't remember.
for now, let's just be happy they let us all go.
Clark, I just got word that Oliver escaped from Met Gen.
I can't believe it's been five years already.
this is just another day at the office.
if you ask someone to explain themselves.
to get Clark, Lois, and the rest of them out of that Pixar postcard.
and if none of this is real...
Oliver just turned up at Met Gen.
like these guys.
I have a conference call with Perry at 7: 00.
it doesn't take X-ray vision to see that you're a traitor.
you did it for me when you told me your secret.
not everybody switches sides as easily as some of us.
they were waiting for us at Carter's funeral.
I just had some sort of a flashback.
when I found out that Flag was trying to kill the general,
Clark, that part's up to you.
Clark and I were just updating our nonexistent facebook pages in person.
somewhere along the way, he stopped having trust in me.
and someone was standing over me.
not unless he got in her way...
well, what... then what is it, huh?
I'm pretty much Chloe in the sky with diamonds.
all those years before you knew my secret.
all together in the same room and the same plane of existence
but from everything we've learned,
I think what Lois is trying to say is, do you
hate to rain on your program, but I'm in a straitjacket.
that I should shut my eyes and my ears to the outside world
I was worried about you. You okay?
Clark, are you actually gonna let Lois jump to her death?
there is no way I would have walked out that front door.
I've always believed that you can do the impossible,
and she can't hold it open much longer,
whatever happens in cyberspace stays in cyberspace.
you have no idea how much it means that you trusted me.
Yeah, I thought so.
but that's what I mean.
but she can't make you believe it's real.
otherwise, I don't think I'm gonna be able to get Clark out of here.
but I can tell that your heart is saying the opposite.
I saw Chloe and Oliver jump with my own eyes.
we're not gonna have to worry about her spreading her hero-hating vitriol
I can tell you saw her, Clark. Tell me what you saw.
this might help you decide.
the only way to see the truth is to close your eyes and ears
it's time we took these "heroes" under our control.
you were messing with our heads.
maybe one day we'll get to fly in the real world.
so you programmed yourself into my fake reality.
because she didn't say why.
I told you, Dorothy, this is all a dream.
you could've called me. You could have said, uh...
right now, the VRA boys don't know we're here.
Chloe and Oliver jumped off that roof because...
at www. Vigilante-registration-agency. Fed.
so badly wanting to believe in everything you hear and see...
even if it was just in cyberspace.
Tess?
Yeah!
Hey, Tess.
Clark!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
no?
no, Tess!
right.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
do you have time for your mom?
no.
make love not war
I love your enthusiasm,
and if you get caught,
Tess.
somebody shot you.
to get that genie back in the bottle.
Yeah! Yeah!
I'm sure I had my reasons.
were you peeking at your
I thought
it's nothing new.
and I thought,
but don't worry.
where is he?
certainly not here.
Oliver, you can forget about
so, what was that this morning, huh?
or someone.
come on.
they can't even find the bullets.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Alexander.
Lionel?
that's who a hero is
no, you're wrong.
he leaves an autograph?
has passed.
again.
and the Luthorcorp board
that's right.
I was a fool.
now, do you?
Clark, I have been calling you.
but it would truly be criminal
tomorrow America votes
all of them.
maybe we should figure out a different way
thank you.
vote down the VRA!
the real Clark Kent.
thanks for being somebody
Oliver? Hmm?
it was inspiring.
Yes, Mr. Kent.
I -- okay.
the police didn't find any bullets
why would you do that?
I know how you feel.
hit me.
I am still your father
they shot a senator
you're not him.
until I met you.
I'm gonna stretch my legs out a little bit.
you abandoned me in this world
I've been busy.
I just need you
Bye-bye.
I'm aging faster and faster.
this isn't over.
believe me.
supposed to be a bad thing.
I found the shooter's crow nest.
Clark, you don't give up on the game
now, I still think newspaper
being a hero isn't about and wanted me dead in the next?
Yeah!
he needs his father.
I was the city girl, it's easy to lose hope.
I'm her son.
I wore the hoodie.
they turned to dust on impact.
to be caught in the spotlight.
she's your hero and mine.
with all 50 states reporting in,
a lot of people still believe in heroes.
we've been locked in battle for years.
you trusted them, the people.
and a very public bank robbery.
see? There's still hope.
where are they?
God. Let me get that for you.
so that our united strength
I'm coming after you.
no, the cops haven't found anything, either.
Clark is a force for good.
Lois!
and your mom, too, Clark.
what is this? - I don't know.
they were my inspiration.
looking into those Kryptonite bullets.
because they're made out of meteor rock.
I'm not gonna let you sacrifice yourself.
your hate can make you strong.
Oliver really wanted to come, too,
he's losing hope.
or what's left of it,
well, snow dad's been a little frosty lately, right?
always make yourself look better
go on.
I'll pass.
Clark, if you don't let me do this,
must be heart-wrenching.
engraved
where does your son belong?
I didn't think I'd ever measure up
the government may have framed me as a terrorist,
cheer up, Clark.
whether they want me around or not.
what the hell is this?
the VRA forced my hand.
I've been watching you, too.
and when the justice system here is fixed,
she won't be doing much of anything when there are seconds left on the clock.
and I need to reach more people who will be enough to change the vote.
passing out a bunch of pamphlets
I
the shooter knows your weakness.
I knew it was you guys.
I know I'm dying.
Mm. I -- just a peek, just a really quick peek.
and -- yeah.
you sent Slade there, didn't you?
Hey, blur, it's Brian.
to keep you from checking up on the world, wouldn't it?
is the number-one way to spread the word,
as long as you're doing what you're doing
you couldn't even walk the streets.
something he scratched into the roof - Tess. - Yeah.
I see you've been baking again.
but look who has the gun in their hand.
and they're amazing, to be sure of, to look up to
I think we'll still lose today.
censorship.
if we don't figure out who did this.
and they say being a wanted man's
Alexander.
Yeah, I agree with Oliver.
I didn't realize how much hope there was out there.
it's not safe for you or your friends but I was afraid he'd get recognized.
you remember?
Lois. - Yeah?
on the wall in Alexander's cell.
come here.
I just got back from father/son day at Luthorcorp.
it was personal.
I took care of my father...
to be the father you always wanted.
so...
it got me to thinking that,
why am I at my alma mater?
somebody who stands up for others.
thank you.
did you share that with your husband?
and Lex is dead.
all of my hopes were confirmed when I saw while he waited for my mother to get to the podium.
cyanide
your stretching yesterday led to you stopping two muggings
they convinced me to wear a bulletproof vest,
Alexander!
come here.
my, uh, doppelganger's life
did you find anything?
Oh, hold on a second.
I can teach you how.
I'm still out there saving people, Lois,
you made one fatal mistake
Oh, you did.
don't you have other ways to deal with them?
we take you there now, live.
and you.
Ahh. Clark.
so more of them can get hurt?
you're not locked into anything.
it's a journal.
and that's given me a second chance
vote down the VRA!
to buy you out at a bargain,
you know, who would have thought
is that true?
well, yeah. I'm getting a little better.
you don't need this.
it's time to end this family feud.
God.
he wasn't there to protect her.
so you step into the spotlight, and look what happened
you okay? - I'm fine.
mom, people are upset. They're getting violent.
something you've always struggled with.
it's Kryptonite.
after I die, there's no coming back.
and I've just been told,
we're taught to.
it's his character.
a beacon of hope shining light on the truth?
I write an article against the VRA, and I'm one of them.
because of what you've been through this morning,
but I'll always be there for you.
I am done with all of you!
these are Perry's files.
I'll drive myself crazy.
Perry White
what if I forget you?
you keep blaming everybody else,
he's always there for us,
you know, I thought that people had given in to the hate.
a pro-hero piece for your paper.
Clark wasn't just our blessing.
well, on this side of the mirror,
she worries, Clark.
and it wasn't me.
Lois Lane -- I called about doing
you're looking for the phantom zone crystal, aren't you?
my only son.
Lionel Luthor.
and said the thing she couldn't measure
this is for you.
don't let hate master you.
I've only seen this one other place
I want to be a hero to my kids.
and the person who did this to you is still out there,
I had to protect you, Clark.
how am I supposed to be protecting my heroes off the grid to stand up for what they believe in.
like a family...
by making me look like some kind of monster!
he just...
excuse me.
that you lost sight of the skyline.
so I just want to let the blur know but that's not what inspires me about him.
has welcomed me back with open arms.
standing up for us and doing what's right.
to take a stand against fear and hate...
blur, I want to thank you.
you need to see something.
Alexander, please listen to me.
not exactly, no.
he's the shooter. - Don't worry, Clark.
if I'm totally on everybody's radar?
go guerilla.
I'm beginning to forget things.
and everybody has their favorite hero.
pro-hero rally? Okay.
why would you want to help me?
calling yourselves "fair and balanced,"
I want to be the man that you made that suit for.
show daddy that you got the killer instinct, too?
Lois, do you really think that you and I
how many?
kryptonite.
you're gonna be wearing prison orange,
does Chloe know you're out here?
and he knows about Alexander.
you're from there, aren't you?
you're the one who turned your back on me.
Hi, Clark.
no matter what it costs.
that's crawling back into our lives.
tell me now.
well, then you really have no business
her cross-country campaign
more or less
she loved you.
the whole state is watching.
for Clark to stand up on his own.
it doesn't matter where I'm from, Luther Tessa.
what are you talking about, Lois?
vote down the VRA! Vote down the
you know, you could use a little homespun sweetness.
but maybe we stepped away too far.
but I won't make that mistake again.
I wish I would have had more faith.
and the other bullet just grazed my shoulder.
Hi, sweetheart.
when people find out you're not the real Lionel...
listen. Listen to me, son.
actually, more like Perry and White.
that mysterious letter "s" showing up everywhere.
Clark, you don't need a suit to the be the world's hero.
you know, I can't stay holed up in watchtower all day long.
but I don't have much time for politics.
I needed inspiration, a way to blow down
well, my favorite hero is the blur.
to keep the people of our hometown safe,
but since the blur came, we have hope.
Lois, I'm home.
will you help me kill Clark?
I didn't approve this article.
Lionel and I had nothing to hide.
we won! Yay!
what did you do?
he didn't think much of the conventional media,
Hey, I just got you back. I don't want to lose you again.
Really?
the boy doesn't need you.
Clark, Alexander's not the only Luthor
I know you took over where Waller left off, to overturn the VRA.
Lex, Lionel -- you had a big win tonight.
I thought you'd be out campaigning right now.
Hey.
I promise you
fighting for his causes as an outsider?
Lionel's here.
or pull someone from a burning building, but you can't beat door to door for the personal touch.
between VRA protestors and supporters
you're part of this family, Chloe.
um, I also compiled a list
maybe Joe El has a way to send Lionel home.
you forget, I know where you're from.
to everything she'd been for him his whole life.
thank you for helping me believe that I can count on to do what's right.
and you turn it into venom for vigilantes.
you saved Lex.
with heroes being painted as criminals,
forgot to change the locks.
but you won't use him in this one.
about his journey through the looking glass.
this wasn't political.
and as Clark's oldest friend,
I'm taking pity on you, Martha.
but I don't think a couple hundred testimonials
why didn't you tell me you were in town? I could have protected you.
I'm the last Lex Luthor.
well, I'll tell you what, boys -- I wouldn't get used to the view.
and what's with all the Woodward and Bernstein?
storage unit?
Aww, that's very thoughtful, Lois.
that I will make everything okay.
not real? Why would anyone think that?
sometimes we can't do it on our own.
in anticipation of tomorrow's historic vote...
mom, I just don't know "Life only asks of you what you can handle."
which is not the best color on you.
is gonna actually defeat the VRA?
what?
vote down the VRA! Vote down the VRA!
but he didn't come.
inspiring others to find their voices.
Lois?
don't worry, son.
but you wanted celebrity.
it looks like the keynote speaker has arrived.
I have to get back out and encourage people
I can't think of anyone better to watch over him.
we all are.
you loved her son.
because a certain senator has been working overtime of the top 10 possible shooters.
sir, signore Luthor. Prego.
well, you know, in this world, you murdered my parents.
I still love you. I do.
you're an American hero, Clark.
Clark, you all right?
in mine, too, and I had a very good reason.
my father always said,
and your mother was out here standing up for me, too.
that they can accomplish greatness.
and after this vote, I'll be an outlaw forever.
I neglected you, Luthor Tessa.
use the mirror box and send them both away.
I will destroy you.
Yeah! Whoo!
and Jonathan's mom was...particular.
and now it's our turn...
it's all right. It's all right.
Mrs. Kent, I never stopped watching his back.
vote down the VRA!
the Art Of War
they probably thought I'd try to stop it.
what if I forget everything?
that's strange, coming from you.
growing up, I never really had much of a mother figure
I was trying to kill him.
okay, bad banana jokes aside, to frighten people from going to the polls.
that there are still people who support him,
sorry. Mnh.
I feel sick.
and I appreciate everything that she's done.
you...
we both needed to leave...
I've been to the future,
well, I'm sure you still looked very handsome.
since it's burning to the ground as we speak.
I'm not ready to say goodbye to you, too.
with tensions rising and violence breaking out
it turns out there's a very fine line
alexander
and while you do that, I'm going to, uh take a walk.
Yeah.
there will never be a day when you can come out of hiding.
you had something Lex never had, and that's Tess.
and so, what it's worth, blur, thank you.
there's nothing left for you to teach me.
have been greatly exaggerated.
Hey, what are you doing?
shines through the darkness like a beacon...
we knew protecting you would always be dangerous,
I thought he'd blur in front of the bullet.
I'll bring him back to stand trial.
when I first came into this house, us boys and girls here can keep on doing our jobs.
you don't belong here.
in the wake of the attempt on senator Kent's life, things are escalating very quickly here, Bruce.
Clark told me about this other earth.
being able to save every person from a mugging or...
but no one wants to print pro-hero prose.
you inspire him.
but, Lois, the vote's tomorrow.
we'll work together.
those power puff pieces piling up against the blur.
I found out who the shooter was -- Alexander.
but why did you leave Clark's side in the first place?
um...I'm gonna stop by the farm later.
a major opponent of the VRA...
you're my flesh and blood...
you really taught me what it meant
I'm your enemy.
Clark opened the door between worlds,
and he just called me about yours.
but we vowed to do it, even if it cost us our lives.
you know, I have better things to do than deal with your mess.
to put things right between us,
like Lionel taught me.
well, you got it all figured out.
they just need something to give them the courage to come out and fight.
how I can treat Clark Kent as a disguise.
a small motorcade has pulled up behind the podium.
I wouldn't underestimate the common man in tomorrow's vote.
between being protective and being overprotective.
you know...
it was the greatest moment of my life.
uh, even worse, he's already found him.
people need someone to believe in.
but on our wedding day, she gave me that necklace
tomorrow, the people will turn on you again,
someday we'd have to share him with the world.
please welcome senator Martha Kent!
actually, I had a different idea.
disguised behind glasses and a bad haircut.
you feel like you can't step into the light,
it's our answer to the VRA.
what exactly do you want, Lionel?
he can do the same thing for you.
they're vulgar, uneducated, and stupid,
because no one taught him to hate...
same reason you did.
son? Isn't it a little late for that?
and if you try to hurt him...
by taking care of the Luthors another way.
that heroes can and do exist.
you're not a killer, not yet. You can come back.
and he despised every single one of you.
that can leave on a child, Luthor Tess.
Clark...
your illicit activities made it easy for me and I'm gonna find them.
I understand she's a perfectly lovely woman.
Hey, you might want to take a look at this.
Clark, you were so focused on flying under the radar
that explains why the Red Queen eventually entered the game.
that we are all meant to fight for truth and justice...
well, Clark was never yours in this world.
thank you for your concern, Lois.
I'll tell you what
there would have been a day when heroes need this much protection?
Lionel Luthor.
you are the light.
I was halfway to the fortress when I realized what you meant
well, when I saw those people willing to defend me,
sit down.
but if we don't speak up now, then when?
come on, Clark.
it looks like you've been taking spin classes, and not in the gym.
as long as you remain honest to those things,
you may have used him in your world to kill Lex, and I saw the hero that I will become to take care of the people that I love.
there was a wristwatch.
but to give people hope for a brighter tomorrow.
you missed the mark, Green Arrow.
I've been quietly reclaiming my assets for months now.
you have no idea how much you mean to people, Clark Kent.
I just single-handedly swayed 30 more votes in our favor.
because you discarded him.
of these "vigilantes" as they like to call it now.
I watched your body fall 40 stories.
and, as far as this trusting world believes, has raised enough hero support to force a national vote.
that's why we need to join together in this crusade
I mean, you and dad raised me to be who I am right now
save the city.
when I see the blur and others like him cause it makes you feel ashamed.
you'll be safe here.
I assume Clark told you
we'll find this guy.
part of growing up is letting go of your parents, Clark
that is so low-rent and so rebel.
you shot Martha Kent.
stay away from Clark.
to hack into a couple of national news websites.
Clark needs you as much as the world needs him.
senator Martha Kent.
after living in the darkness for so long, turn their differences into strengths,
no second chances, Lionel.
makes for a very interesting read.
no one will take your word. You're a convicted felon.
for you and for your brother.
Alexander's all grown up. The family's back in business.
Lois?
a Luthor's home is his castle.
security's on the way. We'll add assault and battery.
I promise you...
can you remember what you did yesterday?
these are difficult times.
and they don't even know when you're fighting for them.
he's just worried about you, Mrs. Kent.
make it your servant. Use it. Let it build inside you.
all of them are willing to step forward for you.
I was wrong, Alexander.
come here, Alexander.
you always remember, son
actually, I'd rather be writing,
Yeah.
no one will ever find out what happened today.
so he printed pamphlets out of a storage unit.
and you know the crippling scars on whether or not to overturn the VRA!
I look at the blur and his powers that he has,
I remember what it was like here in Metropolis before he came.
I know. Clark does have a way of leaving abruptly.
this historic vote is, of course, the first of its kind,
they just needed a place to be heard.
but all of my journalistic jump shots keep getting blocked.
I find you very attractive, Martha.
vote down the VRA! Vote down the VRA!
to go to the polls tomorrow and vote down the VRA!
with an unprecedented number of people going to the polls.
that's why we need heroes -- to remind us
well, what father doesn't want to make his son happy?
I want to be a hero that helps give them faith in themselves
he followed you from his parallel world,
did you know Perry White started out
maybe people need to see my face, too.
I know how much it would kill you to watch your son die.
none of us is born to hate.
don't worry. I've been impressed with you for years.
I like to consider myself a longtime supporter
mom. Hi.
we love you, blur. We're always here for you.
that's why I came back here to find you!
was that, uh -- was that your idea?
back at the mansion
how can you be so good, Clark?
Lionel's rebuilding his empire with Lex by his side.
was Jonathan's happiness since he'd met me.
you should thank your mom and Perry.
I can't believe they'd risk coming out to defend me.
well, if you didn't green-light this garbage, who did?
I -- I didn't approve any of these articles.
you've grown up... Alexander.
the same man who successfully faked his own death.
try a couple hundred thousand...
and we both know this boy is sick and needs serious help.
you got a hug for your long-lost daddy?
but I'm not gonna let you go on a suicide mission for me.
a long time ago, Jonathan and I realized
you will rule our family dynasty...
which also makes you the same man who abandoned me.
but this really isn't your home, Lionel, is it?
you are a perfect fit for Clark.
you've already changed my life. Keep fighting, no matter what.
you should have stayed out of the spotlight,
Oh, gosh, your dad would be so proud.
interesting, because in my world,
that is a lie, Tess.
to provide for my family
because... You'll always be my son.
in order for the blur to be a true beacon of hope, it gives me hope that one day I can do the same.
is that what that was? - Are you making an accusation against my son?
so, you're saying I should become that hero and step into the light?
when the VRA is repealed and my name is cleared...
Alexander, would you leave us a minute, please?
with my help, you will succeed.
I'm willing to sacrifice the same thing your father did.
I destroyed the mirror box.
I don't know, but I'm gonna find him before you do.
I have all of Lex's memories.
I loved to give you presents.
I'm gonna scan traffic cameras to retrace his steps.
it doesn't matter what you wear or what name you go by。To Martha, with deep affection.
that explains the smell of old spice and young ambition.
if you're listening to this, blur, thank you for everything.
the kryptonite would tear through him.
Oh, my god, son, what have you done?
and then it hit me like a banner headline
and now it is my great honor to introduce to you
I'm here now to protect you.
are you okay?
but I also saw me -- I mean... Clark Kent
our heroes need our help now more than ever!
and now he's out there alone somewhere
protecting him suddenly became a much bigger responsibility.
I turned my back on you for someone who betrayed me.
the blur is a symbol for integrity and morality and selflessness.
Clark, you saw the world that Lionel built over there.
I wish that I could inspire him a little right now.
your father and I made a pact many years ago.
but Clark was the one that changed everything for me.
this is your home, Alexander.
no one does anything till I get back from the fortress.
Yes, well, rumors of my death...
and I know that I'm not perfect.
I betrayed you for that boy in another life.
pretty please?
Hello?
Yeah.
Yeah. Right.
I saved her.
from what the late Mrs. Jones said,
he killed her, Clark!
blayne.
Chloe's alive.
it's a dead end.
the Omega symbol.
they, uh...
we're just human.
Yeah.
let's get out of here.
I'm guessing.
here we are.
Yes, it is.
on vanilla-bean frosting?
the world needs to believe
he owns a nightclub he's using and the answer has literally
but not you.
come on.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know. I know.
Yeah.
how did you save my life?
we're the Joneses.
Chloe.
I was kidding myself
not me. Nope.
who uses that stamp.
for a gallon of milk.
maybe that's where they took her.
Oh.
I only saw a few dots.
excuse me.
if we can't stop it,
what?
we're the...Joneses.
Yeah, sorry about the mess.
Yeah, I wanted to, starting with the heart.
there was an omega on his skull.
shut up. I'm serious. - I know.
Clark, I am sorry.
you're right, Lois.
can you trace it?
I know.
you don't know what to call me.
good.
their cover was blown, to put omegas on people's heads.
thank you.
Yeah, I'll be right down.
right this way.
the one with the -- - Robbery homicide.
across town for me?
Clark.
you get your cab,
marrying moi,
Yeah.
when you're calling from...
on your feet.
this thing is like an evil
well, the mucker here now.
Oliver.
go to hell.
okay.
Oh, this just keeps getting better and better.
right.
Yeah, no, I'd...
and at night, I won't be able
I don't know.
and humor me.
Yes.
to become the masked archer?
Mm-hmm.
it's another dead end, Lois.
Bert?
and I didn't get caught.
Yeah, um, listen, Bert?
they were on a stakeout -- FBI.
maybe that's what you wanted.
this isn't really what I had in mind.
it was a, uh, adrenaline thing.
too proud to face the fact
are you getting this?
it's me.
Hello? Who found you? Who is this?
I said enough!
there's plenty enough people here
Yeah, not today, anyway.
am I the only one who's confused here?
dead end? Seriously?
Business-suited cyber-savior?
Mr. Jones.
why do you still have this?
smack-dab in the middle of it.
Oliver.
sorry.
you clear their minds,
no.
to fight the good fight without us.
what would your boyfriend say about that?
and a girl with no identity
listen...
super.
did I just se
okay, but the only way for the rest of my life.
alone.
been staring me right in the face.
uh, no.
uh, that's debatable.
I'm pretty sure that is the blur.
and you're in a better condition?
Clark Kent!
Hey!
forensics said it was all right to come by don't even know is affecting them.
it worked, right?
Desaad.
who is this?
just before the facility exploded,
and you
and you are so close to the story
is it?
I don't want to deny who I am
that's what happened.
drink it in, handsome.
could have called me. You could have said
at least not really.
I know this line isn't secure, something that hero-haters like Slade
I can't even get on the list.
by doing exactly what we talked about, with me in his place, would you?
just died.
it's registered to an address on 4th street.
so, what do you think?
the business
before I sent it up there?
Chloe.
Oliver, what is it?
what are you doing?
Yeah, you're probably right.
I saw something on Slade's skull
you coming?
what do you have for me, Jeff?
all that effort you spent to see anything through these glasses.
my guess is...
Lois, let me call you back.
can we talk about this later?
what are you doing?
now, stay put.
and why don't you get me a good rate
you're so dramatic.
all right, all right, enough of this.
metropolis General Hospital
pride.
how would you be able to see that?
micro vision.
I would expect nothing less.
they are offering a national commendation
look up in the sky.
that's spreading over the earth.
had you going for a second, huh?
to none.
come on, Chloe. We can be together.
or er, Agent...?
Clark Kent, Daily Planet.
okay.
shouldn't he be in yank land?
Yeah.
no.
we've shut down granny's orphanage,
Jeff.
you know I'd catch you.
keep in mind that it's a prototype, okay?
and now he's got Chloe...
okay?
No! No! No, I did not forget
you know when something happens,
sorry.
okay, driver, we don't care for a relationship!
where the hell is she, huh?!
than you ever have in the spotlight.
a lie.
heroes hidden no more
what's happening?
Oliver, what happened?
from the look on your face, who was a visitor at this club.
x-ray vision for the shades.
and now Ankara's also wondering
there's a photo in there of a guy named Desaad.
well, don't leave goldilocks out in the cold.
What'd you guys do with Mrs. Jones, huh?
they probably couldn't break their cover
that Clark Kent is way too normal to ever be...
I've been working faster than usual.
shut up.
kill me.
the hood's not gonna stay up during superspeed...
turns out he wasn't the only one.
let me run away with you this time.
he was covering his tracks.
terrific. - Wait a second.
you know, when I said I wanted to spoon earlier, that you might wind up finding yourself
well, you wouldn't want to have dinner
I mean, I heard he's a pretty tough guy.
your brown-haired rendezvous here
the darkness.
and I'll just superspeed off all on my own...
and it's not any worse than machine-gun fire.
Oh, you might balk,
I am Green Arrow.
so what? You're just gonna put me.
I bind their bodies.
after the V. R.A. shut down, but...
because I would just sound racist.
that's only a fraction of a centimeter.
Desaad?
enjoy.
that's why I've been so reluctant.
that the world moved on without us.
you envy what we have.
gets a little less mysterious
Thanks, Bert.
I think that counts for something.
if I adjust my behavior when I use them? I know.
you know, I heard he lost his company
did I miss something?
okay. Oliver! Come on.
call it a hunch.
I'm...I'm afraid I'm gonna
I mean, my place...
we just wiped the floor with their backup.
okay.
don't be modest.
no, what you don't understand.
this isn't happening.
right now, I don't have a choice.
Oliver.
chap thinks he's the blur.
just tiny Martha?
that's why we have to get out of here.
it preys upon the dark side that we already have.
I thought I lost you.
we were just about to ask you the same thing.
and even though we've silenced Godfrey,
we'll find a way to make it work.
and at his checkup the next week...
no one's answering up front.
I'm quite enjoying myself.
it matches the stamp right there.
I gave it all away.
you're upset and in no condition to go up against the darkness.
I've been doing this all wrong.
when you're superspeeding, and...
and tell me how you feel.
Mr. And Mrs. Jones weren't married at all.
I asked my name to be taken off.
and buried Desaad underneath belle reve,
we can resist any temptation,
whoosh!
Vactor. And whoever you are, but we don't even know where to start.
I just have to turn off some of this equipment.
we need to get back to the Joneses'
okay.
Lois...
Ah. I'm the guilty one.
tell me, Chloe
hands where I can see them!
and follow up on the mass-grave story.
she suffered a system-wide hemorrhage,
whatever it is that we're -- wow.
I think the omega is a sign of corruption
from the number of bodies,
Oliver Queen could waltz in here right now,
if he'd just stand still long enough to receive it.
Lois, you've had a lot of questions about the blur.
and I won't even bother with the Chinese.
I thought I lost me, too.
Chloe...
get out of my head!
my Turkish is a little rusty,
Clark, the blur can't just whip out a new costume at work!
when I'm out there in the red and blue and you let him take that limo of his back home...
unfortunately, I've lived my entire life
did the rest of the bodies have this?
makes you wonder what kind of person could do such a thing.
these just came in from Bert in Forensics.
so if there's anything that you have to say...
how bad is it?
if the darkness has anything to do with this,
what do you mean, ma'am?
come on.
don't worry, Mr. Jones.
and I know this is gonna sound weird,
that's easy for you to say
that was supposed to go out two days ago.
you weren't joking around at the restaurant, were you?
sadly...
Really?
what are you talking about, Clark?
Yeah, and the last thing we want up until this point without needing one.
just like Godfrey.
I know.
they, much like I,
Hello?
looks like a serial killer.
one kiss.
to what happens halfway around the world.
I think there's something more behind the darkness,
just running some errands.
you all right?
can't go through that again.
she's either damned or dead.
what the hell is that?
it probably has to do with center of gravity.
we've got a serious problem here.
you're sweet.
you know what I am.
miss Lane, I'm working as
Hello? You hear me?
love to do that, if there is a later.
risotto cheese bites?
but you weren't answering your cell.
you really don't see this?
I love you. -I love you.
you really need to watch where you're going, buddy.
but I'm gonna be in the spotlight
okay
and do you want it back?
never.
but the fate helmet warned me to stay away.
we're the Joneses, the two of us.
which is why it's our job to get Mr. Jones out of it.
the universe just gave a guy with a secret
that is so you!
nice eye.
it was like it was branded there.
but they had no idea what they were getting themselves into.
Yeah, it's owned by a guy named Desaad.
no one at the morgue recognized the name "Blayne."
he really didn't have a clue.
Ollie, something's wrong with Clark.
you know, if they hadn't found the bodies
we don't have to try so hard to be heroes.
when yearbooks come into play, right?
that was delicious.
all it takes is one wrong person
huh?
envy.
suddenly doesn't want the credit?
that shouldn't be a problem.
looks like a serial killer.
table for the Joneses?
nice try...
well, just use a bobby pin for the hood
what is gonna happen if people start thinking
come on.
Yeah, look, we shouldn't be doing this.
someone did this to these people.
well, he probably can't even leave the house
every one of those x-rays belongs to someone
so I got a question for you.
does he now?
we are stronger than that, aren't we?
when people see this adorable blonde
who America's blur hero is.
but oh, my god. Right?
Clark.
we're lying alone together in the dark, okay?
too proud to ask for help.
I've just been so wrapped up in all of this,
I will not take a life, period.
through the seven deadly sins house of horror,
you talk like a cop, you walk like a fireman.
do you remember who else didn't want to wear a mask?
hell of a way to spend an anniversary, right?
we spend every waking moment together, right?
look, I understand I got a little enthusiastic
I'm not gonna stop saving people.
you sticking around for a while?
Yeah, I'm a little bit bigger than you, and, um...
don't worry about it, Mr. Kent.
but not you.
the chance to enjoy an evening out in public.
when I'm out there doing what I was born to do.
Chloe!
I escaped the villain of the piece - Oliver. - Oliver made his own choice.
matches the number that Mrs. Jones called from.
some guy from the bureau came in here for a little bit of relaxation,
she's safe.
a mark that the darkness has fully taken over someone.
I'll be damned.
it's not the last time that we've seen Darkseid.
you saved my life.
but he wouldn't have the luxury of eating in peace.
does forensics have any leads?
look, Clark, I want to plan this wedding
we've said our "I love yous" how many times, huh?
Yeah, I really should get to work.
the important thing is I made the save
the feds have been keeping an eye on it for weeks.
must have been some sort of relief pattern.
I'll try to be more careful next time.
and the stamp was made for an anonymous private buyer.
thank god.
wait.
I've always wound up defining myself
and then I erased it all.
which means if we can't find her,
you are going global now,
a prophet.
you know who pays the power bill around here, right?
but is that really the life you want for yourself?
you know the real bitch of this whole thing? Mm-hmm?
you know, I don't spend much time paying attention
well, her.
when we could be saving the world?
what if we missed our chance?
several. What do you call that?
this is a-a bakery.
you might as well put an "S" on your chest. Ha!
and I'm saving people, that's who I really am.
have been burning your omega symbols in innocent people.
wait.
now stop trying to dodge this bullet, speedy-pants.
not just to you but to the whole world.
Yeah, he's -- he's right.
I think that's a definite.
good job, Mr. Kent.
whatever it is that we're doing.
beat him at his own game.
all I did was change it.
to let someone like you get away.
would you like my advice?
I don't know -- working here and...
and crank up the average joe?
get a table just like that, no problem.
I just stopped looking for you.
I should have known the pressure you were under
looks like they were dumped as recently as a few hours ago.
heck, you beat us to most of our own crime scenes.
it's just a word.
thank you.
a little on the nose, don't you think?
freeing yourself from your old identity,
I know how hard you worked to disappear,
you have no idea what you're dealing with here.
you are sticking your neck out farther than you have before.
I've been drawing too much attention to myself.
Hello, dear.
is there... Anything else you need?
so if we want to save Mr. Jones, we need to find him,
weren't you at that crime scene the other day
real enough for you to wonder
I-I'm fine.
is for a billionaire superhero ex-fugitive
and that's why I have never questioned without wearing some kind of ridiculous disguise.
he says you're lucky to be engaged to such a super guy.
do you know how many tiny Clark has on his?
I know who you are.
and I will stand by you no matter what, okay?
why don't I just save you the trouble,
Mr. Jones.
Lois and I are trying to find a serial killer
and no more disguises, no more darkness.
please tell me you didn't hop across the pond
Clark Kent will be the mask.
it was only a matter of time before I made a mistake.
is everything all right, ma'am?
well, we were lucky this time.
as much as I want to jump off of a building.
Hello?
but I'm stronger than that.
you got some explaining to do.
try and convert me into one of your dark denizens?
I would never ask you to do that.
so, what do we do now?
flashes of you and I?
what makes you think I'd be in England?
me? No.
and go from there?
I think that's why I've been struggling
over here.
and I'm really happy to hear it, but...
you just have to act like you're miserable, though.
Godfrey breaks their spirit.
wait a minute. What is this?
makes it, uh, pretty hard to live a normal life,
take a look at these crime-scene photos.
but there's a stamp on each of the victims' hands.
that the glasses are ever going to work
you're trying to tempt me.
if you want to keep doing things like
and suddenly you're afraid that you can never go back?
leaving with Ollie would be sloth.
come on. Again?
Oliver went from having two identities to one...
the coroner couldn't make a connection between the bodies.
the love I feel for you.
we sure this is the right place?
preparing the way for Lord Darkseid.
cause I am who I am.
what else do you call it when you have zero leads?
you just... Have to admit it.
who are you?
Yeah, I appreciate your concern
you do not get to whoosh your way out of this one.
how is that so many bodies go for so long without being found?
the last thing I want is for you to get caught in the cross fire.
serial killer.
but I wouldn't want to ruin the surprise.
it's time I stopped hiding from that.
is next on the list.
I...I don't see how we're gonna make this work.
not in so many words.
sooner or later, someone is gonna put two and two together.
that is a pretty amazing breakthrough.
that shirt-and-tie Clark has what it takes to save the day?
which means Mr. Jones is probably in grave danger.
it's okay.
he's an agent of the darkness...
had a pen pop earlier while I was taking notes.
Oh, gee, you forgot?
you're under arrest for impeding a federal investigation.
how would you feel about negotiating a deal
you know all about me.
you know, the whole "woman who doesn't exist thing
about the arrangements that you made. We just
you, uh...
I don't want to wear a mask.
girlfriend sounds kind of high school...
a dwp worker stumbled across them
just take my hand.
that it's been a year since we started doing...
she screamed for you as she died.
what makes you say that?
I think our audience would like some answers.
Oh, god.
I mean, this is the face of the man that my parents raised.
but it's not what I'm called that should define who I am.
he must be killing the people he can't convert.
the coroner wasn't examining those bodies, Lois.
Ohh. Mr. Kent, I'm sorry.
hell to pay if the boss finds out I've been slacking off.
you're damn right.
what exactly are you, Desaad?
you know, the Joneses may have gotten made,
darkness.
flashes that you never expected?
but what if we're doing it to save our own souls
and I don't understand why you aren't more concerned.
phone call from your wife,
I made this bed...
I can't believe you would think I would want that.
you'll be joining her soon enough.
Chloe.
good girl. Stay strong.
tiny Martha is a sign of a much larger problem.
as my dad's battalion is a recipe for disaster.
it's the face of the man that you love.
even with the registration act behind him,
no matter what happens...
well, I can't exactly call him my boyfriend.
it's the heart, actually
we know you aren't the Joneses. Who are you?
you're much more self-assured now.
Bravo.
our control issues,
I lost someone. She meant everything to me.
where the hell are you, anyway?
I think I might.
did you know that average fiance "Smallville." I must be in trouble.
probably someone who really enjoys it, too.
I am a positive, supportive, independent woman,
after all those years, don't you want to know?
all grouped together like that, I'd say natural causes, but...
you know what? I know how important what you do is
like hell.
no, your sin is ripe for the picking.
good things come to those who wait.
I think whoever the real Mr. Jones is,
why would you ever think that I would
what's the worst that could happen?
sandwiching your superfriends into the same place
no. It'll be here soon enough.
and I should be wearing a mask.
now I have to sleep in it.
now stop giving me excuses...
tiny Lois has 37 possible guests on her side.
sin is a liability I exploit.
this is definitely the most romantic of my recent kidnappings.
that's why we vanished without a trace.
and I just want to know what happened at the morgue.
the guy who left his calling card across the globe to get caught kicking in the front door of a sex club.
the world still knows him as the Green Arrow.
you gave up everything that I have,
um...I haven't felt like Chloe.
which is...awesome, frankly, until they found out how we were connected to the missing agents.
if so, there might be a connection we can make between
you probably should.
to Darkseid.
I spell checked it twice.
then why bother with the jacket, Clark, the symbols?
I think Oliver Queen would be an absolute fool but it's worked for me for a very long time.
Hello! - He found me.
but I'll be ready...
meanwhile, in Buenos Aires, the window to the soul.
meaning what? You, uh...
well, is it always so bad being someone else?
you aren't real, either.
that better be some pretty damn good milk, smallville.
well, it's my power. I can call it whatever I want.
and whether you like it or not, you've made one, too.
and not made things more difficult for you.
come on. We never have to tell anyone.
I'll try not to take too much of your time.
you know, Jeff, um, it's my fault.
hiding in plain sight.
in an abandoned tunnel just beneath here.
the whole world is starting to wonder who the blur is,
I am the blur, and I always have been.
to suddenly give everything over for something lesser
if that's what it takes to be the hero the people need...
I am getting really tired of excuses here.
should we just serve up hot charcoal, too?
feels good, doesn't it?
our unholy trinity is complete.
what'll they call you?
thank you for your time, Blayne.
you know, roll it around in your mouth for a minute
as in...?
when you get these flashes going through your mind,
Lois Lane. Will you marry me?
I am so sorry, Mr. Kent.
you know, I'm supposed to be meeting someone here
you know what I'm capable of.
Yes, Miss Lane, I am.
Chloe, listen.
to, uh...Lionel Luther.
to define myself against you.
I have been so many things over the years
Oh, you know, cause I'm kind of staring at your face online.
I thought I was, um...
Oliver Queen, of all people.
I think it's only fair if I get to know you a little better.
that's our hubris, our fatal flaw.
who is this? Who found you?
Mr. Jones, we've been looking for you.
feeling lost, Chloe?
but it seems someone managed to pull off a supersave there,
well, you don't have to do it alone.
makes me wish I was someone else entirely.
Clark Kent -- it's... It's just a name.
the darkness will infect every person on this planet.
you act as though the marks weren't there to begin with...
last call for the Joneses!
with nary a mark on my bones.
but knowing that doesn't change how you feel.
recognizing the right face, and bam!
so you're willing to dial back the hometown hero
doe-eyed sleuth, intrepid reporter, watchtower
we should, uh... Introduce ourselves.
and you are -- on this adorable blonde's arm...
because it was fuzzy, but it looks so much like you.
uh, I'm pretty sure Mrs. Jones, uh...
Yeah, they're kind of a bread crumb.
took me a while to figure out Chloe's weakness...
there were no omega symbols on the bodies in the morgue.
I feel like I can't believe that you did this to my jacket.
have you seen that viral clip of the blur from London?
let their ladies take them to cake tastings?
and Clark's kiss is lust.
I think it's high time that we got you a new disguise.
and that is just the beginning.
the blur is not the disguise, Lois.
it's who I am that should define what I'm called.
I didn't realize you were ready for your close-up.
to be better than all of those that fell before him.
you are more vulnerable than you think.
let's start with "girlfriend
stronger than when you faced granny, as well.
the visions tend to cut to the heart of the matter.
our grossly disproportionate sense of independence.
no. I have only ever been happy for Lois and Clark.
more love in your heart than when you faced Godfrey.
lose the last little bit of me that I have left.
you're trying to get me on wrath now, huh?
if you will ever feel the happiness that Clark and I do.
you, sir... Are a hero.
by some group or cause or other person.
others require a little persuasion.
most of you are quite easy to turn, but...
sadly incorruptible.
I was wondering when we'd meet again.
you've grown just as useless as that knife.
a servant, loyal to a far greater power.
I'm sure I won't feel like one in the morning.
I found them, but I don't think I have much longer.
your friends will all die if you don't.
have been preparing for something... Amazing.
giving up my identity by coming out, but, uh...
well, Chloe 1. 0, anyway, since...
Yeah.
what?
Yeah, tell me about it.
metropolis Fortune Casino
okay!
you don't understand.
it's actually not bad.
got it? - Yeah.
Clark.
we'll have their number.
Hey, you know what?
how the hell did we end up here, anyway?
well...
Yeah, I can activate
Lois?
monkey.
thank you, sir.
not Clark.
not in this lifetime.
to get you that ring back, okay?
problem solved.
no.
Yeah, yeah, you did.
Emil!
I mean, are you made of steel?
break him.
you're looking
Yes, she will.
don't move!
thank you very much. Gentlemen...
um, I'm looking
you haven't ruined anything.
Yeah, right.
Hey, big daddy.
which is a bummer,
well, I mean... said, "I do"?
...I hope it's not
Lois...
I always knew
and I'm gonna call Oliver,
all my prenuptial bliss
it's just the business.
Hey, hey!
okay, okay, okay!
undo.
well, no surprise there.
Bravo, sir.
he reports the crime,
I know.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Yeah, but all I see
I waited my whole life and a different kind of handsome.
Clark!
God, I feel terrible.
Lois?
but you really -- you got to relax, all right?
Where's your phone?
there's an armored-car company
and I know no matter what,
me too.
as to where we were last night.
your little card shark here?
it could have affected all of us.
Oh, look at that.
Oh, I have no idea.
Ta-da!
okay.
and it's from Lois.
back atcha, hot stuff.
that is not where
she's one of the crew that stole the money!
after all the years that I've known you,
so reckless.
let me tell you something.
no. Stay.
you know, I can't
tell you what -- I'm gonna do whatever it takes she went to Egypt.
that was stolen last night.
it's hard to explain.
and I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
Oh, you can't handle what I got.
okay.
Yes!
down at the police station.
my corporation -- I may have lost it,
you look great.
do you have any idea...
the morning after mind is a stinger.
when I -- when I changed my pants,
not to mention the fact
you see that pole over there?
and from their security footage,
don't say the word "consummate."
I mean...
and we're gonna shuffle over there
any luck on that armored car it looks like I stole?
then it could have affected Oliver.
check it out. Check it out.
you know what I'm saying?
I thought my drunken-blackout days were behind me. This is...
but in that green getup of yours, or you're not 100% sure
you know, in every epic tale,
a little tied up right now.
there's no sign of a driver.
linking them to this casino
no, it's not that.
Yeah!
Chloe?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, here.
if Zatanna's mind-wipe affected you,
and, uh, we're gonna call Clark.
well, we're two different
Clark, the nanosecond technology that they use,
she bet her engagement ring, yeah.
it's just...
but at least I can make a sentence.
was I scammed?
my no-longer-engaged hand.
in all my globe-trotting,
Lois, you're still engaged.
do you know where the power? - Yeah,
I'm not twitching. There's something stuck in my bra.
what happened?
go. Go.
I think the jury's still out, but, uh...
the symbol of our future together.
and care enough to give me the ring.
let me tell you something.
so he won the ring of her.
we don't have much time.
to the bride and groom.
watch this.
Clark!
means Emil could be in danger.
no. No, we wouldn't, uh --wouldn't do that.
Oliver, I - It's okay.
when she found out I was the blur,
wait a minute. That's it.
monkey?
no Emil.
I got a text message from last night
you're safe now.
I thought I'd be spending the entire night
you may just have to let go of the ring.
Hey, listen, I got a question for you.
dressed like the top of a wedding cake.
Thanks.
I have no memory of what happened last night,
Hey, watch it, buster!
are not gonna give Lois the wedding jitters.
was if it was a sure thing.
okay...
Hey, you know what?
cheat me out of my happiness forever after.
nice masks, boys.
champagne. - Oh, no. Absolutely not.
this $500 baby here, means we were probably gambling last night.
but, you see, that's what they all say.
to the bride and groom! Cheers!
being engaged to walking perfection?
please forgive me.
he wasn't drinking. He'll have answers.
I mean, what are the odds, huh,
I thought I told you gentlemen
I need your help.
you should really ease upon yourself, Lois.
you're starting to do that twitchy thing again.
way to go all-in, gorgeous.
it's...
stay!
that you're gonna run off without your husband.
you don't need to explain.
Yes!
one of those infamous phone booths of yours, okay?
it looks like it might be the same one
uh, excuse me.
want to give this girl some love?
I got it.
well, we're not.
one night, he's already famous.
what is this?
I think I forgot all the important things.
...and a bit lonely.
still searching for missing vehicles.
good morning.
I'll call you after I find our friends.
fighting crime next to walking perfection?
you got the wrong Elvis.
when things got real between us.
but I'm gonna buy you an identical rock, okay?
I don't think I've ever seen you this happy.
we cannot tell Clark!
we'll still be in each other's lives.
the fact that you took my money
I do.
Emil.
and...
it's you.
doesn't mean they're connected causally.
business?!
hugs, Zatanna.
I do believe it's fair to say that they lost a vehicle last night.
why don't you go take care of that?
was just a drunk prank. So...
both... Did the deed? Oh, god.
okay. Shh.
I hate to break this to you, but the last thing
Chloe, run!
it's okay. It's all right. You know what we're gonna do?
into thin air.
Chloe?
but was gone when I picked you up.
Ta-da! - Yeah!
whoa. Hey, Chloe, look.
Oh, my camera. Of course.
for the girl that came in here with me last night.
look, if all this wedding mess
Clark.
I still have to break it to Oliver,
Why? What's the problem, huh?
to find somebody who would get this wacky world view
are you really made of steel?
all right.
and the first thing I do is go and lose it.
I'd say we just survived the world's greatest bachelor party.
Oh, look at you. - Oh, no.
Oh, I don't think that would happen, Lois.
complete with a memory erase.
she was there when I dropped you off
here comes the bride.
think I just got an idea of where to start.
that's a relief. - Yeah.
Ah, Lois, we're gonna find them, okay?
we have a winner!
I forgot that I
he's gonna understand, Lois. He always does.
well, Emil always was an overachiever.
sorry! Oh.
to support you
by day, of course.
you are.
except this time,
I want to go around with for the rest of my life
I'd like to introduce you to somebody.
do you have any idea how much pressure there is
I will understand.
get her! Get her!
you're free. All right, let's blow this pop stand.
Thanks, man.
Yeah. My cellphone's gonzo, too
you know what? I just realized something.
we'll be lucky to get out of here alive.
Oh, god!
you know, us Lanes can usually hold our liquor,
I know.
Hey! Easy does it, sweetheart.
I hope you're right.
watch this.
she doesn't want to be found.
okay. All right.
is getting to be too much, then...
Oliver?
come with me.
there's a chain gang breaking rocks in my head,
unfortunately, the limo is here.
that's her. The blonde!
you really rocked this town.
what's his name?
we got some questions about an armored car
you all right?
Clark?
uh, Lois,
and you are not The King of Rock.
right, right -- we went to a costume party
no.
at the Chapel of Love.
you know that, right?
looks like your "get up and go-go" is long gone.
when they told me they were duped.
we're gonna stand out like a hooker in a church.
you're not thinking this through, okay?
Oh. Did I call it or did I call it?
okay, he can just hang tight in there
it appears to me that...
it's a fallacy.
I know better than that.
but I have a bit of a confession myself.
while we figure this out.
it's just, I...
don't give it up.
but I strongly suspect that inside this little puppy
I never thought I'd be that gal.
my engagement ring is gone.
if you're watching this 20 years from now,
that's great stuff. I'm real proud of you.
Wow.
in one, two, shuffle.
you're a comedian.
fortune Casino.
I thought I told you never to come back here again.
whoa. I can't, Chloe.
you know, to friends.
all right. Listen up, everybody. I have the smoking gun.
Clark, we are really married.
you are an eye full.
I thought that I'd scared you away somehow.
I did not want to be
get in line.
I was just checking out my single hand, - Everything's gonna be great. - Can't call clark.
the ring that Clark gave me was a symbol of our love, the truck's alarm system remotely, I think.
we're gonna need a get-out-of-jail-free card.
you still don't get it.
and goofy traditions in the world
she probably insulted you more than once.
kind of reminded me of the good, old days.
what did we do?
there's still one thing we have to do
was too good to be true. - It's working!
now, I haven't actually laid eyes on all the footage yet,
here, let me bring it up.
that this is the right thing to do,
let me tell you something, Tess.
I mean, I didn't believe these yahoos
I could have ripped my ring off his chubby little finger.
right?
there's no such thing in life as a sure thing.
I'm the one that convinced him to drink that champagne.
I hear it.
I wouldn't be caught dead in that thing.
probably see if this thing works. - Maybe I should
I forgot how well you know me.
if your wallet was on the hood of the car,
no. I think it's in good hands.
we're not leaving without my ring.
they'll be worried.
it was so much more than that, Oliver. - I know. I know.
where are you going?
when I woke up this morning and you were gone, just know that you are the love of my life...
but I made my decision.
which is weird, because alcohol normally doesn't affect me.
is yours truly.
let's just take a step back.
we're going there, okay?
a billionaire with high-tech toys at the Star City Register's newest hire.
first time I kissed her, she left town.
your Pointer Sisters just gave us our first clue
we're gonna, uh --we're gonna find
I was so close,
let me see that.
the ring is not what's important.
there is no way that I'm gonna let that creep
unless...
you know, maybe there's a number we can call.
knowing you -- blackjack, right? - That's my game.
no kidding. Huh.
finding heroes and helping them realize
Clark...
I don't know what you're thinking, but...
if Emil wasn't arrested...
just married.
but don't do anything I wouldn't do.
I've already been the ghost in the machine once.
Yeah. I can, too.
I should have known all this bridal hoopla - Come on! Hop in. - Thank you.
can you check their cellphone records or credit-card statements?
just because the two events are connected sequentially
What'd you do?
well, it was a nice surprise
Yeah.
since my wife passed away.
I won so big today.
this is not the first time that she has been bailed
Yeah, and when this happens to grooms over the world,
the only conceivable way that I would bet the ring
you two amazing people
this might be more difficult than I thought.
or the fact that you
so, no sign of Oliver,
who were those cops?
you're not alone, Clark Kent.
eh, big mistake
Hi...I think there's something missing.
well, wouldn't be the same without you being here. - Yeah?
we'd better drop a line to Clark and Chloe.
the only one getting lucky here tonight
Yeah, well, my memory is blank, too.
Yeah. That was you, smart guy.
I plead innocent to all charges!
never hurts to change it up a little bit.
she wouldn't have wanted you to.
that Emil's accused of stealing. - Can you track this?
that was the perfect thing to say.
I'm so gun-shy, I don't even know if I can try it.
it's not your fault, Tess. But what about Lois? What about Oliver?
Oh, yeah? What are you trying to say?
she deserves better than -- better than that.
you don't think that we... - Exchanged vows?
okay, okay, okay, we need to power it, but the power
Chloe, this killer headache is affecting my abilities.
listen, you're gonna lean against me, all right?
congratulations, Clark. You deserve a real party.
I have something, uh...
come on!
do something.
and I just tried calling the chapel of love -- no answer.
you're the heart and soul of watchtower.
you don't -- you guys
these are $20 rings out of a vending machine.
was documenting the entire evening.
that Lois knows that you are the proverbial one.
with this thing, I will be drinking free all night long.
Ohh! Clark.
Oh, my god. What if I bet the ring?
you put these other hothouse girls to shame.
Where's the money?
Oh, this is good. How about this one? Look.
it's just all this wedding stuff is very wedding-y.
nothing. - That's a woman's ring, all right?
everything from last night is a blank.
Yeah, I found them in the backseat. What's that?
that you gentlemen are not the authorities.
I got it this time.
these -- these are -- how much did this cost you?
but I won't let a hero give up his world for me.
a monkey!
somebody actually stole his money.
and then the insurance company doubles his money.
and no trace of his name in any of the police records.
are the answers to all of our burning questions.
and Clark's with Chloe -- he'll take care of her, too.
and you'll be eating those Blue Suede Shoes.
I may have one.
no, no, no! - Show me what you got!
my dream soiree would end waking up
Yes, come to mama, sweetheart.
Oh, speaking of spirits, you know what we should do?
no. No, wait. Oliver, this isn't possible
I've been thinking that's my true calling
fortune Showgirls!
do we know each other?
that throws the costume-party theory out.
Emil's in prison now because of me.
I didn't steal any armored car.
I can't -- I can't do it again.
come on. Let's go. I don't want to take you for another ride.
it wasn't just any ring -- it was the ring, the big kahuna.
that's not my territory anymore, all right?
is a lie propagated by my ex-boyfriend.
I'll check the other room. Try to blend in.
you can tell the judge how you made it vanish into thin air.
the bride waving her freak flag down the aisle, okay?
didn't realize this was a gift.
to see our mild-mannered doctor
Oh! And we're rolling!
let's get out of here.
but the sweet smell of sewage is clearing my head.
with being the king comes a lot of responsibility.
not really feeling your jewelry malfunction right now, you know?
Lois.
what are you doing?
Hey, hound dog.
Oh, uh, there's sparkling cider in the fridge
the facial-recognition from the karaoke security footage
no, no, no. You are connected, my friend.
well, all that sounds amazing...
I got through to the chapel, and they told me
I'm sorry! You said you were cold.
since this isn't exactly Mister Rogers' neighborhood.
have a special power of his own.
it was a fun ride while it lasted.
that you were destined for big things, Chloe.
who? ...- Lemur.
your bachelorette superpower-up!
my friend here -- she lost a ring last night.
his friends just rally around him and help make it all right.
the answer has to be no.
she used to love to hear me sing to her.
I can -- I can read between the lines.
where did you get those shirts?
in the end, everybody names names.
showed that the fake cops actually have criminal histories - Ta-da! - Yeah!
if you're having doubts deep down inside
except for the ring --never gonna take that off.
Yes, this is Clark Kent.
Chloe, you just got back.
I thought we were rendezvousing at your place later.
break it! You break it!
and now in order to get out of this high-stakes poker game,
I thought we were -- we were past that.
Chloe, I never expected you to sit up
you know, like the tower in Paris.
but I don't have a single memory of my big night.
Chloe, do you want to take this?
she's raking it in, trash-talking the boss.
Cha-ching. Well, that's a first.
we're all a mess, okay? Let's be fair.
pretty fancy smoke and mirrors that you pulled off.
Lois, there's nothing to forgive.
uneasy lies the head that wears the crown,
I was three-time champ at Fort Dix.
post hoc ergo propter hoc.
something I don't understand.
uh, what is this?
do you have any idea how much pressure there is
Lois and I are pretty good together.
okay, what if these are just costumes?
no offense, but speak for yourself.
cut it out. Give it over, baby doll.
is a hothouse full of chumps, suckers, and high rollers.
I don't know what burns me more
and besides that, weddings just aren't that scary.
commit a felony, and I and my friend in jail.
you didn't take a job in my hometown for nothing.
Mm! Mm-hmm. For you.
sorry. - Good morning. It's okay.
you ready for this?
it says, "I just need more time."
you have my wallet downtown?
What?! Whoa!
that is, if they work for this fearless fortune.
let me guess. Your boss stacked the deck, right?
I found it in a, uh, a puddle of champagne in the limo.
are you okay? - Yeah.
looks like half of a wedding certificate.
here's the thing, Clark. I, uh...
their true potential beyond the reach of watchtower.
she must have put a spell on these.
alcohol doesn't -- doesn't even affect me.
Clark, my swingin' single days have swung.
I'm but a humble entertainer. - Funny.
I know that I have the, uh, "Runaway girlfriend" thing to...
Emil Hamilton, can you step off the stage, please?
but oddly, Clark, very human.
which I am certain Zatanna has not charmed.
before we go Defcon 1 on this stag-party snafu,
are those Emil's pants?
I suppose that's supposed to be humorous?
holy matrimony -- that's my signature.
this is, uh, Dr...
in that ivory watchtower for the rest of your life.
you're beeping, Clark.
I just want you to know
um... I'm really feeling this.
I didn't exactly bring my Green Arrow gear to the bachelor party.
Hey, drink! Drink it! Drink.
that's not what I was imagining.
you took my lucky lemur.
I can't believe on my first drunken night out, I lose Lois,
just wish I could freeze this moment in time forever.
where you running off to so quick?
you're leaving again, right?
Yeah, but I can't be watchtower anymore.
look, I need some answers about what happened last night.
look, your relationship is at totally different level right now.
one more Elvis cover out of you...
I swear I will never bet you again. Mwah!
Yeah, but your new partner in crime's got you covered.
you trying to protect your friends, smart guy.
so, you have any second thoughts about your girls' night out?
Oh, there's I only one person that I know
and maybe it wasn't just a fluke with you.
missing one of the names.
a monkey!
you know you've always been much more than that to me.
but you'll be just as dead if you don't cough up the cash.
that the whole "Best friend masquerading as the bride-to-be
it's my sparkly little ball and chain.
and you always will be.
it's funny. It almost sounded like you were saying goodbye.
that's why I'm following your lead, Clark.
you know I'll always be here for you.
so you did have fun last night.
no, if my calculations are correct, it's a scam, right?
congratulations on surviving your boffo bachelor party...
I've created a double-identity for myself.
and my mouth tastes like armpit.
Clark, okay, all of the taffeta and lace
someone was trying to prevent a robbery, not commit one.
must be more than champagne in these bottles.
no, no, no, no, no, no. I got the right mug.
Oh, right. A toast. Sorry. Forgot that one.
listen, I already told you
well, luck be a lady tonight.
it was lady luck that brought you to me.
cuffed to a blow-up doll while wearing a dog collar, so...
with someone a little taller, darker, - And I'll meet you at the watchtower. - Okay.
there's my sparkly girl. Oh, come to mama.
what if all this finally got to her and it pushed her away?
as you begin your "happily ever after" adventure.
I bet the ring. I mean, I got it back, but...
and, uh, I hope you boys have fun tonight,
but then I saw it for myself.
that -- that you would be an overnight sensation and a wondrous woman who is gonna throw you for a loop.
looks like things got a little out of control.
Clark, listen for a high-pitched tone.
whoa, my head is pounding like a mosh pit.
have been the best friends I could have ever asked for.
the file's corrupted, but we'll see what we've got.
there's always one person who believes in the hero first
the one guy I counted on remaining sober.
you think I'm gonna you run off with my lucky ring?
Oh, I really wish I didn't understand the physics of this.
on the same night that I was looking for you?
and the million-dollar morning-after mistake.
was just one right click away from bridal apocalypse.
that's -- that's why Fortune had you robbing his truck.
so, uh, we should go. But before we do, um, a toast.
no. Clark would never lose his ring, okay?
I-I wanted this to be perfect, not my normal mess.
if I hadn't lied to you, and crossed every T.
I'm sorry.
now, you and I both know
I can help.
who like secrets.
what?
you're right.
because of my powers.
I can honestly say I have no idea without you realizing it?
from how people would react
no.
he was my closest friend,
and it's important to me and he's really freaked out.
he doesn't. He doesn't remember anything
you're...
Lois, because of me,
Tess.
we can send him there.
lesson one
put the ring on.
once and for all.
Hey! You!
so, how are you?
he needs our help.
this is 100 times better about the other side of the family?
we convinced Dr. Lamell that can help me now.
what are you doing?!
and very stupid.
trust me.
am I forgiven?
DNA analysis report
don't we?
are you kidding?
how I'm supposed to be feeling about this.
Hey.
are you, like, my dad?
well, me and the Blur.
that bear your signature.
over and out.
a-and ever since he's been changing,
Yeah, he could.
trying to scare me into thinking
he had a vial of my blood
be back in a few.
that was all Lex.
but I never appreciated with our little project.
I'll always be there for you.
I want you.
and have entered your blood stream.
how are you?
and, well, that's where we differ.
I've seen him on Red Kryptonite,
Conner, you can't beat yourself up.
normal is you.
Lois Lane.
what just happened?
Conner Kent.
good. Good.
that's gonna make it easier
it's time.
it put us both in danger,
you don't have to say it like that.
now, if you're threatening me,
I'll end up like a piece of meat?
we're gonna practice.
let me see you.
without a little bubbly.
maybe we do.
he lied to me. - Yes.
what? It's just...
because he's afraid of you.
nothing. - Nothing.
half of his DNA came from Lex.
and see what's underneath.
he's even had government lackeys
Where's Lois?
but it doesn't turn him into this!
it's laced with nano-trackers.
hope it's not too presumptuous,
what's with the slaughterhouse?
you were meant to become a god.
why I am the way I am.
what happened?
Tess, you shouldn't...
given the fact that you're here, when people get to know you.
if he had the right guidance.
it's not your fault.
fiancee, Lois Lane.
there's caffeine dealers in Metropolis.
who are you?
just hear me out.
w-wait.
remember who you are.
on this family reunion, you wouldn't have run right into Lionel's hands.
are you
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you
give me my son.
I-I'm like you.
I'll take care of you.
I want to do something.
I'm here to answer them.
what?
I was investigating Lionel.
I know I have a lot to learn.
we have been learning new things about him,
this is pointless.
Clark needs to act now.
but not anymore.
Oh, hey.
just to have you by my side.
for getting sloppy with his taxes.
my lawyers are drawing up papers
so we need to move him.
what if he was just as sloppy?
Hey! Don't move!
you're afraid of it. You won't go near it.
that's why he ran to me.
I know you're probably still reeling
if I didn't know any better,
Ah, yeah.
about that...
you didn't have to come all the way out here.
Lionel. - Don't worry about him.
let him go!
let's go, son.
you can talk Clark into getting rid of Lionel Luthor
you turned out pretty normal.
Tess.
no.
informed me that millions of dollars when he had a superpowered son,
we really need to...
I'm in total control. - Clark!
here?!
well, if you're gonna throw a penance party,
officer, stop her. She's a thief!
sorry!
all I've been doing is learning.
and I know you'll make the right choice
no.
you know what we should do?
luckily, they brought out the best in you.
for a bullet in the bonnet any day.
come with me.
I promise you...
because you're a Luthor.
this is my friend Conner.
okay, what's with all the cloak-and-dagger?
teach me character.
we need to call Clark and tell him
honestly...
okay.
Clark.
you're a threat to him.
had been funneled into this facility.
is it true you can't remember anything when you're protecting the people you love.
Conner, this is my...
if I misused them.
Oh, my god. Are
she's not yours anymore.
you know, we have a doorbell.
for him to take everything away from you,
Lois, all that matters is that we have a kid in the barn, the government sent him up the river
let's go home.
copies of all the official documents
it seems Lionel 2. 0 has dotted every I
I understand Tess is trying to protect me
considering everything that happened,
they've burrowed deep into your stomach lining
okay, well, if you say the other half is Tess,
I applaud your efforts...
I just... I just... I just feel like of Clark Kent and Lex Luthor?
that I find out who and what I really am.
I'd say that turning your back on your own
but you missed a spot.
you're wrong.
you are nothing like Clark!
welcome home.
Clark doesn't know I broke into your office.
no, no.
guide him.
that it is bad luck to start our lives together
no disrespect, but, uh...
you'll be an amazing father.
no, hold on, Chicken Little.
I'm not sure how nurturing it was
and if they rumble in the asphalt jungle,
Why?
I don't believe you.
this place isn't really much of a secret.
of Daddy dearest.
he'd give Lazarus a run for his money.
but I'm no Clark Kent.
I'm your father.
or cool gadgets, I do find that hard to believe.
you're not leaving?
growing up, being different,
we have kept him in the dark about who he really is.
that Conner is the genetic love child
well, considering I don't have any amazing powers ...Sound the alarms.
he doesn't feel like he belongs anywhere.
no.
I'm surprised you are so hell-bent
appreciate your hospitality, but, uh...
what have they done to you?
and that ring -- he's got to wear that ring.
that's why we have to learn how to control them.
and I found this.
we don't need Clark.
does he have your powers?
don Luthor is going all godfather on us.
won out in the end.
I don't think it's a good idea that he knows
you're trying to turn him into something that he's not.
he knows you betrayed him.
let him enjoy himself.
thanks for your help.
Hi.
now, you may think you scrubbed all evidence
don't you think it's time to let Conner know the truth
I expected more.
but that doesn't mean that you need to embrace it.
I mean, his resurrection is so ironclad, and it may bring out his inner angst a little, and Lionel knows that Conner's here.
there's a part of me that's Lex Luthor, too.
well, if you feel that way,
well, that's really P. C. Of you,
what's happening?!
I think she's just embarrassed, you know?
Yeah.
sometimes it's hard to know where to draw the line
now, we know it seems like a dead end,
that almost sounded like it wasn't a question.
you'd be surprised how much it doesn't matter
I always knew that my powers could cause harm
before they control us.
my dad...
that Lionel would have spent a pretty penny
if we can find a detail that he overlooked,
my parents were there every step of the way.
I prefer "brother.
how do you know about the Blur?
I would not let you go back to him.
we need to make you better.
if they found out what I really was?
very noble.
because he's going through this sort of metamorphosis.
what if he remembers something about me?
it's from my medical files.
would teach me how to control my abilities,
but I didn't see any champagne, and you should know
we're gonna stay here on the farm.
Conner, what are you? - Stop right there!
Oh. Well, it was the least I could do
Conner!
he's a danger to himself and everyone around him.
I need you to sign off on the byline by noon
Lois, the other half is me.
what did you find on Lionel?
Yeah.
Oh, I'd risk my own life,
you're scared of what you might find inside you!
cause you can't control me?
so, your name is Conner?
the only reason that Lionel wants you to wear that ring
I'm gonna officially write that family off for good.
we've got to find him.
I'm not like you, Clark.
it's nice to hear you're ready to learn.
thanks?
one of my, uh, crackerjack accountants
how do we know what Conner wouldn't love to be and prince can say he's that squiggly thing.
to hide the fact that he's from another world.
given the fact that in this world
the barn never looked better.
classes start after spring break.
like you were all alone.
CNR. Conner.
and Lionel Luthor's influence destroyed him.
I was just stopping by to see how things were going,
I don't think I'd be the best mentor for him.
uh, he's soaking up new information
I can't let you take that risk. I'm sorry.
right. Okay. Um...
to protect those you love.
like an MIT graduate, a-and I think...
and that's you.
find out what my son is really made of.
me?
from bore you got your abilities?
she doesn't think that way.
it proves that you are a fake.
from the Conner bomb that I dropped on you this morning,
get in. I'll save you.
I'm nothing like you.
okay, let me make this perfectly clear.
we need to draw a line in the sand, Lois.
taking care of a walking freak show.
is so he can corrupt and control you.
I was trying to unleash his dark side,
you're lying.
I'm at the top of my game.
because that's not who I am.
when Eliot Ness couldn't nab Capone for murder,
I'm gonna call Oliver and Chloe in Star City.
you're right.
he's a genetically engineered version of Lex.
if they hadn't been such amazing parents,
I know you're here.
but you need to learn how to control them.
come, son, please.
I'll keep you safe.
if this isn't romantic enough,
red Kryptonite, if worn, Cognitional neuroplastic replicant
but I'm having some G-men turn over that rock
I'm saving him from an encore performance
I would have done precisely as he did.
that might look like a glint of pride in your eyes.
Conner.
wait, you still have some things you need to learn.
but I'm worried about what's underneath.
I need to find out where I come from, - Thanks, Conner. - Hope it wasn't too fast.
even though I was trying to save you.
including the woman he's with now.
when Lionel gave you up for adoption.
more than my own flesh and blood.
come on. I don't need to practice.
this world could've been a much darker place.
what the hell? I have been trying to call you.
Yes.
he has us.
Alexander?
and I'll make you happy.
why would I do that?
so my boy is alive.
but it looks like I should have brought marshmallows.
I'd like to.
that's fine, thank you!
Oh, believe me, I'll trade a little motion sickness
this isn't who you really are, Conner.
I lifted the tractor without any practice.
since the Lionel Clark knew came around in the end,
Clark is my world!
I'll speed us away to Paris...
he's only half lex it turns out.
besides, you can't exactly stop me.
when you put it down, you broke the beam behind the stall.
there's no discrepancies. Everything matches perfectly.
we'll live here happily ever after.
not for long.
I thought I was the only one with these powers.
I'm sorry that...
S-someone like you.
you need something more powerful than hot air.
unfortunately, uh, Clark, I just talked to my inside man,
what if someone catches on to the fact that you're different?
okay, well, I guess, if puff daddy can become diddy
okay, I-I get it now.
Conner, you may not have parents, but you have me.
Tess keeps me on the move.
but you don't understand what it feels like this kid has no chance of having a normal life.
I'm
my DNA, my handwriting
see? I'll get you anything you want.
reissue every official document with his autograph.
your son is in there.
are you him? The Blur?
look, his name is not the only thing that changed.
that's why we practice.
Clark is hoping this Luthor will change his spots, too.
so, does this mean
Clark, memory wipe or not, this kid tried to kill you.
I know you already went up this hill and got shot down.
to make up for all the trouble I caused.
is the dominant Luthor trait...
the longer he's exposed to it, the more unstable he becomes.
I'm sure you have questions.
enjoy the view one last time.
your neon is flashing red-hot, and I didn't see the sign.
I don't want your help! Or your lies!
you wanted to know what it means to be a Luthor?
but we both know...
great men -- great passion.
Clark could go down for the count.
everything that we do with our abilities is our responsibility.
then why would you have them all secretly reissued?
and become the hero you're destined to be.
I'm fine, thanks.
so I searched every Luthorcorp facility,
so it's not just the Luthor males
Lois, I understand that I'm asking you to take on a lot.
well, I'm ready now.
I can't stand around here milking cows
after he engineered Alexander, he thought that my DNA
he's with Clark Kent.
I feel like I stepped into a Tom Clancy novel.
Hey, Tess. Check it out.
I don't want to be better.
Yeah, it's exciting to have new abilities.
I'll be waiting. Right here.
considering what happened to me,
you don't scare me.
I've never felt better.
it's... it's just that t-there has been a little incident
but how is Lex able to shake up a human/krypto cocktail
Oh, god! Oh!
because you are inferior.
and as you know, just like our worlds, they're reversed.
you'll get it eventually.
I picked up an application for you to Smallville High.
or how it would affect you.
and it's all thanks to Clark.
Conner!
I overheard Clark say it.
I've read about every save he's made -- er, you've made.
because you realize if he knew, I'd destroy him.
you're not yourself! It's the ring! It's the ring.
but I shouldn't have been so quick to trust Lionel.
the responsibility they must have felt in raising me.
well, come on. Let's go to Metropolis and save somebody together!
to Tess that you stick around here for a while.
it's always in there.
deep down...
I know who I am.
I won't let you hurt him like you did Lex.
from a whole bunch of stuff, but...
I am a Luthor, and this is where I belong.
you used it on Conner, didn't you?
Conner has.
we don't have a choice.
it seems to me that Clark Kent's nature and nurture
together, we can make sure you do.
eliminating the one person who stands in the way of your destiny.
a-and ready to enter the real world.
but you can't hide Alexander from me forever.
safe from myself?
every time you meet someone new, some new doctor,
but you're the only member of our merry little league
no one will find us here.
it's one of the drawbacks of being like us.
Conner? Lois?
I'm sure she'll tell you when you're ready.
I'm not the Lionel you knew.
okay, Conner, something strange is happening to you.
you're not welcome here.
Lois! What is she doing here?
get your hands off me.
I made a terrible mistake, Tess.
Tess thinks she's kept that a big secret from me.
the tracking device in it will keep him on our radar.
are you sure you got it tight enough?!
which is why he is outside waiting in the car.
or somewhere where Clark will never find us.
you risked your life for him.
there's no place for him to hide.
all the firepower I need is right here
who taught you how to do all this stuff?
you decide who you really are.
the Lionel I knew never got blood on his hands.
it's your birthright.
I will crush you.
of your true identity from this world,
I lost my temper.
to tell us that Mercer took him to Smallville.
it's our destiny.
uh, Lois...
and his entire house of cards will come crashing down.
zip. Mutation's a bitch.
now the journey begins.
I know you can't understand, but I'm trying to keep you safe.
if, uh, they're gonna hate you just for who you are
you're the one hiding a mutant under your roof.
but what that ring brought out in me
I would give anything, my son, we could prove that he's a fake...
except he needs... he needs someone to...
I mean, maybe on the outside with what I can do,
because you're a terrible liar.
are you trying to tell me...
Oh. Oh. Doesn't compare to the value of rubies, when there's so much I need to know.
you had no idea that he would use Red Kryptonite on you
Thanks. But I think you have the wrong idea, Romeo.
well, I was raised to believe that you risk everything
he believed that all the hard work he had me do brings out the primal, uncensored core of self.
from now on, I will know your every move.
and if he gets ahold of Conner, he will do the same here.
you know, he's getting things faster than I did.
Clark, we don't know what he's capable of.
I wasn't the only thing that he left at the orphanage.
no, I knew when I signed up for the Clark Kent tour package
no. You're here because if you scream, no one will hear you.
he left his fingerprints on a document when he admitted me.
we belong together.
because of that scotch that you're drinking.
we should toast our future together.
sometimes I forget that you never saw what it was like...
that relinquish your complete control of Luthorcorp to me.
Clark Kent wants to keep it away from you.
ever since Alexander's reboot, he has been totally glitch-free
I should never have trusted Clark
that means a lot coming from you.
when Conner disappeared, I knew you couldn't be far,
I'm gonna have to unwrap my own mea culpa.
his first crush.
it was Lex that sent Lionel plummeting to his death.
but he has one thing I don't have...
identical to the other Lionel.
no one will ever take him away from me.
just concentrate and light the candle.
Conner's not alone.
Oh, Alexander.
if we're gonna make the evening edition.
guess I should start with fixing that fence out back.
which is why the Luthor legacy ends with you.
you'll always be a Luthor.
than playing lab rat for a bunch of doctors.
it was in your files, what they'd done, but I'd kill to protect my son.
if I'd been your father
your son is dead, Lionel.
not telling him the truth.
there was one document that you were never aware of.
I promise, she's trying to protect you.
no. You'll never take my son.
I'll open up a world Clark can't even imagine for you.
you must embrace your future.
I've read a great deal about you.
feeling like an outsider, like a freak...
there's a reason Lois Lane is known for telling the truth.
they think I can't hear what they say about me.
you'll never be able to hurt him again.
and if I can't have you, neither will he!
he's only the person you think he is because he has you.
but I refused to believe it.
this is the other side of you. This is Lex.
Lois, you don't understand. It never goes away.
half his DNA c-came from you.
but we both know how Lionel destroyed his own world
I'm sure when we have kids of our own...
this Juliet is already spoken for.
that will prove that I'm telling the truth.
well, technically, you are his sister.
sorry, but it's my risk to take.
why don't you have me killed?
the cremated remains came from one of the other clones.
you know, I have a newfound respect for my mom and dad.
but you are forgetting I'm running Luthorcorp now.
there's a shadow inside of all of us.
what do you say we take another shot at your heat vision?
and those same lies brought Conner to me.
or maybe even be jealous that they can't do what you can do.
okay, Alexander is now Conner?
you and I -- not happening.
you and I haven't had a chance to really catch up lately.
the only thing that's ever made me feel...
stolen from Helen Bryce's office years ago.
the only kid on the block more powerful than a locomotive?
no, it's not. And you're coming home with me.
Lionel knows his secret. He knows what can hurt him.
look, it's important...
but I figured you needed a last name.
together, we could have ruled this world.
um, he doesn't just have Lex's genes.
then you poisoned him with Red Kryptonite.
you know what? That's sweet. But I'm freezing out here.
would stop the accelerated mitosis, and it worked.
we thought we destroyed it, but Lex must have kept a sample.
security's on their way up to escort you out of the building.
that it would be full of surprises.
I know you are the one that can bring out the best in him.
maybe, uh, I should start dressing the part.
he doesn't want you to be with your real family.
his fingerprints and yours are mirror copies of each other.
it's good to know the Luthor libido is still intact.
I've had people tracking you since you left the Kent farm.
but, uh, personally, I prefer the red of Kryptonite.
he heard you talking to Tess about hiding the truth from him.
there's a part of you that's Clark Kent.
imagine what a boy like Alexander could do
you, uh, may want to change yourself to impress Clark Kent,
we couldn't find a cure to stop the accelerated mitosis.
there are enough bone chips in those ashes for a DNA test.
I know how dangerous this is for Clark.
we can never let him know that half of him is Luthor.
but she must not be allowed to lead him to Clark Kent.
never let anyone stand in your way.
I think he just needs someone there for him, like family.
Lex Luthor created an empire.
it is time for my prodigal son to return.
when Lionel gave you up for adoption...
like things about his, um, genetic origin.
that's proof that the Lex you knew was a true Luthor.
you destroyed Lex with your secrets and lies.
thank god!
as the satellite info updates.
you have to get out of here.
Clark.
you kept it close
who?
but you were my hero...
just give me a minute.
this could take me a little.
you did.
how'd you know it was up there?
good luck...
you didn't have powers, ...thoughtful.
who told you that?
and I lost you.
you don't even know me.
now, don't tell me that you're actually wrestling
it's not me.
get up!
you.
hanging onto
is you.
what do you plan to do with him?
Bye.
this was grandpa's.
you leave that to me.
stuck in your life there.
your scar.
now, you live here with...
but you two need to hurry.
what else are you hiding, Tess?
lessons and guidance.
don't worry.
well, if you don't mind,
I'm not going back to lionel's world.
doesn't sound like much fun.
please.
thoughtful?
don't worry.
but...
Hey, put the gun down!
thank you.
you taught me so much.
without the attention,
bonus.
told you I was a psycho.
gold meteorite?
day of my life.
I'm not leaving you.
he's our father.
should die or not.
no.
Lionel's here.
what does it do to him?
Martha.
and me out patrolling...
if you don't believe me,
before those cops show up out here.
so instead of lemonade,
and dad
just have a look at the place.
redemption?
from what I'm seeing,
I will know where you are.
you can go to your world
him.
I know the view's not that nice,
Where's Clark Luthor? I need to find him.
he was right there, Lois, standing right there.
he is not gonna like the fact
what happened?
had quite the romantic dinner.
the gold stuff exists.
I'll head to watchtower next.
that's right.
so?
blur saves school kids
it's a suicide ride.
about?
No!
so why don't you come with me, to tear this place down.
you're no match for me.
well, that's so...
maybe you are.
pretty soon, we'll have all the time in the world.
is it drafty in here?
Lionel lied to you about him.
that's more valuable
that the ambulance chasers
where I didn't love you.
you're gonna have to ask Tess.
and I noticed you and Clark Luthor
and happy.
I was the one on the roof,
Yeah. It's from my mom.
with me.
Oh, just be careful of the last step.
just untie me.
and I was lucky because,
a turn-key, I hope.
so while I'm stranded here, he's...
no, let go of me! I'm gonna show you,
you were the man that I tried to live up to.
and we can go over there right now?
we may be small, but we sell big.
you can finally live the life
it's not here.
please still be here.
Clark Luthor -- he did this.
and you have a future in it.
it's not the place -- it's the people in it.
I have every confidence in your abilities.
is just fine for me.
Oliver Queen...
...Son.
and raze the place for me?
who are you?
in a few moments, we'll both be free.
okay, well, tell Conner I said hello,
meet me at 2318 Main,#207, Lois
change their minds.
let -- let go of me!
with the morality of whether or not the old bastard so...
I'll try to throw them off your trail.
good.
by Jonathan and Martha Kent.
aren't you gonna go?
have you been living here?
you brought me back.
set all of my fields on fire.
I'm not the lionel you knew.
I was inputting the surveillance data, and you didn't have a destiny to save the world, but I thought we could bring a little bit
you have to believe me.
Clark Kent, if I wasn't late,
which threat?
has memories attached to the place.
kind of, but everything around here
I just meant...
reroute
tearing this place down
okay.
you see, nobody has any idea if I let it all go.
and I'll try to come out and visit soon.
considering everything that's happened to you in this world...
they had floods.
you know that.
he's my father.
that's not the Tess I know.
Yeah.
I have a toothbrush to prove it.
it's me.
she's supposed to be your wife.
Soon-to-be. - Is he here?
that's why I found the rental pages.
Lois...
green rocks.
you really didn't have to.
you need to go -- now.
father?
Lionel Luthor.
and, you know, searching for Lionel alone
Yeah.
that the two nights that I was home,
you taught me the only person in control of your destiny...
now, look, this may be hard for you to understand,
thanks for coming.
it's the deed to the farm.
I got the feeling you might be mad.
that really shook you up.
well, the "For sale"-sign chasers
that explains why we didn't switch places.
don't kid yourself.
I see.
after I left three messages,
he goes around.
you don't need to be defined by your past.
anyway...
show up on your doorstep unannounced?
you son of a bitch!
Jor-El!
and once Lionel's out of the picture,
I couldn't keep up with the work.
and show people what you can give them
I couldn't keep up with the bills.
okay.
everyone knows who you are.
a fireplace -- how charming.
Smallville real estate
or did he elude us again?
admittedly, I'm no Martha Kent,
I can give you that.
and I'm the only one who knows
is it original to the house?
if you stop showing up for dinner,
I'm gonna need a bigger hint than that.
Clark thought he destroyed that months ago.
I mean, we can't get it to nail into place to save our lives
I'm sorry that you weren't found
how good of you to join us.
how was your day?
if we find a detail that he overlooked,
why would you ever believe in me?
being the world's greatest hero
you're all I'll ever need.
Oh, I should have known
Jor-El left us the wisdom of the universe
and someone wants to forget
you could conquer the universe.
ace of Clubs 8: 00, tonight, CL
you chose him over me, Tess.
not if you're talking about murder.
Oh, come on. It's not that bad. I still live at the farm.
the larger planet.
considering our undeniable chemistry,
I can get the deed to my farm back, that was really important to me.
it's all I've got.
I'm guessing it has to do with the fact
Lois, I have to call you back.
Kent Farm
there was a life here
so he can get his hands on these stupid little...
you know, Emil, it's been a really long day.
I guess without the darker side, something happened on the other side you and Tess snagged this from behind his back.
if I find Clark's darker side, I'll stall him,
and we gather here today
it can get broken.
you and Martha were married...
want to help me out here?
that we'd lose each other.
no, he had an emergency in...
that's why Ultraman killed Oliver.
did you find him...
Ouch.
I found a chunk of it once.
thanks for coming.
he took it right out from underneath us!
I can't live in a world where you don't love me.
that bad?
good morning.
something interesting?
what is it that you want?
I couldn't find Lionel...
what the hell do you know about Martha?
I'm not who you think I am.
everything I ever cared about.
well, the surprise at the end of the Kryptonite rainbow
he followed you, Clark, from his parallel world,
because I know you.
right.
I've been worried that
Oh, if you mean old as hell, yes,
you taught me how to be fair and honest.
then I would never find another one.
I know. I've seen it.
seems that makes this a one-way trip.
that the realtor you sent over to the house
okay.
and the other guys down at the feed shop.
you got to go. Goodbye.
you have feelings for Clark Kent.
uh, who, what, when, and why?
and they all know how to kill me.
you can choose a different future.
and, anyway, when I saw the realtor, somewhere safe.
is this time travel?
this place isn't your home -- Martha is.
and won't give me a chance to get it back.
our birth father is here.
Yeah, it's just a jacket.
every move you make.
to know that everyone who sees you wants you dead?
listen, Tess, I know better than anyone
mom.
it's my perfect size.
I called her. She didn't answer.
well, now that she's out of the way...
no -- yeah.
I would never let that happen.
he has a hold over us.
you get the finest microbrew in Kansas.
what does any of this mean without her?
maybe.
I understand what this is about.
you could save me some money.
it's a Kryptonian relic.
Lois, your heart is in journalism.
it's better to risk everything than hold onto nothing.
Oh, Manners. Marge Manners.
you get flustered around me, Tess.
the man of tomorrow -- Clark Luthor!
he's buying up every little bit of Smallville that he can
you see, with the reward money I get for you,
why the hell would I fight for somebody
with you at the Daily Planet most nights
mom, I really appreciate your gift.
I have to get back and stop him.
and certainly not as a woman.
as if memories could make up a lifetime.
you're kind of cute when you squirm.
I think I'm gonna like it here.
you're hooked on our Lionel cam, aren't you?
we could prove that he's a fake,
and his entire house of cards will come crashing down.
and you'd be in control.
not to move on.
and in that place, things are different!
the whole city?
I never had a permanent home growing up,
and if you need to move to metropolis
I knew a Luthor would die tonight.
because that was my mistake in the other world.
I figure you got about five minutes
sometimes Lionel's tracking system goes off-line
I was afraid that I'd lose myself
I don't want development proposals.
I haven't seen you since breakfast yesterday.
you have to get out of here.
I'll get the team right on it.
and Martha's still here. You still have a chance.
what about mom?
now, this fits you perfectly.
there's no take-backs when it comes to gold-k.
what fell out of that meteor shower but me
literally!
for when the coyotes came around the livestock.
and Clark's info from the alt-world was right.
just trust me.
and when you reprogrammed the tracker,
but there's still a chance of redemption for you.
and it has the soot buildup to prove it.
the only thing that matters in this world is you...
but I made my way just fine.
just let me show you one thing.
Yeah, but -- but, before you go,
I want an estimate on how much it will cost
Yes, you will.
and she's sending us an early wedding gift.
that's what you want.
a family.
well, drawing on the veritas journals,
Yeah, start our new married life there.
I've never seen you wear that before.
you looked tempted to me -- by him,
and when marge showed up today, I felt...
you know I didn't call that realtor.
with such a threat still out there.
you don't think I could have hidden that from you?
nothing.
you made yourself the most hated man in your world, and I remember living there with your folks,
answer your phone.
but I guess that's the price of having a heart
he was off cavorting around in Bangkok.
people know about the meteor rock where I'm from,
Clark, it seems like...
I would kick your bulletproof ass right now.
to cause you as much pain as you've caused me.
Lois, I've been trying to hold onto things
so, I pulled the geological surveys you gave me,
and I thought you understood that.
but here I can have a fresh start.
and you need someone to come in and save you.
so, do you want to have some fun, hmm,
I realized that I was about to lose something
you haven't been home five nights this week.
right here.
Oh, for our wedding.
it's lonely.
to start our new life together.
I mean, this thing smokes like the Dickens.
hanging onto my land, hanging onto my birthright.
I'll be back...
then you'll have a great story to tell Bill and Remy
if you're here to take out Lionel,
no.
that I told you I couldn't live in a world...
I'd be a little hurt if you didn't recognize me, sister.
you can't get 10 feet without it hitting you from every side.
the point is,
she's the reason you fought so hard for all of this.
let us take another look.
if you were meeting him here, you wouldn't be so nervous,
maybe she thinks we should sell it.
I'll call the realtor in the morning.
Really?
I'm sorry.
for different reasons, of course.
and now it's time to celebrate.
okay, look, I was mad that you made the decision
I can enjoy all the things that this world has to offer
I had one of these places in my world.
but mine is not facing the threat
Chloe's database, and my best calculations,
of course.
it looks like you gave up on yourself first.
we're just trying to get it juiced up again.
on the day of the meteor shower, Lionel Luthor didn't find me
anything else you want to tell me?
it could take away his powers... for good.
to sell without me, but it is your house, really.
I just have to check on something first.
of having my neck snapped in two.
of Smallville with us wherever we go.
you're the man who single-handedly destroyed
I'm guessing you stay awake at night,
this place grounds us.
still no sign of him. Have you two made any progress?
you have no idea what's gonna happen if they
who could have guessed that when a deed switches hands
it's like a parallel reality.
that used to protect me
so that leaves you.
coming.
but this isn't about us.
it depends. What day is it?
they are Luthor weeds, after all.
okay.
that's certainly not my preference.
who gave up on me the minute I needed her the most?
the whole world knows how to kill me there.
not a bad home to come back to.
Smallville is my home, Clark.
then Queen comes in and buys it all right out from under me
I'll see you later.
Clark...
Clark?
I'm not him. He sent me from my world.
uh, Ms. Mercer?
everyone in the city is carrying meteor rock with them.
I'd like to take a look at the rest of the house on my own.
you may have needed your hand held,
and I'm only asking for the same.
I guess I've
he took the mirror box with him, Lois.
Lois, put the rock away.
they're almost here.
to say goodbye to our husband and friend on this earth, that you're too afraid to even dream about...
then a studio apartment with rusty pipes
Oh, my god.
cause I feel a little cold -- clammy, really.
but if you want to get your hands on Lionel's GPS system,
she's taking bids at the mansion, or what's left of it.
please.
let me get this straight
come on, Tess. Damn it.
your dad's jacket
he got what he deserved! Rich brat!
angel or devil is in the eye of he who beholds it.
she says that Conner is doing great in Washington, D. C.
like they say, you can't go home again.
he who beholds it?
is just a little bit different than being Satan's child.
he s-stole all of our land!
something tells me that I can, I guess.
the most wanted man in the entire world
I can't bear it, but I do.
won't change the fact that you're a Luthor.
Jonathan?
why did you out yourself to me?
and if he's truly walking around on this earth...
home sweet home.
it's really hard to imagine a new life together is hogtied right here in my living room.
I guess...
I can't wait to see you in it.
you took that beating a little too easily.
the farm is the closest to a home that I've ever known.
the meteor shower wrecked my farm,
we're gonna get him back.
it hasn't been yours for years.
he told them that those rocks would protect them from you
well, I'm planning to see you for a few moments at the altar.
he doesn't appreciate you as a partner, Tess,
Nooooo!
I know.
dad?!
filled with -- with honest working men and honest working women.
your country crush
I look like somebody else, but I'm from a different place.
by his offer to make your father disappear for good.
it's not the place that makes the home.
how does it feel knowing that you're the most wanted man on earth,
that's right.
I don't know if I should be going for this promotion.
not this one -- this Smallville...
welcome home, my son.
the fields this morning -- big, something important.
you're offering me a life with you,
listen... You have to let me go.
in fact, I think they invented an apple-pie air freshener.
I wish that killing you with this rock could even begin
you've had a lot of second chances here, Tess,
you always said that you're nothing without her.
what it's like to walk around with a -- with a mark on you.
maybe you just don't believe it yet.
wouldn't want to miss how it all turns out.
this is nothing but a cold music box without the music.
he -- he ruined a perfectly good town
you...
the sirens -- someone could need you.
please, Lois, you have to believe me.
but something was holding you back.
and in some twisted, messed-up way,
I would find enough that I could finally buy my farm back.
talk about nature versus nurture.
we have all the time in the world.
even though I thought you were a total dork at the time.
I'm just an...obsessed man, hanging onto a place if we didn't have this place to come home to...
you have some nerve showing up here after you put him in that grave.
that's because I know everything about you, Tess.
I'm afraid I won't be the one that can help you.
and Lionel's not there anymore.
you've been out here, alone,
first, we need to get rid of this stargazer's junk.
and no one knows what a monster he is more than me.
what -- have you been watching a little too much BBC lately?
I'm assuming you destroyed yours?
you said -- you said that we could have a life together.
you picture the day when you defeat him.
not entirely,
it's done.
Mr. Kent, I know you're here! I saw you walk in!
I could never trust you. It's too late.
she's the one with all her claws in daddy dearest.
you did, and you raised me as your son.
what are you doing here? Where's Clark?
the day you got here was the worst...
but I am looking forward to discovering the differences.
I don't know what your definition of romance is,
and I thought, maybe if I kept digging,
my team's doing some exploratory work to gauge the structure,
but now I'm thinking maybe I already have something
and dear old dad.
the weeds will grow up and take the place over.
it's what I want... with you.
funny. I don't feel out of control.
because that's who the world needs you to be,
I'm not sure what to say.
Oh, I think I've got a pretty good idea of who you are.
you're my ticket out of this.
it did shine a light on a few things we've been avoiding.
this farm, my parents.
that's because you have a habit of lying to yourself.
I'm not the Tess you knew in your world.
I was just trying to find my way back home.
Yeah, um, she must want us to...
maybe I'm not the person you think I am.
gold.
that'll never happen. That's why we're together.
if you want to sell the farm, we'll make a new start.
but you could have killed Tess in an instant,
I've known we should be moving to Metropolis for a while now.
but if I don't help you, you'll kill me?
afraid that if we lost that, if I lost that home,
they lived here, but this was never a home.
follow the GPS. It will lead you right to him.
scared of nightmares -- of being abandoned.
Yeah, well, maybe he'll feel different when it saves his life.
you're putting a lot of trust in me
I assume our damsel in distress is...
she said I totally freaked out, didn't she?
Oh, Clark Kent -- frisky. I like it.
as I recall, talking was never your strong suit.
maybe that was just an excuse for me not to...
and to offer our continued support to Mrs. Queen.
Oh, just as quaint on the inside!
and I can finally start living my life again.
or, with all the commuting to Metropolis and Bangkok...
Hey, I recognize him.
who's that gonna be?
you're gonna wave,
a bug?
No!
I-- no.
that's my cue.
negative, sir.
drop it.
the fact that you're here
what's going on?
football?
you ready over there?
sorry.
me.
what do you say?
it's dangerous.
but if people find out
the billboard.
so you've said.
either one's fine.
Hey.
not exactly.
awesome.
what is this?
excuse me, Mr. Kord.
but...
speak a little softer,
but, sir...
it could be dangerous.
who are you?
I can do it.
like it was a parasite.
I knew it.
through the exit door?
excuse me.
to debut his dashing smile
okay!
so do ratings.
that's impending fame.
Really?
Clark.
never mind.
okay.
so, Mr. Kord, does this mean
see, right through here,
me!
it doesn't matter.
you owned it today.
but what, smallville?
I mean, it always does.
I can't -- I can't
than I am comfortable with.
just like they did before.
security!
they want to look up in the sky.
no, I'm not.
it doesn't matter.
brilliant save, sir.
as in...
this wasn't supposed to happen.
destroy.
you're that kid.
so they can look up...
how'd you get through security?
while the real heroes
that's why I founded Kord Industries.
but he's no blur.
we need to make sure slope your shoulders a little bit,
almost.
to the blur.
but he doesn't stop the accident.
me?
or not.
and crime scene in the city?
hiding his insecurities,
I'm happy to help you
a very dangerous one,
get over it.
to smile for the camera, Clark.
and maybe my mom.
booster.
Hey, hey, watch it!
I can do it.
now!
thank you, Mr. Mayor.
I am Booster Gold,
I didn't send these.
he just sweeps in at the last second.
I mean, can you smell it?
hello.
what?
where does she want to meet?
say hello, Skeets.
Yeah, I can read.
he isn't hiding anything.
may the best reporter win.
when you still have work to do here?
I can do that for you.
I borrowed the ring.
Clark...
he's allergic to them, remember?
until someone gets hurt.
targeting.
no, don't.
is teaching me mild-mannered 101.
Yeah. It's a start.
of what happened to Kord's scarab.
what? What is it, Cark?
doesn't have anything to hide.
silence.
here, Jaime.
trust me.
you all right?
is a wise decision, sir?
Clark's nice and all,
I know how busy you must be, Mr. Kord, and find this missing tech.
you stole that ring!
who are you?
look, we need to get together,
and that's supposed to help?
I'm trying to help.
are you sure you've never seen him before?
no comment.
okay.
say "cheese," junior.
of the 25th century, all right?
just a few desks over.
you're an XL, right?
have you or a loved one ever felt like
you may be going upstairs,
he's on every single station.
the blur.
listen, kid.
you'll be able to remove it from him?
you know what? I'm gonna need a sound check.
press? Listen, I already told them
he can replace you.
what is it?
to lead up the lost and found yourself.
just but don't put yourself on a pedestal just yet.
I saw him first.
I had something in mind.
did you know in the last 24 hours
what are you gonna do?!
it bonded with one of Kord's scientists
booster.
find your missing trinket, Mr. Kord.
that poor kid down there
super.
you just don't get it, do you, gorgeous?
Thanks.
what?
Yeah.
so did he.
not yet.
if you came all the way from Chicago
control this thing.
but their research and development means you've already changed history,
he makes the save, and he gets the photo-op.
I saw the sign.
blurring their way in and out
it's all right.
so either the blur starts wearing a mask or...
and we need to find Kord's missing weapon.
kid...
and that's you.
booster Gold!
ladies...
is Booster Gold.
or are going to do,
okay, so drama sells.
Kord hired Booster to bring it back
they said that desk could be yours.
I'm not all right at all.
you can't stand the fact
we need to talk.
Skeets...
these need to stay on.
but... - Sorry, blondie.
of course it was, Skeets.
so great.
Yes, you can! Fight it!
that's it.
be yourself.
we're gonna help each other, gorgeous,
how could you miss that?
and I doubt that Skeets has any record
or gold.
I'm so sorry.
greatest hero on earth.
they're ready for you, sir.
Lois, what are you doing?
are you sure trying to usurp and lift a freight train with one finger.
no. Lois...
I sit next to someone who told me
touch?
I'm only giving statements, no interviews.
I mean, if there was ever a time for the blur
just kidding. I'm the star of the show.
if not for rent.
and I made all the same mistakes.
okay, not to ask the obvious, up into the stratosphere.
apparently not.
stop! Stop! Stop!
in exchange for the key to the city.
and what you're going to be.
Thanks, Dora.
and I always know
I knew you wouldn't have the cajones
and what is that, Lois?
...Great.
somewhat inaccurate.
Kord Industries.
Booster!
cat Grant of the Daily Planet.
I came here to make a fresh start,
I'm not interested in you, goldilocks,
okay.
uh, "cheese"?
time travel's nothing to play around with.
what's the catch?
Yeah, but before that handsome hero face
I'd say you were jealous of this guy.
thank you.
Yes! They put them up already.
you know I can't do that yet.
I know you and the mayor
besides...
after you, you know, stop blurring
booster Gold!
well...
her interview made you-know-who
you need to handle it with caution.
I've had worse.
as one of the nation's leading industrialists,
okay, look, it's eat or be eaten.
speak of the showboat.
but you can't just sweep in and take my story.
Lois...
and it's enough to convince the powers-that-be
Garrett killed three people,
what's with the box? Moving on?
booster Gold didn't come here for no reason.
exactly what to do at exactly the right time,
okay?
after all that's happened, which means this thing must be really important
you wanted me to believe in heroes, Lois
...Exactly like that.
well, I'm sure we can work out
so does Booster Gold.
who said we were looking for a weapon?
all right, everybody, back to work.
Yeah, but that's
and history says whoever gets the key
pleasure to meet you, Mr. Kent.
it isn't yours just yet.
nice glasses.
how could they ever understand
you may have a line of people waiting for your autograph,
don't!
what could be wrong with that?
I'll be signing autographs.
you didn't want anything to do with him before I did.
they're gonna lose faith in the heroes major.
and start standing in the spotlight.
but I haven't seen him.
that he's doing this for personal fame,
I'm not a front-page reporter, though.
he took the brunt of my ego, Clark.
all right.
Yeah.
well, I think I finally might.
is it?
you want a fan base bigger than the blur?
you know, Clark, if I didn't know better,
that'll never happen.
you can be a hero.
and what's it say this time?
me...
when my football career ended.
but first...
...Historical data droid.
but, l-listen, you can be.
you can help me! You're a hero!
the guy's name was Dan Garrett.
Yeah. And it's perfect.
Clark Kent does. I know.
what's your name again?
was gonna blow up in my face sooner or later.
I came here to tell you to hit the skies.
no one's at risk. All right?
and this jacket -- it's not helping.
tell them you're mad as hell
but the damage is done now.
ping me.
but it's an important one.
this incident is already drawing more attention
reveal yourself to the world.
and when they brought this scarab in for study, duty calls.
and neither is the Daily Planet.
what can I do for you?
I can handle whatever comes around the corner, Clark.
till now!
booster is the least of our problem.
no.
I can't do anything!
I also heard what she said.
affirmative, sir.
question is, why?
that you'd be interested in this?
the thought of going back to that, I...
I'm about to get the key to the city.
he's been here like a day.
I'm worshipped by billions.
I'm sorry!
see you later, Clark Kent!
I'm counting on it.
so you -- you fight it!
and stop being so... so...
and thanks to my reporting on the VRA, that I nearly lost my head.
these glasses are driving me crazy.
I'm more at home in the lab...
is there a restroom I could use here?
booster Gold Fan Club
I should have come back here a long time ago.
Clark, I am not gonna let the blur be forgotten
I mean, Clark.
do it your way.
you can see his face. His name
no.
now that Steve Lombard went to the Daily Star.
booster Gold?
I work for the Daily Planet.
fine.
my own sister
the hero of Metropolis.
Booster!
but I don't know what to do!
Yeah.
who?
your words, not mine.
and then you would say...
for that heroic rescue.
it's not gonna happen.
and I'll back mine.
I know you're competitive, Lois,
Yes!
just work on it.
help." By making me stumble into Ron Troupe?
you choose.
booster Gold has made it to every major accident
she said the exact same thing to me
I didn't come here to endorse you, superstar.
this boy is absolutely unique.
people are gonna stop trusting me again.
look, after all the hero hating of the VRA,
stop on by.
will you be thanking anyone, sir?
I know.
the Blackwater of the midwest.
Yeah.
so send out the entire field team.
you save people for profit, for fame,
if the blur doesn't show his face soon...
so, just -- I don't know
you were right. I stole the ring.
Skeets, that's a pretty good job description.
I mean, it has everything...
heroism is not for sale.
it's a Booster Gold guarantee.
are you sick of all those masked men
sorry.
you're not gonna be needing them anymore.
well, thanks for being my number-one fan.
thanks for being my number-one fan.
we're not leaving Metropolis until we find it.
real heroes don't have anything to hide.
Clark Kent's destiny for your own
so can you swing it or not?
just excuse him.
I need to figure out who he is and why he's here.
thankfully, I didn't.
Mr. Gold?
with the gold guardian of Metropolis,
I don't really have a bad side, guys.
Kent, Cla-- Cl-Clark Kent. I'm sorry.
Romeo will take the hint soon enough and lose interest.
who wants to be the star of the show?
the powerful, the intelligent, the...
the real you can burn holes through buildings with a look
this new Clark Kent.
you know, the last thing you should be worried about some kind of a reward, Mr. Gold.
it's really true what they say about Metropolis.
some kind of high-tech device went missing who started betting on his own games.
I-I-I need your help. Something happened to me.
Yeah.
you keep backing your horse, Lois,
thank you all for this opportunity
because one exclusive in-depth interview
later today, at the Ace of Clubs, "You're gonna be safe.
listen, you're talking to the single greatest hero
figuratively and literally.
I thought if I did everything you did,
I had a milkshake on the way in, and I...
when did you forget how to walk, Kent?
you sure will.
that you used to work for the government.
and then he died when they tried to take it off.
I'm kind of a big deal.
the suit doesn't make the hero.
I-I'm...
Why?
sir? - My agent.
without so much as a hello or goodbye?
your key to the city.
but what?
maybe he just liked your glasses.
Booster's more real than the blur.
excuse me, folks, but...
well, don't settle for anything less than the Gold standard, especially to anyone who finds it.
you're up for my promotion?
that's funny. That's not what these people are saying.
I don't.
take a shot in the dark.
I was a sports star...
you're putting me and my friends at risk.
I can -- I can do this.
Oh, boy, can we.
thanks for being my number-one fan.
life lesson to remember, kid
no, not until we've reverse-"Pygmalion
I was using your words.
I mean, I always knew all of this
I will zap you to honeybee heaven.
they need to look up in the sky.
you should be focused on that promotion that opened up
he managed to shut down the scarab.
but still, I screwed up
Yeah.
no. No.
hang up the glasses and the red and blue suit.
you're gonna smile,
which, by the way, isn't exactly gonna be a fitting name
I know what this is really about.
this is about you.
I-I tried. They said you were here.
I mean, in the future, I got caught.
no catch. You deserved it.
go ahead!
we can make this work.
our presence here has made my historical data and he actually thinks
you're from the future? You're a Legionnaire?
and this thing is somewhere in Metropolis. - Yeah.
now, like -- like, punish them with it, you know?
that's sort of the point here, Clark. Try and keep up.
so you get over there and enjoy your meal, right?
because some bright and shiny object flies up into the sky.
now let's focus on what's really important here.
I find it so refreshing that at least one hero out there
I'm a reporter this serious stud into a blunder of beige.
you're like peanut butter and jelly.
well, the spotlight's kind of crowded with Booster Gold.
let's take this interview outside.
I'm mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take it anymore.
and...
now me and my city would like to thank you,
I've gathered myself a small but vocal fan base.
you want to know how to be a great reporter?
well, I had a run-in with our gloating guardian, ends up on jumbotron screens in all your red-and-blue glory,
you surprised me.
but I'll be keeping cozy right down here.
how dangerous is it?
you see, I can fly under the radar.
you're going to be late for the signing.
and the reasons that he makes them.
Danger"! It's my middle name.
Yes, but
it is not a trinket. It is a weapon
did she get the flowers?
so why don't you see if you can fit that big old head of yours
one move, bug...
excuse me. I'm sorry.
but you're obviously not.
it's gonna be me. Yeah.
Hey! Blur boy.
booster, wait!
Lois.
sir, you have a message from Miss Lane.
I have a following of my own, you know.
okay, let's rehearse this one more time.
humble
like what?
thanks for being my number-one fan.
did you have something for me to sign?
you want the glory, don't you?
but I do need somebody to hand me the key to the city.
how did you know I was up for a...
thanks to the assistance of my when one of his trucks crashed into Booster Gold.
what an ass.
it's your choice, kid.
you went from sleek to geek in under 24 hours.
I surprised myself.
mm, there you are -- the hero maker.
you mean "asset.
something that actually starts with that "S" you wear.
who else? Booster Gold.
Oh, everything's for sale...
miss Lane.
not interested. It's got to be Lois Lane or nobody.
look, if you need anything, call the hotline, all right?
no!!
you're sitting at my desk.
what do you say we give Miss Lane here
the all-new, all-different Clark would not be sending me roses.
if you need a hero...
the blur." No. No, no, no.
to put my hat in the ring for the desk upstairs.
okay.
the strong and...
something...
okay, you were the one who chose to take his hero game public,
I'm sure you're all wondering who I am.
but what's wrong with having another hero in town?
I-I can't...
don't slouch, talk with confidence,
I want to make sure they can hear my acceptance speech.
you got to brand it, baby. You know?
metropolis is the blur's jurisdiction.
congratulations on the promotion, Lois.
I came here to replace him.
they're out there earning back the people's trust.
and you're gonna lock up that promotion that you're up for.
all you got to do is show me up.
Ted Kord agreed to remove the scarab.
I understand. I get it.
and my answer to that promotion.
I forgot I dropped it.
well...we -- we already went over that.
and that's why you'll never be anything like the blur.
whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop right there.
all right.
well, how about the 411?
Ah, they're more like acquaintances, actually.
kick me." A classic.
if you want to invest in a fixer-upper,
not if I get there first this time around.
maybe he'll grow out of it.
that's what Ted Kord is looking for.
always keep yourself open to the cameras.
people love that sentimental stuff.
but you are making way more out of this than you need to.
Oh, just try it with me.
guys! Wait -- me
it's okay to get mad.
I was calling Lois to thank her for the photo-op.
okay.
except somebody to look up to.
let's just say it's the last thing on my to-do list.
Oh, and, Clark...
and then I started throwing them.
how many times have we seen the blur's face?
sir, how important is this weapon?
we can't replace what's been lost, Sonia.
Oh, Clark.
I ca-- I can do this! I can -- I can do it!
an exclusive on the real hero of the day?
I'm mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take it anymore.
uh, I-I know you're hoping to be interviewed by Lois Lane, - Destroy. - Don't!
look, I've never been comfortable in a suit and tie.
I checked the file. It's some sort of extraterrestrial technology.
she's not as bad as he is.
you still feel that way now?
sir, um, excuse me.
No!
the blur has reasons for every single thing he does.
the truth is...
see, perception is reality, Miss Lane.
he seems to know when and where these things are gonna happen.
now, you go back over there, and tell them
the greatest hero you've never heard of...
Clark Kent, Daily... Daily Planet.
what are people gonna think about you?
I appreciate the thought, but you have to stop it.
or you.
look at the reality that I've created.
well, you know what? I got some advice for you, too.
I can live down expectations of Clark Kent
I want to learn how to use them.
you can assure me you'll be discreet?
I have Booster Gold on the line, sir.
it... It attacked me.
after seeing all the trouble that Booster went through,
put that suit on display and...steal my thunder.
jealous? Me?
the world has me now.
Lois, I need to clean up Booster's mess
the fact is, in the moment, you believed them.
a hero brings out the best in people.
I don't want to have anything to do with him...
Lois, it doesn't matter what people say about me.
that people are choosing me over you, right?
what's that?
I don't know, kid. You know...
Oh, what's happening to me?
S-someone once told me that the suit doesn't make the hero,
I could take your spot in history.
I'll help you find whatever you need me to find.
inventing and testing new technology... - It's Ted Kord. Kord Industries.
so is "Fame, fortune, and front page," Clark.
it sounds like a roller coaster or something.
all right? You look all right to me.
is that the last of it, Lois?
Clark, you want people to look down on Clark Kent
I'm pure gold, ladies and gentlemen.
listen, kid, I'm sorry I blew you off earlier.
but me -- I am delivering the goods, baby.
looking people in the eye and letting them know,
Lois Lane. Booster Gold.
still, I'd love to see you boost our golden boy
now, Kord claims that his company is all about technology,
I can't control this suit. Please, help me!
it scores pretty big with the ladies, too.
legion ring.
along with my dignity and my reputation and...
not as long as I keep flying in
I appreciate the support, but this is not a competition.
but Jaime will need someone to watch over him.
you should read their tweets. They love me.
it appears Clark Kent may be correct.
includes many things that are not listed on their annual stock report.
you pull some strings, get me the key to the city,
all right, all right. I like it, I like it.
I'm guessing not everyone has what it takes to do that.
I'm gonna give you your chance to claim it.
it was easier to lose than try to win.
Lois, I was like that, in Smallville.
I so badly wanted to be the voice of a hero, too, this is my last chance to be somebody again...
you should stand up for yourself.
I guess I went a little too far trying to compete.
that there is nothing handsome or heroic about Clark Kent.
Lois, we're going against traffic.
he said "nice glasses," like he knew who I really was.
you needed help from someone who really cares?
go big or go home.
but they're really good friends of mine.
I stole the suit, even skeets.
Oh. Moving in.
Hey, a fan!
I-I guess so.
sorry. Here. Listen, I'll make sure they pencil you in.
you just have to have faith in what you are...
my fame, my fortune went right down the toilet,
I have no record of this or our apparent attacker, sir.
we should do lunch... soon.
I mean, who would want to hide that face?
you need something strong. You need something simple.
you want the key to the city.
I forget, you've never felt it.
it's not the front-page victory you were looking for,
the blur is just not giving it to them.
it's not perfect.
how many times has the blur told us why he's protecting us?
it's not for a paycheck, Cat.
I trust you'll go out the same way you came in.
a hero's made in the moment by the choices that he makes
your endorsement is gonna take me right to the top.
Skeets, what other choice do I have?
that didn't stop the mayor from offering the blur the key to the city.
cat Grant -- like nails on a chalkboard.
I didn't come here to be like the blur.
as long as the blur's out there saving people, but...
and you're not gonna take it anymore.
and real heroes don't stop to strike a pose.
I am here, but...I'm kind of busy.
disarming recovered superweapons.
no. No, he's not.
Yeah.
they were signed for, sir. And apparently they worked.
I'll do it.
not like you think I am, kid.
but, like the Legion, yes, I'm from the future, Cark.
unmaking Clark Kent so that we can get the blur out there.
he and the scarab merged as one.
I will, as soon as we make a deal.
she said, "The suit doesn't make the hero.
and stop being so... so shy.
okay, not that my curiosity isn't in overdrive about booster boy, to protect and serve this great city of Metropolis.
booster is not the bright and shiny object we need to be worried about.
the rush of being out there
I think I can make the glasses work.
I want to be a hero like Booster Gold.
and being that miracle that people are hoping for,
look, I, uh... I better get heading back.
booster Gold's star will burn out faster than you can say "up, up, and away.
I saw the way Cat looked at me.
I'll start brainstorming.
whatever it takes to get the scarab back.
actually, she's closing in on you now.
I am from the future, but I'm no hero.
I don't doubt that behind that star, there is a hero...
people are excited about a hero that they can actually see.
you never want to let that feeling end.
I mean, aside from his ridiculous personality.
I mean, will that take away the power it gives me?
honey, you need to be invisible and forgettable and...
becomes this city's man of steel.
you helped Jaime break free of that scarab.
Clark, meet your new desk buddy.
may I offer a piece of advice from your former career, sir?
Oh, trust me, smallville.
booster Gold could be the city's answer to inspiration...
...By grabbing Clark Kent's place in history.
we didn't find him. He found us.
I could have swore I hit you.
so, what are you, man or superman?
I haven't figured it out yet.
you are the last son of Krypton.
what are you trying to tell me, dad?
that I'm from another planet?
I just don't know how I'm supposed to be the man he wanted me to be without him here.
who are you? - Lois Lane.
I've seen the way you two look at each other.
Lois and Clark would be great together.
you're looking at the newest recruit to The Daily Planet.
to me, you're more than just a hero. You're a superhero.
I am the villain of this story.
Lionel's here. - I'm not the Lionel you knew.
Lex is dead. - That is a lie.
you're all engineered from Lex's DNA.
when I sent the Kandorians away,
I opened a door for something else to come to Earth.
it preys upon the dark side that we already have.
our unholy trinity is complete, preparing the way for Lord Darkseid.
you won't remember any of this.
I think the Omega is a sign of corruption
a mark that the darkness has fully taken over someone.
what if one of us were to get infected?
if we can't stop it, the darkness will infect every person on this planet.
gold meteorite? - It could take away his powers.
you could be the greatest hero the world has ever known.
not according to Jor-El.
well, then, do what you do best -- prove him wrong.
you may not see me as a hero, but the rest of the world does!
and I decide my fate! - Your journey is far from over.
goodbye, Jor-El.
and now the series finale of "Smallville."
this is the story of an amazing boy who grew up in the fields of Kansas...
in a little town called Smallville.
when he became a man, he believed the only way to seize his destiny
was to turn his back on both his parents and refuse to see the darkness descending on Earth.
but all that was about to change.
he was about to face his greatest challenge.
some people take time off when it's their wedding day.
there is no wedding.
don't pretend you didn't hear what I said last night.
and you're one to talk.
that blue underoo sticking out of your collar means you're on the job, too.
just keeping busy. I didn't want to crowd you.
you know, you haven't called in eight hours.
usually you figure things out when I give you some space.
or you can just keep avoiding me.
I'm not avoiding you, I have work to do.
president just arrived in town for a fundraiser, plus a huge stack of police reports just came in.
and I have to call all the guests and let them know that the big day has been canceled.
nice try, speedy, but you can't make 411 disappear.
your Copperfield act is impressive, but it won't change my mind.
go out there and save the day, wherever it needs saving.
Lois, there's a whole team of heroes out there protecting the world...
so we can get married.
you really don't see it, do you?
you're a hero, and that's how it should be.
it's just that you've gotten so used to the fact that you know you're gonna be able to fix everything and make everything right that you cut out any possibility that there are some things that you just...
you can't fix.
we don't need fixing.
we don't.
but we are in an impossible situation, one that you can't superspeed or superhear or superleap your way out of.
Clark, every minutes that you spend with me
having dinner, arguing about paint colors, arguing about whether or not to get married
you could be out there saving someone.
Lois, this is my future, and I want you to be a part of it.
Yeah, well, maybe we don't get what we want.
Clark, I'm just in your way.
you're not in my way, Lois.
you're by my side.
and if you really want to go through with canceling the wedding, you're gonna have to leave me standing at the altar.
who knew tying the knot was so much work?
you got to remind me to thank Zatanna for making our nuptials so hassle-free.
I don't know. I would have liked to have remembered some of the details of our wedding.
well, considering the other details of that night, all I really need is a marriage license.
you know, I was wondering if you were - I was gonna ask you
sorry. You can go ahead. - You should go first.
go ahead.
if Zatanna hadn't put you under that spell, would you still have, um...
gone through with it?
Yeah. It's the best decision I don't remember making.
what about you? - Ditto.
so, what are we supposed to do now, anyway?
buy a condo and a cuisinart?
supposed to do" has never been a part of our unique relationship.
we've always made up our own way of doing things.
Yeah.
including making our big day the quietest non-event of all time.
you know, we may be trumped in the non-event category by Lois and Clark.
she still hasn't called back.
I phoned, texted, and e-mailed her, but it's all quiet on the wedding front.
well, you know, it is the matron of honor's duty to get the bride to the altar on time, so you may want to reel her in.
my best-man duties are all taken care of. I, uh...
picked these up this morning. - So considerable.
simple and classic. - Yeah.
all you have to do is get the mice and the pumpkin over to Cinderella's and get her to the church on time.
I see you're living up to your Luthor name, last heir to the dark dynasty.
I'm rebuilding this mansion to make it a symbol for something good - - to change the way that people see us and the Luthor legacy.
why are you here?
I shouldn't be here, but I couldn't help myself.
look at you...
all grown up.
I always wanted to be there for you, a loving mother.
you were never my mother.
you were special.
every soul on earth charts its own destiny, each decision tipping it toward the light or toward the darkness.
I could always tell which side of the balance my girls would fall to.
but you were different.
you were born to darkness, yet you yearned for the light.
being a Luthor doesn't determine my fate.
then you must listen to me. I can't bear to see you suffer.
I want to give your soul eternal life!
please, Lutessa, let me save you!
from what?
Darkseid's apokolips is threating you.
evil in its purest form -- the heart of human nature, obscured over time as something to be cast away rather than embraced.
hades, Kali -- even the word "Lucifer" is an old Latin phrase meaning "morning star, " "bringer of light."
I'm afraid the centuries and translations have twisted Darkseid's true gifts.
but...
before the end of days, his rapture will be the only salvation.
I will never join you.
farewell, my child.
bless your soul.
wait.
when?
what do you mean? When?
when is this hell coming?
it's not coming, Lutessa.
it's upon us.
mom? I thought you were staying at the bed and breakfast.
and I thought I was coming back to a home that you and Lois were building together.
we are, in Metropolis.
I hope. I sent you a message.
we close escrow in a few days.
Clark, I think you misunderstood when I sent you the deed.
this is our home.
we've already accepted the offer.
you're -- you're right in the middle of a re-election campaign.
just because I'm moving ahead with my life doesn't mean
I'm letting go of everything that came before.
that was a hard lesson to learn.
is this about dad?
look, I know it's been tough since he died, - being the one left behind - that's just it.
I was never left behind.
no matter where I am or who I'm choosing to bring into my life, your father is always with me.
and he's with you, if you just allow yourself to see him by heart.
I did.
last year.
I thought I was talking to him.
but then I realized it was just an excuse for me not to face my future -- just like I was waiting for Jor-El to show me the way.
I had to move on.
I'm so proud of the man you've become.
but why bring up dad today of all days?
because this is a day to celebrate the next step in the journey you're on and everyone who's been a part of it.
and you don't think I'm doing that?
Clark, you're so focused on what's ahead that you're starting to cut out the parts of your past that made you who you are.
I...
I can't begin to imagine the pain you see every day when you're out there.
I know you have to put blinders on to cope with your responsibilities, but if you turn your back on all the experiences that made you strong and compassionate because they hurt...
I'm afraid that, one day, everything you learned in Smallville will have been for nothing.
I'm never gonna let that happen.
you already are, and you don't see it.
sweetheart...
all I'm saying is...
you don't have to let go of the past to move on.
Yes, you do, mom. I'm sorry.
I love you, but you have to find a way to put all of this behind you , just like I did.
it's the only way to move on.
all right, come on, people.
air Force One landed an hour ago, and they still haven't left the hangar.
this news hound smells a story.
give me something I can sink my teeth into.
no, no, and no.
look, I know you have a laundry list of reasons not to get married tumbling around in your head, but you're never gonna see the big picture if you get stuck in spin cycle.
there is no Chloe quip that's gonna make me change my mind.
Clark can hear the world's cries for help, and he's duty-bound to answer the call.
I am not gonna stand in his way.
he can't listen all the time, Lois. He's not God.
he can't be aware of every bird or blade of grass, okay?
he's a man.
and sometimes he needs to not listen.
he needs to rest, to love, to laugh.
and when he finally does decide to take to the skies, he's gonna need you to ground him.
that's what I'm afraid of.
I'm grounding him, keeping him from soaring to new heights.
Oh, Lois...
that is so not what he thinks.
but since you're not gonna meet him at the altar...
you should hear that in his own words.
I, Clark Kent, take you, Lois Lane, "to be my companion...
forever.
with you by my side, i will never be alone.
though the world sees a strong and independent woman, I've never known someone with such gentle grace and more pure of heart.
when I've been lost, you've always been there to bring me back.
so, on this day, at this moment, I pledge the rest of my life to you.
you've always believed in me, and I believe in you.
and when you believe in someone, it's not for a minute or just for now.
it's forever.
I'm such an idiot.
watchtower, access satellite Chloe Two.
satellite Chloe Two access unavailable.
not online.
what the hell is going on?
satellite was programmed to disconnect.
then we don't have our eye in the sky. Who gave that command?
I'm sorry,You do not have the proper security clearance, Miss Mercer.
link me to Queen Industry satellite Hotel-Alpha-4-2.
offline
all Queen Industry satellites are offline and inaccessible.
how is that possible?
program command to disconnect came from Watchtower base at 1242 hours.
bring up Watchtower security footage from that time.
accessing.
what did you do?
can you access Watchtower's orbiter's video feed?
manhunter has put the new space station online, per your request.
thank God for our favorite martian.
watchtower, show me what's out there.
video feed on main monitor.
I've done what you asked.
they won't know apokolips is coming.
our dark lord will be pleased.
now he asks one final mission of you
to protect the souls we have saved.
this will disarm the bringer of light, the one who threatens to vanquish the darkness.
I never wanted to say goodbye.
then don't.
I thought I had it all figured out
how to move on...
how to bury my guilt, my insecurities, my questions, but...
I'm so close to success.
I know who I'll become. I've seen it.
Lois thinks I should let her go.
mom says I should hold on to you.
you don't need to hold on to somebody, Clark, if they're already in your heart.
I just can't keep leaning on you...
on Jor-El. I need to stand alone, you know?
it's better that way.
you mean it's easier that way.
just I've missed you so much.
then let me be there for you, Clark.
and don't push your mother away.
we're part of you.
it's like I'm on a cliff, standing on the edge, and where I'm looking is beyond where you've ever been before.
it's beyond where Jor-El has ever been before.
and as much as I value everything you've given me...
I need to go beyond where either of you can guide me anymore, to be the hero that the world needs me to be.
why is it that the biggest events are always the most painful?
you know, Clark, when I graduated from Excelsior.
it was one of the most important days of my life, but...
but I don't remember any of the speeches that were given.
I don't remember getting my diploma.
I just, uh...
I remember my parents not being there.
I know what you're trying to say, Oliver, but I'm not here to mourn my father's death.
I already did that.
I've put it behind me.
okay, well, if by "putting it behind you,
you mean saying sayonara to your ice dad, selling the farm, and hanging out in a cemetery instead of being at church wearing an uncomfortably starched suit...
what if Lois was right? What if this is all wrong?
my training, Smallville, the farm, my memories - - what if it was all just a crutch?
Clark, I don't think taking a scalpel to your past is gonna turn you into the caped Skywalker of your future.
I thought Lois was my future.
I thought she was my new life and my destiny, but what if she's part of the memories I need to leave behind?
what if heroes aren't destined to love?
I've been down this road before. I've gone through this.
you know where it landed me?
I Burning a perfectly good leather hoodie.
when I was on the edge, it took a really good friend to remind me who I was, to push me toward who I could become.
but that's the thing, Oliver.
no one can push me or lead me anywhere.
my whole life, I've been trying to fit in in two different worlds, and the truth is,
I don't belong to either one of them.
I need to make my own path.
maybe that means letting go of...
both worlds.
maybe it means letting go of Lois.
careful, there, Prince Charming.
it's bad luck to sneak a peek at the bride before you get to the altar.
I know that technically you saw me this morning, but the rules only apply when the wedding is officially on.
on?
Lois, I thought you called off the wedding.
don't have a cow, farm boy...
but I read your vows, and I know that that is against the rules, but a little birdie bridesmaid gave it to me, and...
they were beautiful. And I realized that I was a fool because I was -- what we have is a gift, and I was trying to return it.
and we're a perfect fit.
so here's my vows. Now we're even.
Lois, sometimes you can see things that I can't.
and you walked away, I thought, because you couldn't bring yourself to be the one to stand in the way of my destiny.
well, here's the thing about that.
I can be loud.
and, at times, I'm a little bossy.
so someone might wonder why a person of your godlike caliber would be with a woman who is so imperfect.
well, don't take this the wrong way, but you come with some baggage of your own.
and it's made me a better person, just like being with me will make you a greater man...
and a super hero. I hope.
what if you were right, you know?
with your family not being here and the doubts that you had yesterday...
maybe the stars aren't aligned.
well, believe me, it's a buzz kill that the Chief of Staff whisked daddy away into some hush meeting, but...
I'm a big girl.
I can walk myself down the aisle.
as my mom always said, the ones you love are always with you.
and right now, my dad would be telling me that I should have laid out all my clothes the night before so that I wouldn't be whirling around like a dervish.
and mom -- she's reminding me that I need to breathe and take in every moment so that...
I can remember them forever.
what would your dad say, Clark?
I'm not sure he would say anything, Lois.
that's kind of the way it was with my dad.
I always knew exactly what he was thinking.
Clark, what did you mean...
about the stars not aligning?
I wanted these vows to be perfect, "but perfection's a hard thing to get your hands on.
but life is meant to be a little messy.
and when it comes to love, "I think it's like my dad always said about the army - "you only sign up if it's the only thing "you could ever imagine doing.
and, Clark, I cannot imagine "spending a moment of my life without you.
so I promise that I will always have your back, as you will always have mine.
you're my best friend, you're my home, and you're my true love.
and I am yours and will be forever.
I'm here.
I'll see you at the chapel.
Yeah.
see you there.
I hope one of you gets this.
because of the interference in the atmosphere, I don't know if my calls are going through, but
what the hell?
God!
everything okay, Smallville? - Perfect.
it's perfect.
I wanted these vows to be perfect,
but perfection's a hard thing to get your hands on.
but life is meant to be a little messy.
and when it comes to love,"I think it's like my dad always said about the army
you only sign up if it's the only thing you could ever imagine doing.
I, Clark Kent, take you, Lois Lane ,to be my companion, forever.
and with you by my side, I will never be alone.
you're my best friend, you're my home, and you're my true love.
and I am yours and will be forever.
on this day, at this moment, I pledge the rest of my life to you.
you've always believed in me, and I believe in you.
and when you believe in someone, it's not for a minute or just for now. It's forever.
No!
Oliver, what are you do-- Chloe.
get everybody out of here!
okay, everybody let's go. -- Go！
surrender to the darkness. - Never.
Clark! - Lois, no!
Oliver! This isn't you.
don't let it take you over.
Oliver? Listen to me.
you need to fight it. - You're too late.
there's no saving you.
that's not true.
you haven't always made the right choices, and you once gave up on yourself and those around you.
I'm not giving up on you, Oliver.
you have a good heart. Let it guide you.
you and I -- we have to save the world together.
I need you to be a hero.
I know you'll make the right choice.
you know Gold Kryptonite will take my powers away forever.
I believe in you.
everything's okay now.
no, it's not.
looks like the world's gonna need its heroes sooner than we thought.
to witness these strange atmospheric changes. There seems to be an eclipse...
I guess the cellphone reception was starting to go down while Tess was leaving you this message.
can you play that again?
I was trying to warn you. Watchtower's been compromised.
the prophets are at the center of this.
according to the journals, the apocalypse is an actual planet. It's coming.
the eclipse -- Darkseid's behind it.
that must have been why he tried to get Oliver to put that ring on me.
he knows I would have tried to stop him.
we need to find Tess. It sounds like she may know a way to defeat the darkness.
thank you, General.
the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Defense Department aren't saying anything until the President makes a statement.
if the Pentagon's not stepping up, I'll call in every available agent.
something tells me we'll need them all.
no offense, but I think we're gonna need a bigger team, and if Watchtower's down, I got to go to Star City to access my database.
then I'm going with you. - No, I got this.
your talents are better used here with Clark. We got to figure out what happened with Watchtower.
see you in the funny pages.
Hey.
I'd feel better if you let me be your chauffeur.
no.
you need to do what you do best -- be a hero.
you too, Sullivan.
dad.
I knew you'd see me again...
when you were ready.
I made a mistake, dad.
I thought I had to leave you behind.
but it's you and mom and everyone that I care about that makes this world worth saving.
but you're worried you're gonna fail this time.
I know you're scared, son.
I faced Darkseid before.
he knows my weakness,He almost defeated me.
I need your help.
but, son, he never saw the man who's standing before me now.
Clark Kent, as much as your mother and I tried to protect you from your origins, tried to prepare you to face any challenge...
I'm sorry, son, but our guidance just isn't enough anymore.
you're gonna have to let Jor-El guide you from here on out.
I can't, dad.
I turned my back on him, like I did you.
he's your father. He'll understand.
don't doubt yourself, Clark.
this has been coming for a long time.
before you arrived...
we wanted a child so badly.
the day you found us in that field, you were the miracle we prayed for.
now the world needs that same miracle.
son... It's time.
thank you.
it's good to have you back.
I should have guessed it would be you.
no, no. No, no, no. Don't beat yourself up, Tess.
I've been watching you very closely.
I must admit... I underestimated you.
it's a little late?
it's not really time for a father-daughter chat.
there's literally a planet hurtling toward earth.
do I catch the tiniest hint of a doubt?
are you worried that your savior in red might not prevail?
he needs me. - Wrong.
he needs no one.
I've seen what he's capable of.
it's ironic... I'm the only one who seems to believe in him, isn't it?
don't question where my allegiance lies.
it's time you embrace your lineage, Tess
it' time to become the Luthor you were destined to be.
why did you bring me here?- My son, Lex -- your brother, a genius
carried on with the family business.
as you know, Lex cloned himself.
there were many clones.
none of them were perfect, but some of the pieces were.
no. - Yes.
Lex took the best pieces and grafted them into a masterwork.
I don't believe you. - Of course you don't.
Lex is a visionary. You're not.
where is he, then? - He'll reveal himself when he's ready.
it's not possible.
there is one thing Lex wasn't able to duplicate successfully.
Lex is missing a heart.
and who better to save him than the sister who loves him?
Luthors are survivors.
you are one of us, my dear.
it's all right.
when the day is done, I will see the Luthor name resurrected...
more powerful than ever.
according to the journals, the apocalypse is an actual planet. It's coming.
what the hell? my God!
No! No!
No! No!
you must see that you're the cause of your own undoing.
he's your brother, Don't you know?
I thought Conner's heart would have been a more poetic choice.
you've hidden him so cleverly, there's no alternative.
Lex is worth killing your own daughter?
Lex is worth everything to me.
finally...
you will serve an important purpose in my life.
looks like my purpose in your life has changed.
you refused me once, but this may be the moment when you'll reconsider my offer.
I never intended to live forever.
there's only one life I care about.
let my son live.
in exchange for your soul.
Lois? - All satellite and Internet connections went down 15 minutes ago.
have you found Tess? - Only her abandoned car.
she was on her way to Smallville to warn us.
I think with that planet hurtling toward Earth, everyone got the warning.
you think those three prophets, or whatever you call them, took Tess?
we're about to find out. She left her cellphone underneath the car seat with a video message for one of us to find.
one of us with X-ray vision, maybe.
my fellow Americans, the White House scientific advisers have ensured me that the eclipse you are all undoubtedly seeing is caused by a meteor...
we know that the prophets use people's darkness to mark them with an Omega.
what we don't know is why.
and Tess quoted one of the prophecies as saying that the markings weren't just spiritual.
there's some sort of anti-life dark force that could bring about the apocalypse.
you mean like bringing a giant planet crashing into ours?
exactly like that
maybe the marking has some sort of unexplainable gravitational pull.
too bad anti-life equations aren't covered in physics 101.
I need to figure out a way to lift the darkness and break whatever's binding these people to that planet.
today definitely tops Chloe's wall of weird.
exactly how many people are marked?
more than you want to know.
Clark, you inspired the darkness out of Oliver.
I can't do that for everyone on the planet, Lois. If Tess knows how to stop this, I need to find her.
she got a shot of her car's parking camera and the license plate of whoever took her.
our internal database shows it's registered to...
a company called Preclox? - Yeah.
it was founded only six weeks ago.
according to their bank records, they have limitless funds for genetic research.
I only know of one mega-mogul who's obsessed with genetic engineering.
Lionel Luthor. - Who knows that he's being tracked by Tess Mercer.
Yeah, but the GPS went down with the satellites.
it should tell us where he was 15 minutes ago.
Lois, that's the Luthor mansion. - But that place burned to the ground.
maybe what Lionel's after is underground.
the Luthor mansion was built on a labyrinth of corridors underneath it.
Lois, no matter what happens...
Clark, a person that I greatly admire once told me that when you believe in someone, it's not for a few minutes or sometimes or just for now. It's forever.
now go save the world.
I'll be fine.
I call on each and every one of you to stand strong in the moments to come that our military has a precision plan to take care of the meteor fragments.
we will take swift action in securing the world's safety.
a General doesn't miss his daughter's wedding unless he's been called to duty. Oh, my God.
excuse me.
Janet, you're covering the President's visit, right?
I need you to get a message to him for me.
look, I grew up in the military. That speech has buzz words
precision plan," "swift action. " They're gonna nuke that thing.
only that thing isn't the little meteor that'll break apart like they think it is.
it's a planet, and it won't even make a dent.
but the radioactive fallout of this missile it'll kill millions.
take it to The Inquisitor.
I've got a plane to catch with the President.
okay, well, then you tell him that he can't press the proverbial button.
why not? - Because The Blur will save us before it ever comes to that.
the Blur? Oh, my God, Lois.
if you think the President, his military advisers, or anyone is ever gonna take you seriously
I'm sorry. I wouldn't have had to do that if the world wasn't in jeopardy...
and you weren't such a bitch.
Hello, Clark.
can't say I love what you've done with the place.
you still say it the same way
astonishment mixed with a hint of dread, yet...
with a hopeful finish.
you're alive.
it seems my father had a change of heart.
and I got a second chance at life.
Where's Tess?
what have you done with her?!
she's fine.
I wouldn't worry so much about my dear little sister.
you know, I used to think it was our families that made us who we are.
then I hoped it was our friends.
but if you look at history, the great men and women of the world have always been defined...
by their enemies.
you have a second chance. You can change all that.
but that's the thing about memories
you can't forget them.
like how you were always that one step ahead of me, Clark.
no matter how meticulously I prepared, no matter how strategic I was...
if only I'd known I never stood a chance.
it wasn't a competition. - Of course it wasn't.
you were born to be the chosen one.
you're simply better than us.
and that always killed you.
no.
no, what killed me is that you didn't even want it.
you fought it. You hid from it!
I would have taken it and relished it, embraced it.
my destiny wasn't yours to take!
I get that now...
which is why I finally embraced my own.
you and I...
we will both be great men.
because of each other, we have a destiny together, Clark...
only on different sides.
I'll always be there to stop you.
always.
Oh, I'm counting on it.
our story hasn't been written yet, Kal-El.
and every villain is only as great as his hero.
but, you see, that all relies on you saving us from the coming apocalypse.
you know about Darkseid?
you really think I just read the Cliffsnotes of the Veritas journals?
they foretold of a chosen savior
the light that will inspire this world out of darkness.
you are the light power, Clark.
only you hold the power within you.
I'm not so sure that Clark Kent can save the entire world on his own.
he can't.
but we both know who can.
I'm sorry I couldn't save you, Lex.
activate computer monitors.
monitors on.
systems online.
the day of judgment is upon us.
we've saved the willing souls from the coming apocalypse to serve the dark lord.
our work is done.
you can say that again.
your mark has been lifted.
that's impossible.
I got this friend -- cool leather jacket, blurs faster than a speeding bullet.
he's pretty good at impossible.
you were so close to experiencing the rapture, known only to those who will be serving our lord for eternity while all the others perish.
do you really think you possess the power to vanquish our lord from the souls of those he saved?
no. But I got friends in high places.
you're not authorized to go in there.
I must have forgotten my hall pass.
I was just going to the bathroom.
it's that way. - Okay.
they said that they would brief us in 2 minutes.
it's now been 15, and I really need...
do you see that giant molten orb out there?
now, whatever story they told you, it's crashing into the planet.
you can see it with your own eyes.
hey ! stop!
I just need a few minutes of your time.
I'm sorry, sir. - No! Wait!
I have information that you need to know.
I don't know how you got on this plane, young lady, but you're stepping so far out of your position.
all that matters is the truth, and you don't have it.
please, Mr. Secretary.
I have proof that the meteor that you're about to nuke into oblivion is much larger than you realize, with a density that will result in you spewing nuclear fallout over half the hemisphere that could take out millions of people.
but you already know that, don't you?
my God. You all realize that you're gonna be taking out 1/3 of the Earth's population, and you're not even gonna warn them?
we can't spread panic.
it will only aggravate an already impossible situation.
and what about your families?
and the President?
where are we gonna... - To a secure bunker.
the casualties are nothing compared to losing the entire planet.
we don't have a choice.
now, if you'll excuse us
no, wait. You do have a choice
heroes, one in particular who will stop this before you unleash your nukes.
now, I know that some deeply disturbed brass may have rounded them up and tried to dirty their names, but the people had their day.
and they gave our heroes a chance to prove themselves.
you owe the people of this country a chance to see that their faith was worth something.
the world is in crisis!
this is not a time for your little hero crusade, miss
I'm Lane. This is exactly the time for my hero.
he will be here. He will save us. I promise.
now, I know that you all want to see your families again.
you just need to give our heroes a chance.
your heroes have five minutes.
the lost son of Jor-El.
my father sent me here to protect this planet.
and I will fight you till my last breath.
there must be a part of you that's disgusted by how easily your people fell to me.
they may not be perfect, but I believe even in the darkest soul, there's always hope.
people want to believe in something greater, and it may be easier to hate...
but it's stronger to love.
is it?
eons have passed since I came face-to-face with a force that could possibly tip the balance to the light.
you are the light!
you cast out the darkness from Oliver Queen,
you will surrender to me.
you will lose your soul.
I will annihilate you!
Clark, you're gonna have to let Jor-El guide you from here on out.
you've always had the power within you, my son.
these were my trials.
your final trial is upon you, my son.
you are ready.
seize your Destiny.
something told me that I'd find you here.
I combed the lab, and I saw what happened.
long time, sis.
did you always know?
why do you think I recruited you, treated you as my own flesh and blood?
you used me. - Semantics.
I'd say dear old dad did most of the abusing.
wouldn't you?
I guess the bullet in his chest answers that question, huh?
he wanted nothing more than to have you back again.
and what did you want, Tess?
something I'll never have. - Clark?
redemption.
I love you, sis.
you know I'm actually saving you.
from what? - From turning into me.
it's too late.
Clark already did that.
it's the neurotoxin that you started at Summerholt.
it penetrates... - dermal tissue.
paralyzing all cognitive recognition.
how long? - 30 seconds.
what will I remember?
nothing.
the world before this moment won't exist to you.
your journey has come to an end, Kal-El.
I shouldn't have tried to push away my Kryptonian side.
my strength is accepting it
accepting you.
you honor me.
a father's pride cannot be measured in words, but know that I am proud of you, son.
you have no idea how long I've waited to hear you say that.
we have been down a long road together, Kal-El, one paved with difficult trials.
those trials are behind you now.
any father can only hope that he is one day humbled by the feats of his son.
but it is your soul, Kal-El, of which I am most proud.
you -- and you alone -- possess the courage, the determination, and the compassion that will be required of you to lift the darkness from the Earth.
I ask you to remember one thing.
your abilities may be of my blood, but it is your time in Smallville, with Jonathan and Martha Kent and all the people there, that made you a hero, Kal-El.
always hold on to Smallville.

the Man of Steel deserves better than a circus incident and a fender bender.

Yes, Miss Lane. - Okay.

I'm sorry. Excuse me.
pardon me.
Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Lane.
let me just, uh... It's just I was, uh...

Yes, Miss Lane. - That's so hot.
but listen, this is serious. Do you have them?

Yes.
are you ready?
I've been ready for seven years.

GentIemen...
...I give you...
...the future!
my name is Brian MacGreggor.
I live in Portersburgh, Scotland. Have my whole life.
I'm captain of the Portersburgh Portsmen club football squad.
in the past four years, we've won only two games.
the last win was three years ago.
but it wasn't always like that.
this is Alex Foote.
he's the best football player Portersburgh ever produced.
maybe the best in the United Kingdom.
he was also my best friend.
after that goal, Alex signed with a London club for big bucks.
it wasn't a harmonious split.
and Alex and I's friendship ended on a very sour note.
it was quite a shock, to say the least.
kind of like being struck by lightning.
which, by the way, I was.
now, that was a real shock. No pun intended.
they say lightning never strikes in the same place twice.
but I'm not so sure that I believe it.
you see, this is the story of the second time......I was struck by lightning.
and I don't mean the kind from the sky.
it was a different kind of shock altogether.
but believe me, it delivered a charge so powerful...
... that it altered my life forever.
come on, Angus. Pass the baII.
over here. I'm open.
give me a shot.
kick it!
go on! That's right. Get the baII.
this pIace stinks. -Zach.

don't taIk about my mother Iike you knew her, okay?
you didn't.
let's go.
ScotIand. -Come on.
there's Brian. -So, Brian...
...I was thinking that, you know, maybe if you wanted me to

I'm sorry to bother you, Mr...

we're Iooking for a Brian MacGreggor.
Mr. Knox, is he here?
I'm afraid you just missed him. He had a footbaII game.
on a workday?
used to be that every day was a great day to watch the Portsmen pIay.
untiI their current Iosing streak. -How Iong a Iosing streak?
fifty-nine matches.
they suck.
Yeah, pretty much.
I'd be happy to make sure he gets the message.
thank you, but I think this is something...
...Mr. MacGreggor needs to hear in person.
let's...
let's get this over with.
Hey, come on!
come on!

Mr. MacGreggor.
Zach's mom has recentIy passed.
she was unwed and she didn't have any Iiving heirs to take care of her son.
so she had a strong desire in her wiII...
...for him to be with his bioIogicaI father.
sorry, I don't see how any of this has got to do with me.
do you remember a woman by the name of Mary Ann ConnoIIy?
Yeah, of course I do.
Hey, wait a minute, I've not seen her for 13 years.
Yeah. Zach...
...he's 12 and a haIf.
wait a minute. Who toId you this?
did he teII you? Did the boy teII you this?
no, she did.
hey there, buddy.
you wanna pIay?
okay.

you're pretty smart. But can you count?
what's two pIus one?
you wanna pIay some more?
cooI.
it's my dying wish to make amends and unite you two.
pIease honor my request.
my boy is aII aIone in the worId.
he needs you.
bIoody incredibIe, mate. Make him do it again.
make him do it again.
pIease. -Sure, why didn't you say so?
where is he going?
I guess he wants to pIay.
this is gonna take a Iot of time.
perfect scenario? Of course it's not a perfect scenario!
I mean, Iook at me! I'm not a father!
but I thought she said-- -No, I don't mean that!
I'm just not-- Not what I meant.
weII, what did you mean, then? -What I mean is that...
this is a very big responsibiIity for a guy Iike me.
big responsibiIity or not, he's stiII your son, isn't he, Iaddie?
weII, aye, but
did you see that?
Mr. MacGreggor.
focus, Mr. Mac-- I don't see this as a Iaughing matter.
way to go! -Yeah!
did you get that? Did you get that?
good boy. Yeah.
what a dump.
aII right, weII, you know, it's not Buckingham PaIace.
but I've got a spare room in the back.
and I thought I couId turn it into a IittIe bedroom for you.
Oh, right.
it's a cIoset.
Yeah, weII, what I' II do is cIean out aII that sh-- Stuff.
and I'II put a bed in there.
and untiI I do, you can have my room.
and I' II sIeep on the couch.
come on, boy.
maybe this wasn't such a good idea after aII.
no one's expecting miracIes overnight, Mr. MacGreggor.
Hey, I'm...
so how's it work? I mean, is that it?
no. I wouId stay on for a few weeks to observe...
...and determine if the boy's best interests Iie here or eIsewhere.
you said he had nowhere eIse to go. -There's not.
if it's concIuded that I can't find a home for him here with you...
...the boy wiII be brought back to the U. S. and pIaced into foster care.
what's he think about aII this?
aII right, weII, I suppose that answers that question.
Zach, what's he doing on my bed?
I thought you said it was my bed now.
Yeah. Right. It's just
he might not have had his shots yet.
we don't know that he hasn't. -Yeah, but
I know that you don't want me to be here.
I don't want to be here either. -That's not what I meant.
look, I don't know what I'm supposed to do here.
this isn't the sort of thing that comes with a manuaI.
do you know what I mean?
save me the euphemism, okay?
you don't expect me to caII you " Dad, " do you?
no.
no, you can caII me Brian.
okay, weII, I've had a reaIIy Iong day, okay?
and I'm kind of tired.
can I get you anything?
how wouId you Iike a nice hot gIass of miIk?
my mommy used to bring me miIk when I was
good night. -AII right.
just you and me, boy.
Oh, Mary Ann.
I hope you know what you're doing.
it was a fitting end to a riveting football season...
... when the London Bangers defeated the Fleet Street Barbers 3 to 1...
... in an unprecedented fourth consecutive cup.
but the celebrations came to a crashing halt Tuesday evening...
... when Alex Foote, team captain and fan favorite...
... found himself stranded in the penalty box of corporate and ethical scandal.
in an early morning raid on STX Industries...
...makers of Alex Foote-endorsed Foote Cologne for Men...
... investigators discovered the cosmetics conglomerate's labs...
...housed hundreds of animals being used in grisly...
...and sometimes fatal testing experiments.
when Mr. Foote was asked if he was aware of these horrendous practices...
... this is what he said.
if it takes a couple of dogs to smell that good, who cares?
well, Mr. Foote has put it squarely in his mouth.
this is Roy Richardson for Cheerio London.
paparazzi haven't had this much fun...
...since the prime minister woke up naked in the monkey house at London Zoo.
and that's just here in London.
what's the big deaI? Who's gonna miss a few mangy mutts anyway?
the big deaI, AIex...
...is that your popuIarity poIIs are down by 63 percent.
the networks are taIking boycott.
your sponsors are threatening to puII their funding...
...if we don't do something about this soon.
you're the spin-doctor, Cora.
start spinning.
weII...
...Whatever we do, it'II have to be handIed just right.
now Iet me think.
there's got to be something we can use to turn this train wreck around.
in other news, The Portersburgh Portsmen got a brand new fan today.
and if you ask me, they ought to let the little guy join the team.
heaven knows it couldn't hurt. -Of course.
aII right, where is he?
you heard me, where is he?
Where's who? -Who?
him, who do you think?
Zach's taking him for a waIk.
Zach? Who's Zach?
he's Brian's son, aIthough I'd never see the resembIance.
Brian has a son? WeII, I never-- WeII, congratuIation.
your son?!
it's a Iong story. Remember Mary Ann ConnoIIy?
Brian, that dog is a star.
not some chiId's pIaything.
do you have any idea what that dog means to Portersburgh?
listen to me carefuIIy and cIoseIy.
AIex Foote is coming home to Portersburgh.
you what? -I said AIex Foote
we heard what you said. But for the Iove of grace, why?
weII, to pIay footbaII, of course.
but the season's finished!
it won't be exactIy an officiaI match.
more a charity event for P-A-W-S.
paws? -Portersburgh AnimaI WeIfare Society.
Portersburgh doesn't have an animaI weIfare society.
we do now.
now, no offense, right, Mr. Mayor.
but I think in the history of dumb ideas...
...this one of yours takes the pie.
I wouId have thought that you, of aII peopIe...
...wouId find this a worthwhiIe cause.
being as you are, as I understand it...
...a new father and aII.
I' II put it to the team, aII right?
no. No, no, Brian!
I won't pIay with a dog and that's finaI.
it's just one game. -One game!
one game you can be assured WaIIace won't be pIaying in.
it is for a good cause, though, isn't it?
what's the cause again?
Portersburgh Society for AnimaIs on WeIfare.
I thought it was the WeIfare Society for Portersburgh AnimaIs?
you mean to teII me these animaIs are on the doIe?
nobody said nothing to me about free money.
where do we sign up? -Can you stop taIking about money?
nobody is on the doIe.
it's about heIping the IittIe animaIs of Portersburgh.
so, WiIIie, you in or not?
weII...
...I suppose animaIs are peopIe too.
so I'm in.
but onIy if we' re pIaying to win!
excuse me, Braveheart.
but I was under the impression that you conceded defeat...
...the moment this team went canine.
you sorry excuse for a Scotsman!
in what's come to be known as last week's " Stinky Foote Scandal " ...
... the team captain of the London Bangers...
...has managed to bounce into favorate with the public by denouncing the unethical treatment of animals far and wide.
Alex Foote denounces the unethical treatment of animals far and wide.
and to prove this denouncement...
...Alex is heading back home to Portersburgh, Scotland...
... where he and the rest of the Bangers will kick off...
... the Portersburgh Animal Welfare Society's fundraising charity event...
this is one row you won't want to miss.
and I'll be there, Roy Richardson, with Cheerio London.
don't worry, boy. I' II get it for you.
aII right, the three of you.
that's it. You're doing my head in.
I cannot take it anymore.
come on, that's enough practice for today. Outside.
so, what's his name, anyway?
he does have a name, doesn't he?
of course he has a name.
that's it. -What's it?
that's a stupid name.
but I guess if the shoe fits, right, Yank?
it's not a stupid name. -I wasn't taIking to you, marbIe-mouth.
look, I don't know if insuIting peopIe is your idea of fun...
...but it's not mine.
so why don't you just Ieave us aIone. -Think fast, Yank!
beIieve this is yours.
I beIieve you've been hoIding out on us.
what do you say we take this to the fieId? See who's better.
what do you say we don't?
you're a coward, Yank.
I'm not afraid of anything.
then prove it.
fine.
noon, tomorrow. Don't be Iate.
by the way...
...think fast!
Oh, shoot.
whiIe you were at work today...
...your first day of being a father, I might add...
...you had absoIuteIy no idea what Zach was doing or where he was.
