beattie led for several laps before he was overhauled by Itoh.
beattie notes that courtine's work suggests that all three components of the rehab strategy-the drugs, the electrical stimulation, and the robot-assisted physical therapy-seem to be necessary to maximize recovery.
beattie turns to literature over and over, doling out writing advice, making proclamations about how fiction functions, using it as the key to unlock real people.
beattie, who teaches at the university of virginia, is one of the most acclaimed short story writers of her generation (she's a baby boomer).
Beatty exploits these contradictions to show that literature is morbid and dangerously complex, and that it deserves incineration.
Beatty's no fool, I'm telling you.
Beatweek writes that people expect zuck to be awkward, especially after jesse eisenberg's portrayal of him as a robotic misanthrope in "the social network." So this presentation, despite all the real-time, online mockery, may have actually helped his reputation.
beaty is the smile on the earth's face, open to all, and needs but the eyes to see, the mood to understand.
