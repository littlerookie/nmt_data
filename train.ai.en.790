Hey, can you back up?
it's pretty hard to focus when you're breathing down my neck.
not bad.
uh, thanks. Thank you.
Justin, can you come by and see me tomorrow during office hours?
uh, yeah. Everything... All right?
just want to discuss a few things.
Yeah, yeah, I'll be there. - Great.
this is about last week's quiz.
damn it. I thought I nailed it.
we studied that for, like, six straight hours.
God, why does he want to talk to me?
I told him I wanted to switch lab partners.
what? - Sorry, nothing personal.
but I just need someone who's 100% committed. - Wait a second. You told Madsen I wasn't committed?
you show up late. - Yeah, and you freaked out when you saw a cadaver.
I didn't go running to Madsen. - That was once, this is a pattern.
you know what? Screw you.
back up, Carter.
here we go.
P. b. mini marshmallows, oven-fried chicken, - mac and cheese and pudding.
God, how do I get your diet? - Mm.
Oh, sorry. That was insensitive.
it's okay. I'm...
I-I guess mom is trying to spark my appetite by bringing out all my old childhood favorites.
but... Oh, no way.
I'm not hungry.
I don't care. You are going to eat.
all right, I'll eat... Yeah?
if you tell me more about Mr. Frenchy.
it's a deal.
you never made it to that winery you were looking for, did you? - Not that week, no.
week?
Mm-hmm. It was amazing.
Oh.
stop blocking your face.
you're making me self-conscious.
your face, it is powerful and soft...
like you.
what do you know about me, except for my inability to read a map?
your expressions... it tells me many things.
for example... Your brow, your jaw...
Sarah, you're a woman who's in control.
you like control.
your eyes and your smile...
they say something different.
you want to be wild, give in to your impulses.
did they teach you that at art school?
no.
it's something I simply see.
what else do you simply see?
that you're slow to trust.
maybe a little.
but you want to let go.
hello.
hello.
should I come back?
Yeah, yeah. - No, no. - No, no, no.
uh, you'll stay, I'll go. - No, no, no.
we'll, uh, continue this tomorrow. - Oh, tomorrow?
Mm-hmm. Keep her hydrated, will you? - Yeah, yeah. Thanks.
no problem. I'll call you tomorrow.
when I'm better, we're going to France.
wherever you want.
how's Evan? - Oh, his... his cold's getting better.
the doctor says he's almost well enough to be around you.
Oh, good, good. Cause I really miss him.
he sent a very nice note.
so how was it?
uh, it wasn't, uh...
it wasn't as scary as I thought it would be.
and I... I'm definitely nauseated, though.
Oh.
here.
Mm.
what's that?
acupressure.
if I put pressure right on your palm, it reduces nausea.
how come I never knew about this skill before?
cause I just looked it up online.
I'm just... happy to be able to do something to help.
are you gonna make me ask about the press conference?
it went fine. - Fine?
Yeah. - That's it?
but you... but you always tell me everything, right down to the distracting sheen on the loafers - of Ted from the "times." - Usually, my wife isn't just finishing - her first round of chemo. - What were the numbers? I bet you're down with women.
what... what are they?
we took a hit. - Oh.
but I'm not worried. - You always worry. That's why you win.
all right, well, this time, I'm gonna win - and I'm not gonna worry. How's that sound? - Like a lie.
come here.
just leave...
california out there.
in here, it's just you and me.
Hey.
Hey. How are you?
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh, what?
you're folding socks.
you only fold socks when you're upset.
well, we don't have a wedding venue and my mother and I fought today.
Oh, well, that sucks.
Yeah. How was your day?
remember that oncology internship I applied for? - Oh, no. You didn't get it?
Oh, that's up in the air, but check this out.
so Carter decides to tell professor Madsen - that he wants a new lab partner. - What?
Yeah. He says I can't handle the workload that I already got.
Doogie thinks you can't hack it? What a tool.
all right, so what's going on with the venue things?
Ugh. I mean, I had no idea that wedding stuff is so cookie cutter. It's just not us.
all right. So what would make it personal?
Rebecca, I'm sure when you were a little girl,
you know, you had plans about your wedding.
Kitty and Sarah used to play bride all the time.
so did Kevin.
well, I didn't.
I mean... I... I mean, it's not like I had some wedding album of my mother's to look through, you know?
I... I think you have a defective bride.
Rebecca, I don't have a defective bride... at all.
well, I don't know. I don't know.
I... I think maybe you should plan the wedding. Yeah.
well, unless you want chill dogs and chicken wings - at a dodger game, that's probably a bad idea. - Oh.
how's Kitty?
she's asleep.
great.
God, she's tough.
according to Sarah, they had fun today.
good. I'm glad Sarah's back.
Kitty needs you guys.
how are you holding up?
good.
so I assume you don't want an update on the polls, - which are still down. - Correct assumption.
uh, well, let's see, in other important state matters...
Oh, yeah, Madera County would like your support in their campaign to change the state bird.
how about the ostrich? They're so cute.
you know, they do that whole head-burying-in-the-sand thing.
I'm not burying my head in the sand. - Yes, you are. Come on, Robert.
you march into that office and act like you're working.
we all know what's going on... - What do you want from me?
you do realize, Kitty will not let you quit this campaign? - I haven't quit.
no, you've stopped running, because you know if you do nothing, your whole campaign will fall apart on its own,
and you can tell Kitty you tried your best.
reality is, you're sabotaging your chances, and you know it. - Kevin, stay out of it.
Hey, how are you feeling?
Oh, I feel like I want to vomit, and the deep breaths are not cutting it, so please, - you need to tell me the end. - It was a vacation romance.
and... like vacations...
it ended. - Oh, I know.
but just tell me... tell me how.
are you there?
Yeah.
uh, you know...
he... he wasn't who I thought he was.
the last day I was there, I went for a walk.
Sarah... who was that?
I must explain. - Don't bother.
I'm so sorry.
you wonder why I don't trust.
no, no, no. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
no, no, wait a... wait a second. I know this.
you go back to your car, and it doesn't start. - What?
Uh-huh, and then you go back to the farmhouse
with the both of them.
it's the movie. - What movie?
Oh, come on, Sarah. This whole time, you've been telling me the plot of that French movie that mom used to love when we were kids.
okay, you're right. You busted me. I'm sorry.
you mad at me?
no, I'm not mad. I'm...
you took my mind off of everything.
I'm... I'm just very sad that you didn't get to have a love affair with a hunky frenchman.
yeah... me, too.
Hey, where'd you go?
I thought you were next to me the whole time?
Oh. You're not Robert.
he's at the drug store filling a prescription.
but I can sit with you if you want.
that's why I'm here. - Mm.
are you allowed to have that?
Mm-hmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mm, that blog was right.
chemo definitely makes the beer taste better.
could I? - Get your own. I have cancer.
Wow.
Mmm. So, um...
Robert's been getting really beat up for not suspending his campaign, right?
he told you?
Nope. He didn't have to.
Oh.
how bad is it? - You know what? I wouldn't say that bad.
well, that's because he won't let you.
but what's the plan? What's the counter strategy?
Oh, great. You don't have one.
you know what?
I'm kinda caught here between a rock and his wife, - So can we just... - Oh, you know what? Come on, Kevin.
he's not doing anything.
Oh. It's... it's like the rope-a-dope with no plan of coming off the ropes - and actually throwing any punches. - All right. So what are we gonna do?
let him suspend... a clean, dignified break.
why let him limp through a campaign - he doesn't even want to be a part? - Mnh-mnh.
all he wants is to be here with you. - Well, too bad. He can't.
why not? You know, you keep asking us to keep on living normally. Well, you know what?
people put things on hold when people are sick. - No, no, no, we're not gonna put anything on hold...
Yes, they do. Take care of your wife. That's acting normally! - Because if he quits, and I don't survive this, then what?
don't... please do not go there, okay? - Well, I have to go there, Kevin. I don't have a choice.
now you are either in denial of who Robert is or you're in denial of how things may turn out for me, okay?
if he quits, and I die, then what?
and we're not gonna let that happen.
and you are gonna help me, Kevin, - Because Robert needs this, especially if... - Please, one condition.
what? - No more "if-thing." you're getting better.
that's that. - Okay, fine. I'm getting better.
so how do we help him?
I think I have an idea.
look, sir, I... I know that going for an internship right now may not be the best idea, but...
has someone in your family been diagnosed with cancer?
Yeah. Um... my sister Kitty.
it's lymphoma, stage III.
how did... How did you know that... - Because I've seen this before...
a... a sudden academic fire, newfound interest in oncology.
I'm sorry. - I... you know, I... I... that's...
I'm... I just want to help somehow.
and there's nothing wrong with that, and many of the greatest advances in medicine, in every branch of science, has been made by people who have very personal motives.
then... then why is going for an internship a bad idea? - Justin, because there is a right way and a wrong way to go about things.
taking on so much in your first year, and then, god forbid, you fail?
how does that help anybody?
Yeah, you're... you're right. I... I... I get it.
and now...
about Carter.
Carter, yeah. He, uh, he wants a new lab partner.
well, he is brilliant. - So he tells me.
but he is so afraid of failure. He can't think straight. - Me too.
but you have more practical life experience than any student I've had in years.
and he's had less life than anyone I've ever met.
so what, you... you want me to get him laid or...
no, Mr. Walker.
I want you to teach him by example how to get along with people in the real world.
Yeah, I... yeah, I c... I can do that.
good.
and look, someday you may become an extraordinary oncologist, able to help people like your sister.
but every journey starts with the first step.
and in this case, the first step is the hand.
start with the hand.
Mm-hmm.
Hey.
Hey.
I left my cell phone in the car.
I'm surprised that you wanted to meet me here.
no, I... I asked you because I wanted your opinion.
Yeah.
but, uh, I also really need to apologize. I'm... I'm sorry.
I... I was frustrated, and I took it out on you,
and I shouldn't have.
I promise I won't be all bridezilla - for the rest of the wedding planning. - You weren't that bad.
and I'm sure it was really annoying me picking up the phone all the time.
no, no. Is everything okay? - Yeah. Everything is great now.
I got enough juice that we can start production - on our new blend. - That's great.
it's great.
but today is about you and your wedding.
so what do you think about this place?
Ugh! Mom.
hmm.
is it me, or do all of these places suck? - No, you're right.
none of these places have been right for you and Justin.
so let's just take a step back, all right? - Mm-hmm.
okay, so now when you think about your wedding, what do you picture?
I don't have a picture.
I mean, where was I when all of these little girls were staging fake weddings in their bedrooms?
outside in the backyard splashing in the mud and begging me to let you stay out - for "five more minutes, please, mommy." - I remember.
you would stay out as long as I would let you.
you and that stuffed dolphin that I got you at sea world, running through the ferns.
Awoka-Woka. - Awoka-what?
Awoka-Woka. That's it. - What?
mom, I... I think I know where we should get married. - Great.
thank you.
Hey. - Hey.
if you're not up for company, I could come back.
no, no, I am. Come on in.
how are you feeling?
I'm tired, but, you know, I'm actually not that bad.
hmm. Good. Or not good.
no, I... it's good.
mom, are you... are you angry about yesterday?
no.
I am... over it.
whatever it was, I'm over it.
you're the one that knows what's best for you, and whatever you want or don't want...
just tell me what to do, and I'll do it. - Mom, you're already doing it.
I feel like I'm not doing enough.
well, you can't cure me.
I wish I could pull every bit of that cancer out of you and put it in me instead.
I wish it were me.
I know. That's why I couldn't have you with me yesterday.
I didn't want to put you through that, and... and besides, if you cry, I cry.
did Sarah do okay?
Yeah, Sarah... Sarah did great.
just... aah. - What?
no, it's just this... this, uh, injection site is just pretty sore.
I don't know. Dr. Avadon said they're gonna maybe put in a chest catheter.
it makes it easier.
I don't want to cry.
it's okay.
you can cry.
I love you.
Hey.
Hey.
are you at a good place to take a break?
sure, if you can help me remember the erector spinae muscles.
Mm.
there's iliocostalis, uh, longissimus, spinalis.
I'm just trying to get a head start on next week's work.
I. L.S. Um... I love sex.
Erector. Sex.
Yeah. I'm into that.
I got it. I. L.S. What... what's going on?
okay, um, so you know how you said that,
you know, little girls play bride?
well, I... I didn't.
but I did play the isle of Awoka-Woka.
I would go outside with my little stuffed animal... Bradmore...
this little dolphin, and we'd great stranded...
Bradmore? - On a deserted island.
but instead of... instead of being sad, we would be happy, because, you know, there were palm trees and tiki torches
and... and coconut desserts, and it was just... it was perfect.
and it was everything that I ever wanted - on this... this little island. - Please tell me this means a wedding in Hawaii.
Oh, I love that. - Yeah?
I love that. - Yeah? I mean, you can surf.
Uh-oh. Maybe a little bit of this? Ooh.
Yeah. A little of that.
a little hula dancing. - Yeah.
a little bit of this.
look at your spinalis!
what do you say to people that think that Robert should suspend his campaign?
well, I would say that that would be a real tragedy for the people of California.
california needs Robert McCallister.
and he will be there for us. He'll be there for all of us.
you know, Robert needs to continue to fight his battle just like I need to continue to fight mine.
and I don't think you'll find either one of us cowering in the corner.
what is this? - Your polls going up.
her idea.
I also truly believe that Robert has this uncanny ability to stay focused...
even when he needs to make hard judgments.
you seem well, Kitty,
and I mean you sound incredibly positive in light of this difficult situation.
how do you achieve that?
with a lot of help.
I am surrounded by... by so much love and support.
ever since my diagnosis,
my husband, my mother, my siblings...
everybody has really...
really rallied around me.
Hey, mom. It's so funny you called.
I was just in this gorgeous patisserie.
they had those little pastries you love.
she's got what?
I'll be home tomorrow. Okay.
Sarah. What's wrong?
it's my sister. I've gotta go home.
I've gotta go. I'm sorry.
thank you for speaking with us today, Kitty.
well, thank you. It's my pleasure.
that was pundit and blogger Kitty Mccallister, the wife of senator Robert Mccallister, talking...
I thought we had an arrangement.
which one was that?
that you were gonna concentrate on getting well - and leave the campaigning to me. - Hmm. Right, right.
but you weren't holding up your end of the bargain.
it's not healthy for you.
you need to ignore it.
well, then you need to allow me to ignore it.
stop throwing the game.
that's your... your plan, right?
I'd still be a Senator.
I just wouldn't be in the middle of this campaign.
no, I know what this is about. This is about us.
this is about... this about us... before.
what if I'm not that guy anymore?
what if I don't want it at any cost?
because I know that you are the most important thing to me.
and I didn't know that before. And I...
I'm ashamed of that.
honey...
you don't owe me anything.
Yes, I do.
well, then you can't stop being an example.
what do you mean?
you never give up.
I don't want you to give up now.
please.
all right.
just a second.
pardon me. I'm lost.
I was wondering if you could help me.
Oh, my god.
Oh.
Hey, what's going on? This is justin.
keep it brief and I'll probably call you back.
Justin, hey. It's me.
um, listen, I know you're busy with midterms. Uh, I was just...
well, um, you know what? Just call me back.
I have something I really need to talk to you about, okay?
Bye.
I can't believe we're picking the mother of our child online.
I've never even hooked up with anyone online.
Really?
no, me neither.
once. - Right.
okay, ready to meet her? - Ready.
three, two, one.
Oh, my god.
Oh, wow. There's so many.
138 women are vying for our sperm.
Yeah, and they're gonna be menopausal. By the time we get through them.
Oh, look, we can whittle it down by checking some of those boxes. Try ethnicity.
Oh. I thought we didn't care.
we don't. Uh, eye color. Blue?
well, you just said you didn't care about ethnicity.
good point.
but, I mean, if you feel passionately about
no, no, no. I just--I just thought we would,
you know, it--it doesn't matter. Let's do height.
it's well documented that tall people
Great."5'5" or taller." here we go.
107. That's all right. We'll get through eventually.
how?
by going through each and every one of them.
Yeah, but what exactly are we looking for?
I'm sure they all have their pros or cons.
the best one, scotty.
right.
can you see the difference?
mom, you're so close. I can't see anything.
I should've taken a "before" picture.
I'm telling you. This stuff is a miracle.
you just dab it on, and I have the lashes of a 20 year old.
Wow. You really like this guy.
the eyelashes are for me, not for him.
no, we're just having lunch today So I can ask him about kitty's blood work.
he's an oncologist.
you're using kitty's cancer as a cover?
mom, that's just so skanky. - No, I am not.
I never, ever would do that. Not ever.
you know, we've had a few meals together. That's all.
no hanky-panky? - No!
okay. Sorry. Okay.
no. God, sarah. He's 20 years younger than I am.
but I think he wants to. It's weird.
don't you think that's weird?
no, i don't think it's wierd.
it would be weird if he wanted to have a family with you.
that wouldn't be weird. That would be impossible.
just be thankful that he's got A social security number and a job.
what are you talking about?
Luc has a job. He's an artist.
he's a painter. He paints.
is that why you came over here, To vent to me about your "live-in" boyfriend?
you know what his plans for today are?
laundry, market and maybe squeeze in a workout. Before he takes paige and coop over to joe's.
that sounds productive.
mom, it sounds like an au pair.
there are worse things than being an au pair. And besides that, you need one.
well, it sounds great. I know I should love it.
but I don't like who I become when I actually have one.
stop doing that. You're gonna rub the magic potion right off.
Sarah, listen to me. Luc is not joe.
Hey, saul.
she what?
okay, slow down.
all right. On the way.
Jane. She's reviewed our strategies. She's not happy.
how that woman became chair of the board, I will never know.
no one else wanted the job. Well...
Bye, mom.
maybe I should've given it to luck.
well, if you had, I would go to the meeting.
well, you can't. You've got a date.
we aren't entering anything into the competition?
I don't get it. This festival is a wonderful opportunity for brand exposure.
the press will be there, Chefs and retailers from around the country.
I mean, can we afford just to sit back and waste it?
we won't be wasting it.
we'll still have a very, very significant presence.
right, and we'll be pourin
the booth is magnificent, too, thanks to ryan and rebecca.
Oh, no problem.
what about this cheap blend? Where are we with that?
the coastal reserve? Well, it's coming along nicely.
and we are going to test it next quarter.
next quarter?
wasn't the whole point behind this hail-mary idea to bring us some revenue now?
Yes, I mean, that is the goal. But it takes time to launch a new wine.
this company doesn't have time.
well, we could taste it. S-see what we've got.
no, it's not ready. Saul
well, I-I don't know. Maybe we should taste it. Maybe that's a good idea.
at least we'll figure out what we've got.
what are we waiting for?
okay. Let's go for it.
Thanks. We just blended it recently.
I'm aware.
Cheers.
here we go.
I don't know.
I don't know what to say. This wine is, uh...
this wine is good.
it's amazing--the balance--It's--it's exquisite.
you're joking. - No, no. I'm not joking.
I-I-I think this wine should b tin the festival.
are you serious?
I'm serious. It needs to be tasted now.
I would go so far as to say that this wine should compete.
compete? - Yes, compete.
I don't think you understand.
this wine--this very wine-- is lightning in a bottle.
okay, but the festival's tomorrow.
all right, rebecca, sweetheart, do me a favor.
call joyce keenan at the festival office.
tell her that we have a red for the table wine class, okay?
and if there's any problem, you have her call me.
but what about a label? I could call some people we've already used or
Oh, my god. I've got an artist.
what do you mean?
well, he's french, from wine country.
is he available? - Absolutely.
well, it looks like. We are going to launch a wine overnight after all.
okay, cheers. Cheers.
here goes. - Cheers.
we need to be quiet.
my wife could be here at any minute.
d-do you like it?
do you think, um...
do you think maybe it's too short or
Mm. I think it's great.
Robert, you, um...
you have a flight to catch, right?
Oh, they'll wait.
I don't understand. Why would I want to do a label?
because when you think about it, It's just a small painting.
a very small painting.
Oh, come on. We'll pay you for it.
I don't need the money.
well, think of it as another creative outlet.
you know, like my ex--Joe--he only wanted to do his own music.
but then he got into doing jingles for commercials. And he absolutely loves it.
if this is successful, we'll be in wine spectator. And in every market on all the shelves.
so my painting next to a bag of chips?
no. No, no, no. That's a completely different aisle.
you're so talented and creative. I know you'll do something beautiful.
maybe. I don't know.
I'm sorry, but I don't paint on demand.
please... Let's have some lunch.
no, I can't have lunch. I have a deadline.
I know that you have your career in France,
but this could really open up some opportunities for you in this country.
this is not what I do.
what about your visa?
what about it?
well, have you thought about getting one?
you know, because with this kind of work, Ojai could sponsor you.
babe, I'm not worried about the visa. We have time.
would you just do it?
o-okay. I-I do it for you.
no, don't do it for me. Do it for you.
babe, I do a lot of things for myself. This one is for you.
Dr. Avadon said these look great. What do you think?
I think she's right.
Nora, doctors don't give good news to be nice.
no, I know. I--I'm sorry. I'm really not asking for a second opinion.
but you're an oncologist. It's hard for me not to want to pick your brain all the time.
she's your daughter. I completely understand.
I know you do. Thank you.
so I'm g--I'm putting these away... Far away.
L-let's take a long ride up p. C.H.
I know this wonderful little restaurant Way past malibu.
Oh. How about tomorrow?
Oh, I can't tomorrow. I've got the wine festival.
well, that sounds fun.
no, it's the family business. It's just... A lot of work.
a lot of work or... A lot of people you know?
what does that mean?
well, I'm just saying, We've gone to a lot of secluded places lately.
you're not embarrassed to be seen with me, are you?
God, no. No, no. Why would I be?
maybe because I'm younger than you.
Yes. No, I...I don't care about that.
come to the festival. Come.
I want you to come. You have to come.
I don't want o pressure you.
no, it's no pressure. It's no pressure. I really want you to come.
do you have something in your eye?
no, no, no, I have-it's an allergy.
why are you studying the spinal cord? That's not on the test.
is that a joke?
no. The exam is the upper extremities. The abdomen and the thorax.
the spinal cord runs through the abdomen and the thorax.
sorry, sorry, sorry.
Hey, did you get my message?
um, I... What's up?
nothing. I'm just--I've been trying to get ahold of you.
Justin-- - I know, I know.
you know? - Rebecca, you know,
I'm in--I'm in the study lab, And, I-I can't talk on the phone right now so
it's the posterior funiculus.
well, can you go outside and call me back?
I can't. I just found out the spinal cord's gonna be on the test, and there's a list of nerves. That I need to learn by tomorrow morning and where they go, so--I'm gonna have to call you back.
Justin-- - bye.
Bye.
good talk. We're pregnant.
sure that sarah isn't gonna be mad at me for not going to the festival?
no. It's not like you don't have a good excuse.
and I'm glad you're staying home with evan.
what are you doing?
it's this wig. It's this wig. Robert is crazy about this wig.
it's--it's like he's not having sex with me. He's having sex with her.
you make the wig sound like the other woman.
well, it... It kinda feels like that.
have you even let him see you without "her"?
God, no, mother. He doesn't need to be put through that.
sweetheart, he's your husband. He loves you.
you know, look, mom,
just because your romantic heart is very full right now. Doesn't mean that
what does that mean?
Oh. Sarah told me about motorcycle man.
well...I invited him to the wine festival. I-I had to.
he cornered me. I'm gonna call him. And I'm gonna cancel it.
Why?
because I could just imagine what everybody's gonna say.
Oh, look. Nora's with someone half her age. I wonder if she paid him.
you know, if you're not ready to do this, mom. Then you're not ready totho this.
I mean, everything happens on time. I really believe that.
look at me. I'm not ready to go without...Girlfriend here.
wait one minute. No.
you can't use me as an excuse to hide from your husband.
you know what? I'll make you a deal.
I will go to the wine festival with motorcycle man. If you kick girlfriend out of the bed.
is that a deal?
Kitty? - Okay, fine. Deal.
Yeah, let's do that. And let's keep the ukuleles.
I know, I canceled them before. But I think it would be so great and so hawaiian.
okay, great. Thanks. Bye.
ukulele players?
not for the festival. For the wedding.
Rebecca put music at the top of her list.
so that means that the luau dancers. And the tiki torches are back in, too?
David, it's not like I'm buying a yacht.
this is just entertainment for our daughter's wedding.
all right. I'll take that as a yes.
and I get it.
you know, last week, your portfolio was obliterated,
but now you're feeling optimistic. Because of your new wine.
Yeah. Wine that saul loved. Saul.
and sarah is being completely supportive of me,
which is something I never thought I would be able to say.
they are giving me a lot of support, a lot of leeway
a lot of rope.
no. That's not what this is.
Holly, this is your last option.
What--what if it doesn't work?
what if this wine is not the success that you need it to be?
no, it's gonna be.
and if you weren't missing the festival tomorrow, You would see that.
all right. Well, you better bring home a medal.
you know I will.
okay, what are we doing with diane--5'7," 116 pounds, mixed race?
Oh, put her on the short list.
she's 5'7."
no, not short in height. Like, you know, top five, top ten. I-I know what you meant.
could you pass the mint chip, please?
uh, we finished it.
okay, we need to stop eating. We need to get out of this apartment.
we can't. We have another 76 to go.
wait. Look. Di diane's never bn on a team before.
so?
so what if she's a genius with social issues?
what good is it being the smartest kid on the playground if you have no friends?
whre are you doing?
I'm sorry. I can't do this anymore. I mean, this is...This is weird.
most couples, they just--they just do it. And they get what they get.
Yeah, after marrying someone they've considered carefully.
well, you know what? In different circumstances,
I would happily marry any one of these women.
I'm just trying to give our kid the most advantages possible.
is this what it's gonna be like?
what? - When we have an actual child.
when is good gonna be good enough?
how many hours are you gonna make them practice piano or do their multiplication tables?
what about you?
they're gonna have a hard time writing their college essay,
you know, are you just gonna say,"oh, forget it. It's too hard. Let it go"?
okay, I'm getting some fresh air.
that's my point. You just walk away.
Oh, can you at least bring back some mint chocolate chip?
Hey. Please tell me, you're on your way home.
I'm sorry. I think I'm gonna have to pull an all-nighter.
I don't know if I can go to your festival tomorrow either.
I can't believe this.
look, if you're stressed about the festival, It's gonna be fine.
no, justin, I am not stressed out about the festival.
okay. Then what is it?
I don't want to talk about it on the phone.
that's why I wanted you to come home tonight.
you know what? You're making it sound as if I want to be here.
this sucks. - You have no idea.
Rebecca, if this is about work, I'm sorry.
but I can't take on your stress, too.
I'm not asking you to take on my stress. All I've ever asked you to do is just show up occasionally.
well, you're gonna have to give that up for a while, Because you're gonna be disappointed.
okay, you know what? I-I give up. Let me know when you can fit me in.
of course.
Oh, there you are.
Oh, how's it going?
it's coming.
can I see it?
no.
come on. It's due tomorrow.
Oh, my god. You finished the whole bottle?
well, to make a label, you need to know the wine.
by the way, it's delicious.
I'm glad you liked it.
can I at least see what you've done so far?
it's not ready.
look, I-I just want to see it, Even if it's not completely ready.
all right. Like I said... it's not ready.
these are great.
this one? Perfect.
it-- it's not finished, sarah.
now I know you have incredibly high standards.
Yeah, you're right. I do.
trust me. I know. This is good.
you're just insecure.
insecure? I am insecure?
you think you know everything, don't you
when the painting is done, if it's good enough...
the way I feel?
here. It's yours.
Luc-- - Have fun with it.
I'm going.
look at this, It reminds me of when I had Backstage passes at a beatles' concert.
Wow. You saw the beatles, huh?
well, I-I don't remember much. I was very young.
um, so I told you, I--I'm going to really have to move around
and schmooze all around here today.
so why don't you get some wine?
and I'll meet you over at the walker landing booth, Where-where-wherever it is.
Oh, there's--um, she's-- she's a woman on the board.
now I-I-I told you. I'm gonna tve to work today.
Nora, I get it. Okay. Work the room. I'll catch you later.
Jane. - Hello, nora.
how are you? Exciting about the wine.
Yes. - Who was that?
who? Oh, that handsome young man.
well, he's a doctor. Simon craig is his name.
Oh, is sarah dating him?
no. Sarah is dating a french artist, actually.
Oh, right. The one who did the label.
Ah, youth. They have all the fun.
what's the point of living, huh, jane?
excuse me. I have to find my family.
Oh, mom.
so... scotty and I, We've narrowed our egg choices to a top 20...
all of which are unbelievably strong contenders.
well, you make it sound like a reality show.
Yeah, well, I don't want to trivialize it or make a mistake,
and scotty seems to have washed his hands of the whole thing.
so I would like you to meet kimberly. - Hi, I'm kimberly.
I like to travel and exercise...
I like to travel and exercise."Cute, right?
I'm very driven, and in the next five years, I hope to complete my J. D.M. B.A. after which, I'd like to open my own storefront legal aid clinic.
you memorized her?
Oh, yeah. I've memorized all of them.
my only problem with kimberly is her grandfather had a stroke when he was 40,
but she is 21, so strong selling point.
you know, some people think women are like wine. They get better with age.
not the fertility clinics. They tell you not to even consider anyone over 25.
all right, all right. I know that.
Kevin, I-I just don't feel like I want to make an important decision like this over wine.
why not? It's never stopped our family before.
you know, get yourself a glass, kevin. You look naked.
here we go. Here we go.
I think you'll find this a little more fruit forward, Not as much structure in it.
Hey, rebecca. Can I have two more bottles of wine, please?
can I have two more bottles?
Oh, sorry. Um, I didn't get much sleep last night.
okay, I'll make you a deal
I'll send you a case of our pinot over to your hotel If you'll consider us for your wine list.
come on. 'cause you know we' always wanted a crack at it.
Luc. You came.
of course I come.
uh, uh, jeffrey, this is luc laurent.
Luc is from bordeaux. And he's been doing some work for us.
actually, he did our label for our new coastal reserve.
it's great. - Right?
Yeah, it really--it really pops. - Thank you.
see? I told you it was great.
Jeffrey's group owns some beautiful boutique hotels.
I bet you're always looking for hot, new graphic designers.
sure-- logos, stationery, soap.
soap.
well, you know, it's just a--just a start.
seriously, jeffrey, he isamazing. He can do anything.
Sarah, I don't mean to interrupt.
I need to talk to you. Excuse me.
would you excuse me?
Oh, did I tell you? He turned the label around in one day.
amazing. Okay.
she's a good agent.
trouble is, I thought she was my girlfriend.
are you looking for your doctor friend?
because he is over there talking to my daughter.
so what's the story? Is he married, gay?
definitely not either.
good,'cause I think they're really hitting it off. Don't you?
they're talking, jane.
that's how these things start, nora.
now I know it's-- it's been a while,
but I'm telling you, I'm sensing chemistry.
well, your senses are off, jane, way off,
because he's completely in love with me.
what?
it's been a few weeks now,
and the attention's great, But it is getting to be a bit much.
I mean, I'm just glad he's finally mingling. So that I can have some space.
I do have my concerns.
as you so aptly pointed out, he's somewhat younger,
but let me tell you, that does have its advantages.
and I will refrain from describing to you in public
Oh, jane, oh, jane, oh, jane.
then it does have its downside. He's a bit immature.
you remember what 40-something guys were like.
Oh, oh, maybe you don't. Your husband is quite a bit older, isn't he?
I hope you're not too disappointed about lucy.
I'm sure she'll snag some guy one day soon.
and, you know, when I break it off with him,
I'll make sure he has her phone number. How's that?
Hey, gorgeous. You mind if I steal my lovely lady away?
thank you, jane.
Immature-- that's the problem?
Oh, god. I'm sorry. I just, you know
you were amazing.
I was?
see, in boxing terms, We'd call that a technical knockout.
did I say I wanted to design a soap?
I guess I just don't understand.
what's wrong with getting money r for doing something you love?
I love painting, sarah. It's enough for me.
I just don't understand why it is not enough for you.
well, it's not enough for the I. N.S.
there's so many different ways to have a visa. Than actually designing soaps.
is there? Like what?
I mean, have you even looked into it?
because from what I'm hearing. They're not exactly giving them away anymore.
why do you need to know this right now?
because I need to know what this is.
what are we, luc?
Sarah, you always try to label everything--Us, wine, soaps.
Yeah, I guess that's what grown-ups do.
that's how we know something's real.
I'm under a lot of pressure right now, luc.
my family's business could go under any day.
and I need to know if I really have a partner.
I flew 6, 000 miles to be with you, sarah.
you asked me to help you with the label. I did.
I do laundry, help with the kids.
if anything ever go wrong, I will be there for you.
Yes, but-- - but what, sarah?
is it the money, the problem? I don't make enough for you?
no, no.
my art sells really well in France.
and if I stay here with you, it will sell here, too.
I know where this is going. I've been down this road before
feeling like I'm the only one taking responsibility.
c-can't you just be happy?
it just sounds so naive.
well, to me, that sounds cynical.
well... Luc, wait.
you know, have a great time in the festival.
yo you know, and I-I hope the wine does well. I-I really do.
Luc? Come on, you...
first of all, I'd just like to say that
all of the judges here today Were very impressed with this class.
we had a hard time judgi, Which, for us, isn't usually the case.
anyhow, without further ado, The top prize for the table wine class
it's the coastal reserve from walker landing.
Sarah! Sarah, me here. We won!
we won! We won! This is unbelievable!
it's amazing. Oh, my god. I can't believe it.
okay, nora, nora, get in here.
come on. Just get in.
everyone a bit closer.
you on the side, little, uh, closer to your mom, please.
okay. Everyone, say cheese.
Mm. That's very nice.
all right, now that you're officially the greatest judge in the world. Take a look at these.
tell us which one should be our egg donor.
what am I looking at?
Caitlin. Strong grades, but more of an athlete.
runs marathons. Wins marathons. Probably not gonna give us an einstein,
but, you know, more of a socialized, popular kid.
health okay?
Absolutely. They don't make it on to the list unless it's okay.
look, kevin, I know there's a lot of pressure on you guys.
and I certainly understand asl ell as anyone
that there was a day in your life when it hit you
that you would probably never raise a family, right?
right. - But now you're both gonna be dads.
and you want it to be right. You want it to be perfect.
well, close would be fine. - Yes.
you know that wine of ours that just won?
of course.
it shouldn't have been that good. Those grapes were nothing special.
but it is fantastic.
and that's what I love so much about making wine
the surprise when you get much more than you put in.
they tell me that parenting is very much like that
seeing your child turn into something that you would never have predicted.
and now if you'll excuse me,
I am going to taste a Cabernet Sauvignon that I hear great things about.
here you are.
Yes, I'm cheating. I'm drinking the competition.
the hell with it.
you okay?
no. I'm not okay.
is this about that stupid photographer?
it's about the photographer and jane And my brother myd my children.
whoa. What--what are you talkibg about?
what am I--you know what I'm talking about.
it's the first thing people see Whenever they look at us together.
you're in your 40s, and I'm... Obviously not.
I thought you didn't ce.
well, I do care. Why are you with me?
you could be with anyone.
you're a gorgeous, straight 40-year-old doctor. Who travels the world.
47
well, that changes everything.
Nora, you're right. There's obviously an age difference.
Yes, I am a doctor. I travel to some insane places.
but that's because I live my life
without any rules, way outside the box.
no. The way I want to.
you're a beautiful, smart, passionate woman. That is why I'm with you.
and this doesn't bother you?
no.
you know, the only thing that troubles me Is your address.
my address?
you lived your whole life in pasadena.
you play it safe.
that's the only thing that's telling me to question. Anything about us.
well, this is-- this is crazy.
we--we are in completely different stages of our lives.
I have five grown children, four grandchildren.
you've never even been married.
okay. Well, I'm sorry I invited myself here.
you didn't invite yourself. I invited you.
no. You didn't want me here. You wanted to play it safe.
I just thought maybe you'd want to know
why holly didn't accept your offer to buy stock out.
Holly thinks this is what's gonna turn ojai around,
this, uh, coastal reserve?
Yeah, they think it's gonna be, like, a huge hit for them.
this wine does real business, I'll never have a shot at ojai.
seeing as how you stand to benefit nicely if I get this company,
I think you should be thinking about how to help fix the situation.
I am so proud of you guys.
your mom is practically singing show tunes, She's so happy.
Oh, thanks.
What--what did justin say?
um, I'm not supposed to bother him when he's studying.
what's going on, bec?
nothing.
Oh, no, come on. You gotta talk to me. What's wrong?
I'm pregnant.
Oh, s-sweetie.
Yeah, six weeks.
I haven't told anybody yet.
what about justin?
are you kidding me? Vei've tried.
U you know what? Iprs probably better that I haven't.
what does that mean?
he's already told me he doesn't want a baby
obviously that was before you knew you were pregnant.
what do you want?
I don't know.
well, you have to figure that out.
I will support you, whatever--whatever you decide.
I'm gonna be there for you. But when you do...
then you have to talk to him.
I know.
I can't believe my ride drove off into the sunset on his motorcycle.
I can't believe you turned up to the wine festival
on a motorcycle in that dress.
it wasn't easy, And apparently not enough to impress the doctor,
who says I live in a box. Because I'm a little hung up about the age difference.
a lot hung up, mom.
well, it's embarrassing.
Why? - I-I don't know. I mean
I mean, who am I kidding? Who the hell do I think I am?
I feel like one of those old ladies with botox
trying to stuff myself into a pair of skinny jeans.
or it's like dating some undocumented french guy.
no, it's not. It's not anything like that.
I don't know, mom. You know what?
if I'm really honest with myself,
I think maybe I'd be less anxious and better off with a regular guy who has a regular paycheck and a visa.
you know, I really,
I pushed him on that wine label.
now I feel like a pushy, corporate dream dasher. All over again.
Luc is not joe.
he's at the opposite end of the men spectrum.
Luc is--is kind and happy. And he's not trying to be someone he isn't.
no, I know. Don't get me wrong.
I mean, he's adorable. He's a great guy.
but the main thing is, he showed up there,
even though you bullied him about the label.
see? I bullied him. I hate that.
and a lot of guys would not have done that,
including joe, who would've stayed home and sulked.
but your boyfriend came there to show you his support Because he...
must love you or like you a lot.
more importantly, I think he likes himself.
and you know what? Finding someone like that is the holy grail of relationships.
I'm an idiot.
you know what? Simon's an idiot. I don't live in a box.
tell him.
tell him.
all right. I will.
what are you doing? - S--I'm sorry.
look. I'm s--I'm sorry.
I... Look, I've--I've put all the finalists up.
I thought maybe we could throw darts at them.
I don't think throwing darts at women's faces is a good idea.
you were right. You were absolutely right.
any one of them would be great. So please pick a dart.
wait. Is this a joke or does your o. C.D.
actually run on some sort of fuel that you're out of?
no. I just realized that the way I've been approaching this...
it's as if caitlin here wins marathons. Because she has long legs.
whereas really, at mile 22, when everyone else is dropping,
she digs deeper because someone in her life taught her never to give up
set an example, made her that way.
Caitlin--any of those girls-- they'll give us a healthy baby.
who that child turns out to be...Is up to us.
that's what I'm excited about,
because I can't wait to see the result of us being dads.
me neither.
on three?
maybe we should roll dice.
Nora-- - come here. I want to show you something.
now let's see.
one, two, three, four, five. Right here.
this is the step where my son justin Split his head open when he was wasted out of his mind.
and--and out there is the swimming pool. Where my husband drowned on my daughter's birthday.
up there in the very first bedroom is where I'm nursing kitty through chemo.
it's the very same bedroom that sarah stayed in. When she was going through her divorce.
and in there is the living room. Where my son kevin married his partner scotty.
so this is the box I live in.
it's not med school, but it's not playing it safe either.
I shouldn't have said it like that.
no, you were right.
I am hung up about our age difference.
you remind me of my husband.
no.
no, in a good way. You are...
you're charming and exciting. And unpredictable, Just like he was.
the difference is, he didn't take me along for the ride.
and I find it hard to believe you want to.
I do.
do you feel like everyone's watching us?
Yes. Let them watch.
Jennifer knox from the "wine spectator
wants to do a feature on our coastal reserve...For the next issue.
how about that?
well, apparently, I have calls to return From "food & wine..."
Yes. - And "bon appetit.
that's wonderful. I have to say, holly, we're indebted to you.
you know, when a company goes through. The kind of crises we've been through,
it's very easy to hunker down and stick to core values.
but what's really needed is an open mind, new ideas.
and that's what you did.
and that's why ojai is gonna prosper.
and next time, I will have your back from the get-go.
Holly harper.
I'm sorry. What?
how could this have happened? Oh.
Oh, my god.
Holly, wow
that's all there is, saul.
there's nothing left.
I'm just making petit dejeuner.
what's with the bag?
I'm going home, sarah.
Oh, come on. Listen, yesterday, I-I wanted to...
talk to you last night, but
you and I can go on for years,
pretending the difference between us is not important,
but it is.
no, no. Listen, listen.
I have a lot of baggage from my lousy marriage.
but, um, I'm gonna shed it. I mean, consider it shed.
maybe I had to go through this whole, uh, label debacle
this is not about the label.
since I got here, you've been asking me, what's my plan and all.
Oh, I know. And you don't have one.
and that's okay with me now.
and it's, uh...
it's not easy for me to... Let life unfold,
but... I'm gonna try to do that.
that's easy for you to say.
no no, it's not, actually.
I love you, luc.
I love you, too, sarah.
so tut the bag down.
I don't want us to start hating each other.
Oh, my god. You're breaking up with me.
Oh, I can't believe this is happening.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you.
no, I'm...
my taxi. Um...
here, this is for paige and coop.
thank you.
Oh. I am gonna sleep until January.
how was it?
Oh, I'll tell you one thing, There was a lot of spinal cord on there.
how was the, uh, how was the festival?
Oh, it was good. We won.
you won? Yeah. That's great. That must make you feel better.
Hey, look, I-I just want to say, I'm sorry for rocking on you.
I know I flaked on a lot of things, For a lot of lame reasons, but this is different.
Rebecca, I need to be totally committed If I'm gonna pull through this.
and... There are gonna be times where I'm not gonna be there for you.
you know, I--I'm trying to learn all this stuff at the same time,
and it becomes too much.
you... You understand that, right?
Yeah. D-definitely.
now I've been eating Vending machine food for three days.
so I think I'm gonna go make myself something real. You want anything?
no, I'm good. Thanks.
Hey, I'm home!
I'm sorry I'm late. There was a lot of turbulence.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
a-aren't you gonna say anything?
Yeah. It's good to be home.
no, no, robert, robert, I...
I don't have any hair.
I know.
no, I'm--I'm bald.
and beautiful.
you mean, you're...
you're not gonna run screaming the other way?
no.
well, because I...
I thought that maybe it was all about the wig,
and--and I-I don't want it to be about the wig. I want it to be about me, and I
I love you
for reasons that have nothing to do with your hair.
you're beautiful.
I'm parading?

I'll talk to them.
don't be mad, husband.
I am so many things right now,
do mad is one of them...
but not at you.
it's bad.
it's really, really bad.
look at me.
no one's giving up, Right?
right.
I want to see evan.
I'll see what I can do.
I've been running all around - telling everybody you're fine
if it makes you feel better, I've already yelled at her.
Robert, I'm not yelling at her.
I know that the results of the N.M.R. aren't what we wanted,
but not everybody responds to the same course of treatment.
and so normally,
but your cancer is progressing at a rate that troubles me.
so I talked to some of my colleagues, and we all agree that in your case,
a bone marrow transplant might really be the way to go.
bone marrow? But that's so aggressive.
okay, it's hard to talk statistics
because every case is different.
mm, the chemo has proven to be problematic. I mean, that's true.
uh, the bone marrow could prove to be curative.
but there are some serious risks involved.
well, tell us-- tell her the risks.
there's infection. There's internal bleeding.
your--your body could reject the transplant.
I mean, not everybody survives the procedure.
rightg right. I-I-I understand the risks.
but... What--what are the rewards?
well, that's the good news.
I mean, well, if everything goes
you could be living cancer free.
shoudn't she just try a different kind of chemo,
and if that doesn't work, then move on to this?
but if the chemo proves unsuccessful again,
then she's that much weaker.
when she has the bone marrow transplant. And that could seriously increase her chances
mom. Mom, cancer free.
the chemo isn't working, and I have a little boy at home.
and you got to do it all.
you got to take us to school and you got to watch us grow up,
you got to-- to see us get married.
I want to do all that.
you've swung for the fences.
if this is what you want, I'm with you.
mom?
Kitty, is this really what you want?
I want
okay. What should we do?
well, I have to stress that, in a situation like this,
weeks, I mean, even days, could make a difference.
and none of this happens until we find a... - Match.
a match. - I know.
well, it's a good thing you had so many kids.
uh, so how was the wedding? Sorry I didn't make it.
Oh, doesn't matter. The wedding never happened.
Kitty... Well, uh, she's in the hospital.
Oh, my god. Is she okay? - She'll be fine.
good. So why'd you want to see me on a Sunday?
I need you to explain something. - Okay.
well, it turns out that the coastal reserve spill was not an accident.
what? - The valves on the tanks had been tampered with.
I mean, d-do--? do you have any idea Who might have done that?
not yet. But we know exactly peen it happened.
I got a call from the investloators today,
the only person in and out of the building... Was you.
look, I don't know whatou're trying to say, but if you think it was
I know that you have a complicated relationship with the walkers.
we have that in common.
was that your way of getting
what he did to your mother was awful
no.
Ryan, I am giving you the chance to come clean here.
I am being honest with you.
you understand that this a legal matter now,
and there is nothing that I can do to protect you?
I don't need you to protect me.
OK.
I didn't do anything wrong.
so this is what sit at your computer?
uh, yeah. I just watch You Tube videos.
Ah, okay. Lee's go eat.
as soon as I cancel To the security institute.
Oh, would you please stop e-mailing me? - Who is it?
Oh, it's this firm we hiesd to do internal opposition research.
you know, when you run for office,
Yog have to find out what the other guy can dig up on you.
Oh, what kind of stuff are you digging for?
unpaid taxes, controversial quotes from old colleague essays,
that kind of thing.
the guy who owns the company-- lewis-a?
he is-- he's totally out of control.
he's now trailing robet.
he's meant to be researching public record,
no on a spy mission.
Yeah, well, that's the problem.
he keeps sending me these updates about a place in westwood.
apparently robert's been making biweekly visits to a house.
but you know what? I'm not gonna worry about it,
because I can promise you, Robert has a perfectly good reason for being Westwood.
I'm not even gonna ask him cbout it because I'm not worried.
the problem is, you sound worried.
hay, mom.
why, what's up?
Yeah, sure. We can come
okay. Yeah, bye.
what's wrong? - I have to get a blood test.
what if none of us are a match?
to be honest, I'm worried about what happens when one of us is a match.
Sarah, this procedure is a lot riskier than chemo.
Hey, guys. What's the status?
um, we've all been tested,
and, uh, tommy's results are being sent down from seattle.
Yeah, okay. Oh, sarah, kitty wants to see you.
hang in there. Okay.
Hey, you get a minute? - Sure. How you holding up?
good, good.
um... There's something I want you to look into for me.
anything. - I think I'm being followed.
what makes you. Ay that? - Because there's a guy following me.
An'she's not very good at it. I wrote down the make and model of his car,
license plate number, a general description of the guy.
wow, he isn't very good, is he?
Yeah, I'm sure he's the worst reporter, but you can never be too careful.
sure. No problem.
so thank you.
I don't think I could get through this without you.
I'll take care of this.
Oh, excuse me.
finally, you're awake when I visit.
Sarah, are you?
because I can't take it if anybody else is mad at me.
how could I be mad at you?

I'm sorry. I can't be funny right now.
look, I know I should be cautious, but you know what? Ryan matched.

well, good enough to d from thinking about bone marrow.
well, what is it?
I can't tell you.
no, I can't. I. Ain't. I'll just say
that it has nothing to do with kitty's health.
is it scandalous? - Completely.
okay, sarah, we all know how this is tenna end.

so kitty had a dalliance with this married man.
Kitty did? - A long time ago, when she first got to washington.

I've done some research, Ptions, okay? Pl she can try other kinds of chemo.
please, please. Look, it's not a big procedure for you.
honestly, it's--it's like a needle stick,
a couple of hours, and then you're home.
take two aspirin, you'll feel better in the morning.
use me and be done with me. Isn't that what you guys like to do?
Ryan, what did we ever do to you?
WE--WE--WE tried to be a family to you.
I brought you down here. I invited you to live with me.
Sarah hunt you a job. Saul has taken you under his wing.
I'll send you a thank-you note from the end.
did we not pay you enough attention?
I'm sorry. Kitty got sick,
and then justin's came up and
I don't care about the wedding-- - is it rebecca?
do you still have feelings for rebecca?
Yeah, that's what this is all about. - cut the sarcasm!

according to the blood tret, ryan, you are.
I'm out of here.
Oh, god. It's william, isn't it?
it's william? I mean, it didn't make any sense.
how could a nice guy like you, a good person,
not want to sa kitty's life?
I told you, I don't want to talk about him.
then let's talk about evan.
he's just an innocent little kid, same way you were,
and he is the one that will be most affecte by this
stop. You do not know what you're talking about.
Yes, I do. - He used my mother and then her out like she was nothing,
and she killed herself because of im.
this's the person that you were married to.

Oh, robert. Stop.

what if I never see him again?
you will. You will. I promise.
Oh, god, I'm scared. Oh, god.
I didn't know what to say. I just stood there.
I went there with the intention of chaining the kid to the gurney if I had to,
and then he said that about william,
and my god, no wonder he hates us.
well, that probably explains why he wanted to sabotage ojai, right?
I wish there was a law that could just make him do this.
what am I gonna say to kty?
she's about to renew her vow, for god sakes. I can't tell her.
well, they should search the--the bone marrow registry
or your marrow or even my marrow.
what, nora? - We're too old. That's why.
Ryan. - So, uh, where do I go?
you're gonna do it?
I couldn't let another kid grow up without his mother.
that's great. Okay, you-- you stay right here.
and I'll--I'll--I'll have them page the doctor. Okay.
okay. Well, let's go sit down.
Nora. - Yeah?
how did you stop hating him?
I don't know that I have stopped hating him.
but
I haven't stopped loving him either.
Ryan, listen,
you have to surround yourself with people who care about you,
and then one day, you'll wake. And it will just be a distant thought.
it won't anymore.
I promise.
so when you were sleeping with he who shall not named...
he wasn't voldemort. We'll just call him the silver fox.
do you see what you started, sarah?
look, this story will not leave this family, okay? Trust me.
Oh, I'm sorry, but I don't trust any of you.
okay, and if you don't keep still, You're gonna look like lady gaga.
I lo - oh, she's a hack.
you're a hack. - Ooh, burn.
what, are you gonna put me in a full nelson now?
Oh, I can't believe I missed tha--fight.
will you--will you do a rematch for me?
anytime, anyplace.
Cole on. Can we get back to the silver fox, please?
Oh, I can't believe my sister's is part of our con'try's history.
it wasn't all about the sex. That part only lasted a month.
I think I was his muse.
his muse? - Oh, muse.
Yes, his muse. I inspired him.
did he inspire you?
well, as a matter of lact, he did.
he was the reason I got into broadcasting and think tanks.
Oh, there you go.
Yeah, I mean, except for, I went to washington to get into politics,
you know, to be in the ge.
ended up in the booth.
you know, it's funny.
today robert asked if I had any regrets, And I said no.
but I think maybe I do.
it's never too late, kit.
Mm. Yeah, yeah, no. But I probably should... get married first.
Yeah, not without your diva blush.
there. Doesn't she look beautiful? - She does.
Unea. I'm gonna tell robert you're ready
okay, I'm gonna go ? get mama.
are you sure you're okay with this?
Oh, totally. I-I talked to Robert. Rebecca and are-- are fine.
how are you? Are you scared?
Ah. I mean, we've already done it once.
not the marriama. The transplant.
Oh. Oh, well, yeah.
Yeah. No, I'm really scared,
but I-I do believe it's the right thing to do.
yo on the other hand, don't look so sure.
no, no, no, no.
look... We were sworn to be relentlessly positive.
but...
you know, it's a major procedure. - I know.
why do you think I'm - oh, kitty, just please don't-- - Ur oh, it is, though, justin.
it is. Of course. It's okay.
I love you.

don't hit me.
I'm so... You'd think I'd never done this before
I mean, getting married.
they say three's the charm. May I?
there you go.
not with a sprained wrist.
I take, I owe you an apology-- - ah, screw it.
you know, we were both under pressure.
Yeah, which is when people show the truth
and that's--that's why I didn't trust you,
because if I were in your position,
I don't know what I would've done.
you kidding me? You took a swing at a guy that could defending your sister's honor.
you're capable of anything.
you know, I still think that fight was pretty even.
Kitty, repeat after me.
I, kitty, take you, robert, to be my husband.
I, Kitty, take you, robert, to be my husband... Again.
I, robert, take you, kitty, to be my wife agai to have and to hold from this day forward...

Oh, god. How is she?
she's sleeping.
we made it over the first hurdle.
she's accepted the transplant. - Thank god.
okay. Good. So--so-- so what happens next?
well, we wait.
good afternoon.
this ie one of the most difficult things I've ever had to do.
three weeks later
as m earlier this year,
she was diagnosed with stage 3 a lymphoma.
after several rounds of chemotherapy,
she underwen bone marrow transplant.
and based on her latest tests,
I can tell you tha beaten the odds,
and she is in remedy
so sorry we're late. Look who I have.
Oh, ryan. Just in time. To
come on, ryan. Take an bow. My hero. Take a bow.
wait. Who is he talking about?
and at the beginning of this difficult journey,
both kitty and I insisted that While we had a tough fight at home,
and to bring this amazing state into remission as well.
nice metaphor. - Oh, I think it's beautiful.
I think I just lost my place as favor- definitely.
so many of us go this
so focused on the goal ahead of us
Thatexe forget what's important is right next to us.
I almost lost my partner,
my better half.
and... It reminded me
that my respsibility,
first and foremost, is to my family.
my supporters in this campaign
and my loved one with equal measure.
and so...
RN in service to the state of california
the republican party and family,
I today withdraw my bid for goverber.
what?
well, I-I told you that you wouldn't want to miss it.
Oh, what a great fire.
Yeah.
Yeah, all we need is some marshmallows and graham crackers and chocolate.
Oh, I think I have all of those.
mom... I'm kidding.
it's perfect. I don't need anything.
and isn't that amazing?
Yeah. Yeah, is it amazing?
I can't even believe it.
I'm gonna get to see him going to prchool.
Yeah.
preschool, and the eighth grade,
the 11th grade,
and I'm warning you, it ain all pretty.
Yes, it is, mom. It's all pretty.
Oh, god.
and suddenly, everything is amazing.
it is the best fire,
this is the best tea,
and you are the best mother.
what? That doesn't sound annoying. It sounds veryccurate.
what are you gonna with this second chance, is new lease on life?
a I don't know, but I'm certainy not gonna waste my time.
and, you know, There are just so... So many things I want to do.
sometimes when I look at other peoples. And their lives
and everything they've accomplished
and... I haven't,
and then I...
I know not a single day has been wasted...
that and what's important are all the days still to come.
Yeah.
are those the infamous letters?
of course. Of course they told yo
Yes, but they don't tell me who wrote them.
but I will get way out of them eventually.
I'm sure you will.
what are you gonna do
I don't know. I don't know. You know, it... It's funny,
because. They're not at all what I remember them to be.
I don't know. I was so young,
and it's like they were written about somebody else.
so let's go to bed
Yeah, you know, I think I'm go wait up for robert.
good night.
Dan, listen, you raised $1. 3 million for me when I started out, and Kitty's twice the candidate I was then.
so let's have some steaks. Let's talk about it.
uh, no. Tonight? Not tonight. We're having dinner at mom's.
Oh, I can't get to mom's. I'm seeing a movie with Roy. - A movie?
no, check now, and... and I'll hold. - Yeah. Why?
because that's all the two of you seem to be doing lately.
I mean, Sarah, don't you think it's a little weird that you've been dating this guy for over a month
and you... you haven't, you know, done any more?
no. No, Kitty, I don't.
I'm looking for a relationship, not a fling.
I mean, how long did you and Robert know each other before you guys hooked up?
hmm. Honey, how many dates did we have before we had sex?
Oh, I... I don't know. Um, one?
did he just say "one" ?
no, not one. That... that was in your dreams.
well, I... I mean, we were working together, - and, you know, then it sorta happened. - Oh, it didn't just sort of happen.
he totally put it in the books. - Me? What about you, with the high heels and the push-up bra?
you knew it was sexy time... Oh, hi, Dan.
Oh, good. We're on. Great. All right. Thanks.
I gotta go. - Whoa. Whoa. Wait.
Dan Lewis... on the hook for a million. - Wow, $1 million.
I mean, these people are throwing money at me, Robert, - and I don't even know who they are. - Well, they know who you are,
they know what you're running on, and they want in.
Yeah, meanwhile my own family doesn't even know I'm running.
you haven't told 'em? - Not that I'm running for your senate seat.
well, don't you think it's bad form for them to hear about it at the press conference?
that is a very good point.
I'm gonna tell 'em tonight.
good. And, Kitty, tell them. Don't ask 'em.
well, of course.
bet they turn this place into a clothing store after we leave.
Scotty, this place is not gonna close.
it's just a slow time.
no, they're gonna put the jeans over there, and the sweater rack over there for the lightweight knits.
are we just gonna stand around and have a pity party all afternoon or are you gonna help me with this event?
honestly?
Oh, Scotty, listen to me.
you have a full house tomorrow night. - Oh.
you have two great guest chefs...
the mayor and me. - Yeah.
and it's gonna be fabulous.
and gray skies are gonna clear up.
sunny days ahead. You'll see. Hmm.
Hello?
optimistic?
okay, thank you.
so much for sunny days.
that's the mayor, and he's snowed in... in Chicago.
they booked him on a flight tomorrow, and they're "optimistic" that he can make it here on time.
even god wants this restaurant to close.
just stop. Let's not panic, okay? We're gonna...
what's wrong with him? - He's a little low.
would you remind him that this restaurant is his baby?
you can't give up on it. - Oh, the baby!
mom, can you avoid using the "b" word?
we find out Monday if Michelle's pregnant.
and we're all a little on edge. - I'm not gonna be able to provide for our family.
I'm gonna be living in my car again with a baby.
no one is gonna be living in your car.
and you know what? Let's be honest here, Scotty.
you're just the head chef here. This puppy could go down, and you could get another job anywhere, just like that.
but you won't have to because tomorrow night, we're all gonna wow Pasadena's finest with some culinary magic
no, not "we" you're going to your reunion.
what reunion? - It's his 20th reunion. He says he's not going.
I'm not. - You're not going to your reunion?
he's petrified. - I'm not petrified. I'm disdainful.
there's a difference. - He's petrified.
he did not have a good higschool experience. - Thanks, Scotty.
whoa. Kevin, I'll go to your reunion.
did you know one of your classmates is "playboy" bunny?
Oh, let me guess. Linda Perlmutter.
Linda Perlmutter. - Yeah.
Oh, do you remember, she developed very early? - Like in kindergarten.
what are you, jealous?
Kevin, why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?
it's like a rite of passage.
Yeah, so is circumcision.
saul, it... it was the mullet.
Kevin had a mullet? - No.
Yeah, so did Sarah. - Yeah, at least my bangs didn't go up.
Uh-oh. Somebody's back early.
guess that means no nooky.
are you all tracking my sex life?
no, we're just looking out for you.
Yeah, but if he hasn't tried to jump your bones by now, he's gay.
or he has anS.T.D.
or like the book says, "he's just not that into you." - "he's just not that into you.
personally, I think it's very sweet that you decided to take your time.
thank you, uncle Saul. - Mm-hmm.
I'm trying to have a grown-up relationship with a grown-up.
and if that means we don't jump into the sack off the bat, - so be it. - Mm-hmm.
now what's this I hear about you not going to your high school reunion? That's stupid.
Yeah, it is crazy. I mean, if anybody shouldn't go to their high school reunion, it's me.
remember how I lost my bid for president senior year?
it was the biggest upset in the history of West San Marino high school as I recall.
after that she begged us to homeschool her the rest of the year.
send me to a convent. Anything.
you know, I seriously still can't believe that...
that what was his name...
stephen Lewinsky... that he beat me.
stephen Lewinsky. Oh, what a dreamboat.
all of the Lewinskys were.
you had one in your year, right, Kevin? - Yeah, Brent. Don't remind me.
Oh, wait, wait. Brent Lewinsky, right?
Oh, no. He's not going. You don't have to worry.
is there a recent picture of him?
Yeah. Let me see. Let me see. - Oh, of course.
he's still annoyingly hot. - That's why his brother won, you know?
he was a student. - Yeah, well, I wouldn't worry about the, uh, guy you're running against in the 54th.
he's ugly. - Well, actually, I'm not running against him anymore.
you're dropping out already?
no, I'm still running for office.
I'm just running for a different one.
I'm running for Robert's senate seat.
Robert's senate seat?
Uh-huh. - Does Robert know that?
Yeah, he's the one who suggested it. - Oh.
I... I know that it's a shocker,
but I just want to make sure that you guys are all on board.
okay. So don't everybody speak at once.
maybe, you know, we should take a vote. - No.
I mean, come on, like we used to, you know, vote on family vacations and whether or not Kevin was gay.
all right, so everybody who's in favor, raise your hands now, and then we'll get...
now wait a second. Wait a second.
as I remember, all those votes were anonymous. - Uh, subtle mom.
wait, so what, pen and paper? - Yeah.
let's go. - Yeah, in the second drawer right there.
brent Lewinskys... that is a name I have not heard in so many years.
Kevin, what did you ever see in him?
he was a very bad influence on you.
uh, mom, do the words "tall" and "drink of water" mean anything to you?
uncle Saul, you gonna tally?
Yes, yes, yes. I'm tallying. - Okay.
all right. Here we go.
okay, I got one, two, three, four, five, six.
okay, here we go. I got a "yes" - Thank you.
I got a "yes" - Thank you.
and a "yes..." - Thank you.
and a "yes..." - Thank you.
and a "yes..." - Thank you.
and a...
why are you all looking at me?
my attorneys promised me a rough of the contract end of day yesterday...
and you have a call into them.
you either aren't serious about selling your shares to me or you've got the worst representation in California.
Dennis, this takes time.
so... meet me tonight. We'll hammer out the details.
let your monkeys apply the legalese afterwards.
no, I... I can't meet you tonight.
no, of course you can't.
you know what?
maybe it's time I start looking at other options.
no, wait. Dennis, wait... - I'll tell you what...
if you're serious, meet me.
if not... It's been nice knowing you.
so I'm guessing this means our plans for today are off.
I'm sorry. I have to go to the office.
what?
this has gotta stop.
I'm sorry, David. But I have work to do.
work?
excuse me?
you don't have any money.
all you've got is your shares in Ojai, and this guy is giving you a great price for them.
Yes, which only confirms for me how much more they're worth.
York knows something about Ojai. I'm sure of it.
and I am so close to finding out what that is.
this isn't about money.
this is about William Walker and that company.
this is about you holding on to something that was never yours in the first place.
that was uncalled for.
I'm getting ready for work.
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
Simon Krantz should be Kitty's field officer.
okay. I guess we're skipping pleasantries this morning.
is that the list? - Uh, yeah. Campaign directors only.
Where's, uh, where's Kit?
she's... out there moping.
apparently there was, a, uh, primary in Pasadena last night.
Yeah, the... the post-it election.
Why? She's not hung up on that, is she?
well, she is wondering how she can be expected to win over the masses when she can't even get her own mother behind her.
technically, it was anonymous.
she's about to announce her run.
I need her in the zone, not obsessing about her mother.
okay, well, then maybe I should talk to her. - Good. I'll talk to Nora.
um, are... are you sure about that?
because that might actually make things worse. - I can handle your mother.
that's what Napoleon said on the way to Waterloo.
Oh, and, Kevin. - Yeah.
this list... - Mm-hmm.
I mean, obviously, your name is not on it, but you know Kitty wants you to be her campaign director.
no, I didn't know that.
well, she hasn't said it out loud, but... I mean, it's a no-brainer.
Kevin, you are the short list. - I do have a job, you know?
which is probably why she hasn't mentioned it.
she knows how much I value you.
if this is what's gonna be good for Kitty, - it's what we're gonna do. - Okay.
I didn't even know the mayor could cook.
well, I don't know if he can, but it really doesn't matter.
all he has to do is stand there and smile.
I'm the guest chef.
I will do all the cooking, and Scotty will supervise it.
that's how these events work.
sounds like a plan. - Yep.
Robert, you know, my children loiter around this kitchen all the time, and that's fine, but you're a senator.
go do something important.
I am doing something important.
you know what?
you're barking up the wrong tree.
that "no" vote was not mine. - Oh, come on, Nora.
I mean, the thought of Kitty becoming a G. O.P. senator makes you shudder.
so let's... let's... let's talk about it. - You know what?
if Kitty can't handle one "no" vote from a family member, - then god help the great state of California. - But it's not just one vote.
I mean, come on. It's... it's you guys.
and look, there are a hundred senators. - I know how many senators there are.
I am willing to bet you there's not one that doesn't have the entire support of their family.
well, then, you know what? I wish you lots of good luck about finding that culprit and getting them on board.
in the meantime, I'm busy. So please excuse me.
Oh, crap.
Oh, Scotty. Yeah, Scotty.
the mayor what? Oh, no. Denver?
they had to make an emergency landing. - Oh, god. Well, you know what?
just tell him to get on another flight.
bump someone. He's the mayor, after all.
I know. It's awful.
Oh, hold on a second. Hello? - Hey, Scotty. It's Robert.
Oh, hi, Robert. Um, you know, now's not really a good time...
Yeah, no. Hey. I hear you need a chef. - What are you doing?
Yeah. How'd you hear that? - Listen, I just want you to know that I am completely available, - and I could be there in an hour. - Put your hand over the phone.
Really? Oh, y. yeah. That'd be fantastic.
put your hand over the phone. - I mean, senator trumps mayor, right?
put your hand over the phone. - Oh! Why... why don't I put us all on speakerphone?
there you go, Scotty. You got us both. - Hi, Scotty.
Hi. Looks like we're back in business. - Yeah. Isn't that lucky for us?
l... listen, let's not waste time. Nora and I will get - our stuff together, and we will be there shortly. - We'll be there, soon.
all right. I'll see you then. Bye. Thanks.
Oh, come on, darling. Just a little bit.
Mmm. Num, num, num.
is any of that getting in his stomach?
Oh, well, it does eventually.
why don't you give him some of this orange stuff?
it's delicious. - Well, of course it's delicious. It's dessert.
and he has to have some of the green stuff first.
there you go. - Why don't you bribe him a little like mom used to do?
well, because I'm not mom. Am I, Evan?
no. See? I'm on your side.
that's right. I'm on your side. Yay!
and if you ever decide to run for senate,
I'm gonna vote for you, even if you run as a Green Party candidate.
it was just a stupid vote. - No, it wasn't a stupid vote, Kevin.
it was my mother's vote... my own mother.
Oh, dear.
I think you have had enough of this green stuff.
would you like to take a little break and go into your playpen? There you go.
okay. Let's get you out of here. - You're not gonna let this slow you down, are you?
cause right now, it seems Robert's a little more excited about this campaign than you are.
I'm not gonna lie to you. It bothers me.
you ready to go in your playpen? - Kit, you're gonna win this. I know you are.
and you're gonna be a great senator.
don't let one stupid little "no" vote put a damper on things.
this coming from a guy who can't even face his own high school reunion?
Oh, come on. Not that again, please.
well, Kevin, I don't understand what you're so afraid of.
Yeah, because you had an entirely different experience in high school.
of course you don't understand. - Oh, come on. It couldn't have been that bad.
I was fat. I had no friends. Worst four years of my life. - And look at you now.
you're a completely different person.
R... right. So why would I want to go back there? - Look, I'll tell you what...
I promise not to dwell on mom's "no" vote if you go to your high school reunion.
no, no. I wouldn't even have a date.
Scotty has this thing tonight, so... - Well, I'll go.
you'd do that? - Of course.
I think that you need to show the Brent Lewinskys of the world what you're really made of.
well, Brent's not gonna be there, which is why I'm only even considering doing this.
so we're going?
why do I have a feeling I'm gonna regret this?
well, um, in front of you you'll find the menus and the recipes. Um, we're gonna start with a watermelon and roasted beet salad, a lamb stew over polenta - and for dessert, a pumpkin bread pudding. - Mmm.
Scotty, I just want to say this. - Hmm?
are... are you really set on this regular feta?
a sharp feta is so much more flavorful.
and this cumin... you don't mind if I make a little tweak, - No. - Good, 'cause I was thinking of lessening it in favor of a little more coriander to make the flavor of the meat pop.
it's a trick the Israeli prime minister taught me at the U. N. Food Summit last year. - Ah.
okay. Well, I mean, those both sound doable, - So long as we otherwise stick to the menu I shopped for. - Yeah. Absolutely.
Absolutely. Absolutely. Okay, so... okay. - Great.
well, uh, you... you have everything you need. - Yeah.
so I'll, uh, let you get to it. - Here we go.
all right. Thanks. - Yeah.
okay, so why don't I get started on the meat?
whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. Wait a minute. That's the entree, - and my name's on it. - Well, all the more reason why I should probably cook it.
lamb can be very tricky.
why don't you put the water on for the polenta?
you... you want me to boil water?
didn't the Israel prime minister teach you how to do that? - You know what, guys?
um, I don't mean to interrupt here,
but, um, maybe you could share the lamb duties.
a lot goes into it. - Excellent. Great idea.
you know, he's really right about that.
it's so much better this way... you and I, together,
united front.
Wow. I thought they have checked your weapons at the door.
only a Republican would see these as weapons and not kitchen utensils.
you know, with our Kitty in the senate, - You wouldn't have to conceal those bad boys? - Oh, Robert, for god sake.
let's just stick to cooking tonight, all right? - I'm just saying.
just... cook.
I already feel a breakout coming on.
did you bring any zit cream? - Would you just relax?
no. No, no, no. I'm not wearing a name tag.
those are for geeks. - Nobody is gonna think you're a geek.
I think this was a mistake. - All right, listen,
you are a young, very handsome lawyer.
and you're soon to be a very young, hot father.
don't... don't say that. Okay? Really.
Scotty and I, we don't want to jinx it.
we won't know if the implantation... - Okay. Whatever, whatever.
has taken till Monday. No, I'm serious. - Shh. Okay, okay, okay.
Kitty Walker? Oh, my god.
what are you doing here? You're, like, famous.
Stacy Hodges.
my sister Amanda was in your class.
Oh.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
seriously, how come you're slumming it with us freshmen?
Oh, I, um...
I... I just wanted to be with my brother.
uh, yeah, for moral support.
no, I begged him to let me come because...
well... well... well, I... I just really like being with him because he's... he's, uh, he's so cool.
uh, Tommy, right?
Kevin. - Kevin. Right.
sorry. - Happens all the time.
Oh, hey. - Hey.
what are you doing here?
I thought you were going out with mom tonight?
Yeah, we were. She had to work. What's that?
um, just some files that she asked for.
wait. She's at Ojai? Why... why... why is she there?
uh, you'll have to ask her, Rebecca.
what's all this?
uh, a friend of mine is directing this movie in Belize.
he, uh, he asked me if I'd direct the second unit.
you know, I wasn't gonna do it, but... - You're going to Belize - Yeah. - For how long?
uh, probably a few months.
so mom's just okay with... this?
I doubt she'll notice.
I'm gonna, uh, stay with a friend of mine until we fly out on Monday.
I'll call her before we leave. - Wait, wait.
so you... you guys get into a fight, - and... you just take off? - You know what? I need a break.
I, uh, I just can't compete with Ojai anymore.
you know, maybe when I get back, we'll...
you know, business is really bad right now.
I mean, so she's working a Saturday night?
she's the co-president... - No, no, no, no, no. It's more complicated than that.
you can't leave her right now. She needs you more than ever.
she's fighting for something that she really believes in.
why can't you understand that?
good night. - Good night.
are you okay with this...
whole going slow thing?
Yeah. I think slow is... is good. - Good.
I slept with my husband before I knew his last name.
I got stuck with it for ten years.
so that didn't work out too well for me.
I probably shouldn't have told you that.
for me, it's, uh, my kids mostly.
Oh. - I... I just...
the divorce really shook'em up, and I... I just...
I'm not sure they're ready to see me with somebody new... - No.
and I... - I know exactly what you mean. Had the same thing with my kids.
yeah? I just... I don't think it's fair - to bring someone into my life until I know that it's real. - Real.
right. I mean, it's grown-up.
Yeah, yeah.
okay, then.
should we... should we be doing this?
um, yeah, but, uh, maybe we should get a motel.
won't that make us feel cheap? - Yeah.
come on. Let's go before the sitter sees me.
thank you.
club soda.
having fun yet?
I will let you know if the third drink kicks...
brent Lewinsky?
don't sound so enthusiastic.
no. I, um, I... I'm sorry.
I didn't think you were gonna be here tonight.
don't worry. I'm not gonna make you put a cherry bomb - in fishman's tailpipe or anything. - Yeah, my... my ears are still ringing.
I just saw your sister. - You... you did?
Yeah, the old girl with the debate team. - Uh, did... did you talk to her?
no. - Okay, here's the thing... um...
you and me, we did a lot of crazy things back then.
Yeah, but what we did to your sister...
Yeah. Um... I never told her.
okay? And I really need it to stay that way. - Sure, man?
I did a lot of crazy things back then, you know? - Mm... hmm.
I'm five years sober now, so my days of acting like a complete idiot are over.
Yeah. Well... well, you sure could drink.
I remember that.
Ugh. High school was a blur.
in fact, I almost didn't come tonight.
Yeah, I... I saw you R. S.V. P.'D "no
there's triggers everywhere.
Oh, right.
my sponsor says that I'll be all right, so...
Yeah.
how about you? You got any good memories?
what, of high school? No, it was pretty traumatizing.
not... not in a "hazing, homoerotic, crawl around on the locker room floor and squeal like a pig" type of way... I wish.
just more, um, "sitting alone on the bleachers with my alto sax and leg warmers, longing.
I'm gay, by the way. - I got that.
right. - So what were you longing for?
I don't know. Just be a part of things, I guess.
you were a part of things. You were part of everything.
I swear, if there's a yearbook floating around here, - you'd be in every picture. - Yeah, I... I did edit the yearbook.
you were gonna to be most likely to succeed from day one.
well, did you? - What?
succeed.
uh, well, I'm... I'm a lawyer.
I'm not practicing, but that's only because I'm working for senator Mccallister.
no kidding?
Yeah. And I'm married... to, uh, to a man.
I believe we already established that.
Yeah. - Any kids?
not yet.
Oh, man, you gotta do it.
I got three.
my biggest accomplishment.
I've made money you know, but next to fatherhood...
that's, uh... everything else just kind of seems silly.
very cute. Actually, we are gonna have a kid.
no way. When?
uh, well, we have a surrogate, and we just got her pregnant.
Oh, man. You did succeed.
thank you. We're very excited.
Hey, guys.
do you remember Kevin Walker?
he's having a baby!
apps are a hit, you guys. Can't wait to taste that stew.
just making a few improvements.
too much coriander.
Mm. You're right. My bad.
Oh, but it's gonna be great.
great. I'm sure it will be.
your polenta needs stirring.
no, I'd rather not.
it makes it a little gluey. - Well, if you would've used some of the low-sodium chicken broth I suggested, it wouldn't be a problem and it would be healthier.
speaking of health, did Kitty tell you that all her doctors were unanimous, that she's up to the rigors of the campaign?
well, I'm glad to hear it.
cumin, please. - So you are excited.
I'm excited, Robert. I'm excited. I'm thrilled.
hmm. Mm.
Robert, let me ask you a question.
why is it so important that you install my daughter in your senate seat?
install? You think that I'm pulling the strings?
it was your idea, wasn't it? - Well, yeah, when I saw that Kitty was aiming so low with the California 54th.
I mean, she's so much better than that.
Nora, I think Kitty is capable of great things.
you know who you sound like?
her father.
you're always pushing her to be something you think she should be.
that's where you and I differ, Robert.
you see, I love Kitty for just exactly who she is.
mom.
Rebecca, hey.
what are you doing here? It's saturday night.
there's not enough hours in the week, right?
you really don't know what's going on. - What's wrong?
dad's leaving. - What are you talking about?
he took a movie in Belize.
he's... he's gonna be gone for three months. - No, wait, wait. Hold on.
he turned down that job days ago.
mom, I was just at your house, and he was packing.
he said he's gonna stay with a friend until he leaves on Monday.
right. Of course.
so what? You... you guys had a fight...
Yes, we did.
and now your father is doing what he does best... taking off.
but... Mom... - "but, mom" what?
hmm? What am I supposed to do?
I don't know. Maybe stop him? - It wouldn't do any good.
mom, you're not gonna solve Ojai's problems overnight.
and you're certainly not gonna do it by yourself.
Rebecca, I asked your father for a little time.
but obviously, he doesn't have the patience or he doesn't have any faith in what I am trying to do here.
I can't change that.
I'm... I'm sorry, but I have a lot of work to do.
there you are.
I've been looking all over for you.
Yeah, look, uh, Kitty's here now.
you gonna be okay? You sure?
okay, I love you, too. Bye.
what happened?
the implantation didn't take.
Michelle had a period.
Oh, crap. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Kevin.
it's not the end of the world. We have more eggs. I...
Hey, Kevin! Kevin!
lewinsky told us you're doing the whole surrogacy thing.
is that true?
Yeah.
well, so did Marvin Kruger. Remember him?
Hi. - He's gay, too.
my partner and I had our twins about five years ago.
best thing that ever happened to us.
I'm so happy for you guys. - Thank you.
Yay! - Yay.
this is gonna be a hell of a fight. It's gonna be brutal.
and that's why she needs all of you guys behind her.
I'm not listening to this right now.
no, but you need to. Her opponents will come at her.
they will rip her to pieces. - I know that.
then call her. Tell her you support her.
how can you let her go into this fight not fully armed?
because I don't want her in this fight in the first place.
there. I said it. Are you happy now?
I don't want her to run.
I wish I felt differently, but I don't.
Hey, guys.
they're calling for you.
we gotta go take a bow.
Yeah.
and here they are.
you sure you're happy to leave? - Oh, my God. Are you kidding?
I only came here for you. Let's get out of here.
whoa, whoa, whoa. Where the hell do you think you're going?
um, you know what, Brent? I'm not feeling so good.
so we're gonna duck out early. - Come on, man! Don't be such a wuss.
I... I had a blast. - Do I have to kick your ass?
I'm sorry. Did you not hear what he said?
he said that he didn't feel good. - Kit.
didn't realize your sister was so feisty, Walker?
y... - Feisty? Wh... do I know you?
no, you don't. We're gonna go. - Brent Lewinsky.
my brother Steve beat you for class president.
did you tell her yet, Walker, what we did?
you know, I... I thought you were on the wagon, Brent?
Oh, come on, man! It's hilarious.
no, no. What... what did you do? What did you do? What?
tell me what? What? - We rigged the election...
me and your bro here.
that's why you lost.
I hoisted him up through Principal Raker's window, and we switched all of your votes for votes for my brother.
you should have seen Kevin.
I... I... I thought he was gonna piss his pants.
he was so scared.
I'm so sorry, Kit.
Oh, come on! Don't be such a fag.
we were, like, 14.
do you think this is funny?
and making yourself feel good.
while making everybody else feel bad...
I mean, is that funny to you?
because all my brother ever wanted was for you to like him.
Kitty, please...
and he thought that your little gang was cool for some stupid reason, and he just wanted to be a part of it.
but you know what you did? You made him grovel.
you made him sell his sister down the river, but even that wasn't good enough for you, was it?
you know... you know what I think you should do?
I think you should take a look around and see what's really going on here, because this is not funny.
and you know what else I think you should do?
I think you should go to a meeting, and I think you should make amends, because clearly, you have a lot to be sorry for. Come on, Kevin.
Oh, oh, I, um, I have one more thing to say to you.
you ever again call my brother a fag,
I will have you killed.
let's go. Let's just go.
I'm such a loser.
Oh, come on. It was 20 years ago.
I know, and I'm still doing it.
you should've seen me in there, shooting my mouth off about being a father.
it's, like, f... for what, so I can feel like I'm... straight?
so what? So what if you...
if you spoke prematurely about being a father?
I mean, it doesn't make you any less of a success story.
Oh, yeah, I'm so much of a success story,
I had to have my big sister protect me just now.
well, that's what big sisters are for.
you were pretty impressive.
Ah, no, I wasn't.
Yeah, you were.
Ah, well. You know where I get it from, don't you?
Mr. Gandervort's karate class?
no. I get it from mom.
Ugh. It's true. It's true.
and you know that "no" vote? That was just mom being tough.
and, you know, you have it, too, even if you don't know it.
and with you running my campaign this fall,
I... I swear to you,
we are going to be an impossible ticket to beat.
Oh, God.
what... what's wrong?
Oh, God. All right.
before you go hiring me, I have to tell you something.
Mm-hmm.
it was me, Kit.
the "no" vote wasn't mom.
Wow. Wow.
you... You really are full of surprises tonight, aren't you?
I'm... Kit, I am so sorry.
it's just... you know, when I first heard
robert wasn't running for reelection, - I got so, so excited. - Excited about what?
well, I...
I don't know.
being free, I guess.
it's j... you know what?
all my life, I've been trying to prove myself.
look, why else did a gay Democrat go and work for a Republican senator?
if... if I wasn't trying to prove myself, right?
Kevin, you don't have to explain it to me.
I'm a big girl, and I can totally take it. - No, you're my sister.
if you wanted me to run your campaign, there's no way I could've said no to you.
I'm only just realizing it now for the first time.
I, you know, I voted "no" because I...
I didn't want to have to vote "yes" to more of this, you know, politics.
Mm-hmm.
kit, I am so sorry.
first of all, you have to stop saying you're sorry.
sorry. - I mean, this is your life, and you are allowed... to vote "no."
and if you don't want to be my campaign manager, well, ... I'll find somebody else.
it'll be no big deal.
I mean, they won't be as... as cute as you, but...
that's a given.
Yeah.
do you remember in high school when we used to go home on Saturday nights or...
mom's hot fudge sundaes?
Mm-hmm. Come on.
Nora.
no, Robert. No, no, no.
the fight is over.
look, look. I'm putting my weapons away.
it was Kevin.
Yeah. I just got off the phone with Kitty.
Kevin?
Yeah, apparently, it's part of a larger story.
but, um...
I'm sorry.
it was Kevin.
that's a surprise.
look, Robert, I voted "yes,
but in my heart, I voted "no.
you're right. She is going to need us.
and it's not about my politics or hers.
but I am so frightened for her.
it's so ugly and brutal.
I watched what they did to you.
nothing was off-limits.
it didn't matter whether it was true or false.
and they're gonna do the same thing to Kitty, and I am so frightened for her.
well... She said she wants the fight.
and she's tough.
I know.
I want to call her and talk to her.
Oh, I... I don't think you have to.
she and Kevin are on their way to your house. - Why?
I don't know. Something about making ice cream sundaes.
Oh, no, they don't. I make the sundaes.
I make the ice cream sundaes.
I make the ice cream sundaes.
thanks for the beer.
who knew a low-rent rendezvous could be so great?
Low-rent? Are you kidding me?
there's an air conditioner.
there... there are movies on demand, magic fingers...
not necessarily in that order.
my fingers are pretty magic, aren't they?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, my God. They have "Spinal Tap."
Oh, Spinal what?
tap. You know...
this dial goes up to 11.
uh... No. I... I'm sorry. - Rob Reiner, Christopher guest.
you know... The amp goes up to 11.
11? I don't get it. Why wouldn't 10 be the highest, uh...
because that's the joke.
okay. - This movie, it's... it's like religion in my family.
I guess I just don't find British humor that amusing.
no, they're not. They're not British.
they're not even British.
okay.
is everything okay?
uh, yeah.
Yeah, it's just the sitter.
wants to know when I'll be home.
I'm glad you're here, Holly.
this is not how I like to do business...
being summoned to a hotel room.
so why don't you cut to the chase?
all right.
I think you're stalling.
I think you have no intent to sell me those shares.
why would I be stalling?
because...
you think I know something about this company that you don't.
well, the thought did cross my mind.
so what if you're right?
what if there's a boatload of money out there...
millions of dollars...
just waiting to be spent?
and what if I think I can't get to it without you?
I'm listening.
how about a deal, Holly?
a partnership... you and me?
we go in on this together, and I swear, we will make you a very wealthy woman.
intriguing.
how about I call down to room service, get us some drinks?
a martini for you?
well, before you do that, why don't you tell me about this boatload?
well, uh...
I'd like to relax first.
what do you mean, relax?
I want the same deal that William got.
you know...
clearly, you were very... loyal to him.
if I'm gonna speak all my secrets to you,
I'd like that same loyalty.
now...
Hi. - Hi.
I hear there's gonna be sundaes.
I hope you brought more ice cream. - Uh, yeah, yeah, I did.
um... Look, Mom, I'm so sorry.
no. - No, I... I never should've doubted you.
no, Kitty, look, I didn't instantly...
and of course it wasn't you, and I...
someother you with support, which is what you expected.
you had every reason to doubt me.
and plus, you spent the whole night in the kitchen with my husband, which is...
are you kidding? That was fabulous.
no. - I wish you could hear how he talks about you.
Oh! Oh, my God.
what? - Look what I found.
what are they?
flags.
just like the flags I'm gonna be waving for you at every campaign stop, from here to Eureka.
mom, does this mean you're changing Parties?
I heard there was ice cream. - Um, what kind of sundae do you want?
don't tell me. Caramel with sprinkles. Thank you.
okay, tell me. How was the big date?
mission accomplished.
in a motel.
a motel? - Mm-hmm.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I am so jealous. - Sorry, Mom.
Oh, please. My god.
it was the women of my generation...
Betty Friedan, Erica Jong... who coined the phrase "G-spot.
okay, that's disturbing.
motel sex is fabulous.
your father and I used to stop off... - Oh!
Oh, Mom, gross. - Ew, ew, ew.
fine, fine, fine. - No, no.
I hope you had a very pleasant evening.
Yeah. Did you see, like, fireworks and stars and stripes and everything?
that must be what happens when Republicans orgasm.
Saul. I didn't call Saul.
Oh! Okay.
she's very funny tonight.
details.
Oh! It was fine.
fine good? Fine bad?
good. Fine good. - Good.
good. The evening was a little weird.
he hasn't seen "Spinal Tap." - You're kidding me?
Mnh-mnh. - "Spinal Tap"?
Mm-hmm. - Really?
if we need an extra push over the cliff... - You know what we do?
we put it up to 11. - We put it up to 11.
okay, so it wasn't an 11 then, but...
no, it was... It was a 7. 7. 5.
Oh, well, 7. 5 is... is very good.
Yeah.
I got this text...
from Luc.
but I've been down that path. It didn't work out.
I can't compare Roy to a fantasy.
Yeah. You know what? 7. 5 is... is pretty darn good.
you can build on it.
you sure can. Improvement.
Holly?
I... I thought you had left.
well...
I forgot something.
Really? What did you forget?
you.
what?
I've asked over and over again for you to let go.
and I realized...
that I've never given you any reason to believe that I would be here if you did.
marry me.
are you serious?
cause after the night that I've had...
I'm serious.
Yes.
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
and... and I will let go.
I am going to sell my shares.
I'm gonna get out of Ojai. I mean it.
okay? - Okay.
it might help.
you are all right?
you okay?
Mm-hmm.
I love you.
I love you, too.
I can't stop eating these things. They're so good.
Oh, hey, love birds. Come on.
you're melting the ice cream out here.
could we just please start this thing already?
what are we starting? - What are you so grumpy about?
we're having a revote. - A revote?
okay, the election results are invalidated.
so we're gonna do it again and leave it at that. - Yes.
okay, come on. Let's get it over with. - I'll get a paper and pen.
No! No, no. No paper and pen.
this is not gonna be an anonymous vote, all right?
we're gonna have it all out in the open.
I'm not gonna be falsely accused again. - Okay.
fine. Kitty, you have the floor.
okay, uh, all those in favor of me running... - Aye!
of me running for Robert's senate seat, say... - Aye.
Aye!
so he has no excuse not to sleep through the night.
Oh, thank God. I am so tired, and I have so much work to do tomorrrow.
well, maybe we should really be thinking about doing something else.
honey, I'm sorry, but the press is expecting me to announce my candidacy on the steps of city hall next week.
have I told you how much I love your lips?
you and 77% of California.
Really? - Yep.
my pre-announcement polls came in, and everybody agrees that my lips are my greatest asset.
everybody loves my mouth.
Yeah. What do they think about this spot?
uh, well, which spot?
this one.
Oh, well, I don't think they did a poll on that spot.
mm, if they did, you'd win a landslide.
ignore it.
Oh, no, I can't.
Ugh. It's Buffy. That woman has been calling me all day.
you cannot hire her to be your campaign manager.
ll, honey, I have to at least give her a meeting.
I mean, she is my friend.
I don't care. Just tell her she's not getting the job.
I need that phone to stop ringing.
she's the best political strategist out there.
no, you're the best. - Well, yes, but I can't hire myself, can I?
well, you'll figure something out.
Mm. That... that would be you.
is this her number?
she is relentless.
Hello, Buffy.
Yes, you are disturbing me, but go ahead.
okay, I'll talk to her.
tomorrow. I'll do it. Okay. Bye bye.
all right, you have brunch with her tomorrow and just put her out of her misery.
no. I'm going to give her a proper interview, and if she doesn't work out, then you and I are gonna hit the lists again on Sunday.
Sunday is, uh, Valentine's day, and our sex-iversary - Oh, that... that's not a real thing. - It is, too.
Oh, honey. Every day a holiday with you.
so every painting is $500?
Yeah, but they're anonymous.
that way, the only reason to buy it is because you like it.
Rebecca loves this one... But $500... you know, I can't afford that.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I'm getting Kevin boxers for Valentine's day.
I was gonna go underwear, too, but she's pregnant.
you know, it seems a little inappropriate. - Oh. Sure.
but I... I don't know what to do. I'm totally out of ideas.
wait. Are you asking me what to get a woman for Valentine's day?
because the last Valentine I gave to a woman was written in crayon, and there were boxes for "yes" and "no.
things were so much easier back then.
he's your boyfriend.
you have to get him something for Valentine's day.
no, we've never actually used that word.
you know, we haven't been seeing each other that long.
you're having sex, so he's either your boyfriend or a friend with benefits.
Oh, God. I'm sorry, Kevin. There's gotta be something in between.
maybe, but that was definitely a boyfriend wave.
I don't get it. Two weeks ago he was Mr. Perfect.
no, I like Roy.
you know I don't like Valentine's day. It's too much pressure, and I don't see why I should have to define my relationship so that some greeting card company can make money.
I mean, it's the opposite of romantic if you think about it.
Yeah, it's not like meeting a beautiful man in the south of France.
stop it.
didn't he... - No, I never texted back.
I'm sorry. Has it ever occurred to you, you might still be in love with Luc?
Kevin, I was never in love with Luc. I was enthralled. There is a difference.
secondly, it didn't work out.
it was impractical, and I am trying to be a grown-up.
right. So ask Roy to be your Valentine.
it's no big deal. Even Paige has a Valentine this year.
I'm sorry? - Oh, you didn't...
no, I didn't. - Oh, well, me and Paige are tight.
Oh, Justin. - Hey.
so I think I have this great idea for Sarah's Valentine gift.
Oh, what is it?
roller skating.
no good?
no. She actually broke her ankle roller skating when she was 12.
I think she still suffers from PTSD.
okay. Uh, I just thought it would be retro and hilarious, romantic in that,
Olivia Newton-John in "Xanadu" kind of way. I totally get it.
okay. Well, l... let's think about it. What else could you get her?
I don't know. We're both kind of practical people with kids, which is why I thought about doing something rather than a gift.
we could spend some time alone.
Yeah, you've really thought about this. That's so nice.
Yeah.
it's so beautiful. Look at it... the color, the light.
it's making me want to touch it.
don't. Here comes the gallery owner.
it's a great piece, isn't it? - Oh, yeah. It's so lovely.
I know the paintings are supposed to be anonymous, but the artist of this particular piece happens to be here.
I could arrange an introduction if you'd like. - Oh, I'd love that.
all right. I'll see if I can find him. - Thank you.
Why?
there's a woman out front who wants to meet you.
come here.
there.
that's...that's okay.
just... just tell her I'm not here.
you really like it? - I love it.
there's something about the way the forms are so constrained and then this blue line in the middle just flies off the canvas like...
like it just wants to keep going forever or you know...
what do you think?
honestly, I think it looks like something Libby did in second grade.
I'm sorry. He wasn't here after all.
Oh. Would you just tell him I loved it?
I will.
Hey, what's going on? Why are you still awake?
there's something I need to tell you.
okay.
the other night, when you proposed,
I had just come back from a meeting with York.
yeah? - Well, he said that I was right about the hidden value of the company. There definitely is one.
what is it?
I still don't know.
that's what I'm trying to tell you. - Oh, Holly. Come on.
no, no, no. David...
York tried to blackmail me.
I was in his hotel room, and he started coming on to me.
and he said that he would tell me the secret and even make me a partner if I slept with him.
but I... I... I... I... I didn't.
you know, I... I wouldn't... - I believe you, Holly. I believe you.
you... you do? - Of course I do.
all right, what are you gonna do? You want me to deal with York?
no. I just want him out of my life.
all right, so when does the deal go through?
this afternoon.
my bank said that they would call me when his funds landed.
but York has this major grudge against the Walkers, and when they find out who I sold my shares to...
well, that's not your problem, Holly. - Yeah, but what about Rebecca, huh?
I mean, she lands right in the middle again.
then you have to talk to Rebecca before the bank calls.
but don't get sentimental about the Walkers.
they're certainly not sentimental about you.
no, I know that's true.
look, um,
I'm supposed to get on this plane in a couple of hours.
you want me to cancel the trip and stay? - Oh, no, no. Go.
I know what I have to do.
okay.
I think it's in this book. It's not in that one.
here it is... the 《Brownie Recipe》.
Yeah, look how old it is. But I made a copy. That one you can keep.
wait, wait, wait. You make these from scratch?
I thought it was a mix, that you just added some things into it.
a mix?
you can't make Justin's favorite brownies from a mix. No, no, no.
did you always know how to bake or did you learn when you had a family?
I was raised in the '50s.
all the girls， we learned how to bake. We had home economics.
well, I didn't have home economics, so you're gonna have to talk me through this.
Yes, I absolutely will.
you know, I have this fabulous tin in my office, this little red tin.
it's perfect, because presentation is really half of it.
Oh, my God. Oh. Nora?
Oh, God, something's wrong.
Rebecca, what? - I don't know. Something's happening.
okay, just sit still. I'll call 911. - Okay.
Oh, God.
do you want to try to drink a little more of this?
no, thank you. I'm not thirsty.
well, they really want you to drink as much as you can.
I'm really not thirsty. - Okay.
can we go yet?
well, the doctor wants to keep his eye on you, just for a little while.
I don't want to be here.
I know.
I know.
I remember when I was on my second or third date with William, and I didn't really know him very well, but he took me to this seafood restaurant where I got massive food poisoning.
thought I was gonna die. Ended up in the Emergency Room.
I was reading "Valley of the dolls" at that time, and I had a copy in my purse.
he stayed with me there all night, read to me.
every 30 seconds I stuck my head in a bucket and puked my guts out.
Yeah, I wouldn't return his call for weeks. - Why?
I was mortified. I didn't want him to see me like that.
and now, not only was I the girl with her head in the bucket, but he found out I was reading "Valley of the dolls.
but the... the truth of the matter is, he liked taking cared of me, and I liked that he liked it.
okay. I'll have a sip of water.
good.
you want to talk about it?
no. - Okay.
but thank you for... for being there and calling my mom and Justin.
can you not tell anybody until Justin gets here?
I won't tell anyone. - I came as fast as I could. You okay?
I lost the baby.
Oh, sweetie. I'm sorry.
listen, I'm gonna wait outside, give you guys some time.
thank you.
Oh, sweetheart.
well, obviously we need to review... thank you... my platform.
platforms are for olympic divers. We need to already be swimming.
Hey, can I just cut to the chase and let's eighty-six this little audition?
no. I'm sorry, Buffy, but this is an interview, and frankly, it's not going very well.
come on. I already have the job.
I'm pretty sure that's up to me. - Well, you waited too long.
what do you mean, I waited too long?
sweetheart, you think you're announcin' from city hall?
I am. - No.
the governor's comin' in to meet with the mayor. Budget crisis
that building is gonna be swarming with SUVs three-deep, loaded with security.
a staffer will probably be calling you in the next half-hour.
how did you know that?
I am obsessed with these things. I have sources everywhere.
anyway, you can do better.
you have the perfect spot. It's just hiding in plain sight.
what are you talking about?
Hony, your choice of venue is really a decision best left to your campaign manager.
Oh, come on, Buffy. You know what? Blackmail is not a good color on you.
well, just tell me I have the job. - Prove to me you deserve it.
you're a moderate Republican running on family values and small business.
Ojai Foods. - Bingo
I was already thinking about it, and, they can't say no, because they're my family.
standard vetting will need to be done. - Of course.
but I think most of the skeletons in that particular closet have already been found.
speaking of skeletons, is there anything you need to tell me?
no. No, you can start digging.
okay. Well, your hair is growing in beautifully.
thank you.
Yes. And you feel comfortable releasing your medical records?
I do. I feel good. I'm... I'm in remission.
good. Okay. Nothin' else I need to know? - Nothing else you need to know.
so do I deserve it? - No. But clearly, you have the job anyway.
did you know they have bacon chocolate here?
Oh, yeah. It's not just for breakfast anymore.
would you like to try anything else?
uh, I don't know. Kevin, do I want to try anything else?
Oh, yeah. Definitely do the wasabi next.
no. I draw the line at horseradish.
okay. Uh, how about the lavender? Scotty always wants to try that.
if Scotty wants to try the lavender, you can tell Scotty to come down here and taste it himself.
Ouch. Snark much recently? - Sorry. God, I just...
I don't know why you sent me to this place.
I just... I don't really need fancy, artisanal chocolate.
look, you have all day to figure this out, okay? I'm at work. I should go.
Oh! The... the chili pepper. That's meant to be an aphrodisiac.
get him that. - Okay.
but what if... he doesn't get me anything and I show up with... with a box of chili pepper or lavender or lox-infused chocolate?
they don't do lox. And he's gonna get you something.
hold on. Yeah? What's his name?
all right. Let him up, I guess. I have to go.
wait. I don't know what to get. - Be adventurous. Take a risk. bye
you know, nothing says "I love you" like sweethearts.
there's someone here to see you. He thinks it's important.
it's a Saturday. Who is it?
his name's Alec Tyler, says he knows you.
send him in. - Sure.
you can come in.
uh, Kevin, I think we're gonna need tospeak privately.
sure.
I'm probably the last person you expected or wanted to see.
Mm. Actually, I don't consider you at all.
I just need a minute of your time.
why should I talk to you?
you tried to steal my wife last year.
because I've been approached about my relationship with Kitty.
Oh. Okay, come on, Paigey. We're running late.
mom, have you seen my goggles? - I got 'em.
Thanks.
what?
Paige, do you have a Valentine? - You talked to uncle Kevin.
Mm-hmm. - It's nothing, really. Just...
there was a lot of hurt feelings last year, so Mrs. Nowicki wanted to be fair, and she put all of the boys' names into a hat and had the girls choose one.
Oh. Well, that's a nice way to do it.
we're also learning about India for social studies, so she thought it'd be a good lesson in arranged marriages.
do you like who you got?
he's okay.
just okay? - Well, there's this other boy.
Oh. There always is, honey. - Jake Gannon.
Oh. Sometimes when the teacher's talking and writing on the board, he'll go like this...
he's really funny and so cute.
but if I'd gotten Jake? Nightmare. - Why?
because I like him, and my cheeks probably would have turned pink, and I might have even barfed.
and he'd probably throw my Valentine's in the trash.
at least Andrew will say thank you.
well, there's a lot to be said for a boy who says thank you.
and as you grow up, Paige, you will realize that the man who makes you barf and blush...
that's not Mr. Perfect.
no.
no, there's a lot to be said for a nice thank you.
Hey.
the doctor's looking at her.
she'll be okay. - Oh, yeah. She'll be fine.
I'm not sure it's hit her yet, but...
no.
Holly, can I get you something? A cup of coffee maybe?
Oh, please, Nora. No, you've done enough already.
you were there when she needed you. That's what really matters.
I love Rebecca.
Nora, I, um...
you know, our life... you and I...
it's never been easy. It'll probably never be easy.
I may not have the chance to say this again.
I wanted to thank you, sincerely, for today.
I... it... it was nothing. We're family.
boy, I never thought I'd say that, but we are family now, you and I.
and that's what families do. We support each other.
I don't know what to say.
well, don't say anything. Here he is.
where is she? - Hi. It's room 243. Down the hall - Okay. You guys okay? - Yeah. We're fine. Go... go talk to her.
okay. Holly, at... at least let me call Sarah for you and... and tell her that you and Rebecca won't be in to work on Monday.
what?
well, the last thing you want to think about now is Ojai Foods.
no, that's me. That's me.
Oh, it's Kevin.
I'm gonna talk to him. - Sure.
Hi, honey. I'm glad you called.
so you're telling me that someone left you a voice mail.
Yes. They said that they wanted to talk about my relationship with Kitty.
and you didn't return the call? - No.
you know what? I don't believe you.
okay, listen. I want you to tell me what you want.
is this about the press? Are you writing a tell-all?
or is this just about the money?
I don't want money.
I am here for one reason to warn you.
you're a senator. I figure whoever is behind this is trying to sabotage your political career.
why would you give a damn about my career?
I don't, but Kitty does.
you know that Kitty is gonna be running for my seat?
she's about to announce.
Wow. Good for her.
it's a little early for a smear campaign, so whoever is behind this is a ahead of the curve.
who would have it out for Kitty?
I don't know yet. Here's what I want you to do.
I want you to call them and set up a meeting. Give them 24 hours.
you and I are gonna get to the bottom of this. - Okay.
Hey.
did you sleep with my wife?
no.
call me when you hear from them.
okay.
so I've ordered six dedicated phone lines.
they will be set up on Monday. - Only six?
until we find you a proper office, this is campaign central, - and your kitchen phone ain't cuttin' it. - Okay. What's this?
these are resumes of staffers, foot soldiers, speechwriters...
Oh, wait, wait, wait. Short list. I have a short list.
here it is. Right here in the blue folder.
okay. I'll take a look at that as soon as I'm done with my Ojai Foods research.
did you know that your father's company has employed over 3000 people since it opened?
did you find any red flags?
just another financially-strapped small business.
it's perfect.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, you are so cynical.
well, you need to get used to that.
as a matter of fact, we need to talk about who's gonna be onstage for the announcement.
well, that would be my family.
I have done a background check on Scotty Wandell, and apparently he's had some citations for vagrancy, something about sleeping in his car.
Yes, and he's also my brother's husband.
isn't that the point you're actually trying to make?
well, I'm not sayin' we have to keep him in the closet during the whole campaign.
I'm just saying we don't need to trot him out during the announcement.
he can be in the audience. - How do you sleep at night?
like a baby.
now let's talk about your husband.
what, you want to put him in the closet, too?
no. I want him to stand way in the back.
he can hold your beautiful baby.
you're gonna put my baby in the back?
okay, your mama can hold the baby.
I'm just saying, I don't want any distractions from the main event, which is you.
let's put your sister up there. We can put your war vet brother up there - or your kindly uncle Saul. - Uh, no. Saul is gay.
Oh, shoot. I should have known it when I saw his socks.
you know, here's the thing...
the reason that we're doing it at Ojai is because it's a family business.
Yes. That's the beauty of Ojai.
it's symbolic of family.
Hey, Sarah. You'll be very happy to know that you made the cut.
well, no. I mean that you get to stand onstage with me during my announcement.
Oh, no.
Oh, no. You're kidding me.
Oh, God. Poor Rebecca.
is she okay?
wait. No, no. Of course. Of course.
I will be there as soon as I can. Yeah.
uh, Buffy, I'm really sorry, but I have to go.
okay, Evan is Fed.
Evan is with the nanny. I'll... just...
Oh, wait a second. I need to ask you something.
no, sorry. I don't have time to answer any more questions.
who is Holly Harper?
no, I am not gonna vet another person in my life.
I'm sorry. I don't have time. - Listen. According to this,
Holly Harper has sold all her shares of Ojai Foods.
so you need to call your sister and find out who owns this company before you announce from there.
what are you thinking?
nothing.
I just feel empty.
well, the doctor said you're gonna be okay.
okay"?
what, like, "try again"?
Yeah. You know, when we're ready.
we weren't ready this time.
look, Rebecca, we... we don't have to talk about that.
all right? As long as we have each other, I'm happy.
could we just turn on theTV?
look, Rebecca, you have to let me in.
okay, cry, punch a wall, punch me, something...
but just let me help you.
I just want to go home.
I want to forget this ever happened.
okay.
nothing Holly does surprises me.
is she in there with Rebecca?
no, no, she left pretty much as soon as I got here.
she said it was important.
more important than her daughter, I guess.
Kevin, don't say that. All right? She's Rebecca's mother.
okay, okay, okay. Stop. You don't have to worry about it right now.
it's just so hard to watch her suffer.
I feel like there's nothing I can do.
Yeah.
Yeah, you know, I remember when it happened to me.
it... I didn't even know what to think.
and... and everybody wanted to talk about it, and it just...
it just seems impossible.
you know, I was at the bookstore at school today, and...
I noticed they had a kids' section.
my fuzzy Valentine.
I was gonna give it to her for Valentine's day, but...
you know, you should, uh, you should just give it to Evan.
he'll think it's cool, right?
Oh, Justin.
I'm sorry.
you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna keep this until you want it back.
it's okay.
it's okay. I'm sorry.
I've brought everybody up to speed.
I don't know what else to do. - I was just with her.
we sat there together with our children down the hall.
she looked me in the face and she never said anything.
Kitty just faxed over what she found. Take a look.
okay, please tell me Holly did not sell all her shares.
she sold all her shares.
even if she did, we have the majority.
no, this obstfeld capital group is obviously confident of gaining a majority share or they wouldn't have made her the offer.
she sold it to a conglomerate, behind our back, in the middle of the night?
how could she do this?
because Holly has no pride of ownership, that's how.
I wish dad had figured that out before he screwed her and left...
come on, Sarah. Stop dredging up the past. It's enough...
I am sick of cleaning up dad's messes.
I can't believe this is still going on.
no matter what your father might have done, it doesn't matter. It's not his company anymore.
it's ours, most especially yours and Saul's.
you've poured your heart into it.
everything of value here exists because of you.
and I swear to God, I'll see the whole place blown up before I see some faceless conglomerate take it over.
right. And I'm not ready to give up either, so...
how do you suggest we stop it?
with a big brick wall called the Walker family.
I'll call Holly, see if I can find out who this obstfeld group is.
no. I want to talk to Holly.
so...
how is she?
the... cancer.
I... I... I heard about it on tv.
she is better and better every day.
I'm glad to hear it.
I lost my wife to breast cancer.
how far along was she when you found out?
stage III.
um, and, you know, we... we tried everything, but, uh, it had spread too far.
I'm sorry.
you know, Kitty and I were not in a good place, even before she started taking Evan to the park.
I'd had a heart attack.
I... withdrew.
I shut her out, and so...
because of that, we've had to fight for everything that we have, and today we're better off than we've ever been, so...
I guess I should thank you.
what should I do?
answer it. Okay.
hello.
is there a place where we could sit down and maybe have a...
well, this is awkward, isn't it? - That's putting it mildly.
you two know each other?
I'm afraid we do. Alec, this is Buffy,
Kitty's college chum turned campaign manager.
Buffy, this is Alec, the man who did not have an affair with my wife.
Alec, thank you for coming forward. You're a stand-up guy.
Hey, I was investigating a potential problem.
an affair in the Republican party is a killer.
this was just a very sensitive issue.
I was being thorough.
you weren't being thorough. You were being disrespectful.
excuse me.
Oh, my God.
Roy, I...
I can't believe you got this for me.
well, I had this whole roller skating plan.
roller skating?
Yeah, but then I talked to your brother.
he, uh, he told me about the accident.
anyway, I wanted to do something better, and so I went back to the gallery.
Roy, it... it's so extravagant.
I know.
I got it back to the house, and I started thinking, maybe I was trying too hard.
I... I don't really even like the painting.
we don't like the same things, Sarah.
no, we...
it shouldn't be this hard, should it?
what are you saying, Roy?
I don't think this is working out.
are you breaking up with me?
Yes.
I like you, Sarah. I really do - You like me.
God, I...oh, my God. I bought you...
I bought you chocolates... chili pepper chocolates.
chili pepper chocolates?
they're an aphrodisiac. I can't believe it.
I got sucked into this whole Valentine's day thing, and I knew...I had a feeling deep down that things weren't wonderful, but I... I was...
trying. - Yes, trying. I've been trying.
like me.
you're right.
I am so sorry. You're right.
I've been trying to get my heart to follow my head.
Yeah.
obviously, I really want us to be friends.
Oh, me, too.
we can do that tomorrow.
sure. Yeah.
well, obviously, I can't accept this painting.
yeah... no. Yes, please.
this is not my painting anymore. I want you to have it.
you love it. Please keep it. Please?
Thanks.
how can you go on a fishing expedition like that without coming to her first?
I was gathering facts.
and when exactly did you first hear about this?
when you were runnin' for governor, someone noticed Kitty and Alec at the park.
with our children.
I'm sorry. I should've just asked you.
you know what? If you can't communicate any better than that, then she shouldn't be working for you.
maybe you and I should have this discussion alone.
you know what? The blonde hair and the southern drawl don't distract me.
I've run for this office, and I've won it twice.
Yes, but you're not the candidate this time, Robert.
I am. And, Buffy, I've done your job.
I know how hard it is. - Thank you.
but there is a fine line between doing what's right and doing what's right for your candidate.
and you need to come to me first next time, because if we can't trust each other, then we can't work together.
wait a minute. You're... you're keeping her on the payroll after what she's...
Robert, I appreciate your opinion, but, yes,
I need Buffy. And I hate to tell you this, Buffy, - but you're gonna be working all night. - What am I missin'?
well, I have found a venue for my announcement.
okay. Someone want to clue me in?
as you know, I'm running on family values, so I've decided to do it here, where I learned them.
and we're gonna do it tomorrow.
tomorrow?
announcing on a Sunday is a nightmare for the news cycle.
what part of "make it happen" do you not understand?
not a thing.
well, excuse me. I have some phone calls to make.
she's so out of touch, she doesn't even see the genius of doing it on Sunday...
Valentine's day.
wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I thought it was our sex-iversary.
you should put that on a banner behind you.
it'd be more famous than "I Like Ike.
sex-iversary.
well, I never thought I would find you here.
Hello, Nora.
what, are you packing up your office?
four years ago, Holly, you became a reality to me, and while I never imagined a world in which my husband's mistress would become a daily part of it, I accepted it.
I fought it, I didn't like it, but I accepted it.
I accepted you.
we've shared experiences, life...
we almost shared a grandchild together, and today of all days, when I looked you in the eye and we mourned the loss of that, the joining of our two families, you never bothered to tell me how you had betrayed mine.
Nora, please let me explain.
God, when I think of all the precious moments of my life
I have wasted trying to swallow my fury at you...
I was in a very difficult situation.
Oh, really? Is this about your money troubles?
good God. William left you more money than most people could dream about, and when you lost that, you sold his legacy and slithered away for your own profit.
it's always about money with you, Holly.
no, no. It's about survival.
well, congratulations! You made it through another day.
I canceled the deal.
I didn't sell my shares.
I read it in black and white.
it never happened.
what you read was a pending sale. I stopped it.
you couldn't have told me that when I walked in here?
this afternoon in the hospital...
when you said that I was family,
I realized that no money was worth losing that.
has anyone ever told you you're exhausting?
there's one more thing... - Oh, God. Now what?
this man that wants to buy my shares...
I'm telling you, he's trouble. - Why?
he knows something about the value of this company that was gonna make him very rich.
I have tried everything to figure out what that was.
that doesn't make any sense.
how could he know something about Ojai that we don't?
he knew William. They were business partners.
his name is Dennis York.
well, that changes everything.
Hello?
Oh, my God. You're early.
no, I'm not early. I said I'd be home by 8: 00.
I must've lost track of time.
I'm... I... I was gonna surprise you with your mom's brownies.
well, why are you doing that?
your mom said that they're your favorite.
no, Rebecca, why aren't you in bed resting?
I just told you. I wanted to surprise you for Valentine's day.
uh... well, I'm, uh, I'm surprised.
um... look, uh, I know you gotta eat something, so I... I got all your favorites.
I got split pea soup from the deli, cheese ravioli from the Italian restaurant on San Vicente.
I got chopped salad... garbanzo beans, no blue cheese.
and... if it's possible for you to love me any more...
cheesecake from Feinberg's.
I can't believe you went to all of those places.
well, now you gotta eat, so, uh, what do you want first?
um, yes, I will eat later.
right now I just have to keep stirring or the chocolate's gonna get dry.
well, all right. Let me stir it for you.
no, it's okay. I really want to do it myself.
well, I... look, I need you to eat something, all right?
I'm gonna eat when I'm done.
Rebecca, you know what? - Justin!
what? -Your mom gave me this recipe.
she talked me through how to do it.
I bought imported dark chocolate.
I bought a heart shaped brownie pan, and... I've been planning this for a long time, and right now,
I just... Ireally...need something to work out the way that I planned, okay?
I, uh...
I... I got you a Valentine's day present, too, but, um, in all the craziness, I... I think I left it at the hospital.
it's okay.
I can wait till next year.
you know, Valentine's day hardly ever happens on a weekend.
I was picturing... breakfast in bed.
instead we're spending it here in suits.
well, the good news...
the announcement is 20 minutes, but Valentine's is all day.
Mm. You know, I think we better stop, unless we want to end up on Youtube.
if Cooper gets to go to Disneyland, can I at least take off this necklace?
the pearls are choking me.
no, honey. That's what Republicans wear.
I've got right-wing hair, so suck it up.
can I at least wish Aunt Kitty good luck?
Yeah, just don't get in anyone's way, okay?
you look great.
God, I hate Valentine's day.
Oh, did you ever get Roy anything? - Yes. Chili pepper chocolate.
and we broke up.
wait. Seriously? - On Valentine's day?
it was a mutual decision. - I'm sorry.
no. It's the right thing.
I'll be alone for the rest of my life, but I'm fine.
it's true. Look at my track record.
my marriage fell apart.
every relationship since has fizzled.
Luc was too much of a good thing, and Roy... never really heated up.
that's a couple of misfires. You're still young.
exactly. And you look great.
right. Guys, come on. Stop it.
I mean, I'm good at a lot of things，my career, my kids.
I just... I have this one area of my life that I don't seem to be able to make work.
whoever said you can have it all is a big fat liar.
Oh, I needed that mimosa.
well, on the upside, Holly didn't sell her shares.
Oh, please don't start with that mess.
otherwise I'm gonna have to toss the juice and go to the straight grape.
okay, they're almost ready to start.
I can't believe the three of you are in here drinking While the GOP is out there denying global warming.
Thanks. That's it, just a little sip.
I'm so sorry. It's awful.
Oh, thanks. - Come here.
how's Rebecca?
okay, I guess.
um, she's, uh, she's here.
well, hey. Hey. I... I'll leave you two alone.
no, no. Hey, Rebecca, I'm so happy you came.
I mean, you totally didn't have to, but... - Oh, no. I wanted to.
how's Evan?
Oh, he's great. He's great.
you know, um...
well, I just know how... if you ever want to talk, I... I'm here.
Rebecca, I'm so glad you're here.
they're ready for you. - Oh, gosh. It's time.
okay, come on. Go see grandma.
come on. Let's go bye... ooh, what a big boy you are.
okay. Well... okay, wish me luck.
well... you have always looked good in red.
Whew. Oh, my goodness. - You nervous?
Yeah, I think, making a speech in front of a live audience is a very different thing than a one- on- one interview in the studio
your speech is great. Okay? You're gonna knock 'em dead.
I'll be sitting in the front row making faces at you.
no, Robert, you're not. We talked about this. I want you on the stage.
no. This moment needs to be about you.
I'll take my moment right now.
Kitty, it's time to meet your public.
Oh, hell.
I guess they've decided for us. - Yeah.
I don't understand.
that painting's already been paid for.
no, I don't want to return it. Look, I was just...
I was hoping that you could just credit the card of the man who bought it for me, and... and use mine instead.
of course. I'll get the paperwork.
thank you.
what's the matter? You don't like my painting?
this is your painting? - Oui.
no, I... I love it.
Oh, my God. I can't believe this.
Wh... what are you doing here?
uh, I've been... I've been working with this gallery.
I try to contact you. You never respond.
I couldn't.
he seems like a nice man... the one who bought it for you.
Oh, we're not... you know... - In love?
no. We're... we're just friends.
I'm glad to hear that.
so what did you love about my painting?
I, um...I loved the line in the middle...
the way it's trying to escape.
reminded me of something I lost.
what if the blue line is not trying to escape, but trying to find his way home?
well, that would be a whole different story.
I missed you. - Oh, my God.
you know I set my vehicle navigation to french?
I kept getting lost.
what, your boyfriend couldn't help you?
Oh, stop it. Come on.
you know I was on the rebound.
besides I thought I was never gonna see you again.
I texted you.
all you had to do was text back. --I know
I am sorry.
I should have listened to my heart.
well, it was fate that brought us back together.
of all the galleries in all the towns In all the world.
I had to walk into yours.
Casablanca.
do you think we're gonna work this time?
I know we will. -yeah?
how long have we got before your visa runs out?
six months?
a year?
let's not talk about that.
Oh, come on.
God, being with you-- it's a constant leap of faith.
you know, nothing is certain in this world, sarah.
all we have is faith.
you know I'm an agnostic.
I'm going to the gym.
you're going to the gym again?
soon you can bench-press me.
don't panic.
I'm just doing cardio.
all right.
so I'll just meet you at my mom's for dinner, right?
Oh, no.
I-I-I told your mom.
I-I didn't tell you.
I'm gonna have dinner with my dad tonight.
Oh, well, m-maybe you can switch it, Because my mom's doing that big dinner for Luc.
he just got back.
I know, but s-so did my dad.
so why don't we have dinner at my mom's tonight, And we'll have dinner at your dad's tomorrow?
that way we can, uh, stay together.
well, th-the thing is, he's free tonight.
and honestly, you know, I think it'd be good To hang out with him by myself for a little while.
okay.
are you.
are you gonna maybe talk about what happened?
Yeah, I'm sure we'll talk about lots of things.
I haven't seen him in weeks.
good.
well, I-I-- You know, I think it would be good if you what, spent the entire dinner talking about my miscarriage?
Justin, these things happen all the time. -- okay, Rebecca, not to us.
all right?
it's never happened to us, And every time I try and talk to you about it, You're running out the door.
cause I'd rather be at the gym.
I'd rather be having dinner with my dad, laughing.
I mean, wh-why can't you understand that?
I do. I do I just
I want to make sure you're dealing with it, all right?
Justin, I know you go to your n. a.
meetings And you talk about everything, and I think that's great.
but I'm fine.
I'm good, okay?
so just let me move on, please.
okay.
okay.
all right.
she's got us running around town Like the election is-- is next Tuesday.
I mean, I'm really starting to think that Buffy doesn't sleep.
Buffy mccreary--you know, my--my campaign manager.
I mean, how many Buffys do you know?
you'd beurprised.
what's the problem?
the problem is, w-we're friends, and so every time I tell her.
that she's bugging the crap out of me.
she just thinks I'm kidding.
well, she's just doing her job.
you hired her to get you out there.
Yeah, well, believe me, I'm out there.
I'm everywhere.
do you know where I have to go tomorrow?
no I have to go to a gun club in Glendale.
well, at least you don't have to go To the walt disney concert hall with Robert
to watch a rehearsal of ravel's "concerto for the le hand."
that sounds like a date.
Yes, it is.
you know what?
yesterday he made me go with him to Astroburger And split a turkey burger and real burger
so we could be "heart smart" together.
did you guys do the "two straw, one milk shake" thing?
it's not funny!
he's become clingy, And it's freaking me out.
it's like we're b. F.F. S suddenly.
I mean, come on.
you've gotta give Robert a break.
his term is winding down, And he's not as busy as he used to be,
and he doesn't know what to do with himself.
well, what am I supposed to do with myself?
a-are you telling me that you want to quit now?
Oh, I-- Because if you do you, you
telling a u. S.Senator That you want to date other people.
is not easy.
come on.
robert is a big boy.
he's gonna be fine.
he will handle it.
it-- you know, the truth is, I'm actually more worried about you.
I mean, Robert's not the only one who's losing his b. F.F.
breaking up is hard to do.
Holly tells me that you're gonna see her tomorrow.
Yes.
Yes, I am.
I can't believe Dennis York is back in our lives And Holly almost sold him her shares of Ojai foods.
I know, but she didn't sell it, Nora.
Ojai is ours.
that's what's important.
I'm just afraid.
when Dennis york wants something, He always finds a way of getting it.
well, he's not gonna get it this time.
he tried and he failed.
saul, listen.
what if Holly's right?
what if there is something hidden in the company, Something of value, and--and he knowabout it?
if that's true, Then Dennis is never gonna go away until he gets it.
mom, where are you?
uh, just a second.
remember, we're not telling the kids any of this.
as far as they know, It's just some random buyer who approached Holly.
would any of them even remember his name?
God, why couldn't he just take "no" for an answer and go away?
the guest of honor Is not really feeling very honored.
well, I-I thought fre french liked to take a lot of time when they eat.
they do, between courses.
we haven't even started.
all right. --Coming, coming!
what's up with her?
she's just excited to see Luc.
that's all. I'm very happy for you, too.
okay, well, just calm down.
let's see how it goes.
Oui. Absolument.
mais un coeur clos est lourd ?
sorry.
I was trying to get the poached eggs just right.
Yes.
je t'aime, Nora.
Oh, je t'aime, aussi.
well, excuse me.
I thought he came back for me.
Oh, no. He came back for all of us. Right, luc?
Yeah, our dance steps have gotten rusty.
that's right.
how was the wedding?
I have so much to catch up on.
wedding didn't happen.
twice.
the first time, because of a hurricane.
Yeah, then Kitty fainted on the beach.
so basically, don't ask, 'cause we'll be here all night.
but everybody's fine now.
well, good,'cause I.
can't even tell you how happy I am to see everyone.
Hey, what are you, uh, what are you doing Saturday?
we never got you on the, uh, surfboard.
you were going to teach me how to shoot some pipe And get totally hell-munched.
Hell-medched?
wait a minute.
Kevin and Scotty and I are taking Luc To the huntington gardens on Saturday.
what? --But you're invited, Sarah.
Oh, gee, thanks, mom.
you--you and I have plans, Luc.
that's right. The movie.
Yes.
I-I got tickets to the jean renoir retrospective.
I think I overbooked myself.
well, it's not like we knew how long we were gonna have you for, right?
Yeah.
uh, is there still a problem with your visa?
Yes, um, my tourist visa is running out.
Kevin made some phone calls for me, but.
but he's been in and out of the country so many times now, at this point, they won't renew it.
why don't you guys just get hitched?
hitched? -what?
it would make him a citizen.
it's like a no-brainer, right?
Justin, it's also a very big step.
Yeah, but you know you love him.
Oh, come on. Get married. --Come on, stop it.
no, we're not getting married.
I know you would like us to marry so that you could spend endless time together.
now, everybody, just stop.
they're not ready to talk about marriage yet.
it's just to keep him in the country. that all
you know what?
Justin, why don't you marry him?
I'm engaged or I would.
Oh, Saul, Saul, you could marry him.
Yeah, I could marry him.
except, thanks to our state government, we no longer have that right.
look, there's probably a thousand women in this city That would marry Luc in a heartbeat.
God knows, I'm available.
like my mom.
all right, seriously, You can get married for a green card.
people do it all the time.
actually my--my art dealer has been offering to marry me years now.
who? Ginny? --Yeah.
as a business arrangement.
you never told me that.
no, Luc, you're not-- you're not really gonna do that?
come on. It would just be a piece of paper, that's all.
Sarah, put a stop to this right now.
well, if it's between that and him being shipped back to Bordeaux.
well, are you considering this?
well, he.
doesn't have that much time.
wait a second.
how long do you have?
uh, I don't know.
he--he won't talk about it.
how long is it, Luc?
six months or.
actually four weeks.
no, y-you mean months.
a week has seven days.
Yeah.
I'm--I'm sorry. I didn't want to worry you.
I was hoping to, uh, fix this on my own.
Oh, my god.
well, don't worry, honey. Don't worry.
we're not gonna let Luc go without a great big fight.
four weeks?
I'm sorry, Sarah.
all right.
you'll pop off a couple dozen rounds, Show these folks you're handy with that 9,
and then we'll mosey on down to the clubhouse.
and drop that speech on them, okay?
can you please stop talking like you're on "hee haw"?
all right, boys.
don't be shy.
who wants a shot of Annie Oakley here?
that's nice.
now smile.
there we go.
all right.
okay, that's good.
back up.
give her some space.
Hey, did you get those changes in the speech I sent you yesterday?
Oh, daggone it, anyway.
you know what I did?
I gone and left it down on the homestead.
Kitty Walker, you just don't want to do my changes.
you're right, because I actually do support a firearm ban on California convicts.
Hey, you utter the word "ban" in front of this crowd,
and they're gonna be shooting more than just photohsaphs.
Oh, my god!
what--what, did you get shot?
your shoes.
what happened to the pumps we agreed on?
Oh, my god.
this is a gun club.
I am not about to wear high heels.
well, they looked so cute, and, quite frankly, you could use the height.
and since when don't you listen to my fashion advice?
since we're not in our 20-somethings.
okay?
now--now listen to me.
I am running for senate now.
we are not trolling Georgetown looking for bars.
okay?
I want the voters to know that I can make really tough decisions, like what put on my feet.
okay, well, Kitty.
I'm gonna have an opinion about what's on your feet
and what's on your head and everything in between.
it's my job.
you don't happen to have a photo of yourself, do you?
on me?
no, why?
no reason.
bull's-eye.
you think Kitty shot Buffy yet?
not yet, but I give that marriage lessn han a month.
Robert, do you think we could talk?
about what?
W-w-well, it's just, um.
me.
I.
you know, it's just-- I'm trying to figure things out-- it's okay. i get it
you do?
well, yeah.
I'm not running for governor.
I've given up the senaea seat.
things seem a little up in the air, and you're wondering how you fit in.
well, actually I thought maybe now was the time, you know.
do you remember the meeting I took With the institute for republican thought?
an oxymoron, but, yes.
Itsnoesn't exist.
it was about a job.
what kind of job?
I can't talk about it.
Wh-what, am I supposed to play 20 questions now?
suffice it to say, it's an opportunity that I've been looking for for a long time,
and most guys, I mean, they don't even get the call.
all right, Bruce Wayne.
does the job come with a cape and a mask?
this job is.
big.
and if it happens, there's gonna be a place at the table for you.
Robert, you have to give me more than that.
can't do it.
look, I-I just want you to know that I depend on you.
I mean, we're a team.
you're just gonna have to trust me on that.
at about this trip to montreal that William took in 1976?
do you know anything about that?
Yes, I do.
I was there.
it was the summer olympics,
and I spent the entire time trying to figure out William's fascination for the pentathlon.
Oh, god.
do you remember William's running phase?
Ah, yes.
he would get so cranky If he didn't get his 7 miles in every day.
he would run omfrom your house to my house In one of those hideous neon tracksuits.
Yeah. right well no offense, Holly, but I really don't think William's old tracksuits are the key to saving this company.
O-okay, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to say something--say anything that-- no.
no. It's fine.
I'm over it.
this treasure hunt is a big old wild-goose chase.
York told me That there was a boatload of money under this company.
I mean, he was even willing to make me a partner.
Yeah, well, nom not convinced.
Dennis wanted Ojai.
I think he would've said practically anything to get it.
well, how well did you know him?
I.
didn't know him very well.
he worked with William, that's all.
william screwed him over, and Dennis went to prison, And it was all a very long time ago.
but if you can remember anything that might help-- well, I don't.
I don't remember anything.
I don't remember anything, and if I do, I will give you a call.
okay.
Holly, uh, you know, I would appreciate it
if you didn't mention any of this about Dennis To the kids just yet.
of cours hi!
Oh, there.
sorry I'm late.
remember Ginny, from the gallery?
Yes, of course.
thank you for coming on such short notice.
Yeah, well, I had to get Luc toign some papers For the art show in mexico anyway.
I am loving the new work he's producing.
he's never been short on inspiration.
on time, maybe.
Yeah, he said you only have four weeks?
I guess he told you last night, I've been offering to marry him for years.
before Sarah, I never had any good reason.
so does the offer still stand?
Yeah.
I mean, if it helps you, I'd be more than happy.
okay, what would it entail?
well, it's simple.
we just go down to city hall and sign some papers.
you make it sound like you're getting a fishing license.
pretty much, except, in this case, they might check up on us periodically,
so we just have to make sure we look like a real couple.
what, do you just take a bunch of cute snapshots together?
no, no.
I-I-- We need, kind of, to live together for some time.
but we can make it work.
my boyfriend is totally on board with this.
Oh, y-y--and he doesn't mind you marrying Luc?
no.
and, anyway, it's a 3-bedroom, so this whole arrangement would be no problem.
well, you really do sound like you have thought it through.
we did, yeah.
look, obviously, you guys need to talk.
actually, no, I don't think so.
as you said, it's a business arrangement.
and it makes sense.
okay.
that's the thing.
um, we need to do this before Ginny gtos to Mexico.
right. We talked about that.
I have to be there for a while,
and I think it might look a little suspicious if Luc getting married a couple days before his visa runs out.
Ah, yes.
good point.
so when do you have to leave?
well.
tomorrow.
but that would mean you'd have to get married today.
that would be soon.
look, we can talk about it some more if you want.
no, I'm fine.
I'm fine.
this afternoon.
it's great. I can't make it.
um, I've got to get back or work, but it's not like you need me there anyway.
this afternoon it is.
should we make it official.
Monsieur?
Congratulations.
I know the last person in the world You want to hear about is Dennis York,
but you are giving him too much power.
he can't do anything to hurt us, Nora.
Yeah.
Nora, you're being paranoid.
I mean it.
you forget how far back this all goes.
and the person who was there from the very beginning was Dennis York.
right. i know
and I'm sure that Dennis did things for William That are best left where they are,
but as you said, that was a lifetime ago, Nora.
who would even care about that?
and anyway, he'd only be implicating himself.
what if he goes after the kids?
what--what--what are you talking about, the kids?
Oh, I don't know.
nothing.
I'm being paranoid.
saul, would you do me a favor?
would you find out where he is?
I need to know if he's gone or not.
of course, sweetheart.
Yes, I will.
I'll take care of it.
just Saul, are we gonna have a chance to go over these.
why is it that every time I walk into a room,
you two look like you're having a very private conversation?
well, actually, we were talking about you and Luc.
Yeah, is everything all right?
have you--have you gotten rid Of that whole ridiculous green card marriage thing?
not exactly.
Where's the car, Buffy?
that was Brian.
he'll be here any sec.
Oh, my goodness!
look at that.
it's a little gun.
straight shooter.
Oh, isn't that cute?
if he's late because he went to go pick up my high heels, I promise you, I will kill you.
honey, the heels will be worth it.
Oh, my god.
you know what?
we're not gonna have time to make that yacht club.
we're gonna have to cancel.
are you kiddin'? Republicans love boats. Plus, those people are
you know what? I'm the candidate, And I say we reschedule.
we--we resuledule.
uh, no can do, little lady.
little what?
don't start poutin'. I'm just doin' my job.
no.
you know what? No, you're not.
you're not anymore. You're not.
you know what you are? You're fired.
what?
you're fired, you're fired, you're fired, you're fired.
fired, fired, fired. --okay heyhey
I know you gave up decaf.
okay, I get it.
Buffy, I'm serious.
Oh, honey, I know you're serious,
and normally I'd act all hurt and I'd scurry off to the hotel,
and I'd wait for you to apologize tomorrow,
but frankly, our schedule doesn't allow us such luxuries.
so why don't we just just chalk this up as done and behind us, and move on, okay?
no.
no, no--not--not--not "'kay.
this is--this is the thing.
this is-- D-d-do you-- do you see the problem?
do you see the problem? You're not listening to me.
I am firing you, and you're still not listening to me.
Buffy, I mean it.
we have to part ways.
no, I can't do it.
it would be disastrous to this campaign.
okay, here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna take this call. --yes
and when I turn around, you're gonna be gone.
Hello?
Kitty, it's us.
Hi, Kitty.
Hi.
listen, Kitty, we need your help.
Luc is marrying his art dealer in two hours.
what?
for his green card.
mom, would you just calm down?
listen, Kitty. This is a good thing.
no, no, no, no. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Sarah.
there is nothing good about a green card marriage.
green card marriage?
all I wanted to do was discuss the sales projections.
I don't even know why I told you.
we need you to help us figure out what she should do.
Oh, is that Sarah?
is she gonna marry the french guy?
would you--would you please go away?
you two need to understand my reality.
Luc's visa will run out in four weeks.
but that's four weeks.
honey, you should tell him to wait.
we'll figure out something for--for you guys to do.
I don't want you to get hurt.
mom, I will be hurt y my boyfriend is deported.
okay?
it's a business transaction.
Sarah, w-why don't you just marry Luc?
why would you even ask me that?
what is wrong with you people?
because if I were ever to marry Luc, it would be because I would like to spend the rest of my life with him,
not for a green card.
so in the meantime, He's marrying his art dealer.
Yes, exactly.
do you want to know where we are, Sarah?
we back at cranberry ball.
remember? Remember Michael Mizlanski? --yeah
Yeah, well, you were afraid to ask him to the dance, so he went ahead and asked somebody else.
and Suzy and Michael are married now.
Really?
Hey, could I get an update, please?
would you--no.
I fired you.
Sarah, listen to me.
do you love him?
see, why should I even have to say that out loud?
we've been back together barely a week.
Sarah, do you love him?
I don't know.
probably. -probably
Yes.
Yes, I love him, okay?
sweetheart, that's wonderful.
no, it's not wonderful, mom, because life is a lot more complicated than that.
he knows that I love him.
I told him that I loved him a long time ago, but it was still too hard,
and he left me and he went back to France.
Yeah, but he came back.
that's the thing, Sarah.
he's doing all of this for you.
we've gotta go to city hall.
we have to go to city hall.
Kitty, meet us there. --yeahyeah --No, no, I can. --Kitty, meet us at city hall.
I'm on my way. I'll be there. I'll be there as soon as I get my car.
What'?
I have a wedding to stop.
I need my car, Buffy.
uh, this is me getting your car.
Hello?
Buffy. Yes, Brian, we need it now.
Hey, world traveler.
Hi.
Hey, welcome back.
Thanks.
is Rebecca here?
uh, Rebecca is not here.
no.
just, uh, just me.
I just wanted to check in.
I'm sorry about the miscarriage.
you doing okay?
uh, yeah.
Yeah, I guess.
you know, it was a-- it was a tough week.
how's Rebecca doing?
um, I don't know.
you know, every time I try and talk to her, she's t the door, so.
you would probably know better than I do.
no.
she's not answering her cell phone, so everything I hear is pretty much secondhand from Holly.
that's why I was hoping to see her today.
wait.
uh, didn't--didn't you have dinner with her last night?
last night?
no, I just came here from the airport.
my stuff's still in the car.
what's going on?
I don't know.
I--last night she said she was having dinner with you.
that's not true.
look, do you know where she is?
no.
no.
Yeah.
do you have em memo for the committee?
Nope.
what have you been doing?
something big.
Oh, I updated your web page.
I thought "robert mccallister, U.S. senator" was a little too specific, so now it just says"robe, a man."
I don't think the Californians who support you Should know too much about exactly what it is you do.
runners-up did include "robert mccallister, national man of mystery"
and "mccallister"-- don't ask, he won't tell.
all right, all right.. Shut the door.
should we go down to the bat cav
I told you, I'll tell you about this job when I can talk about it.
so what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
your job.
Robert, I feel trapped.
trapped? yes
and this whole best buddy routine-- It does not make things any easier.
do you want to go to couples therapy?
no, I do not.
I would like you to take this seriously.
then maybe you should be a little more direct.
I want to move on.
and I'm sorry.
it doesn't matter what this new job is.
it--it doesn't matter what it is.
it would be your dream and not mine.
I accept your resignation.
excuse me?
well, I mean, isn't that what you're saying?
you wanna go? go
I mean, I-I'm just unhappy to hear that you're so miserable.
okay, but if you want your freedom, you should--you should have it, I mean, by all means.
I wish you nothing but the best.
fine.
two weeks notice okay?
don't worry about it.
consider today your last day.
okay.
here are your talking points.
so I'd go easy on Espinoza.
I hear he's about to lose the finance chair, so he might be a little sensitive on spending.
Oh, Kevin?
Yeah.
write out your letter of resignation, make it official.
fine.
good.
listen, I'm wondering if you've heard any more about York.
no, he hasn't contacted me, but I can't stop thinking about him.
what do you mean?
well, I finally realized that I was doing this all wrong.
I've spent all this time going over all the files of Ojai When I should have been investigating York.
look at this.
narrow Lake development group.
two weeks ago, when he thought that I was gonna sell him my shares, He filed for ad. B.A. under that name.
right.
so what does that mean?
I found this bill from 1973
a geological survey William was doing on several parcels of land, Including one named.
narrow Lake.
doesn't that mean anything to you?
no.
York wanted Ojai so he could get Narrow Lake.
so this it?
now all we need to know is where it is.
I mean, it's n mentioned in any of the other Ojai files, Just this survey for $500.
I don't know.
it's as if the purchase was covered up.
right.
okay, so William looked at a lot of land in those days. --right
he must have surveyed thousands of acres.
and some of them weren't even in California.
well, then we have our work cut out for us. --right
but at least we know we're not kidding ourselves.
at least we know what we're looking for.
at last, I feel that we are getting ahead of Dennis York.
Oh, I can't wait to tell Nora.
listen, let me tell her, okay?
I'm gonna see her tonight.
okay.
she's gonna be really excited.
don't let me interrupt.
I'm just grabbing snack.
Rebecca, what's going on?
what do you mean?
your father stopped by.
he just got in this morning.
you're unbelievable.
where were you last night?
last I checked, I didn't need to ask permission to leave the apartment.
Rebecca, where have you been going?
all right, I-I just want to find out what's going on.
Justin, nothing has been going on.
I'm sorry if I wasn't raised in a family of brothers and sisters
who blab about their feelings all the time.
I don't even think that's healthy.
I think that when something bad happens, You get up and you get moving, and that's what I'm doing.
Yeah, but where are you going?
that's what I'm asking you! --I have a dance class!
you haven't-- you haven't been dancing Since you were 15 years old.
Yeah, well.
you want to know where I'm going?
I'm going to 6th and Fairfax, if you must know.
I'll be there every night until I'm not.
Kevin, you have to help me.
well, I don't know what it is you think I can do, Buffy.
talk to Kitty.
I mean, how am I supposed to do my job if she keeps firing me?
I don't think she wants you to do your job.
that's I'm on the phone with Kitty.
she's at city hall.
good lord.
tell me they haven't gotten married yet.
is that Buffy?
Yes, it is.
Oh, my god.
what do I have to do to get rid of her?
we hope to find a map.
Oh, god.
he still not answering his phone, mom.
this is political suicide.
=listen, I agree with her.
w-well, yes, robert, of course.
that's what we're doing here.
we're trying to stop him.
okay, we're going through the x-ray machine.
I-I gotta go.
what in the world?
what are you still doing here?
I'm packing.
I'll be gone by the end of the day.
well, take everything.
I'm gonna need this office for the next guy.
are you crying?
you guys love each other.
don't you get it?
would you pull yourself together?
it's embarrassing.
what is taking so long?
seriously, do they really think this little old lady is gonna blow up the building?
maybe it's a sign.
maybe it's a sign that Ginny and Luc are supposed to get married.
just stop. All right? stop --Oh, that's ridiculous, Sarah.
well-- Uh, pardon me, ma'am. Could we go, uh, ahead of you?
we're in an awful hurry, and my daughter has to stop a wedding that's gonna happen in--in minutes here.
I'd rather not get involved. --oh no.
we'll--we'll pay you.
50 bucks.
$40. -mam
Okay,$50. -thank you
done.
there you go.
thank you so much.
all right, in we go.
okay.
we're in a hurry.
come on, mom, mom.
go, go, go, go.
what?
stop right there, miss.
code 9. firearm --What's happening? --is this your bag, ma'am?
Oh, wait a minute.
this is actually kind of-- it's kind of funny.
it's not a real gun.
I-I was-- I need you to stand over here.
no, no.
I won it today.
I was at an award thing.
it's a plaque.
I won it as an award.
it's not a real gun.
I can show it to you.
excuse me.
step over there.
we really need-- I need you to stay right there.
I can't believe this is happening.
no, no, no.
you don't understand. It's not a real gun.
it's not a real-- I think you need to listen to my daughter.
you, too, ma'am.
stay right here.
Oh, my god.
I can't believe this.
pli?
pass?
Relev?
Sous-sous.
other side.
Relev?
again.
pli?
and stretch.
pli?
are you my stalker now?
what?
I'm not stalking you.
you gave me the address.
I figured I'd come watch you dance.
no. h--Justin, what are you doing here?
I told you I need space.
Rebecca, first of all, all I do is give you space, but it's--it's not helping.
well, you can't help me.
I have to do this on my own.
okay, well, is this helping, the dancing? --yes
Yes.
no. I don't know.
I used to be good at this.
this used to be easy for me.
now I can barely stay on my feet.
okay, well, maybe.
maybe it's just too soon.
I thought that.
if I went back to doing something that I knew I was good at, That it would all make sense, but.
it doesn't.
it's too hard.
my body keeps letting me down.
I feel so broken.
I'm sorry.
what are we gonna do now?
I guess we try again.
we start over.
I don't know if I can do that.
all right, look, Rebecca, you're--you're--you're talking to a recovering drug addict.
I know a thing or two about starting over.
and you know what?
it takes time, all right?
and sometimes you gotta go back to the basics and--and--and work the steps, but we can do it.
I promise you that.
just don't give up.
Oh, hey.
you're home early.
Yeah.
could you, um, sit down for a second?
okay.
what's with the box?
I quit today.
I know. I'm sorry. I should have discussed it with you first.
I mean, you realize we're in the middle of the greatest economic downturn since the depression?
I know.
I kn--I had to do it.
I-I just had to do it.
I'm-- I don't know what's happening to me, but I-I couldn't be this person anymore.
okay.
well, I-I-I guess we knew this was coming, right?
Yeah, just not today.
well, we'll.
we'll figure it out.
thank you.
look at me.
I'm 38 years old.
I thought I would've had things figured out by now.
Kevin, you're talking to somebody who used to sleep in his car.
feeling lost and aimless?
Yeah.
join the club.
I mean, it's like standard operating procedure for the rest of us.
you're not mad?
of course not.
I'm proud of you.
you did a brave thing.
I don't feel brave.
I practically ran out of there.
I didn't even say good-bye.
well, that's just wrong.
I know, but I'll call Robert tomorrow.
Oh, my god.
it's him.
well--well, answer it.
well, I-I don't want to.
Kevin, what are you, 6?
Hello?
Oh, hi.
uh, what, right now?
sure.
I'll come over.
o-- What does he want?
I have no idea.
sir, could you tell me where they took my daughter?
it's too late, mom.
they'll already be married.
no, don't say that.
honey, you saw that line downstairs.
everything in this building moves like molasses.
I can't believe I pulled another cranberry ball.
no, you haven't.
it's not like he's left the country.
you can still tell him how you feel.
he has a wife, and I know it's not true, but why do I feel so sick about it?
because, Sarah, you're in love with this man, and you don't want him to marry anyone else but you.
mm, you tried to tell me.
I couldn't hear it.
look, Sarah, if we don't make it, and--and we're too late,
and Luc and Ginny are married, it doesn't matter.
do you hear me?
i-it doesn't matter.
you just have to work very hard from now on to be honest with yourself and honest with him.
if you feel something, anything, you can't be afraid to tell him, Whether it's good or bad.
the two of you love each other.
any moron could see that.
and you both have to work very hard to protect it.
it's not too late?
no.
Thanks, mom.
doesn't this move you in any way?
ma'am, I watch "oprah."
nothing surprises me.
okay, we're free.
Oh, god. We're free.
just a little mix-up, ladies.
okay.
Mrs. Mccallister, you definitely have my vote.
Oh, well, thank you.
is-is he married yet?
how the hell do I know?
can we still make it?
I think we can make it.
come on.
Kitty Mccallister, senator, 2010.
this woman and this man have come before us to be joined in the state of matrimony,
witnessed and vested before me in the state of California.
take hands and repeat after me--I-- Luc!
is he married yet?
excuse me. It's okay.
they're with me.
and who are you? she's with him.
Luc, I'm sorry.
I'm not cool with this.
I thought I was.
I-I tried to be, but I'm not.
I'm not.
but then--then I started thinking, I was afraid, and there was Suzy Lang, and you came back for me.
Sarah, english is not his first language.
Luc, I love you.
I love you, too.
wait.
are you two gonna get married now?
no.
no, we're not.
don't tell me you have never seen "the graduate."
well, Dustin Hoffman is madly in love with this girl, Elaine,
but she's about to marry the wrong guy.
so he bursts into the church, and she leav the other guy at the altar.
and so what happened next?
that's it.
they just stare at each other.
then they get this look over their faces like, "what have we done?"
yes?
I'm in here.
Oh, good.
God, I wish you'd been there.
what a riot.
I-I think it's easier to plan a wedding than it is to stop one.
listen, we have to talk.
what?
have you ever heard of Narrow Lake?
Why?
william must have bought it in 1973.
listen to this.
Holly found out that York opened a "doing business as" Under that name, Narrow Lake.
we think this might be pay dirt, nora.
Yes, I've--I've heard of Narrow Lake.
you have?
well, that's great. That's great.
So--so--so do you know where it is?
no.
let's go out tonight for our own sake ?
and visit a place that I call Narrow Lake ?
it's a song.
william used to sing it all the time.
it's a song.
it's just a little ditty.
this could be the hidden value of Ojai foods, Nora.
did you find out where he is?
no. No, he was staying at a hotel downtown.
he checked out a few weeks ago.
he'll be back.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god, Buffy, you just don't go away.
consider me fired.
Really? yes
I was just dropping off some wine for you as a thank-you gift for giving me a shot.
are you trying to make me feel guilty?
because I do.
no, I'm not. I'm not, really.
I just wanted to tell you that I love you and I'm gonna miss you.
Really?
really.
I guess I'll--I'll leave you to it.
uh, and I dropped a c-note on this wine, so promise me you'll drink it with robert and not on a campaign bus.
Oh, no, no.
that--that's not gonna happen, because I think you and I have to drink this bottle together.
well, you know me. I never turn down a drink.
true.
but I'm not gonna hold your hair back this time.
Oh, no, no.
I-I can drink.
I--I'm good at it now.
look, I know you think this is a good idea, but I really don't want to know what this job is.
you know me and my family.
we can't keep secrets.
Yeah, but you deserve to know, and there's no pressure.
you can still leave if you want.
why did I have to come back here?
because we needed a secure room.
I've had my office swept for bugs.
swept for bugs?
Robert, please don't tell me.
don't worry. I've had you cleared for this information.
okay, you know what? I can't be trusted.
I'm--I'm actually ticklish.
I'd be one feather away from telling al qaeda everything.
just.
it doesn't matter what it is.
I'm not gonna change my mind.
no, I'm not gonna change my mind. I am not ...
we're gonna miss you.
great job.
all right, all right, get this man a drink.
Kevin and I have been through a lot.
a campaign, a heart attack.
and a few scandals.
and we have disagreed.
we, uh, we disagree a lot.
Kevin has done more than argue.
he's taught us that our beliefs are worth fighting for,
even if we don't know exactly where they're gonna take us.
Kevin, you can't possibly know how you've transformed our work and our lives.
and from now on, when I have to make a decision,
I'm gonna take a moment-- not a big one, not like, you know, forever
but I'm gonna take a moment, and I'm gonna ask myself, "what would Kevin do?"
to Kevin walker, my brother.
to whatever you do in the future.
in politics, as in life, there are no endings, only new beginnings.
here's to the start of something new.
you didn't real think I was gonna tell you about the job, did you?
I hate you.
do you have any regrets?
about today?
remember when I said we need to have faith?
and you said I was talking to an agnostic.
I know now it's not true.
you believe in us.
I do.
four weeks.
four weeks.
four weeks.
Oh, wow.
Yeah.
it's amazing, isn't it...
how two little words can make our lovemaking even more passionate?
Oh, god. When I say,"don't stop," you really don't stop.
not those two words.
je t'aime.
I love you, too.
I can't believe that in three weeks, two days and...
what time is it?
eight hours, if you don't have a visa, you'll be on a plane to France.
stop calculating.
we promised to live in the present.
Ugh. I am, I am.
and right now in the present, I'm upset that my government, to whom I pay taxes, by the way, is lurking in my bedroom waiting to ruin my life.
I love how you think.
the entire government is out there to get you.
well, this is a very big problem.
you know what I think?
what?
I think the problems of two little people don't amount to hill of beans in this crazy world.
as adorable as you are, imitating Humphrey Bogart with your little french accent,
I don't think we should quote from "casablanca" anymore, because I know how it ends...
two people in tears in an airport...
on a foggy night.
don't say anything.
good morning, leisure man.
good morning, hunky breadwinner.
and just so you know, I'm not gonna be leisure man forever.
there are many exciting careers just waiting for someone like me.
such as? - Well, I don't know yet.
I have to finish my careers assessment test.
of the following, which activities most appeal to you?
"working on mathematical problems." no.
"recording customer complaints." no.
"teaching needy children overseas." yes.
Uh,"giving orders to others." - yes.
Yes.
"tapping maple trees for sugar."
why not?
"giving legal advice." No. Did that. hated it. Not a chance.
"designing lamps." Absolutely.
Wow."planning a political campaign."
bite your tongue, you stupid test.
wait. Scotty, look at this.
I'm not suited for anything.
well, what about lamps and maple syrup?
the only things I am suited for are law and politics, and I don't want to go back to that.
I'm a complete failure. - Stop it, Kevin.
you are not a failure.
well, name one thing I'm good at.
well, you were pretty good in bed last night.
Yes, I was, wasn't...
Hey, let's do that again.- Oh, I-I-I can't.
I have a breakfast meeting at san estephe with my boss, so I-i...
Oh, come on. Daytime sex is one of the few perks of unemployment.
come on. Come on.
okay, but we have to be quick.
leisure man can be so speedy when necessary.
don't answer that.
the only people who call the landline are telemarketers and wrong number.
well, it's...It's "private.
what if it's my boss calling to cancel?
then maybe you should answer it.
hello. - Hi, Scotty. It's Sarah.
listen, um... - Oh, yeah. Hi. Just a sec.
it's Sarah.
why did...
what kind of sneaky person blocks their caller i. d.
well, look, i'm in an emergency, and I didn't have time to play your little voice mail game so that you'd call me back.
what emergency?
okay, listen, Kevin, you have got to help Luc get his visa renewed.
come on. You're a lawyer.
there's gotta be something that you can do.
Sarah, I'm not an immigration lawyer, okay?
I put a call in to the immigration attorney at my old firm.
that is all I can do.
no, Kevin. There's got to be something else you can do.
hello. - Scotty, it's Kitty.
Hi, Kitty.
she says it's an emergency.
hang on a second.
Kevin-1-1. What's your emergency?
very funny, Kevin.
look, I need you to go to a couple of campaign events with me today.
okay? Please. I am desperate.
kit, I do not work for you.
remember? You have staff.
I know I have staff, but I hate my staff.
so I promise you won't have to do anything.
I just need somebody with a sense of humor to hang out with me.
okay, what about Sarah? She makes you laugh. Hang on.
Sarah, make Kitty laugh.
Kitty, I'm talking to Kevin. - Well, so was I.
well, I called him first.
wait. - I'm sorry, sweetie.
I have to go. - Sarah, I need him.
please don't go. I'm sorry.
I love you. - I love you, too.
no, no, Kevin! Kevin. Kevin.
one demanding, needy, high-maintenance sister at a time, please.
I heard about this other kind of visa... - No, don't you call me "high maintenance..."
all right, come on, Nora.
just please run through this one more time.
would you stop doing that? Come on. Just relax.
fine, fine, fine. - Close your eyes and...Here you go.
let's go out tonight for our own sake ?
and visit a place that I call Narrow Lake ?
where Saul can't pester me to sing this stupid song ?
Oh, for...That's not funny. I'm trying help you, and you're...
you're not taking it seriously. - I'm sorry. I don't remember it.
where our only hope of finding this piece of property is if I can remember some stupid lyrics, well, I think we should just give up.
well, I'm not ready to give up.
and neither is Holly.
well, even if we find it, we don't know it'll be worth anything.
and we don't know that this is actually what Dennis York is after.
what are you talking about?
he filed to do business as Narrow Lake development group.
there's nothing ambiguous about that.
and furthermore, York was willing to pay Holly more than ojal is worth.
there's no other conclusion to make.
well, then what's he waiting for, huh?
why doesn't he call me and make an offer for our half of the company?
I don't know. Maybe he plans to make an end run and approach the kids first.
no.
no, I don't want him to talk to the kids.
well, then I'll contact him.
I'll just set up a meeting and force his hand.
no, I don't want you to talk to him either, Saul.
I don't trust him.
well, sweetheart, until we find out where and what Narrow Lake is, that man is holding all the cards.
okay, mom. What is going on?
seriously. - God. You scared me.
it's beautiful outside, it's Saturday, Dad was gone for, like, three weeks, and you're stuck in your office with the shades drawn.
when I open them, there's a glare on my computer screen.
well, you shouldn't be on your computer.
I'm just catching up on bills.
mom, seriously, what is so important?
I mean, like, what is...What is all this stuff?
why are you look at files from 1975?
that's from another project.
they're all going back to storage today.
mom, what project involves files from 35 years ago?
you know, sweetie, you really...You don't want to know. Trust me.
it's just business.
no, it's not just business when you're here on beautiful Saturdays.
this is your life.
okay, mom...
we have come way too far for this.
you gotta tell me what's going on.
has David told you anything?
just that Ojal is in more financial trouble.
Yeah, that's true. The company is broke.
and so am I.
what?
I made this terrible investment...
Oh, god. Who am I kidding?
I lost it all in a ponzi scheme.
Wh-when?- A few months ago.
a few mo...W - why didn't you tell me?
I'm sorry. I should've told you.
but I was afraid you would worry. Oh, please don't worry.
I have this idea of how to make ojal solvent again, and maybe if I am really lucky,
I will make up some of the personal money I lost.
mom, I am your daughter and I love you.
let me help you.
okay.
excuse me.
what could I get for you?
I'm glad to see you.
Hello, Dennis.
I was so happy to get your call.
actually, I was just about to call you.
I figured as much.
when I turn the key, there's a whirring noise, and it's a brand-new battery, so it can't be that.
is it, like, a clicking sound?
no, it's not a clicking sound.
it's more of a groan.
could you just tell me when you could get here, please?
uh, about three hours. - No! God, no. No, no.
I have a million things to do.
I can't wait that long.
I fixed it.
uh, just a sec. What's that?
Yeah, it was the alternator.
it's all fine now.
just hang up the phone.
actually, my boyfriend fixed it.
it was the alternator.
everything's fine.
so thank you and au revoir.
I cannot get by without you.
if you go back to France, my life's gonna fall apart.
the mailman just delivered it.
it's from the state department.
kiss me. I'm legal.
you're what?
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
Really? - Yeah.
Really?
how's your mother?
Ida's fine, thanks.
and the kids?
everybody's fine, Dennis.
is Tommy still up in Seattle?
that's none of your business.
and I find it kind of disturbing you know that.
you seem tougher than you used to be...
colder.
but I guess you've been through a lot the last few years.
Oh, really? You think?
maybe cleaning up William's mess might have changed me?
I don't know.
you seem to have adjusted well.
you've made peace with Holly Harper.
let's just cut the small talk, all right?
Dennis, I don't know why you want to buy the company so badly, but it's not gonna happen.
even if I wanted to sell it, I couldn't.
of course you could.
it belongs to you and your family.
and they all have shares.
do you expect me to convince them all to sell?
Yes, I do.
and you will.
or I'll tell them all what happened.
I don't get it. My mom lives alone, and she always has a ton of leftovers.
I know. It's mystifying.
here. - Thanks.
Oh, hey. - hey.
Hey. Nora, I'm so sorry to barge in like this.
I told Justin, it's...It's a little...
although I explained it to her.
if you didn't want me to use my key, you would changed the locks a long time ago.
no, I'm...
I'm really glad to see you.
help yourself. I'm...I have some things to do upstairs first.
wait. Um, before you go upstairs, um, Rebecca wants to talk to you about something.
please let it be good news. Yeah. What?
what's the matter? - Nothing.
what is it, Rebecca?
o - okay.
well, Nora, you know how I felt when my mom gave me that money from William's estate.
you know, I was...I was angry and ashamed and I-I kinda knew that everybody thought I didn't deserve it.
no one thought that.
Nora, it was $2 million.
full disclosure...I thought it was a little excessive.
exactly, which is why I gave it to you to hold on to.
but I think I know what I want to do with it now.
really, what?
well, my mom and I have come a long way since then, and...
I think I want to give it to her and Ojal.
How...How much of it do you want to give to her?
all of it.
what?
ma, look, you know I-I stay out of the whole Ojal thing, but we know the...
the company's in bad shape.
Yeah, and we just found out about Narrow Lake and...
Yeah, which kind of blows my mind.
I mean, how come you didn't tell us about that?
well, we don't know where Narrow Lake...
it...it may not even exist.
well, exactly. And see, this is why I want to give her the money...
so it'll give her the time to figure it out.
you know, I mean, she has a strong hunch about this.
and I...And I really want to support her.
has...has your mother ag-agreed to this?
I haven't told her yet.
I kind of wanted to take care of this part first.
Rebecca, what you want to do is...
is admirable.
honey, it's really admirable.
but I have to tell you, the company is in a very precarious situation, and anything could happen...Anything.
I - I really don't want you to gamble away your future.
mom, this is Rebecca's money.
all right? She wants to help out Holly.
I'd do the same thing for you in a heartbeat.
I thought you'd be all over this.
well, I-I-I just wasn't expecting this.
it's out of the blue is all.
mom, what...What...What's the matter with you?
nothing is the matter. Nothing.
I'm...I'm crabby.
I'm...I'm fine.
sorry.
sorry. I,um...
of course. I will...I will, um...
I'll take care of it. Whatever you want.
so we've got about 50 members of the Burbank boosters club.
okay. - They're very receptive to your message about job creation.
Oh, if you're gonna talk about job creation, I might actually listen.
I'm just so proud to be working with you, Mrs. Walker-Mccallister.
well, thanks. You know, you can call me Kitty.
and...and you, too, Mr. Walker.
Oh, I'm not...I'm not working today.
I'm just carrying Kitty's water.
Oh, okay.
uh, that's a figure of speech, Brad.
Oh, okay.
but I actually am a little thirsty.
I only brought one.
that's okay. You know what? He's my brother.
so it's...It's okay.
Yeah, great.
so why don't you go ahead and introduce Kitty?
sure. Got it.
I don't know why you think your staff's not fun.
welcome to the Burbank boosters club.
now I'm very pleased to introduce our speaker for today...
the next United States senator from the state of California, Kitty Mccallister.
what the hell is that? - I don't know.
what do I do?
say something. - No, what do I...
just take control. Calm them.
uh, good morning.
america for Americans!
Frenchie go home!!!
america for Americans!
america for Americans!
america for Americans!
Sarah, you need to call me the minute you get this message.
somehow Robert and I got all tangled up in Luc's immigration problems, and it's turned into a huge mess.
so put on your clothes and call me, please.
meow. - Oh, I'm sorry.
I guess I get a little touchy when I'm accused of corruption.
have we figured out where this is coming from yet?
half the right-wing web sites have posted it without sourcing it.
Wow. Look at this."mac & cat pull strings for sister's boy-toy"!
they called me cat? - Yeah.
Oh, now I really hate them.
now you're sure that Sarah never asked you to reach out on Luc's behalf?
no, and I never offered.
what about you? - What? No, no.
the only thing I did was, I called, uh, Mario to see if he could look into it.
he's an immigration attorney at my old firm.
okay, you know what? Get him on the phone. I want to talk to him.
I already left a message. He hasn't called me back.
look at this. This one posted Luc's passport photo.
why the hell do you think they put him in a beard?
well, b-because...
because he's fidel castro's illegitimate son.
what? - Unbelievable.
they really have no shame.
this is anonymous character assassination, plus guilt by association.
Ah, it's just the conservative purity police trying to purge the party of lily-livered republican moderates.
Yeah, well, they're gonna have to decide, because I can't be lily-livered and Hitler all at the same time.
no, I'm lily-livered.
you are Hitler.
every web site is linked to every other web site and blog.
it just spreads exponentially.
Oh, my god.
Trudy's truths.
Trudy. Trudy what? T-r-u-d-y?
Yeah, she was an assistant at my old law firm.
she used to pray every night that I wouldn't be gay.
spends her weekends in the desert securing the Mexican border from alien invaders.
she must have started it on her blog.
she must have found out that I called Mario for advice and made the rest up.
I think these elites who don't believe in our constitution and don't love this country should follow the laws our soldiers fought and died for and stop taking jobs away from Americans.
Wow. She's good.
she had "elites," the constitution, love of country, dead soldiers, immigration and jobs all in one sentence.
I am so getting her fired.
don't, don't,'cause then we're, you know, accused of silencing trudy the truth teller.
we need to prepare a statement, because this is gonna spread to mainstream media.
you say "we."
you're looking at me.
well, yeah. I'm late for the motorcycle club.
and I have a flight to Sacramento in 20 minutes.
w- wait. W...I-I don't even work here anymore.
you know, this is Sarah's prob...
I shouldn't even be here, Kit.
Kevin, I need your help.
when Sarah needed a favor, you sure hopped to it.
Yeah, look how that turned out.
just write the statement. Please. Okay?
and I'll call you later.
Yes, mein fuhrer. - Not funny.
Holly. - Oh, hey, Nora.
Rebecca told me you were working here today.
I tried to call you. Why didn't you answer your phone? - Yeah, she told me.
thank you so much for facilitating all of this.
why did you tell her?
I lost my money months ago.
it's time that she knew...
no, I mean about the damn lake.
Oh, no, I didn't say one word about Dennis York.
I told you I wanted to keep the kids out of it, all of it.
well, I'm sorry.
I didn't think it would be any harm to tell her about Narrow Lake.
I mean, that's good news.
what possible harm could come from that?
Oh, Holly. You met Dennis.
do I really have to answer that question?
I didn't realize that you had an objection.
I apologize.
well, obviously, you're...
you're not going to accept Rebecca's money, are you?
well, yes, I am.
but I'm not gonna spend a penny of it until I'm sure she'll get it all back.
I can't believe you'd take your own child's money.
Nora, Rebecca and I have never had an easy relationship.
and how the hell does this help your relationship?
I gave her the money.
the only reason that you have it is, she was so mad at me at the time, that she refused to accept it.
this is not about $2 million.
this is about her accepting me again.
the only thing I don't understand is why you're so upset about it.
I - is that because you're trying to protect Justin's interest?
then you should know... - Oh, this isn't about Justin.
this has nothing to do with Justin. - Then what is it?
it's nothing. all right? It's nothing.
I'm sorry. It's...
whenever money's involved, things just...
get more complicated. That's all.
I'll talk to you later.
maybe we could take a little trip to New York in july.
Oh, I'll take you to New York.
I know all the best restaurants and art galleries.
you will love it. You'll love it.
God, you know, I haven't been for so long.
it sounds so good.
why are there so many people in front of your house?
Oh, god. I hope some celebutant hasn't moved onto my block.
excuse me. - Hey.
what's going on here?
you're Sarah Walker, right?
and you're Luc Laurent?
what's going on, man?
Luc, did you know Sarah was related to a senator when you started dating?
wait. Uh, this is about Kitty?
did you ask your sister to help you?
help me with what?
Hey, Sarah, how long have you known Luc?
forget it. Let's go. Get out.
did Kitty Mccallister tell you she could pull strings to get you a visa?
Sarah is Kitty's sister.
Luc, don't answer that.
why don't you want him to answer that?
okay, I don't know where you people got your information, but my sister did not use any influence to help Luc.
turn the camera off.
Sarah, how much older are you than Luc?
excuse me?
do you always date younger men?
okay, you guys are really starting to piss me off. - Forget it.
is it true he wouldn't marry you, so you had to go to your sister to keep him around?
shove that down your throat where it'll do some good.
Oh, that's nice!
is this what you douche bags do for a living or is harassing private citizens your idea of fun?
it is people like you that give this country a bad name.
thank you, Sarah. Have a great day.
be sure to stretch. - Go, cougar.
Tommy. - mom.
uh, you all right? - Yeah.
what's with the, uh, sudden trip?
Oh. I'm glad to see you.
I'll tell you all about it. - Okay.
Thanks.
so how are you?
how am I? Let's see.
well, I'm pretty much treading water right now.
I, uh, got a job at a grocery wholesaler a few weeks ago.
well, Tommy, that's wonderful.
Really?
back to the, uh, rose-colored glasses already?
what about Julia and Elizabeth? How's that?
Yeah, that's pretty much gone from bad to worse.
Julia will barely speak to me, and I'm getting less and less time with Elizabeth.
Yeah, I thought getting a job would help...
you know, show Julia that I've changed.
but...
no, it's not.
Tommy, maybe it's time for you to come home.
is that what this is about, getting me to come home?
what, mom? What...What...
what's going on?
I - I know you talk to Sarah all the time.
did she tell you someone tried to buy Ojal foods?
Yeah, Obstfeld something or other?
obstfeld group. Yeah, but that didn't happen.
no, but the Obstfeld group was a front.
it's Dennis York.
w- why?- I don't know.
why would he want to buy ojal? It's never been in worse shape.
Tommy, have you ever heard of a place called Narrow Lake?
no.
well, I've managed to talk Sarah down off the ledge because in addition to everything else, she wasn't aware he was a porn star.
he was a porn star?
no, of course he wasn't a porn star.
that's what they're saying.
Oh, my god. Thank god. Thank god he's not a porn star.
you know, I'm just...I'm still actually very surprised that...
that Miss Sarah la-di-da has not called me to apologize.
well, keep in mind, you know, it hasn't been a walk on the beach for her today either.
okay, here she comes. Just please...Just be nice.
Kitty's on the phone.
Oh, about time.
how are you holding up? - Uh, okay.
the kids called from Joe's.
Cooper thinks it's awesome.
but Paige wants to expire from embarrassment.
well, business as usual.
no, Kitty. I wouldn't say that.
Yeah, well, you should just be happy they're not drawing moustaches on your face.
I would prefer that than being called "the famous pasadena cougar."
and for the record, I'm not that much older than Luc.
maybe you should've thought of that, Sarah, when you decided to call the cameraman a douche bag.
I mean, what the hell were you thinking? - You know what?
had I known that I was about to be swarmed by paparazzi, kitty,
I might have been able to prepare a more appropriate response.
right, right. Because I have complete control over what the paparazzi does.
and besides, you know what I did? I did try to call you.
but you didn't answer your phone.
no, I was running at the time.
well, that is not my fault, is it?
no, Kitty, apparently nothing is your fault okay, you know what? There are so many people to hate in this.
let's not waste time and energy hating each other, please.
okay, okay.
you know what? Look, I-I totally agree.
here's the thing, Sarah...
the entire blogosphere is screaming for Luc's visa to be revoked until there's an investigation, and sooner or later, the state department is gonna have to give in to the pressure.
well, then fight them. Don't let them get away with it.
the best way to fight them is to hand it in voluntarily and prove to them that we have nothing to hide.
okay, I'm hanging up now.
no, no, no, s... - Look, just don't waste your breath, Kevin.
we're not gonna do it.
just tell her that I will drive down there, we will sit down...
Luc, Sarah and I...And we will discuss it.
okay, she's gonna come over so she could talk with you and Luc.
no, she can't come over here.
Luc is much nicer than I am, and I don't want him to cave.
you have to go somewhere else.
okay, fine. Mom's house, two hours.
but I'm calling the nanny, so Sarah better be there.
mom's, two hours?
okay. - Yeah, okay.
but I'm not coming with. - Oh, damn straight you are.
Yes, you are.
Wh...Haven't I suffered enough?
no. - no.
so, uh, where'd you see him?
at his hotel.
he wants Ojal, Tommy.
he demanded that we sell it to him.
York is not the type to make idle threats.
I mean, I-i'd hate to think what kind of...
what kind of dirt he has on Dad.
I just can't stand any more of William's scandals.
I want it to go away. I want William to stay buried.
mom...
why'd you come here?
I can convince all the kids to sell except Sarah.
you know what Ojal means to her.
the two of you grew up in that company working for your father.
I'm afraid to even talk to her about it, Tommy.
I need you to convince sarah to sell.
mom, I'm up here getting my life together.
and you're...You're dragging me back into this?
I don't ask you this lightly.
I swear, I don't ask you this lightly.
I have no one else to turn to.
Holly just wants the money she thinks that's there.
it's not her family that's at risk, Tommy.
it's ours.
look, you want me to sell my Ojal shares? Fine. I'll do it.
but I am not going down there.
ojal foods is ground zero for everything that went wrong in my life.
I'm sorry. I can't.
Hey, where's mom?
good question. - Why is it so cold in here?
because the thermostat was turned down to 10.
nobody knows where mom is.
she's not answering her cell phone.
I'm a little worried.
well, I'm sure she hasn't been kidnapped unless the guy's really eco-conscious.
okay, I'm telling you, I was here earlier, and she's like, "nothing's wrong," but something is definitely wrong.
so I'm gonna stay here until she gets back.
you might want to reconsider that.
there is gonna be some unpleasantness coming through that door any minute now.
what do you mean, unpleasantness?
Where's mom?
she's not here. - She's not here.
it's cold in here.
Sarah, look, I - I just want to say, I'm really sorry for what you and Luc are going through.
Thanks, Justin.
but can I ask you a question? - What's that?
is Luc trying to get citizenship so he can buy the lakers?
no. - Okay. Yeah. Is he ambidextrous?
no, Justin. - Okay.
well, then this last thing...He probably never worked in a french brothel.
this is character assassination.
Where's mom? - She's not here.
it's freezing in here. - Yeah.
look at this. There's a free Luc Laurent web page.
you can buy, like, free Luc t - shirts, free Luc coffee mugs.
Justin, are you...
Yeah, and for the record, he's not going to jail, okay?
no, it means "free him from the claws of the oversexed housewife.
I guess that's me.
okay, Kitty, would you please apologize to Sarah?
Why? That's not my web site.
I know. Just do it.
okay. Okay, fine.
Sarah, I am very sorry that because of my campaign, you got sucked up into this political firestorm, and you have had to pay a personal price through almost no fault of your own.
that's your apology?
you're unbelievable.
unbelievable? Where the hell is my apology?
I am fighting for my political life with a bunch of ultraconservative yahoos who want my head because you decided to fall in love with a guy who has immigration issues, and apparently, you never learned how to say "no comment.
what... - Okay, Sarah, please just apologize to Kitty so we can move on.
no.
I don't even know why I'm here.
I'm sorry that Kitty has political problems, but they're not mine to solve.
of course not.
she did just say she was sorry.
did not. - Technically, I heard "sorry.
all right? Well, I didn't mean it.
I didn't mean it either.
you know who deserves an apology here?
me.
there are two things...No, I have said I want no part...
Oh, Kevin, seriously, this is not about you. -Oh, my god. Honest to god.
I have made it clear I want no part of two things...
law and politics...
both of which I've been doing all day...For the two of you.
have I heard a word of thanks? - Blah, blah, blah, blah.
Luc, Luc, speaking of apologies, he's the one taking the most hits here.
Yes, a poor innocent caught up in this insanity.
I'm so sorry.
I need to talk to you.
Hey, Luc, don't listen to all this stupid... - Yeah.
internet chatter and stuff. It's stupid.
is everything okay? - Yeah, um, I'm sorry.
but about this one thing, it's, uh, it's true.
Oh, please, god. Let him be ambidextrous.
I'm sorry, Kitty. It's true about the Maison De Joie...
uh, whorehouse.
well, a-after my father lost his job, my parents started to have problems.
so one day they say to me that it's a good idea for a boy to experience the city.
so they sent you to a whorehouse?
well, no.
they sent me to my uncle tony in marseilles.
they thought tony was an hotelier and he owned his own hotel.
well, I guess they weren't that far off.
I never lived in the...
whorehouse. - No.
I-I, um, I just ran errands for people.
I'd bring cigarettes and wine, swept the floor and washed dishes.
I'm sorry, Sarah. I didn't know that it would ever matter to anyone.
no, come on. I'm sorry.
Luc, none of this is your fault.
and as much as I would like to blame Kitty...
it's not her fault either.
now she's furious at me.
Kevin's furious at me.
this whole thing is such a disaster.
I don't know what to do.
see, none of this would've ever happened if it weren't for me.
I cannot let this go on any longer.
I have to make it right.
no, is this what you do for a living...
your idea of fun?
you should turn that off, cause it's gonna make you crazy.
Yeah, well, did you hear the latest bombshell? About the brothel?
Oh, my god. You already know about it?
is it true? - Apparently.
I mean, it's not as bad as it sounds, but...
but I'm telling you, Sarah is completely freaking out.
you better call her. - I know.
I know I should, but I don't know what to say.
I mean, you know we can't control this crap that they put on the internet.
and if we do some big sort of denial, it'll just cross over into the mainstream media.
well, it's already crossed over to the mainstream media.
the networks are calling for an interview.
and I've just been told that Luc's visa has been revoked.
great. Great. Of course. Of course.
and he's only got three weeks left, so he's right back where he started, and I...
you know, what...What...
what do you think we should do?
we could schedule on-camera interviews tomorrow for both of us.
tell the truth, defend the family, demand Luc's visa be reinstated and talk about what you believe in and hope that another scandal comes along and makes people forget about it.
I love you.
you think they'll believe us?
I don't know. I mean, they've done a good job of spinning it even though we have the truth on our side.
it's Kevin.
Hi, Kevin.
no, you're kidding me.
well, no, no. I'm on my way.
I'll...I'll...I...I will meet you there.
I will meet you there.
Wh... - I gotta go.
well, where you going? - L. a.x. I gotta go.
okay.
okay, hit it really hard. One, two, three.
there it goes, right through the middle.
Whoa! Almost. - Oh, my goodness. Let's see where it went.
Hey, mom, coffee.
where is it?
here!
is it there? There it is!
Oh, my goodness. You have to hit it in that hole now.
okay.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
move it where you want it.
Oh, god, Tommy, she's so adorable.
and she's so smart...
so smart. - I know. I feel so lucky.
you know what the hardest part is?
it's feeling like she...
like she deserves more.
Oh, tommy, stop it.
to her, you're perfect.
you are her one and only perfect daddy.
and then she'll hit adolescence and discover all your flaws.
Yeah. In dad's case, the flaws just keep on coming, don't they?
Yeah.
he was a whole lot less than we all deserved.
you know, the hardest thing about letting go is...
letting go of him...
the hope that...
he was the father that I wanted him to be.
you know, we've all been telling ourselves this story, this big fairy tale, that the wonderful business that William built somehow made up for all the pain he caused, that...
that the very best part of William was his damn company.
it's not true.
the very best part of William's you...
all of his children. And I don't want you to suffer anymore.
I don't want the sins of the father to haunt you anymore, Tommy.
if I...
come down...
help convince the others to sell the company, is that...
is that the end of it?
Yes, short of burning it to the ground.
okay.
I guess it's time for me to come home.
thank you.
there's everything but the fog.
why would there be fog?
in the movie,"casablanca," there's fog when they said good-bye.
looks like we're in our own movie.
Oh, my god. He's actually filming us.
look, just ignore him.
wonder how they'll twist this around. They'll probably say you're dumping me.
just don't look at him. Just look at me.
it's time, Sarah. I gotta go.
I know. I know.
I gotta go through security.
you gonna be okay here?
as long as you don't say,"here's looking at you, kid."
I love you. - I love you, too.
okay, go.
thank god I caught you.
kit, they're in here. - Kevin, I'm sorry. I have to go.
sit down. You're not going anywhere.
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god.
I...I can't believe I found you.
do you know how many bars there are in this airport?
what are you doing here, Kitty?
Oh, Sarah.
I c...I could never let you guys do this.
Oh, Kitty. - Oh, Sarah.
I'm so sorry. - No, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. - No, I'm sorry.
I never should've let these crazy people walk all over us...
I should've just kept my mouth shut.
no, you shouldn't have, and that's all...
girls, just get on with it.
please.
right. Right. Listen, Luc.
I - I don't want you to leave.
you have three more weeks on your old visa, and I think that we should totally fight this.
I - I'm sorry, Kitty, but I think I've caused enough damage.
I I... - Listen, Kitty, I don't think I'm up for the fight.
these...these people, they're relentless.
and then there's a zillion crazies out there making up all kinds of lies.
Kevin. - Yeah.
get me the douche bag.
okay, those are four words I never want to hear from my sister.
Kevin. - What?
just...just go. Get him. - Okay. Fine, fine.
Kitty, what are you doing?
well, you know what? They hijacked our story, and we're gonna reclaim it, even if it's just for us.
so what, you're gonna tell that guy?
Yeah, why not? Why not?
I might be one voice in the cyber wilderness, but better one than nothing.
he made me promise you wouldn't break his camera.
I'll try to control myself.
Oh, give me a break. This isn't fun for me.
okay, let's roll it.
Hi, I'm Kitty Walker-Mccallister.
and, uh, and...And this, this is Sarah Walker.
and she is a professional businesswoman, taxpayer, soccer mom and my sister.
a - and this, this is Luc...Luc Laurent.
and, yes, he is a french citizen and an artist who takes no jobs from americans.
he loves Sarah and Sarah loves him.
that was a big scene at the airport today.
you saw it?
it's popping up everywhere. I think you're about to go viral.
you might want to rephrase that. - Oh, right.
that didn't come out like I wanted it to.
so how are you?
how's life?
I didn't want to wake you when I came in last night, and all hell broke loose this morning.
I feel like I haven't seen you in two days.
well, remember that, uh, meeting that I had with my boss the other day?
Yeah.
uh, he closed the restaurant...
for good. We're out of business. So that's how I am.
Oh, no.
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?
Yeah. I mean, timing could not suck more, but I'm okay.
can I offer you some advice based on the last two days?
don't answer the phone.
no, I'm actually being serious.
I swore up and down I was through with politics and lawyering, and I've done nothing but for the past two days.
but I'm glad I did, because I'm good at it.
and I wasn't working for anyone else.
I was doing it for me and for my family, for love.
it's time for you to open your own restaurant.
Oh, Kevin, that's a lovely thought.
but collectively, we're jobless, we spent the majority of our savings trying to make a baby...
I know it'll be hard, but we'll figure out a way to make it work.
it's time for you to start dreaming big and do what you want to do.
and you're ready for it.
and you know I'm right.
Kevin, look at you.
you're making moves in the background for everybody else.
you need to start doing what you love.
I just need to figure out exactly what that is first.
well, take your time.
I can pick up some catering shifts to tide us over.
wait. Did you watch all of it?
uh, no, not yet.
Oh, well, then you haven't seen the best part.
now see, we come from a very close-knit family.
and we all look out for one another.
and...and over the last few days,
I have had to watch Sarah and Luc suffer because I happen to be running in a very noxious political climate.
and hey, listen. I'm sorry. Could I just interrupt?
sure.
Kitty never, ever intervened on Luc's behalf.
no. - And if...
you can just look at my platform to see that I actually believe in legal immigration.
I mean, in fact, I believe in increasing our border control.
which I disagree with, actually.
well, yes, of course you do, because my sister is a flaming liberal.
Ugh, but if you heard her views on amnesty...
I mean, they're crazy.
uh, uh, sarah. - Not crazy. But very, very...
conservative. - Conservative, yes.
I'm a conservative. I know who I am.
so if you are looking for a person who believes in all that claptrap...
Claptrap? - that is not...This is your woman.
uh, you know what? You know what?
uh, let me interrupt here for a second.
you see, this right here is what's so great about our family.
we can despise each other's political opinions, but we don't despise each other.
Aw, that's right. That's right.
and that is the spirit that I want to take to Washington.
you see, if I ever get to the point where my ideology is so rigid that I can't see another point of view or if my loyalty lies with my party instead of my country, well, then I want the voters to send me home.
and a couple of more things.
she loves to be called cat, so please do that as often as possible, and she's also very generous.
so, ladies and gentlemen, please step up to the bar, because drinks and food are on her tab.
Thanks, Cat.
mum. It's Tommy I've been an accident I'm so sorry I'm sorry mum -mum -yes are u ok?
no, I am just got that's all are u sure u are right for this?
we can just pretent it's no no no tommy where are u?
Hey, Sol - Tommy long time no see l you too.
so tell me, what is this all about?
I have no idea, but it should be interesting.
Hey.
surprise. look who's here.
Yeah, I'm the, uh, mystery guest.
Oh, god. It's good to see you.
Yeah, you, too. I love the hair.
well, thanks.
Thanks. It's my own.
Tommy!
Hey. how are ya?
Hey. oh, my god.
you look so good.
okay, what does everyone want to eat?
Thai? Chinese? Indian?
wait. WAIT A MINUTE.
you're ordering takeout?
Oh, hey, bro. how are ya?
guys. I'm good. How are you?
good, you know?
Oh, LOOK AT YOU.
you look great.
so, um, what's--what's going on?
well, uh, Tommy's here, mom's ordering takeout, uh, so welcome to bizarro world.
I haven't had time to cook anything.
see? I knew she went somewhere.
shut UP.
look, Tommy had a few days off.
I-I just flew up to see him.
I told her, next time she goes away, you have to tell someone.
Yeah, the only reason why we didn't think you were abducted was because the thermostat was turned down.
okay, TOMMY, What's the occasion?
are you engaged?
Oh, LET ME GUESS-- You've been arrested again? YOU MET SOMEONE?
you did? you did? - You met someone?
no, no, no, no. What's with the 20 questions?
just STOP, OKAY?
he's here for a visit.
let's not harass him.
well, maybe if you told us why he was here, mom, instead of calling the mysterious .
Oh, I swear this family has more meetings than the mob.
I'm gonna tell you everything, but let's decide what we wanna order first.
uh, THAI.
Thai, YEAH.
Thai, Thai, Thai, Thai, Thai.
so talk.
so as I think you all know, a company called obstfeld tried to buy holly's shares of ojai foods.
but holly refused to sell them, right?
that--that's right.
she didn't sell.
now they've come to us with an incredible offer .
and I was thinking-- it's- -oh, whoa.
you're seriously considering this?
Sarah, I know what ojai means to you, what it really means to this whole family.
but it's also been an albatross around our necks-- the financial difficulties, the family disputes.
well, we've worked through those.
I'm just thinking that maybe we don't need this baggage anymore.
you all have your own lives.
maybe it's time.
cash in, move on.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'm hearing this.
a month ago, you were telling me that ojai was practically our family religion.
they're offering us a lot of money.
so that's why you came down here, to help mom lobby us to sell our shares?
and you, too, saul?
Sarah, honey, listen to me.
you've always had to be the breadwinner.
but this--this would take the pressure off of you.
you could enjoy your kids and luc.
and do what, mom, BECOME A '50s HOUSEWIFE?
this is my career.
you wouldn't have to juggle so much.
I like to juggle.
wait a second. Is this about narrow lake?
what's narrow lake?
nothing.
that's not what holly says.
Holly says this is a piece of property that's worth a lot of money, that apparently, ojai owns.
okay, how do I not know about this?
because it's nothing.
well, obviously, it's not nothing, mom, if even justin knows about it.
Holly has been looking .
what?
and there's nothing there. Nothing.
but this offer is real.
I'm telling you, it's real.
Justin, you're in med school.
it's gonna be years before you can earn a living.
mm, thanks, mom.
Kevin, you want to be a father.
you've already spent a fortune, you don't even have the baby yet.
do you have any idea how much it ?
guys, this is a great offer.
Oh, my god.
mom, please stop spinning.
I mean, I'm a pundit.
I can smell spin a mile away.
I'm not spinning. I mean this.
But?
but nothing.
Nora, you're not telling them everything.
okay, THE ONLY THING I haven't told you is that obstfeld, the company, is owned by a guy named dennis york. that's all.
who's that?
he used to work for dad. - YEAH.
that's like calling a whore a date.
Oh, this guy was paid under the table to do god knows what.
Sarah, you're making him sound like he was a hit man.
Dennis YORK WAS A problem solver, okay?
if there were any union problems, for example, your father would call him, and--and they would be resolved.
so does this guy have anything on dad?
wait a minute, mom. Is he trying to blackmail you?
No!
guys, I think you should just talk to holly about narrow lake.
is this another way of covering something dad did?
well, WHAT DID DAD DO?
I have put the last five years of my life into ojai- - yeah, but, sarah, - if there are bodies buried somewhere, I think it's t- - it's not about your campaign, kitty.
Oh, I never said it was about my campaign, sarah-- - S-STOP!
th-this is just an incredible opportunity for you guys, and that's why I brought it to you, so you could all have everything you want out of your lives.
look, this is the kind of opportunity that makes owning a family business worthwhile.
I'm sorry if I--if I--if I shocked you.
that's why I thought we should order some food first.
mom, I don't think food would have made this go down any easier.
well, then don't eat anything.
just don't eat anything.
you were absolutely right.
Bizarro.
I don't understand how your mom could completely dismiss the possibility of narrow lake.
because I was the one who said it.
I-I mean, when It comes to ojai, I don't count.
and it started with my dad.
he never wanted me around that place.
I'm just not a part of it.
it's where I work, and it's my mom's company, and I just gave her all of that money to invest in it.
Rebecca, she was just throwing pit out there, all right?
it doesn't mean I'm gonna do it.
Yeah, you say that now, tbut you know your mom. She's gonna pressure you into it.
we're gonna be caught in the middle again.
no, we won't.
Prebecca, you come first.
you're what's important to me, not ojai.
so whatever you want me to do, I'll do.
I don't want you to sell.
then I won't.
and all this family stuff-- I mean, we've been through too much to let it matter.
I choose you.
I choose you, too.
come here.
I feel like we just won the lottery.
well, we don't know what the offer is yet.
and I'm not even sure we should take it.
do the words "gift horse" rmean anything to you?
look, Scotty, ojai's our family business, okay?
it's always been there.
it's a like safety net, and I want that for our kids.
what kids?
Kevin, right now we have two frozen blasts and a lot of debt.
we're SUPPOSED TO BE Positive, remember?
okay, I'm so positive.
RI'm reading "the secret," and I'm putting good vibes into the universe.
but this is our last chance.
you know, if monday's transfer doesn't work, that's it.
w-we're done.
$100, 000 Down the tubes.
that's your version pof staying positive?
I just want us to have kids so badly.
and if this doesn't take, we're gonna have to pay for a whole other round -- look, I would love pthe cash, okay, but I'm not gonna sign anything until I know the facts.
and, you know, there's something wrong here.
why would your mother vtry to cover it up?
I mean, you guys all know he wasn't exactly the most upstanding businessman, and, you know, besides, he's dead.
what if this is about Tommy?
I'm serious.
what if he convinced mom to sell the company so he could pay off his debts?
not everything's Tommy's fault.
I'm just not gonna be comfortable until we know the truth.
all right.
to a good transfer.
and an easy thaw.
Ooh, I'M GONNA GET Your little feet.
do you wanna play peekaboo?
where is evan?
Hey. - Peekaboo.
Hey. - HOW WAS DINNER?
Oh, you have no idea.
I was so deluded growing up.
I thought my father was the best father in the whole entire world.
now I have no idea what he did, but I know that it was really bad, because when I tell you that my mother is spinning like a top
did you tell 'em tabout your appointment?
honey, you were gonna tell them about your first-look appointment with Dr. Avadon.
Yes, I just-I didn't pget a chance. Tommy was there.
and then my mother drops this bombshell, and she wants everybody to sell their ojai shares.
okay, look, I am not interested in ojai right now.
I'm just thinking about you and this appointment and that you're gonna be great.
Yeah.
and evan thinks so, too.
Yeah.
poor little guy.
he is so high on, uh, children's ibuprofen and teething gel, that--that he doesn't know what's going on. do you, baby?
Mm. no.
he just knows he loves you.
I don't know, you know,
this is what cancer survivors do.
you know, you go through your rounds of chemo, you get a clean bill of health, and then you go back for a checkup.
you know, it's like-- it's like going to the dentist. It doesn't mean that you have a cavity.
exactly.
and I'm, uh, I'm gonna sell my shares.
my-- my mother wants that, and i, - you know, I think she's in some kind of trouble, so- - hey, look, whatever's right.
Yeah.
Sarah. - Justin, what are you doing up?
why is mama yelling?
Oh, mommy isn't yelling.
mama's just talkin' really loudly.
let's go upstairs and get you back in bed.
Oh, hey. it's me.
are you doing anything?
I couldn't hear what they were saying, but mom was in the yard with dennis and dad.
and--and then she was yelling.
she was angry.
I've never seen her so angry.
I wish I knew what it was, but I don't.
okay, but how is mom involved in this?
I don't know.
I swear to god, I don't know.
but whatever it is, it freaked out mom so much, she hopped a plane to seattle.
Sarah, I don't know about you, but I don't want to start digging up old bones.
so what, we just sell ojai?
look, I know that you think saving the company is saving the family, but the family will be fine without it, probably better off.
you need to focus on your life, Sarah.
if mom is right,
Hello, Nora.
they're not biting.
so what's the game plan?
I brought Tommy down.
I just need more time.
you have until next week.
next week?
I'm losing patience.
I've already wasted enough time trying to buy holly's shares.
Oh, Dennis, you know what?
I never trusted you.
I used to say to William,"there's something off with that " you know, I'm getting a little sick of this.
you insist on making me into this monster, and we both know I was just following orders-- William's and yours.
here.
proof-- copies of canceled checks.
your signature's on every one.
there's nothing illegal about what we did.
I know.
but it's hardly what your children expect from you.
get your kids to sign on the dotted line, or I swear to god, Nora, I'm gonna destroy your family.
I have no choice.
so you're actually considering selling your shares? - I don't know, Holly.
I mean, if my family can make a lot of money on this now, and I don't have to deal with the crap my father left me
it's not your father's business any longer. It's ours.
well, maybe I'm just not up for the challenge anymore.
if it's not the economy, it's some scandal or--or secret that gets dredged up from the past, like this narrow lake.
what's with that? Why didn't you come to me?
because your mother asked me not to.
you did she do that? she's convinced there's nothing there.
nothing there?
I found a geological survey that your father did in '73 on this piece of property called narrow lake.
a month ago, dennis york filed a "doing business as" under the same name.
he did?
obviously, this is complicated for you. You've got a lot of family issues to consider.
but bottom line-- this is business.
and you and I have been working our asses off to save this place.
and God knows I need the money more than anyone.
my--my personal assets have been wiped out.
but God, Sarah, look around. Look at this place.
it's incredible.
and we could make this a great business again.
I mean, we have come this far.
what are you gonna do, huh, just give up?
well, I wouldn't be giving it up.
I'd--I'd be moving on.
as long as you can live with that.
Hey.
Hi, honey.
thank you for stopping by.
I-I wanted to talk to you after last night.
uh, me, too.
Sarah, i-i want you to know that this is--this is completely your decision.
Oh, good.
I'm glad that you think so.
and I'm sorry how I acted last night.
this isn't easy for anyone.
I know how hard it would be for you to walk away.
because I thought I-I really did, and I talked to Tommy.
I know. He told me.
what he said made a lot of sense, but then I just talked to holly.
well, she is my business partner, mom.
well, I know she is, sweetheart, but holly has her own agenda, and I think maybe she would manipulate you in such a way to service that agenda-- that stupid narrow lake thing.
Yeah, but it's not--it's not really stupid, is it, mom?
there's some pretty compelling evidence .
Hey. - HELLO.
Hey.
Oh, are we talking about ojai? - Yeah.
evidently, our friend Holly is trying to convince your sister not to sell.
I actually thought it through myself, very carefully.
I've just realized that I can't sell ojai until it's back to what it was.
otherwise it's gonna feel like an enormous failure.
is this about your pride now?
what am I supposed to say in a job interview, mom?
but this is a family business, honey.
it's a family business.
everybody has a vote.
what about you, kitty?
you're being uncharacteristically quiet here.
Yeah, come on, Kitty.
my career is on the line.
no, sarah. that's not fair.
please just let Kitty make her own decisions.
okay, i-i think, you know, coming from somebody who is less emotionally entangled in- - I'm not emotionally entangled, Kitty.
I'm co-president.
okay, Sarah, all I am saying is that- that you're on mom's side.
no, I'm not taking anybody's side, Sarah. It's not about sides.
well, I'm not selling, and I'm gonna make damn sure that nobody else can either.
Kitty, you're not selling.
stop it!
God, Sarah, stop it.
don't bully your sister.
God, when is the last time i ever asked you for anything? - Never and I'm always there for you, whatever you want.
if you need me to babysit or carpool your kids of make you a dinner or be a shoulder for you to cry on, I'm there.
Oh, so that's it?
the bill's due now?
instead of 13 bucks an hour, you want my career?
this isn't a career. It's a job. it's a job.
and I don't care what you say.
you're smart. you're talented.
you could get a job anywhere.
do you think I would ask you to do something like this if I didn't need to?
my god, Sarah, I'm always there for you.
I come through for you every time, no questions asked.
and just this once, this one time, why can't you do the same for me?
mom.
mom.
get in the car, Tommy.
I said get in the car.
they, uh, they both just left.
they seem pretty upset.
Tommy, Sarah's not gonna do it.
Sarah's not gonna do it.
what is going on?
if this were just about dad, you wouldn't be doing all this stuff.
look, you brought me down here, mom. what?
what is it?
I met with York again last night.
he gave me these.
I know your father told you everything was all right.
Oh, my god.
but it wasn't all right.
have you been paying off the family?
Yes.
no.
mom, what, a-and you lied to me? for 25 years, you lied.
He--he's hurt?
how bad?
mom? how bad?
he was paralyzed.
he was paralyzed.
Oh, god.
Oh, god.
it was an accident, Tommy.
your father made a deal with the family.
he sent them money every month,
I continued to do it.
no.
it WAS A very long time ago.
you were all just kids.
I thought we were doing the right thing.
what do you mean, she flipped out?
okay, there are two kinds of flip outs, right?
there's the "oh, my god. You all aren't coming over " flip out , and then there's the "oh, my god. My husband has been cheating on me for the entire duration of my marriage" flip out.
and it was definitely the latter.
and all I said was that I didn't want to sell the company.
Yeah, and it's not even like I agreed with you.
Yeah, you made your feelings about that pretty clear, Kitty.
I don't think we should do anything until we know exactly what's going on.
thank you.
what happens if dad actually did something really bad?
what if it's tommy?
he's already broken the law. That we know of.
look, this is probably nothing, but I keep-- I keep going back to this memory I had.
mom's yelling at york in the backyard.
Oh, MY GOD. I remember that.
it was the night that you got me drunk.
I got you drunk?
Yes, you did.
you got me drunk.
Sarah, don't you remember?
Sarah - What, Kitty?
I'm right here.
Oh, hi.
who is mom yelling at now?
it's, uh, dad and this guy dennis.
did he throw up on mom's sofa, too?
Oh. HERE.
this will help settle your stomach.
okay. thanks.
Oh, Justin. What are you doing up?
why is mama yelling?
Oh, mommy's not yelling.
that WAS THE NIGHT That I vowed I would never drink again.
that lasted. - YEAH.
well, at least I don't drink wine coolers anymore.
what was mom yelling about?
I DON'T KNOW. I couldn't hear through the window.
wait a minute. That was the night that you had that big party at ojai.
Oh, my god. I did.
Yeah.
was that when I was dating patrick shuman?
no. NO, YOU Definitely weren't dating him.
but he--he was there.
I never got invited to anything.
Oh, no, you were there.
you turned up with tommy and crashed my party.
we DO, PATRICK.
we lose nicaragua, there goes central america.
next thing you know, we got the soviets positioning missiles in our backyard.
OK Kitty. he gets enough poli-sci lectures in school.
I rarely meet other republicans.
you're a republican?
I told you I wasn't the only one.
here, Kitty.
Oh, I don't really drink.
Oh, stop being such a geek.
Oh, look what just walked in.
Hey, Sarah. Kit.
what are you doing here?
Oh, he's showing off his new car.
Ah, you're just jealous.
Where's the keg?
Tommy, this is a college party.
Kitty's not in college.
Yeah, but she's a girl.
at any party with college guys, high school girls are invited.
,which is basically college.
well, this is basically where I work.
so as a responsible employee, I might have to call dad, tell him his oldest daughter is throwing a kegger at his office.
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
did you bring kevin?
Oh, hi, Sarah.
I love this song... ?
what are you doing here?
I brought him.
Oh, cool. Thanks a lot.
I thought high school girls were always allowed.
Yeah, his I. Q. is very low.
it's hard for him to distinguish genders.
this is, uh, this is aaron.
he's from sharon.
Hey.
Oh, my god. that rhymes.
I'm just down here for the weekend.
there's a state swim meet.
he's one of the best divers in cali.
what did kitty do to her hair?
I love it!
remember that boy that you brought?
who, aaron? - Yeah.
Yeah, well, I used to see him at swim meets.
he lived up north.
Yeah, you were totally into him, weren't you?
wouldn't HAVE MATTERED. I wasn't out then.
Oh, you never fooled around?
not even a little bit?
actually, we had a fight that night.
what about?
I don't remember.
that was 25 years ago.
we were drinking wine coolers.
well, I thought he was very cute.
you thought everyone was cute that night, didn't you?
Oh, I did not.
I'm just gonna ask you this one time, Kitty.
did you sleep with Patrick Shuman?
no, I didn't-'cause you know he was my boyfriend.
no, Sarah, I did no t sleep with Patrick.
I saw you making out. - I was a virgin, and you never told me he was your boyfriend.
I bet the only reason you didn't was because the party busted up.
wait. what--what happened?
did the police come? - No.
it was Tommy.
Hey! hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
no body parts on the copier.
your brother's on the phone.
hello. you what?
are you okay?
why did you do that?
okay. OKAY, OKAY.
what happened?
uh, Tommy's been in an accident.
he's on his way to the hospital.
Oh, was he hurt badly?
I don't know. He's with the paramedics.
but he told dad that we're hanging out here.
we have to clean up this party right now. Dad's on the way.
he totaled his brand-new car and he ruined the party.
it's so Tommy.
Oh, my god.
what?
I remember this now.
okay, don't freak out. - What?
he wasn't the only one in the car.
where are you going?
to get more beer.
Tommy, you're drunk.
I had two drinks.
and the liquor store is, like, three blocks away.
that's what the kids in the film at school always say just before they drive into a semi.
you are such a pain.
you're like an ad for m. a.d. d.
see? Tommy, you're drunk.
you're rhyming and you don't even realize it.
look, you need to stop worrying about me, Kevin, and start worrying about yourself.
okay? I mean, look at you.
you have no friends.
and the only reason aaron's hanging out with you is because he's from a different high school.
he's from a different city.
I'm sorry.
I'll pick you up some grape hubba bubba . Hey, I told you I'd take you to see "platoon" this weekend, and I will.
um, I'd--i'd rather see "top gun" again.
okay.
top gun" it is?
and Tommy was drunk? You're sure?
Yeah, I'm absolutely sure.
well, who was the other kid in the car?
I don't know. Tommy had tons of friends.
okay, l-listen, let's just step back from the edge here for a second.
are we honestly thinking that Tommy -- Oh, god. it's him.
what do we do?
uh, we just act casual.
Hey, Kev. Scotty said you'd be here.
actually, we were just talking about you.
Yeah.
just, you know, old times.
reminiscing.
actually, Tommy,
we figured out, that--that memory I told you about, with mom yelling?
turns out that that was the same night that I threw the party at ojai.
what party?
you, um, you had just gotten your first car.
so? that was 25 years ago.
who cares?
well, if I remember, you actually totaled that car that night.
I can't believe this.
Tommy, WE'RE JUST Trying to figure out this whole York thing.
you think I did something, don't you?
there was another kid in the car with you that night, right?
do not blame me for this.
Oh, Tommy. Nobody's trying to blame you.
we're really--we're just trying to figure it out.
just drop it. okay?
Tommy- - what? I'm outta here.
I'm not talking about this, Kevin.
who was in the car?
did you hurt him?
Oh, unbelievable. Is mom covering for you?
is that what this is all about?
york's found out, now mom's covering for you?
why is it the first thing you want to do is blame me?
I'm trying to help you, but I can't do that unless I know the truth.
Oh, you think you have the whole thing figured out, don't you, Kevin?
Tommy, I was there--I-I begged you not to get in that car.
please, just please, let me help you.
you're on your own.
you always run away from your problems.
you know what? You can't do it forever.
one day, you're gonna have to face yourself and you'll be alone when you do.
are you looking for the kappa house or are you just gonna go ahead and roll on into first period?
how's Evan?
he's with mary at the park.
What--what happened last night?
Oh, my god, Robert. It's so bad.
Tommy apparently was in a car accident when he was, like, 16 years old, and we think that he hurt .
we're starting to think that that's what York has on mom.
and--and now saul has called us back to the house for this--this big- - kitty, kitty, listen, I know about the accident.
what?
I know about the accident like I know that Kevin was late on his '02 taxes and that Sarah had a housekeeper for a summer that wasn't a citizen.
Oh, my god. of course.
you ran for president, so- - yeah, I mean, they vetted my seventh grade math teacher.
okay.
so tell me what you know.
I'm SORRY TO HAVE YOU All come over here again.
well, it's not like we've been thinking about much else.
um, I have to meet scotty soon, so can you say what you want to say?
I know it's hard, what your mother's asking us to do.
I've been at ojai longer than any of you.
so you want to sell?
Sarah, please let him finish.
well, it doesn't make sense, mom.
it makes all the sense in the world, Kevin.
Why?
all I need to know is that she wants to do it.
I don't give a damn why.
your father was involved in a lot of things.
and if she wants to clear his name, whatever is left of it, why won't you let her?
I don't think it's his name she's trying to save.
mom, I LOVE YOU MORE Than anything in the world, but you gotta tell us what the hell is going on.
Yeah. - Mom, Sarah's right.
it's over, Mom.
I can't keep doing this.
you--you--you have to tell him the truth.
I'm--I'm sorry. "him"?
who do you have to tell the truth to?
it's Kitty. Yeah.
robert knows all about Tommy's accident.
it was nothing.
nobody was seriously hurt.
what are you talking about?
well, our whole family was investigated when Robert ran for president, and the kid Who was in the car with Tommy, he's a teacher up in santa cruz now.
Tommy wasn't the one who did anything.
Hello?
it wasn't Tommy that hurt a boy that night, was it?
no.
where did everybody go？
I don't know, but it looks like they left in a hurry.
Yeah, it must have happened fast,'cause we weren't in the warehouse that long.
Yeah, we kinda were.
Oh, god.
look, I'm so sorry.
I mean, I probably didn't have to show you how they package every kind of produce.
no, it was cool.
you know, what--what--what about a ride home?
how--how are we gonna get there?
I don't know, but I'm not in any rush.
and hey, we even got refreshments.
Yeah.
it's nice out here.
Yeah.
did I hear something?
I think everybody left.
it's okay.
I didn't hear a thing.
what the hell was that oh, god. What'd I do?
Kevin! get in the car.
dad...
I, uh- - get in the car now!
I didn't--didn't mean to.
I didn't mean to.
I'm sorry.
Hey, Kev.
I thought you might be here.
Why?
I asked you a question.
how'd you know I was here?
just go talk to Mom.
this is about Aaron, isn't it?
look, let me just take you home, you can talk to Mom- - no, because you're here and you know something.
there was a fight, right?
Yeah, and dad told me he was fine.
so why don't you tell me what happened?
look, all I know is, after my accident, I called Mom.
dad picked up the phone.
I told him we were at ojai hanging out.
I guess he must have come down here to see what was going on.
and then when I was .
let's go.
I saw Aaron.
he was on a-a gurney.
they were rushing him in.
and Dennis york was there, too.
Tommy, if you know what happened to aaron, you have to tell me now.
he was paralyzed.
Oh, my god. I'm sorry.
you--you knew all this time?
no, no, no, no, no.
mom just told me.
I mean, that night, they-- they said he was fine.
I thought that was the truth.
Kevin, this is not your fault.
it's okay.
no, Tommy, this is not okay.
this is not okay.
God, he's not picking up.
I can't just stand here and do nothing.
I don't know what to say, Mom.
I wanted to protect him.
I thought of him differently than I thought of you.
hello.
Yeah.
I-I told him,Mom.
I had to.
okay.
what have I done?
it was an accident.
he was a swimmer.
did you know that?
you didn't mean to hurt him.
what did dad tell you he saw that night?
a fight.
just--just a fight.
teenage kids stupidly swinging at each other, and then Aaron stumbled off the platform.
that's all he saw, us fighting?
when he got home, he told me your friend had been hurt.
he'd fallen off the platform.
he--he didn't know how badly at first.
he told me he called york, and it was york that went with aaron to the hospital.
why did you tell me he was fine when he wasn't?
I-I wanted to protect you.
you were a sweet, insecure 14-year-old boy.
I w--I was afraid that it would destroy you and I- - I'm a 38-year-old man.
I know.
there was never a right time.
you were struggling to come out, and then law school- law school?
when was the right time for me to tell you?
and the longer I waited, the harder it got.
did dad pay them off?
Yes.
but the family agreed.
no one was pressured- - I didn't know, Mom!
I DIDN'T KNOW.
I know.
I know.
I wanted to protect you.
I thought that's what parents were supposed to do.
I don't need protecting.
everything you've said, it's all about you-- what you wanted to do, how you felt, how you were gonna protect me.
you were only protecting yourself.
do not follow me!
okay.
okay.
come ON, TOMMY. Let me sign your cast.
she's
I don't care what it says. Nobody's gonna see it anyway.
I'm grounded forever.
well, it serves you right.
I guess that means no "top gun," right?
you, too.
you guys both totally ruined that party.
why do you always hit me?
mom.
is--is everything okay?
I REMEMBER When they all got home that night.
Kevin asked me if everything was gonna be okay.
God, I wish it had been.
Oh William. Damn you.
if you hadn't bought that lake, none of them would've found out about any of this.
now I DON'T KNOW .
if any of them will.
and I don't know why I'm standing here talking to you.
I hate you, William.
I hate how much you hurt this family.
but I'm gonna repair this if it's the last thing I ever do.
and then I am never coming back here again.
after all the things we found out about dad, the one thing that I always knew I could count on was Mom.
now I'm not so sure.
are you okay?
uh, no. no.
actually, I'm not.
I-I have to go in for my first look on Monday.
Oh, god. do you?
uh, yeah, I do.
your cancer's not coming back, Kitty. I promise.
Oh, you know what, Sarah. Please don't say that.
I mean, you can't promise me anything.
you don't know anything.
nobody can promise me anything.
and--and I just--I hate it when people say that.
you're right.
I DON'T KNOW.
I'm just, um,
I'm scared.
Kitty, you're right.
I can't promise you anything, except this one thing-- that I will always be there for you.
Good.Good.
cause you need to, uh, finish the dishes.
Nora, we need to talk.
call me. ugh.
where is your Mom, and what the hell is going on with her?
you're asking the wrong guy.
I am literally the last person to know anything in my family.
mom, Justin's not gonna sell.
well, good. That's great.
but what about your Mom and Kevin and everybody else?
can you talk some sense into them?
uh, no. no, I can't.
with all due respect, I'm not them.
they--they make their own decisions.
so just see me as me, just like I see you-- the mother of the woman I love.
I didn't pay him to say that.
um, YOU'RE RIGHT, Justin. I'm sorry.
Oh, IT'S FINE.
Hey, HAS This painting always been here?
actually, it used to be in your father's office.
Oh, that's why it looks so familiar.
Yeah, my mom painted it.
it's this place that William used to take me-- up the 5, a little cabin by the lake.
a cabin by the lake?
mom, A LAKE?
Oh, my god.
so anything?
well, the land in question was owned by a William.
Walker?
Hearst.
they donated it to the state of california a few years ago.
so basically it's-- it's just a beautiful lake. that's all.
mom, I'm so sorry.
Oh, it's okay, sweetheart.
don't give up. - I won't. Thank you. Bye.
I mean, what--what if she's doing all of this for nothing?
what if it doesn't lead anywhere?
where will she be then?
what?
what?
what were you just thinking?
maybe we should do it.
get married, right here, right now.
Justin, don't joke about that. You know--you know I would.
I'm not joking. I promise.
Rebecca, you asked me to marry you in Mexico, right here, right now, just us, and I said no because my family wasn't there.
you are my family.
it's not about them. It's about us.
so let's walk in there " - OKAY.
okay? - Yeah.
you wanna? let's go.
Justin, repeat after me.
I,Justin, take you, Rebecca, to be my lawfully wedded spouse.
I,Justin, take you, Rebecca, to be my lawfully wedded spouse.
I,Rebecca, take you, Justin, to be my lawfully wedded spouse.
do you promise to love one another in sickness and in health,
I do.
I do.
then BY THE VIRTUE Of the authority vested in me,
I pronounce you married under the laws of the state of california.
okay, why are you telling me about something that happened 20 years ago?
Because,Scotty, there was a fight.
apparently,
okay, will someone please just tell me what's going on?
Scotty, Scotty, Aaron fell. He was paralyzed.
Kevin found out today.
Oh, my god. That's why he wasn't there.
uh, we had our, um, second implantation today. - Oh, god.
I-I waited with Michelle for two hours.
I kept telling the doctor,"he'll be here. Just give him
I mean, he didn't even call. Do you know where he is now?
no. - No. we have no idea. That's why we came here.
I want to sell ojai.
what are you talking about? The secret is out, Sarah. York has no leverage.
it's not about York, Saul. It's about Kevin. It's about this family.
we've just--we're paying too high a price.
I don't want anything else to do with dad, his secrets
Sarah, that's ridiculous. You're just-- - Saul, she's right.
enough with protecting this--this legacy. Let's just be free of it.
Oh, my god. are you okay?
what the hell is this? Why are you even here?
we--we couldn't find you.
and scotty didn't know about Aaron.
so we--we filled him in.
did you tell him how dad covered it all up by paying the family for years, and when he died, mom took over? Did you tell him that?
she was in a terrible position. What would you have her do?
please, please, do not do that, Saul. Because she is as bad as my father.
actually, she's worse. She pretended to be above it.
what have I done?
Kevin, it is not your fault.
I ruined his life, Scotty. He was a kid.
Oh, MY GOD. The implantation. I am so sorry.
it--it's okay. - I'm
Yes, it is. I went through with it.
you did? - we would've lost the embryos.
Kevin. Kevin, wait. - Kevin. Kev
look, look, I'm, uh, I'm really sorry.
I thought coming home would help, but I actually can't breathe.
I just need some air. I just need some air.
I'll call you. I'm fine.
don't you get it?
that lake, what-whatever it is, is the key to getting your family back.
Holly, you know what? You are one of the most insensitive people I have ever met.
I'm not being insensitive.
I know what happened to Kevin, and if you want your children back
well, thank you so much for stopping by, but I have to tell you, i
then don't let them sell ojai foods!
I know better than anyone that ojai is a family business.
and once their anger fades, they are going to regret letting it go.
Sarah and Tommy, they grew up there.
and you've seen how much they have thrown themselves into that place.
Holly, I really can't tell them what to do right now.
I've made enough mistakes as it is.
so what if you've made mistakes?
every single mother in the history of mankind has made mistakes.
well, you oughta know.
look, I did what it thought was best for Rebecca.
that's what you did with Kevin.
we were just protecting our kids.
so don't stop protecting them now.
Yes.
it's the lake.
we have to find the lake.
I've got a plan.
repeating the same thing slower and softer is just condescending.
well, if you don't have the authority to change the reservation, put your manager on, and I'll hold.
okay.
Hey, Mrs. Walker.
Ooh, I like the sound of that. - Oh, you do?
can you hold on one second? Thank you.
babe, do you see the, uh,"press your own penny" there thing?
can you-- can you get me one?
you want a flattened penny? - I like tchotchkes.
or are you just trying to get rid of me because you don't want me to hear what you're planning?
well, can't a man surprise his wife, for god sakes?
okay, look, I'm sorry. I know the house was rented.
but I just got married, and we eloped, and I wasn't able to plan a honeymoon.
I mean, i-i really want to make this special.
my name is Justin Walker,
Yeah, Nora and William's youngest.
uh, everybody's good.
so is there anything you can do?
Oh. thank you. Thank you so much.
I-I'll call you back. I'll call you back.Thank you.
honeymoon is all set.
it is? - Yes.
here's your souvenir.
uh, and you know what else they have here?
what?
they have the best date shakes in all of california.
milkshakes for breakfast? I knew I married you for a reason.
Mr. Burnett? Right this way.
Oh, thank you.
Hey. how'd it go?
did Kevin call? - No. no, not yet. You okay?
let's just get outta here.
wait. W-WAIT A minute. wait a minute.
this is your first look .
you know, what's going on with the cancer.
I WANT TO KNOW What's going on.
Oh, god. It was fine.
I had a c. t. I had my blood drawn.
it's just--i don't know. It's just being back here is
you remember that girl, the girl with all the piercings?
Yeah. - Well, she's back.
and she's having another round of chemo. I mean, that's the thing, right?
you either get lucky or you don't.
well, whatever happens, we're gonna go through it together.
Oh, it's Kevin.
kit, you have to do me a favor.
call Scotty. Tell him I'm okay.
I'm just not ready to talk yet.
sure, but, Kevin, what-- what's going on?
Kevin, it's me.
I'm outside Aaron's house. I have to face him, Kit.
we have to talk about what I did.
Kevin, I don't understand.
what-- what are you talking about, what you did?
I'm gonna go, all right? But I love you.
what HAPPENED TO YOU?
disappeared.
can I tell you something?
and you have to promise you won't say anything to anybody.
of course.
I'm so drunk, I probably won't remember anything anyway.
all right.
um, you know that kid that I was with tonight, um, Aaron?
Yeah. He thought I liked him.
so?
I mean,"liked him" liked him.
do you? - No. no.
no. I don't-- I don't know.
maybe.
I mean, I haven't seen him in, like, a year.
and I've been--i've been thinking about him a lot.
tonight, when we were alone,
I did the stupidest thing.
what?
Oh, GOD. I'm gay, aren't i?
I am. I am. I'm totally gay.
it's okay. - No, it's not.
Kitty, I mean, mom would have a breakdown. And dad?
dad would kill me.
I wouldn't care.
you wouldn't? Aren't you a republican?
but I'm your sister first.
I'll always love you, no matter what.
Hey. Can I help you?
Aaron?
I'm Kevin Walker.
thank you for seeing me.
I've been in my car the past few hours trying to find the courage to come in here.
I'm not sure what you think this is gonna accomplish.
you sure waited a long time TO STOP BY.
aaron, I am so sorry.
I-I-I didn't know what had happened to you until last night.
um, this might sound crazy.
my parents told me that you were fine.
obviously,
I-I'm sure you must be feeling a lot of things right now, but, uh, that night, I don't dwell on it.
of course. uh, absolutely.
and--and I'm not trying to make this about me.
then why are you here?
I'm gay, and I needed you to know that.
I knew you were gay.
why do you think I tried to kiss you?
and--and I wanted to, believe me, so badly.
but I was--i was so scared .
- You hit me.
look...
I had a lot of rage about what happened, and I'm not gonna pretend it wasn't directed at you.
but not anymore.
I moved on.
I have a partner now. We have a life.
happened.
you were just acting the way the world wanted you to.
I made peace with that.
and you need to do the same.
not with me.
Oh, my god. This is beautiful.
well, look, I know it's not the four seasons, but what do you think?
I love it. Where did you find this place?
well, remember the ojai house my family used to own?
this is the ojai house?
Oh, my god. I can't believe it. I've heard so many stories.
well, look, the people who bought it, they rent it out now, so I was able to talk the landlord into giving it to us.
I love that you brought me here.
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. - WHAT?
we're IN! We're in.
okay, target on the move.
Holly, I-I just really don't know that I can do this.
what? of course you can. Just keep him talking.
well, what if I can't?
don't chicken out on me now. You're Louise, remember?
I thought you wanted to be Louise? You said she had street smarts.
fine. fine. then be Thelma. Just keep him in his chair until you get a text from me.
all right. Just be quick about it.
I will.
excuse me. Are you gonna be much longer? I just need to change.
I'm just leaving. - Oh, great.
would you like turn down service later?
Absolutely. - Thank you.
thanks for seeing me.
Ah, I wish this wasn't such a contentious deal.
it never felt like a deal. It felt like an ambush.
if you came down here to vent
no, I DIDN'T. I-I didn't.
I'm sorry. I came down for this.
this is an agreement guaranteeing that if the sale of ojai goes through, you won't let any of the employees go for at least a year.
and I thought that you and I should go through this together.
won't be necessary. - There--y--look, I--I
honestly, I don't want there to be any misunderstanding
look, I have no intention of firing anyone.
as a matter of fact, I hope to be hiring soon.
hiring?
Oh, come on, Dennis. You won. Give me a hint.
what makes ojai foods so valuable?
nice try.
if you don't mind, I really should get back to my room and make a few calls.
what happened to you?
you used to be so sweet.
Yeah.
that was before William ended up with pretty much everything I ever wanted the business, you.
I think it made me crazy.
it could've been you and me, Nora.
I don't know. Sure. I-I-I wondered.
sorry. I have to go. Wish I could stay. Kind of an emergency.
listen, could you at least answer my question?
right.
the thing about William, he never wanted to openly hurt anyone.
that's why he hid everything.
you, on the other hand, take pleasure in it.
did I ever wish I had left William for you?
no. Not for a second.
I completely struck out. - You didn't find anything?
no, no, all I found is a bunch of receipts. I don't know what they're for.
wait a minute. What's this? - It's a valet ticket.
bingo. - Bingo?
could we have our car right away? We're trying to get to the movies. We don't want to be late.
what are you doing? - Well, isn't it obvious?
you didn't find anything in his room. He doesn't have an office.
he must keep everything in his car.
so, WHAT, You're gonna take his car?
we're gonna look in his car. You started this, Holly. Here he is. come on.
I've created a monster. Nora, think before you act.
just look in the car, holly. Thank you so much.
he has one of those navigational gps systems.
that means if he's been to narrow lake, maybe it'll be logged in.
that's true. okay. - That's good. that's good.
just look on that side of the car, Holly. Look under the seat.
Oh, my god, that's him. Nora, get out of the car.
get in the car, Holly. - Nora, get outta the car!
get in the car. Get in the car. Get in the car. Get in the car.
and we're not closer to finding narrow lake.
the only destinations that he flagged are the ones where he could get food.
would you please stop singing? You're driving me crazy.
I'm trying to remember the rest of the song.
it's William's song about narrow lake. I can't remember it.
well, at least you didn't exaggerate about the shakes. They're very good.
I know. Aren't they great?
Mm-hmm. We always used to stop here on our way to the old ojai house.
all the kids had to have a date shake.
we GOTTA GO. There's a lot more in the gps.
come on, Nora. let's go. Put some pep in your step.
what? What did you say?
put some pep in your step.
with a p-pepper in your stepper.
with a pepper in your stepper and a gleam in your eye ?
we'll follow the dream to our future, you and I ?
that's it. that's it. - That's the song that william used to sing?
with a pepper in-- - that's awful.
with a pepper in your-- with a pepper in your stepper
with a pepper--with a pepper-- with a pepper in your stepper?
what the hell does that mean?
Oh, it means he had too much to drink.
Oh, Holly, tell me again, when was it that William bought narrow lake?
the summer of '73.
the summer of 1973, I had 4 kids all under the age of 6.
william worked all the time.
did he ever take a business trip and you didn't know where he was going?
come on, Holly. William took an excessive amount of business trips.
I just chose to ignore them.
but did he say he was going to buy land?
no, I don't know. I don't remember.
wait a minute. Wait a minute.
and I remember it only because, the night before, he took me to this party somewhere in malibu, and he spent the entire time flirting with this leggy blonde, and I had to stand in the corner and chat with his business associates about produce all night.
but did he say he was going to buy land?
cause it might have been narrow lake.
he's hanging all over this blonde.
next morning, he says he has to go look for land.
no, NO. He spent the entire weekend in bed with the blonde.
you don't know that.
if I've learned anything, I've learned that.
unless you have proof to the contrary.
I think we should talk a-a
Oh, it's Robert. - No, no, don't answer it.
but it might be about Kevin. I have to answer this.
I just got off the phone with Kitty. She spoke to Kevin. He's fine.
Oh, thank god.
what was that?
um, nothing. It was the TV.
Nora, where are you?
don't say anything. - Um, I'm--i'm taking a little road trip.
right now, while your family's in the middle of a crisis?
well, I'm upset. I gotta go. - Stop it!
Nora, something is going on. You are ahorribleliar.
all right.Fine.
I'm looking for narrow lake with Holly.
we just stole Dennis york's car. - No!
it was unintentional, and I'll get it back to him.
I just don't want it to hurt Kitty's campaign.
you should've thought of that before you stole a car!
hindsight is 20-- - give me the phone. Give me the phone.
all right, look, I'm sure that this is Holly's fault
I had nothing to do with this.
Hi, Holly. Where are you?
we just pulled off the 150
don't TELL HIM Where--don't tell-- - you're driving around !
well, we can't take the surface streets to ojai.
look, I know that Nora is nutty enough To do something like this, but you?
Hi, Robert. This is nutty Nora.
okay, could I just have one conversation at a time?
did York see you take the car?
no. Well, maybe. okay. Yeah, I think he did.
you cannot be driving around in a stolen car.
we're not gonna be driving around in a stolen car. All right?
we're gonna-- we're gonna pull over someplace And we're gonna figure all of this out.
and I know the perfect place.
Oh, god, I'm so lucky.
Yes, you are.
Oh, I love you so much. - I love you, too.
hello. - Hello. !
what the hell? - Why?
the--the door was unlocked. - We're so sorry.
what the hell is going on? - We were in the area.
Yeah, we were looking for narrow lake, and we needed a
I called the real estate office. They said you were here. - Yeah.
what? - Is that all they said?
should THERE HAVE BEEN Something else?
no. - no, no, no.
gosh, we're sorry to interrupt your romantic little weekend.
we'll just go-- - we're gonna go into the kitchen.
great idea.
take your time. Take your time .Take your time. Take your time.
thank you for that, ma. That's--that's really sweet.
so much. - I hate them.
you know, I think it's really amazing that you talked to Aaron today.
you know, Kev, I had to go to the hospital this morning.
they gave me a test to see if my cancer came back.
are you having any symptoms?
it's just a standard procedure.
uh, I'm still waiting for the results.
but the--the point is, is I don't know whether they're gonna be good or bad.
and if they're good, I suppose that means that somebody else is gonna get a call saying that their cancer is back.
it's NOT THE SAME. You--you didn't cause that.
that's true.
but what happened to Aaron was an accident, too.
why he fell the way he did .
there's no answer to it.
is Kevin okay?
Yeah. well, I don't know.
he's with Kitty. He won't talk to me.
well, mom, you know, I did a lot worse than lying when I was using, and you all forgave me.
he gonna forgive you. It's just gonna take time.
are you expecting someone?
what are you doing here?
I rented this place. What are you doing here?
mom, have you lost your mind?
I know this looks bad.
robert just called me to say that you've stolen a car.
what, you stole that car?
I was gonna tell you about that.
mom, whatever you're doing, stop.
Oh, MY GOD. There are more of you.
I told you not to tell Robert anything.
what else did you tell her not to say? Is she responsible for this?
no. It was my idea to steal the car.
we're trying to find narrow lake.
that makes perfect sense. You're driving around in a stolen car looking for a lake that you don't think exists.
why don't you let her explain?
because she's not making any sense.
Sarah, I know it sounds crazy
Yeah, it does, mom, but I don't want to hear it.
I promised Robert that I would tell you to return the car.
so return the damn car. Tommy, are you coming?
Sarah! Please. Please don't just leave.
after WHAT JUST Happened, it's a little hard to get excited about a lake, mom.
I'm so sorry. I made a lot of mistakes.
I'm not a perfect person. I'm sorry.
well, it's a little late for apologies.
look, sell ojai or don't sell ojai. I don't care.
but Holly and I need more time. I have to find narrow lake. - OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, Guys? stop it.
has it even occurred to you why Rebecca and I are here?
did something else happen?
Yeah, we got married.
what?
Oh, my goodness. - When?
at the court house. we eloped. This is our honeymoon.
I-I-I stupidly thought this would be the perfect place to come celebrate our marriage.
okay? so figure it out. Who the hell is that?
I'm looking for Nora Walker.
- Harper?
you're both under arrest.
I can't really blame them, eloping.
I suppose so, but I missed my only daughter's wedding.
well, when we get out of here, we'll throw them a great big party.
Yeah. We'll have to celebrate.
Holly. Thanks.
thanks"? We were just booked for grand theft auto.
Yes, I know. Well, that's my fault.
maybe they're right what they say. Sometimes, it's about the journey,
well, if i didn't know better, I would think we were almost friends.
what? - Well, I should've told you about this this morning, but our history is so complicated, and I didn't want to rock the boat.
Oh, god. Should I brace myself?
you know that leggy blonde that you saw william flirting with at the party in '73?
that was me.
you?
Yeah, that was the first night I met him.
Holly, forget about it. Forget about it. I don't care.
I am so over this, I can't begin to tell you. Honestly.
I knew he was a womanizer.
I just wanted to keep what we had, our family, and--ugh, who cares?
I know you think that he slept with that leggy blonde
you. - Me--that weekend.
and you want it proved to the contrary.
well, I've got it.
it was more than a month before we had sex.
I really wouldn't push it if I were you. - I know, I know, I know.
but what I'm saying is, he wasn't with me, so maybe he was really looking for land like he said.
Oh, my god.
you mean, maybe he was telling me the truth for once?
maybe he was out looking for land? - It's possible.
but that doesn't give me-- - check-out time, ladies.
Oh.Oh, Robert.
hang on just one second. this is too good.
Oh, no! no! No!
Oh, it's mom. - I'm not here.
Hi, mom.
uh, yeah, yeah, he's here. He's, uh, he's doing okay.
what? You're kidding me.
well, Y-- Well, yeah, of cour-- well, yeah.
Yes, mom. I-I said that I would tell him.
but you need to let me get off the phone.
what? - Well, you're never gonna believe this.
our baby brother got married.
you're right. I don't believe it.
and they're--they're all up at the old house in ojai.
and they're having a dinner.
Oh, no. - Kev, Kev, you gotta go.
no. - Oh, yes, Kevin. We have to go.
your brother got married.
you all right? - No, but, um, I'm here.
look, I'm really sorry about what happened.
you don't need to apologize. All right?
I should've pushed dad for some more answers.
well, we were kids. We just did what we were told.
but I don't want you guys to sell the company because of me.
we'll talk about it later. - Okay.
is that Scotty? - Yeah. All right.
I'm--I'm glad you're here.
well, I'm here because of Justin and Rebecca.
Rebecca, I always wanted the perfect wedding for you
the flowers, the music and the dress.
but, sweetie, I have never seen you happier.
I am so happy that you're gonna be part of our family.
thank you.
Oh, and,Rebecca, I talked to you father, because he is determined to walk you down the aisle.
Cheers.
okay, Justin. You really are an amazing little brother.
we can always count on you for compassion and kindness.
and you're also a handful. Come on. let's face it.
you've made more than your fair share of mistakes. - Yeah, that's right.
but you always come back .
. . . and family.
Cheers.
Oh, hear, hear!
and I havephotos. - Oh, stop!
I'll delete them for the campaign, but how about that, huh?
can YOU TEXT It to me before you delete it?
that is awful. I hate you.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Dr. Avadon.
um, actually, I'd--i'd like to say something first.
I guess if there's one thing I've learned recently it's, uh, nothing makes sense in this world.
it's a mystery to me how anything happens.
but it's what we do about it that counts.
how you both met-- that was fate.
but that doesn't mean it was easy, and a lot of things came between you and your love.
but you showed faith in each other and in the future, and that's what I'd like to toast.
thank YOU, KEVIN. Cheers.
Kitty, what's wrong?
nothing. I just-- . .
that was really beautiful, Kev.
Kitty, what's going on?
I just got my results from my first look cancer checkup.
and I'm cancer-free.
I'm in remission.
see, didn't I say? oh!
sib hug. sib hug. OH!
mom. I swear, you could make cake stranded on a deserted island.
you're, like, the MacGyver of food.
well, I'm glad you liked it.
Oh, honey, I know I didn't . .
I wanted you to know how happy I am for the two of you.
and I'm so proud of you.
Oh, thanks, mom. I love you.
Oh, and just think, one more dinner in the old ojai house.
you know all those summers we used to spend up here as kids, you know, running around trying not to kill each other?
you know what my favorite part was, mom?
when you'd call us in from the backyard.
Oh, YES. You would all come racing in, tripping all over each other trying to be the first one at the dinner table.
but you-- you would want to know everything about our day
whatever crazy idea we had or whatever, you'd listen to it all.
you made us feel like the most important people in the world, mom.
well, at least I did something right.
you did.
am I interrupting? - No.
no, after you two barging in on my honeymoon today
Oh, right. - sorry.
I can't believe we interrupted your honeymoon.
you know, the "press a penny" place with the date shakes?
Yeah, we each had one.
Oh, my god. - What?
I know it's lame, but
no. Holly, that weekend.
what weekend?
well, your mom remembers this weekend in the summer of '73
when your dad said he was looking for land.
I remember now. He brought me back one of these.
so he was . .
somewhere around here.
Wow. I'm gonna get the map.
Tommy, what if we're making a mistake selling ojai?
would you ever think about coming back?
I don't know.
hypothetically? - Yeah.
strawberries.
I like that idea.
okay, so these are all the destinations in york's gps?
Yes, here's the list right here.
Yeah, we kept going in a circle, which is what I said.
we kept passing the same hill with the same mesquite tree.
you know that tree, Saul, that great big tree, right there at the turn off at 150?
Yeah, I know it, except it's a pepper tree.
it's a pepper tree?
I'm nervous. Cleaning calms me.
come on, Nora. Tommy's coming home.
that's a good thing. - Don't step on my wet floor. Please.
put the flowers over there.
and, Saul.
Tommy said he had a surprise for us.
do you know what it is? - I have no I ...
what the hell is this?
I framed that for you.
we all look so young.
Nora, we were young.
listen, this picture was taken by a detective, not Annie Leibovitz.
william had us followed? That's inconceivable to me.
I wasn't even married to him at the time, and william had Brody and me followed.
all right, so tell me, why are you giving me this photo?
well, because I think it's a good picture of you.
that is ridiculous.
you keep this.
you're the one who's obsessed with Brody. - That's not true.
okay, fine. I'll keep it.
that's probably Brody on the phone.
you better go get it. - Will you stop it?
go get the phone. - Okay, I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming.
hello.
it's Tommy.
Tommy's landed.
so.
do you want to tell me what the surprise is now?
all right. Fine. No, that's fine.
fine. So I'll see you soon.
love you. Bye.
what in god's name is he gonna spring on us now?
Nora, come on. Surprises are supposed to be fun.
not in this family.
I just want him back.
I'll see you tonight, honey, okay? - Okay.
Nora. - Yeah?
you missed a spot.
why do you bother choosing clothes?
they're gonna end up on the floor.
Oh, my god. What are you doing here?
your flight wasn't till 12: 00.
Oh, my god.
I was just about to leave to pick you up from the airport.
I took a cab.
I missed you so much.
here. Let me take this - Okay, listen. - What?
you and I, we can never be apart that long again.
if you go to Shanghai, I'm coming with you.
I could get used to dim sum.
I will never leave you again.
you know, Tommy's coming back today.
I've been thinking about asking him to walk me down the aisle.
that would be perfect.
Sarah, please don't take it.
it's probably mom about Tommy. I'll be really fast.
why you guys always answer the phone?
I'll be two seconds. - I don't get it.
Hi, mom. Speak fast. Luc just got in.
well, tell him I said hi, and I will see him tonight. Okay?
listen, Sarah, Tommy called. He just landed.
he has a great big surprise for all of us.
what is it? - Maybe he's moving home.
wouldn't that be great?
do you think that's what it is?
I'd have no idea, mom.
you talk to Tommy more than any of us.
hello.
Justin. - how was your trip?
do me a favor. Get your mom off the phone now.
I would love to spend some time with Sarah.
got it. Get it. Good. Done. Dialing
thank you.
I just don't know why he would tell me there's a great big surprise and not tell me what it is. So. wait.
hold on. Someone is calling.
it's Justin. Maybe he knows something.
I'll talk to you later. - Okay. Bye, mom.
you're a genius.
Oh, what did I do without you around?
look, mom, Tommy could be bringing the space needle back from Seattle.
I'm just really glad we're finally gonna get to see him.
look, Annie's here. I gotta go.
is she still joining us tonight?
Yes, that's the plan.
do you want me to introduce her as your girlfriend?
Yes, mom. She is my girlfriend.
sweetheart.
that's the first time I've heard you say that.
Yep, you're breaking up.
driving through...
all right. Okay. Good bye. Good bye. - Love you, mom.
so I'm your girlfriend now?
Yes. I hope that doesn't come as a surprise to you.
no, it doesn't.
but you being here is a surprise.
I thought you had the day off. - No. I, I picked up a shift.
but don't forget, this afternoon, we gotta hit that softball diamond.
little brave hearts cap on.
you know I like it when you get all sporty on me.
do you?
morning.
I was hoping I would run into you guys today.
so do you see him as much as I do?
cause you're you're kind of around, like, a lot.
Yeah, well, a resident very rarely leaves the hospital, Justin.
although this afternoon is an exception.
why is that?
well, J.D. tores his rotator cuff.
J. D.'s hurt?
who the hell's gonna pitch for us?
well. I am.
but don't worry.
you know, uh, the game before I left, I pitched a shutout.
tell him. Tell him.
he pitched a shutout.
you could try getting a little bit more excited than that.
no, trust me, okay? I was amazing.
okay, how about this?
he pitched a shutout and was amazing.
it's like having a cheerleader.
have you seen her in a baseball jersey yet?
I mean, she looks way better in it than we do.
that's awesome, right?
I'll, uh, see you on the field.
will do. - Can't wait.
see ya.
you know what?
just ignore him.
it's not worth it. - Annie, I'm trying to.
he's everywhere. He's at the e. r. He's at the taco truck.
he he's now taking over for J. D. on the softball diamond.
come on. Like, he's clearly still interested in you.
but I'm not interested in him. Okay?
I broke up with him.
fine. I'll tell you what, - I'll ignore him if you do, too. - Great.
deal? - Yeah.
my grandma could pitch a shutout, by the way.
just so. - Let it go. Just let it go.
is the wall color okay?
we weren't see if yellow was gonna be too bright.
Yeah, and we didn't want to do pink, cause we thought it might be too girlie.
not that there's anything wrong with being pink or girlie.
no, of course not.
you know, we-green, purple-we can do any color of the rainbow.
yellow's cool.
I'm just here for the weekend anyway.
Yes, you are, but eventually, you'll be living here, so - And we want you to be comfortable.
Yeah, you know what?
live with it for this visit.
if you think yellow isn't you, we can totally repaint it by the time you - Totally.
I think I'm just gonna draw if that's cool.
Yeah, of course. - Absolutely.
before you do that, there's something we would like to give you.
and you can change this, too, if you don't like it.
is it yellow?
I'm not sure. Is it?
I'm kidding.
you guys don't need to buy me anything, you know?
it's my mom.
sorry. - Go ahead.
sorry.
it's his mom. She can wait. Believe me.
open your present. - Yeah.
I like the wrapping. - Good.
the box is ringing.
I think I know what it is. - Yeah. Sorry.
let me just see.
mom, what are you doing?
well, I'm sorry.
I couldn't resist.
I just wanted to find out does she like my gift?
no, you couldn't resist talking to her.
what if she'd picked up?
you're gonna meet her, okay?
can you just calm down?
can I draw now? - Yeah.
you know what?
I'm gonna go find out if we have everything we need for dinner.
could you, uh, grab her some paper?
I have a notebook. - Okay.
Kevin. Kevin, listen, give her some space.
don't push.
Hi, pot. This is kettle. You're black.
all right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
but tell me, does she like it?
I don't know.
why don't we let her try it before we run out of minutes?
well, I got her an unlimited plan.
of course you did.
look, I know you guys can't come tonight.
I'm meeting Tommy for coffee.
well, good, good.
did he happen to tell you anything about a big surprise?
no. Bye, mom. - Oh, all right. bye.
I am so sorry my mom ruined your surprise.
but she just wanted you to be able to reach us anytime.
but pretty cool, huh?
you can text me anytime you want.
I'm a huge texter.
I might even tweet you. - Who's tommy?
he's my brother, and I'm just gonna grab a quick coffee with him.
and while he does that, I thought you and I could go shopping.
we stocked up, but I'm sure we've missed a couple of things.
so why don't you just write down some stuff you think you might need on that list?
if you want to go hang out with Tommy - No. Are you kidding me?
I want to hang with you. - If it's okay with you, I'm gonna draw.
okay.
mom! Mom.
Tommy? Tommy. Tommy. Honey.
I'm so glad to see you.
welcome home.
mama Nora.
I'm so excited to meet you.
Tommy's told me everything about you.
well, that's funny, cause he's told me absolutely nothing about you.
surprise.
if there's one place not to have your iPod playing, - it's the pike place fish market. - That's right.
that's where they throw the fish for the tourists.
right. So I was listening to katy perry.
right, and outta nowhere, this mackerel started heading straight for her head.
hello. Tommy?
Sarah. We're in here, honey.
where are you, little brother?
come here and give me a hug.
Sarah, hi.
it's so nice to meet you.
Sarah, this is Rose.
this is Tommy's surprise. - Wait. Come on, mom.
can you let her finish the story?
okay, I'll do the quick version first. Okay. - Do the all right.
so Tommy leaps in front of the fish, and he catches it right before it hits me smack in the middle of the face.
Aughs I mean, could you imagine?
death by mackerel.
death by mackerel.
Sarah, let me give you a real hello.
hello.
Tommy just thinks the world of you.
good.
maybe I can get a hug out of him. - Of course you can.
honey. - It's so good to see you.
it's been too long.
listen, Luc's sorry he couldn't get over this morning.
he just got off a 15-hour flight.
but he's coming for dinner tonight? - Oh, sure.
he's just sleeping off his jet lag.
listen, we're really hoping to spend a bit of time with you before you go back, okay?
me, too. I can't wait to meet him.
Yeah, great. The four of us will do something.
Sarah, how about some coffee?
come on in. Everybody sit down.
you know, Rose, we just haven't heard a peep out of Tommy about all of this.
I wish I would've met you sooner.
you sound like all of our friends back in Seattle.
they keep asking,"when are you gonna come up for air?
it's my fault.
I couldn't get enough of him. - Stop it.
it's the honeymoon phase, you know?
I had to prepare her to meet the family.
how long have you guys been, uh, together?
six months. - Six months.
and three days.
so it takes six months and three days to prepare someone to meet the family?
no, no.
your family is amazing.
in fact, when, uh, I wanted to bring you a gift, Nora, Tommy said.
so instead, I thought I would make you a family tree.
I made one for my best friend. She loved it.
so I hope you don't mind, but I started one for you.
it's not ready yet.
your family is fascinating.
let's talk about your great-uncle Mickey.
I I didn't even know I had a great-uncle Mickey.
Yeah. He saved 33 children from cholera.
I mean, that's amazing, huh?
Oh, my god.
I must sound like a stalker.
the truth is, I I'm just obsessed with history.
in fact, I did one of those civil war reenactments once.
a family tree is much simpler.
Yeah, I bet.
I think I'm a little nervous.
no. You're doing great. Okay? - Okay.
now you see why she's the light of my life?
you said that the first day we moved in together.
that's right.
you live together?
mom, yeah.
no, no. It's it's it's great.
just, you know, a surprise.
a wonderful surprise, but a big ol' surprise.
Yeah.
you ready to go?
what's this?
just the list of stuff that I want.
Oh, you drew it.
okay, so this is a hat, uh, pajamas, an electric toothbrush, and - that's a gecko.
I can see that.
you don't really need to get me one.
I just think they're really cool.
Olivia, you are very talented.
Thanks.
come on. Let's go. - Okay - Here, look. That's Rose. - All right. Let me see.
she's beautiful.
I thought blondes are more your type.
no. Tommy's always been an equal-opportunity lothario.
coming from the man who dated three guys at once?
technically, I didn't date any of them.
besides, I'm married now, starting a family as we speak.
is this... Olivia's adorable.
right? - Let me see.
Oh, man. She's beautiful. - Right?
all right, while we're doing it, take a look at Annie.
give me mine back. I need to text Olivia.
that's Annie.
so is she, uh, is she the real deal?
Yeah, we'll find out after the softball game.
Yeah. So is the ex a pitcher or a catcher?
seriously, Kevin?
it's a legitimate sports question.
it's true. That is.
well, I don't know, but I know he's definitely still into her.
Yeah, but the question is, is Annie still into Dr. Rick?
well, she says she's not.
that's a hot name, by the way. - Thanks, Kev. All right?
he's a cardiology resident also.
so?
you're a 3-time war vet, all right?
he's just trying to rattle you.
go to the game, you hit a couple of home runs, and then rush back to mom's, all right?
I'm gonna need your help.
Why? What's going on?
mom had that look earlier, like when you were dating Fawn.
that's not good.
no, and Sarah kept narrowing her eyes every time we were talking.
Yeah.
she thinks she's weird. - What?
what did she call you?
no, I got a text.
what did she say?
she's weird.
Sarah's always the last one to be won over.
which is why I need you guys to back me up.
she's not weird.
she's great. She's not what you might expect.
but she's funny and smart and kind, and, yeah, she's not afraid of saying anything.
okay. Then she'll fit in fine. - Yeah. You're getting a text from her.
1-4-3. What does that mean?
what? - all right, fine.
it's this thing we do.
it means I love you.
you know, the "I" is a 1-letter word, and love's a 4-letter.
nerd alert.
anyway, she's amazing. I gotta get to Sarah's.
why isn't Olivia texting me back?
because she's still shopping with Scotty.
Yeah, I know, but I thought she'd be like Paige
thumbs permanently cramped at right angles.
you ready for your big game?
Dr. Rick doesn't know what's coming.
all right.
see you, guys.
Really? - Yeah.
should I wear it to your mom's dinner?
no. I think you should wear it after.
hello. Sorry I'm late. I'm here.
we had a red line. - Rick!
touch and go. I wasn't gonna make it.
but I saved his life quick and I'here.
glad you could make it. - Yeah, I was on time.
I guess we save lives faster than you do, huh?
he is funny.
Annie, I have a present for you.
Oh, my god. The lucky penny.
what, you think I'd lose it?
we found this on the mound right before we won the league playoffs.
Yeah. - Great having you back.
Thanks, Kell.
now control yourself, Justin. I'm taking my shirt off.
Oh, I'll try, she-hulk.
Oh, my god. What a show-off.
all right. Let's go. Play ball!
nice medium jersey, dude.
you need some help?
no, no, no, no.
I could do a leg of lamb in my sleep.
but you could chop the garlic for me if you like.
I'd be honored. - Okay.
is your room all right?
you need any more towels or anything?
Nora, I've seen department stores with less of a selection.
and that shower-oh.
I'm telling you, I could sell this place in a second.
I'm a broker.
of course, if I lived here, I wouldn't want to part with this place either.
no. This has been our home for a very long time.
did you know that your maternal grandmother had an aunt who was killed by circus dogs?
no, I didn't know that.
but now I do, unfortunately.
I am way into the family tree.
what you can find on the internet would make your head spin.
Nora, I want you to know that Tommy and I are very happy together.
well, good.
good, rose. I'm glad. I'm I'm glad.
do you feel like you lost him?
because you shouldn't.
you know, I think he actually feels like he let all of you down, like he's lost you.
Really?
you know, I think maybe you want to peel that garlic first, don't you think?
just, you know
get it all opened up before
you know what?
let's just not even chop the garlic.
let's press it and then rub it all over the lamb.
how about that?
if you would just get me the garlic press out of the top drawer.
it's the silver dooey-wad thing.
is this you?
Oh, yes.
well, that was taken a very long time ago.
Oh, and who's that?
uh, that's my brother Saul.
who's that other guy? - No one. it's just a friend.
just just a friend. You know what?
why don't you forget about the garlic?
I'll do the garlic.
you slice the green beans.
okay.
this place is cool.
how many of these stations do you own?
five. And it's all about e ad buy.
probably the last thing you ever thought I'd be doing, right?
actually, no.
do you remember in high school, you are the homeroom deejay?
I mean, you used to sell ads to businesses. - Oh, my god. Yeah.
remember? This is Sarah walker with your morning spin ?
so lame. - No, it wasn't.
you were great. You were the only reason.
you know, You've really done something great for yourself.
Thanks. Well, this is nice, Tommy, having you here.
what? - Nothing.
I mean, you go first. - Okay.
all right, listen, so it's a real estate investment project.
real estate?
Yeah, Rose is a broker, and, you know, we want to do something big.
we need seed money.
so you found a bank that wants to give you capital?
no. We're not having any luck with banks.
that's why I'm asking you.
look, we're gonna start by flipping small houses. - is this your idea or Rose's?
both.
well, you know, Tommy, if I'd have known this was gonna be a business pitch,
I would've worn different shoes.
why are you acting like this?
Tommy, I thought you were coming down here to reconnect.
I've barely talked to you in-in two months.
Yeah, well, it's not like you've been calling me.
I gave up because you would take like five days to call me back.
are we really having this argument? - Yeah.
okay, let me answer your request.
flipping houses is something you do when you catch a bubble, not after it's burst.
it's also a good time to buy.
anyway, this company's assets aren't liquid, so I couldn't invest even if I wanted to.
no, I understand. - Look, you know what?
why don't you put together a proposal? I'll - Sarah, it's okay.
so,
anyway.
what did you think of Rose?
I saw your little text to Kevin.
no, I was kidding. - Yeah.
thanks for the coffee.
I'll see you at dinner.
all right. Come on. Big hit.
batter up.
let's go, Garrett!
call it!
got it! Got it! Got it!
what are you doing, man? I had it.
Yeah, it didn't look like you did.
yeah? Well, how about you play your position, I'll play mine, all right?
all right, buddy. Why don't you calm down?
we're all on the same team. - Is everything okay?
Yeah, it's fine.
don't worry about it. You'll get the next one.
come on, slugger. You're up first.
okay, swiss chard, swiss chard, swiss chard.
okay. I have one thing left on my list.
how about you?
I'm done. - You're done? Seriously?
but I always win supermarket sweep.
but you didn't get anything from the list.
that's the whole point of the game.
I got the stuff I like.
I can see that.
I don't understand why we're shopping anyway.
what's the point of living above a restaurant if you can't even eat there?
well, because the restaurant is our business.
we're going to eat where we live.
do you still have the list?
okay.
all right, let's make a deal.
we'll get the rest of the things we need from this list, and you can keep a couple of the things you want in your basket.
do we have to play that game again?
was it lame?
kinda. - Sorry. I'm so old.
okay, vodka.
let's go.
right down the middle.
you're out!
what? What are you talking about?
I was safe by a mile.
are you... tell me you saw that.
it was close. - What?
the ball got there first, Justin.
are you serious?
Justin, I didn't see it.
Yeah, don't take it so seriously, buddy. It's just a game.
don't call me buddy, douche, all right?
What'd you call me? - You heard me. Douche, as in Dr. Douche.
whoa, whoa, Justin. Stop.
listen, I was safe, and this asshole over here you know what?
stop it! Get up!
you know, I think I'm gonna go change my earrings, okay?
first it's the dress, now it's the earrings.
you're stalling. Come on.
I just feel like I got off on the wrong foot with your family.
I mean, you should've seen your mother's face when I pulled out that photograph.
look, forget the photo, okay?
I love you.
and they know that.
and that's all that matters, okay?
okay.
thank you.
Hey, bro.
and, uh, you must be Rose.
the photos on Tommy's phone do you no justice.
thank you. You're Justin, right?
Yes, I Justin. And this is, uh, this is Annie.
this is Tommy.
good to meet you.
so, uh, how was the game? Did you win?
well, we would've if the umpire wasn't blind.
it's kind of a sore subject.
Justin was called out at home.
I was safe, uh, but she won't admit that I was. - I didn't see the play.
what was I supposed to do?
Annie, you want to, um, go get a drink?
let's do that. Yes.
so, uh, I guess it didn't go so good with Dr. Rick, huh?
Oh, yeah. You know what? Don't even ask.
but Rose she's great. - Yeah.
the family's gonna love her.
she's probably pissed you made her play that stupid sweep game.
does everybody hate that game?
well, your version doesn't actually have cash prizes at the register.
well, there could've been.
I mean, she completely ignored my list.
we can't let her eat like that.
okay, slow down, Julia child.
we all ate candy as a kid. We'll talk to her.
We-oh, you have your phone. I was afraid you lost it.
Why?
Oh, no biggie.
I sent you a couple of texts, and you didn't text me back.
I was with Scotty.
why would I text you?
sit down with me for a sec, would you?
we, uh, we want to talk to you about expectations.
so you want me to do chores or something?
no, I think what Kevin is trying to say is, when we try to reach you, it would be great if you, you know, wrote us back.
Yeah. Or like with the groceries.
because Scotty's such a good chef, he will make you think green beans are French fries.
I swear.
okay.
we have a responsibility to make sure you're healthy.
it's really important to us. - Yeah.
I've never even heard of most of the stuff that's on your list.
can I go to my room?
we're-we're not angry with you.
we just wanted to have a little talk. That's all.
I really want to go to my room.
would anyone care for some more wine? - I would.
so, everybody, uh, Sarah and I have an announcement to make.
Sarah. - You tell 'em.
is everything okay?
no, go ahead. Tell 'em. - All right.
we've set a date for the wedding.
that's wonderful.
Bravo.
okay, to Luc and Sarah and the culmination of your love.
and to Tommy and Rose and the beginning of yours.
well, they've been shacked up for months, so it's hardly the beginning.
Oh, come on, Sarah. You've been shacked up with Luc since the first time you saw him do squats.
stop it.
so when are you getting married, Luc?
may 15th.
how wonderful.
Tommy, I'm so glad you're home to be a part of this.
so you went to see Sarah's empire today, right?
Tommy wanted to pitch me this house flipping idea.
I like it.
buy low, sell high.
Thanks, bro.
well, while we're tossing around aphorisms, how about being left holding the bag?
lows could stay low a really long time.
you just have to look at Japan.
well, Sarah, we've actually thought it through.
and the numbers make sense.
in fact, it's a very transitional neighborhood full of young families.
no, I'm sure they're lovely.
the question is, can they afford a house with unemployment so high?
my cousin, actually, she just bought a house, flipped it, and made a ton of money.
Annie, I don't think you should take sides.
you're a real estate fan, too?
no, no. I'm just a softball fan.
Yeah, depends on who's playing.
Annie, if you want to have any peace, you gotta tell this guy he was safe.
I was safe, and I can't believe with all the camera phones there, no one recorded it.
well, maybe we should check youtube later.
what, you think this is funny?
I do. I think it's funny, Justin.
has he always been this competitive? - Yes.
so Tommy's here. Let's come on.
let's talk about Tommy. - Boring.
Yes, Tommy, I didn't know you were thinking about changing jobs.
what about the radio station?
what do you think?
it's very impressive.
Sarah? - What?
well, with tommy's expertise, I'm sure you can find something for him to do.
mom, this is not the time or the place.
besides, Tommy has no interest in...
Yeah, why would I have any interest in working with you?
you've been completely condescending this entire time.
well, you just showed up out of the blue and asked me for money.
what do you expect? - What is wrong with you?
I mean, do you remember before ojal closed?
we-we were gonna work together, Sarah.
how is asking me to invest in a real estate deal remotely like us working together - to save our family business, Tommy? - I don't know.
all right, stop it, both of you.
Tommy just got home, and you're fighting about business.
that's enough.
forget about the real estate.
the two of you loved working together.
is that true, Tommy?
is that what you want, to come back here and work with me?
or did you just come back to raid the piggybank so you and Rose could run back to Seattle?
cause honestly, I'd really like to know.
honestly? - Yeah.
Luc I hate to upstage your announcement, but she wants to know the real reason we came down here.
we're engaged.
and, um, I wanted my fiancé to meet my family.
that's the big surprise.
Grazie.
Tommy, that's wonderful.
we're all so happy for you.
aren't we happy for him?
mom, just stop it, all right? You don't have to do this.
Yes, I do. Tommy, please, let us reconnect.
it's not easy. You've been so far away.
it's supposed to be easy!
that's what family is. - It's okay, Tommy.
no, it's not okay, honey.
last year wasn't just hard for you guys, all right?
it was hard for me, too.
I felt lost.
probably even more.
and when I met Rose.
she made me believe in myself again.
let's go, honey.
excuse me.
you could lay them out flat.
then they won't wrinkle.
looks like that summer in retail finally paid off.
you think they're still hiring?
all right, listen, neither of us wants to be the first to blink, so just this once, I will, okay?
you hurt me, Tommy. You disappeared.
and now I know why. You met Rose.
she was so excited about meeting you guys.
well, maybe you should've told us about her before you just sprung her on us like that.
Tommy, when I heard you were coming down, I was so excited.
I couldn't wait to show you the company and for you to get to know Luc better.
when you asked me for money, I just got blindsided.
Sarah, you don't understand.
I was trying to find a way to get back into this family.
okay. Then why don't you come and work with me?
I'm serious.
look, everything looks great with the company.
but the truth is, I am lonely.
I don't even have Holly to fight with anymore.
are you serious?
I mean, come on, what could be more fun than fighting with you every day?
I'll think about it.
would you think about something else, too?
Yeah, sure.
I'd really like you to walk me down the aisle.
I was gonna ask you this morning, but I guess I got thrown by.
rose? - Yeah.
Sarah, she's a big part of my life now.
I know that.
and I am really glad for you.
and I'll try harder with Rose.
I promise. I will try much harder.
I don't want you to try.
I just want you to love me.
unconditionally.
there.
I blinked.
and, yes.
I would love to walk you down the aisle.
Thanks.
maybe we should head out.
Justin, I think you're taking this way too far.
see, I don't think I am.
it's actually pretty simple, annie.
you didn't take my side.
and I get it. I get it.
you and Rick have this long history, and you dated for a long time, and maybe you saw yourself ending up with him. Wait, do you see what you're doing here?
Justin, you're pickinng a fight with me just to push me away.
this is about you.
Justin, I like you.
and I like you. I really do. - That Then what is the problem here?
Annie, I don't think you're over him.
I don't.
and I think you want to believe that you are, but you're not.
so admit it.
you really liked Scotty's homemade mac and cheese.
Olivia, there's something that, Kevin and I want you to hear.
we have thought long and hard about how to have a family.
and we truly believe that this is the one we're supposed to have, but it's a big responsibility.
which is why sometimes you may get really mad at us when we need you to do things.
and we thought maybe you would understand things better if you had something to take care of on your own.
so. Is that a gecko?
is it for me? - yep.
thank you.
now you'll have to feed it.
it eats live crickets.
I wish we knew that before we got it.
Yeah, and you'll have to make sure it gets plenty of light.
I will. I promise.
and I'll eat whatever you guys want.
no, no, this isn't a bribe.
no, because now we're a family, You, me, Scotty, and
Zemulon. That's his name.
perfect.
because I actually have something for his terrarium.
what's that for?
well, what does it say?
can I go play with Zemulon now?
of course you can.
I mean, nametags for geckos? That's stupid.
I think I just picked that up at a legal conference.
can I show him our room? - Sure.
the shopping list. - The text.
she can't read.
no, no. No, no, no, no.
you don't want to eat those.
they they've been in there since the Bush administration.
Really? - The first one.
I am so hungry.
well, of course you are.
you've eaten nothing but salad.
and.
look.
our behavior tonight was inexcusable.
you were trying to broker a peace.
I get it.
no, I was trying to get you guys to move back here.
it was completely selfish on my part.
well, I came across kind of strong, too.
I wanted to skip that whole awkward, getting to know you part and just be at that dining room table
I've heard so much about.
rose, what you saw tonight, that's the real Walkers.
I mean, it's not a civil war reenactment, but it's close.
how does reheated lamb sound to you?
much better than olives from the '90s.
Yeah, I bet.
you know, I didn't mean to make such a big deal about that picture.
no, no, no. You no, you didn't.
I just felt like that there was a story there, you know?
I mean, did you date that guy?
it was nothing, honestly. It was nothing.
he just, I knew him in high school.
that's that's all.
a high school sweetheart.
what's his name?
his name was Brody.
Yeah.
when do we eat? I am starving.
don't worry, mom. We're fine.
that's right. In fact, Sarah says there might be an opening for me at maris media.
you mean the two of you are gonna work together again?
only if it's okay with you, Rose.
so what do you think, we move down here?
you can't just put her on the spot like that, Tommy.
let's do it.
let's move to Pasadena.
Oh, my god. This is fantastic. - I can't believe it!
come here, mom.
Yeah.
come on.
where is she?
she's getting ready.
I think she wants to impress us.
impress us? My god. I'm a nervous wreck.
I could hardly sleep last night.
midnight is a young man's game.
you know, he's in the phone book.
who? - Brody.
Brody's in the phone book.
I remembered, Brody is his last name.
his name is Nick Brody.
saul, would you just please stop it?
you're obsessed. - Nora, I think that you should call him.
Yeah, yeah, you were very close to him.
much closer than any of us ever knew. - Stop it. Honestly.
I'd just like to concentrate on today.
I'm about to meet my new little granddaughter for the very first time, - and I want to concentrate on that. - Okay.
she's almost ready.
don't be mad at me if I cry.
please tell me there aren't any leftovers in there.
no, they're not leftovers.
I brought a bunch of your favorite books from when you were a kid.
that's great. Thank you.
so did you talk to the social worker?
Yeah, I did.
a lot of kids fall through the cracks. So...
we've made an appointment to get her tested, and now we're just looking for tutors.
great.
you sound just like a dad. - Stop it. You're gonna make me cry.
Olivia, hi, Olivia.
and this is uncle Saul.
Hi, sweetheart.
I'm so happy to meet you.
thank you for my phone, Nora. - Absolutely.
I mean, if you're gonna be in this family, you gotta have a phone.
and you have to learn that whole 3 way calling thing.
I know how to do it.
do you want to meet my gecko?
your gecko?
look at that.
my goodness.
and what's his name?
look at that tail. Amazing.
how's your day going?
um, good, good.
definitely better than how my night went.
Justin, I just need to talk to you about something.
Yeah, sure.
I just want you to know that I never meant to lead you on.
you know, and I'm not saying that I'm gonna get back together with Rick. - I get it.
it's okay.
I really, really like you, Justin.
and I don't know, maybe this is too much to ask, but I just hope that we can still be friends.
Yeah.
Yeah, you know, eventually.
of course. Right. So,
so I'll, I'll see you around, Annie.
Justin, um, just one more thing.
I think you might have been safe.
I appreciate that.
Bye, Annie.
what, you're not still doing that family tree thing, are you?
you wouldn't believe the stuff you can download online Birth certificates,
marriage certificates, immigration papers.
seriously. What did we do before the internet?
Ah, hold on.
hello.
listen, I know I said that we'd meet up at the office this morning, but,
you're not having second thoughts, are you?
about working together? No. No, not at all.
no, no, it's just that, have you ever had one of those mornings where you feel like you just shouldn't get out of bed?
Yeah, all the time.
Yes, well, I am definitely having one of those mornings.
Sarah, it's fine.
say hi to Luc. - Wait, wait, wait, wait.
what I was thinking is, why don't you come over for lunch, you and Rose?
Yeah, yeah. That's great.
okay, give me a few hours, okay? - Okay. Bye.
do you think it would be weird if we got married the same month your mother did?
I don't think we want to start out with that kind of karma.
too bad.
I always wanted a June wedding.
you still can.
my parents got married in January.
Tommy, I'm looking at the marriage certificate.
it says june.
no, no, th-this can't be right.
I mean, I can't tell you how many times we went to chasen's for their anniversary party.
did she ever tell you about a guy named Brody?
no. Why?
I'm not really sure.
maybe you should ask her.
where I come from, there's only one reason people lie about their wedding date.
what, you think she was pregnant?
maybe.
no, no, no. I only just talked to the realtor.
I don't know, honey. I've never been naked in public before.
I don't know. They might all be sold out by the time you get back.
stop that.
listen, if you want one, I'll put one aside for evan's room, okay?
Kitty says "good luck." - Well, I'm gonna need it.
listen, you've gotta stop it with this- This charming french self-deprecating thing.
americans don't understand it, especially rich ones who buy art.
did you really call the realtor?
I told you about her, right? She's - She's fabulous.
she should have her own reality show.
the market is so bad, isn't it? - Exactly. Exactly. You see, you sell an asset you have equity in, you leverage up to a bigger asset, market goes up, everyone wins.
totally lost me. - So trust me.
I'm not sure if it's the right time for us, though.
no, come on. The company's doing well.
Paige is a teenager, cooper soon will be. They're gonna need a lot more space.
and he's gonna need a bigger studio - Higher ceilings, maybe a skylight. - Feels so good.
I'll just get the realtor in. She'll do an appraisal. And we'll take it from there, okay?
it's the gallery. - Okay.
my gosh. - Hey, hans.
Really? The "times" wants to do a profile on me.
Hey, hans. no. I-i-I think I found the painting. I'm gonna bring it tomorrow.
okay, this is the hard-this is the hardest one of all.
he's a british soccer player. He just played in l. a. - David beckham.
Yeah! - How do you even know that, mom?
okay, okay, this guy is a painter. - A painter.
Andy warhol. - Nice! Okay.
I know who it is. That's not the problem. This - ten...
nine...
he's a singer. - Eight...
he's got a really crazy name. - Seven...
I don't know how I knew it. - you pronounced it right, too.
all right, next time we're splitting you up. Couples can't play together.
you know what? We're winning because we're good, not because we're a couple, - and we're not a couple anyway. - I think it's safe to say we're dating, nora.
you're worried about us? What about the neighbors?
you've had a large winnebago parked in your driveway for
you want me to park it down the block? That's a long walk home every night, kevin.
you don't let him stay over, mom? - Would you-my god, this is none of your business.
and, no, not even a nap. - Well, what the hell are you guys waiting for?
well, I-I meant with each other, or sarah wouldn't have thought that he might be her father, for god sakes.
all right. That's it. Game's over. Thank you so much for coming.
I think i'll get another beer.
what is your problem? What's the matter with you?
you're making both of us very uncomfortable. - Mom, relax. It's okay.
He's- He's clearly in love with you. - Would you stop? My god. It's none of your b
how do you know he's in love with me?
come on. - Ma, he's clearly in love with you.
you know what?
I am furious with your husband for taking olivia off to get ice cream.
I made a cake. All the kids love my cake.
you didn't make a cake. You made a viennese dobos torte.
the name alone scared her off, and stop changing the subject.
all right. All right. All right.
I like him... Quite a lot.
consider us backed off. - So backing.
I think grandma was mad when we left. - I don't think so.
and even if she was, it is worth it... Because this ice cream is awesome.
don't tell her that I ordered cake batter.
you know, this chocolate-peanut butter is pretty good, too.
Scotty. - my god. What are you doing here? I can't believe it.
I was visiting my mom, and I-i'm only here for a few days, so I didn't really have time to.
I- I wish I could talk, but I really-I actu- hi, I'm olivia.
I'm-I'm sorry. This is, this is our daughter olivia.
your daughter? - Yeah.
I didn't know you guys - They adopted me.
you know, I have known michelle since I was about your age.
Scotty, I've gotta go. - You know, olivia, I just remembered, kevin asked for us to get him a pint of mint chocolate chip. Could you get us one to go?
sure. You guys want to talk. I get it.
thank you. - Scotty, listen,
I know that you want to talk and everything, but I-I can't do th michelle, seriously, where have you been?
it's new york. It's-it's intense.
Michelle, we don't blame you in any way for what happened.
we knew that when you offered to be our surrogate that - That miscarriages happen.
so you're still in new york? - For now.
and you're staying with your mom out here? - no.
listen, what are you doing tonight? I would love for you- - I- I can't do this, scotty.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm just-i'm not- I'm not doing well right now. - michelle - Mich-michelle. - I'm sorry, scotty.
Brody. What's going on with that beer?
we finally convinced mom to play another round.
you okay? - Yeah. I just, Playing a little too hard, that's all.
why-why don't you sit down for a second? - Justin, I'm fine.
you e. m.t. s never go off duty, do you?
how long have you been feeling like this? - Ever since I ate that viennese dobos torte.
well, your pulse is racing. Are you feeling chest pains right now?
Justin, justin, I probably ate too much, and I was up there throwing out clues like a pitcher at a home run derby.
okay, how many fingers am I holding up? - For goodness sake. 12.
I'm actually not kidding. How many fingers am I holding up? - Two. I'm fine.
really. I- I-I just had a physical. I'm in perfect shape. - When?
last week at st. Francis. I've been playing baseball all my life, kid.
heartburn aside, I'm probably healthier than you are. Come on.
let's get back to the game.
God. I can't believe I slept. What time is it?
Where's my house? - There's some orange juice in the fridge.
I don't want any orange juice. Where the hell are we? What's going on?
taking a trip. - What?
it was so boring, I can't begin to tell you. - And you closed your eyes, - and then you asked if you could sleep on the couch. - I remember that.
one step closer is what you said. - One step closer, yes, yes. But where are we going?
to a ball game in fresno. - What?
no, I can't go to fresno. It - It's luc's opening tonight.
for goodness sakes.
God. Who am i?
cassettes are in the glove compartment.
cassettes? People download this stuff these days.
okay, bread. The animals.
country joe and the - This is a time capsule we're in.
all right. You're stoked already. - Yeah, right.
Yeah, there's a shower in the back. - I'm not taking a shower in here.
I packed you a change of clothes. I brought your toothbrush, your purse, - your phone. - You're very, very thoughtful. You have the beach boys.
your favorite, right?
I can't believe you remember that. - Okay. Come on. Let's go.
Where's the seat belt?
well...
we could always sing instead.
how many miles is it to fresno? - in the kind of world where we belong?
so we've been here, over ten years.
we upgraded all the utilities and repainted just a couple of years ago.
listen, I know the real estate market's barely up from the slump...
but we're kind of hoping that maybe this neighborhood hasn't done as badly as some and sarah. Listen, I am totally with you, - and I'm glad that you're a realist as to where the marketis. - Yeah, I mean, I get it.
but the truth is, I can have this house sold by the end of the week... - What?
and at a price I think you will be happy with. - You're kidding?
just look at this place. You have a restored craftsman in an extremely desirable neighborhood with virtually no turnover.
othe kitchen - is that just through here?
Yeah, but I haven't cleaned up last night's sushi, - so sorry about the - it could smell like a wharf for all I care.
I have a very motivated couple who have been dying to get into this school district.
the schools are amazing. - and, now there's, the three bedrooms, there's an office in the attic?
that's right. Actually, my fianc? is using it as his art studio at the moment.
well, that makes a perfect playroom.
you know, if we signed a contract today,
I could have the leones here tomorrow for a pre-list showing.
tomorrow, sunday? - Yeah.
Sarah, but th-this is what you want, right? please don't go having second thoughts.
no. No, no, no, no second thoughts.
my god. This-this is perfect. You know, it's my fianc? s first solo art show tonight...
and we're gonna be getting married soon, so this would be, you know, a whole new beginning.
what's the line from that movie?
I'm going to sell this house today.
what movie is that?
you're dead to me, walker.
I guess that means you saw the schedule. - Yeah.
we always work together on sundays, you know, like blood brothers. - I know, I know, I know.
I forgot. I'm going fishing with brody on sunday.
this guy's really moving in?
you think he's the real deal?
I don't know, you know? I mean, he could be.
what, you don't like him? - No, I do like him, a lot, actually. I just...
look, I don't want to overreact, but I was with him last night, and the guy looked terrible.
and he blamed it on the food or he-he said he was exhausted from-from playing celebrity.
remind me not to go to your game night.
you know what I don't get? He said he got a physical last week at st. Francis, - and everything was fine. - Okay. So what's the problem?
why would a guy from modesto suddenly come to a hospital in pasadena for a physical - unless he thought something was wrong? Right? - Yeah.
well, let's find out.
I mean, a 6 year old could hack into the computer system at st. Francis.
Dan. What the hell are you talking about? Don't forget about h. i.p. a.a. Laws.
you're the one who's worried, dude. I'm trying to help.
well, don't.
I'm just taking a leak, man.
what do you mean, she seemed off? - She just wasn't the same michelle I know.
well, I'm not surprised. What did you expect? She moved across the country.
she made it perfectly clear, she didn't want to see us.
I know, but she's my friend. Maybe
she couldn't even look me in the eye.
you know, this one time in high school, she disappeared after a really bad breakup.
but she called me so that everyone would know that she was all right.
well, I thought you said she was only gone for a week. - Yeah.
then they made her go see a shrink. - What are you trying to say?
maybe. But it's hard to see her in pain like this. I want to help her.
she wasn't just our surrogate, kevin. - I don't think she wants your help, scotty.
Olivia. Hey, sweetheart. What's going on?
are you-are you excited about the zoo? When's Mrs. Turner coming to get you?
now. - Olivia, about what you just heard...
that's them. I'm gonna go get my jacket.
how long was she standing there?
long enough to wonder if she was second choice.
damn it.
Sarah? - my god. You scared me. Why aren't you at the gallery?
I-I gotta come here and get some clothes.
our realtor has a very motivated buyer who's interested in this house. - Where are my brushes?
I washed them all and put them in there - You washed my brushes?
Yeah. - You can't wash my brushes. They have to be done a certain way, sarah.
a- and what happened to my little rug that was under my chair? - that was filthy.
it was covered in paint splotches - Paint splotches? I'm painter. I use paint.
paint makes splotches, sarah. - Why are you so upset?
my picasso book-it was all completely marked. Where is it?
I-I put all the books back on the shelf. They were everywhere.
you know I found a half-eaten hot pocket behind this cushion?
this is how I do things. It's how I work.
I'm sorry. I was just-i'm trying to make it presentable. The buyers are coming tomorrow.
the buyers? You told me you were just getting an appraisal. Where is my cup?
the one with the crack? - That's my lucky cup.
I got it the day I took cooper to disneyland. The next day, I sold five paintings.
that's why you're freaking out. You're superstitious about tonight.
listen, everything is gonna be great. Your paintings are beautiful.
I'm not superstitious, sarah. I'm just going back to the gallery.
you should never have done this without asking me. You should never have done this.
I can't believe you caught a foul ball.
I can't believe I ate three hot dogs.
you know, it's getting late. I really think we should go.
well, we have to be a little late. It's an art opening.
it's the fashionable thing to do. - I see.
don't say relish. I ate three hot dogs.
God, you love baseball. You get so excited.
I'm sorry you lost your team. - Lost 'em? They fired me, nora.
Yeah, for benching a guy who was using steroids? Honestly, I think you should sue them.
10-to-nothing? And how many errors did that shortstop make?
he's playing the wrong position. He should be playing left field.
no, he should be benched. My god.
well, I'll keep that in mind.
what does that mean?
did you- Did you come out here because you thought maybe there was a... - Nora.
a job to be had? Is that it? - there is a job in it.
what? - Yeah, I got a call last week.
and, you know, they heard about me leaving modesto.
they-they said they needed a new manager, and- my god.
isn't that what your hero, yogi berra, said? You did this before.
you ran off to play baseball in 1967.
did you drag me up here just to say good-bye to me again? - Good-bye?
I want you to come with me.
Really? - Yeah.
I'm selling the house in modesto. We could get a little place up here, take the winnie on road games, see the west together.
are you serious? - Of course I'm serious.
I told the owner to wait in the restaurant across the street. - you did?
Yeah, me and my girlfriend would come over and join him later. - Girlfriend?
that's what you're calling me, your girlfriend? - Okay, I'm sorry.
Hey. I thought that's what you were.
strikeouts. And I didn't go down swinging. I was always caught looking.
pitches came my way, and I never saw one good enough for me.
you know, if-If you don't want to- Just-just-please just let me think about it.
you would think about it?
Really?
you know, there's a difference between being fashionably late and not showing up at all.
you know what else yogi said?
so what animals did you see?
a zebra, lions-stuff that you see at the zoo.
listen, olivia, about what you heard earlier today
you tried to have a baby with michelle, didn't you?
she was trying to help us, yes. - how?
what's a surrogate?
it's actually the woman who carries the baby to term, but ours wasn't born.
is that why michelle doesn't want to see you, because you're still sad?
well...
do you understand? - Yeah.
can I please wear my new leggings to luc's show? - Of course.
sounds very chic. - Cool. I'll go get dressed.
great.
think she's okay? - I don't know.
it'll be good for her to go to the show, spend some time with us.
I'm gonna have to meet you there.
Why? - Well,
I've been calling friends trying to find michelle all day, and nobody has heard from her since she left for new york.
okay, that is weird. - And then a friend said she saw her at the w hotel.
I called over to the hotel, she didn't pick up the phone, so
Scotty, I think we have enough on our hands without this.
what if something's really wrong with her? She was my best friend.
well, what am I supposed to tell olivia when she asks where you're going?
tell her the truth.
dude, are you kidding me? - You wanted answers. You got 'em.
we'll shred the copy after you look.
no.- I-I appreciate the effort, but I'm
what? - I was curious so I peeked.
B. p.130 over 80, 23 b. m.i.
and basic blood work to check cholesterol comes back better than mine.
see for yourself.
Attaboy.
see? Won't you sleep better now?
that can't be right.
what? What's wrong? He told you the truth.
no, he didn't.
he lied.
I think he's really mad at me. - Well, if you cleaned my office, I'd kill you.
Why? You can clean my office anytime, right, olivia?
I thought I was doing him a favor.
well, look at him. He's famous now.
like a jonas brother. - Yeah.
which one? - joe.
when's scotty getting here? He's gonna miss the show. - He'll be here. Don't worry.
where is scotty? - He doesn't want to talk about it in front of me.
that's not true. I told you. He's gone to see michelle.
their surrogate.
he ran into her. It's no big deal. - Then why is he going to see her?
I don't know. - Hey.
I love your leggings. - Everything okay?
she checked out.
we should probably... - Right. Yeah. Hey, do you want to look at some art?
see what I mean? They don't want to talk about it in front of me.
got it. - Come on. Come on.
I told you we wouldn't miss anything.
if we get separated, i'll meet you by the painting that looks like a mushroom.
what painting that looks like - right there.
Hey, nice stuff. - Hi. This is fabulous.
Brody. I'm french. Are you kidding?
you guys look great. - Well, you should've seen us three hours ago.
mom, brody. So I was correct.
I have been living with the next renoir.
can we get another photo? - Sure.
sorry.
well, don't they want you in the picture? - god, no. It's all about him. They don't care about me.
what foul ball? - Well, that would be the foul ball that I caught with one hand my left hand...But I happen to be right-handed, so - Someone's had a good day. - Yeah, well, you know, it was...
it was a day. It was a-it was a day.
are you okay? - I don't know.
it's like she's running away from her whole life. - Yeah.
are you guys still talking about michelle? - I'm sorry, sweetie.
you know what? You want to get one of those bottled root beers?
no, I want you to tell me why you went to go see michelle.
I just wanted to talk to her. - Yeah.
are you guys gonna have another baby with her? - No, no.
is that what you think? - I don't know.
I'm sorry.
wait, wait, wait, wait. The fresno gophers?
Yes, they're terrible, especially the shortstop. But the ball field is beautiful...
slow down. - And they want brody to manage the team.
I mean, we were sitting in the stands, and it felt like a proposal.
my god. - It's a very big deal. Of course, I would keep the house.
we'd only be there for spring and summer, but-this is silly. I-I- I- I'm not even considering it.
here you go, ladies. - hi.- hey.
I'm gonna go over and, catch up with luc, so, don't leave...Till you close the deal.
I guess that means you haven't decided yet. - No, I-I haven't. You know, let's look at the art.
look at that painting. It's fabulous.
Hey. How's it going? - Great.
I'm so proud of you. - Thank you.
Olivia thinks you're gonna be famous.
that's nice.
look, I'm-i'm sorry if I- We'll talk about it later.
it's just-it's your big night. I really didn't mean to ruin it.
you didn't ruin it. You just didn't think.
right now, I have to concentrate on my work, okay?
listen, I'm gonna go home, i'm gonna put everything back exactly where
you still don't understand why I got upset? - No.
I-I don't think I do, luc. I'm... - Luc, I need you a moment.
go.
Luc, this is mr. And Mrs. Slaughter. They are major collectors.
come on in.
is everything okay?
it was a panic attack you had last night, wasn't it? - What?
no. Why would I have a p - Brody, you lied about your blood type.
you said it wasn't possible to be sarah's father because you were type o.
you're not. You're type b.
I saw your medical records.
are you sarah's father?
it's possible.
It's-you don't know?
william was also type b. - How do you know that?
I asked him, and he told me.
he also told me to lie to your mother.
and you did? - They were married by then, justin.
so I told your mother I was type o and walked away.
did my father ever have a d. n.a. Test?
if he did, he never told me.
I can't believe this.
man. Why did you come back here, brody? - Sarah's the one who came up to find me, justin.
that's what i'm trying to tell you.
then you gotta tell her the truth.
I don't want to mess this up, not this time.
no, you know what? My mother already had one relationship that was based on lies.
I can't sleep. - What's wrong, sweetie? Come here.
can I ask you guys one more question?
of course. You can ask us any question you want.
when you decided to adopt, were you trying to adopt a baby?
no. We wanted a family.
and when we met you at the fair that day, we realized, we'd found one.
so you don't wish that I was younger when you met me? - No. Olivia, - you're perfect. The three of us - this is our family. - Yeah.
is that why michelle's mad at you, because you don't want to try and have another baby with her?
and she doesn't want to talk? - Not right now.
she's your friend. You shouldn't give up on her.
I'll tell you what
we will promise not to give up on michelle if you promise not to worry anymore.
deal. - Deal?- Deal?
deal. - Deal? Deal?
Hans' wife was nice.
she was a little bit touchy-feely. You think she was flirting with me?
I don't know. I'm gonna take out the recycling, otherwise it will pile up.
I don't wanna yell.
look, I am sorry. I'm sorry a million times that
I cleaned your studio and washed your brushes and threw out your favorite cup.
Sarah, it's not about the studio.
okay, I crossed a line, clearly, I didn't understand. - No, clearly, you didn't understand.
it's not about where we live, it's how we'll live with each other.
and you shouldn't have listed the house without telling me.
you're right. I'm sorry.
but this could be a good thing, luc.
you're gonna need space to work, space to just breathe.
but I don't want any more space.
my mom used to live all around the world
a loft in paris, a flat in geneva, a hut in the argentine jungle.
when I was staying with her, I always felt I was just, like, visiting.
this house here is the first place I truly feel safe.
Sarah, it's not about a room or a chipped coffee cup.
our family began here.
Well...Speaking of that old... Chipped coffee cup...
you had that all night?
I rescued it.
and let me tell you, it is very hard to fit in to balenciaga.
thank you.
we're home.
Nora... What are you doing up?
what are you doing up? It's 2: 00 in the morning.
I saw your light on.
I can't sleep. - No, neither could i.
I was thinking.
you asked me to think, and so I've been doing just that, and...
Yes. Brody, yes. My answer's yes.
let's get a little place in fresno. You can sell your house in modesto.
we'll keep this house, of course, then I can come back and forth.
Nora - I know, I know. Our history is complicated.
you got that right.
you got a whole life here. - I know.
and I want to come with you, brody.
I love you.
I was just going to knock on your door and see if perhaps you'd like to come upstairs tonight.
I love you, too, nora holden.
Kevin. - What?
she's right.
who? - Olivia.
we can't give up.
we have to find michelle and try to help her.
how?
when I went to the hotel, the clerk said she ordered a car service.
she had to cancel it when she checked out.
so what are you saying?
which means wherever she is, she's getting ready to leave for l. a.x. terminal 3.
that's what the clerk said.
what about olivia?
saul gets here in 15 minutes to make his hollandaise sauce.
my head's about to explode. Let's go.
sorry. I know it's early. - yeah. Come on in.
hope you don't think we're still going fishing.
I'm leaving, justin.
did you tell mom? - I tried.
I tried again this morning, too.
you kids are everything to her.
Brody, you don't even know if you're her father. All right?
at least get tested before you take off - it's too late for that now.
Sarah's better off thinking that william is her dad.
it's simpler - Easier that way after all this time.
and I need you to promise me you'll never tell your mom.
I- I can't do that. - It has to be this way...For her sake.
you realize you're gonna break her heart, don't you?
she has her family. She'll be okay.
I'm gonna miss you guys.
take care of her for me.
anything?
I've circled every self check-in kiosk twice.
I'm pretty sure the t. s.a.'s about ready to strip-search me.
should we go home? - Okay. But first, I'm starving.
you want to buy me an overpriced pretzel? - Of course.
Thanks.
I'm glad we're staying here.
he's gone.
Brody's gone.
he left me a note.
he left me a damn note.
mom...
I don't understand. He didn't even say good-bye.
I don't understand. Why did he do that?
I don't know, mom.
I don't know.
what?- That's her. - What?
Michelle! Michelle! - my god.
excuse us. - Michelle!
I need your ticket and i. d.sir. - we have to get to our friend.
only ticketed passengers. - . that could be our baby.
Justin is not gonna want to sit next to the family.
he's gonna want three hot bridesmaids, of which I have none.
I like your style.
I'm just trying to break them in.
two more days schlepping around in these puppies, and I'll feel like I'm walking down the aisle in my slippers.
what are you doing up so early?
thank you. - The sudoku chart from hell.
look at this.
she doesn't talk to him. She needs to be near the bathroom.
he won't stand for being at the back - Okay, sarah, it's 5: 00 a. m.
what are you really doing up? - I couldn't sleep.
I'm worried about mom.
I could kill brody. He really broke her heart.
look, le temps gu it les blessures. Ca va?
don't make me pretend I know what that means.
you know lisa from accounting?
she just got over the worst heartbreak ever.
you know what she said really helped? Spirit-rejuvenating activities.
don't make me pretend I understand that either.
she made a quilt. She took a tap class, went on a cruise.
maybe I should do something like that with mom.
what, you want to float away on a boat two weeks before the wedding?
Yeah. You're right. Crazy. Damn kevin!
you know, he clearly said he wanted to organize our wedding, and I know this thing has tabs, but you can't just hand me a ring binder and then go awol!
look, I still have two fittings for my dress, confirm numbers with the caterer, get programs printed, finalize, order flowers - I mean, kevin was supposed to do most of this.
I can help you. It's fine. - No, you can't. You have your own tab.
well, maybe someone else can rejuvenate with your mom. - Who?
Kitty and seth are still in boston, and if kevin's gonna help anybody, it's gonna be me.
what about justin? - no.
Justin's idea of reviving a spirit - Watching "ghostbusters." Nope.
it's gotta be me.
I don't want to be worried about my mom on my wedding day.
why don't you ask your mom to help you with the wedding stuff? - genius! Two birds, one stone.
I'll have her over for lunch today, - and she can solve this rubik's cube of the seating. - no lunch.
don't want you here at lunchtime.
Luc, you're supposed to make up a cover if you have a surprise.
why would I want to cover it when I can torture you instead?
love it.
the last few days you've been pretty gloomy.
well, I'm all over that. Now I'm just pissed.
that's great. That's great. That means you're progressing through the stages of grief.
Yeah, I'm progressing right up the 5 to the 99.
what do you mean? - I mean, I'm going to drive to fresno and confront brody.
I want him to look me in the face and tell me the truth.
what truth?
the truth about why! Why all of this? Why did he come here? Why did he leave?
Brody wanted me. He pursued me. He cooked dinner for me.
he asked me to go on the road with him. - Okay, mom, but, you know, guys-guys do that.
not brody. Justin, his face would light up every time I came into a room.
I - I could feel his heart beating faster when I got near him.
it was practically jumping out of his shirt.
if he doesn't love me, then I'm crazy, and-and fine! If I am, then-then just commit me!
what?
no, it, it-it- What?
nothing. - Justin?
okay, mom, look, you're... You're not wrong.
he-he does love you.
how do you know that?
B- because there,I mean, there's a chance- Spit it out!
okay, mom, he lied about his blood type.
he what? - Yeah, I'm sorry, mom.
you asked me to spit it out, so I spit it out. He lied about his blood type.
I saw his medical records, and then I went and confronted him about it.
my god. - I'm sorry. Mom, I'm sorry.
Just-okay, just- my god.
are you saying that he's sarah's father? - No, I'm not, mom.
I'm saying that he - He might be sarah's father. my god.
God. This was easier when I just thought he didn't love me.
I know. That's exactly why he didn't want to tell you, mom, or b-because he didn't want to get you upset. So, you know, this may not even be true.
we have to find out. - What do you mean, we have to - what, are you gonna tell sarah?
no.
so what-what are you gonna do, a covert d. n.a. Test, mom? - Yes.- What?
that's exactly what I'm gonna do. - How are you gonna do
don't say anything! Don't say anything! I have to think. I have to think.
I-I have one of brody's baseball caps, - and it's easy enough for us to get something from sarah's house. - No. No, no.
you said "us. "I'm out, mom. I'm not doing it. I'm not gonna do it. Nope.
all right. Fine. Fine. Then I will go to sarah's house all by myself, but I need your help through this, justin. You can't just lay this on me and walk away!
mom, i-i'm sorry. I-i-I 100% should've told you sooner, but brody swore me to secrecy, and I don't even know if I did the right thing by telling you.
Hi, saul. Come in.
I'm sorry to barge in on you like this, but - No, not at all. I was just,
actually, what do you think would cheer mom up more
running the caterer, the photographer, or the printer?
well, you know, your mother's very much like me, so as long as you're standing next to her and smiling, she'd be very happy.
so, honeybunch...
I brought something for you.
so william?
anyway, nora said that I should have it, 'cause william would've wanted me to have it,'cause it's an old guy kind of thing...
and I felt that maybe that would be a perfect thing for your something blue.
thank you. - You're welcome, darling.
you know, when you walked in just now, i...
I miss that.
Yeah, I miss it, too.
anyway, the handkerchief wasn't the only thing I came about.
I wanted to talk to you about something... - sure.
and it's not the most pleasant thing in the world, but, you know, your dad wasn't just a sharp dresser.
he was a sharp businessman, and I think that he would've advised you and luc to sign a prenup.
God. Saul, I can't believe that you just said that.
listen to me, sarah. You worked very hard for this business. It should be protected.
that's sound business advice. You know that.
listen, I know that everybody says that prenups are for second marriages, because you learn your lesson the first time by how badly you get screwed over, and I did with joe, and I did learn my lesson.
I learned not to marry the wrong man, and this time i'm not going to, so there is not going to be a prenup.
okay. - Okay?
Yep.
is there any way she could've gotten on another flight? - I doubt it. We checked.
I think we can safely assume she left the airport as soon as she knew you'd spotted her with the baby.
she ran like a thief, which, of course, she is.
unfortunately, the law hasn't kept up with the science of these 3 - party surrogate births.
to us it's kidnapping, but the police treat it as a custody issue.
that's insane. I mean, she's not even the egg donor. She is not genetically related to that baby in any way.
she lied to us about the miscarriage. She took our money. She stole our baby!
believe me, I know plenty of people in the d. a.'s office. I will find the criminal statute to charge her with.
are you saying that the police are giving up?
let's just say, it's not their top priority. - But that's why we have you.
and I will do everything I can, but I want you to be realistic. After three days, the odds are not with us.
she could be anywhere, and if she's gone back to new york, then it gets more complicated and expensive.
I'm not licensed there. I'd have to hire somebody to do the legwork for me so hire someone. Just keep going.
okay.
I,Got a copy of the new york state birth certificate this morning, - and his date of birth falls right in the correct time frame. - his?
Yeah. She had a boy. His name is daniel.
I, I like it. I mean, in a lullaby kind of way, but I-I like it.
lullaby? Lullaby.
okay, you want something more up-tempo. Have at it, kid.
I thought we were picking together. - Why don't you pick the song?
obviously, I don't know my niece as well as I thought I knew her.
if you don't want to do this, I have a guy that plays the accordion.
this is so silly, me not telling you.
it's like there's this big, fat elephant in the room, and you don't even see that it's there.
what elephant, saul? - exactly.
what? - Come on. Sit down. I want to talk to you. Come on.
okay, here's the deal-I had a talk with sarah this morning, and I suggested that the two of you sign a prenup, and she would not have any of it.
what's a prenup? - Prenup-prenuptial agreement between two people before they get married.
it's just in case...
and she said no? - Yes, she said no.
she has these romantic ideals, which I certainly respect, but I think it's important for people to think practically in ?
that's so sweet that she said no. - Hello? Luc...
Yeah. - You're not listening to me.
well, what do you want me to say? She said no, saul.
I think that you should talk to her about this.
I'm not gonna talk to my bride two weeks before the wedding and ask her to sign a piece of paper that say,"hey, we're probably gonna get divorced.
I can't believe you think I'm gonna steal sarah's money.
why is everybody taking this the wrong way? - There is any other way to take it, saul?
Nora. - hi. Come in.
Luc, I-i,I thought you'd be up in your studio, so I... - no.
saul, how are ya? - Hi. So you-you ventured out?
Yeah. - You know that sarah's at work, right?
Yeah. I know that. I...
how are you? What are you doing?
we're good. We're just actually prepping a rehearsal.
the guys are gonna do this special number for sarah at the wedding.
Yeah, we thought that it would be a great idea to do it now, since who knows how long the marriage will last after that?
I - I'm not gonna keep you at all. I just came by to borrow sarah's... Turtleneck.
turtleneck? It's 70 degrees outside, nora. - I know. It- But it's a-a fashion thing.
I need it for the - all right, nora, stop, please, please.
obviously you came here because you wanted to talk. - No, saul! No!
my neck is cold, and sarah's my daughter. We share clothes.
we've been doing it for 30 years, and some things just don't change.
thank god some things don't change.
no, it can't be that. Can't be it.
Nora, her turtlenecks might be in the,
are you okay?
what did she say?
she said she was in the market for a new hairbrush and wanted to see how ours handled.
but it's a hairbrush. It's not a buick. This is so weird.
what did she do with the turtleneck?
she never got one. She just took off.
Luc, I'm really thinking that maybe I should do this cruise.
think about it-ocean, sunshine, margaritas-a mexican cleanse. This could be exactly what she needs.
okay, but I-i-I don't- I don't see- I can't have her falling apart at the wedding.
this is obviously a cry for help. If I can get her alone, maybe I can help her, just get her to, you know, talk it out or something.
you might be okay with this, but your mother will never agree to take you away from the wedding stuff.
well, then I just - I won't give her a chance.
I will-I will just get everything ready, and then I'll just shove her into a car.
please, luc, come on. Back me up on this.
okay. - Okay! Okay, then.
well, now I am really busy, so I'm gonna hang up on you, but I love you. Thank you.
I really thought I knew michelle.
I mean, I-I liked her. I mean, she seemed normal. I can't believe she would turn into this monster.
Yeah, well, obviously we never really knew her. She could've been planning this from the beginning.
look, I'm sorry to unload this on you, but I can't face telling the family right now, so I need you to cover with mom and everybody until this mess blows over, which might be never.
okay.
are you all right?
Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm fine. I just, Any time you wanna talk, I'm-i'm here to listen.
thank you.
except now.
Hey, mom. - Hi. Listen, I didn't get it!
Luc came in, and I panicked, so you have to go back over there.
I can't. I'm busy. - Where are you?
I'm at kevin and scotty's...
I'm not here. I'm not here. - But they're not here.
well, then what are you doing?
my-my cable went out, so I'm watching, a hockey game. - Wait a minute.
you're too busy watching a hockey game to help me? - Well, it's tied.
Justin, get your butt over to your sister's. I have to go to work.
I will see you here later this afternoon, okay? - Fine, mom. Fine. I'll see you soon.
I'm so sorry to make you go through this charade. - no. It's, it's okay.
what does she want?
she wanted me to go over and watch this movie with her. - She really is lonely.
so lonely.
why are you here?
well, I'm trying to talk to you, like I was trying to talk to you when you left sarah's house, like I was trying to talk to you when I called you ten times on the way over here.
maybe you should take a hint. I'm busy.
Nora, what happened back there? Luc said that it had something to do with a hairbrush.
stop the presses. Nora walker was found holding a hairbrush.
saul, I am dealing with the cesspool that is my life in my own little way, - and you all need to let me do that, all right? - All right.
and if you'll excuse me, I've gotta go.
where are you going now? - I do still have a job.
please go back to rehearsal. I can't believe you left it to come here.
I don't know that I can do that now. I talked to luc about a prenup, and he took it personally.
What?! saul. My god. It's none of your business.
I did it because I wanted to protect sarah.
I did it because I wanted to do what I thought that william would do.
listen to me. You are not her father. What she needs from her family is support.
help her have the very best wedding she can have. Give her your song.
that's what you can do. You can give her your song.
Jeremy's got the lunch rush under control, thank god.
I don't think I could force a smile for another second.
I told justin.
did you make him swear not to tell your family? - Yes, scotty.
I think he understands the gravity of the situation.
What'd he say?
he said he thought she should be in jail for 20 years, minim He also called her a monster.
I don't believe that. She's not an evil person.
Kevin, neither of us knows what it's like to carry a baby inside our bodies.
I'm-I'm sorry. I can't listen to this. We have a son, scotty.
it says here "father unknown," which is a lie. It also says his name is daniel, which is not the name we chose, but michelle's father's name. Our son doesn't know we exist.
what more is it gonna take until you are angry at her?
I am angry, but it doesn't make me feel better to hate her.
I'm sorry. It's okay.
look, kevin, we've gotta pull it together before olivia gets home.
I know.
I forgot to tell you, she texted me a couple of minutes ago.
Really? I didn't get one from her.
well, check your phone. I'm sure she's written something to you, too.
I miss her. - So do i.
bet she's having a great time. - Yeah.
what did she say?
it's-it's not from her. It's, jeremy. He needs me back downstairs.
well, don't worry. I'm sure she's writing you a long text about skunks or something.
Yeah, I'll, i'll s-i'll send her something from downstairs.
Kevin? Where's scotty? - I don't know. What do you need?
nothing. I don't need anything.
I just stopped by to gather up some snacks to bring over there.
the rehearsal. - my god.
you forgot? - Yeah. Completely.
well, it's okay. Don't worry. I'll wait for you. Come on.
y-you know what? Saul, I'm so sorry. scotty and I-we've got a lot going on right now.
I don't-I don't think we can do it. - The rehearsal or the whole thing?
I'm sorry.
both of you?
Kevin, what is more important than your sister?
saul, I don't know. - Okay. You-you-you need to tell me what is going on with you.
I... I'm just tired.
and that's it? That's all you're gonna tell me, that you're "just tired"?
but it's-it's the truth. - I- Okay, I give up. I give up.
Nora won't talk to me about brody, I try to help luc and sarah, and they don't want to hear any of it, and you look like the world is coming to an end, and you tell me that all you need is a nap. Okay.
saul, can you please- N- no. You know what?
you take care of your business. I'll take care of mine.
good. I'm glad you're here. - You are?
Yeah. You can help me sort songs that saul likes a - and songs that are good.
right, because we have rehearsal. - Yeah. I'm glad you're excited.
Yeah, I'm very excited about that. I just,
have to use the bathroom. - Hey, use the one down here.
no, I think I've really gotta use the one upstairs.
I got it. Take a bathroom trip. - yeah. Thank you for the consideration.
okay. Kevin and scotty quit...
what? - You know what? I don't want to talk about it.
we shouldn't do this. - Let's get on with it.
well, justin has an opinion about the song. - I'm so sorry, guys. I can't stay.
what?
guess it's gonna be the two of us now. - Yeah, looks like it's just us.
fine. Let's just pick a song that doesn't suck. - Okay.
come on. It's gotta be in here some - Eureka!
God. Justin, you scared the crap out of me.
what are you doing? - Nothin'.
is that mom's passport?
okay, listen, i'm taking mom on a surprise 3-day cruise to mexico.
that's why I have her luggage...
and her swimsuit and her sundresses and her sandals and her sunglasses, because we're leaving tomorrow.
tomorrow?
she needs to rest, justin. She's gotta recuperate from this whole brody breakup thing.
she's in denial about how much pain she's in, and she's too stubborn to ask for help, so breathe a word of this to anybody, and I will disown you, and you will no longer be my brother.
please don't say that. - my god. Would you look at this?
what is that?
Brody's baseball cap, hermetically sealed in a freezer bag.
Yeah, she's - She's probably just keeping that in case he wants it back.
come on. He must have, like, 50 of these.
preserving it as a keepsake.
Justin, this is creepy. - So creepy.
no, I'm seriously worried.
before you know it, she'll be thumping around in her wedding dress like miss havisham.
can I see... - Justin? Where is it?
w- hi, mom. - hi.
sweetheart, what a surprise. - Yeah. I just wanted to make sure you were feeling better.
I am. Thank you.
feeling so much better.
gosh, yes. Just so much better. I- I really just- I- I've put it all behind me.
practically forgotten. - Mom, stop that.
it's okay to let your anger out. God knows, I'm angry, too.
the way brody treated you - It was unforgivable. It was shameful.
he's-he's a coward. He's a spineless beast, and it's okay to say so.
sweetheart, honestly, could we just drop it?
Yeah, he's not that bad. - Drop it!
Kevin-anyone talk to kevin lately? - no.
no?
no. Yeah. Haven't seen kevin either. - Really?
I... - no. I thought it was just, me he was avoiding.
he hasn't even called you to see how you're doing? - No, he hasn't, and I-I think that's so odd.
I- I really think you should go right over there, sarah, and-and check on him.
no. No, i,I completely forgot. I talked to saul and luc, and he's fine.
wait a minute. What are saul and luc doing talking to kevin?
some legal thing. - god. I can't believe this.
I bet he got kevin involved to try to put pressure on luc to sign a prenup.
you know about that?
I'm so happy I don't know about that.
mom? - You know, I have such a load of paperwork to do. I- if you'll ex - Mom! Mom! - What?
paprika. Do you have any?
I was halfway through making goulash, realized I was completely out.
I love your goulash. - It's goulash, people.
what's your goulash without paprika?
Yeah. Yeah. I- I'll-i'll get you the paprika.
Thanks, mom. You're just such a lifesaver. - Lifesaver.
all right, listen, I gotta get all this stuff out of here. You know, you keep an eye on her, okay?
I am really worried about her. Don't leave her alone. - Okay. Okay.
Where'd she go? - W- she- Something just came up.
thank god. I thought she'd never leave. - Okay, mom. I,I can't take much more of this. I'm...
Justin, you got it! You got it! - Yes, I got it, mom.
you take the hair and the hat and go.
do you think maybe you could them to put a rush on it?
mom, you know what? Trust me.
I'll have 'em put it on our tab.
I'm so sorry, scotty. - You didn't bring daniel.
how do you know his name?
please, scotty, tell me that you did not call the police.
Michelle, did you honestly think we wouldn't try to find you?
that's why I called you.
I know that what I did was wrong, but I thought if you and I could talk, we could figure out a solution without getting the police involved, but, scotty, I can't bring daniel unless I know that I can trust you.
that's pretty presumptuous of you, lecturing me about trust.
I'm so sorry, scotty.
Michelle, I-I believe that you're sorry, but...
you have to let us see him. - I can't. I'm afraid you'll have me arrested.
we won't. I promise. - Scotty, I swear, if you try to take him away, I will disappear again.
I am his mother, and he needs me.
okay, michelle, don't run away, okay? We can work something out.
we care about both you and daniel, and we forgive you.
you really think that kevin will understand? - Of course.
we want what's best for daniel.
that's what you want, isn't it?
I don't have to keep looking over my shoulder anymore?
no.
you're safe.
beautiful. - I think we got a winner.
we do. my god. I can't wait to see her, like, doing the thing that she does, like, - crying and laughing at the same time. - I'm gonna love that!
all right, so you and justin will do melody, and we'll be fine without scotty and kevin, although scotty's a big loss, but kevin is just a killjoy with pitch problems.
we can do without him. - Okay.
okay.
Hi. - Hey, honey. What a surprise.
don't you "what a surprise" me.
I know exactly why you're here. - y-you do?
Yes, and I don't appreciate you going behind my back to put pressure on luc about this whole prenup thing. No means no, saul.
no, no, no, no, no. That's not-that's not it.
my god. Is that the prenup? - This is not what you think it is.
Yeah, you don't understand, sarah.
I - Listen, luc, despite what he might have said, I do not want this.
okay. I don't want it either. It's just that - Good. Good. Did you hear that?
we were trying to surprise you with a song for the wedding.
my god. That is so sweet, and I feel really terrible.
you told me not to come home for lunch... And I totally forgot.
saul, I really-i'm sorry about- it's fine. Listen, you guys have a lot of work to do, so y-you're right. I'm-i'm just gonna go. - I- I really- Sorry, saul.
no. There's no news. I just-I could use some company this morning. That's all.
actually, bro, I'm so sorry. I can't.
it's kinda time-sensitive, but, look, I'm here if you want to talk.
hang on. That's scotty's phone. - You need to get it?
Yeah, it might be olivia calling from big bear.
all right, listen, we'll set something up for later. I'll call you when I'm done with mom.
okay. Bye. Hello. - Hi. It's michelle.
no, this is kevin.
Kevin, I-i'm sorry. I- I told, scotty I was gonna call him today.
well, scotty isn't here right now, so, what did-what did you want to talk about?
maybe I should call back. - No.
no, because whatever it is you-you wanted to say, you can say to me. Where are you?
I - I can't tell you that. That is not part of the deal that I made with scotty.
you made a deal with scotty? Would you like to tell me what that was?
I thought he told you. - No, he didn't, so why don't you tell me, michelle?
Scotty and I decided to do what's best for daniel.
I- I'm his mother, so I need to stay involved. - No, you're not, michelle.
you're our son's gestational surrogate. You're not even genetically related...
so there's no deal that will allow you to keep our baby.
Scotty swore to me that you understood. - No, what I understand is, that is my baby crying, so why don't you tell me where you are before you get into more trouble than you're already in, michelle? - Kevin, don't.
no. Scotty! Scotty! Scotty! - Michelle? Michelle? Michelle? Mich
what is wrong with you? I was setting up a meeting.
I was going to get him back. - Apparently you've already had a meeting!
why didn't you tell me you were negotiating with her?
because I knew you would screw it up, like you just did!
I thought if I showed her a little understanding, she would bring him back safely. Now we may never find him!
you are absolutely right! Absolutely! So good luck living with that!
are you sure you want to open that? - yes.
I want to get it over with.
no.
my god.
wait. Wh-wh- What are you gonna do? I mean, how- How do you even handle this?
I don't know.
is there ever a good time to tell your daughter something like this?
but certainly it's not now, not right before her wedding.
what-what the hell are you talking about, mom? You can't keep something like this from sarah.
Yes, I can. Justin. I can. Well, count me out. Count me out, mom.
I've told you this before. There is no way you can expect me to lie to sarah's face like this.
Justin, please. Don't go all wobbly on me now.
this is not exactly an easy piece of information for me to digest, so if I can, you can.
I mean, what am I gonna say to sarah,"guess what, honey? Surprise!
surprise? You want a surprise, mom?
Sarah's about to take you on a mexican cruise so you can spend 24 hours a day - When did you know about this cruise? - Mom, it doesn't matter when I knew about this!
you should have told me. You don't tell me anything! - Mom, you're missing the whole point of this!
sorry, mom. I didn't know you were here.
Kevin, are you all right? What's wrong?
I'm fine.
what, mom? I didn't tell him anything!
I haven't told anybody any-you know, listen, I'm sick of this!
Kevin, you need to tell mom what's going on. Mom, you need to tell kevin about sarah.
everybody in this family needs to start telling each other the truth!
not now! - Yes, mom, now! Right now! Kevin, mom and I did a d. n.a. Test behind sarah's back, and mom doesn't want to tell her that brody's her father.
and, mom, michelle lied. She did not have a miscarriage.
Kevin has a son, and you have a grandson. Nobody knows where he is.
people need to talk! Why don't you two start?
remind me to never get really emotional news at justin's house ever again.
Yeah, the strongest thing he's got back there is white wine vinegar.
wanna try a little of that? - Sure. I'm in.
poor sarah. - Poor you. Poor scotty.
Sarah gained a father. We lost a son.
don't say that. There's always hope.
mom, I've been through this. I'm scared to hope.
well, then I'll hope for you.
at least there's one bright spot in all this. - What?
well, it seems brody really does love you.
Yeah, like I could take any great pleasure in that right now. - Why not?
maybe you could pick up where you left off.
I don't even know what to think.
but you are gonna contact him and tell him about sarah, aren't you?
I don't know.
mom, I've just spent the last three nights lying awake agonizing over the fact that my son might never know who I am or that I'm his father.
maybe brody feels the same way.
come on. Don't worry. He'll be home soon. - yeah. No, i'm sure you're right.
was he yelling when you saw him? I know he's in good shape, - but I-I worry about his blood pressure. - He was not yelling.
he did look sad...
and so do you, so, scotty, this is your lucky day, because I just off-loaded most of my worry quota, so I'm 100% available to listen.
okay, this is the second time we've lost this baby.
and he's our son. We can't give up on him, but we can't - We can't keep putting ourselves through this.
honey, I'm home. - Where did you learn that?
I have been waiting for you all day. - Hi, uncle justin.
what's up, dudette? - Come here. I want to hear all about your trip.
what do you got there?
Paige said if you give someone a rock from wherever you go that it's kinda like the person was there with you.
that is so sweet. Thank you.
let's go give kevin his.
he's not home, honey.
let me see that. This is, this is the one you're gonna give kevin?
Yeah. - Well, this is perfect. You know why?
Why? - Because this looks just like the shape of his head.
don't tell him.
mom! - i'm in here, sweetheart!
now don't be mad, but I have a little surprise for you.
no, I - No, no, no, no, no. Don't say no. You don't even know what it is yet.
Sarah. - What? the flower's too much? I know.
I'm an idiot. - I know.
what, that I'm an idiot? - No.
no, I know about the cruise.
Justin! I am going to wring his little neck. - We're not gonna go to mexico.
no, wait, mom. Mom, hear me out.
it'll be three amazing days of quality girl time.
We'll-we'll just- We can relax in the sun, talk trash about everybody else on the boat.
we can laugh. We can cry. We can share. Come on. We need this. We c-we can drink!
I'm not gonna go away with you two weeks before your wedding. - Mom, it's handled.
honestly, I want to go. I want to do this. - I don't.
why not?
come on, mom. This is you and me.
there's no excuses, not with us. Come on.
look me in the eye, put a smile on your face, and tell me you'll go.
you're right. No excuses, not ever.
I don't want anything to come between us.
I just always wanted to protect you, but I can't.
what are you talking about?
I need to tell you something.
what? Mom, you're - You're really scaring me.
could you sit down, please?
you've gotta love a family whose response to a paternity crisis and a kidnapping is food and wine.
thank you. - Well, we have to keep our strength up.
Yes, and your chicken is the ultimate comfort food, honey.
Yeah, well, I think maybe this time we're asking too much of this poor little chicken.
no. Never.
Scotty sends his love.
are you guys okay?
Yeah, we'll get there, but, more importantly, olivia's back from big bear, so I think I'm gonna take off.
I want you to take some of these cookies to her.
should we call justin and ask him if he wants to have dinner? - Yeah.
no, I think we should just leave him alone.
I think he's had quite enough family fun for the time being. - Good. More chicken for me.
I can't believe that you still have an appetite.
I know. Dad always used to say that he and I could just eat our way through anything.
come on. Please don't go weird on me. I'm still gonna talk about dad.
nothing's changed. It's-it's just some new information on a piece of paper.
it's like when mom made the gravy from the cornstarch instead of the flour.
the ingredients change, but it's still gravy, okay? You're still my family.
Luc and I are still getting married.
william is still my father, and brody is still some guy I knew for a while.
so you don't want to explore your relationship with him?
no. No. I-I had a dad. I had a great dad, and if I ever need another one, I've got a pretty good stand-in right here.
Really? Even though I sometimes overstep my boundaries?
come on. I love that you worry about me.
Thanks, angel.
the way I see it, brody lied to mom the day I was born.
he made it crystal clear that he didn't want either of us in his life
not then and not now. And you know what, brody? The feeling is mutual.
what are you doing?
I'm trying to find this magazine. I wanted to give it to sarah.
well, you can find it later, because she and luc just left.
what? No, I wanted them to take the leftovers.
well, I threw out the leftovers. - Why?
because there was no chicken left, and nobody would want to eat your gravy after tonight.
I didn't make any gravy. Don't be cute.
Nora, stop with the magazines, honey.
Nora, talk to me.
Brody and I have a child together.
Sarah is our daughter.
part of me would like to call him up and...
tell him.
all right. Then why don't you?
I can't.
it doesn't matter how much this affects me. It's sarah.
her whole identity has shifted.
the comfort she once had in "this is who I am, this is where I come from
has...Suddenly changed.
I have to do whatever she wants, no matter what.
listen to me. I understand everything you're saying, but you're leaving out something very important.
you're still in love with him.
how can that possibly matter?
another masterpiece. - Now it'll be like I'm sleeping by the campfire, but in my bed.
okay, well, it is bedtime, little camper.
Kevin! You missed me so much. - I know I did!
I got you this rock.
I know it doesn't sound like a good present, but really it is.
I will love this forever and call it herman. - Herman? That's a weird name.
you know what else is weird? - What?
sometimes when the wind would blow the campfire smoke where we were sitting...
Cooper said if you close your eyes and say,"i love rabbits. I love rabbits,
then the smoke would blow the other way. I didn't believe it, but it worked.
what? - That's crazy.
speaking of crazy, it's your uncle justin. - He said your head looks like a rock.
did you say my head looks like a rock?
you're where?
can I draw one more picture before bed?
all right. Just tell me. What did mom say now?
she came to the house and put him in my arms and left.
my god.
she just left him with justin.
Brody. Hi.
what a nice surprise.
what are you doing here?
I could say I just stopped in on the way to somewhere, but modesto's not really on the way to anywhere, so...
sit down. - No, I-i-I've got a long drive back to l. a.
this will just take a minute.
you're my father.
Sarah... It's not that simple.
I could be your father. - No, you are.
you left a baseball cap at mom's. It was lousy with d. n.a.so...
there's no "could be" anymore.
my goodness.- Listen, I-i
I didn't come up here for a big tearful family reunion.
I just-I want to make it perfectly clear to you that there is nothing that I want or that I need from you.
just think of me as somebody that you gave up for adoption 40 years ago, and I've had a really nice life...
and I don't want to get to know my birth parent. - please - have I made myself perfectly clear? - Please sit down. Let's talk.
okay, obviously I haven't, but I'm sure it will all sink in as soon as I leave.
Sarah - Just one more thing.
this has been enormously difficult for my mother, so please do not call her.
do you understand? Do not call or bother anybody in my family, because we do not want you in our lives.
good-bye.
my god. - That was so surreal.
how did it go?
he wasn't supposed to get all teary on me.
my heart is pounding.
thank you. Thanks for driving me up. Thanks for coming back.
please, sarah. I mean, come on. I'm here for you.
I- I couldn't get on a plane fast enough. - I don't think I can deal with this.
no, you will deal with this. You will. Of course you will.
I just feel like I'm - Like broken glass inside.
my daniel is eating his carrots my daniel is eating his peas my daniel is eating his carrots so eat some more carrots for me look at him. He is so adorable.
that perfect little nose-I want to eat it right off his face.
I think he's gassy. Yeah, he is.
I love when he uses his sippy cup. - Me, too.
guys, I need to go. - What? Go where?
my god. It's wednesday soccer practice.
I have a client at 4: 00. Can you take her?
no, no, no, I can't take daniel in the car. Remember, I don't have the right size car seat.
the right one doesn't come until tomorrow. - I'll just take the bus.
no. - You're not gonna take the bus.
I took the bus lots of times before I lived here. - Well, maybe, but that was then. This is now.
I'll just cancel my client. - You don't need to do that.
Yes, I do. - I'll go get my stuff.
it's okay. It's okay. You're gonna be okay.
I know. I know. Hey, it's okay.
c'est pas possible. I know I made the reservation.
what do you mean, no record? We booked this room a month ago.
we have guests coming from paris, from - luc, I think we should call sarah.
no, no. That's the last thing she needs right now.
you have to find those rooms, really. I-I - ms. Altamirano?
there seems to be a problem with their reservation.
how are you? - I'm-i'm great. How are you?
this is crazy. I was just thinking about you. - You're kidding.
Yeah, I was staying at this place in the country, and they had a tree house, - and I remember the time you and I - Who could forget falling out of a tree house naked?
right.
sorry. I was just out for a run. Is there a problem? I can...
no, it's just a big family wedding weekend. This is luc. He's marrying sarah.
Hi. Nice to meet you. - You, too.
well, if you reserved a block of rooms, it's gotta be in the system somewhere.
let me go check. I'll be right back. - Thank you.
this girl really, really likes you.
no, there is no way she's giving me another chance, and there is no way that girl is single.
you never know. - Just found it.
20 rooms, paid in advance. - Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you.
is there anything else I can do for you?
no, no. That's, that's it.
it was good to see you, justin. - Very nice to see you, too, tyler.
what? You, my brother, are pitiful.
pitiful?
so, we still haven't heard from mom's cousin lulu.
Lulu never had any manners. At this late date, tell the caterer to cross her off the list.
I talked to sarah, and she said we should set her place just in case she shows up at the last minute.
excuse me. You talked to sarah?
Yes, I talked to sarah.
why wouldn't I talk to sarah?
I mean, we didn't talk about brody, if that's what you mean.
Nora, you can't keep pretending like nothing is going on.
who's pretending? I'm not pretending anything.
Sarah doesn't want to talk about him, so I'm not gonna talk about him.
that's all. - Okay, okay. Whatever.
saul, it's brody. I knew it.
I told sarah she should not have gone up there. I mean, what was the point?
honestly, what was the point? god, saul. What should I do?
I haven't answered his phone calls all day. I
saul, look, you go to the door, tell him I'm not here.
are you out of your mind? I am not gonna lie for you. Just go and talk to him.
I can't. I can't. I - I don't know what to say.
and-and-and sarah will be so upset... And...
saul, if open that door, I don't know if I can close it again.
hello.
what do you want? - Can I come in? Can we talk?
Brody, sarah told you, she doesn't want you in her life.
I have to respect that. I - I can't do it, brody. I...
please just go. - Nora, we have to talk.
please.
okay. Good-bye.
poor sarah. I mean, can you imagine what she's going through?
she's tough. She can handle it.
I don't know. You should've heard her on the phone when she called me.
Yes. yes. You know, aunt kitty took the red-eye, and aunt kitty does not do red-eyes.
and aunt kitty doesn't normally leave her son all the way back east with her boyfriend.
that is how worried aunt kitty is.
look at you. I know. I know. I hear you. Could you be any cuter?
no. I mean, every time I look at him, my heart literally wants to jump out of my chest with love.
looks like scotty.
sorry. - shut up.
you know, I thought i'd feel weird about not being the bio dad.
I totally feel like his father. I mean, not that I need to tell you that.
no. I was so meant to be evan's mother.
you see? It's all about love. - I wish sarah could see it that way.
okay. Okay. Go see your daddy.
you take care of daniel.
and I am gonna go take care of sarah.
wave bye-bye. - Bye-bye.
wave bye-bye. Bye, aunt kitty.
hello. We are here for a marriage license.
fill this out and bring it right back to me. - You got it?
all right. "current address, date of birth...Current last name.
they really should make that multiple choice. - It will be laurent anyway, so...
who knew filling out a form could be this much fun?
last name at birth." Do you think they mean the birth certificate that my father refused to sign or the one he finally did sign after he realized that brody was out of the picture?
are you okay? - boy. This is the gift that keeps on giving.
father's full name. " See, people ask,"what is the definition of irony?
it's right here.
so we're gonna put cooper, paige, and olivia at this table. - Right.
God. - What?
nothing. I remember when we were all at the kids' table.
well, it's a brave new world. - Yep, i'll say it is, in more ways than one.
saul, please don't start. - Okay, okay.
look, mom...
just because sarah doesn't want to see him doesn't mean that you - Yes, it does.
you don't understand because you don't have children.
fine. So we don't have children, but we've both been in love.
all right, look, nora, I-I just want to say something, and please don't yell at me.
I know this is a difficult situation for you, but-but
Yes, it is a difficult situation.
it's difficult... Now, but...
there was this one little moment in time when it all could've been so simple.
I was almost 19 years old. I was a freshman in college.
still think you're gonna get her running? - Moses parted the red sea.
anyway, it better. I'm heading south in a couple of weeks.
watch... And learn.
well, I don't want to stand in the way of any miracles.
no. I'm glad you came, slugger.
I hate when you call me that. - I know.
let me get changed, and we can go grab a bite. - No, I really should go.
I just came to tell you...
william walker, he - Let me guess.
he wants to take you to the richard nixon rally downtown. - No.
he asked me to marry him.
nothing, I guess.
just get back to the car.
I can't believe you never told me that.
so you woulda married brody if...
Nora.
I was saving this for your birthday, but...
since I probably won't be seeing you...
Brody, it's beautiful.
my grandpa gave that to my grandma on the day they left ireland.
are you serious? - no.
my bet is, she just picked it up in a gift shop in reno.
go on. Take it.
so, I guess this is a good-bye present.
so you won't forget me. - Do you think...
I could ever forget you, nicholas brody?
what are you doing here? Are you stalking me?
well, I think I was here before you were. That'd be some pretty fancy stalking.
no. I mean, honestly, what are the chances of me running into you like this?
I never come here. Not ever. - Maybe we were meant to run into each other like this.
you know, destiny, that kind of stuff. - Destiny my foot. It's a random universe.
well, then I hope I see you around sometime.
did you ever get that car fixed? - What car?
that big ol' station wagon you were fixing up to drive down to florida.
no. No, I had to take a bus.
maybe the universe was trying to tell me something then, too.
come over tonight, around 7: 00.
wait, guys, guys, the bar - Plenty of time for that later.
all right. Let's check in.
hello again. How are you?
we have three rooms under the walker-laurent block. Thank you.
Mademoiselle...
Hey. All right. Hey, pierre.
let's, try and avoid an international incident here.
hello. How are you? Okay.
very sweet, pierre. All right. Let's go. Here we go.
here you go, gentlemen. You are all on the fifth floor.
fifth floor. Fifth floor. - Fifth floor.
Cinq, right? - Cinq.
thank you. Sorry.
nothing for, five years and twice in the same week.
well, I do work here. - Right.
excuse mol.
okay. All right. That's enough. All right. Come on, pierre. Nice kiss.
I love you.
I'm sorry. Those are luc's cousins.
si vous avez besoin de que ce soir, demandez au concierge.
je demande a tol.
you, you speak french? - And a little spanish. In my line of work, it helps.
nice of you to see them through the wilds of pasadena.
they seem like they'd be lost on their own.
is it that obvious that I came to see you?
it's pretty obvious.
look, tyler, I'm... I'm not the same guy I was.
I'm sober three years now, and I - justin, you don't have to - No, no, I do. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry how things ended. I'm sorry that they ended.
I - I made mistakes and I'd really love a chance to make it up to you.
what do you mean?
I'd love to take you on a-a date or dinner, coffee, or-or something, just to show you who I am now.
I don't think that's a good idea.
you know, i,I was gonna have them take a cab, but I heard a story today that made me realize it was important to say what I feel, so that...
I'm sorry, and, it was really great to see you again.
drinks? Or whatever you're drinking now that you're not drinking?
when? - Tonight. I get off late, but I can meet you somewhere.
I have a bachelor party to go to, so late is... Great.
great.
all right. I'm gonna...Bye.
Olivia, what were you thinking? This isn't like you.
you intentionally knocked over someone's food tray?
she wouldn't let me sit at their table. - So you knocked over her food?
okay.
so what are we gonna do about this so that it doesn't happen again?
I don't know.
okay. No cell phone, no video games for a week.
Olivia, I-I know this is a confusing time for you. It's confusing for all of us.
none of us were expecting daniel in our lives.
but if you feel like you need more attention, this is not the way to go about getting it.
you need to sign it so I can bring it back to my teacher.
Olivia, be careful!
I will deal with that. - Sorry.
don't swing your bag like that. Pick it up. - You pick it up.
sometimes they taste like the ones that come out of the - no, for the kids, the kids.
the kids have to have the fingerling potatoes. - No, no, no, they're for everybody, - but sometimes they taste like they come from a can- - But it's good for the kids. It's good for the kids
look, maybe we should just reconsider the whole menu, because if we follow the octopus salad with the salmon, it's gonna feel like a-like a- like what?
like a shark designed the menu.
okay, okay, I - I see your point. Let's add steak.
I don't like - No, lamb, lamb. Sharks hate lamb.
what? Honey, sarah, honestly, sweetheart, we can't change the menu now.
for heaven sakes, they caught the fish already.
mom, if sarah wants to change the menu, we will change the menu. It's her wedding.
it has to be exactly the way she wants it. Lamb is on the menu.
okay, fine. Lamb will be on the menu. - Why do you keep checking your watch?
I - I mean, do you not want to be here? Are we boring you?
no, it's just getting late, and I should be getting home.
do you have plans? We were just about to order thal.
thal. Thal. I'm gonna get the - I'm gonna get the menus.
no, I'm-i'm-i'm, you know, tired. We're all tired.
I'm not tired. - I'm not tired.
we went up to modesto yesterday. - I know that, sarah.
I needed closure, mom.
I needed to make it perfectly clear to him that he has to leave all of us alone.
Yeah, well, maybe you just stirred the pot.
why would you say that? - Sarah, you-you told me not to talk about brody.
I'm not, and you are. - Okay. Okay, guys, you know what? Stop.
we are planning sarah's wedding. - Yes.
and we should be enjoying every single minute of it. - Absolutely.- I know. I know.
all right, we're getting the wonton soup. - Fine.
why didn't anybody plan me a bachelorette party?
Sarah. Sarah, come on. Please. This is fun.
we are planning your wedding. We're about to do the playlist.
no. No, no, no. I'm going stir crazy in here. I've gotta get out.
okay. Okay, fine. We'll- L- let's go get a drink- A- a real drink.
you know what would be really fun?
if we crashed luc's bachelor party. - yeah. I'm sure he would just love that.
that is an absolute brilliant idea. - Right?
we could make sure that he doesn't end up with a stripper. - Great.
you know what? I am gonna go up. I'm gonna raid your closet. I'm gonna drive, - so perfect. - Perfect.
well, good. Then you two lovely young women have a wonderful time, and I will, you know, just call you in the morning.
mom, you seem like you're in a terrible rush to get out of here. are - no.
no, no, I'm not in a terrible rush. I'm just leaving.
are you sure brody didn't try to talk to you?
all right, sarah, look, he-he came to the house last night. But I didn't let him in.
God, I specifically told him not to bother you anymore.
Sarah, brody and I have a history together, which includes you.
is he planning to see you again? - I don't know what he's planning.
okay, sorry. Let me rephrase that.
are you planning to see him? Because if you are, I - I would like to know.
I'm not doing anything.
honey, I know this is complicated for you, but it's complicated for me, too.
is it? Because I thought he got you pregnant then abandoned you to play baseball.
I mean, why would you want a person like that in your life, right?
I don't know.
because, mom, if-if you were to choose him over me, honestly, I don't know what I'd do.
I would never do that, sarah, not ever.
have fun tonight.
Thanks, mom.
what did he say?
he said that you're very intelligent and he would love to know you better.
actually, he said he wants to ravage her body all night long.
sex. Those were the days. - I don't understand.
Sarah's not answering any of my texts.
well, I think she's doing pretty well, considering the circumstances.
finally. Olivia and daniel are asleep. - Kevin, why don't you go home?
I'm only doing this for them.
Hey, hey, ma chere.
check this one out. Look how beautiful she is.
they want to go to a gentlemen club.
there's a bar down the block. It'll be full of gentlemen.
no, no, no, no. They want to go to a strip club.
I know. - Okay.
no. - What, did you accidentally delete a picture of tyler?
no. She texted. She's not coming.
well, why don't you go and see strippers with, with luc? I'm exhausted.
I don't want to see any strippers. - Yeah, neither do i.
what's the big deal with this girl? You re-met her like a day ago.
the big deal was, I was in love with her, all right? And when I saw her again, it...
you know what? Whatever. I'm going to see strippers. They'll understand.
Luc, let's go. - Hi.
what? When? No, no, no, no. I'll meet you there.
Olivia just, she just showed up at her old group home.
She-she snuck out. She ran away.
come in, come in, come in, come in. - What are you doing?
I - I parked my r. v. Around the corner.
I just don't want anyone to see us.
this is crazy. Brody, we can't start sneaking around like this.
I lied to my daughter today...
to our daughter, and I don't want to do that. - Brought you some doughnuts.
doughnuts? - Don't you still like the little powdery ones?
Yeah.
I-I try never to eat doughnuts, mainly because I don't want to end up looking like one.
you don't. - Brody...
we all need some time. That's all.
just a little time.
I think we need to figure out how to say good-bye to each other.
is that what you want?
God. - Where are you going?
to fix us a drink.
I. d.s. - Okay, we are rocking this club like we never left.
Yeah. We're gonna leave these wannabe "gen-z" hipsters in the dust.
Hi. - I. d.s.
way to go. Okay, score, baby. - Thank you.
that's funny. You know, when I show you this, you probably will faint.
what's wrong? - shoot.
I think I left it at the county clerk's office.
sorry, I don't have it.
no i. d.no entrance.
okay, honestly, I may not look it, but I'm old enough to be your mother.
it's true. - Quiz me on the '70s.
sorry, it's policy. - Okay. Okay, maybe you could bend your policy for one night.
I mean, clearly- Listen, my-my, fianc? s actually in there...
having his stag party, and we're gonna crash it. So if you could just let us in
ladies, if you don't have your i. d.s, could you please step aside?
why are you being so mean? - no. No, he's not being mean. He's just doing his job.
sorry, ladies. Rules are rules. - Do you know what?
excuse me, ladies. Screw your rules. - Sarah you know-you know the ironic part of this, - if I had my i. d.On me, issued by the state of california... - Sarah.
it would be a fake. - no. Sorry.
because it would say that my name is sarah walker, which it's really not.
I mean, that may not be who I am. - Relax. Sit down over here and relax. Sarah
nobody wants you to prove who you are. y - You know who you are.
that's all that matters. - No, I don't. I don't.
that's the whole point. I have no idea who I am.
do you know what it's like to wake up one morning and realize that your entire life is built on a lie?
I think dad knew that I wasn't his.
Sarah. Sarah, what are you talking about? - No. I'm serious. I think that's why he left me ojal foods.
he was-he was clearly overcompensating and wanted to prove to himself that he loved me despite knowing who I was.
no, sarah, he left you ojal foods because he knows you know how to run a business.
I'm not a walker.
there I said it. It's like the weirdest thing I ever said.
I'm not a walker. You're not my sister. You're my half sister. This is...
Really? Really? I'm not your sister?
okay, so - So I guess then that it wasn't you and me who founded the I hate boys club of greater pasadena and swore with blood that we would never kiss a boy in our entire lives.
and-and I guess it wasn't you who stole dad's car and went out to meet michael klesko and ran out of gas on ventura blvd.
and I guess it wasn't me who-who bicycled out there in the middle of the night with a gas can.
and I guess it wasn't you who held my hair out of my face when I was puking up after chemo, telling me that you loved me, telling me that everything was gonna be okay and-and saving my life. That wasn't you?
you know what? Maybe it was you, sarah. Maybe it was just half of you.
I'm sorry, kitty. This one, you can't understand.
Sarah. sarah, where are you going? - I'm gonna get a cab.
what do you mean, get a cab? You can't...Sarah.
how did you even get here? - I took the bus.
alone at night?
I told you, I used to do it all the time.
Olivia, that does not make me feel better.
Olivia, thank god you are okay. I was worried sick about you.
is she all right? Yeah, I think so.
so who's with daniel? - Uncle saul, but that doesn't matter right now.
what matters right now is you.
Olivia, you are never, ever to leave the house without letting us know where you are going, ever. Is that clear?
okay, sweetheart, we know things have been crazy at home, and that hasn't been fair to you, but we're gonna solve this problem, but we're gonna solve it as a family.
you are as important to us as daniel. Do you understand that?
Why? He was your first choice, and now you have him.
but we found you.
somehow life brought all four us together, and that is not gonna change.
but you don't need me anymore.
Hey, olivia, I think we need you more than ever. - Yeah.
cause, you know, the thing about daniel is, he is in a brand-new home, sleeping in a brand-new bed, meeting all these new people.
does that remind you of anyone?
you're the only one who really knows how he feels.
So...Help us show him that we're his family and that we're not going anywhere... Ever.
do you think you can do that?
no, brody. It's just a mess- A- a-a great big, unfixable mess. - Nora, nora, there's things you don't understand about what happened in the hospital.
of course I understand.
you came to my room and you lied to me so I could be the very respectable... - No.
Mrs. William walker. - No, no. I came to tell you the truth.
well, then why didn't you? - Because I was a scared kid!
you looked at me and my baby and you ran! - And bill-bill-he twisted things around in my head.
what did he twist?
I was in florida trying to be a better ball player than I was, and I got a call from Bill Walker.
somehow I drove from Sarasota to Pasadena in 48 hours flat.
which one's yours?
I don't know.
Hello, Bill. - Brody. there she goes.
off to her 9: 30 feeding.
Sarah Walker.
I think she has my mother's eyes.
but who knows? Maybe they're your mother's.
it's a little hard to tell at this age, isn't it?
well, is that the only way we're gonna be able to find out, her eyes?
because we do have a problem then. - No. There are better ways.
what's your blood type? - B.
well, then we do have a problem, because so am I, and Sarah's AB, compatible with both of us.
if there's a chance that's my little girl, I'm not gonna just walk away.
and how exactly would that work, we all raise her together, some kind of hippie commune?
I want to see Nora.
tell me what room she's in. - I'll tell you.
but before you go in there and claim your 50% chance, think about a couple of things.
do you really want to leave that little girl never knowing for sure who her daddy is?
even if there were some magic way to prove it was you, what kind of life could you give her? You're on the road, following a dream.
I'm building a business...
a real business that'll be Sarah's one day.
you want to take that away from her?
she married me, Brody.
I'm the one she wanted.
she came to me the day you proposed, hoping I'd stop her. - But you didn't.
do you know why she told me about that day an hour after Sarah was born?
because she considered it a mistake
such a huge mistake that she had to tell her husband the truth.
you don't lie to the people you love, Brody.
you want to do the right thing?
go in there and tell her there's no way you could be Sarah's father.
tell her your blood type is O.
room 317.
just past the nurses' station.
if I had done the right thing that day, you wouldn't even be here.
she is beautiful.
william called you?
he's pretty angry. - I bet.
why did you tell him about us?
he's my husband. He deserves to know the truth.
how's baseball going?
okay.
I'm still with the farm team, and they seem to be liking me.
so it's a dream come true then?
Yeah. Yeit is.
I'm so happy for you then.
do you love him?
Yes, of course I do.
I had to say that. I didn't have a choice.
Why?
because William said if I didn't send you away and out of my life, he wouldn't sign the birth certificate...
and he would leave me and my baby girl all on our own.
he--he waited two weeks before he signed it just to make sure you were gone.
we never had a chance.
bill had us both.
puppets on a string.
I was hoping he would leave me and that you would come, and everything would be all right.
so what are we going to do? It could be our baby.
no.
her blood type is AB...
and I'm O.
she can't be my child.
so...
there's nothing tying us together then.
I guess not.
my God.
it seems the world and William Walker were conspiring against us.
Yeah.
well, you know what?
they're not gonna have the last word.
we're still here.
right now. And I'd say, there's a lot to tie us together.
God. I needed that.
you know, there's something to be said for living in denial.
well, you know, it's gonna take time.
why can't you be my dad, Saul?
well, you know, being an uncle has all of the benefits and none of the liabilities.
you know what...
I think is really bothering me is just the question of whether or not dad knew that I wasn't his.
D. N.A. tests have been around for a decade or so.
he could've found out anytime. Stolen my toothbrush and...
it's really unnerving.
well, if he did know, he took it with him to the grave, and we'll never know the answer to that, so...
I just-- I feel so alone in this. - Well, you're not alone.
there's someone you can go to right now if you want. - I can't. I can't talk to mom.
she's already said, it's very complicated for her.
this whole thing, it's just-- it's such a tangle.
you have to talk to her, Sarah.
I don't know what your father knew or didn't know. But I know that your father loved you.
yeah? - Yeah. Okay. You're right.
I am so glad that you called me. I swear, I thought you were gonna be in Buenos Aires.
buenos Aires? Why Buenos Aires? - I don't know. It's far away.
no, I'm...I'm right here. - Okay, good. Saul.
yes? - I'm starving.
can you please go back there and see - if there's any stale bread left for me?
okay. Stale bread coming up.
okay. My behavior was abominable.
I can't believe I just left my sister high and dry like that.
w-wait a minute. Did you say "sister"?
sister"? Like full sister? I've been promoted from half sister?
okay, listen, even if I find out that I was left on the church steps by strangers,
I promise you, I'll never, ever, ever use the word "half" again, not for anything.
it won't be half past 1: 00 anymore. For the rest of my life, it'll be 1: 30.
good.
all right. There's the elevators. I will see you guys at the wedding.
boy, you are working late? - Ye that's why I canceled. I lost my night clerk.
don't worry about that. - You look like you've been working late, too.
Yeah. I've been babysitting drunk, horny frenchmen this whole time.
and trust me, the last place you want to be when you're sober is a strip club.
so what happened? Where's--where's the help?
I lost my night clerk because I told him to go home.
I wanted to be... alone to think.
about what? - It's...
complicated.
Justin - Tyler, why-- why wouldn't you tell me you're married?
because I'm separated.
well, when... When were you gonna tell me?
never.
look, Tyler...
relationships don't always work out. And, you know, I was married, too.
that makes me feel strangely better.
it's been a terrible year.
we don't live together. We barely speak.
I'm sorry. - I should've never led you on. I just...
needed something good in my life again, and I thought...
maybe it could be you.
see, that feels good, doesn't it, huh?
all right, well, I'm off to the office.
to start off, are there any of you that have any particular problems you'd like to tell me about?
don't be bashful. You're among friends.
whoa, whoa, whoa.
let him be, 'cause he's learning how to kind of settle in with you.
a lot of times, rather than helping people with horse problems, I'm helping horses with people problems.
and for a lot of people, they want it all to be fuzzy and warm and cosmic, but it is no different with a horse than with a kid.
you can't always be the kid's best friend.
first you have to be the parent.
a horse like this isn't any different than a kid that takes everybody's milk money on the way to school or beats up old people.
maybe it isn't the kid's fault.
maybe the parent ought to be in jail.
boy, do you feel like a fool and kind of like a failure?
you know? - Aw, it's all right.
people bring a lot of baggage to the table when they come to these.
sometimes they're here for a different reason other than just getting to where they can ride their horse a little bit better.
if you find a way to fit this thing right here, it'll make you better.
it'll make you better in areas that you didn't think related to horses.
good job, buddy.
horses are my life, and because of some of the things I've been through as a kid, I found some safety and some companionship in the horses.
I was just looking for kind of a peaceful place to be where I wasn't threatened, where my life wasn't threatened.
so I have an empathy for horses that when something is scared for their life, I understand that.
he's a pretty nice horse, six years old.
making some good progress, anyway.
just a youngster, just telling him...I want him to be aware of me.
if I slow down, I want him to slow down.
see, if I go like this...I have to practice my old man walk.
so when I'm really old, it might take me an hour to get over there.
he ought to be able to just go with me, as slow as I want to go, and not crowd me.
might be a little slower than what he'd like to go.
if I stop, he ought to stop.
if I go back, he ought to go back, and I ought not to have to beg him.
right now, I walk at a little faster pace, but I'm always testing him to see if he's with me.
when I first seen him, I thought, "What kind of voodoo stuff is this, you know?
how are you getting this done, you know?
he walks into a round pen.
in five minutes, he's got a horse following him around like a dog.
he and I go together.
most of us have a bag of tricks, and Buck has an arsenal.
Hey, boys.
morning.
Hello, how you doing?
good. - Good.
colt starting is always interesting because most of the youngsters have never been saddled, never had anyone on their back or a bit in their mouth.
so there is a lot of fear in both the horse and the human.
the way I do these colt classes, you guys, you'll have to get them exposed to a lot of things that seem perfectly normal to you, but it doesn't seem normal to the horse.
you walk up to them smelling like a Big Mac, you know, or something...
your diet is gonna make you smell different to the horse, and then you're gonna tell the horse, "Don't worry. I want to crawl on you...
in a similar posture to how a lion would attack and kill a horse.
they jump right up in the middle of them, and they reach their front claws around, and as they're biting down on their spine, they're cutting their throat with their claws.
you're asking the horse to let you be in that posture and crawl on him.
and then about the time he says, "All right, maybe,
and then you say, "Oh, oh, one more thing.
I want to strap some hides of other dead animals around you before I crawl on you.
you damn sure have to have some trust.
he's got to believe in you to let you do that, and amazingly enough, they'll let you do it.
now, the first thing that I'm gonna show you is leading the horse by.
step in here. Extend the front over like that.
then he'll go on forward around me.
this takes some practice to get good at.
your horse might be afraid to move.
it's a real trust thing between the two of you.
what's your name, dear?
Martha?
okay, Martha, you want to go the other way.
you got your horse leading by good, just the wrong direction.
that's all right.
tap her.
don't be afraid of tapping her with that flag.
you aren't gonna hurt her.
it would be like you getting spanked with a sock.
there, yeah.
Dave, lead with the right hand.
Yeah, it's in your left hand.
the other left.
walk to the hip.
no, walk to the hip.
you're at the head. That's the eating end.
this is always a hard one for folks.
Pam, that walking on you.
now, your horse is kind of naughty.
you guys make a big old circle around me.
this horse, it knows to get away, 'cause she's pretty fearful.
no, you won't get away.
she said, "I thought I had the angle on you there.
see that head slinging to the outside?
that's unacceptable.
but she doesn't know the difference.
she said, "Well, up to this point, I've had some pretty damn good luck with that technique.
see there where she went to run me over?
that means she's trying to protect herself.
but when I get done, I will not have to close my hand on the end of this rope.
now, I'd touch her here on the neck.
I'd say, "You find out this flag won't hurt you.
nobody's here to hurt you.
one of the things that really struck me was that you always grow up hearing about breaking horses or breaking broncos or something.
there's a whole element of abuse, really, of, it's...
man is stronger than this big animal.
we can break them down almost like Parris Island and a drill instructor, and I think it first clicked for me with Buck at the whole concept of starting.
my early exposure to horses was severe:
tying horses to posts with an inner tube tire so that when the horse pulled back, they would slam back into the post.
it was really brutal, really, truly brutal.
it was heartbreaking.
I didn't know any difference. I was a child.
but I remember crying a lot.
I felt very, very bad for the animals.
so when I met Buck, I was the instant convert.
you can't be a good guy when you leave the barn and a bad guy when you get to the barn.
and if I treat animals this way, do I treat people that way too?
we all know the answer to that.
I met Buck probably at his first clinic that he gave.
if I wasn't at his first clinic, I was probably at his second.
there was a nice change.
and the first time I saw was amazing to me.
l... l... it just blew my mind.
it just blew my mind that it could be done in a way that the horse would cooperate, like the people, and not be scarred up and afraid for life.
I couldn't believe what that man could do with a horse without anything on it.
I mean, he could load horses in a horse trailer without touching them.
I mean, it... the horse has never been in a trailer.
that's phenomenal.
why let an animal live in fear?
why not fix it?
that's pretty good.
you notice how I don't have to have a death grip on the doggone lead rope now.
in this particular discipline, if you want to be great, you have to be a sensitive person.
that vulnerability, that sensitivity to feel the subtle change is what makes you great.
that's why so many of the folks that are really good at this are... you know, sometimes they're tortured souls, you know?
I've seen some kind of dark things in my life, but everybody has a bit of a burden to bear of some sort, so it's all relative.
it's all I ever wanted to be was a cowboy.
I grew up as a trick roper.
that wasn't necessarily by choice, but the first thing is, we were entertainers, my brother and I.
I started doing rope tricks when I was three years old.
you wouldn't think that a three-year-old could be doing rope tricks, but I was doing rope tricks.
I turned professional when I was six.
and as far as I know, we are still the youngest kids to ever get a PRCA card, which was the RCA in those days, Rodeo Cowboy Association.
and we went to fairs and rodeos and performed all over.
but we really enjoyed the attention of the crowds.
we were kind of childhood celebrities, you know.
we were the Kellogg's Sugar Pops kids.
you know, fancy roping takes hard work, plenty of sleep, and good nutrition every day.
here's a good hardworking breakfast.
Oh, it must have been 1970, '71, right around in there.
it was just before my mom passed away.
that was quite a thing.
and all I remember about that commercial, it should have been real fun, 'cause it was a big thrill to all the kids in school that we were on national television doing these TV commercials.
all I really remember about that is that my dad beat us unmercifully for not putting on a perfect performance, and then he drove us home, and, heck, he couldn't even wait till we got home.
he stopped and knocked on us a little bit more.
I remember my mom would drop us off at school.
the last couple of years she was alive, she was working as a waitress in Ennis, Montana, and I would beg her not to leave,
every day, I would cry, because I was just terrified of the fact that I was gonna be five or six hours alone with our dad when we got home from school before my mom would get home, 'cause things always went better when she was around.
but then when my mom died, I knew my life was over as I knew it, and I no longer had my protector.
well, after my mom passed away, my dad really fell apart, and night after night after night, he would come yank us out of the bed in the middle of the night and make us sit at this kitchen table, this oak table.
I could draw the grain in that table for you to this day, 'cause you'd just stare down at the table, because even to just look at my dad when he was ranting and raving in a drunken stupor, he would take that as an aggressive expression.
and one night, I just said, "I'm not gonna get beat up again tonight.
I'm just... I can't do it.
and I made a mad dash outside and not thinking about the fact that I wasn't very well-dressed for being outside in the middle of the winter, 'cause it was cold.
it was somewhere between 10, 20 below zero.
well, damn, then I was really stuck, because I knew if I went back inside, he was gonna beat me half to death, and I just couldn't go back in.
I just couldn't.
we had a dog, and his name was Duke, and I loved that dog.
it sounds real trailer park, I know, but he lived in a 55-gallon barrel with straw in it for his bed, and I crawled in that 55-gallon barrel with that bloodhound.
it wasn't warm, but it kept me from freezing, and I finally, after two or three hours, went back in the house, and he just looked at me like, "Where have you been?
Reata, I can't believe you answered your phone.
where are you?
Oh, cool. What are you doing?
for your mom or for school?
for school.
all right, well, I'll call her back, and then I'll talk to you tomorrow, huh?
okay, sounds good.
okay, love you, buddy.
Bye.
I was watching Oprah.
I don't know if I should admit to that.
but I was watching Oprah, and she said that the greatest aphrodisiac there was for a man was to have a vacuum and to actually run it in the presence of his wife.
so she knows quite a bit, so I thought, "Well, I'll... it can't hurt.
you know, you never know where you're gonna get some information.
Hey, you.
gonna put the smaller one in the back.
there's not quite as much room.
we got 27 years in now.
Yeah, 27 years.
I get to where I don't even worry about what day it is.
all I know is, it's just all in four-day intervals for me.
I don't know; you get in a rhythm by doing this, and you... oh, after just a few days of being somewhere, you're kind of ready to go to the next one.
Hey, Mary, it's just me.
good. What are you doing?
got the clinic done here. Didn't make anybody cry.
talk to you later on.
all right, Mary, I miss you.
I do this 40 weeks out of the year.
for the rest of the year, you could say, "Where are you gonna be on such and such a day?
and I could tell you exactly where I'm gonna be till about Thanksgiving.
Walkertown, North Carolina.
huntsville, Alabama.
limerick, Maine.
Bay Harbor, Michigan.
cedar Rapids, Iowa.
Longmont, Colorado.
Thermopolis, Wyoming.
bend, Oregon.
bozeman, Montana.
Libby, Montana.
Yeah, there's some loneliness.
you know, it's truck stops and driving late at night and just trying to get to your next spot, and you're alone, you know?
that's when you really miss your family, and you want to be home, and you think of what it would be like just walking barefoot across the living room and going to bed.
but there is no way that's ever gonna be anything other than what it is.
how are you? - Hey, how are you?
she's gonna make me a Manhattan.
and I can make more than one if somebody wants one.
they're in the back.
were you at that clinic in Ellensburg when it was so cold, when Bob Blackwell...
Yeah, that was 17 years ago.
that was my first clinic with you.
and they brought them in, these horses in, in stock trailers, literally.
they opened up the door, and they went into the round pen, and there was 15 or 17 colts, and he roped every one of them.
a mutual friend invited me, and I was pretty skeptical about the clinic and the approach.
and I went pretty convinced that I wasn't gonna appreciate anything that I saw.
and then he started working with all these babies...
and I was blown away.
I mean, I couldn't believe what I saw and the rapport that he had with them.
you know, it just kind of stopped me in my tracks.
my whole life has been encompassed around Arabian and half-Arabian show horses from the time I was a little girl.
I was showing horses and thinking that everything was cool, the way I was doing things and the way I saw things being done, and I'm proud of a lot of those prizes that I won, but I'm equally ashamed of a lot of them too.
horses are put into forced positions that they're neither mentally or physically prepared to handle, and these practices aren't used nearly as much now as they were years ago, but the horses would be put into hock hobbles that would go from the hocks up through the snaffle and back down so that every time he took a step with his hocks, you know, it'd take ahold of his face to teach him to stay into that real infixed position.
but there's no connection for the horse.
there's no understanding of that except for it hurts.
so they're gonna stay away from those pressures and learn to infix themselves into those positions because... through intimidation.
and I just thought that that's the way you did it.
and that's what the horses had to do to be show horses, and you don't realize how unjust it is until you...
until someone shows you a different path.
come on.
let's say the horse needed you to be firm.
there's a difference between firm and hard.
let's say I needed to take ahold of the horse with 20 pounds.
the way I go about getting to 20 pounds is gonna have a lot to do with whether you're successful or not.
hold on to that.
I'm gonna pull on you some, so don't let me get it away from you.
okay, so close your hand on that, or it's gonna come away from you, and don't give to me.
let's say I needed to pull on this horse about that hard.
the way I took ahold of you wasn't really offensive, and wouldn't make you afraid.
but let's say I was abrupt and had hands like a butcher and I took ahold of the horse like that.
now, I'm pulling about like what I said, but it's how I got there.
be ready.
it's how I got there that could be rude to the horse.
now, watch Robert closely.
I'm just riding with bad hands.
Oh, you braced.
I didn't hit you. Why'd you do that?
he's protecting himself.
once I've done this a few times with him, he'll brace all the time like that.
see him brace? You can't help yourself.
and I'm even telling you you're gonna do it.
and you still can't help it.
but if I took ahold like this, you might give to me, and then I'd give to you.
but it's the way I go about it, and whenever you're ready, maybe you'd give to me, see.
otherwise I'll just wait here.
nobody's gonna get any lunch today.
when you started to soften, so did I, and you both feel together.
if you were real sensitive to me when I feel of you here, you'd already be giving, see?
that means something to my horse.
that's what a soft feel...
that's what I do to get a soft feel right there.
and I want you to get at least a mental picture of what a horse operating on a feel is to where hopefully it looks good to you, that you'll want that, that you'll strive for that.
so this is one example of a feel, see.
I could even take on this rope right here like this, see.
that's operating on a feel, see.
I could do this and say, "Get back.
and I could do this and say, "Get over.
without touching him, your energy moves the horse.
most people think of a feel as when you touch something or someone and what it feels like to your fingers, but a feel can have a thousand different definitions.
sometimes feel is a mental thing.
sometimes feel can happen clear across the arena.
that's what I'm looking for there.
sort of an invitation from the horse to come to you.
it's not always physical. Sometimes it's mental.
when you have the physical working for you when you're younger, you ride with 90% physical and 10% mental.
but if you could learn how to use 90% mental and 10% physical, you'd be better off.
I'm looking for the horse to learn how to follow a feel.
it's supposed to take that much.
little bit more. There.
left, right, left, right, left, right.
everything is a dance.
everything you do with a horse is a dance.
now I'll open him up a little bit here.
problem is, when a lot of folks can't get a horse to operate on a feel, they'll get a little more bridle, get a little more shank on it, drive a spur through the horse's shoulder, then tie his head down, then get a bicycle chain over his nose.
I mean, it doesn't stop.
it becomes medieval.
now, I'm gonna tip the life up in him here.
we're moving on a feel.
you know, a horse is pretty sensitive.
a horse can feel a mosquito land on their butt in a windstorm.
every movement you make on a horse, there is a perfect position of balance that takes no energy from the horse.
he doesn't feel like he is pushing you along with him or dragging you along with him.
he's built to fit a horse, you know?
God had him in mind when he made a cowboy, you know?
I've never actually seen him whisper a horse, but I guess if there's a horse whisperer out there, it's Buck Brannaman.
I don't know, you know?
originally, I got connected to The Horse Whisperer through Nick Evans, and he said, "I'm researching some characters for my book, and I'm trying to find a way to bring this character to life.
and I was doing a clinic in California, and kind of a hippie-looking guy came up, and he said, "I'm a movie producer.
he said, "I was wondering if you could meet with me and Bob.
I said, "Bob?"
in my business, artificiality is part of the business.
you look for authentic people.
and so when I met Buck, my first thought was, "Well, what the hell is this?
a guy walks into an office in Santa Monica.
he's got a big hat on.
he's got his vest and so forth.
he looks like he's got a costume on, and I thought "Oh, my God, you know, what's..."
and his compatriot who was with him, the same outfit, and I thought, "Oh, jeez, what have I gotten into here?
and then the etiquette, the politeness, the humanity that kind of came off real quick and kind of erased that, and then we sat in the office for about an hour and a half and talked about things that were authentic, and so I realized that I was really dealing with what I would call "the real deal."
no-nonsense guy, no-nonsense, you know, whether with the animal or people.
he was an advisor that I brought on that slowly worked his way into the core of the filmmaking because he just knew more.
so Buck contributed everything as a model and also as a player.
I used him as a double.
so he was a huge part of the fabric of the film, and he was able to do things that the hired trainer could not do.
there was a scene that Scarlett was supposed to go into the stall with the horse, and it was her first time being near the horse since the accident, and the action for the horse was, he was supposed to sort of paw the ground and show a little aggression and then come to her and respond to her and more or less put his head in her arms, and it was an, "Aw, gee," a real touching scene, and they couldn't get the shot because the horse was a trick horse, and they are trained to not take their eyes off the trainer.
the horse nuzzled the wood. The horse nuzzled the frame.
the horse nuzzled the boots of the trainer but wouldn't nuzzle Scarlett.
the meter was ticking, and, you know, time is money and all that stuff.
so I was going into a panic.
they said, "What are we gonna do?"
I said, "What do you mean, what are you gonna do?"
he said, "Well, we never got that shot."
I said, "Yeah, we sure spent a long time at it too."
he said, "Yeah, eight hours. You got any ideas?"
I said, "Yeah, why don't we use my horse, Pet?"
and at first, everybody said, "Well, you know, you don't understand, Buck .You know, we use Hollywood trick horses for this because they're performers, and they can do things on the mark so we can pull a focus on a certain place, and you just don't understand that."
"we don't... not downplay your thing, Buck," "but it's like... but Pet," "he doesn't know how to work on a mark."
he's not an actor.
I said, "No, he's a horse."
I said, "What do you have to lose?"
so I dinked around with my horse and got him where I could lead him by front foot with a rope on him, and I got him where I could jiggle that rope, and he'd paw the ground on the mark.
so he came up, and he just put his head right in her chest, and she wrapped her arms around that horse, laid her head on his forehead, and everybody was crying.
God, within 15, 20 minutes, it was done.
so Buck played a greater role than a lot of people realize.
he contributed everything.
there was a humanity and a kind of gentleness of spirit that I adopted for that character because of Buck.
when I saw the finished product, he looked good.
I told him, "There is some potential there, Bob, if this movie thing doesn't work out for you, I think I could probably get you to where you could make a living doing this."
this one you want me to take right here?
Yeah.
okay, Reata.
I might have you check on Charro and see if he's eaten.
okay.
I've been traveling with Dad during the summers, usually from end of June till end of August.
it's been two months since I've seen my dad.
my dad's on the road nine months out of the year, and it's tough, but I'm kind of used to it now.
I mean, I've been doing it since I was... well, forever, so...
heads up.
we've got a few sacks of feed to schlep across here.
Reata, you and Nevada need to go wrap up all the sound.
Yeah, Nevada's going with me.
my partner in crime.
I just started traveling with them last year.
I spent a month with them.
I think we're helpful to a point.
sometimes maybe we're in the way, 'cause he has, like, a way of doing things, you know?
what are you doing?
bring you breakfast.
what is it? - Sticky buns.
I might just have one.
I don't want the...
that'll do me.
Thanks, mate.
so I guess you got a lot of songs transferred for me on my iPod.
traveling with Dad, it can get pretty stressful sometimes just because he is, like, a travel Nazi.
make sure you plug that little deal... give me that.
cause he has his own way of how he does everything, and we kind of mess up the process sometimes.
Aw, Reata.
Aw, you put the top on backwards.
but then when it comes to, like, cleaning pens and saddling his horses and stuff like that,
I think he kind of appreciates us.
how'd you do?
nasty.
Hey, Reata. - Yeah.
bring me back a sack for trash when you...
after you feed.
sure.
I ride every summer.
I usually take one of my horses.
step up in here and get a dally on and stop my horse.
I get a lot... I learn a lot on it.
every clinic that we go to during the summer is different.
the horses are different, different people.
there, you followed by feel.
the horse world can be pretty cliquey.
well, we don't go for cliques around here.
there are probably some people here that it's just pittance, pocket change for them to come, and some of them save all year long just to be able to go to this clinic.
put on my Madonna microphone.
how we fixed here, Maggie?
you getting his chin down a little bit?
you want to release as quick as you can.
he's gonna give in a second.
there, there.
pet him. That's the way.
my daughter, she had a hard time releasing.
I'd say, "Reata, your arms," and she'd go like that.
spread your hands a little more. Get them a little lower.
there you go.
nice.
you want that horse to be an extension of you, but then you don't control your legs.
you think you're just gonna control this part of the body.
this is a body. The whole thing is a body.
if all of you didn't have a horse here and I was trying to talk to you, wouldn't that be weird if you said, "Hey, I don't have control of my legs.
all of a sudden, they just tear off, and you're like, "Oh, jeez, sorry.
waiting on the coffee.
he's got to have his coffee.
black, I'm sure that comes as a big surprise.
he has the coffee, and then he lets down, and it kind of smooths out.
go to Sheridan, Montana.
Sheridan, Montana, is there, and we're up here, probably seven hours.
not too long.
Yeah, it's a great bunch of folks at this clinic.
good to see you. - Good to see you.
welcome to Montana.
a lot of them, I've known since I was a kid.
some of them, I went to school with.
some of them, I went to school with their parents.
it's like... it's coming home for me here.
it's gonna be a busy week, 'cause Mom's gonna be in Sheridan.
Hi.
how are you? - I'm good.
how are you?
I haven't seen Mary for a couple of months.
Hi, Dally. Hi, buddy.
so it's been an awful long run.
Mary, she doesn't like to travel as much, but I'd sure like her to go with me a little bit more, and she may go with me a little bit more once Reata goes off to college.
so this is Twyla, Rudy. This is Dally.
Oh, Dally. - Hey, Rudy.
Rudy's grown a little bit since I left.
I don't know how many dogs you need before you have enough dogs.
they worked their way up the food chain past me, but my wife loves them, and I love my wife, so if it makes her happy...
makes me happy.
I actually do like traveling on the road.
it's fun. It's really fun.
I mean, you get to meet a lot of different people and see a lot of different beautiful places.
like, this place is amazing.
but I like staying home too, though.
okay, are there any of you that have any real problems with them that you'd like to kind of mention?
he runs me over.
he runs you over?
okay, lovely.
well, a baby like that, they're not trying to be pushy.
they might be sort of crowding you just a little bit because they still might be scared.
they kind of think that maybe if they get real close to you, they'll get some comfort.
and the big thing, you guys, is, don't be overly critical of them, 'cause they're just babies.
if he feels like you're angry at him at all, he will shut down.
I don't know where Buck draws his real personal strength from, because he's lived through a lot.
I mean, it...
he came out of such dire straits and, you know, was virtually, I think, plucked from his home in the middle of the night sort of a thing.
it's a real hard story to tell, 'cause, you know, you see him now, and, you know, I don't even think about that.
ace was real hard on those boys.
you knew there was something wrong there maybe, but you weren't for sure what.
you know, he kept it hid pretty well, I guess, until the point when Coach Cleverly...
you know, seen his back.
Ah, that's a hard story to think about.
Bob Cleverly was a typical football coach that you loved but feared too, you know, and he'd actually made Buck shower in PE, and when he didn't want to shower, you know, and he told him to, you know, get undressed and get in the shower, you know, as soon as Buck started taking his shirt off, he seen the whip marks, and the thing of it is, is, you know, he just basically told him, he said, "Your dad will never beat you again.
"I'll make sure of that," you know.
and then that's when Johnny France kind of started the ball rolling to get Buck and Smokie to a safe place.
I was present when the boys were forced to disrobe, and on their legs and their little buttocks were these big whip marks where their dad had beat them.
when I looked at these little boys, I said, "No, we'll have none of that.
I took them to the Shirleys.
they were two frightened little boys, but it wasn't too long before the two boys were just...
they just turned into Shirleys.
my mom had...had just died.
and she was very loving, wasn't she?
Yeah. - She was a very loving lady.
so she became my new mom, and, boy, that was something I really needed.
sleep good?
I did.
they have a wonderful relationship, and she's a guiding force.
may God bless you and watch over you.
there's no sense that, "Okay, you're raised. You're gone.
I mean, she's their mother.
she's truly their mother, and I think Betsy raised something like 23 foster sons.
I mean, all boys, all boys.
when our kids were little, it was like a zoo, and it was every man for himself and survival of the fittest.
my motto that's stood me in good stead is, "Blessed are the flexible, for they shall not get bent out of shape.
my foster dad taught me how to shoe horses.
I was 12 years old.
when I first went to live with them, he told me, "Kid, you might not ever amount to much, but you better learn how to ride a colt and shoe a horse."
and then you'll always be able to eat.
even if you can't get much of a job, you'll always be able to eat.
so he taught me how to shoe a horse over a period of time.
there were so many things that I learned while I was with my foster parents.
when I first got dropped off at the Shirley ranch, I was so terrified of men, and my foster-dad-to-be, he pulled in in the truck, and, gee, he was tall, 6'4," just looked like he was made out of rawhide and barbwire
but he walked right up to me, and he said, "You must be Buck,"
and I shook his hand, but I couldn't even speak.
it's real; you can be so scared that you can't say anything.
no words come out.
I just sat there, and my little knees were just about knocking together.
I was a little guy.
and then he spun around, walked back to the truck, and opened the door, and my heart just stopped.
because it's almost like a colt that's had some trouble.
you don't have to do too much to make them suspicious, just even move in a little bit of a way that they don't understand or can't comprehend, and that quick, they...
they think they need to save themselves.
so when he went back to that truck and opened the door, I didn't know what to do.
scared me to death.
he came back, and he threw me a pair of buckskin gloves.
he said, "Here."
he said, "You're gonna need them,"
and, gee, they were just beautiful, and they fit me perfect.
I was so proud of them.
and he looked over at the ranch truck, and he said, "Get in.
so we got in, and he always had fencing tools in the truck.
so we took off, and we built fence all afternoon, pounding steel posts into rocks and pulling wire, but I wouldn't wear those gloves.
there was just that... that took act of kindness, just giving me something like that.
Oh, gee, it meant so much.
I didn't want to get them all tore up, so I kept them in my pocket, and I just worked with the barbwire with my bare hands.
and he realized that I didn't need someone to just pity me for what I'd been through.
he knew I just needed something to do.
I needed a job to do.
and that's when things started to head in the right direction for me.
so I learned that about the horses years later.
I thought, "Oh, yeah."
that's kind of what Forrest did with me, come to think of it.
you see the expression on that horse?
it moves, but he's crabby.
flagging the tail, it's annoyed.
it's like asking your kid to go take the garbage out.
they take the garbage out, but they flip you the bird on the way out of the room.
it's without respect, and respect isn't fear.
it's acceptance.
he bucks whenever I saddle him...
not when I saddle him but when I get him to go through transitions.
I've never started a colt ever in my life.
I've always been around really well-broken ones.
so this is my first shot at it.
and he's got a little bit of Buck in him.
so you must be Bill.
I am Bill.
that's why I asked Bill Seaton to ride him, 'cause Chief needs a confident rider for that first ride.
I bought Chief about a year and a half ago.
he was one.
he had never had any human contact.
born out in the field, wasn't touched, handled, nothing.
it's just a rodeo and disaster waiting to happen.
it's not his fault.
he's like a kid that just didn't have any good parenting.
he just doesn't know what's to be expected of him.
I want to check your horse out.
if you're gonna do anything shocking, I'd rather you did the shocking stuff right here than when you're on their back.
right here.
step over.
he says, "Well, I prefer you beg me."
not a chance.
there's the good deal offered.
there's not so good a deal.
that's the thing with a horse.
you can't just love on them and buy lots of carrots.
bribery doesn't work with horses.
no different than trying to bribe a kid.
all it does is make a contemptuous, spoiled horse.
but you don't want them afraid of you.
you can be strict, but you don't need to be unfair, and like I say, it's not personal.
I don't feel any different about him than I do my own horse I just stepped off.
we're not mad at you.
one of the biggest challenges of a horseman is, is to be able to control your emotions, because a person might be quick to get all mad.
there you go.
that's better.
let's go this way.
I said that way.
you allow a horse to make mistakes.
the horse will learn from mistakes no different than the human.
but you can't get him to where he dreads making mistakes for fear of what's gonna happen after he does.
sometimes I'll just move this flag around, and I don't want him to be afraid of it.
I'm saying just live with that.
now we'll start again.
there's a change.
Attaboy.
buck says when you start handling horses, your own personal issues start coming out.
and I was so anxious to see the saddle on Chief,
I rushed him to it, and now I've built...
I feel like I've built this fear and this insecurity in him.
but see, I'm an insecure person, so they... horses, they mirror you.
they can't lie.
there. Good boy.
horsemanship, fine horsemanship, becomes a way of life.
it's not about controlling the horses.
it becomes how you treat your spouse, how you treat strangers.
will you give people a chance, just like you give the horses a chance?
it becomes how you discipline your children.
you know, you can discipline and discourage, or you can discipline and encourage.
you can say, "I see you tried that. What do you think you should try instead?'
tentative, but he tried, and I'd pet him with this.
you can just leave him be for a little while.
just kind of hang with him and let that soak in.
that's a more building sort of approach than, "That's wrong. That's wrong. That's wrong."
all right, it's time.
go on out that end. Go into the round corral.
we're gonna go for a little ride here.
how you getting along, Bill? - Great.
looks pretty good.
sure does, doesn't it?
see if you can get on a lope.
good. Well done.
coming through. - There you go.
way to go.
that should have felt pretty good to you, Bill.
it did.
kind of where you end up your ride on a horse is so important, you guys.
it's a little bit like when you guys were younger and you were dating.
that last two minutes of the date can be a real deal breaker.
with these horses, it's the same thing, you know?
you got to quit on a good note.
that was a good day.
all right, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
raspberry and peach cobbler, which would you like?
going for raspberry.
Oh, that one?
Hey, Buck, why don't you do some rope tricks?
this is kind of a tricky one here.
this is the move I used to always do for Mary when I was trying to trap her.
he was just a very ordinary boy, didn't show signs of early genius.
Thanks, Mom.
there was one point he thought maybe his trick roping would be his avenue to success, but when he first saw Ray Hunt doing his thing, he was so fascinated, he focused on that.
pretty much anybody that's been involved in the horse world knows Ray Hunt, and Ray brought this style of horsemanship to the world.
Tom Dorrance was sort of the godfather of all of this.
Tom Dorrance taught Ray Hunt.
ray Hunt taught Buck Brannaman.
that's kind of the lineage, as it were.
I met Ray right after I got out of high school.
one of my teachers told me about this guy that could start a horse and get on him in just a few minutes and ride him around with no bridle on, and I thought, "Right.
I'd grown up on a ranch.
I was pretty punchy.
rode a lot of colts and a pretty fair bronc rider for a kid.
I thought, "Yeah, another song-and-dance man, some horse show dude."
I had an opportunity to go get this cowboying job at a place called Madison River Cattle Company.
they said, "Well, in order for you to get hired, you're gonna have to go talk to the manager, and he's at a Ray Hunt clinic."
and I thought, "Aw, great. Here's this Ray Hunt guy again."
so I go into the fairgrounds, and Sat about as far away as I could so that I could show that I was not interested in this.
and then in came Ray Hunt.
I saw him do more things with a horse in a couple of minutes than I'd ever figured anybody could do with a horse.
he worked with a colt that was pretty touchy, and I had been around enough to know what a touchy horse looked like.
you could tell the horse truly understood what he was expecting of her.
he could take those feet anywhere he wanted.
they were his feet.
it was just an extension of him.
it was like a beautiful dance.
I took right to it as soon as I saw it.
I thought, "I don't even know what it is, but whatever it is, I need this."
so that was the beginning for me.
I went to Ray's clinics, if not every week, every other week, for the next four or five years.
I was right down in the arena hanging over the round corral watching this guy lift a rein or move a foot.
I might not have known all what he was doing, but I was seeing it.
we got to be very close, and even though he said it wasn't that important that I pleased him or that people pleased him.
I looked for his approval, you know, the same way you would a father figure.
and later on, when Ray passed away, I shed way more tears for him than I ever did for my dad.
now, you guys don't have to ride like Ray Hunt or Tom Dorrance, but that's the choice I made.
first clinic I ever did, I probably wasn't, you know, a real effective teacher.
I was a pretty decent hand by then.
I could get a little bit of stuff done with a horse.
but I'm sure I just sounded like I was parodying Ray Hunt.
I didn't have anything original of my own to really talk about, and I was so introverted at the time, and I felt so uncomfortable.
I committed right then that I was gonna do enough little local clinics to conquer that.
buck has worked so hard to overcome his shyness.
the clinics were so small when he first started, he would offer to haul the horses for free just to get 'em to go to his clinic.
and he couldn't have eye contact with you.
I mean, he was very shy, and to see him work that hard to overcome that...
and I think it amazes him to this day that people want to even listen to what he has to say.
ray used to say that he thought horsemen were born, but an average person can be extraordinary at this.
but if you don't have any guts, if you don't have any try, you'd be damn lucky to be ordinary.
you're gonna find out what it's like to actually use a horse and how nice they can be when they get used.
to work a horse properly on a cow, that's the coolest feeling there is.
let the games begin.
I want you to be able to learn things and do things in real life if you were on a ranch where you had a job to do.
it's one turn and then a race.
one turn and then a race.
give him a job.
figure out how to build on the horse's pride.
make him feel good about himself.
and I wasn't just talking about the horse.
Reata, that's good.
nice, nice.
Mary.
as long as you can stay between your cow and the herd, you're in charge.
dang, out. I'm out.
see what happens when you're married to him?
Britt, you're up.
go move that cow.
there's really nothing more fun than chasing cows at top speed and just trying to react.
that's crazy fun, but that's not really what you're supposed to do.
so it's this constant battle to bring it back to some place that's controlled.
stop.
see, you turned without stopping.
you know, that's the other half of why this is a really interesting thing, 'cause it carries over into every other aspect of your life, and I think it's made me a more resourceful and balanced human being on top of just less likely to get killed on a horse.
I love working cattle with my dressage horses.
I think it's fabulous for them, because dressage is a sport where there are really fine ballet-type movements that you're asking the horse to do.
it gives meaning and purpose to the dressage work, and then when you take that purpose back into the dressage ring, the horse says, "I'm practicing working cows,"
and it makes sense to the horse, and then he will do it with a greater joy, because it has meaning to him.
it's not simply an exercise.
and I think that dressage work gives the cow horse skills that even cowboys could use.
there you go.
horses get discouraged by riders who shut the doors, and Buck's really good at opening doors.
and you get to artwork or anything else that you do, you start to look at it for the open doors, and then you learn how to walk through those.
you guys want to throw a few heel shots?
I knew that Buck was really a special guy, and because of his background, which I learned about, and the abuse that he had suffered as a kid, it was even more impressive that he could come through that abuse and, rather than repeating it, that he went the other way and decided, "I'm not gonna have that in my life."
bill, I'll start with you first.
what's your stage name?
Smokie Brannaman. - Smokie Brannaman.
and how about you, Dan? What's your stage name?
they call me Buckshot, and I'm seven years old.
well, who taught you to perform?
our father did.
and that's Ace Brannaman, right?
did he ever do this type of thing?
was he... did he ever do...
the way my dad treated me when I was little, the way he approached us as kids...
we've arranged a short demonstration, right, fellas?
I wouldn't attribute any of my positive virtues to my dad in any way whatsoever.
I know you're not supposed to hate anybody, but the hurt that he caused me, I never really got over it.
so I live in the moment.
I like to live in the moment.
you worry about yesterday or last week or 20 years ago, it's not gonna work out too good for you.
you can't live in two places at once.
you know, I mean, you never forget, but you don't have to keep living in the past.
I mean, there's a whole bunch of things I learned from all the dark stuff that happened to me.
there's a hell of a lot of things I learned.
now, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to anybody, but it made me what I am.
Yeah, it got a little warm there for a while today, didn't it?
thank goodness my daughter...
she's never gone through anything like that, and now she's almost grown up, so...
you can just saddle them inside the round corral.
I think if a kid is living in an environment like I was when I was little, sometimes the way you protect yourself is, you just really don't communicate with anybody, and you try your best not to be noticed, and you just sort of withdraw, and you'll see a horse sometimes that they've been mashed on by somebody to where you just look in their eyes, and they look like they're dead.
yet that's the time when you try to encourage your kid to be outgoing and gregarious and be able to talk to not only other kids but adults.
then just see if you can lope him right out of his tracks, 'cause that's what you might have to do if you're gonna jump out of your tracks on a cow or something.
you know what I mean? There.
he got it.
he kind of got it done in spite of you, didn't he?
dang it.
we'll make a cowgirl out of you yet.
you're only doing this so you can laugh.
Reata and I are an awful lot alike.
thank goodness she kind of has her mother's looks.
mentally, she's a lot like I am.
you know, Mary'll say, sometimes in frustration, "She's just like you,"
and I think, "What's the downside to that?"
but she may not be seeing it just that way at the time.
and I look at her and the way she's developed, and I think, "I probably could have been that way when I was her age.
that was in there all the while.
do it again.
there.
that was a little better.
Yeah, I could feel it.
buck, either before you get settled or when you get settled, you signed these books last year, and I need a translation.
it's Spanish or Latin.
Latin.
gentle in what you do, firm in how you do it.
Yep. - Good words.
how are you, Charlene? Nice to see you.
it's good to see you.
I wanted to tell you I was all signed up to ride with you, and a couple of weeks before the clinic, I found out I'm having a baby.
well, all right. - Good for you.
I always learn even when I'm watching.
good, all right.
okay, you guys can come on over near the round corral here where you can get a good chance to see.
I'll work with this one first here.
evidently he's a little naughty.
I guess you can see a little disrespect there, huh?
he had to come up and stick his nose right in my face.
so I'll work with him, and we'll see the same things on about all the colts, but...
Dan?
this guy's a paint, and he was an orphan as a baby, and he was oxygen-deprived, apparently.
Dan, do you want to...
which way do you guys want to bring him in?
I'm gonna talk to Buck, see if he wants him or not.
he may want to...
cause that horse might hold up the whole progress of the whole class.
so wait until noon.
so he might want to wait until, yeah, when it's convenient for Buck.
maybe even after the whole deal. I don't know.
I think we have a problem child we have to work yet.
all right, you can bring that one on in, Dan.
they make it sound like they're bringing in a Siberian tiger.
was he hard to catch even in the trailer, Dan?
he just kind of wanted to be a little aggressive in there.
bite maybe. - Uh-huh.
just a lot of threatening, you know?
how old is he?
he's three.
Uh-huh, how much have you worked with him?
I got my back broken in two places.
so he has not been handled.
so he was more or less raised like an orphan.
Yeah.
those can be the worst kind.
the orphans are always the worst, 'cause they don't learn anything about respect that they would have learned from their mother or from other horses.
they don't respect anything or anybody.
you know, people thought I should put him down.
they thought maybe he had some brain damage.
he's extremely dangerous, and he attacks cars.
I'm sure you're anxious to get that one in here, Dan.
don't get hit.
step in behind him there.
when he was an orphan, I didn't have a barn, 'cause my house burned down, and my barn burned down.
so I raised him...
it was cool, so I raised him in the house.
it was cold, and l...
so I bottle-fed him every couple of hours.
and l... how do you say it... potty-trained him.
it started out a good relationship.
it's just, somebody else has to come in and help me.
he's different.
and he's a stud too?
Yeah, I'd do that the sooner, the better.
I mean, it looks to me like the last thing you need is a damn stud.
if you're gonna have one, a lot of you guys, you just as well get you a grizzly bear, an orangutan.
I've known Buck for over 20 years, and I've seen one other horse besides Kelly, a stallion, that stands out, but I've never ever witnessed anything quite like that, that dangerous and unpredictable.
is somebody planning on trimming his feet someday?
Yeah. - Any shoers here?
come on, you cowards.
you want to shoe him right now, or would you rather I got him a little better?
you're booked.
cause Dan's gonna saddle him and ride him around here.
a lot of you that don't understand much about a rope, you'll find out I can stop him, and that's gonna come in handy for you, Dan.
when you're on him, you're gonna be really glad that I can stop him, once you understand how much more control I have by hind foot than I would by a halter on his head.
you already know you can't control him with a halter on his head, 'cause he's been chewing on people and has already been aggressive and wanting to attack people.
Hey, I want you guys to understand.
you can't hold it against him for kind of how his life has been.
little bit, he'll lead soft.
okay, Dan, you can come on in.
we're just gonna kind of love on him for right now.
you just kind of ease up beside him and just pet him.
come on over with your blanket.
you'll just go up and rub him.
Yeah, good.
good. Go get your saddle.
and you kind of... while his frame of mind is kind of humble like that, you can cuddle him and kind of love on him too, so just pet him on the hind leg.
now just see if you can just gently pick up the hoof.
that's the way.
there you go.
you can go around the front.
rub him on his face there when he's being a good guy.
watch him, though.
block him when he wants to bite you, block, block.
that's the biggest thing is, nobody's ever blocked him.
we had to put up a sign that says "attack horse," because if somebody did walk into the pasture, he would have taken 'em out.
one time, some people started teasing him, and I went up to him about 12 feet away in this golf cart, thinking that would bring him away from the fence, and instead he looked back at me, pinned his ears, ducked his head, and did that aggressive horse behavior and came right at me.
going, striking, feet, everything, and he pretty much came up over the golf cart and nailed me.
now go for a little walk with him.
now we're gonna stop him.
pet him.
you're the good cop there, Dan.
you just love on him.
rub him down that hind leg.
looks good.
just get on him like he's Grandma's horse.
all right.
pick your lead rope up so it's not dragging there.
so you can kind of bend him if you need to, to the left.
pet him.
you just rub him all over like you're just totally in love.
there you go.
okay, walk off again.
Yeah, go ahead, just say, "Come on. Let's go, Yeller."
there you go.
pet him. Pet him when he goes, see.
you got to remember that. Now maybe we can lope him.
you got an opportunity.
there. Go ahead.
go on. Pet him. Pet him.
rub him on the butt.
we don't want him to think every time he feels anything back there, he's just gonna get whacked.
good job. I'm gonna stop you now.
okay, you can step off him nice and clean.
this isn't open for discussion.
at this point, Dan is the only one permitted to lead this horse anywhere, and then later on, maybe a little short evening session, you can work him on the end of your lead rope in here when it's just you and him by yourself.
I was really embarrassed, because he said nobody should have a stud horse, and I'm thinking, "God, if he only knew I had a whole pasture full at home, that I have."
and then he said not letting him get his head over so he can bite, well, it's healed up pretty well, but I'm gonna have that the rest of my life, yeah.
you know, I have thousands of horses under my belt and lots of experience.
and, hell, the safest place around this son of a bitch is on him.
you felt fine when you were on him.
but around him on the ground, he's treacherous 'cause of what he's, you know, gotten to be.
and he could hurt Dan or me or you or anybody else just in being spoiled, and he doesn't want to be that way, but he doesn't know any other way to be.
he's as close to having been turned into a predator as you're gonna find.
cause he's... he's been wrecked.
I'd want to give the older horses a chance to get him some manners.
he's run with some studs, and they take...
you're nuts for having that many studs running together, lady; I'm telling you that.
most people don't need studs, and for God's sake, they don't need 18 of them.
I don't know what you're trying to prove.
and if you got a lot going on in your life, probably a lot of it's a lot bigger story than this horse.
Yeah.
you ought to be a SEAL team member or something, as much risk as you like to take.
why don't you learn how to enjoy your life?
life's too damn short.
this horse tells me quite a bit about you.
so this is just an amplified situation of what is.
maybe there... maybe there are some things for you to learn about you that maybe the horses is gonna be the only damn way you're gonna learn it, 'cause you might not listen to somebody else.
well, that's all right.
sometimes I don't either, and I should.
ask my wife.
I love the horses, but I have a responsibility to my fellow human too, you know, if I think maybe you might do something to get yourself hurt and you don't even see it coming, if I see it coming, l...
you know, I have a moral obligation to say you're in big trouble here.
sound fair?
okay.
he's right.
I mean, he's right.
l... you know?
he's right, and I'm not...
it's not just the horse.
he's... he's right about my life.
Yeah.
so, Dan, if you feel safer just roping him, can you rope him?
I need to get my horse kind of warmed up a little bit.
Dan, Dan, Dan!
watch out! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
he's a psychopath.
get out. You're bleeding really bad.
he got you in the head. Get out.
that's it.
you're done.
you got it?
here, Dan. Hop down.
just hop down.
well, I need to stay here.
I know. I know. I know.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Dan, you've got a huge hole.
you need sutures.
it's a huge hole.
that's pretty bad, and you always carry something with you just in case.
I'm gonna have to put him down.
you want a ride in and throw some stitches on?
no, no. - Not your chin.
Oh, look what he did to my hat.
he bit you.
he bit you in the head?
holy shit.
then he knocked me over.
okay, go sit down in my mom's car right there.
Why?
cause I'm taking you to get stitches.
it's deep.
you could see the bone in the...
big fuss they make about it, just get it cleaned and closed.
Mr. Brannaman, you need to talk a little sense into Dan, and I figure you're probably the only one that can do it.
dang.
about the third time I got that saddle blanket up over his back, boy, I didn't even see him, man.
he hit me with his teeth, boy, and knocked me flat.
get it stitched up.
what you gonna do?
we're gonna have to put him down.
I won't give him off to somebody who's gonna beat him to a pulp with a 2x4.
it's not something you do, and he... he's dangerous.
I'm gonna put him down, and that's the most humane thing to do for him.
Yeah.
get out of there.
Dan.
Dan, Dan, Dan! - Hey!
Yeah, do not get close to him.
step back away from him.
is Buck coming? - Yeah.
please step back away from him.
I was just backing up to get the shot.
how are they gonna get him in that trailer?
come on, Kel.
come on, Kel. Come on.
just sit still.
just wait.
come on, Kel. Come on, Kel.
come on. Up.
sit still. Just sit still.
just sit still.
just don't do anything.
okay, we'll see if you have any questions here.
well, I'll talk to you right now.
the colt, when it was born, was not breathing when they got to it, and they didn't know for how long.
so the vet even figured that the horse had been oxygen-deprived for quite a long period of time, but he still could have made it in spite of his handicap that he was born with.
he could have made it.
if you just would treat this as if that horse, because of the oxygen deprivation, had some sort of a learning disability.
well, number one, they should have worked with him like you might work with a disabled child and said, "Look, you might need a little bit of extra education because of where you're coming from."
so you could have taken that disabled child and turned him into something of value to himself and everyone else, and he may have ended up just a kind, nice little horse that didn't have a lot to offer mentally but was just kind of okay with people, and he might have packed someone around.
he might have been the absolute opposite of what he is.
but you know damn good and well, she would go home, and she would either get hurt, get killed, or someone else would get hurt that was totally innocent.
the human failed that horse.
the human is that X factor.
that horse is a mirror.
all your horses are a mirror to your soul.
and sometimes you might not like what you see in the mirror.
sometimes you will.
what were you thinking when you were just being so kind and patient with that horse to get him in there instead of just, "You're no good," shut the door, and go?
to have contempt for the horse never would even occur to me.
that's not...
maybe... maybe 30 years ago, it would have, maybe.
one of the biggest challenges of a horseman is, is to be able to control your emotions, and it's a...
you know, probably more of a challenge for me...
has been, you know, not so much now, but it has been...
because my dad had a violent temper.
he was a terrifying person.
so that kind of followed me around a little bit, thinking, "Am I gonna be just like that old fart," you know?
no.
no, you got a choice.
you can make choices.
you can't blame the whole damn thing on somebody else.
and, you know, I can't help but think that all you guys here, when you have a youngster, that you're gonna be thinking, "Hoo, hoo, hoo, I've got some responsibility."
I'm gonna take care of things and try to make this "as good a life for him as I can" and not let things get out of hand and teach him something," I hope.
I hope.
so we're headed from Chico to Red Bluff to the stock horse and ranch roping contest there.
the Californios is the deal every year in Red Bluff.
buckaroo, vaquero-style roping, this is it.
Reata's doing the kid's class.
they call it the heritage class.
she's really looking forward to that, and this'll be her last year to do the kid's class.
then she'll be too old.
the Californios is one of the highlights of my dad's season, 'cause he's been on the road traveling, living in his horse trailer, meeting a bunch of new people, having to memorize their names.
so I think it is definitely one of his highlights.
she won this event last year, Reata Brannaman, and she's showing a lot of these guys how to throw that thing.
that's about the most fun for me is out there roping with my daughter.
she wants to be...
she emulates everything her dad does.
she wants to be just like him.
she's her father's daughter.
we did teach her how to ride, but it was already in her.
she could ride from the very beginning.
I mean, the very first time I ever watched her rope,
I thought, "Who's been teaching you?"
okay, we're good to go.
Reata Brannaman and her lovely assistant.
Yes, lovely assistant.
the way this works is, they've got seven minutes to do this.
Yeah! Yeah!
gee, she's a handy kid.
Outropes most men now.
there'll come a time when she'll be beating me, and that'll be fine.
it'll be time to turn it over to her.
then I'll just sit around in the grandstands and talk about all the stuff I used to be.
but hopefully that'll be about another 30, 40 years.
people say they're too old when they're, like, 40, and you think, "Shut up. Too old."
bill Dorrance was roping when he was 94.
that's how I want to be when I grow up, if I ever do.
Oh, it's always neat to see them after I've been gone for a long time, yeah.
but it's always hard to leave too.
you know, once you're around them for a few days, kind of start getting used to being around them.
then you go back to your life of solitude.
so I'm still on the move.
I'm getting better, because I'm still studying.
I still want to be a better horseman.
I've learned so many things, and I thought originally I was just gonna be there to figure out how to get a colt started and figure out how to be a little better cowboy.
that's what I thought it was about.
come to find out, that wasn't what it was about at all.
out of a group like this, there might be some who become artists, where you become creative, and you use your imagination.
now, that was a thing of beauty.
you look like one mind and one body.
if you got a taste of it, if you got a taste of what I'm talking about, you couldn't get enough of it.
you'd rather do that than eat.
you may spend your whole life chasing that, and that's possible, but it's a good thing to chase.
this is Buck's favorite joke.
it's a pirate scene, and the guy up in the crow's nest says, "One enemy ship coming on the horizon!"
and the captain says, "Quick, bring me my red shirt, because if I get wounded in battle, the blood won't show, and my men will fight on."
so they had the battle, and after a bit, the guy in the crow's nest says, "Ten enemy ships on the horizon!"
and the captain says, "Quick, bring me my brown pants!"
# Yes, I understand that every life must end #
# Uh-huh #

I can't believe it. - I'm finally going to get to really dance again.
no. She's not right.
marry me. - Oh, Hubbell. No.
I live in this beautiful town called Paradise. It's right on the coast.
mom. - Yes. Mom.
wait, you live with your mother like a serial killer?
I know exactly what you want.
you want to live an unexpected life. And I intend to give you exactly that.
this won't last.
she's a vegas girl. Hubbell will bore her.
she has a dance studio in the back.
her whole life is here. You didn't tell me any of that.
so we heard you're a dancer. - I trained at a. b.t.
do you love him? - I think I could fall in love with him.
truly, what's the matter? - Hubbell.
we went driving looking for the two of you.
it just came out of nowhere.
I'm so sorry.
I don't know.
either path is fraught with peril.
I know that if I ask for a car for my birthday, i'll get it.
how do you know? - I know.
I walked in on a really weird fight they were having involving the guy who does our landscaping and a fondue pot.
weird. - So weird.
anyhow, the minute they saw me they totally clammed up.
which translates to busted, which translates to guilt, which translates to beamer.
however, I know that if I ask them for the car and then I receive said car i'm then indebted to them for the car, which means the next time one of them asks, "does this outfit make me look fat"?
I'm gonna have to look.
I don't know. How bad is the bus?
are you even listening to me?
car, birthday, fondue pot, am I fat, quandary.
what are you doing? - Reading the paper.
who does that?
I'm going to see my grandpa tonight and he likes me to read the paper to him.
so read it to him then.
I always pre-read it and circle the articles I think he'll like because time is an issue at his age and he gets really upset if he falls asleep before I get to gail collins.
the class is out there, ladies.
from our ballet teacher.
anything involving bats, helmets, rackets, goal lines, shin guards, personal fouls or high fives could cause injury and jeopardize our dance careers.
basically anything that happens out there is out.
plus I have cramps.
why don't you just use an ipad?
tried to. He couldn't grasp the concept of it.
he just got angry and thought I was making everything up.
Ugh, the old.
promise you'll put a pillow over my face when I turn 60? - Will do.
did you hear? - Hear what?
Oh, jeez. - The announcement.
Oh, you mean the one that went ..."?
Yes, that's the one. - Then yes, we heard it.
want to know what it said? - Something to do with pink slime?
hubbell was in a car accident last night.
Madame F75anny's hubbell? - Yep.
bad? - Yep.
And? - And... He's...
what, he's what?
you know. - I don't know.
I don't know what that look means. - Melanie!
I don't know what that look means either. - Think. Focus.
follow the information to its obvious conclusion.
Hubbell, accident, two weird looks?
I need a tent. - You...
I've called three different tent companies, but they're not open yet.
you'd think there'd be one 24-hour tent company somewhere in the world if for no other reason, just for novelty's sake.
what do you need a tent for?
for the memorial. - The...
I don't do funerals.
there's no celebration, no ode to life.
life is everything. And life goes on, you know.
buddhists believe that everyone comes back.
doesn't that feat alone deserve a really great party? Of course it does.
it's going to be a traditional buddhist ceremony.
dignified, spiritual, not sappy.
we'll need candles and incense, and a beautiful book for people to write their thoughts in.
I think it's going to rain tomorrow, so I'll have to have it on sunday, though I wonder if there's a religious conflict in having it on a sunday.
Oh well. Jesus will just have to share.
well, he's put up with worse, so.
of course we could do monday in a pinch. - Monday?
do you want coffee? - I...
people are going to bring food.
casseroles, lasagna, ham. Someone always brings a ham.
what they should really bring is some valium and a shrink.
gallows humor.
we need flowers, tons of flowers, roses, tulips, pansies, violets.
Lilies! Lilies everywhere!
is it lily season here? Well, it's lily season somewhere.
I need to make a list of guests, and we need a band.
maybe Juliana can play something on the cello.
I wonder if it's going to rain on monday. She hates to play in the rain.
Plus, rain and a memorial is such a cliched combination.
what are you doing? - I don't know.
tin foil!
I need tin foil and toilet paper.
Oh god. All those people, one guest bathroom.
don't think about it, fanny.
just lie back and think of england.
I blame you.
me too.
senor Dawson.
sorry. - Senor Dawson.
excuse me, miss Yockey? - Yes?
what do you need?
I don't know if you've heard the tragic news, but the son of our beloved ballet teacher, Fanny Flowers, was in a terrible car accident last night.
I did hear. I'm so sorry.
Madame Fanny's been like a surrogate mother to us. All of us.
especially Boo.
I don't know if she's heard.
the p. a. System in this school is so sub-par.
public schools - sad.
anyhow, I just think Boo would maybe take it a little better if her friends broke it to her first. If it's okay.
Oh, of course. I understand.
come here. Bring your things.
come on, Boo. - What's going on?
why are you doing that?
did you hear? - Hear what?
hubbell was in a car accident last night and...
and he's what?
see, she doesn't get the look either. - He's...
Oh my god. He's dead?
Oh, come on! I just gave you that exact same look.
this is terrible. - I know it is. So bad.
let's go. - Where?
bus stop. - What?
keep walking. - We can't.
vengeance walking's at 12: 00 and 2: 30. - We're going to a movie?
everyone grieves in their own way. Head down, look sad.
popcorn's on me. - I don't understand. I gave her the exact same look.
you have other gifts. Go.
well, I am planning a memorial service.
for tomorrow, hopefully.
I understand that, but is there any other color I can get it in?
fine. Goodbye.
well, it's official. The people in the tent-rental industry are very unpleasant.
the only company that can get me a tent to hold 100 people by sunday said all of their tents are white canvas.
white canvas. No one in the world wanted pink or blue?
I asked them how much to dye a tent and they laughed at me. Like I'm ellen.
you have 100 people coming? - More.
I went over the invite list and realized I forgot to invite the garden club.
who do you know in the garden club?
I'm inviting most of the town and they are in the town, so that brings the head count up by 20.
maybe I should forget a tent and think about a theater.
I'll put that on the possible list.
Oh, here. I printed up a list of buddhist memorial traditions off the internet.
there are some chants you should learn.
Ah. Finally a chance to use my high school tibetan.
I remember years ago when the husband of a friend of mine died.
my entire wiccan group went down to the ocean at midnight sang a song, threw our clothes off, joined hands and ran into the sea.
it was really beautiful.
there will be kids there.
they can wear floaties.
you were in a wiccan group?
well, I was living in Vancouver. I didn't ski, so.
traditionally, everyone should wear white robes and headbands.
we'll look like a cult. - Or a karate class.
maybe instead of headbands, everyone could wear a scarf?
or a cape. - I love capes.
who doesn't love a cape?
where are we gonna get all those capes? - We can cut up that tent.
Boo! We're late! - We're not that late.
20 minutes. We are 20 minutes late.
Ow! Side cramp. - Rock in shoe.
can't breathe. Breathing bad.
slow down, you're killing your friends.
you don't want me to run to class, next time tell me the real time.
I did! - You said it was 2: 00. It was not 2: 00!
it looked like 2: 00. - Spots. Seeing spots.
it had not been 2: 00 for an hour! - Oh, I think i'm gonna barf!
no you won't! Not until we get inside.
she's not even here. - She's not?!
I told you she wouldn't teach today. - The day is not over yet.
Oh, brother. - We're going to hell. All of us.
as long as I don't have to run there.
Madame Fanny's son dies and what do we do?
we watch Mark Wahlberg blow up france for two and a half hours.
it was a long movie. - Not my point, Melanie.
calm down.
what about a Mark Wahlberg movie says "sorry for your loss"?
nothing. We suck.
you suck, you suck, you suck.
I suck. We all suck.
but tell me how you really feel?
we suck and we're going to hell. - Wake up, Boo! We live in hell.
the worst that can happen is we go to Carpinteria.
I'm getting dressed over there.
do not follow me.
your dance space. My dance space.
any?
Nope. Nothing.
she's not gonna teach today. - I wouldn't want to teach either.
it's so weird, isn't it?
yesterday he was here, and today he's not.
well, I heard they found his shoe 30 feet away.
I heard they still haven't found his face.
horrible. We're horrible. Everyone in this room is horrible.
I heard they had just had sex right before he went out and...
give it up, mel. - Crap.
I wonder if that was the first time they'd ever had sex.
I wonder if that was the first time he'd ever had sex.
that's probably what killed him. - What are you talking about?
okay, you're a virgin for 75 years and then the first time you have sex, you do it with a las vegas showgirl?
he couldn't handle it. - Dude drove right into a tree.
if an asteroid hit this place right now, we absolutely had it coming.
when my grandmother died, her spirit haunted our car.
what? - Yep.
suddenly, the day after the funeral, you couldn't start it is someone was sitting in the passenger seat.
grandma really liked her passenger seat. - What did you do?
we sold the car. - You sold your grandmother?
and bought a ski-doo. - lightning hit our pool three years ago.
who died? - No one.
we're talking death, Melanie. Stay on topic.
not enough "hail mary"s in the world.
I feel like we're missing something special. Something with flair.
Hello?
Yes.
I'm looking to have cocktail napkins made with the dalal lama's face on them.
does he ever not wear glasses?
okay, she's acting crazy, right?
I don't know. Compared to what?
not you, honey.
then maybe.
she's in shock. She's in pain.
she hasn't talked about anything but planning this memorial since the accident happened.
when I picked her up from the police station she was wondering if an evite was too informal.
it's denial. - The seven steps.
dalal lama cocktail napkins.
you go through a lot of napkins at those things.
well, that's basically done.
they just have to wire tibet for permission to use his likeness.
so where were we?
ice cream truck.
I just went out and got some bagels if anyone's hungry.
no one eats carbs anymore. - Oh, okay.
well, they're stale. If that helps at all.
you know, all that chewing. Helps burn some extra calories.
is there anything I can do? - Nope.
so... she's still here.
wonder why.
it just happened, Vi. - I know.
but she really didn't know him in the first place.
there's nothing here for her now.
she's awfully tall, isn't she?
was she ever a man? - Why would you say that?
I don't know, I just think the town could use a woman who used to be a man, to go with the republican and the Liza Minnelli impersonator.
Hello?
Oh, it's the monk.
Yes, your holiness.
thank you for calling me back.
what are you doing? - Cleaning up.
I'm cleaning up. Someone should clean up.
I could clean up. - Well, there's no point now. It's almost done.
is there anything else I can do? - No.
I didn't think anyone ate carbs anymore.
Yeah, well, i'm thinking of singlehandedly bringing them back.
you know, along with smoking, lead paint, thalidomide, slip 'n slide.
picturing my face under there?
I don't understand.
no, literally I don't understand. Could you put the interpreter back on.
Oh, thank god, yes.
as I was trying to tell the lama while I'm very grateful he agreed to pray for hubbell,
I was actually hoping he would do it here. At the memorial on Monday.
or Tuesday. We're flexible about the day.
could you ask him again?
because I already have a monk in ireland who said he'd pray from there.
but I was really looking for someone to represent.
what if I throw in a trip to Disneyland?
does he have a friend who's not busy chanting for the Japanese people?
all right. Thanks anyway.
what is it about these monks? How hard is it to get on a plane?
well, at least he said he'd pray for him. That's nice.
he can say anything he wants. He's on another continent.
how do I know he's really doing it? - Well, he is a monk.
so? - So he's a monk.
their to-do list basically consists of "pray" and... You know, "pray.
I take my spirituality very seriously.
if I don't see it with my own eyes, I don't believe it.
Amen.
I can't believe he's gone.
Oh, truly. - I'm sorry.
don't be sorry.
you loved him. - Well, I did. I did love him.
you two were magic together. Soulmates.
when you would make pies- - Well, he made pies. I just ate them.
they were so good.
just be happy you found each other.
and know that no matter what happened between the two of you, he loved you with all his heart.
Really? Right here. - True love never dies.
it just takes a break for a while.
okay. Anyone need some help?
no? Great. Going for a walk.
I thought we would get married. I just wanted to call you mom.
Oh, honey. You don't need a ring to call me mom.
Oh my god!
you taking a walk?
I guess.
you want to walk my dog?
Oh, finally! - Hi, Talia.
I can't believe you waited so long to call me.
come on, I'm dying. Tell me everything.
I want to take notes to tell the girls later.
okay. Go.
well, we got here, I bought a dress, went to a party, fought with his mom, had sex, danced with his mom, he got in a car accident and now he's dead.
say it. - Nope.
Talia. - You have the worst luck with men!
Yep. There you go. - I've never seen anything like it.
let it out. - It's like you're cursed Or jinxed.
or built your house on an ancient Indian burial ground.
okay, gotta go. - No, wait!
hanging up.
you want a bone?
you have teeth?
you danced with his mother? - bye.
that was Talia. She's older than she looks, pass it on.
I'm sorry.
I'm back. Do over? - Okay.
how are you? - I'm...lost.
Oh, honey. - No, I'm genuinely lost.
I have no idea where I am. - Michelle...
I have nowhere to sit down. I have nowhere to sleep.I have no clothes to change into.
I have no clothes to change into.
Oh my god, I have no key to the house.
I don't even know if she'll let me in when I get back. If I get back.
Michelle... - No, seriously, Talia. They won't let me do anything.
they won't let me clean up or make phone calls.
she's calling her mom and I'm walking an old guy's dog.
and that's not a sexual euphemism.
and I don't even know when the memorial service is.
and no one eats carbs anymore.
how was the sex?
it was really really good.
take a load off, Annie.
that a service dog? - Like a marine?
like a seeing-eye dog, that kind of thing?
Yeah. He is my service dog.
when I get really drunk and pass out in the gutter, he is my pillow.
okay.
what'll you have?
well, what's not gross here?
really tricky questions for 100, alex.
that has its moments.
okay. I'll have that and a margarita.
okay.
so.what kind of day you having? - That kind.
thought so.
you had that look in your eye.
this your place? - For 20 years.
used to be a nice respectable surf bar, but with this freakin' economy, you wanna make ends meet, now you gotta serve brunch!
I hate brunch. Pick a meal.
Oh, a girl after my own heart.
to time-specific eating habits. - Here here.
nice dog. - Thanks.
what's his name? - Don't know.
is he dead? - Don't know.
right on.
I'm just walking him. - Why?
old guy asked me to. Couldn't think of a reason to say no.
you like dogs? - Not particularly.
that could be your reason. - Where were you an hour ago?
what's your name? - Sophie Tucker.
nice to meet you, Sophie. I'm Rico.
so you new in town?
Yep. Just got here yesterday.
moving to a new town on a thursday ， ballsy!
Yeah. I came here with my husband. He lives here with his mother.
well, he lived here with his mother.
lived? Past tense?
junior college.
wait, you're that girl. - I'm sorry?
you're the sex at the party girl.
Yeah. I am that girl.
dude.
tough break.
man, that thing in the kitchen.
what thing? - You know, the thing!
the fryer? - Yeah, the fryer.
what about it? - There's a sound.
a frying sound?
man, I don't know about kitchens and the things in kitchens.
Sophie Tucker, this is my wife Nina.
my name's not really Soph... - She's the sex at the party girl.
dude. Tough break.
Hello? - Thought she'd have bigger boobs.
what is that smell? - It's the thing, man.
Oh man.
I think you have the wrong.
Oh. Well, I don't know if we've hired a sitar player for the memorial yet.
you'll have to talk to Fanny about that.
I don't know what's wrong with her voicemail, so, I......
no, I don't need to hear you.
no, I really don't need to hear
well, you're very good.
Yes. Your mother is wrong.
Hey, how did you get my number?
thank god I found you.
I forgot to ask Fanny something very important, and by the time I got back to her house she had started her 16 hours of meditative silence.
is that yours? - Uh, yes.
I'm gonna have to call you back.
Fanny asked me to do a life-sized sculpture of hubbell.
to have on the deck at the memorial.
I do found object sculptures. I'm in galleries.
on deck? On deck of what?
we're not sure. There's talk of the intrepid.
what? - That sounds crazy to you too, right?
the aircraft carrier intrepid from the war?
she said she was getting a great deal on it. Something about a coupon.
a coupon for an aircraft carrier? - I don't know.
she was so screwy earlier.
though, I mean, who could blame her, right?
I wish she'd talk.
but you know Fanny.
not really.
anyway, Fanny asked me to do a sculpture, which of course I'll do.
but I only do nudes.
so I'm gonna need some input. - What?
now... Judging by his general build, i'm guessing he looked something like this.
Hello? - It's Minka from Cozy catering.
I'm trying to get some confirmation concerning the memorial service menu.
what kind of confirmation?
just that the head count is now 500. - That's impossible.
because if it is, I don't get my new shipment of tomatoes until wednesday.
I can't have those tarts made until Thursday, Friday at the latest.
the memorial can't be Friday. - Oh, Friday would be better for me too.
gives me more time to do the detail work. - I'm gonna have to call you back.
I'm sorry, I have to go. - Wait! Wait.
what do you think? - Aah! Jeez.
am I at least in the ballpark?
this is ridiculous.
boo? - No.
she's not coming. - No.
boo, she's not going to teach today, okay?
if you keep us here any longer, at least demand a ransom.
if Madame Fanny suddenly decides that she wants to teach today, we are going to be here for her to teach.
you know you're crazy, right?
nobody's leaving!
okay.
I have to go to the bathroom.
never mind.
Fanny! - What?
sorry to interrupt the whole suffocating-yourself with-a-pillow thing, but things are happening that need your attention.
my god. You nearly gave me a heart attack.
I asked nicely，twice. Nothing.
I am in the middle of a 16-hour meditative silence, which only works if you're silent.
well, I either need to talk to you now or get more minutes on my phone plan.
first of all, we hired a sitar player.
he's very good. He's got the whole opening of "Dear Prudence" down cold.
the caterer wants to know if the head count is really 500, cause if it is, there's a problem with the tarts, which would push the memorial back till friday which is great for the woman making a sculpture of my husband's genitalia out of old hubcaps.
also, the traditional buddhist mariachi band you wanted is on tour in Bolivia till fall, so what do you think?
make it a halloween theme? Everyone can come in costume?
everything's so jammed in here, how can you find anything?
the ham's right there. - I see the ham.
your daughter truly handled the fridge so I can't help you with that.
what do you want me to tell the caterer? - I'll handle it.
what do you want me to tell the mariachi band? - I will handle it.
where the hell did you get a coupon to rent the intrepid? - Just let me handle it.
and that would be great! Except that you're not handling it.
and everyone is calling me and I have no idea what to tell them.
yeah?
she's right here. It's for you.
can I tell her what this is regarding?
Ringling brothers says you can use their tent on their down day, but you have to go to sacramento.
Yeah, I'm sorry. That's not gonna work for us.
the voice of reason has just reentered the building.
thank you for the call though.
what are you doing? - I'm cutting the crazy quotient in half.
you have no right to cancel my tent. - 500 people? Really, Fanny?
are there even 500 people in this town?
I'm calling that guy back. - This is getting completely out of hand.
we cannot wait till 2014 to have this memorial. It has to be now.
tomorrow, like you planned originally when it was supposed to be a traditional buddhist ceremony, even though to my knowledge hubbell wasn't a buddhist.
none of this is your concern.
I am going through this too, Fanny.
I came here. I gave up my life.
Oh, what a sacrifice that must have been.
no more getting paid in poker chips?
I am his wife. - And I am his mother!
and I have been his mother for 48 years.
and now I have to figure out the proper way to say goodbye to my son.
and if that includes mariachi bands or circus tents or fireworks or the damn rockettes, then it is for me to decide.
because my heart is completely broken forever.
and when your heart is completely broken forever, you get to do whatever you want, no matter how crazy it seems to the woman who was his wife for 24 hours.
I don't know what you want me to do.
I don't want you to do anything. Ever.
that's it.
Hey, nobody leaves!
why aren't we doing anything? - What?
we should do something! - Sasha, I
Madame Fanny is just sitting there alone and sad and you're just sitting here and we're just sitting in the studio and no one is doing anything!
all day long we've done nothing.
well, boo lost her mind and we went to a movie, but other than that, nothing!
someone should do something! - What?
I don't know. Something.
okay.
where is everybody?
you're kidding, right? You left.
and when you left, everybody left. - Well, did you try to stop them?
did I? Do you- I've been
you're going to take 10 years off of my life.
how many chairs do you guys have here? Is this it?
Oh, there's some in the boys' dressing room, I think.
what is she doing here? - she's looking for chairs for people to sit on.
dog ears.
okay, we're gonna need to scrounge up some more seating.
are there stools or I don't know, short tables anywhere around here?
what's the matter?
mark Wahlberg. - I know.
in France.
I'm behind here, what happened to Mark Wahlberg in France?
russian mobs, lots of guns. - Salma Hayek in a bra.
is that sad? Because millions of men would disagree with you.
we went to a movie. - Okay.
today. We went to a movie today.
we... Skipped school and we went to a movie today.
boo didn't want to and we all ignored her. - And we made her go.
it's okay. - It's not okay.
you don't even like Mark Wahlberg!
"the Departed" wasn't bad.
we're going to hell. - No, we're not.
you said we were!
I know, but I'm not like the final word or anything.
I'm sorry. - I'm sorry too.
I didn't mean to scare you guys with hell.
it's okay. That's what hell is for.
they were fine when I left.
okay, you guys. Look at me.
I don't need apologies.
God knows I cut school many a time for incredibly dubious reasons.
and with me, nuns were involved, so when you talk about hell,
I got a two bedroom penthouse with a spa tub reserved there, so cocktails at 6: 00!
there's no crying in baseball! Or ballet.
Plus, if you don't stop, I'll start and I don't want to start.
you back?
you joining?
you got phones?
start dialing.
okay.
I'm sorry.
we're going to postpone the gathering for a while.
I don't really have the energy right now.
thank you though.
Hello, Ravi? It's Fanny Flowers.
Yes, I'm sorry, but there's been a change of plans.
we won't need you at the memorial.
no, you are a very good sitar player. It has nothing to do with your abilities.
we're just going to postpone
that's not really necessary. I've already heard you
that was wonderful.
and if we were going to have a memorial, you would definitely
well, have your mother call me.
ravi, I have to go.
what are you...
Oh no. The class.
Oh my god, I forgot all about the class. - Yeah, we figured you did.
I'm so sorry.
it's okay. We know you've got other things to worry about right now.
Yes, but still, it's unforgivable.
please apologize to the other kids for me? - I will.
are they still there? - Oh no no. Everyone went home.
I was gonna lock up, but the sink in the bathroom's running again and I can't turn off the water.
that sink has been a problem ever since I put it in.
maybe if I tried a wrench?
that's all right, I'll take care of it. You go on home.
but it's filling up.
I'll handle it. - Okay.
I'm sorry, Madame Fanny.
me too,Boo.
what's going on?
that's your seat.
I don't know you that well.
so I don't know what to say.
sometimes it's better not to say anything.
sometimes maybe you just need to do something.
so, Fanny, it's not the intrepid.
but this is for you.
you did this?
I didn't do anything. They did.
Bye-bye. - Bye.
that was quite a dance.
they had some pretty good training. - They certainly did.
I liked the song.
I found it in Hubbell's cd player, so I figured...
it's a very good song.
so...
how are you?
I think I stole a dog.
will you excuse me? - Sure.
well? - Well, what?
how was it? - How'd we do?
who fell? - Somebody fell.
it sounded like Edgar. He has a very distinctive thud.
we sucked. - I sucked.
no one sucked. - Someone sucked. Someone always sucks.
no one sucked. No one fell. You guys were perfect.
you melted my cold frozen tundra of a heart.
do you think Madame Fanny liked it? - No. No, I don't.
come on.
I think it was exactly was she needed.
seriously.
you guys, you were truly great.
it was fun. For funeral dancing, I mean. - That sounds creepy.
Hey, let's go say hi to Madame Fanny. - Yeah, go take your bows.
you did good. - Three hours of rehearsal, what do you expect?
so are you leaving now?
not as long as the ham holds out.
no. I mean, are you leaving?
I don't know.
Michelle, there's someone I want you to meet.
this is Jerry Morton.
Jerry and Hubbell went to school together.
Michelle is hubbell's wife. My daughter-in-law.
it's nice to meet you, Jerry. - You too.
Hubbell's been driving us crazy at our poker game for a year talking about you.
Really? - Yeah. He was insane about you.
told us every little detail.
shoe size nine, right?
Oh, yeah. When he met you, that was it.
I'm so sorry. - Thank you.
well, I should get going.
if you need anything, Fanny, anything at all.
I'll call you first thing.
and as soon as things settle down a bit, you just stop by the office and we'll - we'll get the paperwork done.
Fanny can tell you where it is. - Paperwork?
just some signatures, no rush.
signatures for what? - For the will transfer.
well, I thought...
I thought he told you...
he called me on the way back from Vegas.
the land, the house.
he left everything to you.
I'm not she - - tell car - - what? no come on
I don't.
well, you should today.
so you can dance in front of my brother.
if charlie wants to notice me, he can notice me back here.
in the back. - He's not that t. rvanobse
I think my dad's gay.
based on what? - Just a feeling.
he won't come out. Thinks it's a giant secret, but everyone knows.
it's too bad- There're some lovely single gay men in this town.
and Sasha would be so much happier if he smiled once in a while.
it's pretty late.
do your parents know where you are?
Nope! and it was fun!
putting it together, working with the kids.
just because you teach doesn't mean it's over.
Hey!
did someone see the virgin Mary in the rosin box again?
one time and I never said I was sure.
the door's locked.
right, that's what people do when they don't want you to come in and touch their stuff.
class is at 10: 00 and it's always open a half hour early so we can warm up.
is Fanny in there?
why would she be in there if it's locked?
well, maybe she didn't unlock it for a reason.
what reason?
maybe she's testing to see how dedicated you are to ballet.
what? - How bad you want it.
what are you talking about?
well, the door is locked and the only way to get more ballet is to find another way in.
are you willing to dig a tunnel under the studio with nothing but a plastic spoon, and then cut a giant hole in the floor with the chain saw you dragged along, and then once inside, repair the floor with nothing more than a glue gun, some bobby pins and your wits?
well, I see she has her answer.
please don't wait with us anymore.
okay fine.
Oh gee, calling out! We should have thought of that.
Hey, you'd better watch it.
with snark like that you'll wind up with your own dirty-girl sitcom on N.B.C.
I'll be right back.
where are you going? - To find you a teacher, grasshopper.
I liked it. - You did?
I did. - But why?
the emotional struggle between right or wrong?
a woman wrestling with her own identity?
cause it's dirty. - What?
I like my books dirty. - I need a better reason than that.
I do not have one. - It's a national phenomenon.
that's a reason. - Not to read a book.
look, I don't need a reason.
when Judy Blume put out that book "Wifey," I was first in line to buy it.
Why? It's dirty.
the woman who gave you "Are you there god? It's me, Margaret" writes a dirty book, I'm going to read it. Twice- once to my kid.
Oh God. Truly?
what about you? - Oh well, I haven't finished it yet.
why not?
I'm having the tile in my bathroom re-done and I didn't want the workmen to see it laying out, so I thought I'd put it in the garage, but it's not attached, so I walked outside and my neighbor walked by with his dog and I panicked and threw it in the trash.
we talked for a while and I went back inside to wait, but his dog is old and takes a long time to...
anyhow, I fell asleep and the next morning was trash day so
you threw away our reading assignment?
not on purpose. - Book clubs have rules, truly.
I know. I'm sorry.
what book are you talking about? - "Fifty Shades of Grey."
great. Sorry to interrupt the end of literature as we know it, but has anyone seen Fanny?
am I supposed to - Right.
that's quite a gathering you've got there.
what's that supposed to mean?
nothing. So are you the official life-alert pusher?
those women are smart and skilled. - And old.
they are not old. - Compared to you and Methuselah.
I find their conversation stimulating.
truly, what kind of stone did your uncle pass last week?
kidney! - Not gallstone?
no, kidney. There's a picture of it on my phone!
Wow. - Shut up.
gonna reminisce about the days when a cup of coffee - cost two bits?
it's a book club. - You didn't read the book.
so? - So you're hanging with the nickel-slot crowd, truly.
what am I supposed to do?
stay home alone, buy cats on the internet?
you're supposed to go out with people of your own age, do fun things. Meet guys.
you want me to be a slut like you?
Yes, I get a coupon to sizzler for every convert.
thank you for the advice, but those are my friends.
I just think it would be good for you to hang out with people who remember Shaun Cassidy and not Jack Cassidy.
here. - What is this?
it's from fanny. - Fanny? Where is she?
just read it.
truly, there's a class full of kids - locked outside the dance studio.
keys are in the envelope. But- Read the note.
and just so you know, these are the people that like and accept me.
these women find me interesting and invited me into their club.
and yes, maybe that means I have to read a terrible, simply awful, dreadful book, but at the end of that book is cake...And friendship, which is, I'm sure, something you will never understand.
I understand cake.
Celia needs her mylanta.
you're gone? - I'm not gone, I still exist.
I'm just not there. - You just left without saying a word.
I left you a note. - You left truly a note.
I knew you'd come into the house to mooch something from me eventually.
not fair. - What did you mooch?
nothing. There were kids waiting outside the studio to come in.
what's the point, michelle? - The point is you have classes!
I know. And how wonderful that you're there, so I can get away for a week and then you can teach them.
what?
it's fantastic that for once I have a little help.
it's glorious that finally a woman in her twilight years who hasn't had a vacation since eisenhower was in office can, just for a small moment in time, get away, relax, recharge.
and all while a young vibrant woman who normally does nothing all day but obsess over brangelina's wedding can take over.
Hey, do you know how many kids they have?
take a walk! Buy a ring! Eat some cake! It's time.
I'll call you later.
but I can't teach. I have plans this weekend.
what plans?
my friend talia is driving my car here and we're celebrating my birthday.
we have this whole weekend road trip planned. It's gonna be big.
what?
haven't we passed the age where we acknowledge birthdays?
no, we didn't think so.
it sounds a little sad- A woman of your age?
how old do you think I am?
all right. I'm sorry. I guess if you have to have a birthday party like an eight-year-old, and wear a cinderella costume and a tiara...
one year!
then I suppose you could do that all that at night.
but... - Classes are during the day.
but... - I'm not suggesting you sit vigil at the studio.
I'm just saying that for once let an old woman meditate on the final moments she has left in this earthly realm.
what's with the pole? - Ah yes. It's a beauty, isn't it?
I got to thinking about all the things you were talking about.
and when you went on and on about that cardio-striptease class, well, the idea just stuck.
when did I go on and on about cardio-striptease classes?
the other day. - No.
Yes. - No.
night? - No.
Oh, I'm sorry. That was fergie.
anyhow, the idea stuck and I just ordered the pole.
when were you talking to fergie?
she mentioned it on "leno.
anyhow, it's a very hot trend.
it's fun and sexy and very popular with the housewives.
like the tv show? - No, actual housewives.
those still exist? - And they like to slide on poles.
okay, I have no idea how to teach a cardio-striptease class.
there's a dvd and a book. They came with the pole.
Oh goody.
you'll learn the routine, and then liven it up in your own michelle way, I'm sure.
you mean with sarcasm and general hostility toward the world?
I think it's going to be very popular.
I put a sign-up sheet at the oyster bar for one free class, and by the time rico brought my coffee the sheet was full.
Yeah, but, n - enjoy your birthday.
don't take pictures.
okay, whatever happens next, blame fergie.
everyone at the barre.
touch it. - No way.
boo, you're exposed to this stuff all the time.
you work here. Try it.
Nuh-uh, I've never seen that before.
it's fried. - How bad could it be?
so?
can you speak?
is it vegetable?
it's probably clams. Mel, just form words.
go on- words.
cause there's lots of clams back there.
I think she's trying to say something.
I think she's signaling for a mercy killing.
is her face turning a weird color?
okay, whatever. So be at my house at 7: 00 tonight.
the movie starts at 10: 00.
and your parents will definitely be gone?
my mom has an out-of-town conference, she's dragging my dad along.
we're looking at $60 food allowance and complete freedom till sunday night.
I love the movie truck - hitting different towns on different nights.
it's so bohemian. And charlie's going, right?
Yeah, mel, did your idiot brother get us tickets yet?
I don't think she can talk. - Just nod your head yes or no.
it's rated "r." Are they checking i. d.s?
it's a movie inside a truck. I think they're just checking pulses.
I thought you wanted to go.
I do, I'm just saying I don't think we need an elaborate plan or disguises.
Charlie's feet!
okay, we're going to need a little more.
it tastes exactly like charlie's feet.
okay, appalachia, how do you know what your brother's feet taste like?
stop. That's rhetorical. I'm going home.
7: 00 sharp. Don't be late.
it's not bad.
I'm not scared of you.
you see this?
that's a nomi malone. Intimidating, right?
make it rain!
I'm sorry, you leave vegas - then wind up on the pole?
Oh god, talia!
Hi! How's boris?
your car? I thought you named it kyle.
no, that was a boyfriend. - Kyle wasn't a car?
he had miles on him, but he was human.
well, boris is fine. And I come bearing a surprise gift.
your last check from the show.
cool! Wow. Weird. - Why?
it's my last check, it's just - it's like...Reality.
I'm finally realizing no more spangles in my butt crack.
that phrase has never been said so wistfully before, like ever.
what should I do with it? Hoard it? Frame it?
blow it?
and we'll be right back with more from "the suze orman show.
we're spending it - every cent.
birthday road trip and we'll come back with not even a dime left.
and since you're stripping now you're just one bachelor party away from being set.
road trip, yeah right. - Yeah, right on!
you know the crazy lady I live with? - Your mother-in-law?
yeah well, the loon from loontown up and disappeared this weekend and I have to teach all her classes.
so that's what the pole's for?
Yeah, here at paradise dance academy we specialize in girls with daddy issues, so we start 'em young.
so we're not road-tripping?
but the good news is, according to loony, we are at the age where we don't do birthdays anymore.
we're dead? - I guess.
screw that. We will always do birthdays.
we'll just blow it out here in paradise.
Really? - Absolutely.
we can look hot anywhere.
and consider the advantages of looking as hot as we can look in this place.
we'll knock this town on its ass and then kick it in the face if it even tries to fight back.
Oh, I've missed you so much.
I want to show you my place. I have custom-made curtains.
get out. - And fresh fruit in my fridge.
who are you?
okay, so it's quiet. Quiet is nice for a change.
sure. What's that?
that is the surf wax store.
what do they sell? - Surf wax.
And? - Surf wax.
And? - Surf wax.
And? - Surf wax.
I can keep this up as long as you can. - Weird.
what's weirder is that it used to be a flip-flop store, where they sold flip-flops.
And? - Really?
Hey, this looks interesting. - Uh, talia?
Oh my god! These clothes are so cute.
C'mon. Let's start blowing that paycheck.
whoa, there, tex. We can't go in there.
why not?
you know how in a fairy tale there's like a bridge that leads to a castle where there's a beautiful princess that's locked in a tower, but there's a crazy little troll that lives under the bridge, and in order to rescue the princess you have to deal with the troll?
Yeah. - Welcome to sparkles.
where the motto is "if you're a princess, you're screwed.
Oh my god, are those ducks on a dress?
Oh, these are classic.
Michelle, do you see these? Who would think to make a dress like this?
can I help you?
once upon a time - I was just loving the duck dress.
Oh, and this. And this and- oh my god. Michelle, look how cute!
I make everything myself and I can alter anything that doesn't fit for free.
gold mine. This place is a gold mine.
you haven't been in here for a while. - Uh, I've been busy- what?
the prices! Have you seen the prices? Are these the real prices?
Yes. - Everything.
we're buying everything. Michelle, start grabbing stuff.
we have a lot of trying on to do before tonight.
tonight? What's happening tonight?
it's her birthday.
I will have a happy birthday. Thank you, truly.
what are you going to do? - Oh, we're just going to go out.
that sounds fun. - It's not just fun.
the way we celebrate, it's epic. We're very into birthdays.
this purse? I'm getting two.
what's with the decapitated bear head? - I'm making a coat.
you're kidding. - No. Look.
that is the most disturbed thing I think you've ever done.
does it come in my size? - You want to try it on?
Yes.
so where are you going to go for your birthday tonight?
Oh boy. We haven't figured that out yet.
we usually just see where the night takes us.
remember the time we got drunk and snuck on stage with tom jones and danced for 10 minutes before he noticed we weren't supposed to be there?
three quarters of "delilah" and half of "what's new, pussycat?
and then that lady threw that room key and it hit you in the head and you had to go to the hospital and get three stitches.
but the doctor was really cute and he took us out to dinner afterwards.
Dr. Lobster. - Dr. Lobster.
that had to make the top-five birthday list, right?
number four. - Really, what was five?
comic-con- Princess leia costume contest. One-two sweep.
right. Number three?
sneaking onto the plane with... - Bon jovi! Right.
so so right. - Two?
two was when I kissed george clooney.
you kissed george clooney? - Yeah.
what was it like? - Like kissing george clooney.
and that was two? Kissing george clooney was two.
Yep. - What was one?
Oh well, one... - We never talk about one.
no, it was so monumental... - That we don't want to repeat it.
and we can't remember it.
for my last birthday fanny took me to colonial williamsburg. I got a bonnet.
Oh, that sounds...
vaguely amish.
I bet tonight's going to be really fun.
make sure to tell me all about it.
when? - When we talk.
when do we talk? - We're talking now.
but that's 'cause she didn't understand about the troll.
you know, sometimes when you're going out, the two of you, it's nice to have another person along to keep an eye on your bag if you get up to dance or to watch the bathroom door in case you need to use the men's room?
a third person like in "charlie's angels." - There were three of them.
Yeah, but only two stayed on the show for the entire run - so really there were two.
there were three in the picture. - But two in loyalty and spirit.
but three in reality and number. I was thinking if you needed a third...
we don't. - I could come along...
two is fine. - and watch the men's room door for you.
you don't want to come with us. - Why not?
Yeah, why not? - Wow, are we so not communicating today.
you said I need to go out with people my own age.
Yeah, but not with me.
you're the only person my own age that I know.
but - I'll give you 20% off of everything.
and some free mood rings. - I love mood rings.
come on, she'll be handy. - How?
like if a button falls off or a zipper breaks, I can fix it.
Yeah, plus she's cute. Like a purse dog.
it'll be like having a shih tzu. - Oh please?!
please let me be your shih tzu?
okay, but if she's coming, we have to change the whole package.
I don't know what that means, but let's do it!
I should not have worn these shoes. They're cute.
they're tight and they make me walk funny.
they make you walk sexy. - Really?
in a hanna-barbera kind of way. - You'll be doing a lot of sitting.
tell me again that I'm crazy! - you're crazy!
when I have nothing but proof on my side?!
what proof? - What do we do?
I guess we knock? - what are you doing?
I can't be held accountable for my actions. Apparently I'm crazy!
No! put that down!
that's jonathan adler, you lunatic!
you first. - I'm not going to knock.
we can't just stand here. - Should we go?
what are you doing? - I'm texting sasha.
you come over here and you say that to my face!
Oh, I hope he doesn't come over here and say that to her face.
get in. Move quickly up the stairs, do not say a word.
come on, boo. and who, for the love of god,- needs this many throw pillows?!
Hi, Mr. And Mrs. Torres.
I didn't want to be rude.
sorry.
sorry.
sorry.
sorry.
she's going to be sorry for the next 40 plucks.
just issue a blanket apology and move on.
what's up with you?
I don't know why you're plucking your eyebrows if you can't take the pain.
because charlie is going to be there tonight and ginny's going to make me look like dita von teese.
wait, I am? - Aren't you?
I thought I was making you look like kat von d.
I thought charlie liked dita von teese.
who does charlie like? - Neo from the matrix.
okay, never mind. They're almost the same person. I'll do a combo.
almost done, now I just need my accent color.
what time is it? We need to leave.
maybe they're not going to go out.
Oh, they're going out. This is a work thing.
my mother never misses a work thing.
she'd rather let her roots grow out than miss a work thing.
maybe gold.
Melanie, painting your pinky another color doesn't look like an accent.
it just looks like you ran out of polish.
I didn't invent the concept.
even worse- You're copying someone else's moronic idea.
wow, pleasant person, party of one.
Sasha! Come down here please! - Great.
I know they fight a lot, but this one sounds bad.
I wonder if it's about the timothy situation.
must be. - We don't know if that's true or not.
we know. Everyone knows.
Sasha's dad and timothy marsh are boyfriends. They're in love.
forbidden love. - Forbidden by who?
Sasha's mom. - Yeah well
and now timothy's moving away.
and they'll never get to really be together.
sad. - So so sad.
it's quiet.
everybody decent? - Josh!
you scared us half to death.
I did? - We thought you were sasha.
why are you scared of sasha?
because she's using her parents' corpses as a couch.
no, she's not. I just saw her. She's having a yogurt. She let me in.
what are you doing here?
I brought you guys some overnight kits.
nothing big, just some muffins, cookie dough, pre-loaded pez dispensers, some apples for boo...
two decks of cards if you want to play some canasta, cucumber eye masks
pop them in the freezer for a few minutes for the best results
fuzzy socks in case your feet get cold - and a dvd of "grease.
wow, you're the only person in the world whose boyfriend is basically a girl.
I meant that in a good way. - I sure hope so.
you have the best boyfriend ever. - I do, don't i?
Oh my god, I love cookie dough! It's my crack.
you want to stay? - Nope, it's girls' night out.
I am gonna either go hit a strip club or do some trig homework. I'm still debating.
are you sure you don't want to come to the movie with us?
bag. out.
what's going on down there?
my mother's redecorating.
what does that mean besides new furniture?
it means the idiots are not going out.
rats!
well, at least we ve snacks. - And fuzzy socks.
and we can watch "grease"- sing-along.
what are we,"revenge of the nerds"? We are going out.
what? - How?
look, once my mother is done wrecking the joint, she'll take her happy bye-bye pills and go lie down.
and then my father will go in the den, put on his headphones and watch old performances of his college improv group for the rest of the night.
they'll never know we're gone.
but- - no buts!
now paint it if you're gonna paint it, pluck it if you're gonna pluck it, but get your shoes and bring the bags 'cause we are going out!
come on, truly. - No.
just let us see the dress. - I can't.
honey, you have to come out of the dressing room if you want to watch the men's room for us.
I feel like a hooker. - Then we've done our job.
here, boy.
I'll give you a treat.
I told you we had to change the whole package.
okay! Fine, I'm coming out.
Wow. You look totally doable in that.
I do? - You do.
you sure? This isn't some cruel hazing ritual you've concocted to humiliate me?
how did we not think of concocting a cruel hazing ritual to humiliate her?
we are so off our game. - You look great.
I do? Michelle?
angels, the mission tonight is to go out there and rock the casbah!
I don't know what "rock the casbah" means.
stick with the "whoo" instinct, truly. Your first impulse was right on that.
okay.
Boo! - Sorry.
did I screw up my eyebrows? - No. I think you look like kat von d.
or dita von teese.
I think I look like me with uneven eyebrows.
don't worry, boo. I'm sure charlie, like every guy in america, has very strong eyebrow-tweezing opinions.
I bet he makes all his decisions based on the tweeze.
so are mine okay? - Sure.
great, the princess and all her little princess friends are here.
what's your problem? - We've been here for hours.
Really? For hours?
like you've been right here for how many hours?
enough hours. - You were at the house like 10 seconds ago.
so hand 'em over and stop bitching. - Here, now go away.
for the rest of the night I don't know you and you don't know me.
we look identical, moron!
boo, what are you doing? - Being invisible.
it's what I do best. - Can we just go inside?
you officially suck!
the place is full, we almost didn't find seats and the seats we do have aren't together.
I'm never doing anything for you or your friends ever again!
I thought you didn't know me.
someday, boo, someday you will tell me what exactly you like about my brother.
because seriously, I don't get it.
I don't think you're supposed to get it. That would be gross.
he's right. No seats together.
and I'll probably end up sitting next to some loser who's been lifting things all day and didn't bother to shower.
Oh my god, debbie downer, relax. We'll get four seats together.
how? - Children
Ginny, see that seat up there next to the old guy?
yeah? - Go up there and get him to move.
how? - He's old.
you can probably just make water sounds and he'll have to run for the bathroom.
Mel, you go up front and be tall. - Got it, be tall. And then?
be tall in front of people and they will switch with you - and you'll end up with ginny.
brilliant. - I'll go in the back and work my way forward.
boo, over there. Work your way in. Got it?
fan out and we'll meet in the middle.
sorry sorry.
I could really really use some popcorn.
Yeah, popcorn. Popcorn is awesome. I'm on it.
hi there.
I know, I'm tall. Genes, right?
the inherited ones, not the lowrise kind.
we could switch. I don't mind.
Hi. I was wondering if you would...
what's wrong with your eyebrows?
switch with me? - Nope.
Yeah, I think it's about vampires.
they battle flesh-eating zombies- very scary.
especially for children and, well, anyone with a bad ticker.
a bad what? - ticker- Isn't that what you call it?
Hey, I could really use a soda.
not into older women, huh?
why are you holding a freakin' baby?
don't ask. - But how
my last plan to switch seats backfired, okay?
I said don't ask.
no. No no.
please don't make me guess how old you are.
Hey, I really could use some nachos.
so go get some. - Rats.
I'm gone for two seconds and you're hitting on another girl?
I'm going home. - Wait!
at the buzzer.
Mel! - I wasn't talking to her.
liar! - Where's boo?
she hasn't moved.
she's putting down roots. - Raising a family.
we gotta get rid of this guy.
he's not budging for anything. - We're so close.
wait, let me try something.
excuse me, could we have your seat - so we can all sit together?
well, sure.
I did not think of that.
I'll text boo.
Charlie! Dude! A seat!
Oh, um, I'll talk to you after, right? - Sure.
no way. Wow.
what do I do? - Stay there.
wait, is she still holding a baby?
somehow that doesn't surprise me at all.
Oh my god. - Hey boo.
uh, hey hi. What's up?
is that a baby? - No.
okay, people, who's missing a baby?
want some? - Okay.
how is everything in this town closed by 6: 00?
Branson is open later - Branson.
my god, even the osmonds' dinner show doesn't start until 7: 00.
I've gotta take these shoes off. No no no.
party rule number one: never take your shoes off until the end of the night.
your feet will swell and you'll never get them back on again.
then you're the loser carrying her shoes around.
here's the movie truck. - Yay, activity.
are you kidding me? - Unbelievable.
plus ticket dude's a lady.
can't even seduce our way in. - Just our luck.
we could bribe her. - With what money?
with the money you were gonna use for my fabulous birthday dinner. And there's my check.
it's gone. - Talia.
we spent it at sparkles. - What did we buy?
my outfit, your outfit, truly's outfit.
truly owns the store! - It was a gift.
it's not a gift unless you buy it for the person.
so you're buying gifts for truly from her own store, but you're not buying me dinner?
she's standing right there and you're making her feel bad.
and look how cute she looks. - Okay fine. Sorry, truly.
enjoy it. - There's a back.
wait, truly, what?
there's a back door and it's propped open. We could just sneak in.
look at you, acting all grown up and figuring out how to sneak in places, wearing short dresses and acting age-appropriate. I'm so proud of you.
I look away for one second - and he's got a pile of salami.
no, the guy with no arms had arms a minute ago.
they're on the side there, see?
the effects aren't super great, so it kind of looks like salamis.
if I had a nickel for every arm
you're funny.
we're leaning against a wall. - It's cool
Yeah, it's something.
it's been a long time - since I've stood in back and watched a movie.
wait.
truly frances abigail dominica iii, did you sneak booze into this movie truck?
I stole it from sam's desk at sparkles.
I worship you.
we gotta go. - What?
it's 11: 40. My house alarm sets at midnight and it doesn't go back off until 6: 00 a. m.
we need to get boo. - I'll do it.
what? - Michelle is here.
Oh my god, it's another arm. It's like ed wood!
it's like someone literally went to a warehouse looked around, saw 50, 000 arms and thought,"done"!
tank top! - Drink.
Hey, we should make a movie. "skyscraper of teeth"!
ziggurat of legs! - "The tower of torsos.
Yes!"tower of torsos"!
Hey, talia was in a movie called that.
it was called "blood dungeon two.
same thing. And she took her top off.
Really? - Which is why I was killed in the first scene.
first boobs equals first kill. - What killed you?
I have no idea. I don't think anyone knew exactly, but it was large, it glowed and I slept with it after we wrapped.
she'll tell madame fanny. - Maybe she won't.
we could sneak past her.
she's 18 feet tall, she's totally going to see us.
well, is she a narc? - She doesn't look narc-y to me.
she could be a covert narc, like she acts like she's your friend, you hang out and do narc-able things with them, and then you go home and you've been totally narced.
so what do we do?
we wait for the movie to be over and they leave, then we run back to my house.
I think his chainsaw died. - Excellent.
I thought it was really poetic how the killer cut off his own arms to finish the mountain, but then there was no way of getting them to the top.
okay, someone get boo so we can go.
found her. - Excellent.
wait! - boo!
mountain of arms! - Oh my god, right?
mountain of arms"!
Oh my god. Did she see us?
I don't think she saw anything. - We have to leave.
I have to thank charlie for the tickets.
Hey. - She's trying to kill me.
11: 55, how fast can we all run? - That's it, i'm getting her.
Hey. - Oh, hey, boo!
Hi, I just wanted to thank you for the- - oh, gimme your hand.
my phone died and my hands are greasy from the popcorn.
text me that when you get home, okay?
okay.
come on! - I can't look. What does it say?
Shari" and then shari's number.
who's shari? - That's shari.
that's totally what dita von teese looks like.
we definitely didn't get that right, boo. Sorry.
Yeah, it's a real tragedy. Let's move!
wait, where are we?
more importantly, where did we park?
we parked near a tree that looks like a hobbit.
all the trees here look like hobbits.
I like that word "hobbit." Hobbit.
it has a nice in-my-mouth-feel when I say it- h-hobbit.
Oh, there's my car!
I'm thinking we should walk home. - Or sleep here.
Yes, sleep is genius.
I could take off my shoes and start sleeping.
No! You said we would stay up all night and it hasn't been all night, so you can't take your shoes off.
but I wanna. - Me too.
cupcake a. t.m! - Truly?
did you say "cupcake a. t.m."? - I read about it.
in los angeles there is a pink a. t.m.
and it dispenses all kinds of cupcakes 24 hours a day.
who is she? - I have no idea, but I like her.
problem is we made Mr. Tom collins go bye-bye, all empty.
and I may have drunk all the bitters.
I'm sober. - Unpossible. You matched us drink for drink.
Yes, and then I spit it back in the bottle.
Oh my god! - I'm not a drinker.
back in the bottle?! - Seriously, that's disgusting.
but it's a good thing 'cause I can drive, so we can go get a. t.m. Cupcakes, right?
back in the bottle?
uhh yeah ha.
okay.
cupcakes!
it's 12: 15 - no, 12: 16.
it is?
Yes, I've been yelling that at you - for the past three blocks.
I thought you were saying "run faster.
12: 15" doesn't sound anything like run faster.
it's blinking red. - Damn it!
can we turn the alarm off? - From the inside.
let's do that. - Yeah, mel, let's do that.
everyone think real hard and use all your psychic powers to turn the alarm off.
are you doing it? Okay?
is it working? No?
Really? Shocking. - Sorry.
I knew we'd get caught if we snuck out.
just lemme figure this out.
over here!
there. - Yes?
we'll get up there and climb in.
Oh okay,- lemme get my catapult.
if there was a tree to climb maybe.
or a mountain of arms. We can make a mountain of arms and climb up that.
the car, you idiots. We'll climb up the car.
that's never going to work.
boo, boo. - Okay.
Yeah, talk to the window, that will help.
you know what? I'm trying to save us all from lectures and groundings, so you can either help or shut it!
did you grow in the last 10 seconds? - No, I'm gonna jump.
Oh okay, this I'm gonna wanna get on video.
Oh my god!
don't wake my parents up!
I had an idea. - You did.
none of you had ideas. - This is true.
I could
all righty then.
and then she suffocated 'cause all her pores were clogged?
Yes.
that is going to happen to me, but in reverse.
frosting is going to clog my pores from the inside out.
I will stop breathing and colored sprinkles will shoot out my nose.
how many did you eat? - Oh my god. This many.
this many.
you could always out-eat me.
you could always out-dance me.
yeah well, that was then.
arms. - Frosted arms.
Oh god, please tell me she remembers her dreams.
look, she kept her heels on the whole night.
the student surpasses the teacher.
so on the birthday scale?
this one definitely cracked the top 10.
Really? Wow.
not the top five, but
I think it knocked out the time that we broke into that temple and skinny-dipped in the mitzvah baths.
so how does it feel getting older?
fantastic. I like getting older.
some women say they don't, but me,
I feel like every time a part of me sags lower to the ground, an angel gets its wings.
it's nice you're still drunk. - I think it's the bitters.
Oh, last one. - Split it.
60/40? - Fine.
a cupcake a. t.m.
a 24-hour cupcake a. t.m. - What a country.
it's sweet.
it's supposed to be sweet. It's a cupcake.
no. I mean this. - What?
this place, this town, your pad. You have a gazebo.
Fanny has a gazebo.
your ass is sitting in it right now.
true, very true. - I love it here.
you do? Don't you?
you know, this was supposed to be a whole different thing here.
this was supposed to be a whole different life.
I was supposed to be married- a sadie.
I was supposed to have a husband
and we were supposed to- - To what?
I don't know- Be really happy.
now I don't know what the plan is.
you can't be really happy here without being a sadie?
so next year...
for my birthday- - I promise I will be more prepared.
I'll do some planning. - Okay.
I'll check out what's going on in the other towns.
is there more to solvang than windmills?
there's not.
I'll check out carmel, scope out the night life in los olivos, see what the kids are up to in carpinteria.
and I'll see if I can't liven this place up a little bit before then.
if anybody can...
three more minutes.
boy, those two can sleep in any position, can't they?
Oh jeez. Hey!
pathetic. - No, don't!
forget him, boo. You'll meet someone else just as dumb, driving just as crappy a car any day now.
I was supposed to text that to him. - And then what?
and then he would thank me.
and after he thanks you for texting him some other girl's number, then what?
I just like him. - I know.
you're probably right though. - I know.
look one more time and the hand goes too.
so I got my letter today... From the joffrey.
the official invitation.
Yeah.
well, you knew that was coming.
it wasn't 100%. 0 So are you going to go?
I'm certainly not going to stick around here all summer.
what did your parents say? - I'll tell them when I get back.
look, they won't even notice I'm gone. Trust me.
you can't just up and leave.
I'll leave a note on the throw pillows.
but- - It's time.
C'mon! Let's move it!
dad?
I stayed out all night and wrecked mom's car.
good night.
I remember this song being much shorter.
thank God she's back tomorrow.
Fanny extended her trip. She's not coming back until next week.
What?! - Still no Sasha today.
I know, missing class.
maybe she finally got in trouble.
we thought you were in military school.
no, we didn't. We just thought you got busted.
they gave you a credit card for being a jerk.
what did I miss? - We're talking about Fanny's rules.
Oh, you tell her about walking on sand?
she has rules for everything.
swimming, piano lessons, reading... all fine.
no eating after sundown. Avoiding direct sunlight.
you know you can't even be a minute late for class...
Fanny's rule, not mine. - Fanny's not here.
she's not here, but her class is, her studio is and her rules sure as here are.
another Saturday. Boned.
when are we ever going to have a weekend off?
when we're 40 and too old to enjoy it.
we have ballet all morning...
and then a fun-filled three-hour leadership conference at school.
I had to sit through that last year.
a million community leaders yammering on and on and on.
our community has leaders?
just wait till you experience Pete from Pete's pesticides and his take on punctuality.
it's inspiring.
Hi, girls.
boo, what are those for?
they're for madame Fanny. It's a welcome-back bouquet.
what's wrong? - Those are freeway flowers.
you can tell? - They're already turning brown.
and there are more daisies than roses. That's always a telltale sign.
and all this baby's breath screams "cheap.
baby's breath is the curly parsley of the flower world.
isn't it the thought that counts?
remember Kate Hutchins? Little redhead?
she brought freeway flowers one year.
Fanny thanked her, put them in a vase, then poor little Kate got pushed farther and farther to the back of the class.
till she was all the way out of the building. Then her parents sold their house.
in a really bad market.
Hi, everybody.
freeway flowers? - Grocery store.
what?
well, hello there. And how are you this fine day?
I'm good. I am very good.
I must say, I am nothing but good... and you?
I'm good too. - Good!
I'm just grabbing some food.
my little kitchen is still not up and running. It's not even up and limping.
Ah, damn. Out of cayenne pepper.
my eggs are nothing without cayenne pepper.
there must be more somewhere.
I have no idea. I haven't cracked the secret storage system around here.
Yep, same as always.
shoves the spices down behind the sandwich bags. Why?
Yeah, why? - It's just awkward.
very.
do you know who in the hell I am? - No.
I'm Michael. You must have heard about me.
only that you rode your boat ashore, hallelujah.
she said you were funny. And quick too... I like that.
we're talking Fanny, right?
who else would we be talking about?
so she's back? - She sure is.
okay, catching up here.
listen... join us for breakfast.
I always make three times what anybody could eat.
Oh, no, I couldn't... I mean, considering where you're headed with that tray,
I don't think you want me around.
I'm setting us up in the dining room.
Oh, the dining room. Okay.
that's a terrific place to eat breakfast.
I just thought with the robe that you were heading back to Fanny, and that she was still in bed, and I was thinking, "what is this... kinky breakfast day?" You know?
no, not really.
all three of us having breakfast in bed... that queen-sized bed up there?
I'm not a prude. I mean, I've had breakfast in all kinds of places...
some kinky, some not. Most of 'em not.
I really don't have kinky breakfasts much.
good for you.
doesn't get much less kinky than this.
have a good one.
you too.
paradise
ginger Rogers was so glamorous.
it's like she's floating, not dancing.
she could talk too. She was funny.
they talked faster back then. It's funnier when it's faster.
and they would shoot a whole dance sequence in just one shot. No editing.
Oh, well, hello. When did Mr. Scorsese get here?
you know what I mean.
because I want him to explain "Kundun" to me.
she's so beautiful too. She exudes sex.
Yuck! - Sorry.
that's just what my mom says when she sees Matt Lauer.
double yuck!
I used to think that actors in black and white movies went home to black and white houses and lived in black and white worlds.
you sound like a sad Dr. Seuss.
Hey, look. I'm Ginger Rogers. I thought I was Ginger Rogers.
we can both be Ginger Rogers...
are you okay? - This is a rough business.
you know, Ginger Rogers did everything that Fred Astaire did, but she did it backwards.
and in high heels.
any other brilliant cliches you'd like to hit us with today, Boo?
a penny saved is a penny earned?
it's not the heat, it's the humidity?
I didn't say I thought it up, Sasha.
so have you and Jordan rehearsed the Astaire/Rogers thing yet?
a little. We don't want to rehearse too much.
trying to keep it fresh.
whoa. Three whacks. - She's in a mood.
let's show 'em some. - You got it.
who needs rehearsal? - You don't.
that was great, Jordan. - I know.
okay. Let's gather.
quick, quick, everyone.
welcome back, madame Fanny.
I'm never gone. I'm always here.
Yes, ma'am. So are we.
okay, everybody listen up because we have a lot to catch up on.
as my veterans know, we are fast approaching show season.
I love show season.
summer is our busiest time for performances.
we have our usuals coming up.
the regional mall tour at the end of July, the strawberry festival.
the Ventura County arts fair will be an overnighter, so I'm going to need some parents to tag along.
then it's our Nutcracker at the end of August.
why do we do our Nutcracker in August?
costumes are half-off.
but our first performance of the season is for the grand opening of Paradise Gourmet Foods, and it's a biggie.
they're building a beautiful stage for us and we're giving them a full ballet exhibition, closing with the Astaire/Rogers dance.
Madame Fanny, what about the Arroyo Grande beach party?
not happening this year.
their arts council decided to go with an exhibition by the Southern California cheerleading champs.
to each his own.
that can't be all.
wait for it.
what the hell does cheerleading have to do with art?!
and there she blows.
if cheerleading is art, then so is yodeling and plate-spinning.
if those morons at Arroyo Grande want to see squatty girls with thick thighs do their grotesque handstands and flimsy acrobatics, then fine! Let 'em!
their grand finale can be a chicken pecking out of tune on a toy piano
that'll wow 'em!
where was I?
you were talking about the Paradise Gourmet Food store opening.
Yes, that's in two weeks, and we have a lot of work to do.
Sasha, what happened here? - What do you mean?
turn around.
you have tan lines. - Yeah, I got a little sun.
I'm not happy about it. - Me neither. It hurts a little.
you know the rules about members of my class and the sun.
they are not to come in contact with each other.
it's hard to avoid sometimes.
walking down the street, yes.
but clearly you were in the sun in a bathing suit.
now if I were training you for a career in radio, that would be fine.
but dance is a visual medium, and it's show season!
I'm sorry.
want to try that again?
I apologize. I'm very sorry.
boo? - Yes?
you're doing the Astaire/Rogers dance this year. - What?!
but Sasha always does it. She and Jordan are...
places at the barre.
first position.
demi, demi, grande. And demi.
and straight. Demi and straight. And grande.
there she is.
Hey, Fanny. Welcome back.
half my plants are dead. - They look fine to me.
you clearly did nothing to help the garden while I was gone.
the gardeners were here. They did it all.
the gardeners mow, blow and go.
I didn't catch their names, but that could be them.
I mean, couldn't you see they were distressed?
the gardeners or the plants? - Michelle.
Fanny, you don't want me touching your plants.
plants and I have a history... a bad history.
the killing fields? That was me. I killed those fields.
well, clearly I'm going to have to show you how to deadhead peonies for the next time I'm gone.
okay, I can't wait to explore the exciting world of peony deadheading.
good. Oh, and I've got tickets to the matinee of a play tomorrow in L. A.
I want you to go with me.
in my new role as your spinster daughter? - Don't be snotty.
I'm just saying I'm very busy with my needlepoint this weekend, then I was going to use my quill pen to write a letter to cousin Henry in Manchester.
I thought you liked theater. That's why I asked.
I do like theater, but you didn't ask.
well, sounds like you're free. I'm paying for the tickets.
the play's supposed to be good, so what's stopping you from going? Me?
no.
I love theater, and you're not stopping me from going.
so yes, I will go with you.
good. It's supposed to be very funny.
it's called "Blank up, it's time."
"Blank up"? What does that mean?
well, the blank is some vulgar word, so that's how they have to print it on the tickets.
"Blank up, it's time"?
okay, I'm scrolling through my mental list of filthy words here.
that doesn't make sense.
that's funny, but it doesn't make sense.
I got a lot of filthy stuff I'm working through here.
I have no doubt.
Ooh, getting to the obscure ones now.
Ooh, hello, haven't thought about you in a while, you cheeky little devil.
Nope, nothing makes sense with that title.
well, then... one more reason to go.
you'll be able to solve the mystery of the title.
so there was no one else for you to go with?
no special friend?
I took Colleen once to "The Sound of Music.
she hummed off-key to every song, then got so confused she ended up rooting for the Nazis.
no, I meant a special friend. You know, a cayenne peppery friend?
you mean Michael? - Yes, Michael...
the man you've been hiding from me.
I wasn't hiding him from you. - Well, you didn't tell me about him.
I didn't tell you about the marshmallow vodka I bought, either, but you managed to find that just fine.
so why isn't he going?
he'll tag along to musicals, but he doesn't like straight plays.
he thinks they're boring.
so tell me about him. Who is he?
he's a very good friend of mine.
he was sporting your slippers. I'd say he's a very good friend.
I've known Michael for... longer than I want to admit.
he's a pianist, a fine one.
he tours a lot, and whenever he's in the area we spend time together.
he seemed nice. - He's wonderful.
we keep it casual and it all works out perfectly.
wow, very good. I approve.
I wasn't looking for your approval.
so you'll swing by in the afternoon, and we'll hit the road?
you're driving. - Had an inkling that was the case.
clarity of purpose, motivation and teamwork.
those are the three.
so first, what is clarity of purpose? - That was stupid.
we're out, aren't we?
but I think walking backwards out the door to create the illusion that we're actually walking in just drew more attention to us.
especially when you dropped all your leadership materials and went,"ta-da!
I hear no alarms. I see no search dogs. We're free, ladies. Rejoice.
so what do you wanna do?
we've got a prescription to pick up.
can't your mom do that for you? - Then I'd never see it again.
is the Katy Perry movie still out?
I'm sorry. I'm not sitting through that woman squirting things at me in 3-D.
there's gotta be something.
hold on, I gotta get something outta my locker.
you might want to stand back a little when you open that.
Why? - An enraged Sasha may jump out.
she was Black Swan before you took her Ginger Rogers.
now that makes her Def Con Swan.
she's got nothing to lose.
I didn't take her Ginger Rogers. Fanny gave it to me.
Sasha doesn't get too analytical when it comes to placing blame.
she's a little more result oriented.
and the result is you got the part.
but I didn't even ask for it.
we're hanging in the school hallway on a Saturday. This was not the point.
we'll meet you outside. - Okay.
I do not approve of this. - Of what?
of bringing wine into a theater.
well, I love getting sloshed at the theater.
but we're both performers, so the theater is sacred ground.
this is our church.
churches have wine. Jesus made it out of water. Ever hear of it?
I saw "Jesus Christ, Superstar," of course I've heard of it.
this is our row. And that's us.
excuse me. Pardon me. Thank you.
excuse me. Those are our seats.
those are our seats. Excuse me.
excuse me, excuse me, I need to get to my seat.
then you should've gotten here a little earlier.
uh, the play hasn't started yet.
can you believe this? - Just squeeze through.
I can't. This woman's built like the Panama Canal.
well, the Panama Canal opens, doesn't it? - The nerve.
come on, we're blocking people.
I guess I'll just have to power through.
coming through here. Coming through!
are you kidding me? - What are you doing?
honey, I don't think I'm gonna make it.
did you see that? I was caught between that woman's giant legs!
keep your voice down. - Why? Am I being rude?
you're here five minutes and you're already having an argument with someone.
maybe you should've brought the friend who hums the songs and roots for the Nazis.
the woman moved for me, that's all I know.
that's because her legs are like a stuck pickle jar.
I loosened them for you.
Oh God. - Give me that!
it's matinee crowds, you know? - What about matinee crowds?
they're different than night crowds. They're older. Crankier.
just calm down and read your program.
Oh, I know one of the assistant costumers here.
she helped me with "Nutcracker" last year.
good for her, getting this gig.
so you've taught your first ballet class since getting back, right? How'd it go?
fine. They're all a little rusty.
and how was Sasha? - Sunshine sweet.
she's definitely going through a phase.
that's going into its third year.
so what's the strategy?
I've already cut her from a dance she's doing.
that delivered a message. Sasha's never been cut from a dance.
you cut her from "Nutcracker"?
No! I need her for "Nutcracker. " This was something else.
but she got the message. Trust me.
Oh, here we go.
slow reader... figures.
what's that? - My own secret recipe.
the brownie's just our regular brownie, but I made the topping:
whipped cream, crushed cherries, cocoa powder...
and tabasco? - That's the secret.
it's good. - It's on the house.
Thanks.
so you're, like, talking to me. - Of course I am.
you're not mad about the Ginger Rogers thing?
Nah, I've done Ginger. Done her to death. I'm fine with you doing it.
Really? That's great.
can I ask you something? - Sure.
you never go in the sun. - Yes, I do.
you don't. You hate the sun. - I love the sun.
I've known you since you were four.
we met in line in kindergarten and your parasol hit me in the eye.
kind of a cute meet.
why were you in the sun? - Because I wanted to be.
you hate the sun. - People change, Boo.
but... - People change!
I didn't make you mad at me, did I? - Not yet.
I've got to get back to work. - Thanks for the dessert.
torrid, I'd call it.
I don't know what you're getting so upset about.
the house! The house! I'm upset about the house!
Mormons? - Russell.
I'm confused. - Me too. Which one was Mirabelle?
the redhead, I think. - I thought that was Catalina.
which one was Russell? - He was the guy at the door.
Yes, but did we see him earlier? - Oh God, I don't know.
there are too many characters. - And too many plots.
I wish it was a mormon at the door.
a singing mormon. Are you using the restroom?
I'm fine. Are you? - Yes.
then shouldn't you go?
no. For I am going to utilize the Ortega maneuver.
the what?
a choreographer I worked with, Kenny Ortega, taught it to me.
it's surprisingly simple:
instead of rushing to the ladies' room and getting into that ridiculously long line, I take my time.
the line works its way down.
then as soon as they play the sit down bells people panic, leave...
I dash in at the last second, do my thing, dash out, bing-bang-boom,
I'm back in my seat, didn't have to suffer the line.
sounds very simple.
like, why would someone even have to think that up?
I'm going to start slowly getting into position. You'll watch my seat?
why, what's it going to do? - Just watch it.
no one's going to take your seat.
please just go the other way. I beg you.
no. This is personal.
excuse me. - Oh, I'm getting up too.
victory!
so is it cocktail time yet?
No! No no no no no.
it started? - Sorry.
this is not my fault.
I utilized the Ortega maneuver and I had it all timed out, but you know what?
there are a couple of Sunday matinee variables I did not foresee.
one, an older matinee crowd is way less predictable than a normal crowd, what with the canes and the walkers and the "pardon me.
and they can't hear the sit-down bells.
it is an older crowd.
and two, guess who was hogging the last stall at the last second?
I mean, long after she had finished her business.
I wouldn't know.
the lady with the big legs. Oh, you've seen her. The big East-European leg woman?
shh, please. - I'm never late for a curtain. Never.
you should arrest that lady.
Oh, and of course, she got back to her seat.
Ugh, I hate that big-legged lady so much.
there's a scene change in about five minutes. I can get you down then.
why bother? Crazy big legs probably won't get up, and I'll be this big jackass blocking everyone's view as I'm stumbling over her.
it's no problem.
you know, the only reason I had to go to the bathroom was because I drank a ton of Fanny's wine because I was so mad at that big-legged East-European lady.
this has so sucked.
well, you're welcome to watch from back here.
thank you.
Oh no, terrific. Stay there just as long as you like.
never mind the fact you should have crossed three fricking beats ago.
what?
Russell, that lawnmower was brand-new.
Oh God, shoot me now.
what was wrong with that?
she's carrying the book in her downstage hand.
she does that every time. I correct her every time.
it looks okay to me. - It's not, okay? It's not.
director, right? - And imminent suicide victim. Conor.
Michelle. Hi.
I wish I was.
is this going to Broadway?
not like that.
must be hard getting through an out of town tryout.
slowly saw through each of your fingers with a razor blade dipped in vinegar... it's more pleasant.
what brings you to the old lady matinee?
an old lady. Well, she's not that old, not compared to a lot of people here.
I count eight asleep and three dead.
Hey, can I ask you a question? - Sure.
what is this about? - I have no idea.
no, really. - No, really. I have no idea.
the playwright thinks he's Eugene O'Neill. This is Ed O'Neill.
it's got its moments.
they're accidental and it's definitely a bad audience.
the ladies with the brawny East-European legs come to these shows.
wow, you heard that, with everything going on?
I need something to entertain me.
...Violinist who never heard of an arpeggio?
she thought it was a type of pasta sauce.
why didn't you laugh at that? - I didn't think it was funny.
I added that line. - Then I loved it.
Oh, don't do that.
go ahead. Scribble some more.
so big legs skedaddled?
Michelle, where have you been? - I was stuck in the back of the house.
I was worried. - Really? That's nice of you to worry.
I was worried that you'd left without me.
Oh. Nope, I was in the back with the director.
long story. Nice guy. Going through hell, poor thing.
I can drive myself back, you know. - Why?
if you want to sleep with him.
I'm not sleeping with him.
Why? There are ways for you to get home. There are busses.
I'm not going to take a midnight Greyhound bus home after having quick sex with a guy I just met in the back of a theater, thank you.
it doesn't have to be quick.
that wasn't my point.
you may want to reconsider. He's a director.
he could get you a role.
I'm not looking for a role.
there are taxis too, if you don't want a bus.
although that'll cost a fortune. Could he drive you home?
I don't know if he has a car. And I'm not sleeping with him!
okay. I just don't want you to miss a quick boff on my account.
you know, hearing that, I do feel comfortable having a quick boff with him.
perhaps in the alley.
and if it's that quick, you and I could still go home together.
fine. Anything less than 20 minutes and I'm willing to wait.
piano's out of tune. - I just had it tuned.
well, the deaf guy missed something.
he wasn't deaf.
you hear that? That is not one note. That's three.
so it's a chord. Music has chords.
I've got my tuning lever, I'll fix it myself.
you hurt your hand the last time you fixed it yourself.
do not touch my piano.
okay.
so what madness do you have going on here today?
that's my Firebird, a staple of all my mall shows.
that's my "on the town" group... a big crowd pleaser.
and that's my Ginger.
I'll be right back. Boo!
Yes, madame Fanny?
I want you to begin practicing with your Fred.
great. Jordan's here?
it's not going to be Jordan.
Oh. What happened?
he, um, had to drop out. Family matter.
that's your partner. Carl! - Carl?
Hi, madame Fanny. Hi, Boo. - Hello, Carl.
so you're going to be my Fred Astaire. You up for it?
am I up for it? Hello. I will channel the man.
I'm there. I'm already there.
I'm not even here anymore. That's how there I am. I don't know how I could possibly...
now I'm going to start with my "On the town.
why don't you two watch the tapes of Sasha and Jordan, do what you can and I'll fill in the rest later?
you got it.
I'm plotzing.
well, get some water. I'll be right back.
Madame Fanny? - Yes?
I was just wondering... Do you think Carl's right for this?
of course he is. It's my job to know these things.
I'm not questioning your knowledge or anything, but I was just thinking, don't you think there's a certain something... Lacking?
well, he lacks Jordan's skills.
And? - And what?
height. - So crouch a little.
while dancing backwards in heels?
I'll have him jump a lot. That'll even it out.
now go on, make the best of it.
Madame Fanny, would you mind if I called him? - Who?
jordan, and asked about his family matter? - Boo...
it better be a death, that's all I'm saying.
boo, listen to me, Jordan is special.
every dance company in the Western hemisphere is clamoring for him.
he's very talented and...
Oh, let's face it, a giant egomaniac, as most talented male dancers are.
I wouldn't take it too seriously.
he didn't even give me a chance.
look, Boo, I'll admit Carl is rough around the edges and not your height.
but what he lacks in everything, he makes up for in enthusiasm.
he wants this so badly.
he loves it more than anyone in this room.
and sometimes enthusiasm is enough to create magic.
or a train wreck.
it's nice to give the unexpected person a shot once in a while, don't you think?
I guess.
try. For me? - Yes, ma'am.
why does everything always happen to me?
tough break.
expecting Jordan and getting Carl. - Little Carl.
you went from Rogers-Astaire to Rogers-Dinklage.
don't you think I should have been consulted?
I mean, really. I'm Ginger Rogers.
Madame Fanny does not consult.
maybe from a distance it won't look so weird. - It's gonna look weird.
you won't really be dancing cheek to cheek.
more like cheek to yawning-gap- over-his-head.
don't make this worse.
it'll be like that Stonehenge bit from "Spinal Tap.
you might accidentally trod on him.
it's all about the pituitary gland, you know.
what is? - Dwarfism. I did a paper on it.
he's not a dwarf. - He's close.
think he'll grow beyond this? - Probably not.
he definitely should not take up cigar smoking.
a cigar's never going to look right in his hand.
he's already texted me four times about rehearsal and he's still downstairs in the dressing room.
he's got a lot of energy.
he kind of reminds me of our dog. We have a really small dog.
I just think I should have been consulted. I'm Ginger Rogers.
that's showbiz, Ginger.
I told you it was gonna be close. - You did, you did.
that calls for some wine.
Oh, come on!
is the man blind? - That was a swing.
I'll lose a game, but not to the ump. - Hi, guys.
Hey, Michelle. Are you a White Sox fan? - Nope.
Ah, Cubs fan. My condolences. - Not a Cubs fan.
if you're an Indians fan, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
she doesn't follow baseball.
I'm sorry, then what's the point of living?
she doesn't follow any sport.
I follow the Kardashians. That's a sport.
never knew you were a baseball fan.
are you kidding? She can rattle off stats with the best of them.
guess I've just never heard her stats-rattle.
picked him off!
he wasn't supposed to be on base in the first place.
definitely. Definitely.
I will leave you to your game. Enjoy.
I'm going shopping tomorrow. Want to come with?
Yeah, I'll tag along.
I'll get you some socks. - I don't want any socks.
you need socks. - Fanny, I don't want any socks.
trust me, you need socks.
I have to work.
Oh jeez, Carl! You scared me half to death.
sorry.
don't call me Bettina, okay? - But that's your name.
call me Boo. Everyone calls me Boo.
fine. I like Bettina, but Boo it is.
those are the parents. It's been a little tense in the Cramer household.
not hearing much lovemaking these days.
I'm just sayin'.
so you wanna hear my Stewie Griffin?
I really am busy, Carl.
okay, just give me your email.
I want to send you links to Astaire-Rogers dances. There's a bunch on YouTube.
you don't need to do that.
Fanny's choreographing the dance and we have the Sasha-Jordan tapes.
she told us to bring some ideas to the table.
they do this one dance where Astaire is hypnotizing Ginger, so I've been working on my hypno-stare.
don't do that.
I think if we keep it simple, we're gonna wow 'em.
sure, we'll keep it simple. You don't have to do that.
I don't mind. You're actually going to be a better Ginger Rogers than Sasha.
Oh, no way. Sasha's great.
she's got ballet brain. She can't adapt. You can.
more water here! - Got it.
a "please" would've been nice to hear.
you're crazy.
I should get back to the Bickersons. You good here?
Yeah. Thanks, Carl.
you're gonna want to hear my Stewie Griffin. Mark my words.
Hello, you two. - Good morning.
Hey, Michelle. What are you up to?
I was just going to grab an orange or some stale melba toast or a flavored toothpick.
something to keep body and soul together.
forget that. Come join us.
Oh, I wouldn't want to impose.
who are you to say no to a kinky breakfast?
Yeah, you know, Michael, I kinda misspoke when I said that.
come on, get in here. Sit in my chair, mooch.
Oh well, when you sweet talk a girl.
I was just going to get some more coffee. Be right back.
don't do anything kinky while I'm gone.
really, Michael, it was a dumb thing to say.
I don't even want to know what you're talking about.
I like him. - Me too.
Where'd you meet?
in a dirty jazz club in Monterey.
I sat in the back... at first.
then I saw him and I worked my way down front right in his eyeline.
he lost his place a couple of times.
you show-wrecker. - That's me.
was he married? - He happened not to be.
well, let me ask you this... you guys are so in sync.
you're watching baseball, you're eating on TV trays, and I've never seen you smile so much.
why haven't you made it more permanent?
it is permanent. We've known each other forever.
but it's permanently not permanent. Why is that?
when Michael and I met, Hubbell's father had just left us,
I was not looking to rush into a long-term relationship. Neither was Michael.
but in all the years since?
we did talk about marriage once. When Hubbell was about 10 or so.
but Hubbell had a fit, broke the model airplane he had been working on.
it was a very big deal, so we dropped it.
he was very young, it was understandable.
and you never revisited?
no. We never revisited.
he's a troubadour, you know. He doesn't even own a house.
you're kind of his house.
some more kinky coffee, ladies.
I'm never gonna hear the end of this, am I?
probably not. - Pour away.
it's open.
this door should be locked. - Why?
you're alone. I want you safe.
well, you're late.
I stopped to get us some Cel-Rey tonic.
I had to go to five different stores to find it.
I love Cel -Rey tonic.
I know. - How do you know?
I heard you say it once to someone a couple years ago.
and you remembered? No way.
so did you watch the footage of Sasha and Jordan?
it made me feel small.
well, we're not them.
but look at it like we're a different interpretation...
the everyman's version.
we are the street version of Fred and Ginger.
sounds good.
now the foundation is just waltz. We can waltz.
but I want to start with something kind of flashy before we actually dance together, is that okay?
you lead, I'll follow.
I'm gonna start with my back to you.
and I'm gonna have a flower and I'm gonna smell it.
like that.
then I'll turn and see you and I'll toss the flower away.
then I'll step, hop, step, hop hop, step, turn...
I should include "get dizzy" at the end of that 'cause I'm freakin' dizzy.
you should definitely turn less. - For sure.
so after the intro and I've turned less, we're waltzing, we're waltzing. And are you ready?
for what? - A dip!
we gotta give 'em a dip or two. We can do dips, right?
definitely.
so when did I say I liked Cel-Rey tonic? Was it really two years ago?
you were talking to Ginny.
school just got out, so it must have been June.
you were wearing pink shoes. - I still have those shoes.
shall we continue? - As long as you want.
Hello? - I cut the joke.
Conor? - Yeah.
I cut the joke you didn't laugh at. It was a miracle cut.
Oh stop. - No, I'm not kidding.
it was one of those magical little changes that opened the whole scene up.
now the Catalina character seems less like a dolt,
I have Russell exiting sooner.
the scene just flies now.
Wow. Maybe I missed my calling.
you want to come down and see it? - See what?
Knott's berry farm. The play, what do you think?
tonight? - Tonight.
we'll watch, we'll marvel, we'll grab a bite after.
sure. I'll be there.
great. You know how I know when I'd been in L. A. too long?
how? - I'm starting to like it.
there might be other reasons.
see you tonight. - See you tonight.
Russell, what should I tell the police if they come sniffing around?
and then what shall I tell y'all?
did you just say "y'all"?
damn straight. - Catalina, is it worth...
beat me with a crowbar. - Why is he stepping on every line?
I told him to jump on his cues, not mug them. - You gotta put that joke back.
they would kill me if I put that joke back. - You need some funny in here.
I swear it worked last night. - And this audience... dead, right?
comatose.
he can't open a door. - It's sticking on him.
that's sets, right? We've gotta get sets on it.
I got it. - I got it.
I got it.
roo - So you were an actor. - I was.
I bet you were good. - I was. That sounded arrogant.
theater? - A lot of theater. Too much theater.
my feet hurt just thinking about it.
just theater? No TV?
no, I did some TV. But you know what I never got? "Law & Order.
I thought every New York actor's been on "Law & Order.
not me. And I went up for all of them:
the mothership,"S. V.U." "Criminal Intent,
parental neglect, special weird guy unit... nothing.
unbelievable. - I know.
in this world you either look like a rapist or someone trying to catch a rapist.
how did I fall between those two categories?
I say wear it as a badge of honor.
you're the guy who never got on "Law & Order" despite countless attempts.
what about you? Did you ever act?
a little. I was in a feminine product commercial.
Oh, this I want to hear about.
it's got wings!
what the hell was that? - My line.
that's glorious!
and it was after I did a somersault.
why were you somersaulting?
there were a bunch of us in a grassy field.
we were all supposed to be blooming or photosynthesizing or something.
please tell me there's a copy of this.
there may be a screening in the future if you play your cards right.
you know I was nervous when I called you.
you didn't sound nervous.
I utilized my acting skills.
very impressive. I'm glad you called.
Yeah, me too.
it's been awhile for me... doing this.
sleeping with a director? - With anybody.
same here. - Quite awhile.
are we talking years?
no, but awhile. Months, not since...
not since? - Since...
Oooh, oh my God. Oh...
whoa whoa whoa, are you crying?
what is this? - I don't know.
what is happening? - I don't know.
what did I do? What did I say? How can I unsay it?
I was not anticipating this. - Me neither.
this was going so well. - It was.
how can I reverse it? I mean, what can I do? Make you laugh, what?
sure.
okay look, there's not enough room for the somersaulting, but...
it's got wings! " Oh, that did not go well at all.
where is this coming from? - I don't know.
you were just saying you hadn't been with anyone since...
Hubbell, okay. That's your rosebud or your very large telescope.
Hubbell. Poor Hubbell, he's gone.
where did he go?
Oh, he is not with us any longer.
he's not. He's gone.
I'm sorry. - No, it's...
it's doing this, the last time was with him and then he died and now it's all welling up.
boyfriend? - Husband.
I was in shock.
I'd never been in shock. I didn't even know I was in shock.
and then I was dealing with his mother and she was in shock then I inherited all his stuff and I had all this paperwork and I guess it all must have gotten buried and now here it is.
I'll say it's here.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
no no no, it's... this is good.
this is what we try to write and what we try to convey and, wow, are you conveying it right here, right now.
it's not nice to the guy to cry after sex.
well, it's different, I'll give you that.
poor Hubbell.
I'm beginning to feel bad for the guy.
he was a good guy, a good man. I should go.
no no no no... stay here as long as you want.
thank you. I'm so sorry, I am so sorry.
no, it's okay.
what?
think about having the Tony character spill something at dinner at act two so his clumsiness doesn't come out of the blue at the end.
Oh, that's good. No, that's really good.
Michael, stop. - Stop what?
you do all the cooking, let me clean up. That was the deal.
I'm just trying to expedite things here.
give me that.
okay, I'm just warning you, if I sit on that couch out there, I'm gonna fall asleep.
then stay in here with me.
you'll let me do that. - I will let you do that.
then I'll help you dry.
so...
how long were you planning on staying?
I don't know. Maybe a week?
I should check with my manager. See if I got bookings.
I hate talking to my manager.
I know.
so why were you asking?
I was thinking, maybe this time...
don't rush off.
I wasn't gonna rush off.
good. Stay... as long as you want.
as long as you can.
you're not gonna get sick of me?
no.
I miss you.
then I'll stay as long as I can.
good. - Good.
wow, glamorous. - It feels a little tight.
well, if it rips, pretend it's a part of the act.
Where's your partner? - Over there.
he looks ridiculous. - Like an organ grinder's monkey.
he doesn't look that bad. - He's no Jordan.
tell me he's not going to wear a top hat.
it kept falling off in rehearsal.
mind if I sit in?
no, please. Michael's sitting in too.
great. So...
what is it? I'm already behind.
nothing, I just...
I just was thinking about Hubbell last night.
Hubbell? - Yeah.
and I just thought that I'd tell you.
thank you. - So I'll see you after.
Hey, Michael. - Hey, Michelle.
missed you at kinky breakfast. - Will you stop?
kinky breakfast is just not kinky breakfast without you.
I said it once.
and it will live forever.
this tie is driving me crazy.
you look very dashing though.
thank you.
you know tonight, you should come over and watch "That's entertainment" with me.
I'd loan it to you, but it's my mom's and she's not into loaning.
I'll whip us up a lasagna for dinner.
you can whip up lasagna?
from scratch. My grandmother taught me.
how a life-long Jew learned how to make a killer lasagna,
I don't know, but she taught me and it is the best.
so what do you say? Tonight, 6:30?
quick answer for you, Carl... no.
Yeah, come on, dude, get a clue.
what are you talking about?
she's not your frickin' girlfriend. She's your dance partner, which means she's not going to come over to your house for your sad lasagna.
boo, step in here. You don't even like lasagna.
the cheese does something bad to my stomach.
see? No loser lasagna tonight.
yeah sure. Sorry, Boo.
idiot. - They just get dumber every year.
break a leg.
okay, everybody.
this is a loose dress rehearsal. Don't be afraid to make mistakes.
we'll start with Fred and Ginger, then it's "On the town" and "Firebird.
so anyone who's not playing Fred and Ginger should be off the floor.
come over here right now. - I'm fine where I am.
Sasha! - Whoa whoa, honey, this is Fanny's world.
what makes you think you can sashay in here like this, your hair ruined...
it's not all about you, Fanny.
in here it is all about me.
it's my hair. I'll do whatever I want with it.
no. - Yes!
No! You already got one warning...
you can't tell us how to live every stupid moment of our lives.
No! I'm talking. - It's not fair!
I'm talking! - I get to talk too!
you already got one warning, and to come in here like this...
I'm not the only one sick of all your stupid rules!
we all are! We can't even go swimming?
stop right now, stop!
I don't need this!
Oh really?
No!
I'm going out for cheerleading and I can't do both.
you're right. You're absolutely right.
you can't do both. Cheerleading and ballet.
get out.
what about show season?
boo, Carl, dance!
make sure you really change your weight on your feet.
all right. Great job, everyone.
clap for yourselves, please.
and the ghost of Donald O'Connor applauds you as well.
don't say that name. Don't ever say that name.
wow, what's with Maybin? She just bit my head off.
you didn't mention Donald O'Connor, did you? - Yeah.
big mistake.
Hey, question... when is the adult tap class doing a recital?
well, I'd say probably never.
what? Why?
the shorties do recitals all the time.
Yeah, but the shorties have a built in audience. You guys don't.
are you saying people wouldn't come to an adult tap recital?
they might if it was an adult film star tap recital.
well, then maybe not a recital, but we have to do something.
Oh, I know. How about a tap dance flash mob?
a tap dance flash mob? - Yeah yeah.
like we run into Nordstroms without warning and we surround that dude playing the piano, and then we do a shuffle step, a couple of stamps, add a flap heel, - and then we throw shoes at him. - Why would you throw shoes at him?
I don't know. 'Cause we're mad at him for some reason.
maybe we could set up some sort of performance in town that wouldn't include an assault.
well, I'm open.
see you.
Hey.
what happened with Maybin and Donald O'Connor?
Oh, it's dark. Really dark.
Oh, and don't mention Fiorello Laguardia or Bob Barker around her either.
trust me.
Hey, Michelle. Hi.
Hey. What are you doing here?
I totally blew at class today.
I just couldn't nail that move you showed us... that fouette into the attitude turn.
Yeah, it's tricky.
Yeah, so I thought I'd come down and rehearse a little.
I like it when it's empty and quiet.
didn't mean to interrupt anything.
no, I was just taking off. The place is all yours.
just lock up when you're done, okay?
sure, thanks.
how are things at home? Parents still fighting?
at the moment, they're just not speaking, so we're going through a much-needed quiet period.
well, I'm proud of you. I hope you know that. - Proud of what?
just making it through Joffrey, being back here with everything going on.
it's been a long road. - Very.
and I hope you know that if you ever need someone to talk to, or just a place to hang...
Thanks.
so is he outside or still on his way?
who? - Dude.
outside. - Yo, Roman!
Hello, Roman. - Hello, Michelle.
you getting taller? - Maybe.
you're getting taller. - How did you know?
Oh, little one, I have done all that you have done or shall do, thought of all you've thought or shall think.
I am all-knowing. I am Michelle.
can I go? - Yes.
got leftovers at my place, you hungry? - I can always eat.
I swear he's getting taller. - Maybe.
he's definitely not getting shorter.
not bad.
ladies, use your center.
partnering is not just on the guys, it's 50-50.
very mediocre.
Eric, Edgar, you're losing steam.
guys, Swan Lake, three hours long. Remember that.
getting worse. Getting worse.
okay. Let's do it again.
come on!
okay, okay. All right.
nice work, everybody. Nice work. I'll see you tomorrow.
apologies to the guys.
guys? What, you're not even talking to me?
is this it? Is our relationship over?
Talia, hey. - Open the e-mail I just sent you.
that's a fine how do you do.
just open it now. It's top priority and time sensitive.
all right. Hold your horses, Claire Danes.
what am I looking at? - Our friend, Marion.
Oh, so it's a photo. It's fuzzy.
it's the best photo we had of him.
it's a him? - Of course it's a him.
his name's Marion?
John Wayne's given name was Marion, at least according to Marion.
it's a very fuzzy photo. - It's not the best, I'll grant you that.
is Marion being attacked by a giant moth?
that's his beard. - His beard has wings?
Michelle! - Why am I looking at this?
cause you're going out with him. - Talia, no.
Yes. He's going to be in the Paradise area and I told him all about you.
you know I don't do blind dates.
it's not blind. You've got a picture.
of a woman with a moth eating her face.
he's actually a very attractive real estate developer.
and where do you know Marion from? - He's a friend of Rick's.
your boyfriend Rick? Rick is in his 60s. How old is Marion?
Rick said he's way younger than him.
have you seen Marion in person? - I'm trusting my Ricky on this.
nothing about this smells good.
give it a shot. What can it hurt?
does he have teeth? - Rick's friends have teeth.
maybe not the ones they were born with.
I'm so ridiculously stressed.
Shh! Trying to read a book here.
why are you staring at me?
just drinking in the picture.
and sweaty. Look how sweaty I am. I'm practically dripping.
I mean it. Super trying to focus.
shoot. Is George Wilson Myrtle's husband or brother?
he was supposed to arrive tonight.
Carl? I had his homecoming perfectly timed out.
then he went way out of his way to catch an early train because he wanted to get home to me as soon as possible.
boo, that's sweet.
Carl was away at camp all summer and he missed you.
that's insulting.
when am I ever going to get another opportunity?
coming home early totally messed up all of my perfect planning.
I was gonna get a manicure.
I was gonna have one of those baths with the scented bath bomb.
and I was gonna get my hair done, and I was gonna...
never mind. - You were gonna what?
I don't want to say.
is it some sort of down-there grooming?
shut up. You do not know about things like that.
well, clearly I do.
brother... George is the brother. I knew that.
I don't even know what to wear.
I brought a couple of options. I need your opinion.
this one's cute but summery, this one's a little sexier.
Natalie Portman's my role model. Which one would Natalie wear?
I like the first one. - So do I.
and I think Natalie would too.
summery it is. - Melanie!
are you well? - Yes.
she fell behind in her summer reading list for school.
and the books aren't helping.
I'm halfway through this thing and the stupid whale hasn't even shown up yet.
there's no whale in "The Great Gatsby.
are you joking?
where the hell is this stinker going if there's no whale?
many's a night F. Scott pondered that very same question.
Oh, shoot.
I left the bag with all my makeup downstairs.
I'll just get changed at home. - Wait, Boo.
what were you talking about before with Matisse?
shaving above my knees.
Oh, Boo.
later.
surprise! - Carl! What are you doing here?
I got lucky and caught the super early train. Actually got up before reveille.
come here. - No.
what are you doing? - I'm gross.
put those down. - No.
I want to hug you. - No.
boo, stop. Come on.
Carl, I just finished class and I came straight here from The Oyster Bar.
I was manning the vats. - I don't care.
I smell like zucchini sticks. - This is ridiculous.
it's not fair to lie about a train.
wait wait. Hold on here.
is there something else. Something you're not telling me?
I switched deodorants. I'm very unsure about this new deodorant.
no, Boo. We were apart for six weeks.
is there anything you need to say to me?
like what? - You know what.
look, I have nothing to confess to.
I was good. Not that Camp Wannapamothpa is a hot bed of sexual activity, but the girls' camp is just a quick swim across that lake.
and guys were swimming across that lake at night.
it's not safe. But I never did.
so what about you?
no, nothing.
I saw "Magic Mike" twice.
that's it? Really?
all this is because you smell? - Yes.
great. And I totally get it.
Channing Tatum is a fine actor.
kiss me quick then step away.
cool. - Wait, don't breathe in.
there will be better kissing after the bath bomb.
excellent.
Oh, and hey, Thursday night's still good, right? My mom needs to know.
your mom? For what?
for dinner. You're meeting the parents.
did we make that plan?
before I left. It's the perfect time... before school gets too crazy.
and I was gonna meet your parents. Is none of this ringing a bell?
no no no. It's ringing a bell.
my mother's been talking about this for weeks, so are we on?
sure.
good. It'll be fun.
and take this with you.
while everyone else was swimming and fornicating,
I carved this for you because you like "The Hunger Games" so much.
it's crude, but it'll do some damage.
Thanks.
I'm glad you're back.
me too.
I'll see you when I'm clean.
Bye.
help! Michelle, help.
truly? Truly, what are you doing, selling things door to door?
it's a long story. Can I come in, please?
yeah yeah yeah. It's open.
did you just see Katniss run by?
Oh, with a bow and arrow? Yeah.
will you grab that, please?
what a nightmare.
did you not think it's strange that Katniss ran by?
no. This is a nightmare.
truly, what's going on here?
well, I went to take all this to the shop. It's my new fall line.
and you're liking the polka dots this year. - Very much.
and I went to put my key in the door, and it doesn't fit.
that's a recurring dream I have.
that I go up to my place, but it's only sorta kinda my place, all my stuff's there but it's got 80-foot ceilings and weird wallpaper, and I go to put my key in the lock, only it's totally the wrong shape.
do you want to hear about my story or not? - Yes, go on.
it's my stupid landlady. She locked me out.- What? Why?
no reason except that she hates me.
but she can't do that. You have a lease.
Yes-sss.
truly, do you have a lease?
no.
so you're paying her month-to-month?
Yep.
I mean, when I was paying her. - You haven't been paying her?
this is not the time for judging, this is the time for hugs.
facts first, hugs later.
I had a lease, for five full years, and then she sent me the new lease and she had raised the rent so much
I got mad and I threw it into the fire.
you were reading it next to a fire?
no, I lit a fire and I threw the lease in.
wow, you really wanted to burn that thing. - Very very much.
I know I don't have a fireplace, so I had to find an Irish pub.
and then I had to buy a pint, 'cause it's rude not to after you use their fireplace to burn your lease... and it's sexual by the way.
what is? - Your dream about the key. Blatantly.
look, Truly, focus for me here.
your behind on your rent, you don't have a lease, this is not good.
I know. It's very bad.
I tried to talk to my landlady about it, but she's not answering my phone calls and I can't get an appointment until March.
so you want to leave your stuff here for awhile?
can I?
I just need sometime to think and regroup and figure out how I'm going to come up with an extra $1200 a month.
Absolutely.
I have a little room in my armoire.
we'll hang them up nice, and we'll figure this out.
Thanks. - This is really cute.
I love the color. How much is this?
$1200 a month?
let me think about it.
all the freshmen look so young!
were we ever that young?
looks like a particularly stupid crop this year too.
it's that deer in the headlights thing. It's unattractive.
Hey, what are you listening to? - Hey don't.
she got through "Gatsby," and now she's listening to the audio book of "The Scarlet Letter" while she reads "Fahrenheit 451.
Yeah, "Fahrenheit 451," the book burning thing.
ray Bradbury was onto something there.
what are they? - Newbies.
but not freshmen.
everybody's staring at them.
Wow. She shook her hair just like in a shampoo commercial.
what's with the flowers?
they didn't even bring pee-chees.
truly?
sorry, I couldn't wait any longer. You sleep so late.
well, I'm generally up late.
wait, you don't have a morning show?
a what? - A morning show.
I used to watch Matt and Katie and Al and Anne, and then Matt and Meredith and Al and Anne, and then Matt and Anne and Al and Natalie, and then I tried Charlie and Gale and Seth and Nora, but when I found George and Robin and Josh and Sam, I felt like I was home.
what can I do for you, Truly?
I have a big favor to ask you.
I have a valued customer. Her name is Jill and every year I give her a special pre-peek at my fall line.
and if there was any way I could bring her by, it would be so great.
Yeah, sure. Bring her by.
great. Come on in, Jill.
Oh, she's here with you now. Okay.
so, here we are, Jill. It's a little unusual.
eclectic as we say what with the unmade bed.
but you are the first to see these, and of course I can tailor anything just for you.
truly, I am loving the colors here.
the colors are gorgeous.
will you excuse me just a second.
she's not really into the hard sell.
I wasn't hard selling her. I think the colors are gorgeous.
the colors will speak for themselves.
so the colors do the hard selling.
this is my business. Please respect it.
okay.
so, Jill. I will leave you to browse in peace.
and just let me know if there's anything you need.
I'd love coffee if you have some.
cream or sugar, Jill? - Both, please.
sorry.
sorry.
sorry.
it's the new girl again.
so she's French.
she's speaking French.
does that make her French?
I swear I saw her speaking Japanese to Mr. Yamimoto earlier today.
she even looked a little Japanese when she was doing it.
weird. Very weird.
she changed her clothes.
her name's Cozette. - Interesting.
and her brother's name is Frankie.
Franny and Zoe. - No, Frankie and Cozette.
keep going, Boo.
he's supposed to be a brilliant violinist.
Ginny saw him playing piano.
he wasn't wearing that tie before. - Or those pants.
and she speaks Spanish?
and Japanese and French.
and he plays the piano and the violin.
I think I need to sit for awhile and clear my head.
that only happens in the movies.
today's a good day to order the fried chicken.
we change the grease the first of the month.
Oh, but I like the taste of old grease. It's got wessonality.
sorry. - This'll do.
Hey, take a look at this for me, will you?
I'm not gonna say any more about it, just give me your thoughts.
well, it's a car. - It's a human.
those aren't headlights? - Those are eyeballs.
she's cute. - It's a man.
is something eating his face? - This is happening, yes.
who is this? - It's a potential blind date.
a close friend of mine is trying to set me up with him and she knows me, so he might be great, but I get nervous around new people, you know?
Absolutely. - I either clam up or I talk too much.
that's a tough balancing act. - But I'm not meeting enough people.
I should probably be going out more, right? You know, taking more chances.
I'm soliciting dating advice from a 16-year-old, aren't I?
I'm 17 now.
Oh, well, happy birthday.
could I ask you for some advice?
uh... I...
Carl wants me to meet his parents. - Yeah, I didn't quite say yes.
I don't know what to do. - Well...
I'm freaking out a little.
okay okay. Let's see. Meeting the parents.
well, Boo, my first piece of advice would be "don't go.
I have to. - Oh.
well then, my second piece of advice would be "don't go.
I have to.
Oh, well then, my third, fourth and fifth piece of advice would be...
I got it, thanks. But I have to go.
all right, all right.
well, let me just say this.
the key to getting along with Carl's parents... - Is to be myself.
what are you, high? No.
the trick is to be whoever it is you think they want you to be.
and to say whatever it is you think they want you to say.
trust me. It's the only way.
so, don't be myself? - Right.
well, that's good, because I really don't know who I am.
well, there you go.
and keep an eye on your watch because I'm telling you, 90 minutes in to the second, - evenings like this go south fast. - How so?
well, you could slip and tell an off-color joke. I did that once.
or you could get drunk and call your boyfriend's dad a pickle-puss.
I did that once. Or you could think it's funny to move the dog's mouth around and make him say dirty things.
I did that once.
you're not drinking, so that'll help, but at that 90-minute mark cut if off.
I don't have a watch.
it's got a timer.
use it. - Thanks.
I've gotta get back there.
he's only got one nose, right?
I hope.
Hi.
pass the string beans. - We're out of string beans.
we're out of string beans? - And now it begins.
I knew we would run out of string beans.
excuse me, kind sir?
it's a Cramer family tradition. First, we never order enough food...
three orders of string beans. - Three?
...then order too much. - Sweetie, why three?
because they're small. - I don't want the leftovers.
they heat up nice. - Whatever we order, we eat.
Carl has a guest.
no doggie bags. If I see one of those tin foil animals, it goes straight in the trash.
boo, you'll eat more food, right?
uh, yes, Mrs. Cramer.
call me Sweetie. Everyone calls me Sweetie.
you don't have to call her anything if you don't want.
one orange chicken, happy family in a bird's nest.
find a happy family to eat it, will you?
scallion pancakes.
do you like pork, honey? - Yes.
Oh, 'cause I do not. - Neither do I.
well, which is it? You like pork or you don't?
well, I used to like it, but just now when I said I did,
I was remembering the time that I did... Like it, but I don't anymore.
unless someone else wants some and then I... - Just order the pork, mom.
this is why the whole world hates us. - Nobody hates us.
mu shu pork.
and that'll do us? - That'll do us.
Oh, that'll do us. And them. And those people over there, and the waiters in the back and their families. And four blocks in Solvang...
just ignore him. He's having a stroke. Thank you.
so, Boo.
what do you got going on here? What is this?
my face? - Are you Jewish?
I could be. - She's not Jewish, mom.
but what is going on there?
I'm seeing a lot of Eastern Europe? Maybe Poland, Hungary?
do you like Eastern Europe? - Depends on the era.
Hey, did I tell you about the first hiking trip I did in Maine?
there was a bunch of us, and we were just getting to the peak of first ridge...
Carl, I have heard the story of you and the bear and the running down the hill.
I do not need to hear the story of you and the bear and the running down the hill again.
neither does your little girlfriend.
now I am here to get to know her. Not you.
so, Boo, does your family ski?
Yes. - Really?
God, I hate skiers. - I mean, no.
Oh, really? 'Cause I was gonna say I hate them because they get to ski.
I would love to ski. I never learned how.
Oh, well, we ski. And we love it.
I love it. Skiing.
well then maybe you could teach me. - No.
okay.
what did you do? - Washed my hands.
you canceled the string beans. - I don't want leftovers.
boo wanted those beans, didn't you, Boo?
you know, mom, you probably don't remember but you've seen Boo at a couple of my dance recitals.
she was the girl mopping the floor with the rest of us.
Carl raves about your dancing.
I'm not that good. - She's great.
who's your favorite ballerina?
she loves a bunch of them. The list is long.
is your name Boo?
so who do you like? Gelsey Kirkland?
Yes.
terrible cocaine problem.
no.
no? She didn't have a terrible cocaine problem?
maybe.
she wrote a book... a whole book about cocaine, about snorting cocaine, about quitting cocaine.
mom, please? - Shush.
now come on, honey, you're a ballerina, surely you have a favorite.
who's your favorite?
90 minutes.
what?
time for me to go to the bathroom.
you set an alarm to remind you to go to the bathroom?
you okay? You need to go home?
let me take you home. - I'm fine.
I'll be right back.
what kind of a person sets an alarm to remind her to go to the bathroom?
mom, can you back off? You're making her nervous.
Oh please, she showed up nervous. - Well, you're not helping.
Carl, this girl, she's very nice. - Don't do this.
she's like a loaf of unbaked bread. - That's not fair.
this woman has no opinions. - Stop.
she skis, she doesn't ski. She's from Poland, she's not from Poland.
she never said she was from Poland and you don't know her.
but you better get to know her because she's the one I like.
more than like. I could marry this girl.
get a good job. She eats a lot of beans.
what are you talking about, marry this girl? You're in high school.
what the hell is going on in there?
I'm not talking to myself, dude.
any idea what's going on in my house?
I have no idea.
okay, and Sasha's not here, so scram.
Yep.
just a 24-hour turnaround on all alterations, ladies.
you are running dangerously low there, Jill.
Oh, well, you know what to do. - Do I?
truly. - Such a charming space.
it's a work in progress, but it's really getting there.
sue, that blouse is so you, I don't want it on anybody else.
truly! - Would you ladies excuse me for just a moment.
don't I at least get a glass of wine?
wine is for customers.
so, did I know about this?
about my fall open house? I meant to give you a flyer. Here.
on the back is information about a winter hot chocolate party
I'm hosting in December.
bring the kids, 'cause there's caroling.
truly, this is not your shop.
Lucy, I have an Audrey Hepburn hat that would look sin city-sational with that skirt.
when are you going to talk to your landlord?
Mmm, never. - Never?
but, Truly, this thing we got going here, it's gotta end soon.
Oh, great, I went from one mean landlord to another?
I'm not your landlord. - Truly.
how's that size working for you, Nancy?
it's too big. - Too big?
Nancy, skinny girl, you are now officially a six.
no. - Yes.
No! - Yes! Nancy, you're a six! Accept it!
I will get you that six tomorrow, Nancy.
she's a six. - Truly.
I mean it here. - Okay.
okay, I know I need to talk to her, but she's just so intimidating, and I hate that scary office of hers.
and if I have to look at that stupid picture of her playing golf with Condoleezza Rice one more time...
well, how about you meet her on neutral territory?
like the Oyster Bar? - Maybe.
and I'll go with you for moral support. How about that?
Really? - Anything to get my place back.
I'm not sure if this is appropriate, but how much for this?
I'm sorry, but you're right. That's not appropriate.
I'll take 50 bucks.
what's the matter with you, Boo? You seem pensive.
