Sotomayor: so if the video producer says this is not a human being, it's an android computer simulated person, then all they have to do is put a little artificial feature on the creature and they could sell the video game?
Sotomayor: why isn't that obscene in the sense that you're using the word, or deviant?
Sotomayor: would a video game that portrayed a vulcan as opposed to a human being, being maimed and tortured, would that be covered by the act?
Sotos said that although "interrogating" lincoln's dna still remains some distance off, the concept is potentially crucial.
Sottera inc., an arizona e-cigarette distributor that joined the lawsuit as a plaintiff, and some of its rivals say their products are merely recreational alternatives to cigarettes and that they haven't marketed them as tools to wean people off nicotine.
Sotto, trying to ease his way past humboldt to adjust the sail, knocked a book into the water.
Sottos envisions the materials being used for structural applications such as airplane parts, car and spacecraft components, and for everyday products such as cell-phone and laptop cases.
