Hey, guys. Derek said that the Sandersons got into an argument on the night of the murders.
so, I went ahead and did a background check.
there is no history of abuse, domestic calls, therapy.
from the outside in they were like the perfect family.
nobody's perfect.
Yeah, but married right out of college, medical school, 2 kids, house on a hill, dog.
pretty damn close. - Yeah?
OK, so one night they argue.
he takes the couch, leaving the wife and kids upstairs vulnerable.
he claims the offenders broke in through the basement.
there were security bars on the window, but they were old and broken.
that was such an obscure fact, though.
it was deemed only someone with an intimate knowledge of the house would suggest that as an entry point.
Yeah, but that means that 3 people walked past Sanderson while he was sleeping on the couch.
why didn't he wake up?
and why would they walk right past him without subduing him?
it looks like their goal was upstairs.
she had a stuffed animal.
who does that to a 5-year-old?
you know, the child was an afterthought. The overkill was on Mrs. Sanderson.
like what?
he's in control. He has all the power.
and he hates her.
you must be exhausted.
doing good time just so you can get out and kill again.
I'm not a murderer.
you are a murderer.
you just stabbed a man to death.
I didn't have a choice.
he saw me, he panicked, he would have killed me.
I'm telling you, I didn't have a choice.
he didn't kill my family.
he was going to lead me to the one who did.
all right.
and if you had gotten to this person that allegedly killed your family, what were you gonna do then, the same thing you just did to Tom Wittman?
no, I'm not a killer.
OK, yes. Yes.
there wasn't a day that I was locked up where I didn't hope that whoever took my family's lives was dead.
I wanted to find him and I wanted to destroy his life like he did mine.
I wanted him to payÔºÅ
why wasn't Tom Wittman's name mentioned at your trial?
I didn't even know it until years later.
agent, what I saw and what happened, that couldn't have been random.
so what did you do?
just look at every single person that knew your family?
Yeah.
how did you do that?
you never once asked for access to your case.
all of it was my memory.
I walked through that night a million times.
Tommy was just a kid then, 18, 19.
he worked at the corner market and brought our groceries home.
he and his friend, they would look for any reason to be near my wife.
I didn't like that.
Carrie told him so and he stopped coming by.
so Tom felt abandoned by your wife and angry at you, so he acted out.
Yeah, you see, except... That night he said - He said," that's enough."
see, it's like he had actual boundaries.
that's how you narrowed this down, to somebody who cared about your wife?
Yeah.
Tom-Tom, he was just- he was just- He was a figure in the dark.
and then I heard his voice.
good morning, Mr. Sanderson.
and that was familiar.
it took me a long time to place it.
anyway, a few years later, I called the market and tried to find his full name.
I had internet privileges once a week, and I found his address.
and then what?
a few days later, that heroin was planted in my cell.
I lost my privileges.
so Tom Wittman was the only link that you had to figuring out who was in your house that night?
and now I'm back to nothing.
not necessarily.
you want to take him back to his house?
if he can't figure out who else was there that night, there's no way to prove his story.
all right.
let's clean him up first.
this used to be a great place to live.
you ready?
Yeah.
no one stays here long, do they?
you were asleep on the couch?
in front of the fire.
so it was cold.
Yeah.
and pouring down rain.
the TV was on.
what were you watching?
reruns.
I'd been on rotation for 36 hours.
between that and the rain, it took me about just a minute to fall asleep.
what wakes you? - Daddy!
daddy, help me, daddy! Help! Please! Help!
don! - Daddy! Daddy, help me!
No!
shut up!
he's hurting them. - Who is? Tom?
no, the one in the hood.
Tom's saying... - That's enough!
my little girl... She shouldn't be seeing this.
turn away, baby. Turn away.
I can't get to her.
help me! - Shut up!
No! - No, no, no, no!
you stay away from her!
there's a woman. - There she is.
what does she look like?
it's blurry. - Here you go.
she gave Abby her hippo.
my son.
she had my son.
what is she saying?
top it! That's enough!
but he won't. He keeps holding me down.
he's laughing.
I want to keep him. He's just a baby.
put it back.
no. No! - They're fighting.
put it back.
she wants to take my son. - I said put it back!
they could have taken my son.
but she didn't take your son. He's safe.
they must have trusted one another.
we need to figure out who Tom Wittman's friends were back then.
the woman is the key.
she wanted to take the baby.
Yeah.
to build their own twisted family.
all right, keep me posted. - Ok.
OK, the crazy thing about this is that nobody turned on one another.
so they have to have a bond.
maybe they're related.
Tom Wittman didn't have any siblings.
it could be childhood friends.
uh, the only marks on his record are from juvie.
he cleaned up after that.
what were his arrests?
petty stuff.
uh, anything related to breaking and entering?
credit card schemes, retail robbery.
OK, now, wait. That was big in the eighties.
one person would work in the store and the other would use stolen credit cards.
sounds like a team.
Yeah. - Was he arrested with anybody?
I found Tom Wittman's juvie records.
other than him, no one was underage involved in any of his arrests.
maybe they weren't the same age.
the woman wanted to keep a kid.
that doesn't sound like a teenager.
OK, I'm gonna cross-ref the date of Wittman's arrest with others made on that same day.
retail crimes. Shoplifting was very big.
what about a woman who was arrested from the same department store as Tom?
Mary Rutka, 22 at the time.
is she from D. C.? - Born and raised.
did she have any children?
one 19-year-old son.
Morgan, are you back yet?
we may have found the woman.
that's her.
go.
he's going down the fire escape!
I need an ambulance and backup at 751 hindry street, northeast, apartment 402.
it's ok. It's ok. Hold on.
it looks like she fought him.
so some guy breaks in here, kills her, then runs away.
it's pretty risky.
he's hiding something and she was a witness to it.
he's cleaning up loose ends.
well, it looks like he made a mess to me.
how'd you track her down.
she was arrested with Tom Wittman a long time ago.
Sanderson gets out, Wittman's killed, and now Mary Rutka.
the whole thing's a house of cards.
he got away with it for 20 years.
he's not about to get caught now.
any leads?
nothing more than we saw.
well, he knows you're onto him.
what do you think he's gonna do now?
well, I don't think he'd trash the place for the hell of it.
I think he was looking for something and we interrupted him.
it makes sense why she survived until now.
what are you guys talking about?
3 people got away with murder.
how do you make sure no one rats the other out?
blackmail.
it sounds like we need to profile a dormant killer.
a very lucky one. He was essentially given a gift
a patsy in the form of Don Sanderson, and he'll do anything to protect that story.
when someone has a secret this big, everything becomes a lie.
he'll most likely be pathological.
so, we're looking for a liar in D. C.
I thought we were trying to narrow this down.
her son's 19 years old.
he doesn't have a bedroom, but she kept all his books.
she's sentimental.
Hey, Morgan.
almost there.
Ah, sorry.
daddy help you make them?
yeah? - Yeah.
did Josh help you make them?
Yeah, he got the blueberries.
he got the blue - Well, thank you very much.
I love you.
I love you, too.
welcome to the Sanderson home.
don't forget the view.
they look down on everybody.
he sounds jealous.
let's do this. - You'll wake them.
Garcia, can you isolate these images?
Yeah. Which one?
the one in the hood.
you think it's him?
that could be a thousand guys.
I want to see them.
no. I don't think that's a good idea.
I wasn't allowed to have pictures.
for 25 years.
they thought that looking at them would get me off.
I don't want to forget my family.
see, they're - they're here, and they're in flashes.
but I can feel them slipping away.
please.
daddy help you make them?
yeah? - Yeah.
did Josh help you make them?
Yeah, he got the blueberries.
he got the blue - Well, thank you very much.
and the butter. And the butter.
were you I charge of the eggs?
Yeah. I know you like to break the eggs, right?
I love you.
I love you, too.
mommy...
go ahead. Go ahead.
pancakes.
you guys are too good to me.
what we just watched was... - Debilitating. Frenzied.
and documented, but not for a trophy.
it seems to be from Wittman's point of view.
I mean, she's obviously an accessory. Why not just destroy the evidence?
because she got something out of it.
her place was way more than she could afford.
she never got married. And she had a son who went to private school.
do you think it's his kid?
that would explain the bond and why he didn't get rid of her before today.
you said her place was nice.
if he's covering his tracks, he's paying her in cash.
who can afford to do that?
you want me to find rich and powerful men in D. C.?
explain to me how to narrow down this list.
start with me who grew up in the district, came from nothing.
his ambition will define him.
whoever did this enjoys taking power away.
he's been way too smart to keep on killing.
so what would satisfy a guy like this?
well, he's manipulative but trustworthy.
two other people witnessed that murder and they never turned on him.
guys, so we have to think of this city as the unsub's comfort zone.
he didn't leave for a reason.
a target-rich environment.
the damage he's done and continues to do is right here in D. C.
politics? - I think it's more intimate than that.
he needs victims who suffer directly from what he's doing.
OK, I'll cross the politicians off my list.
look into asset-based lenders, uh, big money-making ventures where people would be left in his wake.
corporate takeovers.
businessman as psychopath?
they have the same characteristics. They just use their skills differently.
they both have narcissistic traits, such as a grandiose sense of self-importance, deceptiveness, lack of remorse.
hard-core businessmen, 36 and counting.
that's way too many.
we can each take 6 and look for connections.
no, no. Wait a minute.
if we had this case 25 years ago, what would we have seen?
how would we fight the physical evidence?
we'd look at what the unsub did the moment he arrived at the house.
they broke into the basement, through a window with rusted-out bars.
Garcia, who lived at the house before the Sandersons?
property records... Well, it hasn't exchanged too many hands.
the Barretts, the Kramers, the Stanworths.
any of those names on your list of businessmen?
uh, no. Let me look at that longer list. Hold, please.
Hey, family of James Stanworth.
they lost the house in '82 and then they moved to the outskirts.
he sounded jealous on the tape. That makes sense.
he knew the Sandersons and he would obviously know that house.
there was nothing random about that attack.
a native Washingtonian, married with 3 kids.
everything to lose.
what?
he's running for congress.
check out his campaign slogan.
"let's do this." He said that on the tape.
this won't be easy.
you want to arrest James Stanworth?
are you out of your mind?
he's got motive.
Mary Rutka had a tape. She was blackmailing him.
it was a hooded figure.
you can't prove it was him on that videotape.
he fits the profile, Erin.
forgive me, but your profile sounds like a self-made man, not the psychopath you claim he is.
we said he'd be destructive.
in 1998 alone, he fired 6, 000 people from one of his companies.
some of those employees took their own lives.
this is the type of power and devastation that he enjoys.
hearsay.
slander if you're not careful.
ma'am, he got into politics to be hard on crime.
he would have access to keep tabs on Don Sanderson.
and now you're sounding as paranoid as Don Sanderson.
you cannot accuse a man without a shred of physical evidence.
Mary Rutka had skin under her nails.
maybe she left a mark.
and you cannot arrest a man based on the possibility of a scratch.
we can't arrest this man.
that's what you mean.
don't pull any punches now, Erin.
you don't understand what the politics are, do you, Dave?
you never have.
no, I do. I just don't care.
ma'am, with all due respect, we have an innocent man in our custody, and the killer is still out there.
it just might be James Stanworth.
you don't have enough proof.
the bau functions without you.
don't push it.
no. No, not a chance in hell.
Garcia, find me James Stanworth right now. - Yeah.
another hour passes, he's that much closer to hiding his true self.
Mary Rutka's his third victim. He's now officially a serial killer.
what do you want to do?
I want to expose this son of a bitch.
if he did kill mary rutka, he's gonna have cuts on him somewhere.
we match that DNA, we got him.
guys, he's having a fund-raiser at his house in Mclean.
when?
it started an hour ago.
text me the address. - Yep.
what if we're wrong?
...which is why I insisted they come to D. C.meet the policymakers, see that it's not as simple as signing our names, that the problems we're dealing with are not easy ones, that we have to plan not 2 steps ahead, but 200 steps.
that it's not just about what's in our families' best interests, it's what's in our nation's.
thank you.
ladies and gentlemen, congressman, Mr. James Stanworth.
you sure have a way with words.
it's mighty impressive.
thank you. May I help you?
my name's Derek Morgan.
I'm with the FBI.
do your friends here know that you're a closet psychopath?
excuse me?
don Sanderson knows.
do you remember him? I'm sure you do.
you murdered his entire family and got him put away for 25 years.
well, agent, if you've got anything on me...
no.
James, it's not on you, it's inside of you.
killing mary rutka really got you going, didn't it?
I'm afraid I don't know who that is.
Jim, what's going on? - They were just leaving.
but I don't understand - Don't worry.
he's good at that, isn't he? Anger.
he's dismissive by nature. Can't show affection, though, can he?
you walk on eggshells, you and the children.
here it comes.
where was your husband today around 3: 00?
these are ridiculous fabrications.
it doesn't matter. We know where he was.
I held the hand of the woman he murdered.
right.
James, whoever did kill mary left some dna behind, under her fingernails.
what's that? - Well, that would be a cut.
I cut myself on a broken glass.
no. Mary rutka did that to you trying to defend herself.
he got to Tom Wittman, and you were afraid that if he got to mary, he might find you and bring you down for what you did to his family all those years ago.
you're delusional, agent. - You panicked and you killed mary.
I don't panic. - You did panic.
you're a killer. It's what you do.
you destroy people's lives.
I destroyed no one.
you put a man away for life, you murdered his family, and today you killed a woman - I killed no one. - Who would never betray you, because you panicked.
you are a killer.
you are a psychopath.
you panicked and - I don't panic! I don't panic!
there he is.
Jim, what's going on.
call charles.
don't say another word.
they've got nothing.
we found the tape.
James Stanworth, you're under arrest for the murder of Mary Rutka.
this is absurd.
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
you have the right to speak to an attorney.
if you cannot afford an attorney...
there hasn't been a second when I haven't thought about this.
now it's here.
how does it feel?
I'm terrified.
you know, your son has been studying medicine.
he wants to open his own clinic.
it seems to me he's becoming a lot like his father.
I don't even know what he looks like.
well, it looks like you're about to find out.
Yes, but I... What am I supposed to say to him?
he knows that you didn't do it.
that's all you ever wanted him to know.
Yeah.
go.
show him who is dad really is.
"all truths are easy to understand. Once they are discovered.The point is to discover them."
Galileo.
MIELS CITY, MONTANA
Yeah. It's conforming.
it's not conforming.
it's saying you own me.
that's an old-fashioned way of looking at things.
I don't want to be a possession.
marriage is about... Love and commitment, not possession, baby.
don't you want kids, Sunday dinners?
I like Sunday dinners.
tying the knot would guarantee me front-row seats to the movie of your life.
don't you want someone to...
change your diapers when you get old?
baby, if I ever need diapers, you just take me right out back and shoot me.
don't do it, son.
what are you saying?
marriage. Ruin your life.
why don't you ring these up.
you get married, the romance fizzles, your girl gets fat.
next thing you know you're lying on the couch wondering how come you don't have a bed.
marriage is overrated.
marriage is overrated.
how's it going, stranger?
Oh, I'm a little tired. I went Salsa dancing last night.
Oh, my God, like I need another reason to find you amazing.
this call for you from Sean McAllister came to my phone accidentally.
he sounded very hot and very important.
did he leave a message? No. But it's from Paris.
a Scottish guy calling from Paris.
know this, Emily-- even if he is ugly, Scottish guys are hot. It's the accent.
I'll keep that in mind.
so what's the skinny? Is he an ex?
international booty call? No. He's a friend.
Where's Seaver? She had to take a test at the Academy.
I know we've all seen the news. Mass murder in Miles City, Montana.
6 people shot and killed at a gas station.
robbery? - No apparent motive.
any security footage? No. No cameras, no witnesses, ballistics say we're looking at two shooters. Well, something at the station must have triggered them.
it doesn't look like they had much of a plan. And it may happen again.
spree killers often repeat themselves.
Billings, MONTANA.
we did it, baby.
we did it.
that was awesome.
I love you, Ray.
love you, too, Syd.
friedrich Nietzsche wrote, "what really raises one's indignation against suffering is not suffering intrinsically, but the senselessness of suffering."
I'm sorry to reroute you to Billings, but last night, this went down. Have you released a statement to the press?
no, but it's already hit the air. Where's the car they dumped?
it's over there. Agents are searching it now.
one of the vics said the shooters were a male and a female.
how many people were murdered here?
8. If you add the Miles City killings, we're up to 14.
male-female teams are usually committed to pleasing each other, both mentally and physically. These guys are thrill killers.
they're aroused by the adrenaline rush. So they're not gonna stop until we catch them.
so this is just foreplay.
what's the news saying about us now?
they know we're male and female.
how did they figure that out?
I don't know. There was nothing girly about the way we killed those people.
where do you want to live, Ray?
I told you--Aruba. Right on the ocean.
I like the ocean.
so how do you want to spend the rest of our honeymoon?
exactly the same way that we spent the last 12 months.
till death do us part.
nothing's gonna happen to us, Syd.
I mean, I've seen dead bodies before, but this is insane.
they're like Bonnie and Clyde.
they smashed one guy's vertebrae so bad, it looked like a derailed train.
extreme brutality to this degree is what's known as an obliteration attack.
the unsub wants to completely erase these victims from existence.
both of the vics were shot at point blank range.
what made those? That was a crowbar.
Whew! Baby!
ray, I'm hungry.
the unsubs are becoming more and more confident, which means their weapons are becoming more and more personal.
the excitement of the brutality allows them to overcome their human inhibitions.
why is this one covered?
it's the store clerk. Guy got it pretty bad.
in medieval times, it would just be another Monday.
he was sodomized with a tire iron.
that kind of overkill suggests he was the root of their aggression.
maybe they're zeroing in on what's really pissing them off.
they took the store owner in the back.
they got the schoolteacher over here.
the kid over here thought he was safe.
why chain them in?
they thrive on sadistic power.
there's rice all over the floor.
bullet probably hit a box.
I take it this is the food aisle.
I don't see rice for sale anywhere on these shelves.
who comes to a gas station throwing rice? Ok, I checked surrounding areas.
72 people applied for marriage licenses in Montana in the last 3 days.
any of them have records? 31 do, the rest are clean.
all right. Send over all the names of the suspects with their ages, Garcia.
lover, they're all ready sent. Check your phones.
so you think they're newlyweds? Well, there was rice all over the crime scene, and a bunch of alcohol was missing from the store. So they're on their honeymoon.
what did you find out from the M. E?
overkill on the store clerk and sodomy--object penetration.
Garcia, last 30 days, check any store clerks killed in the states east of Montana.
Wow. Uh, there was a savagely beaten store clerk outside Jamestown at the beginning of the month, and then another one 2 days later in Bowman, North Dakota.
and that's probably where they started.
Thanks, Garcia.
Helena, MONTANA.
Hey, there.
are you drinking all alone tonight, honey?
my company's a little busy.
my name's Ray.
Hi, Ray. - Hi, Ray.
I just got married.
and I'm an alcoholic.
Congratulations. - Congratulations.
I'm just passing through town and I wanted to stop and share because I partied last night.
what do you think made you drink?
come on. I was celebrating with my lady.
that's a big rock you got on your finger there.
I like things big.
I bet you do.
well, I've been drinking my whole life.
I started when I was 8.
my father was an alcoholic.
it tastes like...
grape kool-aid.
Oh, I like kool-aid.
whiskey and bourbon...
were his choice.
after he got his glass, he's come and he'd tuck me in.
first, he'd ask me about my day.
then he'd, uh, he'd move his hands up my leg.
told me everything was gonna be ok.
it was never ok.
20 bucks...
I'll let you have a taste.
Oh, you got a deal.
I'd just bury my head into my pillow and wait until it was over.
and when he was done,
I'd just lie there quietly.
it's nice of you to share with us, Ray.
what step have you gotten to?
7
the same age I was when he did that to me.
well, it's time for you to do 8 and 9.
have you admitted your shortcomings?
this wasn't my fault.
but you've let this one incident dictate your whole life.
I was a kid.
I know, Ray.
but until you let this go, you will always be a victim to the bottle.
to the bottle, to the bottle, to the bottle...
screw you and your bottle.
what happened to him?
he got fresh with me.
this is 100 miles west of the last gas station.
we anticipated them hitting this area, but not here.
maybe this guy tried to have sex with one of our unsubs while the other one was inside. Cheating on your honeymoon.
someone's got a twisted sense of commitment.
so they steal the liquor from the gas station, they go on a binge, and then they come to a meeting?
what if the unsubs met at a meeting?
they hear each other's stories and develop a bond because of their similar backgrounds.
that makes sense. People typically drink to excess because they're unhappy with themselves or their past.
from the looks of it, at least one of the unsubs shot from up front.
run!
well, if the meeting started at 8: 00, and this happened at 8: 45, they were probably in the sharing portion of the meeting.
so maybe they didn't come in here to kill.
you know, what if they really are struggling with sobriety?
if they're really working the program, they could be working on the hardest steps.
which are? 7, 8,and 9.
acknowledge your shortcomings, accept responsibility, and make amends.
the trouble is, these unsubs already broke one of the most important steps.
what's that? The thirteenth step.
members aren't supposed to enter relationships with each other while trying to get sober.
what are you thinking about?
we need to go to the next step.
all this killing and drinking is fun, but it doesn't change the fact that, you know, my father used to rape me, or what your daddy did to you, you know.
what are you saying, Syd?
if you want to find closure, you gotta go directly to the source.
we do 8 and 9?
why not?
we're looking for a young couple from North Dakota, late teens to mid-20s. We believe they may have recently been married.
we're seeing that alcohol plays a significant role in these crimes.
it's allowing them to kill freely and recklessly.
our unsubs are killing surrogates who represent those responsible for deep-seated wounds. Now, these two most likely met at alcohol support.
and they get a sexual charge out of the kill.
the change from gas station to alcohol support meetings suggests one of them might have a slight moral compass that led them to get help.
ultimately, we believe one of the pair is a sociopath, while the other is a psychopath.
what's really the difference?
they're similar pathologies, but a sociopath is less likely to participate in criminal activity and can be lured by a dominant, while a psychopath is a consummate leader and likely to engage and destroy anyone in their way.
the most recent attack was 12 hours ago, which means they're most likely heading west of Helena and towards Idaho. All surrounding areas should be on alert.
this is it?
this is it. This is it. This is your house.
say hi to me, baby.
Hi, baby.
you look good.
this is Ray's house.
Hey, baby. Kiss me.
you look good, baby.
Mmm. Cute butt.
Yeah, can I help you?
say cheese.
Hi, daddy.
these alcohol support groups are based on anonymity.
there'll be no record of who attended the meeting.
Garcia, our unsubs attended an alcohol support meeting last night, but they're not from the area.
can you trace who accessed their website yesterday?
3 people went to that website, one on a mobile, 2 on DSL.
cross-check that with a list of anyone married in Montana in the last 2 days.
no, no, I'm coming up empty.
see if anyone on the list who accessed the site is from North Dakota.
bingo, baby. Ray Donovan of Devil's Lake.
ironic. - What's his story?
he is 27. He's been in and out of foster care since he was 10.
he looks like kind of a lush and a bit of a meanie.
he's had 2 DUIs in the last 2 years.
he was slapped with a restraining order by an ex-girlfriend.
sounds like our boy. What's her name? She might be his partner.
no, she's not. Her name's Amy Wichowsky.
she died a year ago of an overdose from a mix of alcohol and heroin.
Garcia, get us the address of the foster home. Somebody there might know something.
sure. Give me a sec.
I talked to all 4 of Ray's foster families.
they say he was removed from his parents' home because of drugs and abuse.
Garcia. - Yes?
can we confirm that with the biological family?
OK. I'm gonna patch you through.
I want you to take the ninth step.
take the ninth step? Why?
I didn't do anything.
I was put into foster care because of you, you bastard.
you were put in foster care because of our drug problem.
ray, no one molested you.
put the gun down, Ray.
shut up! Take the ninth step or I'm gonna shoot you, dad.
I didn't do it.
I didn't touch you.
ray, you're my own flesh and blood.
I never touched you. Don't you lie!
I said I'll take care of it.
I swear it.
take the ninth step.
I ain't taking no step.
take it.
take it.
I ain't gonna ask you again.
No!
why did you do that, Syd?
cause you wouldn't.
I would have. Look what you did.
come on, Ray.
look what you did, Syd! - Come on, Ray.
look what you did! It wasn't for you to do!
this was mine, Syd!
all right, so Ray must have been sitting right here, playing Russian roulette with his dad.
Mr. Donovan was shot from across the room.
ray couldn't have done it sitting there.
maybe he got mad, went over by the door, shot him from there.
we NEED TO TALK.
you all right?
Yeah. It's nothing. Uh, what if Ray didn't do it at all?
what if the girl pulled the trigger?
well, why would Ray let her do that? He was the one with the grudge.
ray kept asking Paul to take the ninth step.
take the ninth step.
it sounds like they're making amends, but they're twisting it, trying to force people who have wronged them to make amends to them.
Mrs. Donovan, did you hear the name of the girl that Ray's with?
he kept calling her Syd.
Syd, I think.
maybe she's the one calling the shots.
she's the psychopath.
well, if she did do it without his consent, they're going to be at odds.
the first marital fight is supposed to be the worst.
well, it just might be the wedge that we need.
Ray... Please don't be mad.
baby. Baby! I need a minute.
let me talk to you. I'm going to tell you I'm sorry.
he touched me, not you.
baby, just take it out on me.
come on. Just take your frustrations out on me. Come on.
come on, baby. Hit me. Hit me.
stop it, Syd! Hit me.
stop it, Syd!
Yeah. Yeah.
do it. Do it.
when I say I'm gonna handle something, I will handle it.
I understand, baby. I am the man in this relationship.
I just want to make you feel better, baby.
Syd, a man takes care of things.
you understand me? Huh?
I understand. I understand.
I understand.
I'm serious, Syd.
I am, too. Mmm.
Yeah. Yeah.
OK, so, no Ray Donovan filed for a marriage certificate.
however, I looked at that list again, and there's a Sydney Manning of Washington State who filed for a marriage certificate 2 days ago in Montana.
washington State? We profiled North Dakota.
Yes, she's lived in North Dakota for the last 4 years, and it gets better, or worse, rather. It turns out that Sydney was sentenced to mandatory rehab after serving time for a hit and run during which she was under the influence of alcohol and heroin.
Oh, so she didn't volunteer for alcohol support.
no, she was placed there as part of her parole. Alcohol and heroin.
isn't that the same combo that Ray's ex O. D.ed on?
Yes, it is, my friend.
so both Syd and the ex have the same vice.
Garcia, check to see if there's an juvie records of the ex we can access.
Amy was pulled out of High School so she could go to rehab for alcohol dependency. But no mention of the heroin?
what are you thinking?
psychopaths will destroy anything in their path. What if Amy was in Sydney's way?
Garcia, where is Sydney Manning's biological family?
Spokane, Washington. And why was she pulled out of her home?
her father was molesting her.
so Ray and Syd did meet after sharing similar backgrounds in alcohol support.
and if they're sticking to the pattern of making amends, Sydney's father's next on the list.
Reid, you stay at the command center in case they double back.
the rest of us are gonna go to Spokane.
Spokane, WASHINGTON
this is about to get crazy.
can I help you?
Hey, daddy.
how you been?
what are you doing here, Sydney?
have you heard of the ninth step?
what?
I got no idea what you're talking about.
making amends.
why don't you just put the gun away.
see, I don't want to put the gun away.
I want you...
to touch me.
what are you talking about?
I want you to touch me.
you used to like it.
Syd, put your skirt down.
I ain't puttin' down Jack.
what's the matter, daddy?
you don't like the way I look?
you're out of control.
no, no...
you were out of control.
listen...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I hurt you.
I've changed.
I've found God.
God?
where was he every time you'd take me to that back room, huh?
I don't know.
not here. I don't know.
not here.
every time I'd hear that door chime, somebody's gonna come save me?
it never happened.
God was nowhere near this place.
please.
what do you want me to do?
there's nothing you can do, you sorry piece of crap!
Yeah, baby.
daddy? Daddy!
what are you doing to my dad?
may I help you? Mrs. Manning, we're with the FBI.
is your husband home? He's at work. What is this about?
your daughter Sydney-- we think she's planning on hurting him.
Sydney? That's Gary's kid.
he hasn't seen her in years.
can you tell us your husband's work address, please?
uh, 785 Halbrook Street, off Kirkland Road.
he owns a gas station.
thank you.
please, Sydney, don't do this. - Daddy!
I never hurt her I never hurt her! Of course you didn't!
he didn't, I swear. Daddy!
Hey. Hey. Daddies don't do this to their daughters.
Hey, it's ok. It's ok. We're gonna get you out of here.
Hey. Hey, honey.
you'll change your mind.
I did.
I want my daddy! My daddy!
Prentiss, get down! It's them! Get back!
ray, they got me. They got me, baby.
you'll be ok. It's not that bad, baby.
she needs a doctor. I know what she needs.
get me some whiskey. There's no alcohol in here.
you're kidding me. My dad doesn't drink. He says it's against the Bible.
you don't have to protect him anymore. He's gone.
get her a water.
get her some water!
what do you want?
Mr. Donovan, how you doing in there?
how do you think I'm doing? You shot my girl.
no, it was one of my agents. He didn't have a choice.
he had a choice. He could've shot me. Now put him on the phone.
I can't do that. Yes, you can. Put him on the phone.
he needs to fix this crap.
Hello, Ray. You know, if you come out, we can get Sydney to the hospital. She doesn't need a hospital.
she's strong. Don't be stupid.
you don't be stupid.
now get your men out of here so we can continue on as planned.
we can't do that, Ray, and you know it. You got a little girl inside.
and God only knows what happened to Sydney's father.
justice happened to her father.
so he's dead? Damn right he's dead, and his kid's gonna be, too, if you don't get me a car to take us to Aruba.
all right. Let me see what I can do about that.
is there anything else you need in the meantime?
some gauze and some booze.
and none of them cheap kind, either.
it has now been 2 hours since Ray Donovan and Sydney Manning locked themselves inside this Spokane gas station.
two hostages are thought to be inside, the owner of the station and his 10-year-old daughter.
what do they want?
liquor and tickets to Aruba. They're delusional.
you're not negotiating with them? No, but we're gonna let them think we are.
does she look like me?
I think she does.
I don't know, Syd.
don't be scared. We're not gonna hurt you.
Syd... What grade are you in?
shh, Syd. You need to preserve your energy.
fourth grade.
I liked the fourth grade.
stop talking to her.
relax, Ray, we're having a family reunion in aisle 3.
be supportive.
move back!
move back or I kill this girl.
back off! Back off!
I will shoot this kid!
back off!
back!
kid, unlock that door. You got it?
put your hand on the lock. Just unlock it.
got it? - Yes.
OK. Yes.
ray? Take it easy, man.
take it easy. - You take it easy.
put it down!
all right. Put it down. We got you the stuff you asked for.
we're working on the rest.
great.
if you need anything else, you just pick up that phone.
it's routed straight to us. You understand? I should kill you right now.
back up. I'm leaving.
back up!
now, lock the door. You got it?
let's go.
lock it.
stay here. Don't move.
don't move.
OK.
Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, God.
did they say anything about the car? - Shh.
shh, baby.
poor baby. Let me see.
where the hell is our car? I need you to listen to me for a second.
I know you've had a hard time, with your father and everything that he did to you.
shut up. You don't know anything about me.
last year, your ex-girlfriend Amy was murdered. I know that.
Amy committed suicide.
no, she was killed, Ray.
Nah. Amy O. D.ed on PCP and alcohol.
they found heroin in her system, Ray.
Amy never did heroin.
exactly. Because somebody gave it to her.
why don't you ask Sydney about it?
Why? What does she-- what does she have to do with this?
ray, what's going on? Come on, man, think for a second.
sydney joined alcohol support right after you and Amy broke up.
she could see you still had feelings for Amy, so Sydney needed Amy out of the way.
you're out of line, pal.
then ask her. But I guarantee when you do, she's not gonna answer you. She's only gonna question you back, Ray.
what are you talking about?
sydney is the one who gave Amy that heroin.
ask her.
Hey, what-- what's wrong, Ray?
ask her. Get her to come clean.
did you give Amy heroin?
baby, what are you talking about? I love you.
listen-- there, you see that, Ray?
we call that structural deception. She doesn't want to answer your question.
she's only buying herself some time so she can think of something else to say to you.
that's not true. Ray, Sydney killed Amy.
and if you press her, she's probably gonna try and use sexual distraction to get you to change the subject.
don't you talk about my wife like that.
what is-- what is he saying?
sexual distraction, Ray. You gotta listen to me.
no, I'm done listening to you.
now, why don't you get us a car and some plane tickets, or I am gonna blow this girl's head off.
it's ok. It's ok, sis.
it's ok. Baby,
Ray... Why is he telling me that?
why is he saying this to me?
I don't know. I don't know.
you wouldn't do that to Amy, would you?
of course not, baby.
Hey, you know what we should do while we're waiting to get out of here?
we should make love right here in front of them.
Yeah, that would really freak them out, wouldn't it?
baby. Make love to me.
right here in front of them. Yeah.
I think we got through to him. This thing's gonna end.
he's gonna ask her again. He has to.
the kid's our only priority.
go back by the door.
I said go to the door!
baby, we can do it.
while everybody's watching us.
all right.
ray, that's so hot. It's so hot, Ray.
you know, the first time I saw you, I knew I had to have you.
you were the yin to my yang, Ray.
till death do us part, right?
Yeah. Yeah, right.
till death do us part.
Oh, baby. Mm...
what's happening in there?
ray's pacing.
that is not good.
what did you do to her?
Syd? Syd! Please, Syd.
wake up, Syd. Baby, wake up. Come on.
Syd, please wake up.
please.
please.
please, Syd.
Enough's enough, baby.
I see the girl.
Where's Sydney and Ray?
Morgan, go.
No!
william Glasser wrote "what happened in the past that was painful has a great deal to do with what we are today."
Sean, how are you? - Good.
so, I was gonna call you back.
I just got busy on a case.
I had to be in D. C. anyway.
Ian Boyle vanished from prison.
russia
Interpol can't find him.
what... What are you saying?
he's off the grid, Emily.
do you think he's headed here?
am I in danger?
we all are.
MIELS CITY, MONTANA
Yeah. It's conforming.
it's not conforming.
it's saying you own me.
that's an old-fashioned way of looking at things.
I don't want to be a possession.
marriage is about... Love and commitment, not possession, baby.
don't you want kids, Sunday dinners?
I like Sunday dinners.
tying the knot would guarantee me front-row seats to the movie of your life.
don't you want someone to...
change your diapers when you get old?
baby, if I ever need diapers, you just take me right out back and shoot me.
don't do it, son.
what are you saying?
marriage. Ruin your life.
why don't you ring these up.
you get married, the romance fizzles, your girl gets fat.
next thing you know you're lying on the couch wondering how come you don't have a bed.
marriage is overrated.
marriage is overrated.
how's it going, stranger?
Oh, I'm a little tired. I went Salsa dancing last night.
Oh, my God, like I need another reason to find you amazing.
this call for you from Sean McAllister came to my phone accidentally.
he sounded very hot and very important.
did he leave a message? No. But it's from Paris.
a Scottish guy calling from Paris.
know this, Emily-- even if he is ugly, Scottish guys are hot. It's the accent.
I'll keep that in mind.
so what's the skinny? Is he an ex?
international booty call? No. He's a friend.
Where's Seaver? She had to take a test at the Academy.
I know we've all seen the news. Mass murder in Miles City, Montana.
6 people shot and killed at a gas station.
robbery? - No apparent motive.
any security footage? No. No cameras, no witnesses, ballistics say we're looking at two shooters. Well, something at the station must have triggered them.
it doesn't look like they had much of a plan. And it may happen again.
spree killers often repeat themselves.
Billings, MONTANA.
we did it, baby.
we did it.
that was awesome.
I love you, Ray.
love you, too, Syd.
friedrich Nietzsche wrote, "what really raises one's indignation against suffering "is not suffering intrinsically, but the senselessness of suffering.
I'm sorry to reroute you to Billings, but last night, this went down. Have you released a statement to the press?
no, but it's already hit the air. Where's the car they dumped?
it's over there. Agents are searching it now.
one of the vics said the shooters were a male and a female.
how many people were murdered here?
8. If you add the Miles City killings, we're up to 14.
male-female teams are usually committed to pleasing each other, both mentally and physically. These guys are thrill killers.
they're aroused by the adrenaline rush. So they're not gonna stop until we catch them.
so this is just foreplay.
what's the news saying about us now?
they know we're male and female.
how did they figure that out?
I don't know. There was nothing girly about the way we killed those people.
where do you want to live, Ray?
I told you--Aruba. Right on the ocean.
I like the ocean.
so how do you want to spend the rest of our honeymoon?
exactly the same way that we spent the last 12 months.
till death do us part.
nothing's gonna happen to us, Syd.
I mean, I've seen dead bodies before, but this is insane.
they're like Bonnie and Clyde.
they smashed one guy's vertebrae so bad, it looked like a derailed train.
extreme brutality to this degree is what's known as an obliteration attack.
the unsub wants to completely erase these victims from existence.
both of the vics were shot at point blank range.
what made those? That was a crowbar.
Whew! Baby!
ray, I'm hungry.
the unsubs are becoming more and more confident, which means their weapons are becoming more and more personal.
the excitement of the brutality allows them to overcome their human inhibitions.
why is this one covered?
it's the store clerk. Guy got it pretty bad.
in medieval times, it would just be another Monday.
he was sodomized with a tire iron.
that kind of overkill suggests he was the root of their aggression.
maybe they're zeroing in on what's really pissing them off.
they took the store owner in the back.
they got the schoolteacher over here.
the kid over here thought he was safe.
why chain them in?
they thrive on sadistic power.
there's rice all over the floor.
bullet probably hit a box.
I take it this is the food aisle.
I don't see rice for sale anywhere on these shelves.
who comes to a gas station throwing rice? Ok, I checked surrounding areas.
72 people applied for marriage licenses in Montana in the last 3 days.
any of them have records? 31 do, the rest are clean.
all right. Send over all the names of the suspects with their ages, Garcia.
lover, they're all ready sent. Check your phones.
so you think they're newlyweds? Well, there was rice all over the crime scene, and a bunch of alcohol was missing from the store. So they're on their honeymoon.
what did you find out from the M. E?
overkill on the store clerk and sodomy--object penetration.
Garcia, last 30 days, check any store clerks killed in the states east of Montana.
Wow. Uh, there was a savagely beaten store clerk outside Jamestown at the beginning of the month, and then another one 2 days later in Bowman, North Dakota.
and that's probably where they started.
Thanks, Garcia.
Helena, MONTANA
Hey, there.
are you drinking all alone tonight, honey?
my company's a little busy.
my name's Ray.
Hi, Ray. - Hi, Ray.
I just got married.
and I'm an alcoholic.
Congratulations. - Congratulations.
I'm just passing through town and I wanted to stop and share because I partied last night.
what do you think made you drink?
come on. I was celebrating with my lady.
that's a big rock you got on your finger there.
I like things big.
I bet you do.
well, I've been drinking my whole life.
I started when I was 8.
my father was an alcoholic.
it tastes like...
grape kool-aid.
Oh, I like kool-aid.
whiskey and bourbon...
were his choice.
after he got his glass, he's come and he'd tuck me in.
first, he'd ask me about my day.
then he'd, uh, he'd move his hands up my leg.
told me everything was gonna be ok.
it was never ok.
20 bucks...
I'll let you have a taste.
Oh, you got a deal.
I'd just bury my head into my pillow and wait until it was over.
and when he was done,
I'd just lie there quietly.
it's nice of you to share with us, Ray.
what step have you gotten to?
7
the same age I was when he did that to me.
well, it's time for you to do 8 and 9.
have you admitted your shortcomings?
this wasn't my fault.
but you've let this one incident dictate your whole life.
I was a kid.
I know, Ray.
but until you let this go, you will always be a victim to the bottle.
to the bottle, to the bottle, to the bottle...
screw you and your bottle.
what happened to him?
he got fresh with me.
this is 100 miles west of the last gas station.
we anticipated them hitting this area, but not here.
maybe this guy tried to have sex with one of our unsubs while the other one was inside. Cheating on your honeymoon.
someone's got a twisted sense of commitment.
so they steal the liquor from the gas station, they go on a binge, and then they come to a meeting?
what if the unsubs met at a meeting?
they hear each other's stories and develop a bond because of their similar backgrounds.
that makes sense. People typically drink to excess because they're unhappy with themselves or their past.
from the looks of it, at least one of the unsubs shot from up front.
run!
well, if the meeting started at 8: 00, and this happened at 8: 45, they were probably in the sharing portion of the meeting.
so maybe they didn't come in here to kill.
you know, what if they really are struggling with sobriety?
if they're really working the program, they could be working on the hardest steps.
which are? 7, 8,and 9.
acknowledge your shortcomings, accept responsibility, and make amends.
the trouble is, these unsubs already broke one of the most important steps.
what's that? The thirteenth step.
members aren't supposed to enter relationships with each other while trying to get sober.
what are you thinking about?
we need to go to the next step.
all this killing and drinking is fun, but it doesn't change the fact that, you know, my father used to rape me, or what your daddy did to you, you know.
what are you saying, Syd?
if you want to find closure, you gotta go directly to the source.
we do 8 and 9?
why not?
we're looking for a young couple from North Dakota, late teens to mid-20s. We believe they may have recently been married.
we're seeing that alcohol plays a significant role in these crimes.
it's allowing them to kill freely and recklessly.
our unsubs are killing surrogates who represent those responsible for deep-seated wounds. Now, these two most likely met at alcohol support.
and they get a sexual charge out of the kill.
the change from gas station to alcohol support meetings suggests one of them might have a slight moral compass that led them to get help.
ultimately, we believe one of the pair is a sociopath, while the other is a psychopath.
what's really the difference?
they're similar pathologies, but a sociopath is less likely to participate in criminal activity and can be lured by a dominant, while a psychopath is a consummate leader and likely to engage and destroy anyone in their way.
the most recent attack was 12 hours ago, which means they're most likely heading west of Helena and towards Idaho. All surrounding areas should be on alert.
this is it?
this is it. This is it. This is your house.
say hi to me, baby.
Hi, baby.
you look good.
this is Ray's house.
Hey, baby. Kiss me.
you look good, baby.
Mmm. Cute butt.
Yeah, can I help you?
say cheese.
Hi, daddy.
these alcohol support groups are based on anonymity.
there'll be no record of who attended the meeting.
Garcia, our unsubs attended an alcohol support meeting last night, but they're not from the area.
can you trace who accessed their website yesterday?
3 people went to that website, one on a mobile, 2 on DSL.
cross-check that with a list of anyone married in Montana in the last 2 days.
no, no, I'm coming up empty.
see if anyone on the list who accessed the site is from North Dakota.
bingo, baby. Ray Donovan of Devil's Lake.
ironic. - What's his story?
he is 27. He's been in and out of foster care since he was 10.
he looks like kind of a lush and a bit of a meanie.
he's had 2 DUIs in the last 2 years.
he was slapped with a restraining order by an ex-girlfriend.
sounds like our boy. What's her name? She might be his partner.
no, she's not. Her name's Amy Wichowsky.
she died a year ago of an overdose from a mix of alcohol and heroin.
Garcia, get us the address of the foster home. Somebody there might know something.
sure. Give me a sec.
I talked to all 4 of Ray's foster families.
they say he was removed from his parents' home because of drugs and abuse.
Garcia. - Yes?
can we confirm that with the biological family?
OK. I'm gonna patch you through.
I want you to take the ninth step.
take the ninth step? Why?
I didn't do anything.
I was put into foster care because of you, you bastard.
you were put in foster care because of our drug problem.
ray, no one molested you.
put the gun down, Ray.
shut up! Take the ninth step or I'm gonna shoot you, dad.
I didn't do it.
I didn't touch you.
ray, you're my own flesh and blood.
I never touched you. Don't you lie!
I said I'll take care of it.
I swear it.
take the ninth step.
I ain't taking no step.
take it.
take it.
I ain't gonna ask you again.
No!
why did you do that, Syd?
cause you wouldn't.
I would have. Look what you did.
come on, Ray.
look what you did, Syd! - Come on, Ray.
look what you did! It wasn't for you to do!
this was mine, Syd!
all right, so Ray must have been sitting right here, playing Russian roulette with his dad.
Mr. Donovan was shot from across the room.
ray couldn't have done it sitting there.
maybe he got mad, went over by the door, shot him from there.
we NEED TO TALK.
you all right?
Yeah. It's nothing. Uh, what if Ray didn't do it at all?
what if the girl pulled the trigger?
well, why would Ray let her do that? He was the one with the grudge.
ray kept asking Paul to take the ninth step.
take the ninth step.
it sounds like they're making amends, but they're twisting it, trying to force people who have wronged them to make amends to them.
Mrs. Donovan, did you hear the name of the girl that Ray's with?
he kept calling her Syd.
Syd, I think.
maybe she's the one calling the shots.
she's the psychopath.
well, if she did do it without his consent, they're going to be at odds.
the first marital fight is supposed to be the worst.
well, it just might be the wedge that we need.
Ray... Please don't be mad.
baby. Baby! I need a minute.
let me talk to you. I'm going to tell you I'm sorry.
he touched me, not you.
baby, just take it out on me.
come on. Just take your frustrations out on me. Come on.
come on, baby. Hit me. Hit me.
stop it, Syd! Hit me.
stop it, Syd!
Yeah. Yeah.
do it. Do it.
when I say I'm gonna handle something, I will handle it.
I understand, baby. I am the man in this relationship.
I just want to make you feel better, baby.
Syd, a man takes care of things.
you understand me? Huh?
I understand. I understand.
I understand.
I'm serious, Syd.
I am, too. Mmm.
Yeah. Yeah.
OK, so, no Ray Donovan filed for a marriage certificate.
however, I looked at that list again, and there's a Sydney Manning of Washington State who filed for a marriage certificate 2 days ago in Montana.
washington State? We profiled North Dakota.
Yes, she's lived in North Dakota for the last 4 years, and it gets better, or worse, rather. It turns out that Sydney was sentenced to mandatory rehab after serving time for a hit and run during which she was under the influence of alcohol and heroin.
Oh, so she didn't volunteer for alcohol support.
no, she was placed there as part of her parole. Alcohol and heroin.
isn't that the same combo that Ray's ex O. D.ed on?
Yes, it is, my friend.
so both Syd and the ex have the same vice.
Garcia, check to see if there's an juvie records of the ex we can access.
Amy was pulled out of High School so she could go to rehab for alcohol dependency. But no mention of the heroin?
what are you thinking?
psychopaths will destroy anything in their path. What if Amy was in Sydney's way?
Garcia, where is Sydney Manning's biological family?
Spokane, Washington. And why was she pulled out of her home?
her father was molesting her.
so Ray and Syd did meet after sharing similar backgrounds in alcohol support.
and if they're sticking to the pattern of making amends, Sydney's father's next on the list.
Reid, you stay at the command center in case they double back.
the rest of us are gonna go to Spokane.
Spokane, WASHINGTON
this is about to get crazy.
can I help you?
Hey, daddy.
how you been?
what are you doing here, Sydney?
have you heard of the ninth step?
what?
I got no idea what you're talking about.
making amends.
why don't you just put the gun away.
see, I don't want to put the gun away.
I want you...
to touch me.
what are you talking about?
I want you to touch me.
you used to like it.
Syd, put your skirt down.
I ain't puttin' down Jack.
what's the matter, daddy?
you don't like the way I look?
you're out of control.
no, no...
you were out of control.
listen...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I hurt you.
I've changed.
I've found God.
God?
where was he every time you'd take me to that back room, huh?
I don't know.
not here. I don't know.
not here.
every time I'd hear that door chime, somebody's gonna come save me?
it never happened.
God was nowhere near this place.
please.
what do you want me to do?
there's nothing you can do, you sorry piece of crap!
Yeah, baby.
daddy? Daddy!
what are you doing to my dad?
may I help you? Mrs. Manning, we're with the FBI.
is your husband home? He's at work. What is this about?
your daughter Sydney-- we think she's planning on hurting him.
Sydney? That's Gary's kid.
he hasn't seen her in years.
can you tell us your husband's work address, please?
uh, 785 Halbrook Street, off Kirkland Road.
he owns a gas station.
thank you.
please, Sydney, don't do this. - Daddy!
I never hurt her I never hurt her! Of course you didn't!
he didn't, I swear. Daddy!
Hey. Hey. Daddies don't do this to their daughters.
Hey, it's ok. It's ok. We're gonna get you out of here.
Hey. Hey, honey.
you'll change your mind.
I did.
I want my daddy! My daddy!
Prentiss, get down! It's them! Get back!
ray, they got me. They got me, baby.
you'll be ok. It's not that bad, baby.
she needs a doctor. I know what she needs.
get me some whiskey. There's no alcohol in here.
you're kidding me. My dad doesn't drink. He says it's against the Bible.
you don't have to protect him anymore. He's gone.
get her a water.
get her some water!
what do you want?
Mr. Donovan, how you doing in there?
how do you think I'm doing? You shot my girl.
no, it was one of my agents. He didn't have a choice.
he had a choice. He could've shot me. Now put him on the phone.
I can't do that. Yes, you can. Put him on the phone.
he needs to fix this crap.
Hello, Ray. You know, if you come out, we can get Sydney to the hospital. She doesn't need a hospital.
she's strong. Don't be stupid.
you don't be stupid.
now get your men out of here so we can continue on as planned.
we can't do that, Ray, and you know it. You got a little girl inside.
and God only knows what happened to Sydney's father.
justice happened to her father.
so he's dead? Damn right he's dead, and his kid's gonna be, too, if you don't get me a car to take us to Aruba.
all right. Let me see what I can do about that.
is there anything else you need in the meantime?
some gauze and some booze.
and none of them cheap kind, either.
it has now been 2 hours since Ray Donovan and Sydney Manning locked themselves inside this Spokane gas station.
two hostages are thought to be inside, the owner of the station and his 10-year-old daughter.
what do they want?
liquor and tickets to Aruba. They're delusional.
you're not negotiating with them? No, but we're gonna let them think we are.
does she look like me?
I think she does.
I don't know, Syd.
don't be scared. We're not gonna hurt you.
Syd... What grade are you in?
shh, Syd. You need to preserve your energy.
fourth grade.
I liked the fourth grade.
stop talking to her.
relax, Ray, we're having a family reunion in aisle 3.
be supportive.
move back!
move back or I kill this girl.
back off! Back off!
I will shoot this kid!
back off!
back!
kid, unlock that door. You got it?
put your hand on the lock. Just unlock it.
got it? - Yes.
OK. Yes.
ray? Take it easy, man.
take it easy. - You take it easy.
put it down!
all right. Put it down. We got you the stuff you asked for.
we're working on the rest.
great.
if you need anything else, you just pick up that phone.
it's routed straight to us. You understand? I should kill you right now.
back up. I'm leaving.
back up!
now, lock the door. You got it?
let's go.
lock it.
stay here. Don't move.
don't move.
OK.
Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, God.
did they say anything about the car? - Shh.
shh, baby.
poor baby. Let me see.
where the hell is our car? I need you to listen to me for a second.
I know you've had a hard time, with your father and everything that he did to you.
shut up. You don't know anything about me.
last year, your ex-girlfriend Amy was murdered. I know that.
Amy committed suicide.
no, she was killed, Ray.
Nah. Amy O. D.ed on PCP and alcohol.
they found heroin in her system, Ray.
Amy never did heroin.
exactly. Because somebody gave it to her.
why don't you ask Sydney about it?
Why? What does she-- what does she have to do with this?
ray, what's going on? Come on, man, think for a second.
sydney joined alcohol support right after you and Amy broke up.
she could see you still had feelings for Amy, so Sydney needed Amy out of the way.
you're out of line, pal.
then ask her. But I guarantee when you do, she's not gonna answer you. She's only gonna question you back, Ray.
what are you talking about?
sydney is the one who gave Amy that heroin.
ask her.
Hey, what-- what's wrong, Ray?
ask her. Get her to come clean.
did you give Amy heroin?
baby, what are you talking about? I love you.
listen-- there, you see that, Ray?
we call that structural deception. She doesn't want to answer your question.
she's only buying herself some time so she can think of something else to say to you.
that's not true. Ray, Sydney killed Amy.
and if you press her, she's probably gonna try and use sexual distraction to get you to change the subject.
don't you talk about my wife like that.
what is-- what is he saying?
sexual distraction, Ray. You gotta listen to me.
no, I'm done listening to you.
now, why don't you get us a car and some plane tickets, or I am gonna blow this girl's head off.
it's ok. It's ok, sis.
it's ok. Baby,
Ray... Why is he telling me that?
why is he saying this to me?
I don't know. I don't know.
you wouldn't do that to Amy, would you?
of course not, baby.
Hey, you know what we should do while we're waiting to get out of here?
we should make love right here in front of them.
Yeah, that would really freak them out, wouldn't it?
baby. Make love to me.
right here in front of them. Yeah.
I think we got through to him. This thing's gonna end.
he's gonna ask her again. He has to.
the kid's our only priority.
go back by the door.
I said go to the door!
baby, we can do it.
while everybody's watching us.
all right.
ray, that's so hot. It's so hot, Ray.
you know, the first time I saw you, I knew I had to have you.
you were the yin to my yang, Ray.
till death do us part, right?
Yeah. Yeah, right.
till death do us part.
Oh, baby. Mm...
what's happening in there?
ray's pacing.
that is not good.
what did you do to her?
Syd? Syd! Please, Syd.
wake up, Syd. Baby, wake up. Come on.
Syd, please wake up.
please.
please.
please, Syd.
Enough's enough, baby.
I see the girl.
Where's Sydney and Ray?
Morgan, go.
No!
william Glasser wrote "what happened in the past "that was painful has a great deal to do with what we are today.
Sean, how are you? - Good.
so, I was gonna call you back.
I just got busy on a case.
I had to be in D. C. anyway.
Ian Boyle vanished from prison.
russia
Interpol can't find him.
what... What are you saying?
he's off the grid, Emily.
do you think he's headed here?
am I in danger?
we all are.
ray. - It's conforming.
it's not conforming.
it's saying you own me.
that's an old-fashioned way of looking at things.
I don't want to be a possession.
marriage is about... Love and commitment, not possession, baby.
don't you want kids, Sunday dinners?
I like Sunday dinners.
tying the knot would guarantee me front-row seats to the movie of your life.
don't you want someone to...
change your diapers when you get old?
baby, if I ever need diapers, you just take me right out back and shoot me.
don't do it, son.
what are you saying?
marriage.
ruin your life.
why don't you ring these up?
you get married, the romance fizzles, your girl gets fat.
next thing you know you're lying on the couch wondering how come you don't have a bed.
marriage is overrated.
marriage is overrated.
how's it going, stranger?
Oh, I'm a little tired. I went Salsa dancing last night.
Oh, my God, like I need another reason to find you amazing.
this call for you from Sean McAllister came to my phone accidentally.
he sounded very hot and very important.
did he leave a message? - No. But it's from Paris.
a Scottish guy calling from Paris.
know this, Emily-- even if he is ugly, Scottish guys are hot. It's the accent.
I'll keep that in mind. - So what's the skinny? Is he an ex?
international booty call?
no. He's a friend.
Where's Seaver? - She had to take a test at the Academy.
I know we've all seen the news.
mass murder in Miles City, Montana.
6 people shot and killed at a gas station.
robbery? - No apparent motive.
any security footage?
no. No cameras, no witnesses, ballistics say we're looking at two shooters.
well, something at the station must have triggered them.
it doesn't look like they had much of a plan.
and it may happen again. Spree killers often repeat themselves.
we did it, baby.
we did it.
that was awesome.
I love you, Ray.
love you, too, Syd.
friedrich Nietzsche wrote, "what really raises one's indignation against suffering is not suffering intrinsically, but the senselessness of suffering."
I'm sorry to reroute you to Billings, but last night, this went down.
have you released a statement to the press?
no, but it's already hit the air.
Where's the car they dumped?
it's over there. Agents are searching it now.
one of the vics said the shooters were a male and a female.
how many people were murdered here?
8. If you add the Miles City killings, we're up to 14.
male-female teams are usually committed to pleasing each other, both mentally and physically.
these guys are thrill killers. They're aroused by the adrenaline rush.
so they're not gonna stop until we catch them.
so this is just foreplay.
Ray: What's the news saying about us now?
they know we're male and female.
how did they figure that out?
I don't know.
there was nothing girly about the way we killed those people.
where do you want to live, Ray?
I told you--Aruba.
right on the ocean.
I like the ocean.
so how do you want to spend the rest of our honeymoon?
exactly the same way that we spent the last 12 months.
till death do us part.
nothing's gonna happen to us, Syd.
I mean, I've seen dead bodies before, but this is insane.
they're like Bonnie and Clyde.
they smashed one guy's vertebrae so bad, it looked like a derailed train.
extreme brutality to this degree is what's known as an obliteration attack.
the unsub wants to completely erase these victims from existence.
both of the vics were shot at point blank range.
what made those?
that was a crowbar.
baby!
ray, I'm hungry.
the unsubs are becoming more and more confident, which means their weapons are becoming more and more personal.
the excitement of the brutality allows them to overcome their human inhibitions.
why is this one covered?
it's the store clerk. Guy got it pretty bad.
in medieval times, it would just be another Monday.
he was sodomized with a tire iron.
that kind of overkill suggests he was the root of their aggression.
maybe they're zeroing in on what's really pissing them off.
they took the store owner in the back.
they got the schoolteacher over here.
the kid over here thought he was safe.
why chain them in?
they thrive on sadistic power.
there's rice all over the floor.
bullet probably hit a box.
I take it this is the food aisle.
I don't see rice for sale anywhere on these shelves.
who comes to a gas station throwing rice?
OK, I checked surrounding areas.
72 people applied for marriage licenses in Montana in the last 3 days.
any of them have records?
31 do, the rest are clean.
all right. Send over all the names of the suspects with their ages, Garcia.
lover, they're all ready sent. Check your phones.
so you think they're newlyweds?
well, there was rice all over the crime scene, and a bunch of alcohol was missing from the store.
so they're on their honeymoon.
what did you find out from the M. E?
overkill on the store clerk and sodomy--object penetration.
Garcia, last 30 days, check any store clerks killed in the states east of Montana.
uh, there was a savagely beaten store clerk outside Jamestown at the beginning of the month, and then another one 2 days later in Bowman, North Dakota.
and that's probably where they started.
Thanks, Garcia.
Hey, there.
are you drinking all alone tonight, honey?
my company's a little busy.
my name's Ray.
Hi, Ray. - Hi, Ray.
I just got married.
and I'm an alcoholic.
Congratulations. - Congratulations.
I'm just passing through town and I wanted to stop and share because I partied last night.
what do you think made you drink?
come on.
I was celebrating with my lady.
that's a big rock you got on your finger there.
I like things big.
I bet you do.
well, I've been drinking my whole life.
I started when I was 8.
my father was an alcoholic.
it tastes like...
grape kool-aid.
Oh, I like kool-aid.
whiskey and bourbon... Were his choice.
after he got his glass, he's come and he'd tuck me in.
first, he'd ask me about my day.
then he'd, uh, he'd move his hands up my leg.
told me everything was gonna be ok.
it was never ok.
20 bucks... I'll let you have a taste.
Oh, you got a deal.
I'd just bury my head into my pillow and wait until it was over.
and when he was done, I'd just lie there quietly.
it's nice of you to share with us, Ray.
what step have you gotten to?
7. The same age I was when he did that to me.
well, it's time for you to do 8 and 9.
have you admitted your shortcomings?
this wasn't my fault.
but you've let this one incident dictate your whole life.
I was a kid. - I know, Ray.
but until you let this go, you will always be a victim to the bottle.
to the bottle, to the bottle, to the bottle...
screw you and your bottle.
what happened to him?
he got fresh with me.
this is 100 miles west of the last gas station.
we anticipated them hitting this area, but not here.
maybe this guy tried to have sex with one of our unsubs while the other one was inside.
cheating on your honeymoon.
someone's got a twisted sense of commitment.
so they steal the liquor from the gas station, they go on a binge, and then they come to a meeting?
what if the unsubs met at a meeting?
they hear each other's stories and develop a bond because of their similar backgrounds.
that makes sense.
people typically drink to excess because they're unhappy with themselves or their past.
from the looks of it, at least one of the unsubs shot from up front.
well, if the meeting started at 8: 00, and this happened at 8: 45, they were probably in the sharing portion of the meeting.
so maybe they didn't come in here to kill.
you know, what if they really are struggling with sobriety?
if they're really working the program, they could be working on the hardest steps.
which are?
7, 8,and 9. Acknowledge your shortcomings, accept responsibility, and make amends.
the trouble is, these unsubs already broke one of the most important steps.
what's that? - The thirteenth step.
members aren't supposed to enter relationships with each other while trying to get sober.
what are you thinking about?
we need to go to the next step.
all this killing and drinking is fun, but it doesn't change the fact that, you know, my father used to rape me, or what your daddy did to you, you know.
what are you saying, Syd?
if you want to find closure, you gotta go directly to the source.
we do 8 and 9?
why not?
we're looking for a young couple from North Dakota, late teens to mid-20s.
we believe they may have recently been married.
we're seeing that alcohol plays a significant role in these crimes.
it's allowing them to kill freely and recklessly.
our unsubs are killing surrogates who represent those responsible for deep-seated wounds.
now, these two most likely met at alcohol support.
and they get a sexual charge out of the kill.
the change from gas station to alcohol support meetings suggests one of them might have a slight moral compass that led them to get help.
ultimately, we believe one of the pair is a sociopath, while the other is a psychopath.
what's really the difference?
they're similar pathologies, but a sociopath is less likely to participate in criminal activity and can be lured by a dominant, while a psychopath is a consummate leader and likely to engage and destroy anyone in their way.
the most recent attack was 12 hours ago, which means they're most likely heading west of Helena and towards Idaho.
all surrounding areas should be on alert.
Syd: This is it?
this is it. - This is it.
this is your house.
say hi to me, baby.
Hi, baby. - You look good.
this is Ray's house.
Hey, baby. Kiss me.
you look good, baby.
cute butt.
Yeah, can I help you?
say cheese.
Hi, daddy.
these alcohol support groups are based on anonymity.
there'll be no record of who attended the meeting.
Garcia, our unsubs attended an alcohol support meeting last night, but they're not from the area.
can you trace who accessed their website yesterday?
3 people went to that website, one on a mobile, 2 on DSL.
cross-check that with a list of anyone married in Montana in the last 2 days.
no, no, I'm coming up empty.
see if anyone on the list who accessed the site is from North Dakota.
bingo, baby. Ray Donovan of Devil's Lake.
ironic. - What's his story?
he is 27.
he's been in and out of foster care since he was 10.
he looks like kind of a lush and a bit of a meanie.
he's had 2 DUIs in the last 2 years.
he was slapped with a restraining order by an ex-girlfriend.
sounds like our boy.
what's her name? She might be his partner.
no, she's not. Her name's Amy Wichowsky.
she died a year ago of an overdose from a mix of alcohol and heroin.
Garcia, get us the address of the foster home.
somebody there might know something.
sure. Give me a sec.
I talked to all 4 of Ray's foster families.
they say he was removed from his parents' home because of drugs and abuse.
Garcia. - Yes?
can we confirm that with the biological family?
OK. I'm gonna patch you through.
I want you to take the ninth step.
take the ninth step? Why?
I didn't do anything.
I was put into foster care because of you, you bastard.
you were put in foster care because of our drug problem.
ray, no one molested you.
put the gun down, Ray.
shut up!
take the ninth step or I'm gonna shoot you, dad.
I didn't do it. I didn't touch you.
ray, you're my own flesh and blood.
I never touched you.
don't you lie! - I said I'll take care of it.
I swear it.
take the ninth step.
I ain't taking no step.
take it. Take it.
I ain't gonna ask you again.
No!
why did you do that, Syd?
cause you wouldn't.
I would have.
look what you did.
come on, Ray.
look what you did, Syd! - Come on, Ray.
look what you did!
it wasn't for you to do!
this was mine, Syd!
all right, so Ray must have been sitting right here, playing Russian roulette with his dad.
Mr. Donovan was shot from across the room.
ray couldn't have done it sitting there.
maybe he got mad, went over by the door, shot him from there.
you all right?
Yeah. It's nothing.
uh, what if Ray didn't do it at all?
what if the girl pulled the trigger?
well, why would Ray let her do that? He was the one with the grudge.
ray kept asking Paul to take the ninth step.
take the ninth step.
it sounds like they're making amends, but they're twisting it, trying to force people who have wronged them to make amends to them.
Mrs. Donovan, did you hear the name of the girl that Ray's with?
he kept calling her Syd.
Syd, I think.
maybe she's the one calling the shots.
she's the psychopath.
well, if she did do it without his consent, they're going to be at odds.
the first marital fight is supposed to be the worst.
well, it just might be the wedge that we need.
Ray... Please don't be mad.
baby. Baby! - I need a minute.
let me talk to you. I'm going to tell you I'm sorry. Huh?
he touched me, not you.
baby, just take it out on me. Come on. Just take your frustrations out on me.
come on. Come on, baby.
hit me. Hit me. Hit me. - Stop it, Syd! Stop it, Syd!
Yeah. Yeah. Do it. Do it.
when I say I'm gonna handle something, I will handle it.
I understand, baby. - I am the man in this relationship.
I just want to make you feel better, baby.
Syd, a man takes care of things.
you understand me? Huh?
I understand. I understand. I understand.
I'm serious, Syd. - I am, too.
Yeah. Yeah.
OK, so, no Ray Donovan filed for a marriage certificate.
however, I looked at that list again, and there's a Sydney Manning of Washington State who filed for a marriage certificate 2 days ago in Montana.
washington State? We profiled North Dakota.
Yes, she's lived in North Dakota for the last 4 years, and it gets better, or worse, rather.
it turns out that Sydney was sentenced to mandatory rehab after serving time for a hit and run during which she was under the influence of alcohol and heroin.
Oh, so she didn't volunteer for alcohol support.
no, she was placed there as part of her parole.
alcohol and heroin. Isn't that the same combo that Ray's ex O. D.ed on?
Yes, it is, my friend.
so both Syd and the ex have the same vice.
Garcia, check to see if there's an juvie records of the ex we can access.
Amy was pulled out of High School so she could go to rehab for alcohol dependency.
but no mention of the heroin?
what are you thinking?
psychopaths will destroy anything in their path.
what if Amy was in Sydney's way?
Garcia, where is Sydney Manning's biological family?
Spokane, Washington.
and why was she pulled out of her home?
her father was molesting her.
so Ray and Syd did meet after sharing similar backgrounds in alcohol support.
and if they're sticking to the pattern of making amends, Sydney's father's next on the list.
Reid, you stay at the command center in case they double back.
the rest of us are gonna go to Spokane.
this is about to get crazy.
can I help you?
Hey, daddy.
how you been?
what are you doing here, Sydney?
have you heard of the ninth step?
what?
I got no idea what you're talking about.
making amends.
why don't you just put the gun away.
see, I don't want to put the gun away.
I want you...
to touch me.
what are you talking about?
I want you to touch me.
you used to like it.
Syd, put your skirt down.
I ain't puttin' down Jack.
Sydney-- what's the matter, daddy?
you don't like the way I look?
Sydney... You're out of control.
no, no... 
you were out of control.
listen... I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I hurt you.
I've changed. I've found God.
God?
where was he every time you'd take me to that back room, huh?
I don't know. - Not here.
I don't know. - Not here.
every time I'd hear that door chime, somebody's gonna come save me?
it never happened.
God was nowhere near this place.
please.
Sydney... What do you want me to do?
there's nothing you can do, you sorry piece of crap!
Yeah, baby.
daddy? Daddy!
what are you doing to my dad?
may I help you?
Mrs. Manning, we're with the FBI.
is your husband home?
he's at work. What is this about?
your daughter Sydney-- we think she's planning on hurting him.
Sydney? That's Gary's kid.
he hasn't seen her in years.
can you tell us your husband's work address, please?
uh, 785 Halbrook Street, off Kirkland Road.
he owns a gas station.
thank you.
please, Sydney, don't do this. - Daddy!
I never hurt her I never hurt her!
of course you didn't!
he didn't, I swear. Daddy!
daddies don't do this to their daughters.
Hey, it's ok. It's ok.
we're gonna get you out of here.
Hey, honey.
you'll change your mind.
I did.
I want my daddy! My daddy!
Prentiss, get down! It's them! Get back!
ray, they got me.
they got me, baby.
you'll be ok. It's not that bad, baby.
she needs a doctor.
I know what she needs.
get me some whiskey.
there's no alcohol in here.
you're kidding me.
my dad doesn't drink.
he says it's against the Bible.
you don't have to protect him anymore. He's gone.
get her a water.
get her some water!
what do you want?
Mr. Donovan, how you doing in there?
how do you think I'm doing? You shot my girl.
no, it was one of my agents. He didn't have a choice.
he didn't have a choice. He could've shot me. Now put him on the phone.
I can't do that.
Yes, you can. Put him on the phone.
he needs to fix this crap.
Hello, Ray.
you know, if you come out, we can get Sydney to the hospital.
she doesn't need a hospital.
she's strong.
don't be stupid.
you don't be stupid.
now get your men out of here so we can continue on as planned.
we can't do that, Ray, and you know it.
you got a little girl inside.
and God only knows what happened to Sydney's father.
justice happened to her father.
so he's dead?
damn right he's dead, and his kid's gonna be, too, if you don't get me a car to take us to Aruba.
all right.
let me see what I can do about that.
is there anything else you need in the meantime?
some gauze and some booze.
and none of them cheap kind, either.
it has now been 2 hours since Ray Donovan and Sydney Manning locked themselves inside this Spokane gas station.
two hostages are thought to be inside, the owner of the station and his 10-year-old daughter.
what do they want?
liquor and tickets to Aruba.
they're delusional.
you're not negotiating with them?
no, but we're gonna let them think we are.
does she look like me?
I think she does.
I don't know, Syd.
don't be scared.
we're not gonna hurt you.
what grade are you in?
shh, Syd. You need to preserve your energy.
fourth grade.
I liked the fourth grade.
stop talking to her.
relax, Ray, we're having a family reunion in aisle 3.
be supportive.
move back!
move back or I kill this girl.
back off! Back off!
I will shoot this kid! Back off!
back
kid, unlock that door. You got it?
put your hand on the lock.
just unlock it.
got it? - Yes.
OK. Yes.
ray? Take it easy, man.
take it easy. - You take it easy.
put it down! - All right.
put it down.
we got you the stuff you asked for. We're working on the rest.
great.
if you need anything else, you just pick up that phone.
it's routed straight to us. You understand?
I should kill you right now.
back up. - I'm leaving.
back up!
now, lock the door. You got it?
let's go.
lock it.
stay here. Don't move. Don't move.
OK.
Oh, God.
did they say anything about the car?
shh, baby. Poor baby. Let me see.
yeah?
where the hell is our car?
I need you to listen to me for a second.
I know you've had a hard time, with your father and everything that he did to you.
shut up. You don't know anything about me.
last year, your ex-girlfriend Amy was murdered. I know that.
Amy committed suicide.
no, she was killed, Ray.
Nah.
Amy O. D.ed on PCP and alcohol.
they found heroin in her system, Ray.
Amy never did heroin.
exactly. Because somebody gave it to her.
why don't you ask Sydney about it?
Why? What does she-- what does she have to do with this?
ray, what's going on?
come on, man, think for a second.
sydney joined alcohol support right after you and Amy broke up.
she could see you still had feelings for Amy, so Sydney needed Amy out of the way.
you're out of line, pal.
then ask her. But I guarantee when you do, she's not gonna answer you.
she's only gonna question you back, Ray.
what are you talking about?
sydney is the one who gave Amy that heroin.
ask her.
Hey, what-- what's wrong, Ray?
ask her. Get her to come clean.
did you give Amy heroin?
baby, what are you talking about? I love you.
listen-- there, you see that, Ray?
we call that structural deception.
she doesn't want to answer your question.
she's only buying herself some time so she can think of something else to say to you.
that's not true.
ray, Sydney killed Amy.
and if you press her, she's probably gonna try and use sexual distraction to get you to change the subject.
don't you talk about my wife like that.
what is-- what is he saying?
sexual distraction, Ray. You gotta listen to me.
no, I'm done listening to you.
now, why don't you get us a car and some plane tickets, or I am gonna blow this girl's head off.
it's ok. It's ok, sis. It's ok.
baby, Ray... - Why is he telling me that?
why is he saying this to me? - I don't know. I don't know.
you wouldn't do that to Amy, would you?
of course not, baby.
Hey, you know what we should do while we're waiting to get out of here?
we should make love right here in front of them.
Yeah, that would really freak them out, wouldn't it?
yeah?
baby. Make love to me.
right here in front of them.
Yeah.
I think we got through to him.
this thing's gonna end.
he's gonna ask her again.
he has to.
the kid's our only priority.
go back by the door.
I said go to the door!
baby, we can do it.
while everybody's watching us.
all right.
ray, that's so hot. It's so hot, Ray.
you know, the first time I saw you, I knew I had to have you.
you were the yin to my yang, Ray.
till death do us part, right?
Yeah. Yeah, right.
till death do us part.
Oh, baby.
what's happening in there?
ray's pacing.
that is not good.
what did you do to her?
Syd! Please, Syd.
wake up, Syd. Baby, wake up. Come on. Syd, please wake up.
please. Please.
please, Syd.
Enough's enough, baby.
I see the girl.
Where's Sydney and Ray?
Morgan, go.
No! Sid!
william Glasser wrote "what happened in the past that was painful has a great deal to do with what we are today."
Sean, how are you? - Good.
so, I was gonna call you back.
I just got busy on a case.
I had to be in D. C. anyway.
Ian Boyle vanished from prison.
Interpol can't find him.
what... What are you saying?
he's off the grid, Emily.
do you think he's headed here?
am I in danger?
we all are.
Emily this calls for you from a Sean McAllister came to my phone accidentally.
it sounded very important.
Sean. I was gonna call you back.
I just--I got busy on a case.
Ian Doyle vanished from prison.
Interpol can't find him.
am I in danger?
we all are.
Sean thinks we're all in danger.
but I was the only one who had any personal connection to him.
as far as Doyle is concerned, Lauren Reynolds died in a car accident.
you died and we're all good.
I want to hear you say it.
Lauren Reynolds is dead. Bye.
who's Lauren Reynolds?
- They got her.
drop the phone. Get on the ground, now.
he's gone. Jeremy's dead.
how long have we been talking?
you've gotta get out of there.
Oh, God.
it's Doyle, isn't it?
toss that cell phone and get home safely.
Prentiss, what's going on with you?
I've been watching you the last couple of days and something is obviously bothering you.
Derek, because I like you, I'm going to ask you not to do this.
I was beginning to think you weren't coming.
after what happened to Jeremy, I was afraid.
tsia, I'm sorry you can't be at his funeral.
it's today, isn't it?
well, that's the problem with marrying a member from your own team.
one of you is a target, so is the other. I get it.
Hello, darling.
all right, let's make this quick. I took a late lunch.
how many times do I have to tell you?
I'm not quick about anything.
I don't know.
what about that time I blew my cover in Prague?
you took out that sentry before I could even draw my weapon.
you saved my ass, Clyde.
I'm surprised you remember the little people from your Interpol days now that you're a posh FBI profiler.
what's being done to locate Doyle?
only every agency in the Northern hemisphere is looking for him.
what are we doing to find him?
Tsia: My contact at DCRI tracked one of Doyle's aliases leaving France the day after Jeremy's murder.
he took a commercial flight to Beijing, then doubled back on a train bound for Berlin.
but when GSG 9 intercepted it, he was already gone.
he sent me flowers, so I think it's safe to assume he's coming here.
why is he doing this?
why do you think? We put him away.
duty calls?
I know what you're thinking.
absolutely not.
your team isn't under oath.
they don't have clearance.
they could help.
how?
we don't even know where Doyle is.
involving them at this point would be premature.
and reckless. Leave it to Tsia and I. You go be with your team.
even in hiding Doyle can't resist extravagance. Track the money.
I will find him, darling.
trust me. - I don't trust anyone anymore.
traffic. I'm sorry. - Let's get started.
OK. 10-year-old Sammy Sparks of Lafayette Parish, Louisiana, showed up at his elementary school this morning covered in blood.
when police got to his house, they found that his parents,
Charlie and Alison Sparks, were missing.
well, forensics indicate that at least one of them was injured, and by the looks of it, it was pretty severely.
has there been a ransom demand?
there's been no communication whatsoever.
then why call in the BAU?
new Orleans is hoping we can interview Sammy.
no one's talked to the witness yet?
I don't understand.
if Sammy was covered with blood, there's a good chance he could identify the unsub.
Sammy's autistic.
getting him to tell us what happened isn't gonna be easy.
tomorrow, you promise yourself, will be different, yet tomorrow is too often a repetition of today.
author James T. McCay.
is that the one where they fly around in the phone booth?
first of all, it's a police box, not a phone booth.
so, really, they should have just called it "Bill and Ted's Excellent Rip-Off.
I mean, at least then-- - I'm really sorry.
for what? - Asking.
good morning, Angels. New information to report.
the blood at the crime scene matched type to Charlie Sparks, so we can assume that he is the injured party.
well, shell casings by the door says he was shot.
are we looking at a robbery gone wrong?
no robber would break into a family residence before the start of school and not expect to find people home.
no, I think he came for Charlie and Alison Sparks.
he planned the abduction and then gained entry to the house.
but the scene is frenzied, disorganized.
he didn't think it through.
I hate to say it, but could Sammy be our unsub?
I don't think so.
what's the number one motive of kidnapping?
financial gain.
Yeah, well, if that's the case, they are barking up the wrong money tree.
the family runs a music store that's been Sparks owned since the 1940s, but business is down and a loan against the house is the only thing keeping that store afloat.
the unsub should have done his research.
well, he may have.
this area was devastated by the oil spill.
a little bit of money would go a long way here.
first impression-- this is a man on a mission.
he didn't steal a single expensive item from either one of these rooms.
he definitely came for the parents.
no sign of forced entry.
the Sparks most likely recognized him, Hotch.
unless the door was unlocked.
I highly doubt that.
look at the blood pattern.
Charlie was shot as he was moving towards the door.
well, how you figure that?
because of the pools of blood. They're separated by distant steps.
which means he had to be moving quickly, so he was running.
and the closer you get to the door, the more blood there is.
so he was shot right here, reached for his wound instinctively, and then tried to grab the piano to break his fall.
see, the handprint is facing upwards, toward the door, the same way he was facing when he was shot.
Alison was interrupted while she was making Sammy's lunch in the kitchen.
because she heard the doorbell ring.
so she approaches the door, opens it only to find a gun aimed at her face.
so she screams.
that brings Charlie running down the stairs trying to help, but the unsub shoots Charlie because he won't back off.
Charlie's severely wounded.
why does the unsub take the time to drag him out of the house knowing that he's leaving a 10-year-old witness home alone?
the unsub must have known the family well enough to realize that Sammy would never be capable of I. D.ing him.
Hi, Sammy. I'm DR. Spencer Reid. What are you drawing?
some autistic children don't handle touch well.
it's possible that witnessing his parents' abduction pushed him into emotional overload and he shut down.
look at that.
is he trying to tell us something?
Sammy. We're looking for your mom and your dad.
did "L" take them?
Garcia... - Yes, sir.
I need you to run a list of all known associates to the Sparks family, focusing on everyone whose first or last name begins with the letter "l.
well, it looks like they were open to alternative methods of payment.
there's some construction work for a child's drum set and cleaning services for sheet music.
bartering must be popular in a cash-strapped area like this.
they have video surveillance, which is good news.
do you think the unsub was here?
it's possible. These guys like to scout their targets prior to abduction.
they get off on the fact the victims never see them coming.
there's a lot they don't teach us at the Academy.
experience handles the rest.
let's get these tapes to Garcia.
well, the kid definitely likes to draw, but I can't quite figure out what it is he's drawing.
that's a dog.
how can you possibly know that that looks like a dog?
I don't know. Maybe a dad knows.
well, I didn't see a dog outside. Did you?
they use these for occupational therapy, but they're soft.
those things are expensive, too.
that's a favorite.
I think we should get this to Reid.
he may be able to use it to connect with Sammy.
look at these drawings.
this must be Sammy's desk.
Alison and Charlie really went out of their way to accommodate Sammy's condition.
he must have come here after school every day.
so he was a fixture, not just in the store but in the community.
it's no wonder the Sparks had to take out a loan.
they put all of their money into helping their son.
such dedicated parents.
what happens to Sammy if we can't find them?
Garcia's searching for relatives now.
if she can't find anyone, then he will be turned over to the state, and he'll be placed in a special needs Foster facility.
let's make sure that doesn't happen.
we don't really have special resources to accommodate children like Sammy, so he's in with everybody else.
can he comprehend the material?
not everything.
you know, I've done my best to research alternative teaching methods, but there's only so much I can do.
children with autism normally think very logically.
their minds can pick up patterns that ours normally wouldn't recognize.
Yes, that's right. I've found that repetition and routine are the keys to getting through to him.
you know, that makes sense. Repetition forms patterns on the brain, and as those patterns reoccur, it forms a calming influence on the child.
which would allow new information to be retained.
I'm sure Sammy's parents figured that out, too.
his parents most likely kept him on a strict daily schedule.
Oh, like clockwork.
that's how Sammy was able to walk from his house to school yesterday.
he'd memorized the route.
Yeah, it's 7: 45, time for him to go to school.
he doesn't need to wait for his mom or dad.
he simply grabs an empty lunchbox and heads here.
if Sammy was living on a strict routine, that means Charlie and Alison were, too.
which would have only made them easier targets.
I'm not sure how we're going to get through to him.
Sammy's teacher says he's never even been able to return his own mother's hug.
Garcia, what have you got?
on, E.I wish I could be more help.
due to the spill, fisherman and fishing-related industries have been hit the worst.
sheriff, was it common knowledge that the Sparks had gotten this loan?
I knew. A loan around here is like winning the lottery.
so why no ransom note?
maybe the unsub thinks he can get the money directly from the source, cut out the middleman.
you think he'll use one of the parents as leverage to get the other to clear out their accounts.
he's already shot Charlie.
it shouldn't be that hard to manipulate Alison into doing what he wants if he offers medical assistance in exchange.
I think he just did.
what have you got?
I froze the Sparks' assets earlier today, but someone at the Bayside Branch one parish over just managed to withdraw $10, 000 from their joint savings account.
call the branch. It they're still there, don't let them leave.
Yeah. We're probably too late.
if the unsub has what he's after, Sammy's parents just became expendable.
well, did you get it?
I couldn't get you everything.
how much you get?
10000
what? 10, 000? That's not enough.
I did exactly what you said. I didn't say anything.
please, I need to get back to Sammy.
go knows where he is right now.
I can't do that, Ali.
and Charlie.
Charlie's hurt. He needs a doctor.
no, what he needs is a wife who pays better attention.
I'll never tell you where Charlie is if you don't get my money.
you said that if I got you-- Shut up!
or we're gonna sit here while Charlie bleeds to death, and you're never gonna see Sammy again.
the account was frozen.
how did she take the money out?
we're on an old system.
it only updates every night at midnight.
OK. How much did she want?
well, she wanted to close out her account, but I told her I wouldn't be able to give her everything today.
we can't afford it.
how much is everything?
um... $42, 176. 41.
and the bank does not have that on site?
not anymore.
Mrs. Sparks isn't the first customer to consider closing her accounts.
could we take a look at the security footage you have?
no sign of the unsub.
she doesn't look over her shoulder.
she doesn't try to warn you or anyone else in the bank?
no.
what did she say to you when you told her you couldn't give her all the money?
I told her I could get her 10, 000 now and the rest in 2 days, but she became hysterical and kept saying that that's not enough.
did she tell you what the money was for?
she just asked for what she could get and she left.
the unsub is probably holding Charlie at a secondary location.
which means he might still be alive.
I have run every "L" I can find, think of, or make up in my giant magic head and nothing hits.
I even ran the number 50 in case Sammy has some sort of predilection to Roman numerals.
came up dry.
any luck on finding Sammy's next of kin?
in name only.
Charlie has a sister named Elizabeth that was last reported residing in Mont Belvieu, Tejas.
but she's not responding to calls or email.
Elizabeth. The "L" could stand for Liz or Lizzie.
Garcia, we need to find her and fast.
I will move so fast, the earth will reverse its rotation and time bend backwards.
hello.
all right, so this unsub has the money he needs.
why hasn't he let the Sparks go?
he has to be holding them for a reason.
we might have an answer to that.
Alison tried to withdraw $40, 000 from the branch in Bayside, but she only got 10, 000.
so maybe he's holding them until he gets the money he needs.
I think it's more than that. I think he wants a specific amount.
Alison kept telling the bank manager that 10 grand wasn't enough.
that says to me he's told them what would be.
we believe the man you are looking for is in danger of losing a home, property, or a business.
that's most of the area.
we want to focus on residents with large families, single-income households, anyone with a financial responsibility for others.
that responsibility is probably what drove the unsub into action.
now, he had no intention of hurting either of his victims.
for him, the abduction of Charlie and Alison Sparks was an unfortunate but necessary means ot an end.
this area has been ravaged by last summer's oil spill.
so look for down-and-out fishermen, look for boat owners, or anyone who used to work in the tourist or beach industries.
and compare that list to people working part-time or under-the-table jobs.
this unsub didn't start with extortion, he was pushed there.
this man feels such a strong obligation to his dependents that he's willing to kidnap and steal from people he knows.
he may be in the process of losing someone close to him or has already.
look at recent divorce filings, child custody cases.
the unsub went to a bank in the next parish.
that tells us he has his own mode of transportation, and he is conscious of the FBI's involvement in this case.
by now he realizes the Sparks' accounts are frozen, so he'll be seeking alternative ways to get the rest of the money he needs.
so canvass banks, pawnshops, anyplace that offers quick cash with minimal questions.
thank you very much.
Oh, he's been busy. What are those?
we have no idea. We're trying to find his aunt right now, but we're hoping that maybe in the meantime you'd be able to help us get through to him.
OK, I'll try, but even before this happened, Sammy wasn't wild about talking.
what's that?
these help some kids with autism learn routines.
school bus leaves at 2: 15.
Sammy, what's this?
do you have any idea what that "L" might stand for?
I have no idea. Sammy. Sammy, you're safe.
it's me, Ms. Rogers.
I'm here. I'm here, Sammy. You're safe.
I've never seen that. I don't know what it is.
is he trying to type?
I don't think so.
I think he's trying to play something.
can we get a keyboard in here?
there's a piano at his house.
you want to take a 10-year-old boy back to the crime scene where his father was shot?
Sammy's trying to tell us something.
I think it's important we try to figure out what.
everyone, this is Lizzie Sparks, Sammy's aunt.
help!
don't do that!
are you ok?
ali, you made me do that.
I'm sorry, I didn't want to do that.
are you all right?
why are you doing this?
I ain't got a choice. I gotta get my boys back.
this can't help you get them back.
don't say that.
I got 2 more days to prove that I'm fit. - Fit?
just let me go. Please. - I will.
but you gotta do something for me first.
I still don't see why you have to take him back to that place.
Sammy was playing the piano when his parents were abducted, so taking him back to the exact location might trigger an important response.
no, but he's fragile.
it could also wound him further.
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do here.
you're Sammy's legal guardian right now.
the decision's yours.
no. He barely knows her.
Lizzie, is it? For all we know, she's the "L" he's afraid of.
Sammy saw his aunt and didn't even react.
if she was the abductor, we'd have seen a visceral response.
you can't be sure of that. He's in shock.
we are running a background check right now.
on me?
it's just procedure.
but you have to decide.
what do you want us to do?
I'm sorry, Ali.
I never meant to hurt Charlie.
why didn't you just ask us for the money?
if you were in trouble, we would have helped you.
I couldn't, Ali.
you got Sammy and all and I... I get that.
someday you'll get this.
please, just let us go. I need to get back to my son.
I will.
but I gotta tie you up first.
what?
I'm gonna get my boys, I'm gonna go across the state line, then I'll call 911 and I'll tell them where you and Charlie are and they'll come get you, I promise you.
Charlie doesn't have that kind of time. He needs a doctor.
he'll be fine, I promise.
Oh, no! Charlie.
No...Charlie!
so, the shop owner gave Alison Sparks 25 grand.
she wanted 30, but the owner balked.
she's got 25 from here, 10 from the bank.
he's up to 35, but he wants 40.
why is that a special number?
we should call Garcia and have her run those numbers against the list
she compiled of local residents and foreclosures, see if anything matches up.
OK, I'll call her right now.
well, what do you make of that?
it looks like it was used as a weapon.
I'm betting this belongs to our guy.
you see how it's rusted at the hook end?
give me a hint.
it's an old Fisherman's trick.
you can use the crowbar to hook crab traps and shrimp catches out at sea.
it's probably pretty common around here.
Yeah, but outside the same store Alison Sparks was last seen?
our unsub is definitely a fisherman.
we found him. - Where?
he's headed for D. C. we'll meet you there.
are we sure it's him?
it's Doyle, all right.
I'm looking at him right now.
he chartered a private jet.
Prentiss: How did he get past security checks?
he used an alias-- Chuck Murray.
wasn't that-- Yeah. The name of his Irish wolfhound.
he's baiting us.
he wants us to know he's here.
message received.
let that bastard come to us.
when was the last time you saw him?
on his 5th birthday.
5 years. - Charlie and I had a fight.
it got ugly.
I haven't seen either one of them since.
do you think Charlie's going to be ok?
I'm hopeful.
reid: Sammy, would it be all right if I sat here?
you've been holding out on me, Sammy.
I didn't know you could play, Reid.
I can't. Well, I never have before, but it's essentially all math.
Sammy, how about you play this note...
for yes... And this note...
for no.
does that sound like something you could do?
Yeah, exactly.
just like that.
now, Sammy, do you remember when the man came and took your parents away?
Sammy, I don't understand.
does this song mean something to you?
I have run "L" for Lizzie and nothing suspicious.
her story checks out.
what about local financial records?
I have cross-referenced every current and formerly licensed fisherman, crab men, shrimp men, friends of Poseidon, comes from the sea, you name it men with financial records showing default loans totaling over 35k.
OK, what did you find? - 127 names.
I know, do not shoot the messenger.
just tell me how to narrow it down.
do all 127 have children?
no, but 76 do.
OK, how many of them have homes in foreclosure versus other debt that might not put them out onto the streets?
Oh, you are very good.
we are officially down to 24.
send us those files.
at cybertastic speeds, my sweets.
everything all right?
I'm a stranger in my own brother's house.
my nephew doesn't recognize me.
and then I find this.
Charlie told Sammy about me.
I always assumed that he'd never know who I was.
do you mind my asking what the fight was about?
I was the one who suspected Sammy had autism.
Charlie didn't see it.
he was so upset, he kicked me out.
how did you know?
he was...different.
so I did some research.
Charlie was blind to it.
he refused to accept what I found.
he was afraid.
any father would be, learning his child isn't going to have it as easy as he did.
you sound like you talk from experience.
Reid, take a look at this.
what, at Sammy's flip book?
not just a flip book. His routine.
shower, brush teeth, dress.
his entire life is planned in order.
maybe we can figure out where Sammy met the unsub.
he already figured it out.
Sammy sees his life in pictures.
he's been trying to speak with us, but he only knows how to communicate through symbols.
look, it's his language.
anchors. Like my socks.
and that's the tread on your shoes.
what does the "L" mean?
it's not an "L." It's a time.
3: 00. The time Sammy wants us to know about, the time that he met the unsub.
where was he at 3: 00?
2: 30, music store.
he goes there every day after school, and he doesn't leave until the store closes at 6: 00.
Hey, Sammy.
Sammy, it's almost 3: 00.
is there someplace you should be?
should be store.
no, no, let him go.
Hotch, I think we've got something.
Morgan, we need to fast-forward to 3 p. m.
if I'm right, the unsub is somewhere on this tape.
Reid, here's when Sammy gets to the store.
they changed the music. Why would they do that?
it's for Sammy.
classical might be more comforting than Hard Rock.
OK, here's 3: 00.
that's the song.
Sammy's been trying to tell us who took his parents all along.
at 3 p. m.the song plays, the same song every day at the same time because Charlie Sparks puts the CD in at 2: 30 when Sammy arrives.
Sammy's never late because Sammy sticks to a schedule, a routine.
30 minutes later... This man arrives.
a deliveryman with a routine all of his own.
we need to figure out who that is, because he's our unsub.
former fisherman turned part-time deliveryman, saddled with more debt than he and his recently removed sons could sustain, including a foreclosing house and a defaulted boat loan.
why didn't you tell me you were looking for Bill Thomas at 1024 Elmwood Avenue?
what about his boat?
docked in the marina.
we're closer to the house.
OK, we'll take the boat. Let's go.
FBI!
Morgan, he's not here.
I know, Hotch. We got him.
this is the FBI!
give yourself up! Your boat is surrounded!
we don't want anyone else to get hurt, Bill.
turn yourself in!
all right, listen up.
we move in as soon as SWAT is in position.
what's going on in there?
are you gonna respond?
I had it, Ali.
a dream. Not a big one.
it was my dream.
I put food on the table.
I had a family.
they loved me.
he was my dream.
here. Take this.
what are you doing?
I can't take care of my boys if I go to jail.
bill, I can't.
if I do it myself, they won't get my life insurance policy.
just do it.
no. I'm not like you.
I know the difference between right and wrong.
you will, damn it.
you will do it. Look at all I took away from you.
Charlie, he's gone. He ain't never comin' back.
you understand that?
you're gonna be alone at Sammy's graduation.
he's never gonna hear the voice of his father or even remember what it sounds like.
stop. - Charlie's not gonna read to you in bed.
he told me he did that, didn't he?
he's not gonna kiss you. - Stop.
you're never gonna feel his touch again.
you're gonna grow old alone, Ali.
alone.
your dream's over.
move in!
ma'am. Ma'am, are you hurt?
I knew you were watching me.
what's the expression?
keeps your friends close, your enemies under surveillance?
I've been here for 2 hours.
you should know better than to keep a lady waiting.
it seems hypocritical, seeing as I had to wait 7 years.
Hello, Ian.
Hello, Lauren.
Oh, wait.
Lauren Reynolds died in a car accident, didn't she?
what do you want?
you.
Oh, not today. Don't worry about that.
but soon.
I've got a Glock leveled at your crotch.
what's to stop me from taking you and the little ones out right now?
you'd never make it back to your car and you know it.
tell me, does the lovely Penelope know the truth about you?
or is she too busy watching movies with Derek to care?
here you are, all alone, while Aaron sits at home with his son.
and why didn't Dave and Ashley invite you to their game night?
maybe they thought you'd be on the Metro with DR. Reid.
Oh, that one does have some quirks.
come near my team and I will end you.
I don't have a quarrel with them.
how long that remains the case depends entirely on you.
they're innocent.
you are not.
I was doing my job.
I think you did a little more than that.
you took the only thing that mattered to me.
so I'm going to take the only thing that matters to you.
your life.
Honore de Balzac once said,"most people of action are inclined to fatalism, and most of thought believe in Providence.
tell me, Emily Prentiss, which do you think you're going to be?
Ian Doyle vanished from prison.\NInterpol can't find him.
am I in danger? We all are.
as far as Doyle is concerned,
Lauren Reynolds died in a car accident.
you died and we're all good.
how did he get past security checks?\NHe chartered a private jet.
he used an alias. He sent me flowers, so I think it's safe to assume he's coming here.
Hello, Lauren.
Oh, wait. Lauren Reynolds died in a car accident, didn't she?
I was doing my job.\NYou took the only thing that mattered to me.
so I'm going to take the only thing that matters to you...
your life.
a strong storm is expected to hit the eastern seaboard within the next 72 hours.\NCould be a bad one.
let's see how it's looking right now.
now, what we have is an area of low pressure that's getting stronger and moving off the eastern seaboard.
then comes the fear of damage...
5: 30 on the dot, as promised.
and at the same time, another heavy snowfall event will create travel chaos and power outages throughout the district.
cold air moves in...
getting ready for the storm. Can you believe it?
Hey, I'm talking to you!
don't make me come and get you.
I used to fit into this.
I blame your cooking.
it's just too damn fine.
like your ass.
now let's go. We're late.
Frank? Honey, you ok?
I love you.
please, please, my family has done nothing to you.
please, I beg you. Why are you doing this?
please, my son. My son. Let my son go.
he's innocent.
good evening.
luckily for you I'm not working for Doyle.
we got on three stops ago.
we?
you ok?
Ian Doyle is here in DC.
how can you be so sure?\NI sat next to him last night.
what?
he said if I warned my team or told anyone, he'd kill them.
why didn't he kill you?
and more to the point, why didn't you kill him?
he's not working alone. Then he's just playing with you.
no, no, he's a power assertive psychopath. He doesn't play games.
he's meticulous. He plans everything down to the last detail.
Yeah, that last detail being you.
maybe you should tell your team.
no. No way. This isn't their fight.
and I won't take that risk.\NWe stay together, we can get him.
we already tried. Look how that ended up.
wait. Wait. When you went undercover,
I promised no one would harm you.
I'm not undercover anymore.
DC isn't his comfort zone, it's mine.
this ends here.
two dc homes torched, two families, on the same night,\Nlast night.
I'm surprised it still hasn't hit the news.\NIt's already mid-day.
Yeah. All anyone's talking about is this storm that may or may not hit.
I managed to find an online article about the fires written by this guy Jeff Hastings, but no one's running with it.
how strange. They usually thrive on tragedy.
Yeah, and it gets weirder.
Ron and Lauren Cosenza and their 10-year-old son\Nwere found in the master bedroom of their home, each shot through the forehead.\NThe gun belonged to the father.
Murder-suicide?
well, it looks like Metro PD's investigation is going that way, but it's still the first 48. They want our help.
kerry and Frank Fagan, like the Cosenzas, were found in their master bedroom\Nfrom a suspected gas leak.
it had to be massive to cause that.
how does the news miss a house explosion?
any connection between the families?\NOnly one. A continent.
kerry Fagan was born in Germany,\NRon Cosenza is from Italy.
so 2 of the 5 victims are from Europe. How does that help?
it doesn't. I'm just stating the facts, and the facts happen to be...
guys, I'm sorry I'm late.\NYou ok?
Yeah, it's just one of those weeks, I guess.
I'm sorry. What did I miss? Arsonist?
one appears to be murder-suicide, the other a freak accident.
so why are we looking at it?
house fires are rare. Add to that a few Miles apart, within the same hour, kind of tips the scales of coincidence.
Yeah, if somebody did this, they're highly motivated and organized.
and if he wants to strike again, he's got 72 hours before the storm shuts the city down.
what's his name? I'm sorry?
Oh, answering a question with a question. That's interesting.
stop it. Stop what, probing?
seriously.
I'm gonna make it my life's work to find out who this boy is...
stop. Just stop.
we have enough to worry about already, don't we?
lao Tzu said, "when I let go of what I am,
I become what I might be.
OK, thanks.
that was weird. They're not coming.
there was some mix-up with Metro pd\Nand we're on our own.
what do you got?\NWell, the fire didn't spread because they had hard-wired smoke alarms\Nand a sprinkler system.
what's with the security.
why the steel door? What did he do for a living?
Oh, computer networking, and the Fagans were financial advisors.
these neighborhoods don't require anything\Nmore than an average deadbolt, certainly nothing on the bedroom doors.\NIt's like a panic room.
Yeah, but there's nothing in this room that's high tech.
there's no surveillance cameras, average alarm system.
in an average area.
but he had a 40-caliber and a load of locks.
what was this guy afraid of?
or who. Maybe himself.
if he actually killed his family,\Nthen he's been hiding something.
there is no history of any kind of psychological weirdness with either family.\NThey were healthy, happy, fit.
until last night. Any signs of financial stress?
no. They were healthy on that front, too.
what's with the... Oh. The heat is out in my lair.
not a single snowflake has fallen\Nand yet the weather remains the top news story.
nothing about these cases?\NNo. They're bound to get hip to it.
once our presence is felt and we connect the cases, it'll be a ballroom blitz.
what is it?\NYou know, considering the time these fires occurred, the habitual patterns of both families\Nwere in direct conflict with where the bodies were found.
the master bedroom.
Yeah, normally Lauren Cosenza would be downstairs\Nhelping her son with his homework, and Ron wouldn't even be home from work yet.\NWhat about the Fagans?
their routines were less established.
they traveled a lot. But they were expected\Nat a dinner party last night.
if someone did this, what are the chances these victims are random?
what do you think?
two families, same night, mysterious deaths.
doesn't happen every day.
the gas leak at the Fagan house and then the other fire suspected to be set by Mr. Cosenza to cover the murder-suicide.
well, I know the investigators reported that, but it doesn't fit with what I found.
the Cosenza family didn't have any smoke in their lungs.
he killed them, set the fire, then killed himself. That fits.
he didn't have signs of smoke inhalation either.
even though the fire started in the master bedroom?
he should have had traces of smoke, even if it was a minute before he pulled the trigger on himself.
he was dead when the fire started.
Garcia hasn't found any connection between the victims.
there has to be one. On paper they're perfect.
everything's clean.\NBut what happened to them last night was anything but.
you ok?
people text like it's not as intrusive as a phone call.
you know, you haven't had a vacation in a while.\NWeren't you talking about Italy?
my mother extended her trip there.
it wouldn't be much of a vacation.
it's a big country.
not big enough.
well, think about it.
I will.
and pick a place where that thing won't work.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
I thought you were in there.
are you ok? Yeah, I'm... I'm...
I'm sure these victims overlap somehow.
Garcia pulled their phone numbers, but so far I can't find anything.
you just jumped.
I've been having these really intense headaches lately.
have you seen a doctor?
Yeah, a few. None of them have been able to figure it out.
Oh. I'm...Sorry.
does anyone know?
you.
I won't tell anyone.
I know. They'd just worry.
not that you're not gonna worry,\Nbut they'll just make me feel like a baby.
you know? I do.
how are you? I'm good.
you've been picking your fingernails again.\NYeah.
you only do that when you're stressed.\NIt's just a bad habit.
you coming? Yeah. I'll be there in a minute.
the media blitz I promised never came.
the original online article written by a one Mr. Jeff Hastings... pulled.
so with your permission, sir, I would like to track him down and figure out what the hell is going on.
it's a small one. What's the connection?
both families coach soccer on the hill.
the Fagans didn't have children.
no. But kerry Fagan coached her godson's team.
the two victims from Europe were the soccer coaches.
it makes sense, doesn't it?
I'm beginning to think that they've crossed paths before.
I ran the victims' phone numbers.\NThey never contacted each other, but there is a common number between them. Give it.
Byron Delaney, his wife grace died last summer,\Nchildren grown.
what do you know? He's British.
Garcia, send me the address. I'll grab Prentiss.\NSent.
so what's your take on these guys?
they're contradicting themselves,\Nexposing bodies but then going through all of this to hide it.
do you think they wanted us on the case?
us, the BAU? Why would they?
ego. Control.\NSome kind of agenda.
I don't think we're even on their radar, Prentiss. Do you?
you're right.
why would we be?
put the shoe back on.
hold up. What is it?
black fella and a woman. White.
Yeah. Are they alone? Is it her?
Yeah.
you sure this is it?
maybe nobody's home.
Garcia never got an answer.
Prentiss, get down!
move! Move!
keep moving.
look out!
let's go.
get in the van.
No! Wait!
go, go, go, go!
well, this is one story that's not gonna get buried.
he's just a kid. He can't be more than 25.
a kid with an assault weapon isn't just a kid anymore.
4 rounds total.
that one's yours. You hit his femoral artery.
he was dead and they knew it.
bet he didn't bargain on that when he signed up.
he's got 2 shots to the head and then one in the wrist. Why the wrist?
to make sure he can't return fire?
he was dead before his head hit the sidewalk.
he's got a tattoo, at least what's left of one.
they blew a hole through the tattoo because we could have I. D.'D him.
so they're confident we can't I. D. His face or prints.
no GSWs, no signs of strangulation.
his shoe's untied.
injected between the toes.
made to look like a heart attack.
armor tech windows, 6-pin locks on the entrance door.
same as the Fagans and the Cosenzas.
20, 000 in cash.
passport. This guy was on the move.
outgoing calls.
3218. That's kerry Fagan.
10: 30 A. M.
10: 31, Delaney calls the Cosenzas.
both calls last only seconds.
didn't leave a message. Didn't try to warn them.
somebody warned him.
if not on the phone then in person.
whatever these victims have in common or whatever they were a part of...
didn't happen on U. S. soil.
3 of the 6 victims are from Europe.
and the mini beryl says they're serious.
we saw how they move. They've got be ex-military.
european hit squad cleaning house?\NIt's happened before.
they could have taken us out... easily.
why didn't they? FBI agents gunned down in DC would have definitely started a war.
a war this kid wasn't prepared for.
he's just a foot soldier.
whoever shot him is the leader.
someone must have warned Byron Delaney to get out.
and whoever it is is next on the list.
thank you.
the helmsman's wife.
I just finished it. It's so sad.
I just started it.
Oh! Sorry. It's a great read to that bit.
the end, the sad bit, with the wife, super tragic. You know?
I do now.
you're Jeff, right? You are...
Penelope Garcia. Nice to see you.
I'm sorry, I don't think we've met.
Oh, we haven't.
I've with the FBI. Good for you.
why did you pull that story?
you should know.\NThe FBI didn't tell you to pull it, did they?
no, no, no, I'm not saying Jack to you.
you already ruined one ending for me.
listen, two families died in those fires.
you were suspicious and you were right to be.
you don't look like an agent to me.
I'm a...Hired nerd for the behavioral analysis unit.
you think it's a serial killer?
I think that theory\Nshould be at the beginning part of your story.
there's no story.
not... not the one that I want to tell.
OK, maybe not now, but when whoever is telling you to pull it is no longer a threat, with the right source it could be front page.
it could be the next Watergate. It could lead to a book.
your book.
the threat being to the shareholders.
shareholders that are affected detrimentally?
I think you mean financially.
follow the money?
Oh, that sounds like a very good ending.\NFor you, I mean.
Yes, it does.
Reid, you got anything?
the damage is pretty extensive, but luckily some of the tattoo remains.
Seaver, get the victim's photo out to the press.
I think I know who dug the hole.\NThe journo told me to follow the money, like straight up, that's what he told me, so I did.
it turns out "the gazette" is owned by a multinational global conglomerate... oil, new technologies, shipping,\Nair and ground transportation, all of which employ the services of one company... CWS.
clear water securities? You know them?
I've come across them.
they're a private counterintelligence group out of Geneva.
Ron Cosenza, Byron Delaney, kerry Fagan\Nall worked for CWS.
7 years ago. How long ago?\NSeaver, hang up.
do we have a problem?
well, CWS does.
got it.
what's going on? Are you ok?
Oh, uh, yeah, I'm good.
I'm not a profiler, but you...
don't start.
I'm sorry.
I'm...I'm gonna be all right.
OK.
I'm just really worried about you.
I think the flu is going around.
are you pregs?
no. No.
no, I'm just... I'm not sleeping.
I'm having this nightmare.
it's a recurring nightmare.
I...
there's a hill, and there's a little girl on top of the hill.
she's like 6 years old, dark hair.
and she's just dancing in the sun.
but somehow I know that she's waiting for me, so I start to walk up the hill...
but the hill gets steeper and steeper, and by the time I climb to the top, the little girl's gone.
and I look everywhere for her, and when I can't find her,
I start to panic.
and I panic because I know what's waiting out there for her.
I know what the world can do to a girl who only sees beauty.
like you.
somehow you... you always make me smile.
and I don't think I've ever thanked you for that.
Hotch needs you in the Scif.
OK.
Quantico Sensitive compartmented information facility
exactly why did you bring us here?
and why is the BAU interested in CWS?
why did you pull that story?
that's how you remember them.
and that is now they are now.
you warned your friend Byron Delaney.
you knew him the longest. It's too bad you were too late.
if you're looking for reactions, this is our business.
business? Ugly as that sounds.
kerry Fagan, Ron Cosenza, and Byron Delaney, they all worked for CWS.
as do 40, 000 other subcontractors all over the world.
so they were subcontracted to you.
if you're looking for answers, take it up with the main contractor.
and that would be? Your government.
whoever is killing these families\Nholds your company responsible, not the government.
we run operations from the middle east to Antarctica.
going over them all will take months.
so you've already started investigations?
that's why you pulled the story.
the cases these people were involved in are protected by a multinational official secrets agreement.
even if I wanted to...
these people were killed on U. S. soil by trained suspects who fired on federal agents.
as a courtesy and out of respect for the predicament your company now faces,\Neverything in this room is off the record.
however, outside this room,\Nif you withhold information about the case, you and your company will be held fully accountable.
all right. What do you know?
we're looking for a European team, with considerable training.
and for one of them, it's personal.
why do you think that?
because they could have spared the child, but they chose not to.
the killing of Samuel Cosenza by one of the team was personal.
one of the attackers shot last night had the remains of a tattoo on his wrist.
on the surface the tattoo may look like a simple four-leaf clover.
but the stem has a "v" at the end.
we believe this is associated with a hidden sect of fallen warriors.
it's also the name of a ship famous for its journeys from dublin to America,\Nthe "Valhalla.
have you seen that before?
we ran an operation to capture the leader of a breakaway ira faction years ago.
he assumed that moniker.
what's his name?
happy Birthday, my love.
OK, Ian Doyle's officially on everyone's list.
his mug is all over the place.
he's not gonna be able to get out of the district\Nunless he sprouts wings himself.
it's not that I'm not happy that we have his name, but how are we supposed to know who's on his list?
we study his life\Nand every single person he's ever come in contact with.
look, Doyle's been away for 7 years, but he still managed to figure out who the players were.
maybe we should start with how he got out of prison.
russia, I think. Well, where was he locked up?
actually, there are no extradition papers on him.
was Doyle on your radar when you were at interpol?
uh, sure, I had heard of him, but direct contact?
I'd have to ask around.
do.
good guys and bad keep files close to them.
what are in these files?
it's intel. Insurance. Protection. For times like this.
maybe I should go to Byron Delaney's house and see what I can find.
take Prentiss with you. She might have some insight.
no one's getting back to you?
I only have a couple of contacts, but they'll get back to me.
what, are we being followed, 007?
no, but you should go through the city.
66 is gonna be miserable right now.\NWe'll get there.
Oh, before Doyle takes somebody else out?
he's shooting up federal agents. What's he gonna do next?
what would you like me to do?
get creative with your driving.\NI'm working on it, Prentiss.
Hey. Thanks for getting back. I need some intel on Ian Doyle.
are you alone?
not at all. Anything you can spare.
is your team in danger?\NAbsolutely. You should start with our victims,
Ron Cosenza, kerry Fagan, Byron Delaney.
see if they connect to Doyle in any way.
I'll send you a document.
I'll be waiting for it. Thanks.\NThey got something?
I don't know. We'll see.
you know, Emily, you really need to trust people.
I trust people. No, you don't.
you don't because you can't.
and I get it. Every time you tried to count on someone, they let you down, so you go it alone.
you'll never admit that because you're just too damn stubborn.
it's all right. It doesn't really matter.
but I'll tell you what does matter.
that you can trust me, Emily.
with anything.
I'm serious. No matter how awful you think it is,
I promise you, you are not alone.
I just wish you'd believe that.
I do.
you profile me again, you'll wish you hadn't.
the more players we get on this board, the sooner Erin will get her nose in it.
Strauss already knows.\NI'm surprised she wasn't in the Scif.
she's on vacation.
Oh, great. Now she'll never take another one.
is everything about this guy classified?
somebody knows him. We just haven't found them yet.
there's a safe in the bedroom. Behind a big painting?
Yeah, it's not gonna be in there.
it's gonna be somewhere where he can sit and still gain access to it.
and he's gotta be quick.
get outta here.
that's Dreyer.
kerry Fagan, Ron Cosenza.
Delaney's not in it. Why would he have that picture?
maybe he was their handler.
here's the million-dollar question...
anyone know what language that is?\NThose are villages in north Korea.
I love you. Of course she does.
there's a political prison near Haengyong-ni.
camp 22. Kwan-li-so.
north Korea denies it exists.
you think they took Doyle there?
that would explain why he's after them.\NEven his prison is off the grid.
all we know is that he was never married, had multiple residences, and was arrested at his tuscan villa.\NThere's paperwork to back that up?
and a list of who was there that day. There may be photographs.
Reid's looking into that now.
right. So those people need to be warned that he's on the warpath.
they have been. But there's a whole different life he's led,\None that isn't in any file.
Prentiss, did you hear from your European associates?
I'm waiting for them to send me a document. We need it now.
he's locked in this hellhole for 7 years.
how did he get out? Does it really matter?
Doyle was in Kwan-Li-so?
Ah. Well, that was on a need-to-know.
you didn't think I needed to know that? Are you kidding me?
and what good would that do?
you don't get to decide what's good for me anymore.
what else aren't you telling me? That's it.
you said he was in Russia.
no, actually, Sean McAllister told you that.
Tsia? Yeah.
get him off the phone. What are you gonna do, em?
huh? What are you gonna do? You gonna run away?
Yeah, you're good at that. Tsia.
bloody hell.
OK.
you can't trust him.
you have got to get out of there right now.
you are safer on your own.
do you remember 9th street? Corelli's. How the door works?
Yeah. He's still there.
you will be in and out in 5 minutes.
got it.
do not let Clyde follow you.
and, tsia, be careful.
you, too.
fine.
Hey, what's that?
uh, oh, this is the only lead I have so far.
what about you? Seaver said you were looking for photos of, uh, Doyle's tuscan villa?
I couldn't find any stills from the day he was arrested, but there may be some surveillance footage from the sedans.
they generally record everything. Yeah?
bank accounts traceable to our first two victims.
you get a document from your contacts?
we might be able to match the rest of those faces.
good.
what else have you found?
OK, look in the peephole.
my mother made it.
Christmas.
Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.
that journalist is eating out of my hand.
he had no idea I was promising him a full-fledged manhunt.
it's way more than that. I've counted reps from 5 agencies.
Oh, I love me and multi-agency taskforcing, and on our turf. It gets my blood up.
when are we going to get started?
Oh, he's drawing up the battle plan with the troops.
what's holding us up?
we're waiting for somebody from DC Metro Police, then we can start.
who's got updates on roadblocks?
they will. All parkways and interstates in dc, Maryland, and Virginia have station checkpoints.\NDoyle has the means to get in and out of the country.
what makes you think he won't get out of the district?\NIt's the best we've got right now.
metro got held up. Double homicide on k and 9th.
they want me to take a look.
Doyle? Vic's apartment looks like a black market forger.
the other victim?
a woman, 30s, no I. D. outside his door.
I'm coming with you.
go.
Hey. You sure you want to leave?
we're only passing through.
but she's the one.
you just gonna leave her?
think she'll follow us?
me. She'll follow me.
Why? Because she must.
this guy took 2 in the chest.
he went quickly.
one straight to the forehead.
the holes were made by a . 45.
so she comes to the door, and he shoots her.
she didn't stand a chance.
this has to be the work of our guy.
she might be on our list. We should run her prints.
I need some air.
what did you do, pull a whiskey Pete's?
uh, I don't know what that means.
but if it involves getting vomit on your boots, then, yeah, I'm guilty.
you need a soda? What can I do?
I live 10 minutes from here. Can we just swing by?
cause I think I got it on my pants, too.\NHotch wants us to get back.
I know. I'll be really quick, I promise.
OK.
it'd be so easy to take her out here and now.
she hasn't confessed yet.
all roads coming and going are blocked.
if we don't make it out of here, she wins again.
have a little faith.
it's not often that we know a subject's name, and in this case, knowing Ian Doyle's identity doesn't give us very much.
he's known to a select few, and those who know him well either work beside him or they're on his list.
2 or 3 of his victims worked for cws and were responsible for his transport to north Korea.
there were 7 operatives on the mission altogether,\Nand the remaining 5 have been warned.
all the federal and international agents responsible for tracking him down are now on his list of targets.
we'll find Doyle the way we find any other offender...
by studying his behavior.
we'll dissect his every move since he regained his freedom.
when he escaped from north Korea,\Nhe killed a man and he used his vehicle to cross the border into Russia.
you good?\NI'm good.
journalist Dorothy Dix wrote, "confession is always weakness.
the grave soul keeps its own secrets and takes its own punishment in silence.
to BE CONTINUED...
they get soggy is all I'm saying.
Hey, you let 'em sit too long, they taste like mush.
then eat 'em when you pour 'em.\NWhat if something comes up?
what if you have to use the bathroom?
Where's yolanda? Relax. She's picking up the chips.
they're out of guacamole. I don't like guacamole.
I got chips.
how are we gonna have chips with no guacamole?
I have a hypothetical for you.
how long till after you pour your cereal do you wait to put it in your mouth?
I don't eat cereal.
she doesn't eat cereal.
with an ass like that, she eats something.
that's enough. 25 even.
what do you think, Ben?
no. I-I'm going home to sleep.
Why? She'd be so nice for us.
come on. Let's do it, Ben.
stop.
what else you gonna do, huh?\NNo, I, um...
come on, guys.
let's do this, and then you can sleep.
let's go, Ben.
OK.
Penelope, you gotta stop staring at her.
Prentiss wouldn't want us to sulk. You know that.
I'm not sulking.
I'm surrounded by testosterone now.
she would also want us to embrace Seaver.
I baked.
congratulations, gradua?
Kevin ate the "t.
and the "e.
come on, you.
listen, I got an idea.
you and I could eat the "u" and the "a,
and that way it would say "congratulations, grad.
and here I always imagined you feeding me strawberries.
Yes. Yes, you do.
thank you.
how you doing? All right.
I'm worried about the team.
and Strauss thinks that adding a probationary agent is gonna solve our problems.\NSeaver knows she's not replacing Prentiss.
I know. And she's got potential, but we need an experienced profiler and we need one now.
have you started looking yet?\NYeah. Let me know if you have any ideas.
congratulations, agent seaver.
thank you.
I did. Who made the cupcakes?
thank you all for coming to my graduation. It meant a lot.
let's get started.\NOk, we're going to Portland, Oregon, and it's not for a dead moon concert.
so, Jay Johnson, a dj, was cutting through an alley on his way home after leaving a club when he was bludgeoned by a pipe and then stabbed 31 times.
his watch, his cell, and his computer were stolen. That was 2 days ago.
now, early this morning,
Karen Heywood, a 30-year-old nurse, she died during a home invasion.\NShe was stabbed 40 times, but first she was bludgeoned with weapons of opportunity.
8 different ones, to be exact.
that's too many weapons for one person.\NThere was a left- and a right-handed killer according to the m. E. Report.
Yeah, but 8 different weapons.
so we're looking for a group. Yeah, it seems that way.
and the left-handed wounds were deeper than the right.
maybe a woman was involved? Or a weak man.
anything taken from the house?\NAccording to a neighbor, just some random stuff...
a computer, some jewelry, a framed picture of a Lily.
and pawnable items.
what do we have, serial-killing crooks? Sounds like a musical.
similar victimology... young professionals killed 3 miles apart.
is there a gang situation in Portland?
minimal. This seems more like desperate people in need of quick cash.
why kill them if it's just for the money? That's what we have to find out.
and we've got 8 hours till nightfall. Let's go.
what the hell you doing? I'm trying to sleep.
it's 2: 00 in the afternoon, buddy.
you want some, baby? No, I want... I want to sleep.
not until you get cleaned up.
lizette Reese wrote,\N "the old faiths light their candles all about, but burly truth comes by and puts them out.
so both victims around the same age and killed at night.
one in an alley on the way to his car, the other in her home after coming from the grocery after work.
there's extreme overkill in both.
overkill usually implies a personal relationship.
or it could mean that the victim represents someone for whom the killer has extreme anger.
these unsubs are night owls, stalking and killing other night owls.
and they're also disorganized.
in one they subdued their victims by hitting them with a pipe found at the scene, and in the other they used a knife, followed by 7 other items found in the kitchen.
a doorstop, even a ceramic cat.
all of this just to steal?
when a gang mentality sets in, unsubs become more capable of heinous acts.
it's still odd. The incidence of robbery is so low in this area.
that's why I started working a geographical profile.
first things first, I factored in journey to crime distance.
if you look here, you'll see that this area of Portland is well within the expected 5-mile radius.
I also factored in distance of decay.
what does distance have to do with decay?
it's how geo-profilers measure relative probability of an offender traveling outside his comfort zone.
unsubs prefer to stay in an area that they know well.
like you'd commute to work or to the gym.
the closer the crime scenes, the greater likelihood it is that the unsub lives or works nearby.
based on my algorithm, the unsubs either live or work in the area.
your sink needs a new washer.
you got a washer in here?
no. I don't work for you.
you sure about that, Ben?
maybe we should do a home store run.
just put a bowl underneath it.
Aw, come on. Laziness is next to slothfulness, Ben.
there's a 24-hour home store near the freeway.
come... come on, guys.
get your keys.
no.
are you back-talking me?
I just... I don't feel like going.
I don't care how you feel.
now get your keys and let's go.
the neighborhood's very concerned.
detective, did your people process the crime scene?
we wanted you to take a look at it.\NMaybe you'll see something we missed.
the me's report says she died after the second stab wound because they hit an artery. The other wounds didn't bleed.
so why inflict 38 more? We see it sometimes with groups.
the fact that others are involved helps each of them rationalize their own violent behavior.
like manson and the genocide in Darfur.
these unsubs like the feeling of killing.
they get a high from the adrenaline release.
Yeah, but that lasts only as long as the victim keeps struggling.
that's not what happened here.
so Mr. Johnson exits the nightclub through the back door to get to his car.
maybe one unsub can watch from over there and the other from back there.
then when he gets here, another unsub hits him with a pipe and it's game on.
look at the vials, Reid. This is a drug corridor.
that would explain why there's so much overkill. Maybe they were on something.
on the jet I did some research into the club.
a year ago, someone o. D.'D inside.
since then, new management's clamped down on the partying.
which means the unsubs most likely fit in to this area.
well, if you can't party inside, then you come out out here.
they're probably all the same age.
Yeah, mid-20s.
I checked the back.
there's a flat-screen, a desktop, and a bicycle.
now, if this group's going for pawnable items, why take a picture of a Lily and other random things?
maybe they ran out of time.
it's not a busy neighborhood.\NIs the tv bolted down?
no. So a group of unsubs would have grabbed it.
what if we're looking for a single unsub?
you think all these footprints were made by one person?
a group so disorganized wouldn't do something as hyper-organized as wearing the same shoe.
no, I don't think it's a group.
I think it's one very erratic killer.
I'll let Morgan know.
you're sure you didn't see a group here that night?
no. Just that woman and a few other people, but no groups.
look, if our cameras worked, you could see for yourself.
is it possible there was a group out in the parking lot?\NIt's a ghost town. Nothing happens here that late.
all right, tell me where you saw Karen first.
she was buying cookies, and then she went to the register.
any other customers there?
there was one at the other checkout.
why would you have 2 registers open that time of night?
there was this weird guy, mumbling to himself and swatting the air like someone was bugging him.
can you ring me up over here?
no problem. What did this guy look like?
regular white dude.
greasy. He was buying salt, bag of chips, water.
did this guy and Karen interact? I have a hypothetical for you.
he said something to her, but she blew him off.
just put her head down and said something dismissive back?
Yeah, that's it. Yeah.
we tend to do that when strange people talk to us.\NUnfortunately, it can backfire.
Yeah, Hotch. You were right. He was by himself, but he was acting strange, like he was being followed.
Reid and seaver went to the club and found that the first victim was killed in an area of high drug use. If he's hallucinating, it could be pcp.
that would explain why he stole random things from Karen's place.
he was out of it. And the erratic patterns in the stabbing.
the adrenaline rush from the drugs is probably behind the overkill.
go ahead, Garcia.
OK, I checked all the local pawn shops to see if any of those stolen items had shown up there.
I'm coming up empty. Maybe he's trading the goods for drugs.
what do you mean, he? We're talking about a group, right?
no, we think it's a solo addict who's hallucinating that he's not alone.
Wow. That is a game-changer. Thanks.
what in hell are you waiting for? Ben!
shut up.
take the friggin' hammer and bang him in the head.
no.
n-not this time.
it's what we came here to do. Be a man, Ben.
I am a man. Take the hammer.
that's why we went to the home store, Ben.
wh-what if I don't?
come on! Hurry up!
fine! Stop yelling at me!
do it.
that a boy.
so, the time of death was about the same as the last two kills.
he's continuing the postmortem stabbing.
I counted 40 wounds.
he's accelerating. Two kills one day apart.
if he's on pcp, he'd be so violent he'd use every muscle he had.
he'd strangle, kick, bludgeon.
the bedroom's a mess. We need to find someone who knew the place in order to figure out specifically what was taken.
Hey, guys.
you hear that?
footsteps upstairs? You think they heard something?
I think the person downstairs did.
gosh, I've been in this building 27 years.
now, the worst incident we ever had was when Benjamin Headley up in 402
found out his wife was sleeping with the cleaner guy and shot him in the groin.
ma'am, when did you hear the screaming? Oh, it was late.
it was around, uh, 3: 30.
well, then you must have heard the unsub, because according to the me, Joe died around 2: 45.
the wh-what? What? Our suspect, ma'am.
what exactly was the person yelling?
he said, "I was just a kid.
I was a kid then. I don't want to kill anymore.
was anybody talking back to him?
I assumed he was yelling into the phone or something.
you know, maybe he was having a conversation with his hallucination.
was he hearing voices? We're not really sure, ma'am.
you've been a really big help, Mrs. Donolly. Thank you very much.
if you have any more questions for me, you know where to find me.
Bye.
PCP hallucinations are terrifying.
he wouldn't want to talk to them.
well, hallucinations from mental illnesses are not violent.
you know, he's in his 20s and was acting paranoid in the supermarket.
he sounds like a paranoid schizophrenic to me.
the disease does manifest itself at this age.
what if the people he's seeing are blaming him for something.
or worse. The voices in his head could be telling him to kill.
baby, it's not gonna work. L-l-leave me alone!
no, no, that is not gonna cut it.
get out!
Oh, we're never gonna leave. Ha ha!
you should have never hurt us. I don't know nothin' about that.
Oh, pick up.
Ben, she's not gonna help, buddy.
she can help.
let me be!
Ben, is... is that you?
Yeah, it's m-me, mama.
are you upset?
you... you sound upset, Ben.
I... I need your help.
what can mommy do to help?
and are you stuttering again? Mama, they're back.
have you taken the medication? No, it doesn't work.
I'm getting sick of these calls, Ben.
are you praying, Ben?
maybe I should just kill myself.
Ben, you need to go to church like I told you.
the church helped you the last time with this problem.
she's lying, Ben. That's what mothers do.
you stop it.
mama, I need help now.
then find a yellow pages and find a church nearby.
I am sick of these calls and I am sick of listening to you!
no, mama, please don't hang up.
we believe our unsub is a white male paranoid schizophrenic who suffers from hallucinations.
since schizophrenic breaks usually occur in your early 20s, we believe he's around this age and that he lives nearby.
we think this unsub is hypervigilant, and in this condition, he's unable to travel very far from his home.
he kills at night and is extremely violent.
during the day, he's most likely a loner.
someone in this state probably can't keep a job.
we believe something happened to our unsub in his childhood.
childhood voices are telling him to kill, or he's misinterpreting them as doing so.
our unsub has probably been coping until now, but a recent stressor brought him back to that childhood incident\Nand is causing him to act out.
our unsub spends his days wandering, trying to fight the desire to kill, yet he feels trapped by his hallucinations.
no matter what he does or tries to do, the hallucination's power is greater than his own.
because of his limited social circle as a child, it is our belief that the incident involved close friends or family.
now, once we figure out what happened when he was a kid and the stressor that recently triggered a relapse, we'll be that much closer to narrowing down the killer's identity.
mama said, "Ben, they're not there.
eyes...
we need you all to start searching in this area.
based on previous kills, we know that he strikes at night and will not retreat until we find him.
hello.
may I help you?
I n-need... need someone to talk to.
let me finish lighting these candles.
what seems to be the problem, sir?
I've been seeing things.
they're b-b-blaming me for the fire.
who, son? What fire?
an eye for an eye?
I n-need you to get rid of them.
what would you like me to do, son?
when I was 10, the church, they helped me.
what did they do for you?
they prayed for me.
gather 'round, all.
God, help this child.
release his demons.
they called my name.
they told me I'd be freed.
they p-poured water on my head.
they performed an exorcism on you.
I need you to do it again.
what you have is a medical problem, not a spiritual one.
I've been to a doctor.
churches don't perform exorcisms anymore.
I need you to make an exception. I'm sorry, but I don't do...
son! I need help! I need help! Son. Son!
son, calm down.
you know, that profile kind of makes it sound like schizophrenia leads to serial killing.
that's not what we said at all, Reid.\NYou know, my mom has schizophrenia.
there are many different types. I know that.
catatonic, disorganized...
just because someone suffers from inability to organize their thoughts or they can't bathe or dress themselves, it doesn't mean they'd stab someone in the chest 30 times postmortem.
Reid, what's really going on?
our unsub's hallucinations aren't fractured like a typical schizophrenic.
they're vivid and clear, leading me to believe that we're missing an important variable.
rather than making crazy conjectures,
I think we should be trying to figure out what it is.
OK, listen to me.
I know this is a scary age for you.
it's when schizophrenic breaks happen.
have you talked to anybody about this?
have you seen a doctor?
they all say I'm fine. Then why don't you believe them?
because predicting one's chances of developing a genetic condition are like finding a penny in an ocean.
I have terrible headaches. I can't sleep at night.
I can't focus on our cases.
I only read 5 books last week.
come on, kid, you gotta cut yourself some slack.
you're also depressed about Prentiss, and I get it... we all are.
Reid, I miss her every day.\NBut if your mind was splitting, do you really think you'd be able to figure out that this team is missing a variable?
I'm just speculating that we are.
you need to prove it.
OK, then you do that.
the moment you are wandering around the streets aimlessly, that's when I'll be concerned about you.
come on, pretty boy. Let's get to work.
had you not used that lighter, Ben, none of this would have happened.
Ben, I said wait up!
sir, don't let 'em on, please.
don't let 'em on.
you can't run, Ben.
no, they're lying.
go sit down, kid.
because of HPPA laws, I can't get information on 20-something-year-olds who've had schizophrenic breaks.
then check police records. Maybe he's been arrested.
Oh, I should have thought of that. Blame the fumes. Ok.
Hey, 6 kids have been locked up in the last month within a 40-mile radius.
any of them for theft?
Um...Mugging, lewd behavior, car theft.
all right, go through personal information.
maybe they've had run-ins with the law when they were younger.\NYes, sir, I am on that.
you know, at the grocery store where Karen Heywood was shopping the night she was murdered, the Clark said the unsub was buying water and a lot of salt.
saltwater could be used to torture his victims.\NWell, there's no evidence of that.
it could also be used to remove victims' blood from clothing.
think about this, though. The visions that schizophrenics have can be interpreted as demons.
what do some people do when they think they have demons inside of them?
they could get an exorcism. Holy water is used in exorcisms.
what about the salt?\NSalt is used in exorcisms and a variety of religious healings.
what are you looking for?
the number of churches in the comfort zone. 3.
all right, let's see if any of them keep their doors open late.
I'm... mm...
I'm n-not hurting an old lady.
come on, if you do it, it'll help things.
it's always temporary with you. I need it to work forever.
pretend it's your mom, the mother who's sick of listening to you.
d-do you promise that you'll go away this time?
have we ever lied to you, Ben?
he came here in duress about...2 hours ago. What did he say?
he said...He said voices were blaming him for a fire, and he needed me to get rid of them.
you're right. He thinks he's haunted.
did he ask you for an exorcism?
Yes. He claimed his mother had taken him to get one when he was young.
and what did you tell him? I couldn't do it.
throughout history, people have confused possession with mental illness. Some still do.
nowadays, most churches turn people like him over to medical professionals.
I'm assuming he didn't take your rejection well. He was very angry.
but he didn't attack you? He didn't threaten you in any way?
he's probably gotten help from the church before.
was there anything else about his behavior that you found odd?
like something he maybe said or did?
no. I told you everything. Oh, there is one thing.
he had a stutter.
OK, well, let me know what you find, Garcia.
Psychogenetic stuttering begins in the area of the brain that controls thoughts and reasoning.
it's most commonly associated with mental illness.
I checked with the supermarket guy\Nand the lady at the building, but neither one of them heard stuttering. Which means it's either caused by the schizophrenia medication or maybe it's situational.
well, the presence of it along with the fire information should help Garcia narrow down her list.
this victim's a lot older than his other ones, Morgan.
she must represent something to him.
maybe his mother who had him exorcised.
now that he can't get one, he's taking his anger out on a surrogate.
did the EMTs try to save her?
no. Why?
there's a body imprint next to her.
why would the unsub lie down next to a person he's just killed?
he slept here.
look at the number of stab wounds.
there's gotta be over 50 of them.
71
do you know how physically exhausting it would be to stab someone 71 times?
it's hard enough to stab someone 10 times, but 71... he'd be completely worn out.
he's accelerated wound counts, which means he does it intentionally.
but why?
wait, that's it. If you add the increased\Nnumber of stab wounds and the fact that he slept here to the vivid hallucinations and the unexplainable onset of stuttering, you get the missing variable. This guy's an insomniac.
just as adrenaline makes a person love the feeling of killing, once it leaves the body it makes them tired.\NHe does this all to sleep?
the insomnia is what makes the hallucinations so clear, and sleep is the only release that he has from them.
you said you'd leave.\NStop complaining. You slept.
that not how I want to do it!
but it worked. You look refreshed and your stutter's gone.
move!
you're not gonna try the pills. They're a waste.
then maybe he'll go to the clinic. Yeah, maybe I will!
get the knife and let's go. I want to sleep!
you sassing me, boy? Ben, just get the knife.
I'm not killing anymore! Why are you making this so difficult?
get off! Get the knife and let's go.
OK, here we go. I looked at that list of schizophrenics that have been recently arrested in that 40-mile radius.
I cross-checked it with ones that have gone to local pharmacies to get schizophrenia medication like thorazine or prolixin.
any of them have prescriptions filled for sleeping medication as well?
Yes, one.
Ben foster, he has a prescription for thorazine and ambien.
it's likely he uses the money from the stolen items to buy the pills.
what's his background, baby girl?
he moved to Portland 3 years ago.
a month ago he was in an apartment fire, after which he got a sleeping pill medication because his insomnia began again.
Oh, my. When he was 10, he was questioned during an investigation about a fire that killed 3 people.
it could be part of the homicidal triad.
I'm looking at the police report right now.
it turns out 2 months before, his mom had a local minister perform an exorcism on him, and the 3 people who were killed in the fire helped perform that exorcism.
was Ben charged? No. He was acquitted in juvie court.
you got an address?
uh, 2627 Halden way.
what, you thought we had left? Wishful thinking, huh, Ben?
it's gonna be all right. It's ok.
what's up?
I think they're after us. Come on!
come on, Ben. We don't want to get caught.
no, no, I didn't do anything.\NIf you stay here, they're gonna get you.
you don't want that, do you? I'm not killing anyone!
that's not the point. You're gonna - go to jail if you don't leave. - Ben. Ben.
let's go.
he's out back!
up you go!
Seaver, let's go!
go.
come on, man, we gotta hide.
in here! Whoo!
Hotch, we lost him.
we're gonna check the back alley. Come on.
Hey, mom, is that you?
come here. I'm not gonna hurt you two, all right? Listen, I need you to shut the curtains.
Yes. Can you do that? Can you do that for me?
come on. Come on.
OK.
do it.
OK.
OK. Go...
go help her. Go help her.
get that one.
help him.
hurry up!
I think we've got something at 2218.
come on, g-get this one.
here, here. It's ok.
what do you want to do now? I just want to sleep.
no, you can't sleep. You promised!
we never promised you that.
you can't keep doing this. We just did, Ben.
who is he talking to?
take the little kid out first. I'm not hurting the kid.
fine, then. Take the girl. She's useless.
make his stop, please.
there's no one there. They're right there!
Ben, drop the knife.
don't listen to him, Ben.
shoot me.
Ben, we're not gonna shoot you, but we do need you to put down that knife, ok?
all right, where are the other people in this room, Ben?
right there. You see him?
right here?
were they there for the exorcism?
I didn't kill them, though. I didn't do it.
liar. And I'm not lying!
Ben, they're dead and they can't hurt you anymore.
they can't?
no, Ben. Your mind is playing tricks on you.
once you get help, it'll all stop. We're never gonna stop, Ben.
Yes, you are. Not until we're done with you.
Yeah, ok.
all right, I killed you. I set the fire.
Ah, it's about time. Ben!
Ben, listen to us. It's ok.
we're gonna get you a doctor's help. I promise you that.
no. The...
the only way that you can help me is if you do it... if you kill me.
Ben, that's not true. Listen, the only way we can help you is if you take that knife and you stab me in the neck with it.
are you sure that'll work?
Oh, I'm absolutely sure of it. Put that knife down, ok?
take that knife, jam me in the neck with it, and all your problems will go away, ok?
OK.
it's ok. Get going.
OK.
we need an ambulance.
siddhartha Buddha said, "it is not his enemy or foe that lures him into evil ways.
why are you still up?
I've been looking over Ben's file.
turns out he'd been seeing evil imaginary friends ever since he was a child.
Ben was always a killer. You think he had schizophrenia?
he may have suffered from some mental disease, but schizophrenia usually presents itself\Nin your late teens or early 20s.
Ben did kill those people in that church fire, which is part of the homicidal triad.
and his mother thought an exorcism would get rid of the demons.
the only way you stop a killer is to catch him, seaver.
you know, I always viewed serial killers as monsters.
but Ben's remorse seemed real.
and that's why I can't sleep.
I... I can't get him out of my mind.
does it ever go away?
luckily it does.
try to get some rest.
the electroshock therapy worked.
you shouldn't hear the voices now.
how do you feel?
good. Good.
that's good, Ben.
wh-what are you doing here?
they said you'd go away.
you don't want that, do you, Ben?
I-it's not up to me.
they said I was sick, that they'd fix me.
no. Our spirits have been with you your whole life, Ben.
no. You've been with me since the church fire.
you sure about that, Ben?
guess who I went to second base with.
who, Cy? - Lyla Smith.
bull! Get back here! DURANT, OKLAHOMA, 1986
why don't you believe me?
because you lie!
I grew up normal, in a normal house, the size of a castle.
I played sports...
sang in the choir, for the President of the United States...
and celebrated my birthdays with 4-story cakes, flown straight from Paris.
my brother and I played kickball over there.
and--and here is where we would hide from the police after stealing magic potions from the toy store.
I don't know why they wouldn't believe me when I told them we were gonna make things with it.
I still build things now.
I--I took apart a 1961 DeSoto and built a generator from scratch.
it's so powerful, it could light a Springsteen concert.
but for now, it just lights my room.
what are you-- what are you doing?
I don't understand.
I'll do anything. Please, don't hurt me.
why would I hurt you?
no, no, no, no, no, no!
so you finished the course?
Mm-hmm. And completed my case rotation.
Hotch says he's never seen a rookie profiler analyze and write up cases as well as you.
he said that?
Yeah. Well, after all the cases you presented over the years, I'm not surprised.
Hey, where have you been? I wanted to do brunch this weekend.
I had to deal with some stuff with my mom.
have you seen Garcia? Uh, she's with Rossi.
he hates me.
he was just busy.
let it go.
OK, you can be honest. I can take it.
OK. I prefer my pasta, and the pancetta was a little weird. Oh. That's 'cause it's tofu.
tofu? I give you my recipe and you do an improv?
no, no, I followed it down to the micron, aside from the pig.
look, master of all things Italian,
I am having a Fellini festival at my house this weekend and I must serve the beautiful food of his country.
maybe you should show a Disney film and stick with burgers.
you know, Rossi, you could always give Penelope a cooking lesson.
Oh, my gosh, that would be amazing.
that would be like
that would be like the Iron Chef meets the BAU.
and we could do it at your house. I don't have a house,
I have a mansion. All right, let's get started.
all right.
you are jetting to Durant, Oklahoma, because in the last 3 days, two women have been found dead after being sexually tortured and then blinded with a sulfuric acid solution.
Abby Elcott is our first victim. 19-year-old art student.
she was headed to campus for an advanced drawing class.
she'd been missing for two days.
same goes for our second victim, Beth Westerly, 17.
she had just finished her coffee shop shift and was on her way to a bar method class.
both low-risk victims.
and physically similar.
how close are the two abduction sites?
5 miles apart at bus stops.
Abby's cell was found near one, Beth's scarf near the other.
where are the dump sites? One in an alley, the other in a field.
so he stapled their eyes open, then he blinded them.
it's about power and control.
maybe he didn't want them to watch while he hurt them.
or it could be about shame.
perhaps the unsub is disfigured himself.
blinding the victims leaves them helpless, lost, totally dependent.
it may be a manifestation of how he sees himself in this world.
it is a form of enucleation, just without the scalpel.
his face is the last they see before darkness.
Garcia, come up with a list of jobs that would give the unsub access to sulfuric acid.
the rest of us, wheels up in 30 minutes.
and this is where my brother lives now.
there you are, Cy.
I got you clothes.
bought you some shampoo and toothpaste.
see? We're the perfect American story.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ok. Turn that thing off, come on in.
come on.
every story has a beginning.
but the part I like best is the end.
if it is a miracle, " any sort of evidence will answer ."
but if it is a fact, proof is necessary.
mark Twain. Victimology is very similar.
blond-haired, blue-eyed teenage girls.
we believe they were each abducted near public transportation stops.
when was this photo taken?
Beth was caught on a bank surveillance camera 3 hours before she disappeared.
that's a recent photo of Abby.
so she wasn't found in the same clothes she was abducted in.
maybe he changed them because hers were burned by the sulfuric acid.
it's possible. Sulfuric acid can turn human flesh into soap.
Garcia, any recent similar cases in the surrounding area?
actually, yes. Two months ago a prostitute and a runaway were both found raped and killed and they had stab wounds to their eyes.
so maybe he practiced on high-risk victims first.
and then advanced to chemical enucleation.
isn't that a rare paraphilia?
well, the chemical part is. It would exacerbate the pain.
like Ed Kemper, he's probably practicing on surrogates before going after the real object of his rage.
Dave, you and I will talk to the parents.
morgan and Prentiss, go to the disposal sites.
JJ, you and Reid to the abduction sites.
so Beth got off the bus here and headed northwest toward class.
it's amazing no one witnessed her abduction.
Emily was buried 6 feet under and wound up in Paris, so I guess anything's possible, right?
so that is what this is about.
maybe our unsub's a little bit like Bundy.
he feigns injury in order to get her to help him.
look, Spence, if you want to talk about this-- maybe he tried other tactics, like, "Wow, you're really pretty.You should be a model. I can take your photo."
I'll take that as a no. Either one would disarm her.
charm is quite the killer.
so are tears. Whatever his ruse was, the unsub mostly likely used it to get her into his vehicle.
well, if Abby was last seen at a bus stop a few miles away, then he definitely has a means of transportation.
hopefully the disposal site will tell us more.
so what do you have, Detective Bonner?
Beth's body was found over there.
you smell the urine?
I thought that was air freshener.
there's drugstore food everywhere. It's a homeless corridor.
Abby was found in a shantytown as well.
so, our unsub hunts and travels through the areas unnoticed, blending in with his surroundings.
this guy's either homeless or appears to be.
he most likely has a car, to get them from the abduction site to here.
just because you're homeless doesn't mean you're carless.
it could explain why he chose high-risk victims at first.
they were all around him.
he had her for two days?
I can't even imagine what she went through.
why did he blind her?
that's what we're trying to figure out.
I know this is difficult, but I need you to look at the clothes that Abby was wearing when we found her.
do you recognize them?
do you find anything odd about Beth's clothing?
they're not Abby's.
you sure? I saw her that morning.
she had on a brown and pink sweater.
Beth wouldn't wear denim shorts.
they aren't her style.
you're sure?
in addition to the blinding, taking their clothes further robs them of their identity.
he's either keeping their garments as souvenirs or re-dressing the victims as a forensic countermeasure.
dressing them in these outfits could be part of the fantasy.
where do homeless people get their clothes?
churches, thrift stores. We need to rule everything out.
Whooo! I'm a plane! I'm a plane!
you are now entering Dallas International Airport.
please hold on to your flotation device and fasten your seatbelts!
Cy, your stuff is right there.
Oh, minty fresh. I like minty fresh.
we keep buying you toothbrushes, but you clearly aren't using them.
instead of crashing here every now and again, why don't you just move in?
I like to be free.
last night I had a date with two hot twins.
is that so? Why don't you believe me?
remember when he said he dated Cyndi Lauper in high school?
I did, I did, I did!
how many times do I have to tell you? A million, 'cause you always lie.
Hey, guys. Hi. Hey, Uncle Cy.
Tammy, how was practice? I hit two home runs.
Hey, Mom, what's the deal with my dress?
on your bed.
Really?
Where's she going?
homecoming's tomorrow night.
I loved homecoming.
well, we'll be taking pictures before she leaves. Why don't you stop by?
Oh, and maybe I could tape it.
no, that's ok, Cy. You don't have to.
why not? It'll be fun.
no, no, no. What would be fun would be if you and I take a break.
I can see the Doctor's working.
counseling's worth every penny.
excuse me.
do you know where Church Street is?
uh, you're on Church Street.
Uh-huh. I am?
See...you're standing right here.
just walk. Shh, shh. Just walk. Come on.
this way. Come on.
Reid and JJ went to the local thrift shop and found Abby's clothes. So he sold them.
or traded them for the eighties clothing.
the sales clerk said the clothes in the crime scene photos were of that time period, and he confirmed that they were purchased from his store.
so if he's getting rid of his souvenirs. What's he using to remember his victims?
and why is he fixated on this era?
what do you got?
the brutality the victims experienced was immense.
multiple stab wounds to the neck and chest, plus wounds to the genital.
frustration and overkill.
the same chemical damage on the skin is also around her nostrils.
he poured the sulfuric acid there as well.
and that would destroy their sense of smell, yes?
Absolutely. He didn't do that to the first victim.
no, he's escalating.
and blinding isn't his only signature.
no, he's trying to take away their senses.
I like when women scream.
it reminds me of the roller coaster.
I like roller coasters.
especially in the summertime.
somebody please help me!
somebody!
what? You don't like the way I taste?!
No!
well, I can help you with that.
please, please...
somebody help me!
somebody please help me!
no, no. No...
again he's disposing in an area frequented by homeless people.
it's equidistant to the last two dump sites.
he burned her tongue with the chemical this time.
so he removed her ability to taste. Why would he do that?
historically this kind of torture was used to prevent someone from revealing a secret.
maybe she offended him. - I wonder what that's like.
her lips are extremely chapped.
she was probably forced to repeatedly participate in some sort of kissing fantasy.
and when things go awry, he takes the offending sense away.
he tortured her in these clothes, which means the eighties are essential to his delusion.
maybe that's when this rejection occurred and he held on to the clothes all these years.
and now he's attacking girls who remind him of women from that time.
he's fixated on her type and remakes them fit his fantasy.
but why start now? Something probably triggered it, and instead of dealing with it, he's acting out.
we believe the unsub or unknown subject that we're looking for is a white male in his 40s.
this is someone who's reacting to rejection by a woman when he was teenager in the 1980s.
he's punishing his victims for their reactions to him by taking away their senses with sulfuric acid.
we believe our unsub could possibly work part-time as a janitor or a mechanic, which would give him access to this chemical.
and after studying the disposal sites, we think it's likely that he is homeless.
now, how do we typically react toward the homeless?
we judge them by their looks and smells.
it's that same negative reaction we believe that a woman had toward the unsub at some point in the eighties.
the unsub's fixation on this woman is now all-consuming.
it's caused him to develop obsessive love disorder.
he most likely has tunnel vision and believes that she holds the key to his happiness.
he will stalk her in an attempt to win her back.
he will do whatever it takes to be near his love interest.
but her rejection will spiral him into a depression.
which would lead to rape and murder of the surrogates who represent her.
and it's only a matter of time before this rage and anger causes the unsub to go after her directly.
let's go, let's fight, let's win tonight!
let's go, let's fight, let's win tonight!
you've got to be kidding!
give me a break, Cy.
leave me alone, Matt!
Hello!
Spence. Look, we gotta talk about this.
I don't want to talk about it.
I get it, ok? You're disappointed with the way we handled Emily.
listen, I have a lot going on, all right?
what? You know what I think it is?
you're mad that Hotch and I controlled our micro-expressions at the hospital and you weren't able to detect our deception.
you think it's about my profiling skills?
Jennifer, listen, the only reason you were able to manage my perceptions is because I trusted you. I came to your house for 10 weeks in a row crying over losing a friend, and not once did you have the decency to tell me the truth.
I couldn't. You couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
no, I couldn't.
what if I started taking Dilaudid again? Would you have let me?
you didn't.
Yeah, but I thought about it.
I'm sorry.
it's too late, all right?
Oh, Cy, why don't you just crash here?
I may for a bit. You know, if mom and dad were alive, they'd make you.
you ought to try and have a nice life. I have a nice life.
when things get bad, I go out on this ship made of clay.
of clay, Cy?
last night I took another girl out on it.
yeah? When can we meet her?
never.
she's dead to me.
what do you think?
I lightened my hair in your honor Mom.
Oh, my, you're beautiful!
Where's the camera?
you look just like your mom did in high school.
that's 'cause I'm wearing the same dress. Mom cut it shorter.
so, can I stay out till 2: 00?
nice try. You can go to the dance and then the party at the motel, but Debbie's mom's picking you up at midnight.
OK. - Ok.
have fun.
thank you.
it would have had to have been a woman very close to the unsub to make him react this way.
then why go after surrogates?
I don't think we're dealing with a typical homeless person.
he's good with chemicals, owns a car.
I think the only mistake in our profile was assuming there was something wrong with his physical composition, reducing him to some sort of stereotype.
you think it's only his mental state?
I think this guy might be smart enough to use his disability to his advantage so he comes across as harmless.
then when he's alone and the victim rejects him, he goes off.
what if he doesn't live on the street? What if he's in a halfway house?
Garcia, I need a list of halfway houses and mental health centers in the unsub's comfort zone.
OK. 5 are being sent to your phones.
which of those were around in the eighties, Garcia?
there are two in your area.
morgan and Prentiss, take the first. Dave and I will take the second.
what about us?
stay here and check ViCAP for similar M. O.s and signatures.
if you want to be mad at someone, be mad at me.
I can't. I didn't come to your house crying for 10 weeks.
I've worked here over 15 years. There are many people who fit that description.
this guy would be mobile, probably early 40s.
well, if he's got a car, then he's transitioned out in the last few years.
state budget cuts. All right, we'll need a list of those names.
it ain't gonna be small.
Hey, Morgan.
what do I do about Reid?
Emily, there's a lot about you being back that's unresolved.
are you pissed at me, too?
come on, now.
how can I be? You're here.
thank you.
because I know what you went through.
grief counseling. You carried my coffin.
Yeah, I sure did. What was in that thing, anyway?
I don't know. Here you go.
thank you very much.
look, just give Reid some time.
he'll be fine.
Thanks.
Yeah, Hotch, it's me, Morgan. Listen, 19 people entered this house in the eighties who were let out in the last 5 years. We got 11 from the one we visited.
send your names to Garcia. Have her cross-check them against jobs that use sulfuric acid.
all right. We'll start reaching out to the extended families.
OK.
how's Reid? He's angry and frustrated.
I'm surprised everybody isn't.
some of us had an inkling.
what? I'm good at what I do.
so, are you gonna get psychological counseling for the team or handle it internally?
no, I think that if we all just got together, maybe a cooking lesson and at the home of one of one of our founders.
Oh, no, not you, too.
it could boost morale. Is this an order?
no, it's just a-- it's a very tempered suggestion.
tempered suggestion.
Hey, you all right?
Yeah. Thanks, Debbie. I just...
I just need a minute.
uncle Cy? What are you doing here?
I--I was just going to buy some beer.
you ok? No.
maybe I should take you home.
I don't want to get in trouble with mom and dad.
you won't.
I'll take care of you.
so we interviewed the 19 people released from the group home.
none of them fit the profile.
Dave's still trying to locate the families.
Tammy Bradstone's parents just filed a report.
their daughter didn't return from homecoming last night.
her face is similar to our 3 vics. She's about the same age.
well, the after party where she was last seen was smack in the comfort zone.
where are her parents now?
they're at the house. We're bringing her friends in for questioning.
you head over there. We'll start the interviews here.
I see on the news on the TV, people question, they question why people do this.
it's the same reason people do anything.
cause they feel like it. They like the way it feels.
when I was kid, my dog Poppy running across the grass, when I hit her, I liked that feeling.
that has not changed.
somebody help me! Help!
uncle Cy?
what's happening?
what did you do to me?
so kids spill out of the motel toward the cars.
if Tammy walked this way, how could she disappear without anyone seeing her?
someone would have heard her scream. That's if she screamed.
unlike the last 3 abduction sites, this one is nowhere near public transportation.
maybe she knew the unsub. Or thought she did.
what if--what if Tammy was the target all along?
that would explain the change in the M. O.
so whoever did this knew she was coming here.
Hey, baby girl, I need you to work that magic for me. Anything, my sweetest.
I just opened up Tammy Bradstone's computer.
I want you to check her emails, web searches, and anyone she may have Skyped.
OK, typing at the speed of thought.
Thanks, mama.
are you gonna find my sister?
we're gonna try, little man.
listen, uh, did your sister dye her hair recently?
Yeah. To look nice for the homecoming dance.
she was even gonna wear the same dress my mom did.
are you sure that Tammy hasn't been behaving differently lately?
she's 16, so she's pretty closed off.
your daughter seems to cherish hanging out in groups, so there's no way she would run off with someone unless she knew them.
what about her computer? Nothing out of the ordinary, and Hotch cleared the boyfriend.
do you know anyone who is transient or mentally ill?
uh, yeah, my brother.
he didn't get enough oxygen to his brain when he was born.
what's his name?
cy Bradstone. On the halfway house list, all I got was a Ben Bradstone.
Oh, no, yeah, that's his real name. Cy is the name he made up.
where does he live?
he crashes here from time to time, but he's basically homeless.
his frontal lobe damage is one of the indicators of serial killers. Cy isn't a serial killer.
he wouldn't hurt anybody, especially not my daughter.
come on.
come on!
shh, shh. Just a little bit further.
I want to tell you a story.
has Cy ever acted inappropriately toward Tammy?
no. I wouldn't let him in here if he had.
OK, so he sleeps here sometimes, and his head is on this side.
that puts the TV out of his sight.
since when is that a crime?
well, it just gives him a full view of the kitchen.
does Tammy cook for him? No. Lyla does.
ma'am, what's your relationship with Cy?
I've known him since 10th grade.
that was 1985.
he makes you uncomfortable, doesn't he?
did you have blond hair in high school?
Yes. What are you getting at?
sir, your daughter just dyed her hair blond.
you allowed her to wear your dress.
I'm just thinking it may have triggered something for Cy.
what happened with you and Cy that made him so angry?
honey, what is it?
when I was 16, my friends and I went to a party after homecoming.
everyone had been drinking.
damn. I'm seeing stars.
let's play spin the bottle.
when it was your mom's turn, she spun it and it landed on me.
you should have seen her face.
she lit up like-- like a lite brite.
I didn't know what to do.
my friends laughed, but I didn't want to be mean, so I...
went in the closet with him.
and what happened next?
I let him feel me up.
how did he behave after that?
he started following me around at school.
then one day he overheard me tell a friend how gross I thought he was.
how he talked, how he smelled? Why didn't you tell me this?
I was 16.
we had just started dating.
does Cy know about your recent marital problems?
I told him a couple months ago.
and then he probably started making advances towards you, which you had to reject.
that's what triggered the killings.
I did this?
no. No, ma'am. The events did.
does Cy have a part-time job? Yeah, he works at a couple garages.
one on Drake, the other on Fourth.
that explains the sulfuric acid.
we'll need those addresses.
OK. Excuse me.
OK, so, as long as Tammy doesn't do anything to antagonize him, we may have a chance.
Oh, my God.
it's you!
you're the one that my mom told me about.
Uh-huh. Yes.
you took advantage of her when she was drunk at a party.
no, that's--that's not true.
Yes.
that's probably why she won't touch you now.
that's why she won't touch me?
Yeah. Because you forced yourself on her.
you shouldn't have done that, Tammy.
you should have kept your mouth shut!
you won't get away with this, Uncle Cy.
they'll find you.
they can't find me, Tammy.
they're not looking for me.
when Cy comes to the house, he gets out of the car and he goes to the door.
Yeah.
how do you know he's here?
I can hear his truck.
so then you head to the front door.
Yes.
there you are, Cy.
when you open it, what do you smell?
he smells musty, like he needs to take a shower.
are you sure that's all you smell?
I smell chemicals.
he smells like chemicals.
what does he do next?
he crushes a cup, and-- and he puts it in his bag.
Where's it from? Is there a name on the cup?
it's a soda from a coffee shop.
the Way Station. It's down the street.
OK. He probably stops there every time he comes here.
what days would those be?
monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Sometimes Saturday.
which means he'd be coming today.
I need you to leave a message for him there.
I'm going to go get us something to eat.
don't worry, Tammy.
there are other sports to play.
any luck? - He hasn't been to either of the mechanics' shops in the past two months.
but the one on Fourth said a bunch of car batteries had gone missing.
wait
yeah?
Morgan, it's from a pay phone near a coffee shop.
it's him.
OK, go ahead. Just like we talked about.
Hello? Hi, it's Cy.
Paulie said you were looking for me.
Lyla, what's wrong, Lyla?
Matt got arrested.
what? Lyla, what are you talking about?
they think that he hurt Tammy.
Oh, God, Cy.
I need you.
Shh. Don't--don't cry. Lyla, don't--don't cry.
everything's gonna be all right.
I just--I--I need you to, uh , come over here and
I need you to talk. I need you to hold me.
you--you do?
Yes. I
hurry. I have no one else to turn to.
I'll be there, Lyla. I'll be there.
he's coming.
you and Prentiss stay with them. Morgan and I will get the front.
it's gonna be ok.
Shh. It's gonna be ok.
cy Bradstone! FBI! Put your hands where I can see them!
let me see your hands! On your knees, now!
how could you do this to me? Get up.
how could you do this to me?!
stop moving. Stop it!
we need to know where Tammy is, Cy.
we've looked in your car. There's no sign of her.
we know this isn't about Tammy.
this is about your love for Lyla.
Lie-la!
you and Lyla had a pretty good secret all these years.
how'd she get you to shut up about it?
one time. That's all I needed.
is that where you, uh, did it, Cy?
is that the same place you took Tammy?
we know when you saw her in that dress, it made you think of Lyla.
Tammy's not the one you want to hurt, Cy.
Lyla's the one that should be punished.
she's the one who made you feel like a freak.
a reject, a weirdo.
tell us where Tammy is, Cy, and we can be done.
done?
finished.
finished?
well, I can--I can do that.
under one condition.
now, where's Tammy, Cy?
what did you do with my daughter?
Lyla was an angel.
like--like a prize in the Crackerjack box.
when she would come into the room, my heart would race.
when I saw Tammy in that dress, it took me back there.
Cy, just tell me where she is.
I took her. We did things.
everything was going good un-until she said those words.
what did she say, Cy?
she said...
she said the reason her mother always backed up when I came over was because she didn't want to feel me touching her.
so guess what I did, Matt. You guess!
what did you do, Cy?
I made it so she couldn't feel either.
she screamed so loud.
but no one could hear her.
where do you have her?
the same place I told him about my love.
guess who I went to second base with.
who, Cy? Lyla Smith. Bull!
get back here. Why don't you believe me?
because you lie!
you never told me that. Yes, I did, yes, I did, yes, I did!
but you thought I was lying and then you married my girl!
so this is what you do, Cy? Why didn't you just hurt me?
I take away your senses, Matt.
the last one is hearing.
and if I take that, you wouldn't be able to listen to what I did to her.
you son of a bitch! You taped-- you taped my daughter?!
you son of a bitch! - You son of a bitch!
you son of a bitch! Ha ha ha ha!
clear!
she's got a pulse. I need a medic in here!
Oh, jeez.
Scott Adams wrote, "Nothing inspires forgiveness quite like revenge.
so, the surgeon said he believes he can restore feeling to Tammy's hands.
good. We got there in time.
I heard Mr. Bradstone wants to watch the tape.
people have an innate curiosity to see things in order to confirm them.
Oh, that explains why I'm going to Rossi's tomorrow night.
I want to see if he really can cook.
you coming?
I don't know. I'm not so sure I can make it.
look, Reid, I know you're mad at us because we didn't tell you what really happened, and I understand that.
but I promise you, we had no choice.
you mourned the loss of a friend.
I mourned the loss of 6.
this whole thing gave me an ulcer.
please don't give me another one.
are you gonna go to Rossi's tomorrow?
we'll see.
now, Matt, you might not want to watch this.
but this is what I'm going to do to your daughter.
but what I did with your wife, now, that's a tape you should see.
No! Stop!
Aah! Stop!
cooking is the most sensual art form.
and these are my paints.
so your hands must be brushes. Don't interrupt.
in a pot of boiling water we cook our spaghetti until it's al dente, firm to the tooth.
here you go. Everybody pass it around.
see? Feel the texture. There we go. Ok.
now...
in a large pan, we fry up our pancetta.
keeping a sharp eye that the edges are crisp.
but careful not to burn the onions. Bravo, Aaron!
we saute until translucence.
uh--I got it.
now, we mix in the eggs...
the parmesan...
the spaghett... and parsley.
you see, it's all about timing and rhythm.
and if you don't feel yourself doing it properly, please, order a pizza.
sorry I'm late. Yeah. And this is why I cook alone.
so, uh, when do we get to drink the wine? Almost there.
OK. We start at the beginning.
you eat what you cook, I'll supervise, but we're gonna do this all together, just like a family.
OK now?
now.
Salud! Mambo Italiano
all right. Whoa! I'm reaching!
didn't come out here to play games!
bus is leaving in 5 minutes.
get your gear or it stays.
you're out here 6 days, boys.
had a chance to prove yourselves.
and what have you done?
showed me you're a bunch of lazy sons of bitches.
I got your message.
good. What do you think?
it presents as mass suicide.
can you prove it? -Not without visiting the campus.
that's what I thought. -I can't make an assessment without meeting the faculty and students.
I know it.
the school is up for the Federal Tomlinson grant.
this does not bode well.
the director's a graduate of Somerville Academy, isn't he?
Yes. And he's been fighting for the government funding.
these boys killed themselves for a reason. No one should write that off.
I'm not asking you to.
Somerville Military Academy, Oceanside, Florida, 5 boys were found hanging this morning.
the bodies are at the medical examiner's now.
there's no photos?
school personnel thought they may still be alive, so they cut them out of the trees.
Jimmy Burbage, Phil Mumford, Jerry Bowden, Jack Briggs, Tucker Calhoun.
so we're walking into a contaminated crime scene.
we don't have anything solid? -"We're sorry" was carved in a tree branch nearby.
this happened on campus? -No, in the woods about an hour away.
how long were they out there?
6 days.
without supervision? -It was an outward bound mission for the upperclassmen.
what drove them to suicide?
a freshman cadet, Bailey Shelton, hung himself 2 weeks ago in his room.
identical bed sheet, hangman's knot.
who takes sheets camping? -They would if it was the plan.
could be domino effect.
the campus would have been on high alert after the first one, so the kids wait until they're alone in the woods.
they must have made some kind of pact. -And there's something else. 6 kids went on the trip.
only 5 were found.
the school officials confirm that Josh Redding is still missing.
so maybe he chickened out of the pact. -Or was never a part of it.
and the campus is completely off the grid. No Internet.
I can help with that. -Which is why you're coming with us.
Oh. - And so am I.
isn't Somerville the director's alma mater?
Yes. The academy has enjoyed a spotless reputation, so the hope is to keep the investigation in house.
I imagine there's a lot of concern for Josh. He's been in those woods almost a week.
so how's he surviving?
things do not change. We change.
Henry David Thoreau.
there's still no sign of Josh Redding.
we'll join the search. -So, the Somerville Academy was founded during World War II. It is hard-core old school.
they don't even have a website. -Socioeconomic breakdown's all over the map.
Yeah, so are the ages.
students are 12 to 18 years old, on the same campus, in the same dorms.
same personnel has worked there for a lifetime. Ron Massey has been superintendent for 30 years.
he's an alum, as is the majority of the staff there.
lieutenant Tawes has been his second in command this whole time.
these type of places have their own infrastructure. If it ain't broken, they ain't gonna fix it.
that's probably why they banned modern technology.
they didn't need it back then, they don't need it now.
aggressive motto--
to live is to conquer. -The school raises soldiers.
suicide is not part of that mantra. -Bailey Shelton was only 13 years old.
he was one of the youngest students there.
his death is probably the key to the others.
Colonel Massey, Erin Strauss.
this is the team I spoke with you about.
agent Hotchner.
this is Agent Morgan, Agent Jareau, Dr. Spencer Reid, and Penelope Garcia.
so shouldn't the flag be at half-mast?
I haven't told the boys yet.
do they know who we are? --I'll tell them when the time is right.
I've called all of the parents. They're driving from up and down the East Coast.
in fact, Josh Redding's have just arrived. -I'd like to speak with them.
they're in the chapel. - How are they?
as you'd expect. -All right, I'll get started.
cadet.
any leads on Josh?
in that terrain, he's only capable of moving a mile an hour.
puts him in a 60-mile radius.
that's 3, 600 square miles to cover.
Tawes knows those woods better than anybody.
we've got two agents meeting and we'll start the investigation here.
Where's the place with the most outlets? -Best bet is in the library.
thank you. -We'd like to start with Bailey Shelton's suicide.
do you have a copy of the medical examiner's report? -I don't.
but there was no question he hung himself.
well, the nuances can tell us a lot.
the doctor's receiving the last of the bodies now.
I expect he's got his hands full. -I'll speak to him later.
of course.
it would be helpful to us to know what Bailey's last day was like.
I'll show you. He stayed in the plebes' hall.
his father took all of his belongings after the suicide.
Josh's items are as they were.
Josh stayed with the first years? -He's the brigade commander.
Bailey's suicide hit him hard.
were all the victims friends of Bailey's?
brotherhood is the very price and condition of man's survival.
all of my boys are brothers.
there's Tucker Calhoun's parents.
excuse me.
if the boys were so vulnerable, why did they send them into the woods?
because it was time for their survival test.
we have a docket. -It's been only two weeks since the initial suicide.
you couldn't postpone this trip?
classes were canceled the day after Bailey died.
but men are lost in battle all the time.
this isn't battle, and these aren't men.
they are when they leave here.
how many suicides have you seen? - Just these.
so part of the mission was unsupervised? -For a week.
but you came back 6 days later.
standard procedure to check in if the weather's extreme.
had lightning and thunder last night.
the boys didn't have any way to communicate with you?
smoke signal.
Seriously? -Basic survival skills, ma'am.
we teach them to follow their instincts, not rely on technology.
no radio, no weapons.
well, survival courses like these often trigger a fight or flight response.
it looks like that's what happened to Josh.
who slept here?
don't know. They're all identical.
whoever was here took off. -And it's secluded.
did Josh Redding isolate himself a lot?
I suppose. -He was a loner.
and why is that? -He didn't want to be at Somerville in the first place.
why did you send Josh here?
because he was getting into a lot of trouble.
and he was always angry and...
he was being a teenager. -You were gone, Will.
all the time.
he was nearly 6 feet tall by the time he was 14.
with a bad temper, and he was punching holes in walls, and he wouldn't listen to me anymore.
he could be belligerent.
but this--this was extreme.
Why?
we had to force him.
what are you doing? Let me go! -We're helping you, Josh.
mom, dad, please, don't let them do this! -They're not gonna hurt you.
dad, please! -I was afraid he was gonna hurt himself.
or someone else if we didn't get him some help.
how was Josh taking Bailey's suicide?
we only talked once after that. -Phone calls are a privilege here.
was that difficult for Josh?
Josh has never been much of a talker, but I think he felt a real responsibility for Bailey and the other boys in the hall.
did he ever tell you why Bailey may have killed himself?
no.
Mr. Redding.
how are you gonna get my boy back here?
these beds are all 3 feet apart and there's absolutely no privacy.
how did Bailey hang himself without anybody noticing?
apparently he did it in here.
he used Josh's room?
according to Massey, Josh offered Bailey a lot of support.
he told you that? -Yes, when we spoke.
is that a problem?
is there anything else he mentioned?
the boys come in here just to sleep. It's why it's so minimal.
Strauss, what, are you on the board or something?
I just saw the campus same as you. It's hardly a prison.
these kids are told what to wear, what to say, and when to eat.
this goes against the very nature of these boys.
they're all looking for some type of control in their lives, and this place strips them of that.
and suicide is the ultimate power?
isn't it?
well, at least the boys felt enough remorse to write "we're sorry."
that doesn't trump taking your own life.
what is it?
but I guess I can buy that the other kids couldn't hear Bailey hang himself.
Josh was laying right here.
I've never seen a mass suicide apology.
maybe they knew it would help their parents.
could be confessing other sins.
who was in this tree? -Tucker Calhoun.
good cadet.
looks like Josh has doubled back a few times.
but the dogs can't find him.
is he familiar with these woods? -All first years come here for a mission.
Josh tried to run away back then but didn't get far.
none of them do.
but after 3 more years of training...
he didn't weigh himself down with supplies.
smart.
we taught him well.
Colonel, it's been 6 days since the suicides.
why hasn't Josh come back to campus? -He's got trust issues.
I thought he was doing well. -Too smart for his own good.
the most dangerous kind.
dangerous to whom?
himself. Boys like Josh reject the lessons of men.
his generation has little respect for their elders.
does that include you? -We've been working on it.
all the first years start in the laundry room.
it teaches them responsibility.
Ten-hut!
Bailey finished his rotation and walked back to his bunk.
so he was still here for bed check? -It wasn't the first time.
was he punished for being late?
if you're suggesting that Bailey killed himself because of a talking to, that's absurd.
that could depend on what you said.
he understood I was disappointed.
were the victims' bunks made before they went into the woods?
each and every morning.
so where did they get the sheets to hang themselves?
carry on.
come on, baby. Come on.
Boo! Jeez, you scared me.
I thought you were a ghost.
you know, older buildings like this emit a low enough frequency that you can't consciously hear.
because the sensory overload can't be explained, it wreaks havoc with your emotions, inducing fear, panic, and dread, hence the feeling of being haunted.
what about the visions?
your eyes overcompensate for what your ears are missing.
that said, I do know a 3-year-old boy that once met a friendly apparition named Leverett Saltonstall.
he was nice? - Very nice.
you'd think the laundry room would be closer to the dorms. -It's not in the basement?
it's on the opposite side of campus.
that's so strange. - Yeah.
leaves of 3, let them be.
Oh, man. Poison Ivy. Alcohol swabs, Stat.
thank you. You know, if I've got it, so do you.
I'm Italian. It knows better. Where's Massey?
he's meeting with the victims' families. They're arriving now.
JJ, how are Josh's parents? -Upset. They sent him here to keep him away from trouble.
Tawes made it seem like these guys are the only family they have.
you make it sound like a cult. -Uh, it kind of is.
this is a well-respected institution. -They're not on trial.
the integral part of the investigation is going to be understanding what these victims lived every day.
and with who Bailey Shelton killed himself in Josh Redding's room.
was Josh in the room that night?
according to the records. - I will dig for dirt.
Dave, you find anything in the woods? -Josh's tent was secluded.
his things were left behind. He just took off.
Massey said he never got any respect from Josh.
and Josh's own parents said he was impossible to control.
his course load indicates increased isolation.
isolated, smart, angry.
that could be a budding psychopath.
what are you saying? Josh Redding killed his classmates?
then he's not missing. He's on the run.
and he was been for a week. -One hell of a head start.
with all the skills he could ever need.
Stand...A-ten-hut!
Present...Arms!
Order...Arms!
Colonel, any sign of Josh?
Tawes was out there all night.
the volunteers have spread out to the next county.
where do you think he'd go? -To higher ground.
but we would have seen him by now.
sir, you said it was Josh who found Bailey hanging in his room, correct?
when he woke up, yes.
you didn't find it to be odd that Josh could sleep through that?
what are you saying?
Josh is the only person in common with all these deaths.
you think Josh killed Bailey?
it's a possibility.
I sent a murderer into the woods.
whoever did this wanted us to find them just like Bailey Shelton.
OK, so how did he do it?
how did Josh control 5 strong kids?
Josh supervised the cadets both in the bunk and the laundry room.
that could explain how the sheets got out.
Yeah, so what does "we're sorry" mean if it wasn't written for suicide?
what if Josh wanted them to apologize for something?
for their sins? There's no record of bad behavior,
they were all upperclassmen who might have bullied Bailey.
but all of these guys were Alpha males.
the message was carved under Tucker Calhoun's tree for a reason.
Yeah. We need to know more about that kid.
what are you looking at?
the M. E.'s report. Bilateral fracture of the pars intraarticular of the C2 vertebra.
Uh-huh. What's that?
classic hangman's fracture, but only one of the 5 victims had it.
which one? -Tucker Calhoun.
jeez, who is this guy?
the others suffered rotational fractures, hanging was secondary.
staging the crime scene. Josh is more sophisticated than we thought.
and vindictive. He wanted Tucker to suffer.
the question is why.
Tawes thinks he's on a rescue mission.
he still is.
we've got an enemy out there.
someone who killed 6 of my boys.
we need to figure out why.
we need to start with everyone who knows Josh. -...March!
no, ma'am, Josh didn't have friends.
why is that? -It depends on who you ask, sir.
what was his relationship with Tucker Calhoun?
Josh is straight up. This place never broke him.
no matter how hard they tried.
who tried to break him? Tucker?
a cadet will not lie, cheat, steal, or tolerate those who do.
you've got an honor code.
my guess is not everyone lives by it.
you do.
ma'am. Sir.
right face!
forward march!
they all gonna be like that?
not all of them.
we shall defend our island, "whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills, we shall never surrender."
we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be.
why the hell would Josh hurt them?
has Josh been more distant this year?
well, his course load is extreme.
did he specifically complain about anyone to you?
I already told you no.
you said he was frustrated being saddled with the younger cadets?
that boy Bailey cried himself to sleep every damn night.
maybe Josh had had enough of that.
he met him outside.
Bailey's father couldn't come into this building.
so Josh folded is clothes, his towels, everything, all so that his dad wouldn't have to walk past this room.
that's what my son did.
that's who my son is.
is it true Josh killed them all? -Do you think he did?
I wouldn't fool with Josh. -You're a smart kid.
he's a big guy.
you ever see him fight? -All the time.
what about Josh and Tucker Calhoun? Did they ever get into it?
Tucker was an ass.
he used to come in here and pee on the sheets after we washed them.
did he do that on the night that Bailey Shelton committed suicide?
the bastard did it every night.
do you think Josh wanted to punish those kids for picking on Bailey?
sure. But he wasn't supposed to be on that trip, anyway.
what do you mean? -It's a leadership reward.
you gotta have at least 20 points to go. But Josh only had 16.
points? -They're posted.
more points, more rewards.
how many do you have? -Negative 5.
good luck.
thanks for the help.
no one told us about a point system.
so Tucker Calhoun has the most points.
who approves them? - Massey.
well, maybe Tucker was his little pet. -Leader of everything.
that comes with an attitude.
steamroller types like that, they don't let anybody get in their way.
nothing was nice about that kid. It sounds like he strong-armed everybody.
well, then the points are for bad behavior, only they're not calling it that.
we should look at the points of everyone who died in those woods.
my guess is they were all bullies. -Except for Josh.
Hotch, is something going on with Strauss?
Why?
well, she's awfully protective of this place.
she's got pressure from above.
you sure it's nothing else?
she doesn't like the field.
really.
any word from Josh?
no.
Colonel, we need to speak to Bailey Shelton's parents.
well, his mother died years ago. I could get hold of his father.
do that, please.
what's going on?
Josh had contact with Bailey's father the day he died.
and you think he could give you behavioral clues about Josh?
it's all we have right now, Strauss. -The man just lost his son.
do you really think he's going to remember how Josh acted?
by all means, I'm open to other suggestions.
Massey knows his students better than anyone.
why not trust him? -Because all Massey wants right now is for this to go away.
he'll tell us whatever he thinks we want to hear.
Oh, yeah.
what the hell was he doing way out here?
it isn't exactly the kind of place he'd stumble upon.
do you think Josh built this trap? -Right out of the Somerville handbook.
he even used his poncho to cover it. -He lured Chris Shelton here.
the body was still warm. Probably died just a few hours ago.
so Josh couldn't be far away.
Tawes already took off. Thinks he can find him.
a little help?
so why would Josh want Bailey's father dead?
the duffel's from Somerville.
it's got Bailey's stuff in it
and these. -Bed sheets.
he's the one who hung those boys.
OK, so he blamed them for bullying his son, and Josh escaped.
Josh wasn't supposed to be out here in the first place.
this trap was to protect himself.
but this place isn't on any map.
how did Bailey's dad find it?
somebody tipped him off.
I make a promise to watch after these boys.
in many ways they're my own.
then something like this happens.
Colonel, so you're saying Josh was in his room the night that Bailey hung himself?
what is it with you people? I've already told Agent Morgan.
was Josh in his room? -Yes.
23 cadets sleep in that building. They're saying he wasn't there.
they're lying. -But that's against your code.
they haven't been here long enough to understand the importance of it.
did Josh find Bailey in the laundry room after that check?
Bailey was his responsibility.
and who else was there?
no one.
are we finished? -Tucker Calhoun liked to pick on Bailey.
was he there? -No.
Josh didn't have enough points to go on the trip.
why did you send him?
he needed the challenge.
tell me this
did Josh kill Chris Shelton in the woods?
he was being chased, in which case it was self-defense.
Josh killed a man.
any advice on how to tell his parents?
Prentiss said Mr. Shelton had a cell phone. I'm gonna need to see that.
doesn't the school have a cell phone? -Mm-mmm. Goes against their policy, remember?
so is playing favorites. You know, a man like Massey sets rules but is the first to break them.
he's been left alone to run these kids' lives and nobody questions him.
Oh, man, that sounds so sad and scary when you put it like that.
his policies are a combination of many other philosophies.
I'm not sure where his actual leadership lies.
only that it does...Lie, that is. It's a joke.
Oh. Good joke.
Yeah. -Oh, my gosh.
the school does have a cell phone. Only it's not listed under Massey.
the account was opened... by Tawes.
if Massey's lying about something as simple as a cell phone, what else is he hiding?
I met Chris Shelton when he claimed his son's body.
this is the last thing I expected.
multiple points of entry from the spears.
he still wears his wedding ring. Bailey was all he had left.
he'd do anything to protect him. -I'm not sure about that.
Bailey's trachea showed signs of scarring.
he'd attempted suicide before? -No. It was internal damage.
he had stress to his heart and lungs that isn't typical in someone his age.
it's not in your report. -It wasn't related to the C.O.D.
how old are the injuries? -It's hard to say.
then you assume his father was abusive? -Someone was.
I didn't think much of it till I saw similar scars on the other boys.
including blisters and burns on their hands.
on all of them?
their scars were much older, but yes. Identical.
sir, may I?
when did you decide where the boys would be camping?
the day Tawes dropped them off.
no one else knew? -No need.
you didn't write it down anywhere? -We don't use maps of that terrain.
you're expected to know it.
Mr. Shelton must have been quite upset when you saw him.
of course he was.
who did he blame? -What?
for his son's suicide. Who did he blame?
I have no idea.
well, the guilt must have manifested itself elsewhere.
was it you? -Excuse me?
he was a desperate widower who put his son in your hands. He trusted you, and look what happened.
ma'am... - What?
we're trying to help him and he's keeping things from us.
I have cooperated fully.
did you blame someone?
this is ridiculous. -Oh, for God sakes, Colonel!
he didn't just find that campsite all by himself.
it's time you leave.
I'm sorry. I just don't have the patience for this.
he's clearly hiding something.
all due respect, ma'am, have you been drinking?
what? What are you talking about?
Strauss, we have one shot at this.
you think I don't know that?
well, if he smelled what I can smell on your breath right now, the credibility of this investigation would be compromised.
the organ damage is severe, like the boys have been suffocated, but what about the blisters?
the youngest cadets probably have the freshest scars.
all right, well, we're gonna need one of them to admit it.
Hotch, she's drinking.
Strauss? -Yeah. She needs help, man.
she could blow this case.
what happened? -She laid into Massey.
she actually said the kind of things I would have said.
and for a minute I was like, ok, good. She's finally on our side.
but then I smelled it, Hotch.
I asked you if something was going on.
you partnered me with her. -Morgan, she was getting help.
I'm gonna have to call E.A.P. But this is not
what? This is not about me? Is that what you were gonna say?
you know how many times I've heard that, Hotch? Well, I am tired of it.
you keep telling me that I have problems trusting people.
well, from where I'm standing, you're the one who can't trust anyone with anything.
any sign of Josh? -Tawes is still looking.
I need to find students who are having trouble with authority.
OK, I can do that.
but I gotta tell you, they post rewards faster than they do demerits.
all right, well, look for kids who had disciplinary issues before they came here.
OK. I got a few.
all right, did any of them have class with Bailey Shelton?
no, but each of the plebes have laundry duty. Does that help?
their dorm is the farthest point from the laundry room.
why are they so isolated?
the M.E. said Bailey had blisters and burns, fingertips were raw, his trachea had internal scarring.
that's awful.
guys, that could be damage done inside an industrial-size dryer.
Oh, my God.
that's how Massey's breaking these boys.
Hey, Bailey.
Tucker. Tucker, don't, please.
please, Tucker. Please.
please, Tucker. Please!
please! Stop it!
please stop it! I can't breathe!
please! - Let him out!
go, Bailey, run!
no. In all the materials it says they don't believe in corporal punishment.
Bailey writes about each of those boys and how they bullied him.
his father must have read it and wants revenge.
does it mention Josh? - Not at all.
they why would Chris Shelton go after him?
what if Massey lied to Chris Shelton?
and set Josh up.
and he convinced Shelton that Josh was responsible for Bailey's suicide.
that still doesn't explain how he found the secluded woods.
wait, where's Mr. Shelton's phone?
it's right here.
it's got a couple of contacts on it, Somerville Academy being one of them.
any unknowns? Tawes has a cell.
no way. Lieutenant no tech?
there's one unknown. It's a text. It looks like, uh, phone numbers.
what are they?
and 802-8448.
those aren't phone numbers. That's latitude and longitude.
right where those boys were camping.
Massey's withheld information at every step along the way.
he's not to be trusted. - What's your theory?
he's created a dysfunctional and abusive environment in which children like Bailey Shelton and others are repeatedly abused.
Josh is a protector type.
his power was taken away the night Bailey killed himself.
we believe that's when everything shifted.
Josh's parents said he's been withdrawn since Bailey's suicide.
there's a good chance that's because he was planning his escape.
Josh didn't have enough points to go into the woods, but Massey sent him anyway.
why would Massey give Josh the opportunity to escape?
he wouldn't. He had another agenda.
Massey texted Chris Shelton the coordinates for the campsite, not to hurt all the boys, but to take out Josh.
but he didn't count on Josh fighting back.
and he underestimated the power of Chris Shelton's revenge.
staging the murders to look exactly like Bailey's death was a message.
to who? -To Massey.
Chris Shelton wanted Massey to lose his sons, too.
Josh knows Massey has secrets, and he's the only person who can bring the school down.
and now Massey will do anything to destroy Josh.
sir.
have you found him yet? -Negative, sir.
you finish this. Understand?
Yes, sir.
we need to find Josh before Tawes does. -Tawes has a massive head start.
Josh is close and has a plan. How would he escape? --Get to higher ground.
what's the fastest way out?
he'd look for wheels. How did Chris Shelton get there?
he probably drove his own car. We didn't see any ATVs.
Chris Shelton drives a truck.
did you see one on the road on the way in?
no. - Where's the next closest road?
well, it's a trek. It's at least a few miles north of where the body was just found.
that leaves 3 likely areas where he would have parked.
Mm-mmm. - You didn't find any keys, did you?
because Josh probably took them. --All right, we need to divide up.
come on.
I've waited 3 years for this.
you little bitch.
Uhh! - Tawes, don't do it.
it's over.
Yes, Mrs. Jarvis.
I understand your concerns, but we're all fine.
soldiers, ma'am.
call anytime.
Colonel Ron Massey, you're under arrest.
I've done nothing.
you texted Chris Shelton the coordinates of the campsite.
that makes you an accessory to murder.
texted? -Ok, fine.
you had Tawes do it.
why would I do that?
because you had no power or control over Josh, and you couldn't handle that.
the problem is, he wasn't gonna go away quietly.
he wanted you to pay for all those years of abuse.
no one will believe Josh. He's a troubled boy.
he's a grown man, Colonel.
you should be proud.
beware, so long as you live, of judging men by their outward appearance.
Jean de La Fontaine.
you got a minute?
Yeah.
do you have the after-action report? -No.
I need it on my desk by the morning.
I'll give it to the director.
pardon?
it's time for you to admit that you need some help.
I don't take orders from you, Aaron.
you put my team in jeopardy.
is that what you told him, Agent Morgan?
you compromised the integrity of the unit.
I did no such thing.
open the drawer, ma'am.
this is absurd. Aaron.
aaron, what are you doing?
one call to the E.A.P. and everything will be all right.
in what world will this be all right?
you have no idea what this is going to do to me.
agent Morgan will make sure that you get checked in privately.
and for that you should be grateful.
I'll wait outside.
didn't come out here to play games!
bus is leaving in 5 minutes.
get your gear or it stays.
you're out here 6 days, boys.
had a chance to prove yourselves.
and what have you done?
showed me you're a bunch of lazy sons of bitches.
I got your message.
good. What do you think?
it presents as mass suicide.
can you prove it?
not without visiting the campus.
that's what I thought.
I can't make an assessment without meeting the faculty and students.
I know.
it-- the school is up for the federal Tomlinson grant.
this does not bode well.
the director's a graduate of Somerville Academy, isn't he?
Yes. And he's been fighting for the government funding.
these boys killed themselves for a reason.
no one should write that off.
I'm not asking you to.
Somerville Military Academy, Oceanside, Florida, 5 boys were found hanging this morning.
the bodies are at the medical examiner's now.
there's no photos?
school personnel thought they may still be alive, so they cut them out of the trees.
so we're walking into a contaminated crime scene.
we don't have anything solid?
"we're sorry" was carved in a tree branch nearby.
this happened on campus?
no, in the woods about an hour away.
how long were they out there? - 6 days.
without supervision?
it was an outward bound mission for the upperclassmen.
what drove them to suicide?
a freshman cadet, Bailey Shelton, hung himself 2 weeks ago in his room.
identical bed sheet, hangman's knot.
who takes sheets camping?
they would if it was the plan.
could be domino effect.
the campus would have been on high alert after the first one, so the kids wait until they're alone in the woods.
they must have made some kind of pact.
and there's something else. 6 kids went on the trip.
only 5 were found.
the school officials confirm that Josh Redding is still missing.
so maybe he chickened out of the pact.
or was never a part of it.
and the campus is completely off the grid.
no Internet.
I can help with that.
which is why you're coming with us.
and so am I.
isn't Somerville the director's alma mater?
Yes.
the academy has enjoyed a spotless reputation, so the hope is to keep the investigation in house.
I imagine there's a lot of concern for Josh.
he's been in those woods almost a week.
so how's he surviving?
"things do not change. We change." Henry David Thoreau.
there's still no sign of Josh Redding.
we'll join the search.
so, the Somerville Academy was founded during World War II.
it is hard-core old school.
they don't even have a website.
socioeconomic breakdown's all over the map.
Yeah, so are the ages.
students are 12 to 18 years old, on the same campus, in the same dorms.
same personnel has worked there for a lifetime.
Ron Massey has been superintendent for 30 years.
he's an alum, as is the majority of the staff there.
lieutenant Tawes has been his second in command this whole time.
these type of places have their own infrastructure.
if it ain't broken, they ain't gonna fix it.
that's probably why they banned modern technology.
they didn't need it back then, they don't need it now.
aggressive motto-- "vivere est vincere."
to live is to conquer.
the school raises soldiers.
suicide is not part of that mantra.
Bailey Shelton was only 13 years old.
he was one of the youngest students there.
his death is probably the key to the others.
Colonel Massey, Erin Strauss.
this is the team I spoke with you about.
agent Hotchner.
this is Agent Morgan, Agent Jareau, Dr. Spencer Reid, and Penelope Garcia.
so shouldn't the flag be at half-mast?
I haven't told the boys yet.
do they know who we are?
I'll tell them when the time is right.
I've called all of the parents.
they're driving from up and down the East Coast.
in fact, Josh Redding's have just arrived.
I'd like to speak with them.
they're in the chapel. - How are they?
as you'd expect.
all right, I'll get started.
cadet.
any leads on Josh?
in that terrain, he's only capable of moving a mile an hour.
puts him in a 60-mile radius.
that's 3, 600 square miles to cover.
Tawes knows those woods better than anybody.
we've got two agents meeting and we'll start the investigation here.
Where's the place with the most outlets?
best bet is in the library.
thank you.
we'd like to start with Bailey Shelton's suicide.
do you have a copy of the medical examiner's report?
I don't. But there was no question he hung himself.
well, the nuances can tell us a lot.
the doctor's receiving the last of the bodies now.
I expect he's got his hands full.
I'll speak to him later.
of course.
it would be helpful to us to know what Bailey's last day was like.
I'll show you.
he stayed in the plebes hall.
his father took all of his belongings after the suicide.
Josh's items are as they were.
Josh stayed with the first years?
he's the brigade commander.
Bailey's suicide hit him hard.
were all the victims friends of Bailey's?
brotherhood is the very price and condition of man's survival.
Carlos Romulo.
all of my boys are brothers.
there's Tucker Calhoun's parents.
excuse me.
if the boys were so vulnerable, why did they send them into the woods?
because it was time for their survival test.
we have a docket.
it's been only two weeks since the initial suicide.
you couldn't postpone this trip?
classes were canceled the day after Bailey died.
but men are lost in battle all the time.
this isn't battle, and these aren't men.
they are when they leave here.
how many suicides have you seen?
just these.
so part of the mission was unsupervised?
for a week.
but you came back 6 days later.
standard procedure to check in if the weather's extreme.
had lightning and thunder last night.
the boys didn't have any way to communicate with you?
smoke signal.
Seriously?
basic survival skills, ma'am.
we teach them to follow their instincts, not rely on technology.
no radio, no weapons.
well, survival courses like these often trigger a fight or flight response.
it looks like that's what happened to Josh.
who slept here?
don't know. They're all identical.
whoever was here took off.
and it's secluded.
did Josh Redding isolate himself a lot?
I suppose.
he was a loner.
and why is that?
he didn't want to be at Somerville in the first place.
why did you send Josh here?
because he was getting into a lot of trouble.
and he was always angry and...
he was being a teenager.
you were gone, Will.
all the time.
he was nearly 6 feet tall by the time he was 14.
with a bad temper, and he was punching holes in walls, and he wouldn't listen to me anymore.
he could be belligerent.
but this-- this was extreme.
Why?
we had to force him.
what are you doing? Let me go!
we're helping you, Josh.
mom, dad, please, don't let them do this!
they're not gonna hurt you.
dad, please!
I was afraid he was gonna hurt himself.
or someone else if we didn't get him some help.
how was Josh taking Bailey's suicide?
we only talked once after that.
phone calls are a privilege here. Was that difficult for Josh?
Josh has never been much of a talker, but I think he felt a real responsibility for Bailey and the other boys in the hall.
did he ever tell you why Bailey may have killed himself?
no.
Mr. Redding.
how are you gonna get my boy back here?
these beds are all 3 feet apart and there's absolutely no privacy.
how did Bailey hang himself without anybody noticing?
apparently he did it in here.
he used Josh's room?
according to Massey, Josh offered Bailey a lot of support.
he told you that?
Yes, when we spoke.
is that a problem?
is there anything else he mentioned?
the boys come in here just to sleep. It's why it's so minimal.
Strauss, what, are you on the board or something?
I just saw the campus same as you.
it's hardly a prison.
these kids are told what to wear, what to say, and when to eat.
this goes against the very nature of these boys.
they're all looking for some type of control in their lives, and this place strips them of that.
and suicide is the ultimate power?
isn't it?
well, at least the boys felt enough remorse to write "we're sorry.
that doesn't trump taking your own life.
what is it?
but I guess I can buy that the other kids couldn't hear Bailey hang himself.
Josh was laying right here.
I've never seen a mass suicide apology.
maybe they knew it would help their parents.
could be confessing other sins.
who was in this tree?
good cadet.
looks like Josh has doubled back a few times.
but the dogs can't find him.
is he familiar with these woods?
all first years come here for a mission.
Josh tried to run away back then but didn't get far.
none of them do.
but after 3 more years of training...
he didn't weigh himself down with supplies.
smart.
we taught him well.
Colonel, it's been 6 days since the suicides.
why hasn't Josh come back to campus?
he's got trust issues.
I thought he was doing well.
too smart for his own good.
the most dangerous kind.
dangerous to whom? - Himself.
boys like Josh reject the lessons of men.
his generation has little respect for their elders.
does that include you?
we've been working on it.
all the first years start in the laundry room.
it teaches them responsibility.
Ten-hut!
Bailey finished his rotation and walked back to his bunk.
so he was still here for bed check?
it wasn't the first time.
was he punished for being late?
if you're suggesting that Bailey killed himself because of a talking to, that's absurd.
that could depend on what you said.
he understood I was disappointed.
were the victims' bunks made before they went into the woods?
each and every morning.
so where did they get the sheets to hang themselves?
carry on.
come on, baby. Come on.
Boo!
jeez, you scared me. I thought you were a ghost.
you know, older buildings like this emit a low enough frequency that you can't consciously hear.
because the sensory overload can't be explained, it wreaks havoc with your emotions, inducing fear, panic, and dread, hence the feeling of being haunted.
what about the visions?
your eyes overcompensate for what your ears are missing.
that said, I do know a 3-year-old boy that once met a friendly apparition named Leverett Saltonstall.
he was nice? - Very nice.
you'd think the laundry room would be closer to the dorms.
it's not in the basement?
it's on the opposite side of campus. That's so strange.
Yeah.
leaves of 3, let them be.
Oh, man. - Poison Ivy.
alcohol swabs, stat.
thank you.
you know, if I've got it, so do you.
I'm Italian. It knows better.
Where's Massey?
he's meeting with the victims' families. They're arriving now.
JJ, how are Josh's parents?
upset. They sent him here to keep him away from trouble.
Tawes made it seem like these guys are the only family they have.
you make it sound like a cult.
uh, it kind of is.
this is a well-respected institution.
they're not on trial.
the integral part of the investigation is going to be understanding what these victims lived every day.
and with who.
Bailey Shelton killed himself in Josh Redding's room.
was Josh in the room that night?
according to the records.
I will dig for dirt.
Dave, you find anything in the woods?
Josh's tent was secluded. His things were left behind.
he just took off.
Massey said he never got any respect from Josh.
and Josh's own parents said he was impossible to control.
his course load indicates increased isolation.
isolated, smart, angry.
that could be a budding psychopath.
what are you saying?
Josh Redding killed his classmates?
then he's not missing.
he's on the run.
and he was been for a week.
one hell of a head start.
with all the skills he could ever need.
Present...Arms!
Order...Arms!
Colonel, any sign of Josh?
Tawes was out there all night.
the volunteers have spread out to the next county.
where do you think he'd go?
to higher ground.
but we would have seen him by now.
sir, you said it was Josh who found Bailey hanging in his room, correct?
when he woke up, yes.
you didn't find it to be odd that Josh could sleep through that?
what are you saying?
Josh is the only person in common with all these deaths.
you think Josh killed Bailey?
it's a possibility.
I sent a murderer into the woods.
whoever did this wanted us to find them just like Bailey Shelton.
OK, so how did he do it?
how did Josh control 5 strong kids?
Josh supervised the cadets both in the bunk and the laundry room.
that could explain how the sheets got out.
Yeah, so what does "we're sorry" mean if it wasn't written for suicide?
what if Josh wanted them to apologize for something?
for their sins?
there's no record of bad behavior, but all of these guys were Alpha males.
the were all upperclassmen who might have bullied Bailey.
the message was carved under Tucker Calhoun's tree for a reason.
Yeah. We need to know more about that kid.
what are you looking at? - The M. E.'s report.
bilateral fracture of the pars interarticular of the C2 vertebra.
what's that?
classic hangman's fracture, but only one of the 5 victims had it.
which one? - Tucker Calhoun.
Garcia: Jeez, who is this guy?
the others suffered rotational fractures, hanging was secondary.
staging the crime scene.
Josh is more sophisticated than we thought.
and vindictive.
he wanted Tucker to suffer.
the question is why.
Tawes thinks he's on a rescue mission.
he still is.
we've got an enemy out there.
someone who killed 6 of my boys.
we need to figure out why.
we need to start with everyone who knows Josh.
...March!
no, ma'am, Josh didn't have friends.
why is that?
it depends on who you ask, sir.
what was his relationship with Tucker Calhoun?
Josh is straight up.
this place never broke him.
no matter how hard they tried.
who tried to break him? Tucker?
a cadet will not lie, cheat, steal, or tolerate those who do.
you've got an honor code.
my guess is not everyone lives by it.
you do.
ma'am. Sir.
right face!
forward march!
they all gonna be like that?
not all of them.
"we shall defend our island," "whatever the cost may be," "we shall fight on the beaches," "we shall fight on the landing grounds," "we shall fight in the fields and in the streets," "we shall fight in the hills," "we shall never surrender."
we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be.
why the hell would Josh hurt them?
has Josh been more distant this year?
well, his course load is extreme.
did he specifically complain about anyone to you?
I already told you no.
you said he was frustrated being saddled with the younger cadets?
that boy Bailey cried himself to sleep every damn night.
maybe Josh had had enough of that.
he met him outside.
Bailey's father couldn't come into this building.
so Josh folded is clothes, his towels, everything, all so that his dad wouldn't have to walk past this room.
that's what my son did.
that's who my son is.
is it true Josh killed them all?
do you think he did?
I wouldn't fool with Josh.
you're a smart kid. He's a big guy.
you ever see him fight?
all the time.
what about Josh and Tucker Calhoun?
did they ever get into it?
Tucker was an ass.
he used to come in here and pee on the sheets after we washed them.
did he do that on the night that Bailey Shelton committed suicide?
the bastard did it every night.
do you think Josh wanted to punish those kids for picking on Bailey?
sure. But he wasn't supposed to be on that trip, anyway.
what do you mean?
it's a leadership reward.
you gotta have at least 20 points to go.
but Josh only had 16.
points?
they're posted. More points, more rewards.
how many do you have?
negative 5.
good luck.
thanks for the help.
no one told us about a point system.
so Tucker Calhoun has the most points.
who approves them? - Massey.
well, maybe Tucker was his little pet.
leader of everything.
that comes with an attitude.
steamroller types like that, they don't let anybody get in their way.
nothing was nice about that kid.
it sounds like he strong-armed everybody.
well, then the points are for bad behavior, only they're not calling it that.
we should look at the points of everyone who died in those woods.
my guess is they were all bullies.
except for Josh.
Hotch, is something going on with Strauss?
Why?
well, she's awfully protective of this place.
she's got pressure from above.
you sure it's nothing else?
she doesn't like the field.
really. Any word from Josh?
no.
Colonel, we need to speak to Bailey Shelton's parents.
well, his mother died years ago.
I could get hold of his father.
do that, please.
what's going on?
Josh had contact with Bailey's father the day he died.
and you think he could give you behavioral clues about Josh?
it's all we have right now, Strauss.
the man just lost his son.
do you really think he's going to remember how Josh acted?
by all means, I'm open to other suggestions.
Massey knows his students better than anyone. Why not trust him?
because all Massey wants right now is for this to go away.
he'll tell us whatever he thinks we want to hear.
Oh, yeah.
what the hell was he doing way out here?
it isn't exactly the kind of place he'd stumble upon.
do you think Josh built this trap?
right out of the Somerville handbook.
he even used his poncho to cover it.
he lured Chris Shelton here.
the body was still warm. Probably died just a few hours ago.
so Josh couldn't be far away.
Tawes already took off. Thinks he can find him.
a little help?
so why would Josh want Bailey's father dead?
the duffel's from Somerville.
it's got Bailey's stuff in it-- and these.
bed sheets.
he's the one who hung those boys.
OK, so he blamed them for bullying his son, and Josh escaped.
Josh wasn't supposed to be out here in the first place.
this trap was to protect himself.
but this place isn't on any map.
how did Bailey's dad find it?
somebody tipped him off.
I make a promise to watch after these boys.
in many ways they're my own.
then something like this happens.
Colonel, so you're saying Josh was in his room the night that Bailey hung himself?
what is it with you people? I've already told Agent Morgan.
was Josh in his room?
Yes.
23 cadets sleep in that building. They're saying he wasn't there.
they're lying.
but that's against your code.
they haven't been here long enough to understand the importance of it.
did Josh find Bailey in the laundry room after that check?
Bailey was his responsibility.
and who else was there?
no one.
are we finished?
Tucker Calhoun liked to pick on Bailey. Was he there?
no.
Josh didn't have enough points to go on the trip.
why did you send him?
he needed the challenge.
tell me this-- did Josh kill Chris Shelton in the woods?
he was being chased, in which case it was self-defense.
Josh killed a man.
any advice on how to tell his parents?
Prentiss said Mr. Shelton had a cell phone.
I'm gonna need to see that.
doesn't the school have a cell phone?
goes against their policy, remember?
so is playing favorites.
you know, a man like Massey sets rules but is the first to break them.
he's been left alone to run these kids' lives and nobody questions him.
Oh, man, that sounds so sad and scary when you put it like that.
his policies are a combination of many other philosophies.
I'm not sure where his actual leadership lies.
only that it does...Lie, that is.
it's a joke.
good joke. - Yeah.
Oh, my gosh.
the school does have a cell phone. Only it's not listed under Massey.
the account was opened...
by Tawes.
if Massey's lying about something as simple as a cell phone, what else is he hiding?
I met Chris Shelton when he claimed his son's body.
this is the last thing I expected.
multiple points of entry from the spears.
he still wears his wedding ring.
Bailey was all he had left.
he'd do anything to protect him.
I'm not sure about that.
Bailey's trachea showed signs of scarring.
he'd attempted suicide before?
no. It was internal damage.
he had stress to his heart and lungs that isn't typical in someone his age.
it's not in your report.
it wasn't related to the C. O.D.
how old are the injuries?
it's hard to say.
then you assume his father was abusive?
someone was.
I didn't think much of it till I saw similar scars on the other boys.
including blisters and burns on their hands.
on all of them?
their scars were much older, but yes.
identical.
sir, may I?
when did you decide where the boys would be camping?
the day Tawes dropped them off.
no one else knew?
no need.
you didn't write it down anywhere?
we don't use maps of that terrain.
you're expected to know it.
Mr. Shelton must have been quite upset when you saw him.
of course he was.
who did he blame?
what?
for his son's suicide. Who did he blame?
I have no idea.
well, the guilt must have manifested itself elsewhere.
was it you?
excuse me?
he was a desperate widower who put his son in your hands.
he trusted you, and look what happened.
ma'am... - What?
we're trying to help him and he's keeping things from us.
I have cooperated fully.
did you blame someone?
Josh Redding?
Tucker Calhoun?
this is ridiculous. - Oh, for God sakes, Colonel!
he didn't just find that campsite all by himself.
it's time you leave.
I'm sorry. I just don't have the patience for this.
he's clearly hiding something.
all due respect, ma'am, have you been drinking?
what?
what are you talking about?
Strauss, we have one shot at this.
you think I don't know that?
well, if he smelled what I can smell on your breath right now, the credibility of this investigation would be compromised.
the organ damage is severe, like the boys have been suffocated, but what about the blisters?
the youngest cadets probably have the freshest scars.
all right, well, we're gonna need one of them to admit it.
Hotch, she's drinking.
Strauss? - Yeah.
she needs help, man.
she could blow this case.
what happened?
she laid into Massey.
she actually said the kind of things I would have said.
and for a minute I was like, ok, good.
she's finally on our side.
but then I smelled it, Hotch.
I asked you if something was going on.
you partnered me with her.
Morgan, she was getting help.
I'm gonna have to call E. A.P.
but this is not-- What? This is not about me?
is that what you were gonna say?
you know how many times I've heard that, Hotch? Well, I am tired of it.
you keep telling me that I have problems trusting people.
well, from where I'm standing, you're the one who can't trust anyone with anything.
any sign of Josh?
Tawes is still looking.
I need to find students who are having trouble with authority.
OK, I can do that.
but I gotta tell you, they post rewards faster than they do demerits.
all right, well, look for kids who had disciplinary issues before they came here.
OK. I got a few.
all right, did any of them have class with Bailey Shelton?
no, but each of the plebes have laundry duty. Does that help?
their dorm is the farthest point from the laundry room.
why are they so isolated?
the M. E. said Bailey had blisters and burns, fingertips were raw, his trachea had internal scarring.
that's awful.
guys, that could be damage done inside an industrial-size dryer.
Oh, my God.
that's how Massey's breaking these boys.
Hey, Bailey.
Tucker. Tucker, don't, please.
please, Tucker.
please. Please, Tucker.
please! Please! Stop it! Please stop it!
I can't breathe!
please! - Let him out!
go, Bailey, run!
no. In all the materials it says they don't believe in corporal punishment.
Bailey writes about each of those boys and how they bullied him.
his father must have read it and wants revenge.
does it mention Josh? - Not at all.
they why would Chris Shelton go after him?
what if Massey lied to Chris Shelton?
and set Josh up.
and he convinced Shelton that Josh was responsible for Bailey's suicide.
that still doesn't explain how he found the secluded woods.
wait, where's Mr. Shelton's phone?
it's right here.
it's got a couple of contacts on it, Somerville Academy being one of them.
any unknowns? Tawes has a cell.
no way. Lieutenant no tech?
there's one unknown. It's a text.
it looks like, uh, phone numbers.
what are they?
and 802-8448.
those aren't phone numbers. That's latitude and longitude.
right where those boys were camping.
Massey's withheld information at every step along the way.
he's not to be trusted. - What's your theory?
he's created a dysfunctional and abusive environment in which children like Bailey Shelton and others are repeatedly abused.
Josh is a protector type.
his power was taken away the night Bailey killed himself.
we believe that's when everything shifted.
Josh's parents said he's been withdrawn since Bailey's suicide.
there's a good chance that's because he was planning his escape.
Josh didn't have enough points to go into the woods, but Massey sent him anyway.
why would Massey give Josh the opportunity to escape?
he wouldn't. He had another agenda.
Massey texted Chris Shelton the coordinates for the campsite, not to hurt all the boys, but to take out Josh.
but he didn't count on Josh fighting back.
and he underestimated the power of Chris Shelton's revenge.
staging the murders to look exactly like Bailey's death was a message.
to who?
to Massey.
Chris Shelton wanted Massey to lose his sons, too.
Josh knows Massey has secrets, and he's the only person who can bring the school down.
and now Massey will do anything to destroy Josh.
sir.
have you found him yet?
negative, sir.
you finish this. Understand?
Yes, sir.
we need to find Josh before Tawes does.
Tawes has a massive head start.
Josh is close and has a plan.
how would he escape?
get to higher ground.
what's the fastest way out?
he'd look for wheels. How did Chris Shelton get there?
he probably drove his own car. We didn't see any ATVs.
Chris Shelton drives a truck.
did you see one on the road on the way in?
no. - Where's the next closest road?
well, it's a trek. It's at least a few miles north of where the body was just found.
that leaves 3 likely areas where he would have parked.
you didn't find any keys, did you?
because Josh probably took them.
all right, we need to divide up.
I've waited 3 years for this.
you little bitch.
Tawes, don't do it.
it's over.
Yes, Mrs. Jarvis. I understand your concerns, but we're all fine.
soldiers, ma'am.
call anytime.
Colonel Ron Massey, you're under arrest.
I've done nothing.
you texted Chris Shelton the coordinates of the campsite.
that makes you an accessory to murder.
texted?
OK, fine.
you had Tawes do it.
why would I do that?
because you had no power or control over Josh, and you couldn't handle that.
the problem is, he wasn't gonna go away quietly.
he wanted you to pay for all those years of abuse.
no one will believe Josh.
he's a troubled boy.
he's a grown man, Colonel.
you should be proud.
beware, so long as you live, of judging men by their outward appearance.
Jean de La Fontaine.
you got a minute?
Yeah.
do you have the after-action report?
no.
I need it on my desk by the morning.
I'll give it to the director.
pardon?
it's time for you to admit that you need some help.
I don't take orders from you, Aaron.
you put my team in jeopardy.
is that what you told him, Agent Morgan?
you compromised the integrity of the unit. - I did no such thing.
open the drawer, ma'am.
this is absurd.
Aaron. Aaron, what are you doing?
one call to the E. A.P. and everything will be all right.
in what world will this be all right?
you have no idea what this is going to do to me.
agent Morgan will make sure that you get checked in privately.
and for that you should be grateful.
I'll wait outside.
I don't like it here. It's scary.
Hey. Let's get out of here.
in a minute.
seriously. I'm getting creeped out.
will you relax.
Oh, my God.
what's he doing?
who is that?
maybe it's the Park Service.
it was no one.
or was it the Iron Claw killer?
it's not funny. Let's get out of here.
that takes us back to 1968.
you're listening to your classic rock station in the Bay.
in the end, I just write about violent crime.
the real heroes are the people here beside me.
now give a warm welcome to our next speaker, Dr. Spencer Reid of the BAU.
thank you. Thanks. Patricia Cornwell, ladies and gentlemen.
ms. Cornwell will be signing books at the end of the session.
sorry. Um...
Hi. I am here today to talk to you about paraphilias and their relation to violent crime.
does anybody know what dendrophilia is?
Yes, a fetish for trees.
thank you so much for coming out, you guys, and as for your question earlier, the case that we were following at the time was the David Parker Ray case.
we actually believed that the victim count in that case was close to 60. Unfortunately, we were only able to unearth 45 bodies, but SSA Buffalino, um, has been diligent...
Dr. Reid?
Hey, you were fantastic up there.
thank you.
Yeah. I love the names of those paraphilias. I have a new list to memorize.
you like memorizing lists? I'm weird that way.
that's not weird at all. I do it all the time. You know, we don't usually get people your age here.
you're in school, I assume? Yeah, I'm a senior at Michigan.
you know what? You might like the FBI's internship program.
unfortunately, we're already past the deadline, but if you write me a letter,
I might be able to pull some strings.
uh... Thanks.
but I don't think my Board of Directors would allow it.
I have a company. Have you heard of Nanovex?
Nanovex, as in the company Landis Pharmaceuticals investing 100 million dollars in, Nanovex?
it's not a done deal yet.
uh, but, hey, you were awesome up there.
you saved me from a company party downstairs that was a total snooze fest.
keep up the good work. You, too.
who was that? That was the founder of Nanovex.
I've never heard of it.
they make magnetically responsive nanoparticles for targeted drug delivery to tumor cells.
I've still never heard of it.
you will. It's gonna change the world.
guess who's back. The Marin headlands last night.
david Atley and Nicole Puli, both 24, both grad students at Berkeley, shot multiple times in their vehicle-- wait for it.
the Zodiac? No way.
come on, it's gotta be the 2. 0 version.
Yeah, you would think so, except for the crazy similarities in the M. O.
I'm talking same victimology, same geography.
and two souvenirs were left at the crime scene. He left a photo?
Mm-hmm. Local police say that is Marcia Miller.
she was found near Napa in 1971.
strongly suspected that she was a victim of the Zodiac, but police never confirmed it and they didn't publicize the case.
so the Zodiac took this photo at the killing and then saved it all these years?
??The Zodiac's last confirmed victim was the cabdriver Paul Stine.
he mailed pieces of Stine's bloody shirt along with his letters to prove it was him.
this photo could prove he's back.
Oh... You just mentioned a bloody shirt?
this is the second souvenir that was left at the crime scene.
preliminary tests say that the blood type is O-negative.
same blood type as the cabdriver.
so how old would Zodiac be by now?
the murders took place in the late sixties?
Yeah. Uh, December 20, 1968, to October 11, 1969, to be exact, but he was suspected of other crimes, and he sent letters and codes to newspapers until 1974.
well, at the very least, the Zodiac would have to be about 60 by now.
but it doesn't take a lot of strength to pull a trigger.
no, but it takes a lot of skill not to get caught for 40 years.
have Reid and Prentiss meet us in San Francisco. Yes, sir.
Zodiac???
three can keep a secret if two are dead.
benjamin Franklin.
bottom line is Zodiac is the most well-documented unsolved serial killing case in modern times.
there have been two known copycats. Correct. The first one was Heriberto Seda.
he killed 3 and wounded 4 in New York City.
and then there was a 14-year-old in Japan named Saito Sakakibara.
he killed two other children and left the sign of the Zodiac behind.
the fact is, the Zodiac was driven by a need for notoriety and control.
he enjoyed the terror he spread through the city. Well, then he stopped.
after his last letter in '74, he vanished.
most likely wound up in a prison or a mental hospital.
maybe he was just released and picked up where he left off.
I will search for anyone recently freed or discharged after 40 years.
it's a long time to be dormant with no evolution in the M. O.
agreed. Even a serial killer has to grow up.
hmm. Check.
check.
checkmate.
Hey, Caleb, what the hell? Break time's over.
it's Harvey. Leave a message.
Yes. Agent Hotchner? I'm Agent Lin.
nice to meet you. This is Agent Jareau.
we're setting you up in the city field office.
all the Zodiac data has been sent over from local P. D.S.
good. That avoids jurisdiction issues.
according to the M. E. David Atley was shot twice in the head.
Nicole Puli was shot 13 times in the face, torso, and back.
weapon was a 9-millimeter. Overkill on the female.
the Zodiac did the same thing. He also used a 9-millimeter.
we're examining ballistics for a match.
take look over here.
we identified these as military Wing-Walker boots.
huh. Let me guess. Size 10 1/2.
just like the prints found at Lake Berryessa in '69.
what makes you think this is the real Zodiac, Agent?
the M. O. is uncannily similar.
if it's not him, then it's an equally evil twin.
or someone who's studied him meticulously.
have any letters or ciphers been received? Agent Lin, this is Dr. Reid, Agent Prentiss.
how was the conference? Enlightening.
has the unsub made any contact?
the "Chronicle's" website manager received two phone calls this morning.
there was just heavy breathing on the other end. Like the phone calls Zodiac used to make.
can I get a physical copy of the online version of today's paper?
you want a printout of the online version?
Yeah. With all the comments printed out as well, if possible, thanks.
don't ask.
it's not the real Zodiac.
how can you be so sure? I just know it.
sometimes I can't really explain it.
he hasn't had a visitor in ages.
he used to get so many when he was with the Napa P. D.
these people are from the FBI.
Hello, Detective. We're Agents Rossi and Morgan.
he has Parkinson's.
this is one of the bad days.
well, ma'am, maybe you could help us out. It won't take very long.
this is about the Zodiac, isn't it? I've been watching the news.
did Bob ever talk about his work?
that's all he talked about.
I tried to move his old boxes out, but he got so agitated, I had to bring them back.
do you mind if we take a look?
help yourself. Excuse me, I have to get his medication.
wow, she wasn't kidding when she said he liked to surround himself with his work.
these are all about Marcia Miller, who died in '71 and possibly killed by Zodiac.
Rossi, these are crime scene photos. Take a look at this.
Marcia Miller's photo could have come from this batch.
you know, a guy this obsessed with work probably used his own camera.
detective, did you take these pictures yourself at the crime scene?
now, you can blink once for yes and twice for no.
did you take these?
sir, is it possible that someone could have come in here and stolen one?
do you know who?
Mrs. Zablonsky, you said your husband used to get a lot of visitors?
Oh, yes. They were all people obsessed with the Zodiac.
well, do you think you can write down the names of all those that you remember?
Oh.
the dates match.
when Zodiac stopped killing, my cousin was put in a mental hospital in Mexico.
he was released 2 months ago.
do you have anything more specific?
he was working on a production of "The Mikado" in '68.
the Zodiac talked about "The Mikado" in a letter.
excuse me. I'm Dr. Reid with the Behavioral Analysis Unit.
was your cousin by chance a fan of Wagner?
because a CD of the "Tragic Overture" was sent to the police this morning.
he loved Wagner, especially the "Tragic Overture." It's him.
Oh, yeah. Well, for the record, a CD was not sent to the police this morning, and the "Tragic Overture" was written by Brahms, not Wagner, so luckily, I guess it's not your cousin.
the FBI would greatly appreciate it if people would stop making false claims to get their 15 minutes of fame.
thank you. Thank you very much.
well, this is quite a surprise development we just witnessed outside the San Francisco FBI building.
we'll have more for you later. Reporting live for Action News, back to you in the studio.
the best news is that when Harvey goes on his honeymoon, the rest of us will get two weeks of not looking so stupid at work.
seriously, it's a real honor to be your best man.
you and Marisa are perfect for each other, and I wish you all the happiness in the world.
Congrats. Enjoy the party. Cheers.
excuse me. I'd like to say something.
if I could direct your attention to the screen.
so that's me. Caleb Rossmore.
if you think I was funny-looking, you should have seen Harvey.
I met Harvey at the finals of the class "A" regional chess tournament.
I annihilated him.
but he still became my best friend.
I finally found someone else who was a child prodigy and a playground punching bag, too.
we became inseparable because of our shared love of Chess.
and some other weird stuff, right, Harv?
we liked animal dissection and Roman history and crime journalism
thank you. Thank you, Caleb-- Almost finished.
I didn't see Harvey as much after high school, but we always had a special connection.
I thought I knew him so well.
but I was completely shocked when I found out he was engaged to Marisa.
mainly because I couldn't believe the hot chick we both had a crush on in Junior High actually said yes to him.
anyway, buddy, I'll wrap it up.
your soul mate is standing before you now.
in the words of Plautus, let us celebrate with wine and sweet words.
that was so sweet. I almost cried.
Thanks, man. Listen, uh, I'm sorry I've been such a deadbeat friend.
I owe you a call.
Yeah, I'm getting used to the radio silence.
I'm sorry.
I have something for you.
I know it's normally the best man's job, but I asked if I could do it.
a ticket to Vegas.
for your bachelor party weekend.
I'm picking you up tomorrow at 6: 00.
Wow. Thanks, man, but I... I can't do a whole weekend.
I just have too much work. I thought it was one night.
Harvey, you have to go.
you're only getting married once.
Yes, ma'am.
terrific.
the detective's wife couldn't remember many names.
that's all right. We'll show her photos when we have a suspect.
I talked to Nicole Puli's mother. It doesn't seem she was stalked.
lab results are back on the piece of fabric.
the DNA doesn't match the original cabdriver.
and the cloth is fairly new.
it was distressed to look old.
guess I was foolish to think it was the real Zodiac.
well, he went to great pains to make us think it was him.
and he was criminally sophisticated enough to pull it off.
the question is why.
Reid, how's it going?
computers slow me down, so I prefer paper, but I wasn't expecting all these comments.
where do people find the time?
I think I just found a cipher from the unsub.
the symbols buried in the spam are the same ones the Zodiac used in his first message back in 1969.
what does it say?
killing is the most fun you can have 98 minutes below the horizon in magic city with President Garfield. Happy hunting.
the oracle is in. How may I assist?
Garcia, to what specific location does magic city refer?
birmingham, Alabama. 98 minutes below the horizon.
Garcia, what time is sunset there, tonight? 6: 22.
98 minutes there would be 8 p. m.
what's dedicated to President Garfield in San Francisco?
president Garfield...
there's a statue of him in Golden Gate Park.
no one at the south entrance yet.
copy that.
we've got a vehicle.
it's a lone driver.
move in.
FBI. Show me your hands.
drop it.
I'm just the messenger.
I'm supposed to deliver a letter.
it's for Reid.
you're not as smart as you think you are. Who sent it?
I don't know.
I just deliver it to the address when I'm supposed to.
if the unsub's not here, where is he?
please, take the money. Ohh... Do it.
please.
please don't hurt us, please. Please!
Tara Hanson was a teacher. Alec Wyseck was a lawyer.
they had dinner at a nearby restaurant and were taking an evening stroll.
the M. E. said Alec's throat was slit and he was stabbed twice in the back.
Tara was stabbed 20 times in the abdomen and torso.
overkill on the female again.
she's a brunette, like Nicole Puli. They both could have been surrogates.
he left this on the park bench. It's Nicole's.
her nickname was Kiki.
the courier service said the envelope was left with cash in their drop box.
the messenger himself had a clean record. He's a star employee.
this was a targeted message for an individual.
very different M. O.
it's a high vantage point.
the victims chose it for the view, the unsub so he could see if anyone was coming.
Hey, what's up?
Hey, boo, I tracked the ISP of the user who entered the spam comment to an Internet cafe, but he used a prepaid credit card, so I don't have an I. D.
all right, thanks, Garcia.
he used the same code that was broken years ago in a riddle we cracked in seconds.
he knew we'd solve it. It was a decoy.
no, it's a taunt. He wants to prove that he's smarter than everyone.
and we fell for it.
well, if he's trying to compete with me, then it means he's most likely within 5 years of my age.
the question is why.
but the message might not have been meant for you, Reid. A letter was hand-delivered to me last night.
the comment to the paper was written at 9: 03 a. m.
we weren't even in the city yet, so how would the unsub know you'd be involved in the case?
you did give your name to the press later that day, and you said yourself he knew we'd be in the park.
if he's doing his best to emulate the Zodiac, killing in such quick succession would be a mistake.
the shortest time span for a Zodiac was two weeks?
maybe the unsub doesn't have a choice.
maybe he's experiencing a time pressure that he has no control over.
unlike the real Zodiac, whose goal was mass hysteria, this copycat's message is directed at an individual woman with whom he's obsessed.
the women that he's killed so far have been surrogates for her.
he was either rejected or believes that he can't have her, so he feels a rage towards this woman and any man that she's with.
his actions may be an attempt to impress the object of his obsession or prove his love.
the unsub chose to copy the Zodiac because he wants to feel as brilliant, famous, and powerful as his predecessor.
you should be looking for a physically fit male in his 20s to 30s.
he's highly intelligent, but he holds a menial or low-level job.
he has few friends and fantasizes of a world in which he feels special.
and the frequency of the kills suggests that he may be on the verge of losing the object of his obsession.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Hey, how are you? Are you ok?
I need to talk to you about Harvey.
look, if you need to call off the wedding, everyone will understand.
what are you talking about? You were upset when you called.
and you said it was about Harvey.
no. I had a fight with my mom.
I wanted to talk to you about my surprise for Harvey.
a surprise?
a man cave. It will be installed over our honeymoon.
I got a 60-inch flat screen, a fridge for beer, but I need a "wow" item, like an air hockey table or a mini putting green.
are you serious? Yeah. What do you think he'd like?
I'm leaning towards the air hockey table, but I-- Marisa, stop.
please, just stop.
do you even know Harvey?
he'd hate it.
most guys like it, but he's weird.
trust me.
I'm just being honest.
and now you hate me.
no, I don't.
I always say all the wrong things, especially around you.
I really just want you to like me.
I've always wanted that.
I do like you.
look, I gotta run. I have so much wedding stuff to do.
order more flowers, I have another dress fitting at 2: 00, pick up gifts.
thank you. I'll see you later.
Hey. Are you gonna tell me what's up?
Reid, it's me.
do you even wonder if you lived up to expectations?
Mm... I beat them.
I figured I'd be a bored socialite by 25.
I thought I'd cure schizophrenia by the time I was 25.
you know, when I was a kid, people told me that I could do anything.
you're afraid you've let people down?
no, I'm afraid I've let myself down.
by not curing schizophrenia?
no, just because...
I don't know why I'm in the FBI.
I see.
you're a genius, but you have the same job as me, Morgan, JJ.
Yeah, exactly. No, that's not what I'm saying.
it's just sometimes-- sometimes I kind of get this feeling like maybe I should have done something more with my life.
hold old are you? 29.
I'm 30.
no way. We missed your birthday?
Well--why didn't you tell us?
the fact of the matter is you're young.
there's still time.
by the time Nicola Tesla was 30, he'd already invented the induction motor.
you know what? You might be right.
you don't hear that much about child prodigies once they grow up.
in fact, most of them turn out average.
that's not true.
are you trying reverse psychology with me? I'm just telling it like it is.
what are you doing? Well, you just told me yourself you're washed up.
I should take a look at this. That's not what I'm saying.
It's--seriously, what are you doing? I'm just looking to see what you missed.
don't do--you're gonna actually mess it up. Emily give it back.
wait a minute, that's it.
the real code is in the words.
"china Weekly Post," page F-4.
the spam had to be converted from matrix code to binary code, then switched to base 8 before being translated back into letters.
I can go into more detail if you want.
uh, no. How smart would a person have to be to write code like that?
beyond smart. Profoundly gifted. An I. Q. of at least 160.
that changes the profile, then.
the unsub could still hold a menial or low-level job.
many believe that beyond an I. Q. of 120, success is determined by other factors.
this is a bilingual paper. The English version should be somewhere.
Garcia, I need you to compile a list of people with I. Q.s of 160 or above in the region.
checking with the Bay Area Mensa Society.
which is kind of slumming it, 'cause folks can get in with a measly I. Q. of 130.
also check old school records. We're looking for someone who's in his 20s or 30s.
Yeah. Hit you back when I got something. All right.
all right, this is it. "You could do some much better."
I'll talk to the manager, see if they know who placed the ad.
who's this message for? The writer's a genius, but the recipient would have to be, too, in order to decode it.
Yeah, Dave.
all right. A cabdriver's just been murdered.
in broad daylight, with no witnesses.
the engine was still running. What, was he dropping the unsub off?
in '69, Zodiac killed the cabdriver from the backseat.
but this driver was shot from outside.
look at this.
it's another souvenir.
it's digital quality.
can't be that old.
there's a void in the blood spatter pattern.
it's a blowback shadow. Somebody else was there.
all ads have to be placed in person at the "China Weekly Post."
this ad was placed a week ago by a white male in his 20s or early 30s.
a week ago? This was highly premeditated.
the unsub kidnapped someone from the back of the cab.
that could be who the messages were for. Check with the cab dispatcher.
find out where the driver's last fare was picked up.
Morgan, see if there are any missing persons in that neighborhood.
JJ and I can look for ATM and other surveillance cameras near the newspaper.
what do you have, Garcia? Precious information.
the little boy in the photo, his name is Robbie Shaw, he disappeared from Mill Valley in 2000 and no suspects were ever identified.
ready for a wild time?
I can't believe you're taking me to Vegas.
I'm unavoidable for 48 hours.
I told you I was sorry.
I'm kidding.
Hey, you're a big shot now.
you could be, too, you know.
I'm not like you.
Marisa thinks you're great.
but clearly she prefers you.
where are you going? The airport's the other way. Change of plans.
got it.
the cabdriver's last fare was in the Marina district, the 500 block of Chestnut.
lots of bars, restaurants, shops there.
Garcia says nobody's been reported missing in the area.
passengers from the Marina, they'd be young, educated, well-to-do.
what's he doing? We've been thinking about this case too linearly.
based on the complexity of the code, it's obvious this unsub is operating on several different levels, so we need to start thinking in multiple dimensions.
where are we?
this is our old Zodiac book.
he's back.
he murdered two Berkeley students over there the other night.
I know.
did you look for ciphers? You still read the "Chronicle," don't you?
no. Marisa prefers the "Examiner."
what are we doing here?
remember... How we thought we could catch the Zodiac?
we were obsessed with the idea.
we were 12.
exactly.
we were kids. But we can catch him now.
you know the police won't find him.
come on, Caleb. Give it a try.
for old times' sake.
so, you're the Zodiac.
maybe you stalked this couple or you waited at the bottom of the hill for the right victims to come by.
can we make this quick?
well, that's up to you.
I'd be wearing a regular jacket, covering up my Zodiac hoodie.
no one who saw you would think twice.
I'd sneak up on them through the trees...
drop the jacket...
and pull out my gun.
Hey. We went through all the surveillance footage near the newspaper. There's nothing.
Spence, you ok? Nothing is accidental.
nothing this unsub does is accidental.
the message in the "China Weekly Post" was on page F-4.
why F-4?
that's where the classifieds were. It's more than that.
I stab him, then I go to her.
and you turn her over because you want her to see you.
No! Please!
I get off on her terror.
I want to see her face as I destroy her.
admit it.
you're having fun.
I'm being a good sport.
what do you think Marisa would think of this?
she'd find it strange, but so would anyone.
you think you two are really right for each other?
I'd park there under the trees so I could leave quickly.
can you rotate that?
see, F-4 is a chess square.
he murdered people according to a chess game?
specifically game 6 of Fischer versus Spassky in 1972, one of the greatest chess matches ever played.
the murder locations correspond with the final 3 moves of the game.
Garcia's lair of knowledge and wisdom.
Garcia, you have the list of Zodiac case experts? Yes. Standing by for you.
I have everyone who's ever written or blogged about it.
FYI, there are way too many people obsessed with this sicko.
all right, cross-reference that with professional chess players.
Oh, that totally helps. Yeah. Ok.
list is getting smaller and smaller...
down to nothing. All right, open it up to high-level amateurs as well.
OK.
I'm feeling dissatisfied now.
I need something more than another couple to kill.
the opening moves are done. It's time for the middle game.
exactly.
I'm hungry for a capture.
the cabdriver is just a sacrifice.
to throw off the opponent?
I kill him because what I really want...
is his passenger.
brilliant.
so where is the passenger?
I have a car, so I can go anywhere.
unbelievable.
crack team of investigators missed something.
what, did I drop this?
of course not. I planted it.
because that's the game I play.
go ahead, Garcia. Get ready to love me more.
I did a search of chess players rated 2, 200 or higher, which would make them Masters but not necessarily professionals.
I cross-referenced that search with Zodiac experts and came up with two former chess prodigies and best friends who used to write about the Zodiac in their junior high school newspaper.
and I get bonus points because they both have I. Q.S over 160.
where are they? - In San Francisco.
Caleb Rossmore is a city parks employee.
Harvey Morell is an engineer at a Chinese computer firm.
he's about to get married, and, yes, I just emailed you all this information right now.
the fianc√©e Marisa Devon looks like the two female victims.
they were surrogates for her.
Caleb could be jealous of his friend.
or what if he's afraid of losing Harvey?
if he was a child prodigy, he may no longer feel special as an adult.
he could be trying to hold on to him. Harvey's engagement could have been a trigger.
Reid, I know Spassky conceded the match, but what would the next move have been?
Spassky would have been checkmated or he would have lost his Queen.
lock's broken.
so, where would you hide the passenger?
over here.
Spassky's Queen was in square E-8, so that would land us in Richmond.
Garcia, is there a connection between that location and the two men?
checking now. Uh...
bingo. Harvey's dad worked there as a chemistry teacher in the sixties.
and... Oh, uh, Caleb lived there in 2008.
he worked at the Powerlinks Gym on Second and Hill and the Dragon Temple Restaurant at 636 Mason.
all right. JJ, you go to the gym. We'll check out the restaurant.
copy that.
Zablonsky's wife recognized the photos of Caleb and Harvey.
they interviewed the detective for an article they were writing about the Zodiac when they were kids.
they wrote a crime beat column in the newspaper.
one of them stole the photo left at the first crime scene.
it had to be Caleb. The message, "You could do so much better" in the Chinese paper was meant for Harvey.
that means the original spam message was for him, too.
but how did Caleb know that Harvey wouldn't turn him in?
Caleb has something on him or he's holding the fianc√©e hostage.
shut the front door.
they were interviewed by police in 2000 about a crime in their hometown.
you did this. Why?
are you hurt? - No.
we don't need her. Are you insane? I love her!
do you even know her?
she doesn't know you.
she's an inferior being, Harvey. She's a good person.
she is an imbecile!
how you ended up with her has confounded me from day one.
she'll never understand you like I do.
you've lost your mind.
why do things have to change? Grow up, Caleb!
we couldn't keep doing the same things forever.
why not? I know you had fun tonight.
almost as much fun as what we did when we were 15.
he didn't tell you, did he?
that's Caleb's car.
they're in the back.
if it's a hostage situation, Caleb's not going to be easily talked down.
shut up, Caleb.
we murdered little Robbie Shaw.
how old was he, Harvey, 7? He's lying.
it was such a thrill.
remember? - Harv?
don't listen to him. Forget about her.
I did all this to save you, from a life of misery, of pretending to be somebody you're not.
U murdered all those people to save me?!
stop being so sanctimonious! It doesn't suit you.
now... Do you want to kill her or should I?
you know that's how the game has to end. This isn't a game.
if we get rid of her now, we'll be long gone before she's found.
and the police won't catch us because the murders were perfect.
just like Robbie Shaw. Not really.
if they were perfect, I probably wouldn't be here right now.
I had nothing to do with this.
you really went out of your way to impress Harvey, Caleb.
the murders, the chess game, all designed to entice him.
Yes. He is pathological.
I don't know if Harvey's the best friend in the world to be selling you out like that.
I mean, after you killed Robbie Shaw together, you probably thought that you guys had an unbreakable bond.
he murdered Robbie by himself.
when we took him into the woods and strangled him...
I've never seen you so exhilarated.
the look on your face, you can't deny that, Harvey.
but afterwards, something changed.
you two grew apart.
I wasn't there.
you pulled away from me.
do you know how much that hurt?
I would have done anything for you, Harvey.
I looked up to you.
you know what I think, Harvey?
I think killing Robbie Shaw was your idea.
no.
you chose him because his brother used to pick on you in school.
you're successful, you're charismatic, you're dominant, which means that you most likely made the plans and Caleb followed them.
let me ask you this-- where did you hide the body?
listen to me
if I was gonna kill somebody and hide a body,
I think I would probably use sulfuric acid.
especially if my father was a chemistry teacher.
right, Caleb? Caleb...
don't listen to him. He's trying to trick us.
do you trust him, Caleb?
Caleb! Hey, Caleb!
whatever happens, we'll protect each other.
Oh, I'm sure that he'll protect you if he's around.
I mean, he is moving to Shanghai in a couple of months.
he put the transfer in about a year ago.
did you--did your good friend Harvey not tell you about that?
well, I'm sure that he'll send you a postcard.
I was going to tell you.
Robbie's bones are buried in his backyard.
let's go.
there is no greater sorrow than to recall in misery the time when we were happy.
Dante.
Hey, Reid.
um, Hotch wants to talk to you.
what's wrong?
he probably wants to talk to me about why I've been kind of weird lately.
you are making a difference, you know, one person at a time.
thank you.
you know, I've been thinking a lot lately about why I stayed after Gideon left, why I didn't take any of those other offers.
nothing is accidental.
and I realized, I don't know, there's just something incredibly right about being here, with you guys.
well, I'm glad to hear that.
otherwise this would have been really awkward.
what would have been really awkward?
happy Birthday! Surprise! Surprise!
happy Birthday!
happy Birthday!
do you feel like 30?
Ohh! Happy Birthday, old man.
happy Birthday.
I'm getting close. Almost 40 now.
I don't like it here.
it's scary.
let's get out of here.
in a minute.
seriously.
I'm getting creeped out.
will you relax.
Oh, my God.
what's he doing?
who is that?
maybe it's the Park Service.
it was no one.
or was it the Iron Claw killer?
it's not funny.
let's get out of here.
that takes us back to 1968.
you're listening to your classic rock station in the Bay.
in the end, I just write about violent crime.
the real heroes are the people here beside me.
now give a warm welcome to our next speaker, Dr. Spencer Reid of the BAU.
thank you. Thanks.
Patricia Cornwell, ladies and gentlemen.
ms. Cornwell will be signing books at the end of the session.
sorry. Um...
I am here today to talk to you about paraphilias and their relation to violent crime.
does anybody know what dendrophilia is?
Yes, a fetish for trees.
thank you so much for coming out, you guys, and as for your question earlier, the case that we were following at the time was the David Parker Ray case.
we actually believed that the victim count in that case was close to 60.
unfortunately, we were only able to unearth 45 bodies, but SSA Buffalino, um, has been diligent...
Dr. Reid?
Hey, you were fantastic up there.
thank you.
Yeah. I love the names of those paraphilias.
I have a new list to memorize.
you like memorizing lists?
I'm weird that way.
that's not weird at all. I do it all the time.
you know, we don't usually get people your age here.
you're in school, I assume?
Yeah, I'm a senior at Michigan.
you know what? You might like the FBI's internship program.
unfortunately, we're already past the deadline, but if you write me a letter, I might be able to pull some strings.
Uh...Thanks. But I don't think my Board of Directors would allow it.
I have a company.
have you heard of Nanovex?
Nanovex, as in the company Land is Pharmaceuticals investing 100 million dollars in, Nanovex?
it's not a done deal yet.
uh, but, hey, you were awesome up there.
you saved me from accompany party downstairs that was a total snooze fest.
keep up the good work.
you, too.
who was that?
that was the founder of Nanovex.
I've never heard of it.
they make magnetically responsive nano particles for targeted drudge livery to tumor cells.
I've still never heard of it.
you will. It's gonna change the world.
guess who's back.
the Marin head lands last night.
david Atley and Nicole Puli, both 24, both grad students at Berkeley, shot multiple times in their vehicle-wait for it.
the Zodiac?
no way.
come on, it's gotta be the 2. 0 version.
Yeah, you would think so, except for the crazy similarities in the M. O.
I'm talking same victimology, same geography.
and two souvenirs were left at the crime scene.
he left a photo?
local police say that is Marcia Miller. She was found near Napain 1971.
strongly suspected that she was a victim of the Zodiac, but police never confirmed it and they didn't publicize the case.
so the Zodiactook this photo at the killing and then saved it all these years?
the Zodiac's last confirmed victim was the cab driver Paul Stine.
he mailed pieces of Stine's bloody shirt along with his letters to prove it was him.
this photo could prove he's back.
Oh...You just mentioned a bloody shirt?
this is the second souvenir that was left at the crime scene.
preliminary tests say that the blood type is O-negative.
same blood type as the cab driver.
so how old would Zodiac be by now?
the murders took place in the late sixties? - Yeah.
uh, December 20, 1968, to October 11, 1969, to be exact, but he was suspected of other crimes, and he sent letters and codes to newspapers until 1974.
well, at the very least, the Zodiac would have to be about 60 by now.
but it doesn't take a lot of strength to pull a trigger.
no, but it takes a lot of skill not to get caught for 40 years.
have Reid and Prentiss meet us in San Francisco.
Yes, sir.
"three can keep a secret if two are dead." Benjamin Franklin.
bottom line is Zodiacis the most well-documented unsolved serial killing case in modern times.
there have been two known copycats.
correct. The first one was Heriberto Seda.
he killed 3 and wounded 4 in New York City.
and then there was a 14-year-old in Japan named Saito Sakakibara.
he killed two other children and left the sign of the Zodiac behind.
the fact is, the Zodiac was driven by a need for notoriety and control.
he enjoyed the terror he spread through the city.
well, then he stopped.
after his last letter in '74, he vanished.
most likely wound up in a prison or a mental hospital.
maybe he was just released and picked up where he left off.
I will search for anyone recently freed or discharged after 40 years.
it's a long time to be dormant with no evolution in the M. O.
agreed.
even a serial killer has to grow up.
check.
check.
checkmate.
Hey, Caleb, what the hell?
break time's over.
it's Harvey. Leave a message.
agent Hotchner? - Yes.
I'm Agent Lin. - Nice to meet you. This is Agent Jareau.
we're setting you up in the city field office.
all the Zodiac data has been sent over from local P. D.s.
good. That avoids jurisdiction issues.
according to the M. E. David Atley was shot twice in the head.
Nicole Puli was shot 13 times in the face, torso, and back.
weapon was a 9-millimeter.
overkill on the female.
the Zodiac did the same thing.
he also used a 9-millimeter.
we're examining ballistics for a match.
take look over here.
we I. D. these as military Wing-Walker boots.
let me guess. Size 10 1/2.
just like the prints found at Lake Berryessa in '69.
what makes you think this is the real Zodiac, Agent?
the M. O. is uncannily similar.
if it's not him, then it's an equally evil twin.
or someone who's studied him meticulously.
have any letters or ciphers been received?
agent Lin, this is Dr. Reid, Agent Prentiss.
how was the conference?
enlightening.
Prentiss: Has the unsub made any contact?
the "Chronicle's "website manager received two phone calls this morning.
there was just heavy breathing on the other end.
like the phone calls Zodiac used to make.
can I get a physical copy of the online version of today's paper?
you want a print out of the online version?
Yeah. With all the comments printed out as well, if possible, thanks.
don't ask.
it's not the real Zodiac.
how can you be so sure?
I just know it.
sometimes I can't really explain it.
he hasn't had a visitor in ages.
he used to get so many when he was with the Napa P. D.
these people are from the FBI.
Hello, Detective.
we're Agents Rossi and Morgan.
he has Parkinson's.
this is one of the bad days.
well, ma'am, maybe you could help us out.
it won't take very long.
this is about the Zodiac, isn't it?
I've been watching the news.
did Bob ever talk about his work?
that's all he talked about.
I tried to move his old boxes out, but he got so agitated, I had to bring them back.
do you mind if we take a look?
help yourself.
excuse me, I have to get his medication.
wow, she wasn't kidding when she said he liked to surround himself with his work.
these are all about Marcia Miller, who died in '71 and possibly killed by Zodiac.
Rossi, these are crime scene photos.
take a look at this.
Marcia Miller's photo could have come from this batch.
you know, a guy this obsessed with work probably used his own camera.
detective, did you take these pictures yourself at the crime scene?
now, you can blink once for yes and twice for no.
did you take these?
sir, is it possible that someone could have come in here and stolen one?
do you know who?
Mrs. Zablonsky, you said your husband used to get a lot of visitors?
Oh, yes. They were all people obsessed with the Zodiac.
well, do you think you can write down the names of all those that you remember?
the dates match.
when Zodiac stopped killing, my cousin was put in a mental hospital in Mexico.
he was released 2 months ago.
do you have anything more specific?
he was working on a production of "The Mikado" in '68.
the Zodiac talked about "The Mikado" in a letter.
excuse me. I'm Dr. Reid with the Behavioral Analysis Unit.
was your cousin by chance a fan of Wagner?
because a CD of the "Tragic Overture" was sent to the police this morning.
he loved Wagner, especially the "Tragic Overture."
it's him. - Oh, yeah.
well, for the record, a CD was not sent to the police this morning, and the "Tragic Overture" was written by Brahms, not Wagner, so luckily, I guess it's not your cousin.
the FBI would greatly appreciate it if people would stop making false claims to get their 15 minutes of fame.
thank you. Thank you very much.
well, this is quite a surprise development we just witnessed outside the San Francisco FBI building.
we'll have more for you later.
reporting live for Action News, back to you in the studio.
the best news is that when Harvey goes on his honeymoon, the rest of us will get two weeks of not looking so stupid at work.
seriously, it's a real honor to be your best man.
you and Marisa are perfect for each other, and I wish you all the happiness in the world.
Congrats. Enjoy the party.
Cheers.
excuse me.
I'd like to say something.
if I could direct your attention to the screen.
so that's me.
if you think I was funny-looking, you should have seen Harvey.
I met Harvey at the finals of the class "A" regional chess tournament.
I annihilated him.
but he still became my best friend.
I finally found someone else who was a child prodigy and a playground punching bag, too.
we became inseparable because of our shared love of Chess.
and some other weird stuff, right, Harv?
we liked animal dissection and Roman history and crime journalism.
thank you. Thank you, Caleb- Almost finished.
I didn't see Harvey as much after high school, but we always had a special connection.
I thought I knew him so well.
but I was completely shocked when I found out he was engaged to Marisa.
mainly because I couldn't believe the hot chick we both had a crush on in Junior High actually said yes to him.
anyway, buddy, I'll wrap it up.
your soul mate is standing before you now.
in the words of Plautus, let us celebrate with wine and sweet words.
that was so sweet.
I almost cried. - Thanks, man.
listen, uh, I'm sorry. I've been such a dead beat friend.
I owe you a call.
Yeah, I'm getting used to the radio silence.
I'm sorry.
I have something for you.
I know it's normally the best man's job, but I asked if I could do it.
a ticket to Vegas.
for your bachelor party weekend.
I'm picking you up tomorrow at 6: 00.
Thanks, man, but I...
I can't do a whole weekend.
I just have too much work.
I thought it was one night.
Harvey, you have to go.
you're only getting married once.
Yes, ma'am.
terrific.
the detective's wife couldn't remember many names.
that's all right. We'll show her photos when we have a suspect.
I talked to Nicole Puli's mother.
it doesn't seem she was stalked.
lab results are back on the piece of fabric.
the DNA doesn't match the original cab driver.
and the cloth is fairly new.
it was distressed to look old.
guess I was foolish to think it was the real Zodiac.
well, he went to great pains to make us think it was him.
and he was criminally sophisticated enough to pull it off.
the question is why.
Reid, how's it going?
computers slow me down, so I prefer paper, but I wasn't expecting all these comments.
where do people find the time?
I think I just found a cipher from the unsub.
the symbols buried in the spam are the same ones the Zodiac used in his first message back in 1969.
what does it say?
killing is the most fun you can have 98 minutes below the horizon in magic city with President Garfield. Happy hunting.
the oracle is in. How may I assist?
Garcia, to what specific location does magic city refer?
birmingham, Alabama.
98 minutes below the horizon.
Garcia, what time is sunset there, tonight?
6: 22. - 98 minutes there would be 8 p. m.
what's dedicated to President Garfield in San Francisco?
president Garfield...
there's a statue of him in Golden Gate Park.
no one at the south entrance yet.
copy that.
we've got a vehicle.
it's a lone driver.
move in.
FBI. Show me your hands.
drop it.
I'm just the messenger.
I'm supposed to deliver a letter.
it's for Reid.
you're not as smart as you think you are.
who sent it?
I don't know.
I just deliver it to the address when I'm supposed to.
if the unsub's not here, where is he?
please, take the money.
Ohh...Do it. Please.
please don't hurt us, please. Please!
Tara Hanson was a teacher.
Alec Wyseck was a lawyer.
they had dinner at a nearby restaurant and were taking an evening stroll.
the M. E. said Alec's throat was slit and he was stabbed twice in the back.
Tara was stabbed 20 times in the abdomen and torso.
overkill on the female again.
she's a brunette, like Nicole Puli.
they both could have been surrogates.
he left this on the park bench.
it's Nicole's.
her nickname was Kiki.
the courier service said the envelope was left with cash in their drop box.
the messenger himself had a clean record.
he's a star employee.
this was a targeted message for an individual. Very different M. O.
it's a high vantage point.
the victims chose it for the view, the unsub so he could see if anyone was coming.
Hey, what's up?
Hey, boo, I tracked the ISP of the user who entered the spam comment to an Internet cafe, but he used a prepaid credit card, so I don't have an I. D.
all right, thanks, Garcia.
he used the same code that was broken years ago in a riddle we cracked in seconds.
he knew we'd solve it. It was a decoy.
no, it's a taunt.
he wants to prove that he's smarter than everyone.
and we fell for it.
well, if he's trying to compete with me, then it means he's most likely within 5 years of my age.
the question is why.
but the message might not have been meant for you, Reid.
a letter was hand-delivered to me last night.
the comment to the paper was written at 9: 03 a. m.
we weren't even in the city yet, so how would the unsub know you'd be involved in the case?
you did give your name to the press later that day, and you said yourself he knew we'd be in the park.
if he's doing his best to emulate the Zodiac, killing in such quick succession would be a mistake.
the shortest time span for a Zodiac was two weeks?
maybe the unsub doesn't have a choice.
maybe he's experiencing a time pressure that he has no control over.
we're ready to give the profile.
unlike the real Zodiac, whose goal was mass hysteria, this copycat's message is directed at an individual woman with whom he's obsessed.
the women that he's killed so far have been surrogates for her.
he was either rejected or believes that he can't have her, so he feels a rage towards this woman and any man that she's with.
his actions may be an attempt to impress the object of his obsession or prove his love.
the unsub chose to copy the Zodiac because he wants to feel as brilliant, famous, and powerful as his predecessor.
you should be looking for a physically fit male in his 20s to 30s.
he's highly intelligent, but he holds a menial or low-level job.
he has few friends and fantasizes of a world in which he feels special.
and the frequency of the kills suggests that he may be on the verge of losing the object of his obsession.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Hey, how are you?
are you ok?
I need to talk to you about Harvey.
look, if you need to call off the wedding, everyone will understand.
what are you talking about?
you were upset when you called.
and you said it was about Harvey.
no. I had a fight with my mom.
I wanted to talk to you about my surprise for Harvey.
a surprise?
a man cave.
it will be installed over our honeymoon.
I got a 60-inch flat screen, a fridge for beer, but I need a "wow" item, like an air hockey table or a mini putting green.
are you serious?
Yeah. What do you think he'd like?
I'm leaning towards the air hockey table, but I- Marisa, stop.
please, just stop.
do you even know Harvey?
he'd hate it.
most guys like it, but he's weird. Trust me.
I'm just being honest.
and now you hate me.
no, I don't.
I always say all the wrong things, especially around you.
I really just want you to like me.
I've always wanted that.
I do like you.
look, I gotta run.
I have so much wedding stuff to do.
order more flowers, I have another dress fitting at 2: 00, pick up gifts.
thank you.
I'll see you later.
are you gonna tell me what's up?
Reid, it's me.
do you even wonder if you lived up to expectations?
Mm...I beat them.
I figured I'd be a bored socialite by 25.
I thought I'd cure schizophrenia by the time I was 25.
you know, when I was a kid, people told me that I could do anything.
you're afraid you've let people down?
no, I'm afraid I've let myself down.
by not curing schizophrenia?
no, just because...
I don't know why I'm in the FBI.
I see.
you're a genius, but you have the same job as me, Morgan, JJ.
Yeah, exactly.
no, that's not what I'm saying.
it's just sometimes-sometimes I kind of get this feeling like
like maybe I should have done something more with my life.
how old are you? 29.
I'm 30. - No way.
we missed your birthday?
Well-why didn't you tell us?
the fact of the matter is you're young.
there's still time.
by the time Nicola Tesla was 30, he'd already invented the induction motor.
you know what?
you might be right.
you don't hear that much about child prodigies once they grow up.
in fact, most of them turn out average.
that's not true.
are you trying reverse psychology with me?
I'm just telling it like it is.
what are you doing?
well, you just told me yourself you're washed up.
I should take a look at this.
that's not what I'm saying.
It's-seriously, what are you doing?
I'm just looking to see what you missed.
don't do--you're gonna actually mess it up.
Emily-- give it back.
wait a minute, that's it.
the real code is in the words.
"china Weekly Post," page F-4.
the spam had to be converted from matrix code to binary code, then switched to base 8 before being translated back into letters.
I can go into more detail if you want.
uh, no. How smart would a person have to be to write code like that?
beyond smart. Profoundly gifted. An I.Q. Of at least 160.
that changes the profile, then.
the unsub could still hold a menial or low-level job.
many believe that beyond an I. Q. Of 120, success is determined by other factors.
this is a bilingual paper.
the English version should be somewhere.
Garcia, I need you to compile a list of people with I. Q.s of 160 or above in the region.
checking with the Bay Area Mensa Society.
which is kind of slumming it, 'cause folks can get in with a measly I. Q. Of 130.
also check old school records. We're looking for someone who's in his 20s or 30s.
Yeah. Hit you back when I got something.
all right.
all right, this is it.
you could do some much better.
I'll talk to the manager, see if they know who placed the ad.
who's this message for?
the writer's a genius, but the recipient would have to be, too, in order to decode it.
Yeah, Dave.
all right.
a cabdriver's just been murdered.
in broad daylight, with no witnesses.
the engine was still running.
what, was he dropping the unsub off?
in '69, Zodiac killed the cabdriver from the backseat.
but this driver was shot from outside.
look at this.
it's another souvenir.
it's digital quality.
can't be that old.
there's a void in the blood spatter pattern.
it's a blowback shadow.
somebody else was there.
all ads have to be placed in person at the "China Weekly Post."
this ad was placed a week ago by a white male in his 20s or early 30s.
a week ago? This was highly premeditated.
the unsub kidnapped someone from the back of the cab.
that could be who the messages were for.
check with the cab dispatcher. Find out where the driver's last fare was picked up.
Morgan, see if there are any missing persons in that neighborhood.
JJ and I can look for ATM and other surveillance cameras near the newspaper.
what do you have, Garcia?
precious information.
the little boy in the photo, his name is Robbie Shaw, he disappeared from Mill Valley in 2000 and no suspects were ever identified.
ready for a wild time?
I can't believe you're taking me to Vegas.
I'm unavoidable for 48 hours.
I told you I was sorry.
I'm kidding.
Hey, you're a big shot now.
you could be, too, you know.
I'm not like you.
Marisa thinks you're great.
but clearly she prefers you.
where are you going? The airport's the other way.
change of plans.
got it.
the cab driver's last fare was in the Marina district, the 500 block of Chestnut.
lots of bars, restaurants, shops there.
Garcia says nobody's been reported missing in the area.
passengers from the Marina, they'd be young, educated, well-to-do.
what's he doing?
we've been thinking about this case too linearly.
based on the complexity of the code, it's obvious this unsub is operating on several different levels, so we need to start thinking in multiple dimensions.
where are we?
this is our old Zodiac book.
he's back.
he murdered two Berkeley students over there the other night.
I know.
did you look for ciphers?
you still read the "Chronicle," don't you?
no. Marisa prefers the "Examiner."
what are we doing here?
remember...
how we thought we could catch the Zodiac?
we were obsessed with the idea.
we were 12.
exactly.
we were kids.
but we can catch him now.
you know the police won't find him.
come on, Caleb.
give it a try.
for old times' sake.
so, you're the Zodiac.
maybe you stalked this couple or you waited at the bottom of the hill for the right victims to come by.
can we make this quick?
well, that's up to you.
I'd be wearing a regular jacket, covering up my Zodiac hoodie.
no one who saw you would think twice.
I'd sneak up on them through the trees...
drop the jacket...
and pull out my gun.
we went through all the surveillance footage near the newspaper.
there's nothing.
Spence, you ok?
nothing is accidental.
nothing this unsub does is accidental.
the message in the "China Weekly Post" was on page F-4.
why F-4?
that's where the classifieds were.
it's more than that.
I stab him, then I go to her.
and you turn her over because you want her to see you.
No! Please!
I get off on her terror.
I want to see her face as I destroy her.
admit it. You're having fun.
I'm being a good sport.
what do you think Marisa would think of this?
she'd find it strange, but so would anyone.
you think you two are really right for each other?
I'd park there under the trees so I could leave quickly.
can you rotate that?
see, F-4 is a chess square.
he murdered people according to a chess game?
specifically game 6 of Fischer versus Spassky in 1972, one of the greatest chess matches ever played.
the murder locations correspond with the final 3 moves of the game.
Garcia's lair of knowledge and wisdom.
Garcia, you have the list of Zodiac case experts?
Yes. Standing by for you.
I have everyone who's ever written or blogged about it.
FYI, there are way too many people obsessed with this sicko.
all right, cross-reference that with professional chess players.
Oh, that totally helps. Yeah. Ok.
list is getting smaller and smaller...
down to nothing.
all right, open it up to high-level amateurs as well.
OK.
I'm feeling dissatisfied now.
I need something more than another couple to kill.
the opening moves are done.
it's time for the middle game.
exactly.
I'm hungry for a capture.
the cab driver is just a sacrifice.
to throw off the opponent?
I kill him because what I really want...
is his passenger.
brilliant.
so where is the passenger?
I have a car, so I can go anywhere.
unbelievable.
crack team of investigators missed something.
what, did I drop this?
of course not.
I planted it.
because that's the game I play.
go ahead, Garcia.
get ready to love me more.
I did a search of chess players rated 2, 200 or higher, which would make them Masters but not necessarily professionals.
I cross-referenced that search with Zodiac experts and came up with two former chess prodigies and best friends who used to write about the Zodiac in their junior high school newspaper.
and I get bonus points because they both have I. Q.S over 160.
where are they? - In San Francisco.
Caleb Rossmore is a city parks employee.
Harvey Morell is an engineer at a Chinese computer firm.
he's about to get married, and, yes, I just emailed you all this information right now.
the fiancee Marisa Devon looks like the two female victims.
they were surrogates for her.
Caleb could be jealous of his friend.
or what if he's afraid of losing Harvey?
if he was a child prodigy, he may no longer feel special as an adult.
he could be trying to hold on to him.
Harvey's engagement could have been a trigger.
Reid, I know Spassky conceded the match, but what would the next move have been?
Spassky would have been check mated or he would have lost his Queen.
lock's broken.
so, where would you hide the passenger?
over here.
Spassky's Queen was in square E-8, so that would land us in Richmond.
Garcia, is there a connection between that location and the two men?
checking now.
uh... Bingo.
Harvey's dad worked there as a chemistry teacher in the sixties.
and. Oh, uh, Caleb lived there in 2008.
he worked at the Power links Gym on Second and Hill and the Dragon Temple Restaurant at 636 Mason.
all right. JJ, you go to the gym.
we'll check out the restaurant.
copy that.
Zablonsky's wife recognized the photos of Caleb and Harvey.
they interviewed the detective for an article they were writing about the Zodiac when they were kids.
they wrote a crime beat column in the newspaper.
one of them stole the photo left at the first crime scene.
it had to be Caleb.
the message, "You could do so much better" in the Chinese paper was meant for Harvey.
that means the original spam message was for him, too.
but how did Caleb know that Harvey wouldn't turn him in?
Caleb has something on him or he's holding the fiancee hostage.
shut the front door.
they were interviewed by police in 2000 about a crime in their hometown.
you did this.
Why?
are you hurt? - No.
we don't need her.
are you insane? I love her!
do you even know her?
she doesn't know you.
she's an inferior being, Harvey.
she's a good person.
she is an imbecile!
how you ended up with her has confounded me from day one.
she'll never understand you like I do.
you've lost your mind.
why do things have to change?
grow up, Caleb!
we couldn't keep doing the same things forever.
why not?
I know you had fun tonight.
almost as much fun as what we did when we were 15.
he didn't tell you, did he?
that's Caleb's car.
they're in the back.
if it's a hostage situation, Caleb's not going to be easily talked down.
shut up, Caleb.
we murdered little Robbie Shaw.
how old was he, Harvey, 7?
he's lying.
it was such a thrill.
remember? - Harv?
don't listen to him.
forget about her.
I did all this to save you, from a life of misery, of pretending to be somebody you're not.
U murdered all those people to save me?!
stop being so sanctimonious! It doesn't suit you.
now...
do you want to kill her or should I?
you know that's how the game has to end.
this isn't a game.
if we get rid of her now, we'll be long gone before she's found.
and the police won't catch us because the murders were perfect.
just like Robbie Shaw.
not really.
if they were perfect, I probably wouldn't be here right now.
I had nothing to do with this.
you really went out of your way to impress Harvey, Caleb.
the murders, the chess game, all designed to entice him.
Yes. He is pathological.
I don't know if Harvey's the best friend in the world to be selling you out like that.
I mean, after you killed Robbie Shaw together, you probably thought that you guys had an unbreakable bond.
he murdered Robbie by himself.
when we took him into the woods and strangled him...
I've never seen you so exhilarated.
the look on your face, you can't deny that, Harvey.
but afterwards, something changed.
you two grew apart.
I wasn't there.
you pulled away from me.
do you know how much that hurt?
I would have done anything for you, Harvey.
I looked up to you.
you know what I think, Harvey?
I think killing Robbie Shaw was your idea.
no.
you chose him because his brother used to pick on you in school.
you're successful, you're charismatic, you're dominant, which means that you most likely made the plans and Caleb followed them.
let me ask you this-where did you hide the body?
listen to me- if I was gonna kill somebody and hide a body,
I think I would probably use sulfuric acid.
especially if my father was a chemistry teacher.
right, Caleb?
don't listen to him.
he's trying to trick us.
do you trust him, Caleb?
whatever happens, we'll protect each other.
Oh, I'm sure that he'll protect you if he's around.
I mean, he is moving to Shanghai in a couple of months.
he put the transfer in about a year ago.
did you-did your good friend Harvey not tell you about that?
well, I'm sure that he'll send you a postcard.
I was going to tell you.
Robbie's bones are buried in his backyard.
let's go.
"there is no greater sorrow than to recall in misery the time when we were happy." Dante.
um, Hotch wants to talk to you.
what's wrong?
he probably wants to talk to me about why I've been kind of weird lately.
you are making a difference, you know, one person at a time.
thank you.
you know, I've been thinking a lot lately about why I stayed after Gideon left, why I didn't take any of those other offers.
nothing is accidental.
and I realized, I don't know, there's just something incredibly right about being here,
well, I'm glad to hear that.
otherwise this would have been really awkward.
what would have been really awkward?
happy Birthday!
surprise! Surprise!
happy Birthday! Happy Birthday!
happy Birthday, old man.
happy Birthday.
atlantic CITY, NJ
not done!
if this is a sales call on a Sunday morning...
settle. It's me, JJ.
I tried your cell. Listen, something's come up.
you need to get down to the office pronto.
Oh. You are kidding.
I know. I wish psychopathic killers would be a little more respectful of our weekends, too, but what are you gonna do? Is everything ok?
um, no.
Kevin and I got in a fight last night, and to self soothe, I drank a lot of wine.
and, JJ, you know I can't drink wine.
why did I drink so much wine? You'll be fine.
no, I don't know. 'Cause right now everything is blurring. Oh, my God.
my hair hurts. How is that possible? He's coming out of the shower.
I hate confrontation. It was such a fight. I hate confrontation. Then don't confront.
just kiss, make up, and get your butt over here.
what is this, Grand Central Station?
Oh, God.
Kevin. I am so sorry about last night.
I should not have stormed out like that.
you stormed out? Yeah.
you stormed out all last night?
Yeah.
what's, uh
Hey. You see we gotta go in, right?
Yes. Y-yes.
uh, JJ just called me, too. Let's go.
my things.
mine and mine and
this is yours. This is mine.
see you there.
Hey, let's go.
Danny Savino, the floor manager at the Sapphire Lady casino in Atlantic City was found dead in his office this morning.
blunt force trauma to the head.
an empty wallet and money clip left next to the body.
mug shot. This guy's got a record.
Savino was a member of the Agnoli crime family.
sorry. Sorry. They're active in the Atlantic City area.
how's the head? Not all the aspirins in all the pharmacies...
it looks like a robbery gone bad.
why was the BAU called in? 8 one-dollar bills surrounding an 8 card.
that's highly ritualistic.
and because Savino has ties to organized crime, agents in New Jersey are worried about things escalating.
well, it doesn't take much to ignite a mob war.
and collateral damage means nothing to these guys.
if we don't get a handle on this soon, innocent people are gonna die.
Hey, honey, it's me.
listen, the most amazing thing is happening.
I'm at the Sapphire Lady right now, and I am on a run you would not believe.
everything we ever talked about, it's gonna happen.
I'll try you again later, ok, Honey? Bye.
a Chinese proverb says, "at the gambling table, there are no fathers and sons.
no question. "Godfather II," hands down.
no, no, gotta be "Scarface.
for me, "The Untouchables." Spence?
mm, probably "Le Cercle Rouge," the 1970s French classic.
but "Den Tredje Vaagan" is definitely a close second. Yeah, that was my runner-up, too.
what about you, Rossi? Best ever gangster flick.
I've had too much of the real thing to be a fan of mob movies.
Garcia, did we get the crime scene surveillance video yet? No, sir, because there wasn't any.
that's not possible.
every inch of the casino is surveilled every minute of every day.
Yeah. Apparently the footage was tampered with, so... All right. Reid and Prentiss, go to the crime scene.
Dave, you and JJ find out if Savino was involved in anything the local authorities don't know about.
morgan and I will contact the local FBI office and arrange a ceasefire with the families.
Yes, sir, you're on the line.
there you go.
that's very good.
Yes! Yes! Yes!
it looks like the party's over here.
mind if I join? Hey. There you are.
Eddie! That's my man. There you are.
gee, Curtis. Those all yours? Oh, yes.
stay right here.
I've got plans with you.
Oh, you are on a hot streak.
too bad your old man couldn't see this, huh?
Hey, did you hear what happened last night?
Danny Savino got his head bashed in. He's dead.
didn't you two--you two did some business together, right?
you good to go? Not anymore. Yes, here we go.
Winner--8 the hard way!
Oh, yes!
thank you. You look a little strung out, man.
when's the last time you got some sleep? Oh, I don't know, man. A couple of days.
yeah? You would not believe what's been going on with me, man. It's crazy.
so I was headed up north for a job interview.
a job interview? What about the job you already got? Yeah. I got fired.
how come? I punched out my boss. All right?
but look, look, look. I stopped on the turnpike, I buy a scratcher.
bam! $250 instant winner.
so I jump in the car, I pop a u-turn, I come right back here.
come on.
so I walk in the casino, it happens again.
I put a dollar in the slot machine, $500 payout.
and now this. I am on the craziest roll. I'm telling you. -ÔºüÔºüÔºü
if I get the buy-in for that million-dollar poker tournament the day after tomorrow, I'm telling you, I could win that.
listen, I could win that. What have you been smoking? That's a 50-grand buy-in.
I hope you don't mind. I thought a little celebration was in order.
no, don't mind at all. Money well spent.
are we good to go? - Everyone ready?
trust me.
all right, let's go 500. All right, shooter. 8 the hard way again. -ALL READY.
you want me to blow on them?
pile on, everybody.
please.
come on, be good to me.
electric strike lock. Impressive.
and hard to bypass. If this was a robbery, the unsub must have slipped in right behind him.
but Savino could have known the killer. He could have let him in himself.
he wasn't expecting this to turn into a brawl. You know, maybe the unsub wasn't either.
if this was premeditated, you'd think he would have brought a knife or a gun with him.
the bowling trophy's more a weapon of opportunity.
is this the only camera? Yes, ma'am, but the disk was removed.
the casinos have a central terminal that backs up and stores all surveillance footage, right?
Mr. Savino didn't want that in his office. He put in a personal camera.
so the victim bypassed a security system that would have revealed his own killer.
what didn't he want anyone to see?
put your hands together for Ginger...
who's asking? Agent Jareau. This is Agent Rossi.
we're with the FBI.
we understand you've cooperated with the Bureau before when we've needed information.
before" being the operative word. I'm retired.
this is how you plan on spending your golden years?
what can I say?
some guys like to futz around with little golf carts, me, I love the ladies.
I hear ya.
me, I like to spend my time chatting with my old friends down at the New Jersey parole board.
listen, we just need you to come out of retirement long enough to tell us a little about Danny Savino.
he's dead now, so what the hell.
for 8 days and 7 nights of sheer heaven, afternoon massages on white sandy beaches, yes, you can win an all-expenses-paid trip to paradise.
but you can't win if you don't play.
but you already know that, don't you, Curtis?
you've dreamed of this your whole life.
most people don't understand, but you're not like most people, are you, Curtis? You don't think small.
you are not content with a small life.
all this is going to be yours, Curtis, for you and your wife.
you just need to maintain your focus.
don't waver.
it's right there, if you can just win.
what are you doing?
sorry, sweetheart, he's taken.
Really? I'm his wife.
all right, let's go. Come here. Come here. I'm winning, Teri.
I'm winning big.
you told me you were going to Philly.
I was. But I stumbled onto this system.
I don't really understand it myself yet-- every week you got a new system.
we can't pay the mortgage. The bank is foreclosing on us.
but this-- this system works.
there's a big poker tournament day after tomorrow.
million-dollar winner take all.
the streak I'm on right now, I could win that thing.
we'd be rich. And then I'm done.
I swear.
I want a divorce.
what?
I'm sorry.
I'm going to my sister's.
you--you show up here and you announce that?
you're hurting me, Curtis.
this is our dream. Yours and mine together.
you're hurting me.
stay away.
I mean it.
we appreciate your cooperation.
agent Goslin.
any luck with our mob bosses? Well, I think we bought some time.
what about the crime scene?
Savino purposely bypassed the standard casino security.
and I think we know why.
Danny Savino supplemented his income by loaning money to casino patrons.
it explains why he changed the camera in his office. He didn't want his bosses to know he was freelancing.
so we're looking for a gambler. A gambler in Atlantic City.
that narrows the field.
7 out.
you scared me.
sorry.
uh, we never got to finish that champagne.
pass.
I--I don't know what happened, but my luck is gonna turn around.
Yeah, well, when it does, give me a call.
maybe--maybe we could go somewhere and
I said no, ok?
we came up empty tonight, both of us. It happens.
I meant what I said about my luck turning around.
it's going to. I can sense it.
right. With that gambler's esp of yours.
you and all the other losers in this town.
Hey, what are you looking for?
discarded matches.
the victim had a freshly-lit cigarette.
but there was no lighter or matches in her purse or the car.
our unsub lit it for her. It means she wasn't afraid of him.
Hey, Garcia, you're on speaker.
Patti Riolo, aka Francesca.
hometown, Rice Lake, Wisconsin.
up until 3 years ago, she worked with a high-end escort service in Manhattan.
how high, you ask? I will tell you.
nosebleed high.
$5, 000 a night and up.
now she's trolling gaming tables in Atlantic City.
I imagine that 5 grand a night window was very short in her profession.
well, this is gonna turn into a circus real fast.
both residents and visitors to Atlantic City are on edge tonight as the Circle of 8 killer has apparently struck again.
no way. That's the hooker who was all over you last night.
they're saying the same guy killed Danny Savino.
you knew both victims. That's weird.
my bad luck must have rubbed off on them.
listen, you gotta forget about Teri.
she was holding you back.
every time she stuck her nose in things, your luck went cold.
Hey, you could win that million-dollar tournament and then go to Tahiti on your own, huh?
Yeah! Live your dreams, man.
you know where we spent our honeymoon? Where?
some half-assed motel in Florida.
went to a theme park.
teri deserves better than that.
I promised her we'd...
go to Tahiti.
I'm gonna show you something, man.
you carry around a picture of a watch?
you want something, you keep it close.
that's the dumbest thing I ever heard.
go ahead and make fun, but when I hit it big, that's the first thing I'm gonna do, is buy that watch I just showed you. Then I want to see your face.
come on, man, first one's on me.
make your own luck.
come on.
4 aces? Your mojo is back big time!
you make a deal with the devil or what?
winner, winner, chicken dinner.
we're looking for a man who's killing those who appear to prey upon or take advantage of gamblers.
loan sharks and call girls so far.
the killings may have been triggered by recent gambling losses.
our unsub is physically fit.
he was able to overpower Danny Savino, and Patti Riolo was killed with extreme violence.
it's doubtful this person has a criminal record.
he moves without fear of being recognized in one of the most surveilled locales on the planet.
he wouldn't have elements of a domestic life, like children.
that would only moderate or stabilize his compulsive behavior.
pathological gambling is the most common type of impulse control disorder in the world.
and there is no more superstitious creature on earth than a gambler.
the number 8 is the ritual aspect to our unsub's signature.
it's a compulsion.
it could signify a birthdate or an important time in his life.
not only is this unsub a killer but he's also an addict.
he's killed twice in the last two days and he may not be able to stop.
thank you.
you Jimmy?
over here.
this doesn't make sense. Danny Savino was a bottom-feeder, handing out nickel-and-dime loans to to small-time gamblers.
but Patti riolo was exclusively about high-rollers.
the unsub wouldn't have naturally crossed into both worlds.
he'd be in one or the other.
unless his fortunes changed drastically between murdering Savino and meeting up with Patti riolo.
maybe he flashed the money he stole from Savino in front of her, pretended to be rich.
or he gambled with it and won big.
let's say Dave's right. He was in financial trouble and immediately after murdering Savino, his luck changed.
in his mind, he could have connected the two.
every compulsive gambler believes in a system, no matter how illogical.
and he'd figure the part of his system he'd been missing was murder.
21 for the house.
a cashier was shot to death last night at a gas station in town. And get this
I don't get it.
I lost practically every hand.
Hey, did you see that Circle of 8 guy did it again?
he gunned down some dude in a gas station.
something's off.
my system should have worked, but it...didn't.
please tell me you didn't gas up your car last night.
what? Savino, that hooker.
seems like this guy was only killing people who knew you.
anyway, too bad you didn't get the 50 grand for the buy-in.
Oh, no!
yo. You with me? Uh, meet me outside. I gotta take care of something.
look at us, man.
top-shelf whiskey to 5-buck hoagies one day to the next.
we've been through it all, you and me.
Hey. It's for you.
it's yours. Keep it.
Mm-hmm. You serious?
Yeah.
nice.
you were part of my system and didn't even know it, huh?
well, you know what they say.
the reverse side also has a reverse side. Yeah. Whatever the hell that means.
it means you're part of my system, too, Eddie.
$88. The unsub's getting generous.
there's less rage than the others.
and undoing. There's evidence of remorse.
shot in the back so he wouldn't have to face his victim.
no robbery this time, either. Wallet's intact, except for anything to I. D. him.
is this even the same killer? The ritual's too similar to discount it.
the change in the M. O. makes sense if the unsub is still refining his system.
maybe killing the cashier at the gas station didn't work, so he's back to the drawing board.
two 8s instead of one could also be significant.
I know in China the number 8 symbolizes prosperity.
the more 8s the better. As a matter of fact, in Chungdu a telephone number consisting of all 8s recently sold for over a quarter million dollars.
so why would he be doubling up on his luck out here, away from all the casinos?
there's been another killing. A guest in his room at the Sapphire Lady.
same ritual? No. His neck was broken.
and he was robbed of 50, 000.
but the strange thing is, the killer left nearly 20, 000 behind with the body.
Garcia, is there a casino in the neighborhood of Penrose and Morningside Avenue?
uh...no casinos per se, but there's a private gambling establishment right around the corner.
is it legal? Yeah. But it's ultra exclusive.
they have a monthly high-stakes poker tournament, today being the day for the month, coincidentally enough.
or no coincidence at all.
what's the buy-in? Um...Yikies.
50000
but it's a million-dollar guarantee if you win.
what time does it start? Later this afternoon.
Thanks.
forensics got a fingerprint match on the last victim.
Eddie Langdon. We're looking into him.
Hey, any luck? No, they don't want to allocate agency funds for the buy-in.
I'm still working on it. Well, I can't imagine why not.
we're only asking for 50, 000 bucks of taxpayer money so that FBI agents can play Texas hold 'em.
Hey, what about you? What about me what?
you could stake us the buy-in. Yeah, you're a best-selling author.
why not? No.
one, it's against regulations, and I'd like to hold on to this job for a little while longer.
it's a minor administrative violation.
and two, I prefer to spend my money on actual things, like single-malt scotch, a fine cigar, beautiful artwork.
poker chips are things. Maybe just think of it as like a new experience.
I mean, at your age, how often does that happen? At my what?
Rossi, this may be our only chance to get this guy.
all right. Fine. I'm a decent poker player.
but I can't promise that I can stay in the game long enough to-- you know what?
I bet you're a great poker player, but what if we sent in Reid?
I am banned from casinos in Las Vegas, Laughlin, and Parump because of my card-counting ability.
look, I know I'm not a genius like the boy wonder here, but poker is not Blackjack. It's about bluffing, reading human nature, head games.
it's not math. That's not entirely accurate.
there actually is a mathematical equation for knowing when to raise and when to fold.
if P represents the size of the pot at the time of play, then P times N minus one, with N representing the estimated number of players in the final round of betting
OK, fine. I surrender. Just try not to lose all of my money.
I got it.
some of these guys have records, but the don't fit the profile.
keep looking he's gotta be there.
the last victim, Eddie Langdon, was wearing a watch that was much too big for his wrist.
could it be stolen? Or it was a gift from the unsub.
that fits, given the care and remorse for the victim. Ok, the link is set.
as soon as Reid triggers the alarm, we can move in.
halitosis.
OK, got something for you. All right, talk to me, mama.
Eddie Langdon. High school dropout, lots of odd jobs, never married, lived at transient-type hotels in and around Atlantic City.
started his own plumbing supply business that went bankrupt.
was in jail for 6 months in 2005 for forgery, and that's why we were able to get a match on his prints so fast.
you've always been fast, baby girl.
uh, yeah. Gotta go.
all in.
you know, would it be all right if I sat at table 2 instead of 4?
I have a pre-glaucoma condition and the light's kind of bothering my eyes.
Thanks.
Ah, I'm calling.
I'll raise. 8, 000.
$8, 000. That's, uh, 56 months wages for the average person in Bangladesh.
kind of makes you think, doesn't it?
Hey, it's 8 thou to you.
now, are you in or are you out? I...Am in.
and I raise.
3 raise.
that's too rich for my blood.
are you in, sir? I'll call.
call.
straight.
a gut shot straight draw? Are you kidding me?
that is just-- that is nuts.
that's crazy, man.
do you mind if I take a look at this?
Hey. What's the problem, sir? Hey, he's reaching for my chips.
I was simply admiring-- Sir, you need to come with me.
you don't have to manhandle--I can walk. I'll cooperate. Don't manhandle me. Thanks.
that's Reid. Let's go.
he's an FBI Agent. There he goes. Plaid shirt, baseball hat.
Morgan, he's a white male, baseball cap, he's headed towards the back door.
he's on the move.
we need to look at victimology again. Ok, uh, Garcia said that Eddie Langdon was a high-school dropout, right? Chronic underachiever?
what are you thinking?
well, does that sound like someone who has the financial know-how and business sense to start his own company from scratch all by himself?
sir, you were right.
Eddie Langdon did have a partner in that plumbing supply business.
Curtis Banks. And Banks pops up more than once in Eddie's life.
they shared an apartment together.
when Langdon was in jail for that forgery charge, it was Banks who bailed him out. Oh, there's more.
banks' dad was a compulsive gambler, too.
won some sort of big jackpot in 1988.
the father abandoned the family, ended up 6 months later dead in a Las Vegas hotel room, completely broke. Drank himself to death.
do you have an address for Banks? Yeah. 800 Brigantine Road, Galloway Township.
that's 10 miles from Atlantic City.
Thanks. Tell Reid and Morgan to go to Banks' house. He may head back there.
Yeah, Hotch, there's nobody here. There's a foreclosure sign on the front lawn.
all right, you and Reid stay there in case he comes back.
Yeah, Dave.
I think I know the final piece of the unsub's system.
we know it involves violence. We know it involves the number 8.
but the killing of the person at the gas station didn't work.
what about him was different from his partner, his loan shark, the call girl?
he was a stranger. There was no personal connection.
exactly. That's why before the million-dollar game he killed his best friend.
so the closer the relationship, the better his luck.
and now he's gonna need the biggest infusion of luck he's ever gotten to escape this mess. He's going after his wife.
what the hell? What are you doing?
Curtis! What are you doing here?
Curtis, you need to leave. We're leaving together. We can do that now.
do what?
Tahiti.
look.
poker chips?
uh, we'll get a boat, we'll sail to Bora Bora, and then we'll just-- we'll-- Curtis, we're not going anywhere together.
don't you understand that? Look, you're sick.
we would get to Tahiti and you would find some other reason to play cards.
I'm gonna ask you for the last time... Leave.
Liz, call the police. No--oh
nobody's calling anyone.
what are you doing? What are you doing?
sir, I found something. Teri Banks filed for divorce two days ago.
she wasn't at home.
does she have any relatives or close friends nearby?
Yeah, she has a sister, Liz Dorsey, at 3388 Woodland Loop in Northfield.
got it. Thanks.
babe, maybe you're right.
maybe we can still do this.
Tahiti, right?
fresh start, you and me?
you'd make a lousy gambler, Teri.
no poker face.
now you're just trying to stop what has to happen.
there's his car. - He's in there.
let me go in and talk to him, Aaron.
I know how these guys think.
all right.
JJ, see if you can get an angle on Banks.
Hotch, he's got a gun. He's holding two females hostage.
I don't have a clear shot here. I'm gonna go around the side.
I'm unarmed. I'm unarmed. Hey!
who the hell are you? Come here. Come here, come here.
I'm Agent Rossi with the FBI.
if you move, she is dead.
the house is surrounded.
now, you know there's only one way out of this, Curtis.
you have to let the women go and I'll take their place.
now, I've seen a lot of killers in my life, Curtis, but you're not like them.
you stumbled into this mess.
I can help get you out of it.
but you need to let them go.
get out of here. Go. Move!
sorry.
OK. That's good.
you've made smart decisions, Curtis, like I knew you would.
now, is this your wife? She stays.
you don't want to hurt her, son. She's not the problem.
well, that's where you're wrong.
she never believed in me and what I do.
and when I had good luck, she ruined it.
she's not the reason, Curtis.
it was your father.
there's no such thing as manufacturing luck.
the same obsession is what killed him.
he passed it on to you, but you don't need to be like him.
I just need some time. I need some time, ok? Just give me a minute to think.
that's fine.
Hotch, he moved to the back room.
I still don't have a shot. Sit down.
I need just a minute. Keep your hands where I can see them.
Rossi, he keeps glancing to his left. What's over there?
I see it now.
see what? What do you see, huh?
I see why you feel time is running out.
sand is slipping through the hourglass.
it's 7: 58. That's why he's asking for more time.
he's waiting for 8: 00. Let's go.
I've always loved you, Teri.
even though you fought me.
whatever's next...
we're doing it together.
no, baby, pl-please don't do this.
no, no! Curtis, let her go.
we love each other.
this is our dream. Together.
Curtis, let her go.
all right, Curtis, very slowly put the weapon on the ground.
I guess it is true what they say.
the house always wins.
No!
george Augustus Sala said, "a gambler with a system must be, to a greater or lesser extent, insane.
Hi, miss thing.
enough is enough.
it's time for you and me to have a little sit-down.
what's going on with you? Half the time I call I get your voicemail.
when I do get you, I don't get even a little bit of sass coming my way.
now, what's the deal?
Hello!
OK. Look. I get it that men and women are different and Venus and Mars and all that stuff, but I do not understand how you-- whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Pump your brakes.
what is this about?
you were in my shower at 7: 00 in the morning.
because I shower at 7: 00 in the morning.
baby, you had a little too much to drink the other night.
you called me to come over and keep you company.
I know. I remember that, but-- Ok, what happened between us was popcorn.
and a movie on TV.
which you fell asleep in the middle of, by the way.
so you slept on the-- Couch. Yes, you did.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, thank you, God, for maintaining the integrity of my most beloved of friendships, and from now on,
I promise only mostly the purest of mineral water will cross these lips.
Hey, plum sauce, are you coming? Yeah. I'll be right there.
Hey, what's up, man? Hey, Derek.
since the fight, we have decided to have a standing date every Tuesday night.
good luck with that with this job.
you got a great guy out there. You know that, right?
I know.
what does a girl do when she has two great guys?
she doesn't pour that extra glass of wine.
Oh. Yeah.
OK, love you, bye.
plum sauce?
if this is a sales call on a Sunday morning...
settle.
it's me, JJ. I tried your cell.
listen, something's come up.
you need to get down to the office pronto.
you are kidding. - I know.
I wish psychopathic killers would be a little more respectful of our weekends, too, but what are you gonna do?
is everything ok?
um, no.
Kevin and I got in a fight last night, and to self soothe, I drank a lot of wine.
and, JJ, you know I can't drink wine.
why did I drink so much wine?
you'll be fine.
no, I don't know.
cause right now everything is blurring.
Oh, my God.
my hair hurts. How is that possible?
he's coming out of the shower.
I hate confrontation.
it was such a fight. I hate confrontation.
then don't confront.
just kiss, make up, and get your butt over here.
what is this, Grand Central Station?
Oh, God.
I am so sorry about last night.
I should not have stormed out like that.
you stormed out? - Yeah.
you stormed out all last night? - Yeah.
what's, uh-- Hey.
you see we gotta go in, right?
Yes. Y-yes.
uh, JJ just called me, too.
let's go.
my things.
mine and mine and-- this is yours.
this is mine.
see you there.
Hey, let's go.
Danny Savino, the floor manager at the Sapphire Lady casino in Atlantic City was found dead in his office this morning.
blunt force trauma to the head.
an empty wallet and money clip left next to the body.
mug shot. This guy's got a record.
Savino was a member of the Agnoli crime family.
sorry. Sorry.
they're active in the Atlantic City area.
how's the head?
not all the aspirins in all the pharmacies...
it looks like a robbery gone bad.
why was the BAU called in?
8 one-dollar bills surrounding an 8 card.
that's highly ritualistic.
and because Savino has ties to organized crime, agents in New Jersey are worried about things escalating.
well, it doesn't take much to ignite a mob war.
and collateral damage means nothing to these guys.
if we don't get a handle on this soon, innocent people are gonna die.
Hey, honey, it's me.
listen, the most amazing thing is happening.
I'm at the Sapphire Lady right now, and I am on a run you would not believe.
everything we ever talked about, it's gonna happen.
I'll try you again later, ok, Honey?
Bye.
a Chinese proverb says,"at the gambling table, there are no fathers and sons.
no question."Godfather II," hands down.
no, no, gotta be "Scarface."
for me,"The Untouchables.
mm, probably "Le Cercle Rouge," the 1970s French classic.
but "Den tredje v√•gen" is definitely a close second.
Yeah, that was my runner-up, too.
what about you, Rossi?
best ever gangster flick.
I've had too much of the real thing to be a fan of mob movies.
Garcia, did we get the crime scene surveillance video yet?
no, sir, because there wasn't any.
that's not possible. Every inch of the casino is surveilled every minute of every day.
Yeah. Apparently the footage was tampered with, so...
all right. Reid and Prentiss, go to the crime scene.
Dave, you and JJ find out if Savino was involved in anything the local authorities don't know about.
morgan and I will contact the local FBI office and arrange a ceasefire with the families.
Yes, sir, you're on the line.
there you go.
that's very good.
Yes! Yes! Yes!
it looks like the party's over here.
mind if I join?
there you are.
Eddie! That's my man. There you are.
gee, Curtis. Those all yours?
Oh, yes.
stay right here.
I've got plans with you.
Oh, you are on a hot streak.
too bad your old man couldn't see this, huh?
Hey, did you hear what happened last night?
Danny Savino got his head bashed in.
he's dead.
didn't you two--you two did some business together, right?
you good to go? - Not anymore. Yes, here we go.
Winner--8 the hard way!
Oh, yes! Thank you.
you look a little strung out, man.
when's the last time you got some sleep?
Oh, I don't know, man. A couple of days.
yeah?
you would not believe what's been going on with me, man.
it's crazy.
so I was headed up north for a job interview.
a job interview? What about the job you already got?
Yeah. I got fired. - How come?
I punched out my boss. All right?
but look, look, look.
I stopped on the turnpike, I buy a scratcher.
Bam!$250 instant winner.
so I jump in the car, I pop a u-turn, I come right back here.
come on.
so I walk in the casino, it happens again.
I put a dollar in the slot machine, $500 payout.
and now this.
I am on the craziest roll.
I'm telling you.
if I get the buy-in for that million-dollar poker tournament the day after tomorrow,
I'm telling you, I could win that. Listen, I could win that.
what have you been smoking?
that's a 50-grand buy-in.
I hope you don't mind.
I thought a little celebration was in order.
no, don't mind at all.
money well spent.
are we good to go? Everyone ready?
trust me.
all right, let's go 500.
8 the hard way again.
you want me to blow on them?
pile on, everybody.
please
come on, be good to me.
electric strike lock.
impressive.
and hard to bypass.
if this was a robbery, the unsub must have slipped in right behind him.
but Savino could have known the killer.
he could have let him in himself.
he wasn't expecting this to turn into a brawl.
you know, maybe the unsub wasn't either.
if this was premeditated, you'd think he would have brought a knife or a gun with him.
the bowling trophy's more a weapon of opportunity.
is this the only camera?
Yes, ma'am, but the disk was removed.
the casinos have a central terminal that backs up and stores all surveillance footage, right?
Mr. Savino didn't want that in his office.
he put in a personal camera.
so the victim bypassed a security system that would have revealed his own killer.
what didn't he want anyone to see?
put your hands together for Ginger...
who's asking?
agent Jareau. This is Agent Rossi. We're with the FBI.
we understand you've cooperated with the Bureau before when we've needed information.
"before" being the operative word.
I'm retired.
this is how you plan on spending your golden years?
what can I say?
some guys like to futz around with little golf carts, me, I love the ladies.
I hear ya.
me, I like to spend my time chatting with my old friends down at the New Jersey parole board.
listen, we just need you to come out of retirement long enough to tell us a little about Danny Savino.
he's dead now, so what the hell.
for 8 days and 7 nights of sheer heaven, afternoon massages on white sandy beaches, yes, you can win an all-expenses-paid trip to paradise.
but you can't win if you don't play.
but you already know that, don't you, Curtis?
you've dreamed of this your whole life.
most people don't understand, but you're not like most people, are you, Curtis?
you don't think small.
you are not content with a small life.
all this is going to be yours, Curtis, for you and your wife.
you just need to maintain your focus.
don't waver.
it's right there, if you can just win.
what are you doing?
sorry, sweetheart, he's taken.
Really?
I'm his wife.
all right, let's go. Come here. Come here.
I'm winning, Teri. I'm winning big.
you told me you were going to Philly.
I was. But I stumbled onto this system.
I don't really understand it myself yet-- every week you got a new system.
we can't pay the mortgage.
the bank is foreclosing on us.
but this-- this system works.
there's a big poker tournament day after tomorrow.
million-dollar winner take all.
the streak I'm on right now, I could win that thing.
we'd be rich.
and then I'm done.
I swear.
I want a divorce. - What?
I'm sorry. I'm going to my sister's.
you -- you show up here and you announce that?
you're hurting me, Curtis.
this is our dream.
yours and mine together.
you're hurting me.
stay away. I mean it.
we appreciate your cooperation.
agent Goslin.
any luck with our mob bosses?
well, I think we bought some time.
what about the crime scene?
Savino purposely bypassed the standard casino security.
and I think we know why.
Danny Savino supplemented his income by loaning money to casino patrons.
it explains why he changed the camera in his office.
he didn't want his bosses to know he was freelancing.
so we're looking for a gambler.
a gambler in Atlantic City.
that narrows the field.
7 out.
you scared me. - Sorry.
uh, we never got to finish that champagne.
pass.
I -- I don't know what happened, but my luck is gonna turn around.
Yeah, well, when it does, give me a call.
maybe -- maybe we could go somewhere and
I said no, ok? We came up empty tonight, both of us.
it happens.
I meant what I said about my luck turning around.
it's going to. I can sense it.
right.
with that gambler's esp of yours.
you and all the other losers in this town.
Hey, what are you looking for?
discarded matches.
the victim had a freshly-lit cigarette.
but there was no lighter or matches in her purse or the car.
our unsub lit it for her.
it means she wasn't afraid of him.
Hey, Garcia, you're on speaker.
Patti Riolo, aka Francesca.
hometown, Rice Lake, Wisconsin.
up until 3 years ago, she worked with a high-end escort service in Manhattan.
how high, you ask? I will tell you.
nosebleed high.
$5, 000 a night and up.
now she's trolling gaming tables in Atlantic City.
I imagine that 5 grand a night window was very short in her profession.
well, this is gonna turn into a circus real fast.
both residents and visitors to Atlantic City are on edge tonight as the Circle of 8 killer has apparently struck again.
no way. That's the hooker who was all over you last night.
they're saying the same guy killed Danny Savino.
you knew both victims. That's weird.
my bad luck must have rubbed off on them.
listen, you gotta forget about Teri.
she was holding you back.
every time she stuck her nose in things, your luck went cold.
Hey, you could win that million-dollar tournament and then go to Tahiti on your own, huh?
Yeah! Live your dreams, man.
you know where we spent our honeymoon?
where?
some half-assed motel in Florida.
went to a theme park.
teri deserves better than that.
I promised her we'd...
go to Tahiti.
I'm gonna show you something, man.
you carry around a picture of a watch?
you want something, you keep it close.
that's the dumbest thing I ever heard.
go ahead and make fun, but when I hit it big, that's the first thing I'm gonna do, is buy that watch I just showed you.
then I want to see your face.
come on, man, first one's on me.
make your own luck.
come on.
4 aces?
your mojo is back big time!
you make a deal with the devil or what?
winner, winner, chicken dinner.
we're looking for a man who's killing those who appear to prey upon or take advantage of gamblers.
loan sharks and call girls so far.
the killings may have been triggered by recent gambling losses.
our unsub is physically fit.
he was able to overpower Danny Savino, and Patti Riolo was killed with extreme violence.
it's doubtful this person has a criminal record.
he moves without fear of being recognized in one of the most surveilled locales on the planet.
he wouldn't have elements of a domestic life, like children.
that would only moderate or stabilize his compulsive behavior.
pathological gambling is the most common type of impulse control disorder in the world.
and there is no more superstitious creature on earth than a gambler.
the number 8 is the ritual aspect to our unsub's signature.
it's a compulsion.
it could signify a birthdate or an important time in his life.
not only is this unsub a killer but he's also an addict.
he's killed twice in the last two days and he may not be able to stop.
thank you.
you Jimmy?
over here.
this doesn't make sense.
Danny Savino was a bottom-feeder, handing out nickel-and-dime loans to to small-time gamblers.
but Patti riolo was exclusively about high-rollers.
the unsub wouldn't have naturally crossed into both worlds.
he'd be in one or the other.
unless his fortunes changed drastically between murdering Savino and meeting up with Patti riolo.
maybe he flashed the money he stole from Savino in front of her, pretended to be rich.
or he gambled with it and won big.
let's say Dave's right.
he was in financial trouble and immediately after murdering Savino, his luck changed.
in his mind, he could have connected the two.
every compulsive gambler believes in a system, no matter how illogical.
and he'd figure the part of his system he'd been missing was murder.
dealer shows 21.
21 for the house.
a cashier was shot to death last night at a gas station in town.
and get this -- $8. 00 and an 8 card left on his body.
I don't get it.
I lost practically every hand.
Hey, did you see that Circle of 8 guy did it again?
he gunned down some dude in a gas station.
something's off.
my system should have worked, but it...didn't.
please tell me you didn't gas up your car last night.
what?
Savino, that hooker.
seems like this guy was only killing people who knew you.
anyway, too bad you didn't get the 50 grand for the buy-in.
Oh, no!
yo. You with me?
uh, meet me outside.
I gotta take care of something.
look at us, man.
top-shelf whiskey to 5-buck hoagies one day to the next.
we've been through it all, you and me.
it's for you. It's yours. Keep it.
you serious?
Yeah. Nice.
you were part of my system and didn't even know it, huh?
well, you know what they say.
the reverse side also has a reverse side.
Yeah. Whatever the hell that means.
it means you're part of my system, too, Eddie.
$88. The unsub's getting generous.
there's less rage than the others.
and undoing.
there's evidence of remorse.
shot in the back so he wouldn't have to face his victim.
no robbery this time, either.
wallet's intact, except for anything to I. D. him.
is this even the same killer?
the ritual's too similar to discount it.
the change in the M. O. makes sense if the unsub is still refining his system.
maybe killing the cashier at the gas station didn't work, so he's back to the drawing board.
two 8s instead of one could also be significant.
I know in China the number 8 symbolizes prosperity.
the more 8s the better.
as a matter of fact, in Chengdu a telephone number consisting of all 8s recently sold for over a quarter million dollars.
so why would he be doubling up on his luck out here, away from all the casinos?
there's been another killing.
a guest in his room at the Sapphire Lady.
same ritual?
no. His neck was broken.
and he was robbed of 50, 000.
but the strange thing is, the killer left nearly 20, 000 behind with the body.
Garcia, is there a casino in the neighborhood of Penrose and Morningside Avenue?
uh...no casinos per se, but there's a private gambling establishment right around the corner.
is it legal?
Yeah.
but it's ultra exclusive.
they have a monthly high-stakes poker tournament, today being the day for the month, coincidentally enough.
or no coincidence at all.
what's the buy-in?
Um...Yikies. $50, 000.
but it's a million-dollar guarantee if you win.
what time does it start?
later this afternoon. - Thanks.
forensics got a fingerprint match on the last victim.
Eddie Langdon.
we're looking into him.
Hey, any luck?
no, they don't want to allocate agency funds for the buy-in.
I'm still working on it.
well, I can't imagine why not.
we're only asking for 50, 000 bucks of taxpayer money so that FBI agents can play Texas hold 'em.
Hey, what about you?
what about me what?
you could stake us the buy-in.
Yeah, you're a best-selling author.
no. - Why not?
one, it's against regulations, and I'd like to hold on to this job for a little while longer.
it's a minor administrative violation.
and two, I prefer to spend my money on actual things, like single-malt scotch, a fine cigar, beautiful artwork.
poker chips are things.
maybe just think of it as like a new experience.
I mean, at your age, how often does that happen?
at my what?
Rossi, this may be our only chance to get this guy.
all right. Fine. I'm a decent poker player.
but I can't promise that I can stay in the game long enough to
you know what? I bet you're a great poker player, but what if we sent in Reid?
I am banned from casinos in Las Vegas, Laughlin, and Parump because of my card-counting ability.
look, I know I'm not a genius like the boy wonder here, but poker is not Blackjack.
it's about bluffing, reading human nature, head games.
it's not math.
that's not entirely accurate.
there actually is a mathematical equation for knowing when to raise and when to fold.
if P represents the size of the pot at the time of play, then P times N minus one, with N representing the estimated number of players in the final round of betting
OK, fine. I surrender.
just try not to lose all of my money.
some of these guys have records, but they don't fit the profile.
keep looking he's gotta be there.
the last victim, Eddie Langdon, was wearing a watch that was much too big for his wrist.
could it be stolen?
or it was a gift from the unsub.
that fits, given the care and remorse for the victim.
OK, the link is set.
as soon as Reid triggers the alarm, we can move in.
halitosis.
OK, got something for you.
all right, talk to me, mama.
Eddie Langdon. High school dropout, lots of odd jobs, never married, lived at transient-type hotels in and around Atlantic City.
started his own plumbing supply business that went bankrupt.
was in jail for 6 months in 2005 for forgery, and that's why we were able to get a match on his prints so fast.
you've always been fast, baby girl.
uh, yeah.
gotta go.
flush to the king.
I'll count it, sir.
all in.
you know, would it be all right if I sat at table 2 instead of 4?
I have a pre-glaucoma condition and the light's kind of bothering my eyes.
Thanks.
Ah, I'm calling.
I'll raise.
$8, 000. That's, uh, 56 months wages for the average person in Bangladesh.
kind of makes you think, doesn't it?
Hey, it's 8 thou to you.
now, are you in or are you out?
I...Am in. And I raise.
3 raise.
that's too rich for my blood.
are you in, sir?
I'll call.
call. - Straight.
a gut shot straight draw?
are you kidding me?
that is just-- that is nuts.
that's crazy, man.
do you mind if I take a look at this?
what's the problem, sir? - Hey, he's reaching for my chips.
I was simply admiring-- Sir, you need to come with me.
you don't have to manhandle--I can walk.
I'll cooperate. Don't manhandle me. Thanks.
that's Reid. Let's go.
he's an FBI Agent.
there he goes. Plaid shirt, baseball hat.
Morgan, he's a white male, baseball cap, he's headed towards the back door.
he's on the move.
we need to look at victimology again.
OK, uh, Garcia said that Eddie Langdon was a high-school dropout, right? Chronic underachiever?
what are you thinking?
well, does that sound like someone who has the financial know-how and business sense to start his own company from scratch all by himself?
sir, you were right.
Eddie Langdon did have a partner in that plumbing supply business.
and Banks pops up more than once in Eddie's life.
they shared an apartment together.
when Langdon was in jail for that forgery charge, it was Banks who bailed him out.
Oh, there's more.
banks' dad was a compulsive gambler, too.
won some sort of big jackpot in 1988.
the father abandoned the family, ended up 6 months later dead in a Las Vegas hotel room, completely broke.
drank himself to death.
do you have an address for Banks?
Yeah. 800 Brigantine Road, Galloway Township.
that's 10 miles from Atlantic City.
Thanks. Tell Reid and Morgan to go to Banks' house. He may head back there.
Yeah, Hotch, there's nobody here.
there's a foreclosure sign on the front lawn.
all right, you and Reid stay there in case he comes back.
Yeah, Dave.
I think I know the final piece of the unsub's system.
we know it involves violence.
we know it involves the number 8.
but the killing of the person at the gas station didn't work.
what about him was different from his partner, his loan shark, the call girl?
he was a stranger. There was no personal connection.
exactly.
that's why before the million-dollar game he killed his best friend.
so the closer the relationship, the better his luck.
and now he's gonna need the biggest infusion of luck he's ever gotten to escape this mess.
he's going after his wife.
what the hell? What are you doing?
Curtis! What are you doing here?
Curtis, you need to leave.
we're leaving together. We can do that now.
do what? - Tahiti.
look. - Poker chips?
uh, we'll get a boat, we'll sail to Bora Bora, and then we'll just
we'll-- Curtis, we're not going anywhere together.
don't you understand that? Look, you're sick.
we would get to Tahiti and you would find some other reason to play cards.
I'm gonna ask you for the last time...
leave.
Liz, call the police.
No--oh-- nobody's calling anyone.
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
sir, I found something.
teri Banks filed for divorce two days ago.
she wasn't at home.
does she have any relatives or close friends nearby?
Yeah, she has a sister, Liz Dorsey, at 3388 Woodland Loop in Northfield.
got it. Thanks.
babe, maybe you're right.
maybe we can still do this.
Tahiti, right?
fresh start, you and me?
you'd make a lousy gambler, Teri.
no poker face.
now you're just trying to stop what has to happen.
there's his car. - He's in there.
let me go in and talk to him, Aaron.
I know how these guys think. - All right.
JJ, see if you can get an angle on Banks.
Hotch, he's got a gun.
he's holding two females hostage.
I don't have a clear shot here. I'm gonna go around the side.
I'm unarmed. I'm unarmed.
who the hell are you?
come here. Come here, come here.
I'm Agent Rossi with the FBI.
if you move, she is dead.
the house is surrounded.
now, you know there's only one way out of this, Curtis.
you have to let the women go and I'll take their place.
now, I've seen a lot of killers in my life, Curtis, but you're not like them.
you stumbled into this mess.
I can help get you out of it.
but you need to let them go.
get out of here.
go. Move!
sorry
OK. That's good.
you've made smart decisions, Curtis, like I knew you would.
now, is this your wife?
she stays.
you don't want to hurt her, son.
she's not the problem.
well, that's where you're wrong.
she never believed in me and what I do.
and when I had good luck, she ruined it.
she's not the reason, Curtis.
it was your father.
there's no such thing as manufacturing luck.
the same obsession is what killed him.
he passed it on to you, but you don't need to be like him.
I just need some time.
I need some time, ok? Just give me a minute to think.
that's fine.
Hotch, he moved to the back room.
I still don't have a shot.
sit down.
I need just a minute.
keep your hands where I can see them.
Rossi, he keeps glancing to his left.
what's over there?
I see it now.
see what?
what do you see, huh?
I see why you feel time is running out.
sand is slipping through the hourglass.
it's 7: 58. That's why he's asking for more time.
he's waiting for 8: 00. Let's go.
I've always loved you, Teri.
even though you fought me.
whatever's next...
we're doing it together.
no, baby, pl-please don't do this.
Curtis, let her go. - No, no!
we love each other.
this is our dream.
together.
Curtis, let her go.
all right, Curtis, very slowly put the weapon on the ground.
I guess it is true what they say.
the house always wins.
No!
george Augustus Sala said,"a gambler with a system, must be, to a greater or lesser extent, insane."
Hi, miss thing.
enough is enough.
it's time for you and me to have a little sit-down.
what's going on with you?
half the time I call I get your voicemail.
when I do get you, I don't get even a little bit of sass coming my way.
now, what's the deal?
Hello!
OK. Look. I get it that men and women are different and Venus and Mars and all that stuff, but I do not understand how you
pump your brakes.
what is this about?
you were in my shower at 7: 00 in the morning.
because I shower at 7: 00 in the morning.
baby, you had a little too much to drink the other night.
you called me to come over and keep you company.
I know. I remember that, but
OK, what happened between us was popcorn.
and a movie on TV.
which you fell asleep in the middle of, by the way.
so you slept on the-- Couch.
Yes, you did.
Oh, thank you. Oh, thank you, God, for maintaining the integrity of my most beloved of friendships, and from now on, I promise only mostly the purest of mineral water will cross these lips.
Hey, plum sauce, are you coming? - Yeah. I'll be right there.
Hey, Derek. - Hey, what's up, man?
since the fight, we have decided to have a standing date every Tuesday night.
good luck with that with this job.
you got a great guy out there. You know that, right?
I know.
what does a girl do when she has two great guys?
she doesn't pour that extra glass of wine.
Yeah.
OK, love you, bye.
plum sauce?
to the class of 2012, may the world end after we've had our fun in college, not before.
I can't believe that this time next year you're gonna be so far away.
well, I'm here now. That's what matters.
I know, but...
you're gonna meet some hot sorority slut and
and you're gonna meet some hot frat guy.
in the chemistry department? Yeah, right.
just remember, you're gonna be a hot sorority slut, too.
I am not a slut.
don't I know it.
come on.
where are you going?
to test your theory.
wait. You're always gonna be my guy...
right, Johnny?
as long as you're always gonna be my girl.
what is that?
it's coming from inside the tower.
wait here.
stay back.
is that all you got?
does that sound like it's gonna be enough? - This is so mine.
no, Hotchner, I'm taking this. Don't do it. - Yeah, I'm gonna have to beat you.
No!
I don't think it's gonna be enough.
Oh, no! - No!
Oh, no!
that's not fair!
you all right?
cramp? - Yes. Yeah.
I think... - You sure...
I think I'm gonna beat you. Yeah!
that's really pathetic. - I win. - Really?
you know, you don't win if you cheat.
come on. You just gotta learn to keep up.
what happened to slow and steady wins the race?
who taught you that?
my training partner.
she sounds brilliant.
Oh, she is.
she's very smart.
training's easier with a partner.
I've been meaning to remind you to thank me for that.
our lunches are ok, too.
Yes, they are.
so, I was reading that you shouldn't train the week before the race.
so, this might be it.
what are we gonna do about that?
well, I think we should do something.
aaron Hotchner, are you asking me out on a date?
I'm trying.
it's not going very well.
accepted and eagerly anticipated.
when shall I expect my chariot?
Friday? - Yeah.
morning.
what?
you work out this morning?
I did.
and how was the, uh, workout?
it's called training, and it was fine.
right. Training.
for what, though?
just stop.
you know, race day's almost here.
you'll need a new excuse to see her.
it's been handled.
Attaboy.
when? - Friday.
come hell or high water, Aaron, I will get us back by Friday.
so, last night, 3 unidentified males were found in a lifeguard tower in Los Angeles' south bay.
ages are estimated between mid-20s and early 40s.
each died from a single gunshot wound to the head.
Yeah, and two of the bodies were wrapped in plastic.
it could be practical.
to keep blood from spreading?
or symbolic.
covering the bodies could be his way of showing remorse for the kills.
Yeah, why not wrap the third body?
maybe the unsub left him exposed specifically because of who he represents.
well, identifying the bodies should be our top priority.
Yes. Which is why I'm currently running prints and facial recognition.
hopefully we'll be done by the time you guys land.
the lifeguard tower is not due to open for another month, and that's probably not a coincidence.
we should look at recently released inmates in the area, make sure he didn't learn his clean-up skills on the inside.
Hey, guys, there's something else.
according to the M. E. Report, each of the victims was missing their genitals.
he could be trying to hide evidence of sexual assault.
maybe.
jeffrey Dahmer used to keep his victims' sex organs on display.
what if this unsub is doing the same thing?
for trust not him that hath once broken faith.
william Shakespeare.
he's castrating the victims postmortem, so torture isn't his game.
a shot to the head is efficient.
I don't think he wants his victims to suffer.
and a quick kill is impersonal.
and it lacks the thrill on which a lot of unsubs thrive.
yet the castration is very personal.
he probably knew his victims.
or he could be impotent.
the unsub feels emasculated, so he wants his victims to feel the same way.
you know, the scorecard killer, Randy Craft, mutilated his victims in a similar, yet more severe fashion.
that was to hide the fact that he targeted hitchhikers and gay men.
kraft also raped his victims before dumping them on the side of the road.
Ding dong. I have I. D.'D all the dead people.
the information is there at your tablets.
it turns out each of those 3 men was in town on business.
none of them lived there.
so he crosses age, race, and socioeconomic backgrounds.
no physical similarities either.
it says here that one of the victims, Sean Taylor, was in a domestic partnership.
he's gay.
but Hank Mitchell has a female spouse.
that doesn't necessarily preclude homosexual desire.
which victim was left exposed?
so, like Craft, he could be targeting victims based on sexual orientation.
Hey, guys, I'll be right back.
what are you doing here?
I had to see you.
I'm at school. You can't just be here.
I know. - It's crazy. I...
I had a really rough night last night, and I thought if I could see you, then maybe the day would be a little better.
you could have called first.
if someone sees you, I could get in trouble.
OK. - Ok. I'll go.
when can I see you next?
I have a game tomorrow night.
pick me up after. I'll come over to your place.
I can't spend the night, though.
fine. Whatever. It's all good.
go.
cool.
let's go.
Quinn Parker, S.A.C. - Agent Hotchner.
this is Agent Prentiss. Where would you like for us to set up?
this way.
another body was discovered this morning, hidden in a lifeguard tower in Manhattan Beach.
he changed the dump site, now that the other one's been discovered.
we've been sweeping all the towers since the first discovery.
this body was dumped sometime between 4: 00 and 6:00 a.m.
increase the patrols to every hour, but vary the search.
it's likely he's following the investigation and he's adapting.
this body was left exposed like Sean Taylor's.
joseph Kraus. 42, San Fernando Valley native, works downtown.
not sure what he was doing in the south bay.
have the families arrived?
Yeah. Kraus's wife just got here. The others are flying in.
I'll speak to Mrs. Kraus, and I'll reroute Morgan and Rossi to the new dump site.
I'll talk to the families.
Mrs. Kraus, I'm Agent Hotchner.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
it's just so hard to believe he's gone.
had Joseph given any indication as to where he was going when he disappeared?
Oh, Joe, please.
only his mother called him Joseph.
no, he just said he needed some fresh air.
I didn't question it.
he was found in Manhattan beach.
does that mean anything to you?
we went to lmu for college.
in freshman year his dad died.
and he used to go to the beach at night to collect his thoughts.
was there anything in particular that prompted his departure?
uh, he lost his job.
and was worried about finances?
we both were.
there's no lights anywhere, Rossi.
he could easily dump a body without being seen.
the unsub dragged him up the ramp.
he wasn't in plastic when he was brought here.
so that's two bodies wrapped and two bodies left exposed.
why is the unsub differentiating?
the rest of the M. O. is the same.
GSW to the head, severed genitals.
but why did he leave this guy unwrapped like Taylor?
Hey, baby girl, tell me you got something good.
Hey, the M. E. Report came back, and none of the victims were sexually assaulted, aside from that unfortunate appendage removal thing.
any luck on the paper trails?
Sean Taylor used his credit card at a gym near the convention center.
JJ and Reid are on their way there now.
see if you can hack their cell phones, too.
maybe they were meeting up with someone the night they disappeared.
Yes, I know you like me one step ahead, so, there were no calls near time of disappearance, and the rest is gonna take a little longer to crack.
thank you, Crazy.
anytime. Fantasy fatale bids you good day.
Rossi, he discarded Joseph like he was trash.
but there's no indication in the victimology to suggest that he should be viewed that way.
maybe the unsub hits on his victims, and this is what happens when someone rejects him.
if that's the case, they why target straight men at all?
maybe rejection's his hot button.
did you get anything?
Joe Kraus lost his job the day he went missing.
that fits.
I've got one victim that just defaulted on a mortgage, another victim who served divorce papers the day before flying to Los Angeles.
they've each suffered a loss.
the unsub probably has, too.
all right, so what am I looking for?
a sexually ambiguous male of indiscriminate ethnicity who may or may not have lost a job, wife, or loved one?
no. There's only one gay victim, so you are most likely looking for a heterosexual male, who somehow learned all of those things about his victims in a very short time.
someone who knows the south bay and targets men unfamiliar with the area who won't be quickly missed.
this means he's sociable, but he doesn't stick out.
and these are probably not his first kills.
if this concept of shared losses is what's connecting the unsub and the victims.
how and where is it happening?
that's good.
gotta keep your heart rate up.
how can I help you today?
agent Jareau of the FBI.
ma'am.
I called about taking a look at your surveillance footage from last week.
right. This way.
is it common for traveling business professionals to use your facility?
it's our specialty, actually.
we get a lot of out-of-towners because of the convention center.
business really picked up when we added the pay-by-day rate.
wouldn't hotels have gyms of their own?
some do.
we have contracts with the ones that don't.
OK. 7 p. m. Last Thursday, like you asked.
that's him. That's Sean Taylor.
can you show me where he goes next? - Yeah.
Hotch just informed me that each of the victims suffered a loss prior to disappearance.
well, what was Taylor's loss?
stock market troubles resulted in him losing his summer home.
Hey, Spence, look at this.
he's moving faster than he's capable of.
we see this all the time, people frustrated with work coming in just to blow off steam.
he's punishing himself in a self-destructive manner.
this isn't someone who's suffered a loss.
this is someone who's angry at the world.
he was here nearly 3 hours.
this is him just before he left.
reid: This can't be about just losing a summer home.
we're gonna need a copy of this.
OK. - Thank you.
Hey, Garcia, I'm gonna put you on speakerphone, ok?
hey yourself, 187.
I have a new mystery for you to solve.
your guy, Sean Taylor, he rented a blue Charger while he was in town.
Where's the car now?
that is the mystery.
local P. D. Can't find it, and the rental service activated the lojack system.
it's been deactivated.
how skilled would our unsub need to be in order to deactivate the GPS?
a novice would not be good at that.
but the mechanical elite, they could do it without a hitch.
did any of the other victims have cars in the city?
uh...just one. Joseph Kraus.
Hey, his car's missing, too.
all right, Garcia, start pulling auto workers in the area and cross it with prior offenses, no matter how small.
this unsub's going to great lengths to cover his tracks, so he's gotta be in the system somewhere.
copy that. Here I go.
how's he hiding their cars?
working kind of late, aren't you?
security Company called to see if your code was still good.
what are you doing here, Mike?
I don't know.
I thought maybe we could talk.
so, pick up the phone.
I wasn't sure you'd answer.
you're the one that doesn't return calls.
listen, I miss my best friend.
friends?
Fr-friends.- Yeah.
at this point, I doubt we ever were.
I'm sorry about what happened.
I never meant to- never meant to what?
to ruin my life?
no, man. I just want to fix it.
you want to fix it.
what are you gonna do, put a band-aid on it?
no, there's some things that just can't be fixed.
this was a mistake. I gotta go.
listen, I'm really sorry, Mike!
Hey, isn't there anything I can do?
anything to make it up to you?
sure. You could kill yourself.
the murders started nearly two months ago, but the time in between kills has accelerated over the past week.
Why?
well, if the unsub suffered a loss, we could be looking for someone who was fired back then and struggling to pay his bills now.
or divorcees currently undergoing custody hearings.
reid: He's most likely operating in one of the coastal cities.
the victims were all staying in the metropolitan area, but their bodies were found near the ocean.
do you know how big the California coastline is?
840 miles.
fortunately, based on the unsub's comfort zone, we can narrow down the area between Santa Monica and Redondo beach, and the paper trail shows each of the victims in the downtown area until about 9 p. m. The night they disappeared.
after that they go off grid.
so how are the victims ending up in the south bay?
well, we haven't found any of the missing cars.
we know he's probably nonthreatening.
what if he asks for a lift and then kills them en route?
but how does he know that his victims fit his emotional criteria?
there's no common denominator outside the loss that each has suffered.
Sean Taylor did look pretty distraught before storming out of the gym.
Elaine Kraus said that her husband would often go to the beach to clear his head.
what if they're all doing that?
maybe he's not taking them to the beach.
maybe he's hunting them there.
I mean, it gets to the point where you can't even look at yourself in the mirror.
you think it's your fault.
sometimes you have to move on, but sometimes you can't move on.
and that's no way to live.
of course there's always the easy way out.
but who wants to take that?
you got responsibilities.
what I'm trying to say, Gus...
is I understand.
I do.
and you no longer have to suffer.
please let me go!
I won't ignore your pain.
Oh, no, I'm not in pain, I promise.
I feel better now.
see? You know how many times I said that exact same thing?
it's the truth! - No. This is the truth.
No! Someone help me, please!
no one can hear you.
the vic's name was Gus Harrington.
found him underneath the pier in Santa Monica.
he changed his method of disposal to avoid detection, but he's staying near the beach because he's compelled to.
it means something to him.
the credit card history indicated Harrington was staying here.
looks like he was drowning his sorrows.
he emptied the mini bar first.
a man in this condition couldn't have driven to the beach.
Yeah, his car is still in the hotel parking.
so he was intoxicated when he got dressed.
a drunk target would be easier to subdue.
so where would he go next?
he ran out of booze.
he probably went to find more.
we believe we're looking for a white male in his 30s or 40s who's targeting emotionally distraught men.
cell phone records show none of the victims made calls or had appointments the evenings they went missing.
this unsub selects his target, befriends him, and then kills him all in one night.
this means that he's ordinary, unimposing, easy to talk to.
because he can get his victims to open up and reveal personal information, we believe he's able to somehow project a sense of familiarity towards them.
Morgan: That familiarity most likely comes in the form of a shared loss.
he's targeting down-and-out businessmen struggling in their everyday life.
he preys upon their vulnerability and then kills his victims with single shots to the head.
he believes that he's being merciful, putting them out of their misery.
because he feels compelled to remove his victims' genitals, we believe he feels emasculated by his own loss.
most of the victims are from out of town and new to the area, so we should look at anyone trusted to offer advice to visiting professionals.
the unsub most likely has a working knowledge of auto mechanics, or at the very least, the resources to disable the car's GPS system.
what are you doing here?
I need a reason now?
I paid for this house.
why were you at Hunter's school yesterday?
he told you? - Of course he told me.
I just wanted to see him.
you know what the court said.
supervised visitation.
I'm his father!
well, stalking isn't parenting.
hunter's scared.
he doesn't think he knows his father anymore.
gee, I wonder why.
we believe that our unsub's comfort zone is in the south bay district, so we should start our search there.
but having said that, it's important not to display too heavy of a police presence.
why is that?
he's gone to great lengths to protect his identity.
that's because he has something to lose.
if he feels that we're closing in on him, it's likely he'll move to another location and start killing there.
thank you.
go ahead, Garcia.
the M. E. Ran liver tests.
all of the victims had elevated levels of alcohol in their systems.
we should narrow our search to liquor stores and bars.
the unsub could be hunting his victims there.
but wait, there's more.
in my obsessive cross-checking, I unearthed something, and by something, I mean nothing.
explain.
the trail runs frosty, my friends.
none of the victims purchased alcohol on the night they went missing.
I'm clever. I even checked ATM transactions to see if they used cash.
zilch.
zero dinero spent on the sauce.
Oh, how are they drinking?
good work, Garcia.
the unsub couldn't have known his victims more than a few hours.
is he just convincing total strangers to let him buy their drinks?
in my experience, people don't question an open bar.
they just give thanks and order another round.
you know, he could be finding his targets on the streets and then inviting them to his house for a private party.
but how is he able to figure out that they match his victimology?
in order for him to do that, he'd have to spend time with them, listen to their troubles.
what are you thinking?
who can you pour your problems to over drinks, even though you've never met them before?
the same person who can make sure you don't run a tab or a paper trail.
the kitchen's gonna be closing up pretty soon.
you want to put an order in before the cook goes home?
no. Peanuts are fine, thanks.
could use another one.
rough day?
Yeah. Rough life.
want to talk about it?
there are hundreds or bars and clubs in the south bay.
not including ones in hotels and restaurants.
I mean, how are we supposed to narrow it down?
it doesn't take into account a lot of bartenders work multiple venues...
private parties, events.
we're looking for a needle in a haystack.
if the unsub's a bartender, he probably hears sob stories all the time.
the trigger's gotta be something more specific than that.
it can't just be about loss, like you said?
these losses aren't sufficient enough to warrant mercy killings.
especially not by someone who's heard it all before.
guys, what if the losses aren't what's triggering the unsub?
what if it's the catalyst to the losses?
a behavioral trait each of the victims had that made them vulnerable to loss.
or an event so overwhelming it's consuming everything in their life.
loss of job, home, family.
what event could cause each of those?
what if it's the emotional toll of a failed relationship?
he's targeting victims with broken hearts.
once the trust is broken, you never get it back.
not ever.
I hear you, buddy.
my best friend just moved in with my wife.
no. - Yep.
women. - Yeah.
can I get you another one?
as soon as I get back.
what's, uh, troubling you, Hon?
hope that, uh, women comment didn't offend you.
not at all.
my relationship just ended, too.
wow, really?
it must be something in the air.
he was the best thing that ever happened to me.
Yeah, well.
you know, February messes with people's heads.
here. A little more.
the problem is, it's all my fault.
I'm sure that's not true.
I was stupid, and I was drunk.
you know what people say?
they say, as long as you didn't cheat, everything is forgivable.
nobody's perfect.
right?
barkeep.
how's that new round coming?
you know, buddy, I think you've had enough.
how about I, uh, call you a cab?
there you go, sweetheart.
that's on the house.
killed a woman this time.
forensics match the blade?
body's been hacked to pieces.
dumped her in the trash.
maybe this is the woman that broke the unsub's heart.
parker: Name's Kelsey Ashwood.
she drove down from Santa Barbara last night.
husband's on his way to the field office.
the unsub didn't shoot her in the head like the others.
he started cutting her up while she was still alive.
he didn't castrate her, either.
this is anger on a whole other level.
he took his time with her.
if she wasn't the target of his rage, she definitely represents who is.
well, he's escalating.
it won't be long before he actually goes after the person that he blames for his loss.
what the hell?
I mean, you don't work here anymore.
you remember that, right?
some business I needed to deal with.
look, you can't be coming around like this.
andrea told me you showed up at Hunter's school.
that's none of your business.
well, it is my business because this is my business.
Hey, what are you doing here?
whose car is that?
a friend of mine. Didn't think you'd mind.
hell, did you steal a car?
is that why you've been coming around here?
I don't steal things, Doug.
you do.
I didn't steal anything.
OK. You gonna be giving them back, then?
Hey, look. I know the divorce has been hard on you.
but you need to get past it.
for everyone's sake.
just do the right thing.
do the right thing?
Yes.
do the right thing?!
coming from the guy who broke up my marriage, took away my kid?!
do the right thing.
you dirty- Aah! No!
I think you broke my back.
Mike, what are you doing?
turn off the machine.
Get-I'm not- for god's sake...
turn the damn thing off!
Mike! Mike! What...
I'm sorry, mike.
OK?
I didn't know. I didn't know!
I found out about Hunter the same time you did, Mike!
Mike, please! Help me, Mike! Mike, help me!
Mike! Mike! Mike, don't! No!
take your time.
why would someone do this to her?
that's what we're trying to find out.
I just want to hold her in my arms one more time.
the last thing we did was fight.
what was the fight about?
look, it's important that you be honest.
it could help us find the man that did this to her.
she slept with someone else.
she said it was just a one-time thing, but I- I just couldn't get past it.
not many people can.
I loved her so much.
but I couldn't fix us.
we were right.
all of the unsub's victims recently suffered the end of a romantic relationship, but they actually have something else in common.
each of the relationships ended due to infidelity?
how do you know that?
Kelsey Ashwood cheated on her husband.
all 5 of the male victims were businessman devastated by the destruction of the relationships.
they probably started acting out, which led to the losses we profiled earlier.
well, get this. Sean Taylor and Joe Kraus were the ones that cheated in their relationships.
they were the ones who were left exposed.
so he's showing sympathy to the men that were cheated on, yet anger toward the cheaters.
this is Dr. Reid.
all right, thanks.
Kelsey's car was found in a junkyard near Torrance.
somebody was in the compactor when it was crushed.
the victim is Doug Summers, owner of the wrecking yard.
the car was on top of him when it was crushed.
maybe he stumbled on the unsub in action.
this wasn't planned out like the others.
this was impulsive.
his entire M. O. has changed.
he wanted Doug to suffer.
Garcia, I need you to run background details on Doug Summers.
he runs the LB wrecking yard in Torrance.
checking.
uh, it seems clean as a whistle.
hold on.
his name's listed in a legal docket.
Mr. Summers is currently testifying in a custody battle between Michael Janeczko and Andrea Wright.
Janeczko used to work at the wrecking yard, and Wright is Mr. Summers' new fiancee.
she filed for divorce two months ago.
that's right when the killings started.
Where's Janeczko?
last known address was the house he shared with his former wife.
I don't understand. What does the FBI want with Michael?
we need to find him as soon as possible.
do you know where he's been staying?
he runs a bar on 2nd.
the owner's back east, so he's been sleeping in the loft above it.
please, what did he do?
he's a suspect in a murder investigation.
that's ridiculous.
we think he's been going through an emotional break.
he's been through a lot.
Prentiss: I'm afraid there's more.
ma'am, Doug Summers was killed earlier this morning.
what? What did you say?
I'm so sorry.
no.
not after all we've been through.
what have you been through?
you've documented Hunter's life with Michael and Hunter's life with Doug equally.
Why?
is Michael not hunter's father?
do they know the truth? - Yes.
when did they find out?
two months ago.
do you know where Hunter is now?
go ahead. I'll catch up.
what the hell? - We gotta go, now.
what are you doing here?
mom said you're not allowed to come.
I don't give a damn what your mother has to say.
get in the car!
I'm at school. I can't just leave.
I am your father, right?
if I say you can leave, then you can leave.
now... Get in, get in, get in.
tell me what's going on.
Yeah.
we gotta get out of town.
I'm not going anywhere! You're acting crazy.
look, I know things have been a little off between you and me lately, all right?
but...
everything is gonna be fine.
you are my son.
I am your father.
that is that.
I'm calling mom.
no, you are not!
she is not part of our life anymore.
do you understand me?
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to yell. I didn't.
what did you do?
is mom ok?
she's fine.
your mother is fine.
I need to tell Doug where we're going so mom doesn't freak out.
wait...
wait...
Dougie is dead.
what? What did you do?!
I didn't mean to!
I know how much he means to you!
I love you so much, son.
he just made me so mad.
you killed my father!
I am your father.
according to the ex-wife, Michael's been staying in the loft above the bar.
we got two floors to cover.
have your people maintain a perimeter around the building?
shouldn't we wait for S.W.A.T?
we're out of time.
hunter knows Michael's not his real father.
if he rejects him, Michael could lash out at whoever's closest, including Hunter.
all right, let's move.
daddy.
you don't love me.
FBI. Michael Janeczko, put the gun down.
he told me I wasn't his father.
I'm sure you didn't mean that.
right, Hunter?
you were frustrated.
I-I was hurt because of what happened to Doug.
that wasn't your fault, huh, Michael?
it was an accident.
I would never hurt my son.
tell him how you feel.
he raised you.
no matter what, he'll always be your real dad.
sure.
you were always there for me.
you're my dad.
put your weapon down.
you put yours down! Do it!
OK.
OK. Ok.
don't do it! Put it down!
hunter, give me the gun.
he killed Doug!
he was gonna kill me.
I know.
but if you pull that trigger, it is gonna be you going to prison and not him.
I didn't ask for any of this.
I know.
I know.
everything's gonna be ok.
all right? Look, you- you just gotta trust me.
OK?
please.
OK.
Spencer, I'm fine. I swear, it's just a scratch.
I don't know. I counted two cuts, 3 bruises, a black eye, and possibly a fractured rib.
I'm not telling you how to do your job, but you should probably consider giving her a CAT scan.
ignore him. - You ok?
Yeah, I will be.
what about him?
you may be deceived if you trust too much, but you will live in torment if you don't trust enough.
Frank Crane.
look, JJ, all I'm saying is I am never making you angry again.
I mean, who knew that Pennsylvania petite could give such an ass-whuppin'?
well, I'm just glad my hand-to-hand coach could work his schedule around my state department duties.
it's my pleasure.
I'm just really grateful it all paid off.
you were great out there.
I'm proud of you.
well, why don't you get your little butt home.
I'm sure Will's waiting on you.
Yeah, well, we did have dinner reservations, but, uh, I'm thinking we'll do takeout instead.
Thanks, Derek.
Yeah.
come in.
I thought I was the one supposed to be burning the midnight oil.
well, with Strauss away, the director asked me to do a little extra.
I'm actually looking forward to having her back.
right.
it's not the greatest way to spent Valentine's Day, now, is it?
I forgot, too.
some of the singles were gonna go find a bar and grab a drink, if you want to come along.
I mean, unless there's someplace else you could be.
uh, I think I'll pass, but thank you.
uh, what about the paperwork?
well, when Strauss comes back next week, I don't want her to be bored.
good night, Hotch. - Good night, Morgan.
flowers.
wow, thank you. - You're welcome.
it's not even Friday.
no, I know. I just get called away so often, I thought we should grab the opportunity while we had it.
that was very thoughtful.
let me get my stuff.
OK. So what's our plan?
well, I suppose I could tell you, but I don't want to spoil the surprise, so you'll just have to trust me.
my first mistake.
did you forget something?
this.
I thought we ought to get that out of the way.
spare us any awkwardness.
you don't have the market cornered on surprises, Aaron.
you know, it's not often that I'm speechless.
Really? - Yeah.
but I am now. - That's a nice car.
Yeah.
wh-- shh.
it's me.
Where's your cell phone?
in my backpack?
daddy, what are you doing?
someone's in the house.
who? - I don't know.
the power's out and my cell phone's downstairs.
where is it, Kenz?
Where's mom?
hiding in the bathroom with your sister.
now, I gotta go check on her.
Daddy--- You hide under the bed and call 911.
OK?
daddy!
come here.
Kenz, I'm gonna need you to be brave right now, OK?
can you do that for me?
you hide under there and call 911.
I love you so much.
I'll be back.
911. What's your emergency?
someone broke into our house.
please send help.
what's your address?
10058 Yucca Lane.
San Bernardino.
what's your name?
my dad told me to call.
Where's your dad now?
I don't know.
he had his gun.
mackenzie, listen to me.
stay calm.
the police are on their way.
please hurry!
is there someplace you can hide?
I'm under my bed.
No! No! Leave us alone!
mommy!
mackenzie, listen to me.
just listen to the sound of my voice.
Oh, my god. - Stay calm. Just breathe.
Mackenzie? Mackenzie, stay with me.
come on, now. Breathe.
that a girl. There you go.
nice and deep.
is there someone in your room?
Yes. - Just stay quiet.
I'm right here. I'm right here.
nice job, Valdez.
you just got your whole team killed.
sorry.
you're damn right you're sorry.
Franklin's wife is pregnant.
Maxwell over there just got engaged.
wedding's in May, right?
it's too bad you won't make it.
I thought I cleared the room.
you didn't check the door.
you missed the hidden threat.
I should have covered him.
no, Prentiss.
you're on point.
it's his job to cover you.
and when you don't do your job, Valdez, people die.
now, if you're not ready to shoulder that responsibility, then maybe you need to reconsider joining the bureau.
I said I was sorry, all right?
I heard you.
but out in the field, sorry doesn't bring people back.
we're done today.
Morgan. Is everything all right?
Yeah. Why?
you were a little hard on Valdez.
he's just a new agent trainee.
who made a fatal mistake.
well, he looks up to you.
I'm just saying, maybe you could build his confidence, not break it.
imagine how he'd feel if that had been real.
OK, yeah, I understand that.
but that course is designed to force failure.
that's how we learn.
and my job is to train the trainees, not to be their friend.
look, I know you're doing the tough love thing, but they don't know you like I do.
we got a heater.
going back to Cali, crime-fighters.
San bernardino, California.
two home invasions in less than a week, only a block apart.
exact same . both houses were burgled, power and phone lines cut, and they broke in through a back window.
in each case the entire family was shot and killed?
Yes, that is right.
I present to you the Mitchells and the Lewis family.
they took out the power and phones to isolate them.
the alarm systems wouldn't work and they can't call for help.
most modern alarm systems have a backup generator and a cell phone connection to the security company.
Yeah, but the Mitchells had an older system, and the Lewises were behind on their account, so it was inactive.
an assailant was killed in each case?
affirmative. But the sheriff hasn't identified them yet.
so both families were armed and fought back and shot one of their attackers.
is that a coincidence or a connection?
what concerns me is the frequency of the kills.
only 4 days apart.
right. It's a long flight.
wheels up in 30.
equality may perhaps be a right, but no power on earth can ever turn it into a fact." Honore De Balzac.
Brian Mitchell was an avid hunter.
Matt lewis was an Iraq war vet.
not surprising they both owned guns.
last year southern California's inland empire ranked fourth in the nation in foreclosure rates.
typically, as the economy falls, crime rates rise.
times are tough.
desperate people do desperate things.
greetings, all.
your herald bears tidings.
what you got, mama?
the sheriff identified both the dead home invaders.
first up is Alex Collison, 20.
made an impressive list of bad life decisions before he croaked, included but not limited to...
possession, a couple of drug charges, a card-carrying member of the Verdugo Heights Boys.
they' re gang members.
Oh, he was, but slow your roll, homegirl, because next up is Ronald Underwood, 19.
zero record, unless you want to count some volunteer work.
straight-a student, putting himself through school.
not exactly the home invasion type.
both from a poor area of town, grew up a mile apart.
hard to tell from the crime scene photos how many assailants there were.
well, if it was gang-related, there could be a lot of them.
the homes that got invaded were on the other side of town, a predominantly white area full of middle-class families.
Hey, guys, the M. E. Report just came in.
both of them had high levels of oxycodone in their systems.
that's strange.
violent crimes like these are normally associated with the stimulant drugs, like methamphetamines.
Underwood's as straight as an arrow.
Collison's a garden-variety gangbanger.
I grew up with knuckleheads like that.
high-risk break-ins and oxy, that's not their m. O.
regardless, we need to get ahead of it.
the press has got the community on the verge of panic.
JJ and I will coordinate with the sheriff's office.
I want the rest of you at the crime scenes.
if you remember anything at all, give us a call.
the neighbors say they've been trying to sell that house for almost a year.
apparently Matt Lewis was laid off and they were upside down on their mortgage.
nothing about that house says robbery.
a beat-up 8-year-old minivan in the driveway.
there's nothing fancy inside either.
violent hard-core burglars don't pick random targets.
so why these homes?
look at these people. They're terrified.
can you blame them?
well, half of them are moving.
the other half are joining the neighborhood watch.
this whole community is gonna be on edge until we catch these guys.
no, leave us alone!
someone broke into our house.
please send help.
mommy!
Mackenzie Lewis was the fourth and final victim.
she made the 911 call from under her bed.
the M. E. Didn't see any signs of a struggle, so he obviously dealt with her rather quickly.
ballistics confirmed that the rest of the Lewis family was shot with the exact same 357.
so if it was a gang, there was only one shooter.
the second and third victims were Trisha Lewis and 6-month-old Blake.
Matt Lewis was found right here, Ronald Underwood just over there.
underwood was shot 11 times in the head and abdomen.
but Lewis himself only had a single gunshot wound to the head at almost pointblank range?
how did someone get that close?
he could have been subdued first.
the M. E. Didn't see any signs of a blitz attack or struggle.
well, it had to be an ambush of some kind.
probably when he was confronting Underwood.
but that's almost impossible based on where the body was found.
it's right in the middle of the room.
it's too out in the open to surprise somebody.
Matt Lewis wasn't shot here.
no, but someone moved the body to make it look like he was.
forensic countermeasure designed to make us think these guys died in a gunfight that never occurred.
bullets and blood everywhere.
too messy for an accurate reconstruction.
Mr. Phillips, were you aware of Alex's gang affiliation?
it wasn't a secret.
the boy was wild.
been that way since his mother passed.
too much of his daddy in him.
so he was always in trouble?
not FBI trouble.
he ain't got the brains nor the work ethic.
kids have a way of hiding things.
agent hotchner, the boy smoked reefer, ran with the wrong crowd.
most of his time was spent on a stoop or in front of a TV.
I'm telling you, ain't no way on god's green earth he did what they say he did.
when was the last time you saw Ronald?
the night before last.
he came home from work, and he was running late for class.
I left him a plate.
but when I found it there the next morning, I knew something was wrong.
does he look familiar?
no. Never seen him.
were you aware of any gang affiliation your son may have had?
gang? - No.
it could have been just a friend in the neighborhood-- I said no.
OK. Have you never known him to do drugs?
excuse me?
madam, look, I'm very sorry.
I know this is very-- so you think because he was black and had tattoos, that he was in a gang and doing drugs?
the medical examiner found opiates in his system.
the other dead assailant was a known gang member.
madam, I am just trying to gain insight into who your son was.
well, here's some insight.
my son worked two jobs so he could put himself through school.
he was no thug on the corner!
my baby, he would never have done these things.
do you understand me?
you find out who did this to him.
OK, so the unsub gets the drop on Matt Lewis, kills the rest of the family, and then leaves a drugged-up patsy behind to cover his tracks?
this wasn't a burglary at all.
there was a higher purpose here.
they're staging the crime scene as some kind of message.
this guy's trying to make it look like black kids from the hood are killing white families in white neighborhoods.
a pretty powerful message.
homes are being invaded.
entire families are being slaughtered by common criminals.
I ask you, mayor Wennington, what are you doing about it?
because, Frankly, sir, from where I'm standing it doesn't seem like enough.
I'd like to respond to that.
Oh, please.
I should hope so, because crime rates have been on the rise ever since you took office.
and so have property taxes, I might add.
and how about you, Ms. Ross?
if you take office, do you have a plan to curb the violence on our streets?
I do. I will be happy to discuss it.
the victims of these heinous crimes fought back.
Why?
because no one would fight back for them.
but if you elect me, I will.
I won't let this become another Los Angeles, where the cancer of black and Latino gangs has taken over.
or salt lake, where 80% of drug-related felonies is committed by illegals.
this is our city.
it's time we take it back.
vamonos.
solo quiero uno de ustedes.
Necesito ayuda para mudarme.
Cincuenta dolares por dos horas.
Si.
de donde eres?
de guadalajara.
estas lejos de casa.
Esperame un momento. Tengo que sacar algo de baul.
same exact. Power and phone lines were cut, and he snuck in through a back window.
he's accelerating.
less than two days since the last break-in.
he was Pedro Mendez.
he had a Mexican driver's license on him.
Garcia checked him out.
wife, 3 kids.
no criminal record.
6 gunshot wounds to the chest and head.
it looks they were all from a 38 snub-nose.
and then over here...
Charles Nelson.
38 was registered in his name.
he unloaded the entire cylinder on that guy.
or we're supposed to think.
Where's the other body?
upstairs.
Karen Nelson.
she was due in a month.
well, he took the time to pull the sheet up and tuck her in.
remorse.
well, that would be a first.
why now?
the homeowners in each case were killed humanely.
he didn't want them to suffer.
but the fall guys he left behind were all shot multiple times--overkill, like it was personal.
but he modified his M. O. This time he wanted it to look like an undocumented immigrant was responsible.
these are hate crimes.
and the point is to incite racial tension and fear.
we believe we're looking for a white male in his late 20s to early 30s.
wait, wait, wait.
I'm sorry, I thought we were looking at black gangbangers.
the unsub has been staging the crime scenes to make it look like black gangs and undocumented immigrants were responsible.
why would anyone do that?
we think he's trying to create some sort of racial conflict.
in 1969, Charles Manson orchestrated the Tate-la Bianca murders in the hopes of creating a race war between the blacks and whites that he referred to as helter skelter.
a name he stole from a beatles song.
members of the Manson family left watermelon rinds at the scene of the crime and also painted panther paws on the wall in blood in the hopes of convincing authorities that the black panther party was responsible.
hate groups like the Aaryan nation believe that race war is not only inevitable, but necessary.
our unsub may be a member of one of these groups.
Aryan gangs have a strong presence in prisons, so he may be an ex-con or even possibly related to a convict.
Rossi: we think he may also be some kind of zealot.
he believes his war is already being fought.
and these murders are a mission to him.
and like a soldier, he is willing to put himself in harm's way.
reid: the unsub may also be vulnerable somehow-- weakminded or even lonely.
his cause gives him a sense of power and belonging.
he's physically fit enough to move dead bodies, so he's probably young.
but not so young as to be impulsive.
these attacks took planning and focus.
so, he's disciplined.
he uses oxycodone to drug his unwilling partners.
but he does so without killing them, which means he's knowledgeable about dosages.
and oxy is expensive, so look at medical care professionals and caregivers, anyone with access to prescription drugs.
this unsub is dedicated and driven.
it makes him especially dangerous.
surrender is not likely part of his strategy.
morning, sunshine.
beautiful day.
did you sleep ok?
Yeah, me, too.
I think I need a new mattress.
fixed your favorite oatmeal.
put in brown sugar.
I know how you like it.
here's a quick look at what we can expect the 5-day forecast to look like.
as you can see, it will be slightly on the cooler side of average, with temps in the mid to upper 50 with partly cloudy skies...
eggs? Mom, do you want eggs?
yeah? - Yeah.
so don't put away those winter jackets just yet.
back to you guys in the studio.
and with the mayoral race heating up, Clark Preston took time to walk the neighborhood recently hit by two brutal home invasions.
I'm here to support my community.
these people need to know that they're not alone.
Mr. Preston, what do you plan to do about it if elected?
what do I plan to do?
these people ask the dumbest questions.
I plan to cut these gangs out like a tumor.
we won't be terrorized in our own homes.
no, sir.
if I need to go door to door to personally send every one of them back where they came from.
I want my city back.
that's right!
I got this. I got this.
hang on.
hang on. Hang on.
Hey, Hotch. Check this out.
there's a mayoral race in town, and there's a guy named Clark Preston all over the news.
looks like he's running a close second.
these vicious home invasions are a sign of the times.
as demographics change, so do crime rates.
now, we may not be able to slow the browning of America, but we can sure as hell take our city back.
and if you elect me, I'll lead that charge.
the browning of America?
that's damn near hate speech.
he's using the murders to further his campaign and I guess people are rallying behind it.
so what if our unsub is nothing like Manson?
Manson never got his hands dirty.
what if our unsub is more like his followers?
you think he's being manipulated?
maybe even unintentionally, but either way, rhetoric like this could fuel his fire.
we should talk to Preston.
I already sent a car.
good.
I can't tell you how happy I am you're here, gentlemen.
maybe now someone will stop these savages.
what can I do to help?
we were hoping to talk to you about some of your rhetoric.
my rhetoric.
we believe the recent murders may be hate crimes.
some of the things you say, well, they may be construed as inflammatory.
agent Morgan's referring to some of your recent campaign speeches and the references to the murders.
we believe that whoever's responsible for these crimes is impressionable and may be responding to the vitriol.
you think I'm responsible?
nobody said that.
if this person is motivated by racist sentiments, then what you're saying publicly may be affecting him.
you're profilers, right?
right.
you study behavior, not actual facts.
and then you come up with theories.
it's not quite as simple as that.
I'll bet you had to work extra hard to get in the bureau, didn't you?
probably still have to prove yourself on a regular basis.
I respect that.
I wish there were more like you.
I'll cut back on my media appearances, for now.
but I suggest you start proving some of those theories of yours.
you two enjoy your day.
we should check out his list of contributors and his staff.
it might be somebody in his camp.
we need to check him out, too.
I'll send it first thing Monday.
Yes, yes, yes.
now please stop calling!
Hey, Trev, how you doing, buddy?
Clark! Ah, good to see you, man.
Hey, those debates the other day-- you were great!
Thanks.
I'm sorry I couldn't swing by after like we planned.
Oh, no, no, no.
I get it.
I mean, it's not like you're running for mayor or anything.
right?
I brought these for your mom.
it's her birthday next week, right?
you always remember.
Hey, uh, you hungry? I'm fixing lunch. You could come in and say hi.
she'd love to see you.
honest, I wish I had the time. I'm just in the neighborhood.
but you give her my love.
you bet.
Hey, listen. About the campaigning, I'm thinking maybe we down-shift a little bit.
have you seen the polls? We're losing.
I know. Still a lot of work to do.
Yeah, but we're changing minds, just like you said.
and we'll keep changing them.
but it's a chess game, Trev.
we gotta time our moves.
trust me.
trust me.
Hey, talk to me, dollface.
I got some dirt on your mayoral candidate, Clark Preston.
he's a politician.
that shouldn't be hard.
Yeah, he's a real estate lawyer who ran for city council last year and lost.
and he's rich.
as in, if money was dirt, he's filthy.
uh, he quadrupled his net worth in the last 10 years, mostly from real estate.
so he managed to thrive despite the area's economic downturn.
what do you mean by mostly?
well, he is on the board of several shadow financial institutions.
hedge funds, pension funds.
Oh, he likes to shuffle his money around.
even found some offshore accounts of his, I did.
you only do that if you're trying to hide it.
what about his staff and contributors.
no, they're all clean.
all right, thanks, Garcia. - Yeah.
Preston's a part of this.
I know he is.
you should have seen him in there.
he's a racist and a little shady, maybe, but a murderer?
it may be just a feeling, but I know he's in this.
we just need to figure out how.
Iayudame!
shot execution style just like all the others.
why put him in there?
there must be something symbolically important.
there's something inconsistent about the staging.
it's not remorse, and it's not a forensic countermeasure either.
each of these families were registered gun owners.
that must be how he's selecting his victims.
he wants them to fight back.
it's propaganda for his race war.
he's turning the families into martyrs.
and the fall guy takes the blame.
but now he's lost control because his fall guy got away, and he's devolving.
his name's Ramon Gomez.
he's an undocumented immigrant from Mexico city.
and he's pretty freaked out.
well, that's understandable.
was he able to give a description of the unsub?
just of the vehicle.
his English is not good.
we put an apb out.
Hola.
mi nombre es emily prentiss.
and please tell everybody that I appreciate all of their help.
sometimes I don't have a chance to do it personally, so it's really great what they do.
Hey, uh, clark, you got a second?
Becky, give me a minute, will you?
Trevor, you know better than to come here.
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. - We talked about this.
Yeah, I know, Clark, but, please, I really have to talk to you. - Not here. Not now.
but it's important.
I'll come by as soon as I can, but get the hell out of here, and don't ever come back.
Oh, yeah, yeah, ok.
that's much better.
that's much better. Now you have to turn these both around.
this signature. And then bring it...Get everyone in there.
there are approximately two hours between ramon's abduction here and his escape here.
he crossed the train tracks here.
now, given the time and distance parameters, there's no way the unsub could have ventured outside this radius.
OK, he said the train was close, and he heard laughter and loud music.
I looked at points of interest next to the train tracks and there really isn't much.
there's a warehouse, a taco stand that would have been closed, and a bar called the Drunken Dog.
why stop there? He need a drink?
he doesn't seem like the drinking type.
he's not impulsive or sloppy enough.
I live to serve you, sir.
Garcia, what can you tell us about a bar called the Drunken Dog?
Ooh, I like it already. Let's see.
uh, it's been around 30 years.
it was opened by a warehouse worker named Manny Gresham.
upon his death 6 years ago, it was bought by a hedge fund company called first advantage.
why would a hedge fund company want a bar?
let's see. Well, they bought it for a song, and, poor man, his medical expenses bankrupted him.
I guess that's why-- shut the front door.
Clark Preston is on the board of first advantage, which explains why the bar is on a short list of local businesses that support Preston for mayor.
Uh...Hey, clark, uh, it's me again.
I did everything like you said, just like we planned it, but something, something went wrong.
I don't know what to do.
would you call me back!
please?
OK, we missed something.
we need to go back over his staff and contributors again.
they all came up clean.
Hey, Garcia, look up DMV records and find every registration in the area that matches the description of the unsub's vehicle.
OK, 79 names, and I'm way ahead of you.
none of them match anyone on Preston's team.
what the what? Oh, I'm good at my job.
a Pamela Mills donates monthly to preston's campaign.
her son Trevor, his car matches the description, and it's registered in his name.
got a photo and an address?
Yes, I do.
I also have a place of work for Trevor.
he is a part-time messenger. I'm sending it now.
all right, JJ, Morgan, and Prentiss take the workplace, we'll take the house.
and now in political news, with the mayoral race heating up, we caught up with candidate Hilary Ross.
her comments on the recent home invasion...
I know. I miss them, too.
ms. Ross, Ms. Ross, what can you tell us about the recent rash of home invasion murders?
well, our community has healing to do.
it's gonna take hard work and time to fix.
it won't be easy, you stupid bitch!
healing?
I know, right?
she doesn't have what it takes.
we are under siege here, and what is she gonna do?!
Hotch: what have you got, Garcia?
sir, I found the connection between the Mills family and Clark Preston.
10 years ago, the Mills were the victims of a home invasion.
robert Mills, the father, and 10-year-old Julie were killed.
Pamela was raped, and now she has a lot of brain damage that has left her in a near vegetative state.
what about Trevor?
mom!
he hid in the closet, and when it was over, he called 911.
that's why he stuffed that boy in the closet.
he was reliving his own victimization.
he didn't do that to the other children he murdered because he didn't relate to them.
Garcia, was anybody convicted of the crime? - Yes.
a Ronnie Green and Carlos Jackson.
they're both African American, both serving life in Folsom.
and then after the murders, Preston, he financially supported the family almost entirely.
so they're close.
he's known the family for years.
that must be how they're paying Pamela's medical expenses.
it would be awfully hard to cover that on a part-time messenger's salary.
Yeah, I mean, it's a top-flight policy.
so Preston is playing the savior.
and it looks like that monthly donation that Pamela makes to Preston's campaign is her disability check.
my guess is Trevor authorized that because he feels beholden to Preston.
he probably idolizes him.
so Preston is manipulating the Mills family to further his own agenda.
he's behind everything.
he took advantage of Trevor when he was weak and vulnerable.
he gains his trust, then he brainwashes him.
turned him into a killer.
uh, guys, there's something else.
house is empty.
he's not here, but I found this in his bedroom.
it's addressed to her.
the price of peace is sacrifice.
and I'm prepared to pay that price, no matter how high. I hope you'll still love me.
this is a good-bye letter.- Or a suicide note.
he doesn't profile as suicidal.
no, but he knows this could be his final mission.
he may want to go out in a blaze of glory.
it's all about the election.
he's only got one move left.
we need to secure mayor Wennington.
have the rest of the team find Hilary Ross.
hello. You have reached Hilary Ross, please leave a detailed message.
she's still not answering.
Yeah, Morgan.
we're on our way to Hilary Ross' house now.
she's still not answering her phone.
all right, call local police.
he's not going to go quietly.
do you have mayor Wennington?
Yeah. Keep me posted.
you got it.
hello. You've reached Hilary Ross.
I'm still getting nothing.
that's her car.
all right, you two go around back.
I'll draw his fire while you flank him.
you sure you want to split up?
we gotta cover the back and the front in case he runs.
let's go.
you're hit!
I'm good. Go, go!
he's upstairs.
get in here!
Trevor Mills! FBI! Drop the weapon! It's over!
get away from me!
Trevor, you don't want to do this.
let me help you or you're gonna die.
you help me?
Yeah, right!
I know about Peston.
I know that he put you up to all of this.
you damn half-breed!
you don't know anything!
Trevor, we pulled your phone records.
you called Preston 13 times today.
so what?!
we pulled his voicemail messages, too.
he's using you, kid.
that's why he won't call you back.
get out of here or I'll kill this bitch!
listen to me.
just listen.
when those men broke in your house, you know who ended up buying it?
it was your man Preston.
and he got it for nothing.
you're a liar!
all you people do is you lie!
the men convicted of killing your family, they both said somebody paid them off to do that job.
they just couldn't prove it.
so now they're doing life.
Yeah, well, they should have gotten the chair!
come on, Trevor, wake up.
Preston set that up.
crime waves hit, property value drops.
then Preston moves in and buys it all up for cheap.
shut up!
Trevor, listen to me.
he doesn't give a damn about black or white.
the only color that son of a bitch cares about is green.
come on, kid, you gotta believe me.
drop the gun.
you let her go, we can work it out.
he told me you would try to turn me.
there are no traitors!
voicemail messages?
that's ludicrous.
that boy is mentally unstable.
he always has been.
Clark Preston, you have the right to remain silent. - I'm innocent.
and please feel free to exercise that right.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
you have the right to an attorney.
if you cannot afford one, an attorney will be appointed for you.
I'm for truth, no matter who tells it.
I'm for justice, no matter who it's for or against." Malcolm x.
how you doing?
I'm all right.
Emily... I'm so sorry.
out there in the field, sorry doesn't bring people back.
come on, I'm messing with you.
it's nothing, really.
I'm ok.
this isn't your fault.
actually, it is.
you're a team leader.
you made a tactical decision.
and you got hurt. Again.
you did what you thought was right.
and that's all you can do.
the rest of it, that's not up to us.
that's the job.
this is nothing, really.
I mean, the thing with Doyle, that...
I'm kidding!
I'm...
I want to hear some new blood flowing down into my broken feet
I want to hear my proud lungs banging out when I hit the street
you ok?
Yeah. I just need some fresh air.
I'm going to, uh, I'm gonna run around a little bit.
I'm gonna be as good as new.
are we home?
not yet, buddy. Go back to sleep, ok?
he's a goofball.
he fainted.
Matt. - Dad
whoo, I got you.
my heart is racing.
what is it?
car just stopped.
must be the battery.
stop fooling around.
no, I'm serious.
the car will not start.
at least turn the lights on.
mom's afraid of the dark.
no, I'm not.
I got you.
I got you.
sorry for the cryptic late-night text, but I promised I'd fill you in on the way here, and I am a girl who keeps her promises, so, this boy was found two hours ago in the middle of nowhere.
technically he was found outside of Crockett, Arizona.
my point is, he has clearly been to super hell and escaped some sort of captivity.
how do we know he wasn't just dropped off there?
well, he has fresh cuts on the bottom of his feet from the local cactus fields, and that's away from any through roads.
and his skin is rubbed raw around his ankles from chains.
he must've had a chance to escape and he took it.
or the unsub could have had him in transit.
my God, you guys, look at his eyes.
Yeah, he's jaundiced.
probably hasn't seen daylight in a while.
Yeah, and there's a lot of scars here.
and those are the ones we can see.
it's hard to tell for certain, but he's maybe 13.
are there any missing children in the area, Garcia?
none until now, but, sir, you may have more information than I do.
I do. Earlier tonight another boy was reported missing in Flagstaff.
that's not that far.
it can't be a coincidence.
technically it could, but Arizona has the lowest abduction rate in the country, so the chances of these cases not being related are ridiculously slim.
Yeah. That's why child abduction rapid deployment will meet you on the ground.
the Flagstaff abduction is Billy Henderson, 13.
his parents say he was coming back from a friend's house after dinner.
he never made it.
OK, they set up roadblocks, but the unsub has a head start.
right now our best chance of finding Billy Henderson is to figure out what the first victim knows.
exactly.
so, Morgan, you and JJ go to the hospital, see if you can get through to him.
the rest of us will set up at the police station.
losing his victim has likely enraged the unsub.
no telling what he'll do to Billy.
No! Please!
please... Please, no!
"memory is a complicated thing, a relative to truth, but not its twin." Barbara Kingsolver.
apparently Billy was riding his bike home from his friend's house last night.
they find the bike?
no, the unsub was smart enough to cover his tracks.
and he has the guts to take a good kid from a decent neighborhood.
Billy left his friend's house at 8: 20 p. m. The ride home was less than a half a mile.
you're on speaker, Garcia.
OK, I got the whole gang on.
it looks like the first victim was definitely held in captivity in Crawford, Arizona.
why is that?
because a woman walked in to Crawford P. D.this morning, says she remembers a boy in chains, in Crawford, 30 years ago, just like the boy found last night.
is she still at the station?
no. She dropped that bomb of information and then she took off.
what's her name?
most documents have her listed as Sam Allen.
36, never married, born and raised and lived her whole life in Crawford, owns and operates a nursery, the plant kind, not the baby kind.
mother died when she was 5, dad's a real estate developer.
is there security footage?
Yes. I'm sending that to you.
it's on your tablets right now.
what's she looking at?
I can't tell.
what happened?
it looks like she was spooked.
Dave, you and Prentiss see if you can find Samantha Allen.
Reid and I will get set up at the station.
all we can hope is that Morgan and JJ get through to the survivor.
you can't examine the scars?
I can't get close enough.
he has the most severe case of C. E.R. I've ever seen.
conditioned emotional response.
I've only seen it in vets.
that's worse than PTSD.
he had an adrenaline rush when he escaped, but coming down from that will be just as extreme.
and I'm sure he's sensitive to light and sound.
incredibly. We're keeping it as quiet and dark as possible.
it's probably what he's used to.
he's also been somewhere cramped.
his legs show signs of advanced arthritis.
any idea how old he is?
it's hard to tell.
his growth has been stunted.
he's got major tooth and skin decay, clearly from a massive vitamin D deficiency.
best guess.
maybe 16.
my name's Derek.
I'm one of the good guys.
and this is my friend.
I'm Jennifer.
you're safe now.
doctor says you haven't been eating much.
food looks pretty good.
you must be thirsty.
here you go.
it's ok. It's ok. It's ok.
JJ, this is years of conditioning.
have Garcia go back to 2000 for missing kids.
Yeah.
detective, I'm Agent Hotchner.
detective Perez.
this is Dr. Reid.
I thought your team was bigger.
the rest are following other leads.
is Card retracing the escape route that the boy in chains took?
they have been canvassing all night.
there's another team in Flagstaff retracing Billy Henderson's bike ride.
where are Billy's parents? - In the chief's office.
thank you.
detective, you talked to Sam Allen over here and it looked like one of these photos upset her.
do you have any idea why?
Yeah, well, it's weird.
why is that?
because most of these people have passed away.
that's our old chief.
that one there.
he built the station and some of the houses around here.
it's J. B. Allen, Sam's father.
hi there.
can I help you?
we're with the FBI.
we heard you were at the police station earlier.
I told the other detectives, that was a mistake.
why did you leave the station when you saw your father's photo?
I didn't.
we saw the security footage.
you told them you saw a boy in chains when you were a kid.
why do you think your father had something to do with this?
he doesn't. I never said that.
my father is a good man.
this isn't about him, ok?
I told the other detective, I made a mistake.
you know what I think?
I think you saw the news coverage of that little boy they found last night and it triggered something.
if you know anything that can help us and you're keeping it to yourself, that's as horrendous as what's happening to those children.
look, I'm sorry.
I really, really am.
but I - - I - - I can't help you.
come on, Randy.
listen, I know how scared you are.
I know you think he can still hurt you, that he's just outside that door.
but I promise you he's not.
even if he was, he'd have to get through me to get to you, and I'm not about to let that happen.
so it sounds like Billy's always been cautious.
he's our oldest.
and he follows the rules.
it drives his little sister crazy because she's the opposite.
and he rides his bike a lot?
all the time. - Even at night?
he's got lights and reflectors.
he even has a head lamp on his helmet.
we used to ride with him, but he's 13.
he was only two streets over.
and you feel pretty certain that he wouldn't go anywhere with a stranger?
no. No way. Never.
if someone asked for help, would he stop?
hold on. Are you saying that Billy was taken because he's polite?
I'm not saying that it's his fault or yours.
Billy is a cautious child, and that will be his strength right now.
she left after seeing a photo of her father? Did she accuse him?
no, the opposite. She protected him.
Garcia ran her mental health history.
she had some grief counseling after her mother died, but other than that, no therapy.
we can talk to her, but we can't force her to help.
no, but something in her gut brought her in here.
if there's any truth to her instincts, there's gonna be some kind of a record of a missing boy from 30 years ago.
well, have Garcia check unsolved cases and also check into J. B. Allen's history.
we can't rule anybody out. - Ok.
how are Morgan and JJ doing with the boy?
he's so traumatized, he can't even speak.
give me everything you have on J. B. Allen also, all of the unsolved missings.
you know what? Go back to 1980 just to cover bases. Thanks, Garcia.
it's ok. It's ok.
what did Garcia find out?
she broadened her search, but nothing that matches his description.
somebody's gotta be missing this kid.
no, hey, hey, no. no, no. That's not for us. That's not for us.
it's for the doctors outside.
it's for the doctors, not for us. It's all right.
it's ok. It's not for us.
there you go. Come on back. Here.
just take it.
there you go.
I, um, I got him to nod, but...not much more than that.
and you asked him his name?
Yeah.
what about in Spanish?
it doesn't matter the language if he won't talk.
what's your name, sweetheart?
can I see what you have there?
do you like eagles?
Yeah, the wings are - - are beautiful, aren't they?
your back?
wings?
wings on your back.
angel?
is your name Angel?
so, softball, basketball, and soccer.
you played a lot of team sports.
was your dad a coach?
no.
he was always too busy with work.
I guess that's why he kept me busy.
it was ok, though.
the house was too quiet after mom died.
she had cancer.
I didn't really know what that meant growing up, just that ...
she wasn't gonna get any better.
OK.
let's start with today.
what brought you in here?
I saw that ... that boy on the news.
and I saw, um ... I can't really explain it.
is - - it was like a movie in fast-forward.
it was dark.
so dark.
and that - - that little boy, he had the same chains on his ankles.
and then it was over.
those flashes that I saw.
that boy ... Was he real?
that's what we need to find out.
Thanks, JJ.
is the boy talking?
no, but they figured out that his name is Angel.
Garcia sent a list of all missing kids since 1980 with a concentration in southwest US.
most are runaways.
all right, let's eliminate the runaways and focus on lower-risk victims.
whoever's doing this likes the challenge.
here's the thing. This unsub is too controlled to let his victims escape.
I think Angel must have gotten away because he was being transferred somewhere.
I'm running out of options here.
the state troopers are eliminating roadblocks, and Card is coming up empty.
if J. B. Allen is a suspect, why aren't we just kicking down his door?
because it's too risky.
if Allen is who we're looking for, he has a psychiatric disorder that drives everything he does.
he'll do whatever it takes to hide Billy, but he'll sacrifice him if it means protecting his own freedom.
everything that this unsub does is methodical.
he had a secure place to keep Angel for years, but when Angel escaped, he didn't mourn his loss.
he drove straight to Flagstaff.
the questions is, why did he choose Flagstaff?
he'd only drive 60 miles out of his way if he knew someone was there to make him feel better.
we don't think that Billy was a victim of opportunity.
we think he was the target.
so this isn't a stranger abduction.
chances are he'd seen Angel before, too.
the question is, where would he have access to both of these children?
who should we be looking at?
friends, neighbors, coaches, other parents.
we believe that this man has met Billy before.
what?
you're saying this son of a bitch watched my son?
I'm say he talked to him long enough to earn his trust.
but the other little boy, the one that you just found,
I mean, why don't you ask him who's doing this?
he's not talking to us yet.
Oh, my God.
well, what happened to him?
Oh, my God!
that's right. That's right. Bring it over.
angel, that's pretty good, my man. You got it. Keep going.
OK, please tell me you found something.
I want to tell you that.
JJ, there's not a single kid in the tri-state area who's gone missing whose name is Angel.
I did a nationwide search. Still zilch.
why wouldn't he be reported missing?
you tell me.
there's a lot of undocumented workers in Arizona.
Yes, I know. I've pulled harvest schedules already.
but what about school registrations?
there are more Angels than you think.
we think he's been held for a long time.
did any of them drop out during grade school?
go back to at least 2004.
2004 ... Second-grader Angel Suarez.
you got a picture? - Yes.
and if I run my simulation software to age him 8 years ...
he'd be the boy that's in the room with you right now. It's him, JJ.
you are amazing. Thank you.
can you send - - Yes.
send his mother's information to you right now.
you're the best. Bye.
that sounded like good news.
I'm about to call Angel's mom. He's responding to Morgan.
it won't be long before he's talking.
OK, Angel, the Doc's here. You want me to stay?
all right, I'll be right outside.
OK.
Hey, Angel.
you're doing great.
your mom will be so happy to see you.
OK. It's ok. We can start again.
I'd like you to close your eyes.
please. Close your eyes.
concentrate on your breathing.
OK. You said it was dark.
you were in your pajamas.
Yes.
I was burning up.
you probably had a fever.
what did you do?
I called out for my mom, but she wasn't strong enough, so I got into bed with her.
was your dad there?
no. - Did you hear anything?
my mom's breathing.
was she having trouble?
Yes. It's a strange sound.
was there another noise in the house?
there's something else, but I can't see anything.
I followed it. My feet are so cold.
because you were outside?
no. The basement.
I see him.
no, I was too scared.
no, no. I'd go back up to my parents' bedroom.
mommy. Mommy.
but I peeked out the window.
and there's the boy.
what is he doing?
he's trying to get out of that truck.
he's trying to get out of ...
is your dad driving the truck?
no, no, no.
he couldn't have done this.
you don't understand.
he raised me in that house.
he couldn't have been doing that all these years.
no - Ok. Ok.
J. B.'S friends with the whole town.
never remarried.
raised Sam by himself.
that's why this is so painful for her.
she doesn't want to believe that he's capable of it, but her memory's telling her differently.
so you believe her?
it's very hard to fake visceral reactions like that.
Yeah, but she's talking about a time of serious trauma, on a night she climbed into bed with her dying mother.
that plus her age, it's the perfect storm for a recovered memory.
wasn't that a huge therapy trend in the eighties?
a lot of women manufactured memories of their fathers doing horrific things.
and misguided therapists convinced them that their nightmares were real.
it was a huge waste of our resources.
I'm, uh, just not sure about this.
I think she's credible enough to warrant discreet rolling surveillance.
you'll have to use your own team, cause he'd recognize members of this force.
if he has Billy, he won't hesitate to get rid of him.
I'll get a Card team member to join Reid.
allen can't know we suspect him.
you know, if J. B. Allen is our unsub, he certainly doesn't seem unhinged.
he went to the market today, and he stopped by his daughter's nursery, and right now I'm watching him landscaping.
at his house? - Yeah.
is it isolated?
incredibly isolated. There's a lot of land.
you remember what Garcia sent us on J. B. Allen?
he started his contracting business in 1975, married Sam's mom that same year.
she died when Sam was 5, as we know.
he never remarried, and despite the newer subdivisions he built, he stayed in the house he shared with his wife.
so he's either sentimental, or he didn't sell because he's customized the house to hide his victims.
do you think Angel blames himself?
I know I did.
you know, seeing his mom for the first time may not go well.
well, right now it's just about the shame he's feeling.
she's gonna have to realize that he may not want to see her.
angel? Angel! Angel, no, no! Angel, no, no! Angel, stop!
stop! Stop! Stop!
it's ok. JJ, get a towel. It's ok.
angel, listen to me.
you're safe.
you're safe. It's ok. Angel, you're safe.
it's all right.
please. He's right there. I have to.
I have to see him.
I thought he was gone all these years.
my sweet boy.
don't you understand?
I need to hold him.
OK. Listen.
angel hasn't been held in a very long time.
things happened to him.
he's going to have a hard time at first.
come on.
I know this isn't easy for you.
if I accuse him and he's done nothing... Then I've betrayed him.
but if he has, you'll save a young boy.
the best way for you to recover more of your memory is to return to the source of the initial sensory trigger.
that was the basement.
how do I explain going down there?
did he have anything of yours down there?
Yeah.
see if you can get it back.
help! Help! Help!
please help me!
I have to help my boy.
and you will.
but first, we need your help.
someone else's little boy is missing.
we're trying to find out how this man knew both your son and Billy, and to do that, I need to know everything that happened the day Angel disappeared.
it was a Tuesday, after school.
the children were in the front yard.
it started raining, but Angel never came back in.
did you see anyone talking to them?
no. No cars. Nothing.
the neighbors - - the neighbors helped me look.
I wanted to tell the authorities.
I really did.
but - - but we'd have to leave the country and I had to think of my entire family.
you just have to talk to him, Sam.
you can do this.
right.
dad? You home?
back here!
the yard looks good.
Oh, thanks.
the kids at the store said you were going to Phoenix, but I saw your truck down at the police station.
Oh, yeah.
their order for potted palms came in, so I just - - I dropped it off at the station.
chili. You want a bowl?
it smells great, dad, but I can't stay.
since when?
it's my chili.
he's not trying to get her out of there.
not yet.
Hey, is my old catcher's mitt still down in the basement?
Yeah. Why?
I was thinking about coaching softball down at the Rec.
yeah?
that's great.
you still got the homerun record, you know.
Yeah, I know.
that practice paid off, huh?
is it, uh, it's still in the bin?
Yeah. Let me get it.
no, no, no, that's ok. I got it.
uh - - uh, I don't think so.
I got boxes everywhere.
I've been trying to sort through some things.
I'm thinking of having a yard sale next week.
you want in?
sounds good, but come on.
I can get it.
suit yourself.
he let her go down there.
Yeah, but he hesitated.
he's not acting like he's got something to hide, Emily.
that's how he's gotten away with it.
we don't know that.
you find it?
cause it's right over here.
Thanks.
told you it was a mess down here.
Yeah. Yeah.
you sure you can't stay?
Yeah. I'm not feeling great, and I gotta get up early tomorrow.
you going to Phoenix?
uh, pickups, deliveries. It'll be a long one.
OK, then.
see you later, Peanut.
later, Dad.
I'm so sorry. - It's ok.
you did everything we asked.
there was nothing in the basement. I'm sorry.
now all we've got is the kid.
it's called a challenge coin, Angel.
legend says an American pilot in World War I was gunned down over Germany.
and he crawled, across no-man's-land into French territory.
he was desperate to survive.
and he should have been safe, except that the French thought he was a German.
and he was almost executed.
but he showed them a coin.
it had his squadron's insignia on it.
it was given to him by a fellow pilot so that they would never forget what they shared.
what happened to him?
a French soldier recognized the insignia.
and they set him free.
angel, the man who took you took another boy and we have to find him.
can you help us do that?
angel ... I want you to have this.
it's kept me safe.
listen ...
that's the name of the man who hurt me.
I was just a young boy like you, Angel.
and I thought about doing that very same thing to myself. I did.
because the shame was too much.
but instead, I kept the pain buried inside of me.
and it tore me apart.
but, Angel, I never let that son of a bitch beat me.
I never gave him that.
I want to make this man pay for what he's done to you.
but I need your help.
I promise you that whoever hurt you will not win.
you and me together can take away what he kept from you and what he values the most, and that's freedom.
angel, please.
will you help me do that?
yes
can you tell us if any of these men look familiar?
no. It was always too dark.
I'm so sorry.
how do you feel?
like I failed.
you didn't.
I failed him.
I actually thought he could have done all of this.
I think it took more than a buried memory to come in here.
there is something about your father's behavior, things he has said and done that have bothered you for a long time.
you buried those.
just like the memory.
look ... You lost your mother when you were very young.
it would have been too devastating to lose your father as well.
repressing those memories is a defense mechanism.
what else did I bury?
his mood swings, probably.
do you remember when he was happy one day, angry the next?
Yeah.
and when his moods were extreme, did he give you gifts?
how do you know that?
what did he give you?
a bike, once.
was that one that you had asked for?
no. It was a - - it was a BMX.
any others?
my catcher's mitt from today.
what did he do?
you can tell me.
he used to ... He used to bite me.
he hasn't for a while.
but he did ... He did other things.
will you let the doctor take a look?
maybe we can match dental records.
OK.
what about a few years ago?
in 2004, did he give you anything?
that's the year he gave me Randy.
Randy?
my - - my dog.
he was just a puppy then.
guys, Sam's father gave her gifts, trophies, from each abduction.
that's significant.
I didn't know that's what they were.
we need to find out if Angel had a puppy the day he was taken.
a puppy?
Yeah.
Ohh ... That's right.
some of the neighbors were giving them away that day.
they had a whole box.
but I wouldn't let the boys keep one.
Hotch, you hear that?
Yes. Thanks, JJ.
uh, wait, Hotch.
um ... We're trying to get a dental match.
he's got oldbite marks.
what is it?
Oh, my ... My dad has his teeth recapped a few years ago.
he said something like, that's what happens when you get older or whatever.
he made a joke about it.
you better not give me any trouble.
No! No!
we're heading to Allen's house.
you think he's got a secondary location?
he could, but guys like him keep their victims close.
we'll search every inch of the property.
keep us posted. - Will do.
JJ. What's going on?
they're going to find J. B. Allen.
angel said it was always dark.
he must have had him underground somewhere.
it's a big property. Let's keep looking.
Oh, God.
it's clear.
his truck's still here. He may be, too.
he wouldn't risk it. He's gotta have another vehicle.
I'll get the roadblocks back up.
any idea where he would go?
someplace that feels like home.
let's go.
you're on speaker, Garcia.
so I tracked J. B. Allen's property developments over the last 30 years.
they're all over the map - - well, of Arizona, anyway.
sending it to you now. Hope you can make more sense of it than I can.
Thanks, Garcia.
the one thing that your memory and Angel's escape have in common is he was getting rid of both boys.
he would only do that if he had another boy waiting in the wings.
that means he met his victims before.
how?
I mean, they're hours apart.
look at the towns. He had subdivisions in all of them.
construction sites are a magnet for 10 to 12-year-old boys.
he ... He gave kids a ride on the backhoe all the time.
they would just line up for it.
Oh, my God.
I - - I - - I didn't know.
we found his target-rich environment.
the construction sites?
Yeah.
see if Sam remembers a particular one that he took her to frequently.
just one place?
he keeps his victims for years.
the burial sites would be someplace special, and he'd need a reason to revisit.
is there a favorite place your dad likes to go?
you mean like the lake or something?
no. Most likely having to do with his work.
somewhere he's proud of?
his first development.
where is that?
in Mesa. Every few years he adds on to it.
he adds another house?
he says that it's the place that reminds him how he got started.
it set the foundation for everything.
did you hear that?
loud and clear.
please! Somebody!
help me! Help! Help!
No! No! No
come on. It's ok. You're all right. You're ok.
Morgan, that's enough!
that's enough!
are you ready, Angel?
Yeah.
do you always keep them with you?
Yeah.
but the one I gave Angel was the only one that had wings on it.
you know Angel's never gonna let that go.
what you shared, I know that wasn't easy.
none of this is easy.
I can't help but picture little Morgan.
you were so alone.
I'm here right now because of what that man did to me.
I know.
I'm just ... sorry.
"nothing fixes a thing so intensely in the memory as the wish to forget it." Michel de Montaigne.
you ok? Yeah. I just need some fresh air.
I'm going to, uh, I'm gonna run around a little bit.
I'm gonna be as good as new.
are we home?
not yet, buddy. Go back to sleep, ok?
he's a goofball.
he fainted.
Matt. Dad!
whoo, I got you. My heart is racing.
what is it? Car just stopped.
must be the battery. Stop fooling around.
no, I'm serious. The car will not start.
at least turn the lights on. Mom's afraid of the dark.
no, I'm not.
I got you.
Hi, hi, hi. Sorry for the cryptic late-night text, but I promised I'd fill you in on the way here, and I am a girl who keeps her promises, so, this boy was found two hours ago in the middle of nowhere.
technically he was found outside of Crockett, Arizona.
my point is, he has clearly been to super hell and escaped some sort of captivity.
how do we know he wasn't just dropped off there?
well, he has fresh cuts on the bottom of his feet from the local cactus fields, and that's away from any through roads.
and his skin is rubbed raw around his ankles from chains.
he must've had a chance to escape and he took it. Or the unsub could have had him in transit.
my God, you guys, look at his eyes.
Yeah, he's jaundiced. Probably hasn't seen daylight in a while.
Yeah, and there's a lot of scars here. And those are the ones we can see.
it's hard to tell for certain, but he's maybe 13.
are there any missing children in the area, Garcia?
none until now, but, sir, you may have more information than I do.
I do. Earlier tonight another boy was reported missing in Flagstaff.
that's not that far. It can't be a coincidence.
technically it could, but Arizona has the lowest abduction rate in the country, so the chances of these cases not being related are ridiculously slim.
Yeah. That's why child abduction rapid deployment will meet you on the ground.
the Flagstaff abduction is Billy Henderson, 13.
his parents say he was coming back from a friend's house after dinner. He never made it.
OK, they set up roadblocks, but the unsub has a head start.
right now our best chance of finding Billy Henderson is to figure out what the first victim knows.
exactly. So, Morgan, you and JJ go to the hospital, see if you can get through to him.
the rest of us will set up at the police station.
losing his victim has likely enraged the unsub.
no telling what he'll do to Billy.
No!
please! Please...
please, no!
memory is a complicated thing, a relative to truth, but not its twin.
apparently Billy was riding his bike home from his friend's house last night.
they find the bike?
no, the unsub was smart enough to cover his tracks.
and he has the guts to take a good kid from a decent neighborhood.
Billy left his friend's house at 8: 20 p. m.
the ride home was less than a half a mile.
you're on speaker, Garcia. Ok, I got the whole gang on.
it looks like the first victim was definitely held in captivity in Crawford, Arizona.
why is that? Because a woman walked in to Crawford P. D.
this morning, says she remembers a boy in chains, in Crawford, 30 years ago, just like the boy found last night. Is she still at the station?
no. She dropped that bomb of information and then she took off.
what's her name? Her name's Samantha Allen.
most documents have her listed as Sam Allen.
36, never married, born and raised and lived her whole life in Crawford, owns and operates a nursery, the plant kind, not the baby kind.
mother died when she was 5, dad's a real estate developer.
is there security footage? Yes. I'm sending that to you.
it's on your tablets right now. What's she looking at?
I can't tell.
what happened? It looks like she was spooked.
Dave, you and Prentiss see if you can find Samantha Allen.
Reid and I will get set up at the station.
all we can hope is that Morgan and JJ get through to the survivor.
you can't examine the scars? I can't get close enough.
he has the most severe case of C. E.R. I've ever seen.
conditioned emotional response.
I've only seen it in vets. That's worse than PTSD.
he had an adrenaline rush when he escaped, but coming down from that will be just as extreme.
and I'm sure he's sensitive to light and sound.
incredibly. We're keeping it as quiet and dark as possible.
it's probably what he's used to. He's also been somewhere cramped.
his legs show signs of advanced arthritis. Any idea how old he is?
it's hard to tell. His growth has been stunted.
he's got major tooth and skin decay, clearly from a massive vitamin D deficiency.
best guess.
maybe 16.
my name's Derek. I'm one of the good guys.
and this is my friend. I'm Jennifer.
you're safe now.
doctor says you haven't been eating much.
food looks pretty good.
you must be thirsty.
here you go.
it's ok. It's ok. It's ok.
JJ, this is years of conditioning.
have Garcia go back to 2000 for missing kids.
Yeah.
detective, I'm Agent Hotchner. Detective Perez.
this is Dr. Reid. I thought your team was bigger.
the rest are following other leads.
is CARD retracing the escape route that the boy in chains took?
they have been canvassing all night.
there's another team in Flagstaff retracing Billy Henderson's bike ride.
in the chief's office. Where are Billy's parents?
thank you.
detective, you talked to Sam Allen over here and it looked like one of these photos upset her.
do you have any idea why?
Yeah, well, it's weird. - Why is that?
because most of these people have passed away. That's our old chief.
that one there. He built the station and some of the houses around here.
it's J. B. Allen, Sam's father.
hi there. Can I help you? We're with the FBI.
we heard you were at the police station earlier.
Oh. I told the other detectives, that was a mistake.
why did you leave the station when you saw your father's photo?
I didn't. We saw the security footage.
you told them you saw a boy in chains when you were a kid.
why do you think your father had something to do with this?
he doesn't. I never said that. My father is a good man.
this isn't about him, ok?
I told the other detective, I made a mistake.
you know what I think?
I think you saw the news coverage of that little boy they found last night and it triggered something.
if you know anything that can help us and you're keeping it to yourself, that's as horrendous as what's happening to those children.
look, I'm sorry. I really, really am.
but I-I- I can't help you.
come on, Randy.
listen, I know how scared you are.
I know you think he can still hurt you, that he's just outside that door.
but I promise you he's not.
even if he was, he'd have to get through me to get to you, and I'm not about to let that happen.
so it sounds like Billy's always been cautious.
he's our oldest. And he follows the rules.
it drives his little sister crazy because she's the opposite.
and he rides his bike a lot?
all the time. Even at night?
he's got lights and reflectors.
he even has a head lamp on his helmet.
we used to ride with him, but he's 13.
he was only two streets over.
and you feel pretty certain that he wouldn't go anywhere with a stranger?
no. No way. Never.
if someone asked for help, would he stop?
hold on. Are you saying that Billy was taken because he's polite?
I'm not saying that it's his fault or yours.
Billy is a cautious child, and that will be his strength right now.
she left after seeing a photo of her father?
did she accuse him? No, the opposite. She protected him.
Garcia ran her mental health history. She had some grief counseling after her mother died, but other than that, no therapy.
we can talk to her, but we can't force her to help.
no, but something in her gut brought her in here.
if there's any truth to her instincts, there's gonna be some kind of a record of a missing boy from 30 years ago.
well, have Garcia check unsolved cases and also check into J. B. Allen's history.
we can't rule anybody out.
OK. How are Morgan and JJ doing with the boy?
he's so traumatized, he can't even speak.
give me everything you have on J. B. Allen also, all of the unsolved missings.
you know what? Go back to 1980 just to cover bases.
Thanks, Garcia.
it's ok. It's ok.
what did Garcia find out?
she broadened her search, but nothing that matches his description.
somebody's gotta be missing this kid.
no, hey, hey, no. No, no. That's not for us. That's not for us.
it's for the doctors outside. It's for the doctors, not for us.
it's all right.
it's ok. It's not for us.
there you go. Come on back. Here. Just take it.
there you go.
I, um, I got him to nod, but... not much more than that.
and you asked him his name? Yeah.
what about in Spanish?
it doesn't matter the language if he won't talk.
mi nombre es Jennifer.
?Como te llamas?
what's your name, sweetheart?
can I see what you have there?
do you like eagles?
Yeah, the wings are- are beautiful, aren't they?
your back? Wings?
wings on your back.
is your name Angel?
so, softball, basketball, and soccer. You played a lot of team sports.
was your dad a coach?
no. He was always too busy with work.
I guess that's why he kept me busy. It was ok, though.
the house was too quiet after mom died. She had cancer.
I didn't really know what that meant growing up, just that... she wasn't gonna get any better.
OK.
let's start with today. What brought you in here?
I saw that... that boy on the news.
and I saw, um... I can't really explain it.
I s- it was like a movie in fast-forward.
it was dark.
so dark.
and that- that little boy, he had the same chains on his ankles.
and then it was over.
those flashes that I saw.
that boy...
was he real? That's what we need to find out.
Thanks, JJ. Is the boy talking?
no, but they figured out that his name is Angel.
Garcia sent a list of all missing kids since 1980
with a concentration in southwest US. Most are runaways.
all right, let's eliminate the runaways and focus on lower-risk victims.
whoever's doing this likes the challenge.
here's the thing. This unsub is too controlled to let his victims escape.
I think Angel must have gotten away because he was being transferred somewhere.
I'm running out of options here.
the state troopers are eliminating roadblocks, and CARD is coming up empty.
if J. B. Allen is a suspect, why aren't we just kicking down his door?
because it's too risky.
if Allen is who we're looking for, he has a psychiatric disorder that drives everything he does.
he'll do whatever it takes to hide Billy, but he'll sacrifice him if it means protecting his own freedom.
everything that this unsub does is methodical.
he had a secure place to keep Angel for years, but when Angel escaped, he didn't mourn his loss. He drove straight to Flagstaff.
the questions is, why did he choose Flagstaff?
he'd only drive 60 miles out of his way if he knew someone was there to make him feel better.
we don't think that Billy was a victim of opportunity. We think he was the target.
so this isn't a stranger abduction. Chances are he'd seen Angel before, too.
the question is, where would he have access to both of these children?
who should we be looking at?
friends, neighbors, coaches, other parents.
we believe that this man has met Billy before.
what? You're saying this son of a bitch watched my son?
I'm say he talked to him long enough to earn his trust.
but the other little boy, the one that you just found,
I mean, why don't you ask him who's doing this?
he's not talking to us yet.
Oh, my God.
well, what happened to him?
Oh, my God!
that's right. That's right. Bring it over.
angel, that's pretty good, my man. You got it.
keep going.
OK, please tell me you found something.
I want to tell you that. JJ, there's not a single kid in the tri-state area who's gone missing whose name is Angel.
I did a nationwide search. Still zilch. Why wouldn't he be reported missing?
you tell me.
there's a lot of undocumented workers in Arizona.
Yes, I know. I've pulled harvest schedules already.
but what about school registrations?
there are more Angels than you think.
we think he's been held for a long time.
did any of them drop out during grade school? Go back to at least 2004.
second-grader Angel Suarez.
you got a picture? - Yes.
and if I run my simulation software to age him 8 years...
he'd be the boy that's in the room with you right now. It's him, JJ.
you are amazing. Thank you. Can you send
Yes. Send his mother's information to you right now.
you're the best. Bye. That sounded like good news.
I'm about to call Angel's mom. He's responding to Morgan.
it won't be long before he's talking.
OK, Angel, the Doc's here. You want me to stay?
all right, I'll be right outside.
OK.
Hey, Angel. You're doing great.
your mom will be so happy to see you.
OK.
it's ok. We can start again.
I'd like you to close your eyes. Please.
close your eyes.
concentrate on your breathing.
OK.
you said it was dark.
you were in your pajamas.
Yes. I was burning up.
you probably had a fever. What did you do?
I called out for my mom, but she wasn't strong enough, so I got into bed with her.
was your dad there? No.
did you hear anything?
my mom's breathing.
was she having trouble? Yes.
it's a strange sound.
was there another noise in the house?
there's something else, but I can't see anything.
I followed it. My feet are so cold.
because you were outside?
no. The basement.
I see him.
no, I was too scared.
no, no. I'd go back up to my parents' bedroom.
mommy. Mommy.
but I peeked out the window.
and there's the boy. What is he doing?
he's trying to get out of that truck. He's trying to get out of...
is your dad driving the truck?
no, no, no. He couldn't have done this.
you don't understand. He raised me in that house.
he couldn't have been doing that all these years.
No! - Ok. Ok.
J. B.'S friends with the whole town. Never remarried.
raised Sam by himself.
that's why this is so painful for her.
she doesn't want to believe that he's capable of it, but her memory's telling her differently.
so you believe her?
it's very hard to fake visceral reactions like that.
Yeah, but she's talking about a time of serious trauma, on a night she climbed into bed with her dying mother.
that plus her age, it's the perfect storm for a recovered memory.
wasn't that a huge therapy trend in the eighties?
a lot of women manufactured memories of their fathers doing horrific things.
and misguided therapists convinced them that their nightmares were real.
it was a huge waste of our resources.
I'm, uh, just not sure about this.
I think she's credible enough to warrant discreet rolling surveillance.
you'll have to use your own team, 'cause he'd recognize members of this force.
if he has Billy, he won't hesitate to get rid of him.
I'll get a CARD team member to join Reid.
allen can't know we suspect him.
you know, if J. B. Allen is our unsub, he certainly doesn't seem unhinged.
he went to the market today, and he stopped by his daughter's nursery, and right now I'm watching him landscaping.
at his house? Yeah.
is it isolated? Incredibly isolated. There's a lot of land.
you remember what Garcia sent us on J. B. Allen?
he started his contracting business in 1975, married Sam's mom that same year.
she died when Sam was 5, as we know.
he never remarried, and despite the newer subdivisions he built, he stayed in the house he shared with his wife.
so he's either sentimental, or he didn't sell because he's customized the house to hide his victims.
do you think Angel blames himself?
you know, seeing his mom for the first time may not go well.
well, right now it's just about the shame he's feeling.
she's gonna have to realize that he may not want to see her FOR A WHILE.
angel, no, no! Angel, no, no!
angel, stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
it's ok. JJ, get a towel. It's ok.
angel, listen to me. You're safe. You're safe. It's ok.
angel, you're safe. It's all right.
please. He's right there. I have to. I have to see him.
I thought he was gone all these years. My sweet boy.
don't you understand? I need to hold him.
OK. Listen.
angel hasn't been held in a very long time.
things happened to him.
he's going to have a hard time at first. Come on.
I know this isn't easy for you.
if I accuse him and he's done nothing...
then I've betrayed him.
but if he has, you'll save a young boy.
the best way for you to recover more of your memory is to return to the source of the initial sensory trigger. That was the basement.
how do I explain going down there?
did he have anything of yours down there?
Yeah. See if you can get it back.
help!
help!
please help me!
I have to help my boy. And you will.
but first, we need your help.
someone else's little boy is missing.
we're trying to find out how this man knew both your son and Billy, and to do that,
I need to know everything that happened the day Angel disappeared.
it was a Tuesday, after school.
the children were in the front yard.
it started raining, but Angel never came back in.
did you see anyone talking to them?
no. No cars. Nothing.
the neighbors- the neighbors helped me look.
I wanted to tell the authorities. I really did.
but-but we'd have to leave the country and I had to think of my entire family.
dios mio.
you just have to talk to him, Sam.
you can do this.
right.
dad?
you home?
back here!
the yard looks good. Oh, thanks.
the kids at the store said you were going to Phoenix, but I saw your truck down at the police station.
Oh, yeah. Their order for potted palms came in, so I just-I dropped it off at the station.
Mm. Chili. You want a bowl?
it smells great, Dad, but I can't stay.
since when? It's my chili.
he's not trying to get her out of there.
not yet. Hey, is my old catcher's mitt still down in the basement?
Yeah. Why?
I was thinking about coaching softball down at the Rec.
yeah? That's great.
you still got the homerun record, you know. Yeah, I know.
that practice paid off, huh?
is it, uh, it's still in the bin? Yeah. Let me get it.
no, no, no, that's ok. I got it.
uh-uh, I don't think so. I got boxes everywhere.
I've been trying to sort through some things.
I'm thinking of having a yard sale next week. You want in?
sounds good, but come on. I can get it.
suit yourself.
he let her go down there. Yeah, but he hesitated.
he's not acting like he's got something to hide, Emily.
that's how he's gotten away with it. We don't know that.
you find it?
cause it's right over here.
Thanks.
told you it was a mess down here.
Yeah. Yeah.
you sure you can't stay? Yeah. I'm not feeling great, and I gotta get up early tomorrow.
you going to Phoenix? Uh, pickups, deliveries. It'll be a long one.
OK, then. See you later, Peanut.
later, Dad.
I'm so sorry. It's ok. You did everything we asked.
there was nothing in the basement. I'm sorry.
now all we've got is the kid.
it's called a challenge coin, Angel.
legend says an American pilot in World War I was gunned down over Germany.
and he crawled, across no-man's-land into French territory.
he was desperate to survive.
and he should have been safe, except that the French thought he was a German.
and he was almost executed.
but he showed them a coin.
it had his squadron's insignia on it.
it was given to him by a fellow pilot so that they would never forget what they shared.
what happened to him?
a French soldier recognized the insignia.
and they set him free.
angel, the man who took you took another boy and we have to find him. Can you help us do that?
I want you to have this. It's kept me safe.
listen...
that's the name of the man who hurt me.
I was just a young boy like you, Angel.
and I thought about doing that very same thing to myself. I did.
because the shame was too much.
but instead, I kept the pain buried inside of me.
and it tore me apart.
but, Angel, I never let that son of a bitch beat me.
I never gave him that.
I want to make this man pay for what he's done to you.
but I need your help.
I promise you that whoever hurt you will not win.
you and me together can take away what he kept from you and what he values the most, and that's freedom.
angel, please.
will you help me do that?
Yes.
can you tell us if any of these men look familiar?
it was always too dark.
I'm so sorry.
how do you feel? Like I failed.
you didn't.
I failed him.
I actually thought he could have done all of this.
I think it took more than a buried memory to come in here.
there is something about your father's behavior, things he has said and done that have bothered you for a long time.
you buried those.
just like the memory.
look...
you lost your mother when you were very young.
it would have been too devastating to lose your father as well.
repressing those memories is a defense mechanism.
so, um
what else did I bury?
his mood swings, probably.
do you remember when he was happy one day, angry the next?
Yeah.
and when his moods were extreme, did he give you gifts?
how do you know that?
what did he give you?
a bike, once.
was that one that you had asked for? No.
it was a- it was a BMX.
any others?
my catcher's mitt from today.
what did he do?
you can tell me.
he used to...
he used to bite me.
he hasn't for a while.
but he did...
he did other things.
will you let the doctor take a look?
maybe we can match dental records.
OK.
what about a few years ago?
in 2004, did he give you anything?
that's the year he gave me Randy.
my-my dog. He was just a puppy then.
guys, Sam's father gave her gifts, trophies, from each abduction.
that's significant. I didn't know that's what they were.
we need to find out if Angel had a puppy the day he was taken.
a puppy? Yeah.
Ohh... That's right.
some of the neighbors were giving them away that day.
they had a whole box.
but I wouldn't let the boys keep one.
Hotch, you hear that? Yes. Thanks, JJ.
uh, wait, Hotch.
um... We're trying to get a dental match.
he's got oldbite marks.
what is it? Oh, my...
my dad has his teeth recapped a few years ago.
he said something like, that's what happens when you get older or whatever. He made a joke about it.
you better not give me any trouble.
No! No!
we're heading to Allen's house. You think he's got a secondary location?
he could, but guys like him keep their victims close.
we'll search every inch of the property.
keep us posted. - Will do.
JJ. What's going on?
they're going to find J. B. Allen.
angel said it was always dark. He must have had him underground somewhere.
it's a big property. Let's keep looking.
Oh, God.
it's clear.
his truck's still here. He may be, too.
he wouldn't risk it. He's gotta have another vehicle. I'll get the roadblocks back up.
any idea where he would go?
someplace that feels like home. Let's go.
you're on speaker, Garcia.
so I tracked J. B. Allen's property developments over the last 30 years. They're all over the map
well, of Arizona, anyway. Sending it to you now.
hope you can make more sense of it than I can. Thanks, Garcia.
the one thing that your memory and Angel's escape have in common is he was getting rid of both boys.
he would only do that if he had another boy waiting in the wings.
that means he met his victims before.
how? I mean, they're hours apart.
look at the towns. He had subdivisions in all of them.
construction sites are a magnet for 10- to 12-year-old boys.
he...
he gave kids a ride on the backhoe all the time.
they would just line up for it.
Oh, my God. I
I- I didn't know.
we found his target-rich environment. The construction sites?
Yeah.
see if Sam remembers a particular one that he took her to frequently.
just one place? He keeps his victims for years.
the burial sites would be someplace special, and he'd need a reason to revisit.
is there a favorite place your dad likes to go? You mean like the lake or something?
no. Most likely having to do with his work.
somewhere he's proud of? His first development.
where is that? In Mesa.
every few years he adds on to it.
he adds another house?
he says that it's the place that reminds him how he got started.
it set the foundation for everything. Did you hear that?
loud and clear.
please! Somebody!
help me!
help!
help!
No!
No! No
come on. It's ok.
you're all right. You're ok.
Morgan, that's enough! That's enough!
are you ready, Angel?
Yeah.
nino mio, mi nino. Mi nino.
mi nino.
do you always keep them with you? Yeah.
but the one I gave Angel was the only one that had wings on it.
you know Angel's never gonna let that go.
what you shared, I know that wasn't easy.
none of this is easy.
I can't help but picture little Morgan.
you were so alone.
I'm here right now because of what that man did to me.
I know.
I'm just... Sorry.

Oh, uh, so, remember, we have the play date with Cameron.
So...you're on your own for dinner. Oh, I'll manage somehow.
I love you, too. I love you.
I love you three. Jump! Come on.
Ohh! I love you four.
you have to go to your mama, ok? Ok.

Bye, daddy. All right. Kick it again.

I want to see it. It's so cool.
OK, ok, uh, the TV movie is in hall H at 9: 00.
can we go to that? - Absolutely.
you think we can we make it to the Captains of the Enterprise panel at 11: 00?
OBS. Thanks for coming with me. Of course. I've been knitting this scarf for weeks.
Penelope. Kevin. Hi.
you came. And you brought a friend.
CSU Technician Sharp, how are you? Fine. You?
I am also fine. Ok, well, see ya.
you're not gonna go in?
no. Actually, we just went in and it's super lame, so we're leaving.
Oh, ok. Oh, great costume.
Yeah, you, too. That was awkward.
Oh, my God. We used to come every year. I can't believe he brought someone else.
well, you brought someone else.
Yeah. Someone I couldn't possibly be sexually attracted to.
you're welcome? Whoa, Rossi!

no.

so, have fun.
it's my bedtime. It's 9 a. m.

thank you. Thanks.
I don't know. Emily, what's not to know?
it's a beautiful place.
there are cracks in the foundation.
cracks can be fixed. No, they can only be hidden.
they're still there. What, are you afraid the place is gonna fall down?
I'm afraid it's never gonna be as strong as it was.
OK, somebody's heart is not into it.

Yes. Did you remember your glasses?
Yes. Nag, nag, nag.

I only saw the King and the Jack, but I figure the Queen's inside, too.
the media's calling them the Face Cards. 7 bank robberies in 7 months.
they've killed one person at each robbery. M. O?
single gunshot wound. Each of the victims has bled out.
serial killers with a 30-day cooling-off period and we're only just hearing about this now?
well, headquarters has always characterized them robbers first and killers second.
no one kills 7 people without serious psychopathic tendencies.
I disagreed with the original assessment. I was overruled.
so why are we here now? Because crisis negotiation is overseas.
what more do we know about them?
they're organized, they're efficient. Each strike lasts about 2 minutes.
they gotta be scouting the banks in advance.
why haven't we been able to I. D. them off of surveillance footage?
they hack the security feed and turn off the cameras, both during the initial canvass and during the robbery, until the masks come back on, and then we're allowed to watch.
I can't find anything. No doors, no grates, nothing.
yo! Lynne! What's another way out of here?
just the main entrance and the side door. It's for security.
I know that. You think I'm stupid? What went wrong? We were on count.
I need a doctor. Is anyone a doctor?!
would you shut that kid up! He's a baby. What do you expect her to do?
it's ok, baby. It's ok.
no one asked for your opinion.
it's not just the cops. We've got the Feds now, too. We're screwed.
you have to apply pressure. I can't even feel it.
Yeah, I know. Just push down as hard as you can. Would you focus on what's important.
shut the hell up! He's bleeding out. It's his fault we're in this mess.
nice heads-up on the cops, Olly. Maybe think it was your count that was off, huh?
how bad is it? You're gonna be fine.
I don't want to die.
we're all gonna die if we don't get out of here. You shot a cop.
shut the hell up! You're not gonna die.
we're trapped in here, ok.
but we got one thing they want- all them.
they're using the hostages as human shields.
this is the first time they've been interrupted. What went wrong?
it's a big bank.
it's possible they weren't about to round everybody up before someone triggered an alarm.
why haven't they cut the feed now that they've been cornered?
letting us see inside gives up a tactical advantage. They gotta know that.
they don't seem to care. They're overconfident. Arrogant, even.
the face card masks add to their narcissism. Their personas are the royalty of poker.
JJ, Reid, and Prentiss, look at past robberies. That's gonna be our victimology.
pull another analyst if you need to. Dave, I want you to handle negotiations.
and, Morgan, strategize tactical options with MPD.
chief Strauss.
the Director ordered me to supervise your operation.
puts you right in the spotlight.
well, you've got gunmen with hostages in the Capital. The Hill's concerned.
we're about to open lines of communication. What about a tactical assault?
I don't think it's a good idea. There are hostages in front of the doors and windows.
what's your negotiation strategy? The Jack's bleeding out.
they'll ask for medical attention. The female unsub might have something to say about that.
look at her body language. Mm. She is cold and detached.
the King seems genuinely concerned about his partner's welfare.
but she couldn't give a damn. The men probably know each other.
Yes. Garcia? Shuffling my techno fabulous deck of databases, sir.
Hey, don't look. It's gonna be ok.
we're all gonna die, aren't we?
I'm sure the police will give them what they want.
stop talking!
it's gotta be the Feds.
I'll be right back.
who the hell's this? My name is David Rossi. I'm with the FBI.
to whom am I speaking?
all right, I want a doctor sent in, and then I want out of here.
well, we certainly can discuss that.
let the hostages go and we'll give you all the medical help you need.
I can't do that. I need the leverage.
how about a sign of good faith?
send out the women and children and I'll see what I can do.
he's trying to negotiate. Negotiate? We're not playing games.
no, no, no, please! Daddy!
either we get what we want or everyone in this room dies.
do that and you get nothing. Take me instead. Please.
take me.
it's ok, baby.
daddy!
you better send in some help or more people are gonna die.
we're sending in a medic. That's just gonna give them another hostage.
if they stop shooting people, it's worth it.
if we give in to one demand, we'll have to give in to them all. The Director disagrees.
at least make it an Agent with medical training.
that way he can take advantage of an opportunity if it comes.
fine.
the brass thinks they'll act rationally, but there's no evidence of that.
this is personal for the men.
the King could have run after the initial gunfight, but he didn't.
instead, he pulled the partner inside out of harm's way.
and stayed with him, while the woman searched the bank, presumably for a way out.
he's more worried about the partner than he is about her running away.
Garcia, narrow your search.
I think the male unsubs might even be related. Roger that.
in 6 robberies no one's been able to build a sketch of the unsubs before they put their masks on.
these witness descriptions are all over the map.
probably because of the trauma suffered inside.
they've been zig-zagging north and south but in a relative straight pattern from Washington, D. C.
this is the largest bank they've hit.
before today, it's just been small branches in rural communities.
so today was always a part of their plan.
but why the nation's capital? To make a statement?
I pulled schematics from the previous banks. This is the first one with metal detectors.
maybe that's what went wrong? No, they cased the branches too well in advance.
they'd know to be ready for them. These are takeover robberies.
no faces, no passing notes, no prints. They're professionals.
Hey, there is something all these robberies have in common.
the Queen's the only one who pulls the trigger.
sir, I found a thing. See, I took height and weight measurements and I crossed with known related offenders who specialize in bank jobs and home burglaries.
show me. - Yes.
these are brothers Chris and Oliver Stratton.
they are petty thieves from Philly, turned bank robbers in Jersey.
they were put in jail for two years after an attempted heist went sour, and they were released two months before the first face card robbery, and their measurements are a match.
when didn't the NCIC database connect them?
because the brothers have never used a third partner, and shooting people's not part of their M. O.
it looks like they weren't very successful criminals.
maybe adding a woman to their team improved their game.
the woman chose a different type of victim each time. It's not just the security guard.
it's been a mother, a manager, and a young child. She shoots them in the gut.
they bleed out while they rob the bank.
she's sadistic. She gets off on her victims' pain and the fear it incites in those around her.
move him out of here.
stay with me, Olly. Where's my medic?
I don't see him.
kill someone else, then. Make them listen.
it also appears the King is in charge of the money-grabbing operation while the Queen keeps track of time making sure they're in an out in under two minutes.
she's more in control of the operation than they let on.
turning the King and Queen against each other could be the key to disarming them.
he's not a killer. That could be our in.
only if the Jack doesn't die. If he does...
no, no, no. I want you to put that in your bag.
the woman's probably going to want to search you.
but Chris is gonna be too focused on getting aid to his brother to delay long enough for her to check the bag, too.
all right. You're going in to provide medical assistance.
no unnecessary risks, you hear me?
once you stabilize Oliver, check on the hostage they just shot.
understood. He might still be alive.
do not draw your weapon unless you can subdue the unsubs without endangering the hostages.
Yes, sir.
why hasn't anyone come in yet?
we're sending in the medic now, Chris. Tell Oliver help is on the way.
hurry. They know our names.
not all our names.
is she putting on lipstick?
they're sending someone in.
Chris. Olly, Olly, no.
no, no, no, stay with me. What are you doing?
they're sending in a medic. You're gonna be fine.
I don't feel so fine.
No! No! No!
get over here!
you're gonna save him, right? I'm gonna try.
Oliver, can you hear me?
come on, Olly. Stay with me, Oliver.
this is not good, Aaron. Morgan, tell Green to make a move before Chris does.
green, you gotta go. Green, go.
Oh, my God.
tactical's been deployed, snipers are moving into position.
the Director's ordered a full tactical assault.
his last orders cost us an agent. SWAT's getting itchy fingers.
you remind SWAT that bank robberies are federal jurisdiction.
no one fires until they're ordered to. Right.
all right, when the crossfire starts, what's gonna happen to the hostages caught in the middle?
that's the wrong call, Erin, and you know it. It's not my call.
you're here and you're in charge. So you want me to disobey the Director?
Yes.
no, I just want you to buy us a little time. Don't be quite so efficient.
whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.
all right. Reasoning with them is still our best option.
that'll be difficult. Chris just lost his brother and murdered someone in retaliation.
we're dealing with two killers now. We have problems, sirs.
outside nefarious sources have hacked into the surveillance feeds.
I'm trying to I. D. them now. At least a couple of them are media outlets.
can you block them? No, not without blocking ourselves, too, sir.
put him with the others.
Hey! Everybody move forward 5 feet. Come on! Move forward 5 feet!
line up!
I'm sorry about Olly. Just shut up, would you.
we've got to pull ourselves together, figure a way out of here.
what happened?
who triggered the alarm?
was it you? Calm down. We need to focus.
call them back. Demand an armored truck.
what, you think they're gonna let us go?
we killed 4 people. Two cops.
so what? We don't try? That's just great.
why don't you walk over there. I gotta think for a minute.
whatever you say...
boss.
why'd you have to make it so quick?
it's better when they suffer.
I don't get off on it like you do. You will.
look. We're gonna be famous.
agent Prentiss, there's a call for you from Interpol. Take a message, please.
it's Clyde Easter. Your old unit chief?
he says he has information about the Queen of Diamonds.
two suspects identified.
sorry I missed your funeral, by the way. I was held up in Prague.
so you're not surprised. Of course not.
keeping tabs on my former assets is a particular skill of mine.
OK, what can you tell me about my mystery woman?
Yes. Well, um, if she seems familiar to you, she should.
we don't know her identity, but we've seen her before.
she's struck a number of banks worldwide, including
Paris! There was a robbery when I was relocated there.
someone died. Oh, yes. The bank manager, Glenn Harrison.
gut shot? Yes. How did you know?
I don't remember hearing anything about the robber wearing a mask.
that's because she didn't. She seems to be wearing disguises.
her faces has been seen on camera by 6 different intelligence agencies and no one can identify her.
how is that possible? Wait, who were her partners overseas?
she didn't need any. Then why would she now?
what if the smaller banks were training runs from the Stratton brothers?
well, it could be. She took two relatively amateur thugs and turned them into an elite team of efficient bank robbers.
but why? To turn them into patsies? All right, ok, so let's look at it.
up until now they've been highly organized, striking only on deposit days, when the most amount of cash is on hand.
but today's different. It's their first Saturday hit, where families are present, more foot traffic throughout the day.
it's a riskier attack. We should consider the media attention, too.
it's the first time they've had an audience. That might be why the female unsub is so vain.
she wants to look good for the cameras.
she searches the bank but doesn't actually look for a means of escape.
she appears to be almost enjoying the situation.
we know the brothers are in it for the money. What's she in it for?
where the hell have you been? I've been looking for an escape route.
there isn't one.
so much for your no back doors, no surprises plan. You screwed us.
then why don't you negotiate a way out of here already?
what? How do you want to end this, Chris?
I want out of here. How do you propose to do that?
I want an armored truck and a plane with a clear flight path to Switzerland.
no, no, no. Chad. We want to go to Chad.
Yeah. No agents with guns this time. We'll fly ourselves.
don't do that again. I'm in charge here.
OK, so what's the significance of Chad?
a 2008 coup attempt plunged them into political instability.
they're currently in the middle of a civil war.
there's gotta be more to it than that. Our ghost wants to go to Chad.
I'm figuring you're my best chance of finding out why.
Chad? That's an odd choice.
they're not exactly hospitable this time of year.
they said they could fly themselves there.
nothing suggests that Chris would have that ability, so she must.
well, unfortunately, Interpol doesn't have many assets in that particular region in Africa.
maybe that's something that you could help me with when this is over.
work for Interpol again? That'll be the day.
not work, darling. Run.
you see, I've been promoted.
so, the team's yours whenever you want it. It's a hell of a time to bring that up.
well, you know, in our line of work, there's never a good time.
think about it. Please?
you find me a connection I can use and maybe we'll discuss it.
the FBI's making good on its promise. We'll be out of here soon.
we're taking him with us.
these guys were too good to get caught, so why did they?
911 received a call alerting them to a robbery in progress.
actually, it was a text.
D. C. add 911 messaging after the Virginia Tech students texts went unanswered during the massacre.
can you trace it, Garcia?
Yeah. The message was sent from a cell phone that is currently inside the bank and was registered to a Larry Phillips Jr.
why does that name sound familiar?
that's the name of one of the gunmen from the '97 North Hollywood bank shootout in California.
so is this an homage?
guys, that text was sent 30 seconds before they blacked out the security feeds for entry.
how is that possible?
it didn't come from a hostage. It came from one of the robbers.
she wanted us here.
there's no clear line of sight to the vault.
no, but if we come in, that's where they'll go. We need to be ready for it.
Garcia caught us up. Why instigate a hostage situation?
what's a narcissist without attention? She thrives on it.
she must have something bigger in mind.
we need to separate Chris and the female to find out what that is.
it's not going to be hard. They're already on edge.
it's more than the media outlets, sir.
anonymous international entities are hacking the feeds as well.
headquarters
you were saying?
I was tagging I. P. addresses and someone hacked the surveillance cameras at 7 a. m. this morning.
was that how they shut down the cameras for entry?
no, sir. This is an entirely different hack, one that's still receiving.
somebody else is watching. Who?
whoever it is she's dressing up for. I thought that was for the media.
the media didn't have eyes inside before today. But she dresses up every time.
because someone is always watching. Her real partner, a fourth unsub.
I doubt if she was forthcoming about this other partner to Chris.
I think it's time we bring Chris up to speed.
you know my favorite card in poker, Chris? What's that?
the wild card. I don't believe in wild cards.
they dumb down the game.
well, I couldn't agree with you more, but, uh, in this case, you're the one that's dumb.
this your new negotiation tactic, insulting me? Oh, it's not a tactic.
it's a fact.
didn't you wonder why you got caught, what went wrong when you did everything right?
we got a message from someone in the bank before you started shooting.
impossible.
now, I know it wasn't you, and I'm hoping it wasn't your brother.
so, who does that leave? You're lying.
ask her. Did you call the police?
is that what they're telling you? That's not an answer.
of course not. What do you think? They're trying to turn us against one another.
why would you even do that? Olly's dead 'cause of that.
I wouldn't. I'm trapped here, too.
are you lying to me? We've come to far for you to start doubting me now.
lost too much. Hey.
hey...
don't let them tear us apart right as we're about to win.
if you do that, Olly's death won't mean anything.
enough. I'm done talking to you.
I want to talk to someone who won't jerk me around face to face.
no more Feds. I want to talk to the cop who shot my brother.
no. No, forget it.
JJ, if it means we can end this...
what makes you think he won't shoot you the minute you walk inside?
look, he wants out of there just as much as we want him out.
it's not happening. Forget it.
there's no guarantee he won't retaliate for the death of his brother.
I know you'd do it if you were me.
will, I get what you're feeling, but you are too close to this case to make that call.
you're damn right I'm close. 4 people are dead because I shot his brother.
and no one else needs to die 'cause of what I did.
this isn't about you. Risking your life won't bring them back.
sorry, Will.
Where's that cop, huh? I ain't got all day.
what you're asking is difficult. Well, I'll make it easy.
send in the cop, I'll let a couple hostages go.
a sign of good faith. Isn't that what you said?
releasing the hostages is a great first step in resolving this conflict, but we can't send someone else in to be killed.
this ain't a friggin' debate.
come on, bud. Let's go!
pick up the phone. Why?
pick up the phone!
Hello? Tell him your name.
it's... It's Shawn Harper.
you just killed Shawn Harper. Not me, you.
I'm gonna shoot another hostage every 60 seconds until you send in the cop.
every 60 seconds.
who's next? Huh?
he's threatening to shoot more hostages unless he has Will. Screw this. I'm going in.
no, you're not. We are.
who's the lucky one?
Nah. Nah. Nah. Nah. Nah.
you!
No!
no.
pick it up.
come on.
what's your name? No, please.
tell him your name! Annie.
it's Annie. You hang in there, Annie. Help is on the way.
you got about 30 seconds, Annie. I hope Agent Rossi doesn't make me shoot you, too.
you ok? Yes.
Hey, you. Come over here.
it's ok. No, I...
just let the women and children go. They don't need to see this.
pretty soon they're gonna be doing a lot more than just seeing.
Annie! You just got yourself a reprieve.
get in line over there.
look at our new contender. Let's go!
go, go, go! ????
what is he doing? No. No, no, no.
no, no. Morgan- Let me go, please!
I can't do that. Will! Will! Will!
Will...stop.
my name is Matthew Downs. Look.
let those people go.
all right, you, you, you. The kids. Get out.
got 3 coming out. Hold your fire.
thank you.
Hey. What's your name?
william LA Montagne Jr.
MPD.
did you see where he was shot?
is he alive or dead, Garcia? I don't know.
he was wearing a vest. He might be ok.
might be.
they're not answering. All right, we need to get inside.
JJ, it's too risky. We don't have eyes in there anymore.
let's go in.
hold your hands right there.
what are you doing?
a dead cop isn't going to be much of a negotiation tool.
boss, are you good with this?
what? Yeah, fine.
you ok?
I shouldn't have done that. They're never gonna let us out of here now.
who knows? Maybe they'll save him and he'll be our ticket out of here.
you took my advice. How's that?
you didn't go for the kill shot.
right.
I need to check the back again. There's gotta be an escape we haven't thought of.
OK.
his blood pressure's dropping.
hold that. Are you holding it as tight as you can? Yeah.
how's JJ? It's bad, Reid.
I should be there. We've learned everything we can from here.
no, you can help more by helping me. There's a lot to got over and your brain works faster than mine.
seeing what's going on outside doesn't help us inside.
Kevin, can you possibly pull up each of the surveillance feeds prior to Will being shot?
sure. What are we looking for? The female unsub disappeared once before.
if she was looking for an escape, what was she doing?
I'm sorry.
keep the pressure. Keep the pressure. The pain won't kill him, but the loss of blood could.
just hang in there, buddy.
are you armed? No.
damn. I think we might have something of a chance here.
what? The girl's gone, and the guy's off his head.
he doesn't know who to trust. We can work them against each other.
wait, are you a cop? A former marine.
you gotta listen to me. I need you to get a message to my girlfriend.
all right, you can tell her yourself when we get you out of here. Only I'm not getting out.
you need someone to cause a distraction.
her name is Jennifer, and she's a federal agent.
you tell her I'm sorry. Sorry?
don't you want to tell her you love her or something?
she already knows that.
the woman.
what happened to her? Aren't you dead yet?
you can't trust her. She's taking orders from someone else.
no, she takes orders from me. Look around.
any second agents are gonna storm into this place, and the only bad guy I see is you.
she's setting you up to take the fall for this, boy.
that's not true. Then where is she?
she's back there.
all right. You. Come here.
I'll show you. Go on.
come on!
where are they going? He's giving us our chance.
we've got movement. Somebody's coming out. Be ready.
it's hostages. Copy. Standing by for entry.
what the hell are you doing down here? Calm down. You'll find out soon.
tell me.
we're going in.
she was following the electrical lines... gas mains. Oh, no.
Garcia, get them out of there!
abort! Abort!
JJ, are you all right?
are you ok? Where's Will?
where is Will? Did he get out of there?
Where's Emily?
here I come! Police!
there's been an explosion at Colonial Liberty Bank in the judicial district.
authorities right now at the scene say they don't yet have a casualty...
I can't get through. Even the SAT phone's got a busy signal.
what do we do? What are we supposed to do? I'm gonna get over there.
again, breaking news-- an explosion at Colonial Liberty Bank, killing a possible 24 hostages and an unknown number of law enforcement agents.
what is going on here? You didn't profile this as a suicide mission.
because it wasn't. They'd never kill themselves. What the hell do you call that, then?
they didn't improvise a way out. They've had an exit strategy in place.
you don't learn explosives overnight. We're looking for signatures on the bombs.
I need every fragment of every device that you can find, no matter how small or destroyed it looks.
I also need eyes on every angle in, out, and around the bank.
you have photos of the suspects.
we're going to continue to cross-check those against international connections.
do you have a positive I. D. on the woman yet?
no. Not yet. We need more agents.
Where's Homeland Security? They just got here.
sir, I've see Morgan and JJ, but I haven't seen Emily.
Emily? Over here!
you all right? Yeah. They were hiding back here.
can we move them? Yeah, with help. He's unconscious.
just let me stay with him.
please.
I can't find Will. Have you seen him? He might be down below.
we're gonna get you out of here.
he's my love of 66 years.
my story.
Yeah. No, it's bad, but I'm all right.
Yeah, just don't come into the city.
and can you take Jack on the bike ride today?
right. And can you put him on?
Hey, buddy, listen, um, I gotta work, so Beth's gonna take you on the bike ride, ok?
all right, I'll see you later. Can you keep the media busy?
is that all? - For now.
Yeah. You? You all right.
do me a favor. Have that ear looked at.
if this one's parallel to some Metro tunnel, there's a good chance it branches off.
all right, then we split up. Unless it's a trick.
well, then we're screwed.
is this the work of a terrorist cell?
we do not believe that they are part of any terrorist cells.
the bank heists point to them being independent anarchists with homicidal tendencies.
do you consider them serial killers? What was that?
are they serial killers? Yes. Without a doubt, the suspects are serial killers.
as Agent Hotchner told you, they want you to admire them.
leaving the cameras on was their way to brag about how much fear they were creating.
we need to know what happened, specifically the unsubs' behavior in the minutes leading up to the blast.
you'll be interviewing the survivors. They'll be in various stages of shock, but any information you might get could be the key to apprehending these suspects.
agent Hotchner has compiled a series of questions for you to ask them.
these questions are on your phones now.
thank you.
you're all right.
what are you doing here? It isn't safe.
I didn't want you to be alone.
I'm not. You know, they separate the President and the Vice President at times like this.
What...are you comparing us to POTUS?
I'm saying that you should be at Quantico running point. Well, I'm here right now.
what can I do? Ok. I need to analyze every frame of this video.
morgan and JJ said that the blast created a hole between the underground vaults and these tunnels.
you know, most of these older banks are made of granite or limestone for longevity.
so she knew to use a combination of C-4 and semtex to open her escape route.
the tunnels let out at multiple points running west. She could still be underground.
I know. This is what she does. She probably waited till the last minute to exit.
she wants to see all this chaos. We need to find the tunnel exit closest to the bank.
looks like it's two blocks here, just outside the perimeter.
what you got? Will always say, if you can, you leave a bread crumb.
OK, so he was here, and clearheaded enough to leave us a clue.
they shot him, Morgan. Why would they take him?
JJ, I don't know, but we didn't see any blood down there and he's not here. Both are good signs.
Yeah, but they have him, God only knows where or why. How's not good?
what the hell is that? You recording it?
I'm talking to you, Izzy!
you planned this whole thing. You didn't tell us any of it.
you set us up. You killed my brother. No, that would be him.
how do I know he isn't your partner?
why would I work with this guy? Why would you do any of this?
FBI said you got somebody else.
you sound jealous. Who is it?
put that away. This isn't about revenge, it's about survival.
if you haven't figured it out by now, I'm your only way out of this mess.
all right. Let me kill him so we can get on with it.
we need him. For what?
leverage. We have to patch him up. What, are you gonna walk him into an E. R?
JJ and Morgan said the unsubs were in an alley northwest of the perimeter.
Yeah, this footage confirms it. Ok, I can see two figures in the car.
please tell me one of them is Will. See how she's turned.
it's like she's keeping an eye on someone in the back. Does this mean Will's in the car?
there's somebody back there. What's the license plate?
that's weird. They're government tags.
federal. - Federal or district?
well, they're either stolen or forged. Who the hell are these people?
they set up roadblocks in the district from 66 to Dulles.
wait. So we're looking for a black SUV with its sirens on.
that's gonna stand out.
will's with them. I found his wallet.
it benefits them to keep Will alive. They must have a safe house set up.
whoever their outside man is, that's where they're heading now.
but where? What's their end game?
there's no logical reason. They want to create panic.
she's struck all over the world, which says she might not be American, but her ideology certainly speaks to Washington.
whatever point she and her partner are making, it's important that D. C.'s the setting.
the brothers were from Philadelphia. The other partner might be homegrown as well.
homeland's sending over a list of possibilities. They're not on anyone's list.
then how do we find them?
we find the common denominators between all 14 robberies and we go from there.
so she's our only answer. For now.
I'll call Easter at Interpol again.
now that there's been an explosion, he might have some ideas.
I'm so sorry about what happened. Is your team all right?
no. One of our own was taken hostage during the escape.
they made it out of that? Yeah. In a stolen government vehicle.
we've seen that before. Remember Scotland Yard '04?
a sedan was stolen from the impound lot.
Yeah, uh, security footage verified it was a woman, even though she was never caught.
no, but they found the car.
she left behind some fake I. D.s and weapons, and that's where she got her moniker, Lady X.
right. Everybody figured with that arsenal and her ability to evade, she was trained, probably an assassin.
two days later an ambassador was killed.
shot in the stomach. The question is, what assassin doesn't go for the kill shot?
this one. She's sadistic. Yeah. Fits your profile, I take it.
well, yeah, it's gotta be the same woman. She killed at each robbery.
the banks were simply a means to fund today's explosion.
even if she wears wigs, she doesn't mind showing her face, because she knows we won't find it.
we've only got one other thing to go on-- what she left behind.
what about Chad? Is there any connection? No, no, nothing yet.
but, um, if I had more help, say, running the London Gateway office, you'd have your answer much quicker. Yes, you should fix that.
well, I'm trying. You have always had bad timing.
Oh, come on, Emily. Don't you miss this?
think about it.
Yeah, I will.
all right. Yeah, I got it.
that was the lab. Semtex and C-4 like we thought.
red, blue, and yellow wires in each, old cell phone used as a detonator.
how old is the phone? - 10 years.
that's specific and rare. Ridiculously.
well, has anyone seen it before?
it was last seen in a number of bombings in Chad.
for a signature that specific, they must have been there to learn it.
did Easter have any insight?
a woman they called Lady X stole a sedan from Scotland Yard 8 years ago.
the investigation concluded she was a trained assassin. She disappeared.
so Lady X and Queen of Diamonds is the same person? It sounds like it.
Garcia, look at assassination attempts around the civil unrest in Chad.
if she was a hired gun, she was likely taking orders from someone.
maybe she's still working for the same guy now and he's still pulling the strings.
or maybe she's found her equal.
their obsession with killing and domination has culminated in what we've seen today.
getting off on the disaster they've created. Classic symphorphiliacs.
then this isn't over. Far from it.
no. Now that they've gotten away with this, where are they gonna strike next?
district OF COLUMBIA
morning.
yeah? - We need help.
Oh, is that a gunshot? - Obviously.
he's gonna need fluids. There's a hospital 3 blocks from here.
there's no time. Fix him.
will's definitely with them, and it looks like he can move without a problem.
cameras caught everything? Yeah. The woman killed the medic.
Hey, at least Will's ok. Yeah, for now.
did they leave in the same vehicle? Yeah, but it's been an hour since the explosion.
why haven't they left the city? The next attack could be here.
Kevin, what have you got? Just going through...
they did that on purpose, right? And you saw everything until they had Will.
well, they made a mistake.
leaving the cameras on gave us much more information than they realized.
what time did the 911 text come in? 9: 23.
the bank opened at 9: 00. Let's go back to the beginning. I need you both on this.
Yes, sir.
he said he'd call by now.
Hey. Yeah.
got it.
that was fast. Change in location.
get back on Pennsylvania Av.
I'm not going anywhere till you tell me the plan.
what are you doing? He talks too much.
go ahead, officer, get him out. And do what, just leave him here?
Yes, please.
sorry for the mess.
go ahead. Drive.
the explosion was a distraction so they could escape. Watch.
allow me to fast-forward.
all right, here's where Chris started shooting hostages.
the fella next to him didn't even flinch. Doesn't even break a sweat.
we know he's ex-military, but still... His name is Matthew Downs.
that's what he told Rossi and he wasn't lying.
history shows dishonorable discharge from USMC in '04.
Hi, Will. You see that?
I want to do it again. We will.
drive. You know the way.
drive.
OK, do me a favor. Keep going.
to where Will walks in.
OK, now watch him.
and then... look at her.
her partner was in there the whole time, just not in the way that we thought.
they shot this whole thing like a home movie. He could have been killed.
no, she wouldn't let that happen. What the hell are they doing?
it's all part of their plan.
they've created scenarios that are practically impossible to survive.
when they make it, it's the ultimate high. Like an adrenaline junkie.
nobody can find Matthew Downs. ERT said that he helped them, then he disappeared.
see you later? You better.
come on, officer. He's a detective.
I'm sorry, dick.
you better play nice, just like we talked about.
close the gate. Daddy.
Hey, pal. Hey, Will.
how are you? Thanks for taking care of the little man.
let me put you down while I talk to miss Kate. Ok, daddy.
you haven't been watching the news?
I heard about what happened, but no, I didn't want the kids to see it.
you guys working the case? In shifts, yeah.
OK, well, if you need Henry to stay, it's no problem. Well, uh...
I'm Izzy, Will's cousin. Oh, hi. I'm Kate. Nice to meet you.
she just--she just flew in. She's gonna take care of him, so it's all good.
all right, well, if you need anything, let me know. Ok. Sure thing.
Hey, Will. Get some sleep. You look like hell.
he's still in diapers? I don't really do those.
you touch my kid, I swear to God I'll kill you.
I already told you, you touch me, he kills her, then you.
do you really want to do that to your kid, be the reason he's an orphan?
daddy, let's play.
daddy can't play right now. I gotta go to work.
but this is, uh...
can you say hi to Izzy? Hi, Izzy.
she's gonna stay with you till mama comes home, ok?
OK. Hey.
I love you.
I love you.
come here.
it's gonna be ok. It's gonna be ok.
all right. I love you. Go play back there.
of course Will thought Matthew was a hostage. Why wouldn't he?
there's a good chance Will tried to help him out.
he told him when to go for the doors or offered to be a hostage to save the others.
I'm sure he did. Well, there's a flip side to this.
this guy could have gotten into Will's head.
is there anything you want to tell your family in case you don't make it?
you think Will told them about JJ and Henry? Unknowingly.
what's wrong? Will's license is gone.
they know where we live.
Hey, check it out, Will. Mine looks...
it looks almost as good as yours, huh?
I wasn't sure if I was gonna need you at all, but this way, it's more fun.
what do you want? Well, it's simple.
you do everything I tell you or Izzy kills your boy.
there is no way out. Let's don't believe the hype you're the hero.
today's not the day for that, Will. Come on, we're late.
don't do that. What?
go all quiet. What am I supposed to do?
yell.
I can't. You can't blame yourself.
want to bet?
I should have never left Henry today. You were doing your job.
I'm a mom. And a federal agent.
I'm a mom first.
who had no possible way of knowing how this thing would go.
we made this deal, Will and I.
that Henry would never be alone without either of us.
I broke that.
he'll forgive you.
why are you doing this?
why am I doing this?
you ever been in combat? No.
soldiers don't come back and kill innocent people.
you were sick before you ever went to war. You've never been.
it wasn't the same after.
they just cut you off, you know?
everyone. Your family. The Corps. The country.
goodbye. We used you.
it's a betrayal. So what did I do?
I found a new home.
detective. You on lockdown?
no. We're diverting all traffic. Official vehicles only.
we're just here to do a sweep.
Yes, sir. Go on through.
I thirsty.
you need to draw it.
you're silly.
can we play hide-and-seek? In a minute.
come here.
my grandfather's name was Henry.
he had blond hair just like you. He was a scary man.
Why?
let me tell you a story.
so why didn't they take all the money?
they were a man down and they had to get out in a hurry.
but for her, today was less about the money and more about the spectacle.
everything they've said and done was for a reason.
but what doesn't make any sense is she switched the negotiation demand.
Chris wanted to go to Switzerland. She changed it to Chad.
they also requested a private plane, but no mention of a pilot.
guys, if you think about it, even the dates mean something.
in 2004, while she was wreaking havoc abroad, he was dishonorably discharged.
then in 2008, they likely met in Chad. And now this in 2012.
OK, so is it a coincidence that those are all election years and they attacked D. C?
maybe this is a political statement.
no. It's more personal than that.
it's their story. What?
all of the details are a part of their story.
their timeline suggests they were both destructive before they met.
so we're talking about ex-military turning on their country.
it's rare, but soldiers become disenfranchised no matter what the nationality.
and if he met someone like-minded at that time, there'd be no stopping them.
so you're thinking they met during the civil unrest in Chad in '08.
Yeah, and one or both of them are pilots.
so if Garcia concentrates on that region, specifically weapons running in and out of Libya, there's a good chance we'll find their paths crossed.
OK, multiple entries into Libya for a private pilot named Matthew Downs in '08, but I don't have her name. Well, because she had aliases.
it's the only way to stay a ghost. Here's the thing- they are a couple.
regardless of what we believe of them, they will celebrate themselves and their connection.
is there anything that happened on this date in Chad?
Oh, you are good, Emily Prentiss. But this news is not.
Yes, there were multiple explosions on this date in '08.
where were the most casualties? At a church-- no, no, a train.
Yep. Morgan; Semtex and C-4? Are trains still arriving at Union Station?
she doesn't have her cell. Kate would never take her eyes off Henry like this.
they must have him. Wait.
we need a distraction.
I thought you cared more about your family, Will.
he's gonna want to stay close to watch.
please proceed with caution to the nearest exit.
thank you.
MEEZZANINE CLOSED FOR RENOVATION PARDON OUR DUST
Hotch, I got the suspect going out the east wing.
copy.
I found Will. Is he mobile?
negative. He's got 6 transmitters on him and this whole place is gonna blow.
all right, where are you? I'm on my way.
no, you gotta get everyone out. Is the bomb squad here yet?
they're 3 minutes away. Copy.
Emily, you gotta get Henry. They're at the house.
turn around.
mommy!
come here. Mommy.
just get everybody out of here.
I'm not gonna leave you. Just give me a minute.
just about all you got. Ok, everything they did and said was about them.
narcissists. Romantics.
they met in 2008.
Oh, what are you doing?
seriously, Emily, go.
go.
OK, hold on. Chad.
2-4-2-3.
Oh! Damn it.
OK, these are valentines for her, so a 4-letter word. Love, life, soul.
Izzy. Her name is Izzy.
Oh, God!
Prentiss, what's your status?
Prentiss, do you copy? The storytelling's in the details.
those wires mean something. Like what?
the colors of the flag of Chad. Red, yellow, and blue.
only one is different from the U. S. flag--yellow. What do you think?
how did you do that? I didn't overthink it.
they say I need another X-ray.
Hey, come on.
no tears. It's ok.
Henry's safe. It's all gonna be fine.
ask me again. What?
ask me.
Jennifer Jareau, will you marry me?
Yeah.
Oh, it's about damn time.
there's a chaplain here. Let's just do it now. Let's just get it over with.
hell, no. I'm not the one that's supposed to be in the gown.
all right, fine. Monday, then.
clear your calendar, 'cause we have a date at the courthouse.
the convention's still happening tomorrow if you want to go.
that whole city on the brink of destruction thing kind of took the wind out of my sails, you know?
that'll do it every time. We didn't finish the inspection.
no need. What happened?
there is a horizontal crack in the foundation.
it just weakens the entire base that the house is sitting on. Yeah. That does not sound good.
so, our unsub is Izzy Rogers.
she'll be charged with multiple counts domestically, and our international counterparts will have their turn with her.
she will never see the light of day. I just thought you'd like to know that.
agent Morgan, a word?
I, uh...
I haven't had a chance to speak with you.
I sort of hit the ground running.
it took a lot of courage to confront me about my drinking.
you changed my life. Thank you.
honestly, ma'am, that's not necessary. A simple "you're welcome" would suffice.
I'm just glad you're back.
no, you're not. Hang on, let me check.
Oh, wait, she's here. Erin, don't go anywhere.
Dave wants to know if everyone is free tomorrow night?
well, it depends on if he's buying. Then I'm definitely in.
Yeah, me, too.
you hear that? We're in.
Emily, look, I know you don't want to talk about it, but it's exactly why we need to talk about it.
this has nothing to do with cracks in the foundation.
no. But it's a sign.
Oh, please don't get all free spirit on me.
I almost blew up yesterday, twice. I know.
that's about as grounded as you can get.
you want to leave, don't you?
I didn't say that.
it's the only reason you would be this quiet, Emily. Can we please talk about this later?
no.
how long have you been thinking about this?
honestly... Since I got back.
Really? It's not you guys.
I love you.
I just can't grab on to my old life and pretend that nothing happened.
is this about Easter? No.
but he did ask me to run the London office.
and you're gonna do it. He just asked yesterday.
but you're thinking about it.
I don't know yet. I
I thought buying a house and putting down roots was gonna fix this feeling, it was gonna give me what I wanted.
but it hasn't.
it's bigger than that.
you think I should stay.
I think I miss you already.
what?
Uh-uh- I'll tell you later.
I do not like the sound of "I'll tell you later."
it's JJ's night, and I don't want to...
all right, if you are telling me that there is something bad happening right now to balance out the goodness that is tonight,
I will have none of it, because I don't believe in that.
although it's totally one of the truths of life.
isn't it? The bitter and the sweet mixed up together in a cosmic soup that we've all signed up for.
breathe. Breathe. I think Kevin's here tonight.
it would make sense that he would come tonight.
he's here. He's here and he's with her, so I'm gonna go somewhere which is not go somewhere that is not-- that is not here.
hello. Hello. Hi. Hi, Penelope.
Hi. Hello.
Hello, Emily.
Hi. It's nice to see you again. Oh, it's nice to see you, too. Hey, Derek.
Hey, Beth. What's up, Hotch?
Oh, look out. Look who it is.
little man Jack. Give me some. Hey, guess what.
they got a really cool fountain right over there. You want to check it out with me?
sure. I want to see, too.
all right, come. Go. Go, go, go, go. How are you?
that bad? What?
that's your tell. It is?
for how long? Uh, ever since I've known you.
well, you have one, too. I do?
Yeah. Only I'm not gonna tell you what it is - Or you'll stop doing it.- I see.
do you want to talk about it?
Absolutely.
but not now. First thing tomorrow.
it's a date. Ok.
Hey.
someone knows how to throw a party.
you don't mess around.
what can I tell you? I'm the host with the most.
no kidding. Hey, look who's here.
mom...
OK, what's--what's going on?
well, we couldn't get married without your mama.
I might have overheard a little proposal yesterday.
and I couldn't wait till Monday.
OK, so this is why you guys are so dressed up, huh?
Yes. And you will be, too. I brought something borrowed.
mom, is that your dress? Yes.
let's go see if it still fits.
OK.
mom...
so, nervous?
only if she doesn't come back down.
they s that good things happen to good people.
today is one of those days, and these are two of those people.
we love you.
Cheers. Cheers.
Cheers.
I've always heard every ending is also a beginning and we just don't know it at the time.
I'd like to believe that's true.
San Diego, CA
you gotta be kidding me. I can't take you.
well, how many times have I taken you to the airport?
Matt has a soccer game tomorrow. I have a report I have to finish.
it'll only take an hour.
fine. I'll call a cab.
Oh, come on, Kyle.
+1 555-0186 Can't wait to see you.
be there soon.
Kyle, I'm running out!
come on, Rossi. - I don't want to use them.
I don't even understand you. It's a vacation, Rossi. Everyone likes vacation.
vacations are overrated. - Didn't you take a vacation two years ago?
luckily, two days in I was called back.
Yeah, and now he's got 31 days. - A month?
you know, sunshine is an essential source of vitamin D. You should go to Florida and get some sunshine.
that's for old guys.
what about a safari in Africa? - Too hot.
how about Italy? - Too many relatives.
you sound hermetic.
no, Rossi just likes his wine and stogies.
and I go crazy if I have nothing to do.
you know, Rossi, if you don't use 'em, you lose 'em. - Thank you. This is what I've been telling him.
see this? This is my "I don't care" face.
that's your normal face.
if I were you, I'd give your vacation days away to a colleague in need.
Garcia, see how many people in the Bureau have spouses in the military serving overseas.
I am on it. Altruism is sexy.
Yes, it is.
let's get started. - Yes, sir.
all right, crime-fighters, last night, two victims,
Brenda Wipley and Mark Coleman were found murdered hours apart, one in San Diego, one in Los Angeles.
they were blitz-attacked and they were chained to a car where they were dragged alive to their deaths.
and the local P. D. does not believe the victims knew each other.
and both received similar text messages last night from prepaid phones asking them to meet.
so our unsub's a friend or at least pretends to be one.
based on how they were killed, he wanted to see them suffer.
he's sadistic. Mm-hmm. And mission oriented.
Dragging's usually associated with hate crimes, but neither victim was a minority nor gay.
actually, dragging is steeped in English history.
back in the 11th Century, drawing and quartering was a common form of punishment, and in fact, they would also disembowel and behead the victims when they were done with them.
but that didn't happen here.
maybe this is just a serial killer who crosses city lines.
I don't know. Two victims in 3 hours? That's a spree. - Our unsub may claim another victim soon.
which is why we're headed west. We'll land in Orange County, half of us will go to San Diego, the other half L. A.
wheels up in 30.
wait. Wait. Come back! What did I do to?!
please don't do this!
No! Oh, no, no!
Ralph Steadman wrote, "evil is always devising more corrosive misery through man's restless need to exact revenge out of his hate.
all right, let's go to victimology.
neither of the victims was sexually assaulted or robbed.
well, Brenda was a teacher and a mother of two.
she went to meet a friend that night. Mm-hmm. And her husband backs the story.
and the other victim, Mark Coleman, was an addict.
he was killed in the parking lot of a drugstore around the corner from the sober living house.
a woman with no apparent addiction and a tweaker in a sober living house?
they probably don't know each other.
Garcia, did the unsub call the victims on the disposable cells prior to that night?
let's see. In the last few weeks, he called each of the victims over two times a day.
that's not random. It's hunting.
without phone transcripts, it's going to be hard to understand what the unsub's ruse was.
well, it ended pretty bad.
tying someone to the back of a car is horrific and uncharacteristically high-risk behavior.
it was pure torture. Skin was scraped off, bones were broken.
that's about desecrating the body.
well, our unsub is comfortable using chains and hitching equipment.
you know, the crimes could have been committed to promote fear.
all right, just- can we rewind for a second?
is it possible to kill someone in San Diego and then drive 212 hours up to L. A.
and then do it again?
if you drove a V8 engine with a single plane crankshaft 80 miles per hour in good traffic, you took the I-5 to the 405 to the 10 east, got off on La Cienega, went right on Washington, north on Vermont, and then snuck up Selma using the back alley, you could do it in an hour, 42 minutes, and still have time for tacos.
JJ, you and Morgan go to the latest crime scene.
Dave, you and Blake to San Diego to the medical examiner's, and Reid and I will go to the LAPD.
Los Angeles, CA
you gotta keep the barricades back. - JJ.
the blood trail ends about 3 blocks away where the body was found.
this is where he was tied to the car.
what's up with the drugstore? - It was closed Friday. They're in the middle of a remodel.
that's convenient.
Yes. So is the fact that the camera's not working.
so the unsub drags Mark over here, then blitz attacks him from behind.
OK, if the killer knew the drugstore was closed and the cameras weren't working, he wasn't expecting anyone here.
and he scoped out the nearby streets.
he knew there'd be low traffic, so he could drag the victims without being caught.
what if Mark was falling off the wagon and he was meeting his dealer?
right? Like the first victim also met the unsub in a parking lot.
maybe she had a drug habit, too.
it's possible. But either way, our unsub is highly organized.
Hello?
Oh, hi.
I can't do it today.
I know. I'm really sorry.
next week. Promise.
can't wait to see you later.
me, too.
name the place.
the desk sergeant.
Hi, I'm Detective Pratt. You must be SSA Hotchner.
I am. This is Dr. Spencer Reid. - Pleasure.
well, I talked to San Diego PD.
they sent over everything on the first victim Brenda Wipley's case.
and Mr. Coleman's updated file's on the conference room table. - I'll start looking them over.
now, should we notify the press that we're looking for a spree killer?
not until we know exactly what we're looking for.
OK. You guys can set up right in here. - Thank you.
morgan and JJ think that maybe our second victim Mark went to meet a drug dealer. Have you gotten the tox screens back?
neither of the victims had drugs in their system. - It doesn't mean they didn't go meet a dealer.
but a drug dealer doesn't call you twice a day for two weeks. Usually you call him.
go ahead, Garcia. - The path of my cyber sleuthing has had majestic results.
digging into victim number two's past, it turns out meth isn't the only thing Mark Coleman had done.
he also changed his last name. - From what?
Logan. And that's where the plot thickens like a bad pudding.
so when Mark was a junior in college, he gets picked up by police on a drug charge.
they find some articles of clothing of a missing 8-year-old girl named Kelly Taylor in his car.
they are covered with Mark's DNA.
after a lengthy interrogation, he confesses to sexually assaulting her, but denies killing her, and because her body was never found, they couldn't link him to the disappearance.
what's he been doing since he got out? - Eating hamburgers.
he got released a month ago. Since then he's worked at 3 different fast food joints.
send me everything you've got on the case. I'll have Reid go talk to the family.
Yeah.
outside. - I was having my soup.
now.
Thanks. Garcia was only able to give away 25 of my vacation days to employees with loved ones in Afghanistan.
well, great. Now you just have to figure out what to do with the remaining 6.
Hey. I'm Dr. Mathis.
I heard it took the L. A. M. E. 4 hours to find the second victim's entire body.
Yeah, he was spread all over the place.
well, victim one had it easy by comparison.
she was dragged postmortem. - We thought she was alive at first.
no. She died from a series of blows to the head.
so the unsub was scared on his first kill, then two hours later when he got his second victim, his confidence suddenly evolved.
that's a pretty quick evolution.
and therein lies the problem.
so I talked to victim number two's father.
he said as far as he knew, no one was trying to get back at Mark for the rape.
he got out of jail last month.
he was getting out more, exercising, trying to get on with his life.
well, I just compared photos from the first and second crime scenes.
the cars used to drag were different.
maybe the killer switched cars? - Or we're looking at two unsubs.
what did you and Morgan find?
well, at both crime scenes, the nearby stores were either closed or being remodeled, so the killer would have had to scope the area, lure and drag the victim without being caught.
this guy has a lot to do. So the question remains, how can you do that twice in one night in cities over 100 miles apart?
two unsubs would explain the evolution in M. O.
what did Rossi and Blake say? - The first victim Brenda was dragged postmortem.
the second victim was alive.
so we're most likely looking at one unsub who's hesitant and another one who actually enjoys it.
what do you mean, you killed her first? - I just couldn't do it while she was still alive.
but that's the whole point. Come on, you know what she did.
I know. But she was begging for her life and I just couldn't hear it anymore.
Oh, you should have called me. - You had your own thing to do.
OK, we've been planning this thing for 6 months.
if you thought you were gonna chicken out, you should have told me at last week's meeting.
OK, we're done now, so let's just go home and pretend this never happened.
no. We're not going anywhere.
when I killed Mark, he told me there were two other guys that helped.
what?
he didn't do this alone?
so what are we gonna do now? - We're gonna kill them. That is what we're gonna do.
I can't do this again!
Yes. Yes. Yes, Darlene, you can.
I don't know...
Darlene, if we don't do this, who else will?
we know most teams work together, two unsubs versus one victim.
here we have a team that's 120 miles apart using similar M. O.s on radically different victims.
OK, so how do we think they met?
something in the victimology should tell us.
well, we know that victim number two, Mark Coleman, has a sketchy background. What if victim number one was hiding something as well?
let's start digging.
who the hell are you?
you thought you could rape and kill an 8-year-old and get away with it?
I don't know what you're talking about. - Yeah. That's not what Mark said!
OK. Ok. I was there, but I didn't do anything. - Shut up!
I thought if I tried to stop them, they'd hurt me. - Imagine how Kelly felt.
what are you doing? - Let's just kill him now.
no, that's too easy. Now get in the car. - You don't need to do this!
karma's a bitch, isn't it?
I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything!
No! Help!
come on!
no, no, I didn't do anything!
help! Please help!
I didn't do anything! Help!
what did you find? - Paul Montgomery was alive when he was dragged.
and it turns out Paul worked the late shift nearby.
my officers found blood around his vehicle.
he was probably blitz attacked when he left work.
did we find his cell? - Yeah, it was on the ground.
but he had no text messages or prior calls. - That's a change in M. O.
usually they lure their victims out.
what happened to their organization?
Garcia, what did you find out about Paul Montgomery? - So guess who were BFFs in college.
hmm. Mark Coleman and Paul? - 10 points to Blakendore.
turns out Paul was a character witness in Mark Coleman's rape trial.
he waxed poet about his boy. The jury didn't care.
so we have two scumbags and an innocent mom as victims.
anything in Brenda Wipley's past?
no, not that I've found yet. She went to college at UCLA, she went to high school in Orange County.
does she have a sealed juvie record? - Why didn't I think of that?
see, this is why you're the boss man and I'm the minion who types things.
uh, it turns out Brenda was not as coifed as her bob.
when she was 17, she was involved in a DUI that resulted in the death of a 2-year-old boy, Sam Dolan.
did she serve time? - Yeah, she was sentenced to a year in juvie.
it was reduced to two months after her father gave hefty chunks of change??
so, we're definitely looking at a vigilante team avenging the death of these two kids.
we should talk to the parents of the original victims.
I'll bet they're the connection to these unsubs. Thanks, Garcia.
thank you for coming in, Mr. Dolan.
that was taken at his second birthday.
his mom sent one to everyone.
I know this is hard, but I need to ask you some questions about the death of the woman who killed your son.
like I told the cops,
I was returning home from London the night Brenda was murdered.
I have my boarding pass.
OK. Now, what about your wife? Where was she?
she killed herself a few years ago.
I am so sorry to hear that.
she said she was getting better, and
but ever since Sam's death, she was a mess.
do you think the lenient sentence was a contributing factor in her death?
Absolutely. She thought the system failed us.
she wouldn't leave the house after that.
she even did therapy over the phone.
did she have friends over? - No.
she spent all her time on the Internet. - Really?
did she join any online support groups?
how'd you know?
she said it was making her better.
but I-I thought it was making her worse. - Why?
because it allowed her to obsess about it.
Oh, no. Not again.
I can't do this.
I thought it was gonna help, but it isn't.
that's because you're not letting it. - But it's wrong.
an eye for an eye? It's biblical.
when I wake up in the morning,
I see Kelly's face.
when I close my eyes, she's still there.
I don't know how much longer I can go on like this.
don't. Don't you say that. - But that's how I feel.
you should feel rejuvenated.
come here. Come on. Come on.
look. Look at you.
they did this. They did this to you.
so don't tell me they don't deserve what's coming to them.
order's up. - Thanks.
just finished my interview. Sam Dolan's father checks out.
his mother committed suicide a few years ago.
what about Kelly's parents? - We've left them messages, but...
you might send an officer to their house and places of employment.
we should also check at the support group Sam's mother belonged to.
well, we got something. The calls the unsub made to the victims- twice a day at night.
that shows incredible persistence.
the first victim, Brenda, was a happily married teacher, so why would she take calls from a random man late at night?
if she was cheating, she wouldn't meet someone at a restaurant near her house.
I think she was meeting a woman.
the roommate said the second victim, Mark, in a sober living house said that he was talking to someone online a lot lately.
the night he got killed, he got dressed up like he was going out on a date.
and he's straight, which further confirms it was a female. - That would explain the blitz attacks.
they weren't because our unsubs were insecure men, they were because our unsubs are women, who needed to subdue their victims first.
we need to give the profile.
we believe that these unsubs are two women who are killing people convicted of heinous crimes.
you son of a bitch! You son of a bitch!
he'll be out in 10 years.
unlike solo vigilantes, they're working in concert and they're planning and executing coordinated attacks.
their mentality is like a lynch mob.
they believe the justice system has gone wrong and it's up to them to set it right.
due to the pre-planning and level of commitment, we believe our unsubs are over 30.
and they probably learned about the crimes they're avenging through the media.
it's possible they were involved in these losses personally and now feel they need to act.
No! I don't accept it!
my baby's life was worth more than 10 years!
this latest attack felt more improvised and personal.
they didn't lure their victim.
rather, they blitz attacked him outside of his job.
now, during a spree, the threat is that an unsub will either strike again or disappear.
now, if they've completed their vendetta, then the latter is more likely.
our unsubs may not have prior criminal histories, as they see themselves as do-gooders.
based on the fact that one victim was dragged postmortem and the other were dragged alive, we believe that one woman is not as confident in the mission while the other is more domineering.
we're looking for mothers, relatives, friends who have lost children.
we also need to look at the collateral damage of the crimes our current victims committed years ago.
since this is the only thing our unsubs have in common, it tell us that as time goes on, their friendship will become strained and ultimately fall apart.
so how do these unsubs meet? - Maybe they're involved in the trials.
in two different cities? - I don't know.
if Sam Dolan's mom was in an online support group, maybe after she killed herself, someone else became obsessed with her grief.
Yeah, but who'd have that same level of interest?
let me call Garcia.
Hey, Garcia. - At your service.
were you able to find out anything about that online support group Mrs. Dolan was in?
uh, let me see. Uh, uh, uh, it had 200 members. It was an anonymous group.
did any of them start talking about Sam Dolan about two months ago, after his mother's suicide?
OK, uh, I've got a screen name, Ellen R.
from San Diego. She talked about Sam in a private chat room.
did Sam Dolan's mom have any friends or relatives with that name?
Yeah, she's got a sister Ellen Russel.
she works in a boat shop. And that'd give her access to hitching equipment.
who was she interacting with in the support group? - She talked to a lot of people.
in the last year, she was mainly talking to a Darlene B.
Kelly Taylor's mom's name is Darlene. - What's her maiden name?
Beckett. In the last 6 months, most of their discussions have been around the pending release of Mark Coleman from prison.
and they probably hatched a plan.
we need to get search warrants for Ellen's and Darlene's houses.
Oh, my gosh! This just in. So when Mark was released a month ago, her and Ellen started calling him, posing as a friend.
that would explain the disposable cell phones. - That's the trigger. Mark's release set them off.
Yeah, right, great. So Ellen was still mad because there was no justice served for her nephew's death, and...her and Darlene must have agreed to swap revenge killings.
and they'd avoid getting caught.
it's like "Strangers on a Train." - Yeah, but this ain't Hitchcock, folks.
why kill Paul? He was just a character witness for Mark.
a character witness who traveled 300 miles once a week to see his friend in prison.
friends usually distance themselves from rapists and murderers.
unless you're involved. - Garcia, you and JJ look into Kelly's disappearance.
we need to find out how these unsubs got to Paul and anybody else who might have been involved in the case.
all right, I'll let him know. Ok. Got it.
my officers just interviewed Darlene's ex-husband.
he says she hasn't been the same since Kelly disappeared.
she's been suffering from chronic depression.
the loss of a child either brings you together or breaks you apart.
viva Mexico!
the day she disappeared, Kelly left school early because she and her mother were going on vacation, but she never made it home.
they found her underwear in Mark's car, which led to his confession.
I got the lab results back from Kelly's rape.
it turns out there was a second DNA sample on her underwear, but it's too degraded to make a match.
maybe the women suspected it was Paul's.
San Diego PD just searched Ellen's house.
she's not there, but they put an officer out front just in case she comes back.
so we need to figure out who Paul was to Mark in college.
they ran cross-country, sometimes participating in a relay together.
it means they were close.
don't 4 people do relays?
Hey, baby girl.
Hey. - Listen, we need to figure out who ran in the cross-country relay with Paul Montgomery and Mark Coleman.
Bryce Phillips and Jason Nelson. They look inseparable.
and where are they now?
Bryce lives in Amsterdam, Jason in the Los Feliz area of Los Angeles.
and what was Jason's relationship with Mark like when he went to jail?
Jason was at the hearing and he visited Mark once a week in prison, so, close?
he probably participated in the crime. - And our killing duo found out about it.
that would explain the change in M. O. Maybe Mark gave a dying declaration and gave up his boys.
maybe our ladies are improvising, which explains killing Paul outside his job.
we need to get to Jason's house before they do.
today's your lucky day, Jason.
who are you? - Kelly's mom.
you remember Kelly, don't you?
Oh-I can explain. I can explain.
too late.
I'll do anything you want. Ok? I could take you to her body.
her body?
you know where my baby is?
Yeah, yeah. I can take you there.
if I do that, you'll let me go, right?
clear.
guys, there's broken glass over here.
and blood on the floor.
Morgan! JJ! Search the bedrooms.
Blake, check outside, see if Jason was dragged.
I am serious. I am not
I'm not the same guy that I used to be.
shut up! - I think about what I did to her every day.
which way? - I- right.
I- I-I have a girlfriend now, and I have a good job.
I've changed. - Change is crap.
OK? People just become more of who they are. - You don't know me.
tell me what you did to my daughter that day. - Darlene...
where did you take her? - Don't answer that.
I have the right to know.
it's complicated.
she was 8 years old. You tell me what you did to her!
he was into improving himself.
let's do healthy relationships.
go figure.
guy seems in love.
OK.
uh...It was, uh...
it was hot that day.
we were all just sitting around getting high, and then out of the blue, Mark asked if, uh, if any one of us had ever been with a... with a little girl.
I mean, of course we said-we said no, but then someone said...
that we should go and get one.
and the next thing we know, we were out on the corner.
we're waiting and...
I- I- we were just about to leave...
when your daughter walked by.
and so you thought, we'll just snatch this little black girl.
Hey. It had nothing to do with race.
my best friend is black. It's just...
Oh, Kelly, she was just-she was so pretty. Oh
that's enough!
Oh, we just lit up. Oh...
mommy should have been on time.
son of a bitch!
come on. What are you doing? - Oh, you think this is funny?
I have been dying to tell that story for so long.
stop it! Stop it!
are you serious? - I need to find her.
I need to bring her back home.
she is dead! And we are killing this guy.
no, I can't! I have got to bring her back home.
Ellen, closure is important to a mom.
and, uh...
besides, to protect myself, I told a neighbor to write down the license plate of any strange car that came by.
so... you were expecting us?
well, I knew you found the first two.
I assumed I'd be next.
UCCH. Why are men so messy?
I don't get down like this. I'm a clean freak.
why does that not surprise me?
something's just... off about this guy.
gut feeling? - Deep gut.
Jennifer Jareau, your gut knows what it's talking about.
so nothing about Jason Nelson seems out of the ordinary?
he seems as all-American as apple pie.
no reports of any bodies found. - Maybe they haven't killed him yet.
we'll keep you posted.
this guy might give these ladies a run for their money.
trophies. Kelly wasn't the only girl.
this is all a facade. Jason's a psychopath.
a psychopath versus two vigilantes.
I have a feeling this is not going to end well.
is this it? Is this where you put Kelly?
what do you mean? You said this was where she is.
well, I will take you there if you do something for me.
No! This is not a negotiation.
no. It's a bribe.
what do you want? - Kill someone.
anyone.
and then I'll tell you where it is.
you want us to just kill some random person? - That's what I said.
I want you to know how good I felt. - That's disgusting!
we're not murderers.
Oh, really? That's not what it looks like from here.
and besides, if you don't do it, my neighbor will drop a dime on you, remember?
you didn't tell your neighbor. - You'll never know.
Darlene, do you want to find your daughter or not?
not like this.
you don't have a choice, ladies. - Yeah, we do!
Darlene, just do it. - I can't!
damn it!
awesome!
Oh, no, no, no!
now you take us to her daughter.
now, or you're next.
the victim says he was shot by a white woman.
she was with a black woman and a white guy.
these women have been so specific about their victims up until this point, why shoot a random person?
Jason's a psychopath. Maybe he made them do it.
he could be holding them hostage. - Or he's got something that's keeping him alive.
a bargaining chip? - Maybe he knows where Kelly's body's buried.
but Ellen did the shooting, not Darlene.
Ellen tortured the second victim.
and she's helping Darlene kill the rest of Kelly's assailants, when she could have just walked away.
so this woman is a psychopath, too.
then Jason's made a love connection.
and he'll probably try to manipulate Ellen to do something worse.
we lost these women a long time ago.
Blake, turn Jason's place upside down.
we need to find where they may have put Kelly's body.
Ellen, why?!
now, why did you go and do that?! - We have come too far.
bull. She liked it. - No, she didn't.
tell him you didn't like that.
Oh, oh, you know, if we were smart, Ellen, we'd partner up.
shut up!
we could drive across the country just killing people.
I'd get my little girls, and you can get, you know, whoever you wanted.
that's enough! - Wouldn't it be great...
to live in a world where no one judged you?
I wouldn't judge you, baby. I would have your back. Come on.
come on, what do you say?
if we are not at that body in the next 20 minutes,
I'm gonna take that gun and shove it so far down your throat, you're gonna wish you were dead.
Yeah, yeah... just make a left.
this is getting exciting.
hmm hmm hmm, let's see.
I think it was over here to the right.
you think or you know?
I know. I just moved it.
why would you do that? - When Mark died, I needed to cover my tracks.
it's right here. I remember.
right...Here. Start digging.
the landlord says this is Jason's storage closet.
it looks like my storage unit.
my husband has so much crap, it's not funny.
is it hard being in a relationship with someone overseas? - We make it work.
working for Doctors Without Borders is a very noble cause.
I would imagine you guys have an epistolary novel by now, though.
we stick to Skype. It's modern.
when we're together, it's like we're dating, and when we're not, I get stuff done.
look at this.
fresh loam soil.
usually found near plains and streams.
either he was just camping... - Or used it to move the body.
Jason finds out his friends are killed, he might take precautions.
what is taking so long? - I'm almost there.
hurry up!
there it is.
that's just a skull.
Where's the rest of my daughter?
we have a few more holes to dig.
you cut up my baby?
that was my idea, too.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
there's loam soil surrounding some Southern California beaches and also loam soil around some parks in the area.
what areas are near running trails?
uh, there is a trail in the Hollywood Hills area that is lousy with loam soil.
and I'm sending Morgan and Rossi to the location now.
over here.
they got him.
we've got officers at Ellen and Darlene's homes just in case they come back.
and have them check the airports, bus stations, train stations, everything.
I'll also put an APB out along the coast.
Garcia cross-checked the trophies we found at Jason's, and they match articles from 3 different missing children.
and have officers excavate the area around where Jason's body was found.
there may be more bodies there. - I'm on it.
at least we got Jason. He could have kept killing forever.
and the women just get away. - Hmm. For now.
you ok? - Yeah.
Yeah.
so now what?
well, um, we're gonna split up.
I might keep heading south. You'd do good here.
Yeah. You're right.
I think it's better if we don't stay together.
you know what I don't get?
how this was so easy for you.
how so? We had to kill 5 people.
our deal was just for two. - That's not what I'm talking about.
does it bother you that none of this took the hurt away?
I never thought it would.
then why did we do it?
because somebody has to pay, ok?
I don't care what anybody says. Actions have consequences.
maybe not at trial.
maybe not in jail.
come on. Admit it, Darlene, this gave you a reason to live.
that's what I was hoping.
but it just made me feel more...
more nothing.
then you're a wuss.
I'm gonna go get us something cold to drink.
wait. I diss you and you care if I'm thirsty?
huh. You gotta start thinking about yourself, honey.
that's the game.
dollars ok? - Gracias.
how'd you find me?
Darlene never unpacked her daughter's bags from this trip.
and I took a wild guess.
so what happens now?
what happens now is you go back to the U. S.
I take 6 days off that I don't even want.
Where's Darlene?
she's long gone.
personally, I have mixed feelings about that one.
but we'll get her, too.
Levantese.
...a Los estados unidos. - Thanks for your help.
paul Brown once said, "If you win, say nothing.

here
hello.
Hello, sir. I just wanted to remind you that our normal checkout time is 11 a. m.
but if you'd like a later checkout time, I can go ahead and take care of that for you now.
sir, would you like a later checkout time?
sir?
Hello?
are you there?
no. No.
the SIGN OF FOUR
Hello? What's wrong?
nothing.
well, it's not Sunday. We talk on Sunday.
I know. I, um, I just thought I'd call.
you scared me. Sorry.
I thought it was an emergency.
no, it's not an emergency.
yeah? Are you sure? How are your headaches?
good. I mean-- I mean they're gone.
yeah? Are you taking your riboflavin and the magnesium?
in equal doses and a sporadic shot of B2 like you said.
and sleep? Are you letting your gray matter rest?
I'm--I'm working on it.
what's so funny? What? I didn't laugh.
something's amusing you. I can hear it.
you can hear my body language? I'm a very good listener.
I guess I just-- I think it's funny how we've been doing this for 6 months and we've never met.
you know, like one Google search of me and you'll find my FBI file photo, but I have absolutely no idea what you look like. I've shaved, by the way, since then.
I used to be sort of fascinated with the yeti and I thought that maybe if I
I don't know what you look like either.
Really? No.
the only intimate part of you I've seen is your brain when I studied the MRI you sent me.
that's when I said, this is a guy I need to get to know.
Thanks. That's really nice of you to say.
what happened?
something just happened.
sorry. It's work. I actually have to go.
OK. Well, uh, we'll talk Sunday.
be safe. - Ok.
wait. Are you being safe?
Yes. Yes, I'm being safe.
do you--do you think he knows about us?
no. As far as I can tell he doesn't.
and we need to keep it that way.
well, my friends, you are heading to New Mexico.
but pack your thermals, 'cause this case will make you go "brr.
our unsub du jour is taking right legs. The most recent victim, Tony Anders.
he was dumped at a local motel.
he's in surgery now. Looks like he's gonna pull through.
the first victim, not so lucky. Richard Hubbell.
he died during the leg absconding process, and his body was dumped just over the border in Juarez, Mexico.
Juarez is on the front lines of the cartels. Any drug connections between the victims?
they both just said no.
Tony Anders had I. V. bruising and surgical sutures on his stump.
so the unsub operated on both victims. We're looking at a doctor.
that's a first.
were the victims patients anywhere? No. They were the vision of health.
Tony had hypodermic needle marks on his neck.
the unsub could have drugged him and brought him into the hospital for surgery.
unlikely he could hide in a hospital.
even the most experienced surgeon can't operate without supervision.
the goal of amputation is to remove dead tissue to preserve an otherwise healthy limb.
any first-year medical student will tell you that.
but this unsub stitched the skin flap so tightly over Tony's stump that it didn't allow for proper blood flow and led to gangrene.
he's not a surgeon. What is he?
a butcher.
what happened?
everything's fine. Was there...
was there an accident?
it's fine. Everything's fine. We just need to operate.
operate?
no, it's ok. It's ok. You're in good hands.
did someone call my wife? She should know.
I will take care of it.
I should really call her, because she'll be worried. I told you, we'll take care of it.
I, uh, have coverage.
my HMO hospital is St. Mary's, I think.
is this--am I at St. Mary's?
not quite.
Hey, what are you doing?
sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote, "When a doctor does go wrong, he is the first of criminals.
he has the nerve and he has the knowledge.
so, this unsub's got a thing for right legs and he's moving fast.
two victims in a week. What's the compulsion?
you know, the fact that one of the victims was left in a motel room makes me think it's not a compulsion at all. Maybe it's black market.
what's the going rate for a leg these days? Mm, pretty good.
in 2002, tendons were shipped from South Africa to the U. S.
and sold through private medical and biotech companies.
the body parts trade coexists with the drug trade in border towns.
let's say it's a chop shop.
that means we're looking for a small team or network.
one that usually deals with the dead before the living.
did Garcia find any overlap with victimology? Just that they were both organ donors.
she cross-referencing with the United Network for Organ Sharing.
u. N.O. S. deals with vital organs, but we're talking limbs.
Yeah, but hospitals around the country are networked into it.
if the unsub is a medical professional, he might have access to it, and by extension, the victims.
Reid, you and JJ go to Juarez and look at Richard Hubbell's body.
morgan and Dave, go talk to Tony Anders.
and Blake and I will investigate the black market angle here.
Albuquerque POLICE DEPARTMENT
Hey. Detective Gonzalez.
I'm glad you guys could make it. I hate the weird ones.
I'm Agent Hotchner. This is Agent Blake.
thanks for inviting us. Absolutely. Come on in.
I've got the board set up for you in here.
thank you. Thank you.
go ahead, Garcia. You're on speaker.
OK, so I quadruple-checked with U. N.O. S and there's no way the unsub is using them, because like me, they quadruple-check everything and their redundancies have redundancies, and so there's no chance there could be any hanky-panky.
he could still be using medical records to find them, though.
all right, thanks, Garcia. Welcome, welcome.
were you able to contact the specialist we asked about? The doctor who sold on the black market?
Yeah. The prison said no way they would release him.
we'll just have to go to him, then.
I remember...
walking out of organic chemistry, and...
then...
nothing.
what about when you woke up? There was a...
beeping, like that, and there was a mask...
over my face, I think.
I can't remember, man. It's all a blur.
Tony, do me a favor.
close your eyes.
just humor me, ok?
all right. Think back to that room.
that bed. That beeping.
it probably smelled a lot like this room.
you were out. You should have stayed out.
but you didn't.
now... Wake up!
Tony, something just came to you. What was it?
I can't explain it. Don't think it, just say it.
it was a door.
a garage door.
I was in somebody's garage.
I need to, uh, ask you some questions.
if you want this to go well,
I suggest you answer honestly.
have you eaten anything in the past 12 hours?
uh, yeah.
have you consumed alcohol?
no. Just wait a-- You had surgery before?
Yes. Please, just tell me-- Any complications?
no, no. It was Lasik.
anything you'd like to ask before we begin?
why are you doing this to me?
now, I'm going to count backwards from 10.
10... Please--please
good afternoon. I'm Alex Blake with the FBI.
I'm here to see if you can cooperate on this
let me see the file.
right now it's just a missing limb case.
your expertise can tell us if he's selling legs on the black market.
we felt that to find the best, we should go to the best.
can you help us, Mr. Smith?
first of all, it's Dr. Smith, not Mr. Smith.
second, the only way I'll give you my expert opinion is if we cut a deal, right now.
I could do that...
or I could stop wasting my time with you. This guy's not doing it for the money.
if you knew that for sure you wouldn't be here.
what I do know is what kind of medicine you practiced.
what do the eyes go for in Beijing, a grand?
the skin you sent to Moscow, that netted you what, 15?
so when you looked at the last picture, I know what you saw.
you saw an amateur who could make a lot more money if he took more than the right leg.
after all, you did. Listen, Agent.
actually, it's doctor. Unlike you, I still have my degree.
but you have a good day, Mr. Smith.
it could be dumping the body down here was a forensic countermeasure.
probably, but it's the deviation in M. O. that stumps me.
pun intended. Two different victims, two different amputations.
all right, so what do you see, doctor?
this amputation was transtibial, but the survivor was transfemoral.
so his leg was cut below the knee, and Tony's was cut above.
the cutting here was pristine, nerve and vascular dissection was careful, well-ligated.
I mean, this unsub definitely knew what he was doing medically.
I thought you said the unsub wasn't a doctor.
I said he wasn't a surgeon, but his knowledge of anatomy and procedure shows definite medical training.
Hey, Spence. The hole in the bone-- it's perfectly circular.
the medical examiner said that was most likely caused by animals.
it's bored in. It's like he drilled it.
not with any surgical tool that I'm familiar with.
well, maybe this is what he's been trying to hide from us.
based on the way this unsub treats his victims, we need to look at this case a different way.
we know it's not for profit and we know he's not a killer.
so what is he? A scientist, or at least he sees himself that way.
which means he sees his victims as test subjects.
and if we're right, we're not going to see the usual signature or consistent victimology.
there's no compulsion, sexual or otherwise.
so there won't be a trigger or a stressor either. That doesn't leave a lot to profile.
not true. We do have his medical technique.
and based on the remnants of Hubbell's surgery, I think the unsub's experimenting.
with what? A new way to amputate?
the hole in his knee makes us think it's more radical than that.
amputating the leg is not the unsub's goal. Reattaching it is.
you think this unsub's performing transplants? It explains why he only wanted Tony Anders' leg.
I think that's the experiment.
he wants to see if he can put a foreign leg on someone else's body.
can you
can you help-- can you--can you help
ma'am, the doctor can't diagnose you over the phone.
ma'am, I don't know what you want me to do.
you need to come in. The doctor can't diagnose you over the phone.
please... I need someone...
no, ma'am, I'm sorry. You need to come in.
somebody help me!
Hey, sir, what's your problem?
it's my leg. Ok, does it hurt?
no, it's been cut. Ok. Can you get me some scissors?
OK, what happened? Did you cut it?
it's not...
My...leg.
did the camera pick up anything? He dropped him off a block away.
this poor guy limped into the hospital on a leg that wasn't his.
what's the note say?
the unsub helpfully suggests a high dose of cyclosporine for his patient,
it wouldn't have made any difference. I mean, gangrene and sepsis had already set in.
there's nothing the hospital could have done. Reid, you getting a migraine?
no. No, I haven't had one of those for months, ever since, um...
this doesn't make any sense, Morgan. Well, does it ever, Reid?
this unsub is supposed to have a background in science, right?
why is his science so bad?
he amputated Carl's leg, sewed it up, and then reopened the sutures for transplant?
you find anything on the knee?
he left his handiwork in this time.
it's a surgical implant.
maybe that's what he was trying to perfect, transplanting the leg onto an amputee.
medically impossible. You can't graft a leg onto someone else's stump.
well, you and I know that, and this guy must know that, but maybe he just won't stop until he succeeds.
a doctor that can't admit he's wrong? It's time to give the profile.
the unsub we're looking for is a doctor with a severe God complex.
his narcissism makes him believe that he can defy human biology and anatomy.
his narcissism has likely caused problems in his career.
so look for doctors who've lost their licenses or medical students who've had ethical violations.
with a psychopath like this, shouldn't we also be looking at released mental patients?
we don't think he is a psychopath.
psychopaths rarely have the training and discipline for medical school or residency.
so this unsub won't behave in an antisocial manner.
he's probably successful, respectful, outgoing.
we think that he can maintain healthy relationships, and his neighbors probably know him well.
and his background makes us think he lives a mid- to upper class lifestyle.
he may be married and have kids. If so, he would be devoted to both.
so don't look for the weirdo in the van with no windows.
look for the pillars of the community.
Yeah, but if he's so well-known, how's he hiding these operations from all these people?
through a psychological process called doubling.
he acts one way professionally, but he acts another way at home.
it's occurred before in history. Like the Nazi doctors in Auschwitz and Dachau.
they could separate their genocidal actions from their normal lives as fathers, healers, and husbands.
and like the doctors under Hitler's regime, this unsub's sense of superiority supersedes the Hippocratic oath.
Yes, well, the trial phase is almost complete.
I'll, uh, I'll send it to you once I've compiled it.
Yes. Yes, thank you.
that didn't sound good.
the investors want to see all my data.
and you're not ready.
I came close last night, but...
I'm in trouble. Ok, breathe, honey.
we're gonna get through this. If they pull their funding
they won't. - we lose everything. The equipment in the garage, the house.
it's not going to happen. How do you know that?
because I know you.
but you have to let yourself off the hook if you're gonna figure this out.
I almost had it, you know? That's what's so frustrating.
if I could just get it right one time, you and I can-- we can lead a better life.
honey, I have a great life. Don't worry about me.
worry about those little mice out in your lab.
hmm. Well, I hate to tell you, but I've moved up from mice in the last couple of weeks.
OK. Whatever critters you have out there, I don't want to know.
but if it's a choice between them or the house, well, a couple more might have to give their life up to science.
Oh, I love you so much.
stop worrying.
well, these are doctors and med students in the area, and there are a lot of washouts who fit the profile.
what about the prosthetic attachment from Carl Timmons' leg?
is there anything identifiable on it?
Yeah. I just sent you the chemical breakdown from our lab.
it's mostly a thick polymer designed to withstand the constant mobility of the leg.
so the resin is coated in plastic?
Mm-hmm. It's a combination of organic and inorganic materials.
that's probably to stave off rejection. Garcia, is the resin biodegradable?
as a matter of fact, yes. How is it you know everything?
all this time we assumed he's a doctor. But what if he isn't?
what if he has the training in cutting and stitching but never went to medical school?
where do you get training like that? I see.
so you think this man is a mortician. It's one of the theories we're pursuing.
but we think this implant is the key to his training.
is this something your employees would use?
Yes. We use it for reattachment on our dearly beloved.
sometimes they come to us in more than one piece, and we need to perform some...reassembly for an open casket funeral.
the biodegradability is for what, cremation? Precisely.
and unlike a surgeon, a mortician would want to reattach a limb at a movable joint like a knee or an elbow?
it's easier to use dead bone than muscle or vasculature.
would you excuse me? Thank you for your help.
of course.
so, we know the unsub got started in a place like this, but how's he finding his victims now?
well, he's equipped his garage with medical equipment.
he might not be a doctor, but he could be posing as one.
look, I'm sorry, but I can't remember anyone like you're talking about.
now, just take a second and think.
is there any medical care that you've had that this guy could have had access to.
I haven't even been sick lately. Did you change doctors?
what doctor? I'm in college. How about student health services?
or an outreach on campus.
a health drive. Maybe you gave blood.
wait a second. Yeah. I give blood all the time.
when was the last time?
a couple weeks ago. It was a long line because there was just one guy in the truck.
what did the guy look like?
I don't remember. I was more focused on the needle going into my arm.
but you gave him your contact info, your medical history.
Yeah. Absolutely. That's how he found you.
shopping cart return -Hi -Hi
you said there was something wrong with my test?
it's probably nothing. We just need to take another sample.
help...
what is wrong? - Help me.
Please...please...
help me.
please.
I can't.
the victim's name is Maria Rodriguez. First time he's operated on a woman.
he transplanted a left leg this time. She died from blood loss.
there's no gangrene on the transplanted leg, which means the surgery's fresh.
you think he still has the other woman? It justifies his haste in dumping her here.
why didn't he go to the desert or a hospital?
it also means he's speeding up his surgeries. Reid, where are you going?
Yeah, yeah, I'm still combing through morticians. Garcia, I actually need something else.
can you tell me where the nearest pay phone is? Sorry?
pay phone. Like a phone you pay to make phone calls on.
Oh, my sweet analog Luddite. That is what your cell is for.
Garcia, please. Ok.
someone is being mysterious. It's gonna take me a second.
pay phones gave gone the way of the Dodo birds. They don't show up on Google maps.
all right, try local telecoms. Yes, I know that. I'm doing it right now.
and there is one 5 miles away.
I just texted it to your cell phone, which you can also use to call people.
thanks much.
Alex. Blake, wait. Where are you going?
Hotch called. He wants us back at the station ASAP.
can you give me a ride to 5th and Main? It's on the way.
uh...yeah, sure. What's at 5th and Main? I need to talk to somebody.
Uh...ok, sure.
what... What happened?
you survived the surgery.
quite well, in fact.
surgery? What are you
Oh, my God. I know.
Congratulations.
whose--whose leg is that?
Ah. She didn't survive the transplant.
but you did. I can't...
I can't move it.
you will, in a few days.
just relax.
now that I've found a suitable match, I'll let you rest a little before we do the next one.
no. No, wait.
please. Please. Don't take my other leg!
please!
do you want me to wait?
uh, you know, it might take a while, so I'll just take a cab back. Thanks anyway.
what's the deal? Something's not right, Spencer.
what do you mean? Why did you come back?
don't answer a question with a question.
look, a while back, I had some medical issues
headaches--and there was a geneticist that I reached out to.
and this has to do with the case how?
I think that my friend might be able to help me see something that we missed.
you have 4 of the best minds I know back at the station.
I know, but sometimes a different perspective helps me think better, ok?
why are you being so ambiguous? I don't know what you mean?
you're not using words like him or her.
you're saying things like "they are," "my friends.
so? It begs a bigger question.
why did you ask me to bring you here?
can we just talk about this later, please? No. Why not Morgan or JJ?
Alex, please-- Just answer the question!
because I don't want them to know about her. Ok?
it's nothing bad, it's just personal.
OK.
I'm here. I'm here. Spencer, why are you calling me right now?
I know. I know. It's important.
baby girl, what'd you find?
sorry, my love. There's no overlap between morticians and bloodmobile techs.
most of them are volunteers.
if this guy's running his own rig, he's not gonna show up.
what are we missing?
at first I just thought he was taking whoever was available. Except he's operating a bloodmobile.
Yes, thank you, exactly. That's not an accident.
he's obviously using it as a cover to screen for something, and that's why I'm calling you.
I'm hoping that you can help me figure out what he's screening for.
maybe the unsub is an amputee.
so he's working on a solution for his own condition.
the rest of the profile applies. He's got a God complex.
he thinks he's perfect. Infallible, even.
hard to maintain that if you're missing a leg. It's almost ironic.
most amputees have a healthier psychology than this unsub.
you know, what you're describing reminds me of Josef Mengele.
Yeah, we worked doubling into the profile. No, I mean Mengele's experiments on twins.
he operated on thousands of them. Why?
I don't know, actually.
he thought he could repopulate Germany faster if he could figure out a way to get women to conceive with multiple embryos.
so you think this guy's pursuing his own impossible cause.
what if he's not trying to fix himself, but somebody else?
that would fit his God complex.
like who? A spouse or a child, maybe.
someone he can ultimately heal by sacrificing these victims.
what is it? Everything ok? I need you to see something.
before he transplants, he turns them into amputees.
that's part of his experiment.
what if there's a condition the victim shares, something involving amputation?
it doesn't make sense. He couldn't screen for that genetically.
unless it's congenital, something that caused the amputation in utero?
the way Thalidomide caused birth defects in pregnant moms.
exactly. So I guess the question is, what else causes birth defects?
that's a long list. Chromosomal, fetal alcohol syndrome.
what if we focused on what causes limb deformities specifically?
uh, rubella, herpes, among others.
herpes is most common, but it isn't screened for when you donate blood.
but there are a lot of different strains of herpes.
you know, chickenpox, for instance.
if a mother isn't inoculated and she passes the virus in utero, can't that cause birth defects?
Yeah. Among other things, it can lead to limb hypoplasia.
the binding of which would appear similar to amputation.
but if it's a condition in the mother, why operate on men the first 3 times?
those were trial runs.
now that he's operating on women, he thinks he's found an answer.
move.
move!
you ready? Mm-hmm. Yeah.
OK.
OK.
honey, are you sure about this?
I promise. This is everything we've been working towards.
I'm ready for you, you son of a bitch!
look.
there she is.
there who is? -No!
John -No!
who? There who is? -NO!
what are you operating on out here?
I had a breakthrough. One of my subjects survived, but she's gone!
she's gone. - People?
you've been doing this to people?!
Linda! Linda! Linda! No! Help!
help!
what's happening?
Garcia, did you get the mortician's records? Ready and waiting.
isolate the married ones.
we're looking for limb deformities in the wife caused by chickenpox.
that's about as narrow as it gets.
Eureka! Linda Nelson, married to John Nelson. Quit his job at the funeral home two months ago.
sending address now. Take Rossi and JJ. Bring him in for questioning.
Thanks.
put down the scalpel. You come any closer and I take out her eye.
John! -Ok. Ok.
John! -Ok. Ok. You win.
you win. You can go.
go ahead. Ok? You can walk right out of here.
but please, just-- don't hurt her. Go ahead.
you can just walk right out, ok? There's the door.
see?
John! John, stop it! John, don't do this.
stop this! This is my success, honey.
she showed me what I was doing wrong. I don't care! She's a human being.
John Nelson, put the needle down.
I have potassium chloride in this.
if you don't get out of here right now, this is a dead woman.
John, don't do this! Doctor, the experiment is over.
if you kill her, no one will see your work.
my work. My work. You don't understand.
I've perfected this.
this is my last test. Drop it now!
then I can fix you.
I never wanted to be fixed.
Linda. Linda. You are the one that he loves.
you're the only one that can convince him what he's doing is wrong.
John. John, look at me.
it's over.
but...
I can make you better.
I'm not the one who's sick, John.
now drop the needle...
or I'll tell them to shoot.
Oh, John! It's ok. It's ok.
on your knees.
let's go.
body and soul cannot be separated for purposes of treatment, "for they are one indivisible.
sick minds must be healed as well as sick bodies.
Dr. Jeff Miller.
OK, kid.
out with it. Out with what?
out with the weirdness and the secrecy.
that phone call that you could only make out of a phone booth.
I got a consultation. What's the big deal?
Reid, you left that crime scene and came back with a major break.
that's one hell of a consult.
hmm. It was.
all right, you don't want to talk, that's fine.
but listen.
seriously, I
I feel like you and I haven't had a chance to talk in a while.
it's nobody's fault. It happens.
but if you've got somebody new in your life to talk to...
I'd just like to know who she is.
she's gotta be one hell of a woman to keep up with you.
who told you? Oh, just a little birdie.
you might know her. Garcia told me.
and she says you have been acting a little squirrelly.
so I just filled the rest in.
I don't know what you're talking about.
play on, playa.
thank you.
so I just wanted to say thank you. You really helped a lot.
I can't believe we've been able to talk this much.
3 times in one week. That's a new record.
I know. I like it. Maybe we could test it out.
you know, talking more often.
or not.
uh, I have to go. But why?
no, it's nothing.
you're not the only one that can hear body language.
did I--did I say something wrong? I, um...
I'm just not sure it's safe for us to talk right now.
do you think it's going to be like this forever?
I don't know. It's not how I want us to be, I know that.
my team and I are really good at what we do. Why can't you just let me help you?
no, you can't ask that. I can help you.
I'm not doing this for me. I'm doing this for you, because I cannot let him hurt you, because if he knew, he would
please don't cry.
I get it. I get it, ok? This is--this is how it has to be.
I understand.
are you still there?
Yes. I'm still here.
and, yes, this is how it has to be, for today, at least.
OK.
well, guess I'll talk to you next Sunday.
Bye.
Bye. Love you.
your life is about to end.
you will all die.
in your remaining time on earth, how do you want to live?
as a bright and shining star?
or as a lost soul passing time?
do you want to live in darkness or reveal your magnificent light?!
today you will all be reborn as your true selves.
we are all born with a unique gift.
and your only job here on earth- Your only job- Is to share that gift.
only then, only when we have shed our magnificent light on this world, will we experience real purpose, real fulfillment, and real joy.
let me tell you something about myself.
I spent 12 years of my adult life absolutely miserable because I did not use my gift.
how many of you are living false lives?
maybe you're an accountant.
but somewhere in the dark recesses of your mind, there's a tickle.
and that tickle is a reminder of your gift.
maybe it's a love for painting.
a love that you have had since before you could even talk.
isn't that right, cynthia strobl?
you could be the next picasso.
why have you deprived the world of your gift?
and what about you, ralph pritchard?
do you really want to listen to your insufferable boss another day, or are you ready to start that business you've been dreaming of?
isn't it time for you to unveil your gift and take action?!
right here, right now, that's what we're gonna do.
let's get started!
I still can't believe this.
I never, not in a million years, thought I'd ever get to meet you in person.
and then you called my name and - Cynthia.
the pleasure has been all mine.
now do me a favor.
go out into the world and show them your gift.
Oh, I will. I promise you.
goodbye, cynthia.
that was the last one-on-one, barry.
there's some more folks waiting for autographs.
not now. I need my private time.
when will you be back?
OK. Whatever you want, barry.
sorry, folks, uh, Mr. Flynn is late for a meeting.
so take that first step now.
be ready for resistance.
others will try to stop you.
don't let them.
don't permit them to discourage you.
don't allow them to stand in your way.
tell them to trust you and glorious things will come.
Oh, my god, what are you
Derek, would you do me a favor and say a few words at the shindig?
the honor of your presence has been requested
this is from the british embassy.
Garcia, do you mind?
I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me.
I saw the fancy invitation and I couldn't help myself.
we never get glamour here.
it's like shoeboxes to a hoarder.
well, you can just forget about it.
Why? - 'cause I'm not going.
but isn't jason an old friend of yours?
I've heard his name before.
and who's gonna give the speech if you don't?
I don't know, but it's not going to be me.
we love the british, remember?
can we just drop this?
I can go with you.
nobody is going.
I'll wear my contacts.
What'd I say?
who do I wear my contacts for?
two people have been brutally stabbed in seattle in the last two days.
Lincoln bell, 28, he was found on friday night.
and then cynthia strobl, 42, her body was found last night.
both of them were killed in their own apartments.
police are sure it's the same killer?
Yes, because the same message was left behind.
hear your evil, see your evil.
isn't the phrase supposed to be "see no evil, hear no evil"?
Yeah, it certainly changes the meaning, which is supposed to be about remaining virtuous even when you're surrounded by evil.
well, the question is, did the killer just get the phrase wrong, or was he trying to send a completely different message?
the killer could have been a non-native-english speaker.
but this syntax doesn't help identify his first language.
and the other question is, who is this message for?
is it a taunt to the police?
it could be used to justify the murders.
you know, if you take the words literally, if sounds like he's speaking directly to the victims.
was the message written with the victims' blood?
the lab results aren't back yet.
are there any witnesses?
it doesn't look that way.
which means the entry to the apartments was planned and methodical, but the actually killings seem chaotic and disorganized.
maybe the unsub knew them and took the time to plan his break-in, but once he got close, his rage took over and he snapped.
you know, one thing's for sure.
with at least 30 stab wounds to each victim, this unsub sure has a lot of anger.
we need more answers.
let's head to seattle.
Oh my god would you a great deal of talent is lost to the world for the want of a little courage."Sydney smith.
there's doesn't seem to be a connection between the two victims.
different gender, race, age.
and they lived in different parts of the city.
Yeah. Lincoln bell worked in ticket sales at el portal auditorium for the last 3 years.
Cynthia strobl was an accountant.
she moved to seattle a year ago.
it's unlikely they would have ever crossed paths.
unless cynthia bought a ticket from him at one point.
according to his mother, lincoln's dream was to be an architect.
if he wasn't working, he was studying.
and cynthia liked big band music and lectures at the museum, so the one thing they did have in common was very low-risk lifestyles.
OK, I've confirmed that cynthia lived in a security complex, the kind you need a special key fob to get in.
and lincoln was living in a studio apartment at the top floor of a 6-story walkup.
so the unsub had the intelligence and the patience to get past the security entrance.
he either used a ruse or he blended in with the other residents.
and he had to be in good physical shape to kill lincoln bell.
so, he bypassed easier victims and potential witnesses to commit these murders.
he was mission oriented.
someone went out of their way to target these two people.
Yeah, look at these crime scene photos.
there's not a hint of remorse.
this unsub was determined and relentless, like he couldn't kill these victims enough.
and the different typology means they weren't surrogates for anyone.
so each victim probably did something separately to incite the unsub's rage.
but it must have been the same trigger that set him off, because the murders were so similar.
so, they had something in common outside of low-risk lifestyles.
we need a point of convergence, either a person or a place between the unsub and these two victims.
cause of death was massive hemorrhage.
both the carotid and the femoral arteries were severed, in addition to the other stab wounds.
there's no signs of any other injuries or of sexual assault.
were the arteries cut first?
it's hard to say, but it's very likely.
the first victim, lincoln bell, he had the same targeted lacerations to those arteries.
the other stab wounds, they seem more random.
so the unsub knew the best way to kill them, but he stabbed them multiple times afterwards to express his rage.
there's also something else that's unusual.
these stab wounds have a curvature to them.
they weren't made with an ordinary straight blade.
what sort of knife did he use?
based on my measurements, they were curved, sort of like a half circle.
like a mezzaluna.
does a mezzaluna look like this?
not exactly.
the knife that made these wounds probably had a vertical handle at least 6 inches long in order to get the leverage for the depth.
you know, it looks like a ceremonial weapon of some sort.
I agree.
these killings could be sacrificial.
agent hotchner.
Yes, sir.
detective harrison chen.
thanks for coming out.
this is agent blake.
pleasure.
lab results are back.
it's not blood on the walls.
killer used a red paint that's widely available in hardware stores.
paint belong to the victim?
nothing turned up in our initial search, so...
if the unsub brought the paint with him, that means the message was also premeditated.
it could be a forensic countermeasure, like the messages in the macdonald case.
