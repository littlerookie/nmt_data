I have to say, I had my doubts...
but my daughter has managed to overcome them.
she was determined to make this marriage happen, and here we all are.
Shawn, she couldn't have picked a better partner.
I'm proud to call you my son.
Cheers.
Cheers. - Cheers.
So...where you going on your honeymoon?
well, we haven't really figured that out yet.
if you'll all please excuse me...
stay.
you keep charming your in-laws. I'll see what's up.
you saw me die? You're sure?
I killed you, and Richard, I swear to god, it looked like I was enjoying it.
the whole reason that I'm marrying Isabelle is to keep her attached, normal...
that's not what happens. I don't make her more human. She makes me less human.
listen, I have to try something. I have to go. I have to see if it changes anything.
you're going to walk out on the wedding? - Maybe. I don't know.
I'm-- I'm getting out of here, and then I'm going to see what happens.
if you leave now, it's not going to make Isabelle very happy.
it might not be that easy to come back.
I know that, but I have to do it.
just...tell them I'm sick or something. I'm sorry.
just tell them something, okay?
her name was Holly Martins. She was a housewife in Madison Park.
the pool man found her body. - Was there a note?
how many people is this guy targeting?
guys, I figured out what all these corpses have in common.
all the victims had the same mutation?
we did a genetic workup on all three corpses.
every one of them has a slight alteration of the 11th chromosome.
it's called the Starzl Mutation. - That could be a coincidence.
not likely. The Starzl Mutation is extremely rare.
the only documented cases are in the Seattle area.
see, there's two kinds of mutations. Some occur naturally.
you know, something goes wrong when the body is building itself.
others are induced. The genes are changed by external factors.
the Starzl Mutation is induced. - That's right.
starting in 1969, Seattle Presbyterian Hospital used a flawed radiation machine to treat their cancer patients.
the microswitches that controlled the thing weren't working, so the dosages were all off.
how long did this go on? - Just under five years.
once the hospital figured out what they were doing, they tested everyone who had ever been exposed to it.
in some cases, the radiation induced a small mutation. - The Starzl Mutation.
Yeah, they named it after the company that made the bad machine.
and the mutation's replicable.
people who got it passed it on to their kids, which includes... our three victims.
but they were all living normal lives. They were healthy.
just like most mutations, you can have it and not even know.
after everything went public, the lawyers came out to play. There was a class-action lawsuit.
Seattle Presbyterian paid a huge settlement to everyone who was affected by the machine.
they almost went bankrupt.
so Darren Piersahl, who's supposed to be dead, is targeting carriers of the Starzl Mutation, which only occurs around Seattle, and has absolutely no effect on its carriers.
okay, but why? - Excellent question.
when you find out, make sure you tell me.
if there was a lawsuit, there's a paper trail.
I bet you that hospital keeps a master list of everyone they paid.
you okay? - Shawn...
you have to stop healing me. - No, you're going to make it, uncle Tommy.
no, Shawn, I'm not.
this is all my fault.
I should never have talked you out of marrying Isabelle.
no, that was my decision, not yours.
I can't help thinking that it didn't have to end this way.
everyone we love is dead.
I'm sorry. The catastrophe is here.
Hey--no, no, no. Hold on, hold on, hold on...
hold on...
No! Let me go. Let me go!
save as many as you can, Shawn.
you're lucky.
until six weeks ago, I hadn't pulled that file in years.
if you'd asked me then, it would have taken me hours to find it.
what happened six weeks ago? - Some guy in a suit showed up.
he had a document with him saying that the military needed the file for, uh, research in the war on terror.
Yeah, there we go. There it is.
that's the master list of everyone we paid in the Starzl case.
this man, can you tell me his name?
yeah...
miles Enright. Why? You know him?
not yet.
there's 123 people here.
123 people we know have the Starzl Mutation.
and the numbers we've been finding on the dead bodies correspond to where they appear on the list.
number 27, Timothy Mccarren.
number 11, Paula Nakata.
and Holly Martins, 92.
so Darren Piersahl, if he's the killer, is working from the same list we're holding.
but the order seems so random.
I mean, is he just killing them as the opportunity arises, or is there some method?
I'll try and find a pattern.
Hey, um... how's Maia been?
she's okay.
she asks about you a lot. - Yeah?
I just checked out Miles Enright.
he's a vice president of research and developmentat Haspelcorp.
you've been ignoring our calls.
I'm busy, Tom. Why don't you go through my assistant?
maybe we can talk next week or so.
it's important, Ryland.
it's about Darren Piersahl, and your company's program to create a division of the U. S. Military with 4400 abilities.
I don't know, Tom. I've been working here less than three months.
I still don't know where the supply closets are, and now you've got me heading up a covert program where I'm injecting promicin into united states soldiers?
six weeks ago, the vice president of research and development acquired a list of everyone with the Starzl Mutation.
miles Enright. Maybe you know him?
sorry. It's a big building. I haven't met everybody yet.
three people are dead.
now, you need to tell us everything you know about Darren Piersahl so we can bring him in before he kills anyone else.
I've never heard of him, and I've certainly never heard of this...
what do you call it? "Starzl Mutation"?
this is your last chance to cooperate before we find Piersahl.
if you help us now, we'll make it look better for your company later, Dennis.
well, how can I help you when I have no idea what you're talking about?
now, if this program existed
and please understand, I'm not saying it does
you seem to think that people would be shocked to know that it's out there.
me, I think they'd be grateful.
I think any good citizen would be thankful that his government was working on this, because you can be damn sure our enemies are.
if everyone would be so happy, why not just tell us about it?
as usual, you have no idea of what the stakes are.
whoever controls promicin has a strategic advantage over the rest of the world.
this is another Manhattan Project, Tom, and they didn't close it down because a couple of technicians got radiation poisoning.
they kept on working, and they were right to do that.
it's made the world a better place.
not that you're admitting that the program exists, right?
what program?
so if I go through with it, if I marry Isabelle, you and I become enemies. I kill you.
if I don't do it...Richard, things are even worse. People are dead. A lot of people.
in the second vision, your uncle said that the catastrophe was here, right?
the place looked like a war zone. What the hell am I supposed to do?
look, you can only deal with the information you have.
in one future, I die.
in another, it sounds like thousands of people, maybe millions, are at risk.
that's no choice at all. - We're talking about your life.
the guy said each vision was one possible future. If you do marry Isabelle...
at least we're going into it with our eyes open. Now that we know what could happen, we can change things.
nothing's inevitable, right?
let's hope not...
because believe me...
I don't want to die.
meet staff Sergeant John Shaffner.
okay, so why are we meeting him?
he was one of six fatalities in the helicopter crash that "killed" Darren Piersahl.
a helicopter that seated only four. - Right.
turns out John Shaffner's family never received his remains either.
you know, there was really a helicopter crash that day in Iraq, but four families got their kids' bodies back, and two didn't, so here's what I'm thinking
you think piersahl and shaffner were recruited into Haspelcorp's training program at the same time.
so they used the crash to fake two deaths, so that Piersahl and Shaffner could disappear into the program with impunity.
so we have a second member of Haspelcorp's program, which is great, but it doesn't get us any closer to Darren Piersahl. Good point.
it doesn't, really. Not until...
you look at Shaffner's dog tags.
this is Shaffner's military serial number.
look familiar?
should it?
27. That's what the note we found on Tim Mccarren said.
that's also where we found his name on the list of people with the Starzl Mutation.
11. That was Paula Nakata's number.
and Holly Martinswas 92 on the list. There is a pattern.
he's picking the order based on his buddy's serial number. Okay, but why?
maybe it's a message, maybe they're doing it together, but if he's consistent, the next victim will be number 38 on the Starzl list.
Alex Messina. - I already checked him out.
he manages a bike store in Madrona.
Yeah, I recognize him. He was in here earlier today.
did he say anything to you? - It was kind of weird, actually.
he asked me if my name was Alex Messina, and he said it like that. You know, the full name?
he wanted to know if I could come out and take a look at his bike.
he needed to replace a part. I told him just to bring it in.
he said he'd come back when we were less busy.
send a tactical team over right away. Thanks.
if Piersahl makes a move, we'll be ready.
it must be from Piersahl.
Hey.
do you like this color?
this place needs to be a little more girly if I'm going to be living here.
Yeah, it looks great. - I think so, too.
I'm glad you're back.
if Piersahl knows we're on to him, he'll change his pattern of attack.
there's about a dozen people we can't find. Let's hope we get to them before Piersahl does.
Yeah, who's asking?
my name is John. John Shaffner.
I was a volunteer in the same program Darren Piersahl was in. The one that drove him crazy.
Yeah, we know who you are.
and we know about the program. - Good.
then you're ready to hear what I have to say.
we were volunteers. All of us.
I still remember the sales pitch.
we'd be the elite, a new type of soldier.
we had to give up our lives, forfeit our identities...
they said it was the only way. The program had to operate in complete secrecy.
when did you start getting the injections? - Right away.
it started slow, but about three weeks ago, they started upping our dosages.
that's when guys started to lose it.
where did they get their promicin?
I don't know, but they seemed to have plenty of it, though.
Darren was the first onen who could do stuff.
an ability.
he killed one of the instructors by mistake. It freaked him out.
you two escaped together?
once we got out, we pretty much went our separate ways.
I had no idea he was going do this.
so he's awol? These murders aren't sanctioned by anyone?
no, Darren's freelancing. That's why they want him back so bad.
he's compromising the program.
our C.O.S, they told us about the Starzl Mutation, they told us it could be a threat, but they never told us to kill anybody.
then what is it? Why does Darren want them dead so badly?
it's got something to do with... babies.
so far, any time a 4400 has a kid with a member of the regular population, their babies are normal.
they don't make promicin. They don't have abilities.
we know. We've been tracking the births.
the Starzl Mutation changes all that.
if a 4400 has a kid with someone who has the mutation...
the baby would be promicin-positive.
they'd have abilities.
how would the military even know that? Have they tried it?
I don't know, but they seem pretty goddamn sure it's true.
I know this is going to sound crazy, but Darren is a victim here, too.
they gave us so many stimulants. They amped us up to kill, and he snapped.
I don't know if he thinks he's on a mission or something, but I know he needs to be stopped.
I'll do whatever I can to help you find him.
so, what do you think you know?
everything, including the Starzl Mutation, and I have to give you credit
if what you say is right, it would explain why the 4400 were sent back in 2004, why they were all brought to Seattle...
this is the only place the 4400 can reproduce and have kids with abilities.
any of this sound familiar?
I think I read the same theory in a supermarket tabloid once.
we know about your enhanced soldier program, Dennis.
we have one of your people.
John Shaffner been showing up for many roll calls lately?
well, as soon as we have Piersahl, we're going public with this, and there's nothing you can do to stop that.
all you can do is make yourself and this company look slightly better by cooperating with our efforts to bring him in.
we want Piersahl's personnel file. Everything you have.
if it's not in my hands in 90 seconds, John Shaffner will be standing in front of a bank of cameras before lunch.
this could be something.
maybe. It reads like some kind of personal statement.
an essay by Piersahl.
Yeah, we had to do those to get in the program.
they wanted us to write about some goal we achieved, something we were proud of.
this is all about a volunteer program that he did. There was a patch of forest that got cleared by a fire.
Piersahl volunteered to renew it so that he could become A...
Darren Piersahl was an eagle scout?
Yeah, he used to talk about those woods all the time.
when we were in the middle of the program, whenever things got really bad, he used to tell me that's where he'd go in his head.
he'd imagine himself there. It calmed him down.
this patch of forest, any chance you know where it is?
maybe you could put your arm around her, Mr. Tyler.
that's great.
the magazine wants to get a shot of the bride and groom.
has anyone seen the groom?
who gave you the key?
your own bodyguard.
you started a war, Richard.
you turned the 4400 into an army, and you launched an attack for no reason!
we didn't have a choice.
it had to be a preemptive strike.
no choice? Look at what you're doing!
look at it!
it has to stop.
Isabelle changed you.
you don't even know who you are anymore.
she didn't change me.
she showed me who I am.
I know myself better than ever, and I know exactly what has to happen here.
don't do this.
Shawn. Sorry to barge in on you. It's just...
they need you down in the garden. Pictures.
are you okay?
I'm fine. I'm just...
a little overwhelmed.
Darren, you out here?
what are you doing here?
Darren, relax, man. It's me, Shaffner.
John. We're friends, remember?
shaff. You came.
that's good. That's good. I need your help.
I'm never going to make it all the way through this list on my own.
Darren, you don't have to finish the list.
it's someone else's agenda. You've got it all mixed up in your head.
come on with me. There's some people I want you to talk to. They can help us.
"they"? Who are "they"?
it's got to stop, man. Please.
come with me.
no.
no. - Wait!
we've got people covering the access road. We'll pin him down.
fan out!
Oh, Jesus. Tom!
I can't see anything!
we lost Shaffner.
Piersahl's dead.
he was on his way out before we even started fighting.
Piersahl had a stab wound in his stomach.
I guess Shaffner didn't go down without a fight.
Yeah, well, they're both gone, and there's no one left to talk about the program.
we still have evidence. We can go after Haspelcorp. Expose everything.
Yeah, but it would've been nice to have a face to put out there.
I mean, now all we have are accusations and a paper trail.
and five dead bodies.
Hey, you guys got to see this.
we are proud to announce the existence of this enhanced soldier program to all the world, but it should not in any way be seen as an offensive maneuver.
we have evidence suggesting that other countries have similar programs.
this is merely a response.
the young men I'm about to introduce to you have been working in secret, and we've made numerous advances.
in time, they'll become the first non-4400s to develop extra-human abilities, and they'll use them in the defense of the united states.
now I'd like to introduce eight heroic young men, all of whom have given so much of themselves to make this breakthrough possible.
Ryland's preempting us.
trotting them out there on stage like they're the first astronauts.
major Jeremy Elwood...
first lieutenant Raymond Garcia, first lieutenant Jeff Rice, First lieutenant Brian Dawson, second lieutenant James Knowlon, second lieutenant Dirk Danoff...
the press conference was a clever move, Dennis.
I have to give credit where it's due.
but this company has five bodies on its hands, and I'm going to make sure everyone knows it.
knows what?
we're not denying anything.
it's unfortunate that one of my men went awol, but he was clearly deranged.
I've got a whole team of doctors standing by to testify to that effect.
you created an assassin.
it's a tragedy, and it's news, I'll admit that, but tomorrow morning, the Piersahl case will be below the fold on every newspaper, and all the headlines will be about our program. That's the way I see it, anyway.
who's feeding you your information?
you knew about the Starzl Mutation before we did. You have a source of promicin for your program.
who is it?
you give me too much credit, Tom. That stuff happens way above my security clearance.
the soldiers you're creating... are you really going to use them to defend the country?
or are you just going to send them after the 4400?
is there a difference?
enjoy your nephew's wedding.
you sure you're ready for this?
you look ready.
let's do this.
hello there.
thank you for coming. Thanks, kids.
thank you for coming, so much. Thank you for being here.
thank you so much for being here. Thank you.
thank you for coming so far. Thank you.
appreciate you coming all this way. Thank you so much.
do you know who I am?
we're not a threat.
we're salvation.
the world will have to deal with us.
do you know who I am?
as soon as I am free, you and the world will know what I know.
my son is in prison.
you're the only one who can get him out.
did you kill me?
kill me?
that's Jordan Collier!
tell them I didn't kill you!
you're going to get married.
I saw it.
did you happen to see who the lucky guy was?
someone just told me that I met the woman that I'm supposed to be with, and I can't ignore it.
he broke up with me!
I've done bad things.
you are the enemy.
tell me what to do.
I'll do anything.
leave the 4400 center and never come back.
they won't be able to hide for long.
Dr. Burkhoff's not exactly inconspicuous.
we are proud to announce the existence of this enhanced soldier program.
in time, they'll become the first non-4400s to develop extrahuman abilities in the defense of the united states.
you have a source of promicin for your program.
who is it?
that stuff happens way above my security clearance.
the soldiers you're creating, are you really going to use them to defend the country, or are you just going to send them after the 4400?
is there a difference?
Mr. Collier, you've been doing quite a bit of press since your...
resurrection?
I suppose some people are calling it that.
and in every interview, you've been making the same statement over and over again
the war for the future will be fought in the past.
exactly...
and by "past, do you mean now?
today?
it's our shared burden, yes.
and this war, it's one between 4400s and the non-4400s?
no.
this is a war between good and evil, and it has already started.
good people, 4400s and non-4400s...
come on, kyle. Dinner's ready.
have already ... -I'll be right there.
made incredible sacrifices, and they know they will be called on to sacrifice even more.
they are among the first to know the cost of this struggle, because, for better or worse, all our lives are different now, profoundly different.
that's what wars do.
they change us.
but the stakes...
the stakes are nothing less than the fate of mankind.
but why does there need to be a war at all?
I've seen the future, and it's a bleak one.
the human race is old, it's sick, it's dying.
what's left of civilization is controlled by a brutal and powerful elite who have effectively shut themselves off in the world's last city while the rest of humanity struggle for survival in the surrounding wasteland.
sounds pretty hopeless.
doesn't it?
but there is hope, there is always hope, and it rests with us.
we can change the future, but we must start now. Today.
everything crucial to the world's survival, its prosperity
the resources of this planet, food, water, energy, the genetic materials of life itself
already, even as I speak, are being gathered up and controlled by a powerful and isolated few.
this must stop.
we must stop it.
our enemies are strong, and they grow stronger daily, and they will go to any lengths to maintain their dominance, to confine us to our current path, a path leading only to disaster, only to the catastrophic future that awaits us.
we must band together to fight this...
this evil amongst us, an evil that would destroy us all.
we won't have another chance.
look, I'm telling you, I don't know what happened.
I'm going over the night bulletins with havemeyer, next thing you know,
I got drool all over my shirt and havemeyer's snoring in my ear.
you're saying the entire night shift just fell asleep?
fell asleep, passed out...
I don't remember.
what the hell is going on?
good question.
I've got an entire building full of agents who can't remember a damn thing.
while they were napping, every member of the Nova group in NTACcustody walked out the front door.
Yeah, walked, ran, flew
no way of knowing, since they erased the security tapes on the way out.
but every 4400 downstairs gets injected with the promicin inhibitor, so none of them could've used their abilities to escape.
they must have had help.
someone on the outside.
a 4400.
no, more than one.
someone to knock our people out, another to disable the security system.
so are we talking sympathizers or members we've never caught?
either way, it looks like someone's putting the Nova group back together.
paul Newbold has the ability to raise or lower body temperature.
she wipes memories.
she can make you forget what you had for breakfast or she can erase your entire life.
then there's my old friend, boyd gelder, who can take over your entire life.
the ultimate impersonator.
any one of these people is capable of wreaking serious havoc.
they've done it before.
we have to assume someone broke them out so they could do it again.
the nova group has a lot of scores to settle...
starting with your nephew.
I called shawn.
the 4400 center's already a fortress, but he'll make sure to kick it up a level.
Dennis Ryland's got to be high on their hit list.
and Alana, and Kyle.
Boyd came after my family before.
go.
I'll send some agents over to watch your house.
agent Baldwin, why won't your son make a statement?
did someone pay him to shoot jordan collier?
did he always know Collier was alive?
so how long are we going to be stuck in here?
a few days, a couple of months?
hopefully not too long.
we caught Boyd Gelder once.
we'll track him down again.
in the meantime, Kyle, you need to stay close to home.
don't go anywhere unless it's absolutely necessary.
though couldn't be too bad.
after all, you could still be in prison.
I could still be living on the run.
compared to that, staying close to home is kind of nice...
and before you know it, you'll be heading back to school.
she has a point, kyle.
did you see those registration forms I left for you?
if you like, I could...
you know, I could run them over to the admissions office.
I'm not sure I'm ready to go back to school.
you want to wait a semester, that's up to you, but I figured, you know, going back to school would help things get back to normal.
dad, have you looked outside?
that's not going to happen.
Kyle, you just...
you just have to be patient.
dad, I know you're trying to help, but jordan collier came back from the dead.
no one's ever going to forget that.
and as long as they remember Jordan Collier, they're going to remember the guy who shot him.
I warned Nina Jarvis.
I told her that NTAC was totally unprepared for the threat posed by these people.
did she listen?
no...
and here's the result.
ntac is literally asleep at their desks while the most dangerous 4400s stroll out the door.
we're talking about the Nova group.
violent terrorists.
this isn't about the 4400.
I'm sure you'll agree that that distinction's become meaningless.
every one of the 4400 has developed an ability.
that means every 4400 is a potential enemy.
my daughter's in the fifth grade.
she isn't anyone's enemy.
children grow up, Diana.
we don't know what the Nova is planning.
but they have targeted you before.
now, NTAC is ready to offer you any protection you might need.
that's very generous, Tom, but if my memory serves me, the Nova group made two attempts on my life while I was under ntac protection.
two unsuccessful attempts.
don't sound so disappointed.
would you come in a moment, please?
this time, I'm arranging for my own security.
hello.
we were just discussing the newest threat posed by the Nova group.
there is no threat.
not while I'm around, anyway.
your uncle...
he actually saw them together?
my daughter and Ryland?
at least now we know where she's been for the last week.
jordan should've talked to us before he made her leave.
it's like he delivered her right to Ryland.
I don't know about that.
if she's the source of Ryland's promicin, that means that she was working with him long before she left the center.
talk to her.
make sure she knows who she's working with.
when my daughter's made up her mind, there's no changing it.
you know that.
I'm sorry, Richard.
all her life,
I've been trying to see something good in Isabelle, some kind of light, something to nurture.
maybe I've just been wasting my time...
because it's never been there.
Hi. I'm home.
I didn't get a chance to get the store.
I thought we could order in a pizza.
don't worry about me.
I already ate.
I can see that.
why won't he call me back?
who?
I left him five messages.
I just want him to know that I forgive him, you know?
it's probably my fault.
probably pushed him away.
sitting here blaming yourself is not helping.
do you think he met someone else?
you need to get up.
take a shower, change your clothes, and let's all go out to dinner.
what if he calls?
answer my cell, okay?
sure.
and if he calls, be nice to him, because when we get back together,
I do not want there to be any weirdness between the two of you.
Hi, honey.
we had a deal.
no video games before dinner.
I needed a break.
from what?
aunt April.
I'm sorry, sweetie.
she hasn't stopped from the second I came home from school.
she keeps asking me if they're going to get back together.
you're going to have to go easy on your aunt April.
she's going through a really rough time.
but you and Ben, you're supposed to be together.
maybe if you told her about what I saw...
somehow I don't think that's going to make her feel better.
she's going to know about you two sooner or later.
I mean...
you are going to invite her to your wedding.
what do you think?
you look remarkable.
I'm impressed.
are we interrupting something?
no, not at all.
is everything okay?
not really.
we just talked to my uncle Tommy.
he told us that...
Isabelle and Dennis Ryland are working together.
I see.
did you hear what I just told you?
kicking isabelle out of here may not have been the best decision.
while isabelle was here, she was a threat.
her alliance with Dennis Ryland simply makes it clear where her loyalty lies, and clarity's a good thing, yes?
but we still have preparations to make around this place, just to be safe.
it's not only Isabelle and Ryland out there.
we also have the Nova group to worry about.
the Nova group is no longer our enemy.
isn't that right?
we don't have a problem with you.
not anymore.
have you met Boyd Gelder?
as you can see, he's quite an impersonator.
what's one of the Nova doing here?
he is a 4400, Shawn.
where else should he be?
besides,
I went to a great deal of trouble to get him and his friends out of NTAC.
jordan, this is crazy.
I put my life on the line trying to protect this place from the Nova group, and now we're the ones that break them out from NTAC?
what were you thinking?
that we have a war to fight.
that Nova is a powerful weapon, which, until now, hs lacked proper guidance.
jordan, they're terrorists.
they kill people.
they did what needed doing.
they chose action over accommodation.
not supporting that choice was a failure, Shawn.
Oh, so I made a mistake by not backing the Nova group?
I'm saying you should've been a leader.
these people are willing to sacrifice themselves for the greater good.
they're the kind of soldiers we need in this fight.
they're one of the biggest reasons why people are scared of us, so if we invite them in here, then we become part of the Nova group, and everything that you've been preachingince you've been back, about cooperation and unity between 4400s and non-4400s, it's never going to happen.
we're running a big risk here, Jordan.
we're playing for big stakes.
if NTAC finds out we were involved in the breakout, it'll be bad.
you sure you covered your tracks here?
they're someplace safe?
along with the 4400s who helped free them.
they won't be found.
no, no, no, no.
just because we're not going to get caught doesn't make this okay.
no, tell me you're not buying into this.
I'm just being realistic.
the fact is, we're more vulnerable than ever.
Isabelle's with Ryland now.
it's only a matter of time before those soldiers of his are out there developing abilities.
jordan is right.
we're playing for big stakes now.
another month?
that's completely unacceptable.
the initial volunteers were showing abilities within days.
that's correct, but as you recall, there were problems.
deaths.
since the Piersahl incident, we've scaled back the pace of the promicin injections.
I never authorized that.
I guaranteed this country the protection of enhanced troops.
I won't be made a liar by you.
increase the dosage.
I'll have another shipment of promicin sent over from Haspelcorp today.
I don't know why you're wasting time building an army.
you won't need one.
you're a very powerful young woman, Isabelle, but you're still one person.
think of it as backup.
if that makes you feel more secure...
but by now, Collier knows we're working together.
he won't wait a month to come after us.
if we give those soldiers the maximum dose of promicin, how long before they develop abilities?
anywhere from two to three days.
make it two.
why wait?
you heard the lady.
I'll be staying on base to monitor your progress.
there he is.
look at you, man.
you look great.
I can't believe you're standing here.
we have to celebrate, or we've got to do something.
Yeah, that sounds good.
first I need to ask a favor of you.
name it.
it's good to see you, Kyle.
I was hoping we could talk.
it's really you, isn't it?
you're alive.
it took a while to believe it myself.
I'm sorry for what I did to you.
there's nothing to be sorry about.
my death had to happen.
I've seen you on TV.
you seem so sure that what we all went through means something.
I wish I could understand it the way you do.
to me, it all seems like a waste.
my death was part of a bigger plan.
I know you've suffered for it, and that was unfair, but everything you did, Kyle, including my assassination, was part of that plan.
you have no idea how important you are.
tell me we can spend the whole night together.
you know, I think that Maia should be there when I tell her.
that way, at least she can explain the whole prediction thing.
so much for afterglow.
please tell me you weren't thinking of April the whole time.
no.
I wasn't.
you're right.
we should tell her.
I should do it.
she should hear it from me.
that'd be like hiding behind you, and I admit, that sounds good right now, but I'd just only hate myself even more.
I just wish I knew what to say.
tell her the truth.
you know?
we didn't plan this.
we didn't even want it...
but it happened.
we fell in love.
isn't it a bit early to be using that word?
what would you call it?
God.
it's true.
two weeks, and I'm in love.
it's a good thing.
I know it is.
I mean, it should be, but...
I'm in love, and I can't enjoy it.
how pathetic is that?
what's all this?
I had a lot of time on my hands.
I thought someone should benefit from it.
not you.
I'm making penne arrabiata.
I bet you he hasn't had it in a while.
Where's Kyle?
he'll be home any minute.
he went out?
after I told him not to?
he drove to northmount.
he wanted to register for some classes.
that's great.
how'd he get past the reporters?
they don't even know he's gone.
I made a pitcher of ice tea and some sandwiches, and I brought it out to them, and I distracted them while Kyle slipped out the back.
we planned the whole thing together.
it was fun.
I'm glad someone had a good day.
I take you didn't have a good day at work?
no.
we talked to the family of every prisoner we lost.
no one's heard or seen anything.
I mean, not that they'd give up their loved ones so easily...
and then there's always the 4400 who broke them out.
excuse me, honey.
we haven't made much headway on that front either.
Kyle's going to be a happy man.
you'd think we would've heard something about a 4400 who can override a state-of-the-art security system, or cut off oxygen to a whole building full of people.
I had a student at the center.
when he first came to school, he had some problems.
teachers and the other children kept having headaches and fainting when he was around.
it turns out that it was something about his ability to change the level of oxygen in the blood.
Alana, this student, what was his name?
you think he had something to do with the prison break?
he's 16, you guys.
his ability matches up to what happened to our agents.
and boyd gelder isn't much older.
now, we've spoken to Michael's father.
he says he hasn't seen his son in a week.
is it possible there's a new Nova cell operating out of the center?
if there were, don't you think they would've come after me by now?
they still might.
we don't know what they're planning.
do you mind if we talk to some of the other students, see what they can tell us about Michael?
talk to whoever you like.
listen, Shawn...
look, I appreciate this.
you know, it really helps to have someone here we can work with.
I hope that doesn't change now that Collier's back.
all right.
michael Lawrence's ability is unique, useful, and he controls it with a great deal of accuracy.
why wouldn't I make use of him?
because he's a 16-year-old kid you just turned into a felon.
Shawn, that boy allowed us to neutralize a building full of ntac agents without hurting anyone.
I think I showed great restraint, given the urgency of our needs.
what needs, jordan?
what is so important that we need to get into bed with the Nova group?
come on.
I ran this place while you were gone.
I think I deserve to know what you're planning.
Ryland's enhanced soldier program.
we're going to destroy it.
destroy how?
with Nova's help, we'll attack the army base where the experiment's conducted, take out the lab, the training facility, and when we find the soldiers getting promicin...
neutralize them.
attack a military installation?
jordan, are you insane?
that's how you sound right now.
I don't care what you think you saw while you were gone.
this is the real world.
jordan, listen to me.
do you know how many people would die?
on both sides.
we have no choice.
once those soldiers develop 4400 abilities...
it'll be too late.
there's a gas station.
it's on a highway.
next to it there's a road sign.
can you read the sign?
I'm trying.
something about a petrified tree stump.
it's the biggest one in the state.
afraid that's all of it.
that's the thing with this remote viewing
I never quite see everything.
that ought to be enough to find them.
the gas and a quart of oil comes to 53 even.
okay.
hope you're going to take some time and visit Newfield's claim to fame.
there's not another stump like it on the whole west coast.
we're just passing through.
if I...
if I go back the way I came, will I find the highway?
Oh, she can help you with that.
he wants to get right back on the highway.
that's easy...
but first,
I think you should visit the Newfield stump.
they have a really nice gift shop there.
the town could sure use your business.
I just follow the sign?
that's right, and there's a nice diner along the way.
all the pies are baked fresh.
sounds good.
we'll check that out.
thank you.
you won't be disappointed.
those pies come in on a truck.
they need the business.
Dr. Burkhoff.
ms. Dorner.
I'm Jordan Collier.
I'm betting this isn't a coincidence.
how's your research coming?
it keeps my nights interesting.
Mr. Collier...
we've made a nice life for ourselves.
this is a good place for us, and we like to think that we make things a little better by being here.
please don't ruin it.
were it up to me, you'd live here happily many years, but right now,
I need your ability and your intellect.
sweetie.
I think it's grilled cheese wednesday.
Where's your aunt April?
please don't be mad.
why would I be mad?
you didn't.
I thought it'd make her feel better, knowing about my vision, that it's not her fault that Ben likes you more.
and did it make her feel better?
not really.
she's in your room.
in here.
you're out of tissues.
there's more under the bathroom sink.
you know...
one of the reasons that I liked Ben in the first place was because I thought, "here's a guy my sister would approve of...finally.
you were right.
this was it.
my one chance to settle down with the right guy...
except it turns out he's your right guy.
God, April...
this whole thing with Ben...
I mean, we never meant for it to happen.
I...
I know that doesn't help much.
I know I'll meet another guy.
I always do.
meeting them, sleeping with them, going to the fetish ball with them...
that's not the problem.
finding one that wants to go to the fetish ball with me year after year...
that's the problem.
Ben was willing to go to the fetish ball with you?
he was considering it.
look, Di...
I wish I could hate you,
I really do, but I'm too busy hating me.
I'm such a loser.
no...
no, you're not.
Yes, I am.
I'm going to live alone and I'm going to die alone, and all I'm ever going to be to anyone is "aunt April, the loser.
Kyle, you got a second?
just getting rid of some old stuff.
come on, dad.
I was nine when I got that.
Yeah, I remember the day.
listen, kyle...
once you go back to school,
I thought I'd float you some cash.
that way, you can get your own place, so can have some privacy, some independence.
I saw Jordan Collier yesterday.
you went to the center?
Why?
I had to see him.
we talked.
he helped me realize some things.
what things?
I'm not going back to college, for one.
dad, just listen to me.
hear me out.
my life, my future, it's tied up with the 4400.
that night on the beach when Shawn was taken, it should've been me.
if he hadn't have pushed me out of that beam of light,
I would've been one of them.
Yeah, but you're not.
Kyle, your life can be whatever you want it to be.
you just have to be willing to move forward.
ever since I woke up from that coma,
I thought I was moving forward, but Jordan helped me realize all I was doing was running away.
he told you that?
he told you not to go to college?
no, dad, he just listened to me.
I figured it out on my own.
so, what do you do now, Kyle?
you put on a blue blazer, become one of his disciples?
give tours of the center, answer phones?
maybe.
I'm going to do what you do, dad.
I'm going to help the 4400 any way I can.
I'm sorry.
I agree with Jordan on this one, Shawn.
how can you say that?
if we attack that army base, it's like declaring war on the united states government.
maybe so, but it seems to me we have been in an undeclared war with the government ever since we got back.
locking us in quarantine.
shooting us up with the inhibitor.
disappearing any of us they-- they-- they seem threatened by.
all Jordan's doing is bringing the conflict out into the open.
jordan's going to sacrifice thousands of lives.
it's going to be for nothing.
we're going to lose.
if you have another way, something concrete that makes us safer...
I'm willing to listen.
my god.
I didn't think so.
okay, can you give us a hint what this is about?
you said it was urgent.
the Nova members that escaped...
I know what they're planning...
and who their leader is.
okay.
I'm going to need a name.
you must think I'm insane.
only a psychopath would declare war on the U. S.Army.
then we're all in agreement.
I assure you,
I am not crazy.
I'm not planning attack on any government installation.
so you're saying Shawn made all this up?
why would I do that?
tell the truth, okay?
you can't cover this up.
I told you a story, Shawn, to see if you would pass it along.
it was a test...
and I'm afraid you failed.
I've been away from this place for a long time.
in the days ahead,
I will be asking a lot of everyone here.
I needed to know who I could trust...
and who I couldn't.
I'm sorry to embarrass you like this.
it was the only way to be sure.
and what about the breakout at NTA
you had nothing to do with that either?
I did not.
that is a lie.
that's a lie.
I saw Boyd Gelder standing in this office with my own two eyes.
richard was here with me.
he saw him, too.
I don't know what you're talking about, Shawn.
as far as I know, Boyd Gelder has never been here.
so you're saying, in spite of all Collier's denials, this base is still the subject of a possible Nova attack?
it's possible, yes.
and you came all this way to warn me?
I'm touched, Tom.
just doing my job, Dennis.
it's nothing personal.
collier knows you're here, so this place is no longer secure.
your little experiment needs a new home.
I say let them come.
if collier wants a fight, we'll give him one.
she's right, you know.
collier talks a good game
unity, fighting together to save the future...
people actually believe he means it.
it's pathetic.
but an attack will expose the 4400 for what they really are
the enemy.
you see, Tom? I was right all along.
it comes down to survival.
us against them.
you sure you want to be at ground zero for this one, Dennis?
defending the human race?
where else would I be?
we're staying right here.
how did it feel, turning your back on me?
I was just trying to save lives.
yours included.
you know, maybe if you'd told me everything, treated me with a little respect, we could've worked things out, but no, you were too busy manipulating me, like always.
you know, jordan, while you were gone...
I ran this place, and I did a pretty good job of it, too.
now you're back.
you and I, it's like nothing's changed.
you make all the decisions, and I play catch-up.
five steps behind.
used to be 10.
I need you to believe in me.
do you know what I think, Jordan?
I think that this whole messiah thing has gone to your head.
I'm no messiah.
more like...
the guy that tried to free all the slaves?
he surrounded himself with people who believed as he did, who were willing to do anything for their cause, and that kind of devotion can change the world.
they killed John Brown, Jordan.
they killed me, too.
Mr. Ryland.
I was told we wouldn't be seeing you for a while.
we have a security situation.
ntac intelligence has gotten word that Jordan Collier may be planning a move against us.
I want to transfer all the promicin out of Haspelcorp for safekeeping.
I want every vial packed and ready for shipment as soon as possible.
Yes, sir.
give us a hand here.
we've got a lot of crates to move.
I wanted them loaded up as soon as possible.
we'll take it from here.
the military base was never Collier's target.
he wanted to divert us from his real goal.
the promicin.
you had enough stored here to create a whole army of enhanced soldiers.
before Collier's done, you'll wish you had that army for protection.
I wonder what he'll do with all of it.
destroy it.
he doesn't want anyone else to develop abilities.
he wants to keep us weak, so no one can fight back.
sounding a little paranoid, Dennis.
collier's a fanatic, Tom.
he's capable of anything.
you'll see.
so you're saying you want to break up?
I don't want to.
then let's not.
look, I know how bad you feel
I feel bad, too
but I also feel really, really good.
isn't that worth holding on to? Trying, at least?
I'm trying, believe me.
I...
but it's like we're never alone.
there's you, me, and April, and she's the one crying.
Yeah, I think I need to leave.
great.
now April and I are both crying.
no, look, I didn't mean for good.
you can't get rid of me that easily...
but I do have a job to do in london.
it's five days.
it'll give us some time to think things over.
five days?
want to come?
no.
Yes.
I...
just leave.
please.
I'll call you as soon as I get back, okay?
just...
just so you know...
even if Maia never made any prediction...
I'd still think we're meant for each other.
I've been trying to reach you.
what is it? What's wrong?
Kyle's leaving.
what?
he's upstairs packing.
Kyle, what are you doing?
I'm glad you're home.
I would've hated to leave without saying goodbye.
where are you going?
did Collier send that limo?
I got a job.
I'm going to travel around the country for a little while, hold these workshops at the 4400 centers, talk about my life, everything that's happened to me...
spread the word.
Kyle, can't you take a couple of days?
you know, think this obout this.
there's nothing to talk about.
I'm going to miss you, dad, but I've got to do this.
I just got you home.
you said I should move forward.
that's what I'm doing.
be happy for me.
I'm trying, Kyle.
I'm really trying.
I got to get going.
I really got to get going.
here...
let me help you.
Thanks, dad.
it's beautiful.
isn't it.
they're going to be looking for it.
we've got to get rid of it, soon.
I don't understand.
why take it at all?
why not just destroy it there?
we're not going to destroy it.
all right, I'll ask the question.
what are we going to do with 17, 432 units of promicin?
we're going to give it away.
to who?
to everyone.
4400 were taken 4400 were return.
each has a unique ability.
one among them has a message.
anyone can become extraordinary.
the risk is great.
but so are the rewards.
and now there's no turning back.
the world will have to deal with us.
these shots are free.
give them to anyone who wants them, but be careful to explain the risks.
handing out promicin like candy changes everything, Shawn.
nobody can predict what's going to happen once people everywhere start developing abilities.
how's it going, sibling?
april Skouris, black sheep of the family.
you don't really know this girl at all, do you?
the whole time we were planning our wedding, you were working with Ryland, betraying me.
Where's the promicin?
get your hands off of me.
he's stable. That's the good news.
but he hasn't regained consciousness.
they don't know when he will.
I have a job offer in Spain.
if you come with me.
if Collier's right, if moving into this new world of his means more upheaval in the here and now,
I'm going to find myself a place where I can live at peace with my daughter as long as I can.
alana's picture's gone out to every hospital and law enforcement agency in the country.
nobody's seen her, tom.
I'm sorry.
Hey, Kyle!
you ready? Come on, buddy.
it's starting soon.
you think I'd be late for this?
I'm as psyched as you are, dad.
good, let's do it, then.
I saved you some seats.
sorry.
Hey, Tom.
Hey, Maia.
you look nice. - Thank you.
you said you'd be late, so I held things up for you.
Yeah.
hey... - hey, guys.
Hey, how are you doing?
Hey, how are you?
Hi, Tess.
Hi, honey. - Good to see you.
Kevin... - How are you?
I thought you'd never make it.
well, I had a little help.
thank you, thank you.
I appreciate the applause, even though I know who it's really for.
we're all here to give thanks to one man, a man who took a dark and dangerous world and healed it.
a man who eliminated disease and war and changed our ideas of what it is to be a human being.
he made 4400 abilities available to everyone, and all of our lives are better for it.
some call him a savior, some call him a messiah.
ladies and gentlemen,Mr. Jordan Collier.
today, this morning, here and everywhere, it is good to be alive!
united like humanity has never been united.
through promicin, the gift I brought you, and that you accepted.
together, we have created heaven on earth, a time of joy, endless joy, that we share as one.
and for that, I say let us bow our heads in thanks.
it's okay.
it was a dream.
you were dreaming...again.
what was it about this time?
I, uh...
I handed out the promicin.
I stopped the catastrophe.
well, it was the right thing to do.
we saved the future from...
I know what kind of world I prevented.
but is the world I created any better?
San Sebastian, Spain more, please.
that is so disgusting.
you said you wouldn't do that in front of me anymore.
it's gross.
it's not disgusting.
it's love, and one day, you'll understand.
so, mommy, when are you going to tell us?
tell us what?
mommy got the job offer.
the job with the European Union came through?
she'll be advising them on all things 4400.
they said we could live anywhere in the E. U.
the benefit package is unbelievable.
Wow. Okay.
is there anything the job doesn't come with?
Yeah, a gun, which makes it just about perfect.
if I take this, it means that we're not just on vacation anymore.
I mean, we have to settle down somewhere.
so how about it?
is everyone ready to put down some roots?
Hey, dad.
when did you get back into town?
why didn't you call me?
honestly? Um...
the way things left off, I wasn't sure you wanted to hear from me.
Kyle, you said you wanted some distance.
I was trying to respect that, but you should know you...you can talk to me any time.
I start this new job tomorrow.
it's a legal aid thing helping out the 4400.
I was going to get a hotel, you know, while I looked for an apartment, but it just seemed kind of stupid you being here all by yourself, you know?
still no word on Alana?
no.
I could use some company.
Yeah.
I'm sorry she's gone, dad.
I really liked her.
she loved you.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I,uh...
I keep hoping that I'll come home some day, and she's just going to be here.
I'm going to go unpack. Is that all right?
I want to go see Shawn later.
welcome home.
Thanks.
the good news is I'm not dead.
I took the shot three days ago and I'm still here.
the bad news?
I can't blow things up with my mind, or fly, or do anything differently at all.
I'm still just me.
Graham. A. K.A. No one.
okay, so, I kind of want to go to the prom with jeff.
Amber! - I didn't know, but
Amber... - such a stupid geek.
all right, guys, get in here.
time to pick teams.
come on, move it.
line up over here, guys.
come on, Mike! You're always the last one.
hurry up!
I'll take...
I want Graham.
me?
wait a minute.
I'm taking Graham.
guys, come on. Stop messing with me.
everyone knows I suck at basketball.
listen up.
if Graham doesn't want to shoot hoops, then hoops is off the menu.
so how about it, Graham?
what do you want to play?
you're serious?
Absolutely.
we can play whatever you want.
just tell us what to do.
um, thumb wrestling?
all right, thumb wrestling it is.
pair up!
you two over here, come on, come on, move it!
you two guys, over here.
Mike, you and Billy over here.
what's going on?
say hello to the new head of ntac.
I don't get it.
the woman doesn't have a single day of law enforcement experience.
she works in a think tank for a few years, so they give her a gun and a badge and tell her to go play sheriff?
Yeah, well, I heard she managed the flow of refugees after the hurricanes in Texas, and did a good job of it, too.
she's a political appointment.
probably smiled at the right person at some cocktail party, so they passed over all the qualified people.
Oh, and, Tom, she said she wanted to see you as soon as you got in.
Hi. I'm-- - Tom Baldwin. I know.
does that look straight to you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.
it looks good.
you must like subtitles.
have you ever seen La Dolce Vita?
honestly? No. No.
I'm getting the distinct impression no one else around here has either, but that's okay.
you should check it out, though.
okay, I'll do that.
relax, Tom.
it's not homework.
please, come and sit down.
there's something I want you to see.
something to get us off on the right foot.
open it.
it's interesting.
you do know I'm not cleared to read this?
Oh, of course, but I've read your file.
you don't seem like the kind of agent who'd let that bother you.
go ahead.
I won't tell if you won't.
this is all about Isabelle Tyler.
why are you showing me this?
she can have visitors now.
I figured you might want to see her.
I know you've been looking for Alana Mareva for three months.
I also know that you're at a dead end.
you must have considered the possibility that she was abducted again.
of course. People don't just fall off the edge of the planet.
Isabelle Tyler is the one person alive with a tangible connection to the future.
if they did take Alana, maybe Isabelle will be able to tell you something.
you sure this isn't going to blow back on you?
I mean, you just started. I don't want to get you in trouble.
if I succeed in this job, if I bring in Jordan Collier, no one's going to mind if a few rules are broken along the way, and if I don't, no amount of toeing the line will save me.
I appreciate this. Thanks.
you know those posters.
you have a taste for foreign films, people think you're some kind of intellectual or a radical.
the truth is, I just like the movies.
are you sure you don't like that they make people uncomfortable?
maybe that, too.
Hey, buddy.
can you hear me?
hey...
my dad says when I was in a coma, he used to talk to me all the time.
I don't remember any of it, but who knows?
maybe it helped.
I wish there was something I could do for you.
I tried.
three months ago, I took the shot.
I was so scared, but I just did it anyway.
I was thinking maybe I could wake you up.
same as you did for me.
want to hear the punch line?
nothing happened.
three months, no ability.
nothing. I mean, nothing.
nothing's changed at all, really.
that's weird, huh?
I tried.
I'm sorry.
Hello?
excuse me.
are you lost?
help me. Help me.
there are dead people everywhere I go.
they hate me.
I made them dead.
we made them dead.
Tess, we gave them a choice.
we didn't force the shots on anyone.
I want you to take your medication. All right?
it'll make you feel better.
come on, come on.
she'll calm down once she's had her pills.
is that your medical opinion?
Tess is schizophrenic.
the strain of hiding out, the guilt over what we did, she can't handle it.
it's caused a break.
she needs medical care beyond what we can provide.
till I find a doctor sympathetic to us, you'll have to administer her medications yourself.
well, you just remember, Tess' ability is what keeps you safe.
if it wasn't for her, you'd have been arrested a long time ago.
and I promise you, I don't care if the fate of the world is at stake,
I will not sacrifice Tess to you or your cause.
our cause, Kevin.
ours.
Hey, guys. What's up?
all of us were talking, and we just want you to know we're with you.
all of us.
we believe.
in what? - In you.
we're not the only ones.
we brought someone.
Oh, my god.
what are you doing here?
I came to be with you.
what the hell is going?
whoa. Amber, wait a minute.
you know those shots you always hear about on the news?
I took them.
I think maybe it's screwing you guys up.
no, Graham, it's you.
we want to be close to you.
we want to be close to the light.
what light? - The one that shines out of you.
I didn't see it until today, but now I do.
it's beautiful.
you're beautiful.
are you sure you want to do this?
they told you to kill me.
you didn't do it.
did you ever think maybe that's why your girlfriend's gone?
it's your punishment?
is that something you think, or is that something you know?
how's Shawn?
any change?
no. He's in a regular hospital now.
long-term care.
what about my father?
has anybody heard from him?
no, he's on our list, and we'll find him.
now, Isabelle, if you know anything about Nlana, please tell me.
just tell me, please!
you want to have hope, don't you?
you want to believe she's coming back.
of course.
then you don't want to know what I know.
I'm sorry, Tom.
I really am, but they used you.
the same way they used me.
Hola?
Hey, Diana.
it's me, Marco.
are are you having a good time in Spain?
Yeah, hey, Marco!
Yeah, no, everything's good.
are you okay?
Yeah. Yeah, I-I'm good.
uh, something came up, though.
a couple days ago, some agents raided an apartment.
there was a lot of promicin there.
one of the guys they brought in gave up a whole bunch of names.
you know, people they'd given syringes to?
okay, so what is it you want to tell me, Marco?
Uh...one of the names was April Skouris.
my sister took the shots?
the guy didn't know if she actually injected them, but she definitely had them.
have you heard from her?
no, I-I haven't heard from her in months.
she didn't call me on my birthday, but I figured, April, you know?
Yeah, I remember.
look, I'm sorry, I just...
you know, I thought you should know.
I appreciate it.
Thanks. Bye.
you're going back to Seattle, aren't you?
that used to be a statue of our namesake.
last night, a dozen students tore it down and put that thing up.
when we asked them why, they said it was a statue of Graham Holt.
who's Graham Holt?
he's a junior. C student.
basically unremarkable in every way.
so this kid pulls a prank, and you call ntac?
I called ntac because I think maybe this kid took some of those shots.
I mean, what's going on around here isn't normal.
the posters, the statue.
last night, our valedictorian revised her application essay to Stanford.
she read it to her guidance counselor this morning.
it's 500 words on how Graham Holt is the most important spiritual leader since the time of Christ.
I called him into my office earlier this morning.
he claims to have no idea about what's going on.
well, I think we need to meet this Graham Holt.
from now on, everyone's favorite band is TV on the radio.
got that? Tv on the radio.
they're the best band out there.
excuse me. Excuse me. Graham?
these gentlemen would like to have a word with you.
I'm agent Baldwin. This is agent Garrity. We work at ntac.
okay. We're going to have to ask you to come with us.
we're going to bring you in to ntac and we're going to give you a test to see if you're promicin positive.
Why? - Look around you, Graham.
I think you know why. - Do I have a choice?
you have a choice whether or not you do it in handcuffs.
if you haven't taken the shot, you don't have anything to worry about. Now, come on.
you're sitting in my spot.
I didn't realize these benches were assigned.
well, they are. Literally.
I'm in my first year at the institute.
art and design?
I'm supposed to do a charcoal sketch of a view from the park every day for seven days.
you're in my spot.
okay. I'll move.
I'll move. - Thanks, Kyle. I appreciate that.
how do you know my name?
honestly?
I recognized you as soon as I walk up.
I read a lot about the 4400.
which means I read a lot about you.
so I guess you know all about me and Jordan Collier, huh?
Yeah, I do. Kind of hard to avoid.
well, you know it wasn't me who shot him, right? Not really me.
I didn't really believe it was you.
you didn't look like a killer to me.
well, I guess that's a kind of compliment. Thank you.
I have to get back to work, but good luck with your assignment.
maybe I'll see you around.
I'll be here for the next seven days.
seems to me there's a very simple explanation for what's going on at Stevenson High.
this kid, Graham, took the promicin shot, and now everyone who meets him thinks he's god.
come on, come on.
I've heard you tend to move directly to the point, Marco, but really, god?
well, obviously, he's not the god.
at best, he's a god, a minor deity.
whatever. These kids are building effigies of him.
they're willing to fight us to protect him.
sounds like worship to me.
you two guys are lucky you weren't turned.
it seems like you only need a couple minutes around Graham before you find religion.
maybe they're unlucky.
absolute devotion is a rarity in the modern age.
it might bring a real sense of purpose to life. A clarity.
guys, what do we do with this kid?
we go back with more people. We isolate him, hope the effects wear off.
but I'd do it fast.
it sounds like Graham's pretty much focused on being king of the school.
I mean, imagine what happens if he learns to think a little more ambitiously.
what the hell is that?
are you here to give yourselves body and soul to Graham Holt?
not exactly.
then I suggest you leave.
these streets are his.
we'll defend them with our lives.
just take your men around that way.
this is me, Graham. What do you want?
I want you to end this, Graham.
if you don't come out of there, these people are going to get hurt.
that what you want? - No, of course not.
these people are just trying to protect me.
you're forcing them to be here.
you've taken away their free will. Their lives are in your hands.
I understand.
I don't want anything bad to happen to them, either, but you just need to give me some time.
like, a night to figure this out. Okay? One night.
I just bought us some time.
we've got planning to do.
hey...
try not to look so gloomy, okay?
and who knows?
she might not even be able to get into Seattle.
she'd be right back here in a couple hours.
she's never coming back here.
she said she is, Maia, and I really need to believe that.
so, Kyle, tell me, you ever go visit your cousin, Shawn?
hasn't been much in the paper about him lately.
is he getting any better? - No, he's not, which is weird, because the doctors say there's no reason why he shouldn't be awake.
his brain's active, his vital signs are okay.
that's so sad. He seemed like a really good guy.
everyone's just given up.
settling in for the long haul.
didn't I read something about the promicin in his system?
the doctors think it's all out of whack?
that's right. They think that's why he ,his body shut down, but I don't think that made it into the papers.
well, it must have.
how else would I know about it?
okay, I know I'm not a doctor, but maybe someone should try injecting him with a big old dose of promicin.
it'd be like giving him a jump start, right?
Shawn's a 4400. Probably wouldn't hurt him.
Yeah, I've thought about that.
the doctors won't even consider it. Promicin is seriously illegal.
too bad you can't get your hands on any.
you might be the only person in his life who cares enough to actually take a shot at waking him up.
they've just been standing here staring at us for hours.
don't they ever have to use the bathroom?
head's up.
don't shoot! My name's Graham Holt. I want to surrender.
it's about time.
hands up. Keep your hands up.
all right, on your knees.
easy...
it's not him! It's not Holt! - Don't shoot!
my name's Graham Holt. - On your knees!
I want to surrender. - Now! On your knees!
don't shoot!
I'm Graham Holt-- I'm Graham Holt.
I'm Graham Holt!
I'm Graham Holt!
I'm Graham Holt!
I'm Graham Holt!
don't fight me. Join me.
we are experiencing technical difficulties PLEASE STAND BY.
Hey, everyone. My name's Graham Holt.
I just wanted to say, you have nothing to be afraid of.
believing in me doesn't make you a different person.
you'll still love your family.
you'll still wake up in the morning and go do whatever it is you do.
you'll just have more purpose, and everyone will believe exactly what you do, and you'll believe what they do.
it's all going to be very cool.
I promise. - She's gone.
just open up your hearts and let me in. - She must have left in the middle of the night.
did you hear me? She's gone.
I just wanted to say- - Jordan!
what are you doing?
we have to find her before someone picks her up.
you'll have to go without me.
what do you mean,"go without you"? This is Tess. You owe her.
I did not give out promicin to the world to have it unite under a 16-year-old boy. ...
he has to be stopped.
it's all going to be very cool, I promise.
I see.
you're having Messiah envy.
how are you going to stop him, Jordan?
anybody who gets near that kid winds up praying to him.
what makes you any different?
and even if you could get close to him, what do you expect to happen?
a miracle?
I guess I need one, don't I? ...
you'll just have more purpose, and everyone will believe exactly what you do, and you'll believe what they do.
it's all going to be very cool, I promise.
are you guys nuts? I'm an ntac agent!
we're on the same side!
Hey, come on, come on!
guys, guys- - hey!
they're arresting everybody at ntac.
what are you talking about? Why?
our orders are to bring you all downtown, sir.
Graham wants to bring ntac into the fold.
fine. Fine. Sounds good.
what choice do we have, huh?
are you okay? - Yeah.
Graham converted a couple of police stations.
the cops are arresting people, bringing them to him by the hundreds.
I'm the king of Seattle!
Kyle, why aren't you picking up the phone?
I told you it's dangerous outside right now. Now, call me back.
still no word from your son? - No.
what did D. C.say? - Nothing good.
they're already talking acceptable losses, air strikes, sending an army division into the city.
they're going to invade an American city? Sounds a lot like civil war to me.
I know best I could do was buy us a couple hours. - To do what?
we have to gather everyone from ntac that hasn't been converted, make our way downtown, fight our way downtown if we have to.
we'll try and get close to Graham.
we'll see if we can get to him before he gets to us.
Oh, my god. Shawn! What happened?
I don't know. He was just lying there and he started convulsing.
Oh, my god...
Hey, come on. Hey, Shawn. Hey...
Hey, it's us. It's Kyle.
say something if you're okay. Come on.
mom?
how did I get here?
Collier...you did the right thing coming to me.
it would have been a shame if I had to track you down.
seems the world is falling at your feet.
I wanted to see why.
don't worry.
soon, it's all going to make perfect sense to you.
no.
I gave you promicin.
I can take it away.
what did you do to me?
I made you ordinary.
shoot him! Shoot him now!
the world doesn't need you anymore.
it has me.
get on with your lives.
Graham shouldn't have converted so many cops.
one of his former followers arrested him right there, on the steps of the courthouse.
and there's no trace of promicin in his system? Nothing?
no, he's just a high school kid with a lot to answer for.
I guess we can all stop wondering if Collier has an ability.
he can neutralize promicin. - I don't get it.
Shawn never said anything about Collier doing that to one of the original 4400.
maybe it doesn't work on them.
maybe he can only do it to the extra crispies.
extra crispies, you know, like, not the original recipe 4400?
people who took the promicin shot and then got an ability.
so Collier walked into what was essentially an occupied Seattle, laid hands on this kid, and solved a problem that had the entire U. S.Government in a panic.
if I was sitting at home, watching this story on the 6: 00 news, you want to know what I'd be thinking?
people were praying to the wrong guy.
collier just posted a message on the internet.
we all had a scare today.
we'll have others before we're done.
we...We're walking a difficult and a dangerous path, but we're walking it together.
whether you've chosen to join me or not, we're all, every one of us, making history now.
I got a call from the warden at Kurland prison.
there's a message for you from Isabelle Tyler.
that's it? The Powell museum?
she said your answer's there, and you'll know it when you see it.
the time for sitting on the fence is over.
the time for greatness is now.
each of you has a role to play.
your only choice is whether you accept it or have it thrust upon you.
promicin is out there.
people are gaining abilities, and nothing can be done about that...
I'm sorry, sir. There's no student named Cassie Dunleavy registered at this school.
she said she's a student here. I really need to talk to her.
I can't find her anywhere.
maybe she didn't give you her real name. Have you thought of that?
the genie will not go back into the bottle.
I know it's tempting to think that we can hold on to the past, to everything that's safe and easy, but we cannot, and safe and easy are what set us on the path to catastrophe in the first place.
the chains of comfort are what keep us from reaching for a better world.
this new era, it's not coming, it's not on the way, it's here, and we are now separated from our old lives by a gulf that can never again be bridged.
so all of you out there need to ask yourself one thing, are you ready?
4400 were return.
each has a unique ability.
one among them has a message.
anyone can become extraordinary.
the risk is great.
but so are the rewards.
and now there's no turning back.
the world will have to deal with us.
these shots are free.
give them to anyone who wants them, but be careful to explain the risks.
I couldn't save her.
there are no guarantees.
there never are.
maybe I'll see you around.
you ever go visit your cousin, Shawn?
is he getting any better?
maybe someone should try injecting him with a big old dose of promicin.
it'd be like giving him a jump start, right?
you know, ever since the 4400 came back, it's been one sacrifice after another.
it has to stop.
it worked, right?
I-I'm not dead.
not this time, no.
next time, you might not be so fortunate.
they told you to kill me.
you didn't do it.
you ever think maybe that's why your girlfriend is gone?
I know you've been looking for Alana for three months.
you must have considered the possibility that she was abducted again.
wood Haven Insurance Group 7: 54 am
I'm sorry, I...
I didn't see you there.
excuse me, how did you get in here?
okay, I don't understand
okay, this is too weird. I'm getting off.
excuse me. I need to get out of here.
I need to get out of here.
no, please...
no...please, no!
no, I can't handle tight spaces!
I can't breathe!
I got to get out of here!
get me out of here, please, I can't breathe!
help me, I can't breathe!
no, I can't breathe! I can't breathe!
help me, please, I can't...
I can't...
Jefferson Street 8: 14 am
leave me alone!
he's...he's going to kill me!
No!
leave me alone!
stop, please!
leave me alone!
Oh, god!
see if he's got a medical alert bracelet.
hey... - hello, tom.
I heard about your sister. I figured you might be showing up.
Yeah.
Ben and Maia with you?
no, they're in Spain, which is where I'll be as soon as I figure out what happened to April.
you working any leads?
no one's seen or spoken to her in months.
I don't even know if she's alive or dead.
just because she got her hands on a promicin shot doesn't mean she took it.
no, this is April we're talking about.
if she got the shot, she took it.
Yeah, look, if there's anything I can do, anything you need, you just say the word.
actually, I was hoping you could tell me a little bit about your new boss.
she's young, inexperienced, think-tank smart.
spends a lot of time in the theory room. Why?
I was thinking about asking for temporary reinstatement.
just hoping access to ntac's resources will speed up my search.
I'm not sure she'll go for the temporary assignment kind of thing.
then I guess I'll just have to tell her that I'm back for good.
so you're going to lie?
this is my sister. I'll do whatever it takes.
okay, I'm so sorry for dumping all this on you.
because I know you've got other things on your mind.
is there any news on Alana?
I have to admit that the resemblance is striking, and there's nothing about her in any of these art books?
all I know is that from June to September, 1885, Claude Pierrot painted six portraits of a woman named Alana.
who she was, what happened to her afterwards, is all a blank, but that...
that's her, Diana, that's Alana.
and you think they sent her back into the past as some kind of punishment for you not killing Isabelle?
I think the future gave her to me and the future took her away.
I guess there's no way of ever finding out.
maybe there is.
I know how to contact the future. I've done it before.
Oh, no, please tell me you're not thinking of doing anything stupid.
Oh, tom...
I will always be grateful for you for getting Maia back, but you attempted suicide.
the only reason they saved you last time was because they needed you.
now, that's not the case this time.
it's been three months, Diana.
I don't know what else to do.
wherever Alana is, whatever happened to her, she does not want you dead.
don't let them get me!
please, they're going to kill me!
what you're looking at is a highly elevated fear response.
in Mr. Kopelow's case, it's a fear of clowns.
but to have that kind of reaction, doesn't there need to be,you know, actual clowns?
that's what makes these cases so unusual.
there's no external stimuli present.
how many cases are we talking about?
eight in the last two hours, which is why I called you.
see, we all have things that we're afraid of, insects, heights, but we learn how to cope with them.
in these people, those coping mechanisms are turned off.
they've seen their worst fears come to life.
and you think a 4400 ability's behind this?
someone or something is turning their preexisting fears into unmanageable phobias.
excuse me.
well, eight cases in two hours.
I'd say someone's been pretty busy, huh?
for all we know, they're just getting started.
columbia Fidelity Bank 10: 20 am u think one of my employees drove those people crazy?
look, all we know is that five of our eight victims had receipts from your branch's ATM.
according to the transaction slips, they all used the machine some time between 7: 12 and 7: 28 this morning.
the bank isn't even open then.
that means no one on my staff is responsible, right?
we're still going to need everyone to submit to a promicin test, just to be sure.
look at this.
Max Kopelow. - Yup and look who's right behind him in line. Jacqui Glendon.
our claustrophobia victim.
there's no audio, but looks like there's some kind of commotion just outside of camera range right there.
what do you think?
we'll need a list of everyone who used that ATM this morning.
I can get you that.
great.
Hey, sleeping beauty. - Hey...
how does it feel to be awake?
it feels pretty good.
you know they're kicking me out of here today.
you going home?
that's fantastic.
it'll make those media hounds outside very happy.
I might disappoint them and sneak out the back.
I don't know.
I cannot believe how much catching up I have to do.
so much crazy stuff has happened the last three months.
Acabab change is painful. It comes with a cost.
you're quoting Jordan Collier now?
you say that like it's a bad thing.
I didn't think he'd go through with it, hand out all the promicin?
he knew what would happen.
he knew it would kill all of those people.
Yeah, and I feel bad for those people, but I've seen promicin do some amazing things.
I guess I should be thanking you, huh?
for what?
come on, Kyle.
I overheard the doctors talking.
they said that there was some kind of spike in my promicin level, and that's what woke me up, and it was you and my mom in the room when it happened, and I kind of doubt that my mom could get her hands on a shot.
it had been three months, man.
the doctors weren't sure you were ever going to wake up.
somebody had to try something.
what about your dad? He's going to figure out it was you.
probably.
San Sebastian is one of the most beautiful cities in the world, and that view of the bay at night it's pretty spectacular.
which is why if I dropped everything and moved there with my daughter and boyfriend,I might find it a little hard to give up.
well, it wasn't an easy decision.
no, but knowing the separation was only temporary must have made it easier.
I'm not really sure how long I'll be staying.
it could be quite some time.
at least until you find your sister.
look, Diana, I know you've been trying to track April on your own, and that you've hit a brick wall, but you flash an ntac badge, it's amazing how fast those walls come down.
it's clear what you get out of this arrangement, but what's my win?
me.
I'm your win.
temporary or not, you could use another experienced agent here.
that's pretty much what your former partner, Tom, said.
smart guy. You should listen to him.
let me ask you a question.
have you ever seen La Dolce Vita?
do I look like I watch dubbed movies?
do I?
welcome back, agent Skouris.
I'm being reinstated because I like foreign films?
of course not, but it doesn't hurt your cause.
transferring me? Where?
it's a brand-new facility for people who've developed abilities that the government considers non-threatening.
They're...kept on the inhibitor, but otherwise, it's less like a prison and more like a...an internment camp?
there's an exercise yard, a library that you can use, and, of course, you'll be allowed to interact with the other inmates.
sounds nice.
nicer than this place, anyway.
then we'll arrange for your transfer.
but first, we need you to sign this.
it's a consent form, giving us permission to test your tolerance for promicin.
you want to see if I can get my abilities back?
we want to make absolutely sure that you can't.
the substance that your father injected you with negated your abilities, but before we can move you to another facility, we need to be positive that they're never coming back.
what if they do? What then?
we're prepared to deal with that contingency as well.
this morning when you were in line at the ATM, do you remember seeing this man?
Yeah, I wasn't really paying any attention.
I was on a business call.
does ntac cover your life insurance?
did you notice anything unusual while you were there?
anyone's behavior strike you as odd?
there was this one guy.
I think he was complaining about the line.
how long it was taking.
what did he say exactly?
he was yapping about the bank being too cheap to spring for another ATM.
he's right about that, by the way.
what did he look like?
20-something. I think he was wearing kind of like a baseball cap.
he was just a regular guy.
when do you ever notice people at banks?
unless they're robbing the place, right?
Hey, Tom...
we got a no-show.
thank you.
Mr. Kennedy!
I'm agent Garrity, ntac.
stop!
okay, stairs.
I made up your old room for you. - Okay.
Danny, why don't you take your brother upstairs while I make some lunch?
how does a tuna melt sound?
that's my favorite.
all right...
come on, Troy, talk to us.
why did you attack those people, huh?
you got a problem with Columbia fidelity bank, huh?
or maybe you did it for a laugh.
you think screwing with people's heads is funny?
is that it?
no. Look, I admit I took promicin.
I lost my job, I couldn't pay off my credit cards, my girlfriend dumped me.
I...I was desperate.
I took the shot to make my life better.
better, better. Better how, huh?
by driving a bunch of people crazy?
they're at Abendson psychiatric hospital, writhing around in strait-jackets.
it wasn't me, I swear.
my ability's harmless.
I play music.
I pick up any instrument, and I'm like a virtuoso.
Really?
well, I'll go home and get my clarinet.
Guys...can you step out for a sec?
I just got off the phone with the Seattle P. D.
there's been another...
I don't even know what to call them, phobia attack?
Yeah, pretty much says it.
anyway, a 911 call came in 10 minutes ago from an apartment over on Lakemont.
seems the building manager has been screaming like a madman about how the place is covered in germs.
we've had Kennedy in custody for hours.
then he's not our guy, which means whoever's doing this is still out there.
great.
all right.
when do you have to get the applications in?
I've got another month or so, that's even if I apply.
what do you mean "if?
I thought that you were going to be the next Clarence Darrow.
Yeah, I thought so, too, but now, with everything that's going on, the world's a different place.
you know, law school just seems so meaningless.
just because world's changed doesn't mean that you have to.
well, maybe I want to.
you know, it's like the world's made up of two different classes now.
you got people with abilities, who are capable of amazing things, people like you, and then you got the regular schmucks, who just have to deal with the fact they're a little less special than they could be.
you know...
I've been thinking about it a lot, and...
I want to take the promicin shot.
those shots are killing people.
I know all about the risks.
I think they're worth it.
they're not worth it, not when you have as much to live for as you do.
think about the odds, okay?
there's a 50-50 chance that you would be committing suicide.
what are you really afraid of, Shawn?
me dying, or me getting an ability?
because that would put us on equal footing, and we can't have that.
this isn't about you and me. - It's always about you and me!
I mean, I thought you'd be excited about this.
I thought you'd be supportive, but I guess I was wrong.
Danny, please, listen -
no, Shawn, I'm glad that you're back with us, but I'm not asking for your permission.
I mean, the stuff is out there, and I'll get it, with or without your help.
I have to clean.
I haven't finished.
I haven't finished. I've got to clean.
the germs are everywhere.
just stop-- don't touch me.
what happened to his hands?
paramedics found him scrubbing them with a Brillo pad.
well, I just checked his apartment.
according to his records, this guy, Haugen, banks at Washington prime and not columbia fidelity.
so this is a separate incident from the one at the bank.
or maybe he knows the victim in some other way.
well, let's canvass the building, talk to the tenants, see if we can find a link.
right.
can I help you?
so is this about ray?
I saw him being loaded into an ambulance.
did you see him before that?
maybe earlier this morning?
no, but my husband did.
our bathroom faucet's been leaking for a week, and Ray still hasn't gotten around to fixing it.
what time do you expect your husband home?
Why?
it's not like they had a fight or anything.
you know, when I was a kid, I used to play with trains, too. Just like...
don't worry, it's not your fault.
Brandon's autistic.
he likes things in a certain order.
there we go. See?
it's
it's ok
it's ok
excuse me?
is this your husband?
Yeah, that's Ryan.
Why?
isn't he one of the guys from the ATM line?
I think we found our link.
you want me to talk to Danny?
you might be able to talk some sense into him, convince him that he'd be, you know, crazy to take that shot.
I can't do that, Shawn.
if Danny wants to take promicin, I say, give it to him.
Kyle, this isn't just some guy on the street with nothing to lose.
this is my little brother.
that shot could kill him.
it didn't kill me.
you took promicin?
Kyle, you took promicin?
three months ago.
my hand was shaking so bad, I could barely hold the syringe, but I survived.
I didn't get an ability, but...
I survived.
since when do you care about getting an ability so much?
it's not just about getting an ability, Shawn.
it's about making a difference.
what Collier's trying to do, change this world, man?
that's important.
I wanted to be a part of that, and I bet Danny feels the same way.
no, Kyle, I don't think that Danny cares about Jordan or changing the world.
he's trying to prove something to himself, or to me.
it's a jealousy thing.
that may be true, but the reason doesn't matter, okay?
if Danny wants to take the shot, I don't think you or anyone else has a right to stop him.
I'm sorry,Tom, but Ryan Powell tested negative for promicin.
I had no choice but to release him.
same with the ATM customers and the bank employees, they all came back clean.
no, that can't be right.
Powell's our only link between the bank victims and Ray Haugen.
you're telling me that's just a coincidence?
I don't know what it is.
but Ryan Powell didn't take promicin, he doesn't have an ability, and he's not the guy we're looking for.
did you lose a filling or something?
my tooth...
it just fell out.
Jed, there's nothing in your hand.
Hey, hey, hey...
just calm down, calm down.
get somebody in here.
this is Meghan Doyle. I need a medical team up here right away.
Hey, look at me, look at me.
I'm coming apart!
it's okay...Somebody, get in here! - don't let me die!
aren't you going to say hello?
you headed some place in particular, or were you combing the city hoping to find me.
where have you been, huh?
that art school you said you were going to?
I went there. They never even heard of you.
does it really matter where I go to school?
the important thing is Shawn's okay.
he is, isn't he?
how'd you know the promicin would wake him up?
who are you?
come on, I think you know that.
what's that supposed to mean?
huh, what's that supposed to mean?
you said you wanted answers.
I'll take you to them.
are you coming or not?
he looks fine to me.
Oh, trust me, he's not.
well, I don't understand.
I mean, you've been together all day.
Yeah, pretty much.
the bank, the apartment building.
we had contact with all the same people.
well, I mean, that's a bit odd, isn't it?
that he would be affected and not you?
it was that kid.
it was that kid, Diana.
it has to be.
when we were at Ryan Powell's apartment, and I was interviewing the wife.
Garrity spoke to the son.
he's autistic.
he started screaming at Garrity and rocking back and forth.
that's when it happened. It has to be.
Jess, come on. Come on.
come on, please!
let's get out of here.
just throw some stuff together and let's go.
Brandon, what do you say, buddy?
you want to go on a little road trip?
we're not going anywhere.
just tell me why ntac is after you.
it's not me they're after.
it's Brandon.
Why?
Brandon hasn't done anything wrong.
has he?
I-I swear, I was only trying to help him.
okay, Jess, just I...
I did...something.
I couldn't tell you.
I'm sorry.
you did something?
Oh...you gave him one of those shots.
you gave him one of those shots?
you bastard!
what did you do to my son?
baby...
you're too late.
they're gone.
where are they, Mr. Powell?
I don't know where Jess is taking him.
we need to find your son before he hurts anyone else. Where are they?
do you know what it's like to have a...a son who won't...hug you, or smile at you?
won't even...won't even look you in the eye?
clear.
is that why you gave him promicin?
I thought if Brandon got an ability, it would make him better, at least help him to communicate.
I-I don't even know what my own son is- is thinking, or feeling, you know?
that's no way for a kid to live. All he does is play with that goddamn train.
Mr. Powell, we're going to need you to think.
where would your wife have taken Brandon?
look, I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
Please...please, none of this is his fault.
he doesn't know.
he has no idea what he's doing.
if anybody's to blame, it's me.
so your wife...she didn't know you injected him?
are you kidding me? 50-50?
she'd never agree to that.
but you were willing to take the risk.
I see other parents with their own kids, and the warmth, and the joking around...
I wanted some of that.
I...
I wasn't trying to kill Brandon.
she has to believe that. I just...
I just...
I just wanted him to have the chance at a...at a normal life.
thank you for your cooperation, Ms. Tyler.
we'll be in contact shortly.
get me a copy of the lab report. - Is that all? We're done?
did I pass?
Hello!
well, you wanted answers, Kyle.
you'll find them in there.
are you coming with me?
it's better if I don't.
what do you know about white light?
not too much, actually.
my great-grandfather founded the group back in 1918.
even at its height, the membership never exceeded a few dozen people.
the whole thing only lasted a few years.
they all died.
burned to death in a fire.
what did these people believe?
they believed that a Messiah would return from the dead and lead the world to salvation.
not the proudest branch on my family tree.
but people are interested in this stuff, so I keep it around.
this was their scripture, and this was the Messiah they were waiting for.
Yeah, that looks like Jordan Collier.
you're not the first person to mention a resemblance.
I don't know, maybe.
feel free to...
thumb through the book if you'd like.
a few of the chapters are too charred to read, and one of them is written in a...
Oh, I don't know, a-a code or something, but there's enough for you to get the gist.
that's great, thank you.
Oh, Brandon...please, not now, okay?
are you hungry, honey?
do you want a snack?
no? Okay.
uh, how about your train? You want your train?
I got your train right here, sweetie, okay?
do you see them? Do you see them? Are they gone?
is what gone? - The snakes!
they're here somewhere, I know it.
don't let them get me, please!
Mrs. Powell, just calm down.
everything will be okay, I promise.
did you see the direction your son was headed, Mrs. Powell?
no, I must've blacked out.
when I opened my eyes, he was gone.
you have to find him. Please, you have to find him.
he's out there all alone. He must be so scared!
all right, Mrs. Powell.
if you were Brandon, if you were your son, where would you go?
Hey, Diana!
Hey, kid, shouldn't you be at home?
hey...
where are your parents, bud?
do they know you're out here?
whoa, buddy.
take it easy. Take it easy!
so, what did you think?
pretty interesting reading, huh?
that's why you brought me here, to read that book?
a Messiah who rises from the dead, who passes out a sacred elixir that changes the world?
I know, that sounds just like Jordan Collier, and that healer who lays his hands upon the sick?
I'm guessing that's supposed to be Shawn.
and don't forget about the shaman, whose visions guide the Messiah down the path to enlightenment.
want to take a stab at who that is?
the shaman is you, Kyle.
me...
I know it might sound a little intimidating
intimidating? Try insane.
all right, you know, I admit that book got few things right, about Jordan, about promicin, but the rest of it's kind of vague, and there's that whole chapter that's in code.
and what about the part that says, the messiah will show us the face of god?
and all will know his face,"and he will smile down upon us ,"and walk among us, and the earth and heaven will be as one
and Collier's going to make that happen, huh?
with your help.
it's a prophecy, Kyle.
I don't believe that.
look, you helped me wake up my cousin.
for that, I am grateful, but this is over.
no, Kyle, it's just beginning.
look, this cult,"white light"?
it's still around, isn't it? And you're one of them.
you're trying to use Jordan to start some kind of crazy religious revival?
I won't be a part of that.
you already are- - I don't want to hear anymore.
just stay the hell away from me.
what changed your mind?
nothing changed my mind.
I don't agree with taking promicin.
I think it's a mistake.
50-50, those are lousy odds.
but you were right about one thing, it's your decision, and I don't want you getting arrested trying to find the stuff yourself.
they're throwing people in jail, Danny, no trial.
I don't get it.
you were with Collier from the beginning.
he put this out there.
I mean, if you don't agree with it, where does that leave you and him?
I wish Jordan had buried that stuff somewhere.
these abilities cause as many problems as they solve.
just do me a favor, okay, and just hold off for a while.
maybe if you read the paper for the next few weeks, law school won't seem so bad.
Yeah, okay. I can do that.
please, don't look at me!
I don't like people looking at me!
okay, I'm going to call this in.
don't worry, sir, we're going to get you help.
are there going to be people there?
I don't like people seeing me.
at least Brandon's giving us a trail to follow.
I hate that we have to sedate him, but I don't know how else to get him back into ntac.
I'm starting to remember why I gave this job up.
Diana, I wish there was another way, but his ability's too much of a threat.
if only Jordan Collier wasn't the most wanted man in the world.
he could take his ability away, couldn't he?
we can't cure him of his ability, but maybe there's a way we can help him control it.
it's okay, Brandon.
everything's going to be okay.
can we just do this, please?
he's been given the inhibitor, so, hopefully, there won't be any kind of danger, but there's still some risk involved.
so if you want to back out, we'd understand.
it's not that, it's just...
I haven't healed anyone in months, and autism is developmental.
I haven't had a lot of success with that in the past.
but you will try?
Yeah.
is-is that it? Did it work?
Brandon, look at me.
da...
da...
da...
dad.
that's right.
I'm your dad.
that...that was incredible.
I forgot how much I liked this.
look at you.
I can give you a few minutes, Mr. Powell, but then I'm afraid you're going to have to come with us.
my son has been in a prison his entire life.
I'm happy to trade places with him.
your test results came back.
whatever you were given to take away your abilities, if you were to take the shot, it would be fatal.
you will never get your abilities back, miss Tyler.
does that mean I'm getting out of here?
the transfer should take place within two weeks.
most nights, too.
I thought you might want to hear some good news.
Dr. Clayton says the people Brandon affected, they're beginning to show signs of improvement.
you think putting him on the inhibitor had something to do with it?
as soon as we muted his ability, their symptoms began to dissipate, which means Garrity should be back in rotation soon.
unless you'd prefer to stick with Skouris.
look, nothing against Jed, but if Diana's going to be around, she's my partner.
okay.
so what happens to Brandon now?
well, as long as his mother brings him in for weekly injections of the inhibitor, he should be able to live a fairly normal life.
more normal than he has up to now anyway.
that was an amazing thing your nephew did.
Yeah, these abilities people get, they come in handy sometimes.
it's worth remembering.
so is it really her? Alana?
I keep trying to convince myself it's not, but, yeah, it's her, and all I can think about is how do I get her back.
maybe all you can do is...
let her go.
I really need to take this. - Yeah.
Dr. Sawyer?
the news isn't good.
your father's had a relapse.
pneumonia?
his breathing's been severely compromised.
he's beaten this before.
I know, but I think it's time we start preparing ourselves for the inevitable.
I'm sorry.
how did you get in here?
it was easy. Where you go, I go.
you're stalking me now, is that it?
come on, Kyle, think.
I don't go to the art institute.
there's no record of me anywhere.
I show up wherever I want to.
what does that tell you?
Hey, kyle...you up for some dinner?
I don't feel like eating alone tonight.
dad, I want you to meet Cassie.
okay. Who's Cassie?
is she someone you met at work?
you find yourself a girlfriend already?
well, that would be a little bit awkward.
see, I'm not what you'd call real.
I'm Kyle's ability.
Hey, I...I don't mean to pry. Sorry.
you should bring her by the house some time.
so...we on for dinner?
Yeah.
Yeah, just give me a couple of minutes, okay?
Yeah. Great.
4400 were taken, 4400 were returned
each has a unique ability
one among them has a message
anyone can become extraordinary
the risk is great
but so are the rewards
and now there's no turning back
the world will have to deal with us.
who's Cassie?
I'm kyle's ability.
you ever go visit your cousin, Shawn?
maybe someone should try injecting him with a big old dose of promicin.
it's all about to happen.
what's going to happen?
thumb through the book, if you'd like.
a lot of it is written in a code or something.
MAIA, this is my friend, Ben.
I've heard a lot about you.
you saw me getting married to my sister's boyfriend?
Mm-hmm.
these shots are free.
give them to anyone who wants them, but be careful to explain the risks.
there are no guarantees.
there never are.
is this seat taken?
it is now.
I'm april, by the way.
so, what's good tonight?
I recommend the lemon drop martini.
bartender, can I get two more?
is that okay?
I don't want you to think i'm hitting on you or anything.
so, what do you do, Peter?
I'm V. P. of client relations for Anexxo.
we're in the fortune 500. Energy. Communications. Some defense work...
I get it.
you're one of the guys that runs the world.
me? No. But i work for those guys.
so, what brings you to Seattle?
the company's in the midst of a major project,
and they hit a little snag, so I'm here to do some triage.
you're going to save the day?
hopefully.
and how are you going to do that?
I'm gonna bribe someone to look the other way.
I can't believe I just told you that.
look, do me a favor, forget what i just said.
it's already forgotten.
so, how much money are we talking about? -300000. I'm picking it up tomorrow afternoon.
Oh, my god.
I don't know why I'm telling you all this stuff.
did they put something in this drink?
who are you anyway?
I'm just a girl you met in a bar.
don't ask me any more questions, okay?
what room are you in, peter? -315
what i just told you, don't repeat it.
it would be bad for you, for me, for everyone
let me guess.
the truth hurts. -It usually does.
so what do we got? Cheating husband? Tax fraud...
try corporate intrigue. Try bribery. Try $300, 000 arriving tomorrow. Room 315.
300 grand?
baby, you're good.
Wow. Okay.
all right, so we'll hit him up for 20% to keep quiet.
that's 60, 000 bucks.
love me? -I do.
and it's not like I can lie to you.
no, you can't.
no one can.
Hey.
glad I remembered this place.
I had a lot of fun summers up here when I was a kid.
it's pretty much a ghost town till June, which is a good thing,
because the whole world's looking for you.
maybe I should just turn myself in.
spend the rest of your life in prison? I don't think so.
it was no coincidence i was there when that van crashed.
I was sent to help you get away.
this is all happening for a reason.
and what would that be?
truthfully, i'm not sure yet. Maybe the answers are in here.
I just hope they're not in this code, or whatever this is.
do you believe that Jordan Collier is a messiah?
and that promicin is going to save the world?
Yeah, I do.
even if that's true, what does it have to do with me?
my abilities are gone.
my body can't tolerate promicin.
I'm the enemy. I hurt shawn.
I tried to kill Jordan Collier.
I did kill Jordan.
believe me.
I know what it feels like to be in prison and think you're never getting out.
to feel you've done things that no one will ever forgive you for.
but no one's so far gone that they can't be forgiven,
that they don't have a role to play in this new world of Jordan Collier's.
I'm meant to be a part of that world.
to help bring it about. And so are you.
you're a hard woman to find, April.
I've been looking everywhere for you.
well, you found me, Di.
now what are you gonna do with me?
well, it wasn't terribly smart Using mom's maiden name On your credit card.
I should have been more creative.
I can only imagine how pissed off you must've been when you'd heard I'd taken the shot.
well, I wasn't terribly happy about it. You're right.
but you are my sister and I was very worried about you.
besides, I knew you never would have taken the shot
if it hadn't been for what happened between ben and me.
feeling a little guilty, are we?
well, don't.
you and Ben may be why I did it, but taking the shot was the right thing for me to do.
I've got money, clothes, a great guy, Colin, who loves me, and a pretty great ability.
how many times a week are you and ben having sex?
three.
wait, that's not... That is none of your business.
I know.
and you told me anyway. That's my ability.
I ask a question, you tell the truth... Every time.
that's a pretty interesting ability. It doesn't work on you, does it?
you mean make me tell the truth?
thankfully, no.
what am I gonna do with you, April?
what am I gonna do with you?
go back to spain, Di.
any guilt you feel about you and Ben... consider yourself absolved.
enjoy your life. And let me enjoy mine.
that's wonderful, Dad.
I'm so glad you're walking better. I can't wait to see it.
look, I have to go.
I love you, too.
Garrity said you wanted to see me.
have you seen the doctor's final report on your nephew's recovery?
Yes, I have.
well, now so has D. C.
those high levels of promicin that were found in his system.
people are wondering where they came from.
Yeah. Beats me.
come on, Tom.
someone walked into the hospital and gave your nephew a massive dose of promicin.
your sister and your son were the only ones with him at the time.
now I'm willing to dismiss Susan as a suspect, but I think you need to have a talk with Kyle.
excuse me? Mr. Farrell.
senator Lenhoff's here to see you.
senator Lenhoff? Are you sure? -She's sure. I'm sure.
and I can see you're beginning to believe it yourself.
roland Lenhoff. The devil made flesh.
we need to talk. In private.
senator, if you're here to try to force me to shut down the center again...
relax, Farrell. I don't want to shut this place.
hell, I want you to heal as many people as possible, which is surprising, I know.
after all, I'm the guy that passed the bill forcing all you 4400s to register your abilities.
Yeah. And you were just warming up.
I seem to remember one speech where you said that if it were up to you,
we'd all be living behind barbed wire.
I knew you were going to bring that up.
have a seat.
come on, sit down.
I'll admit I have been waging a kind of war against you.
trouble is, I just chaired a committee, which is about to issue a 1600-Page report,
which states, in no uncertain terms, that I'm losing that war and you are winning it.
promicin isn't going away.
jordan Collier made damn sure of that.
well, if you're here to sign terms of surrender, I could have some drawn up.
who's talking about surrender?
I fought in 'name.
I have the medals to prove it.
and last year, I took my wife on vacation to Saigon.
I figure if I can make my peace with Charlie, I can make my peace with you.
they're holding a special election to fill a vacant seat on the Seattle City Council.
I want you to run for it.
city Council?
senator, I'm not a politician.
the hell you're not.
you stepped into the spotlight when you reopened this center.
I want you to leverage some of the good work that you've been doing here into something more.
you're the alternative we need to Collier and his Promicin-Pushing radicals.
you can walk the middle path that will unite both 4400s and non-4400s.
and this middle path?
you're planning on walking it with me? -Right down the center.
probably lose any chance of re-Election.
my anti-4400 colleagues will see to that.
but it's what the country needs. What the world needs.
so, what do you say, farrell?
you ready to dance with the devil?
I mean, you should've seen that hotel suite.
it must run at 600 or $700 a night.
the dress, the shoes.
moving around from city to city.
this ability of hers, however she's using it, she's going to get herself into trouble.
what are you smiling about?
Diana, come on, April's alive.
the shot didn't kill her.
she's not even living on the street.
she's even involved with a guy. This is a win.
it just doesn't feel like a win.
she's going to screw up. NTAC are going to get a hold of her, and then what?
Diana, look. Listen to me. Come here for a second.
you traveled 6, 000 miles to find your sister, right?
you offered her help. She refused. It's over.
and now we can move back to Spain.
I guess we can.
you guess? -No, i mean... I mean, we will.
it will take a little time. I mean, the whole work thing.
come on, Diana, it's not that complicated.
all you got to do is go in there and just turn in your gun and badge,
and we're on a plane by tomorrow.
I can't just do that. Not to Tom, to Meghan.
you just give me a week or so and then we're out of here.
we'll tell maia tonight? -Yeah. As soon as we get home.
you're sure you don't want me to go with you?
Nah, you'd just freak the guy out.
Barton knows you put some kind of whammy on him, Right?
april, she's a judgmental bitch and I say good riddance.
all right? Besides, you don't need her anymore. You got me.
Yeah. -Yeah.
so what do you say we meet in the bar a little after 7: 00 for a celebratory cocktail?
okay. -Okay.
Hey, where are we off to next?
I figured we'd go crash with my brother in south beach.
he just moved there from Phoenix.
Jeff says there's money to be made in Miami.
people there are holding onto all kinds of dirty little secrets.
dirty little secrets.
got a minute, buddy?
not really. I'm just...I'm meeting some friends.
it's about shawn.
what about him?
the way he woke up from his coma with all that promicin in him.
people are starting to wonder if you had something to do with it.
by people, do you mean NTAC?
what exactly are you accusing me of, Dad?
I'm not accusing you of anything. I'm asking you.
the day at the hospital, did you give your cousin a shot of promicin?
no, I didn't.
Kyle, listen to me. If you're involved in something.
in what?
I don't know. Last few nights, you haven't come home till morning.
dad, I'm 23 years old. -And I know that.
Kyle, if you're holding anything back, please, tell me now.
I got nothing to say.
except I'm glad Shawn's up and about.
for all I know, whatever Isabelle zapped him with, it wore off.
or not.
I guess we'll never know the truth, will we?
we all got to get used to that.
can I go now?
this is Colin. Leave a message.
babe?
it's Colin! He's been shot!
there was so much blood.
MAIA, will you go to bed now, please, sweetie?
help me, Di. Please, help me.
april, did you honestly believe that this guy, Barton, was just gonna hand you over $60, 000?
seemed like such an easy mark and it's always worked before.
Oh, my god, so that's how you've been using your ability?
to blackmail people. -Oh, god.
don't start lecturing me on right and wrong.
no, it's a little late for that. -Yeah. It is. So save your breath.
all right, ladies. Let's just calm down. Let's just stay calm, Okay?
focus on what's important right now.
he did it, Right? He killed Colin?
well, I would say He's our number one suspect.
but this $300, 000 that anexxo's paying out in bribe money...
Barton didn't happen to mention where it was going?
does it matter?
Colin, the way he looked lying there on the floor...
the hotel suite
it was in Colin's name, right?
Yeah.
or one of his names. He used a couple.
okay. And when they find the body, there's nothing there to connect you to it, is there?
I don't think so.
Ben, will you stay here?
I'm gonna drive April to a motel, or somewhere away from here and away from Maia.
I'm sorry, you'll have to stay there until we figure this out.
are you going to turn me in?
we just have to make this up as we go along.
so I can count on you, right?
if my Dad asks you, and he probably will...
Kyle, I'm not going to tell your Dad that you gave me a promicin shot. Okay?
it's hard, you know? I mean, i love the guy so much, but ...
the things I'm doing, he just wouldn't understand.
I get it, Kyle. I really do.
it's just I've got all of this other stuff I'm dealing with.
Oh, yeah.
if you mean Isabelle Tyler, i don't think you have anything to worry about from her.
she's probably long gone from Seattle.
that's good to know.
I'll fire the extra security I had on.
anyway, I wasn't talking about her.
this is going to sound weird.
roland Lenhoff wants me to run for a seat on the City Council.
the guy behind the dinstman-Lenhoff bill?
he sees it as a "if you can't beat 'em, work with 'em" kind of thing.
and he knows he can't beat us.
that's great, Shawn. You said yes, right?
I'm thinking about it. -You have to do this.
you get elected, that puts a 4400 into the mainstream.
they'll have to start taking us seriously.
and who knows, man? You could become mayor, maybe even governor.
whoa. Just one step at a time.
I don't even know if I can get elected to City Council.
you heal people with your hands.
show me an opponent who can beat that.
do you wanna be my campaign manager? -No.
but you got my vote.
that's one.
not a problem.
I'll have the test results back tomorrow.
what name do I log the samples under? -No name.
but what if they come back promicin positive? -No name, Marco.
I want any paperwork handed to me and me alone. Are we clear?
actually, Tom, I still have some questions.
do me this favor, please.
but I won't ask them.
thank you.
Hey, Marco.
they told me you were down here, Tom.
have you got a minute? -Yeah, yeah, sure.
I know my sister's made a lot of bad choices in her life,
but I also know that April would never have taken that shot if it weren't for me.
I understand you want to protect your sister, Diana,
but if she knows the identity of a murderer...
I can't be responsible for sending April to prison, Tom.
she's promicin positive. It's a life sentence. You know the deal.
besides, I mean, there's a chance that the police could get to Barton on their own.
Yeah, but what if they don't?
what then?
then I'll tell the authorities everything I know.
after I've bought April a one-Way ticket to Marrakech.
april Skouris, Right? -Yeah.
I'm a friend of Colin's brother, Jeff. -Jeff?
no, I'm Larry, but jeff heard what happened.
and he sent me here to get you out of Seattle.
Really? Well, where are we going to go?
my car's right out back. We're going to go to Phoenix.
what about my clothes?
well, you can get some new ones, Okay?
if we hurry, we can catch the next flight.
wait, Phoenix?
Jeff moved to Florida.
it really doesn't matter. -Oh, my god, help!
he's trying to kill me!
di, I really need to know what's going on because none of this makes any sense.
why kill Colin? Why come after me?
we never got our hands on any of that money.
well, that bribe money that Anexxo is paying out,
they clearly don't want anyone knowing about it.
I guess it's time we have a talk with this Peter Barton guy.
Yeah.
I'm coming with you.
you want the truth? I can get it for you.
you sure about that?
I mean, people beat lie detectors all the time.
Tom, do you like my sister?
Diana? Yeah, sure. She's my partner, my friend.
ever had a sexual fantasy about her?
well, once or twice. We were working late.
Diana mentioned we were the only two people working in the building
you can come.
Peter Barton, I'm agent Baldwin. This is agent Skouris. We're with NATC.
Oh, god, not her.
you murdered Colin, didn't you?
murdered? No.
I wasn't even in the room when your boyfriend showed up.
the money.
it wasn't me you were trying to blackmail.
it was the corporation. I had to warn them.
the bribe money. Who'd you pass it off to?
I tell you that, I lose my job.
what was his name, Peter?
Alex Lupone. He's the director of advanced combat systems for the pentagon.
ask him why Anexxo was paying Lupone.
don't. Just don't.
ANEXXO won a contract to develop a new interceptor ballistic body armor for the military.
it was supposed to be impenetrable.
so this body armor, it was defective?
there were some design flaws which left parts of the side and shoulders unprotected.
I was supposed to pay off Lupone to look the other way.
you interfered, and it was taken out of my hands.
who did you tell about Colin and April?
Donald Mitchell. He sits on our board of directors.
he called me personally to handle the payoff.
flew me out here on Anexxo's dime.
where can we find Mitchell?
he's staying at the dorchester hotel.
I didn't know anyone was gonna die.
I don't like standing up here and calling Roland Lenhoff a liar,
but the truth is, he's been one for 40 years.
he did not single-Handedly hold off a platoon of viet cong troops
while his men lay wounded around him.
I know that for a fact because I was one of those men.
turn that damned thing off.
that brave act was performed by staff sergeant Stephen...
guess some of my colleagues heard that you and I were meeting.
didn't waste any time letting me know they weren't real happy about it.
senator, I have to ask, -did you falsify your war record? -No, I did not.
that fellow who gave that little speech... I saved his life that day.
they must've paid him a lot of money to get him to lie like that.
well, I guess if what he says isn't true, then it doesn't really matter.
doesn't have to be true. It's on the television.
I can tough this out.
the question is, can you?
because they're going to be giving you the same kind of treatment.
if not worse.
people have been telling lies about me ever since we came back in that ball of light,
so... does that mean you'll run for City Council?
it means I'm gonna run and I'm gonna win.
that's what I wanted to hear.
I knew I picked myself the right man.
so what happens now?
well, the first thing you got to do is let people know where you stand.
that means telling the world you're against Jordan Collier
and everything that he's been doing.
you want to win this election? Then Jordan Collier is the enemy.
your enemy.
Hey, Kyle. -Hey.
how's it coming?
I'm trying to decipher these coded pages, but I'm not a cryptographer.
can I have a look?
I may have lost my abilities, but I did read the encyclopedia from A to Z.
and you remember all of it?
Yeah, pretty much.
how are you with puzzles?
well, I guess we'll see.
but you did say you brought me here for a reason, Right?
that I'm part of all this.
so maybe this is my chance to prove it.
I don't care what Peter Barton claims.
ANEXXO doesn't bribe government officials.
that's not the way we conduct business.
Mr. Mitchell, did you authorize the payment of $300, 000 to Alex Lupone?
I did not. We never paid Alex Lupone a penny.
now, if you'll excuse me, I have an $80 kobe beef filet growing cold on the plate.
then what was the money for? -It was a down payment.
a down payment for what? -To have Alex Lupone murdered.
I didn't mean that. I don't know why I'd say such a thing.
why have Lupone killed?
I'm not answering any more questions.
was it because you were selling the military defective body armor?
Lupone would have exposed us. We had no choice.
I'm calling my lawyer.
no. Not till you cancel the hit on Lupone.
I don't know what you're talking about.
how do we reach Lupone? What is his phone number?
there isn't one.
he's on vacation in the Brazilian jungle.
the men we hired are already down there.
I have no way of contacting them.
is this really necessary? -Absolutely, it is.
so what do we do now?
well, we'll get in touch with the Brazilian authorities
and hope that they get in touch with Lupone first.
but in the meantime, I'm going to need you to come into NTAC
and make sure that Mitchell repeats his confession for the record.
I can't do that. I walk into NTAC, I don't come out.
no, I'll speak to Meghan. We'll explain the circumstances.
what if that doesn't work? I can't take that chance.
april, without some coaxing from your ability,
Mitchell is going to deny everything he just told us.
he's going to get away with murder.
he's going to get away with Colin's murder.
do you want that? -Look, i can't do that. I'm sorry.
april, you've been running away your entire life.
from your family, from school, from responsibility.
and I don't know, maybe I'm... maybe I'm to blame for that.
maybe I pushed you away.
maybe I wasn't there for you. I don't know.
but this time... this time, you can't run away.
all right ?
do u think us ready to vote for a 4400?
well, I'm hoping so,
being there's a lot more non-4400s out there than people with abilities.
but more people are taking the shot all the time.
how do you feel about that?
do you agree with Jordan Collier's decision to hand out promicin to anybody who wants it?
no. I don't.
half of those people are going to die.
thousands already have.
are you calling Jordan Collier a mass murderer?
I think that Jordan should've waited until the odds of survival were better than 50/50.
a lot better than 50/50.
if he wanted to change the world, there are safer ways of doing so.
like running for City Council?
well, that's a start anyway.
april, it's me.
go away.
not until we've talked. Now just let me in.
no.
come on, open up.
so where do you go now?
I really hadn't thought that far ahead.
I never do, do I?
maybe this time you should.
you want to hear something funny?
I thought when I got this ability, it would change my life.
and it did.
changed my circumstances anyway.
I got better clothes.
I eat in better restaurants.
fly first-Class for the first time in my life.
but it didn't change me.
no ability is going to do that.
you have to change yourself.
and you can.
how?
by marching into NTAC?
that would be brave.
except I'm not brave, am I?
another one of my many faults.
it's not too late.
you can still be the person that you want to be.
look, I can't say that I approve of what you've been up to.
but you did say that you loved this guy, Colin.
and if you did, if that's true, then you have to speak up for him.
and only you can do that.
the man is guilty of multiple felonies and he's threatening to sue us?
Mitchell's claiming harassment, intimidation, oh, and false arrest.
and Anexxo's lawyers have the muscle to make a case like this stick.
he's responsible for one murder we know of, he plotted two others,
and his corporation is trying to defraud the U. S. Government, and we're just gonna let him walk?
Tom, you tell me this guy deserves to be locked up and I'll believe you,
but I need more than your word.
I need that woman, the one that got his initial confession.
look, I know she's promicin positive, but you need to convince her to come forward.
Yeah, well, I don't think that's gonna happen.
well, then there's no way we're going to get an indictment against Mitchell.
not without proof.
I have the proof you need right here.
Hey, Kyle.
everything all right? -No, it's not.
I'm driving in my car, turn on the radio,
and I hear you tell the world that Jordan Collier's a mass murderer.
that is not what I said. I said that he was wrong to hand out promicin.
and that's what I believe.
everything that you are, this building you're standing in, you owe it all to Jordan.
you're willing to betray him for some votes?
Hey, I built this place just as much as Jordan.
he used my healing abilities to raise money for it.
he used me for a lot of things.
not anymore.
I'm my own man now. I make my own choices.
well, you're off to a great start.
you're not only betraying Jordan, you're betraying yourself.
you're a traitor, Shawn.
don't you see that?
don't you see that?
traitor.
how long has it been?
since the last time you asked, about 10 minutes.
since your sister's been in there with Mitchell, about two hours.
Mitchell's been with anexxo for what, 14 years?
imagine the secrets he's saved up.
we could be here all night.
we got a signed confession.
whether it holds up in court remains to be seen,
but we've got enough against him that at least a couple of these charges should stick.
and April?
I'm sorry, Diana.
we have to take her into custody.
it's okay, Di.
everything's okay.
I ? go for it either.
you must've been pretty convincing. -Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt.
but i have been up all night and what we're doing to april just isn't fair.
she didn't have to come forward.
Mitchell could be a free man right now,
instead of having his picture plastered all over the papers.
she did the right thing, and we're locking her up?
we need to offer her some kind of amnesty, not punish her.
Skouris, we're not punishing her. We're hiring her.
according to meghan, NTAC... the attorney general's office... the FBI...
they're already fighting over who gets me when.
and all I have to do is ask people questions.
it's not always going to be at a bar over drinks.
some of the people you meet and the questions you have to ask...
some of the answers you're going to hear...
it can get pretty ugly.
meghan was pretty upfront about that.
still, it's gotta be better than prison.
I must say, the perks are pretty good.
I get an apartment, a nice salary, health insurance, even a clothing allowance.
and let's not forget Eric and Ralph. Or is it Ralph and Eric?
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
their job is to make sure I show up wherever I need to be.
knowing me, it won't be as easy as it sounds.
you think I'm gonna screw this up, don't you?
april, maybe the question you should be asking me is
if I want you to succeed, and the answer is a definite yes.
well, i'll try not to let either one of us down.
and I promise to call or email and let you know how I'm doing.
so... when are you leaving?
you know, for Spain, or wherever you guys decide?
I'm not leaving.
I'm staying right here in Seattle.
did I just say that?
does Ben know?
no. I hadn't realized it until just now.
you're gonna have to tell him.
Yeah.
I'm really happy for both of you.
but we're not leaving this table until we've made a decision.
are we living in France or Spain?
neither.
don't hate me, Ben. Please.
Oh, god...
I quit work. I went to Spain. I tried. I really tried.
but I belong here.
with Tom, and with NTAC, the search for Collier.
I'm a part of that. My daughter's a part of that.
and now my sister is, too.
so what happens to us?
we go back to our own lives?
back to our work?
what, see each other a few days a month?
for now.
we could have so much more, Diana.
Maia said that we'd get married.
and Maia's never wrong.
well, I hope not.
me too.
the lab report you asked for.
the one and only copy.
samples came back positive for promicin.
someone's definitely walking around with an ability.
Thanks, Marco.
when the chosen have taken the elixir and proved their faith in the Messiah,
then all will follow in their wake.
only then will the father reveal his true face, and paradise and the world will be as one.
I think that's a pretty accurate translation.
the elixir, that's gotta be promicin.
and we know Collier's supposed to be the Messiah.
and the father?
I don't know. God, I guess?
but who are the chosen? -Flip the page.
it's a list of names.
Yeah. 200 in all. And most of them you'll recognize.
politicians, scientists, athletes...
these people, they're all alive today.
but this book was written 85 years ago. -I know.
all right, so all these people have to take the shot?
and that's supposed to influence more and more people to do the same, Right?
until what? Everyone has an ability?
those who survive, anyway.
and that's when God's supposed to show up?
I think you'd better look at the last name.
the WORLD WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH US.
[TOM]: WHO'S CASSIE?
I'm KYLE'S ABILITY.
[CASSIE]: YOU EVER GO VISIT YOUR COUSIN, SHAWN?
maybe SOMEONE SHOULD TRY INJECTING HIM WITH A BIG OLD DOSE OF PROMICIN.
it's ALL ABOUT TO HAPPEN.
what's GOING TO HAPPEN?
thumb THROUGH THE BOOK, IF YOU'D LIKE.
a LOT OF IT IS WRITTEN IN A CODE OR SOMETHING.
MAIA, THIS IS MY FRIEND, BEN.
I've HEARD A LOT ABOUT YOU.
you SAW ME GETTING MARRIED TO MY SISTER'S BOYFRIEND?
Mm-hmm.
these SHOTS ARE FREE.
give THEM TO ANYONE WHO WANTS THEM,
but BE CAREFUL TO EXPLAIN THE RISKS.
there ARE NO GUARANTEES.
there NEVER ARE.
is THIS SEAT TAKEN?
it IS NOW.
I'm APRIL, BY THE WAY.
so, WHAT'S GOOD TONIGHT?
I RECOMMEND THE LEMON DROP MARTINI.
bartender, CAN I GET TWO MORE?
is THAT OKAY?
I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK I'M HITTING ON YOU OR ANYTHING.
so, WHAT DO YOU DO, PETER?
I'm V. P. OF CLIENT RELATIONS FOR ANEXXO.
we're IN THE FORTUNE 500.
energy. COMMUNICATIONS. SOME DEFENSE WORK...
I GET IT.
you're ONE OF THE GUYS THAT RUNS THE WORLD.
me? NO.
but I WORK FOR THOSE GUYS.
so, WHAT BRINGS YOU TO SEATTLE?
the COMPANY'S IN THE MIDST OF A MAJOR PROJECT, AND THEY HIT A LITTLE SNAG, SO I'M HERE TO DO SOME TRIAGE.
you're GOING TO SAVE THE DAY?
hopefully.
and HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO THAT?
I'm GONNA BRIBE SOMEONE TO LOOK THE OTHER WAY.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I JUST TOLD YOU THAT.
look, DO ME A FAVOR, FORGET WHAT I JUST SAID.
it's ALREADY FORGOTTEN.
so, HOW MUCH MONEY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?
300000
I'm PICKING IT UP TOMORROW AFTERNOON.
Oh, MY GOD.
I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M TELLING YOU ALL THIS STUFF.
did THEY PUT SOMETHING IN THIS DRINK?
who ARE YOU ANYWAY?
I'm JUST A GIRL YOU MET IN A BAR.
don't ASK ME ANY MORE QUESTIONS, OKAY?
what ROOM ARE YOU IN, PETER?
what I JUST TOLD YOU, DON'T REPEAT IT.
it WOULD BE BAD FOR YOU, FOR ME, FOR EVERYONE--EVERYONE.
let ME GUESS.
the TRUTH HURTS. IT USUALLY DOES.
so WHAT DO WE GOT?
cheating HUSBAND? TAX FRAUD...
try CORPORATE INTRIGUE.
try BRIBERY.
try $300, 000 ARRIVING TOMORROW.
room 315.
300 GRAND?
baby, YOU'RE GOOD.
Wow. OKAY.
all RIGHT, SO WE'LL HIT HIM UP FOR 20% TO KEEP QUIET.
that's 60, 000 BUCKS.
love ME?
I DO.
and IT'S NOT LIKE I CAN LIE TO YOU.
no, YOU CAN'T.
no ONE CAN.
glad I REMEMBERED THIS PLACE.
I HAD A LOT OF FUN SUMMERS UP HERE WHEN I WAS A KID.
it's PRETTY MUCH A GHOST TOWN TILL JUNE,
which IS A GOOD THING,
because THE WHOLE WORLD'S LOOKING FOR YOU.
maybe I SHOULD JUST TURN MYSELF IN.
spend THE REST OF YOUR LIFE IN PRISON?
I DON'T THINK SO.
it WAS NO COINCIDENCE
I WAS THERE WHEN THAT VAN CRASHED.
I WAS SENT TO HELP YOU GET AWAY.
this IS ALL HAPPENING FOR A REASON.
and WHAT WOULD THAT BE?
truthfully, I'M NOT SURE YET. MAYBE THE ANSWERS ARE IN HERE.
I JUST HOPE THEY'RE NOT IN THIS CODE,
or WHATEVER THIS IS.
do YOU BELIEVE THAT JORDAN COLLIER IS A MESSIAH?
and THAT PROMICIN IS GOING TO SAVE THE WORLD?
Yeah, I DO.
even IF THAT'S TRUE, WHAT DOES IT HAVE TO DO WITH ME?
my ABILITIES ARE GONE.
my BODY CAN'T TOLERATE PROMICIN.
I'm THE ENEMY. I HURT SHAWN.
I TRIED TO KILL JORDAN COLLIER.
I DID KILL JORDAN.
believe ME.
I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE IN PRISON AND THINK YOU'RE NEVER GETTING OUT.
to FEEL YOU'VE DONE THINGS THAT NO ONE WILL EVER FORGIVE YOU FOR.
but NO ONE'S SO FAR GONE THAT THEY CAN'T BE FORGIVEN,
that THEY DON'T HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY IN THIS NEW WORLD OF JORDAN COLLIER'S.
I'm MEANT TO BE A PART OF THAT WORLD. TO HELP BRING IT ABOUT.
and SO ARE YOU.
you're A HARD WOMAN TO FIND, APRIL.
I've BEEN LOOKING EVERYWHERE FOR YOU.
well, YOU FOUND ME, DI.
now WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH ME?
well, IT WASN'T TERRIBLY SMART
using MOM'S MAIDEN NAME ON YOUR CREDIT CARD.
if I KNOW YOU WOULD COME TO SEE ME I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CREATIVE.
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE
how PISSED OFF YOU MUST'VE BEEN WHEN YOU'D HEARD I'D TAKEN THE SHOT.
well, I WASN'T TERRIBLY HAPPY ABOUT IT.
you're RIGHT.
but YOU ARE MY SISTER
and I WAS VERY WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
besides, I KNEW
you NEVER WOULD HAVE TAKEN THE SHOT IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN BEN AND ME.
feeling A LITTLE GUILTY, ARE WE?
well, DON'T.
you AND BEN MAY BE WHY I DID IT, BUT TAKING THE SHOT WAS THE RIGHT THING FOR ME TO DO.
I've GOT MONEY, CLOTHES, A GREAT GUY, COLIN, WHO LOVES ME, AND A PRETTY GREAT ABILITY.
how MANY TIMES A WEEK ARE YOU AND BEN HAVING SEX?
three.
wait, THAT'S NOT
that IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.
I KNOW.
and YOU TOLD ME ANYWAY.
that's MY ABILITY.
I ASK A QUESTION, YOU TELL THE TRUTH
every TIME.
that's A PRETTY INTERESTING ABILITY.
it DOESN'T WORK ON YOU, DOES IT?
you MEAN MAKE ME TELL THE TRUTH?
thankfully, NO.
what AM I GONNA DO WITH YOU, APRIL?
what AM I GONNA DO WITH YOU?
go BACK TO SPAIN, DI.
any GUILT YOU FEEL ABOUT YOU AND BEN CONSIDER YOURSELF ABSOLVED.
enjoy YOUR LIFE.
and LET ME ENJOY MINE.
that's WONDERFUL, DAD.
I'm SO GLAD YOU'RE WALKING BETTER.
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IT.
look, I HAVE TO GO.
I LOVE YOU, TOO.
Garrity SAID YOU WANTED TO SEE ME.
have YOU SEEN THE DOCTOR'S FINAL REPORT ON YOUR NEPHEW'S RECOVERY?
Yes, I HAVE.
well, NOW SO HAS D. C.
those HIGH LEVELS OF PROMICIN THAT WERE FOUND IN HIS SYSTEM
people ARE WONDERING WHERE THEY CAME FROM.
Yeah. BEATS ME.
come ON, TOM.
someone WALKED INTO THE HOSPITAL AND GAVE YOUR NEPHEW A MASSIVE DOSE OF PROMICIN.
your SISTER AND YOUR SON WERE THE ONLY ONES WITH HIM AT THE TIME.
now I'M WILLING TO DISMISS SUSAN
as A SUSPECT,
but I THINK YOU NEED TO HAVE A TALK WITH KYLE.
excuse ME? MR. FARRELL.
senator LENHOFF'S HERE TO SEE YOU.
senator LENHOFF? ARE YOU SURE?
she's SURE. I'M SURE.
and I CAN SEE
you're BEGINNING TO BELIEVE IT YOURSELF.
the DEVIL MADE FLESH.
we NEED TO TALK. IN PRIVATE.
senator, IF YOU'RE HERE TO TRY TO FORCE ME TO SHUT DOWN THE CENTER AGAIN...
relax, FARRELL.
I DON'T WANT TO SHUT THIS PLACE.
hell, I WANT YOU TO HEAL AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE, WHICH IS SURPRISING, I KNOW.
after ALL, I'M THE GUY THAT PASSED THE BILL FORCING ALL YOU 4400s TO REGISTER YOUR ABILITIES.
Yeah. AND YOU WERE JUST WARMING UP.
I SEEM TO REMEMBER ONE SPEECH
where YOU SAID THAT IF IT WERE UP TO YOU, WE'D ALL BE LIVING BEHIND BARBED WIRE.
I KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO BRING THAT UP.
have A SEAT.
come ON, SIT DOWN.
I'll ADMIT I HAVE BEEN WAGING A KIND OF WAR AGAINST YOU.
trouble IS, I JUST CHAIRED A COMMITTEE,
which IS ABOUT TO ISSUE A 1600-PAGE REPORT, WHICH STATES, IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS, THAT I'M LOSING THAT WAR AND YOU ARE WINNING IT.
promicin ISN'T GOING AWAY.
jordan COLLIER MADE DAMN SURE OF THAT.
well, IF YOU'RE HERE TO SIGN TERMS OF SURRENDER, I COULD HAVE SOME DRAWN UP.
who's TALKING ABOUT SURRENDER?
I FOUGHT IN 'NAM.
I HAVE THE MEDALS TO PROVE IT.
and LAST YEAR, I TOOK MY WIFE ON VACATION TO SAIGON.
I FIGURE IF I CAN MAKE MY PEACE WITH CHARLIE, I CAN MAKE MY PEACE WITH YOU.
they're HOLDING A SPECIAL ELECTION TO FILL A VACANT SEAT ON THE SEATTLE CITY COUNCIL.
I WANT YOU TO RUN FOR IT.
city COUNCIL?
senator, I'M NOT A POLITICIAN.
the HELL YOU'RE NOT.
you STEPPED INTO THE SPOTLIGHT WHEN YOU REOPENED THIS CENTER.
I WANT YOU TO LEVERAGE SOME OF THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING HERE INTO SOMETHING MORE.
you're THE ALTERNATIVE WE NEED TO COLLIER AND HIS PROMICIN-PUSHING RADICALS.
you CAN WALK THE MIDDLE PATH THAT WILL UNITE BOTH 4400s AND NON-4400s.
and THIS MIDDLE PATH?
you're PLANNING ON WALKING IT WITH ME?
right DOWN THE CENTER.
probably LOSE ANY CHANCE OF RE-ELECTION.
my ANTI-4400 COLLEAGUES WILL SEE TO THAT.
but IT'S WHAT THE COUNTRY NEEDS.
what THE WORLD NEEDS.
so, WHAT DO YOU SAY, FARRELL?
you READY TO DANCE WITH THE DEVIL?
I MEAN, YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN THAT HOTEL SUITE.
it MUST RUN AT 600 OR $700 A NIGHT.
the DRESS, THE SHOES.
moving AROUND FROM CITY TO CITY.
this ABILITY OF HERS, HOWEVER SHE'S USING IT, SHE'S GOING TO GET HERSELF INTO TROUBLE.
what ARE YOU SMILING ABOUT?
Diana, COME ON, APRIL'S ALIVE.
the SHOT DIDN'T KILL HER.
she's NOT EVEN LIVING ON THE STREET.
she's EVEN INVOLVED WITH A GUY.
this IS A WIN.
it JUST DOESN'T FEEL LIKE A WIN.
she's GOING TO SCREW UP.
ntac ARE GOING TO GET A HOLD OF HER, AND THEN WHAT?
Diana, LOOK. LISTEN TO ME.
come HERE FOR A SECOND.
you TRAVELED 6, 000 MILES TO FIND YOUR SISTER, RIGHT?
you OFFERED HER HELP.
she REFUSED.
it's OVER.
and NOW WE CAN MOVE BACK TO SPAIN.
I GUESS WE CAN.
you GUESS?
no, I MEAN-- I MEAN, WE WILL.
it WILL TAKE A LITTLE TIME.
I MEAN, THE WHOLE WORK THING.
come ON, DIANA, IT'S NOT THAT COMPLICATED.
all YOU GOT TO DO IS GO IN THERE
and JUST TURN IN YOUR GUN AND BADGE, AND WE'RE ON A PLANE BY TOMORROW.
I CAN'T JUST DO THAT.
not TO TOM, TO MEGHAN.
you JUST GIVE ME A WEEK OR SO AND THEN WE'RE OUT OF HERE.
we'll TELL MAIA TONIGHT?
Yeah. AS SOON AS WE GET HOME.
you're SURE YOU DON'T WANT ME TO GO WITH YOU?
Nah, YOU'D JUST FREAK THE GUY OUT.
Barton KNOWS YOU PUT SOME KIND OF WHAMMY ON HIM, RIGHT?
I DIDN'T THINK SHE CARED ENOUGH.
april, SHE'S A JUDGMENTAL BITCH AND I SAY GOOD RIDDANCE.
all RIGHT?
besides, YOU DON'T NEED HER ANYMORE.
you GOT ME.
Yeah.
Yeah.
so WHAT DO YOU SAY WE MEET IN THE BAR A LITTLE AFTER 7: 00 FOR A CELEBRATORY COCKTAIL?
okay.
okay.
Hey, WHERE ARE WE OFF TO NEXT?
I FIGURED WE'D GO CRASH WITH MY BROTHER IN SOUTH BEACH.
he JUST MOVED THERE FROM PHOENIX.
Jeff SAYS THERE'S MONEY TO BE MADE IN MIAMI.
people THERE ARE HOLDING ONTO ALL KINDS OF DIRTY LITTLE SECRETS.
dirty LITTLE SECRETS.
got A MINUTE, BUDDY?
not REALLY. I'M JUST-- I'M MEETING SOME FRIENDS.
it's ABOUT SHAWN.
what ABOUT HIM?
the WAY HE WOKE UP FROM HIS COMA WITH ALL THAT PROMICIN IN HIM.
people ARE STARTING TO WONDER
if YOU HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT.
by PEOPLE, DO YOU MEAN NTAC?
what EXACTLY ARE YOU ACCUSING ME OF, DAD?
I'm NOT ACCUSING YOU OF ANYTHING.
I'm ASKING YOU.
the DAY AT THE HOSPITAL, DID YOU GIVE YOUR COUSIN A SHOT OF PROMICIN?
no, I DIDN'T.
Kyle, LISTEN TO ME.
if YOU'RE INVOLVED IN SOMETHING.
in WHAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
last FEW NIGHTS, YOU HAVEN'T COME HOME TILL MORNING.
dad, I'M 23 YEARS OLD. AND I KNOW THAT.
Kyle, IF YOU'RE HOLDING ANYTHING BACK,
please, TELL ME NOW.
I GOT NOTHING TO SAY.
except I'M GLAD SHAWN'S UP AND ABOUT.
for ALL I KNOW, WHATEVER ISABELLE ZAPPED HIM WITH, IT WORE OFF. OR NOT.
I GUESS WE'LL NEVER KNOW THE TRUTH, WILL WE?
we ALL GOT TO GET USED TO THAT.
can I GO NOW?
this IS COLIN. LEAVE A MESSAGE.
babe?
it's COLIN! HE'S BEEN SHOT!
there WAS SO MUCH BLOOD.
MAIA, WILL YOU GO TO BED NOW, PLEASE, SWEETIE?
help ME, DI. PLEASE, HELP ME.
april, DID YOU HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT THIS GUY, BARTON, WAS JUST GONNA HAND YOU OVER $60, 000?
seemed LIKE SUCH AN EASY MARK AND IT'S ALWAYS WORKED BEFORE.
Oh, MY GOD,
so THAT'S HOW YOU'VE BEEN USING YOUR ABILITY?
to BLACKMAIL PEOPLE.
Oh, GOD. DON'T START LECTURING ME ON RIGHT AND WRONG.
no, IT'S A LITTLE LATE FOR THAT.
Yeah. IT IS.
so SAVE YOUR BREATH.
all RIGHT, LADIES. LET'S JUST CALM DOWN.
let's JUST STAY CALM, OKAY?
focus ON WHAT'S IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW.
he DID IT, RIGHT? HE KILLED COLIN?
well, I WOULD SAY HE'S OUR NUMBER ONE SUSPECT.
but THIS $300, 000 THAT ANEXXO'S PAYING OUT IN BRIBE MONEY...
Barton DIDN'T HAPPEN TO MENTION WHERE IT WAS GOING?
does IT MATTER?
Colin, THE WAY HE LOOKED LYING THERE ON THE FLOOR...
the HOTEL SUITE.
it WAS IN COLIN'S NAME, RIGHT?
Yeah.
or ONE OF HIS NAMES. HE USED A COUPLE.
okay. AND WHEN THEY FIND THE BODY, THERE'S NOTHING THERE TO CONNECT YOU TO IT, IS THERE?
I DON'T THINK SO.
Ben, WILL YOU STAY HERE?
I'm GONNA DRIVE APRIL TO A MOTEL,
or SOMEWHERE AWAY FROM HERE
and AWAY FROM MAIA.
I'm SORRY, YOU'LL HAVE TO STAY THERE UNTIL WE FIGURE THIS OUT.
are YOU GOING TO TURN ME IN?
we JUST HAVE TO MAKE THIS UP AS WE GO ALONG.
[KYLE]: SO I CAN COUNT ON YOU, RIGHT?
if MY DAD ASKS YOU, AND HE PROBABLY WILL...
Kyle, I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOUR DAD THAT YOU GAVE ME A PROMICIN SHOT.
okay?
it's HARD, YOU KNOW? I MEAN, I LOVE THE GUY SO MUCH, BUT THE THINGS I'M DOING, HE JUST WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.
I GET IT, KYLE.
I REALLY DO.
it's JUST I'VE GOT ALL OF THIS OTHER STUFF I'M DEALING WITH.
Oh, YEAH. IF YOU MEAN ISABELLE TYLER,
I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT FROM HER.
she's PROBABLY LONG GONE FROM SEATTLE.
that's GOOD TO KNOW.
I'll FIRE THE EXTRA SECURITY I HAD ON.
anyway, I WASN'T TALKING ABOUT HER.
this IS GOING TO SOUND WEIRD.
roland LENHOFF WANTS ME TO RUN FOR A SEAT ON THE CITY COUNCIL.
the GUY BEHIND THE DINSTMAN-LENHOFF BILL?
he SEES IT AS A "IF YOU CAN'T BEAT 'EM, WORK WITH 'EM" KIND OF THING.
and HE KNOWS HE CAN'T BEAT US.
that's GREAT, SHAWN.
you SAID YES, RIGHT?
I'm THINKING ABOUT IT.
you HAVE TO DO THIS.
you GET ELECTED, THAT PUTS A 4400 INTO THE MAINSTREAM.
they'll HAVE TO START TAKING US SERIOUSLY.
and WHO KNOWS, MAN?
you COULD BECOME MAYOR, MAYBE EVEN GOVERNOR.
whoa. JUST ONE STEP AT A TIME.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF I CAN GET ELECTED TO CITY COUNCIL.
you HEAL PEOPLE WITH YOUR HANDS.
show ME AN OPPONENT WHO CAN BEAT THAT.
do YOU WANNA BE MY CAMPAIGN MANAGER?
no.
but YOU GOT MY VOTE.
that's ONE.
not A PROBLEM.
I'll HAVE THE TEST RESULTS BACK TOMORROW.
what NAME DO I LOG THE SAMPLES UNDER?
no NAME.
but WHAT IF THEY COME BACK PROMICIN POSITIVE?
no NAME, MARCO.
I WANT ANY PAPERWORK HANDED TO ME AND ME ALONE.
are WE CLEAR?
actually, TOM, I STILL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS.
do ME THIS FAVOR, PLEASE.
but I WON'T ASK THEM.
thank YOU.
they TOLD ME YOU WERE DOWN HERE, TOM.
have YOU GOT A MINUTE?
Yeah, YEAH, SURE.
I KNOW MY SISTER'S MADE A LOT OF BAD CHOICES IN HER LIFE,
but I ALSO KNOW
that APRIL WOULD NEVER HAVE TAKEN THAT SHOT
if IT WEREN'T FOR ME.
I UNDERSTAND YOU WANT TO PROTECT YOUR SISTER, DIANA,
but IF SHE KNOWS THE IDENTITY OF A MURDERER
I CAN'T BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SENDING APRIL TO PRISON, TOM.
she's PROMICIN POSITIVE.
it's A LIFE SENTENCE.
you KNOW THE DEAL.
besides, I MEAN, THERE'S A CHANCE THAT THE POLICE COULD GET TO BARTON ON THEIR OWN.
Yeah, BUT WHAT IF THEY DON'T?
what THEN?
then I'LL TELL THE AUTHORITIES EVERYTHING I KNOW.
after I'VE BOUGHT APRIL A ONE-WAY TICKET TO MARRAKECH.
april SKOURIS, RIGHT?
Yeah.
I'm A FRIEND OF COLIN'S BROTHER, JEFF.
Jeff? NO, I'M LARRY, BUT JEFF HEARD WHAT HAPPENED AND HE SENT ME HERE TO GET YOU OUT OF SEATTLE.
Really?
well, WHERE ARE WE GOING TO GO?
my CAR'S RIGHT OUT BACK.
we're GOING TO GO TO PHOENIX.
what ABOUT MY CLOTHES?
well, YOU CAN GET SOME NEW ONES, OKAY?
if WE HURRY, WE CAN CATCH THE NEXT FLIGHT.
wait, PHOENIX?
Jeff MOVED TO FLORIDA.
it REALLY DOESN'T MATTER.
Oh, MY GOD, HELP!
he's TRYING TO KILL ME!
di, I REALLY NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
because NONE OF THIS MAKES ANY SENSE.
why KILL COLIN?
why COME AFTER ME?
we NEVER GOT OUR HANDS ON ANY OF THAT MONEY.
well, THAT BRIBE MONEY THAT ANEXXO IS PAYING OUT,
they CLEARLY DON'T WANT ANYONE KNOWING ABOUT IT.
I GUESS IT'S TIME WE HAVE A TALK WITH THIS PETER BARTON GUY.
Yeah.
I'm COMING WITH YOU.
you WANT THE TRUTH?
I CAN GET IT FOR YOU.
you SURE ABOUT THAT?
I MEAN, PEOPLE BEAT LIE DETECTORS ALL THE TIME.
Tom, DO YOU LIKE MY SISTER?
Diana? YEAH, SURE.
she's MY PARTNER, MY FRIEND.
ever HAD A SEXUAL FANTASY ABOUT HER?
well, ONCE OR TWICE.
we WERE WORKING LATE.
Diana MENTIONED WE WERE THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE WORKING IN THE BUILDING
you CAN COME.
Peter BARTON, I'M AGENT BALDWIN.
this IS AGENT SKOURIS. WE'RE WITH NTAC.
Oh, GOD, NOT HER.
you MURDERED COLIN, DIDN'T YOU?
murdered? NO.
I WASN'T EVEN IN THE ROOM WHEN YOUR BOYFRIEND SHOWED UP.
the MONEY.
it WASN'T ME YOU WERE TRYING TO BLACKMAIL.
it WAS THE CORPORATION.
I HAD TO WARN THEM.
the BRIBE MONEY. WHO'D YOU PASS IT OFF TO?
I TELL YOU THAT, I LOSE MY JOB.
what WAS HIS NAME, PETER?
he's THE DIRECTOR OF ADVANCED COMBAT SYSTEMS FOR THE PENTAGON.
ask HIM WHY ANEXXO WAS PAYING LUPONE.
don't.
just DON'T.
ANEXXO WON A CONTRACT TO DEVELOP A NEW INTERCEPTOR BALLISTIC BODY ARMOR FOR THE MILITARY.
it WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IMPENETRABLE.
so THIS BODY ARMOR, IT WAS DEFECTIVE?
there WERE SOME DESIGN FLAWS WHICH LEFT PARTS OF THE SIDE AND SHOULDERS UNPROTECTED.
I WAS SUPPOSED TO PAY OFF LUPONE TO LOOK THE OTHER WAY.
you INTERFERED,
and IT WAS TAKEN OUT OF MY HANDS.
who DID YOU TELL ABOUT COLIN AND APRIL?
he SITS ON OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.
he CALLED ME PERSONALLY TO HANDLE THE PAYOFF.
flew ME OUT HERE ON ANEXXO'S DIME.
where CAN WE FIND MITCHELL?
he's STAYING AT THE DORCHESTER HOTEL.
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE WAS GONNA DIE.
I DON'T LIKE STANDING UP HERE AND CALLING ROLAND LENHOFF A LIAR, BUT THE TRUTH IS, HE'S BEEN ONE FOR 40 YEARS.
he DID NOT SINGLE-HANDEDLY HOLD OFF A PLATOON OF VIET CONG TROOPS WHILE HIS MEN LAY WOUNDED AROUND HIM.
I KNOW THAT FOR A FACT BECAUSE I WAS ONE OF THOSE MEN.
turn THAT DAMNED THING OFF.
that BRAVE ACT WAS PERFORMED BY STAFF SERGEANT STEPHEN
guess SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HEARD THAT YOU AND I WERE MEETING.
didn't WASTE ANY TIME LETTING ME KNOW THEY WEREN'T REAL HAPPY ABOUT IT.
senator, I HAVE TO ASK,
did YOU FALSIFY YOUR WAR RECORD?
no, I DID NOT.
that FELLOW WHO GAVE THAT LITTLE SPEECH...
I SAVED HIS LIFE THAT DAY.
they MUST'VE PAID HIM A LOT OF MONEY TO GET HIM TO LIE LIKE THAT.
well, I GUESS IF WHAT HE SAYS ISN'T TRUE,
then IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.
doesn't HAVE TO BE TRUE. IT'S ON THE TELEVISION.
I CAN TOUGH THIS OUT.
the QUESTION IS, CAN YOU?
because THEY'RE GOING TO BE GIVING YOU THE SAME KIND OF TREATMENT.
if NOT WORSE.
people HAVE BEEN TELLING LIES ABOUT ME
ever SINCE WE CAME BACK IN THAT BALL OF LIGHT, SO...
does THAT MEAN YOU'LL RUN FOR CITY COUNCIL?
it MEANS I'M GONNA RUN AND I'M GONNA WIN.
that's WHAT I WANTED TO HEAR.
I KNEW I PICKED MYSELF THE RIGHT MAN.
so WHAT HAPPENS NOW?
well, THE FIRST THING YOU GOT TO DO IS LET PEOPLE KNOW WHERE YOU STAND.
that MEANS TELLING THE WORLD YOU'RE AGAINST JORDAN COLLIER
and EVERYTHING THAT HE'S BEEN DOING.
you WANT TO WIN THIS ELECTION?
then JORDAN COLLIER IS THE ENEMY.
your ENEMY.
how's IT COMING?
I'm TRYING TO DECIPHER THESE CODED PAGES,
but I'M NOT A CRYPTOGRAPHER.
can I HAVE A LOOK?
I MAY HAVE LOST MY ABILITIES,
but I DID READ THE ENCYCLOPEDIA FROM A TO Z.
and YOU REMEMBER ALL OF IT?
Yeah, PRETTY MUCH.
how ARE YOU WITH PUZZLES?
well, I GUESS WE'LL SEE.
but YOU DID SAY
you BROUGHT ME HERE FOR A REASON, RIGHT?
that I'M PART OF ALL THIS.
so MAYBE THIS IS MY CHANCE TO PROVE IT.
I DON'T CARE WHAT PETER BARTON CLAIMS.
ANEXXO DOESN'T BRIBE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.
that's NOT THE WAY WE CONDUCT BUSINESS.
Mr. MITCHELL, DID YOU AUTHORIZE THE PAYMENT OF $300, 000 TO ALEX LUPONE?
I DID NOT.
we NEVER PAID ALEX LUPONE A PENNY.
now, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I HAVE AN $80 KOBE BEEF FILET GROWING COLD ON THE PLATE.
then WHAT WAS THE MONEY FOR?
it WAS A DOWN PAYMENT.
a DOWN PAYMENT FOR WHAT?
to HAVE ALEX LUPONE MURDERED.
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT.
I DON'T KNOW WHY I'D SAY SUCH A THING.
why HAVE LUPONE KILLED?
I'm NOT ANSWERING ANY MORE QUESTIONS.
was IT BECAUSE YOU WERE SELLING THE MILITARY DEFECTIVE BODY ARMOR?
Lupone WOULD HAVE EXPOSED US. WE HAD NO CHOICE.
I'm CALLING MY LAWYER.
no. NOT TILL YOU CANCEL THE HIT ON LUPONE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
how DO WE REACH LUPONE?
what IS HIS PHONE NUMBER? THERE ISN'T ONE.
he's ON VACATION IN THE BRAZILIAN JUNGLE.
the MEN WE HIRED ARE ALREADY DOWN THERE.
I HAVE NO WAY OF CONTACTING THEM.
is THIS REALLY NECESSARY?
absolutely, IT IS.
so WHAT DO WE DO NOW?
well, WE'LL GET IN TOUCH WITH THE BRAZILIAN AUTHORITIES
and HOPE THAT THEY GET IN TOUCH WITH LUPONE FIRST.
but IN THE MEANTIME, I'M GOING TO NEED YOU TO COME INTO NTAC AND MAKE SURE THAT MITCHELL REPEATS HIS CONFESSION FOR THE RECORD.
I CAN'T DO THAT.
I WALK INTO NTAC, I DON'T COME OUT.
no, I'LL SPEAK TO MEGHAN. WE'LL EXPLAIN THE CIRCUMSTANCES.
what IF THAT DOESN'T WORK? I CAN'T TAKE THAT CHANCE.
april, WITHOUT SOME COAXING FROM YOUR ABILITY, MITCHELL IS GOING TO DENY EVERYTHING HE JUST TOLD US.
he's GOING TO GET AWAY WITH MURDER.
he's GOING TO GET AWAY WITH COLIN'S MURDER.
do YOU WANT THAT?
look, I CAN'T DO THAT. I'M SORRY.
april, YOU'VE BEEN RUNNING AWAY YOUR ENTIRE LIFE.
from YOUR FAMILY, FROM SCHOOL,
from RESPONSIBILITY.
and I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE I'M...
maybe I'M TO BLAME FOR THAT.
maybe I PUSHED YOU AWAY.
maybe I WASN'T THERE FOR YOU.
I DON'T KNOW.
but THIS TIME...
this TIME, YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY.
all RIGHT ???
do YOU THINK IS READY TO VOTE FOR A 4400?
well, I'M HOPING SO, BEING THERE'S A LOT MORE NON-4400s OUT THERE THAN PEOPLE WITH ABILITIES.
but MORE PEOPLE ARE TAKING THE SHOT ALL THE TIME.
how DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?
do YOU AGREE WITH JORDAN COLLIER'S DECISION TO HAND OUT PROMICIN TO ANYBODY WHO WANTS IT?
no. I DON'T.
half OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DIE.
thousands ALREADY HAVE.
are YOU CALLING JORDAN COLLIER A MASS MURDERER?
I THINK THAT JORDAN SHOULD'VE WAITED UNTIL THE ODDS OF SURVIVAL WERE BETTER THAN 50/50.
a LOT BETTER THAN 50/50.
if HE WANTED TO CHANGE THE WORLD, THERE ARE SAFER WAYS OF DOING SO.
like RUNNING FOR CITY COUNCIL?
well, THAT'S A START ANYWAY.
[DIANA]: APRIL, IT'S ME.
go AWAY.
not UNTIL WE'VE TALKED.
now JUST LET ME IN.
no.
come ON, OPEN UP.
so WHERE DO YOU GO NOW?
I REALLY HADN'T THOUGHT THAT FAR AHEAD.
I NEVER DO, DO I?
maybe THIS TIME YOU SHOULD.
you WANT TO HEAR SOMETHING FUNNY?
I THOUGHT WHEN I GOT THIS ABILITY, IT WOULD CHANGE MY LIFE.
and IT DID.
changed MY CIRCUMSTANCES ANYWAY.
I GOT BETTER CLOTHES.
I EAT IN BETTER RESTAURANTS.
fly FIRST-CLASS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE.
but IT DIDN'T CHANGE ME.
no ABILITY IS GOING TO DO THAT.
you HAVE TO CHANGE YOURSELF.
and YOU CAN.
how?
by MARCHING INTO NTAC?
that WOULD BE BRAVE.
except I'M NOT BRAVE, AM I?
another ONE OF MY MANY FAULTS.
it's NOT TOO LATE.
you CAN STILL BE THE PERSON THAT YOU WANT TO BE.
look, I CAN'T SAY THAT I APPROVE OF WHAT YOU'VE BEEN UP TO.
but YOU DID SAY THAT YOU LOVED THIS GUY, COLIN.
and IF YOU DID,
if THAT'S TRUE, THEN YOU HAVE TO SPEAK UP FOR HIM.
and ONLY YOU CAN DO THAT.
the MAN IS GUILTY OF MULTIPLE FELONIES
and HE'S THREATENING TO SUE US?
Mitchell's CLAIMING HARASSMENT, INTIMIDATION, OH, AND FALSE ARREST.
and ANEXXO'S LAWYERS HAVE THE MUSCLE TO MAKE A CASE LIKE THIS STICK.
come ON, MEGHAN.
he's RESPONSIBLE FOR ONE MURDER WE KNOW OF,
he PLOTTED TWO OTHERS,
and HIS CORPORATION IS TRYING TO DEFRAUD THE U. S. GOVERNMENT,
and WE'RE JUST GONNA LET HIM WALK?
Tom, YOU TELL ME THIS GUY DESERVES TO BE LOCKED UP AND I'LL BELIEVE YOU, BUT I NEED MORE THAN YOUR WORD.
I NEED THAT WOMAN, THE ONE THAT GOT HIS INITIAL CONFESSION.
look, I KNOW SHE'S PROMICIN POSITIVE,
but YOU NEED TO CONVINCE HER TO COME FORWARD.
Yeah, WELL, I DON'T THINK THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.
well, THEN THERE'S NO WAY WE'RE GOING TO GET AN INDICTMENT AGAINST MITCHELL.
not WITHOUT PROOF.
I HAVE THE PROOF YOU NEED RIGHT HERE.
everything ALL RIGHT?
no, IT'S NOT.
I'm DRIVING IN MY CAR,
turn ON THE RADIO,
and I HEAR YOU TELL THE WORLD THAT JORDAN COLLIER'S A MASS MURDERER.
that IS NOT WHAT I SAID.
I SAID THAT HE WAS WRONG TO HAND OUT PROMICIN.
and THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE.
everything THAT YOU ARE,
this BUILDING YOU'RE STANDING IN,
you OWE IT ALL TO JORDAN.
you're WILLING TO BETRAY HIM FOR SOME VOTES?
Hey, I BUILT THIS PLACE JUST AS MUCH AS JORDAN.
he USED MY HEALING ABILITIES TO RAISE MONEY FOR IT.
he USED ME FOR A LOT OF THINGS.
not ANYMORE.
I'm MY OWN MAN NOW.
I MAKE MY OWN CHOICES.
well, YOU'RE OFF TO A GREAT START.
you're NOT ONLY BETRAYING JORDAN, YOU'RE BETRAYING YOURSELF.
you're A TRAITOR, SHAWN.
don't YOU SEE THAT?
don't YOU SEE THAT?
traitor.
how LONG HAS IT BEEN?
since THE LAST TIME YOU ASKED, ABOUT 10 MINUTES.
since YOUR SISTER'S BEEN IN THERE WITH MITCHELL, ABOUT TWO HOURS.
Mitchell's BEEN WITH ANEXXO FOR WHAT, 14 YEARS?
imagine THE SECRETS HE'S SAVED UP.
we COULD BE HERE ALL NIGHT.
we GOT A SIGNED CONFESSION.
whether IT HOLDS UP IN COURT REMAINS TO BE SEEN,
but WE'VE GOT ENOUGH AGAINST HIM
that AT LEAST A COUPLE OF THESE CHARGES SHOULD STICK.
and APRIL? I'M SORRY, DIANA.
we HAVE TO TAKE HER INTO CUSTODY.
it's OKAY, DI.
everything's OKAY.
I ????
??? GO FOR IT EITHER.
you MUST'VE BEEN PRETTY CONVINCING.
excuse ME, I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
but I HAVE BEEN UP ALL NIGHT AND WHAT WE'RE DOING TO APRIL JUST ISN'T FAIR.
she DIDN'T HAVE TO COME FORWARD.
Mitchell COULD BE A FREE MAN RIGHT NOW, INSTEAD OF HAVING HIS PICTURE PLASTERED ALL OVER THE PAPERS.
she DID THE RIGHT THING, AND WE'RE LOCKING HER UP?
we NEED TO OFFER HER SOME KIND OF AMNESTY,
not PUNISH HER.
Skouris, WE'RE NOT PUNISHING HER.
we're HIRING HER.
according TO MEGHAN, NTAC...THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE...
they're ALREADY FIGHTING OVER WHO GETS ME WHEN.
and ALL I HAVE TO DO IS ASK PEOPLE QUESTIONS.
it's NOT ALWAYS GOING TO BE AT A BAR OVER DRINKS.
some OF THE PEOPLE YOU MEET AND THE QUESTIONS YOU HAVE TO ASK...
some OF THE ANSWERS YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR...
it CAN GET PRETTY UGLY.
meghan WAS PRETTY UPFRONT ABOUT THAT.
still, IT'S GOTTA BE BETTER THAN PRISON.
I MUST SAY, THE PERKS ARE PRETTY GOOD.
I GET AN APARTMENT,
a NICE SALARY, HEALTH INSURANCE,
even A CLOTHING ALLOWANCE.
and LET'S NOT FORGET ERIC AND RALPH.
or IS IT RALPH AND ERIC?
I'm SURE YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
their JOB IS TO MAKE SURE I SHOW UP WHEREVER I NEED TO BE.
knowing ME, IT WON'T BE AS EASY AS IT SOUNDS.
you THINK I'M GONNA SCREW THIS UP, DON'T YOU?
april, MAYBE THE QUESTION YOU SHOULD BE ASKING ME IS IF I WANT YOU TO SUCCEED,
and THE ANSWER IS A DEFINITE YES.
well, I'LL TRY NOT TO LET EITHER ONE OF US DOWN.
and I PROMISE TO CALL OR EMAIL
and LET YOU KNOW HOW I'M DOING.
so...
when ARE YOU LEAVING?
you KNOW, FOR SPAIN, OR WHEREVER YOU GUYS DECIDE?
I'm NOT LEAVING.
I'm STAYING RIGHT HERE IN SEATTLE.
did I JUST SAY THAT?
does BEN KNOW?
no. I HADN'T REALIZED IT UNTIL JUST NOW.
you're GONNA HAVE TO TELL HIM.
I'm REALLY HAPPY FOR BOTH OF YOU.
but WE'RE NOT LEAVING THIS TABLE UNTIL WE'VE MADE A DECISION.
are WE LIVING IN FRANCE OR SPAIN?
neither.
don't HATE ME, BEN. PLEASE.
Oh, GOD...
I QUIT WORK.
I WENT TO SPAIN.
I TRIED. I REALLY TRIED.
but I BELONG HERE.
with TOM, AND WITH NTAC, THE SEARCH FOR COLLIER.
I'm A PART OF THAT.
my DAUGHTER'S A PART OF THAT.
and NOW MY SISTER IS, TOO.
so WHAT HAPPENS TO US?
we GO BACK TO OUR OWN LIVES?
back TO OUR WORK?
what, SEE EACH OTHER A FEW DAYS A MONTH?
for NOW.
we COULD HAVE SO MUCH MORE, DIANA.
Maia SAID THAT WE'D GET MARRIED.
and MAIA'S NEVER WRONG.
well, I HOPE NOT.
me TOO.
the LAB REPORT YOU ASKED FOR.
the ONE AND ONLY COPY.
samples CAME BACK POSITIVE FOR PROMICIN.
someone's DEFINITELY WALKING AROUND WITH AN ABILITY.
Thanks, MARCO.
[KYLE]: "WHEN THE CHOSEN HAVE TAKEN THE ELIXIR "AND PROVED THEIR FAITH IN THE MESSIAH, "THEN ALL WILL FOLLOW IN THEIR WAKE.
only THEN WILL THE FATHER REVEAL HIS TRUE FACE, AND PARADISE AND THE WORLD WILL BE AS ONE.
I THINK THAT'S A PRETTY ACCURATE TRANSLATION.
the ELIXIR, THAT'S GOTTA BE PROMICIN.
and WE KNOW COLLIER'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE MESSIAH.
and THE FATHER?
I DON'T KNOW. GOD, I GUESS?
but WHO ARE THE CHOSEN?
flip THE PAGE.
it's A LIST OF NAMES.
Yeah. 200 IN ALL.
and MOST OF THEM YOU'LL RECOGNIZE.
politicians, SCIENTISTS, ATHLETES...
these PEOPLE, THEY'RE ALL ALIVE TODAY.
but THIS BOOK WAS WRITTEN 85 YEARS AGO.
I KNOW.
all RIGHT, SO ALL THESE PEOPLE HAVE TO TAKE THE SHOT?
and THAT'S SUPPOSED TO INFLUENCE MORE AND MORE PEOPLE TO DO THE SAME, RIGHT?
until WHAT?
everyone HAS AN ABILITY?
those WHO SURVIVE, ANYWAY.
and THAT'S WHEN GOD'S SUPPOSED TO SHOW UP?
I THINK YOU'D BETTER LOOK AT THE LAST NAME.
4400 were taken 4400 were returned each has a unique ability one among them has a message anyone can become extraordinary the risk is great but so are the rewards and now there's no truning back THE WORLD WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH US.
you're THE ALTERNATIVE WE NEED TO COLLIER AND HIS PROMICIN-PUSHING RADICALS.
does THAT MEAN YOU'LL RUN FOR CITY COUNCIL?
it MEANS I'M GOING TO RUN AND I'M GOING TO WIN.
promicin IS OUT THERE.
people ARE GAINING ABILITIES, AND NOTHING CAN BE DONE ABOUT THAT.
who's CASSIE?
I'm NOT WHAT YOU'D CALL REAL.
I'm KYLE'S ABILITY.
everything IN THAT BOOK IS GOING TO COME TRUE.
collier WILL LEAD THE HUMAN RACE TO SALVATION.
you WILL HELP HIM.
I've DONE BAD THINGS, AND I'M SUPPOSED TO DO MORE.
I WAS SENT TO HELP YOU GET AWAY.
this IS ALL HAPPENING FOR A REASON.
do YOU BELIEVE THAT JORDAN COLLIER IS A MESSIAH,
and THAT PROMICIN'S GOING TO SAVE THE WORLD?
Kyle, LISTEN TO ME,
if YOU'RE INVOLVED IN SOMETHING...
the LAB REPORT YOU ASKED FOR,
the SAMPLES CAME BACK POSITIVE FOR PROMICIN.
Hey, KYLE!
Hey, DAD, WHAT'S UP?
where ARE YOU, KYLE?
is SOMETHING WRONG?
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU, BUDDY.
it's IMPORTANT, BUT WE HAVE TO DO IT IN PERSON.
can YOU COME HOME NOW?
sure, YEAH.
I CAN BE HOME IN, LIKE, 20 MINUTES OR SOMETHING. WHAT'S WRONG?
20 MINUTES. I'LL BE HERE.
you CAN'T GO BACK THERE, KYLE.
he KNOWS.
knows WHAT?
what DO YOU THINK?
your FATHER KNOWS YOU TOOK THE PROMICIN SHOT.
what's HE GOING TO DO?
is HE GOING TO TELL NTAC?
if I CAN'T GO HOME, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
where DO I LIVE?
you CAN MOVE ON NOW.
move WHERE?
you're HEADING NORTH.
take HIGHWAY 99
until IT CROSSES WITH RURAL ROUTE 57.
follow THAT,
and YOU'LL FIND AN OLD LOGGING PASS.
when IT ENDS, GET OUT AND START WALKING DUE WEST.
what AM I LOOKING FOR?
go THERE.
enjoy THE SURPRISE.
I HEARD TALKING.
is EVERYTHING OKAY?
you HAVE TO GET READY, OKAY?
we're LEAVING.
don't LET THEM TAKE ME!
Oh, SWEETIE.
it's OKAY.
sweetheart, IT'S OKAY.
nobody's TAKING YOU ANYWHERE.
you JUST HAD A NIGHTMARE.
it's LIKE A PRISON.
all THE PEOPLE WITH ABILITIES ARE THERE.
they MAKE US LINE UP,
then THEY TAKE US AWAY,
someplace BAD.
what KIND OF PLACE?
you've HAD THIS DREAM BEFORE.
that WAS THE SECOND TIME.
I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO GO AWAY, BUT IT DIDN'T.
it's OKAY, SWEETIE.
come HERE.
it's OKAY, BABY.
what ARE WE EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING FOR?
we're IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.
Cassie SAID TO COME HERE.
that MEANS THERE'S SOMETHING HERE.
that CELL TOWER SERVICES THE ENTIRE AREA.
and YOU'RE POSITIVE THAT'S THE FINAL SIGNAL FROM MY SON'S PHONE?
all RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, THANKS.
God, JUST FOR ONCE I'D LIKE TO BEAT YOU IN HERE.
listen, I HAVE TO LEAVE FOR A WHILE.
Kyle's IN TROUBLE.
is HE? WHAT'S WRONG?
I CAN'T GET INTO IT, BUT I HAVE TO FIND HIM,
and I NEED YOU TO COVER FOR ME.
look, I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH KYLE'S WIRELESS CARRIER.
the LAST SIGNAL FROM HIS CELL PHONE CAME FROM ABOUT FOUR HOURS AWAY, SO IT COULD BE A WHILE.
maybe EVEN A DAY OR TWO.
well, TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG.
I'd LIKE TO HELP.
the BEST HELP YOU COULD GIVE ME IS TO COVER MY BACK.
tell ANYONE WHO ASKS THAT I'M IN THE FIELD ON ONE OF OUR CASES, ALL RIGHT?
okay.
I'll CALL YOU WHEN I FIND HIM.
good LUCK.
Thanks.
Oh, MY GOD.
Oh, MY GOD. YOU TRAPPED ME.
you LED ME RIGHT TO HIM.
how DID YOU FIND THIS PLACE?
I TOOK THE SHOT.
I've BEEN HAVING THESE VISIONS. THEY LED ME TO YOU.
they TOLD ME I HAVE TO BRING YOU SOMETHING.
Hey, IT'S JUST A BOOK, MAN.
all RIGHT, IT'S IMPORTANT.
it's ABOUT YOU.
you HAVE TO READ IT.
there WAS THIS RELIGIOUS MOVEMENT ABOUT 90 YEARS AGO.
white LIGHT, THEY CALLED IT A CULT.
this BOOK WAS THEIR PROPHECY.
it's ALL ABOUT PROMICIN, THE MOVEMENT.
it's THE REASON I'M SUPPOSED TO FIND YOU.
and HER?
were YOU SUPPOSED TO LEAD ISABELLE TYLER TO ME AS WELL?
I WAS GUIDED TO HER THE SAME WAY I WAS GUIDED TO YOU.
she's GOING TO HELP US WITH THE MOVEMENT, JORDAN.
I'm NOT A THREAT TO YOU.
I DON'T HAVE MY ABILITIES ANYMORE.
what COULD YOU POSSIBLY DO FOR ME?
I DON'T KNOW.
that's YOU.
I'm TELLING YOU, IT'S ALL ABOUT YOU.
bring THEM.
Mr. FARRELL HAS BEEN HANDED THIS REMARKABLE ABILITY, BUT HE HIMSELF IS SIMPLY NOT THAT DISTINGUISHED OF A YOUNG MAN.
now, EVEN IF HE WAS THE SECOND COMING I WOULD STILL SAY THAT A 4400 HAS NO BUSINESS RUNNING FOR PUBLIC OFFICE.
today's CLIPPINGS.
do I WANT TO READ TODAY'S CLIPPINGS?
everyone RESPECTS YOUR HEALING WORK, BUT THEY'RE CALLING YOU OUT ON YOUR AGE,
your INEXPERIENCE,
your LACK OF EDUCATION, YOUR CONNECTIONS WITH JORDAN COLLIER
I GET IT, I GET IT.
it's JUST, DO I REALLY HAVE TO STUDY MY OWN SHORTCOMINGS?
that's WHAT I WANT TO KNOW.
your CAMPAIGN MANAGER THINKS YOU DO.
she GOT YOU A MEETING WITH GABRIEL HEWITT LATER TODAY,
and YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO REFUTE HIS TALKING POINTS. ONE BY ONE.
I HAVE TO HAVE A SIT-DOWN WITH THE MAN THAT'S BEEN BADMOUTHING ME TO ANYBODY THAT WILL PUT A CAMERA IN HIS FACE?
I THINK THE IDEA IS TO WIN HIM OVER.
tell HIM ABOUT THE FOUNDATION.
convince HIM YOU ARE NOT SOME PAWN OF JORDAN COLLIER.
I ADMIRE YOU, KYLE.
given YOUR BACKGROUND, IT MUST HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO TAKE THE PROMICIN SHOT.
but I'VE READ YOUR BOOK.
it's WRONG.
I'm NO MESSIAH.
I KNOW HOW IT SOUNDS.
it WAS HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVE, TOO.
I'm NOBODY'S RELIGIOUS NUT,
but THESE VISIONS I HAVE ARE NEVER WRONG,
not ONCE,
and IF THEY SAY THAT BOOK IS IMPORTANT, I HAVE TO BELIEVE IT.
I HAVE TO BELIEVE WHAT'S IN THERE.
promicin ISN'T JUST HERE TO IMPROVE THE WORLD, JORDAN.
it's HERE TO BRING HEAVEN TO EARTH.
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS, BUT...
you're SUPPOSED TO MAKE IT HAPPEN, AND I'M SUPPOSED TO HELP YOU.
it's LIKE IT SAYS IN THE BOOK.
you ARE GOING TO LEAD US ALL TO GOD.
untie HIM.
we'll CONTINUE THIS SOMEWHERE MORE COMFORTABLE.
what ABOUT ME?
I'll DEAL WITH YOU SOON ENOUGH.
will WONDERS EVER CEASE?
I GUESS YOU DON'T GET MANY VISITORS HERE.
this TOWN ISN'T EVEN ON MY MAP.
that HIGHWAY TWO WENT IN A FEW YEARS BACK.
since THEN, WE'VE BEEN A LITTLE SHORT ON VISITORS, BUT IT'S A TREAT TO HAVE ONE AS HANDSOME AS YOU.
Kathy, WOULD YOU STOP FLIRTING WITH THE POOR MAN, SEE IF HE WANTS SOME LUNCH?
I'm GOOD.
Thanks.
you DON'T COME ALL THIS WAY TO SKIP MY FAMOUS APPLE PIE.
tell THE MAN, WILL YOU, SHANNON?
Kathy MAKES A MEAN APPLE PIE.
it's THE HOUSE SPECIALTY.
I'm SURE SHE DOES.
look, I WISH I HAD TIME.
actually, I WAS HOPING TO FIND THE SHERIFF.
there WAS A NOTE ON THE DOOR.
he SHOULD JUST MOVE HIS OFFICE IN HERE.
Thanks.
my SON'S DRIVING A GREEN SATURN.
well, THERE'S NOT MUCH REASON TO COME OUT HERE,
but IF I DO SEE IT,
I'll DEFINITELY GIVE YOU A CALL.
now, IF YOUR BOY DID PASS THROUGH HERE,
I'm SURE HE'S MOVED ON BY NOW.
but YOU'RE WELCOME TO HAVE A WANDER, ASK AROUND.
I APPRECIATE THAT, SHERIFF, THANKS.
not A PROBLEM.
is THERE ANYTHING WE CAN GET YOU FOR THE ROAD?
you SHOULD TRY THE PIE, MISTER.
it's REALLY GOOD.
I'll PASS, BUT THANKS.
you SURE?
Yeah.
Bye.
Bye.
so I GUESS THE QUESTION IS
are WE JUST TALKING ABOUT A KID'S RECURRING NIGHTMARE,
or IS IT SOMETHING WORSE?
well, OBVIOUSLY, I'M PULLING FOR NIGHTMARES.
Maia's VISIONS DON'T USUALLY HAPPEN WHILE SHE'S SLEEPING, AND SHE WASN'T SEEING THIS WHILE WE WERE IN SPAIN.
I MEAN, THE HEADLINES AREN'T EXACTLY REASSURING AND THEY'RE A LOT MORE IMMEDIATE WHEN YOUR MOM BRINGS YOU BACK TO THE FRONT LINES.
maybe SO, BUT WE CAN'T REALLY RULE OUT VISIONS EITHER, CAN WE?
Yeah, BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PRISON CAMPS.
Maia HASN'T BROKEN ANY LAWS.
she IS A 4400. SHE DIDN'T TAKE PROMICIN.
I'm AFRAID THAT DISTINCTION DOESN'T MEAN MUCH THESE DAYS.
people ARE SCARED.
a LOT OF THEM WANT TO LOCK UP EVERY P-POSITIVE OUT THERE.
the WRONG LEADER COMES TO POWER,
someone WHO EXPLOITS ALL THAT FEAR EVERYBODY'S FEELING,
and SUDDENLY THIS DOESN'T SEEM SO FARFETCHED.
there's A MORE PRODUCTIVE WAY TO LOOK AT THIS.
I MEAN, IF THEY ARE VISIONS,
at LEAST WE'VE GOT SOME WARNING.
you KNOW, IF WE HAD MORE SPECIFICS,
maybe WE CAN MAKE SURE THEY DON'T COME TRUE.
I'm TRYING TO STOP MY DAUGHTER FROM HAVING THESE NIGHTMARES, NOT ENCOURAGE HER TO HAVE MORE SPECIFIC ONES SO THAT YOU CAN ANALYZE THEM.
thanks FOR YOUR HELP, THOUGH.
excuse ME?
sorry, I DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE.
can I GET YOU SOMETHING?
Yeah, LOOK, I'M ON MY WAY OUT OF TOWN.
any CHANCE I CAN FILL UP?
your PUMPS DON'T SEEM TO BE WORKING.
I HAVEN'T HAD A GAS TRUCK AROUND IN A WHILE, BUT I THINK I GOT A SPARE GAS CAN IN THE BACK.
just GIVE ME A SEC?
Yeah.
what ARE YOU DOING, MISTER?
that's MY SON'S CAR. WHERE IS HE?
calm DOWN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
Where's KYLE?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, MAN!
now, YOU HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.
take YOUR HANDS OFF THAT MAN RIGHT NOW.
sheriff, THIS MAN HAS MY SON'S CAR.
tell HIM. TELL HIM!
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!
he's BEEN MESSING WITH THIS VEHICLE FOR MONTHS.
you SAID YOURSELF YOUR BOY JUST DROVE THROUGH HERE TODAY.
that's MY SON'S CAR, I KNOW IT IS.
now, LOOK, I AM SORRY FOR YOUR TROUBLES, MISTER, BUT YOU'RE WRONG, AND I DON'T THINK WE CAN HELP YOU HERE, SO MAYBE IT'S TIME YOU JUST MOVED ON, HUH?
starter's ON THE FRITZ.
give ME A HAND HERE?
you SHOULDN'T HAVE SEEN THAT, MISTER.
who ARE YOU PEOPLE? WHAT IS THIS PLACE?
you SAY YOU DECIPHERED THIS?
Isabelle DID.
it's A LIST OF NAMES,
but IT'S PEOPLE WHO ARE ALIVE TODAY.
politicians, RELIGIOUS LEADERS, SCIENTISTS.
the BOOK SAYS THAT ONCE THESE PEOPLE ALL TAKE PROMICIN, EVERYONE WILL.
it's LIKE A DOMINO EFFECT.
and THAT'S WHEN GOD COMES?
I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY, BUT...
only IF YOU TAKE THE BOOK LITERALLY.
I MEAN, "GOD" COULD MEAN ANY NUMBER OF THINGS.
if THESE PEOPLE SAW A WORLD HEALED BY PROMICIN,
they COULD HAVE INTERPRETED THAT AS HEAVEN.
I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN, THE ONLY WAY WE'LL KNOW IS IF WE JUST FOLLOW THE BOOK AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS, RIGHT?
we've ALLOWED THE GOVERNMENT TO CHARACTERIZE THE MOVEMENT AS A REVOLUTION.
revolutions DIVIDE, DESTABILIZE, SPREAD FEAR.
religions...
religions UNITE.
apparently THERE'S AN NTAC AGENT IN TOWN LOOKING FOR HIS SON.
my DAD KNOWS I TOOK THE SHOT.
he MUST HAVE TRACKED ME HERE.
he WOULD HAVE COME ON HIS OWN.
he's JUST LOOKING TO PROTECT ME, THAT'S IT.
jordan, BE CAREFUL WITH HIM, OKAY?
he's MY FATHER, AND...
he's THE LAST NAME ON THE LIST.
the BOOK SAYS YOUR FATHER HAS TO TAKE THE SHOT?
Yeah.
interesting.
so, THE APPLICATION PROCESS FOR THE HEALING FOUNDATION IS BLIND.
helps TO AVOID FAVORITISM,
and WE AVERAGE ABOUT A DOZEN TREATMENTS A DAY NOW.
well, THE WORK YOU DO HERE IS... REMARKABLE.
but THEN I ALREADY KNEW THAT.
well, DOES THAT MEAN YOU'RE GOING TO STOP SLINGING MUD AT ME?
quite THE CONTRARY.
I INTEND ON ATTACKING YOU
right UP UNTIL THE DAY OF THE ELECTION.
you SEEM TO BE TAKING THIS AS IF IT'S A REFERENDUM ON YOUR CHARACTER.
I ASSURE YOU THAT IT ISN'T.
personally, I THINK YOU'RE AN EXCEPTIONAL YOUNG MAN,
but THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT ARE AFRAID OF WHAT YOU REPRESENT, SO GOING AFTER YOU,
well, THAT'S JUST GOOD POLITICS.
so YOU DON'T THINK I'M A THREAT,
but YOU'RE GOING TO SAY THAT I AM ANYWAY?
you, UM...
you LOOK SO SHOCKED.
look, I HAVE MY EYE ON SOMETHING GREATER THAN JUST CITY COUNCIL.
when YOU DECLARED FOR THE RACE,
you BROUGHT THE NATIONAL MEDIA SPOTLIGHT WITH YOU,
and IF I DIDN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT, WELL...
I WOULDN'T BE MUCH OF A POLITICIAN, NOW, WOULD I?
don't MAKE A SOUND.
now OPEN THE DOOR.
open IT UP.
whatever YOU CAN DO, WHATEVER YOUR ABILITY IS, DON'T TRY TO USE IT.
I CAN'T HURT ANYBODY.
please, PUT THE GUN DOWN NOW.
what IS THIS PLACE?
what DID YOU PEOPLE DO TO THIS TOWN?
it WAS AN OLD TIMBER MILL TOWN.
it WAS ABANDONED YEARS AGO,
so WE CAME AND MADE IT OUR OWN.
who's WE?
all OF US.
everyone WHO LIVES HERE HAS TAKEN THE SHOT.
we JUST WANTED A PLACE WHERE WE COULD LIVE PEACEFULLY WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING ARRESTED.
that WON'T WORK HERE.
we HAVE SOMEONE WHO CAN DISRUPT ELECTRICAL SIGNALS.
what DID YOU DO TO MY SON?
nothing. HE CAME TO US.
he's SAFE.
he's BEING TAKEN CARE OF.
then TAKE ME TO HIM.
now.
no, I WOULDN'T SAY THAT MY MEETING WITH MR. FARRELL DID ANYTHING TO CONVINCE ME THAT A 4400 SHOULD HOLD PUBLIC OFFICE.
MAIA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP?
I'm NOT TIRED.
is THAT TRUE,
or ARE YOU JUST WORRIED ABOUT WHAT YOU MIGHT DREAM?
sweetie, IT'S OKAY TO BE SCARED.
you KNOW, YOU'RE UPSET,
and WE'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT OF CHANGES.
why ARE WE BACK HERE?
why DO I HAVE TO FIND A NEW SCHOOL?
and WHY IS BEN GONE?
well, SWEETIE
and WHY DO YOU ALWAYS CALL ME SWEETIE WHEN I GET UPSET?
I'm NOT A LITTLE KID ANYMORE.
no, OKAY, MAIA, YOU'RE RIGHT.
you're NOT A LITTLE KID, AND I UNDERSTAND IF YOU'RE MAD AT ME.
I MEAN, WE'VE MOVED AROUND A LOT,
but THIS CITY, AS SCARY AS IT CAN BE, IS THE ONE PLACE WHERE YOUR MOM CAN DO THE MOST GOOD, AND THAT'S IMPORTANT.
I TRIED TO PRETEND THAT IT WASN'T, AND I HOPE YOU'LL APPRECIATE THAT ONE DAY.
but, SWEETIE...
you CAN'T STAY UP FOREVER.
it'll ONLY MAKE YOU FEEL WORSE.
do YOU THINK I COULD HAVE THAT CAN?
here.
Hey, KYLE, YOU ALL RIGHT?
I'm FINE, THANKS, BUT I'M NOT KYLE.
collier, GET DOWN ON THE GROUND!
Hello, Tom.
welcome to my town.
that BACON SMELLS GOOD, HUH?
okay, SO TO MAKE SCRAMBLED EGGS...
do YOU WANT TO CRACK THE EGG?
Oh, I HOPE WE DIDN'T WAKE YOU.
we FIGURED YOU WOULD WANT TO SLEEP AFTER LAST NIGHT.
how DO YOU LIKE YOUR EGGS?
morning, TOM.
what DID YOU DO TO ME?
well, WE'VE TAKEN STEPS TO ENSURE THAT YOU BEHAVE YOURSELF WHILE YOU'RE OUR GUEST.
that BRACELET YOU'RE WEARING, -OUR TOWN MECHANIC CREATED THAT. -DALTON.
I BELIEVE YOU MET HIM.
it's QUITE A DEVICE.
it ALLOWS US TO TRACK YOU WHEREVER YOU GO.
and THAT...
that PAIN IN YOUR HEAD,
he DID THAT.
he's CAPABLE OF WORSE.
so, IF YOU BECOME VIOLENT WHILE YOU'RE HERE, OR MAKE ANY ATTEMPT TO LEAVE EVANSTON
Where's KYLE?
Kyle IS FINE.
we've BEEN TALKING.
he's A VERY BRAVE YOUNG MAN.
where IS HE? I WANT TO SEE HIM.
not YET.
Kyle AND I AGREE, YOU'RE NOT READY.
you DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE.
all RIGHT, THEN TELL ME, WHAT IS THIS PLACE?
it's A MODEL FOR A BETTER WORLD.
I GATHERED THESE PEOPLE.
they ALL TOOK THE SHOT AND LEFT THEIR OLD LIVES BEHIND.
they've CREATED SOMETHING BETTER HERE IN EVANSTON.
have A WALK AROUND.
see FOR YOURSELF.
Maia's DREAMING ABOUT GABRIEL HEWITT?
in HER NIGHTMARES, HE'S SOME KIND OF LEADER.
president, VICE PRESIDENT,
cabinet MEMBER, I DON'T KNOW, BUT HE SEEMS TO BE OVERSEEING SOME EXTREMELY REPRESSIVE MEASURES AGAINST THE 4400.
look, NOBODY RESPECTS YOUR DAUGHTER'S ABILITY MORE THAN I DO, AND I'M SORRY THAT SHE'S SEEING THESE THINGS, BUT HEWITT, HE'S ON THE SEATTLE CITY COUNCIL.
that's A LONG WAY AWAY FROM PULLING THESE KINDS OF STRINGS.
no, PLEASE UNDERSTAND, I THINK YOU'VE TAKEN A VERY BRAVE STEP BY DECLARING FOR PUBLIC OFFICE.
I MEAN, IT'S EXACTLY THE KIND OF GESTURE THIS COUNTRY NEEDS, BUT, I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER THAT YOU MAY INADVERTENTLY BE GIVING A PLATFORM ???
what ARE YOU ASKING ME TO DO? DROP OUT?
because THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
I'm NOT ASKING YOU TO DO ANYTHING.
I JUST WANT YOU TO HAVE THE FACTS.
but THESE AREN'T FACTS, THEY'RE DREAMS.
even IF THEY ARE VISIONS, I STOP THEM FROM HAPPENING BY STAYING IN THE RACE,
by TAKING A STAND AGAINST HATRED AND PROVING HEWITT WRONG.
I HOPE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS, BUT RIGHT NOW...
that's NOT WHAT MAIA'S SEEING.
we're NOT THE ENEMY, YOU KNOW.
we JUST THINK PEOPLE DESERVE A CHOICE.
I WAS IN A BAD PLACE WHEN I TOOK THE SHOT.
most OF US WERE.
but NOW I CAN DO SOMETHING WONDERFUL, SOMETHING NO ONE ELSE CAN.
what IS IT?
your ABILITY?
I GUESS YOU COULD CALL ME AN ANXIETY EXTRACTOR?
I TALK TO PEOPLE.
actually, THEY DO MOST OF THE TALKING,
but WHEN WE'RE DONE, THEY FEEL BETTER.
all THEIR WORRY'S JUST GONE.
what's THAT, LIKE A SOUPED-UP SHRINK?
I DON'T HAVE ANY ADVICE, BELIEVE ME,
but IT WORKS.
I TALKED TO JUST ABOUT EVERYBODY IN TOWN.
would YOU WANT TO TRY IT?
I DON'T THINK SO.
think OF IT AS A GOOD FAITH GESTURE.
you'd BE ONE STEP CLOSER TO SEEING YOUR SON.
Plus, NO OFFENSE...
but I THINK YOU COULD USE IT.
Kyle SAYS YOU'RE ESSENTIAL TO WHAT I'M DOING.
he's A VERY FORGIVING YOUNG MAN.
he WASN'T THERE WHEN YOU KILLED 4400s.
why SHOULDN'T I BE RID OF YOU FOREVER?
I DON'T KNOW.
I'm NOT IN THAT BOOK,
but WHEN I FIRST GOT OLDER, I WAS TOLD I EXISTED TO STOP THE 4400,
and THAT'S WHAT I TRIED TO DO.
you BEAT ME.
I THOUGHT I'D SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE IN PRISON, THINKING ABOUT WHAT I'D DONE,
and THEN KYLE FOUND ME.
he TOLD ME I HAVE A PURPOSE.
he TOLD ME I COULD STILL BE GOOD.
you HAVE NO IDEA
how MUCH I WANT THAT TO BE TRUE.
so IF HELPING YOU IS THE WAY TO MAKE MY LIFE MEAN SOMETHING,
I WANT TO TRY.
if I ACCEPT WHAT KYLE SAYS ABOUT OUR MOVEMENT,
I HAVE TO ACCEPT WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT YOU, BUT THE FIRST MOMENT YOU MAKE ME NERVOUS, YOUR INVITATION IS RESCINDED, AND YOU CAN GUESS WHAT THAT MEANS.
cut HER DOWN.
every MOVE I MAKE,
it SEEMS LIKE THERE'S SOME KIND OF LOSS THAT COMES WITH IT,
and THE WOMAN I LOVE IS GONE,
I'm LOSING MY SON TO COLLIER, AND I...
are YOU DONE?
how DO YOU FEEL?
wow, I ACTUALLY FEEL BETTER.
it's NOT PERMANENT.
we WOULD NEED TO HAVE FOLLOW-UP TALKS.
it...
what IS THIS?
whenever I TALK TO SOMEONE, AT THE END, THERE'S ONE OF THESE.
I THINK IT REPRESENTS ALL OF THE BAD STUFF INSIDE OF YOU.
the FEAR, ANXIETY...
you SHOULD KEEP IT.
a LITTLE REMINDER OF WHAT WE DO HERE.
Kathy, YOU WEREN'T LYING.
this PIE IS DELICIOUS.
Yeah, THE PIE'S PRETTY GOOD,
but THE AFTERTASTE IS A KILLER.
aftertaste? WHAT AFTERTASTE?
you'll SEE.
he's GETTING SCARED.
Shannon, TELL HIM IT'S OKAY.
it's ALL RIGHT, TOM.
just RELAX.
the PIE HAD A LITTLE SOMETHING IN IT.
whoa, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHAT DO YOU MEAN SOMETHING?
what SOMETHING? WHAT SOMETHING?
courtesy OF ONE OF OUR RESIDENTS.
after WE TAKE IT, WE SHARE ONE MIND.
we CAN SEE EACH OTHER'S MEMORIES.
it's HOW WE KNOW EACH OTHER BETTER.
it's AMAZING, IF YOU JUST RELAX.
this WAS BILLY'S LAST BIRTHDAY, BEFORE HIS PARENTS WERE KILLED IN A PLANE CRASH.
that's PAUL AND KATHY.
they WERE SO CUTE WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG.
he POPPED THE QUESTION AFTER THREE WEEKS.
he SAID HE JUST KNEW.
they CAN'T SEE US?
we're NOT EVEN REALLY HERE.
it's JUST A MEMORY.
I've NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE.
this IS ME.
Oh, MY GOD, THAT'S ME.
we WON THE LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP THAT YEAR.
my FATHER ACTUALLY CAME TO THE GAME.
hey...
I, UH...
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
another SATISFIED CUSTOMER.
that WAS AMAZING.
you KNOW, I FEEL LIKE I KNOW YOU ALL NOW.
it's PRETTY INTENSE, ISN'T IT?
I'm JUST GLAD YOU FINALLY ACCEPTED THE INVITATION.
Yeah, ME TOO.
I'm GLAD YOU GOT TO SPEND SOME TIME IN THIS PLACE.
these PEOPLE, THEY'RE NOT EVIL.
they're JUST LOOKING TO MAKE A BETTER LIFE FOR THEMSELVES, AND THEY DID.
how COULD YOU TAKE THE SHOT?
how COULD YOU RISK YOUR LIFE LIKE THAT?
it WAS WORTH IT, DAD.
it BROUGHT ME HERE.
in A WEIRD WAY, IT BROUGHT US TOGETHER.
I KNOW OUR RELATIONSHIP HAS ALWAYS BEEN COMPLICATED, BUT THIS PLACE IS SIMPLE.
it's GOOD, DAD.
and THE LIFE THEY'RE LIVING HERE, DAD,
that COULD BE OUR LIFE.
we COULD LIVE HERE, YOU AND ME.
isn't THAT WHAT YOU WANT?
for US TO BE TOGETHER?
of COURSE.
more THAN ANYTHING.
if YOU WANT TO STAY HERE,
if YOU WANT TO LIVE HERE WITH ME...
you HAVE TO TAKE THE SHOT.
Kyle, YOU KNOW I CAN'T DO THAT.
are YOU AFRAID OF DYING, DAD?
because I PROMISE YOU, IF YOU TAKE THE SHOT, YOU WILL LIVE.
how COULD YOU KNOW THAT?
everybody HERE HAS AN ABILITY.
so DO I.
I CAN'T TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW,
but I KNOW THAT YOU'LL BE OKAY.
I KNOW THAT'S A LOT TO TAKE IN RIGHT NOW.
you DON'T HAVE TO GIVE ME AN ANSWER RIGHT AWAY.
just SLEEP ON IT.
I KNOW I HAVEN'T SAID THIS TO YOU IN A LONG TIME,
but I LOVE YOU.
do YOU THINK HE'LL DO IT?
part OF HIM WANTS TO.
I COULD SEE IT IN HIS EYES.
he KNOWS THIS PLACE IS GOOD, BUT HIS WHOLE LIFE HAS JUST BEEN ABOUT DUTY.
the FBI, NTAC.
I'm NOT SURE HE'LL BE ABLE TO JUST TURN HIS BACK ON ALL THAT.
and IF HE SAYS NO?
his NAME'S IN THE BOOK, RIGHT?
that's PRETTY MUCH A GUARANTEE THAT HE CAN SURVIVE THE SHOT.
can WE JUST MAKE HIM TAKE IT?
I've NEVER FORCED ANYONE TO TAKE PROMICIN.
the MOVEMENT'S ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT CHOICE.
but YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR FATHER, IT'S INTRICATE...
so IF YOU THINK IT BEST TO GIVE HIM THE SHOT, I'LL RESPECT YOUR DECISION.
so IF I STAY IN THE RACE, I'M CREATING A MONSTER.
you DON'T KNOW THAT FOR SURE.
remember, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DREAMS.
no, THESE AREN'T JUST DREAMS.
this GIRL PREDICTED THAT JORDAN WOULD BE SHOT.
she CAN TELL THE FUTURE, AND HEWITT SAID IT HIMSELF WHEN HE WAS HERE.
he's USING ME TO GET ATTENTION FOR HIS CAREER.
I CAN'T JUST SIT ON THIS.
I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.
if JORDAN FOUND OUT THAT SOME GUY WAS RISING TO POWER ON HIS BACK, AND HE COULD BECOME SOME KIND OF HOME-GROWN HITLER, HE WOULDN'T JUST SIT AROUND WRINGING HIS HANDS.
he'd ACT.
good MORNING, TOM.
you're DONATING PROMICIN?
every WEEK.
we ALL DO.
I HATE NEEDLES, BUT JORDAN'S GIVEN US ALL SO MUCH.
we FIGURE THE LEAST WE CAN DO
is GIVE SOMETHING BACK.
I RIGGED UP THIS MACHINE HERE.
you WANT TO SEE HOW IT WORKS?
no.
I'm GLAD I SAW THIS PLACE.
I KNOW HOW MUCH IT MEANS TO YOU, AND FOR THE FIRST TIME, I FEEL LIKE MAYBE I UNDERSTAND WHAT COLLIER'S TRYING TO DO.
Yeah.
but I CAN'T BE A PART OF IT.
you're JUST HOLDING ONTO THIS IDEA OF YOURSELF AS OUR OPPONENT, OUR ENEMY.
you CAN JUST LET GO OF THAT.
it'd BE SO EASY.
it's NOT ABOUT THAT, KYLE.
this TOWN, IT'S LIKE A LITTLE UTOPIA,
but IT EXISTS TO SEND PROMICIN OUT INTO THE STREETS, AND NO MATTER HOW YOU LOOK AT IT,
half THE PEOPLE WHO TAKE THAT SHOT ARE GOING TO DIE, AND I CAN'T LIVE WITH THAT.
you HAVE TO.
we ALL HAVE TO, DAD.
forget 50-50, OKAY?
if THE MOVEMENT DOESN'T SUCCEED, NOBODY HAS ANY CHANCE.
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.
I CAN'T.
I GET IT.
you HAVE TO FOLLOW WHAT YOU BELIEVE, AND SO DO I.
no, WAIT, KYLE.
you ARE THE ONLY THING THAT COULD TEMPT ME TO DO THIS.
I LOVE YOU.
get OUT OF MY WAY.
I'm LEAVING.
I'm SORRY YOU'VE DECLINED OUR INVITATION, TOM.
I'm SORRY YOUR LACK OF FAITH WILL COST YOU YOUR SON.
I'm WALKING AWAY.
you GO AHEAD AND GIVE ME A STROKE
if YOU HAVE TO, BUT I'M WALKING OUT OF THIS TOWN.
you KNOW I CAN'T LET YOU DO THAT.
no. NO...
No!
I TOLD YOU.
I'm NOT TAKING THE SHOT!
No!
no... NO!
No! NO!
No! NO! NO! NO...
it's NOT JUST ABOUT THE POLITICS, IS IT?
what THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE?
everything THAT YOU SAID TO ME IN MY OFFICE THAT DAY WAS A LIE.
this IS PRIVATE PROPERTY.
you KNOW THAT I COULD HAVE YOU ARRESTED FOR TRESPASSING.
the TRUTH IS YOU HATE US ALL.
you HATE ALL THE 4400.
so WHAT IF I DO?
I MEAN, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?
now, I'LL ASK YOU AGAIN, WHY ARE YOU HANGING AROUND OUTSIDE MY GARAGE?
what ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I WANTED TO SEE YOU WITHOUT THE CAMERAS WHEN YOU PUT YOUR PUBLIC FACE UP FOR THE NIGHT,
have A LOOK AT YOUR EYES.
I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE CAPABLE OF TERRIBLE THINGS, AND THAT YOU HAVE AN EVIL LIVING INSIDE OF YOU.
what IF YOU DID SEE EVIL?
then WHAT?
honestly, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO,
but THE TRUTH IS, I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.
you MAY BE FULL OF FEAR AND HATRED,
but YOU'RE JUST A MAN.
for NOW.
listen, YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW IT YET.
you WOULDN'T MAKE A VERY GOOD LEADER.
I'm NOT GOING TO LET YOU BECOME ONE.
but YOUR PROMICIN TEST CAME BACK NEGATIVE.
Yeah.
I'm SO SORRY ABOUT KYLE, TOM.
we NEED TO CALL MEGHAN, ISSUE A NEW APB.
jordan COLLIER, HIS FOLLOWERS...
and MY SON.
I COULDN'T FORCE HIM TO TAKE IT, JORDAN.
I'm SORRY.
well, I LEFT THE CHOICE UP TO YOU.
anyway, THE SEDATIVE WE GAVE HIM GAVE US ENOUGH TIME TO GET OUT OF EVANSTON.
but HE'S GONE. I LOST MY DAD.
we LOST MY DAD.
his NAME IS IN THE BOOK.
if HE DOESN'T TAKE THE SHOT, WE DON'T SUCCEED.
then YOU NEED TO HAVE FAITH HE WILL.
but IT WON'T HAPPEN BECAUSE WE FORCED IT ON HIM.
one DAY, KYLE, I BELIEVE YOUR FATHER WILL COME TO US.
we LOST EVANSTON BECAUSE OF ME.
I COST US PARADISE.
it's ALL RIGHT.
Evanston WAS NEVER MEANT AS A PERMANENT SETTLEMENT.
it WAS ONLY A...
a DRESS REHEARSAL FOR PARADISE.
so WHAT DO WE DO NOW?
you've GOT ALL THESE PEOPLE HERE.
what ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THEM?
the WORLD WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH US.
[MAIA]: I'M NOT TIRED.
are YOU WORRIED ABOUT WHAT YOU MIGHT DREAM?
[TOM]: WHO'S CASSIE?
[CASSIE]: I'M KYLE'S ABILITY.
[TOM]: THEY DID SOMETHING TO ME LAST NIGHT.
[DREW IMROTH]: WHEN WE NEED HIM, HE'LL BE THERE FOR US.
they PUT SOMETHING INTO ME.
Where's KYLE?
Kyle AND I AGREE, YOU'RE NOT READY.
you DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE.
all RIGHT, THEN TELL ME, WHAT IS THIS PLACE?
it's A MODEL FOR A BETTER WORLD.
they're JUST LOOKING TO MAKE A BETTER LIFE FOR THEMSELVES, AND THEY DID.
promicin ISN'T JUST HERE TO IMPROVE THE WORLD.
it's HERE TO BRING HEAVEN TO EARTH.
you're SUPPOSED TO MAKE IT HAPPEN, AND I'M SUPPOSED TO HELP YOU.
you ARE GOING TO LEAD US ALL TO GOD.
so, WHAT DO WE DO NOW?
we're GOING TO SEATTLE.
everyone's WAITING.
these ARE GOOD PEOPLE.
loyal.
they BELIEVE IN THIS NEW WORLD I'VE PROMISED THEM.
it's NOT JUST A PROMISE.
it's GOING TO HAPPEN...
starting TODAY.
once WE TAKE THIS STEP,
there IS NO GOING BACK.
I NEED YOU TO TELL ME, KYLE, THAT NO MATTER THE COST, NO MATTER THE SACRIFICE, THIS WILL ALL BE WORTH IT.
you KNOW IT'S WORTH IT, JORDAN.
this IS THE RIGHT TIME.
this IS THE RIGHT PLACE.
if YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT, WE WOULDN'T BE IN SEATTLE.
let's GO CHANGE THE WORLD.
we BELIEVE IN YOU, JORDAN.
he's HERE!
three YEARS AGO, 4400 MISSING PEOPLE, EACH WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY ABILITY,
reappeared IN A BALL OF LIGHT, AND THE WORLD WONDERED WHY.
six MONTHS AGO, THE PROMICIN SHOT MADE THOSE ABILITIES ACCESSIBLE TO ANYONE WITH THE COURAGE TO TAKE IT, AND AGAIN, THE WORLD WONDERED WHY.
today, WE TELL THEM WHY.
today, WE ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS, AND AFTER TODAY, THE WORLD WILL NEVER BE THE SAME.
I'm SO SORRY.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME.
those NOODLES WERE SO OVERCOOKED.
Diana, STOP APOLOGIZING.
that's THE FIRST MEAL I'VE HAD IN MONTHS
that DIDN'T COME OUT OF A MICROWAVE OR A TAKE-OUT CARTON.
all THESE YEARS WE'VE BEEN PARTNERS, AND I HAVEN'T HAD YOU OVER FOR DINNER, AND...
you NEVER FELT THIS SORRY FOR ME BEFORE.
what?
look, WHEN A WOMAN INVITES A MAN OVER FOR DINNER, IT'S FOR ONE OF TWO REASONS, ATTRACTION, OR PITY, AND I'M PUTTING MY MONEY ON PITY.
well, BETWEEN ALANA AND KYLE,
you HAVE HAD A TOUGH RUN OF IT LATELY.
me TOO.
I FIGURED THERE'S NOTHING LIKE OVERCOOKED PASTA TO START THE HEALING PROCESS.
you KNOW, NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU RUB THAT MOLE, IT'S NOT GOING TO GO AWAY.
you're RIGHT.
it's JUST A MOLE.
I MEAN, I'M STILL ME.
I'm NOT ONE OF THE MARKED, OR WHATEVER.
no, I NEVER SAID YOU WERE.
this JOB CAN MESS WITH YOUR HEAD, HUH?
Yeah.
speaking OF WORK, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MEGHAN?
mm, SHE'S DIFFERENT.
you KNOW, FROM WHAT YOU'D EXPECT FOR A BOSS.
that's A LITTLE NONCOMMITTAL.
have YOU NOT NOTICED? I THINK SHE'S A LITTLE...
a LITTLE FOCUSED ON YOU.
what?
focused ON ME?
mom, JORDAN COLLIER.
he's ABOUT TO DO SOMETHING.
something BIG.
you SAW HIM?
did YOU HAVE A VISION?
sweetie, WHERE IS HE?
he's HERE, IN SEATTLE.
Kyle's WITH HIM.
he's RIGHT HERE.
okay, MAIA, I'VE IMPORTED YOUR DRAWING INTO A GRAPHICS FILE.
now WE CAN MAKE ANY CHANGES YOU WANT.
you KNOW, GET IT CLOSER TO WHAT YOU SAW.
the REDS,
they SHOULD BE A LITTLE DARKER, ESPECIALLY AROUND THE MIDDLE.
MAIA, ARE YOU SURE THIS REPRESENTS SOME PART OF SEATTLE?
the PICTURE HAD SOME KIND OF LINES UNDER THE COLORS.
like THAT?
there's A DEFINITE PATTERN HERE.
maybe IT'S AN ELEVATION STUDY?
red FOR PEAKS, AND BLUE AND GREEN FOR LOWER ELEVATIONS.
Yeah, AND IT COULD BE A POPULATION SURVEY, A STUDY OF HOMES OF MEDIAN INCOME.
ethnic, RELIGIOUS GROUPINGS.
well, THAT NARROWS IT DOWN.
actually, IT DOES.
all THOSE THINGS REQUIRE COMPREHENSIVE DATA ANALYSES, AND THOSE DON'T COME CHEAP.
which MEANS A BIG CORPORATE OR A GOVERNMENT STUDY.
Yeah, WHAT, D.O.D.
N.S.A. CENSUS BUREAU.
odds ARE, THIS IMAGE IS SITTING IN A GOVERNMENT COMPUTER SOMEWHERE, WHICH MEANS I CAN FIND IT.
you DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE.
I DIDN'T WANT TO OVERSTAY MY WELCOME.
listen, I HOPE YOU'RE OKAY WITH EVERYTHING.
I DIDN'T REALLY PLAN ON...
more THAN DINNER AND A MOVIE?
it's JUST, THESE LAST FEW DAYS HAVE BEEN GREAT, BUT YOUR MOM IS A CLIENT, OR SHE WAS A CLIENT.
you MAKE IT SOUND LIKE YOU WERE HER LAWYER.
my MOTHER HAD STAGE FOUR LEUKEMIA.
you SAVED HER LIFE.
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK THAT I MAKE A HABIT OUT OF SLEEPING WITH THE PEOPLE THAT I HELP.
I KNOW THAT.
I'd STAY.
I JUST HAVE THIS APPOINTMENT
first THING IN THE MORNING.
all RIGHT.
I'll CALL YOU.
I GUESS THAT ANSWERS MY QUESTION.
I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU IF YOU WERE SURE
you WANTED TO BE A PART OF THIS OPERATION.
believe ME, I WANT COLLIER CAUGHT AS MUCH AS ANYONE.
it's NOT COLLIER I WAS THINKING ABOUT.
it's YOUR SON.
look, THE ONLY THING WE HAVE ON KYLE
is TAKING PROMICIN.
I CAN STILL HELP HIM CUT A DEAL, GET HIM ON THE INHIBITOR,
but THE LONGER HE'S WITH COLLIER, THE HARDER IT'S GOING TO BE FOR ME TO HELP HIM.
are YOU SURE HE WANTS TO BE HELPED?
he's MY SON.
I've GOT TO BELIEVE I CAN STILL REACH HIM.
I'm SORRY.
I KNOW.
it's A TOXICOLOGY STUDY.
I GOT IT FROM THE EPA.
the RED AREAS INDICATE A HIGH LEVEL OF POLLUTION, PINK A LITTLE LESS,
and THEN ALL THE WAY TO GREEN, WHICH
Marco, DO YOU KNOW WHERE COLLIER IS?
Yeah.
the DUWAMISH RIVER DELTA. SOUTH SEATTLE.
one OF THE MOST POLLUTED PLACES IN THE COUNTRY.
we're TALKING OLD REFINERIES, DEAD END STREETS,
and ROTTING FACTORIES.
so, NOT A NICE PLACE.
unless YOU WANT TO HIDE, AND THEN IT'S PERFECT.
that PLACE IS A MAZE.
it COULD TAKE DAYS TO DO A COMPLETE SEARCH.
then YOU BETTER GET STARTED,
because ACCORDING TO WHAT MAIA'S TOLD US, WHATEVER JORDAN COLLIER'S PLANNING,
this IS GROUND ZERO.
Bobby, HEAD THAT WAY.
we're GOING TO COVER THIS SIDE.
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY COLLIER WOULD RISK COMING BACK TO SEATTLE.
it's LIKE HE'S DARING US TO CATCH HIM.
well, WE WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW HE WAS HERE IF IT WEREN'T FOR MAIA.
it's NOT LIKE HE'S SHOWED UP AT A MARINERS GAME.
this PLACE IS PRETTY LOW PROFILE.
I DON'T THINK THIS QUALIFIES AS LOW PROFILE.
somebody's FEELING PRETTY CONFIDENT.
Tom, WHAT ARE THOSE LIGHTS?
it's ALMOST LIKE THEY'RE MARKING
some KIND OF PERIMETER.
maybe THEY'RE WARNING LIGHTS,
an ALARM SYSTEM.
I'm CALLING FOR BACK-UP.
this IS SKOURIS.
we NEED HELP DOWN AT DUWAMISH DELTA.
Tom, WHAT?
get BACK!
well, WE WON'T BE DOING THAT AGAIN.
senator LENHOFF IS HERE.
senator, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE IN TOWN.
come TO SAY HELLO TO YOUR FAVORITE FUTURE COUNCILMAN?
actually, I'M HERE TO RUIN YOUR MORNING.
sex FOR MIRACLES?
it's ALL OVER THE NET.
every ANTI-4400 WINGNUT IS RUNNING WITH IT.
this SAYS THAT I FORCED KARA TO HAVE SEX WITH ME
in EXCHANGE FOR HEALING HER MOTHER.
you KNOW THIS GIRL?
I DIDN'T EXCHANGE SEX FOR MIRACLES, OKAY?
or FOR ANYTHING ELSE, FOR THAT MATTER.
but YOU SLEPT WITH HER?
she ASKED ME OUT TO DINNER.
we WENT OUT ON A DATE. WE HAD A REALLY GOOD TIME.
we WENT ON A COUPLE MORE DATES. I LIKE THIS GIRL.
Farrell, DID YOU OR DID YOU NOT HAVE SEX WITH THIS WOMAN?
last NIGHT.
and IT HITS THE NET THIS MORNING.
what DOES THAT TELL YOU?
you THINK THIS IS SOME KIND OF SET-UP?
I'll HAVE MY PEOPLE START DIGGING.
it SHOULD BE EASY ENOUGH TO DISCREDIT HER.
a GIRL LIKE THIS,
there's ALWAYS SOMETHING.
senator,
let's HOLD OFF ON THE CHARACTER ASSASSINATION
until I AT LEAST TALK TO KARA.
okay?
you WANT TO PLAY NICE, GIVE IT A TRY,
but IF THIS GIRL'S WHO I THINK SHE IS,
tomorrow WE COME OUT SWINGING.
these LIGHTS, OR BEACONS OR WHATEVER.
they MUST'VE BEEN BUILT BY ONE OF JORDAN'S FOLLOWERS.
they EXTEND FROM HERE ALL THE WAY TO THE RIVER.
they WALL OFF ABOUT A SQUARE MILE OF BUILDINGS
right IN THE MOST TOXIC PART OF THE DELTA.
we CALLED IN SEATTLE P. D.
and THE GUARD.
no ONE'S GETTING IN OR OUT WITHOUT US KNOWING IT.
so COLLIER'S BACKED HIMSELF INTO A CORNER.
Yeah, ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET PAST THESE LIGHTS
I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO SEE THIS.
for TOO LONG, THOSE OF US WITH SPECIAL GIFTS, AND THOSE WHO'VE TAKEN PROMICIN, HAVE HAD TO CONCEAL AND EVEN NEGLECT THEIR ABILITIES.
well, I STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY TO TELL YOU THE TIME FOR HIDING IS OVER,
and THAT THE TIME FOR MIRACLES HAS BEGUN,
and IT STARTS RIGHT HERE.
today, WE CLAIM THIS GODFORSAKEN PIECE OF EARTH OURS.
did THIS GUY JUST SAY
he's ANNEXING PART OF SEATTLE?
it SOUNDED LIKE THAT.
...to MAKE IT WHOLE AGAIN.
using OUR ABILITIES, WE WILL HEAL ITS TOXIC SOIL.
we WILL CLEANSE ITS POLLUTED WATERS,
and WE WILL TURN THIS BLIGHTED PLACE
into A GARDEN.
for THOSE WILLING TO JOIN US,
we WELCOME YOU.
all YOU NEED IS AN ABILITY, AND THE WILLINGNESS TO BECOME PART OF A MIRACLE,
but THE BLESSINGS WE BRING
will NOT JUST BE LIMITED TO THIS SMALL PLACE,
because THIS IS THE BEGINNING
of A MUCH WIDER AND DEEPER HEALING.
because THE MIRACLES WE WORK HERE,
we INTEND TO WORK EVERYWHERE.
help US, WORK WITH US, AND TOGETHER, WE CAN TRANSFORM THIS WORLD INTO A PARADISE.
Yeah, ASSUMING YOU TAKE PROMICIN AND SURVIVE.
for THOSE OF YOU UNWILLING TO JOIN US, ALL WE ASK IS THAT YOU LEAVE US IN PEACE.
if YOU INSIST ON INTERFERING,
if YOU THREATEN US, OR IN ANY WAY ATTACK US,
there WILL BE CONSEQUENCES, IMMEDIATE, AND SEVERE.
but I DID NOT COME TO INTIMIDATE.
this IS A MESSAGE OF HOPE, FOR A BETTER TOMORROW,
for A NEW WORLD, AND IT BEGINS HERE, IN THIS...
city OF HOPE.
it STARTS HERE,
in PROMISE CITY.
I'd HATE TO HAVE HER JOB.
jordan COLLIER GRABS A CHUNK OF SEATTLE
as HIS OWN PERSONAL FIEFDOM UNDER HER WATCH.
not GOING TO EARN HER ANY BROWNIE POINTS IN D. C.
no ONE COULD HAVE SEEN THAT COMING.
Tom, WE'VE GOT ANOTHER.
it's AN EARTHQUAKE IN THE ALLEGHENY MOUNTAINS, JUST OUTSIDE OF PITTSBURGH.
5. 2 ON THE RICHTER SCALE.
miles FROM THE NEAREST FAULT LINE.
a TORNADO OUTSIDE PALM SPRINGS, A WAREHOUSE EXPLOSION IN JERSEY, A TSUNAMI ON LAKE MICHIGAN.
now THIS? ANYONE HURT?
no, JUST LIKE THE OTHERS, PROPERTY DAMAGE, BUT NO INJURIES.
any CLOSER TO THE CITY, THOUGH, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT.
collier's MADE A STATEMENT ON THE NET.
he's CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL THESE MINI-DISASTERS.
he's CALLING THEM DEMONSTRATIONS.
just LETTING US KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN
if WE MOVE AGAINST HIM.
I MEAN, GOD KNOWS HOW MANY PEOPLE HE HAS WITH ABILITIES, SCATTERED AROUND THE COUNTRY JUST WAITING FOR HIS SIGNAL.
Hey, DAD.
Hey, KYLE, YOU OKAY?
Yeah, I'M FINE.
all RIGHT, GOOD. NOW, HERE'S WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO.
you GO TO THE PERIMETER, YOU WALK ACROSS, AND YOU SURRENDER TO THE FIRST NTAC AGENT YOU SEE.
dad, I'M WHERE I NEED TO BE.
things COULD GET REALLY UGLY DOWN THERE.
you NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN.
promise CITY HAS TO SUCCEED. EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON IT.
is THAT WHAT JORDAN COLLIER'S BEEN TELLING YOU?
actually, THAT'S WHAT I'M TELLING HIM.
you're SOME KIND OF ADVISOR TO HIM NOW?
something LIKE THAT.
then ADVISE HIM TO END THIS THING RIGHT NOW!
I CAN'T DO THAT, OKAY?
I KNOW THIS IS COMING AT YOU REALLY FAST, BUT YOU GOT TO HEAR ME OUT.
there's THIS BOOK. IT'S A PROPHECY.
this ABILITY THAT I HAVE LED ME TO IT.
this ABILITY OF YOURS.
you STILL HAVEN'T TOLD ME WHAT IT IS.
it's COMPLICATED.
it TELLS ME WHAT TO DO.
what's IMPORTANT, AND THIS BOOK IS IMPORTANT, DAD.
I MEAN, IT'S ALMOST 100 YEARS OLD, BUT IT TALKS ABOUT THE 4400, PROMICIN, EVERYTHING, AND DAD, IT EXPLAINS WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN FOR PARADISE TO COME TO EARTH,AND PROMISE CITY'S WHERE IT ALL STARTS.
once PEOPLE SEE WHAT WE CAN DO HERE, THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TO BE A PART OF IT,
and ONCE THAT HAPPENS, ACCORDING TO THE BOOK,
once EVERYONE'S TAKEN PROMICIN...
I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO SAY IT.
God IS GOING TO SHOW HIS FACE.
it'll BE HEAVEN ON EARTH.
are YOU STILL THERE?
Yeah, I'M HERE.
wait...
Kyle, THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
if EVERYONE IN THE WORLD TAKES THIS SHOT,
half OF THEM ARE GOING TO DIE.
you're TALKING PARADISE AT THE COST OF GENOCIDE.
dad, THE WORLD IS FALLING APART.
okay, PROMISE CITY HAS TO SUCCEED.
you CAN'T LET THEM DESTROY IT.
listen, KYLE, JUST...
can WE JUST...
can WE TALK IN PERSON?
I MEAN, COME HOME.
I AM HOME, DAD.
I'll TALK TO YOU SOON.
Shawn, I THOUGHT YOU WERE SMARTER THAN THIS.
I MEAN, ARE YOU REALLY THAT SURPRISED?
I SAVED YOUR MOTHER'S LIFE
and I WILL ALWAYS BE GRATEFUL FOR THAT.
my MOTHER WAS SICK FOR THREE YEARS.
my PARENTS WENT THROUGH THEIR ENTIRE LIFE SAVINGS.
they GAVE ME ENOUGH MONEY TO GET MY PARENTS OUT OF DEBT
and START A LIFE FOR MYSELF, TOO.
they? WHO'S THEY?
lawyers.
from BACK EAST, I THINK.
look, ALL I KNOW IS THAT THEY PROMISED TO TAKE CARE OF ME, AND THEY DELIVERED.
you SOLD ME OUT FOR MONEY.
Shawn, PEOPLE NEED YOU.
they NEED WHAT YOU CAN DO.
it DOESN'T REALLY MATTER IF YOU GET ELECTED OR NOT.
you SAYING THAT BECAUSE I'M A 4400, WHAT YOU DID IS OKAY?
I HAD TO LOOK OUT FOR MYSELF.
I'm NOT SPECIAL LIKE YOU.
I HAD TO LOOK OUT FOR MYSELF, SO I DID.
he SOUNDED RATIONAL, BUT THE THINGS THAT WERE COMING OUT OF HIS MOUTH...
I MEAN, HEAVEN ON EARTH, THE FACE OF GOD?
I'd LIKE TO SEE THIS BOOK HE'S TALKING ABOUT.
just READ THE PROPHECY.
and THEN WHAT?
you KNOW, TAKE THE SHOT AND HOPE YOU SURVIVE,
and THEN JOIN COLLIER IN PARADISE?
come ON, WHAT HAPPENED TO DIANA SKOURIS,
professional SKEPTIC?
my DAUGHTER SEES THE FUTURE.
we JUST HAVE TO CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY
that THERE COULD BE SOMETHING TO THIS.
that's ALL.
what THE HELL?
so THIS IS D. C. S BIG PLAN?
send IN A HIT SQUAD TO TAKE OUT JORDAN COLLIER?
with ALL DUE RESPECT, MA'AM,
we're NOT A HIT SQUAD.
but YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY TRAINED TO ARREST PEOPLE, ARE YOU?
jordan COLLIER IS IN OPEN REBELLION
against THE GOVERNMENT.
he SEIZED U. S. TERRITORY,
declared HIMSELF ABOVE THE LAW.
what DO YOU SUGGEST WE DO, WIPE HIS NOSE AND READ HIM A BEDTIME STORY?
those ARE OUR OPTIONS?
a BEDTIME STORY OR A BULLET TO THE HEAD?
I WAS TOLD TO SEND IN MY GUYS, AND THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.
what MAKES YOU THINK YOU COULD EVEN GET CLOSE TO HIM?
we APPRECIATE THE CONCERN, MA'AM...
but I THINK WE CAN HANDLE THINGS.
the ENHANCED SOLDIER PROGRAM.
that's STILL IN OPERATION?
the DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE CONSIDERS IT
a TOP PRIORITY.
MAIA, WHAT DO YOU MEAN, I HAVE TO SAVE JORDAN COLLIER?
the SOLDIERS.
they're GOING TO KILL HIM.
I SAW IT, AND WHEN THEY DO, SOMETHING TERRIBLE'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
terrible?
MAIA, WHAT DID YOU SEE?
it WAS JUST...
black.
what, YOU MEAN THE VISION ENDED?
no, I WAS STILL HAVING THE VISION,
but IT WAS LIKE I WASN'T THERE ANYMORE.
no ONE WAS.
please, MOM, YOU CAN'T LET JORDAN COLLIER DIE.
MAIA, I'LL DO WHAT I CAN.
I PROMISE.
I KNOW YOU WILL.
what ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE?
Cassie SAID I NEEDED TO WAIT HERE,
so I'M WAITING.
I WAS THINKING MAYBE YOU COULD ASK CASSIE WHAT MY ROLE IS IN ALL THIS?
you're PART OF IT.
I KNOW THAT MUCH.
she TOLD YOU THAT?
she TELLS ME WHAT SHE WANTS TO TELL ME.
and YOU JUST DO WHAT SHE SAYS?
does THAT BOTHER YOU?
I GUESS IT'S JUST A MATTER OF FAITH.
that's WHAT PROMISE CITY IS ALL ABOUT.
faith. BELIEF. HOPE.
Kyle, GET BACK HERE!
Kyle, I THINK SOMETHING'S HAPPENING.
we GOT A REPORT THAT SOMEONE MANAGED TO GET PAST POLICE LINES AND ENTER PROMISE CITY.
one OF THE DASHBOARD CAMERAS GOT SOME VIDEO.
Oh MY GOD!
why AREN'T YOU PICKING THIS UP?
you GET THIS MESSAGE, YOU CALL ME BACK IMMEDIATELY!
maybe SHE DIDN'T TAKE HER CELL PHONE WITH HER.
maybe THEY TOOK IT AWAY FROM HER.
jordan's NOT GOING TO HURT HER, DIANA.
Maia WENT IN THERE TO WARN HIM ABOUT THE SOLDIERS.
she HAS AN ABILITY HE'D LOVE TO HAVE ACCESS TO.
if ANYTHING, HE'S PROBABLY TREATING HER LIKE A QUEEN.
Maia's VISION ENDED IN DARKNESS.
that HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.
we HAVE GOT TO GO IN THERE AND GET KYLE AND MAIA TO SAFETY.
well, HOW DO WE GET PAST THE BEACONS?
well, AQUINO AND HIS MEN SEEM PRETTY DAMN CONFIDENT
they CAN GET THROUGH.
we GO WITH THEM.
it's A MILITARY OPERATION, DIANA.
Lawton's NOT GOING TO LET TWO NTAC AGENTS JUST TAG ALONG.
then WE DON'T ASK FOR PERMISSION.
I WAS BORN THREE YEARS AGO.
so THAT MAKES YOU, WHAT,
nine YEARS OLDER THAN ME?
almost TEN.
I LITERALLY GREW UP OVERNIGHT.
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANT TO BE AN ADULT.
you DID A LOT OF BAD THINGS.
I WAS TOLD THEY WERE...NECESSARY.
important.
but THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT, DOES IT?
no. IT DOESN'T.
so WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS THAT I'M SORRY FOR SCARING YOU,
and FOR HURTING PEOPLE YOU CARE ABOUT.
some THINGS ARE SO BAD...
saying SORRY JUST ISN'T ENOUGH.
I KNOW.
welcome TO PROMISE CITY.
I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO TALK TO ME ABOUT.
I NEED TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.
are YOU A GOOD GUY OR A BAD GUY?
my MOM CAN'T SEEM TO MAKE UP HER MIND.
I GET THAT A LOT.
I'll TELL YOU WHAT.
I HAVE SOMETHING I WANT TO SHOW YOU.
then YOU CAN MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND.
yesterday I PROMISED YOU MIRACLES.
today, I'LL SHOW YOU ONE.
this IS THE DUWAMISH RIVER DELTA.
it's ONE OF THE MOST POLLUTED WATERWAYS
in ALL OF AMERICA.
it's LOADED WITH CANCER-CAUSING CHEMICALS,
PCBs, TOXIC LEVELS OF MERCURY.
it's A BLIGHT.
Anastasia TOOK PROMICIN
when HER FIANCE WAS KILLED IN A CAR ACCIDENT.
I'm SURE YOU'LL AGREE
she's DEVELOPED A REMARKABLE ABILITY.
now, THAT'S WHAT A RIVER SHOULD LOOK LIKE.
and THAT'S THE WAY A RIVER SHOULD TASTE.
come ON IN.
the WATER'S FINE.
so, MAIA,
now DO YOU THINK I'M A GOOD GUY
or A BAD GUY?
soldiers...
with ABILITIES.
they'll BE HERE SOON.
they're COMING TO KILL YOU.
as MUCH AS I LIKE TO HEAR I WAS RIGHT,
it's NOT GOING TO MAKE A BIT OF DIFFERENCE.
yesterday, YOU SAID THAT WE COULD DEAL WITH THIS.
the SEX SCANDAL, SURE, BUT JORDAN COLLIER?
this WHOLE PROMISE CITY THING?
that WE CAN'T GET AROUND.
my POSITION ON JORDAN IS VERY CLEAR.
I PUBLICLY CONDEMNED THE MAN FOR HANDING OUT PROMICIN.
your WHOLE CAMPAIGN WAS CONSTRUCTED AROUND ONE CONCEPT...
Yes, A MIDDLE PATH FOR BOTH 4400s AND NON-4400s, ONE YOU SOLD TO ME, ONE I STILL BELIEVE IN.
there IS NO MIDDLE PATH NOW.
collier JUST BLEW IT ALL UP.
promise CITY.
miracles.
we CAN'T COMPETE WITH THAT.
so THAT'S IT?
you're TELLING ME TO JUST DROP OUT OF THE RACE.
I'm TELLING YOU YOU CAN'T WIN.
HENDERS, IT'S YOUR SHOW.
he's EAST OF HERE.
maybe TEN BLOCKS.
those GUYS GET ALL THE GOOD TRICKS.
just BE GLAD AQUINO CAN ONLY DO THAT CAMOUFLAGE THING WHEN THEY'RE STANDING STILL.
we WOULD'VE LOST THEM ?
Diana, SLOW DOWN. WE DON'T WANT TO GET TOO CLOSE. - I DON'T WANT TO LOSE THEM.
what THE HELL ARE YOU TWO DOING?
captain, WE'RE NOT HERE TO INTERFERE WITH YOUR MISSION, OKAY?
my DAUGHTER, SHE'S INSIDE PROMISE CITY.
I JUST WANT TO GET HER OUT.
look, YOU TWO GET CAUGHT,
things GET A LOT MESSIER FOR US.
surrender YOUR WEAPONS,
I'm GOING TO CUFF YOU, AND WE'LL PICK YOU UP ON THE WAY OUT.
you OBVIOUSLY DON'T HAVE CHILDREN.
I SAID SURRENDER YOUR WEAPON!
Diana, RUN!
okay, THAT'S NOT GOOD.
look, I KNOW YOU'RE HERE.
you CAN'T MOVE WHEN YOU HIDE.
so I WON'T HIDE.
aren't YOU SNEAKY?
10: 00 A. M. IN THE GARDEN.
good.
Yeah, THAT WORKS, THANKS.
okay, NOW WE WORK ON YOUR WITHDRAWAL SPEECH.
the IMPORTANT THING IS,
you GO OUT WITH YOUR HEAD HELD HIGH.
Shawn, THERE'S SOME REPORTERS DOWNSTAIRS.
tell THEM WE'LL HAVE THE PRESS CONFERENCE
tomorrow MORNING.
no.
I'll SEE THEM NOW.
I HAVE SOME THINGS THAT I WANT TO SAY.
Mr. FARRELL!
what's YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH KARA SARKESTIAN?
did YOU RECEIVE SEXUAL FAVORS FOR HEALING HER MOTHER?
are YOU IN CONTACT WITH JORDAN COLLIER?
please, PLEASE.
first OF ALL, IN SPITE OF MY ABILITY TO HEAL, I AM A NORMAL PERSON,
and THAT MEANS THAT I MAKE MISTAKES.
obviously, I MADE ONE THE OTHER NIGHT.
I REGRET THAT MY MISJUDGMENT HAS DISTRACTED FROM THE REAL ISSUES OF MY CAMPAIGN.
right NOW, AS YOU ALL KNOW, JORDAN COLLIER IS CREATING HIS OWN SEPARATE SOCIETY
in A PLACE THAT HE CALLS PROMISE CITY, FURTHER WIDENING THE DIVIDE BETWEEN PEOPLE WITH ABILITIES AND PEOPLE WITHOUT.
he SAYS THAT HE'S HERE TO HEAL THE WORLD, BUT WHAT HE'S DOING THREATENS TO TEAR EVERYTHING APART,
which IS WHY I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO CONTINUE MY CAMPAIGN,
to CONTINUE TO BE A VOICE FOR UNITY AND COOPERATION, AND TO PROVIDE A MIDDLE PATH THAT WE CAN ALL WALK TOGETHER.
I WILL ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS.
senator LENHOFF, ARE YOU STILL BACKING MR. FARRELL?
you BET I AM!
Shawn, CAN WE GET ANOTHER STATEMENT!
Hey, MOMMY.
Oh, MAIA,
I WAS SO WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
I'm SORRY.
I HAD TO WARN JORDAN.
it's JORDAN NOW?
this PLACE, MOM.
they're DOING ALL KINDS OF GREAT STUFF.
you SHOULD SEE IT.
some OTHER TIME.
we're LEAVING.
now.
no.
no?
what DO YOU MEAN, "NO"?
we CAN'T.
we HAVE TO STAY HERE.
it's SAFER THAT WAY.
bad DAY, HUH, DAD?
I've HAD BETTER.
you GOING TO CUT ME LOOSE?
so NOW WHAT?
we GO SEE JORDAN.
gentlemen, YOU'RE TRESPASSING.
are YOU SURE YOU WON'T RECONSIDER?
you COULD JOIN US, KEEP YOUR ABILITY.
that's NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
no, I SUPPOSE NOT.
it PAINS ME TO SEE GIFTS LIKE YOURS WASTED.
make SURE THEY'RE ESCORTED OUT OF PROMISE CITY.
collier, WAIT.
this ISN'T GOING TO END.
you've PAINTED A HUGE BULLSEYE ON THIS PLACE.
the GOVERNMENT'S GOING TO KEEP COMING AFTER YOU.
well, THEN I'LL JUST HAVE TO SHOW THEM ?
just...just WAIT.
maybe I WASN'T CLEAR.
you ARE FREE TO GO.
MAIA, YOU CAN COME BACK ANYTIME.
you CAN EVEN STAY HERE A WHILE IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT WITH YOUR MOTHER.
play SLEEPOVER IN A WAR ZONE? I DON'T THINK SO.
sending IN THOSE SOLDIERS, IT WAS A BAD IDEA, BUT DON'T MAKE THINGS WORSE BY RETALIATING.
[KYLE]: PEOPLE YOU WORK FOR ARE THE PROBLEM.
they NEED TO LEARN TO LEAVE US ALONE.
[JORDAN]: YOUR SON HAS A POINT.
you've PROMISED THE WORLD MIRACLES.
you've EVEN SHOWN US SOME, BUT NO ONE'S GOING TO REMEMBER THAT ONCE YOU START KILLING PEOPLE.
[DIANA]: WHEN PEOPLE START DYING, IT'S A WAR.
no MATTER HOW POWERFUL YOU THINK YOU ARE, WHEN IT'S WAR, YOU LOSE.
don't BE SO SURE.
my MOM IS RIGHT.
if THERE'S A WAR,
everyone LOSES.
you SAW THIS?
just NOW,
while YOU WERE TALKING.
please,
you HAVE TO LISTEN TO MY MOTHER.
so, WHAT DO YOU THINK, KYLE?
did MAIA GET THROUGH TO COLLIER?
will HE HOLD OFF ANY REPRISALS?
he's GOING TO DO WHAT HE THINKS IS RIGHT,
but HE WON'T HURT ANYBODY IF HE DOESN'T HAVE TO.
well, I GUESS YOU CAN MAKE IT THE REST OF THE WAY ON YOUR OWN.
I'll TURN OFF THE BEACON SO YOU CAN CROSS.
Kyle, COME WITH ME.
it COULD BE YOUR LAST CHANCE.
you NEVER GIVE UP, DO YOU?
no, AND I NEVER WILL.
that BOOK I TOLD YOU ABOUT?
the PROPHECY?
heaven ON EARTH. YEAH, I REMEMBER.
well, IN THE BOOK, THERE'S A LIST OF 200 NAMES.
people WHO CAN TAKE PROMICIN AND ARE GUARANTEED TO SURVIVE.
the LAST NAME ON THAT LIST IS YOU, DAD.
so, WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY, KYLE?
I'm DESTINED TO TAKE PROMICIN BECAUSE IT SAYS SO IN SOME BOOK? HUH?
I'm JUST SAYING YOU'RE A VERY IMPORTANT PERSON.
and NOT JUST TO ME.
I GOTTA GO.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
but I'M EXHAUSTED.
Yeah, I'M PRETTY TIRED, TOO.
this WAR,
the ONE THAT YOU TOLD COLLIER ABOUT,
what EXACTLY DID YOU SEE?
actually...
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.
sweetheart,
it DOESN'T MATTER HOW BAD IT IS.
you CAN TELL ME, BECAUSE I NEED TO KNOW.
no, MOM, I MEAN I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.
I DIDN'T HAVE A VISION.
I LIED.
Why?
well, I DIDN'T WANT JORDAN TO HURT ANYONE,
and HE WASN'T LISTENING TO YOU.
and YOU KNEW HE'D LISTEN TO YOU?
I HOPED HE WOULD.
I HOPE HE DID, TOO.
you KNOW, MOM,
jordan's NOT A BAD PERSON.
I THINK HE'S... ONE OF THE GOOD GUYS.
well, IF HE'S ONE OF THE GOOD GUYS,
what DOES THAT MAKE ME?
this IS SKOURIS.
be RIGHT THERE.
how LONG HAVE THEY BEEN THERE?
they STARTED GATHERING ABOUT 20 MINUTES AGO.
all RIGHT, HERE COMES COLLIER...
and KYLE'S WITH HIM.
and ISABELLE TYLER.
I THOUGHT YOU SAID NO ONE COULD GET CLOSE TO THOSE BEACONS.
someone MUST BE SHIELDING THEM FROM THE EFFECTS.
they're MOVING THE PERIMETER.
that's COLLIER'S REPRISAL.
he's EXPANDING PROMISE CITY.
[MEGHAN]: SO, WHAT'S HE SAYING?
the MORE WE MOVE AGAINST HIM, THE MORE LAND HE'S GOING TO TAKE.
[TOM]: TODAY SOUTH SEATTLE, TOMORROW WHAT, THE WORLD?
the WORLD WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH US.
[MAIA]: I'M NOT TIRED.
are YOU WORRIED ABOUT WHAT YOU MIGHT DREAM?
[TOM]: WHO'S CASSIE?
[CASSIE]: I'M KYLE'S ABILITY.
[TOM]: THEY DID SOMETHING TO ME LAST NIGHT.
[DREW IMROTH]: WHEN WE NEED HIM, HE'LL BE THERE FOR US.
they PUT SOMETHING INTO ME.
Where's KYLE?
Kyle AND I AGREE, YOU'RE NOT READY.
you DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE.
all RIGHT, THEN TELL ME, WHAT IS THIS PLACE?
it's A MODEL FOR A BETTER WORLD.
they're JUST LOOKING TO MAKE A BETTER LIFE FOR THEMSELVES, AND THEY DID.
promicin ISN'T JUST HERE TO IMPROVE THE WORLD.
it's HERE TO BRING HEAVEN TO EARTH.
you're SUPPOSED TO MAKE IT HAPPEN, AND I'M SUPPOSED TO HELP YOU.
you ARE GOING TO LEAD US ALL TO GOD.
so, WHAT DO WE DO NOW?
we're GOING TO SEATTLE.
everyone's WAITING.
these ARE GOOD PEOPLE.
loyal.
they BELIEVE IN THIS NEW WORLD I'VE PROMISED THEM.
it's NOT JUST A PROMISE.
it's GOING TO HAPPEN...
starting TODAY.
once WE TAKE THIS STEP,
there IS NO GOING BACK.
I NEED YOU TO TELL ME, KYLE, THAT NO MATTER THE COST, NO MATTER THE SACRIFICE, THIS WILL ALL BE WORTH IT.
you KNOW IT'S WORTH IT, JORDAN.
this IS THE RIGHT TIME.
this IS THE RIGHT PLACE.
if YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT, WE WOULDN'T BE IN SEATTLE.
let's GO CHANGE THE WORLD.
we BELIEVE IN YOU, JORDAN.
he's HERE!
three YEARS AGO, 4400 MISSING PEOPLE, EACH WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY ABILITY,
reappeared IN A BALL OF LIGHT, AND THE WORLD WONDERED WHY.
six MONTHS AGO, THE PROMICIN SHOT MADE THOSE ABILITIES ACCESSIBLE TO ANYONE WITH THE COURAGE TO TAKE IT, AND AGAIN, THE WORLD WONDERED WHY.
today, WE TELL THEM WHY.
today, WE ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS, AND AFTER TODAY, THE WORLD WILL NEVER BE THE SAME.
I'm SO SORRY.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME.
those NOODLES WERE SO OVERCOOKED.
Diana, STOP APOLOGIZING.
that's THE FIRST MEAL I'VE HAD IN MONTHS
that DIDN'T COME OUT OF A MICROWAVE OR A TAKE-OUT CARTON.
all THESE YEARS WE'VE BEEN PARTNERS, AND I HAVEN'T HAD YOU OVER FOR DINNER, AND...
you NEVER FELT THIS SORRY FOR ME BEFORE.
what?
look, WHEN A WOMAN INVITES A MAN OVER FOR DINNER, IT'S FOR ONE OF TWO REASONS, ATTRACTION, OR PITY, AND I'M PUTTING MY MONEY ON PITY.
well, BETWEEN ALANA AND KYLE,
you HAVE HAD A TOUGH RUN OF IT LATELY.
me TOO.
I FIGURED THERE'S NOTHING LIKE OVERCOOKED PASTA TO START THE HEALING PROCESS.
you KNOW, NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU RUB THAT MOLE, IT'S NOT GOING TO GO AWAY.
you're RIGHT.
it's JUST A MOLE.
I MEAN, I'M STILL ME.
I'm NOT ONE OF THE MARKED, OR WHATEVER.
no, I NEVER SAID YOU WERE.
this JOB CAN MESS WITH YOUR HEAD, HUH?
Yeah.
speaking OF WORK, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MEGHAN?
mm, SHE'S DIFFERENT.
you KNOW, FROM WHAT YOU'D EXPECT FOR A BOSS.
that's A LITTLE NONCOMMITTAL.
have YOU NOT NOTICED? I THINK SHE'S A LITTLE...
a LITTLE FOCUSED ON YOU.
what?
focused ON ME?
mom, JORDAN COLLIER.
he's ABOUT TO DO SOMETHING.
something BIG.
you SAW HIM?
did YOU HAVE A VISION?
sweetie, WHERE IS HE?
he's HERE, IN SEATTLE.
Kyle's WITH HIM.
he's RIGHT HERE.
okay, MAIA, I'VE IMPORTED YOUR DRAWING INTO A GRAPHICS FILE.
now WE CAN MAKE ANY CHANGES YOU WANT.
you KNOW, GET IT CLOSER TO WHAT YOU SAW.
the REDS,
they SHOULD BE A LITTLE DARKER, ESPECIALLY AROUND THE MIDDLE.
MAIA, ARE YOU SURE THIS REPRESENTS SOME PART OF SEATTLE?
the PICTURE HAD SOME KIND OF LINES UNDER THE COLORS.
like THAT?
there's A DEFINITE PATTERN HERE.
maybe IT'S AN ELEVATION STUDY?
red FOR PEAKS, AND BLUE AND GREEN FOR LOWER ELEVATIONS.
Yeah, AND IT COULD BE A POPULATION SURVEY, A STUDY OF HOMES OF MEDIAN INCOME.
ethnic, RELIGIOUS GROUPINGS.
well, THAT NARROWS IT DOWN.
actually, IT DOES.
all THOSE THINGS REQUIRE COMPREHENSIVE DATA ANALYSES, AND THOSE DON'T COME CHEAP.
which MEANS A BIG CORPORATE OR A GOVERNMENT STUDY.
Yeah, WHAT, D.O.D.
N.S.A. CENSUS BUREAU.
odds ARE, THIS IMAGE IS SITTING IN A GOVERNMENT COMPUTER SOMEWHERE, WHICH MEANS I CAN FIND IT.
you DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE.
I DIDN'T WANT TO OVERSTAY MY WELCOME.
listen, I HOPE YOU'RE OKAY WITH EVERYTHING.
I DIDN'T REALLY PLAN ON...
more THAN DINNER AND A MOVIE?
it's JUST, THESE LAST FEW DAYS HAVE BEEN GREAT, BUT YOUR MOM IS A CLIENT, OR SHE WAS A CLIENT.
you MAKE IT SOUND LIKE YOU WERE HER LAWYER.
my MOTHER HAD STAGE FOUR LEUKEMIA.
you SAVED HER LIFE.
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK THAT I MAKE A HABIT OUT OF SLEEPING WITH THE PEOPLE THAT I HELP.
I KNOW THAT.
I'd STAY.
I JUST HAVE THIS APPOINTMENT
first THING IN THE MORNING.
all RIGHT.
I'll CALL YOU.
I GUESS THAT ANSWERS MY QUESTION.
I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU IF YOU WERE SURE
you WANTED TO BE A PART OF THIS OPERATION.
believe ME, I WANT COLLIER CAUGHT AS MUCH AS ANYONE.
it's NOT COLLIER I WAS THINKING ABOUT.
it's YOUR SON.
look, THE ONLY THING WE HAVE ON KYLE
is TAKING PROMICIN.
I CAN STILL HELP HIM CUT A DEAL, GET HIM ON THE INHIBITOR,
but THE LONGER HE'S WITH COLLIER, THE HARDER IT'S GOING TO BE FOR ME TO HELP HIM.
are YOU SURE HE WANTS TO BE HELPED?
he's MY SON.
I've GOT TO BELIEVE I CAN STILL REACH HIM.
I'm SORRY.
I KNOW.
it's A TOXICOLOGY STUDY.
I GOT IT FROM THE EPA.
the RED AREAS INDICATE A HIGH LEVEL OF POLLUTION, PINK A LITTLE LESS,
and THEN ALL THE WAY TO GREEN, WHICH
Marco, DO YOU KNOW WHERE COLLIER IS?
Yeah.
the DUWAMISH RIVER DELTA. SOUTH SEATTLE.
one OF THE MOST POLLUTED PLACES IN THE COUNTRY.
we're TALKING OLD REFINERIES, DEAD END STREETS,
and ROTTING FACTORIES.
so, NOT A NICE PLACE.
unless YOU WANT TO HIDE, AND THEN IT'S PERFECT.
that PLACE IS A MAZE.
it COULD TAKE DAYS TO DO A COMPLETE SEARCH.
then YOU BETTER GET STARTED,
because ACCORDING TO WHAT MAIA'S TOLD US, WHATEVER JORDAN COLLIER'S PLANNING,
this IS GROUND ZERO.
Bobby, HEAD THAT WAY.
we're GOING TO COVER THIS SIDE.
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY COLLIER WOULD RISK COMING BACK TO SEATTLE.
it's LIKE HE'S DARING US TO CATCH HIM.
well, WE WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW HE WAS HERE IF IT WEREN'T FOR MAIA.
it's NOT LIKE HE'S SHOWED UP AT A MARINERS GAME.
this PLACE IS PRETTY LOW PROFILE.
I DON'T THINK THIS QUALIFIES AS LOW PROFILE.
somebody's FEELING PRETTY CONFIDENT.
Tom, WHAT ARE THOSE LIGHTS?
it's ALMOST LIKE THEY'RE MARKING
some KIND OF PERIMETER.
maybe THEY'RE WARNING LIGHTS,
an ALARM SYSTEM.
I'm CALLING FOR BACK-UP.
this IS SKOURIS.
we NEED HELP DOWN AT DUWAMISH DELTA.
Tom, WHAT?
get BACK!
well, WE WON'T BE DOING THAT AGAIN.
senator LENHOFF IS HERE.
senator, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE IN TOWN.
come TO SAY HELLO TO YOUR FAVORITE FUTURE COUNCILMAN?
actually, I'M HERE TO RUIN YOUR MORNING.
sex FOR MIRACLES?
it's ALL OVER THE NET.
every ANTI-4400 WINGNUT IS RUNNING WITH IT.
this SAYS THAT I FORCED KARA TO HAVE SEX WITH ME
in EXCHANGE FOR HEALING HER MOTHER.
you KNOW THIS GIRL?
I DIDN'T EXCHANGE SEX FOR MIRACLES, OKAY?
or FOR ANYTHING ELSE, FOR THAT MATTER.
but YOU SLEPT WITH HER?
she ASKED ME OUT TO DINNER.
we WENT OUT ON A DATE. WE HAD A REALLY GOOD TIME.
we WENT ON A COUPLE MORE DATES. I LIKE THIS GIRL.
Farrell, DID YOU OR DID YOU NOT HAVE SEX WITH THIS WOMAN?
last NIGHT.
and IT HITS THE NET THIS MORNING.
what DOES THAT TELL YOU?
you THINK THIS IS SOME KIND OF SET-UP?
I'll HAVE MY PEOPLE START DIGGING.
it SHOULD BE EASY ENOUGH TO DISCREDIT HER.
a GIRL LIKE THIS,
there's ALWAYS SOMETHING.
senator,
let's HOLD OFF ON THE CHARACTER ASSASSINATION
until I AT LEAST TALK TO KARA.
okay?
you WANT TO PLAY NICE, GIVE IT A TRY,
but IF THIS GIRL'S WHO I THINK SHE IS,
tomorrow WE COME OUT SWINGING.
these LIGHTS, OR BEACONS OR WHATEVER.
they MUST'VE BEEN BUILT BY ONE OF JORDAN'S FOLLOWERS.
they EXTEND FROM HERE ALL THE WAY TO THE RIVER.
they WALL OFF ABOUT A SQUARE MILE OF BUILDINGS
right IN THE MOST TOXIC PART OF THE DELTA.
we CALLED IN SEATTLE P. D.
and THE GUARD.
no ONE'S GETTING IN OR OUT WITHOUT US KNOWING IT.
so COLLIER'S BACKED HIMSELF INTO A CORNER.
Yeah, ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET PAST THESE LIGHTS
I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO SEE THIS.
for TOO LONG, THOSE OF US WITH SPECIAL GIFTS, AND THOSE WHO'VE TAKEN PROMICIN, HAVE HAD TO CONCEAL AND EVEN NEGLECT THEIR ABILITIES.
well, I STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY TO TELL YOU THE TIME FOR HIDING IS OVER,
and THAT THE TIME FOR MIRACLES HAS BEGUN,
and IT STARTS RIGHT HERE.
today, WE CLAIM THIS GODFORSAKEN PIECE OF EARTH OURS.
did THIS GUY JUST SAY
he's ANNEXING PART OF SEATTLE?
it SOUNDED LIKE THAT.
...to MAKE IT WHOLE AGAIN.
using OUR ABILITIES, WE WILL HEAL ITS TOXIC SOIL.
we WILL CLEANSE ITS POLLUTED WATERS,
and WE WILL TURN THIS BLIGHTED PLACE
into A GARDEN.
for THOSE WILLING TO JOIN US,
we WELCOME YOU.
all YOU NEED IS AN ABILITY, AND THE WILLINGNESS TO BECOME PART OF A MIRACLE,
but THE BLESSINGS WE BRING
will NOT JUST BE LIMITED TO THIS SMALL PLACE,
because THIS IS THE BEGINNING
of A MUCH WIDER AND DEEPER HEALING.
because THE MIRACLES WE WORK HERE,
we INTEND TO WORK EVERYWHERE.
help US, WORK WITH US, AND TOGETHER, WE CAN TRANSFORM THIS WORLD INTO A PARADISE.
Yeah, ASSUMING YOU TAKE PROMICIN AND SURVIVE.
for THOSE OF YOU UNWILLING TO JOIN US, ALL WE ASK IS THAT YOU LEAVE US IN PEACE.
if YOU INSIST ON INTERFERING,
if YOU THREATEN US, OR IN ANY WAY ATTACK US,
there WILL BE CONSEQUENCES, IMMEDIATE, AND SEVERE.
but I DID NOT COME TO INTIMIDATE.
this IS A MESSAGE OF HOPE, FOR A BETTER TOMORROW,
for A NEW WORLD, AND IT BEGINS HERE, IN THIS...
city OF HOPE.
it STARTS HERE,
in PROMISE CITY.
I'd HATE TO HAVE HER JOB.
jordan COLLIER GRABS A CHUNK OF SEATTLE
as HIS OWN PERSONAL FIEFDOM UNDER HER WATCH.
not GOING TO EARN HER ANY BROWNIE POINTS IN D. C.
no ONE COULD HAVE SEEN THAT COMING.
Tom, WE'VE GOT ANOTHER.
it's AN EARTHQUAKE IN THE ALLEGHENY MOUNTAINS, JUST OUTSIDE OF PITTSBURGH.
5. 2 ON THE RICHTER SCALE.
miles FROM THE NEAREST FAULT LINE.
a TORNADO OUTSIDE PALM SPRINGS, A WAREHOUSE EXPLOSION IN JERSEY, A TSUNAMI ON LAKE MICHIGAN.
now THIS? ANYONE HURT?
no, JUST LIKE THE OTHERS, PROPERTY DAMAGE, BUT NO INJURIES.
any CLOSER TO THE CITY, THOUGH, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT.
collier's MADE A STATEMENT ON THE NET.
he's CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL THESE MINI-DISASTERS.
he's CALLING THEM DEMONSTRATIONS.
just LETTING US KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN
if WE MOVE AGAINST HIM.
I MEAN, GOD KNOWS HOW MANY PEOPLE HE HAS WITH ABILITIES, SCATTERED AROUND THE COUNTRY JUST WAITING FOR HIS SIGNAL.
Hey, DAD.
Hey, KYLE, YOU OKAY?
Yeah, I'M FINE.
all RIGHT, GOOD. NOW, HERE'S WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO.
you GO TO THE PERIMETER, YOU WALK ACROSS, AND YOU SURRENDER TO THE FIRST NTAC AGENT YOU SEE.
dad, I'M WHERE I NEED TO BE.
things COULD GET REALLY UGLY DOWN THERE.
you NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN.
promise CITY HAS TO SUCCEED. EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON IT.
is THAT WHAT JORDAN COLLIER'S BEEN TELLING YOU?
actually, THAT'S WHAT I'M TELLING HIM.
you're SOME KIND OF ADVISOR TO HIM NOW?
something LIKE THAT.
then ADVISE HIM TO END THIS THING RIGHT NOW!
I CAN'T DO THAT, OKAY?
I KNOW THIS IS COMING AT YOU REALLY FAST, BUT YOU GOT TO HEAR ME OUT.
there's THIS BOOK. IT'S A PROPHECY.
this ABILITY THAT I HAVE LED ME TO IT.
this ABILITY OF YOURS.
you STILL HAVEN'T TOLD ME WHAT IT IS.
it's COMPLICATED.
it TELLS ME WHAT TO DO.
what's IMPORTANT, AND THIS BOOK IS IMPORTANT, DAD.
I MEAN, IT'S ALMOST 100 YEARS OLD, BUT IT TALKS ABOUT THE 4400, PROMICIN, EVERYTHING, AND DAD, IT EXPLAINS WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN FOR PARADISE TO COME TO EARTH,AND PROMISE CITY'S WHERE IT ALL STARTS.
once PEOPLE SEE WHAT WE CAN DO HERE, THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TO BE A PART OF IT,
and ONCE THAT HAPPENS, ACCORDING TO THE BOOK,
once EVERYONE'S TAKEN PROMICIN...
I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO SAY IT.
God IS GOING TO SHOW HIS FACE.
it'll BE HEAVEN ON EARTH.
are YOU STILL THERE?
Yeah, I'M HERE.
wait...
Kyle, THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
if EVERYONE IN THE WORLD TAKES THIS SHOT,
half OF THEM ARE GOING TO DIE.
you're TALKING PARADISE AT THE COST OF GENOCIDE.
dad, THE WORLD IS FALLING APART.
okay, PROMISE CITY HAS TO SUCCEED.
you CAN'T LET THEM DESTROY IT.
listen, KYLE, JUST...
can WE JUST...
can WE TALK IN PERSON?
I MEAN, COME HOME.
I AM HOME, DAD.
I'll TALK TO YOU SOON.
Shawn, I THOUGHT YOU WERE SMARTER THAN THIS.
I MEAN, ARE YOU REALLY THAT SURPRISED?
I SAVED YOUR MOTHER'S LIFE
and I WILL ALWAYS BE GRATEFUL FOR THAT.
my MOTHER WAS SICK FOR THREE YEARS.
my PARENTS WENT THROUGH THEIR ENTIRE LIFE SAVINGS.
they GAVE ME ENOUGH MONEY TO GET MY PARENTS OUT OF DEBT
and START A LIFE FOR MYSELF, TOO.
they? WHO'S THEY?
lawyers.
from BACK EAST, I THINK.
look, ALL I KNOW IS THAT THEY PROMISED TO TAKE CARE OF ME, AND THEY DELIVERED.
you SOLD ME OUT FOR MONEY.
Shawn, PEOPLE NEED YOU.
they NEED WHAT YOU CAN DO.
it DOESN'T REALLY MATTER IF YOU GET ELECTED OR NOT.
you SAYING THAT BECAUSE I'M A 4400, WHAT YOU DID IS OKAY?
I HAD TO LOOK OUT FOR MYSELF.
I'm NOT SPECIAL LIKE YOU.
I HAD TO LOOK OUT FOR MYSELF, SO I DID.
he SOUNDED RATIONAL, BUT THE THINGS THAT WERE COMING OUT OF HIS MOUTH...
I MEAN, HEAVEN ON EARTH, THE FACE OF GOD?
I'd LIKE TO SEE THIS BOOK HE'S TALKING ABOUT.
just READ THE PROPHECY.
and THEN WHAT?
you KNOW, TAKE THE SHOT AND HOPE YOU SURVIVE,
and THEN JOIN COLLIER IN PARADISE?
come ON, WHAT HAPPENED TO DIANA SKOURIS,
professional SKEPTIC?
my DAUGHTER SEES THE FUTURE.
we JUST HAVE TO CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY
that THERE COULD BE SOMETHING TO THIS.
that's ALL.
what THE HELL?
so THIS IS D. C. S BIG PLAN?
send IN A HIT SQUAD TO TAKE OUT JORDAN COLLIER?
with ALL DUE RESPECT, MA'AM,
we're NOT A HIT SQUAD.
but YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY TRAINED TO ARREST PEOPLE, ARE YOU?
jordan COLLIER IS IN OPEN REBELLION
against THE GOVERNMENT.
he SEIZED U. S. TERRITORY,
declared HIMSELF ABOVE THE LAW.
what DO YOU SUGGEST WE DO, WIPE HIS NOSE AND READ HIM A BEDTIME STORY?
those ARE OUR OPTIONS?
a BEDTIME STORY OR A BULLET TO THE HEAD?
I WAS TOLD TO SEND IN MY GUYS, AND THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.
what MAKES YOU THINK YOU COULD EVEN GET CLOSE TO HIM?
we APPRECIATE THE CONCERN, MA'AM...
but I THINK WE CAN HANDLE THINGS.
the ENHANCED SOLDIER PROGRAM.
that's STILL IN OPERATION?
the DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE CONSIDERS IT
a TOP PRIORITY.
MAIA, WHAT DO YOU MEAN, I HAVE TO SAVE JORDAN COLLIER?
the SOLDIERS.
they're GOING TO KILL HIM.
I SAW IT, AND WHEN THEY DO, SOMETHING TERRIBLE'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
terrible?
MAIA, WHAT DID YOU SEE?
it WAS JUST...
black.
what, YOU MEAN THE VISION ENDED?
no, I WAS STILL HAVING THE VISION,
but IT WAS LIKE I WASN'T THERE ANYMORE.
no ONE WAS.
please, MOM, YOU CAN'T LET JORDAN COLLIER DIE.
MAIA, I'LL DO WHAT I CAN.
I PROMISE.
I KNOW YOU WILL.
what ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE?
Cassie SAID I NEEDED TO WAIT HERE,
so I'M WAITING.
I WAS THINKING MAYBE YOU COULD ASK CASSIE WHAT MY ROLE IS IN ALL THIS?
you're PART OF IT.
I KNOW THAT MUCH.
she TOLD YOU THAT?
she TELLS ME WHAT SHE WANTS TO TELL ME.
and YOU JUST DO WHAT SHE SAYS?
does THAT BOTHER YOU?
I GUESS IT'S JUST A MATTER OF FAITH.
that's WHAT PROMISE CITY IS ALL ABOUT.
faith. BELIEF. HOPE.
Kyle, GET BACK HERE!
Kyle, I THINK SOMETHING'S HAPPENING.
we GOT A REPORT THAT SOMEONE MANAGED TO GET PAST POLICE LINES AND ENTER PROMISE CITY.
one OF THE DASHBOARD CAMERAS GOT SOME VIDEO.
Oh MY GOD!
why AREN'T YOU PICKING THIS UP?
you GET THIS MESSAGE, YOU CALL ME BACK IMMEDIATELY!
maybe SHE DIDN'T TAKE HER CELL PHONE WITH HER.
maybe THEY TOOK IT AWAY FROM HER.
jordan's NOT GOING TO HURT HER, DIANA.
Maia WENT IN THERE TO WARN HIM ABOUT THE SOLDIERS.
she HAS AN ABILITY HE'D LOVE TO HAVE ACCESS TO.
if ANYTHING, HE'S PROBABLY TREATING HER LIKE A QUEEN.
Maia's VISION ENDED IN DARKNESS.
that HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.
we HAVE GOT TO GO IN THERE AND GET KYLE AND MAIA TO SAFETY.
well, HOW DO WE GET PAST THE BEACONS?
well, AQUINO AND HIS MEN SEEM PRETTY DAMN CONFIDENT
they CAN GET THROUGH.
we GO WITH THEM.
it's A MILITARY OPERATION, DIANA.
Lawton's NOT GOING TO LET TWO NTAC AGENTS JUST TAG ALONG.
then WE DON'T ASK FOR PERMISSION.
I WAS BORN THREE YEARS AGO.
so THAT MAKES YOU, WHAT,
nine YEARS OLDER THAN ME?
almost TEN.
I LITERALLY GREW UP OVERNIGHT.
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANT TO BE AN ADULT.
you DID A LOT OF BAD THINGS.
I WAS TOLD THEY WERE...NECESSARY.
important.
but THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT, DOES IT?
no. IT DOESN'T.
so WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS THAT I'M SORRY FOR SCARING YOU,
and FOR HURTING PEOPLE YOU CARE ABOUT.
some THINGS ARE SO BAD...
saying SORRY JUST ISN'T ENOUGH.
I KNOW.
welcome TO PROMISE CITY.
I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO TALK TO ME ABOUT.
I NEED TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.
are YOU A GOOD GUY OR A BAD GUY?
my MOM CAN'T SEEM TO MAKE UP HER MIND.
I GET THAT A LOT.
I'll TELL YOU WHAT.
I HAVE SOMETHING I WANT TO SHOW YOU.
then YOU CAN MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND.
yesterday I PROMISED YOU MIRACLES.
today, I'LL SHOW YOU ONE.
this IS THE DUWAMISH RIVER DELTA.
it's ONE OF THE MOST POLLUTED WATERWAYS
in ALL OF AMERICA.
it's LOADED WITH CANCER-CAUSING CHEMICALS,
PCBs, TOXIC LEVELS OF MERCURY.
it's A BLIGHT.
Anastasia TOOK PROMICIN
when HER FIANCE WAS KILLED IN A CAR ACCIDENT.
I'm SURE YOU'LL AGREE
she's DEVELOPED A REMARKABLE ABILITY.
now, THAT'S WHAT A RIVER SHOULD LOOK LIKE.
and THAT'S THE WAY A RIVER SHOULD TASTE.
come ON IN.
the WATER'S FINE.
so, MAIA,
now DO YOU THINK I'M A GOOD GUY
or A BAD GUY?
soldiers...
with ABILITIES.
they'll BE HERE SOON.
they're COMING TO KILL YOU.
as MUCH AS I LIKE TO HEAR I WAS RIGHT,
it's NOT GOING TO MAKE A BIT OF DIFFERENCE.
yesterday, YOU SAID THAT WE COULD DEAL WITH THIS.
the SEX SCANDAL, SURE, BUT JORDAN COLLIER?
this WHOLE PROMISE CITY THING?
that WE CAN'T GET AROUND.
my POSITION ON JORDAN IS VERY CLEAR.
I PUBLICLY CONDEMNED THE MAN FOR HANDING OUT PROMICIN.
your WHOLE CAMPAIGN WAS CONSTRUCTED AROUND ONE CONCEPT...
Yes, A MIDDLE PATH FOR BOTH 4400s AND NON-4400s, ONE YOU SOLD TO ME, ONE I STILL BELIEVE IN.
there IS NO MIDDLE PATH NOW.
collier JUST BLEW IT ALL UP.
promise CITY.
miracles.
we CAN'T COMPETE WITH THAT.
so THAT'S IT?
you're TELLING ME TO JUST DROP OUT OF THE RACE.
I'm TELLING YOU YOU CAN'T WIN.
HENDERS, IT'S YOUR SHOW.
he's EAST OF HERE.
maybe TEN BLOCKS.
those GUYS GET ALL THE GOOD TRICKS.
just BE GLAD AQUINO CAN ONLY DO THAT CAMOUFLAGE THING WHEN THEY'RE STANDING STILL.
we WOULD'VE LOST THEM ?
Diana, SLOW DOWN. WE DON'T WANT TO GET TOO CLOSE. - I DON'T WANT TO LOSE THEM.
what THE HELL ARE YOU TWO DOING?
captain, WE'RE NOT HERE TO INTERFERE WITH YOUR MISSION, OKAY?
my DAUGHTER, SHE'S INSIDE PROMISE CITY.
I JUST WANT TO GET HER OUT.
look, YOU TWO GET CAUGHT,
things GET A LOT MESSIER FOR US.
surrender YOUR WEAPONS,
I'm GOING TO CUFF YOU, AND WE'LL PICK YOU UP ON THE WAY OUT.
you OBVIOUSLY DON'T HAVE CHILDREN.
I SAID SURRENDER YOUR WEAPON!
Diana, RUN!
okay, THAT'S NOT GOOD.
look, I KNOW YOU'RE HERE.
you CAN'T MOVE WHEN YOU HIDE.
so I WON'T HIDE.
aren't YOU SNEAKY?
10: 00 A. M. IN THE GARDEN.
good.
Yeah, THAT WORKS, THANKS.
okay, NOW WE WORK ON YOUR WITHDRAWAL SPEECH.
the IMPORTANT THING IS,
you GO OUT WITH YOUR HEAD HELD HIGH.
Shawn, THERE'S SOME REPORTERS DOWNSTAIRS.
tell THEM WE'LL HAVE THE PRESS CONFERENCE
tomorrow MORNING.
no.
I'll SEE THEM NOW.
I HAVE SOME THINGS THAT I WANT TO SAY.
Mr. FARRELL!
what's YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH KARA SARKESTIAN?
did YOU RECEIVE SEXUAL FAVORS FOR HEALING HER MOTHER?
are YOU IN CONTACT WITH JORDAN COLLIER?
please, PLEASE.
first OF ALL, IN SPITE OF MY ABILITY TO HEAL, I AM A NORMAL PERSON,
and THAT MEANS THAT I MAKE MISTAKES.
obviously, I MADE ONE THE OTHER NIGHT.
I REGRET THAT MY MISJUDGMENT HAS DISTRACTED FROM THE REAL ISSUES OF MY CAMPAIGN.
right NOW, AS YOU ALL KNOW, JORDAN COLLIER IS CREATING HIS OWN SEPARATE SOCIETY
in A PLACE THAT HE CALLS PROMISE CITY, FURTHER WIDENING THE DIVIDE BETWEEN PEOPLE WITH ABILITIES AND PEOPLE WITHOUT.
he SAYS THAT HE'S HERE TO HEAL THE WORLD, BUT WHAT HE'S DOING THREATENS TO TEAR EVERYTHING APART,
which IS WHY I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO CONTINUE MY CAMPAIGN,
to CONTINUE TO BE A VOICE FOR UNITY AND COOPERATION, AND TO PROVIDE A MIDDLE PATH THAT WE CAN ALL WALK TOGETHER.
I WILL ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS.
senator LENHOFF, ARE YOU STILL BACKING MR. FARRELL?
you BET I AM!
Shawn, CAN WE GET ANOTHER STATEMENT!
Hey, MOMMY.
Oh, MAIA,
I WAS SO WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
I'm SORRY.
I HAD TO WARN JORDAN.
it's JORDAN NOW?
this PLACE, MOM.
they're DOING ALL KINDS OF GREAT STUFF.
you SHOULD SEE IT.
some OTHER TIME.
we're LEAVING.
now.
no.
no?
what DO YOU MEAN, "NO"?
we CAN'T.
we HAVE TO STAY HERE.
it's SAFER THAT WAY.
bad DAY, HUH, DAD?
I've HAD BETTER.
you GOING TO CUT ME LOOSE?
so NOW WHAT?
we GO SEE JORDAN.
gentlemen, YOU'RE TRESPASSING.
are YOU SURE YOU WON'T RECONSIDER?
you COULD JOIN US, KEEP YOUR ABILITY.
that's NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
no, I SUPPOSE NOT.
it PAINS ME TO SEE GIFTS LIKE YOURS WASTED.
make SURE THEY'RE ESCORTED OUT OF PROMISE CITY.
collier, WAIT.
this ISN'T GOING TO END.
you've PAINTED A HUGE BULLSEYE ON THIS PLACE.
the GOVERNMENT'S GOING TO KEEP COMING AFTER YOU.
well, THEN I'LL JUST HAVE TO SHOW THEM ?
just...just WAIT.
maybe I WASN'T CLEAR.
you ARE FREE TO GO.
MAIA, YOU CAN COME BACK ANYTIME.
you CAN EVEN STAY HERE A WHILE IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT WITH YOUR MOTHER.
play SLEEPOVER IN A WAR ZONE? I DON'T THINK SO.
sending IN THOSE SOLDIERS, IT WAS A BAD IDEA, BUT DON'T MAKE THINGS WORSE BY RETALIATING.
[KYLE]: PEOPLE YOU WORK FOR ARE THE PROBLEM.
they NEED TO LEARN TO LEAVE US ALONE.
[JORDAN]: YOUR SON HAS A POINT.
you've PROMISED THE WORLD MIRACLES.
you've EVEN SHOWN US SOME, BUT NO ONE'S GOING TO REMEMBER THAT ONCE YOU START KILLING PEOPLE.
[DIANA]: WHEN PEOPLE START DYING, IT'S A WAR.
no MATTER HOW POWERFUL YOU THINK YOU ARE, WHEN IT'S WAR, YOU LOSE.
don't BE SO SURE.
my MOM IS RIGHT.
if THERE'S A WAR,
everyone LOSES.
you SAW THIS?
just NOW,
while YOU WERE TALKING.
please,
you HAVE TO LISTEN TO MY MOTHER.
so, WHAT DO YOU THINK, KYLE?
did MAIA GET THROUGH TO COLLIER?
will HE HOLD OFF ANY REPRISALS?
he's GOING TO DO WHAT HE THINKS IS RIGHT,
but HE WON'T HURT ANYBODY IF HE DOESN'T HAVE TO.
well, I GUESS YOU CAN MAKE IT THE REST OF THE WAY ON YOUR OWN.
I'll TURN OFF THE BEACON SO YOU CAN CROSS.
Kyle, COME WITH ME.
it COULD BE YOUR LAST CHANCE.
you NEVER GIVE UP, DO YOU?
no, AND I NEVER WILL.
that BOOK I TOLD YOU ABOUT?
the PROPHECY?
heaven ON EARTH. YEAH, I REMEMBER.
well, IN THE BOOK, THERE'S A LIST OF 200 NAMES.
people WHO CAN TAKE PROMICIN AND ARE GUARANTEED TO SURVIVE.
the LAST NAME ON THAT LIST IS YOU, DAD.
so, WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY, KYLE?
I'm DESTINED TO TAKE PROMICIN BECAUSE IT SAYS SO IN SOME BOOK? HUH?
I'm JUST SAYING YOU'RE A VERY IMPORTANT PERSON.
and NOT JUST TO ME.
I GOTTA GO.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
but I'M EXHAUSTED.
Yeah, I'M PRETTY TIRED, TOO.
this WAR,
the ONE THAT YOU TOLD COLLIER ABOUT,
what EXACTLY DID YOU SEE?
actually...
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.
sweetheart,
it DOESN'T MATTER HOW BAD IT IS.
you CAN TELL ME, BECAUSE I NEED TO KNOW.
no, MOM, I MEAN I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.
I DIDN'T HAVE A VISION.
I LIED.
Why?
well, I DIDN'T WANT JORDAN TO HURT ANYONE,
and HE WASN'T LISTENING TO YOU.
and YOU KNEW HE'D LISTEN TO YOU?
I HOPED HE WOULD.
I HOPE HE DID, TOO.
you KNOW, MOM,
jordan's NOT A BAD PERSON.
I THINK HE'S... ONE OF THE GOOD GUYS.
well, IF HE'S ONE OF THE GOOD GUYS,
what DOES THAT MAKE ME?
this IS SKOURIS.
be RIGHT THERE.
how LONG HAVE THEY BEEN THERE?
they STARTED GATHERING ABOUT 20 MINUTES AGO.
all RIGHT, HERE COMES COLLIER...
and KYLE'S WITH HIM.
and ISABELLE TYLER.
I THOUGHT YOU SAID NO ONE COULD GET CLOSE TO THOSE BEACONS.
someone MUST BE SHIELDING THEM FROM THE EFFECTS.
they're MOVING THE PERIMETER.
that's COLLIER'S REPRISAL.
he's EXPANDING PROMISE CITY.
[MEGHAN]: SO, WHAT'S HE SAYING?
the MORE WE MOVE AGAINST HIM, THE MORE LAND HE'S GOING TO TAKE.
[TOM]: TODAY SOUTH SEATTLE, TOMORROW WHAT, THE WORLD?
the WORLD WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH US.
jordan, YOU'VE DONE GREAT THINGS FOR THE 4400,
but YOU ARE ON THE WRONG PATH HERE.
and YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN REBELLIOUS,
but I THINK YOU'RE AFRAID OF CHANGE, SHAWN,
or IS IT JUST ME?
I THINK I'M SHRINKING. WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME?
I MET CORA. SHE HAS AN AMAZING ABILITY.
she CAN ACTUALLY MAKE PEOPLE YOUNGER.
Isabelle? - DADDY!
if YOUR MOTHER WERE HERE, SHE'D WANT US TO DO THIS.
she'd WANT US TO BE A FAMILY AGAIN.
Mr. TYLER,
when YOUR WIFE FAINTED THIS MORNING,
she WAS A YOUNG WOMAN.
when SHE WOKE UP LESS THAN A MINUTE LATER,
she WAS 50 YEARS OLDER?
Richard, I'M DYING.
there's A FACTION OF ELITES
who WANT THE FUTURE TO STAY EXACTLY AS IT IS.
I CALL THEM "THE MARKED.
when WE NEED HIM,
he'll BE THERE FOR US.
Mr. TYLER,
can YOU HEAR MY VOICE?
Mr. TYLER...
Mr. TYLER?
he's BEEN UNDER FOR ALMOST 20 MINUTES.
we SHOULD HAVE BEGUN THE PROCEDURE ALREADY.
where HAVE YOU BEEN?
who ARE YOU?
we're GOING TO HAVE TO WORK FAST.
this IS OUR ONLY CHANCE.
I've PRACTICED ENOUGH.
we HAVE PLENTY OF TIME.
tonight, RICHARD TYLER BECOMES A FATHER.
are YOU OKAY?
Yeah, I'M FINE.
just HAD A WEIRD DREAM.
you WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?
no, I'M OKAY.
you SHOULD GO BACK TO BED.
I'll BE RIGHT THERE.
daddy LOVES YOU.
Oh, IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU HAPPY, SWEETHEART.
daddy's BEEN WANTING THAT FOR A LONG TIME.
who ARE YOU?
who AM I?
I'm LILY.
your WIFE?
who ELSE WOULD I BE?
you're NOT LILY. LILY IS DEAD.
dead? - YOU GOT OLD. YOU PASSED ON.
no, YOU'RE WRONG.
I'm... I'M RIGHT HERE.
I DIDN'T DIE.
then WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
how DID YOU GET HERE?
well, I WOKE UP ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.
I WASN'T SURE WHERE I WAS,
not EXACTLY, BUT...
somehow KNEW YOU'D BE HOME SOON,
Isabelle...
that's THE LAST THING I REMEMBER.
I WAS...
I WAS LOOKING FOR HER AT THE CENTER, AND SHE WASN'T IN HER CRIB.
you LOOK DIFFERENT, RICHARD.
you LOOK SAD. - YOU ARE NOT REAL.
you KEEP SAYING THAT, BUT I FEEL REAL.
I MEAN, I REMEMBER EVERYTHING ABOUT MY LIFE, ABOUT US.
I CAN PICK THINGS UP.
I CAN TOUCH THINGS.
you.
you CAN FEEL THAT, RIGHT?
I CAN'T EXPLAIN WHERE I'VE BEEN, RICHARD, OR HOW I GOT HERE, BUT...
I'm NOT QUESTIONING IT, EITHER.
I'm HERE.
isn't THAT ENOUGH?
can I ASK YOU A QUESTION?
sure.
you're LEFT-HANDED.
of COURSE.
is THERE A QUESTION COMING?
you ALREADY ANSWERED IT.
I've BEEN STUDYING THE REPORTS
on WHO SURVIVES THE PROMICIN SHOT AND WHO DOESN'T.
did YOU KNOW NINE OUT OF TEN LEFT-HANDED PEOPLE WHO TAKE THE SHOT SURVIVE?
no, I DIDN'T. - WELL, IT'S TRUE.
I LEARNED THAT A COUPLE WEEKS AGO,
but I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANT.
until NOW.
there.
there's A SMALL PART OF THE BRAIN CALLED THE CORPUS CALLOSUM.
it's LIKE A BUNDLE OF WIRES THAT CONNECTS THE TWO HEMISPHERES.
it's USUALLY SLIGHTLY LARGERIN LEFTIES THAN IT IS IN RIGHTIES.
that's WHY THE LEFTIES SURVIVE.
the SIZE OF THAT PART OF THE BRAIN HELPS DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO INTEGRATE A NEW NEUROTRANSMITTER.
well, HOW BIG DOES IT HAVE TO BE?
I DON'T KNOW.
okay. - YET.
but I THINK I CAN FIGURE IT OUT, AND IF I DO,
a SIMPLE CAT SCAN WILL TELL ME HOW ANYONE'S BODY WILL REACT TO THE SHOT.
and YOU'D KNOW IN ADVANCE WHETHER OR NOT YOU'D LIVE OR DIE.
the SHOT WOULDN'T HAVE TO KILL ANYONE ANYMORE.
okay, HOW LONG DO YOU NEED?
a COUPLE OF MONTHS, MAYBE LESS.
this IS HUGE.
keep WORKING. I'LL GET YOU ANYTHING YOU NEED, OKAY?
where ARE YOU GOING?
I GOT TO GET IN CONTACT WITH COLLIER.
if THIS TEST IS REALLY ONLY A FEW MONTHS AWAY, ALL HE HAS TO DO IS MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT,
telling PEOPLE THAT ARE THINKING ABOUT TAKING THE SHOT
to SIMPLY WAIT.
this IS GREAT.
Hey, TOM.
what ARE YOU DOING STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HALLWAY?
is EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?
Yeah, I'M-I'M FINE.
I've JUST... HAD A STRANGE MORNING.
well, JOIN THE CLUB.
we've JUST HAD A SURPRISE VISIT FROM REBECCA PARRISH.
some MIGHT SAY AN AMBUSH.
the DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE IS HERE?
Yeah.
she's BEEN IN MEGHAN'S OFFICE THE PAST 20 MINUTES, AND THAT'S NOT ALL.
she's ASKED TO SEE US.
I DON'T THINK SHE LIKES TO WAIT.
morning, AGENT BALDWIN.
agent SKOURIS.
I'm REBECCA PARRISH, AND IT IS A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.
Oh, THE PLEASURE'S ALL OURS.
I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE DIFFICULT JOBS HERE AT NTAC,
but LATELY, IT SEEMS THAT WE'VE HAD NOTHING BUT BAD NEWS COMING OUT OF SEATTLE.
promicin USE IS GROWING.
the FOUNDING OF PROMISE CITY WAS A MAJOR DEFEAT FOR THIS AGENCY,
and IN THE ADMINISTRATION.
it's TEMPORARY.
we'll ARREST COLLIER, AND WE'LL SHUT THAT PLACE DOWN.
I LIKE YOUR ATTITUDE, BUT YOU'LL FORGIVE ME IF I'M NOT REASSURED.
because RECENTLY, IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE EVEN BOTCHING THE LITTLE THINGS.
we HAD RICHARD TYLER AND HIS DAUGHTER SURROUNDED, OUTNUMBERED.
the SITUATION WAS IN HAND,
and WE LOST HIM ANYWAY.
well, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,I WAS THERE, AND THAT SITUATION WAS ANYTHING BUT "IN HAND.
richard TYLER HAS BECOME AN EXTREMELY POWERFUL MAN.
I UNDERSTAND,
but WE CAN'T SIMPLY JUST THROW OUR HANDS UP,
now, CAN WE?
in TWO WEEKS,
I'm BEING ASKED TO TESTIFY BEFORE A CONGRESSIONAL SUBCOMMITTEE
on THE PROGRESS OF THE WAR AGAINST PROMICIN.
I'll BE HERE FOR THE ENTIRE WEEK TO PREPARE, AND I WOULD LIKE TO GO BACK WITH A VICTORY.
so, YOU WANT US TO BRING IN RICHARD.
ms. PARRISH ASKED TO MEET
my TWO BEST AGENTS.
that's WHY YOU'RE HERE.
that's ALSO WHY YOU'RE HEADING UP A TASK FORCE TO FIND THE TYLERS.
I WILL BE CHECKING IN ON YOUR PROGRESS.
I TRUST THIS WON'T BE A PROBLEM.
agent BALDWIN?
did YOU HAVE SOMETHING YOU NEEDED TO SAY?
I'm...
sure TOM JUST WANTS TO GET TO WORK.
we'll, UH...
find THE TYLERS FOR YOU.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING, DIANA.
it's LIKE I'M SEEING MYSELF IN THE FUTURE, ONLY IT'S NOT ME.
I'm DOING THINGS
I WOULD NEVER DO.
what IF THEY'RE NOT JUST DREAMS?
what IF THEY'RE SOMEONE ELSE'S MEMORIES?
what IF THEY REALLY DID PUT SOMETHING INSIDE ME WHEN I WAS IN THAT HOSPITAL?
what IF...
what IF IT'S STARTING TO AFFECT ME?
I'm BECOMINGONE OF THE MARKED.
Oh, WHOA, TOM.
hey...
listen, EVEN IF YOU'RE RIGHT,IT-IT HASN'T HAPPENED YET.
you're STILL YOU, OKAY?
so WE CAN FIGHT IT.
how?
well, HAVE YOU BEEN TO SEE A DOCTOR SINCE THESE DREAMS BEGAN?
no.
okay, WELL,WHY DON'T YOU START THERE?
go FIND YOURSELF A PRIVATE PHYSICIAN, GET YOURSELF CHECKED OUT.
we're SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING FOR RICHARD.
just GO. GO.
I'll COVER FOR YOU.
go.
okay. - OKAY.
she LOOKS SO MUCH OLDER.
how LONG HAVE I BEEN GONE?
a LITTLE WHILE.
more THAN A YEAR.
tell ME WHAT HAPPENED.
I WANT TO HEAR IT ALL.
why DO YOU LOOK SO SAD?
I BURIED YOU, LILY. I MOURNED YOU.
I NEVER IMAGINED I'D BE SITTING BESIDE YOU AGAIN, AND I DON'T WANT TO WASTE THE TIME WE HAVE
on EXPLAIN IT WE HAVE ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD, THOUGH.
why WOULDN'T WE?
you STILL DON'T BELIEVE I'M REAL, DO YOU?
I DON'T KNOW.
if I LET MYSELF BELIEVE IT, AND I TURN OUT TO BE WRONG...
I'm NOT SURE I COULD LIVE WITH THAT.
let's JUST SEE, OKAY?
we'll JUST LAY HERE FOR A WHILE,
and IF I'M STILL BESIDE YOU WHEN WE WAKE UP...
I GUESS WE'RE REAL.
you SAVED THESE PICTURES OF US.
of COURSE I DID.
who's THIS?
she's A FRIEND OF MINE.
she LIVED AT THE 4400 CENTER
after YOU WERE GONE.
she's PRETTY.
she LOOKS NICE, TOO.
I CAN SEE WHY YOU SAVED THE PICTURE.
I DON'T KNOW.
there's NOTHING DIFFERENT ABOUT ME, DIANA.
I HAD EVERY TEST THEY COULD GIVE ME.
they ALL SAY I'M IN PERFECT HEALTH.
I'll CALL YOU BACK.
what's GOING ON?
sorry FOR THE INTRUSION.
my SECURITY DETAILIS NOTHING IF NOT THOROUGH.
they HAVE TO BE.
the ADMINISTRATION HAS ENEMIES EVERYWHERE THESE DAYS.
what THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE, MS. PARRISH?
I WANTED TO HAVE A WORD WITH YOU IN PRIVATE.
gentlemen...
gentlemen, AGENT BALDWIN AND I NEED THE ROOM.
thank YOU.
damn IT, THIS IS MY HOUSE
I'm GOING TO PAY YOU THE RESPECT OF BEING FRANK.
I WAS A LITTLE CONCERNED WITH YOUR...
outburst IN MS. DOYLE'S OFFICE THIS MORNING.
are YOU QUITE SURE YOU'RE UP TO THE JOB OF TRACKING DOWN RICHARD TYLER?
I'm FINE.
that's GOOD TO HEAR.
this MIGHT SURPRISE YOU,BUT I THINK I HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.
right AFTER I TOOK THIS JOB,
I FELT LIKE I WAS ON THE VERGE OF A BREAKDOWN MYSELF.
I WAS OVERWHELMED AT WORK, AND I WAS... HAVING THESE STRANGE MOMENT SWHERE I WAS SEEING THINGS.
it WAS ALMOST LIKE I WASN'T MYSELF, LIKE SOMEONE ELSE WAS IN MY HEAD.
do YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING?
I THINK I DO.
let ME ASK YOU SOMETHING, MS. PARRISH.
if I LOOK BEHIND YOUR LEFT EAR, WOULD I FIND A MARK THERE?
a MARK?
you MEAN LIKE A MOLE?
that's HARD TO SAY.
once YOU TURN 40,
your SKIN CHANGES ALL THE TIME.
I REMEMBER HOW NERVOUS I WAS
in THOSE DAYS.
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO LOSE MYSELF FOREVER.
I FOUGHT IT. MY GOD, HOW I FOUGHT IT, AND THEN ONE DAY, I JUST COULDN'T FIGHT IT ANYMORE.
I GAVE IN.
I ACCEPTED MY SITUATION,
and YOU KNOW WHAT?
things HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER FOR ME SINCE THEN.
I'm HAPPIER.
my FRIENDS TELL METHAT I'M LIKE A NEW PERSON.
you SHOULD RELAX, TOM.
whatever YOU'RE GOING THROUGH,
just...
let IT HAPPEN.
you'll FEEL BETTER.
I PROMISE.
you're SAYING REBECCA PARRISH
is ONE OF THESE PEOPLE?
she's MARKED?
Yeah, I THINK SO.
I MEAN, SHE NEVER CAME OUT AND SAID IT.
but YOU HAVEN'T HAD ANY MORE HALLUCINATIONS, RIGHT?
so MAYBE IT'S POSSIBLE SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.
what DO YOU THINK?
I THINK IT'S CRAZY, AND I DOUBT WE'LL BE ABLE TO PROVE ANY OF THIS,
but I HAVE TO GO WITH TOM.
I THINK THAT THERE'S A VERY GOOD CHANCE THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE IS MARKED.
we're GOING TO HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL
with HOW WE PROCEED.
ntac WOULD BE LOOKING FOR RICHARD TYLER NO MATTER WHAT,
so WE'LL KEEP DOING THAT.
I'm PASSING THE CASE OVER TO GARRITY AND ASHMORE.
Tom, YOU'RE TAKING A PERSONAL DAY TOMORROW.
Diana AND I WILL KEEP AN EYE ON YOU.
we'll WATCH OVER YOU IN SHIFTS.
I'm SORRY, SHAWN, ARE YOU REALLY ASKING ME TO TELL PEOPLE NOT TO TAKE PROMICIN?
only FOR A FEW MONTHS.
jordan, I KNOW THAT WE HAVE HAD OUR DIFFERENCES
in THE PAST,
but THIS IS GOOD FOR BOTH OF US.
all WE HAVE TO DO IS BE PATIENT.
it's NOT THE NEED FOR PATIENCE THAT CONCERNS ME.
it's THE WORLDWIDE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS TEST.
Sean, THERE WOULD BE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
with ABILITIES
and MILLIONS WITHOUT ANY CHANCE OF HAVING THEM.
Yes, BUT THEY WOULD BE ALIVE.
and LIVING IN A WORLD
with TWO CLASSES OF HUMAN BEING.
positives AND NEGATIVES CANNOT LIVE SIDE BY SIDE.
those WITHOUT ABILITIES
will TEAR DOWN THE ONES WHO HAVE THEM,
or THE POSITIVES WILL SIMPLY USE THEIR POWERS
to RID THEMSELVES OF THE NEGATIVES.
inquisition OR HOLOCAUST.
either WAY, IT'S A RECIPE FOR HELL ON EARTH.
what's YOUR ALTERNATIVE?
you REALLY WANT THE ENTIRE WORLD TO TAKE PROMICIN?
Yes. YES, I DO.
it's WHAT I'VE ALWAYS SAID HAS TO HAPPEN.
half OF THE PLANET WILL DIE!
you're TALKING ABOUT MASS SUICIDE!
I AM TALKING...
about A SINGLE GENERATION OF SACRIFICE,
and AT THE END OF IT,
a MORE FULLY-EVOLVED SPECIES.
all OF OUR FAILINGS AS HUMAN BEINGS
will BE ADDRESSED WHEN WE ARE ALL GIFTED.
I AM NOT MAKING ANY ANNOUNCEMENT.
and NO ONE WHO CARES
about WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THE WORLD WOULD.
somebody GOT SO BIG!
Ooh, SHE GOT HEAVY, TOO.
Yeah.
just ONE, JUST ONE.
I'm GOING TO GO PLAY.
all RIGHT, GO PLAY.
she SEEMS SO HAPPY.
aren't TODDLERS SUPPOSED TO BE MOODY?
Oh, ISABELLE'S HAD HER MOMENTS,
believe ME.
Oh, I'M SURE SHE HAS.
ever SINCE I GOT BACK,
I've BEEN THINKING ABOUT
what IT MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE FOR YOU, RAISING HER ON YOUR OWN.
you KNOW, NEITHER OF US ASKED TO BE PARENTS,
not THAT IT MAKES IT ANY LESS WONDERFUL,
but STILL...
it JUST KIND OF HAPPENED.
but YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN THERE FOR HER,
even WHILE I WAS GONE.
you're A GREAT FATHER, RICHARD.
you CAN TELL JUST BY LOOKING AT HER.
I'm DEFINITELY USING MY ABILITY ON RICHARD TYLER.
he's SEEING HIS DEAD WIFE,
but I HAVE NO IDEA IF THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT
what HE DID TO HIS DAUGHTER.
I JUST MAKE HIM SEE HER.
everything THEY TALK ABOUT COMES FROM HIM.
okay, KEEP AT IT.
we DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER OPTIONS AT THIS POINT.
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER I CAN DO THIS.
look, I KNOW YOU'RE TIRED,
but THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.
I WON'T FORGET WHAT YOU DID FOR ME.
can I GET A COFFEE OR SOMETHING?
Absolutely.
it's WORKING.
we JUST NEED MORE TIME.
if YOU KNOW WHERE ISABELLE IS, JUST TELL ME.
I CAN HELP HER MYSELF.
didn't REALLY WORK OUT SO WELL THE LAST TIME YOU TRIED IT,
did IT?
it's TOO SOON FOR THAT.
Richard's NOT READY TO GIVE HER UP YET.
this IS JUST THE FIRST PART OF A PLAN TO GET HER BACK.
when WE'RE READY FOR THE NEXT PART,
I'll LET YOU KNOW.
or YOU CAN TELL ME NOW.
did YOU KNOW HE WAS INVOLVED WITH HER GRANDMOTHER?
why DO YOU THINK WE PICKED THESE TWO?
after WE SEND THEM BACK TO THEIR TIME,
they'll FIND EACH OTHER.
they'll FORM A BOND.
it's DONE.
she's PREGNANT.
honey...
honey, MEGHAN.
honey, WAKE UP.
I HAD THE DREAM AGAIN.
of COURSE YOU DID, TOM.
you're BECOMING YOUR NEW SELF.
you're ONE OF US NOW.
welcome ABOARD.
did YOU HAVE ANOTHER DREAM?
no, I SLEPT LIKE A BABY, ACTUALLY.
I FEEL GREAT.
forgot HOW MUCH I HATE IT HERE.
there's SO MUCH NOISE IN THIS TIME PERIOD.
so MANY PEOPLE.
I MEAN, LOOK AT THEM.
they HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S COMING.
they JUST MOVE FROM POINTLESS ERRAND
to POINTLESS ERRAND.
it's DISGUSTING.
I'd THINK YOU'D BE GLAD JUST TO BE ALIVE.
you WERE GIVEN A CHANCE TO CONTINUE YOUR WORK.
the WORK THAT FAILED SO BADLY?
the WORK THAT GOT MY PREVIOUS HOST KILLED?
don't BLAME YOUR SHORTCOMINGS ON MATTHEW ROSS.
we ARE OUR HOSTS.
your INABILITY TO HARNESS ISABELLE TYLER WAS YOUR FAILURE.
I'll DO BETTER THIS TIME.
you NEED TO GET BACK TO WORK.
convince THEM TO RETURN YOU TO ACTIVE DUTY.
I'll PULL SOME STRINGS IF I HAVE TO,
but IT'S BETTER IF YOU GOT IT DONE ON YOUR OWN.
and AFTER I'M THERE?
that's THE EASY PART.
do WHAT TOM BALDWIN WOULD DO.
find ISABELLE TYLER.
I'll BE IN TOUCH.
Richard, COME PLAY.
I CAN'T.
Lily, I HAVE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.
what IS IT, SWEETHEART?
I LIED TO YOU.
that PICTURE YOU SAW.
the PRETTY GIRL.
that WAS ISABELLE.
my GOD, RICHARD.
I HAD NO IDEA THINGS HAD GOTTEN SO BAD.
I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO FORGIVE ME,
but I NEED YOU TO UNDERSTAND.
I DID IT FOR OUR DAUGHTER.
why DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THE TRUTH RIGHT AWAY?
I've BEEN HAPPY,
being WITH YOU THE LAST FEW DAYS.
you DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT'S BEEN
since I'VE FELT THAT WAY.
a GOOD FATHER WILL DO ANYTHING FOR HIS CHILD,
and YOU'RE A GOOD FATHER.
but, RICHARD,
you TOOK AWAY HER LIFE.
the GOOD AND THE BAD.
you ERASED EVERYTHING SHE WAS,
everything SHE COULD HAVE BEEN.
I KNEW I WAS WRONG AFTER I DID IT TO HER, BUT.
other PEOPLE TOLD ME AS MUCH, BUT I DIDN'T LISTEN.
I GUESS THE ONLY PERSON I COULD LISTEN TO WAS YOU.
daddy...
I FEEL REAL.
we're TALKING.
I've HELD ISABELLE.
no, YOU HAVEN'T.
my ABILITY MAKES IT SEEM LIKE YOU HAVE.
I DON'T KNOW
if I'M SEEING YOU BECAUSE I WANT TO,
or IF SOMEONE CONJURED YOU UP FOR ME.
I DON'T KNOW, RICHARD.
I DON'T KNOW HOW I GOT HERE,
but MAYBE IT DOESN'T MATTER.
I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO BE HERE MUCH LONGER.
but IF I HAVE TO GO,
will YOU JUST HOLD ME?
I LOVE YOU, RICHARD.
I'm NOT SAYING WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY,
but NOTHING HAPPENED LAST NIGHT,
and THIS MORNING, TOM SAID HE FELT FINE.
well, HE SAID HE DIDN'T WANT ME TO COME OVER,
but WHERE IS HE?
because TOM IS ALWAYS HERE AT THE CRACK OF DAWN.
Hey, WHAT'S UP WITH TOM?
he JUST DRAGGED MARCO OUT OF HIS OFFICE.
I DON'T KNOW, I THINK BALDWIN'S GONE NUTS OR SOMETHING.
your MIND IS NO MATCH FOR THE POWER OF MY MIND.
you ARE NOW UNDER MY CONTROL.
my MIND IS NO MATCH FOR THE POWER OF YOUR MIND.
I AM NOW UNDER YOUR CONTROL.
total CONTROL. - TOTAL CONTROL.
you SHOULD SEE THEIR FACES.
sorry, WE WERE JUST TRYING TO EASE THE TENSION A LITTLE BIT,
that's ALL.
you IDIOTS!
Marco, YOU'RE FIRED.
you TOO, GARRITY. - WHOA...
come ON, THAT WAS CLASSIC!
you CAN'T FIRE THIS.
go BACK TO YOUR OFFICE AND SOLVE SOMETHING.
Oh, HEY, COME ON... - QUICK.
I'm SORRY.
good WORK.
no HUMOR. NO HUMOR IN THIS ROOM.
what?
Ah, YOU KNOW WHAT?
seriously, LOOK,
I'd LIKE TO THANK YOU BOTH
for HELPING ME GET THROUGH THESE PAST FEW DAYS,
but I HAD A GREAT NIGHT'S SLEEP.
I FEEL BETTER,
and, LOOK, I REALLY HOPE THIS IS ALL OVER.
you KNOW, IF I HAVE ANY MORE FLASHES,
I'll TELL YOU RIGHT AWAY, BUT IN THE MEANTIME,
I'd REALLY LIKE TO GET BACK TO WORK.
what ABOUT REBECCA PARRISH?
I THINK WE NEED TO KEEP AN EYE ON HER.
her VISIT TO MY PLACE WAS...
was DEFINITELY WEIRD,
but MAYBE YOU WERE RIGHT.
maybe THE WHOLE THING
was HER BIZARRE VERSION OF A PEP TALK.
look, WHATEVER IT IS,
I DON'T HAVE TO TRUST HER TO DO MY JOB,
and I REALLY WANT TO DO MY JOB.
all RIGHT,
but I'LL BE WATCHING YOU, OKAY?
any MORE ATTEMPTS AT MIND CONTROL, BALDWIN,
and YOU'RE OUT.
okay.
wasn't FUNNY.
I HAVE A VERY SIMPLE MESSAGE
for ANYONE WHO'S THINKING ABOUT TAKING THE SHOT.
wait. IN A FEW MONTHS,
research THAT I'M FUNDING WILL BE COMPLETE
and 50-50 WILL BE A THING OF THE PAST.
we WILL HAVE A VERY SIMPLE TEST
that CAN TELL YOU WHETHER OR NOT YOU'LL SURVIVE THE SHOT,
and NO ONE EVER HAS TO RISK DYING AGAIN.
is JORDAN COLLIER IN FAVOR OF THIS?
you'd HAVE TO ASK HIM THAT, PAUL,
but WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PREVENTING
thousands OF NEEDLESS DEATHS HERE.
I DON'T SEE HOW ANYONE COULD THINK THAT'S A BAD THING.
you DID THIS TO YOUR OWN CHILD.
I'm DISAPPOINTED IN YOU, RICHARD.
you TOLD ME YOU WANTED TO USE THAT WATER I GAVE YOU
to HELP AN OLD ARMY BUDDY.
I KNOW IT WAS WRONG.
but YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE GAVE ME WHAT I NEEDED
if YOU KNEW WHAT I HAD IN MIND.
Oh, YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.
these ABILITIES WE HAVE,
they ARE A GIFT FROM GOD,
and WE NEED TO TREAT THEM WITH RESPECT.
I KNOW THAT,
and THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
I'm HOPING YOU CAN SET THINGS RIGHT.
Cora, PLEASE.
I NEED YOUR HELP.
I'll SEE WHAT I CAN DO.
Byron, YOU GOTTA WAKE UP.
Isabelle NEEDS YOU, COME ON
let HIM SLEEP.
he DID WHAT HE NEEDED TO DO.
does THAT MEAN ISABELLE'S OKAY?
not EXACTLY,
but WE'RE GETTING CLOSE.
I NEED YOU TO CALL YOUR FATHER.
call MY FATHER? WHY?
you're GOING TO HAVE TO TELL HIM WHERE ISABELLE IS.
you WANT ME TO BETRAY HER TO THE GOVERNMENT?
no.
if YOU KNOW WHERE SHE IS, TELL ME.
I'll GO THERE MYSELF.
this IS HOW IT HAS TO BE.
I PROMISE YOU, KYLE,
if YOU DO EXACTLY WHAT I SAY,
Isabelle WILL NOT WIND UP IN JAIL.
think OF EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE, KYLE.
all THAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED TOGETHER.
are YOU REALLY GOING TO START DOUBTING ME NOW?
did IT WORK?
daddy.
are YOU GOING OUT?
Yeah.
Yeah, WE HAD A TIP ON THE TYLER CASE.
someone CALLED IN FROM PROMISE CITY,
gave US THE NAME AND ADDRESS OF A 4400
that RICHARD CLAIMED HE'D BEEN IN CONTACT WITH.
it WAS ANONYMOUS, PROBABLY NOTHING.
you HAD THE APPOINTMENT AT MAIA'S SCHOOL.
I FIGURED I'D RUN IT DOWN WHILE YOU WERE OUT.
well, I'M BACK, SO I'LL GO WITH YOU.
I'll JUST GET MY JACKET.
okay, GREAT.
did YOU SEE THAT?
the CURTAIN JUST MOVED.
well, SO SOMEONE KNOWS WE'RE HERE.
that TIP OF YOURS SAID THIS LADY'S
just AN ASSOCIATE OF TYLER'S, RIGHT?
Yeah, BUT WE'D BETTER PLAY IT SAFE.
knock ON THE DOOR.
I'm GOING TO HEAD AROUND BACK,
make SURE NO ONE TRIES TO FLEE THE SCENE.
Richard, A CAR JUST PULLED UP OUTSIDE.
some PEOPLE ARE COMING.
get DOWN TO THE BASEMENT.
if YOU HEAR ANY KIND OF STRUGGLE,
run OUT THE BACK, UNDERSTAND?
answer THE DOOR IF THEY KNOCK.
see IF YOU CAN GET RID OF THEM.
Hi. I'M DIANA SKOURIS. I'M FROM NTAC.
I'd LIKE TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS
about RICHARD TYLER.
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM SINCE QUARANTINE.
do YOU MIND IF I COME IN?
so RICHARD HASN'T TRIED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU AT ALL?
no PHONE CALLS? NO EMAILS?
no, BUT I KEEP PRETTY MUCH TO MYSELF.
right.
Oh, I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T REALIZE I WAS INTERRUPTING SOMETHING.
you HAVE COMPANY.
no, NO, PARDON MY MESS.
I'm NOT TOO GOOD ABOUT CLEANING UP AFTER MYSELF.
like I SAY,
I KNEW THE MAN IN QUARANTINE,
but I DON'T REALLY KEEP IN TOUCH
with MANY OF THE 4400s.
you PEOPLE JUST DON'T QUIT.
don't MOVE.
are YOU OKAY?
what HAVE YOU DONE TO THEM?
honey...
are YOU OKAY?
Oh...
Yeah, I THINK SO.
I'm SORRY. I WENT AROUND BACK,
and ISABELLE WAS ALREADY HALFWAY DOWN THE ALLEY
when I GOT OUT THERE.
I WAS GOING TO CHASE HER,
but I CAME BACK WHEN I HEARD THE GUNSHOT.
where IS SHE NOW?
I DON'T KNOW, DIANA. SHE GOT AWAY.
good JOB, GUYS.
today, AGENT BALDWIN AND AGENT SKOURIS
provided A TEXTBOOK EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE NEED TO WIN THIS FIGHT.
initiative, SAVVY,
and EXCEPTIONAL TEAMWORK.
the APPREHENSION OF RICHARD TYLER
is A HUGE WIN FOR US,
a REMINDER TO EVERYONE
that THE RULE OF LAW STILL PREVAILS
in THIS COUNTRY.
make NO MISTAKE,
there's LOTS MORE TO BE DONE,
but TODAY...
today WE WON.
nice SPEECH.
Yeah, EXACTLY WHAT PARRISH WOULD SAY
if SHE WERE MARKED.
then AGAIN, IT'S EXACTLY WHAT PARRISH WOULD SAY
if SHE WASN'T MARKED.
I KNOW, EITHER WAY, SHE WON TODAY.
nice WORK, YOU GUYS.
I GOTTA GO MAKE NICE.
Hey, YOU...
you GONNA BE OKAY?
Yeah.
sure?
we REALLY GOT LUCKY TODAY,
just FINDING RICHARD IN THAT HOUSE.
it's A GOOD THING YOU GOT THAT TIP.
Yeah, WELL, IT HAS TO WORK OUT FOR US SOMETIMES, DOESN'T IT?
this IS NOT HOW THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO END!
richard IS IN PRISON! IT'S ALL OVER THE NEWS!
Isabelle's ON THE RUN. GOVERNMENT'S LOOKING FOR HER.
you SAID THAT SHE'D BE OKAY. YOU LIED TO ME!
I PROMISED YOU SHE WOULDN'T END UP IN JAIL.
she's NOT IN JAIL.
Yeah, AND SHE'S NOT SAFE, EITHER.
this IS NOT WHAT I WANTED
this ISN'T ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT, KYLE!
it's ABOUT WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN!
I'm NOT YOUR SIDEKICK.
I'm NOT HERE TO RUN ERRANDS FOR YOU.
I'm HERE TO TELL YOU WHAT THE MOVEMENT NEEDS,
and RIGHT NOW, IT NEEDS FOR YOU TO BE STRONG,
because THE NEXT THING YOU HAVE TO DO,
trust ME,
it's NOT GOING TO BE EASY FOR YOU.
what ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
your COUSIN SHAWN?
the WORK HE'S DOING WITH THAT SCIENTIST
is THREATENING THE ENTIRE MOVEMENT.
collier KNOWS ABOUT IT,
but HE'S TOO AFRAID TO GET HIS HANDS DIRTY.
he SHOULDN'T HAVE TO GET HIS HANDS DIRTY.
that's WHAT HE HAS PEOPLE LIKE YOU FOR.
people LIKE ME?
what DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
Shawn FARRELL HAS TO BE STOPPED.
don't WORRY. YOU'RE SAFE.
where AM I?
you're AT MY HOUSE.
I GAVE YOU A TRANQUILIZER, THEN I BROUGHT YOU HERE.
Where's MY FATHER?
we PUT HIM ON THE INHIBITOR.
he's IN PRISON,
and HE'S GOING TO BE THERE FOR A VERY LONG TIME.
he DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.
he WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP ME-- - SHH...
Isabelle, IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.
there's A WAY TO GET HIM OUT.
I... I KNOW PEOPLE WHO COULD MAKE IT HAPPEN.
it WOULD BE EASY.
there's JUST ONE THING.
you...
have TO TAKE YOUR ABILITIES BACK.
then YOU'LL BRING JORDAN COLLIER TO ME.
the world will have to deal with us.
you belong here in promise city with us, K.
in since when did kidnapping become part of this new religion of yours?
a promicin compatibility test would be death to this movement.
I wish Jordan had buried that stuff somewhere.
just do me a favor, okay, and just hold off for a while.
what about the conspiracy?
what about the marked?
I made the whole thing up.
they got to you. They bought you off.
I think that there's a very good chance the director of national intelligence is marked.
you don't feel any different, do you?
you mean, am I one of the marked?
some kind of zombie controlled by a future human?
you're not Tom Baldwin, are you?
promicin is evil.
people who use it are evil.
the goal isn't to change the world, it is to end it.
you can stop them.
what do we do now, Diana?
find a way to get the real Tom Baldwin back.
with Tom, sometimes, I think he knows.
like, I could be working a case, and I'll catch him staring at me like he's studying me, and trying to figure out if I'm onto him.
and we're supposed to be acting like nothing's changed.
I've been seeing the guy.
every time he puts a hand on me, I have to...
keep myself from shivering.
we can't keep this up forever.
sooner or later, he's going to figure out we know he's marked.
we have to find a way to get rid of that thing inside him.
all that water.
takes some getting used to, huh?
they'll just pollute it.
they don't know what to do with the resources they have.
Isabelle's in promise city.
as soon as she gets close to Collier, she'll move.
she knows not to damage him, right?
good.
there's one other thing I need you to take care of.
a potential loose end.
your partner's daughter, Maia Skouris?
if she has the wrong vision at the wrong time
it could complicate things.
I'll handle it.
but we don't even know how they make someone marked
never mind how you'd get one of those things out of somebody.
without more information, I don't know what we can do.
there is someone who knows more about the marked than we do.
feel like a trip to Canada?
cut!
print!
perfect!
Curtis, I think we need to go again.
there was a camera shadow on the dead guy in the shot
don't worry about it, we'll fix it in post.
I'm going to be in my trailer while you light the next shot.
I got to make some tweaks to this scene.
great job, phil!
Hello, Curtis.
sit down. We have some questions.
about what?
about what camera lens you're using today.
what do you think, Curtis?
we want to talk about the marked.
I already told you guys, I made all that up.
the marked aren't real.
look, I have to work.
if you want to watch me direct, I can get you some headphones.
you're not going back to work any time soon.
now all we need you to do is tell us how to kill one of those things.
you guys shouldn't even be here.
it's not safe.
I'm pretty sure people are watching me all the time.
so you do admit the marked are real.
this is simple.
tell us what we want to know, and we'll be gone.
how do you get one of those things out of somebody?
look, I'm not even sure you can.
I burned my screenplay, but there was this one scene I was writing.
they were marking Matthew Ross.
they had to put some kind of weird fluid into his spine.
I think that's how they take people over.
the characters I was writing, they kept talking about these...
tiny machines inside the fluid.
tiny machines?
what does that mean?
look, I'm a filmmaker, I'm not a scientist.
all by yourself?
Yeah.
I like it here in the morning.
it is pretty.
what's your name?
what can you do?
what makes you special, Sophia?
you know how we have five senses?
I can play with them.
I can make whichever ones I want stronger or weaker.
so if you want to, you could make someone blind or deaf?
Sophia, why don't you come along with me?
Shawn, this is Sophia.
she's so nice.
she's going to help us out.
all right.
I think you've gathered enough people now.
we know where they're holding Kevin.
let's go get him before everyone wakes up.
ready to get out of here?
it's good you came.
they wouldn't give me any sunflower seeds.
I found that agitating.
Hey, Maia. - Hey, Tom.
whatcha doing?
just walking to the bus stop.
Where's my Mom?
Yeah, I'm working solo today.
Diana told me she had an errand she needed to run.
you know, I'm heading your way. Do you want a lift?
sure.
great.
that was kind of weird, huh?
how we just saw each other on the street?
well, to be honest, Maia, it wasn't a coincidence.
I wanted to talk to you about your Mom.
is something wrong?
it's probably nothing, but...
she's been acting funny at work.
I think she's under a lot of stress.
have you noticed anything?
not really.
I guess she's been working hard.
she talks to your new boss all the time.
she even comes over here at night sometimes.
Really?
Hey, do you think I could have a little ice with this soda?
Oh, yeah, sure.
Thanks.
what about visions, Maia?
have you seen anything unusual lately? - No.
anything at all?
no, just little stuff.
yeah?
Thanks.
wait, cheers.
mm, I can't remember the last time I had root beer.
it's good.
well, I guess it's probably nothing.
but you know what, do me a favor, though.
you know, don't tell your Mom we had this little talk.
I don't want her to think that I'm all worried about her.
okay.
you feeling tired, Sweetie? - A little.
Hey, why don't you take a nap?
you know, I can let myself out.
okay.
see you.
it's done.
I gave the girl a massive dose of the inhibitor.
she won't be having any visions for a couple of weeks.
I want this to be fast.
we need be in and out of the center as quickly as Shawn got into promise city.
ground floor...
in the back, as the foyer opens onto the rose garden.
both teams split up inside the foyer...
what's going on?
why does he have bodyguards around him all day?
Shawn came into promise city this morning with another 4400.
they took Kevin Burkhoff.
you're not going to hurt him, are you?
Shawn needs to learn to stay out of our way.
things are going to get...
crazy around here for a while.
I got to get back in there.
I'll come find you later, Okay?
okay.
Curtis Peck dropped out of school in tenth grade.
I think it's safe to assume he doesn't have much grounding in the scientific method.
but when he talks about tiny machines in someone's spinal fluid, there's really only one thing Curtis could mean.
nanites.
nanotechnology. - That's right.
machines built at the molecular level.
tiny machines.
okay, so I haven't read the last couple issues of Scientific American, but as far as I know, nanites are a theoretical technology.
they don't exist.
not yet.
not that we know of, anyway.
look, when someone's marked, one personality takes over another, right?
so, how does that happen?
nanites.
somehow, the personality of the, uh, future guy is encoded in these little machines.
they're injected into someone's cerebrospinal fluid.
they replicate, and once there's enough of them...bam.
you're marked.
so how do you destroy nanites?
I have no idea.
I mean, officially, nobody's even built them yet, much less worried about how to get them out of somebody
Tom, hey.
Hey, guys.
Garrity said you were all down here.
figured I'd join the party.
you said you had that real estate thing.
I didn't know you were back.
Yeah, I saw the place in Lynwood.
we're just debating the pros and cons of, uh...suburbia.
that guy looks stressed.
guess he's a city dweller.
they were here when we got down here.
where have you been?
Ah, just case work.
we've been hearing rumors about a promicin distribution network out at Northmount College.
I was just poking around.
uh, well, I'd better get upstairs.
look, it all comes down to whether you want to put up with a long commute.
Yeah.
yeah...
jordan is nothing if not persistent.
it won't be long before he comes back on us.
maybe we should leave.
he won't hurt Shawn if we're not here.
no, no, no, you're not going anywhere.
collier's already proved that he can find you no matter where you are, so this place is as good as any.
we have 4400s here who believe in what we're doing.
now even people who've taken the shot.
they're willing to protect you.
so, whatever Collier's planning, we'll be ready for him.
Shawn? I'm sorry to interrupt. - It's okay.
but your brother and your mother are waiting downstairs.
okay, um, I'll be right back, okay?
Hey, Mom.
Hey, Danny.
I know we don't have an appointment, but I was out for coffee with your brother, and I figured we'd stop by.
well, good, I'm glad.
it's good to see you guys.
it's just, uh, right now...
it's not a good time?
see, I told you.
I know I always say that, it's just right now is a really bad time.
okay, I get it.
I just wanted to look at you.
I will come by this weekend.
we'll have dinner.
good.
I'll have my people call your people.
Oh, okay.
all right, I'll be waiting for that call.
I'll be there in a minute, okay, Mom?
Joanna, could you just give us a second?
sure. - Thanks.
Bye, mom.
so, I saw you on the news.
hmm, yeah.
you were talking about this promicin compatibility test?
Yeah, we're working on it.
I want to take it.
Shawn, I've had that shot sitting around for months now.
I figured I'd never take it, but this test changes everything, you know?
I could find out whether it's safe or not.
it's just the test isn't really ready yet, Danny.
Yeah, but it's close, right?
I'm just looking for a rough idea of what my odds might be.
well, no school for you tomorrow.
you have a temperature of 101.
when did you start feeling bad?
this afternoon.
Oh, honey.
well, at school?
no.
on the bus ride home.
well, here, you take these...
and we'll take your temperature again in the morning.
who's that?
Hey, sorry to drop by unannounced, but I just had a two-hour phone call with a guy in my graduate school class.
he works at J. P.L. Now.
I asked him how you'd get an infection of Nanites out of someone's body.
Yeah.
first, he laughed at me.
what happened when he got serious?
he said, theoretically, it's possible.
nanites, if they existed, would have a molecular structure, which means their chemical bonds could be broken.
okay, how?
here's where it gets a little dicey.
my friend said the only way you could be sure all the nanites were destroyed would be to expose someone to a highly radioactive substance, something like Polonium.
how much radiation?
about 50 nanograms would do the job.
Tom would die.
I know.
if we really want to kill that thing inside him, we're going to have to kill Tom, too.
so Diana Skouris was definitely a passenger on your flight to Vancouver yesterday?
can you check to see if there was a Meghan Doyle on that same flight?
she was.
Thanks.
Hey, good morning.
morning.
anything going on?
Yeah, actually.
we had a tip on that college promicin case.
a student named Penelope Rice called.
she said her peace studies professor has been lecturing in favor taking the shot.
well, you think he's been supplying the students?
well, I think it's worth taking a look.
you drive.
coming?
Yeah.
you had this cat scan yesterday?
Yeah.
I had to drop Shawn's name to get an appointment, but they took me.
you have a beautiful brain, but I'm afraid you won't be able to help me with the compatibility test.
I don't understand. Why not?
doesn't matter.
he just told you you can't take the shot.
no, no.
that's not what I said.
at this point, the test is almost ready.
I'm just narrowing down who would live and who wouldn't.
I can already answer that for 90% of the population.
it's the middle 10% that I'm focused on.
I have to find that exact dividing line between death and survival.
you...
you're a statistical outlier.
look for yourself.
you have a very prominent corpus collosum.
one of the largest I've ever seen.
so my chances of survival are good?
excellent.
I'd say the shot poses virtually no risk to you at all.
I knew it.
you hear that?
I've got a very prominent corpus collosum.
I'm not stalling.
collier's been surrounded by bodyguards all day.
I can't get anywhere near him.
I'm having a hard time believing that.
it's true.
besides, I don't even know if I can hurt Collier, let alone walk out of here with him.
Isabelle, trust me, you can do whatever you want to Collier.
if he told you otherwise, he was bluffing.
you're forgetting how strong you are, or maybe you're just dragging your feet.
maybe you'd like to pretend you can still be friends with those people, that your time in promise city actually meant something.
it did.
did it mean more to you than your father does?
you need to get this done. You have 24 hours.
what's up?
it's nothing important, just family stuff.
your student informant was a wash.
she called NTAC out here because she was mad at her professor.
he gave her a "C" for the semester.
we could go talk to the guy.
wouldn't hurt to ask some questions.
like what? Why he's such a tough grader?
Nah, I think we should head back.
I have to leave a little early today.
Oh, my god, you're one of them.
you're marked.
is that what they told you?
is what who told me?
Skouris, Doyle. I know they were here.
I just want to finish my movie.
if we wanted you dead, you'd have been gone a long time ago.
we just need to go over what they said.
did they tell you I'm marked?
no, they didn't mention you at all.
they just asked me how to get rid of one of those things, if there's a way to take a mark out of somebody.
so they're going to try to save Tom Baldwin.
I don't know, but it's got nothing to do with me.
I didn't tell them anything!
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.
look, it's okay.
it's okay...
I'm not mad, Curtis.
we just have to be thorough, that's all.
what else did they ask you?
nothing.
that's all we talked about.
okay.
okay...
can I go home now?
I told you, I didn't say anything.
what are you doing?
you're a filmmaker.
you should appreciate what I'm about to do.
call it...getting rid of a plot hole.
No!
Tom, what are you doing?
you scared me, Diana.
it's after midnight. Why are you still here?
I was just down in the theory room, and now I'm on my way out.
so, what's going on?
Oh, I'm just taking some work home with me.
that's a lot of work.
Yeah.
Well...good night, honey.
you know, Tom, I can't let you leave with those files.
why not?
okay, yeah, there's some sensitive stuff in here, but it's you and me, Diana.
we take work home all the time.
it's no big deal, right?
you know, you're just so bad at this.
I don't know what lessons you took in bodysnatching school, but you make a terrible Tom Baldwin. You're so insincere.
very funny, Diana. I'd laugh, but it's late
you're marked, Tom. I know it.
meghan knows it.
okay...
just for a second, let's pretend I am.
do you have any idea how hard it would be to pretend you're someone from this place?
you're all weak, vacillating.
we're human beings.
I...I don't know how we evolved into you.
neither do I.
neither do I. I mean, look at you, Diana.
you have no idea what you want.
you've driven away every man who's ever looked at you.
your daughter hand delivered you a fiance by prophecy, and you couldn't even hold onto him.
the longest relationship you've ever had with a guy? It's with me.
your good old buddy, Tom Baldwin.
I am friends with him, and I'm not even going to ask him to apologize once I've burned you out of him.
Yeah, you should get some rest, Diana. You're starting to sound delusional.
put the files down now, Tom.
Diana, what...
fine.
Isabelle? What are you doing here?
you never came to see me.
Oh, sorry, I got tied up with Jordan.
are you okay?
I don't want to be alone tonight.
well, it's okay, you can stay here.
and I don't want to talk either.
are you sure you don't want me to call a doctor?
I'm fine, Marco.
I just got a call from the Vancouver police.
Curtis Peck was found murdered a couple of hours ago.
Oh, my god.
they're thinking maybe it was a robbery. I gave them no reason to believe otherwise.
God knows what he's going to do next.
okay, I don't want to ratchet up the pressure or anything, but if we're going to, uh, cure Tom, we're going to have to do it fast.
my guy was able to get me a sample of polonium, but it degrades quickly.
in a couple days, it'll be useless.
Tom knows we're onto him. There's no way he's coming back to NTAC.
we have to have to find a way to lure him to us.
I always hated needles.
are you okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, I feel fine, actually.
well, that doesn't mean you're free and clear.
we got to keep an eye on you for a while, Okay? - Okay.
but I feel good.
you're just wondering what kind of ability you're going to get.
well, the world could always use another healer, right?
Kyle, wake up.
how did you sleep?
I've been awake all night.
I have to go.
it's time.
time for what?
you're going to go to sleep for a while, and when you wake up, everything's going to be different.
what are you talking about?
I want you to know, all the things I felt for you were real.
this is the only real friendship I've ever had.
Isabelle, are you okay?
for a while there, I believed you'd changed.
so did I.
MAIA, honey, you need to get up.
how are you feeling?
a bit better. - Okay?
I just don't think I can go to school.
well, that's okay, but you need to get dressed, and we need to pack you a little bag, because we're going someplace for a while.
where?
well, just a hotel.
what happened to your eye?
well, it's...I'm，I'm okay.
we're just going to go to a place, because it's not safe here.
I don't want to frighten you, but it's...
it's Tom. He's, um...
he's just got something bad inside him, and he's just not himself. All right?
so, come on, we need to get going.
I don't understand.
that's what tom said about you.
what?
when?
a couple of days ago, he picked me up at school.
a couple of days ago?
that was right before you started feeling sick, right?
wake him up.
what do you want with me?
Hello, Jordan.
looks like you and I will be working together after all.
it won't do you any good to kill me.
the movement's too strong. It'll go on without me.
who said anything about killing you?
this is a sedative.
we're not going to make you a martyr to your cause, Jordan.
we're going to make you a traitor to it.
you're going to go to sleep for a while, and when you wake up, there's going to be something inside you, and in time, you'll come to think exactly the way we do.
you'll be a brand-new Jordan Collier
a man concerned with protecting the future, instead of destroying it.
you forget, I've seen the world you created, and the oceans were deserts of bone, fires filled the horizon, and everywhere I walked, there was screaming.
we inherited that world, and we managed to survive, and even prosper.
all you people did was build a wall to hide behind while the rest of the planet died around you.
it doesn't matter what you do, you'll never get your future back.
the world is turning positive.
you're right, Jordan.
we're helpless...
but you're not.
you can take promicin out of people.
you can turn positives into negatives.
your ability, Jordan, that's how we're going to win.
once you're marked, you'll gather all your followers around you, and then one by one, you're going to take their abilities away, and you're not going to stop until you rid the world of promicin.
Oh, look, Jordan Collier has nothing to say.
you have to admire the symmetry.
you're going to single-handedly destroy the movement you created.
you lied to me.
you told me that we needed Isabelle. You said she changed.
I said you had to bring her to Collier, that she was a part of all this, and she is.
she's doing what she has to do.
you need to do the same.
how? Jordan is gone.
you can't let that happen, Kyle.
somebody has to be in charge of promise city now.
me?
Hello?
Tom, it's me, Maia.
MAIA, Hi.
is everything all right?
I don't think so. It's my Mom.
I'm worried about her.
she's acting weird.
weird how?
she took me to this hotel.
she said that there's something wrong with you.
that's not true, Maia. I'm sorry she told you that.
what else did she say?
nothing.
don't get mad, but when you came to see me, I didn't tell the truth.
I did have a vision last week.
you and my mom were in it. It was bad.
it's okay, Maia, whatever it is, it hasn't happened yet.
just tell me what you saw.
my mom, she had a gun, and you guys were arguing.
then she shot you.
I didn't say anything when you came to see me, because I didn't think it could come true.
but now I'm not so sure.
where did this happen, Maia? I need details.
I couldn't tell.
she'd be so mad if she knew I was calling you.
be careful, okay?
and please, don't do anything to hurt her.
just tell me what the place looked like, Maia, just
you missed lunch.
I did?
is it still day?
it's 3: 00 in the afternoon.
Kevin, I know you're busy with your test, but...
it seems, ever since Shawn healed me, I never see you anymore.
are you avoiding me?
actually, yes.
as much as possible. - Why?
because you're healthy now, and...
you're young, and...
I'm not exactly either of those things.
you don't need me to take care of you anymore, so I'm trying to...
give you space.
how could you be so brilliant, and so clueless?
why would I want space?
where am I going to find another you?
well, I...
I suppose that would be a challenge.
I'd like you...
to go visit your grandniece again.
it's not safe here anymore.
I'm a target, and as long as you're with me, you will be, too, and when this is over, when I perfect the test,
I'll come find you.
how do I know that you will?
how could I not?
where would I find another you?
don't move, Tom.
put the gun down or I will shoot you.
MEGHAN, please.
MEGHAN, honey, it's me.
please, you have to help me.
this thing inside me, I'm trying to fight it...
but it hurts... sometimes it hurts so much.
get down on the floor and put your hands behind your head.
Oh, god!
Tom, freeze! Freeze!
here you go. - Thank you.
you're welcome.
do you think your brother looks a little thin? Tired?
I'm worried about him.
mom, I didn't come here to talk about Shawn.
there's something I want to tell you.
I took the shot.
mom, it worked out. I'm fine.
I was afraid you would.
as soon as I heard about that test your brother's working on,
I knew you'd be first in line.
mom, this is a good thing.
the world is changing.
there are miracles out there.
I'm going to be part of it now.
just like your brother's part of it.
Yeah, I guess.
I mean, why should he have a gift and not me, right?
mom, you okay?
mom! Mom, what's wrong?
mom! Mom!
Just...someone, help, please!
mom, no!
where did he go?
I guess he went around back.
don't move!
drop the gun.
don't make me shoot you.
you going to fix me, Diana?
going to get your old tom back?
how do you think that'll help things?
I'm a better NTAC agent now than I've ever been.
ever since I, uh, re-evaluated things
put your hands in the air!
keep them where I can see them.
okay.
I've made more progress against Jordan Collier and promicin than we made in a year.
we're winning now, Di. Isn't that what you want?
not like this.
you killed Curtis Peck, you put my daughter on the inhibitor... my daughter, Tom.
you still call me by that name.
deep down, you must know we're still partners, that we're on the same side.
tell you what I'm going to do now, Diana.
I'm going to turn around, walk out that door, and you won't be able to pull that trigger.
goddammit, Tom, stop!
OK, recent studies have shown that one in four men cheats on their wives.
and one in ten women, cheats on their husbands.
ray, I will explain.
hey man, I'm so sorry...
now that's aweful. Truly depressing data.
I know this must look bad, but it's not what it looks like.
you, stop talking now. - Okay.
Dorothy, you see the red Potiac Fierro outside?
he works for your husband.
but then I realized, imagine how much more impressive those numbers could be, if people thought they could actually get away with it?
here put these up
two minutes, out the door. I will take care of the photographer.
you, ten minutes after that, half a mile down the road there's an Exxon garage call a cab.
cynical? Well, I prefer entrepreneurial.
my former partner, the Great Jack McCadden taught me, our job in life is not to judge the ones and desires of our fellow men is to profit upon them.
and well, some might see this as an unravelling of our social fabric
I say business is good.
ray - Ray, my files are ready
do me a favour, will you?
double check the receipts for the Feing account.
I'm super sorry about the other night, Ray. I just lost her.
it's not good enough, Vic.
that's the third time in the last three months.
ray, we deed three dollars for Wendy's birthday cake.
that is two months severance.
you need any contacts, we'll hook you up.
we've got some issues with the new DMV holographs.
give it to Walter.
do you want to sign off on the new souvenirs?
track me down this afternoon.
ray I need approval on the travel account.
I did it, it's on your desk.
ray, this OK? - Good.
new client?
your eleven o'clock. you said you wanted bigger brains around here.
don't let the twins fool you.
they may look affectionate, but they're actually in a battle for tank dominance.
they also like to breed under banana leafs.
you can call me Lola.
OK, let's go by - Ray?
Benjamin's root canal is going over.
also Peter Miller's pass code isn't scanning the rhythm...
and I will talk to you about it later.
so Lola, do you have any lunch plans?
you worked under Randall Pual. Can I ask why you left?
I was one of seventeen Jr. VPs in out division specializing interest derivatives, market risk exposure, plus a little P/L analyses on the side.
sounds... - almost as dull as it was.
and just a point of clarification, I work with people, and for people, never under them.
and what would you say Your best quality?
my patience. - Great, great.
so, how close to the street are you?
your shoes. Very fashionable about five or six years ago.
you look like a woman who would care.
do you wanna talk about it? - OK
I had banked some stock options from this blossoming internet start-up, and decided to seek enlightenment in the Holy land.
I would have guessed Tibet...
I'm old school.
can I ask you a question?
what exactly do you do?
well this is a surprise.
putty. Good to see you. - How the fuck are you, man?
fucking good.
getting any work?
I'm Retired.
I banked some stock options from this blossoming internet start-up, then decided to seek enlightenment in Tibet... by the middle East.
the Holy land, huh? No shit.
ray
I hear Jack's back on the radar.
well, I wouldn't know about that.
no? Don't keep in touch with your old boss?
you guys were like...Batman and Robin.
without the capes, of course.
I hear he was seen at the airport he's hiding out in a bangalow just up the coast.
Yeah, I heard it was a villa in Sweden.
I wouldn't put too much stock in idle gossip.
nothing idle about a 5 million dollar contract on the guy's head.
excuse me, Sir? We need to keep this lane clear.
I was looking for some good guys.
ma'am
fuck are you looking at?
that was interesting, little creepy.
so what can you tell me about him? - I just met him.
I'd say high school graduate, possibly a missionary or insurance salesman although with obvious connections to some sort of criminal enterprise.
okay, what else?
so you know this, or you've heard this?
I know that Jack McCadden conned the Sultan Qatar out of 15 million dollars.
yeah that's the legend.
what about this Ray fellow?
he was always just the frontman Word is after the score
Jack disappeared with Ray's cut of the Sultan's cash.
a Sultan? That's some real Indiana Jones shit that is.
language Bobo. - Sorry - And would you say he is... - Married or single?
divorced.
if there were a woman's life she'd make him a babe little more with him
excuse me.
so is this Sultan still want Jack bit?
what I hear, 5 million open contract on Jack McCadden's head.
5 million's a lot of money.
to clip a gifter, it certainly is.
OK, where is he now?
no no no, I will take it.
so, when can you start?
you asked me two questions and offer me the job?
Ah, three.
I have sense about people. We have to leave.
now.
seems like our new friend Ray knows a very valuable man.
I don't know if Ray is still in touch.
he's handsome.
I think he's found religion.
what good is it for man to have faith, if his actions do not prove it.
con men don't reform.
they simply find better angles.
OK What do we do? We're a risk management firm.
which means? - We're in the business of saving marriages.
how do you do that?
we grease the way that makes state-of-the-art infidelity possible.
people who cheat get caught because, A they want to, or B they're found somewhere they said they weren't.
Goodmorning Jay Z Incorporated?
mr Williams is in meeting right now, may I take a message?
we create a false reality, making people appear to be where they're supposed to be.
Adams and Randalph.
mr North? Let me check.
I'm sorry, your wife just got on a conference call.
I will try it when she gets off.
fifth precinct.
Sykes? He's running files to central. Can I help you?
I can try him on his walkie if it's an emergency.
so you help men cheat on their wives?
and wives cheat on their husbands.
we're an equal opportunity employer.
you're a professional liar.
lies are the great foundation of our society, Lola.
great outfit, honey.' 'Can't I give you flowers for no reason?'
and my personal favorite, 'Don't worry, it happens to lots of guys.'
but that's just being polite.
fact is your average relationship wouldn't last two minutes if people told the truth.
we just help maintain the illusion.
mom's happy, Dad's happy and the kids don't have to pick sides at Christmas.
so this is all for the children, then?
families don't break up because of infidelity,
thank you.
they break up because someone get caught.
let me guess,
you're just a hard-working child of a broken home trying to save others from the pain you went through.
I just see people for the well dressed, good smelling animals they are.
mate, eat, sleep and mate some more, preferably with someone else. Come on.
but you can't really believe that.
not everyone operate on a purely primal level.
a man is as faithful as his opportunities. Take your old boss, for example.
perfect example. Yes, he cheated on his wife they broke up
they got back together they never been happier
when was that, about a year ago?
Yeah, How did you know that?
he just bought us lunch. Been a client since January.
are you ready?
I'll let you know.
you dare defy your emperor!
Robert? Lobby, two minutes.
and you might want to put the jacket on.
morning?
you ever consider a more traditional line of work?
insurance? Sales?
making money's easy.
keeping yourself interested is something else entirely.
OK here's the situation.
in a few seconds, an angry wife is going to steaming through that door and raise Mary hell till she finds her cheating husband.
inside this is a cheap knock-off necklace.
you can be anyone you want to be for the next five minutes.
I need two thousand a week, benefits and a month off plus all the regular holidays.
we tend to work holidays, we've got great dental and I can go as high as 1, 500.
what's going on here, Ray?
hey how ya doing there? - One second, vision?
that comes with a co-pay.
OK, the objective is to extricate him from this situation with his balls intact.
Ray...
son of a bitch...
holy shit. - How could you!
I give you the best years of my life and you go and throw it away to have your sick sex with some whore.
I don't know who you think you think you are, Mrs. Hatch, but no one speaks to me like that.
I can't work like this, Mr. Hatch.
we are Rogette's jewelers, not Bob's Big House of Diamonds.
diamonds?
to my dearest on this special day.
much love.
but why are you meeting here?
our office is in New york, so
Mr. Hatch has been flying in members of our team to work on the design
Robert...
do you like it?
Robert...
I think this concludes our business, Mr Hatch.
so if I want to examine some other items from your catalogue, how could we arrange that?
I can have a catalogue forwarded to your hotel room in Fiji.
you didn't tell her?
Robert!
we need to go to Rodeo Drive, Hannibal. - Yes, Mrs. Hatch.
Mr. Hatch needs new swim togs.
and in the future, I'd rather you didn't improvise travel arrangements.
I was in the moment.
I'll also need a cell phone.
and moment or not, you didn't have to make it a private island.
we both know he had it coming.
company car?
I guess anyone can get away with anything these days.
no we don't alibi crimes,
I will not be an instrument of recrimination or revenge.
beyond that... - Beyond that?
it's all smoke and mirrors.
so how rich do people have to be to hire us?
we give discounts to cops, plumbers, hotel workers and teachers.
nice to give something back to the chronically under-paid.
if it makes you feel better, sometimes our clients stray but then they go back a little wiser for the experience.
anything else?
overtime, dress code?
Yes, for both.
do we have a deal?
if I'm there for more than a year, I want profit sharing.
OK on one condition.
don't slap the spouse.
don't micromanage.
profit sharing?
perhaps that was a bit much.
but I was temporarily seduced by her lavish penetrating, truly sublime attention to detail.
you see my current line of work is all about planning for every conceivable contingency
accounting for every detail.
every nuance, and every possible mistake.
I know exactly where he is.
Why?
because I commit the one unpardonable sin.
the one my old partner Jack would never abide.
I'm forced, on a daily basis to rely on the intelligence of others
ten days, Ray.
ten days I had sleep with my wife. You got any idea how that is?
break the rules, these thing happen.
by the way, you'll be swapping the necklace
you gave her with a real one in about two days.
I've already billed your account.
you realize I actually had to...
I shudder just thinking about it.
you could always leave her, Robert.
hey I'd leave, I'd leave in a heartbeat, it's no secret the money's all from her family.
I leave, I'm ruined you know that.
we all have our crosses to bear, right? Now, for our lesson in remedial cheating.
those damned matches. Stupid habit.
I just keep losing my lighters.
nothing from your liaisons goes in your pockets, on your breath or on your skin. Got it?
Robert? you've already met Lola.
my son's getting married next month.
good girl from a good family.
but you know the Hatch men...
you know, we always have a little something on the side that my grandfather, my father, me and now my kid, can you believe it?
amazing.
so, where's he not supposed to be going and who's he not supposed to be going with?
ray, I'd appreciate it if you handled this yourself.
Robert, apart for the odd emergency,
I do very little fieldwork these days.
you're my last personal client.
yeah but I was your first client.
think of it as a wedding present to my fucking kid.
one you get to bill for. After that, Lola takes care of me.
OK?
OK.
don't let the Hatch thing bother you. Some clients just prefer working with men.
so that man was your first client?
that man's libido paid the rent for the first few months.
what? No start-up help from the infamous Jack McCadden?
no.
he sounds like quite the character.
international man of intrigue. Smart, handsome.
how long did you two date?
okay, Jack is not a topic I care to discuss.
bad break up?
drop it.
dropped.
she wants a friar to marry us.
a fucking friar, like what am I, Robin Hood?
look, don't get me wrong. I love Sandy. I fucking worship her.
shit. "Till death do us part?"
men aren't wired to be monogamous. I'm sorry
you know, we gotta spread the seed.
your father tells me You want to go away for the weekend?
that's terrible, right? I'm a terrible person.
I don't know you, Wendell.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
alright, so this girl, do I tell you her name? - No.
alright, she wants to go to a bed and breakfast in Santa Barbara.
are Click and Clack going too?
what?
no dude. Just me and her.
OK. There's a brokers' convention in San Francisco this weekend.
I'll book you a room in San Francisco under your name and reserve a flight and a rental car.
OK.
then I will book a room in Santa Barbara under my name and give you a credit card to use while you're up there.
friday, you go to Santa Barbara and I go to San Francisco, where I check into your room and sign in at the convention.
I have dinner, make phone calls.
in short, you become me and I become you.
temporarily.
and when Sandy tries to call me?
we intercept all the calls.
if there's an emergency I'll be contacted and I will contact you.
shit.
dude, do you have a card?
I don't.
anything else? No, I'm good.
good.
Wendell.
in the future, don't make me do this in front of your wife.
it's kind of tacky...
and it'll get you caught. Guaranteed.
it'd be easy for a man in my line of work to become cynical on the subject of relationships
so what's in San Francisco?
it's business.
what's her name?
Lola, I prefer to keep my work life and my private life separate.
it keeps things simple. - Simple is boring.
boring is safe.
and safe is for old people.
this is fun, want to keep going?
I got a plane to catch.
have a good weekend?
but you see, romance is my greatest ally.
that makes people vulnerable. Distracts it, and utterly idiotic.
you sure, you didn't tell anyone?
in short, perfect clients.
we've been over this a thousand times.
what did you tell your boyfriend?
that I'm visiting my mom.
trust me, he's an idiot.
so after the wedding, how long before we can get together?
I don't know we might have to cool it for a little...
Oh shit, does your boyfriend drive a black SUV?
no.
will you calm down?
did you ever get a blow job at a hundred miles an hour?
we're only going sixty.
then you better step on it.
Hey, hey.
one second!
you've got about ten seconds before I rip off all your clothes and fuck you right here in the lobby.
can't wait to do that.
now, what can I do for you nice young people?
we have a room booked. Under Elliottt. Mr. And Mrs. Ray Elliottt.
Hi. Wendell Hatch, arrogant prick.
Wendell
hi Wendell Hatch, good to meet you.
hi Wendell.
hello.
you son of a bitch.
takes one to know one, Mr. Williams.
good to see you.
God, didn't we have a hell of a time in Bermuda?
my liver's still not talking to me.
they forget to print you a name tag?
that's what you get for pre-registering.
say Michael, you ever talk to that tax shelter guy
what was his name, Jack something?
no I was hoping you could tell me
I got so much loose change tied up with that guy.
now I can't get the bastard on the phone.
so you know what Jack used to say the only sure investment is tombstone.
I know what it means.
come on I want you to meet somebody. Hey Jimmy!
come on.
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
that was amazing.
all tingling.
hello.
Hey, sugar, how's work going?
Nope, just hanging out with my sister.
you want to say hi?
hang on...
sorry, Babe, she's in the bathroom.
Yeah, me too.
study hard.
what are you doing? You tring to get me killed?
have you...
now, while we let the little blue pills kick in, it's my turn.
OK, now what...
you could have scratched me. - The closer I get, the harder you pull.
okay. But what if I hurt you?
Yes, please.
fine, the safety word is 'gum'
okay.
Hello? - Ray?
who is this?
I think she's dead, Ray.
I don't...she's not waking up.
Wendell? - Hell fucked. This is so FUCKED.
okay Wendell, get a hold of yourself.
she, you know, she liked it rough.
I just, I thought I was...
she didn't say 'gum' Ray
I was listening, she never said 'gum'!
Wendell, did you check her pulse?
she's blue. That's not normal, right?
listen to me. Check her pulse. Do you know how to do that?
I gotta get out of here. I can't stay here.
now Wendell, you must not leave the room. Do you hear?
you need to call an ambulance. It was an accident.
I can't go to jail I'm not going to jail.
if I fucking call an ambulance.
this whole thing comes out, do you understand me?
you, your business, my father, Your clients, this whole thing.
you gonna be ruined. - Well It wouldn't be the first time.
bull-shit. you work for me, goddamn it You have to do what I say Ray.
it doesn't work like that Wendell?
you gotta help me please.
please don't make me beg, man.
please help me.
okay I'll call you back in five minutes. Don't fucking move.
Bobo, get increase on your money.
just little bit.
putty.
Hello?
Hello?
hey Putty, it's Ray.
you up for a little freelance work?
ray?
someone's coming to solve this out.
Oh Jesus Christ, thank you so much, Thank you.
now Wendell, this is very important, so please pay attention,
okay.
when he gets there, do NOT give him Your real name, do you understand?
I'm Wendell. I mean Pete.
hey Wendell.
she come with the room? - What?
did the dead girl come with the room - or did you bring her here yourself? - It was an accident.
usually is. - No, it was her idea.
I doubt that.
so no one saw you moved the body?
no.
Wendell. Wendell, look at me.
did anybody know you were taking her out of town?
no. I mean, the guys knew I was going, but they didn't know who.
is anyone likey come looking for her?
she has a Mexican.
she has a boyfriend who is Mexican
he is a Hispanic-American, but he would fucking kill us both if he knew.
the guy at the bed and breakfast saw me. I think he saw me.
you know this was all her idea. - Shut up, Wendell.
did you have any idea? You killed a girl.
I'm sorry, believe me. Fuck you think I want this to happen?
look, the good thing is it's your name on the town bill, right?
not mine, so technically I wasn't even there.
you're not gonna tell my dad, are you?
give me my credit card.
okay get moving
and don't, ever ever let me see you again.
Hello, is this the number for reporting a lost credit card?
Yeah.
ray Elliott.
hello.
I know what you are thinking but a deal is a deal.
darling, you should really try and give me a little more notice.
come on in.
sorry to interrupt. Are you busy?
Yes, Ray, I was having a glamour night.
I'm goint to...
I'm going to tell you something and I don't want you to ask any questions.
well, we all know how good I am at that.
we slept together last night.
did I like it?
I said no questions, remember?
did you like it? - Lola.
how do you know I wasn't with someone else last night?
were you?
I thought the idea was to keep our private life and work life separate?
okay, go ahead.
you invited me over yesterday morning.
I showed up at seven-thirty PM with a bottle of wine.
what kind? - Merlot.
and you cooked me dinner.
don't tell this story my mother. She'll know you're making it up.
a roast.
lasagna. I can make lasagna.
fine, lasagna.
I showed up at seven-thirty, we had dinner and I didn't leave until nine o'clock in the morning.
just one more question.
what?
are you gonna call me?
so you are the only one that put my kid and that fucking girl together at the bed and breakfast.
plus the inn keeper but
I don't see how anyone's gonna register in the cop's radar.
so how much do you want to make this go away?
that's not what this is about.
I will give you 23 grand cash right now to keep my kid out of it.
hey that's what I've got. My emergency cash reserve.
Robert, I don't want your money.
Hello, leaving the fucking conversation.
our actions have consequences. Yours, mine, everyone's.
wait a minuite.
if this is some kind of con Ray
I pay up, and this chick shows up with my 23 grand on some beach somewhere.
no way, no fucking way.
she's dead
your son killed her. Deal with it.
so that I don't have to.
okay Ray.
I will see what I can do.
this is Carol. - Hey it's Ray.
you working this weekend?
come on man, you know that I never sleep.
so I heard my old friend might be in town.
you heard anything? - You mean Jack McCadden?
I've been waiting to call you.
he just came in.
and now, direct from an extended tour where he played for and with many of the crown'ed heads of Arabia and their wives...
cam? Is this a joke?
what?
that's not Jack McCadden.
are you sure?
same age, same build?
but here's the thing Jack doesn't have a snake tatooed on his face.
or a steel bolt through his penis.
I gotta go.
can I help you?
detective Bryce to see Mr. Elliott.
sorry! Never seen her before.
right.
and your credit card was stolen or lost just the day before it was used to check in to the Bed and Breakfast.
neat how that worked out, isn't it?
you're not LAPD, are you? - Used to be. I'm in Santa Barbara, now.
that's where the prices and their occationally wayward daughter live.
what exactly do you do here at Elliott Consulting, Mr. Elliott?
risk assessment and management.
as a former confidence man become an expert on that?
the same way you got to Carnegie Hall, Detective.
practice, practice, practice.
where is Ms. Price, Mr. Elliott?
or should I call you Mr. Avalon, Mr. Morgan, Mr. Weil.
detective, I swear to God - What about your old boss Jack McCadden? Would he know?
I heard this crazy story the other day about a really rich Arab wanting to see Jack McCadden dead.
I haven't talked to Jack in couple of years.
now when grifters and cons knock each other off,
I really don't gice a shit.
but Ms. Price's father is an assemblyman, and he's pushing really us hard to fine his daughter.
it's how it works, he pushes me, I push you. We find her,
then I get to go home to my husband who I'm pretty sure letting our daughter overdoes on pizza every night I'm out of town.
that sounds painfully domestic. - To me, it's a little piece of heaven.
now you make me stick around this town,
I'm gonna do my damndest to just make sure that I find something to make it worthy my while.
for my scrapbook.
you know you don't have to waive those things dry anymore.
it's a new process they've had it for a couple of years now.
download this, will you please.
what did the cop want? - It's nothing.
I'm going to need you to cover some of my accounts for the next few weeks.
not a problem. - Good.
Hey, Ray.
putty, how nice to see you.
gotta go for a ride. - Holding me up for that B and B thing?
that's not like you.
I'm hurt you'd even think such a thing.
I take this is not optional? - That's a real good way to put it.
so who you working for these days?
guy used to run out of Salt Lake.
the Mormon?
you heard of him? Really nice guy.
I've heard of at least six guys who'd argue that point, if they were still around.
eh, don't really keep track.
but me and Bobo get benefits; dental, eyecare...
nice uniforms? - Nice uniforms.
I remember you. - Do you?
I'm Adelle. - Please to meet you.
and you are?
too old.
do you have a bathroom?
it's a little crowded in here right now.
I may be married to the old creep, but he doesn't own me.
well that's good to know, so where you from, young lady?
south Dakota. Tiny little town.
how are you enjoying life in the big city?
yeah right.
it's like being in prison with a nice pool.
but...
I do manage to find the odd distraction.
bridge?
come on. Let's do it right here.
are you insane? - It wasn't my idea.
doesn't matter who's 'idea' it was.
he'll tear your head off You go near one of his wives.
you dragged me here, remember? So, let's get this audience underway?
I spent a fortune for landscaping, but I think it's worth it.
it's very beautiful.
thank you.
putty tells me you've met one of my wives.
how does that work anyway? The two...
three.
Congratulations.
our Doctrine says 'Celestial marriage is the gate to excaltation.'
sorry, do they work in shifts or is this more of a group effort?
things manage to work themselves out.
but enough about me. Are you married?
no.
I guess I just haven't met the right women.
funny.
I've heard there's a price on the head of your old partner Jack.
I've also heard he maybe in town.
and you want me to tell you where he is?
you know my chosen profession, right? - Yes.
people have been hiring hitmen for thousands of years.
ever since some Neanderthal gave some other Neanderthal half a mastodon to clock his brother with a rock.
Neanderthals? I would have taken you for a creationist.
more of a pragmatist, really.
which is where you come in.
do I?
I think having a man of your skills covering my tracks would be extremely helpful.
well I'm sorry but I don't alibi crimes.
you alibied one.
for the Hatch family, wasn't it?
that was the first and last.
Oh, I think not.
I think from now on there will be many, many more.
unless becoming an accessory after the fact strikes you as a reasonable way to spend the next ten to fifteen years of your life.
good evening Ray, we'll be in touch.
the genious of Jack McCadden was that he was part magician part artist, part ghost.
ray, Jack's back on the radar.
you guys were like Batman and Robin.
although it was a previlege to work alongside him
what was his name, Jack something?
I've gone to great pains to leave that life behind.
Jack McCadden, would he know?
so I hear there's a price on the head of your old partner.
but that's the problem with the past.
bad breakup?
it's never really dead until you are.
dropped.
that's not a very comforting thought.
Yeah.
dude, it's Cam. I think I found Jack.
cam, I can't really deal with this right now. Something came up.
but if it is him people are gonna come looking for him.
hey asshole.
ah no it's just there's little thing that I need to deal with.
I will call you later.
Bye.
Wendell. Wendell's posse.
you dick, I can't believe you told my dad.
somebody needed to straight things out.
I don't know who you think you are, but you don't threaten me and you don't threaten my father.
you're a fucking employee, you understand me? you are a burtler.
you are a berger flipper.
so let's step outside and get this party started.
what is that? Is that sort of Kung Fu?
Tae Kwon Doe.
Oh Tae Kwon Doe.
why do we do it here? It's a little cramped in here.
if you move those two chairs. And I will shift this table...
Hey!
that's what I'm talking about.
you want some more of this, pal? - No.
Wendell. I don't want to get all philosophical but a person's life has been taken, and someone has to account for that.
do you follow me?
please don't kill me, I'll pay you.
go, go, go!
come on!
stupid, asshole. I think you broke my fucking nose.
I think I did.
using your intellect is nice but nothing beats the thrill of delievering a good old fashioned...
what's wrong with that guy?
okay come on, get in.
wakey, wakey.
look who's up. Look who's up.
I thought you were gonna sleep forever, princess.
I think there's been a mistake.
my house is that way.
this ain't no car service, motherfucker. This is your worst nightmare.
well, my worst nightmare has rats in it.
well, we're gonna get to that. Gurantee hat.
I know you. - Oh, you think so?
you're Hatch's driver.
that's right asshole and what is that supposed to mean?
you think you are better than me? You trying to put me down man?
what the fuck, let me suggest something to you.
I suggest you get real smart real fast and tell me where the fuck she is?
look you better get smart.
don't be annoyed but, who?
Heather.
Heather Price, motherfucker. Do you remember her now?
little B-cup, ass like butter, right? Mind like fucking pervert.
you took her to that hotel in Santa Barbara.
let me tell you something, she's my fucking girlfriend, man.
H. It wasn't a hotel man, it was bed and breakfast, you shut the fuck up and drive, keep attention man.
I wasn't at that hotel, I reported my credit card stolen.
I spent weekend with friends Check it out with any of them.
you expect somebody believe that bullshit.
is that your best shot? It's the truth.
come on, give me something before
I get me to engage my suspension of disbelief
give me something, man.
something within the realm of Plausibility.
she wouldn't be cheating on me, man.
no matter what she's done or why she's ducking me
I have the capacity to forgive.
unfortunately, tonight is not going to be salvation to your fucking ass.
do you want me to get extreme cranial makeover on your ass.
where is she?
say something!
listen, if you want to beat information out of someone, you gotta be smart enough to let them answer.
alright point taken, back off man, back off.
now where is she?
go ahead. - She's...
she's dead.
I didn't do it. - She can't man.
you can kill me if you want to, but it won't change what went down.
you do it? - No. No I didn't.
do you know who fucking did it?
Wendell Hatch.
he was having an affair with her. He came to me to help him set up an alibi.
no way. Can't fucking be Wendell Hatch man.
the man is bullshitting man.
couldn't be a little ain't no worth.
think about it, Hannibal.
weren't there times when she wanted to meet people you never met?
what! - Just kill him right now.
she wanted to take shower before she was with you. She ever do that?
jewelry! Did she have a new jewelry a bracelet or necklace?
talk to me.
he's fucking right.
I caught her. I caught her with big-assed diamond ear rings.
shit is right man.
happens more often than you think.
I know where he lives.
remember, what about that time when we went to Jino party and I told you we seen it...
don't do it, Hannibal. There's a better way.
better than shooting his ass?
better than you going to jail to avenge a girl who was fucking around on you.
better than you throwing away what you've got going on for a third strike that'll get you the needle.
a needle motherfucker, what do you know about me man?
what do you know about me you don't know me man.
the ink says you've been inside.
and I know you drive for Hatch to pay for your tuition fees.
you promise he goes down? - I can make it happen.
better make it happen. If he walks,
I'm gonna finish it in my way. You follow me?
you've made yourself very clear.
so I wanted to.
I said you made yourself very clear.
almost kept my first one in there. - Told you there were rats, mother fucker.
excuse me.
Hello?
ray, my friend. Is this a bad time?
it is a very bad time.
can you come by?
I was hoping we could firm up some dates for our business.
I can't tonight.
I've got... I've got laundry.
tomorrow then.
Oh, by the way, a gentleman contacted me regarding you this afternoon.
what did he want? - He wanted me to take you out.
I'm pretty sure I'm not your type.
it wasn't some sodomite tea party, Ray.
what did you say?
I said it was out of the question as we have unfinished business, you and I.
what did he offer you?
a man should always know his worth.
your asking price is twenty three thousand.
tell Hatch you'll take it.
very impressive. But suicide is still a sin Ray.
if you take the constract at least I know he won't be hiring anyone else.
you know, if I had Jack McCadden's whereabouts, you and I might never need to speak again.
five million dollars buys a lot of forgiveness.
I'll see you tomorrow.
shit.
lucky for you I didn't make any other plans tonight.
what happened?
opera?
what happened?
I was car jacked.
doubtful.
care to try again?
it was Hatch's driver.
why would he come after you?
it's better if you don't know.
I think I can decide what I can handle.
well?
it was Hatch's son.
he spent last weekend in Santa Barbara where he killed his date.
and I...we were on the job.
I got that guy Putty to take care of it.
and now the cops are all over me and a very bad man has been hired to kill me.
you sure this job is worth it?
it's not normally this bad.
you ever consider asking your old partner for help?
it's not so easy. - Why?
because you are Jack McCadden?
it makes a certain amount of sense.
what that guy putty said, your trip to San Francisco.
how much it must have cost to set up your company.
plus you calling Jack your boss when I really can't see you ever working for anyone.
a woman can tell when a man lies, Ray
if she's paying attention and if she really wants to know.
and if I can figure it out I might not be the only one.
it's funny.
you think I'm Jack, the detective thinks I killed Jack and the Mormon thinks I know where Jack is hiding out.
so who's right?
I know you won't believe me Ray, but not everyone is working an angle.
well...
that maybe. But for five million dollars, somebody might take a chance.
then I suppose you have a choice to make.
I suppose I do.
you look like a man with a problem.
several.
care to add to the burden?
I need an alibi for Thursday night. Something extremely sturdy.
well the only absolutely air-tight alibi is death.
what's happening Thursday night?
let me explain something.
it helps if I know where you are going to be, so I can pretend you're somewhere else.
honey?
fine. I'll be at the Ellroy Hotel.
but that's all you get.
and where would you want to pretend to be?
does it matter?
it's your neck.
thank you, Adelle.
how about this?
how about if I write you a check right now and you forget we ever met?
do you have five million in your checking account?
unless you're trying to tell me Jack is already a non-issue?
you wouldn't have me waste my time looking for a man who's already passed on to the greater celestial court, would you?
anything else, Ray?
not right now. No.
so... is this a social call?
business, actually.
I've heard you want my boss dead.
excuse me? - Please, Mr. Hatch. I'm on a deadline.
I kind of thought that you and Ray were maybe... - You thought wrong.
can I ask why?
no.
now, your only problem is, the man who you approached to get the job done is now working with Ray.
you understand there's a difference between wanting someone dead and doing something about it?
and here I thought you were the proactive, captain of industry type.
my mistake. I won't waste your time.
okay. Okay.
so let's say...
hypothetically, that I was remotely interested in this thing you're...
then let's say, hypothetically, you meet me here on Friday with $100, 000 cash.
and should I bring something else?
your appetite.
come in.
so it's not a problem?
for you, sweetie, nothing's a problem. - Good.
how are things with you and Ted? - I don't know.
maybe I should have tried it harder.
there's no rule that says you can't make up with your husband.
if you still love him.
Wow.
did Ray Elliott actually just use the 'L' word without smirking?
I'm just saying...
Oh my god. Ray's got a girlfriend.
to be honest with you, Dorothy, - I'm not sure what I've got. - Oh sure you do.
ray. - How's it going?
pretty much as expected.
let's get rolling.
alright ladies, it's on.
Yes, Mr Sykes. That's right.
ray would consider it a personal favor.
Wendell Hatch? - Yes
I'm Detective Sykes, this is Detective Holbrook.
we'd like you to come down to the station and answer a few questions.
how well do you know Ray Elliott?
he's involved in a missing person's case we're working.
he is? - What did he just say?
young lady named Heather Price.
we believe Mr. Elliott took her to a bed and breakfast last weekend.
she hasn't been heard from since.
Mr, Elliott took her to a bed and breakfast?
what do I always tell you about mumbling? No one can hear you.
seems like He's been spinning some tail to the Santa Barbara police department about how his credit card was stolen...
but we're pretty sure he killed her.
thank you.
you know anything about it.
why would you think that I would?
one of our officers saw you talking to Mr. Elliott
and he says there was an altercation at the bar.
I don't, I don't really know him. He, I think he works with my dad sometimes and I, I was in this bar and he was he was drunk, really drunk,
were there words exchanged?
words? - Yeah words.
you know those things you used to form sentences, only this time in a hostile context.
yeah there were words, but there were just...
hey you jerk...
you know so it wasn't anything but he did hit me out of nowhere, just swung at me.
we never talked about any missing...dead girl.
that's what your question was.
okay. Okay.
thanks for clearing that up, Mr. Hatch.
I hope you find this guy cause that's terrible.
hey you know what? We always get the bad guy.
as a matter of fact, the owner of the bed and breakfast coming in and take a look at some pictures.
have you been to this place? Shady Grove in Santa Barbara.
no I, I haven't been.
Hey! Hey!
it's just routine, Mr. Hatch.
we want to mix in some photos with Mr. Elliott's,
you know, give the guy some faces to choose from.
I mean, don't you have to ask my permission before you do that?
you don't mind, do you? - He's not going to pick you out, so - what's the harm? - No it's just...fuck.
detectives!
will you excuse us for a minute?
Ellroy Hotel.
sorry about that.
so what were you saying? - Nothing. I...just remembered. I have a thing...
thanks for coming in by the way. - Sure.
something like that?
I think you've earned yourself a store credit
it's Shady Grove - Matthew Klump please. -Speaking.
mr Klump. Congratulations. Today is your Lucky day.
you've just one a night of total luxury in beautiful Los Angeles.
all for being a loyal subscriber to B and B magazine, yes, we'd remove all the outstanding items from your bill plus we'll give you a small credit.
you got it.
and those would be red roses?
yes I'd like one dozen. - Okay, no problem.
right, so deliever the envelope to the front desk of Ellroy Hotel?
that's right.
adelle, these flowers are a pale comparison to you, love Bob.
who's Bob?
Bob's the man who make the mistake of sending my wife flowers.
don't let her out of your sight.
where you going?
dressing room.
unless you boys want me to strip right here?
was wondering when you'd show up.
Oh, Ray. I could just eat you up. - Hold that thought.
you like your gift certificate?
that was from you?
ray, you're gonna spoil me. - You know I think I am.
now can you come to the Ellroy Hotel at six-fifteen PM?
I've got us a room.
I'll have no miss choir practice.
I can write you a note?
okay, maybe I'm no Casanova.
and maybe I'm in way over my head.
but this was always Jack's job I was the pencil pusher. The statistical expert.
unfortunately, being able to tell you that seven and ten murders of crimes of passion or three and four hitmen are hired by one spouse to kill the other isn't terrily relevant information.
unless of course you are the one they are hired to kill.
Jack was right, I should never have gone straight.
I need a piece.
a piece of what?
you know a gun.
Oh why do you say that Snoop Dog?
let me show you what we've got.
ever get the feeling you're running out of leads?
this is Walsh. - I'm a happily married mother of two and this guy stand my fucking left breast...
think we might have something.
this guy I have watching Hannibal picked up something going down this afternoon at the Ellroy Hotel.
how good is your guy?
good enough to supply a room number. Worth a look, right?
great. Let's go.
ray. - Your boy's here.
any sign of Wendell?
are you sure this is gonna work out?
low ranks circus? Where did you get that clown from?
I'm off to church. - Shit.
ma'am, could you hang on for a minuite?
you clear it with the boss?
I go every Thursday, but you can check with the choir master if you want to.
we got that thing, anyway. Remember?
don't be late.
to new partners.
to the late, great Ray Elliott.
that is why, if we stay cool, things are going to be just...
what tells you to tell me stay cool. I am cool alright?
little piece of shit just arrived.
God Damn it. He's bailing. I told you he's gonna bail.
tell me what's happening.
he just left. Look we did it your way I'm gonna try my way. How about that?
we have to stay to the plan. Otherwise, people are going to get seriously hurt.
and Wendell will walk.
just get him in inside. - Yeah whatever.
I must get him killed.
hey Holmes!
park my car right there. - Thanks.
alright he's inside.
so I brought what you told me to bring.
I like a man who takes direction.
why don't we go up to your room and talk?
my grandfather's staying here.
and what's your grandfather's name?
Oh, Klump.
Yes, sir. He just checked in.
I will just... Thank you.
sir?
it's room 1015.
mr Klump? What are you doing here?
I won a contest.
welcome to the Ellroy Hotel. May I help you?
Yes. There should be an envelope for me.
my name's McGillicutty.
here you are.
mr Klump. This is very important.
exactly what kind of contest did you win?
a magazine kind?
drink? - Is that all you're offering?
let's get the business out of the way first.
you're sure you still want to get rid of Ray?
I'm not a man prone to second thought.
and you haven't found anyone else? - No.
good.
how do I know you're for real?
you'll never know for sure, but I promise you won't be dissapointed.
Adelle!
you son of a bitch!
take care and keep an eye on. - Sir!
whoever you are somebody really want you dead.
now I don't know about you, Bobby, but I'm feeling pretty dirty.
can't I watch?
ray? - Hey. Was starting to worry about you. Where you been?
just covering our accounts, as instructed.
so I think I need to tell you something. I'm actually a huge opera fan.
that's what you needed to tell me?
but I always preferred Carmen to Salome. You know why?
because in Salome the hero loses his head and in Carmen the evil temptress is made to pay with her life?
Oh no. Actually, it's the overture.
hey Lola, Are you okay?
yeah I'm ready.
God Damn!
excuse me sir.
ice for Champagne? - Oh forget the ice.
why don't you get in the tub with me?
I know these things that we can do with the water jets - I tell you what... - Trust me when I'm done with you
you're going to need ice.
can I help you?
I'm looking for Ray I mean Bob.
he's a guest here.
are you Adelle? - Yes.
room 1215.
thank you.
I've learned not to rely on a single person in this world.
and I'm not.
I'm relying on a dozen.
mostly cheats, killers and cons.
and I happen to trust these people.
or at least trust on their baser instincts.
let's hope they don't disappoint me.
nice shoes.
thank you.
Oh fuck!
I got a paper cut.
boss, you better down.
but the most important thing I learned from Jack, within the face of real danger, make certain that you are never ever around
I don't like this.
mr Klump I think we need to get you out of here.
hell no!
this is Detective Walsh. Officer needs assistance, we're at the Ellroy Hotel, room 1015.
I swear it was her.
I'm gonna kill him.
then I'll pray for God to resurrect him so I can kill him again.
ray. Where are you?
ray?
front desk. - You have a Robert in the hotel?
I'm sorry? - A Robert. A Bob...
what's the last name?
I don't know Just tell me.
if there are any Roberts or God damned Bobs in the hotel or I will come down there and personally shove that phone...
I have a first initial 'R'
yeah? - R. Elliott. Room 1215.
sir? Hello? Hello?
So...you never thought it would come down to this.
you try to cover all the basis do your homework.
at the end of the day
it's the people you trust.
I'm not a huge proponent of that word.
I prefer leverage to human nature any day.
sometimes, you just have to roll the dice...
come on in, the water's fine.
I ask you a question. - Shoot.
making a speech.
you almost done?
room service!
it's open.
Oh my god.
you friend of Lola's?
Oh shit.
listen. Please. I swear to God I've never seen this woman before in my life.
my name is Robert Hatch...
Bob Hatch? - If you prefer.
you see any flowers for my wife down there.
what's going on here?
to be honest, I'm not quite sure.
Hey. That's him. That's the guy you were asking about.
I've never seen this old guy before in my life.
he's lying! - What are you doing in his room with a gun?
hey boss! - What?
it's six thirteen.
God bless it. Give me the envelope.
don't kill him until I get back.
suppose we will...
contest will be just fine...
step back into your suite.
come on.
I don't know you but you don't look that stupid.
house keeping.
Hello?
this is dispatch, I need two uniforms to room fifteen-seventeen.
maid reports an immobile Caucasian male. Possible shooting victim.
Roger that.
victim with several gun shot wounds to the chest
Roger.
we have a positive ID on the shooting victim.
victim identified as Jack McCadden.
Lola! - Here, it's yours.
Lola!
what the hell was wrong with the other fifteen bodies that I showed you?
I just wanted to make sure it was a good match.
you just couldn't stand the idea of You not leaving a good looking corpse.
Vatiny's gonna be the death of you, Ray.
let's hope.
that should cover the cops and any incidentals?
and then some.
hey Cam! Put him somewhere nice.
it's not every day you get to bury yourself.
what are you gonna do with the money?
assuming the Sultan actually pays what he says?
I don't know. Five million's a lot of cash, but I am a river to my people.
enough warmed over Lawrence of Arabia, Sudhir.
you're from the Boston.
where I have people.
goodbye, Jack McCadden.
may I rest in peace?
here's a new spin.
if one in four men cheats on their wives
then three in four are faithful
and even more admirable nine in ten women.
not bad odds to play.
so no more Jack no more Alibis, no more worries.
just the thought of waking up every morning and hearing...
you are such an asshole.
sometimes it helps if you don't know the whole story.
in business. Not relationships.
I want you to be part of my new life, not my old one.
so where should we go?
it's up to you.
you said you've already been to the Holy land
I also mentioned not everyone is working an angle.
noted.
I think we should try the full discloser thing, see how it goes.
I'm not sure about Asia. How's London.
not a good idea, at the moment.
Caribbean? - Some minor, unfinished litigation.
Paris? - Yes. Actually no.
Amsterdam? Greenland? - Come here.
I just realized you are quite a bit taller than me.

it WAS ONCE A CENTER OF MAJOR TRADE AND ALONG ITS COAST, THIS FORT.
this WAS THE SIXTH PIT STOP IN A RACE AROUND THE WORLD.
teams ARIVED HERE AT THE END OF THE LAST LEG FOR A MANDATORY REST PERIOD.

however, THEY'RE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO USE THESE TICKETS.
>> WE'RE GOING TO POLAND.

I THINK WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND A BETTER FLIGHT THAN THIS, CHARLA.
do YOU WANT TO WAIT FOR DANNY AND OSWALD AND SHARE A TAXI?

>> JUST BEING THERE ON THOSE TRACKS, YOUR IMAGINATION JUST ROLLS, YOU CAN SEE THE TRAINS COMING IN AND STOPPING AND PEOPLE BEING UNLOADED LIKE CATTLE AS THEY'RE PULLED FROM EACH OTHER.
that's THE LAST TIME A LOT OF THEM SAW EACH OTHER.
>> WHAT CAME TO MIND WAS ALL THE BOOKS THAT NEVER GOT WERE NEVER TRIED, ALL THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT NEVER GOT TO GROW.
generations WERE MURDERED.

you CAN'T FORGET THAT.
God FORBID IT SHOULD EVER
happen AGAIN.
>> THERE'S TAXIS OVER HERE.
>> THANK YOU.
>> MOMENTS LIKE THIS, MAKES YOU THINK ABILITY THINGS THAT ARE FAR MORE IMPORTANT.
>> YEAH, RESPECT OF HUMANKIND.
>> IT WAS INCREDIBLY EMOTIONAL.
I GREW UP IN A COMMUNIST COUNTRY WHERE WE WERE COMPLETELY DEPRIVED OF ANY FREEDOM, KIND OF REMIND YOU OF WHERE I COULD HAVE ENDED UP LIVING FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE
and IT MAKES ME VERY GRATEFUL
to BE LIVING IN A PLACE WHERE I
don't HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
expressing WHO I AM AS A PERSON.
it's JUST SAD.
>> IT'S ALL RIGHT.

the FIREGUARD TOWER OF ST.MARY'S CHURCH AND THE TOWN HALL TOWER.
as THEY CLIMB THEY MUST COUNT THE STAIRS AND CALCULATE THE NUMBER OF STEPS IN BOTH TOWERS.
once THEY HAVE THIS NUMBER,
they MUST PRESENT IT TO THE GUARD.
if THEY'VE CALCULATED THE
correct ANSWER, GUARD WILL HAND
them THE FAST FORWARD AWARD.

>> OK.
>> THE TWO TOWERS YOU MUST CLIMB ARE FIRE FORWARD TOWER OF ST. MARY'S CHURCH AND TOWN HALL TOWERS.

>> THIS IS IT.
>> LOOK AT THOSE STAIRS.
let's SEE HOW FAR UP WE HAVE TO GO.
>> DO YOU THINK THEY TOOK THE FAST FORWARD?
>> I'M SURER THEY DID.
it's JUST ADDING NUMBERS.
>> ONCE WE REACHED THE TOP OF ST. MARY'S CHURCH, WE HAD TO ADD THE TOTAL NUMBER OF STEPS.
we ALL ARRIVED AT THE SAME NUMBER AT THE TOWN HALL TOWER, 111 STEPS.
at THE SECOND TOWER, WE HAD DIFFERENT NUMBERS.
>> I FELT CONFIDENT IN MY NUMBER.

we're READY TO GO.
>> OVER ONE MILLION PEOPLE WERE EXTERMINATED AT AUSCHWITZ.
observe A MOMENT OF SILENCE BEFORE GETTING YOUR NEXT CLUE.
>> BOTH JOE AND I HAD SEEN IMAGES IN PHOTOGRAPHS AND MOVIES, BUT THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN DESCRIBE THE SILENCE AND THE EMOTION, RAW, GUT-WREMBLINGING EMOTION THAT YOU FEEL WHEN YOU STEP OUT INTO THAT AREA.
I FELT THE WEIGHT OF ALL THOSE SOULS.
it's JUST UNTHINKABLE WHAT THOSE PEOPLE HAD TO GO THROUGH.
>> TO GO TO AUSCHWITZ PUTS
things IN PERSPECTIVE.
all THOSE DUMB FIGHTS WE HAVE THE BICKERING THINGS THAT TURN INTO NONSENSE, IT'S STUFF THAT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER.
>> I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT PEOPLE MUST HAVE EXPERIENCED IN THIS HORRIBLE PLACE.

our GREAT GRANDFATHER'S WHOLE FAMILY WAS KILLED.
it's SO PERSONAL TO US.

>> WHAT REALLY AFFECTED ME IS
that JOE AND I WERE BORN IN A
time WHERE WE CAN BE OURSELVES.
but THERE WERE PEOPLE LIKE JOE AND I THAT WEREN'T ALLOWED TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES AS WE ARE NOW.
>> YEAH.
>> IT'S UNBELIEVABLE HOW ONE

Phil KEOGHAN: I'm standing high above the center of New York City
for generations, the crossroads of the world.
a world that will soon play host to 22 people who have decided to take a break from their everyday lives, and embark on a race around the world
the contestants will be racing without the benefit of personal computers or cell phones.
they've been stripped of all money, credit cards and maps.
their greatest resource will be each other as they circle the globe in teams of two.
the 11 teams are:
Frank and Margarita, married with a baby daughter, but now separated and hoping to reconcile.
frank: It's pretty much the crossroads of our relationship.
MARGARITA: We haven't been living together for the past ten months, and I think it's going to be important for us to really connect.
KEOGHAN: Paul and Amie, recently engaged.
they've just started living together.
AMIE: I think this race could have a huge impact on our relationship.
paul: It's either going to make us so much stronger than we already are, or we're going to come back on separate planes.
KEOGHAN: Kim and Leslie, both teachers and single.
LESLIE: The both of us are mentally prepared to handle um, anything that comes along.
kim: I'm just from a small town in Texas.
what concerns me the most is dying.
KEOGHAN: Lenny and Karyn, dating and thinking of marriage.
Lenny: I would like the money to buy the ring that I think she deserves.
KARYN: He knows I'm a very difficult person.
I'm very competitive, very aggressive.
he deals with me like that on a regular basis.
KEOGHAN: Dave and Margaretta, grandparents who have been married 40 years.
MARGARETTA: He tends to be a little bossy, and it's not in my nature to take orders very well.
my wife is an amazing lady.
she can do anything that she sets her mind to.
KEOGHAN: Matt and Ana.
they met and married while serving in the army.
ANA: You know, I come from strong-minded women in my family, so I'm high-strung and bossy, but Matthew likes that.
Matt: She's really smart.
she's got a good head on her shoulders.
she never trusts my instincts.
KEOGHAN: Joe and Bill, life partners, together 14 years.
bill: Our name is Team Guido, and Guido is our dog.
you don't have to be the strongest person, you don't have to be the fastest one, but you do have to be the smartest ones.
KEOGHAN: Patricia and Brenda, working moms in search of a once- in-a-lifetime adventure.
BRENDA: I hope that we represent the women out there who love their families and love their husbands, but don't mind being themselves.
I don't think either one of our husbands were real crazy about the idea to go traipsing around the world, but, uh, we just made a pact, and we decided we were just going to make sure we did it.
KEOGHAN: Robert and Brennan, best friends and attorneys at the same firm.
Robert: We've both kind of been silver-spooned in our lives, you know, grew up with good educations and a good job, but that doesn't really matter when you find yourself hungry in the streets of Bangladesh.
KEOGHAN: Nancy and Emily, conservative mother, adventurous daughter.
Emily: We're a lot different.
I'm a get up and go kind of, on-the-spot, fly-by-the-seat-of-my-pants kind of girl.
sometimes she doesn't look before she leaps, and I think she might get us in a situation that I'm not quite ready for.
KEOGHAN: Drew and Kevin, fraternity brothers and best friends for 17 years.
drew: Kevin and I have done zero for preparation.
KEVIN: Oh, we are the ugly Americans, there's no question about it.
there's definitely a potential for an international incident.
KEOGHAN: Can these couples withstand the stress of traveling together across almost 35, 000 miles?
who will muster the right combination of brains, brawn and teamwork to win the $1 million?
these are the questions weighing most heavily as we get ready to begin
the Amazing Race.
well, in just a few minutes, you'll be leaving on a race that'll circle the globe.
along the way, you'll be required to complete a number of tasks.
now some of these will be physically challenging.
others will challenge your mind.
now listen carefully.
there are eight elimination points in this race.
the first one is going to be happening very soon.
now once you start, you need to complete your tests as fast as you can, because the last team to get to the elimination point will be out of the race.
does everybody understand that?
okay. This is a travel packet.
now inside is all the information you need to get going along with some cash.
how you use the money is completely up to you.
but remember, you won't be getting any more of it until you finish this leg of the race, so if I can give you any advice, make sure you spend it wisely.
now, your travel packets are attached to the luggage you brought with you, which is at the top of these stairs.
when I give you the word, you can go up there, open up your packets, and what you do after that is completely up to you.
all right, everyone, the world is waiting for you.
I want to wish all of you the best of luck.
travel safe.
go!
here.
here. Here, here.
okay. - Come on "Get yourself to Johannesburg..."
...South Africa.
johannesburg, South Africa.
my God.
Oh, my God.
you may only travel on one of these three flights.
Alitalia Number 605.
Swissair, 101.
south African Air Number 202.
hurry, hurry.
seats are first come, first serve.
seats are first come, first serve. - Let's go.
KEOGHAN: It's the most daring competition ever attempted.
11 two-person teams, bound by friendship, love, or family, will race around the world.
they have no idea where they're going, what dangers they may encounter, or how the journey will affect their lives.
most of the teams will be eliminated, but the team that reaches the finish line first will win a cash prize of $1 million.
this is a race like no other in history.
this is The Amazing Race.
move this way.
let's go right down the middle of the park
come on, baby.
come on. - I'm coming.
we've got to figure out...
okay. - ...which airport to go to.
what's the first thing we're going to do when we get out of here?
all right, what we need to do is find a phone.
it's probably JFK or LaGuardia.
Yeah, it's certainly not LaGuardia. - No.
there's an outside chance it could always be Newark Airport, but I don't think it'd be Newark.
...no, it's JFK. - Yeah.
find a subway.
go straight ahead over there.
come on, come on. - Find a subway, and then find a phone there.
I'll hold the money.
what are you holding the money for?
I'm holding the money. - Don't be stupid.
$90?
what are we going to do with $90?
I don't even know if I can read it. - Oh, man.
I feel terribly slow.
I really feel slow.
okay. - Let's get out of here.
well, we're... we're not that far from Times Square
is this one?
JFK.
Hey, there's a taxi right down there.
please, please? Yeah.
not the...
right here? - Whoo, whoo! All right, whoa, whoa.
they're probably all going out of JFK.
don't you think? - Yeah...
we're going to wait on hold for Alitalia.
that's forever, we're not going to get through.
can you just call, please? - I'll try South Africa.
I'd rather spend less money and take, like, a train or something, and get there and be there for the 6: 25 one, no?
and what if everyone takes an earlier flight, and we're the last ones?
so we save more money.
we get eliminated, you're last.
here comes one on this side.
Ah, New York taxicabs.
they're all full.
it's right here under the sign
Yeah, yeah, come on, come on, come on.
get a pen out, Kev. Kev, I need a pen.
you got to hit six numbers to get a live human being on the phone.
it's amazing that you even got up this morning and tied your shoes.
Oh, shut up.
three phone calls already. - Shut up.
three phone calls, and we got nothing.
I'm trying to get to JFK airport.
I know, I think it's the A train, right?
Yeah, the A from Times Square.
ready? - Put it in here?
you put it in and push through.
Oh!
a simple task.
this one, or the South African flight.
just go to JFK anyway?
and just-just hope that we can get on.
but I just don't want to be the last one there so we'll get booted off.
Yeah, I don't want to be at the wrong airport.
well, then you find...
you find the number for Swissair and call it.
no, we'll call a cab.
...this is fine.
okay. We'll be fine.
all right. Won't we?
NANCY: I don't know many mothers and daughters who...
who would have even considered taking on a challenge like this.
do you know what airlines?
Jesus.
I can barely hear.
you want to hear? You-You want to try?
just ask her where it's leaving from.
honey, there's no names.
it's just seats.
there's just seats available, reserved.
Aah. The reserved...
JFK. - JFK. Let's go.
JFK, 5: 55.
you know, Frank and I have been separated for close to a year.
once we decided to do this, we thought it would be a good chance to, you know, really see if we can work together.
frank: Because, you know, she has it her way or the highway, or it's my way or the highway, and we... we never get past that point.
Oh, come on!
frank: All right, a little... a little quiz.
who's the boss?
little quiz.
pop quiz.
you aren't supposed to start that.
pop quiz, pop quiz. Who's the boss?
well, that would be you, honey.
there you go, all right!
you got the right answer.
let's go to Swissair.
south African is more likely to go direct.
Oh. Good point - Versus Swiss Air is going to Switzerland, - like Zurich first. - Oh, good point.
and then... So we should go South African.
good point. Oh, you're right.
well, let's go to South Africa, - not Swissair. - Yeah, South African Airways, please.
Matt: I just don't want to be the first ones eliminated.
that would really suck.
you know what I'm saying.
ANA: I doubt we will be.
Hey, what about the attitude...? - We're gonna win.
what are you talking about?
ANA: He's the perfect partner.
he's always, you know, upbeat, and he's a lot of fun to be with, and that's something that... that's good for a lifetime.
you sure we're going the right way? - Nope.
thank you. - Thank you very much.
Grazi. - We'll see you.
south African! I see it!
Yes, Leon, yes!
leon, you just might be our ticke t out of the ghetto.
this better be right.
maybe we should've stayed on there.
we should've took a cab.
paul: We both have, you know, short fuses, and we're both stubborn.
I'm sure we're going to get into it before this is over.
south African. It's right there.
right there. South African, right here.
we got economy. - Okay.
okay. They're not even open yet. - Yes.
I'm so glad we're first.
that's 40, and there's... there should be two dollars... two-two dollars in change.
I'm sorry. We can't tip. It's just...
how much you want?
just give us the... all the change back, please.
my name is Joe.
margarita. - Margarita, nice to meet you.
Frank. - Frank, nice to meet you, Frank.
we made it second, uh...
I totally expected to be first.
I was just so pissed. I couldn't believe it.
they were just standing there with that stupid grin on his face.
I'm so glad we're here.
I mean, wack, I mean, come on, man-- look at those goofed-out hats they're wearing.
their stupid identical clothing.
I mean, come on. "Let's look like twins."
shut up!
Alitalia is here?
no, he said Swissair. Is there Alitalia?
do you want to go there?
well...
I thought you wanted Swissair.
well, apparently five other teams got on the other flights.
that's good.
no, it's not-- they're going to get there before us.
Yeah, but they probably took a cab and spent 60 bucks.
we spent three dollars.
I know. I just want to get there first.
man: This is the Kennedy Airport.
I think the competition is strong through and through.
we're out with the lead pack, and that's a good thing right now.
um, it's so early. Who knows what it means?
but it's dangerous at first, because everybody does start off together, and you want to distance yourself a little bit.
you don't want to get eliminated early and let it sort itself out later.
LESLIE: I can't imagine how five people made it to the airport to the South African flight before we did.
MARGARETTA: I am just delighted that we are right in the middle of the pack, which, for me, is fine.
Emily: The last four teams, um
we're all kind of stuck together.
NANCY: One of the four of us will probably be the first team eliminated, 'cause we're the last ones leaving.
KEOGHAN: The 11 teams are now approaching
johannesburg, South Africa, and they have no idea what's in store for them.
flags mark points along the race course where the teams will find route information
the clues that tell them where to go next.
MARGARITA: Every little step counts.
you could be the first person on the airplane, in the first row, and that makes a difference as to how quickly you get out of the airport.
Yes!
all right, head to Ryan...
seats are still first come, first serve.
this way. Gilbert!
okay, Lanseria Airport.
all right, let's get in.
Lanseria Airport.
go, go, go, go. Let's go, let's go.
part of the game right now is getting to another airport for another connecting flight.
you have to drive fast.
you have to beat all these people.
who is it-- let's see who it is.
I think it's the lawyers.
Yeah, it's the lawyers. Ha!
come on, punch it, Carl, punch it!
let's go, Carl, let's go, let's go!
Ah! - Yeah! Yeah! Ye
well, I don't know.
no sense in stewing over it now.
well, there's nothing we can do.
I'm not going to slit my throat, but I can be pissed about it.
Oh, yeah, but there's nothing we can do now.
all we can do is sit here, so...
I told you, anything but first is a... is a loss.
let's go!
come on! - I'm coming
move it!
all right. You guys are on th e first flight out.
okay. - I can't tell you where you're going to go, though.
margarita and Frank, you guys are on the first flight out.
that is amazing! - All right - Congratulations. - Good job.
I cannot believe this.
I can't believe this.
I hate this crap!
that doesn't sound good.
Oops, sorry, Margarita, are you okay? - It's okay.
I have very, very high expectations...of myself.
we're still on the first plane.
what's wrong with you?
team Guido, number one again!
right! We're in for the night.
I know we're going on a-a small aircraft for the first three teams.
frank: They're going to drop us off, and I can imagine some, like, real remote area.
who knows what's to come?
KEOGHAN: The teams will eventually have to get here
Songwe Village, a pit stop along the race course.
teams are required to check into these pit stops and then wait 12 hours before continuing on.
when the 12 hours are up, the teams will leave in the same order in which they arrived.
most importantly, the last team to arrive here today will be eliminated.
at the Livingston Airport, the teams will find a fleet of cars and their next piece of route information.
they can drive themselves or hire a driver, but drivers cannot provide directions, so all teams will have to figure out for themselves where they have to go.
go, baby. We got 'em.
passport.
Hi.
I'm Rob. Nice to meet you. You go.
hurry up!
keep an eye out for the smoke that thunders and walk the knife edge.
that's it, let's go.
if you want to drive, that's fine.
it's $50. I charge $50.
I'll drive.
yo, yo, everybody, we're going to that big white smoke, the smoke that thunders.
you drive. - Come on, come on, you drive.
come on, fast, fast, fast.
go, go, go fast. We've got to beat all these people.
watch out.
Yes! All right!
team Guido!
KEOGHAN: Teams have to get here, Victoria Falls, where they'll find their next route marker on an overlook called the Knife's Edge.
we go straight, go straight, go to an open clearing, okay?
I can't wait. - they're coming.
MARGARETTA: Come on, let's hustle.
hang on.
Oh, yeah! - I'm telling you, us four
we're catching up to the other crew, I'm telling you.
which way do we go?
Kevin and Drew?
keep an eye out for the smoke "that thunders," then walk the knife edge.
I don't know where we're going.
no, we drive the car.
drew: Kev, I'm driving!
let's go, let's go. - I'll drive. I'll drive.
go, go, just go.
NANCY: I'm obviously not the youngest one here.
you know, I can't run as fast as these kids.
mom, hurry.
Emily... - She's kind of a planner.
she likes everything laid out, so unfortunately,
I think that's kind of hindering us right now.
you know, the lady in the bathroom, see, Emily, was trying to give me directions.
we don't have time, Mom. - Emily...
I know what it is. It's Victoria Falls.
the smoke that thunders.
water thunders down; it makes the smoke.
go to an open clearing where there's no trees.
Oh, my God, there it is.
the smoke that thunders.
can you tell me which way we are going?
Emily: We don't know.
it's all right, keep going straight.
just go as fast as you can.
why don't we ask someone?
we need to pass 'em.
they don't know where they're going. - King of the road!
drew: Don't let them go around us.
they're catching up. - They are?
go, go, go, go.
those guys are fighting it out for second place back there.
are they?
Oh, this ain't child's play.
damn.
but if he tries to move into the middle of the road...
look, he's not going to let us pass him.
go, Maxwell, go, go around him.
what the hell is he doing?
he's forcing everybody off the road.
nice job, Maxwell. Beautiful job.
go. Just follow him.
go around them, babe.
come on, dude, you were this close. - Sorry.
it's a race, and the race goes on.
keep moving, kid. Come on, you've got it now,
go, go, go. I'm not going to. We-we're flooring it.
let's go over this again.
you give directions, and I drive.
go, go, go, go. - Good man.
Yeah, there you go, fast, fast, fast, fast!
AMIE: Whoa... Fast, fast!
victoria Falls.
man, here's all the other trucks right here.
Where's Knife's Edge?
the Knife's Edge?
it's this way, come on.
come on, guys, come on.
I need to go to the Knife's Edge.
this side. - A: Which way?
to the Knife's Edge.
which way? Straight down here?
all right, which way?
straight?
Davy? - Huh?
the footpath goes this way and this way.
whoa, man!
this is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
go, Em, go. It's not far.
Emily: Mom, this way!
Hurry!
get it "More water flows over Victoria Falls "than any other waterf all in the world, "so get yourself to dry land at Abseil Zambia top of Batoka Gorge.
...to get yourself to drier land at Abseil Zambizia top of Batoka Gorge.
...At Abseil Zambia, - top of Batoka George." - Take this back to the car, right?
wait, wait, wait, we're going to follow him.
the worst about it was runni ng on this "knife's edge" thing, in the rain, with backpacks on trying desperately to stay ahead of Frank
drew, come on!
wait, we can't leave without this. - What?
Oh, yeah, here's for the book.
drew, stop taking out money every time these guys...
you just said to me, "Get the book."
I thought it was free, and he was giving it to you.
man, nothing's free, Kevin, we're in Africa!
you go to Statue of Liberty, is the guy giving these things away for free?
well, it's got a map in it though, here.
zambia, that's where we are.
that's Namibia...jackass.
KEOGHAN: Right now, any team can win the right to skip all tasks left in this leg of the race.
to win this right, they have to search for the fast forward pass.
fast forward. - Huh?
a fast forward. I'll be dipped. - Okay.
the clue inside this envelope will lead the teams to the fast forward hidden at the bottom of the canyon, to a place called "The Boiling Pot."
boil, Boil Pot
Boil's pot. You know Boil's Pot?
KEOGHAN: Now, there's only one fast forward pass hidden on each leg of the race, so the first team there gets it.
any other teams searching are just wasting time.
Wher-Where is the Pot Boil or the Boiling Pot?
will you take us there? Will you take us there?
as fast as you can.
boiling Pot. Oh, God.
how far is that, David?
679 yards. It's less than a half a mile.
all right, he said go. Here we go.
Oh, lovely.
there it is!
first one!
hell, yeah "Go directly to the next pit stop."
Songwe Village.
hell, yeah!
this is the hardest thing I've ever done.
I'll be all right, but I don't think anybody else could have done that.
Davy? - What?
there's the flag.
over there? - Yes.
some other people went and got it.
we got to go back the same damn way.
I don't know whether I can.
I'm going so much,
I haven't taken time to be smart.
and so, hopefully the two of us will smarten each other up and slow ourselves down a little bit.
DAVE: The only thing I'm sort of feeling right now is kind of dumb.
here you go.
thank you.
here's some money.
thank you.
here you are. Have a good day.
we're playing a game, but we're also sort of impromptu diplomats for our country and we want to behave as best we can.
I mean, we're guests in other people's countries and it's just the way of showing our appreciation for them letting us be here, and the kids like it, so it's really a cool thing to do.
KEOGHAN: With the fast forward, Rob and Brennan are in the lead.
not far behind are Bill and Joe,
Frank and Margarita and Lenny and Karyn.
in the middle of the pack, Pat and Brenda,
kim and Leslie and Dave and Margaretta.
trailing teams are Nancy and Emily,
Matt and Ana, Paul and Amie and Drew and Kevin.
if you can please help us.
we need to find Batoka Gorge.
if you will, please?
where there's a big tree.
to the left?
to the left, yes.
okay, so off the main road...
thank you so much, folks.
I'm sorry to interrupt.
drew, come on, get in the car.
get in the car!
he told me the same thing.
Kev, you've got to be cordial and nice to these people.
you can't be yelling at me to get in the car when I'm trying to be nice to them.
you have to get out of the car and you have to approach people in an affable, friendly way.
you don't do it like you're in New York.
don't listen to him. Don't listen to a word he says.
you're an idiot!
don't listen to a word he's saying.
he said go to the main road, make a right and then there's going to be a big tree.
under the big tree.
those are the directions you got.
it's under the big tree.
now, Kev, you don't ask from the car.
have to get out. - Drew, shut up.
and "sir, please, thank you." - Shut up.
Hi, my friend, how are you?
good, thanks.
can you tell me where Batoka Gorge is?
Hi, how are you, my friend?
very well, thank you.
we're lost. We need a little bit of help.
okay, Abseil Zambia is to the left. - Okay.
Yep, gorge, make a left.
left. - Yep.
KEOGHAN: The next route marker sits 300 feet beneath the rim of Batoka Gorge.
getting to it is the challenge.
it's a detour.
to travel by air, take a quick ride along the zip line.
Oh, my God!
Yeah, go Team Guido!
all right! - Oh, God.
then a fast swing down to the bottom of the gorge.
step off!
christ almighty.
to travel by land, take a long walk down the trail to the bottom of the gorge.
I don't know if I can bungee jump.
you're going to bungee jump.
Oh, trust me, you're going to bungee jump.
yo, I can't bungee jump.
Oh, are you going to bungee jump your ass off right now, girl.
Oh, boy, are you going to bungee jump right now.
let's go.
come on. This is nothing.
let's go. This is humorous. This is a joke.
come on, our little girl would have done it in a minute, sissy.
we have a little baby girl, she's 16 months old, and at the very least we need to have a working relationship to bring her up in a loving environment.
just drive.
well, I don't even know where I'm going.
just call it. You want to go down there, I'll go there. - I don't know, Paul. Just go over that way.
call it, though. You want to go there? - I don't know!
you make a decision.
I know you're right about everything, what can I say?
there's a fricking sign right there.
why didn't we take this?
what does it say? - Oh, my God, I'm going to kill you.
I said go back and we'll find out that road.
so you're going to sit there and cry?
you know, we're done.
who loves you, baby?
come on!
it's simple! Come on!
here she comes
let's go, let's go, let's go
come on.
come on.
are you ready?
Yeah, baby!
step off!
I'll make it.
it's all part of the race, right?
I'm not going to walk.
are you ready?
all right, Margarita? - Yeah.
okay, Margarita. - Wait, wait.
you can do it, baby!
you can do it. You can do this.
just do a small step, that's all, don't do a big leap.
come on, baby, you can do it!
just step off.
I'm very proud of you.
you did a... damn great job.
come on, give me a hug , girl, give me a hug.
don't knock me off the cliff now.
I made it down this far.
all right, baby, good job. Good job.
that was a good job.
good job, good job.
see, I'm holding up, baby.
you're holding up. You're holding up.
good work. Now drive yourself to Songwe Village.
warning: the last team to check in will be out of the race.
that won't be us, that's for sure.
KEOGHAN: Since Rob and Brennan found the fast forward pass, they were able to skip the zip-line detour and come directly to Songwe village.
welcome to Songwe.
thank you very much. - Congratulations.
you've come in the first position.
thank you very much.
leg one, baby, out in front
we're out in the lead right now and the rest of the pack is nipping at our heels.
let's go, baby.
I'm scared to death, but I'm gonna do it.
I'm scared, I'm very scared.
piece of cake! Don't look down!
man: Are you ready?
Yes, I am.
three, two, one, step off.
Oh, I was so afraid on that swinging thing.
are you ready? - Yes.
let's do it right this time. That's air.
piece of cake.
piece of cake here.
all right, babe.
looking good, baby!
that's one heck of a woman over there.
that was way cool.
got your straps?
we've got you under control.
are you ready? - Hell, yeah.
Oh, my God.
okay, but I'm worried about that whole holding up the thing.
just not good at holding things up.
it's out of proportion.
I can't hold on to this and do everything I need to do.
we're in, what? Seventh place?
I don't know. I can't do math right now.
and we've got to get to Songwe Village.
okay. God there are a lot of bugs out in the jungle-- go figure.
ANA: Get yourself to drier land at Abseil, Zambia, top of Batoka George.
Batoka George.
top of Batoka George.
it's got to be a mountain.
abseil Zambia is what we got to be asking for.
is this Batoka Gorge? - No.
let's ask these people.
Batoka Gorge?
she doesn't know, Paul. She doesn't know.
how do you not know? You live here.
how do you not know?
easy Amie. She don't know.
Batoka George.
he doesn't know. I'm not even gonna stop.
Batoka George. Batoka George...
Batoka George?
Batoka Gorge.
uh, let me find out.
Batoka... Batoka Gorge?
do you know where Batoka Gorge is?
Batoka Gorge? - Batoka Gorge?
I mean, locals might know certain words, like "Gorge," you know, but I mean, they didn't know nothing.
do I stay on this road all the way down? - Yeah.
all the way down.
all the way down. Yeah, yeah.
is it by the big waterfall?
Yeah, ask there, they will tell you where the Batoka Gorge is.
is that? That is Batoka Gorge? - Yeah.
how can you live somewhere - and not know where the hell anything is? - I don't know.
you know what I'm saying?
Hello? Like, what planet are you on, you know?
village idiot- - that's us.
hurry, hurry, hurry.
has anyone died doing this?
has anyone died recently?
I was just selfishly praying that God wouldn't eliminate us so I could experience as much as possible, and look what happened.
things happen for a reason.
Oh, my God
Oh, my God.
I don't know where I'm going, babe. - Right back there.
are you ready?
and I just hold on?
you need to go across that?
Oh, yeah, we're going air.
get the hell out of here.
come on, I want to do it.
I want to do it.
come on. It's the fastest way. You want to walk?
I'm going to h ave a heart attack going across that thing.
and what's thi...?
make a choice.
on three-- two, one, let's go.
you're going to make us last;let's go.
all right! - Make a choice.
forget it, I made a choice.
we're doing it.
the choice is made for you.
sorry, kiddo.
you lose.
Emily: Is that Amie and Paul?
Yeah. We're ahead of them, can you believe it?
I don't know. - And Paul doesn't want to do it.
we're in last place, anyway.
why don't we just quit now?
do you know we drove in the middle of nowhere 'cause he wouldn't listen to me?
Oh, my God, I don't know if I can do this.
come on, this is the most exciting thing you've ever done in your life.
it'll be the time of your life.
it'll be the best thing you've ever done.
three, two, one...
Oh, God!
go, baby, go!
am I next?
are you okay, mate?
I'm sorry, I'm a big puss.
come on, guys, get it together.
I'm kind of in a hurry here.
I'm, like, deathly afraid of heights.
that was the warm-up, mate.
now for the real thing.
you kidding me? - No
what's the real thing?
are you ready?
Yes. - Step.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Instructor: Okay, Emily, well done!
I am scared to death.
like that guy behind me is.
he's gonna be worse than me.
Instructor: And three, two, one! Step off!
Emily: Yeah, Mom!
are you kidding me? I can't do that.
okay, so we turn around, make a left?
right where we came?
make a right, where there's houses?
you guys, Songwe Village is right there.
I think that's what we passed.
stop this car. - Whoa, whoa, whoa!
three, two, one, let's go.
Oh, this is nothing! Who you kidding!
baby, we can do it.
we can do it, baby .
I think I'm keeping my eyes closed.
I'll come up here with you, babe.
Oh, Jesus! - It's okay, baby,
you can do it, honey.
Emily's mom did it. Nancy did it.
I don't care if the pope did this.
let's go.
come on.
push?
Oh, God.
don't look down, don't look down.
I look like a big puss.
AMIE: Come on, babe, you can do it.
come on, Paul, get it over and done with .
it's gonna happen.
let's get it done.
are you ready? - No!
are you ready?! - Come on, Paul.
okay, let's go
in three, two.
Paul, are you all right?
I love you, baby!
Matt: You can do it, honey. I love you.
Yay! We're not last!
Paul! - What?
we're not in last! Look!
way to go, honey, way to go.
Yay! We're not last!
step, Ana, step. Step!
she's so scared of heights, man, so scared.
I'm just mad now.
it wasn't fun, that's for sure.
I'm shaking.
Matt: I mean, that meant a lot to me.
Whoa! - Good one.
these flies are like...
like lobsters here.
Oh! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, Kev!
swing, you fat bastard! Swing!
there you go. Step to.
now you're moving.
I'm done. Where's the car?
right there. You see it?
jump on.
Oh, thank you.
keep going. Oh, this driver sucks.
we're in Africa-- let's hit the road, baby.
come on. - Come on!
I like them. They're nice.
Oh, they are precious.
drive! Faster!
this guy's got nothing here
why you going this way?
Songwe is on the right.
Songwe Gorge is this way.
the moron is back.
once a moron always a moron, right, honey?
Yeah, baby, I'm a moron.
but you know what?
you fell in love with this moron.
Songwe Village, turn left.
turn left.
Oh. Oh, Point. Songwe Point Village.
Uh-oh.
U-turn. M-Maxwell, U-turn, U-turn.
wait, Kev.
Songwe. Songwe Village
go straight. Go this way, go that way. Maxwell. Wait, wait, wait.
Songwe Village. - Maxwell, just go, just go.
wait! Wait - Come on! Go!
do you see this?!
we're out!
team Guido reporting for duty. - Team Guido is here.
it takes two!
all right!
thank you! - You've come into the second position.
both: Thank you very much.
welcome to Songwe. Congratulations.
you are number three. - Thank you very much.
it's been a wonderful experience.
what's gonna happen to the relationship?
it seems like, wow, this is gonna work out, it's great.
and then three hours later, you know, something else happens, and then we're not sure, and then I sit and wonder whether it is going to work.
and I have no idea right now.
I'm proud of you kid.
you're a good kid.
welcome to Songwe.
Congratulations. You're number four.
Oh, baby.
Ta-da!
thank you very much.
you're in the fifth place. - Oh, thank you.
and you-- you arrived in the sixth place.
I've learned that I'm capable of doing a heck of a lot more than I thought I could.
welcome! You've just hit it!
you are the seventh to arrive.
DAVE: I knew that my wife could do anything she set her mind to.
welcome. You just made it.
you are in position eight.
paul: Nothing like I expected.
I just hope it increases our relationship by tenfold, and then nothing'll stop us then.
we made it, and we know we're not eliminated.
now you've made it. You've come in number nine.
I'll be damned if we were gonna be the first ones out.
welcome. - Hi.
you just made it. - Great!
you're number ten. - Okay.
here's tomy sweet daughter. - And to you, my sweet mom.
NANCY: I'm having the best time of my life.
this is the most exciting thing I have ever done.
Matt: There's still one team behind us that I know of.
welcome to Songwe.
Hi. How you doing?
Matt and Ana? - Yeah.
you've come in last place.
I knew that, I knew that.
Wow.
you've both been eliminated from the race.
whoa, bummer.
bummer. - Well...
well, it was nice being here.
nothing we can say or do now, right? - No.
it's been an adventure, crazy
Yeah, it's been wild.
ANA: We had a feeling we were gonna be last, but after doing it, I was so proud of myself and I was really happy, you know, and I was so grateful just to be here.
Matt: We got memories,
I mean, for a long time to come, and it's something that I'm glad we shared together, at least.
stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
on the next episode - of The Amazing Race... - So far so good.
as some teams become allies... - My word is my...
my word is my bond.
...Others become rivals.
paul: Just make sure you punch her in the jaw - or the nose. - You're a fat bitch.
KEOGHAN: And the pressures of the race cause tension within a relationship.
don't tell me to shut up!
I'm really disappointed.
disappointed. - What?
ten teams set off from this tiny village in Africa...
and raced all the way to Paris.
Eiffel Tower.
during the 6, 000 mile journey, exhaustion set in.
I have to have you crying all day long over this.
I don't care what airport.
can you stop?!
we don't have to be...
tempers flared.
you promised me. You promised.
just fix it!
I'm at war. I don't care.
and two teams, Paul and Amie...
I can't even go over there and look at her.
I can lay him out in two seconds.
...and Kim and Leslie...
I'm starting to really hate them.
...Became archenemies.
and she's not with me.
and I'm not with you! - Ha!
you're a fat bitch!
Lenny, afraid of disappointing Karyn, his girlfriend and teammate, pretended to find a clue he hadn't...
you want to go to Notre Dame or what?
...a plan that backfired - See, I don't even know what you did.
and drove a wedge into their relationship. - I looked!
I can't believe you came back down. Just do it!
I'm really disappointed.
well, that ain't nothing new.
the three lead teams formed an alliance in order to navigate the wilds of Africa.
the three of us all the way to the end.
in the safety of Paris, their home for two years, Joe and Bill broke away...
what the hell are we going to help us?
...Leaving the others to fend for themselves.
let's go, let's go, guys, come on. They're leaving.
the fear of losing the race brought Paul to the breaking point.
the more I hear you, the worse I feel. - Let's just go home.
but in the end, it was rivals Kim and Leslie...
how come we're stupid all the time?
...who were eliminated.
please don't say we're the last people. - You've both been eliminated.
we tried.
beautiful Paris!
now, nine teams remain.
who will be eliminated tonight?
this is the world famous Arc de Triomphe in Paris, the second pit stop in a race around the world.
the teams arrived here at the end of the last leg.
each team must stay here for 12 hours during which time they can eat, sleep, and mingle with the other teams.
the nine teams waiting here have no idea what's in store for them.
they must figure out for themselves how to get to the next yellow and white group marker by solving clues they will find in sealed envelopes.
they also get a clue to the location of the one Fast Forward Pass available on this leg.
the team that finds it goes directly to the next pit stop.
now, as darkness settles over Paris, the nine remaining teams receive their new instructions.
pat and Brenda, who found the Fast Forward on the last leg, were the first to arrive at 9: 06 this morning.
they will depart at 9: 06 at night.
the first clue will send teams to this giant Ferris wheel less than two miles away.
it's clearly in sight.
the trick is, the teams will be told to find La Grande Roue, and they will have to figure out that that's French for the big wheel.
time is of the essence, because the wheel closes just after midnight.
see, it's a fat one.
route info.
big news awaits "at La Grande... "Roue.
9: 00 a. m. to 12: 30... ...a. m.
we can't get the re till 9: 00 a. m.
...a. M. 9: 00 a. m?
Oh, with this now 12: 30.
for hours of operation are 9: 00 a. m. to 12: 30 a. m. so we can go there now.
do you know anything about La Grande Roue?
it's here.
see the big thing?
the one with the Ferris wheel?
the big wheels. Yeah, the Ferris wheel?
that's La Grande Roue? Great. - Yes.
Grande Roue? - Yeah.
I think we're doing great as a team.
you know, there's moments of friction there.
we've never had to work together under this much pressure.
I still think the Guidos are gonna be tough all-all the way through this whole thing.
thank you. Au revoir. - Au revoir.
what the hell does this "Grande Roue" mean? - I know.
bill is a "take control" sort of guy.
and on a lot of issues, I just let him do it.
it's-it's the Ferris wheel
thank God I straightened my head out about the time, 9: 00 a. m. to 12: 30 a. m. 'cause I thought it was open for three hours, not 15 hours.
it closes at 12: 30 a. m.
I'm so glad.
so our timing is just about perfect.
Oh, thank God!
all right, what do we got today?
"9: 00 a. m. to 12: 30 a. m." Hmm.
well, not doing anything for a while.
I guess not. - I guess not.
Wow. Shut up, man.
now we're littering, too. Wow.
route info.
we decided to form sort of an alliance.
you know, Frank and Margarita and the two of us are still together, but Joe and Bill decided to go their own way.
hours of operation-- 10: 30 a. m... - This thing don't even start till 9: 00.
big news await s at 9: 00 a. m.
no, wait. Hold on
it says till 12: 30 a. m We can still make it there.
Yeah, yeah, let's go. Come on.
I possess certain strengths, uh, such as physical, and she-she is... She's a lot more cultured than I am.
Oh, the Ferris wheel.
so, her culture and my grit, I think, uh, made a good combination.
au revoir.
au revoir.
you don't want to do the Fast Forward?
no. No, that's-that's sissy stuff.
Frank, come on.
on the right, two cabs.
will you please let us? We have a time constraint.
we have to be down at the Ferris wheel by 12: 30.
we really appreciate it.
they're calling the cab.
they're gonna wait around for a taxi. Come on, man.
we've got 13 minutes.
damn, that sucks!
he said, "Come on, Brennan, let's go."
he gets so frantic that in the moment, he's gonna just, like, diss us.
life is a game of minutes.
don't even believe that cat.
Whoo-hoo!
hustle, hustle, hustle. - Look out, look out.
yellow flag! Ha!
detour. - Detour.
a detour is a choice between two tasks, each with its own pros and cons.
teams must choose the task they think they can complete faster.
Hey, easy walk?
tough Climb.
tough Climb requires the teams to climb up 297 steps to ring Quasimodo's bell.
most people know that Quasimodo was the Hunchback of Notre Dame, and the bell is located at the top of Notre Dame Cathedral.
easy Walk requires the teams to locate the statue of a cat sitting next to Foucault's pendulum.
the twist is, there are two Foucault's Pendulums in Paris.
one pendulum is at the Museum of Arts and Crafts, but the pendulum with the statue of a cat is in a building called the Pantheon.
I have no id ea where that is.
Foucault's...
tough Climb.
tough Climb? - Climb's it.
no, Easy Walk.
we'd better go, 'cause the Guidos are hot on our tail.
Oh, yeah, yeah!
Hey!
Merci beaucoup.
great! Oh, go! - Okay.
Foucault's Pendulum.
hours of operation 10: 00 a. m... Oh, see... That's a museum.
...to 5: 30 p. m. I've seen that
Quasimodo was a name of the Hunchback of Notre Dame.
10: 00 a. m. 10: 00 a. m.
Yeah. - That's it.
everything's tomorrow.
this is 10: 00 a. m. to 4: 45, so there's really nothing to do tonight.
no, there isn't. - We're just kind of hanging out.
okay. - All right.
I'd say if you really want to have a nice long walk, let's walk down Rue Bonaparte.
Yes! Let's go to our old house.
I want to go to our old house.
we're gonna go to our old house, where we used to live here for two years.
this way.
we can have a glass of champagne at Cafe du Magot
Oh, that'd be great.
rob an-and, um, Frank...
they might not even make it here tonight.
Yeah. Hopefully, they won't.
screw 'em.
they won't know what to do.
Whoo!
that's a big one.
what time is it? Come on, Frank.
Whoo-hoo-hoo! - Yeah!
Yeah, baby.
we've got nine hours to figure it out.
we got to get a taxi.
onward to victory!
did you see them anywhere in front of us?
did you see them helping us?
you know what I mean? They got there first, they grabbed the-the thing.
when we get there, high fives, high fives.
if we wouldn't have got there, too bad, whatever.
keep it moving, you know what I mean?
it was not like they were looking out for us.
we're looking for Foucault's Pendulum.
it's in the Pantheon.
Oh, okay. It's in the Pantheon.
Yes. I know where that is. It's right over here.
because it's big, and it swings.
Yeah, great.
perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect.
and it's a good thing we came in and asked. - Yes.
we just have to find out where Foucault's Pendulum is.
Merci.
la Grande Roue. 9: 00 a. m. to 12: 30 a. m.
fast Forward.
visit a tea shop called Mariage Freres, Rive Gauche.
scratch ass.
and where are you from?
new York. Ah, New York, yes.
we need to go La Grande Roue.
Oh, carnival? - The Ferris wheel?
Yeah, yes, exactly. That's it?
Oh, okay. - Merci.
s'il vous plait.
did you see other Americans?
Yes, is come in, is come in.
Oh, they came in? - Yeah, is come in.
Jesus, again!
two minutes is gonna cost us 12 damn hours.
you know what? If they all did, the only way that we stay ahead...
we're the ones who get the Fast Forward.
that's the only shot we have right now.
I hate to use the Fast Forward so early on, though.
Kev, we have no choice. I'm not staying...
I'm not being equal with four other teams 12 hours behind.
well, let's go see, let's go see... - Eight, eight hours behind.
Merci.
each team can use the Fast Forward only once during the entire race, so they must carefully consider when it's most advantageous to go for it.
in this case, the Fast Forward is hidden inside an obscure tea shop called Mariage Freres.
to claim it, teams must ask for a tea called L'aventurier.
we got to make it to the tea shop.
mariage Le...
Oh, my God.
Paul, what are you doing?
Yeah, the stress, it, it drives you batty, you know?
you're, you're in foreign countries. You don't know where you're going.
you don't know where you are.
you're on a plane one day.
we bicker a bunch, but there's been so many other issues and stress factors that we've been focusing more on that than, you know, us bickering.
we've been pulling together pretty good.
we can't do that here. That's what I'm telling you.
why can't you? - Because!
wave your hand. Here comes two.
until this trip, I mean,
I knew her as my mom, but not know her as a person.
Geez!
Oh! Yikes.
you want to just go over here and wait till we... Mom?
I mean, she's, she's a person that never wanted me to ride my bike on, on the regular street.
you know, and now she's jumping off cliffs and letting me do it, too.
when Dave and Margaretta reached the Eiffel Tower in the last leg, they ran past the roadblock clue at the bottom.
a roadblock requires one team member to perform the task.
on instinct, they climbed the tower, found out the clue from Paul, figured out where to go next, and went back down.
it was then that they found the roadblock clue.
technically, one person should've run back up and down to fulfill the roadblock requirement, even though they already knew where to go next.
since neither did, they received a time penalty and have fallen to eighth place.
I don't know where "La Grande Roue" is.
well, that would be the Champs Elys? Es, wouldn't it?
I have no idea where La Grande Roue is, David.
honey, let's just walk and look around.
Oh, please, can you help me, please?
age is nothing on a piece of paper.
age is something up here, and, um, the only time I feel my age is when I look in a mirror, and it almost does me in.
we have other questions-- look, right over there.
big news on La Grande Roue 9: 00-12: 30.
maybe a new store opening, a big new project.
in 40 years of living with her, I've seen her tackle all different types of things.
when she decides to do something, she does it, and she does it well.
it's okay, it's okay.
come on, baby.
I'm-I'm a very competitive person, but I don't think I'm doing 100% right now.
I can do better; I can do much better.
I mean, I'm-I'm no t asking for much.
I'm not trying to jeopardize, or, you know, mess up our relationship.
all I'm saying is let's re-think it.
I hope this is right, babe.
I don't see any flag.
well, we're here.
it says we'll open at 9: 00 a. m.
hello. I'm sitting right here.
Ah, yeah, this is the life.
it kind of stinks.
we finally jumped up to sixth place, and now we're, uh, going to be caught up with everybody again.
excuse me, you know this, uh, tea shop?
a tea shop, we're looking for.
the next one over; the next one up.
where, by that light?
fast forward, baby! - Throw our bag in there.
throw it right in the door. Right in the door.
we have no food, we have no water.
we're all set.
it doesn't get much better than this, huh? - No, this is it.
good night.
good night, Kevin. Good night, Drew.
good night, John Boy.
good night.
Oh. We've been coming here since about 1984, '85 on business trips.
I love this street.
I always said we would be back, remember?
let's go reminisce
and don't cry.
I'm not crying.
I can tell you were going to cry.
go ahead, zip me up.
I'm looking around for a flag, though. - Hey, guys.
Oh, I would love to zip her up in here.
maybe she'd be quiet.
is this legal? - I don't know.
we're with these guys.
so, we lay down on the ground, and everything was really doing well until it started to rain.
that's it.
you want to sit down and get underneath it?
Yeah.
let's go in and see if we can get a cup of tea.
hopefully.
Oh, it's so nice to relax again. - Oh, thank God.
very "Frawnch."
Excusez-moi.
do you know where Foucault's pendulum is?
Ah, yes.
uh, it's, uh, the Pantheon.
the Pantheon? - The Pantheon.
le Pantheon?
Rue St. Jacques?
pantheon.
Hey!
Oh, there's Rob and Brennan. - Hey!
damn it.
foiled again.
we're looking for Foucault's pendulum.
how are you doing?
what's up, guys?
this is easier. Yeah, this is the one to do.
I have a feeling Bill and Joe are going to come to this too, though.
I think they will. I think they will
it only makes sense because they know - exactly where it is, probably. - They know where to go.
this evens everybody out. We all start at 10: 00 a. m.
and they'll also... they'll be in a hurry to get to where they're going to get in line, so they're all going to go to Notre Dame, because they know it.
nobody's going to bother to check for Foucault's pendulum.
it's a "Conservatoire National Des Arts.
so, "walk up to the cat."
walk up to the cat sitting near Foucault's pendulum.
I believe, I believe we are in the right place.
we're going to kick butt, girl.
we've agreed that we are different in a lot of ways.
he knows I'm a worrier.
he's more laid back.
we've sort of leveled each other out.
it's great to be up and see the city come alive, isn't it?
I want our kids to know we can to this, you can do this.
I want our grandkids to have the same love of adventure.
get out there and do it.
it rained intermittently throughout the evening, which wasn't a whole lot of fun, but, uh, with any luck, we'll, uh, get our handsome reward.
I'm hungry and I'm cold.
Oh, excuse me.
y'all have been here since, like, 2: 00?
2: 30, and we slept out in the rain and the cold!
no way. - Why didn't y'all go to the hotel?
what hotel?
hi
Quasimodo. That's Notre Dame. H-Hunchback.
focus pendulum"?!
I don't know where this is.
I say we go back there.
ring Quasimodo's bell.
that's in, uh, Notre Dame.
that's easy to get to.
Notre Dame; let's go.
I just don't think this city's anything special, you know.
this is like, this is just like being down in Soho. - Yeah.
Ah! Are you the manager?
Yeah. - Good morning.
good morning.
geez, why did I th ink it was going to be an old guy who loo ked like Ben Franklin?
Bonjour, monsieur.
do you have a tea called L'aventurier? - Yes, of course
that's for us!
that's for you? - Let's smell it, though, just...
very nice.
a little oregano-y.
fast forward; very good.
congratulations, you ha ve found the fast forward.
go directly to the next pit stop
Chateau of Les Baux de Provence.
"check in at the top of the castle." - Yes!
it's in the south of France? - The south of France?
Yes. Very nice. - Oh, nice.
good. - Nice. We can go to the beach, maybe.
Yeah, well...
is it warm, warmer there?
we're going to the south of France, boys.
this is the ancient village of Les Baux de Provence.
carved from stone over 2, 000 years ago, it sits 300 miles south of Paris in the rolling hills of southern France.
here we are, sitting pretty, we hope, and, um, don't intend to relinquish the lead.
as Drew and Kevin proceed here with the fast forward, all other teams must complete the tasks in Paris.
I can't wait to see the big pendulum.
Yup, that's it.
we're not going to kill ourselves.
we're nice and relaxed, and we can stay this way.
very good.
parfait.
"Parfait"? Perfect.
you going to have a dessert?
"perfect," it means in French. You don't know that?
you know what that statue's called, Renee...?
Foucault!
that's tariff. That's 42 francs to get in.
10: 00 to 6: 15.
Yeah, but what about this?
this one? - I don't know.
Marge, what does this mean?
what, do you need me?
I do... I just need your brain.
I don't need your emotions.
the whole thing comes together, so, see, you can't have the brain...
come on. Don't make me... don't make me lose...
"Tarif reduit" means reduced entry... For people who are students.
if you're a student. A studant.
I have a student I. D.
thank you very much, buddy.
let's go find...
all right, let's take a once around the building, - make sure there's no kitty cats sitting outside. - All right.
there's the pendulum.
there's a pendulum.
Oh, that's it.
so, where's the cat?
Where's the cat?
I don't see a cat.
where to? - That building right there.
which one?
I don't see one.
mom, don't worry. No, I'm not worried.
Notre Dame.
no, but it's not 10: 00 yet.
there's the Pantheon! Yay!
voila!
so say the "Frawnch!
all right, don't get upset. Rob and Margarita are here, and, uh, Frank and , uh, Brennan.
so, smile when we get there, and don't say a word.
don't say where we were.
Uh-oh, we got trouble.
we have trouble behind us, guys.
what people have a gripe with, uh, Team Guido about is that they try to hold other people back with deceit and trickery.
that's just not a good way to play the game.
Bonjour, bonjour! Bonjour.
big, strong guys like you
how come you're not doing the steps?
don't you need a little aerobic exercise?
what did you guys do last night?
Oh, we just looked all night.
we looked everywhere all night.
I'm just trying to think if there's another monument around with a cat. A lion...
but we walked all around here. - Yeah, we did--in the dark.
we made an agreement outside that we'd walk like gentlemen up there in the order that we arrived at the gate
us and Frank and Margarita, then Bert and Ernie.
we're first in line, you know.
two tickets.
come on, Paul!
Oh, my God.
it was by order of who got there.
we were obviously the third there, so when we got inside,
Brennan and Rob, who were first, kept walking.
and Frank and Margarita walked past.
le chat.
over here.
and the gal that was manning the gate finally went, "Guys, guys."
Oh, this way.
Billy was right there.
it's not like we tried to sneak in front of them.
just one, one team.
one team, one team.
why don't you ask any questions? You always just go.
because I was...
we all agreed outside to come in orderly and go in, you know, order of one, two, three, Bill and Joe being the last.
there's a cat.
friends, friends, until the door opens.
they've got to be kidding.
read it.
real mess.
we're getting screwed all the time, man.
trying to let people go in order, and all this stuff, and then we get screwed.
it's another route guide.
find the man in a blue suit.
he's standing across from the Hotel de Ville.
what's going on here?
I thought we were gonna go and ask.
okay, I...
Merci. Au revoir.
bill and I were still trying to intimidate them.
I certainly have taken an attitude where, um, you try to be friendly, but these people are not gonna end up being your lifelong friends.
Taxi! Taxi! Taxi! Hey!
unless cat means something else in French.
sitting near the pendulum. Sitting near the pendulum.
the cat sitting.
is there a cat here?
like an animal? - Yeah.
I've never seen a cat in here.
they're telling us we're in the wrong place.
Oh, please, God.
mom, I don't know where to go.
I don't know where to go.
mom, come on.
What?!
why do we have to run? - It's okay, y'all were ahead of us.
What?! What?!
Hey, Mom!
Paul, now!
find a man in a blue suit. He's standing across from the Hotel de Ville.
Emily. - Yeah.
come on. In here, come on.
I can't see you. - Hey!
you want to ring it, Mom?
I would love to ring a bell.
let's go, come on.
Hey, come up, come up, come up some more.
find a man in a blue suit.
mom, come on!
ring the bell. You got it.
come on, baby, come on!
find the man in the blue suit.
sorry, I can't stay.
got to go.
one thing we're good at is keeping a positive attitude.
no one's as clever as we are.
how did we know there was two?
we can keep up with them, and then we'll take them in the end.
find the man in the blue suit.
he's standing across from the Hotel de Ville.
the teams have to find this man dressed in a blue suit.
he's standing across from the Hotel de Ville.
come on.
we're almost there - Yeah, we might as well just walk.
taxi's might be slower at this point. - Yeah.
so we just go straight down here and we're there. - Yep.
everybody else probably got...
if they got taxis, they probably got caught in traffic.
Where's the map? Where's the map?
Where's the map? Where's the map?
got one.
open it up. - Road Block.
they also got to figure out where it is.
get out of my way.
it's a Road Block.
road Block.
Yep.
they don't know Paris. - Yep.
and they don't know where they're going.
road Block
I don't any yellow flags anyplace else, so that has to be it.
there's those people... up there. - Yeah.
that has to be it.
hello. How'd you do?
Oh, my God. Look who's here.
Uh-huh. So now let's run.
watch it...
run!
for some reason, we just didn't see the envelopes when we got there.
how did you guys beat us here?
shut up! Don't worry about it.
well, come on, come on. - "One of you must perform the task ahead."Choose before you open the field card."
we were the last-- second to the last ones to get to the sewer.
road Block.
before continuing , one of you must perform the task ahead.
a Road Block is a task that only one team member may perform.
somebody's got to do it. You want to do it, or me?
okay, I'll do it. I'll do it.
this task is simple.
walk to a public square called the Place du Chatelet.
it's only two blocks away, but to get to it, one team member will have to find their way underground through the Paris sewers, a labyrinth of tunnels full of steaming raw sewage.
good Lord!
it was the first time throughout this whole thing that we were that close as a whole group.
I mean, it was back to back to back, and people were pushing each other to get down to the sewer
like, "I'm behind him! No, I'm next, I'm next!"
go, Paul, go!
be careful down there, all right? - No fear.
these shoes don't fit me.
I'm going to go as fast as I can.
I know you will.
Bye, Mom; I love you.
Bye, sweetie. I love you
all right, let's go
she could do it, she could do it.
I got pure... 150% faith in her.
Emily is in the sewer underneath Paris, and I am going to the chateau, which is hopefully no more than two blocks away, to meet her.
take your shoes off. - Yes.
put those on.
let me put it in.
the blue has got to go on my back.
put it on.
is that backwards? - Sorry.
that goes on first; I'm sorry.
otherwise you're gonna get all dirty. - Bye!
go, honey
come on!
careful, my love.
Oh, yeah.
I'm coming!
let's go, baby!
I'm coming, Lenny! Come on, baby!
check in at the top of the castle.
get my stuff ready!
here.
castle? No? Castle?
or is that the Louvre?
cause it looks like a castle to me, man.
Hey! I need a hand. I need a hand.
okay.
okay, well, you've got to hurry.
I am, I am; we got to get a cab.
that's the information.
okay.
are you okay? - Yep.
take my boots off.
we're not that far; Frank and Margarit a just left.
drew and Kevin are in the lead, followed by Paul and Amie and Lenny and Karyn.
teams in the middle are Emily and Nancy,
Frank and Margarita, Rob and Brennan.
trailing teams are Joe and Bill, Dave and Margaretta, and Pat and Brenda.
yellow flag. - Flag?
blue suit. Where?
Oh, sh...
it'd be just our luck that we lose this thing in Paris, and we lived here for two years.
we're not going to.
don't... get that out of your head.
I don't believe us two are on top, baby.
Oh, for people who were in last place, we are doing good.
Lenny, come on , help me, baby.
you're looking around.
we got to hurry. - Yeah.
Merci.
how come you can get nervous when you feel like it?
relax. Relax.
relax! - Stop yelling at me.
just relax. - Stop yelling at me.
well, relax. - Don't yell at me!
rob and Brennan.
there's Frank and Margarita.
should we tell them?
Yeah.
margarita, hey - Arles-- the Arles Station. - We know.
everybody's got the same ticket?
go, run, run, run!
in Paris, you know, we've grown maybe a little overconfident.
we lived there for awhile, so maybe a little bit of complacency came into play.
but boy, we way we were snapped back into reality really fast.
we need to find somebody to tell us what train to get.
team Guido knows their way around this station.
Oh, there's, okay, there's those guys.
Hey, you guys, you guys.
we're going to help you. - You remember this.
if we can help some of the...
what we think are the weaker teams... - They called themselves the underdogs.
...so much to our advantage.
this way, this way.
we would rather be competing against Nancy and Emily and Lenny and Karyn.
we all start walking, and we're looking for second class, 'cause we all had second-class tickets.
it's this way. - Hey!
okay, forget it.
no, no, no , no, okay.
and we keep on walking, and we turned around, and Team Guido disappeared.
they slipped off somewhere, and we're like, great.
I don't know where they went.
we helped them get their tickets through to get on the train, and then they disappeared.
is this going to the right place? - Yes.
so, we would have got on the wrong thing and took a bad turn.
thank you.
won't they be surprised to see us? - Such a gentleman.
that's so wrong.
I'm really disappointed.
I mean, if you don't want to help us, that's fine, but don't act like you're doing us this big favor and then expect us not to be upset about it.
they left us.
and if we hadn't looked at our tickets, - we would be on the train going the opposite direction. - I told you guys you can't trust them.
okay, thank God.
thank God in heaven.
and this is the right train? - This is it.
we're sure?
Frank, I just saw Frank, he's here.
okay.
here we go.
this was the most freakin' stressful leg of this whole thing.
so far, so good. Yes, tell me. - Okay.
what you making that face at me for?
we were last but we still in the game.
right, Lenny?
how are we gonna get there first?
let's do this. Let's go, go, go.
this is the village of Les Baux de Provence.
teams have to find the Pit Stop for this leg of the race located high atop these ruins.
the last team to arrive will be eliminated.
look over here, Kev.
Bonjour.
welcome to Les Baux Provence. You are team number one. - Ah, merci, merci, merci.
great news, great news.
huh?
worst to first, worst to first.
top of the world!
who's better than us here, on top of the south of France, huh?
with everybody looking at our behinds, no less.
to get from Paris to Les Baux, tourists often take the main train line to Marseilles
however, there is a shortcut.
locals get off the train at Avignon.
if teams take a taxi from Avignon, they'll gain
there they go. This isn't...
this isn't where we're supposed to get off.
there.
this might turn out to be the best little trick we ever thought of.
Oh, no.
go around the building, Frank.
someone's going. Who is that?
I think that was Rob and them. - What should we do?
y'all, I don't...
our tickets say keep going.
how else would the get to Provence... from here?
let's go look at the...
what time is it? 13: 15?
all right. Yes!
Yeah, we'll be there at 5: 00.
we'll get an hour and a half on them.
Yes!
rob talked to some gentleman who's name was Eric.
happened to live-- he lives in Chateau Les Baux, so it was an incredible stroke of luck.
he said that we should be getting off at, um, the stop that we just got off, which was Avignon.
that we could, uh, get to the castle faster
so we did tell Margarita and Frank, who we've been working with.
we think we're doing okay-- we should get ahead of the other teams by doing this.
were they still here?
I don't see any of them.
Oh, no.
what do you think, guys?
I consider us a team with Frank and Margarita, that's why we shared the information.
hopefully when we get out of the Pit Stop tomorrow, we'll be doing it together again, that's the idea.
they're holding on to us, Rob and Brennan, because they've used their Fast Forward...
and they want to use our language skills, too.
they want to use our language skills.
they're all a bunch of fakes, they all smile in your face, they all plot behind your back.
I don't play that game, I'm real... Besides.
I've always been real.
I'm not joining with anybody, that thing is over. - Yeah, man.
I mean, we're okay - I know. - Okay?
all for one, one for all. We go together. - Yeah.
it's kind of like us against them. - Yeah.
like, we're always at the end of the pile. - Right. Always.
we'll just pull it through at the last second.
well, we're pulling through, though.
come on, let's go. Go, go, go, go, go
that way, that way
I'll relax.
look at the vi - I'll look at the view - soon as I get to the top of the castle. - Oy vay.
since the race began, teams have traveled more than 14, 000 miles.
now, before than can check into this Pit Stop, they must hike yet another half mile up hill.
Oh, we have to climb, like, that?
I don't know.
top of the castle?
you see it?
Yup.
how'd they get here so fast?
there it is.
can you see it up there? Look up. Flag.
Yes.
bon jour.
my name is Frank.
welcome to Les Baux Provence.
you are team number two.
thank you very much.
team number two and my wife Margarita.
thank you very much, sir. And you are?
I am the mayor of Les Baux. - The mayor.
welcome to Les Baux Provence.
you are team number three.
okay.
welcome to Les Baux Provence.
we're team number three.
you are team number four.
four.
come on, guys.
there it is.
where?
right there. - Oh, my God.
welcome to Les Baux Provence. You are team number five.
five? Wow.
Wow. We made up some time. - No.
come here. - Give me one.
we'll all cross at the same time.
hold hands and step on the mat together.
Yeah, but if it just so happened that somebody else shows up and we're eliminated, I'm gonna be fuming.
that's it all the way up there?
I couldn't read him.
come on, Nance.
how do you know we're going the right way?
I don't see it
Oh, my God. Come on, Momma.
come on, ladies. - Come on, Nance.
let's go, we're in it together.
let's go! Underdogs, whoo!
you are team number six.
six? - Yes.
all right, we're six, so we're good.
welcome to Les Baux. You are in seventh place.
you're okay, Nance.
get on the mat.
you are in eighth place.
we worked together, and now I'm really proud of your guys and
and I'm proud of you
that's why we're called the Underdogs.
we got to hold hands on this.
come on, goddess, be with us.
it's not the last team.
Brenda and Patricia, - you're the last team to arrive. - We thought.
I'm sorry to tell you that you've both been eliminated.
who would know that there are two Foucault's pendulums in Paris?
how could we know there'd be two Foucault's pendulums?
we gave it our best shot.
it was out in the courtyard, and you look down inside what looked like a pond, and there was a pendulum swinging over the globe of the world.
so it was really...
we were sure it was the right place.
it was really a sign that we were in the right place, but...
but we weren't.
...we couldn't find out till 10: 00 in the morning when there was no flag.
the whole experience has been great.
full of surprises, it's been rejuvenating.
you know, here we are in our 40s and we're playing this game like we're kids, and it's been great, - it's been... - A lot of fun.
...just fantastic, and that's why we're sad, - Amazing.
cause we don't want it to end. - It's been amazing.
something else to add to our, uh, memoirs.
and we have a few. - We're going to have more.
on the next episode of The Amazing Race.
go on and give me a kiss here. - Oh, yeah.
...and serious conflict for others.
I didn't say... Yes, you do.
you say it every day.
that's too hard, that's too soft.
and an ancient coliseum becomes a modern day battleground for survival.
where are you?!
come on, Lenny!
Yeah, I'm here.
Paul! Where do I go?!

I THANK YOU FOR THE GENEROSITY.
it WOULD BEEN HEAVEN-SENT IF WE HAD THAT CONVERSATION EARLIER.

Oh, MY GOD.
you HAVE TO GO TO 61ST FLOOR.
I'm NOT GOING TO LOOK.
61
we're GOING TO YIELD ERIC AND DANIELLE.
the YIELD WASN'T REALLY NECESSARY.
why WOULD YOU EVER YIELD A TEAM IN THE BEGINNING OF A LEG
knowing THAT THEY'RE NOT THAT FAR BEHIND?
and THEY CAN CATCH AND PASS YOU AT ANY MOMENT
it DIDN'T MAKE LOGICAL SENSE TO ME.
how DO YOU DO THIS?
let I SHOW YOU.
I HAVE FUN.
the CLUE BOX
it's A ROAD BLOCK.
a ROAD BLOCK IS A TASK THAT ONLY ONE PERSON MAY PERFORM.
in THIS ROAD BLOCK,
the ALL-STAR TEAMS WILL FACE THE HIGHEST JUMP
in THE HISTORY OF THE "THE AMAZING RACE.
they MUST STAND OUTSIDE AND WALK COMPLETELY AROUND
then USING THE WOULD'S HIGHEST PERMANENT DESCENDER,
they MUST JUMP OF THE BUILDING AND FALL 660 FEET TO THE STREET BELOW.
once THEY'RE BACK ON SOLID GROUND
they'll RECEIVE THEIR NEXT CLUE.
you WANT ME TO DO IT?
Yeah. YOU'RE LIKE ADRENALINE JUNKIE.
you WANNA DO THIS?
yes
do I KEEP ALL MY CLOTHES ON?
Yep, KEEP ALL YOUR CLOTHES ON UNLESS YOU WANT TO TAKE'EM ALL OFF.

we're NOT REALLY ABOUT GETTING YIELDED AGAIN.
we ALREADY GOT YIELDED ONCE.
but
with ANY LUCK, ONE OF THE OTHER TEAMS GOT THERE
and WERE ABLE TO YIELD THE BLONDES.
so WALK AROUND THE WHOLE THING AND THEN COME BACK HERE?
OK.
which WAY DO I WALK?
this WAY?
it's A LITTLE SLICK OUT HERE.
I'm REALLY GLAD I'M NOT GOING FIRST...HONESTLY.
this IS MORE AFTER MIND TEST THAN ANYTHING ELSE.
it's ALL IN HEAD.
I'm FEELING FOR HER RIGHT NOW.
come ON.
Oh, IT'S INCREDIBLE.
Oh MY GOD. I'M SCARED FOR THEM.
I'm SCARED.
Oh, MY GOD.

Bye. SEE YOU.
there's DANIELLE AND ERIC.
I'm SO GLAD THAT WAS OVER.
I AM, TOO.
we GOT HERE , THE BLONDS GOT HERE.
we OFFERED TO YIELD. FOR MONEY?
for MONEY.
Oh.
I KNOW.
we WERE DESPERATE AND WE DIDN'T WANT TO USE OUR YIELD
but...
it WAS A DECISION THAT WE MADE.
I WAS DEFINITELY DISAPPOINTED.
Oswald AND DANNY NEEDED TO DEAL WITH THE BEAUTY QUEENS.
it's LIKE MAKING A DEAL WITH THE DEVIL.
if IT'S A ROADBLOCK, YOU CAN DO IT
I DON'T THINK I WANNA DO IT. I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS.
there's A YIELD AHEAD.
maybe THE BLONDES ARE YIELDED.
with ANY LUCK WE CAN MAKE UP SOME GROUND.
OK, PLEASE.
we've GOT YIELDED AGAIN?
what?
by OSWALD AND DANNY.
you GUYS ARE PIECES OF...
we ARE YIELDED AGAIN, WHICH IS RIDICULOUS.
why WOULD THEY YIELD US?
because THEY SUCK.
Hey, DANNY.
I GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU.
because WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY MONEY.
it's PROBABLY REALLY HARD FOR ERIC AND DANIELLE TO SEE THE SIGN.
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE.
they're ALREADY LEAVING LATE.
you CAN DO IT NOW.
this IS CRAZY.
let's GO.
whoa.
he's LIKE A LITTLE BUG.
you SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS. I KNOW, I KNOW.
Congratulations.
Danny, THE JUMPING BEAN.
thank YOU.
travel BY TAXI TO THE LOU LIM LOC GARDEN.
Oh, IT'S A GOOD THING WE HAVE MONEY.
Yes. LET'S GO.
there's A TAXI.
there's NO WAY TO EXPLAIN TO ERIC AND DANIELLE
what OUR CONSEQUENCES WERE FOR YIELDING HEM.
it WAS BAD KARMA VERSUS NO MONEY.
we COULD HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED THIS WAY.
hurry UP.
I WAS SO ANGRY THAT OSWALD AND DANNY YIELDED US.
we STILL ARE TRUSTING EVERYBODY FOR THE MOST PART A LITTLE BIT
and THEN YOU SEE THINGS COME OUT IN PEOPLE THAT YOU DON'T LIKE.
so I NO RESPECT FOR OSWALD AND DANNY ANYMORE.
very, VERY, VERY EXCITED.
come ON, CHARLA.
this IS A LOT SCARIER THAN I THOUGHT.
go.
jump SCARY WHEN YOU JUST DROP YOURSELF OFF THE EDGE.
how WAS IT?
that FIRST STEP, JUST JUMPING OFF THE EDGE
it WAS LIKE...
Oh!
thank YOU.
travel BY TAXI TO LOU LIM LOC GARDEN.
MIRNA, LET'S GO.
do YOU KNOW WHERE LOU LIM GARDEN?
Yep - OK
Oswald TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED.
he SAID THEY HAD NO MONEY AND THEY FELT DESPERATE.
when THEY ARRIVED THERE.
the BEAUTY QUEENS OBVIOUSLY CONVINCE THEM
to USE THE YIELD TO ERIC AND DANIELLE
it's GANNA MOTIVATE THEM.
we NEED TO LOOK THE SIGN.
Lou LIM LOC GARDEN
we're SEARCHING FOR OUR NEXT CLUE.
is THAT ON THE LEFT?
no.
we GOT A BAD TAXI
damage IT.
we're RELAXED IN SENSE THAT
we're FOCUSED.
it SHOULDN'T BE CONFUSED WITH
being RELAXED AND NOT HAVING A COMPETITIVE SPIRIT.
come ON, TAXI, WHERE ARE YOU?
there's ANOTHER TAXI. TAXI?
this IS REALLY FRUSTRATING. HORRIBLE.
we NEED TO GO TO THIS PLACE.
Yes.
OK.
wait FOR IT. WAIT FOR IT.
all RIGHT. GO.
I'm GANNA KICK DOWN DANNY AND OSWALD'S FACE WHEN I SEE'EM.
stupid YIELD.
it COULD BE REALLY A KIND OF FREAKY.
I'm NOT GOING LIE TO YOU.
I COULD DIE.
that's SCARY.
that's CRAZY HIGH.
well, THIS THING IS ALL ON HERE GOOD?
this IS THE START
maybe OUR LAST LEG ON THE RACE
you KNOW, THAT'S SCARY.
this IS PRETTY COOL.
that WAS COOL.
I'm GLAD I'M ALIVE.
travel BY TAXI TO LOU LIM LOC GARDEN.
taxi
and KEEP RACING HOPEFULLY WE CAN CATCH UP.
I FEEL LIKE THE PRESSURE IS I DON'T...
I'm JUST TRYING TO GET THINGS DONE
to MAKE BACK SOME TIME THAT WE LOST.
I'm SO MISSED ABOUT THE YIELD.
Oswald AND DANNY ARE COWARDS.
had WE NOT MADE THE DEAL
we WOULD HAVE RUN OUT OF MONEY
perhaps NEVER MAKE THE END OF THE LEG.
with OUR DRIVERS.
as A TASK.
you KNOW WHERE THE GARDEN IS?
Yes, YES.
OK.
hurry, HURRY.
I WONDER IF WE COULD GO MORE QUICKLY.
I WISH THE GUY WOULD DRIVE A LITTLE FASTER.
is IT HERE?
this IS ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS.
too BAD WE CAN'T STAY AND SMELL THE ROSES.
there IT IS.
in THIS DETOUR, TEAMS HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN TWO TRADITIONS OF MACAU.
the CHOICE
noodle OR DRAGON.
in NOODLE, TEAMS MAKE THEIR WAY HEARLY TWO MILES
to THE SECOND FLOOR OF THIS BUILDING
and CHOOSE A NOODLE-MAKING STATION.
they MUST USE TRADITIONAL METHODS
to FLATTEN THE DOUGH AND THEN CUT IT.
making TWO BUNDLES OF NOODLES.
in DRAGON, TEAMS MAKE THEIR WAY
nearly ONE MILE TO THIS WAREHOUSE.
and A DRUM AND CARRY THESE AWKWARD ITEMS 3/4 A MILE
and FIND THESE DRAGON BOATS.
when THEY ATTACH THEIR DRAGON HEAD TO THE ONE BOAT IT MATCHES
they'll RECEIVE THEIR NEXT CLUE.
we HAD EXPERIENCE, DRAGON CHALLENGE

he's CUTTING IT SO THIN.
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN INTERRUPT THAT TO BE A HALF AN INCH THICK.
obviously IT WAS WRONG

today WAS THE DAY
where KARMA BIT OSWALD AND DANNY IN THE ASS.
quite. I MIGHT ADD.
it WAS NOT OUR PROUDEST MOMENT.
no.
using THAT YIELD THAT WE NEVER INTENDED TO USE.
the MONEY IS THE ROUTE OF ALL EVIL.
Oswald AND DANNY
by TOTALLY STABBED NEWS THE BACK.
I've NO RESPECT FOR THOSE TWO.
teams ARE HOLDING NOTHING BACK NOW
and I THINK EVEN MORE ON THIS NEXT LEG.
everyone's GOING TO BE FIGHTING THEIR HEARTS OUT.
we're GOING TO MAKE IT TO THE FINAL THREE IF IT KILLS US.
we HAVE THE ABILITIES TO WIN $1 MILLION.
we JUST GOT TO CONCENTRATE,
focus AND HAUL ASS.
at THE END OF THE DAY, WE WILL WIN IT.
I'm gonna go and see martha.
I want to take her some jewelry.
do you have anything?
I'm sure she'll love it.
when is the right time to exfiltrate a source?
never.
she has held up her end of the bargain
you're worried about her safety.
I'll think about it.
I need to ask you something.
just promise you'll say the truth.
did something happen between you and irina?
nothing happened.
there's only you.
it has always been you.
you were right.
about?
the beemans -- trouble in paradise.
he told you?
not in so many words. He's not a gusher.
no. He's a trickler.
Yeah. Information comes out in dribs and drabs.
he should call a plumber.
to fix the leak.
no? - no.
I missed you.
at racquetball?
Yeah, that's why I lost.
come on.
cause you were thinking about me?
I couldn't stop thinking about you.
I haven't double-faulted so much in my life.
trouble at work.
we have to stop an assassin.
Whose? - ours.
the leadership changed its mind,
and whatever system they were using to recall him is not working.
we have a name? - no.
do we have a description? - no.
do we know when he's gonna hit the targets? - no.
do we know who the targets are?
he was given the names of 14 scientists.
Oh, So all we have to do is find a highly trained killer we know nothing
about before he hits any one of 14 american scientists.
but doesn't it sound fun?
I'll call the sitter.
Oh, we're having dinner with the beemans on wednesday.
you're supposed to bring your meatloaf.
what areyou supposed to bring?
my winning personality.
they need to straighten things out at the centre.
ordering hits and countermanding them.
there they are.
30 years of marriage, and they're still holding hands.
that's sweet.
top-level scientist working on a program to save this country from nuclear weapons.
and they don't have security. Can you explain that?
they feel safe here.
not for much longer.
Oh, no. car won't start.
that's right.
get out of the car! Get out of the car!
Hurry!
well, if that doesn't get the u. s. Government to watch its scientists' backs, I don't know what will.
he's not a former mob accountant in witness protection.
not a former nazi hiding from the mossad.
as far as the general public is concerned,
he's a scientist specializing in navigational systems for communications satellites.
how many people know that's not true?
you. - Me.
a few hundred people in the u. s. Government.
the kgb?
car bombs haven't been their m. o. If they're starting to blow people up
in the middle of washington, they're essentially declaring war.
we've identified every important scientist in the antiballistic missile program.
we're moving them to secure locations.
why stop there?
who knows who else they'll go after.
Oh, sure, let's protect everyone
scientists, politicians, our most important philosophers.
they'll keep us so busy chasing our tails we won't have any time to chase them.
so, run customs and immigration,
last three weeks, see who's going in and out of the country.
other than the usual flags,
we're looking for anyone who pulled a visa on less than two weeks' notice,
and anyone entering for the first time.
they're using a false identity, my guess is it's gonna be a fresh one.
milbank, take the lead on surveillance, get eyes on our top priorities.
tell your wives not to wait up.
Oh, they don't see us anyway, sir.
you wanted to be an fbi agent.
why would they hire a contractor and then change their mind?
some people think it's worth any risk to stop the americans from getting a ballistic missile shield.
others don't agree.
who doesn't agree with that?
if we start killing scientists on u. s. Soil, who knows where it leads?
at best, the secret war escalates.
at worst...
the contractor is from west germany.
there's a strong suspicion he'll use this weapons contact in baltimore.
okay.
I know there's bad blood between us.
But...believe it or not, I feel a camaraderie with you.
a camaraderie? - yes.
you have a funny way of showing that.
this isn't an easy life we've chosen.
but there's no way to get through it without the truth.
what "truth" exactly are we talking about?
in new york, philip was with the woman we assigned him to.
I can think of five different reasons you'd poison our life.
ask philip, then. - I did.
you believe him?
if you start to think of your marriage as real, it doesn't work.
the men don't think of them that way.
it was an arrangement.
do you understand that?
I understand who you are.
I understand what you just did to us.
better to live in reality, elizabeth.
better for you. - better for us, too.
even after this...
I trust you.
I know you'd throw yourself on a fire for the motherland.
him?
I'm not so sure.
how long have you been there?
not long.
Mmm, drinking me in?
right.
Yeah. - Did you restrain yourself from killing her?
I'm starting to get over the urge.
Why's that?
she's just doing her job.
like the rest of us.
that's it for customs.
how many came through new york?
what do we got, sir?
the rest of the east coast.
if that doesn't pan out, we check the midwest and canada.
couldn't we just nuke the russians and get this over with?
as soon as we get a full list of international arrivals,
we might even be able to make a few phone calls, amador,
find out what hotels anyone suspicious is staying at.
you're a responsible man, aren't you, beeman?
well, my father always said so.
except for the time I wrecked his bonneville.
it's an apartment near eastern market -- a studio with a back entrance off an alley.
it's time you and your source started having your meetings in a safe house.
okay. - It's not a car but, uh...
don't wreck it.
can I help you?
is your dad home, honey?
yeah?
I know who you are, what you do.
I know you usually get references before you talk to people.
but we need to discuss a few matters.
go up to your room, sweetheart.
I don't know who you think I am.
I understand you rely on confidentiality, and I'm going to ask you to violate that.
the alternative is bringing people down on you who will destroy your business.
you're making a serious mistake, lady.
someone came to purchase explosives from you in the last 72 hours.
I need to know everything you know abo
lady, don't come into my house and start ordering me around.
all right, just take it easy, little girl, okay?
do I look like a little girl?
thank you.
don't you hurt her!
easy, easy. nice henchman.
okay, take it easy.
it's all right, lana.
you want to go sit down, watch some tv?
you'll be able to see dad from there, hmm?
everything's gonna be fine.
go.
we better keep an eye on her.
we're not going to hurt her or you.
we just need to know what we need to know.
clients -- I talk about 'em, they come back and make sure I can't talk again.
this one won't.
we come from the same people.
we just need to find him.
he's about 6'4," light skin, a little chubby.
friendly guy, actually.
always the friendly ones, right?
you want to see a picture?
do you have a picture?
got pictures of you, too.
can't be too careful...
these days.
I-I need to ask you something, and
well, can't we just...
what? - nothing.
it's been a tough time at the office.
I don't want to talk about work, clark.
we always talk about work.
I'm -- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
no, no, no. No, no, no.
no. Sorry. I'm -- I'm sorry.
I can't see a thing without them, and I need to see you.
do you have any protection?
uh, no. I-I didn't want to presume this was
from my last boyfriend.
he was a jerk.
well, then he didn't deserve you.
you deserve... - A prince.
I've been waiting for you, clark.
that was wonderful, martha.
Oh, ditto.
it's nice to feel close to someone.
it's been awhile.
I really needed this.
me too, clark. - i've been so stressed lately.
I've been thinking about you a lot.
I just...
what's wrong?
it's just work things.
and you are right.
we should talk about other things.
no. You know what? Go ahead.
that's what I'm here for.
well, the department's gotten very competitive.
our new boss was in the marines.
so, if you don't deliver, you are out.
that's awful.
I think I'm okay, but I-I get worried sometimes.
and right now, with this attempted assassination
this scientist -- Do you know about that?
of course.
so none of the agencies are working together to share the information.
each one wants to be a hero, so nothing is getting solved.
and our boss is blaming us,'cause we're oversight.
but it's like -- I'm sorry.
do we have any control over the divisions?
and now he's saying if we don't come up with something, he's gonna bring in a new team.
he can't do that.
he's done it before.
but the crazy thing is, martha, all of the information is out there.
it just needs to be put together.
and people like -- sorry, no offense
your boss, who I actually think is a good guy,
they're afraid of what might happen to their careers if they don't play the same game everyone else is.
anyway...
well, is there anything I can do to help?
just getting it off my chest has been a help.
that's sweet.
but you know I could get anything that agent gaad has.
if you could solve this thing, maybe you'd be the hero.
maybe even get a promotion.
show that marine who's boss.
Yes, I like.
they thought we should have a regular place to meet.
somewhere secure.
is that what you told them?
a place to "debrief" your agent?
it's true.
it was their idea, actually.
the other day...
I was drunk and...you were upset.
whatever happened...
I am the one who kissed you, remember?
I do.
thank you for getting a place for us to meet.
it's safer for me.
good.
things are tense at work.
arkady is worried.
about what?
something. I don't know.
for two days now, he's very serious.
has there been extra cable traffic back and forth to moscow?
no.
anything unusual in the diplomatic pouches?
not that I see.
have arkady or anybody been going out for meetings?
not more than before.
you are worried.
like arkady.
is something going on?
I don't think I should have gotten you into this.
so now guilt?
I had a job to do, nina.
just think how you will feel looking at me dead one day.
no. That's -- we can get you out, nina.
I wasn't bullshitting about that.
it takes some time, and they have to feel like they've gotten enough to make it worth it.
I do everything for you.
I am trying my best.
that's not...
you're not here because...
I am here because this is where I want to be.
would you care for a drink?
you buying? - I am.
so, what's your thing? - my thing?
oral? Anal? Ecclesiastical?
I am much kinkier than that.
I'm really glad you guys were able to make it.
and this is truly fantastic.
what is the secret?
horseradish. Right?
Oh, you cook, phil?
he watches. - I can relate to that.
well, it's got a real nice kick to it.
good. - you don't usually like things too spicy, stan.
I don't. But I guess I do.
you want some more brussels sprouts, paige?
no, thanks.
how about you, henry?
no thanks. I already had some.
I bet you want some more of those mashed potatoes, though.
they're kind of cheesy.
no, I-I meant cheesy, not cheesy.
no, it's fine.
well, it's not fine to be impolite.
