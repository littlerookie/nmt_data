what were you thinking? Why wouldn't you just take the test?
it's been a year, Betty Anne. A fucking year.
I don't trust them. I'm not doing it.
what?
I'm not doing it.
Jesus Christ, Kenny, are you out of your mind?
this is it. This is what we've been waiting for!
what, you're not gonna take the fucking test?
why now, all of a sudden, out of the blue?
why can't you be in the room when they test me?
they won't allow that. They're not gonna agree to that!
so, I'm supposed to trust a bunch of staties to do it?
this isn't a choice. You have to do this.
it's gonna test positive.
they'll find a way. They're gonna fuck me again.
you'll see.
I'm leaving.
you'll do it, or I'll kill you.
that's your sister and your lawyer talking.
what the hell is going on over there?
why don't we have the test results yet?
the evidence is still sitting in the crime lab.
just sitting there?
it takes six months to approve the testing, five to decide how to test it, and now they're doing nothing?
that's what you're telling me?
Martha Coakley is definitely stonewalling this.
are we having a famine?
I have teenagers, remember?
look, do we even know if Kenny's DNA ever made it to the lab?
or if the crime samples are still there?
it's there.
have you seen them?
why aren't you doing anything about this?
we call the DA's office every day, and the crime lab, the interns have sent, like, 8, 000 e-mails.
interns? Jesus, Barry, this is beyond interns!
it's just gonna take some more time.
great. You and your interns take your time while Kenny rots in jail.
fuck. Okay.
you shouldn't take it out on Barry.
you're right.
are you Dr. McGilvray?
Yes, l am.
Betty Anne Waters.
I need the evidence for my brothers trial sent today.
excuse me? I'm sorry, I'm don't know who...
the DNA evidence from Kenneth Water's trial.
why is it just sitting here?
we have procedures to follow...
I'll tell you the procedures. Test the goddamn evidence today and fedex the result to Ed Blake's lab in California,
how hard is that? Why don't you leave your name and number with Lois here, and someone will...
so, what is it? Martha Coakley's telling you not to do it?
excuse me, I have a meeting that I'm late for.
or is there some promotion you'll get if you kiss her butt?
you can't keep fucking with my brothers life like this!
you have my name and number. I called, many times.
mom, let's go! We're gonna miss the kickoff!
I'll be right down!
shit. I forgot my phone!
when's the last time you used it? I don't remember.
call it. Maybe it'll ring.
Yeah. You check my desk. Okay.
Where's it coming from?
the couch.
holy shit. What?
he's innocent! What?
uncle Kenny's innocent! It wasn't his DNA.
kenneth Waters is eliminated as the source of the male blood.
Oh, my God.
you guys... Oh, my God.
we did it. You...We did it. We did it.
we did it. We did it. We...
I love you guys. I love you.
it was all you.
is this what I think it is?
Yup.
is this for real?
Yeah. We did it.
you did it. You fucking did it.
when am I getting out?
a few days. A few days?
I can't wait a few days!
why not? They know I'm innocent!
Hey. Do you hear that, motherfuckers? Waters.
I'm innocent.
negative DNA test. Waters. Waters.
I'm very happy for you, but take your seat.
okay. My baby sister's a fucking genius.
you look great. They can still kick your ass.
she's getting me out of here.
sit down and finish your visit.
so when? What do you think? Monday? Tuesday?
no. I have to hear back from Barry.
as soon as he reaches Martha Coakley and she vacates the conviction.
well, you tell Miss Martha fucking Coakley
I want a shiny new limousine picking me up, with a fully stocked bar!
you gotta call Mandy for me.
you gotta call her and tell her they know I'm innocent.
I will. As soon as I get out of here, I will.
tell her I'm getting out.
tell her I miss her and I wanna see her.
will you tell her that?
I will.
I love you, Kenny.
I love you.
I love you.
Mandy, this is your Aunt Betty Anne.
you probably don't remember me, but I really need to talk to you about your dad.
it's very important. It's nothing bad.
I mean, it's great. We finally found the evidence that proves he's innocent.
so he wanted me to call you and let you know.
so he thought...
you have zero messages.
Hey, you guys hungry?
I'm gonna throw you a sandwich up. I've got ham and tuna.
mom, if you throw a sandwich up here, the roof will cave in.
very funny. I'll remember that when you wanna bring a girl up here.
at least Uncle Kenny'll think it's nice compared to jail.
Barry? Hi.
thank God! I'm going crazy here, and Kenny's going absolutely insane.
I know. I'm sorry.
did you reach Martha Coakley?
Yes.
What'd she say? How long is it gonna take?
there's a problem.
she said...
that there was still enough evidence to try you as an accomplice.
so I'm not getting out?
not now. But.
I'm sorry, Kenny.
it's okay.
I can't do this anymore.
Kenny.
can't
it's not fair, you know. It's not fair.
I gotta go. Kenny.
I'm gonna kill that fucking bitch! Kenny.
I'm gonna kill her.
waters. Sit down.
Kenny.
Kenny, Kenny, listen to me.
we can't give up.
we...we have Barry on our side now. No, no, no.
and we will fight her in court.
Hey, you tell Barry forget it, okay.
we're way past that, little sis.
take care of your boys. You gotta move on. It's over.
it's not over. It's over, honey.
it's not over. Why? It's over, honey.
fuck her. I fucking knew it. Motherfucker.
Kenny, sit...
waters! Motherfucker.
sit down, or you're out of here!
Hey, man. Haven't you heard? I'm never getting out of here. Never.
I'm here forever, man.
remain down.
Hey, get out of my face, shithead. Come on, sit down.
I tell you that it's over. You understand?
I said, sit down!
I'm talking to my sister. Move...
visit's over.
take your hands off.
Kenny, Kenny...Kenny, don't.
that's not nice...Motherfucker. Kenny!
motherfucker. I told you to stay out of it.
Kenny!
take him down. Don't.
motherfucker! Motherfucker!!
motherfucking bitch! I told you. Don't.
didn't I fucking tell you?
they made fools out of both of us.
they made fools out of both of us.
Betty Anne. Settle down now.
we're fucking chumps.
we're fucking chumps. I told you.
Kenny's in solitary, for Chrissakes!
why is everyone congratulating me?
you proved he's innocent.
Yeah, well, not to Martha Coakley, I didn't.
we'll fight her.
we are not going back to court.
Kenny will not survive another trial!
and I'll be damned if we have to prove his innocence all over again just because of that evil bitch.
there won't be a trial if we gather new evidence.
how are we gonna do that?
think about it.
the DNA doesn't just prove that Kenny's innocent...
it proves all those witnesses were lying.
Rosseanna?
Oh, shit.
well, see, what happened was I was threatened, okay?
who threatened you?
don't I know you from TV?
Oh, yeah! I know! You're that famous Jew lawyer.
Roseanna, who threatened you?
you know, that fucking cop, Nancy Taylor, had it out for Kenny.
she kidnaps me, right? Her and this Chief of Police.
and they take me to this room, this hotel, against my will.
that ain't legal.
and they get me drunk. You know, am I gonna argue?
and the Chief of Police, he's wanting me to pray with him.
you know? So I get down, I pray, for forgiveness, forgiveness...Forgiveness for what?
cause they fucking lied, saying they had all this evidence they didn't have, telling me that I'm gonna be an accessory, and threatening to take my daughters away.
I was absolutely, totally sick.
I mean, I puked. I mean, you should have seen it.
I never seen pictures like that before in my life.
Oh, my God. This is the part.
pictures of Mrs. Brow?
...just happened.
he's your husband's best friend.
Yeah, the pictures.
you know, the fucking pictures.
you know, you've seen them.
she had stab wounds all over her body, and her brains are coming out and everything.
and I just went...
you know, I went hysterical. I was hysterical.
and I broke down and, you know, they were talking at me, like, "You want this to happen to you? "
you know, you want a fucking murderer walking out on the street?
it could happen to anybody.
your mother, your kids, you. You, meaning me.
so Nancy Taylor said that
Kenny could murder you or your mother or your girls?
Yeah, she fucking did. That's exactly right.
excuse my French.
I mean, there was a lot of thing that wasn't quite right in Denmark.
and I was trying to put it together, I just...
I mean, I was telling them.
I was, like, I was fucking plastered at the time.
I don't remember what Kenny said.
and you'll sign this affidavit once we're done?
I can't live like this any longer.
Betty Anne, I'm sorry.
I know I put your brother in there. I know I did, I did.
I'm sorry.
but I was up against a wall, you know, I was railroad.
I told them Kenny is innocent.
you know?
Nancy Taylor, she fucking...
she says, "Once I get my lead, I never let it go. "
so, I just need to know, you'll sign this affidavit, then?
Yeah.
so, after we leave here, we'll just...
you can come with us, we'll just quickly get it notarized.
what about perjury, then?
what about perjury?
Yeah. If I sign this, then everybody's gonna know I lied before.
what's the statute of limitations?
I didn't know she could say so many syllables.
I'd like to knock out the rest of her teeth.
taste in women was not one of your brother's strong points.
Mandy? Yeah.
I'm your Aunt Betty Anne.
your father's sister.
what do you want?
did you get my messages?
I...I gotta go.
I really need to talk to your mother.
she's not home.
please, your father's innocent.
my father's a murderer.
no. The DNA test proved he's not.
wait. Did she give you his letters?
he wrote to you every week!
no.
he's innocent!
ma, are the pancakes almost ready?
Hey, guys.
anybody up for a drive?
any pancakes left back there?
Oh. You wanted some?
Richard! Give me One.
forget it, you lose! Hey!
immature. Immature.
Hey, come on. Come on.
you're gonna make me crash. Here.
one pancake.
okay.
you guys gonna tell your father this is how I made you spend Christmas?
your secret's safe with us,
besides, we're willing accomplices.
you guys would do this for each other, right?
if Ben tried to go to law school for me,
I'd die an old man in prison.
don't worry about it, I Wouldn't do it.
you wouldn't?
I mean, I'd want to help and all, but I don't think I could give up what I really wanted to do.
which is what? Sleep till noon and hang out at the mall?
shut up. What, you'd do it for me?
Yeah. I would.
you'd sacrifice your whole life for me?
when you put it like that...
forget .
you think I sacrificed my whole life?
it's okay. Come on. Hey, give me the gift.
come on, let's go.
merry Christmas. Mandy, these are your cousins.
Thanks, but this isn't a good time right now.
I'm sorry. Merry Christmas.
okay, here. Sorry, I can't take that.
come on.
the boys got you a video.
God knows long it'll take to approve it.
do you remember the year they wouldn't let me give you Babe?
Hey, here we go.
happy New Year.
we're getting close, everyone!
nine, eight, seven, six, five, four...
...three, two, one...
I'm working.
please.
l have this memory where I'm sitting on the kitchen floor and I'm like three or four years old, and my mom and aunt are talking about
daddy's shirt being covered with blood.
I couldn't figure it out. You know, I just didn't understand why Daddy's shirt was covered in blood.
it wasn't.
she lied?
the DNA proves she did.
why would she lie like that?
I don't know, honey, but that's what we need to ask her.
did he really write me every week?
for 18 years.
even when you were just a baby.
is he getting out of jail?
they're not gonna let him out without new evidence.
why not?
because people don't like to admit when they've made a mistake.
we need a statement from your mother.
I can't control what she does.
Yeah, I know. Either could Kenny.
you know, if Massachusetts had the death penalty, your father would be dead by now.
he made that for you.
he's had that on the wall of his cell this whole time.
after me and Kenny split up, I had this boyfriend,
Robert.
and he says that we could get money from the cops if we rat on Kenny.
so he goes to Nancy Taylor and says that
I told him that Kenny confessed to Mrs. Brow's murder.
Nancy Taylor tells Robert he can fuck himself.
and she hauls me in, brings me to this hotel, makes me look at all these gross pictures.
and she says that they can prove I was an accessory,
and that they'll take Mandy away.
Hi. Do you guys have a printer I can use?
can you guarantee I won't go to jail if I sign this?
no. l can't.
sign it, Ma.
Martha Coakley, please.
no. I have Barry Scheck calling and it's urgent.
ms. Coakley?
Betty Anne Waters.
look, Barry's tied up right now, but he wanted me to let you know that Brenda Marsh, your key witness in the Kenneth Waters case, has just recanted her original testimony.
and we just faxed the affidavit, and so you should be getting it shortly.
hang on, here's Barry now.
Martha! Yeah. That's something about Brenda Marsh, isn't it?
Oh, really?
listen, I just wanted to give you a heads up while you're deciding whether or not to vacate Kenny's conviction, the folks over at the Boston Globe and the New York Times, they just love this story.
no. They're all over it.
Yeah, the phone's been ringing. Yeah.
great. All right. Okay, bye-bye.
are all sides in agreement to vacate the conviction?
Yes, Your Honor.Yes, Your Honor.
Yes, Your Honor.
kenneth Waters, you're free to go.
that's it? That's it.
Hey, those 18 years, man, they're gone.
right now, I'm...
how could you possibly thank your sister for what she's done for you?
I don't know. How would you thank her? It's a good question.
Betty, you have any big cases lined up after this?
no, no, no. I never really planned on practicing law, so...
is this for us? This is for you.
we chipped in.
Hey. Kenny, Kenny, Kenny.
Hey.
what? Look who's here.
where?
it's Mandy.
that's Mandy? Yeah.
go talk to her.
just two seconds, guys.
Hi.
Hi.
you're so beautiful.
my whole life, I thought...
not your whole life.
what my mother did to you...
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
that's not your fault.
that's not your fault, honey.
Oh, come on, let's get out of here. Come on.
come on.
lake Betty Anne and Kenny.
lake Kenny and Betty Anne.
even if it had taken you another 20 years or so,
I would've been okay.
another 20 years?
Jesus. I would've lost my mind!
no, I mean, you know...
knowing you were out here, knowing that you loved me that much.
in July 2009, eight years after Kenny was proven innocent,
Betty Anne won a major settlement against the Ayer Police Department and former police officer Nancy Taylor.
due to the Massachusetts statute of limitations,
Nancy Taylor was immune from criminal prosecution.
Betty Anne continues to co-manage Aidan's Pub and works for the Innocence Project on cases and legislative reform to prevent wrongful conviction.
there have been 254 post-conviction DNA exonerations since 1989.
the murderer of Katharian Brow has never been found.
what goes on inside your head？ Walking slowly towards the night. There's nothing wrong with me you say. You kept me spellbound by the hour. And I try, I tried with all my might. And I try, I tried with all my might. Did I let you down?
did you want too much?
did he steal your heart when you felt his touch?
did I let you down?
did you want too much?
did he steal your heart when you felt his touch?
saw you again the other day. Walking fast into the night. There's nothing wrong with me, you say. I think I just saw the lie. And I try, I tried with all my might. And I try, I tried with all my might. Did I let you down?
did you want too much?
did he steal your heart when you felt his touch?
did I let you down?
did you want too much?
did he steal your heart when you felt his touch?
well, I've been bad before. And I know the feeling well. They're always there. I can sense you. There's always a heaven where there's a hell. Oh, did I fer you down?
did you want too much?
did he steal your heart when you felt his touch?
did I let you down?
did you want too much?
did he steal your heart when you felt his touch?
did I let you down?
did you want too much?
did he steal your heart when you felt his touch?
did I let you down?
did you want too much?
did he steal your heart when you felt his touch?
did I let you down?
did you want too much?
did he steal your heart when you felt his touch?
you know how I usually love your ideas?
no. - Right.
well, the idea of us all vacationing together is so bad. I'm making up a word- Gag-bysmal.
families vacation together, and we are just like any other family.
we got the dreamer, the schemer, the queen bee, the damaged goods, the iron fist, and the one we all feel sorry for.
well, one which am I?
no, no, guys. I'm not going to tell you.
pipe down, damaged goods. - I knew it.
if we go on a trip, it should be someplace incredible, like...
France. - Cracker Jack factory.
cracker Jack factory? - France?
what if we go to the wine country?
I'm in. Done. - Like it. For sure.
mister, we're gonna see where you were born.
we are gonna pound so much grape. We should get a driver.
since Trav dropped out of college, he's free.
that's not funny. - No, it's okay. I'm coolio.
no one who says "coolio" is cool. That's why coolio's named coolio.
Yeah, I'll finally get oh my life together coolio.
and get my own apartment, then Trav just slides right in and becomes me.
Mama-san.
must be time for my daily scolding.
look at you. You've turned into some kind of ne'er-do-well.
what's that?
I don't know. Something that Ellie called him.
it's an irresponsible, idle person.
well, then you're king ne'er-do-well.
nailed it. - Thanks.
so I called your college and said you left school because your grandmother has syphilis.
it's ok. There's a little truth to that.
Nana Cobb?
we're moving her to a less "swingy" retirement home, but let's stay on you.
Travis, I know that you asked a girl to marry you, and she said no, and that just really sucks, but you can't run away from your life.
this isn't about Kirsten anymore. I don't know what I wanna do, but I know I'm not gonna find it trapped in a classroom going through the motions but not really alive like some sort of ghost.
I don't believe in ghosts, because if they were real, I'd like to think that I would be felt up all the time.
I feel like we're done here, so... Same time tomorrow?
sure, honey. Love you.
why are you in here holding my baby?
uh, because I assume no one else does.
honey, is it okay if we draw six-pack abs on an to pretend he's a roided-up baby wrestler?
you've already done that, yes?
I've got a message to all the babies out there.
okay, if you step to my crib, you're getting a diaper full of ass whupping,'cause I'm bringing the pain.
do you hear me, brothers? Do you hear me?
I hope it was worth it,'cause now you have to take him to the park.
can't. Bobby's taking me sunglasses shopping.
if you guys are in a bind, I can take the little bruiser.
you are a lifesaver. I have to get that allergy shot today, remember?
I'm glad I could help. - Thank you.
you really getting a shot?
no, but I'll find something to do.
since Travis isn't listening to me, you. I should tag in one of you.
fine. I'll just - Not you.
I'll do it. He has a crush on me, so I can make him listen.
just give me my parameters. Is middle school style okay?
under the shirt, over the bra? Or are we going full-on ninth grade?
in which case, i'm gonna need to rent a hotel room or maybe a boat.
Ellie, look how scared she is.
can you blame her, jelly bean? - No. I've done more for less.
all right. See you guys.
I just got the chills, or I was just felt up by my first ghost...
maybe. Did you like it? - I did.
Ellie? - Oh, sorry. I thought it was Grayson.
let me guess. You two are going on tour with Huey Lewis?
I wish.
no, bobby got us these so we can do that '80s movie thing guys do when a hot chick walks by.
Damn!
shouldn't one of you be biting his finger?
I'm gonna go practice that in the mirror.
babe, let's go do something. I'll call - Can't.
I promised Bobby I'd help him pick out a new bed.
we like the same firmness, so...
if you're leaving me for him, don't drag it out. Just do it.
ever since he got money, you two are spending way too much time together.
I'm just helping him nest. It's a guy thing.
it really isn't.
even tastier walking away!
here's your little fella. - Oh, sweetie.
Tom - yeah.
take him to Andy.
Tom's our inter-house shuttle. I pay him with head pats.
sounds normal. Thanks for letting me watch Stan. I love kids.
what are you gonna do about that? - What?
you always say you're done having kids, and he wants a baby so badly, I can hear his clock ticking.
guys don't have clocks. Ah, here you go, tom. Here.
thank you.
U're wrong. Old ferret eyes is, like, 4 centimeters dilated right now.
he does want kids eventually, but it's not like he's obsessing on children.
la-la, la-la ? - Elmo's song ?
Oh, crap.
so this is just your life now?
hanging out on a boat, wandering into town with your robe on to get a sandwich?
you know, you're very close to turning into that music producer who murders people.
God, I love Subway.
U can pile on all the toppings you want, plus they do breakfast now.
and with the 12 bucks I have in my pocket, I can eat for what, like, 30 years?
Travis, if my mom had paid for college, I would have never blown it off.
my mom stole my hair and sold it to a doll company, so I'm stuck here forever.
just this morning, I saw this big billboard, and it said "cheap tickets to Hawaii, and I thought, yeah, you know? Why not?
why don't I just max out my credit card and go to Hawaii?
what? Am I making any sense to you? - Perfect sense.
well, thank you, ladies.
now it's our bit because we have bigger glasses, and we added the hand thing.
how'd it do?
Travis moved to Hawaii.
that was pretty good. Let's do it again. - Don't.
okay, so I've been trying to call Trav, but he won't pick up, so finding him is not going to be easy.
Hawaii is not just one island. It's a group of islands. The largest one is Hawaii.
time-out. So is hawaii one of the islands, or is it all of the islands?
brace yourself. Both.
that's ridiculous. - No.
Thanks, Tom. Here you go.
Oh, take this to Ellie's, will you? - On it.
so... He just goes in our house now?
Jules, Travis texted me.
he's on the north shore. He's trying to scam a job at the turtle bay resort.
okay, now I just have to go over there and get him.
well, he's my boy, too, so I'm coming with.
it's my fault that he left. I'll go.
we were just talking about a group vacation.
sweetie, I-I can't. I- I have too many commitments and responsibilities.
that was good, right? - Yeah, that was good.
can't we just call Trav or send him a strongly worded e-mail?
dude. - Stop being a parade rainer on-er.
we're taking a group vacation!
unfortunately, it's to save my son from making a life mistake that he...may never recover from.
in Hawaii! - Yeah!
Hawaii.
what? Grayson's not here. We all do it.
you know how it was my job to call the hotel and switch our 2-bedroom suite to single since my mom's watching Stan?
I kinda got sidetracked.
he drove me to get a toothbrush for the trip, but along the way, we saw the county fair.
long story short, we may have won a square dancing contest.
idiots. Go on.
so we're stuck paying for two bedrooms, unless - Sell it, Bobby.
I know this guy who also can't get a room.
now since there's an extra bed, and there's three of us...
can I get in on that?
stop it, Barb!
I'm in love with a man who wants me to be more demure.
Oh, no. - What's "demure"?
I'll work through it. Ta.
Bobby is not staying with us.
the door to his bedroom locks, and he has his own separate entrance from the outside, so he will never be in our room.
plus I'll pay half. Come on. Say yes. Please?
do you promise never ever to open that connecting door, even if you heard 38 special playing a private gig for us in our room?
well, that's impossible. They're jamming down in Tampa this weekend, so...
Yep. I promise. I promise, I promise.
good god.
I always let Andy pack for me.
he brings crazy slutty outfits, and then I get to shop.
crafty. I don't think I can shove my body into a bikini right now.
I mean, I have a serious case of winter legs.
Oh, please. You'r mwah.
what is with the stomach kiss?
but with all the stuff going on with Trav, I just-I can't deal right now.
when he wants to talk about babies, you just talk about something he doesn't wanna think about.
like how I wanna try living together for six months, and if it works, we sell one of our houses?
his house. - That's the Chicago way.
he pulls a knife. You pull a gun.
the untouchables.
Oh, is that that movie about the boy in the bubble?
I can't watch it. It's too sad.
did I say something funny? - Not on purpose.
Oh, shoot. All right, how much time do I have left to pack?
Oh, the car got here ten minutes ago.
well, help me! - All right.
just cram it in.
wow, look at this place.
they really say that. That's a real thing!
okay. I know we're all excited. Laurie made that clear on the plane when she stripped down to her bra because she said it looked like a bikini top, which it doesn't.
can we all try not to act like idiots?
look what we got at the gift shop.
can you believe them Jul-Jules?
waterslide in a sundress!
it totally does. - It doesn't.
it's impressive.
and a pretty view.
I wonder how long it will be until some fat guy in a banana hammock ruins it.
five seconds.
Andy, you...
I wonder if Bobby's scared being all by himself.
I didn't have a job for your son, but I pointed him to this address.
it's a shack outside town where broke travelers caget a good night's sleep.
okay, my baby's in a shack.
thanks for your help, Blake. - My pleasure, Ms. Cobb.
all right, let it out.
Blake. So pressed and put togeer.
plus with that black eye, you know he's fun.
he can manage my hotel anytime!
mine, too.
Oh, my gosh, you guys! Look at the little baby in the hula skirt.
it is amazing that you can have one of those just slide out of your body.
slide, my ass. Travis came out doing the splits.
you ever think about doing that again?
I'm just talkin', drinkin' a blue drink.
Yeah, I think about that stuff all the time.
like being here, you know? If we can get along so good in such a tiny hotel room, imagine how comfortable it would be to live together in a big house.
I - I should go pay the tab.
the Chicago way.
got the rental. - Shocker. It's perfect.
Travis has no job, no friends, and he lives in a shack.
he's gonna be dying to come home.
no way! Aloha, guys!
I taught everyone penny can except here we use a coconut and a rock.
Coco-rock!
mom, I'm sorry. I should have told you what I was doing.
you think? - I just got inspired and went with it.
it's like last thaksgiving when I got the idea to make the pumpkin bread, only way bigger.
I've been having nightmares that you joined a pack of hawaiian hobos.
you're fighting no-legged dogs for fish scraps.
I had a no-legged dog once.
he couldn't stop rolling over and over and over.
I know it's no time for jokes, but that was gold, baby.
Hey, what's up? - This is my boy.
I'm Ted Buckland, but, uh, people call me "the buck.
I'm betting they don't. - I'd like them to.
Ted is mad famous. He can take any song and make it sad.
that's a useful skill, and I wanna see it. But,Travis, I need to talk to you.
I wanna kill myself. - Thank you.
mom, I know you're worried about me, and I wanna show you that I'm okay, but it's gonna have to wait until tomorr, because I'm going to this party, and I'd invite you, but, uh...
locals only, brah.
you've been here three days! - Right?
from the moment I saw you, I felt ? come on, everybody!
he lives in a shack.
he sits on the beach all day and parties all night.
what kind of life is that?
an awesome one. - Best life ever.
first time I've ever been jealous of him.
good friends would lie.
big Kimo will make me feel better.
he likes to put rum in his breakfast smoothie.
is that the candle holder from your room?
mm, don't worry about it.
since the, uh, hotel shops are closed,
I thought you guys would like to see what my husband thinks is appropriate resort wear.
it's for the lady who likes to lounge by the pool but also get paid for sex.
you can do that? Is that a job?
it's ridiculous. - I'm not stupid.
Hey. You know, I know you're worried about Trav, but it's not all bad.
you have great island hair.
you know, when the wind hits it just right, I look like i'm in a duran duran video.
listen, I'm sorry I bailed on you yesterday when you brought up moving in.
so rude.
especially since I've been pestering you about whether you want another kid.
you know what? We should talk about it all tonight.
Yeah, after your day with Trav. - The Chicago way?
what? - What?
What'd you say? - Nothing. No, I think that's great.
all right. - Okay.
brace yourself, big kimo. I'm coming in.
Andy, come help me take the tags off my new clothes so you see how much money you spent.
did you know that hotels charge 30 bucks for socks?
Bobby and I spent the last two hours inventing a knock language.
that guy.
that guy. You realize you can just walk out there and just see him?
it's not the same.
Yeah, we wanna be inside friends if you come in here and invade my space, i'm gonna chop you up and feed you to...
she's the volcano goddess.
I bought a $200 book on Hawaiian culture at the gift shop.
I got it. - You may enter.
I love you, too, man.
it's a coconut tree. Oh, one hanging coconut.
shake it. Oh, shake it harder. Oh, oh. Ow! My head. I'm dead.
Hawaiian suicide.
this is my favorite beach.
I come here every morning after I stop at that Kona coffee hut.
the best cup of joe ever. Am I right?
it's all right.
I hope I never pee this out.
you're right. It is beautiful.
hiking up to that waterfall this morning, I started to believe in god even more than the time that I prayed out uncle norm's foot cancer.
still lost his foot. - Yeah, he's alive.
what are you gonna do for money? - I already have a job.
when elderly tourists get sick, I sell 'em fake prescriptions.
No! - Kidding.
look, I'll show you where I work, okay? But for now, can we just enjoy the view?
fine.
Oh, my god! I wanna snort this.
compliments of the manager.
Thanks. You're a prince, v.b.
V. b? - Vacation boyfriend.
mark my words, I'm tagging that.
I hear a classy girl.
we're watching the loop on the hotel channel.
with seven restaurants to choose om, Bobby, remember that fun talk we had about invading my space?
cause back home, I recall you going to get a new toothbrush, but then you got...
sidetracked. Now my toothbrush is wet.
go. Go.GO.GO.GO.GO.GO.GO.GO.GO！
did you use it? - No.
then why is it wet? - It's humid here.
why isn't yours wet? - I blow-dried it.
why would you do that?
if it's wet, it feels like someone else used it, and it grosses me out.
show me your toothbrush. Why? - Can't. It's on the beach.
why again. - Well, who wo't wanna brush their teeth by the ocean?
it's the Hawaiian way.
is it?
this is your job? You wax surfboards?
Yeah, brah.
you don't even surf.
you know what they say. Those that can't do, wax.
calm down, Buck. - Oh, yeah! Buck's in the house!
I gots to say, I like working with my hands.
please. You used to put on gloves to play in your sandbox.
will you admit it?
life here is pretty sick. - So sick, dude.
okay, let's stop kidding around. What the hell are you doing?
see? I told you so.
cause it looks new, and it says "turtle bay resort" on it.
must be a chain.
Really? A chain? - yeah - When's the last time you were at the hotel? - Last year.
where? - Ohio. Cincinnati.
what is your problem? Dad thinks my life here is cool.
your dad doesn't worry about the future. He lives in the now.
well, that's a beautiful thought, isn't it?
Travis, I have talked to you about this a thousand times. I am done!
so pack up your pineapples, brah! 'cause we're going home.
I'm sorry, but I'm almost 20 years old. You can't tell me what to do.
that's not how it works anymore.
Aloha. it means "hello" and "good-bye.
well, how dumb is that?
look, you raised a good kid, okay? Everything's gonna be fine.
I mean, that's when I think about having my own kid. I'm like - oh, seriously? - What?
Grayson, my only son has just thrown away college and is living in a shack with a 50-year-old bald man.
I- I-I can't go through this again, honey. I can't. I'm so sorry, but...
I'm done with having kids.
you know I love you, right?
I love you, too, baby.
I was up all night trying to be okay with not having a kid.
I'm just so overwhelmed about travis.
and this baby thing is too big to solve this weekend.
okay, let's just take the whole conversation and cram back into our suitcases.
baby in a suitcase. I love it.
we'll just talk it all through when we get back, but until then, let's concentrate on having the sexiest trip ever.
sounds great.
you cool if we brush our teeth first? - Oh, god, yes.
garlic shrimp.
more pineapple, lover?
is it because U'm feeding him pineapple, or because I'm calling him "lover"?
E" ticket, what's with the shirt?
I'm wearing it for us.
it keeps away all the chatty cathys that wanna be our resort buddies.
you have a soft way about you.
I'll tell you where she won't be wearing it-the bedroom. What's up?
Ellie, I'm not dropping my hand until you five it. - Have fun.
did you all decide that it's okay for Travis to drop out of college?
no. You know, Trav's having fun now, but he'll regret throwing away that opportunity when he's a, uh...
how old am I? 40. - 40.
why are we pretending that everything's fine?
denial kiss.
but look, Travis is an adult. Oh, good god. Here.
Thanks.
look, we talked about it, and Travis is gonna do what he wants. It's his life.
I am gonna say something now that meredith baxter birney has said in every TV movie I have ever seen.
I... Will not give up on that boy.
Bravo. - Nice.
Hey, y'all. We're from texas. Where you from?
I'm never taking this off.
crap. I forgot my lip gloss. - No, me, too.
Hey, butter works. - I love when you get all hillbilly on me.
it's like that time you got that pregnant raccoon out of my garage just by making that noise.
Hey, lover. Sorry.
look, there's 40 towels lady.
they're for everyone!
Oh, wait. Have you seen Seinfeld guy? - No.
Why's it so hot? Where's my lotion?
I'm gonna go grab a swim, okay? - Oh, I love when you grab stuff.
I'm gonna grab a gun.
stop it. I'm trying to stay sexy all weekend because I...
don't you dare. I will bother. I will bother hard.
he wants kids. You can't hide from that. It's a bomb.
eventually, it's gonna explode and take your face off.
no face.
Hey! You wanna go fool around?
man! I've been awake ever since I got here. I mean, I don't get this time zone crap.
how can it be one time here then another time at home? This isn't "star trek.
I wonder what you're doing in Florida right now. - Stop it!
you know how at home Ellie is a lame stick in the mud? - Definitely.
vacation llie is ballsy. She likes to take adventures.
I like to take it slow, let the vacation find me.
I married that sentence.
I wanna see the wonders of the banyan forest, okay? Get off my ass.
you know it this is the first time that I've ever been to take a real vacation?
and I wanna do it all.
what say I do all the sporty stuff with you and all the lady stuff with Andy?
you'd be our vacation surrogate?
if that means what I just said, then hell, yeah.
babe alert. Be cool, Ted.
I don't know how.
well, just go see if we have a hacky sack or something. Chicks love those.
Hey. How's it going, brah? Good to see ya.
you, too. Gosh! Hawaii is really good for you.
you should stay here. Oh, no, wait.
moving here was a huge mistake, Travis. - Same old Laurie.
look, you can't ditch out on college just 'cause some dumb girl broke your heart.
this is not about Kirsten. This is me, happy.
I will go "animal house" on that guitar. - No.
you know what? i'm gonna grab my stuff. You wanna walk me to work?
Yeah. Okay.
what are you laughing at, chuckles? - 'cause it's a girl.
that's how we bonded. We both had our hearts broken.
my girl's name was... Gooch.
she ran off with a guy named Hooch. - Hooch and Gooch?
you didn't stand a chance. - No, I did not.
hooch is crazy.
Ooh, let's spin-kiss like they do in the movies.
okay. - Okay.
one second. - What are you doing? We're spin-kissing.
Yeah, I just need to find my multivitamins 'cause I gotta take them today.
here they are.
I meant my birth control pills.
that's ironic. - Give me one sec. I'll find 'em.
Yay! I forgot them.
how could you forget your birth control pills?
they're part of your morning routine song.
brush your teeth, wash your face ?
take your pills so you won't get pregnant ?
don't get that song stuck in my head again.
let me give you what Andy and I use.
nothin'. I made him get his manhood snippety-snipped.
had to do it two times.
50 million men of steels.
brush your teeth, wash your face ?
you know, if you added a nice little bridge to that, it could really rock.
I'm so bummed I forgot my guitar.
well, you're the only one. - I hate you.
everything here is closed on sundays.
I don't wanna spend the next 24 hours ridinground Hawaii on a condom hunt.
that would make a great reality show.
and why aren't we looking for a condom? - I have no idea.
Hercules, Hercules.
Hey, why so mopey?
are you sad 'cause you can't get that coconut?
I spent two hours yesterday poking that with a stick.
no. It's not that. It's just...
come on!
sorry. - I can'stop thinking about Travis.
I feel like you and I know better than anyone what it means to mess up your life when you're younger.
that kid is so stubborn. I wish I knew how to change his mind.
I think I know, but he is gonna hate me for it.
well, what do you have to do?
come on. Let's go have fun, just the two of us.
score! Date. - No, man.
it's okay. He'll wake up in a few. Look, I'd love to hang, but I gotta work.
Travis, I miss you.
okay. Let's go.
score. A date!
let's get this couple day goin'! Hey, Andy, a lel for you.
Bobby, it's so pretty.
and, Ellie, a sports drink for you. Gotta keep you hydrated, baby.
hells to the yeah.
now who gets couple time first? - Out of my way, half pint.
adventure!
keep up, you wuss! - I haven't slept in 34 hours!
look at the bany - pretty cool. They're magnificent.
keep up, you wuss! - I haven't slept in 36 hours!
man! I'm so tired!
isn't this great?
you know, in ancient times, Hawaiian warriors, to prove their manhood, would wait right here and battle sea turtles as they came in to breed.
Really? - I don't know. Maybe.
Youerk.
so beautiful.
it is.
Oh, my god! Something touched my foot!
it's just a fish. - Awesome. Get me out, get me out.
Oh, god. I guess I gotta eat the sword and deal with my v. b.b.
very... Big biceps?
no, Vacation boyfriend breakup.
what's up, baby? - Hey, blake!
Hey, they look like suckers. You ready?
well, you made me rehearse for two hours, so yeah.
Hey, guys, where you fr - I'm supposed to start.
Hey, guys, where you from? - Kansas.
man, you're gonna love this place. I promise.
Yeah, just hanging out and having fun in the adult pool.
you know, having adult fun in the adult pool.
this guy knows what you're talking about, don't you, big fella?
are you hitting on us? - no. Oh, my goodness.
Yikes. no no no no no - Really?
do you have any condoms?
well, there's my boys. - I missed you.
I missed you, too. I'm gonna give it to you.
I had such a great day.
well, it's the lea I could do after the toothbrush incident.
so you admit you used mine?
no, I just feel bad about it.
why would you feel bad if you didn't do anything?
what I think Ellie is trying to say is... Thank you.
Aw, Anything for my sugar-kids.
surrogates. - Surrogates. There it is.
all right, come on. I made dinner reservations.
awesome! Where are we headed?
Oh, I just thought it would be the two of us if tt's okay, because I haven't seen him all day.
Yeah. No problem. You kids go have fun.
thinking about being a turtle warrior, aren't you?
I would be an amazing turtle fighter.
I had an awesome day today, Travis. - So did I.
you're not thinking about Kirsten at all right now, are you?
what?
look, I know that you came here to forget about her, so don't try to tell me that you didn't
and even though jules would die if we ever got together, I feel like if I told you it was possible, you would come home and go back to college.
so what, you're saying it could happen?
no, I'm saying that you shouldn't make life decisions because you're running away from one girl or trying to follow another.
so that's what today was about.
proving a point?
no. Travis, I just...
I want you to admit that you wanna go back to college and you wanna get a cool nerd job and have cool nerd kids.
okay, Laurie, you're right.
my mom will be happy. Great job.
please don't be mad at me. - It's too late.
I scored a condom.
high school rching band leftheir suitcases in the lobby.
total sluts. Come here, you.
Hey, fella. - My mom said I could get my truck.
then you should go do that.
I got my truck. - Yi-yi-yi-yi-yi.
what are we doing? I've wanted kids my whole life.
if we're gonna stay together, I have to know that u will at least consider it.
no, The baby's in the suitcase. - This is serious.
I know. I'm hiding.
I've spent this entire vacation hiding.
Travis is throwing away his life, and there's nothing I can do about it.
I'm scared of losing you, and I don't know how to fix it.
everything is falling apart, and I'm just running around the beach, pretending that it's not.
can we please just pretend for a few more days?
please?
I really wish I could.
Hey. Have you guys seen Grayson?
no. - Well, at least you two are here.
you know, this is the first time on this trip that it's been just the ladies.
it's an embarrassment of bitches.
well, I know why I'm down. What's going on with her?
Travis is coming home. - Oh, my god! That's amazing.
he just hates me now.
Oh, honey, tell me what happened.
brush your teeth, wash your face ? check your nose just in case ?
eat your breakfast, bacon and eggers ? take your pills so you won't get ? pregger?
morning routine song ? - Morning routine song ?
bought a ukulele.
was it expensive? - No. Just 5 bucks. Why?
Andy, give him 5 bucks.
that was so rock 'n' roll. - Uncool.
okay, surrogate, I hope you packed your balls 'cause we're gonna go hang gliding over a volcano.
then, boom! Sunset jazz cruise.
no, thank you. I think I'm just gonna, you know, chill by myself.
why is everyone so mopey around here?
because the rest of us aren't in a perfect relationship.
I'm betting when Bobby imagined his first vacation, he was with someone.
spending time with you two in alace like this - Make anybody wanna kill themselves.
we win at couples. - Yes, we do. Ooh, free drinks.
I'm just so happy you're coming home. Okay, you have two options.
I'm gonna give you the biggest hug right now, or the whole walk back to the hotel, we're gonna hold hands.
I reluctantly choose big hug.
Bummer,'cause you smell like dead fish, but...
Oh, dear lord. Wow. Nope. It's ripe, but it's still a nice moment.
one more thing - Forgive Laurie.
Travis, you are so young.
you have no idea how lucky you are to have a friend that would do anytng for you.
I don't know, but I'm gonna go grab my stuff. - All right.
Hey, you came all the way here, but you still let me gure things out, and...
solid mom-ing.
love you.
You-you-you okay?
you know, kids are torture, but moments like that make the whole adventure worthwhile.
I wouldn't know. I got hooched and gooched.
sounds painful.
maybe it was for the best. We wanted suchifferent things.
if someone's really the one, they should be willing to go on any adventure with you. Right?
right - You're tearing up.
don't worry. I do this all the me.
now you got me going. - Oh, god.
all right.
how you doing, bud? - I'm fine.
Ah, to tell you the truth, i'm a little lonely.
is it okay if we hang with you?
Yeah, I'd like that.
thank you for watching out for me.
you know, I really did have an awesome time yesterday.
me, too.
you know, as far as girlfriends go, I'm a handful.
this is true. - I'm bossy, insecure... Crazy.
does that cover it? - Sometimes you're loud.
and yet... You always stay with me.
I'm so lucky to have someone like you.
I will go on any adventure with you.
cool.
can you remain still, please? We're about to begin.
polygraph for cia admission.
a few questions for control.
your name is annie walker? - Yes.
you're 28 years old? - Yes.
you reside in washington, d.C?
Georgetown, yes.
you speak six languages?
I travel a lot.
languages come naturally to me.
yes" or "no" will be fine.
Yes.
okay, annie, I'm going to ask you some personal questions.
now, you told us in your vetting interview that your last serious relationship ended two years ago.
Yes.
and you met abroad.
Yes, in sri lanka.
I was backpacking. He was teaching english.
that's impulsive.
is that a question?
did you love one another?
Yes, we were in love.
the sex was good?
it rocked.
Bu-but it, uh- it ended badly.
Yes. It ended badly.
did that bother you?
after a three-week whirlwind romance,
my supposed dream guy left me in the middle of theight with a cryptic note and a $50 bar tab.
wouldn't that bother you?
we're looking for a "yes" or a "no.
can you repeat the question?
the question is this
if you join the cia, will you be able to separate your work from your personal life?
Yes.
Absolutely.
trainees, listen up! This is no granny hop!
this is low-altitude, 2,000 feet a. G.L!
you step, grip, and rip, Or we'll be picking you up off the ground with a spatula!
any questions? No? Good!
now, who's first?
Annie walker - I should've guessed.
we have orders to bring you with us.
look, whatever the problem is, I'll retake the exercise.
if it was the driving course or the deception training or...
what was it?
you did better on the driving course than any woman we've ever had
and better on deception training than anyone in a decade.
so is this about me hooking up with my tae kwon do instructor?
cause I checked the handbook. It's not against the rules.
I - I'm gonna shut up now and let you talk.
I've got orders from langley.
you're to be pulled from training and sent to headquarters.
there's a case in which your language skills are needed.
what case? - I don't know.
what language? - I don't know.
all I know is that they need you there today...
now.
now, like, now?
now.
Oh, I-I still have a month of training left.
now.
CIA.
this late at the cia, you must be new.
first day?
I'm annie. Do I look that clueless?
no, not at all.
I'm conrad.
I'll show you where to get your badge.
so is this, like, your thing?
you wait outside the entrance and chat up girls on their first day?
Absolutely.
I'm both lazy and predatory.
see the guards ahead?
they'll get you all squared away.
you may want to get that passkey before you try to get through security.
I'll do that.
uh, annie walker.
good morning.
russian desk and D. P.D. are on call due to the petrov visit and other classified actions.
however I am deeply troubled,
because at this critical time for our agency, someone among us is a traitor.
today's paper-classified information leaked to liza hearn At the washington recorder.
someone here, someone maybe in this room
has been seduced by an outsider, By a reporter.
in the end, All indiscretions end in heartbreak.
I, anne catherine walker...
when the guilty party is caught...
that I will support and defend...
and we are gonna find out who has been leaking this information...
against all enemies...
and they will be punished...
so help me, god.
10: 41 a. m.
Annie walker? - Yes?
Auggie anderson, tech ops,
and your friendly neighborhood cruise director.
walk with me.
blind guy leading you around the cia
insert ironic joke here.
Jo malone grapefruit?
am I wearing too much perfume?
no. No, it's very subtle.
a lot of the ladies around here lay it on so thick,
it's like they're chumming for hammerheads.
good morning, auggie. - Hey, bea.
case in point.
everyone here is so young.
there was a hiring freeze that was unfrozen after 9/11.
50% of the agency has five years experience or less.
that's both inspiring and weirdly unsettling.
you'll find this is a weird place to work.
polygraphs every year, no cell phones allowed inside the building,
no dating foreigners.
in fact, the cia highly encourages dating within the agency.
keeps things in the circle of trust.
it's like a club med without the free drinks.
and the food court's on your right.
there's a starbucks in here?
imagine a year of background checks
just to get a barista job.
Hey, how are the legs?
you know, a bag of frozen peas would help keep down the swelling.
I'll bear that in mind.
from the inane yet vaguely sexual banter, I take it you've already met conrad sheehan.
let's go.
welcome to the agency, annie.
he works for arthur campbell? - Yeah.
and he acts like it too.
okay, here we are - joan campbell's office,
head of D. P.D. and our boss.
wait. You're not coming with me?
I'm not going in there if I don't have to.
NSA is sending over the files you requested,
and annie walker is here.
Annie walker. Great to meet you.
have a seat.
actually, we're in a bit of a hurry.
do you know who sent me here?
I was just looking for some clarity.
clarity? You're in the wrong business, sweetie.
better question might be, why do you want to be here?
the cia is not an easy place to be a woman.
I can handle a competitive workplace.
well, you're gonna be outnumbered here four to one,
outnumbered by men who'll hold the door for you and call you "ma'am" and know how to fix a tire.
but clarity, honesty?
that's another story.
how much do you know about the domestic protection division?
uh, I've actually never heard of it.
good.
that's the way we want it.
every global threat that finds its way past our borders is dealt with here.
Hello, auggie. - Joan.
screens. - Coming up.
the landscape looks like south ossetia.
I spent six months there helping rebuild the opera house in tskhinvali after the uprising.
the figure you see on-screen is stanislav orlovski,
aka "stas" - born and raised in moscow.
this satellite photo was taken when stas was in prison in siberia.
he made a deal with the fsb and soon became one of their top operatives.
he's a skilled assassin, wanted in 14 countries,
and he is now ours.
stas came in from the cold two days ago, and he wants to talk. - Talk?
he's unhappy with the new regime at the fsb and wants to supply us
with a list of their current targets in exchange for asylum and compensation.
it doesn't pay to hold a grudge in the spy game.
where do I fit in?
you've been assigned as stas' handler.
you go to the hotel where we have him, wait for his call,
and bring this. A blackberry.
that is a dedicated two-way encrypted transponder that only looks like a blackberry.
he has one. You have one.
you hot-sync the devices in the room.
he gets the bank codes for his payment,
and you get the intel, and that's it.
don't have a drink with him. Don't sleep with him.
you think I'd sleep with him?
I think he'd sleep with you.
did you call me in here because I speak russian?
Yes, and you can also pass for a call girl.
we want to make it look like stas is here to buy guns and party, not sell secrets to us.
I'm surprised there was nobody already here who could do that.
there was. She's gone.
let's leave it at that.
look...
if you don't want the assignment, we can send you back to the farm.
no, I'm here. I can do it.
I-do-do I have to wear, like, a costume?
hookers in d. C. are pretty conservative.
what you're wearing now is fine.
here, you're going to the capitol grand hotel.
wait in the lounge area.
when this pager vibrates,
it means we're ready to do the meeting.
it's like waiting for a table at Friday's.
instead of sitting down to eat a bourbon-drenched egg roll fajita skillet,
you're gonna help us turn one of the most dangerous men in the world.
Auggie? - Yeah?
can I ask you a question?
I was special ops in iraq.
I got out of a humvee to look at what I thought was a dead dog.
next thing you know, I'm ray charles.
I was gonna ask what the headphones are for.
Oversharing-my bad.
grado rs-2s...
great for monitoring operations,
getting real-time feedback when I'm typing,
or listening to mingus when I'm supposed to be working.
Mingus? - Yeah.
I went to the mingus tribute festival in stockholm.
you're officially my hero.
that's your ride.
wish me luck.
you don't seem like the type to need luck, but good luck.
gotta love those kitten heels.
would you like anything?
I could get the waiter for you.
tea, coffee, a glass of wine?
it's 11: 30 a. m.
something stronger, then?
I'm good.
perhaps we could get a drink later...
a nice cava.
cava? Are you from Spain? - Si.
Valencia? - Madrid.
unfortunately I don't think I can get a drink with you.
your mother warned you not to date foreign men, huh?
something like that.
Hello?
english is fine.
I'm in your country now, baby.
do you have your pda, stas?
you have a little wardrobe malfunction happening there.
close call. Come on.
do you have your pda, stas?
one minute, one minute, huh?
Chateau d'yquem...
almas iranian caviar...
you're certainly rockin' on the agency's dime.
not as good as russian caviar.
look, can we just focus on the intel?
Where-where is your pda?
it's in the bedroom, kiisu.
please, to follow me.
just keep your robe on.
look, stas, I understand how hard this must be to turn on your country.
that's probably why you've had a few.
I just want you to know that the cia is grateful, and we're here for you.
so can we do the exchange?
shall we, uh...
Hot-sync?
I thought you'd never ask.
beep.
was that as good for you as it was for me, kiisu?
get her out of there now.
this way! Let's go! Let's go!
Joan, we need to keep the information channels clear.
I'm giving you all I can, arthur.
what can you give me?
I feel I've been pretty transparent.
and I feel I'm still having to navigate a lot of red tape.
things of this magnitude are complex.
there's complexity, and then there's lying.
okay, this is good.
this kind of dialoging is what this marriage needs.
you know, this whole couples counseling thing
ultimately is useless until arthur gives me the name of whoever it is he's screwing.
I'm not having an affair. How many times do we have to go over this?
you see that? You were blinking like crazy, arthur.
he was blinking like crazy!
any trainee could see that he is lying.
want me to take a polygraph? I got one in the closet.
yeah?
Joan, we have a situation.
what went wrong? This was supposed to be simple.
it all happened so fast.
I was talking to him one minute, and the next,
the room seemed to explode.
some operatives go an entire career without seeing a bullet fired.
is that supposed to make me feel better?
it's supposed to make you realize this is unusual.
thankfully, it all worked out.
it all worked out? Stas is dead.
bad for stas, good for us.
the agency saves some money and gets to delete a known assassin
from the high security threat list at the same time.
whatever that intel was, it was worth killing for.
what?
the intel.
I didn't get it.
you said you did the hot-sync.
I did, but in the confusion,
I didn't grab the device.
well, this just gets better and better.
district police and fbi are already on the scene.
once our devices become evidence,
all the intel is corrupted.
gone.
I can go back. I can get the intel.
Annie, we don't just waltz into places, Flash our badges, and assume jurisdiction.
we don't even have badges.
plus you can't just take evidence
from an active crime scene.
she doesn't need to take anything.
she just needs to get in the room.
and what are you going to tell the detectives and any number of people at the hotel
who will have pegged you as a witness or possible accessory?
I'll think of something.
try not to break or lose this one.
what's the range on these? - About five feet.
and when I beam this one out?
the other two devices will fill up With the harmless-looking phone book we loaded on there,
and you'll download the intel.
ingenious. So simple.
the system we devised before you got shot at was ingenious and simple.
now we're just riffing.
excuse me, ma'am, closed crime scene.
are you in charge?
you need to turn around and go back downstairs.
no, but...
I was here when it happened.
uh, what were you doing here, miss, uh...
I had a business meeting.
what kind of business are you in?
I don't want to get in trouble.
look, we're not going to bust you If you say you're a...
call girl.
we don't like to use that term.
Really?
it's crowded in here.
Yeah, well, it's amazing
what 57 high-powered rifle shots can do to a party.
are you a detective?
agent rossabi.
and if you don't mind, I'll ask the questions.
can I sit down?
look, I'm a good girl.
I come from a church-going family in akron.
I just wanted to come forward and be honest.
my mother told me to always do the right thing.
who was the john?
we call them clients.
the agency said his name was boris.
russian businessman.
this was our first party together.
what's the agency?
the gold circle club.
I can write down the number if you want.
that'd be great.
nice pen. - Thanks.
302 area code?
Delaware? - Wilmington.
you know, tax reasons.
did you see anything through that window?
no, but I wasn't really looking.
we didn't get a chance to...
I wasn't here long.
I was standing about here.
well, more here.
excuse me, boys.
the shots came through here...
and I ran out as fast as I could.
I don't really remember much else.
I should really get goin'.
am I allowed to leave?
I wouldn't leave town.
let me ask you this.
why'd you really come back?
and don't give me the, uh,"good girl" rap.
U! - For these.
christian louboutins don't come cheap.
FBI secure exchange, line one.
gold circle club, where pleasure is our pleasure.
how may I direct your call?
let's see why this intel was worth dying for.
khyber intercept? - Useless.
info on kaladze's political aspirations?
we already knew that.
georgian troop movements from last July?
light samsonite.
what does that mean?
it's an old spy term. For when spooks used to stuff their suitcases with crumpled newspaper
to make it look like something valuable.
either stas was too dumb to know what good intel is, or he thought we were too dumb.
given the fact that he's dead now,
it's probably the former.
there's nothing here of value.
type up a closer on the stas file and get it to me.
we're done here.
stas is dead, long live stas.
word to the wise.
these pipes haven't been cleaned since the johnson administration. I'd invest in a bottle of evian.
you all right?
I saw a man get killed today.
I lied to a federal agent.
I was shot at.
or as we call it, "Thursday at the agency.
asset entanglement,
evasion techniques,
deception.
these are all words they use in training.
they make it sound so clinical,
but it's not. It's...
it's messy, and it's dangerous.
it is messy,
and it can be dangerous,
but you're doing it well.
now, it's miller time.
happy hour at the tavern.
that's your solution?
Oh, absolutely.
one drink.
probably best if you drive.
Hey, auggie.
Tia, lovely as always.
Auggie, are you coming to my party saturday?
wouldn't miss it, jane.
ladies love a blind guy.
they think we don't care about looks.
think? - Little secret.
you don't actually have to see a woman to tell if she's hot.
you just listen to the way other guys talk to her.
take yourself, for instance.
Annie walker, I'm so sorry to hear
that you had a hectic first day.
if there's anything the d. C.S. Office can do.
I rest my case.
Thanks.
Conrad, right?
you remembered. You must be very good with names.
Oh, come on, this is getting ridiculous.
who needs another beer?
I'm just gonna assume you see me raising my hand.
why do you think stas tried to sell us such bad intel?
just because a guy can shoot a sniper rifle doesn't make him smart.
intelligence can be a bit of a misnomer.
Yes.
so tell me, why'd you get into this?
you certainly don't fit the profile.
I thought there was no profile.
and yet everyone joins for some reason, and it sure ain't the pay.
tell me, I can take it.
I traveled a lot before I came back to d. C.
I don't know what I was looking for,
I'm not sure I found it,
but I got to use my language skills.
and I met a guy.
Ah, it's always about a guy.
go on.
we fell in love in sri lanka,
and it was a tearful good-bye.
a tearful farewell at the airport, a la casablanca?
more like he left like the baltimore colts In the middle of the night.
anyway, I kept traveling.
I went to all the places that we said we'd go together:
tibet, angkor,
giza,
rapa nui.
but no matter how far I traveled,
I couldn't get away from the truth.
which was?
the truth was that I let my guard down.
the cia and the life it offered was appealing.
I wasn't gonna get burned again.
man, you do fit the profile.
liar.
Joan, please meet sheila calhoun,
legal counsel for the oversight committee.
Sheila, meet my wife, joan.
I can't believe you. After all that denial.
no. This is completely work-related.
Arthur, may I have a moment, please,
away from your girlfriend?
excuse me, sheila.
have you lost your mind?
phone records.
13 phone calls made from your scrambled cell phone to hers.
four reservations at various d. C. restaurants all made on your opentable. Com account.
do not tell me I am losing my mind.
you're using valuable agency resources to track me?
that's not a denial.
why can't you be a good cia wife and just trust me?
because I'm not a cia wife.
I'm a wife who works for the cia.
who's next?
Oh! Oh, okay. How about that girl?
she smells great.
all right.
vintage irish heart ring,
crucifix on her neck,
lsat prep book in her purse,
holds her liquor. I'm guessing boston college.
maryland accent, not baltimore.
traces of dublin.
I bet her parents are first generation off the boat.
and she's fit, huh?
her heels barely made any noise when she was walkin' by.
in fact, she was walking a little gingerly.
I'd say she's training for a marathon.
okay, time for more drinks.
Oh, my god! I was supposed to be at my sister's house an hour ago.
I live in her guest house. We do dinner every thursday.
that's okay. - Sorry, I gotta go.
wait. How am I gonna get home?
excuse me. Did you go to boston llege?
I did. Did you?
I did. I went to law school there.
I'm studying for the lsat!
I aced mine. I'd lend you my study guide, but it's in braille.
we should talk. I'm auggie.
Louise. - You have the softest hands.
who the hell are you?
D. E.C. Method
determine, evade, counter-pursue.
Oh, man.
come on, you piece of crap car.
No!
leme see this.
okay, okay, the deal was you could stay up
till annie gets here, remember?
good night. - Good night, annie.
good night, annie. - Bye.
see you in the morning!
where have you been? - I was working.
well, we're about to start eating.
Ethan is really looking forward to meeting you.
come on, help me in the kitchen.
what's the matter?
he's cute... In an archie comics sort of way.
I just forgot we were doing the whole ethan thing tonight.
I thought it was just our usual dinner.
Oh, come on, you guys have a lot in common.
he works at the world bank,
you work at the smithsonian.
you both have really boring jobs.
everybody, this is my little sister annie.
Oh, look, there's an empty seat next to ethan.
Annie, why don't you take that one?
here you are. - Thank you.
are you okay with that? - Yeah, thanks.
Well...So, stuck in traffic? - Traffic, right.
this petrov speech has got the entire northwest quadrant completely gridlocked. Did you want that?
I normally take m street to get to georgetown, But they had that blocked,
so I ended up going all the way up connecticut avenue,
you know, past the zoo and then...
Where's this going?
down wisconsin.
around and around in circles today. Nuts.
just crazy. - Can I have some wine?
uh, red or white? - Uh, whatever is closer.
red? Sure, here.
let me, uh...I brought this.
it's wonderful if you like zinfandel.
it's a ltle pricey,
but very good.
there we are.
thank you. - No need to be shy.
uh, a toast, guys?
to annie arriving, huh?
seriously, do you, uh
do you play racquetball by any chance?
well, uh... - Are you squasher?
go for a drive
and just get out of the city.
on the drive, you know, I usually
turn the music up,
just lift my shirt off and just, you know?
Yeah, I shuck my own oysters.
have you ever, uh - you ever shucked an oyster?
I would love to shuck some oysters with you.
sorry about the chocolate mousse!
drive safe.
well, I think that went pretty well.
well, that makes one of us.
good night.
we're leaving in five minutes.
all right.
aunt annie, we're eating waffles!
okay, guys, guys. I gotta go.
Bye.
I'm late, so bye.
okay, kids, go get ready for school.
dude.
I'm sorry ethan was such a dud.
it's fine.
no, I thought I vetted him, but he turned out to be a completely different guy than I was told.
I can't believe he tried to kiss you.
what?
kiisu. I gotta go. I gotta go.
well, don't be mad at me. I said I was sorry.
I'm not mad. I just gotta go.
I was trying to help, you know.
I mean, it's been ages since you had a real relationship.
it's weird.
okay, now I am mad at you, and I still gotta go.
welcome, miss hearn. So glad you could make it.
I brought along some legal counsel to brighten up the room.
would you like something to eat?
I'm sure you've heard about my cia-trained chef
culinary institute of america.
so this is the famous arthur campbell charm offensive.
so you're not hungry.
I'm not giving up my sources. - And you shouldn't.
but the people in our agency who are talking to you are clearly unhappy with the status quo.
maybe I could help them.
I've given these people my word.
I would go to jail for them.
let's hope it doesn't come to that.
let's cut to the chase.
what do you want? Everybody wants something.
I just want to file my articles in peace.
I think you want more.
I think you want relevancy and access and accolades.
there's nothing wrong with that.
so what do you want?
let me be your source. - On the record?
that would be tough.
and so it goes.
recognize this meeting as me reaching out.
what you do with that is up to you.
the cia doesn't have a monopoly on seduction.
I play all the same games that you do,
except I play 'em better.
and with more style.
but I get it.
you want more balanced coverage,
and I want my sources left alone.
so I'll agree to let a little light in,
great meeting.
Oh, she's good.
I wish she was working for us.
I would have thought that after four years of being your teacher, you'd at least call me mark.
how have you been? - Good.
traveling, mostly.
your russian is still very sharp.
we were disappointed you passed up on that grant at the marin institute.
but you're here now. - I'm here now.
I'm dating a guy - a russian guy from moscow.
boy, be careful of those muscovites. They're worse than the italians.
he calls me kiisu, like a pet name.
I've never heard that word before, have you?
Annie, please, don't do this. - I really like this guy.
I just wanna make sure his story checks out.
please do not work for the cia.
I'm-I'm not.
don't insult my intelligence, and I won't insult yours.
working for these people will lead to nothing good.
I've had a lot of gifted language students,
but you were in a class by yourself.
the cia's just going to exploit that.
but I'm not.
I'm just dating this guy, and I thought you could help.
so that's your story.
what does kiisu mean?
it means...Kitten.
but not in russian. It's estonian.
and it's not even the most common way to say kitten.
really.
it's only used in the small villages in the south
near latvia.
so somebody from moscow would never use that word.
someone lying about coming from moscow might.
thank you. I gotta go.
be careful.
involving civilians in cia matters is a serious breach of protocol.
how did you know? - How do we know?
we know because we've been following you.
given the leaks we've had recently, We're following everybody.
stas is still out there. - Stas is dead.
it doesn't add up - the bad intel,
the way he was hitting on me, the fact that he stood near a window...
is that all?
and I was followed home last night
high-speed tactical pursuit. - I know.
that could have been the fbi, an unstable ex-boyfriend.
could have been us. - Was it you?
no. - I knew it.
Annie, this is all circumstantial.
get off the grassy knoll.
stas was born and raised in moscow.
the guy I met with used the word kiisu.
it's an estonian word. No russian would ever say that.
did you discuss this with your professor?
Yes.
gather your things. Go back to the farm.
at this point, you're gonna be lucky If you get a desk job in hr.
you may have been washed out of the entire program.
dismissed.
dismissed!
Whoops! Perfume.
wrong bathroom.
Jo malone. Grapefruit.
Annie! You're here? I had no idea.
liar.
how you doing?
I'm fine.
liar.
you know, I remember when I first started at the agency,
I was so freaking confused by everything.
and this is before my accident. I could still see, but...
the protocol, bureaucracy.
people I thought were mentors turned out to be jerks...
and vice versa.
I was a mess.
course, back then I could at least read the bathroom signs.
so what's the secret?
well...
I'm not sure there really is one secret.
but I find that it helps to keep a healthy sense of humor
and a bottle of patron in my desk drawer.
Annie, if joan was gonna fire you,
she would have already done it.
the agency likes people who take initiative.
it's kind of a weird push/pull thing.
in that case...
I need your help.
Hey, can you take a picture of us?
try and get the capitol building in the background
if you can.
- Thank you.
Thanks.
wintergreen listerine breath strips?
I'm improvising.
I once accidentally washed a pair of jeans with these in the pocket and when I fished them out,
I couldn't get them off my fingers.
this is never gonna work.
there's only one way to find out.
you know, when I was talking about initiative,
I meant like showing up for work early,
buying doughnuts for everyone once in a while.
we need to blend in. You need to sell this.
talking doesn't help!
we're clear.
Annie, you forgot my shoes.
I'm supposed to walk around the morgue barefoot?
I just need to find stas.
stas spent ten years in a siberian prison.
he has the tattoos to prove it.
and this guy...
clean as a boy scout.
I knew it.
stas is still alive.
I should have noticed it when his robe came off.
Wait-his robe came off?
Freeze! Fbi!
now, tell me...
what is a call girl...
doing at a d. C. morgue?
paying my respects.
so...
you're still telling me you're a call girl?
I'm still telling you I don't like that term.
okay. Who's the blind guy?
he's a client. - Client.
a john, as they say.
which is ironic, since my name is john.
okay. W-what were you two doing in the morgue?
I had mentioned to john about yesterday,
almost getting killed at the capital grand.
I knew he was a bit of a fetishist.
I thought it might turn him on.
seeing that dead body really turned me on.
yes...
you're blind.
what are you,"sight-ist"?
I think I'd like to speak to someone a little more open-minded.
there's one more thing you should know.
Really? And...
what is that?
we are extremely discreet.
we have a number of federal employees and civil servants on our client list.
I'm just putting that out there.
l - let me get this straight.
You're...propositioning me
during an interrogation?
see? You keep using all those clinical terms,
and it's dampening the mood.
I'll be back.
I just got a call from my boss's boss.
a man I've never talked to my entire career just called me.
Congratulations. You must be doing a good job.
a man I've never talke to told me to release you and your friend.
maybe your boss's boss is a gold circle client.
okay, here's what I think.
I think you both work for the agency.
I-I-uh... - No, I know, I know.
you don't know what I'm talking about, right?
I was gonna say you don't know what you're talking about.
okay. You work for the cia.
Yeah. You work for the cia,
and you should be sharing information with us anyway.
somehow you got involved with this russian guy
and instead of working with the bureau, decided to go it alone... only, you got caught.
and now some shadowy superior
who goes to the metropolitan club with our director
has gotta call to get you released.
the operative word being released.
so what did the nsa come up with?
well, they ran the wiretaps on miss calhoun from oversight.
And? - And, um...
it's all on the up-and-up.
all conversations with arthur are completely work-related.
it's actually pretty boring.
is that so?
you should be happy, joan.
your husband not having an affair.
Thanks, paul. I owe you one.
Yes, you do.
what is it, conrad?
heads up on tomorrow's front page.
how many sources does she have?
what else? You're hovering. - The dni called.
he wants to see you in his office First thing tomorrow.
thank you.
you were right. - Really?
don't make me say it twice.
we got a hold of the body after you two were pinched at the morgue.
not good, by the way.
we're sorry about that.
two days on the job, and you already have him apologizing for you?
she likes mingus. - I'm sorry.
later. We cross-checked dna samples.
it's not stas. - Who is it?
some patsy stas must have bribed to pretend to be him.
clearly, he omitted the "getting shot of it all.
and stas was the one doing the shooting?
he is an assassin.
why would he fake his own death?
not for the money. The transfer didn't go through.
wasn't to signal to us he was dead-too veiled.
we've overthinking it. Like you said - he's an assassin.
that means everything he does goes towards one goal.
Oh, man. Is stas still on the hstl?
let's see...
deceased.
if everybody thinks he's dead,
nobody's looking for him.
and if nobody's looking for him,
he can do what he really came here to do...
which is kill someone.
what's the threat matrix?
coming up.
president is abroad. Congress is out of session.
Petrov. An outspoken russian journalist visiting d. C.
it's classic fsb tactics.
half their assassinations go down abroad.
Petrov's at an awards dinner at the smithsonian right now.
we gotta get him out of there.
go get him, girls.
Petrov is secure. Stand down.
stas probably knew we were onto him and didn't show up.
Ethan. - Don't worry.
I'm not stalking you.
Petrov-he's a friend of the world bank, so...
sorry about last night,
you know, too much zin. Would you do me the hr of letting me pick up the dry cleaning bill?
it was only chocolate mousse.
you know, you smithsonian people really know how to throw a good party.
so are you, uh, working or are you playing?
working. Actually, could you excuse me for a second?
uh, work stuff. - Right.
move, and I'll kill you.
I believe you, stas.
let's think this through. The cia loves to negotiate.
I - I could shepherd you into langley myself.
keep walking.
I knew that spanish accent was off.
you're getting sloppy.
I promise you I'll work on that after you're dead.
get down on your knees.
the intelligence commendation award...
for your work on neutralizing an enemy spy.
thank you.
I look forward to coming back to the agency after I finish my training.
Oh, you're not going back to the farm.
we're gonna be keeping you here at the d. P.D.
your country needs you.
thank you.
Joan, can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah, of course. - On the platform...
it all happened so fast, but...
I could have sworn that stas was killed by...
somebody I knew.
someone you knew. - Someone I met while traveling.
Annie, you've been through a lot.
the man who killed stas is agent baldwin over there.
you're lucky he got there when he did.
you might wanna go thank him.
and you're gonna have to give that back.
awards stay here in the vault.
the agency giveth, and the agency taketh away.
you were right.
this is a weird place to work.
come on, let's go scarf down a few more of these cheese cubes before they take those away.
so you're telling me he's back again?
the moment we brought her in, he resurfaced.
thankfully, he took out stas for us.
they must have had a hell of a time in sri lanka.
should we mobilize an ops team?
no, not yet.
if we move too quickly, he could slip away again.
keep the girl working. Keep her out there. Let's see what he does.
hopefully, she'll lead us right to him.
this meeting's over, joan.
are you okay?
I'm fine. Stapler accident.
I'm such a klutz.
I'm sorry about this morning. - No, I'm sorry.
it's just that I wanted to introduce you to someone cool, and ethan was...
not.
it's okay.
he said he'd pay for the dry cleaning.
straight to the cherry garcia.
rough day, huh?
no. I'm fine.
you're such a horrible liar!
you'd make like the worst spy ever.
wanna talk about it?
not tonight.
move, and I'll kill you.
cereal is breakfast.
popsicles are not breakfast.
I'm not getting in the middle of that.
michael and I are doing this will thing, and I need you to sign.
sign what?
just this document saying that you'll be the girls' guardian, if something happens to both Michael and me.
Oh, can I ... can I think about it?
think about what? It's a no-brainer.
um, it's just that I'm late for work, and the Smithsonian is surprisingly strict.
I'm Annie Walker.
Annie? - I got to change perfumes.
it's the sound of your heels - very distinctive.
give me a hand?
Thanks.
Mingus box set, headphones - You're not quitting, are you?
don't get your hopes up.
the entire D.P.D. Is moving Into a brand-new, state-of-the-art, "welcome to the 21st century ten years too late" facility.
day? I didn't get the memo.
well, that's because you weren't here three years ago
when they actually did send out a memo，saying that we were moving in a week - Battle of bureaucracy.
my sister wants to make me her kids' guardian What's the CIA policy on that?
uh, don't ask. Don't tell your family you're on a mission in Colombia.
nice, huh?
finally, a space with windows... Or so I'm told.
Annie... Just the person I was looking for.
I have an assignment for you.
we need you to debrief the walk-ins.
sure.
what are walk-ins?
people who come directly to our headquarters claiming to have intel.
we need you to debrief them, in case any of it is actionable.
Parker in security will set you up.
walk-ins are nut jobs, right?
crackpot city.
we'll bring in the walk-ins one at a time. Debrief them; write a report.
anything actionable - come and see me.
there's a red panic button under the desk.
use it if you feel at all threatened, and the SPOs will handle it.
and here.
pepper spray?
welcome to walk-in duty.
and what can the CIA do for you?
in 1983, Castro and Reagan have a secret meeting in Cyprus...
where they lay down plans for controlling the world's sugar supply.
I only use sweet'n low.
no cubes.
and don't even get me started on stir sticks.
I know who killed Kennedy.
it's been well-documented that Kennedy was killed by Lee Harvey Oswald.
Ted Kennedy.
bless you.
I'm here on behalf of my son.
have you heard of numbers stations?
shortwave radio transmissions, right?
Walter told me that, uh, he decoded a message.
how?
numbers stations are essentially unbreakable.
he's studying computer science in college.
and he used his computer to help decipher the message.
Walter said that the clue led him to a mail boxes, etc.
in Rockville, and, um, he saw a man take a secret coded message out of the P.O. Box.
a, uh, blue airmail envelope.
could have just been the mail.
look, I know this sounds crazy,
but, um, Walter claims that the man saw him, and now he's really scared.
what type of code was it?
I - I don't know.
can you come out to the parking lot with me?
this is my son Walter.
the one in college?
I told you he was smart.
Hi, Walter.
are you a CIA operative?
Yes.
which of the four directorates are you in?
that's classified.
Yeah, I figured you might say that.
what are you reading?
it's a spy novel called the Parsifal Mosaic.
it's pretty much my favorite.
so have you come to check in on my numbers station?
I'm gonna try, but I need the specs first.
the numbers station's still broadcasting new messages On this bandwidth.
you can listen to them.
do you have any recordings of previous broadcasts?
Walter didn't want to bring s tapes into Langley.
my son is very scared. He isn't sleeping.
if-if this turns out to be nothing. That's good, but peace of mind would mean a lot.
can you please look into this for us?
I'll see what I can do.
it's nice to meet you, Walter.
keep those files accessible.
Jai Wilcox. - Good morning, Joan.
it's a beautiful new op center. You should be proud.
I don't remember assigning anyone desks yet,
especially not to someone who doesn't work in my division.
I do now, Courtesy of the D.C.S.
so the D.C.S. decided my division needed a dose of CIA royalty.
Arthur didn't tell you about this?
I'm surprised. He's your husband.
what are you hoping to do here at the D.P.D. Jai?
consider me a utility infielder.
so you have a mediocre arm and can bat. 230 From either side of the plate?
I will support you in any way you need.
welcome aboard, jai.
classified?
you know you can trust me.
thank you. - Auggie?
what do you know about numbers stations?
I haven't thought about them in years. Neither has anyone else.
one of my walk-ins thinks he found one that's still active.
do you think you or your team could look into it for me?
Yeah, no problem.
you think you can look into this for me?
rookies do lunch runs, huh?
Ah, the food court here runs its course after about six months.
separate receipts, please - We're all on government salaries.
Ah, sandwich runs - I remember those halcyon days.
Jai Wilcox? - It's been too long, my friend.
when did we become friends?
Annie, meet Jai Wilcox, my friend.
Hi, Annie.
Jai is the embodiment of the man, and I mean that in a slightly pejorative way.
Yalie, works for Arthur Campbell,
and as if that weren't enough, his father is Henry Wilcox.
like the Henry Wilcox, the former head of Clandestine Service?
definitely. And let me just say that you are already making a name.
for yourself up on the seventh floor.
which begs the question, what is the seventh floor doing here on our floor?
I'm working here - Special liaison, new initiatives.
Joan's aware of this? - She is. She's thrilled.
Yeah, sounds like Joan
to be thrilled about an interloper being installed in her division.
it's nice meeting you, Annie.
nice to meet you.
good-looking guy, huh?
no.
don't forget the pickles.
14. 487 megahertz.
so they're still broadcasting?
squatter's rights.
they play these annoying songs over and over. So nobody can steal the bandwidth.
these numbers aren't random.
this is a complex cyclic permutation.
it's a sophisticated encryption.
and what could it mean?
it means... Annie's walk-in may have uncovered an active spy transmission.
Hello?
I have a Helen Newman calling.
put her through.
Hello?
Annie, I think Walter was right. We're being followed.
Helen, come back to Langley.
come back? It was when we left langley that we started being followed.
I need to protect Walter. I should never have exposed him to this.
Annie, do you have a contact number for that woman?
we think her son might be on to something.
I'm beginning to think that too.
there has been no further contact from Helen Newman since her last call.
police have put out missing persons, but so far, nothing.
the shortwave transmissions that Walter deciphered Emanated from Belfast,
so as a result, we've looped in our U.K. Desk.
these broadcasts and Walter's account of the dead drops sync up with recent movements
by members of the Irish Republican Army.
the I.R.A.? Really? Is this 1987?
despite the Belfast agreement, the I.R.A has been actively recruiting.
and perhaps planning new attacks possibly here on American soil.
we've been working the back channels with MI6,
and they feel that the signals were intended for a Michael Cahill.
Cahill is a former I.R.A Captain
who had a hand in the Bishopsgate bombings of 1993
and the attempt on Vauxhall cross in '94.
timing suggests something imminent.
both those attacks occurred during lent.
we're now 20 days in.
Cahill was sent to prison in '95 and was released six months ago.
supposedly a changed man, he decided to move to America
to be free of the politics of his former life.
how did we give this guy a visa?
can you enhance the image of his passport, please?
that's an I. C.E. Issue.
we need to focus on what's important here.
Auggie in the tech division will continue to monitor the numbers station broadcasts.
the U.K. Desk will interface with MI6 to track Cahill.
Annie Walker... We'll be sending you to miss Newman's apartment in Bethesda to see if you can find her, the son
or any recordings of the numbers station.
here's your protocol.
you'll meet your MI6 liaison at 5: 00.
interactions with foreign operatives need to be authenticated.
you didn't think we were sending you alone, did you?
no.
of course not.
that doesn't look like it belongs in the new D.P.D.
it doesn't even look like it belongs in the old D.P.D.
I assume you're talking about the machine and not my vest.
we pulled it out of the CIA museum downstairs.
it was used in the '60s to decipher Russian spy code during the cold war.
whoever's running this numbers station is pretty sharp.
if you type the word "nuclear" into an email, the NSA's all over it.
but this spy has gone analog in a digital world.
aren't there computers that can handle this sort of thing?
Yep, and they are cranking away on the most sophisticated modern codes as we speak.
but big bertha here could come in very handy
if our spy's using a more archaic sequencing.
good luck.
no, I don't need luck.
I need Walter's tapes.
general, we have a - a long history of covering each other's assets, so to speak.
a moment, please.
Joan, I'd like to introduce you To Teppo Koivu and Reijo Numenin of the Finnish intelligence service.
Joan Campbell, head of the D. P.D.
pleasure.
Arthur, may I have a word?
I was in a meeting.
finnish intelligence - are you serious?
do they even have spies?
did I miss couples therapy?
why is Jai Wilcox now a member of my staff?
I would have thought you would have wanted somebody of his caliber at the D.P.D.
you know, it's bad enough you put Annie in the field to draw out Ben Mercer,
but now you have someone spying on her?
no, it's not - that's not it at all.
then he's spying on me.
Oh, so this is couples therapy.
Joan, with Conrad gone, Jai's a key part of our transparency initiative.
please trust me.
next time a little heads-up would be great.
transparency between us would be nice too.
go to the market and follow your protocol exactly.
if it tells you to wear a polka-dot bikini, Wear a polka-dot bikini.
and good luck.
are you interested in honey?
these days, it's about all I eat.
I could recommend a good brand.
could you write it down?
my memory's not quite what it used to be.
I think we're good.
I should think so.
nice job.
James Elliot. A real pleasure.
I'm Annie.
can you believe the script in that protocol?
always so pedestrian and food-related,right?
actually, it's the first one I've ever done.
Oh, well, there's the difference Between CIA and MI6.
you're allowed at your age and experience out into the field.
MI6 is a lovely outfit, but it's ten years， before you're even allowed to stretch your legs outside Vauxhall cross.
now this dinosaur is outrageous.
it's encryption through obsolescence.
by the time the CIA has a technology vetted; it's already five years old.
I - it may not look cool, but it's secure.
or maybe British intelligence isn't quite as ponderous as I thought.
total encryption, less than four ounces.
now you're just showing off.
eyes on the road, love.
okay, so what's the plan?
yuppie couple visiting friends.
I love it. Economical and I don't need to scale any fire escapes.
could you hold the door?
honey, we forgot the chardonnay.
cisa - Italian, top of the line, Wafer tumblers, top and bottom.
Thanks.
there's a pop quiz later.
bring your #2 pencil and an apple for the teacher.
it's today's mail.
Helen and Walter didn't come back here.
student loan, orthodontist bill, Paycheck from Bethesda Nursing Service.
she really is a working mom.
Walter looks just like his dad.
le carre, Graham Greene - He has a thing for old spy novels.
Yeah, well, I respect that.
classic spy novels weren't about flash and gadgets.
they were more about the... The human element.
the life.
so that's what this job is, wearing a trench coat and smoking cigarettes near a lamppost?
trench coats, yes.
cigarettes, no.
I'm on the patch.
Congrats.
I'm halfway there.
this is a lot of equipment for a nurse's salary.
catalogued by date, time... shortwave channel.
it's meticulous.
the tapes end last week.
Walter must have taken the recordings of the numbers stations with him.
you check the boxes.
I'm gonna surveil the rest of the apartment.
nothing of interest in the kitchen, by the way.
no I.D.
there's a back exit through the kitchen. Come on.
wait a minute.
Bethesda police scanner has alerted all units.
shots fired at the address of helen newman.
average response time for Bethesda P.D.Is what, Six minutes?
why couldn't it have been in D.C? Their cops are so much slower.
your suit still looks great, love.
Hey, what's going on?
we heard a gunshot.
stop. A few questions first.
Hey, McElroy.
lieutenant wants you upstairs to look at the body.
I'll handle these two.
so according to your statement, You saw nothing, heard nothing,
and were just heading back to Langley, correct?
correct.
have a nice evening.
bloody mess back there.
Helen was right.
someone was really after them. It wasn't just one of Walter's spy fantasies.
they must be terrified.
one thing you can say about the I.R.A... They are dogged.
how do you stay calm... when you pull the trigger?
I'm not calm.
I'm focused.
you'll get there.
you know, those spy novels are right about one thing
the toll it all takes...the toll it takes on living a normal life... family.
is it worth it?
I wouldn't know.
I don't have much by the way of family.
good night, Annie.
good night.
so how's Jai working out?
honestly, I still have issues with the DCS installing him in my division without my permission.
the DCS doesn't need your permission.
he outranks you.
just at work.
may I take your order?
I'll have the salmon, please.
I'll have the bone-in rib eye, rare.
thank you.
what was that look?
when we first met and you were married,
we'd have these illicit dinners, and you'd order that.
then later during our courtship
we'd have these romantic dinners, and you'd order that.
and now we're doing this, whatever this is,
and you order the same thing.
the one constant in our lives seems to be how you order steak.
Oh, we work in a job where there's misdirection, double-talking, sometimes lies.
here's the truth.
I want this to work between us.
ignore that.
continue to stare into my eyes.
maybe you should answer it.
what if it's an invasion or something?
no.
then this phone would be ringing.
come in.
I didn't hear you come in last night.
we missed you at game night.
Yeah, I was, uh - I was tired.
well, the girls were wondering where you were.
about the will... I don't think I can do it.
well, you can do it. You just don't want to.
I don't need to be judged by you.
no, you just need to be nurtured, fed, entertained, and supported, but only on your terms.
that's not true.
clearly, you're either not ready or uninterested in taking care of anyone besides yourself.
I'm sorry I even asked.
you know,you can wail on that thing all day,But there's no beating the heavy bag.
isn't that the point?
not really.
what's going on?
my sister thinks I'm ungrateful because I won't sign her will.
I couldn't help a working mom and her son,
and apparently, I have a knack For losing hand-to-hand fights... despite my training.
other than that, I'm fine.
okay.
kind of threw a lot at me there.
let's see if we can't, uh, break it down one piece at a time.
come here and put your hands on my shoulders.
now, right from where you're standing, try to push.
okay, okay.
come in closer.
push again.
I love the instructors at the farm,
but the fight training they do there is basically useless.
fights are frantic and ugly, and they are won at very close range.
try the bag again.
this time stand right next to it and weave away when it swings.
good.
how do you know?
I'm assuming it's good.
ready? Go.
okay, show me again.
Oh, and then here?
Elbow-no, no, no.
come on. Watch. Go. Down.
Yes.
all the way around.
it's dirty, right?
that's the one.
two pieces are in play.
firstly, we've I. D. 'd the body of the courier.
he's I. R.A. And a former associate of Michael Cahill.
secondly, we've had reports that Michael Cahill's on the move.
Cahill just left Baltimore on the marc train Heading to D.C.
he'll be arriving at union station in less than an hour.
he has a reputation for not tolerating mistakes.
we assume he's coming in to clean up the courier's mess.
the joint task force of DHS and MI6 will detain him there.
that's all for now.
what?
Helen and Walter - what are we missing?
we've gone down this road.
the hard drive you took was corrupted by Walter before they left.
the cops have come up with nothing.
they found Helen's car parked in a long-term lot.
she's turned her cell phone off. They're off the grid.
I still think Walter's tapes are the key.
Annie... in intelligence gathering, as in life,
we all want to believe the roles we play are critical, but this is bigger than you now.
what if this doesn't end with Cahill and the courier?
what if Helen and Walter are still in danger?
are you pushing this because you think they're relevant to this case,
or is it because you feel bad that they've gone missing?
honestly? Both.
Where's the harm in letting her follow the thread?
follow protocol.
and don't get caught.
I can't control whether or not you've been placed in my division,
but decisions about my officers are always mine and always final.
I understand. - I'm not sure that you do.
but you will.
copy that.
Mr. Cahill...
please, come with us.
spruce knob cabins.
Hi, I'd like to speak to one of your guests.
a mother and son that just checked in.
they said they weren't taking any calls.
I'm sure they did.
this would go quicker if you said something.
seems like you filled in most of the blanks already.
what are you doing in D.C. Mr. Cahill?
came to see an old friend.
I'm gonna need a little more than that.
from where I'm sitting, there are just too many threads that lead back to you.
I've told my friends.
I've told my former enemies.
I'm a peaceful man.
I've moved on.
and you are either lying or telling the truth.
and it's your job to sit here, judge me, And decide.
no.
the truth will emerge.
we can't hide who we truly are.
I had a feeling you'd find us.
you were right, Walter, about everything
the numbers stations, the dead drop, the spy ring.
we really need your tapes.
it could be important.
listen to me, Walter.
every day the CIA is deluged with calls And satellite photos, transmissions, emails, Walk-ins, chatter.
we put you in the wrong column.
we're sorry.
I'm sorry.
but this isn't a spy novel.
this is real, and your tapes could make everything better.
I promise you'll be safe.
enjoying the great outdoors?
does the CIA issue mosquito repellent?
there's a bit of an echo.
this is the only place I get reception up here.
big bertha's gonna do her thing.
all you have to do is kick back and eat some s'mores.
Stu, you've been riding me all day about when we can start.
it's show time.
Yeah, go.
what's it like taking care of Walter?
it's wonderful.
he's got a very active mind, and I... I just try to be there.
when it comes to your family, you do whatever you have to do.
I mean, sometimes I think I'm being overly indulgent.
this time it turned out he was on to something.
that's when we reached out to everybody.
everybody?
you know, the CIA, the British embassy.
you contacted the British embassy?
Yeah, last week.
we spoke to their intelligence offices.
stay here.
Auggie, are you there?
stop.
Auggie, are you there? - Annie?
how far did we drill down on James Elliot?
he claimed MI6 had no file on Helen and Walter.
but Helen says they went over there to share their intel last week.
well, maybe he didn't get the file.
he's on the case.
reading the file would have been the first thing he did.
Plus, he's on the nicotine patch, and he said we're halfway there - 20 days into lent.
well, being a Catholic isn't a crime.
his file says he's Anglican.
I hear you, but that doesn't mean he's a double agent.
we need something concrete.
here's something concrete.
he's tracking my phone.
Annie, just get out of there. Go.
he's here. He's after Helen and Walter.
they're here.
search the cabin.
there's a crawl space under the cabin.
we need to get to it from right here.
I had a feeling something like this would happen.
go, go.
Walter's tapes were the key.
everything fell into place.
it was a plan for a car bomb outside a British bank in D.C.
and Elliot was a double for the I.R.A?
Yes. He set Cahill up.
he was the one who called him to D.C.
set the courier up as well.
Why?
and build your trust for him at the same time.
double agents have never been known for their morals.
Thanks.
I'll call you back.
what you said about being a spy and having a family...was that part of your cover, or did you mean it?
that's what you want to know?
does it even matter now?
it matters to me.
it was true.
it was the only true thing I told you.
Mr. Cahill...
I'm in the unfortunate position of having to apologize to you.
intelligence gathering is not perfect.
we made a mistake.
you're free to go.
I came here looking for a new life,
but it seems to me you can't ever escape the mistakes of your past.
so look forward.
that's all any of us can do.
so tell me about Annie Walker.
she's smart, intuitive.
well, the fact that Ben Mercer's gone underground means anything she can provide will be critical.
I want you to continue to get close to her.
how close?
as close as you need to.
Joan isn't exactly happy about the situation.
you let me worry about Joan.
Walter, thanks again for all your help.
it ended like the Azzuri matter.
and he ends up shaken, but alive.
alive and rewarded.
these headphones are for you.
keep in touch.
Reference-grade Grado.
only the best for you, kid.
thank you for reaching out.
I know Walter appreciates everything you've done for him.
I do too.
thank you.
you're an amazing aunt.
the girls love you more than anything.
and I don't need a piece of paper to prove that you'd be there for them.
I know you would.
I signed it 20 minutes ago.
if anything happens, I'll be here.
when it comes to family, you do... whatever you have to do.
you're sneaky. You had me go through the whole speech.
that's good.
that's convincing.
Oh, annie, you shouldn't have.
it's cold.
well, I had to deliver ten cups.
couldn't you deliver mine first? I thought we were friends.
which is why I can give you cold coffee and not worry about getting fired.
I have a present for you.
just came in.
video, text, camera, data storage, all freshly CIA encrypted.
trade you for your old one.
no complaints from me.
careful.
what is it? - I got a fast track here.
armed shipment bound for the U. S. Three surface-to-air missiles.
our johannesburg station believes they went out of Richards Bay last week.
hidden onboard a container ship, so they're gonna be here in the next 24 to 48 hours.
what ship?
we don't have it.
destination city?
we don't have that.
what do we have?
the shipper was Hasaan Waleed.
the bribes I had to make were, um, more expensive than I originally estimated.
we agreed on $100, 000.
not $150, 000.
I need $50, 000 more.
how about you?
is $100, 000 enough?
good.
I expect to be in the United States tomorrow.
we have SAMs coming into the U. S. We don't know the city.
the shipper is Hasaan Waleed, but we don't know where he is.
any more from jo'burg? - No.
security cameras at Richards Bay were conveniently shut down for four hours.
every boat in the port's log is accounted for, so clearly this is off the book.
and humint?
southern africa station's pretty thin these days.
this is a world-renowned arms dealer we're talking about.
and we can't get any bodies on him?
we could end-around with the Aivd in Amsterdam.
we might have an in.
all right.
I could use some support.
Kelting, you're with Jai.
anyone stateside?
rumors of some contacts with the sudanese expat community In new york, but that was five years ago.
and who's early in camp?
Kimmer, but he's new.
angle just transferred back from Khartoum.
who else have we got?
who else? - Nobody else ever had his connections.
all right, annie... Track down mcauley, see if he'll play ball.
you're new.
maybe you'll have a shot.
Hey, why did jones say I might have a shot because I'm new?
Mcauley is Christopher Mcauley.
he was a deep-cover officer for 15 years.
knew everyone important that had anything to do with east africa.
one of his old contacts might know something about hasaan's movements.
but Mcauley retired five years ago.
why do I feel like I'm still missing something?
well, when I say he retired, I mean he had a nervous breakdown, quit the CIA.
moved to middle-of-nowhere, Virginia, and hasn't contacted us once.
I can actually hear you frowning.
on a scale of none to a lot, how many people have tried to bring him in?
almost every senior person in that room.
so this is basically a fool's errand?
you could think of it more of a hazing ritual If it makes you feel better.
sorry. Busy day.
Thanks, fellas. - Yes, sir.
keeping the old man waiting, huh?
bit of a power play?
you're still in your raincoat, dad.
you just walked through the door yourself.
you caught me.
you know you actually have to put that on? Protocol.
there should be special badges for people who ran the place for ten years.
dad, they are dedicating the new ops center to you in two days.
you expect new badges too?
what makes you think I expect anything, son?
I'm just happy to be here.
Henry wilcox, love the new beard.
Arthur, good to see you.
been a long time since you invited me over.
well, not since your retirement party, I would think.
Henry Wilcox is here and he's talking to Arthur.
where? - Your 8: 00.
what the heck was that?
if anyone's going to be sucked in by his evil vortex, I'd prefer it be you.
Oh, thanks.
I'm nothing, if it is cautious.
got to love they're gonna dedicate our shiny new center to someone with a lot of dirt on his hands.
you sound like you're channeling Liza Hearne.
well, when you're the former dcs and your most notable stat is that you ran more dark ops than anyone since the cold war, there's gonna be some commentary.
Hey, you know the story about henry and jai's mom, right?
no.
well, she was his asset when he was stationed in india.
her cover was blown.
Henry married her.
they became the Romeo and Juliet of the agency.
that's romantic.
it was until he left her for a younger woman
and then it just became a cliche.
don't you think you're being a little harsh?
I'm being easy.
Remember,we are referring to the man
who is affectionately known by half the press As "the prince of darkness."
I'm assuming by the sudden silence And the stiletto in my shin, Jai has joined us.
my favorite was always " satan's little helper."
has such a nice ring to it, don't you think?
well... I'm off to do anything else.
what's your father doing here?
going over details of the dedication.
aka, making arthur's life As much of a hell as possible.
can I buy you a cup of coffee?
regale you with stories of henry the terrible?
I think I would need alcohol to hear those stories.
perfect. Allen's tavern after work.
are you asking me on a date?
trust me.
if I was asking you out on a date, You'd know it.
and our first date will not be at allen's tavern.
what makes you think we're gonna have a first date?
you're the one who brought up dating.
I just brought up drinks.
I have some work to do.
don't you have some work to do?
enjoy that ride out to mcauley's.
Holly Holden, down.
you want to get off my property?
Mr. Mcauley, my name is annie walker.
I'm from... - langley.
we need your help. Is there somewhere we could go and talk?
get off my property.
well, I have a flat tire.
well, then I hope you have a spare.
Joan, dutch intelligence came through.
the guard who works the entrance gate
at Richards Bay turned out to be hasaan's cousin-in-law.
well, now we know why they chose jo'burg.
they turned him.
he's family and we got to him?
money's thicker than blood.
according to our friendly snitch,
Hasaan arrived with the weapons before the shipyard opened.
when the sudanese left, they were short four men and three crates.
Hasaan was one of the missing men.
he's coming in with the weapons?
unless we can figure out which ship he's on,
we are gonna lose one of the world's most notorious arms dealers inside the United States.
you're ridgebacks.
you're not dobermans.
least I can turn two dogs.
Mr. Mcauley!
nice place.
I like the whole recluse-in-the-woods motif.
and your dogs are sweet.
I can't help you.
can't or won't?
both.
how'd you know I was from langley?
with that suit on, you got to either be from the CIA or you're out here trying to sell me insurance.
I'm guessing you're new.
they always send the newbies out here to try.
you're a little older, so... I'm assuming they brought you in
for your language skills instead of recruiting you Straight out of school.
we have a weapons shipment.
how nice for you.
this is important.
it's always important.
who taught you that?
whatever your personal feelings about the CIA, this is bigger.
it's a greater good.
you want me to tell you how many crimes
have been perpetrated in the name of the greater good?
who gets to decide what's greater? What's good?
you? Langley?
you feel that mud on your feet right now? That's the only kind of mud I like feeling.
I'll take a pass on the other kind.
what is the other kind?
ask henry wilcox.
take the end... Wrap it around the main line three times.
where did you learn about fly fishing?
summers in montana with my cousins.
I spent summers on a military base.
military brat?
when I finished school, I wanted to just pick a place and go there bcause I wanted to, not bcause my father got stationed there.
I wanted to make my own choices for once.
be the master of my own destiny.
that sounds pretty dumb.
no.
why are you here?
kind of for the same reasons.
Hello, my friend.
I- I-I did not expect to see you again so soon.
or ever... I would imagine.
what are you doing in my house?
where is... Hasaan waleed?
last chance.
where is...Hasaan waleed?
stop staring at him.
how do-- How do you know I'm staring?
because you haven't responded to any of my clever remarks since he walked in ten minutes ago.
now since when are you so interested In Henry Wilcox?
or is it Jai?
I'm shooting you a dirty look right now.
so do you think it was wise to come back from london at the personal request of Arthur Campbell?
why do you always feel the need to give me Career advice after the fact?
it isn't advice. It's criticism.
Mcauley said, "talk to Henry Wilcox."
Yes, but he meant it in a "go screw yourself" kind of way.
I'm gonna do it.
of course you are and I'm gonna sit here All alone by myself.
Ah, please. There will be a girl here before I cross the bar.
thought I'd take you up on your invitation from earlier.
Annie, um, this is my father henry wilcox.
dad, Annie Walker.
it's a real pleasure to meet you. - Miss walker.
what's your pleasure?
scotch.
you disapprove of me.
no, I don't. - Yes, you do. It's okay.
everyone disapproves of me, present company included.
you all think everything is black and white, good versus evil.
that's why you joined up, right?
take down the bad guys.
better than letting the bad guys win.
precisely.
and sometimes,to make that happen
you got to get in the mud.
we're all in the mud, miss walker... Even if we don't want to admit it.
sometimes we have to do things we don't want people to see.
if you can't live with that... Leave.
you think that's why people leave?
some.
but not if they made it past the first few years.
why do they leave after that?
money or love.
well, that's it?
Oh, there are a million different reasons, but, uh, almost all of them,
when you really get past the excuses and the anger...
people leave for money... Or love.
what are you doing here?
putting career advancement over my personal life.
Plus, she couldn't remember the name of the last book she read and even I have standards.
want to talk about it?
you may not know this about me, but I'm an excellent listener.
is that so? - It's in my file.
how do you feel about what we do?
I mean, I know that manipulating people for information is pretty much my job description, - But it always makes me feel... - Dirty?
tell me it's worth it.
tell me what "it" is and I'll tell you If it's worth it.
I read mcauley's file and based on what He said today, I might have something I can use.
worth it.
it'd be a huge get for you to bring somebody Like mcauley in.
we don't always get to have everything nice and shiny And clean, but we are talking about Keeping weapons out of the hands of terrorists here.
Henry wilcox said we're in the mud, all of us, whether we want to admit it or not.
does that bother you?
I'd like to know how dirty I'm gonna get.
you know, tenacity might get you points at work, but not with me.
I want to talk to you about vanessa sinclair.
everything about you screams "go away," But I think it's all an act.
you have those big dogs to scare people, but really they're just sweethearts.
you didn't train 'em to be vicious.
I bet this shotgun isn't even loaded.
okay, it is.
Vanessa Sinclair worked for Henry Wilcox's albion group.
most of their work was compartmented, so I'm guessing it was dark ops.
it doesn't say anything in your files.
just that you and she both met in Khartoum When you were young.
but every vacation you took for 20 years Was within 10 miles of where she was operating.
and the walworth county fair happens every summer In wisconsin.
Vanessa was from lake geneva, which is about... Five miles from the fairground.
she buy you that hat?
I know what it's like to hang on to a memory.
so that's how you knew how to tie The rapala knot yesterday.
did you love him?
the person who taught you how to do that?
very much.
Vanessa died in the sudan five years ago.
you left the agency soon after that.
did you love her?
very much.
you feel like the agency took her away.
but the agency didn't kill her.
the inquiry into her death resulted in a name: Hasaan waleed.
I know.
what does it matter?
he's coming to the states.
if you help us, if you talk to your old contacts, we might be able to find him.
if you don't want to do it for the greater good, Then do it for yourself.
for vanessa.
you think that's gonna bring me closure?
I don't know about that.
but...I know staying up here in the woods all alone Is not gonna solve anything.
you're good, annie walker.
you're good.
you're talented enough to go very far in this business...
and foolish enough to want to.
she got him.
she's good.
she reminds me of someone.
Oh, yeah? Yourself?
you.
two requests from mcauley.
he says he needs to go to new york to talk To his contact.
who is it?
still won't tell us.
once a spy, always a spy. Who you gonna send with him?
he says he won't go without walker.
I tried to convince him that devon would be better, but he's insistent.
so send her, but send Jai with her.
second request, says he needs 250k.
he hasn't talked to his asset in over three years,
but thinks if he has money to offer, he can make it work.
well, tell him to make $100, 000 work.
we're in a recession.
and track the money.
Oh, okay, you already thought of that.
how about dinner at 8: 00?
did you already think of that too?
Henry wilcox is here.
where? - At the front gate.
he's not on your schedule, but he said he needs to talk to you.
bet he wants to complain about where the podium's gonna be for the dedication.
play nice.
dinner at 8: 00.
if you're lucky.
get him in here and find out what he wants. I got a meeting.
no, you don't. - Yes, I do.
Hello, arthur.
sorry you kept me waiting.
I always liked this view.
what are you doing here, henry?
it has come to my attention
that one of the cases you're working on right now Involves hasaan waleed.
who told you that?
if you give hasaan to the FBI Instead of turning him,
he'll disappear into a long legal battle.
did Jai tell you?
Jai won't tell me what he had for breakfast.
you're not paying attention, Arthur.
we can use Hasaan, but not if he's behind bars.
what can I do, henry?
Hasaan is coming here. It's a federal takedown. It's the law.
and cut the crap.
you didn't drive all the way out here and sit with my secretary for an hour
so you could lecture me on the difference in our perspectives.
there are some stories it will do no one any good to have out in the open.
that's a lot of money.
exactly why we don't want it to go any place We can't find it.
Where's the tracker?
look at one of the bills.
there's a polycarbonate strip on every bill uncle sam issues.
to the world, the strips on these bills look Just like every other U. S.treasury note.
but instead?
these have an rfid strip in them. It's a radio signal.
because we have 1, 000 of them all close together, we get a strong signal, but there's nothing to find If anybody goes looking for a tracker.
basically it's a virtually undetectable bug.
when are you gonna start tracing it?
you're walking out of the DPD with $100, 000 In taxpayer money.
we're tracking it now.
you see him?
if I haven't told you who it is yet, what makes you think I'm gonna tell you now?
it was worth a shot.
your father's an asshole.
I'm a big believer in justice.
in my opinion, Henry Wilcox and hasaan Should both be in prison.
they can rot there together.
no argument?
not from me.
no, no, no, no. You stay here.
what?
Yeah, I'm not gonna risk you and secret agent man here Scaring away my contact.
that wasn't the plan. - Yeah, well, it is now.
take it or leave it.
this is absurd.
I'm not even sure who his contact is yet.
well, we're about to find out.
you were recording everything that went on in that market and christopher didn't notice?
whoever his contact is is on this video.
talk to me, Annie.
I'm sending you an encrypted video right now.
I have three possibilities for a sudanese national.
you think you can scare me up some I. D.S?
nicely done. We're on it.
you really think your father belongs in prison?
not really.
but I wasn't gonna pick a fight With our operative just then.
your father's quite a guy.
that's a tactful way to put it.
is that why you spent five years overseas and never did a rotation stateside?
have you been reading my file?
checking up on me?
a copy of it might have gone around the female operatives when you first showed up.
and what else did you find out?
your mother is a neurosurgeon from Mumbai and you're a junior national squash player.
you like lattes.
my coffee preference was in my file?
no.
baristas talk.
he still has the case.
five years is too long.
I didn't get anything.
well, what'd he say?
that he didn't trust me.
I'm sorry.
now excuse me.
too much coffee.
dead end here. We have the case. We're heading back.
didn't Christopher seem really calm?
shouldn't he have been more upset after all he said about justice
and how he felt about vanessa?
he's gone.
theories?
he stole the money himself. Just got paid and ran.
or he bought the information from his contact and cut us out of the loop.
either way, he played us.
you let him go in alone?
he's a trained orative, Joan.
he wouldn't go in any other way.
if his contact's the one who has the money,
maybe he sold christopher information we could use.
maybe he'll sell it again.
we're not gonna get another 100k.
maybe we don't have to.
they've stopped.
got a visual.
recognize him from the market.
his name is sadiq misa.
he owns the restaurant.
our FBI detail, he thinks it's a front.
money laundering.
GPS coming to your phone.
northwest corner of the building off the alley.
probably an office.
target seems unaware.
place is practically empty.
okay, you're a go for recon and recovery,
but please try to get in and out without incident.
remind me to call you next time I'm locked out of my house.
has some cracks in the brick here.
Sadiq's been multitasking.
what?
we'd like to know exactly what you told the man in the market and you can keep this very handsome bag.
just give us the information, Sadiq.
we'll walk right out of here.
maybe make a quick call. Tip off the dea.
so the NSC Andromeda Docks at the brooklyn shipyard An hour from now.
I've got an FBI task force standing by.
all I need is your go ahead.
what?
we'll do this takedown, but without the feds.
get a special ops team set up.
Arthur, we can't do that. It's outside of our jurisdiction.
the FBI are ready to go. They're just waiting for a location.
they don't get that from us.
I cleared this with the director of national intelligence.
the only people who'll be at this takedown are our people.
what's going on?
just set up the ops team.
understood.
our orders are to head back to virginia.
what about Mcauley?
if christopher finds hasaan, he's gonna try and kill him.
what are you doing? - I'm going to the shipyard.
christopher wouldn't be in this mess If it weren't for me.
you're not responsible for him.
you can go to Langley if you want.
I'm going to Brooklyn.
do we have eyes?
just ears. Shipyard's cctv is locked off.
can't give us the coverage we need.
I got a report of unidentified persons on the scene.
description sounds like Annie and Jai.
what are they doing there?
team leader says there's a third and he's armed.
that must be mcauley.
I suggest you go away, Annie.
you played me.
like you played me.
I mean, wasn't this your idea?
vengeance for Vanessa.
my idea was for justice.
Oh, really? Justice for whom?
this isn't your fight.
the FBI is coming.
they will take him down.
Hasaan will be behind bars forever.
that'll never happen, honey.
Hasaan's not who you think he is.
he's an arms dealer.
who got his start with CIA funding And CIA weapons,
who killed one of our own when she went to work for him.
Vanessa. - Yeah.
she went to bring him weapons and money.
but he killed her.
and we-- we kept working with him Until he turned on us.
Annie, they don't want to arrest him.
they want to turn him back and leave him out there.
activity on the ship.
okay, we've got a positive I. D.Of Hasaan.
tell them to move in quietly. We need him alive.
team lead, move in.
keep it down. Keep him alive.
I'm gonna move.
we won't have your back.
don't do this.
thank you.
shot fired.
Hasaan's down.
the order was to take him alive.
who fired?
why don't I have an answer yet?
who fired that shot?
team lead, I need an answer now.
u. S.Made. The same weapons we sold to him.
how are you feeling about standing in the mud now?
we owe an incalculable debt to those that have gone before us
and we're proud to stand on their shoulders and usher in a new era.
one that is marked with a new sense of transparency, openness, honesty,
and the successful gathering of intelligence to help protect this great nation.
I'm pleased to dedicate this new ops center to my friend And predecessor Henry Wilcox.
congratulations, Henry. - Thank you, sir.
she sighs.
what's wrong?
mission accomplished.
greater good wins out again.
I'm proud to follow in my father's footsteps.
keep that family legacy of service here at the CIA intact.
what a blowhard. He's as bad as his father.
no, he isn't.
you're defending him?
I think he's just trying to figure this place out like the rest of us.
you knew the weapons were ours, didn't you?
that's why you had me cut the FBI out of the loop.
and don't tell me it's need-to-know...
because if you want this relationship to continue, Trust me...You need me to know.
Hasaan used to be an asset.
he was feeding us information in exchange For money and supplies.
he and his bosses built their entire operation with CIA funding and support, then he turned on us.
we sent an operative, Vanessa Sinclair, to deliver a shipment of arms.
he killed her, then used the weapons that we'd given him to build a terror cell.
and you knew this?
Oh, not till Henry Wilcox sat in my office and told me.
if hasaan had been arrested by the feds and all this came to light,
can't you just see the headlines? CIA arms terrorist cell.
but that was Henry, not you.
Oh, I never would have survived if this had gotten out.
I was here when henry started the op.
so were you.
I understand.
this didn't end the way I wanted it to.
I wanted hasaan behind bars.
but Ben Mercer didn't.
Oh, Annie, you shouldn't have.
I graduated from lunch duty to coffee runs.
it's cold.
well, I had to deliver ten cups.
couldn't you deliver mine first? I thought we were friends.
which is why I can give you cold coffee and not worry about getting fired.
I have a present for you.
just came in.
video, text, camera, data storage, all freshly CIA encrypted.
trade you for your old one.
no complaints from me.
careful.
what is it? - I got a fast track here.
armed shipment bound for the U. S. Three surface-to-air missiles.
our Johannesburg Station believes they went out of Richards Bay last week.
hidden onboard a container ship, so they're gonna be here in the next 24 to 48 hours.
what ship?
we don't have it.
destination city?
we don't have that.
what do we have?
the shipper was Hasaan Waleed.
the bribes I had to make were, um, more expensive than I originally estimated.
we agreed on $100, 000.
not $150, 000.
I need $50, 000 more.
how about you?
is $100, 000 enough?
good.
I expect to be in the United States tomorrow.
we have SAMs coming into the U. S. We don't know the city.
the shipper is Hasaan Waleed, but we don't know where he is.
any more from jo'burg? - No.
security cameras at Richards Bay were conveniently shut down for four hours.
every boat in the port's log is accounted for, so clearly this is off the book.
and humint?
southern Africa station's pretty thin these days.
this is a world-renowned arms dealer we're talking about.
and we can't get any bodies on him?
we could end-around with the aivd in Amsterdam.
we might have an in.
all right.
I could use some support.
Kelting, you're with Jai.
anyone stateside?
rumors of some contacts with the Sudanese expat community In New York, but that was five years ago.
and who's early in camp?
Kimmer, but he's new.
angle just transferred back from Khartoum.
who else have we got?
who else? - Nobody else ever had his connections.
all right, Annie... Track down Mcauley, see if he'll play ball.
you're new.
maybe you'll have a shot.
Hey, why did Jones say I might have a shot because I'm new?
Mcauley is Christopher Mcauley.
he was a deep-cover officer for 15 years.
knew everyone important that had anything to do with East Africa.
one of his old contacts might know something about Hasaan's movements.
but Mcauley retired five years ago.
why do I feel like I'm still missing something?
well, when I say he retired, I mean he had a nervous breakdown, quit the CIA.
moved to middle-of-nowhere, Virginia, and hasn't contacted us once.
I can actually hear you frowning.
on a scale of none to a lot, how many people have tried to bring him in?
almost every senior person in that room.
so this is basically a fool's errand?
you could think of it more of a hazing ritual If it makes you feel better.
sorry. Busy day.
Thanks, fellas. - Yes, sir.
keeping the old man waiting, huh?
bit of a power play?
you're still in your raincoat, dad.
you just walked through the door yourself.
you caught me.
you know you actually have to put that on? Protocol.
there should be special badges for people who ran the place for ten years.
dad, they are dedicating the new ops center to you in two days.
you expect new badges too?
what makes you think I expect anything, son?
I'm just happy to be here.
Henry Wilcox, love the new beard.
Arthur, good to see you.
been a long time since you invited me over.
well, not since your retirement party, I would think.
Henry Wilcox is here and he's talking to Arthur.
where? - Your 8: 00.
what the heck was that?
if anyone's going to be sucked in by his evil vortex, I'd prefer it be you.
Oh, thanks.
I'm nothing.
got to love they're gonna dedicate our shiny new center to someone with a lot of dirt on his hands.
you sound like you're channeling Liza Hearne.
well, when you're the former DCS and your most notable stat is that you ran more dark ops than anyone since the cold war, there's gonna be some commentary.
Hey, you know the story about Henry and Jai's mom, right?
no.
well, she was his asset when he was stationed in India.
her cover was blown.
Henry married her.
they became the Romeo and Juliet of the agency.
that's romantic.
it was until he left her for a younger woman
and then it just became a cliche.
don't you think you're being a little harsh?
I'm being easy.
Remember,we are referring to the man
who is affectionately known by half the press As "the prince of darkness."
I'm assuming by the sudden silence And the stiletto in my shin, Jai has joined us.
my favorite was always "Satan's little helper."
has such a nice ring to it, don't you think?
well... I'm off to do anything else.
what's your father doing here?
going over details of the dedication.
aka, making Arthur's life As much of a hell as possible.
can I buy you a cup of coffee?
regale you with stories of Henry the terrible?
I think I would need alcohol to hear those stories.
perfect. Allen's tavern after work.
are you asking me on a date?
trust me.
if I was asking you out on a date, You'd know it.
and our first date will not be at Allen's tavern.
what makes you think we're gonna have a first date?
you're the one who brought up dating.
I just brought up drinks.
I have some work to do.
don't you have some work to do?
enjoy that ride out to Mcauley's.
Holly Holden, down.
you want to get off my property?
Mr. Mcauley, my name is Annie Walker.
I'm from... - Langley.
we need your help. Is there somewhere we could go and talk?
get off my property.
well, I have a flat tire.
well, then I hope you have a spare.
Joan, dutch intelligence came through.
the guard who works the entrance gate
at Richards Bay turned out to be Hasaan's cousin-in-law.
well, now we know why they chose jo'burg.
they turned him.
he's family and we got to him?
money's thicker than blood.
according to our friendly snitch,
Hasaan arrived with the weapons before the shipyard opened.
when the Sudanese left, they were short Four men and three crates.
Hasaan was one of the missing men.
he's coming in with the weapons?
unless we can figure out which ship he's on,
we are gonna lose one of the world's most notorious arms dealers inside the United States.
you're ridgebacks.
you're not dobermans.
least I can turn two dogs.
Mr. Mcauley!
nice place.
I like the whole recluse-in-the-woods motif.
and your dogs are sweet.
I can't help you.
can't or won't?
both.
how'd you know I was from Langley?
with that suit on, you got to either be from the CIA or you're out here trying to sell me insurance.
I'm guessing you're new.
they always send the newbies out here to try.
you're a little older, so... I'm assuming they brought you in
for your language skills instead of recruiting you Straight out of school.
we have a weapons shipment.
how nice for you.
this is important.
it's always important.
who taught you that?
whatever your personal feelings about the CIA, this is bigger.
it's a greater good.
you want me to tell you how many crimes
have been perpetrated in the name of the greater good?
who gets to decide what's greater? What's good?
you? Langley?
you feel that mud on your feet right now? That's the only kind of mud I like feeling.
I'll take a pass on the other kind.
what is the other kind?
ask Henry Wilcox.
take the end... Wrap it around the main line three times.
where did you learn about fly fishing?
summers in Montana with my cousins.
I spent summers on a military base.
military brat?
when I finished school, I wanted to just pick a place and go there because I wanted to, not because my father got stationed there.
I wanted to make my own choices for once.
be the master of my own destiny.
that sounds pretty dumb.
no.
why are you here?
kind of for the same reasons.
Hello, my friend.
I- I-I did not expect to see you again so soon.
or ever... I would imagine.
what are you doing in my house?
where is... Hasaan Waleed?
last chance.
where is...Hasaan Waleed?
stop staring at him.
how do-- How do you know I'm staring?
because you haven't responded to any of my clever remarks since he walked in ten minutes ago.
now since when are you so interested In Henry Wilcox?
or is it Jai?
I'm shooting you a dirty look right now.
so do you think it was wise to come back from London at the personal request of Arthur Campbell?
why do you always feel the need to give me Career advice after the fact?
it isn't advice. It's criticism.
Mcauley said, "talk to Henry Wilcox."
Yes, but he meant it in a "go screw yourself" kind of way.
I'm gonna do it.
of course you are and I'm gonna sit here All alone by myself.
Ah, please. There will be a girl here before I cross the bar.
thought I'd take you up On your invitation from earlier.
Annie, um, this is my father Henry Wilcox.
dad, Annie Walker.
it's a real pleasure to meet you. - Miss walker.
what's your pleasure?
scotch.
you disapprove of me.
no, I don't. - Yes, you do. It's okay.
everyone disapproves of me, present company included.
you all think everything is black and white, good versus evil.

we're all in the mud, miss walker... Even if we don't want to admit it.
sometimes we have to do things we don't want people to see.
if you can't live with that... Leave.
you think that's why people leave?
some.
but not if they made it past the first few years.
why do they leave after that?
money or love.
well, that's it?
Oh, there are a million different reasons, but, uh, almost all of them,
when you really get past the excuses And the anger...
people leave for money... Or love.
what are you doing here?
putting career advancement over my personal life.
Plus, she couldn't remember the name Of the last book she read and even I have standards.
want to talk about it?
you may not know this about me, but I'm an excellent listener.
is that so? - It's in my file.
how do you feel about what we do?
I mean, I know that manipulating people for information is pretty much my job description, - But it always makes me feel... - Dirty?
tell me it's worth it.
tell me what "it" is and I'll tell you If it's worth it.
I read Mcauley's file and based on what He said today, I might have something I can use.
worth it.
it'd be a huge get for you to bring somebody Like Mcauley in.
we don't always get to have everything nice and shiny And clean, but we are talking about Keeping weapons out of the hands of terrorists here.
Henry Wilcox said we're in the mud, all of us, whether we want to admit it or not.
does that bother you?
I'd like to know how dirty I'm gonna get.
you know, tenacity might get you points at work, But not with me.
I want to talk to you about Vanessa Sinclair.
everything about you screams "go away," But I think it's all an act.
you have those big dogs to scare people, But really they're just sweethearts.
you didn't train 'em to be vicious.
I bet this shotgun isn't even loaded.
okay, it is.
Vanessa Sinclair worked for Henry Wilcox's Albion Group.
most of their work was compartmented, so I'm guessing it was dark ops.
it doesn't say anything in your files.
just that you and she both met in Khartoum When you were young.
but every vacation you took for 20 years Was within 10 miles of where she was operating.
and the Walworth county fair happens every summer in Wisconsin.
Vanessa was from Lake Geneva, which is about... Five miles from the fairground.
she buy you that hat?
I know what it's like to hang on to a memory.
so that's how you knew how to tie The rapala knot yesterday.
did you love him?
the person who taught you how to do that?
very much.
Vanessa died in the sudan five years ago.
you left the agency soon after that.
did you love her?
very much.
you feel like the agency took her away.
but the agency didn't kill her.
the inquiry into her death resulted in a name: Hasaan Waleed.
I know.
what does it matter?
he's coming to the states.
if you help us, if you talk to your old contacts, We might be able to find him.
if you don't want to do it for the greater good, Then do it for yourself.
for Vanessa.
you think that's gonna bring me closure?
I don't know about that.
but...I know staying up here in the woods all alone Is not gonna solve anything.
you're good, Annie Walker.
you're good.
you're talented enough to go very far in this business...
and foolish enough to want to.
she got him.
she's good.
she reminds me of someone.
Oh, yeah? Yourself?
you.
two requests from Mcauley.
he says he needs to go to New York to talk To his contact.
who is it?
still won't tell us.
once a spy, always a spy. Who you gonna send with him?
he says he won't go without walker.
I tried to convince him that Devon would be better, but he's insistent.
so send her, but send Jai with her.
second request, says he needs 250k.
he hasn't talked to his asset in over three years,
but thinks if he has money to offer, he can make it work.
well, tell him to make $100, 000 work.
we're in a recession.
and track the money.
Oh, okay, you already thought of that.
how about dinner at 8: 00?
did you already think of that too?
Henry Wilcox is here.
where? - At the front gate.
he's not on your schedule, but he said He needs to talk to you.
bet he wants to complain about where the podium's gonna be for the dedication.
play nice.
dinner at 8: 00.
if you're lucky.
get him in here and find out what he wants. I got a meeting.
no, you don't. - Yes, I do.
Hello, Arthur.
sorry you kept me waiting.
I always liked this view.
what are you doing here, Henry?
it has come to my attention
that one of the cases you're working on right now Involves Hasaan Waleed.
who told you that?
if you give Hasaan to the FBI Instead of turning him,
he'll disappear into a long legal battle.
did Jai tell you?
Jai won't tell me what he had for breakfast.
you're not paying attention, Arthur.
we can use Hasaan, but not if he's behind bars.
what can I do, Henry?
Hasaan is coming here. It's a federal takedown. It's the law.
and cut the crap.
you didn't drive all the way out here and sit with my secretary for an hour
so you could lecture me on the difference In our perspectives.
there are some stories it will do no one any good to have out in the open.
that's a lot of money.
exactly why we don't want it to go any place we can't find it.
Where's the tracker?
look at one of the bills.
there's a polycarbonate strip on every bill Uncle Sam issues.
to the world, the strips on these bills look Just like every other U. S.treasury note.
but instead?
these have an RFID strip in them. It's a radio signal.
because we have 1, 000 of them all close together, We get a strong signal, but there's nothing to find If anybody goes looking for a tracker.
basically it's a virtually undetectable bug.
when are you gonna start tracing it?
you're walking out of the DPD with $100, 000 in taxpayer money.
we're tracking it now.
you see him?
if I haven't told you who it is yet, what makes you think I'm gonna tell you now?
it was worth a shot.
your father's an asshole.
I'm a big believer in justice.
in my opinion, Henry Wilcox and Hasaan Should both be in prison.
they can rot there together.
no argument?
not from me.
no, no, no, no. You stay here.
what?
Yeah, I'm not gonna risk you and secret agent man here Scaring away my contact.
that wasn't the plan. - Yeah, well, it is now.
take it or leave it.
this is absurd.
I'm not even sure who his contact is yet.
well, we're about to find out.
you were recording everything that went on In that market and Christopher didn't notice?
whoever his contact is is on this video.
talk to me, Annie.
I'm sending you an encrypted video right now.
I have three possibilities for a Sudanese national.
you think you can scare me up some I. D.s?
nicely done. We're on it.
you really think your father belongs in prison?
not really.
but I wasn't gonna pick a fight With our operative just then.
your father's quite a guy.
that's a tactful way to put it.
is that why you spent five years overseas and never did a rotation stateside?
have you been reading my file?
checking up on me?
a copy of it might have gone around the female operatives when you first showed up.
and what else did you find out?
your mother is a neurosurgeon from Mumbai and you're a junior national squash player.
you like lattes.
my coffee preference was in my file?
no.
baristas talk.
he still has the case.
five years is too long.
I didn't get anything.
well, what'd he say?
that he didn't trust me.
I'm sorry.
now excuse me.
too much coffee.
dead end here. We have the case. We're heading back.
didn't Christopher seem really calm?
shouldn't he have been more upset after all he said about justice
and how he felt about Vanessa?
he's gone.
theories?
he stole the money himself. Just got paid and ran.
or he bought the information from his contact And cut us out of the loop.
either way, he played us.
you let him go in alone?
he's a trained operative, Joan.
he wouldn't go in any other way.
if his contact's the one who has the money,
maybe he sold Christopher information we could use.
maybe he'll sell it again.
we're not gonna get another 100k.
maybe we don't have to.
they've stopped.
got a visual.
recognize him from the market.
his name is Sadiq Misa.
he owns the restaurant.
our FBI detail, he thinks it's a front.
money laundering.
GPS coming to your phone.
northwest corner of the building off the alley.
probably an office.
target seems unaware.
place is practically empty.
okay, you're a go for recon and recovery,
but please try to get in and out without incident.
remind me to call you next time I'm locked out of my house.
has some cracks in the brick here.
Sadiq's been multitasking.
what?
we'd like to know exactly what you told the man in the market and you can keep this very handsome bag.
just give us the information, Sadiq.
we'll walk right out of here.
maybe make a quick call. Tip off the DEA.
so the NSC Andromeda docks at the Brooklyn Shipyard an hour from now.
I've got an FBI task force standing by.
all I need is your go ahead.
what?
we'll do this takedown, but without the feds.
get a special ops team set up.
Arthur, we can't do that. It's outside of our jurisdiction.
the FBI are ready to go. They're just waiting for a location.
they don't get that from us.
I cleared this with the director of national intelligence.
the only people who'll be at this takedown are our people.
what's going on?
just set up the ops team.
understood.
our orders are to head back to Virginia.
what about Mcauley?
if Christopher finds Hasaan, he's gonna try and kill him.
what are you doing? - I'm going to the shipyard.
christopher wouldn't be in this mess If it weren't for me.
you're not responsible for him.
you can go to Langley if you want.
I'm going to Brooklyn.
do we have eyes?
just ears. Shipyard's cctv is locked off.
can't give us the coverage we need.
I got a report of unidentified persons on the scene.
description sounds like Annie and Jai.
what are they doing there?
team leader says there's a third and he's armed.
that must be Mcauley.
I suggest you go away, Annie.
you played me.
like you played me.
I mean, wasn't this your idea?
vengeance for Vanessa.
my idea was for justice.
Oh, really? Justice for whom?
this isn't your fight.
the FBI is coming.
they will take him down.
Hasaan will be behind bars forever.
that'll never happen, honey.
Hasaan's not who you think he is.
he's an arms dealer.
who got his start with CIA funding And CIA weapons,
who killed one of our own when she went to work for him.
Vanessa. - Yeah.
she went to bring him weapons and money.
but he killed her.
and we-- we kept working with him Until he turned on us.
Annie, they don't want to arrest him.
they want to turn him back and leave him out there.
activity on the ship.
okay, we've got a positive I. D.of Hasaan.
tell them to move in quietly. We need him alive.
team lead, move in.
keep it down. Keep him alive.
I'm gonna move.
we won't have your back.
don't do this.
thank you.
shot fired.
Hasaan's down.
the order was to take him alive.
who fired?
why don't I have an answer yet?
who fired that shot?
team lead, I need an answer now.
u. S.Made. The same weapons we sold to him.
how are you feeling about standing in the mud now?
we owe an incalculable debt to those that have gone before us
and we're proud to stand on their shoulders and usher in a new era.
one that is marked with a new sense of transparency, openness, honesty,
and the successful gathering of intelligence to help protect this great nation.
I'm pleased to dedicate this new ops center to my friend And predecessor Henry Wilcox.
congratulations, Henry. - Thank you, sir.
she sighs.
what's wrong?
mission accomplished.
greater good wins out again.
I'm proud to follow in my father's footsteps.
keep that family legacy of service here at the CIA intact.
what a blowhard. He's as bad as his father.
no, he isn't.
you're defending him?
I think he's just trying to figure this place out like the rest of us.
you knew the weapons were ours, didn't you?
that's why you had me cut the FBI out of the loop.
and don't tell me it's need-to-know...
because if you want this relationship to continue, Trust me...You need me to know.
Hasaan used to be an asset.
he was feeding us information in exchange for money and supplies.
he and his bosses built their entire operation with CIA funding and support, then he turned on us.
we sent an operative, Vanessa Sinclair, to deliver a shipment of arms.
he killed her, then used the weapons that we'd given him to build a terror cell.
and you knew this?
Oh, not till Henry Wilcox sat in my office and told me.
if Hasaan had been arrested by the feds and all this came to light,
can't you just see the headlines? CIA arms terrorist cell.
but that was Henry, not you.
Oh, I never would have survived if this had gotten out.
I was here when Henry started the op.
so were you.
I understand.
this didn't end the way I wanted it to.
I wanted Hasaan behind bars.
but Ben Mercer didn't.
five mins - Yes all day.
dinner.
see You. - Bye.
we're not going to the Green Briar next week.
michael has to finish a policy paper and can't get away.
mommy, mommy, Chloe's teasing me!
I am not! She's teasing me, mommy!
didn't you need some time away from them?
Oh.Never.
I have to ask. -No, you don't.
when you picked up yesterday's outfit off the floor this morning,
did you think no one would notice?
no comment. - You're on the walk of shame.
you're holding my arm, so technically, it's our walk of shame.
although, it hardly seems fair you get the shame and no fun.
who is it?
that is so funny that you think I'm gonna tell you.
Hey. Conference room, guys.
Joan. The sound of your necklace gives you up.
I only like that trick when you do it to other people.
special activities division is en route to brief you.
this week, you belong to them, but we're goa let you operate out of here because...
not everyone has a braille keyboard and an embedded document reader with voice recognition?
because I know you like your desk arranged just so.
this drone is programmed to drop hellfire missiles on a meeting of all-star tribal leaders.
what's wrong with this picture?
no one was there. They knew we were coming.
this is the third mission in two weeks that has been compromised.
after the first, we shut down assets in Syria and Iraq...
to no avail. So it's happening on our side.
that was the theory. We also limited briefings to essential personnel in clandestine services.
mission details still got out. - Who could it be?
there's really only one possibility left. A United States senator.
more specifically, a member of the intelligence committee.
they have compartmented clearance higher than top secret.
only they have access to these missions.
I don't have to tell you all how big this is.
no member of the senate's been convicted for treason since 1797.
but how? The senate intelligence briefing room is secure.
no documents. Not even notes can be taken out.
well, that's where all of you come in.
each of you will use your undercover to gain access to a targeted senator.
Jai's running point on his.
okay. Read-in privileges. There are none.
this is completely off book.
if the senate knew we were spying on them in their own backyard,
we'd have another fisa situation.
why are we doing it?
because you're young and you're nobody.
you'll fit in perfectly on Capitol Hill.
who'd ya get? - Darton.
lame duck facing ethics charges. I like my chances.
I got Wallenberg.
isn't he the only one who opposed the war?
Oh, yeah. Who'd you get?
Gil jarvis. The committee chair.
he's not the leak. - Joan basically said that.
senator Jarvis's office. Please hold.
can I help you? - Annie walker.
I'm here from the Smithsonian to switch out the art.
as a courtesy every term, we make pieces available
to members of the museum's board of regents...
like the senator.
but you don't have an appointment.
my office should have called ahead-- can I see?
I was hostess at the palm in Miami for two summers.
well, who do I talk to?
you must be the Smithsonian gal.
I'm Gil Jarvis. Good to meet you.
Annie Walker. Thanks for making time for me, senator.
my pleasure. But you have to thank my lovely wife Madeline.
that's her lovely desk.
she's in charge of the way things look around here.
come with me. Now, you don't want to hang around too long.
she'll try to give you a makeover.
not that you need one.
please.
she did this room. There's no wet bar.
I just think Washington has had its fill of drunken senators.
finally, a woman who's interested In something more than politics.
the Smithsonian called about you this morning. Welcome.
thank you.
senator, they're ready for you.
Ashley, this is Annie Walker from the Smithsonian.
she's gonna be taking things down and puttin' stuff up.
Hi. Ashley briggs. Chief of staff.
Hi. I have that exact same sweater.
good taste.
Annie. How do we get our hands on Wyeth's whooping crane piece?
I think it would be a perfect vertical For the reception area.
teachers union and Pakistan.
I'll find out. Andrew Wyeth.
no. N.C. Wyeth. Not the other one.
I said the whooping crane piece.
Y- you do know the collection, don't you?
actually, we have nature paintings from both Wyeths in our collection,
but I will make sure that you get the right one.
what's after the meetin'?
I need to freshen you on Pakistan, and we can do the rundown
on the way to your 5: 00 p. m.intel briefing.
excellent. Ladies. We're on our way.
somethin' with animals.
you know, I just-- I just love animals. Yeah.
you treat them like eggs!
well, they're borrowed es.
I don't want to be the one to break 'em.
Hey, Jimmy. Frederico.
Yeah, we gotta make sure custodial hits Jarvis's goods tonight.
Yeah, we got plaster on the carpet.
Oh, right, it's Tuesday.
okay, well, tell him to hit it good in the morning then.
are you from Catarina?
you know Brazil?
Catarina's a tough place.
no. It's the best city.
everyone here thinks I'm Mexican.
they try to talk Spanish to me.
portugese is my favorite language.
Frederico, what happens in senator Jarvis's office on Tuesdays?
he worked late that night.
I know he has a 5: 00 p. m. briefing, But then what?
all they say is no noisy vacuum.
Oh. So you're not allowed in there at all.
no. But they clean his office two times, on Wednesday early in the morning,
and later time tonight.
CIA headquarters
you look perplexed.
Perplexed? - Puzzled. Confused.
in need of a drink with a coworker.
I can't.
Jarvis has a secret meeting in his office Tuesday nights
after the intel briefing.
I have to find out who's invited and what goes on.
and you think you're going to find an answer doodling...
curly, twirly thingies?
Pinwheels.
no. You're right.
I have to go back, don't I?
if you want answers, you have to dig.
remember, these senators aren't gods.
they wanna be liked and they wanna succeed.
they're fallible. Just like you and me.
just don't get caught.
it's a small painting, but it's priceless.
I probably just left it on his cart.
I'll be quick. - Nope. I'm not authorized.
if we wait till morning and it's gone,
Frederico and anyone who ever stamped his time card
is gonna be held accountable.
there.
I need a swipe card duplicated so I can return the original to its rightful owner.
Spencer in I. T. - Thanks.
Oh, whoa. 'scuse me, ma'am.
hard drives you needed, sir? - Oh, yeah, thank you.
can you put them on the table? - Yes, sir.
I'm playing catcher on operation goliath.
that's for that high-threat tribal leader. What's his name?
he's holed up on a compound on the Pak-Afghan border.
I'm dealing with incoming chatter and handling logistics.
right now I am bingeing on power drinks
because, with a ten-hour time difference,
I'm gonna be here all night.
you're oddly mesmerizing.
so the legend goes.
can I ask you a question about men?
way too general a question for me to sign off on.
do most men cheat on their spouses?
where are you going with this?
my brother-in-law said he was gonna be in the office all day,
and then I saw him walk out of a hotel this afternoon.
power nap? - I'm serious.
well, maybe he had a lunch there.
at 4: 00 p. M? - I
I'm looking for an August?
Yep, right here. You from S. A.D?
Yes, sir. I've got the landsat thematic mapping you requested.
Spencer in I. T.
no, I already have e landsat calculations.
I need NGA to send me aster data. Got it?
okay. I guess he's gone.
two more senators cleared. Pack is thinning.
now we know Jarvis isn't only corruptible but vulnerable.
little too vulnerable. Nice diggin'.
I did a little on my own.
Ashley's not his first, I take it.
not even his third.
he uses cash for most of the mistress upkeep, like jewelry and vacations.
but he can't seem to resist using membership cards to get points at the restaurants.
classy.
current squeeze ashley rowed all four years at colgate.
her bank statements show membership dues at the congressional rowing club.
I'll pay her a visit, do a little girl bonding.
Oh, remember. Jarvis holds the cia purse strings.
if you're wrong about ashley briggs, it's a misfire.
if you're wrong about jarvis, We'll be lucky to get funding for Commodore 64s.
good luck.
Thanks.
thanks for that.
Hey, auggie, man, We hear it's gridlock down there.
Yeah, we did a sweep at 07：00, And the marcbot four found an ied.
they're clearing it now.
visibility? - New moon.
satellite images show there won't be any cloud cover.
a clear pitch black night. Perfect.
welcome to my world.
Hey, uh... What else you got cookin'?
who's using my itunes account?
I told you he'd figure it out.
we may have downloaded a few tunes.
congressional rowing club
the smithsonian girl. With the sweater.
Annie Walker. Yeah.
well, you can't be rowing in sneakers.
no. I was running. Well, jogging.
actually, walk/jogging. It's a good workout.
well... This is the worst part of rowing, so...
Where's an unpaid intern when you need him?
right.
Thanks.
up here? - Yeah.
you wanna get some coffee? - Yeah, sure.
remember when mom used to put little notes in our lunches?
I never got a note.
awkward.
I guess she loved me more.
Hey, hey! No hitting, girls.
um, I'm gonna try to make it home for their bedtime, but, um...
I won't keep them up.
what's the paper he's working on?
a johns hopkins study about asthma.
he seems stressed. - Yeah, poor guy.
he has to work out of the Baltimore Campus,
which adds two hours to his commute every day.
so he's in Baltimore every day?
Yeah.
Auggie. I'm filing a request with the S. A.D.
to cancel your loan to them for operation goliath.
Why? - Because I need you.
what for?
well, I can't tell you until the S.A.D. gives you back.
don't take me off of goliath. - Why?
because I need to diversify And prove my value outside the dpd.
you don't care about inter-agency politics, and you don't need to
you've got this place wired.
Joan, goliath is personal.
they're guys from my old unit.
I didn't know that.
well, it'd mean a lot to me. - Yeah. Of course.
of course, Auggie. Good luck.
so I said,"Darling, it's like sitting on the beach " trying to count the grains of sand.
all you're gonna get accomplished is getting sunburn on your shoulders and sand up your bum.
I wish I could have been there.
wishing for something has nothing to do with getting it accomplished.
excuse me, Mrs. Jarvis, I was able to locate that painting you wanted.
Oh, thank you! But can I deal with it later?
much later. We have a double date to get ready for.
art can wait.
Tina, this is Tnnie. She's from the Smithsonian.
Mrs. Varma is the wife of the indonesian ambassador.
we were vandy girls, back in the day.
and we still are. Come on, Maddie.
Oh! So Annie, I'll see you tomorrow then?
Yes, ma'am, I will see you tomorrow morning.
Hello, Tina. - Ashley.
Madeline, darling, we're late for our luncheon. We're gonna lose our reservation.
I'm coming, I'm coming.
not a fan?
she is Madeline's one-woman support group.
I suppose I shouldn't resent it, But every time they go out,
the Florida taxpayers foot the bill.
tax dollars at work.
and guess who has to justify it on the expense report?
how 'bout we go rack up our own bill?
we'll have another beer.
Oh, and I'll have yet another margarita.
please. And hold the salt.
did you know this place was a hangout for spooks?
like CIA?
at least we'll know the guys are full of crap.
what is it about this town?
everybody here parties like they're still in college.
we need it. Our days are pressure-filled.
you got a lotta steam to let off.
you think Tina Varma and Madeline Jarvis are on their third round by now?
what?
Tina varma is a gold digger.
she married ambassador Varma Because when they go to indonesia for his home visits,
she gets treated like royalty,
and here she gets to live on other people's expense accounts.

Oh... - So romantic.
wait. He wants to come over now?
now. He's 25.
he expects me to go over there!
I just throw the young ones back.
I think senator Jarvis likes you.
w- why do you say that?
I don't know, it's just like... The way he looks at you.
it's nice, like he really respects you.
he probably wishes he wasn't married.
cone of silence? - Of course.
their marriage is not what it seems.
he told me.
he's lonely. - Well, I...I think he was.
lonely, I mean.
you are in love with him?
Oh, my
he is...Amazing.
he's so sweet, funny, and the most brilliant man I have ever met.
he's gonna leave her After the election.
when do you have time to get together?
every Tuesday night.
and Sunday afternoon, we have a sort of...Date.
that's the most washington thing I've ever heard.
you schedule your affair!
can we see a menu? Please?
and can we get like some chips and salsa? Thanks.
Ashley copped to the affair, and I think...
if she were the leak, She wouldn't breathe a word of it, right?
well, not necessarily. How drunk did you get her?
she got there all on her own. Hey, can you run a name for me?
Yeah. - Tina varma.
she's the wife of the indonesian ambassador.
maybe joan's right. Maybe senator jarvis is being blackmailed.
that's a big leap. And it requires indisputable proof.
indisputable. Got it.
I deeply regret that Ms. Briggs allegedly sold secrets to a foreign govenment.
I just emailed you a draft of a memo I found in madeline's desk.
she must have written it.
it's a resignation speech from the senator.
he says he's gonna quit because ashley sold our secrets.
Jai, the senator's not the leak. Ashley's not the leak.
his wife's the leak.
and she's gonna frame ashley for it.
is that indisputable enough for ya?
Annie, you just hooked a whale.
the White House wants to be read-in on this In real time, Joan.
how'd she do it? How'd she access this information?
you'll know when I know.
what's your game plan? Are you on top of all the
on top of a leak from the head of the senate intelligence committee?
for christ's sake, Marty. We're the head of this investigation.
I'm not doing this jurisdictional pissing match with you.
can we get some coffee? - Our people will tail madeline jarvis.
when she hands off more intel, We will discreetly bring her in.
then we will turn her.
she will work for us.
she will feed bogus traceable intel to her contacts, whoever they may be.
we're going to let her contacts walk away.
Marty, when you're in charge of an investigation,
you can say book 'em and round up whoever you want.
but right now, we're gonna follow this pipeline of information as far as we can,
so that when we do a takedown, we make sure we get everyone.
now, at 50 meters to the structure, You split into three teams
one at the southwest corner, one at the northwest corner,
and the other to the front.
and we suspended all flybys for those 20 minutes.
we have a convoy of backup vehicles in peshawar At the ready.
Hey, we are good to go, bro.
I'm ready to start chilling with my $62' worth of country music you bought me.
come on, man. Not even bluegrass?
straight up american country. Hoo!
later, bro. - yeah.
my brother-in-law is definitely lying to my sister.
how do you know?
he said he was gonna be in Baltimore all day,
then I saw him walk out of a hotel in D.C.
well, maybe she knows, and she's just looking the other way.
the woman who knows and looks the other way Is an urban myth.
what's up with you?
nothing.
you're... Usually funnier.
S.A.D. Wants nasir alive. That's the imperative based on the newest chatter.
he has a cell in turkey, And I'm stuck at a desk at the dpd
trying to help my guys pull off a pretty tricky mission.
you're gonna nail it.
you weren't on the call when they found out I was point man.
I heard the hesitation in their voices.
your sense of hearing is overdeveloped.
those guys love you like a brother,
and you are very, very good at your job.
since when did you start giving inspirational speeches?
since you went on loan to the S.A.D.
cabbie is en route to the capitol grill.
Yeah.
taxi.
taxi.
you're supposed to be chained to your desk an hour from here.
it's not what you think.
well, I wanna know what it really is, But not right now.
please. Don't say anything to danielle.
now, I know this has been hard on you, Maddie,
but you couldn't just sit on your hands.
trust me, we'll come through on our part.
good-bye, darling.
scuse me. I don't think my lunch date's gonna show.
I'm sorry for taking up the table.
Mrs. Jarvis? - Annie!
please, come, sit down.
did you just get here?
I haven't paid yet. I could get you something.
thank you. I won't be long.
is there a problem at the museum?
don't tell me we're not getting the Wyeth.
Mrs. Jarvis, I'm not... from the Smithsonian.
of course you are. - No. I'm afraid I'm not.
what are you talking about?
I need you to come with me to Langley.
Langley?
there are some people there who need to talk with you.
there's a car waiting out front.
I'm calling my attorney.
if you call your lawyer, this becomes a legal matter with public documents.
or we can handle it discreetly.
we're bringing in your husband now.
we need to know what you passed, Madeline-- all of it.
I have field agents and operatives Whose lives hang in the balance here,
not to mention ashley briggs, whose life
it wasn't my idea... To pin it on ashley.
was it Tina Varma's?
she said I needed to take my life back Into my own hands.
she told me no one would get hurt.
and you believed her.
I worked as a teacher to put Gil through law school.
we built his career together.
I stood by his side through the county elections And the state elections...
endless fundraisers and speeches.
all for the dream we had together. - Until he cheated on you.
he changed.
his priorities changed.
just for a moment, let's be two women...
who are married to powerful men, okay?
what your husband did to you is terrible.
but what is really crushing
is that pushing Ashley Briggs out of the way wouldn't solve anything.
because another woman would just come along.
and that's why you did it, isn't it?
because you wanted to hurt him irreparably.
you wanted to kill his career.
I just wanted him To come back home with us to gainesville.
I wanted it to be like it was when we first got married.
that's not a marriage. That's a honeymoon.
Ashley was the last mistress Madeline jarvis was willing to tolerate.
now you have to tell ashley to take the fall.
excuse me?
the Indonesians need to believe that their plan is up and running.
that way we can use madeline to feed false information And trace where it goes.
Ashley has to be taken into custody for espionage, Annie.
we're gonna give her a new life.
all she did was get involved with the wrong guy.
who was married. Who was her boss.
think of her as a cautionary tale.
workplace romances always complicate it, Annie, no matter how common it is.
we are go/no go fellas. Stay frosty.
I have to tell a perfectly nice girl That one bad romance has ruined her name.
your sister? - No.
but I like where your head's at.
Oh, uh, I would love to hear about your mission, but not today
Goliath's in position.
yeah? - Yeah!
today, Annie w\Walker, I am a...Closer.
Thanks. - For what?
you're all fired up when those guys are depending on you to be.
so what are you thanking me for?
for inspiring me to look at the bigger picture.
Ashley? - Hey, Annie.
we need to talk.
tell me none of this is happenin'.
I told tina about all the affairs... You had, Gil.
so many years of lies.
Ashley was the final straw for me.
but Tina promised me no one would get hurt.
honey, how could she promise you anything?
she did not know what the hell she was doin'.
it was just scraps of information.
if it was just scraps of information...
you wouldn't be sitting here.
Joan, can I talk with you outside?
what are you doing? I was in the middle of
if the Indonesians frame ashley, She'll contest it in court.
it'll be messy. Public.
right. Right. She's a loose end.
so they frame her, then they get rid of her.
make it look like an accident or a suicide.
I sent Annie to the rowing club. She's bringing her in right now.
you're telling me to call in backup, right?
this is the moment You choose to appreciate the chain of command? Go.
Madeline Jarvis has been passing state secrets to the Indonesian government.
she's at langley now being debriefed.
she was gonna frame you for treason, Ashley.
that's impossible. - No, it's not.
it's sick, but it's not impossible.
how?
and how would she convince anyone that I did it?
you took handwritten notes when he came back from intelligence briefings.
senator Jarvis had you compare missions estimates
with back-of-the-envelope calculations you could find.
he'd have you find the cost of, say, a helicopter.
in the event that it was destroyed during an operation, It needed to be replaced.
but it meant he was revealing pieces of highly protected information.
all she had to do was compare your handwritten notes
and your history of internet searches.
and the only evidence of any leak or notes... In my handwriting.
right.
Madeline told me she sold intel On four fully funded missions
operation cauldron, Operation side alley,
operation goliath, And operation blackjack.
keep me apprised of the sandstorm.
if it picks up any more velocity-- - Auggie.
operation goliath might be compromised.
it's too late. - Why?
Goliath is on. They went radio silent 20 minutes ago.
I trusted you. I know.
it was my job to get you to trust me.
no.
your job is to trick people and ruin their lives.
what you do for a living Is far worse than anything I've ever done.
there are lives at stake, Ashley.
put another ask in Peshawar.
get us a location on kiev four.
we need sustained visuals that we can't get From our surveillance drones.
so we're gonna piggyback onto a russian satellite.
kiev four should do it. - Nothing, Auggie.
when was your last contact with base camp?
17 minutes ago.
they're walking right into it.
the special ops unit is approaching the compound.
we're out of options.
no, we're not. Kill the drone.
what? - Smash it into the compound.
it's a warning. I know my guys. They'll know what it means.
okay. Do it. - Copy that.
when the drone hits the compound, The unit should radio in the aborted mission, right?
they should. If they don't, it means either the drone hit my guys
or they were ambushed by Nasir's men.
direct hit. The explosion's from inside the compound.
it was booby-trapped.
this is alpha. We're aborting mission goliath.
repeat-- aborting mission goliath.
copy that.
you okay?
just take nice, easy breaths.
that's gonna hurt for a while.
I don't wanna disappear.
you don't have to take the fall.
there's no game anymore. - I don't understand.
the agency wanted to follow the fake intel up the food chain
with him in custody, Tina Varma knows Madeline's working for us.
I don't have to give up my life?
no.
but the one I have will never be the same.
no. It won't.
good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
I have always considered myself a patriot...
an honest man.
it is, indeed, a terrible thing...
to realize that you have deceived yourself.
it's not an affair.
I lost my job at Brookings two months ago.
I didn't want to tell Danielle.
that explains you coming out of a hotel?
it was a job fair, Annie.
I've got a phd in healthcare policy, and I'm handing out resumes in a ballroom.
we're living on savings now.
what am I supposed to tell her? - The truth.
my sister's a better person than you're giving her credit for.
I don't want to lose her. - Then don't lie to her.
my wife faces charges of treason.
my chief of staff faces public shame And damage to her career that cannot be undone.
and so I humbly apologize...
to my wife, to my chief of staff,
my constituents, my supporters,
and to the country that I love...
but am no longer worthy to serve.
my resignation is immediate,
my shame...
unending.
and I can only pray that at some point in the future...
you find the power to forgive.
five mins - Yes all day.
dinner.
see You. - Bye.
we're not going to the Green Briar next week.
michael has to finish a policy paper and can't get away.
mommy, mommy, Chloe's teasing me!
I am not! She's teasing me, mommy!
didn't you need some time away from them?
Oh.Never.
I have to ask. -No, you don't.
when you picked up yesterday's outfit off the floor this morning,
did you think no one would notice?
no comment. - You're on the walk of shame.
you're holding my arm, so technically, it's our walk of shame.
although, it hardly seems fair you get the shame and no fun.
who is it?
that is so funny that you think I'm gonna tell you.
Hey. Conference room, guys.
Joan. The sound of your necklace gives you up.
I only like that trick when you do it to other people.
special activities division is en route to brief you.
this week, you belong to them, but we're goa let you operate out of here because...
not everyone has a braille keyboard and an embedded document reader with voice recognition?
because I know you like your desk arranged just so.
this drone is programmed to drop hellfire missiles on a meeting of all-star tribal leaders.
what's wrong with this picture?
no one was there. They knew we were coming.
this is the third mission in two weeks that has been compromised.
after the first, we shut down assets in Syria and Iraq...
to no avail. So it's happening on our side.
that was the theory. We also limited briefings to essential personnel in clandestine services.
mission details still got out. - Who could it be?
there's really only one possibility left. A United States senator.
more specifically, a member of the intelligence committee.
they have compartmented clearance higher than top secret.
only they have access to these missions.
I don't have to tell you all how big this is.
no member of the senate's been convicted for treason since 1797.
but how? The senate intelligence briefing room is secure.
no documents. Not even notes can be taken out.
well, that's where all of you come in.
each of you will use your undercover to gain access to a targeted senator.
Jai's running point on his.
okay. Read-in privileges. There are none.
this is completely off book.
if the senate knew we were spying on them in their own backyard,
we'd have another fisa situation.
why are we doing it?
because you're young and you're nobody.
you'll fit in perfectly on Capitol Hill.
who'd ya get? - Darton.
lame duck facing ethics charges. I like my chances.
I got Wallenberg.
isn't he the only one who opposed the war?
Oh, yeah. Who'd you get?
Gil jarvis. The committee chair.
he's not the leak. - Joan basically said that.
senator Jarvis's office. Please hold.
can I help you? - Annie walker.
I'm here from the Smithsonian to switch out the art.
as a courtesy every term, we make pieces available
to members of the museum's board of regents...
like the senator.
but you don't have an appointment.
my office should have called ahead-- can I see?
I was hostess at the palm in Miami for two summers.
well, who do I talk to?
you must be the Smithsonian gal.
I'm Gil Jarvis. Good to meet you.
Annie Walker. Thanks for making time for me, senator.
my pleasure. But you have to thank my lovely wife Madeline.
that's her lovely desk.
she's in charge of the way things look around here.
come with me. Now, you don't want to hang around too long.
she'll try to give you a makeover.
not that you need one.
please.
she did this room. There's no wet bar.
I just think Washington has had its fill of drunken senators.
finally, a woman who's interested In something more than politics.
the Smithsonian called about you this morning. Welcome.
thank you.
senator, they're ready for you.
Ashley, this is Annie Walker from the Smithsonian.
she's gonna be taking things down and puttin' stuff up.
Hi. Ashley briggs. Chief of staff.
Hi. I have that exact same sweater.
good taste.
Annie. How do we get our hands on Wyeth's whooping crane piece?
I think it would be a perfect vertical For the reception area.
teachers union and Pakistan.
I'll find out. Andrew Wyeth.
no. N.C. Wyeth. Not the other one.
I said the whooping crane piece.
Y- you do know the collection, don't you?
actually, we have nature paintings from both Wyeths in our collection,
but I will make sure that you get the right one.
what's after the meetin'?
I need to freshen you on Pakistan, and we can do the rundown
on the way to your 5: 00 p. m.intel briefing.
excellent. Ladies. We're on our way.
somethin' with animals.
you know, I just-- I just love animals. Yeah.
you treat them like eggs!
well, they're borrowed es.
I don't want to be the one to break 'em.
Hey, Jimmy. Frederico.
Yeah, we gotta make sure custodial hits Jarvis's goods tonight.
Yeah, we got plaster on the carpet.
Oh, right, it's Tuesday.
okay, well, tell him to hit it good in the morning then.
are you from Catarina?
you know Brazil?
Catarina's a tough place.
no. It's the best city.
everyone here thinks I'm Mexican.
they try to talk Spanish to me.
portugese is my favorite language.
Frederico, what happens in senator Jarvis's office on Tuesdays?
he worked late that night.
I know he has a 5: 00 p. m. briefing, But then what?
all they say is no noisy vacuum.
Oh. So you're not allowed in there at all.
no. But they clean his office two times, on Wednesday early in the morning,
and later time tonight.
CIA headquarters
you look perplexed.
Perplexed? - Puzzled. Confused.
in need of a drink with a coworker.
I can't.
Jarvis has a secret meeting in his office Tuesday nights
after the intel briefing.
I have to find out who's invited and what goes on.
and you think you're going to find an answer doodling...
curly, twirly thingies?
Pinwheels.
no. You're right.
I have to go back, don't I?
if you want answers, you have to dig.
remember, these senators aren't gods.
they wanna be liked and they wanna succeed.
they're fallible. Just like you and me.
just don't get caught.
it's a small painting, but it's priceless.
I probably just left it on his cart.
I'll be quick. - Nope. I'm not authorized.
if we wait till morning and it's gone,
Frederico and anyone who ever stamped his time card
is gonna be held accountable.
there.
I need a swipe card duplicated so I can return the original to its rightful owner.
Spencer in I. T. - Thanks.
Oh, whoa. 'scuse me, ma'am.
hard drives you needed, sir? - Oh, yeah, thank you.
can you put them on the table? - Yes, sir.
I'm playing catcher on operation goliath.
that's for that high-threat tribal leader. What's his name?
he's holed up on a compound on the Pak-Afghan border.
I'm dealing with incoming chatter and handling logistics.
right now I am bingeing on power drinks
because, with a ten-hour time difference,
I'm gonna be here all night.
you're oddly mesmerizing.
so the legend goes.
can I ask you a question about men?
way too general a question for me to sign off on.
do most men cheat on their spouses?
where are you going with this?
my brother-in-law said he was gonna be in the office all day,
and then I saw him walk out of a hotel this afternoon.
power nap? - I'm serious.
well, maybe he had a lunch there.
at 4: 00 p. M? - I
I'm looking for an August?
Yep, right here. You from S. A.D?
Yes, sir. I've got the landsat thematic mapping you requested.
Spencer in I. T.
no, I already have e landsat calculations.
I need NGA to send me aster data. Got it?
okay. I guess he's gone.
two more senators cleared. Pack is thinning.
now we know Jarvis isn't only corruptible but vulnerable.
little too vulnerable. Nice diggin'.
I did a little on my own.
Ashley's not his first, I take it.
not even his third.
he uses cash for most of the mistress upkeep, like jewelry and vacations.
but he can't seem to resist using membership cards to get points at the restaurants.
classy.
current squeeze ashley rowed all four years at colgate.
her bank statements show membership dues at the congressional rowing club.
I'll pay her a visit, do a little girl bonding.
Oh, remember. Jarvis holds the cia purse strings.
if you're wrong about ashley briggs, it's a misfire.
if you're wrong about jarvis, We'll be lucky to get funding for Commodore 64s.
good luck.
Thanks.
thanks for that.
Hey, auggie, man, We hear it's gridlock down there.
Yeah, we did a sweep at 07：00, And the marcbot four found an ied.
they're clearing it now.
visibility? - New moon.
satellite images show there won't be any cloud cover.
a clear pitch black night. Perfect.
welcome to my world.
Hey, uh... What else you got cookin'?
who's using my itunes account?
I told you he'd figure it out.
we may have downloaded a few tunes.
congressional rowing club
the smithsonian girl. With the sweater.
Annie Walker. Yeah.
well, you can't be rowing in sneakers.
no. I was running. Well, jogging.
actually, walk/jogging. It's a good workout.
well... This is the worst part of rowing, so...
Where's an unpaid intern when you need him?
right.
Thanks.
up here? - Yeah.
you wanna get some coffee? - Yeah, sure.
remember when mom used to put little notes in our lunches?
I never got a note.
awkward.
I guess she loved me more.
Hey, hey! No hitting, girls.
um, I'm gonna try to make it home for their bedtime, but, um...
I won't keep them up.
what's the paper he's working on?
a johns hopkins study about asthma.
he seems stressed. - Yeah, poor guy.
he has to work out of the Baltimore Campus,
which adds two hours to his commute every day.
so he's in Baltimore every day?
Yeah.
Auggie. I'm filing a request with the S. A.D.
to cancel your loan to them for operation goliath.
Why? - Because I need you.
what for?
well, I can't tell you until the S.A.D. gives you back.
don't take me off of goliath. - Why?
because I need to diversify And prove my value outside the dpd.
you don't care about inter-agency politics, and you don't need to
you've got this place wired.
Joan, goliath is personal.
they're guys from my old unit.
I didn't know that.
well, it'd mean a lot to me. - Yeah. Of course.
of course, Auggie. Good luck.
so I said,"Darling, it's like sitting on the beach " trying to count the grains of sand.
all you're gonna get accomplished is getting sunburn on your shoulders and sand up your bum.
I wish I could have been there.
wishing for something has nothing to do with getting it accomplished.
excuse me, Mrs. Jarvis, I was able to locate that painting you wanted.
Oh, thank you! But can I deal with it later?
much later. We have a double date to get ready for.
art can wait.
Tina, this is Tnnie. She's from the Smithsonian.
Mrs. Varma is the wife of the indonesian ambassador.
we were vandy girls, back in the day.
and we still are. Come on, Maddie.
Oh! So Annie, I'll see you tomorrow then?
Yes, ma'am, I will see you tomorrow morning.
Hello, Tina. - Ashley.
Madeline, darling, we're late for our luncheon. We're gonna lose our reservation.
I'm coming, I'm coming.
not a fan?
she is Madeline's one-woman support group.
I suppose I shouldn't resent it, But every time they go out,
the Florida taxpayers foot the bill.
tax dollars at work.
and guess who has to justify it on the expense report?
how 'bout we go rack up our own bill?
we'll have another beer.
Oh, and I'll have yet another margarita.
please. And hold the salt.
did you know this place was a hangout for spooks?
like CIA?
at least we'll know the guys are full of crap.
what is it about this town?
everybody here parties like they're still in college.
we need it. Our days are pressure-filled.
you got a lotta steam to let off.
you think Tina Varma and Madeline Jarvis are on their third round by now?
what?
Tina varma is a gold digger.
she married ambassador Varma Because when they go to indonesia for his home visits,
she gets treated like royalty,
and here she gets to live on other people's expense accounts.

Oh... - So romantic.
wait. He wants to come over now?
now. He's 25.
he expects me to go over there!
I just throw the young ones back.
I think senator Jarvis likes you.
w- why do you say that?
I don't know, it's just like... The way he looks at you.
it's nice, like he really respects you.
he probably wishes he wasn't married.
cone of silence? - Of course.
their marriage is not what it seems.
he told me.
he's lonely. - Well, I...I think he was.
lonely, I mean.
you are in love with him?
Oh, my
he is...Amazing.
he's so sweet, funny, and the most brilliant man I have ever met.
he's gonna leave her After the election.
when do you have time to get together?
every Tuesday night.
and Sunday afternoon, we have a sort of...Date.
that's the most washington thing I've ever heard.
you schedule your affair!
can we see a menu? Please?
and can we get like some chips and salsa? Thanks.
Ashley copped to the affair, and I think...
if she were the leak, She wouldn't breathe a word of it, right?
well, not necessarily. How drunk did you get her?
she got there all on her own. Hey, can you run a name for me?
Yeah. - Tina varma.
she's the wife of the indonesian ambassador.
maybe joan's right. Maybe senator jarvis is being blackmailed.
that's a big leap. And it requires indisputable proof.
indisputable. Got it.
I deeply regret that Ms. Briggs allegedly sold secrets to a foreign govenment.
I just emailed you a draft of a memo I found in madeline's desk.
she must have written it.
it's a resignation speech from the senator.
he says he's gonna quit because ashley sold our secrets.
Jai, the senator's not the leak. Ashley's not the leak.
his wife's the leak.
and she's gonna frame ashley for it.
is that indisputable enough for ya?
Annie, you just hooked a whale.
the White House wants to be read-in on this In real time, Joan.
how'd she do it? How'd she access this information?
you'll know when I know.
what's your game plan? Are you on top of all the
on top of a leak from the head of the senate intelligence committee?
for christ's sake, Marty. We're the head of this investigation.
I'm not doing this jurisdictional pissing match with you.
can we get some coffee? - Our people will tail madeline jarvis.
when she hands off more intel, We will discreetly bring her in.
then we will turn her.
she will work for us.
she will feed bogus traceable intel to her contacts, whoever they may be.
we're going to let her contacts walk away.
Marty, when you're in charge of an investigation,
you can say book 'em and round up whoever you want.
but right now, we're gonna follow this pipeline of information as far as we can,
so that when we do a takedown, we make sure we get everyone.
now, at 50 meters to the structure, You split into three teams
one at the southwest corner, one at the northwest corner,
and the other to the front.
and we suspended all flybys for those 20 minutes.
we have a convoy of backup vehicles in peshawar At the ready.
Hey, we are good to go, bro.

how do you know?
he said he was gonna be in Baltimore all day,

well, maybe she knows, and she's just looking the other way.
the woman who knows and looks the other way Is an urban myth.
what's up with you?
nothing.
you're... Usually funnier.
S.A.D. Wants nasir alive. That's the imperative based on the newest chatter.
he has a cell in turkey, And I'm stuck at a desk at the dpd

I heard the hesitation in their voices.

I'm sorry for taking up the table.

I haven't paid yet. I could get you something.
thank you. I won't be long.
is there a problem at the museum?
don't tell me we're not getting the Wyeth.
Mrs. Jarvis, I'm not... from the Smithsonian.
of course you are. - No. I'm afraid I'm not.

I need you to come with me to Langley.

his priorities changed.
just for a moment, let's be two women...
who are married to powerful men, okay?
what your husband did to you is terrible.
but what is really crushing
is that pushing Ashley Briggs out of the way wouldn't solve anything.
because another woman would just come along.
and that's why you did it, isn't it?
because you wanted to hurt him irreparably.
you wanted to kill his career.
I just wanted him To come back home with us to gainesville.
I wanted it to be like it was when we first got married.
that's not a marriage. That's a honeymoon.
Ashley was the last mistress Madeline jarvis was willing to tolerate.
now you have to tell ashley to take the fall.
excuse me?
the Indonesians need to believe that their plan is up and running.
that way we can use madeline to feed false information And trace where it goes.
Ashley has to be taken into custody for espionage, Annie.
we're gonna give her a new life.
all she did was get involved with the wrong guy.
who was married. Who was her boss.
think of her as a cautionary tale.
workplace romances always complicate it, Annie, no matter how common it is.
we are go/no go fellas. Stay frosty.
I have to tell a perfectly nice girl That one bad romance has ruined her name.
your sister? - No.
but I like where your head's at.
Oh, uh, I would love to hear about your mission, but not today
Goliath's in position.
yeah? - Yeah!
today, Annie w\Walker, I am a...Closer.
Thanks. - For what?
you're all fired up when those guys are depending on you to be.
so what are you thanking me for?
for inspiring me to look at the bigger picture.
Ashley? - Hey, Annie.
we need to talk.
tell me none of this is happenin'.
I told tina about all the affairs... You had, Gil.
so many years of lies.
Ashley was the final straw for me.
but Tina promised me no one would get hurt.
honey, how could she promise you anything?
she did not know what the hell she was doin'.
it was just scraps of information.
if it was just scraps of information...
you wouldn't be sitting here.
Joan, can I talk with you outside?
what are you doing? I was in the middle of
if the Indonesians frame ashley, She'll contest it in court.
it'll be messy. Public.
right. Right. She's a loose end.
so they frame her, then they get rid of her.
make it look like an accident or a suicide.
I sent Annie to the rowing club. She's bringing her in right now.
you're telling me to call in backup, right?
this is the moment You choose to appreciate the chain of command? Go.
Madeline Jarvis has been passing state secrets to the Indonesian government.
she's at langley now being debriefed.
she was gonna frame you for treason, Ashley.
that's impossible. - No, it's not.
it's sick, but it's not impossible.
how?
and how would she convince anyone that I did it?
you took handwritten notes when he came back from intelligence briefings.
senator Jarvis had you compare missions estimates
with back-of-the-envelope calculations you could find.
he'd have you find the cost of, say, a helicopter.
in the event that it was destroyed during an operation, It needed to be replaced.
but it meant he was revealing pieces of highly protected information.
all she had to do was compare your handwritten notes
and your history of internet searches.
and the only evidence of any leak or notes... In my handwriting.
right.
Madeline told me she sold intel On four fully funded missions
operation cauldron, Operation side alley,
operation goliath, And operation blackjack.
keep me apprised of the sandstorm.
if it picks up any more velocity-- - Auggie.
operation goliath might be compromised.
it's too late. - Why?
Goliath is on. They went radio silent 20 minutes ago.
I trusted you. I know.
it was my job to get you to trust me.
no.
your job is to trick people and ruin their lives.
what you do for a living Is far worse than anything I've ever done.
there are lives at stake, Ashley.
put another ask in Peshawar.
get us a location on kiev four.
we need sustained visuals that we can't get From our surveillance drones.
so we're gonna piggyback onto a russian satellite.
kiev four should do it. - Nothing, Auggie.
when was your last contact with base camp?
17 minutes ago.
they're walking right into it.
the special ops unit is approaching the compound.
we're out of options.
no, we're not. Kill the drone.
what? - Smash it into the compound.
it's a warning. I know my guys. They'll know what it means.
okay. Do it. - Copy that.
when the drone hits the compound, The unit should radio in the aborted mission, right?
they should. If they don't, it means either the drone hit my guys
or they were ambushed by Nasir's men.
direct hit. The explosion's from inside the compound.
it was booby-trapped.
this is alpha. We're aborting mission goliath.
repeat-- aborting mission goliath.
copy that.
you okay?
just take nice, easy breaths.
that's gonna hurt for a while.
I don't wanna disappear.
you don't have to take the fall.
there's no game anymore. - I don't understand.
the agency wanted to follow the fake intel up the food chain
with him in custody, Tina Varma knows Madeline's working for us.
I don't have to give up my life?
no.
but the one I have will never be the same.
no. It won't.
good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
I have always considered myself a patriot...
an honest man.
it is, indeed, a terrible thing...
to realize that you have deceived yourself.
it's not an affair.
I lost my job at Brookings two months ago.
I didn't want to tell Danielle.
that explains you coming out of a hotel?
it was a job fair, Annie.
I've got a phd in healthcare policy, and I'm handing out resumes in a ballroom.
we're living on savings now.
what am I supposed to tell her? - The truth.
my sister's a better person than you're giving her credit for.
I don't want to lose her. - Then don't lie to her.
my wife faces charges of treason.
my chief of staff faces public shame And damage to her career that cannot be undone.
and so I humbly apologize...
to my wife, to my chief of staff,
my constituents, my supporters,
and to the country that I love...
but am no longer worthy to serve.
my resignation is immediate,
my shame...
unending.
and I can only pray that at some point in the future...
you find the power to forgive.
good morning.
stupid Internet.
what's with the four seasons breakfast spread?
taking pictures for my catering site. Don't touch...
sorry. I didn't know.
it doesn't matter.
it takes, like, 200 pictures to get anything worth using, and now I can't upload.
how am I supposed to start a business?
you don't have to get everything to work instantly.
I know.
it's just every other mom in the playgroup works at least part-time.
and now with Michael out of work...
he knows you're trying.
and super mom is not an easy job.
but if you're gonna do this breakfast thing, you think you can get fresh squeezed?
because this OJ from concentrate tastes like sand.
Oh, no!
wait.
don't move, that's the perfect light.
okay, ready?
mommy, Elmo went away.
cable's out.
you know, I don't know if you've heard, but most of the civilized world went Hi-Def a few years back.
I never claimed to be civilized.
Plus, I haven't had much use for a new TV lately.
you may not, but I wanna watch myself in 1080p when that call from Charlie Rose comes in.
what makes me think that that's only gonna happen when I'm on trial for espionage?
silly Auggie.
you're not the only person I know at the CIA.
just the only one you're sleeping with.
or maybe not.
you know it's just you.
and the others are...?
just sources. - Sources?
I'm not a source.
you're a source of happiness.
do we have time?
don't they call in the cavalry when you miss work?
Not...If...I...
call in.
the cable is out, phone is out...
it's not the 13th already, is it?
Yeah, why? - I've gotta go.
Joan, hear me out.
there was a metro-wide communication shutdown today.
no cable, no Internet, no cellular network.
and I bet the satellite array was down for ten minutes.
that's classified.
it was more like 15.
this was not an accident, I guarantee you.
there is a hacker out there somewhere who is trying to make a name for themself.
the Datatech conference starts today.
you gotta send me in. There's a briefing in ten.
signals intelligence is running point.
I'm going in?
you're going in.
has anyone ever told you you look amazing in that color?
why do I have the feeling you're about to?
what do you call that color, anyway?
blue.
well, blue really suits you.
briefing time, kids.
you do not wanna miss this one.
why are you so happy? - I'm going to Datatech.
Data-what? - Datatech.
it's a computer security conference.
it's like comic-con for nerds.
isn't that just comic-con?
Oh, Harry.
a couple of years ago, some national security genius decided it would be a good idea to sit down with the black cat types.
now, twice a year, 1,000 hackers converge on Washington and 1, 000 law enforcement types pick their brains and, in many cases, hire them.
and this has him wound up because...?
he's a dork.
and it was his cover.
Oh, and it will be again.
this morning, a well-coordinated cyber attack took down civil communication systems in the D. C. area.
it also briefly disrupted our secure satellite link.
the hack is reminiscent of a 2007 event that temporarily disabled phone service to the Pentagon.
but this one takes advantage of a security flaw we've never seen before.
the Pentagon believes that select government servers may be susceptible to this hack.
isn't cyber crime FBI territory?
cyber crime is, cyber terrorism is not.
everyone's gonna want a piece of this one...
spy agencies, terror groups, organized crime.
so who do we think did the hack?
we've been analyzing the code and a familiar name has popped up.
you're gonna find this interesting.
what?
no. No.
Natasha Petrovna appears to be behind the attack.
what is it?
Natasha Petrovna is my ex-girlfriend.
Natasha Petrovna, born and raised in St. Petersburg, graduate degree in computer security from Lomonsov university, now a member of the Swedish-founded pirate bureau.
a card-carrying anarchist.
barber from tech intel will fill you in.
Natasha was busted two years ago for illegally accessing department of agriculture servers.
she was demonstrating a firewall hack.
there was no further intent.
Ah, justice department didn't think so.
she just spent two years at Danbury Women's Correctional Center.
Yeah, I'm well aware.
that's where Martha Stewart did her time.
that's pretty good company. Paroled in February, it seems that Ms. Petrovna is back to her old ways.
the infection vectors from this morning's hack were classic Petrovna.
elegant, efficient, and pointed.
that's Natasha all right.
Auggie, we're sending you to Datatech to reunite with Natasha and negotiate a consulting deal.
we're gonna pay her off?
we're the only government agency who can.
we'll go as high as 2 million.
Natasha's father was a political prisoner under Brezhnev.
she hates the government.
if we try to pay her off, she's only gonna stonewall us more.
well, we've had very good luck at this agency using money to get people to re-examine their ideals.
Annie, you're gonna be his eyes.
Datatech is already underway;
there's not a moment to lose.
you know that putting me on this mission is a bad idea.
it's not gonna make Natasha any more cooperative.
you're the one who wanted back into the field.
if we buy this tech, she's gonna learn I'm CIA.
yeah? - You're kidding.
two years ago I can't say anything, and now I'm just supposed to announce that I'm a spy?
look.
I know this isn't easy.
but you of all people know how hard it is to get ahold of technology like this.
we really need this hack.
Hey, before I forget,
I found some pictures of you up on the Internet.
what?
so you've got an Annie Walker Google alert now?
are you cyber stalking me?
actually, personnel sent me the link.
they'd like you to take them down for security purposes.
but I do like this one.
Auggie, are you ready to go?
I guess.
I gotta stop at home and change. Can you drive?
how serious was it with this Natasha girl?
we had fun.
cause you're the good time guy.
what's that?
nothing.
solo board games?
don't touch that.
I'm playing an Internet game with a girl from Brazil.
well...
at least I think she's a girl.
at least I think it's Brazil.
are you ready?
where did you get that? 1986?
Datatech has something of an unofficial dress code.
you can always tell the type of person you're dealing with based on their look.
hackers are the ones in t-shirts with no sense of personal hygiene.
the more employable variant is the security consultant, whose workplace requires collared shirts usually feature short sleeves so they can show off their body art in defiance of their corporate overlords.
blue jackets and khakis are always law enforcement.
the bureau's never been known for their subtlety.
what about $1, 000 suits and silk ties?
europeans.
never really got nerd fashion.
the FBI does not like to comment on ongoing investigations.
but in general, I can tell you that we are...
who are these guys on stage?
used to be FBI's most wanted.
now they're Datatech celebrities.
as for the case you asked about, the copyright holder is a U. S. corporation...
doesn't it strike you as odd how many criminals are able to just exist here?
not exist, thrive.
this is the wild west of the information age.
think Billy the kid and Pat Garrett didn't sit down for a sarsaparilla once and a while?
does that answer your question?
my question is for Mr. Phillips.
how can the FBI defend the warrantless wiretap program while at the same time claiming a need for secrecy to avoid the freedom of information act?
shouldn't access go both ways?
well, first you have to remember that, at the time...
Natasha, right? - Yeah.
the warrantless wiretap program had been authorized by a federal judge.
the purpose for... She's pretty.
Yeah.
you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
and by tapping into their phones, that was just one of the few methods that we used...
she's talking to the Europeans.
it doesn't seem friendly.
they're probably offering her money as well.
then we should change our strategy.
Yeah. Take me over there.
wait. - What?
she's right in front of you.
hold up. Tash?
didn't see that coming.
you should have.
do you know what I've been through the last two years?
no, I meant because I'm blind.
Ugh. I'm...I'm so sorry, Auggie.
no, it's not your fault.
I buried the lede.
how are you?
this isn't fair.
you can't come here after what you did to me and expect me to feel sorry for you.
I don't want anyone to feel sorry for me.
I just wanna talk to you.
I sat there, Auggie.
I sat there at Kinkead's waiting for you, and you never showed.
two days later, I was arrested by the FBI.
it was a hell of a week. I can explain.
don't bother, I'm walking away now.
Tash, please, I know you're behind that hack today.
I want in.
not here.
who's she? Your seeing -eye dog?
Natasha, this is my business partner, Annie Walker.
don't be fooled by his act.
he's a good hacker, lousy boyfriend.
I can assure you our relationship is purely professional.
define "professional."
the kind of professionalism that can offer you $2 million.
I can't believe you don't know me well enough to know I'm not interested in money.
I have to ask for my company.
tell your company they can have my code tomorrow when I release it wide at noon.
no group, no person should get to control information any more than they should control all the world's oil or food.
you know that's simplistic, Tash.
there are groups in there that wanna destabilize personal security, government security.
it'd be chaos.
I'll turn over my code when your company releases its copyrights.
that's not the kind of company I work for.
what do you mean?
I'm CIA.
always have been.
I'm sorry, I couldn't tell you until now.
well, that could've gone better.
so Natasha was just someone you had fun with back in the day?
no, maybe I undersold the relationship a little.
you think?
four years ago, I was breaking in my cover talking tech to random people.
so I was in a laundromat in Adams Morgan, and Natasha was reading snow crash while she waited for her whites.
we dated a little over a year, and I wish I hadn't liked that book so much.
so you broke her heart?
I didn't want to.
I loved her.
I'm not buying it.
you don't break up with someone you're in love with.
you know what, when you work at the CIA, you do.
I put in for a close and continuing with a foreign national, and the agency told me to cut off all contact.
well, I can't imagine they'd be too happy about you dating a Russian anarchist.
well, I knew she was rebellious,
I just didn't know how rebellious.
the FBI had her in a sting.
which is why she thinks you abandoned her.
I did.
all I wanted to do was protect her, and I couldn't.
we made contact.
and Natasha was unresponsive to our initial offer.
epic fail would be a better term.
told you she hated me.
Auggie, she doesn't hate you.
if anything, she still loves you.
you don't get that passionate about someone if you don't love them.
Ah.
dude, a blind guy works here.
don't rearrange the furniture.
sorry about that. - I got it.
Natasha's gonna release the hack tomorrow.
everyone at the conference knows.
Yeah, and everyone at that conference will know how to do major damage immediately.
right, so this needs to happen fast.
Auggie, you're going back in there tomorrow.
am I the only one paying attention here?
Natasha won't negotiate with me.
guys, can we have the room?
Auggie, you know this, people can be turned for three reasons...
money, patriotism, or love.
I'm not sure she loves me anymore.
this isn't about her feelings.
it's about yours.
if you do still care for Natasha, then you know that what I'm asking you to do is the right thing for her.
Yeah.
okay, I'm your man.
Oh, come on.
rough day?
like you read about.
how can working at a museum be so stressful?
it's not the work, it's the people.
one of my coworkers there...
I met his ex-girlfriend today.
she is nothing at all like I expected.
she's like... Chaos in a bottle.
you sound jealous.
hardly. I feel sorry for her.
I think this guy's more of a player than I originally thought.
so now you take an interest?
no, it's just he's definitely sleeping with someone he hasn't told me about.
you know when you think you know someone, and then you find out they had this whole other life?
this is really good.
speaking of which, check this out.
I know you're gonna hate me, but I need you to take those photos down.
what?
you know how hard it was for me to get these.
I know, it's just...
I want the people at work to think of me as professional.
do you have to knock over everybody's sand castle?
this site isn't about you, Annie; It's about food.
and not professional?
fine.
stupid computer.
sorry, I'm almost ready.
there's fresh coffee.
well, I had a crappy night so I hope you're in a better mood today.
let's just get this over with.
Auggie, please tell me that you're not so pissed about this assignment that you called Liza Hearn.
I didn't. I swear.
we're dating.
you're the leak.
come on, Annie. You know me better than that.
do I? Up until yesterday,
I had no idea you were... I'm running an op on her.
I'm working her to get to her source.
does... does Joan know? - No.
if she knew, she'd farm it out.
according to the NCS, I'm not fit for field work.
you gotta report it, Auggie.
this is the woman who's trying to destroy the agency.
Why? So she can give it to Jai?
James Bond was a lonely, sad, old man.
what does that mean?
it means I can't believe you're the kind of guy who would exploit a woman for intel.
what do you think I'm supposed to do with Natasha?
I'm here.
happy?
thank you for meeting me.
so where is your all -seeing CIA?
they're right here.
Tash, I know you don't have any reason to trust me.
but you have to know I never wanted to break up with you.
the CIA made me do it.
so they control your love life too?
I'm not gonna defend it.
leaving you was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.
Wow. So you're the victim?
Tash, I almost quit the agency.
when they told me I couldn't see you again, the only thing I could do was get as far away from here as possible.
I went to Iraq.
six months later, I was blind.
we shouldn't be listening.
I know Auggie's a friend, but today he's an op.
he knows we're here.
he could be lying to her.
blue blazers and khakis.
FBI's making a move.
heads -up, Auggie. FBI at your 3: 00.
Tash, I don't want you to freak out but we have FBI agents across the street coming this way.
what did you do? - I had nothing to do with this.
but as long as you're with me, they won't do anything.
if you walk away, I can't protect you.
so this isn't a negotiation.
you're here to dictate terms.
I want you to do the right thing.
sorry, Auggie.
give me your hand.
now, now!
are you all right? Tash?
TASH! Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
TASH! Where'd she go?
I don't see her.
what do you mean, she disappeared?
I pulled her away from the car, she let go of my hand, and she was gone.
okay. So what have we got?
okay, police found the SUV abandoned at a bus stop about a mile from the hotel.
traffic cameras photographed t these too.
those are the guys from the conference.
they were the ones arguing with Natasha.
that's Alexander Markov and Yuri Tretiak.
these guys are career criminals with ties to the RBN crime syndicate.
makes sense. Cyber crime is evolving.
it's mafia 2. 0.
damn it.
organized crime is FBI territory.
okay, package up what we have and send it to them.
God, I hate playing second chair.
what about Natasha?
FBI are gonna have to deal with that when they find her. - - FBI?
she's in danger. She's not our problem anymore.
I told her we'd protect her.
the bureau is telling everyone that CIA interfered with an investigation.
we've played our cards, it's over.
so this is how it goes?
Natasha gets the screw again because of an inter-agency pissing match.
boy, I love my job.
as a security professional,
I would advise you to change the locks after you dump a girl who has your house key.
Jesus, Natasha.
who was in the car?
what? - Was it CIA?
no, of course not. It was the Russian mob.
Oh, God.
what did you do?
before I lived here, before I was pirate bureau, in university in Moscow, there were these guys.
they had flashy clothes, lots of money.
at first, it was nothing.
translating bits of code for them.
but then they drew you in.
first with money, then with threats.
ever since then, everything I do they think they have a piece of.
and they want you to turn over the hack only to them.
they feel they own me.
own my code.
they said they would kill me if I didn't turn it over.
when they saw me talking with you...
Jesus, Tash, you're in danger.
let me take you in. --No, CIA got me into this.
those mob guys will not stop until they get the hack.
the CIA can protect you.
you act so self-righteous, but what makes you different from the mobsters?
you both want to control the code that I wrote.
you have to trust someone.
I trust the world.
that's why I want to release the hack.
trusting everyone is the same as trusting no one.
Trust...Hmm.
it's not easy, Auggie.
and yet, you're here.
maybe he's just hungover, sleeping it off.
this is a guy who's never late for anything.
he knows the protocol. Auggie would've called in.
so what are you thinking?
well, that's not Auggie's.
the train? Really?
are you trying to make this as annoying as possible?
Ah. - Oh, step.
you don't like being stuck on the rails?
I remember us having an amazing time on the metro to crystal city.
we weren't running for our lives.
we are now.
what do you mean, he's out of pocket?
Auggie's not at his apartment, and it looks like Natasha Petrovna was.
okay, I'm attempting to trace the last known location of his cell phone.
don't bother, it's right here.
along with his keys and his I. D.
anything we could use to trace them is right here in front of us.
look, Auggie knows what he's doing, and we're not gonna find him unless...
DHS flags all cash transactions for transit tickets, right?
Yeah.
I need you guys to check all the stores around Auggie's apartment.
see if any of them activated a high value disposable credit card last night.
barber, are you there?
Yeah, I'm typing.
Oh, okay. Okay, here we go.
the gas-n-sip at 18th and Calvert activated two $500 cards last night at 1: 16 A. M. and one of them was used to buy tickets on Amtrak 3312 to Montreal this morning.
find a table near the middle. I need to hear.
I still don't know what you're looking for.
I'm looking for a passenger with a nexus immigration fast-pass card.
digital documents are easier to fake than paper.
here. - Here?
I'll just hack into the passenger manifests.
it'll be so much easier.
what, no. Tash, Tash.
I don't need the data. I need an actual card.
we'd be better going bag-to-bag to find the card.
and a blind guy and a smoking hot Russian girl looking through other people's bags wouldn't attract any attention?
it's better than you trying to divine a card using esp.
so are you gonna give me this hack?
is that what this is?
you're playing me to get my code for the CIA?
no, I'm trying to help you.
but I do still think you'd be better off entrusting it to the CIA, rather than everyone in the world.
a chef special with a side of back bacon.
and could I get another serviette?
Oh, and separate receipts, please.
that guy, what is he wearing?
green suit, ugly tie.
and what does that tell you?
he's a businessman with no style?
no, he's a Canadian businessman.
an American would've ordered ham or Canadian bacon.
he ordered back bacon, and she asked for a serviette.
take me over there. Follow my lead.
excuse us, folks.
we're with the transit company's hospitality department and we're conducting a survey to try and improve our level of service.
do you mind answering a couple of questions?
we'd be happy to. - Great, thank you.
okay, first question.
on a scale from one to eight, how would you rate your travel experience thus far?
next stop, Albany.
eight? - Yeah, it was great.
wonderful, I'm very happy to hear that.
the FBI is stopping the train at Albany.
I think Auggie wants us, not the FBI, to find him.
how else do you explain the scrabble board and the credit card scraps?
those are bread crumbs.
or he could've just been sloppy.
I think he's running Natasha.
or he's helping her get to Canada.
do you really think that?
Annie, you've only been here for a few months.
how well do you really know Auggie?
okay, regardless of which one of you is right, we need to get to him before the FBI does.
they're still furious at us for losing Natasha.
I want you two to follow this down.
got it, we'll liaise with the Albany office.
no, we're gonna keep this in -house.
go to the airfield.
no sign of the girl?
I had my nexus card when we got on the train.
somebody must've stolen it.
it's got CIA written all over it.
nice work.
what do you know? You didn't see anything.
it sounded awesome.
current generation nexus immigration cards have a flaw in the way they were encrypted.
for some reason, the designers left sequential register scanning enabled.
if that's the case, I can parse the addressable memory for the encryption key, and we'll have full redirect capabilities.
I love it when you talk dirty.
how did you know to switch trains?
I've been doing this a long time.
protocol makes people predictable.
you used to be predictable.
uh, no. - Yes.
Yes. Yes, you were so buttoned down.
such a white hat.
what happened?
something unpredictable.
smile.
you didn't break up with me because the agency told you to.
Yes, I did. I can show you the memo.
Oh, please, Auggie. It's a notorious bureaucracy.
that memo probably came after you dumped me.
Wow. I thought I was kidding.
you were the one who didn't wanna move to D. C.
you didn't want a family, you didn't want kids, you didn't... Here we go.
Yes, yes, Tash. Here we go.
you come in and talk to me like I ruined your life, but dating you wasn't easy.
so why bother? - Because I...
because I loved you.
don't ask me to explain it.
I didn't know we had access to a jet.
why don't we fly this more often?
cause our title isn't "director."
we don't come back with Auggie, don't count on flying it again.
he wasn't on the train.
neither was Natasha.
look, I know what you're thinking.
that I'm an asshole for not trusting Auggie.
so you're a bit of a mind reader?
look, as hard as it may be for you to believe,
I do like Auggie.
but if I put my personal feelings ahead of analysis, then I'm not doing my job.
I trust Auggie.
and I respect that.
but in our business, we can't rely on trust alone.
if we're wrong about Auggie... I know I'm right.
let's assume you are right, he's running Natasha.
it is still a huge breach of protocol.
wait.
CIA protocol, always travel unpredictably.
Amtrak splits at Albany to both Montreal and Toronto.
you think they switched trains?
Yeah.
do you trust me?
I'll go talk to the pilot.
please remain in your compartments and have immigration documents ready, for passport control will be coming through the cabin.
thank you.
we're in.
we already showed our cards.
I'll get rid of them.
wait, Tash. Wait.
wait!
Tash, talk to me, how many?
how many?
two!
Tash, hit the lights.
hit the lights!
get dressed. Fast.
we're gonna have to jump.
we're gonna jump off a moving train?
we'll slow down at Niagara on the lake for coupling to the Canadian system.
the FBI will jump on then, and we'll jump off.
okay, the FBI will start at the ends and work their way in.
do you see anybody out there?
they're out there, they're coming.
good.
they can't set up on the eastern side because of the lake.
when you see the ops team coming in the back door, that's when we go.
I'm a big girl, Auggie. I can take it from here.
Tash, I couldn't help you before.
I am not abandoning you now.
what if I told you I couldn't give you the code?
if I didn't have it? Would you still help me?
Yes.
Yes, I want to help you.
that's the answer I wanted to hear.
this is the source code.
everything you need is right here.
I love you, Auggie.
Where's Natasha?
Jai, don't worry. I got the hack.
told you.
Hey, did you guys get to ride on the jet?
Where's the girl?
I didn't see anybody.
I know what you wanna hear.
that I knew Natasha had the hack the whole time and I was just playing her.
working her like an asset to get it back.
but the truth...
I don't know.
in order to be a good operative, you need to play on emotions.
and sometimes that means you have to become emotional yourself.
is that a compliment? - It is.
and just for variety, here's a threat to go along with it.
don't ever do what you did again.
have you heard from her?
no.
no, I don't imagine I'll ever talk to her again.
so...
was it worth it?
guess I am qualified for field work after all.
speaking of which...
I assume you are elliptically trying to get me to talk about Liza Hearn.
what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna get as much information as I can and then turn it all over to Joan.
and then I'm gonna end it.
okay?
it's okay with me if it's okay with you.
I trust you.
thank you.
you're not such a bad sister after all.
sorry.
let me see, let me see.
okay.
good morning.
stupid Internet.
what's with the four seasons breakfast spread?
taking pictures for my catering site. Don't touch...
sorry. I didn't know.
it doesn't matter.
it takes, like, 200 pictures to get anything worth using, and now I can't upload.
how am I supposed to start a business?
you don't have to get everything to work instantly.
I know.
it's just every other mom in the playgroup works at least part-time.
and now with Michael out of work...
he knows you're trying.
and super mom is not an easy job.
but if you're gonna do this breakfast thing, you think you can get fresh squeezed?
because this oj from concentrate tastes like sand.
Oh, no!
wait.
don't move, that's the perfect light.
okay, ready?
mommy, Elmo went away.
cable's out.
you know, I don't know if you've heard, but most of the civilized world went hi-def a few years back.
I never claimed to be civilized.
Plus, I haven't had much use for a new tv lately.
you may not, but I wanna watch myself in 1080p when that call from Charlie rose comes in.
what makes me think that that's only gonna happen when I'm on trial for espionage?
silly Auggie.
you're not the only person I know at the CIA.
just the only one you're sleeping with.
or maybe not.
you know it's just you.
and the others are...?
just sources. - Sources?
I'm not a source.
you're a source of happiness.
do we have time?
don't they call in the cavalry when you miss work?
Not...If...I...
call in.
the cable is out, phone is out...
it's not the 13th already, is it?
Yeah, why? - I've gotta go.
Joan, hear me out.
there was a metro-wide communication shutdown today.
no cable, no Internet, no cellular network.
and I bet the satellite array was down for ten minutes.
that's classified.
it was more like 15.
this was not an accident, I guarantee you.
there is a hacker out there somewhere who is trying to make a name for themself.
the datatech conference starts today.
you gotta send me in. There's a briefing in ten.
signals intelligence is running point.
I'm going in?
you're going in.
has anyone ever told you you look amazing in that color?
why do I have the feeling you're about to?
what do you call that color, anyway?
blue.
well, blue really suits you.
briefing time, kids.
you do not wanna miss this one.
why are you so happy? - I'm going to datatech.
Data-what? - Datatech.
it's a computer security conference.
it's like comic-con for nerds.
isn't that just comic-con?
Oh, Harry.
a couple of years ago, some national security genius decided it would be a good idea to sit down with the black cat types.
now, twice a year, 1,000 hackers converge on Washington and 1, 000 law enforcement types pick their brains and, in many cases, hire them.
and this has him wound up because...?
he's a dork.
and it was his cover.
Oh, and it will be again.
this morning, a well-coordinated cyber attack took down civil communication systems in the D. C. area.
it also briefly disrupted our secure satellite link.
the hack is reminiscent of a 2007 event that temporarily disabled phone service to the Pentagon.
but this one takes advantage of a security flaw we've never seen before.
the Pentagon believes that select government servers may be susceptible to this hack.
isn't cyber crime FBI territory?
cyber crime is, cyber terrorism is not.
everyone's gonna want a piece of this one...
spy agencies, terror groups, organized crime.
so who do we think did the hack?
we've been analyzing the code and a familiar name has popped up.
you're gonna find this interesting.
what?
no. No.
Natasha Petrovna appears to be behind the attack.
what is it?
Natasha Petrovna is my ex-girlfriend.
Natasha Petrovna, born and raised in St. Petersburg, graduate degree in computer security from Lomonsov university, now a member of the swedish-founded pirate bureau.
a card-carrying anarchist.
barber from tech intel will fill you in.
Natasha was busted two years ago for illegally accessing department of agriculture servers.
she was demonstrating a firewall hack.
there was no further intent.
Ah, justice department didn't think so.
she just spent two years at danbury women's correctional center.
Yeah, I'm well aware.
that's where Martha Stewart did her time.
that's pretty good company. Paroled in February, it seems that Ms. Petrovna is back to her old ways.
the infection vectors from this morning's hack were classic Petrovna.
elegant, efficient, and pointed.
that's Natasha all right.
Auggie, we're sending you to datatech to reunite with Natasha and negotiate a consulting deal.
we're gonna pay her off?
we're the only government agency who can.
we'll go as high as 2 million.
Natasha's father was a political prisoner under brezhnev.
she hates the government.
if we try to pay her off, she's only gonna stonewall us more.
well, we've had very good luck at this agency using money to get people to re-examine their ideals.
Annie, you're gonna be his eyes.
Datatech is already underway;
there's not a moment to lose.
you know that putting me on this mission is a bad idea.
it's not gonna make Natasha any more cooperative.
you're the one who wanted back into the field.
if we buy this tech, she's gonna learn I'm CIA.
yeah? - You're kidding.
two years ago I can't say anything, and now I'm just supposed to announce that I'm a spy?
look.
I know this isn't easy.
but you of all people know how hard it is to get ahold of technology like this.
we really need this hack.
Hey, before I forget,
I found some pictures of you up on the Internet.
what?
so you've got an Annie Walker Google alert now?
are you cyber stalking me?
actually, personnel sent me the link.
they'd like you to take them down for security purposes.
but I do like this one.
Auggie, are you ready to go?
I guess.
I gotta stop at home and change. Can you drive?
how serious was it with this Natasha girl?
we had fun.
cause you're the good time guy.
what's that?
nothing.
solo board games?
don't touch that.
I'm playing an Internet game with a girl from Brazil.
well...
at least I think she's a girl.
at least I think it's Brazil.
are you ready?
where did you get that? 1986?
Datatech has something of an unofficial dress code.
you can always tell the type of person you're dealing with based on their look.
hackers are the ones in t-shirts with no sense of personal hygiene.
the more employable variant is the security consultant, whose workplace requires collared shirts usually feature short sleeves so they can show off their body art in defiance of their corporate overlords.
blue jackets and khakis are always law enforcement.
the bureau's never been known for their subtlety.
what about $1, 000 suits and silk ties?
europeans.
never really got nerd fashion.
the FBI does not like to comment on ongoing investigations.
but in general, I can tell you that we are...
who are these guys on stage?
used to be FBI's most wanted.
now they're datatech celebrities.
as for the case you asked about, the copyright holder is a U. S. corporation...
doesn't it strike you as odd how many criminals are able to just exist here?
not exist, thrive.
this is the wild west of the information age.
think Billy the kid and pat Garrett didn't sit down for a sarsaparilla once and a while?
does that answer your question?
my question is for Mr. Phillips.
how can the FBI defend the warrantless wiretap program while at the same time claiming a need for secrecy to avoid the freedom of information act?
shouldn't access go both ways?
well, first you have to remember that, at the time...
Natasha, right? - Yeah.
the warrantless wiretap program had been authorized by a federal judge.
the purpose for... She's pretty.
Yeah.
you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
and by tapping into their phones, that was just one of the few methods that we used...
she's talking to the Europeans.
it doesn't seem friendly.
they're probably offering her money as well.
then we should change our strategy.
Yeah. Take me over there.
wait. - What?
she's right in front of you.
hold up. Tash?
didn't see that coming.
you should have.
do you know what I've been through the last two years?
no, I meant because I'm blind.
Ugh. I'm...I'm so sorry, Auggie.
no, it's not your fault.
I buried the lede.
how are you?
this isn't fair.
you can't come here after what you did to me and expect me to feel sorry for you.
I don't want anyone to feel sorry for me.
I just wanna talk to you.
I sat there, Auggie.
I sat there at kinkead's waiting for you, and you never showed.
two days later, I was arrested by the FBI.
it was a hell of a week. I can explain.
don't bother, I'm walking away now.
Tash, please, I know you're behind that hack today.
I want in.
not here.
who's she? Your seeing -eye dog?
Natasha, this is my business partner, Annie Walker.
don't be fooled by his act.
he's a good hacker, lousy boyfriend.
I can assure you our relationship is purely professional.
define "professional.
the kind of professionalism that can offer you $2 million.
I can't believe you don't know me well enough to know I'm not interested in money.
I have to ask for my company.
tell your company they can have my code tomorrow when I release it wide at noon.
no group, no person should get to control information any more than they should control all the world's oil or food.
you know that's simplistic, Tash.
there are groups in there that wanna destabilize personal security, government security.
it'd be chaos.
I'll turn over my code when your company releases its copyrights.
that's not the kind of company I work for.
what do you mean?
I'm CIA.
always have been.
I'm sorry, I couldn't tell you until now.
well, that could've gone better.
so Natasha was just someone you had fun with back in the day?
no, maybe I undersold the relationship a little.
you think?
four years ago, I was breaking in my cover talking tech to random people.
so I was in a laundromat in Adams Morgan, and Natasha was reading snow crash while she waited for her whites.
we dated a little over a year, and I wish I hadn't liked that book so much.
so you broke her heart?
I didn't want to.
I loved her.
I'm not buying it.
you don't break up with someone you're in love with.
you know what, when you work at the CIA, you do.
I put in for a close and continuing with a foreign national, and the agency told me to cut off all contact.
well, I can't imagine they'd be too happy about you dating a Russian anarchist.
well, I knew she was rebellious,
I just didn't know how rebellious.
the FBI had her in a sting.
which is why she thinks you abandoned her.
I did.
all I wanted to do was protect her, and I couldn't.
we made contact.
and Natasha was unresponsive to our initial offer.
epic fail would be a better term.
told you she hated me.
Auggie, she doesn't hate you.
if anything, she still loves you.
you don't get that passionate about someone if you don't love them.
Ah.
dude, a blind guy works here.
don't rearrange the furniture.
sorry about that. - I got it.
Natasha's gonna release the hack tomorrow.
everyone at the conference knows.
Yeah, and everyone at that conference will know how to do major damage immediately.
right, so this needs to happen fast.
Auggie, you're going back in there tomorrow.
am I the only one paying attention here?
Natasha won't negotiate with me.
guys, can we have the room?
Auggie, you know this, people can be turned for three reasons...
money, patriotism, or love.
I'm not sure she loves me anymore.
this isn't about her feelings.
it's about yours.
if you do still care for Natasha, then you know that what I'm asking you to do is the right thing for her.
Yeah.
okay, I'm your man.
Oh, come on.
rough day?
like you read about.
how can working at a museum be so stressful?
it's not the work, it's the people.
one of my coworkers there...
I met his ex-girlfriend today.
she is nothing at all like I expected.
she's like... Chaos in a bottle.
you sound jealous.
hardly. I feel sorry for her.
I think this guy's more of a player than I originally thought.
so now you take an interest?
no, it's just he's definitely sleeping with someone he hasn't told me about.
you know when you think you know someone, and then you find out they had this whole other life?
this is really good.
speaking of which, check this out.
I know you're gonna hate me, but I need you to take those photos down.
what?
you know how hard it was for me to get these.
I know, it's just...
I want the people at work to think of me as professional.
do you have to knock over everybody's sand castle?
this site isn't about you, Annie; It's about food.
and not professional?
fine.
stupid computer.
sorry, I'm almost ready.
there's fresh coffee.
well, I had a crappy night so I hope you're in a better mood today.
let's just get this over with.
Auggie, please tell me that you're not so pissed about this assignment that you called Liza Hearn.
I didn't. I swear.
we're dating.
you're the leak.
come on, Annie. You know me better than that.
do I? Up until yesterday,
I had no idea you were... I'm running an op on her.
I'm working her to get to her source.
does... does Joan know? - No.
if she knew, she'd farm it out.
according to the NCS, I'm not fit for field work.
you gotta report it, Auggie.
this is the woman who's trying to destroy the agency.
Why? So she can give it to Jai?
James Bond was a lonely, sad, old man.
what does that mean?
it means I can't believe you're the kind of guy who would exploit a woman for intel.
what do you think I'm supposed to do with Natasha?
I'm here.
happy?
thank you for meeting me.
so where is your all -seeing CIA?
they're right here.
Tash, I know you don't have any reason to trust me.
but you have to know I never wanted to break up with you.
the CIA made me do it.
so they control your love life too?
I'm not gonna defend it.
leaving you was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.
Wow. So you're the victim?
Tash, I almost quit the agency.
when they told me I couldn't see you again, the only thing I could do was get as far away from here as possible.
I went to Iraq.
six months later, I was blind.
we shouldn't be listening.
I know Auggie's a friend, but today he's an op.
he knows we're here.
he could be lying to her.
blue blazers and khakis.
FBI's making a move.
heads -up, Auggie. FBI at your 3: 00.
Tash, I don't want you to freak out but we have FBI agents across the street coming this way.
what did you do? - I had nothing to do with this.
but as long as you're with me, they won't do anything.
if you walk away, I can't protect you.
so this isn't a negotiation.
you're here to dictate terms.
I want you to do the right thing.
sorry, Auggie.
give me your hand.
now, now!
are you all right? Tash?
TASH! Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
TASH! Where'd she go?
I don't see her.
what do you mean, she disappeared?
I pulled her away from the car, she let go of my hand, and she was gone.
okay. So what have we got?
okay, police found the SUV abandoned at a bus stop about a mile from the hotel.
traffic cameras photographed t these too.
those are the guys from the conference.
they were the ones arguing with Natasha.
that's Alexander Markov and Yuri Tretiak.
these guys are career criminals with ties to the RBN crime syndicate.
makes sense. Cyber crime is evolving.
it's mafia 2. 0.
damn it.
organized crime is FBI territory.
okay, package up what we have and send it to them.
God, I hate playing second chair.
what about Natasha?
FBI are gonna have to deal with that when they find her. - - FBI?
she's in danger. She's not our problem anymore.
I told her we'd protect her.
the bureau is telling everyone that CIA interfered with an investigation.
we've played our cards, it's over.
so this is how it goes?
Natasha gets the screw again because of an inter-agency pissing match.
boy, I love my job.
as a security professional,
I would advise you to change the locks after you dump a girl who has your house key.
Jesus, Natasha.
who was in the car?
what? - Was it CIA?
no, of course not. It was the Russian mob.
Oh, God.
what did you do?
before I lived here, before I was pirate bureau, in university in Moscow, there were these guys.
they had flashy clothes, lots of money.
at first, it was nothing.
translating bits of code for them.
but then they drew you in.
first with money, then with threats.
ever since then, everything I do they think they have a piece of.
and they want you to turn over the hack only to them.
they feel they own me.
own my code.
they said they would kill me if I didn't turn it over.
when they saw me talking with you...
Jesus, Tash, you're in danger.
let me take you in. --No, CIA got me into this.
those mob guys will not stop until they get the hack.
the CIA can protect you.
you act so self-righteous, but what makes you different from the mobsters?
you both want to control the code that I wrote.
you have to trust someone.
I trust the world.
that's why I want to release the hack.
trusting everyone is the same as trusting no one.
Trust...Hmm.
it's not easy, Auggie.
and yet, you're here.
maybe he's just hungover, sleeping it off.
this is a guy who's never late for anything.
he knows the protocol. Auggie would've called in.
so what are you thinking?
well, that's not Auggie's.
the train? Really?
are you trying to make this as annoying as possible?
Ah. - Oh, step.
you don't like being stuck on the rails?
I remember us having an amazing time on the metro to crystal city.
we weren't running for our lives.
we are now.
what do you mean, he's out of pocket?
Auggie's not at his apartment, and it looks like Natasha Petrovna was.
okay, I'm attempting to trace the last known location of his cell phone.
don't bother, it's right here.
along with his keys and his I. D.
anything we could use to trace them is right here in front of us.
look, Auggie knows what he's doing, and we're not gonna find him unless...
DHS flags all cash transactions for transit tickets, right?
Yeah.
I need you guys to check all the stores around Auggie's apartment.
see if any of them activated a high value disposable credit card last night.
barber, are you there?
Yeah, I'm typing. [scoffs]
Oh, okay. Okay, here we go.
the gas-n-sip at 18th and Calvert activated two $500 cards last night at 1: 16 A. M. and one of them was used to buy tickets on Amtrak 3312 to Montreal this morning.
find a table near the middle. I need to hear.
I still don't know what you're looking for.
I'm looking for a passenger with a nexus immigration fast-pass card.
digital documents are easier to fake than paper.
here. - Here?
I'll just hack into the passenger manifests.
it'll be so much easier.
what, no. Tash, Tash.
I don't need the data. I need an actual card.
we'd be better going bag-to-bag to find the card.
and a blind guy and a smoking hot Russian girl looking through other people's bags wouldn't attract any attention?
it's better than you trying to divine a card using esp.
so are you gonna give me this hack?
is that what this is?
you're playing me to get my code for the CIA?
no, I'm trying to help you.
but I do still think you'd be better off entrusting it to the CIA, rather than everyone in the world.
a chef special with a side of back bacon.
and could I get another serviette?
Oh, and separate receipts, please.
that guy, what is he wearing?
green suit, ugly tie.
and what does that tell you?
he's a businessman with no style?
no, he's a Canadian businessman.
an American would've ordered ham or Canadian bacon.
he ordered back bacon, and she asked for a serviette.
take me over there. Follow my lead.
excuse us, folks.
we're with the transit company's hospitality department and we're conducting a survey to try and improve our level of service.
do you mind answering a couple of questions?
we'd be happy to. - Great, thank you.
okay, first question.
on a scale from one to eight, how would you rate your travel experience thus far?
next stop, Albany.
eight? - Yeah, it was great.
wonderful, I'm very happy to hear that.
the FBI is stopping the train at Albany.
I think Auggie wants us, not the FBI, to find him.
how else do you explain the scrabble board and the credit card scraps?
those are bread crumbs.
or he could've just been sloppy.
I think he's running Natasha.
or he's helping her get to Canada.
do you really think that?
Annie, you've only been here for a few months.
how well do you really know Auggie?
okay, regardless of which one of you is right, we need to get to him before the FBI does.
they're still furious at us for losing Natasha.
I want you two to follow this down.
got it, we'll liaise with the Albany office.
no, we're gonna keep this in -house.
go to the airfield.
no sign of the girl?
I had my nexus card when we got on the train.
somebody must've stolen it. [sigh]
it's got CIA written all over it.
nice work.
what do you know? You didn't see anything.
it sounded awesome.
current generation nexus immigration cards have a flaw in the way they were encrypted.
for some reason, the designers left sequential register scanning enabled.
if that's the case, I can parse the addressable memory for the encryption key, and we'll have full redirect capabilities.
I love it when you talk dirty.
how did you know to switch trains?
I've been doing this a long time.
protocol makes people predictable.
you used to be predictable.
uh, no. - Yes.
Yes. Yes, you were so buttoned down.
such a white hat.
what happened?
something unpredictable.
smile.
you didn't break up with me because the agency told you to.
Yes, I did. I can show you the memo.
Oh, please, Auggie. It's a notorious bureaucracy.
that memo probably came after you dumped me.
Wow. I thought I was kidding.
you were the one who didn't wanna move to D. C.
you didn't want a family, you didn't want kids, you didn't... Here we go.
Yes, yes, Tash. Here we go.
you come in and talk to me like I ruined your life, but dating you wasn't easy.
so why bother? - Because I...
because I loved you.
don't ask me to explain it.
I didn't know we had access to a jet.
why don't we fly this more often?
cause our title isn't "director.
we don't come back with Auggie, don't count on flying it again.
he wasn't on the train.
neither was Natasha.
look, I know what you're thinking.
that I'm an asshole for not trusting Auggie.
so you're a bit of a mind reader?
look, as hard as it may be for you to believe,
I do like Auggie.
but if I put my personal feelings ahead of analysis, then I'm not doing my job.
I trust Auggie.
and I respect that.
but in our business, we can't rely on trust alone.
if we're wrong about Auggie... I know I'm right.
let's assume you are right, he's running Natasha.
it is still a huge breach of protocol.
wait.
CIA protocol, always travel unpredictably.
Amtrak splits at Albany to both Montreal and Toronto.
you think they switched trains?
Yeah.
do you trust me?
I'll go talk to the pilot.
please remain in your compartments and have immigration documents ready, for passport control will be coming through the cabin.
thank you.
we're in.
we already showed our cards.
I'll get rid of them.
wait, Tash. Wait.
wait!
Tash, talk to me, how many?
how many?
two!
Tash, hit the lights.
hit the lights!
get dressed. Fast.
we're gonna have to jump.
we're gonna jump off a moving train?
we'll slow down at Niagara on the lake for coupling to the Canadian system.
the FBI will jump on then, and we'll jump off.
okay, the FBI will start at the ends and work their way in.
do you see anybody out there?
they're out there, they're coming.
good.
they can't set up on the eastern side because of the lake.
when you see the ops team coming in the back door, that's when we go.
I'm a big girl, Auggie. I can take it from here.
Tash, I couldn't help you before.
I am not abandoning you now.
what if I told you I couldn't give you the code?
if I didn't have it? Would you still help me?
Yes.
Yes, I want to help you.
that's the answer I wanted to hear.
this is the source code.
everything you need is right here.
I love you, Auggie.
Where's Natasha?
Jai, don't worry. I got the hack.
told you.
Hey, did you guys get to ride on the jet?
Where's the girl?
I didn't see anybody.
I know what you wanna hear.
that I knew Natasha had the hack the whole time and I was just playing her.
working her like an asset to get it back.
but the truth...
I don't know.
in order to be a good operative, you need to play on emotions.
and sometimes that means you have to become emotional yourself.
is that a compliment? - It is.
and just for variety, here's a threat to go along with it.
don't ever do what you did again.
have you heard from her?
no.
no, I don't imagine I'll ever talk to her again.
so...
was it worth it?
guess I am qualified for field work after all.
speaking of which...
I assume you are elliptically trying to get me to talk about Liza Hearn.
what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna get as much information as I can and then turn it all over to Joan.
and then I'm gonna end it.
okay?
it's okay with me if it's okay with you.
I trust you.
thank you.
you're not such a bad sister after all.
sorry.
let me see, let me see.
okay.
look, we're not gonna bust you If you say you're a... call girl.
we don't like to use that term.
Ben mercer-- we move too quickly.He could slip away again.
keep the girl working, keep her out there, and let's see what he does.
hopefully, she'll lead us right to him.
let him go, Annie. - You're right.
it's stupid. It's time to move on.
Hassan's down. - Who fired the shot?
the order was to take him alive.
who fired?
drop the weapon!
drop it now! Get on the ground!
I didn't-- I don't
put the gun down.
move away from the weapon and lie facedown.
I just heard.
where is she? The bureau's got her?
Yes. See, this is what happens, Arthur.
you put annie in harm's way, she gets harmed.
was Mercer involved?
do I need to authorize an ops team?
I have an operative in federal custody,
one who's lucky to be alive.
we can talk about you and your agenda when I get her back here safely.
I know you.
let's see, you're not dressed like a call girl.
who do you work for today?
the smithsonia - do you, now?
when I get back, we can do the "he said, she said" back-and-forth thing.
I'm not gonna like this, am I?
girl's lawyer is here. - Her lawyer?
you mean the one she didn't call,
because we didn't let her call anybody yet?
that's her. - Yeah, I got it.
I'd like to speak with my client, alone.
your client.
just understand that we expect
a little interagency communication and support.
right this way.
thank you. - You're welcome.
I said I was your lawyer.
did they buy it? - No.
but you might as well treat me like one,
because it's gonna be the same advice.
you're sitting in a federal interrogation room, Annie. Why?
I-I-- I didn't--- A blanket denialIs not gonna get you anywhere with them or with me.
I'm looking for a detailed, moment-by-moment explanation.
I've been trying to work it through. - Right. So you're confused, maybe in shock?
I understand.
so let's just work through it together.
take a deep breath and start at the beginning.
two days ago,
I attended an auction at Bramble's
as part of my smithsonian cover.
do I hear $500, 000?
thank you, ma'am. $500, 000.
do I hear $750, 000? $750, 000?
Sir,$750, 000. Thank you.
do I hear $1 million? $1 million?
thank you. Do I hear...
bidding on the, uh, velvet elvis?
Oh. I hear the brushwork's amazing.
Yeah. I'm holding out on the dogs playing poker.
there's a dogs playing poker? I'll have to add that to my list.
you bidding on multiple lots? - Yeah.
my resources are pretty good.
funded corporate viper.
we private buyers don't really care for your kind.
just don't go for the piece I'm after.
you better hope not.
fair warning and...
sold for $5. 75 million. Thank you, ma'am.
the Renoir is now closed for bidding.
next up is lot 33,
thomas cole's 1832 painting a wild scene.
we'll open bidding, please, at $1. 5 million.
$1. 5 million. Thank you, sir.
do I hear $1. 75 million?$1. 75 million.
thank you. Do I hear 2--$2 million?
$2 million. Thank you very much.
do I hear 2. 25?
don't look at me.
$2. 25 million, sir?
thank you. Do I hear 2. 5?
2. 5? $2. 5 million.
thank you. Do I hear 2. 75? 2.75?
two and three-quarter million dollars-- thank you very much.
do I hear 3-- $3 million?
$3 million, sir. Thank you very much.
do I hear 3. 25? 3. 25?
$10 million.
$10 million.
ladies and gentlemen, do I hear 10. 1?
$10. 1 million?
very well. Fair warning, and...
sold for $10 million. Thank you.
the cole is now closed for bidding.
that was a gross overbid.
excuse me, miss Jacklin? - Yes.
who was the man that bought the cole painting?
I-I'm sorry. We can't release personal information.
our bidders value their privacy.
I understand, but let me ask you--Wasn't that bid a little outrageous?
I think if you can pay outrageous, You can buy outrageous.
this happens from time to time.
Yeah, but the-- the painting was not worth that.
apparently, it was. Excuse me.
so if we see something that we don't think feels right,
the company wants us to report it, right, no matter how ridiculous?
encourages it, in fact. Why?
you see your gardener buying too much fertilizer?
somebody wanted me to watch a certain lot at bramble's this morning.
they even circled it on my lot schedule. - And...?
and the piece sold for way more than it was worth.
how much more?
$6, maybe $7 million.
file a civ ob.
may tick something in the server.
civilian observation-- right.
file a civ ob, catch the unabomber.
or a stupid art collector who pays too much for a painting.
Hey. We still on for tonight?
sure. But just to clarify, it's just a family barbecue
paper plates and paper napkins.
I totally understand what you're trying to say.
I'll dress casually.
so she was working at the smithsonian when you met her?
I- I'm confused. - Not exactly.
I wasn't at work. I was, uh...
actually, we met at a coffee shop near her work.
so... What is it you do, jai?
Ann says that you're some kind of a g-man or something.
I think that usually means the fbi.
no, I'm-- I'm just a suit-and-tie man for the state department.
I, uh, have a number instead of a name at work.
Oh, my god.
he's, like, the George Clooney of wherever he's from.
nice. He's actually third generation D. C.
but that bone structure is ridiculous.
okay, you're making me self-conscious here.
Oh, come on, you're one of the beautiful people too, which is why it works.
is it serious? - I don't know.
I haven't been on a date in a while.
Aha. Finally, she admits it.
it's a barbecue date.
it's not a serious date if everyone has hickory sauce on their chins.
Oh, come on, you can tell if has potential or not.
I'm not too much of a mom. I remember new romance...
sort of.
that was fun...
as far as barbecues go,
with paper napkins.
and paper plates? - Mm.
dates are so much fancier. - They are.
I appreciate the lack of pressure.
and I appreciate the understanding.
we've all had relationships that take time to get over.
are you talking about me?
you're a little gun-shy...
a lot gun-shy.
I guess I am.
all I'm saying is I've been there.
if you want to take your time, take your time.
I'm around.
there's nothing I like more than a good barbecue.
Hello, Annie.
I'm not sure whether I, uh...
apologize first for leaving you in Sri Lanka or...
breaking into your home.
sri Lanka.
leaving you was the hardest thing I ever had to do.
had to?
you changed things for me, Annie.
and you left me.
I was in love with you,
and you skipped out with a note.
if I would have stayed any longer, you would have been in danger. - From what?
my mission.
I was with the agency.
I knew it.
with stas on the train tracks...
it was you who saved me.
I was tracking him.
I'm on my own now.
and somehow that's my responsibility?- I was in love with you, Annie.
that was it.
I thought so long about what I would say to you if I ever saw you again,
and now I realize I don't want to talk.
I want you to talk. Why are you here? Now?
the cole painting at the auction.
you marked it on my program.
there's more there.
keep digging. Just push it hard.
what kind of cryptic nonsense is that?
you show up two years later out of the blue,
and you expect me to "push it hard"?
you push it hard.
I don't believe you.
there's an arms dealer...
Seref murat.
the auction is one of the ways he moves his money.
that's why that guy overbid so much.
Murat's number two, Russ Hilburn.
he wasn't just buying a thomas cole painting.
he was buying a cole and schematics for a Russian missile-guidance system.
that doesn't make sense. The cia would want to stop that.- Why--they want to control it.
they want to control him.
I want to stop Murat.
so just to be clear...
you're not asking for forgiveness.
you're asking me for a favor.
what do you want me do to?
go to Sophie Jacklin, the bramble's director.
ask her about February 22nd, lots 19 and 75.
it may take some coaxing, but I think she'll come into Langley with you.
and if you have to use my name, you use it.
you know her? - Call her Mona Lisa,
and she'll know you're not bluffing.
no.
I know this is a lot to take in.
the cia-- forget protocol.
the agency is using you to get to me.
you can't believe anything they say about me or anything I've done.
do not trust Joan and Arthur.
maybe I don't deserve this,
but I'm asking you to trust me.
trust the man you fell in love with in sri lanka.
I know that sound. Access denied.
someone's gonna throw a net over you in five, four...Three...
I mock your attempt at humor.
what, are you looking for Kennedy's assassin?
just blown password.
I'm checking on some stuff for Joan.
careful. The walls around here have eyes and ears.
try to avoid major felonies.
damn password. - At least turn down your speakers.
who called your attention to the auction? - Sophie Jacklin.
she called me yesterday morning.
and what did she say on the phone?
that she needed to see me, alone.
excuse me!
excuse me.
we're closed.
I-I need to speak to Miss Jacklin.
sorry. I - I haven't much time.
I'm Annie Walker. - From the smithsonian, yes.
you were upset about the price of the cole painting.
it was exorbitant.
like I told you, you know, people have their reasons.
I can't really guess why someone might bid what they bid.
what about February 22nd,
lots 19 and 75?
may I see your credentials, please?
I need another 15 minutes.
Yeah, well, make them wait. Something urgent's come up.
in my office. Yeah.
so, um...
lots 19 and 75 on...
was that the 22nd of February?
don't play games with me.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
do you want me to mention Murat?
maybe you should show me your other credentials now.
FBI? Interpol?
well, you can't be cia.
what makes you say that?
because they would have sent someone else.
so tell me, Annie Walker,
who the hell are you?
I'm not here to arrest you or kill you
or whatever you think.
put the gun down.
Oh, you just happen to be interestedIn those particular lots.
I know about Murat's deals
and Hilburn making the transactions.
that was him at the auction, wasn't it?
you must think I'm naive. - I was sent here to help you.
by whom?
you haven't told me anything yet.
I was sent by Ben Mercer.
Ben's dead.
I saw him last night.
I don't believe you.
believe me, Mona Lisa.
who was he to you?
he didn't tell you?
Ben has many secrets.
he was my contact at the agency.
he was the operative who first approached me.
I facilitated certain financial transactions for the company,
similar to what I do for hilburn and murat.
Ben made me feel safe, protected.
when they told me that he'd been killed, it wasn't the same anymore.
I felt exposed.
you started double dealing.
no, I-I was having some financial troubles,
and Russ Hilburn's money looked awfully good.
so why...
why didn't Ben come himself?
Ben's in a complicated situation.
and so are you.
it's the Russians who are selling the plans to Murat, right?
I don't know anything about any plans.
they don't tell me.
that's not gonna hold up when they start handing out indictments
or when Murat and Hilburn decide that you're the one causing this problem.
they'll kill me.
but they won't have the chance if you come with me to langley now, and tell us what you know.
we have to hurry.
um, Hilburn's men are on their way now to pick up the painting.
that's who you were with on the phone?- If you're here when they arrive, they
look, they're not the kind of men to waste time asking questions.
there's a side exit through the warehouse.
you always pack that much heat?
I don't even know if it works.
I guess what you said about Hilburn...
it's not the first timeI thought about what they might do to me.
Hello, Sophie.
something wrong?
the Cole is waiting for you in receiving.
you are supposed to be alone.
this is a friend of mine-- Annie.
she dropped by. - Which is why you're hurrying out with your gun.
I've never seen you with a weapon.
look, this must be some kind of misunderstanding.
miss Jacklin?
go, go, go!
the loading dock's through that way.
Hey, do you want this? - No, keep it.
keep moving towards the dock.
it works.
drop the weapon!
drop it now! Get on the ground!
I didn't-- I don't
put the gun down.
step away from the weapon and lie facedown.
Sophie jacklin tipped you to the overbid and then denied anything was wrong when you approached her afterwards?
she-- she was worried she was being watched.
she told you that.
when she called me... yesterday morning.
and what did she say on the phone?
that she needed to see me, alone.
so she knew who you worked for.
she didn't say, only that she had information for me about the buyer.
what did it say?
confirms two men at your shootout were Turkish, foreign nationals,
which is why you're in federal custody, not state.
find anything yet?
I'm in the middle of it now.
she deleted her history, tried to cover her tracks.
on a CIV ob?
it's not like Annie to work off book.
so Ms. Jacklin took you back to her office
and told you the buyer was paying for more than just a Thomas Cole.
the only reason you you hesitateIs because you're trying to handle me.
you do that, and you lose, Annie,
because I am much, much better at this than you.
just answer. What did she say?
it was a money exchange
for schematics for a Russian missile-guidance system.
if the Russians were the sellers, who were the Turks?
who was it that overbid for the Cole painting?
she didn't say.
she didn't say. Really?
after being such a fountain of information.
Sophie Jacklin was a cia asset.
she had been for six years.
did she bother, after all that,
telling you why she didn't contact her regular handler?
no, ma'am.
did she tell you who her first handler was?
no, ma'am, she didn't.
haven't got much here.
you get her search history restored?
working on it.
looks like she was diggingInto some pretty serious classified stuff.
Hey, have you ever run across anyone named Ben Mercer?
never heard of him.
uh, listen, I got to make another call.
I'll see you back at the shop. - Yeah.
wrong guy, annie.
Mm-hmm?
what exactly were you searching forIn the agency database?
art comps-- activity from the auction house.
I don't believe you.
I don't believe a single thing you've told me.
and as far as the feds out there are concerned,
you work for the smithsonian.
do you know what that means?
that means you are a citizen ripe for prosecution.
that means you are responsible for four bodies.
so unless you start opening up,
unless you start telling me the absolute truth,
I am gonna hang you out to dry, Annie.
believe me, I will.
tell me about Ben Mercer.
this is the day she was arrested?
Yeah, earlier--Before the place got all shot to hell.
MICK... That was my friend who died.
good man.
I'm sorry. - it's my fault.
I had a feeling she was trouble.
miss jacklin, she knew something was wrong.
watch this move here...
Ah. Bang.
should have pulled the trigger.
how much did you not disclose about Mercer during your initial with us?
why are you so interested in Ben?
because he is in this up to his eyeballs.
and is that why I was recruited by the agency?
have you seen him?
have you seen him?
Yes.
Annie went to Sophie, not the other way around.
nothing in the auction house database on who the buyer was.
Jacklin must have deleted it.
nothing in Annie's home either.
Auggie confirmed her looking into Mercer at the agency.
and she just admitted contact with him.
I still have four bodies that I have to account for.
so don't try and pull your spook magic and disappear the case from my docket.
I'm not finished talking with my client, Mr. Rossabi.
but I'm about to be.
no more games, Annie.
if there's a weapons plan in play,
you need to tell me everything you know.
who's the buyer?
believe me, whatever you think you know,
I promise you, it is not the whole truth.
Ben mercer is a liar who abandoned the agency.
you need to make a choice right now, Annie,
because this is it-- right now.
the name of the buyer,
or I will leave you here to be prosecuted.
I guess Annie opened up.
what do you think they're gonna do to her?
that's up to Joan.
how forgiving did she look?
you could tell as much as I could.
Ben Mercer was a cia operative.
he turned Sophie Jacklin six years ago and made her an asset.
that's it?
that's all you're gonna give me? I already knew that!
there is no quid pro quo, Annie.
I don't owe you anything.
after I-- after you what?
finally stopped lying, breaking protocol, and did your job?
you do understand that you could be fired or tried for treason for what you've done.
do you understand that?
he went rogue, Annie.
that's all that matters in the end.
you never answered my question.
are you using me to get to him?
is that why you recruited me?
we recruit people for all kinds of reasons.
what matters is how they perform in their duties once they're here.
if they don't perform, we'd let them go,
no matter why they were recruited.
so where do I stand?
what's my status here?
I thought I said to avoid major felonies.
I'm sorry, Auggie.
I didn't make things too hard for you, did I?
my problem is I like you,
so I'm always gonna try and cover for you,
which I now see is going to lead meStraight to potential treason.
if they would just be straight with me about Ben,
I could settle it in my own head.
what do you know about-- I can't, Annie.
even if I did know something, I can't.
so...
how bad was the fallout, anyway?
I have to report to fbi agent Rossabi.
it's part of my release and something about good will,
to help him with the bramble's shooter.
you know what that is, right?
a huge break.
don't kid yourself.
Joan must like you. - Ha! Right.
I can't stop thinking about Sophie.
I feel like it's my fault. - Hey, don't do that, Annie.
you can't shoulder that. Russ Hilburn killed her.
just tell me it gets easier.
when it does...
that's when you have to start worrying about yourself.
where do you keep your gun when you're being a museum curator?
I don't carry a gun. And I'm not a curator.
I'm in acquisitions.
is that a spook cover deal, or are you actually qualified for that?
Oh, I'm fully qualified.
want to quiz me?
you don't really have a badge to flash, do you?
I have a library card. It's like a badge.
it's badge-like.
agent Rossabi, fbi. You got a crime scene here?
not bad for a bunch of art majors.
you guys tore it up.
this is where the director went down.
for all intents and purposes, agent Rossabi,
she was in my custody.
Ah, it was the first time you lost someone on your watch.
can't let it take you down...
whether you're a cop or an art dealer.
a colleague of mine said that earlier.
it feels like something that people say to avoid the ugly feelings.
you got to own the ugly feelings. That's our responsibility.
you just don't get lost in the guilt.
can't afford it in our line of work.
that's 20 years' worth of my salary.
about-- it's about 20.
well, the bad guys left it teetering.
it was clearly teetering.
the cole painting's down here. - Great.
this is the one
standard issue switchblade?
see, I bet the smithsonian doesn't let you have these.
important enough to come back for.
what the hell?
he had to come and get it after your shootout, in the last 24 hours.
or the last five minutes.
you can't possibly view this as my fault.
I did exactly what you said
Interdepartmental... Whatever.
can I help it if it took us to what you guys are supposed to be finding?
no. - Do we have any other leads on where Hilburn might be headed,
any other intel?
nothing actionable yet.
what do you want me to do?
just...Go home.
go home and stay home for the rest of the night. Please.
Hello, smithsonian.
it's you... The guy from the auction.
you're Russ Hilburn.
the other guy-- oh, he's also on the payroll.
like to keep them guessing, just in case, well...
and you don't work for the smithsonian.
actually, I do.
but you file more than one tax return.
is that how you treat iconic american art?
it wasn't really about the piece so much as the packaging.
take her inland.
Dumping's not allowed in the harbor.
he said don't kill me in the harbor!
no. He said don't dump you here.
I can kill you wherever.
that's not really a fair fight.
have harbor patrol pick up Hilburn. He can't be more than a mile out.
Joan had you tail me?
I think it worked out.
she told me Mercer left her a matchbook
with Hilburn's slip number written on the inside cover.
she went after Hilburn herself-- no backup.
well, I think she thought mercer would be there, not Hilburn.
and you accuse me of putting her in harm's way.
my guess is Mercer thought annie would report it,
just like she did with the auction.
why write it on a matchbook?
he was probably trying to order the way things went down,
to make sure annie brought sophie here first to protect her.
can't say he accomplished that, did he?
sometimes men can be misguided when they think they're helping women.
we're not using Annie as bait anymore.
it's not your call.
as long as annie works for us, Mercer's gonna be keeping tabs on her.
Annie is in this, whether she wants to be or not.
see ya at home?
the entire hill looks like osmanthus flower cake!
stop nonsense!
will you ever starve back in the capital?
take it.
brother Gao, a bandit's hideout is found three miles ahead!
it's true! What a surprise!
legend has it that the Desert Camels have killed so many that even their blades have turned black.
predict it.
the west the will of God, the north the barbaric...
commander... let's hurry.
it is fortune or misfortune?
it's neither fortune or misfortune.
hey... come on!
go!
beauty...
are you hungry?
what would you like to eat?
congratulations, boss...
say it and I'll get you whatever you want!
Really?
really. My heart is now yours.
Hey, caught it.
it's on fire...
sneak attack! Chase them...
shoot!
come on! I'll take you away!
come on!
hold me tight!
sacrifice our lives!
for the sake of our parents!
spill our blood!
for the sake of our home!
walk a million miles!
and kill the bandits of the desert!
to save the beauty!
put on our golden armors!
they're back! They're back! General is back!
you're grown up!
we saved her halfway.
her parents are dead.
why disappeared?
someone's knocking the door?
open the door.
mistress!
mistress!
can't we just send him to an inn?
bullshit!
we're brothers.
and it's New Year.
who?
he's back.
you're all here.
miss Xiaowei.
it's so cold outside.
drink some hot water. - Give it to me!
have some osmanthus flower cakes!
okay, thank you.
Thanks, Miss Xiaowei.
brother Gao Xiang, drink while it's hot.
so attentive.
who is this man?
he...
right there!
general...
general...
general, are you okay?
why didn't you wait for us?
general...
have you gone mad?
hundreds of gangsters here!
you said we're all brothers who'd die together.
we must go home all alive!
I'll never lead you.
brother Yong - General... - Brother Yong.
general, are you okay...
general... - Brother Yong.
general...
Freeze!
you won't!
a soldier like you can't go as you wish!
this is desertion...
and the penalty is death!
No!
no...
get away!
leave me!
everybody, take care.
general... - Brother Yong.
have you contacted him?
no.
don't you want him to come back?
of course I do!
perhaps he can catch the guy...
who tore the man's heart out.
I just never thought he'd been dejected like this.
we're married already. How about letting him stay?
do you know?
I've been worried about you every day.
be careful.
I won't eat it. Go give others to share.
thank you, Miss Xiaowei.
really won't eat?
no, I won't.
then I'm going.
I've sliced them for you from six humans.
why killed so many? How to eat them all at once?
for you to choose. It's just a few.
I don't mean to feel bad for them.
but you've made a lot of work for Wang Sheng.
I hardly see him these days.
you can simply kill his wife!
you're so disgusting.
who is it from?
young master of Golden Restaurant.
that fatso.
and this?
foreman of the dyehouse.
he's ugly!
it's said that the uglier the human heart...
the better to be ultimate in black magic.
if you want a pretty heart, try Wang Sheng's one.
you're wasting your time.
we've been here for nearly three months.
he will love me.
I don't believe I'll lose to that stupid woman!
why don't you just be his concubine?
concubine? Why do I need to be?
what I want to be is his wife.
listen. I shall be Mrs. Wang.
so you want to give up your training?
I have plenty of time.
but your skin won't wait.
you need more hearts...
to keep your human skin from rotting.
sure! Therefore, I've got to find a way out so I can stop myself eating such gross!
not woken up yet?
no.
let me get you some tea.
Peirong. I haven't slept a wink for days.
Peirong... I've drunk too much!
brother Yong.
you've woken up.
sorry.
Thanks.
I'm going!
brother Yong.
hey brother,
it's New Year's Eve. At least stay...
with us for the...
no, thanks!
brother Yong, just wait a moment.
I've got something to return to you.
brother Yong, your sword.
wish you good luck.
I just wondered where you've gone.
so righteous that you haven't left me alone.
brother Yong...
we've just come to the commander's house to fine you!
stop it. Get me some food.
okay, okay...
give me...
brother Yong, where've you been for the last two years?
sure! Where?
brother Yong.
have you suddenly come back for anything?
what's happened here?
nothing...
waiter, any spare room?
Yes, sure...
please pay a deposit at the counter first, sir.
I'm leaving my horse here, and you think I'll run away?
okay, fine...
waiter, don't forget to look after my horse!
I will, I guarantee. Rest assured!
please pay a deposit first, sir.
I'm leaving my horse here...
and you think I'll run away?
take care of my horse!
I will!
take care, sir. Happy new year!
let's go.
take care, sir. Happy new year!
waiter, it's a big inn; nothing more than that.
not even a slice of meat?
they've all gone home for new year, so has the chef.
let it be... any wine?
sure... l'll take it now!
a bottle of best spring liquor!
sir, it's just sold out!
she's taken all the rest.
sir, please choose others.
come here. Be my guest!
please!
thank you.
waiter.
waiter, one more bottle!
waiter...
no need. Here.
I'll give this pair ofjade pendants to who you love!
don't be like that.
we always come back alive...
after each battle, don't we?
say it after I'm back.
brother Yong.
come on. Don't always cry!
smile. You look much prettier when you smile!
come on... smile! I will be back!
let's go!
we'll be back.
How're you doing?
where have you been the last two years?
you're here just to ask...
such dull questions?
I suspect if there's a demon in our house.
three months ago,
when Brother Sheng was back after encountering bandits in the desert, he rescued a young woman with nowhere to stay.
elder sister.
her names is Xiaowei.
she claimed to be daughter of Gao Kun, a wealthy silk businessman.
her parents were framed and killed by corrupt officials and she was sold to the bandits...
tell me.
so many people love Xiaowei. Who will she go for?
how do I guess what's in a woman's heart?
Suddently, there appeared an assassin in the city...
who tore out the hearts of so many.
even the city's magistrate ran away last night.
all the guards have hidden away.
no one dare patrol at night.
the new magistrate has not yet come.
but there can't be without law in the city.
brothers, we will now take charge of the city till the new magistrate takes up his post.
are you ready?
the assassin keeps killing. - Ready!
nobody can deal with it. - Go!
the only thing he can do is step up the patrols every night.
then some times later, people start to doubt if they're all the work of evil demons.
miss, try this hairpin. It's beautiful.
these are the pearl powder.
new arrival.
do you want to try it?
miss, what you want is this, right?
why should I buy this?
you have to!
I'll take them all.
you gotta put on makeup!
sure! I gotta put on makeup!
this way, please.
is she really an evil demon?
I can't help you.
let me find you a man of power!
stay back. Back off...
the Taoist priest is dead, with his heart digged out...
the killer is a big, tall guy.
I have told no one but only you and another guy.
he is the Taoist priest.
he called me to take Xiaowei to the Taoist temple but he was dead the very next day!
how horrible!
okay!
I promise you to take Xiaowei to the temple.
okay?
sister Peirong.
I've got you a spell.
it expels demons and gives you peace.
she gives it to you. Just put it on.
thank you.
let's go.
Xiaorou, hand me the medical kit!
Xiaowei is hurt!
sister.
you didn't hurt me. See, I'm fine!
Lmpossible! I clearly saw her wound!
What're you talking about?
she's not an evil demon, is she?
she's surely fun, and charming.
but how could she possibly be?
only you can tempt me.
I've sent you so many letters.
don't know if you got them.
what's up now?
now, she's become...
more friendly with everyone, and she's getting very close to Brother Sheng.
anyone knows you suspect she's a demon?
how dare I tell anyone else?
no one would believe me.
demon?
you don't believe me, either?
I do, of course!
when did I ever disbelieve you?
what do you want me to do?
find out the truth!
what if she's really not a demon?
then I'll admit I'm wrong.
please, Brother Yong!
any money?
find me if you don't have enough.
lend me some money.
no money? But you invited me for a drink!
you enjoyed it too, didn't you?
hurry up!
be careful.
didn't I say you should wait for me?
miss Xiaowei said...
master's irritated...
so we hurried to give the dishes.
let me do it.
sister-in-law.
sister-in-law.
mistress.
start the meal.
start the meal.
let me do it.
where have you just been?
everybody's waiting for you.
I've just...
brother Wang, don't be upset with her.
sister Peirong went to the beauty shop for some lavender to put under your pillow in a bag, so you can sleep well.
it's New Year now.
don't worry too much.
I know.
sister.
are you looking for this?
I must thank you today.
I'll give it to Brother Sheng.
I know who you've been to see.
I won't tell Brother Wang.
something is actually not what you think.
anyway,
I'll tell you more about us later.
it's good as long as you're happy.
have a rest.
I've made a box for you.
put the hearts inside and they'll be kept fresh.
just put it there.
brother Sheng asked me to draw the "heart-digger."
I must do it well.
remember that old fella surnamed Xia who chopped you?
isn't he dead?
his granddaughter is here in town.
damn it! Their family never let me go.
shall I kill her for you?
Yes.
don't smile.
no murderer smiles.
don't move!
you keep moving. How do I draw?
brother Yong, you should know something
the dead bodies whose hearts...
are removed are all here.
brother Sheng has run out of ideas, so our Wang's Squadron...
can only patrol every night.
wang's Squadron?
you've left for so long.
should we still call it "Pang's Squadron"?
Wow!
this man is a real pro!
so accurate that he dug out the heart...
in a single cut!
so I told Brother Sheng this couldn't be done by a human.
you really believe in demons?
if I were a yin yang master, I surely did...
a demon! A demon here!
look at yourself. You believe in any crap!
what do you not believe? Yin yang master!
also, I suspect one person.
the woman Brother Sheng brought here - Xiaowei.
don't you love her?
not for sure!
you suspect her?
the killing spree began once she arrived.
I really feel the evil "qi" from her!
with suspicious background... - Alright...
enough! You can set up a booth out there and fool the guys!
get off! You feel good staying in a coffin?
get off!
what he say is correct!
all done by evil demons!
I too think evil demons did these.
don't listen to her foolish talk! It's all nonsense!
what foolish talk? I've seen before!
there're many demons in this world.
Some're transformed from flowers, grasses and trees...
some from tigers, wolves, snakes, foxes...
and some from love and hatred...
some are good, some are bad... - Don't kid me!
demons kill with a sword?
why do humans kill humans for their hearts?
what's your name? You seem very sure.
my name is Xia Bing.
I'm a "Demon Buster."
my name is Pang Yong.
I don't believe in demons.
this sealed part of fox tail...
will direct us to the "Beautiful Fox from the Sky."
once it senses a fox spirit in the vicinity, it glares.
this is what brought me here.
I'm sure the demon is still in this city.
can you sense where the demon is?
within a ten-mile radius of here.
the entire city is only some ten miles long.
such a big range!
this is the last place!
I've spent all my money on the case.
the Taoist priest died right here!
also, all the murders occurred on the east side of the city.
look.
not only that. They all surrounded commander's house!
Exactly!
so what do we do next?
nothing to do with you.
miss, this is the official matter.
I think you needn't ask.
he doesn't work for the government, either!
nothing to do with you as well.
Hey, where're you going?
nothing to do with you!
hey...
I've used up my money!
are you okay?
you're that demon?
don't fool around!
you wanna run?
you so over there.
leave me alone! Get him!
waiter! Waiter!
stop shouting. It's new year's day. Everybody's gone.
do you come to drink or heal me?
don't panic. Just a small wound.
What're you doing?
why didn't you tell me you'd blow?
I had wine in my mouth. I couldn't tell you.
have you seen enough?
don't move.
what?
what... you...
softly... softly...
be quiet.
it's done by a sword!
can a demon use a sword?
who say they can't?
softly, softy...
how do you deal with them?
ordinary demons can be finished by a single slash.
what if they're not ordinary?
this is this "Demon Rod."
my grandpa told me that...
its power is beyond limit...
when it meets a capable person.
that person is surely not you!
I can't take it out.
not me, either.
I think your grandpa also couldn't.
sure! How do you know?
you don't believe my words?
Yes, yes. I dare not disbelieve!
don't get caught.
I must've killed the gal...
if it weren't for that drunk.
so she was really helped from her old lover.
put Master's clothes in!
no wonder she's getting bold!
the sun is great. Dry it in the sun!
miss Xiaowei, who's getting bold?
I didn't say anything.
I'm sorry.
I can't go to the beauty store with you...
coz mistress needs my help.
doesn't matter. You do your things.
I can go myself.
where did you go?
I... I just helped in the study...
you go to the kitchen, then.
Yes!
brother Yong, I've checked it.
there's a rich man called Gao Kun in another city.
the whole family died of a plague three years ago.
he doesn't have a daughter. This woman's lying.
Peirong, where's Xiaowei?
in the beauty shop.
brother Yong, what do you find her for?
she's not what she claims to be!
you've brought a demon home!
demon?
brother Yong, you do believe a rumor like this?
I just want to find out the truth.
truth. Fine.
I'll get you there and see the truth.
the Gao family has no daughter! Who are you?
xiahou Xiang is known to be wrong all the time!
has he misunderstood you?
that's right! Miss Xiaowei, just go ahead tell us your difficulties!
Xiaowei, don't be scared.
tell us everything!
I'm actually not the Gao family's daughter.
I'm only...
their maid.
but I love being with you...
and don't want you to look down upon me.
that's why I made up such that stupid story.
who else can verify what you said?
no.
we can!
we rescued her...
from the lair of the desert's bandits.
she'd have died if we it weren't for us!
Yes! Yes... - Sure! We rescued her...
brother Wang,
I did tell lies.
but please don't banish me! Will you?
I don't want to be alone.
get up.
with me here, nobody dare bully you.
I'll chop your hands off and see if you're a demon!
brother Yong!
What're you doing? Are you crazy?
I just tested her. It's the back of the blade!
I don't care what tricks you played. Xiaowei is my family!
your family... so what about Peirong?
Peirong is your wife! She's been worried about you every day!
brother Yong.
you still care that Peirong had chosen me!
bastard!
I'm not happy!
coz Peirong has chosen the wrong one!
you cold-hearted thing!
they're already married.
I think you'd better give up.
shut up!
obsessed by that woman!
you've never seen a woman?
pang Yong!
it's my private matter. It's none of yours!
I must care about the demon's case!
this is a section of tail from a fox spirit.
whenever a demon shows up, it glares.
it's always glaring. So we're all demons?
I'm a "Demon Buster." Everything I said is real!
I don't believe it. Who does?
the ghosts do!
I do!
I saw it with my own eyes!
she knows black magic.
I hurt her hand by accident and it healed up at once.
later I told this to the Taoist priest.
he said you're a demon with high power.
on the very next day, he died...
I've been staying with you. I know more than anyone else.
I have an idea!
there's a "mark" on each demon,
it's the sense of touch.
what?
any real city, you walk, you know?
you brush past people. People bump into you.
in L. A. nobody touches you.
we're always behind this metal and glass.
I think we miss that touch so much that we crash into each other just so we can feel something.
you guys okay?
I think he hit his head.
you don't think that's true?
stay in your car.
graham, I think we got rear-ended.
I think we spun around twice.
and somewhere in there, one of us lost our frame of reference.
and I'm gonna go look for it.
calm down, ma'am. - I am calm!
I need to see your registration and insurance.
Why? It's not my fault! It's her fault! She do this!
my fault?
ma'am, you really need to wait in your vehicle.
my fault?
stop in middle of street! Mexicans no know how to drive.
she "blake" too fast.
I "blake" too fast? I "blake" too fast.
I'm sorry you no see my "blake" lights. - Ma'am.
see, I stop when I see a long line of cars stopped in front of me.
maybe you see over steering wheel, you "blake" too!
ma'am!
I call immigration on you. Look what you do my car.
officer, can you please write in your report how shocked I am to be hit by an Asian driver!
ma'am! - Ma'am, no. See, Detective...
all right. You've got to calm down.
Hey, Detective! Nice entrance.
fuck you.
Hey, you okay?
I'm freezin'.
shit. I heard it might snow.
get outta here. - That's what I heard.
you got a smoke? - Nah. I quit.
Yeah, me too.
what do you got? - Dead kid.
Hey, Bob.
you get one free box of ammunition. What kind do you want?
yo, Osama! Plan a jihad on your own time.
what do you want?
are you making insult at me?
am I making insult "at" you? Is that the closest you can come to English?
Yes, I speak English! I am American citizen. - Oh, God, here we go.
I have right like you. I have right to buy gun.
not in my store, you don't! Andy, get him outta here now!
go wait in the car. - Now. Get out!
you're an ignorant man!
Yeah, I'm ignorant? You're liberating my country.
and I'm flying 747s into your mud huts and incinerating your friends?
get the fuck out! - No, you get the fuck out!
no, don't touch me! He cheat me!
Andy, now! - Let's go.
okay.
you can give me the gun or give me back the money.
and I am really hoping for the money.
what kind of ammunition do you want? - Whatever fits.
we got a lot of kinds.
we got long colts, short colts, bull heads, flat nose, hollow points, wide cutters, and a dozen more that'll fit any size hole.
just depends upon how much bang you can handle.
I'll take the ones in the red box.
you know what those are? - Can I have them?
did you see any white people waitin' an hour and 32 minutes for a plate of spaghetti?
and how many cups of coffee did we get?
you don't drink coffee and I didn't want any.
man, that woman poured cup after cup to every single white person around us.
but did she even ask you if you wanted any?
we didn't get any coffee that you didn't want and I didn't order, and that's evidence of racial discrimination?
did you notice that our waitress was black?
and black women don't think in stereotypes?
you tell me. When was the last time you met one who didn't think she knew everything about your lazy ass before you even opened your mouth, huh?
that waitress sized us up in two seconds.
we're black, and black people don't tip. She wasn't gonna waste her time.
somebody like that? Nothing you can do to change their mind.
how much did you leave?
you expect me to pay for that kind of service?
what? What the fuck is you laughin' at, man?
I'm seriously starting to think that you're jealous of Karen.
hardly. I'd just like to see you get through a meal without calling her or anyone else.
okay, no more phone calls. As a matter of fact, you can hold the battery.
okay?
ten bucks says she calls you in the car.
wait, wait, wait. See what that woman just did?
you see that? - She's cold.
she got colder as soon as she saw us.
Ah, come on, don't start. - Man, look around you, man.
you couldn't find a whiter, safer or better-lit part of this city right now.
but yet this white woman sees two black guys who look like UCLA students strolling down the sidewalk, and her reaction is blind fear?
look at us, dawg. Are we dressed like gangbangers?
huh? No. Do we look threatening? No.
fact. If anybody should be scared around here, it's us!
we're the only two black faces surrounded by a sea of over-caffeinated white people patrolled by the trigger-happy L. A. P D.
so you tell me. Why aren't we scared?
cause we got guns?
you could be right.
get the fuck outta the car! - Gimme the keys!
hurry up! Get down! - Okay, okay, okay, okay.
no, no! Please! - Don't look at me! Turn around!
come on! Go! - We're fine! just keep moving!
no, no, no! Take that voodoo-assed thing off of there right now.
I know you just didn't call Saint Christopher voodoo.
man's the patron saint of travelers, dawg.
you had a conversation with God, huh? What did God say?
go forth, my son, and leave big slobbery suction rings on every dashboard you find"?
why the hell do you do that?
look at the way your crazy ass drive, then ask me again.
Chevy pickup and Mercedes driving north on Balboa.
pickup cuts in front. Driver of the Mercedes gets pissed, pulls a gun.
doesn't realize the guy in the pickup is a cop coming off shift.
this Barry Gibb dude is a cop?
Yeah. Name's Conklin. He's a narc out of Wilshire.
I got the Mercedes.
Mercedes takes a shot at him. Detective Conklin returns fire. One shot.
Mercedes rolls to a stop. Driver opens the door, falls out dead.
he looks very relaxed for just having shot somebody.
he says he kept tryin' to drive away.
the Mercedes kept pulling up next to him, screaming, waving a gun.
shot back in self-defense.
anybody actually see who shot first? - They just heard two bangs.
find me a witness.
that is a nice gun.
the car's registered to a Cindy Bradley.
and that's not Cindy.
that is a William Lewis.
found under the front seat. Hollywood Division.
looks like Detective Conklin shot himself the wrong nigger.
how much longer are you gonna be? - This is the last one.
thank you.
you don't think reporters listen to police calls?
I need to talk to you for a second.
you just give me a minute, all right?
find Flanagan, will you? Now. - Yes, sir.
Yes, honey?
I want the locks changed again in the morning.
you want-- Why don't you just go lie down? Have you checked on james?
of course. I've checked on him every five minutes since we've been home.
do not patronize me. I want the locks changed again in the morning.
it's okay. just go to bed.
you know, didn't I just ask you not to treat me like a child?
I'm sorry, Miss jean. Is okay I go home now?
it's fine. Thank you very much for staying.
you're welcome. No problem. Good night.
good night. - We'll see you tomorrow.
I would like the locks changed again in the morning.
and you might mention that we'd appreciate it if next time they didn't send a gang member.
a gang member? You mean that kid in there? - Yes, yes.
Yes. The guy with the shaved head, the pants around his ass, the prison tattoo.
those are not prison tattoos. - Oh, really?
and he's not gonna sell our key to one of his gangbanger friends - the moment he is out our door? - We've had a tough night.
lt'd be best if you went upstairs... - And wait for them to break in?
I just had a gun pointed in my face.
you lower your voice!
and it was my fault because I knew it was gonna happen.
but if a white person sees two black men walking towards her, and she turns and walks in the other direction, she's a racist, right?
well, I got scared and I didn't say anything.
and ten seconds later I had a gun in my face!
I am telling you. Your amigo in there is gonna sell our key to one of his homies.
and this time it'd be really fucking great if you acted like you actually gave a shit!
all right, what have we got? Talk to me, Karen.
flanagan doesn't think anybody has the story yet.
I'm the goddamn District Attorney of Los Angeles.
if my car gets jacked, it's gonna make news.
fuck!
why did these guys have to be black?
I mean, why?
no matter how we spin this,
I'm either gonna lose the black vote or I'm gonna lose the law-and-order vote.
you're worrying too much. You have a lot of support in the black community.
all right. If we can't duck this thing, we're gonna have to neutralize it.
what we need is a picture of me pinning a medal on a black man.
Bruce?
the firefighter.
the one who saved the camp or something. Northridge. What's his name?
he's lraqi.
he's lraqi? Well, he looks black.
he's dark-skinned, sir, but he's lraqi. His name's Saddam Khahum.
Saddam? His-His name's Saddam?
that's real good, Bruce. I'm gonna pin a medal on an lraqi named Saddam.
give yourself a raise, will you?
it's been good doing business with you.
how soon can I have them? - I'm picking them up right now.
look, you're not listening to me. This is an emergency.
I keep telling you he's in pain. He can't sleep.
Mr. Ryan, your father has been to the clinic three times in the last month.
he is being treated for a urinary tract infection. That is by no means an emergency.
if you have any more questions about your HMO plan, why don't you make an appointment to come in between 1 0: 00 and 4: 00, Monday through Friday.
what does my father do about sleeping tonight?
I don't know. I'm not a doctor.
I wanna talk to your supervisor. - I am my supervisor!
what is your name? - Shaniqua johnson.
Shaniqua. Big fucking surprise that is.
Bronson Avenue, Westwood.
vehicle is described as a black late-model Lincoln Navigator.
california plate 4 Peter Charles Ida 31 5.
suspects are two black males, approximately 20 years of age.
that's not it.
that's not the vehicle, john. The plates don't match.
the driver's gotta be 40. Nobody jacks a car and takes it to Studio City.
they were doin' something.
enthusiastic.
keep your hands where I can see 'em, please.
I'm gonna need to see your driver's license and registration.
no problem.
I'm gonna have to reach inside the glove compartment to get the registration.
is that okay? - Nice and slow, please.
okay.
how are you tonight, Officer?
excellent.
here you go.
stay inside the vehicle, please.
let's do it again right now.
step outta the car, please, sir.
wait a minute, Officer. I haven't been drinking or anything.
then we shouldn't have a problem.
he doesn't drink. He's a Buddhist, for Christ's sake.
no, it's okay.
it's fine.
step onto the sidewalk, sir.
that's good. Right there.
look at me.
I want you to stand on your right foot.
touch your nose with the index finger of your left hand.
I told you he doesn't drink.
ma'am, I'm only gonna tell you one time to stay in the vehicle.
ma'am? - Honey, honey, I'm okay. I got this.
don't you "ma'am" me. Who the hell do you think you're talking to?
look, Officer, my wife has had a couple of drinks
both of you, turn around. Put your hands on top of your head and interlock your fingers.
wait. We're only a block away from our house.
hands on your head. Interlock your fingers.
hands on your head. Interlock your fingers. - I'm a television director.
me and my wife were just coming home from an awards show.
take your hands off him. He's done nothing wrong.
put your hands on top of your head, ma'am.
do what he says. - Fuck you!
put your hands...
and you keep your filthy fucking hands off me!
you motherfucking pig!
just stop talking! - That's quite a mouth you have.
of course you know that.
fuck you! That's what this is all about, isn't it?
you thought you saw a white woman blowin' a black man. That drove your cracker ass crazy.
will you just shut your fucking mouth!
I'd listen to your husband, ma'am.
put your legs open.
do you have any guns or knives or anything I might get stuck with?
I'm wearing a cocktail dress. What do you think?
you'd be surprised some of the places I've found weapons.
he's clean.
what do you think we should do about this, Mr. Thayer?
my partner and I just witnessed your wife performing fellatio on you while you were operating a motor vehicle.
that's reckless endangerment, which incidentally is a felony.
we could charge your wife with lewd conduct and performing a sexual act in public.
you say you're a block from home.
we could use our discretion and let you go with a warning, or we could cuff you and put you in the back of the car.
what do you think we should do, sir?
look, we're sorry, and we would appreciate if you would just let us go with a warning, please.
the man's apologizing, Tommy.
I think we can let him go. Don't you?
Yeah.
all right.
you can go.
you folks drive safe now, huh?
let's go, Tommy.
it won't close.
I can do that.
dad, you couldn't even get it open.
have respect for your father. Give me the gun!
here. Now you can shoot anybody you want.
Dorri, that man could've killed your mother.
you think I should let crazy people do what they want to us?
Farhad, it won't close.
Dorri, you should be at work.
who are you calling?
I'm gonna report their asses. Sons of bitches.
you actually believe they're gonna take anything you have to say seriously?
do you have any idea how that felt? To have that pig's hands all over me?
and you just stood there!
and then you apologized to him?
what did you want me to do? Get us both shot?
they were gonna shoot us on Ventura Boulevard! Pathetic.
well, maybe you would've been satisfied with just being arrested.
Oh, I get it. Much better to let him shove his hand up my crotch
you finally got me figured out, 'cause see, that's exactly what I was worried about right there.
Oh? You weren't afraid that all your good friends at the studio were gonna read about you in the morning and realize he's actually black?
you need to calm down right now.
what I need is a husband who will not just stand there while I am being molested!
they were cops for God sakes! They had guns!
maybe I should've let them arrest your ass.
sooner or later you gotta find out what it is really like to be black.
fuck you, man. Like you know.
the closest you ever came to being black, Cameron, was watching The Cosby Show.
at least I wasn't watching it with the rest of the equestrian team.
you're right, Cameron. I got a lot to learn 'cause I haven't quite learned how to shuck and jive.
let me hear it again. Thank you, mister policeman.
you sure is mighty kind to us poor black folk.
you be sure to let me know next time you wanna finger-fuck my wife.
how the fuck do you say something like that to me?
you know, fuck you!
that's good. A little anger. It's a bit late, but it's nice to see!
how's it goin'?
okay.
you didn't get scared or something, did you?
there's no monsters in the closet, right? 'Cause I hate monsters.
there's no such thing as monsters.
Ah, that's a good thing.
I heard a bang.
like a truck bang?
like a gun.
that's funny, 'cause we moved outta that bad neighborhood.
and there's not too many guns around here.
how far can bullets go?
they go pretty far.
but they usually get stuck in something and stop.
what if they don't?
you thinking about that bullet that came through your window?
you think we should move again?
I like it here.
me too. But if that bullet found out where we lived...
Oh, hold on.
what?
so stupid! How can I forget this?
what?
Nah. Forget it. You ain't gonna believe me.
tell me.
okay.
when I was five, this fairy came into my room one night.
right. - See, I told you you weren't gonna believe me.
okay, go to sleep now, you little rat. - No, tell me.
okay.
so this fairy comes into my room and I'm like, "Yeah, right, you're a fairy.
anyway, we're talking, you know.
and she's flying all around the room, knocking down all my posters and stuff.
she was flying?
she had these little stubby wings. She could've glued 'em on, you know?
like I'm gonna believe she's a fairy.
so she said, "I'll prove it.
so she reaches into her backpack.
and she pulls out this invisible cloak.
she ties it around my neck, and she tells me that it's impenetrable.
you know what impenetrable means?
it means that nothing can go through it.
no bullets. Nothing.
she told me that if I wore it, nothing would hurt me.
so I did. And my whole life, I never got shot, stabbed.
nothing. I mean, how weird is that?
only she told me that I was supposed to give it to my daughter on her fifth birthday.
and I forgot.
can I touch it?
sure, go ahead.
I don't feel it. - Yeah. It's pretty cool, huh?
I can take it off and tie it around your shoulders. She told me how to do it.
unless you think it's stupid. - Don't you need it?
no, not anymore.
so what do you think? You want it?
okay, let's get outta here.
okay.
put your head up.
okay. Is that too tight?
do you feel anything at all?
good. Then it's just right.
do I take it off when I have a bath?
no, you leave it on all the time.
until you have a daughter when she turns five, then you give it to her.
okay?
okay.
okay. Good night, sweetie.
good night.
Nah, nah. You wanna listen to music of the oppressor, you go right ahead, man.
how in the lunacy of your mind is hip-hop music of the oppressor?
listen to it, man! "Nigger this, nigger that.
you think white people go around calling each other honkies all day, man?
Hey, honky, how's business??"
going great, cracker. We're diversifying.
how 'bout this, huh? Listen. You like that? Man's singin' about lynchin' niggers.
and you think there's a difference, don't you? Huh?
gonna buy me a rope and lynch me a nigger
you have absolutely no idea where hip-hop music comes from, do you?
I'd shoot 'em dead first but I done broke my trigger
see, back in the '60s we had smart, articulate black men.
gonna get out my sheet put my hood on my head
like Huey Newton, Bobby Seale, Eldridge Cleaver, Fred Hampton.
gonna string 'em up good
these brothers were speaking out, and people were listening!
then they'll be dead
then the FBl said, "No, we can't have that.
home of the brave and the land of the free "Let's give the niggers this music by a bunch of mumbling idiots and sooner or later, they'll all copy it, and nobody will be able to understand a fucking word they say.
end of problem.
what the fuck was that, dawg?
holy shit! - What?
man, we done ran over a Chinaman.
you're sayin' there's a Chinaman under this truck?
what part don't you understand?
there's a Chinaman stuck underneath the fucking truck.
help me.
Ah, God. What the hell did he do, just leap out in front of the truck?
man! This is so completely fucked up.
Oh, really? No shit!
okay, hold up. Hold up, hold up, hold up.
get back in the truck. - What?
Yes, get back in the truck. - You think we didn't drag him far enough?
no, we gonna drive away. And he gonna let go.
he's not gonna let go, Anthony.
you know why? Because he's stuck underneath the fucking truck!
now, if he could've let go, he probably would've considered that option half a block back.
what you and I gotta do, just grab his arms and pull him from underneath.
you grab his arm, it's gonna fall off.
then you gonna be standing in the street holding a Chinaman's arm.
then what your ass gonna do, huh?
if we leave this man here, he dies. Then we're up for murder charges.
just grab his arm. We'll just pull him out.
I don't wanna cause any problems, Lieutenant. I just want a new partner.
I understand. Your partner's a racist prick.
but you don't wanna stir up any bad feelings with him.
he's been on the force for a long time.
seventeen years.
and I do have to work here, sir.
so you don't mind that there's a racist prick on the force.
you just don't want him to ride in your car.
if you need me to go on record about this, sir, I will.
that'd be great. Write a full report.
because I'm anxious to understand how an obvious bigot could've gone undetected in this department for 17 years.
eleven of which he was under my personal supervision.
which doesn't speak very highly of my managerial skills.
but that's not your concern. I can't wait to read it.
what if I said I wanted a new partner for personal reasons?
so now you're saying he's not a racist prick, you just don't like him.
Yes, sir. - That's not a good enough reason.
then I guess I should think of a better one and get back to you.
so you think I'm asking you to make one up.
uh, no, sir. I just can't think of one...right now.
you wanna know what I heard?
I heard it was a case of uncontrollable flatulence.
you want me to say he has flatulence?
not him. You. You have uncontrollable flatulence.
you're too embarrassed to ride with anybody else so you're requesting a one-man car.
I'm not...comfortable with that, Lieutenant.
I wouldn't be either. Which is why I understand your need for privacy.
just like I'm sure you understand how hard a black man has to work to get to, say, where I am, in a racist fucking organization like the L. A. P D.
and how easily that can be taken away.
now, that being said, it's your decision.
you can put your career and mine on the line in pursuit of a just cause, or you can admit to having an embarrassing problem of a personal nature.
fuck.
excuse me.
excuse me. Sir?
you finished?
I replaced the lock. But you got a real problem with that door.
you fix the lock?
Nah, I replaced the lock. But you gotta fix that door.
just fix the lock! - Sir, sir, sir. Listen to me.
what you need is a new door.
I need new door? - Yeah.
okay. How much?
I don't-- Sir, you're gonna have to call somebody that sells doors.
you try to cheat me, right? You have a friend that fix door?
Nah, I don't have a friend that fix doors, bro.
then go and fix the fucking lock, you cheater.
you-- You know what?
why don't you just pay for the lock and I won't charge you for the time.
you don't fix the lock! I pay! You think I'm stupid?
you fix the fucking lock, you cheater!
I'd appreciate if you'd stop calling me names. - Then fix the fucking lock!
I replaced the lock! You gotta fix the fucking door!
you cheat! You fucking cheater!
fine. Don't pay. - What?
have a good night. - What? No. Wait!
wait! You come back here! You fix the lock!
come here! You fix my lock!
fix the fucking lock!
I understand. You run over a Chinaman. Stuff him in the back.
then bring the truck here so I can share in the experience.
come on, man. It's a little bit of blood. It'll wash right off.
Georgie, burn this thing. - Burn it?
it's a brand-new Navigator. All you need is a little piece of carpet.
you watch the Discovery Channel?
not a lot. - They got some good shit on that channel.
every night there is a show with somebody shining a blue light and finding tiny specks of blood splattered on carpets and walls and ceiling fans, bathroom fixtures and special-edition plastic Burger King tray cups.
the next thing they show is some stupid redneck in handcuffs who looks absolutely stunned that this is happening to him.
sometimes the redneck is actually watching the Discovery Channel when they break in to arrest him.
and he still can't figure out how on earth they could've caught him!
do I look like I wanna be on the Discovery Channel?
no.
then get the fuck outta my shop.
Oh, yeah, make sure you get that.
without him, things could've gone really fucking wrong tonight.
fuck! - Don't! Don't you dare.
don't.
Graham Waters.
no. No, he's not here, Mom.
I'm not gonna go looking for him.
look, he'll be home when-- just leave it alone.
mom, I can't talk to you right now, okay? I'm having sex with a white woman.
okay, where were we?
I was white, and you were about to jerk off in the shower.
Oh, shit!
come on.
I would've said you were Mexican, but I don't think it would've pissed her off as much.
why do you keep everybody at a certain distance, huh?
what, you start to feel something and panic? - Come on, Maria.
you're just pissed 'cause I answered the phone.
that's just where I begin to get pissed.
I mean, really, what kind of man speaks to his mother that way?
Oh, this is about my mother. What do you know about my mother?
if I was your father, I'd kick your fucking ass.
okay. I was raised badly.
why don't you take your clothes off, get back into bed and teach me a lesson?
you want a lesson? I'll give you a lesson. How 'bout a geography lesson?
my father's from Puerto Rico. My mother's from El Salvador.
neither one of those is Mexico.
Ah. Then I guess the big mystery is who gathered all those remarkably different cultures together and taught them all how to park their cars on their lawns?
pop, you okay?
if I could piss, I'd be okay.
I'm-- jesus.
I'm done now.
give me a hand.
wait a goddamn minute!
wait a minute. - Whoa, whoa, whoa.
all right. Okay. Okay.
wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop!
I gotta go back. - Okay.
what, are you gonna stand there and stare at me?
so Conklin just shot him? - Mm-hmm.
they know each other? - Sir.
it's a grudge thing?
not as far as we can tell.
you think this is racially motivated?
well, a dozen people heard the shots. Nobody saw anything.
who do we have on it? - Graham Waters.
waters. All right. Well, tell him he speaks to no one but me.
call a press conference for 4: 00, and I want Waters here at 3: 30.
and would someone please find Flanagan.
Oh! What up, Mo Phat?
man robs purses from old ladies and you, "Hey, how's it goin', Mo Phat??"'
that nigger will steal teeth from a cripple, man.
you callin' him a thief? And we do what?
the man steals from black people.
only reason black people steal from their own is 'cause they terrified of white people.
Oh, man, please.
think about it. Sherman Oaks. Burbank. Santa Monica.
all scary-ass places for a brother to find himself.
drop Mo Phat at a Starbucks in Toluca Lake, that nigger will run like a rabbit soon as somebody say "decaf latte.
what the fuck did you do to my car?
sorry I take your car, Miss jean.
I turn key to my car, but nothing.
James wanted to take this to school.
but I don't want the kids to fight over it.
are these clean or dirty? - All clean, senora!
you know, Maria, just once I would like to wake up and find these dishes in the cabinet.
Si, senora. No problem.
I'm startin' to understand now.
by your work, you're settin' an example for our neighborhood.
sort of like a big brother kind of thing, right?
Yeah, you laugh, man.
but you have never seen me steal from a black person ever in your life.
what the hell do you think you doin' right now, man?
Wavin' down the bus.
put your hand down, dawg! Are you outta your mind?
you actually expect me to get on a bus?
no. I was hopin' we could push your car across town.
you know why? 'Cause we just don't do stuff like that no more.
you have no idea, do you?
you have no idea why they put them great big windows on the sides of buses, do you?
Why? - One reason only.
to humiliate the people of color who are reduced to ridin' on 'em.
I didn't know that.
you could fill the Staples Center with what you don't know.
you know the Kings are playin' tonight.
you don't like hockey! The only reason you say you do is to piss me off!
I love hockey.
cut! Print. Moving on.
okay, that takes us into scene 1 2.
okay, that takes us into scene 1 2.
jamal, that's what I'm talking about.
right on.
cam, you got a second? - Yeah, Fred, I just wanna grab some coffee.
Yeah. Listen. I think we need another take, buddy.
that looked pretty terrific, man.
this is gonna sound strange, but is jamal seeing a speech coach or something?
what do you mean?
have you noticed, uh-- This is weird for a white guy to say, but have you noticed he's talking a lot less black lately?
no, I haven't noticed that.
Really? Like in this scene, he was supposed to say, "Don't be talkin' 'bout that.
and he changed it to, "Don't talk to me about that.
wait a minute.
you think because of that, the audience won't recognize him as being a black man?
come on!
is there a problem, Cam?
excuse me?
is there a problem, Cam?
no, we don't have a problem.
I mean, 'cause all I'm saying is it's not his character.
Eddie's supposed to be the smart one, not jamal, right?
you're the expert here. But to me, it rings false.
we're gonna do it one more time. - Thanks, buddy.
everybody back. Let's do it one more time.
jamal, um...
morning, Carol. Who do I have?
hold for a minute, please.
Mr. Trujillo called and cancelled, but you have a walk-in, Mr. Ryan.
send him in.
Mr. Ryan. - Yeah.
my name is Shaniqua johnson.
I believe we spoke last night.
Oh, yeah. I wanted to apologize about that.
I haven't been gettin' too much sleep. My father's in a lot of pain.
Oh! I'm sorry to hear that.
this doctor he's been seein' says he's got a urinary tract infection.
but he's been takin' this medicine for a month, and he keeps gettin' worse.
and he's been back to see Dr. Robertson?
Yeah. Between you and me, the man's an idiot.
Really? - No offense.
but the guy sees 1 00 patients an hour. I think his nurses are doing most of the work.
Mmm. If you're unhappy, your father's welcome to see a doctor outside the network.
and if this new doctor says it's not an infection, says it's his prostate and it needs to be operated on, is that gonna be covered?
not unless Dr. Robertson authorizes-- - What good is that gonna do?
I'm sorry. There's nothing else I can do.
all right. You know what I can't do?
I can't look at you without thinking about the five or six more qualified white men who didn't get your job.
it's time for you to go.
I'm saying this 'cause I'm hoping that I'm wrong about you.
I'm hoping that someone like yourself, someone who may have been given a helping hand, might have a little compassion for someone in a similar situation.
Carol, I need security in my office!
you don't like me, that's fine. I'm a prick.
my father doesn't deserve to suffer like this.
he was a janitor. He struggled his whole life.
saved enough to start his own company.
twenty-three employees, all of them black.
paid 'em equal wages when no one else was doing that.
for 30 years he worked side by side with those men, sweeping and carrying garbage.
then the city council decides to give minority-owned companies preference in city contracts.
and overnight, my father loses everything.
his business, his home, his wife. Everything!
not once does he blame your people.
I'm not asking you to help me.
I'm asking that you do this small thing for a man who lost everything so people like yourself could reap the benefits.
and do you know what it's gonna cost you?
nothing.
just a flick of your pen.
your father sounds like a good man.
and if he'd come in here today, I probably would've approved this request.
but he didn't come in. You did. And for his sake, it's a real shame.
get him the hell outta my office.
sir, I spoke to our employee, and he told you you needed to replace or repair the door.
he say he fix the lock.
you come here, see how "fix-ed" it is! - You're yelling again.
I am not yelling! I'm upset!
yes-- Yes, I am.
mom, are you all right?
stop washing. Insurance must take picture.
okay?
look what they wrote.
they think we're Arab.
when did Persian become Arab?
I want his name. Yes.
Oh, my God.
I want his name! Give me his name! - Dad?
I'm not giving you his name, sir.
dad, did they take the gun? - Not fix my lock! I want his name!
I'm gonna hang up now, sir.
don't hang up! Shit!
Oh, thank God.
mom?
mom, it's cold. Come on.
did you find your brother?
no, Mom.
I was doin' good.
I was-- I was doin' real good.
I know, Mom. - I was doin'...
it's okay.
did you find your brother?
no, Mom.
tell him to come home.
tell him I'm not mad, okay? Okay, baby?
okay, Mom.
okay, baby.
okay.
okay.
did you apologize to your mother? - She wasn't there.
internal Affairs called. Found something in the Mercedes.
that's lunch. One hour.
I tried to call.
sounded like you're havin' a bad day, huh?
Yeah.
what?
I got scared, Cam.
it's not like I haven't been pulled over before. You know?
but not like that.
and, yes, I was a little drunk.
and I was mouthing off.
I'm sorry.
but when that man was putting his hands on me...
I don't wanna talk about it.
I can't believe you let him do that, baby.
look, I know what you did was the right thing. Okay?
but I was humiliated!
for you.
I just couldn't stand to see that man take away your dignity.
Yeah. That's what happened.
Oh, baby, don't do this. - No. No, you're right.
I ain't doin' it.
you gonna walk away from me?
Cameron! - just go home.
I understand.
Thanks.
has your father read his policy? - He doesn't read English.
Mr. Golzari, you said you called the locksmith?
Yes. I tell him, fix it.
they said their man told you to fix the door, and you didn't do so.
are you saying it's his fault?
insurance company is calling it negligence. They're not covering any of this.
no. This store is all we have.
I really am sorry.
what time you must go to work?
not until tonight.
go home and sleep.
it's okay. It's okay. Go home and sleep.
Hey.
maybe they didn't tell you, but I've been reassigned.
Yeah, they told me.
I just wanted to say, good luck and it was good ridin' with you.
you too.
wait till you've been on the job a few more years.
Yeah. - Look at me, look at me.
wait till you've been doin' it a little longer.
you think you know who you are, hmm?
you have no idea.
yo, Gomez, you ready to roll, homie?
ready, amigo.
radio check, 2-1-L-2-3.
2-1-L-23, picking up screams and noises from your car.
21-L, is your mike open by any chance?
call it in.
ma'am?
can you hear me?
paramedics are rolling. They'll be here in two minutes.
get an extinguisher, and get that fire out. - jesus.
ma'am, are you hurt?
can you move? - l-- I can't breathe.
okay, I'm gonna get you out.
it's okay.
okay. Okay.
okay, I'm gonna get you out.
No!
it's okay. - Get away from me!
get away. Stay away from me!
not you! Not you!
it's okay. - Don't touch me! Don't touch me!
keep away from me! - Lady, I'm tryin'-- I'm tryin' to help you.
fuck you! Not you!
somebody! Anybody else!
please, somebody! Not you! - Stop moving!
No! Get your filthy fucking hands off me!
stop moving. Lady, I'm not gonna fucking hurt you!
okay. Okay.
please don't touch me. Don't, don't.
I'm not gonna touch you. But there's nobody else here yet and that's gasoline there.
we need to get you outta here right away. Okay?
Oh, my-- Oh, my-- Oh, my-- Oh, my God.
okay. I need to reach across your lap. Can I do that, please?
Yeah. Yeah.
Thanks.
is anything broken?
I-I don't think so.
okay. Then that's good.
are you-- Are you gonna get me out?
Yeah, I'm gonna get you out. Okay?
look at me. Look at me. I'm gonna get you out.
Oh, fuck!
I'm sorry. - That's okay.
I'm gonna have to cut your belt, okay?
I'm gonna have to cut the belt.
it's okay, it's okay.
it's okay. Okay, we're gonna get you out.
everything's gonna be fine. Look at me!
everything's gonna be fine. We're gonna get you outta here.
everything's gonna be fine.
pull!
it's okay.
it's okay.
all right. It's okay, it's okay.
it's all right. I got it. I got it.
ma'am? Ma'am, can you walk with me?
it's cool, it's cool.
here we go. All right, you're doin' great.
the D. A. wanted me to apologize. He really wanted to be here himself.
no, he didn't! If he did his own dirty work none of us would have jobs.
Jake Flanagan. I work with Rick. - Graham Waters.
thanks for coming in. - He just pulled into the garage.
great. Press conference is in ten minutes, so we'll make this short.
internal Affairs says this Conklin has two suspicious shootings on his record.
both black men. Both times he was cleared, but only just.
detective Lewis makes black man number three.
you know any reason why we shouldn't hang Conklin for this?
well, it's more complicated than we originally thought.
we found $300, 000 in the trunk of the car that Detective Lewis was driving.
shit!
Ah. Go down to the garage. Tell him to stay in the car until he hears from me.
you found the money in the Mercedes. I thought that wasn't his car.
the car's registered to a Cindy Bradley. We haven't been able to get in touch with her.
apparently she, uh, left town this morning.
so it wasn't Lewis's car. He may not have known the money was in it.
you really think you're gonna be able to make that fly?
give us a minute.
no problem.
who knows about the money?
you gotta be kiddin' me.
there are only two people in this room.
myself, my partner, Ferguson and lnternal Affairs.
Jim Ferguson? - Yeah.
okay. I guess I don't see a problem.
as it wasn't Lewis's car, the money isn't clear evidence of any wrongdoing.
and even if it was, we aren't going to prosecute a dead man.
which means the money lnternal Affairs is holding can't be considered evidence.
you can do this dance if you want to, but I'm willing to bet when the coroner's report comes back tomorrow it's going to say that Detective Lewis was coked out of his head.
fucking black people, huh?
what did you just say?
I mean,
I know all the sociological reasons why per capita eight times more black men are incarcerated than white men.
schools are a disgrace. Lack of opportunity. Bias in the judicial system.
all that stuff. All that stuff!
but still, it's gotta get to you, on a gut level as a black man, they just can't keep their hands out of the cookie jar.
of course, you and l know that's not the truth.
but that's the way it always plays, doesn't it?
and assholes like Lewis keep feeding the flames. It's gotta get to you.
what did you say you did for the D. A. again?
you coach ball down in Compton. Am I right?
Oh, please, don't do that.
don't act like you know something about me, okay?
what do you think those kids need... to make them believe, to give them hope?
you think they need another drug-dealing cop or do you think they need a fallen black hero?
why don't you cut through the bullshit and just tell me what it is you want.
the D. A.'s squad loses its lead investigator next month.
Rick is quite adamant that his replacement be a person of color.
it's a high-profile position, and he wants to send the right message to the community.
and the right message is, "Look at this black boy I just bought??"'
well, fuck you very much. But thanks for thinking of me.
actually we were thinking of you.
until we saw that.
it's your brother's file.
twenty-something years old and already three felonies.
three strikes law. Kid's going away for life for stealing a car.
Christ, that's a shitty law.
there's a warrant in there.
but still, hey, he had every opportunity you had.
fucking black people, huh?
so all, uh-- all I need to do to make this disappear is to frame a potentially innocent man?
what are you? The fucking defender of all things white?
we're talking about a white man who shot three black men.
and you're arguing with me that maybe we're not being fair to him?
you know what? Maybe you're right. Maybe Lewis did provoke this.
and maybe he got exactly what was coming to him.
or maybe stoned or not, just being a black man in the Valley was enough to get him killed.
there was no one there to see who shot first, so there is no way to know.
which means we could get this wrong.
maybe that's what happened with your brother. Maybe we got it wrong.
maybe Lewis isn't the only one who deserves the benefit of the doubt.
you're the one closest to all this.
you need to tell us.
what does your gut tell you?
so? Graham?
what do I tell 'em?
you tell me, and I'll tell them.
well, I think given Detective Conklin's history, it's pretty clear what happened last night.
okay.
before I get to why we're here,
I know that many of you have heard we had our car stolen last night.
and as you could imagine, my wife and l are both pretty shaken up.
but we're okay.
and jean and I truly appreciate all your calls and your concern. Thank you.
now, just after 9: 00 p. m. Iast night, Detective William Lewis, an eight-year veteran of the force and an active member of the black community, was gunned down by a fellow officer.

he's not gonna shoot you, me, or anybody else, all right?
so give me two goddamn seconds. Can you do that?
lower your firearm. Lower your firearm!
you startin' to understand the situation?
what do you want from me?
unless you think your wife is better off with a husband who has a bloody stump for a head,
I want you to sit on that curb, put your hands on your head and do nothing until I speak with these officers.
I'm not sittin' on no curb, I'm not puttin' my hands on my head for nobody.
then stand where you are and keep your hands in sight. Can you do that, huh?
Yeah, I can do that.
good.
I told this man to stay where he is and keep his hands in plain sight.
this man better be related to you by blood because this is fucking nuts.
I need this favor.
you can check the guy's name, his license. He's got no priors, no warrants.
I need to let him go with a warning.
what kind of fucking warning? - A harsh warning.
thank you.
you've been warned. Do you understand me? Do you understand me!
you want something from me? 'Cause I'm right here.
I'm trying to help you. - I didn't ask for your help, did l?

Yeah, that I can do.

he doesn't have it. - Hasn't got what?
I have it. He doesn't have the impenetrable cloak!
Lara, stay outta the street!
it's okay, Daddy. - What-- What?
I'll protect you.
it's okay. Daddy's okay.
it's a really good cloak.
I sent her out for groceries, and that was two hours ago, Carol.

I'm not snapping at you! I am angry.
Yes! At them! Yes!
at them, the police, at Rick, at Maria, at the dry cleaners who destroyed another blouse today, at the gardener who keeps overwatering the lawn.
I...
I just thought that...
Carol, I just thought that I would wake up today and I would feel better, you know?
but I was still mad. And I realized
I realized that it had nothing to do with my car being stolen.
I wake up like this every morning!
I am angry all the time, and I don't know why.
Carol, I don't know why! And l...
Yeah, yeah, call me back.

Carol was the only one that was home and she said she couldn't come get me because she was getting a massage.

I'll be there soon.
I love you.

I've been loved and I've been alone
all my life I've been a rollin' stone
done everything that a man can do
everything but get a hold on you
done everything that a man can do
everything but get a hold on you
Oh. Jack, you bastard.
fuckin' bowling alley.
shit.
Jesus God.
I'm proud to meet you, sir. Hey there.
I've been listening to you for a hell of a long time.
did you have a good trip? Long, but good. Yeah.
played Clovis, New Mexico, last night.
I saw some pretty country. Glad to be here.
well, down there is the bandstand.
I'll catch up with you later, but sure is good to have you, Bad.
makes my day. And there's no smokin' in the alley, but you can sure finish that one.
I'll take a McClure's up with a beer back, darlin'.
4. 75.
Oh, it's on the tab. No tab.
I'm Bad Blake, darlin'. I'm Well, hell, I am the band.
Jimmy. Tab?
Mr. Blake.
we have a real nice room for you over at the Starlight Inn, and, of course, all your meals are taken care of, but, uh
I'm afraid we can't let you run a bar tab.
it's in the contract. Damn.
Mr. Greene of Greene & Gold, he put that in himself.
did he? Yes, sir.
well, if you and Jack have an agreement, we're gonna have to stick with that.
but don't you worry yourself about it.
how much? 4. 75.
Mr. Blake, let me personally offer you all the free bowling you want.
hold that, would you please?
Yes, sir.
Hey, Bad, this is Jack.
listen, I didn't wanna tell you this till you came off this swing, but
the label cut So Sweet, So Bad.
huh? Why, that fucker's still sellin'.
well, it was slowin' down a lot. You know what?
chains don't want it anymore.
plus Tommy Sweet's got nine albums out there now.
what about his new album?
I'm gonna get off the road here in a couple weeks.
I can get right to it.
Tommy wants to know if you got any new material.
Oh, shit. New material. You know I don't have any new material.
nothin' wrong with the old stuff.
Tommy thinks he's leaning too heavy on the old stuff.
he doesn't want people to think he's riding the gravy train.
that son of a bitch. He has a lifetime pass on the gravy train.
Hey, Bad, who's asking who for a record here?
Jack, you jerk-off.
you get your ass out here to Clovis-goddamn-New Mexico, you play in the piano bar of some fuckin' bowling alley, get up the next morning at 5: 00 and drive 300 miles...
with hemorrhoids so bad feels like you got a nest of fire ants up your ass, then you tell me about the gravy train.
you and Mr. World Famous Tommy Sweet both of you try that sometime.
why don't you sit down and write some songs, huh?
keep talkin'. Keep talkin'.
Jesus God! What's the matter? Can't do it anymore?
I'm tired of listening to your griping at everything.
you're capable of it. Jack.
you keep goin' out every fuckin' night drinking.
Hey, hey, hey. Listen to me.
I'm 57 years old.
I'm broke. I got $10 in my pocket.
I sent you money when you were still in Texas.
so spend it wisely, my friend. Yeah. Fuck you. Good-bye.
here we go.
all right, thank you. Thanks a lot.
Mr. Blake?
Oh.
I'll be goddamned-go-to-hell. It really is you, ain't it?
I can't believe it Bad Blake right here in my store.
I'm Bill Wilson. I'm a big fan of yours.
here you go. Here you go. Here's your McClure's.
I try to keep track of what all the stars drink.
Hey, you know what?
my wife, Beverly she is one of your biggest fans.
she'd flat-out die if she knew you were here. Mmm.
but we're goin' to the show tonight.
and if you could sing "I Don't Know" for Beverly
you got it. It'd mean the world to her.
I Don't Know" for Beverly. Yes, sir, old buddy, you can count on it.
Oh, hey, come here. Come here.
I wanna be able to tell everyone...
that I bought Bad Blake a drink.
you're kidding me. No.
why, thank you.
Hey. "I Don't Know" for Beverly... and Bill.
Yes.

Hey, Mr. Blake. I'm Tony.

Oh. Yeah, of course. Oh.
uh, me and the boys are settin' up over at the alley...
and was wonderin' what time to start rehearsin'.
why, just as soon as you can and as often as you can.
that's the secret. UhUm, Mr. Blake?
Mr. Blake?
sorry to bother you.
um, I was just wonderin' what time you were comin' over.
come here.
Yeah, I got somesome lead sheets here if y'all can read music.
chord charts if you can't.
here. Take this CD. That's for you.
here's your whole kit. And there's a playlist in there.
watch your hand.
all right, I'm gonna meet you over there.
you guys go on. Uh, Mr. Blake?
it'd really mean a lot to us if you come over a little early
and we got to go over some leads.
lead? Son, are they paying you more than they're paying me?
I just thought maybe you could show us some of that old stuff...
like Bad's Boys used to do.
you taught Tommy Sweet how to play guitar, didn't you?
listen to the CD. Listen good, and, uh, go over those lead sheets.
I'll be over there in about an hour. I'm gonna grab some supper.
all right. Well, thank you, Mr. Blake. Appreciate it.
thought you weren't gonna show.
son, I've played sick, drunk, divorced and on the run.
bad Blake hasn't missed a goddamn show in his whole fuckin' life.
now I'm playin' a fuckin' bowling alley backed by a bunch of hippies.
Ah. You sure they ain't paying you more than they're paying me?

we're back on.

it goes out especially to my dear friends Bill and Beverly.
God bless ya.

"bad," buddy. "Bad." What can I do for you?
you know, I hate to impose, especially since we just met.
but, see, I got this niece, and she's a writer.
she's tryin' to be a writer. She writes local here in Santa Fe.
I mean, it's not the New York Times or anything, but anyway
she writes about music, and she would love to do an interview with you.

he couldn't play a lick on it.
I, you know, picked it up, started foolin' with it.

bunch of people you probably never heard of.
Lulu Belle and Scotty, Emmett Miller.
georgia Wildcats. You ever hear of them?

we all owe our existence to them Delta boys.
you ever want to do anything else?

I was pretty good, too, you know, for a while there.
I couldn't hit the curveball.
well, I just figured I'd stick with the guitar, you know?
son of a bitch stayed where he was supposed to.
how about you? You always wanna be a writer?
I didn't know what I wanted for a long time.
but now you do?
well, now I know what I don't want to do again.
Yeah. Amen.

right. What's your real name?
I'm Bad Blake.
I wasn't born Bad.
when I die, my tombstone will have my real name on it.

it's an awful long time for people to have to wait to find out.
Mmm. Maybe, maybe not.
you a daddy? You got any kids?
sweetie, I'm gonna have to start gettin' goin' here.
all right. Can you give me just another half an hour after the show?
well, let's see how it goes, huh?
I appreciate you having to do your work. I understand that.

so, Wesley's, uh, what, your cousin?
he's my uncle. Oh.
that boy sure can play piano.
all right. Thank you. All right now.
was goin' where I shouldn't go
seein' who I shouldn't see
doin' what I shouldn't do
bein' who I shouldn't be
I never meant to hurt no one
I just had to have my way
if there's such a thing as too much fun
this must be the price you pay
it's funny how fallin' feels like flyin'
for a little while
funny how fallin' feels like flyin'
for a little while
you never see it comin' till it's gone
it all happens for a reason
even when it's wrong
especially when it's wrong
Wesley!
Hey. All right.
you.you were wonderful. Oh.
you haven't lost anything. Why, thank you.
I think you might be better than you were back then.
I'm Ann.
Hi, Ann. Hi.
I...I have, uh, loved country music my whole life. Have you?
Yeah. I even know the "B" sides of your albums.
Oh, that's better than me.
I was thinking, if you weren't doing anything after the show tonight, we could get a late dinner... or cup of coffee.
well, I would, but I promised a reporter an interview.
that's all right.
I know you're in town for another night.
another time would be fine.
I gotta get back to work.
uh, could you play "Get a Hold on You" for me?
I'd love to right now.
thank you, Santa Fe.
I'll be here one more night.
this goes out to Ann.
I've been loved and I've been alone
all my life I've been a rollin' stone
done everything that a man can do
everything but get a hold on you
so, how did you
you played a gospel song in a bar. I did.
how'd you get away with that? How'd you know?
if you'd been doin' it as long as I have, you'd know those things.
here you go. All right.
Cheers.
what else you wanna know? Records.
what's your favorite?
Oh, I've have to say "Falling and Flying."
it made me a lot of money, that song. Turned my whole life around.
you get tired of playing it?
when I have to play it twice, three times a night.
but, you know, it's been too good to me.
can't turn my back on it.
so, in today's world of artificial country music, who's real country?
what?
was that a stupid question?
Mmm! Hmm.
is Tommy Sweet real country? Tommy, oh, yeah.
he tries coverin' it up. I taught him country, you know?
he won't admit it.
he's gotta compete with what's coming out of Nashville today.
but, yeah, he's real country.
how'd you meet him?
I don't wanna talk about Tommy.
all right. What do you wanna talk about?
I wanna talk about how bad you make this room look.
I never noticed what a dump it was until you came in here.
I haven't seen somebody blush in I don't know how long.
well, I can't help it. My capillaries are close to the skin.
where you from anyway?
I'm from Enid, Oklahoma.
of course you are.
what's the most important thing about you, Oklahoma?
I've got a son Buddy.
he's four.
he's at his babysitter. I'd better go get him.
thank you for talking to me.
did you get what you need?
could always use more. Yeah, well
come to tomorrow night's show. We can continue where we left off.
all right.
okay then.
nighty-night.
Hey, Bad. I got great news for you.
now, I'm bustin' my ass on this.
so write it down.
cancel Benson, Arizona, on your itinerary.
you're into Phoenix, Arizona, Sun Pavilion. 8: 00 sharp. How's that?
pavilion?
Hey, I just called to tell you you're out of the Red Bison Lounge...
and you're opening a major show in Phoenix.
opening? Shit, I don't open
bad, cut the shit.
now, where else are you gonna play in front of 12, 000 people?
open for who? You're opening for Tommy.
no, no. No. No goddamn way.
I haven't been able to convince him about doing the record yet.
but at least I got him to agree to this.
no, I'm not gonna do it, Jack.
I'm not gonna open for Tommy. I'll open for somebody else, but not Tommy.
who else are you gonna open for?
you're gonna open for Madonna? You want me to call her?
the dream of every sideman is that someday the front man, whose ass he's been starin' at for years, is gonna open for him.
I don't owe Tommy Sweet that dream. I don't owe him a fuckin' thing.
we both know Tommy owes you big.
but we also both know how much this is worth.
I'm gonna call you back this afternoon. There is no time, Bad.
yes or no?

two bars of"D" and then we hit the top of the bridge.
go on, count it off, Johnny.
one, two. One, two, three, four!
never see it comin' till it's gone
no, no, no. Bear. Bear. Bear.
I need kick and snare. Turn down the damn guitars.
you're drowning out my lyrics. The mix is good, man.
you can't hear what I'm hearing out here.
Yeah, you'd be surprised. Set it the way I tell ya and leave it.
the mix is just fine, man. Trust me on this.
bear, I'm an old man. I get grumpy. Humor me.
damn sound men. They try to fuck up the opening act.
you know? It makes the headliner sound that much better.
that's their fuckin' job.
you got another half hour there, cowboy.
hey there, partner. We're gonna be up on this stage till we get the mix the way I want it.
you set the mix the way I want it, or I'm gonna be up here rehearsing right through Tommy's set.
all right. Let's take it from the top of the bridge.
let's see how Bear does.
one, two, three, four.
now the guitars are sounding right.
never see it comin' till it's gone
thank you, Bear. Much better.
Tommy! Can we get a picture?
Oh.
well, well. Heard you might be here.
you son of a bitch. Sit on down.
you always knew the right thing to say.
how the hell are you, Bad?
I'm worse. That's about right, I reckon.
what, you give up on the Southern Comfort, huh?
I still drink it on stage. It's good for the throat.
Yeah, that's what they tell me. Too damn sweet for me.
hell, I never liked it either. But when you're one of Bad's Boys, you gotta be able to put away the whiskey.
I'm sorry. I-I hate to interrupt.
can I get an autograph, Tommy? Thanks. Sure.
you're my favorite. I-I got all your records.
thank you.
but this is the, uh This is the autograph you need.
that's Bad Blake.
taught me everything I know. Cool.
great. Thanks. I'll be at your show tonight.
I may even make it to San Diego. Appreciate your support.
I was thinkin' about about our tours together.
they were some good times, boy.
Oh.
look, I'm really glad you agreed to do this, Bad.
Oh, God. Are you kiddin'?
I need the money.
wasn't for this,
I'd be playing some saloon in Benson, Arizona.
Yeah.
you remember that time we, uh
we broke down on the desert in West Texas?
sat out all day waiting for that goddamn wrecker.
well. Just you and me and a case of warm beer.
those were the days. Yeah.
ain't remembering wonderful?
how's the tour going? It's a grind.
fifty dates in two months. Oh.
how about yours? I'm out for a month. Six states.
pick up bands? Yeah.
that's a ball buster.
hell, we should've gotten together earlier, done the whole tour.
we tried that.
there was just too much goin' on, Bad.
that damn movie shoot down in Mexico.
Jill was on my ass all the time. Yeah.
would've been a hell of a tour though.
Oh, yeah. Hell of a tour.
Aw, shit. I'm sorry, Bad, it didn't work out.
I was tryin' to keep my marriage together.
don't hold that against me. I got a career too.
and a marriage or two I wanted to hold together.
I know. I know.
you gave me my start, Bad.
don't think I don't remember that.
but I got a life too.
well, well.
those are the ugliest goddamn boots I've ever seen in my life.
was the salesman threatenin' to shoot your dog?
Oh.
Hey. How come we're not doin' another album?
why won't you do it? Hold up now. I never said I wouldn't.
dmz just doesn't think it's the right thing to do. That's all.
Mmm, I think it is. Well, you may be right.
they want a couple more solos first. Then we do a duet.
and you got first shot. I already told them.
you know, I need money now.
I'm 57 years old. Career's goin' nowhere.
I need something to get it jump-started.
they won't give me a damn solo album.
I need this, goddamn it. I really do.
I swear, Bad. I can't get them to budge on this one.
but there is a way you can make some money if you want to.
enlighten me. Songs.
I ain't got no new material.
everything I'm hearing is straight crap.
you write me five new songs, I'll give you back end.
I ship two million albums every time I release one.
I haven't written a new song in three years.
too many goddamn songs.
you write some of the best material out there, Bad. I want some.
wrote. Wrote. Not write.
well, I'm glad to see you still got old Bessie.
Ah, she runs like a top.
do it, Bad. You got a couple months.
see you tonight.
Mr. Greene has sent five boxes of product...
for you to sell here at the show.
sell? What are you talkin' about?
he sent 500 units of Memories for you to sell.
Aw, shit. I sing, I play.
I don't sell my goddamn records at my concerts.
tell him to get his ass out here to Phoenix and pick up his goddamn CDs.
I'm just delivering the message.
Jesus Christ.
ladies and gentlemen, please welcome on stage
the Wrangler of Love, Mr. Bad Blake!
sure is good to be with you tonight.
of course, at my age, it's good to be anywhere.
three, four!
I was goin' where I shouldn't go
seein' who I shouldn't see
doin' what I shouldn't do
and bein' who I shouldn't be
a little voice told me it's all wrong
another voice told me it's all right
I used to think that I was strong
but lately I just lost the fight
it's funny how fallin' feels like flyin'
for a little while
it's funny how fallin' feels like flyin'
for a little while
I got tired of bein' good
I started missin' that old feeling free
I stopped actin' like I thought I should
and went on back to bein' me
I never meant to hurt no one
I just had to have my way
if there's such a thing as too much fun
this must be the price you pay
it's funny how fallin' feels like flyin'
for a little while
it's funny how fallin' feels like flyin'
for a little while
never see it comin' till it's gone
it all happens for a reason
even when it's wrong
especially when it's wrong
it's funny how fallin' feels like flyin'
for a little while
it's funny how fallin' feels like flyin'
for a little while
I was goin' where I shouldn't go
seein' who I shouldn't see
doin' what I shouldn't do
and bein' who I shouldn't be
this is the guy who taught me how to sing that song...
and just about everything else Bad Blake.
I gotta go backstage and listen to the rest of his show.
thank you, Bad.
bad, Tommy would like you to join him in his set...
for "Please Release Me" and "Memories." I'll cue you.
I got records to sell.
bring out the band!
I was born on a flat-top two-lane
picked up a guitar and every day I'd sing
till I was gone
gone, gone, gone
I should've known that this love would never last
I see it clearly through the whiskey in my glass
till you're gone
gone, gone, gone
I've been wastin' too much time
I'm in a big hurry I gotta get on down the line
my trouble travels in a song
because I'm gone
gone, gone, gone
directory assistance. What city and state?
uh, Santa Fe, New Mexico.
bud. Hello?
hey there, Buddy boy. It's your old biscuit maker, Bad.
Hi! What you up to?
um, watching dinosaurs.
yeah? What are they doin'? Uh, eating breakfast.
yeah? Any of them eatin' biscuits?
Yeah.
is your mama there?
Hello? Hey there.
it's Bad.
Jean?
Hi.
how was Phoenix?
Oh, you know.
how you doin'? Where are you?
uh, I don't know. Out in it.
Why? I mean, what what are you doin'?
Oh, thinkin' about you.
now stop it.
are you thinkin' about me?
I'm finishing my article actually.
that's not what I meant.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, I got a couple days off before I gotta be in Houston.
I was thinking about stopping by. What do you think?
Jean?
you're not making this easy on me, girl. You want me to stop by or not?
okay. All right.
well, I'll be by in about three or four hours then.
see you in a little bit.
Bye. Bye now.
Whoa!
Hello, Mr. Blake.
just sit back. Relax. Where am I now?
you're in Santa Fe. You have a broken ankle.
you also have a concussion. Where's my my guitars?
they're in the closet with your clothes.
Oh. Gotta get outta here.
when you can go is up to the doctor. Where's the doctor?
I'll get the doctor for you. Just sit back. Just relax.
we'll get the doctor.
let me be honest with you, okay?
the problem isn't your ankle. It will heal cleanly.
the problem is your general condition, or the extreme lack of it.
now, the kinds of stuff we're talking here emphysema, heart failure, cancer, an extremely good chance of a stroke
are gonna kill you.
are you gonna talk to me?
about what? Look.
let's not kid ourselves about this one. You're an alcoholic.
I'll take care of your leg, give you something for your cholesterol.
but you have to stop smoking, stop drinking...
and lose 25 pounds.
okay, Mr. Blake?
Ah, geez. If I'm half as good about being laid up as I think I'm gonna be
okay, you need to hush now, seriously. Why?
am I ramblin'?
must be those blue pills. Think I can get a prescription or two of those?
No!
your heart's on the loose
you roll them sevens with nothin' to lose
this ain't no place for the weary kind
you know that song?
hmm? Can't remember who did it.
that's the way it is with good ones.
you're sure you've heard 'em before.
you wrote that?
Yes, ma'am, just now.
this is so unfair. What?
some people give 10 years of their life to be able to do something like that, and it just it just pours out of you.
you mad at me?
you want me to go to a motel? No.
what?
I don't want you to go.
well, what then?
well, you're writin' a song on my bed.
so? So...
every time I lie down,
I'm gonna hear that beautiful goddamn song, and
and you're gonna be out there...
runnin' around, not even rememberin' this day...
that I can't even forget.
if I could walk, I'd come to you.
sweetie, come here.
come here. Listen to me.
when I was at the hospital,
I thought about who to call.
who really gives a damn about me?
and then, I thought about who I wanted to see.
you hear me? Huh?
I'm not gonna forget about you.
I'm not gonna forget about this day.
I promise you.
look at you.
what the hell are you doin' back in Santa Fe?
anyway, you're not supposed to be there.
I'm visiting a friend. Well, can you drive yet?
pretty soon. All right. I want you to get back out there...
as soon as possible. Jesus Christ.
if you found out your sister was turnin' five-dollar tricks, you'd over book her.
very, very funny. Remind me to book you into some comedy clubs.
just so you know, I have a contract here...
offering you $75, 000.
an advance for an album to be recorded at a future date.
Why? Wait-Wait a minute.
what offer? Don't worry about who, who, who, who.
Plus, another $20, 000
for first refusal rights for all songs to be written or cowritten by you What-What over the next two years.
holy shit. This is gonna be your best year in the last seven.
and you know who's responsible? Tommy Sweet.
bigger & Blacker
ladies and gentlemen...
live from the world-famous Apollo Theater...in Harlem, New York.
are you ready?
are you ready?
please welcome Mr. Chris Rock!
what's up...
new York?
there's Brooklyn in the house.
well, l'm from Brooklyn.
shit, look at this. White people are up top tonight.
you know, I was just in my hotel, a little while ago, on my way here...
and I got in the elevator, right?
I'm getting in the elevator...
and these two high-school white boys try to get on with me...
and l just dove off.
I said, "Y'all ain't killing me!"
I am scared of young white boys.
if you white and under 21, I am running for the hills.
what the hell is wrong with these white kids shooting up the school?
they don't even wait till 3: 00, either.
killing people in the morning. That ain't right.
the Trench Coat Mafia.
no one will play with us.
we have no friends. We're the Trenchcoat Mafia.
Hey, I saw the yearbook pictures. It was six of them.
I didn't have six friends in high school.
I don't got six friends now.
shit, that's three-on-three with a half court.
what the hell is wrong with these kids?
I got people telling me, "Come on, Chris. Come up to a school. Talk to the kids."
I'm like, "Fuck the kids!
do you got a vest? Maybe I'll think about it.
everybody wants to know what the kids was listening to.
what kind of music was they listening to?
or what kind of movies was they watching?
who gives a fuck what they was watching?
whatever happened to crazy?
what happened to crazy? What, you can't be crazy no more?
did we eliminate "crazy" from the dictionary?
fuck the records. Fuck the movies. Crazy!
when I was a kid, they used to separate the crazy kids from everybody.
when I was a kid, the crazy kids went to school in a little-ass bus.
they had a class at the end of the school...
and they used to get out of school at 2: 30.
just in case they went crazy...
they would only hurt other crazy kids.
and we was all safe.
we was all safe. Damn, the world's coming to an end.
you'll have little white kids saying, "I want to go to a black school where it's safe."
that's right, man.
and everybody's talking about gun control, got to get rid of the guns.
fuck that. I like guns.
you got a gun, you don't have to work out.
I ain't working out. I ain't jogging.
you got pecs, I got Tecs.
fuck that shit. You don't need no gun control.
you know what you need? We need some bullet control.
man, we need to control the bullets, that's right.
I think all bullets should cost $5, 000.
$5, 000 for a bullet. You know why?
cause if a bullet costs $5, 000, there'd be no more innocent bystanders.
that'd be it.
every time someone gets shot, people will be like, "Damn, he must have did something."
shit, they put $50, 000 worth of bullets in his ass.
people would think before they killed somebody, if a bullet cost $5, 000.
man, I would blow your fucking head off, if I could afford it.
I'm gonna get me another job, I'm gonna start saving some money...
and you're a dead man.
you better hope I can't get no bullets on layaway.
so even if you get shot by a stray bullet...
you won't have to go to no doctor to get it taken out.
whoever shot you would take their bullet back.
I believe you got my property.
that's right, man.
see, everybody blames the kids as fucking crazy.
everybody wants to be mad at the kids for shooting up the school.
what about the parents? The parents.
the parents is really fucked up, man.
their damn parents need to go to jail for some of this fucking shit, man.
cause everybody knows that crazy-ass kid that went to jail.
you go, "Man, he ain't never had a chance."
if you'd known his mama, you'd know he gonna be there.
I was at the club the other night, down at Life, chilling at the club.
I'm chilling with this girl. She was dancing.
it was about 2: 00 a. m. I'm talking to her, and realized she had two kids at home.
I don't mind the two kids at home, that's all good.
but I'm like, "What the fuck are you doing in a club..."
at 2: 00 in the fucking morning on a Wednesday night?
what the fuck are you doing here?
is it your birthday?
did you get a raise?
well, you got to get the fuck out.
you go. I'm kicking you the fuck out. Yes, bye!
go take care of them kids before they rob me in 10 years.
you got to get your kid on or your groove on.
you can't get both on at the same time. I'm tired of this shit.
and a bunch of girls are like:
you don't need no man to help you raise no child.
shut the fuck up with the bullshit.
Yeah, you can do it without a man but that don't mean it's to be done.
shit, you could drive a car with your feet if you want to.
that don't make it a good fucking idea.
I don't give a fuck. You could be the baddest mama on earth.
I don't give a fuck how good you are.
ain't nothing you can say more powerful than, "I'm gonna tell your daddy."
can't fuck with it.
can't come close to, "I'm gonna tell your daddy."
you can have a gun at the kid's head, "I'll blow your fucking head off."
so what? - "I'll tell your daddy."
okay, okay.
can't fuck with it, man.
I'm tired of bumping into these girls at the club...
all late on a fucking weeknight.
I got a little cousin who got left back in the first grade.
left back in the first grade...
cause his mama's out getting the groove on.
you know how dumb you got to be...
to get left back in the first grade?
what's four plus four? - "Jell-O."
but that ain't his fault. That's the mama's fault.
that's the mama's fucking fault. That's right.
I'm telling my cousin, "Tina, talk to your fucking kid."
talk to him, teach him some shit.
if you said more words to him than,'Mommy be back'...
he might know something.
that's right.
and it's real easy to tell who kids are gonna be fucked up.
it don't take no scientist to tell who's gonna have some fucked-up kids.
if the kid calls his grandmamma "Mommy..."
and his mama "Pam," he's going to jail.
you ain't saving no college money, you saving bail money.
that money's going to Johnnie Cochran.
that's right. If the kid can't read, that's Mama's fault.
that is Mama's fucking fault.
now, if the kid can't read cause there ain't no lights in the house...
that's Daddy's fault.
you got this shit down?
see, nobody gives a fuck about Daddy. There's some real daddies out there.
I'm not talking about the guy that fucked you and left.
fuck him, okay? I'm talking about the real daddies.
there's still some motherfuckers out there that handle their business.
motherfuckers wanna act like brothers...
there's some brothers that handle their business.
cause people don't give a fuck... Nobody gives a fuck about Daddy.
everybody takes Daddy for granted. Just listen to the radio.
everything's "Mama. Dear Mama. Always loved my Mama.
what's the Daddy song? Papa was a Rollin' Stone.
nobody gives a fuck. Nobody appreciates Daddy.
now, Mama's got the roughest job. I ain't gonna front.
but at least people appreciate Mama.
every time Mama do something right, Mama gets a compliment...
cause women need to hear compliments all the time.
women need food, water, and compliments.
that's right.
and an occasional pair of shoes.
that's right. Women got to hear it all the time, or they lose their minds.
and get Daddy to make sure you thank your mama for everything.
tell your mama how good the food is. Tell her how nice the house looks.
tell your mama how nice her hair looks.
did you tell your mama? You better go in there and tell your mama.
that's right! "Tell your mama."
nobody ever tells Daddy shit.
I'm talking about the real daddies that handle their fucking business.
nobody ever says, "Hey, Daddy, thanks for knocking out this rent."
Hey, Daddy, I sure love this hot water.
Hey, Daddy, this is easy to read with all this light.
nobody gives a fuck about Daddy.
I'm talking about a daddy that handles his business. Nobody gives a fuck about Daddy.
think about everything that the real daddy does:
pay the bills, buy the food, put a fucking roof over your head.
everything you could ever ask for.
make your world a better, safer place.
and what does Daddy get for all his work?
the big piece of chicken. That's all Daddy gets...
is the big piece of chicken.
that's right. And some women don't want to give up the big piece of chicken.
who the fuck is you...
to keep the big piece of chicken?
how dare you keep the big piece of chicken!
a man can't work 12 hours and come home to a wing.
when I was a kid, my mama would lose her mind...
if one of us ate the big piece of chicken by accident.
what the fuck! You ate the big piece of chicken?
Oh, Lord! No, no.
now I got to take some chicken and sew it up and shit.
get me two wings and a pork chop. Daddy'll never know the difference.
just can't do it. Can't do it.
I don't know, man. The world's nuts. It's all good for Clinton.
any time something bad happens, it's good for Bill Clinton.
just gets people off his ass.
stop thinking about me. Good. Kids got shot. Good.
good. People are not thinking about me.
tornadoes. Good.
people ain't thinking about me.
clinton damn near got impeached, for what?
for what?
lied about a blowjob so his wife wouldn't find out.
is that against the law?
do you need the Supreme Court for that one?
you could have took that one to The People's Court!
could have took that one to Judge Judy.
she'd have knocked it out in a half hour, plus commercials.
what the fuck did Clinton do?
they was charging him with shit I didn't even know was crimes.
you got her some gifts. So what he got her gifts? That's his friend.
you can't buy your friend a gift?
"tried to get her a job." You can't get your friend a job?
shit, 80% of the people in this room got their job...
because a friend recommended them.
it's against the law to get your friend a job?
shit, she blew him for a couple of months.
the least he could do is give her a recommendation!
it's the least he could do.
see, people...
everybody expects this holy behavior cause he's the President.
expect him to behave this holy way.
he's just the President. He ain't Rev. Clinton.
it ain't Pastor Clinton. It ain't Maharajah Clinton.
it is just Bill Clinton. He's just a man. A man's gonna be a man.
a man is basically as faithful as his options.
that's how faithful a man is, no more, no less.
you see all these fat Republican guys going, "I would never do such a thing. This is a travesty."
I'm like, "Nobody's trying to blow you."
ain't no 20-year-old girls trying to blow Orrin Hatch.
ain't nobody trying to give Newt Gingrich some.
I don't give a fuck, you ain't never gonna hear Newt Gingrich go, "Man, I wish these hoes would back up off me."
I wish they would just back the fuck up off me.
let a player play, shit!
that's right.
it's damn near impossible for a man to turn down sex.
it's hard for a man to turn down sex.
we can stop chasing it, and even that requires some rehab.
but it's hard for a man to stop.
if it chase us, we can't run that fast.
it's gonna catch us, we're like, "Shit, pulled a hamstring. You got me."
you can't run that fast.
see, it's easy for women to turn down sex. It ain't shit for y'all to turn down sex.
it ain't no thing for y'all to turn down sex.
y'all like, "Why can't you turn it down? I do it all the time."
why can't you say no? I say no." See, it's easy for y'all. You know why?
cause every woman in here, ever since you were 13...
every guy you met has been trying to fuck you.
that's right. Women are offered dick every day.
every woman in here...
gets offered dick at least three times a week.
three times a day, shit!
that's right, every time a man's being nice to you...
all he's doing is offering dick. That's all it is.
can I get that for you? How about some dick?
could I help you with that? Could I help you to some dick?
do you need some dick?
nobody offers us shit.
we got to fend for ourselves.
we can't believe it when we get an offer. We're like, "Damn, this is my lucky day."
that's right, man.
see, this whole Monica Lewinsky scandal, a lot of this shit is Hillary's fault.
that's right, I said it.
I said it. It had to be said. Somebody got to say it.
everybody's like, "Hillary's a hero." No, she ain't.
Aquaman's a hero.
he can talk to the fishes. What the fuck can Hillary do?
a lot of this shit is Hillary's fault, cause, ladies, you know your man.
you know your man better than he knows himself.
you know what kind of man you got.
you know if you got the crazy, need-a-blowjob-all-the-time man.
so sometimes you gotta save your man from himself.
so you know what happens if he don't get his medicine.
so Hillary Clinton put us all in danger.
she put the security of the free world in jeopardy...
and she needs to suffer the consequences for her actions.
that's right, she's the First Lady.
she's supposed to be the first one on her knees to suck his dick!
shit!
that's right. Monica Lewinsky shouldn't have even stood a chance.
Hillary's supposed to already be down there like, "Hey, I got it."
I've got it. I got the dick.
tickle his ass, or something.
Yeah, grab a ball, make yourself useful.
and they always been on Clinton.
before any of this happened, they was on Clinton.
what was they on him for?
gays in the military. Everybody says, "Don't let them in."
if they wanna fight, let them fight, cause I ain't fighting.
I wouldn't give a fuck if I saw a Russian tank rolling down Flatbush Avenue.
I ain't shooting nobody. So call me a faggot.
when the war is over, I'll be the faggot with two legs, thank you.
you know what's fucked up? Everybody gets so homophobic.
people, we need to cut that shit out...
cause everybody in this room got at least a gay cousin.
every last one of you got a gay cousin.
you knew he was gay when y'all was kids.
you was playing ball, he was jumping rope.
he didn't turn gay, he was gay then. He just didn't have nobody to be gay with.
shit, I got a gay uncle. Call him Aunt Tom.
every Christmas, he comes over with his "friend."
see, it don't make no sense to hate nobody.
it don't make no sense to be a racist, sexist, or nothing, but... It don't.
it doesn't.
it don't make no sense...
cause whoever you hate will end up in your family.
that's right, you don't like gays, you're gonna have a gay son.
you don't like Puerto Ricans?
your daughter's gonna come home with "Livin' la vida loca"!
don't you just love that shit?
that's a catchy-ass song.
you just want to jump up on shit. "Livin' la vida loca"!
come on!
I feel that shit. I'll be driving, "Livin' la vida loca"!
I love that shit.
that ain't going nowhere. That's gonna be out a long time.
that shit is like the Puerto Rican Whoomp! !
I was talking about my gay uncle.
see, your uncles prepare you for life.
if you got enough uncles, they'll prepare you for life...
cause you got every type of uncle.
you got your gay uncle, you got your alcoholic uncle.
you got your stealing uncle.
you got your molester uncle.
everybody's got that one molester uncle.
your mama's like, "Where them kids at"?
they're with Johnny. - "Get them kids"!
hurry up, get them kids! Don't leave them with your Uncle Johnny!
later on, you get molested, your mama get mad at you.
that's what you get.
hanging around fucking Johnny. I told you about that shit!
now walk it off!
that's your family.
I don't know. Let's talk about Clinton.
one thing Clinton did I didn't like, raise taxes. Taxes all high and shit.
you know what's fucked-up about taxes?
you don't even pay taxes. They take tax.
you get your check, money gone.
that ain't a payment, that's a jack.
got all these taxes: city tax, state tax, Social Security tax.
you don't get the money until you're 65.
meanwhile, the average black man dies at 54.
shit, we should get Social Security at 29!
what the fuck, man? We don't live that long.
hypertension, high blood pressure, NYPD, something will get you.
what the fuck is up with the police? My God!
I am scared. I didn't get rid of no guns. Fuck that shit.
and I had a cop pull me over the other day, scared me so bad...
made me think I stole my own car.
get out the car, get out the fucking car! You stole this car!
I'm like, "Damn, maybe I did."
Oh, Lord, I done stole a car.
you know what's worse than taxes? What's worse than tax is insurance.
you got to have some insurance.
they shouldn't even call it insurance. They just should call it "in case shit."
I give a company some money in case shit happens.
now, if shit don't happen, shouldn't I get my money back?
that's right, man, you better have some medical insurance, or you gonna die.
that's right, everybody. You got to eat right and exercise.
no, you don't, you need some coverage.
coverage will save your life.
that's right, we all gonna die, but at least if you got some coverage...
you will die on a mattress.
that's right. When I was a kid, we didn't have no insurance.
we didn't have a damn thing.
you had to be damn near dead to see the doctor.
you had to be way past Robitussin.
that's all we had when I was a kid: Robitussin.
no matter what you got, Robitussin better handle it.
daddy, I got asthma. - "Robitussin."
I got cancer. - "Robitussin."
I broke my leg, Daddy poured Robitussin on it.
Yeah, boy, let that 'tussin get in there.
Yeah, boy, let that 'tussin get on down to the bone.
the 'tussin ought to straighten out the bone. It's good.
if you run out of 'tussin, put some water in the jar, shake it up, more 'tussin.
more 'tussin!
y'all like doctors 'cause they don't cure shit.
they don't cure nothing.
same diseases been hanging out since I was a kid, man.
what's the last shit a doctor cured? Polio.
you know how long ago polio was?
that's like the first season of Lucy.
shit, Fred had an Afro with finger waves!
have you ever met anybody with polio?
anybody feel a little 'poly around you?
no. That's right, they don't cure shit.
the same diseases been hanging out since I was a kid:
ALDS, sickle cell, tuberculosis, cancer, Jerry's kids still limping around.
I've been watching the Jerry Lewis Telethon...
for probably about 15 or 16 years now.
not one stitch of progress whatsoever.
come on, man. Lie to me, Jerry!
what the fuck you doing, Jerry?
put a stick in the kid's back, prop him up or some shit!
come on, call Steven Spielberg.
get some special effects on this shit!
get George Lucas on the case!
cgi, motherfucker!
what the fuck!
tie some string around him, make a cripple puppet or some shit.
lie to me!
where the fuck's the money going?
what, to keep Jerry's hair black?
Where's the money going? Think about it.
Frank Sinatra: dead. Dean Martin: dead. Sammy Davis: dead.
Jerry Lewis got a full head of black hair.
and if you ain't gonna cure the disease, cut the kids a check!
that's right, you know the little boy who's getting ready to die? Get him a table dance.
get him a table dance, for Christ's sake!
I'm sure the Make-A-Wish people hear that request every now and then.
get the boy a table dance.
what do you want, Jimmy? You're dying. Wanna meet Jim Carrey?
no, I want some big titties in my face.
it's my last wish, come on.
that's right, man.
that's right, we got AlDS out there. You think they're gonna cure AIDS?
no, they can't even cure athlete's foot.
they ain't curing AIDS. Shit, they ain't never curing AIDS.
don't even think about that shit.
they ain't curing it, cause there ain't no money in the cure.
the money's in the medicine. That's how you get paid, on the comeback.
that's how a drug dealer makes his money, on the comeback.
that's all the government is:
a bunch of motherfucking drug dealers, on the comeback.
they ain't curing no AlDS.
that's all it is.
you think they're gonna cure AIDS?
they're still mad at all the money they lost on polio!
curing AIDS? Shit, that's like Cadillac making a car that lasts for 50 years.
and you know they can do it...
but they ain't gonna do nothing that fucking dumb.
shit, they got metal on the space shuttle that can go around the moon...
and withstand temperatures of up to 20, 000 degrees.
you mean to tell me you don't think they can make an Eldorado...
where the fucking bumper don't fall off?
they can, but they won't.
so what they will do with AIDS is the same thing they do with everything else.
they will figure out a way for you to live with it.
they don't cure shit, they just patch it up.
get you to the next stop, so they can get more of your money.
they ain't gonna cure it.
hopefully, in our lifetime, you're gonna see somebody go:
yo, man, you weren't at work yesterday. What's up?
my AIDS is acting up.
you know, when the weather get like this, my AIDS just pop up.
but I took some Robitussin. I'm fine now!
that's right, man. AIDS is scary, man.
I took my AIDS test, passed it, got 65.
you know what's scary about the AIDS test?
what's scary is you don't get the results back for five days.
five days, that's a long time.
and you know what happens in those five days? You start reflecting.
you start thinking about every nasty, skank-ass...
questionable piece of sex you ever had...
and everybody got a few.
and you're like, "God, what the fuck was I thinking"?
1993. She didn't even have teeth!
Oh, God!
what the fuck was on my mind?
it's like the movie Scrooge, and the Ghost of Pussy Past comes.
remember me? I'm Itchy, the stripper from Miami.
you know what else happens after you take an AIDS test?
you start calling up people to see if they're alive.
Hello, can I speak to Lisa? - This is Lisa.
Hello, can I speak to Tammy? - Tammy dead.
what happened?
she got hit by a bus.
thank the Lord! Yes!
go Greyhound!
Yeah, she got hit by a bus!
livin' la vida loca!
at least they're still working on AIDS. At least they're trying to get rid of AIDS.
some diseases, they just gave up on.
there's some diseases, if you get them, you on your own.
they ain't gonna have no telethon for you...
R. Kelly ain't singing no song.
you just got this shit, that's right.
you get paralyzed, they don't got shit for you.
look at Christopher Reeve, paralyzed.
Superman can't walk. What kind of sorry-ass shit is that?
Superman can't walk. What's next? What the fuck!
Aquaman gonna drown in the tub?
what the fuck kind of injustice is this?
Superman can't walk.
the Hulk gonna get the gout? What the fuck!
Superman can't walk.
now you go tell a doctor you paralyzed, they don't got shit for you.
doc, I'm paralyzed. What you got?
why don't you take this chair and roll your ass around town?
is that all the fuck you got is a goddamn chair?
where do I take this prescription, to a furniture store, motherfucker?
I gotta go to IKEA? What the fuck is this shit?
I said I can't walk. I didn't say I can't sit!
that's right. And if you go blind, they don't got shit for you.
look at Stevie Wonder, been blind for 40-something years...
got all the money in the world. Don't know if he got hundreds or ones!
it's just a stack to Stevie.
they don't got... Stevie can't see shit.
can't see the day, the night, the shadow, the shade, can't even get a peek!
just a peek. Can we help Stevie get a peek? Get a fucking peek!
the man wrote Songs in the Key of Life, Talking Book, Innervisions.
can we get this brother a peek? Just a fucking peek!
is that asking for too much? Just a... That's it.
you tell the doctor you're blind, he don't got shit for you.
doc, I'm blind. What you got?
why don't you take this dog and have the dog drag your blind ass around town?
that's all the fuck you got, is a damn dog? Man, if I could see, I would whup your ass!
a fucking dog! What the fuck is wrong with you?
come on, give me a midget or something!
that's right, blind people should get midgets.
all blind people should get midgets.
it's hard enough living life when you're blind.
now they gotta learn how to talk dog.
what kind of shit is that? You can't see, so you can't read the dog's lips.
you just listen.
what, my shoelace untied? What?
is it cold outside? What?
is somebody at the door? What, motherfucker?
just give blind people midgets.
and if you're a midget, it's already hard enough to get a job.
just have the midget tell the blind man where to go. Be a seeing-eye man.
just walk in front of the blind man like, "Yo, man, you gotta make a left."
just make a left, brother.
racism everywhere, everybody pissed off. Black people yelling, "Racism."
white people yelling, "Reverse racism."
chinese people yelling, "Sideways racism"!
and the Indians ain't yelling shit 'cause they dead.
so everybody bitch about how bad their people got it.
nobody got it worse than the American Indian.
everybody need to calm the fuck down.
indians got it bad. Indians got it the worst.
you know how bad the Indians got it? When's the last time you met two Indians?
you ain't never met two Indians.
shit, I have seen a polar bear ride a fucking tricycle in my lifetime.
I have never seen an Indian family that's chilling out at Red Lobster.
never seen it.
everybody wanna save the environment. Shit, I see trees every fucking day!
I don't never see no Indians.
I went to the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade this year.
they didn't have enough Indians for that shit.
they had a bunch of Pilgrims.
when it came time for the Indians, they had three real Indians...
and the rest was a bunch of Puerto Ricans with feathers in their hair.
what the fuck! Shit, I know Puerto Ricans when I see them.
you can't slip a Puerto Rican by me.
that's not Pocahontas, that's Jennifer Lopez!
racism everywhere. Who's the maddest people? White people.
not y'all. Y'all all right.
you paid money to see me, we cool.
the feud is over.
no, you watch the TV, watch 60 Minutes. You see white people pissed off, man.
man, the white man thinks he's losing the country.
you watch the news: "We're losing everything. We're fucking losing.
affirmative action, and illegal aliens...
and we're fucking losing the country.
losing? Shut the fuck up. White people ain't losing shit.
if y'all losing, who's winning?
it ain't us.
it ain't us. Have you driven around this motherfucker?
it ain't us.
shit, there ain't a white man in this room that would change places with me.
none of you would change places with me. And I'm rich!
that's how good it is to be white.
there's a white, one-legged busboy in here right now...
that won't change places with my black ass.
he's going, "No, man, I don't wanna switch. I wanna ride this white thing out."
see where it takes me.
that's right, 'cause when you white, the sky's the limit.
when you black, the limit's the sky!
that's right, man. Now, when it comes to racism...
do you know who the most racist people are for real, the real most racist people?
old black men.
you find a brother over 60... I know you white people know an old black man.
you go, "Willie at the job, he's so nice." Willie hates your guts.
there's nothing more racist than an old black man. You know why?
cause an old black man went through some real racism.
he didn't go through that I-can't-get-a-cab shit.
he was the cab.
a white man just jump on his back, "Main Street."
left, nigger!
left, you fucking nigger!
you know what's wild about the old black men?
an old black man, he ain't gonna let you fuck up his money.
whenever an old black man sees an old white man...
the old black man always kisses the old white man's ass.
how you doing, sir? Pleased to meet you. Whatever I can get you, you let me know.
as soon as the white man get out of sight, he's like:
cracker-ass cracker!
I'll put my foot in the crack of your ass, cracker-ass cracker!
I wish that cracker would've said some shit to me, saltine-assed, motherfucking cracker!
cracker, kiss my ass, you fucking cracker!
the white man come back. "Howdy, sir?
I got an uncle real crazy.
my uncle B. 55 years old, hates the white people, married to a white lady.
and he sits around going, "These crackers ain't shit, except for Susie."
he tried to explain the whole thing to me one day.
he said, "Yeah, I got a white wife. I love her, she love me. That's all that matters."
but I'll tell you this: if the revolution ever come, I'll kill her first...
just to show these crackers I mean business!
motherfucker, cracker-ass, motherfucker cracker! Shit, cracker, motherfucker!
hey... Hi, honey.
motherfucker cracker. I'll kill my cracker kids, too!
that's right, man. I don't know, black...
what do we need, y'all? I think we need a new leader.
we ain't had a black leader in a while. In a long time.
somebody that moves you.
you know, we had Martin Luther King, Malcolm X...
and ever since then, a bunch of substitute teachers.
we ain't had the real thing. I want a motherfucker to move me.
who we got? Let me break everybody down. We got Al Sharpton, all right.
al Sharpton's all right. He ain't Malcolm or Martin...
but if you get your ass whupped by the cops, he's the guy to call.
of course, Al kind of looks like Bookman from Good Times...
but don't let that fuck you up.
who else we got? Jesse Jackson. Jesse's all right.
Jesse went over there, Jesse got them hostages.
I don't know how the hell he did that shit.
he went over there with no money, no sweet potato pie.
what the fuck did Jesse say? Jesse must've been, like:
do you want the United States to really be mad at you?
give the hostages to me.
that's what he said, you know. What else we got? Farrakhan?
Farrakhan got everybody together for the Million Man March and everything.
but Farrakhan don't like the Jews, which is bugged.
I get my hair cut on Dekalb Avenue. I never been in a barbershop...
and heard a bunch of brothers talking about Jews.
black people don't hate Jews. Black people hate white people!
we don't got time to dice white people up into little groups.
I hate everybody! I don't care if you just got here.
Hey, I'm Romanian. - You Romanian cracker!
we need a fucking leader, man.
when we got no leaders, when something happens...
we make the shit bigger than it is.
it's big, but don't make it bigger than it is.
I'm watching the news, and like, "Tupac Shakur was assassinated.
biggie Smalls, assassinated. Struck down by assassin's bullets.
I'm like, "No, they wasn't!"
martin Luther King was assassinated.
Malcolm X was assassinated.
John F. Kennedy was assassinated.
them two niggers got shot.
shit, I love Tupac, I love Biggie, but school will be open on their birthday.
I don't think you'll see their pictures hanging up...
in your grandmamma's living room.
that's Abraham, Martin, and Pac.
and right here, I got one of Jesus and Biggie on the seesaw.
Jesus always in the air.
we need a leader. You know who I think the black leader should be?
who I think the black leader should be? - Who?
pat Riley.
coach Pat Riley.
no man has led more black men to the promised land...
than Coach Pat Riley.
he may not get us to the mountaintop, but he'll get us to the playoffs.
and that's all we want.
we got a lot of women here tonight. Love the women.
you know who my favorite women are? Big, fat, black women.
give me a sister about 350 pounds.
the best people in the whole world. You know why?
cause we live in a society where nobody likes who the fuck they are.
everybody's on Prozac, or some shit.
everybody's getting cosmetic surgery.
nobody likes who the fuck they are except fat, black women.
fat, black women don't give a fuck what you think.
she's going out on Friday night.
she got an outfit on. That shit match.
she got the pumps on, and the pump fat coming out the pump.
that's right. It looks like they baking bread in her shoe.
baby, your foot ready yet? I'll just sprinkle some cinnamon on it.
that's right. She got an anklet on, and that anklet's holding on for dear life.
black women don't give a fuck. She's like, "I'm sexy.
I am sexy, yes, I am!
I am the sexiest motherfucker here tonight!
Yeah, I got a gut. There's some good pussy under this gut!
that's right. You want some of this so you can "livin' la vida loca!
love the women, man. Women, women.
what the fuck do y'all want?
do you know what you want? Do you know where you're going to?
do you like the things that life is showing you?
do you know? What the fuck do women want?
I know what you want: everything.
that's every woman's answer: "Everything." Women want every fucking thing.
women act like life was just a big sale, or shit.
I want to get the most shit before things close down.
that's what fucking life is to a woman: everything.
you know what men want?
food, sex, silence. That's it.
food, sex, silence.
feed me, fuck me, shut the fuck up!
our goals seem very attainable, don't they?
women, it's hard to figure women out.
it's hard being a guy. We always think we can buy sex.
if I take her here, she'll give me some. If I buy her this, she'll give me some.
nothing get you nothing.
a woman knows if she's gonna fuck you within the first five minutes of meeting you.
women know right away.
they're shaking hands like, "I'm gonna fuck him."
I hope he don't say nothing too stupid.
that's right, fellas, don't say nothing too stupid...
because women are all about the mood.
if she's in the mood to fuck you, shut up and let it happen.
cause if you say the wrong thing, them panties are coming up mighty fast.
What'd you say?
she be on the phone with a girlfriend, "Yeah, I was gonna give him some..."
but he just started talking.
I hate a yakking man, child.
that's right, man. Relationships: easy to get into, hard to maintain.
why are they so hard to maintain? Because it's hard to keep up the lie.
cause you can't get nobody being you. You got to lie to get somebody.
you can't get nobody looking like you look, acting like you act...
sounding like you sound.
when you meet somebody for the first time, you're not meeting them.
you're meeting their representative.
that's right. Who are the biggest liars, men or women?
men! - Women!
men lie the most, women tell the biggest lies.
men, we lie all the time. We lie so much, it's damn near a language.
it's like, to call a man out for lying...
is like playing basketball with a retarded kid and calling him for double dribble.
you gotta let some shit slide.
men, we lie all the time.
you know what a man's lie is like? A man's lie is like, "I was at Tony's house."
"I'm at Kenny's house." That's a man's lie.
a women's lie is like, "It's your baby."
we've all heard that one.
it don't even look like me. - He's got your hat.
that's right. Who the biggest liars? Women the biggest liars.
look at you, all of you.
you're a fucking liar. You!
you're a liar!
you're all liars. All of you are fucking liars!
masters of the lie, the visual lie.
look at you. You got on heels, you ain't that tall.
you got on makeup, your face don't look like that.
you got a weave, your hair ain't that long.
you got a Wonderbra on, your titties ain't that big.
everything about you is a lie, and you expect me to tell the truth?
fuck you!
men lie, we live lies. That's why we so crazy.
every now and then, we catch ourselves living a lie.
we create a whole lie-world around us.
for instance, every man in this room is hiding some porno in his house.
every man in here got a pornography stash in the crib.
that's right.
not an illegal amount, just enough to get you by.
thank you.
and when we hide porno, we go all out.
it ain't behind the refrigerator or under the bed.
no, we become Batman when it's time to hide some porno.
that's right, you hit the light switch, the whole bookshelf shifts to the side.
you go down two flights of stairs into your porno cellar.
Janet Jacme, Kobe Tai, Jenna Jameson, that's right.
but women always find the porno.
but they don't find it in the porno hiding place. Oh, no.
where do women find the porno at? In the VCR.
and fellas are like, "Damn, how can I be so dumb to leave it in the VCR?"
I'll tell you why.
cause when you're jerking off, you ain't in your right state of mind.
your brain's all cloudy and foggy. I'll tell you exactly what happened.
one day, your woman left early.
you had the whole house to yourself.
so you said, "Let me get a little jerk before work."
so you in the house, getting your jerk on. Nice good jerk, too.
you know, that ain't-nobody-in-the-house jerk.
that's a good jerk. It ain't like that somebody-in-the-next-room jerk.
that's a bad jerk. That's like, "Who's that?"
I don't like that jerk.
I'm talking about the good jerk, that nobody-ain't-home jerk.
so you get the Vaseline ready...
and you just look at your dick and go:
scream if you want to. No one's gonna hear.
and right then, your relationship's in trouble. That's right.
cause if you can't share what you're like, you'll have problems.
when you love somebody, you got to love everything about them.
you got to love the crust of a motherfucker.
you can't just love the white part of the bread.
you gotta love the crust, the crumbs, the tiny crumbs at the bottom of the toaster.
that's what the real motherfucker is.
whatever you into, your woman gotta be into, too, and vice versa...
or the shit ain't gonna work.
it ain't gonna work.
that's right. If you born-again, your woman gotta be born-again, too.
if you a crackhead, your woman gotta be a crackhead, too...
or the shit won't work.
you can't be like, "I'm going to church, where you going?" "Hit the pipe!"
that relationship ain't going nowhere.
two crackheads can stay together forever.
that's right, what's gonna happen? They're gonna stop fucking, that's right.
they'll stop talking, stop fucking.
you ever been in bed with your woman, both talking dirty, and you go too far?
you ever say some shit that gets you kicked out of bed?
and the woman's like, "Fuck me, harder! Fuck me, Daddy, spank me!
all right, you ho. - Who you calling a ho?
who the fuck are you calling a ho?
untie me!
I ain't no expert or no shit, but, fellas, if you're gonna talk dirty to your woman...
you got to talk with authority.
you can get a woman to do any nasty little thing you want.
you say that shit like a man, make a little eye contact...
put a little bass in your voice, she will do that shit.
she wants to do that shit. She's dying to do that shit.
your woman is nastier than you ever imagined.
but you gotta come correct...
because anything you mumble ain't getting done.
you can't be in bed all unsure, like, "Excuse me..."
excuse me, I was wondering...
ma'am, I have a request. Could you lick my balls?
I ain't licking nothing. Lick your own balls!
see, if you just said it right, you'd been in there.
now you got dry balls.
that's right, confidence always wins.
do you realize, it is 1999, some women still don't give head?
Ninety-fucking-nine.
whenever I meet a girl that doesn't give head...
I look at them like a damn Betamax, "They still make you?"
and when it comes to head, there's three types of women:
a: Women that don't give head. Bye, leave, see you.
B: Women that give you just enough head to shut you up.
you ever meet them women? They're like, "You okay?"
I hate them women!
and number three, my favorite woman:
the woman that likes nothing better than to suck a dick.
that's right, God bless all of you!
that's right, you make the world a better place to live in.
I want you to suck my dick like you think the antidote's in it!
like you trying to get some Robitussin out of that motherfucker!
that's right. Relationships: easy to get into, hard to maintain.
why are they so hard to maintain? 'Cause at some point you just stop talking.
that's right, everybody stops talking after a while.
you know how it is. You come home and you start nodding.
Yeah, we cool.
I'm gonna get a little something to eat.
why do you stop talking?
cause at some point, you have heard everything this person has to say...
and it makes you sick to your stomach.
you know what they're gonna say before it even comes out their mouth...
and you just wanna stab them in the neck with a pencil!
your can't take the shit no more!
and they're like, - Remember that time? - Yeah, I remember that time!
I ever tell you about... - Yeah, you told me about that time!
stop telling me the same shit over and over again!
why don't you go out and get kidnapped, have some new shit happen to you?
that's right. Fellas, you gotta talk.
that's women's biggest complaint: "You don't talk."
you need to talk, let's talk. You don't talk.
that's right. Women love to talk.
if they had talking in the Olympics, a man wouldn't stand a chance.
women love to talk, but they don't wanna talk to you.
they wanna talk to their man.
but women don't want you to talk-talk.
women just want you to listen-listen.
all a woman really wants you to do is ask her the correct questions...
that will allow her to run her fucking mouth!
you set her up, she'll knock them down.
fellas, you want your woman to be happy?
all you got to say is, "How was your day"?
honey, how was your day?
know why? 'Cause "How was your day?" is a 45-minute conversation to a woman.
and as a man, you don't really gotta talk. You gotta just act like you're talking.
get out of here. Go on! I don't believe it.
you don't say! Really? Get out of here!
go on. I don't believe it. You don't say? Get out of here.
I told you that bitch crazy!
you gotta throw in, "I told you that bitch crazy." You know why?
cause every woman's got another woman at her job that she can't stand.
women, y'all exaggerate everything. You turn it into some Dynasty shit, like:
she's trying to destroy me!
what the fuck are you talking about? You wrap up bags at J. C. Penney's!
what's she doing, ripping up your paper?
fellas, you gotta talk. Women, exact opposite.
y'all gotta learn when not to talk. That's right.
you ever notice how no man comes home straight from work?
no man comes home straight from work.
a man get off work, he got to go somewhere.
he got to drink something, he got to smoke something...
he got to watch the game, he got to hang with his boys...
he got to take a drive.
he got to do something that will mentally prepare him...
for all the talking he gonna hear when he get home.
ladies, it ain't that you talk too much.
you just talk too much as soon as we get in the fucking door.
let a man get situated. We don't need to hear everything right away.
soon as you take one step in, "You're not gonna believe this..."
let me get my other foot in the fucking door!
let me get something to eat! Let me get something to drink!
let me take a shit!
go in the fucking kitchen and get me my big piece of chicken!
I'm out of here. Thank you, New York!
when do I leave?
the end of the week.
they can't just take you away.
it's done.
you want me to raise your son so he can have your life?
he needs a mother.
I can't do this.
go to your father.
that corner right there, that's where he died, and that's where I'm gonna kill you.
there's something you don't know about those photos.
God, so they took pictures of them being shot?
look at the fingernails.
Oh, my god.
just because I held a gun to him doesn't mean I shot him.
I staged his death.
he's alive?!
no, no, no. No, Emily.
stay with me. Come on, stay with me.
Where's the medic?!
she never made it off the table.
I didn't get a chance to say good-bye.
Yeah, sometimes I feel like I want to quit my job.
and spend my time chasing down the son of a bitch who killed Emily.
you're damn right I'm angry.
the bureau is facing a lot of changes.
over the next few weeks each of you is going to be asked.
if you'd like to stay with the unit.
why wouldn't we? - There are other options for you out there.
you've given some thought to what we discussed?
I'm coming back.
and how long have you been back with the bureau?
3 1/2 months, sir.
a lot has happened since then.
sabbaticals, transfers, reassignments.
four of you remained in the unit?
agents Rossi, Morgan, and I were there with our technical analyst Penelope Garcia.
hmm. You had 14 cases in that time.
17, sir.
Oh, yes. In 14 weeks.
that's impressive.
thank you.
but what's more impressive is the fact that you were reinstated, promoted, and suspended in that short time.
I believe that's a record, Agent Jareau.
why aren't we in there?
they're just trying to intimidate us.
well, that's not about to happen.
I'm not ok with this.
you may not even be a witness.
sir, I'm not worried about me.
don't they have anything better to do than
baby girl, this is just what they do.
anything?
it doesn't look good.
how long is she gonna be in there?
two days? - That's correct.
how can an investigation be active for just two days when the gathering of intel took months?
there's surveillance and hundreds of man-hours to prove it.
Yes, that's true, but
how often do you spend months on a case, Agent?
we don't, but this one was
personal?
different.
it required a lot of detail.
if this was too big for your team, why wasn't it a joint taskforce?
we didn't have time, sir.
once the subject was confirmed, we had to act quickly.
I've got the shot, Agent.
don't take the shot! Don't shoot!
I got him!
want to kill me yourself, Agent?
do you realize what you've done?
Yes. We put an international criminal with terrorist connections in federal custody.
you may consider that a victory, but you used government funds for a personal vendetta, never called Homeland Security, and now 6 people, including two of your agents, are dead.
queen Elizabeth I said, "The past cannot be cured."
Interpol, Europol, the CIA.
no one could locate Ian Doyle, except Agent Morgan.
well, it wasn't easy.
Doyle disappeared underground.
it looks like Agent Morgan spent the first few months
following Doyle's arms-dealing contacts but came up empty.
so, how did he find him?
after hitting dead ends in that world,
agent Morgan put himself in Doyle's shoes and knew that he would be looking for his son, Declan.
OK, Emily needed to get Declan a new identity.
so she must have used someone she trusted.
all right, well, that's a short list, but it's probably not even written down.
even if it was, she's had contacts all over the world.
Oh, tell me about it. Two columns
domestic and imports.
you guys seen Spence?
he's at the firing range. - Again?
ever since Prentiss died, he...
right.
did you guys just get a new case?
it's just an old one.
do you want some fresh eyes?
not just yet.
OK.
um, well, let me know.
shouldn't we tell her?
Garcia, this has been a long shot for 6 months.
why get her hopes up?
what about Hotch?
he knows I'm doing this.
he does?
not technically, but he knows I'm not about to let Doyle roam free.
does he know we're looking for Declan?
I just figured I'd call him when I have something to report.
OK.
but it feels weird not sharing.
baby girl.
you don't have to do this.
I know.
did you trust agent Jareau?
I did.
but don't anymore.
I didn't say that.
you left her out but involved Penelope Garcia, whom you trust.
that is not why.
isn't it?
her specific skills were very helpful.
for your vendetta.
for justice.
you don't believe in the system.
Ian doyle wasn't at the top of anyone's list, Senator.
except yours.
I'm thinking domestic contacts.
em was already in the states when she faked Declan's death, so...
her associates must be in Boston?
no, Garcia, she would have covered her tracks better than that.
all right, why did Prentiss join the BAU?
to have a normal life.
she could have gone anywhere with her skill set, but she chose D. C.
maybe to be close to her mom?
no. No way. That was just by default.
Garcia, she did all of this to protect a child.
right. So you're saying she came here just so she could be close to the kid.
and if she did, she probably had people she could trust living right here.
right. So domestic contacts.
there are surprising few in our nation's capital.
one of which is dead. Ben Corelli.
he was a forger.
Doyle killed him and Prentiss' friend.
he worked out of his apartment, remember?
Yeah. And we processed his belongings.
Thanks.
this would have been a heck of a lot easier had he gone digital.
Garcia, there's an art to all of this.
this guy was meticulous.
definite control freak.
yet he's dead. He couldn't control that.
there can't be a lot of IDs for children.
actually, you would be surprised.
OK, wait a minute.
didn't Prentiss live in Reston, Virginia, for a while?
Yeah. Before we knew her, she rented a big house in a cul-de-sac.
OK, why would she live way out there?
to be close to Declan.
who had blond hair and blue eyes.
well, I'm sure they've changed his hair color by now.
Yeah, but you can't change those cerulean blues.
OK, here's the nanny.
Garcia, she still lives in Virginia.
here's all I got. Declan's going to a boarding school in Stafford County. His nanny lives 5 minutes from campus.
all signs point to a really well-adjusted kid.
he's an honor student. He's playing lacrosse.
he's winning science fairs. It looks like he's got the life
you watched Declan for two months.
I knew if I could find him,
it was only a matter of time before Doyle did.
around-the-clock surveillance requires constant presence.
when I wasn't in the field, I was there.
and when you were on a case?
I set up pole cameras for surveillance.
under what authority, Agent?
senator, I needed to protect this child because I knew Doyle would find him eventually.
and what was the plan once you found Ian Doyle?
lock down security on his son and then move in on Doyle.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
it's him. I'm pretty sure it's him.
it's blurry and, you know, he's not like posing for the camera or anything like that, but you said he'd come and it's been a while and now he's here and
Garcia, Garcia, calm down. Let me take a look.
that's when Agent Morgan initiated the assault on Ian Doyle.
what? No, it doesn't work that way, sir.
agent Morgan called Hotch.
excuse me, our unit chief.
who was on temporary duty.
I imagine he wasn't easy to find.
when the team downsized, he was assigned to lead an investigative taskforce.
Hotchner.
Hey, it's me.
how's it going out there?
you know, long days, some territorial issues to work out.
nothing surprising. How's everything there?
Hotch, we found Declan Doyle.
what?
listen, I knew that finding the kid
was the only way I could find Doyle, Hotch.
I know what you're thinking, man.
is Declan safe?
Yeah, he is for now.
I've had surveillance at his house and his school for a few weeks.
Morgan, I didn't authorize this.
I know you didn't, Hotch, but listen to me.
I think Doyle may have found Declan, too.
all right, I'm coming back.
you want me to wait?
Morgan, it could be a trap.
you make sure you have eyes on Doyle.
and if it is him?
then you take the shot.
you got any movement?
negative. No movement detected.
that's all Hotch said?
take the shot?
Yeah, but he's pissed.
Hey, Spence.
I can't find him.
what do you mean, you can't find him?
the headmistress said Declan got sick and went home.
OK, uh, call for backup and get to the house.
we're already here.
you see the agents?
their car's out front.
the lights are off.
I'll call you back.
What--Reid!
I'll check the back. You take the hallway.
must be the nanny.
3 bodies and no kid.
Doyle's got him.
the squad car that went by got Doyle's attention.
you see that? I've got movement.
he's in there.
we had to move quickly.
agent Hotchner said if we have the shot...
take it.
he's going to the roof.
JJ, cover the back stairs.
Spence. What do you mean, he's gone?
I've got the shot, Agent.
don't take the shot! Don't shoot! I got him!
want to kill me yourself, agent?
why didn't you let him take the shot, Agent?
because a bullet to Ian Doyle's brain would have ended his life too easily?
you wanted him to suffer.
he deserved the same beating he gave Prentiss, but I did not unleash that on him, Senator.
no, you didn't.
instead, your actions put an innocent child's life on the line.
have you ever been in the field?
I have.
but I'm not the one on trial, Agent.
then maybe you can imagine what it was like for Agent Morgan to find Emily Prentiss dying...at the hands of Ian Doyle.
now ask yourself...
was it wrong for him to want to take that man out?
forgotten where I've been, Agent?
places far worse than this.
Doyle, where's Declan?
don't play dumb.
you found him a month before I did.
he's living in that lovely little house our friend set up for him.
I should have found him sooner.
finally remembered she likes cul-de-sacs.
where is Declan right now?
you expect me to believe you had nothing to do with his abduction?
and you expect me to believe this isn't part of the strategy?
you tell me my son is missing when I know he was safe a few hours ago?
you'll have to get more creative.
listen to me, you son of a bitch.
I am not playing games with you.
if you care about anybody other than yourself, you'll give me a list of who would have done this.
why would anyone take Declan?
you tell me.
no one even knows he exists.
someone does.
because when we followed you to that little rat trap, somebody took him from his house.
somebody else was watching you, Doyle. Now tell me who.
I don't know.
I don't.
your son is missing.
so think.
I don't know.
how long has Agent Morgan been looking for Doyle?
the night he killed Prentiss in Boston.
he refused to believe Doyle just vanished.
he's been investigating Doyle for 7 months?
why, are you surprised?
he seems genuine.
well, of course he does.
he's a master manipulator.
see his carotid?
his heart started racing when Morgan told him about Declan.
the tightness in his forehead,
his darting eyes, are signs of real concern.
well, if he didn't take his son, then who did?
damn it.
Rossi, it's me. I just see one ninja-like guy. - You sure?
and just clipped the camera. I'm sorry.
don't worry, Garcia. You were busy looking for Doyle.
she didn't see a team on the footage.
this was well-organized. One could have cut the camera while the other started in here.
so they cut off the power, but no signs of forced entry.
so how do you overpower two armed Agents?
a male and a female.
maybe whoever did this posed as the next shift?
makes sense. Everything about them seems efficient.
except they took the time to shove her in the closet.
so it's personal and professional.
only Declan and the caregiver live here,
so whose stuff is this?
40 long.
you still think Doyle's behind this?
he's capable of a lot of things,
but being two places at once isn't one of them.
Doyle, I'm gonna ask you one last time...
who hates you enough to take him?
how long has it been?
6 hours.
you've had your time to find him.
now let me have mine.
that's not about to happen.
he didn't do it.
no.
what the hell is going on here?
what?
nothing.
has Aaron landed?
he's on his way.
good.
welcome back, sir.
thank you. What have you got?
got a top-10 list of Doyle's enemies.
anybody recently in the states?
richard Gerace's been here a few weeks.
he's a low-level gun-runner who angrily crossed paths with Doyle.
I caught an image of him on the surveillance camera at Declan's house, confirmed it was him through a scar on his neck.
all right. Get me everything you can on Gerace.
Yeah. What I just told you is everything I've got.
well, that's a good look.
how was the desert?
hot.
you seen Jack yet?
no. Jessica took him to Hershey Park for the weekend.
well, he'll love that beard.
Yeah, we skyped every day.
he's not a fan.
Doyle, do you consider Richard Gerace an enemy?
I don't consider him at all.
tell me about him.
gave him a nasty scar in belfast 20 years ago.
hasn't been my problem since.
whose problem was he?
she won't help.
why not?
because I killed her.
he was referring to Agent Prentiss?
that's correct, sir.
the government spent 17, 400 on her funeral and another 642, 000 on medical expenses.
but this is no surprise to you.
Hey. Got your message.
it's time.
Why? Morgan may be able to break Doyle without her.
Declan tried to make a call. She's on the way.
all right. I'll get Morgan.
I'll tell the others.
you get anywhere with Doyle?
Doyle doesn't think Gerace has the guts to take him on.
but that's definitely Gerace on the tape.
welcome back.
Thanks. Everybody have a seat.
Why?
what's going on? Everything all right?
7 months ago I made a decision that affected this team.
as you all know, Emily had lost a lot of blood after her fight with Doyle.
but the doctors were able to stabilize her.
and she was airlifted from Boston to bethesda under a covert exfiltration.
her identity was strictly need-to-know.
and she stayed there until she was well enough to travel.
she was reassigned to Paris where she was given several identities, none of which we had access to for her security.
she's alive?
but we buried her.
as I said, I take full responsibility for the decision.
if anyone has any issues, they should be directed toward me.
any issues?
Yeah, I got issues.
Oh, my god.
at least you've got her back.
did we?
I am so sorry.
I really am.
not a day went by that I didn't want to...
really, I
you didn't deserve that.
and I'm so sorry.
there's so much I want to tell you guys,
and I will. I promise. But right now
I really need to know what's going on with Declan.
Emily, was there a man living at the house?
Yes. My friend Tom Koehler.
he was raising Declan as his own.
where is he? - I never saw him go in or out of that house.
he was on assignment overseas.
but he's all right?
Yes. He's on his way back now.
he got a call from Declan, he called me, and when I landed, Hotch told me that you had Doyle in custody.
and because of Tom's line of work,
that's why you enrolled Declan in a boarding school.
I made sure that he, Louise, and I were the only ones allowed to take him off campus.
Louise took him home last night because he was sick.
food poisoning.
Yeah, a few of the kids had it, apparently.
so whoever did this got to him on campus.
they knew they only had one chance.
current suspect is Richard Gerace.
he's the most recent arrival into the states.
we've been tracking his progress through the city, but we came up empty.
but we know it's him because he has the scar.
that doesn't make sense. Gerace gave up on Doyle a long time ago.
he said you were the only one who knew Gerace.
which is why I'm pretty sure he doesn't have the balls to pull this off.
there was no forced entry at the house?
I had two Agents working security.
we think Gerace and his partner posed as the next shift, and one of the Agents was a woman.
she's the alpha.
so we're looking for a woman who's getting back at Doyle.
and our suspect list just got a whole lot longer.
Doyle had relations with all of these ladies?
most.
Hey, can you shoot these into the roundtable room for me?
anything you say, visitor Prentiss.
Thanks.
so you're actually back.
they've been looking for your replacement,
and Rossi called me.
that's great.
how's Will with the long hours again?
long story.
I haven't seen Ashley.
Oh, well, she transferred to Andi Swann's unit.
good for her.
so, how, uh, angry is the team?
they're in shock.
of course.
thank you.
it is really good to see you.
these women are associates of Doyle's who may have crossed paths with Gerace.
anyone have a deeper personal connection with Doyle?
whoever took Declan showed a lot of rage at the nanny.
she had been with Doyle since before Declan was born.
the nanny represents a caregiver, a mother figure.
who is Declan's mother?
Doyle told me she was dead.
of course.
which one is Declan's mom?
Chloe Donaghy. But she had nothing to do with this.
how do you know?
did you kill her, too?
because she tried to kill Declan before he was ever born.
do you know who I am?
no.
I'm your mum.
she brought tainted cupcakes to the boarding school and just walked right in.
Oh, that is creepy.
we thought Doyle was bad. Check her out.
Yeah, she ran an international prostitution ring before moving on to chemicals.
distribution and trafficking, manufacturing, possession, weapons charges?
went away for 3 years.
that's it?
she hardly seems like the mothering type.
why would she take Declan?
it isn't love.
who were her contacts in the states?
whoever they are, they're as good as dead.
she works her people, sucks 'em dry, and then...
moves on.
she never wanted Declan. Why would she take him?
this is about you, Ian.
you just told me you kept her a prisoner for 9 months.
7
7
did Louise help deliver Declan?
Yes.
that's called revenge, Ian.
Chloe didn't just forget about what you put her through.
she would rather have been dead than to have my baby.
what as I supposed to do?
chaining her to a bed wasn't the answer.
she received a lot of money for her troubles.
that was torture, Ian.
and you don't think she spent years figuring out how to do the same to you?
she took the only thing you love.
what else would she and Gerace have to gain from taking Declan?
money.
that's all she ever cared about.
I need a list of everyone with the kind of money they're looking for, and anyone else who wants to hurt you.
forgetting the international ties for a minute, what would these unsubs do?
you know, statistically the abduction of a child by its mother, no matter the psychological disposition of said mother, would be one of low risk to child.
she's got plenty of connections. She could go underground.
is there anywhere in the U. S.
where Chloe and Doyle had a history?
no. But they do have a lot of ties in Europe.
Doyle came up with associates of Chloe's who have healthy bank accounts.
he thinks it's a trade? For what, weapons? Drugs?
Garcia, run these names.
see if any have local connections.
Yeah. What else should I be looking for, you guys?
secluded properties.
a legitimate business that requires international bank accounts and trade.
it could be mundane. They survive under the radar.
Garcia, start with Irish backgrounds.
this type of feud could go back generations.
it looks like the Doyles and the McDermotts have a thing.
what kind of thing?
Ian Doyle murdered Jimmy McDermott, but his younger brother Lachlan owns an import company.
do they ship internationally?
you know it. He has 3 warehouses,
once of which is slated to be demolished.
where?
inner Harbor, Baltimore.
let's go.
I trust you called the Baltimore city police.
no, sir.
certainly the Harbor police.
no, sir.
why didn't you?
the last I checked, it takes and hour to drive from headquarters to Baltimore.
and I see your phones were working.
he's gone.
over here!
Doyle said Chloe would clean house.
so what the hell is she doing now?
she's getting out of the country.
Gerace was dead weight.
she thinks she's gonna get more for the kid without him.
Yeah.
Declan's disappeared.
they had him at the warehouse, but now they're gone.
your ex is working with Lachlan McDermott.
how would he leave the country?
I don't know.
he's got endless funds. You'll never stop him.
he hates you, doesn't he?
more than you do.
then I think we should give him what he really wants.
you.
you're the one who suggested Ian Doyle be released.
I am.
and you're the only agent who has not requested
reinstatement to the unit.
was the decision to release Ian Doyle a personal one?
a young boy's life was at stake.
I ran the probability of his survival and it wasn't good.
if you want to punish me for taking a risk, then I encourage you to do that, but do not put the rest of my team on trial for something that I suggested.
calm down, agent.
this is calm, and it's doctor.
no, we are not letting him out of here, Reid.
Emily, I will chain myself to him if I have to.
he'll find a way to escape.
no, he won't, and we're running out of time.
if we find McDermott now, we have a chance to save Declan.
the United States government is not in the business of trading captives.
new York city, July 2010, referred to as the spy swap. Igor
that's enough.
you can't just change the rules, sir.
and you just can't break them.
is Strauss still there?
she is.
we need full support.
Doyle said McDermott's family imported weapons to a private airfield in Maryland.
close? - Largo.
all right, send me the coordinates.
I fully understand that, ma'am,
but I'm telling you, it's only a matter of minutes before they leave the country with him.
but what makes you think they won't take off with Doyle and his son?
we won't let that happen.
you can't guarantee that.
I am certain that without this move, there is a very good chance
that little boy is going to die.
the team's already on their way, aren't they?
Yes, ma'am.
down there.
he looks just like his father.
it makes me sick.
so what are you gonna do with him?
I didn't think you cared.
I don't.
you were supposed to get me Doyle.
what can I say? The feds beat me to it.
he'll have to do. As long as the kid's alive,
Doyle will find a way to get to him.
unless he gets killed in custody.
you played Gerace. You're not gonna play me, too.
I don't know what this is.
lachlan McDermott and Chloe Donaghy, this is FBI.
you called the feds?
why would I do that?
we know you have Declan.
to ensure his safety we would like to trade.
we will give you Ian Doyle.
and you send us the boy.
this--this was not our deal.
not, but it just got interesting.
you're not leaving.
get over there, boy.
bring Doyle here!
I want him here on his knees!
Hotch, are we really gonna do this?
no one leaves here.
you bastard.
how's it feeling?
it's your bloody time now, isn't it?
now hand him over.
gun!
I remember you.
sorry, son.
this team took many unprecedented risks.
none were approved.
the diog has rules, and you chose to ignore every last one.
that's blatant disrespect to the Bureau and to authority of law in general.
what I find interesting is that you are the experts in behavior but find nothing wrong with yours.
may I?
the journey was not traditional, but this team neutralized 4 international criminals and saved the life of a young boy in the process.
you started a war with Ian Doyle years ago that this team and the U. S. Government had to finish.
the rest of you are dismissed.
agent prentiss, we're not done.
I never thought we'd be taking one of these down.
I already tried. It's screwed in.
you're kidding me.
I got this.
perfect.
I also have Sergio.
Oh, I knew you would.
I need visitation rights.
he's a love, isn't he?
Yeah, he's takes after his mom.
Morgan.
I know what you've been through.
I understand that you're angry,
but I hope that you understand that this is not about you...or me.
this was about saving Emily.
we need to talk.
the committee made it clear they will not support a rogue team.
agent prentiss convinced them you were not that.
they will be watching you closely.
so I suggest you play by their rules.
so we're ok?
suspension is lifted for everyone.
thank you, ma'am.
there may be more paperwork, considering your...
situation.
but the team is lucky to have you,
if you're interested.
may I think about it?
of course.
I'm in.
I have a stack of cases on my desk.
I'm happy to pass them all off to you.
I'll pick them up in the morning.
Emily, uh...
what did you tell them?
the only people I know who could accomplish that mission just walked out.
they do their jobs with integrity,
and most importantly, they honor their oath.
I will support and defend "The constitution of the united states of america "Against all enemies, "Foreign and domestic."
I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same, "That I take this obligation freely, "Without any mental reservation "Or purpose of evasion."
that I will well and faithfully "Discharge the duties of the office "On which I am about to enter,
so help me god.
guess who I went to second base with.
who, Cy?
Lyla Smith.
bull!
get back here! Why don't you believe me?
because you lie!
I grew up normal, in a normal house, the size of a castle.
I played sports...
sang in the choir, for the president of the United States...
and celebrated my birthdays with 4-story cakes, flown straight from Paris.
my brother and I played kickball over there.
and--and here is where we would hide from the police after stealing magic potions from the toy store.
I don't know why they wouldn't believe me when I told them we were gonna make things with it.
I still build things now.
I--I took apart a 1961 DeSoto, and built a generator from scratch.
it's so powerful,
it could light a Springsteen concert.
but for now, it just lights my room.
what are you-- what are you doing?
I don't understand.
I'll do anything. Please, don't hurt me.
why would I hurt you?
no, no, no, no, no, no!
so you finished the course?
and completed my case rotation.
Hotch says he's never seen a rookie profiler analyze and write up cases as well as you.
he said that?
Yeah. Well, after all the cases you presented over the years, I'm not surprised.
Hey, where have you been? I wanted to do brunch this weekend.
I had to deal with some stuff with my mom.
have you seen Garcia?
uh, she's with Rossi.
he hates me.
mm, he was just busy.
let it go.
OK, you can be honest. I can take it.
OK. I prefer my pasta al dente, and the pancetta was a little weird.
Oh. That's 'cause it's tofu.
tofu? I give you my recipe and you do an improv?
no, no, I followed it down to the micron, aside from the pig.
look, master of all things Italian,
I am having a Fellini Festival at my house this weekend and I must serve the beautiful food of his country.
maybe you should show a Disney film and stick with burgers.
you know, Rossi, you could always give Penelope a cooking lesson.
Oh, my gosh, that would be amazing.
that would be like
that would be like the iron chef meets the BAU.
and we could do it at your house.
I don't have a house,
I have a mansion.
all right, let's get started.
all right.
you are jetting to Durant, Oklahoma, because in the last 3 days, two women have been found dead after being sexually tortured and then blinded with a sulfuric acid solution.
Abby Elcott is our first victim, 19-year-old art student.
she was headed to campus for an advanced drawing class.
she'd been missing for two days.
same goes for our second victim, Beth Westerly, 17.
she had just finished her coffee shop shift and was on her way to a bar method class.
both low-risk victims.
and physically similar.
how close are the two abduction sites?
5 miles apart at bus stops.
Abby's cell was found near one,
Beth's scarf near the other.
where are the dump sites?
one in an alley, the other in a field.
so he stapled their eyes open, then he blinded them.
it's about power and control.
maybe he didn't to want them to watch while he hurt them.
or it could be about shame.
perhaps the unsub is disfigured himself.
blinding the victims leaves them helpless, lost, totally dependent.
it may be a manifestation of how he sees himself in this world.
it is a form of enucleation, just without the scalpel.
his face is the last they see before darkness.
Garcia, come up with a list of jobs that would give the unsub access to sulfuric acid.
the rest of us, wheels up in 30 minutes.
and this is where my brother lives now.
there you are, Cy.
I got you clothes.
bought you some shampoo and toothpaste.
see? We're the perfect American story.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ok. Turn that thing off, come on in.
come on.
every story has a beginning.
but the part I like best is the end.
if it is a miracle, "Any sort of evidence will answer."
but if it is a fact, proof is necessary.
mark Twain.
victimology is very similar.
blond-haired, blue-eyed teenage girls.
we believe they were each abducted near public transportation stops.
when was this photo taken?
Beth was caught on a bank surveillance camera 3 hours before she disappeared.
that's a recent photo of Abby.
so she wasn't found in the same clothes she was abducted in.
maybe he changed them because hers were burned by the sulfuric acid.
it's possible. Sulfuric acid can turn human flesh into soap.
Garcia, any recent similar cases in the surrounding area?
actually, yes. Two months ago a prostitute and a runaway were both found raped and killed and they had stab wounds to their eyes.
so maybe he practiced on high-risk victims first.
and then advanced to chemical enucleation.
isn't that a rare paraphilia?
well, the chemical part is. It would exacerbate the pain.
like Ed Kemper, he's probably practicing on surrogates before going after the real object of his rage.
Dave, you and I will talk to the parents.
morgan and prentiss, go to the disposal sites.
JJ, you and Reid to the abduction sites.
so Beth got off the bus here and headed northwest toward class.
it's amazing no one witnessed her abduction.
Emily was buried 6 feet under and wound up in Paris,
so I guess anything's possible, right?
so that is what this is about.
maybe our unsub's a little bit like Bundy.
he feigns injury in order to get her to help him.
look, Spence, if you want to talk about this
maybe he tried other tactics, like, "Wow, you're really pretty."
you should be a model. I can take your photo.
I'll take that as a no.
either one would disarm her.
charm is quite the killer.
so are tears. Whatever his ruse was, the unsub mostly likely used it to get her into his vehicle.
well, if Abby was last seen at a bus stop a few miles away, then he definitely has a means of transportation.
hopefully the disposal site will tell us more.
so what do you have, detective Bonner?
Beth's body was found over there.
you smell the urine?
I thought that was air freshener.
there's drugstore food everywhere.
it's a homeless corridor.
Abby was found in a shantytown as well.
so, our unsub hunts and travels through the areas unnoticed, blending in with his surroundings.
this guy's either homeless or appears to be.
he most likely has a car, to get them from the abduction site to here.
just because you're homeless doesn't mean you're carless.
it could explain why he chose high-risk victims at first.
they were all around him.
he had her for two days?
I can't even imagine what she went through.
why did he blind her?
that's what we're trying to figure out.
I know this is difficult, but I need you to look at the clothes that Abby was wearing when we found her.
do you recognize them?
do you find anything odd about Beth's clothing?
they're not Abby's.
you sure?
I saw her that morning.
she had on a brown and pink sweater.
Beth wouldn't wear denim shorts.
they aren't her style.
you're sure?
in addition to the blinding, taking their clothes further robs them of their identity.
he's either keeping their garments as souvenirs
or re-dressing the victims as a forensic countermeasure.
dressing them in these outfits could be part of the fantasy.
where do homeless people get their clothes?
churches, thrift stores. We need to rule everything out.
I'm a plane! I'm a plane!
you are now entering Dallas International Airport.
please hold on to your flotation device and fasten your seatbelts!
Cy, your stuff is right there.
Oh, minty fresh. I like minty fresh.
we keep buying you toothbrushes, but you clearly aren't using them.
instead of crashing here every now and again,
why don't you just move in?
I like to be free.
last night I had a date with two hot twins.
is that so?
why don't you believe me?
remember when he said he dated Cyndi Lauper in high school?
I did, I did, I did!
how many times do I have to tell you?
a million, 'cause you always lie.
Hey, guys.
Hi. Hey, uncle Cy.
Tammy, how was practice?
I hit two home runs.
Hey, mom, what's the deal with my dress?
on your bed.
Really?
Where's she going?
homecoming's tomorrow night.
I loved homecoming.
well, we'll be taking pictures before she leaves.
why don't you stop by?
Oh, and maybe I could tape it.
no, that's ok, Cy. You don't have to.
why not? It'll be fun.
no, no, no. What would be fun would be if you and I take a break.
I can see the doctor's working.
counseling's worth every penny.
excuse me.
do you know where Church Street is?
uh, you're on Church Street.
I am?
See...You're standing right here.
just walk. Just walk. Come on.
this way. Come on.
Reid and JJ went to the local thrift shop and found Abby's clothes.
so he sold them.
or traded them for the eighties clothing.
the sales clerk said the clothes in the crime scene photos were of that time period, and he confirmed that they were purchased from his store.
so if he's getting rid of his souvenirs.
what's he using to remember his victims?
and why is he fixated on this era?
what do you got?
the brutality the victims experienced was immense.
multiple stab wounds to the neck and chest, plus wounds to the genital.
frustration and overkill.
the same chemical damage on the skin is also around her nostrils.
he poured the sulfuric acid there as well.
and that would destroy their sense of smell, yes?
Absolutely.
he didn't do that to the first victim.
no, he's escalating.
and blinding isn't his only signature.
no, he's trying to take away their senses.
I like when women scream.
it reminds me of the roller coaster.
I like roller coasters.
especially in the summertime.
somebody please help me!
somebody!
what? You don't like the way I taste?!
No!
well, I can help you with that.
please, please...
somebody help me!
somebody please help me!
no, no. No...
again he's disposing in an area frequented by homeless people.
it's equidistant to the last two dump sites.
he burned her tongue with the chemical this time.
so he removed her ability to taste.
why would he do that?
historically this kind of torture was used to prevent someone from revealing a secret.
maybe she offended him.
I wonder what that's like.
her lips are extremely chapped.
she was probably forced to repeatedly participate in some sort of kissing fantasy.
and when things go awry, he takes the offending sense away.
he tortured her in these clothes, which means the eighties are essential to his delusion.
maybe that's when this rejection occurred and he held on to the clothes all these years.
and now he's attacking girls who remind him of women from that time.
he's fixated on her type and remakes them fit his fantasy.
but why start now?
something probably triggered it,
and instead of dealing with it, he's acting out.
we believe the unsub or unknown subject that we're looking for is a white male in his 40s.
this is someone who's reacting to rejection by a woman when he was teenager in the 1980s.
he's punishing his victims for their reactions to him by taking away their senses with sulfuric acid.
we believe our unsub could possibly work part-time as a janitor or a mechanic, which would give him access to this chemical.
and after studying the disposal sites,
we think it's likely that he is homeless.
now, how do we typically react toward the homeless?
we judge them by their looks and smells.
it's that same negative reaction we believe that a woman had toward the unsub at some point in the eighties.
the unsub's fixation on this woman is now all-consuming.
it's caused him to develop obsessive love disorder.
he most likely has tunnel vision and believes that she holds the key to his happiness.
he will stalk her in an attempt to win her back.
he will do whatever it takes to be near his love interest.
but her rejection will spiral him into a depression.
which would lead to rape and murder
of the surrogates who represent her.
and it's only a matter of time before this rage and anger causes the unsub to go after her directly.
let's go, let's fight, let's win tonight!
let's go, let's fight, let's win tonight!
Lyla? - Let's go, let's fight, let's win tonight!
you've got to be kidding!
give me a break, Cy.
leave me alone, Matt!
Tammy?
Hello!
Spence. Look, we gotta talk about this.
I don't want to talk about it.
I get it, ok? You're disappointed with the way we handled Emily.
listen, I have a lot going on, all right?
you know what I think it is? - What?
you're mad that Hotch and I controlled our micro-expressions at the hospital and you weren't able to detect our deception.
you think it's about my profiling skills?
Jennifer, listen, the only reason you were able to manage my perceptions is because I trusted you. I came to your house for 10 weeks in a row crying over losing a friend, and not once did you have the decency to tell me the truth.
I couldn't.
you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
no, I couldn't.
what if I started taking dilaudid again?
would you have let me?
you didn't.
Yeah, but I thought about it.
Spence.
I'm sorry.
it's too late, all right?
Reid.
Oh, Cy, why don't you just crash here?
I may for a bit.
you know, if mom and dad were alive, they'd make you.
you ought to try and have a nice life.
I have a nice life.
when things get bad, I go out on this ship made of clay.
of clay, Cy?
last night I took another girl out on it.
yeah? When can we meet her?
never.
she's dead to me.
what do you think?
I lightened my hair in your honor, mom.
Oh, my, you're beautiful!
Where's the camera?
you look just like your mom did in high school.
that's 'cause I'm wearing the same dress.
mom cut it shorter.
so, can I stay out till 2: 00?
nice try. You can go to the dance and then the party at the motel, but Debbie's mom's picking you up at midnight.
OK. - Ok.
have fun.
thank you.
it would have had to have been a woman very close to the unsub to make him react this way.
then why go after surrogates?
I don't think we're dealing with a typical homeless person.
he's good with chemicals, owns a car.
I think the only mistake in our profile was assuming there was something wrong with his physical composition, reducing him to some sort of stereotype.
you think it's only his mental state?
I think this guy might be smart enough to use his disability to his advantage so he comes across as harmless.
then when he's alone and the victim rejects him, he goes off.
what if he doesn't live on the street?
what if he's in a halfway house?
Garcia, I need a list of halfway houses and mental health centers in the unsub's comfort zone.
OK. 5 are being sent to your phones.
which of those were around in the eighties, Garcia?
there are two in your area.
morgan and Prentiss, take the first.
Dave and I will take the second.
what about us?
stay here and check VICAP for similar M. O.S and signatures.
Reid.
if you want to be mad at someone, be mad at me.
I can't. I didn't come to your house crying for 10 weeks.
I've worked here over 15 years.
there are many people who fit that description.
this guy would be mobile, probably early 40s.
well, if he's got a car, then he's transitioned out in the last few years.
state budget cuts.
all right, we'll need a list of those names.
it ain't gonna be small.
Hey, Morgan.
what do I do about Reid?
Emily, there's a lot about you being back that's unresolved.
are you pissed at me, too?
come on, now.
how can I be? You're here.
thank you.
because I know what you went through.
grief counseling. You carried my coffin.
Yeah, I sure did. What was in that thing, anyway?
I don't know.
here you go.
thank you very much.
look,
just give Reid some time.
he'll be fine.
Thanks.
Yeah, Hotch, it's me, Morgan. Listen, 19 people entered this house in the eighties who were let out in the last 5 years.
we got 11 from the one we visited.
send your names to Garcia. Have her cross-check them against jobs that use sulfuric acid.
all right. We'll start reaching out to the extended families.
OK.
how's Reid?
he's angry and frustrated.
I'm surprised everybody isn't.
some of us had an inkling.
what? I'm good at what I do.
so, are you gonna get psychological counseling for the team or handle it internally?
no, I think that if we all just got together, maybe a cooking lesson and at the home of one of our founders
Oh, no, not you, too.
it could boost morale.
is this an order?
no, it's just a-- it's a very tempered suggestion.
tempered suggestion.
Hey, you all right?
Yeah. Thanks, Debbie. I just
I just need a minute.
Tammy?
uncle Cy?
what are you doing here?
I--I was just going to buy some beer.
you ok?
no.
maybe I should take you home.
I don't want to get in trouble with mom and dad.
you won't.
I'll take care of you.
so we interviewed the 19 people released from the group home.
none of them fit the profile.
Dave's still trying to locate the families.
Tammy Bradstone's parents just filed a report.
their daughter didn't return from homecoming last night.
her face is similar to our 3 vics.
she's about the same age.
well, the after party where she was last seen was smack in the comfort zone.
where are her parents now?
they're at the house.
we're bringing her friends in for questioning.
you head over there. We'll start the interviews here.
I see on the news on the tv, people question, they question why people do this.
it's the same reason people do anything.
cause they feel like it. They like the way it feels.
when I was kid, my dog Poppy running across the grass, when I hit her, I liked that feeling.
that has not changed.
somebody help me!
help!
uncle Cy?
what's happening?
what did you do to me?
so kids spill out of the motel toward the cars.
if Tammy walked this way, how could she disappear without anyone seeing her?
someone would have heard her scream.
that's if she screamed.
unlike the last 3 abduction sites, this one is nowhere near public transportation.
maybe she knew the unsub.
or thought she did.
what if--what if Tammy was the target all along?
that would explain the change in the M. O.
so whoever did this knew she was coming here.
Hi, hi, hi.
Hey, baby girl, I need you to work that magic for me.
anything, my sweetest.
I just opened up Tammy Bradstone's computer.
I want you to check her emails, web searches, and anyone she may have skyped.
OK, typing at the speed of thought.
Thanks, mama.
are you gonna find my sister?
we're gonna try, little man.
listen, uh, did your sister dye her hair recently?
Yeah. To look nice for the homecoming dance.
she was even gonna wear the same dress my mom did.
are you sure that Tammy hasn't been behaving differently lately?
she's 16, so she's pretty closed off.
your daughter seems to cherish hanging out in groups, so there's no way she would run off with someone unless she knew them.
what about her computer?
nothing out of the ordinary, and Hotch cleared the boyfriend.
do you know anyone who is transient or mentally ill?
uh, yeah, my brother.
he didn't get enough oxygen to his brain when he was born.
what's his name?
cy Bradstone.
on the halfway house list, all I got was a Ben Bradstone.
Oh, no, yeah, that's his real name.
cy is the name he made up.
where does he live?
he crashes here from time to time, but he's basically homeless.
his frontal lobe damage is one of the indicators of serial killers.
cy isn't a serial killer.
he wouldn't hurt anybody, especially not my daughter.
come on.
come on!
just a little bit further.
I want to tell you a story.
has Cy ever acted inappropriately toward Tammy?
no. I wouldn't let him in here if he had.
OK, so he sleeps here sometimes, and his head is on this side.
that puts the TV out of his sight.
since when is that a crime?
well, it just gives him a full view of the kitchen.
does Tammy cook for him?
no. Lyla does.
ma'am, what's your relationship with Cy?
I've known him since 10th grade.
that was 1985.
he makes you uncomfortable, doesn't he?
did you have blond hair in high school?
Yes. What are you getting at?
sir, your daughter just dyed her hair blond.
you allowed her to wear your dress.
I'm just thinking it may have triggered something for Cy.
what happened with you and Cy that made him so angry?
honey, what is it?
when I was 16, my friends and I went to a party after homecoming.
everyone had been drinking.
damn. I'm seeing stars.
let's play spin the bottle.
when it was your mom's turn, she spun it and it landed on me.
you should have seen her face.
she lit up like-- like a lite brite.
I didn't know what to do.
my friends laughed, but I didn't want to be mean, so I...
went in the closet with him.
and what happened next?
I let him feel me up.
how did he behave after that?
he started following me around at school.
then one day he overheard me tell a friend how gross I thought he was.
how he talked, how he smelled?
why didn't you tell me this?
I was 16.
we had just started dating.
does Cy know about your recent marital problems?
I told him a couple months ago.
and then he probably started making advances towards you, which you had to reject.
that's what triggered the killings.
I did this?
no. No, ma'am.
the events did.
does Cy have a part-time job?
Yeah, he works at a couple garages.
one on Drake, the other on Fourth.
that explains the sulfuric acid.
we'll need those addresses.
OK. Excuse me.
OK, so, as long as Tammy doesn't do anything to antagonize him, we may have a chance.
Oh, my god.
it's you!
you're the one that my mom told me about.
Uh-huh. Yes.
you took advantage of her when she was drunk at a party.
no, that's--that's not true.
Yes.
that's probably why she won't touch you now.
that's why she won't touch me?
Yeah. Because you forced yourself on her.
you shouldn't have done that, Tammy.
you should have kept your mouth shut!
you won't get away with this, uncle Cy.
they'll find you.
they can't find me, Tammy.
they're not looking for me.
when Cy comes to the house, he gets out of the car and he goes to the door.
Yeah.
how do you know he's here?
I can hear his truck.
so then you head to the front door.
Yes.
there you are, Cy.
when you open it, what do you smell?
he smells musty, like he needs to take a shower.
are you sure that's all you smell?
I smell chemicals.
he smells like chemicals.
what does he do next?
he crushes a cup, and-- and he puts it in his bag.
Where's it from? Is there a name on the cup?
it's a soda from a coffee shop.
the Way Station.
it's down the street.
OK. He probably stops there every time he comes here.
what days would those be?
monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Sometimes Saturday.
which means he'd be coming today.
I need you to leave a message for him there.
I'm going to go get us something to eat.
don't worry, Tammy.
there are other sports to play.
any luck?
he hasn't been to either of the mechanics' shops in the past two months.
but the one on Fourth said a bunch of car batteries had gone missing.
wait
yeah?
Morgan, it's from a pay phone near a coffee shop.
it's him.
OK, go ahead. Just like we talked about.
Hello?
Hi, it's Cy.
Paulie said you were looking for me.
Lyla, what's wrong, Lyla?
Matt got arrested.
what? Lyla, what are you talking about?
they think that he hurt Tammy.
Oh, god, Cy.
I need you.
don't--don't cry.
Lyla, don't--don't cry.
everything's gonna be all right.
I just--I--I need you to, uh, come over here and
I need you to talk. I need you to hold me.
you--you do?
Yes. I
hurry. I have no one else to turn to.
I'll be there, Lyla. I'll be there.
he's coming.
you and Prentiss stay with them.
morgan and I will get the front.
Lyla!
Lyla.
it's gonna be ok.
it's gonna be ok.
cy Bradstone! FBI! Put your hands where I can see them!
let me see your hands!
on your knees, now!
how could you do this to me?
get up.
how could you do this to me?!
stop moving. Stop it!
we need to know where Tammy is, Cy.
we've looked in your car. There's no sign of her.
we know this isn't about Tammy.
this is about your love for Lyla.
Lyla?
Lie-la!
you and Lyla had a pretty good secret all these years.
how'd she get you to shut up about it?
one time.
that's all I needed.
is that where you, uh, did it, Cy?
is that the same place you took Tammy?
we know when you saw her in that dress, it made you think of Lyla.
Tammy's not the one you want to hurt, Cy.
Lyla's the one that should be punished.
she's the one who made you feel like a freak.
a reject, a weirdo.
tell us where Tammy is, Cy, and we can be done.
done?
finished.
finished?
well, I can--I can do that.
under one condition.
now, where's Tammy, Cy?
what did you do with my daughter?
Lyla was an angel.
like--like a prize in the crackerjack box.
when she would come into the room, my heart would race.
when I saw Tammy in that dress, it took me back there.
Cy, just tell me where she is.
I took her. We did things.
everything was going good un-until she said those words.
what did she say, Cy?
she said...
she said the reason her mother always backed up when I came over was because she didn't want to feel me touching her.
so guess what I did, Matt.
you guess!
what did you do, Cy?
I made it so she couldn't feel either.
she screamed so loud.
but no one could hear her.
where do you have her?
the same place I told him about my love.
guess who I went to second base with.
who, Cy?
Lyla Smith.
bull!
get back here.
why don't you believe me?
because you lie!
you never told me that.
Yes, I did, yes, I did, yes, I did!
but you thought I was lying and then you married my girl!
so this is what you do, Cy? Why didn't you just hurt me?
I take away your senses, Matt.
the last one is hearing.
and if I take that, you wouldn't be able to listen to what I did to her.
you son of a bitch! You taped-- you taped my daughter?!
you son of a bitch! You son of a bitch!
you son of a bitch!
clear!
she's got a pulse. I need a medic in here!
Oh, Jeez.
Scott Adams wrote, "Nothing inspires forgiveness quite like revenge."
so, the surgeon said he believes he can restore feeling to Tammy's hands.
good. We got there in time.
I heard Mr. Bradstone wants to watch the tape.
people have an innate curiosity to see things in order to confirm them.
Oh, that explains why I'm going to Rossi's tomorrow night.
I want to see if he really can cook.
you coming?
I don't know. I'm not so sure I can make it.
look, Reid, I know you're mad at us
because we didn't tell you what really happened,
and I understand that.
but I promise you, we had no choice.
you mourned the loss of a friend.
I mourned the loss of 6.
this whole thing gave me an ulcer.
please don't give me another one.
are you gonna go to Rossi's tomorrow?
we'll see.
now, Matt, you might not want to watch this.
but this is what I'm going to do to your daughter.
but what I did with your wife, now, that's a tape you should see.
cooking is the most sensual art form.
and these are my paints.
so your hands must be brushes.
don't interrupt.
in a pot of boiling water we cook our spaghetti until it's al dente, firm to the tooth.
here you go. Everybody pass it around.
see? Feel the texture. There we go. Ok.
now...
in a large pan, we fry up our pancetta.
keeping a sharp eye that the edges are crisp.
but careful not to burn the onions.
Bravo, Aaron!
we saute until translucence.
uh--I got it.
now, we mix in the eggs...
the parmesan...
the spaghett...
and parsley.
you see, it's all about timing and rhythm.
and if you don't feel yourself doing it properly, please, order a pizza.
sorry I'm late.
Yeah. And this is why I cook alone.
so, uh, when do we get to drink the wine?
almost there.
OK. We start at the beginning.
you eat what you cook,
I'll supervise,
but we're gonna do this all together,
just like a family.
OK now?
now.
he came after me. He came to my home.
Sarah's dead. He butchered her.
your team is in trouble.
did you fly a disturbed college student to meet with a man you believed to be a serial killer?
it was my decision.
give me your badge.
you're suspended for 2 weeks pending an investigation.
there's no satisfactory explanation what I've done.
I just don't understand it any of it anymore.
what are you doing here?
Gideon didn't answer his phone.
I called him twice.
have you been here all night?
we were supposed to play chess.
here?
uh, he hasn't been back to his apartment since, um...
right.
I need to brief the team, so...
is Hotch here?
uh, he's not due for a half hour.
Thanks, honey. - Yeah.
are you sure you're ok?
Yeah, I'm fine.
you're doing the right thing.
I know.
getting suspended was a blessing in disguise.
we deserve a normal life.
I love you. - I love you, too.
what, no Hotch, now no Gideon?
no, not yet.
these guys have been out 2 weeks.
you'd think the least they could do is be on time.
Yeah, because you're never late.
so where's Prentiss?
her phone keeps going straight to voicemail.
well, this room just keeps getting smaller and smaller, doesn't it?
should we wait 15 minutes?
we can just brief them on the plane.
right now the police taskforce in Milwaukee needs our help.
they've had 4 murders over the past 3 weeks, and in addition, another woman has been missing the last 2 days.
they've all the women are in their 30s, married with children.
any connection between these victims?
just that they've all been abducted from the area of Wauwatosa, all from very public places, but there's no witnesses.
how are we even certain it's the same killer?
well, for starters...
all of the bodies have been dumped in the city's third ward.
and there's this.
is that what I think it is?
all the hearts have been cut from their bodies.
george Washington said: let your heart feel for the affliction and distress of everyone.
Hey, am I glad to see you.
where you headed?
milwaukee. Looks like another one.
I'll catch you up on the flight.
I'm meeting with the section chief.
OK, so I'll wait.
I'm just glad you're back.
trust me when I tell you things have been a little bit shaky around here.
Morgan, I'm requesting a transfer.
is that a joke?
no, it's not a joke.
Strauss has suspended me once already. The writing's on the wall.
Hotch, we both know that suspension was bogus.
you'll get a new unit chief.
what if we don't want a new unit chief?
well, maybe the next one won't be such a drill sergeant.
look, man, are you a pain in my ass? Yes, sir.
but wanting to hang out with you and needing you to lead this team are two very different things.
it's been a privilege.
I was hoping you'd do the right thing.
have you given any thought to what department you'll request?
I was under the impression that if I left the B. A.U. I'd have my choice of posts.
well, I'll consider it after I fully complete my investigation.
you were a prosecutor.
what about heading up a white collar crime taskforce?
that'll get you home at nights at a reasonable hour.
sorry to interrupt.
sir, I've decided to resign from the FBI, effective immediately.
I don't understand.
I'm taking a foreign service exam.
with my connections, I stand a good chance of landing in the state department.
Prentiss, I think that's a mistake.
well, don't try to talk me out of it.
Garcia saw my name on the list and she already tried.
if she can't talk someone out of doing something, no one can.
sorry for the interruption.
but, sir, it's good to see you back.
the team needs you. Ma'am.
I'll be overseeing this case until I can assign a replacement.
you don't have any field experience.
my job is to protect the bureau.
if I have to hold the team's hand for one case, so be it.
ma'am, in order to function effectively, this team needs stability.
the B. A.U. Has some very talented people and they're bureau assets.
and I believe it's time that they were out from underneath you and Jason Gideon.
you know, from this angle, she almost looks human.
has anyone talked to Emily yet?
she was gone before I heard the news.
I told you, Reid, now we're down 2 agents and Gideon's M. I.A.
doesn't Strauss ever do any......
correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe it's protocol to brief everyone before we arrive at the crime scene.
Yes, ma'am.
this unsub is abducting women from very public places, with no witnesses.
he holds them 48 hours, with no sexual assault, and then he dumps their bodies with their hearts carved out of their chests.
there's an obvious dichotomy in the skill the unsub exhibits in abducting these women and the fact that he cuts their hearts out so crudely.
we're probably looking at someone in a psychotic break.
could be a butcher. Might be a hunter.
somebody who's very comfortable being around blood, but as you can see, he obviously doesn't have the skills of a surgeon.
so do we have a working theory?
sure we do.
somebody really doesn't like women.
is it appropriate to ask whether I could talk you out of it?
heard you got a bigger office.
a swanky new map and everything.
it's the Milwaukee file.
J. J. wanted me to give it to you.
I'm not working it.
I'm just following orders.
they found a new body this morning.
the others are headed straight to the scene.
you the FBI?
Spencer Reid, Jennifer Jareau, and section chief Strauss.
vic Wolynski, Milwaukee pd.
you worked the Jeffrey Dahmer case.
16 years ago. I've studied it.
and you remember my name?
he remembers everything.
it what he does.
what can you tell us?
uh, local merchant noticed her a few hours ago.
uh, but considering he didn't see her when he first came to work, uh, we figure she was dumped there between 7: 50 and 8: 05.
same window as the others.
all the bodies were found in this area, right?
uh, Wauwatosa is an upper-middle-class suburb approximately 15 minutes from here.
all the women were abducted from there in the afternoon and turned up here in the morning 2 days later.
all this foot traffic and no one saw anything.
well, he, up, wraps the bodies, uh, loosely so they're not immediately recognizable.
eventually the, uh, wrapping comes open my guess is he, uh, has a van or a truck, something he can back up so he's shielded when he makes the drop.
no prints on whatever he wraps them in?
there have been traces of paint and wood stain, but most of it is just common stuff you'd get at any hardware store.
he's trying to demean them, putting them out like trash.
this guy might work or live around here.
gets off on the reaction to his... handiwork.
what can you tell us about the victim?
she was taken from a supermarket.
her husband says that most days she would have been picking up her son at school, but he was spending the afternoon at a friend's.
this is your fifth victim, right? - Yes.
you should have called us sooner.
I thought we had a handle on it.
apparently not. - Ma'am.
excuse me, sir.
we need to work with these detectives.
I'm sorry?
we don't generally criticize them.
it just really doesn't get us anything.
are you saying it wouldn't be helpful if he had contacted us sooner?
well, of course.
it's always, you know, the sooner the better. - Right.
and agent Jareau...
don't question me again.
is Jack still napping?
I thought this was over.
it is. I'm just curious.
Hello?
Hello?
what did the section chief say?
she suggested that I transfer to a white collar crime taskforce.
would you have to travel?
no, I'd have a 9: 00 to 5: 00 life.
then it's a no-brainer.
Hey. - How's it going?
well, Strauss just offended the lead detective 45 seconds into her first crime scene.
I'm not surprised.
this isn't about to get any better, is it?
I doubt it.
Morgan, listen, I've been looking at the file.
milwaukee schools start at 8: 10 and they get out at 3: 10.
every abduction has taken place within 15 minutes of school getting out.
and each body was dumped within 15 minutes of the first bell.
we could easily be looking at somebody who works in the school system.
OK. Thanks, man.
any idea how's he's getting control of these women? Is he blitzing them or coercing them?
so far we're coming up blank. - Ok.
keep me posted.
you scared me.
I'm looking for my dad.
are you lost? - I'm not lost.
I'm just not sure where I am.
OK. Maybe I can help you?
are you sure this is what your dad said?
he said if anything happened, to meet him on the side because it wouldn't be so crowded.
Hey. Hey.
Hey, there you are.
Hey, guy, I was worried.
Hi. - Hi.
I'm sorry I tricked you. My dad's just shy.
I want you to smile and ask if you can come home with us, or I'm gonna gut the boy like a deer.
would you mind if I came home with you?
I'd like that.
well, then.
Hey. What do we know?
woman's name is Claire Thompson.
husband tried to reach her on the cell phone.
when she didn't pick up, he drove to the department store.
car's in the parking lot, but she's not inside.
is that the husband? - Yeah.
J. J.Take Strauss with you.
I had the department store uplink the security footage to your analyst in Quantico. - Perfect
my desk is over here.
Garcia, baby girl, please tell me something I want to hear.
you're a statuesque god of sculpted chocolate thunder.
how about something I don't already know?
I have a sweet tooth?
did you locate the missing girl on the security footage?
on it. It's coming your way in 5, 4,3, 2...
I got it.
keep me on speaker, will you?
she doesn't seem to be on anyone's radar.
look. Who's the kid?
does Claire Thompson have a son?
no. 2 - year - old daughter.
it looks like the kid's lost.
Garcia, this all you got? - That's it.
they turn down a hallway without no security camera and we lose them.
I'll get a list of missing kids, see if we can make out a resemblance to any of them.
Oh, damn. - What?
something Hotch said.
all the abductions and disposals have been timed around school.
we thought the unsub might work in the system.
what if this guy's actually using his own son to lure his victims?
detective Wolynski told us you're trying to single out trucks and vans.
that's smart.
the unsub is dumping his victims in the business district, so I'd agree with you
he's probably not driving something that would stand out.
he may even have some type of company logo on the side of his vehicle as well.
we know that he abducts the women in Wauwatosa and dumps their bodies somewhere in the third ward.
most unsubs keep their area of control-- where they kill their victims
triangulated between the two points.
which means that the unsub probably lives in Wauwatosa or the third ward.
somewhere in that area.
and the people who live there know the unsub.
there's no sexual component to these crimes, which means it's more about the unsub making a point.
he's cutting their hearts out.
it might just be that this is the sickest way the unsub knows to disfigure the women and...
throw them out like trash. We can't really know.
the two most important questions to ask ourselves are:
what is this guy doing with these women for 48 hours?
and why is he willing to use his own son to abduct them?
and if he is truly using his own son, then it's likely that he has what we call borderline personality disorder.
now, borderlines-- they think that all relationships revolve entirely around them.
when they set their mind to something, absolute-- there is no gray area.
it would also manifest in a way that would be visible to people around the unsub.
intense bouts of anger and depression, problems drinking.
he would also be highly sensitive to rejection.
and one last thing.
it is not easy to crack clean into breastbone.
you're dealing with a guy who works with his hands and he's used to hard labor.
at the very least, he's not afraid to get dirty.
now, I'm gonna take that out of your mouth and you're gonna be really quiet.
like a doll. Ok?
Oh, that's good.
let's go on upstairs.
and you're gonna be really, really nice to the boy.
not like the little bitch we all know you are.
you understand?
say it!
I understand.
lovely.
Haley? Ok, mac and cheese. - Got it - Here you go. Good boy. - Hello - Mac and cheese. - Ah, it's the best.
it's Morgan. - Thanks.
Yeah, what's up?
you know I wouldn't be calling you unless I was desperate.
still no Gideon?
no, not a word.
Reid's starting to worry about him.
we really need you out here, man.
Morgan, I've already put in for the transfer. It's a done deal.
no, you didn't. Not yet, anyway.
it's not in the system, Hotch, not yet.
come on. You know this case.
you could pitch in on just this one.
we think he might be using his own kid to lure these women, man.
he just picked up another one.
Hotch. - I got to think.
what are you doing?
multiplication. - Multiplication.
that's hard. - It's extra credit.
the rest of the class is still on long division.
maybe I could help you.
it's ok. - I'm really good at math.
the boy...
has got to learn to do things by himself.
no, of course.
but you can make me a sandwich.
OK. - Come on.
let's go clean up your room.
help!
what the hell are you doing?
keep your voice down.
Gideon didn't show in Milwaukee and the team needs me.
I don't believe this.
don't worry, it won't affect my transfer.
I've been working on an existing case.
you're not working on this case.
I can't just switch off my loyalty, Haley.
they suspended you for 2 weeks.
who are you being loyal to?
the team needs me.
no, they need Gideon.
do you know what this guy's doing to women in Milwaukee? I don't want to know.
he's using his son to lure them, he's holding them, and then he's cutting their hearts out.
aaron, stop!
don't make me the monster here.
I feel sick about these women, but when this case is over, there will be another one.
and another one and another one.
it is never going to stop.
this is who I am.
no...
this is what you do.
I'm trying to do the right thing, here and there, and I would really appreciate a little support.
that's right.
cause you always need to be the hero.
don't give me that. - No.
obviously a happy life isn't enough for you.
I'll be back...as soon as this case is over.
Yeah, well, make sure you give your son a kiss before you leave.
can I come in?
the team needs us. They're working on a case in Milwaukee.
Gideon hasn't shown up, and don't tell me you quit or I put in for a transfer.
you put in for a transfer?
they're both still hung up in the system, so technically we're in dereliction of duty by not being there.
I'm sorry, I can't go.
right. Sorry I barged in.
wait. Wait. Can I ask
why are you really here?
I told you.
I think Strauss came to you and asked for dirt on me.
why would she do that?
I think if you have your eyes on top leadership at the FBI, you want to know who might stand in your way.
and... what could I have told her?
that one of my agents might have murdered a suspect in cold blood.
or another might have a serious drug problem which I didn't report, and if Strauss had any evidence, my career would be over.
I think she put you on our team and expected something in return.
and to your credit, you quit.
rather than whisper in her ear.
I told you.
I hate politics.
come to Milwaukee.
I'll make you a deal.
if your ready bag isn't here, packed, I won't bug you anymore.
if it is, I want you on that plane with me. One more case.
I already turned in my badge and my gun.
that's just hardware.
I have triple patrol in the area and I've got every available unit Recanvassing.
it's tough knowing they're out there and we're still a step behind.
you know, it used to be a running joke that if you told people you were from Milwaukee, all they wanted to talk about was happy day reruns.
and then Dahmer happens and they ask you about it as if it's the same thing.
as if it's entertainment.
but I was in that apartment.
Gideon, one of our bosses, says that there are things that attach to you that...
you can never wash off.
all right, -- is it possible we're looking at this the wrong way?
what do you mean?
well, we're trying to zero in on the unsub.
now, you guys tell me, but...
if he really is using his son, wouldn't the trauma manifest more clearly on the boy?
can your analyst get a list of all the children in the area that we're targeting?
Garcia can get you whatever you want.
talk dirty to me.
I
this is section chief Erin Strauss.
ma'am, I think it goes without saying that I was expecting it to be someone else.
I need a list of every grade school in the third ward and Wauwatosa.
Yes, ma'am.
the third ward has one public grade school, but there appears to be 4 private schools that draw from that area.
and Wauwatosa?
that would be 9, ma'am.
and how many students? - 3200
can you also get me a list of every guidance counselor that deals directly with the student body in that area?
certainly, ma'am.
and again, I'd like to a...
you need to present these counselors with a profile of a troubled kid.
the boy we're looking for is possibly from a single-parent home.
he's sullen and withdrawn.
he may have been caught stealing things from his female teachers.
he's more than likely clinging to maternal figures in inappropriate settings
hugging the female bus driver, the woman in the lunchroom.
his classmates might notice this inappropriate behavior and tease him, which makes the boy incredibly angry.
that many. - I'm afraid so.
well, thank you.
how was school? - Ok.
it was just ok?
is the lady still at home? - Yeah.
is she gonna leave? - I don't know.
I don't want her to.
sometimes things happen. Grown-up things.
I don't want this one to go. - But they
they all leave. Ok?
maybe they all leave because of you. - What?
I know you're old enough to understand this.
I will not always be around!
they all leave. All of them.
they leave, they leave, they leave. Do you understand me?
it's all right.
it's ok, all right?
I'm just trying to teach you something.
all right, the boy doesn't look like he could be any older than 7.
let's work youngest to oldest.
start with the Worbe Sthavior.
get the names of the parents, send them over to Garcia.
she can cross-check for criminal records.
this guy's dumping bodies between 7: 30 and 8: 00. That gives us...
a little over 12 hours to make something hit.
let's get it done. - Look who's here.
Hey. Where do we start?
how fast can you get us up to speed?
how fast can you sit down?
we're only here to help.
we'll deal with this later.
it's impossible. There's too many.
keep looking, Reid. We still have an hour.
thank you, by the way, for giving Garcia that file to give to me.
I don't know what you're talking about. I didn't see Garcia before I left.
did you sleep well? - Yeah.
do you mind if I have some cereal?
I guess not.
he's gonna kill you, you know.
are you all right?
I st--I stepped on her hair.
if you need a second, take a second. This is what it is.
just don't let the public see you break down.
this is a different area from the other dump sites, isn't it?
reid: He's getting smart.
he knows where all of our manpower will be so he's changing locations.
how long before he changes when and where he abducts them?
he does that, we're back at zero.
no, no, no, no. We gotta keep him out of here.
morgan says you're worried about Gideon.
I keep on calling him, he doesn't call back.
he's probably at his cabin. That's where he goes when he...
needs to get away.
Reid, I need your head in this. - I know.
so what's around the dump site?
here's the old printing press of quad graphics, and the paving yard, and then the concrete factory where we found the body.
none of them visible from the highway.
you don't end up there by accident.
so we go back to the schools, we eliminate the third ward, and we target problem kids whose fathers have held blue-collar jobs over the last 10 years.
what if he's not a problem kid? - What?
forget it. It's off the textbook profile.
what is it, Reid?
sometimes when a parent is unstable, especially if the other one's out of the picture, you'll do anything to be the perfect child.
like help your father abducts women?
they're never late for school.
even with the abductions, the disposal of the bodies, it's always timed perfectly so the kid will be on time to school.
I don't think the killer would care. I think the kid would.
FBI. Technical analyst Penelope Garcia speaking.
Garcia, I need a list of parents from the Wauwatosa school district, eliminating any two-parent households or any fathers holding white collar jobs that aren't labor management.
you'll see it flying over the transom momentarily.
and one more thing-- the glitches in the transfers and resignations stop now.
uh-- yes, sir.
and, Garcia... - yes?
thank you.
he's a kid that's a model student.
not just straight as, though.
it's someone who tries to please in a way that the other teachers have probably talked about.
inventing extra-credit projects, volunteering to skip recess to help clean the classroom, stuff like that.
do you know his father?
Oh, it's such a sad story.
the teachers all talk about it.
he was diagnosed with an inoperable tumor 6 months ago, and his wife left the two of them.
she just left?
Yeah. I don't know what's gonna happen to David.
thank you for driving me.
you know, I can't just leave you here.
I have to make sure your dad's home.
I know.
I can't imagine David's father being someone you're looking for.
he's very involved.
he drops David off and picks him up every day.
do you happen to know what kind of car he drives?
a van, maybe?
I can't say. Something big.
he makes hand-crafted furniture.
I know he does deliveries.
miss Bennett. - Just continue working.
we're looking for David Smith.
you just missed him.
do you know where he went?
he wasn't feeling well, so the nurse volunteered to drive him home to help out David's father.
thank you.
the boy's alone in the family room.
where are your other agents?
covering the other side.
they have an eye-line just in case somebody tries to sneak out the back.
is there any sign of the nurse or the dad?
no.
go ahead, you want to scream, scream.
go ahead and scream!
the school knows that I'm here! - Yes, yes.
you dropped the boy off, I thanked you, and then you left.
they'll find your car in the parking lot of the Mayfair mall.
I was trying to help your son.
so what are we doing here?
we call in S. W.A. T.Secu trehe perimeter, and wait for him to come out.
ma'am, he's holding a woman inside.
we don't know that for certain.
we don't have probable cause.
she's right.
if he's got her, he waits 48 hours.
he's not gonna kill her yet.
he's changed the pattern of the dump sites, and now he's changed how he abducts them.
do we really want to gamble that he's sticking to the rest of the model?
so let's pound on the door.
maybe he'll panic.
but he could spook just enough to kill her early.
let me go in alone.
the boy's in the family room.
he'll answer the door. - No.
we need to get invited in that door.
he's looking for female authority figures.
if he lets me in, I can signal as soon as I see anything that gives us cause.
technically, you're not even in the FBI.
all the better.
she's interfering with a federal investigation.
well, if I'm no longer in the FBI, then you have no authority over me.
I'm just a civilian knocking on a little boy's door.
Prentiss. - Thank you - As soon as you have probable cause, give us a signal and get out of there. - Ok.
everybody knows what we need to make this arrest legal.
Hi.
are you David?
your dad asked me to come by.
he's busy.
would it be ok if i came in and waited?
I guess.
thank you.
my dad says it's unsafe to leave your door unlocked.
smart man.
Prentiss is in. We're waiting on her go.
so...
where is your dad?
he's working in there.
is he alone would it be ok if I just let him know I was waiting?
he doesn't like me to go down there when he's working.
Oh, no, you don't have to.
um, I just gonna go and see if he's too busy.
and we can both be really quiet, ok? Can you be quiet?
who is this?
where did she come from?
she said she knew you. - What?
she said she knew you.
I can't.
take it.
it's ok. Just...
no.
point it right here.
right thing
let's go!
drop the weapon, son.
give me the gun.
here.
that's ok.
do what they say.
are you ok?
you're dying, and this is what you want to leave your son?
how's your head?
I'll live.
is it weird I'm glad to be back?
I'll make sure it stays official.
I'll be dead before I ever stand trial. - Good.
you know, I never even told the boy to bring me this last one.
how's she doing?
she's gonna be ok.
you know, I can't officially approve of how this transpired, right? - No.
the arrest was clean.
it would be a mistake to break up this team.
none of you will ever move up the chain of command. You know that.
why would I ever want to leave the B. A.U.
you mean that? You're not gonna leave us?
I don't know. I gotta talk to Haley.
Spencer, I knew it would be you who came to the cabin to check on me.
I'm sorry the explanation couldn't be better.
and I'm sorry it doesn't make more sense.
but I've already told you, I just don't understand any of it anymore.
you get enough to eat, honey?
Oh, yeah.
you travelin'? - Yeah
where you headed?
nowhere in particular.
how will you know when you get there?
that's a good question...
a very good question.
have a great day. - You too.
I guess I'm just looking for it again.
for the belief I had back in college.
the belief I had when I first met Sarah and it all seemed so right.
Detroit, Michigan - You want it, baby. - I know you like it, daddy.
this stays quiet.
canada Border - 3 miles
u. S - Canadian Border Port Huron, Michigan
move forward, please. Thank you.
driver's license and government I. D.
what's the nature of your visit? - Pleasure.
you transporting any firearms? - No, sir.
fresh produce? Livestock? - Nope.
has anyone given you anything to bring across the border. - No, sir.
welcome to canada.
sir, you have to move your car.
sir, you have to go.
sir, you can't stop here. Go, keep moving!
stop the car now!
stop the car or we'll shoot!
get out of the car! - Get out of the vehicle!
put your hands out in front of you. - Let's see your hands!
palms toward me! - Get out of the car!
get out of the car! - Get out of the car!
keep your hands in the air!
keep 'em up!
move to the left. Keep your hands high where I can see them.
all right, stop. Stop. Put your hands on your head.
get down on your knees.
slowly put your hands down on the pavement and lie on your stomach.
don't move!
you're gonna want to call the FBI.
I've killed 10 people in the last month.
what are you talking about? - Look in the car.
get him up. Get him up. Get him on his feet.
are you telling me you killed all these people?
make the call.
his name's William Hightower.
he claims over the past month, he's picked 10 people off the streets of Detroit, killed them, dumped their bodies across the border in Canada.
has he given up the dumpsite?
he said he'll only talk to the FBI.
do we have confirmation these people are even missing?
two were reported missing by family months ago, but they all appear to be transients.
we're having a hard time finding any information on them.
Garcia? - Like a bloodhound, sir.
so what do we know about this guy?
until 2 months ago, he was a sergeant in the U. S.army.
he did 2 tours in Iraq. Lost his left leg in a roadside ambush.
he was discharged with a purple heart and a commendation for valor.
and the royal canadian mounted police are requesting our help?
they don't have a lot of choice.
he manages to get away with 10 murders, why crash the guard post?
could be an attempted suicide.
and maybe he was trying to take as many people with him as he could.
it may also be a case of post-traumatic stress disorder.
I don't know. - Do we think he's legit?
I think it's too many bodies to take chances.
flannery O'Connor said, "If there were no hell, we would be like the animals. No hell, no dignity.
he documented them all in detail.
names, photos, dates, and locations where he took them.
military background. He's bound to be organized.
he definitely doesn't have a type.
the only consistency is that they were all abducted in the same area.
Yeah, what do we know about that? - It's called the cass corridor. It's right here.
it has an extremely high concentration of drug trafficking, prostitution, and homeless people.
all high-risk behavior.
so, for this guy, maybe it's more about oprtunity than victimology.
morgan and Prentiss, when we land, I want you to head straight to detroit.
see if you hear anything in the whisper stream.
I want to make sure we have a crime before we get too deeply into this.
I hear detroit is beautiful in the sprg.
the rest of us will meet with the legal attache before whit the royal canadian mounted police.
actually, sir, the officer in charge said that his team was part of a fellowship the B.A.U. gave to train police forces in profiling.
that was the first one we ever did.
you know him? - Yeah.
is he any good? - He better be. I trained him.
Dave. - Jeff, how you been?
you mean besides having serial killers trying to take out our border agents?
je bedwell, agents Aaron Hotchner, Spencer Reid, Jennifer Jareau.
thanks for being here.
I've got a victim board and timelines set up on monitors in the conference room.
anything you need, you've got the run of the place.
we appreciate it. - Don't thank me. Thank the unsub.
he's the one that put you all in charge.
I see you paid attention in class.
I need to go talk to Garcia, see if she had any luck locating the family members.
and check records for multiple border crosses, - see if we get any hits for the days the victims went missing. - Got it.
you believe that he killed all these people?
fits the profile. - How so?
he got a recent physical trauma. Could be a stressor. Wide disparity of victims.
no bodies. Possible border cross. Two entirely different terrains.
to pull that off, you'd have to be smart, you'd have to be organized, mobile, physical.
military background gives you all that. - Exactly.
it appears as though he clusters his victims into men, then women, and then back to men again.
what does that tell you?
at the moment, nothing.
has he contacted family?
refuses a lawyer, too.
he's in interrogation? - Waiting for us.
this guy's U. S.army. He demanded to talk to the FBI.
he's not gonna want to talk to anyone but the person he thinks is in charge.
of course. I'll take you to him.
has he been agitated?
hasn't flinched.
he knows we're here?
we told him. - Good.
you're not gonna interrogate him?
if I go in now, he's in charge.
if I wait and gather information... It's minterview.
so you let him sweat.
let's see what we turn up in Detroit.
I don't think the bailout's gonna cover all of this.
anything seem strange to you? - Yeah, they've set up camps.
I don't see a single person who's isolated themselves from thethers.
people on the street don't usually care about safety in numbers.
unless something scared them into changing their behavior.
look at this. Drug deals are out in the open.
prostitutes seem to be working inroups. I mean, if this guy did kill 10 people,
I don't see how he could have done it without witnesses.
so, how do you want to work this?
I think we start with the most recent victim first, see if we even have a crime here.
why don't you start with the junkies and I'll take the working girls.
keep dreaming.
ladies, you seen these two guys? Anybody look like that?
what's up, my man? You seen a brother look like that?
no?
my man, you mind if I ask you a few questions?
depends what you're asking.
you know him? - That's Charles.
don't know his last name.
you ever see him get into any kind of beef with anyone?
Charles was a junkie.
junkies want peace.
you just said he was a junkie. U know something I don't?
just that he's gone. 2 days now.
is that weird, for him to disappear for 2 days like that?
a lot of people have been disappearing these days.
and when they do, they don't come back.
that's gotta happen out here all the time, no?
not like this, man.
one day a girl's on the street, the next she's gone.
we've been trying to stick together, but once a john rolls up, you're on your own.
what makes you think these people aren't just leaving?
it's not that easy to get away from this life. Trust me.
do you recognize this man?
he's out here all the time.
has anyone ever tried to hassle with him?
brother's got a gun. No one messes with him.
but he messes with all of you, right?
not exactly.
I need to know everything this brother does.
how he talks, how he moves.
every bit of his behavior. Can you do that for me?
Yeah, ok. Got it.
Morgan? - We're ready.
I'm Aaron Hotchner. I'm the behavioral analysis unit chief from the FBI.
you're here to analyze me.
no, I'm here to take your confession and find out where you dumped your victims.
or are you wasting my time?
I gave you names. I gave you dates.
you didn't give me a dump site.
you were a sergeant. You led troops, probably lost men.
a few.
how would their parents feel if the didn't know whether their sons were dead or alive?
don't lecture me on notifying families.
I've been on those doorsteps.
no one cares about those people. Why should I?
here we go.
what do you mean? - An interrogation doesn't really start until you get the first lie.
see, that's just the thing, William. We talked to the people on the street.
you were out there every night. You took their photographs.
you checked off their names in a notebook.
so?
your behavior was more like a protector, like someone in the army doing a bed check.
you've gone to a lot of trouble to confess to a crime you didn't commit.
the folks on the street-- did they tell you people were missing?
if my team is here, then there are cases we are not working on.
you are wasting our time. - 10 people dead, huh?
it's not enough for you.
I've watched the tape of you at the border cross over and over again.
you wait until every guard is out of the booth before you drive into it.
if you wanted to kill people, you had your chance.
are you investigating these murders or not?
so that's what this is all about?
making sure we investigate?
if you thought people were being killed, you should have gone to the police in Detroit.
I did.
3 times.
they told me the kind of people I was looking for disappeared.
they said that's the way life on the street works.
do you believe the people I showed you are missing?
I believe it's possible.
don't give me a political answer.
tell me what happened the night before the border cross.
I did a head count.
every night for the last month like we do in Baghdad.
that night I saw a boy named Charles wasn't where he usually camped down, so I made another pass.
he didn't turn up?
by the morning, I knew he was gone.
William... People don't do what you did out of honor.
they do it out of love.
who were you looking for on the streets every night?
I got home from Iraq.
first thing my mother told me was that my baby sister Lee was on the streets.
she asked me to find her.
but you couldn't?
I managed once. Brought her home.
we got her fed.
she even wore my dog tags... For good luck.
two weeks later, she slipped back onto the streets.
that was it.
William, you've got so much information about the other potential victims. Why not Lee?
I hid in a spare tire...
in my car.
I needed to wait until I was sure...
that you were on board.
William, are you there?
something bad is happening. It's dark.
I don't know where he's taking me.
after that, the signal cuts out.
this is the same night she left her mom's house?
Hightower called in an army favor.
they triangulated the call to a cell tower in canada just over the border in port Huron.
it explains why he crossed into your jurisdiction.
it's also a surefire way to get the FBI involved.
he knew we'd investigate an American citizen being held on multiple murder charges.
and you believe him? - I do.
go ahead, Garcia. - Good news and bad news.
I've got I. D. s on multiple border crosses for the dates in question.
trouble is, I've got hundreds, and as far as I can tell, if your license doesn't ping for any prior felonies, you're pretty much gonna pass go and collect 200 canadian dollars.
she's right. Busiest cross in North America.
lot of commercial traffic, trucks mostly.
stop and searches would cause too many delays.
so he's got virtually free passage.
and once he crosses, there's nothing but woods to hide whatever he's doing.
canada, Ontario
I don't understand why we need to talk in private.
we want you to release William Hightower into our custody.
I can't do that.
he's documented a potential victim pool in Detroit.
he's our best eyes on the street.
he tried to murder 5 border agents.
you can't personalize this, Jeff.
isn't that what you're doing to me, trading on our relationship to get me to release a prisoner?
I respect what you've taught me, but when you leave,
I still have to be able to look my men in the eye.
then do whatever you can to catch the unsub.
it's not that simple.
you getting pressure from above?
they're not gonna let me turn William Hightower into a hero.
this unsub kills in 2- and 3-day cycles.
which means he's about to go back out there, hunting.
release him into FBI custody while he's in Detroit.
when the case is closed, he'll be back under your jurisdiction.
your shop, your call.
well... They can fire me if they want.
Hey, uh, they say you get used to it.
right now, it just hurts like hell.
we'd like you with us in the cass corridor.
doing what? - The same thing you've been doing.
we'll conduct nightly checks. You have a rapport out there.
if something is happening, we'll react more quickly and we'll have more manpower.
is the Detroit police department on board?
we're talking to them now about it.
william Hightower. Yeah, I remember him.
he was sincere. I felt for him.
but you didn't look into it.
families don't want to see what we do.
they'd rather believe someone is dead than admit she's off turning tricks in Chicago or Toronto.
we believe William Hightower might be right.
you might have a serial killer.
we'd like you to open up your records.
let our analysts take a look at reports from the past few months and see if there's been a change in the crime patter disturbances or assaults that may be connected.
I can do that.
we'd also like to give your colleagues the working profile once we have it to see if anything sparks.
fair enough. So, how did he convince the FBI to look into this?
he drove his car into the guard post at the port Huron border and then confessed to murdering 10 people.
Seriously? - Yes.
how many victims did he say?
potentially 11, including his sister.
Yes, ma'am, right now we just consider them missing.
the second I get more information, I'll be in contact with you. Ok.
how's it going?
the majority of the people on the street aren't even from Detroit.
we don't have last names on most of them. No hometowns.
unless there's a missing persons report on file somewhere, it's almost impossible.
most of these people's families probably gave up on seeing them long ago.
a mother would never give up.
can you hand me William Hightower's arrest report?
Yeah, Garcia. - Sherlock, it's Watson.
I think I've got something. - What do you have?
I checked Detroit crime reports over the last month because Derek and Emily astutely thought there might be some sorts of assaults or disturbances - having to do with our unsub. - And?
well, it's tres weird, but on 5 of the abduction nights, Detroit p. d.reports a break-in or a robbery at some type of medical facility.
what types of medical facility?
we got a hospital, blood bank, medical supply company, the red cross
what is he doing, stealing narcotics?
that's just it. He isn't some drugstore cowboy.
the stuff he took is, like, anesthesia and sterilizing equipment and syringes.
negative on the narcota.
Garcia, where were these places located?
Putnam street, st. Antoine, east hancock, Martin Luther King Boulevard.
those are all in the cass corridor.
do you have a list of what else he stole?
uh, i.v. tubing, infusion pump, units of o-negative blood, chest tubes, o-silk sutures, elastoplast.
Garcia, thanks a lot.
you don't just randomly know how toook a line up to an infusion pump.
or that o-neg is the only safe blood type for any victim.
I'll tell Hotch we think we know what he's doing with them.
we believe the man we're looking for is a sexual sadist.
what this means is that for him, the torture becomes a substitute for the sex act.
the fact that he's stealing medical equipment like sterilizing agents and anesthesia tells us he may be performing experiments or surgeries on his victims.
we believe this unsub gets gratification from his ability to keep his victims alive in order to endure more torture.
the choice of items stolen is extremely specific, which makes us believe he's got a medical background.
check disciplinary files at hospitals, med schools, and community health organizations.
people would have noticed his behavior.
this is someone who would volunteer to perform painful procedures.
and he would spend extra time probing, say, a broken hand or a distended abdomen.
and after a long day, when everyone else is emotionally drained from multiple traumas and mangled bodies, he'd be the one pushing his coworkers to go out for a drink and talk about their day.
now, we know what you're thinking
a profile is fine, but, yes, our best shot at stopping this guy is still to catch him in the act.
this unsub is extremely smart and obviously organized.
he's managed to abduct very different victims with very different abilities, all with no witnesses.
now, we're coordinating with the police and our agents on the ground in Detroit.
we've also asked sergeant Hightower to act as a guide on the streets in Detroit - while he's in our custody. - That's it.
any questions, you find me or one of the agents.
what's she doing here?
well, we've notified all the family members we can locate.
you have no right.
it's her daughter. - No, it's one thing to...
to believe Lee is lost on the streets.
I don't want her to know that there's a killer out there.
we know how this is gonna end. - No, we don't.
look, everything I have done is to find the truth so I can spare her.
I don't want her living off hope.
there are worse things. - You're wrong.
bad news stops us for a while, but then you move on.
hope is paralyzing.
you did a stupid thing.
Yes, ma'am. - Come here.
all these people are missing?
we believe so. - You have any suspects?
no. But we have a strategy to try to catch him.
and William is helping.
my daughter-- there's a chance she-- she might still be alive?
it's possible.
do you know what he's doing to them?
it's difficult to say.
detroit Police Department 13Th Precinct
thanks for believing me.
William, I want you to understand that even if we catch him,
you're probably gonna end up doing some time in Canada.
I can live with that.
detective Tay Benning, this is ssa Aaron Hotchner. - How do you do?
this is William Hightower. He's gonna help us on the ground.
these are agents Prentiss and Morgan, detective Benning.
we've met.
I'm sorry I didn't look into your sister's disappearance.
we should split up and cover male and female potential victims.
OK. - We'll take the men.
I'll make the introductions for you.
stay close to your phones. If anyone's out of place,
detective Benning can get a name and a description to our patrol cars as quickly as possible.
you really believe he's about to abduct someone again?
it's coming soon-- tonight, tomorrow.
we know he sticks to a tight cycle.
the question is, why alternate victims in clusters of men and women?
why take the men at all?
what do you mean?
we said he sees these people as disposable.
it doesn't matter if they're male or female.
for a sexual sadist, male or female isn't important.
the torture itself is the sex.
but wouldn't it be much easier to approach a prostitute?
she's right. A prostitute will get into a car with an unsub.
it's a victim he can isolate easily with no witnesses.
is Hightower's mother still here?
she's resting in my office.
JJ, see if she's willing to talk to us.
I want to know everything I can about her daughter.
in the meantime, we need to figure out how he's separating his male victims from the pack.
and hope that Hightower gives us an edge on the street.
this group gonna stay close to cass avenue.
they're usually on the corners. They don't stray.
it's like I said the first time I was out here
it is not easy for someone to be isolated.
everything is out in the open.
OK. That's Walter Patterson.
he helped show me the lay of theand.
yo, Walter!
this is detective Benning and agent Morgan. They need your smarts.
you know he lost his baby sister, right?
Yes, we do.
spread the wd.
they're not here to hassle anyone.
be safe.
so... What do you want to know?
what would make you separate from everyone else out here?
there's nothin'.
there's gotta be something. You go to the bathroom? Grab some food?
drugs? Women?
everybody's extra careful right now.
people gotta have secrets, even on the street, Walter.
the only thing I keep secret out here is money.
Hey, we have 3 unaccounted for.
these are their photos?
did you see any of these girls leave with customers?
I saw Monica and Sasha. I don't know about Kelly.
do you know where they would go?
there's a parking lot down at cass park.
the girls have their johns park there.
detective Benning, can you call any units at cass park. I'll hold on the line.
what about Kelly? Is there a reason why you wouldn't have seen her leave?
I don't know. I could have been distracted.
so she was here before. - Yeah.
was there any reason she would sneak off?
I don't know what she does. She's fresh meat out here.
OK. Detroit p. d.confirmed two prostitutes with johns in the parking lot at cass park.
so we're short one girl.
you knew William's sister Lee?
you gonna hook me up?
tell them if you knew my sister.
Yeah, I knew her.
is there anyplace that she would have taken clients?
maybe somewhere the other girls wouldn't go.
she didn't do it regular.
she'd try to get a real job, but then she'd slip.
then about a month and a half ago she said she was leaving.
that's when I took her to my mom's.
I ain't seen her since.
lee disappeared, I begged William to find her, but it wasn't fair to him.
I'm sure he wanted to find her as much as you did.
he'd just gotten home. He lost his leg, and he was going to physical therapy.
he hadn't even processed what happened to him yet.
but he found her. - First time.
she came home for 2 weeks and I had her going to meetings.
I even got her onto welfare.
so what happened?
the day after the first check came, she disappeared.
wait, what was that date? - The 2nd?
what if that's it? - What?
lee Hightower was abducted on the 2nd, the day after she cashed a welfare check.
so? - Look at the dates of the other abductions.
all the men are abducted around the first and the 15th of the month.
when welfare checks are issued.
what if he's not intentionally clustering th male/female?
what if this is how he best isolates his victims?
you think he has a way to get them alone based on how they cash their checks?
and then the rest of the month he resorts to picking up prostitutes.
it would explain the pattern.
we need to find out where these men cash their checks.
we don't have last names. There's no way to find them.
Morgan, figure out how people on the streets are cashing their welfare checks.
Garcia. - Sir.
I need you to find out if Lee Hightower ever cashed a welfare check.
OK. I'm typing my fastest.
listen, when someone out here's on welfare, where do they go when they get their check?
it depends what they want. - What do you mean?
those checks have strings.
you gotta either spend it on food or lodging.
OK.
a lot of people out here don't want food or lodging.
this is one of those money secrets you were talking about?
there's a motel on third.
uh, greyburn lodge, 43608 third street.
lee Hightower cashed her check there on the 2nd.
they'll cash your check for 30 cents on the dollar providing you don't take the room.
so you walk away with drug money, but you're still on the street.
dope fiends keep it quiet.
they don't want anyone knowing they're holding that much cash.
it explains why they're alone.
and they'd be looking to score.
if they thought somebody was a dealer, they'd walk right up to them.
Walter, thank you. - Thank you.
don't spend it all in one place, sweetie.
what's going on? - Police.
FBI. Have you seen any of these men?
maybe. - Not maybe. Yes or no.
they need the cash and I need the business, and nobody gets hurt, folks.
the others were here, too. - You seen this girl?
Yeah, she was here maybe 15 minutes ago.
did anybody approach her when she left?
there was a dealer across the street. He just sits there and then they signal.
do you know his name?
no, I never seen his face. Just the car. They all use him.
that's it.
car's a dark-colored american sedan.
I want full searches of anything that even remotely matches the description.
THKS for putting your ass on the line over Hightower.
thanks for being right.
anything? - No, sir.
No! No!
they should have tried to make the cross at least an hour ago.
any word from the off-road sites?
I have agents at every known drug smuggling entry. Nothing.
this unsub's smart. Everything about his plan is well researched.
I think his border crossings would be consistent.
are there former shipping lanes somebody could have studied in advance?
nothing marked.
hunters might know the terrain, but it's word of mouth. Nothing documented.
what about the underground railroad? - How so?
in the civil war, Detroit was the last stop for a slave before they escaped to freedom in Canada.
they made the crossing in this area.
he's right. But there aren't any historical landmarks that register the crossing points.
well, if I remember right, they built a series of victorian homes along the river to signify safe passage.
some of those homes might still exist.
we know your sister's cell phone registered at a tower near port Huron.
he had to be close by when he crossed the border.
Garcia. - Present.
is it possible to cross-reference civil war maps with victorian homes that still exist in the port Huron area?
well, I'm gonna take that question as rhetorical and...
got one. 3 miles south of the blue water bridge.
can you send me a gps map? - Coming now.
Thanks. Prentiss, you and William come with me. The rest of you stay here.
we might need to be mobile in a hurry.
Garcia's sure this is the spot?
the house is inland. Access from the water would be here.
there's nothing here.
let's split up. The river's over here.
over here!
looks like he might have stashed cars on either side of the river.
the license plate is missing.
Garcia, I need you to run a vin number.
you got that?
vehicle belongs to one Mason Turner.
what do you know about him?
age 39, went to undergrad in toronto, graduated second in his class from michigan medical institute 2000, went on to work for a public health organization in detroit.
we got him. Do you have an address?
Yes. Looks like a farm.
please... Don't do this.
I won't tell anybody. Just let me go.
I don't even know where we are.
please don't do this. Please!
who is that?
you 4 take the exterior. We'll take the house.
fought on other people's turf before.
you don't walk into this situation unarmed.
I can't give you a gun, William.
I got 10 years active duty.
the man we find might have killed your sister.
I need answers. If I shoot him, I get nothing.
I'm sorry. Stay close. What we find might not be easy.
I just need to know.
Prentiss. Check this out.
we're in the right place.
sir, are you all right? - What the hell are you?
did someone do this to you?
get the hell out of my house.
you're Mason Turner?
that's not your business.
he's our unsub?
stop! No!
No! No!
who the hell are you people?
you are Mason Turner?
Dr. Turner.
this is my sister, Lee Hightower. Has she been here?
can someone please tell me what the hell is going on.
we're with the FBI.
we've been invited by the rcmp to assist in an ongoing investigation.
you haven't been invited into my home.
my Canadian home.
now get the hell out before I call the proper authorities.
sir, we've been invited by the proper authorities. - Telephone, dial number 911.
911. What's your emergency?
this is Dr. Mason Turner, 11712 scott road.
that won't be necessary.
I want these people out of my home. They don't have any right to be here.
agent Rossi, agent Hotchner, may I have a word with you, please?
help me!
help me!
did you hear that?
what?
was that a scream?
anything?
I don't even know what direction in came from.
that's another reason I hate these damn woods.
it messes with the sound.
you said this would be the unsub.
everything points to him, inspector.
the profile was right.
does that man look capable of abducting anyone?
relax, Jeff.
I let a suspect who tried to kill my border agents out of jail, a man who actually confessed to the crimes we're investigating, because I believed you.
and you were wrong.
it doesn't always make sense initially. - No.
I'm taking my prisoner back to the station, and you can all go home. Excuse me.
pretty.
what's this thing?
I don't know as much about pig farms as you might think.
Prentiss. That's a handprint. That looks like blood.
Oh, my god.
Hotch! The box next to the pigs-- it's like a garbage bin or something.
it's full of nothing but bloody shoes, all different sizes, male and female.
we said we were looking for 10 missings?
there's gotta be over 100 pairs of shoes in that thing.
these are... They belong to victims?
possibly.
why just the shoes? Where are the bodies?
I don't think there's going to be any bodies, guys.
pigs are omnivores. They'll eat anything.
by anything, I mean... Anything.
what happened? - I'm going to take these cuffs of you.
what's going on?
we're still not sure, William.
did you find my sister? - No.
but...
would you happen to know what kind of shoes she was wearing when she went missing?
she was...
is Bedwell alright? - He will be. He has every available cop in Ontario on the way here.
you find anyone in the house?
is he in custody?
uh, not exactly. - But he's not going anywhere.
he's quadriplegic.
paralyzed from the neck down. JJ's in there with him right now.
well, that's a pretty good criminal defense.
I'll go talk to him.
Morgan, do you have the contact number for the Detroit detective? - Benning? Yeah.
Yeah, we're gonna need their open missings so we can make identifications on this property.
right.
I think that laptop is his sole communications device.
which means data files on hard drives, records.
B. A.U. tech center, where you should definitely pay attention to the girl behind the curtain.
Garcia, I need you in Ontario a. s.a. p.at the farmhouse that the unsub's car was registered to.
Yes, sir. What should I bring?
we need forensic recovery from a laptop.
I'll tell you more when you get here. I don't want this over the phone.
and the next flight, Garcia. - Ok. On my way.
Oh, my. Not over the phone.
I don't think we're gonna be in Kansas anymore.
Reid, will you let Bedwell know that we're gonna need a warrant to examine the laptop and the hard drives. Reid.
how long do you think it would take? - To get a warrant?
no. For the pigs to...
depending on the size and condition of the body when it's placed in the pen, it wouldn't be quick. Why?
that means Kelly wasn't put in there.
she's still here somewhere.
my parents are gonna be looking for me.
they're important people.
do you hear me?
you better let me go.
I'm serious!
you're gonna be in big trouble in you don't.
are you listening to me? I'm sorry! Oh, I'm sorry.
I think they're gonna need some help outside.
Yes, sir.
did something happen out there?
you know what we found.
how could I? You see I'm paralyzed.
don't touch that.
you know exactly what's out there.
you watched the whole thing.
put that back.
you like watching, don't you?
this is not your jurisdiction.
Oh, I'm not gonna arre you.
stop that!
phone. Dial number-- no.
you can't do this to me.
I'm not doing anything to you.
in fact, you don't even have to talk to me.
as you said, I have no jurisdiction here. But...
almost every policeman in Ontario is on their way to this farm, and they do have jurisdiction.
some very bad things have happened here, and they're gonna discover all of them.
now, Mason...
how many victims were there?
100? More?
do you even know for sure?
I need my mirrors. - No.
what you need is something to make you look less like the monster that we both know that you really are.
how can you call me that?
I've never laid a hand on anybody.
you need to tell me where the other guy is before he kills Kelly, your latest victim.
so, how much time does she have, Mason?
how much time do you have before I'm unable to say that you helped me?
no, no, no, no. - I think I have a concussion.
I need a hospital. - No hospitals!
I won't tell them about you. Just drop me off.
hospitals are bad places!
I really need to see a doctor.
Mason says no hospitals! Never no hospitals!
OK. Ok, no hospital.
it was my brother... Lucas.
he's crazy. He did all of it.
he did this to me, too.
I wanted to try to stop him. How could I?
why didn't you call for help?
I tried that once, but he found out.
he beat me. He almost killed me.
you don't understand what it's like to be completely vulnerable to someone who's capable of the things that he's done.
where is he right now?
Oh, I wish I could help you.
I don't know what he does when he leaves me here.
he has a girl with him.
a young girl from Detroit.
then you... Should pray for her.
there's a picture of him in the other room.
it was taken years ago, but it still looks like him.
I should warn you...
he's crazy and very big.
inhumanely strong.
when you find him, you should warn everyone...
if they n't kill him first, he'll kill all of you.
good. Yep.
judge will sign the warrant for the laptop first thing in the morning.
our tech should just be getting there then.
we got search-and-rescue units coming.
they're also our emergency response team, so they'll be armed in case we come across something.
when this hits the press, families of missings are gonna come rushing out here.
I'm gonna need some uniformed officers to assist me.
come on, let's get you set up.
Morgan, I want you to supervise the evidence collection.
I don't think the techs have seen a scene like this before.
has anyone? - We have a picture.
this is Lucas Turner, Mason's brother.
according to Mason, he's the unsub.
Mason claims he's a victim himself.
does Mason know where Lucas would take the girl?
claims he has no idea.
Reid, Lucas is your assignment.
find his room, his things, anything that might tell us where he would go.
on it. - One more thing.
Mason warned me that his brother is extremely psychotic.
says he won't go down without a fight.
Prentiss, have JJ get the picture and the description out to the press.
when they get here, put them to work for us.
somebody's gonna notice a man that big. - You got it.
according to Mason, Mason claims to. It sounds like you don't believe him.
he also said we shouldn't even try to talk to his brother.
we should shoot first.
well, that's either helpful advice...
or a way for half a team to clean up loose ends.
either way, this is some family.
if you have photos, I can take them here.
we have police officers that can answer questions about your loved ones.
Andre, these are the unsub's coveralls.
it looks like they haven't been washed in some metime, - so it should be a good scent source. - Got it.
your warrant.
you can search all his files and hard drives. - Great.
let's go serve it.
Garcia find me something. - Yes, sir.
agent Morgan.
you got here fast. - Detroit's not that far.
did you bring the case files?
I got 35 open missings. - That's all?
that's not enough?
89 pairs. - 89?
so far.
God.
I don't think god's been out here in a long time.
how is he? - How would you be?
he asked for help and nobody ever looked for his sister.
we did the best we could.
ignoring him was the best you could do?
we were undermanned.
well, these are just all throwaway people to you anyway, right?
that is not fair. - Isn't it?
agent morgan! Can you come here, please?
grab your case files.
Mason says his brother sometimes sleeps on the couch in the living room or disappears for days at a time.
he doesn't have a room? - Not according to Mason.
keep looking around. They've lived here their whole lives.
there's got to be something here that gives us an idea of who he is.
that is my personal property. - Not anymore.
I showed you the warrant. - I have research on there. Proprietary research.
intellectual property. I helped you.
I told you everything I know.
if what you've told me is your total involvement, there shouldn't be anything on this computer that you don't want us tsee.
do you need anything, Dave?
no. Me and Mason are having a great time. Aren't we, Mason?
once I saw my brother strangle a man so forcefully, blood dripped from his eye sockets.
I'm not talking petechia.
actual dripping blood.
he can be very volatile...
when things don't go his way.
are you trying to scare me?
I'm just saying.
you better hurry up and find that girl, or...
he's gonna tear her to pieces.
is someone supposed to call you on that phone?
you don't have to hide it. I'm trying to help.
maybe you don't get service in here.
are we underground? - What?
the walls look like we're underground.
if we are, your phone probably won't work in here.
won't work? - Not if we're underground.
have you found something?
she asked me for them.
before I went back over there, before I lost my...
William, I'm really sorry.
she didn't want me to go back.
it was like she knew something was gonna happen.
I should have listened to her.
Hotch. I gotta get out of here.
where?
I'm gonna hook up with Prentiss on the search party.
I--I can't stand around here.
OK. Keepn touch.
if you're waiting for someone to call you, they can't.
he always calls.
I'm telling you, he can't. - He always calls!
but if there's no service, he can't.
up here. Hey, I found out where he sleeps.
so Mason was lying?
I find it hard to believe he didn't know his brother was living in the barn.
anything up there that's gonna help us find him?
no, nothing yet. I will say this, though
I doubt that he's psychotic. - Why is that?
there's a collection of drawings up here that suggest autism or moderate mental retardation.
now, retardation and psychosis in the exact same subject is exceedingly rare.
it's more likely he doesn't fully understand the acts that he's committed.
anything to suggest a violent nature?
nothing in the drawings. They do suggest someone's been watching him.
he's very childlike.
I think that when we find him, he's gonna be scared and probably confused.
you think he'll fight?
uh, yeah, I don't know, maybe.
Hey, Hotch.
do you ever get the feeling that a case isn't going to end well?
Reid, keep looking. This girl needs us.
maybe you should go outside.
what? - And walk around out there until you get your call.
no.
you really should go. - He'll call me!
don't you say he won't call me!
don't you say he won't call me! - Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Please!
help me.
mommy?
I want to go. I want to go home. Mommy!
you've been with this team what, 2 years, right?
almost 3 already. - It's 7 for me.
I mean, that's all I've been thinking about all day...
is the entire time I've been with the B. A.U.working almost nonstop,
having no real life, these brothers have been out here killing 89 people and we didn't even know about it.
well, we know now. And we'll make them pay.
but how many others are still out there, Prentiss, hmm, hunting and killing?
I mean, the thing is, no matter what we do, no matter how hard we work,
no matter how good we are at what we do, this is never gonna end.
got some markings up ahead there.
the tree line.
he must have gone in the water.
if the dogs lose that scent, it's gonna be nothing but a needle in a big old haystack.
maybe we should split up, take either side of the stream.
he might have come back out somewhere up there.
as long as I don't have to hang out at that damn pig farm, I'm good.
OK, defense system, let's see what you're made of.
Bang--like berlin-- another wall falls, the world opens up.
there you are, inner core.
change password-- let's go with oz.
Oh, I'm feeling so dorothy gale today.
auntie em would be so proud...
No! - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
what?
mas... Mason says I always get mad too hard.
what's your name? My name is Kelly.
Mason says never, nev-never no names.
doesn't Mason want us to be friends?
friends?
they were doing experiments. - Experiments?
unsuccessful ones.
he tried to fix himself.
would it be better if it was all for nothing?
they were human beings.
they were transients and drug users and prostitutes.
they were useless to society.
I gave them the chance to be part of a cure.
to be of use.
but that's-- - that's science.
no, it isn't.
so you got some information off my laptop. So what?
what jury's gonna believe I had the power to kill anyone?
I haven't been able to move from the neck down for 7 years.
even if you could convict me of something...
what punishment could be worse than the life I already lead?
find my idiot brother.
exact your pound of flesh and leave me the hell alone.
no.
it's ok. You can tell me your name.
that's a nice name.
a very nice name.
do you have any food, Lucas?
food?
I'm hungry. I threw up all my food when I was sick.
I really need some food.
OK. - Oh, no. Wait.
I thought we were friends.
you don't have to tie me up, Lucas.
M-Mason says always.
Mason doesn't want us to be friends, remember?
you don't have to tie me up, Lucas. That's how friends act.
I really need some food.
OK.
they were doing experiments.
spinal regeneration? - Probably.
he was definitely trying to fix himself.
stem cell harvesting? The equipment's far too unsophisticated.
there's no way it would have ever worked.
you were a prosecutor, Hotch. Could you convict this guy?
a quadriplegic who clearly never touched any of the victims?
I don't know. We need to concentrate on Kelly.
we can't worry about the other stuff right now.
he might get away with this.
Prentiss, I got someone sneaking around about 30 yards ahead of me.
copy that.
FBI! Do not move!
berries.
what the hell was wrong with you?
I'm sorry, Mr. Lang. - Can I go?
uh, not yet, sir.
have you seen... This man?
that's Lucas Turner. - You know him.
Oh, everybody knows Lucas. He's--he's a little soft in the head.
you guys wait around long enough, he'll wander back home.
can I go? - Yes, sir. Thank you.
what do you think's in that bag?
I'm pretty sure I don't want to know.
these are delicious, Lucas.
could I have some water?
I have water. - Could I have some?
this is a nice house you have, Lucas.
Th--uh... This is not a house.
the--the farm is our house.
what is this, then?
it's for where we do hunting.
Me--me and my dad and my brother built it.
but then he died.
your brother died? - What?
you said-- - Mason didn't die.
he fell from the barn, but he didn't die.
it's ok. I'm sorry, Lucas.
I take--I take care of him.
it's all right. I just made a mistake.
I didn't--I didn't-- I didn't push him.
I didn't push mason off the barn.
how did you get hurt?
what difference does it make?
none, I guess.
my brother pushed me out of the loft.
I wanted to sell the farm.
I had just finished medical school.
it would have given me a nice down payment on a practice in the city.
but the farm was all he knew.
Lucas doesn't handle angry well.
is that why you hate him?
hate him? He's done nothing but take care of me every day since then.
you said not to even try talking to him, if we find him.
that sounds like you want us to kill him.
but... That's not hate.
that's a favor.
