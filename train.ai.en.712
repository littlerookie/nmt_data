wauthier said he'd been driven to desperation by the chairman's overbearing style--a relationship so toxic, that suicide seemed a logical escape.
wauthier was deeply enmeshed in zurich's top ranks, having spent 17 years at the company--nearly 16 years longer than ackermann.
wauthier was described by his friends and colleagues as easygoing, rational, and calm in his normal state, "says gerald kraines, clinical instructor in psychiatry at harvard medical school."
wauthier, far more familiar with the peculiarities of insurance accounting, argued that the company was in fact on track to meet its goals.
