what do you mean?
could we have the "circle of life" lesson later?
I need to get in here.
sorry.
her eyes are glassy.
you, get in here and ventilate.
we're losing her.
this is absolutely childish and ridiculous.
no, it's not.
it's not childish to hold on to hope.
it's actually hard-- very, very hard.
your son just wants to believe that some things can work out for the best.
get me the paddles.
come on, come on, come on.
what's she doing?
insuring we never see the inside of an O. R. This year?
she's in v-fib. I'm gonna shock.
charge to 300 and stand back.
okay, clear.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god. She's alive?
it worked. She's okay. Everything's gonna be okay.
Oh, my god.
got a big bleeder.
Dr. Grey, press and hold right here.
she's having contractions.
well, take a look, George.
probably the stress.
no, these are strong, and they're two minutes apart.
call O. B. And get someone in here.
uh, I don't think there's time to call O. B.
her water just broke, and she's crowning.
call peds. Get a warmer in here.
this baby's coming now.
O'malley, get her up in stirrups.
can we put her in a reverse trendelenburg, have one of the nurses press her abdomen since she can't push?
try it without all the jostling.
I'm holding on to a major artery here.
okay, clamp.
scissors.
I got it.
I got him.
great job, George.
Thanks.
Yeah, yeah, we're all heroes.
now if no one minds, I'd like to get this woman's arm sewn on.
like she said, she's gonna need it.
I'm starting the fusion now.
did he just move?
Oh, he d-- he definitely moved.
the anesthesia's light.
yang, stabilize his neck. - okay, three, come and grab his feet.
go under the drape and do not contaminate the sterile field.
we need to keep him very still until he is under.
we can't risk even the slightest movement.
you cannot move.
do you hear me?
this is not an option.
everything is not gonna be fine if you move.
it will be the opposite of fine.
you cannot leave the people you love. They need you.
not just the memory that you love them.
anyone care to explain to me how my patient wound up in this O. R.
and I wasn't even informed?
Dr. Karev didn't page you because he knows how to prioritize.
ten minutes ago, this patient was coding from a perfed abdomen.
under the circumstances, dr. Karev's quick thinking is the reason that your patient is even still alive.
I'll expect a fully dictated chart before you leave tonight, Karev.
Ah, jackpot.
did he swallow those?
poor fool. He must suffer from pica, an uncontrollable urge to eat any and everything.
check it out-- a buffalo nickel.
Dr. Bailey, I saw you were scrubbed in.
I thought I'd stop by and see what you've got.
what I've got?
$2. 37, sir. In change.
it like a cute festival in here.
I delivered that one an hour ago.
Oh, my god.
w-- why aren't you, like, jumping up and down?
I've done this before.
this is d?
look, George, you didn't pass your intern test.
you know, it--it happens.
it's--it's nobody's fault.
right?
it's nobody's fault.
Yeah, it's just that callie gave cristina the study cards, and Meredith didn't write anything down, and Cristina was planning a wedding, and Izzie
Izzie just had to.
you know, I'm--I'm-- I'm responsible.
I've always been the responsible one.
I'm not saying,"what about me?
I'm not saying,"when do I get what I want?
when do I get to be someone other than the guy who repeats his intern year?
I'm not saying that, but- - but what about you?
Yeah!
I didn't plan on being here.
I was all set for an internship at mass gen.
and then.
my mother gets the hiccups, and I'm at a funeral.
you know, we all have problems.
mom die, and dad drink so much that they don't even know what year they're in, and sisters--I
I didn't even know that there was a Meredith Grey until a couple of months ago.
and she won't--she doesn't even want to talk to me.
I don't want to be here.
you know, I.
I'd giving anything to not be here.
you know, to--to have my life work out the way I planned, to even have time to ask,"what about me?
so you--you change.
you--you get over it.
I'm here now, so.
and you.
you delivered a baby today.
so.
stop feeling sorry for yourself.
you are kind of awesome.
I know.
Psych's prepared to consult on the patient?
thank you.
now whether you like it or not, you and I are gonna talk.
Chief- - I know you're angry and disappointed.
no, I'm not angry.
I'm not disappointed.
I'm speechless.
I don't want to talk because I am speechless.
it makes me speechless to realize you didn't think that.
I would've made an-- an excellent chief resident.
you're right.
you would've made an excellent chief resident.
but you'll make an even more excellent surgeon.
you belong in the O. R.Bailey.
focus on honing those skills, not on how well you can juggle schedules or fill out paperwork.
believe me, I know.
you'll thank me for this one day.
but not today.
I'm the one that could use a friend.
I said that you could use a friend. I could use a friend.
look, Mark-- no, I didn't come to seattle for addison.
I didn't come to seattle to be chief.
I came to seattle for you, okay?
I came to seattle to get you back.
I know. I want to take it back now, but I already said it, so.
maybe we should have a drink.
we could.
Yeah. Not today.
I know you didn't wake up this morning expecting this was how your first day was gonna go.
you thought you'd get to reattach an arm or observe brain surgery.
instead you helped save the life of a deer.
you can bitch and complain about it, or you can adjust your expectations.
cause like it or not, you're stuck with me.
and I'm the kind of doctor who lets a little kid convince her she can do the impossible.
Oh, plus, when I woke up this morning, I thought today was gonna go a lot differently, too.
I thought I was gonna get the good interns.
instead I get stuck with the duds.
so I have to adjust my expectations as well.
what? - We heard
we heard you delivered a baby today.
on your very first day as an intern.
Yeah.
what was it like? - did you do it all by yourself?
was it just like-- did your head just explode with the amazingness?
your very first day.
it was pretty cool.
he came out really fast.
I had to, uh.
you know, determine the position of the cord.
you know what a reverse trendelenburg is?
I filled this entire bag with coins from my patient's stomach today.
no kidding?
I miss Rebecca.
I miss Burke.
want some money?
change.
we don't like it, we fear it.
what?
you want to humiliate me some more?
cause I get it. I suck.
I suck at my job.
I suck as a wife.
I suck all around, so.
go ahead. Humiliate me some more, please.
hope tomorrow's better.
but we can't stop it from coming.
we either adapt to change.
or we get left behind.
I, um.
you're not ready for no.
I asked for too much.
I think so.
so this is it?
Yeah.
we're breaking up.
we're breaking up.
it hurts to grow.
anybody who tells you it doesn't is lying.
we're broken up.
it's done.
so a breakup kiss.
a breakup kiss.
and some breakup sex.
Yeah, breakup sex.
but here's the truth.
sometimes the more things change, the more they stay the same.
and sometimes-- oh, sometimes change is good.
I love you, too.
sometimes change is.
everything.
I'm in love with you, George, and I hope you're in love with me, too.
I was named chief resident.
I've failed my intern test.
you can start from the very beginning.
repeat my internship?
I met a woman last night. - Hi.
you met a woman last night?
I'm lexie. Lexie Grey.
he's gone.
I can't leave you, but you're constantly leaving me.
it's over...so over.
in the practice of medicine, change is inevitable new surgical techniques are created, procedures are updated levels of expertise increase.
innovation is everything.
nothing remains the same for long.
we either adapt to change...
or we get left behind.
I have five rules. Memorize them.
rule number one, don't bother sucking up.
I already hate you. That's not gonna change.
trauma protocols, phone lists, pagers. The nurses will page you.
you answer every page at a run-- a run. That's rule number two.
you're supposed to follow me.
your first shift starts now and lasts 36 hours.
you're grunts, nobodies, the bottom of the surgical food chain.
you run labs, you write orders, you work every second night until you drop, and you don't complain.
on call rooms. Sleep when you can, where you can.
you know, but not with anybody.
not attendings-- especially not attendings.
sleeping with attendings-- not a good idea.
where was I?
um, rule number three.
if you're sleeping, do not wake you unless a patient's actually dying.
the dying patient better not be dead when I get there, because not only will you have killed someone, you will have woken me for no good reason. Are we clear?
yes? - That was four rules. You said five.
rule number five-- when I move, you move.
go!
I hate them. You don't hate them. You hate you.
that was hideous. I feel like a fraud.
I rocked it. I think I'm the new nazi.
Oh, you are not the new nazi.
Meredith, I need to talk to you.
how was your vacation? - Um, fine.
um, Meredith, can we - 'Cause mine was...
I didn't do much. I hung out alone...for 17 days.
which is the last time that I saw you, the day of cristina's wedding, which was...well...
then Mer and Cristina went on Cristina's honeymoon without me.
girl-on-girl honeymoon.
and then Alex took a road trip to see Ava without me.
I did not go to see Ava. And her name's Rebecca.
and I didn't go see her. I just drove in that direction.
Oh, why is everyone so tingly and hurt?
I mean, I'm the one who was left at the altar.
I'm fine, by the way.
I honeymooned in Hawaii and I snorkled.
What'd you do, George?
um, Meredith... - I- I really need to talk to you.
uh, hey, you want to know
Hey, um, this is for residents only. No interns.
Yeah. - Yeah, get outta here.
babies. - Yeah, go away.
007s in traini.
seriously.
I guess I should be going, too.
no, George. We didn't mean you.
no, I'm an intern. - Wait. What did you want to tell me?
uh, is this how it's gonna be all year?
because bambi has got to learn how to cope.
at least he came back.
Yeah, cut him some slack.
dude, he failed his exam and got left back in kindergarten.
he won't even look at me.
have you seen Burke?
no. Have you seen Derek?
no.
wait, you haven't seen either of them since the wedding?
Nope.
and you're all fine?
Yep - Wow.
you're either incredibly healthy or completely messed up.
your interns are back from holiday today.
uh, not my interns. They're residents. I'm free.
right. Well-- here, nurse. The point is, uh, Dr. Yang.
the Burke thing-- she doesn't know.
I'm supposed to tell her.
Burke asked me to tell her. Any thoughts?
honesty always works best. - Yeah, that's true.
you want to get together for a drink after work tonight?
Why? - Well, I don't know.
I just thought it might be a good idea to get together and have. oh, you don't have anybody to talk to.
no, I have people to talk to.
Addison is gone, Burke isn't around, and you and Grey aren't smelling each other in the elevators anymore.
I have people to talk to. - Who?
I have...chief.
I- I have the chief to talk to. Hey, chief.
want to get together for a drink after work?
I don't drink. Dr. Bailey, we need to talk.
we have traumas coming in. - You're avoiding me. We need to talk.
about you choosing dr. Torres to be your chief resident over me?
respectfully, no, sir. We're not going to talk about that.
someone mention a drink later? 'Cause I'm in.
nobody mentioned a drink. - You mentioned a drink.
I did not mention a drink.
all right, people. We've got three M. V.C. S rolling in back-to-back from a multicar pileup.
we need every trauma room open and everyone suited up.
is there anything I- I should do, sir?
save lives. - No. I mean as, uh, chief resident.
anything in particular?
make sure your residents run their traumas.
this is their first day on their own.
Where...are the residents you've assigned to this E. R?
Oh. Oh, I, uh, I, uh, I paged them. I-- I paged them.
Bailey? - What?
uh, I,uh, paged, uh, Grey, Yang, Stevens and Karev, but they're not here yet.
when I page them, they come running.
get it together, Torres.
Yes, sir.
okay, you did not have to say that in front of the chief.
you asked...boss.
there's Derek.
is burke with him? - I don't see him.
where have you been? We have multiple M. V.C. S due any second.
we're here, aren't we? We're here.
just-- just get ready, okay? And monitor your interns.
okay, one, two, go get stat packs.
uh, three, four, go meet the ambulances.
one and two? - No, I can't remember their names.
I don't respond to being called a number.
George, go wait for the ambulance.
the rest of you come with me.
all right, you guys stand against the wall and out of the way unless I call for you.
okay, this is what's called a trauma situation.
so there's gonna be lots of activity and a lot of patients, so if you guys have any questions at all, just ask, okay?
I heard she, like, freaked out and killed a guy and had to go on probation.
great. We're stuck with a dud.
so, hey, you're an intern...again.
I won't tell anybody. The other interns, - I won't-- - That's--that's okay.
do you know which one is Meredith Grey?
Yeah, I haven't, uh, told her you're here yet. I was going to...
so you know who I am?
Yeah, I know who you are.
what's she like? I- I mean, is she nice?
cause-- 'cause my dad, he won't-- he won't tell me. Is sh--sh...
uh, Grey, don't let them just stand here.
let's move, people.
unrestrained driver, D.O. A. At the scene.
just need someone to pronounce him.
Oh, crap. Dead guy. Why'd you get me all excited with the sirens?
okay, who wants to see a dead guy?
Nancy Walters, 34 years old, weeks pregnant. Complete upper arm amputation.
pressure dressings applied. Two large bore I. V. S started.
did he say "arm"? My arm is gone?
miss Walters, you're gonna be okay. Grey, check the wound.
I really need my arm.
45-year-old male, sustained a knee injury.
that guy, the guy that's dead, he hit a deer, and then the lady hit him, and then I hit the lady.
knee is blowing up like a balloon.
Hey, I'm hungry. Can I get something to eat?
okay, everybody get a good look? Time of death-- 8: 22.
not time of death. This guy is not dead.
he was dead. - Well, he's not dead now.
let's bag him. Okay, we've got a
we've got a guy who's risen from the dead over here.
get outta the way!
are-- are you Meredith Grey? - Yeah.
I-- I'm Lexie. - Great. Move.
Lexie Grey. I'm-- I'm your sister.
that girl out there, the dopey, wide-eyed one?
apparently we're related.
Oh, you--you met lexie?
Oh, you knew. Knew about it and didn't tell me, huh?
I've...kind of had a lot thing on.
this is trauma room one. As you can see, it's
there's a trauma.
Hey, guys, do you need some help? Please tell me you need some help.
it's a little crded in here already, Iz.
what do you got for me?
uh, Nancy Walters. Complete amputation.
the baby looks fine, but she's having some contractionS.
Hi, Nancy. I'm dr. Sloan. You mind if I take a look?
it's a clean cut.
you want to rub up against me, you gotta buy me a drink first.
hang antibiotics and put on a sterile, moist dressing.
there's a chance at a good recovery here.
do we have an arm?
they're looking for it.
my baby has no father. He's already down two arms.
so he r-really needs me to have an arm.
get me that arm.
okay, somebody set up for a traumatic effusion drainage.
and order him 4 of morphine.
she means one of you morons.
get her an 18 gauge needle and a 20 cc syringe and the damn morphine.
Hey, uh, morphine's cool, but I'd kill for something to eat.
a healthy appetite after a trauma like this?
that's a very good sign, Joey.
you think he'll need surgery?
that depends on the x-rays.
knee looks good. No surgery.
okay. This is Cristina-- dr. Yang.
she's working.
Yep, saving lives and taking names.
so...I have these interns and nothing to do.
and, uh, I think I'm a really bad teacher.
and I think they hate me. And now I'm a fraud.
so any chance you wanna let me in on this? Please.
Izzie, this guy was dead, and now he's undead.
so that kinda makes him like a zombie my personal zombie. So no, you can't get in on this.
now go be A...fraud somewhere else.
I don't like you. - Mm-hmm.
let's go, people. - Excuse me.
you know, where have you been? I've been waiting for these.
I got--I was-- I met my sister, uh, for the first time ever...
Oh, hey. Which, uh, got me, you know, weird.
so then I got, um, lost on my way to x-ray 'cause I was all in my head, you know, about-- about meeting Meredith.
Meredith is your-- is your sister?
Meredith Grey. Lexie Grey. We're half sisters. So you know her?
Oh, we need to page dr. Shepherd.
Dr. Shepherd. He--he's the, um...neurosurgeon?
okay, somebody page Derek Shepherd right freakin' now.
Grey. Thank you.
thank you.
Hi. How are you?
I have a patient with a severed arm and no one seems to be able to find it.
have you seen it?
your severed arm? No, I haven't seen a severed arm.
Meredith, how - hey, um, I'm--I'm so sorry about before.
I just was so nervous about meeting you.
don't block the E. R.Doors. I know that now.
that was a good lesson.
you're the girl from the bar. - Sorry?
the girl from the bar?
Oh, my god. Yeah. Oh, my god. Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, my god. You--you work here.
Yeah, I do.
girl from the bar? - Mm-hmm.
I'm the girl from the bar.
uh...She hates me. My sister hates me.
Meredith is your sister? - My half sister, yeah.
Hey, uh, you're dr. Shepherd. - That's right.
I'm--I'm supposed to be finding you for a consult.
Hey. There you are. I missed you this morning.
Yeah, I didn't want to be late for my second first day as an intern.
maybe you can look at it like this-- you have one up on everyone.
you're gonna be, like, the rock star intern.
Yeah, I'm sure that's how everyone's gonna see me when they find out.
or maybe they'll see you as the daddy intern.
what?
wh-what did you just say?
oh...I'm not--I'm not pregnant. I just...
I mean, I might be pregnant.
Yeah, my boobs are a little sore, which...
Hey, I'm trying to cheer you up here, George.
this is-- I mean, if I am knocked up, that's a good thing, right?
Callie, I'm just a little distracted. I'm having a bad day.
okay, you're having a bad month.
okay, I'm having a bad month.
love you.
help! We need doctors. Help! - Inside voice.
uh, we found an arm in the road.
here, I bagged that - That's my arm.
dad, dad, tell them she's hurt! Dad, come on.
tell the doctor! Tell them she's hurt.
uh, any way we can go with the severed arm? - She's in the truck, and she's hurt.
is that your blood? Are you hurt?
she's in our truck, and she's not moving. v
she's bleeding really bad.
there's another crash victim.
we're gonna need gloves, I. V. S, gauze, ab pads, trauma gowns.
still want to babysit the arm?
come on
no way.
is she dead?
Michael, this is a hospital, and I'm a people doctor. I...
can you save her? - Michael, come on.
I'm sorry, but she's - roadkill.
she opened her eyes. Look. She's still alive!
Oh, god. Don't look at me like that. Or like that.
Michael, let's go back to the truck Come on.
please.
Oh, okay, all right. All right.
uh, I'm gonna need a jumbo catheter, a 16 gauge needle, the biggest ambu bag you can find and something that shaves fur.
what's the matter with you people? When I say move, you move. Move!
back of his skullis completely disconnected from his first cervical vertebrae.
he's been internally decapitateD. Holy crap.
Yeah, 90% of these die in the field.
and the other 10%?
I've never seen one live.
there's always a first time, though, right?
I mean, he came back from the dead.
Henry, I'm dr. Shepherd.
the back of your skull is disconnected from your spine.
I'm gonna try and reconnect it in surgery.
do you understd me?
blink once for yes, twice for no.
okay, good. I know it's scary, but I promise you, I'm gonna do everything I can.
do you have family?
all right. We're gonna contact them, okay?
all right, let's get him in a halo. - Uh-huh.
contact his family. find out if he's an organ donor.
you, finish up with the splint, then get him up on crutches.
Hey. How's Joey?
it's a hungry hippo missing a kneecap.
can't you assign me something good?
I don't switch out patients, Karev.
but it's not even surgical.
it's a waste of my skills.
you're staying here with Joey. - Come on.
No! - Fine. I'm going to Bailey
you are a resident. You go where I say.
my arm is gone.
we have the arm, and dr. Sloan checking right now to see if we can reattach it.
is there someone we can call?
there's no...no, I just...I just moved here.
I'm all-- I'm all by myself. There's no one. I have no one.
well, dr. Sloan should be here any minute.
I wanted a kid and...
I was sick of waiting for the right guy, so...
in my family...
in my family, you don't go out and get pregnant.
so now I'm alone and...
I'm having a baby, and I don't have a father for the baby, - and I don't have an arm. - it's okay.
here's dr. Sloan.
Nancy...I'm happy to report that your arm is in good shape.
Dr. Grey here is gonna clean it up a little, and
and I'm gonna put that arm back where it belongs, okay?
we got a 150-pound female with...
lacerations on the chest and haunches, short, fast breaths.
any recommendations?
uh, doctor, Michael's a big boy.
he doesn't need you to perform make-believe medicine, right, Michael?
it's not make-believe. She can help.
Michael, enough. I apologize. We're just wasting your time.
no kidding.
Michael. - Please don't let her die.
Michael, it is a deer.
we're gonna take her home and skin her and freeze the meat, okay?
what? Why?
because that's what you do. You don't try and save them. You eat them.
no, Dad. The doctor can save her.
no, she can't. - You don't know that.
my son needs to learn to grow up and face things.
you're right. I am not helping him.
I'm helping bambi.
so get me the ambu bag and the sane. I'm starting an I. V.
thank you.
still no sign of Burke. Oh, you've got a severed arm.
my arm. Mine. Get away from it.
maybe he's not on today.
maybe you should just see him and get it over with.
no, no, no, no.
if I never see him again, I won't care.
well, I've seen Derek, and Derek has seen me.
And? Awkward. Plus he seems to know Lexie.
And?
more awkward. Your intern is my half sister.
how weird is that?
well, I'm trying to save bambi's life.
my interns think I'm a loser.
severed arm. - Callie's a bitch.
word. - She won't let me off my patient, and there's nothing wrong with him except he's a nut job.
severed arm.
does anybody know anything about deer?
ey taste good.
evil.
Oh, George, severed arm.
plus Meredith's half sister is my intern, Izzie is playing dr. Dolittle, oh, and Alex hates your wife.
Dr. Sloan's ready for the arm.
I'll say it. - George is being an ass.
I think it's my fault.
I said some things, and now he's not talking to me.
I don't know what he's got to complain about.
those new chick interns are hot.
he's married, Alex. - Yeah, he's married.
you know who's seriously hot? That Lexie girl.
get out...before I hurt you.
I'm going over callie's head to bailey.
uh, Callie is over Bailey's head.
spiritually, Bailey's over everyone's head.
Dr. Bailey. How are things going?
I wouldn't know. Ask dr. Torres.
Miranda - I don't want to talk.
Miranda, it is not like you not to want to talk.
fine. How's your wife?
well, she's...she's...good.
I haven't moved back in yet.
she hasn't let me move back in yet.
she's not taking my calls. Wait.
that's not what I want to talk to you about.
I want to talk about chief resident.
now we're gonna have this conversation.
are you ordering me to stand here and talk to you about this, chief?
no, I'm not ordering you.
but I just thought we could - Okay, then. Good-bye, sir.
I talked to the family they're on their way.
good put an entire O. R. On hold. We don't have much time.
uh, can I get a progress note?
uh, do you maybe want to have a drink later?
what? - A drink.
give me one reason why we can't hang out.
I don't like you.
you don't like me because of Meredith?
I don't like you because you're you.
hmm. How is Meredith, by the way?
is she okay?
she's fine.
she's always fine. That's her problem.
we're fine people. We do fine. We're fine.
how's dr. Burke? I haven't seen him around.
is--is he off today?
here.
Dr. Burke handed in his letter of resignation two weeks ago.
he wanted me to tell you.
he's g-gone?
I'm sorry.
well, don't be. I'm - fine?
Yeah.
circulatory system of a deer? - Shut up.
uh, couldn't you use an extra set of hands in the O. R. Today?
I saw an appy on the board. I'm-- I'm great at appys.
talk to Torres. She's in charge of what cas you get now.
it's hard to set a shattered kneecap when your patient's in the pit, don't you think?
whatever.
I don't know how you did it.
did what?
get them to listen to you, to give you some respect.
Hey, dr. Bailey, you wouldn't happen to know anything about, uh, the anatomy of a deer?
not my intern, not my business, not anymore.
your husband's injuries are s-severe.
uh, they're traumatic in the extreme.
I'm sorry. What does that mean?
the only thing holding his head on to his body is skin and muscle.
if he moves even a fraction of an inch, it could kill him.
s-so are you saying that the
I'm--I'm saying that when you see him, this could be the last time
this could be the last time you see him alive.
are you in pain, sweetie?
good.
two blinks-- you aren't in pain.
why isn't daddy answering?
just-- right now we just need to wish daddy good luck in his surgery and tell him how much we love him. Okay?
cause we do.
I love you so much, Henry.
what's--what's three blinks?
uh, we've only been working with one and two.
is it "I love you"?
are you telling us you love us?
three blinks is I love you.
we're gonna be fine, Henry.
you're gonna make it, and we're all gonna be just fine.
it's time to go.
okay, guys. Let's let these doctors fix daddy up.
why are you avoiding me?
I'm on my way to surgery.
no, I don't mean right now. I mean.
not one word in 17 days?
I tell you that I love you, and not one word? Where have you been?
I've been right here.
you know where? Exactly where I was a year ago.
I'm sorry.
I--I'm freaking out.
I'm an intern again.
Yeah, we're all freaking out.
we're all freaking out.
I'm in charge of a group of interns who think I'm crazy.
and I might actually be crazy, because day one of me being in charge, and I'm obsessed with rescuing bambi.
we're all freaking out.
since when did you start calling me Bambi?
what? - I'm not calling you bambi.
no, I mean, I know I-I-- I under-- I expect it from Cristina or Alex, - but- - I'm Bambi.
I'm bambi, George, okay?
if anyone in this situation is a sad little cartoon character, it's me.
I'm all alone in the forest-- all alone in the forest, george
and my mother's been shot by a hunter, and where are you?
where the hell are you?
I'm on my way to surgery.
I am really up for a drink, you know?
if you, uh, need to talk.
what would i need to talk about?
you were lucky, man.
that girl jerked you around.
you have no idea what you're talking about.
Hey, I'm just seemed like you could use a friend about now.
Meredith's mother never wanted her.
and her father was never man enough to hang around.
she has a right to be damaged, and us, together, it's a big step for her.
her best friend gets left on the altar, and all she sees now is things like this, they don't work.
she panics.
she wants this.
she doesn't know how to have it.
and you know what?
that's not her fault.
so don't ever talk to me about Meredith Grey again, because you do not know what you're talking about.
and I don't need a friend.
okay, Nancy, I want you to count back from a hundred, okay?
no.
no. I'm not ready.
it's just like going to sleep.
I can't do any of this alone.
I don't want to be alone anymore.
I know.
no, I'm scared. - I know.
I am scared, Meredith.
I know.
I think it's very brave, what you're doing.
it's much better to be alone and feel like a success than to be in a relationship and feel like a failure all the time, right?
that's what I think.
so let's just take care of your arm, and then we'll deal with the rest later, okay?
well, it looks like I'm back to babysitting.
what the hell? Who took my clamps and the bandage scissors?
there's a foreign body.
his abdomen's rigid.
somebody page dr. Bailey right now.
go!
come on, Joey.
you like hamburgers, don't you?
Yeah.
and spaghetti with meatballs, and lasagna?
that's beef.
that's cow you're eating, son.
what do you mean?
could we have the "circle of life" lesson later?
I need to get in here.
sorry.
her eyes are glassy.
you, get in here and ventilate.
we're losing her.
this is absolutely childish and ridiculous.
no, it's not.
it's not childish to hold on to hope.
it's actually hard-- very, very hard.
your son just wants to believe that some things can work out for the best.
get me the paddles.
come on, come on, come on.
what's she doing?
insuring we never see the inside of an O. R. This year?
she's in v-fib. I'm gonna shock.
charge to 300 and stand back.
okay, clear.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god. She's alive?
it worked. She's okay. Everything's gonna be okay.
Oh, my god.
got a big bleeder.
Dr. Grey, press and hold right here.
she's having contractions.
well, take a look, George.
probably the stress.
no, these are strong, and they're two minutes apart.
call O. B. And get someone in here.
uh, I don't think there's time to call O. B.
her water just broke, and she's crowning.
call peds. Get a warmer in here.
this baby's coming now.
O'malley, get her up in stirrups.
can we put her in a reverse trendelenburg, have one of the nurses press her abdomen since she can't push?
try it without all the jostling.
I'm holding on to a major artery here.
okay, clamp.
scissors.
I got it.
I got him.
great job, George.
Thanks.
Yeah, yeah, we're all heroes.
now if no one minds, I'd like to get this woman's arm sewn on.
like she said, she's gonna need it.
I'm starting the fusion now.
did he just move?
Oh, he d-- he definitely moved.
the anesthesia's light.
yang, stabilize his neck. - okay, three, come and grab his feet.
go under the drape and do not contaminate the sterile field.
we need to keep him very still until he is under.
we can't risk even the slightest movement.
you cannot move.
do you hear me?
this is not an option.
everything is not gonna be fine if you move.
it will be the opposite of fine.
you cannot leave the people you love. They need you.
not just the memory that you love them.
anyone care to explain to me how my patient wound up in this O. R.
and I wasn't even informed?
Dr. Karev didn't page you because he knows how to prioritize.
ten minutes ago, this patient was coding from a perfed abdomen.
under the circumstances, dr. Karev's quick thinking is the reason that your patient is even still alive.
I'll expect a fully dictated chart before you leave tonight, Karev.
Ah, jackpot.
did he swallow those?
poor fool. He must suffer from pica, an uncontrollable urge to eat any and everything.
check it out-- a buffalo nickel.
Dr. Bailey, I saw you were scrubbed in.
I thought I'd stop by and see what you've got.
what I've got?
$2. 37, sir. In change.
it like a cute festival in here.
I delivered that one an hour ago.
Oh, my god.
w-- why aren't you, like, jumping up and down?
I've done this before.
look, George, you didn't pass your intern test.
you know, it--it happens.
it's--it's nobody's fault.
right?
it's nobody's fault.
Yeah, it's just that callie gave cristina the study cards, and Meredith didn't write anything down, and Cristina was planning a wedding, and Izzie
Izzie just had to.
you know, I'm--I'm-- I'm responsible.
I've always been the responsible one.
I'm not saying, "what about me?
I'm not saying, "when do I get what I want?
when do I get to be someone other than the guy who repeats his intern year?
I'm not saying that, but- - but what about you?
Yeah!
I didn't plan on being here.
I was all set for an internship at mass gen.
and then.
my mother gets the hiccups, and I'm at a funeral.
you know, we all have problems.
mom die, and dad drink so much that they don't even know what year they're in, and sisters--I
I didn't even know that there was a Meredith Grey until a couple of months ago.
and she won't--she doesn't even want to talk to me.
I don't want to be here.
you know, I.
I'd giving anything to not be here.
you know, to--to have my life work out the way I planned, to even have time to ask,"what about me?
so you--you change.
you--you get over it.
I'm here now, so.
and you.
you delivered a baby today.
so.
stop feeling sorry for yourself.
you are kind of awesome.
I know.
Psych's prepared to consult on the patient?
thank you.
now whether you like it or not, you and I are gonna talk.
Chief- - I know you're angry and disappointed.
no, I'm not angry.
I'm not disappointed.
I'm speechless.
I don't want to talk because I am speechless.
it makes me speechless to realize you didn't think that.
I would've made an-- an excellent chief resident.
you're right.
you would've made an excellent chief resident.
but you'll make an even more excellent surgeon.
you belong in the O. R. Bailey.
focus on honing those skills, not on how well you can juggle schedules or fill out paperwork.
believe me, I know.
you'll thank me for this one day.
but not today.
I'm the one that could use a friend.
I said that you could use a friend. I could use a friend.
look, Mark-- no, I didn't come to seattle for addison.
I didn't come to seattle to be chief.
I came to seattle for you, okay?
I came to seattle to get you back.
I know. I want to take it back now, but I already said it, so.
maybe we should have a drink.
we could.
Yeah. Not today.
I know you didn't wake up this morning expecting this was how your first day was gonna go.
you thought you'd get to reattach an arm or observe brain surgery.
instead you helped save the life of a deer.
you can bitch and complain about it, or you can adjust your expectations.
cause like it or not, you're stuck with me.
and I'm the kind of doctor who lets a little kid convince her she can do the impossible.
Oh, plus, when I woke up this morning, I thought today was gonna go a lot differently, too.
I thought I was gonna get the good interns.
instead I get stuck with the duds.
so I have to adjust my expectations as well.
what? - We heard
we heard you delivered a baby today.
on your very first day as an intern.
Yeah.
what was it like? - did you do it all by yourself?
was it just like-- did your head just explode with the amazingness?
your very first day.
it was pretty cool.
he came out really fast.
I had to, uh.
you know, determine the position of the cord.
you know what a reverse trendelenburg is?
I filled this entire bag with coins from my patient's stomach today.
no kidding?
I miss Rebecca.
I miss Burke.
want some money?
change.
we don't like it, we fear it.
what?
you want to humiliate me some more?
cause I get it. I suck.
I suck at my job.
I suck as a wife.
I suck all around, so.
go ahead. Humiliate me some more, please.
hope tomorrow's better.
but we can't stop it from coming.
we either adapt to change.
or we get left behind.
I, um.
you're not ready for no.
I asked for too much.
I think so.
so this is it?
Yeah.
we're breaking up.
we're breaking up.
it hurts to grow.
anybody who tells you it doesn't is lying.
we're broken up.
it's done.
so a breakup kiss.
a breakup kiss.
and some breakup sex.
Yeah, breakup sex.
but here's the truth.
sometimes the more things change, the more they stay the same.
and sometimes-- oh, sometimes change is good.
I love you, too.
sometimes change is.
everything.
=hi. baidu. com/vkuz=- Good Luck! You and me
I slept with Izzie.
george told me...everything.
you named me Ava, and I was more me as Ava than I'll ever be as Rebecca.
Dr. Hahn, I was pleasantly surprised to hear you were joining us today.
you remind me of myself when I was an intern...
focused, intense, cold.
my mother's dead, isn't she? - Yes.
let's do this once.
I'm fine. She's cremated.
I picked out a beautiful urn, and she's hanging out in the back of my closet.
any more questions about my dead mother, or can we get back to work?
pick me. Choose me. Love me.
you're the love of my life. I can't leave you.
but you're constantly leaving me.
imagine my disappointment when I wake up after five years and discover that you're no more than ordinary.
there's a reason surgeons learn to wield scalpels.
we like to pretend we're hard, cold scientists.
we like to pretend we're fearless.
pick me. Choose me. Love me.
but the truth is, we become surgeons because somewhere, deep down, we think we can cut away that which haunts us...
what are you guys doing up?
couldn't sleep. - Couldn't sleep.
weakness, frailty...
death.
what is that?
my mother.
happy freakin' Halloween.
you're moving out of Burke's place, huh?
Yes, sir.
my wife has filed for divorce.
I'm very sorry, sir.
at any rate, I need a place to live.
and Burke's place... I-I was there once.
I suppose actually it's your place now, right?
no, it's still burke's place.
now it's yours.
what are we looking at?
Meredith put her mom in a baggie and brought her to work.
I had to get her out of my closet. She was haunting me.
and now she's haunting us all.
I'm putting her to rest. - Meredith is cleansing.
in tribal culture, when one wants to cleanse the past, one cuts off all of one's hair and buries it in the earth.
you might try that, too.
okay, listen up.
today is a holiday, which means the pit will be overrun.
you've got the usual drunken stupidity...
and then you've got Seattle's annual chain saw pumpkin carving contest.
I love this city.
stay on your toes, stay on top of your interns, okay?
so we should round before heading to the pit or...
Yeah, you should direct your questions to Dr. Bailey, Stevens.
Oh, we're directing our questions to Dr. Bailey?
Oh, not you. Just Stevens.
why is Stevens directing her questions to Dr. Bailey?
because she's been sleeping with my husband.
all right, then.
have a good day.
okay, this is even more disturbing than your bagful of mommy.
his medication was due half an hour ago.
I mean, the man is living in the hospital while he waits on a heart.
Erin, honey.
I'm thinking it's kinda hard for anyone to take you seriously in your mouse costume.
see, I work with 5 year olds, dad.
my costume is appropriate. Hers is not.
look, I'm...I'm just saying, if you have time for Halloween costumes, you probably have time to provide my father with basic care.
Hi, I'm Dr. O'malley.
we'll take care of your father right away.
thank you.
you should always make sure they have their meds before you do anything else.
okay. - Thanks.
I like your costume.
Oh, well, Dr. Yang said that we c... .
Yang...is screwing with you.
Oh, I knew. Are you the doctor?
Oh, I am. - Good.
that's...that's good.
is your leg hurting you?
it's...it's not the leg.
it's the foot.
and...and it's no hurting so much as... as it's not mine.
something happened. I-I can't explain it.
but this...this foot does not belong to me.
It...it's...
it...
it...it feels like it's a corpse foot.
Oh, did you lose feeling in the foot? Is it numb?
no, it's...it's not numb.
it's just...
it's not mine.
please, I'm...I'm not crazy.
I-I work at a bank. I'm not crazy. Please.
I just... I-I need a surgeon.
I need you to get me a surgeon who will remove it.
a surgeon who will remove your foot?
a surgeon who will amputate your seemingly healthy foot?
Oh!
what is that?
it's charts. -Meredith.
it's my mom. - What?
I had her in the cubby, and she was freaking people out.
so I was just gonna go put her in the car.
do you think that's disrespectful, to leave her in the car?
it's a little...
it's not that strange. - Oh.
I'm trying to figure out how to put her to rest.
I can't shove her in the back of my closet anymore.
I have to deal with her.
well... - and this is me trying to evolve.
I'm trying here. So...
cubby or car?
you're asking me if I think you should put your mom's ashes in your cubby or your car?
okay, and you don't think that's very, very strange?
are those really your mom's ashes?
it's strange, right? It's strange.
are you lost?
no, my mom works in the cafeteria.
and she said I could come up here and look for Dr. Sloan.
do you know him?
um, can you take care of him? - Yeah.
can you...
take care of her?
good morning.
don't do that. Don't smile at me.
don't smile at her. Don't smile at me, either.
we're on to you. - We've compared notes.
compared notes? Really? - Mm-hmm.
compared notes, compared pickup lines compared techniques.
techniques?
identical. - Identical.
identical?
we formed a club. - Nurses unite against Mark Sloan.
are there any, uh, club activities?
Oh, man. You would not believe what just happened to me.
there's a, uh, kid looking for you. - What?
daddy?
what?
nicely done. - Thanks.
I'll be getting you back for that. - Looking forward to it.
you're not my father.
but I am hoping you'll build me some ears.
Dr. Karev, request for you.
curtain three.
Dr. Karev, I'm feeling a little under the weather.
and...and rather than risk spreading germs to the patients,
I thought I would head home for the day.
Norman, do you want to be a surgeon or do you want to go to bed?
because it's one or the other.
surgeons stand up through 10-, 12-, 15-hour surgeries without food, without bathroom breaks without complaints.
surgeons do not go home because we have a tickle in our throat.
well, it's not a tickle in my throat as much as...
make yourself busy, Norman. - Right.
all the moms in my town, they all dress up for Halloween.
so I was thinking, what would I want to be if...
if I had to dress up or what I...
and the only thing I could come up with, the only thing that I wanted to be...
was ava.
you found him.
you two know each other?
you know his parents?
his mom works in the cafeteria.
what's all this?
it's letters from the kids in my class.
letters to me.
he has the internal structure to hear, he just doesn't have a canal or external structure.
so I thought if I came in with my letters, Dr. Sloan might feel sorry for me and do the surgery for free.
uh, look, I'd like to help, I would if I could, but pro bono surgery...
you should probably know that on my way here this morning, three different people thought I was in a costume.
my head looks like a permanent Halloween costume.
just thought you should know that.
you're good.
pro bono surgery is not just about me giving you my time.
a surgery like this requires O. R.Time, an anesthesiologist, a general surgeon to remove the cartilage from your ribs, at least two surgical nurses.
couldn't you ask them for help?
I could, but I don't have any social capital.
the nurses hate me.
they've formed a club that's all about hating me.
and the other doctors don't owe me any favors 'cause I've never done any for them.
I'm sorry.
I wish I could help.
I would if I could.
I have social capital.
or I don't.
nobody knows me, but they knew my mother.
so maybe I can make this happen.
fine, make it happen. You manage that,
I'm all yours.
these people who knew your mother, do they know you brought her to work in a baggie?
Oh, you...
you didn't come for me. You...
you chickened out.
when I... when I was leaving, when I was...
when I asked you to give me a reason to stay, you chickened out, which I-I get.
I get that. It was a lot.
it was scary, and I-I know I can be kinda intense, but I thought...I thought...
Oh!
I thought after the... the chickening out part, I thought...
you would come for me.
I came back for you, which basically...
makes me a beggar.
I'm a beggar for Halloween.
and now you're mocking me.
I'm not mocking you.
we need...
to talk.
we will.
body dysmorphic disorder?
you can prescribe him some antianxiety meds to try to lessen the urgency he's feeling.
the man is requesting an amputation, and the best you can come up with is antianxiety meds?
Dr. Bailey.
chain saw contest time?
Yep.
Mr. Miller.
I have to get to the E.R.
but I'm gonna write you a prescription for some medication I think may help you.
medication?
I need... I-I need a surgeon.
a surgeon can take off the foot.
get me a surgeon!
I am a surgeon, and I can tell you right now that you won't persuade me or any other surgeon to do what you're asking.
please try this medication.
I have an earless boy. - I'm sorry?
Sloan has agreed to build him ears pro bono if you will donate the O.R.
and all the equipment... - I'm sorry, grey.
my pro bono slate is full.
there are protocols to be followed, all sorts...
of red tape. - Trick or treat.
get it? He's trick-or-treating...
for ears.
you know, my mother, she was big on pro bono surgeries.
O.R.2 is free at 6: 00 P. M.
thank you.
if you two need to talk, I could wait over there.
Why?
it's not like we have any secrets anymore.
Callie told everyone.
everyone. - Yeah, it's gonna be a long day.
Erin shanley, 34, massive head trauma when a brick came through her windshield.
G.C.S. of 3 in the field.
a brick came through her windshield?
damn kids were screwing around on a bridge, Halloween crap.
I'm looking at brain matter here.
I checked. She's a donor.
Oh, my god.
what?
her father's on three. He's waiting for a new heart.
it was awesome.
it was the sickest pumpkin head you ever saw.
and then the next thing you know, it's, like, blood gushing, and it totally stained my pumpkin head.
you don't say? - Made it even sicker, though.
I brought it in...the digit.
Oh, you have the finger?
Yeah, but it's, like, lodged in the chain saw.
wait.
it was right here.
who took my saw? - What...
sir, the cut isn't clean enough to consider re... - yo, who took my saw?
Oh...
Oh, no.
what is that noise? - I have no idea.
Aah!
Aah!
sick!
the tibial nerve is shot.
there's nothing salvageable here.
completely mangled.
I can't believe he held that saw to his leg long enough...
was he high?
no, I just gave him some morphine for the pain, but the tox screen was clean before that.
unbelievable.
all right, I'll finish the job.
yang, go ahead and prep him for complete amputation.
thank you.
thank you so much.
Hey, you okay?
Oh, severed limbs don't sit well with me.
just a little queasy is all. But I'm fine.
I'll help Dr. Yang.
okay.
got to love Halloween...
when all the crazies come out to play.
mm, I kind of get it.
I mean, I get that you can wake up one day, and your life doesn't feel like your own.
I heard...
about your marriage.
and if there's anything you need me to do to cheer you up, I'm around, day or night...
night in particular.
I was married.
I said "till death do us part," okay? In a church.
I mean, it was the church of Elvis, but still it was a church.
I just...
I can't believe this is my life.
I don't understand. How did this happen?
how could this happen?
injuries like these happen very quickly.
she probably didn't feel any pain at all.
M-mr. Shanley.
according to Erin's driver's license...
she was an organ donor.
and as next of kin, if you agree to take her off of life support, you could direct the heart to yourself.
she is young, she was healthy.
she would be a perfect match for you, sir.
could you just please go away?
Mr. Shanley, if you would just... -Please, please go away. Please.
Dr. O'malley will bring you to see your daughter if you like.
Oh! - Oh, so sorry.
excuse me. Oh, no, no.
you okay? - No apology necessary.
okay. - I'm Sydney, by the way.
Dr. Sydney Heron. General surgery.
big fan of your work. Yeah.
uh, we were seated together once at an M&M.
anyway, uh, now seems as good a time as any to make it official...
our introduction.
Ah, Derek Shepherd. Pleasure.
it's, uh, it's very, very nice to meet you.
nice meeting you, too.
you think she's pretty?
Yeah. I like cheerful people.
I can be cheerfuL.
I think the ashes thing makes that kinda unlikely.
Dr. Bailey, we're gonna help, uh, rebuild a little boy's ears today, pro bono.
and I thought maybe you could donate some time.
uh, thanks to the fine, upstanding citizen who cut off his foot on my watch,
I've got a mountain of paperwork.
on top of that, I promised to try and get out here in time to see my son in his Halloween costume.
is Tuck even old enough to know what Halloween is?
he's not, but his father is, and that's who I promised.
trick or treat.
for ears?
he's trick-or-treating for ears? - Yeah.
could you also persuade some of the surgical nurses to help out?
they seem to really like you.
trick or treat. - Uh, stop that.
all right, I'm in.
she's warm. It doesn't make sense.
I'm -'m sorry.
she's breathing with the help of machines.
the person that you knew...
isn't there anymore.
uh...
would you bring the paperwork?
you can have her...
have her...her organs. That's what she wanted.
and her heart?
give it to someone else.
we could scatter her off the roof.
she was afraid of heights.
they're ashes, meredith.
the ashes aren't acrophobic.
I need to put my mother to rest.
I need to not become her.
I need to not die emotionally crippled and alone.
and I need to not attend the wedding of Derek Shepherd and Sydney Heron.
I need to put my mother to rest.
just ask.
so you two are together?
Yeah.
like "together" together, in love together?
sexy love, not sibling love?
Yes. Yeah.
we're together.
and...you two have been...
I mean, without any of us knowing... doing this the whole time?
just once. - Iz.
I said she could ask questions.
just once.
and now we're waiting to...
be together...
out of respect.
for Callie's feelings.
she's not judging. - Right.
I have an earless boy waiting for me.
but...
I'm happy for you guys.
do you have to go?
no.
Norman can get by for a few more minutes without me.
how are you?
I mean, how have you been?
I'm in love with my daughter.
she's perfect. She's...
I mean, she sucks on her fingers. It's her new thing.
and she makes, like, this perfect little cartoon suckling sound.
and your husband?
my husband's in love with my daughter, too.
you look tired.
I haven't been sleeping much.
I haven't been sleeping much either.
the baby wakes up all the time.
not as much now that I figured out that if wrap her in whatever shirt I'm wearing...
she smells you.
and she sleeps.
what are we doing?
I mean, what are... what are we gonna do?
Dr. Hahn.
thank you for coming at such short notice.
Oh, not a problem.
are we harvesting the heart for U. N.O. S.
or is the recipient here?
I'm hoping the recipient is here, but he hasn't agreed yet.
I've never had much trouble talking a heart patient into taking a heart.
it's his daughter's heart.
okay.
get him to O. R. Two and page Torres. -Okay.
where are you going?
his daughter was in an auto accident. -Hey, uh, what's hahn doing here?
she's been declared brain dead... -Heart transplant.
don't even think about it. It's my patient.
Dr. Hahn, I understand you're doing a heart transplant today, and I thought I'd volunteer to scrub in.
Isobel stevens. She's my patient, the donor.
so if you need any information, I have it, all of it.
She's...she's my patient.
you've got some eager junior residents around here.
mm, lucky me.
take your pick.
well, Yang, I appreciate the offer, but I date men.
so I don't think you'll be able to impress me the way you've impressed your mentors in the past.
I...
what?
you sleep with them, right?
Preston Burke, Colin Marlowe... that's your thing.
it's my...it's... I'm...I'm sorry.
what does that have to do with anything?
my theory is if you had the chops in the O. R.
you wouldn't need to try to impress in the bedroom.
Stevens, is it?
it is.
let's go, Stevens.
you know, I bust my ass here, and Burke skips town with my cardio reputation.
so now instead of a heart transplant, oh, I get to participate in the amputation of a crazy man's foot.
I'm not... crazy.
cutting off your foot is crazy.
walking through your life like you have no power, like you have no say... no say in your own destiny...
like you have no control over your own body, walking through life like that is what's crazy.
I still think it's cutting off your foot with a chain saw that's crazy.
Mr. Shanley, I'm dr. Hahn.
the transplant team is in place if you're ready to say good-bye.
you must not have children.
I'm sorry?
if you had children, you'd never say that.
you'd never say,"if you're ready to say good-bye."
Mr. Shanley, I'm very sorry, but I want to suggest one last time...
no, I am not taking her heart.
I can't have my daughter's heart beating in my chest.
it would haunt me every day of my life. No!
all right.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
page me when he's ready.
Mr. Shanley...
I don't have kids, so I don't know what it's like to lose a child, but I do know what it's like to lose a parent.
your daughter loved you. I saw her this morning.
she was fighting for you.
she was fighting for your life.
you're her dad.
you're her dad. She didn't want to leave you.
I know that.
I also know that she would want you to have her heart.
I would've given my dad my heart if I could.
if I could've saved him...
I would've given him my heart.
all right.
it's not my fault Hahn chose me. -Whatever.
I can't believe that you are judging me.
that after what Hahn said to you, that you are judging me.
it's not the same thing.
it is the same thing.
it's exactly the same thing.
I'm sorry that I hurt Callie.
I didn't mean to hurt her.
you slept with her husband.
I slept with my boyfriend.
it's not the same thing.
Meredith slept with another woman's husband.
Meredith slept with another woman's husband.
the two of you are like this closecircle.
you can commit whatever crime you want, and in your little circle, it's all fine.
I...
I know that you didn't sleep with Burke to get ahead.
and if Hahn had asked me, I would've defended you.
I'm not even asking you to defend me.
I'm asking you to just cut me an inch of slack.
and believe me when I say that I am sorry I hurt Callie.
we are not a closed circle.
you are.
Dr. Shepherd. -Yes.
here's a question... were there actual shepherds in your lineage?
I'm sorry. What?
you know, shepherds. The ones who watch over sheep.
I mean the geneology My name for example, not actually after the bird
you know, I...I'm sorry.
would you excuse me? -Of course.
okay, thank you.
Yeah, you did this.
payback's a bitch.
Oh, man. What the hell did you tell her?
I put the word out that you were lookin'.
that I'm looking?
lookin'.
it sounds way dirtier without the G.
and you wonder why they formed a club?
you heard about that?
okay, so we have one plastic surgeon, a general surgeon, an anesthesiologist, one, two, three scrub nurses and an O. R.
let's call your mom, kid.
you're gonna get some ears.
he cut off his foot.
he cut off his perfectly good foot.
well, people do some very strange things.
Oh, well.
I had the world's shortest marriage.
I was left in a church while I was literally wearing a wedding dress.
george cheated on me right in front of me, and I missed it.
Burke sent his mother to say good-bye to me.
I'm gonna be a divorce.
now Erica Hahn thinks I'm a fraud.
I'm, uh, I'm not feeling very...
Oh, crap.
what?
my intern, something happened.
I don't know what.
we need to talk.
well, we will. I'll come back. Okay?
okay.
don't chicken out.
you know, I'm impressed.
I didn't think you'd pull this off.
I'm actually pretty surprised myself, considering it was my first time trick-or-treating.
your first time?
my mom never made it home in time to take me, never got it together to make me a costume.
plus she said it was rude to knock on people's doors and beg for food.
what?
just...
the apple fell pretty far from the tree, huh?
Dr. Karev, you want to slow down?
I just heard.
did he have a stroke? -He did.
3 inches to the left, he'd never talk again.
Yeah, but it's gonna be okay, right?
no way to know till we get the clot out and he wakes up.
but he...but he's gonna be okay... Karev, stop talking.
is your marriage really over?
I'm sorry. -Thanks.
did meredith really bring her mom's ashes to work?
look at that.
not a bad day's work.
paddles.
let's see what we've got.
there it is.
there it is.
Norman, come on, come on, come on.
what happened?
I just saw a heart transplant.
I just helped build a little boy some ears.
that's cool.
I dug up my mom's cat.
what?
my mom didn't leave any instructions 'cause it was so...
unexpected.
so...
we had to figure out on our own what she would have wanted.
and my mom loved that cat.
so...
I dug her up... the cat...
um, from her little grave in our backyard.
and I snuck into the cemetery in the middle of the night and reburied her right beside my mom.
and...
it was creepy and morbid, carrying around a dead, decaying cat in the cemetery in the middle of the night, but...
it made my mom really happy.
at least...
I like to think it did.
Thanks.
you're welcome.
look, Tucker, I said I'm sorry.
no.
I didn't...
no, I...
perfect.
Hi.
we just put a man's daughter's heart in his chest.
his daughter's heart?
well, that just makes you want to throw up, now doesn't it?
you all right?
you're Dr. Bailey. You hear everything.
and if you haven't heard everything, I'm sure you've heard.
about your marriage?
Yeah, I probably would've.
I'm sorry...
if I...
disappointed you.
I'm not your mother, O'malley.
I have to apologize to her now, too.
look, you're not a bad guy.
and I don't mean to let you off the hook entirely, because what you did was unkind and hurtful and wrong.
but you're not a bad guy.
I'm...I'm just saying, it...
it takes two.
to reach the point you reached in your marriage, it takes two.
I mean...I mean, I'm here late at night, Halloween, helping an earless boy get ears, and my husband wants to act like that isn't an important thing.
he wants to act like...
it isn't a good thing that I did today.
now that isn't just on me.
that's him wanting things to be the way he wants.
that's him wanting things to be purely black-and-white.
I mean, I missed my son's first Halloween, and my heart is aching inside of my chest, but, you know, that doesn't mean anything.
it...it doesn't count because in a black-and-white world,
I simply didn't make it home, and that makes me the bad guy.
you know, always. I'm always the bad guy.
you hear what I'm saying?
sorry you missed your son's first Halloween.
look, what I'm saying to you is...
okay, I was there. All right?
I was there the day your father died.
I was there when you came back from Vegas, married after a week and...
all I'm saying is...
it's not black-and-white...
and you're not a bad guy.
I did not sleep my way to the top.
I'm attracted to a talent that resembles my own, not that it's any of your business.
your comments were unprofessional and inappropriate.
you know what? You're inappropriate and unprofessional.
this is gonna be so much fun.
Dr. Yang, did you hear?
Dr. Hahn has agreed to become our new head of cardiothoracic surgery.
lookin' forward to it, dr. Yang.
you can't have my apartment.
I'm...
sorry I didn't listen when you said you weren't feeling well.
I'm sorry I didn't answer your page.
do you know why I chose surgery?
no.
I'm a little south of 60 and blood makes me squeamish.
see, I wanted to go into psych because I like to talk.
I've noticed that.
but I had this voice in my head telling me to choose surry.
it was as if...
my Mary Beth was whispering in my ear.
and so I listened.
and do you know what I think now?
no.
I think I was about to have a massive stroke...
and my Mary Beth wanted me to be surrounded by...
world-class surgeons when it happened.
so what are you gonna do now?
uh, well, I'm gonna go into psych.
because you people, you surgeons, my god...
you're all just a bunch of little children running around with your scalpels and your severed feet and your inappropriate sex in inappropriate places.
you all need a good shrink.
Dr. Grey?
Hi.
Hi.
I had a goldfish, and when he died, we flushed him down the toilet, back to the sea.
okay.
back to the sea is better than your cubby.
you okay?
I don't know if I can handle one more night in that hotel.
what's the matter with you?
I have to start dating.
it isn't just surgeons.
the truth is, I don't know anyone who isn't haunted by something...
or someone.
and whether we try to slice the pain away with a scalpel or shove it in the back of a closet, our efforts usually fail.
we made it through this day.
Yeah, we did.
we made it through this day.
so the only way we can clear out the cobwebs is to turn a new page...
uh, so it's the kitchen, uh, bedroom, bathroom.
there's the sofa.
you can sleep here.
great.
so, uh...
do you mind if I clean up a little?
Yes.
I mind a lot.
or put an old story to rest...
chief.
what are you doing, grey? This is a sterile environment.
it's my mother.
and I think this is where she'd want to be.
should we say a prayer?
she didn't believe in anything.
finally, finally to rest.
ashes to ashes.
dust to dust.

I Need To Not Die Emotionally Crippled And Alone.
Callie... What I Did To U I-Is Unforgivable.

and Unprofessional. Dr. Hahn Has Agreed To Bome Our New Head Of Cardiothoracic Surgery.

<I> there's This Thing</I> <I> About Being A Surgeon--</I>

okay.
the More Available He Gets, The More I Pull Away.
what Do You Mean?
nothing. It's A Derek Thing.

<I> 'cause They're Tougher</I> <I> Than That.</I>

ma'am, Okay. We Need To Do Our Jobs, En.
and You're Making That Difficult By Hovering Over The Patient.
P-please Have A Seat And Breathe.
I Heard We Have A Skydiver Who Fell 12, 000 Feet.
that'd Be Me.
uh... Hello.
Hi.
he's Talking?
clearly He's In Shock,
can't Feel The Extent Of His Injuries.
let's Get Him Down For A C. T.
Cristina, Where Are You Going?
multiple Injuries Means Multiple Surgeries.
I'm Going To Get Me Some Cardio.
okay, Do You See That You're Bleeding All Over The Dress?
it's Not About The Dress. I Can't, Uh, I Can't
there's Too Much Blood Down Here.
which One Of Your Legs Is Bleeding?
I Don't Know. I Can't Really Feel Anything Anymore.
I Hear You Have A Broken Nose Down Here.
what's With The Dress? It's N<I> About</I> The Dress.
can't They--Can't They Just Split The Prize?
I Offered. I Offered That 14 Hours Ago.
it Is A $100, 000 Wedding Package,
and I Am Not Splitting It With Anyone.
you're Bleeding On Your Dress.
it's Not About The Dress!
I'm Gonna Have To Stabilize That Shoulder Somehow. I'll Go Grab A Sling.
well, This Is Cozy. This Is Hell.
I Assigned O'malley To You To Keep Him Away From Me,
and Now Our Paients Are Connected To Each Other.
you're Not Looking At This Like The Opportunity It Is. Meaning?
meaning He's An Intern.
it's, Like, Half My Job, Torturing Interns.
Thanks. That's-- That's Almost Sweet.
but Torturing George Is Not Gonna Make Any Of This Any Better.
torture Him How, Exactly?
my Hands Always Get So Sweaty In Hospitals.
it's The Weirdest Thing.
it's Pretty Common, Actually.
if It Makes You Feel Any Better,
Dr. Hahn Has Done This Procedure Hundreds Of Times.
and She's Really Gonna Thread A Catheter Up My Leg,
all The Way To My Heart?
trust Me, You Are In Excellent Hands.
but, Um, I--I'll Be Out, Right?
Oh, Yeah, You'll Be Asleep. You Won't Remember A Thing.
ivory-billed Woodpecker. I'm Sorry?
ivory-billed Woodpecker
that's What's Getting Me Through This.
I'm A, Uh, Lifelong Birdwatcher.
and when I Get Through This,
I Am Finally Going To Scout The Ivory-Billed Woodpecker.
it Is So Rare.
you Know, We--We Thought It Was Extinct.
but It's Not.
it Lives In Arkansas...
in This One Little Patch Of Swamp.
do You Have Any Idea How Incredible It Is To See A Bird Like That In Person?
I'm Sorry.
uh, I'll Be Just One Second.
why Are You Hovering?
guess What Just Came Into The Pit.
no, No, Don't Guess. I'll Tell You.
Skydiver.
skydiver Whose Chute Didn't Open,
who Fell 12, 000 Feet And Landed In Some Shrubbery.
Wow. Poor Guy. He Probably Broke Every Bone In His Body.
no, The Point Is Not Poor Guy.
the Point Is Amazing Surgery.
and It Could Be Yours For The Low, Low Price Of A Humdrum, Everyday Cardio Cath.
Yeah, Forget It. I'm Not Giving Up Hahn's Service.
Hey, Hey, Izzie, You Know what? Cardio Is My Thing.
no. I Like This Patient, I Like Hahn,
and I Like Cardio.
no, You Are-- You Are Flirting With Cardio.
I Am Married To Cardio.
you Will Marry General Surgery
or, You Know, Okay, Perhaps Neuro.
but You, You Are Nowhere Near Hard-Core Enough
to Commit To Cardio.
so You Are Telling Me To Stop Flirting With Your Husband.
I Get It. That's Cute.
but If You're Gonna Ask Me For A Favor,
insulting My Personal Life Is Probably Not A Great Tactic.
no, No, No, Wait. I Am Not Talking About Your Sex Life.
I Could Not Care Less About Your Sex Life.
it's A Skydiver, Izzie. Skydiver.
Oh, Yeah. Sounds Real Cool. Enjoy It.
if His Intestines Look Like I Think They Will,
that's Gonna Take First Priority.
he Could Have Delayed Paralysis.
this Is Not A Contest, Gentlemen.
but Since A Perforated Bowel Could Kill The Guy
whether Or Not His Spine's In Working Order,
my Money's On The Chief Going First.
Hey, What'd I Miss?
any Cardiothoracic Concerns? I'd Be Happy To Page Dr. Hahn.
sc's Coming Up. Here It Is.

I'll Be Sick...

I Wish To God He Had.
I Swear, If You Let Go And Lose This Contest After My Jackie Almost Died To Win It

in Surgery For You Right Now? I Can Have Surgery Anytime.
I Can Only Win This Wedding Once.
so What, Heust Stands There And Holds A Dress?
I Know. I Thought It Was Gonna Be More Exciting, Too.
a Monkey Could Hold A Dress.

it's The Only Way To Get Through It.
sweetie, He's Your Competition. Don't Help Him.

I Drowned.
I S Sinking...
I Died.
do You Know What I Realized?
I Realized How Stupid All Of My Issues Are.
I'm Waiting For How This Applies To Me.
it Doesn't. Of Course Not.
well, That Man Fell,
and All He Wanted Was One Last Chance
to Tell Sally How He Felt About Her.
and I Got One Last Chance.
I Got My Chance.
and What Have I Done With It?
you Know, Being Aware Of Your Crap
and Actually Overcoming Your Crap
are Two Very Different Things.
I Know.
ha! Okay, Found It.
Dr. Hahn, I Know How You Can Do The Surgery On The Patient Who Is Allergic To Anesthesia.
well, No Anesthesia Means No Ventilator.
no Ventilator Means No Cabs.
not A Whole Lot Of Wiggle Room There. You Can Operate On Him
yang-- You Can Use A High Thoracic Epidural
to Numb Him From The Chest Down.
let Him Breathe On His Own The Entire Time.
I Mean, They Pulled It Off In India Last Month,
and Again In-- Dr. Hahn, You Wanted To Sign The Discharge Papers For Mr. Arnold?
not Quite Yet.
wide Awake?
you Want Me To Let You
slice Open My Chest While I'm Wide Awake?
it Is Your Best Option.
uh, How... How Long Would I Have To Be Lying There, Uh,
on The Table With Chest Open, Uh, Like That?
the Surgery Can Take Up To Five Or Six Hours.
maybe More.
uh, Six hours...
awake... W-With You Operating On My Heart. I...
the Ivory-Billed Woodpecker.
what? What?
the Ivory-Billed Woodpecker. Mr. Arnold , you Want To Live To See It, Don't You? This Is Your Only Chance.
ivory-billed Woodpecker.
excellent.
Stevens, We Will Scrub In As Soon As An O. R. Is Free.
uh, But The Surgery Was Cristina's Idea.
either You Want In Or You Don't which Is It?
I Do. Uh, But
I'm Sure There'll Be Standing Room In The Gallery, Yang.
Stevens, Book The O. R.
uh, Chief. Awake Open-Heart Surgery?
I Want To Talk To You About Tonight.
have You Heard About This Awake Open-Heart Surgery?
I've Invited Sloan And, Um, Well, I'm Wondering What I Should Tell Him To Expect.
tell Him To Expect A Good Time.
okay, So What Is That, Poker, Cigars, Whiskey?
I Mean, What Kind Of Things?
a Good Time, Shep.
you Know?
you Have No Idea The Kind Of Stamina It Takes To Stand In A Display Window For Two Days.
it's The Hardest Thing I've Ever Done,
like, Ever.
you're Risking Permanent Damage To Your Shoulder
over A Contest.
what Does Your Dress Look Like?
strapless, Sweetheart Neckline,
crystal beading, so Pretty.
but You're Gonna Wear Your Hair Down, Though, Right?
you Know, To Cover The Hunchback? The What?
Oh, It's Just, Since You're Ignoring Dr. Torres' Advice
your Shoulder Is Probably Gonna Be Pretty Swollen
and Purple--You Know, Kind Of Like A Hunchback
but Your Hair Should Totally Cover It.
I Mean, Probably, With The Right Veil.
you Didn't Tell Me That.
how Soon Can We Have The Surgery?
Dr. Hahn.
I Heard A Crazy Rumor About You.
that I'm Performing Open-Heart Surgery On A Man Who's Wide Awake?
that's The Rumor. That's The Truth
well, I Perform Awake Brain Surgery All The Time.
not The Same Thing. Not The Same Thing.
you Ever Heard Of A Gentlemen's Evening? I'm Sorry?
the Chief Is Hosting A Gentlemen's Evening.
we're Pretty Sure It Doesn't Involve Porn,
but, You Know, We Want To Be Sure.
right.
are You Two A Couple?
no. No.
just Checking.
why Would She Ask That? I Don't Know.
I'm--I'm Worried About This Gentlemen's Thing.
George... You Got A Second?
Seriously?
one Second
Hi. Hi.
we're Gonna Have To Push Back Our Perfect Evening Tonight.
not By Much-- A Few Hours, I Think.
sure. Okay. Okay.
I'm About To Scrub In On An Awake Open-Heart Surgery.
a What? Awake.
the Patient's Gonna Be Wide Awake While We Operate On His Heart.
that Is Intense. It Is. IT is...
you Know, Cristina Would Be All Over This.
she Would Be Studying And Quizzing Herself,
and All I Can Think About Is--Is The Poor Guy.
you Know, He's Really Nervous Already,
I'm Not Hard-Core.
I'm Not Hard-Core Enough For This.
Yes, You Are.
what, You're Just-- You're Just Not Like Cristina.
you're Hard-Core.
you're Hard-Core Like Izzie.
did That Just Sound Dirty? 'Cause That's Not How I Meant It.
mean It, Man.
shut
go Kick Ass In The Surgery, And Then We'll Have Our Night,
and It Will Be Perfect. Oh, I Have Not Shaved My Legs Yet.
go Be Hard-Core Izzie. Go.
okay, Got It. Going. Go.
thank You. Bye.
she's Hot, Man.
is She Your Wife?
I Don't Know You Well Enough To Have This Conversation.
chief, You Paged?
close The Door.
you Had The Nerve To Tell A Patient
you Would Perform Awake Open-Heart Surgery Without Running It Past Me?
did Burke Run Every Surgery Past You?
Erica, I Know You're New Here... No.
but We Run-- I Just Want To Know What The Rules Are.
every Surgery Burke Booked, He Ran It Up The Flagpole First?
and What About Pretty And Prettier?
they Run All Their Surgeries Past You?
wait, You're Talking About???
I Am Talking About Your Male Attendings.
you Know, The Ones You Invited To Your Gentlemen's Evening?
guess You Don't Know A Guy Till You Work For Him.
I Mean, Who Knew You Were Running Some Kind Of Old Boys' Club?
no, That Is Not It. You Realize That An Evening
to Which The Male Attendings Are Invited And The Women Are Not
you Realize That That's A Lot Like When Law Firms Used To Have Countryclub Weekends
and Failed To Invite The Black Sociates?
good Talk. I Gotta Prep For My Surgery.
remember When I Was Dead?
before I Went In That Water,
everything Was So... Complicated And Hard.
and Then You Pulled Me Out Of The Water.
and I Came Back To Life.
for A Moment, Everything Was So Clear...
as If The Water Had Washed Everything Clean.
do You Remember That? I Do.
me, Too.
I Don't Know How You Guys Did This For Two Days.
believe Me, I Would Be At City Hall Tomorrow
if That Were An Option.
it Is An Option.
you Could Just... Let Go.
you Let Go.
you Let Go, And It's No Big Deal. It's Wedding.
I Let Go, And I Have to Face The Wrath Of Dr. Sloan.
my Mom Manages A Grocery Store,
and Ever Since I Got Engaged, She's Been Putting Herself Into Serious Debt
over Hand-Engraved Place Cards And Chocolate Fountains.
it's Her Dream.
my Wedding Is Her Dream.
this Is So Important To Her.
this Is What She's Been Living For Since I Can Remember,
since... My Dad Left.
my Perfect Night.
so... I Can Do This.
I Can Do This For Her...
because She's Done A Lot For Me.
get Me A Crash Cart , Right Now.
must Have Happened When She Fell This Morning,
which Means She Was Bleeding All Day.
she Seemed Just Fine.
she Must Have Been Feeling Some Major Pain.
Yeah, Holding On To That Dress, That Wasn't Easy For Her.
was Humiliating. It Was
but When Someone's Trying To Break You,
it Gives You Drive, Gives You Strength.
holding On To That Dress For Hours--I Mean, Days--You Know, Just...
and In Public, Refusing To Buckle,
refusing To Beg-- That Hard-Core. I Mean, In Its Own Way, That's Seriously Hard-Core.
rumor Has It That Sloan Was Busy Hazing One Of His Interns Today.
I Take It You Didn't Buckle.
no, Sir.
good Man, O'malley.
I Can't Feel Anything From The Neck Down.
it's Almost Like The Rest Of Me Just...
doesn't Exist.
okay, The Sound You're About To Hear, That's The Saw.
that--that's Not A Pretty Sound
I Brought You Some Music.
just Listen To This And Tune It All Out.
and--and--and That Smell.
that--that Smell Is Not--That's The Cautery
I-I Know It's Hard, But You'll Get Used To It.
in A Moment Or Two, You Won't Even Notice It. I Promise.
he Jumped Out Of That Plane.
no One Forced Him To Do It. Fell 12, 000 Feet.
people Chasing Death Down,
then Trying To Cheat It. Doesn't Make Any Kind Of Sense To Me.
there's A Clarity Thing.
when You Cross Over The Edge,
there's A Moment When Everything...
just Melts Away,
and You're Fearless.
I Get It.
I Understand Wanting To Feel Like That.
Hey. Hi There. You're Awake.
did I Win?
you Should Know That Your Surgery Went Very Well.
but Who Won? I-Is She Still Holding On?
Helena Collapsed. She's In Surgery.
so--so I Won?
she--she Collapsed, Which-- Which Means I Won, Right?
Where--Where's The Judge?
you--the Woman That You Stood Next To For Two Days Almost Died.
okay, You've Just Woken Up From Surgery,
and All That You Can Think About Is If You Won A Stupid Contest?
don't You Get It?
you--you Shouldn't Have To Fight This Hard For A Wedding.
you Fight For A Marriage,
and Sometimes Even That Is A Lost Cause.
sometimes You Have To Know When To Let Go.
so Just Let Go Already, All Right? Just Frickin' Let Go.
but... D-Did I Win?
Izzie Stuck A Picture Of A Bird On Empty Saline Bag And Put It In His Eyeline.
that's Smart. I Wouldn't Have Thought Of That.
Yeah.
she Doesn't Let Me Take Care Of Her.
it's Not My Job Anymore.
she Won't Let Me.
I'm Taking Care Of Her.

Hey, Richard, You Gotta Tell Us What This Evening Is About.

and Honestly, I'm Kinda Hung Up On Somebody Else. So...
the Only Thing You're Ever Gonna Get From Me Is Sex. That's It.
and, Uh, That's Never Enough For Girls Like You.
<I> deep Down, Everyone Wants To Believe</I> <I> They Can Be Hard-Core.</I>
<I> but Being Hard-Core Isn't Just</I> <I> About Being Tough.</I>
Oh, This Is Just Unfair!

Oh, No. Don't Do That.
you'll Just Get Strung Out And Turn Into A Bad Afterschool Special.
we'll Just Sleep, And... You'll Sleep.
I Can't Stop, Cristina.
I Just Can't Stop Seeing Derek.
and It's Not About The Sex. It's Not... About The Sex.
it's About That Moment Afterward...
when The World Stops.
it Just Feels So Safe...

I'm Not Ready To Give That Up.

a Little Bit.
what Do I Do?
I Don't Know.
<I> you Don't Have To Be Tough</I> <I> Every Minute Of Every Day.</I>
<I> it's Okay To Let Down</I> <I> Your Guard.</I>
<I> in Fact, There Are Moments</I> <I> When It's The Best Thing U Could Possibly Do...</I>
<I> as Long As You</I> <I> Choose Your Moments Wisely.</I>
Alex, Please Tell Me That You Don't Live With Meredith Grey.
pick me. Choose me. Love me.
I need to not die emotionally crippled and alone.
Callie... what I did to you is unforgivable.
so you two are together?
you know what? You're inappropriate and unprofessional.
Dr. Hahn has agreed to bome our new head of cardiothoracic surgery.
lookin' forward to it, dr. Yang.
my wife has filed for divorce.
I don't know if I can handle one more night in that hotel.
you can say anything to me.
I want to marry you, and you're not ready.
there's this thing about being a surgeon
maybe it's pride or maybe it's just about being tough
but a true surgeon never admits they need help unless absolutely necessary.
what are your other symptoms?
okay, there's the father thing...
the mother thing, the sister thing...
mm, the dying-and-coming-back- to-life thing. -You have too many things.
I can't sleep.
I can't sleep without the dreaming.
and the panic attacks.
one. One panic attack. -Okay, still.
what's wrong with me?
as far as I can tell, severe abandonment issues.
that's crap. Psych is crap.
issues?
I mean, it's-- it's in the book. The book said it, not me.
have you considered maybe you and Derek should...
stop having breakup sex?
okay.
the more available he gets, the more I pull away.
.
what do you mean?
nothing. It's a derek thing.
surgeons don't need to ask for help 'cause they're tougher than that.
surgeons are cowboys-- rough around the edges, hard-core.
least, that's what they want you to think.
Ah, good morning.
Oh, perfect timing.
trout for breakfast.
again.
Yeah, don't start. I let you live on my land, so don't--don't start.
I'm older than you. I've just seen life from both sides now.
you gonna start singing?
I'm just saying that a man who is up fishing at 3: 00 every morning is a man in pain over a woman.
Oh, good. A country-western song.
I'm pointing out it's a thing we have in common, Derek.
you know, what we need is something to take our mind off of everything.
what we need is a gentlemen's evening.
a what? -A good, old--fashioned gentlemen's evening...
tonight.
this is absurd.
you shouldn't be sleeping in the on call room.
it's not always an on call room. Sometimes it's a gurney in the tunnels and the...
it's absurd...
when I have a perfectly good bed.
and I know that we said we would wait and be respectful, and we have been very respectful.
but now I want sex.
right now? -no.
tonight.
tonight we will have hot, perfect sex.
you in? -Yeah, I'm obviously in.
I gotta go.
I got patients to check on, Erica Hahn to impress.
I'm gonna go kick some cardio ass. Oh, god. I gotta shave my legs.
it's okay if you don't, you know, have a chance to shave your legs.
no, it's not.
it is not okay, George. I have to shave my legs.
I will be shaving my legs. Hot, perfect sex requires shaved legs.
okay.
Erica Hahn-- first day.
Oh, first day indeed, and a mountain of paperwork to prove it.
Derek shepherd, you know Erica Hahn.
you're the new burke.
and this is Dr. Mark Sloan, head of plastics. Erica Hahn.
Ah, the new burke.
welcome. Excuse us.
interesting guys, and by "interesting" I mean "ridiculously attractive."
do you hire on looks alone, or is actual skill a factor?
good to have you here, Erica. -Good to be here, Richard.
what exactly is a gentlemen's evening?
I don't know. It's an evening with gentlemen.
and strippers?
no, I don't--I don't think the chief meant strippers.
sure sounds like strippers. Dr. Bailey?
what's the first thing that comes to mind when I say the words "gentlemen's evening"?
tassels. Shiny, sequined tassels and $1 bills.
see? Strippers.
there will be no strippers. I'm almost positive.
so you don't know what this thing is either?
no, but you're in?
why not? I like to be surprised.
okay. Oh, heads-up. Mr. Incredible, 12: 00.
Hi.
Hi.
what the hell was that about?
that was about a date we have later in the on call room. It's nothing.
well, you sure seem to be losing sleep over a whole lot of "nothing.
this is it-- Hahn is in the hospital, freakin' Izzie is on her service again.
I'm gonna ride this trauma train straight back into cardio.
okay, what do we got?
uh, two ambulances, multiple traumas.
any chance you need a resident's help, Dr. Torres?
as long as you want to smash bones into dust while people cry.
sweet. What do you got?
chest pain, tamponade, ruptured aorta?
uh, more like a clown car.
Jackie Escott, 25 years old-- dislocated shoulder lac to her thigh, vital signs are stable.
and Helena Boyd, 26 years old
also stable with obvious nasal fracture facial lacs and a chunk of missing scalp.
she ripped out my hair. -She ripped out my shoulder!
you out your own shoulder when you were trying to push me off of the platform!
who let go of the dress? Did anybody let go of the dress?
hang in there, honey. Don't let her psych you out, all right?
okay, what the hell's all this?
it's a store contest. I'm the judge.
last one to let go of the dress wins the wedding of my dreams. -Of my dreams.
all right, enough. You two are injured, okay?
you need to get your priorities straight and let go of the...
let go--let go of the dress so we can treat you.
all right, let go now. Now.
that's not gonna happen.
all right. Fine. Let's move.
Oh, please let this be something good, something cardio good. Please.
33-year-old male discovered unconscious but stable having survived a 12, 000-foot free fall.
a what?
his parachute didn't open.
wait, he fell 12, 000 feet without a parachute?
thank you.
what's his name?
Rick. I'm Rick Jacobs.
he's talking?
you'd think after 12, 000 feet, he'd have at least a punctured lung.
where is he? Where are you?
Oh, my god. There you are.
how is he? How is he? Is he okay? Is he dying?
no, I'm not dying, Sally.
okay, ma'am, you need to calm down.
is this your wife?
my skydiving instructor.
well, ma'am- -I watched the whole thing.
I-I couldn't do anything. I was just--I was just in the clouds floating, watching while he--while he-- while he--you-- you fell to your death.
his chute didn't open.
ma'am, okay, we need to do our jobs, and you're making that difficult by hovering over the patient.
P-please have a seat and breathe.
I heard we have a skydiver who fell 12, 000 feet.
that'd be me.
hello. -Hi.
he's talking?
clearly he's in shock, can't feel the extent of his injuries.
let's get him down for a C. T.
Cristina, where are you going?
multiple injuries means multiple surgeries. I'm going to get me some cardio.
okay, do you see that you're bleeding all over the dress?
it's not about the dress.
I can't, uh, I can't-- there's too much blood down here.
which one of your legs is bleeding?
I don't know. I can't really feel anything anymore.
I hear you have a broken nose down here. What's with the dress?
it's not about the dress.
can't they--can't they just split the prize?
I offered. I offered that 14 hours ago.
it is a $100, 000 wedding package, and I am not splitting it with anyone.
Oh, you're bleeding on your dress.
it's not about the dress!
uh, uh, I'm gonna have to stabilize that shoulder somehow.
I'll go grab a sling.
well, this is cozy. -This is hell.
I assigned O'malley to you to keep him away from me, and now our patients are connected to each other.
you're not looking at this like the opportunity it is.
Meaning? -Meaning he's an intern.
it's, like, half my job, torturing interns.
Thanks. That's-- that's almost sweet.
but torturing George is not gonna make any of this any better.
torture him how, exactly?
my hands always get so sweaty in hospitals.
it's the weirdest thing.
it's pretty common, actually.
if it makes you feel any better, dr. Hahn has done this procedure hundreds of times.
and she's really gonna thread a catheter up my leg, all the way to my heart?
trust me, you are in excellent hands.
but, um, I--I'll be out, right?
Oh, yeah, you'll be asleep. You won't remember a thing.
ivory-billed woodpecker.
I'm sorry?
ivory-billed woodpecker-- that's what's getting me through this.
I'm a, uh, lifelong birdwatcher.
and when I get through this, I am finally going to scout the ivory-billed woodpecker.
it is so rare.
you know, we--we thought it was extinct.
but it's not.
it lives in Arkansas...
in this one little patch of swamp.
do you have any idea how incredible it is to see a bird like that in person?
I'm sorry.
uh, I'll be just one second.
why are you hovering?
guess what just came into the pit.
no, no, don't guess. I'll tell you.
Skydiver.
skydiver whose chute didn't open, who fell 12, 000 feet and landed in some shrubbery.
poor guy. He probably broke every bone in his body.
no, the point is not "poor guy. " The point is amazing surgery.
and it could be yours for the low, low price of a humdrum, everyday cardio cath.
Yeah, forget it. I'm not giving up Hahn's service.
Hey, hey, Izzie, you know what? Cardio is my thing.
no.
I like this patient, I like Hahn, and I like cardio.
no, you are-- you are flirting with cardio.
I am married to cardio.
you will marry general surgery or, you know, okay, perhaps neuro.
but you, you are nowhere near hard-core enough to commit to cardio.
so you are telling me to stop flirting with your husband.
I get it. That's cute.
but if you're gonna ask me for a favor, insulting my personal life is probably not a great tactic.
no, no, no, wait. I am not talking about your sex life.
I could not care less about your sex life.
it's a skydiver, Lzzie. Skydiver.
sounds real cool. Enjoy it.
if his intestines look like I think they will, that's gonna take first priority.
he could have delayed paralysis.
this is not a contest, gentlemen.
but since a perforated bowel could kill the guy whether or not his spine's in working order, my money's on the chief going first.
Hey, what'd I miss?
any cardiothoracic concerns? I'd be happy to page Dr. Hahn.
sc's coming up.
here it is. Wait for it.
w-wait. Wait.
Oh, that can't be right, can it?
I'm not seeing any free fluid, any intraperitoneal gases.
does anybody see anything?
there! Right there. A hematoma in the right lower quadrant.
it's the appendix.
w-we're saying this guy fell 12, 000 feet, and basically all he needs is an appendectomy?
you're charting... in a closet.
I get a lot of work done in here. It's quiet and nice.
and a closet.
look...
when I'm out there roaming the floors, okay, I am the other grey that dr. Yang likes to humiliate and kick around.
and--and in here, I'm--I'm not. You know, in--in here, I'm-- it's just
it's--it's my place, okay? It's--it's a closet.
you know, every intern class has its runt of the litter.
you keep this up, this year it's gonna be you.
get up.
Oh, sorry. You probably need to get in here.
no, grab--grab a sling from the box and come with me.
with you?
well, if you'd rather sit like a loser in a closet doing charts, you can.
or you can come help me on ortho today. Your choice.
no way. No frickin' way.
it's the only solution if neither of you will let go of the dress.
it's very simple. Dr. Torres needs to treat Jackie's shoulder and leg, so, Jackie, you need a proxy.
what?
think about it, babe. This gives you an advantage.
you get to rest your hand and come back refreshed.
give me the dress. I'll be the proxy.
no way.
this isn't fair. You think this is fair?
Dr. O'malley's the proxy.
what?
he'll hold on to the dress.
hold the dress? You just want me to stand here and hold a dress?
no one every said internship was easy.
dude, you're job kinda sucks, huh?
Hello? Watch the shoulder.
Oh, check it out. Bambi's a bridesmaid.
you're right. This did cheer me up.
you've got no lung injuries, no spinal injuries, no broken bones.
you're just a lucky man. -Holy crap.
the only thing we found was a little bleeding in your lower abdomen.
which means we have to remove your appendix.
how's that even possible?
uh, the body's an amazing thing. You know, sometimes these things, they just happen.
if you had died... god.
I didn't though. I lived.
it's just the most amazing feeling.
I feel like I could do anything right now.
I mean, anything in the world because I faced death and I survived.
it changes a person. -It does.
it so does.
Sally...Sal, I have to-- I want to, um
don't worry.
the minute-- the minute we get out of here, I am so destroying that video.
you will never have to-- to relive that horrible-- in fact, where's your helmet?
I'm gonna destroy that video right now.
wait.
did she say "video"?
the trick is to envision the artery like a spaghetti noodle-- pliable, but not too fragile.
good morning.
Oh, this is an unexpected surprise, chief. You need something?
Oh, first day. Just wanted to see how you were settling in.
you see that?
it's a blockage, left main coronary artery. It's totally closed off.
there's no way I'm getting a stent in there. We're gonna have to open him up.
B. P.'S dropping to 58 over 20.
his heart's racing.
and his temp's rising. Muscles are rigid.
all right, let's bring him off anesthesia and start him on 100% o-2.
he's got malignant hypothermia.
so he's allergic to the anaesthetic?
he'll never be able to endure the cabs.
so what are our options?
that's just, uh...
I mean, it sounds like you're telling me...
you're not actually telling me I'm... I'm gonna die?
the blockage we found in your heart needs surgery, extensive surgery. Angioplasty won't work.
and since you're allergic to the anesthesia...
so I'll just, uh...
I'll be like this.
I'll be sick and exhausted...
and like this... until one day when I'll...just, uh...die.
it would've been wonderful to see that bird.
it would've been wonderful.
you're crowding me, O'malley.
Hey, hey, I think he just let go. You just let go of the dress, didn't you?
no.
I wish to god he had.
I swear, if you let go and lose this contest after my Jackie almost died to win it - - dude, a busted shoulder does not mean she almost died. Okay?
whatever.
I'm watching you.
I know you all think this is stupid.
if I were you, I would think this is really stupid.
I've never been married myself, so I'm not one to judge, but george here knows all about what it takes.
don't you, O'malley?
you're married? For how long?
not very long.
newly we do congratulations.
Thanks.
now, Jackie, dr. Karev and I are gonna do this on the count of three, okay?
I should totally win over that Helena girl. I'm am way more injured than she is.
I should just win by default.
is it in?
it popped back out.
she's gonna need surgery.
Hey, no. I gotta get back to my dress. Just wrap some bandages around it or something.
you would rather hold on to a dress with a dislocated shoulder than let me repair it in surgery for you right now?
I can have surgery anytime. I can only win this wedding once.
so what, he just stands there and holds a dress?
I know. I thought it was gonna be more exciting, too.
a monkey could hold a dress.
actually, this is a lot harder than it looks.
don't let them get to you. Tune them out, all of them.
it's the only way to get through it.
sweetie, he's your competition. Don't help him.
you ever give morphine to people who aren't patients?
this kinda blows.
it's more fun when you heckle.
don't heckle, George.
Yeah, whatever. I got something way better than this.
something that tops O'malley playing bride?
skydiver video.
what are we doing?
video from the helmet of a skydiver without a chute.
you guys are sick.
Oh, it's not a snuff film. The guy survives.
holy...
Oh, is he...
Oh, no, he's going for it. He's going for the chute.
Oh, and it doesn't open.
now he's flailing.
he's going for his second chute.
Oh, jeez. -Oh, also doesn't open.
you'd think there'd be more screaming.
Oh, ok how close the ground is getting.
Wh-what's he doing now? -Peeing his pants.
is he saying something? Turn it up.
God, I wish would've told you. I am so in love with you.
I-I love you. I love you. I love you, Sally. I--ohh!
who's Sally?
his skydiving instructor. -Sad.
Hey, what are you even doing here? Aren't you supposed to be in surgery?
the guy is allergic to anesthesia. The surgery was canceled.
I drowned.
I was sinking...
I died.
and you know what I realized?
I realized how stupid all of my issues are.
I'm waiting for how this applies to me.
it doesn't. -Of course not.
well, that man fell, and all he wanted was one last chance to tell Sally how he felt about her.
and I got one last chance. I got my chance.
and what have I done with it?
you know, being aware of your crap and actually overcoming your crap are two very different things.
I know. -Okay, found it.
Dr. Hahn, I know how you can do the surgery on the patient who is allergic to anesthesia.
well, no anesthesia means no ventilator.
you can operate on him while he's awake.
yang-- you can use a high thoracic epidural to numb him from the chest down.
let him breathe on his own the entire time.
I mean, they pulled it off in India last month, and then again in
Dr. Hahn, you wanted to sign the discharge papers for Mr. Arnold?
not quite yet.
wide awake?
you want me to let you slice open my chest while I'm wide awake?
it is your best option.
uh, how...
how long would I have to be lying there, uh, on the table with my chest open, uh, like that?
the surgery can take up to five or six hours. Maybe more.
uh, six hours...
awake...
W-With you operating on my heart. I...
the ivory-billed woodpecker.
what? -What?
the ivory-billed woodpecker. Mr. Arnold you want to live to see it, don't you? This is your only chance.
ivory-billed woodpecker.
excellent.
Stevens, we will scrub in as soon as an O. R. is free.
uh, but the surgery was Cristina's idea.
either you want in or you don't.
which is it? -I do.
uh, but-- I'm sure there'll be standing room in the gallery, Yang.
Stevens, book the O. R.
uh, chief.
awake open-heart surgery?
I want to talk to you about tonight.
have you heard about this awake open-heart surgery?
I've invited Sloan and, um, well, I'm wondering what I should tell him to expect.
mm, tell him to expect a good time.
okay, so what is that, poker, cigars, whiskey?
I mean, what kind of things?
a good time, Shep.
you know?
you have no idea the kind of stamina it takes to stand in a display window for two days.
it's the hardest thing I've ever done, like, ever.
you're risking permanent damage to your shoulder over a contest.
what does your dress look like?
strapless, sweetheart neckline, crystal beading
so pretty.
but you're gonna wear your hair down, though, right?
you know, to cover the hunchback?
the what?
Oh, it's just, since you're ignoring dr. Torres' advice about getting the surgery, you know, your shoulder is probably gonna be pretty swollen and purple --you know, kind of like a hunchback?
but your hair should totally cover it.
I mean, probably, with the right veil.
you didn't tell me that.
how soon can we have the surgery?
Dr. Hahn.
I heard a crazy rumor about you.
that I'm performing open-heart surgery on a man who's wide awake?
that's the rumor that's the truth.
well, I perform awake brain surgery all the time.
not the same thing.
you ever heard of a gentlemen's evening?
I'm sorry?
the chief is hosting a gentlemen's evening.
we're pretty sure it doesn't involve porn, but, you know, we want to be sure.
right.
are you two a couple?
That's--no.
just checking.
why would she ask that?
I don't know.
I'm--I'm worried about this gentlemen's thing.
you got a second?
Seriously?
one second. Hi.
we're gonna have to push bac our perfect evening tonight.
not by much-- a few hours, I think.
sure.
okay.
I'm about to scrub in on an awake open-heart surgery.
a what? -Awake.
the patient's gonna be wide awake while we operate on his heart.
that is intense. -It is.
it is intense. It's...
you know, Cristina would be all over this.
she would be studying and quizzing herself, and all I can think about is--is the poor guy.
you know, he's really nervous already, and...
I'm not hard-core.
I'm not hard-core enough for this.
Yes, you are.
what, you're just-- you're just not like Cristina.
you're hard-core.
you're hard-core like Izzie.
did that just sound dirty? 'Cause that's not how I meant it.
mean it, man.
shut.
go kick ass in the surgery, and then we'll have our night, and it will be perfect.
Oh, I have not shaved my legs yet.
go be hard-core Izzie.
go. -Okay, got it. Going
thank you. -Bye.
she's hot, man.
is she your wife?
I don't know you well enough to have this conversation.
chief, you paged?
close the door.
you had the nerve to tell a patient you would perform awake open-heart surgery without running it past me?
did burke run every surgery past you?
Erica, I know you're new here... -no.
but we run-- I just want to know what the rules are.
every surgery burke booked, he ran it up the flagpole first?
and what about pretty and prettier?
they run all their surgeries past you?
wait, you're talking about Shepherd and Sloan?
I am talking about your male attendings.
you know, the ones you invited to your gentlemen's evening?
guess you don't know a guy till you work for him.
I mean, who knew you were running some kind of old boys' club?
no, that is not it.
what we were-- you realize that an evening to which the male attendings are invited and the women are not -- you realize that that's a lot like when law firms used to have country club weekends and failed to invite the black sociates?
good talk.
I gotta prep for my surgery.
remember when I was dead?
before I went in that water, everything was so complicated and hard.
and then you pulled me out of the water.
and I came back to life.
for a moment, everything was so clear...
as if the water had washed everything clean.
do you remember that?
I do.
me, too.
I don't know how you guys did this for two days.
believe me, I would be at city hall tomorrow if that were an option.
it is an option. You could just...let go.
you let go.
you let go, and it's no big deal. It's a wedding.
I let go, and I have to face the wrath of Dr. Sloan.
my mom manages a grocery store, and ever since I got engaged, she's been putting herself into serious debt over hand-engraved place cards and chocolate fountains.
it's her dream.
my wedding is her dream.
this is so important to her.
this is what she's been living for since I can remember, since my dad left.
my perfect night.
so...
I can do this.
I can do this for her...
because she's done a lot for me.
get me a crash cart right now.
must have happened when she fell this morning, which means she was bleeding all day.
she seemed just fine.
she must have been feeling some major pain.
Yeah, holding on to that dress, that wasn't easy for her.
it was humiliating. It was
but when someone's trying to break you, it gives you drive, gives you strength.
holding on to that dress for hours--I mean, days-- you know, just...
and in public, refusing to buckle, refusing to beg
that hard-core. I mean, in its own way, that's seriously hard-core.
rumor has it that Sloan was busy hazing one of his interns today.
I take it you didn't buckle.
no, sir.
good man, O'malley.
uh, I can't feel anything from the neck down.
it's almost like the rest of me just doesn't exist.
okay, the sound you're about to hear, that's the saw.
that--that's not a pretty sound.
I brought you some music.
just listen to this and tune it all out.
and--and--and that smell.
that--that smell is not--that's the cautery.
I-I know it's hard, but you'll get used to it.
in a moment or two, you won't even notice it. I promise.
he jumped out of that plane.
no one forced him to do it.
fell 12, 000 feet.
people chasing death down, then trying to cheat it.
doesn't make any kind of sense to me.
there's a clarity thing.
when you cross over the edge, there's a moment when everything...just melts away, and you're fearless.
I get it. I understand wanting to feel like that.
you're awake.
did I win?
you should know that your surgery went very well.
but who won?
I-is she still holding on?
Helena collapsed.
she's in surgery.
so--so I won?
she--she collapsed, which-- which means I won, right?
Where--where's the judge?
you--the woman that you stood next to for two days almost died.
okay, you've just woken up from surgery, and all that you can think about is if you won a stupid contest?
don't you get it?
you--you shouldn't have to fight this hard for a wedding.
you fight for a marriage, and sometimes even that is a lost cause.
sometimes you have to know when to let go.
so just let go already, all right?
just frickin' let go.
Yeah, but...
d-did I win?
Izzie stuck a picture of a bird on an empty saline bag and put it in his eyeline.
that's smart. I wouldn't have thought of that.
she doesn't let me take care of her.
it's not my job anymore.
she won't let me.
I'm taking care of her.
you're, uh...
you're, uh, you're looking at my heart?
you're looking at my actual heart?
better than that, Mr. Arnold, we're fixing it.
and, uh, all-- all those people, uh, up there in the observation deck, they're --they're, uh, looking at it, too?
they are.
people watching me.
Pe-people watching me instead of, uh...
it's--it's so weird, uh, to be the one being watched.
it--it's so weird.
how you doing there, Mr. Arnold?
you need anything?
uh, uh, it's--it's cold, uh, co-cold in here.
uh, I-I need to cover up.
uh, uh, c-cover me up.
uh, okay?
um, cov-cover me up.
c-cov-cover me up.
Yeah, we're gonna-- we're--we're gonna cover your legs with more blankets right now.
Oh, c-cov-cover me up.
okay?
okay, cov-- cover me up.
his heart rate's up to 168.
damn it.
you know, uh, ev-everybody's watching, uh, and--and, uh, I-I need to be covered up.
I-I need-- I-I can't stay like this.
I can't stay like this.
you need--need-- I-I can't I can't.
no, stop right now.
just--just stop the surgery.
stop! Stop it!
okay, I-I mean it.
get your hands out of me.
please stop!
Mr. Arnold, I need you to calm down so that your heart can calm down.
okay, hey, Mr. Arnold.
Mr. Arnold， oh.
look at me.
good. Okay.
now I want you to focus on-- on the observation deck, okay?
pretend that it's a tree line or a shoreline or something-- something with birds.
those aren't people up there watching you, those are birds-- your birds-- and you're watching them.
so tell me, Mr. Arnold, about the birds.
tell me. Tell me about the birds.
I-I can't.
you can.
how about her?
that woman in--in the far left?
what kind of bird would she be?
okay, okay, uh, uh, I guess, um, uh, she--she has a long neck.
uh, so she'd-- she'd be an ibis, s-some kind of ibis.
okay, good. Great. Great.
who's next?
uh, okay.
th-that one, uh, doing--doing that little, uh, dance with her fingers.
um, she's a...
she-- she's the purple sandpiper.
uh, yeah, th-those are tough little birds.
those are survivors.
and, um, and him, uh, with the, uh, the--the sad eyes, uh-huh, he would
he's a, uh, a-a thrush, a-a black-headed nightingale thrush.
and--and the tall one standing there, uh, watching over everything, over, uh, everyone
uh, uh, he doesn't loss a thing.
he's a...
a great blue heron.
no question.
Hey, how's, uh, how's, uh, how's your bride?
did she, uh, pull through okay?
please tell me that you let go first.
I absolutely cannot handle my bride winning that way.
what?
Oh, nothing. Just, uh...
I just didn't know if we-- we'd ever be able to talk again.
I'm letting go.
I have to...
let go.
why didn't you tell anybody you were hurting?
you would've made me let go.
hell yeah, I would've.
I guess I lost anyway.
no, actually, I let go first.
you did?
someone had to catch you.
have a nice life.
we won.
Oh, my god. I can't believe I'm crying over this.
we did this.
we actually did this.
no, sweetie, you did it.
this was all you.
I know this sounds ridiculous, but I'm a little disappointed.
I mean, I survived a 12, 000-foot freefall, and this is gonna be my only scar?
it goes away.
the scar?
the feeling.
that feeling that you have right now, today, that feeling like you can do anything, that clarity, it goes away.
and you go right back to being the coward who can't tell the person you love how you feel.
I saw your video.
y-you saw the...
but you're not gonna let Sally see it, right?
y-you're n gonna let her know what I said?
like I said...
it goes away.
it's going away right now.
you have to tell her how you feel, right now while you still can.
she is just so incredible, I mean, at everything she does.
she's way out of my league. You don't understand.
there is no way that she could possibly feel the same way that
well, if she doesn't feel the same way, then you move on.
but if you never find out how she feels, then that won't be your only scar.
he doesn't have any secret fetishes, right?
he really-- he doesn't strike me as a fetish kind of guy.
Hey, richard, you gotta tell us what this evening is about.
you've been obtuse, it's been fun but, you know, we're getting a little freaked out now.
what's a gentlemen's evening?
it's an evening with no ladies, just gentlemen.
that's it?
pretty boys living in the woods.
this is very charming.
or sad.
I'm not sure which.
what happened to no ladies?
plans change.
what are you doing tonight?
as in, uh...
what are you doing tonight?
look, uh...
I'm not a nice guy.
I don't date. I don't call the next day.
I--I'm not looking for a relationship 'cause I'm never good at 'em.
and honestly, I'm kinda hung up on somebody else. So...
the only thing you're ever gonna get from me is sex. That's it.
and, uh, that's never enough for girls like you.
deep down, everyone wants to believe they can be hard-core.
but being hard-core isn't just about being tough.
Oh, this is just unfair!
in your face, banker. Park place is mine.
give it up.
come on.
Yeah, oh, with a hotel!
I think you owe him money.
it's about acceptance.
I'm exhausted.
every bone...
and every muscle in my body...
aches.
and I don't think I can do this.
I don't-- it's not that I don't want to, because I do.
I really, really do.
it's just that I-I just spent six and a half hours on my feet in surgery, and I can barely hold myself up, and I'm just so tired.
this is--this is like a-- a rare bird, George.
you know, I mean, the first time that we're together since
since we were together, and it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
I don't want to waste it. I don't want to waste it on a night that I'm too exhausted to enjoy it because I want to enjoy our rare bird, George.
I need to enjoy our rare bird.
me, too. I...
and oh, my hand is jus oh, it's just killing me from holding that dress.
s-so maybe to-- maybe tonight's not the perfect night.
maybe a perfect night is another night.
Really?
do you want to maybe, uh...
go to sleep?
Oh, thanks.
okay.
did you only shave one of your legs?
I know. I'm sorry.
no, no, I was just wondering. It's cool.
it's-- it's okay. Sorry.
it's-- it's -- oh, my god. I can't do it.
sometimes you have to give yourself permission to not be hard-core for once.
maybe I should take a sleeping pill.
Oh, no. Don't do that.
we'll just sleep, and...you'll sleep.
I can't stop, Cristina.
I just can't stop seeing Derek.
and it's not about the sex. It's not about the sex.
it's about that moment afterward...
when the world stops.
it just feels so safe...
so safe.
I'm not ready to give that up.
does that make me sad and weak and pathetic?
a little bit.
what do I do?
I don't know.
you don't have to be tough every minute of every day.
it's okay to let down your guard.
in fact, there are moments when it's the best thing you could possibly do...
as long as you choose your moments wisely.
Alex, please tell me that you don't live with meredith grey.
Alex, please tell me that you don't live with Meredith Grey.
the more available he gets, the more I pull away.
I'm used to being number one.
I will help you. We'll be like a team.
Dr. Hahn has agreed to become our new head of cardiothoracic surgery.
lookin' forward to it, dr. Yang.
Ah, good morning.
trout for breakfast... - again.
tonight we will have hot, perfect sex.
I'm exhausted.
maybe tonight's not the perfect night.
before we were doctors, we were med students.
which meant we spent a lot of time studying chemistry.
Wow. - Yeah.
that was... - aerobic.
aerobic bad? - No, no.
why, do you think it was bad? - No.
okay. - No, I mean, obviously we both were nervous.
well, yeah, we've been, uh, you know, waiting for so long. It was like...
it better be good. - Yeah. No, better be worth it.
that's a lot of pressure. - Yeah.
let's just do it again. - Yeah, let's get right back on that horse.
organic chemistry, biochemistry...
we learned it all.
what's new with you?
I saw my half sister half naked.
what's new with you? - I had dinner and a movie...
with the chief.
hey...
you could stay.
Yeah, I think I'm gonna go.
leave you wanting more and all of that.
but when you're talking about human chemistry, only one thing matters...
either you've got it...
or you don't.
dry cleaning.
Yeah. You want some coffee?
and tell them that there is a stain on the left sleeve of the blue one.
I'm thinking "godfather" tonight.
sounds good.
I'm gonna make 'em an offer they can't refuse.
that's Brando. - Yeah. Got that.
thank god hey, I'm taking Meredith Grey from you this week.
her mother was a good surgeon, and I want to see what she's like.
well, that's not how it works here. You get assigned a resident.
there's a schedule.
well, the schedule doesn't take into account certain things.
like what? - Like the fact that I don't want Yang.
you can have Stevens.
she's good, and I'm sure Shepherd won't mind.
won't mind what?
Oh, she's sassy.
she's a woman of substance. You two have nothing in common.
Oh, I'm late. I had to drop off the chief's dry cleaning.
you're doing his laundry?
we're helping each other out.
yeah? What's he doing?
he has an extensive dvd collection.
you're dating the chief.
I don't care if you sleep with Lexie. - Oh, I just can't do it at my house.
it's my house. - Oh, get over it.
it was a onetime thing anyway. - Alex.
what? Seriously, one time.
what's the problem with you and your sister anyway?
she's not my sister.
Hey.
you look weird. - I don't look weird.
what's wrong? - I look fine.
I know you.
it's horrible... e sex...
with Izzie...
horrible it's like she's trying too hard.
It's...it's... you ever see a porno?
not that Izzie's a porno. She's an angel.
but it's like she's trying to channel a porn star.
and she's trying to act all dirty and sexy, which sounds great, right?
but in reality, I just want to say, "Izzie, just 'cause you can do that with your legs doesn't mean that you should.
I want to run. - Run. Run. Run now.
Oh!
I love George. - Oh, god.
I do. I love him.
and I'm so happy because he's kind and smart and, um, sweet and sexy.
he's perfect. Perfect.
except for the fact that he kisses like a chicken.
you know, a chicken pecking the ground for food,
I just pecking and pecking and pecking?
and when he's pecking at me like that, I forget that I love him.
I forget that he's kind and...and sweet and sexy, and I just want to scream,"stop pecking me!
did he peck you like a chicken, Mer?"
morning. - Cristina needs me.
I'm painting Burke's apartment so I can stop calling it "Burke's apartment..."
a happy color... red, like blood.
Plus, I am on cardio this whole week...
one of the benefits of living with the person who makes the schedule.
I'm on post-op again.
second week in a row.
trade with me.
Oh, yeah. No way.
I was talking to Meredith. - Why? I'm with Hahn.
dude, wake up and smell the surgical board.
3 days ago, there was a code in room 2037 and no resident to cover it.
I-I... - the schedule is a mess, your mess.
clean it up.
chief had on his stern face.
Yeah, you know, I was... I was happy this morning.
you know why?
because I have back-to-back surgeries today.
you have on your I-want-something face.
will you cover for me, just do the chief resident thing so I can stay happy?
just today. Please, please, please.
so you want me to... - be me.
but, you know, better.
be you.
how's it going, Jerry?
if by "how's it going," you're asking me if I've had the pleasure of taking a crap yet, Dr. Karev, the answer is it's not going.
nothing's going. Nothing's moving.
it's been five days since your bowel resection.
you should be... - Crapping by now?
what's the problem? Did you people botch the surgery?
is there crap leaking out into my body?
the surgery was a success... - listen, Dr. Karev... oh, mama!
I've been divorced twice. My children won't talk to me.
I've battled addictions, filed for bankruptcy.
my life has basically sucked.
but through it all, the one thing I had going for me was I crap like clockwork.
it's a simple pleasure. I want it back.
so get your little prescription pad and write me a prescription to make me crap.
grey and Hahn?
Hey, she can't do this.
she can't just not teach me. It's her job.
Torres has to make her teach me.
if the chemistry isn't there... - It's not chemistry. She doesn't like me.
she says it's chemistry.
no, I'm going to Torres.
uh, Dr. Torres...
wanted me to tell you...
to find another specialty.
W-why? - It's not gonna work with Hahn.
so you need to find a way to make it work with another specialty.
I suggest you try the E. R.
what? - This isn't a request.
this is an order from your chief resident.
the E. R.Can be a candy store.
you've got car crashes, impalements. What do you got?
sprained ankle and an infected bunion.
it can also strip you of your will to live.
okay, go, troll, find me something good.
Dr. Yang.
has Meredith said anything to you about me?
cause she's been avoiding me for days.
you know, what did I say to you about talking to me about your personal life?
help! My...my baby.
I-I was carrying her down the stairs and I fell, and she hit her head.
she was crying in the car, and now she's not crying anymore.
I'm too scared to look. Someone please tell me my baby's alive.
okay, let me have the baby... - she can't be dead, right?
you don't die from just falling down the stairs.
she's... - please, let me help. Let me help.
I'll take the baby. That's fine. Okay.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
she's breathing.
her fontanelle feels tense. She's lethargic.
take her to trauma two and page Shepherd.
thank you. - You're welcome.
thank you so much. Thank you
okay, ma'am, um, you can, uh, stop hugging me so I can take care of your baby.
ma'am.
ma'am? Ma'am?
I'm not getting a heartbeat.
no pulse.
get me a crash cart.
she's not breathing.
Dr. Yang? - Teresa Brotherton, lost vitals and coded.
I needled a tension pneumo on the right side. She regained vitals.
she's got so much air in the soft tissues, it's obscuring the ultrasound.
probably punctured an airway as well as her lung.
feel that?
uh, I was talking to Grey.
we've got it from here, Dr. Yang.
call C. T. tell them we're on our way.
and you didn't see him swallow it?
you were making your collages while our son quietly choked to death?
it's one marble.
Brian, honey, tell your dad you're not dead.
then ask your mom what the hell collage art is.
maybe if you came to my studio sometime, you could see for yourself.
okay, look, I'm too busy working to pay for that studio...
okay, mom, dad, just shut up, okay?
sorry. They're annoying.
Brian, that's rude. - I wonder where he gets that from.
well, there's not much we can do except wait for it to pass.
so he's fine? - It was one marble.
he's not choking or drooling.
he'll be fine.
but I still get something, right?
you said after we went to the hospital, I'd get whatever I wanted.
absolutely, sweetie. You were really brave.
Yeah, buddy, anything you want. - Okay.
I want you guys to get a divorce.
how about a puppy? - No, don.
what? A boy should have a puppy.
we talked about this earlier. - I know we talked about it, but look, the kid...
we'll infiltrate with a mixture of bupivacaine then lido with epi along these areas here.
is there a surgery that can make me look like her?
you're much prettier than Dr. Stevens.
then how come I can't even remember the last time I had sex?
I'll bet Dr. Stevens can remember the last time she had sex.
Harriet, don't harass the residents. - She's young. She still has her looks.
although, sweetie, you're already getting worry lines.
what do you possibly have to be worried about?
nothing. I-I don't have worry lines.
Oh, oh, your frown line is already prominent.
whatever is wrong in your life, you need to fix it quick.
because once this stuff starts to turn south, honey, it is a long way back. Trust me.
know what this is?
looks like multiple rib fractures and a massive hemothorax.
actually, it's you giving up O. R.Two.
my patient is emergent.
what do I tell my patient?
if it were me, I'd tell her to age gracefully.
your baby has a slight brain contusion.
her brain's bruised. It's minor.
but I'd like to keep her here for observation.
I-I gotta tell you, dr. Shepherd,
I'm listening to you, but I'm not hearing anything you're saying.
Dr. Hahn is taking my wife into surgery right now, and I need to go be with her.
you know what you're doing. G-go ahead and do it.
I need to go be with my wife.
wait.
um, what's your daughter's name?
she doesn't have one yet.
we just adopted her a week ago, just been trying to get to know her.
clear.
clear.
push the intracardc epi.
get ready to cross-clamp the aorta.
the heart's responding. Sinus rhythm.
all right, that's twice in two hours this woman has died.
let's pick up the pace, everyone.
the less time she's on the table, the better.
quite a rush, huh?
Hahn took my O. R.
she's pushy.
pushy and rude.
is she doing a stapled tractotomy? - Yeah.
she's trying to save as much lung tissue as possible.
doesn't make up for pushy and rude.
no, it doesn't.
you paged me?
Yeah, um, I was wondering, do you think I could pick her up?
the baby?
I mean, the father hasn't really been down here, and she's been through so much already.
that's not why you paged me.
it's not? - No.
you paged me because your legs are still shaking from the other night, and you're trying to work up the nerve to invite me to a friendly, neighborhood on call room.
actually, I paged you because I wanted to know if you could please tell meredith that I had no idea that her house was your house.
I mean, she and I w... we were making progress, and...
and now she must think that I'm a stalker.
sorry.
uh, your issues can't be my issues.
but I am here for the sex if you need it.
if I need it?
you know you need it.
have you seen dr. Torres?
she promised me a breakdown for next week's E.N.T. Conference by the end of the day.
uh, she asked me to pass it along.
must have slipped my mind. My apologies.
Oh, good. I mean...
this is good. This is...
nice work. - Thank you.
I mean, yeah.
sorry.
I'm sorry.
Oh, no, it's fine. - It's just...
sorry. - You go that way. I go...
you know, we...
we should... we should...stop for a sec.
we should just, uh, we're a little nervous and awkward.
we just have to admit that we're nervous and we're awkward.
Yeah, it's a little awkward. - Yeah.
because why? Because we're nervous.
so we just need to, you know, get over ourselves.
how?
we could pick a fantasy.
what? - You know, a fantasy.
we could pick a fantasy, any...
fantasy. Any...
I will do anything that you want me to.
anything?
that's what you wanted? - No.
I mean...
y-yes, but...
that's not what I meant.
what did you mean then? - Okay, let's just not ever talk about this again.
please?
we have chemistry, George.
I know we have it because we had the best sex I have ever had in my life.
do you remember that sex? - I do.
it's vague and it's in flashes, but I do.
I want that sex back. We can do this.
well, I want that sex back.
I think I chipped my tooth.
well, I've been trying to do what you said, but it's not working.
uh, what... what did I say?
to try another specialty.
Yeah, cristina, I have back-to-back surgeries, and I don't know what you're talking about, so...
uh, Dr. Bailey said it was your idea, but I thought maybe I could have some input... oh!
Oh...
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that.
The...yeah, my idea to... for you to try other specialties.
so can I, uh, can I scrub in with you?
you hate ortho.
no, I love ortho. But I can't observe anymore.
I need to scrub in, even if it's on ortho, which I love.
okay.
morning. - Morning.
I'm a person of substance.
plastics isn't all face-lifts. I do many...
substantial, life-changing surgeries.
Hey.
um, the stain's still there.
so next time, stand there, make sure you watch 'em mark it with the tape.
and everyone thinks it's so easy being chief's girlfriend.
if you need to talk, I'm here.
Oh, hi.
uh, I just came by to update him on the baby.
but I can, uh, come back.
listen, I had, uh...
I had no idea it was your house.
I...and...and, you know, I...I'm not the girl who sleeps around.
I'm not. It's just, you know, I...there's so much going on at home...
Hey, how is she doing?
she made it through the night.
that's a very good sign.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, well, she's strong. She'll make it.
she's not gonna let that baby grow up without a mother. Huh?
Hey, you're okay.
uh, no, don't... don't try to talk, okay?
your baby's fine.
she's feeding well. S-she's doing great.
I can get her if you'd like.
Dr. Grey, why don't you go get the baby?
you're dr. Grey, too? Are you two sisters?
no. Uh, just same last name.
I was just thinking about this crap I took in the army.
still nothing? I gave you a pretty good laxative.
not strong enough apparently.
have a seat, Dr. Karev. If I can't crap, you're going to sit here while I reminisce.
morning, Harriet.
let's get you out of bed, get you mobile.
mm, I'm in too much pain. Leave me alone.
Yep, the best thing for pain is to get you out of bed, get you movin'.
you'll feel much better. - I will feel better if you leave.
Harriet... - Stop scowling.
you can scowl later when you actually have something to scowl about...
when your ass expands and you get a double chin.
but right now, you are young. You should be having fun.
go, start enjoying your life.
you're getting uglier by the minute.
her heart stopped again.
they got it started, but look, I can't deal with her right now.
could you just take her back?
now! Could you take her away now?
uh, Dr. Torres, could I talk to you a minute?
uh, I'm in the middle of a shattered femur.
thank god for men who ride motorcycles, right, Yang?
right.
uh, there are some scheduling issues you have to deal with.
Yeah, can you handle it again? Thanks.
I need to talk to Dr. Torres.
my patient won't crap and won't stop talking about it. I'm done.
but the father's in no condition take care of her.
okay, is there a problem?
uh, just a little administrative traffic jam.
Dr. Torres has it under control.
okay, here's what's gonna happen...
take crap man and put him in the same room with lazy face-lift.
they can abuse each other.
the baby can stay another night.
now get out of here. And if anyone asks, none of this was my idea.
excuse us. Where does it hurt?
everywhere. - Didn't the marble come out?
Yeah, last night.
Oh, it really hurts. I ate some more.
you what?
you said you took the rest from his room.
I did. - Well, obviously you didn'T.
Brian, how many did you eat? - Eight.
is this what you ate?
Brian, this isn't a marble. This is a magnet.
page dr. Bailey. Tell her it's an emergency.
the magnets take the path of least ristance to get to each other.
if that means going through the wall of the intestine, then that's what they're gonna do.
Yeah, yeah. I'm looking at perfed bowel here.
he's gonna need surgery.
Dr. Bailey...
there's another one, and it's moving.
like a slow-motion gunshot.
all right, we gotta stop it before it rips through his stomach and kills him.
here we go, Jerry.
what the hell is this?
Oh, room shortage. You're gonna have to double up.
what? - Yeah. Harriet, meet Jerry.
this is absurd. - Oh, not so angry, Jerry.
it's not good for the complexion. Right, harriet?
Harriet, Jerry may be monopolizing the bathroom for a few hours, so if you need to go, I'd go now.
this is unacceptable. - I don't even think it's legal.
well, my advice would be to get yourselves discharged as quickly as possible.
see ya.
I have seven magnets in my tray.
he said he swallowed eight.
he has a hole in his diaphragm.
one could have wandered up to his chest. Forceps.
aren't you gonna repair the diaphragm?
uh, first I want to see if the magnet will find me.
you know he did this so his parents would get a divorce?
they fight all the time, so he made himself sick so they would take him seriously.
I bet they take him seriously now.
they said they'd try not to fight so much.
I am elbow deep in their 8 year old...
sounds like something a little extra effort can't fix.
you're probably right.
I am so right about so many things, it'll make your head spin.
her hands are beautiful.
I mean, surgically, the finesse.
I was in ortho all day.
there is no finesse to breaking bones.
Yeah, it's carpentry. - Carpentry.
you want finesse, you should try plastics. It's all finesse.
Yeah, no room for error when you're dealing with someone's face.
it's more than just face-lifts.
I'm a board certified E.N.T. I take out tumors.
it's also a lot of face-lifts.
but even face-lift...
I'm changing a life.
I'm holding someone's future in my hands.
holding a heart is way better.
she's good.
she's sleeping, but we can go in if you want to...
Dr. Hahn said that, uh, teresa's...
she's not in good shape.
her other lung is leaking now.
and they can't operate because her heart is too weak from all the strain.
so they're gonna see if she's gonna make it through the night and reassess in the morning.
I am so sorry.
I-I need tknow who to call just in case my wife doesn't make it.
I can't do this on my own.
I know what I'm capable of, and I-I can't raise a kid without my wife...
a kid that's not even my own blood.
the kid deserves a family.
and hey, I'm not a bad guy, and I-I see her, anshe's... she's good, you know?
She's...she's a good baby, but I'm not...
you're her father.
sh-she needs you.
she needs you now more...
you're her father. - I don't feel like her father.
I look at her, and I d... I s...
I see that she's not mine. She's just a baby.
did you do tonight?
I stayed late at work because my house is a broel.
what did you do - oh, no.
what? - Oh, dinner and a movie.
dinner and a movie? - Oh!
all right, dinner... - oh, dear.
uh, uh, I'm sorry.
I'll just, uh... okay, I'm...I'm...I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, okay?
it's a box of fun. You know?
it's just been...
too much. Too much pressure. - Yeah.
too much trying. We just gotta get back to having fun.
so it's a box of props? - It's a box of fun.
okay.
can I...
a box of fun and booze, 'cause I figure it can't hurt.
Yeah, yeah. Oh, that...
that's a... no. - You know what? Don't... don't...don't say it.
this will work. - Yeah?
we will work. We just need to take the pressure off.
we have the house to ourselves tonight. - Good.
we're gonna have a drink and we're gonna play.
we'll play. - Play...
with our box of fun.
you definitely don't want to go in there.
george and Izzie? - Yeah.
I think the chief just saw me naked.
nice.
I thought I said no having sex with her at this house?
I didn't invite her over.
Hi. - Hey.
um, alex, do you want to get a drink at joe's?
Yeah, sure.
there's no rule that says he can't have a drink with me.
actually, there is. I'm making one.
no drinking with alex, no sleeping with alex.
what exactly did I ever do to you?
get your own friends.
get your own life.
stop living in mine.
screw you.
I...I'll wait at the car.
I know that was mean, but she's everywhere.
you say she's not your sister.
you say you don't want to know her.
so why the hell do you care so much?
I don't. I don't.
I don't care.
morning. - Hey.
gotta get to work. - Yeah, yeah, me, too. Gotta go, gotta go.
all I'm saying is, the next time you have company, lock the door.
all I'm saying is, next time you come over, you should knock.
where is she? - Oh, well.
it looks like she finally got out of bed.
Oh!
Oh, my god!
we're adults. Don't look so shocked.
she always looks like that.
well, I guess he finally crapped.
what? - Even they have chemistry.
Dr. O'malley, he's...
Brian...he's really gonna be okay, right?
kids bounce back more quickly than adults, so...
we used to be really happy.
I'm sorry?
my husband and I, we really were...
before.
Brian was a colicky baby, and Don lost his job, and my mother died, and all this baggage piled up.
I'm s...I'm d... - I just keep thinking that we have to get back there.
maybe brian's right. Maybe Don and I do need a break from each other.
we haven't been happy in a long time.
she put her on a heart and lung machine in her room?
Yeah. She wasn't gonna survive another day without the surgery, and she was too unstable to transport to the O. R.
so Hahn had to bring the O. R.To her.
it's pretty genius, right? - It's genius.
Dr. Grey.
make sure her lines are clear.
the last thing we need is a kink to send her into arrest.
anybody gets so much as a bad feeling, we stop and we reassess.
she's gonna make it, right?
he said he's gonna give her baby up if she doesn't make it.
she has to make it. - okay, people...
kinda busy right now, Lex. - Road trip.
Hey.
Mr. Brotherton, we need to go now.
I will send dr. Grey out to you with periodic updates.
I promise I'm gonna do everything in my power to fix your wife.
I've got a thing for her. - You don't have a thing for her.
I do. I do. I have a thing for her.
it's gonna end badly. - You don't know that.
Yes, I do. - What do you know? You're dating the chief.
you know what? That joke's not funny anymore. It's overused.
lover's quarrel? - Oh, jeez.
we're not quarreling. It's not a quarrel.
more importantly, we're not...
if I...go through the trouble to choose a movie, he should have enough common courtesy to mention it if he makes other plans...
a phone call, a note, something.
and if he'not gonna pick up my shirts, just tell me.
I'll pick them up.
I'm perfectly capable of picking up my own shirts.
no. No, you're not.
you're not capable of picking up your shirts.
you're not capable of doing anything on your own.
if I wasn't around, you'd starve in a dirty shirt and die a lonely death.
Oh, for god sakes.
you know, I offered you a place to put your trailer, and you've been taking advantage ever since.
you can't handle picking up the dry cleaning or doing the cooking, so I have to pick up all the slack.
hold that thought.
you see? He can't handle the truth.
I definitely have a thing for her.
Miranda, do you have any idea why the Brothertons' baby's still here?
I believe Dr. Torres decided to keep the baby here for another day.
well, why would she do that if Dr. Shepherd was ready to discharge her?
I don't know. You'd have to ask Dr. Torres.
I mean, if it was me and the mother kept coding,
I might keep the baby around so they could get a little more time together.
and why did Torres have Stevens and Karev put their patients in the same room?
that's a clear violation of protocol.
uh, you'd have to ask her.
but those two patients were impossible, and neither one was willing to follow post-op instruction, so...
I mean, if it was me, I would put them both in the same room so they could encourage each other to get out of here.
and she told Dr. Yang to find a new specialty?
that's a pretty odd thing to say to someone who has such an affinity to cardio.
again, you'll have to ask Torres.
but maybe it has to do with the fact that Erica Hahn's putting her through her paces, so Yang needs to see what else is out there, otherwise she won't fight hard enough to stay with cardio.
I'm just guessing. You need to ask Torres.
that's just what I'm gonna do.
okay, it's been an hour. We should've heard something.
well, the fact that we haven't heard anything is good.
that means that they've got her in the O. R.
and they've opened her up.
you know, every step of this that she survives is good.
Oh, god.
so we were able to find one puncture in her remaining lung.
we're preparing to place a patch over it.
and hopefully at's the only leak, and hopefully the patch will hold.
I should be getting back.
you know, you said your wife bonded instantly with the baby.
for some people, it's like that.
for other people, they need a little more time with a baby before they can feel like a family.
I bet you know her better than you think you do.
all I know is that she cries.
okay? And she eats a lot.
we were going through formula like crazy.
and she sleeps with her hand up under her chin.
and she likes my wife.
Teresa soothes her, you know?
she puts her hand on her back...
she lets her suck on her finger.
but that's all I know.
that's five things no one else knows.
that's five things.
the patch is secure.
water, please.
all right. Let's see if I earned my paycheck today.
go to manual. Give me a breath.
no bubbles. - So far, so good. Another breath.
I see bubbles.
patch is secure. Clamp.
Oh, we got another leak.
Grey, hold on to this clamp, please.
Dr. Torres, you got a moment?
uh, don't, actually, because I have two more surgeries today.
but I know the schedule's been a little crazy.
I'll get on it tonight. - No, you're not, actually.
okay, you're right.
it may not happen till tomorrow, but, uh... - you're not gonna get on it at all.
Mr. Brotherton, we did everything we could, but...l?
Hey. - Hey.
cool lounge.
Yeah, no interns allowed.
I know that.
um, I was looking for you because I was wondering if...
if you would meet me later...
in the on call room.
I can't.
Oh, I... I thought you said that... - yeah, I know what I said, but I can'T.
because of meredith. - Look...
I'm not getting involved in whatever you two got going on.
I'm not choosing sides.
Except...clearly you are.
Dr. Bailey...
you've been covering for Dr. Torres.
chief, I... I've just been shuffling a little paperwork for her.
you've been doing the lion's share of the chief resident's work...
all the responsibility and none of the credit.
you deserve the credit.
you deserve the job.
I should've given it to you in the first place.
I hope you'll take it now.
because what you do and how you do it makes this hospital work.
well, it's about time you noticed.
can I pick her up?
Yeah, of course. Nurse.
it's okay.
I remembered a sixth thing.
she hates the car seat...
u-unless you put this little duck up under her head. You know?
Hey.
I'm gonna name you Keisha, okay?
cause that's what your mommy wanted to name you.
I am not stalking. I just...
I hate apples. Hate them.
think they shouldn't be allowed to be a fruit. That's one.
and...and two, I can draw really, really well on an etch a sketch.
like, really well, like, I could be a professional if, you know, that profession existed.
I play the trombone...badly.
uh, I like math.
and I notice that you do this thing with your hands when you're trying to make a point, like...like...like this, with your hands.
and I know that that's about you, but I... I do it, too, so it's also about me.
and so that's five...
five things that I'm hoping will make it a little bit harder for you to hate me.
I told her i could draw with an etch a sketch.
of all the things I could've chosen, I...
no wonder she thinks I'm pathetic.
I saw your transplant today. - I know.
you have extraordinary technique. - I know.
can I buy you a drink?
I have, uh, rather extraordinary techniques myself.
you're not attracted to me.
you think you are, but you're not.
you're attracted to my skill and my confidence and maybe how hot I look with my hands on a heart.
but mostly, you're attracted to me because I'm not attracted to you.
I told her I couldn't see her anymore.
you did?
whatever. I don't need another chick with issues.
thank you.
will you take my sister home?
come on, she plays the trombone and whatever.
just take her home, please.
I finished painting.
I got fired.
I married Adele two years out of college.
there's a lot I need to learn to do for myself.
just pick up your own shirts from now on.
taxi driver?
Meredith is coming over.
better get back to my trailer.
you talkin' to me?
de Niro?
Alex, I'm...I'm fine. Thank you.
um, really, you can...you can go.
what a pleasant surprise.
it's Dr. Karev, isn't it? - Yes, sir.
all right, well, don't want to interrupt you two.
wait, dad, you're going out? - Just down to the store.
dad. - It's just down to the store, Lexie.
uh, why don't I go? - You know, my car, it's right here.
I'm fine.
what do you need, scotch, vodka, gin?
scotch.
uh...
just...
don't tell Meredith.
what did you do tonight? - Nothing.
you? - Nothing.
it's late. Shouldn't you be going soon?
I just want to lie here for a few more minutes.
That...was amazing.
finally. - See?
that was as good as the first time.
no, it was better.
way better. - Way, right.
because, well, we weren't drunk, and well, I'm not married. and...
that was just... - incredible.
you're lying.
well, so are you.
chemistry...
either you've got it...
or you don't.
there's nothing sexual between you and georgie?
mom!
don't you dare come to me for forgiveness, you traitorous bitch.
our marriage is falling apart.
you're never here.
Dr. Hahn-- I have a thing for her.
it's gonna end badly.
you know what? Cardio is my thing.
you are flirting with cardio.
I am married to cardio.
Yeah, but what if, while I'm waiting,
I meet someone who is ready to give me what I want from you?
are we friends yet?
I'm sorry? -Are we friends?
I don't want you to date other people.
I don't want you to date anybody but me.
in the beginning, god created the heaven and the earth.
at least, that's what they say.
he created the birds of the air and the beasts of the field, and he looked at his creation and he saw that it was good.
and then god created man, and it's been downhill ever since.
the woman loves me.
I'm telling you.
we went out last night, had a couple drinks.
you and Erica?
just me and Hahn.
and Callie.
Oh, all right. So it wasn't a date.
why does it always have to be about the destination?
why can't it be about the journey?
cause I'm wearing $300 shoes.
Meredith told me she doesn't want me seeing other people.
she found out about you and rose?
no. There's nothing to find out. It was just a kiss.
Yeah, but you're not the kind of guy who makes out with nurses in scrub rooms.
not that there's anything wrong with that.
what do you think?
I think it was more than just a kiss.
no, no, no, no, the view.
well, what am I looking at?
the view from my new house.
the story goes on to say that god created man in his own image, but there's not much proof of that.
after all, god made the sun and the moon and the stars, and all man makes is trouble...
it's a classic victorian design with an open floor plan.
what are you doing?
I'm making an omelet.
what do you think of the house?
the house. I think the house is great.
well, if you don't like, you know, you can tell me. It's your house, too.
damn.
so why are you cooking again?
Lexie, uh, was having a bad night,
and I thought I would do something semi-sisterly
Really?
really.
are you getting up?
no.
maybe.
I don't know.
what's that smell?
someone's cooking.
that's not cooking.
that...
that's not cooking.
you're gonna be late. You know that, right?
I hate work.
since when? -Since I hate it.
I hate cristina. I hate hahn. I hate it.
Oh, what is that smell?
that smells like sulfur.
breakfast.
Oh, it's breakfast.
No!
don't go. Don't go. -I have to go.
she made breakfast. I'm going.
now stop. off.
Where's your girlfriend?
back with her husband, I'm guessing.
and I don't have a girlfriend.
or a conscience, apparently.
Yeah, but you knew that going in.
I'm not saying we have to build it now, but we have to plan it now.
dude, what the hell is that?
Meredith cooked.
she wanted to do something ce for lexie.
you cooked for me?
it's no big deal.
just eggs and avocado and whatever cheese that was in the fridge.
Oh, I love, um, avocados.
is it okay?
okay, honey.
okay.
this little man has been fed and changed.
there we go.
Oh, I put the ilding manager's number on my desk.
do not believe him when he tells you that he can fix the sink.
remind him he is the one that broke it when he tried to fix the pipes.
Oh, oh, you're talking to me now?
now that I'm my way out the door?
you're always on your way out the door. -Tucker
no, are you interested in being a part of this family or not? Because
okay, I can't do this, uh, now.
I don't have time.
Oh, Dr. Toes.
Dr. Hahn, anyone who can outdrink me and still kick my ass at the dartboard gets to call me callie.
last night was actually fun, wasn't it?
and I'm not a group person.
mm, me neither.
I think it's because I generally don't like people.
me neither.
morning, ladies.
case in point.
what's so funny?
and when man finds himself in trouble, which is most of the time, he turns to something bigger than himself
to love or fate or religion-- to make sense of it all.
sweet tart?
do you ever eat anything that even remotely resembles real food?
you'll have to take me to dinner to find out.
I can't do that.
that, uh, kiss was...
unexpected.
I like kissing you.
I enjoyed kissing you, but, uh, I'm seeing somebody.
everybody knows about you and Meredith Grey.
I have to see it through. I'm sorry.
don't be.
it was just a kiss.
see you in surgery, Dr. Shepherd.
but for a surgeon, the only thing that makes any kind of sense is...
medicine.
Yes.
Oh, I--back off.
Elizabeth Archer is my patient.
technically, she's Hahn's patient, but whatever.
um, I'm scrubbing in on a major coronary artery dissection with Hahn, and what, you're not gonna fight me for it?
I'm not doing the cardio thing anymore.
I am over it.
you're over it?
uh, why? What do you have?
nothing. I'm charting.
Stevens, Elizabeth Archer's chart.
yang has it. You two have fun.
she's not a cardiothoracic surgeon, but I could've told you that.
I am the rock star.
Karev, are you a rock star?
always.
you're with me today.
Congratulations. Your life just got more interesting.
Karev doesn't know anything about Elizabeth Archer.
you can read, can't you, Dr. Karev?
uh, yes.
Elizabeth Archer, 49, came into the E. R.Yesterday complaining of severe, persistent
an urgent cardiac cath demonstrated dissection of the proximal two-thirds of the L.A.D.
she was admitted last night for observation.
while I admire your preparation, Dr. Yang, there is one thing about the patient you failed to notice.
she's gone.
Mrs. O'malley, hi.
how have you been?
well, I've been worried is how I've been.
I--I've called, and I left messages.
I know how busy u two are, but you can't pick up the phone once in a while?
I...I 【-- never mind.
water under the bridge.
I was in the neighborhood, and I hope you don't mind, but I just couldn't wait to show you some of the outfits I've been making.
Out-outfits?
now don't get mad, but georgie told me you were trying, so...
what do you think?
it's yellow.
I see that.
Dr. Bailey.
whatever it is, I don't have time.
um, I think I need some epinephrine.
Tucker, now's not a good time for--epinephrine?
uh, the cart's around the corner. Can you give her the...
thank you.
no, I told you, I put it on my desk.
uh, I have to call you back.
you're gonna have to step back from the patient, ma'am.
ma'am?
just one second.
ms. Archer? Uh, what is she doing here?
I have no idea. Who is she?
she's Hahn's patient. Ms. Archer, uh, you need to get back to your bed.
there.
What'd you do to him? He was in v-tach and now...
I-I healed him.
I'm a healer.
you're a faith healer?
I'm a healer, and I have faith, but I'm not sure the two are reted.
ms. Archer, you collapsed.
you could go into cardiac arrest at any moment.
so I'm less interested in what you do for a living than I am with getting you into
well, wait. I want to know what she did to Mr. Greenwald.
I mean, he's been in and out of v-tach all day, and now he's stable.
maybe because of the amiodarone he got two hours ago.
Really?
does amiodarone usually take two hours to kick in?
ms. Archer, you have a coronary artery dissection.
Dr. Karev and I need to get you into surgery as soon as possible.
I appreciate that, Dr. Hahn, but I am not going into surgery until we've exhausted all the other possibilities.
ms. Archer, if you don't have the surgery soon,
I can guarantee you that the blood supply to your heart will be cut off, and I'll have to open you up anyway.
all I'm asking for is that you give me some time and talk me through the surgery that you'd like to perform so that I may visualize it while I do what I do.
and if it doesn't work, then you can slice me open, okay?
Dr. Karev can work with you doing whatever it is that you do.
I'll check in soon.
call me when she codes.
Hey, what are you looking for?
epinephrine. I need epinephrine.
Why?
Oh, what happened to you?
I'm an adult child of an alcoholic is what happened to me.
I have boundary issues.
so when Meredith made me eggs this morning, I couldn't not eat them.
I had to pretend I wasn't allergic to eggs.
and now I have a rash covering my entire body.
give me your arm.
I'm codependent, my throat is closing up--.
and now my arm hurts thanks.
you're welcome.
and thank you for leing me crash on your couch last night.
you didn't tell your mom that we broke up?
what?
your mom is making us baby clothes because she thinks we're still trying to get pregnant, because she thinks we're still married, because she thinks you're still the kind of person who would never cheat on his wife.
hand -stitched unisex baby clothes.
they're yellow and green and go up to toddler sizes.
and she's waiting for you in the lobby.
so you never really told me what you thought of the house.
I have a house.
well, that's your house. I'm talking about our house.
between yesterday and today u had plans drawn up?
no, I've had the plans for months.
between yesterday and today, i decided to share them with you.
Why?
so nothing's really changed, has it?
everything's the same as it was.
no, it's just--it's really a lot, and it's fast.
right. Well, I'm just trying to take a step forward.
okay, well, there are about 100 steps between where we are right now and building our dream house.
and they'll be fun steps and sexy steps, and we'll try not to fall down them together. Okay?
okay.
Dr. Bailey.
Yeah, rumor has it Dr. Hahn has a patient who's wandering the halls?
Oh, she's back in her bed, sir.
and laying hands on other patients?
it was just one patient.
and healing them?
for which there is a perfectly reasonable medical explanation.
of course there is, but I can't have a hospital full of sick people thinking there's a miracle woman on the cardiac ward.
creates panic and hysteria, and frankly, it's bad for business.
are you gonna answer that?
no, sir, I'm not.
are you gonna make sure this woman keeps her hands to herself?
ye sir, I am.
thank you, Dr. Bailey.
Dr. Sloan, why are you endangering the life of my patient?
because your patient had her hands all over one of my patients.
she had a staph infection. I was trying to heal her.
don't worry your pretty little head about it, Sloan. Karev.
have you noticed that even when you're insulting me, you manage to tell me how pretty I am?
it wasn't meant as a compliment.
is this like a gender reversal thing with you, where you're the big man on campus and I'm the hot blond whose ponytail you can't stop pulling?
why don't you get that I just don't like you, that I think you are a crass, predatory ape of man who just happens to be a decent surgeon?
you want to heal someone?
heal her.
this is really toxic in here. Could somebody take me back to my room?
cause my healing team should be arriving soon.
I'll take you.
Mrs. O'malley.
there she is.
come here.
what are you doing here? Does george know you're here?
Callie said she'd find him for me.
how are you, dear?
you okay?
you talked to Callie? -Poor thing.
it's gotta be hard for her, you know?
I mean, you try and you try, but we're all human.
nobody's perfect.
and in the end, it's nobody's fault.
I'm so happy to hear you say that.
I have just felt so terrible about it.
Oh, I know. Me, too.
you know, we just...
we didn't mean for it to happen.
I know how that sounds, but it's true.
we were...
we were drunk, and it only happened the one time.
and I know that doesn't mean it right.
but you have to believe me, it was never my intention to break up george's marriage.
I-I mean, I didn't even know that I was in love with him.
and george was so distraught about it.
I mean, I think that's why he failed the intern test.
he wh-what? He failed?
Oh, no. He didn't tell you that part?
he didn't tell me any part.
but you said you-- you talked to Callie.
about baby clothes.
I thought she was having trouble getting pregnant.
I made baby clothes.
Oh, no.
mom.
what?
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Hey, I- I know I said I'd call you right back...
Tucker, wait, I can't do this right now. I'm being paged to the E. R.
what do you mean, you're the one paging me?
I-I told you never to page me at the hospital unless...
there was an accident.
all four limbs are moving.
pupils are responsive and dilating.
there's no neurological damage.
let's get him on a monitor and where's the x-ray for the auma series?
order a left forearm with the x-rays.
there's bruising and swelling here.
mama's right here. Little man. I'm right here.
he was under a bookshelf?
the whole thing must have fallen over on top of him.
and all those medical books-- he probably tried to climb up and pulled it over.
I heard him screaming, and then I found him.
Tucker, I'm trying to hear. Stop talking.
Miranda, let me do that.
no, no, I got it. I got it.
Miranda. -What?
I- I...
this is why we put the baby gate in the living room.
the gate was open.
you left the gate open?
no, I didn't.
what are you trying to say, I left the gate open?
accidents happen.
not if you take the time to bolt the bookshelves to the wall.
I can't baby-proof every inch of that apartment and watch him at the same time.
well, you weren't watching him, otherwise we wouldn't be here right now.
okay, he's got decreased breath sounds on the left side, and his abdomen's rigid.
what does all this mean?
it means there may be some internal injuries.
what kind of injuries?
Tucker, we don't have time for questions.
he needs a full trauma workup.
clear a C. T. And get me an ultrasound machine.
this is not okay, georgie. This is not okay.
I- I-- you're planning to what?
you're planning to marry Izzie now? You're planning an annulment?
okay, this-- this is not about Izzie.
what the hell is it about? Because this isn't okay.
this isn't okay with me. I raised you better than this.
this is about the fact that I never should've gotten married in the first place.
but you did. You got married. You didn't invite me.
you didn't let me plan a wedding, and I accepted that.
I accepted it because you were happy, and that's all that mattered, but this-- I won't accept this. I don't accept this.
mom. -We're catholic.
we don't believe in divorce. And we certainly don't believe in adultery.
I'm sorry.
well, don't be sorry to me. Be sorry to father mike.
you call him, he'll hear your confession and he'll get you and Callie into counseling.
it's too late for that. - It is not too late.
you made a vow to Callie and a vow to god.
you just don't walk away from that.
this is your soul we're talking about.
I have to go.
no, you will not.
you will not walk away from me, George O'malley.
it's Dr. Bailey.
I have to go.
what happened?
he got crushed under a bookshelf. - Multiple rib fractures.
might have dropped a lung.
they're worried there may be damage to the heart.
okay, Yang and Stevens, get him to radiology for a head, chest and abdominal C. T.
O'malley, tell the lab to move fast.
Karev, clear out. We'll keep you posted.
I want you to stay with Dr. Bailey.
she's pretty worked up, and I want to make sure that doesn't get in the way of the baby's care.
I don't need a babysitter.
I know you don't.
you stay with her.
I'm sorry about that.
uh, there was an emergency.
Dr. Karev, this is don and mai.
nice to meet you.
he's a skeptic. He shouldn't be here.
is Dr. Hahn coming?
Dr. Hahn's been called into an emergency surgery, so she asked me to talk you through the procedure.
is she gonna be long?
well, I'm hoping she's done before your heart blows, but I can't make any promises.
I told you he shouldn't be here.
I need someone who knows what they're doing to talk me through the surgery.
this...
this, it's-- it's crap.
you're stalling. You're-- you're scared.
of course I'm scared.
surgery is...
it's barbaric.
you tear flesh and spill blood.
I-I work with light. I work with energy.
I visualize healing.
and if there's even the slightest chance that what I do works, isn't that preferable?
I don't believe in what you do.
well, I'm not asking you to.
I'm asking you to help me to do it.
can you imagine how horrible this is for her?
this is why people should not have kids.
what is the matter with you? That's Bailey's baby in there.
no, see, no. It's a trauma case.
if we are gonna be at all effective in saving that kid's life, it can't be Bailey's baby. He's a blunt trauma case.
you and Hahn are exactly alike. The two of you deserve each other.
thank you.
I thought you loved cardio. -Oh, no, no, no, no.
she's pretending not to anymore.
can't take the pressure, huh, Iz?
you're right, Cristina.
in the contest to see who can be the best robot, you win.
tell me again how this happened.
you didn't understand me the first time?
just-- just tell me again.
somebody left the baby gate open.
somebody.
and you...
you're--you're saying you think I did this?
I'm saying that you were in such a hurry to get out the house this morning, that you were in such a hurry to--to get to work and get away from me
Oh, Tucker, this doesn't have anything to do with
why do you think he even went into that room, huh?
you the only one ever goes in there.
he went looking for his mama.
he went looking for his mama and wound up in the hospital.
guess you made a bad choice, huh, tucker?
you picked a bad wife, she made a bad mother, she made you stay home, raise your son, and then she almost killed him.
poor you, huh?
I heard about Dr. Bailey's son. How bad is it?
well, we're still waiting on his studies.
remember before when I was unbelievably cool and let you off e hook for making out with me?
well, now I'm angry. - Why?
because you're not making eye contact with me.
because we are standing here talking about bailey's baby, and you won't look at me.
sorry. - Better.
now it was one kiss, okay?
it was a good kiss, maybe even a great one, but are we going to let one maybe-great kiss get in the way of what, up until now, has been a really great professional relationship even though you didn't know my name until recently?
no, we are not.
so...
friends?
friends.
good.
Bailey wants to know if Tuck's films are ready.
What...is that? What's that shadow? Where's his heart?
you can't see it because- - his stomach's in his chest.
there's visceral herniation, a positive collar sign.
which indicates a diaphragmatic hernia.
it's a ruptured diaphragm, which is the least of his problems, cause the force of the trauma injured his thoracic aorta.
you see this, in the chest cavity next to the stomach?
that's colon.
and around the colon is fluid, which could mean the colon is ruptured and there's fecal matter floating around that could infect the aortic repair, and that complication can be fatal.
what are y'all standing around for?
uh, page Hahn and the chief. Book an O. R.
okay, they repaired the hole in the diaphragm, and Dr. Hahn is just about to inspect the mediastinum.
okay, is she gonna repair with sutures or prosthetic graft?
don't know. - Don't know?
she didn't say.
Dr. Bailey.
Dr. Bailey, are you kidding?
I need to be with my son.
Miranda- - I have no intention of getting in the way.
I just--I can't stand out there. I can't.
I need to be with my son.
and what we need, Dr. Bailey, is to not have our patient's mother watching us perform his surgery.
Dr. Grey, please escort Dr. Bailey back outside.
no. There will be no escorting of ...
Bailey anywhere, Dr. Grey.
you can proceed.
I will not proceed until you leave this O. R.
now do you want me to stand here talking to you, or do you want me to try and save your baby's life?
I just want to hold my son's hand.
I just want to hold his hand. Please.
I'll--I'll hold his hand.
Dr. Grey can hold this retractor, right?
Yes.
I'll hold tuck's hand, Dr. Bailey, if it's-- if it's okay with you.
I'll hold-- I'll hold his hand.
okay, everybody, let's get back to work.
Mrs. O'malley. What are you
I- I couldn't leave.
when Harold was here, when he was sick, Dr. Bailey took such good d care of him.
I couldn't leave knowing her son was in trouble, knowing both our sons are in trouble.
Mrs. O'malley, I just
I know you think m old-fashioned, and maybe I am.
but it doesn't matter what I think.
in god's eyes, marriage is forever.
well, if it's any consolation, george and I got married on the vegas strip at a 24-hour church of elvis.
I'm not sure god was even there.
he's everywhere.
I used to believe in god...and marriage...and heaven and hell.
but you don't anymore?
I believe in love...
and second chances...
and that even though george wasn't the one for me, it was okay that I believed that he was because...
well, for a little while, at least...
I got to be an O'malley.
and I really loved being an O'malley.
he's back.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but your, uh, most recent echo shows the dissection is extending.
you need to let me prep you for surgery.
Oh, no. No, not yet. We haven't finished our work.
you're gonna die.
do you know how mai knew you were back, even with her eyes closed?
uh, she heard me?
she felt you.
it's like a-- like a pull, like a darkness.
right, right. I'm-- I'm the angel of death. Got it.
no. You're not the angel of death, Dr. Karev.
you're-- you're actually a very sweet boy.
he's got a beautiful heart, wouldn't you say, mai?
I would, but his gut and his throat...
they're blocked.
second chakra's worse.
Seriously? You're talking about chakra?
we're talking about how you've got a darkness at your throat chakra, where your voice should be because what ever happened to you was so, so ugly and went on for so long that you don't talk about it.
you were hurt so badly that sometimes you want to hurt other people just to - - just to spread it around.
you were a good boy, Dr. Karev, a good, sweet boy, but you're not a very good man.
what happened to you?
your artery is shredding.
you need surgery.
I'm not a very good man, but I do tell the truth.
and the truth is, if you don't get this surgery fast, you're gonna die.
... I left it on the desk.
I was in a hurry, so I looked at the clock and I walked out of the door.
I...the gate. - Miranda, this isn't helping.
the gate was open. Did I close the gate?
okay, look, I walked out of the bedroom into the office, and I wrote a note -- this isn't-- this isn't helping.
I can't remember. - Stop this. This is not helping.
I can't remember if I closed that gate.
that's my baby, that's my baby, and I can't remember if closed the gate.
it doesn't matter. It does not matter. - It does matter!
it matters because I'm his mother, and I can't have done this to him.
I can't have hurt him this badly.
you didn't do this. - Things just happen.
no, they don't just happen.
things don't just happen.
people make decisions.
people prioritize.
okay, the world just doesn't happen!
okay, it's not on god.
it's on me or it's on tucker!
stop it! Stop. Stop.
it's on me! - No, stop it.
just...just stop it.
you're a good mother.
Tucker is a good father.
you love your baby.
people make mistakes.
you didn't do this to your son, and neither did your husband.
he wants to build us a house, with kids' bedrooms and french doors, and that scares me to death.
Why? Just 'cause of the rose thing?
well, that shouldn't scare you. It was just one kiss.
one kiss?
Yeah, I w--I wasn't eavesdropping.
it wasn't like they were being secretive about it.
it was just something that happened.
now that you guys are back together, it's not happening anymore, so...
Derek kissed Rose?
Yeah, but you knew tha.
that I'm an idiot.
okay, the stomach's repaired.
there's no splenic laceration.
now all I have to do is get the chest tube in, and we're done.
that's good, tuck.
that means you're in better shape than we thought.
that means you're almost outta here.
Dr. Yang, would you like to do the honors?
I can trade places with you if you'd like.
uh, no. I'm okay. I'm okay here.
both of which we repaired, so the surgery was a success.
however, there is a lot of fluid in the chest cavity, so at this point, we have no way of knowing whether he'll be able to breathe on his own anytime soon.
I know that.
you don't think I know that?
uh, we'll be moving him to the pediatric I. C.U.
we'll be watching him closely.
can I see my son now?
Absolutely.
uh, you're new here.
you don't know me.
and if what you did today ends up saving my son's life, I'll thank you for it.
but if I never have to look at you again after that, that'll be all right with me.
we never baptized him.
we kept putting it off, thinking we were gonna find time, and-- and now...
we will find the time.
when this is over and tuck is fine...
you and I are gonna find time, and we are gonna baptize our baby.
how's tuck?
Oh, he's still not breathing on his own.
you know, I wish I could help, but I can't think of anything I can do.
Cristina always knows what to do.
what's your deal with her? With yang?
nothing. There's no deal. I don't...
I'm crippled with envy.
of yang?
cause she's better at cardio than you?
she's not better than me.
she just...
she knows what she wants.
she has this faith in her skill, in herself, in her future in cardio.
it's an unwavering faith.
she knows who she is, and I want that.
I was chasing cardio because I want what she has.
she's a robot.
not the robot part.
the--the faith part.
I want that.
there's probably a thousand scientific reasons why Mr. Greenwald's heart rate just suddenly stabilized.
without question.
and why Mrs. Mccaffrey's staph infection just suddenly disappeared.
Sloan's patient? She's fine?
I mean, don't get me wrong, I have faith. I do.
but faith isn't medicine.
Faith...can't heal you.
well, that may be so.
but then again...
it can't hurt.
Hey. - hey!
how's tuck?
he's intubated, and, uh, we won't know anything for a few hours.
how are you holding up?
who's rose?
rose is a circulating nurse.
I kissed her once. I'm sure you know that.
that's why you're asking me.
when? - When?
when did you kiss her? - Yesterday. Now are we gonna talk
so yesterday you were making out with scrub nurses, and today you're building our dream house.
yesterday we were dating other people.
that's not the point. - That is the point.
I told you I wanted to marry you...
that I wanted to build a house and a life with you, and you weren't ready.
and rose is?
you don't want to build a life with me.
you want someone.
you want someone who wants the same things that you want.
I knew the minute I showed you those plans that you'd find some reason to walk away.
so what, you called my bluff?
I did because I can't do this anymore.
I can't do the fighting, the back and forth. I can't.
are we together or are we not?
we were together.
I was in love with you.
you didn't tell me you were married.
okay, so now we're gonna have that fight again.
you didn't tell me about your nurse.
you want to know why I'm not ready to build a house with you?
this is why. Because I cannot trust you.
you can't trust anybody.
and no matter what I do...
you're always gonna look for reasons not to trust me.
I can't do it anymore.
I c-- I can'T.
well, neither can I.
I need you to hold hands.
Why?
because the energy in here, it's...it's not healing.
so I need you to hold hands and focus all of your love on this child.
for a few minutes, I want you to try to forgive each other.
can you try to do that?
it's not for you.
it's for little tuck.
is he better?
we don't know yet.
I know I haven't called you in a while and that there's a lot that I haven't told you, and I know I messed up.
but I didn't want to cause you any more pain, and I didn't want to disappoint you.
you disappointed yourself, georgie.
you should be disappointed in yourself.
I am.
I don't even recognize myself anymore.
this isn't the guy that I wanted to be.
who do you want to be?
the guy Bailey named her baby after.
I want to be that guy again.
you won't go to counseling?
that's just gonna hurt everyone more.
I miss your dad.
me, too.
move back home. I'll take care of you.
well, I think it's time that I start-- start taking care of myself.
Hey, uh, it-- it doesn't help me to have you all clustered here, watching.
it just doesn't help me.
I appreciate that you're, uh, that you care, that you're concerned, but I don't need to be watched.
Miranda, he's choking.
he's chok
Oh, thank god.
what are you-- what are you talking about?
no, it's good. It's good.
he's fighting the tube. It means he can breathe on his own.
I need your help.
Hahn said you'd have a heart attack this afternoon, and, uh, you didn't.
so you think there might be something to this healing thing after all?
no, but, uh, I'm gonna help you anyway.
or, uh, she is.
uh, this is Dr. Steven - hello. - Hi.
I'm sorry. I'm-- I'm not sure what I'm doing here.
Oh, you're gonna talk her through a coronary artery dissection repair.
she's an expert?
no, no, no. She's a second-year resident like me.
but she's been focused on, uh, cardiothoracics for a while, and she's seen the procedure done.
well, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but
uh, she's, uh, she's like a bright yellow, right?
what?
what I'm saying is she's an optimist.
she's the opposite of me.
she's exactly the kind of person you want helping you, right?
she brightens you, that's for sure.
shut up.
what are we talking about?
just talk her through the surgery before she croaks, all right?
can you do that?
um, you want me to talk you through it?
uh, in as much detail as possible, yes.
okay, uh...
yang's got nothing on you.
okay, there are four chambers in your heart, and there are three major coronary arteries that supply blood and oxygen...
as doctors, we know more about the human body now than at any other point in our hisry.
they extubated him.
his blood pressure's up, too.
good.
did you know that his middle name is george?
Tuck's? - After me.
I thought Dr. Bailey didn't like interns.
Oh, no.
Yeah, she doesn't.
d-- did you find an apartment yet?
because I was thinking of...
I was thinking maybe I'm gonna get one, and...
but the miracle of life itself-- why people live and die, why they hurt or get hurt-- is still a mystery.
here's the thing...
you're too pretty. - Oh, come on.
no, so pretty, in fact, that if we didn't work together, we would probably be...
but the point is we do work together.
and in order for me to do my job,
I need to leave who I am outside the doors of this hospital. So...
Oh, hey. You ready?
I am.
where you guys going? You going to Joe's?
I'll come meet you.
good night, Dr. Sloan.
we want to know the reason, the secret, the answer at the back of the book...
do you want to go to dinner with me tonight?
I thought you weren't free.
turns out I am.
and I'd like to go out with you tonight.
do you want to go out with me?
that'd be nice.
because the thought of our being all alone down here is just too much for us to bear.
how's he doing?
he's gonna be just fine.
Where's your husband?
uh, he went home to get some sleep...
and to pack his things 'cause he's getting himself a hotel room tonight.
I'm sorry.
for some reason, life just seems to make a lot more sense when you're looking at a baby.
but at the end of the day...
the fact that we show up for each other, in spite of our differences, no matter what we believe, is reason enough...to keep believing.
the surgical training protocol is officially changing, people.
you thought that you'd defend your boyfend to me, and I'd just take it?
he's not my boyfriend.
Hi. - Hi.
you and Derek will not work.
why do you care what I think?
if I'm gonna do this with him, I need you to cheer me on.
as surgeons, we are trained to fix what's broken.
I'm in a hurry.
I can't stay.
the chief's having a big meeting.
uh, but I wanted to tell you that I'm finished with therapy.
the breaking point is our starting line...at work.
Meredith, you are not finished.
you have worked incredibly hard.
look how far you've come. But you're just scratching the surface.
well, Derek's moved in, and we've taken it to the next level.
it's not about Derek.
I'm happy.
you're not done.
I am happy.
isn't that the point? - No.
but in our lives, the breang point is a sign of weakness...
I need you to stay for the session.
I- I-- no. The meeting, the chief, I...
thank you, Dr. Wyatt.
thanks for everything.
and we'll do everything we can to avoid it.
whoa. - Oh, sorry.
what are you doing in here?
I'm thinking about making this my office when you move out.
when I move out?
when am I moving out?
Oh...soon?
did you know Meredith was planning on making us move out?
I'm kinda busy here, Iz.
you can join us if you want.
No!
when were you planning on telling us we had to move out?
when were you planning on telling them they had to move out?
what? Why do they have to move out?
Meredith, hey, look, I made this especially for you.
it's a zoo, a frat house, with Alex and his parade of women...
his parade of skanks.
whatever. Am I apartment hunting or what?
I don't know. I have to think about it.
well, just, you know, eat the muffin, mer.
taste the muffin.
remember the muffin.
I like my roommates.
I like them, too.
that was your life.
this is our life.
and I'm excited about building our life together.
come on. It's gonna be great.
so Derek wants Alex and Izzie to move out.
well, since when does he say "jump" and you jump?
well, I'm happy.
I'd be pissed off...
but, you know, whatever you want.
Hey, you hear anything about what the new rules are?
last I heard, you were at hand holding, foot rubs and lots of late-night gab sessions.
excuse me?
listen up, everyone.
Oh! No, you were talking about the, uh, chief's new rules.
I thought you were referring to you and Torres.
I've been wrong before.
we're busy people, so I'm gonna try and be brief.
I am implementing a new teaching protocol here at seattle grace.
now some of these rules are new, and some are old and are going to be newly enforced.
Jack O'brien, 47, scheduled for an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
his, uh, last C. T showed calcification, so I ordered a C. T. Angio to determine whether it had worsened or remained stable.
nice catch, Yang. You can take him down after rounds.
Dr. Karev will take over.
Dr. Yang, you're done here. Thank you.
first-, second- and third- year residents will no longer be allowed to defacto specialize.
the practice interferes with the development of a fully rounded surgical education.
no more. - barry patmore, 63...
has been experiencing chronic headaches for the past seven years, has been treated with narcotics, antiseizure medications, antidepressants and antipsychotic medications with no success.
how severe is the pain today, Mr. Patmore, scale of one to ten?
eight.
it's always an eight.
which is why Mr. Patmore's last consult suggested a bilateral cingulotomy -- I'm sorry, a frontal lobotomy for a headache?
too loud.
please.
and could you do something about the buzzing?
do we need all these machines?
Mr. Patmore has been experiencing intense pain all day, every day for seven years.
but the cingulotomy could cause seizures or cognitive defects or behavioral changes.
which is why we are going to explore every other possible option before resorting to such a radical surgery.
more tests.
Yes.
Dr. Yang, you'll be assisting Dr. Shepherd today.
personal relationships, personal loyalties and personal favorites will no longer be a factor in our training program.
attendings, you will spread your wealth of knowledge equally among all of the residents.
in addition, we will refocus our attention on patient communication and bedside manner.
for some of us, this means learning the lost art of humanity and compassion.
for others, this means learning how to treat patient without becoming emotionally involved with them.
Shelley Boden, 30, stage IV colon cancer with liver mets.
Shelley has been through extensive chemo and radiation, and according to the C. T. A liver resection at this point could be curative.
will be curative. Will.
do you have any other questions for us?
what happens if you find more cancer than you expect?
no, Jenn.
" a," that's not gonna happen, and "B," Izzie's already answered all of your questions three times.
well, Izzie's not the main surgeon.
Izzie's awesome.
we love izzie.
this is Dr. Grey.
she's gonna prep you for surgery and answer any more questions you have.
Izzie's not staying?
this is a surgical program.
psychiatry is on the fifth floor.
let's not confuse the two.
in addition, residents, your interns reflect on you.
if they fail, you fail.
if they succeed, you succeed.
attendings, that goes for residents as well.
teach with enthusiasm.
learn with enthusiasm.
we are surgeons.
we cut out malignancies.
let's start at home, people.
O'malley. This is Dr. Bennett Epstein.
he'll be your proctor for the exam today.
you about ready, O'malley?
Oh, yes, sir.
you have exactly three hours from the moment you open the test.
once you break the seal, you may not leave the room until you have completed the entire exam.
good luck, O'malley.
thank you, sir.
I can do this.
I am not married and cheating on my wife with my best friend.
everything's just as it should be.
damn chair.
hang on.
looks like the wheel's broken.
that's how things work around me.
my toaster broke last month, then my cat ran away and my back porch collapsed.
also, my TV only shows the color green.
I'll get another chair.
don't bother. I'll walk. Probably safer.
no, Mr. O'brien, you need to stay in the chair.
uh, it's hospital policy.
Mr. O'brien! - I've also had three car wrecks in the last year.
Mr. O'brien.
somebody get me a gurney over here.
sir, Im very sorry.
I hit my head.
I'm very, very sorry.
okay, get him a C. T. And I want hourly updates on his condition.
Yes, sir.
you're gonna be okay.
Mike, my ceiling's raining here.
it looks like a pipe burst.
we gotta turn off the water and isolate it.
no, no, this is the surgical floor.
water's required to scrub in, to clean equipment, to keep people alive.
I need you to fix this with the water on.
I can try.
all right, keep me posted.
um, chief...
there is some kind of leak in the conference room.
you don't say.
I was wondering if there was some--anywhere else that I could take the exam.
I will find a different room on my own.
thank you, sir.
we have a problem.
mark sloan has found us out.
mark's known from the beginning. I told him.
he's mark sloan.
well, you don't have a person that you talk to about things?
you are the person that I talk to about things.
and I like to keep my private life private
from everyone-- but most definitely from mark...sloan.
how long will the operation be?
at least a couple of hours.
you think it could be longer?
well, if there are complications or if the mets are more extensive -- they won't be. Jenn
but what if - jenn, please stop.
just call mom and dad, tell them two hours.
since I got cancer, my sister's only capable of talking about cancer, which is so much worse than the cancer.
so I know I don't know you, but spill.
spill what?
anything, I'm begging you, before she comes back and asks you to describe my liver cell by cell.
please.
okay.
um...
do you want to hear about my stupid boss or my stupid boyfriend?
Oh, boyfriend.
definitely the boyfriend.
okay, Mr. Patmore.
I'm gonna give you a variety of different stimuli so we can take a look at the wave patterns generated.
I need you to remove your hand from your eyes now.
okay, are we still at an eight?
it's still at eight.
okay.
starting visual stimuli.
if you were me, you'd want 'em out...
the roommates.
I'm not being unreasonable, right?
his pulse is coming down.
but u have to admit, you'd want them out.
if you were me, you would want them out.
if we have to operate, I'll let you drill burr holes by yourself.
fine, I'd want them out. Whatever.
knew it.
okay, Mr. Patmore.
okay, we're gonna change your position now, okay?
um, Dr. Yang, I think I have an idea.
well, don't think, know and run to the lab for his test results.
but Izzie bakes and Alex fixes things.
okay, when I am no longer cancer girl and I can go out and meet a hot doctor who rocks my world and wants to move in with me,
I might forgot the baked goods and repair work.
Ooh, heads-up, 12: 00.
just so you know, Cristina thinks you should move them out. You should talk to her.
Dude...you failed to mention the hair.
Yeah, yeah, the hair.
it's one of the many things that makes me happy.
Dr. Sloan, um, I'm working with shepherd today on a pain patient, and I read this article while i was helping george study...
pathetic.
Yes.
I know, I'm pathetic but I did read this article and I do have a photographic memory, and the chief's on his new thing where he wants the interns to be heard and not just seen
use fewer words, Grey.
I think he needs an E. N. T.
you're an E. N. T. Right?
how you doing in there, Mr. O'brien?
could be worse.
could have brain leaking from my ears .
that's the spirit.
it'll only take a couple more minutes. Hang on.
guess what I found-- an apartment, a beautiful apartment with hardwood floors and an honest-to-god fireplace that you can build honest-to-god fires in, and I can't afford it by myself.
so...
I thought if you could get over yourself, we could live together.
no, thanks.
did I mention the hardwood floors and the nest-to-god fireplace?
I'd rather live in my honest-to-god R.
right.
how's he doing, Karev?
you think we're looking at a lawsuit?
well, we don't have picture yet, but, uh, no.
this guy doesn't seem like the lawsuit type.
well, let's hope you're right.
Hello?
Hello?
I cannot apologize enough.
you treat him like a king.
you hear that, Mr. O'brien?
Dr. Karev is gonna take great care of you.
you're our number one priority today.
you okay?
God hates me.
Mr. O'brien, I am-- -my wife left me.
my accountant stole from me.
the store I worked at burned down.
I was diagnosed with an aneurysm for which I require surgery in a hospital that seems to be...
crumbling around me.
God hates me.
you can see the remaining tumor is easily identified here.
her liver looks so healthy.
that's the beauty of general surgery.
you see badness surrounded by goodness
cut out the badness, all is right with the world.
it's just you and your scalpel, one-on-one, mano a mano.
Y-- okay, this is me teaching with enthusiasm.
Oh, no.
O'malley. -What?
if you're finished with your test, um, look, the hospital's flooding, the C. T.Is on the fritz, my post-op and pre-op patients are backed up for days.
I gotta get a handle on this thing before the patients find out and our ranking drops way past 12.
I found a nice, quiet room in psych for you to take your exam.
Oh, I-I-I see.
um, yeah, you--you-- you go ahead.
chief.
I am your intern at least for one more day.
I can help.
Dr. Shepherd, a word.
excuse me one second.
uh, do you, uh, mind if I run a quick test on your patient?
he's in a lot of pain, mark.
I don't think he needs a tummy tuck.
Oh, that's funny.
no, uh, Dr. Grey came to me with an interesting idea, and, uh, unlike you, I'm taking the chief's new teaching protocol seriously, so I listened.
uh, I-I read a thing about swelling and compression of the ethmoid nerve.
I believe if we were to stick a cottle elevator up his nose
no, I'm--I'm sorry.
up his nose?
if Dr. Grey is on the right track, the, uh, patient will let us know.
okay.
Mr. Patmore, I'm Dr. Sloan.
I'm the head of plastic surgery and an ear, nose and throat specialist.
I'd like to run a quick test if I can have your permission.
I've seen 16 E. N. T.s, not one could help me.
now breathe normally.
I'm gonna angle this into here.
you let me know when you feel any...pain or anything.
that's it!
that's the pain!
that's what's causing the pain.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
okay.
anterior ethmoid neurovascular complex.
a simple middle turbinectomy will fix it.
unless you still want to chop out the front of his brain.
nicely done.
Hi.
how'd it go?
Hi, shelley, um...
we found that the mets were much more extensive than the C. T. detected, and the main tumor actually extended in and around the major blood vessel behind the liver.
we're just gonna start a new round of chemo.
that's all.
I already have a call in to your oncologist.
that's him.
I'll-- I'll be right back.
we can manage your pain.
I'm sorry we don't have better news.
so did you...
decide what to do about your roommates?
I'm so sorry, shelley.
come on.
so how good is the hot boyfriend in bed?
look...
we don't even know what we are yet.
so how does mark sloan know?
why are you talking to him...
instead of me?
ladies.
am I interrupting?
you're timing is perfect.
Really?
are you about to feel her up?
stop. You have to stop.
I can't.
seriously, she hates it.
that's why I can't.
don't--you want a spanking?
I-- - okay?
so you told Derek you think I shoul dick them out?
no.
no, I was
I told him I would want them out--me, not you
and I only said it 'cause hewouldn't stop talking.
so you don't think I should kick them out?
cause I think I'm going to.
I mean, I think it's the adult thing to do, don't you?
what does your shrink say?
I quit my shrink.
I'm happy. We're happy.
Hey, can I sit here?
George, uh, how--how did it go?
I just-- there was a water problem.
I mean, I'm just trying to help the chief even though all the medical facts are falling out of my ear onto the floor.
eat this. It's brain food.
my dude with the aneurysm?
fell in the water, smacked his head and got stuck in the C. T. Machine.
my patient's dying.
I hate it when I like them and they're dying.
our guy's been living in pain
pain at a constant eight for the last seven years
because of an inflamed nerve in his nose. That's crazy.
I wish I had an inflamed nerve in my nose.
there is no way that that guy has been living at an eight.
he a wimp.
his eight, my three. I can take pain.
you can't talk to my boyfriend for ten minutes.
well, there's pain and then there's torture.
and I can take pain. Seriously, test me.
nothing.
that's impressive.
shut up.
you barely touched her.
no, no. -No!
knock it off!
stop it!
um, how did you diagnose that nerve, because I've never even heard of that condition before?
I remembered an article from the "british journal of E. N. T.
," And it was issue number 47, page 19 from 1964.
photographic memory.
dude, lex-opedia.
Oh, I hate you.
don't hate me. I can help you.
Oh, uh, chief.
what's going on with the flood?
it's not a flood, bailey.
it's a pipe that...
it's minor, okay.
not to worry.
aren't you headed to surgery?
Yes, sir.
uh, chief, a few months ago, little tuck flushed one of his action figures down the toilet, and I thought it was no big deal, minor.
Buthen I came home to a kitchen filled with several inches of poop water.
poop water?
in my kitchen, sir.
thank you, Dr. Bailey, but I have this under control.
Yes, sir.
poop water.
hey so apparently there's some kind of leak, and the chief wants me to move all the pre-op patients to the clinic.
so who's free to help me?
not a high pain threshold, huh?
you know what? Throw him out.
not me, just him.
she likes me more.
I bake for everyone and I clean.
the only thing you bring to the house is filth.
what would you prefer, Meredith, chocolate cake or an S. T. D?
water!
Oh, god. It's everywhere.
what's happening? What happened? -come on.
let's keep moving. Move! -somebody get the chief.
post-ops to rooms 2415.
pre-ops to rooms 2233, 4 and 5.
the overflow goes into the clinic.
chief.
I-I got everything under control up here, but I need you to oversee stevens with the pre-ops in the clinic.
okay, sir, maybe we need to shut down, just send the patients to mercy west, seattle pres.
they can repair the pipe, and we'll be up and running in no time.
I am sending all our patients to dry ground.
I closed all but two O. R.S. Maintenance has isolated the broken pipe.
so thank you, Dr. Bailey, but when I say that I've got it under control, that's what I mean.
but, sir, they may have isolated it, but a lot of water got out before they did.
I'm just saying that maybe
Dr. Bailey, clinic, now!
Yes, sir.
on my way.
Hey, hey, slow down.
okay, what next?
wait. Are you sure you have time for this?
I really want you to get to take your test.
thank you.
uh, despite your, uh, unfortunate taste in men, it turns out you're not entirely useless.
Mr. Patmore's condition is extremely rare, and you nailed it.
you can scrub in.
now?
you're doing the surgery now, with the--with the flood?
the flood's contained, and our man's been in pain for seven years.
see you in surgery.
I can't.
I'm sorry, um, but I'm busy
I'm really busy helping the chief with the-- chief's, um, intern.
I-I--thank you, but maybe next time?
no, lassie.
there won't be a next time.
pathetic.
Mr. Patmore, I'm just gonna draw somdbloo and, uh, place a topical decongestant before I take you to surgery.
Absolutely. Of course.
how's your pain level now?
eight.
it's always at eight.
Oh.
well, it looked like you had some relief.
I've spent seven years...
I've seen 39 doctors...
and I've tried every kind of painkiller, and nothing helps.
I've had doctors tell me it's my imagination...
that I'm crazy...
call me a drug addict.
my wife died last year.
after spending years carting me around to doctor after doctor, test after test, she died.
she was my best friend.
she was my favorite person.
and she died...
and I couldn't feel it.
I couldn't feel that pain because I was so completely occupied witthis one.
and now I finally know what's wrong, and Dr. Sloan's gonna fix it.
so you're right.
you're right that I'm feeling some relief.
okay, let's get your blood drawn.
I'm not gonna do it. I'm not gonna have surgery.
it's just gonna hurt.
she's gonna slice me in half and probably kill me.
if she doesn't kill me, it'll just hurt like hell.
probably get infected and hurt worse.
I'm not gonna do it.
look, I get that you're scared, but if you want to live, you need the surgery.
if I want to live?
have you been paying any attention?
my girlfriend had a hysterical pregnancy, went nuts, cut her wrists while I was in the next room and had to be committed.
and now my roommate's planning to make me move out.
I have no money for a deposit anywhere else, so chances are, next week, I'm homeless.
you making stuff up to make me feel better?
look, you must have something to live for.
or even just the possibility of something.
there's a girl at the grocery store.
I keep meaning to say hello.
instead I...
just keep asking her about the produce.
all right.
so you get the surgery.
cause chances are your-- your luck's gonna turn around.
it's science.
it's--it's-- it's the law of averages.
it's gonna turn around.
and when it does...
you say hello.
I say hello.
chips?
chocolate?
Thanks.
what?
you're not a terrible person.
okay.
I know we don't always see eye to eye, but...
I found this really great apartment.
it's right across the street from the hospital.
it has really great light.
I know you can afford it, and it's burke-free.
it must be kind of awful living in his old place.
think about it.
you can open that retractor up a little more if you want to get a better look.
just make sure you keep the small bowel inside.
we want to avoid a post-op ileus.
well, we better.
the dude thinks there's a dark cloud following him around.
well, that sounds overly dramatic.
what's that?
What's-- what the hell?
Hey, mo-move-- move the patient.
what?
move the patient!
Oh, my god!
is everyone okay? How's our patient?
he's stable. Vitals holding steady.
all right. Irrigation, please.
how can I help?
uh, find the chief and tell him what happened.
God, we need a new O. R.
they shut down all the other O. R.s except for this one and Dr. Sloan's.
okay, uh, Karev, go to Sloan.
he just got started. Maybe he can close.
all right. I need everybody's help.
we're gonna get ready to move Mr. O'brien.
what do I tell Sloan?
just tell him the damn sky is falling.
nasal speculum and lidocaine.
larger speculum. Another lidocaine.
we're just watching?
I'm a pain specialist, and I would've missed this thing.
so, yes, we're just gonna watch.
don't ever use me again to try and influence her.
you and I are not team Meredith.
we need the O. R.
we need the O. R!
on a patient?
Yes, sir.
collapsed?
your staff wasn't hurt, but the patient's abdomen was open.
he's stable as far as I know.
Dr. Bailey, spread the word.
we are closing the surgical floor and shipping our patients out to mercy west and seattle presbyterian.
Yes, sir.
and, Dr. Bailey...
try not to gloat on the way out.
no gloating, sir.
anybody see any more damage, any bleeding?
no, no bleeding. I just cleared the lower left quadrant.
give me the pulse irrigator.
Dr. Hahn, take a look at this right here.
the pancreas--is that, uh, damage from the debris?
no, no.
that's a tumor.
Oh, son of a bitch.
you're the shrink, right? -Yeah.
well, you can't let her quit.
let me guess.
she talks ab-- whatever.
um, you can't let her quit because I'm no longer allowed an opinion because I'm being supportive. So...
you're my last hope.
I mean, it's your job to have an opinion, right?
you're paid to have an opinion?
that's right.
okay, so, um...
she lives her life at an eight.
her pain...
on any given day, she lives at an eight.
and he doesn't get that.
I mean, he moves in and expects her to-- to move her roommates out?
which goes to show you how completely he doesn't get her, because she needs them.
so you need to tell her not to move them out.
I mean, it's not gonna work out in the long run anyway, and she thinks that she's happy, but she's not.
and it's your job to tell her.
it must be incredibly painful for you
the idea of losing Meredith to Derek.
you're a terrible shrink.
just talk to the oncologist. -No.
there's a clinical trial using chemo plus avastin.
and there's-- you're not a doctor.
please stop talking like you're a doctor.
did you have me paged?
Yes, because...
I'm dying, and you can't let me die without knowing what you decided.
you look very serious.
Oh, my god.
are you gonna break up with him?
no fair.
I'm dying, and you're casting all that hotness in the wind.
no fair.
no fair.
no fair.
it's no fair.
it's no fair.
no fair, no fair, no fair.
Dr. Hahn's gonna come in and talk to you in a couple of minutes.
how'd it go?
okay?
actually, not so okay.
uh, the flood weakened the ceiling in the O. R.
the ceiling collapsed in several fragments, landed inside your incision.
because of the ceiling thing, we had to explore your abdomen more thoroughly than we normally would have, and...
as a result, we found a malignant tumor on your pancreas.
cancer?
you found cancer?
well, wait, wait.
listen, listen to me,'cause here's the thing
we took it out, we sent it to pathology.
it was only stage I.
only stage I.
we never find pancreatic tumors so early.
they're almost always a death sentence by the time they're diagnosed.
but not for you.
we took the tumor, the whole thing.
we took it out.
you won't even need chemo.
that ceiling collapse, it...
it saved your life.
your luck has turned, man.
it's turned.
I'm gonna say hello...to that girl.
I'm gonna say hello.
chief.
chief?
Ch-chief, I've downloaded all our patients labs and radiology onto dvds, and I've attached them to each of their charts.
is there anything else I can do to help?
how'd it go?
I-I know.
I'm pathetic.
and george doesn't know I exist.
and I missed my surgery and blah, blah, blah.
could you please just tell me how it went with mr. Patmore?
we didn't get to do the surgery.
Mr. Patmore has been shipped off to another hospital, and he will be out of pain by this time tomorrow.
photographic memory, huh?
Yeah.
periodic table. Go.
hydrogen, helium, lithium, beryllium, boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, neon, sodium, magnesium, aluminum, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur...
I can keep going.
we could burn actual wood?
see? That's my favorite part.
you can't--you can't find that anymore.
look at this. It's gorgeous.
what do you think?
thank you! This is a fantastic apartment.
we totally love it. -Love it. Love it. I love it.
it was really great of you, Izzie. Really, thank you.
you're kidding, right?
you're kidding, right?
Cristina, are you kidding me?
I am getting kicked out of my house.
you think I pulled this off the board for you?
I was asking you to live there with me.
Oh, uh, I'm sorry. -Oh, yeah.
I'm so--wow. Hilarious.
but no, I'm sorry.
I-- listen, I--I'm-- I'm walking to the bar.
you know what? You are just-- I...
give me the flyer um...
I already put a deposit down. I'm sorry.
I mean, you should've been more clear.
fine. You know what?
it's fine. Keep it.
that's totally fine. You know, enjoy. That's fine!
thank you.
I get that you're a private .
but I am not. I process my stuff out loud.
and I gave up too much of myself in my marriage.
I can't...
give up pieces of myself again.
and, uh, Mark is my friend.
I think I just hate him because he's seen you naked.
what was the point?
all those hours and all that money
what's the point? The world is a horrible place.
young people die of diseases.
it makes absolutely no sense to try to be happy in a world that's such a horrible place.
Yes.
what?
Yes, horrible things do happen.
happiness in the face of all of that
that's not the goal.
feeling the horrible and knowing that you're not gonna die from those feelings, that's the point.
and you're not done.
you've made progress because you're feeling and you're telling me about it.
six months ago, it would've been just you and a bottle of tequila.
my door is always open.
bones break...
organs burst...
flesh tears...
are you okay?
you know, I'm happy for you.
I am. I'm really happy for you and Derek and that you guys are moving forward. I am...
I don't know how it happened that I don't have anyone, but...
I don't have anyone.
that's not true, Iz.
it's not true.
hello.
we can sew the flesh, repair the damage...
ease the pain.
I found your mom's vintage martini set.
they're my family.
you can't just assume I'm gonna kick my family out.
and you don't get to announce it to them and ambush me.
and you definitely don't get to try to get Cristina on your side.
they're my family.
they're who I have-- you and them.
okay.
okay?
I'd like to talk about it again when you're ready.
but for now, okay.
so you still love me?
but when life breaks down...
when we break down......
Yes.
there's no science, no hard and fast rules.
we just have to feel our way through, and to a surgeon, there's nothing worse and there's nothing better.
you sure about this, sir? You've had a long day.
it's one thing to stand on a stage and give a speech.
but if I want our teaching program to be the best, and I do, then it starts here, and it starts with me.
I can't do anying about the flood, but I can give you your shot, O'malley.
you earned it.
you ready? -Yes, sir.
okay.
three hours.
go.
I had a bad night and I cried like a girl. I'm over it.
you need to get over it, too.
I'm retaking my intern test.
you and I are more than just roommates. -Yeah, we're friends.
I mean, right now, you're probably one of my best friends. -best friends.
you're the only woman I've ever kissed.
so you're freaking out, too? -A lot of therapy time.
well, Derek's moved in. And we've taken it to the next level.
I am happy.
in 6500 B. C. , Some guy looked at his sick friend and said, "I have an idea. Why don't I drill a hole in your skull?
it'll make you feel better.
and thus, surgery was born.
Where's Mer? -She's not here.
so you're just in there by yourself?
I'm not. I'm--I'm waiting for her.
love the out fit.
what do you want? -I need cash.
I ordered a pizza, and Alex owes me 20 bucks, but he's not speaking to me because I saw him crying over his crazy girlfriend.
and there was a minute a week ago that I actually thought he was gonna be a human being, and now he won open the door.
run into the bathroom. Just go. Go!
give me a $20.
that was so awesome. You're pretty cool.
not that I didn't think you were cool before, but, you know, I did not.
I kinda just thought you were all hair and, you know.
now, cool. You want to share some pizza?
it takes a certain brand of crazy to come up with an idea like drilling into somebody's skull.
but surgeons have always been a confident bunch.
your clothes, your room.
the living room will not be a dumping ground like the old place was.
did you not hear her?
okay. She kinda scares me. -'Cause she's scary.
Callie needs a new best friend.
not bad, right?
it great.
we usually know what we're doing, and when we don't, we still act like we do.
we walk boldly into undiscovered country, plant a flag and start ordering people around.
do you want to go on a date with me?
it's invigorating and terrifying.
like a "date" date?
Yeah, you know, a restaurant candlelight, bottle of wine
at the end of the night, I try to take your clothes off?
okay, that's. that would be a date.
you're. -Naked and waiting for you.
you keep a diary? Have I not known that all this time, that you keep a diary?
no, I-I-I don't.
I, uh-- aw, don't be shy. I think it's cute.
it's not mine. -I won't read it.
whose is it?
your mother's.
it was in a big box full of old issues of "the New England Journal of Medicine.
did you read it?
no.
I brought it up here for you.
why were you going through her things? -I was trying to find space for my clothes.
your closet is full.
I have to, um, shower. I've been hauling Cristina's boxes.
you haven't read any of it? -No, what if I'm in it?
I don't want to hear what she thought of me. I've heard enough of that already.
what's worse, if you're in it or you're not in it? -I don't know.
but I mean, see, why is he in the study rooting around in closets.
trying to dig up my mother's ghost?
I think 'cause you invited him.
apparently some people thought I was kidding last week when I announced that nobody was going to get to hang out on their favorite specialty anymore.
I wasn't.
junior residents don't specialize.
so all the requests to send you back to that place where your true heart lives can end now.
Dr. Bailey makes the assignments. Do not, and I repeat, do not harangue her.
look, O'malley, I made a call.
they don't have your score yet. If I knew, I would tell you.
you passed.
we're gonna go to Joe's tonight and we're gonna celebrate.
I'm gonna buy you a beer and all the peanuts you can eat.
what if I didn't pass?
well, then I'm still buying you a beer. Beer for losers.
Grey, you're on cardio with hahn today.
Oh, but- - Stevens and Kare pit.
Oh, come on. That's not--the chief wants us to have a change.
that's not a change. I'm always stuck in the pit with Alex.
when the chief said don't harangue Dr. Belley, what do you think he meant?
yang, clinic.
what? What? No. No.
no, no, wait, wait. The clinic is mine.
I say how it's staffed. -Yeah, yeah.
she'll just ruin it. Yeah, I will. I'll -I'll ruin it.
just let me do it.
no, you will not. You will do what I say.
and since Yang couldn't be bothered to show up at the clinic since it opened, think of it as a new frontier in her training.
sorry.
Oh, oh, oh, my god. You're totally not sorry.
you're psyched. You got Hahn.
if you're not, you should be. -Well, she's terrifying.
and you have given her unrealistic expectations as to what a resident should know.
just stay on top of the material, and don't get all warm and fuzzy with the patients.
she had one through four, let's go. Come on.
I didn't read the diary.
I just found it and put it on the table.
I would've read it.
every time I actually do something to move into the house, she freaks out.
what are you gonna do with the trailer?
no. -Come on.
cause there's a very real possibility she kicks me out in a week.
I'm not letting go of the trailer.
sutures, fecal impaction and more sutures. -She'll do it.
what do you mean, she'll do it?
you're good at boring, stupid crap. You're like a specialist.
Hi, I'm Dr. Stevens. Looks like you need some stitches.
what happened? -I have a cut.
how'd you get it?
I threw a remote at him, okay? It's no big secret.
I threw it at him because all he can do is watch television or fall asleep like a dead person.
HONEY-- don't "honey" me.
I'm divorcing you.
as soon as you stop bleeding from your head, we're going to a lawyer.
you ever been to europe? -Nope. Someday.
don't wait until you're retired and you can't be bothered to look out the window.
6-month trip across the world-- I've been waiting for it for 15 years
he slept through the whole thing.
Marianne-- six continents.
I worked for 30 years. I was very tired.
well, I'm tired, too, of being married to somebody with no interest in the world, so everybody's tired.
I'm gonna go get some coffee. I assume this is going to take forever.
probably.
does your mouth always do that, move to the side like that?
like what?
mind if I run some tests?
whatever you want. -Great.
I may be wrong about this, but I think Mr. Grandy has a major neuro thing going on.
so get him stitched up and then get him up for a C. T.Okay?
okay.
Oh, give me that. Give it.
Mr. Grandy, uh, I'm Dr. Karev, and I will be taking you up for your C. T Today.
duncan Paley, age 8, recently diagnosed with aortic valve disease from an infectious endocarditis.
he's scheduled for a Ross procedure today.
there's a note from his pediatrician-- Duncan!
Duncan, get back here. -Duncan!
stop him. Grab him.
go.
Duncan, come back here.
Duncan, you get down from there right. -Duncan, get off the chair.
no, do not. Don't touch the fire alarm. -Do not pull that. That would be very, very bad.
I'm not having surgery.
Munchkin-- No!
I'm not doing it.
one, two-- Counting doesn't work.
No! -Three.
I think this is all gonna be okay if we just-- promise me no surgery.
promise me no surgery.
O--I--we-- we can't really do that.
evacuate.
evacuate.
evacuate.
this is an emergency.
evacuate.
do we have this kid under control, or do I have to call social services?
he won't do anything like that again. -He'd better not.
the damn ceiling fell last week. I don't need a series of false alarms.
this place looks ridiculous enough already.
keep the ankle biter under control.
I'll sedate him if I have to.
good, and bone up on your pulmonary autografts.
I don't want to spend the day bathed in your ignorance as well as your incompetence.
Oh, she hates me.
what do you mean, we'll sedate him if we have to?
I was just trying not to be warm and fuzzy.
I don't mean sedate him, I just mean babysit him.
it's your last day as an intern. Just think of how happy you'll be to move on.
I'm gonna be in the O. R.till 7: 00. Is 8: 00 too late for dinner?
no, but if you need to reschedule or cancel
come on. Are you kidding? I made a reservation at Canto.
I even gamed out an outfit.
we are doing this.
so Hahn is doing a ross procedure, and she thinks I'm a moron.
well, first of all, it's called a pulmonary autograft. She likes the technical names.
tell her you're excited to watch her harvest the pulmonary valv using her septal-sparing technique.
if you cut too much of the septal muscle, the patient won't be able to come off pump.
none of that is in the book. -It's the key to the case.
it'll make you sound like you've been around the block once or twice. -Perfect.
I can't believe I am giving you all my best stuff.
you totally don't deserve it.
uh, Dr. Yang.
Mrs. Borsokowski needs your loving attention.
redness, itching, inflammation--a rash. You're giving me a rash?
no, she's the mean one. I don't want her.
o-okay.
all right. What do we got?
take a look. The thing's bigger than a baseball.
it's right behind his eyes.
this should be fun. Page Stevens.
she left the guy with me.
she gave you the case?
Yeah, well, Izzie felt bad for me.
you know, figured this would cheer me up.
in that case, you're gonna help me pull this thing out.
Hey, Duncan.
we're gonna put an I. V. In your arm real quick, and then you can go back to your playing, okay?
what is it? -Oh, it's a little tube we put in your arm.
no.
Duncan-- no, it's gonna hurt.
come on, kiddo. It's not gonna hurt.
no, it's gonna hurt.
it's a needle. It's gonna hurt.
but it's only for, what, three seconds?
I don't believe you. -You don't believe me?
what, do you want me to prove it to you?
I'll prove it. I'll have Dr. Grey put one in me.
this is a tourniquet, and, uh, you wrap it around your arm so that your vein pops out.
see? Like that?
so now the needle-- that's the part that's gonna hurt.
that goes in, and that's--Yeah.
hurting. That hurts.
it hurts and.
it doesn't hurt anymore.
and now that stuff goes into here. Doesn't hurt at all.
okay, I'll do it.
okay. Then I'll go get another I. V.Kit. -Okay.
you're really good at this.
Oh, I was an airplane guy, too, when I was his age.
us airplane guys, I think we just like to know how things work.
I'm sorry about the alarm.
Oh, I know.
move!
they have the nerve to be indignant about how they're not allowed to be on their specialties anymore.
they don't have specialties.
they should be grateful they're even allowed in the-- are you listening to me?
I'm going on a date with Erica Hahn.
and, uh, that's awkward 'cause, uh.
she's a colleague and because she's an attending and because she's a she.
and, uh, there's been kissing, but, uh, no touching.
and what if I'm not intot? What--what if-- what if I'm horrible at all that stuff.
south of the border?
cause I've never been south of the border with a female.
I mean, I--I've never even been over the, uh, northern mountains, you know what I'm saying?
we're gonna pretend this didn't happen.
Mr. Grandy?
what are you doing in here?
they admitted me. My new doctor, Dr. Karev, said I have a huge tumor in my head.
have you seen my wife?
your new doctor?
somebody paged me?
Oh, I have a patient with tenderness and erythema extending from her upper chest to her left arm.
I'm thinking she needs irrigation and debridement.
she said you may have to amputate my arm.
no. That's a simple rash. It's not a flesh-eating bacteria. It's probably dermatitis.
no, no, no, but look how the skin is denuded. It could be surgical, right?
it's possible-- it's a rash. If it's dry, wet it. If it's wet, dry it.
go to Derm, get a tube of cerave cream, and don't ever page me to hustle a surgery again.
it was supposed to be done yesterday, done.
so exactly why did I walk into my O. R. and still see a massive, gaping hole in where the ceiling was supposed to be?
if you see Karev, get an 18-gauge needle and shove it in his throat.
I have cultivated a look that says I'm not interested in your personal probleMs.
can you morons not read that look, or have I lost the hang of it?
because people are telling me a lot of personal problems today.
I don't give a crap about your crushing workload or your baffling love life or your carpal tunnel syndrome.
derm
all I care about is Mrs. Carrucci, a 92-year-old woman who no one can seem to find.
Hi. I'm Dr. Pepman. Can I help you?
uh, yeah, um, where can I get some cerave cream?
um, our nurses look like they're tied up, but if you don't mind waiting, I can get it for you myself.
would you like some water with raspberries while you wait?
uh, yeah, sure.
Hi, Chris.
Oh, don't mind Chris. He's our massage therapist.
your. uh, what?
our hands do such delicate work, it's important that they stay healthy.
so we have Chris on staff to work on us when we have a spare moment.
every attending gets their hands massaged at work?
Oh, no. The dermatology attendings have another therapist.
Chris just works on the residents.
you're a resent? -First year, and loving it.
so I'll make an incision ear to ear then peel down the face.
and I'll crack open his forehead, pull the tumor right out.
and we need to keep a close eye on the optic nerve.
somebody twitches, and this guy's blind.
which one of your roommates will be assisting?
Karev. -Oh, great.
Dr. Shepherd, I want back on this case.
this is my patient. Alex stole him from me.
remember when I was telling you that
Dr. Stevens, let's be clear. In this hospital, I am not your roommate.
I don't give a crap about your personal problems.
I have a resident. I don't need another one.
Dr. Shepherd. -Yes?
patient's in his room if you want to go over the procedure with him. -Great.
you son of a bitch. -Go cry to somebody who cares.
this is my case. It isn't fair.
surgery's like the wild west.
you didn't get your claim in Montana from the bank.
you got it 'cause you put a fence around it and shot the ass off anyone who walked by.
Karev's a cowboy. You're not.
we're gonna transect the great arteries at the sinotubular ridge, use the autograft to replace the aortic root, and then attach a pulmonary homograft.
are you going to use the septal-sparing technique for the pulmonary autograft?
Yes, why do you ask?
well, because if we cut too much of the septal muscle, we won't be able to take the patient off pump, right?
right. -Great.
I've always wanted to see a septal-sparing technique.
do you know how to reanastomose the coronary arteries back on to the aorta?
I do.
well, I'll let you sew part of it in. Gonna be in there.
might as well get your hands dirty.
great. Thanks, Dr. Hahn.
you're going to hell 'cause you're a liar.
was it obvious? -unfortunately, no.
what?
what happened?
look.
you paged me 9-1-1.
I'm in the middle of studying for Hahn's pulmonary autograft, and I don't see an emergency.
no, no, no.
they're residents.
that one baked a 7-layer cake for that one's birthday, from scratch.
Oh, oh, and--and that one, that one's, uh, girlfriend. is taking him skiing this weekend.
Oh, but this one's the best.
okay, this one gets to leave to go get a facial.
and she told her attending, and her attending was happy 'cause they have to have facials.
they're dermatologists.
I mean. -Oh, my god.
the hospital has hired someone to rub them. full-time.
I bet their boyfriends don't go digging around in their closets without asking.
never.
I told Hahn I knew how to do a coronary artery reanastomosis.
you don't. -I know.
I looked it up, but the kid's 8. He's got tiny little arteries.
okay, you know what? Um, snag me some of those grapes there, and I'll teach you.
Oh, and then find Dr. Daisy Pepman.
ask her for a suture kit and a 7-0 polypropylene.
Dr. Daisy pepman? -She's a resident.
she pours fruity drinks. 'Cause she has time for that kind of thing.
and I like saying her name.
so is that hyphenated, or did her parents name her daisy -- no, no. Hey, no--no mocking.
there is no mocking in Derm.
only warmth and light.
you all right, Mrs. Paley?
you want to know what Duncan's doing?
packing to leave, and I can't stop him.
I suck at this.
I'm tired and I'm fried because I lie awake at night listening to him breathe because I'm afraid his heart's gonna stop and he's gonna die, and I'll have been sleeping.
I don't know how to do this.
well, no one knows how to be the mom of a kid with heart failure. Nobody teaches that.
and you have a really smart kid. You know that.
we just need to up our game a little bit.
can I try? -Oh, go for it.
a baseball?
which is why you were so lethargic.
why I slept through most of our trip, perhaps?
not because I'm boring and uninterested in the cultures of the world?
how was I supposed to know?
you were supposed to give me the benefit of the doubt, not throw electronics at me.
uh, Mr. Grandy, this is a massive tumor in an area that's very hard to reach.
you're gonna want to talk about this with your wife.
Oh, I'm sure she's fine with the risks.
Arnie-- I'm going through with it.
I've got nothing left to lose.
we'll see you in the O. R.
Dr. Shepherd, that is my patient.
I'm sure you can use another resident, even if you can't
Stevens, I am not the traffic cop on the playground.
no, it's not the playground. It's the wild, wild west.
and you're the sheriff. Can't you be the sheriff?
I'll think of you when we crack his forehead open.
I'm not letting you do this to me, Alex. Do not walk away from me, Karev.
give me back my surgery or I'll shoot your ass off!
he stole a very big surgery.
I'll pick it up.
What'd you do with the diary? -It's in my locker.
Hey, do you want me to screen it for you?
Magic-marker-out all the scary parts.
no. No one's reading it. -Okay, now don't. here.
don't pull too hard. You're stretching the skin.
Alex stole my patient with a grapefruit growing behind his eyes, and your boyfriend couldn't give a crap.
and just in case I wasn't sure, he actually said the words,"I don't give a crap.
okay, see that guy there? Okay?
he's a resident. He's dragging 'cause he got too much sleep last night.
too much. -What?
it's like watching a living freak show.
I don't talk about sex.
please. let's just pretend I never said even a single word.
I don't talk about sex with anyone, ever, not any kind of sex.
Bailey, I am begging you - zz-zz.
the vah-jay-jay is undiscovered country.
it is the motherland.
you've never traveled there.
you don't know its customs and ways.
now me, I've always wanted to go to Africa.
uh, but if I go, I'm going to have to learn a few things first.
I'm going to have to prepare.
I'll need shots, um, bring my own syringes in case something goes wrong, - and--and I'll want to know how to get to the embassy, just...- okay, now you've lost me.
just talk about it.
not with me. With the other one.
just talk about the rules, uh, the expectations, figure out how to gracefully demure if you find that you don't like the--the local cuisine.
in Ethiopia, they eat stew off of spongy, sour bread.
that's not for everyone.
Mer, I need you.
harshing the vibe.
what are you doing?
Cristina found this magical world where doctors are happy and patients are pleasant and no one is screaming or stealing surgeries.
everyone just rubs each other all day long.
you all want to be dermatologists?
dermatologists apply lotion for a living.
Yeah, that's the point. Come here. Come here.
s-- they're empty inside. Completely devoid of blood lust.
they don't need to fight for anything.
they don't want to cut anyone open.
they just.
love lotion.
do you know how much easier our life would be if we could just love lotion?
how do you think they got that way?
their mothers didn't leave diaries around for them to read.
Sloan told me today to stake my claim in the wild, wild west.
so I went all cowboy on Alex's ass, and I still don't have my surgery.
these women.
they do not have to stake a claim.
okay.
you all need to snap out of it. Izzie.
in the wild, wild west, there is always a woman in the saloon and nobody messes with her, even though they all have guns.
she's a prostitute.
the woman in the saloon is a whore, George.
no. She just has other skills she uses to make her way in the world.
so just, uh, use what you got.
Mer, I'm gonna take this, and I need you to help me sell an idea to Hahn and the chief.
Cristina. - Hmm?
you're coming, too.
how you doing, Mr. Grandy?
we, um. I've got a tumor that's been compared to a baseball, a grapefruit and an alie living inside my head, and. my wife.
who was ready to divorce me even before she knew that I was damaged goods, she won't even look at me.
no, I'm sure she's just freaked out about the tumor. It happens a lot.
what if it isn't just the tumor?
I mean, what if she's figured out that she just doesn't like me?
no. You're a really likable guy. I can tell.
you're a nice girl.
is, um.
is your new doctor as nice as me--Dr. Karev?
he's all right.
that's good. Yeah.
he was having some personal problems, depression.
he's been a little off his game, but.
W--off his game?- Well, it sounds like he's bouncing back. You'll be fine.
w-wait a minute. I don't want someone who's off his ga.
can I get, uh, you back?
Oh, gee. Um, well.
well, you could talk to Dr. Shepherd, tell him you don't want Dr. Karev on your case, and then I'm all yours.
what happened?
she said she was feeling faint, and I thought she was just pissed about waiting for her cream.
her pulse ox is 90? - Yeah, and the oxygen's not helping.
get her to the E. R.
why didn't you move her to the E. R?
well, I-I didn't know what to do.- I-- so what, you've just been standing here?
no, I've been paging you. - Where the hell have you been?
OK, here, um, aggressive fluids, supportive care, steroids.
give her 16 of dexamethasone.
hurry. Come on!
B. P. 'S going back up.
okay, um, call Dr. Bailey and tell her the patient needs a plasmapheresis and a skin biopsy stat.
you stole my surgery. - It's my surgery.
using me as a doormat is one thing.
screwing with my career is another.
I have been wiping your snot and covering your ass for weeks now, and all you've done is abuse me.
and for a little while, you get to do that because you're heartbroken and pathetic, and I'm a good friend, but it ends now.
get your own surgeries and wipe your own snot.
Dr. Shepherd, that's my surgery.
the patient made the request, Karev.
nothing I can do.
60% of her skin sloughed off.
I'm surprised she didn't crash when she got out of bed this morning.
Dr. Sloan didn't catch it when he was down here for a consult?
Oh, he may have been distracted by the fact I told him it was necrotizing fasciitis.
that would do it.
uh, can I do the biopsy?
well, sure.
I didn't know you had a big interest in dermatology.
no, I-I don't, just the surgical part.
that's all right. It's good. Branch out.
no, Dr. Bailey, I'm not interested in Derm.
Atology.
we're doing a bicoronal incision. Expect a lot of bleeding.
once I get going, it'll all happen fast, so stay with me. - Stevens, grab a bovie.
all right.
here we go.
you are not bringing an 8-year-old child into the O. R.
he's scared, and he doesn't know what's gonna happen, ane theris no way for him to imagine it.
letting the boy see a bloody O. R. Isn't gonna help matters, O'malley.
Dr. Hahn has a thorascopic lung resection in an hour-- three tiny incisions, no blood, nothing scary.
and what's that gonna do? - It's gonna show him the room, the people, the instrument someone under anesthesia who's still alive.
pinning him down and doping him up is.
it's gonna be traumatic for him and it's.
showing him how it works is such an easy fix.
you can't see, can you? - Nope.
I don't want to go in there.
scared?
well, there's not gonna be any blood-- nothing gross, nothing scary.
it's just three tiny cuts that are so small, you can barely see 'em.
the first time that I went in there, in that room, I was scared.
but that room is the most magical room in the world.
only the finest doctors get to go in there, and a lot of the great ones, they're not even allowed to touch anything.
they can just watch.
I'm pretty good, so I'm still a watcher.
the people that work in there, they're just-- they're the best, the very best.
it's the safest place you'll ever be in in your entire life.
Where'd that guy's face go?
you lost, O'malley?
sorry.
no, wait! I want to see! I want to see the guy with no face!
stop! Stop!
never mention this happened to anyone, I'll give you whatever you want for the rest of your life.
okay? - Okay.
good afternoon, Duncan.
come on in and take a look.
I want to go back to the other one.
we're not talking about the other one.
this one's boring. - Yeah? Well, yours will be boring, too.
do I get the big lights?
Yeah, you get all the big lights.
Where's the suctioner?
it's right over there. - Can I feel it?
I just want to feel it once.
move over first.
can I touch the scalpel?
you just need to lie down.
I just want to see everything.
look here. See this? - Yeah.
that's a video camera.
you'll be able to watch the whole thing when it's over.
start shooting right now.
what? - Lie down.
see you after surgery.
don't squeeze too hard.
the teeth on the forceps can leave holes.
that's good.
very good. Keep going with that plane.
great. Okay, let me take a look.
cowboys don't have friends.
Dr. Grey, you ready?
okay, good visualization, and start suturing rige.
her all right. Keep going. Very nice.
all right. Give her a little room, O'malley.
okay.
beautiful.
you can tell Dr. Yang she's a better teacher than I would've thought.
sorry. - Save it.
if your colleagues know more than you do, milk 'em for all they're worth.
but you lie to me again about your experience, and the next heart you see will be your own as I cut it out of your chest with a steak knife.
Mrs. Grandy?
your husband is in recovery.
it was a tough procedure, but overall, it went really well.
he's gonna be okay, Mrs. Grandy.
he is never gonna forgive me.
he was sick, and I told him he was lazy and boring.
he was sick. You didn't know.
well, I'm his wife. I should've known.
he was.
people are terrible to the people they love sometimes.
they're mean.
you were both going through a really hard time, and you took it out on one another.
it isn't fun, but is what people do.
that doesn't make you the worst wife in the world. It just makes you.
a person who made a mistake.
I miss anything good?
you're gonna love this. The red head just gave the short one a case because she thought he'd find it interesting-- a pyogenic granuloma.
gave it away.
we could transfer.
maybe we'd be happier.
we'd die of boredom.
we'd die with great skin.
I had the biggest derm emergency that exists toy, and it was fun for about a minute, 'cause a woman almost died, but then we saved her.
and all she needed was a stupid biopsy.
I tore a guy's face off.
I reattached a coronary artery.
I hate you both.
we are not happy, glowy people.
Yeah. - Yeah.
we gotta get out here.
Yeah. - Yeah.
still no word on the test?
George, I'm sure you passed. - It'll be okay.
I mean, you're gonna buy me a beer tonight, and then - Oh, right.
it's gonna be okay.
test results.
okay.
you passed.
I passed?
George, you're-- you're not an intern anymore.
I passed. - We are so gonna celebrate.
I passed. I passed.
I pass-- I'm gonna, uh, I gotta go tell Izzie and Meredith.
no, no, go tell 'em, and--and then we'll.
okay.
Huzzah!
to George O'malley, repeater no more.
you're gonna be impossible now.
come on and join us.
Hey, I'm gonna get a drink first.
Hey, joe. Um, could I have a beer?
sure. Want me to bring it to the table?
no, I'm--I'm just gonna sit over there.
Hey, Joe, can I get another vodka tonic?
george passed his exam.
tool.
Ah, just the people I was looking for. Joe, I want to buy these two a drink.
you are the best roommate ever.
I am. Just to be clear
you two ever pull that crap on one of my cases again, I will have you thrown out of the program.
you know what, Joe? I'll just take my drink at the table.
I-I know, okay?
I know I'm being an ass.
I can't help it. I'm pissed off all the time, so much, I can't even breathe.
but you can't be pissed at a crazy chick for losing her mind, so there's nobody else to be pissed at except you.
nobody else.
we need to have rules.
what? - Rules.
we--we need rules about how we're gonna deal with the motherland.
because it's undiscovered country and.
maybe.
maybe it'll be the best vacation either of us has ever had, but.
it's mysterious.
and dark. and there should be rules.
Oh, and--and an embassy.
and a safe word.
I'm sorry.
what the hell are you talking about?
below the.
below the mason-dixon line of your pants.
I'm not sure I'm ready to go there.
me neither.
I--w-- there's lots of undiscovered territory above the belt.
uh, we can take it slow.
maybe.
just.
first base?
okay.
okay. Thank you.
sorry.
here, finish my wine.
I'm gonna look at the menu while you let your blood pressure drop back down to normal.
maybe second base, too.
I could always move back to the trailer.
no, I want you here.
I mean, I may not always be so graceful about it, but.
I want you here.
you need a place for your things.
it's not an unreasonable request.
you can use this as your den or your office or whatever.
it's your mom's den.
but she isn't here. You are.
what about you?
you need someplace, someplace you can get away to.
well, I can always go to Cristina's or whatever.
I think I have a better idea.
we like to think we're fearless, eager to explore unknown lands and soak up new experiences but the fact is, we're always terrified.
maybe the terror is part of the attraction.
some people go to horror movies.
we cut things open, dive into dark waters.
october 13, 1977.
I haven't slept in three days.
and at the end of the day, isn't that what you'd rather hear about if you've got one drink and one friend and 45 minutes?
smooth rides make for boring stories.
a little calamity-- that's worth talking about.
I pass? - You're not an intern anymore.
george doesn't know I exist.
do you want to goon a date with me?
what if I'm not into it?
I'm not letting you do this to me, Alex. - I know I'm being an ass.
I think I found a way to save lives.
I could find patients for a clinical trial.
the tumor's shrinking. The virus is working.
you keep a diary? - it's not mine.
whose is it? - Your mother's.
I am a rock.
I am an island.
that's the mantra of pretty much every surgeon I've ever met.
we like to think we're independent, loners, mavericks...
that all we need to do our jobs is an O. R.A scalpel and a willing body.
is Yang on call tonight? - Uh, yeah.
why do you think it's so clean in here?
but the truth is, not even the best of us can do it alone.
surgery, like life, is a team sport.
can I just say, the whole "taking it slow" thing?
best idea ever.
it really takes the pressure off.
Yeah. We can just, you know, hang out without all the-- the expectations.
why rush things?
exactly.
and eventually, you've got to get off the bench and decide...
what team are you batting for?
you know, one of the joys of cohabitation is having breakfast together.
well, I can't today because bailey paged us in early.
well, I guess you don't have time to look at our work in a major medical journal.
they published our clinical trial?
it's on the cover.
a new method in treating inoperable malignant gliomas-- the Shepherd method.
what do you think?
it's a picture, a big picture of you.
you're making a face.
I'm not making a face.
I love that picture.
I have to go.
the Shepherd method.
it's about time this hospital got some good publicity for a change.
Oh, I heard you found a donor.
Yes, sir. The last piece of the puzzle finally fell into place.
this is the day, Dr. Bailey, the day that seattle grace comes back swinging.
shepherd on the front page of a national journal, bragging rights to a flashy surgery
I don't see Mercy West taking on a project of this magnitude, do you?
I'd rather wait to celebrate till we pull this thing off.
Yeah, that's a good call. We don't want to jinx it.
eat that, Mercy West.
God, I've been looking everywhere for you.
well, I had an early morning palatoplasty.
you see this?
the Shepherd method? - Yeah, yeah, very impressive.
listen, last night, Erica-- you think they airbrushed his picture?
I mean, the man does not have one damn pore.
could you focus? I need you right now.
all right, well, I'm a little exhausted, but if you want to hop on and do all the work...
no, I need to talk.
last night, Erica and I... we...
we did it. Sort of.
Congratulations. - No. No, no.
it was not good at all.
I choked.
I couldn't go down there.
I-I tried, but it justfelt so weird and clinical, like gynie rotation.
I left this morning before she got up. I couldn't even face her.
what if--what if me and Erica are-- what if--what if we were a mistake?
where are you going? - I can't talk about this.
Oh, come on. You love talking about this stuff.
girl on girl. It's hot.
two girls getting nasty and loving it?
that's hot. One girl talking about how much it sucked?
depressing and wrong.
just wrong.
the chief wants us to give george one of our interns?
except for Grey. She already lost O'malley.
just dump your dead weight.
Oh, please. They're all deadt.
that's why I need all four of them, not three.
george is filling out paperwork, getting his real live doctor wings, so I thought now would be a good time to decorate his locker.
give me that coffee. - Okay.
I don't even want the credit, but the clinical trial was my idea.
and I had to beg him to do it, more than once.
it's okay you want the credit. I would want the credit.
when you screw the attendings, you get screwed. They have all the power.
interns. You could screw interns.
I mean date.
residents could date interns,'cause we're nonthreatening.
I read this study once that said that interns hardly ever file sexual harassment claims because we feel so weak and powerless in the hospital environment, so that's good.
interns-- the other white meat.
where are we going?
you'll see when we get there.
Dr. Bailey, I'm actually on dr. Sloan's service today.
everyone's off their services. You're all with me.
where are we going? - you'll see when we get there.
Hey, did you see your locker? I put a smelly candle in it, - so now your scrubs are gonna smell like cinnamon bun. - Gosh, thanks.
Dr. Bailey, Dr. Sloan is doing a transpalatal advancement. I've never seen one.
Hahn said I could scrub in on her aortics.
I really need to get to the clinic. I've staffed it with nurses and P. A.S, but I'm the only doctor on call, and I've got administrative work to
today is not about you.
it is not about whose services you wish to be on.
it's not about your career.
this is about me.
this is a project I've been working on for a long time, and it's very important to me, therefore it will be very important to you.
and the only way we can pull this thing off is iwe work together as a team, so today, you are not 15 individual doctors, you are one team of surgeons representing this hospital.
is everybody clear othat?
um, why would they need so many doctors for one surgery? - I don't know.
because it's not just one surgery. It's 12 surgeries
6 kidney transplants in six O. R.S, all at themeame ti.
paired matching kidney donation.
a 6-way swap-- 6 people donate kidneys to total strangers, six people get kidneys from total strangers.
12 people walk away happy.
paired matching kidney donation.
otherwise known as - dude, a domino surgery.
Stan Mercer, 46, chronic renal failure secondary to high blood pressure.
his wife here wanted to donate a kidney to him, but she wasn't a match.
so she will be donating her kidney to ms. Chen over there, who is a match, while mr. Mercer will be getting a kidney from this young man today.
nice to meet you.
P. J.Please.
uh, Kurt Walling, 58, chronic renal failure secondary to diabetes.
his son P. J. Wasn't a match, so Mr. Walling will be getting Ms. Herman's kidney today.
thanks for the kidney, Ms. Herman. - Oh, call me lindsay.
we're gonna be pretty close by the end of the day.
and so on and so forth. Why do you still look stupid?
well, maybe if we had a cheat sheet.
ms. Herman gives her kidney to Mr. Walling.
Mr. Walling's son gives his kidney to Mr. Mercer.
Mr. Mercer's wife gives her kidney to Ms. Chen.
ms. Chen's sister gives her kidney to Mr. Patel.
Mr. Patel's wife gives her kidney to Ms. Loring, who came in with her cousin, Ms. Gomez, who's giving her kidney to Mr. Cross, the professional flautist.
for those of you without a photographic memory, it's up on a board in the conference room.
and why do we have to do all x transplants at one time?
so no one backs out at the last minute.
why would anybody back out? It's such an incredible thing to be a part of.
well, passing the organ's kinda creepy. I'd back out.
Yeah, yeah, that's why this whole surgery is a giant house of cards.
if we lose one donor, we lose them all.
so you will not only provide excellent medical care, but you will keep your patients happy.
we need to make sure this whole thing doesn't fall apart before the surgery.
any questions?
um, I heard when the did a domino at boston gen, the residents all got to keep one of the dead kidneys in a jar aa souvenir.
I want a kidney in a jar. - Me, too, can I have a kidney?
well, if they get kidneys, I get a kidney.
quantities are limited. I asked first. Can we?
no one is taking home a kidney in a jar.
diseased kidneys are not tchotchkes for your coffee table.
now go. Go.
Hey, you okay?
uh, Bailey snagged all the surgical residents and interns, so I'm stuck with the psych interns.
not the sharpest. - Okay, you're busy.
I'll be brief. I was thinking, if you weren't on call tonight, that, uh, maybe we could, uh, go to my place, order in dinner, rent a movie.
tonight? You want to get together again tonight?
well, I had a lot of fun last night.
fun.
anyway, just let me know.
okay, as you may know, one of you is going to O'malley today.
Oh, me! I-I'll go if you need a volunteer.
I decide who gets to go after I decide which one of you sucks the most.
and you better not suck on purpose, because I will know.
honey, would you like your book or some music, something to help you relax?
I don't know. Maybe some water. - How about some ice chips instead?
your ankles are looking a little thick.
my wife loves tracking my fluid retention.
and, Megan, will you please come over here and tape the needles so we n start dialis?
sounds just like a real doctor.
uh, it says here that you don't have a loved one in the domino, ms. Herman. - No.
so you're just donating a kidney to a complete stranger for nothing in return?
it's really no big deal.
I have two kidneys, and they say you can live with one, so... - are you kidding?
that's amazing, what you're doing.
u. N.O. S.Is always short on organs.
if everyone in the world did this - yeah, it'd be all peace and love and unicorns.
she gets it, Grey.
I'm so sick of all the "yay, you." - I totally understand.
the chief has got me doing press all day with journalists.
my face is starting to hurt from smiling.
I already pushed that.
it comes faster when I push it.
Oh, must be that shepherd method.
funny.
I think I'll take the stairs. - Meredith, are you bothered by this?
why would I be bothered?
you can't call it the shepherd-grey method because then people would ink you had help.
so do I rely have to give my kidney to that old guy?
Mr. Mercer couldn't be more than 50.
my son's to him, everyone over 40 is on the brink of death.
turned 23 in august.
Oh, that's right.
maybe we could have a little belated party here in the hospital, get you an ice cream cake.
you used to love those. - Yeah, when I was 7.
look, I'm not here for a reunion.
I just want to get this over with and get out of here, okay?
so you are on dialysis four times a week now?
they might as well chain me to the machine at this point.
my kidneys are shot.
I'm living on borrowed time.
so I'm pretty lucky to have a son who would do this for me.
you're lucky you're loaded.
so when do I get the 10, 000 bucks, before or after the surgery?
it's a christmas gift.
well, it's October.
I see you two hovering.
hypothetically, say a patient was... paying his son for a kidney, what exactly would happen?
paying money for a kidney?
hypothetically.
well, as someone who stole an organ herself not that long ago, you should know, what would happen is your patient would be out of the exchange.
which means that this person, since her husband's no longer getting a kidney, would drop out.
then they would drop out, then they would drop out, then the whole thing would fall apart.
that's what would happen.
so if you both are suggesting that that's what's going on here, you'd better be damn sure about it.
it's just a gift.
uh, an early stocking stuffer.
most girls your age, they're busy shopping.
you're in the hospital giving a kidney to a stranger.
Oh, I'm not such a saint.
your kidney may not be going directly to my husband, but you're one of the people saving his life today.
to me, your mother teresa.
honey, would you mind running and getting a wet washcloth for me?
I'm just - oh, yeah, of course. Excuse me.
thank you.
you know, my mother invented the Grey method all by herself.
you know, maybe you should stop reading her diary.
it's gonna make you feel inadequate.
she's dead and in the past and still outpacing me.
okay, see, see that intern over there?
is he clean?
what? Well, I was just thinking, what Lexopedia said, and, you know, she may be on to something.
you're gonna sleep with an intern?
it'd just be scratching the itch.
it's been a long time.
I can't do this.
all these people telling me how wonderful and selfless and giving I am
I-I can take it anymore, especially not from her.
all right, just keep your voice down.
did you see her face, thanking me for saving your life?
Stan, this is crazy. You promised you would tell her. Please!
Mr. Mercer, is everything okay?
no, I don't feel so good, actually. - Tell her!
if the past three years have meant anything to you, you have to tell her!
I'm not an idiot. I know there have been other women.
all these years, I told myself it was just sex.
it's just... my god, Stan.
she's giving a kidney for you. That--that's not sex.
it's family. - All right, his, uh, cardiac enzymes and E. K.G.
look good. He had an acute anxiety attack.
I can clear him for surgery.
I do everything for you.
I've given up my entire life to get you to dialysis, drive you to the doctors
I didn't ask you to do any of that.
I can drive a car.
I can pour my own juice.
I got sick, not elderly.
well, don't worry.
I won't do one more thing for you, and that includes giving a kidney.
get on the phone with U. N.O. S. - Tell them we need a kidney that matches Mrs. Mercer's antibodies.
u. N.O. S.Is a long shot. - It's the only shot we have. Now go, now.
she's barely a second-year resident. I made the virus.
she assisted. When Michael Jordan scores, no one cares about the assist.
I don't know. Scottie Pippen... - you know what I mean.
these women, they overthink everything.
somebody's cranky today.
what is that?"Experimental treatments for cleft palates.
you're working on your own clinical trial, aren't you?
I'm--I'm jt-- I'm doing a little research.
see, the very sight of me reminds you that you've not made one worthwhile contribution to medical history, doesn't it?
get out. - You should read my article.
it will enrich your life, make you a better man.
I'm saving it for the bathroom.
it started as an office thing, you know, light, fun.
and then one day you wake up, and... this older guy is all you can think about.
you'd do anything for him, even give a kidney.
Why?
I could save his life, too.
I mean, she may be married to him, but... I'm saving his life today, too.
so then he'll finally have to choose.
her or me?
apparently, Erica loved it, the non-sex sex.
I think she might want more.
happens to me all the time with women. I barely remember it, their minds are blown.
that's your sage advice?
I'm a world-class surgeon, double boarded in plastics and E. N.T.
I have more meaningful and worthwhile things to do than dispense sex advice.
Yeah, like what?
nice. - Oh, come on.
no, Mark, I need your help.
excuse me.
what is going on?
trying to decide which of our interns to give to Georg in front of us.
they're deciding in front of us, like livestock at a state fair.
I think I'll keep Lexopedia.
she remembers many things.
and she bathes, which is much more than I can say for... stinky two over there. you smell.
well, Graciella charts like crap.
but she can put in a line.
Claire, on the htherand, nearly castrated a guy with a catheter.
we can hear you.
I might dump pierce. - Ooh, how does he suck?
I just hate saying the name Pierce.
we should revolt.
they'd respect us more if we didn't participate in our own humiliation.
Yeah.
you revolt first, and I'll follow.
Hey, have you heardfrom U. N.O. S.Yet?
they're still searching for a match. But so far, nothing.
I hope they come through. My guy really needs a kidney.
Yeah, they all need kidneys, Izzie.
if Derek needed a kidney, I wouldn't give him one. He'd take the credit.
he'd say he magically grew it himself.
my guy's been sick for 15 years.
can you imagine having your life on hold like that?
Plus, he's got such a crappy kid.
Hey! Did I say you could put that down?
no, so pick it up. Weak.
no stamina. - Yeah, but he takes orders.
true. True.
is my husband getting a kidney or not? Wait, what about my sister?
if she's not getting a kidney today, am not giving mine to some stranger.
I will do my best to make sure everyone gets a kidney today.
I'll update you as soon as I have information. Please.
sir, I--I've got this under control.
I have Grey talking with U. N.O. S.I have
we are being featured on the national news.
all eyes are on seattle grace.
fix this. - Yes, sir.
I have been poked and prodded like a lab rat, what, all for nothing?
we got to spend time with each other.
that's not nothing.
Oh, oh, now you want to spend time together?
well, you're about 20 years too late.
so, yeah, nothing. - P. J...
do I still get the $10, 000 if the surgery doesn't happen?
cause if not, I'm outta here.
I have a life to get back to. - Please.
I need you.
if you could... just be patient a little bit longer...
I was gonna punch that kid. I mean, what kind of a selfish idiot-- his father is sick, he's really sick, and all he cares aboutis his stupid money.
all right, the guy must have done something really bad to make the kid so angry.
maybe he just cares about his son, but the moron is too emotionally stunted to let him.
okay, uh, I'm--I'm-- I'm trying to be, uh...
I am, but this right here?
this--this-- this is exactly your problem.
you get all wrapped up and involved and you just
you start--you start caring about these people.
your patient in there, he's the moron.
his son's never gonna give him what he wants, and he's just gonna be disappointed.
and the sooner he gets that, the sooner you get it...
no, go on, please.
be a selfish ass. Cause at least then I know what to expect.
cause this being a decent guy one second and a total jerk the next, it's getting really old, alex.
so who's it gonna be? Pick one.
O'malley. Sup, bud? it's doctor.
missed you at lunch today. It was an all-new level of hell.
Oh, no, I was busy doing my own charts.
the internsdon't respect me.
I would respect you if I was your intern.
George, they don't respect you because they're not scared of you.
just decimate one every few days.
it's not rocket science. Two.
who's getting, uh, Ms. Herman's kidney?
uh, I can-- I can go check.
three? - Mr. Walling.
that's right. No. I totally forgot.
you forgot.
like you forgot to do your notes before rounds?
or like you forgot to pull the drain on my post-op S. B.O?
or like you forgot to sign all your dictation, so all your charts
uh, my charts--are delinquent?
you forgot... because the only thing you can retain in that pea-sized brain of yours is what time lunch is.
grey here is gonna become a surgeon while you dig ditches by the side of the road.
it's brutal, but it's effective.
I am not gonna do this with you. - Do what?
have this silent fight.
I'm gonna write the editors and have them print a correction-- the Shepherd-Grey method.
I don't want you to give me credit because you're mad that I'm mad.
I want you to give me credit because you think I worked hard for it and I deserve it.
you don't deserve it.
you're a baby.
you have the potential to be a good surgeon, maybe a great one.
but you haven't even scratched the surface on what you need to learn.
it was my idea.
and I hate that picture.
any available I. V. Nurse to the E. R. U. N.O. S.
u. N.O. S.Doesn't have a match.
okay.
uh, we can, um... we've been stalling. We haven't released anyone.
I can talk to Ms. Mercer
you can't do anything that could be seen as coercion.
u. N.O. S. Is very clear. -But, sir
the last thi we need is to lose our status as a transplant center.
let the patients go home.
I've got a cabg in an hour. Want to get some coffee?
I'm not cut out for this. -Coffee?
no, this, the--the touching and the... sex with a girl. I just--I-I can't do it.
I thought I could but...
but you did do it. I don't understand.
it wasn't good for you.
I can't believe it.
I got so close.
you're gonna be pretty high on the transplant list. Something else will come up.
it's not the kidney I'm upset about.
your son.
we hadn'spoken in over a year.
it took me months to find him.
this was my chance to get him back. -Right.
I know P. J. can be selfish... rude...
but it hasn't been easy for him.
his mom died.
I worked late most nights.
I made a lot of mistakes.
you can't blame yourself.
some people are just broken.
I guess you just try not to care too much.
then you can't be disappointed.
these are, uh, your discharge papers.
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I'm...
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
it's okay.
now all you have to do is sign there at the bottom, and you're free to go.
you must think I'm a terrible person... refusing to give my kidney.
we're not thinking anything, ma'am.
he's taken everything.
my love, my pride, my dignity-- it's all gone.
but the one thing that he doesn't have is the kidney.
and the thought of giving him that last part of me...
you must think I'm a terrible person.
I'm not allowed to think anything.
there are rules that prevent me from having an opinion here
good rules, rules in place for a reason
because giving an organ that god put in your body to someone else isn't something that you can be coerced into doing.
it is... a big thing.
it is an extraordinary thing.
it's a gift that must be freely given.
and if you were to give it, and I'm not asking you to, but if you were to give it, it's not just for your husband.
it's for five other people, people that you don't know from Adam.
our six donors are all anesthetized and ready to go.
they'll be done first, followed by the recipients.
each pair will be color-coded so as not to confuse them.
this surgery is a hornet's nest, people, so work quickly but carefully.
use each other. Operate as a team.
let's go make medical history.
we're lucky as hell that woman changed her mind.
Yes, we are. Yes, we are.
now that's what I call a nice-looking kidney.
put that on ice and start flushing in the preservation solution.
you want to do the honors, dr. Yang?
good.
that's quite a geyser of urine, sir.
that means we did our job right. You never get tired of seeing that.
we're ready for you, Grey.
walking with the kidney.
5-second rule! 5-second rule!
uh, hold it still, boki.
I'm gonna need more ice, uh, and another tie.
I'll get it. -No, you don't touc anything else.
someone dropped a damn kidney?
I know you don't want to talk about it anymore. I know you're over it.
Oh, for the love of god. -Just hear me out.
I like to be good at things, okay?
I do not fail. I do not quit.
I like to be good at things, and I want to be good at this.
so... I need you.
I need you to show me.
show you?
just because you didn't publish a big clinical trial doesn't mean you're not a genius.
fine. Take off your pants.
Really?
Oh, my god. Thank you.
thank you so much.
I'll show you the Sloan method.
won't ever be in a medical journal, but it should.
shouldn't it be pinking up by now?
it's just getting venous blood.
let's check the back side again.
I don't know. I think I see... a little pink, maybe.
Ah, come on, come on.
all right.
come on.
come on, pink up.
come on.
pink up, pink up, pink up, pink up.
come on.
Yes. Yeah, it looks good.
we have a live kidney.
Oh, come on. I am offering two interns.
two interns for the price of one--come on.
I'll trade you laura for both of 'em.
Leo drains pus and likes it.
I dropped an internal organ... on the floor.
it happens. -Okay, okay.
uh, how about this?
four goes to George. I get James.
Karev, you get two. Izzie, give Leo.
what are you people doing?
we were just, uh, just deciding which of our interns to give to George.
Oh, you think I got to choose my interns, and I picked you people 'cause you're all such a surgical dream team?
you--you're lazy. You're whiny.
butterfingers overhere is downright depressing, and you, yang, you-- you're just annoying.
choosing their own interns... what are
what... give me those damn cards.
O'malley... you have interns.
what is it?
okay, open his fluids. Karev, push a gram of Mag.
do a C. B.C. And electrolytes.
Stevens, uh, order a color flow doppler and do a full neuro workup.
you think there's a bleed?
there's no way of knowing till we evaluate everything.
where is... P. J? Where's my son?
Stan had better be dead right now.
he's doing fine.
he hasn't called my room.
just lay back.
he hasn't asked for me.
it's been three years.
I gave a kidney for him, and he still hasn't made a choice.
he hasn't asked about you or called.
I think he's made a choice.
but I gave a kidney for him.
I gave a kidney.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Hey, man, the nurse was supposed to bring my dinner like an hour ago.
your dad just had a seizure.
okay.
so what does that mean?
it means something's wrong.
it means he could be dying, and he doesn't know you give a crap.
honestly, he doesn't know, and maybe you don't, but if you do, he's dying, and you're gonna be too late.
Alex, stop.
he's asking for you, and you're gonna be too late, and you're gonna live with it for the rest of your life!
you really want to live with that, huh?
do you? -Alex! Alex.
so tomorrow we'll meet, uh, one hour before pre-rounds.
dude, that's, like, 4:00 A. M.
Dr. Stevens never made us come in before pre-rounds.
Yeah, O'malley, you gotta chill.
they probably should say dr. O'malley.
so those are your interns?
did you even ask for me? -What?
I helped you study.
I helped decorate your stupid locker.
I-nd you didn't-- you don't-- you don't even see it.
you don't see anything.
I am such an idiot.
and you are a jerk.
you didn't even think to ask for me?
screw you, Dr. O'malley.
ms. Loring and Mr. Mercer, they're all stable.
but Mr. Walling, he has delayed graft function and god knows what else.
Ah, the press is gonna be all over this tomorrow.
and I'll need you available for interviews and some photo-ops.
make sure you wear your nice scrubs.
did you hear me, sir? Mr. Walling--he has a serious complication.
his electrolytes are off, his crit's down.
but you saved five other lives.
that's a pretty good scorecard. Not perfect, but good.
I told you. I don't want to see Stan.
I'm not taking you to see Stan.
Oh, this is her. This is the woman who gave me her kidney.
how's she doing?
I'm keeping a close eye on her, but so far, she's completely stable.
come with me.
this man is very ill, maybe dying.
he's got a perfect, healthy donor kidney that wasn't dropped on the floor.
there's only so much we can help... and so much we can hurt.
forgive yourself.
visiting hours are over.
it's okay.
your urine output is up to 25 cc's pr. Hou that should make you happy.
my wife would've been happy.
who's gonna care about my urine output now?
well, things are gonna be a little different.
Ah, Dr. Bailey. I heard your big surgery went well today.
Congratulations. -Same to you.
must feel good to see your name in print like that.
it would feel better if Meredith wasn't so
you know, she's acting silly about the credit. She's getting emotional.
that girl worked her ass off for you, and you got all the credit.
I would've gotten all the blame had we failed. -But you didn't fail.
it's simple. I'm an attending. She's a second-year resident.
who you're now living with. That's not simple. It's messy.
if it were me, I'd start with "thank you.
you'd be surprised how far that one goes, especially with us silly, emotional women.
so Derek said that I was a baby. -What?
and that I had a lot to learn.
whatever.
I mean, not whatever. He's right.
I did drop a kidney. And don't say it happens, because it doesn't.
but I do hate it when he's right.
no, okay, he is not right.
stop caring so much about what he thinks. It makes you seem desperate.
okay, to the one trolling for interns.
Yeah, I changed my mind.
interns are weak. I don't want weak.
you know, Burke was a man.
he was a man.
I think, uh, we need another round.
Hey, Joe. How you doing?
excuse me.
here you go.
Wh--ho-- is this for me? -Yes.
Hey, honey. I brought you roses. Let me back in the house.
Oh, no. -Yes.
holy crap. What the hell is that thing?
Oh, that is a kidney in a jar.
that's not fair. How did you get that?
well, being an incredibly important, fancy neurosurgeon has its perks.
thank you.
I couldn't have done it without you, not one surgery, not one patient.
I couldn't have done any of it without you. Thanks.
Yeah, could you guys go ahead and get this thing the hell out of here before people start to freak out?
okay. -okay.
um, are you gonna be okay? -Yeah, yeah, go ahead.
all right. Good night.
good night. -Good night, Joe.
the thing about choosing teams in real life, it's nothing like it used to be in gym class.
being first pick can be terrifying.
take off your pants.
excuse me? -Take off... your pants.
we're trying this again.
and being chosen last... isn't the worst thing in the world.
what?
I care about you.
I care about you, and I'm not gonna go crazy, and I'm not nna try to kill myself, and I'm not gonna stop caring about you, no matter how hard you push me away.
shut up and get out of my room. -No.
I care about you.
and I know you care about me, too. It is not too late for us.
get out of my room. -Admit it.
admit that you care about me, too. I know you do, and I care about you.
I care about you.
I care about you. I care about you.
I care about you.
I-- so we watch from the sidelines, clinging to our isolation...
it glows. -Yeah.
when my mother was a resident, she wasn't dropping kidneys.
you're reading your mom's diary? -Yeah.
I'm not half the surgeon my mother was.
because we know as soon as we let go of the bench...
what, are you leaving already?
there are no real men left in the world, Joe.
see you. -Yeah.
Hey, shot and a beer. Uh, Whiskey.
you know what? Better make it just the beer. I start work tomorrow.
someone comes along and changes the game completely.
I pass? - You're not an intern anymore.
george doesn't know I exist.
do you want to goon a date with me?
what if I'm not into it?
I'm not letting you do this to me, Alex. - I know I'm being an ass.
I think I found a way to save lives.
I could find patients for a clinical trial.
the tumor's shrinking. The virus is working.
you keep a diary? - it's not mine.
whose is it? - Your mother's.
I am a rock.
I am an island.
that's the mantra of pretty much every surgeon I've ever met.
we like to think we're independent, loners, mavericks...
that all we need to do our jobs is an O. R.A scalpel and a willing body.
is Yang on call tonight? - Uh, yeah.
why do you think it's so clean in here?
but the truth is, not even the best of us can do it alone.
surgery, like life, is a team sport.
can I just say, the whole "taking it slow" thing?
best idea ever.
it really takes the pressure off.
Yeah. We can just, you know, hang out without all the-- the expectations.
why rush things?
exactly.
and eventually, you've got to get off the bench and decide...
what team are you batting for?
you know, one of the joys of cohabitation is having breakfast together.
well, I can't today because bailey paged us in early.
well, I guess you don't have time to look at our work in a major medical journal.
they published our clinical trial?
it's on the cover.
a new method in treating inoperable malignant gliomas-- the Shepherd method.
what do you think?
it's a picture, a big picture of you.
you're making a face.
I'm not making a face.
I love that picture.
I have to go.
the Shepherd method.
it's about time this hospital got some good publicity for a change.
Oh, I heard you found a donor.
Yes, sir. The last piece of the puzzle finally fell into place.
this is the day, Dr. Bailey, the day that seattle grace comes back swinging.
shepherd on the front page of a national journal, bragging rights to a flashy surgery
I don't see Mercy West taking on a project of this magnitude, do you?
I'd rather wait to celebrate till we pull this thing off.
Yeah, that's a good call. We don't want to jinx it.
eat that, Mercy West.
God, I've been looking everywhere for you.
well, I had an early morning palatoplasty.
you see this?
the Shepherd method? - Yeah, yeah, very impressive.
listen, last night, Erica-- you think they airbrushed his picture?
I mean, the man does not have one damn pore.
could you focus? I need you right now.
all right, well, I'm a little exhausted, but if you want to hop on and do all the work...
no, I need to talk.
last night, Erica and I... we...
we did it. Sort of.
Congratulations. - No. No, no.
it was not good at all.
I choked.
I couldn't go down there.
I-I tried, but it justfelt so weird and clinical, like gynie rotation.
I left this morning before she got up. I couldn't even face her.
what if--what if me and Erica are-- what if--what if we were a mistake?
where are you going? - I can't talk about this.
Oh, come on. You love talking about this stuff.
girl on girl. It's hot.
two girls getting nasty and loving it?
that's hot. One girl talking about how much it sucked?
depressing and wrong.
just wrong.
the chief wants us to give george one of our interns?
except for Grey. She already lost O'malley.
just dump your dead weight.
Oh, please. They're all deadt.
that's why I need all four of them, not three.
george is filling out paperwork, getting his real live doctor wings, so I thought now would be a good time to decorate his locker.
give me that coffee. - Okay.
I don't even want the credit, but the clinical trial was my idea.
and I had to beg him to do it, more than once.
it's okay you want the credit. I would want the credit.
when you screw the attendings, you get screwed. They have all the power.
interns. You could screw interns.
I mean date.
residents could date interns,'cause we're nonthreatening.
I read this study once that said that interns hardly ever file sexual harassment claims because we feel so weak and powerless in the hospital environment, so that's good.
interns-- the other white meat.
where are we going?
you'll see when we get there.
Dr. Bailey, I'm actually on dr. Sloan's service today.
everyone's off their services. You're all with me.
where are we going? - you'll see when we get there.
Hey, did you see your locker? I put a smelly candle in it, - so now your scrubs are gonna smell like cinnamon bun. - Gosh, thanks.
Dr. Bailey, Dr. Sloan is doing a transpalatal advancement. I've never seen one.
Hahn said I could scrub in on her aortics.
I really need to get to the clinic. I've staffed it with nurses and P. A.S, but I'm the only doctor on call, and I've got administrative work to
today is not about you.
it is not about whose services you wish to be on.
it's not about your career.
this is about me.
this is a project I've been working on for a long time, and it's very important to me, therefore it will be very important to you.
and the only way we can pull this thing off is iwe work together as a team, so today, you are not 15 individual doctors, you are one team of surgeons representing this hospital.
is everybody clear othat?
um, why would they need so many doctors for one surgery? - I don't know.
because it's not just one surgery. It's 12 surgeries
6 kidney transplants in six O. R.S, all at themeame ti.
paired matching kidney donation.
a 6-way swap-- 6 people donate kidneys to total strangers, six people get kidneys from total strangers.
12 people walk away happy.
paired matching kidney donation.
otherwise known as - dude, a domino surgery.
Stan Mercer, 46, chronic renal failure secondary to high blood pressure.
his wife here wanted to donate a kidney to him, but she wasn't a match.
so she will be donating her kidney to ms. Chen over there, who is a match, while mr. Mercer will be getting a kidney from this young man today.
nice to meet you.
P. J.Please.
uh, Kurt Walling, 58, chronic renal failure secondary to diabetes.
his son P. J. Wasn't a match, so Mr. Walling will be getting Ms. Herman's kidney today.
thanks for the kidney, Ms. Herman. - Oh, call me lindsay.
we're gonna be pretty close by the end of the day.
and so on and so forth. Why do you still look stupid?
well, maybe if we had a cheat sheet.
ms. Herman gives her kidney to Mr. Walling.
Mr. Walling's son gives his kidney to Mr. Mercer.
Mr. Mercer's wife gives her kidney to Ms. Chen.
ms. Chen's sister gives her kidney to Mr. Patel.
Mr. Patel's wife gives her kidney to Ms. Loring, who came in with her cousin, Ms. Gomez, who's giving her kidney to Mr. Cross, the professional flautist.
for those of you without a photographic memory, it's up on a board in the conference room.
and why do we have to do all x transplants at one time?
so no one backs out at the last minute.
why would anybody back out? It's such an incredible thing to be a part of.
well, passing the organ's kinda creepy. I'd back out.
Yeah, yeah, that's why this whole surgery is a giant house of cards.
if we lose one donor, we lose them all.
so you will not only provide excellent medical care, but you will keep your patients happy.
we need to make sure this whole thing doesn't fall apart before the surgery.
any questions?
um, I heard when the did a domino at boston gen, the residents all got to keep one of the dead kidneys in a jar aa souvenir.
I want a kidney in a jar. - Me, too, can I have a kidney?
well, if they get kidneys, I get a kidney.
quantities are limited. I asked first. Can we?
no one is taking home a kidney in a jar.
diseased kidneys are not tchotchkes for your coffee table.
now go. Go.
Hey, you okay?
uh, Bailey snagged all the surgical residents and interns, so I'm stuck with the psych interns.
not the sharpest. - Okay, you're busy.
I'll be brief. I was thinking, if you weren't on call tonight, that, uh, maybe we could, uh, go to my place, order in dinner, rent a movie.
tonight? You want to get together again tonight?
well, I had a lot of fun last night.
fun.
anyway, just let me know.
okay, as you may know, one of you is going to O'malley today.
Oh, me! I-I'll go if you need a volunteer.
I decide who gets to go after I decide which one of you sucks the most.
and you better not suck on purpose, because I will know.
honey, would you like your book or some music, something to help you relax?
I don't know. Maybe some water. - How about some ice chips instead?
your ankles are looking a little thick.
my wife loves tracking my fluid retention.
and, Megan, will you please come over here and tape the needles so we n start dialis?
sounds just like a real doctor.
uh, it says here that you don't have a loved one in the domino, ms. Herman. - No.
so you're just donating a kidney to a complete stranger for nothing in return?
it's really no big deal.
I have two kidneys, and they say you can live with one, so... - are you kidding?
that's amazing, what you're doing.
u. N.O. S.Is always short on organs.
if everyone in the world did this - yeah, it'd be all peace and love and unicorns.
she gets it, Grey.
I'm so sick of all the "yay, you." - I totally understand.
the chief has got me doing press all day with journalists.
my face is starting to hurt from smiling.
I already pushed that.
it comes faster when I push it.
Oh, must be that shepherd method.
funny.
I think I'll take the stairs. - Meredith, are you bothered by this?
why would I be bothered?
you can't call it the shepherd-grey method because then people would ink you had help.
so do I rely have to give my kidney to that old guy?
Mr. Mercer couldn't be more than 50.
my son's to him, everyone over 40 is on the brink of death.
turned 23 in august.
Oh, that's right.
maybe we could have a little belated party here in the hospital, get you an ice cream cake.
you used to love those. - Yeah, when I was 7.
look, I'm not here for a reunion.
I just want to get this over with and get out of here, okay?
so you are on dialysis four times a week now?
they might as well chain me to the machine at this point.
my kidneys are shot.
I'm living on borrowed time.
so I'm pretty lucky to have a son who would do this for me.
you're lucky you're loaded.
so when do I get the 10, 000 bucks, before or after the surgery?
it's a christmas gift.
well, it's October.
I see you two hovering.
hypothetically, say a patient was... paying his son for a kidney, what exactly would happen?
paying money for a kidney?
hypothetically.
well, as someone who stole an organ herself not that long ago, you should know, what would happen is your patient would be out of the exchange.
which means that this person, since her husband's no longer getting a kidney, would drop out.
then they would drop out, then they would drop out, then the whole thing would fall apart.
that's what would happen.
so if you both are suggesting that that's what's going on here, you'd better be damn sure about it.
it's just a gift.
uh, an early stocking stuffer.
most girls your age, they're busy shopping.
you're in the hospital giving a kidney to a stranger.
Oh, I'm not such a saint.
your kidney may not be going directly to my husband, but you're one of the people saving his life today.
to me, your mother teresa.
honey, would you mind running and getting a wet washcloth for me?
I'm just - oh, yeah, of course. Excuse me.
thank you.
you know, my mother invented the Grey method all by herself.
you know, maybe you should stop reading her diary.
it's gonna make you feel inadequate.
she's dead and in the past and still outpacing me.
okay, see, see that intern over there?
is he clean?
what? Well, I was just thinking, what Lexopedia said, and, you know, she may be on to something.
you're gonna sleep with an intern?
it'd just be scratching the itch.
it's been a long time.
I can't do this.
all these people telling me how wonderful and selfless and giving I am
I-I can take it anymore, especially not from her.
all right, just keep your voice down.
did you see her face, thanking me for saving your life?
Stan, this is crazy. You promised you would tell her. Please!
Mr. Mercer, is everything okay?
no, I don't feel so good, actually. - Tell her!
if the past three years have meant anything to you, you have to tell her!
I'm not an idiot. I know there have been other women.
all these years, I told myself it was just sex.
it's just... my god, Stan.
she's giving a kidney for you. That--that's not sex.
it's family. - All right, his, uh, cardiac enzymes and E. K.G.
look good. He had an acute anxiety attack.
I can clear him for surgery.
I do everything for you.
I've given up my entire life to get you to dialysis, drive you to the doctors
I didn't ask you to do any of that.
I can drive a car.
I can pour my own juice.
I got sick, not elderly.
well, don't worry.
I won't do one more thing for you, and that includes giving a kidney.
get on the phone with U. N.O. S. - Tell them we need a kidney that matches Mrs. Mercer's antibodies.
u. N.O. S.Is a long shot. - It's the only shot we have. Now go, now.
she's barely a second-year resident. I made the virus.
she assisted. When Michael Jordan scores, no one cares about the assist.
I don't know. Scottie Pippen... - you know what I mean.
these women, they overthink everything.
somebody's cranky today.
what is that?"Experimental treatments for cleft palates.
you're working on your own clinical trial, aren't you?
I'm--I'm jt-- I'm doing a little research.
see, the very sight of me reminds you that you've not made one worthwhile contribution to medical history, doesn't it?
get out. - You should read my article.
it will enrich your life, make you a better man.
I'm saving it for the bathroom.
it started as an office thing, you know, light, fun.
and then one day you wake up, and... this older guy is all you can think about.
you'd do anything for him, even give a kidney.
Why?
I could save his life, too.
I mean, she may be married to him, but... I'm saving his life today, too.
so then he'll finally have to choose.
her or me?
apparently, Erica loved it, the non-sex sex.
I think she might want more.
happens to me all the time with women. I barely remember it, their minds are blown.
that's your sage advice?
I'm a world-class surgeon, double boarded in plastics and E. N.T.
I have more meaningful and worthwhile things to do than dispense sex advice.
Yeah, like what?
nice. - Oh, come on.
no, Mark, I need your help.
excuse me.
what is going on?
trying to decide which of our interns to give to Georg in front of us.
they're deciding in front of us, like livestock at a state fair.
I think I'll keep Lexopedia.
she remembers many things.
and she bathes, which is much more than I can say for... stinky two over there. you smell.
well, Graciella charts like crap.
but she can put in a line.
Claire, on the htherand, nearly castrated a guy with a catheter.
we can hear you.
I might dump pierce. - Ooh, how does he suck?
I just hate saying the name Pierce.
we should revolt.
they'd respect us more if we didn't participate in our own humiliation.
Yeah.
you revolt first, and I'll follow.
Hey, have you heardfrom U. N.O. S.Yet?
they're still searching for a match. But so far, nothing.
I hope they come through. My guy really needs a kidney.
Yeah, they all need kidneys, Izzie.
if Derek needed a kidney, I wouldn't give him one. He'd take the credit.
he'd say he magically grew it himself.
my guy's been sick for 15 years.
can you imagine having your life on hold like that?
Plus, he's got such a crappy kid.
Hey! Did I say you could put that down?
no, so pick it up. Weak.
no stamina. - Yeah, but he takes orders.
true. True.
is my husband getting a kidney or not? Wait, what about my sister?
if she's not getting a kidney today, am not giving mine to some stranger.
I will do my best to make sure everyone gets a kidney today.
I'll update you as soon as I have information. Please.
sir, I--I've got this under control.
I have Grey talking with U. N.O. S.I have
we are being featured on the national news.
all eyes are on seattle grace.
fix this. - Yes, sir.
I have been poked and prodded like a lab rat, what, all for nothing?
we got to spend time with each other.
that's not nothing.
Oh, oh, now you want to spend time together?
well, you're about 20 years too late.
so, yeah, nothing. - P. J...
do I still get the $10, 000 if the surgery doesn't happen?
cause if not, I'm outta here.
I have a life to get back to. - Please.
I need you.
if you could... just be patient a little bit longer...
I was gonna punch that kid. I mean, what kind of a selfish idiot-- his father is sick, he's really sick, and all he cares aboutis his stupid money.
all right, the guy must have done something really bad to make the kid so angry.
maybe he just cares about his son, but the moron is too emotionally stunted to let him.
okay, uh, I'm--I'm-- I'm trying to be, uh...
I am, but this right here?
this--this-- this is exactly your problem.
you get all wrapped up and involved and you just
you start--you start caring about these people.
your patient in there, he's the moron.
his son's never gonna give him what he wants, and he's just gonna be disappointed.
and the sooner he gets that, the sooner you get it...
no, go on, please.
be a selfish ass. Cause at least then I know what to expect.
cause this being a decent guy one second and a total jerk the next, it's getting really old, alex.
so who's it gonna be? Pick one.
O'malley. Sup, bud? it's doctor.
missed you at lunch today. It was an all-new level of hell.
Oh, no, I was busy doing my own charts.
the internsdon't respect me.
I would respect you if I was your intern.
George, they don't respect you because they're not scared of you.
just decimate one every few days.
it's not rocket science. Two.
who's getting, uh, Ms. Herman's kidney?
uh, I can-- I can go check.
three? - Mr. Walling.
that's right. No. I totally forgot.
you forgot.
like you forgot to do your notes before rounds?
or like you forgot to pull the drain on my post-op S. B.O?
or like you forgot to sign all your dictation, so all your charts
uh, my charts--are delinquent?
you forgot... because the only thing you can retain in that pea-sized brain of yours is what time lunch is.
grey here is gonna become a surgeon while you dig ditches by the side of the road.
it's brutal, but it's effective.
I am not gonna do this with you. - Do what?
have this silent fight.
I'm gonna write the editors and have them print a correction-- the Shepherd-Grey method.
I don't want you to give me credit because you're mad that I'm mad.
I want you to give me credit because you think I worked hard for it and I deserve it.
you don't deserve it.
you're a baby.
you have the potential to be a good surgeon, maybe a great one.
but you haven't even scratched the surface on what you need to learn.
it was my idea.
and I hate that picture.
any available I. V. Nurse to the E. R. U. N.O. S.
u. N.O. S.Doesn't have a match.
okay.
uh, we can, um... we've been stalling. We haven't released anyone.
I can talk to Ms. Mercer
you can't do anything that could be seen as coercion.
u. N.O. S. Is very clear. -But, sir
the last thi we need is to lose our status as a transplant center.
let the patients go home.
I've got a cabg in an hour. Want to get some coffee?
I'm not cut out for this. -Coffee?
no, this, the--the touching and the... sex with a girl. I just--I-I can't do it.
I thought I could but...
but you did do it. I don't understand.
it wasn't good for you.
I can't believe it.
I got so close.
you're gonna be pretty high on the transplant list. Something else will come up.
it's not the kidney I'm upset about.
your son.
we hadn'spoken in over a year.
it took me months to find him.
this was my chance to get him back. -Right.
I know P. J. can be selfish... rude...
but it hasn't been easy for him.
his mom died.
I worked late most nights.
I made a lot of mistakes.
you can't blame yourself.
some people are just broken.
I guess you just try not to care too much.
then you can't be disappointed.
these are, uh, your discharge papers.
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I'm...
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
it's okay.
now all you have to do is sign there at the bottom, and you're free to go.
you must think I'm a terrible person... refusing to give my kidney.
we're not thinking anything, ma'am.
he's taken everything.
my love, my pride, my dignity-- it's all gone.
but the one thing that he doesn't have is the kidney.
and the thought of giving him that last part of me...
you must think I'm a terrible person.
I'm not allowed to think anything.
there are rules that prevent me from having an opinion here
good rules, rules in place for a reason
because giving an organ that god put in your body to someone else isn't something that you can be coerced into doing.
it is... a big thing.
it is an extraordinary thing.
it's a gift that must be freely given.
and if you were to give it, and I'm not asking you to, but if you were to give it, it's not just for your husband.
it's for five other people, people that you don't know from Adam.
our six donors are all anesthetized and ready to go.
they'll be done first, followed by the recipients.
each pair will be color-coded so as not to confuse them.
this surgery is a hornet's nest, people, so work quickly but carefully.
use each other. Operate as a team.
let's go make medical history.
we're lucky as hell that woman changed her mind.
Yes, we are. Yes, we are.
now that's what I call a nice-looking kidney.
put that on ice and start flushing in the preservation solution.
you want to do the honors, dr. Yang?
good.
that's quite a geyser of urine, sir.
that means we did our job right. You never get tired of seeing that.
we're ready for you, Grey.
walking with the kidney.
5-second rule! 5-second rule!
uh, hold it still, boki.
I'm gonna need more ice, uh, and another tie.
I'll get it. -No, you don't touc anything else.
someone dropped a damn kidney?
I know you don't want to talk about it anymore. I know you're over it.
Oh, for the love of god. -Just hear me out.
I like to be good at things, okay?
I do not fail. I do not quit.
I like to be good at things, and I want to be good at this.
so... I need you.
I need you to show me.
show you?
just because you didn't publish a big clinical trial doesn't mean you're not a genius.
fine. Take off your pants.
Really?
Oh, my god. Thank you.
thank you so much.
I'll show you the Sloan method.
won't ever be in a medical journal, but it should.
shouldn't it be pinking up by now?
it's just getting venous blood.
let's check the back side again.
I don't know. I think I see... a little pink, maybe.
Ah, come on, come on.
all right.
come on.
come on, pink up.
come on.
pink up, pink up, pink up, pink up.
come on.
Yes. Yeah, it looks good.
we have a live kidney.
Oh, come on. I am offering two interns.
two interns for the price of one--come on.
I'll trade you laura for both of 'em.
Leo drains pus and likes it.
I dropped an internal organ... on the floor.
it happens. -Okay, okay.
uh, how about this?
four goes to George. I get James.
Karev, you get two. Izzie, give Leo.
what are you people doing?
we were just, uh, just deciding which of our interns to give to George.
Oh, you think I got to choose my interns, and I picked you people 'cause you're all such a surgical dream team?
you--you're lazy. You're whiny.
butterfingers overhere is downright depressing, and you, yang, you-- you're just annoying.
choosing their own interns... what are
what... give me those damn cards.
O'malley... you have interns.
what is it?
okay, open his fluids. Karev, push a gram of Mag.
do a C. B.C. And electrolytes.
Stevens, uh, order a color flow doppler and do a full neuro workup.
you think there's a bleed?
there's no way of knowing till we evaluate everything.
where is... P. J? Where's my son?
Stan had better be dead right now.
he's doing fine.
he hasn't called my room.
just lay back.
he hasn't asked for me.
it's been three years.
I gave a kidney for him, and he still hasn't made a choice.
he hasn't asked about you or called.
I think he's made a choice.
but I gave a kidney for him.
I gave a kidney.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Hey, man, the nurse was supposed to bring my dinner like an hour ago.
your dad just had a seizure.
okay.
so what does that mean?
it means something's wrong.
it means he could be dying, and he doesn't know you give a crap.
honestly, he doesn't know, and maybe you don't, but if you do, he's dying, and you're gonna be too late.
Alex, stop.
he's asking for you, and you're gonna be too late, and you're gonna live with it for the rest of your life!
you really want to live with that, huh?
do you? -Alex! Alex.
so tomorrow we'll meet, uh, one hour before pre-rounds.
dude, that's, like, 4:00 A. M.
Dr. Stevens never made us come in before pre-rounds.
Yeah, O'malley, you gotta chill.
they probably should say dr. O'malley.
so those are your interns?
did you even ask for me? -What?
I helped you study.
I helped decorate your stupid locker.
I-nd you didn't-- you don't-- you don't even see it.
you don't see anything.
I am such an idiot.
and you are a jerk.
you didn't even think to ask for me?
screw you, Dr. O'malley.
ms. Loring and Mr. Mercer, they're all stable.
but Mr. Walling, he has delayed graft function and god knows what else.
Ah, the press is gonna be all over this tomorrow.
and I'll need you available for interviews and some photo-ops.
make sure you wear your nice scrubs.
did you hear me, sir? Mr. Walling--he has a serious complication.
his electrolytes are off, his crit's down.
but you saved five other lives.
that's a pretty good scorecard. Not perfect, but good.
I told you. I don't want to see Stan.
I'm not taking you to see Stan.
Oh, this is her. This is the woman who gave me her kidney.
how's she doing?
I'm keeping a close eye on her, but so far, she's completely stable.
come with me.
this man is very ill, maybe dying.
he's got a perfect, healthy donor kidney that wasn't dropped on the floor.
there's only so much we can help... and so much we can hurt.
forgive yourself.
visiting hours are over.
it's okay.
your urine output is up to 25 cc's pr. Hou that should make you happy.
my wife would've been happy.
who's gonna care about my urine output now?
well, things are gonna be a little different.
Ah, Dr. Bailey. I heard your big surgery went well today.
Congratulations. -Same to you.
must feel good to see your name in print like that.
it would feel better if Meredith wasn't so
you know, she's acting silly about the credit. She's getting emotional.
that girl worked her ass off for you, and you got all the credit.
I would've gotten all the blame had we failed. -But you didn't fail.
it's simple. I'm an attending. She's a second-year resident.
who you're now living with. That's not simple. It's messy.
if it were me, I'd start with "thank you.
you'd be surprised how far that one goes, especially with us silly, emotional women.
so Derek said that I was a baby. -What?
and that I had a lot to learn.
whatever.
I mean, not whatever. He's right.
I did drop a kidney. And don't say it happens, because it doesn't.
but I do hate it when he's right.
no, okay, he is not right.
stop caring so much about what he thinks. It makes you seem desperate.
okay, to the one trolling for interns.
Yeah, I changed my mind.
interns are weak. I don't want weak.
you know, Burke was a man.
he was a man.
I think, uh, we need another round.
Hey, Joe. How you doing?
excuse me.
here you go.
Wh--ho-- is this for me? -Yes.
Hey, honey. I brought you roses. Let me back in the house.
Oh, no. -Yes.
holy crap. What the hell is that thing?
Oh, that is a kidney in a jar.
that's not fair. How did you get that?
well, being an incredibly important, fancy neurosurgeon has its perks.
thank you.
I couldn't have done it without you, not one surgery, not one patient.
I couldn't have done any of it without you. Thanks.
Yeah, could you guys go ahead and get this thing the hell out of here before people start to freak out?
okay. -okay.
um, are you gonna be okay? -Yeah, yeah, go ahead.
all right. Good night.
good night. -Good night, Joe.
the thing about choosing teams in real life, it's nothing like it used to be in gym class.
being first pick can be terrifying.
take off your pants.
excuse me? -Take off... your pants.
we're trying this again.
and being chosen last... isn't the worst thing in the world.
what?
I care about you.
I care about you, and I'm not gonna go crazy, and I'm not nna try to kill myself, and I'm not gonna stop caring about you, no matter how hard you push me away.
shut up and get out of my room. -No.
I care about you.
and I know you care about me, too. It is not too late for us.
get out of my room. -Admit it.
admit that you care about me, too. I know you do, and I care about you.
I care about you.
I care about you. I care about you.
I care about you.
I-- so we watch from the sidelines, clinging to our isolation...
it glows. -Yeah.
when my mother was a resident, she wasn't dropping kidneys.
you're reading your mom's diary? -Yeah.
I'm not half the surgeon my mother was.
because we know as soon as we let go of the bench...
what, are you leaving already?
there are no real men left in the world, Joe.
see you. -Yeah.
Hey, shot and a beer. Uh, Whiskey.
you know what? Better make it just the beer. I start work tomorrow.
someone comes along and changes the game completely.
if you're a normal person, one of the few things you can count on in life is death.
hello. -these are amazing.
they're-- they're all about the medicine.
I mean, there's, like, no personal crap, no talk about boyfriends or feelings.
she hardly even mentions you.
Yes, thank you for pointing that out.
what about when she held the retractor for six hours without moving?
but if you're a surgeon...
even that comfort is taken away from you.
they're like the Harry Potter books I never had.
Hey, did you read the part when she did the pyloric stenosis on the 3-week-old baby?
surgeons cheat death.
we prolong it, we deny it.
hold on. He's in v-fib.
charge to 300.
clear.
up to 360. Clear.
we stand and defiantly give death the finger.
he's good. Let's go.
Hey, you're late.
she has skills lab.
good morning, Cristina. It feels like minutes.
see you later?
no, no, Tucker. I did not say i won't do the marriage counseling.
I'm saying I can't do it in the mornings again.
I'm now 20 minutes late for work.
o-okay. I'll see you tonight.
marriage counseling-- how's that going?
you just heard us arguing about the marriage counseling. How do you think it's going?
no. You're doing a craniotomy on my patient Rosemary Bullard today.
now are you gonna be awake for that, or will you be yawning into her brain?
Meredith kept me up most of the night.
I don't want to hear about your dirty, nasty-- talking on the phone with Cristina.
and they stole your sleep?
did you say Yang goes or I go?
I don't think I'd win that one.
those two come as a set. You should know that by now.
before she had Burke. Burke helped. -True.
I think counseling's a good move.
Addison and I did counseling.
right before you got divorced!
ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce...
a state-of-the-art, computerized patient simulator.
Stan can educate you in airway management, trauma assessment and care.
he breathes, he pulsates, he seizes, he hemorrhages, he secretes and he speaks.
Hello, Stan.
Hello, doctor. I'm not feeling well.
Stan will tell you what he needs, and he's more forgiving than most patients.
you kill him, he'll keep coming back for more.
so make good use of him, people.
we're operating on robots now?
can we please go back to pigs? -Yeah, what about people?
uh, when the chief decides which one of you gets to do the first solo surgery, you'll want to be ready.
wait, did you just say solo surgery?
I do not know what it will be. I do not know when it will be.
I do know that the winner should be prepared to do any surgical procedure and will choose one intern to scrub in.
so practice your skills, impress your attendings and just do not make me look stupid.
uh, Grey, Stevens, you're with Hahn. Yang, the pit.
Karev and O'Malley, you're skills lab today, so you can take turns getting to know...
mine!
I am having chest pain.
so just to be clear, we are not cracking open any chests today?
no, Stevens.
it's just that with the solo surgery coming up, we were kinda hoping to be on a cool surgical something...
right, I'm gonna stop you right there.
listen, I don't get attached to patients, but I like this guy.
and I have spent almost two years giving his family hope and then taking it away.
this procedure can buy him time until he can get another shot at a transplant.
so we need to make sure it works, okay?
Absolutely. -Of course.
you've familiarized yourself with the case?
Yeah, Michael Norris-- 44-year-old male with congenital hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who has failed medical treatment at Seattle Pres.
he's been waiting on a heart transplant since narrowly missing out on one on May 14th of two thousand
wait, wait.
what? -May 14th what?
what?
that's... that's Denny's heart.
that's the heart I stole for Denny.
I need you to have sex with Cristina Yang.
good morning.
distract her. Engage her.
give her something to do after midnight besides call my girlfriend and wake me up.
Yang? No.
no, too serious, humorless, un-fun-- not my type.
yang should be your type.
she's intense, intelligent, complicated.
she's like a single malt scotch, and you're used to beer bongs.
Callie Torres is no beer bong.
Oh, you know, wait a minute. I get it.
you don't think you have a shot.
you're probably right.
Oh, I have a shot.
then try it, as a favor. -No. I'm not your stud horse.
you can't just-- just tell me who to sleep-- you slept with my wife.
Yeah, I'll give it a shot.
okay, good.
are you guys shooting drugs? Oh, my god.
no. We're practicing I.V.S.
how else are we supposed to learn?
yang never lets us do anything.
so you're practicing on each other.
we did it at Baylor. It's cool.
no, it's not cool. It's crazy.
it's, like, creepy-basement crazy.
d-don't tell anyone.
don't worry. She won't tell.
Ah, Dr. Hunt. Got a second?
it's about to get a little loud in here, sir, but shoot.
uh, listen, we're getting ready to award the first solo surgery to a second-year resident.
I want your take.
uh-- unidentified male, mid-30s, lost vitals in the field, shocked him back into sinus tach.
possible fractures in both arms, unstable pelvis.
okay, on three. Two, three.
good, go.
open right tib/fib, rigid abdomen.
what doesn't this guy have? -Found him under a freeway overpass.
cops think someone threw him over.
after they beat him half to death?
so it's a contest, the solo surgery?
you have fresh eyes. You don't know them personally.
you don't have any history, any relationship.
that perspective is rare here.
I'll give it some thought.
Oh, Dr. Webber, I was just wondering, uh, regarding the solo surgery,
I presume it's gonna be a, um, general surgery?
I just wanted to be prepared.
you'll know when you all know.
and one more thing, if my E. R. reports are right, you've been working for three days straight.
when do you sleep?
you keep tabs on all your attendings, or just the new guys?
his I. V. blew. -Yang, he needs that access now.
Yes, I'm doing it, sir.
this will buy him some time until you get that line in.
if you were less worried about winning contests, you might have thought of it.
so you're... gonna give me a-a heart attack, literally?
uh, it's a technique called alcohol ablation, uh, through a catheter in your femoral artery.
Dr. Hahn will inject ethanol straight into your heart.
the alcohol will incinerate any tissue cells it touches.
Dr. Stevens?
w-we're gonna be burning away the muscle in your ventricle that's, um, blocking your ability to get oxygen.
if we're successful, you should feel immediate relief, so...
just like that, I'll... be able to breathe?
just like that.
and-- and he can't be asleep during the procedure? -I'm afraid not.
Dr. Stevens here will be asking you to cough, inhale and exhale.
and checking to see if I'm dead yet?
Mike, stop.
I mean, it...
it is a heart attack, right?
it's a dangerous procedure, but it's one that we can monitor and control.
and if you don't have it, the next heart attack you have.
and you will have one-- will kill me.
promise you'll keep me awake?
I don't want to miss this.
I want Mike's latest echo and angio before he goes to the cath lab.
are you freaking out? -What?
Why? Do you think I should be?
this patient... in Denny's old room? It's a lot of Denny for one day, Iz.
it is a lot.
a lot.
is it a lot of Denny for you, too?
I mean, how much Denny are you experiencing?
iz, you can do this.
my pain is getting worse.
my pain is getting worse. -I hate this.
I'm not gonna win the solo surgery practicing on plastic man.
you're not gonna win the solo surgery because you suck.
your bedside manner is what sucks.
what? What did you say?
ain't technology amazing? -Screw is.
I'm gonna practice medicine. You go ahead and play with your doll.
what's the matter, scared of a little education?
you are so awesome, you are so-- no!
No! Stan!
what does a guy have to do to get a beating this bad?
maybe he'll tell us when he wakes up.
well, let's hope he makes it that long.
uh, three, run these to the lab, and then go by the morgue and get the forms for an unclaimed body.
he's gonna need a chest tube, right?
cause I was just hoping--with the solo surgery coming up
with the solo surgery coming up, your job is to impress me. So go.
Dr. Yang, with the solo surgery coming up, your job is to impress me.
you are planning for this man's death while I am fighting for his life.
I was trying to be prepared. I'm sorry.
I can't use sorry. I could use a doctor.
be one.
the kinds of metastases you have are prone to spontaneous bleeding.
so there are considerable risks to the surgery.
are you saying this one might be dicier? -Might be a little dicier?
much dicier than previous surgeries.
I want to be clear. You can live with this tumor for months if not longer.
not-- not like this.
not feeling this bad.
I understand that risks are part of the package.
that's why you people make me go cross-eyed signing all these for Ms.
you're signing a "do not resuscitate" order?
if it's my time to go.
she doesn't want to be on a life support kind of thing.
she'd hate that. -I'd just hate lying around like that.
I don't want that. -Okay.
good-bye, darling. -Good-bye, love.
Oh, sorry.
we... we do this every time.
she signs the paper, we kiss good-bye, and then after the surgery, we say hello again.
well, that sounds like a plan to me.
you rest up. We'll be bringing you up soon.
okay.
that there is the holy grail of marriage.
something to aspire to.
what happens to them?
you sign, the attending signs, pink copy goes in his chart.
no, I-I-I mean the bodies, the-- the unclaimed bodies. What happens to them?
well, if they remain unclaimed for a certain amount of time, they're cremated--the ones that haven't been preserved.
preserved?
for medical research-- gross anatomy, surgical study-- that sort of thing.
for, like, med students? -Exactly. For med stu-students.
to practice on?
you're pretty.
thank you all for being here.
I appreciate the opportunity to learn, and I'm sorry you had to die.
Oh, uh, uh, instrument trays.
hold compressions. We got a rhythm.
we've got to get him up to surgery. He's bleeding through his leg splint.
so the chief asked me to watch the second years for the solo surgery.
what's your take, as a class?
they're a mixed bag. Yang's very good.
she's, uh, hard-core. She'll be a cardio god.
she's my roommate, actually. -And Stevens?
she's smart, good with patients, very compassionate... supposedly.
she did sleep with my ex-husband while we were still married.
you know what? I'm more interested in the doctor part.
right. Yeah. Obviously. Of course.
new scans. Good.
there's a splenic subcapsular hematoma.
I can look. Go update his chart.
Dr. Yang, you paged me?
uh, yeah, patient, trauma one.
Aw, you paged me for a consult? I was hoping you wanted to see me.
I did. Uh, uh, the patient has a shattered nose and cheekbones and a fractured left mandible.
trauma one.
okay, Mike, the catheters are in. It's time to inject.
okay, just hold tight. Stevens, over here, please.
I specifically chose you for this case because you connect well with patients.
Yeah, that's actually something I've been told to work on not doing.
Mike needs you talking to him.
he's scared, his pulse is elevating. Step up.
okay. Oh, yeah.
Hey, Mike.
U're doing great.
you're gonna feel a little bit of burning.
well, then we get--oh!
Oh, there it is. Oh, god.
try not to move.
um, try-- try to lay still, Mike, and try to breathe.
make it stop. Make it stop.
Mike, we can't stop, but it's gonna end soon, so just hang in there.
Stevens, talk to him. -I'm-- I'm sorry.
okay, Grey, how is his pressure? -85 systolic.
open up his I. V -Stens, talk to him! Help him!
Stevens, get him to cough, get him to breathe.
Stevens! -pressure's stabilizing.
okay, how are you doing, Mike?
I still... can't breathe.
does that mean we're not successful?
Mike, there were two arterial routes I could choose.
the next time we do this, I think...
no, I can't. I won't do this again.
please, I can't-- I can't do this again.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
tell Stevens to find me so I can permanently throw her off my service.
Dr. Hahn, I know you have a history with this patient, but in a weird way, Izzie does, too.
a history, with my patient?
no, with Denny Duquette.
tell her to find me.
the tumor's position has been altered.
I need an ultrasound localization.
took care of my Yang problem, by the way.
already?
that sounds too easy.
if it doesn't feel like work, it's not going to work.
Where'd you learn that, hmm, marriage counseling?
of course not. It's a complete waste of time.
this couple, the Bullards, I bet they never got counseling.
they just take their bad with the good.
damn it. The tumor's hemorrhaging.
her brain's starting to swell.
push 70 of the mannitol.
she's bradying down. Uh, 1 of atropine.
let's make sure these two get a chance to say hello again.
have you seen Izzie? -No
you got anything I can scrub in on? Robot patient sucks.
listen, Izzie is having a rough day, so if you see her, -don't-- no, no, no, I'm having a rough day.
what happened?
hunt. Hunt hates me. I mean, he hates me.
he kissed you.
uh, that was, I don't know, before. Now he hates my guts.
this is worse than Hahn.
I mean, I-I have no idea what I did or-- or said or what...
I gotta get off this case.
Dr. Yang...
our guy is scheduled for surgery, and I want to know when I'm gonna see you next.
uh, he's not stable yet.
well, then we might have time to-- uh, I just got paged down.
this does not happen to me.
bow to me, for I am the queen of the interns.
I have assembled an army of the dead to teach us things.
Cadavers-- I got us cadavers to practice on, a whole bunch of 'em.
you got cadavers, human cadavers?
they're down in the tunnels. We'll meet there for lunch.
let me ask you something.
do you know if Izzie Stevens had some sort of a relationship with Denny Duquette?
what, you mean besides the engagement, oh, and the cutting of his l-vad wire so she could move him up the transplant list?
what, you didn't know about this?
Izzie was on probationary leave.
she was, like, nearly kicked out of the program.
I forget you weren't here then. -No, I wasn't.
I was at another hospital watching my patient's heart get stolen out of his chest.
did you page me down here for sex? 'Cause I'm not really in the mood.
want to see some dead guys?
Why? -Come on.
why would you say that? Why?
cadavers... for practice...
what? -For the solo surgery.
what is this?
I heard you were having a crappy day. I thought this would cheer you up.
what?
it's like a bouquet of corpses. That is so, um, I'm sorry.
no. That's crazy. He's dead. He is dead.
just so many dead people today.
these are for interns.
go play with the dummy!
Ah, come on!
I cannot help it. I'm dying.
but I'm applying pressure.
there must be something you're forgetting.
Oh, for crying out loud!
I'm surprised you even passed your intern exam.
Oh, my god.
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.
chief, I have to talk to you.
Hey, Hahn. Come in. I want you to watch this.
let's blow an artery.
I'm bleeding out.
it's about Izzie Stevens and Denny Duquette.
how is Stevens still working here?
how is Seattle Grace still accredited? This whole thing goes unreported?
it's no wonder this place is number 12. What kind of hospital are you running?
you want to stop right there, Erica.
I want an ethics review panel assembled.
I want Stevens' role in this investigated, and Bailey's as well, because she was her superior.
slow down, Erica. -No.
my patient lost a heart over this, Richard!
someone is damn well gonna lose their job. -Stop!
we're not digging this up.
it didn't go unreported. It was reported to me. I dealt with it.
Stevens was punished. She's learned from her mistake.
and she is on her way to becoming an excellent surgeon.
that's the kind of hospital I'm running.
now this issue has been laid to rest.
it's in the past, and that's where it's gonna stay.
it is not in the past for me.
it's lying on a bed in the I. C. U. about to die.
then your only responsibility is to make sure that doesn't happen.
it was a difficult surgery, especially at her age.
we're not sure how she's gonna respond.
Oh, sure.
the waiting is always the hard part.
ed, she might not make it through the night.
I know. I know.
you hiding from Hahn?
sure. Her, too.
is Mike okay?
no, the ablation failed. And he's refusing to try again, so Hahn's...
um, you should go talk to her.
I stole his heart, Meredith.
I stole it for Denny. I stole it for myself.
and now I'm supposed to hold his hand while we torture him?
I can't even look at him.
it's my fault that he's here.
so anyway... I'm hiding.
yang, suction here, please.
Sloan's coming in for the mandibular repair?
sorry about before.
Everybody's, uh, up in everybody else's business around here, you know?
better to keep things professional if you can.
Yes.
cause one minute you're working with people, and then you're friends with them and then you're whatever, and then suddenly there's all this pressure to define what you are, like it's all black-and-white. You're either this or you're that.
you are aware that you're doing it again, right?
Dr. Hunt, how's our mystery man?
still with us. He's a fighter.
hate to be the other guy.
Dr. Yang, I know cracking chests is more your thing, but you'd be surprised how exciting it can be when I manipulate a little skin.
actually, Dr. Yang, why don't you just scrub out? We've got enough hands in here.
okay.
Oh, hey. I heard he went up. Can I scrub in?
Oh, shut it. If I'm not in, you're not in.
God, you stink.
I showered. - You smell like formaldehyde.
why do you smell like death?
why do you smell like death?
I see dead people. - get out.
I need off my Hunt case, so in a one-time-only offer,
I'm gonna trade you my beaten-to-a-pulp traumapalooza patient for no less than, uh, three of your cadavers.
pony up.
deal, take three.
I need to be with people,
preferably live people-- but whatever.
Alex, by the way, thank you for bringing me the corpses.
it was very sweet.
Dr. Hunt and Dr. Sloan are still operating.
do you think I could try- no.
Hey, so check this out, my dead mommy taught me a cool way to hold these instruments.
if you calm it, you can switch off faster.
when your dead mommy teaches you things, can you see her?
no.
I'm reading her journals.
Duh. I was kidding...
I did see her once, though, and that bomb squad guy...
and Denny.
today?
no.
I was dead at the time.
I still feel my mom with me sometimes.
I gotta get off this case.
could I- no.
please don't be in there.
Dr. Hahn, I came to apologize and ask if I could please be let off your service.
no.
if I can convince Mike to have another ablation, you're gonna be there to see him through, to look him in the eye, to help him through the pain that you have caused him.
and if he dies, I want you there for that, too, because you're responsible.
he decided.
he won't do another procedure.
I'm going to...
go check him out.
Dr. Stevens...
she'll be okay.
this has...
this has been coming for a long time.
she'll be okay. She'll...
she'll move on.
if you die...
she will not get over it.
she will not move on.
she'll think she can, she'll even think she has, and then...
out of the blue, you'll be right there with her, so close she'll think she can touch you, and then all of this will just...
be happening for her all over again.
and she will not be able to move on.
they're-- they're not doing anything.
make them do something. They're just standing around.
Mr. Bullard, they're keeping her comfortable.
that's all they can do.
you and Rosie agreed there would be no extreme measures taken if her time came.
well, her time is here. - What's go on?
uh, she's coding, and Mr. Bullard is reconsidering the D. N. R. order.
ed, this is what I warned you about, this moment.
even if we try to resuscitate her, I'm not sure she's gonna wake up again.
nothing more we can do.
no.
no. Stay with me, Rosie.
stay with me.
don't leave me, Rosie.
stay with me, Rosie.
don't leave me. Stay with me.
stay with me, Rosie.
stay with me. Come back, Rosie.
don't leave me. Stay with me.
don't leave me. Stay with me, Rosie. Stay with me.
stay with me. Don't leave me, Rosie.
no...
Mr. Bullard...
do something for her then. Do something. - I'm so sorry. Mr. Bullard.
No! - No!
now-- just- let he be.
please, Rosie. Please.
I'm glad you decided to try again.
you can thank Dr. Stevens.
it's her fault we're here, right?
vitals are stable. He's ready for the injection.
all right. Alcohol is going in.
Oh, wait. Wait, don't.
Mike, look at me.
just stay with me.
it's going to hurt, but not as much as you think it's going to.
okay, he's in S. V. T.
there may be alcohol backing into his A. V. node.
get him to cough. Get him to breathe.
Mike, you need to breathe.
cough for me.
look at me, Mike. Look at me.
he's in v-tach, losing consciousness.
all right, push 100 of lidocaine. Get the pacer ready.
Oh, no. It's Lexie.
I gotta go.
beaten-to-a-pulp guy is coding.
Oh, no.
pulp guy is mine.
we traded.
why didn't you put in a chest tube?
well, I was-- I don't know how.
what do you mean, you don't know how?
I mean, I learned that in my first week.
Yes, you learned, you know.
but I will never know because you not only won't let me try one, but you-- you hog all our robots and you steal our corpses.
dude, I think you broke her.
vitals are stable for now.
was there this much blood in his urine before?- No.
well, he's gonna need a bedside cystogram.
dibs on that. - No, no, no, it's mine, and his bladder repair is mine, too.
no, we traded for him. I get his bladder. - No, no, you see.
no, we never traded, and just to prove your wrong, three, next time this guy crashes, you put in his chest tube.
get away from that man right now.
uh, he was crashing, so we upped his dopamine and gave- are you deaf, karev?
I said get away from him.
I'm just saying that we were saving his life.
no, what you did was pick over him like vultures, like a bunch of children fighting over toys.
what you did was treat a man that's fighting to live as if he's already dead.
you have no sense, no decency and no respect!
just get out. Just get out of here.
ROSEMARY'S gone.
her heart is no longer beating on its own.
the second you stop doing what you're doing, it will stop.
I-I can't be the one...
to let her go...
to let her die.
I...
I know.
I know you can't.
here you go. Sit down.
sit down.
Dr. Bailey.
all right, let's get the crash cart in here.
open your eyes.
just stay here with me.
I need you to fight, Mike.
fight to stay with Elyse.
you have to live through this.
you need to breathe right now.
right now!
you don't have to do it.
let me.
let me.
I'll need you to, uh, bring me the post-op report on our beating victim before you leave tonight.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Did you say something?
yang, what is wrong with you?
sir?
I've had women opt for needless elective buttock enhancement surgery just for another chance to be flirted with by me.
so what's your deal?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I've been hitting on you all day.
I...Really?
excuse me.
it was a stupid idea.
it wasn't even my idea. It was shepherd's idea.
Oh, come on.
that woman is not a single malt scotch, my friend.
she is bad, cheap wine that gives you a headache you can feel in your teeth.
Oh, Dr. Hunt.
any thoughts on the second years after today?
it's only been a day, sir.
well, of course.
they're undisciplined, inarticulate, and they have a lot to learn about respect.
mostly, they're more interested in their personal crap than in anything else, and I'm not sure that they're being taught anything different.
honestly, I'm not sure I'll be staying on.
excuse me, sir.
tell me I am not seeing what I'm seeing.
tell me I am not seeing a roomful of human bodies' half-open, scattered and forgotten about.
they're unclaimed bodies.
unclaimed?
each of one of these people was loved.
each one of these people was somebody's somebody, so we are responsible for treating them as such.
we claim them and treat them with respect!
close them up, cover them up, and put them back where they belong.
now!
the wife's here, of the beating victim.
she I. D. her husband, so she wanted to- what's his name?
I wondered if you asked her husband's name so that he could become a person to you.
they're all people, Yang.
this is not a game or a contest or a competition to see who gets a surgery and who don't.
they're people, and we get to save them.
now you're good. You're excellent.
you could win all the contests, but if that's why you're doing this, then you shouldn't be.
so did you find out his name?
my dad died when I was 9, in a car accident.
I was with him in the car.
while we waited for the ambulance, I tried to keep his chest closed so he wouldn't bleed so much.
when he died...
my hands...
felt his heart stop beating.
that's why I do this.
it's also why I win all the contests.
the patient's name is Tom.
single malt scotch.
we're born, we live, we die.
sometimes not necessarily in that order.
clear!
Yes!
you don't get to die!
nice job.
Oh, hi.
um... thanks. I, uh...
you know, he's just a robot.
uh, I want to take back what I said before about leaving.
I was overreacting. I was just...
it was personal, and I wondered if you could just forget about it.
get some sleep, Dr. Hunt.
see you tomorrow.
chief?
good save, O' Malley.
thank you.
we put things to rest...
only to have them rise up again.
I'm in.
so I ended my day with a segmental colectomy.
Oh, badass.
Seriously?
what? Oh, did you think we'd double-date?
look, I'm gonna take my pants off, so unless you want to stay and see- nope.
I'll see it later.
I'm gonna go downstairs.
so if death is not the end, what can you count on anymore?
so how's your patient doing?
well, he still needs a heart, but I bought him some time.
good, I'm glad.
I went to the chief about Izzie Stevens, and he completely shut me down.
well, we'll see what he says when I report this to U. N.O. S.
wait, why?
what...what good would come of that?
what do you mean?
what possible good would it do?
I mean, would it benefit your patient's outcome or...
my patient wouldn't be here if it wasn't for her.
so you're gonna report this to U. N.O. S. and cost this hospital its transplant certification, cost our patients organs, cost people their jobs, cost Izzie Stevens her career?
wait, so you're taking Izzie Stevens' side in this over mine?
she's a doctor, one of our doctors.
there's a reason we have each other's backs, Erica.
Oh, please do not talk to me about a code, because this is not that.
no, this is that.
look, I don't know what happened between Denny Duquette and Izzie Stevens that night, but unless you were in the middle of that situation,
I don't see how you can make a judgment.
easy. There's right and there's wrong.
and this was wrong and illegal.
there is no gray area here you can't kind of think this is okay.
you can't kind of side with Izzie Stevens.
and you can't kind of be a lesbian.
Yes, I can.
because you sure can't count on anything in life.
I can't believe I didn't know this.
Erica, the chief is right. - No, you.
I don't know you at all.
life is the most fragile, unstable, unpredictable thing there is.
no.
no.
you can't be here.
I have to move on. I...
I love you, and I will always love you, but I have to move on.
that's why I had that patient today and that's...
why I helped save his life, so that I wouldn't feel guilty anymore and I can move on.
so please...
you have to go.
go where?
are you okay?
Yes.
Yes.
I am totally okay.
I'm fine. Everything's fine.
I have to change, but I'll meet you at the bar, okay? - All right.
okay.
in fact, there's only one thing about life we can be sure of...
are you sure you're okay?
it ain't over till it's over.
it's intense, what happens in the O. R.
when lives are on the line...
and you're poking at brains like they're silly putty.
you form a bond with the surgeons right next to you...
an unbreakable, indescribable bond.
it's intimate, being tied together like that...
you up?
no. -Yes.
whether you like it or not, whether you like them or not, you become family.
the wicked witch is dead.
metaphorically dead or dead dead?
who are we talking about?
her name is off the surgical board. Her surgeries have been canceled.
I don't know how or why, but I do know Hahn is gone.
that's too bad. She was really talented.
U're not talking to me.
is, uh, Grey home?
Yes. -Death?
come on. Where are you, death?
death?!
die! Oh, my god! -It's been-- forever.
you look like...
death! Death!
is the guy in the pajamas your boyfriend?
cause if so, then hot. -Right?
who are you? -I'm Sadie. Who are you?
I'm--I'm--I'm Cristina.
apparently they went backpacking around europe together or something... Before med school.
you know that woman all but kicked me out of the bed?
that's terrible. -And death?
Meredith's name is not death. It's Mer.
I really feel for you.
you know, she's never even mentioned this woman.
I mean, how good of a friend can she be?
good enough to kick us both out of bed.
welcome to my world.
this woman is the reason I went to med school in the first place.
I figured if a slacker like death... -Mer.
could handle slicing people open, then I could, too.
Meredith's not a slacker.
Ooh, I could tell you some stories. -But you won'T.
so, Sadie, you postponed your residency to work in a mor yeah, you know, a lot of the fun cutting, none of the rules, but I got bored.
started craving blood that was flowing.
and now you're here. I can't believe you're here.
iz, you coming? -Yeah. I just need a minute.
look, I get it.
Hahn's case brought up the Denny thing. But Hahn's not even here anymore.
it's stuff from the past.
stuff from the past, Iz.
you don't understand. -I might...
if you'd talk to me.
fine.
see you inside.
I'm walking. -Morning.
walking straight ahead, all by myself.
you know, you look good. Tired, but good.
did I mention I find the short hair kind of sassy?
now I'm turning this corner, again, all alone.
these are s--uh, scratches from my kitten. He's a crazy scratchy scratcher.
you're a cat person? -I meant hairbrush.
It--it--I have a crazy scratchy hairbrush.
solo surgeries are at stake here, three.
I can't have you acting weird or wounded.
I'm--I am on top of my game. Really.
I'm sending you to plastics, far, far away. Just go.
Hey, what do you know about a heart guy named dixon?
Dixon? Uh, no, not a guy. I've heard of virginia dixon.
she's got an incredible record. Really low mortal
wait. Is she coming here? -Yeah. Today.
piggyback heart transplant. I'm on the case.
what? What? W-why am I not on the case?
so she's your pre-cristina cristina?
you gonna tell me why she calls you death?
Oh, no. The adventures of dea and die are better left untold.
Hey, pedia's julienning her skinny little chickearms, and still no word on what made "h" hitch a ride with her flying monkeys.
later. -Translate that for me.
Lexie may be a secret cutter, and there's still no word on why Hahn quit.
is that true, about Lexie?
I don't know. How would I know?
if it's true, what are you gonna do about it? -Nothing.
Meredith, you can't do nothing. She's your sister.
And? -And you're family.
I'm not understanding. -Lexie is your family.
forget it.
Hello, Dr. Hunt. -Dr. Yang.
thank you.
Hey, what do we got? -Uh, crusinjuries.
couple minutes out.
Hey, w-what do you know about Hahn? -Um, she's gone.
Yeah, but why? -I don't know.
you two are friends.
I don't want to talk about it, okay? I want blood and guts and mangled bones.
I want a guy so badly smashed up, it takes all day to fix him.
I want to rock a surgery. I don't want to talk about hahn.
unidentified man with prolonged extrication time.
they had to fish him out of a working garbage truck.
multiple crush injuries, open fractures, G.C. S. 3, and we couldn't unhook him in the field.
unhook him?
his femur's broken in half, and it's puncturing his torso. He's impaled.
impaled on himself?
human pretzel.
that l do.
check his popliteal pulse.
I'm getting nothing. -That's because his knee is over here.
you think he was sleeping in that dumpster and they started crushing the trash?
that's a bad day.
Hey, I'm here. What did I miss?
okay, it's your first day. Why don't you just stand back and shut up?
breath sounds are clear and equal, both sides. Unbelievable.
so no punctured lung. We need a portable x-ray and an ultrasound.
someone paged us. -I did.
you did? That's a first. -So is this.
I've seen a lot of trauma-- guys cut in half, amputations, eviscerations
but I have never seen anything like this.
I wondered if you could help.
you hire when you're number 1, not number 12.
but I need you to be my ambassador today.
show DR. Dixon what seattle grace is all about.
I've thrown a lot of money, a big title and a lot of research dollars at her.
but... -but what?
she's a little different. She's a little off.
so we're wooing today, Bailey. -I can woo with the best of 'em.
so, what, Dixon is a nut job? -Excuse me?
I'm just saying, I've already had my quota of crazy for the year.
Hey, I've had my off days. You want to judge me?
you never even met the woman, Karev. Now you heard the chief.
our job is to impress DR. Dixon today, so be impressive.
I've got the chart for DR. Dixon. I'm ready to work.
I'm excited. -Don't be. She's off.
you okay? -Yeah.
all right. Heads-up. Here she comes.
Oh, Dr. Dixon.
welcome to, uh, Seattle Grace. We're very happy to h-have you here.
I'm--I'm Dr. Bailey. -I-I brought my own lab coat.
I'm here to perform a heart transplant today. I do hearts.
a procedure invented by Christiaan barnard in 1967. I do hearts.
uh, I--I'm Dr. Richard Webber. We spoke on the phone.
Karev, would you get Dr. Dixon the latest labs?
Stevens, let's prep the patient, please.
okay, then. She's a little off.
his femur's in pieces, I mean, except for the part that's stuck in his torso.
there's no way I'm saving that leg.
it looks like the impaled piece is lodged under his clavle.
c-spine looks clear. Without a C. T.It's hard to be sure.
and why can't we get a C. T. Scan?
the way he's impaled, it's hard to get a clear reading.
you know, there is such a thing as a stupid question.
stand over there. -Guys, guys, we have a very limited window here, okay?
with vitals like these, in a few more hours-- his body won't be able to withstansurgery at all.
good thing he's unconscious.
well, we can't do anything till we dislodge the femur from his clavicle.
okay, then let's unimpale him.
yang, Grey, new kid, hold his shoulders. Brace him hard.
I'll hold his c-spine. -I got his torso.
I need to guide the posterior hip dislocation.
the second that leg is out, be ready to assert pressure to stop the bleeding. Got it?
better thaworking on corpses, huh?
on the count of three.
one...
two...
three.
femur's really wedged in there. -Okay, push directly on the clavicle while I pull.
okay, almost there. Almost there. Steady.
just a little bit further. S-Sloan, I need you to, um, rotate his knee to my right.
push 10 of morphine now!
just get in there and hold the pressure.
okay, get his femur stabilized and down by his side.
corpses don't do that.
I need you to calm down, sir.
what are you doing to me? -Name?
get out of my face! Get your hands off! You're hurting me!
do as he says. Hands off, everybody.
but-- hands off.
thank you.
what's your name? -Timothy Miller.
Mr. Miller, w-we need to get you into surgery.
I'm gonna be able to walk, right? I gotta be able to walk.
right now, we're just trying to keep you alive.
our cardiac wing is extensive and well-equipped with all of - the first successful hearttransplant was performed on september 7, 1896, by Dr. Ludwig Rehn, Frankfurt, Germany.
okay.
uh, excuse me. I don't mean to interrupt.
uh-- please inter-- I mean, just, uh, please update DR. Dixon on theatient.
uh, Dr. Stevens is prepping your transplant patient for surgery.
they scheduled a-a-a transplant six years ago, but the heart was too small, so they doubled up and added a donor heart to help his own heart function.
they did a piggyback-- Heterotopic Transplant.
piggyback is the colloquial name for the procedure.
don't do that. don't do that.
how about we... take you to meet the patient?
they tell my heart belonged to a girl that was hit by a car while she was hitchhiking.
and now when I'm driving, I see hitchhikers all the time, always up ahead, just up ahead, but when I get up ahead, they're gone.
you're not buying any of this, are you? -I should never have gotten the heart.
I-I don't understand how the heart-- navajos--we don't even touch the dead.
we don't touch their bodies or belongings because the spirit clings there.
so to have part of a dead body sewed into my chest is...
my friends who follow the old ways, they begged me not to do it.
I should've listened. -I'm sorry. I don't understand.
you think you're haunted by your transplanted heart, but you're here for a new transplant.
No! That's what I'm trying to tell you. I don't want it.
I don't want the new one. I just want you to take the old one out.
wait. That's just plain stupid. Take the heart, man.
take the heart if they offer it.
did he just say he doesn't want the donor heart? -Yes, ma'am.
clay Bedonie, are you aware that without a new heart, you'll live a short life attached to a machine before dying a sudden and agonizing death?
see, that--that's what I'm talking about.
five parallel pulley stitches per cut, then switch.
you sure I'm numb? -Toughen up.
when one of our residents gets picked for the solo surgery, one of us gets to scrub in, so we have a goal here. Focus on the goal.
solo surgeries. Totally worth it.
solo... surgeries. Totally worth it.
Hello, I need someone to run these labs and pull these x-rays, please.
will do.
Hey, this looks like a cool place to hang out. What are you guys doing?
this is for internS. It's--it's our hangout. Go find your own.
sorry.
solo surgeries. Totally worth it.
I don't want to live if I can't walk.
we'll do our best to save the leg-- I'm homeless.
walking is how I survive. It's how I...get from one day to the next.
Marion street's safe from 2: 00 to 6: 00 A. M.
and then I go over the Half-Mast bridge, and I hang there till 6: 30 until the traffic hits.
and then I go over to belltown and hang out on the Waterfront.
and then the waterfront, if it's trouble, then I go back up to 4th street.
I'm homeless. I-I can't not walk.
I-I--what am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?
your injuries are critical. If we n't get you to surgery
will your surgery make me walk?
then I don't want it!
okay. All right.
you heard the man. The surgery's off.
I appreciate you trying to advise me to do what you think is best.
these are facts, not opinions.-What'm saying is
he's trying to say he would rather live a shorter life that's unhaunted than a longer one that is.
I'm not saying I agree. I'm just...
I'm just gonna stand over here.
that's a good idea.
the heart that you take out of me, what happens to it?
it goes from the O. R. To phology to medical waste.
I need that heart back for ritual.
we have laws. There are rules. Rules are rules.
maybe there's compromise to be made here.
uh, we could, I don't know, uh, give him back the old heart to do the ritual, then give him a chance to live by still putting the new heart in.
no. no.
it doesn't work that way.
I will still be haunted, just by a new ghost.
there are rules. We have laws, and there are-- rules are rules and laws are laws.
no.
so that's it? No surgery? You're just gonna walk away?
I'm respecting the patient's wishes.
the patient's unstable with an open wound. Which we are packing.
this guy is circling the drain. -You cannot just walk away.
don't tell me how to run things in my E. R. -Your E. R?
we save lives here. We don't just patch up patients and leave them to die.
if you can't handle that, go back the desert and leave us here to do our jobs.
Dr. Torres, please tell me you can figure out some way to build this man some legs.
well, the right femur's toast.
so is the hip and half the pelvis, but if I put some pins here and maybe a plate here...
I mean, there are some viable bone fragments. We're not starting from nothing.
what do you think? -I think it's wild.
all right, she wasn't talking to you.
it's her first day. Could you not be so
no, she's an intern. She needs to learn her place.
I think it's a lot of hardware. What the guy needs is a whole new leg.
well, maybe I can do that. Yeah, I mean, it's kind of a puzzle.
I just need to figure out what equipment I need and--and how to pull it off.
like Lincoln Logs. -Uh, it's a little more high-tech than that.
it's exactly like Lincoln Logs.
okay, I need you guys to grab every piece of titanium we've got in the hospital.
um, I need the hospil rules to specify the fact that we must respect all religious and spiritual beliefs of our patients.
the rules? -Yeah, I'm asking you to declare a rule of our department.
that we respect the beliefs of our patients? -Yes.
isn't that just common courtesy? -Yes.
then why am I declaring it?
Dr. Dixon doesn't do common courtesy, but she understands rules.
so if it's a rule, we're golden.
if not, we have a pissed-off patient an apoplectic surgeon, and none of those things makes for a successful procedure on a faulty heart, not to mention the failure to woo.
you want me to announce it as a rule.
I'm here's a witness, you can maybe raise your right hand, put your left one on the "physicians' desk reference.
it's a rule. -Thank you.
Dr. Dixon, I'm cristina yang.
I'm a resident here, and I've been focused on cardio since I began my internship.
I'm certainly looking forward to anything that you might
were the other ones taken off my case?
Oh, uh, what other ones?
the black one, the male one, the one with ylow hair.
not that I'm aware of. -Then why are you talking to me?
so-- what happened to Hahn?
wh-whatever made hahn leave, it can be fixed.
U-unless she a was fired. She wasn't fired, was she?
she's not coming back. -You don't know that.
she kinda does. -How?
because she doesn't...
look, it's just too...
we had a fight.
Oh, please. Meredith and I fight all the time. We still work together.
it's not like Hahn was your girlfriend or something.
Oh, my god. She was your girlfriend?
look, we hadn't... figured it all out.
wait, so are you a lesbian now? -I don't know.
maybe you were a once-bian.
or a twice-bian. Whatever. It's over.
are you okay? -She's fine. Leave her alone.
I hit the titanium mother lode.
Oh, come on. Really?
Hey, Lexie. How are you?
is, uh, everything going okay?
why, did somebody say something, like I was doing something?
no, I'm just, uh, you know, as, uh, I'm asking as a person who's sort of related to you if there's anything bothering you
so this is completely not as a boss or a resident or a superior keeping an eye on what I do as a student in this program?
no, no, I'm just a compassionate person, and I'm just wondering if you're channeling your tragic pain into, uh, self-mutilation.
are you a secret cutter? -No.
little grey, torres is, uh, trying to set a world record for most titanium rods used in one patient.
you in?
little Grey?
little Grey. Big Grey.
that's how I tell you two apart. -Yeah, I'm in. I'll just be a minute.
can't you people let a guy die in peace?
your, uh, vitals are slipping. I'm not gonna lie to you. That's not good.
I been through worse.
Yeah, I imagine you have.
Oh, don't get like that.
don't look at me like I'm some tragic hero with a secret past.
you have a story.
we all have a story.
I took a turn in my life. And I couldn't connect.
I lost...
I couldn't connect.
my life, it took a turn and...
and I just couldn't turn it back.
guys, we need to shut down for a few days.
people are starting to get suspicious.
I was accused of being a secret cutter.
so wear long sleeves.
Oh, I didn't realize we were inviting more people here.
are you kidding?
a secret intern society?
I'm all over that.
we, I still think we need to take fewer risks.
fewer risks? Come on. You got a guard at the door.
you're using more local anesthetic for three sutures than you would upstairs for a chest tube.
look, I get that you're doing all this to learn new skills, but you're only gonna learn so much by being careful.
uh, actually, I would disagree. I think the onlyafe way to...
who wants to stitch me up?
Oh, right here.
you gonna tell me about death and die?
Nope. But I did talk to lexie for you.
and now I need you to do something for me.
what's that?
I need you to tell Mark to keehis little Sloan out of little grey.
is he hitting on you? - No, not my little grey.
Lexie's little Grey. I don't know what's going on with her, but the last thing she needs is Sloan going all man-whore on her.
so you need to tell him to step away from little Grey.
all right. I'll see what I can do.
little Grey, Derek. Little Grey.
did she, uh...
she say good-bye to you?
Nope.
are you okay?
do I look okay?
you look great.
then I'm okay.
So...there's a 9-day ritual to--to undo a haunting?
it starts with a 9-day ritual. Okay.
are you really gonna waste nine days on this?
Dr. Stevens. - Yes.
why are you sonterested in my haunting?
Can...can ghosts do things?
I mean, can they make things happen in your life?
I--I've had two cases with two patients in a row that have really reminded me of my dead fianc?
heart transplants and l-vads and-- could he be doing that?
could he be bringing them to me?
Izzie, come on.
is he here right now, your ghost?
I...
I hate to ask, but...
Oh, you don't want me in your surgery.
it's not that I think there's something wrong with you.
it's just...
I don't need any extra ghosts in my operating room.
Mr. Miller. - What does a guy have to do to get a little peace and quiet around here?
the fatigue you're feeling is from the blood loss.
the queasiness, the dizziness-- it's because you're slowly bleeding to death.
what, are you trying to scare him?
no.
I'm trying to ascertain whether he's suicidal or just defeated.
Mr. Miller, you survived in the streets, so I know you're a fighter.
that doesn't make me a fighter.
it makes me lucky.
how long you been out there, 10 years, 20?
you're not in jail, you're not dead. That's not luck. You're smart.
you gotta be smart to take care of yourself on your own.
I guess. - This...
what you're doing right now, Mr. Miller, refusing surgery, it's not smart.
there's a rehab center not too far from here.
Medire takes care of it. You could stay there.
food, bed, long as you need.
just let us operate.
let us operate, and we'll figure the rest out.
that's the fastest I've ever seen anyone dissect through adhesions.
uh, Dr. Dixon, there is a rule, uh, regarding giving medical waste to the patient.
Dr. Dixon?
what?
uh, I was just saying there is a rule, an official, very, very specific rule, that in the event a patient asks for their organ or body part back for any reason related to or involving theicultural beliefs, we must respect that patient's wishes, and return that organ to the patient.
that is the rule I forgot to tell you about.
if I went down to pathology right now, would they know about the rule?
Oh, the chief would know. Uh, it's his rule.
he declared it.
a rule's a rule.
Dr. Karev...
make sure that...
we follow the chief's rule and return the heart to the patient after the surgery.
I'm going ck to work now.
clamp.
what the hell is that gooey thing they're taking out of him?
the silent treatment.
okay, if you're gonna be that way. I'll just, uh...
I'll just stand here and--and be quiet.
okay, but that...that is disgusting.
I thought you were gonna be quiet.
you know, you're acting like you don't want me to be here.
you know what I've wished for every day since you've died?
I've wished that I could see you again.
I'd have given anything just to see you...
one more time.
looking at you and knowing that I can't touch you, it's hurting me.
Izzie, you can touch me.
you're not real.
you can't be real.
so that means that I'm sick or something is wrong with me, and I can't hope for that.
I...
I can't hope.
you're not real.
Izzie, I am as real as you or that gooey, disgusting thing down there.
touch me.
touch me. I'll prove it to you.
No!
why are you here?
I am here for you, Izzie Stevens.
clamp.
okay, that's it.
the donor heart is separated.
we have the cannulas ready for bypass.
next step is the l.vad - y...what...what is that?
that's not right.
that can't be happening.
his heart's beating. How is his heart beating on its own?
it...can't be happening.
it shouldn't be happening.
that heart is beating.
that heart is beating. It shouldn't be beating. It sh-shouldn't be beating.
I've never seen a reconstruction like this. Well, I've never done one like this.
here's hoping it works.
all right. I'm ready for the rod. How are you guys doing up there?
a lot of hemorrhaging, bleeding through the packing.
try the fibrin sealant.
good call. Thank you, DR. Shepherd.
how you doin' on that lac, little grey?
good. Moving on to the next lac.
you finished already? Let me see.
pulley stitches.
nicely done.
thank you, DR. Sloan.
so my heart...
it started beating by itself.
if it continues to function like this, you won't need an l-vad or any other kind of machinery.
it's wonderful news.
it's very atypical.
not for me.
I'm finally free.
I'm not haunted anymore.
your heart had six years to rest, which is...
probably enough time for it to repair itself, which is why it started beating again.
I've never seen this before. I've read about it, but I've never seen it before.
you have your beliefs.
I have mine.
I don't have beliefs.
I have science.
science is a belief, a belief in only what you can see and touch.
I believe in more.
just thought I'd stop in to see how everything's going.
well, I'm still several hours away, but I may actually pull this off-- rebuilding a man's skeleton from scratch.
and we just found out that, uh, DR. Grey here can out-pulley stitch shepherd.
Oh, I wouldn't go so f as to say that.
excellent job, Dr. Grey.
and excellent job of teaching, Dr. Yang. - Sir?
taking the time to teach yo interns, and they are retaining that knowledge.
I haven't made my decision yet on the solo surgery, but you keep teaching like that, and you're my one to watch.
thank you, sir.
he's crashing. V-fib.
start C. P.R. Push 1 of epi and charge the paddles to 360.
clear.
thank you.
thank you so much.
so what do you do now with the haunted piece? Do you bury it or...
burn it.
actually, my tribe's medicine man will burn it.
I'm not allowed to even touch the smoke.
so does the not-touching thing, does that apply to just the flesh or no, we don't touch their belongings.
we can cleanse jewelry, medals, but fabric, bedding, clothes, books that were owned by the dead, we burn all of it.
spirit can cling to any of it.
Oh, no.
your ghost...
you still don't have anything of his, do you?
time of death--1922.
I built his bones.
you tried.
we all tried.
no, I didn't try. I did it.
I did my part. I built his bones.
I built his bones from scratch, and you...
all of you, you were supposed to keep him alive.
that is all you people had to do. You just had to...
keep his body breathing.
you just had to keep him safe and--and breathing and living until I made his bones.
I made...
I made his bones...until...until I made his bones.
I made his bones. I made his bones.
why don't you guys go ahead, and I'll help Dr. Torres clean up?
go call the morgue. - We've got it. Go.
everyone, clear out.
uh, excellent job today, Dr. Dixon.
excellent...
rule following.
I only have one real area of interest--the human heart.
I love it.
I like its regularity. I know everything there is to know about it.
I like its predictability.
it has rules. Every chamber has a function, every function has a movement.
I like the color.
it's comforting.
are you familiar with Ssperger's Syndrome, Dr. Bailey?
uh, of course.
a significant impairment during social situations...
I'm not good at cues like sarcasm or condescension, but I do know when I'm being manipulated, and I know when I'm being made fun of.
I don't think I like this hospital very much.
I don't think I like this hospital at all.
Ah, that Lexie Grey sure knows how to wrap herself around a suture.
mark, Meredith has some concerns.
well, that's not news. - About Lexie.
apparently Lexie is...
fragile, and getting involved with a superior might make her more fragile, so...
I was talking about her sutures.
keep little Sloan out of little Grey is my point.
what? - Little Sloan does not enter little Grey.
are we clear?- Did you just say
okay, that's just creepy and inaccurate.
big Sloan.
you heading home?
I love you.
I will always love you.
you own a piece of me.
so even though you'll be gone, you will never be forgotten, not by me.
I'm sorry we never got our chance. I'm sorry we never...
got to get married or have children or grow old together.
I wanted that so much.
I wanted to be your wife morehan anything.
why are you telling me this?
I'm trying to let you go so that your soul can be at peace.
but I have peace, Izzie.
I'm here for you.
good-bye, Denny.
I love you. But good-bye.
I can explain.
I did not teach you the parallel pulley stitch. I can barely do that stitch myself.
whatever you guys are doing, shut it down.
do not practice on yourselves. That is insane.
shut it down.
I see you.
I've seen you all day.
I-I see you struggling.
and I know you don't want my help, but let me help you.
whatever it is, I can help.
so let me.
will you burn this for me?
I hate how hard it is.
it's just, like, you get attached to someone, and then they work their way into your life, - and then you wake up one day - suddenly all you can think about is their little...
another round? - Oh, I'll get it.
tell me the stories.
what stories?
the ones you won't let Sadie tell me.
they're ancient history.
humiliating and ridiculous.
ridiculous is a grown man telling another grown man to stay out of a woman's little
you did it?
I did, those exact words.
I did it because...
it was nice to see you sticking up for your sister.
I did it for you. So now you owe me...
a story.
okay, fine.
but you can never tell anyone, ever.
I'm--I'm sorry we lost him, the patient. I'm--I'm sorry.
I don't need you to be sorry.
okay. - I don't need you to be sorry.
okay.- I don't need
all--all right.
the ties that bind us are sometimes impossible to explain.
they connect us even after it seems like the ties should be broken.
some bonds defy distance...
and time...
and logic...
Oh, god. I...I said good-bye.
I b-- I burned the sweater.
Yeah, thanks for that, by the way. I love that sweater.
you made me that sweater.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
Izzie - oh, my god.
stop freaking out. - You're not reaL.
Hey, I told you...
you're not real. - I'm here for you.
you are not real...
Izzie, look at me.
touch me.
you see?
I told you I was real.
Oh, god.
meant to be.
every patient's story starts the same way...
it starts with them being fine.
it starts in the before.
they cling to this moment, this memory of being fine, this before...
don't worry.- As though talking about it might somehow brg it back.
we're gonna take care of him.- Long time.
Naomi. we've got an I. C.U. Bed all ready for him.
but whathey don't realize is that the fact at they're talking about it to us, their doctors...
Oh, yesterday, he was fine.
we went to lunch. I thought he was fine.- Means there's no going back.
by the time they see us... they're already in the after.
what the hell are you doing?
the interns are broken.
they've been punished for taking out their own appendixes, and it's making them hate medicine.
they're lost right now and they've forgotten that this thing they hate is actually a thing they love, so I'm gonna remind them.
is this about Denny?
is this some kind of dead-boyfriend art therapy?
this is not about Denny.
it's about the interns.- Who cares about the interns?
they're a bunch of losers.- They're not!
they're no they're just... oh!
they need to have a little fun, and so do I.
where are the damn scissors?
they're right in front of you.
right.
Iz.- Will you hand me that large bowel, please?
okay, See? It's gonna be great.
does he know how he got the parasite?
he thinks he got it from eating unwashed fruit in mexico.
he's bradycardic.
why is he bradycardic and hypotensive?
he's having a reaction to the fentany drip.
stop the fentanyl drip and push the narcan.
wait. Derek, he was in status.
I mean, if you take him off the drip and he's seizes up, there could be permanent brain damage.
we better hope that doesn't happen.
hope? That--that's what your plan is--is hinging on, hoping that--that the worst doesn't happen?
Yeah, I'm hoping he's stopped seizing, because i know if we don't reverse the drip, his heart is going to arrest.
so unless you have a better idea... push the narcan.
and while every patient's story starts the same way...
how the story ends depends on us, on how well we diagnosis and treat.
we know the story hinges on us...
he's in v-fib. Get the crash cart.
and we all want to be the hero.
dr morning, chief.
I heard there was a guy here with worms in his brain.
does anyone know the medical term for rms in the brain?
Dr. Stevens red esteyou today for a special project.
okay, take an envelope, and then pass the rest back, but do not open them.
you're gonna need them for the first game we're gonna play.
that's what we're doing today, playing games?
cheer up. We are gonna have so much fun.
I said don't open the envelope!
don't you know how to play a simple game?
I d when I was 8.
let's just go.
thank you.
Dr. Bailey's with addison today, so I'm gonna hand out your morning assignments.
Addison's in the hospital?
her brother was admitted last night with parasites in his brain.
Addison's brother has neurocysticercosis?
see?
that's what I'm talking about.
I cleared my schedule.
Oh, you didn't he to do that. I'm--I'm fine.
your brother has parasites in his brain.
I cleared my schedule. You cut your hair.
Oh, yeah.
I like it.
uh, Dr. Miranda Bailey.
Oh, I'm sorry. Um, Miranda, Naomi. Naomi, Miranda.
Naomi's our fertility, uh, specialist down at oceanside wellness and one of my oldest friends.
it's nice to meet you, Miranda.
so how is he?- Oh, I don't know.
he's groggy, his eyes are open, but I don't think he's awake because he hasn't tried to kill me.
her brother hates me.
people pick sides in a divorce, Derek.
he picked sides in thearriage.
he first seized during sex with his girlfriend.
I wonder why she's not here.
Oh, she is.
I'm going in there.
you and Archer?
no.
uh, well, yeah. I mean, I don't-- I don't know.
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know wha- we are.
how's sam?
Sam's good.
and, uh, how's, um... Meredith--is that her name?
she's good.
good.- Yeah.
well, look at us. We're standing here making polite conversation about your girlfriend.
you two are divorced, me and sam are divorced, and I'm with Archer, sort of.
what the hell happened?
I mean, you--you wrote addison a song, derek.
can we just forget about the song? Enough about the song.
what? You wrote her her own love song and you sang it to her at the wedding.
mark wrote it or Sam-- somebody. I don't remember who it was.
I do. I do.
I was drunk at the time, but I remember, and I remember thinking you guys were gonna last forever, that we were all gonna last forever.
Yeah.
you should call Sam.
he misses you.- Yeah.
how'd you sleep?
not too well.
shoulder pain?
no. Pain-in-the-ass wi.- No.
I kept him up all night because I was afraid my aneurysm was gonna explode and I was gonna die.
Hi, I'm Dr. Karev.
well, where's dr. Grey? She's supposed to be in my surgery.
uh, she and Dr. Shepherd got called in on an emergency.
so it looks like he's not gonna get to your aneurysm until later.
Wh--later when?
could be a few hours, it could even be tomorrow.
tomorrow? I mean, she's already waited till tom--today is tomorrow.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
I'm her husband. Oh, I look like this because
I ran him over with our car before I knew I had this huge time bomb in my head, when I was just a big ol' pregnant person waiting for her baby.
so... just, please, if dr. Shepherd could, you know, get to me sooner rather than later.
what's the emergency?
Addison's brother.
Addison's here?
we were having dinner, and he just passed out.
I am telling you, it is probably just my hernia.
uh, he has an inguinal hernia, but it doesn't seem to be the source of the obstruction.
you know, honey, it's gonna take these doctors a long time to figure this out, all right?
I am fine here.
now you gotta go to work.
he hates it when we try to help him.
he's a l like my second graders that way.
okay, daddy, you win. And I have my cell.
so call me if you need me.
okay. Bye.
I have colorectal cancer.
I've had five polyps removed in the last three years, and radiation.
my daughter doesn't know, and I would like to keep it that way.
Dr. Yang is gonna set you up for a C. T.With contrast.
where have you been treated? We'll need to get your medical records.
columbia hospital in verona, and dr. Shulty.
I, uh... I work here now.
I saw that you were in and I thought I
you waited till she left to come in and say hello.
that's just like you to face up to things like a man.
you should really tell her about the cancer, Michael.
she deserves to know.- You lost the right to tell me anything about her when you broke off your engagement in a 2-line e-mail.
our eyes met over the cadaver and I knew I had to have her what was the next line?
can we talk about something else?
had his mitral valve grown too thick?
is that what made our cadaver so sick?
cause I wrote that line.
Oh, my bad.
no, no, it's fine.
I, uh... I think it sounds like a fine song.
Archie, I heard you were gonna let derek remove those little suckers from your brain.
Maybe.- he is.
I hate surgery, especially brain surgery.
Yeah.
being a neurologist, you probably see a lot of patients post-op who are just, you know, - scrambled eggs up there-- Okay, you know what, Mark? You're not helping right now.
we're sitting here trying to convince him that surgery is
is not an option.
according to these scans, the single cyst that you had in your last C. T.
has now multiplied by eight, all clogging the third ventricle.
there's no way I can surgically navigate through a mess like that without rupturing one.
so what does that mean?
you're in a room full of doctors, addison, who are all being very quiet right now.
I'm gonna die.
that's what it means.
is the name of a surgery.
your task is to drape your patients accordingly.
on your marks. Get set. Go.
come on, people. Lighten up. This is supposed to be fun.
don't take it so serusly.
you suck at this! My grandmother could drape better than you.
I'm sorry. I'll--I'll try to do better next time.
no, no. I'm just-- you're doing great.
I'm--I'm trash-talking.
I'm having fun. It's just-- I'm--it's fun.
what do you...
lookin' good.
good job.- Done.
good... - laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
Yeah, that's good. Here.- Yes.
your, uh, next challenge- Me, too. I'm done, too.
a whipple is for pancreatic cancer.
were you planning on going in through the mouth?
start over.
there's just no way, addie.
I talked to Conroy at Cedars, Larry at Mayo, and they agree. There'd just be
I put... you in A... tiny box.
after the divorce, I made you... petty and inconsequential and nothing special so that you could fit into this tiny...
little box that would help me get out of bed in the morning.
but now... now I have to take you out of the box because...
I need to believe that, uh, you can do this, that you can save my brother.
I need you to be a god.
just today... be a god.
uh, Montgomery, Archer.
I'm a friend.
I'm Dr. Miranda Bailey. I'm a friend of addison's.
which one are you?- I'm sorry?
archer is addison's brother, and archer's girlfriend is addison's best friend, o used to be married to derek's best friend, who derek hasn't spoken to ...
since the divorce.- Right, right.
well, that would be me, the ex-husband.
uh, Dr. Samuel bennett.
sorry.
well, I didn't think the ex-husband would show up at the ex-wife's boyfriend's bedside.
right. Don't worry about it. Uh, even I don't know why I'm here.
but, uh, yeah.- Third floor. Room 3420.
thank you.
Dr. Bennett.
uh, Sam.- Dr. Sheprd is still studying the scans, looking for a way to operate, but it looks like a difficult case.
right.
you know, addison's brother probably isn't gonna make it.
his cysts are inoperable.
worms in the brain-- not how you want to go.
I didn't even know addison had a brother.
I mean, you'd think Derek would've said something at some point or sang something while he played his guitar.
speak english.- Oh, Derek used to play the guitar.
Owen's ex-fianc is in the hospital.
his ex-fianc he never told me about.
what's wrong with her?
well, she calls her dad "daddy.
no. What's wrong with her? Why is she in the hospital?
Oh, she isn't.
daddy is.
Hey, you know, you should ask owen if he plays the guitar.
find Dr. Sloan."He's your patient. Ask him his sympto.
diagnose him correctly to receive your next challenge." What are your symptoms?
well, right now I'm battling a rapid heart rate.
I'm also feeling a little flushed.
I don't even want to mention what's going on below the belt.
Hey, no. I-I-I don't do dirty, secret flirting with you anymore.
okay? I-I told you, if you want to go public with me, with us, then I will do dirty, public flirting.
I mean, I will--I will flirt publicly, not dirtily.
maybe a little dirtily.
will you--would you please tell me your symptoms so I can concentrate?
tachycardia, angiodema,"hypotension, severe chest and abdominal pain, difficulty breathing and throat clo--" anaphylactic shock!
Foul.- What?
you heard her answer.
well, the whole hospital heard her answer.
well, you should kept a respectful distance. New symptoms. Resume play.
all right. You must have questions, so ask.
when was his last polypectomy? Since you're familiar with the patient.
that's not what I meant.- No, I know what you meant.
Dr. Yang, what are your symptoms?- Now is not a good time.
heavy feeling in the abdomen accompanied by nausea and acute pulling sensation in the scrotum.
uh, testicular cancer.
Cristina-- I have to get mr. Whitman to C. T.
I wasn't doing anyone any good at school, so...
I don't understand.
What...- I work here.
wh-what do you mean?
what do you mean?
Beth...- when did you get back?
I-I-I just saw your mom. She didn't s
I thought you were in Iraq.
I--I've been praying for you every night.
every night I'm on my knees praying that y-you're gonna make it back, that you'll make it another 24 hours, that you'll... you'll make it home.
you're back.
what is she doing?
it looks like she's praying.
mm, no. Addie doesn't pray
what is she doing?
uh, she's praying.
no, Addison doesn't pray. She must be hiding.
I can hear you.
and I'm not hiding. I am trying to pray, but I don't know how to pray because I'm a wasp, and we only go to church on christmas.
you guys go. I got this.
I have no clout with god.
God doesn't even know who I am, which sucks, because I could...
I could use some help.
dear god, I need your guidance.
I kissed a peds surgeon.
you kissed a peds surgeon?
I never thought I'd end up with a woman, god, but--I mean, not until lately-- but that--that's not the problem.
the problem is the peds thing. She's--she's perky...
and has butterflies on her scrub cap.
but she's... also hot... really hot.
so... help me get over the butterflies.
Amen.
you're an amazing doctor. You save babies. God knows who you are.
do you really believe in all this... in god?
sometimes.
well... most of the time, when it counts.
your wife's in the chapel praying.
she's not my wife, and she doesn't pray.
how are you?
good. Oh, you know, midlife crisis.
I got an earring. I got an earring.
but I-I let the hole closep the very next day.
Oh, that woulda--woulda been a good look on you.
I met, uh, Meredith.
she's not a midlife crisis.
she's the real thing.
that's great. I'm happy for you, man.
I'm happy for you.- yeah.
I shoulda called.- No.
no, I should've stayed in touch. It's my fault.
Hey, people move, they change.
you know, we all did.- Yeah.
so... but yeah.
she's praying.
Yeah.
she's expecting a miracle... and I can't deliver one.
I've seen patients with one cyst in the ventricle, maybe two.
he has eight.
there is no way I can get a scope in there without rupturing one.
there's too many.
maybe you're just too close to it.
what if there were just one?
you know, explain to me how you would remove just that one.
110 over 80.
what's the prize for winning?
they need a prize.
they're getting a prize, a really big prize.
I need a prize.
what's going on?
uh, my patients needed a distraction, and, uh, izzie needed real patients.
so how's it going?- It's going great.
super fun. We're having a lot of fun.
Dr. Grey.
Oh, my god. Am I going to surgery now?
could be any time now, Jen.
what?
I can't find it.
wait... is something wrong?
is the baby's heart not beating?
what-- you're on the kid's ass.
the heart's over here.
thank god.
it's not what you think.
I can guarantee I'm not as much of an ass as you think I am.
does your mother know you're back?
page me when this is done.
I need to create room in the ventricle so I can maneuver the scope.
if I deflate each cyst, the scope can remove them one by one.
the cysts will rupture.
I'm gonna grab each one with forceps, pull it up to the edge of the port and suction out the fluid.
the suction would have to be precise-- it will be.
you can't do it.- Well, I think I can.
basically you can control the way thcyst ruptures?
no, he can't.
look, I know you guys want me to go down fighting, but I-- coward.
excuse me?
I said "coward." You're a coward by trade. You're a neurologist.
you guys feed off us, refer your patients to us, let us assume the responsibility, and if god forbid something happens, well... I'll tell you what, I can assume the responsibility.
the question is, can you?
peds surgery fellowship?
Yep, just when I'm almost done with my general surgery residency.
crazy, huh?
no, just, uh... surprising.
uh, you don't seem lik a-a peds person to me.
why not?
because you don't smile.
peds people smile.- I smile.
well, I'm not going to smile right now, but I do smile.
I smile frequently.
he under yet?
Yeah.
a peds surgery fellowship?
I have a child. I'm familiar with children.
I am going to be an excellent pediatric surgeon.
you're gonna want to keep that temper in check around the kids.
weird seeing archie on that table.
Yeah.
asma.
looks like I'm low.
Krez, refill this for dr. Bennett here.
Thanks.
it's good practice.
asthma's big with the kids.
say it, Derek. Come on, say it. Say it. Say it. Say it. Say it. Say it.
okay, everybody. It's a beautiful day to save lives.
scalpel.
at some point, you're gonna have to tell her.
this is Beth we're talking about.
she worries herself sick when one of her students gets the sniffles.
she can't handle bad news.
she's a sunshine girl.
and you used to know that about her.
well, she'll find out eventually.
Dr. Yang.
what's going on?
Ruthcall the chief and reserve an O. R.- Owen
it's A... I-it's a cplication.
he needs surgery.
but what... a c--a complication from what?
he's gonna be okay.
I'll keep you update let's go.
okay, entering the third ventricle.
all right. Securing cyst number one.
deflating cyst one.
all right. Suction.
any sign of the scolex?
there it is.
one at a time. One at a time.
okay.
I need to be distracted.
someone, um, talk about something other than what's going on with my brother right now.
uh, Mark is good at talking about himself.
actually, I've been using endoscopy for head and neck cancer resections, and if I could just focus the criteria for patients, I might have a breakthrough on my hands.
what happened to you?
he met someone.
Dr. Grey.
Dr. Torres said I, uh, had to eat. I'm sorry.
no, it's okay. How is it?
it's amazing.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
it's bland. It's really bland.
I need my surgery, now!
what kind of hospital is this? How long am I supposed to wait?
because-- look, stop it!
look, uh... if you don't settle down, your blood pressure's gonna rise, and you're gonna start contracting.
I'm sorry because I don't know you, but you really need to shut up, okay?
all right. There.
look.
there's your son's face.
that's what you need to hold on to for the next couple of hours, okay?
let's see here.
is--is that a tumor?
he's gonna need moreggressive treatment.
he'll have to tell his daughter now.- he won't.
her mother died when she was little.
he feels that's enough sadness for anyone, so... he sheltered her.
she always had a nice car, nice clothes, anything she wanted.
well, she'll find out eventually.
she used to call me in tears when there was a spider in her apartment.
it became a joke between Michael and I.
neither of us could be out of town at the same time in case Beth found a bug.
well, when he needs to go through chemo or gets so sick he needs hospice care, she'll find out when it's already over.
she deserves more than that.
okay, Dr. Grey, what's the number?
seven cysts, seven scolexes.
okay, then one more.
damn it.
he's getting bradycardic.
I need to irrigate, see if the flow is blocked.
asystole.
start the code clock.
Derek, asystole.
where the hell is it?
get the crash cart. Starting compressions.
No,Stop! Nobody move.
we can't start compressions. I need to find the worm.
but he's--we have two minutes, maybe three.
nobody move. Just stop.
how long has he been down?
2 minutes, 20 seconds.
it's starting to tear apart.
maybe if I just rotate it and reverse it back.
and that's number eight.
heart rate's coming back up.
okay.
thank you, everybody.
you just made some friends of mine very happy.
I just got out of surgery. What's going on?
could be any minute now.- She needs a prize.
a big prize, but not too big, because they did take out their own appendixes.
and I understand they're still being punished for that and that you think they're not even qualified to hold a clamp, so... do you have any prizes like that?
thank you. They just got their symptoms from their final patients.
get outhe finish line. It's gonna be close.
here they come!
all right, alright, all right! Come on, run!
come on! Come on! Come on, come on! Bring it in!
move! Move!- George?
3-way tie.
okay, final patient diagnosis.- Motion sickness!
no.- Dengue fever!
no!- Neurocysticercosis!
yay!- ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner.
nicely done.
Yes!
wait, what's the prize?
you get to scrub in on Shepherd's craniotomy...- yes!
and hold the doomsday sucker.
what's the doomsday sucker?
doomsday sucker?
it's just a really big sucker.- Yeah!
it was a hard surgery.
some of the bowel was dead, as we suspected, but we were able to remove the diseased part successfully.
he's in recovery, and you can see him in about an hour.
you don't even look like yourself.
excuse me?
you don't.
you look... hard.
and... look, I-I know it-- it wasn't easy over there.
I-I hear people come back and...
I know you can't just come back and be normal right away, - but-- he'll be asleep for a couple of hours, but you can see him now.
two lines in an e-il?
I deserve more than that.
Beth, your dad has colorectal cancer.
he's already been through radiation treatment and polyp removals.
he didn't tell you... 'cause he didn't want to burden you.
he'd like to spare you any pain...
any more pain.
he had all these friends.
they sang and they played guitar and...
it's almost like he was a totally different person.
well, he was.
it kind a freaks me out a little bit.
I feel like I don't know him.
and I don't know owen.
we don't. We don't know them.
hold up. Hold up. Hold up.
I just wanted to let you know, um, I'm happy to help you if you'd like
you know, reviewing the basics or putting in some supervised skills lab hours.
excuse me?
well, I... I was a repeater earlier this year. I know how easy it is to get behind.
I don't need a tutor.
you don't?- No.
at this point in your training, you should be able to hear symptoms, diagnose the problem and decide whether or not a patient needs surgery.
can you do that?
can you?
because think you can, and they will put you in situations where you have to.
Sadie, you could hurt someone.
I call her.
all right? I call my mother once a week.
I haven't told her that I'm back. She thinks that I'm calling from...
I keep the conversations short because I can't bear for her to know that the son she sent off to war is gone.
he's gone.
and if I just got in my car and drove the six miles to see her, she'd be so sad, and she would look at me the same way that beth does now...
like I'm not there.
the only time I don't feel like a ost is when you look at me because you look at me and you see me. You see me.
this is me. This is me.
please, Cristina, see me.
see me.
Jen, I am so sorry.
I have you scheduled for first thing tomorrow morning.
Derek... uh, I'm using your first name now...
because I like you a lot and I'm starting to consider us friends, - so I'm using your first name and I'm calling you derek.- Okay.
and, Derek, I'm begging you, please, please, please don't make me wait another night.
she's good. Try being married to her. You'll never say no again.
Dr. Grey.
it would appear that congratulations are in order.
thank you, dr. Sloan.
I'd also like it acknowledged that I offer these congratulations professionally and respectfully... without any innuendo or inappropriate body language.
acknowledged, Dr. Sloan.
doou know, what's a dooms day sucker?
mark, Addie, little Grey.- Little Grey?
I am gonna have to meet you at Joe's in a bit.
I have a craniotomy.
little Grey, I hear you're gonna be holding the doomsday sucker.
now? Great. Yeah, yeah, yes. Yes, sir.
O. R.Two. I'll see you there.- Okay.
doomsday sucker!
can you believe little Grey and, uh
Hey, did you hear derek was gonna propose to Meredith?
how about that?- And I'm off to surgery.
what?
Iz... what's going on with you?
nothing.
I'm fine.
you saw. The interns are not a bunch of losers.
they know things. They're gonna make good doctors.
really, I'm fine.
I'm fine.
she knows nothing.
just... nothing.
she's a danger to the patients, and so I told her that she could tell the chief or I could, and I wanted to let you know because you're her friend.
although for the life of me, I... I don't know how you two were ever friends.
what happened?
I quit.
O'malley's a little narc.
I'd rather be deemed a quitter than a cheater.
did you cheat your way into the program?
listen, I'm not book smart.
you know that.
I learn on my feet.
I thought if I came to where you were, you could...- pull you through.
we've seen each otherthrough a lot.
we're not 25, sleeping our way through europe anymore.
we could though.
think about it. We could get on a plane tonight.
we could go-- no, no.
I can't.
I have to work.
I can't just...
wow, you know...
they've sucked the life right out the meredith I used to know
is right here.
I'm here.
I just don't want to sleep my way through europe anymore.
I want to be here. I want to be here.
sucker at the ready?
sucker's at the ready.
you're mocking me.
only a little.
damn it. damn it.
what, what happened?
B. P.Ov 88 er 60. - Hang 2 units of blood.
okay, all joking aside, dr. Grey, bring in the doomsday sucker.
okay. Put it right in there. Right in here. Get in there.
Oh, my god.
okay. Microsutures, please.
B. P. I110 over 72.
okay, get the sucker out of there.
is that it? Did you--did you get it?
there's good flow.
Yes, we did it.
and that will teach me never to mock an eager young intern again.
I'm an ass.
you are such an ass.
I shouldn't have blurted.
a little warning would have been nice.
but you're okay?
you know, it's strange. I... I expected this horrible feeling, this wave of sadness or something to just take over, but... people get divorced... they meet new people, they remarry.
I don't know. You know, maybe it just.
seeing archer in that O. R.It just... 
changed my perspective or something.
but you sort of wished it'd been you first.
Oh, shut it.
so what, are you gonna ll derek about the-- okay, wait, wait.
if we call meredith the 12 year old, what--what do we call lexie, a preschooler?
she's a woman.
Oh, okay.- And I'm gonna tell him.
I'm working on it.
there he is!-oh, there you go.
that's the kind of welcome I deserve.
Joe, scotch for the neuro god.
you... you were a god today.
you were a god in that O. R.
you slew dragons, you walked on water.
you... you were a god, but now...
now you need to get very tiny again...
and go back in the box.
how--how was your craniotomy?
it was fine.- Yeah?
Yeah, and I stopped in on archer on my way out.
things are, uh, good.
good.
had his mitral valve gotten too thick?
Oh, god. Shut up.
is that what made the cadaver so sick?
but we can't-- wait, we can't remember the chorus. Come on.
Yeah, we got all the way through the second verse... no.
no.- Yes, yes.
your name starts the chorus. Your name-- yes, yes.
Addison montgomery- he met her in the summery it wasn't "summery.
I'd never use summery as a noun.
I met her... in the summer, she...- oh, summer, she--really?
Yeah.
summer, she," well.
that's clever.
she was... cutting up a very dead body this is why I don't stay in touch.
and in her eyes, I saw my life I knew that she would be my wife and she would breathe the life back into me ooh for every day until eternity or until I'd be as dead as that body - body - ah, jeez.
Yeah, you got it.
there you go. There you go.
Oh, help us. Cheers. Wonderful.
God.
what's happening?
every patient's story starts the same way...
it starts with them being fine.
it starts in the before.
they cling to this moment, this memory of being fine, this before...
don't worry.- As though talking about it might somehow brg it back.
we're gonna take care of him.- Long time.
Naomi. we've got an I. C.U. Bed all ready for him.
but whathey don't realize is that the fact at they're talking about it to us, their doctors...
Oh, yesterday, he was fine.
we went to lunch. I thought he was fine.- Means there's no going back.
by the time they see us... they're already in the after.
what the hell are you doing?
the interns are broken.
they've been punished for taking out their own appendixes, and it's making them hate medicine.
they're lost right now and they've forgotten that this thing they hate is actually a thing they love, so I'm gonna remind them.
is this about Denny?
is this some kind of dead-boyfriend art therapy?
this is not about Denny.
it's about the interns.- Who cares about the interns?
they're a bunch of losers.- They're not!
they're no they're just... oh!
they need to have a little fun, and so do I.
where are the damn scissors?
they're right in front of you.
right.
Iz.- Will you hand me that large bowel, please?
okay, See? It's gonna be great.
does he know how he got the parasite?
he thinks he got it from eating unwashed fruit in mexico.
he's bradycardic.
why is he bradycardic and hypotensive?
he's having a reaction to the fentany drip.
stop the fentanyl drip and push the narcan.
wait. Derek, he was in status.
I mean, if you take him off the drip and he's seizes up, there could be permanent brain damage.
we better hope that doesn't happen.
hope? That--that's what your plan is--is hinging on, hoping that--that the worst doesn't happen?
Yeah, I'm hoping he's stopped seizing, because i know if we don't reverse the drip, his heart is going to arrest.
so unless you have a better idea... push the narcan.
and while every patient's story starts the same way...
how the story ends depends on us, on how well we diagnosis and treat.
we know the story hinges on us...
he's in v-fib. Get the crash cart.
and we all want to be the hero.
dr morning, chief.
I heard there was a guy here with worms in his brain.
does anyone know the medical term for rms in the brain?
Dr. Stevens red esteyou today for a special project.
okay, take an envelope, and then pass the rest back, but do not open them.
you're gonna need them for the first game we're gonna play.
that's what we're doing today, playing games?
cheer up. We are gonna have so much fun.
I said don't open the envelope!
don't you know how to play a simple game?
I d when I was 8.
let's just go.
thank you.
Dr. Bailey's with addison today, so I'm gonna hand out your morning assignments.
Addison's in the hospital?
her brother was admitted last night with parasites in his brain.
Addison's brother has neurocysticercosis?
see?
that's what I'm talking about.
I cleared my schedule.
Oh, you didn't he to do that. I'm--I'm fine.
your brother has parasites in his brain.
I cleared my schedule. You cut your hair.
Oh, yeah.
I like it.
uh, Dr. Miranda Bailey.
Oh, I'm sorry. Um, Miranda, Naomi. Naomi, Miranda.
Naomi's our fertility, uh, specialist down at oceanside wellness and one of my oldest friends.
it's nice to meet you, Miranda.
so how is he?- Oh, I don't know.
he's groggy, his eyes are open, but I don't think he's awake because he hasn't tried to kill me.
her brother hates me.
people pick sides in a divorce, Derek.
he picked sides in thearriage.
he first seized during sex with his girlfriend.
I wonder why she's not here.
Oh, she is.
I'm going in there.
you and Archer?
no.
uh, well, yeah. I mean, I don't-- I don't know.
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know wha- we are.
how's sam?
Sam's good.
and, uh, how's, um... Meredith--is that her name?
she's good.
good.- Yeah.
well, look at us. We're standing here making polite conversation about your girlfriend.
you two are divorced, me and sam are divorced, and I'm with Archer, sort of.
what the hell happened?
I mean, you--you wrote addison a song, derek.
can we just forget about the song? Enough about the song.
what? You wrote her her own love song and you sang it to her at the wedding.
mark wrote it or Sam-- somebody. I don't remember who it was.
I do. I do.
I was drunk at the time, but I remember, and I remember thinking you guys were gonna last forever, that we were all gonna last forever.
Yeah.
you should call Sam.
he misses you.- Yeah.
how'd you sleep?
not too well.
shoulder pain?
no. Pain-in-the-ass wi.- No.
I kept him up all night because I was afraid my aneurysm was gonna explode and I was gonna die.
Hi, I'm Dr. Karev.
well, where's dr. Grey? She's supposed to be in my surgery.
uh, she and Dr. Shepherd got called in on an emergency.
so it looks like he's not gonna get to your aneurysm until later.
Wh--later when?
could be a few hours, it could even be tomorrow.
tomorrow? I mean, she's already waited till tom--today is tomorrow.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
I'm her husband. Oh, I look like this because
I ran him over with our car before I knew I had this huge time bomb in my head, when I was just a big ol' pregnant person waiting for her baby.
so... just, please, if dr. Shepherd could, you know, get to me sooner rather than later.
what's the emergency?
Addison's brother.
Addison's here?
we were having dinner, and he just passed out.
I am telling you, it is probably just my hernia.
uh, he has an inguinal hernia, but it doesn't seem to be the source of the obstruction.
you know, honey, it's gonna take these doctors a long time to figure this out, all right?
I am fine here.
now you gotta go to work.
he hates it when we try to help him.
he's a l like my second graders that way.
okay, daddy, you win. And I have my cell.
so call me if you need me.
okay. Bye.
I have colorectal cancer.
I've had five polyps removed in the last three years, and radiation.
my daughter doesn't know, and I would like to keep it that way.
Dr. Yang is gonna set you up for a C. T.With contrast.
where have you been treated? We'll need to get your medical records.
columbia hospital in verona, and dr. Shulty.
I, uh... I work here now.
I saw that you were in and I thought I
you waited till she left to come in and say hello.
that's just like you to face up to things like a man.
you should really tell her about the cancer, Michael.
she deserves to know.- You lost the right to tell me anything about her when you broke off your engagement in a 2-line e-mail.
our eyes met over the cadaver and I knew I had to have her what was the next line?
can we talk about something else?
had his mitral valve grown too thick?
is that what made our cadaver so sick?
cause I wrote that line.
Oh, my bad.
no, no, it's fine.
I, uh... I think it sounds like a fine song.
Archie, I heard you were gonna let derek remove those little suckers from your brain.
Maybe.- he is.
I hate surgery, especially brain surgery.
Yeah.
being a neurologist, you probably see a lot of patients post-op who are just, you know, - scrambled eggs up there-- Okay, you know what, Mark? You're not helping right now.
we're sitting here trying to convince him that surgery is
is not an option.
according to these scans, the single cyst that you had in your last C. T.
has now multiplied by eight, all clogging the third ventricle.
there's no way I can surgically navigate through a mess like that without rupturing one.
so what does that mean?
you're in a room full of doctors, addison, who are all being very quiet right now.
I'm gonna die.
that's what it means.
is the name of a surgery.
your task is to drape your patients accordingly.
on your marks. Get set. Go.
come on, people. Lighten up. This is supposed to be fun.
don't take it so serusly.
you suck at this! My grandmother could drape better than you.
I'm sorry. I'll--I'll try to do better next time.
no, no. I'm just-- you're doing great.
I'm--I'm trash-talking.
I'm having fun. It's just-- I'm--it's fun.
what do you...
lookin' good.
good job.- Done.
good... - laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
Yeah, that's good. Here.- Yes.
your, uh, next challenge- Me, too. I'm done, too.
a whipple is for pancreatic cancer.
were you planning on going in through the mouth?
start over.
there's just no way, addie.
I talked to Conroy at Cedars, Larry at Mayo, and they agree. There'd just be
I put... you in A... tiny box.
after the divorce, I made you... petty and inconsequential and nothing special so that you could fit into this tiny...
little box that would help me get out of bed in the morning.
but now... now I have to take you out of the box because...
I need to believe that, uh, you can do this, that you can save my brother.
I need you to be a god.
just today... be a god.
uh, Montgomery, Archer.
I'm a friend.
I'm Dr. Miranda Bailey. I'm a friend of addison's.
which one are you?- I'm sorry?
archer is addison's brother, and archer's girlfriend is addison's best friend, o used to be married to derek's best friend, who derek hasn't spoken to ...
since the divorce.- Right, right.
well, that would be me, the ex-husband.
uh, Dr. Samuel bennett.
sorry.
well, I didn't think the ex-husband would show up at the ex-wife's boyfriend's bedside.
right. Don't worry about it. Uh, even I don't know why I'm here.
but, uh, yeah.- Third floor. Room 3420.
thank you.
Dr. Bennett.
uh, Sam.- Dr. Sheprd is still studying the scans, looking for a way to operate, but it looks like a difficult case.
right.
you know, addison's brother probably isn't gonna make it.
his cysts are inoperable.
worms in the brain-- not how you want to go.
I didn't even know addison had a brother.
I mean, you'd think Derek would've said something at some point or sang something while he played his guitar.
speak english.- Oh, Derek used to play the guitar.
Owen's ex-fianc is in the hospital.
his ex-fianc he never told me about.
what's wrong with her?
well, she calls her dad "daddy.
no. What's wrong with her? Why is she in the hospital?
Oh, she isn't.
daddy is.
Hey, you know, you should ask owen if he plays the guitar.
find Dr. Sloan."He's your patient. Ask him his sympto.
diagnose him correctly to receive your next challenge." What are your symptoms?
well, right now I'm battling a rapid heart rate.
I'm also feeling a little flushed.
I don't even want to mention what's going on below the belt.
Hey, no. I-I-I don't do dirty, secret flirting with you anymore.
okay? I-I told you, if you want to go public with me, with us, then I will do dirty, public flirting.
I mean, I will--I will flirt publicly, not dirtily.
maybe a little dirtily.
will you--would you please tell me your symptoms so I can concentrate?
tachycardia, angiodema,"hypotension, severe chest and abdominal pain, difficulty breathing and throat clo--" anaphylactic shock!
Foul.- What?
you heard her answer.
well, the whole hospital heard her answer.
well, you should kept a respectful distance. New symptoms. Resume play.
all right. You must have questions, so ask.
when was his last polypectomy? Since you're familiar with the patient.
that's not what I meant.- No, I know what you meant.
Dr. Yang, what are your symptoms?- Now is not a good time.
heavy feeling in the abdomen accompanied by nausea and acute pulling sensation in the scrotum.
uh, testicular cancer.
Cristina-- I have to get mr. Whitman to C. T.
I wasn't doing anyone any good at school, so...
I don't understand.
What...- I work here.
wh-what do you mean?
what do you mean?
Beth...- when did you get back?
I-I-I just saw your mom. She didn't s
I thought you were in Iraq.
I--I've been praying for you every night.
every night I'm on my knees praying that y-you're gonna make it back, that you'll make it another 24 hours, that you'll... you'll make it home.
you're back.
what is she doing?
it looks like she's praying.
mm, no. Addie doesn't pray
what is she doing?
uh, she's praying.
no, Addison doesn't pray. She must be hiding.
I can hear you.
and I'm not hiding. I am trying to pray, but I don't know how to pray because I'm a wasp, and we only go to church on christmas.
you guys go. I got this.
I have no clout with god.
God doesn't even know who I am, which sucks, because I could...
I could use some help.
dear god, I need your guidance.
I kissed a peds surgeon.
you kissed a peds surgeon?
I never thought I'd end up with a woman, god, but--I mean, not until lately-- but that--that's not the problem.
the problem is the peds thing. She's--she's perky...
and has butterflies on her scrub cap.
but she's... also hot... really hot.
so... help me get over the butterflies.
Amen.
you're an amazing doctor. You save babies. God knows who you are.
do you really believe in all this... in god?
sometimes.
well... most of the time, when it counts.
your wife's in the chapel praying.
she's not my wife, and she doesn't pray.
how are you?
good. Oh, you know, midlife crisis.
I got an earring. I got an earring.
but I-I let the hole closep the very next day.
Oh, that woulda--woulda been a good look on you.
I met, uh, Meredith.
she's not a midlife crisis.
she's the real thing.
that's great. I'm happy for you, man.
I'm happy for you.- yeah.
I shoulda called.- No.
no, I should've stayed in touch. It's my fault.
Hey, people move, they change.
you know, we all did.- Yeah.
so... but yeah.
she's praying.
Yeah.
she's expecting a miracle... and I can't deliver one.
I've seen patients with one cyst in the ventricle, maybe two.
he has eight.
there is no way I can get a scope in there without rupturing one.
there's too many.
maybe you're just too close to it.
what if there were just one?
you know, explain to me how you would remove just that one.
110 over 80.
what's the prize for winning?
they need a prize.
they're getting a prize, a really big prize.
I need a prize.
what's going on?
uh, my patients needed a distraction, and, uh, izzie needed real patients.
so how's it going?- It's going great.
super fun. We're having a lot of fun.
Dr. Grey.
Oh, my god. Am I going to surgery now?
could be any time now, Jen.
what?
I can't find it.
wait... is something wrong?
is the baby's heart not beating?
what-- you're on the kid's ass.
the heart's over here.
thank god.
it's not what you think.
I can guarantee I'm not as much of an ass as you think I am.
does your mother know you're back?
page me when this is done.
I need to create room in the ventricle so I can maneuver the scope.
if I deflate each cyst, the scope can remove them one by one.
the cysts will rupture.
I'm gonna grab each one with forceps, pull it up to the edge of the port and suction out the fluid.
the suction would have to be precise-- it will be.
you can't do it.- Well, I think I can.
basically you can control the way thcyst ruptures?
no, he can't.
look, I know you guys want me to go down fighting, but I-- coward.
excuse me?
I said "coward." You're a coward by trade. You're a neurologist.
you guys feed off us, refer your patients to us, let us assume the responsibility, and if god forbid something happens, well... I'll tell you what, I can assume the responsibility.
the question is, can you?
peds surgery fellowship?
Yep, just when I'm almost done with my general surgery residency.
crazy, huh?
no, just, uh... surprising.
uh, you don't seem lik a-a peds person to me.
why not?
because you don't smile.
peds people smile.- I smile.
well, I'm not going to smile right now, but I do smile.
I smile frequently.
he under yet?
Yeah.
a peds surgery fellowship?
I have a child. I'm familiar with children.
I am going to be an excellent pediatric surgeon.
you're gonna want to keep that temper in check around the kids.
weird seeing archie on that table.
Yeah.
asma.
looks like I'm low.
Krez, refill this for dr. Bennett here.
Thanks.
it's good practice.
asthma's big with the kids.
say it, Derek. Come on, say it. Say it. Say it. Say it. Say it. Say it.
okay, everybody. It's a beautiful day to save lives.
scalpel.
at some point, you're gonna have to tell her.
this is Beth we're talking about.
she worries herself sick when one of her students gets the sniffles.
she can't handle bad news.
she's a sunshine girl.
and you used to know that about her.
well, she'll find out eventually.
Dr. Yang.
what's going on?
Ruthcall the chief and reserve an O. R.- Owen
it's A... I-it's a cplication.
he needs surgery.
but what... a c--a complication from what?
he's gonna be okay.
I'll keep you update let's go.
okay, entering the third ventricle.
all right. Securing cyst number one.
deflating cyst one.
all right. Suction.
any sign of the scolex?
there it is.
one at a time. One at a time.
okay.
I need to be distracted.
someone, um, talk about something other than what's going on with my brother right now.
uh, Mark is good at talking about himself.
actually, I've been using endoscopy for head and neck cancer resections, and if I could just focus the criteria for patients, I might have a breakthrough on my hands.
what happened to you?
he met someone.
Dr. Grey.
Dr. Torres said I, uh, had to eat. I'm sorry.
no, it's okay. How is it?
it's amazing.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
it's bland. It's really bland.
I need my surgery, now!
what kind of hospital is this? How long am I supposed to wait?
because-- look, stop it!
look, uh... if you don't settle down, your blood pressure's gonna rise, and you're gonna start contracting.
I'm sorry because I don't know you, but you really need to shut up, okay?
all right. There.
look.
there's your son's face.
that's what you need to hold on to for the next couple of hours, okay?
let's see here.
is--is that a tumor?
he's gonna need moreggressive treatment.
he'll have to tell his daughter now.- he won't.
her mother died when she was little.
he feels that's enough sadness for anyone, so... he sheltered her.
she always had a nice car, nice clothes, anything she wanted.
well, she'll find out eventually.
she used to call me in tears when there was a spider in her apartment.
it became a joke between Michael and I.
neither of us could be out of town at the same time in case Beth found a bug.
well, when he needs to go through chemo or gets so sick he needs hospice care, she'll find out when it's already over.
she deserves more than that.
okay, Dr. Grey, what's the number?
seven cysts, seven scolexes.
okay, then one more.
damn it.
he's getting bradycardic.
I need to irrigate, see if the flow is blocked.
asystole.
start the code clock.
Derek, asystole.
where the hell is it?
get the crash cart. Starting compressions.
No,Stop! Nobody move.
we can't start compressions. I need to find the worm.
but he's--we have two minutes, maybe three.
nobody move. Just stop.
how long has he been down?
2 minutes, 20 seconds.
it's starting to tear apart.
maybe if I just rotate it and reverse it back.
and that's number eight.
heart rate's coming back up.
okay.
thank you, everybody.
you just made some friends of mine very happy.
I just got out of surgery. What's going on?
could be any minute now.- She needs a prize.
a big prize, but not too big, because they did take out their own appendixes.
and I understand they're still being punished for that and that you think they're not even qualified to hold a clamp, so... do you have any prizes like that?
thank you. They just got their symptoms from their final patients.
get outhe finish line. It's gonna be close.
here they come!
all right, alright, all right! Come on, run!
come on! Come on! Come on, come on! Bring it in!
move! Move!- George?
3-way tie.
okay, final patient diagnosis.- Motion sickness!
no.- Dengue fever!
no!- Neurocysticercosis!
yay!- ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner.
nicely done.
Yes!
wait, what's the prize?
you get to scrub in on Shepherd's craniotomy...- yes!
and hold the doomsday sucker.
what's the doomsday sucker?
doomsday sucker?
it's just a really big sucker.- Yeah!
it was a hard surgery.
some of the bowel was dead, as we suspected, but we were able to remove the diseased part successfully.
he's in recovery, and you can see him in about an hour.
you don't even look like yourself.
excuse me?
you don't.
you look... hard.
and... look, I-I know it-- it wasn't easy over there.
I-I hear people come back and...
I know you can't just come back and be normal right away, - but-- he'll be asleep for a couple of hours, but you can see him now.
two lines in an e-il?
I deserve more than that.
Beth, your dad has colorectal cancer.
he's already been through radiation treatment and polyp removals.
he didn't tell you... 'cause he didn't want to burden you.
he'd like to spare you any pain...
any more pain.
he had all these friends.
they sang and they played guitar and...
it's almost like he was a totally different person.
well, he was.
it kind a freaks me out a little bit.
I feel like I don't know him.
and I don't know owen.
we don't. We don't know them.
hold up. Hold up. Hold up.
I just wanted to let you know, um, I'm happy to help you if you'd like
you know, reviewing the basics or putting in some supervised skills lab hours.
excuse me?
well, I... I was a repeater earlier this year. I know how easy it is to get behind.
I don't need a tutor.
you don't?- No.
at this point in your training, you should be able to hear symptoms, diagnose the problem and decide whether or not a patient needs surgery.
can you do that?
can you?
because think you can, and they will put you in situations where you have to.
Sadie, you could hurt someone.
I call her.
all right? I call my mother once a week.
I haven't told her that I'm back. She thinks that I'm calling from...
I keep the conversations short because I can't bear for her to know that the son she sent off to war is gone.
he's gone.
and if I just got in my car and drove the six miles to see her, she'd be so sad, and she would look at me the same way that beth does now...
like I'm not there.
the only time I don't feel like a ost is when you look at me because you look at me and you see me. You see me.
this is me. This is me.
please, Cristina, see me.
see me.
Jen, I am so sorry.
I have you scheduled for first thing tomorrow morning.
Derek... uh, I'm using your first name now...
because I like you a lot and I'm starting to consider us friends, - so I'm using your first name and I'm calling you derek.- Okay.
and, Derek, I'm begging you, please, please, please don't make me wait another night.
she's good. Try being married to her. You'll never say no again.
Dr. Grey.
it would appear that congratulations are in order.
thank you, dr. Sloan.
I'd also like it acknowledged that I offer these congratulations professionally and respectfully... without any innuendo or inappropriate body language.
acknowledged, Dr. Sloan.
doou know, what's a dooms day sucker?
mark, Addie, little Grey.- Little Grey?
I am gonna have to meet you at Joe's in a bit.
I have a craniotomy.
little Grey, I hear you're gonna be holding the doomsday sucker.
now? Great. Yeah, yeah, yes. Yes, sir.
O. R.Two. I'll see you there.- Okay.
doomsday sucker!
can you believe little Grey and, uh
Hey, did you hear derek was gonna propose to Meredith?
how about that?- And I'm off to surgery.
what?
Iz... what's going on with you?
nothing.
I'm fine.
you saw. The interns are not a bunch of losers.
they know things. They're gonna make good doctors.
really, I'm fine.
I'm fine.
she knows nothing.
just... nothing.
she's a danger to the patients, and so I told her that she could tell the chief or I could, and I wanted to let you know because you're her friend.
although for the life of me, I... I don't know how you two were ever friends.
what happened?
I quit.
O'malley's a little narc.
I'd rather be deemed a quitter than a cheater.
did you cheat your way into the program?
listen, I'm not book smart.
you know that.
I learn on my feet.
I thought if I came to where you were, you could...- pull you through.
we've seen each otherthrough a lot.
we're not 25, sleeping our way through europe anymore.
we could though.
think about it. We could get on a plane tonight.
we could go-- no, no.
I can't.
I have to work.
I can't just...
wow, you know...
they've sucked the life right out the meredith I used to know
is right here.
I'm here.
I just don't want to sleep my way through europe anymore.
I want to be here. I want to be here.
sucker at the ready?
sucker's at the ready.
you're mocking me.
only a little.
damn it. damn it.
what, what happened?
B. P.Ov 88 er 60. - Hang 2 units of blood.
okay, all joking aside, dr. Grey, bring in the doomsday sucker.
okay. Put it right in there. Right in here. Get in there.
Oh, my god.
okay. Microsutures, please.
B. P. I110 over 72.
okay, get the sucker out of there.
is that it? Did you--did you get it?
there's good flow.
Yes, we did it.
and that will teach me never to mock an eager young intern again.
I'm an ass.
you are such an ass.
I shouldn't have blurted.
a little warning would have been nice.
but you're okay?
you know, it's strange. I... I expected this horrible feeling, this wave of sadness or something to just take over, but... people get divorced... they meet new people, they remarry.
I don't know. You know, maybe it just.
seeing archer in that O. R.It just... 
changed my perspective or something.
but you sort of wished it'd been you first.
Oh, shut it.
so what, are you gonna ll derek about the-- okay, wait, wait.
if we call meredith the 12 year old, what--what do we call lexie, a preschooler?
she's a woman.
Oh, okay.- And I'm gonna tell him.
I'm working on it.
there he is!-oh, there you go.
that's the kind of welcome I deserve.
Joe, scotch for the neuro god.
you... you were a god today.
you were a god in that O. R.
you slew dragons, you walked on water.
you... you were a god, but now...
now you need to get very tiny again...
and go back in the box.
how--how was your craniotomy?
it was fine.- Yeah?
Yeah, and I stopped in on archer on my way out.
things are, uh, good.
good.
had his mitral valve gotten too thick?
Oh, god. Shut up.
is that what made the cadaver so sick?
but we can't-- wait, we can't remember the chorus. Come on.
Yeah, we got all the way through the second verse... no.
no.- Yes, yes.
your name starts the chorus. Your name-- yes, yes.
Addison montgomery- he met her in the summery it wasn't "summery.
I'd never use summery as a noun.
I met her... in the summer, she...- oh, summer, she--really?
Yeah.
summer, she," well.
that's clever.
she was... cutting up a very dead body this is why I don't stay in touch.
and in her eyes, I saw my life I knew that she would be my wife and she would breathe the life back into me ooh for every day until eternity or until I'd be as dead as that body - body - ah, jeez.
Yeah, you got it.
there you go. There you go.
Oh, help us. Cheers. Wonderful.
God.
what's happening?
you got some problems.
you've got some big problems.
I kissed a peds surgeon.
Calliope, this is Julie, my date.
I'm seeing Lexie.
Oh, my god! I think I broke it.
this is patient "X."
she's a 29-year-old female we misdiagnosed with anemia.
I'm applying for a fellowship in pediatric surgery.
which is not what we had discussed.
Where's my wife?
you killed her. You're a murderer.
every surgeon I know has a shadow...
a dark cloud of fear and doubt that follows even the best of us into the O. R.
dude, he is fried. -he's not fried.
he lost a patient and got hit with a lawsuit all in one week. He just needs time.
he's been sitting there for three days.
the sofa cushions are gonna start bonding to his ass, and he's eating all my cereal.
he's taking stock.
something huge and life-altering happened to him, and he's taking stock, figuring out his next move.
we shouldn't judge him. We shouldn't rush him.
whatever.
Sylvia Plath's picking out all the marshmallows.
they're the best part.
and I'm pretty sure that he's sitting on my keys.
I'd ask him to move, but he looks so... comfy.
Oh, you guys are cowards.
you're eating.
that's good. Appetite is good.
you know what else is good?
showering, cleansing, water.
are you thinking you'll shower, maybe go into the hospital?
I have to, for the deposition.
I have to go and explain in detail how I killed a man's pregnant wife.
that's good.
I mean, not the killing part, but the
I-I think you'll feel better once you...
go to...
work.
he'll be fine.
we pretend the shadow isn't there...
hoping that if we save more lives, master harder techniques, run faster and farther, it'll get tired and give up.
but like they say...
you can't outrun your shadow.
morning.
I dreamt once I was falling out a window hanging on to the drapes.
I woke up pulling Meredith's hair out.
so we have a trauma coming in.
a trampling on a football field.
no, I- I don't need your help.
Oh, but I'm on your service today.
and I'm telling you, Dr. Yang, I want you to take care of that elbow.
there you are. What happened to you?
I tripped and fell. It's fine.
no. No, it's not.
it's... it's nothing. It's--it was an accident.
what's wrong with you?
uh, Derek won't get off the couch.
so the weaker sex.
it's still swollen. I'd give it another day of rest.
I haven't operated in three days.
don't hit people with your scalpel hand.
have you talked to him yet?
he threw the first punch.
well, you did catch him at a bad time.
so he lost a patient. Boo-hoo.
we're surgeons. We're men. We lose patients.
it doesn't give him the right to go around behaving like a drunk frat boy.
and now I'm supposed to go crawling back begging for his forgiveness?
what, uh-- what are you doing?
I went all "say anything" on the peds surgeon in front of the peds surgeon's date, -so now I am hiding from the peds surgeon. -Mature.
um, you got in a fistfight. No judging.
hand! -Hand!
Oh, god. I'm sorry. I... I forgot.
I--I'm so sorry.
I feel terrible about everything, about the fight and your hand and Derek and...
you know, he's not doing so well. I really think that you should talk to him.
I should talk to him?
look at you-- your stethoscope around your neck, charting...
I can totally see you in ten years, a little salt and pepper in your hair, big-shot attending.
you're gonna be a rock star, Alex.
what is this?
what, I can't fantasize about my boyfriend and his bright, bright future?
shut up.
Dr. Stevens, we've been working on the patient "x" case, and we have a couple of ideas.
great, let's get to work.
what's this patient "x" thing that's taking all the interns?
and when's it gonna be over?
I need minions to do my crap work.
some new teaching thing.
you know, we're all killing ourselves to get into the O. R.
when's the last time Izzie held a scalpel?
she's falling behind.
she's like the new O' Malley.
Izzie's nothing like O' Malley. -Hello.
okay, O' Malley, you're in the clinic.
grey and yang, you're with me.
Karev, you're in the pit with Hunt.
Oh, no, Dr. Bailey, I'm supposed to be on trauma today.
save it, Yang. Hunt wants karev.
Oh! Sir, there you are.
shepherd planning to grace us with his presence today?
Yes. He's fine.
sir, I--I've been trying to page you all morning.
I could use your help on a case if you're available.
no peds today?
um, no.
must be slumming. -Excuse me?
Tricia Shelley, 31, Megan Shelley, 27, Michael Shelley, 23, genetic testing revealed they all carry the CDH1 gene for hereditary diffuse gastric cancer.
which means at, dr. Grey?
which means they all have a 3-in-4 chance of developing the cancer.
Dr. Bailey has taken tumors out of pretty much everyone on our mother's side.
unfortunately, it's a highly aggressive cancer.
the tumors grow quickly, so by the time I get in there
our family tree is down to a branch.
how is uncle Bud doing? -Dead.
and aunt Helen? -Dead.
what about the Minnesota cousin? -Not dead.
she's 90 pounds and in hospice, Meg. Still, not dead yet.
so, uh, you've... decided you're ready to take the next step.
we've made a pact. We're all in this together.
cut our stomachs out, Dr. Bailey.
Beth Dearborn, 17 year old with a history of seizures
had a grand mal during a marching band performance.
started seizing again upon arrival.
push 2 of lorazepam.
she's in v-fib. Ventilate and charge the paddles to 200.
wait. The v-fib could be just artifact from the seizure.
if we shock her and she's not actually in v-fib, she'll flatline.
you got a pulse? - I- I think so. I don't know.
it's hard to tell.
Lorazepam's not working. Damn it.
what do we do?
we shock her and save her, or shock her and kill her.
what the hell...
clear.
clear!
sinus tach. -Good call, Dr. Hunt.
Ah, it was a 50-50 shot.
Oh, no. It happened again?
Beth, I'm Dr. Robbins, the pediatric surgeon on call. This is Dr. Hunt.
you got beat up pretty bad while you were marching.
we're gonna run some tests, check for internal injuries.
I seized during the performance?
but I took my meds.
relax. It's not like you crapped your pants or anything.
it is like I crapped my pants.
I had a seizure in front of the entire marching band.
it is exactly like I crapped my pants.
they're gonna kill me.
who? -Seizure patrol.
you're the seizure patrol?
I'm first chair Clarinet. He's drum major.
whenever Beth has a seizure, we have to drop our instruments and go roll her on her side so she doesn't choke on her tongue.
we were in the middle of the northwest regnal parade.
we were favored to win.
Yeah, until Beth took down the snare drum, half of the woodwinds.
the tubas tried to avoid her, but she was right in the middle of formation.
Ah, okay. Uh, why don't you just go call her parents?
I'm gonna run some tests, but she's already coded once, so I want you to watch her and standby with a crash cart.
you want me to sit here and babysit the band nerd?
that's an intern job.
I don't see any interns around.
Dr. Grey.
patient "x," a previously healthy 29-year-old female presented with stable vital signs, a normal physical exam, uh, with symptoms of occasional right upper quadrant pain, nausea and hallucinations.
head C. T. , Chest x-ray, C.B.C. were normal, but chemistries revealed an elevated L.D.H.
so you are this girl's doctor.
she comes to you, she's scared, she doesn't know what's wrong.
you have to diagnose her.
what do you do next?
what test do you run?
how about a retic count or peripheral smear?
you'd be wasting your time. The C.B.C. was normal, remember?
you said there was abdominal pain. What about an upper G.I.?
good.
that is exactly what patient x's doctor did next.
what does this tell us?
what is all this?
possible side effects and complications from prophylactic gastrectomy, so post-op, you know what to expect.
malnourishment, weakness, fatigue...dumping syndrome?
Oh, that doesn't sound good.
possible anal leakage?
a gastrectomy isn't like getting your appendix out.
we're changing the way your entire digestive system works.
this is a serious adjustment.
I'm the president of my frat.
I have a girlfriend. I go snowboarding.
how am I supposed to do all that stuff when I'm suddenly this weak old man with anal leakage?
you know how important this is to Trish.
Trish has run our lives since we were little kids.
she decides where we go to dinner, where we go on vacation, where we do thanksgiving.
I'm 23 years old. If I don't want to butcher myself, she can't make me.
so you'd rather die like mom or grandpa or uncle Bud?
and it's not quick, Mike. It's a slow, painful way to go.
there's a 1-in-4 shot we don't get it, right?
that's something! -Don't be stupid.
you are doing this, and we discussed it.
you're not in charge of me anymore!
I didn't realize it was such a big deal.
I just... I just need a little time to think about it, okay?
no, no, no.
Callahan on the bypass. Levin on the appy.
damn craniotomy... where the hell is shepherd?!
uh, you can't rely on shepherd, sir. Is there anything I can do for you?
well, my neurosurgeon's been missing for days, I still have no head of cardio,
I've got general surgeons quitting on me left and right,
I've got surgeries piling up like dead fish and no surgeons to do 'em.
well, then now would probably be a bad time to tell you that my hand's still out of commission, and I can't operate.
you know what? Leave me on the board, chief. I won't let you down.
I could do that craniotomy, chief.
put Dr. Nelson on the craniotomy.
appreciate it, John. -It's--it's Jim.
you must be new. Welcome to Seattle Grace.
I've been here ten years.
I was the interim chief of neuro before shepherd and his red cape swooped in from New York.
mark Sloan, plastics.
we've met... three times.
I don't know why Mr. Bimm ever let her even join band.
not like she's a master flautist. -Okay, get out.
Mr. Bimm says we're supposed to stay with her till her...
I got it. I'm seizure patrol now.
your friends are asses.
they're not my friends.
once you spaz out in front of the whole school, friends are kinda hard to come by.
I know you can't help the epilepsy, but nobody made you join the marching band.
that's like spreading nerd on nerd.
I like being in the band, okay?
it's, like, the one thing I'm actually good at.
What'd you do in high school?
I wrestled. -You' a wrestler?
you wearing tights under that lab coat?
it was a long time ago that was in high school. I'm a surgeon now.
fine. Then how would you feel if you seized every time you went into the operating room?
Yeah, okay.
you realize, that as your doctor, I'm not recommending this, right?
I need to get through my surgeries today.
Oh, you're gonna get through them, you're just gonna be in a world of hurt later.
you heard of a Dr. Nelson in neuro?
Oh, yeah.
shadow shepherd. -Shadow shepherd?
Yeah. He's a solid surgeon, but sort of the J. V. Player to shepherd's varsity, the, uh, b-team, to shepherd's "a," the--the bricklayer to shepherd's architect.
I get it.
just 'cause the guy doesn't publish fancy clinical trials or take on flashy surgery or have creepy, perfect hair, he's less of a man?
kinda.
how'd it go with the lawyers?
they told me my death rate.
these are the people I saved.
these are the people I killed.
okay, well, most of those people were terminal when they came to you.
you were their last chance.
and you take on impossible cases.
look at the clinical trial.
so many people... more than Dahmer, Manson, Bundy combined.
you're not looking at the big picture.
this is the big picture.
Oh, shepherd. Thank god you're back.
can you swing two brain biopsies today?
I'm not operating, Richard.
look, I know you've got a big lawsuit breathing down your neck, and I know you lost a patient, but I need you back to work doing the job I hired you to do.
I'm not operating.
I am not asking, I'm telling, as chief surgeon of this hospital, if you don't get back to that O. R. today, shepherd...
and he just walked out. Without saying a word, he just walked out.
hunt won't even look at me since he went all "apocalypse now" on me this morning.
had to get all scalpels happy up in that patient's brain, and now he can't face it.
he thinks I'm, what, like this wilting flower?
well, guess what. I'm the strong one.
Oh, my god. I'm the strong one.
and you see, if I had that stomach cancer gene, I would get that gastrectomy, no problem.
I face things. I don't walk away.
Derek walks away. Maybe walking away is the answer.
see, it's not emotional. It's science.
you have a problem, don't ignore it.
well, sometimes if you have to pee and you ignore it, it does go away.
you guys are hilarious.
I mean, do you even know what she just said?
or what she just said?
I can totally see you guys in 50 years in a nursing home, just talking at each other with your hearing aids off.
Hi-larious!
Oh, I love lunch.
what the hell?
code blue!
after I take out the stomach, I'll do what, Yang?
sew the esophageal anastomosis.
or the other option is, Grey?
you could staple the anastomosis.
now why would I want to do that?
fistula rates can be higher when you hand sew.
you might say that using the old stapler is sort of my specialty.
I thought your specialty was babysitting children.
uh... I'm sure you'd rather be doing that right now.
frankly, sir, I feel like I am.
excuse me, sir. I think you should feel this.
right here.
tell me that's not what I think it is.
wait, wait. I think I got it.
liver enzymes are normal, cardiac workup is negative
if L.D.H. is a false positive-- it's a trick question.
what? -She's fine. Patient "x" is fine.
she's not fine.
okay, well, her sed rate is slightly elevated. Did we check for autoimmune disease?
Yeah, A.N.A. and C.R.P. were negative, too.
at worst, she's got an anxiety disorder.
the girl is totally fine.
she is... she is not fine!
she had hallucinations.
she had visual, auditory and tactile hallucinations about her dead fianc?
she thought she could talk to him and touch him.
she's not fine.
she's not fine.
you're missing something.
you're not looking in the right place.
go back and figure out what you are missing.
she has it? Trish has cancer?
well, the cancer was stage I, since we got to it so early, the gastrectomy was probably curative.
she just had her endoscopy a few months ago.
it was an aggressive cancer that grew quickly.
the fact that we took out her stomach today-- it saved your sister's life.
the reason Trish decides everything-- thanksgiving, dinners, vacations.
she's the only one left who knows how to cook a turkey, Mike.
she's the only one left who likes planning vacations.
and she's the only one left who ever remembers to make dinner reservations.
she's in cage of us because everyone else is dead.
I want it, now.
I want the surgery right now.
why is she coding when she seizes? It doesn't make any sense.
not in a girl this young. Her heart should be fine.
Beth coded before her seizure, not during it.
I saw her heart go into v-fib.
she's 17 with no heart history, Karev.
Yeah, I know, but I saw it on the monitor.
you think you saw it on the monitor.
seizures are chaotic. Doctors panic in the moment.
I didn't panic. I know what I saw.
are you suggesting that I tell that girl and her parents that she's been wrongly treated for epilepsy for six years?
and then I think we should do a cardiac workup with an E. P. study.
you want me to deliberately shock a perfectly healthy child's heart?
absolutely not.
Dr. Hunt.
if he's right, it would explain the coding.
if he's wrong, it will kill her.
look, I'm not wrong!
then it's your call, Karev.
maybe Cristina's right.
maybe trying to teach the interns is pointless.
please. Don't listen to Cristina.
she thinks just because you'd rather teach than take out a gall bladder, that you're the new me.
O'malley, the sequel. -O'Malley 2. 0.
you read more journals and do more research and log more hours in the skills lab than any other resident here.
you never give up on trying to be a better doctor, and you don't step on other people to do it.
I would be lucky to be the new you.
are you gonna tell me about patient "x"?
I know what we missed. -Gotta go, George.
okay, she had enlarged lymph nodes, right? But it's not mono.
so what if we missed a malignancy in her brain?
well, you already ruled that out with a C. T. -I think that was a mistake.
I'd like to order an M.R.I. with contrast, maybe biopsy a lymph node.
whatever's wrong with patient "x," it's already in her brain, isn't it?
Yeah.
clamp's going in.
I don't feel any masses.
2-0 vicryl, please.
uh, sir, if I may, one more time, I think stapling would be a better choice.
if I'm not mistaken, Dr. Bailey, you no longer wish to be a general surgeon in this hospital.
so why don't we leave the technical calls up to me?
I was simply expressing my opinion on what would be best for my patient.
okay, you don't get an opinion here!
this is my patient because this is my hospital.
when it's your hospital, you can make the damn decisions.
but until then, this is my hospital!
and I want all of you people to do what I say!
Yes, sir. 2-0 vicryl, please.
you're gonna be okay.
you're in really good hands.
I'm gonna ask you one more time, Karev...
are you sure about this?
Yeah.
then you're on crash cart.
if you're wrong... be ready tuse it.
your path report came back clear.
there are no cancerous cells in your stomach.
how's your pain?
uh, the wound hurts a little.
not too bad, right? -Yeah.
don't you remember how much pain mom was in at the end? -No.
you used to help me wet her lips with an ice cube.
it was awful.
she couldn't even drink.
she had so many tubes everywhere.
I don't remember.
I was 2 years old when mom died.
the only reason I know it was sad and horrible is because you tell me all the time.
I don't have nightmares about funerals.
I don't freak out and think it's cancer every time I have indigestion.
you.
mike-- this is your fear.
it's not mine.
so just... let me decide when I'm scared.
let's take the pace up to 300.
vitals are still stable.
this is pointless. The study is showing no sign of arrhythmia.
wait. V-tach. She's in v-tach.
all right, let's just pace her out of it. -Take it to 3-3-0.
B.P.'s down, 60 over 10. -340. Damn it.
she's not breaking. Karev, get in there now.
wait, hold the shock.
she's coming out.
this could be A. R. V. C.
the right ventricle's causing the arrhythmia.
her brain doesn't get oxygen-- and then she seizes.
Oh, my god.
Karev, you just saved this girl's life.
it's okay. It's okay. Just... just breathe.
put the paddles down and breathe.
it's okay.
it's okay.
well, it wasn't easy.
not only did I push through my harelip reconstruction and a tympanoplasty, but I pulled out a burn graft so beautiful it could bring a grown man to tears.
chief?
you haven't heard from shepherd, have you?
no, sir. I haven't.
sir.
okay, I have tried to let it go, because I know it's not personal.
I understand it's very hard for you.
I understand you're under a great deal of pressure.
but the way you yelled at me in the O. R.
today, in front of my residents?
not okay, sir. Not okay at all.
now... you and me, we're just gonna have to find a way to work together.
so you... not talking to me now?
well, that's... just real mature, sir.
that's real mature.
we have a diagnosis.
go ahead, Dr. Grey.
patient "x"--an elevated L. D. H. was our only clue.
uh, and then we found out that she had enlarged lymph nodes and a suspicious mole, which was biopsied.
meanwhile, this M. R. I. with contrast showed a met on her right temporal lobe, and the biopsy revealed dividing cells.
that coupled with further staging tests led to our final diagnosis of metastatic melanoma with mets to the liver, skin and brain.
your prognosis?
with chemo and radiation, uh, a few months.
at best. Girl's pretty much toast.
survival rate's 5%.
if I were her, I'd go on a really good vacation.
or go to church, ask for forgiveness, prayers.
good job, everybody.
that's it?
after the last contest, we got a prize.
Yeah, what's our prize?
you think every time you diagnosis a patient, hand down one a death sentence, there's a prize?
the prize is... you didn't screw it up this time.
the prize is you people actually did something right.
the prize is you were doctors today.
you were doctors.
Adele? What are you doing here?
conference room, Richard. Now.
you, too, Miranda. Let's go.
it's a pacemaker.
it's going to regulate your abnormal arrhythmias so you won't have any more seizures.
so... I'm not sick anymore.
a wrestler fixed me.
not exactly. You still have a serious heart condition.
so we're gonna set you up with a cardiologist.
but no one has to know.
I won't be frothing at the mouth.
I don't have to wear a bracelet to school.
I can cover this with a shirt.
Yeah. That's something, huh?
it's everything.
once people see you as sick, they don't see anything else.
Mr. Bimm just called.
we didn't get a trophy.
there's always next season, right?
Yeah, we were thinking maybe you should try out for choir or debate.
something requiring less movement. -Yeah.
we're just worried for your safety.
you don't have to be. We fixed her.
epileptic bone. -What?
There--there's no such thing as an epileptic bone.
are you a doctor?
so she's... like, totally normal now?
dude, none of you are normal.
you're freakin' band nerds.
of all the petty, ridiculous, infantile-- are you running a hospital here or a playground?
Adele, I will not be spoken to in that-- hospital or playground, Richard?!
hospital.
then start acting like the chief of a hospital and apologize to that woman, right now.
sorry. -You call that an apology?
now you better not leave this room until the two of you work this out, because if I have to drag myself down here through rush-hour traffic again to police this damn jungle gym.
Adele, you've made your point.
and you wipe that smile off your face.
you're no better-- tattling on a man to his wife.
when you have your stomach out, you can't eat sugar anymore.
if he's doing this because he doesn't want to give up his damn jelly beans...
I think it's more than that.
or football or girls or snowboarding or whatever the hell it is.
it doesn't matter, not compared to the alternative.
well, we'll be as vigilant as we can.
we'll use every screening tool available.
that won't be necessary. Mikey's gonna have the surgery.
maybe not today, but I'm gonna be on him like glue to my dying breath until he does.
and if he just wants to be left alone?
you don't leave the people you love alone, Dr. Grey.
that idiot may noknow it yet, but my fear is what's gonna save his life.
I learned a lot today-- diagnosing a patient from beginning to end.
so... thank you for teaching us.
what would you say?
to patient "x"-- how would you-- how would you break the news?
um... I would say that I was very sorry and--and that there were support groups that...
I don't--I don't know.
What--what do you say to somebody who's--who's gonna...
you say... they have choice.
they can run away and hide from it, or they can face it.
you say they need to be around the people who love them because it's gonna be the toughest fight of their life and no one should have to do it alone.
and then you give them the odds.
and even though a 5% survival rate is bad, it's really bad, you say...
you say...
screw the odds.
people die of the hiccups.
my mother died of the hiccups.
and survival rate for that is what, 100%?
the odds are that she should be alive right now.
the odds are that the--the odds mean crap.
so people should face it, and they should fight.
maybe not those words.
no.
exactly those words.
thank you, Dr. Grey.
how's she doing?
uh, she's, uh, she's stable.
you did a hell of a job today, and the chief is gonna hear about it.
pretty impressive for a resident.
you fix that attitude of yours, you could be the future of this hospital, the one to watch.
you go, Karev.
hunt's letting me do the distal anastomosis on his fem-pop.
that's awesome. -It's crazy.
they just told me I could be the future of this hospital, that I'm the resident to watch.
and that's... I mean... I'm not the kinda guy who-- like, I don't rise, okay?
I sink to the bottom.
and now I'm getting all this-- this respect, and you...
you--you gotta stop wasting all your time with this patient "x" crap.
Alex-- I know you like teaching, and that's great, but you need to start treating real patients with real surgeries, because once they see you as weak, it's over.
and, Iz, you could be a great surgeon.
we could be great together.
you just--you gotta stop screwing round, because I don't want to be the future of this hospital if you're not there with me, okay?
okay.
Alex! -What?
you told Adele on me?
you stopped speaking to me, sir. That didn't exactly leave me many options.
I'd like to know, would you have reacted like this if I had left general surgery for neuro or cardio?
I don't follow.
or is it because you regard peds as a FT specialty?
is that what's bothering you? -Oh, that's ridiculous.
well, maybe, but it seems to me that every time I do something that you perceive as soft, like having a baby, taking some time off to see my baby, specializing in babies, I'm dead to you.
you want to know what I think, sir? -Not particularly.
I think you're scared that you've gone soft.
you blame this whole hospital's decline on it, and you want to know what I think about that?
you're gonna tell me anyway.
it's not doing you one bit of good.
I mean, surgeons are still dropping like dominoes around here.
so maybe it's time that you got in touch with your feminine side.
maybe you need a little soft.
you still shouldn't have ratted me out.
sorry.
me, too.
wh-what are you doing?
assigning myself to trauma with you tomorrow you know, I'm a big girl.
I can handle my share of trauma.
and I get to decide when I've had enough.
it's gonna take a lot more than a bad dream to scare me off.
it's more than a bad dream.
I know.
look, I know... I have no business asking you for anything.
but I need your help.
I need you to bring Derek back.
and he's not fine.
sometimes people just want to be left alone.
he's planning to propose.
he's been carrying around a big ring for weeks.
that's not a man who wants to be left alone.
I just thought you should know.
Yes, the odds are against us, I'm a one-woman wrecking ball.
all I do is break you-- your hand, your penis, your relationships, your life.
I'd say our survival rate is about 3%, and that's--that's-- that's bad.
but it's not nothing, and--and I don't think that we should give up on this, at least not yet, because
okay.
you think you broke me, Grey?
you're the one who put me back together.
hand. -Hand.
uh, Mark.
I've got a couple of shepherd's post-ops to check in on, but after that, you feel like a drink?
how 'bout a rain check, John?
it's Jim.
so... I've had quite a day.
got my ass handed to me by Alex Karev, a second-year resident, which is humbling for a surgeon, -especially a know-it-all, type-a-- we don't have to do this.
we don't have to be friends.
it's a big hospital with lots of floors, lots of places to hide, and I'm perfectly okay with doing that for the next few years.
you're not hearing me, Calliope.
sometimes I panic in the moment, and I call it wrong.
I misjudge a situation.
so if you're up for it, I'd like to take you to dinner.
maybe.
maybe?
Yeah, my schedule's kind of insane right now.
so I'll, uh, get back to you.
how's, uh, tomorrow?
good night, Iz. -Night.
um... I've been keeping my distance 'cause you're with Alex, but I just want to let you know, I'm still here, I still care.
Thanks, George.
and you don't want to talk about it?
not yet.
okay. Good night. -Night.
you don't like me very much, do you?
uh-- no, it's good.
it's good, because I need to tell you something.
I need to tell you because I need to tell somebody, and... and you're a robot.
you can take it.
okay.
I can't tell you here.
I-I can't. -Okay.
I can't. -Okay.
okay.
you cleaned all of your clothes out of the closet at the house.
go home, Mer. Just go home.
well, how long are you planning on hiding out here?
because that's what you're doing. You're hiding.
you made a mistake.
she's dead, and you can't hide from that.
I'm not hiding.
I'm done. I'm done operating.
Oh, okay. So you're just quitting?
you should understand better than anybody else.
you wrote the book on quitting, running, hiding.
you've written a lot of books, Meredith.
that may be true, but I'm here now.
you're here now?
you' wanted me out since the day I moved in.
that is not true.
because you're incapable of anything that resembles commitment.
you lied to me.
you said you were healthy, that you... you were healed.
there's no fixing you.
you're a lemon.
Derek Shepherd, you are drunk.
and you're angry.
and I've been there, so I get it.
but that does not give you the right-- just go home, Meredith.
you don't get to just stand here and tell me
this is what you want. I'm giving you an out.
go. -I'm not going anywhere.
I said leave! Meredith, leave!
I know there's a ring.
what?
the chief told me. I know there's a ring.
you want the ring?
here's your ring.
every surgeon has a shadow...
is that the best you've got?
cause I'm not bailing. We're in this together.
go home, Meredith!
and the only way to get rid of a shadow...
is to turn off the lights...
to stop running from the darkness...
and face what you fear...
head-on.
chicken.
good chicken.
Yeah, chicken.
I know it's chicken. I want to know what it tastes like.
it tastes like chicken.
I'm having surgery today. - Maybe if the mets have shrunk.
I am maybe having surgery today,
and as such, I cannot taste the chicken for myself,
I really need you guys to tell me what it tastes like.
I need to nail down this dinner.
so I can announce on Meredith and Derek's wedding web site.
there is a web site?
so can you please a little more articulate and just chicken?
that's the one. - You are very dapper Dr. Shepherd?
you're serious about this. It's not some cool joke.
you look fantastic. He looks fantastic, right?
Yeah. - Whatever.
remember when we were little.
and we would accidently bite a kid on playground?
good luck with your scan. - Good chicken.
so?
pork.
our teachers would go, "say you're sorry."
fine. I'll taste the chicken.
and we would say it, but we wouldn't mean it.
because the stupid kid we bit totally deserved it.
Oh! Oh. Sorry. I'm sorry.
take care now.
Hey. So... I can't afford rent.
Owen just told me to "take care now." - Nice. Its three words.
Yeah, it's more than she's getting from any of her family.
my mom-- silent. My aunt-- silent.
my sister Aria-- I know.
I know how much power my father wields,
but seriously, I mean, what am I,
invisible, dead to them, to my mother?
well, you just have to give them some more time.
I mean, why can't you just tell them you guys broke up?
it's no one's business who you go out with anyway, right?
and I will leave you to ponder that.
but as we get older, making amends...
isn't so simple.
you really think I should lie?
I really think you should pay rent.
but, you know, whatever. Take care now.
after the playground days are over, you can't just say it.
you have to mean it.
I got you a present.
I told you, you can't give me money,
even if you are a fancy plastic surgeon.
I am not your charity case. I-I am not your mistress.
I'm your friend, your equal, so... - It's not money.
Oh, really?
cause I was just doing the "poor but proud" thing for show.
before I accepted your government cheese.
it's better than money. Wait.
of course, when you become a doctor, "sorry" is not a happy word.
it either means, "you're dying, and I can't help."
she fell out of a tree and broke all her limbs.
Ooh. That is better.
or it means, "this is really gonna hurt."
how many days? - 29.
fresh from rehab.
I could tell you some good meetings in the area.
Thanks. They-- they gave me a whole list.
so that's one more thing we have in common.
have you... talked to Meredith...
to Lexie?
okay, Willow, I'm afraid your cheekbone looks broken, too.
I'll need to wait a few weeks until the swelling goes down to repair that.
in a few weeks, I'm gonna be up a tree in Utah.
those corporate bastards, the same ones who just bulldozed me out of Kaili.
they want to clear-cut acres to build another ski condo complex.
sons of bitches!
there is so much about that sentence I do not understand.
uh, you were bulldozed out of something?
uh, uh, Kaili.
she was the tree that I was living in for the past six weeks.
she was a beautiful 200-year-old oak.
in a grove full of beautiful 200-year-old oaks.
you named a tree "Kaili"?
kaili is Hawaiian, for "divine beauty and wisdom."
and she was all of those things.
she was all of those things, and now she's gone.
they're all gone.
and for what, Yuppie housing?
those corporate bastards!
I'm really sorry,
but you're not gonna be climbing up any trees for a good long while.
how does one exactly live in a tree?
I mean, how exactly does one say, eliminate waste?
he's, um, asking where your poo goes,
which may not be the most sensitive question.
while she's mourning the death of her...
tree friend.
excuse me, doctor.
Oh, excuse me, young-and-yummy doctor.
can I help you? - I don't know. Can you?
are you looking for someone, ma'am?
Oh, gosh. I'm gonna pretend that you didn't just call me "ma'am,"
because I have this image of you and me in my head playing doctor,
and that just kinda ruined it.
okay, I'm gonna go back to work now, but good luck with, whatever.
well, I am looking for a doctor.
gosh, I guess she's a patient now.
um, Isobel Stevens.
I'm, uh...
I'm an old friend.
after you.
Oh, a doctor and a gentleman. Now that's a double yummy.
my god! Who's getting married?! - Oh, my god. Mom.
what are you doing here?
mom? - Now shush, cricket.
you don't want that hot doctor to think I'm old.
Hey. You got paged, too?
Yeah. Report to the chief's office, stat.
what do-- what do you think? Why?
why-- why would he page us stat? - I don't know.
did we kill anyone lately and don't remember?
your father's here.
he's 29 days sober, just out of rehab.
he's taking it seriously. He's working his steps.
the ninth step is to make amends wherever possible.
it's the key to an alcoholic's recovery.
to take responsibility for the wreckage of his past.
I paged you here to ask you to please hear him out.
as a favor to me-- to please hear him out.
uh, I'm covering the pit, chief, and-- - I'll cover it.
but there's a trauma coming in. - I got it, Meredith.
please.
please.
Hey, what are you doing here?
the chief specifically asked me to cover Mer in the pit.
I'm on Hunt's service all month.
o' Malley. Hey there now. Uh, O'Malley, update me.
uh, two ambulances.
three patients, one critical.
multiple gunshot wounds.
Mike Carlson, 35, multiple g. s.w. s.
last b. p.--88 systolic after 2 boluses of l. R.
where was he shot? - Chest, abdomen, back, legs, shoulder.
someone meant business. - I'm not so sure about that.
she didn't mean it. It was an accident.
she really didn't mean it. She's sorry.
Maddy, tell 'em you're sorry. - She's the shooter?
somebody page the chief.
breath sounds are better.
he's got three to the thoracoabdominal area.
what does that bring the count up to?
these three places, plus seven to the legs.
that's ten-- no, actually, there's two on the side here.
could be through and through. Put a swab through and see where it goes.
should we roll him now? - Finish his catheter.
does it enter and exit?
hold on. That makes 11.
what can we infer from these injuries?
there's blood in the urine, so I'm guessing kidney.
okay, O' Malley, let's roll him on your count.
Oh, yeah. There are more wounds back here.
yang, page Shepherd.
let's make sure we get an accurate count while we have him positioned.
Maddy, how's this feel?
does it hurt when I do this?
good. Now what about this cut?
can you tell me how you got this big cut on your face?
she's scared.
she's scared she did a bad thing and you're gonna take her away from me.
the police will want to talk to both of you about how Maddy got the gun.
we called social services, and they'll be here soon.
and they'll give you all the support that you need to come back from this.
and nobody is gonna take you away from your mom.
okay, Maddy? You hear me?
it hit her in the face-- the gun, the kickback.
cause this doesn't look like... - That's how she got the cut.
her daddy shoots targets in the backyard.
he put the gun down for a minute.
it was stupid. It was really stupid.
she never meant to hurt him.
okay, you'll tell the police that, and it'll be okay.
everything will be okay.
I'm so deeply sorry...
for every time that I ever hurt you.
or disappointed you or let you down.
I don't deserve your forgiveness.
but I hope-- I so hope that you'll give me the opportunity to earn it.
thank you.
congratulations on... you seem well.
good luck.
and then you remember Jade from 114? Well...
she had a spot of cancer last year. It was breast cancer.
that was such a shame, I thought, 'cause she had such a great rack.
God, do you remember what a great rack she had?
you used to do all those little exercises like this.
to try to get yours to grow like hers.
anyway, my point is, Jade, she had 'em cut off-- both of 'em,
just to be on the safe side, and they look even better now.
no, for real. Life gave her lemons and she made cantaloupes.
so maybe, I don't know, maybe, honey,
um, mom, just, uh, just listen, okay?
I... I don't have breast cancer.
okay, I have skin cancer, or what started out as skin cancer.
wait, hang on. Skin cancer?
Oh, god! Isobel Stevens.
Oh, you scared the hell out of me.
and then you made me come all the way up here to Seattle.
just for some ugly old mole?
Oh, sweetie. - No, I didn't.
I didn't make you come up here. I didn't even call you.
I'm really--I'm curious. Who did?
who called?
who called her?
seriously, who called her?
you okay? Are you crying?
my dad's here. - Okay.
he's here and he's sober,
and I would really like for you to meet him.
how about dinner, tonight? Camparo's at 8: 00?
Lexie, uh...
dads historically do not love me.
and by that I mean that when I was a-a teenager.
dads did-- did not love me.
and... and that's the last time I had to meet anyone's dad.
I'm crazy about you.
and-- and I know that my dad would be, too.
you have nothing to worry about.
that's what you said when you told me to tell Derek.
Lexie, I'm closer to your dad's age than yours.
so I'm thinking he-- he may not... love me so much.
you know, what we have is fantastic.
why don't we just... keep it for us?
excuse me. I'm looking for my sister--Karen Zelmann.
well, I have a Willow Zelmann in--in there.
her name is Karen. - My name is Willow!
I told you.
I told you this would happen.
I told you to come down out of the damn tree, Karen.
uh, how'd it go?
Dr. Grey, if you're free, Maddy here could use a little cleaning and laceration repair 'cause I'm being paged.
Absolutely.
Meredith.
are you okay? - I'm great.
Thanks.
Hey, Maddy. I'm Dr. Grey.
you mind if I take a look at that cut on your face?
you know, she's so sorry. She's so sorry.
is my daddy gonna die?
I don't know. I hope not.
five bullets still inside.
how many gunshots total?
there are 25 wounds total. 5 are lodged inside.
two graze wounds, nine through and through so 17 bullets.
17?
I thought this was an accidental shooting.
how come?
how come what?
how come he doesn't die? I shot him lots of times.
how come he doesn't die?
she's just a little girl, a baby.
she wasn't really trying to kill him. She was...
she doesn't even understand what that means.
she was just trying to stop him. She was only trying to stop him.
so that cut on her face didn't come from the gun?
he was hitting her.
he loves us.
daddy loves us, Maddy. And sometimes he just gets mad.
and he's been working on it.
he's been working on it so hard.
but she was just trying to stop him.
she wasn't trying to kill him.
she wasn't really trying to kill him.
please understand.
she was just a little girl.
Oh, really?
Uh-huh. Really?
Oh, yeah, that's great. That's great.
Oh, thank you. Yes, thank you, honey.
thanks a million. Oh.
Oh, that's great news, Cricket.
you're gonna be just fine.
Oh, yeah?
let me guess. Your psychic told you that?
it's not just any old psychic.
he's the best that I've ever heard of.
anyway, he said that skin cancer
is highly curable if caught early.
Oh, that's so great.
a psychic with internet access.
let me guess how much that calls cost you, mother.
$19. 99 a minute?
well, when you have a sick child, Cricket,
money's not really the first thing on your mind.
you seem like a very capable doctor, Dr. Bailey.
can I trust that you caught my daughter's skin cancer early?
um... well, uh, Mrs. Stevens.
Oh, no. Call me Robbie, honey.
no, mom. Don't call her honey.
don't call bailey honey.
you know, if you have questions you can just ask me.
she's very busy, and this thing I have,
it's complicated, so...
I know it's complicated, Isobel I'm not a complete idiot.
now I saw this thing on Tyra's show.
there was this woman who had a mole on her private parts.
and the dermatologist did not bother to check her privates 'cause she thought that the gynaecology would do it. Maybe the gynaecology...
didn't do it. Maybe she didn't even go to the gynaecology. I don't know.
anyway, it was bad. She was bald and everything.
she did not have a mole on her private parts, did she?
no, ma'am. No, she did not.
good.
we need to take him in now g. s. w. s. to the abdomen,
hematuria, vital signs are unstable.
ma'am, he has major internal injuries.
we're rushing him to surgery now.
wait!
Maddy needs to tell her daddy she's sorry before he goes.
baby, you need to tell your daddy you're sorry.
Maddy, people die in surgery.
you don't want your daddy to die.
without telling him how sorry you are.
come on. Let's go tell him we love him.
you know, no. - No. What?
Maddy, stay right here, okay? - Dr. Grey.
no, she will not go apologize to him.
you should be apologizing to her.
I understand you're a victim here,
there is no room for you to be a victim when your 6 year old is on the line.
she's stronger than you. Your 6 year old is stronger than you at least she did something.
she stood up for the two of you,
which is more than you did for her.
no, she won't apologize to him.
thank you so much. All right. I'll call you back.
listen, I have great news. I have an associate
who has a contact at Schuster and Werner.
more like dirtbag and felon.
they've agreed to pay the medical bills.
and to not sue you for trespassing.
if you sign a contract saying you won't sue them.
and you won't trespass on any of their property ever again.
do you know how many acres of forest they have single-handedly destroyed,
how many ecosystems will never be restored?
the bees are dying, Julie.
the temperature is rising. - I'm sorry.
is it possible I could have a moment alone with my sister?
you will sign this deal, Karen.
my name is Willow!
I can't say I'm sorry I never had siblings.
they're yelling 'cause they care. - That how it works?
Yeah, it is. In some families, it is.
I expected them to yell, you know?
I didn't expect silence.
why don't you call 'em and claim temporary insanity?
you don't have to end it with roller girl.
just say you did. - Yang said the same thing.
that's because it's none of their business.
there's no reason you should have to hurt this much.
I can see that you're...
angry with me.
and maybe angry with your mother, but-- - Don't do that.
I'm not your friend and I am not your family.
you don't get to call me into your office on personal business,
and you don't get to speak to me this way right now.
it's an abuse of power.
I'm a resident. I work for you.
you have to speak to me like I'm a resident.
and for the record, chief,
somebody had to stand up for that little girl,
and I make no apologies for that.
you want to just be a resident? Fine.
all right, then.
that woman is a victim of domestic violence.
this hospital is supposed to be a safe place
for her to come and tell her story.
and as her doctors, it is our job to help her.
you did not do your job.
instead, you further battered a battered woman.
what about that little girl? - Dr. Grey, you will stay away from that child.
you will stay away from that family.
you will not come within 100 feet of them.
and if you do, you will be suspended from this hospital.
pending re-evaluation of your emotional and mental fitness for residency.
the i. v. c. and the aorta are nicked.
o' Malley, get in there with some clips.
I'm gonna need the angular vascular clamp.
nothing's stopping. He's still bleeding out.
don't move, Yang.
I need some more suction in there.
I know Richard Webber is your friend.
this is not about Richard.
it is. It is about him.
because I have to deal with him
on a professional basis every day,
and I have tried to draw a line, and he won't respect it.
he doesn't respect it.
and he uses his relationship with you.
richard doesn't uses
stop defending him. Be on my side.
I need you to be on my side. - Okay.
he's not your best friend. He's not your Cristina.
which is why I feel like it's okay to say to you.
he is not invited to our wedding.
because I swear, Derek, if he is there, I won't be.
and I'm the bride, so I have to be.
so I'm begging you, please. He's not invited, okay? - Okay.
thank you. Mm-hmm.
if you don't make this deal, who's gonna pay your bills, - Who's gonna take care of you? - They tried to kill me, just like they killed Kaili,
just like they killed all of those defenseless trees,
all of the defenseless creatures that live in those trees.
you are not a defenseless, tree-living creature, Karen.
you are an adult woman
who made a conscious decision to trespass.
it was unbelievably stupid, unbelievably naïve.
just unbelievably irresponsible.
what about the part that it is unbelievably brave - Excuse me? - Trees may not be my thing,
but even if I thought it was stupid, it was still brave.
I mean, she slept in a 200-year-old tree
and watched as a bulldozer knocked her off of it
because she was standing up for what she believed in.
you have to admit, she's unbelievably freakin' brave.
how can trees not be your thing.
Karen? Karen?
damn it. Her pulse is weak. Let's start her on 0-2.
see if you can get a femoral pulse.
okay, she's bleeding out from her femur.
we need to get her stabilized.
what's going on? What's happening with my sister?
Julie, you need to clear out.
tell me what's happening with my sister - Get her out of here, please. - Tell me what's happening.
put the l. r. on a rapid transfuser and hang p-rbcs.
get ready for transport, tell the o. r. we're on our way now!
damn it! Damn it! There are too many bleeders.
hang another bag of o-neg and get me some fibrin sealant.
can I help? - You are helping.
you've got more bleeders than you have hands.
sorry.
no, no, that's it. You, get in here and take over for Yang.
yang, run to my truck. - What?
run to my truck. It's where I always park it.
run fast. In the glovebox, there's a green bag.
pull harder on that retractor, would you?
really get in-- - I'm a surgeon.
I'm trying to save a life here, Yang. Run!
Ooh, the lover's card.
do you know what this means?
Yes. No. Yes.
I'm--mom, can you please just shut up? Okay?
it's meat. Definitely some kind of meat.
you're killing me, you know that?
it means that the sex is hot. Hmm?
now I bet that little old mole doesn't get in the way there am I right?
honey, hey, listen,
isn't it time for my scan?
isn't it time for my scan right now?
I'll-- I'll go check, see if I can get things moving on.
thank you.
so tell me about Dr. Hottie.
how long have you all been together?
mom...
it's not just a mole.
I have stage iv melanoma.
it's in my organs. It's not just a mole.
now you don't have skin on your organs, honey.
that doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
don't just sigh at me, Isobel.
just, you know, just explain.
okay. Um...
you remember when-- when Grammy had that tumor on her thyroid?
Grammy died.
she died. She...
really soon after that, she died.
wh-- What are you t-- telling me...
you have a mole.
I don't understand.
you-- you just-- you have a mole.
okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
that was a really bad comparison.
what I have is nothing like what Grammy has. - No. No.
okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
just breathe. It's okay. I'm okay.
just breathe, okay? It's okay.
it's okay. I'm okay.
just breathe.
now I've got a good feeling about this.
I think those mets are shrunk way down,
and I think I'm gonna go right in and take the rest out.
Really? You think that?
did your psychic tell you so?
this scan has to be good. It has to be good.
take easy. L-listen, if it's not, it's not the end of the world.
there are other therapies that we can try.
she won't leave. If this scan isn't good,
if I can't give her good news, she won't leave.
I love my mom. I don't mean to sound ungrateful. It just...
it was me. I called her.
I really... I really thought it was Alex or George.
it was me because...
look, I would want to know if my kid was sick,
and if I was sick, I would want my mom.
I just thought that you were being too proud
or that you were just trying to protect her,
but now I get that you were just trying to protect yourself.
she's not a bad person. She was a great mom.
she's just... limited. She's... limited.
the scan has to be good.
it has to be good.
hang more blood. - Right away. - Come on, Willow.
come on, you lived in a tree.
you crapped in a bucket, for god sake.
you can do this. - She crapped in a bucket?
what are you doing here? - Saw it on the board.
I've never seen an intramedullary rod put into a femur.
so... bucket. - Yeah. A bucket on a pulley.
she's, uh, up in a tree right?
so she lowers a crap bucket to her friend every day,
who empties it, cleans it, puts food in it
and then sends it back up the tree.
Oh, that's friendship.
Yeah.
you know, they teach us in med school
how not to care so much.
we drape the patients so we don't see their faces.
we do a thousand different things to care a little less.
but you care like crazy, and I love that.
and I'll keep loving that,
even if you decide to lie to your family.
nice work, Yang.
open the bag. See the bottle with the blue label?
open it and pour it into a sterile basin
and give it to O' Malley.
okay, shake it onto the wound right over the bleeders, - A lot of it. - What is this stuff?
uh, uh, we used it in the field all the time.
it's not f. d. a. approved, but it's saved a lot of lives.
when, uh, you don't have time to stitch a guy up,
you pour some of this on, and it just holds things
until you get him to an o. r.
Oh, look at that. It's locking up the entire wound. It replicates the body'
it's not a permanent solution, but it buys us some time.
B. p. is going up. He's stabilizing.
magical.
I think it's gonna be fine.
I think those mets are gonna be just teeny tiny.
it's, uh, mets, mom. Mets.
Mets? Like baseball?
Yeah, like baseball.
okay, uh, good news. Great news.
the cancer's practically gone.
it looks like your psychic was right, Mrs. Stevens.
looks like we caught it early after all.
Oh, thank you, god! Thank you.
Oh, my baby.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph,
thank you, thank you, thank you.
Oh, thank you! Oh.
thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you.
but I knew it.
didn't I?
I knew it.
I knew because you're my Cricket.
nothing can happen to you.
I love you, mom.
Oh, I love you, too, my baby girl.
I love you so, so much.
God, look at me. I must be a mess.
well, I'm gonna go clean up, okay?
and then, uh, and then I'm gonna call Jade...
and Mrs. Norris, too.
I got them all so worried. Oh.
just tell me.
the mets have shrunk some,
but there are new mets, too.
several new mets in the small bowel.
no surgery, then.
Oh, I'm gonna operate.
I'm going to take out absolutely everything I can,
be as aggressive as I can,
and then we'll take it from there. Okay.
okay.
you just have to give her some room.
you two have history.
I apologized.
I know, and it's loaded.
she keeps yelling at me that I am not her father.
well, I'm not.
I fell in love with her mother. That's all I did.
her mother never got over you.
and she does not gonna well, that's not my fault.
look, I was young. Lots of people have affairs.
they have affairs, and they don't.
look, what Ellis did after I left?
that's on Ellis.
and I'm trying to run a hospital here.
she's doing the best she can, Richard.
well, her best isn't good enough. If any other resident
if any other resident pulled the crap she did today...
she is still here because of my history with you.
that's it. That's the only reason.
you keep saying you're not her father, but...
okay, you know what? Since we're talking,
you're the most professional guy I know, most levelheaded,
except when it comes to Meredith Grey.
you gave me hell.
you know, you weren't gonna give me chief
because I was dating Meredith Grey.
you told her about the ring.
you sent her out to the woods to bring me back.
that's not running a hospital.
you paged her to your office to try on dresses.
you paged her again today for Thatcher.
you have history with her.
you keep saying that you're not her father.
but the way you act? You consider her family.
for what it's worth...
what happened?
hunt is incredible.
the guy shouldn't be alive. 17 bullets.
he has one lung. He's got one kidney left.
Dr. Grey. Meredith.
I'm sorry for the way I spoke to you earlier.
Dr. Grey. Meredith, don't.
I know I was out of line, and I know
I can't possibly imagine what you've been through.
but I also know that this cannot be your daughter's story
that she shot her dad 17 times to protect her mom,
and you went back to him.
you have to change her story
while you still have a chance, for both of you.
but for her, but for your little girl...
you have to change her story.
I'll pack my stuff.
she lost a lot of blood, but she's stable now.
they weighed the cost.
I'm sorry?
they weighed the cost of killing her
over letting her stay up there.
and then they got a bulldozer.
and they knocked her out of a tree.
they knocked my baby sister out of a tree.
Jules.
I'm here.
Hey, I'm here.
I filed a lawsuit against Schuster and Werner.
a $10-million lawsuit.
we're gonna make those bastards pay for this.
you hear me?
I'm gonna make them pay.
we could plant so many trees with $10 million.
and when we win,
the check will be made out to Karen.
our tree girl made it through?
I can't lie, even if they think I'm wrong,
even if they don't understand,
even if they think I'm crazy.
I'm me.
they're supposed to accept me.
they're supposed to support me.
they're supposed to love me, you know?
I can't lie.
Oh, great.
is this another heart-to-heart?
I know you don't like me.
and you have every right not to like me.
I have abused my power, but now I'm here on your turf,
and what I need to say...
what I need to say is...
I saw what your mother was doing.
I saw how neglected you were,
I saw her drive your father off,
and I spent a lot of time beating myself up about that.
but what does that do for you?
nothing. Nothing.
I wasn't your advocate.
I didn't fight for you.
I never stood up for you.
I let myself off the hook.
I told myself I was young and didn't know any better,
but I did know better.
I wasn't much younger than you are now.
I should've fought for you, Meredith...
like you fought for that child today.
I told myself that I wasn't your father,
that it wasn't my responsibility,
that I was right not to butt in.
I let myself off the hook.
you were helpless.
you were... you were a baby...
a beautiful...
smart, funny little girl...
and no one stood up for you.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
as doctors, we can't undo our mistakes,
and we rarely forgive ourselves for them,
but it's a hazard of the trade.
but as human beings,
we can always try to do better, to be better,
to right a wrong even when it feels irreversible.
are you sure you don't want me to stay?
I'm sure.
I'm okay.
I'll be okay.
well... if you're not, you know where to find me.
I love you, mom.
I love you so much.
but we do better
love in' each other from a distance.
you were always too good for that trailer park...
that I knew.
I might not know that much,
and I might not be quite as smart as you, but...
I always knew that.
of course "I'm sorry" doesn't always cut it.
maybe because we use it so many different ways.
as a weapon, as an excuse.
nice work today.
"nice work today"? Seriously?
I'm sorry?
run to my truck.
you've got O' Malley clipping bleeders,
and you're telling me to run to your truck.
you know what my truck looks like. O' Malley doesn't.
and that--that run you took? It saved a guy's life. Yeah.
all day you were teaching O' Malley and you ignored me.
o' Malley wants to...
you've already declared cardio.
I didn't do anything wrong today.
I treated you like I would anyone else.
no, not like anyone else.
"take care now"?! What is that?!
what, are you, like, you know, happy now?
what-- what are you?
you know, just a "choke 'em and forget 'em" kinda guy?
hey there now. Take care now.
"nice work, Yang." What is this?
it's my shrink. My shrink gave me these sentences.
we-- we, uh, we came up with them together.
they're all 3-word sentences.
so I'd have things to say to you
instead of the three words that are...
that are killing me...
the three words that you know I feel.
but I can't say them,
because it would be cruel to say them.
because I am no good for you.
I don't want to torture you.
I don't want to look at you longingly.
when I know I can't be with you.
so, yeah, I'm smiling.
and I'm saying "take care now."
I'm letting you off the hook.
I'm trying.
I'm trying so hard to let you off the hook.
I'm trying to make it right,
what I did to you.
can't you see that?
I'm just trying to make it right.
take care now.
but when we are really sorry,
when we use it right,
when we mean it...
we're leaving... for good.
we're leaving.
and as I understand it,
you'll be too weak to follow us anytime soon,
so I'm pretty sure you won't be able to follow us later.
so... we're here to say good-bye.
Maddy, say good-bye to daddy.
this is the last you'll be eying of him.
Bye, daddy. Feel better.
Bye, Dr. Grey.
Bye, Maddy.
when our actions say what words never can...
sorry I'm late.
uh... d-dad,
this is, um, Mark Sloan.
Dr. Mark Sloan. He-- he's my, uh-- teacher?
no, no.
he-- he's my...
he's... Mark.
nice to meet you, Mr. Grey.
it's so nice to meet you.
please, grab a chair.
okay, that tastes like shrimp.
Alex...
okay, but listen, the shrimp kinda tastes...
sweet and spicy,
you know, kinda like our first date.
the good part,
the part before I didn't kiss you on the front porch.
okay, nice.
and the chicken tastes like a drive to the beach
with the windows down
and the dog hanging out the window,
like when you were a kid, like, salty.
it tastes good, but I'd definitely go for the shrimp
if we have to choose.
there's one more.
okay, yeah. Ugh. That tastes like crap.
okay, the o. r. 's prepped and ready. How about you?
Yeah, ready.
now I taste like crap.
when we get it right, "I'm sorry" is perfect.
Hey, so, um, we have to
move the wedding up for Izzie.
she's...
okay.
you're packing up your mom's journals.
Yeah.
you know, there's nothing in these for me.
I keep thinking, but I don't know.
I don't want to throw them away,
so I was gonna give 'em to the chief.
and...
he can come to the wedding if you want.
he can come.
okay.
when we get it right... "I'm sorry" is redemption.
when something begins, you generally have no idea how it's going to end.
the house you were going to sell becomes your home.
the roommates you were forced to take in become your family.
and the one-night stand you were determined to forget becomes the love of your life.
how long have you been up?
all night. I was trying to figure out how to get the tumor out of Izzie's brain.
why are you smiling?
cause I figured out how to do it.
once Izzie's in the clear, we're gonna go to the Bahamas and have our wedding on the beach.
the one & only beach club -- you can actually have drinks during the ceremony.
are you sure you're okay to be up and around?
Yes. I have good days and bad days.
Plus, I don't want to spend our entire honeymoon in a hospital bed.
this is not our honeymoon. - It totally is.
come on. I want you to meet my friends.
I know all your friends.
you know all my doctor friends. I'm a patient now.
you're gonna meet my patient friends, and they're gonna love my new husband.
don't make a big deal. - I'm not gonna make a big deal.
I'm a bride.
iz, come on. I'm getting her a real one.
I love this one, and that makes it a real one.
okay, everybody, this is Alex, my husband.
husband, this is Austin, Star, Meg, Miguel and Alison.
can you turn him around so we can see the butt?
Yes. Alex?
what, are you kidding me? - No.
Oh, a big trauma just came in. That's...
that's quality booty. - Right?
congratulations, Izzie. - Thank you.
so, uh... I had a good session with my shrink this morning.
did you talk to her about your mom?
I mean, have you seen your mom yet?
cause she lives, like, you know, a few miles away, and she thinks you're still in Iraq.
Yeah, I--I'm planning to see her.
when?
Dr. Hunt... I'm not on trauma today?
follow me, O'Malley.
lieutenant Lowell, I'm Dr. hunt. We spoke on the phone.
major Hunt, it's good to finally meet you. My C. O. has told me a lot about you.
Ah, you shouldn't believe anything Steve Mason tells you.
this is Dr. O'Malley, and you've already met Dr. Torres.
I'm looking at Charlie's post-op scans, but I'm not finding anything functionally wrong with the leg.
except that I can't walk or run or move really without serious pain.
I've tried everything -- medications, physical therapy. Nothing works.
which could indicate nerve damage. - Or a chronic pain syndrome.
and we can definitely look into pain management procedures, but surgically, I'm afraid, uh, there's nothing I can do.
actually, there is.
you could cut it off.
you can cut it off and replace it with a prosthetic leg so I can get back to Iraq where I'm needed.
did you know that's why he was here?
no, but is it such an unreasonable request?
unreasonable?
cutting off a viable limb is dismemberment.
that kid made lieutenant at 19.
he was planning on spending the rest of his life in the military.
they gonna take him back with one leg?
there have been several lower-leg amputees who've returned to active duty with prosthetics.
voluntary amputees?
maybe. I don't know.
are you saying I have to turn this kid away?
his C.O. sent him here because he trusts me.
we could get another set of scans and then try an epidural for the pain.
Dr. Torres?
fine. Do an M.R.I. and an epidural.
I'll take a look at the scans, but if the leg is healthy, I'm not cutting it off.
Dr. Bailey, are you busy today?
that depends. You got any more dying children you want me to become overly attached to before they expire?
no. I have an 8-year-old neuroblastoma patient, and he's gonna live.
I can feel it in my bones.
so scrub in with me and see the joy.
um, Dr. Bailey.
may I borrow you?
who is Santa Claus?
an old white man who lives at the North Pole and enters people's homes inappropriately.
no.
I'm Santa Claus.
all systems ready.
Oh, no, you did not!
Oh, yes, I did.
the Da Vinci S.I.H.D. Surgical System.
tell me you didn't wait till I had all but left the general surgery program to buy us a Da Vinci!
care to take it out for a spin?
Santa.
Hey, I was thinking, you know, with, uh, Derek and Meredith getting married, they, uh, probably don't want us hanging out in the attic much longer.
so I was thinking I'd start looking for a condo.
perfect, and then you'd finally have a place of your own.
actually, I was, you know, thinking maybe you'd, uh, you'd come with me.
Absolutely. No, I-I-- I would love to see it.
I'm so happy for you.
how much of that did you hear?
you mean the part where you asked her to move in with you, or the part where she shot you down?
I was here for both.
by the way, it's just way too early for you to be moving in with Lexie.
you don't have to do everything I do.
this is not about you.
I have my own future to think about. Life is short.
look at what's going on with Stevens.
don't worry about Stevens. I got a plan.
you want to remove her hippocampus?
one of them. It's a common procedure for seizure patients.
removing her hippocampus could compromise her memory, her speech.
she wouldn't be able to practice medicine anymore.
I have performed this surgery hundreds of times.
on cancer patients? No, but it's
if you do the surgery, I could lose my memory?
it's unlikely, but it's possible.
and if you don't do the surgery?
we could shrink the tumor with I.L.-2.
if the tumor doesn't kill me first.
why take the chance? - Have you even done a Wada test to see how her memory would be affected?
putting her brain to sleep and asking her to remember a bunch of flash cards is not an accurate assessment of the post-surgical outcome.
but it would tell us whether or not she could function afterwards, and as Dr. Stevens' primary physician
fine, I'll do it. It's unnecessary
the surgery is unnecessary.
the tumor's already symptomatic. She's having hallucinations.
that's a nice ring.
Alex outdid himself.
we're gonna have beautiful kids, don't you think?
is four too many?
four is perfect.
ideally, it would be two boys and two girls -- one of which would definitely be a tomboy.
and I was thinking I should have them pretty close together, though that might be stupid.
why wait?
exactly.
that way, If I'm not able to practice medicine anymore...
you won't want to.
you don't think?
do you? - I'm asking you.
why do you keep agreeing with everything I say?
because I am you.
I'm your tumor. You're... talking to yourself.
right.
at least until you have surgery, if you have surgery.
are you gonna have surgery?
if Derek cuts the tumor out, I could lose my memory, and if he doesn't, I could die.
I don't know what to do. Alex, tell me what to do.
iz, I can't tell you what to do.
of course you can. You're my husband.
that's what husbands do. They stomp around telling their wives what to do.
it's your job.
no, my job is to support whatever you want to do.
I don't know what I want to do.
that's why I'm asking you.
okay, I have an idea.
let's put it to a vote.
all in favor of the surgery... - No, we're not voting. No one's--no one's voting.
opposed?
I'm opposed... To voting.
just decide for me. Please.
you don't have to know right now.
think about it.
I don't have time.
captain Mason told me that you saved his life at least four times in the field.
Yeah, and a couple of times in the canteen, but don't tell Mason I told you that.
so... you think I'll get to go back?
are you sure you want to?
I mean, why do you want to cut off your leg just to go back to the war?
don't you have family?
you know what it's like to have family who don't know you, who don't get you, maybe even don't like you?
Yeah, actually, uh, I have brothers.
me, too.
so there's that family, The guys I grew up with, and we've got nothing in common,
and then there's my guys in Iraq
my real family whatever we got into, we were in it together.
but here, I'm alone. I'm nobody.
and I've tried. You know, I've tried fitting in here.
I've tried being a regular person.
I've tried getting a job, but there aren't any.
there are a lot of things that I wanted to be in my life, a lot of things I wanted to do, but none of them's here.
this is Alison Clark. She was referred to me two years ago.
Mets in her brain, liver, kidney?
she ended up having five surgeries and extensive chemo, which worked, but then...
Oh, yeah, the mets came back.
that's when I started her I.L.-2 therapy.
and now... After three treatments in as many months...
the mets are gone?
the mets are gone.
Dr. Stevens should be patient.
she should give her therapies a chance.
as surgeons, we like to cut, but... Sometimes there's a better way.
let me retract that small bowel so you'll have better visualization.
you know what, chief? Thanks to Leo, you don't have to.
Leo? - Leonardo... Da Vinci.
here, here, watch this.
see?
540 degrees of wristed movement.
can't do that with a laparoscope.
or in open surgery. Feels pretty good, doesn't it?
Dr. Bailey, are you making lightsaber noises?
uh, not anymore, sir.
you know, Dr. Chalikonda at Cleveland Clinic is doing single-incision gall bladder removal through the belly button.
we could try that on the next one...
if you're up to it.
don't tease me, sir. - Oh, I'm not.
why should Dr. Chalikonda have all the fun?
it's impressive, but it took two years to get these results.
Yeah, but these two scans were taken three months apart.
but Izzie may not have three months.
that tumor could start bleeding in three days or three seconds.
and since when are you not about cutting?
since it may not be in the best interest of our patient.
and Derek's not acting in Izzie's best interest?
they're ready for us in radiology.
okay, Iz, I am going to show you a series -- a series of images that you want me to try to remember
once derek puts the right side of my brain to sleep.
hit me. show me what you got.
okay. Is that a schnauzer or a scottie?
how specific do I need to be?
dog's fine.
it's either a 727 or a 747.
plane.
Ooh, a 2-story Victorian mansion.
we would also accept the word "house." - Schnauzer, 747, mansion.
Schnauzer, 747, mansion.
or dog, plane, house.
I'm gonna put the right hemisphere of your brain to sleep now, okay?
dog, plane, house. dog, plane, house. ...
okay, now we just wait for the brain activity in that area to stop.
dog, plane, house. dog, plane... H...
okay, Iz.
can you tell me what you saw?
show her the cards.
um... What's this?
dog. Can you say dog?
what's my name?
just stick to the cards, Meredith.
you know my name. you can say my name.
m... - This is what I was afraid of.
okay, who's Alex?
iz, okay, you don't have to speak.
just nod your head for me if you know who Alex Karev is.
the test impaired your memory to such a degree that I have to strongly recommend you don't have the surgery.
Izzie, the test was the worst-case scenario.
the result has nothing to do with the surgery. - We don't know that.
what I do know is that not operating as every bit as risky as the surgery itself, if not more, but it's up to you.
what do you think?
I think he's talking to you, not me.
I'll leave you two alone to discuss this.
uh, I'll come with you. I have a couple of questions.
wait, Alex. - Just think about what you want to do for a second, okay?
I'll be right back.
you are not having this surgery.
I need you to not talk medicine to me, okay?
talk to me like I'm your friend, like I'm the guy whose cereal you eat in the morning, and tell me what to do.
Karev -- Please. Karev, I can't tell you what to do.
what if it was Meredith?
what would you do if you had to choose between spending a few more months with Meredith knowing she was gonna die
watching her hurt, watching her sick
or spending the rest of your life with someone who looked like Meredith but wasn't her anymore?
she's the one good thing that ever happened to me, the one good thing.
so I need to know what to do.
I need you to tell me -- what if it was Meredith?
I would ask her to have the surgery.
you couldn't remember anything.
you didn't know my name.
you didn't know who Derek was.
you didn't know who Alex was.
you couldn't even remember how to speak.
how come I don't remember any of this?
because the tumor is sitting right in the middle of everything that makes you you.
I was standing there talking to you exactly like I am now, only you weren't there.
you weren't you.
you were gone.
so what do I do?
well, Swender has a patient -- female, 22 years old, metastatic melanoma.
Alison Clark? - After three months of the I. L.-2, her mets were gone -- all of them.
you're not having this surgery.
don't do it.
that's my vote. Don't have the surgery.
I didn't. I freakin' hate surgery.
I'm hallucinating, Alison.
I have really long conversations with dead people and I see things that aren't...
like right now, for example, I'm pretty certain there aren't birds flying over your head
because this is a hospital and that would be weird, but that's what I'm seeing.
I have a brain tumor. Am I really not gonna let them cut it out?
I didn't let them cut out mine.
it's like... Okay, one minute, I'm this college kid, rowing crew and being an idiot and forgetting my sunscreen and thinking it doesn't matter because I'm me, and life has worked out pretty well for me.
and then the next minute, they're cutting into my body every other week.
I had 15 surgeries.
and then I said, enough.
forget it.
I'll row crew in heaven or whatever.
and then the I.L.-2 worked.
it worked.
I come here every three weeks, I get my medicine, and...
I don't have a brain tumor anymore.
look, Charlie, if we admit you, if we do what you're asking us to do, the pain in your leg...
there's no way of knowing if amputation will cure it.
but it might. - Yes, it might.
and once I get the prosthetic, then
uh, it will be months before I can even begin fitting you with a prosthetic,
which won't feel anything like a new leg, by the way.
it will feel like 5 pounds of metal that hurts and pinches.
and what if the army says no?
no, no -- What if they don't take you back?
they will. Chances are that -- you really want to take that chance, Charlie?
you're asking me to remove one of your limbs.
Yeah, you think I don't know that? You think I want to cut my leg off?
of course not.
am I sure about this? No.
the only thing I'm sure about is that I am in hell right now.
that I am sure of.
I've lost everything -- Everything I've worked for, everything that I care about
and I've traded it in for a 6-times-a-day pain-pill habit that doesn't even work.
so don't waste both our times by trying to scare me, because you do not scare me, Dr. Torres.
after everything I've been through, nothing scares me.
so are we gonna do this or not?
Dr. Robbins, Dr. Bailey just performed Seattle Grace's first single-incision gall bladder removal.
that's cool.
through the patient's belly button. - And now it's kinda creepy.
no, no. You shoulda seen it.
no scars, no bleeding, and about half the time it would've taken laparoscopically.
you want to do one after lunch? I've got another coli.
y-you don't mind?
Oh, well, also, I guess I'm on my own for this afternoon.
my neuroblastoma?
no, no, no, no. Don't worry. You don't have to.
you'll have the rest of your life to do neuroblastomas.
well, then I'll see you after lunch, sir.
okay. Chief.
Yes, Dr. Robbins.
chief... - Did you want to tell me something?
I am going to cry, and I just want you to know that I know that it's going to happen, and I just want you to ignore it.
and I'm not crying because I'm upset.
it's just what happens when I get mad at people of authority.
you're mad at me?
I am mad at you.
and I'm crying because you're the boss, my boss, which brings up my issues of authority and my dad, who you kind of remind me of.
not that you're old, but you command respect.
people respect you. I mean, I know I do, and I know Bailey does, which is why I'm mad.
because it's wrong, sir.
it's wrong and mean to use a robot to lure Dr. Bailey back into general surgery 'cause I don't have a robot.
all I have are little kids, and... they're not as fun as a robot.
and they're not shiny and--and new and silver and they don't have things coming out of their belly buttons, but...
I will fight you, and I will win... sir.
you think you can fight me and win?
Yes.
good luck.
because I have something that you don't have. I have joy... Sir.
what's going on?
Oh, we're just going over, uh, Izzie's I.L.-2 schedule.
Oh, for after the surgery?
I decided not to have the surgery.
what?
uh, maybe we should come back... - Yeah.
Dr. Yang. - Sure.
you're having the surgery. - What?
shepherd said this is your last shot.
but I dec -- Look, I am your husband, and I say that you are having the surgery.
what happened to,"this is your decision"?
that was when I thought you were gonna make the right one.
but you chose wrong, so now you don't get to make this decision on your own, because you married me.
it's not just your life at stake anymore.
it's my life, too, my life with you.
so you can tell Swender whatever you want, But I'm telling shepherd and I'm telling you, you're having the surgery.
she may be your friend, but that doesn't give you the right to go in and
and talk her out of a surgery you know nothing about.
you're not her doctor.
you're Swender's resident. What you did is not only inappropriate...
Derek -- It is unprofessional.
you crossed the line, Cristina.
no, she didn't. I did.
I'm the one who convinced Izzie not to have the surgery.
I'm the one you should be yelling at right now.
well, I'm gonna go now.
unless you want to apologize to -- Okay.
my mother disappeared right in front of me.
everything she had, everything she was -- Her dignity, her memory.
in the end, she wasn't even my mother anymore.
Izzie is not your mother.
she doesn't have an untreatable brain condition.
she has a tumor, and it can be treated.
don't make this personal, Meredith. - I wasn't.
you went to Izzie as her friend and you made up her mind for her.
so now as my resident, you go back there and change it, because this tumor will kill her.
quick consult, Dr. Yang.
what are you doing?
I've realized, the reason I haven't told my mother I'm back is because part of me is still over there.
I made a commitment to the army that I wasn't able to fulfill.
if my unit hadn't been destroyed, I would still be there.
so no wonder I can't sleep at night or--or look my mother in the eye.
no wonder you and I -- we can't move forward.
my work there isn't done.
until it is, I have no business being here.
so... I've decided to go back.
I have to go.
Cristina, come on. I'm sorry. - What. What am I supposed to say?
I could use your support.
you don't have it.
Dr. Torres.
Dr. O'Malley.
I just wanted to apologize for... - It's okay, Charlie.
you don't have to do that. - No, I do, 'cause you were both just trying to do your job in there, and your job is to put people back together,
not take them apart, and I get that.
and I know it doesn't make sense to you that I would want to go back to a place where people get hurt and die, but...
we're there because we're trying to help people, save people, same as you.
it's my job, who I am, it's...
if something happened, and suddenly you couldn't be a doctor anymore,
if someone told you you couldn't do it anymore, wouldn't you want to do everything you could possibly do to be a doctor again?
we haven't even been married 24 hours yet, and we've already had our first fight.
that's a good sign.
fighting leads to good makeup sex.
are you watching birds fly around my head again?
am I, like, totally Snow White right now?
I just don't want to hurt him.
he'll come around.
it might take a while, but once that tumor disappears, once you're back at work, cutting open other people,
he'll come around.
is it hummingbirds at least?
I really like hummingbirds.
we need to go talk to Izzie.
no, we are not talking Izzie into having surgery because your future husband is mad at you.
but he has a right to be mad because we didn't talk Izzie out of the surgery as her doctors, we did it as her friends.
no, our job as doctors is to present the options, answer questions and let the patient decide their course of treatment.
that is what we did.
right. Except I may have presented her options as ,"you're having the surgery over my dead body."
he has a right to be mad.
Oh, crap. - Who is it?
Izzie? What the -- what happened?
I don't know. Where's Swender?
Izzie, let me take over. - Izzie, come sit down.
the vessels and nerves are separated.
skin flap is done.
remind me again why I'm doing this.
someone please remind me again.
you don't know what's gonna happen to this kid, how many fights he could win, how many lives he could save.
if you don't do this, he's never gonna get the chance.
we're not doing harm.
we're not hurting him. We are saving him.
we're doing what he wants.
it's what he wants.
B.P.'s still dropping.
we need more blood. We need to move faster.
okay, I'm done. I'm at the end.
I didn't see any bowel perforation.
it's there somewhere. Run it again.
Dr. Swender-- Run it again.
Yes, ma'am.
so much for I.L.-2.
you think this is my fault?
you think I did this to her?
no, ma'am. - There is no cure for cancer, Dr. Yang.
there's only us, the two of us, right here, right now, fighting this thing as aggressively as we know how.
and sometimes that means pumping toxins into the patient to kill the cancer,
and yes, sometimes, not very often, but sometimes, those toxins kill the patient as well.
but Alison had three months to live when she first came to see me, and I have managed to keep her alive for two years.
so I am not about to give up on her or the I.L.-2 anytime soon, and neither are you.
I wasn't asking you to come see the condo.
I was asking you to move in with me... If that's what you want.
I do. - You do?
Yeah.
not right away. - No, of course not.
in, like, a year. - Ten years.
I'm sorry, what now?
Oh, um, well, because I'll-- I'll still be a resident for, like, six more years, and--and then I'd want to get my practice up and running.
so... how about seven?
how about five years? - I'll still be a resident.
so? Stevens and Karev are residents.
Meredith's a resident, Bailey's a resident-- all married or soon to be, and happily... or whatever.
I'm sorry. Are you asking me... to-- to-- to marry you?
no. Why? Would you?
um, should we be having this conversation?
no, probably not.- No, I-I-- that's... okay.
impressive work today, Dr. Bailey.
thank you, sir. It was fun.
Yeah, it was, wasn't it?
sounds like you guys had a good day.
how did the, uh, neuroblastoma kid do?
Oh, he was awesome. The surgery was totally easy, and he's gonna make a full recovery.
good. - That's kind of why I wanted you there.
cause the kids you can save almost make up for the ones you can't.
anyways, I'm gonna go monitor him post-op.
and then I'm gonna tell his family the good news.
you should stop by, come see the joy.
okay.
we had to resect part of her bowel.
unfortunately, we weren't able to finish the surgery because she was too unstable.
right now she's on a ventilator because she can't breathe on her own.
but, uh, you're gonna be able to finish the surgery, right?
Yes, if she stabilizes.
and then she'll be able to breathe on her own again?
your daughter's heart stopped during surgery,
which means her brain wasn't getting oxygen.
so it's unlikely she'll be able to come off the ventilator.
Oh, god. Oh, no.
you paged me. Are you okay?
no. I don't know what to do.
I don't know if I should have the surgery.
I think I'm gonna die either way. You gotta tell me what to do.
you know what to do. - No, i don't. I don't.
Yes, you do.
you're just scared to do it.
this back and forth is just fear.
but you've already made the decision.
you already made it. You made it the second you decided to fight this thing.
just look... where you started.
look where you are now.
I mean, now you're this... incredible surgeon... and teacher.
you're a doer, remember?
you know exactly what you have to do.
come in.
you can do it.
you can cut into my brain again.
okay.
you can do it, but... I don't want to end up a vegetable.
Izzie, you won't. - No, just listen.
I want the surgery, right now, but if something goes wrong, I don't want to end up on a ventilator.
so i'm signing a D.N.R.
please.
Alex-- Look, you went crazy.
when Denny signed that D.N.R. you went crazy.
is that what you want? You want me cutting l-vads?
no, I-- you want to wreck my career?
cause I will. I will freakin' cut l-vads before I let you
just st--just wait, stop.
you don't get to quit.
you don't get to quit on me.
please... tear it up.
the D.N.R.--tear it up.
where your eyes are supposed to be right now, I see white sandy beaches...
and there's an ocean behind your head, and there are ghosts wandering in and out.
I can't live like this.
and i can't live...
if something goes wrong in that surgery, I don't want any extraordinary measures taken to keep me alive.
it's not what I want.
I went crazy when Denny signed the D.N.R. because I didn't understand.
I didn't understand, but now I do.
and I need you to understand.
I don't want you to go crazy. I want you to have a brilliant career,
and I hope that I get to be here for that, but if I can't, I just want to go to the other side.
I don't know what's there, but it's gotta be better than hospital beds and tubes down my throat, so please...
please don't cut l-vads.
just... If it comes down to it,
just let me go.
and right now, kiss me.
please, please just kiss me, and close your eyes, because the beach is so distracting.
I always thought it would be me.
I'd get Alzheimer's like my mother and forget everyone.
let's go to city hall tomorrow.
I don't want to spend another day not being married to you.
okay.
it doesn't matter how good you are or how hard you work.
you can do all the research, you can master all the latest techniques,
um, you can be the best, you can be the best surgeon in the world...
but your patients are still gonna die.
cause the next day or the next month or next year, you know, they're just gonna get hit by a car
and there's nothing you can do about it.
I don't want you to die.
you okay?
I cut off a healthy leg.
I just cut it off.
it was for the patient's own good, but still, I feel like a butcher.
my miracle case is on life support.
I thought I had one... one miracle.
I hate this job sometimes.
I don't know why we do this.
come on.
come with me.
okay, what are we doing here?
we came to see that.
what?
the joy.
it comes around rarely, so rarely we forget it can happen.
but that... that's why we do this-- the joy.
we spend our whole lives worrying about the future...
planning for the future, trying to predict the future...
will you come with me?
as if figuring it out will somehow cushion the blow.
but the future is always changing.
got one more. He's a doctor.
he says he needs to do it today.
come in.
the future is the home of our deepest fears...
Hi, mom.
I'm home.
and our wildest hopes.
but one thing is certain...
when it finally reveals itself...
congratulations, doctor.
welcome to the army.
is never the way we imagined it.
doctors spend a lot of time focused on the future...
planning it... Working toward it.
but at some point, you start to realize, your life is happening now...
any changes overnight? -No.
not after med school, not after residency, right now.
this is it. It's here.
blink and you'll miss it.
Oh, it's the chief.
somebody better make a coffee run. You all look like hell.
I gotta be in surgery in ten minutes.
um, Mer, will you let me know?
we should go, too. It's probably gonna be a while.
shepherd said she'd wake up in the morning.
what did he tell you? Was that all crap? What did he say?
he said it may be a while.
she's gonna wake up.
Stevens still isn't awake.
and I'm having something of a day even aside from that.
so... don't take my face personally.
it's just my face today.
did you tell her?
uh, you should tell her, and don't take her face personally.
okay, well... On behalf of the department of pediatric surgery,
I'd like to welcome you to the fellowship program. You're in!
we're gonna get you a pair of wheelie sneaks.
Congratulations.
all right.
I know I didn't support you during this process.
in any event, I am behind you now.
I'm trying to be a big person here. How about you meet me halfway?
wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.
I have a headache.
you're up?
you're up and you're talking.
you talked, right?
talk!
I said I have a headache. Stop yelling.
page Shepherd!
I'm sorry.
Hey, what's with hugging O'Malley?
I slept, Cristina.
last night, I slept for the first time in...
I slept.
and, uh, I don't know, hugging O'Malley because you slept?
no, I hugged O'Malley 'cause he's got great news, which I'll let him tell you, but, yeah, I... I guess, yeah, maybe I hugged him because I slept.
and that's because of you, because you came with me to see my mom,
and then I slept, and I slept without nightmares.
that's not a small thing, Cristina.
that... that is everything.
I can be a better man.
I can be a better man for you, and if...
I hope, you know, if you'll let me, I can be a better man with you.
no, don't say anything. Just... just think about it, okay?
okay?
what-- Dr. Bailey, I need to tell you something.
Oh, not now, O'Malley.
I know. It'll be quick 'cause I gotta get to the O.R. to scrub in with the chief.
now I think you're gonna be mad at first, but I'm about to do something important,
and I'm very sure about this decision,
and I-I think eventually, you're gonna be proud.
but, you know, before that, you're probably gonna be like...
"what did you do?!" I'm...
I don't mean to imitate you-- you call that quick?
I joined the army to be a trauma surgeon.
I report for duty tomorrow.
you did what?!
Yeah, that's where I thought we'd start.
you know, something's going on with George.
what?
Owen hugged him. They were happy.
well, we don't hug when we're happy.
are you better? - What?
you know, with your therapy.
uh, whatever. You said you got well.
well, are you... better?
or are you just, you know, fake better? - What do you mean?
I'm asking you if people, you know...
I mean, are you actually different?
I mean, do you feel different?
I'm getting married today.
city hall. No muss, no fuss. Just quick and dirty.
well, uh... do you want me to come?
no, no. Just letting you know.
Oh, no, wait.
uh, uh... Okay, this is my grocery list.
it's old.
uh, this--this is new.
um, this is my favorite pen, so I want it back.
borrowed. And all of it's blue, so you're covered.
now see, if we were George and Owen, we would hug right now.
dude.
unidentified male, dragged by a bus.
he's clamped down, so we couldn't intubate.
didn't they stop when they hit him?
bus driver didn't know he was there until he got halfway down the block.
Oh, is he gonna be okay?
okay, I'll take over C.P.R..
push 20 etomidate and 100 of sux.
he saved my life.
the bus was gonna hit me. He threw me out of the way.
Grey, get her out of here.
it was supposed to be me under the bus.
he's all alone. They don't even know who he is. Please.
all right, stand over there and just don't move.
he's back.
okay, let's get a trauma series, trauma labs and o-neg blood in here.
severe avulsion injury to the left forearm.
okay, his skull is bashed in.
page Shepherd. - And Sloan.
start antibiotics and start cleaning out those wounds.
now can you get her out of here?
did you get the whole thing?
did you get the whole tumor out?
just let me finish my exam.
can you tell me your name?
my name is Isobel Stevens.
it's 2009.
and I'm in the... neuro I.C.U. at Seattle Grace Hospital.
did you get the damn thing out?
got the whole damn thing.
you got it? - Yeah.
Oh, god. You got the whole thing.
and I can talk and I know my name and I'm not a turnip.
Nope.
no offense. - Oh, no.
you are a great surgeon, but I really thought I was gonna be a turnip.
this is so unbelievably great.
your, uh, kidneys are a little sluggish, so we're just gonna keep an eye on your electrolytes for a few hours.
your post-op crit was-- was fine.
okay, good.
good. Good.
how did the surgery go?
did you get the brain tumor?
did you get it out?
iz, you just asked him that.
we just talked about it.
no, no, it's okay. She's gonna be foggy for a while.
the tumor's out.
there was a little bleeding during the post
you got it? - Yeah.
all of it?
that's amazing.
Derek Shepherd, you... are a hero.
and I know that that's Derek Shepherd.
and you're Alex.
and you should kiss me.
Alex... I don't have a brain tumor.
I'm tumor-free.
Yes, you are.
what's wrong?
why do you look weird?
no, nothing. Nothing.
uh, your kidneys are a little slow. We're just gonna watch them.
okay. So you'll just recheck my electrolytes in an hour?
okay.
how did the surgery go?
did you get the tumor?
we did.
the tumor's gone.
there was a little bit of bleeding, and we took care of that.
you got it?
Oh, my god.
and I can talk, and you didn't kill me.
what's wrong with you people? We should be celebrating.
she's like the woman who couldn't remember her husband was dead.
we had to keep telling her every five minutes.
could be a perfectly normal post-operative haze.
or the bleeding during the procedure blitzed her short-term retention.
did you screw up her brain?
I'll be back. Try and stay calm.
freaking her out is not gonna help.
wake up.
man versus bus.
the bus won. - Check out the left arm.
he's crashing again!
what do we got? - We got roadkill.
you mind? He stepped out in front of a moving bus so he could pull a woman out of the way.
he's a hero. - Can you fix the arm?
fingers are already blue.
if it's gonna happen, it's gotta be in the next few hours.
pupil's blown. Stop C.P.R..
okay, give me a cranial drill, please.
Grey, want to practice your, uh, burr holes?
stabilize his neck, please, nurse.
okay, hand her the drill.
okay, go in slowly.
when you feel it grab, stop, 'cause otherwise you're gonna be hitting the brain.
okay, let's go. Quickly.
pull back, pull back! That's it.
nice work, Dr. Grey.
I'm gonna go get some bacitracin for that face.
let's get his head rotated. Easy.
welcome back, sir.
you had us worried there for a minute.
you think he's gonna make it?
I hope so.
he really has to make it.
Dr. Sloan.
there's gonna be too much tension.
start over and do a layered closure.
um, c--uh, c-can I ask a question about that?
you brought up moving in together and marriage, and I put it off.
and now you're embarrassed and you won't make eye contact with me because you feel that I have all the power in the relationship, but I don't want all the power in the relationship.
I--I'm happy to share it.
can we just skip this part?
get some 4-0 Vicryl so you can redo your patient's sutures.
I'll totally pretend I didn't hear any of that.
women do this to me. I don't do this.
let's get a house together.
sucks being the girl, huh?
I'm not the girl.
what do girls do?
well, uh, we start with the cold shoulder, so you're right on track.
and we go to our girlfriends and we bitch,
and our girlfriends say, "you want to build a future," build it yourself.
you don't need a man to give you that.
so you want to buy a house?
buy a house.
you're good at this.
I ought to help someone get a love life.
I suck at my own.
he jumped in front of a bus... for me.
what did you do to O'Malley? - Excuse me?
uh, somebody else around here likely to convince someone to join the army and be a trauma surgeon in Iraq?
What?! - The army?!
what?
v-fib. - Charge the paddles to 360.
just call who you have to call and undo this.
Dr. Bailey, little busy here.
clear. - George? George O'Malley?
it wasn't my idea.
no change. - Charge again.
clear.
I did what I could to give him a decent education in trauma.
I didn't know he was gonna go and enlist.
he keeps coding. - Here's why-- open-book pelvic fracture.
there's too much bleeding.
we take him to an O.R. now, he'll die on the table.
he needs to go to angio if we're gonna stop the pelvic arterial bleeding.
sinus tach. We have a rhythm.
it's barely there, but it's there.
let's stabilize the pelvis.
I know what goes on in this hospital.
I know you're messed up from that war, and not in a small way.
get him out of it.
page me if you need me. I've got other patients.
how'd you piss off all the women?
um, let's get our guy to angio.
angio? He's barely got a pulse.
it's now or never if we want him to live. Let's move.
sir, I know it's tough, but I'd personally be very grateful if you'd try and stay alive for the next few minutes.
maybe we're bouncier in peds than in general surgery,
but I thought that there would be a "yay" or some jumping around.
cause you look pretty dour for someone who's about to start a highly prized fellowship.
you are about to start a highly prized fellowship, right?
Hey, I've got a plan to stop George. Are you in?
stop George from what?
he joined the army. Yes, I'm in.
Bailey, I'm talking to you.
why are you trying to stop him?
because he joined the army. - And?
and because he's my ex-husband,
and I know his mom and I love his mom,
and normally Izzie would talk sense into him,
but she's got cancer and kind of a bad mental deficit,
so it's on me to stop him.
but why would you want to stop him?
because he joined the army. Don't you think that's a problem?
I think that's awesome.
awesome?
you gonna chew?
my dragged-under-a-bus guy's in angio, and they're gonna page me any minute.
how's Izzie? Is she retaining anything?
no.
okay, uh, at 6: 00 p. m. your idiotic colleague George O'Malley will finish his surgery with the chief.
and at 6: 00 p. m. you will be standing beside us in the O.R. hallway, prepared to join in an intervention.
what polite company might call an intervention,
though I'm not sure interventions involve whooping people on the behind with a belt.
what, he's got a drinking problem now?
he joined the army.
What?! - 007?
he can't go to army. He's the guy that gets killed.
he's that guy who gets killed cleaning his own gun.
grey is going to coax him back as a loving friend.
you are going to use logic and reason to point out the idiocy of his ways.
Stevens will make sad cancer eyes.
and if all of that doesn't work, Karev, you're gonna pull out your "I was raised out back with the trash cans" roots
and just beat the crap out of him.
6:00. - 6:00.
hey there.
I know this must be scary, but if it's any consolation, you're a hard-core hero.
you saved that woman's life.
I-is he trying to write something?
can you hold this?
Oh, okay.
you'll be stronger tomorrow.
call O.R. One. Tell 'em to get ready for him.
Amanda, you can't be out here.
would you want to be all alone at a time like this?
we had 30 seconds of interaction before he saved my life, and...
and I wasn't even nice.
I was standing on a corner when this...
ordinary-looking guy stands next to me and smiles, and...
and I'm so busy scoping for someone hotter that...
I don't even give him a second look.
and next thing I know, he throws me out of the way of a bus I'm about to walk in front of
and almost gets himself killed.
he literally... He swept me off my feet.
that is my prince in that bed.
okay, you can stay until they take him to surgery.
uh, not a good time.
you know what? You walk away from me again, I swear I will grab you by the hair and pull hard.
I grew up with the name Arizona.
I learned how to play dirty on the playground.
I stuck my neck out for you. You were my pick.
and I appreciate that, but it's a big decision.
it's not, frankly. It's the brass ring.
it's the most exclusive, it's the most competitive, and we're as good as it gets.
nobody lands this thing and says no.
my husband informed me yesterday that if I accept the peds fellowship,
if I sign on for another two years of training
and the hours and the workload that come with it when I could be a general surgery attending
and make it home for dinner, he will divorce me.
it's a big decision.
you're gonna have a hard time saving that arm.
I can get him back to full function if I can get there in time.
I'm thinking about buying a house. - Good for you.
Meredith and I are gonna go to city hall this afternoon.
we're getting married. - Really?
that's great news. - I know.
if I could just save Stevens-- - You're allowed to be happy.
you're allowed to get married.
you've earned that right.
congratulations, you lucky bastard. Come here. Give me a hug.
why is everyone hugging today?
Oh, the blushing bride.
all right, here is the plan for our John Doe.
shepherd, you'll evacuate the epidural.
grey and I will correct the internal injuries.
that'll make room for Torres to place the internal fixator.
Sloan, you should still have time to work on the arm if the patient doesn't get too acidotic or hypothermic.
do you think he has a shot?
I've seen people come back from worse.
Hey, I thought you were in surgery.
I'm on my way.
have you talked to Bailey about this peds and Tucker thing?
no, I talked to Bailey about the army thing and George.
are you upset with me?
no, I'm awesome.
Calliope-- No, do not-- do not "calliope" me, okay?
you said it was awesome.
George-- sweet, kind George who can't even kill a fly
is joining the army to go to Iraq in the middle of a war, and you said "awesome."
it is awesome. - No, it is not awesome.
God! Who are you?
how's the arm?
the nerves are still intact. Just have to reattach the vessels.
you ready for me?
I'm almost done with the major internal crush injuries.
pelvis will be all yours in a minute.
give me some more laps, please.
you think you could do it?
step in front of a bus for a perfect stranger?
we'd all like to think we would, but
that's more or less what Major Hunt's been doing every day for the last couple of years.
Oh, no, the guys did.
I just came in behind 'em with a dustpan and a broom and swept up.
you sewed up soldiers under fire.
you didn't sweep up.
how do you think O'Malley is gonna do over there?
you think--you think he can handle it?
no, I don't.
I think he's gonna surprise us all.
I think he's coming back in a body bag.
I think you all should just shut up.
just shut the hell up.
please. Shut up.
shepherd got your whole tumor out.
Oh, my god.
Alex, why didn't you tell me? Oh, my god.
your memory sucks - Oh. - But we're working on it.
you remember what time you woke up this morning?
um, not exactly.
O'malley joined the army? What? - Yeah, he's gonna be a trauma surgeon in Iraq.
When'd you wake up?
7:45. He's gonna get killed.
Yeah, we're dealing with it.
did you know about this George thing?
Yep. Cannon fodder.
I'm just gonna take some more blood.
last time we checked, your potassium was 6. 3. When'd you wake up?
um, early. I can't quite remember. I...
7: 45. 6. 3. 7: 45.
O'malley joined the army?
George? - We're dealing with it.
what's your potassium?
uh, I... - Iz, what's your potassium?
you know what? Why don't we just give her the chart to read and try and memorize, okay?
and I can talk to you about her hyperkalemia.
look, she just had brain surgery and an incredibly aggressive course of I.L.-2. She needs rest.
she needs to exercise whatever memory she's got left before it all turns to mush.
well, she's not gonna heal with you barking orders at her like a caveman.
butt out, Yang. - No, she's my patient.
I don't care if you're her husband. - Look, she
you want to see how fast I can get your visiting hours down to zero?
she signed a D.N.R..
she signed a friggin' D.N.R. and made me promise she'd come outta this with a life.
not in a hospital bed, not with no brain,
I had to promise she'd have a life.
you want to know what happens if she can't make any new memories?
forget about being a doctor.
she's gonna need round-the-clock babysitters.
we get an apartment together, and she can't ever find her way to the damn toilet.
tracker on her ankle in case, god forbid, she wanders out the front door!
Alex, you can handle this.
she will get better. - Maybe. Maybe not.
it's on me. Her future is on me.
is he gonna be okay?
we'll know more in the morning.
go ahead.
how's she doing? Any better?
no. - Damn.
well, I'm going to city hall to go - do the thing. - Seriously?
it doesn't seem like the day for it.
look at alex.
he's in there working so hard all day, and she doesn't know.
and if she stays like this, she may never know how much he loves her.
and that girl Amanda... She's in there loving a stranger.
she thinks that's her prince charming.
I mean, he's probably gonna die today, chances are.
so yeah, I'm gonna go get married.
because I think it's important to take the time to tell the people you love how much you love them while they can hear you.
I love you, Cristina Yang.
you have changed.
maybe I have.
what?
I'm gonna hug you.
maybe I don't understand people. I don't see things.
so maybe I just don't get what's going on with you or why you're so mad,
but I do think it's awesome. I think that George joining the army is awesome.
um, shut up. - Um, no.
you asked me who I was.
I am a person who thinks that what george is doing is dangerous and terrifying and brave.
he's going to serve his country.
he's going to risk his life to save the men and women
who make it possible for you and I to sleep safely in our beds.
I'm a person who thinks that that is brave.
and I am a person who stood in an airplane hanger
and watched them unload my brother's body in a coffin...
and all we got was a flag.
my brother died over there because there weren't enough doctors, Callie.
so for my money, George O'Malley is a patriot.
he's a hero, and I am grateful that he exists.
so yeah, the word I use is "awesome."
that's who I am.
I'm sorry.
sorry, I-I didn't realize-- - Oh, no, no, wait.
I... love... you.
well, I-I-I love you, too. - No, just...
I love you.
I said-- I said "I love you."
me.
you traumatized me. And you know that I am s
I am so sorry about-- - Oh, no, damn it. Not about the choking. It's...
it's like you come here and then you pull out my icicle
and you make me love you, and I can't
I mean, I don't want to-- I-I can't breathe without you.
you can do this. Cristina, we can do this.
all you have to do is just meet me halfway.
all you have to do is say yes.
all you have to do is say yes.
what's your crit?
this is disgusting.
I can't believe we serve it to the patients.
you keep asking for lime jell-o and don't like it.
so stop giving it to me.
you get mad if I don't.
okay, now what's your crit?
I don't know.
I'm tired.
what's O'Malley doing tomorrow?
joining the army.
I need a break.
you don't think I need a break?
suck it up.
What--god.
back off.
I'm sorry if this is hard for you,
but you are not the one with the short-term memory of a carrot.
go ahead. Get it off your chest.
it's not like I'm gonna remember in five minutes.
okay, I'm not the one with a carrot for a brain, but I'm married to it 'cause of some crock of a wedding we walked into, and only because the two of us thought you'd be dead within a week.
you made me promise you that you wouldn't live like this.
so now what the hell am I supposed to do,
smother you with a pillow, shoot you up with a-an overdose of morphine?
not really psyched about that.
leave you? - Not really psyched about that either.
so I guess I'm kinda screwed, right?
I mean, not as bad as you, but not a friggin' walk in the park, either.
I'm sorry, Iz.
no.
I told you to get it off your chest. You did.
did you forget yet?
Nope. Not yet. Give me a minute.
um... j-- If there's still a spot for me in general surgery,
I'd like to take you up on that.
I spent months trying to talk you off peds.
I finally get on board, and you change your mind?
Tucker gave me an ultimatum
the fellowship or our marriage.
you chose your marriage.
no, I'm leaving him,
because a marriage that resorts to ultimatums, that's not a marriage.
I mean, what kind of husband does that?
so... I'm going to be a single mom.
it's not the time for... new specialties.
damn.
I'm sorry.
it's just the first time I said it out loud, so it just kinda took the wind out of me.
Miranda, are you sure about this?
I mean, he might come around.
he... he's just scared. - Well, we're all scared.
I mean, if you're not scared, you're not paying attention.
o-one of my residents just signed up to go to war. That's scary.
another one just almost lost her life to melanoma.
now she doesn't know what day it is. That's scary.
what Tucker's facing isn't scary.
he's just weak.
no, a pat on the back isn't gonna help, sir.
um, should I go?
uh... Okay.
okay. Okay.
I'll just stand here with you if that's all right.
Yes, sir. That would be fine.
I thought you were operating on John Doe.
I already did.
right now I'm looking at houses. One has a stone fireplace, which I like.
this one has a backyard the size of Montana.
you're buying a house?
Yeah. - Right.
okay.
I'm buying a house right now.
it's a buyer's market, and I'm buying a house.
the only reason that you're even talking about a house is to make me feel bad.
you're trying to prove that you're moving on without me
so then I'll regret my decision and change my mind.
okay, is this what women are doing when they say they're moving on?
Yeah. They don't usually take out a home loan to do it, but
pathetic. Let me be clear. I'm moving on.
I'm a better woman than you.
ready to go?
I just got a page. Our John Doe needs to go back into surgery.
Yeah. His post-op C.T. showed a rebleed.
I'm gonna have Nelson take care of it.
no, really? - Yeah. Well, I'd prefer to do it myself,
but I want to check in on Izzie.
maybe we can go do that first and then go get married after?
no, we can't because we have the George intervention after that.
I'll have Nelson do it. - You know what?
tell them to prep him. We'll run to city hall, we'll come back and we'll do it then.
Meredith-- - No, you know, let's go.
we gotta go. We gotta run to city hall, we'll come back, you'll check on Izzie, we'll monitor John Doe, I'll go talk George out of joining the army
look, we could do this another day.
there is no other day.
every day is like this.
every day there's a crisis.
there's no time.
Meredith-- - I love you, and I do want to marry you today, but there is no time.
you have a piece of paper? - For what?
I want to be with you forever,
and you want to be with me forever.
and in order to do that, we need to make vows, a commitment, a contract.
give me a piece of paper.
I don't. I-I-I don't.
I-I have post-its.
okay.
what do we want to promise each other?
that you'll love me...
even when you hate me.
to love each other even when we hate each other.
no running... ever.
nobody walks out no matter what happens.
no running.
what else?
that we'll take care of each other even when we're old and smelly and senile,
and if I get Alzheimer's and forget you...
I will remind you who I am every day.
to take care when old, senile... and smelly.
this... Is forever.
sign.
this is our wedding, a post-it?
if you sign it.
now what?
now I kiss the bride.
married.
married.
see that?
plenty of time.
gotta do an E.K.G..
what, I don't even get any small talk?
what's your problem? - Well, I'll tell you.
I know that I'm supposed to be grateful for my "new lease on life,"
but Alex marched in here and basically told me
that being married to me was the worst thing that ever happened to him.
Yeah, and that he was trying to decide if smothering me with a pillow was the best way to put us both out of our misery.
okay, where is it?
where is what?
Where's the note that says that? Did you write that down?
no.
no.
Yes. Yes.
I've gotta go. I've gotta find Alex.
go, go.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was just-- I was looking for George. Bailey, it's after 6:00.
Yes, uh, we scheduled an intervention
so that we could give O'Malley a piece of our minds about this idiotic army business.
now did he leave already?
he never scrubbed in.
he told me he was enlisting. I sent him home,
told him to spend the day with his mom since he was leaving so soon.
uh, he took off this morning.
how's his I.C.P? - Worse. O.R. is expecting us.
I thought you were getting married.
we did. - Oh, congratulations.
you sure you want to start your honeymoon in an O.R.?
we're sure.
you can't be in here.
I'll come and get you in the waiting room.
hold his hand until you put him under.
it really does make him feel better.
well, you made a good friend there.
I guess that happens when you take a bus for somebody.
I know this is scary, but you do have a great team up there.
you want to try to write again?
can you hold the pen?
Okay,"o.," "o."
double 0... 7.
Oh, god! Oh, god.
you paged me. What do you need?
well, way to go, dipwad.
telling your wife you're trying to figure out how to off her?
Oh, mind your own bus-- Wait.
how did you know that? - She told me.
you remember?
pillow or morphine. I got the whole thing.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean that.
of course you didn't.
you love me too much to shoot me up with morphine even if I asked you to.
and my stupid corked brain is coming back.
Oh, my god. I was so scared.
I mean, I would've loved you no matter what, but...
you're back. you're back.
it's George! It's George!
it's George! John Doe is George!
Izzie, look at me. Open your eyes!
page Shepherd. Page the chief and Bailey right now.
we have you, O'Malley. You hear me?
we have you. We'll fix this. Just stay with us.
O'malley, it's Shepherd. You're not going anywhere. You understand me?
B. P.'s dropping.
all right, let's put him out, now.
what happened? - Is it her brain?
no, it's hyperkalemia. - We couldn't control the arrhythmias.
her pressure's dropping off a cliff. - Give me an intubation tray.
she signed a D.N.R. - Shut up, Yang.
she knew this might happen. That's why she signed it.
I don't give a crap what she signed.
Alex, it's not what she wants.
get a crash cart!
Karev, if she doesn't-- - Look at her!
get a crash cart!
screw the D.N.R.. Hand me those paddles.
yang, take over compressions.
Karev, back up. - I got it. I got it.
and down.
okay, down.
did you say it?
I love you...
clear.
I don't ever want to live without you...
you changed my life... Did you say it?
make a plan...
set a goal...
work toward it...
but every now and again, look around...
drink it in.
cause this is it.
we're losing him!
come on.
when you get sick, it starts out with a single bacterium...
one lone, nasty intruder.
pretty soon, the intruder duplicates...
becomes two.
then those two become four...
and those four become eight.
then before your body knows it...
it's under attack.
you can't put that in there.
Oh, they told us to grab a cubby.
Yeah, I know. It's just... we keep it empty for a reason.
can you just take your stuff out?
there are some empty ones over there you can use.
I don't think so.
I said take it out.
great. I got the crazy one next to me.
Oh, you want to fight? 'Cause I will.
I will fight you you're pretty tiny.
come on. Come on. - I could take you down in just a couple of seconds.
come on. Stop.
it's an invasion.
the question for a doctor is, once the invaders have landed, once they've taken over your body...
they took George's cubby.
how the hell do you get rid of them?
there should be at least a couple of days where they act like guests before they put their feet up on the coffee table.
and what's with the orange scrubs?
what, ours aren't good enough for 'em? We ran out.
they're on back order. Randall from the supply company says there'll be here in a week.
that's what you learn when you lie here all day.
why bother ordering new ones?
we could just give these to our replacements. We're not gonna be replaced by anybody.
if I have to become a coroner... - No one is becoming a coroner.
Cristina, tell him.
tell him what? They're here. It's over.
we are not some stupid hosts.
they can't invade us.
they can't attach themselves to our faces and then while we're eating spaghetti, explode out of our chests and skitter across the floor.
this is our ship.
this is our ship.
excu me. Are you-- are you quoting a Sigourney Weaver movie?
shut up. That's what happens when you live here.
you watch a lot of TV.
we own this hospital.
we were born in this hospital.
and we will hold this hospital with our last gasping breath.
I really don't want to be a coroner.
I don't like dead people.
go out there and go get surgeries before they take them. Go!
and I want a full report by the end of the day.
and what is wrong with you?
I-I don't know what I'm fighting for.
surgeries, Cristina. Surgeries.
there will be a cardio god here again one day.
and when there is, you don't want to be out of practice.
now go.
is this overflow from Mercy West?
Yeah, their--their E.R. closed for good last night. Everyone's coming over here.
another one of the perks from the merger.
Ah, our new attending. - First day back?
Yeah. - You picked a good one.
it's nice and quiet. A lot going on.
Yeah. Thank you.
okay, where do you want us?
uh, at this point, anywhere is good.
at Mercy West, we do zones.
when it's super busy, we just give everyone a zone, space.
the nurses put a person in that space, you know it's your patient. Helps you get to 'em quicker.
Yeah, well, this is the E.R.. Not a school yard. We're not playing four square.
I like it. - What?
it's a good idea. Let's try it. What's your name?
jackson Avery. - Dr. Avery, Dr. Hunt.
it's all yours. Zone away.
let's go.
ch - What do you need, Karev?
I know you still have cuts to make at the resident level, and I just want you to keep in mind that Izzie Stevens is not 100% back yet.
I mean, she's recovering.
look, she--she just-- she needs this.
I have a hospital to run, Karev.
I have two hospitals to run.
Hey, that wasn't cool.
what? In the locker room.
my friend should've left that cubby empty. I'm sorry.
well, she's obviously not, so-- it's the first day of school.
everyone's on edge. I'll probably kill someone before the day is through.
I'm Charles, by the way. Charles Percy.
it might be kinda hard for you not to talk to me all day.
it can be done.
I almost didn't talk to my family for a car ride across the whole country
10 days, 15 states, not a peep.
just read books, pretended I was a hostage.
well, nice to meet you, Izzie Stevens.
Hey, do you happen to know the key code to the research library?
I was here last night, and it was closed.
it took me two years to get that code.
I need every advantage I can get.
did the gentleman from the waiting room ever find you?
what?
it's the gentleman who could possibly be your father.
what?
daddy.
what... What are you doing here?
I came to see you.
Why?
Calliope, we used to talk. Every sunday, we used to talk.
I'd wait for your call, and you'd tell me everything, all about your crazy adventures.
even when you were in trouble, you'd still call, and we worked it out.
we'd always work it out. Hmm?
daddy.
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm sorry things got so... sure.
but the fact that you came...
daddy, is that Father Kevin?
Hello, Calliope.
Wh--are you t-- two here to...
you think you can pray away the gay.
we can just sit and talk.
Oh, no. You can't pray away the gay.
you can't pray away the gay!
the man flew 3, 000 miles to make me straight... with a priest.
I'm lucky they didn't march into the E.R.
swinging incense, all--all hepped up for an exorcism. - Are you done yet?
am I--no!
he came here to disinfect you from my life. You n't find that abhorrent?
I do, but-- there is no "but," okay?
Oh, what, you're gonna-- you're gonna tell me you get where he's coming from?
maybe you should try and talk to him.
I have nothing to say.
if he wants to throw away our relationship after 30 years, then that's his decision.
he hasn't done anything here.
you're the one who changed the game.
y-you didn't expect a little understanding when you came out to your parents?
uh... I never had boyfriends... ever.
I had a poster on my wall of Cindy Crawford, and I wasn't just looking at her mole.
it wasn't news to my mom when I brought somebody home named Joanne.
but you, you dated men your whole life. You loved men. You even married one.
you want to talk about 30 years of a relationship?
