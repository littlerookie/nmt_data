you EXPECT ME TO REMEMBER THAT FAR BACK?
I FIND THAT MURDER WEAPONS TEND TO BE UNFORGETTABLE,
and YOU DID TURN IN THE GUN THAT KILLED DARRELL TWO WEEKS AFTER HIS MOTHER FILED THE MISSING-PERSONS REPORT.
so, YES, I DO EXPECT YOU TO REMEMBER.
these KIDS TURN THEIR GUNS IN TO ME
under THE SEAL OF CONFESSION.
what ABOUT THE SACRED COMMANDMENT "THOU SHALT NOT KILL"?
this IS A PHOTO THAT DARRELL RICHARDS' MOTHER GAVE THE POLICE IN 1992.
do YOU RECOGNIZE ANY OF THOSE OTHER BOYS?
Yes.
can YOU TELL ME WHO THEY ARE?
MS.JOHNSON...
I HAVE SPENT A GOOD PART OF THE LAST 20 YEARS
burying KIDS I LOVE KILLED BY KIDS I LOVE.
and THE ONLY TIME ANYONE EVEN NOTICES
is WHEN SOMEONE WANTS TO THROW ONE OF THOSE KIDS IN JAIL.
society HAS FORGOTTEN US.
we DON'T NEED MORE PUNISHMENT DOWN HERE.
we NEED HOPE AND MERCY.
it's NOT MY JOB TO FORGIVE AND FORGET.
a BOY WAS MURDERED.
I ATTEND TO THE LIVING, CHIEF JOHNSON.
you ATTEND TO THE DEAD.
father, FATHER, DON'T YOU, UM...
don't YOU THINK THAT DARRELL'S MOTHER DESERVES TO KNOW
what HAPPENED TO HER SON?
[ exhales SHARPLY ] FINE.
okay.
here's DARRELL RICHARDS' MOTHER'S ADDRESS.
so...
you GO, AND YOU GIVE HER A LITTLE CLOSURE.
and THEN YOU LET DARRELL AND THIS COMMUNITY REST IN PEACE.
closure.
well, FATHER...
be CAREFUL WHAT YOU PRAY FOR.
yes?
Hello, I'M SERGEANT DAVID GABRIEL, MRS. RICHARDS.
we're WITH THE L.A.P.D. DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?
we ASSUMED DARRELL WAS DEAD 15 YEARS AGO.
we MOURNED HIM 15 YEARS AGO.
Provenza: I MET DARRELL ONCE, MRS. RICHARDS,
outside OF FATHER JACK'S PLACE.
he WAS A VERY NICE KID.
he WAS A NICE KID AFTER HE MET FATHER JACK.
Mrs. RICHARDS, DO YOU REMEMBER THE NAMES OF ANY OF THE BOYS IN THIS PHOTO WITH DARRELL?
Oh.
DARRELL AND HIS FRIENDS... [ CHUCKLES ]
...and THAT CAR OF HIS.
he WAS 19.
[ voice breaking ] HE -- HE WAS ONLY 19.
I AM SO SORRY, MRS. RICHARDS.
what DO WE KNOW ABOUT MRS. RICHARDS' OTHER SON?
Gabriel: KENYON RICHARDS
is AN INFLUENTIAL COMMUNITY ACTIVIST IN CRENSHAW.
great, ANOTHER COP-HATER.
he's NOT LIKE THAT.
he HAD A TOUGH CHILDHOOD BUT TURNED HIS LIFE AROUND.
in FACT, THE LAST 10 YEARS,
he's DONE A LOT OF WORK WITH THE L.A.P.D.
setting UP AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS.
and I THINK I READ A COUPLE WEEKS AGO
that HE'S RUNNING FOR A CITY COUNCIL SEAT IN CRENSHAW.
he's ONE OF THE GOOD GUYS.
just LIKE FATHER JACK.
you KNOW WHAT YOU NEED TO DO? HEY, YOU TWO.
see IF WE CAN GET KENYON TO COME ON IN HERE AND TALK TO US.
if ANYONE KNOWS ABOUT DARRELL, IT OUGHT TO BE HIS BROTHER.
lieutenant TAO, ANY LUCK FINDING THE MURDER WEAPON?
our COLT WAS A STOLEN WEAPON,
so IT WAS RETURNED TO ITS RIGHTFUL OWNER,
a GUN COLLECTOR NAMED MARQUARDT.
well, GO FIND THIS MR. M-- [ GULPS ]
just GO FIND HIM -- PLEASE.
we NEED THAT GUN BROUGHT IN FOR EVIDENCE.
lieutenant FLYNN...
did WE FIND ANYTHING ABOUT THE PAINT ON THIS TARP?
uh, IT'S WHITE.
anything USEFUL?
no, SORRY, CHIEF.
paint's A DEAD END.
all RIGHT, UM, DETECTIVE DANIELS,
I WANT A FULL CHECK ON FATHER JACK'S COMMUNITY CENTER
who WORKS THERE, WHO VISITS, AND HOW IT'S FUNDED.
detective SANCHEZ, YOU CAN GIVE HER A HAND.
which ONE?
uh, LIEUTENANT PROVENZA, MAY I?
sergeant GABRIEL,
now THAT MRS.RICHARDS HAS GIVEN US THIS NICE PHOTO
and THE NAMES TO GO WITH IT,
see IF Y'ALL CAN LOCATE SOME OF THOSE OTHER BOYS.
we NEED SOMEONE TO TELL US ABOUT DARRELL'S LAST DAYS.
thank YOU!
Hi, MAMA. IT'S ME.
Yeah, FRITZ TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED. HOW'S DADDY?
okay, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I JUST NEED TO TALK TO HIM MYSELF AND GET THIS OVER WITH.
I KNOW, MAMA.
just LET ME TALK TO HIM, AND I'LL DEAL WITH IT.
well...
why DOESN'T HE WANT TO TALK TO ME?
read WHAT LETTER?
daddy WROTE ME A LETTER?
[ dial tone ]
computerized voice: If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again.
um...
chief... POPE WANTS US.
deputy CHIEF JOHNSON, SERGEANT GABRIEL,
this IS KENYON RICHARDS.
I'm VERY, VERY SORRY ABOUT YOUR LOSS.
thank YOU...AND THANK YOU FOR TAKING TIME TO SEE ME.
Oh. UH, I THOUGHT WE CALLED YOU.
actually, MR. RICHARDS PHONED UP AFTER YOU WENT TO SEE HIS MOTHER AND ASKED TO SPEAK WITH US.
pope: EITHER WAY, HERE WE ALL ARE.
have A SEAT.
Mr. RICHARDS, LET ME FIRST OF ALL ASSURE YOU
that WE WILL SPARE NO RESOURCES IN SOLVING THIS CASE.
I CAN TELL.
you PEOPLE ARE COMING ON MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE TOO STRONG.
I ASSUME THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE LACK OF COOPERATION THAT I RECEIVED FROM FATHER JACK.
if HE SEEMED LESS THAN HELPFUL,
it's ONLY BECAUSE HE'S TRYING TO PROTECT ME.
from WHAT?
I JUST LAUNCHED AN ELECTION CAMPAIGN.
can't TALK ABOUT DARRELL WITHOUT BRINGING UP MY PAST.
look, I'VE NEVER TRIED TO DENY WHO I WAS.
I USED DRUGS. I DEALT DRUGS.
I GOT SHOT IN A DRIVE-BY BECAUSE I USED TO BE IN A GANG.
my BROTHER...DISAPPEARED OR WAS MURDERED,
but TO BRING THAT ALL UP FRONT AND CENTER DURING AN ELECTION
means I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT WHO I WAS,
not WHO I'VE BECOME.
now, IF YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT SOLVING MY BROTHER'S MURDER,
I'll HELP YOU IN ANY WAY I CAN.
thank YOU.
but IF THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING ME DOWN
or FATHER JACK
well, IT WOULD BE A SHAME FOR YOU ALL TO UNDERESTIMATE THE BAD FEELINGS TOWARDS THE L.A.P.D. IN NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE MINE.
well, WE'RE NOT PERFECT,
but WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY SINCE THE RIOTS.
well, IT CERTAINLY TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH TO FIND DARRELL,
who NO ONE HERE SEEMED TO CARE ABOUT BEFORE I STARTED TO RUN FOR OFFICE.
and, UH, YOUR HARASSMENT OF FATHER JACK
frankly, THAT HAD BETTER JUST END.
and I SAY THAT MORE FOR YOUR SAKE THAN FOR MINE.
you KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
pope: WE HEAR YOU, SIR.
and, UH, WHILE I MAY NOT ALWAYS AGREE
with FATHER JACK'S METHODS,
I DO HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR HIS COMMITMENT TO POSITIVE CHANGE.
I PROMISE YOU, ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT, WE WILL TREAT THE FATHER, YOUR FAMILY, EVERY ASPECT OF THIS CASE WITH, UH, A LITTLE MORE SENSITIVITY.
thank YOU.
Oh.
What?! WHAT?
Where's THE MAIL FROM YESTERDAY?
your FATHER'S LETTER DIDN'T COME.
where IS THE MAIL?
it's WHERE IT ALWAYS IS.
Where's THAT?
if YOU LOOKED AT YOUR MAIL DAILY,
instead OF ONCE A WEEK,
you WOULDN'T HAVE TO ASK ME.
thank YOU. THANK YOU.
the LAST TIME I GOT A LETTER FROM MY FATHER,
I WAS A FRESHMAN IN COLLEGE,
and I GOT A B-MINUS IN HISTORY.
he SAID I SHOULD THINK ABOUT BECOMING A STEWARDESS.
why DON'T YOU JUST CALL HIM?
I DID CALL HIM.
he WOULDN'T TALK TO ME.
my ENTIRE DAY WAS FILLED WITH FATHERS WHO WOULDN'T TALK TO ME.
hey...
I WORKED WITH FATHER JACK ON THE FBI'S GANG TASK FORCE.
he AND I GOT ALONG. YOU WANT ME TO CALL HIM?
I THOUGHT YOU COULDN'T DO ME ANY MORE FAVORS 'CAUSE YOUR FRIENDS WERE MAKING FUN OF YOU AT THE OFFICE.
I'm JUST TRYING TO HELP.
well, I'M NOT SURE THAT YOUR USING THE PHONE RIGHT NOW
is THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT.
don't TOUCH MY PHONE.
I'm GOING BACK IN THE SHOWER!
I FEEL SICK.
so, DETECTIVE DANIELS, WHAT DID WE FIND OUT ABOUT FATHER JACK AND HIS OPERATIONS?
Oh. SORRY. MORNING.
good MORNING.
good MORNING.
good MORNING!
so, JUST BECAUSE FATHER JACK IS NOT-FOR-PROFIT
doesn't MEAN HE'S NOT MAKING MONEY.
since HE STARTED THE CENTER IN 1990,
he's RAISED ALL OF THE FUNDS HIMSELF.
so, WHERE'S THE MONEY COME FROM?
from A BUNCH OF LITTLE BUSINESSES HE RUNS
a HOUSE-PAINTING COMPANY.
I WONDER IF THEY USE ANY TARPS.
they GOT A SMALL FLEET OF MOVING VANS,
and THERE'S ALSO A LITTLE RECORDING STUDIO
where THEY MAKE DEMO TAPES, STAFFED BY GANG MEMBERS.
ex-gang MEMBERS.
which BRINGS US TO HIS OTHER SOURCE OF FUNDS.
when GANG MEMBERS COME OFF THE STREET,
father JACK ENCOURAGES THEM TO DONATE TO HIS FOUNDATION.
it's PART OF PROVING THEY'RE SERIOUS ABOUT GETTING CLEAN.
Flynn: OH, SO ST.JACK USES DIRTY MONEY
to CLEAN UP THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
Brenda: OKAY, OKAY.
gentlemen, ANY LUCK LOCATING AND IDENTIFYING THE BOYS IN THIS PHOTO?
michael KING -- DEAD.
Alvin HENDERSON -- DEAD.
Ricky BUTLER -- DEAD.
Roy BROWN -- 5 TO 10 ON A DRUG-TRAFFICKING CONVICTION.
we TALKED TO HIM.
and SHAWN JACKSON...
dead.
sergeant?
but THIS GUY HERE IN THE YELLOW, THIS GUY RIGHT HERE,
Terry MILLER
Terry MILLER WE'VE ALREADY SEEN.
do YOU RECOGNIZE ANYONE IN THIS PHOTOGRAPH, TERRY?
Gabriel: TERRY, YOU SEE THAT GUY IN THE BACK,
in THE SKULLCAP -- ROY BROWN?
we WENT AND VISITED HIM IN PRISON,
and HE TOLD US THAT YOU WERE ALL EIGHT-DEUCES
and THAT YOU SOLD DRUGS.
[ laughing ] WE DID A LOT OF THINGS I AIN'T TOO PROUD OF.
sell DRUGS? YEAH, WE SOLD DRUGS.
uh, CRACK, MOSTLY.
but IN 1992, DARRELL LEFT THE GANG?
yeah...
he CHANGED.
father JACK SET HIM STRAIGHT.
Yeah, WELL, IN MY EXPERIENCE,
gangs DON'T TAKE IT LIGHTLY
when ONE OF THEIR MEMBERS DECIDES TO QUIT.
well, DARRELL LEFT TOWN BEFORE WE COULD, UH, DISCUSS IT
or THAT'S WHAT WE THOUGHT AT THE TIME.
when DARRELL DISAPPEARED, HIS FAMILY ASSUMED HE WAS DEAD.
why DO YOU THINK HE LEFT TOWN?
woke UP ONE MORNING, AND 2 KILOS OF MY COCAINE WAS GONE.
now, DARRELL WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO KNEW WHERE I KEPT MY STASH.
I FOUND HIM, AND I GAVE HIM 24 HOURS TO GET IT BACK TO ME.
next THING I KNOW, HE'S GONE, AND MY COKE'S GONE.
so...
I FIGURED DARRELL WANTED TO START OVER SOMEWHERE.
Yeah, WELL, YOU LISTEN TO THIS.
when DID THIS HAPPEN?
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
I MEAN, SOMETIME AROUND THE END OF THE RIOTS.
Hey! THIS MEETING IS OVER!
I WON'T ALLOW YOU TO QUESTION ANYONE FROM MY FOUNDATION WITHOUT AN ATTORNEY!
and IF YOU KEEP HARASSING US,
I HAVE NO PROBLEM GOING OVER YOUR HEAD.
go RIGHT AHEAD, FATHER.
[ sarcastically ] OH, BLESS YOU, LIEUTENANT.
bless YOU, TOO.
all RIGHT, SERGEANT GABRIEL, PLEASE CHECK
all THE EMERGENCY-ROOM RECORDS FOR MAY OF 1992
and BRING ME A LIST
of EVERYONE ADMITTED WITH A BULLET WOUND DURING THAT TIME.
thank YOU.
if DARRELL STOLE THAT MUCH COKE, THERE'S NO WAY THAT TERRY WOULD JUST LET HIM DRIVE AWAY AND DISAPPEAR.
Yeah, BUT HE DIDN'T DRIVE AWAY, DID HE?
he WAS KILLED.
so WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS CAR?
DARRELL'S CAR?
I SOLD IT.
was THAT BEFORE OR AFTER DARRELL DISAPPEARED?
after. WE NEEDED THE EXTRA MONEY.
do YOU REMEMBER WHO YOU SOLD IT TO?
well, WE DIDN'T REALLY SELL THE CAR OURSELVES.
I HAD KENYON TAKE IT TO FATHER JACK TO SELL IT FOR US.
what ARE YOU TWO DOING IN
you FOUND THE GUN. YES.
did YOU TEST-FIRE IT? NO.
I DO NOT HAVE TIME FOR YOU TWO RIGHT NOW.
I JUST SPENT THE WHOLE DAY
looking FOR AN '86 BLUE MONTE CARLO
and ANOTHER HOUR DRAGGING THAT PRIEST IN,
which MEANS THAT HOLY HELL IS ABOUT TO BREAK OUT IN HERE.
so IF Y'ALL WOULDN'T MIND COMING BACK
when YOU ACTUALLY HAVE SOMETHING...
you DIDN'T LET US FINISH.
the GUN SPENT THE LAST 10 YEARS IN A GARAGE WITH DRAINAGE ISSUES.
it SHOULD BE A CRIME TO NEGLECT A REVOLVER LIKE THIS ONE.
the GUN WAS RUSTED OUT. IT WOULDN'T FIRE.
so YOU COULDN'T CONFIRM IT IS THE MURDER WEAPON.
we DON'T NEED THE GUN TO WORK.
all WE NEED ARE THE MARKINGS ON THE BARREL.
that BULLET CAME FROM THIS GUN.
great. THAT'S ALL I NEED TO KNOW RIGHT NOW.
that's GREAT. THANK YOU.
Thanks.
Hello?
it's ME.
Oh, uh, can I call you back?
I've GOT AN ANGRY PRIEST WAITING FOR ME.
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT TO KNOW WHAT CAME IN THE MAIL TODAY.
daddy's LETTER?
Yeah, YOU WANT ME TO OPEN IT?
no.
wait.
Yes. OPEN IT.
no.
wait, um...
shoot! I DON'T KNOW.
you KNOW WHAT? NO.
don't OPEN IT.
I'm GONNA OPEN IT LATER, MAYBE MUCH LATER.
why DID YOU PUT FATHER JACK IN AN INTERVIEW ROOM?
because I WANT TO INTERVIEW HIM.
Kenyon: I THOUGHT WE HAD AN UNDERSTANDING.
was IT REALLY NECESSARY TO MARCH HIM PAST NEWS CAMERAS
and PUT HIM IN A POLICE CAR LIKE A COMMON CRIMINAL?
there's ALREADY A GROUP OUTSIDE PROTESTING HIS ARREST.
well, I DIDN'T ARREST HIM.
pope: GOOD, THEN RELEASE HIM IMMEDIATELY,
find ONE OF THE CAMERAS OUT THERE, AND APOLOGIZE TO IT.
you're NOT GONNA ANSWER THAT, ARE YOU?
Hello? HIYA, CHIEF.
uh, HOLD ON JUST FOR A MINUTE, PLEASE.
I'm SORRY. IT'LL JUST TAKE ONE MINUTE.
pardon ME. EXCUSE ME.
sorry.
Yes, LIEUTENANT?
I THOUGHT YOU COULD TAKE AN INTERRUPTION FOR SOME GOOD NEWS.
we managed to arrange Darrell's car the way you wanted it and just got the last of the hospital reports.
guess WHO CHECKED IN TO COUNTY HOSPITAL WITH A BULLET WOUND ON MAY 5th.
thank YOU, LIEUTENANT.
I APOLOGIZE FOR MY DETECTIVE. SHE CAN BE...
...FRUSTRATING.
she IS A VERY GOOD DETECTIVE, THOUGH,
and MOST OF THE TIME, HER
uh, UH, CHIEF.
what?
Oh, MY GOD!
chief, YOU GOT A SECOND TO
uh, TAYLOR
tell ME WHAT YOU DID WITH DARRELL'S CAR.
I THOUGHT I MADE IT CLEAR THAT I'M NOT ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS.
you DID.
then WHY AM I HERE, MS. JOHNSON?
you HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME
protecting PEOPLE WHO HAVE DONE VERY BAD THINGS.
now THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO STEP UP AND PROTECT YOU.
so, BASICALLY, YOU'RE HOLDING ME HOSTAGE.
well, I LIKE TO THINK OF IT MORE AS...
sanctuary.
excuse ME JUST ONE MINUTE, PLEASE.
I've BEEN VERY PATIENT WITH YOUR CONFRONTATIONAL APPROACH, MS. JOHNSON,
but I'VE HAD ABOUT ENOUGH.
you NEED TO RELEASE FATHER JACK.
or WHAT?
or INSTEAD OF NEGOTIATING QUIETLY IN HERE,
I'll DO IT OUTSIDE WITH THE PROTESTORS AND THE MEDIA.
I DON'T RESPOND WELL TO THREATS, MR.RICHARDS.
no, NO. IT'S FINE, CHIEF POPE.
if MR.RICHARDS WANTS TO NEGOTIATE FOR FATHER JACK'S RELEASE, LET'S NEGOTIATE.
right THIS WAY.
after YOU, SIR.
I'm NOT TRYING TO THREATEN ANYBODY,
but FATHER JACK IS NOT A KILLER.
and IF YOU WANT TO TREAT ME AS HIS LAWYER,
I'll ONLY ADVISE HIM NOT TO ANSWER ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS.
not A "KILLER"?
he WAS THE LAST PERSON IN POSSESSION OF THE MURDER WEAPON.
he SURROUNDS HIMSELF WITH GANGBANGERS AND DRUG DEALERS
and NOW THIS.
you REMEMBER DARRELL'S CAR, THE ONE THAT FATHER JACK SOLD?
the DMV KEEPS EXCELLENT RECORDS, SO WE WERE ABLE TO TRACE THE OWNERSHIP OF DARRELL'S CAR ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE JUNKYARD AND REASSEMBLE THE PIECES.
we're DNA TESTING THE BLOOD THAT WE FOUND IN THE TRUNK,
and I'M CONFIDENT THAT IT WILL MATCH DARRELL'S,
which IS WHY I'D REALLY LIKE TO KNOW
where FATHER JACK WAS 15 YEARS AGO.
in FACT, I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHERE YOU WERE.
excuse ME?
where WERE YOU 15 YEARS AGO?
what ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
this IS A SEARCH WARRANT.
as I'VE ALREADY SAID, I WANT TO BE HELPFUL,
so GO AHEAD -- SEARCH MY OFFICE, SEARCH MY HOUSE.
I DON'T CARE ABOUT WHAT'S IN YOUR HOUSE.
I CARE ABOUT THE BULLET THAT'S IN YOUR LEG.
kenyon RICHARDS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT.
anything YOU SAY CAN AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU IN A COURT OF LAW.
you HAVE THE RIGHT TO AN ATTORNEY.
if YOU CAN'T AFFORD ONE, THE COURT WILL PROVIDE ONE FOR YOU.
have YOU HEARD AND UNDERSTOOD THESE RIGHTS?
Yes, BUT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE -- [ KNOCK ON DOOR ]
pardon ME.
officer. THANK YOU.
lieutenant PROVENZA ALREADY
don't -- DON'T -- DON'T DO THIS.
what?
sergeant, NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO DISCUSS THIS.
kenyon RICHARDS DEVOTES HIS LIFE
to FEEDING AND HELPING PEOPLE,
saving LIVES IN THE POOREST COMMUNITIES IN THIS CITY.
we WILL TALK ABOUT THIS LATER, SERGEANT.
if YOU ARREST HIM,
you WILL BE SENDING A MESSAGE TO EVERY GANGSTER IN TOWN
that THERE'S NO POINT TO CHANGE,
that THEY'RE BEYOND FORGIVENESS,
no MATTER WHO THEY BECOME, THEY WILL ALWAYS BE WHO THEY WERE.
I AM NOT SENDING A MESSAGE. I'M SOLVING A MURDER.
that IS MY JOB.
I THOUGHT OUR JOB WAS TO PROTECT AND SERVE.
who ARE WE PROTECTING BY SENDING HIM TO PRISON?
who ARE WE SERVING?
okay, I DON'T KNOW
who KENYON RICHARDS WAS 15 YEARS AGO,
but THE MAN HE IS TODAY, THE MAN THAT HE HAS BECOME,
does NOT DESERVE THIS.
that IS FOR A JUDGE AND JURY TO DECIDE.
now, IF YOU ARE READY
to SUBSTITUTE YOUR OWN PERSONAL SENSE OF RIGHT AND WRONG
for THE LAW, WHICH IS WHAT WE ARE SWORN TO UPHOLD,
you SHOULD TURN YOUR BADGE IN TODAY.
step ASIDE.
now.
I SAID, STEP ASIDE, SERGEANT.
there's NO WAY I'M LETTING YOU CUT OPEN MY LEG.
that's AN UNREASONABLE SEARCH.
well, I HAVE A JUDGE WHO SAYS OTHERWISE.
because ON MAY 5, 1992, AT 3: 25 A. M.
roughly 36 HOURS BEFORE YOUR MOTHER FILED THAT MISSING-PERSONS REPORT ON YOUR BROTHER,
you WERE ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL WITH A GUNSHOT WOUND.
they CLEANED AND THEY STITCHED THE WOUND,
but THEY DID NOT REMOVE THE BULLET.
they ALSO SAID THAT THE BULLET ENTERED YOUR LEG FROM AN UNUSUAL ANGLE, SUGGESTING THAT YOU WERE SHOT DURING SOME SORT OF CLOSE STRUGGLE.
it's ALL IN THERE.
that DOESN'T PROVE A THING.
this DOES.
this IS THE BULLET THAT WAS LODGED IN YOUR BROTHER'S CHEST.
it RIPPED THROUGH HIS ARMPIT,
went STRAIGHT THROUGH HIS HEART
also INDICATING A CLOSE STRUGGLE.
and I'M CONFIDENT
that BALLISTICS WILL MATCH THIS BULLET
all OF WHICH MEANS THAT ON MAY 5th,
you AND YOUR BROTHER WERE BOTH SHOT BY THE SAME GUN...
...this GUN...
the ONE YOU STRUGGLED OVER.
this IS POLITICAL ASSASSINATION.
I DON'T CARE...
about POLITICS.
I'm MUCH MORE CONCERNED WITH THE FACTS.
facts.
facts CAN BE MANIPULATED.
Yes, THEY CAN,
like WHEN YOU CLAIMED YOU WERE SHOT IN A DRIVE-BY
or WHEN YOU TOLD THE CRENSHAW NEIGHBORHOOD COUNCIL
and I QUOTE
the DEVELOPMENT OF PARCEL 5596
would BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC
and DISPLACE 30 TO 40 LOW-INCOME HOUSES.
you MANIPULATED THE FACTS
to STOP ANYONE FROM UNCOVERING THE BODY OF YOUR BROTHER, WHO YOU SHOT IN THE HEART, WRAPPED IN THIS TARP,
shoved IN THE TRUNK OF HIS CAR,
and BURIED IN AN UNMARKED GRAVE.
you MANIPULATED THE FACTS TO MAKE EVERYONE THINK
that DARRELL'S DISAPPEARANCE CHANGED YOUR LIFE.
no, THAT'S THE TRUTH.
what HAPPENED TO DARRELL TOOK ME TO FATHER JACK,
and I CHANGED.
I DEVOTED MYSELF TO -- TO CARING FOR OTHERS.
every DAY,
I STRUGGLED WITH MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN MY COMMUNITY.
the WORK I'VE DONE, THE WORK I WANT TO DO
I AM DARRELL'S LEGACY.
I've ALREADY SAVED MORE LIVES THAN YOU EVER WILL,
and I CAN SAVE MORE.
I CAN SAVE MORE.
you SAVE LIVES? GREAT.
give ME BACK THE LIFE OF YOUR BROTHER,
and WE WILL CALL IT EVEN.
we DON'T LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE YOU GET TO KILL PEOPLE
and THEN DECIDE HOW TO MAKE UP FOR IT.
now...
you KNOW ABOUT THE MERCY OF GOD, KENYON,
but THE COURTS CAN BE MERCIFUL, TOO.
you WERE A MINOR.
you MADE A MISTAKE.
the JUSTICE SYSTEM WILL TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT.
but FOR MERCY...
the COURTS REQUIRE THE TRUTH.
now, A COMMON CRIMINAL MIGHT LAWYER UP AND FIGHT THIS,
start A RIOT TO PROTECT HIMSELF,
but THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU ARE.
if DARRELL'S DEATH REALLY CHANGED YOU,
now's THE TIME TO TELL THE TRUTH AND SEE HOW PEOPLE TAKE IT.
Darrell, TERRY, AND THOSE GUYS,
back WHEN THEY USED TO DEAL,
I KNEW WHERE THEY KEPT THEIR STASH, SO...
I USED TO STEAL A LITTLE BIT EVERY NOW AND THEN.
I THOUGHT DARRELL NEVER KNEW.
anyway, THE RIOTS WENT OFF,
and, UH, THINGS WERE CRAZY.
people WERE SETTLING SCORES AND STEALING STUFF.
I TOOK A COUPLE BAGS OF COKE FROM TERRY.
anyway...
DARRELL CAME HOME FROM WORK, AND HE KNEW I HAD THE DRUGS,
so HE SNATCHED ME IN THE BACKYARD,
tried TO TAKE THEM FROM ME.
but I WAS HIGH.
he CAME AT ME, AND I HAD A GUN.
he TRIED TO GRAB IT FROM ME.
it WENT OFF, AND IT HIT ME IN THE LEG.
[ voice breaking ] I WAS SO MAD.
I WAS JUST -- I JUST WAS SO MAD. I
I PULLED THE TRIGGER.
I SHOT HIM.
Oh, GOD, I SHOT HIM.
I KILLED MY BROTHER.
he JUST STARED AT ME.
he JUST -- HE JUST STARED AT ME.
I'm SO -- SO SORRY.
I'm SO SORRY.
I'm so sorry.
do YOU
do YOU REALLY THINK THEY'LL FORGIVE ME?
I DO.
and YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
may I GO SPEAK WITH HIM?
of COURSE.
it's RIGHT DOWN THE HALL.
thank YOU.
sure.
hey...
sergeant.
I'm NOT REALLY IN ANY HURRY TO GET HOME.
there's A -- A LETTER WAITING FOR ME
that, UH, I'M NOT SURE I CAN FACE JUST YET.
so I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANTED TO...
talk ABOUT EARLIER.
not PARTICULARLY.
Oh.
so...we OKAY?
I'm FINE.
you NEED ANYTHING, CHIEF?
Oh. NO.
Thanks. UH...
sergeant GABRIEL LEFT, SO I GOT TO BOOK ALL THIS EVIDENCE.
I'll DO THAT.
you KNOW, LIEUTENANT...
may OF 1992, THAT WAS A CHAOTIC TIME.
Yeah.
there WAS RIOTS, AND THERE WAS LOOTERS...
dozens OF MURDERS.
and YOU WERE INVESTIGATING A SHOOTING WITH NO VICTIMS.
there's NOT AN OFFICER ON THIS FORCE
that WOULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING DIFFERENT.
you're RIGHT.
you're RIGHT.
I've GOT A LOT OF REALLY EXCELLENT EXCUSES
for NOT FOLLOWING UP WITH A...
scared KID WHO JUST WANTED TO TURN HIS LIFE AROUND.
but DARRELL RICHARDS IS STILL DEAD.
let ME DO THAT.
my CARD.
my CASE.
Fritz: BRENDA?
Brenda?
you ALL RIGHT?
Yes.
Ahh. YOU FOUND IT.
did YOU OPEN IT?
I CAN'T.
you READ IT.
wait.
wait, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
wait.
[ breathes DEEPLY ] THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.
I've BEEN LYING TO MY DADDY FOR SO LONG, AND I BLAMED YOU.
I'm SO SORRY.
this IS MY FAULT. IT'S JUST -- IT'S ALL MY FAULT.
it's NOT... ALL YOUR FAULT.
I MEAN, MAYBE, I SORT OF...
subconsciously...
answered THAT PHONE ON PURPOSE.
but I MADE YOU DO IT.
can YOU FORGIVE ME?
I FORGIVE YOU, BRENDA...
and SO DOES YOUR FATHER.
y, I JUST NEED TO GET COUPLE OF THINGS OUT OF THERE.
I JUST NEED, LIKE, TWO THINGS.
they're RIGHT THERE. I CAN SEE THEM
they're RIGHT THERE.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY I CAN'T GO OVER.
man: OKAY. I GOT IT.
okay?
what TOOK EVERYBODY SO LONG?!
911 RECEIVED A CALL AROUND 9: 00 P.M.
that SOME GUY WAS GETTING STRANGLED TO DEATH IN THE TOYOTA SECTION OF THE PARKING LOT HERE.
now, YOU GUYS POP IN ABOUT 30 MINUTES AFTER I FIND THE VICTIM'S CAR!
excuse ME, SIR, WHERE IS THE CHIEF?
uh, SHE'S RIGHT OVER THERE.
I'd RECOGNIZE THOSE LEGS ANYWHERE.
Provenza: HEY, SHE'S NOT FEELING WELL!
chief? ARE YOU OKAY?
no. I'M HOT, AND I HAVE A FEVER,
and THE COLD MEDICINE I TOOK IS MAKING ME DIZZY AND NAUSEATED,
and Y'ALL ARE INCREDIBLY LATE.
this IS OFF OF OUR VICTIM, WHO WAS GARROTED FROM BEHIND.
lieutenant PROVENZA HAS THE MURDER WEAPON.
Glen COOPER. 31. NORTH HOLLYWOOD ADDRESS.
business CARD SAYS HE'S A PERSONAL TRAINER.
there's OVER $50 IN HERE.
okay, SO IT'S NOT ROBBERY. SO WHY ARE WE HERE?
Robbery/Homicide RECEIVED FIVE NEW CASES THIS WEEKEND,
so COMMANDER TAYLOR ASKED US TO HELP HIM OUT.
now, IF Y'ALL COULD GET STARTED ON SOMETHING
and ALLOW ME TO TALK TO SERGEANT GABRIEL ALONE FOR A MOMENT, PLEASE?
so, YOU'RE MAD AT ME, IS THAT IT?
no. I'M -- I'M CONFUSED.
I CALLED YOU AND NOBODY ANSWERED.
do YOU SEE WHAT I'M WEARING HERE?
or DID YOU NOT READ THE SCHEDULE I GAVE YOU THIS MORNING?
Where'd YOU PUT IT?
in YOUR HAND.
well, WHAT WAS IT? WHAT'D IT SAY?
it SAID THAT WE WERE COMPLETING WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION TRAINING TONIGHT,
that OUR DIVISION DEADLINE IS FRIDAY THE 26th,
two DAYS FROM NOW.
so THAT'S ALL FINISHED, THEN?
no. NO, WE'RE NOT FINISHED.
we WERE 17 MINUTES SHORT OF FINISHING WHEN YOU APPARENTLY DEMANDED THAT WE BE SENT TO YOU.
now THE WHOLE SQUAD HAS TO START THE TRAINING OVER AGAIN FROM THE BEGINNING.
why IS THIS EVEN NECESSARY?
because THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GIVES US A SUBSIDY FOR EACH PERSON THAT COMPLETES THE TRAINING.
so IT'S POPE'S BUDGET STUFF?
Yes, IT IS.
shouldn't YOU BE IN BED? NO.
I SHOULD BE HAVING A WORD WITH THE VALET.
Kenny: I-I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.
I'm IN AND OUT OF CARS ALL NIGHT,
and I WAS -- I WAS IN ONE WHEN I PULLED AROUND,
and THE OFFICER,
he -- HE TOLD ME THAT SOME GUY GOT KILLED OVER THERE,
and THAT, WELL, NO CARS COULD GO OUT, AND THAT'S NOT GOOD.
I MEAN, LOOK -- LOOK AT HOW MANY ANGRY CUSTOMERS.
my UNCLE, HE'S GONNA BE REALLY UPSET.
your UNCLE?
Yeah. HE OWNS THE LOT.
I NEED TO EITHER BRING PEOPLE THEIR CARS
or GIVE THEM THEIR KEYS BACK.
what IS HE DOING? IS THAT HOW IT'S DONE HERE?
you PARK PEOPLE'S CARS,
and THEN BRING THEM BACK OR GIVE THEM THEIR KEYS?
according TO THE PLANT OF THE VEHICLE.
What?! THAT -- THAT'S MINE.
the VICTIM'S KEYS WERE BY HIS BODY.
he WAS WALKING TO HIS CAR
when SOMEONE PUT A RAZOR WIRE AROUND HIS NECK
and SAWED THROUGH HIS JUGULAR.
and YOU SAW NOTHING?
no, NO. I'M SORRY.
I MUST HAVE BEEN LOOKING THE OTHER WAY OR SOMETHING.
Dr. MORALES, I AM SO SORRY I'M LATE.
I WASN'T FEELING WELL.
Oh, HI, TERRENCE.
sorry TO HEAR YOU'RE SICK. YOU WANT ME TO CHECK YOU OUT?
sorry. THAT DIDN'T SOUND RIGHT.
actually, DOCTOR, I AM FEELING A LITTLE WEIRD,
a-and THE COLD MEDICINE I TOOK
seems TO BE MAKIN' MY HEART RACE. IS THAT NORMAL?
okay, FIRST, STAY OVER THERE, 'CAUSE WHATEVER YOU HAVE, I DON'T WANT IT.
sorry.
you WANT TO KNOW MY SYMPTOMS? DO YOU HAVE INSURANCE?
Yes, I DO. THEN SEE YOUR OWN DOCTOR.
if YOU END UP DYING, I PROMISE TO FIND OUT WHY.
may I SEE YOU FOR A MOMENT, PLEASE?
well, I'M JUST ABOUT TO HEAD INTO AN EXAMINATION.
let ME REPHRASE THAT RHETORICAL QUESTION.
I WANT TO SPEAK WITH YOU...NOW.
sergeant GABRIEL JUST INFORMED ME
you PULLED YOUR SQUAD OUT OF WMD TRAINING.
that's RIGHT, BECAUSE MURDER TAKES PRECEDENT OVER PEOPLE WALKING AROUND IN HAZMAT SUITS.
we SERIOUSLY NEED THE MONEY THE FEDS GIVE US
for BRINGING YOUR SQUAD INTO WMD COMPLIANCE.
and I SERIOUSLY NEED TO FIND SOMEONE
who GARROTES PEOPLE IN PARKING LOTS.
which IS MORE IMPORTANT?
besides, YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
that MY TEAM ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE
where THOSSTUPID HAZMAT SUITS ARE NECESSARY.
priority HOMICIDE MUST BE BROUGHT UP TO WMD QUALIFICATION.
there IS NO WAY AROUND THAT,
so I'VE RESCHEDULED THE TRAINING FOR TOMORROW.
tomorrow? YEAH.
what IF I DON'T SOLVE THE MURDER BY THEN? NO. NO WAY.
or YOU CAN LOSE ONE MEMBER OF YOUR SQUAD PERMANENTLY TO COUNTERTERRORISM.
why DO YOU KEEP THREATENING ME WITH THAT?
and WHEN I'M SICK, TOO.
she's A LITTLE SPITFIRE, ISN'T SHE?
the GARROTE KILLED HIM,
but THESE MARKS ON HIS BACK LOOK TO BE FROM A TASER.
someone ZAPPED YOUR VIC TO TAKE THE FIGHT OUT OF HIM.
not A BAD PLAN. BUFF GUY HERE.
also, MR. COOPER HAD DINNER LESS THAN AN HOUR BEFORE HE WAS KILLED,
maybe AT AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT.
looks LIKE PUMPKIN RAVIOLI.
I DON'T OFTEN FIND IT THIS TIME OF YEAR.
some RISOTTO, LOTS OF BREAD.
you SURE THIS GUY WAS A FITNESS INSTRUCTOR?
that's AN AWFUL LOT OF CARBS.
also LOOKS LIKE HE HAD AT LEAST A HALF A BOTTLE OF RED WINE
and A DOZEN RAW OYSTERS.
sounds ROMANTIC, DOESN'T IT?
Cooper's CREDIT CARDS ARE MAXED OUT,
so HE DIDN'T CHARGE ANYTHING THE NIGHT HE WAS KILLED.
but HERE'S SOMETHING INTERESTING.
up UNTIL LAST WEEK,
he MADE DAILY WITHDRAWALS OF $500
the MAXIMUM ALLOWED WITH HIS ATM CARD.
according TO MY MATH, THAT'S ALMOST $20, 000 IN CASH.
why WOULD HE NEED THAT MUCH MONEY?
blackmail. EXPENSIVE DRUG HABIT.
any INFORMATION ON OUR 911 CALL?
a RECORDING'S ON THE WAY.
the OWNER OF THE PHONE, WHO DENIES MAKING THE CALL,
says THAT HE WAS AT A NEARBY RESTAURANT HAVING DINNER AT THE TIME OF THE MURDER.
three ITALIAN RESTAURANTS IN THE VICINITY OF WHERE MR. MUSCLES WAS FOUND.
two SERVE RAW OYSTERS, BUT ONLY ONE, IL PRIMO,
had PUMPKIN RAVIOLI ON THE MENU LAST NIGHT -- A SPECIAL.
and A WAITER RECOGNIZED OUR VICTIM FROM HIS DMV PHOTO.
said HE HAD A HOT BLONDE WITH HIM, AND THE BABE PAID.
please, PLEASE HOLD YOUR APPLAUSE.
Ta-da!
a COPY OF THE HOT BLONDE'S CREDIT-CARD RECEIPT.
thank YOU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
and THE NAME ON THE CREDIT CARD?
Tiffany LEWIS? YES?
I'm DEPUTY CHIEF BRENDA LEIGH JOHNSON, L.A. P.D.
and THIS IS SERGEANT DAVID GABRIEL.
Oh, PAYBACK FROM WHEN I SENT SUSAN THE FIREMAN STRIPPER.
is THAT IT?
actually, MRS. LEWIS,
we're HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT GLEN COOPER.
did YOU TELL MARIA TO PUT THE VODKA IN THE FREEZER?
excuse ME. WHAT IS IT, HONEY?
did YOU TELL MARIA TO PUT THE VODKA IN THE FREEZER?
I DID, BOB. AREN'T I A GOOD GIRL?
who ARE THEY?
um...
Mormons.
remember, WE'RE GOING OUT TO DINNER TONIGHT.
I KNOW. VERY EXCITING.
so, I take it that the oysters and red wine that you had at Il Primo were not with your husband?
I can't talk about this right now.
can you maybe just go away?
sure. As long as you promise to come downtown to my office in, say, two hours.
we can continue this in a more private setting.
I'm kind of busy right now.
or I can come back. It's your choice.
Oh.
what am I supposed to tell my husband about where I'm going?
whatever you usually tell him, Mrs. Lewis.
what NOW, MR. HOWARD?
I'm SORRY TO BOTHER YOU AGAIN.
I NEED ANOTHER E.T.A. ON WHEN YOU THINK THE DOCTOR MIGHT BE READY TO SEE MS.JOHNSON.
ANY...MOMENT.
just A LITTLE MORE PATIENCE, PLEASE, OKAY?
really SOON.
we HAVE BEEN WAITING 45 MINUTES.
th's WHY THEY CALL IT A WAITING ROOM.
deputy CHIEF JOHNSON.
Yes, SERGEANT.
Oh.
all RIGHT. I'LL BE THERE AS SOON AS I CAN.
Bye.
Brenda, WAIT.
Hey, HEY.
you're SICK.
I'm FEELIN' FINE NOW, AND I ONLY HAVE 24 HOURS
to FINISH THIS CASE BEFORE MY SQUAD HAS TO PLAY WAR GAMES,
and, HONESTLY, IT IS JUST A LITTLE COLD.
you DON'T HAVE A RUNNY NOSE. YOU DON'T HAVE A COUGH.
look, JUST DON'T WORRY.
if I GET ANOTHER FEVER, WE'LL -- WE'LL SEE.
I'll SEE YOU AT HOME.
sir. SIR, YOU CAN'T GO BACK THERE!
uh, CHIEF, TIFFANY LEWIS' CREDIT-CARD STATEMENTS.
I FAXED GLEN COOPER'S PICTURE
to THE OTHER RESTAURANTS WHERE THEY ATE,
and LAST NIGHT'S MEAL WASN'T THEIR FIRST DINNER FOR TWO.
Plus, THERE ARE SEVERAL FIVE-STAR HOTEL CHARGES,
all HERE IN TOWN.
well, THANK YOU.
all RIGHT, THEN, MRS. LEWIS.
okay, I ADMIT IT.
you ADMIT TO WHAT, EXACTLY?
I'm HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH GLEN.
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE,
but I DIDN'T KNOW THAT IT WAS ILLEGAL IN CALIFORNIA.
honestly, I THINK THAT I'M BEING PICKED ON FOR SOME REASON.
Oh, MRS. LEWIS,
it ISN'T AGAINST THE LAW TO, UH, HAVE AN AFFAIR.
Really?
really.
Oh, MY GOD, YOU DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GUYS JUST SCARED ME.
I ALMOST PEED A LITTLE.
you're NOT GONNA TELL MY HUSBAND, ARE YOU?
I MEAN, HE HAS A TEMPER,
and I DIDN'T MEAN TO START HAVING AN AFFAIR.
it JUST HAPPENED.
and THEN IT KEPT HAPPENING.
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE GUYS
just WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH ME, DAMN IT.
as LONG AS YOU COMPLETELY COOPERATE,
I SEE NO REASON TO INFORM YOUR HUSBAND.
thank GOD.
our PRENUP'S REALLY BAD FOR ME.
Gabriel: WHEN YOU AND MR. COOPER
were LEAVING THE RESTAURANT LAST NIGHT,
did YOU NOTICE ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS?
Oh, I WOULDN'T KNOW. LET ME THINK.
we LEFT THE RESTAURANT, HE WALKED ME TO MY CAR,
he KISSED ME GOOD NIGHT, AND I WENT HOME.
seems NORMAL.
you DIDN'T VALET YOUR CAR?
last TIME I VALETED MY CAR, THE ATTENDANT GUY STOLE MY POT,
so I DON'T VALET ANYMORE.
are YOU SURE YOUR HUSBAND DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT YOUR AFFAIR?
Oh, NO.
if HE KNEW THAT GLEN AND I WERE SCREWIN' AROUND,
Bob WOULD BE JUST FURIOUS.
why ARE YOU SO INTERESTED IN ALL OF THIS?
well, I'M SORRY TO TELL YOU THIS, TIFFANY,
but, UM, LAST NIGHT, GLEN COOPER WAS MURDERED
in A PARKING LOT OUTSIDE THE RESTAURANT WHERE
murdered?
you MEAN LIKE... SOMEBODY KILLED HIM?
Yes. I'M SO SORRY.
no, THERE -- THERE MUST BE A MISTAKE.
that's WRONG!
we're VERY SORRY, MRS. LEWIS.
Oh. OH, MY GOD
Oh, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD!
Oh, NO!
Oh, MY GOD!
Oh, NO.
chief, WE GOT CONFIRMATION THAT, DURING THE MURDER,
when THE 911 CALL WAS MADE, THE OWNER OF THIS CELLPHONE
was SITTING AT THE CHEF'S TABLE OF CHEZ BOHEMIA.
he CLAIMS HIS CELLPHONE WAS IN HIS CAR
the SAME LOT WHERE THE BODY WAS FOUND.
only ONE OTHER PERSON HAD ACCESS TO THAT PHONE DURING THE TIME OF THE MURDER.
our VALET PARKER, KENNY WOODS.
I JUST DUMPED HIM IN THE INTERVIEW ROOM WITH PROVENZA.
so, WHAT'D I MISS?
hot, MARRIED GIRLFRIEND OF THE VICTIM NAMED TIFFANY.
I THINK SHE WANTED ME.
thank YOU, DETECTIVE SANCHEZ, FOR KEEPING US UP TO DATE.
perhaps YOU CAN FIND OUT WHERE TIFFANY'S HUSBAND WAS LAST NIGHT AND WHAT HE WAS DOING DURING THE TIME OF THE MURDER?
more ABOUT MR. WOODS, PLEASE.
okay, I SPOKE TO MR. LANG,
the OWNER OF THE PARKING LOT WHERE KENNY WORKS,
and WHEN I ASKED HIM ABOUT THE TOYOTA SECTION, WHICH IS WHERE THE 911 CALLER SAID SOMEONE WAS BEING MURDERED,
Mr. LANG LAUGHED.
he SAID THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS A TOYOTA SECTION
is HIS NEPHEW KENNY.
he ALSO SAYS THAT KENNY HAS OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER,
which IS A FANCY WAY OF SAYING HE'S A CONTROL FREAK.
now, HE TAKES SOME MEDICATION FOR IT.
I COULD FIND OUT THE NAME IF YOU'D LIKE.
no, THANKS, LIEUTENANT.
does MR. WOODS
have A PREVIOUS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE L.A.P.D?
seems OUR VALET DOESN'T LIKE IT
when PEOPLE PULL OUT OF HIS PARKING LOT THE WRONG WAY,
whatever THE HELL THAT MEANS.
L.A.P.D. PICKED HIM UP FOR TWO LITTLE DUST-UPS WITH SOME CUSTOMERS.
and OUR LITTLE WEIRDO IS STICKING TO HIS STORY.
well, THEN, I'LL HAVE TO MAKE HIS STAY HERE VERY WELCOMING, THEN, WON'T I?
thank YOU, LIEUTENANT.
woman: 911, WHAT IS YOUR EMERGENCY?
man: I JUST SAW SOME-BODY STRANGLE SOMEBODY IN THE THE TOYOTA SECTION OF THE PARKING LOT.
and WHAT IS YOUR LOCATION, SIR?
Lang's VALET, E-EAST OF GRAND.
emergency VEHICLES ARE ON
there ARE MORE THAN A FEW SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THIS CALLER AND YOU, KENNY.
he REPORTS A MAN BEING MURDERED IN THE TOYOTA SECTION OF YOUR PARKING LOT,
and YOU MADE THE CALL ON THIS CELLPHONE, WHICH HAPPENED TO BE LOCKED IN ONE OF THE CARS YOU VALETED.
I -- I-I DIDN'T -- I DIDN'T MAKE ANY CALL.
the CALLER ALSO STAMMERS.
I...
I DIDN'T MAKE ANY CALL.
these ARE THE FINGERPRINTS THAT WERE FOUND ON THE CELLPHONE THAT MADE THE 911 CALL.
and THESE ARE YOUR FINGERPRINT THEY MATCH.
maybe THE PHONE WAS ON THE SEAT AND I MOVED IT.
Ah, YOU'VE GOT A BIT OF A TEMPER, DON'T YOU, KENNY BOY?
rap SHEET SAYS HERE THAT YOU'VE BEEN PICKED UP TWICE
for SOME PRETTY NASTY ARGUMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS.
I DO NOT HAVE A-A-A TEMPER!
it's JUST THERE'S A CERTAIN WAY THAT CARS NEED TO BE PUT IN AND BROUGHT OUT,
and OTHER PEOPLE, THEY DON'T ALWAYS UNDERSTAND
the CHALLENGES OF VALET PARKING!
did THE MAN WHO HAD HIS THROAT CUT IN YOUR LOT LAST NIGHT
not UNDERSTAND THOSE CHALLENGES?
did YOU TWO ARGUE?
what? NO!
seriously, WHY -- WHY WOULD YOU THINK SUCH THINGS ABOUT ME?
because YOU'RE NOT TELLIN' ME THE TRUTH, KENNY!
and I HAVE TO CONSIDER WHY,
and ONE POSSIBILITY IS THAT YOU KILLED MR. COOPER
because HE INTERFERED WITH THE WAY YOU RAN THE LOT.
I MADE THE CALL, OKAY?
but I DIDN'T -- I DIDN'T KILL HIM!
I'm NOT SAYING ANYTHING ELSE UNTIL AFTER I FLOSS.
I-I CAN'T -- I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING ELSE.
I NEED TO -- I NEED TO BRUSH MY TEETH AND FLOSS.
why CAN'T YOU SAY ANYTHING ELSE? YOU MADE THE CALL.
you SAW GLEN COOPER DIE. DID YOU SEE THE KILLER, TOO?
were YOU THREATENED IN SOME WAY? NO.
Mr. COOPER WAS ATTACKED,
so YOU GRABBED A SET OF KEYS AND YOU LOCKED YOURSELF IN A CAR.
and THE KILLER THREATENED YOU AS YOU DROVE AWAY.
is THAT IT? CAN YOU IDENTIFY HIM?
no.
no, NO, NO.
I'm -- I'M SORRY.
can I JUST -- JUST PARK CARS?
the ANSWER TO THAT, KENNY, IS YES.
okay.
I CAN'T COMPEL YOU TO TELL ME ANYTHING.
just REMEMBER ONE THING
killers DON'T LIKE LEAVING EYEWITNESSES AROUND,
especially ONES WHO'VE BEEN TALKING TO THE POLICE.
so YOU BE CAREFUL IN YOUR PARKING LOT TONIGHT.
wait.
don't YOU HAVE TO PROTECT ME?
from WHO? FROM THAT GUY!
so WE'RE LOOKING FOR A MAN? WHAT DID HE LOOK LIKE, KENNY?
how BIG WAS HE? HOW OLD?
no, NO, NO, NO, NO.
no.
he WILL KILL ME IF I TALK. OH, MY GOD.
Oh! OH.
look, UM...
I THINK -- I THINK I'D RATHER JUST STAY HERE TONIGHT.
please.
I'll SEE IF I CAN PULL SOME STRINGS.
Oh.
Oh, MY GOD.
thank YOU.
I KNOW I SHOULD'VE RESCHEDULED WITH THE DOCTOR,
but I THINK I FIGURED OUT WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.
palpitations, FEVER, FEELING FAINT
you HAVE A DIAGNOSIS THAT COVERS ALL THAT?
cold MEDICINE PLUS STRESS.
okay.
lowering YOUR PRESSURE AT WORK COULDN'T HURT,
but YOU STILL HAVE TO SEE A DOCTOR
because I DON'T THINK STRESS CAUSES FEVERS.
that's FROM THE COLD, WHICH IS ON ITS WAY OUT.
I CAN TELL.
so...
let's TALK ABOUT THE ANXIETY.
you DEAL WITH MURDERS ALL THE TIME,
and IT DOESN'T USUALLY GET YOU THIS STRESSED OUT,
so...what's UP?
budget ISSUES.
Pope's MAKIN' -- HE'S MAKIN' MY SQUAD
go THROUGH WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION TRAINING
for SOME FEDERAL SUBSIDIES.
eight HOURS IN THOSE RIDICULOUS HAZMAT SUITS.
startin' TOMORROW, THEY'RE ALL GONNA BE RUNNIN' AROUND SOME POTENTIAL TERRORIST TARGET,
leavin' ME TO SOLVE THIS MURDER COMPLETELY ON MY OWN...
with PROVENZA, WHO I GUESS IS TOO OLD FOR WMD.
it's JUST
you SEE HOW UPSETTIN' THAT IS? DO YOU SEE IT?
right. OKAY.
you KNOW, I THINK I KNOW A WAY YOU CAN WORK THE MURDER AND KEEP YOUR WHOLE TEAM ALL IN THE SAME PLACE.
the FLOOR OF THIS BUILDING
is NOT A PROPER PLACE FOR WMD TRAINING.
Oh, WELL, ACCORDING TO YOUR QUALIFICATION MANUAL,
which IS WHAT I'M GOING BY, "ANY EMERGENCY TRAINING TO BE COMPLETED BY SAID GROUP "MAY BE CONDUCTED IN ANY AND ALL GOVERNMENT-OWNED "AND OPERATED VENUES, NOT EXCLUDING THOSE
which MIGHT THEMSELVES BE TARGETS IN A TERRORIST ATTACK.
that SOUNDS LIKE PARKER CENTER TO ME.
you're DELIBERATELY MISINTERPRETING THE TEXT.
just SO YOU KNOW, FOR THE NEXT 7 HOURS AND 38 MINUTES,
this SQUAD IS MINE.
that HEADGEAR COMES OFF, IF I SEE ONE PERSON'S FACE,
even A FINGERNAIL, NO QUALIFICATION.
and AT SOME POINT, WE HAVE TO RESCUE SOMEONE.
I'll LEAVE WHEN UP TO YOU.
chief, DON'T WORRY.
I'm GONNA TAKE THE LEAD HERE. WE'RE GOOD.
Mr. COX, I AM HAPPY TO HELP YOU IN ANY WAY I CAN.
I COULD DO THAT MORE EFFECTIVELY IF I COULD TALK TO MY SQUAD.
Oh. USE THIS. THEY'RE ON CHANNEL 4.
really, MAKING ME USE THAT RADIO SYSTEM -- IT COMPLICATES MY JOB.
and WHAT ABOUT MY JOB?!
which IS TO ENSURE THIS SQUAD KNOWS WHAT MEASURES TO TAKE
in THE EVENT OF, SAY -- I DON'T KNOW -- A NUCLEAR DISASTER.
sir, THIS IS A HOMICIDE DIVISION, NOT A BOMB SQUAD.
well, ACCORDING TO THE PAPERWORK I HAVE, IT'S BOTH.
what PAPERWORK?
what IS HE TALKING
what IS HE TALKING ABOUT?!
what IS HE TALKING ABOUT?
we just need to finish training.
[ shouting ] Chief! I checked into Tiffany
detective SANCHEZ, USE YOUR INSIDE VOICE, PLEASE.
[ softly ] Sorry.
I checked into Tiffany's husband, Bob.
the night before last, he has an alibi -- out to dinner.
and I looked into his finances.
he's an efficiency expert with a highly successful consulting firm.
and his prenup with Tiffany -- watertight.
I did a phone du on Lewis' landlines and cellphones
calls from Mrs. Lewis to Glen Cooper, but nothing out of the ordinary like private detectives or divorce attorneys.
if TIFFANY CHARGED HER AFFAIR ON THEIR JOINT CREDIT CARDS,
it's ALL OVER THEIR STATEMENTS.
lieutenant TAO, COULD YOU PLEASE CHECK MR. LEWIS' OFFICE LINES?
thank YOU.
and, UH, LIEUTENANT PROVENZA -- YEAH.
lieutenant PROVENZA, HOW'S OUR PARKING ATTENDANT DOING?
Oh, HE'S STILL HERE.
ROBBERY/HOMICIDE'S WATCHING HIM FOR US.
look, ALIBI OR NOT
alibi OR NOT,
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD HAVE MR. LEWIS,
Tiffany's HUSBAND, POP IN FOR A VISIT.
but I CAN'T SEND ANY OF YOU TO GO PICK HIM UP,
and I CAN'T SEND LIEUTENANT PROVENZA BY HIMSELF.
Oh, THIS IS A NIGHTMARE!
sergeant GABRIEL, WHAT DID MR. COX MEAN EN HE SAYS, ACCORDING TO HIS PAPERWORK, Y'ALL ARE PRIORITY HOMICIDE AND A BOMB SQUAD?
okay. Chief, now, don't get mad.
my ENTIRE DIVISION IS OFFICIALLY PART OF THE L.A.P.D.'s COUNTERTERRORISM BUREAU?
well, NOT PROVENZA.
when WERE YOU GONNA TELL ME ABOUT THIS?
look, I-IT'S ONLY A PAPER CHANGE.
it's SO MINOR, I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D NOTICE.
there ARE FIVE PEOPLE WALKIN' AROUND MY MURDER ROOM IN NOISY, PLASTIC SUITS.
how COULD I NOT NOTICE?
you KNOW, HONESTLY, WHEN SERGEANT GABRIEL
came UP WITH THE IDEA FOR THESE TRANSFERS
to SAVE YOUR SECTION FROM BUDGET CUTS, BY THE WAY,
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE HAPPY -- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'm DIZZY, AND MY HEART'S POUNDING.
it ONLY HAPPENS WHEN I GET REALLY, REALLY MAD.
I THOUGHT IT WAS A REACTION TO MY COLD MEDICINE.
did WE ESTABLISH THAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A COLD?
I've BEEN GETTIN' FEVERS. I DON'T KNOW.
have YOU CONSIDERED SEEING A DOCTOR?
and WHEN DO I HAVE TIME TO DO THAT, WILL?
if LIEUTENANT PROVENZA AND I
are THE ENTIRE PRIORITY HOMICIDE DIVISION
and I HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING MYSELF WITHOUT ANY HELP FROM ANYBODY AND BUDGET CUTS
don't OVERREACT. AND I'M NOT OVERREACTING!
uh, EXCUSE ME. IS THIS A BAD TIME?
no, CHIEF JOHNSON WAS JUST LEAVING.
actually, IT WAS HER WHO I CAME TO SPEAK TO.
I've BEEN WATCHING THIS KENNY, YOUR VALET GUY.
we JUST PULLED IN THIS BOB LEWIS CHARACTER,
who SERGEANT GABRIEL ASKED ME TO PICK UP.
I WAS WONDERING WHAT YOU WANT US TO DO WITH THE TWO OF THEM.
thank YOU, COMMANDER, FOR ALL YOUR HELP.
if YOU COULD PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT KENNY WOODS
makes IT INTO THE ELECTRONICS ROOM WITH LIEUTENANT PROVENZA
and SET UP MR. LEWIS IN ONE OF OUR INTERVIEW ROOMS,
that WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL.
excuse ME.
why AM I HERE?
do I NEED TO HAVE MY LAWYER MEET ME?
well, UM, IF YOU REALLY THINK
that WAITIN' FOR LEGAL REPRESENTATION'S
the BEST USE OF YOUR TIME, MR. LEWIS,
we COULD CERTAINLY DO THAT,
but KNOWIN' THAT, UH, YOU'RE AN EFFICIENCY EXPERT,
I WROTE DOWN ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT I WANTED TO ASK YOU.
I THOUGHT MAYBE THAT YOU COULD LOOK THEM OVER ???????
let's JUST GET THIS OVER WITH.
um...
where WERE...
UH,"WHERE WERE YOU THE NIGHT BEFORE LAST"?
that's WEDNESDAY, THE 24th.
business DINNER AT MASTRO'S.
you WANT FURTHER DETAILS,
I'll HAVE MY ASSISTANT E-MAIL YOU, OKAY?
do YOU...
harm THE WAR?
yore KIDDING, RIGHT?
do YOU KNOW THIS MAN?
what MAN?
Oh, SORRY.
um...
here.
this MAN.
Oh, YEAH, THAT'S MY WIFE'S FITNESS TRAINER,
Jeff OR CHUCK OR SOMETHING.
actually, HIS NAME IS GLEN COOPER.
Oh. THAT'S RIGHT. GLEN.
and HE WAS FOUND DEAD THE NIGHT OF THE 24th OUTSIDE IL PRIMO, A RESTAURANT DOWNTOWN.
Mm-hmm. THAT'S TOO BAD.
Tiffany WAS REALLY, UH, TIGHTENING UP HER STOMACH.
uh...
what IS THIS LAST QUESTION?
do YOU KNOW ABOUT THE AFFECT?
affair?
that's SERIOUSLY SUPPOSED TO BE AN "R"?
that IS ILLEGIBLE.
wait A MINUTE. WHAT AFFAIR?
you RECOGNIZE HIM? IS THIS THE GUY?
the ONLY WAY WE CAN KEEP YOU SAFE, KENNY,
is IF YOU HELP US CATCH THE KILLER.
so IS THIS THE GUY OR NOT?
no.
no, IT'S -- THAT'S -- THAT'S NOT HIM.
do YOU THINK SOMEONE COULD SWING BY MY HOUSE
and GET MY ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH?
I-I-I'm SUOSED TO USE IT TWO MINUTES IN THE MORNING,
two MINUTES AT NIGHT.
also FLOSS -- MINT, WAXED.
you CAN GET THAT AT ANY DRUGSTORE.
Yeah, I'LL GET RIGHT ON THAT.
you DIDN'T NOTICE ALL THESE CHARGES ON YOUR CREDIT CARDS?
I HAVE A BUSINESS MANAGER WHO TAKES CARE OF THE BILLS.
I HIRE A LOT OF PEOPLE TO DO A LOT OF THINGS.
well, I HOPE SHE GOT HER MONEY'S WORTH.
so, ARE WE DONE HERE? YES, SIR.
uh, CHIEF, I LOOKED INTO THOSE
chief, I am s
I am so sorry that you had to find out about this transfer this way.
we've -- everyone -- We all thought Chief Pope had already told you about his -- his decision.
chief POPE'S DECISION?
sergeant, EVEN WITH YOUR FACE COVERED UP
and YOUR VOICE DISTORTED BY THAT STUPID MASK,
you ARE STILL A TERRIBLE LIAR.
now, SE CASE.
I LOOKED INTO LEWIS' STORY, AND, IN FACT,
he WAS AT MASTAVING DINNER AT THE TIME OF THE MURDER.
that's NO SURPRISE. HE DOESN'T STRIKE ME AS THE TYPE OF GUY WHO COULD BRING DOWN SOMEONE LIKE MR. COOPER.
well, A TASER COULD EVEN THINGS OUT.
Yeah, but does he
does he seem like the type of guy that owns a taser?
no, BUT
no, BUT HE SEEMS LIKE THE KIND OF GUY
who WOULD HIRE SOMEONE WHO OWNS A TASER.
we STILL NEED A RESCUE OF SOME KIND, AND I'M NOT PLANNING IT.
as SOON AS I'M DONE WITH THIS MURDER, I'LL GET RIGHT ON THAT.
great, AND REMEMBER, THESE PEOPLE NEED TO DEMONSTRATE
they CAN SAVE SOMEONE FROM, ONE -- A LIFE-THREATENING ATTACK,
two -- A RIOT, OR THREE -- A NATURAL CATASTROPHE.
I'll LEAVE IT TO YOU TO DECIDE HOW THAT'S DONE.
you HAVE THREE HOURS AND SIX MINUTES LEFT.
lieutenant TAO
lieutenant TAO, I NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
with THE LEWIS' PHONES AND COMPUTERS, PLEASE.
okay. Starting from the beginning
no, NO, NO, NO. THE END.
quick. LIKE A BUNNY.
last Tuesday, a call was placed from Bob Lewis' office to the cellphone of an Eric Ellis.
now, Eric Ellis is not one of our finest citizens.
Ellis HAS A RECORD -- FEW B&Es, COUPLE OF ASSAULTS,
presently UNEMPLOYED, WHICH MAKES THE $10, 000 DEPOSITED INTO HIS BANK ACCOUNT ON THE 22nd SO INTERESTING.
could BE PAYMENT FOR A HIT.
which IS WHY TAYLOR'S GUYS PULLED HIM IN FOR US.
here's ELLIS' RECORD WITH HIS BOOKING PHOTO FOR HANDY REFERENCE.
thank YOU, LIEUTENANT.
Oh!
Oh, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE, SIT DOWN.
Mr. ELLIS, I NEED TO SPEAK TO YOU
about WHERE YOU WERE AT 9: 00 LAST WEDNESDAY, THE 24th.
you MEAN WEDNESDAY THE 25th.
no, I MEAN WEDNESDAY THE 24th, TWO NIGHTS AGO.
well, I THINK I WAS AT THE GYM ON THE 25th.
it's THE 24th, SIR.
and CAN ANYONE SUBSTANTIATE THAT?
Oh, YOU MEAN AN ALIBI, RIGHT?
Yeah, PEOPLE SAW ME WEDNESDAY NIGHT.
would ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE HAPPEN TO HAVE BEEN MR. BOB LEWIS?
uh, NEVER HEARD OF NO ONE BY THE NAME OF BOB LEWIS...
ever.
Really? WELL, MR. LEWIS' PHONE RECORDS INDICATE OTHERWISE,
and WHEN I SPOKE TO HIM EARLIER
about THE MURDER OF GLEN COOPER
you SPOKE TO MR. LEWIS ABOUT A MURDERER?
Yes.
so, MR. LEWIS ISN'T DEAD?
now YOU'VE GOT IT.
so, WHO GOT KILLED?
Mr. LEWIS' WIFE'S BOYFRIEND.
on WEDNESDAY THE 25th?
it's WEDNESDAY THE 24th!
can I SEE A CALENDAR?
Oh.
can YOU EXPLAIN THAT WHOLE LAWYER THING TO ME AGAIN?
Oh!
you SAID YOU WEREN'T GONNA TELL MY HUSBAND ABOUT THE AFFAIR.
uh, IT WAS UNAVOIDABLE. I'M SORRY.
what AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
I TOLD YOU ABOUT BOB'S TEMPER.
why DON'T YOU STAY HERE FOR A WHILE
until WE'RE ABLE TO DEAL WITH YOUR HUSBAND?
and, UM, LIEUTENANT PROVENZA, IF YOU COULD ASK TAYLOR
to TAKE KENNY WOODS TO THE RESTROOM FOR A WHILE,
and, UH, PUT MRS. LEWIS INTO INTERVIEW ROOM NUMBER 1.
Yes, MA'AM.
thank YOU. MY PLEASURE.
I'm WORKIN' REAL HARD ON GETTIN' YOU AN ATTORNEY,
but IT WOULD HELP ME A LOT IF I COULD TAKE YOUR PICTURE.
is THAT OKAY?
Oh, SURE.
no, UH, PLEASE STAND.
thank YOU.
um, IF YOU COULD, UH, WALK OVER THERE TO THE CORNER.
and, UM...
that's VERY NICE.
now, SORT OF, UM...
slump AGAINST THE WALL,
and THEN SLIDE DOWN...
to...The FLOOR.
that's GOOD.
now, UH, STRETCH YOUR LEGS OUT.
good.
now, UM, CLOSE YOUR EYES. PUT YOUR CHIN ON YOUR CHEST.
good.
now, DON'T MOVE.
thank YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Mr. COX, I BEG YOUR PARDON.
I SEEM TO BE HAVIN' TROUBLE COMMUNICATIN' WITH MY SQUAD.
I WONDER IF YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT.
radio CHECK.
I'll BE BACK IN ONE MINUTE.
sure.
take OFF
take OFF THIS RIDICULOUS HELMET!
and THE SUIT! ALL OF IT!
for HEAVEN'S SAKES.
chief, THIS COULD END THE ENTIRE TRAINING SESSION.
well, SOME THINGS ARE MORE IMPORTANT, LIEUTENANT TAO.
now, BUZZ, I NEED YOU TO PUT ON THIS HAT AND THAT SUIT. HURRY.
you WANT ME TO GO OUT THERE AND PRETEND TO BE LIEUTENANT TAO?
Yes. EXACTLY.
do I HAVE TO OVER-EXPLAIN EVERYTHING? HEY!
no, JUST NOD, BUT YOU HAVE TO DO IT QUICKLY
before MR. COX REALIZES THAT LIEUTENANT TAO IS GONE.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS, CHIEF.
as LONG AS MR. COX THINKS THAT BUZZ IS YOU
he THINKS HE'S SOMEONE ELSE ON WEDNESDAY THE 25th.
you MEAN WEDNESDAY THE 24th.
no, LIEUTENANT, I MEAN WEDNESDAY THE 25th.
lieutenant, I TOOK A PICTURE, ????????
it's FIXED.
looks AS IF SOMEONE TOOK OUT THE BATTERY.
Oh, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES. HOW DID THAT HAPPEN, I WONDER?
me TOO.
Brenda: GOOD NEWS, MR. WOODS.
I BELIEVE WE FOUND THE MAN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MURDER
you MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE WITNESSED.
no, NO, I DON'T WANT TO LOOK AT THEM.
I DON'T NEED YOU TO GIVE ME AN I.D. ANYMORE.
I JUST WANT YOU TO FEEL SAFE GOIN' BACK TO WORK.
I WANT YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT THESE PHOTOS
and LET ME KNOW IF ANYTHING JUMPS OUT AT YOU,
and THEN...
the FLOSS IS ALL YOURS.
waxed, MINT.
you CAN USE IT ALL THE WAY HOME TO YOUR ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH.
Mmm.
photos.
this ONE.
when -- WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?
Oh, UH, THAT HAPPENED THIS MORNING.
Yeah. YEAH.
that's -- THAT'S THE GUY.
Oh.
I WAS
I WAS PARKING AN '07 HIGHLANDER
when I PULLED AROUND, AND THERE THEY WERE.
and THIS GUY, HE -- HE WRAPPED SOMETHING
around THE OTHER GUY'S NECK AND HE PULLED...HARD.
and I JUST -- I -- OH...
so YOU FOUND A PHONE IN THE CAR THAT YOU WERE PARKING.
and I CALLED -- I CALLED 911.
then HE SAW ME, AND HE RAN OVER, AND I FROZE.
he BANGED ON THE WINDOW,
and HE -- HE STARTED SCREAMING THAT HE WAS GONNA
he WAS GONNA KILL ME IF I TOLD ANYONE WHAT I SAW.
then -- THEN I HEARD -- I HEARD SIRENS,
and THEN HE -- HE RAN AWAY.
Oh.
Oh.
thank you.
just CHECKIN' TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.
do YOU NEED ANYTHING?
no.
I THINK I'M OKAY.
I DON'T KNOW.
maybe I'M NOT OKAY.
well, YOU CAN CRY IF YOU WANT TO.
I DON'T WANT MY MAKEUP TO GET ALL RUINED.
but IT'S
it's -- IT'S HARD.
Glen WAS REALLY NICE TO ME.
and I KNOW GUYS ARE NICE WHEN THEY WANT SOMETHING, YOU KNOW?
Mm-hmm.
or MAYBE YOU DON'T KNOW.
but GLEN REALLY CARED ABOUT ME,
and NOW HE'S GONE.
and I HAVE NO IDEA WHEN BOB'S GONNA LET ME COME BACK HOME.
maybe I DON'T EVEN WANT TO GO.
well, MAYBE YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
we've LOOKED INTO YOUR HUSBAND'S STORY,
and THE NIGHT THAT GLEN WAS KILLED, ON WEDNESDAY THE 24th
you MEAN WEDNESDAY THE 25th.
no, TIFFANY, I MEAN WEDNESDAY THE 24th.
and YOU'RE THE SECOND PERSON IN AN HOUR TO MAKE THAT MISTAKE.
the OTHER PERSON WAS ERIC ELLIS,
the MAN WHO MURDERED YOUR BOYFRIEND.
but I DON'T THINK HE MEANT TO KILL GLEN.
I THINK HE MEANT TO KILL YOUR HUSBAND.
that WAY YOU COULD BE WITH GLEN
and NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT MESSY PRENUP.
don't I GET ANY FOURTH OR FIFTH AMENDMENT SOMETHINGS?
Yes, YOU DO.
you HAVE, FOR EXAMPLE, THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT.
anything YOU SAY CAN AND WILL
be USED AGAINST YOU IN A COURT OF LAW.
you HAVE THE RIGHT TO AN ATTORNEY.
if YOU CANNOT AFFORD AN ATTORNEY,
the COURT WILL APPOINT ONE FOR YOU.
do YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYIN'?
you ARE GOING TO ARREST ME FOR ATTEMPTING TO MURDER MY HUSBAND?
no, I'M NOT.
I WOULD HAVE, OF COURSE,
if THE STUPID HIT MAN HADN'T MADE A MISTAKE ABOUT WHAT NIGHT
to FOLLOW YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND TO DINNER.
well, THAT MIGHT'VE BEEN MY FAULT.
I'm NOT SO GOOD WITH NUMBERS.
but THE MONEY THAT YOU PAID ERIC ELLIS
to MURDER YOUR HUSBAND, THAT CAME FROM GLEN, RIGHT?
so YOU WOULDN'T BE CONNECTED TO YOUR HUSBAND'S MURDER.
it's SO UNFAIR.
Glen ENDED UP PAYING FOR HIS OWN DEATH.
I REALLY FEEL LIKE I LET HIM DOWN.
did YOU PAY MR. ELLIS UP FRONT?
what DO I LOOK LIKE, AN IDIOT?
I ONLY GAVE HIM HALF.
after YOU TOLD ME GLEN WAS KILLED,
I CALLED AND CANCELED EVERYTHING.
and I ASKED FOR MY MONEY BACK.
Ooh, I SHOULD CHECK MY MESSAGES.
I BET YOU THAT BLOCKHEAD FINALLY RETURNED MY CALL.
um, I'D HOLD OFF ON THAT IF I WERE YOU.
you ONLY GET ONE CALL,
and YOU MIGHT WANT TO USE IT TO CONTACT A LAWYER.
what?
but YOU SAID...
all RIGHT, NOW, WAIT A MINUTE, LADY!
you TOLD ME THAT I WASN'T IN TROUBLE FOR TRYING TO KILL MY HUSBAND!
that's RIGHT.
but YOU ARE UNDER ARREST FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO GLEN COOPER,
which IS MURDER IN THE FIRST DEGREE.
I DIDN'T HIRE THAT GUY TO KILL GLEN.
I HIRED HIM TO KILL MY HUSBAND,
and HE DIDN'T EVEN DO IT!
uh.
this IS A TAPESTRY OF JUSTICE.
that's WHAT IT IS -- A COMPLETE TAPESTRY.
you!
stupid HIT MAN!
stupid, STUPID!
you're THE STUPID PERSON!
you WERE SUPPOSED TO KILL MY HUSBAND!
my HUSBAND!
I THOUGHT HE WAS YOUR HUSBAND! YOU KISSED HIM!
I DON'T KISS MY HUSBAND!
you IDIOTIC...
whaa!
he's SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD!
AHHHHHH! AAH!

l don't know about this.
Vincent the kid, huh?
you're going to be one of the greats, kiddo.
l got a good feeling about this.
you say it's black, and you know it's white

you say it's good, and you know it's mean lt's the finest music that l ever seen
don't tell me nothin'

somewhere in America l can feel the tears, all lost and alone
and l feel...
Hey.
check out that guy that's playing back there.
that guy?
Yeah. this is a golden opportunity.
you know who that is?
that's Grady Seasons...
the best money player in the world.
that's Grady Seasons? You want me to play him.
you bet.
and you are going to dump.
you are going to lose something fierce.
you'll ask for the spot and the break.
lt'll be humiliating. this is beautiful.
what do you mean, dump?
lf you lose bad now to this guy...
you'll be a super nobody in Atlantic City...
and the odds on you will drop to nothing.
see? She learns. - Let me ask you.
these guys hustle, and they win.
how come l always got to play the jerk?
why can't we hustle where l win?
because there's something...
at the end of this.
l wouldn't have you do it...
unless the payoff was phenomenal.
look, do whatever you want to do. Do whatever you want.
l'll play. l ask a question, he panics.
lt's like a nightmare, isn't it?
lt just keeps getting worse and worse...
doesn't it?
are you going to fall for this?
we're gonna pay hell for this
and now we can move through it
Oh. the impossible dream.
let ourselves in for it...
don't choke now.
lt's not that hard a shot.
did you just say, " don't choke now " ?
you heard me.
Yeah. Yeah, l heard you.
let ourselves in for it
Oh!

any way that you figure it lt's down here at our fingertips

[Applause]

one more time?
Absolutely.
you remind me a lot...
of a guy l played about 20 years ago.
after that, five of us went on a road trip...
to San Antonio.
we didn't get any action.
the windup was we ended up playing each other.
that's all she wrote.
nice book, though.
buy you one?
no, l'll buy you one.
l'm going to play for a while.
lt's crazy, you know.
l was working at this job busting my butt.
they didn't give me a raise.
my old lady, she leaves me...
because she says l'm a bum...
because l quit.
then after, l start working at the university...
strictly for the experience.
guess what l was.
what were you?
l was a subject.
a what?
a subject in the psych department.
l was a subject for experiments
reflexes, memory things.
l didn't do anything...
when it got to electric shock.
l did just once, but it don't count.
Oh!
okay.
that's 80.
do it again? - Yeah, sure, l don't care.
double or nothing? - Double or nothing.
ls there an echo?
let's play.
Eddie, how you doing?
holding my own and a little bit of his.
good man.
here.
go!
go!
go!
go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
fall!
ls that it?
do it again.
double or nothing?
what else?
ha ha ha!
that is bullshit.
l never did that. that is luck, man!
l'm really sorry.
there's nothing l can do. the 9-ball fell.
l can't believe that.
are you a hustler, Amos?
come on, Eddie, man.
luck.
are you a hustler?
Hey, you don't want to pay me?
keep it. Forget it.
l don't want no bad feelings.
when the big guy loses.
l lost, l paid. l don't...
are you a hustler, Amos?
what?
you want to quit?
fuck you, kid. Double it again.
don't bother
sure enough l do
Oh, well
Hey, l want to ask you something.
l want you to be honest.
you think l need to lose some weight?
...all of my life
well, l sure don't remember
how could l get suckered like that?
you got to work hard.
that takes a real gift to show your ass like that.
everything in a stack.
everything-- just probably a little too much booze...
a little too cocky...
right amount of jerk...
to miss all those fuckin' signals.
Hey.
Eddie, you'll get him next time.
how much would you need to go it on your own...
from here to Atlantic City?
what?
should have wiped the floor with that guy.
yeah? So?
how much would you need to go to Atlantic City?
a couple thousand?
come on, Eddie.
you had too much to drink.
let's forget about it.
l got nothing left to teach.
that was the last lesson.
take the money.
front for yourself. You'll do fine.
you're walking off?
dumping us.
dumping you?
l'm giving you a stake.
l showed you all l got.
what the hell else you want?
that's it! that's all!
what are we supposed to do?
where we supposed to go from here?
here's you, see?
between you and Atlantic City...
there's about 27 pool halls.
three weeks, a couple thousand dollars.
why you talking this way?
you're played for a chump, so you walk out?
we'll get this guy next time...
Hey, hey!
you do this to some guy on the street...
not to me.
what about the stuff you told me?
you're going to ruin everything.
Carmen and me, you told me about that.
okay, look, Eddie.
Hey, it's my attitude, right?
from now on
attitude, bullshit.
you always do what you want to do!
don't tell me that!
l'm tired!
l try to do everything!
take the money.
lt's the last thing l can give you.
let it go, Vincent.
you give me money to get rid of me.
you got a long way to go.
this is nickel-and-dime shit.
shut up and give me money.
make it 3, 000.
l'll give you what l got!
you know something?
just keep your fuckin' money, pal.

l don't take much pride in that.
lt's even, but it ain't settled.
let's settle it.
why should l?
how long do you want me to fry? 5 years? 10 years?

Oh no, no l couldn't believe l couldn't believe she wrote it

and when l was finished the tears came down like rain the more l read this doggone letter
I'd like to discuss a very promising proposition for two champions.
it's a lifetime
I am a Generalin the KGB, Yevgeny.
Oh, face it! Your buddy's a damn spy.
his actions have causedthe deaths of dozens, maybe hundreds. Wake up!
the head of the Berlin station is on to the f-factthat I exist.
he may even know my identity
it's time for you to come home.
without me, Starik has nothing.
Starik has another.
here's your first fully fledged asset to handle.
don't fall in love with her.
come with me, Lili.
I need you
don't make a mistake, Jack. We just want to talk.
the girl. Who is she?
the professor used you. He is a Soviet agent.
I have betrayed him. I have betrayed you.
it wasn't your fault
and now...TNT
they're dreadfully fond of beheading people here.
the great wonder is that there's anyone left alive.
perhaps now you will tell us your rank.
my rank...
my rank...
is go to hell.
three Days Eariler Budapest, Hungary 1956
hello.
my name is Elizabet. I am to be your guide.
outside of Spain, this is the largest collection of Coellos in the world.
you were followed on your way to the museum.
who are they?
what the Hungarians call the A. V.H.--Secret police.
you're not Hungarian?
no, I'm English. My husband was Hungarian.
I saw the A. V.H. Men through my office window
a car and at least three people on foot.
Yeah. Well, it must be standard procedure for them to keep tabs on foreigners.
well, we're going out a way the A. V.H. Doesn't seem to watch.
what happens when the Hungarian secret police realizes
I'm not comin' out the front door after the museum closes?
they're so frightened of the wrath of their superiors, they shan't report you missing.
they'll simply go back to your hotel and wait for you there.
we've seen it many times before.
so what's an English girl doing mixed up in a hungarian uprising?
I'm doing this because of my husband.
how does Arpad Zelk feel about his wife being an operative in the resistance?
I am not married to Arpad. I married another Hungarian.
he was interrogated by the A. V.H. Two years ago.
he didn't survive.
I'm sorry.
he and Arpad shared a prison cell together.
one night, the guards brought my husband back to the cell.
he'd been beaten to within an inch of his life.
Arpad couldn't save him.
he just had to sit there and watch him bleed to death on a cold stone floor.
when he was released, Arpad came to tell me everything.
I didn't-- I didn't mean to pry.
of course you did.
you're an agent of the CIA.
Jack Mcauliffe, let me introduce you to Arpad Zelk.
it's an honor to meet such a distinguished poet.
as I compose my poems in hHungarian, my distinction resembles that of a bird chirping at the top of his lungs in a soundproof cage.
my friends-- fightersin the resistance.
please sit down, Mr. Mcauliffe.
Magyartrkly-- a brandy made fromthe skins of grapes after they have beencrushed to make wine.
Cheers.
and now if you please, Mr. Mcauliffe, what message do you bring to us from the united states of America?
my superiors would like you to post pone your uprising.
how long?
somewhere between a year and 18 months.
the United States cannot be drawn into a war with the Soviet Union.
we need more time.
radio free Europehas spoken endlessly in its broadcastsabout drowning by Communism.
we have been listening.
radio free Europeis not an organ of the United States government.
if you please, who pays for radio free Europe?
Mr. Mcauliffe, let me try to explain what lifeis like in Hungary.
we live in a countrysick with what we call...
doorbell fever.
everybody lives in terror that the A. V.H. Will ring their bellat midnight and take them away for questioning or torture.
hungarian people will no longer live in fear of their own government
fear that their children might be taken away, their parents, brothers and sisters never to return.
your people will listen to you.
you have influence.
no, you don't understand. You don't understand!
I cannot postpone what will happen any more than I can control it!
two Soviet tank unitshave been observed 40 milesoutside of Budapest.
they could be here in an hour.
russia needs your country for their ballistic missiles if they are to menacenato's southern flank in Italy and Greece.
they will be forced to intervene.
thucydides wrote that three things push man to war
honor, fear and self-interest.
if we go to war, for Hungarians it will bea matter of honor and fear.
we cling to the view that America will be motivatedby self-interest.
this is not a river of hatred, of revolt.
this is a waterfall of emotion.
why are you helping him?
Oh, let's say, Mr. Mcauliffe, your wife was taken from you in the middle of the night.
I don't have a wife.
but you've been in love, surely.
let's say your love was taken from you in the middle of the night, and when you asked why they were doing this, they said that she was an enemy of the people.
and what if your 3-year-old daughter was taken from you because they said you were no longer fit to raise her?
what would you do?
Where's your daughter now?
I am forbidden to see her for more than one day per year.
she lives in the country sideon a collective farm.
she's 8 years old now.
it's been 206 days since I last saw her.
if we intervene in Hungary, we risk starting something that can't be stopped.
I don't like the idea of staring into the barrel of a gun.
we're talking about a future more insidious than Fascism, Allen.
the Soviets are too vested in Hungary to back down.
if we assist with the revolution, they'll have to crush it, and then we'll be responsible for starting world war iii.
if we don't take a stand here, we run the risk of dividing the world into two halves
the one half communist, the other half democratic.
and we may never be able to penetrate the iron curtain once it slams shut.
let the light be smothed...
and the breath ceased in my throat.
this cell I share with rats...
this place that smells of death.
let then now make it a crime
trespassers of thoughts must now be locked away.
this is the one that made him famous.
when he was released fromprison, he was 29 years old, and this poem had been passed from hand to hand until half of Hungary seemed to know it by heart.
and now let thought be unholy.
let them brand me now 'I' for 'Intellectual.'
will it wash away or fade...
or must I bear its weight?'
thank you.
or must I bear its weight?'
or will it wash away the darkness?
we will bear its cruel tattoo.
out of this cell I am climbing.
we will find our place under the sun.
we will find our place under the sun!
I'd like to discuss a very promising proposition for two champions.
those who do not want to enter this world can leave now without embarrassment.
to those who choose to stay, welcome to the company.
you are an employee of the American Central Intelligence Agency, a member ofthe Soviet Russia division in Frank Wisner's directorate for operations.
since 1952, you have worked in Berlin under the guidance of Harvey Torriti.
it's-- you must have me confused with somebody else.
perhaps now you will tell us your rank.
my rank...
is go to hell.
no, no, no. Bring him.
please, no.
No!
No!
No!
No!
my name is Jack Mcauliffe. - No!
I'm an officer in the United States Central Intelligence Agency.
my pay grade is GS-15.
No!
and what message did your government bring Arpad Zelk?
leave her alone, and I'll tell you!
what message did you bring from the Americans?
No!
what message did you bring Arpad?
the message was...
if you choose to revolt, the United States government will lend its full and complete support...
Including...tIs full military might.
Jim, if we are not hereto protect the world from despots and dictators, then shoot me now, because my life workis for nothin'.
well, Frank, subtlety and patience is far more lethal to the Communists than blunt force.
gentlemen, we're here because one of our own is in trouble.
the Hungarian government has officially denied any knowledge of Jack Mcauliffe's where abouts.
the secret police have got him locked up somewhere, we just have to push harder!
you sent him in there without diplomatic immunity.
you can't claim to want a man back that you supposedly never sent in there in the first place.
Jim, he's a colleague of yours. Are you that cold?
you'd just let him rot in some Communist prison?
Jack knew the risks of the mission.
regardless of the mission, he's an American citizen!
to go hat in hand to the Hungarians
surely we can come down hardon the Hungarians if they're snatching Americans up off the streets of Budapest.
we have got to act, Allen!
or we wait.
doing nothing isn't much of a plan to put into effect.
well, Mr. Kritzky...
I'm not sure I've heard your voice in this room before.
not sure I like it.
Jack has made a lot of sacrifices for the company.
leaving him out in the cold isn't something I'm gonna keep quiet about.
Kritzky's right.
we're not gonna let one of our agents rot in prison.
okay.
well, it's the Russians who are behind it, of course.
the KGB sneezes, it's the A. V.H. That catches the cold.
we're getting nowhere with the Hungarian secret police.
on the other hand, the Kgbdoes have a vested interest in preserving the modus vivendi between two intelligence services.
so how should we approach the KGB?
well...
I've got a hunch that Mr. Kritzky already has a plan.
the sorcerer can contact his KGB counterpart in Berlin.
if they allowed their satellite countries to start taking scalps.
so, Oskar-- oh, you don't mind if I call you Oskar, do you?
you've never thought about defecting, have you?
Torriti, for this you bring me out in the freezing cold?
Oh, don't lose your water, chum.
I'm just pulling your leg.
man, you Russians ought a lighten up a little bit.
maybe get laid once in a while.
no, the only reasonI mentioned defection is because I'm--I'm concerned about your family.
what about my family?
well, suppose you kick the bucket, Oskar, would your family get a pension?
if you are threatening me, I must inform you that there are two sharpshooters with your head in their telescopic sights.
why, if I don't make it off the ice, Oskar, you can bet your ass you won't make it off, either.
no, I'm concerned with what would happen to your family if we start killing each other off.
Oh, by we I mean the KGB and the CIA.
I mean, after all, we're not Mafia Clans.
we're civilized organizations who just happen to beon either side of a divide and we don't see eye to eye on things like, uh, you know, what makes free elections free and not being afraid of being woken up in the middle of the night and dragged off to some Siberian labor camp, that kind of thing.
we must be careful to
well, that is, your KGB and my CIA-- not to hurt each other's people.
as far as I
as far as I know, we are not hurting any CIA people.
well, you don't know very far, because one of my people's in your custody right now.
but I am given regular updates of all our activities in Moscow and Berlin.
no, this particular person fell off our radar screens, hasn't been seen for two days in Budapest.
Ah, Hungary.
I'm afraid that complicates matters, Harvey.
the, um, Hungarian A. V.H. Is completely autonomous.
autonomous, my ass.
the KGB runs the A. V.H. Like it runs every other intelligence service in Eastern Europe.
you KGB guys take a crap, the A. V.H. Flushes the toilet.
Oskar, what would happen if I were to reach inside my jacket now and pull out my handgun and shove it up against your Stalin-lovin' Russki gut?
I would say it would bea form of suicide.
looks like your sharpshooters lost their competition of hide-and-seek against my crew.
Harvey!
how would you like a new blowhole, Oskar?
Oh, damn.
I forgot to load it.
anything happens to my guy, Oskar,
I'm loading this gun, and I'm coming after you.
my guy doesn't come back, your wife starts collecting your pension!
let me begin by expressing my regret at the--what shall I call it?
the zeal with which some of my Hungarian colleagues questioned you.
you handled yourself admirably under interrogation.
even under duress, you stuck with your story.
there's no story.
the United States government will stop your tanks at the border.
our courtesy extended to you does not apply to the English national who was taken into custody the same night as you.
she told us everything that was said in the meeting between yourself and Arpad Zelk.
we know the truth.
where is she?
she continues to be interrogated.
my Hungarian colleagues are hoping to put their handson Arpad Zelk before the...
the demonstrations in the city grow any larger.
that's not what I'd call demonstrations.
that's a full-fledged revolution goin' on out there.
turn around!
I'm an American! Don't shoot!
I was their prisoner! Don't shoot!
don't shoot! I was their prisoner!
don't shoot!
stop!
where is Elizabet?
She--she's still inside.
Elizabet.
Arpad.
they...they hurt me, Arpad.
don't talk, Elizabet.
I think I told them who you are.
it's over now. It's over.
I have information that could be of great help to your Central Intelligence Agency.
how did you know I was CIA?
how did you know that I worked for Wisner? That I was in Berlin with Torriti?
take me into your custody.
protect me from them, and I will tell you everything!
I think you're out of luck, buddy.
you have a mole in your CIA!
that is how I know--the mole!- Who?
I can give you information that you can surely use to find out his identity.
if he's telling the truth, he has information that could be vital to the CIA.
kill him.
I can help you, Mcauliffe!
protect me! Protect me!
protect me! Protect me!
I'll have all of you shot!
I'll line you up against the walls and shoot you myself!
hatred, smoldering for a decade, erupts without warning.
the flames of liberty and revenge against tyranny leap high.
with uncontrolled fury, crowds set fire to Russian flags and put Soviet books to the torch.
the red star is sent tumbling into the gutter.
Budapest is in revolt!
word comes of shooting on the other side of the city and the rebels, armed now, run to the scene.
a quiet park has become a no man's land.
they are showing the world that freedom is worth dying for.
do you know how to drive a tractor?
I could try. - Good.
then you can try to drive that.
Elizabet!
firing!
citizens!
citizens!
citizens!
after years of being comrades, we have suddenly become citizens.
Arpad!
arpad, listen to me.
you've got to take back control of this, or you are going to force the Soviets' hand.
if you stop now, you can still negotiate.
no negotiation, Jack.
they'll destroy you, and they will destroy everything you fought for unless you take control and stop the killing.
you think you can have half a revolution, Jack, huh?
a revolution without bloodshed? No.
the Russians will not invade for the same reason they didn't invade Yugoslavia.
they know our young people are ready to die for the revolution, and they will take a lot of young Russian soldiers with them.
you're asking me to control years of oppression, years of torture and terror?
I couldn't stop it even if I wanted to.
firing!
for god's sake, Arpad!
take these people prisoner!
no negotiation.
from Mcauliffe! - From Jack?
freedom fighters under supplied against t-34 tanks.
will fight to death for their cause.
urge powers that beto back up Hungarians. Mcauliffe.
you're gonna have to convince Cockroach alley to help the hungarianson your own, Frank!
we promised these people that we would support them.
we've got to send them troops to back them up!
Ike is absolutely adamant about not sending in troops or tanks to help the Hungarians.
most of these revolutionaries-- they're students.
they're kids, Allen.
we know we're not sending in tanks, but do the Russians need to know that?
Yes, if the Russians believe the United States is sending air coverand tanks, that could give the Hhungarians just the amount of time they need to hold out
outlast the Russians, maybe.
well, if that's the best we can do...
start radio traffic.
make sure the Soviets are listening.
hello.
Sasha.
Starik's Apartment Moscow
the Washington rezidentura used emergency contact procedures...
...to send this, Comrade Zhilov.
tell Comrade Krushchev I must see him now.
Jack! Jack, come this way!
I know a way out! Come!
through this alleyway, I know a way to kilin barracks.
stone walls 3 meters thick.
much ammunition. - Get down!
where is America now, huh? Huh?
it's over, isn't it?
it won't be over for Arpad until he's dead.
until everyone's dead.
are you willingto die for this?
Oh, why do you care, Jack?
you can go back to the CIA, to America.
this isn't even your country!
but it's my daughter's country, and I'll fight for her freedom, for her future so that she does not have to live in fear of imprisonment and torture.
and I'll stand at her father's side to do that.
attention! Attention!
throw down your weapons!
come out immediately with youe hands up...
...or you will all die here--here's another one.
mongolian units searching neighborhoods block by block, house by house, hunting for ring leaders of rebellion.
thousands of freedom fighters being thrown into boxcars, carried off in the direction of the Ukraine.
God, they're putting people into concentration camps.
here--here's one from the associated press correspondent in Budapest
under heavy machine gun fire. Any news about help?
quickly! Quickly! No time to lose.
maybe you should get some shut eye, sir. You haven't slept in days.
here, this is from a Hungarian reporter.
SOS--fighting very close now. Don't know how long we can resist.
rumors circulating American troops here within one or two hours.
is it true?
Kritzky, this country isn't being over run.
it's being exterminated.
we are seconds away from a shell coming through that window and killing everybody!
I know!
I will negotiate our surrender.
No!
No!
No!
No!
find a way out! Come with me!
come! Come!
but it's as goodas cold-blooded murder, allen.
murder!
for six years-- six years
we encouraged the Hungarians and the surrounding Soviet satellite countries to rebel against the Russian chokehold.
we sent countless messages a cross radio free Europe, spent millions creating covert capabilities for just such an occasion.
I know, Frank.
stockpiled arms across Europe, trained emigres by the thousands, and what do we do?
we--we offer damn pious phrases from Eisenhower.
the heart of America goes outto the people of Hungary.
we told these people to rise up and break free of their Communist chains!
now we're turning our backs on them!
calm yourself, Frank.
Mr. Director, I wish to state for the record that everyone here in this room
hell, everyone in Washington itself
is culpable in the deaths of these freedom fighters.
we will--All of us have blood on our hands.
we tried to warn you, Frank, but it was your methods that brought us to this place.
you know, despite your personality, I have respect for you, James.
but I hope you're wrong.
I hope to god we never have to see the world through your cynical eyes.
refugee Camp Austria
there. It's Jack.
Jack.
you made it.
how you feeling?
they gave me something for the pain.
I still don't see why I have to lie in this bed.
you've been through a hell of a lot.
just rest.
it wasn't supposed to end this way.
I read through the notes of the debriefing team in Vienna, and I am particularly interested in your suspicions regarding a mole in the company.
the, uh...A. V.H. Colonel who interrogated me, uh, he knew that I was assigned to Frank Wisner'soperations directorate, that I was in the D. D.O.'Ssoviet Russia division.
he knew that I worked in the Berlin station, that I worked under Torriti.
I believe there is a mole.
I believe it is the same Sasha who gave you up to the Russians, who in turn then informed the Hungarian secret police.
the Wiz is retiring, Jack.
I didn't know that.
hungary broke him.
apparently he feels personally responsible for the deaths of thousands.
no one can dissuade him from this idea.
I can't keep up with you anymore.
that desk job's got you soft.
I've been meaning to tell you...
how sorry I am about Hungary.
what Ike did was wrong.
he should have supported the rebels.
that's already yesterday's news.
that stuffat the Suez Canal-- Nobody remembers Hungary.
nobody will remember what happened in Budapest.
it'll go down as a foot note in history.
Oh, you don't know that.
sure I do, and so do you, Leo.
let's row.
have someone bring me the 4-2-4 file on Jack Mcauliffe, please.
Mr. Mcauliffe?
I welcome you to the rear end of the planet earth.
guatemala September 1960
Humidity--100%.
mosquito population in the billions.
malaria is a problem, as is chagas' diseaseand dengue fever.
so where did you learn to speak English so well?
fort Benning, Georgia.

I understand you've been training your troops for some time.
Cuban kids learning to strip M1s and put them together again blind folded.
the mortar teams learning to bracket their targets.
me, all of us-- we are in this thing for keeps.
we're going to win, or we are going to die.
my orders are to act as a clearing house between you and Washington.
tell me your problems, and I'll send along the ones that need solutions.
first, the CIA has to screen the recruits better in Miami before they get here.
last week I got a man who is a convicted murderer and a retarded kid who thinks Castro is a brand of sofa.
once they are here, we can't send them back because they know we exist.
all right, screen recruits.
gotcha.
I was promised portable showers, but they never came.
your military advisors, Mr. Mcauliffe, are washing in the swimming pool.
they put up a sign saying, officers only.
my men have now here to wash.
off LIMITS OFFICERS ONLY
if we're gonna be working together, you better start calling me Jack.
okay, Jack.
still serving the cheap stuff, Kritzky.
just how I like it.
my pay grade doesn't allow me to get anything better.
Dick Bissell is setting upa general capability within the company known as executive action.
its prime objective is to disable foreign leaders.
disable or disappear?
sometimes one, sometimes the other.
the plan has changed with Castro.
at first they wanted him disabled or discredited.
and now...
exactly.
the entire country is dropping dimes on one another.
people are disappearing in the night.
has to be something where the person we recruit can get away safely.
and that's where you come in.
don't worry.
bissell's executive-action planis in safe hands.
look at these men
proud fighters ready to storm the beaches to take back their homeland.
thanks to you, Jack, they will do it with honor.
thanks to me?
many of these men left the only world they ever knew.
they have not felt part of something in a very long time.
Roberto,America will supply you with B-26s.
we'll train your pilots.
we'll give you a life time supply of M1 Ammo.
we will help you covertly, not overtly.
you have to do the rest.
Yes, yes, I looked everywhere comrade.
I checked everything for the last five years.
are you sure? Maybe you missed something.
no, no, comrade...I missed nothing.
this woman, Azalia Ivanova never left Russia.
legally, anyway.
she can't just have disappeared!
you are a very funny man.
goodbye.
over angry Cuban protests, the United States retaliates by cutting off its imports of cuban sugar.

the United States and Cuba have reached the point of no return.
in Washington, the administration is now convinced it is in the United States' national interest to get rid of Fidel Castro.
bang.
he just won a one-way trip to spy heaven.
what's that all about, Harvey?
mother is ruining the company with his damn suspicions.
news to me.
you know, a lot of good people have been passed over for promotion because they're on Angleton's short list of possible moles.
they're all going over to the private sector where they're getting paid twice as much.
let's get back to reality, huh?
our cosa nostra associates.
these jokers have nothing to lose by helping the agency, Harvey.
rosselli and Giancana help knock off Castro, and whether they succeed or not
whether they even try or not
it gives them a working immunity against prosecution with the attorney general Bobby kennedy.
I don't want a paper trail on this.
no memos.
I don't even want a phone call.
you set up a slush fund of cash to work with, and we never speak together in public again.
Brooklyn, New York 1960
you still speak the Sicilian dialect?
it's not something you forget.
I'm half Sicilian on my mother's side.
Johnny Rosselli.
I hope the last-minutes witching of the meet didn't piss you off, but I like Brooklyn better than Manhattan.
it's good tradecraft.
what's tradecraft?
taking precautions.
Oh, precautions.
precautions, well...
precautions is how come I'm still alive.
so, Mr. Rosselli, how's business since you lost the Sans Souci casinoin Havana?
well, it's not nearly as good as it was before the Cubans went Commie.
well, I take it you'd, uh...
you'd like to see the Communists gone.
evaporated from the planet would be better.
I tell you, I don't understand commies.
I mean, what the hell they gotagainst free enterprise, right?
bang, bang.
you just won a one-way tripto birdie heaven.
what would you say if I told you the interests I represent would be willing to open a discussion about removing your problem in Cuba?
you want the Cosa Nostrato knock off Castro, right?
my orders come from the very top.
casinos opening up, tourists flooding in.
Ah. I'm as patrioticas the next guy.
if whacking Castrois good for my country, it's good enough for me.
hold it!
don't move, Eugene!
don't move.
now why did you hesitate?
why didn't you go upstairs?
a sign, huh?
well, you know what? There's nowhere to run, all right, 'cause we know everything, and your buddy Max Kahnis all locked up.
now lose the groceries.
get your hands on your head.
okay.

I sort of ran away from an angry girlfriend.
Alice in Wonderland
Miami, Florida November 1960
you know what I miss?
Cuban frickin' cigars.
now that is reason enough to whack the son of a bitch.
so how do you see this hit?
well, I imagine some of your associates might way lay Mr. Castroand gun him down.
I don't see using gunson castro for the simple fact that no one pulling off the hit could get away with all thembodyguards or whatever around.
well, how do you see it?
castro likes milk shakes.
milk shakes?
now he always offers to pay for them milk shakes, but nobody never takes his money.
someone could, say, spike his milk shake and escape by seain a fast boat.
it might work.
might work?
it's golden, pal.
you give me the right poison,
I'll get someone in Havanato put it in Castro.
tthese are U-2 photographs taken yesterdayof the bay of pigs.
it's a 13-mile stretchof beach.
as you can see, there's three causeways leading downfrom the swamps.
if the invasion forceis going to succeed, they have to securethose causeways.
now the air stripis a god send.
it's long enough to handle B-26s.
air strikes could plausibly look Cuban from D-day onward.
and once we securethese beaches, then planes can take off from that air strip.
castro's troops?
around 100 militiamen from the 338th militiabattalion in 5 barracks, one motor pool and a radioshack--no armor, no artillery.
and if the brigade needs to fall back?
Oh, if push comes to shove,Kennedy will have to send in the Calvary.
sir, Kennedy specifically told director dulles that he would never authorize overt American intervention.
let me tell you something, Kritzky.
if you want to be a great president, you gotta be a wartime president.
kennedy will back the rebels.
you mark my words.
Hello, Gene Lutwidge.
uncle, this is no fun.
quiet, girls! Quiet.
we weren't ready!
exactly.
look at me, girls.
how long must we do this?
when I tell you.
it's cold in here, Uncle!
girls, please.
like that. That's good.
what?
my apologies, Comrade Zhilov.
they said it was of the utmost urgency.
I was told to give you this envelope.
I was told that if you did not immediately open the envelope...
...I should relay the following message:
Eugene Dodgson is retired.
gene Lutwidge is active.
Yevgeny.
what can we do for you, Mr. Torreti?
Torriti.
you can get me an Alka-Seltzer.
no, no, no.
Oh, my. Do you have an upset stomach?
no. I want you to arrange for someone else to have an upset stomach.
how upset do you want this person's stomach to become?
I'd like that person's stomach to stop functioning.
which would suggest you don't want to give anyone time to, uh, pump his stomach.
no. You got it, Doc.
no, no, no.
I'm afraid an alka-seltzeris far too big.
the smaller it is, the easier it is to slip into a liquid without anyone noticing.
you do want the perpetrator to get away with the crime, I take it?
that would be a good idea.
timetable?
I was thinking hurrying, but not rushing.
that's nicely put.
the hustle without the bustle.
the haste without the waste.
would that everyone in the CIA function the way you do, Mr. Torreti.
Torriti.
we have to take precautions.
this line is unsecured.
I have some very interesting news for Starik that can't wait for dead drops.
you're gonna have to remember what I tell you, and then encode it and send it immediately.
what's the news?
it's about a certainis land nation south of Florida.
d-day minus two.
so far, so good, Jack.
what's your problem now?
when was the last time you heard of a troop ship going into combat crammed with 1, 000 tons of ammunition below deck?
Jack, Castro only has16 operational warplanes.
our B-26s are going to destroy them on the ground long before we hit the beaches.
I hope you're right.
I know why I'm here.
I know why my boys are here.
why are you here?
I was assigned, Roberto.
I heard you volunteered.
Why?
well, as a friend of mine once said, the damn goths are at the damn gate.
someone's gotta man the gate.
and that someone is you, Jack?
why not?
the invasion of Cuba is clearly a violation of several treaties as well as American law, which specifically prohibit senlistment and/or recruitment for foreign military expeditions as well as the outfitting of foreign naval vessels for service against a country with which we are not at war.
in my view, senator Fulbright, success isself legitimizing.
it legitimized Castro when he seized control.
it legitimized the founding fathers.
I've always taken it for granted that, uh, Washington and Jefferson would have been hangedas traitors if the revolution had failed.
the United States is eternally condemning Moscow for meddling in the internal affairs of Sovereign countries.
intervention in Cuba now will open the door for Soviet intervention anywhere around the world.
the soviets are already intervening in many countriesin the world, senator.
all right.
no matter how Cuban the operation is made to appear, the entire planet will hold the United States and the Kennedy administration accountable for it.
are you speaking...
for the president?
no, but I am advising him strongly to end this madness before it starts.
if Cuba is so dangerous to the national interest, we should declare war and send in the marines.
the ships are already at sea, senator.
it's already begun.
six weeks after the secret meeting at the white house, Fidel Castro has publicly charged that the United States is training an army to invade Cuba.
now planes from the aircraft carrier Essex
patrolling the airways between Cuba and the invasion fleet have seen no indication of increased air or sea activity on the part of Castro's forces.
sir, we have new information here.
um, 312th Cuban battalion stationed off the Isle of Pines has canceled all liberty leaves until further notice.
Oh, could just be part of the general maneuvers.
it worries me.
I have to be honest, Dick.
every time we see a detail that would appear to warn us off the invasion, we somehow manage to explain it away.
it's a blind spot we seem to have.
do you have a suggestion, Ebby?
we may have to stop looking at the details and see if the entire operation itself isn't flawed.
I agree.
everyone in this room continues to try to find reasons to pursue this foolishness.
yet no one will ask the big question
should we even carry out this operation?
and the worst of it...
the world will see this folly for exactly what it is
a CIA operation start to finish.
what business do we have to mount an invasionVof a country just because the Kennedy Vsare pissed off at the guy who runs it?
don't we have an army and a navy for that, an air force, marines?
if this invasion fails, it will cripple the company for years to come.
ridding the hemisphere of Castro, freeing the Cuban people from the oppression of Communism is clearly legitimate.
you're forgetting one thing, Sick.
Sasha.
Oh, right, um, your mole.
as long as sasha exists, and he does exist, Dick...
valuable informationis being funneled directly to our adversary, which means the Kremlin knows, which means...
castro knows.
hotel Libre, Havana 1961
you know who I am, Arturo?
you know my job?
my position in the government?
sir?
I have a difficult job.
it's hard to make friends.
it's good to-- to know each other.
hopefully you and I can be friends, for I already know much about you, and your cousin Jaime's fishing boat, which he keeps at the Portin Cohimar.
Arturo, friends do not lie to each other.
empty your pockets, Amigo.
how much were you paid to assassinate Fidel Castro?
I swear on the grave of my mother, I know nothing of this.
who gave you your orders?
I swear this on the Bible.
the Bible?
these questions I ask you, Arturo Padron, they are rhetorical.
do you know this word--"rhetorical"?
do you know what it means?
it means you already know the answers.
don't you like milk shakes?
perhaps vanillais not your flavor?
since you are so keen on tossing around the good book, perhaps you may remember one of my most beloved passages from the Bible -
woe unto that man by whom the son of man is betrayed.
it had been good for that man if he had not been born.
drink.
well, first I want to say that there will not be, under any conditions, be an intervention in Cuba by United States armed forces, and this government will do everything it possibly can, and I think it can meet its responsibilities to make sure that there are no Americans involved in any actions.
250 meters!
250 meters!
150 meters!
150 meters!

Roger, carpetbagger, this here is whistle sto combat Information Central Reports Castro still has operational aircraft.
expect y'all gonna be hit soon.
unload all troops and supplies and take your ships to sea asap.
what about air cover we're supposed to have over the beach?
combat Information Central has a sighting from one of our seahawks.
enemy battalion.
estimated 900 men.
repeat-- 900 men spotted approaching the middle causeway.
one pilot counted 60, say, 60 vehicles and a dozen stalin tanks.
he's onshore?
I want his ass back on that boat now!
what about Kennedy's promise of air support?
it was only to strafe Castro's air force planes on the ground.
reports are saying that there's as many as half a dozen of Castro's sea fury aircraft still operational.
they'll besitting ducks.
take cover!
so the units that were blocking the causeways had to retreat, and now Castro's tanks have rolled unchallenged to within firing distance of the two landing beaches.
casualties are heavy.
how many?
100 dead, twice that wounded.
four of the national guard pilots who trained the Cubansin Guatemala took matters into their own hands.
they flew a sortie in 2 B-26s.
both planes were shot down over Cuba.
kennedy must authorize jets to fly combat mission sover the beaches.
he absolutely refuses.
it would take the mall of 45 minutes to clean up the causeways, Allen.
I've just come from the oval office.
kennedy said he will not commit American armed forces into combatto save this mission.
then everybody on that Beachis as good as dead.
I'm aware of that, Dick.
come here.
take him.
here.
get them all off the beach!
get them all off the beach!
okay.
come on.
Jack, my men are going to be massacred in a matter of minutes.
Where's the damn air cover?
grow a pair of balls, Bissell.
go over Dulles' head.
go over the president's head if you have to.
this isn't some recon flight you can just bury in a report, Harvey.
it's the invasion of a damn country!
I'd be out on my ass forever, maybe thrown in prison!
Dick, please.
Jack is dead unless we get him some air cover now.
whistle stop, need air cover!
beach is compromised!
Repeat--need air cover!
whistle stop--do you copy me?
whistle stop--need air cover!
get your ass out of here, Jack!
you can't help us anymore.
damn it, R oberto, I'll leave when everyone leaves!
Jack, we don't need America's help anymore.
castro will capture you!
he'll tell the world we were led by American officers.
he'll tell the world my men died for America, not for Cuba!
I'm not leaving, Roberto!
I'll kill you myself before I let you fall into their hands alive.
I swear to you, I'll kill you!
I mean it,Jack, I'll blow your damn head off.
you'll just be another body floating in the surf.
they'll never know who you were.
go, Jack.
go now.
I'm sorry.
don't take away our dignity.
it's the last thing we've got.
Vmanos!
carpetbagger, come in!
Carpetbagger!
this is whistle stop.
carpetbagger, do you read?
carpetbagger.
this is whistle stop.
carpetbagger, come in.
Carpetbagger!
carpetbagger, do you read?
at 3: 45 P. M.Wednesday, april 19th, resistance ends.
all those who are not killed are taken prisoner.
in less than 72 hours, Castro has destroyed the brigade.
the American planned, financed, trained and backed invasion of Cuba is now a total failure.
Oh, Jack.
Leo says you've been through hell.
Yeah, Adelle, I have.
it's a week's salary, so, uh, enjoy it.
castro's conducting sham trials.
they're probably executing Roberto and dozens of his men within weeks.
hell, half of 'em aren't even 20 years old.
they're just kids.
I know it, buddy.
I'm sorry.
I'm turning in my resignation tomorrow, Leo.
no, you are not!
I wanted to let you know before I went to the director.
Oh, yeah?
what are you gonna do without the company?
private sector.
pay's better.
and people you know don't die.
Hey, we set out to change the world, remember?
listening to the Wiz make his recruitment speech
we were sitting on the edge of our seats, you and me.
am I still on the edge of my seat, Leo?
are you?
you're a true believer.
you can't help it.
I'm not so sure.

Eddie, how you trackin'? - We're hot.
how hot? - White hot.
I got "A" team blitzing chat rooms and blogs.
b" team's buying ads and placing the spots.
site's getting 700 hits per minute.
awareness on porn and fight blogs: 92%. - Bella's got a new 30.
I want you to run that across every sex, fight and gamer site now.
hit the gamers hard.
got it. - Push it, people. Push it.
somewhere, someone on this planet does not know about this show.
asia, Africa, Antarctica.
there's a fucking Eskimo sitting in his little igloo...
who does not know that we go live in 22 hours.
find him. Get him. Eddie.
Ninety-two? I want a hundred.
100% awareness across this Internet.
you got it? - You got it.
did you leave- No more oranges today.
that's it for the oranges, okay? Throw it away.
is that solo ready?

Hey, pal. - Hey.
just so you know, we're fucked.
Oh, yeah. We are screwed.
this show ain't happenin'.
goldman, come on. Talk to me.
where are we at?
where are we at?
I've got 87 cluster-cams ready and rigged.
I got 147 solos with all built-in mikes, okay?
I got 60 to 70 all ready to go out in the field.
so altogether there's 400 lenses, right? - Great.
but there are dead spots all over this island.
I do not have enough time. This show is not going off.
we are at war, Goldy.
gotta improvise, overcome, adapt.
this is not war, Breck. This is television.
it's much more complicated. I do not have enough hardware...
and if you haven't noticed, we're in the middle of nowhere.
mango, do not touch. What did I say before?
I told you an hour and a half ago. Do not touch. Thank you.
and on top-Where are you going with that? Can I have that? Thank you.
here's the really cool thing. I got these all-stars.
it's really great, because between the lot of them...
they all speak three words of English.
so I'm supposed to run an operation...
that is basically bigger than Farm Aid meets We Are the World...
and I'm supposed to do it in sign language?
are you out of your mind? Do I look like QuincyJones?
Breck. - You know, it's all gonna work out.
you know why? - Why?
cause you're the best.
for the love of Christ. - Hey, babe.
Donna Sereno just arrived.
good. She know the score?
tomorrow morning. You're her top story.
but be ready.
she's a tough nut.
she's the big dog.
want the big press, gotta go to the big dog.
right. Do it like that.
all right. How do I look?
I'd do ya.
Yeah, but how do I look?
go get 'em.
lettuce? Do you want tomato or anything?
give me that freakin' sandwich.
go to work on my satellite.
so, without a major network behind you, how do you plan to broadcast your show?
the Internet.
I've pulled 10 contestants from third world prisons.
each was on death row. I will free one of them.
see, tomorrow, I'm gonna bring them here to this island...
where I will give them a fighting chance at a new life.
it's a fight to the death.
one lives, nine die?
you're airing a live snuff film.
no, Donna.
these contestants were already dead- condemned.
I'm allowing one to live. Is that so wrong?
it's immoral and illegal.
you're a multimillionaire who may become a billionaire producing murder.
I'm done with Hollywood.
I'm going direct to my audience, worldwide and live.
and my numbers will demolish any show on any network this year.
mark my words.
Breck, we have a problem.
I like to think of it more as a challenge.
we just lost one of our headliners.
what do you mean "lost"?
they shot my Arab? - Uh-huh.
we had him on the mainland, and they shot my fuckin' Arab?
relax. Relax. Okay. We got a replacement.
how'd the interview go? - Smooth as butter.
replacement? Who? What? Where? What have we got?
jose Havanando.
hard-core Guatemalan.
convicted of 13 torture killings. He's ready to go.
I don't want a fucking Guatemalan.
I already got two Mexicans.
look. You see here?
this is the Arab world.
if they don't have anybody to cheer for, they don't log on.
I want a fucking Arab!
Child-killing, Koran-ranting, suicide-bombing Arab.
okay, okay. We're on. Our scout in Central America...
has got a line on a 6'7" Islamic fundamentalist.
he's in a joint in El Salvador. Warden's good to go.
he's ours if we want him. - Get him online.
crew's en route to the prison now.
Hashim.
gringo, the warden wants you now.
tell the warden to go fuck himself.
what's this all about?
bullshit.
can I go now?
who the hell is this guy? What have you got, Eddie?
American.
arrested one year ago in San Miguel, El Salvador.
killed three men.
awaiting death sentence.
thank you, God.
I thought you wanted an Arab.
forget the Arab. I got this guy. He's perfect.
with anti-Americanism rampant all over the globe...
people are gonna love to hate this cowboy.
clean him up. Let's bring him down.
get him on a plane.
come here. Give me the key. I'll do you a deal. Hey, come back.
Americano, huh? Big boy.
gonna cut you like sazizza, capito?
so where they pull you from?
put a muzzle in it, boy.
you're already boring me. - Who you callin' "boy"?
Ewan McStarley. London, England.
four years, Special Forces.
three peacekeeping tours through Africa.
set fire to a village in Rwanda.
executed 17 men, raped nine women." Torture. Mutilation. Good stuff.
you ladies should get along real good.
what in the fuck is wrong with you?
all in a day's work, Rasta.
get this top off her.
we're in show business, not a soup kitchen.
Where's my new guy? The American.
right over there.
Hey. I'm lan Breckel.
I produce television. - Well, good for you.
maybe you heard of me.
bud, I ain't been watchin' too much TV lately.
why don't you have a seat?
you and the others will be taken to an island...
where you'll fight against each other.
if you're the last one left alive after 30 hours...
I will set you free with a pocket full of cash.
how's that sound? - What's this got to do with TV?
not TV. The Internet.
I'll be streaming the entire event live across the World Wide Web.
your rap sheet's a little thin.
Jack Conrad, American.
blew up a building in El Salvador, killing three men.
what were you doing in El Salvador? - Workin' on my tan.
why'd you blow the building up? - It was blockin' my sun.
what do you do for a living, Jack? - I'm an interior decorator.
okay. I see.
well, where are you from back in the States then, huh?
Alaska. - Alaska. Whereabouts?
about 80 miles north of Anchorage.
little fishing town. You probably heard of it.
it's called Fuck Your Mama.
babe, do me a favor.
why don't you write a bio for this redneck. Let's say he's from Arkansas.
an arsonist, a racist, a KKK Klansman.
blew up a Baptist church. Fugitive from the FBI.
ended up in Central America...
where he blew up a clinic for retards and handicapped people, killing dozens.
women, children, blah, blah. Do it right now. Get it to Bella.
I don't know who you are, and I don't care.
but I don't play games.
you don't have to win...
but everybody plays.
come on.
Hey, boss. How about something to eat?
Oh, yeah. Husband and wife. Lovers.
you know, you can stick together, fight as a team...
but the fact of the matter is, only one of you will get off the island alive.
easy. Easy.
easy.
hope you can run your feet as fast as you run your mouth.
easy, Rosa.
let's get out of here.
okay. Listen up, gang.
on your ankle you all have a rig...
packed with 20 ounces of plastic explosive.
twenty ounces.
that's enough to incinerate you, your dog...
and the small house you may be residing in at the time.
in exactly 30 hours from now...
that plastic explosive will do what it does best.
you want that rig removed from your ankle...
simply be the sole survivor in 30 hours from now.
there are two other ways to detonate an ankle rig.
one: You see that red pull tab?
yank on that, and after a 10-second delay...
boom.
two:
tamper with the rig, you mess with the wires, you try and pick the lock...
instantly, without delay...
boom.
it's a very simple game.
kill...
or die.
choppers are coming. Cons are on the way. We ready? Goldy?
what, are you kidding me? Absolutely not.
Bella? - Yeah. I was born ready.
Eddie? - Good to go.
Bella, give me some old-school rock and roll.
Goldy, our satellite gonna hold up?
Hey, no.
Bella, cue the music.
Eddie.

Hey, gringo! I'll look after your wife!
okay. Give me 182-B.
that's genius, Goldy.
I tell you, man. You're the best.
say that again.
I'll be waiting for your ass in the bush!
it's going to be a festa!
breakfast, lunch and dinner!
okay. You're up. Let's go.
open up! Open your mouth!
I said open your mouth! Put that in your mouth!
get out of here.
Oops. - Oops?
that's no "oops." That's a fuckup times 10.
give me this.
Hey, idiots. Watch where you're tossing these guys.
I got a fucking show to put on.
open up.
open your mouth.
come on. Open your fuckin' mouth.
goddamn it! - He never saw that coming.
you dumb son of a bitch!
Eddie, talk to me.
we got 'em all in a nice little cluster on the south end of the island.
good. - It's only a matter of time.
Breck. - Action. We got action.
get me in there.
Bella, give me some music. All right. What have we got?
we're on 23, 24, 31 - all good angles. We're on 23 now.
this is hard-fucking-core, man!
that's gotta hurt.
she's pulled it. She's pulled it.

five million users have just logged on to the site.
okay. Well, that's a start.
that's a start?
well, what are you after?
you know how many households watch the Super Bowl?
Yeah, like 40 million. - Right. That's what I'm after.
well, that's impossible. - Yeah, really?
you wait till the blogs and chat rooms...
trust me, Goldy. The Internet- it's wildfire.
good work.
you trackin' me? Are you following me?
no, ese.
partner, you can move on or things are gonna get a little rough.
easy, ese.
I'm looking for my wife.
that's all I want.
my Rosa.
gringo, try this.
this shit is fucked up.
now that's what I'm talkin' about.
what's your coverage here? - Cluster-cam set.
got three additional cameras in this location.
let's spice it up then, huh? Slice and dice.
Yeah. I'm slicing and dicing. Do I tell you how to do your job?
Thanks.
calm down, homey.
get down.
nice. - I love this Japanese dude.
come on. Who's your money on? Who do you like?

Hey, Breck. Something's going down.
I got two cons right on top of each other.

Hey. You hear that, Goldy? Twelve million.
Yeah. Well, 12 million still isn't 40 million.
still ain't no Super Bowl. - Not yet.
Bella, Eddie, replay that fall in super slo-mo until we get something better.
LAN Breckel. Where is he? What do we know?
he could be streaming the data to a server from almost anywhere.
I've contacted Interpol.
they're collecting information from agencies all over the world.
the island is somewhere in the South Pacific.
I got World War II historians and regional experts...
examining the images from the Web site.
between Indonesia and New Guinea there are, like, 2, 000 tiny islands.

he escaped incarceration- 2002.
ironically, two years later, ends up on death row in Malaysia.
what about the other guy? - I can't find a thing.
it's like he doesn't exist.
I just got a tip on the hotline about the American, Jack Conrad.

only he says his real name's Jack Riley.

the drama- I want it up there.
not here. Okay? Please.
LAN, how can you let this go on?
it's just happening. And we're shooting it. It's not my doing.
it is your doing.
you set it up.
I put 10 people out there, and whatever happens, happens.
pure reality.
Yeah. - No intervention.
where the hell do you think you're going?
fresh air.
what?
you're getting all soft on me, are you?
I'm gonna hear a crybaby story from you too?
or are we just having a crisis of conscience?
no, Breck. It's not- It's
it's
it's not exactly easy to watch.
but I'm with ya.
Eddie, are you with me?
hell yeah. I love this job.
Bella?
I love what I do. We're a team, Breck.

I don't want to kill you.
I just want to get this bomb off my leg.
you can trust me.
he's letting her go? - For fuck's sake. What is this?
friendship Island?
how's your knee?
I can't walk. I can't fight.
you kill them for me.
Hey, I'm sorry, amigo. There's something I gotta do.
I saw a weather tower on the north end of the island.
there's gotta be a radio in there.
you call for help?
we're light-years from help, man.
you got a woman...
or a wife?
Yeah.
something like that.
drop a Christmas bag to McStarley. Give him the works.
send him to theJapanese ruins.
I'll take that. Think that's got my name on it.
we got everything but a kitchen sink in here, mate.
we got knives- Look at this.
cigars.
someone up there likes us, boy.
we've won the fucking jackpot, mate.
you better limber up, son. We got a show to put on.
settle yourself down a bit.
Jesus.
what you doing?
you see that? GPS.
I don't like being tracked.
vanished? - He's gone. He's not on my grille.
you got some water.
take this.
Where's he going?
I don't know.
keep an eye on him.
Yeah.
we have to drop the investigation intoJack Riley.
two Americans are trapped in this thing, sir.
Brad, this is not a conversation, okay?
just hours ago, you told me to get to the bottom of it.
now why are you telling me to drop it?
when you started digging intoJack Riley...
you caused a lot of people a lot of stress where I work.
and where is that? - The Pentagon.
this is Wade Meranto, DIA.
we know all there is to know aboutJack Riley.
is he a killer or not?
well, he's probably killed more men than anyone on that island.
he retired, but his old boss- my boss
calls him up from time to time.
black ops.
ayear ago he was sent to El Salvador to demolish a Vallejo drug plant...
profits being used to fund our enemies.
got the job done, killed several men
all known drug traffickers with the Vallejo Cartel.
he traveled with bogus papers in the name ofJack Conrad.
although they tried.
so you let him fry in a Central American prison for an entire year?
and they get hired for the same reason they get fired
it's bullshit.
Nope.
okay. Breck, as you can see, the American-Yul Brynner- he is gone.
he is off my monitors completely.
I had him and then I lost him.
and the reason why I lost him is because he is headed towards us.
and I did not rig cameras where we are at.
relax, Goldy. - You know what?
I'm gonna relax when killers and rapists are on the other side of the island.
is that cool?
I'll find him.
you two take the jeep. We'll take the dogs on foot. Let's go.
take the south road, do a circle and come back.
Yep, you got it.
check the perimeter. - All right.
take one of these.
Hello?
Sarah, it's me.
just listen. I don't have much time.
for your own safety.
did you think I walked out on you?
I didn't know what to think.
I've been through this before.
and then
and then you leave me. - Sarah, listen to me.
Why?
I did not walk out on you.
I love you.
I love those boys of yours like my own.
you understand that?
Jack, l- - Hold on. Hold on.
I'm not through. Grab yourself a pen.
write this down.
cross National Bank.
2543456. - Jack, what is this?
what are you doing?
I got some money saved up.
it ain't much, but I'll feel better knowing you have it.
maybe it'll help things out around the house with you and the kids.
you know I don't want money, Jack. I want you.
just in case?
ayear ago, you say you're leaving for work...
and I don't hear from you till now?
Where've you been, Jack?
you gotta tell me what's going on, Jack.
just listen to me. - You gotta tell me now.
I want you back here with me. That's all I want.
tell me you're coming home.
do you understand me? I need you.
I need you back here with me.
Breck, we got a breach of the gate.
he's in the tower.
what's goin' on? - It's Conrad. He's here.
Oh, great. That's nice. Right here with us.
shut the tower down. Kill the generator.
I gotta go. - No, wait.
I spoke to an FBI agent. Where are you?
tell me something. They've got nothing.
Jack? - I'm here. Hang on.
all right. Write this down.
latitude 7. 549282.
longitude is
Jack? Jack!
stay back. I'm coming.
No! God.
there he is!
fuck! Move it!
he's out! He's out! - Go! Go!
Hi. May I speak to Agent Brad Wilkins?
I'm sorry. He's in a meeting. - It's urgent.
the island's somewhere on the seventh parallel.
I got it right here.
please tell me that we're gonna do something.
Jack Riley did a year in a Salvadorean prison.
interrogation.
torture.
he never gave up a word. All to protect you...
his country.
what a woman like you do to end up here?
plenty.
you know we're gonna die.
I fight till the end.
this is the end. Wake up and have a cup.
are you okay?
awful. Just awful.
stop, please. Stop.
you want me to stop? - Oh, yeah, stop.
hello.
I think they're gonna get it on.
you say the last time you trusted a woman...
you ended up on death row.
what happened?
well, get this.
I'm bein' transferred to Folsom.
a stroke of luck.
in transit, I bust out, make my way to Mexico.
I'm off to Malaysia.
I set up my own hash spot.
I started seein' this native girl.
beautiful...
sweet, sexy.
I'm in heaven.
I'm rich, I'm free, in love.
she get nailed on some bullshit possession charge.
she tell the cops everything.
man, when they come, I got 14 pounds of hash under the bed.
you know what that means in Malaysia?
death row again.
it's just gonna take some time before I let my guards down.
you know what I'm sayin'?
you feel me, baby?
Hey, baby, where you at?
bitch got me again! Motherfucker!
not again! Not again! Not
very clever.
smokin'.
what the hell just happened? - Another one bites the dust.
the black American dude, gone.
get this off and get on something else now.
okay? Change it.
Oh, nice.
Jesus Christ.
sun ain't even up and the Mexican's having another bad day.
McStarley's back. This is gonna be gnarly.
okay, cover the mess.
you're dead!
good times.
hit him again! - Watchin' beaner boy get his ass beat.
he's not even trying.
he's my boss...
and yet he's my best friend.
a genius.
the man could sell dirt to a ditchdigger.
we've both been sold.
I know.
Goldy, we have to stop this.
let me get hold ofhim. Hold on.
this is not reality. You manipulated this.
you sent them there so they could do this to an injured man...
who's already watched his wife get
don't tell me you won't intervene, because you already have.
twenty-eight million people watching something I created.
and not a single network gets a piece of it.
it's too much for me, Breck.
but it is not okay now. It's too much.
we have now crossed a line that is beyond the line that I thought we were gonna cross.
all right. All right. Some of it's a little difficult to watch, okay?
to create drama you need good guys, bad guys and victims.
all right? That's storytelling.
no. This is not a teleplay that you are writing.
this is real. It's too fuckin' real, and I can't hold down food.
real?
nothing's real.
all manufactured and manipulated just like this.
to entertain.
Goldy, do you think this guy had more dignity awaiting the electric chair in Guatemala City?
Yeah. I do.
you do not come in here and team up against me with her. You understand?
you both knew what you were getting into. Both of you.
I'm done debating this. You make a choice right now.
either you're with me or against me...
but I want your answer.
right now.
right now.
what'll it be?
I'm gonna finish the show.
you can't do the show. - I don't wanna hear it.
you know this as well as I do! - I don't wanna hear it!
I'm goin' back to the monitors. - Goldman! Goldy!
any idea how ridiculous you've sounded in the last 24 hours?
what, are you trying to save some goddamn whore?
I was trying to save you.
nice.
where you been all night? - He's had enough!
enough?
you think this little Mexican geezer's had enough?
shit! We ain't even started.
hit him again.
beauty!
what do you think? I might hit him from here, Yank.
you're out! You like that, Yank?
yo, Yank.
I got you down as military... like myself.
special Forces, SAS.
me and you, we got a lot in common.
we got nothin' in common, you and me.
that disappoints me. That makes you soft.
this... I'm gonna do for you.
burn, baby, burn!
game on.
what is that place? - I don't know.
Conrad.
get up!
come on!
go around!
shit.
you gotta be kiddin' me. - Try me.
Bull's-eye! Come on, Yank!
show yourself!
get me inside that bunker.
show yourself! I'll put this right through your fuckin' heart.
son of a bitch.
get up. Get up. Come on.
come on, Yank!
Oh, God.
that's great. Torched the cameras.
run, baby. Go. Go.
Yeah!
give me your hand.
what are you doing?
Hey, kid.
holy shit! It's Jack!
Yeah! Yeah!
all right!
let's go, sweetheart.
just you and me.
let's dance, asshole.
not today.
he won't, man. He won't jump.
fuck it.
okay, so where are they? - I'm looking.
come on. - I'm looking.
where are they? Find 'em.
for God's sake. What, you don't have a camera down there?
do I look likeJacques Cousteau? I don't do underwater caves.
hence, dead spots. - Eddie, what do you have?
I got nothin'.
for Christ's sakes.
I've got angles, lots of angles.
get the live unit down there.
Where's my boy McStarley?
Yes. Happy days.
now for the big finish.
you helped this maniac the entire time...
I threw him a bone.
Hey, Yank!
you lookin' for me, you piece of shit?
you dance, Yank? Let's see you dance now!
come on, you fucker! - Cocksucker.
fuck you.
shit. - You want some more, you fucker?
come on!
let's finish this man to man!
Hey!
show's over, Yank!
what do you think this is? A fancy dress party?
I'm just a cameraman. - Film this.
merry Christmas.
come on!
you motherfucker! How do you like this?
come on, Jack! Yeah! There you go!
shit!
Jack. No, no.
nothing we do as entertainers are gonna make a difference, all right?
you just think about it.
just some of the games and the movies that we make
it helps them to escape into that world for 'em.
you know what I mean? That's being a teenager, right? Teenagers
they're just teenagers. - So, what about children?
Yeah, sure. They can. If they have a credit card.
look, Donna, we, as entertainers...
cannot tailor-make everything we do for children.
it's the parents'responsibility to monitor what their kids watch.
that's a cop-out, lan, and you know it.
you have to take some responsibility.
Donna, I'm not forcing anybody to log on and tune in.
I create shows people like to watch. I didn't create the demand.
people like to watch violence.
they always have.
probably always will.
when I finished this interview, I was angry at one man
LAN Breckel.
over the past 24 hours, millions have logged on to his Web site.
and with his success I am no longer angry.
I am sad.
those of us who reward him...
those of us who watch...
are we the condemned?
you'll be pleased to know they found the island.
navy SEALs will be there in one hour.
it's too late.
Hey, Breck, check it out.
forty million. - 171 countries worldwide.
Bella, you have the new highlights reel cut together?
done.
run that until we bring our winner back.
we did it, Breck.
big choppers here?
no. Just yours. They took the setup crew back to the mainland.
all right. I'll collect my things. You meet me at the chopper in 10 minutes.
and the crew?
if the military's coming, they're coming for me, not them.
it's my ass that'll fry.
meet me at the chopper in 10 minutes.
Hi.
what's up?
goin' somewhere, Breck?
you lied to me. Where the hell are you goin'?
what's up? - What's up? The navy's coming.
you can't just leave everybody here. You promised that you would take care of us.
you promised that we would go with you. - Things have changed, Goldy.
fuck that. I'm gonna tell everybody, shithead.
we're comin', or you're gonna have a big fuckin' riot on your hands.
okay, okay. I'll take you, all right? I'll give you a million, cash.
a million? We talked about five percent of the net.
you owe me millions, not a million.
you're a technician, below the line. You don't get back end.
I don't get a- You motherfucking piece of
don't, don't! Stop!
stop! Please, no. Don't!
Congratulations. You won.
you're free.
enjoy your new life.
Hey!
don't take the piss.
Where's my fuckin' money?
you should be happy with what I'm giving you. You're a free man.
I give you a good show, I win it...
you make me a free man.
me and you, we had a deal.
the deal is whatever I want it to be.
you won 'cause I let you win.
keep him here. I'll be right back.
what's goin' on? - Sit tight.
don't touch me.
I'll be right back.
got a spare smoke?
good man. Can I have a light?
shut up, you ugly bitch! Shut your fucking mouth!
one of you fucking twitches, I will blow you away!
startin' with you, four eyes.
where is he?
where is he? - I don't know.
fuck!
God will not help you! I can help you!
shut up! You! You fucking coward!
shut up!
get some fucking order in here! Where are you fucking going?
now, have I got your fucking attention?
don't move, redneck.
thank you for the show.
the show ain't over yet.
I'm gonna kill you.
I'm gonna kill you too, sweetheart.
Yeah, whatever, you fuckin' hillbilly.
get up.
get up!
look me in the eyes.
do you enjoy watchin' all this?
do ya?
I'm sorry.
it's too late.
sit.
Yeah.
take it easy, Yank.
I didn't volunteer for this.
no one got nothing they didn't deserve.
I certainly didn't want to fight you.
bullshit.
it's not bullshit.
the military- they sent me to every hell hole on this fuckin' earth...
just to do their killin'.
four years in an African prison...
takin' it up the ass twice a day by the fuckin' natives.
sounds like you had a hard life.
Yeah.
good thing it's over.
get us out of here now!
fly the fucking thing!
shit!
lt stopped.
what's that, Dave?
nothing.
how we doing?
Oh, we're ready.
you feeling the magic?
Oh, l'm feeling the magic, all right.
let's hit 'em.
Yeah.
let's do it.
here we go.
let's hit 'em.
let's go make $30 million.
good morning.
before l begin, let me...
l'll go get help.
Jesus. Jesus, David.
phone 90101 . phone 90101 !
okay, it's okay.
lt's okay.
everybody else off the bus.
sound waves.
so, if we know that sound waves gain wavelength and lose frequency as they travel through more dense materials...
...then the anomalies in these waves are the means by which we can surmise the fundamental architecture of our planet.
how are the nails coming, Christine?
good.
all right, let's have a demonstration.
Mr. Acker, Veronica.
thank you very much.
all right.
Mrs. Limestone, being a big softie, you know, loves walks in the park, bedtime stories, big romantic.
loves Chet.
l can't play Chet, but l'll see what l can do.
watch the oscilloscope, all right?
here we go.
Dr. Joshua Keyes?
maybe.
yes or no, sir?
the first one.
please come with us, sir.
guys, wh0what's going on?
we don't know, sir.
what do you mean, you don't know?
your security clearance is higher than ours.
l have security clearance?
we're just here to bring you to your jet.
Hey, Serge.
Ah!
Damn!
lt's about time. You're always late.
let's keep moving, gentlemen.
what am l doing here?
they wouldn't brief me until you got here.
you know, there are biochemists everywhere, military.
l hate them.
when are you going to meet a nice girl and bring her for dinner?
l'm married to my work.
so am l.
which makes my wife my mistress...
that's why l'm still in love with her.
you were always a romantic.
l love my wife.
Yeah, l know. l love your wife, too.
l know.
but l don't love your wife. You know what l mean.
you don't love her the same way, you know.
lt's the French. l think it's the cheese.
Ah, the cheese.
you're... you're teasing me, right?
Oh, my...!
whoa. Wait, these are bodies.
l think we're in the wrong place here.
Yeah, we're in the wrong place.
no. lf you were in the wrong place, you would've already been shot.
that's a hell of a greeting.
serge. Yes. Always a pleasure.
same here, Thomas.
Dr. Keyes.
0l know. Tom Purcell.
gentlemen, you do realize that everything here is totally classified, okay?
at 10: 30 a. m. local time, 32 civilians, all within a 10 block radius...
died.
they didn't get sick first.
they simply hit the ground dead.
nerve agent?
our first guess. No.
they all died at the same time?
as far as we can tell, to the second.
this hits CNN in one hour.
l need a reason.
ls there a variation in sex, age, body type?
they all had pacemakers.
under a minute.
your reputation is well deserved.
0Hey, hey, hey. 0How did you guess?
without any clues from the victims?
no, that's...
serge and l are the clues.
l mean, he specializes in high energy weapons.
l do geomagnetics.
so calling us means you suspect an electromagnetic pulse weapon.
lf these are the only fatalities, they must be people susceptible to...
electronic interference.
qed pacemakers.
you're spooky sometimes, eh?
now l need to know, did some sort of weapon kill these people?
the power that you would need to create an EM pulse strong enough...
l mean, that's... that's not a weapon that l've ever heard of. No.
okay, we're done.
we're not done, sir.
there's nothing on the other side of the equal sign.
l agree with Joshua...
thank you.
our greatest concern was this may have been an act of war, but since it's not, l think we can all breathe a little easier, can't we?
look at my hat.
what is it, sweetheart?
lt's okay, son.
these things happen all the time and...
let's, go, let's go! Come on!
watch out, you bloody idiot!
Hurry! Run!
daddy!
the skies are empty over Nelson's Column now, but a few hours ago, it was a different story.
eyewitnesses claimed that the frenzied swarms of birds were not in fact attacking people deliberately...
and it's not just this time. No, no, no, no, no, no.
but seemed to be confused and flying blind.
the Fortean Times reported violent bird swarms twice last month in Australia and Japan.
five people are confirmed dead and dozens injured in the panic that followed the bizarre and terrifying incident in London's historic Trafalgar Square.
0Weird. 0Mm0hmm.
quite strange, also.
Mm. Strange, indeed.
Mm!
how do birds navigate?
by sight?
no, no, no, the long range stuff.
magnetic fields.
little ions in their brains align with the magnetic field of the Earth.
Yeah, what she said. Right?
acker.
hit the 'Net, do a search for...
Oh, two years ought to do it.
any and all, like, " weird news " , you know...
bizarre animal migrations, specifically birds.
whale and dolphin beachings.
unusual atmospheric phenomenon, unexplained plane crashes, you know, just use your imagination.
that is a huge search.
you can use our T01 line to look up Sailor Moon crap.
you're up to this.
Danni, Danni, get me the brightest kids from the Field Theory Class, and design a computer model of an electromagnetic field.
what are we doing?
l need a 30D computer model of the Earth to lay the field over.
Whoa0ho0ho, the planet Earth?
Yeah, the planet Earth. You know, the pretty blue one.
map out the anomalies that Acker finds and grunt out the equations.
and, uh...
grab those smelly kids from the Non Linear Diff class, too.
listen, Josh, do we even have time for this?
do this and l'll sign your doctorates blindfolded.
0Blindfolded? 0Blindfolded.
do not pass Go. Go directly to PhD.
be wrong. Be wrong.
Tim, l'm coming in a little hot.
give me some drag, will you?
Roger that.
we are in attitude and ready for an entry interface.
nice work, Major.
l have the controls now for E. I.
l could take us in.
you could...
but you won't.
l'm ready for this, Bob.
Oh, no, you're not, Beck.
you're trained, and you're certified doesn't make you the commander.
and the commander lands the bird.
you got to be the youngest person ever in space.
you should say, thank you, be happy.
now.
endeavour, Houston, at this time we show you go for reentry.
Houston, Endeavour descending through 400, 000 feet coming upon entry interface.
endeavour, this is Flight.
weren't able to annoy the commander into letting you bring her in this time?
that's a negative, Stick.
l'll have to be more annoying next time.
ls that even possible?
endeavour, we see you in good entry config.
Roger, Houston.
advise.
l'm seeing those plasma trails now.
all right, mark 241/2.
so, a minute to air.
l don't believe in belts.
just get me through the Earth's atmosphere in this spaceship.
COM dropout.
start the I Com.
let's wait till the...
COM restored.
quiet!
we are out of position here.
guidance shows us on energy and on course.
well, l've made this approach 213 times in the simulator.
we're not where we should be.
where the hell are we?
endeavour, guidance is bad.
you are now 102 niner miles off course.
Roger, Houston. We sort of noticed.
ls that...?
Los Angeles. That is confirmed.
we are 105 thousand feet.
we got maybe two minutes of glide time left.
doesn't make sense.
the guidance, the beacons are all wrong?
we're heading straight for downtown.
we're not going to crash into Los Angeles.
they're going to hit downtown L. A.
at 300 knots.
Bob, you know L. A? Because l have an idea.
Houston, those buildings are getting mighty big.
can you clear a freeway?
okay, thank you.
come on. Come on.
lt's rush hour, Commander, and it's bumper0to0bumper.
sir, l have an alternate.
lf you turn to heading 10705...
lt's Houston's call. Houston?
computers are still plotting.
come on.
Houston, we are running out of time here.
sir, l have an alternate.
all right, Beck, what do you got?
Houston, l have coordinates for an alternate landing site.
can you confirm?
endeavour, give them to me.
l show possible touchdown... at 33. 55 north, 1 18. 10 west.
bill?
lt's theoretically possible.
endeavour, that is confirmed.
turn right, heading 10705.
expect visual contact with Los Angeles River in five seconds.
no, that will not work, Houston.
we got bridges every few hundred yards.
our wingspan alone is going to fold us up.
l've figured the " L " over " D " max.
we can make it if you can bring us straight in.
we're coming in high and hot.
290 feet, 320.
270, 30005... Arm the gear.
you're armed.
gear down. Now.
gear in transition.
240 feet, 290.
hang on. This isn't going to be subtle.
210 feet, 265.
get out of the way! Move!
Derotate.
lnward.
speed brakes!
100%.
Oh, we're way too fast.
deploy the chute.
no. We'd snag the bridge. We'll tear the tail off.
banking right.
commander, that next bridge!
watch it!
we're way too high for that one!
suck up the gear!
not yet. We'll lose all steering.
we hit, it's over!
and... gear up now!
lock your harnesses. This is out of my hands.
let's get out of here!
run! Let's get out!
Dr. Zimsky?!
will you make sure my assistant has your number, darling?
sure.
0Dr. Zimsky! 0Hello.
l'll call security.
no, it's all right. lt's all right. Hello.
thank you, sir.
0Dr. Zimsky. 0Yes. What's your name?
no, sir, l don't need you to sign it.
l need you to read that.
l'm sorry, l don't have time.
0l'm late for the White House. 0Sir, please.
l need you to confirm my results, sir.
young man, do you have any idea who l am?
Yes, l do, sir. Please read this.
what's it about?
lt's the end of the world.
no, l... this is impossible. l'm sorry.
l0l0l can't have missed this.
You0You have to be wrong.
l mean, look, l'm sure with careful comparison to my own work, we'll find that you are mistaken.
no offense, but...
well, l mean, we'll know soon enough.
the bigger effects will start up any day now.
only you and Dad ever call me that.
well, Beck.
so, what brings you to sunny D. C?
the Board of Review is next week.
just trying to get a sense of the mood upstairs.
how bad is it?
your crew crashed the space shuttle.
now, how good do you think it could be?
sir, this is my life.
well...
l was studying for the academy when l was 13.
lt still is and has always been my life.
lt's over.
lt's over, Rebecca.
l'm sorry.
lt's right down here.
Really?
lt's like the 14th of July.
what the hell's the hurry here?
Rebecca, would you excuse me, please?
excuse me.
Thomas, um, look...
it seems that destiny may have caught up with us.
did Zimsky really try to give you his autograph?
Ah, Monsieur Zimsky.
Herr Zimsky.
superstar.
Oh...
l think l skipped drunk.
went right to hangover.
weren't you the one?
l spoke with the kids.
they don't sleep at night.
they look at the sky, and... and they think it's pretty.
ls there any chance you're wrong?
no. The sky, man.
the sky00 l mean, that's just the beginning.
that's high altitude static discharge.
l know.
Dr. Keyes...
...your presence is required at the Pentagon.
Ah... it's my best buddies.
Hey!
why don't you join us for a drink?
we'd be grateful if you could join us for a ride, sir.
and if l were to say no?
just asking. Yeah.
well, we have no sense of humor.
that's true.
Oh...
and we're armed.
thank you.
Dr. Keyes, welcome.
thank you.
Dr. Zimsky informs us that you made a useful contribution to his investigations, so he wanted you to assist him in the briefing.
that's very generous of you, Dr. Zimsky.
science is a selfless business, dear boy.
now, why don't you begin, and l'll fill in all the difficult bits.
all right, l'll put this as simply as l can.
everybody on Earth is dead in a year.
and let me explain why.
wrapped around the Earth is an invisible field of energy.
lt's made up of... electricity and magnetism, so it's called00 creatively enough00
the electromagnetic field.
lt's where we get our magnetic North Pole and South Pole, and it protects us from cosmic radiation.
so this EM field is our friend.
but now...?
but now, that field is falling apart.
Why?
Why?
this here.
does somebody have a can of air freshener?
quick and dirty.
the thin skin, that's the Earth's crust.
that's what we live on.
lt's 30 miles thick.
the meat here, call it the mantle.
and forgetting all the the funky transitions, it's 2, 000 miles thick.
the core, the peach pit in the center... that's a tricky one.
there's two parts00
the inner core and the outer core.
are you following me?
the inner core is, uh...
well, it's a big, solid chunk of iron, we think.
and that's surrounded by the outer core, and that is liquid.
Yes, but, most importantly, this liquid is constantly spinning in one direction.
so a trillion trillion tons of hot metal spinning at a thousand miles an hour, so...
right, so Physics 10100
hot metal moving fast makes an electromagnetic field.
this spinning liquid outer core is the engine that drives the EM Field.
and that's where we have our problem.
this engine has stalled.
the core of the Earth has stopped spinning.
how could this have happened?
we don't know.
what's the timeline here?
as the EM Field becomes more and more unstable, we'll start seeing isolated incidents.
one plane will fall from the sky, and then two, and then...
in a few months, anything...
everything electronic will be frie
static discharges in the atmosphere will create super storms with hundreds of lightening strikes per square mile.
after that, it gets bad.
the Earth's EM Field shields us from the solar winds, which are a lethal blend of radioactive particles and microwaves.
when that shield collapses, microwave radiation will literally cook our planet.
Dr. Zimsky.
this is the Sun.
this is the Earth... without the EM Field.
would you?
mm0hmm.
three months, gentlemen, and we're back in the Stone Age.
a full year, the field collapses...
and that.
may l?
feel free to throw up. l know l did.
so, how do we fix it?
we can't.
not in my vocabulary.
then you might want to get one of those
word A Day calendars, General, because it's impossible.
the core is the size of Mars.
you're talking about jump starting a planet.
this is a superheated hyper fluid of molten iron and nickel at 9, 000 degrees Fahrenheit, 2, 000 miles down, 1 , 000 miles thick.
and the deepest we've ever been is... seven miles with a two inch drill bit.
lf we can go into space, we certainly...
well, space is easy.
lt's empty.
we're talking about millions of pounds of pressure per square inch.
even if we somehow came up with a brilliant plan to fix the core, we just can't get there.
Yes, but...
...what if we could?
Hello, Braz.
why the hell aren't you dead yet?
okay, this way.
well, that went better than l expected.
Dr. Brazzleton, l see you know Dr. Zimsky.
Yeah.
20 years ago, he stole my research.
after that, we0we kind of lost touch.
research that was equally mine.
that's funny, l don't remember a check from any of the patents.
all right, Braz.
20 years in the desert makes you a prophet and a martyr.
look, we're here about your legendary ship.
okay, l'm combining high frequency pulse lasers with resonance tube ultrasonics.
lf you've ever seen ultrasonic waves break up a kidney stone on the Discovery Channel, it's the same deal here.
you can... put your helmets on now.
firing.
okay, l'm officially impressed.
so, all right.
so you've made some progress with the engine, we'll grant you.
have you begun to think about a shell?
okay, this is Alex.
okay, Alex. Good.
okay, here we have a concrete block, and in back of that, we have a two0inch steel plate.
okay. We're ready.
and we are... firing.
that's...
that's impossible.
l combined the crystals in a tungsten0titanium matrix at supercool temperatures, and that's what did the trick.
the applications for this are just...
what do you call this material?
well, its real name has 37 syllables.
l call it Unobtainium.
mm0hmm.
the Unobtainium will take the heat and the pressure and transform it to energy, which in turn, reinforces the shell of the ship, you see.
so the hotter and the deeper she gets, the stronger she gets... theoretically.
Theoretically?
theoretically, yes.
this... is Johnson, don't mind him.
this is the prototype for the cockpit here.
excuse me, Dr. Brazzleton, when do you think the ship will be operational?
when l get my fabrication methods perfected...
12... ten years, ten years.
what would it take to get it done in three months?
$15 billion. l...
will you take a check?
why don't you use a credit card? You get miles.
Mm.
shit!
Mr. Finch, this is the FBI. We have a warrant.
purge!
come on, purge!
FBl! Freeze!
okay.
l know these look like computers.
totally not.
Carnegie0Mellon University. M. I.T.

63 computer fraud indictments.
64
two convictions.
this is strike three, Mr. Finch.
wait a second.
you guys aren't here to whack me, are you?
because l was really, really hoping to have sex before that happened.
Yeah. l've been told by the FBl whose database you crippled last year00
that you are the best in the business.
so you're about to be given a choice.
what if l say no?
excuse me, but is this really the best we could do?
l mean...
how many languages do you speak?
five, actually.
well, l speak one.
one, zero, one, zero, zero.
with that, l could steal your money, your secrets, your sexual fantasies, your whole life, any country, any place, anytime l want.
we multitask like you breathe.
l couldn't think as slow as you if l tried.
do you have any idea...?
okay, hey. Hey!
let's just, let's give the kid a break.
okay, it's a phone.
lt's just a phone.
rat, we got a big problem.
a lot of people are going to die.
we need your help.
what kind of help?
lnformation control.
we need you to control the flow of information on the lnternet.
you're dreaming. Nobody controls the 'Net.
could you... with unlimited resources?
you want me to hack the planet?
he wants me to hack the planet.
you've got free long distance on that phone... forever.
okay.
lf l decide to do this...
l'm going to need an unlimited supply of Xena tapes and Hot Pockets.
hot Pockets?
they help me concentrate.
sounds fair.
major Childs, they're ready for you.
major Childs, a clarification:
you and you alone were responsible for proposing the descent vectors for the shuttle, correct?
Yes, General.
we have determined that the Class " A " landing mishap experienced by the Shuttle Endeavour was caused by biased navigational data from the ground due to a brief geomagnetic disturbance.
major Childs, the resourcefulness you showed in determining the descent vectors proved that you have exceptional navigation skills.
you've brought much credit upon yourself, the space program and the United States Air Force.
congratulations, Major.
you are reassigned with Commander Iverson and Flight Director Stickley to a new mission effective immediately.
transportation is waiting outside.
good luck and Godspeed, Major.
are you sure you want to wear this tie?
Why?
l don't know.
l mean, you look so nervous about it.
you look so...
so, how are you holding up?
Oh, hi. l'm good, l'm good.
l'm about to tell a couple hundred people the world is going to end.
well...
l've had better days.
you look good.
well, no, you don't look good.
why did he touch his tie like that?
Thomas, let me speak with you for a moment.
listen, wouldn't you rather l did this?
l mean, given my reputation, l think that...
no. No, Keyes is in the lead here, Zimsky.
Yes. Thomas, this is the most important scientific operation in history.
and given my status, l feel that it's my job to present...
project Destiny was your job, Zimsky.
and you went way beyond authorized limits.
and let me tell... And let me tell you, l still, l want to know if Destiny caused this problem.
lt's highly unlikely, but it may be the solution.
now, l have not finished checking...
excuse me.
Rebecca... l'm so glad l was wrong.
right over left...
no, the other left, the other left.
0Gentlemen. 0And then you...
gentlemen.
commander lverson, Major Childs, this is your crew:
Dr. Brazzleton knows the ship;
hello.
Dr. Zimsky knows the planet;
doctor.
Dr. Leveque knows the weapons system;
excuse me, ladies first.
and Dr. Keyes...
Dr. Keyes built the navigation system, so...
Hi. Rebecca Childs.
these are your fellow... fellow... what?
Terranauts?
hello.
all this brain power over here is starting to smell like burning batteries.
y'all better come and join in.
Yeah.
lt's the simplest things that are the hardest, huh?
Yeah. lt's official.
l'm the least0qualified person on this base.
Dr. Keyes, l'm sure the people in charge have every confidence in you.
well, the problem is that l'm in charge.
Yeah, l know.
can l help you?
Yes, please.
you're an astronaut, and you can tie a Windsor?
mm0hmm.
ls there anything you can't do?
not that l'm aware of.
l find that incredibly intimidating.
Yep. Most people do.
here.
thank you.
you're welcome.
let me introduce our project leader, Dr. Joshua Keyes.
thank you, thank you.
good evening. Good evening.
Wow. This looks like a meeting for Nobel Prize Winners Anonymous.
l know you are all the finest in your fields and have come a long way to be here.
so, l'll outline our program over the next three months.
Dr. Brazzleton will supervise the building of a ship which is capable of reaching the center of our planet.
once there, it will deliver an explosive charge large enough to restart its core.
Dr. Zimsky will calculate the scale of the explosion needed.
this is a program l designed to simulate the effect of nuclear detonations on the core.
lf my calculations are correct, a tiny nudge in any direction will force the core back into its normal flow.
what's a " tiny nudge " in planetary terms?
a thousand megatons, give or take?
tops. Because any more than that would create a core instability.
we made a few monster warheads in the 200 megaton range.
Braz, do you think the ship can handle five of these babies?
Yeah. l can enlarge the ejection pod...
forgive me, but, you know, l know l'm not the expert here, but what if the core is thicker or thinner?
l mean, what if it's not what you think it is?
lsn't that going to affect the way the explosions are...?
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
and what if the core is made of cheese?
this is all best guess, Commander.
that's all science is, is best guess.
so my best guess is you don't know.
with luck, irony will break for the good guys for once, and the world's biggest weapons of mass destruction will help save the world.
the ship will be powered by a small experimental nuclear reactor.
lt will be divided into six compartments like cars on a train:
the locomotive unit, navigation compartment, living quarters, engineering, bomb compartment and finally the weapons0control module.
up to a 45 degree angle, every compartment will be held level by these gyro control gimbals.
but if we do breach a section, bulkhead doors engage automatically, seal off the section in red, and eject.
ls ejection really the best option?
only option.
each damaged compartment degrades the entire hull.
the objective is simple.
the obstacles are gigantic.
we're going to need all the help in the world, but if we are to avoid panic and chaos, the world at large can never know what's happening here.
which is where our friend Mr. Rat comes in.
lt's called Virus bot.
lt's a computer virus that will seek out files anywhere on the Web that contain keywords that we designate and wipes them out.
this is my Kung0Fu, and it is strong.
meanwhile, there are a million puzzles ahead of us, and we have three months to solve them.
we have a committed and ingenious team.
we have every resource available to us, and we have the best of the world's scientific and technical talents on our side.
with your help we can, we must... succeed.
feedback in the resonance tube.
talk to me, gentlemen.
we are losing structural integrity.
no, it's not feedback.
lt's an impeller malfunction, l believe.
no, it's not, no. lf it were an impeller malfunction...
for God's sakes, Braz, make the call!
no, l'll make the call. l should make the call.
65 knots.
depth, 805 thousand feet.
look, guys...
lt's a disaster!
what part of " talk to me " don't you guys understand?
for the 22nd time in a row, everyone on Earth is dead.
let's take a little quiet time, and you all are going to try this again.
Hi.
Hi.
what is this?
well, it's... l invented it.
lt's how you're going to... going to steer underground.
lt's, um...
not very good reception.
well, you're looking through three feet of lead at 50 yards away, so...
it ain't bad.
lt's like a CAT scan at a hospital, but it's0it's souped0up.
l invented it for Deep Earth surveying.
and then the government came in, bought my research, paid off my student loan guys and made me a consultant.
l'm sorry, this is really delicate.
and l have it just the way l want it.
so... excuse me.
uh, yeah.
then they brought me in when the pacemakers quit, and... boom00 you know, l'm Apocalypse Boy.
apocalypse Boy?
Yeah. l'm having T0shirts made up.
well, hats sell better.
you know, it's funny, because that is...
right where it should be.
well...
l'm sorry. l'm a little ragged around the edges.
l'm just trying to get this thing to focus correctly.
this is really cool, but can l just...?
well... mm0hmm.
lt's better. lt's better. Uh...
God, l hate this sky.
crashing one ship isn't enough for you?
Hey. Practice makes perfect.
you can practice all you like.
lt doesn't mean you're ready to sit in that seat.
so you keep reminding me, sir.
you know, l doubt you're even going to listen to this, but l'm going to give it a shot.
being a leader isn't about ability.
lt's about responsibility.
got it, sir.
no, you don't, Beck.
l mean, you're not just responsible for making good decisions.
you have to be responsible for the bad ones.
you got to be ready to make the shitty call.
what makes you think l'm not?
because you're so good.
you haven't hit anything you couldn't beat.
l mean, hell, you were the one who figured out how to save the shuttle.
you made me, you made the rest of NASA just look like an ass.
lt's just that you're used to winning...
...and you're not really a leader until you've lost.
$20 billion has been spent developing this system...
Oh, come on, guys, the chefs at NASA...
l want wine! l need wine!

Uh0oh. Rome does not look good.
this planet is decaying faster than we thought.
lt's just the start.
soon they'll be EM spikes and microwaves will break through the weak spots and...
all right. Get this ship in the ground. Now.
Ah! Summer in the Pacific.
Yeah, the world is inside out.
l was saving this for later, but...
this is the time for...
Josh, do you mind?
no, not at all. Yeah.
we should have a name for this baby.
Oh, she's called Virgil, actually.

that's it.
that's appropriate, l guess.

our shit fertilizes the rice paddies and fields
that's why the farmer pays money to buy it from the rich landlord, who owns this tenement

you mean, rice cakes come from shit?
well, not quite, but you're not far off, either
useless, it's damp!
that's a fine sum Don't be stingy with those rice cakes
save that line for when you ve paid your rent
and l don't recall letting a room to that prancing idiot beside you l'll work hard for lots of rice cades next year

I ll strike him with all my might and if that's not sufficient,
I ll tade my life gracefully just lide the cherry blossoms
that's the warrior's way of death
this, my father taught me
one rainy night last spring, the man who lived here, was ruined and decided to end it all
he got as far as slashing his wife's throat, but then his only kid turned on him and stabbed him
hearing the noise l rushed over, this place was a sea of blood

time deeps passing by and l haven't yet told him the truth
what does that say?
no tabs
what's a tab?
a tab? A tab means. .
you want to eat now but pay later
sada san's always asking for that
actually, he never, ever pays his tabs, so we call someone like him " a deadbeat'
how do you write run out on debts?'
deadbeat?
the way you write it. .
you write " step out . . .
with ' on your debts "
means ' run out '
let's try that again
abacus and WritIng Lessons
clear the abacus for the next calculation. .
that's 7 pence
eight pence
five pence
two pence
three pence lf you're going to teach, why not teach swordfighting?
what s the point in a world with no more war? Idiot
but a samurai teaching the abacus?
got nothing to do with avenging. .
as they say, " Hunger is a terrible master. . .'
hunger's the master
the point is, a man doesn't need to read if he's got the guts to fight
as they say here, " Only the countrymen deep their money "
we spend our money as soon as we made it. Who needs calculations?
you're not even from around here
you re in the way, move
what do you want in there?
Soza san to teach me how to write
you, too?
at least l'll learn how to write my own name
you have no guts You should learn, too
damn it
my own name " my ass!
l'll never write a single word, until the day l die
everyone finished?
can you believe Kenbo's learning to write?
he's smart and good looking
good bye
see you tomorrow
clinic lsn't he going to inherit the martial arts academy?
Yes, his father was a grand fencing master
a samurai teaching kids to write. .
lt s not right
you. . should investigate
he may be have ties to Kira l warned you about this
even scattered, it s risk y with too many of us in town
all right Not to worry, it's nothing
though l can't heal much more than this
Soza san, is this the first time you' ve met Kichiemon?
yes l'm Kichiemon
I m Aodi Soza-emon
Soza san has come from up north, to avenge his father l see
revenge, huh. . .
lt's been over two and a half years now, with no leads. .
two and a half years, l m sorry
but why here? Any special reason?
these places often shelter strangers
a good place to seed my enemy. . .
strangers?
master Aodi, what do you do for fun?
fun?
my pleasures are. . . bathing and. . .
l also deep birds And l like to play Go
Kichiemon also enjoys Go Why not challenge each other?
Yes, an excellent plan
over a game of Go. . .
yes lt was at a Go tournament " You' ve called halt four times " ' No, it's only three, " that s how it began " You're just an idiot, how dare you call me a liar! Draw! "
l'm so sorry
he always longed to die at war
dying over a silly dispute
must have been a shame
at least. . .
lf he had died in a manner more worthy of a warrior. . .
one moment l' ve always been. . .
handy this way
that's all for today, Soza san
so l stand at 7 wins, 3 losses Do come back
welcome
don't stare
done yet?
not yet
tell me when you're done
I hope it's a lot
a lot, a lot
a lot, a lot
revenge?
that's right lt s just a play
a play?
this'll be your first
every spring festival, Shigehachi writes a script and we stage a revenge play
despite his loods, this guy's smart
despite my loods. .
l' ve got more confidence in my brains than my guts
same goes for me
the crowd paid us well last year
osae san looked so pretty in her costume
osae san, too?
they only love our show so much, half aware it's a farce, because real fights are so scarce
we made money. . .
thanks to those cowardly Adou ronin who can t avenge their Lord
did they beat you up, Shinbo?
no
what then?
they made fun of me
how?
they said l live like a pig in a rubbish heap
what the hell?
and that everyone who lives here is trash
who the hell said that?
don t get so upset, they're just kids
besides, they're right
they said " why bother buying trash, just sell your own "
that d be me
got that right
what s wrong with my work?
bring the brat here I ll beat the shit outta him
hurry up, bring the brat
Soza san
teach me to use a sword l really want to beat them
sounds great Teach him, Soza
act like a samurai for once
my father made me promise no fighting outside the academy
that s pretty useless l ll teach you
come here
hold this
grab this tight Hold it in front of your belly
hold it really straight
lift it straight up and. . . bring it down
what s going on here?
Shinbo s practicing vengeance
for the play?
no, the genuine article
swing it down hard And shout
oto san What would you do in his place?
l'd learn how to take a punch without getting hurt
how's that?
let em hit you where it doesn't hurt and call it quits
who taught you that pathetic trick?
my dad, before he died
what a legacy!
your mom s a real terror. .
Yup, it's come in real handy. Thands, Dad
don't force it
give it here Hold this, straight, straight
when you're ready to strike. .
that s it
Shinbo, come on, hit me like you mean it
Hey, that's dangerous
come and get me, crybaby
you want to win, right?
listen lt's no good swinging like that useless Lord Adou
swords are made for thrusting
got it? Try it
that's right, that's good
aim at their knees and ankles, where it s hard and it ll hurt
that's cheating. . .
say, noble samurai
why don't you come after me?
l think not lt s childish to take on an amateur
no need to worry l want to show Shinbo, fencing learned in a dojo, is useless in reality
find any fish?
watch out!
Mago!
he's useless. .
cheater
listen up, Shinbo
this way, they'll never bother you again lf that's not your style, get that guy to show you how to take a punch without getting hurt
somebody. . . look after Soza san
Hey, there's a sudden chill in the air
daddy, you're home!
lt s spinning
it's caught
you're right
other way
this time the other way - Welcome home - Thanks
what's that?
lt was just lying there
someone was in a hurry l m home, baby
can you hear?
hirano san. . .
are you all right?
do you have a stomach ache?
hirano san. . .
Hey, Sada san!
look what a mess you make of the floor The landlord won't like this
get a doctor, quick!
he'll be fine, it's the third time And the sword's bamboo
he tries to commit hara-kiri every spring - Pathetic - Ouch
listen, if you do this on the floor, it's a pain in the neck to clean up lf you must, do it on the dirt floor
answer me
Oh, no!
Soza san, please get Dr. Onodera
Soza san
what a bunch of hopeless losers. .
bamboo. . .
osae san. . .
Thandk you l could ve sworn he was taller
enough of your stories
give me the money
money?
Oh, hello
pick it up
sada san l'm grateful
what for? l was in the mood for something sweet
actually, Sada san
why so serious, suddenly?
l' ve already found him. . . kanazawa Jubei
changed his name
Heisude, right?
he's a laborer in Kawaracho
that widow he s living with is a beauty - You knew! - Yeah, l dnew - Since when? - For a while - But you. . - Listen
have you told anyone else yet?
then let's keep it secret
in this day and age, this samurai revenge thing's out of style
besides, with your skills, you're doomed
think l can have another?
another, please
so, sell any?
not this crap
welcome home, Soza san
another day
off to the bath with Sada? Treat me, sometime
wish l'd get a good job
tried buying scraps?
no way!
Why?
stinks
figured
what do you see, Mago?
I see night
say, Soza san
what will happen to your bird?
l wonder. . .
ls he stuck underground forever?
lt's dark and it s cold and he won't like it
I wonder if my father's underground somewhere
Shinbo. . .
don't tell my mother
she still thinks he's going to come home
sure
let's pray again, that your father s some place warm
on his deathbed, my father held my hand and begged, ' Soza, please avenge me "
but l m a hopeless swordsman, and haven't fulfilled this task
his one dying wish
that is my inheritence lnheritence?
yes lt s why I have to pay back his enemy with my own hands ls that true?
l can understand your feelings, but this is how l see it lf, after living his whole life, your father left you nothing but hate, it would be unbearably sad
mother, come
owing to my imminent starvation, ' l pray you will send funds ' upon receipt of this letter
may l inquire, Father, ' whether you are happy and healthy?
hope you will take ' the very best care of yourself " Yours, Sakutaro "
that's what it says
so, how will you reply?
reply?
l have no reply
what, a samurai?
so spoilt
you have no skills l wouldn t be so proud if l were you
what s the big deal over those two swords you have?
the village dumpling-mader serves them three at a time
whenever he gets that drunk, he brings old letters in for me to read
he never once sent a reply, so he's bad for business. .
Soza san, why do you think samurai exist?
Why?
peasants grow rice
merchants sell things
just as that drunk said, samurai alone made nothing, and sell nothing
the samurai were meant to live, giving and taking life at war
time has passed and war is over
but the samurai remain l'd say that s the root of their troubles
say, that gives me an idea
will that lazy Oishi ever come to Edo?
that's why l deep saying
we should ve attacked the Kira mansion when they forced our lord into hara-kiri
but that chief retainer. . .
he's hopeless He and his son are both sex maniacs
the father chases female ass, the son chases male ass
old man Kira's retired now. . .
at this rate, he'll die of old age before we can dill him
onodera san, it s hardly the time for poetry
Oh, sorry
but there's nothing gained by panicking " A prayer for a despised enemy's " longevity "
revenge, revenge!
art thou Adiyama Gengobei?'
they re making a racket Are they trying to rub it in?
my son and l. . .
rain drenched and windswept. . .
the trials and. .
the trials and tribulations of such times. .
mocking the warrior s sacred vengeance
they won't get away with this " Now, fight and fight fair "
l cut my enemy down in warrior's vengeance, not petty motives " Now you deserve revenge "
listen, Soza This isn't the Kabudi
no need to over do it
and now, " Not so fast, just a little wait, please
that's my cue to step in and mediate
Hey, can l say the ' Not so fast ' line?
the part's way too much for you
do the best with your ' Revenge! ' part
for once, l want a big part
you re luck y to even get any lines ' lt is a day for admiring blossoms
can you face the gods if your swords draw blood among the temple-goers?
out of respect for me, won't you postpone this fight?
and if the enemy also does a little dance, the crowd will applaud
Soza san, excuse me l'd like to discuss something
what is it?
not here May l come to your place?
Oh, don't bother l won't stay long
please don't make a fuss
Ouch, ouch. . .
he's just sipping tea quietly
hurry up and jump her, man
despite his looks. . .
um. . .
l don't know if l should be asking you this. .
but it s too late to ask Shigehachi san. . .
um. . .
what do " Drifting log mokkI ' and " Udonge flower ' mean?
Moddi. . . you mean?
lt's one of my lines in the play, but l' ve never been able to figure out what it means
Moddi. .
l wonder how you write it. .
a mouki is. . .
the characters are ' blind' and ' turtle "
a turtle, worn out with swimming, finally rests refuge on a floating log
the ' udonge flower " blooms once every 3 thousand years
because the rare " udonge' flower resemble a spider web, " udonge ' has slowly come to mean the spider s web as well. . .
Moddi?
all done
Soza, don't be so nervous lt s just acting
how will you manage a real revenge?
cherry blossoms are blessed only when they have all fallen "
when it's time for a samurai to die, one hopes to fall gracefully, lide these cherry blossoms
made sure you do, on your fourth try ' Only the countrymen. . "
you're not from here, right?
l bet cherry blossoms fall gracefully 'cause they know they ll bloom next year
otherwise, they'd never give up
a point for Mago " Not exactly, but not far off, neither "
right, ' neither '
hunger is a terrible. . .'
you don't really understand any of it
a revenge! A revenge!
a revenge! A revenge!
how was l?
just fine
shit - What? - Some guys l d rather not see - What? A big tab? - Enormous l know, will you take my " Not so fast line, too?
me?
don t worry, you can do it
all to avenge this grudge, my son and l, ' rain drenched, windswept, ' by the trials and tribulations of such times. .
meeting you lide a mokkI reaching driftwood the flowering of the udonge. . . '
now fight, and fight fair "
l cut my enemy down in warrior's vengeance, not petty motives " Now you deserve revenge "
it's your moment!
what s the hold up?
hurry up
kill him
not so fast!
we ve heard she avenges her dead husband
in these peaceful times, a fine example of a warrior's wife
to ignore her plight would disgrace any samurai
an excellent chance to showcase our samurai training
though we may be inadequate, we offer our assistance
a gracious offer, but my son and l, must do this with our own hands. . .
listen, l ll strike both his arms - You, his legs. . . - Strike
once he's disabled, you deliver the deathblow
not so fast! "
so fast
how about taking his wife or child hostage?
l can t do that
set his house on fire and get him as he escapes. .
attack him in bed?
sada san
retribution must befit a samurai. . .
but if by some miracle you succeed, you'll win vast lands
there's got to be a way to avenge him without risking your life
are you taking this seriously?
l am
you sure? l don t think it's just that you re weak, you' ve got some other real hesitation about seeding revenge
Oh, I know
you' ve fallen in love with that beautiful widow
quite the stud, you widow-killer!
widow. . .'
Josh's vital signs are dropping.
what?
you're almost there.
you're almost there, Josh.
okay, guys, connect the oxygen.
Braz, you got that?
Yes. Connected!
good. l got to check these lasers.
okay, Beck, turn 'em over.
Pre-lasers only, if you don't mind.
lnitiating.
this better work.
the tide's really coming in.
Yes!
we got lucky-- l think we're going to swim right out of this one.
huh?
Braz, come on, it's over.
okay. Okay.
we're coming in.
Lnitiate start sequence.
Beck, do you hear me? -Careful.
start the impellers!
the door, open the door.
activate bulkhead doors!
now, Beck!
you okay? You're going to be weak.
you're okay.
good job, good job. Good man.
well done, well done.
l'm fine. Thank you.
so, um...
we have some good news, and, uh...
and we have some bad news.
uh, good news. l'll take good news.
all right.
well, we're alive and we're moving.
that's g... that's good news.
Oh, it is hot in here.
Yeah, that nitro we flushed out of the cooling system, it-it's causing things just to heat up a little.
l'm going to go back and just make some adjustments.
l'll lend you a hand.
all right. l'm fine.
l'm going to check your heartbeat, okay?
Thanks, Braz. Appreciate it.
so, that's the bad news?
that's not too bad.
no.
commander lverson died.
but...
we're living, and he would want to...
he'd want us to complete our mission, so l think that it's important that we all...
lt's all right.
thank you.
l'm sorry.
let's give him a second, okay?
he deserves that.
Oh, God, this all just seems too big, doesn't it?
l think you were attempting the impossible.
you were trying to save the world, and...
it's overwhelming.
l came here to save my wife and my two children and... six billion lives-- it's too much.
l just hope l'm-l'm smart enough and brave enough to save three.
you did a nice job, Joshua. Very nice. Great.
you'd have done the same thing.
well, maybe, maybe.
hey... who's steering the ship?
video screen autopilot.
l hope he knows the way.
you and me both.
so... you're really a college professor?
you're not from the ClA, or the NSA or any of those three-letter places?
no. l am a boring college professor.
wrong place, wrong place.
that was the bravest thing l've ever seen.
well, l just, l just...
listen, the lack of oxygen kept me from weeping like a little girl as is my custom in dangerous situations.
Hey, guys, we're close to the mantle core interface.
where are you?
key's in, Dr. Brazzleton.
ready.
we are in the...
okay, the code... 0-1-3-1-9-9-5.
...Luxurious, beautiful weapons control...
checking the controls on the nukes.
this is the birthday of my daughter.
ready? -Yeah.
thank you.
green. All green.
great. So we have to synchronize the babies now.
just a second.
there.
all right, now let's put them to bed.
Zimsky, could you please come up here for a second?
yes?
we're not supposed to go through anything black.
Yes, so please don't.
what is this?
they're scattered everywhere.
Oh, my God! They're diamonds!
great.
you might want to sit down and buckle up.
we're on a collision course here.
all rightie. Careful.
guys, we're dodging diamonds the size of Cape Cod, so bear with me.
not exactly nimble here.
diamonds? l want some.
can l help?
Ooh!
okay. lt's okay.
okay, it looks like we're in the clear.
guys! Weapons control, get out!
get out now!
Serge! What the hell are you doing?
come on!
my notebook!
now!
take the time reg, Joshua!
come on Serge! Come on!
my notes! You'll need them!
No!
God, no, Serge!
lt's okay.
Serge, come on! No!
come on, man!
leave the box! -We need the box!
we can get him! We can get him out!
hold on, Serge!
override the ejection system!
Beck, no! One damaged compartment threatens the whole ship!
override the ejection system!
Serge, we're right here.
we're not going to forget about you, man.
Josh, can you hear me? -Serge! Serge...
Hey, buddy, look in your monitor right now.
Serge, look in your monitor.
l'm right here. Serge...
Josh, l can't see you.
Braz is going to override the doors manually, okay?
we're working on it right now. Braz, how long?
going as fast as l can, fast as l can.
okay, l'm scared. -We're going right now.
shouldn't be two seconds, all right?
Beck, override the ejection systems, okay?
damn. l don't think Beck can hear me.
Serge, look at me now. Serge!
Serge, we're right here, okay?
we're not going to forget about you, man.
l'm going to get you out of here.
we're working on it, all right?
stay with me here. Okay?
l don't know what to do.
can you hear me now? All right, here l am.
l'm not going to let you go, man.
l'm not going to let you go, all right?
stay with me here, okay?
l'm going to come to Paris and we'll go out, all right? After this.
after this is all said and done, all right?
did you reset the overrides?
l never pushed them.
you let him die.
actually, you really want to know?
l killed him twice.
first when l hit the diamond, and then when l didn't hit the override.
do you want me to feel any worse about that than l already do?
lt's not possible.
why are you being so smug about that?
could you have made the decision?
Yes. -Could you?
Yes, l could've.
lf you would've hit that switch, l could've got him outta there!
l was yelling for you!
take it and look at it!
l was two inches from him!
l was two inches, and l told you to put the door up and you didn't!
l was screaming for you!
why didn't you do it?!
because l had to make that decision.
fate or God...
No!
damn it! You leave God out of this!
serge died so that we could complete our job.
Oh, that's right, the job of saving the world.
not the whole world, Josh! Just three of them.
Virgil, you are approaching core interface.
are you good to go?
Josh, can you hear me?
Josh, can you hear me?
ready as we'll ever be, Stick.
Dr. Keyes.
right here.
deep Earth, we are green and good to go.
we just got a huge speed jump.
we just got a huge speed jump.
we're at 95 knots.
our speed's jumped because the density of the core is different than our estimates.
lt's lighter than we thought.
so much for best guesses.
l'm fine with this.
at this rate, we'll, what
hit the inner core in a little over five hours.
l think we finally get some luck -Yeah. -Would you please punch the new core density into the equations for the nuclear detonation?
please tell me this is enough.
okay.
you're telling me the 1 , 000 megatons of nuclear warheads we hauled down here isn't going to cut it?
no. This core material is too thin.
what? -The energy waves from the explosion won't spread far enough.
they'll just bleed away into nothing.
that's it.
we go home. We go home.
home? -What?
our Commander is dead.
our weapons specialist is dead.
our weapons control systems are gone.
we don't know whether we can arm the nuclear devices, and our plan to fix the core no longer works. So...
we have failed.
we have not failed.
we have failed, and we go home, and we go to the alternative.
what alternative?
what are you talking about?
general, this is Dr. Conrad Zimsky.
destiny is a go.
repeat.
destiny is a go.
damn.
l need to know everything to do my job.
you don't have to know this.
general, it is my job to ensure the safety of this mission.
anything that affects it is my business.
now what the hell is Destiny?
lt's a device.
deep Earth Seismic Trigger lnitiative, DEST-lNl. Destiny.
we had reason to believe that our enemies were building a weapon that could generate targeted seismic events.
they would be able to create massive earthquakes under our territory.
no way of telling who did it.
so?
so... we built one, too.
mutually Assured Destruction.
a perfect acronym if ever there was one.
beautiful.
they built it first.
l built it better.
l beamed high-powered electromagnetic energy waves down Deep Earth
Zimsky, what makes you think that Destiny would even touch the core?
cause it already did.
this isn't a fluke.
we killed the planet.
you keep saying that the core is too big to be affected by anythiny short of nukes.
so... -The core is an engine.
throw a small wrench into a big engine, you can still stall it.
deep Earth, this is Virgil.
we require clarification on the status of Project Destiny.
why weren't we notified of this, sir?
because you didn't need to know, Major.
now you may not like this.
l may not like it either.
but it's my job, and l do it for my country, and if we don't develop these devices, someone worse will and they will use them against us.
but you have my word.
no one in this administration-- no one, had any idea that this could happen.
so the device that killed the planet is your backup plan?
an electric shock can stop a heart.
lt can certainly restart one.
destiny will work.
lt has to.
no, it won't work.
lf you fire that thing again with the core already stalled, it'll terminally destabilize it.
Yes, granted-- there is a marginal risk involved, but given the circumstances, l hardly see that there's an alternative.
no, Zimsky, listen to me.
every volcano on the planet will blow.
there'll be earthquakes big enough to rip us to pieces.
Dr. Keyes. -What?
l'm afraid it's all we've got.
now, l have orders from the president.
come home, Virgil.
we go to plan B.
well, what about plan C?
what? What?
well, plan C.
we continue on.
we restart the core... somehow.
we don't do it, you fire Destiny.
l can't wait for you to get out of there.
then don't. We fail, fire Destiny.
Oh, come on! That's ridiculous!
what choice do we have, -Zimsky? -Are you kidding me?
lf they set that thing off, the shock waves will wipe us out!
we'll be lucky to get back if we turn back right now!
Virgil, l'm telling you right now, we will fire Destiny, and we need to do so as quickly as possible, and if you're still there, you will be destroyed.
please don't make me have to do this.
plan C.
lt's your call, Commander.
majority decision.
we're going in.
l'm sorry, sir.
Oh, come on, you're a bunch of suicidal morons!
what are you, crazy?
plan C? Restart the core " somehow " ?
Oh, that's a great idea!
that's a brilliant idea!
l can't believe l'm stuck in this floating septic tank with you lunatics!
you may have nothing to lose.
you may have nothing to lose!
you may have nothing to lose but l have my life to lose, thank you very much while you're up!
now turn it around!
he told us to go back and we're going back!
Why? You want to be a hero? You want to be a martyr?
what do you want to be? You're out of your mind!
thank you! Turn it around!
No! -Zimsky.
you, shut up!
lt's not a stupid ship.
l had to.
lt had to happen sometime.
Yeah.
Oh...
status! What is that?
lt's the EM monitoring station.
lt's the one that tracks EM pulses.
God, no.
just talk, Mr. Rat.
that's a good boy.
remember those invisible microwaves that Josh was talking about?
well, they just found a hole.
no, it's a parking lot out here...
Oh, my God.
and now with this horrific breaking news, we go live to San Francisco, where Leo Jacks has the story.
Yes, Claire, it's hard to believe that half of San Francisco is in ruins today following the most devastating and the most baffling event in our nation's history.
lt's-it's a horrific situation here.
thousands are dead.
many are missing.
lt's-it's hotels, hospitals.
bring up the power grid.
the whole West Coast is out.
that means we're going to have to suck up just about every drop of juice east of the Rockies to fire Destiny.
another EM spike, we're not going to have enough power.
general, you have got to give them more time.
there is no more time.
Colonel, call Destiny.
l am launching a formal complaint against you with the Department of Defense.
rat to Josh.
go, Rat.
Hey, um...
here's the EM Field data that you're primed for.
digging that, Rat.
primed for.
primed for.
prime numbers
here we go.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
here we go, folks.
okay, this time it's going to work.
here you go... beautiful. Yeah, mm-hmm.
come on, baby.
come on, Daddy wants to see the sky again.
okay, okay, okay. Let's try again.
your torque is R, cross F...
no, your R is too small, Josh.
right.
wait, hold on.
what are you laughing at?
no, l mean, it took me and 400 of the world's smartest people to come up with the first plan.
you want to help?
no. l want to turn around and go home.
lt's not going to happen.
well, then we're going to die.
true.
all right, look, -let's start from square one. -Okay.
let's start from square one.
the bulk modules-- depends on density.
your torque is R cross F, but you have to integrate volume...
but here, here... just consider this.
now, we got this...
okay, now, R cross F, we're putting in pi. What's V?
Oh, for God's sake!
all right. l'm hitting him again.
no, no, no!
Braz, no, look, l have a theory.
are you interested?
Yes. We're interested.
then let me smoke a cigarette, and l'll tell you.
Oh, thank God.
hmm? All right, fine, look.
look, we have to use wave interference, okay?
because one explosion won't do it.
think about stones in a pond.
you drop a large stone into a pond, you get a big splash, and then that's it, it's over.
but drop a smaller stone, wait until the ripples weaken and drop another and another, and another,
the ripples reinforce each other in geometric progression.
hm, the whole bigger than the sum of the parts.
then we'll have five 200 megaton explosions...
lnstead of one big bang.
Yes.
we seed them through the core...
at locations that have to be accurate to the inch.
we detonate them in a sequence that has to be accurate then we outrun the biggest nuclear shock wave in history.
right.
Yeah.
l mean, that should be fairly simple.
destiny now should be diverting to the central.
final calibration on both transmission systems...
cut the... cut the rouge.
the red wire above the circuit.
okay. Okay.
no, no, wait, hold it!
l'm sorry, cut it below.
please...
extensions A, B.
here we go. -F, check.
lncrease power to reactors ten through 15
we're almost there, folks.
okay, guys we're closing on the inner core.
the nukes are ready. Timers are on.
great. Let's start dropping them.
no. The bombs are not built for these pressures.
that's why they were in that pod.
lf you send them out now...
out of that casing, they'll be crushed instantly.
l'm assuming we have a Plan D.
plan D is Virgil's compartments.
we put a nuke in each section of Virgil, and then eject the individual sections one at a time.
they should stay intact long enough for the nuke to go off.
Oh...
what?
Virgil's not designed to eject undamaged compartments.
okay, these are the ejection mechanisms holding each compartment in place.
they're all connected by one master hydraulic gear.
kind of like keys on a key ring.
what we have to do, we have to unlock the piston.
that will release the compartments so the bombs can be jettisoned.
Where's the master gear?
ln the crawl space we used to get out earlier.
well, what the hell is it doing there?
l built the ship in three damn months.
l didn't think l'd be intentionally sabotaging it. l'm sorry!
so one of us has to go in there.
correct.
lnto the crawl space that has core fluid at 9, 000 degrees.
Yes.
can you flush it with liquid nitrogen?
we don't have enough at this point.
9, 000 degrees.
and our suits are built to withstand...?
half that, probably.
right. Half that.
so what you're saying is whoever goes into that crawl space, is not coming back.
hmm.
together.
Yes, thank you.
wait.
on three. -Okay.
huh.
well, l better go on, get myself ready.
no, Braz, wait.
no, Braz, no wait. Excuse me.
just a moment, may l see that?
no. -May l?
may l?
Yes.
thank you.
magic.
l mean, Braz, three straws of equal length.
l mean, this is childish.
let's do it again.
no, we will not do it again.
l thought you'd be happy.
no. Not at the expense of you making us look like fools.
he's right. Why do you get dibs on being the hero?
because it's my damn ship.
Oh, that makes perfect sense.
look, for 20 years, l've done nothing but Virgil. 20 years.
Virgil belongs to me, and l will not let her fail.
l will not.
now if you want to know what's worth dying for
this ship.
building it instead of imagining it.
lf Virgil needs more blood, it will be my blood.
now l am going to go and get ready.
good to go.
lt's a hell of a boat you built, Braz.
l am really proud to have known you guys.
thank you.
Yes, Conrad?
you're right.
lt is your ship.
but l wish to God it had been ours.
the chamber's sealed, Beck.
ready.
open the hatch.
hang on, Braz.
come on, hang on.
manual override is complete!
Braz, we can still get you out of there.
no... start... start the impeller.
no.
we got a job to do.
let's do it.
let's go.
magnetic shielding systems are up.
magnetic shielding systems are up.
power level's 85%.
lncrease power to Reactor 10.
all personnel should be clear.
Oh, God!
Oh, l'm sorry.
okay, she's down.
approaching the first drop-off point.
we got to be accurate to the second here, boys.
and drop in three-five seconds.
and... timer on.
pull it.
clear... and...
ejecting.
all right. lnitiate firing sequence.
sir...
lt's our last shot, Stick.
damn you.
damn me? Too late.
what's that?
gotcha!
whoa, whoa, whoa!
someone's diverted our energy.
where the hell's it gone?!
lt looks like...
Coney Island.
your Kung Fu is not strong.
well, how long will it take to get it back online?
well, then get to it!
Oh, hey, General.
ls there something l can do for you?
timer on.
clear...
ejecting.
ejecting.
pull it.
all right.
let's go throw our last little 200 megaton stone in the pond.
l always wanted to make a splash in nuclear physics.
you know, that energy propagation stuff you were talking about...
Oh, that was high school physics.
Yeah, it's not exactly...
l just took the wavelengths from the core fluid off the MRl readings.
Yeah, and multiplied by 800...
we got to reset the timers!
reset the timers! No! lt just won't work.
lt's not the timers! This is not enough!
what's not enough?
the last bomb is not enough.
to complete the wave form.
Yeah. No. The last bomb has to be 30% larger.
that's six or seven pounds of plutonium.
where are we going to get six or seven pounds of plutonium?
guys, we got hit by an energy flare.
l can't keep us on course.
ejecting compartment in 50 seconds.
no, Beck! No, wait! No! Push it!
you push it!
come on, guys, l can't hear you.
lt's got my shoulder!
push!
guys!
clear!
clear the compartment! What are you doing?
l think the flare has knocked the Coms out.
l can't get it, Josh. l can't get it.
go...
l can't.
okay.
l'm sorry. l'm sorry.
can you hear me?
l'm correcting course. Now!
No!
push it!
ejecting compartment in ten seconds.
can you hear me?
Josh, go! Go! Go!
get out! Get out!
now! Get out! Now! Get out! Go!
for the last bomb, to make it larger...
use the fuel rods from the react...
ejecting.
l got to get...
l got to...
Beck, can you hear me?
Beck, if you have any better ideas, you tell me now.
we've only got three minutes to eject this one.
come on, guys. l can't hear you.
Josh, come on.
are you okay?
are you okay?
will you take my gloves off?
Oh, my God.
please.
l had to build the blast.
l'm sorry.
hold on, let me get...
no. Stay here for one second.
l was trying to call you.
l know the Coms were down.
right.
l know what you did.
we don't have enough energy...
l know.
...to get back.
you did good.
l would've done the same thing.
Where's Zimsky?
come here.
you did good.
you did good.
one minute to the first detonation.
and 12 until the blast hits us.
l was hoping we'd suffocate to death first.
what could you do if l got you enough power to fire the impeller?
maybe not the laser but the impeller.
what? From where?
the heat of the core.
lt's 9, 000 degrees.
Unobtainium converts heat to energy.
so this whole damn ship is like a big, old solar panel.
come on, l need your help.
number two's going!
for here in the great infinite unknowable...
man can come to know the most important thing of all;
himself.
he can understand...
what the fuck am l doing?
we've got full rotation!
lt's turning!
all right!
come on, Beck, where is it?
come on. Come on, hurry up.
ls that the last one?
Yeah.
give it a couple seconds.
lt worked!
get ready to pull a few G's.
420 knots.
now, this is more like it.
440
so, Rat, what's the center of this quake?
lt's everywhere!
lt's one giant shock wave!
the planet's healing itself.
at this speed, we're going to be home in a third of the time.
as long as we can surf these magma flows, we'll be okay.
let's just pray we don't run into any dead ends, or we're going to miss those lasers.
okay, navigator, which way?
we've got greater fluid density on the left.
go with the flow.
bill, where are they headed?
looks like she found a space between some tectonic plates somewhere near Hawaii.
they're closing in on us too fast.
l don't know if l can...
Hey, you got it.
um... w-we lost them, Stick, and l...
Where'd our power go?
well, we're powered by the heat.
lt's stone cold down here.
well...
look on the bright side.
at least we're not going to boil to death.
you always look on the bright side?
always.
okay, let's assess;
we've got no communications, we're probably 800 feet down, but we might as well be 800 miles.
we're in an Unobtainium cigar tube with the sonar signature of a rock.
we've got just enough power to make the ultrasonics burp, but no one's listening on those frequencies anyway, and...
nobody even knows we're alive.
okay.
give me a minute on this one.
this is hopeless.
come on, General, we've got to be getting close.
we can't...
Mr. Rat, even if they were still alive, there's no way they could contact us.
bridge.
skipper, Combat relays that our sub has something on the sonar.
where do they think?
bill, put it up on the hydrophone.
whales, sir.
they're a long way off their usual path, but that's not uncommon since that, uh...
what are they calling it?
orbital wobble?
Yeah, that's what they call it.
well, thank you very much, Captain, but l think we're done here.
general.
J. O. this is the captain.
stand down from SAR Operations.
lt's whales! lt's whales!
Hey! General!
lt's whales!
the ultrasonics!
they're singing to them!
you gotta find the whales!
l'm changing...
hold on, l'm seeing those whales now.
Whoa!
okay, ball's in the water.
this is neat. Those whales are circling something.
hold on, hold on.
we have a strong echo here.
depth, 800 feet.
there-there's something down there.
there's definitely something down there.
l told you pulsing the ultrasonics would work.
do you ever get tired of being right?
Yes.
so what's next for you?
a shower.
then back to NASA, l guess.
you?
deep-dish pepperoni pizza, green peppers, onions, extra mushrooms-- then a shower and then back to the classroom.
nasa could use a few good men, you know.
Yeah.
unfortunately, so could my freshmen geophysics students.
you know what makes me really, really angry?
you know what makes me really, really angry?
no one's going to ever know what they did or why they died.
unless...
it all got out somehow.
that's unthinkable.
Yeah.
okay, here we go.
sweet.
lt is now emerging that the world owes its survival to the heroism of six remarkable individuals
shuttle Commander Robert lverson,...
french Scientist, Dr. Serge...
edward Brazzleton is a name so...
Dr. Conrad Zimsky will be best remembered...
on Capitol Hill today, everyone's asking the same question
what is Project Destiny?
destiny, meet world.
world, meet Destiny.
look at the separation in the borderline
but don't look at everything here inside
here inside
and be afraid, afraid to speak your mind lt took a moment before l lost myself in here
good morning. -Good morning.
here ye, here ye, 1 0 minutes to go till Van Dort's wedding rehearsal.
watch it!
it's a beautiful day -It's a rather nice day
a day for a glorious wedding
a rehearsal, my dear to be perfectly clear
a rehearsal for a glorious wedding
assuming nothing happens that we don 't really know
that nothing unexpected interferes with the show
and that's why everything every last little thing
every single, tiny, microscopic little thing must go -According to plan -Our son will be married -According to plan -Our family carried
elevated to the heights of society -To the costume balls -In the hallowed halls
rubbing elbows with the finest
having crumpets with Her Highness
we'll be there, we'll be seen having tea with the queen
we'll forget everything that we 've ever, ever been -Blimey! It's my dress is caught. -Begging your pardon, Ma' am.
come on, dear. -It's not me. It's my dress is caught.
where is Victor? We might be late.
fish merchants.
it's a terrible day -Now, don 't be that way
it's a terrible day for a wedding
it's a sad, sad state of affairs we're in
that has led to this ominous wedding
how could our family have come to this?
to marry off our daughter to the nouveau riche -They're so common -So coarse -Oh, it couldn 't be worse -Couldn 't be worse? I'm afraid I disagree
they could be land-rich, Bankrupt aristocracy
without a penny to their name
just like you and me
Oh, dear.
and that's why everything every last little thing
every single, tiny, microscopic little thing Must go -According to plan -Our daughter will wed -According to plan -Our family led
from the depths of deepest poverty -To the noble realm -Of our ancestry
and who would have guessed in a million years -That our daughter with a face -Of an otter in disgrace
would provide our ticket to a rightful place
Oh, Hildegarde.
what if Victor and l don't like each other?
as if that has anything to do with marriage.
do you suppose your father and l like each other?
surely you must a little?
of course not. -Of course not.
get those corsets laced properly.
I can hear you speak without gasping.
you've certainly hooked a winner this time, Victor.
now, all you have to do is reel her in. -I'm already reeling, Mother.
shouldn't Victoria Everglot be marrying a lord or something?
Oh, nonsense! We're every bit as good as the Everglots.
I always knew I deserved better than a fish merchant's life.
but I've never even spoken to her.
well, at least we have that in our favor.
Mayhew! Silence that blasted coughing.
marriage is a partnership, a little tit for tat.
you'd think a lifetime watching us...
might have taught her that -Might have taught her that -Everything must be perfect -Everything must be perfect -Everything must be perfect
perfect that's why everything
every last little thing
every single, tiny, microscopic little thing must go
according to plan
look at the way you're standing.
you look like you got rickets or something...
Oh, my goodness. Oh, such grandeur! Such impeccable taste!
Oh, beautiful, innit?
it's not as big as our place, dear.
bit shabby really, isn't it? -Shut up.
lord and Lady Everglot...
...Mr. and Mrs. Van Dort.
why, you must be Miss Victoria.
Yes, I must say, you don't look a day over 20. No. Oh, yes.
smile, darling, smile.
well, hello. What a pleasure. Welcome to our home.
thank you.
we'll be taking tea in the west drawing room.
Oh, do come this way, it's just through there.
Oh, I love what you've done with the place. Who is your decorator?
nice tiles, shame about the drapes.
my husband says such foolish things. Ignore him.
Yes, it's usually best.
do forgive me. -You play beautifully.
I-- l-- I do apologize, Miss Everglot. How rude of me to-- Well...
excuse me.
mother won't let me near the piano.
music is improper for a young lady.
too passionate, she says.
if I may ask, Miss Everglot...
...where is your chaperon?
perhaps, in-- In view of the circumstances...
...you could call me Victoria.
Yes, of course. Well...
Victoria... -Yes, Victor.
tomorrow, we are to be m
m-- M
married. -Yes. Married.
since I was a child, I've-- I've dreamt of my wedding day.
I always hoped to find someone I was deeply in love with.
someone to spend the rest of my life with.
silly, isn't it? -Yes, silly.
no. No, not at all, no.
Oh, dear. I'm sorry.
what impropriety is this?
you shouldn't be alone together.
here it is, one minute before 5, and you're not at the rehearsal.
pastor Galswells is waiting. Come at once.
master Van Dort, from the beginning. Again.
with this hand, I will lift your sorrows.
your cup will never empty, for I will be your wine.
with this candle, I will light your way in darkness.
with this ring, I ask you to be mine.
let's try it again. -Yes. Yes, sir.
with this candle...
this candle...
this candle.
shall I get up there and do it for him? -Don't get all aflutter, dear.
with this candle...
continue!
get the door, Emil.
let's just pick it up at the candle bit.
a Lord Barkis, sir.
I haven't a head for dates.
apparently, I'm a day early for the ceremony.
ls he from your side of the family? -I can't recall.
Emil, a seat for Lord Barkis.
do carry on.
let's try it again, shall we, Master Van Dort?
Yes. Yes, sir. Certainly. -Right.
right. Oh, right!
with this... This-- -Hand.
with this hand...
...I-- With
three steps, three!
can you not count? Do you not wish to be married, Master Van Dort?
No! No. -You do not?
No! I meant, no, I do not not wish to be married.
that is, I want very much to
pay attention! Have you even remembered to bring the ring?
the ring? Yes. Of course.
dropping the ring. -Oh, no, he's dropped the ring!
this boy doesn't want to get married. -How disgraceful!
excuse me. Got it!
out of the way, you ninny.
Oh, dear! Oh, my! Giddy on, there's a woman on fire! Help! Emergency!
Oh, I hope it doesn't stain. -Stop fanning it, you fool.
get a bucket, get a bucket. -I'm on my way, dear. Yes. Oh, dear!
enough! This wedding cannot take place until he is properly prepared.
young man, learn your vows.
well, he's quite the catch, isn't he?
Oh, Victoria.
she must think I'm such a fool. This day couldn't get any worse.
hear ye, hear ye! Rehearsal in ruins as Van Dort boy causes chaos!
fishy fiance could be canned!
Everglots all fired up as Van Dort disaster ruins rehearsal!
it really shouldn't be all that difficult.
it's just a few simple vows.
with this hand, I will take your wine.
no.
with this hand...
...I will cup your
Oh, goodness, no.
with this...
with this...
with this candle, I will...
I will...
I will set your mother on fire.
Oh, it's no use.
with this hand, I will lift your sorrows.
your cup will never empty, for I will be your wine.
Mrs. Everglot.
you look ravishing this evening.
what's that, Mr. Everglot? Call you " Dad"? If you insist, sir.
with this candle, I will light your way in darkness.
with this ring...
...I ask you to be mine.
I do.
you may kiss the bride.
a new arrival. -He must've fainted.
are you all right? -What--? What happened?
by Jove, man. Looks like we've got ourselves a breather.
does he have a dead brother? -He's still soft.
a toast, then.
to the newlyweds.
newlyweds?
in the woods, you said your vows so perfectly.
I did?
I did.
wake up! Wake up! Wake up!
coming through, coming through.
my name is Paul, I am the head waiter.
I will be creating your wedding feast.
wedding feast! I'm salivating.
maggots.
keep away!
I've got a-- I've got a dwarf.
and I'm not afraid to use him. I want some questions. Now!
answers. I think you mean "answers." -Thank you, yes, answers.
I need answers. What's going on here? Where am l?
who are you?
well, that's kind of a long story.
what a story it is.
a tragic tale of romance, passion...
...and murder most foul.
this is gonna be good.
hit it, boys.
Hey, give me a listen you corpses of cheer
at least those of you who still got an ear
I'll tell you a story Make a skeleton cry of our own jubiliciously lovely Corpse Bride
die, die, we all pass away
but don 't wear a frown because it's really okay
you might try and hide and you might try and pray
but we all end up the remains of the day
that's right.
well, our girl was a beauty known for miles around
when a mysterious stranger came into town
he was plenty good-looking but down on his cash
and our poor little baby she fell hard and fast
when her daddy said no she just couldn 't cope
so our lovers came up with a plan to elope
die, die, we all pass away
but don 't wear a frown because it's really okay
you might try and hide and you might try and pray
but we all end up the remains of the day
that's right.
okay. Oh, yeah. Come on, boys, pick it up.
Yeah. Like it.
okay, Chancy, take it.
Yeah.
Yeah!
that's nice.
so they conjured up a plan to meet late at night
they told not a soul kept the whole thing tight
now, her mother's wedding dress fit like a glove
you don 't need much When you're really in love
except for a few things or so I'm told
like the family jewels and a satchel of gold
then next to the graveyard by the old oak tree
on a dark foggy night at a quarter to 3
she was ready to go but where was he?
and then?
she waited -And then?
there in the shadows, was it her man? -And then?
her little heart beat so loud -And then?
and then, baby, everything went black
now, when she opened her eyes she was dead as dust
her jewels were missing and her heart was bust
so she made a vow lying under that tree
that she'd wait for her true love to come set her free
always waiting for someone to ask for her hand
then out of the blue comes this groovy young man
who vows forever to be by her side
and that's the story of our Corpse Bride
die, die, we all pass away
but don 't wear a frown, because it's really okay
you might try and hide And you might try and pray
but we all end up the remains of the day
Yeah.
Victoria, come away from the window.
Oh, I'm sure he'll be back shortly.
he's terrified of the dark. In fact, when he was a boy...
...he used to wet his combinations regularly, didn't he, William?
enter.
lord Barkis. I trust the room is to your liking.
thank you, you are a most gracious hostess.
which is why it pains me to be the bearer of such bad news.
would you care to repeat tonight's headline for us?
hear ye, hear ye!
Victor Van Dort seen this night on the bridge in the arms of a mystery woman!
the dark-haired temptress and Master Van Dort slipped away into the night!
and now, the weather. Scattered showers
enough! That will be all.
mystery woman? He doesn't even know any women!
or so you thought.
do call for me if you need my assistance...
...in any way.
good heavens, Finis, what should we do?
fetch me musket.
William, do something.
the town crier probably just had a slow news day.
you know how it is, you need a little something to cry about.
regardless, we are one groom short for the wedding tomorrow.
not to mention the financial implications.
a most scandalous embarrassment for us all.
Oh, give us a chance to find him, we beg of you.
just give us until dawn. -Very well. Till dawn.
Victor, darling, where are you?
if you ask me, your boyfriend is kind of jumpy.
he's not my boyfriend, he's my husband.
Victor, where have you gone?
I'll keep an eye out for him.
Victor?
there he goes, there he goes! He's-- He's getting away!
quick, quick, after him!
Victor.
thank you.
Victor!
where are you?
Victor?
where have you gone?
married, huh? I'm a widow.
Oh, how rude. He went that way!
Victor.
Victor, darling.
please. There's been a mistake. I'm not dead.
excuse me. Excuse me.
excuse me. -Excuse me.
thank you. -Thank you.
Victor.
dead end. -Victor!
Hello!
could have used the stairs, silly.
isn't the view beautiful? It takes my breath away.
well, it would if I had any.
isn't it romantic?
look, I am terribly sorry about what's happened to you...
...and I'd like to help, but I really need to get home.
this is your home now. -But I don't even know your name.
well, that's a great way to start a marriage.
shut up!
it's Emily. -Emily.
Oh, I almost forgot. I have something for you.
it's a wedding present.
thank you.
scraps?
Scraps!
my dog, Scraps!
Oh, Scraps, what a good boy.
I knew you'd be happy to see him.
who's my good boy? Sit. Sit, Scraps, sit.
good boy, Scraps. Roll over. Roll over.
good boy, Scraps. Play dead.
sorry.
Oh, what a cutie.
you should have seen him with fur.
mother never approved of Scraps jumping up like this.
but then again, she never approved of anything.
do you think she would have approved of me?
you're lucky you'll never have to meet her.
well, actually...
...now that you mention it, I think you should.
in fact, since we're, you know...
...Married, you should definitely meet her.
and my father too. We should go and see them right now.
what a fantastic idea! Where are they buried?
what? What is it? -They're not from around here.
where are they?
Oh, they're still alive.
I'm afraid so. -Well, that is a problem.
what's that, Scraps?
Oh, no, we couldn't possibly.
Oh, well, if you put it like that. -What?
elder Gutknecht.
scraps.
elder Gutknecht...
...are you there?
Hello? Is anyone home?
Hello?
there you are!
Oh, my dear. There you are.
I've brought my husband, Victor.
what's that? Husband?
pleasure to meet you, sir.
we need to go up. Upstairs? To visit the land of the living.
land of the living?
Oh, my dear.
please, Elder Gutknecht.
now, why go up there, when people are dying to get down here?
sir, I beg you to help. It means so much to me
us. -I don't know, it's just not natural.
please, Elder Gutknecht.
surely there must be something you can do.
let me see what I can do.
where did I put that book?
I left it here somewhere.
there's the one.
I have it.
a Ukrainian haunting spell. Just the thing for these quick trips.
so glad you thought of this. -Me too.
now, then...
...where were we?
the Ukrainian haunting spell?
here we have it. Ready?
just remember, when you want to come back, say "Hopscotch."
hopscotch? -That's it.
I spent so long in the darkness...
...I'd almost forgotten how beautiful the moonlight is.
Hey, I think you dropped something.
hold on, hold on.
I think I should prepare Mother and Father for the big news.
I'll go ahead and you...
...Wait here.
perfect. -I won't be long.
stay right here. I'll be right back.
okay.
no peeking.
if ever I see that Van Dort boy...
...I'll strangle him with my bare hands.
your hands are too fat, and his neck is too thin.
you'll have to use a rope.
this is the voice of your conscience. Listen to what I say.
I have a bad feeling about that boy. You know he is no
go chew someone else's ear for a while.
Victor has gone to see his parents, just like he said.
if I hadn't just been sitting in it, I would say that you had lost your mind!
I'm sure he has a perfectly good reason for taking so long.
I am sure he does. Why don't you go ask him?
all right, I will.
after all, he couldn't get far with those cold feet.
Victoria. -Victor? I'm so happy to see you.
come by the fire. Where have you been? Are you all right?
I-- l
Oh, dear.
you're as cold as death. What's happened to you?
your coat.
Victoria, I confess.
this morning I was terrified of marriage.
but then, on meeting you, I felt I should be with you always...
...and that our wedding could not come soon enough.
Victor, I feel the same.
Victoria, I se-- I se
I seem to find myself married.
and you should know it's unexpected.
my darling, I just wanted to meet
darling? Who's this?
who is she? -I'm his wife.
Victor? -Victoria, wait. You don't understand.
she's dead. Look.
hopscotch.
No! No! Victoria!
you lied to me!
just to get back to that other woman.
don't you understand? You're the other woman.
No! You're married to me. She's the other woman.
she's got a point.
and I thought... I thought this was all going so well.
look, I'm sorry, but...
...this just can't work.
why not?
it's my eye, isn't it?
no. Your eye is Iovely.
listen, under different circumstances, well, who knows?
but we're just too different. I mean, you're dead.
you should've thought about that before you asked me to marry you.
why can't you understand? It was a mistake. I would never marry you.
roses for eternal love.
lilies for sweetness.
baby's breath.
why so blue?
maybe he's right. Maybe we are too different.
maybe he should have his head examined.
I could do it.
or perhaps he does belong with her. Little Miss Living.
with her rosy cheeks and beating heart.
Oh, those girls are ten a penny. You've got so much more.
you've got-- You've got
you've got a wonderful personality.
what does that wispy little brat have that you don 't have double?
she can 't hold a candle to the beauty of your smile
how about a pulse?
overrated by a mile -Overvalued -Overblown
if he only knew the you that we know
and that silly little creature isn 't wearing his ring
and she doesn 't play piano or dance, or sing
no, she doesn 't compare -But she still breathes air -Who cares?
unimportant -Overrated -Overblown -If only he could see
how special you can be
if he only knew the you that we know
if I touch a burning candle I can feel no pain
if you cut me with a knife It's still the same
and I know her heart is beating
and I know that I am dead
yet the pain here that I feel
try and tell me it's not real
and it seems that I still have a tear to shed
the sole redeeming feature from that little creature
is that she's alive -Overrated -Overblown
everybody knows that's just a temporary state
which is cured very quickly When we meet our fate -Who cares? -Unimportant -Overrated -Overblown
if only he could see how special you can be
if he only knew The you that we know
if I touch a burning candle I can feel no pain
in the ice or in the sun It's all the same
yet I feel my heart is aching
though it doesn 't beat, it's breaking
and the pain here that I feel
try and tell me it's not real
I know that I am dead
yet it seems that I still have some tears to shed
it's true, Mother!
Victor is married to a dead woman.
I saw her. A corpse! Standing right here with Victor.
Victor was in your room?
I have to help him.
the scandal!
come sit in your chair, dearie. You're shaking like a leaf.
let Hilde fetch you a blanket.
fetch her a straitjacket! She's completely mad!
come, Hildegarde.
finis, come to bed at once.
what in heaven's name?
who could that be at this hour?
miss Everglot.
what are you doing here? You should be at home, prostrate with grief.
pastor Galswells, I have to ask you something.
this is most irregular. -Please, I beg of you.
you are the only one in the village who knows of what awaits beyond the grave.
a grim topic for a bride-to-be.
it is a bride I fear, which is why I must know:
can the living marry the dead?
what on earth are you speaking about?
please, it's Victor. He's married to a corpse.
he has a corpse bride!
there must be some way to undo what's been done.
I believe I know the thing to do.
come with me.
Victoria? Where are your corsets?
she's speaking in tongues. Of unholy alliances.
her mind has come undone, I fear.
it's not true! Let me go! Let me go!
thank you, Pastor Galswells. Thank you so very much.
take her to her room!
no, I'm telling the truth.
Victor needs my help.
Hildegarde, you believe me, don't you?
mother, Father, please. -Seal the doors...
...and bar the windows. See to it that she doesn't escape again.
he needs our help! Oh, let me go! Let me go!
will the mortification never cease?
it will be years before we can show ourselves in public again.
what shall we do?
we shall continue as planned, with or without Vincent.
Victor. -Whatever.
for that boy to toss aside a young woman like Victoria...
...It's positively criminal.
why, if I had a woman like your daughter on my arm...
...I would lavish her with riches befitting royalty.
your lady wife is a most fortunate woman.
alas, I am not married.
I was betrothed some years ago...
...but tragedy snatched my young bride away.
when one lives alone, wealth counts for naught.
marvelous news, Victoria, there'll be a wedding after all.
you found him?
make haste, my dear, our relatives will arrive at any moment.
we must have you looking presentable for Lord Barkis.
lord Barkis?
he will make a fine husband.
Aye. A fortuitous turn of events indeed.
a far better prospect this time.
but I do not love him. You cannot make me do this.
we must. -Please, I beg of you.
there must be another way.
without your marriage to Lord Barkis...
...we shall be forced, penniless, into the street.
we are destitute.
but Victor...
Victor Van Dort has gone, child.
you shall marry Lord Barkis tomorrow.
according to plan. -According to plan.
Oh, my dear. Oh, don't look at me that way.
you have only to suffer this union until death do us part.
and that will come sooner than you think.
Oh, it's almost dawn! Where could he be?
Victor Van Dort elopes with corpse!
heartbroken bride to wed wealthy newcomer!
wealthy newcomer? It cannot be.
did he say corpse?
Oh, don't be ridiculous. What corpse would marry our Victor?
Oh, Mayhew! Silence that blasted coughing.
mayhew, are you trying to kill us?
I think he's trying to kill us.
I...
...Think you dropped this.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I lied to you about wanting to see my parents.
it's just this whole day hasn't gone quite, well...
...According to plan.
pardon my enthusiasm.
I like your enthusiasm.
new arrival! New arrival! -Lights up!
hurry up, boys!
drinks for everyone.
another pint, sir?
no, no. Just a half. -No, no. Just a half.
it is impossible to get good help anymore.
welcoming committee, coming through! Coming through!
my name's Plum. Miss Plum. -Mayhew?
Mayhew! How nice to see
I'm so sorry.
Oh, yeah. Actually, though, I feel great.
hurry up, boys. Can you not see the gentleman is parched?
mayhew, I have to get back.
they all must be worried sick. How is everyone?
well, they're still wondering where you slipped off to.
Oh, and Miss Victoria...
yes? Yes, how is she?
well, she's getting married this evening.
what? Married to who?
some newcomer, Lord Somebody-or-Other.
but that's impossible!
Yeah, with you gone and all...
I guess they didn't wanna waste the cake.
but how could she?
women, you can't live with them.
you can't live with
time to pick up the pieces and-- You know, and move on, I suppose.
speaking of picking up the pieces?
Victor? Where are you going?
miss Victoria, we must leave for the church now.
yesterday I thought my wedding would be happy.
now I feel like I'm caught in the tide, pulled out to sea.
the sea leads to many places, dearie.
maybe you'll land somewhere better.
with this candle, I will light your way in darkness.
with this ring, I ask you to be mine.
I now pronounce you man and wife.
Oh, oh, dear.
I'm too late.
Oh, Mrs. Plum, what am I to do?
he just walked off without saying a word. Are all men like this?
well, I'm afraid none of them are very bright.
they get something stuck in their heads...
...and you can't do a thing with them.
my dear, we have to talk.
let me tell her, please. Let me tell her. -What?
there is a complication with your marriage.
I don't understand.
the vows are binding only until death do you part.
what are you saying?
death has already parted you.
if he finds out, he'll leave.
there must be something you can do.
well, there is one way.
Oh, please, please, let me tell her.
it requires the greatest sacrifice.
go on, get to the good part. -What is it?
we have to kill him! -What?
Victor would have to give up the life he had forever.
he would need to repeat his vows in the land of the living...
...and drink from the wine of ages.
poison!
this would stop his heart forever.
only then would he be free to give it to you.
I could never ask him.
you don't have to.
I'll do it.
my boy, if you choose this path...
...you may never return to the world above.
do you understand?
I do.
gather round. Gather round, everybody.
we've decided to do this thing properly.
so grab what you can and follow us.
we're moving this wedding party upstairs.
upstairs? I didn't know we had an upstairs.
sounds creepy. -Let's go!
a wedding, a wedding We're going to have a wedding
hold on, Victor.

Oh, dear.
quiet down now, everyone.
thank you.
elegant, cultured, radiant.
victoria has found a husband...
...with all these qualities and more.
serendipity brought us together...
...and no force on earth could tear us apart.
there's an eye in me soup.
Oh, sorry.
fetch me musket!
fetch your own musket. I'm off!
coming through. Coming through.
excuse me, you don't know me, but I used to live in your dead mother.
Hey, hold on there.
I love a woman with meat on her bones.
finis, who invited these people?
they must be from your side of the family.
certainly not.
why, if my Grandfather Everglot could see this, he'd be turning in his grave.
finis.
where do you keep the spirits?
in other news, the dead walk the earth!
get back! Don't try and sneak up on me!
get back!
I'll give you such a wallop.
no.
Yeah.
grandpa?
bounder! -Sweetie pie.
monster. -Buttercup.
CAD! -Gertrude!
Alfred?
you've been dead for 1 5 years.
frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.
Ethel!
wait. That's it.
we're going to take whatever money we can and get out of here.
money? What money?
your dowry. It's my right!
but my parents don't have any money.
it's my marriage to you that will save them from the poorhouse.
th-- The poorhouse?
you're lying. It isn't true. Tell me that you're lying!
did things not go according to your plan, Lord Barkis?
well, perhaps in disappointment we are perfectly matched.
be gone, ye demons from hell!
back to the void from whence you came!
you shall not enter here.
back, back!
keep it down, we're in a church.
evening.
dearly beloved and departed...
...we are gathered here today to join this man and this corpse in marriage.
Victor?
living first.
with this hand...
...I will lift your sorrows.
your cup will never empty...
...for I will be your wine.
now you.
with this hand...
...I will lift your sorrows.
your cup will never empty.
for I will be...
I will be...
go on, my dear.
your cup will never empty
...for I will be...
I will be your wine.
she's having second thoughts.
I can't.
what's wrong?
this is wrong.
I was a bride.
my dreams were taken from me.
well, now...
now I've stolen them from someone else.
I love you, Victor.
but you're not mine.
Victoria!
Oh, how touching.
I always cry at weddings.
our young lovers together at last.
surely now they can live happily ever after.
but you forget she's still my wife!
I'll not leave here empty-handed!
you?
Emily?
you!
but-- But-- I left you.
for dead.
this woman is obviously delusional!
sorry to cut things short, but we must be on our way.
take your hands off her.
do I have to kill you too?
Victor, catch!
sorry.
I say, you're not playing fair, sir.
Touche, my dear.
get out.
Oh, I'm leaving.
but first a toast. To Emily.
always the bridesmaid, never the bride.
tell me, my dear...
...can a heart still break once it's stopped beating?
let me at him! Let me at him!
no, don't hold me back. -Wait.
we must abide by their rules.
we are amongst the living.
well said.
not anymore.
Yep, you're right. He's all yours.
new arrival.
Oh, Victor, I never thought I'd see you again.
wait.
I made a promise.
you kept your promise.
you set me free.
Helena's here. How do I look?
Oh, you look great.
you're five pounds of heaven in a six-inch heel.
I just got these shoes. Do you think she'll like them?
why am I asking you?
you don't know what's chic.
she does. Look at you.
you got a girl crush on Helena. That's adorable.
I do not have a crush on Helena. It's business.
you know, she's here to show us her new e-date site for seniors.
I'm just glad my dad is taking lead on this account because elderly romance falls slightly outside my comfort zone.
wait... your dad's handling the e-date thing?
he's supposed to be running the voice-over session for Musk.
but I need him. Helena's waiting.
well, I need him more.
what the...?!
what do you got?
see, uh, stacked.\
nice can. Stacked. - Yeah.
nice can. Something about boobs and butts.
who could think in this heat?
Yeah, when are they gonna fix your air conditioner?
I don't know whether to check my ass or scratch my watch.
Lord, yes!
dad, I need your help with...
God, it is hot in here.
I need you for the e-date meeting.
but you promised to run the voice-over session.
Oh, sweet Lord, two attractive suitors.
I am positively swooning.
Ooh, my menagerie!
dad, e-date meeting now!
voice-over session. You promised.
I did promise Andrew.
fine. I'll just go tell Helena that you made other plans.
whoa. Helena's here?
Andrew, you'll have to do the session by yourself.
you've done it a thousand times with me.
Yeah, but I've never been in charge.
I'm just the guy who nods at you and sometimes shrugs.
it's your moment to shine. Are you ready?
Really?
good enough for me. Helena awaits.
now, Zachary, does this shirt make my eyes pop?
Oh, bluer than a Yankee boy's uniform.
dear God, you could charm the stripes off a baby zebra.
come on, now! Come sashay with me. Be my pleasure.
please help me. I'm starting to get the vapors.
Oh, I got you. Support me through this moment.
don't worry, now.
here we are, like bees to honey.
like moth to a flame.
you know, we did a hell of a job on your other dating sites. We'll do it again on this one.
as you know, we're a soup-to-nuts agency.
Yeah, I provide the nuts. And I really enjoy soup.
Oh, we love it when you do!
Really? How about "Gray Down There"?
it's Just Dinner at Lunchtime.
prostate Players.
you are both so naughty.
I love being naughty! Yeah, spank me, spank me!
but don't worry, we'll nail the name.
how does this site work?
well, our customer creates a profile...
Ooh, make one for Simon!
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes!
Simon Roberts. Male.
original hair, mostly original parts.
Six-foot-two. Actually, I'm five-eight.
everyone lies. Six-two is Internet for five-eight.
you save five-eight, you're Peter Dinklage.
so which parts aren't original?
wouldn't you like to know?
it's my knee.
so who's this voice-over guy?
Fred Melamed. He's a legend.
you might not know his name, but you know his voice.
cbs News, CBS Sports, Boar's Head meats and cheeses.
he's the Boar's Head guy?
he made me quit being vegan.
Mr. Melamed, it is such an honor.
my name is Andrew, and I'll be handling...
I don't really need to know your name, hippie.
hippie? That's, uh...
by the way, listen, that's Corinthian leather.
Oh, I don't dabble in the doobie.
Oh, I'm sure you don't.
just follow me.
first question, on scale of one to ten, - how sexually adventurous are you?\ - Ten.
with ten including bondage and light-to-medium spanking.
four. Maybe a lazy five.
hell, when the moon's full, six.
with you, seven. Let's just round it off to a racy 8. 5 and be done with it.
ten. We'll get to your profile later.
second question.
what weather system best describes your sex life?
if we're talking last summer, I'd say hurricane.
ironically, with a woman named Katrina.
at the moment, bit of a drought.
fields are dry, crops are withering.
it Is He Who Sits With His Fist is my tribal name.
a handsome man like you should never have a dry spell.
it's a crime.
felony or misdemeanor? I don't mind being cuffed.
Hey, sorry I'm late.
so, who's getting cuffed?
no, nothing. Your dad in some weird sex act.
no, no, can we not talk about this in front of...?
heavens, why not? She's an adult.
Sydney's not some prudish American, are you?
I love hearing my dad talk about his sex life.
what could possibly be uncomfortable about that?
besides, our Web site's designed to help older people end their long dry spells.
hasn't been that long. It's only been a month or so.
a month?
can you imagine?
I mean, what even happens to the human body?
well, I could sit here and talk about sex all day with my dad, um, but we have another meeting.
sydney, I'm only in town a week. You will make time for me, yes?
Yes! It's a date. I mean, not a date-date.
it's a lady-female date. It's more fun than a date.
we'll have fun, like always.
uh, next question. Okay.
do you accept checks?
sorry, muffin.
we've all been there. So cool with this!
I'm glad she's cool with it.
okay!
and whenever you are ready...
sir.
all right, laying it down in three, two...
men today are afraid of women.
well, I'm not scared to be sexy.
I unbutton the second button on my shirt.
you know the one.
and then I slap on some Musk, because women smell fear.
well, I think that was golden. Now on to the tag.
he's so commanding. Very alpha.
don't you think he could be a touch less serial killer-y?
I gotta tell him. I wouldn't do that.
Hey, uh, that was great, Fred.
I can't hear a word you're saying.
spit out the bong water and hold down that damn button!
sorry. Uh, that was great, but, uh, could we try one more, just a little more up?
up?
uh, yeah, you know, just happier, brighter, chirpy.
you want me to be chirpy?
don't say yes. - Yes! Here's a little trick that I learned:
smile when you talk.
because when you do that, people can actually hear the smile.
go ahead, uh, try it.
Yeah, you know, that is very good.
that is a really valuable suggestion.
I'm so surprised I've never heard that once before in my over three decades riding this mic for the likes of Sony Consumer Products, the Nagano Olympics, MCI, Mercedes-Benz, the NFL on CBS, all before you huffed your first can of paint thinner, Spicoli!
we shouldn't feel uncomfortable speaking about adult stuff in front of each other.
you know, when we're at work, we're not fatherdaughter; we're colleagues.
it's true. I've discussed my sexual peccadilloes with many a coll.
see? There you go. I mean, you know, the daughter in me says,"Ew, gross, that's disgusting.
but, you know, the colleague in me says, "You go get yourself some lady business, Simon.
Oh, how I wish the colleague in you hadn't just said that.
me, too. It really creeped me out. I'm sorry.
but we're not finished!
no, but you're finished. - What's wrong?
the boy can't pry his lips off the bong long enough to get the job done.
sayonara.
don't leave!
no, I think Sean Connery was definitely the best 007 I ever had sex with.
when I grow up, I want to be you.
modeling in Paris, building schools in Kenya.
it was against store policy, but I was not going to be denied.
see? You're a rebel.
I am kind of.
What'd you do last night?
I bet it was something fabulous.
last night? Let's see.
Ah, made love with Zachary.
Zachary? My... my-my Zachary?
But-but, what, Zachary?
he's delightful.
he's like a naughty pool boy.
I've taken him as a lover.
Wow. You take lovers like I take extra mints at the Sizzler.
no, Zachary is quite different from the others.
he has the most charming sex face.
I'm-I'm sorry. The what? - Sex face.
you know, orgasm face. It's...
Oh, my God, he does not do that! Do it again! Do it again!
it's more dreamy.
Oh, my God! Yeah.
sadly, I must run.
Oh, this was so much fun!
we should plan to do it again.
I never plan. I'm more of a "drop by" girl.
so drop by sometime.
au revoir.
the design looks great.
they look so happy.
maybe a little less denture.
Hey. How'd it go with Helena last night?
you guys talk about me?
arrogant much? No, we didn't, actually.
this might surprise you, but Zach Cropper is not the center of the universe.
the late Nana Gert would disagree.
don't do that!
do what?
the face! Don't make that face!
you know it's my "O" face, don't you?
Oh, don't call it that.
at least Helena called it your "sex face
which is way less revolting.
so you did talk about me.
ne, yes. We did.
we talked about you.
we're friends.
Helena has taken me as a friend, and friends talk about things.
like your "O" face.
it's pretty great, isn't it?
but it didn't start out that way.
my earlier one was, mmm, something less than a triumph.
Oh, confirmed. It was not a triumph.
it was, like...
Oh, that's it. It's come a long way.
say, does anyone have a cyanide capsule I could borrow?
Oh, I might.
so, when are you seeing Helena again?
soon. When are you seeing Helena again?
sooner. I'm on "drop by" stat."
so am I.
Hi, girlfriend. I was not expecting you.
well, you know, you said to just drop by, so I thought I would just drop by and...
Oh, Zach's here.
God, I'm so sorry.
did he... did he make the face?
not quite. This one's a grunter, not a smiler.
a grunter? Someone new?
darling, shall we get breakfast or...?
or a very uncomfortable brunch for three?
Hi, piglet.
these images hope to capture the romance and tenderness of couples finding love in their golden years.
Oh... Gross!
kids are gonna see this!
are we watching The Walking Dead?!
okay, is this about me screwing up the voice-over session?
it's not about you, Andrew.
by the way, I talked to Fred.
he's willing to give you another shot.
I have jury duty that day and diarrhea.
that's the spirit.
this is about us.
look, I understand it might be awkward for you if I date Helena, - so I'll never see her again if that's what you want. - Good. That's what I want.
Oh, come on! Really?
listen, you told me I should be out there pursuing people.
she's a person.
never mind. Forget it.
I'll end it with us.
you really like her, don't you?
Yeah, I do. I really do.
even more, I like me when I'm with her.
you're right.
I'm... I'm happy for you, honestly.
cross your heart, hope to die, stick a finger in your eye?
been watching a lot of the Stooges again.
you know there's something truly wrong with you, right?
Yeah, big time.
okay.
then it's settled.
away from work, Helena is your girlfriend and my friend...
...but at work...
colleagues. Just business.
Yeah, we're partners who don't let our personal lives intrude.
I'm just glad you're okay with this.
Helena makes me feel young.
Oh, God. Zach.
see, this is why the lover thing is so confusing.
right? I mean, how many are you allowed to take?
what are the rules?
it's not about the number, Zach.
it's that one of them is my father.
your boss.
a fact that has not escaped me.
everyone know a pride can't have two lion kings.
do you think I should let him be sexually dominant?
I think this is a conversation I never wanted to have about my father.
and thank you, by the way, for ruining the memory of my favorite childhood movie.
Oh, hakuna matata.
look, I just don't want this little comedy of errors to hurt us at work, okay?
or worse, hurt my father.
I do not want to see him get hurt.
Yeah, he does have that new knee.
emotionally, you jerk.
don't worry.
I'll take care of it. Thank you.
although it's not going to be easy.
I'll never forget the things Helena showed me.
big Ben...
tower of London...
Beefeaters.
please tell me you went to England.
no, they're sex acts.
Hey, boss.\
nice sandwich.
thank you.
you know, making a great sandwich is a lot like making love.
it takes care, patience and a delicate blend of ingredients.
more than one pickle, the whole thing's ruined.
Funnu should say that.
um, I-I wanted to talk to you about Helena.
Oh, Helena.
as lovely as a poem.
I took the one less traveled by.
Yeah.
turns out it's actually been traveled before.
quite recently, in fact. Really?
we have something in common, you and I.
besides great hair?
uh, Fred's here, and he looks angry, so...
Helena has taken us both as lovers.
so I was thinking, I will deal with that.
I see.
Yeah. So you and Helena are... - Yeah.
was it...? - Transcendent? Oh, yeah.
Mmm. Oh, I'm sorry. What were you gonna say?
well, not "transcendent"!
holy hell, how can I compete with that?
I was feeling like a stud when my knee didn't give out.
Transcendent?!
I've got pretty good game, but give a guy a break.
look, the good news is that there is an adorable term for men in our position.
Yeah. Bloody rivals.
Eskimo brothers.
ha ha ha! I'm not ready to be adorable with you just yet.
look, S-Simon, I-I get that this comes as a bit of a shock, so I just want you to know that as my boss and as my friend,
I promise not to steal her away from you.
well, just out of curiosity, what makes you think you could?
Hey, you guys, Helena's here for...
so this is happening now.
my transcendent friend Zach here thinks he can steal my little mermaid from me.
Oh! Great. There goes my second favorite childhood movie.
just forget it.
I'm gonna finish my sandwich, and I'm not sharing!
boss, boss, let me just...No, I got it. I-I can help you with that.
geez.
Oh, God, don't make that face!
I got it, I got it.
Oh! Oh, God. No grunting, Dad. I...
Oh, God, please!
for God's sake, I'm your daughter!
no, no grunting! I got it, I got it, I got it...
let her be!
this is exactly what I was afraid would happen.
look, we need to settle this.
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
I don't know why everyone is so upset.
I enjoy you both, but we're just lovers. Uh-huh.
I love having sex with you... Thank you.
...I love having sex with you... Bless you.
...and I love talking about it with you. What's the problem?
I think you just summed it up pretty well.
really this just crosses way too many boundaries.
like a clown car of complications.
not to mention it violates all the rules of client service.
I thought that I serviced the client pretty well.
so did I, right? You both did a lovely job. SYDNEY: Oh, God.
look, Helena.
I love our friendship... I really do...
but because of it,
I know way too many gross things about them.
you know too much about us?
uh, what about Cheryl and your "college lesbian" phase?
Simon: How about the year you grew pot in Mendocino?
that month that you spent stripping at that little place in Reno.
I told you those things in confidence.
and at least two of them aren't even true.
you lied to me?
I-I thought everyone knew.
I just wanted to seem... European, you know?
I wanted you to like me. - I do like you.
but you like me, too, right? - Of course.
more than me? - I already told you that I'm not gonna steal her...
will you stop saying that!
guys, enough!
okay, this cannot continue.
no, clearly not.
you're making this all so awkward.
Helena, wait.
did she show you the Beefeater?
Oh, I love it so much.
you can do this.
is he a monster? Yes.
are you a professional monster slayer?
no, because that's not a thing.
but I believe in you.
we got everything from last time.
it was terrific.
all we need right now is the tag, "Musk, do not be afraid
and then we're good.
any way you want to do it.
fine.
laying it down in three, two...
donut be afraid.
all right, that's a wrap on Fred.
did he just say, "Donut be afraid?
Yeah.
Yeah, uh, that was terrific.
we just need one more for safety.
again, it's, "Musk, do not be afraid.
any way you want to do it.
all right, fine.
do not be afraid - Fine.
take number two.
in three, two...
Muskdonot...
be afraid.
all right, then, tail lights on Fred.
well? Do something.
fred: No, that was my last take.
there's a black and tan with my name on it.
good night, rookie.
Oh, no. He's leaving.
put those headphones back on.
what was that? - You heard me.
no, I didn't. You forgot to push down the damn button again, you moron.
I said, put those headphones back on.
we're not done until say we're done.
well, look at you.
tough guy with three inches of soundproof glass between us.
to my face.
tell my sisters that I love them.
okay.
closer.
now...
say it.
well, so much has happened,
I forgot what it was that we were gonna...
no. Wait.
you put those headphones back on.
you're not done until I say you're done.
erase my browser history!
you're shaking.
like a young Chihuahua.
you followed your fear and it brought you here, right into my arms.
that's right.
you passed the test.
you earned my respect.
so all this was just a teachable moment?
I was grasping a boy, and now I release...
a man.
I have only one more thing left to say to you.
do not be afraid.
I'm not anymore.
then get the hell out of here...
Mandrew.
Mandrew...
I-I can't even begin to tell you how sorry I am that everything got so complicated.
how about from now on we just respect each other's boundaries and we will refocus on your account?
will I be crossing a boundary when I get in the lift?
it's not you. It is us, huh?
you know, in Europe, sex is a good thing, you know?
but this is America.
we like our sex shameful, the way God intended it to be.
that's why Mormons make love standing up...
so the Big Guy thinks they're dancing.
I now know things about my daughter I wish I didn't, whether they're true or not.
mostly not. It's okay.
but at the end of the day, even though she's my colleague, she'll always be my little girl first.
and I'm her dad.
I like that.
my sexually neutered dad.
no offense.
some taken. Not neutered.
and we really hope that you don't, but if you choose to take your accounts elsewhere, we will understand.
and miss all this delicious complication?
not a chance.
you three...
so delightful.
and so American.
the recording is completely finished.
and your toad-licking lad there grew a pair.
a magnificent pair. Indeed they are.
well, hello.
hello.
in a world where love is blind but only the blind can see, one beautiful woman and one powerful man will unite to change the fate of all mankind.
Really?
tell me more.
what just happened?
I've taken her for a lover.
is it me, or is she actually just a psycho?
I wonder if we'll ever see her again...
or if she's disappeared from our lives like a sexually omnivorous Mary Poppins.
ruined.
good job, Stretch.
but if honesty's the best policy, let's just call this a delightful surprise.
I think that's the nicest thing you almost ever said to me.
Syd, just to satisfy my own curiosity, out of the naughty things you told Helena you didn't do, which is the one that you did?
not answering.
stripping in Reno. - Can't hear you.
my money's on the pot.
going to my happy place.
college lesbian phase.
I was young.
Yes!
don't make the face. - Sorry.
Ah! Mr. Melamed, it is such an honor.
my name is Andrew, and I'll be...
you don't really need to.
Oh, sorry.
confirmed, it was not a triumph.
it was, like...
once more, from the top.
that's my train.
wait! wait!
this time tomorrow?
where will we be?
on a spaceship somewhere?
sailing across an empty sea?
this time tomorrow?
what will we know?
will we still be here?
watching an in-flight movie show?
I'll leave the sun behind me?
and I'll watch the clouds as they sadly pass me by?
seven miles below me?
I can see the world and it ain't so big at all?
this time tomorrow?
what will we see?
fields full of houses?
endless rows of crowded streets?
shit.
wake up, jack.
have you seen Francis?
Hello,Peter.
good afternoon. Whitman?
may I see your tickets, please?
Thanks.
there's no smoking, please.
welcome aboard.
sweet lime?
Yes, please. sure, I'll have one. sounds good.
let's go get a drink and smoke a cigarette.
I want to start by thanking you both for being here. thank you.
you're welcome. thank you.
you're the two most important people in the world to me.
I've never said that before, but it's true, and I want you both to know it.
I love you, Peter.
thank you.
I love you, Jack.
I love you, too.
how did it get to this?
why haven't we spoken in a year?
let's make an agreement.
to do what? okay.
I want us to become brothers again
like we used to be, and for us to find ourselves
and bond with each other.
can we agree to that?
okay. yeah. I want us
to make this trip a spiritual journey,
where each of us seek the unknown, and we learn about it.
can we agree to that?
sure. I guess so.
I want us to be completely open
and say yes to everything,
even if it's shocking and painful.
can we agree to that?
now, I had
Brendan make us an itinerary.
who's Brendan?
my new assistant.
he's gonna place an updated schedule under our doors
every morning of all the spiritual places
and temples that we need to see
and expedite hotels
and transportation and everything.
how's he gonna do that?
I had him bring a printer and a laminating machine.
where is he?
in a way, it actually doesn't matter.
he's in a different compartment on another part of the train,
but we never see him... ever.
that's more or less it.
three, please.
does that sound okay to you?
it sounds good, sure.
Yeah, it sounds good.
do you have any questions?
I do. okay, go ahead.
what happened to your face?
I only remember certain details,
but from what I've been able to reconstruct,
it was raining, I was going about 50 miles an hour
as I went into a corner, did some wrong steering,
wheels went out from me, and I suddenly, whoo,
skidded off the road, slammed into a ditch
and got catapulted 50 feet through the air.
little particles of glass and debris
were stinging my face as I flew.
and for a second, there was just total silence.
just...
then bam! the bike crashed to the ground,
exploded and caught on fire,
and I smashed into the side of a hill with my face.
I was driving home.
I live alone right now.
anyway, two joggers ran up and started digging out
all the dirt that was jammed inside my mouth
and my nose and my ears.
my brain had stopped, my heart had stopped,
so technically I was dead at this point.
they did all the procedures exactly right,
as a result of which I'm still alive.
the first thing I thought of when I woke up was,
I wish Peter and Jack were here.
have you heard anything from mom?
no.
have you?
no.
me neither.
fuck.
what's that?
some kind of Indian muscle relaxer.
I got it at the pharmacy next to the train station.
what's that?
you don't need a prescription here.
a type of indian flu medicine.
it's got a tranquilizer in it.
what's that?
strongest indian painkiller you can get.
it's for my face.
be careful with that.
you only want to take one drop.
I also lost a tooth.
you want to read a short story I wrote in France?
how long is it?
what?
how long is it? how long is it?
never mind. forget it.
you can save it till after dinner.
you know, maybe right before
whenever you're about to take out your tooth,
you should say something like, "please forgive this."
because it's, actually, it's kind of...
can... you... back away a little?
you just spit in my eye.
when was the last time you were in america, by the way?
I don't know.
the funeral.
in other words, a year?
I have to tell you,
I support this relationship not working out.
may I take your order, please?
let's see.
do we want meat or fish?
I'm gonna have the chicken.
Jack, you want to try the fish? I bet that's delicious.
and, Peter, the lamb?
a chicken, a fish and a lamb?
how does that sound?
who wants a soup? raise your hand.
are those dad's glasses?
Yeah.
you still have his prescription in here.
how can you see in these?
three soups.
soup.
could you not order for me, please?
what?
order for yourself.
what part are you on?
nothing.
it reminded me of something not related to it.
how's Alice?
she's fine.
she actually started this company
where she makes these little clay pots.
they're quite popular.
we sent you one.
Oh, yeah. yeah.
Oh, thank you.
I want that stewardess.
these Germans are bothering me.
ladies! please keep it down. lower your voices. thank you.
did I... raise us?
kind of?
hang on... I'm gonna ask this guy
if he can get me a power adapter.
she's pregnant.
Alice.
Really?
you're kidding. --no.
uh, how long?
seven and a half months.
so it's gonna be born in, like,
six weeks or something.
I think so, yeah.
I'm trying not to get too caught up in it right now.
don't tell Francis.
Brendan got the wrong voltage.
your soup, sir.
please forgive this.
is it supposed to be sad?
I think so.
well, I'm not too crazy about the part
where I start screaming at the mechanic.
that never happened.
the characters are all fictional.
may I take your dessert order, sir?
let's see.
do we want sweets or fruit?
I'm gonna have the pudding.
Jack, you want to try the cake?
and, peter, what looks good to you?
the cookies?
he's gonna order for himself.
the cookies.
excuse me, I'm...
has he been rooting around and taking things?
maybe.
I think he's still in mourning.
well, I probably am, too, but there's
something kind of unethical about it, isn't there?
legally those glasses
belong to all three of us.
I'm gonna take this bed,
because I'm the oldest and my ankle's fractured.
Peter, you don't mind climbing a ladder as I recall,
so why don't you set up shop topside?
and, Jack, you're a little bit of a lone wolf.
why don't you bunk out next door?
how does that sound?
Oh, sorry.
l was... stand up.
Brendan, this is Jack.
good evening. and this is Peter.
Hello, Brendan.
nice to meet you.
let's update me.
how's everything going back there?
pretty good. what does that mean?
I never heard back.
so try again. what are you waiting for?
well, I left a message.
why are you smiling?
what do you think he looks like
under all that tape and everything?
Brendan, what did I tell you?!
well, I don't know about his face,
but I think his brain might be pretty traumatized.
damn it!
come down to this spot over here.
call her again right now
and keep calling every ten minutes until you get through. okay.
this is urgent. we're almost there.
okay. and once again,
so we're explicitly clear,
I don't want you to mention this
or discuss it with anyone.
in other words, it's a surprise.
okay.
did you find me a power adapter?
not yet.
how long are you gonna stay here?
what do you mean?
he said till the end of the month.
why do you ask that?
I'm just trying to know so I can figure out my plans.
what plans?
I don't know yet.
anyways, I've got my own ticket, just in case.
don't tell Francis.
well, I'm not gonna stay here with just me and him.
is that one of Alice's pots?
Oh.
we should order some more of these.
I'll tell Brendan.
okay.
he has this disease where his head is shaved,
except he doesn't have to shave it
because he can't grow any hair in the first place.
don't... talk about it around him, though.
it might offend him.
are these dad's keys?
Yeah.
you've got his car keys, too?
Where's those nuts at?
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
good evening, Mr. Whitman. how can I help you?
is it possible for us to get some more
of those savoury snacks, please?
of course.
can I offer you anything else?
um... I don't think so.
I'll be right back.
I forgot something.
you want to smoke a cigarette with me in the bathroom?
you're crazy.
what's your name?
Jack. what's yours?
Rita.
you're beautiful.
don't come into me.
Jack's got his own return ticket.
he says he might leave early.
what are you talking about?
don't tell him I told you.
Brendan's got all the tickets.
there's a whole itinerary.
where is he going?
air italiano?
what the fuck is this?
I'm keeping his passport.
in fact, give me yours, too.
I want to keep all the passports
so nothing happens to them.
I'm keeping mine.
no. I want to keep them all together.
why are you standing there?
I'm waiting for you.
Mr. Whitman, the whole point
of us coming out separately
is so no one sees us together.
Jack.
Jack.
right. I get it. okay. good night, then.
go back to your compartment.
move over, please.
where are the savoury snacks?
huh?
did you just fuck that Indian girl?
what?
sweet lime.
of course not.
I went for a walk.
something just happened.
Shh! who's he talking to?
no one. he's got the code
to his exgirlfriend's answering machine,
and he's checking her messages.
what? when... when did he confide that to you?
just now.
why am I not a part of this?
I've never liked that girl.
me neither.
anyway, I never trusted her.
I don't feel good about myself.
okay. let's make another agreement.
on the spiritual journey, it's crucial
that we don't splinter into factions
or not include somebody
who has advice and may know better.
can we agree to that? okay.
what did you find out? nothing.
good.
she put this in my suitcase.
is that her?
Mm. that's her.
how did she gain access to your personal belongings?
she came to see me in France for 24 hours.
could she be gaslighting you?
what's gaslighting?
okay, hang on a second.
let's make another agreement.
from now on, if you want to talk to her
or check her messages, you speak to us first.
day or night. anytime. can you agree to that?
I think we should destroy that.
Jesus!
okay. all right.
let's check the itinerary.
give me a little light.
okay, here we go.
train stops first thing tomorrow morning
for an hour and 45 minutes,
which is just enough time for a quick visit
to temple of a thousand bulls,
probably one of the most spiritual places
in the entire world.
Wow.
power adapters!
can I get a power adapter?
Yes, yes, yes.
do you have a power adapter?
no, no. no power adapter.
use battery.
do you have these in, say, a tenandahalf medium?
these all size.
take off shoes and try.
Yeah, like that. that's good.
pepper spray. what ingredients does this have in it?
I don't want to kill anybody or anything.
no, no. not for killing.
spray in face.
okay. spray in face.
spray in face.
most rare, from desert.
very poisonous.
how much you want for him?
this is incredible.
ring it.
take some of these rupees and put them
on this thing in front of the deity here.
is that my belt?
can I borrow it?
well, no, not right now.
I was looking for that earlier.
ask first... next time. right.
Where's my passport?
I got pickpocketed.
my passport got stolen.
calm down.
it's not stolen. no, yes, it is.
it's gone. no, it's not.
I have it.
I'll be right back.
you stole my passport?
Peter, where are you going?
I'm going to go pray at a different thing.
I hear you're leaving early.
what are you talking about?
I thought we made an agreement.
that's why you stole my passport?
well, no, but I think we have a chance
to make this kind of a life changing experience,
and I think we need it.
in other words, I don't want you to leave.
he's going to have a kid in six weeks.
who? him, Rubby.
he doesn't want you to know. Rubby?
Yeah, you know, Rubby.
Yeah.
why doesn't he want me to know?
because we don't trust each other.
wow, right?
Yeah, amazing. great, thanks.
let's get a shoeshine.
Oh, hit it.
Hey. hey, come back here!
what? the kid just left...
who? he just...
get him!
he left his shoeshine kit. he...
well, now he can pay for this building.
those are $3, 000 loafers!
Yeah, but he only got one of them.
Yeah, but that's...
we're in an emergency here.
I got my face smashed in,
Jack's heart's been ripped to shreds,
and Rubby's having a child.
let's get into it.
you told him?
it's okay.
okay, that's what we're here for,
to start trusting each other.
I don't get it, by the way.
why aren't we celebrating?
cause I don't want to talk about it.
well, why not?
I guess because I always expected
eventually I'll get divorced, so having children...
really wasn't part of my plan.
okay, but you're never gonna do better than Alice,
and what's the point in getting married...
why'd you expect to get divorced?
I don't know. I love Alice.
maybe it relates to how we were raised.
I was gonna save this for later in the itinerary,
but I think it's time.
there's a ceremony I want us to do where we each
take one of these peacock feathers.
we're gonna go off into the wilderness
and meditate for...
damn it, I gave them to Brendan.
that's all right, we'll do it after the next stop.
those guys are laughing at us.
where?
I love it here.
these people are beautiful.
they're playing cricket with a tennis ball.
hello.
how do you do? hello.
it's great.
yeah? yeah.
it's so well written.
you remember everything so clearly.
Peter getting all Frantic getting the car started,
you with the suitcase.
the characters are all fictional.
well, anyway, I think it's the best thing
you've ever written.
thank you.
here are the peacock feathers,
plus some instructions from the Guru.
what's in that box?
he bought a snake.
it's got a skull and crossbones...
let's update me.
anything?
she got the message, yeah.
And?
what? that's it.
that's it. she got the message.
you're satisfied with that?
well, she knows you're coming.
does she want to see us?
but she's your mother.
happy birthday... from last year.
I can't accept this. it's too valuable.
it's got one wrong initial,
but you can paint over it.
it's from me and Jack.
yes?
would you like tea?
okay.
thank you.
you talk like Marlene Dietrich and you dance like Zizijeanmaire your clothes are all made by Balmain
I got to get off this train.
and there's diamonds and pearls in your hair yes, there are you live in a fancy apartment off the boulevard Saintmichel...
what's her name again?
Rita.
What'd you say?
there's a hole in it.
he escaped.
no, he didn't.
how?
Now，now you believe me, assholes?
we think a snake might have gotten on board.
but where do you go to, my lovely when you're alone in your bed
don't go in there, Rita.
you got him!
I'm kicking you off at the next station.
please don't do that.
we're very sorry. it won't happen again.
I know it won't.
what's that smell?
Voltaire number six.
do you have a prescription for these?
a prescription? I almost died.
give me a second.
where do you go to, my lovely when you're alone in your bed tell me the thoughts that surround you
that animal's deadly poisonous
and you brought him onto my train.
we didn't know. it was an accident.
we're just trying to experience something.
it's very important to us.
you're confined to your compartment
until further notice.
is our snake getting confiscated?
do you think it's working?
do we feel something?
I hope so. it's got to.
do you trust me?
where are we?
Brendan, what's going on?
I don't know. I guess the train's lost.
What'd he say?
he says the train's lost.
how can a train be lost? it's on rails.
apparently we took a wrong turn at some point last night.
that's crazy.
how far off course are we?
nobody knows... we haven't located us yet.
What'd you just say?
what?
what you just said. say it again.
we haven't located us yet.
Aah!
is that symbolic?
we... haven't located... us... yet.
Where's those feathers at?
in the envelope I gave you this morning.
meet me on top of that thing out there.
the Guru told me when the moon turns...
do you trust me?
I hired a private detective to track down mom.
she's living in a convent in the foothills of the Himalayas.
we'll be there in six days.
how is that possible?
I guess she became a nun, apparently.
you know what she's like.
a nun?
apparently.
did you talk to her?
no, I didn't.
does she know we're coming?
I think so.
how do you know she wants to see us?
she probably doesn't.
but maybe she does.
why didn't you tell us sooner?
because I'm trying to protect you
from all the painful emotions this is probably gonna stir up.
well, aren't you kind of doing that right now?
Yeah.
I'm scared, too.
she's obviously suffered some kind of mental collapse
and we've got to go get her and bring her back home.
actually, it's in the itinerary,
but I put it under TBD.
why are you laughing?
you didn't tell us cause we never
would've come here if we knew about it.
I'm gonna hold this in for a little while.
you gonna drink that whole bottle of cough medicine?
that's a dumb way to get loaded.
let's look at the itinerary.
fuck the itinerary.
you know, I think I'm gonna have to get that belt back after all.
because it cost me $6, 000 and it was made special for me.
we'll get you a different present.
I don't think so.
what is that supposed to mean?
it means there's been too much Indian giving over the years.
these guys are driving me crazy.
is there an empty compartment I can move into?
no, there isn't. we're fully booked.
I really want to kiss you right now. can i?
no.
no?
but we already... did it.
I have a boyfriend.
you do?
actually, I just broke up with him.
or I'm about to.
I really need someone to talk to right now.
and I feel like you might be very important to me in my life.
all right.
what did I tell you?
get back in your room.
what's happening? what do you mean?
I rang the bell. I'll be right there.
is that dad's razor?
Yeah.
can I say something?
what?
you don't have permission to take his property
that belongs to all of us and use it for yourself
as if it's yours.
Jack agrees with that. right, Jack?
Plus, dad would've hated it.
Why?
that's my opinion.
I knew him well.
that's a terrible thing to say.
well, I don't mean it to be.
I just don't want you to get the feeling
that you're better friends with him than we are
or something weird like that.
and, also, you can't leave your wife
just because she's pregnant.
Jack agrees with that, too. right, Jack?
stop including me.
I was his favorite.
he told me that with blood all over him laying in the street
right before he died.
how is that supposed to make us feel?
I want my passport back.
Francis?
yeah?
here's your belt.
fuck. stop!
you don't love me! yes, I do!
I love you, too, but I'm gonna mace you in the face!
stop!
I had to do it!
Jack! you maced us!
stop including me!
I'll find us a hotel.
next train's in 24 hours.
this just came in.
why are your eyes all red?
why is your head so bald?
because I have alopecia.
Oh, yeah.
that's like albino, right?
not really.
Jack maced us.
was I just mean to Brendan?
he's not coming back.
he just quit.
he did, didn't he?
can we at least get our snake back?
it's dead.
you killed him?
your fake tooth's gone.
fuck.
what did you say?
shame on you.
did you get maced, too?
no, I'm crying.
what's wrong with you?
let me think about that.
I'll tell you the next time I see you.
sure, tell me then.
thanks for using me.
you're welcome.
goodbye, Rita.
so long, sweet lime.
dear boys...
bad timing.
this morning I received the details of your travel plans
in a document sent to me from a man named Brendan.
unfortunately, I cannot receive you now.
a neighboring village requires our urgent assistance
due to an emergency, not to mention the recent
arrival of a maneating tiger in the region.
I suggest you come in the spring
when you'll be safe with me.
you must know how sad I am
to experience this long separation.
I hope you'll eventually understand and forgive me.
God bless you and keep you with mary's benevolent guidance
in the light of Christ's enduring grace.
all my love, your mother,
sister Patricia Whitman.
that sounds like bullshit to me.
me, too. obviously.
she's trying to sell us a vacuum cleaner.
let's get high.
I'm sorry.
me, too.
I wasn't trying to aim for your face.
doesn't matter, it's already demolished.
let's just go home.
she doesn't want to see us anyway.
you don't think so?
not even on some primordial level?
no.
she's been disappearing all our lives.
we weren't raised to be treated like that.
it's just not done.
maybe this is how it's supposed to happen.
it could all be part of it.
maybe this is where the spiritual journey ends.
you read the instructions,
right?
okay, let's do it.
I'm gonna go over here.
Yeah, that's good, get on the rock. yeah.
Yeah. yeah, okay. Peter, you get... yeah.
everybody ready? yeah. yeah.
Ah! oh! shalom.
okay, that's it. that's it.
okay.
well, all right.
which direction did yours go?
what do you mean?
your feathers.
mine blew towards the mountains.
that's not right... it's not supposed to get blown away.
you're supposed to blow on it...
and then bury it.
I didn't get that.
I still have mine.
you guys didn't do it right.
I asked you if you read the instructions.
you did it wrong.
I tried my hardest.
I don't know what else to do.
I don't think dad would have hated it.
did he really say you were his favorite?
I don't know.
I could barely understand him.
he wasn't really breathing.
I wonder if the three of us
could have been friends in real life.
not as brothers but as people.
well, we probably would've had a better chance, I guess.
we'll all come back here in the spring when...
we're never coming back here.
let's just find an airport and go our separate ways.
wouldn't it sound great if you could hear a train
going by off in the distance right now?
not really. probably be annoying.
look at these assholes.
that's gonna tip over.
go!
get the little one.
Francis!
grab him!
don't let go of me.
he's all tangled up.
hang on, hang on. I got you.
I can't get him out!
Peter!
he's all bloody!
he's dead. he's dead.
he's dead? the rocks killed him.
you're bleeding like crazy.
Peter! you okay?
I didn't save mine.
what's his name?
Papa! papa! hey!
no.
thank you.
can you explain that I almost had him?
I lost him when we went off the rocks.
he was too slippery.
I had him the whole rest of the time.
I want them to know that.
what you doing in this place?
well, originally, I guess,
we came here on a spiritual journey,
but that didn't really pan out.
we're invited to the funeral.
okay.
where you going?
I don't mind?
I've killed my world and I've killed my time?
so where do I go?
what will I see?
I see many people coming after me?
so where are you going to?
I don't mind?
if I live too long?
I'm afraid I'll die?
so I will follow you?
wherever you go?
if your offered hand?
is still open to me?
strangers on this road we are on?
we are not two, we are one?
so you've been where I've just come?
from the land that brings losers on?
so we will share this road we walk?
and mind our mouths and beware our talk?
till peace we find, tell you what I'll do?
all the things I own, I will share with you?
and if I feel tomorrow like I feel today?
we'll take what we want?
and give the rest away?
I can't believe you just said that.
why not? it's the truth.
he didn't really mean it.
I think you're all equally griefstricken.
let's just leave it at that.
when does mom get in?
she's going straight there
from the airport.
I want to pick up the car.
we're already late.
tell the driver to take a right. we don't have time.
let's do this later. --No. I want to get it now.
uh, excuse me?
I'm sorry, uh, we're gonna need to make a stop first
at this address.
go ahead... I'll be right behind you.
I think we should wait for you.
Why?
Francis.
tell them we'll be there in five minutes.
Hey, hey...
Hey.
Yeah, we're here to pick up Mr. Whitman's car.
no, Mr. Whitman's car is not ready.
what do you mean, it's not ready?
no, we're waiting for... a part.
a part? yeah.
uh, I left a message with his secretary.
no, no, no, that's crazy.
this car's been here for three months.
he can't wait any longer.
he'll have to wait another week.
uh, I left a message.
Yeah, he didn't get the message.
Mr. Whitman is dead. you understand?
Jimmy Whitman?
Yeah.
what happened to him?
he got hit by a taxi.
and it killed him?
Yeah.
his change was scattered all over 72nd street.
Oh, you're his sons.
right. and we're gonna take this car
to his funeral, which we're late for, right now.
where are the keys?
Peter, we'll come back later and get the car.
it's not ready, right?
it's not ready.
the battery's dead, too.
there it is.
that's the other one. we found it.
we're still waiting for a part to come in from Stuttgart.
Where's a battery charger?
what are you doing?
this one's mine. no, it's not.
we need to take it home and enter it in the inventory.
I'm taking this suitcase.
you going somewhere?
I don't know.
Where's the goddamn battery charger?
Ah, aha!
guess he didn't read my book in time.
what do you mean? in time for what?
the envelope's never been opened.
Oh, you mean when he was still alive.
phone call for a Francis Whitman.
hello.
they want to start.
send the car back for us. the battery's dead.
they can only wait ten minutes.
there's another service after us.
okay, well, we might not make it, then.
I guess just...
tell 'em to go fuck themselves.
hold the line.
no, you're going to start when they get here,
not one second before.
is that perfectly clear? is that perfectly clear?
try to be quick.
okay.
wait a second. yes?
I spoke to your mother. she's not coming.
she didn't get on the plane.
why not?
I don't know. I'm sorry.
will you tell Peter and Jack, so they don't expect to see her?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Thanks, Alice.
thank you.
you're welcome.
put it in second.
put it in second!
pop it!
watch it, asshole!
what do you want?
are you kidding me?
fuck, no.
you get back in your car right now.
get back in that car!
this isn't gonna work.
let's put the cover back on it. let's go.
come on. steer it in.
let's go.
who called?
Alice.
What'd she say?
they're waiting.
mom there?
not yet.
Hey, help him up.
you okay?
let me help you.
Whitman.
the flight boards in 25 minutes.
let's set aside the next ten minutes to use as free time.
do a little shopping, have a snack,
make a phone call, and then we'll meet in the bathroom
next to that statue over there at about a quarter after,
get cleaned up, brush your teeth,
have a shave or what have you, and in our last five minutes
we'll sit quietly in that little shrine over there,
say a prayer and think about everything we've been through.
in Hindi
three, please.
I love the way this country smells.
I'll never forget it.
it's kind of spicy.
who's he talking to?
I think he's trying to rehire Brendan.
he said he's gonna offer him a 50% raise
plus some medical benefits to help with his albino disease
or whatever it's called.
how'd it go?
he's gonna think about it.
he's gotta get hired back, because otherwise
I'm probably just a bad person.
and in some ways I feel like Brendan
might be my... friend maybe.
I'll be right back.
he didn't really kill our snake, did he?
I mean, it's gotta be against his religion.
I bet he just sent him
out into the desert, which is...
actually closer to his natural habitat.
who's he talking to?
probably checking his exgirlfriend's messages again.
I thought we made an agreement.
why didn't you stop him?
What'd you find out this time?
she's gonna meet me in Italy.
Oh, man, that's terrible.
I know.
I'll be right back.
let's look at the itinerary.
indistinct.
is that from sweet lime?
who's he talking to?
I didn't say that.
I didn't want... hello?
Alice, I guess.
it's a boy.
it got born already?
it's gonna be a boy.
she had a sonogram or something.
it's a boy?
that's incredible!
why were you yelling?
she's angry 'cause I didn't tell her I was coming here.
ever? until just now?
Yeah.
but I explained everything.
it's actually kind of lucky cause I got this vest.
it can work with either one,
but I think it's better for a man.
here, he can inherit this.
it's from me and Jack.
Thanks.
can I use those scissors?
I guess I've still got some more healing to do.
you're getting there, though.
anyway, it's definitely gonna add
a lot of character to you.
what should we pray for now?
conversation.
didn't you get my letter?
I told you to come back in the spring.
should we go?
of course not.
welcome, my beautiful boys.
Francie, Peter, little Jack.
what happened to your face?
I smashed into a hill on purpose on my motorcycle.
I'm sorry to hear that.
there's so many things
we don't know about each other, aren't there?
who's this?
that's Oberoi. he got us here.
whoa, whoa, wait a second.
what are you saying to him?
I'm telling him to lock up your horses.
there's a tiger.
Really? we thought that was bullshit.
you call that bullshit?
he ate one of the sister's brothers.
I'm not kidding.
praise him praise him, praise him in the morning praise him when the sun goes down love him, love him love him in the morning, love him in the noontime love him, love him.
what do we want for breakfast?
Jack, you'll like the porridge,
Peter, fresh mango, and cornflakes for you, Francie.
now who wants scrambled eggs? raise your hand.
what's on fire in that hideous little flowerpot?
Alice made that.
Oh, it's darling.
tell her I said so.
okay. you want one?
of course I do.
everybody knows but don't play with me 'cause you're playing with fire your mother, she's...
mom?
there's one last thing.
I want to tell you about my son.
what son?
the one I'm gonna have next month.
well, you should be with alice.
you should have been at dad's funeral.
so that's why you came here.
we came here because we miss you.
I miss you, too.
but why didn't you come to dad's funeral?
because I didn't want to.
why are we talking this way?
what's wrong with us?
we should be celebrating.
what are you doing here?
I live here.
these people need me.
what about us?
you're talking to her.
you're talking to someone else.
you're not talking to me.
I don't know the answers to these questions
and I don't see myself this way.
listen.
I'm sorry we lost your father.
we'll never get over it, but it's okay.
there are greater forces at work.
Yes, the past happened, but it's over, isn't it?
not for us.
I told you not to come here.
maybe we could express ourselves more fully
if we say it without words.
should we try that well, you've got your diamond and you've got your pretty clothes and the chauffeur drives your cars you let everybody know but don't play with me 'cause you're playing with fire your mother, she's an heiress owns a block in St.John's Wood and your father'd be there with her if he only could but don't play with me 'cause you're playing with fire her old man took her diamonds and tiaras by the score?
now she gets her kicks in Stepney not in Knightsbridge anymore so don't you play with me 'cause you're playing with fire so don't you play with me 'cause you're playing with fire so don't you play with me 'cause you're playing with fire.
all right, let's make an agreement.
we'll get an early start tomorrow morning
and try to enjoy each other's company here
in this beautiful place.
we'll stop feeling sorry for ourselves.
it's not very attractive.
we'll make our plans for the future.
can we agree to that?
sure. yeah. okay.
to be continued.
good morning.
she's gone.
what?
she's gone.
I was still asleep, but Oberoi saw her go.
Peter.
what?
she's gone.
who?
she's gone?
where?
they couldn't say.
they just said she goes away sometimes.
she left our breakfast in the doorway.
I'm working on a new short story.
I wrote the ending, but I don't know how it starts.
read us what you got.
"whatever happens in the end," she said, "I don't want to lose you as my friend."
he looked into her eyes.
I promise I will never be your friend, "no matter what, ever."
her voice cracked.
lf we fuck, I'm gonna feel like shit tomorrow.
"that's okay with me.," he said.
he lifted her shirt over her head.
I love you,' she said.
I never hurt you on purpose.
he nodded. I don't care.
he would not be going to Italy.
that sound okay?
Yeah. it's hard for me to judge the ending
without knowing the rest of it.
I like how mean you are.
well, the characters are all...
Thanks.
that's our train.
Hurry!
dad's bags aren't gonna make it!
I know a man, he's a powerful man got the people in his power in the palm of his hand he started at the bottom and he worked his way up now he's never gonna stop until he reaches the top it's the same old story it's the same old dream it's power, man, power, man, and all that it can bring if you want your money, better stand in the line but you'll only end up picking up the nickels and dimes.
good morning. Whitman?
may I see your ticket, please?
welcome aboard.
thank you.
sweet lime?
why not?
why don't you hang onto mine?
it's safer if you keep them.
let's go get a drink and smoke a cigarette.
shit.
goddamn city.
Oh, no.
Hello, Mike.
good-bye, Mike.
somebody help!
what's going on? - A murder.
do you want some?
Oops.
well, I guess I'd better punt.
what the hell is that down there? - You got your flashlight, Joey?
Oh, look at this shit, man. Jesus fucking Christ.
this the guy we're supposed to cover? - How the fuck should I know?
Christ!
this is really some shit, man.
forget about it. - Who was that?
I don't know. He's gone.
Oh, we're gonna take some hell for this.
good mornin', Rick.
this is the man who cut your woman's throat.
what?
who are you?
ask Thad Beaumont who I am.
he knows all about it.
tell him I said you were walkin' around dead.
and tell him I'm not done makin' fool's stuffing yet.
wait a minute. Who are you?
Oh, God.
have a good one, man.
Jesus Christ.
you asshole!
so tell me, Thad, who do you think is doing this?
give me a name. - I gave you a name.
the name is George Stark.
I don't think I understand you.
what my husband is trying to say is...
that he thinks George Stark has somehow come to life.
I don't expect you to be the type of guy that's gonna believe this...
but you're all we've got right now.
Thad has some things he's gonna tell you. You don't have to believe him.
but you have to trust him. You have to trust that he believes.
because if you don't, this man-- or whatever he is out there
is gonna go on killing, and he's gonna keep on killing...
till he gets to me and Thad and the babies.
come on, honey.
you don't believe it, do you?
not a single word of it.
if you had told me these people were murdered by a ghost...
I wouldn't believe you...
but I can come closer to believing a ghost story than this.
you're not just talking about a ghost.
you're talking about a man who never was.
maybe you'd like to tell me where this guy came from.
did you just sort of give birth to him one night?
did he pop out of a damn sparrow's egg?
exactly how did it go?
I don't know when he became a separate person.
it was when we tried to kill him.
look, I'm willing to consider all sorts of crazy possibilities here...
but when you tell me this guy is George Stark
he might think he's George Stark. I'll give you that.
but he's not. He can't be.
he's a crazy man, Thad.
a goddamn homicidal lunatic crazy man is what he is.
and I'm gonna catch him.
hold it, Mr. Cowley. The guys from communication are supposed to be here.
maybe they're inside. - One of 'em, maybe.
but the other one should be out here. It's standard procedure.
come on.
maybe they never showed up. - Who knows?
let's try to get 'em on the radio. They coming from downtown?
I don't know. Call the precinct.
I gotta get some sleep. I'm dead. - We'll be here.
maybe we'll send out for Chinese later.
my treat. - Thanks.
Jesus Christ.
I've decided to change agents.
sorry, Rick.
it's a cutthroat business.
God. Jesus.
Rick is gone?
I don't believe this. I can't believe this.
so much for your fucking police protection!
what do you got there? - Bullshit!
bullshit! They didn't!
no, they didn't. I don't care what you think!
you wanna think about something? Think about what I told you. Huh?
think about George Stark. Think about that.
what does he want?
he wants the same thing you and I would want if we were in the same position.
do you understand? He doesn't want to be dead anymore!
Jesus. Rick. Miriam.
who's next?
I think that's everything, Mr. Beaumont. Mrs. Beaumont.
we'll call from the outside to make sure the system's working.
okay, fine. Thank you.
good, we don't have to make a test call. Pull your meter. I'll check it out.
somebody gonna answer it?
Mr. Beaumont.
something the matter?
it's him. - It's who?
what do you want, you son of a bitch?
cool down. No need to get your panties in a bunch.
what do you want? - Just to tell you it's over.
I got the last one at noon. Little girl who worked for your publisher.
the one who spilled it to Clawson.
the cops will find her. Some of her's on the floor. Rest is on the table.
Jesus Christ!
I'm gonna head back down south, do some fishing.
this city life's tiring me out. - He's lying. You lying fuck.
that's not very nice. Did you think I was gonna hurt you?
hell, no. I was getting revenge for you, boy...
cause you knew all along I was the one that had to do it.
I know you got a chicken liver. - He's lying. He knows you're listening.
I'm not gonna bother you anymore, Thad.
I know you're gonna come after us.
I know you're gonna come after me.
I think I know what you want.
you just come ahead.
I'll know you're coming.
I'll know because I'll hear the birds.
birds? - That's right, I'll hear the birds.
I'll know you're coming, and I'll be waiting for you...
to fucking take you apart.
dear God.
what do you mean, you'll hear the birds?
the sparrows, George. Don't you hear the sparrows?
whatever you're talking about, it doesn't matter because...
this is over now.
we got it. Clear as a bell.
great. Let's check the van.
call was made from a pay phone in Times Square.
checked to see if the voice on the other end of the line was a tape recording.
what? Made by me?
your calling card number was used to pay for the call.
Jesus, after all this, I'm still a suspect.
I know they can't hang last night's work on you. You were here.
but they think maybe you're working with an accomplice.
now that is the craziest fucking thing I ever heard.
I wish I could say the same thing, Thad.
you gave me a description, remember? - Hmm?
the witness at Donaldson's says the killer matches that description.
he told me he was driving a black Toronado.
used car place where they found Homer's pickup says it was a black Toronado...
that was stolen off their lot.
that and the fingerprints.
the fact that you named the victims before they were killed.
Jesus Christ, man. What do you expect people to think?
what do you think, Alan?
I think there's some psycho out there who's got it in for you.
somebody clever enough to go digging around in your life...
to find out things he could use to make you look guilty.
it's either that, or it's you.
it could be that somehow you are behind all this.
don't think I've written that possibility off because I haven't.
you better write it off.
and you better stop looking at me and start looking over your shoulder.
what's coming up behind you, it could be real unhealthy for you if you don't.
how you doin', Mr. Beaumont? - I've been better, Rosalie.
Hello?
it's for you, Mr. Beaumont.
Hello, George.
Thad, how's it hangin'? - What do you want?
you know the answer to that. You figured it out, figured right.
it's time to start a new book.
I don't think so. I'm finished with you. George Stark is dead.
I'm not dead, Hoss.
not hardly. I'm just gettin' started.
better do what I say, or I'll be comin' for you.
you will die like no other man on Earth has ever died before.
start another book, boy. Go home and sharpen your pencils.
any calls? - None that matter.
I'll be over at home.
guess I'll have to call you back, Sheriff.
God. Oh, Jesus, Annie.
I'm sorry. Darling, I'm sorry.
it's okay.
God. I didn't realize how jumpy I've been getting.
this Beaumont business.
what's he like, Beaumont?
how do you know? How do you ever know?
I'm taking him to work. Maybe you should send another unit to watch the house.
Ten-four. Right away.
come on over. Come on. Get over here. That's good.
here, look at this.
no, if you can't
here, this is your favorite toy. Come on. Would you guys please be quiet?
just please be-- Would you guys please shut up!
Hey, I'll be a couple hours.
you want some coffee? - I've got my Thermos.
let me in, George.
come on, George. Let me come visit for a while.
let me see what the hell you're up to.
come on, George.
they're real.
the sparrows are real.
why do you want to write again?
why do you say that?
falling apart?
how?
tell me...
why.
what?
smarts, don't it, Thad?
hurts like a real son of a bitch.
I sure hope you can take it, Hoss.
y eah.
take it like a man.
Oh, yeah.
like a man.
where are you going? - Bangor.
what's in Bangor?
I don't know. Maybe nothing. That's where I had surgery as a boy.
here. Take these.
a disguise.
a changed man. Car key.
have the decency to stand good for repairs if it comes back wounded.
how will you get home? - A cab, I imagine.
let me give you some money.
I'll get a receipt and present it to you at the proper moment.
Thanks, old friend. - Thank you for bringing adventure.
just for chuckles, see if you can find anything in your books about sparrows.
sparrows.
there is something about sparrows.
a twin?
they never told you? - No, they said it was a tumor.
well, in a way, that's all it was.
foreign matter that happened to wind up in your head.
I don't see anything, Thad...
but if you're hearing things again, we better shoot some pictures.
a great many of us start out as twins. At least one in ten.
probably more.
the stronger fetus absorbs the weaker and comes to birth as a single child.
in your case...
the fetus wasn't completely absorbed...
and it had to be removed surgically.
your mom and dad were pretty rattled by the whole thing.
they insisted that the excised tissue...
be treated as human remains and signed over to them.
they wanted to bury it. - Bury it.
in the Homeland Cemetery. In the family plot.
don't know.
they ever tell you about the sparrows?
sparrows? - It was the damnedest thing.
we just finished your surgery...
and this enormous flock of sparrows-- thousands of them
came swarming down onto the hospital.
they never figured out what the hell it was.
some kind of migration or something.
made a hell of a mess. Windows broke.
three or four people got hurt.
you're bleeding pretty good there.
let me put a proper dressing on that.
what did you say it was, a cut?
no, I poked myself.
y eah, it'll stick in my mind forever.
you complaining about those bird sounds...
and us getting hit by those sparrows.
it was like...
when we took the sound out of your head, and it came to life.
howdy, Doc.
remember me?
Jesus.
you bastard.
Jesus!
Hello? - Liz...
you gotta get out of there right now.
Thad, what are you talking-- - Listen. Stark is here in Bangor.
that's 20 minutes away. You got to get the hell out of there right now.
wait a minute. What are you doing in Bangor?
please! Just listen to me!
get out of there. There's no time. He's killed Doc Pritchard.
what? -He's gonna come after you and the kids.
get out of there.
all right, we'll go. - Promise me.
I promise you, we'll go. We'll go now.
you don't need to pack anything. Just get the hell out of there.
wait a minute. How am I supposed to get in touch with you?
through the school. Just-- Reggie.
don't tell her where you're going or where you are. Tell her you're safe.
don't tell anyone who might tell me where you are.
I can't know. Do you understand me?
I cannot know where you are. - All right, we'll go.
I love you, Liz.
I love you. I love you more than anything.
I love
okay.
listen, Mommy's gonna take you on a little ride.
shit.
Twenty-six, await further instruction.
I got a dispatch. Give me a code six.
there's been a-- You better call an ambulance.
there's-- - Ambulance?
call an ambulance.
for God's sake, we're in danger, Alan. My babies are in danger.
I can't let you just go running off. Even if I wanted to, I couldn't let you.
but Stark could be out there.
there is no George Stark. He doesn't exist.
goddamn it, somebody exists, because Thad said he saw him!
I don't give a damn what Thad said.
by rights, your husband ought to be in the county jail...
and I'm starting to feel like an idiot for not putting him there long ago.
now you're just gonna have to sit tight and ride this out.
nothing is going to happen to you. You're under police protection.
am I under protection, or am I under arrest?
you call it what you like. I'm sorry.
I've been way too soft on this thing. I've got to start going by the book.
let me talk to the officer there.
he wants to talk to you.
y es, sir. - You just hold the fort.
I'll have two units out to replace you before nightfall.
keep your eyes open.
if Thad Beaumont shows up, you pull him in on suspicion, murder one.
y es, sir. Got it covered.
I think the absorbed fetus was merely a vessel.
a stolen body, if you like.
it just happened to be there, wholly by accident, and Stark used it.
he took it for his own.
stark is a conjuration, an entity created...
by the force of your will.
we all have something of the beast inside us.
we can either suppress it or encourage it.
in your case, you encouraged it too much.
in your subconscious, you wanted it to live.
you wanted it so badly, it actually came to be.
your characters have always been vividly written, Thad.
I wanted him to live.
God forgive me, it's true.
a part of me has always admired George Stark.
admired his simple, violent nature.
a man who doesn't stumble over things, who never looks weak or silly.
a man with a straight, sharp answer for everything.
y es, but he's a bastard.
half of me is a bastard.
my dark half.
george Stark is my dark half.
y eah, but surely you don't want him to stay alive.
I mean, you can't still admire him after all that he's done.
if you don't want him here, he can't remain.
you're the one with life. Real life.
he's trying to take it away from you...
but if you're not willing to give it up, what can he do?
kill you?
that would be suicide, wouldn't it?
why didn't I see that? He can't hurt me.
that's why he's going after the people around me.
exactly.
I found something in Barringer's here.
something about sparrows.
Whippoorwills...
Ioons and sparrows...
are psychopomps.
what?
from the Greek. It means "those who conduct.
in this case, those who conduct human souls...
back and forth...
between the land of the living and the land of the dead.
Hello?
it's for you.
I'm not gonna write your book, George. Why not accept it?
you're dead. And dead you're gonna stay.
you're wrong, old Hoss. You want to get started.
you want to get started by nightfall, or you're gonna be a sorry son of a bitch.
and you won't be the only one.
let's see if you can figure out where I'm calling from, Thad.
that was quick, Hoss. - What have you done to them?
not a thing, yet. Not to your people.
I had to do a few things to that state trooper, the one watching your house.
what's left of him is out there in his bubble-mobile drawing flies.
let me talk to Liz. - No time. Gotta go, buddy-roo.
me and the family, we gotta ride.
I think you know where we'll all be headin'.
Endsville, Thad.
that place where all rail service terminates.
Oh, in case you're wonderin', I cut the tracer on your phone here.
I figured this is private business, just between you and me.
the trace.
Jesus, the phone trace.
they heard my call. They wouldn't let her go. He's got Liz.
and he's got my children.
be careful, Thaddeus.
remember, he knows as much about you as you know about him.
don't let him seduce you. Don't
they've come to take one of us away, haven't they? Which one?
the loser, of course.
I do hope it's not you, Thaddeus.
I'd hate to think of George Stark taking over your lecture group.
why isn't he aware of them? - I don't know.
let's take it as a good sign.
I thought you knew about this shit.
I don't know about any of it. Nobody does, except the Almighty...
and He seems to be on sabbatical.
in the end, it's what you believe.
I wish I had a talisman to give you or a silver bullet...
or a stake to drive through the monster's heart...
but I'm afraid it's not that simple.
you've given me all the weapons I need. Thanks, Reggie.
good luck, Thaddeus.
be interesting to see who's sitting in your office next week.
I'll be there.
wear a red carnation so I know it's you.
I got a dead officer here. I call that trouble.
we're pretty sure Beaumont did it. - What makes you think that?
well, he's out of here.
he apparently took his family with him, unless he cut them up too.
he killed that doctor over in Bangor. We got a positive l. D.
listen, if he's heading to his place up there...
it would be real nice if you were there to stop his fucking clock.
you got it. Fine.
Oh, shit.
just keep on goin'. Keep on goin'.
me and Thad, we're gonna be doing some collaborating, that's all, like always.
and when it's all over, if you haven't pissed me off too bad...
I might just decide to let you go.
you understand, it all depends on what kind of mood I'm in.
if I'm in a good mood, a peaceful mood...
who knows what kind of turn things might take?
when all this is over, I might be settling down up this way...
and I sure would want you to think kindly of me.
I like it here. I purely do.
y eah, I could get real comfortable here.
dream on, motherfucker.
this is no dream, Beth.
Thad owes me.
you know, maybe he knew how to write before I showed up...
but I'm the one that taught him how to write the stuff people wanna read.
ain't no good writin' a thing if people don't want to read it.
that's why I says Thad owes me.
so you come after me, you come after my children.
you're a coward.
you would do better not to say things like that.
you know, I didn't want any of this trouble.
believe it or not, I prefer to steer south of trouble.
this writin' we gotta do, I tried to do it by myself.
it was comin' along good too.
well, then I developed this...
physical problem.
I guess you noticed.
don't worry. I'll be better soon.
Thad's gonna make me well.
all he's got to do is write this one last story...
and I'll be rockin' and rollin' again.
now, of course, he might start feeling poorly.
you know, working so close together and all...
he might just go and catch whatever this is that I got.
that'd be a shame.
I don't wish the boy any harm.
surely I don't. I hope it turns out different.
but I got the feeling that one or the other of us...
is gonna have to fold his hand.
and when it comes down to that, it's better him than me.
my God.
Oh, my God. You really are-- - You're disturbing my peaceful mood.
you are disturbing the peaceful frame of mind I'm in.
you are disturbing my peaceful frame of mind.
Oh, God, Liz.
are you all right? Are you okay?
where are the kids? - Right here, Hoss.
Hello, Thad.
how are you, old buddy? You look a little peaky.
you don't look so hot yourself.
if I do what you want me to do...
you promise not to hurt them?
if I do what you want...
will you leave them alone?
I will. I promise.
you have my word...
the word of a Southern man, which is not given lightly.
let me have them. - You can have one.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry for all this.
I'm gonna go upstairs with him.
no, Thad, you can't.
we don't have a choice.
he can't hurt me. He won't.
but he can hurt you if you give him a reason.
now don't be thinking about breaking loose or the telephone.
guess we're on the same wavelength. Ain't that right, Thad?
don't you see what's happening? Just look at him.
he doesn't want help writing a book.
he wants to take over your life. Can't you see that?
I know what he wants.
what I don't know and he doesn't know is whether this will really save him.
I don't think it will save him. I think he's finished.
you know why?
cause I don't want him around anymore.
there's only one way to find out who's finished and who's not.
ain't that right, Thad?
are you ready?
just waiting on you.
y eah.
I'll start with Machine stealing the police car.
that's right.
give me a cigarette.
I thought you quit.
I did.
except for times like this.
times when me and you are working together.
why don't you try it, George?
you gotta break in.
I'm scared, Hoss.
you know, the only way to do it...
is to do it.
it's comin', Thad.
it's comin' easy.
it's comin' good. I can do it.
you shouldn't fuck with me, Hoss.
don't you know I can tell what you're thinking?
stop it, Thad.
stop it, or I'm gonna have to cut you.
you're not gonna cut me. You can't do shit to me, and you know it.
I can do some shit to other folks around here.
y es, sir, I can do some real ugly shit to them.
sit down.
make it easy on yourself.
sit down and shut your eyes.
see if you can't just...
drift on off.
you go to hell.
they're coming to take you away, George.
take you back to the devil.
okay. You sit here. I gotta open the door now.
I didn't want it to be like this, Hoss.
I had a different sort of thing in mind, yes, I did.
they've come to write the ending, George.
is it going to be your ending or mine?
kinda clumsy there, George.
I'm gonna give you...
one last chance here, Thad.
you just stop this. Stop whatever it is you're doin' here.
I'm not doing anything, Hoss.
y eah, I'm just waiting around to see how things turn out.
stop it. - Sorry, George, I can't.
neither can you.
the ending, huh?
see how you like this ending, Hoss.
hurry up!
what the hell is going on here? What is this?
they're upstairs.
who? - He took them upstairs.
Where's Thad? - He's upstairs. He's with Stark.
hold still! - Hurry. He's got the kids upstairs.
wait! Wait here!
GRUMPY: Three of a kind, let's do this. CHUCKLES: That's it? Three guys?
GRUMPY: Two guys on the roof. Every guy gets a share. Five shares is plenty.
CHUCKLES: Six shares. Don't forget the guy who planned the job.
GRUMPY: He thinks he can sit it out and still take a slice.
I know why they call him the Joker. HAPPY: Why do they call him the Joker?
DOPEY: I heard he wears makeup. HAPPY: Makeup?
DOPEY: Yeah, to scare people. You know, war paint.
GRUMPY: All right, everybody, hands up, heads down!
I said, hands up, heads down!
let's go, pal, I'm making a withdrawal here.
I said, hands up! - No!
DOPEY: Here comes the silent alarm.
and there it goes.
GRUMPY: Heads down!
all right, tootsie, you're taking a dive with me.
down! I said, stay down there! WOMAN: Don't hurt me!
DOPEY: Funny, it didn't dial 911. It was trying to reach a private number.
happy: Is it a problem? DOPEY: No, I'm done here.
GRUMPY: Sit down! Down!
down! I said, stay down there!
GRUMPY: Obviously we don't want you doing anything with your hands...
...other than holding on for dear life.
CHUCKLES: On the ground! Stay on the ground!
nobody make a move! Nobody! Stay down!
you have any idea who you're stealing from?
you and your friends are dead. GRUMPY: He's out, right?
GRUMPY: What...?
where did you learn to count?
happy: They wired this thing up with like 5000 volts.
what kind of bank does that?
GRUMPY: A Mob bank. I guess the Joker's as crazy as they say.
Where's the alarm guy?
happy: Boss told me when the guy was done, I should take him out.
one less share, right?
GRUMPY: Funny, he told me something similar.
happy: He what? No! No!
GRUMPY: That's a lot of money.
if this Joker guy was so smart, he'd have had us bring a bigger car.
I'm betting the Joker told you to kill me soon as we loaded the cash.
BOZO: No, no, no, I kill the bus driver.
GRUMPY: Bus driver?
what bus driver?
driver: School's out. Time to go.
that guy's not getting up, is he?
that's a lot of money.
what happened to the rest of the guys?
manager: You think you're smart, huh?
the guy that hired youse...
...he'll just do the same to you.
Oh, criminals in this town used to believe in things.
honor...
...respect.
look at you. What do you believe in, huh?
what do you believe in?!
I believe whatever doesn't kill you simply makes you...
...stranger.
man 1: Mr. Mayor, you were elected in a campaign to clean up the city.
when are you gonna start? MAN 2: I already have.
man 1: Like this Batman.
we're hearing he's doing good, criminals are running scared.
no, man. I don't like it tonight. - What are you, superstitious?
you got more chance of winning the Powerball than running into him.
that's not true. Our men in the Major Crimes Unit are close to an arrest.
Hey, Wuertz, mayor says you're closing in on the Batman.
the investigation is ongoing.
I pledged in my campaign, uh, to have...
ever intending to see your wife again, lieutenant?
I thought you had to go look after your mother, detective.
checked her back into the hospital.
I'm sorry.
so he hasn't shown up? - He often doesn't.
I like reminding everybody he's out there.
why wouldn't he come?
hopefully...
...because he's busy.
that's why we bring dogs.
my little princes. MAN: Please.
please, they're crawling in my mouth. Please, I beg you, get them off.
CHECHEN: Look what your drugs do to my customers.
SCARECROW: Buyer beware.
I told you my compound would take you places.
I never said they'd be places you wanted to go.
my business, repeat customers.
SCARECROW: You don't like what I have to offer...
...you can buy from someone else.
assuming Batman left anyone to buy from.
my dogs are hungry.
pity there's only one of you.
CHECHEN: What...? SCARECROW: That's not him.
loose the dogs!
SCARECROW: That's more like it.
don't let me find you out here again.
we're trying to help you. BATMAN: I don't need help.
not my diagnosis.
what gives you the right? What's the difference between you and me?
I'm not wearing hockey pads.
officer: Everybody back now!
he can't resist showing us his face.
GORDON: What's he hiding under that makeup?
ramirez: Uh, can we get a minute, people, please?
him again. Who are the others?
another bunch of smalltimers.
batman: Some of the marked bills I gave you.
my detectives have been making drug buys with them.
this bank was another drop for the Mob. That makes five.
we found the bulk of their dirty cash. - Time to move in.
we'd have to hit all banks simultaneously. SWAT teams, backup.
what about this Joker guy?
one man or the entire Mob? He can wait.
when the new DA hears about this, he'll want in.
do you trust him? - Be hard to keep him out.
I hear he's as stubborn as you are.
ALFRED: Be nice when Wayne Manor's rebuilt.
you can swap not sleeping in a penthouse...
...for not sleeping in a mansion.
whenever you stitch yourself up, you do make a bloody mess.
Yeah. It makes me learn from my mistakes.
you ought to be pretty knowledgeable by now, then.
my armor.
I'm carrying too much weight. I need to be... I need to be faster.
I'm sure Mr. Fox can oblige.
did you get mauled by a tiger? - It was a dog.
huh? - It was a big dog.
there were more copycats last night, Alfred, with guns.
why not hire them, take the weekend off?
that wasn't exactly what I had in mind...
...when I said I wanted to inspire people.
I know.
but things have improved.
look at the new district attorney.
BRUCE: I am, closely.
need to know if he can be trusted.
are you interested in his character or his social circle?
who Rachel spends her time with is her business.
I trust you don't have me followed on my day off.
if you ever took one, I might.
know your limits, Master Wayne.
Batman has no limits.
well, you do, sir. - Well, can't afford to know them.
and what's gonna happen on the day that you find out?
we all know how much you like to say "I told you so."
on that day, Master Wayne, even I won't want to.
probably.
man: Sorry I'm late, folks.
where were you? - Worried you'd have to step up?
Harvey, I know these briefs backwards. - Well, then...
...fair's fair.
heads, I'll take it. Tails, he's all yours.
yeah? You wanna flip a coin to see who leads?
my father's lucky coin. As I recall, it got me my first date with you.
I wouldn't leave something like that up to chance.
I don't. I make my own luck.
BAILIFF: All rise. The Honorable Judge Freel presiding.
I thought the DA just played golf with the mayor.
Teeoff's 1: 30. More than enough time to put you away for life, Sally.
with Carmine Falcone in Arkham...
...someone must have stepped up to run the so-called family.
is that man in this courtroom today?
could you identify him for us, please? - You win, counselor.
it was me.
I have a sworn statement from you that this man...
...Salvatore Maroni, is the new head of the Falcone crime family.
Maroni? He's a fall guy. I'm the brains of the organization.
hostile? I'll show you hostile!
carbon fiber, . 28 caliber, made in China.
if you wanna kill a public servant, Mr. Maroni...
...I recommend you buy American.
judge: Get him out of here. - But, Your Honor, I'm not done.
we'll never be able to link the gun to Maroni, so we can't charge him.
but they're trying to kill you, means we're getting to them.
I'm glad you're so pleased, Rachel. I'm fine, by the way.
but, you know...
...if you said you were rattled, we could take the rest of the day off.
can't. I dragged the head of the Major Crimes Unit down here.
Oh, Jim Gordon? He's a friend, actually. Try to be nice.
I hear you got a hell of a right cross.
it's a shame Sal's going to walk.
Yeah, well, good thing about the Mob is they keep giving you second chances.
lightly irradiated bills.
fancy stuff for a city cop. Have help?
we liaise with various agencies...
save it, Gordon. I wanna meet him.
official policy is to arrest the vigilante known as Batman on sight.
Mm-hm. What about that floodlight on the top of MCU?
if you got problems with malfunctioning equipment...
...I suggest you take them up with Maintenance, counselor.
I've put every money launderer in Gotham behind bars...
...but the Mob is still getting its money out.
I think you and your friend have found the last game in town.
you're trying to hit them where it hurts, their wallets.
it's bold.
you gonna count me in?
in this town, the fewer people know something, the safer the operation.
I don't like that you got your own special unit...
...and it's full of cops I investigated at Internal Affairs.
if I didn't work with cops you'd investigated while at IA...
...I'd be working alone.
I don't get political points for being an idealist.
I do the best I can with what I have.
you want me to back warrants for search and seizure on five banks...
...without telling me what we're after.
I can give you the names of the banks.
well, that's a start.
I'll get you your warrants, but I want your trust.
Oh, you don't have to sell me, Dent.
we all know you're Gotham's white knight.
Yeah, well, I heard they have a different name for me down at MCU.
I wouldn't know about that.
man: In China, Lau Security Investments stands for dynamic new growth.
a joint Chinese venture with Wayne Enterprises will be a powerhouse.
fox: Well, Mr. Lau...
...I speak for the rest of the board...
...and Mr. Wayne, in expressing our own excitement.
sir, I know Mr. Wayne is curious about how his trust fund gets replenished...
...but, frankly, this is embarrassing.
you worry about the diligence, Mr. Reese.
I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.
it's done.
the numbers are solid.
do them again.
wouldn't want the trust fund to run out, now, would we?
fox: Another long night?
this joint venture was your idea, and the consultants love it.
but I'm not convinced.
Lau's company has grown by 8 percent annually like clockwork.
his revenue stream must be off the books...
...maybe even illegal.
okay. Cancel the deal.
you already knew.
just needed a closer look at their books.
anything else you can trouble me for?
I need a new suit.
Yeah. Three buttons is a little '90s, Mr. Wayne.
I'm not talking fashion, Mr. Fox, so much as function.
you wanna be able to turn your head.
sure make backing out of the driveway easier.
I'll see what I can do.
took three weeks to get a reservation here.
I had to tell them I work for the government.
Really? - Health inspector's...
...not afraid to pull strings.
Rachel. Fancy that.
Yeah, Bruce. Fancy that.
Rachel, Natascha. Natascha, Rachel.
Natascha. Are you the prima...? - Prima ballerina for the Moscow Ballet.
Wow. Harvey's taking me next week. - Really? So you're into ballet?
Bruce. This is Harvey Dent.
the famous Bruce Wayne. Rachel's told me everything about you.
I certainly hope not.
let's put a couple tables together. - I'm not sure that they'll let us.
Oh, they should. I own the place.
how could you want to raise children in a city like this?
well, I was raised here. I turned out okay.
the Palisades? Sure.
you know, as our new DA, you might wanna figure out...
...where your jurisdiction ends.
I'm talking about the kind of city that idolizes a masked vigilante.
Gotham City is proud of an ordinary citizen standing up for what's right.
Gotham needs heroes like you, elected officials...
...not a man who thinks he's above the law.
who appointed the Batman?
we did. All of us who stood by and let scum take control of our city.
NATASCHA: But this is a democracy, Harvey.
dent: When their enemies were at the gates...
...the Romans would suspend democracy and appoint one man to protect the city.
it wasn't considered an honor, it was a public service.
Harvey, the last man that they appointed...
...to protect the republic was named Caesar...
...and he never gave up his power. - Okay, fine.
you either die a hero...
...or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.
whoever the Batman is, he doesn't wanna do this for the rest of his life.
NATASCHA: Someone like you, Mr. Dent?
maybe. If I'm up to it.
if I were sneaking out every night, someone would've noticed by now.
well, I'm sold, Dent, and I'm gonna throw you a fundraiser.
that's nice, but I'm not up for reelection for three years.
no, you don't understand.
one fundraiser with my pals...
...you'll never need another cent.
what the hell is this?
as you're all aware, one of our deposits was stolen.
a relatively small amount, 68 million.
who's stupid enough to steal from us?
two-bit wackjob, wears a cheap purple suit and makeup.
he's not the problem. He's a nobody.
the problem is our money being tracked by the cops.
thanks to Mr. Maroni's well-placed sources...
...we know that police have indeed identified our banks using marked bills...
...and are planning to seize your funds today.
and since the enthusiastic new D A has put all my competitors out of business...
...I'm your only option. MARONl: So, what are you proposing?
LAU: Moving all deposits to one secure location, not a bank.
where, then? - No one can know but me.
if the police were to gain leverage over one of you...
...everyone's money would be at stake.
what stop them getting to you?
I go to Hong Kong, far from Dent's jurisdiction...
...and the Chinese will not extradite one of their own.
MARONl: How soon can you move the money?
LAU: I already have.
for obvious reasons, I couldn't wait for your permission.
rest assured, your money is safe.
and I thought my jokes were bad.
give me one reason why I shouldn't have my boy pull your head off.
how about a magic trick?
I'm gonna make this pencil disappear.
it's gone.
Oh, and by the way, the suit, it wasn't cheap.
you ought to know, you bought it. CHECHEN: Sit.
I want to hear proposition.
JOKER: Let's wind the clocks back a year.
these cops and lawyers wouldn't dare cross any of you.
I mean, what happened?
you see, a guy like me...
a freak. MOBSTER 1: Damn right.
a guy like me... Look, listen.
I know why you choose to have your little, ahem...
...group-therapy sessions in broad daylight.
I know why you're afraid to go out at night.
the Batman.
see, Batman has shown Gotham your true colors, unfortunately.
dent, he's just the beginning.
and as for the television's so-called plan...
...Batman has no jurisdiction.
he'll find him and make him squeal.
I know the squealers when I see them...
...and...
CHECHEN: What do you propose?
it's simple. We, uh, kill the Batman.
if it's so simple, why haven't you done it already?
if you're good at something, never do it for free.
how much you want?
uh, half.
GAMBOL: You're crazy. - No, I'm not.
no, I'm not.
if we don't deal with this now...
· · ·soon· · ·
...little Gambol here won't be able to get a nickel for his grandma.
enough from the clown!
Ah, ta-ta-ta. Let's not blow...
mobster 2: Shit! ...this out of proportion.
you think you can steal from us and just walk away?
Yeah. GAMBOL: I'm putting the word out.
five hundred grand for this clown dead.
a million alive, so I can teach him some manners first.
all right. So, listen, why don't you give me a call...
...when you wanna start taking things a little more seriously?
here's my card.
you're a hard man to reach.
Lau's halfway to Hong Kong.
if you'd have asked, I could have taken his passport.
all that was left in the vaults were marked bills.
they knew we were coming. As soon as your office got involved...
my office?
you're sitting down there with scum like Wuertz and Ramirez and you're talking...
Oh, yeah. I almost had your rookie cold on a racketeering beat.
don't try and cloud the fact that clearly Maroni's got people in your office, Dent.
we need Lau back...
...but the Chinese won't extradite a national under any circumstances.
if I get him to you, can you get him to talk?
I'll get him to sing.
we're going after the Mob's life savings.
things will get ugly.
I knew the risk when I took this job, lieutenant.
how will you get him back, any...?
he does that.
our Chinese friends left town before I could tell them the deal was off.
well, I'm sure that you've always wanted to go to Hong Kong.
what's wrong with a phone call?
I think Mr. Lau deserves a more personal touch.
fox: Now, for high-altitude jumps...
...you're going to need oxygen and stabilizers.
well, I must say, compared to your usual requests...
...jumping out of an airplane is pretty straightforward.
BRUCE: What about getting back into the plane?
I'd recommend a good travel agent. - Without it landing.
now, that's more like it, Mr. Wayne.
the CIA had a program back in the '60s...
...for getting their people out of hot spots called Sky Hook.
we could look into that. - Yeah.
hardened Kevlar plates over titanium-dipped...
...tri-weave fibers for flexibility.
you'll be lighter, faster, more agile.
perhaps you should read the instructions first?
Yeah. - Now, there is a tradeoff.
separation of the plates makes you more vulnerable to knives and gunfire.
we wouldn't wanna make things too easy, now, would we?
how will it hold up against dogs?
we talking rottweilers or Chihuahuas?
should do fine against cats.
I found one in Arizona.
a very nice man said he could have it up and running in a week...
...and he takes cash.
what about the flight crew? - South Korean smugglers.
they run flights into Pyongyang, below radar.
did you think of an alibi? - Oh, yes.
I believe this is your plane, sir.
you look tired, Alfred. You'll be all right without me?
if you can tell me the Russian for "apply your own bloody suntan lotion.
yo, Gambol, somebody here for you. They say they've just killed the Joker.
bodyguard: They brought the body.
so, dead, that's 500.
how about alive? Hm?
you wanna know how I got these scars?
my father was...
...a drinker...
...and a fiend.
and one night, he goes off crazier than usual.
mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself.
he doesn't like that...
...not one bit.
so, me watching...
...he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it.
he turns to me and he says:
why so serious?
he comes at me with the knife.
why so serious?
he sticks the blade in my mouth.
let's put a smile on that face.
and...
why so serious?
...our operation is small...
...but there is a lot of potential...
...for aggressive expansion.
so which of you fine gentlemen would like to join our team?
Oh. There's only one spot open right now, so we're gonna have...
...tryouts.
make it fast.
man: Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr. Fox.
Mr. Lau regrets he is unable to greet you in person today.
fox: I understand.
for security purposes, I'm gonna have to ask you to check in your mobile.
of course.
I must apologize for leaving Gotham in the middle of our negotiations.
this misunderstanding with the Gotham police force...
...I couldn't let it threaten my company. - Of course.
a businessman of your stature will understand and...
...with you here now, we can continue.
we do not allow cell phones in here.
I'm sorry. Forgot I had it.
no, I really came to tell you that our business deal has to be put on hold.
you see, we can't afford to be seen to do business with...
...Whatever it is you're accused of being.
I'm sure a businessman of your stature will understand.
I think, Mr. Fox, a simple phone call might have sufficed.
Mr. Wayne didn't want you to think he was deliberately wasting your time.
just accidentally wasting it.
that's very good, Mr. Lau. "Accidentally." Very good.
Hey, sir.
there's a better view from the peak tram.
how's the view from LSI Holdings?
restricted.
lau is holed up in there good and tight.
what's this? - I had R & D work it up.
sends out a high-frequency pulse...
...records the response time for mapping an environment.
sonar. Just like a...
submarine, Mr. Wayne. Like a submarine.
and the other device? - It's in place.
Mr. Wayne?
good luck.
[Speaking IN CHINESE]
[LAU SHOUTING IN CHINESE]
RACHEL: Look, give us the money and we'll talk about making a deal.
the money is the only reason I'm still alive.
Oh, you mean, when they find out that you've helped us, they're gonna kill you?
are you threatening my client? - No.
I'm just assuming your client's cooperation with this investigation.
as will everyone.
no? Okay.
enjoy your time in County, Mr. Lau.
LAU: Wait!
I won't give you the money...
...but I will give you my clients, all of them.
you were a glorified accountant.
what could you possibly have on all of them that we could charge?
I'm good with calculation. I handled all their investments.
one big pot.
got it.
one minute.
Rico. If they pooled their money...
...we can charge them as one criminal conspiracy.
charge them with what?
in a RICO case, if you can charge one of them with a felony...
you can charge all of them with it. That's great.
Mr. Lau.
what kind of details do you have about this communal fund?
Ledgers...? - Immunity, protection...
...a chartered plane back to Hong Kong. - After you testify in open court.
I'm just curious. With all your clients locked up...
...What's gonna happen with all that money?
like I said, I'm good with calculation.
he can't go to County. I'll keep him here in the holding cells.
what is this, Gordon, your fortress?
well, you trust them over at County?
I don't trust them here.
lau stays.
well, I don 't know about Mr. Lau's travel arrangements...
...but I'm sure glad he's back.
put word out. We hire the clown.
he was right. We have to fix real problem.
Batman.
I'm not aware of any participation... - Our boy looks good on the tube.
you sure you wanna embarrass me in front of my friends?
Oh, don't worry. They're coming too.
STEPHENS: Have a nice trip. See you next fall.
woman: Seven hundred twelve counts of extortion.
eight hundred and forty-nine counts of racketeering.
two hundred and forty-six counts of fraud.
eighty-seven counts of conspiracy murder.
five hundred and twenty-seven counts of obstruction of justice.
how do the defendants plead?
order in the court.
mayor: Five hundred and forty-nine criminals at once.
how did you convince Surrillo to hear this farce?
she shares my enthusiasm for justice. After all, she is a judge.
even if you blow enough smoke to get convictions out of Surrillo...
...you're gonna set a new record at appeals.
it won't matter. The head guys make bail, sure.
but the midlevel guys, they can't.
they can't afford to be off the streets.
they'll cut deals that include some jail time.
think of all you could do with 18 months of clean streets.
LOEB: Mr. Mayor, you can't... - No, get out. Both of you.
sit down.
the public likes you. That's the only reason that this might fly.
but that means it's on you.
they're all gonna come after you now, and not just the Mob.
politicians, journalists, cops.
anyone whose wallet's about to get lighter.
are you up to it? You'd better be.
because they get anything on you...
...and those criminals are back on the streets, followed swiftly by you and me.
Jesus!
ALFRED: I think your fundraiser will be a great success, sir.
BRUCE: And why do you think I wanna hold a party for Harvey Dent?
I assumed it was your usual reason for socializing beyond myself...
...and the scum of Gotham's underbelly:
to try to impress Miss Dawes.
very droll, but very wrong. Actually, it's Dent.
engel [ON TV]: Police released video footage found concealed on the body.
sensitive viewers, be aware. The image is disturbing.
JOKER: Tell them your name.
JOKER: And are you the real Batman?
Brian: No. JOKER: No?
no. - No?
then why do you dress up like him?
Brian: Because he's a symbol that we don 't have to be afraid of scum like you.
Yeah. You do, Brian. You really do.
so you think Batman 's made Gotham a better place? Hm?
look at me.
look at me!
you see, this is how crazy Batman 's made Gotham.
you want order in Gotham...
...Batman must take off his mask and turn himself in.
Oh, and every day he doesn't, people will die.
starting tonight.
I'm a man of my word.
Harvey Dent, scourge of the underworld...
...scared stiff by the trust-fund brigade.
I'll be back. - Rachel.
a little liquid courage, Mr. Dent?
thank you. Alfred, right? - That's right, sir.
Rachel talks about you all the time. You've known her her whole life.
not yet, sir.
any psychotic ex-boyfriends I should be aware of?
Oh, you have no idea.
BRUCE: I'm sorry that I'm late.
I'm glad to see that you all got started without me.
now, where is Harvey? Where...?
Harvey Dent, the man of the hour.
Where's Rachel Dawes?
she is my oldest friend. Come here.
when Rachel first told me she was dating Harvey Dent...
...I had one thing to say:
the guy from those God-awful campaign commercials?
I believe in Harvey Dent." Yeah, nice slogan, Harvey.
but it caught Rachel's attention.
and then I started to pay attention to Harvey...
...and all that he's been doing as our new DA.
and you know what?
I believe in Harvey Dent.
I believe that on his watch, Gotham can feel...
...a little safer, a little more optimistic.
look at this face. This is the face of Gotham's bright future.
to Harvey Dent. Let's hear it for him.
Harvey may not know you well enough...
...to understand you're making fun of him...
...but I do. - No, I meant every word.
you know that day that you once told me about...
...when Gotham would no longer need Batman?
it's coming. - Bruce.
you can't ask me to wait for that. - It's happening now. Harvey is that hero.
he locked up half of the city's criminals, and he did it without wearing a mask.
Gotham needs a hero with a face.
dent: You can throw a party, Wayne, I'll give you that.
thanks again.
you mind if I borrow Rachel?
lieutenant, that joker card pinned to the body?
forensics found three sets of DNA.
any matches? - All three.
the DNA belongs to Judge Surrillo, Harvey Dent and Commissioner Loeb.
the Joker's telling us who he's targeting.
get a unit over to Surrillo's house. Tell Wuertz to find Dent.
protective custody. Where's the commissioner?
city hall. - Seal the building.
no one in or out till I get there. - Got it.
Gordon. What are you up to?
we're secure. I want a floor-by-floor search of the entire building.
we believe the Joker's made a threat against your life.
these are dangerous people.
you're not giving me a lot of information.
even we don't know where you're going.
take the envelope, get in, open it. It'll tell you where you're headed.
you can't leave me alone with these people.
the whole Mob's after you and you're worried about these guys?
compared to this, the Mob doesn't scare me.
Gordon, you're unlikely to discover this for yourself, so...
...Take my word, the police commissioner earns a lot of threats.
I found the appropriate response to these situations a long time ago.
them gunning for you makes you see things clearly.
Yeah, I bet.
Yeah. It makes you think about things you couldn't stand losing...
...about who you wanna spend your life with.
that's a pretty big commitment. - Not if the Mob has their way.
you get to explain to my wife...
...why I'm late for dinner.
sir, the joker card had traces of your DNA on it.
don't do that. - All right.
let's be serious, then. - Okay.
what's your answer?
I don't have an answer.
how'd they get my DNA?
somebody with access to your office or house...
...must have lifted a tissue or a glass... Wait! Wait!
well, I guess no answer is a no. - Harvey.
it's someone else, isn't it? - Harvey.
just tell me it's not Wayne. The guy's a complete f...
what are you doing?
GORDON: Oh, shit.
GORDON: Get a medic!
they've come for him.
we made it.
stay hidden.
good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
we are tonight's entertainment.
I only have one question:
where is Harvey Dent?
you know where Harvey is? You know who he is?
THUG: Hands up, pretty boy.
do you know where I can find Harvey? I need to talk to him.
just something little, huh? No.
what's going on out there? Wayne!
Oh, thank God, you've got a panic room.
man: Hey, wait...
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
you know, I'll settle for his loved ones.
we're not intimidated by thugs.
you know...
...you remind me of my father.
I hated my father.
RACHEL: Okay, stop.
well, hello, beautiful.
you must be Harvey's squeeze. Hm?
and you are beautiful.
you look nervous. Is it the scars?
you wanna know how I got them?
come here. Hey.
look at me.
so I had a wife. She was beautiful, like you...
...who tells me I worry too much...
...who tells me I ought to smile more...
...who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks. Hey.
one day they carve her face.
and we have no money for surgeries. She can't take it.
I just wanna see her smile again. Hm?
I just want her to know that I don't care about the scars.
so...
and you know what? She can't stand the sight of me.
she leaves.
now I see the funny side.
now I'm always smiling.
you got a little fight in you. I like that.
batman: Then you're gonna love me.
drop the gun.
Oh, sure. You just take off your little mask...
...and show us all who you really are. Hm?
let her go.
very poor choice of words.
are you all right?
let's not do that again.
is Harvey okay? - He's safe.
thank you.
Jim, it's over.
as long as they don't get to Lau, we've cut off their funds.
the prosecution's over.
nobody's standing up in front of a judge...
...while judges and police commissioners are getting blown away.
what about Dent? - He's got any sense...
...Dent's halfway to Mex...
dent: So where do you keep your trash?
you're due in court. I need you alive long enough to get you on the record.
you can't protect me. You can't even protect yourselves.
you refuse to cooperate, you're not coming back here, you go to County.
how long do you calculate you'll last in there?
targeting me won't get their money.
I knew the Mob wouldn't go down easily...
...but this is different. They crossed a line.
you crossed the line first.
you squeezed them, you hammered them to the point of desperation.
and in their desperation, they turned to a man they didn't fully understand.
criminals aren't complicated, Alfred.
we just need to figure out what he's after.
ALFRED: With respect, Master Wayne...
...perhaps this is a man you don't fully understand either.
a long time ago, I was in Burma...
...and my friends and I were working for the local government.
they were trying to buy the loyalty of tribal leaders...
...By bribing them with precious stones...
...but their caravans were being raided in a forest north of Rangoon by a bandit.
so we went looking for the stones.
but in six months, we never met anyone who traded with him.
one day, I saw a child playing with a ruby...
...the size of a tangerine.
the bandit had been throwing them away.
so why steal them? - Because he thought it was good sport.
because some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money.
they can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with.
some men just wanna watch the world burn.
woman: Your name, sir?
JOKER: Eighth and Orchard. You'll find Harvey Dent there.
batman: Check the names.
I need 10 minutes with the scene before your men contaminate it.
it's because of you these guys are dead...
detective!
give us a minute, guys.
that's brick underneath.
gonna take ballistics off a shattered bullet?
no.
fingerprints.
whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.
because we found his next target. He's put it in tomorrow's paper.
I'm not sure you made it loud enough, sir.
what can I do for you, Mr. Reese?
you wanted me to do the diligence on the LSI Holdings deal again.
well, I found some irregularities.
their CEO is in police custody.
no, not with their numbers, with yours.
applied Sciences. Whole division of Wayne Enterprises...
...just disappeared overnight.
I went down to the archives and I started pulling some old files.
don't tell me you didn't recognize your baby...
...pancaking cop cars on the evening news.
now you got the entire R&D Department burning through cash...
...claiming it's related to cell phones for the Army?
what are you building for him now, a rocket ship?
I want...
...$ 10 million a year for the rest of my life.
let me get this straight.
you think that your client...
one of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the world...
...is secretly a vigilante...
...who spends his nights beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands...
...and your plan is to blackmail this person?
good luck.
keep that.
fox: This is your original scan.
here it is reengineered.
and there's the thumbprint he left when he pushed the round in the clip.
I'll get you a copy.
Mr. Wayne, did you reassign R & D?
Yeah. Government telecommunications project.
wasn't aware we had any government contracts.
you know, Lucius, I'm playing this one pretty close to the chest.
fair enough.
ENGEL: With no word from the Batman...
...even as they mourn Commissioner Loeb...
...these cops have to wonder if the Joker will make good on his threat...
...in the obituary column of The Gotham Times to kill the mayor.
I've checked all the databases. There are four possibles.
cross-reference the addresses.
look for Parkside, overlooking the parade.
I got one.
Melvin White, 1502 Randolph Apartments.
aggravated assault, moved to Arkham twice.
what do you got on the roof?
we're tight, but frankly, there's a lot of windows up here.
commissioner Loeb dedicated his life to law enforcement...
...and to the protection of his community.
I remember when I first took office...
...and I asked if he wanted to stay on as commissioner.
and he said he would, provided I kept my politics out of his office.
clearly he was not a man who minced words, nor should he have been.
a number of policies that he enacted as commissioner were unpopular.
policies that flooded my office with angry calls and letters...
who's that? - What happened?
they took our guns.
and our uniforms.
mayor: And as we recognize the sacrifice of this man...
...we must remember that vigilance is the price of safety.
stand by. Honor guard.
attention. Port arms.
ready! Aim! Fire!
ready! Aim!
ready! Aim!
officer: Stay down! Don't move!
STEPHENS: Mr. Mayor. Get him out of here.
I'll see you later. - Why are you going back?
get out of here.
tell me what you know about the Joker.
no.
I'm sorry, Barbara.
Jimmy, go play with your sister. Go ahead, honey.
STEPHENS: If there's anything we can do, anything you need...
...we're here for you.
Shh.
Barbara: Are you out there?
are you? You brought this craziness on us. You did!
you brought this on us!
switch it off, he ain't coming. He doesn't wanna talk to us.
God help whoever he does wanna talk to.
can't we go someplace quieter? We can't hear each other talk.
what makes you think I wanna hear you talk?
what?
yeah? MAN: Second.
okay.
Harvey, where are you? DENT: Where are you?
I'm where you should be, at Major Crimes.
I'm trying to deal with all of this mess.
can I get the fingerprint analysis? - Rachel, listen. You're not safe there.
this is Gordon's unit. - Gordon 's gone.
RACHEL: He vouched for these men. - And he's gone.
the Joker's named you next.
God, is there someone, is there anyone in this town we can trust?
we can trust Bruce Wayne.
no. Rachel, I know you're his friend, but...
Harvey, trust me.
Bruce's penthouse is now the safest place in the city.
then you go straight there.
don't tell anybody and I'll find you there.
I love you.
I want the Joker.
from one professional to another...
...you're trying to scare somebody, pick a better spot.
from this height, the fall wouldn't kill me.
I'm counting on it. - Huh!
where is he? - I don't know where he is. He found us.
he must have friends.
friends? Have you met this guy?
someone knows where he is.
nobody's gonna tell you nothing.
they're wise to your act.
you got rules. The Joker, he's got no rules.
nobody's gonna cross him for you. If you want this guy, you got one way.
but you already know what that is.
just take off that mask, let him come find you.
or you can let a couple more people get killed while you make up your mind.
you wanna play games?
how's that feel?
you wouldn't. - I wouldn't!
you don't think I will? - Mm-mm.
you don't think I will? - Mm-mm.
no. No, I wouldn't.
that's why I'm not gonna leave it up to me.
heads, you get to keep your head.
tails...
...not so lucky.
so you wanna tell me about the Joker?
let's go again. - I don't know anything! God, don't!
you're not playing the odds, friend.
let's do it again.
you'd leave a man's life to chance?
not exactly. - His name's Schiff, Thomas.
he's a paranoid schizophrenic, former patient at Arkham.
the kind of mind the Joker attracts. What do you expect to learn from him?
the Joker killed Gordon. He's gonna kill Rachel.
you're the symbol of hope I could never be.
your stand against organized crime...
...is the first legitimate ray of light in Gotham in decades.
if anyone saw this, everything would be undone.
the criminals you arrested would be released...
...and Jim Gordon will have died for nothing.
you're gonna hold a press conference tomorrow.
Why? - No one else will die because of me.
Gotham's in your hands now.
you can't.
you can't give in.
you can't give in!
Harvey called.
he said Batman's gonna turn himself in.
I have no choice.
you honestly think that's gonna keep the Joker from killing people?
maybe not. But I have enough blood on my hands.
and I've seen now what I would have to become to stop men like him.
you once told me that if the day came when I was finished...
...that we'd be together.
Bruce, don't make me your one hope for a normal life.
did you mean it?
Yes.
if you turn yourself in, they're not gonna let us be together.
ALFRED: Logs as well? BRUCE: Everything.
anything that could lead back to Lucius or Rachel.
people are dying, Alfred. What would you have me do?
endure, Master Wayne. Take it.
they'll hate you for it, but that's the point of Batman.
he can be the outcast. He can make the choice that no one else can make.
the right choice.
no, today I found out what Batman can't do.
he can't endure this.
today you get to say "I told you so."
today, I don't want to.
but I did bloody tell you.
ALFRED: I suppose they're gonna lock me up as well...
...as your accomplice.
BRUCE: Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them the whole thing was your idea.
ladies and gentlemen, I've called this press conference for two reasons.
firstly, to assure the citizens of Gotham...
...that everything that can be done over the Joker killings is being done.
secondly, because the Batman has offered to turn himself in.
but let's consider the situation.
should we give in to this terrorist's demands?
do we really think he's gonna...?
you'd rather protect an outlaw vigilante than the lives of citizens?
the Batman is an outlaw.
that's not why we demand he turn himself in...
...we're doing it because we're scared.
we've been happy to let Batman clean up our streets till now.
man 1: Things are worse than ever! MAN 2: Amen.
Yes, they are.
but the night is darkest just before the dawn.
and I promise you...
...the dawn is coming.
one day, the Batman will have to answer for the laws he's broken. But to us...
...not to this madman.
no more dead cops! OFFICERS: Yeah!
he should turn himself in!
man 3: Give us the Batman! Come on! MAN 4: Where is he?
so be it. Take the Batman into custody.
woman: What? MAN 5: Is he here?
I am the Batman.
man 6: What? MAN 7: Come on.
why is he letting Harvey do this?
he went down to the press conference. - I know. He just stood by.
perhaps both Bruce and Mr. Dent...
...believe that Batman stands for something more important...
...than the whims of a terrorist, Miss Dawes...
...even if everyone hates him for it.
that's the sacrifice he's making.
he's not being a hero. He's being something more.
Yeah, you're absolutely right.
letting Harvey take the fall for this is not heroic at all.
you know him better than anyone.
I do.
will you give this to him for me? When the time is right?
how will I know?
it's not sealed.
goodbye, Alfred.
Bye, Rachel.
I didn't have time to talk this through.
what are you doing?
they're transferring me to Central Holding.
this is the Joker's chance, and when he attacks, the Batman will take him down.
listen. This is too dangerous.
we get this guy to County, he's their problem. The streets will be cleared...
...so let's go. The convoys stop for no reason.
I hope you got some moves, pal.
he's using you as bait. He doesn't know if he can get the Joker.
he's failed so far.
how do you know what he's thinking?
I just do. Anyway, this isn't just about you.
what about the people depending on you...
...to clean the city up and do it honorably and...?
Harvey. Tell everyone the truth.
heads, I go through with it.
this is your life. You can't leave...
...something like that to chance. - I'm not.
you make your own luck.
Hey, you wait like everybody else, pal.
what the hell is that?
obstruction ahead, obstruction ahead!
damn it! All units divert down onto Lower Fifth. I repeat, exit down.
exit down!
lower Fifth? We'll be like turkeys on Thanksgiving.
Jesus. Come on, get us out of here. Let's go.
listen, we need backup. We've got company.
we got trouble, guys.
lock and load!
the hell was that?
these are built for that, right? - He'll need something...
...a lot bigger to get through this.
what is that?
what is that, a bazooka?
I didn't sign up for this!
look out.
look out!
JOKER: Hmm.
come on, let's go!
where are we?
Hey, Henson, give me the map.
huh?
the map... give me the map.
Yeah, I got it. I got it.
you need help?
yeah... no, I got it. I'm fine.
I'm all right.
hang in there.
all right.
I think we passed through Winchester a week ago.
we headed south, using Route 2.
if we're averaging 20 miles a day...
right? 20 miles? You think we're doing 20 miles a day?
I don't think it's that much, with him.
well, that would put us somewhere around here then, in this shit.
what am I missing here, Rick?
look, this small ridge about five miles west of here and over those hills with the river running parallel...
rocky terrain provides protection;
the river provides a water source.
it's a perfect place for them.
Oh, yeah, we should go there then.
let's pick up the pace.
quietly.
let's go.
Rick, this is fucking bullshit.
there's no way in hell we're doing this. This is a bad idea.
what are you thinking?
what am I thinking? Okay...
those storm clouds are coming back and I'm worried about Henson getting soaked.
Hey, don't fucking bring me into this, man.
you can't even stand. - He's right.
we're cornering ourselves.
Yeah, well, this is not about us, Adam.
fuck this, Rick. - Adam, please stop.
Oh, so I don't get a say? - Enough already.
no tracks.
that's a start.
let's go, kid.
and a basement.
flashlight.
anything?
clear.
Hey.
just relax, okay?
relax.
lie down.
okay?
keep warm.
Oh, man. Do I get a bedtime story, too?
Oh, sure. Once upon a time there was an idiot called Henson.
look, I don't like this place at all.
it seems like no one has been in or around here for a long time, which is good.
so we rest, we stay dry and get the hell out as soon as the rain lets up.
inventory. Sound off.
well, I'm still at nine.
15
I am at eight and three.
Ooh, that is hot.
kid?
only six.
41 rounds total.
not too good.
how are my babies?
dude, you're getting way too creepy with those seeds.
next you'll be naming them.
I already have... Hope and Faith.
Oh, my God, you're serious, aren't you?
mock if you will, but these are our future, once we find a nice place.
Jesus Christ, Rick.
do me a favor, man. Not today.
Adam, Adam.
Hey, Adam, hold on.
so what's cooking?
this is the last of the dried rabbit that we traded for.
and we've got two more of these mystery suckers left. That's it.
guys, we need to find more food.
Hey!
do you think Susan is dead?
Susan Markunis from high school?
you still think about her?
no.
remember...
remember her and Jenny at the lake?
holy shit. Do you remember that?
of course.
Oh, man.
it feels like years ago now.
well, it was.
you think she's dead? You think Susan's dead...
all these people, all our friends?
do I think they're dead?
Yeah. I mean, is it just us now?
I fucking know they're dead.
you know, she was nice.
she had those...
Susan was a bitch to you, Rick.
everybody knew that but you.
she was a bitch.
thank you.
you know, it's weird, thinking about it.
Yeah, don't.
so, preference?
well, anything that still has a front door is always a good sign.
Hey, it's gonna be fine, just like it always is.
five minutes, no more. Watch the clock.
the safety's off. It's fully loaded.
I love you. - I love you, too.
lock the doors. I'll be right back.
two honks if you see anything.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes...
No!
No!
No!
make a wish.
I know. It's okay.
it's okay.
nice day, huh?
burning gold there. What are we celebrating?
I know.
might as well be today.
I know everybody's pretty much lost somebody...
don't.
I just need to know.
I just wait to die.
okay?
Yeah.
we shouldn't stay here.
come on, get this off me.
Hey, Henson, get some water.
Oh, shit. - Come on, man.
Thanks, man. - Are you all right?
I'm burning from the inside out.
I've had worse hangovers, though.
you ready to get the fuck out of here?
Yeah, I'm ready.
all right, here, get your shirt.
we've been here too long.
it's time to start moving again. There you go.
he's not going anywhere. You look terrible.
sorry, baby, but you do.
the skies are clearing. - You hear what I said?
he can't even barely stand up. What, are we gonna leave him here?
we're sitting ducks right now. We got to go.
Adam, stop, all right?
Jesus, if he can't walk, it won't matter if we stay or go.
Hey, I can manage. Let's go. - That's right. He can manage.
wait, not at the speed that you need to.
we stay the night.
when was the last time we had a roof over our heads anyway?
Hey.
we have a protocol, right?
right. And what's more important right now, Adam? Hope...
Oh, don't give me that bullshit.
we got to go, and we got to go right now.
there's no discussion. We stay until Henson is strong enough again.
okay, okay. - We make use of the light.
Adam and I will salvage what we can from the house.
ladies, you're on trapping duty.
fuck.
it's pointless, and you know it.
it is not pointless.
haven't even heard a fucking bird chirp in over two years.
if you got anything more to say, now's the time.
Hey, man, I've already said it, but we've always agreed it was your call.
Oh, but this isn't about that, is it?
Hello?
Yep, I'm listening.
Rick, come here.
Oh, my God.
can you at least try to pretend to look for tracks?
you know what? Now don't get me wrong, you can definitely handle yourself with that thing, but since you hooked up with us, you barely said a word.
those three guys back there... they grew up together.
that's how they've managed to stay tight through this shit.
and I've been riding with them since,
I don't know, back when there were 12 of us.
now I get it, you're into this whole lone wolf thing, yeah.
that's fine.
but maybe it would help overall morale if you just interjected yourself just once in a while, said something... anything.
I mean, what is going on?
we're a family.
either be part of it or don't.
do you understand?
that's what I thought.
what the fuck is this?
hope and Faith, buddy.
Henson, you got to come take a look at this.
Really?
a dirty-ass basement?
I hate fucking surprises, man.
don't fucking surprise me with bullshit.
Oh, you don't like surprises? - What you got, man?
all right, surprise.
Oh.
look at that shit. - Fuck me, man.
we got food? Oh, we got food, man.
lots of food. Look at this... corned beef. We got sardines.
tuna fish. What do you like? What do you like?
I like it all, man. Oh, I like it all.
let's do it.
Oh, shit.
are you all right, man? - Yeah.
are you strong enough to carry this upstairs?
whatever I carry, I eat.
that's the spirit.
plenty to go around.
four cans of tuna.
I'm gonna bite a hole in one of these cans in a minute.
seven cans of tuna, okay.
fuck this. I'm hungry. I'm not waiting.
Oh, yeah. I'm not waiting. - Boys, I got to tell you,
I think staying here was the right call.
what's this?
rocks? Who the fuck would put rocks in here?
Rick!
no. No!
Hey! Oh, shit.
No!
what the fuck is that?
Henson! Henson!
what happened?
what the fuck is that ringing?
are there more?
there will be.
I got you.
I got you. It's okay. It's okay. - We're fucked, Adam!
Henson! Henson, I need you. Henson!
we're locked in. Adam, we're locked in.
fuck. Okay. You're okay.
Henson! Henson!
Henson, hey!
Oh, fuck. He's bleeding everywhere.
I can't stop the bleeding.
fuck.
it's okay. It's okay. Fuck, man.
they fucking got him. Shit.
he's... he's gone. - Oh, no.
Rick! Adam!
guys!
help! Help! Let us out of here!
get us the fuck out! - What the fuck is this?
guys, can you hear me? - We're fucked.
guys?
what? I can't hear you. Is Rick okay?
no, he's not okay. He's dead. We need you to get us out of here.
Shannon, help!
fuck.
fuck. No.
Adam, get over here. I need the light.
fuck! Fuck. - Get over here, Adam.
no.
shit!
Hey. Hey, Shannon.
Shannon. - Huh?
is there a mechanism or a lever that might open the door?
I can't find anything. There's nothing here.
you've got to hurry, Adam.
that ringing is gonna fucking bring them.
Shannon, Shannon, you got to go, okay?
you got to go right now.
I'm not gonna leave you here. Fuck.
we can't be here when they come.
fuck you.
go save your own fucking skin.
they're my family.
I'll kill every last one of them myself. I don't give a shit.
no, you'll die quickly.
I'm not scared of them. I'm not scared of them.
let's assume there are a dozen more of these places spread all over this countryside.
the bell is a signal.
they'll have an efficient way of checking their traps.
Oh, God, scouts.
right.
we can handle this.
it's up to them, okay?
okay. Okay.
what if they can't do it?
they will.
fuckers.
wait for it.
Hello, meat. - No, fuck you.
how is it going, fucker?
relax. - Fuck you. You relax.
why don't you get a hot one in your head right now?
I'm not even sure you have bullets.
we got something cooking for your ass.
come down here so I can bust your fucking ass.
come down here, all of you. Come down!
kitchen clear.
fuck you. Come join the party, bitch. - Upstairs clear.
keep it down, man. - I got it, man.
do you have the date? - Fuck you.
give me your friend.
Hey, fuck you. Fuck you!
just give me your friend.
we can catch you guys another time.
look, I got another offer for you, asshole, okay?
why don't you guys walk out of here and settle for each other's dicks tonight?
that's what you do. - You're all the same, you know.
you all think you're different.
you're not.
you're just dying faster than we are.
fuck you. Shut up. Fine.
have it your way. We got supplies.
we can wait for days, or hours, by the look of you.
no, fuck waiting. Come down here.
come down. I'll bust your fucking ass.
I'm gonna shoot one of these motherfuckers, man.
come on. Are you running, bitch?
fucking running, huh?
Shannon! Shannon, what's going on up there?
what the fuck is going on?
get her!
Hey! Hey!
you're certainly a pretty piece.
I see.
I see you.
you think you can use our place...
our place...
to trap all this meat and not share?
shut up. Shut up.
greedy, greedy.
there's enough to go around, you know.
we'll be back soon...
to take what's ours.
so stupid.
are you okay? - Rifle, now.
you guys all right?
daddy, Daddy.
tell you what.
let's go get the others, huh?
Yeah.
come on, get on.
you're getting big.
everybody, gather up.
we need to talk.
fuck it.
smoke her and let's get out of here. There's got to be more of them coming.
no, no, no, just wait. Wait a minute.
who the fuck are you, huh?
huh?
I know who she is.
you're one of them. Isn't that right?
this whole fucking time.
is it true? Are you one of them?
Yes.
let her say it. Hold on.
is that fucking right?
Henson, we don't have time for this shit.
she's one of them and I'll prove it to you.
just shoot her if she tries anything.
where is it? Huh?
there it is.
is that your mark?
Oh, fuck. Oh, this fucking bitch.
so allies to her clan won't touch her.
but cleverly hidden, isn't it?
so you can infiltrate people like us.
you piece of shit.
did you bring us here on purpose?
did you fucking bring us into this trap?
fuck yeah, she did. - This is bullshit.
bided her fucking time, too. Didn't you?
that's for Rick, you cunt.
I can't believe this shit. I don't fucking believe it.
why did she kill all those others, huh?
if she's one of them, why would she do that?
maybe it's what that sick fuck said...
she wanted us for herself. I don't know.
I don't think there's any common loyalty between those fucks.
if they aren't in her clan, they're fucking hamburger meat just the same.
am I right, sweetheart? You can jump in anytime.
well, why didn't she kill us fucking weeks ago, huh?
don't you think she would have did that?
I don't fucking know, Henson.
just fucking kill her and let's get out of here.
you helped us. Why?
huh? Fucking why?
well, say something.
okay.
you fucking say something.
anything.
Adam. Adam, just finish her off already.
Adam. Adam!
come on.
no.
just finish her.
not so quickly. No mercy for her.
no mercy.
God damn it, Adam, please, let's go, man.
we have time for this.
no, we don't have time... - We have time for this!
we have time for this!
no, we fucking don't have time!
let's get the fuck out of here. Come on.
I've seen how you operate.
you don't kill quickly.
you make your prey walk back to the camp so you can process them properly.
it's easier.
it's cleaner. It's more efficient.
is that what you did to my wife and daughter?
did you make them walk?
come on, Adam, let's get out of here.
Hey, go ahead if you want.
it's already too fucking late. They're already on their way.
there's nothing around here for miles.
they'll track us down in less than a day. You're already dead.
we all are.
so, with what little time I have left,
I want to spend with you.
okay?
how did you kill them, huh?
was it like it used to be with cows, just like a quick blow to the head?
or...
did you... did you torture them?
did you... did you cut my little baby up?
did you cut her up before you cooked her?
is that what you did?
I... I didn't kill your family.
but you're part of them.
so you're responsible.
it means you chose to be like them.
you chose to do it.
I... I chose to live.
no.
you chose to murder.
come on, God damn it, Adam. That's enough.
no.
no, please.
no.
when my baby...
...was first eating soft food...
she used to love this.
Adam, what are you doing, man? Come on.
open up for the airplane. Come on.
open up. Open up. Open up for the airplane.
open your fucking mouth!
no?
Adam, just get on with it.
shit.
I guess we're gonna have to find something a little more appetizing, huh?
have you ever wondered what your heart looks like?
Yes!
Yes, Yes, yes!
Yes, fucking kill me!
kill me, please!
please.
please just... just cut me up and leave me to rot, please.
please.
I know what I am.
and I fucking deserve it. I fucking do.
you're goddamn right! You're goddamn right, you do.
then just do it!
she was just... she was just six.
she was just six. She was so fucking little.
today was her birthday.
Adam, I didn't kill your daughter.
you all did.
you all killed her.
and I'm gonna make you pay.
I'm gonna make you pay for everybody.
I was trying to survive.
what the hell are you doing?
Yeah, man.
what are you doing, Adam, huh?
what are you fucking doing, man?
this is justice.
is that what this is?
huh?
put the knife down, brother, and back away from her.
put it down.
put it down.
so you're on her side now?
no.
I love you, man, but I'm not gonna sit here and let you butcher her like that.
that's the difference between them and us.
but if you want to kill her, let's get it over with.
we got to get the fuck out of here.
God damn you all.
I didn't lead you here.
I don't care.
I didn't miss.
I didn't miss.
don't. - Adam.
say it, Adam. - Don't.
don't you fucking dare.
say the fucking word. Say it.
I had a little sister, 12 years old.
she fell and broke her leg, bad.
twisted bone sticking out, too fragmented to just reset.
she would slow us down and die of infection in a week.
maybe they couldn't heal her.
but she was one of our own.
they strung her up...
and slit her throat.
they drank and bottled her blood as it poured out of her.
they cooked and ate her major organs that night.
three nights later I stabbed them all to death in their sleep.
look, it doesn't change what I once was.
I know that.
if you want to take me out in that field and put a bullet in my head, I won't resist.
I promise.
but he's right.
they are coming.
and you won't last two days in the open country if they're tracking you.
you either have to split up and run or you make a stand here.
what makes you think we'll last here?
you probably won't, but you have a better chance.
you have fortification and you know they're on their way.
and...
you have me.
what the fuck are you gonna do?
what the fuck do you think I want to do, hmm?
I want to kill them all.
you want to bandage that up with something?
it won't matter.
won't this piss them off even more?
at least they'll know who they're fucking with.
we're all gonna die, you know.
and frankly, I think it's too easy for you.
maybe you can prove me wrong.
you're missed, old friend.
if we weren't sure before, they'll certainly be coming now.
it's better that than to have them dig him up and make a meal.
don't you pretend like he meant anything to you.
he was a good leader.
this world has existed for over 10 years now.
there was enough shit and blood, starvation and death in that first year to fill a hundred lifetimes.
nine friends have died before us, died protecting us, and now we're all that's left.
it would be a fucking insult to them if we lied down like dogs and let these fucking animals take us so easily.
I hope they send 100 of those sick fucks.
means more for us to kill and less of them left in this world.
so tonight I'm fighting for you and you, 'cause you're my family now.
and I fear for all the soulless pieces of shit that try to get into this house tonight.
I don't know why we're trusting her.
she's not lying about wanting to kill the ones coming for us, whatever her reasons may be.
and, shit, we need the muscle.
doesn't mean I have to like it.
she ain't gonna survive the night one way or another.
are you with me?
Yeah.
great speech, buddy.
it even trumps the one you gave at Gilford our senior year in the semifinals.
if I remember, we lost to Gilford.
it's getting late. We need to get ready.
don't worry.
they're gonna pay for what they've done.
and then we'll eat.
look to this day, where yesterday has been a dream and tomorrow only a vision, and every tomorrow a vision of hope.
we know there is at least one gun.
find out what else we're up against.
go.
you look, you listen, and then you learn.
and one day you will lead.
go now.
your brother is gonna be very strong one day.
but you, my darling, are gonna be so much stronger.
what have we got?
hard to see. More than 20.
fuck.
we're in for one hell of a night, y'all.
save your bullets as a last resort.
this is our last resort.
locked and loaded. Let the countdown begin.
Hey, take these. I don't believe in redemption for someone like you, but if you...
fuck.
ready? - I'm ready.
save those fucking bullets, man.
bring me their heads.
now!
there's more coming at us. Come on.
come on, you fuckers.
they don't know who they're fucking with.
they're in for a treat now. - Make 'em count, every one.
come on. Come on and get some, bitch, come on.
get some, come on. Five bullets down, two dead.
God damn it, Adam, your window!
I got four that ain't us, Adam. They're heading your way, man.
got them coming around the back.
Henson!
Henson!
Adam.
God damn it.
get him some water. Get him some water.
are you okay? Are you all right?
hurry up. - Feels like I ran back-to-back marathons up a hill with pneumonia with these fucking freaks chasing me, man.
get some rest. Get some rest.
what's the count at?
I just got three. God damn it.
I got six in the pistol, four in the rifle.
I'm still at three. - Mary.
Mary. - Five.
five. All right. I'm gonna cover for your lazy ass, all right?
cover for mine.
you, you and you...
you have to find your way inside.
we're not going anywhere.
I need someone to get up there quietly and find out how many there really are.
knock on the front door, go through the goddamn window...
I don't care. Do it now and do it fast.
go.
they're gonna come again, harder and in full force.
no shit, genius.
what the fuck are you looking at, huh?
don't you fucking look at me.
don't you ever fucking look at me again, you hear me?
don't you fucking look at me fucking ever!
Shannon, cover the window.
you fucking hear me?
I wasn't fucking talking to you.
fuck you. - Shannon, come on.
we got a bigger fight. Stop.
I say we send her out there to hold them over while we fucking get the fuck out of here.
what the fuck is wrong with you guys?
Shannon, stop, God damn it. - Fuck!
no. No!
Shannon, what did you do?
the roof. The roof.
come on.
fuck off.
my boy.
my boy.
Hey, that was my idea.
you gonna have all the fun?
Hey, hey.
fuck, man. - You're okay. You're okay.
I only have one bullet, man.
are you okay? Are you all right, man?
just breathe. We got them. We got them good.
get out of here, man.
go. Get the fuck out, go.
Hey.
Mary, cover the front.
and that's zero, motherfucker.
Shannon.
Henson!
Henson, help me!
Argh! No!
come on, Shannon, go. Come on.
come on. - Come on, Henson.
come on, go. Get in the house. - Come on.
get in the house. Come on, go. I ain't coming.
come on, come on.
I'll take care of these motherfuckers.
come on, come get some.
cause you picked a wrong motherfucker.
come on. Four.
three.
where are you at, bitch? Two.
one.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, you'll never knock me down, man.
and I hope I make all of y'all sick, motherfucker.
here, take it. Cover the kitchen.
Where's Henson?
what?
no. No.
fuck.
what the fuck?
are we just gonna stay in here forever?
they eat their own, don't they?
I mean, shit, we killed enough of them to feed them for a month.
why the hell are they still after us?
they're still human.
what's more human than revenge?
so now this is my fault?
this is about the boy?
do it now!
fuck.
stay back.
well, it's about time.
I figured they would have done that earlier, save themselves trouble.
they weren't gonna destroy the house if they didn't have to.
all right, what the fuck are we gonna do?
well, we're not gonna stay in here and burn.
we got seven coming up the front.
how many shots in that rifle? - Just one.
use it.
no, save it.
Mary, what are you doing?
I'm stalling them while you two run out the back.
I need to do this.
do you think this changes anything?
no.
no.
I'm just tired of waiting.
come on, Adam, let's get the fuck out of here.
whoa. Take it easy.
are you sure you got enough bullets in that thing for all of us?
the ones inside are mine.
I brought them here. I trapped them.
they're my kill.
Oh?
your kill?
so you're not with them, huh?
Yeah, I don't know why I didn't see it before.
there's a look that people get when they're seeing something they've never seen before. You... you don't have that look.
so you should know that this is an invitation-only party.
this is our land, our kill.
and now you...
you belong to us, too.
my boy.
for your head.
you know, and if you're gonna do it, do it.
shoot me. Go ahead, do it.
either way you're gonna be the prize pig at my camp tonight.
Oh.
you fuckers.
fuck!
Adam.
I can't leave her.
just forget her and let's go.
she's dead.
why would you do that?
the plan, Adam...
making sure she doesn't survive the night.
or are you forgetting she's one of them?
she's not one of them. - Yes, she is.
she's not one of them. - What are you doing?
just go.
just go!
pretty.
you're mine. You're mine.
No!
I am now gonna taste your raw, sweet pain, bitch. You hear me?
come on, come on, come on.
come on, look at me. Look at me.
die, you fucks.
come on. Okay.
come on. Come on.
where the fuck are you, little son of a...?
your wife and daughter...
what were their names?
Nikki and Ava.
she was such a happy kid.
nothing ever got to her, even in this.
that's because she was loved every second she was alive.
she had her family.
I couldn't protect them.
what matters is you did for as long as you could.
you loved them enough to try.
why did you come back?
nothing's changed in so long.
I know who is waiting for me.
maybe I was just looking for a sign, something to make them proud of me again.
maybe that was you.
maybe I was just tired of being the victim.
it was the right thing to do.
Oh, my God.
it's so peaceful.
Yeah.
Yeah.
you have the chance to learn to live again.
until I was in a coma for six years, and then I woke up and found my fiancee married to another man...
and they're raising my son.
everything has changed...
including me.
one touch, and I can see things, things that happened, things that will happen.
you should see what I see.
[Bruce]: This thing's too big.
[Johnny]: You think?
all right...
so...
what do you think?
we should, uh...
cut a few feet off the bottom?
or cut a hole in the roof.
look, you just stick to christmas dinner, and let me handle the ambiance.
all right?
I need some egg nog.
sounds good.
what the hell is that?
Ah!
I knew you were wondering.
that, my man...
is a turducken.
turducken?
is that one of those chicken-inside-a-duck- inside-a-turkey things?
that's the one.
it's kind of freaky-looking, man.
it's kind of like a...
Colonel sanders meets Frankenstein type thing.
come on, man. It's frozen solid.
so?
so it's almost noon.
the thing won't be thawed until new year's, man.
[Doorbell rings] We'll run some hot water on it.
worst case scenario, I'll break out the blow torch and we'll fire that sucker up from the inside out.
delicious.
merry christmas.
what are you doing here?
come on in.
so...
is everything all right?
I had a vision.
a vision?
I was just sitting at home, and suddenly I saw it, clear as day.
it was me, and I was spending another Christmas by myself, but then I thought to myself, "who else do you know who might be on his own this time of year?
and you thought of me.
who else might want to hide away, watch bad kung fu movies, and drink this outrageously expensive bottle of french wine?
Oh, my god.
Oh, god.
you have plans, don't you?
this is so embarrassing.
no, I don't have any plans.
I don't have any plans.
I don't.
Johnny, I cannot cook an entire Christmas dinner for five people with no pots and...
my bad.
no plans, huh?
uh, Bruce Lewis. This is Alex Sinclair.
the lady psychic.
in the flesh.
I should get back to my birds.
are you staying for dinner?
Oh, no...
Absolutely.
I'll set another place.
Yeah.
sounds like you're having a party.
no, just...
you know, just a few friends.
I can't believe you're here.
you look so beautiful.
[Man]: Step away from the girl.
I said, step away from the girl.
is this me or you?
me. Definitely me.
I warned you.
now you're going to get what you deserve.
what the hell was that?
I have no idea.
it's not so much Christmas that bothers me, but what it represents.
you know, the stress and turmoil, the anxiety-induced shopping frenzy.
I mean, god forbid we shoot for a little peace on earth, goodwill towards men.
you're right.
I think we'd all be a lot better off if we just forgot about all the commercialism and looked for a little more inner peace.
Yeah.
damn. I got to go.
go where?
the toy store.
if I don't get that new hot video game, my son's going to be devastated.
but what happened to forgetting commercialism and searching for inner peace?
what are you, crazy?
we're talking about Christmas in America.
the next thing, you'll be telling me there's no such thing as Santa Claus.
you mean the fictional character created by New York City merchants at the turn of the century to encourage people to buy material goods?
I can't hear this.
sorry.
sorry.
I don't mean to sound cynical.
it's just that I experience my visions through people's emotions, and let's face it, around christmas, a lot of us are feeling pretty lousy.
on that happy note...
are you sure it's a good idea to go out there?
I mean, considering what we just saw...
Alex, you said it yourself...
your visions are metaphorical.
now, I've been naughty, but not bad enough to catch a bullet from santa in the chest.
you know what I mean?
I've got to get that game.
okay, okay, but I'm coming with you.
okay.
why do you think santa would be carrying a. 38 revolver?
I don't know.
maybe he's from a bad part of the North Pole.
whatever it means, I'm sure it's not a bad thing.
how can you be so sure?
because you're here, and that has to be a good thing.
Oh, look. There it is.
looks like you're not the only one doing last-minute shopping.
Oh...
excuse me, is this the lineup to buy the new ratchet: Deadlocked game?
no, it's the line to see who spends the night with Angelina Jolie.
nice.
good luck with that.
I guess we're waiting. Mm-hmm.
can I have your attention?
the toy box regrets to inform you that we are completely sold out of the ratchet: Deadlocked video game.
thank you.
have a very merry Christmas.
[Woman]: This is the third store I've tried today.
I know one more place, but we'd better hurry.
quick, give me a dollar. What?
you don't want to disappoint your son, do you?
excuse me!
Hi. I'm sorry.
I think you might have dropped something.
no, I don't...
Oh, yes. Thank you.
you're lucky.
that's the last one in stock.
she just took my buck.
forget it. We need to go. Do you know where big pete's is?
I thought you hated last-minute shopping.
I do, but who can resist taking down a couple of dishonest soccer moms?
this is the place.
I don't see them anywhere.
better hurry.
I'm making a list. Everybody's on it.
especially you.
merry Christmas.
how are you doing?
do you have the new ratchet: Deadlocked game?
sorry.
are you sure?
there might be one in the back.
let me check.
great. Thanks.
Hey, wait! Help!
help!
somebody, help!
let go. Let go of me!
it's your lucky day.
last one.
Oh, great.
those kids out front, they're mugging Santa.
uh, can you hold this for me?
no.
store policy.
first come, first served.
dude...
excuse me.
damn it.
stay away from me!
help!
Hey, hey... help!
somebody, help!
sir, are you okay?
they took my bag.
okay, okay.
we're going to get you some help.
they stole his bag. I got it.
[Alex]: There you go.
just take it easy.
those little rats.
if I was 10 years younger, I would've wiped the sidewalk with 'em.
I'm sure you would have.
don't patronize me, missy.
is that any way for santa to talk?
Santa?
what the hell do you...
sir, what's your name?
I don't remember.
they got away.
is he all right?
he's having a little trouble remembering things.
sir, can you tell us your name?
that's one of the things he's having trouble with.
they took my bag.
I think these fell out when they took off.
I remember who i am now.
I'm Santa.
Johnny's new girlfriend?
that's a good question, J.J.
well, I think it's great that he has somebody to share the holidays with.
Oh, yeah?
well, what are we? Chopped liver?
and besides, isn't he supposed to trim his own tree?
are you kidding?
trimming the tree is the best part of Christmas.
not better than presents.
[Walt]: Or turkey sandwiches.
or pumpkin pie.
or turkey sandwiches. Or...
okay, I get it.
I'll do it myself.
Hey, taste this.
Mm. Too much salt.
I knew it.
where the heck have you been?
we took a little detour.
Alex, you know walt.
Hey, Alex. Good to see you.
Hi.
and this is Sarah, his wife, and our son, J. J.
hello.
nice to meet you.
are you Johnny's new girlfriend?
is she?
it's...
it's kind of hard to say.
Yeah, well, Alex and I... she, uh...
where did he go? Where did he go?
who?
stay close to us, will you?
please.
I was checking out the chimney.
looks like a slam dunk. Mm-hmm.
everybody, this is our new friend that we call...
we call "Santa."
are you serious?
so who are you?
Betty Crocker?
[Instrumental version of "hark! The herald angels sing" playing]
do you have any, uh...
egg nog?
non-alcoholic.
Oh. Pass.
if you're really Santa, where's your red suit?
Oh, I just wear the suit when I'm workin'.
these are my street clothes.
don't believe me?
ask me a question.
what do I want for Christmas?
well, let's see...
baseball mitt? New bike?
Nah.
you want ratchet: Deadlocked.
pass the peanut butter, would you, peewee?
after they stole his bag, I chased them into a store, but they got away out the back door.
he says he can't remember anything before that.
[Bruce]: And you brought him here because...
because it's Christmas eve.
what was I supposed to do with him?
I think he's kind of cute.
so there are no missing persons reports matching our guy's description.
you said he's got a history of violent behavior?
well, in the vision, I saw him being chased by the cops.
that would do it.
I'll try and get his prints off of a glass.
if he's got a record, we should know who he is in a couple of hours.
if this old dude was in trouble with the law, do you really want him spending christmas in your house?
that's a good point.
maybe if we find his bag, we'll get some more clues about who he really is.
it might be worth taking him back to the spot where we found him.
how's dinner coming?
the turducken is officially thawed.
the what?
the...
I'll let him explain it.
I got to check on my yams.
turducken?
what the hell's turducken?
does any of this seem familiar to you?
Yeah, this is where the three brats got away with my stuff.
maybe if we check out the pawnshop.
Hi.
remember me?
you're the guy that was chasin' those three kids.
that's right.
listen, I was wondering, have you seen them before?
maybe hanging around outside, or...
uh, not that I recall.
mind if we look around for a while?
okay.
I'd like it even better if you bought something.
[Quietly]: He's lying.
I know. Why?
I don't know.
those are my puka shells.
sorry, pal, but you're mistaken.
I'm not your pal, and I know my stuff when I see it.
all right, big kids, what's going on over there?
this shyster's tryin' to fence my puka shell necklace.
I'm telling you, this old rummy's out of his mind.
who are you callin' a rummy?
all right, break it up, break it up.
hold on a second here.
can I see the necklace?
I don't have to show you anything.
maybe we should call the sheriff and let him sort this out, hmm?
all right, all right, hold your water.
you can look at them, but not him.
what are you doin' here?
shut up!
you take these photos?
you know I did. What's your problem?
I paid you to find her!
find her!
she's in love with somebody else.
who?
me.
how much for the shells?
20 bucks.
10 bucks.
you should be ashamed of yourself.
if I was a few years younger...
I'd wipe that grin right off your face the hard way.
he's not kidding.
not kidding.
huh.
so, seems like our santa has a bit of a mean streak.
I'm beginning to think bruce might be right.
I mean, maybe it's too dangerous letting this guy run around free.
well, the necklace was his.
besides, aren't you the least bit curious about all this?
you know what curiosity did to the cat.
we could just touch him.
that, we could do.
did you get anything?
nothing. You?
no.
maybe it's his memory loss.
could be.
these are real good. Want some?
no. No.
Santa, quick question...
do you think you'd recognize these kids that stole your bag if you saw them again?
I guess.
okay, let's go.
what are we looking for?
I told you.
we're looking for the kids that stole your bag.
Oh, right. I forgot.
I don't know if this is going to work.
what other choice do we have?
there.
that kid throwing rocks.
look, you go this way, I'm going to go that way.
what do you want me to do?
nothing! Nothing!
I'm not an invalid, you know!
gotcha!
put me down!
stop squirming, or I'll give you a timeout.
look, we just want to talk, okay?
Aah!
okay, look at me.
now, you can talk to us, or you can talk to the police.
the choice is yours.
my brothers'll kill me.
nobody's going to kill you.
Hey, that's my watch.
what are you all lookin' at me for?
he acts like he hasn't eaten in a week.
you might be right.
[Johnny]: His name is Michael O'leary.
the other two are his brothers.
Alex got him to tell us where they live, so we'll go back and check it out.
I'll go with you.
actually, walt, I was hoping you'd babysit Santa.
if what I'm seeing is true, I don't think we should leave him alone with Sarah and J.J. you know?
no problem.
what's wrong with your watch?
I must have broken it when I grabbed the kid.
I loved this watch.
Where's your allspice?
all what?
it's like trying to cook with one hand tied behind your back.
dinner's gonna be delayed.
how delayed?
I'll get back to you.
keep an eye on him, too.
Yeah, right.
come on.
somebody's here.
the brothers?
somebody else.
my boys are so alone.
help them.
please.
what can I do?
I'm begging you.
they're in danger.
they need someone to watch over them.
please. You're hurting me.
you have to help them.
let go!
what is it?
what did you see?
we have to find those boys.
we have to find them now.
hard to believe somebody lived here.
the boys must have broken in so they'd have a warm place to sleep.
it looks like they've been burning the furniture.
what about their parents?
that must have been the mother I saw on the porch.
I'm afraid she's dead.
look at this.
I don't want to do this.
you want to eat, don't you?
we do this, we got enough money to go find dad.
nice bikes, guys.
don't worry.
I've got it under control.
excellent. Thank you.
merry Christmas, losers.
what do you punks want?
we want to sell you something.
[Dealer]: What?
this.
Where'd you get it?
never mind.
you want it or not?
does it work?
you're gonna be okay.
you're gonna be okay!
what are we going to do?
there's still time.
here you go.
nice bikes, guys.
I don't want to do this.
you want to eat, don't you?
we do this, we got enough money to go find dad.
don't worry.
I've got it under control.
excellent. Thank you.
merry Christmas, losers.
what do you punks want?
Freeze! Hands on the car!
this belong to you, little man?
I never saw that before in my life.
Yeah, right, t, t, t, and m dirty harry.
Hey. You must be Mitchell.
[Alex]: And Matthew?
you boys forget something?
it wasn't our gun.
we found it in a bag. What bag?
it belonged to some old dude.
he looked like... Santa Claus. Yeah.
you guys are lucky you never fired this thing.
what do you mean?
the barrel's been blocked.
you try to shoot live ammo out of that thing, and the whole thing would blow up in your hand, or what was left of your hand.
go! Hey!
go, Matty! Go!
you'll never catch my brother!
Never!
okay, calm down. Calm down.
we just want to help you.
we just want to help you.
everything's going to be okay you guys live all by yourselves?
no mom or dad?
do you have the new ratchet: Deadlocked game?
no, but my dad's gonna get it for me.
cool.
you look beat.
I am.
Sarah, I'm sorry Christmas got so messed up.
but look at this...
a female psychic, a Santa Claus with amnesia, and the cast of oliver!
not exactly a norman rockwell painting.
when I was a kid, my mom always did Christmas.
she would start planning the day after Thanksgiving, and by Christmas Eve, she was this puddle of tears.
I guess the expectations always exceeded the reality of it...
but you know what?
it was always okay, because we were all together.
why didn't I marry you?
Oh, right, I was in a coma.
right.
I know it's here somewhere.
he's been like this for the better part of an hour.
any word on the older brother?
nothing yet.
so where's the iron chef?
Yeah, right.
he went to the store.
here. Stir this, man.
my arm's about to fall off.
so any news about our new friends, Walt?
yes and no.
Santa's still a John doe.
the boys?
Alex was right.
their mother died of breast cancer four months ago.
what about the father?
the neighbors never saw him.
those kids have been alone all this time?
apparently.
I've got an unmarked over at the house, in case the other one comes back.
Walt, do me a favor.
give me, like, 20 minutes, and then tell your officer to pull out and use his siren.
what's up? You got an idea?
maybe. Here.
Hey.
I figured you'd come back.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
I just want to talk.
where are my brothers?
they're safe, Matthew.
juvie?
no, no.
they're at my house.
look, buddy, I know about your mother.
Hey.
I'm really sorry.
what do you want?
Where's your father, Matthew?
I'm just trying to help you and your brothers.
mom and dad were gonna get divorced.
one night, she woke us up and told us to stuff all our clothes into garbage bags.
she said we were leaving, that dad didn't want us anymore.
we didn't even get to say goodbye.
after mom died, they were going to split us up, so we took off.
all we had was this picture of my dad.
what do you say we go give santa his bag back, huh, bud?
come on.
Hey, you ever had turducken?
you know what it is?
it's, like, they put a turkey inside a big...
[Woman on tv]: Don't sit there and lie to me.
you never loved me.
[Man]: Everything I did I did for you.
if only I could believe you.
[Santa, in unison with tv]: Look at me.
look into my eyes.
are these the eyes of someone lying to you?
I've done a lot of bad things in my life, but not this.
things are going to be different now.
don't you see that?
I love you.
I love you more than I've loved anyone.
we can't go on pretending that none of this has happened.
why not?
who cares what the rest of the world thinks?
it's just us now.
just you and me.
[Whispering]: Oh, my god.
what are you, like, a millionaire or something?
not exactly.
where are my...
Hey! We were worried about you!
you guys know each other?
come on.
I've got to show you something.
thank god you're back.
you have to see this. What?
why can't we just keep on driving and never look back?
there's nothing back there for us now.
we can't run for the rest of our lives.
why not?
as long as we're together.
so he memorized an old movie.
I mean, how does that help us?
look closer.
I never knew it could be like this.
but for how long?
for how long?
so he memorized a really bad old movie.
look again...
at the man on screen.
[Johnny]: It's him.
why didn't you tell us you were an actor?
I didn't remember until now.
Johnny, I'd like you to meet star of stage and screen.
I looked him up online.
that explains why you were doing the things you were doing...
they were movie parts?
and the stuff in the bag...
I remember now.
I was going to be Santa and pass out some of my movie memorabilia to a retirement home around the corner.
I felt a little dizzy, and, uh...
I guess I must have hit my head, because the next thing I remember, I was fighting with those kids on the sidewalk.
hmm.
and cut!
that's a print!
beautiful.
check the gate.
if it's good, we're moving on.
outstanding.
absolutely outstanding.
I feel so foolish.
all the trouble I've caused you...
I wish there was some way I could make it up to you.
now that you mention it...
[instrumental version of "jingle bells" playing]
what are we waiting for?
ho, ho, ho!
merry Christmas!
I was just going to take off in my magic sleigh when I got an urgent call from the north pole.
apparently, there was a house I missed, so I tapped randolph on the rear end...
forget it.
he's on a roll. Leave him alone.
I tapped him on the rear end, and we high-tailed it back here at the speed of sound.
I think he's cute.
me too.
you guys have had far too much egg nog.
[Hughes]: Let's say we look in and see what's in my treasure sack.
are the O'leary brothers here?
Michael, Matthew, and Mitchell?
for us?
well, you're the O'leary brothers, aren't you?
where did these presents come from?
[Whispering]: They're J. J.'s.
when he found out the boys weren't getting any presents, he said to put their names on a few his own.
that's quite a kid we got there.
Mm-hmm.
and is there a J. J. Bannerman here?
right here.
merry Christmas, J. J.
ratchet: Deadlocked.
exactly what I wanted.
cool!
was that from you?
not me.
was it from you?
well, there are some benefits to being psychic.
did you have that the whole time, or did you get it when you got here?
I'll never tell.
hmm.
maybe this will make it even.
what?
what did you do?
go ahead, open it.
how did you find time to get this?
I'll never tell.
thank you.
you're welcome.
dinner's served.
it's about time.
let's go with this turducken thing.
come on.
bring your presents.
do me a favor, buddy, okay?
go answer the door.
but it didn't ring.
cool.
this is amazing.
Yeah, who let Martha Stewart in here?
it looks like something out of a magazine.
[Johnny]: Gene, what a nice surprise.
I thought you had to perform a service tonight.
well, I was going to, and then I ran into someone who was looking for the O'leary brothers.
do you happen to know where I could find them?
as a matter fact, I do.
Ah.
boys...
there's someone here I think you might like to meet.
Hello, boys.
dad...
dad!
we've been looking for you.
how?
well, once we knew it was a custody battle, it wasn't hard for walal to locate the dad, and then gene was kind enough to offer us the faith heritage helicopter to fly him down here.
so are you hungry, Gene?
but I always wondered what it would be like to have a big family, to have a bunch of people that cared about each other, who enjoyed being together, and I have to tell you that...
all of you have made that dream come true for me.
I mean, I have old friends who have been there for me through good times and bad, a handsome son who makes me prouder to be his father with every day that passes, and a beautiful friend who shares a part of me that no one else could ever really understand...
and of course our guests, who, uh...
I think really bring home the true meaning of friendship and family.
[Oven timer dings]s] My birds!
now, this isn't exactly the way I would have had things planned, but...
looking back at it, I wouldn't have it any other way.
in fact, I can't think of one other thing that would make this moment any better.
Hey, it's snowing!
except snow.
Wow.
Hey, where's Nigel?
[Alex]: There he is!
what's he doing?
he's playing in the snow.
[Walt]: He's going to catch a cold out there, that crazy old coot.
looks like fun, though.
I'm going to join him.
me too.
count me in.
snowball fight!
two old coots freezing.
ladies and gentlemen, may I present the turducken.
Where'd everybody go?
I had the perfect life until I was in a coma for six years, and then I woke up and found my fiancee married to another man...
and they're raising my son.
everything has changed...
including me.
one touch, and I can see things, things that happened, things that will happen.
you should see what I see.
congressman Stillson, meet senator Harlan Ellis.
Miranda, darling, I'd like you to meet a friend of the family.
daddy.
this is greg stillson, a young man with a very bright future.
it's a quantum leap up the social ladder for somebody like stillson.
beauty, brains...and a gambler's heart
lethal combination.
what do you want?
a union between the two of you could help take him to the top.
and you with him?
and if I refuse?
people will die.
will you do me the honor of becoming my wife?
I will.
it must have been so hard on you losing him.
I didn't lose him. I killed my father.
there was an accident.
say it.
you told her.
what does that have to do with anything?
you may assure the congressman that he has a loyal subscriber.
I already have.
take a good look at me right now.
I am afraid of him. I want your blessing to break off this relationship.
we finally meet, Mr. Smith.
now, if thou canst read the writing...
they shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.
the choice is yours, Mr. Smith.
local law enforcement remains on high alert today after an article in the boston telegraph published an internal white house list of the U. S. Locations most vulnerable to terrorist attack.
maine's durham point oil refinery is among the sites listed
not for breakfast.
the point that I was making
what do you think of the article in today's paper concerning homeland security?
well, I think it's obvious that this country needs to redirect its resources and attention in respect to global terrorism, but this is not the way to do it.
whoever leaked that report needs to be brought to face federal charges.
switching gears for a bit, how are your wedding plans coming?
well, you know, I am a politician, so I don't have any problem delegating authority.
I've left most of the big decisions to my better half.
I think it's safe to say, this will be the happiest day of my life.
this is really going to happen.
can you help me in the front?
Yeah,Francesca, I think we need to take it in another inch, don't you?
Oh, I think it looks perfect.
what are you doing here?
I came to see you.
well, you can't be here.
I'm getting married in less than 36 hours.
Yeah, I saw your future husband on television.
he's almost as good an actor as you are.
miss ellis?
Yeah, just a minute!
you have to go.
say it. -Say what?
tell me that you love Greg Stillson.
say those words, and I'll walk away.
Johnny, please.
what are you afraid of? It's just the two us.
you can be honest.
I love greg stillson.
I was wrong.
you're a much better actor.
you don't understand.
look, I saw you make that deal to protect me.
then why are you doing this to me?
you know I will not be responsible for your death, and it's not just for you.
it's for me, for my father.
so you just, uh, go along with the charade, pretending that you're happy about marrying a man you don't love?
does stillson know about the deal?
I don't know.
he's never mentioned it.
what I do know is that these people are not playing games.
maybe we can figure out a way out of this.
what are you talking about?
the man that offered you that deal, do you know who he is?
I never saw his face.
Why?
because he broke into my house the day that you came back, and he left me a message.
what kind of message?
I still haven't figured that out yet, but I think he's stillson's top new advisor.
I also think 's connected to purdy in some way.
I don't see how this changes anything.
well, whoever he is, he lives in the shadows, in the dark.
if I can figure out some way to draw him out of that, into the light, maybe we can make our own deal.
I don't know.
you can't give up without a fight.
miss Ellis?
is everything all right?
I'm going to figure this out,
I promise you.

he was just holding the wedding dress and crying?
that's what I saw.
well, that could mean anything.
maybe she called it off, and the old man lost his ticket to the white house.
maybe, but I don't intend to leave it to chance.
I'm telling you, it's all connected to this mystery man.
I can feel it in my bones.
I've been going over that bible passage that he left for you.
it's from the book of daniel.
the third ruler of the kingdom.
it sounds to me like he considers you an equal, like he's reaching out, trying to make a deal.
a deal?
come on. He has to know that I would never do anything to help him or stillson.
well, maybe he's trying to put a scare into you.
listen, Sarah's out of town.
I'm supposed to pick up JJ at school.
would you mind getting him for me?
Nah, no problem. -Thanks, man.
where are you going?
to put my own scare into somebody.
this is a sample table setting.
the china is 100 years old.
is this the official guest list?
is there a problem?
I don't even recognize half of these names.
Oh, I got the list from congressman stillson's chief of staff.
why is there a camera crew listed?
because the ceremony is going to be televised.
televised?
on the faith heritage network.
Greg and I thought it would be a good idea to reach out to the people, make them feel like part of the family.
dad, I don't want you turning this into a media circus.
what is it, a wedding or a political fundraiser?
both, if we do it right.
honey, a lot of people have a vested interest in greg stillson.
when they look at him, they see the future of this country.
and the future looks fantastic!
these are my absolute favorites.
they're so...delicate and unspoiled. You know?
well, there's my girl, right there.
we're really going to do this, aren't we?
it's going to be the social event of the season.
the guest list reads like a who's who of beltway power-brokers.
I hope we can leave some standing room for family and friends.
I see here you invited congressman kelly?
it's a tradition for a junior congressman to invite his senior counterpart.
tradition?
he's traditionally blocked every piece of legislation i've created.
now I've got to feed the fat bastard?
if you don't, people will think
that I'm afraid. Yeah, well, I'm not afraid.
like my daddy used to say, you keep your friends close and your enemies just a little bit closer.
put congressman kelly and his lovely wife at table one.
is that okay, baby?
you know what? I'm not feeling so good.
I think I'm going to lie down for a few minutes.
you want some company?
no. No, I'm just...
going to rest, that's all.
you do look a little pale. Did you see Dr. Knox?
I'm fine, daddy. Excuse me.
Dr. Knox?
he's treated her since she was a child.
saved her life.
is that right?
Miranda suffered from rheumatic fever when she was a little girl.
the illness damaged her heart.
she never mentioned that to me.
she wouldn't.
I was wondering if we could talk about something, Gene.
my door is always open to a friend.
we are friends, aren't we?
I mean, if you were in trouble, you could confide in me, right?
of course.
well, what's on your mind?
I understand that your subscriptions have tripled since you started broadcasting on satellite?
we are blessed to be able to take god's message to many people in need.
you know, I logged on to the ministry's website, and I downloaded some information.
it seems that people think you can perform miracles.
Johnny, I don't understand where this is going.
you've made some great strides in the last 10 months, gene, and it all seemed to begin when you made the jump to satellite.
you know, this picture was taken on the day you dedicated the ministry's new broadcast facility, and everyone in that picture was identified, except for one person.
can you tell me his name?
his name?
so what's his connection to faith heritage?
he's a supporter.
in fact, he was the first person to suggest taking the ministry global.
and where would I find Mr. Janus?
we usually meet here or at my home.
doesn't he have an office?
I'm sure he does...
I've never been there.
what can you tell me about him personally?
he's a businessman.
he owns or runs several international companies.
owns or runs, Gene?
I'm not sure.
you don't know much about this man, do you?
I know he offered me the opportunity to spread god's word, to send his message and his teachings to many people who might otherwise be overlooked, and in many ways, he has made my dreams for faith heritage come true.
and what did he ask for in return?
nothing.
he asked for nothing.
it's important we get out in front of this thing.
it might be smart to restate our position to homeland security.
Oh, I don't know about homeland security, but this offices could certainly use a little tightening up.
apparently, they'll let anybody in.
Greg, my boy.
you know my door's always open to an eager student of the game.
you know mike scannell, my chief aide?
of course I do.
I hear you're considering a run for mayor?
I'm weighing my options.
my congratulations on your upcoming wedding.
thank you very much.
I appreciate that.
I thought it was about time I entered the national scene.
how's that?
polls seem to indicate all I need is a wife and family to swing the southern states, so...
are we talking about pennsylvania avenue?
well, if we are, you didn't hear it from me.
I'll make sure these notes get incorporated into the text, sir.
congressman.
can I fix you a drink?
no, no.
you might need one, though.
how's that?
the press has got to be nipping at your heels over that newspaper article, considering you're committee chairman for homel and security. Any idea where that leak came from?
my people are looking into it. - Well, I'm certainly sorry about that.
it's got to be embarrassing, seeing how hard you fought for that appointment.
you know, Greg, your arrogance is one of the big reasons that you're not further ahead in your career.
is that right?
people will put up with an unlikable leader as long as they don't feel like they're being sold down the river.
but your desperate ambition for higher office-- it scares the average voter.
makes them feel like you don't respect their needs.
now, I,on the other hand, have no ambition beyond the office that I presently represent.
let's just cut to the chase, shall we?
you've blocked just about every move I've made, and, quite frankly, I'm sick and tired of it.
I'd just like for it to stop. - Or else?
I can help you through this messy situation, or I can step aside and watch you get run over.
that choice is yours. - You don't scare me, son.
neither does that cold-blooded phantom that's pulling your strings.
people around here don't like outsiders.
so why don't you just go on back and tell your master that I said to go straight to hell?
well, senator, Miranda and I look forward to seeing you at the wedding.
you take care.
sanctimonious son of a bitch. He wouldn't even consider a deal.
that's unfortunate.
now we'll have to do it the hard way.
Yeah, well, I don't care how you get it done. Just make sure that old man gets out of my way.
it's already in the works.
I've run janus backwards and forwards, and I got nothing.
either that's not his name, or the guy really is a ghost.
he's real.
by the way purdy reacted, he's also dangerous.
Miranda Ellis, please. She's not back yet?
well, I realize she's getting married tomorrow. No, there's no message. Thank you.
maybe walt can help.
no, the white house raised the terror alert because of the article in the paper.
he's at the oil refinery helping with security.
hello.
I've been thinking about the conversation we had earlier.
um... I've made some inquiries and come up with an address that might help you answer some questions.
have you got a pen?
okay, I've got it. - It appears someone has their hand in the cookie jar.
Hello?
I can explain.
the situation is crystal clear from where I'm standing.
you're out of those shortbread cookies I enjoy so much.
I'll have Mrs. Campion bake you up a batch.
I need your assistance on a matter of great importance.
you want my help? - As you may know, congressman stillson and i have grown quite close since the unexpected death of his father.
I wasn't aware of that.
in many ways, he looks upon me as a surrogate parent, an advisor in matters of both professional and personal regard.
I see.
the congressman is, at his core, a simple man, from humble beginnings.
so much so that, um, he feels himself inadequate in expressing certain communications-- matters of the heart, for instance.
matters of the heart?
the congressman has approached me in extreme confidence and asked that I put into words some unexpressed feelings relating to his bride-to-be, expressions that he would have you recite at the appropriate time.
are we talking about wedding vows?
vows? Um, no. No.
a testimonial, a public attestation of emotion.
at the congressman's request, the envelope is to remain sealed until the appropriate time.
I understand.
it's crucial that each of us understand our roles in the turbulent days ahead, that we weigh the consequences of our actions. Don't you agree?
I do. - I do indeed.
till death do us part, reverend... words we can all live by.
you're sure this is the address that purdy gave you?
no, this is it.
Yeah, well, looks like another janus dead end.
like the hotel room where Stillson killed his father.
I swear to god.
$28 an hour to sit here doing nothing.
it's actually pretty boring.
it's a front. - A front?
there wasn't any business here.
it was supposed to look that way. - What about Janus?
I believe the public has a fundamental right to know if they're being adequately protected from terrorism.
I don't need to remind you of what's at stake for you here personally, how this might affect your career.
I appreciate your concern for national security, but if I were you, I'd be more concerned about your own.
your career, the safety of your family-- these are all very fragile things.
that's a wise decision.
I'll expect to see the story in tuesday's edition.
it was Janus.
he's the one who leaked the security information to the newspaper.
of course he was.
Yeah, he was on the phone about it, and he had circled the name of a boston telegraph reporter.
it was the same reporter who broke the story in today's paper.
if you can prove that janus was the source of the leak, you can bring him down.
and save miranda.
but you'll have to convince the reporter to go public with his name.
we don't have much time.
Roger, I can't do it.
because I can't reveal a source. Oh, that's nice. Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?
excuse me. - Yeah, just a sec.
okay. Go.
I want to talk to you about an article you wrote.
Jeremy, there's, like, a thousand phone messages here from all over the country.
everybody wants-- me to reveal the name of my source.
tell them that's not going to happen.
tell them that if bob woodward can keep deep throat a secret for 30 years,
I can protect my source for at least the weekend.
can I talk to you for a minute?
look, man, I'd love to, but I've got a lot to do before I go to jail.
so, you're not going to reveal your source to the grand jury?
I know you. You're, uh...
John Smith. - The psychic, that's right.
I spent three months trying to get an exclusive with you.
you never returned my calls. - I've been busy.
Oh, right. - Hey. I'm a jerk.
What'd they do, they send you here to see if you could find out my source?
actually, I know who it is. - Oh, yeah, you do?
Yeah. I do.
unfortunately, it doesn't do me any good unless the name goes public.
but you know what? It's a long story.
people have a right to know the truth, John, but they also have the same right to their privacy.
but you'd rather go to jail? - It's a complicated world.
here's my home number in case you ever change your mind about that interview.
how about we do it right now?
you've had an exciting career, huh?
Yeah, if you like crappy food and lousy hotels.
you have a beautiful wife.
Karen.
so when's the baby due?
right. Mind if I take a couple photos of you first?
I didn't come here to do the interview. - You're wasting my time.
I know you're angry and frustrated. There's a lot of things you don't know.
there are events in motion that need to be stopped. - What kind of events?
Jer, we're out of topsoil. Can you
Oh, sorry. I didn't realize you had company.
John Smith, this is my wife, Karen.
John was just leaving.
listen, time is running out.
please try to reconsider this. - I'm sorry. I can't.
God! You scared me.
what are you doing? - What's it look like i'm doing?
Oh, Greg, we can't sleep together the night before our wedding. That's bad luck.
you can't be serious.
okay, miranda, what's-- what'S... what's wrong?
I saw the way you looked at that girl today.
you're angry because I looked at a girl?
Oh, baby, come on. That's what men do--we look at girls.
you do more than just look.
okay, what do you want from me? - I want to be able to trust you.
you can trust me, miranda. What would make you think you can't trust me?
okay, you know what? When I told you about my father
I don't want to talk about that.
would you just hear me out? Please?
look, I know I'm not what you're used to, all right?
I didn't come from a big, rich family.
I grew up dirt poor. Everything that I had, I had to scratch and I had to claw for.
maybe I've done some things that I'm not proud of, and it might have scarred me in places the eyes can't see. I don't know.
but baby... I'm determined to make a new life for us.
and I know I can.
I would never hurt you.
I love you.
trust me.
I love you.
and now...
I'm going to go.
if I'd known love was going to be this lonely, I'd have got myself a dog.
good night. - Good night.
son of a bitch.
Miranda. - I had to see you.
are you all right? - I can't do it.
I thought I could, but I can't.
Hey.
we'll figure it out.
I don't even know what I'm doing.
it's okay. I understand.
come on, I'll fix us some coffee.
his name is Janus, Malcolm Janus.
what else did you find out about him?
not much, but I'm sure that he's the source behind the leak to the newspaper, and I tried to convince the reporter to reveal his source, but he refused.
well, that means we don't have any leverage, no way to force janus to back off from his threats.
well, I haven't given up yet.
maybe it's just as well.
what would I tell everyone?
tell the truth.
tell them you don't love stillson and this was all a big mistake.
I really felt for greg earlier.
he seemed so sincere. - This guy killed his own father.
don't forget that.
you have to remember what he's capable of.
Yeah.
the sun's coming up. I'd better go.
Hey, don't give up yet. - No.
you have to let this go, John, for me.
I can't keep going back and forth like this.
you have to promise me that you won't keep trying to find me.
goodbye.
a little early for gardening, isn't it?
it's cooler before the sun gets high.
I'm going to go up the street to the bakery, get some bagels.
if the phone rings, don't pick it up. It's just people wanting a comment about the trial later today.
see?
what?
you ever get the feeling you're doing the wrong thing for all the right reasons?
let's check the carrots, huh?
you don't know about carrots? Oh, you're going to love them.
you've reached jeremy and karen. Leave a message. We'll get back to you.
Jeremy, this is John Smith. Keep your wife out of the garden.
it's a little early for gardening, isn't it?
it's cooler before the sun gets high.
I'm going to go up the street to the bakery, get some bagels.
if the phone rings, don't pick it up.
it's just people wanting a comment about the trial later today.
see? - Come on, answer the damn phone.
you've reached jeremy and karen. Leave a message
check the carrots...
you don't know about carrots?
Karen, back up!
Mr. Janus.
I never grasped the notion of running until one's lungs explode as an endorsement for healthy living.
what's on your mind? - The future.
more to the point, yours-- both personal and professional.
if this is about Miranda, I had a long heart-to-heart with her last night.
she's, uh, she's not going to be a problem. - That's excellent news.
I'm curious, did this heart-to-heart happen before or after she went to Johnny Smith's house?
what are you talking about?
they spent several hours inside the house.
she got home just before daylight.
I don't understand. Why would she...
perhaps if you spoke to her again?
speak to her?
what would you suggest i speak to her about? Johnny Smith?
it seems like that's the only thing we have in common anymore.
Nah, this...
this is going to go on and on.
how would you suggest i handle the situation?
I'll leave that decision up to you.
this is a turning point for us, Malcolm.
don't disappoint me.
are you okay? - I didn't see it.
how did you know it was there? - It's a long story.
so, it can't kill anyone now?
not for a few hours. Not until it has a chance to produce more venom.
it'll make you sick as a dog.
this particular venom affects the heart.
may I ask what you need it for?
somebody wants to send a message. How much for the venom?
I can't sell that to you. Just a pin prick of this stuff can kill a person.
I guess I'll just have to take it, then.
Karen! What happened?
okay. Two hours and counting.
that's all?
I didn't realize it was so late. - Are you okay?
Yeah, just over-excited.
because, you know, I could pull the car around back, and you and i could be in canada by the time they cut the cake.
Canada?
it was a joke. - Yeah.
Hey.
I'd like to speak to Miranda, if I could.
um, right now? - It's all right, katy.
could you get me some water? - I'll be right back.
I don't think she likes me too much. - She doesn't know you.
I just wanted to see you one last time.
you know, before-- before we get married.
I meant everything I said last night.
I don't think i've ever bared my soul like that to anyone.
I love you, Miranda.
I just wanted to tell you that. That's all.
I think it was meant as a warning. - A warning?
somebody wanted to scare you, somebody who's afraid that you might talk.
that thing could have killed my wife, my child.
look, people get nervous. You know, lives are on the line.
the question now is, what are you going to do to protect yourself?
Yeah, Andy, it's Jeremy. How fast can you get a press conference together?
congressman, can we ask you a few questions?
is this being broadcast live?
on the faith heritage network. - Ah, Stillson loves his camera time.
congressman, given your stormy history with Greg Stillson, are you surprised to be here today?
congressman Stillson and I disagree about how best to run this state, but today is about family, and on that subject, I think we're both in agreement. Excuse me.
congressman, one more question
it's a good thing you kept that business card.
the important thing is that we get Janus' name on the record as the source of the security leak.
Miranda's set to go down the aisle in less than an hour.
here we go.
thank you for coming on such short notice. I believe in the power of the press.
I've dedicated my life to it, but my family hasn't.
there's a threat to our liberty, but it's not from foreign aggressors. It comes from within.
it saddens me to reveal a source I've sworn to protect, but whom I feel has violated that trust.
my source's name is
congressman pat kelly's chief of staff.
did he just say scannell?
what have I done?
Janus was not blackmailing jeremy tomlin. It was scannell.
how? - Well, he must've set him up, or dug up some dirt on him, or something to get him to go along with the idea.
I'm sure scannell never knew who he was dealing with.
he used the snake to put the fear of god into tomlin because he knew that he'd name scannell and bring down stillson's biggest political obstacle. It's actually brilliant.
and I helped him every step of the way.
what do you need it for? - Somebody wants to send a message.
how much for the venom?
the venom. - The what?
in my vision, janus' security guy took the snake and a vial of venom.
Yeah, but what do you need snake venom for?
just a pin prick of this stuff can kill a person.
Miranda. It has to be miranda.
hold on.
I hope you're not contemplating a jump?
Where's katy? - I believe she had an emergency phone call.
family matter.
I don't believe we've formally been introduced.
I know who you are.
I'd appreciate it if you'd leave.
weddings are one of those ancient rituals I've never understood.
did you know that very few members of the animal kingdom actually mate for life?
well, you'd be the expert on animal behavior.
there's a tribe in Africa...
where the bride's entire family enters the sleeping hut the morning after the wedding, and if there's no blood found in the marriage bed, the woman is dragged to the center of the village and stoned to death.
it's considered a sign of betrayal.
it's fortunate that civilization has come so far, wouldn't you agree?
why are you here?
I bring a peace offering from the groom.
the congressman had planned to present them to you sooner, but as fortune would have it, he misplaced one of them.
I know how much it would mean to him to have you wear them today.
stunning.
truly... stunning.
congressman Kelly, what's your reaction to Jeremy Tomlin's statement indicating your office as the source of leaked information concerning homeland security?
what are you talking about?
Tomlin just finished a press conference in which he claims to have documentation and recordings of your top aide passing security documents.
no comment. Let's go.
one more question, sir.
it's Miranda!
she's not breathing!
almost two days after the news of Miranda Ellis' tragic death, and still her friends and family remain numb.
it seems unfathomable that such a young, energetic woman could be gone so suddenly.
as her family, including grieving fiance congressman greg stillson, honored her last wishes to have her ashes spread on the ocean she loved so much.
miss Ellis suffered from a heart condition as the result of a childhood illness.
unfortunately, that heart proved too weak to realize what should have been the happiest day of her young life.
Miranda Ellis was 24 years old.
you can't sit here all day.
you see this?
congressman Kelly resigned today. They did it, Bruce.
they did it all.
the television says miranda had a heart condition. Right?
her father confirmed it in the newspaper. - She was poisoned.
why do you think she was cremated so quickly? - You should have gone to the police.
with what? Visions?
these people don't leave loose ends. Did you see this article?
it's about how Stillson is seen as a grieving fiance, and how that translates into votes.
you think they didn't know that?
Oh, man, I'm not even here.
I owe you an apology. - What are you talking about, Gene?
Malcolm Janus came to see me a couple days ago.
he gave me this envelope and told me not to open it until the proper time.
he said he'd written it for Greg Stillson, something concerning Miranda.
Janus wrote something about Miranda?
it's not even his handwriting, I checked.
he'd just deny it.
but there's no way on earth to prove that this came from him.
I assumed that it was something to do with the wedding ceremony.
after miranda collapsed... I opened it and read it.
what's in the envelope, gene?
it's her eulogy.
the son of a bitch wrote her eulogy the day before she died!
for Michael 1948-2005
I had the perfect life until
I was in a coma for six years and then I woke up and found my fiancee married to another man...
and they're raising my son
everything has changed...
including me
one touch and I can see things things that happened things that will happen
you should see what I see
anybody hear about this "colorful" little incident in L. A?
seems a bunch of black kids shouting "black power
beat the crap out of two white high school geeks
the cops refuse to classify it as a bias crime Talk about double standards
heard about that seattle korps
when are people gonna learn that racism isn't just a "white thang"?
time to pick a side 'cause rahowa is coming!
yo, yo, Seattle Korps
where you been, dude?
feels like the twilight zone but the yokels call it "maine.
my dad in his infinite wisdom decided to ditch the pacific northwest
make a new start
must be some local skins you can hang with
Yeah, only now he's threatening to ship me to military school
you believe it?
life's a bitch and then you die, my brother
still, lethal skills may come in handy
like blitz says the war's coming
one cannot understand intolerance without understanding its roots...
and its roots lie in fear and ignorance
nowhere is this clearer than in the chasm that the terrible events of 911
opened between muslims and christians a chasm we've just begun to bridge
it wasn't muslims who crashed those planes...
but extremists who abandoned the central tenets of their faith
peace and love the same values we cherish - Who is he, gene? - William cotton
a former seattle minister who's getting involved in local politics
there should never be another excuse for muslims and christians to go to war
he is a forceful speaker with an important message---tolerance
I'm not sure everyone's getting it
dialogue is the key
not to mention press coverage
this is the first time the festival has enjoyed this amount of media coverage
thank you for stopping by, john - Yeah - Excuse me
I'd rather be bowling... enjoying my morning off
now it all makes sense
if it isn't my favorite psychic
you're a network correspondent
Boston isn't exactly new york or even washington but it's a start
how'd you get roped into covering purdy's shindig?
my bosses remembered i started out editing the student newspaper
Oh, speaking of which
I'd like you to meet the current editor, josh
hold on, Josh
Yeah,"the miracle of cleaves mills.
Reverend purdy likes to drop your name in his sermons - Don't believe everything you hear, josh - I don'T
and so I leave you with just one word--- tolerance
let us all embrace it, Thank you
no idea what triggered it?
no, man, the crowd was so thick
I could've gotten a vision off of anyone
but you're sure that it was a racist killing?
well, whoever did it painted the words "white power,
plus another word i didn't understand - Rahowa? - Ra-ho-what?
it's an acronym Means racial holy war-- the jihad every good little white supremacist hopes and prays for
Dana, I,uh...
meant to say goodbye but got caught up in something?
sounds familiar
mind if I tag along?
so, splash of milk, no sugar, right?
Yeah, roscoe said that walt would be another five minutes
Oh, there he is - Dana - how are you?
so the psychic and the reporter
kind of makes you feel nostalgic doesn't it?
Yeah, kind of
so how've you been?
not bad, considering
considering?
that covers some ground, And you?
well, with the help of copious amounts of therapy
I've managed to break some bad habits like falling for very successful but manipulative men
don't worry, You didn't qualify on either count
thanks
anyway, I decided to put my social life on hold and focus on my career
so how's that working out?
great as far as my career goes
So...a handsome tabloid hero like yourself how come I'm not reading about you and angelina jolie?
we're keeping it on the down-low
haven't found the right gal - I've found one or two - Really?
the doctor is in
Oh, we're on
most of my likely suspects have either drifted out of the area or are in jail on other charges
and there's no record of a crime like this that already happened?
none that match john's vision
so it's definitely in the future
so, what do you know about some of the more extreme fundamentalist groups attending purdy's festival?
well, some pro-lifers want to protest a local family planning center but other than that very little
faith heritage is its own little world
they even have their own police force
we should check with them
campus cops? Forget it
I have my own sources
okay, good
you tell them we're running color?
all right
if your clips are strong
I'd be glad to recommend you for an internship
seducing my staff to the dark side?
selling your soul isn't a requirement for working in tv though I guess it never hurts
bad time for a victory lap
I'm not here to poach a story if that's what you're worried about
we need your help
look, I know you have your doubts about me but my visions are real and I had one this morning about a murder - No poaching - Cross my heart
meet william cotton, the '90s version with a decidedly different slant on interfaith tolerance
this is the same guy?
Oh, yeah, It took an F. O.I. Request to get the feds to cough up that surveillance photo
for someone who lectures on tolerance he certainly keeps some odd company
why would purdy bring him here? Isn't he aware of his past?
I don't know
I wanted to run the story before giving anyone a chance to spin it but cotton, the new guy, has credentials
he wrote this book on muslim-christian relations that made him the go-to guy on the college speaking tour
what if he's genuinely turned over a new leaf?
well, check this out
this is the home page for the american liberty organization
it's the political party cotton started when he moved here from seattle
now, superficially, it's clean but if you look a little deeper literally, you'll see the cotton site is cross-linked to all these others having to do with government conspiracies ultra-violent video games even some of the less virulent supremacist web forums
now, these are all sites that are frequented by young alienated teens
in other words he's still recruiting from the same pool
our philosophy is simple--- less government in people's lives
socially, it means promoting tolerance "Live and let live
you seem to be reaching out mostly to young males
well, they're the future
I was hoping you'd be more revealing
I was hoping you'd explain why you're using a psychic as your cameraman
Mr. Smith, isn't it?
my regular guy got sick - Is that so? - Well, it's my fault
I should have introduced myself
there's a story running tomorrow in the faith heritage student newspaper
it claims you have ties to certain right-wing organizations
my past is no state secret, ms. Bright
it's been misconstrued by the liberal media
in what way, sir?
to promote tolerance you have to understand the roots of intolerance
I'm afraid i've got to cut this short
I guess we'll be leaving, then
sorry - Is this your son? - Yes, it is
do you think we could talk to him get his perspective on his father's political career?
I'm afraid darryl's busy packing
I'm sending him to school overseas
too bad, Maybe next time
only thing I could find is this stolen vehicle report out of seattle
a couple of years ago cotton reports his son's car stolen and then calls back the next day to say they found it abandoned
not very damning, is it?
Walt, we've got a problem - Bannerman - Great
wallet I. D.S him as rashid mahmud cleaves mills address 80 bucks inside
so much for robbery
they painted the motive on the wall
this hasn't gone to forensics yet, so...
if you want to touch a corner...
it's a victoria cross
it was awarded to his grandfather during world war ii
from father to son to son
okay, john
you're on
stop! Why are you doing this?
where did all these people come from?
someone has a police scanner
they heard about a hate crime
this kind of stuff doesn't happen here
well, it does now
is there a preliminary cause of death?
blunt trauma to the head
we haven't found a weapon yet
you think it could have been a baseball bat?
something you're not telling me, john?
I think rashid knew the person who killed him
okay, so we'll check out his friends family and acquaintances
if this is a hate crime people are going to be screaming for an arrest
that's exactly why i don't want to point a finger until I'm sure - You called them? - Yeah
the media's going to be all over this I thought
I might as well get a head start
what's between us stays between us
I'm standing outside the home of rashid mahmud the young man whose bludgeoned body was found this morning only a few miles from here
news of the crime prompted reactions ranging from shock to sorrowful introspection in this small-town community which this week played host to a religious conference sponsored by the reverend gene purdy's faith heritage alliance
I spoke with reverend purdy this afternoon following an afternoon prayer service
every day brings us news of some terrible yet distant crime
when a crime in our midst raises the specter of intolerance we are forced to stop and take stock and question our own prejudices
cleaves mills is a god-fearing community
I believe this is an aberration but like the tip of an iceberg we have to examine carefully and thoroughly what may lie below the surface
others might question that statement among them, josh blake editor of the faith heritage student newspaper which today reported that a local speaker at purdy's conference william cotton, has white supremacist ties William Cotton
do you feel like there could e a connection with this crime?
well, that's not for me to say but the fact that cotton's building a political organization here scares me
scared is how most people here feel
scared about the end of one small town's innocence
I don't know why I keep it on
I guess I keep hoping for some explanation something that tells what happened...
it's okay, syeda, It's okay
you have news about my son's murderer?
Yeah, we have information that suggests your son knew his attacker
did rashid have any enemies that you knew of?
enemies? No
he was a very kind... shy boy
you can't think of anyone who might want to hurt him?
no
I'm very sorry about your family's loss, sir
we called it the "fast-a-thon.
over 150 colleges participated and the idea was to give non-muslim students a taste for the meaning of ramadan and for what it's like for the poor to go hungry
see, rashid?
a college girl who's also observant
faith and good works
the path to salvation as the koran says
I hear you're applying to college, rashid
what are your top choices?
I was hoping to find a school close to home, Not too close, I hope
the way he eats, we can't afford him
Mr. Mahmud...
we'll find who did this to your son
I promise
learn anything new?
nothing that helps us
Hey, my car just died
can you handsome fellows give me a lift?
I got a tip where we might find darryl cotton
we?
but we might want to pick up a pair of earplugs first
man, do I feel old!
you're cold?
old! I feel old!
you guys know darryl cotton?
Hey, do you know darryl? - Yeah
Oh, could you hold on a second?
you guys!
Hey, you guys, this is billy
he knows darryl
is he here tonight?
was. I had to throw him out
he and his friends were getting too aggressive
these skinheads, they don't get it
they think it's all about violence
it's not, The music's about energy - Hey, try the alley - Thanks, man
that's him
so how do you usually handle a situation like this?
Hi, my name's johnny smith
I'm a psychic
I'd like to shake your hand and see if you're guilty of murder?
you two just, uh... stay close
excuse me
you guys wouldn't have happened to have seen a guy with a blue mohawk run through here?
guy jacked my car stereo
you sure you don't have that backwards, bro?
I'm sorry?
Yeah, you see, where I come from it's guys like you who jack stereos jack cars, jack pretty much anything that's not nailed down
who wants to know?
I'm john smith, I'm a psychic
I just really want to shake your hand - Why? - To see if you killed rashid mahmud
now, why would I kill that raghead?
well, for starters you and your boys here are obviously racist
second, the killer painted "white power" on a wall - Didn't he? - Yeah
and clearly you've got white power tats
so how about it?
get lost
not yet
tell me you didn't do this
I thought you'd be proud of me
it's what we stand for, isn't it?
get off me, freak!
I put a couple of butterfly band-aids on his cut
I got him to lie down for a while
Bruce really takes his job seriously, doesn't he?
his job?
taking care of you
I guess he does
well, I seem to remember putting in for that job once myself - It's my producer - Yeah
Yes, gary
I know I've been off the clock, but
no, I didn't know that
Yes. Okay. Okay
Yes, I'm on it
the articles of faith website just posted a story saying that the police have a suspect and that you led them to him
what?
I have to go but I may have to call you later for a quote - Yeah - All right, see you
I can't believe i lost it like that last night
it's understandable, man
well, yeah He provoked me
well, I meant because of what happened the night you turned 17
your dad let you borrow his car, right?
I saw it yesterday, right here when you touched me on the shoulder
saw me getting pulled over and beat up by those rednecks for dating a white girl?
I bet that's not the only time you had to deal with racism, right?
I'm still dealing with it
the convenience store clerk who's checking his surveillance mirror when I'm standing in the back or the middle-aged woman who casually crosses the street when she sees me coming
makes me think that a punk like cotton is just vocalizing stuff that's in everybody's subconscious
Yeah, but "everybody" isn't killing people
they're not covering them with white paint and writing racist slogans on the walls, Come on
which is why i want us to nail him
thing is, you've touched just about everything there is to touch
give me the flashlight stand there and face away from me, all right?
now...
the killer would've stood here
Oh, you think standing in his footsteps will trigger a vision
maybe, if we could find them
it wasn't a baseball bat...
and darryl cotton was not the killer
Mr. Blake has done us a service by pointing out william cotton's ties to certain extreme elements
past ties that we were unaware of
Mr. Cotton may have made a break with his past but his son's involvement in this crime reminds us that our failure to confess openly and atone for our sins is what condemns us to repeat them
nice sermon, gene
there's only one problem
the story isn't true
the paper stands by every word
Oh, yeah?
Darryl cotton is not a murderer
I've been assured by the sheriff's department they're seeking him as we speak
tonight, I will be leading a candelight vigil and tomorrow, a march in memory of rashid mahmud
we've got a witness who put the cotton kid with the victim the night of the murder
a witness?
Yeah, the news stories must have spooked him
Walt's got everyone out shaking the trees
if you would have come to us sooner we could've brought him in quietly
I didn't want to implicate him till I was sure
and now you're sure he's innocent?
look, I had a vision that he committed an assault
I don't think it's this one but I just need to talk to your witness
I told the cops everything I know
why did you wait to come forward?
I didn't realize the kid was a suspect until I saw it on the news
Hey, all I know is that they left together
the other kid he sat right here
it only looked like they left together
rashid went around back and got into a car
Walt, I'm telling you darryl did not do it
John, there have been some developments while you were out
developments?
this is dana bright reporting live with a wpkv exclusive
Darryl cotton, sought-after by police in connection with the murder of a local teenager has surrendered...
and agreed to make a public statement in exchange for his confession
I've been accused of murder
some people are calling it a hate crime
well, if it's hate to stand up for what you believe in then I plead guilty
they, uh... they say the victim of my hate was a pakistani kid, an immigrant
well, I don't hate immigrants
how could I?
I'm descended from immigrants
but my ancestors...
white, protestant europeans...
they built this country
they made it what it is or at least what it was
now the people that they call "immigrants,
arabs, asians, mexicans they don't come here to build but to exploit to take what they can for themselves
it's unbelievable
just like the blacks and the jews and all the other minorities
all they want to do is tear this country down
so do I feel hatred?
yes
hatred for them and for anyone else who would turn a blind eye while they try to drag us back into the muck that they came from
my father taught me that this is war
you choose a side or you die
son of a bitch
all right, cuff him
well, what do you think, john?
he still sound innocent to you?
what do you want from me, john?
the kid confessed
hell, he's proud of it
Hey, walt something is wrong here
you said you saw him involved in an assault
maybe your visions mixed up the particulars
no, I know what I saw and I know what I didn't see
what are we disagreeing about?
I don't have time, dana, okay?
he found me, johnny
Darryl asked to make that statement
excuse me
listen, walt...
I had another vision
I saw darryl being taken out of here, dead - Dead? How? - I don't know
all right, I'll keep him in isolation put a suicide watch on him
he's not arraigned till monday so he'll be safe until then, all right?
all right. Thanks
if darryl's innocent, why did he cop to it?
good question
right now, I'm more worried about finding the real killer
where do we start?
my father is a photographer and I keep finding more pictures of rashid
you two were very close
when we came to america neither of us spoke english
we only had each other
so he'd never keep anything from you?
Tahmina, I'm a psychic
when I was here before I had a vision of a date that I think was arranged by your parents for rashid
now, the girl was very attractive and very intelligent but he didn't seem too interested and then he looked at you
is there anything else that you didn't tell the police about your brother?
was there another girlfriend that he had that he didn't want anyone to know about?
rashid didn't have a girlfriend
Tahmina, was your brother gay?
our parents would never understand
he was going to tell them, but...
did rashid have someone that he was close to?
they met on the internet
he never said his name but I saw an email and it was signed "J.
Jay, like j-a-y?
just the initial
Tahmina, do you have anything that your brother would have touched?
he gave me these for my birthday
no. Not here
I don't care what the koran says any more than you should care what the bible says
how can you say that?
because I know what we feel isn't wrong
Josh, look at me, I'm going to do this
I'm going to tell my parents that we've been seeing each other
if you can't handle that, then...
okay. Let's go inside
please! Why are you doing this?
Blake's not at his dorm or at his newspaper
I've got an apb out on his car
what are the chances that the murder weapon's still in his trunk?
none of this explains why darryl would confess to a murder that he didn't commit
want to give it a shot?
are those his? - Yeah. Go ahead
they're not evidence
I'm still seeing darryl dead, walt
we've got a guard at his cell
it's not going to happen here
it's going to happen somehow if I don't find out how or why
what's she doing here?
she's doing a cross-check on our records on the cottons
so you found anything?
you said you had a vision of darryl cotton attacking someone with a baseball bat?
look at this
the night william cotton reported his son's car being stolen in seattle there were three murders
two by gunshot, and the other cause of death was blunt trauma
the autopsy found flakes of aluminum in the wounds indicating that the weapon could've been a baseball bat
what about the victim?
it was a black teenager
the murder still remains unsolved
I think the police think it's a feud between rival gangs of car thieves
car thieves... and a stolen car - Thanks, dana - You bet
we'll be right outside
I confessed!
what more do you want from me?
look, I know who killed rashid
right now, I'm more concerned about what may happen to you, all right?
me? They got me on suicide watch
do you think I'm suicidal?
why else would you confess to a capital crime unless you wanted to punish yourself?
or is it someone else?
what your father maybe?
I've said all I have to say
that's the beauty of it because you don't have to say anything
come on! Whoo!
well, well, well...
No!
do it
come on, do it, darryl
do it!
it's a war, son
you choose sides or you die
choose sides or die?
I hated him for that. I hated myself!
and now he wants to send me away like none of it ever happened
it's time to make it right, darryl
get away from my son
what's going on here?
he's being released to his father
what?
he got a court order dismissing darryl's confession as coerced
you can't take him out of here
the hell I can'T, Get out of my way
what happened?
his father got him released
they're taking him out now
Yeah, well, good luck getting him out of here
purdy decided to end his march outside
come on
we need some room here, please
let's get some room
excuse me
back it up. Back it up
it's blake
he's here to shoot darryl and shut him up before he can recant his confession
I'll go after him, You warn darryl, all right?
all right, all right, Move back
it's over, josh
it's over. It's over
you saved a life today
you both did
one dead kid two more that'll be tried for murder...
don't know if we can call that a victory
you think you recognize the face of hatred...
it's just the idea that a young man like josh blake could be moved to hate and fear his own nature because of his faith and to lash out at others...
or how about darryl cotton trying to be a good son even if it meant hating and killing?
this town needs to heal
it's a time for reflection... and for prayer
how do you do that, gene?
just pray things get better?
you begin by asking that question
this is dana bright with a wpkv exclusive...
I was pretty hard on you, wasn't I?
you're a lot harder on yourself... but I forgive you
I really just... came here to...
you know, I just wanted to say...
goodbye, so... goodbye
it was really good seeing you again
yeah
sometimes I just feel like you're carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders
if you ever want to lighten the load you know where to reach me
I say it's crap!
now they're claiming some faggot church boy killed that raghead
don't believe the media
just remember who owns it
Yeah, I know our boy did it
pardon my jumping in but can I add my voice to the choir?
welcome to the fold, O.C
how's the weather out there?
sunny and warm
a perfect day to start a war
Amen to that, brother man
I had the perfect life until I was in a coma for six years, and then I woke up and found my fiancee married to another man...
and they're raising my son.
everything has changed...
including me.
one touch, and I can see things, things that happened, things that will happen.
you should see what I see.
Ooh, watch it.
I called the other parents. Everybody's home.
when was the last time you talked to her? - About 4: 00.
she was taking J. J. To the little league game, but that's been over for hours now.
did you try her cell? - Voice mail.
maybe they stopped to eat.
we were supposed to hook up for pizza after the game. She even left me a note telling me to meet her.
what is it, John? Did you see Sarah?
what did you see?
it's a 2004 silver jeep liberty.
license plate romeo-4-hotel, 8-3-2.
Roscoe, what's the story, man? Come on.
we've contacted local A.A.A. The gas stations, nothing.
all right, well, I want the interstate toll booths checked,
I want all these cars, I want them out of here, and a forensics team in here right away.
they're here already. - Well, put them to work, then, Roscoe.
forensics, hey!
you seen anything?
no.
I can't stop thinking about what you saw.
Walt, don't do this. It'll to be fine.
you saw my wife bound and gagged.
what about that's going to turn out fine, John?
you need to stay focused.
all right?
what would Sarah say if she were here, huh?
she'd say,"have faith. Do the best you can.
well, that sounds like good advice.
he stole Sarah's cell phone, then he took off.
what did he look like, John?
he was wearing a hood.
something doesn't feel right about this.
it seems like Sarah was the target right from the beginning, doesn't it?
any luck finding the jeep?
no, it's like they vanished into thin air.
I'm going to backtrack some of the side roads.
I'll ride with you. - Yeah, let's roll.
all right, let's go over this again.
you saw a man sitting in a chair, and then you saw Sarah in the bedroom.
that's right.
well, is there anything else that could give us a location?
it was dark. I couldn't see very much.
well, could the guy that stole her cell phone be the same guy sitting in the chair?
I guess. I couldn't see his face.
well, was he tall, short, fat, thin, black, white, what?
I'm not sure. - Well, what the hell did you see, John?
I mean, this is my family we're talking about, for Christ's sake.
there.
unit one? This is sheriff Bannerman.
I'm going to need a search team out to route 156, about six miles south of 17 junction, and I'm going to need a canine unit as well. Over.
copy that.
keys are still in the ignition.
there doesn't seem to be any damage.
Oh, look at this.
is that blood?
no, it's radiator fluid. There's holes in the radiator.
that's rad fluid, all right. Looks intentional.
it's embarrassing.
Oh, come on. What's wrong with a mother cheering for her son? Huh?
mom, you okay?
Oh, yeah. It's just something I ate didn't agree with me.
hang on.
what was that? - I don't know.
what are we going to do now?
don't worry. I'll call dad. It'll be fine.
have you seen my phone?
it's dark out there.
someone's coming. Stay here, okay?
looks like it's our lucky day.
Sarah couldn't get the engine started.
she waved down a truck. - What kind of truck?
I couldn't tell. The headlights were in my eyes.
well, did you see the driver? Was it the same guy from the park?
I don't know, Walt.
Jesus, John, you're there for everybody else when they need you.
it's an amazing thing, but right now it's Sarah and J.J. For crying out loud.
I want to find them as bad as you do.
I can't control my visions, though. You know that.
what now?
call in the big dogs.
how's the marriage, sheriff? - My marriage?
everything okay at home?
are you suggesting that I have something to do with this?
I have to consider every possibility. We're working with a deserted car.
it's possible that your wife may have set this up herself. I've seen it before.
let's get something straight. My marriage is fine.
my wife is the most stable person I ever met, and my son is a great kid, so why don't you cut the murder she wrote crap and tell me how you're going to help me find my family.
you're not the biological father, are you?
Jeez...
sir, I'm John Smith. I'm the biological father.
Johnny Smith... I've heard about you.
Yeah, then you know he's the real deal, right?
I told you what I saw. Sarah was bound and gagged.
I really respect what you do, Mr. Smith, but I can't allocate federal resources for something that could be attributed to a psychic hunch.
have you seen his track record in criminal cases?
I'd put it up against yours any day.
well, that very well might be, but, sheriff,
I have 37 missing persons cases currently on the books.
that's 37 husbands, wives, mothers, fathers going through the exact the same thing you're going through.
all right...
so, what is it that you want?
just hard evidence.
Walt, state police. - What's up?
they found a 10-year-old boy matching J.J.'S description in the middle of interstate 12.
he was bound and gagged.
that hard enough for you?
come on.
dad! - J. J!
Oh, J.J...
are you okay?
you're all right? You're not hurt, are you?
J. J.Do you know where mommy is?
did you see the man in the truck? The one that stopped to help you?
look, I know this is hard, okay, but it's really important.
what did he look like? Do you remember?
I didn't see his face.
Why? Because it was dark?
because of the mask.
the man who took your mom was wearing a mask?
what did it look like, J.J?
was it clear, J.J? Was he wearing a clear plastic mask?
it's impossible. - Is it?
somebody want to tell me what's going on?
Hey, J.J. Let's grab some water, huh, chief?
J. J.We'll be right here, okay?
a little while back, we had a case, a serial kidnapper.
guy wore a clear plastic mask.
what happened to him?
we tracked him to an industrial plant.
there was an explosion, a big fire. So he's dead?
well, the fire was fueled by chemicals. It burned for, like, five hours.
there were no remains.
there's no way he could have survived that heat.
if you're right, Sarah's abduction, it wasn't a random act.
it was revenge, John.
now looking left...
and to the right.
doc, he wasn't hurt, was he?
well, there were no physical injuries, but we did find traces of trichloromethane in his lungs.
is that chloroform?
son of a bitch...
I'd like to keep him for a day, just to be safe, but don't worry, Walt, he's a pretty tough kid.
I'm going to keep an officer stationed outside.
I'm not going to risk losing him again.
how's the boy? - He doesn't remember much.
maybe now we'll get some cooperation.
sheriff, I need to ask you a few more questions.
Oh, great, just what I need, more questions.
the man that you referred to as "the collector" in your report, - what can you tell me about him? - He's a psychopath.
he kidnaps women, tortures them, and then he throws them back into the woods.
you said this was revenge.
Yeah, we stopped the guy.
he got hurt in the process. It probably pissed him off, and now he's back.
this man has eluded the authorities for years.
how did you find him so fast?
a psychic hunch.
if you never recovered the body, why did you close the case?
what are you trying to say? He's saying if we hadn't screwed up, he'd be dead or in prison, and we wouldn't be doing this. Isn't that right?
I think you've become too involved in this case.
I think you should go home and get some rest. Let us do our job.
my wife is out there with that sick bastard, all right?
you want me to go home and take a nap?
I won't hesitate to lock you out of the investigation. You know I can do it.
so take a few hours and chill.
you're not going to go home now, are you?
no, I am not, but I do have an idea.
come on.
I thought you went through this place after it burned?
we did.
so, what do you expect to find this time?
Oh, not me, you.
we came right to here, and then we separated.
I went left, and you went right.
you went ahead without me, and I walked toward the kitchen...
that's where the fire started.
this is the last place we saw him.
and Linda.
we can just go, together.
nobody's going anywhere. - Walt, put the gun down.
I've got a half-dozen cruisers on their way up the hill right now.
you can arrest me and watch your friend die, or you can step aside. It's your choice.
Walt, listen to me. You need to let this one go.
I've seen it before.
all right.
fine. Then we all just relax.
take it easy.
is it worth it, Linda?
you don't understand.
his face was badly burned, and his arm, too.
what happened after that?
I let them go.
the factory's full of chemicals. We have to find erika.
I know where she is. She's underneath us. Follow me.
don't stop. I won't let you die!
I won't let you die...
when we took off to save the girl, the collector and Linda slipped out the side exit.
they drove away in a black S. U.V. I saw part of the plate.
it said w-r-4.
all right, let's go find the bastard.
thanks a lot.
there was a black '97 ford bronco matching that partial plate description registered to a Landmount properties.
probably a dummy corporation. - Was there an address?
P.O.Box. It gets even better. The deserted car they found?
it was abandoned three months ago. - Where?
about two hours north of here, a place called Shawnee Peak.
can you believe it? The guy's been in our backyard the whole time.
you going to talk to agent Gribbins? - So he can tell us to go home?
I mean, let's face it, to him, Sarah's nothing but another case number.
all right, well, let's go find him.
there's no way anyone could have survived that kind of trauma without medical attention.
according to them there hasn't been a major burn victim admitted here in over a year.
you feel better now?
Yeah.
if the guy was hurt, and Linda didn't take him to the hospital, that means she took care of him herself.
Yeah, and?
well, she'd need medical supplies, right?
it's against the law for me to sell to the public.
so you don't remember a woman asking for medical supplies?
something to treat a burn, huh?
I told you, I'd lose my license. - Well, maybe you could check your records.
like I said, it's-- - yeah, I know. I heard you the first time.
I'll get it. - No!
I'm expecting an important call.
now, if you gentlemen will excuse me, I have a business to run.
stack those boxes straight! What are you, blind?
four hours, we're back to ground zero.
we're never going to find her at this pace.
sheriff?
Hi.
um, I heard you talking to my boss. He's lying.
he wasn't telling the truth about selling supplies to the public.
well, go on.
I've seen a lot of supplies go out the back door, stuff that never shows up on any invoices or tax statements.
do you remember a woman coming in here about 11 months ago?
late 30s, blonde, pretty?
Oh, right, yeah. I remember her.
she wanted a lot of stuff in bulk.
um, gauze, antibiotics, and cyanocrylite.
Cyano--what? - Cyanocrylite?
it's a glue solvent. They use it for keeping skin tissue connected after a really bad burn.
she paid 10 times retail, too, in cash.
you sure about this? - Yeah, I'm sure.
I delivered it myself.
what, you have an address? - I can tell you where it is.
take this. - Why?
you've seen what this guy's capable of. Come on, let's go.
police, put your hands on your head!
put your hands on your head!
Jesus Christ...
it's empty.
if he's dead, who took Sarah?
there, there, now.
everything's going to be okay.
you'll see.
please don't do this.
Where's my son?
please don't hurt my son.
what do you want?
see?
what they did to him?
to everything that I cared about?
Yeah, well, now it's my turn.
I'll show them the meaning of love.
time to sleep now.
no, please don't
just shh... this won't hurt.
no, it's not me, okay? It's for my baby.
please... I just found out today.
my husband doesn't even know yet. Please.
I'll do whatever you want. I promise I won't struggle. Just...
just don't hurt my baby.
get up.
it's Linda, Walt.
she's the one who took Sarah.
what? What else?
nothing.
no, tell me what you saw, John.
look, man, I've got the right to know, okay?
Sarah's pregnant, Walt.
pregnant?
Yeah, she just found out today.
whoa, she'S... she's going to have a baby.
that's why we have to stay focused. All right?
right. Right.
thanks for coming in so early, Mark.
no, it's not a problem. You know how much we all care about Sarah.
what did you find, doctor?
well, the body has third-degree burns to the face and chest area.
the right arm is nearly burnt off at the shoulder.
so he died from fire?
no, infection, and the pain must have been incredible.
good.
how long's he been dead?
it's hard to tell without more extensive testing, but I'd guess the better part of a year, maybe nine, 10 months.
the solvent seems to have slowed the rate of decomposition.
no, it's obvious whoever preserved this body did it with tremendous care.
thank you, doctor.
Thanks, Mark.
what?
I could have your badge for interfering in a federal investigation.
since when is capturing a felon considered interference?
here's the deal.
you want to work on this case, we work as a team.
otherwise, I lock your ass up, and you read about it in the paper.
that's the offer, and it's non-negotiable.
sun comes up in two hours.
I've got 15 agents coming down from Washington. They'll be here by 8: 00.
in the meantime, I suggest go home, take a shower, grab some chow, try to get a couple hours of sleep.
once we get started, there'll be no time for that.
