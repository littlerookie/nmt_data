I know.
what - what can I do?
well, this party would be a good place to start.
Yeah, I - I - I thought that, but Jenny is just really set on something more simple.
any 16-year-old girl would love the kind of party that you should be throwing adult, elegant, the right notables in attendance.
and you saw the way that she looked at that dress.
she loves it. She wants a party like this.
she just needs someone to hold her hand a little.
so... what do you think?
we like that one better.
okay. I guess - I guess I'll just try it on.
see? She loves it.
that's all the proof you need.
you know, it's not too late.
why don't you start making some phone calls?
it's Serena Vander Woodson.
um, I know my mom might have called you this morning, but there's been a mistake.
the party's not canceled.
it's - it's still on, and actually, it's--it's gonna be bigger.
thanks for meeting me.
it's really good to see you.
I have a feeling you're not gonna like what I have to say.
Hey, don't act surprised, V.
you saw this coming. I mean, you left first.
I know, but... I mean, I'm sure we can do something to figure it all out, if we tried.
okay.
well, at least we can end things honestly, right?
right.
because if there is someone else, you could tell me.
probably make things easier.
this is about you and me.
no one else.
Really? - Yeah, really.
it's 10: 30, Dorota.
what took him so long?
maybe girl from Brooklyn cry.
Mr. Nate nice boy. He wipe tears.
he touch her hair. She touch his.
not that this ever happened to me.
it's done.
don't look too happy.
Oh, right. Sorry.
was it awful?
no.
things had some to a natural end, so... and it had nothing to do with anyone else.
of course.
it was just about you guys.
Hey, listen. It's, um, it's getting late, and I've had a really tough day.
so how about tomorrow, okay?
we could hang out this weekend.
pour that dom down the drain, Dorota.
wait. Is that the '96?
what happened, Miss Blair?
he kissed me on the forehead, like chevalier kissed gigi...
like he was a man, and I was a little girl.
no passion, no spark.
maybe Chuck was right.
maybe all Nate and I have together is just... history.
poor B.
it's hard to turn up the heat with an old flame.
but stand back.
someone's about to add fuel to this fire.
I have to say, I was a little surprised when you called.
that he dumped me, I can accept, but then he had the nerve to say that there was nothing between him and Blair.
the "just friends" speech?
I got it, too.
they're making fools of us.
well, not anymore.
you got a lot of board games there.
uh, you know, the day party. It's not a bomb shelter.
Yeah, well, I want to have options.
uh, do you know if Vanessa's coming?
Yeah. Yeah, she and Nate broke up last night.
it seems like she's taking it pretty hard, but, uh, she wants to come to the party, said she'd call.
okay.
Oh, and that's probably her.
Hello?
Mr. Humphrey? It's Gail from Brooklyn realty.
I wanted to schedule a time for our appraiser to come out to your loft.
is this a bad time?
uh, yeah.
you know, I'll call you later.
not Vanessa?
no. You know, we should probably start getting ready.
okay.
wait. Back up, Blair.
Nate and Vanessa broke up?
Oh, they had a falling-out after the Vander Bilt party, hadn't spoken for a week and broke up last night.
how do you know all this?
have you dumped me for Vanessa?
no.
I've just been spending a lot of time with Nate.
where is this coming from?
what? - You and Nate?
after all that you've been through?
you sure it's not just because Nate's not Chuck?
I thought Chuck was my future, Nate a part of my juvenile past, but now I'm thinking Chuck was just something I had to get out of my system rIder to realize Nate was my destiny all along.
well, if that's really how you feel, then I'm happy for you.
it's not exactly like I was rooting for Chuck, and Nate is good for you.
no drama.
Nate and I have plenty of drama and sparks and fireworks.
Uh-huh. When are you getting to my party?
you mean Jenny's party.
so do you have any idea what's going on out there?
B.I gotta go. I'm sorry.
Jenny's gonna love it.
Hey, Vanya.
guilty: Liberal 'victims' and their assault on America" by Ann Coulter?
Dorota gave to me.
she said important to know enemy.
it's okay. I read to make Dorota happy.
I have to say, I'm excited.
Oh, you should be.
dad only makes his chili on very special occasions.
well, not just about my birthday.
I mean, of course about my birthday, but, you know, Lily and dad and all of us together?
I don't know. Things just seem to be going really good.
Yeah. A little too good.
when? Since when is "good" too good?
uh, y-you know that phone call that wasn't Vanessa?
it was a real estate agent.
I think dad might be selling the loft.
what?
no. Where would we live?
well, I'd be at college.
I guess you and dad would be...
moving on up to the east side, to a deluxe apartment in the sky-y-y.
okay, yeah, yeah, funny.
first of all, you need to stop watching so many old sitcoms on Hulu, and second, dad on the upper east side? I mean, there's no way.
no, we can't live up here. We're... - Humphreys.
damn straight.
we grew up good. You know that?
Yeah.
okay.
it looks familiar and yet... - not bad, little J.
what are you doing here?
once I heard Poppy Lifton was coming to your party, I canceled mine.
in the last 20 minutes, I've been hit on by two Bronfmans and a gay designer.
it was so worth it.
kudos on rising from the social grave.
speaking of graves, did something die in that pot?
it's cumin.
I liked my social grave.
I dug it myself, and I was happy to lie in it.
what's going on? Why are they here?
I don't know. This chili weighs a ton, though.
I need to find a cater.
Jenny, hey. I didn't see you come in.
how could you with all this fabulous going on?
well done. Happy birthday, Jenny.
poppy, I didn't expect to see you.
Hey, uh, will you get us some drinks? - sure.
well, surprised?
confused. I mean, what is all this?
Where's my dad and lily?
they're at "Billy Elliot," fifth row center.
I- I told them that a girl only turns 16 once, and she needs to spend it with her friends and friends of friends.
my present to you.
Serena, I didn't want this.
well, I thought you didn't want a social fiasco where - where you planned something and people didn't show up, but this is perfect.
I mean, Jenny, all of these people are here for you.
Patrick, hey.
uh, would you take a picture with me and the birthday girl?
sure.
it's a birthday?
excuse me.
enjoying my party?
you know, I was just saying to Jonathan that this is a lovely, intimate family gathering.
nothing says "Jenny Humphrey" like a customized cocktail napkin.
Eric, I don't get it. Why would Serena hijack my birthday?
well, I know she was trying to do something nice for you.
maybe she just got a little carried away.
and maybe she wanted to prove to everyone she could still throw a great party.
well... if she wants people to know what a great party she can throw, why not tell everyone?
I came to you because I noted to do something besides feel sorry for myself, but all it's been is sleazy platitudes and...
you staring at my boobs.
I came up with several excellent ideas.
you just shot most of them down.
Yeah, because they all involved leaking a Chuck / Vanessa sex tape to the internet.
we don't have to leak the tape if you don't want to.
consistent, if twisted.
why are they here?
what do we do?
what? No keg?
no, of course there's no keg!
Serena, who are these rowdy children?
I mean, I know Jenny's young, but this is embarrassing.
I know. I know. I'm so sorry.
um, just give me a minute, and - and I'll figure this out.
we're leaving. You should come with.
trust me, I would love to get out of here right now, but I think I should deal with the table dancers first.
I'll - I'll catch up with you later.
well, do try, for your own good.
Yeah.
Jenny. Jenny, please help me get rid of these party crashers.
um, they're not crashing, Serena. I invited them.
well, you have your guest list, and I have mine.
Yeah, but - but this can't be what you want.
like you care what I want.
Jenny, I genuinely thought that when you got off the elevator, you would be thrilled, and if you weren't, then I'm sorry, but you should have just said something.
Serena, I did, at breakfast, and you clearly......
Serena, um... - it's fine. Jenny and I are just having our first fight.
there are strangers having sex in your bed.
Oh, my god.
wait. Did you get that out of my mother's closet?
the word he used was, uh, uh,"haunting"a haunting sense of immediacy.
I love that.
Oh. Yeah, he's - he's a smart guy, my fan.
he's a good writer. - Dan, help.
well, I'm kind of in the middle of something.
well, I need you to be in the middle of something else.
Where'd your boyfriend go?
we're not a couple.
it's just physical.
I'll take your word for it.
but listen, whatever's going on between you two, just make sure Chuck doesn't talk you into doing something you regret.
whatever's going on with Chuck wasn't his idea.
it was mine, and least he doesn't pretend to be one thing, when really he's another.
you said there was no one else.
there's not.
blair's my friend. Nothing's happened between us.
well, not yet.
but he's telling you the truth.
Nate's a good guy.
if you'd have seen that, maybe you'd still be together.
now that he's free, who knows what will happen?
exactly. We don't know.
we're just hanging out.
sure, that's what people do at parties, hang out.
but later, when we're alone - Blair... we'll talk about it.
what is there to talk about?
okay, do you guys want to have this conversation somewhere else, alone?
why are you still standing here?
Blair, what are we doing in here?
you're not leaving this room until we find out once and for all if we're really just friends.
well, don't just stare at me. Do something.
Blair, stop acting like me being your friend is some kind of plot to humiliate you, okay?
did you ever think that maybe things didn't work out between us because we weren't friends?
you're right, Nate.
this week, you've become my friend.
it's amazing, and I've never wanted to kiss my friend so much in my life.
we're at a party full of people in Chuck's room, and he and Vanessa are right behind the wall.
that doesn't excite you?
don't.
only my boyfriend gets to touch my hair.
they have been in there for a while.
what if all we did is push 'em closer together?
you just need to relax and trust in the power of our overwhelming sexual chemistry to drive a wedge between them.
go intercept him.
it looks like that went well.
you wanted to be more like Blair Waldorf?
well, congratulations. You succeeded.
poor V.
nobody gets what they want without losing something they love, like their integrity.
stains.
gross!
I can't believe Jenny would turn a sophisticated soiree into a teenage rager.
well, you did turn her abble and sloppy joe party into a sophisticated soiree, so...
you know, not that the punishment exactly fits the crime.
well, maybe on some entirely subconscious level, I was thinking of myself.
well, yes, it - it may have been somewhat conscious, but I don't know.
my - my life has just felt so normal lately.
getting back together with you and breaking up again, fighting with Blair and then not......
it just - it all felt so high school.
well, we are in high school, at least for a little while longer.
old people seem oddly nostalgic for this time in their lives.
is it gonna make me sound like my dad if iay that you have the rest of your life to throw these fabulous society parties, but this might be the last opportunity you have to roust naked strangers from making love on your mattress?
actually, you know, it sounds a lot like college.
Serena, we have a problem.
how was I supposed to know that if I threw you the best party of the year, you would sabotage it?
how was I supposed to know how many kids would show up?
parasites! Hooligans!
get!
Vanya, what's going on?
worse than the rats, with their cell phones over and over.
it's too much.
go home! Away, before I - call the cops.
Politzia.
well, at least they scared everyone away.
Hi, kids.
we're home.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
okay, Lil, deep breath.
things definitely got out of hand, but the most important thing is that the kids are okay.
Yes, well, that may be the most important thing, but the second most important thing is the apartment the furniture, the - the rugs, the art, the--my closet.
I thought I recognized that dress.
Serena, how did this happen?
mom, I admit I made a few phone calls.
if you want to punish someone for the passed hors d'oeuvres, point the finger here.
guilty as charged.
but as far as all the people...
Oh, and you expect me to believe that Jenny was behind this?
after she had me cancel the best caterer in town because she wanted clue and a crock-pot.
don't you dare leave me here to clean up this mess, Serena.
when this family was just me and Eric, if things got out of control, it was a pretty safe bet that it was my fault.
that's true.
but as this family grows, so does the pool of suspects.
this is not my mess.
okay, so whose mess is it?
I mean, all I did was carry the chili and prevent teenagers from having unprotected sex.
Serena may have had her own motives and I may have helped with the crowd situation with a few inspirational words, but, um...
but I was the one who posted the party on "gossip girl."
look, I'm sorry, Lily, and I'm sorry, dad.
and I don't know. Maybe Serena was just trying to be nice, but the party that she threw was totally embarrassing.
Jenny, I don't understand.
um, it sounds to me like what Serena put together was... delightful.
you know, at least last year, it was my face on the cake.
and the people at my party might have hated me, but at least they knew who I was.
I know that it's hard for you guys to understand , but I like being me, and as crazy as it may seem,
I choose not to be a Park Avenue princess on my birthday or any other day, no matter what my address might be.
what are you talking about, Jenny?
the real estate agent called today.
dad, you and Lily might want to live together, but I'm just not ready to stop being a Humphrey.
wait. Live together?
teenage ragers, annoying sort of siblings, being yelled at by my mother......
this should not be my life.
it doesn't have to be, sweetie.
I mean, so what if your stock took a dip in the last quarter?
whose didn't?
but that doesn't mean you can't still turn things around.
well, then what do you suggest?
and don't say to host another party.
no.
uh, well, it sounds to me like you need to get away.
Yes. Yes! Road trip.
no. I was thinking more like a private jet to Spain.
Yeah.
mm, see, even my fantasies are becoming dull.
listen, Gabriel's parents' place is insanely beautiful, and the weather and the food and Gabriel's hot friends.
when do we leave?
tomorrow morning.
tomorrow?
I... I'm embarrassed to say this, but I-I think I might be grounded.
Serena... no.
I know. Yeah, I mean, you're right.
Yeah, let's go to Spain.
to Espa! - To Espa!
Uh-oh, looks like someone's up to their old tricks, and just in time, too.
Cuidado, Espa.
here comes el problema.
I can't tell if it's chili in my pot or if some kid threw up in here.
just gratefulIy could stay here last night and wait it out while an army of highly trained professionals restores our home.
did you ever hear from Serena?
Yeah, she left a message saying she was sleeping at Poppy's.
Oh, I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions, been so hard on her.
and Jenny should have spoken up sooner.
Lil, I'm really sorry.
and so is she. I know.
I just think we might be moving a bit fast. - So about moving in together...
I love the idea of our family sharing a place together.
one day.
it's gonna be complicated, to say the least.
we need to find our way and the kids need to find theirs.
we shouldn't let circumstance impose a time line.
I agree.
but what are you gonna do about Dan and Yale?
we'll figure something out.
figure out what?
what do we need to figure t between me and Yale?
I'm gonna go get dressed.
wait. Is that - is that why you were moving in with Lily?
to pay for my education?
uh... What - what happened?
Yale has great financial aid.
well, as of now, we're a low priority.
it's all determined by need.
and I'm - I'm - we're not needy enough?
it's all relative, Dan.
well, what do we do?
well, I've never let money get in the way of your education before. I'm not gonna start now.
we've got some time.
and you need to stay positive about your future.
did you call that kid who sent you a fan letter I bet he's dying to hear back from you.
Yeah, well, I mean, it was great of him to reach out like that, so I'll give him a call.
we'll figure out a way.
Oh, I - I know.
I should have known it was too good to last.
it's just-- I was having so much fun hanging out with a normal guy like Nate.
we may not have had the drama or the electricity, but you know what we did have?
fun?
Yes, Dorota, fun.
Nate - he's so nice.
being around him wasn't hard.
it didn't hurt... until now.
I miss my friend Nate.
maybe you get happy soon.
true.
the ducks do soothe me.
give me my loaf.
Mr. Nate called to ask where your favorite spot - that be where he want first kiss.
is it true that you brought me here?
well, you ran off too quickly last night, all I want to tell you is that I do want to be with you...
just not like that.
excuse me.
do I know you?
uh, don't think so, no.
I met you last year, around this time, actually.
you were with a friend of yours, and you were calling yourself Savannah.
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
I got refreshments for the ride.
Yeah.
did you two introduce yourselves?
uh, not exactly.
it's Serena.
I figured.
well, it's nice to meet you again.
I'm Gabriel.
Oh, my god. We're gonna have so much fun.
hold this. I gotta get my coat.
your phone!
who does, uh, Scott know in Brooklyn?
no one.
Hello?
is this Scott?
I'm sorry. Scott can't come to the phone right now.
can I give him a message?
Yeah, this is Daniel Humphrey.
he wrote me a letter, so, uh, I guess if he wants to talk, tell him he can - he can give me a call back.
certainly. I'll pass the message along.
okay. Thank you.
so who was it?
Scott wrote a letter to Rufus Humphrey's son.
why would he - he knows.
how do you delete an incoming call?
mistakes - we all make them.
they usually start with the best of intentions, like keeping a secret to protect someone...
ready? - I'll be just a second.
or getting some distance from the person you've become.
sometimes we don't even know what mistakes we've made to get us where we are.
or we figure it out just in time to make it right again.
to teach you a lesson you would otherwise never learn...
you were going to leave without saying good-bye.
I knew you more like me than you were letting on.
Chuck, it's morning now, as in "cold light of," as in" let's pretend last night didn't happen.
we could just as easily pretend that this didn't happen, too.
and hopefully you never make that mistake again.
so we're clear?
this is just between us.
it means nothing.
what means nothing?
lucky for me, that never happens.
X. O. X. O. Gossip girl.
gossip girl here... your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
why settle for some club in a hotel when you can just buy the hotel? - I'm worrying.
politics is a Van Der Bilt birthright.
the only thing Nate's ever voted for is "American Idol."
Tripp was the same way.
grandfather can be very persuasive.
when did Tripp decide to run for Congress?
well, after congressman Kruger died, a house seat opened up in Manhattan.
Dan, I have to tell you something.
Oh, Olivia! - Oh, my God. Are you... you're not...
Fleur, I lied because I... I care about you.
the only person I want to kiss here tonight is you.
why would you leak a fake photo?
are you trying to destroy Tripp's campaign?
that's gonna win Tripp the election.
and what happens to Carter? - I am sorry I had to lie to you.
no, you're not. I settled your debt with the Buckleys.
Nate probably hates me now, but it doesn't matter.
I'm sorry, S. But Chuck's hotel needed this.
without your celebrities, we're buried in the city section.
now we're front page news.
you got my clients photographed at the hottest party of the year. Your job is safe. And, Serena, that job now includes publicly dating Patrick.
I don't know if I'd call that work.
get back to me after date two.
and who am I?
that's a secret I'll never tell.
you know you love me.
X. O.X. O. Gossip Girl.
in Manhattan, some parties are V.I.P. Only.
others are strictly private.
but some parties are political.
and those lines are drawn by the most established of the Establishment.
Hey. You want to use that?
and once those lines are drawn, they can never be crossed.
a Michael Mann political thriller?
that's good news. - Wonderful news.
and my source tells me.
Michael's only considering two actors for the lead.
Patrick and Ryan Phillippe.
well, then he's in. Ryan totally lost his mojo. After Reese got with Jake. - Don't "Jake" me, Serena.
this is serious.
your job is to get Patrick's photo taken with politicians, at the Van Ver Bilt election party tonight. - But, K. C. I can't.
the producers will eat it up. Plus, it'll totally help him get into character for his audition next week.
so I look forward to hearing how it goes. - Wait, K. C. the problem is I'm...
I'm kind of on the outs with the Van Ver Bilts right now.
Serena, what's P.R. Rule number one?
my only value is my social network.
but I'm afraid that network is currently one archibald short. - Make it happen.
clean up your mess or clean out your desk. No, that one.
Ahh.
Hey!
Hey. How long you been awake?
Mm. Not long.
remind me to send the Van Der Bilt campaign a muffin basket. Vanessa's been completely M. I.A.
since she started shooting that documentary.
she was here for, like, ten seconds yesterday, and I guess she's getting amazing footage.
the only footage I want to see is your Jimmy Fallon appearance.
I mean, dinner was great last night.
I just wish we'd gotten back in time to see it.
Yeah. Sorry I... I dragged you to that Gelato shop.
I had a really bad sugar craving.
you know what? I bet it's online.
no. Uh, you can't watch it like that.
th-the... the quality's so bad, you know?
I'd rather you watch it in H. D. - Okay. When? I'm sorry.
I'm just excited. It's been a while since I had a girlfriend on a late night talk show.
um, well, I'm... I'm sure I can get a copy from K. C.
okay.
ho ho! Watch out.
it's bathroom boy.
clear the way.
uh, good morning to you, too.
welcome to my new suite. We may patent the media system...
interactive, high-def 3D gaming, instant access to the world's largest media library and all in-house food, SPA services.
just touch the button.
blair's favorite part...
real-time surveillance playback.
it's naughty.
well, it certainly is a step up from the Columbia dorms.
most penthouses are, Nathaniel.
there's two bedrooms.
feel free to crash any time you like.
Tripp Maureen. - Hey, Chuck.
Hey. All this behind-the-scenes stuff is really great.
thanks again for letting me film Tripp's campaign.
Oh, no problem.
Charles. Well, you've outdone yourself. - My pleasure, sir.
I can't think of a better way to christen the ballroom than with a Van Der Bilt victory party.
your generosity will not be forgotten by me or my family.
we're very much looking forward to tonight's event.
thanks again, Chuck. Even if the night ends in defeat. - At least we'll have a good party. - Sweetie... Don't talk like that.
this morning's polling numbers aren't great.
we're down where we should be up, and where we are up. We're barely hanging on. - That's what makes it exciting, right?
excuse me. - He's right, Nathaniel.
things aren't where they should be.
the Buckleys' dirty pool is starting to work.
thanks to Serena, we weren't able to expose it.
well, isn't there something we can do?
it's election day. At this point, Nathaniel, it would take nothing short of a miracle.
Hey. I was running errands, and K. C asked me to drop off your Jimmy Fallon interview.
great. I guess that means you've seen it.
Yeah.
you know I didn't mean what I said.
Oh, don't... don't worry about that.
I'm sure Dan understands. - He hasn't even seen it.
I don't know what to do. I have to fix this, and meanwhile, keep him away from TV and the internet and strangers with the urge to make fun of him.
don't forget about Gossip Girl.
I have to just keep him completely isolated.
Oh, hey. What are you doing here?
um... - Serena just, uh, came by - to tell us how much she likes Patrick. - Oh.
Yeah. Uh, oddly, he's my favorite part of my job.
it's actually pretty fun having a fake relationship.
talk about no pressure. - I'm slightly relieved.
I heard some pretty crazy stuff about Patrick after we broke up.
supposedly he went a bit method after that Gus Van Sant movie "He Did Nobody Saw."
Yeah. His... his agents and K. C. are filtering all the scripts that get to him.
so far, he's only been allowed to read a political thriller.
what's the worst thing he can do, pass a bill?
listen, as much as I enjoy my current girlfriend talking to my ex-girlfriend about her fake boyfriend who is also my current girlfriend's ex, uh, you... you... you could probably get us a copy of that Fallon interview, right? - But first, um, Serena, you should probably get to Patrick's, before Fedex does with more scripts. - Good-bye.
okay. - Bye.
s. I hope you're not here looking for an apology.
no, I was just dropping something off to Olivia.
Oh, that's right. I momentarily forgot your job is more important than your friends.
I have a couple minutes. Do you want to get a latte?
if by "getting a latte" you mean apologizing, then no, I don't.
out of respect for our many years of friendship, - I'm willing to let what you did slide. - What I did?
okay, we both made decisions that hurt the other.
we both feel badly. Now let's move on.
I actually have to go meet Chuck right now.
we've been going nonstop, prepping for Tripp Van Der Bilt's election party tonight.
speaking of which, I noticed you're not on the guest list.
that can only mean one thing... Nate still hates you - for whatever it is you did to him. - I'd check your sources, B.
and I am going tonight, with my handsome boyfriend, Patrick.
since your boyfriend's working the party.
who are you going with, one of your knockoffs?
since you're so interested, I have made real friends here.
I just don't share your need to brag.
okay.
well, I can't wait to meet them tonight.
I need a friend. Stat.
I'm your friend.
please.
I'm not friends with staff.
you need to get that?
no, it's not important.
this is Nate. Leave a message.
I'm just saying, if this morning's polls put you neck and neck with Sullivan, then there's still time, so why not let grandfather help you?
Nate, I've said it before, and I'll say it again...
I'd rather lose fair and square than win with a dirty campaign.
Yeah, well, asking grandfather for help doesn't necessarily mean playing dirty.
so it's election day. Who are you voting for?
Hey! Someone's drowning over here! Call 9-1-1!
help! I can't swim!
help! I'm drowning!
it look like Tripp's prayers have been answered with another miracle on the Hudson.
are the Van Der Bild's bless with good luck or good timing?
you're watching New York 1 "News All Day."
just this morning,
congressional candidate Tripp Van Der Bilt rescued a man who was drowning in the Hudson river.
one minute I'm walking along the pier, and the next thing I know I lose my balance.
and boom! I'm in the Hudson. If it wasn't for this brave young man, - Tripp Van Der Bilt... - Apparently Van Der Bilt was on his way to his...
ten hours till the polls close. Let's seize the day, gentlemen.
where are we with media?
I've locked down coverage from every local station for the midday news. Time to call Couric. She owes me a favor.
maybe she can squeeze Tripp into the evening news.
excuse me, grandfather.
can I speak with you for a moment? - Zogby has them neck and neck.
rasmussen puts him up by a point. - Tripp, that's fantastic.
remember, until the polls close, any time someone mentions the name Tripp Van Der Bilt, it should be followed by the word "hero."
well, I guess miracles do happen, huh, grandfather?
our family is really blessed.
so is that man who almost died.
William, can you take a look at this?
Absolutely. No, thank you. Thank you so, so much.
Hey. My rescue footage is gonna be on the news tonight.
william told me to go out and drum up some interest, and it looks like I'm the only one who got it all on tape.
Congratulations. Have you seen Nate?
Yeah. He's over there. Tell him bye for me.
I've gotta go home and get my tapes together. - Okay.
what are you doing here? - I... I left you a message. Y... you never called me back.
Yeah, well, as you can see, I've been sort of busy.
and I really have nothing to say to you.
then I'll make it quick. I need you to put me and Patrick Roberts on the guest list for Tripp's party tonight.
what? Are you kidding me?
Nate, my job is at stake. - Oh, that's funny.
so is my cousin's campaign, thanks to you.
as far as I'm concerned, we're even.
you used me for your Buckley photo scam.
all I did was find out and undo it.
well, I wouldn't exactly call revenge a solid foundation for a friendship.
who said anything about friendship?
all I need is an invite, plus one.
Tripp, hey. I... I voted for you.
Thanks. You coming tonight?
Absolutely. I wouldn't miss it.
Thanks, Nate.
Tripp, can I get you to sign off on this?
washington Square Park, Bobst Library, bar none.
I even tried spinning the cube in St. Mark's place, but not a friend in sight.
I just know this wouldn't be so hard at Yale.
what about that Vanessa girl?
didn't you know her in high school?
I have never heard that name before in my life.
now feel free to see yourself out.
Oh, my god.
how does that girl have the Valentino 360 bag?
I'm still wait-listed. - Who? Where?
at the register.
quick. How do I look?
superior.
no one follow me.
I love your 360.
Thanks. I just got it. - Very smart to pair it with Peter Som.
you're good.
I know. I'm Blair. May I?
Oh, please. Do.
the moment I saw it, it joined my list of Blair's most wanted.
believe me when I tell you I don't say this very often, but I think I like you.
well, give me those peep toes and maybe I'll believe you.
sorry. My Alexandre Birmans are sacred.
Amen.
by the way, I'm Brandeis.
how would you like to come with me to a fabulous party tonight?
mat, are you joking? - Oh, not in the least. It's going on the end of "door," which makes it a triple word score, scrabble bitches.
that's my son. - Wow. The Humphreys are... are so serious - about their scrabble games. - Oh, yeah.
you two are so sweet to come over and entertain Jenny.
poor thing. - Well, she's been cooped up with this virus for a week.
I mean, when she called, how could we resist?
Yeah. Th...thank you guys so much.
really getting sick of, uh, TV and internet.
Oh, I need a S.A.R.S. Mask. - Um, can I... can I borrow your phone?
Yeah, go ahead. - I keep leaving mine in the dorm.
that's 33.
a whopping 33 points.
"Jetdoorman..." is that a word?
don't you mean "jetdoormat"?
Oh, jetdoormat. - S.A.R.S. Mask!
so it's election day. Who are you voting for?
I don't know. That's a really tough question.
you know, I'm not really sure who I'm gonna vote for. He's awfully young.
you know, I'm not really...
what?
... Sure who I'm gonna vote for. He's awfully young.
Wow. You look hot.
same. I have great news.
Yeah. So do I. - You first.
I just finished reading a fantastic script.
the Political Thriller? - No, it's a remake of "Leaving Las Vegas."
they want to redo it with a younger cast.
where did you get those scripts?
in the garbage. I'm telling you, this one's amazing.
care to join me in a little research? - No. No research.
your team has been pushing very hard for the political one.
and I have worked my butt off to get you into this party tonight.
Yeah, but Miley Cyrus is already signed on to play the Elisabeth Shue role.
they must've seen her on that pole at the T.C.A.S.
okay, we don't have time to talk about this.
you need to get ready.
this party is a very big deal for both of us.
there will be tons of important political people there tonight.
forget Vegas. It's all about D. C. okay?
put on some clothes, please.
Hey, Vanessa.
listen, I'm really busy. Uh, this couldn't wait?
honestly, no.
and I thought it'd be better to talk away from the campaign chaos.
Mm. I'm in a really awkward position, - so I'm just gonna say what I have to say. - Okay.
what happened at the Hudson this morning wasn't what it looked like.
what do you mean?
the guy you and Tripp saved...
he didn't fall.
I think it... I think it was set up.
that's ridiculous.
I have it all on tape.
well, has anyone else seen the footage?
no, but I...I already agreed to sell it to New York 1, and I'm going to meet Caroline Lowe, one of the producers, at cafeteria.
whoa. Wait. Vanessa, if you do that, then... - Nate, I'm sorry, but if I just sit on it, I become part of a cover-up.
listen, the polls close in a few hours.
can you just... can you just wait? - I wish I could, but this is not some high school thing with Blair and the mean girls.
this is someone running for public office, Nate.
Yeah, but there's gotta be some sort of an explanation.
someone set Tripp up to look like a hero, and I think we both know the person most likely to orchestrate something like that is your grandfather.
I have so much respect for Tripp, and he has been so generous to let me film his campaign.
should I warn him so he can prepare a strategy for damage control? - Don't worry about telling Tripp.
okay? I'll tell him.
I'm sorry, Nate.
no.
this election may be too close to call.
but when it's his family's honor or his own,
Nate Archibald has the number on speed dial.
Yes, uh, New York 1, please.
Wow. Thank you so much for explaining that.
Hey, we were just discussing the Senate Committee on appropriations.
maybe you'd like to join us. - Oh, my God. Hello.
thank you so much.
see? Isn't this great?
you've got the... the perfect Capital Hill vibe.
I gotta hit the can.
okay.
he's great. - Do you wanna...
Oh, my God. That's Senator Proctor.
Wow. You really do know everyone.
Oh, I don't know everyone. I'll be right back.
Hey, Blair. - Hey. Do you see that gorgeous blonde in Proenza Schouler talking to those high-profile politicians?
that's my best friend Brandeis.
she knows most of them personally.
Oh, that's great. I mean, political connections aren't the first thing most people look for in friends.
they must really love her.
because when she introduced us, they seemed thrilled to meet me.
they even asked if we were sisters.
well, I can't wait for you to meet Patrick.
he's over at the bar, getting me a drink right now.
I feel so lucky. He's so attentive. - It doesn't take much, does it?
what? No one's ever accused you of saying no.
Hey, where is the scrabble dictionary?
I could swear "squiffy"'s a word.
Oh.
Scrabble dictionary.
bathroom boy?
all right, you know our next guest from the "Endless Knights" movie franchise...
please welcome the lovely Olivia Burke, everybody!
she's cute.
...Served four years on city council and ten in the State Legislature.
stumping for him all across rural Upstate New York he was a supporter of John Mccain, in the 2008 presidential race.
someone just told me you're Vanessa Abrams. Is that right?
Yeah. - So who did you end up selling the footage to?
my office just called, said that you sold your rescue footage to another network.
Yeah, I sold it to New York 1, actually a woman named Caroline Lowe.
I met her two hours ago.
I'm Caroline Lowe.
so who was the woman in the restaurant?
finally. It's your turn.
Oh, you know what? I just realized I have an, uh, environmental studies paper due tomorrow.
Oh, wait. Um, I'll just get my stuff.
no, you know what? Stay. You're winning.
and you gotta keep Jenny company.
I'll text you later, okay? - Did my son just walk out before playing a "q" on a double letter?
that is so not the Humphrey way.
my computer.
hmm. - Hmm.
you know, I am sensing something else is going on here.
well, you didn't actually think they wanted to play five hours worth of board games with us, did you?
Mm.
uh, no. He's probably getting mobbed by fans right now.
he's... he's just still on the way to get us a drink. - Doubt it.
because he downed both your drinks and then ordered two more... for himself.
where is he? - Don't worry. I took care of it.
I had him taken up to his suite.
what? Why? - He's bombed.
he's drunker than Paula Abdul during Hollywood Week.
are you really that jealous that he's here with me?
look, S, you know wasted better than most of us, having been in that state so many times yourself.
I guess you just met your match.
but since I just found out that your date is really work, you may want to play closer attention to him next time.
this is Nate's big night at Chuck's hotel,
so sorry, S, I did what I had to do... Again.
so you're out with this guy, and he goes to the bathroom. - Yes.
he comes back... - Well, it was... it was our first date.
and he goes to the restroom and when he comes back, his... his shirt was on inside out. - Uh, uh, check, please.
no. - That's where you go right there.
that's when you get out. That's when you have to leave, yes. - Really?
no, I find out later that on the way into the bathroom, he's walked into a spiderweb, and the spider crawled inside his shirt. - Yeah, the old... the old spider excuse.
Yeah, we've all used that one before.
Yeah, the old "oh, a spider came down on my shirt, and that's why I had to take my shirt off and..."
okay, that... Yeah, I believe that.
Yeah, I would believe that one.
and... and now are you still dating bathroom boy or... - Jimmy.
or are... was he arrested?
I don't know. - You know what? Tomorrow is our 1-month anniversary.
Aw! Oh, oh, my Gosh. Well, congratulations.
Yeah. Yeah, it's big. - In... in honor... in honor, I'll be taking my clothes off in the bathroom and then redressing myself.
Wow. And after all that scrabble...
I can't believe I told that story on National Television.
he must hate me.
please pick up. Please pick up. Please pick up.
it went to voice mail.
Hey. Um, it's me.
I know that you're not picking up because you must be so mad at me.
please know that I'm so, so sorry.
Patrick. What are you doing? - Whoa!
I told you how important tonight was.
Serena, what? Oh.
you think Blair had me thrown out because I was a little tipsy or because I was talking to that high-priced call girl friend of hers?
what did you just say?
why'd you do it?
do what? - Come on, Nate. You're the only one who knew I had a meeting to sell that footage. - I had to protect Tripp.
I came to you first, as a friend.
don't be so self-righteous.
you were only selling the footage to further your own career. - That is not true.
Oh, so you're saying you weren't excited to see your name flash on every television in Manhattan?
you know what, Nate? I'll let you know how that feels in just a minute. - What does that mean?
Hey. Hey, everybody, quiet down for a second.
...with breaking news.
we are just now getting reports that firsthand footage of the Hudson River rescue reveals Tripp Van Der Bilt's heroic act might not have been so heroic.
it seems after close inspection of the footage taken at the time, it's apparent the man deliberately went into the Hudson river...
the polls are closed, and gossip girls call this selection... dirty.
it remains to be seen who exactly is responsible for this hoax.
someone in the Van Der Bilt camp?
maybe the candidate himself?
but news of this breaking... - Grandfather.
...Effect it'll have on the polls is impossible to measure.
all right, could someone just turn that off?
and, please, just give us a moment of privacy. Thank you.
I can't believe you would compromise my integrity like this.
take a deep breath, Tripp.
you didn't believe I could actually win, did you?
honestly, I had my doubts.
but I did not do this.
the hell you didn't. - Tripp, just calm down.
listen to me very carefully, grandfather.
if you don't go out there and take responsibility for this, then I will...
by stepping out of the race.
I'm not gonna go stand in front of those cameras and lie.
Oh, come on, grandfather. It's time to come clean.
I give you my word. I'm not responsible for this.
unfortunately for the both of us, your word means nothing anymore.
well, if you are both done,
I'm going to go down and join the celebration.
gather the press, Nate.
I'm going to announce my official withdrawal.
I just have to tell Maureen first.
I know I'm an enemy of the state right now.
the guy I used to call my friend had a moral compass.
well, right now I'm thinking I'm just gonna go for my master's, but who knows?
sorry to interrupt. Brandeis, right? I'm Serena.
Hi, Serena. This is Congressman Wade.
pleasure to meet you.
and are you a, uh, student, like Brandeis?
no, I'm just a regular old working girl.
Really? And... and do you two work together?
because maybe the three of us...
uh, congressman, you've been campaigning a little too hard.
let me guess... you want to go upstairs and see if two blondes make a right? - Uh, excuse us.
I'm sorry.
I thought I was working this party alone.
did the agency send you?
no, you're right. This party is all yours.
excuse me.
as a friend of the family, what do you have to say about the allegation that Tripp Van Der Bilt's heroism might have been staged?
uh, I say I'm a businessman, not a politician.
fine, so how will it affect your business if the empire's inaugural event is mired in scandal?
look, you think anyone goes to the Mercer for the maid service?
they go 'cause they want to see Russell Crowe throw a hissy.
anyway, nothing happens at the Empire without my say-so.
what are you doing, Blair? Looking for your best friend?
bad news. Security just escorted her out in time to avoid a major political scandal.
you're kidding me. Now we're doing tit for tat?
she was an escort, a high-priced hooker.
you're ridiculous.
brandeis is not a call girl. She's a psych major.
who on earth told you that? - Patrick.
the guy is wasted. He thought Chuck Schumer was his father.
you're just trying to get back at me.
no, actually, I'm just looking out for Chuck and Nate.
I doubt Chuck would want a prostitute at his hotel. - Especially at this party. - You don't get it.
Patrick was about to cause a scene.
I was protecting everyone, including you.
what are you talking about?
look, ladies, please.
this is supposed to be a classy event, not a sample sale at an outlet mall.
Chuck, you'll never believe what Serena did.
she had my friend kicked out of the party. - The call girl?
security just told me.
W... no, no. I promise you, Brandeis is not an escort.
Serena's just trying to get even with me.
look, I don't know what's going on here, but if the girl's still here, I'll find her, and get to the bottom of it, okay? - Thank you, Chuck.
and who's the one getting paid to date her clients anyway?
that's enough, Blair.
no. If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck...
the only prostitute here... is you.
come on, Chuck.
I want some cake.
Blair and Serena at war again.
yummy.
Hey. Let me go first.
Nate, it's okay. I know what I'm doing.
excuse me.
excuse me.
Hi.
my name is Nate Archibald.
I'm Tripp Van Der Bilt's cousin.
and I know there's a lot of buzz going around about what exactly happened this morning at the Hudson river.
and it saddens me to tell you all that the story about it being a hoax...
it is true.
however, my cousin, Tripp Van Der Bilt, had no knowledge of any kind of setup.
my cousin is not only the most moral, honest and courageous guy I know...
he's still a hero.
and how do I know this?
because I'm the one who set it up.
what the hell is wrong with you? - Right now, thirst. I need a drink.
she called me a prostitute.
Yeah. Why do you think she did that? - I'm not sleeping with Patrick.
you, of all people, know what a prostitute does.
the reason Blair attacked you is because she misses you.
don't tell me after 18 years, you can't read Waldorf subtext.
I shouldn't have to.
if that's what she's feeling, then she should tell me.
it is time for her to grow up. - This coming from someone who just pushed their best friend into a cake.
look, you think your friendship is going to take care of itself.
you're not kids anymore. You can't say you hate each other then make up an hour later on the met steps.
you tell her that. - I'm telling you.
and you should be careful, because one day you're gonna find yourself telling people about Blair Waldorf, the girl who used to be your best friend.
Hi. I got your text.
Yeah. All it said was... - "maybe we should talk..."
and so I just came right away.
I'm sorry about Fallon.
up till now, my publicist would decide everything for me...
what I'd talk about during interviews and even script exactly what I would say.
and just this one time, I wanted to just... be myself and... and go out there and be me, and I... I bombed.
what? No, you didn't. No. No, it was funny, really.
and then today, you left, and I knew... I knew that I'd hurt you.
and our first date meant so much to me.
Olivia, Fallon was right.
the spider story isn't even true.
what is... what is this?
you want to know the truth about our... our first date?
there was no spider. I, uh, I... I was so nervous that I was with you, I kept sweating through my shirt, so I was running to the bathroom to use the hand dryer to...
what? This isn't funny. Don't laugh.
I'm not... I'm trying... I'm really trying not to.
and then today,
I rushed out of scrabble because I'd just seen your interview on TV, where you told the whole world that today was our 1-month anniversary, you know, and...
I mean, I'm... I'm usually very on the ball with these things.
stop. You're amazing.
and you're not the only one with a surprise today.
you're watching New York 1...
news all evening.
before we return to the race for the mayor of New York City, we first want to take you to the congressional election, which really couldn't be any closer.
at this time, with 85% of the votes counted,
Mike Sullivan has 49, 837 votes.
Hey.
what are you doing down here? Get back to your party.
I was hoping you'd still be here. I wanted to thank you for the sacrifice you made on that stage tonight, for me.
Hey, I was happy to, because I believe in you.
here it is. We are now prepared to call the election in favor - And apparently, New York does, too.
of newcomer 26-year-old William Van Der Bilt III, affectionately known to those around him as "Tripp."
that is right. With 96% of the votes counted... - I won.
Yeah, you did. Just do me one favor, though. - Anything.
be the best congressman this district's ever seen.
I have complete faith in you. And after all, I mean,
you're the only honest man in our family.
Congrats.
Thanks. - You deserve it.
I better get going before we're seen together, and another scandal erupts. - I promise you, one day I will make things right. I will fix this.
this is the beginning of a new Van Der Bilt dynasty, one we can be proud of.
Congratulations! I'm so proud of you!
stay away from me.
Blair, I'm sorry.
I... I shouldn't have done that.
but whether it was Patrick tonight or... or K. C.'s clients at Chuck's party, a real friend would have come to me with the problem, - and we would have solved it together. - Seriously, Serena?
after 18 years of this, I actually feel sorry for you.
you're so far deep in Serena world, you can't even recognize what's really going on.
throughout all my years with Nate...
my whole life, really...
you've always been number one.
and now for the first time, things are different.
I'm different.
I have college and a real relationship.
I'm starting to build a life for myself.
I'm building a life for myself, too.
with Carter? With your job as an assistant to a publicist who pays you to date a whacked-out movie star?
you're drifting away from Dan and your family, and you've lost Nate, one of your oldest friends.
this night is finally over...
and as far as I'm concerned, so are we.
who would have thought that S and B's friendship had a term limit?
sorry, ladies.
party's over.
thank you.
Hey, Brandeis.
I thought you'd be long gone by now.
Hey, Blair. Great party. - I am so sorry. I can't believe Serena told everyone you were a prostitute.
that is, like, so crazy.
well, to be honest, it's not... that crazy.
how so?
it's true. I'm a working girl.
I wanted to tell you, but we just met.
EW! Do you even go to school at N.Y.U?
Yes. And I am a psych major.
ask me anything... Freud, Skinner, Piaget.
I'm still the same person, Blair.
this is just how I pay for college and couture.
huh.
well, I have to run it by my people, but...
we can still shop together, perhaps.
Absolutely.
but right now...
I got a job.
you used me to meet new clients?
sorry, but I'm new to the Big Apple.
and rotten to the core.
okay, come on. Come on.
let's get you in. Easy.
come on. Watch your head. - Hey, come on. Let's go to Bar Boulud.
no. - You have to. You're my girlfriend.
I can't be seen without you, remember?
that's what you get paid for.
here you go. Come on.
710 East 76th Street.
tell Miss Cunningham she has a delivery.
I think Nathaniel was brilliant tonight, don't you?
brilliant? Foolish is more like it.
come on, William.
even you have to admit it.
this couldn't have worked any better if it was planned.
you.
all this time, you thought the only thing I was capable of was holding his hand and smiling on the sidelines.
to be honest, my dear,
I never really spent that much time thinking about you.
well, your loss is my gain.
my husband is a congressman.
and thanks to Vanessa's camera, you're out of our lives for good.
finally Tripp can be his own man,
my man.
you think I'm really just going to stand aside, let myself become collateral damage?
I'll tell him.
you don't exactly have a lot of credibility right now.
who's he going to believe?
I thought you said you were going home.
I changed my mind.
well, if I'd known,
I would have come sooner.
did you ever find Brandeis?
Yes.
we're not friends anymore.
but that's okay.
I have you.
that's all I need.
sometimes it's hard to see the lines we've drawn until we cross them.
this is used for the saki cups.
all right, oh, you know, I did want to say something.
uh, we want to apologize for last time.
I was a little hard on your boyfriend, and I apologize for that, so, Dan, if you're watching, - we wanted to say happy anniversary. - Oh!
this is for you, Olivia and Dan.
happy anniversary. I'm very sorry. - Thank you. Oh!
that's when we rely on the ones we love to pull us back and give us something to hold on to.
congratulations, congressman elect.
s... Serena, thank you.
shouldn't you be in the ballroom?
probably.
Where's your better half?
I don't know. I was looking for her.
then I realized this might be my last private moment for a while.
well, I can leave. - No, it's okay. Stay. Please.
I'd love to have someone to sit with, not talking about politics, not talking about anything.
you wanna tell me about it?
no. I... I don't think you want to hear this one.
I do. Let your problem be the first that I address as your elected representative.
okay, congressman.
but I'm gonna warn you. This one might need a special committee.
uh, wait. This sounds serious.
bartender, I'll have what she's having.
uh, I'll have another, please. Thank you.
then there are the clearly marked lines, the ones that if you dare cross, you may never find your way back.
X. O.X. O. Gossip Girl.
gossip girl here your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
dad, I am so sorry. I wanted to tell you. - Tell me what?
this is Milo Humphrey, your grandson.
a body washed up in Paris-shot.
the identification they found says it's Charles Bass.
what's your name? - Henry.
welcome to Paris, Henry. - Let's go home.
I think I need to be alone for a while.
Oh, so I didn't realize you and Serena were actually over.
I'm not gonna spend the entire summer waiting for her to figure things out.
could I at least get your number?
what, it's not in your friend's little black book?
when you're ready to talk about what really got you into this place, give me a call.
you know what? You were right. I...I was hurt.
do you wanna meet up to grab a cup of coffee? - That sounds great, yeah.
I thought that someone who loved what I love could one day love me, too, - but I guess not. - No, no, no.
I've been acting like I'm okay, but I'm not.
what if I never get over Chuck?
summer is coming to a close, and as everyone knows, Paris, like the upper east side, empties out in august, leaving behind only the tourists and the dreamers, lamenting the imminent return to real life.
I can't believe it's almost time to go back to New York already.
I know, and you still haven't made your Sophie's choice between Brooklyn and the upper east side.
what?
if you go back with an uncertain heart, there will be drama and disaster for all.
it's like choosing between Eclairs and Napoleons.
they're both delicious. - Except Humphrey's a doughnut.
well, I would love to stay and talk patisserie, but I have to get ready for my perfect parisian date.
wait, what? You got louis to give you a second chance? B.that's great.
and to prove that I care about more than his title,
I've planned a day of polite interaction with the proletariat.
think Diana, princess of the people.
obviously, I'll wear gloves. - Obviously.
well, I'm off to buy gently worn items in the 12th.
and don't worry.
not even you choosing a Humphrey will ruin my date.
nothing will.
au revoir. - Au revoir - Hi, mom. - I'm sorry to bother you on your last day, Serena.
I got a very upsetting phone call from the Paris police.
Oh, if it's about Blair pushing me in the fountain, I'm not pressing charges.
they pulled a body out of the river and found Charles' wallet.
Oh, my god.
you don't think it's him, do you?
well, it would be a lot easier not to panic if someone had heard from him or he had been paying the empire bills.
listen, um, sweetheart, they need a family member to identify the body.
if it's too much for you, I will be on the next flight.
no, no, I'm-i'm here. I can do it.
thank you.
listen, let's just keep this between us. I don't want to worry anyone until we know for sure what's really going on.
yean, I agree.
I'm sorry for the 7-hour-long story.
are you kidding?
Serena took her best friend's boyfriend's virginity, ran away to boarding school, bounced from guy to guy until dating your married congressman cousin, fell in love with you, and then cheated on you - with your friend, who's also her ex? - Yep.
the only thing that would make it better is if one of those boyfriends turned out to be her brother.
well, does stepbrother count?
the life of serena van der woodsen is like the most complicated Jane Austen novel ever.
aren't you glad you finally reached the last chapter?
I need to talk to you
I haven't even responded yet.
things between us - They never really ended. They just...Stopped, and...
instead of dealing with them, I - I just...
you little-black-booked the pain away? - Exactly.
well, do you wanna get back together with her? - I don't know.
you know, it would be nice if I were the one deciding, not her.
in that case, the first thing you need to do is eliminate the competition.
what was his name again? Dan's not the competition, all right. He's my friend.
besides, for all I know, he's not even interested in her anymore.
and what happens if it's too late by the time you find out?
look...I can help. Let me...
be your life coach for the next 24 hours, and I promise you, you will be in a place where you're the one making the choice.
Brooklyn, you say?
why don't we just both go home, shower, get dressed, and I'll meet you there?
sounds good. - Good.
the body was in no condition for fingerprints, but... We found this.
that's his.
we're testing the blood on the wallet.
do you need a moment to gather yourself?
no amount of time will ever make this okay.
five more minutes.
as pleasurable as those 300 seconds sound, your uncle was already generous enough to help the strange American you brought home from Prague.
I don't want to be late for my first day on the job.
one thing I'll miss about taking care of you after the shooting will be spending all day in bed together.
I couldn't have enjoyed being saved more.
I'm just happy to be taking care of you now.
I know a way you could take care of me right now.
I wouldn't be able to tear myself away.
then what would your uncle think?
you're a good man, Henry prince. Too good ?
this loft is your loft ?
this loft is my loft ?
Where's your aunt Jenny?
she moved to Hudson ?
she wears...leggings ?
I did not need to see or hear that.
no. Well, I'm-i'm doing the best I can.
who's this? - This is Juliet Sharp. She's a new friend.
pleasure to meet you, dan. - Hi.
I hope you don't mind me tagging along.
no, no. Vanessa's supposed to be here already, and Georgina's at the spa, and milo has not been taking his bottle all morning.
Oh, buddy. I think he's kind of mad at me.
you all right? Yeah, you wanna hold him, Nate?
you don't expect me to sing, do you?
no. Just make sure you prop his neck up. - Oh, he smells funny.
Oh, maybe he just needs a woman's voice. - Okay.
whatever you were singing was definitely not that.
ask him, like we agreed.
come here. Yeah. You're so cute.
she's definitely not out of Chuck's little black book.
no. No, she, uh, sure isn't.
So...Have you heard from Serena lately?
uh, no. No, I haven't. I would assume she's still in Paris or at Brown already.
actually, gossip girl said she's going to Columbia.
She's-she's coming back to the city for school now?
that's what the blast said. You not okay with that?
no. No, I'm fine with it...
I guess. I - I'm just surprised she didn't say anything to me about it.
but if she didn't say anything to you...
Hey, Dan, can you grab a diaper? - Yeah. Yeah, I'll do it.
I need to talk you
what is it?
well, he said he hadn't heard from her.
looks like Dan's playing a game with you.
now do you want to win, or do you want to lose?
I suppose it's worth missing you if it means staying in a place where you don't have nightmares.
and you look very handsome in your work clothes.
well, I look forward to you removing them after an honest day's work.
Bye. - Bye
they say it's easy to forget your troubles when the weather's warm.
but all it takes is one fall breeze to blow reality right back in your face.
what are you doing? Suddenly we're stopping for pedestrians? Vite!
watch out, Blair.
he who sows the wind reaps the storm.
next time, I promise we'll do shoes and vintage, and not just health food stores.
let me see that beautiful boy.
well, you guys seem to have bonded.
we had a nice talk.
Hey. - Aw, Vanessa, you're amazing with him.
Yeah, she's a serious baby whisperer.
living on a commune, you clock a lot of babysitting hours. Right?
okay, I get what you're doing, and it's not exactly subtle.
the goal is to take him out of the equation.
not by using Vanessa.
she's still totally in love with him.
she's just hurt by what happened last spring, and she's looking for a sign to see how he really feels about her.
she told you that? - She didn't have to.
I'm not trying to ruin people's lives.
Vanessa and Dan are great people.
and from what I hear, they made a great couple, too.
okay, I will. I love you, too. Bye.
I love you, nate or "I love you, Dan"? - "I love you, mom.
well, it's all right. Now that I'm an egalitarian, I'll accept it even if you choose Dan, and not just because he's ahead in the "gossip girl" poll.
gossip girl has a poll?
honestly, I haven't even thought about it.
B.I went to the morgue today. What is that? A sex club?
a place where they keep dead bodies.
I had to identify one because he had Chuck's i. d.
don't worry. It wasn't him. - I'm not worried.
but, Blair, I just hung up with my mom, and Chuck is missing.
well, consider him found. He was on the rue de Charenton an hour ago.
what, you saw him? Here?
gossip girl said I was in paris. Where else would he be?
my mom and the police are looking everywhere.
he hasn't paid an empire bill all summer. His assets are about to be frozen.
I could care less about his bassets.
and besides, he's probably filtering his finances through some foreign government so that I won't know he's stalking me.
well, what did he say when you saw him?
nothing. He limped away, and I kept driving.
that doesn't sound very stalker-ish. It's Chuck.
it's probably part of some elaborate scheme.
well, he did have blood on his wallet, and you said you saw him limping.
don't you think we should at least make sure he's okay?
I'm sorry he pissed off the wrong pickpocket.
but I've been waiting for this date all summer. I'm not gonna let him ruin it.
I'm sure Louis would understand if you're a little late. Look...
I can't talk to him, s.
you don't know what it was like, seeing him, even through the car window.
trust me, the only thing wrong with Chuck is that I'm gonna be happy without him.
your oysters, Henry. Here.
looks like you've had enough for today, Jacques.
Hey. - Hey.
I thought you might be ready for a break.
I have to ask.
uncle, has Henry worked hard enought to earn a break?
your first day made me believe not all american are lazy.
I see you tomorrow. Enjoy paris.
Merci.
Merci. Voil? monsieur.
what is wrong?
are you mad at me? - No, you're perfect.
I was just thinking maybe this isn't the right place for us after all.
Why?
was working with oncle Alphonse so horrible?
it's not the job. It's Paris.
but you loved it this morning.
and you slept through the night for the first time in weeks.
true, but I credit you with all of that.
I mean, we could live anywhere and be happy.
I hear India is amazing.
for Fran is and Salma, maybe.
but we can barely afford the bus to Lorraine.
I may have a way to figure out the finances.
well, that was an interesting call.
was that paris? News about Chuck? That was Dr. Feiner from Lenox hill.
unfortunately, he cannot discuss Milo's medical records with anyone other than his parents.
I was just hoping to get some more information, make sure this guy's even a real doctor, not some sex phone operator that crazy girl - paid off to lie to us. - Oh, now who's crazy?
Georgina went for a spa weekend right after Dan signed the birth certificate.
we need to get our own paternity test done while she's gone.
well, she said we could. It's not like we have to sneak around behind her back.
now whatever you might believe, your son is in Brooklyn, struggling to take care of a baby.
so you can sit here and brood all by yourself, or you can come with me and help me turn Jenny's room into a nursery so that child has a proper place to sleep.
well...you know where I'll be if you change your mind.
have you ever seen anyone sleep so deeply?
I know you said things were complicated, but you and Dan really seem to click.
we do...Or did, before the thing with Serena.
you have to tell her.
Dan made Nate promise not to tell you, so...
you can't say anything, but he does have feelings for you.
he told us himself. - Really?
you should go for it, yeah.
my friend saw him around here this morning.
he has an intimate relationship with alcohol, so I figured I'd check all the bars first.
he doesn't drink here, but he looks very much like my new waiter.
is he American, from New York?
all I know is he came to Paris from, uh, Prague with my niece.
well, if he's who I think he is, he could be in a lot of trouble.
I - I need to talk to him.
he doesn't do much talking, especially about himself.
please, sir, I've been to every bar in the neighborhood.
and he's my stepbrother, and I'm very worried about him.
if you have any idea where he is, please...
tell me you didn't rob a bank.
my grandfather left me a small inheritance.
I've just been waiting for the right thing to spend it on.
but it doesn't look small to me.
it's enough to get us to London, then Kerala.
are you sure you wanna do this?
I've never been more sure of anything.
is it hot or cold in Kerala?
do we need shots?
and what do I pack?
Chuck, it's you. - Who's here?
Oh, hi. I'm Serena van der woodsen.
I'm-I'm really sorry to show up like this.
I've just been looking for Chuck everywhere.
Henry, what is she talking about? I don't know.
the man you're looking for is not here.
holy bruce wayne, batman.
it's one thing to hide who you really are.
it's another to pretend you don't exist.
I had no idea you had such deep appreciation for street food.
I'm quite surprised that your favorite restaurant is on rue de la Huchette.
Yes, well, the masterpieces of the Louvre don't compare to the simple pleasures of the kebab.
Paris is complicated and beautiful...
much like you.
but you know what's even better than street food? Street artists.
I heard there's an amazing bucket drummer at the pont neuf metro station.
should we investigate?
well, I was thinking more of a chauffeured drive in the country, to the ball my parents are throwing for the givenchy exhibition.
givenchy was Audrey's favorite.
does that mean you - You'll allow me to escort you to cheau de Harou?
nothing would make me happier, except maybe saving this for later.
Hey. Where's Milo?
I gave him a bottle and put him down in your bedroom.
you know, he should really have a nursery.
Yeah, I know. I've been meaning to get to that.
you hungry? - Always. I can't remember the last time that
I ate something that didn't come out of a...A box.
did you do all this? I thought you deserved a bottle, too.
you've been under so much pressure, I can't even imagine.
I really missed you.
I missed you, too.
I know that I-I- I haven't gotten a full night's sleep in a while.
I don't really know what i'm saying half the time.
but I'm so grateful that you've been here helping me.
and after everything that-that, you know, I put your through, which I haven't even apologized for, - I haven't explained it - Stop talking.
you know I'm not good at that.
I think I can help.
I had a feeling you'd linger. - I'm not gonna leave.
Chuck, today I had to identify a body that the police thought was you.
did you do something to that man?
if-if it was self-defense, i'm sure that they would understand.
I never touched that thief.
so is Blair right? Is this another one of your games?
do I look like I'm playing?
I know more than anyone what it's like to want to reinvent yourself.
but just because people are mad at you doesn't mean you should disappear.
my mom is really worried about you.
I'm sure she'll come to celebrate my absence, as will all the people who've wished me dead since the day I was born.
I know things were bad in new york.
but if you don't come home, you'll lose the empire. You'll lose everything you ever cared about.
I already lost the only thing I cared about. They can have everything else.
I don't know what you told that girl, but you can't turn your back on who you really are.
I'm going to see an old associate, picking up a passport with my new name on it.
after today, there is no chuck bass.
I'm staying at Eleanor and cyrus' when you realize that's not true.
Wow.
that was, uh...
yeah...
I'll have to thank Nate the next time I see him.
I'm sorry, but, I mean,
I don't mean to be a credit hog, but that was all me.
no, I mean, I'm just I'm glad that he told me.
told you what?
the truth.
Wh-about what?
okay, after I told Nate that I was nervous about you still being in love with Serena, esaid that it wasn't true and that you told him you still had feelings for me.
and there it is.
I - I'll go.
okay.
perhaps it should be tilted more, comme
Oh, wow.
a coronation already?
the date must've gone well.
we walked, we talked, we laughed.
I'd forgotten what it was like to just have fun with a guy.
and now I'm off to meet his parents at a ball.
just look at all the gowns he sent!
the fairy tale is back on as long as the evil queen doesn't ruin it.
well, if you're talking about Chuck, don't worry.
the only person he wants to poison is himself.
you talked to Chuck?
no.
I don't care.
I don't even wanna know what he said.
and I won't be pulled back into the darkness.
you're right.
go live your fairy tale.
don't worry about chuck.
if that is didier ludot, tell them they should've been more prompt!
now, you... This is all wrong.
I can't believe your people invented the coiffure.
Yes.
that's more like it.
I can't even see myself!
gorgeous blonde.
Princeton.
Oh, and look.
her family has a house by ours in Trancoso.
okay, yeah, she sounds great,
but I don't get it. What are you saying?
you're gonna go on a date with her.
well, I thought the whole point was to be available.
the point was for Dan not to be.
you have to have somebody fabulous on your arm so Serena doesn't think that you spent the whole summer pining for her.
here, let me call
okay, listen, I appreciate the gesture, but you don't know Serena van der woodsen.
not just any hot girl is gonna spark her jealousy.
so what are you saying?
you have a better option?
Louis, merci pour tout... no.
I can't do any more of these prince and pauper games.
I'm sorry, madame.
Monsieur simply asked me to escort you for one final touch before the gala.
would you like to come with me to harry Winston?
would I?
is there some business you need to attend to before we go?
um... Nothing I have any interest in.
escort away.
remember when I told you not to worry about Chuck?
well, I was wrong.
Spotted-one American leaving paris.
au revoir, l'enfant terrible.
I wouldn't bother you if it wasn't serious.
I need your help.
finally.
inspector Chevalier, of course.
okay, I'll be right there.
it's beautiful.
I mean, of course, they all are.
Monsieur Grimaldi would want me to be sure it was perfect.
like that.
carats, clarity, charisma.
not that I expect Louis to get me a ring so soon, but...
this is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
I am sorry.
this ring has already been sold.
shouldn't you be out dealing with your own issues instead of hunting me down?
I didn't even know you were here.
why are you here?
why are you?
I see that you have found monsieur Bass' stolen property.
Mr. Bass' property?
the ring is his?
that's why I'm here.
inspector Chevalier asked me to claim it.
the thieves couldn't pawn such a valuable piece at their usual haunts in Prague, so they came to Paris to try to return it for the cash.
Harry Winston knew monsieur bass was the original purchaser.
that's when they called us.
and the body you saw was one of the thieves.
so why was Chuck's blood on the wallet?
Monsieur Bass would not let go of the ring.
he fought them hard, so they shot him.
Chuck was shot?
let me explain...
what the hell, man?
you told Vanessa I had feelings for her?
I just thought you two were connecting.
why are we whispering?
is she still here?
Yeah, she's-yeah, just keep whispering.
okay.
look, you guys spent all day together, just the two of you.
so? Just because things were great doesn't give you the right to lie to her about me.
was it a lie?
this is about Serena.
it is, isn't it?
okay, I wouldn't have said anything to Vanessa if you hadn't lied about getting that text.
what text?
when's the last time you checked your phone?
obviously not as recently as you did.
Oh, man.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
it's from Serena.
I thought you saw it.
I got the same one.
same one what?
um... Uh, it -it's a text from Serena.
Yeah.
so she's interested in both of you?
Yeah, that's kind of what it seems like.
Yeah, or she's interested in one of us, and just wants to, like, let the other one down easy maybe.
is that why you told me dan had feelings?
Yeah. I'm...i'm sorry, Vanessa.
Oh, my god.
how stupid can I be to think you'd actually put Serena behind you?
Vanessa, I'm...
surprise!
it's time for an extreme nursery make over.
you know that ring was meant for you.
he was gonna propose to you on top of the empire state building.
I can't care about that.
it doesn't change what he did instead Jenny Humphrey
I know how much he hurt you.
he knows how much he hurt you.
that's why he signed over the empire and everything he owns to my mom.
well, hopefully she can run it without entering the human flesh trade.
Blair, he's changing his name.
his landlady said he's on his way to the train station.
this is Chuck we're talking about.
he really could just disappear.
if you're so torn up about it, stop him.
you and I both know you're the only one that can do that.
if you'll excuse me, I have a ball to attend.
Blair, he almost died holding onto that ring and to the hope of you.
I forgave him for something that no one else in the world would ever get over.
then he turned around and did the one thing he knew I could never let go.
but you don't need to forgive him.
you don't even need to talk to him again after today.
but I know you, and you will always regret it if you do nothing and just let him disappear.
Ah. I'm sorry.
I know.
the truth is, I don't even know how I feel about Serena.
I just... I want a clear shot at finding out without you don't have to say it.
Yeah.
how do you feel about her?
I was in the middle of trying to figure that out when
I was interrupted by the arrival of Georgina's swollen belly.
it was kinda-kinda hard to focus after that.
I'll take your word for it.
you know, and being with Vanessa
even if it is thanks to your meddling felt good.
and all of our problems from last year Tisch, whatever.
they just feel really, really small now.
too bad she hates you.
Yeah, maybe.
or maybe it's for the best. I don't know.
anyway, Serena gets back tomorrow.
what are we gonna do?
I knew it was too good to be true.
who is she?
just because you're dressed poorly doesn't mean you're not Chuck Bass.
why would I want to be him?
you should've told me you got shot.
I'm surprised you didn't shoot me yourself.
I have, many times, in my dreams.
the good ones.
but if you were really hurt, I would want to know.
when I woke up, my ider. Was gone.
nobody knew who I was.
nobody was coming to look for me.
I realized I might be alive, but Chuck Bass didn't have to be.
changing your name doesn't change who you are.
it's a good start, a chance to live simply, earn people's respect, maybe become a person someone could love.
someone did love you.
and... You owe it to her
and everyone else you're leaving behind
not to run away, which is what you're doing.
and I don't think that great man you're talking about wanting to be is a coward.
I think he would face up to what he did.
I destroyed the only thing I ever loved.
I don't love you anymore.
but it takes more than even you to destroy Blair Waldorf.
your world would be easier if I didn't come back.
that's true.
but it wouldn't be my world without you in it.
it doesn't feel right to be in new york without you.
did the plane ride back to reality land you on either nate or dan?
not exactly.
how could you spend seven hours on a plane with a library of romantic comedies and not find clarity?
trust me, I tried.
I even made a list of pros and cons.
Dan-good shoulder to cry on.
Nate-good shoulders.
well, as long as you promise that gossip girl won't find out before I do.
I have a poll to win.
I promise.
how are you?
well, I ate too many meringues at lunch, but talking to chuck made me realize what I want, too.
good.
well, I hope you get it then.
merci, mon amie.
thank you for calling me.
and you're right. I'm sorry.
it was wrong for me to interfere.
well, what was wrong was for me to hand over control of my life to a beautiful girl.
I just met in a restaurant.
seriously, what was up with that?
I'm kidding.
blame all here.
no more life coach.
friends?
friends.
I'd like to apologize to Dan as well.
I know this might actually sound weird, but I'm-i'm glad that yesterday happened.
Why?
because after your publicly broadcast pajama party with Serena, you thought I needed more humiliation?
no No
because last night when I read on "gossip girl" that Serena had boarded a plane home,
I didn't care.
all I could think about was making things right with you.
now whatever's happened in the past - Right here, right now - I wanna be with you.
I hope your calling me means your business is complete.
it is.
I'm sorry I distracted you from your parents' ball.
in Paris, there's always another ball.
the Sarkozys are saluting Jerry Lewis tomorrow night, if you're not otherwise engaged.
there's nothing I'd rather do than salute jerry lewis.
but... I can't live in this fairy tale.
I promise this is not a story for little girls.
but... I've been using it to run away from my real life on the upper east side.
someone there did something for me that I have to honor.
will I ever see you again?
you can always come find me.
it's Vivier.
it's worth a hell of a lot more than a glass slipper.
look, Milo, you have a nursery.
isn't it beautiful?
it is He's a lucky boy.
is this the David Netto crib that I ordered?
Oh, it's Dan and Jenny's.
I got it out of storage.
I wouldn't want my grandson sleeping in anything else.
I couldn't agree with you more.
what changed your mind?
you.
I'll never be sure if Georgina's telling me the whole truth, but dan is my son, and I'm not gonna bail on him.
and if I'm wrong, how much time have
I lost with this little guy 'cause I let my suspicions get the better of me?
here. I'm gonna go cancel the other crib.
would you take him?
sure. Hello, buddy.
thank you.
Milo, I think you have the Humphrey jaw.
mom! Hey!
darling, what are you doing here?
Laryssa told me where you were.
I came straight from the airport.
well, we have a surprise for you.
great, but first, I wanna find Dan and Nate. Find me?
I'm right here.
and Vanessa.
Hey, Serena.
nice to meet you.
Hey, Serena.
Rufus and... Baby?
this is Milo.
he's my son.
son?
you saw me four months ago.
if you thought I was pregnant, then I'm offended.
okay, is someone gonna help fill me in?
not it.
Yeah, I-I-I will explain everything.
just, uh, just sit down.
I gotta get him a bottle.
uh, I'll get it.
with Dan spotted kissing Vanessa and Nate's early morning coffees with a new blonde, it looks like the oddsmakers have taken a beating.
Serena van der woodsen will be walking onto columbia's campus single.
this poll is now closed, and nobody won.
so when I grabbed your hand back there, you seemed to like it.
was that just a part of the act, or do I actually have a shot at a date?
you've been over Serena for, like, seven minutes.
you're not ready for me yet.
and when I am?
you know how to find me.
just as every summer ends, all tourists come home, all dreamers wake up, and new problems are born.
what's all this?
Oh, it was laying around the nursery.
I thought I'd put it into a baby book for Dan.
that's a good idea.
Oh, is this Milo's hospital bracelet?
look how tiny his wrist was.
either this is a mistake or... Or what?
Milo's bracelet says his blood type is o-negative.
that's a universal donor.
that's not common.
Rufus, enough conspiracy theories.
look, the closest you've been to medical school is having a Lincoln Hawk song licensed for "Chicago hope."
when Dan got his appendix out as a kid,
I banked some blood just in case something went wrong.
he's A. B positive, same as me.
okay, so Georgina is type o.
I'm sure she is.
likely, so is Milo's real father.
I had to improvise, but it's done.
I'll see you soon, and we'll talk about what's next.
take care.
I miss you.
when you didn't come home last night,
I assumed you'd left with that girl.
I owe you an apology.
I don't expect you to understand, but where I'm from, people lie and cheat and destroy whoever gets in their way.
I did it better than any of them.
when you dragged me in from the alley, you didn't just save my life.
you gave me the hope of a new one.
well, the you I've been living with never did anything to be ashamed of.
I hope... I hope you'll bring some of him with you back to your world.
I fully intend to... If you'll come with me.
to New York?
you got me a ticket?
we don't need tickets.
I'm Chuck Bass.
but no matter what the new season brings, we'll always have Paris.
Bisou bisou, gossip girl.
gossip girl here
your - How are thing going? - The guys were easy, but the girl are presenting a little bit more of a challenge.
we'll get it done. I promise.
there's no way that I'm letting you take this child.
it's not your choice. He's not your son.
how stupid can I be to think you'd actually put Serena behind you?
I'm not sure how I feel about Serena.
I need to talk to you.
I just want a clear shot at finding out.
I, um, met someone. Her name's Eva.
Chuck will soon realize that it doesn't matter if the dress is couture if the girl is off-the-rack, and then as with all things that don't fit, you'll be sent back to where you came from.
CHUCK: all about eva!
overnight, our brooding billionaire's become a generous gentlemen.
Philanthrophy's New Darlings
but what's responsible for this metamorphosis?
or should I say who?
the Woman Behind the New Chuck Bass
has a French fairy touched Chuck with her magic wand?
or does simply being with an angel make you want to grow wings, too?
sorry, Miss Blair. No papers today.
I think maybe 8h steal them again.
Dorota, we both know that it was you , not Susan Lucci, who took my papers.
but there's no point. It's all over the Internet.
what is? - What are you reading?
Chuck gave Eva a limited edition Baignoire Cartier watch.
"gossip Girl" even has a whole thread where people can guess how much it cost.
how can she even see time through all that sparkly?
I-I go get more coffee.
how can I stomach going to his charity gala later?
watching everyone "ooh" and "ooh la la over that French floozy and that watch?
some are speculating it cost more than anything he ever gave me.
B.I know it's hard to see Chuck with someone else.
but you have to stop doing this to yourself.
I'm just worried about him.
we've seen this before!
strangers weaseling their way into our hearts.
clearly, Eva has an agenda.
I'm guessing it's his money.
you know, Eva actually seems nice. And even if she isn't, it's not your business anymore.
and it's your business to be monitoring Nate and Juliet?
and even worse, Humphrey and Dumpty?
fine. We're both having trouble moving on.
but it was just so easy in Paris. - You were so easy in Paris.
enough. But now.
now you're here, and those boys are taken.
for now. - Yes, you're right.
maybe Dan and Nate will see the error of their ways and break up with those girls, or they'll marry them, and you'll die hitting refresh.
okay, fine. You know what?
I will stay away from Nate and Dan, but you have to stay away from Chuck and Eva.
no plotting, no meddling, no Blair Waldorf-ing.
I'm not going to. I wasn't. I...
was going shopping anyway.
okay, then I'm just gonna stay home and unpack all day. No gala.
and tonight - Deal? - Deal.
Hey. How are you, sleepyhead? - Ah, never better.
you making pancakes? - Yeah. I noticed you haven't been eating much, so I thought I'd make 'em for you.
and there's still time to take a shower.
do you wanna change your clothes? - No. No, I'm good. I'm fine
you've been wearing that shirt for, like, three days.
well, I'm sorry, mom. I didn't realize when you moved in, you'd be...you'd be laundry monitor.
it's a beautiful Saturday. I thought maybe we could go to the promenade, talk.
talk? Talk about what?
your pancakes are burning. Why did you bring out four plates?
don't be mad. This has been going on too long, so I had to call for backup.
something smells delicious.
merci, Ivan.
so, Ivan, how did your mets do last night?
heartbreak as usual, Mr. Bass. Thanks for asking.
if I may, the flowers are right for the gala. Simply beautiful.
as is the woman who choose them.
Hi! I'm sorry I'm late. Traffic on Broadway. - Hey, I was calling you.
my phone died, drowned by a spilled latte.
no worries. - Sorry.
I hope you two are coming to my charity event later. - Party on the roof?
we wouldn't miss it. - Good,'cause I'm announcing a $5 million charity.
what? $ 5 million? - Chuck, that's amazing.
what's the lucky organization?
poor thing can't make up his mind.
petroleum apocalypse, the education crisis, poverty, disease, not to mention the recession.
it seems outside my Bassian bubble, the world is a pretty screwed up place.
well, the good news is, whichever you pick will be eternally grateful.
if it's not too hypocritical - I think - I'll join you.
champagne.
thank you.
so I didn't know him before, but I heard stories.
you're a great influence. He's really changed.
I take no credit.
old Chuck, bad Chuck, new Chuck, good Chuck.
to me, it's one man, one... journey.
you really are from Europe.
why are you staring at me? - Philanthropy?
chatting with the help about sports? It's nice to see you...nice
well, it's all Eva. She cared about me before she knew who I was.
I guess I wanna prove her right. How's things with you and Juliet?
good, I guess.
you know, I don't know why she's never invited me over to her apartment.
and she's extremely hard to make plans with.
and considering school just started, she's got an awful lot of homework.
Nathaniel, most people don't go from zero to monogamous so soon.
she's probably seeing other people.
no. Nah, I don't think so.
Nate, I'm sorry. I know I just got here, but my neighbor - she's locked out, and I have her spare key.
so I have to go. I'm sorry. - What are you...
Bye. - Okay. Bye.
I thought her phone died.
so what is this, a talk-about-your-feelings intervention?
no. We just want you to know that we're here for you.
and that you do need to talk.
so, yeah, this is a kind of talk-about-your-feelings intervention.
all right, well, I'm fine. - Dan, you've been sleeping all day, cutting class.
I-I caught you watching "Wild Hogs" and laughing.
it's okay to admit that you're depressed that Georgina took the baby.
guys, I'm sleeping because I haven't in months. I'm laughing because I
I finally got the stench of baby poop out of my nostrils. I'm relieved, all right?
I mean, it's not like I've been hiding out here. I went out.
I got a...I got a haircut. - You thought Milo was your son.
you watched as he was born. You held him in your arms. - You loved him.
but he wasn't mine.
he... he was... he was a waste of a summer.
now if you will excuse me, thank you for coming.
where are you going? - I'm gonna go to Nate's.
would've told you sooner, but your intervention intervened. I'll see you later.
I know what you're up to.
you're at Cartier, checking the cost of that watch. You're breaking your pact.
and you're looking at "Gossip Girl," thereby breaking yours.
anyway, it just so happens that my watch is broken.
you were wearing it yesterday, and it worked perfectly fine.
well... Now it doesn't.
Blair, we had a deal.
B? Why did you stop talking? - No reason.
Hey. I know we haven't talked in a while, but I was taking a walk, found myself at your door.
spotted... one angel selling her halo.
careful, Eva.
returning that watch may cost you the time of your life.
good afternoon, Chuck. I thought we might enjoy some tea.
you know how I adore those empire bacon scones.
I know everything about you, which is why I know your visit probably has more to do with a scheme than a scone.
Chuck, you've changed. What makes you think I haven't?
and speaking of your newfound affinity - how - leave her alone, Blair.
if you're as serious about her as Cindy Adams thinks, then we'll be crossing paths all the time. And don't you think we should be friends?
there she is!
uh, don't worry. Blair was just... - sitting for some tea.
scone? - I'd love to.
Eva, I must apologize. The first time we met,
I had no idea you'd be the woman who could finally change Chuck Bass.
Oh, the Chuck I've known has always been kind and generous, even when he had nothing himself.
you should've known him before he was shot.
once, he sold me for a hotel.
actually, Blair, she knows. We have no secrets.
blackmailers must be weeping all over town.
Eva, I read about Chuck's gift, and forgive me for being vulgar, but I've always wanted a Baignoire timepiece. Might I see it?
Oh, I-I don't have it on. I brought it in to be resized.
are you sure you mean resized?
cause I think you brought it in to be returned for cash.
see? That is Eva selling the watch.
it is pretty... The watch, I mean, not the wad of hundies.
though Eva might disagree. - Eva, what's going on?
I needed the money for a friend.
that weak excuse might've worked in the former Vichy Republic, - but Chuck and I are savvy new yorkers. - She gave me the money, Mr. Bass.
please don't be mad.
Ivan's mother was about to lose the house he grew up in.
at first, he was too proud to accept help, but I wore him down.
my valet. W-why would you do that?
I'm a stranger here, and Ivan is one of the few people who have been kind to me.
your gift meant so much, but...
I couldn't wear something that decadent when it could save a family from losing their home.
I'm sorry. Don't be angry with me.
how could I ever be angry at you?
just do me one favor. - Anything.
pick the charity for me to give my money to.
your heart'll find the right one.
well, I'm sure you... you've that heard Milo's not mine.
Georgina took him back. - Yeah, my mom told me. I'm sorry.
how do you feel?
Vanessa and everyone keeps asking me that, trying to get me to talk about it, like it was this crushing blow.
but I just got my life back. I wanna enjoy it now, you know?
okay. Well, then we won't talk about it.
we'll just spend the day having fun. Just you and me, okay?
uh, but first, I have to deal with this. Sorry.
Hello? - I saw Eva selling her watch back to Cartier for cash.
are you kidding me? - Then I went to Chuck's and witnessed her give the world's most credible altruistic excuse.
B.this is not what you promised me.
Hey, I'm gonna get a pretzel. - Is that Dan?
that is not what you promised me. - No, it's different. He came to me.
first, nonsense! Second, I really don't care right now.
Chuck's about to be taken for a ride. We need to take that tart down!
now Humphrey has proven his worth in the past. He could be useful to us now.
this is not a good idea.
Serena, do you remember when Chuck gave his heart to his mother?
that was the beginning of the end of everything. Please.
okay, what do you want us to do? - Get on your computer. I'll text you clues as I get them.
see?
needy dogs are the perfect cause.
Oh, and so much cuter than those children with the cleft palates that you were going to pick.
we need to think in terms of the Bass annual report cover when making decisions like this.
I admit, Blair, when you ran into me outside the empire and offered to help me pick a charity, I was a little skeptical.
but you seem to have Chuck's best interests at heart.
well, it's the least I could do after that whole watch snafu earlier.
I'm... I'm sorry again.
I guess I must just still be protective of Chuck. Old habits.
but I still wanna be friends.
tell me everything. I wanna hear your whole life story.
Nathaniel, I'm on my way out to the...
what are you doing? - These pictures of Juliet
she's coming out of the 116th street subway station at 10: 00 P. M.on nights she said she had too much work to go out with me.
you were right.
she's gotta be seeing someone else. What do I do?
well, the old Chuck Bass would've told you to play the same game, make her jealous.
but the new Chuck thinks you should be honest, tell her how you feel, how much you like her.
I hope you didn't lose old Chuck's number.
Eva was just spotted at the park... with Blair.
Eva's strong. She can handle Blair. I'll see you later.
so did you have dogs growing up?
well, I grew up on a farm in the Loire valley. We had lots of animals.
Oh, love the Loire. Which part?
Eva grew up on a goat farm outside of Orleans in Loire Valley. They were cheesemakers
they were...cheesemakers. This is ridiculous.
you don't have to stay here and do this. - No, it's okay. I'm having fun.
I mean, we always have fun. - We do.
and hey, even though you may regret entering my world, at least you've developed terrific social espionage skills.
well, as they say, adapt or die.
Ah, all right, as I expected, there are no regional cheese scandals of note. What do we got next?
I was in my first year of nursing school when my grandfather died.
turned out he owed more money than the farm was worth, so I dropped out of school to help pay for the bills.
I knew some girls who were going to Prague to look for work, and I decided to go with them.
and what did you do when you got there? Open an orphanage or tend to tend to lepers?
no, I waited tables.
I worked in a hotel for a while and sent everything back home.
then I met Chuck, and the rest you know.
you met him in his hotel? - Actually, I was in my room when I heard the gunshots.
I went downstairs and... - you found him?
well, when the ambulance didn't show up, I knew I had to do something myself.
so...
you're a beautiful blonde nurse without a mean bone in your body, and you literally saved Chuck's life?
you make it sound like I'm an angel. I just...
I just did what I had to.
why do you think the ambulance didn't show up?
might have something to do with the neighborhood we were in.
Chuck isn't exactly the first person to get shot in Perlovka.
voila. Perlovka.
you are good at this. - Not only am I manly and rugged, but I also have mad browsing skills.
don't laugh. Most women would be ripping their clothes off in the presence of this kind of web savvy.
Oh, really? - I'm not lying.
does Vanessa know you're here?
no. I told her I was going to Nate's.
why'd you lie?
because...
after she moved in, things - they've just been very weird.
they've been hard. I mean, she keeps pressuring me all the time, and I...
I think the truth is, she's not convinced that I'm over you.
and I'm probably not.
wait a second. Perlovka? Is Blair sure about that one?
what are you doing here?
I wanted to make up for having to leave this morning.
Hey. What's up?
okay, this may sound a little creepy, but I read the thread about you on "Gossip Girl."
I should've figured that was gonna happen at some point.
have you been lying to me?
Nate... - It's okay if you've been seeing other people.
I mean, we never said we were gonna be exclusive. I just...
you know, with everything that happened with Serena, - I need you to be honest with me about it. - I'm not seeing anybody else.
nor do I want to, if...if you don't. - I don't.
what were you doing then? - I was visiting someone.
I promise you, I am not dating anybody else.
Hey, guys. I'm here to kidnap Dan.
where is he?
the woman is a Saint!
she didn't recoil from those creepy cat rescuers or turn away from the pictures of those starving children.
she didn't even cringe when that homeless man licked her arm.
well, she might be used to weird guys licking her.
Yeah, cause she may be a Saint, but she's also a prostitute.
looks like Eva's past may be Blair perfect present.
but what's more dangerous for Chuck...
Eva's secret or what B. may do with it?
well, when you told us - where Eva first met Chuck, it's in Prague's red light district. So almost as a joke, I looked up brothels.
and a lot of them have web sites.
turns out Eva has good love for you.
I've never been so happy for Internet porn.
Humphrey, you've done a fine job. Serena and I can take it from here.
okay, but you may lose me to CSI: Williamsburg.
Serena made certain promises today that don't include you.
but, Dan, this is crucial information that has to be deployed expertly.
please promise you won't tell anyone.
she means "thank you." I'll call you later. - No, she won't!
Serena, you have to come and help me find a dress for the gala.
but we said we weren't going.
where else am I going to announce to the world that Chuck's new lady is a lady of the evening?
do not embarrass them in public.
pull him aside, tell him in private. Let him handle it.
can I at least look fabulous while doing it?
you know, you didn't have to kick Dan out.
Serena, you promised to stay away from Nate and Dan.
wait. Are you telling me you chose?
and that things with Dan and Vanessa are...
I think. Maybe, yeah.
well, as much as nature would applaud you, for heading off any possible future Humphrey/Abrams offspring, you have to ask yourself, are you ready to do what it takes to make him yours?
seems like we both need to look fabulous.
Hey. Dad, what are you still doing here?
Lily went to get her hair done for Chuck's gala.
I'm taking a pass, so I thought I'd get some of my stuff out of here and organize it at home, give Vanessa the closet space.
didn't she find you at Nate's?
jeez, for kids addicted to their cell phones, you never actually seem to use them to communicate.
I was with Serena, actually.
Dan, you need to face what's really going on here. - Dad, nothing is going on.
I... Milo is gone.
I don't need to be an adult anymore. And I was just...
can't I have a fun day with a friend?
not if it involves lying to the woman you're living with.
Dan, talk to me.
when Milo was here, every decision I made was for his benefit.
but now, I mean, I just... I-I wonder if I made all the wrong choices.
when Georgina showed up here that day, pregnant...
I mean, I was - I was about to fly to Paris. I was gonna tell Serena that I loved her and I would do whatever it took to get her back, and...
Yeah, hold on.
uh, it's... it's Nate. I'm sorry. I gotta take this.
Hey, man. I was just about to call you. - I covered for you.
and I think Vanessa bought it, but you know I'm a bad liar.
Juliet took her for coffee. What's going on?
it's complicated.
does "complicated" mean you're cheating on Vanessa?
no, no, no. I'm not cheating. I'm not cheating. But I was with Serena.
I thought we both agreed to stay away from her. - I know, but this was a special circumstance.
okay, forget me. If you wanna be with Serena, you gotta say something to Vanessa
no, it's not that. It's not that at all.
I mean, Serena and I were helping Blair.
We...investigate Chuck's new girlfriend. - Why would you do that?
because Eva's not who Chuck thinks she is.
that's...that's really all I can say. Blair made me promise.
so now... now your promises to Blair mean more than your pact with me?
or your relationship with Vanessa?
Nate, she's a prostitute. - What?
and I don't mean in a gold digger-ish, Eva's into Chuck's money kind of way.
I mean she's, like, got a web page and a price list.
but you can't tell Chuck. Please, please don't tell Chuck.
Blair wants to deal with this on her own. - Yeah, I bet she does.
Hey, uh, I'll talk to you later, okay?
cookies were definitely a good idea.
I couldn't let you go back to Brooklyn without any nourishment.
I'm sorry you missed Dan.
mildly convincing.
you're a slightly better liar than Nate. But you did not see Dan at all, did you?
he's going through a hard time.
look, I don't mean to pry, but hard time or not, - why would Dan lie to you? - I don't know.
because he's looking for an excuse to get away and not deal with everything.
okay, so why not just go to Nate's like he said?
because Nate would probably see that he's upset and try to make him talk about it.
so he went to the one person he knew would be happy to help him avoid.
Serena. - I don't know what to do.
confronting Dan now will only push him further away.
well, if you ask me, the only way to stop this is to confront Serena.
and I know just where you can find her.
Nate Archibald has his "I hate to tell you this" face on.
blair's been looking into, uh, Eva's past.
well, we can't be too surprised about that, can we?
she found something.
Eva is... or, at least she was...
Chuck, she's a prostitute.
Nathaniel, I may be nice, but I'm still me.
you think I didn't already know this?
Oh! I...Of... of course you did.
look, I'm sorry. Um, just be careful, okay?
knowing Blair, she's gonna try and out this whole thing at the party later. All right?
I'm gonna go deal with this stuff.
you sure you don't want to keep me company?
Yeah, no, I-I- Vanessa just texted that she's gonna be out late with friends from school.
so I thought I'd catch up on some reading.
you guys really do need to talk at some point.
I know. Tomorrow.
we're gonna talk tomorrow.
Hey. - Hey, Dan. I know it's last minute but our conversation got interrupted earlier, and I wanna know if you wanna go with me to Chuck's charity thing.
we could talk. - Yeah. You know what? I'd love to.
perfect. See you later.
what do you think?
you know.
do you see Serena? - I'm sure she's around here somewhere.
let's take a lap.
we're gonna go to the ladies room.
will you check this? - Sure.
thank you.
where are you? I need to see you
okay, where's Chuck?
I don't know. But, B.don't you think you should give him a few minutes to enjoy his event before you blow up his world?
fine. Where's Dan?
I don't know, but I know he'll show up. - You two look gorgeous!
thank you. So do you, - though I do question your manila evening bag.
Oh, well, uh, the Paris police sent me Charles' effects about a week ago - money clip, passport. You know, I just keep forgetting.
his valet is right over there. He'll drop it off in Chuck's suite for you.
wonderful. Thank you.
Chuck, look right. Chuck! Chuck! Chuck!
that'll be enough of that for one evening.
thank you. - I'll see you in a minute.
Chuck. - Blair. So how's the humiliation gonna go down?
did your scheme team find Eva's pimp?
is he gonna roll up to the press with platforms on? - No.
well, maybe you'll project a sex tape of Eva and one her Johns as I make my way up the dais?
Chuck, I'm not trying to humiliate anyone.
I just wanted you to know the truth, but obviously you already do.
Yes, and I don't care. - How can you not care?
this is your mother all over again.
you're giving your heart to a money-grubbing harlot who only cares about herself.
please don't do this.
you just can't stand to see someone finally change me, and it wasn't you.
well, if you believe that, then you really have changed, because now you're a fool!
that dress is not fair.
Dan. I'm so glad you came.
there are actually some things that I wanna tell you.
well, good, because there's some things I wanna tell you.
Oh, isn't that just adorable?
Hi. There you are.
what are you still doing with my coat? I thought you said... - Ben needs to see you.
Nate, you don't understand. - Oh, the reason I've- -I've never been to your apartment, the reason you're so hard to make plans with.
you have a boyfriend. - Ben's not my boyfriend.
you know, you hate Serena so much 'cause you're exactly like her.
Hey. - No, don't. Just... just go.
Serena had nothing to do with any of this. Really, we're just - we're friends.
if that was true, you wouldn't have lied.
Vanessa, I'm sorry, but I-I had fun today for the first time in a really long time.
good for you, Dan. I'm...
I'm glad that Serena's so fun, and I'm sorry that I'm not, that I'm just trying to make you deal with your feelings, with your life.
every second of every day. - I'm trying to help you, because that's what adults do in an adult relationship.
but if you wanna run around and be with miss fun-all-the-time, that's your choice.
but you better make sure she's choosing you, too.
did she tell you why she didn't call you all summer?
or explain to you why she texted you and Nate the same day she was coming back?
I've always only wanted you, Dan, but even I have my limits.
take care. - How'd it go with Dan?
well, Vanessa showed up, so they're talking now.
I don't know what's gonna happen, but I feel terrible.
how'd it go with Chuck? - He knew, but he didn't care.
well, I guess that's good news then, right, - if you were just doing this to protect him? - Yeah.
you don't want him back, do you?
I'll never forgive him. I just wanted to save him.
why don't I get you another drink?
thank you for understanding.
I didn't judge your past. I should've known you wouldn't judge mine.
I understand more than you know. Just don't lie to me again.
on behalf of the Manhattan philanthropic community, thank you, all, for coming.
now I know we're all dying to hear Chuck's announcement.
so without further ado... Mr. Bass.
Thanks, Kick.
when, uh, selecting a charity for my donation, there were so many worthwhile causes, I was confounded.
then I realized there was one person who would know the answer...
someone who had turned her life around and helped me turn around my own.
tonight, I'd like to announce a new charity...
the Eva Coupeau foundation.
I will be donating $5 million to the woman whose name it bears.
it is at her discretion to decide who deserves the help most.
she fell in love with me when she didn't know that I was Chuck Bass.
and tonight, I show her who that man really is.
so... Introducing mademoiselle Eva Coupeau.
Ivan, I'm gonna need to see that envelope lily gave you.
I think I left something in it.
thank you. I don't know what to say.
this is so unexpected. But Chuck put his faith in me...
Thanks.
Eva, would you mind if I had a word with Chuck? It's important.
why not, Blair? What more can you possibly do to me? - Be right back.
what do you want now, to tell me Nate's running a secret drug ring?
well, if he was, you'd probably make him the C. E.O. of Bass Industries. - You have 20 seconds.
I thought finding out your honey was a hooker would be enough to sway you, but you've just rewarded her for her tricks.
pun intended. - 14 seconds.
I didn't wanna tell you because I didn't wanna break your heart, - but after hearing your little speech, I feel like I have no choice. - 7 seconds.
you said Eva didn't know who you were when she fell in love with you.
but today when we went back to your room, I saw something that proves she did.
I don't believe you, Blair. - Deny all you want.
then I'd avoid the inside pocket of her suitcase. - What were you doing in her suitcase?
snooping, looking for dirt. But I never thought I'd find your passport.
that's impossible.
when I woke up, my passport was gone. The muggers took it.
or Eva did the night she found you.
the night she made you her mark.
Hey, have you seen Chuck? - No.
you okay? You look a little upset.
I think I just broke up with Juliet.
I mean, I know you hate her. - Doesn't mean that I wanna see you hurt.
you need to talk?
you came here with Dan, huh? - Yeah, I did.
Nate, if you ever need me...
I'm here, always.
I'm sorry. I really am.
I just thought you should know. - Chuck.
there you are.
I'll give you two a minute.
what is it? What's wrong?
did you know who I was when we met? - You know I didn't.
why are you asking me this? - I found my passport in your suitcase.
what are you talking about?
I should've known. You lied about the watch.
you lied about your former career. - Is that what you think of me?
I let you in, told you everything...
the whole story of how my mother and my uncle tried to take me.
you sat there and you thought, "I'm next."
I'm sorry.
I'll pack my things.
only the things you came with.
you okay? - I'm stupid.
how could I ever believe someone good would actually love me?
so what happened with Vanessa? - I saw you talking to Nate.
Yeah, he was having some problems.
listen, when you texted me from Paris that you wanted to talk,
I thought it must've been because, you know, you were...
you were thinking about the night before you left, like I have. - Well, I had been.
when you came back, I thought seeing Georgina and the baby must've changed things.
I also knew that you texted Nate, but I assumed it was to tell him it was over.
I guess that's what I wanted to believe, though. It's not the truth, is it?
well, there was a lot of unfinished business between all of us.
I need to know. When you came home, were you coming home to me or him?
honestly, Dan, I was trying to choose.
Serena, there are some people who don't need to choose.
Charles, thank you for a lovely evening. I am so proud of you.
and I had Ivan put your things in your room. - What things?
um, the package from the Paris police.
your personal effects, passport, that they sent last week.
Uh-oh, Chuck. Looks like "B" stands for betrayal.
Charles, are you okay?
can you catch your angel before she flies away?
Eva, stop it. Look, I'm so sorry.
I-I should never have doubted you. I made a terrible mistake.
you did, and thank you for saying that.
look, you are pure and perfect. I will make this up to you, I promise.
Chuck, I have to go. - No, look, you don't.
Blair set us up. I know better now.
of course Blair lied to you. She's a liar.
but you chose to believe her.
you're still connected to her.
I see it when you're together. I can...
I can feel it when I'm in the room. - So let's go away.
just you and me. Let's go back to Paris, wherever you want, right now.
you'll always feel the pull of New York. This is your home.
and now it's time for me to return to mine.
don't leave. Everybody leaves.
you're Chuck Bass, and that means something different now.
don't forget it, and don't forget me.
Nate, you're right. I have been lying.
Ben's my brother, and he's...Troubled.
he takes a lot of time and energy and has caused a lot of problems in every relationship that I've ever had.
look, I want to tell you everything. I'm just...
I'm not ready yet.
but I promise you, I won't let him come between us again.
well, I don't know if you've read anything about the Archibalds, but we have a lot of skeletons in our closets.
and we have mansions full of closets.
so I guess...
I can deal with one brother.
maybe I can show you my apartment now?
Hey. - I-I didn't think you'd still be here.
Yeah, I put my stuff in these boxes, and then I realized I don't have anywhere to go.
Vanessa, I don't want you to go anywhere.
you were right about everything. Serena is...
she's Serena. And I...
I was just avoiding you and avoiding myself.
it's a really weird, embarrassing thin for a college guy to be admitting, but I...
losing Milo broke my heart.
I know.
mine, too.
I love you.
and I don't regret any of the decisions that I made about Milo or having you here with me.
no Dan? And in that dress? I'm shocked.
I guess it's for the best, though.
I mean, if I end up with Dan, a part of me will always love Nate.
and if I end up with Nate, a part of me will always love Dan.
so I don't know. I guess I just need to find someone who gives me what I get in both of them.
that's a mature decision.
not sure I've made any of my own for a while.
what do you mean? - Miss Blair, Mr. Chuck is here.
I know what you did, Blair. It's despicable, even for you.
do you hate me so much you can't stand to see me happy? - No.
so why did you drive the person I care most about out of town?
Eva left? Chuck, I never meant to... - make her leave me?
of course you did. I need to know why.
is it possible you still love me?
how could I still love you after what you did? - So you did it just to hurt me.
Eva made me into someone I was proud to be.
you just brought back my worst self.
this means war, Blair. - Chuck...
me versus you. No limits.
ms. Sharp, wait. I have that package for you.
hold the elevator for me.
the owners will be back tomorrow.
in the prestigious buildings of Manhattan's elite, sometimes the door we open belongs to someone else.
why, thank you.
I'll have these cleaned for you in the morning, sir.
I ran into miss Eva. She said she was leaving.
I'm sorry. She'll be missed.
Ivan, you're fired.
and sometimes we let someone in, only to be left out in the cold.
yet sometimes, despite what we may want, the door just has too many locks.
X. O.X. O.Gossip Girl.
gossip Girl here.
your one and only source into the scandalous lives of the Manhattan's elite.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Are you kidding me? - Hey, you again.
tell me why you're drinking alone, and I'll you anything you want.
I thought I could start over, but it turns out college is just high school with more expensive books.
now I'm in with Serena, and I can find something even bigger to take her down with.
I better not find out that this was about protecting Nate.
if you're falling for him... - I'm not.
you sure about this?
the Captain is being charged with embezzlement and fraud.
there's a different way to get our lives back, dad, one that doesn't require another felony.
you be a man and you turn yourself in.
the moment you slept with Jenny Humphrey...
that was the best thing that ever happened to me because I got over you.
if that's the truth, then why haven't you told anyone about Jenny?
you wouldn't.
I need to get an interview for someone who will be applying to Parsons.
her name's Jenny Humphrey.
Hello?
somebody there?
who's there?
I know it's you, Chuck!
help! Somebody help!
they say waking up is hard to do...
especially when you're not alone.
what have we here?
bed unslept in, hair in missionary disarray, and yesterday's dress with today's shame all over it.
no shame.
for your information, we just stayed up talking all night.
so does this chatty insomniac have a name?
Colin. The cab stealer.
well, you showed him.
it turns out he actually has some redeeming qualities.
he's handsome in an old Hollywood way. He's smart.
and even though he's a businessman, he's more interested in talking about Lichtenstein and Warhol, which he collects, by the way.
so what are you doing here?
he also collects women that he puts into cabs... a new one each morning...
and I'm not gonna be one of them. I won't be.
what's wrong with you? You look exhausted.
I had another Chuck nightmare. It was awful.
I was in wait until dark.
and I knew that he was there, just lying in wait like in real life.
but then when he attacked me, he turned out to be a she.
like Chuck in drag or an actual girl?
I don't know! I was blind.
well, it makes sense you're dreaming about being attacked ever since Chuck declared war.
I guess. But then why a girl?
and that hair... so long and...
B.hey, can we talk about this on our way to school?
without the cab stealer, I have no excuse for being late for a class, and I promised the dean I'd be a model student.
I'm gonna meet you there.
there's something I need to do first.
okay.
Hey, man. What are you doing up so early?
just visiting my dad. Thought I'd check in. You okay?
Yeah, well, Vanessa went to stay with her folks for a while so...
sorry, man. Probably for the best, though, right?
Yeah, I suppose.
I guess part of her just believes that I'll always be in love with Serena no matter what I say.
Yeah. Crazy.
so, uh, what about you? How was your big night with Juliet?
totally worth the wait. At least I thought so.
huh? What do you mean?
this morning, she bolted. She said she couldn't skip class.
so? - So I thought she'd want to hang.
you know, maybe have breakfast at Tom's, stay in bed all day. I don't know.
right, well, I'm gonna ignore the fact that you have the best problems ever, and tell you just not to read too much into it.
I know this might come as a shock, but maybe she didn't want to skip class.
all right. I gotta go. Talk to you later.
Hey.
so the campus crusade continues?
you haven't punished Blair enough for driving Eva away?
as I told her, I've hardly begun. Besides, I actually like it here.
from what I hear, they've got someone big to replace Martha for the psychology of business lecture.
apparently, he's fortune 500.
I'm curious to meet the man, see what lessons there are to be learned.
speaking of, where's Blair?
don't tell me she threw in the towel after just one round?
she'll be here.
if you'll excuse me, I'm going to sit with them.
from what I hear, badminton players know how to handle a shuttlecock.
hold the door, please.
Colin. Hey. What are you doing here?
this is psychology of business, right?
Yeah, but...
Oh, no. Don't tell me you're... - The new professor.
I take it from your less than glowing enthusiasm that you are now one of my...
students. Yes.
they say life is full of surprises, that our dreams really can come true.
Hello?
then again, so can our nightmares.
anybody there?
welcome home, Jenny Humphrey.
we've missed you.
Blair, whatever you're about to do, my dad and Lily are gonna be home any minute.
not to worry, Little J.
this is going to be a very short conversation.
I let you walk away after you whored yourself out to Chuck because I assumed you were smart enough never to come back.
I might've been willing to make exceptions for holidays, birthdays, health emergencies of immediate family members, but I don't believe any of those scenarios apply.
Blair, I'm just here for one day. I have an interview with Tim Gunn, and if everything goes well, then he'll write me a recommendation letter for Parsons.
parsons is still in Manhattan, is it not?
lower Manhattan. It's a hundred blocks away from the Upper East Side...
semantics. You were banished.
if people think I'm not a woman of my word, the whole system could break down.
look, Blair, I'm not looking to destabilize your social order.
you know how much fashion means to me, and Parsons is the school for it.
I'll call you a car to take you back to Hudson and wait while you pack.
how about a day pass?
I promise I'll leave directly after my interview.
and, you know, who knows if Tim Gunn's even gonna like my work?
but either way, I promise I won't set foot in Manhattan for the rest of the year, not even Christmas.
Jenny-free holiday season.
it's been on my wish list for quite some time.
amnesty till midnight. - Thank you.
I'm not done. There are terms.
see no one, speak to no one, and don't step foot outside this apartment except for your interview.
fine. - Good-bye, Little J.
I look forward to never seeing you again.
so... Running into each other at a prison.
that's... kind of awkward.
Yeah, especially because you said you were going to class.
were you following me or something?
no. No, I wasn't following you, okay?
I'm visiting my dad. He's in for fraud and embezzlement.
he just got transferred down from upstate.
Oh, my God. Why didn't you tell me?
well, it's usually not a part of my "a" game pillow talk.
I mean, it was in all the papers. I thought you might know, and... and I wouldn't have to talk about it.
no, I-I didn't.
I'm sorry. I wasn't living in the city then.
no, it's okay. It's nice to actually have someone to talk to who might understand.
so who are you here for? Your brother you were telling me about?
no. I'm a volunteer...
for the prison literacy program.
why didn't you just tell me that this morning?
look, all I wanted to do was stay in bed with you, and...
I don't know. I guess I just felt weird bailing on you for some convicts.
like you said, not exactly the best pillow talk.
well, I think it's great you do something like that.
all right, I gotta get going before my dad wonders where I am.
but, um, is it cool if I swing by later, check out your class?
Oh, no. Um...
I just got a text message saying that my session was canceled.
I'll see you back in the city? - Okay.
Hey. You are never going to believe who's back in town. What's wrong?
our new psychology of business professor is Colin, the guy from last night.
cab guy? What are the odds?
I can't believe this is happening.
I'm already on thin ice with the dean. What am I supposed to do?
nothing. You make sure that he knows that there will be no more cuddling or art talk and that you expect to be treated exactly the same as if the two of you had never met.
I really like him, though.
but I'll talk to him.
office hours! Not his apartment!
Bye. - Bye.
did you happen to know that Jenny Humphrey was back on my island?
Really? She must have a lot of nerve, considering you banned her from the city.
if people found out she defied you...
they won't. And let me remind you, I sent her packing for both of our sakes.
if it was ever made public that you had a dangerous liaison with a teenage Brooklynite who also technically is your stepsister, you'd be socially guillotined.
well, I'd be mad to have anything to do with her return then, wouldn't I?
Arthur, pull the car around. It's time to make the stop I requested.
reporting for duty!
I need you three little pigs to huff and puff over to the Van Der Woodsens'.
you're on stakeout. Jenny Humphrey is back.
she's violating your order to exile?
I gave her a day pass, but she is not to move one inch outside that building without me knowing. Got it?
nothing could be more entertaining than bottle blonde recon.
but we'll still dying to know why you deported Jenny in the first place.
yours is not to wonder why.
yours is to do or die. Go!
I can't believe I didn't know you were coming back.
well, I'm only here for a day. I didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
if dad put out a spread like this every time you came home, I'd be inviting you more often.
thanks?
well, these are so lovely. I can see why Tim Gunn is dying to meet with you.
are you kidding? He knows what I do.
parsons would be lucky to have her.
Hey, how about, uh, dinner at Babbo tonight, celebrate us all being back together?
I'd actually kinda rather stay in, if that's okay. Um, dad's chili?
what? When have you ever passed up Babbo?
Yeah, I know, but I have a, um, a couple finishing touches to do on my dresses, so if you guys will excuse me...
I'm sorry, Rufus, but the chili... the smell, it lingers.
what? Must be the cumin.
okay, so what's really going on?
well, Blair stopped by with her welcome wagon.
I don't know why I thought I could sneak back in for a day, but...
well, how did she know you were here before I did?
she's the wicked witch of the Upper East Side.
you know, I'm sure one of her monkeys spotted me getting off the train or something.
but it's fine. She's giving me a day pass as long as I don't see or talk to anyone.
that's ridiculous.
Yeah, it is 100% vintage crazy-ass Blair.
but really, though, I mean, I have no interest in going back to being G.I. Jenny and warring with Blair.
how very Gandhi of you.
but in case eastern philosophy does fail you, how about I meet you downtown after my class and I can escort you back up here?
Thanks, but really, the only person I have to worry about today is Tim Gunn.
Hello? Is anybody home?
it's all right. I'll deal with him.
what are you doing here, Chuck?
I heard Jenny was back. I wanted to speak with her.
and say what? "I'm sorry for taking advantage of you "and letting my psycho ex-girlfriend run you out of town"?
something like that, except without the sarcasm.
Yeah, well, I think I can deliver that message, and I think you can find the elevator.
Oh, how can I argue with Big Brother?
I'll just grab these blueprints Lily left for me.
I'll let you get back to your Hemingway complex.
you know, I almost respect this side to you, Humphrey.
tell Jenny I said hello, and I'm truly sorry.
Hey.
Oh. You raced out of class pretty fast. Was I that boring?
come to think of it, you raced off pretty fast this morning as well.
well, I know the routine. I wanted to save you the effort of walking me out and hailing me a cab.
does that mean you think last night was a mistake?
the opposite, actually.
I had a lot of fun last night, which is why I didn't want you to think I was one of your usual conquests.
you made that pretty clear last night when you declined to be conquered.
all of this, however, was before I found out you were my professor.
and relationships with faculty are strictly forbidden, and I-I don't want last night to affect how you treat me as a student.
I've gotta say, that didn't sound very heartfelt.
wanna try it again with a little more conviction?
I've said what I needed to say. You can have the T. A. mark my papers.
may I offer a counterproposal?
I have to go to this party tonight for "the New York observer."
I'm getting some kind of eligible bachelor award. Will you come with me?
wouldn't bringing a date make you ineligible for an award like that?
maybe having you on my arm would be honor enough.
if I give up my bachelor title and commit to getting to know you better, maybe you could put off mastering the Psychology of business for another semester?
well, it's not like business is my major.
and it's still the add/drop period, so...
I'll pick you up.
the messenger's picking them up so that the models can get fitted, okay?
of course. I tell him extra careful, special delivery.
all right. Thanks, Vanya.
why are you calling me?
I understand your reluctance to ever speak to me again.
and I don't wanna bother you.
I was picking up some Bass Industries blueprints earlier, and it seems I mistakenly took your portfolio.
Chuck, I don't know what type of game you're playing, but my interview's in an hour.
you have to bring it back right now.
I would, of course, but I'm heading into a meeting I can't reschedule.
can you swing by the Empire?
No! I'm not supposed to go anywhere but my interview, and I definitely can't see you.
so you won't have to.
I left it at the front desk with my concierge. Good luck today.
no, Chuck!
spotted... B.'s disciples hot on Little J.'s tail.
go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! - This is fun.
and hopefully it's about to get more so.
follow that cab!
don't tell me you lost her.
watch out, J. break a deal with the devil...
we didn't. She just walked into the Empire.
I need the address of Tim Gunn's studio.
and there will be hell to pay.
Dan, you didn't have to meet me here. Besides, I'm already late.
I was in the neighborhood. But this is Veronica, and she was out here waiting for you.
Oh, sorry. Hi. I'm Jenny Humphrey.
I had a couple last-minute organizational issues.
no problem, Jenny. But the models are already inside getting dressed, and Mr. Gunn is on a very tight schedule today.
wish me luck? - I don't have to.
I mean, admittedly, you're my sister, and I love you, so I'm biased.
but if you can take Blair in stride today,
tim Gunn will be a piece of cake. Don't tell him I said that.
okay. Thank you.
all right. I'll be out here waitin' for ya.
collect call from a correctional facility. Do you accept these charges?
Yes. Ben, I'm so glad you called.
where were you today? - I came, but Nate...
I thought I told you to stop seeing him.
his father's in prison with you.
what? Don't they make you do your homework at Columbia?
I did, but he just transferred, and I bumped into Nate outside.
don't worry. I made something up.
you're wrong about him, you know.
I mean, we... we talked.
and he's not like the others. He might actually understand.
understand what exactly?
that your big brother's in prison? Maybe.
but what happens when he starts asking questions about why?
you think he's gonna understand then?
I don't know. I just...
I don't want to lie to him anymore.
maybe you're right.
I've put a lot on you. You're my little sister.
you deserve to be happy.
thank you... For understanding.
all right, I've gotta get back, but I'll call you later.
Hey, you know a new guy in here, last name Archibald?
introduce me?
winner! Colin Forrester - Hey, mom. - Serena! What a lovely surprise.
what brings you back to the homestead?
don't tell me word reached you that Rufus is making his famous chili.
Jenny's in town.
guess she forgot to call.
well, I know you two haven't exactly been the best of friends in the past, but maybe that can change now that you've had some time apart.
well, as much as I would love to bond with her, I actually have plans...
special plans that involve me raiding my mother's jewelry box.
those are special plans. Well, let's see what we can do.
Hey, what are you reading?
it's just a book by one of my professors. But I'm...
winner!" By Colin Forrester. "A must-read for 21st century C. E.O. S.
Serena, I can't tell you how happy it makes me to see you taking such a challenging course just right out of the gate.
honestly, after the year that you've had, it's wonderful to see you thinking about your future instead of focusing on boys.
Thanks, mom.
all right, let's go find something that sparkles, huh?
I must say, Jenny, this is a very impressive resume, especially for someone so young.
thank you. I... yeah, fashion's pretty much the only thing I've ever cared about.
so you interned with Eleanor Waldorf. Love her.
then you left to start your own line. That was bold.
Yeah, in retrospect, it was probably a little too bold.
I didn't exactly leave on great terms, and then my new business partner set all of my dresses on fire, so...
Oh, my. But you must've patched things up with Eleanor because I see you worked together again last year.
and then you just left town?
well, there was a-a conflict with a different Waldorf.
but I can assure you that all of that's behind me now.
I think that these dresses really express my take on young women today...
our sense of self-confidence and self-worth.
well, let's take a look. - Okay.
whore - This is quite a statement, Jenny. - Um, no...
we're done.
that part is not... - Let's get ready for the next appointment.
no, I'm... - Confidence and self-worth?
I don't know if this is your idea of a joke, but it's not funny.
it's not a joke. I'm so sorry. This isn't how...
I'll show you the way out. - Mr. Gunn, please...
ladies, you may leave.
Blair, uh, I don't know what you're doing here, but whatever it is, it's not gonna work,'cause Jenny's already inside.
I came for the after party.
Blair! How could you?!
Jenny, wait. What... what happened?
she totally humiliated me and destroyed my collection.
you broke the terms of our agreement. Here. There's a 5: 00.
spotted... Little J. having a fashion emergency.
looks like B. drew blood.
before you say anything, I'm only calling because I saw "Gossip Girl."
I wondered if I might be able to offer some assistance.
well, unless it's a murder-suicide, I think I'll pass.
so dramatic. You should be a writer.
tim Gunn is being honored at "The Observer's" new yorkers of the year party tonight at the boom boom room.
why don't you two accompany me?
surely Jenny can find a quiet moment to plead her case.
and why should I actually believe that you're trying to help us here?
it would be my way of making amends to Jenny.
why don't you run it by the brains of the operation?
I can't imagine her wanting Blair to win this one.
Chuck can get us into "the observer" party, and Tim Gunn's gonna be there.
well, it's not like Blair can do anything worse to me.
but what about dinner with dad?
tell your sister I'll leave tickets for the whole family.
I look forward to seeing you at the festivities.
careful, Little J. Queen B. doesn't grant second chances.
she attacks at first sight.
you look incredible. - Thank you.
maybe we should walk in separately.
you having second thoughts?
no. No, no. I just... I talked to my mom today, and she's so proud of me for taking your class.
I don't want her to read that I'm dropping it in "The New York Times."
well, why don't you just tell her?
because she'll think I'm choosing a man over my future again.
you know what? If it's okay with you, I'm just gonna meet you upstairs.
Rufus. - Hey, Jared, great.
good to see you. - You are a vision.
thank you both for coming. - Pleasure to be here.
are you sure this is a good idea? I mean, R.I. S.D. Has a great fashion program.
we are not letting you give up on Parsons. Come on.
I-I have a Blair-shaped target on my back.
you want to be Gandhi? Now's your chance.
let's go find Tim Gunn.
mom, hey! - What are you doing here?
what happened to Chili night?
change of plan. Uh, Dan and Jenny wanted to come, so we all did.
great.
is that your professor? - Who?
Colin Forrester. I recognize him from his jacket photo...
which, incidentally, does not do him any justice.
one more, Colin.
mom, about that... I know, how important it is to you that I take his class...
it's not the class I care about.
I am just so proud of the student you're becoming, your new focus.
I know, but just... - Serena, I ducked the press line.
tell your mother that I am crazy about you, that I might be your future, and I don't care who knows.
sorry. Colin Forrester.
Lily Humphrey, formerly Van Der Woodsen. Serena's mother...
who heard everything loud and clear.
status report.
Jenny didn't get on the train. She's at "the observer" party. We followed her here.
we followed her here.
this isn't just belligerency. It's insurgency.
why would she risk escalating my wrath?
tim Gunn is here.
of course. An eleventh hour appeal.
don't let her out of your sight. I'm on my way.
well, the boom boom room is a private club, and we're having trouble with the door guy. Can you help?
Penelope, this isn't congress. Accomplish something.
ladies. Good to see you.
...all on a go-see, see who you like, who you'd like to have through the line, and, um, if that works out for you, we could...
Mr. Gunn? Hi. Jenny Humphrey.
Jenny. Of course.
um, I'm... I'm really sorry to bother you. I just...
I didn't get a chance to explain earlier that my dresses weren't supposed to be like that, with the... the paint and the letters.
Oh, dear. What happened?
I-it's a long story. But, um, I just...
I really needed you to know that that's not who I am or what my work's about.
and I would really do anything for a second chance.
I think I can arrange for another interview.
and don't let your dresses out of your sight.
all right. Thank you.
you know, when Veronica told me that Chuck Bass wanted us to meet...
wait. Chuck called you?
Really? No inmates by that name?
all right. Well, um, thank you.
Hey. - Hi.
what is it? - I know this sounds a little crazy, but after our talk this morning, I thought maybe your brother was an inmate, and you were just too embarrassed to tell me, so I called over there.
you called the prison?
Yeah, and I'm sorry. I was just being paranoid, and it's not an excuse, but I have a history of believing girls when I shouldn't.
I just wanna make sure we're totally open with each other.
I know. I-I want the same thing.
in fact...
that's why I came over.
there are some things that I need to tell you about me, and... and my family.
wait one second. It's the prison. Hello?
Yes.
wait, wait. What?
are you sure? Of course. I'll come right over.
is everything okay?
no. My dad's been jumped by some inmates, and he's in the infirmary.
Nate. - I gotta go. I'll call you later, okay?
Ben: Did you get my message?
Hi! - It is wonderful to see you.
so good to see you. - Of course you're being honored tonight.
thank you. - Rufus, this is Isaac Mizrahi.
Hello, Isaac. - Hello.
Jenny, hey. I saw you walk away from Tim Gunn. What happened?
just like old times, huh, J?
what are you guys doing here?
question is, what are you doing here?
or do you want that dress messed up, too?
leave me alone.
we don't make the rules, J. We just enjoy enforcing them.
but there is one thing we don't understand...
what a pathetic nobody like you could've done to Blair Waldorf to get her so riled up we had to play follow the loser all day.
wait. You guys don't know why Blair hates me?
besides the obvious? No one does.
blair's here. You're in trouble now.
we'll see who's in trouble.
Jenny. Jenny, whatever you're thinking of doing...
they won't stop. Why should I?
move! I have a Humphrey to squash.
looking to paint the town red?
I don't know what you've heard, but it isn't your concern.
unless...
it is.
you've been behind this the whole time, haven't you?
you got Jenny the interview with Tim Gunn, and you made sure that your friend-with-no-benefits stopped by the Empire just to defy me.
I told you I wouldn't rest until you were destroyed.
inviting your old sparring partner back was just my way of avoiding doing all the dirty work myself.
Jenny always had a talent for making your life a living hell.
you've gone too far.
bringing Jenny back puts both of our reputations at risk.
I love to watch you squirm.
the pleasure I get from witnessing your shame is considerable.
but I doubt Jenny will talk.
she thinks she's above it all, but little Humphrey still cares what people think.
looks like New York's best kept secret is finally out.
turns out Little J. didn't lose her V. card to Damien Dalgaard.
she waited and chucked it away with her stepbrother.
guess that explains the Humphrey in Hudson.
hell hath no fury like a Waldorf scorned.
it's obviously not true.
Jenny put out the blast so that...
she would humiliate me. Tell them that she's lying.
give it up, Blair.
everyone knows I did and who I gave it to.
looks like the joke's on Chuck and Blair, and little J.'s got the last laugh.
Hey. You okay?
I'm not quite sure what just happened in there, but it... it, uh, seems all bad.
it's a matter of degree.
I mean, I'm a little embarrassed that the entire world knows I lost it to Chuck Bass.
but did you see their faces?
I mean, Blair looked like she might cry.
well, so much for zen Jenny Humphrey.
come on, Dan. I just did what needed to be done.
it's what Blair and Chuck would've done.
Jen, I was proud of you for moving on, but if this is what you've become after just a day back, maybe Blair was right after all, and maybe you should go back to Hudson.
I met Colin before he started teaching, but I'm gonna drop his class Monday so there aren't any further problems.
Serena, please, you don't need to apologize. I get it.
wait. You're not mad at me?
well, I understand the lure of a powerful man like Colin.
I married Bart Bass, remember? It's fine.
and to be honest, they can make your life so much easier.
well, it's not about that.
well, we both know you would have moved on to classes more your speed eventually.
you don't think I could've handled a business class?
well, we'll never know now, will we?
darling, I'm just trying to be supportive and realistic.
a pretty girl like you could get the attention of a Colin Forrester even without an education.
so why even bother?
Lil, I think you may have taken this tough love a little too literally this time.
well, um, after Serena left this afternoon, I bought Colin's book, and on chapter 16, it talks about reverse psychology.
nothing I've done so far has gotten through, so I thought I'd try something new.
dad. - Nate.
are you okay? What happened?
no idea. I was reading in the library one minute, and the next minute, somebody was taking batting practice with a dictionary.
do you know who it was? Do you have a problem with someone?
I've never seen 'em before.
Hey. Are they giving you anything?
no. Don't worry. I'm still on the wagon.
I told 'em nothing stronger than a Tylenol.
did you let your mother know?
Yeah. I let her know.
I'm sure if she knew how bad it was, she would come down.
Nate, it's okay. I gave up on your mother visiting a long time ago.
this wasn't exactly what she signed up for.
Yeah, well, whatever happened to "in good times and bad"?
I don't know. I spent most of our marriage focused on "for richer or poorer."
I just wish she could see how great you're doing now...
present situation excluded.
now you can see it. That's enough for now.
nothing I can do about the rest till I get parole.
well, just try and stay safe until then. You know, no reading.
tell me again about that girl you like.
thank you, Jared, and thank you, Ivanka, for marrying Jared and giving someone else the chance to win "bachelor" this year.
this is quite an honor, but one I would gladly give up for the right woman...
mom, let's go.
...if I'm ever lucky enough to meet her.
anyway, um, thank you all...
are you happy now that you've humiliated both of us?
check your own bloody hands, lady MacBeth.
what did you think would happen when you played "Carrie" with her dresses?
I only did it because you lured her back here to torture me.
I warned you I wouldn't stop.
and thanks to your vendetta, we both lost, and Jenny Humphrey won.
if you've come to gloat, I would relish the moment. It will be fleeting.
you're right, because I'm leaving.
despite what happened today, I can't beat you.
in order to beat you, I'd have to become you, and I'm better than that. At least I wanna be.
nice try, Jenny. We know that you're just scared and trying to save face.
you two used to be in love, and together you were invincible.
but now that you've turned against each other, it's just a matter of time before your mutual destruction.
and when that happens, maybe I'll think about coming home, but for now, good-bye, good riddance, and good luck.
we hear little J. gave Chuck and Blair a good-bye kiss... of death.
come in.
Hello?
Hey, what are you doing here?
I was just gonna leave a note under your door. It explains everything.
sorry. I thought you'd be out celebrating your bachelorhood, putting a new girl into a cab.
actually, I'm working on my lecture for Monday's class.
Really?
you got me thinking, if my class is so important to you, maybe I should try a little harder to make it worth your while.
fewer models and Martinis, more footnotes and flowcharts.
I know you need to figure out what you wanna do with your life, Serena.
I've been there. Believe me.
and if my course can help, that's great.
but it's only seven weeks.
Meaning?
we can still get to know each other...
as teacher and student.
by the book?
I'm willing to wait if you are.
well... then, teacher, I'll see you Monday.
and don't even think about leaving an apple on my desk.
you've got no shot at being teacher's pet.
seriously, Dan, you don't have to ride with me all the way to the border.
pretty sure I'm safe now.
besides, I'm leaving, like Blair wanted.
no, no, I'm not guarding you. I'm just, uh, just hanging out.
I'm really proud of you, Jen.
Thanks. Although I don't know if I'm ever gonna be able to come back to the Upper East Side without morphing into everything I hate about myself.
give it some time. Let your Brooklyn D. N.A. guide you to righteousness.
well, if it's your D.N.A. that I share, then maybe I have a chance.
Yeah.
thanks for being a good brother.
they say war's not the answer.
but sometimes it's a battle just to keep the peace.
if you're here to deliver any further humiliation, Dorota can sign for it.
Jenny was right.
if we keep going, we both end up dead, and I like myself too much to let that happen.
I assume you feel the same.
about myself? More. What do you suggest?
a truce.
why don't you just skywrite the word "double-cross"? It'd be more subtle.
look, we can keep blaming each other for what happened that night, or we can admit a harder truth...
it was no one's fault.
it was fate. Tragedy.
if Serena hadn't kissed Dan, then...
Nate wouldn't have been at the hospital looking for her, and Jenny wouldn't have come looking for Nate.
if Dorota hadn't gone into labor...
maybe everything would be different.
but it's not.
we're holding on to the pain because it's all we have left.
but we don't have to.
we have a choice.
truce.
you can see yourself out.
I know the way.
on the Upper East Side, you may stand down, but you can never give up.
and the bitterest feuds are always labors of love.
Hi. - Hi. I just got home.
can you come over? - I don't think so.
my dad's gonna be okay. Thanks for asking.
I'm glad, but, Nate...
but what?
Oh, God, this is so hard.
okay, well, let me make it easy for you.
you find out that Nate Archibald's dad's a jailbird, and you decide you can do better, or maybe you already have.
Nate, please, you're different than anyone I've ever known.
no, you know what? Just save it, okay?
cause you're exactly like everyone I've ever known.
I'm so sorry, but I have to go.
Hey, Juliet.
what's wrong? - Nothing.
I'm fine.
just a bad day.
I... I hope it's okay I poured myself a drink.
of course. I could use one, too.
I assume you are here for your check and not just to raid my liquor cabinet.
I'm sorry to be so predictable.
here. This should cover things.
how's it going?
you weren't kidding when you said it'd be a challenge.
well, all good things are worth waiting for, aren't they?
but our most dangerous enemies are the ones we never knew we had.
to patience.
so if you want peace, always be prepared for war.
X. O.X. O.Gossip Girl.
gossip Girl here.
your one and only source in the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
you two used to be in love. Together, you were invincible.
but now that you've turned against each other, it's just a matter of time before your mutual destruction.
truce?
now I'm in with Serena, and I can find something even bigger to take her down with.
where are you? I need to see you.
Ben's not my boyfriend.
please, you're different than anyone I've even known.
just save it, okay?
cause you're exactly like everyone I've ever known.
all good things are worth waiting for, aren't they?
our new psychology of business professor is Colin, the guy from last night.
cab guy? What are the odds?
relationships with faculty are strictly forbidden. - I'm willing to wait if you are.
well, then, teacher, I'll see you Monday.
rise and shine, Upper East Siders. It's officially fall.
and when the leaves start to turn, we know it's time for B.'s birthday.
we hope Serena will be there to celebrate, but we hear she's having her own private party with a professor.
so you're from Maine?
I grew up on a boat. Not a yacht. A trawler.
my family's in lobsters. - I love "The Deadliest Catch.
okay, so how did you get from there to here?
Yeah, it was all my dad. He never graduated high school, so he made sure I didn't make the same mistake.
and the rest of your family? - Still adrift, in more ways than one.
do I sense a little mystery there?
so you came from nothing and now here you are...
this big finance guy traveling the world with a killer art collection.
favorite book?
mergers, acquisitions, and corporate restructurings." Really?
you just became my next project.
tomorrow, we'll have a music and most embarrassing moments.
unless... - We can do this, Serena.
six more weeks.
I'll see you tomorrow.
happy to have you home, miss Eleanor.
you didn't think I would miss throwing my only childa 20th birthday party?
mother, you do know that my actual birthday isn't until next week, don't you?
23 hours of labor. I am not likely to forget.
Cyrus and I have tickets to the Palais Garnier.
so I thought, better an early birthday bash than a belated one.
it is a shame that the party will fall on the same night as Lily and Rufus' anniversary, but so goes event planning in Manhattan.
Cyrus sent you this present.
a signed copy of "This I Remember." What a fitting gift.
it is time that I claim my rightful role as power player on the world stage, just like little Nell did.
tonight's party is going to be as glamorous and sophisticated as its guest of honor.
Dorota, come.
we have just enough time for a dramatic reading of page one before I have to meet Serena.
so you seem pretty eager to get together this morning.
what? Your... your first anniversary's a big deal.
and I-I figured maybe you could use my help planning, and maybe I needed to get out of the house.
Vanessa just got back from the commune. - You guys talk?
Oh, if saying "hey" and "excuse me"counts as talking.
worst thing is, she... she tried to get back into campus housing, but, uh, the deadline past.
Oh, so now you're roomies with your ex.
Yeah. Hey, how would you and Lily feel about celebrating, uh, with a... with a nice family road trip?
actually, uh, we decided to order in tonight and just have a quiet evening alone.
Oh, I-I thought you said, um, it's really important to celebrate with the whole family.
we did, but Jenny has a big test she has to study for and can't make it back to the city.
and it doesn't feel right having a family celebration without her.
I know the first wedding anniversary's supposed to be paper, but that's not really an excuse to... to eat out of cartons.
we'll celebrate together some other time when Jenny's back home.
I'm gonna head off, find lil some flowers, try to make this special.
what class has a test on a Saturday?
that would be fear of Chuck and Blair 101.
and after the year we've had, I think it would mean a lot to my dad and Lily to get the family together.
there's... there's gotta be a way that we can get Jenny to come in, right?
maybe Chuck could help. - Right, like he did last time?
he loves my mom, and as long as Chuck and Blair are at war, he's on our side.
did you get a haircut? It looks different.
no, just happy, I guess.
well, if I know you, there's a guy at the end of that story.
well, I might be seeing someone... kind of.
what is he doing here? - What's she doing here?
and who brought the avon lady? - She's a court stenographer.
there's a notary on the way.
we've witnessed the WaldorfBass wars firsthand. We know you both.
you have nuclear capability.
sooner or later, one of you is gonna press the other's button, and we're gonna end up with nothing but cockroaches.
you know, we're way ahead of you. - Yeah, we're in a truce.
which is why we figured you wouldn't have a problem making it official...
a peace treaty based on more than just a handshake.
so that's why we're gonna sit down and hammer out the provisions of a cease-fire.
and if either of you decide to break the treaty... - He or she will be excommunicated.
we'll no longer be your friends.
well, I suppose as I leave my teens, that I should start to think about my legacy.
I have no objection to order in the kingdom.
let the negotiations begin.
if you give me the standard on weeknights, I'll give you the Carlyle for the entire Christmas season.
done, but I want an addendum that you can't bed hostesses from a roster of restaurants I frequent.
you can't have fashion week in both Paris and Milan. You have to choose.
never, but I will give you art basel in Miami and Switzerland.
okay, moving on to article 47...
strip clubs in the outer boroughs. - Sidebar.
why are we sidebar-ing? Do you really want access to strip clubs?
no, I just don't want to seem like I'm ceding territory too easily.
so pretend like we're talking about something serious, like my birthday, or have you figured out that anniversary situation?
B.what can I do? They're already planning a family thing.
Unacceptable... Just like that sex glow you're sporting.
there was no sex. Just coffee.
coffee is the thing you have before you pay the check to go have sex.
it's different. Colin is... - Our professor?
the one you promised to stay away from except where class is concerned?
which is why we're only meeting during office hours.
you are one macchiato away from making the same mistake that you always make, and I won't be an accomplice, especially not on my almost-birthday. Okay, fine, then I won't mention him anymore.
I cede the strip clubs.
then that concludes the treaty.
actually, there's one more point I want to negotiate... in private.
attorneys, you're dismissed.
well, I guess we know why Chuck didn't answer the phone.
of course Chuck and Blair go to war and end up happier than ever, leaving Jenny and our family in a pile of rubble.
Yeah, it figures. Rubble's their specialty.
although... peace time would be the perfect opportunity for a stealth strike.
Oh, come on. How good would it feel to finally give them a taste of their own medicine?
not that we're the ones to give it to them.
well, hold on a second. What's wrong with us?
I mean, I've picked up a-a few skills over the years, and you come from a long line of world-class schemers.
we have righteousness and our parents' anniversary on our side.
no offense, Dan, but we are no match for Chuck and Blair.
mm, I don't know about that.
seems like leaves aren't the only things changing colors this fall.
so that's it. The war is over.
no more blackmail, angry asides, or sadistic schemes.
we're not a couple. We're not at war.
we officially have no reason to interact beyond social niceties.
what a huge relief. - I guess this is good-bye.
let us not forget article 19... No touching. Take care, Chuck.
Serena! Hi - Hi.
Oh, are you picking up something for Blair's birthday?
a first edition? That's really thoughtful.
actually, Blair's getting a special delivery from Bergdorf's. This is for a professor.
that's an awfully nice gift for a professor.
you must really like his lectures.
or... that's not all you like.
I may have a small crush.
tell me everything!
I've been there myself, so no judgments, and my lips are sealed.
well, nothing's happened, and nothing's going to happen...
at least, not while he's my teacher. I would never put my academic future at risk.
then what are you doing?
just talking, getting to know each other until the semester's over.
the waiting is... Actually amazing.
Wow. That's great.
does he feel the same way? - What do you mean?
all books, no sex?
I-I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but he's a guy, and guys don't wait.
so if he's not getting it from you, then...
there's no way. He's, um... - different.
well, if not, I'm here for advice.
thank you. - You're welcome. Bye.
she has her eye on a professor
got it.
its genius is in its simplicity.
we break the truce, drive a wedge between them.
then once the peace is off, Chuck will be primed to help Jenny in retaliation.
okay, so what would enrage Chuck Bass? His maybe mother? His late father?
Jack Bass. - That's perfect.
gossip Girl will be thrilled to hear about a secret fling with Jack and Blair last summer in the south of France, or how they're planning to do it again this Christmas.
nice touch. Are you sure we aren't really related?
all right, so I run into Chuck, offer my condolences that Blair can't be trusted, suggest the best way to retaliate is offer amnesty to Jenny, and as an added bonus, my dad and Lily get the first anniversary they deserve.
let's see how strong the holy alliance is after this air strike.
Hello? - Surprise! It's me!
Serena, I don't think coming here is a good idea.
I'm just dropping off a copy of my favorite book, "The Beautiful and Damned.
where is she? I know she's up here.
Serena, meet... Ilana.
my housekeeper.
you, uh, were jealous of my housekeeper.
I saw you get her from a cab. - I always pay her cab fare.
stop smiling.
she's gorgeous, and I'm going a little crazy here. - I know. Me, too.
let's be honest. We may sit across from each other, talking about bagels versus brioche, but all we're thinking...
is what it would be like to have breakfast in bed?
okay, as much as it... it kills me to say this, no more office hours.
I just can't be alone in a room with you.
so other than class, I'll see you in six weeks.
other than tonight. The dean just e-mailed that my presence is requested at a party apparently at your place.
you're invited to Blair's birthday?
S.I can't talk now. - Did you invite the entire Columbia faculty to your party tonight?
I may have invited the dean and whomever she favors.
why do you care? You're not going.
well, the anniversary party was canceled, so yes, I am.
and now it turns out so is Colin.
unless you mean Firth or Farrell, I'm not listening, the dean will be there. Need I say more?
Chuck. Hey. Uh, hey, man. I was just stopping by to see Nate.
but I-I guess he's not here. - He's in his room.
Oh, he is? He's not... he's not at class? I would've thought...
you really don't know how to stage a run-in, do you? Cut to the chase.
well, uh, since Blair betrayed you with your uncle,
I thought maybe you could betray her back, call my sister, offer her protection.
well, you're just about six months late for that, aren't ya, Humphrey?
Hey, I,uh, I didn't expect to see you here. I assumed...
that Chuck and I would be back at war after that silly "Gossip Girl" blast?
it was obviously fake.
what gave you that idea?
we have enemies, Humphrey. All powerful people do.
we anticipated someone would try to mess with us.
and this handiwork has your lying little sister's fingerprints all over it.
besides, Jack Bass wasn't in France last summer. He was in Chile.
again, uh, how did you know that? - I must've read about it somewhere.
regardless, this incident inspired us to add a new addendum to the treaty.
the notary just left. - Now wait wait a second.
there... there... there's a treaty? Like an actual legal document?
Humphrey, the intricacies of our war games are too complex for prole like you to fathom.
as an additional gesture of trust, Chuck, - I would like to invite you to my birthday party this evening. - I gratefully accept.
and since Gothic Barbie remains safely quarantined upstate, feel free to stop by if you're feeling lonely.
Serena. Hey. - So it turns out you were wrong about the professor.
he is waiting for me. But waiting is not easy.
I don't trust myself to be in a room with him.
I'm sorry. Normally, I would talk to Blair about this, but she doesn't approve.
people are such prudes. - Yeah.
well, anyway, we agreed to stay away from each other, but tonight we both have to go to Blair's birthday, and a lot of faculty are going, including the dean.
the dean? No kidding.
I get it. What you need is a buffer...
someone to stay by your side, distract you, make sure you two are never alone all night.
I'm happy to help. Really? Thank you.
of course, although I'm not sure how Blair will feel about me being at her party.
well, you'll be my guest. And... and maybe it's a good idea.
she'll get to know the real you. Thank you.
my pleasure. You've put yourself in the right hands.
Juliet's plans are falling into place, and S. is primed for a fall.
Hey, man, do you know anything about, uh,
Chuck and Blair's so-called peace treaty?
Yeah, of course. It was my idea.
you know, they're really trying to change.
I highly doubt that, but do you by any chance know what's in it?
I'm sorry, man. I can't tell you that. I gave my word I'd guard it.
security's coming to pick it up and put it in the safe.
anyway, there's stuff in there Serena and I don't even know about.
Chuck and Blair made us leave early. - Wait a second. You saw Serena? I thought we agreed.
you don't have to worry about it, okay? She's seeing someone else.
can we talk about this later? I'm late for class. - Yeah.
Nate thought he and Humphrey were thick as thieves.
turns out Humphrey's a thief, and Nate's just thick.
just the man I was looking for. - Hey.
so I assume you're going to Blair's birthday party tonight?
Yep. Solo, now that things are over with Juliet.
that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about.
um, she's gonna be my date.
I thought she left me for someone else. I didn't know it was you.
come on. That guy I was telling you about...
uh, we're... we're trying to stay away from each other, and he's gonna be there tonight, so Juliet offered to chaperone so that I stay strong.
well, if all you need is a buffer, let me take you.
well, I don't want to make him jealous.
no, we're just friends. Let's be honest. It's better to have a guy protect you from another guy.
you do have a point. - I know I do, plus I'd rather not run into Juliet, so you'd be doing me a favor, too.
okay.
Juliet, hey. Uh, change of plans. I actually don't need your help anymore tonight.
are you sure? - Yeah, yeah, so you can go back to whatever it is - you away from doing. Thank you, though. - Yeah.
Bye-bye.
I need a favor...
you put gladiolas in my cabbage roses?!
the Waldorf's is not a best Western.
get them out.
darling, I just got off the phone with Rufus and Lily.
I told them if they can't be with family, they might as well be with friends.
we have to do something special for them.
I suppose powerful women can afford to be generous.
so I'll have to think of some kind of anniversary surprise. How's the guest list coming?
everyone's who's anyone will be here.
but I-I couldn't help but notice a certain Charles Bass has been added to the list.
Blair, we don't need any trouble. - He'll be no trouble, mother. He and I are good.
Yeah, so good you have been berating the help all day.
I'm not berating anyone! I just want to be sure that the party is perfect.
your dress, miss Blair. - Are you kidding?
what part of "J. Mendel" did you not understand? - Actually, dear, I picked it out.
Dorota... What's going on with me?
you aren't fighting with Mr. Chuck, so you fight with everyone else.
take it upstairs.
that's their biggest secret?
I-I was expecting something a little bit more "American Psycho..."
not stabbing a homeless man, but at least feeding a cat to an A. T.M.
a birthday surprise may be in order. I think all it'll take is a couple of calls.
look, Dan, I know we want Jenny to come in for the anniversary, but she fought back last week and nearly lost everything she learned.
you told her that yourself.
uh, maybe we shouldn't risk the same. - No, we should. They deserve it.
they're... they're... they're smug and they are condescending.
they have treaties. And we're doing it for Jenny.
Dan, we tried. It didn't work.
I'm out, and I-I-I hope you are, too.
Hi. Uh, hi. Rita. This is Dan, Rufus Humphrey's son.
Yeah, I hope you don't mind me calling, but, uh,
I have a very good friend with a birthday party tonight, and... and I was hoping I could get your help.
Yeah, do you still work at Interscope?
looks like Brooklyn's in it to win it.
just what is it exactly? Guess we'll find out tonight.
Zoe! - Hi, love.
now I know it's a party. - Oh, stop. You look... so chic.
Cheers. Thanks. - Hi. - Hi.
Hi.
Dean Reuther, I am so thrilled you could make it. - Happy Birthday, Blair.
the guest list is inspired.
thank you for inviting me... And my faculty.
well, thank you, and I hope you get a chance to chat with Patricia Ireland.
I think she'd be really interested in that paper you wrote for "Yale Law Review" on planned parenthood v. Casey.
you read that? - Of course.
every woman who cares about her right to choose should.
you know, Blair, I think another we should get to know each other better.
I'll have my assistant set up lunch.
O. M.G.
the last girl the dean took to lunch became C. E.O. of Pepsi.
here you go.
I was happy with eating shun Lee out of the carton, Lil.
this is all just very Upper East Side.
look, I know you think you're rock 'n' roll, but you are wearing a $2, 000 jacket.
happy anniversary...
Oh! Thank you. - To you!
that's a gorgeous... blazer.
thanks for getting me in, but I should go before anybody sees us together.
of course. Have fun.
that guy I told you about is here. Please distract me. - Okay.
don't look over there, but my lit professor... Look at his pants. Look at 'em.
I bet you 10 bucks they're held up with a rubber band. He wears them every single day. Yeah, it's ridiculous.
Dan, hey. I didn't realize you were coming.
Yeah, it was kind of a last minute thing.
I-I, uh, I didn't know you were coming together. - Oh, no. We're... we're not...
you know something? I'm gonna go... I'm gonna hit the cheese table. I'll see you later.
Serena. Hi.
so... this is your new buffer.
Yeah. I didn't know you were still coming.
I came with a friend. It's nice to see you two having fun.
Yeah, well, you're not exactly dying of loneliness.
Nate... Can you give us a moment, please? - Yeah.
I'm... I'm sorry. I hope it's not too awkward that I came with him.
I know things are difficult between you two right now.
no, it's okay. I'm... I'm not worried about Nate.
so... where is the mysterious professor?
hmm? Which one is he? - I'm not gonna tell you that.
Nate's gone off and left you alone.
how am I supposed to step in to be your backup if I don't know who to protect you from?
okay, but you can't tell anyone. - I could kill the caterer.
the appetizer tray looks like a Rorschach test.
you! You're... you're the one who did such a wonderful job at the fashion's night out.
come. Help me with those trays.
why are you talking to that horrible Juliet, and what are you doing here with Nate?
well, you'll be happy to know that Colin and I...
Hey! My ears don't register his name.
are trying to stay away from each other, which is why I brought Nate as a buffer.
and since you won't listen to my Colin problems, I had to go to Juliet for advice.
Serena, do you have amnesia? Juliet isn't your friend.
she's actually proven to be a pretty good friend since she saved me from Vanessa's takedown.
Oh, please, if I want to hear fiction, I'll go talk to Jonathan Franzen. In fact...
s- on! What are you doing here?- I could say the same to you.
I-I thought you were gonna be having your romantic night alone at home.
Eleanor convinced them to come celebrate among friends.
Oh, no. But... but... but you... but you can't stay here. It'd be bad luck.
you know, everything here is on China and crystal. You gotta...
you gotta go home and celebrate on paper plates as planned.
you know, I am surprised that you are so superstitious, Dan.
let's face it. Our plan to stay at home was pretty depressing.
Yeah, let's go check out those cookies in the shape of Blair's shoes. - Okay.
Hey, why... why... why didn't you warn me they were coming?
I didn't think I needed to. Oh, you didn't actually go through with it, did...
Oh, you did. Uh, okay. Can... can... can you put a stop to it before it's too late?
you look lovely tonight.
it's so cold in here. I can barely feel my fingers.
cold? I'm practically feverish. I must tell Dorota to turn up the air.
just one thing before you go. I was wondering... how did you know where Jack was?
I think I must have read it online. - That's strange. Last I heard, he was off the grid.
well, if you'll excuse me, I'm entertaining.
good to see you, Serena. I better go find Eleanor before she wonders why I haven't said hello.
good to see you, too, Cynthia. - Nice meeting you.
okay, see? That was a great distraction, right?
what are you look... what are you looking at? He's flirting with someone.
don't look at him. Look at me.
okay, remember when Mrs. Salazar made us memorize the Gettysburg address?
look at me and recite it. Just do it. Just go. - What?
four score and... and... and seven years ago... - Okay.
our fathers... - Don't flair your nostrils at me.
brought to this continent, a new nation, uh...
keep going. You're doing well. - "Conceived in liberty...
and dedicated to the proposition That you are an incredible chaperone. - I know.
Oh, hi, darling. - Nate, Serena, hello.
Hey, happy anniversary. I'm so glad we can all be together. - Oh, thank you, darling.
well, it looks like you're in good hands now. I'll catch up with you later.
excuse me. Uh, you wouldn't happen to be Ben, would you?
I'm sorry? - I just saw you with Juliet.
I figured if you're the guy she left me for, then your name must be...
Ben? No. - I'm sorry. My mistake.
miss, I have a note for you.
meet me upstairs ui 5 -C
paper plates are bad for the environment.
Oh, come on, Rufus. It's not gonna kill anyone if we use paper plates just for one day.
uh, excuse me. I'm going to the restroom.
I mean, we all have to do our part. - When was the last time you used a paper plate?
Nate! Come on. I need a drink.
Yeah, the bar is right here. We can just... - Yeah, well, screw the bar.
we keep the good stuff in the kitchen. Come with me.
I don't believe it. You've been seeing Ben?!
Shh! We can't talk about this here, okay?
please? No one can see us together.
okay? - Fine
but you bet your ass we're talking about this.
so that is the guy that Juliet broke up with me for.
he just lied to my face. - Juliet's dating him, too?
too? - So is Serena.
I knew that Juliet was evil. I have to go warn Serena.
if you left me for that guy, you can say so.
you know, why is it such a big secret? - It's not what you think.
now if you don't mind... - No, first... you're gonna tell me what's going on.
you've lied to me enough.
he's my cousin, Nate.
and the reason we don't want people to know is because he's a teacher, and I'm a student...
and he's dating Serena. - Oh, my God.
she borrow my tiara. She not give it back yet.
but that's okay. She is 20.
she deserve 20 tiaras.
she has great heart, style, and grace...
even when she get mad.
happy Birthday, miss Blair!
Hi, everyone. I'm Rita, and I'd also like to salute the birthday girl, and I brought some special friends to help me with the toast.
or... should I say "roast"?
who is that woman? - Robyn. She's an incredible musician.
Hey, I tried Rita's cell and got no answer. - I-I-I think she's busy.
luckily, Robyn was working with me in New York this week and able to bring along a very special video of Blair.
what is it? - A Jack Bass sex tape?
a Nelly Yuki snuff film?
let me take you back to a summer night in Stockholm, to an afterparty for one of Robyn's shows.
no. Hey!
Blair... - just kidding!
No! No!
Hey, Robyn. Jealous?
is she all right? - I'm fine.
I'm coming on tour!
I... Die.
how could you bring that video here?
I'm sorry. I got a call. He said it was a roast.
of course he did. - "He" who?
Charles Bartholomew Bass. Who else?
I told you not to invite him.
you were flirting with that model.
you were flirting with that lacrosse player.
he's my friend, and I was just using him to stay away from you.
you were trying to make me jealous?
no, I wasn't. But were you jealous?
we're in your bedroom.
I don't think I can make it six weeks.
well, maybe staying away from each other is so hard - because that's not what we should be doing. - Maybe...
I am in complete agreement.
I really want this, but not here.
you know how ashamed I am of that video. "Stand by your man"?
gossip Girl is offering a cash reward.
it only takes one video to topple an entire career.
if you don't believe me, just YouTube "Connie Chung piano.
Blair, just listen to me. - Why did you do it, huh?
because I knew that Jack was in Chile last summer?
I only found out because I was desperate for news of you.
you were? - All summer, when I was pretending not to care,
I wanted to know where you were.
I paid a private eye to look, but the only Bass he got was your scaly uncle.
Blair, as much as I hate being at peace with you, I didn't do this.
if you can stand there and lie to my face, then you're either pure evil or just a common sociopath.
you really believe that? - Of course I do!
and even if Nate and Serena peeked at the treaty, - you're the only one with a motive. - Actually, there was someone else.
is this a joke? - You did this?
my sister doesn't feel safe to live in her own house or be with her parents on their anniversary.
she was a different person before she met the two of you.
come on, Dan. It's not about Jenny.
it may have started out that way, but this is about you and getting revenge, and you went behind my back to get it.
I know, Nate, but come on. They deserve what they get.
I'm not sorry. - No, I'm the one who's sorry.
I'm sorry you've become one of them.
Blair, we had a treaty.
okay, we have a big problem.
Serena's professor is Colin... our cousin Colin.
and what's the problem? - He has no idea what we're doing!
if he finds out, I-I will lose everything!
don't tell me about losing everything. - I'm sorry.
I know that there's no love lost between you two, but I need him.
pays for my school, my rent. - What you need is to get Serena caught with her professor, whoever he is.
did you get the proof like we talked about?
not yet, but, Ben, he obviously has no idea who she is, that's she's the one responsible for all...
it's because she's responsible that you have to do this.
it is the only way to make things right.
it is the only way for our family to ever move on.
now please, Jules, get the proof and get Serena expelled.
Robyn gave this to me, and she swore it was her only copy.
you are safe. - Well, that's good news, I guess.
but I'm still mortified.
Dean Reuther saw it. Madeleine Albright. I-I'm a failure at 20.
are you kidding? Elsa Maxwell says that a good party gives people what they don't expect.
well... I suppose watching Rachel Zoe get dipped in chocolate like a strawberry wasn't boring.
nothing around you ever is.
something else is wrong?
what I want is to be a powerful woman.
but whenever Chuck's around, I just feel like a weak little girl.
I shut myself off for a long time after your father left.
I was cold and hard. Then I met Cyrus, and he taught me that sometimes you have to allow yourself to be weak in order to grow stronger.
well, that sounds good, but it feels terrible.
you don't have to lose the girl to be a woman.
just... need to think maybe about how many people are going to be around the next time you let her out.
I am going to bed.
good night.
it was just a silly karaoke video. At least no one got hurt.
Yeah, I just... I've never seen Dan like that.
I pray it's an isolated event. I'd hate to think I lost both my kids to the Upper East Side.
well, I'd hate for you to think that, too.
what? - That's a lot of paper.
Eric! Did you do this? - Well, I helped, but it was all Dan.
well, maybe there's a little Humphrey left in that kid after all.
you know, there are ten minutes left of our anniversary.
you know, just enough time to save it.
Hey.
so I wrecked Blair's birthday and I betrayed Nate,
I've disappointed my dad, and as the icing on the cake,
I pretty much ruined his and Lily's anniversary.
other than that... How was your night?
it was Blair's 20th birthday party, and I'm still acting like an eighth grader!
Oh, my God. Is it possible the Upper East Side is contagious?
I think we've proven that it is.
we just need some rest and a good dose of Brooklyn.
Yeah. Thanks for being here.
we've been friends forever, and that's not gonna change.
dad, I am so sorry.
wait a second. You liked it?
at the end of every war, the warriors come home, hoping what they've seen and done won't stay with them forever.
Anthony patch is more tragic than Gatsby.
I can't believe you actually read it.
well, why wouldn't I? You gave it to me.
you know, I think I like you too much to do this right now.
we've come this far, and the old me would've gone farther, but the new me really wants to wait.
I'm glad I know the new you.
she's a great teacher.
Ugh. So, six more weeks... - Yeah.
at least we stopped ourselves before we made a mess of everything.
no one found out, so we're safe.
well, in that case...
buddha once said, "it's better to conquer yourself than to win a thousand battles.
but other soldiers can't give up the fight and go underground to plan the next war.
see ya.
but it's the true warrior who knows that wars don't end.
they simply change.
and there can never be peace as long as guns are still loaded and there's plenty of ammunition.
what are you still doing here, Chuck? I threw you out hours ago.
I wanted to let you know the treaty is over.
fine with me. This pretense of civility was exhausting.
being amicable isn't in our blood.
I've realized we're not friends. Friends have to like each other.
and after what happened tonight, I could never like you. - I could never like you either.
in fact, I hate you.
I've never hated anyone... more.
every nerve ending in my body is electrified by hatred.
there is a fiery pit of hate burning inside me, ready to explode.
so it's... settled then? - We're settled.
these weapons may be deadly.
gossip Girl here, your one and only soucre Into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
I have to be Blair Waldorf before I can be chuck bass' girlfriend.
if two people are meant to be together,
eventually they'll find their way back.
I gave up on your mother visiting a long time ago.
just wish she could see how great you're doing now.
you tried to destroy my friendship with Blair, my reputation, my academic career.
so who much will it take for you to leave my daughter alone?
I could really use some help from the inside right now.
what exactly did you have in mind?
we need to turn everyone against Serena.
how could I have kissed either of you when I couldn't even get into the party?
so someone dressed exactly like you just happened to be attracted to both of us?
I-I don't know. I can't explain it.
mom's not the only one who still sees me as a messed-up 16-year-old.
your sister just withdrew from Columbia.
alienate everybody, drop out of school, run away - That sounds like Serena.
I'm not sure there's anything we can do anymore.
thanksgiving-- my favorite holiday.
as always, I'll be spending it giving thanks for the bounty of secrets I've harvested from you this year.
but leave a place for me at your table.
I'll be back for just desserts.
strolling the christmas markets with daddy and Roman,
celebrating Beaujolais nouveau at le Tambour.
did you remember my new Burberry? - Yes.
that's the double-faced.
I need the shearling. Do you want me to freeze?
Yes. I want you to freeze.
why aren't you excited for me?
you know how much I love Paris in autumn.
with everything that's happened with Mr. Chuck and Miss Serena,
I also know that you want to get out of the dodge.
out of... Dodge. It's a place, not a pickup truck,
and I'm not leaving because of them.
well, not entirely because of them.
it's Anna's first holiday season.
so many traditions to share-- The breaking of oplatek,
the waiting for first star, The singing koledy.
do any of these traditions include getting to the point?
I took liberty of making Harold's famous thanksgiving pie for you.
I'm not sure that's getting through airport security.
I thought we could drop it off at Van der Woodsens' on your way to airport.
Serena is the one who forced Chuck and me into the open
and tried going after my committee.
she's the one staying at Lily's to avoid me.
shouldn't she be bringing me pies?
forget I mention it. I'll throw pie in trash.
no.
it's fine. But this is only about pies and traditions.
that's all.
do they have a word in Polish for "pain in the ass"?
we have relatives I don't know about?
it's always a possibility.
your mother wanted to pull out all the stops this year.
so this is about, uh, denial.
have you heard from Serena? - No.
she hasn't responded to any of my texts.
and, granted, most of them included angry emoticons,
but, uh, I was actually thinking of going over to Blair's now to try to talk to her.
you will do no such thing. - Come on, Lil. It's the holidays.
she dropped out of college. She refuses to return our phone calls.
she's a grown woman throwing temper tantrums just to punish me.
when she is ready to take responsibility for her actions, we'll talk.
until then, you know what? I'm done being punished.
you know, and everything looks so great.
maybe just move the, uh, flowers a little closer.
how could they not have pumpkin pie?
we're at foragers market. I'm sure we'll find something.
how about the organic pumpkin tarts with gluten-free crust?
do I look like I could have baked those?
I told my dad I would. You know how he loves his tradition.
maybe you can tell him the new tradition is being truthful about the origin of thanksgiving dessert.
how about you come and tell him yourself?
he told me he invited you but you weren't sure if you were coming?
well, I wasn't sure if you wanted me to.
Yeah, I-I do.
I mean, if it weren't for you, I would have let Serena destroy my friendship with Nate.
friendships are important.
I saw the blast about what she did at saints and sinners.
have you spoken to her since that happened? - Nope.
not planning to. Neither is Nate.
kissing both of us proves that she doesn't care about either of us, so we're just trying to... Move on, now really think about it.
how's that working out for ya? - Pretty poorly, thank you, which is why I could
I could really use you there today if she does come,
so... What do you say?
do I have time to run back to the loft? I have this amazing tofu sage stuffing recipe.
for tofu? How could I say no?
I was gonna swing by before we left for grandfather's, If that's still okay with you.
of course. Can't wait.
just you?
she just needs more time, dad.
well... Time I got lots of.
tell your mom I said happy thanksgiving. - She'll come around, I promise.
it's just, uh, it'd be great to see her, you know?
I'd love the chance to talk to her so she could see for herself just how much I've changed.
let me talk to her. I'll see you soon, okay?
Yeah.
Mr. Stahl, what are you doing here? - Nathaniel.
just, uh, dropping off some papers for your mother.
well, on thanksgiving? - Yes.
well, they're time-sensitive.
you know what? She's... She's not in right now. She's getting her hair done, so... I can give that to her.
well... Okay.
Thanks. - Happy thanksgiving.
have a good one. - You, too.
petitioner, ANNE ARCHIBALD vs HOWARD ARCHIBALD
WERIFIED PERIRON FOR DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE AND REOUEST FOR PROVISONAL ORDERS
what are you doing here?
thanksgiving-- the only day of the year. It's acceptable to eat dinner before 8: 00.
of course. Right. Thanksgiving.
we bring pie.
I should have asked Lily if you were coming. I can leave if you'd like.
don't be silly. I was just headed to J.F.K.
but even if I wasn't, We should get used to little run-ins like these.
I mean, if Bruce and Demi cod do it, It can't be that difficult.
Blair, Dorota. What are you doing here?
just bringing a little tradition.
I'm spending the holidays with daddy and Roman in Paris.
I figured since we usually spend this day together,
that, you know... Um, is Serena here?
we thought she was with you.
no, I haven't seen her since Chuck's party.
she never came home. - Okay. All right. Now I'm worried.
Charles? - He's not at the empire.
well, then where the hell is she?
ZALEPLON 9-1-1. What is your emergency?
my name is Serena van der Woodsen.
I don't know where I am or how I got here.
please help.
Hey, man, I just got your text. What's up?
my mom's filing for divorce.
at least she's trying to.
I'm--I'm sorry, man. That sucks.
what am I supposed to do?
you know, how do I-- how do I stop this? - You can't.
I know it's not what you want to hear, but if kids Could fix their parents' relationships, they would.
hell, if we could fix our own relationships, we would.
that's your advice? Do nothing?
no. I mean, if it helps,
I know my parents are happier now than they were.
and don't take this the wrong way, But I mean, it can't come as a total shock, right?
it is. I mean, she's had years to do this.
the guy embezzled. He got arrested.
he tried to skip bail, and then he went to prison.
she stayed married to him this whole time, And now she wants out?
I mean, what's worse is that I feel he's--he's really changed.
I just-- I gotta get her to see that.
well, good luck. - Thanks, man.
actually, no. No, thanks. Your advice sucked.
I'm sorry. Hold on a second.
Hey. Uh, hey, dad. I'm at Nate's right now, But Vanessa should be there soon, though I should warn you, There is, uh, stuffing with tofu involved.
I hate to do this to you over the phone, but, um,
I need to tell you something, and I prefer to keep it in the immediate family for now.
Serena's in the hospital. - Is everything okay?
we hope so. We're at St. Margaret's.
all right, well, I'm close. I'll be there soon.
no. I understand, but when will we be allowed to see her?
no one's telling us anything.
well, just be patient, And someone will be with you soon. Okay?
let us know when you can! - Blair...
all they could tell us is what we already know.
she dialed 9-1-1 from a motel in queens
and that drugs were involved.
what are we supposed to do?
for now... just be here when she wakes up.
I'm gonna go get a cup of coffee.
Hi, dad. What's, uh, going on?
Hey, sweetie, I wish I didn't have to tell you this, but...
Serena's in the hospital. Looks like an overdose.
Oh, my god. What-- - We're hoping she's gonna be fine.
if it's okay with your mom, I'd really like you here with us.
I know you and Serena have a complicated past, But at the end of the day -
no, no, uh, of course. I'll get there soon as I can.
dad, can... Just tell lily how sorry I am.
I'm sure she'll appreciate that.
Hello?
what are you doing here? - holding down fort.
Why? Where is everyone?
maybe you should call Mr. Humphrey.
Jenny: Serena in trouble. We screwed up. Coming home.
Hey, this is Dan. Leave a message.
let me make a call, see if one of my doctors can get us some answers. - Thanks.
where is she? Is she all right? What happened?
she overdosed in some cheap motel in queens, alone.
why didn't she come to me?
I mean, no matter how angry we were at each other, she knows.
I don't know what I would do if anything happened to her.
what do the doctors say? - Rufus and Lily are waiting to talk to them.
what?
drugs in a cheap motel-- That does not sound like Serena to me.
sometimes I forget How much of a recent addition you are, Humphrey.
you met her as a girl coming home, trying to start over.
I wish it wasn't true, but...
sounds a lot like the Serena I used to know.
Mrs. Humphrey? I'm Dr. Keller.
it was a drug overdose, but it wasn't severe.
we have her on fluids right now, But her liver and kidneys look fine.
uh, what now? - Well, she's stable, so soon as she wakes up, We'll have to discharge her.
I was wondering if you wanted to discuss a place for her recovery.
I understand your family had a good experience with the Ostroff center.
well, she's not a drug addict, and she didn't mean to harm herself.
this was all sort of a stupid mistake. And as you said yourself, it wasn't severe.
the amount ingested isn't what worries me.
in addition to the painkillers and sleeping pills,
we found Nortriptyline in her motel room.
it's an antidepressant, but taken in conjunction with the other medications, it can be fatal.
was your daughter battling depression? - No.
uh, not that we're aware of.
I'll give you a minute. - Thank you.
do you think she was taking something and not telling us? - I don't know.
this was Serena acting out, blowing off steam Like she always does.
it just went too far.
that's all.
looking for this?
any other earth-shattering news you plan on having delivered today?
you opened it?
you're honestly gonna make this about me not respecting your privacy?
mom, you're not even giving him a chance.
I mean, after everything that he's been through- - Everything he's been through.
what about what I've been through?
I'm sorry, but your father walked away from us
long before he went to prison.
but he's there now, and he's changed.
the only thing that's changed is he's two years into his sentence, and he's starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
that's not true, and if you talked to him, You wouldn't feel that way. Mom, please.
just come see him with me.
I mean, don't you owe him at least that?
we need to be at your grandfather's by 6: 00. You can see your father tomorrow.
we saw you talking to the doctors. How is she? - When can we see her?
doctor thinks it might be a good idea for Serena to get some help.
what kind of help? - Oh, my god. They don't think she did this on purpose, do they?
no. No one's saying that. - But there's a chance?
have you made a decision? - No.
we need to think. - Here's a crazy suggestion.
why don't we ask Serena and see what she wants?
well, she's not gonna go anywhere but home. I can tell you that right now.
if you decide she needs treatment,
we have grounds to sign off on an involuntary admission.
you can't be serious. To admit her against her will is wrong.
and if you do that, you're not gonna be able to take it back.
but what if we don't, and it happens again?
I-I'm sorry, but I'm scared for her.
it would be different if she never acted out like this, but she has.
it's your choice, Lil. We'll support you, - Whatever it is you decide. - Guys?
I just want what's best for her.
what if it's the only way for her to move on, get centered? - Guys!
...Well-known Manhattan socialite and former party girl Serena van der Woodsen,
was admitted to St. Margaret's emergency room after E.M.T.S responded to a 9-1-1 call from a motel in queens.
I don't know where I am or how I got here. Please help.
Oh, my god.
no stranger to controversy, Ms. Van der Woodsen was recently the focus of...
there are news vans in the streets.
this place is gonna be swarming with paparazzi in about five minutes.
so we'll get her out of here, take her home where she can rest.
no. I'm sure that they're pitching tents Outside the apartment as we speak.
that's not what she needs. She needs quiet. She needs safe.
Mrs. Humphrey, your daughter is waking up now. Would you like to see her?
Ostroff center. - And if she doesn't wanna go?
involuntary hold?
Yes. Now. - Okay.
spacious.
your room is bigger than mine was.
how you feeling? - Betrayed, thanks.
Serena, I know right now- - Mom, stop.
your daughter wakes up alone, drugged in an empty motel room, and you don't call the cops. You don't ask if she's okay or what happened.
you just have her committed.
what kind of mother does that?
the kind of mother who wants her daughter safe.
is that what you're telling yourself? That this is what's best for me?
well, Serena, this isn't exactly what's best for me.
you know, it would be a lot easier to take you home and act like this never happened.
but I'm afraid for you.
how could you let her do this to me?
because I love you.
when I was in here, I didn't wanna be, at least not at first.
I'm not in denial, Eric. I didn't do this.
it took me a long time to come to terms with what I did, too.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you when we first found out. I...
no, don't worry about it, man. So what happened?
she told the doctor she can't remember anything.
at the party, Serena said she didn't kiss either of us,
that she had no idea what happened.
and now this. Now what--what if something else is going on?
or maybe you just wanna think that because it's easier than the truth.
mom: Where are you? The car is waiting.
look, I gotta go. Uh...
just tell Serena "hey" for me when you see her, okay?
Yeah, sure, of course.
Dan, I care a lot about Serena. I always will.
whether she realizes it or not, this is how she pulls people back in.
and I'm not gonna let it happen anymore.
neither should you.
we need to talk.
to my super about letting strangers into my apartment?
no, about Serena. - Her overdose?
I had no idea she was so depressed.
she wasn't, until we made her that way.
I mean, we turned everyone against her--Dan, Nate, Blair.
anything Serena did after she left that party is not our fault.
maybe, but we still need to tell her what we did
and tell her that we're sorry.
I mean, her mom had her admitted to the Ostroff center.
Serena needs to know she's not crazy. I'm going there now.
okay, wait.
no matter what we did, Serena still went on a bender and overdosed.
maybe she needs the help that center can provide.
who knows? We may have called attention to a larger problem
that could have been much worse.
but promise me that You're not gonna say anything without talking to me first.
okay. I gotta go.
I see my mom is sending in the big guns.
no, Lily didn't send me. In fact, I don't
I don't think she's a fan of mine right now.
what happened?
honestly, I don't know. But I really wish I did because then maybe I could explain it to everyone.
what's the last thing you remember? Like, what do you know for certain?
heading into the party to look for you.
you were the one that I came to kiss.
you and only you.
it's the last thing I'm certain of. It's...
the only thing I still am.
get your stuff.
I was just about to call you. Have you heard from Jenny?
she just left. Where are you?
I'm heading to the Ostroff center after talking to Dan.
Oh, good, because Jenny's on her way over there now to come clean about what we did.
well, maybe she should.
I will tell you the same thing that I told her with one caveat.
we are not responsible for what Serena did after she left that night.
if Jenny wants to come clean, They will forgive her eventually.
she's family. You're not.
you will lose all of them, especially Dan.
he will use you as an excuse to go right back to Serena,
and this time, that's where he'll stay.
if Jenny wants to go down for something that we didn't do,
then that's her call. But she goes down alone.
there you are.
I thought I'd go pick her up some comfort food from E.A.T.
do you wanna come up?
sure, I guess.
I'm glad that we can be here together for Serena.
I'd like to know that when push comes to shove,
maybe nothing has to change between us.
dad, I came as soon as I - Sorry.
I had to tell him what you did to Serena. - What I did?
Vanessa told me she overheard how you were gonna turn everyone against Serena.
that's the real reason you came back - To teach her some kind of a lesson? Well, you sure did.
are you proud of yourself? Rufus, I can't believe what just happened.
what's wrong? - It's Serena. She's gone.
time to head in?
Yeah, but you have another visitor joining you first. I'll be right back to get you.
mom. - When you didn't show up at the car,
I thought long and hard about what you said.
I'm not making any promises, but at the very least,
I should hear your father out before I end things.
what changed your mind?
we made a ton of mistakes in our marriage,
but you weren't one of them.
if my son is asking me to do this, then I need to try.
and, uh, grandfather's thanksgiving?
it'll be nice to make him wait. No one ever does.
how do I look? - You look great.
all right, why don't you grab some food, whatever you can for the trip?
I'm gonna get some, uh, clothes and toiletries.
okay. We got some, um, apples, but they're squishy and brown.
uh, cereal...
not much else except some old milk and tofu, if you like that, which you apparently do.
mm, no, that's Vanessa. - Where is she?
that's a good question. You know, there's a bodega by the bus station.
come on. I bust you out of the loony bin.
you're gonna mock my choice of transportation? We're fugitives, all right?
we're taking the bus.
are we really doing this-- just running away together?
no, running away is what guilty people do.
we're just getting out of the city for a few days
to get some space and clear your head. It's a... It's a vacation.
a vacation? I like that.
Hey. Thank you for believing in me.
how can I not?
there you are. - Both of you.
I didn't wanna get into it in front of everyone,
but now it's your turn to face the music.
maybe I did try to trick Serena at the saints and sinners party, but I didn't do it alone. And we didn't mean for it to end up like this.
we? - Yes, me, Juliet, and vanessa-- we were all in it together.
that's not what Vanessa said.
what, are you gonna believe her more than me?
Jenny, I'm not gonna argue with you about how responsible you are.
one-third, two-thirds. You can't deny you did it, and I am not Vanessa and Juliet's father. I'm yours.
Serena could have died. - I know!
dad, I know. I'm sorry! I...
it was supposed to be a prank to teach her a lesson.
I never should have come back to the city.
well, on that we can both agree.
then I guess there's no reason for me to stay.
Jenny, where are you going?
you can spare me whatever you rehearsed on the way over. I'm not going back.
even if it's what's best for you? - You don't get a vote.
I can't believe you took her side. - Serena
look, call whoever you need to call, but the only way I'm going back there is in a straitjacket.
Dan, you stay here for just a moment.
you may not agree with every decision I make regarding my daughter's well-being, but you have no right to intervene.
I am her mother. I know her much better than you do,
and I have been there for certain parts of her life
that you have no idea about.
Really? Which parts are those?
because from the way Serena tells it,
it sounds like I've clocked more hours by her side than you have.
look, I love you.
you know that.
and you have a big heart just like your father,
and just like him, you tend to see the good in everyone. No matter what they do.
no, not always.
she's not just the beautiful teenage girl you saw at some party anymore.
she's a troubled young woman,
avoiding some very real consequences.
and unless you wanna help her deal with those,
then I suggest you step out of the way so that I can.
with all due respect, Maybe I am only seeing the good in Serena,
but--but I'm at least looking at her and not at myself.
and what is that supposed to mean?
you committed her because you don't wanna deal with her.
you--you don't even wanna talk to her.
Why?
well, maybe I'm afraid of what she might say.
maybe...
what she did was a cry for help...
and I'm the only one who can hear it.
well, I... I don't know, but if that is the case, You should know, and if it's not,
then we really should find out what happened,
but regardless, the only way to find out is to- -is to sit and talk.
what makes you think I wanna talk to you any more than her?
do you remember when I had my problem?
and I never wanted to go to Dr. Sherman?
so you would walk me and wait outside the building to make sure that I went in,
and an hour later you'd be standing there to walk me home,
no questions asked.
if it wasn't for you, I'd never have gotten better.
except I don't need to get better. I didn't do anything.
so, what? Someone went on a bender and rented a room with your credit card - and forced pills down your throat? - I know how it sounds.
good, cause it sounds... - Crazy. Yeah. I got that.
afternoon, upper east siders.
were your dinners as filling as mine was?
hope not, because have I got some dessert for you...
with sugar on top.
mom, um... I'm sorry.
it seems everyone's favorite party girl
fell off the wagon and landed in rehab.
good luck getting a lohan-dle on things, s.
from the looks of it, You've got a lot to recover from.
take me back to Ostroff.
Hey.
if I don't remember what happened in this photo,
who knows what else I did that I don't remember?
don't do that to yourself.
thank you for being the one person who believed in me...
even though it turns out you were wrong, too.
I wasn't wrong to believe in you.
I still do.
I always will.
mom's downstairs. You ready?
I really thought I was doing the right thing. I'm--I'm sorry.
why don't you come back to the apartment with us?
I'm hoping it's where your sister ran off to,
and maybe we can turn this thanksgiving around.
Thanks, but I-I-I really need to spend some time alone.
we're around if you change your mind.
where have you been? I've been trying to contact you.
I was baking you a pumpkin pie with a file inside.
what's up with you? We have a lot to be thankful for.
saints and sinners went perfectly. Everyone turned against her.
I even got her to drop out of Columbia.
that's great. W-why didn't you tell me?
because it's Serena.
she worms herself out of everything,
and I needed to make sure that there was one more nail In her coffin.
something that would force Her family and friends to look at her differently... Forever.
what did you do?
they took Serena to St. Margaret's on a drug overdose.
Oh, my god. You drugged her?
don't worry.
I don't think there was any permanent damage - To her health, at least.
that was not part of the plan.
well, I made it part of the plan.
my financial support, Apartment, Columbia, Nate...
look, this isn't just about you anymore.
if there is a line that you wouldn't have crossed,
you should've told me before I lost everything.
happy thanksgiving, brother.
you know, I'd never even been to Brooklyn Until Serena met Dan Humphrey.
now I know the drive way too well.
I missed my flight and I forgot to call daddy and Roman. They'll be worried.
I should do that when I get home. It'll be way too late there now.
we should go back to my place, see what food I have. Maybe watch a movie?
Dorota downloaded a whole bunch of mgm musicals for the plane.
she said it would cheer me up. I know how much you love Cyd Charisse.
Blair. - I'm sorry.
I'm just a little bit of a mess right now.
after everything that happened today,
the thought of losing Serena forever...
maybe a part of me is questioning what I said to you last week.
I showed up today for Serena.
what you said was right.
we need to be on our own, figure out where we go from there.
otherwise, we're just torturing ourselves.
this isn't torturing me.
I can't be your friend right now,
as much as I wish I could.
I'm sorry. - I'm not.
I got to spend a little more time with you.
happy thanksgiving, Chuck.
sorry. - Oh, no, it was me.
Hey, Juliet. See you next week?
I'm actually going away for a bit.
he's really spent this time getting his life in order, hasn't he?
and here I thought all the times he wanted me to come out here. He was up to no good.
I love saying "I told you so."
well, you have a right to.
I'm proud of you.
you've always held this family together. - All right.
well, I'm glad you let me.
I'll see you at grandfather's. I'm gonna say bye to dad.
maybe tell him the good news?
I'll call you a car. Okay.
do you know that once upon a time, Thanksgiving was my favorite holiday?
I guess we should know better at this point.
at least Serena's safe for now.
did you find Jenny?
she texted she was on her way back to her mother's. - oh, good.
listen, Lil, I don't totally understand this,
but I-I think Jenny had something to do with what happened to Serena.
well, whatever happened, um, Serena did what she did.
and if anyone should accept responsibility, it's me.
it was my job to raise my daughter.
to make the right choices when life didn't go as planned,
and I failed.
parenting can only go so far.
and you and I couldn't be any more different In that regard,
yet we both have daughters we can't control.
Hey, what do you say to packing up some of this dinner we never had and, um, spending the rest of the holiday at Ostroff with the family?
Oh, my gosh.
you know what? I have one stop to make, and then I'll meet you there, okay?
Absolutely.
how many times do I have to go courtney love on your ass
before you get the message? I don't want you here!
the girl in gossip girl's blast isn't Serena.
what? - It's Juliet.
we had a plan to turn everyone against her.
when you and Chuck were exposed at his party, that was me. - You?
and while I was doing that, juliet was kissing Dan and Nate.
we were both dressed exactly like Serena.
this is from her costume,
and it's what she wore in those photos.
that's a pretty tall tale from a not too reliable source.
Blair, what reason do I have to come clean?
like it or not, you know me,
and you know that I love a good game as much as the next girl,
but I would never want to hurt Serena for real.
Juliet did, and she used Vanessa and me to do it.
are you willing to go double agent,
help me bring Juliet down
I wish I could, but you were right in banishing me.
I thought I could change, and I didn't.
so I think the best thing for me to do is go...
and stay gone.
Thanksgiving without Jenny Humphrey...
what fun would that be?
Juliet's apartment's empty.
I'm pretty sure she left town.
good luck.
during the holidays, we call customary patterns of behavior tradition.
and like any pattern, once established,
they are not easily broken.
right on time.
I like that.
you couldn't have waited till tomorrow? No, I couldn't.
I assume this will be enough to protect my daughter's history.
like we talked about last week,
as long as the check arrives every month,
the past stays in the past.
Oh, and... I heard about Serena.
I am so, so sorry.
at least she's getting the help that she needs.
I'm a firm believer in people facing what they've done.
happy thanksgiving.
other times, we convince ourselves we can start new traditions...
really nice seeing your mother up here after all this time. - Yeah.
just in time, too, right?
just in time for what? Your father's parole.
he was talking about how much it'll mean to the parole board
to hear who he's going home to.
and with your mom by his side, I'm sure he'll get out.
Yeah. Thanks. I'll see you later.
only to realize it wouldn't be a tradition if it changed.
I didn't order anything.
just because we can be friends doesn't mean we aren't always, B
Jenny: I told Blair everything. Good luck lying your way out of this one.
mom? Hey, it's me.
I think I'm gonna come home after all.
can you pick me up? I'm gonna take the last train.
Hey. Did you find what you needed?
other times, ever things we never realized were traditions can become one.
whatever happens from here on out, we'll handle it together, okay?
but the best kinds of traditions are the ones that bring people together,
even under the most unlikely of circumstances.
I owe you an apology.
Juliet may have been behind Serena's overdose,
and I have no intention of letting it go unavenged.
I need your help to find her and extract a confession.
are you in? - Aren't I about the last person you'd want helping you?
you love Serena, don't you?
so we have something in common.
what do you say we find that bitch and get his little friend here justice?
come together right now.
gossip girl here
your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
Blair waldorf working the door.
I got an internship at "w.
knowing you, you'll be editor by May.
he shouldn't have been having an affair with a student.
he never touched me, mom.
you sent an innocent man to prison.
Ben, you came. Can we talk?
I see that look in your eye, and I know exactly what it means, but I don't want to be with you.
I realize my wife hasn't treated you justly in any way, but I'd like to help. I have an extra room at my loft, and I'd love if you moved in.
my father's gonna do everything humanly possible to acquire Bass industries.
I don't want to stop seeing you.
I can handle the complications if you can.
it's been great catching up, mr. D. but my friend just arrived. I'd introduce you, but you may or may not have statutorily raped his sister.
might be a tad awkward.
consider this a warning.
stay away from serena. Stay away from her family.
you wanna hang out?
sorry, Damien. I'm done with the pills, all right?
a wise woman once said that every morning when you wake up, you say a little prayer.
after all, you never know what your day may hold.
sorry, I only have an hour before my next meeting.
then we've got no time to waste.
from a warm good-bye...
ten things I need done in an hour.
sorry. Fashion week is starting.
...to a chilly hello.
you have no new messages.
from quiet solitude to surprise company.
Hi. Can I help you?
Hi. I'm here for the home inspection.
inspection for what?
sorry we're late. You must be Ben's parole officer.
better switch that thing off or bring it to bed.
Vibration's a terrible thing to waste.
sorry. That's my dad.
what? I can't ignore his calls.
he's my boss, remember? - How could I forget?
don't move. - Don't worry.
Hi, dad. I'm just running late.
I'll be right there. I gotta go. Rain check.
no, no. - What's wrong?
just lost the ace for the kickoff party.
have to find a replacement large enough for Florence and the machine to perform, call the caterers, reroute the flowers and the gift bags.
that sounds like my kind of crisis.
what can I do to help?
stop distracting me with questions, for starters, and have you even finished your list? That's a "no.
so I guess in addition to everything else I have to do this week,
I will spend your entire performance review tomorrow discussing your inability to finish your tasks in a timely fashion.
no. I can't tank my review.
this internship is everything, and I've been working hard.
try to understand. Epperly's under a lot of pressure.
please, I've celebrated more fashion weeks than birthdays.
I know how it is. My mother's very high-strung.
in fact, in the years between her marriages, you wouldn't believe... Wait a minute.
how long do you think it's been since Epperly had her strings plucked?
excuse me? - Well, there's no shame in it.
it's just what happens when you're married to your job.
it's hard for a powerful woman to find the time.
but maybe all I have to do to get epperly off my back is to get her on hers.
last time I checked the intern packet,
I don't think "pimp daddy" was included in the description of duties.
well, it just so happens that epperly's perfect partner also owns the perfect hotel to host tonight's kickoff party.
two birds, one bass.
well, that's the grand tour
bedrooms in the back, kitchen's in the front.
90s rock relics everywhere.
well, everything looks good.
Ben, I'll see you at the end of the week, okay?
this is a pretty great thing you and your family are doing.
so... I really can't thank you enough, Rufus, for letting me crash in your old room.
and, Dan, I know this is a huge imposition, but I'm gonna do my best to stay out of your hair.
if at any time you want me gone, I am.
I'm sure it won't come to that.
the parole board would rather have you in a home setting.
so would we.
Hey, dad, can I talk to you for a second?
I'm gonna go unpack my stuff.
are you seriously letting Serena's stalker move in here?
I told you last week this was a possibility.
well, I didn't think you'd actually do it, especially without talking to me first.
I didn't think I needed your approval.
after everything he's been through, don't you think we owe it to him?
sure, if by "we," you mean Lily.
why doesn't he just move into Chuck's old room?
and what do you plan on telling Serena about this?
I'm sure she's not gonna be okay with it.
actually, she's more than okay with it.
it was her idea.
Hey. - Hey. I already got the tickets and the ginger-sesame-caramel popcorn, so
Yeah, I don't think I can make the movie today, man.
all right, well, let's...We'll just grab a coffee then.
no. I think I gotta get out of town for a few days, - maybe even longer. - Since when? Why?
since recently and for reasons i'm not at liberty to discuss.
Seriously? - Yeah.
come on. You know you can trust me with anything.
I mean, the amount of crazy crap that people tell me and expect me to keep to myself, all-all the drama about my mom and Serena and ben...
maybe that's the reason I can't tell you.
because it's about ben?
Damien, if you know something about him, you gotta tell me.
Rufus just moved him into the loft.
Ben's living with Dan now. Nice.
okay. The other morning, Ben jumped me.
what happened? - I don't know.
he-he just went nuts. Told me if I didn't get lost, he was gonna tell my dad I was dealing.
you don't know my dad, Eric. If he finds out, I am...
done. - Okay, that's crazy.
I mean, if anyone should have to leave the city, it's-its Ben, not you. That guy is dangerous, and I do not want him around my family or my friends.
look, don't go yet. I'm gonna figure something out.
did I hear Raina just leave?
what is that, three days in a row now?
things are getting serious. - Not fast enough.
we're stuck in this meaningless mind-blowing sex loop.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Raina's the one person that can stop her father from swallowing up Bass industries.
I need her to fall for me so she'll spare my company.
Yeah, well, she doesn't strike me as the love-at-first-sight type, so just give it some time.
time is the one thing I don't have.
one of my corporate weasels informed me that their board is voting tonight at 8: 00 to approve the bid.
once that happens, Bass industries is toast.
I need to up my game. No pun intended.
Hello? Anybody home?
Epperly, meet my good friend Chuck Bass.
nice to meet you, mr. Bass.
that's Nate. Chuck, we need a favor.
the magazine lost its space for the kickoff party tonight, and Epperly and I both agree the empire would be the perfect replacement.
sadly, the empire is spoken for, - but the palace is available. - The palace...
would lend an air of old-world sophistication to the evening.
I'd have to check with Florence's manager.
do you have a stage?
they'll have one by tonight.
okay. I can get behind that.
and that brings me to another point of business.
Nate, would you show epperly the view from the roof?
it's something you must see.
excellent idea. I need to speak to Blair alone for a moment.
looks like our favorite upper east sinners just found the answer to their prayers.
I need your help.
lucky for us, their road to heaven leads straight through hell.
Hey. Dorota told me you were here.
Yeah, I came by to check on eric.
with my mom away, I knew he wouldn't run into her, but turns out he's gone, too. Want a berry?
no, thanks. I already had breakfast with my new roommate Ben.
what were you thinking?
that he deserves a second chance.
Oh, to what, to drug you and leave you for dead in a motel room again?
that wasn't Ben. That was Juliet, and you know it.
and now she's off doing independent study somewhere, and I don't even think they talk anymore.
look, I understand that you feel badly about what happened and what Lily did, but you can't forget that this guy spent the past six months out to get you.
Ben was a good guy before all this happened, and if you kept an open mind, you'd see that he still is.
you'd see what I see.
what? - You have feelings for this guy.
no. Not that it's any of your business.
it doesn't matter how I feel or don't feel about Ben.
he's made it perfectly clear he wants nothing to do with me.
I haven't even heard from him since the "w" party.
Yeah. I guess i'm way off base.
Hey.
Serena, what's going on?
two guys from Newel just showed up here with a bookcase from ms. Van der Woodsen?
I can explain. I'll be right there.
Hey.
there you are. I have to go now. I'll call you later.
Where's she going? - To see Ben.
that's not a good idea.
tell me about it. What do you mean?
well, contrary to what Rufus and Serena believe, he hasn't changed.
he beat up a friend of mine just last week.
we have got to get rid of this guy, show everybody how dangerous he is.
what can I do for you?
Epperly, my boss.
fashion week just started, so she's a stress case, but my performance review is tomorrow, and I need it to go well.
surely saving tonight will earn you the gold star you crave.
no, it will calm her for a nanosecond until she finds something else to stress about.
I believe that only one thing can relax Epperly, and it's something that I can't give to her.
you need to turn that frown upside down before she pulls out the grading pencil.
and you're just the man for the job.
I'm not sure I am. I've spent the last few weeks trying every trick I know in the bedroom to get Raina to fall in love with me
business reasons, of course. Nothing seems to be working.
that's because that's how you win a guy's heart, not a girl's.
if you want Raina to fall for you, you have to stop pulling on her drawstrings and start pulling on her heartstrings.
and where are they located, exactly?
in a common connection.
you and I bonded over a mutual love of scheming...
and burlesque. Find something that you and Raina both share.
let your guard down.
show her a side of you that no one else sees.
I... Hear girls love that.
open up, and she'll be forced to follow suit.
and once you hook her, reel her in, gut her emotionally and throw the carcass overboard.
you really do have a gift.
so it's a deal.
if I'm focused on Raina,I can't expend energy on Epperly.
that is not fair. I give you gold and you can't spare two hours?
think of her as an amuse-bouche.
you were right, Blair. The view is great up there.
it's so pretty.
Nate... I was just saying how you should come with me and epperly to lunch.
Yeah, sure, I'll go to lunch, as long as Epperly doesn't mind.
no, I'd love that.
so I'm sure Ben was a perfectly nice guy when serena met him, but you lock anybody up for three years...
Yeah, for a crime he didn't commit.
I've seen every episode of "oz." That place can change a man.
all right, so where's this friend of yours?
Hey. - Damien is your friend?
just hear him out, all right?
Eric, the guy's a drug dealer.
who helped you and blair find juliet as soon as he realized Serna got hurt.
Humphrey, personal differences aside, Ben is dangerous.
we all know that. We need to work together to expose him before it's too late.
no. No. My answer's "no." I'm not gonna team up with the one guy I trust less than ben, and neither should you.
did you remember to add the prospectus?
if I say no, will you stop asking me?
we need a unanimous vote tonight, Raina. Anything less, and the Bass board will sense weakness and put up a fight.
you have a beautiful hotel here.
I was just taking a look around.
with Raina by your side, of course. Smile, shake hands, send a message to the Bass board that thorpe enterprises cares about the future of these properties.
set them at ease.
I never thought of that.
okay, do I need to be here for this?
you're right. Where are my manners?
if you'd like the real tour, you can start with lunch at our restaurant.
I, have to get back to the office, but I think it's nice - A Bass and a Thorpe to be seen working together, breaking bread.
besides, there's nothing my daughter doesn't tell me.
shall we?
Oh, I'm-i'm so sorry. I just-I thought
don't apologize. Just return it.
I already called the delivery guys. I can return this, too.
I can't believe you remembered.
I remember everything you've read to me.
in case you haven't noticed,
I don't really let go of things so easily.
I guess I could use something to keep me company at night, but the bookshelf still goes.
I was about to go out and get some lunch. You wanna join me?
I don't wanna raid the Humphreys' pantry, but I'm kinda starving.
well, I told the delivery guys i'd be here, so why don't we order in, if that's okay with you?
I know where the menu book is.
so, Epperly, have you always worked in fashion?
pretty much. After oxford, I worked at the met for Harold Koda at the costume institute.
but more importantly, you were a power Pilates instructor.
for one semester in... College.
but it still counts. Core strength lasts a lifetime.
this is Epperly.
what do you think? - She's cool.
what else?
she's smart, stressed about work.
where are you going with this?
you need to sleep with her right away.
what?
I need you to relieve all that pent-up tension before my first performance review tomorrow, and you better not be selfish, Archibald. You know what I mean.
this is why you've been dragging me around?
well... What's the big deal?
it's not like you haven't done it before.
just think of her as younger, more flexible lady Catherine.
trouble. Florence is stuck at j. f.k.
because the machine's flight is delayed.
well, Epperly, it's fine. We'll send another car.
why don't you two grab lunch, and I'll go get a jump on it at "w"?
no, I need to deal with this myself.
I'll see you back at the office.
I wasn't that selfish, was i? Was i?
you were right. Lunch was pretty amazing.
you'll have to tell justin when you see him.
he's our executive chef.
thank you, Daniel.
the service was impeccable as always.
thank you so much, mr. Bass.
that's the third waiter you've greeted.
Chuck, I know you're trying to make me feel guilty about buying the palace and firing all these nice people, but business is business. You know that.
what's with the show? - It's not a show.
I actually grew up here.
other kids have neighbors and potlucks.
I have concierges and room service.
I know these people because they're my extended family.
I guess I shouldn't expect you to understand.
actually, I do.
when my mother abandoned us, my dad couldn't sleep in our house anymore.
so he moved us into the penthouse of the Blake, and we never left.
nothing like being a guest in your own home.
let me take you out tonight.
there's a party here, then after maybe we can...
some other night?
I have a meeting I can't miss. In fact...
Oh, my god. I didn't realize the time.
I'm gonna get my coat.
I'll call you tomorrow.
okay, you have to try a shishito pepper. - Absolutely not.
my mouth is still on fire from the spicy tuna roll.
now please pour me some tea before I literally start to cry.
look, I'm sorry that I've been how I've been.
I just-I've spent the last three years blaming you for where I thought you put me.
and now here you are somewhere else that I put you.
is that a problem?
no, actually.
I'm beginning to think i'm supposed to be here.
how's everybody doing? - I should get going.
what are you doing? - Leaving.
what is it gonna take for you to see this is a dangerous situation?
what is it gonna take for you to see it isn't?
we're not dating, so if it's all the same,
I don't need your permission or protection.
look, dan, I know you're just looking out for serena, and I understand your concern. I do.
but you have nothing to worry about.
I swear.
watch out, lonely boy.
your new roommate's moving in fast, but you're the one who's going to have to unpack his lies.
Raina's remarkable.
I've honestly never been with a girl who understands me like she does.
no, today was just hard because I was showing her the palace.
I know pretty soon it's all gonna be gone.
it's the one place that still feels like home.
I thought Raina would understand that.
no, I am so sorry, Epperly.
I really thought that you and Nate would hit it off.
no, of course it's not you.
no, don't blame yourself.
he said he thought you were beautiful.
he's just coming off a really crazy relationship, you know?
no, I know. He's as smart as he handsome, isn't he?
don't push it. Wrap it up.
okay. Well, I'll see you back at work, Epperly.
Hey. I'll walk you to your car.
Thanks.
you know, I think I might like to see this place at night.
honestly, it's your loss, Archibald.
okay, so maybe I was too quick to say no about Epperly, but there's no harm in hanging out with her at the party now, - is there? - No harm at all.
Hey. - Hey, Serena.
look, I gotta run. I'll see you tonight, okay? Bye.
you're at home during the day with Nate? Do I smell a scheme?
no, I'm just grabbing a quick bite and a change of clothes for the party.
and you're not coming from school, are you?
no. I saw Ben.
he called me, and we had lunch, and... I don't know.
I think there really might be something there.
am I crazy? Please don't say "yes.
bad boys have never really been your thing, but damaged outsiders are a definite weakness.
what do you mean?
he's from a different social class. Your mother hates him.
he hates your mother. He's living in a loft in dumbo.
I knew Ben before I ever met Dan.
not my point.
just ask yourself this.
is it ben or the idea of him?
taking off. I'll see you later.
Hey, uh, glasses - Middle shelf.
salad plates - Bottom shelf. That's the way it's been my entire life, which is how long I've lived here... With my family.
listen, man, I know you're not too thrilled to have me staying here.
picking up on that, huh? Little bit.
look, when your dad offered me a place to stay, I had no idea that you were living here.
if you want me gone, don't rattle dishes. Just tell me.
I never meant for juliet to do what she did.
I've even told her to give me some space.
well, maybe you should tell her again. I saw she called you.
because it's my mom's birthday. That's the only reason.
like it or not, they're the only family I have. I'm not gonna lose them.
but it's okay for serena to lose hers?
she's already cutting herself off from her mother and eric over what happened.
if you really cared about her, you wouldn't make her choose between you or them.
yeah,'cause that's what you did when you guys were together.
are you saying you guys are together now?
that's her, isn't it?
Hey.
Hey. So I know it's last minute, but I was wondering if you wanted to come with me to the "w" party tonight.
party? Tonight?
you know, if you'd asked me an hour ago, I would've said that's not such a good idea, but, uh...
you know what? I'm in.
great. I can't wait to see you.
Eric: Where r u?
great news. Nate is coming to the kickoff party tonight... And he's very excited to see you.
that's great. Too bad I won't be there. - Why not?
moving the party has been a logistical nightmare, and my phone hasn't stopped ringing, and I can't miss a call.
Cinderella doesn't always get to go to the ball.
well, she can if she has all her calls forwarded to her blackberry and an able intern by her side the whole time.
I'm not saying to blow off your responsibilities, but if anything goes wrong, how can you fix it from here?
it's not a good idea.
you can still do your job and have a fabulous night at the same time.
Nate can't wait to see you.
trust me. It's like riding a very cute bike.
all right, but we have to leave now.
here's my phone. Do your forwarding magic. Different ringtones for different lines?
careful, Ben. Your boss's phone is ringing off the hook, and it's your job on the line.
there's nate. Let's go say hi.
maybe I should go make sure the gift bags are being set out properly.
I'm sure that they're fine. If anyone needs to reach you, you have your phone.
come on. Look alive.
ladies. Epperly, care to join me at the bar?
go get her.
so you go to things like this every week?
if you don't like it, we can leave. I just thought the music would be good?
Oh, no. I'm-i'm looking forward to it.
you thirsty? - Yes, please.
I missed my meeting. - Was I worth it?
I'll let you know.
I took the liberty of reserving my old suite.
perhaps after the show, we can continue your tour upstairs.
only on the condition that you show me something first.
your hiding place from when you were a little boy.
did nate tell you? - I grew up in a hotel, too, remember?
so can I see it?
it wouldn't be so secret if I just showed it to you.
fine. I guess I'll just have to find it myself.
watch where you're going, man. Watch where you're going!
Damien, what are you... Doing here?
this is a party. I go to these. You-not so much.
I told you to stay away from him. - Or what?
not here. - You name the place. I'll be there.
that's not what we planned. You said he had a short fuse.
Damien baited Ben. He just didn't bite.
Eric said you met his parole officer?
Yeah. Why?
you should call him. Parolee's about to get violent at a private event.
to be clear, I'm doing this for serena, and if you turn out to be lying about ben,
I will make sure that you never set foot in this town again.
understood. - I'll be back.
well...
what's this for? - Your hand in about three minutes.
you're gonna punch me in the face as hard as you can.
Blair, have you seen epperly?
Yes, and I can hear my performance review now.
check plus, check plus, check plus - You don't understand.
the party planner delivered all the gift bags to the old location.
well, I'm sure she can fix it. She's right over there.
I don't understand. Where'd she go?
warmer? - Scalding.
excellent.
under the table.
or...
in the corner... By the shelf.
the corner-how on earth did you know that?
I hid in the same place.
you can see everyone, but no one can see you.
I even carved my name in the wall with a salad fork.
the old wood floor was replaced by tile in the last reno.
otherwise, I could've shown you my work.
see? I know you better than you know yourself.
I know how much the palace means to you.
it's your home.
I think I can keep you from losing it.
Raina... Before we go any further, there's something I have to tell you.
don't bother. Allow me.
dad, wh-what are you doing here?
I should ask you the same question.
how dare you miss the meeting.
I told you, we needed a unanimous vote.
I'm sorry.
but I'm not even sure if we should buy bass industries anymore.
Raina... One of chuck's associates called our chairman tonight.
Chuck knew about the vote.
he kept you away on purpose.
is this true?
no, I wish you guys could have seen it.
Hey, Ben, I want you to meet Shala, Humberto, and Jen.
Hi. - How are you? Humberto.
uh, look, I think I'm gonna take off.
Oh, I'll come with you. - No, you should stay.
I mean, your family's here...
Eric, what are you doing here with... Damien?
what happened to your face? - Ben.
he threatened me earlier, and then he followed me to the bathroom, and then he jumped me.
Eric, are you kidding me? There's no way.
no, he did it. I saw it myself.
don't even try to deny it. I can see that look on your face.
sorry, s. , your new beau may have the right to remain silent but you just became the talk of the town.
I don't understand. It doesn't make any sense.
why would Ben just come and hit you unprovoked?
the guy's obviously got some serious anger issues.
and his parole officer just happened to be here? Come on.
no, I called him. Because you knew that he'd hit Damien?
because I knew he was a danger to you, to me, to anyone he came into contact with.
I tried to tell you all this, but you wouldn't listen to me.
because I don't believe it, and I don't believe you.
Serena, wait.
and in the dark wait.
did you really know our board meeting was tonight?
tell me the truth. - yes.
raina, when we first met,
I was so desperate to save my father's company. I didn't care what it took, who I had to betray.
I thought if you fell for me, you might find a way to spare it.
but after spending today together,I realized how much I actually do care about you.
I'm so sorry, Chuck.
there's nothing you can ever say to make me trust you again.
my father's waiting for me.
I won't be able to get you in front of a judge till morning.
let me guess. You're not springing for a room at this place.
this is serious, Ben. I'd hoped for better from you.
wait! Stop. You're making a mistake.
Serena, don't. - I know you didn't do anything. Tell him.
Nate, where's Epperly? We're having a gift bag crisis.
how should I know? She left with this guy she knew from oxford.
what? How could you let some toff just punt off with her?
he's definitely gonna try and hook up with her. You should've heard this guy's accent.
epperly was right.
you can't take your eye off the ball. I need to fix this.
let's go. You are gonna help me get 650 gift bags from 29th street in 20 minutes, or so help me, Archibald, I will tell everyone what your favorite movie is.
Hey, do not knock "the sound of music. " It's got nuns and Nazis.
Julie Andrews was hot.
so I say we go back to your place, pop in some "call of duty" and celebrate.
listen, man, I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but I think we're pretty much done here.
I don't understand. I...
I thought we were... Friends.
you're my client. Former client, actually.
so you were just using me to find out where ben was so you could get rid of me?
and now he's gone, and so am i.
see ya.
what happened?
are you seriously mad at me now?
well, I can't say i'm entirely pleased.
you put Max Cady in my living room. What was I supposed to do?
I guess I didn't realize how deeply you felt about it.
I know you got a lot on your plate right now. It's gotta be hard for you to be caught in the middle like this.
well, I'm sorry I didn't ask you first.
I thought I was doing the right thing.
uh, you were.
Ben didn't hit damien. I - I did.
Oh, my god.
Spotted-a lonely boy trying to save an innocent man.
looks like Brooklyn's the one who's guilty... By association.
Hey, have you talked to Eric? - He wasn't here when I got up.
I wouldn't be surprised if he was off somewhere with Damien.
I don't know what to do, how to get through to him.
it's gonna be okay. I'm meeting with nate. We're gonna take care of it.
uh, I've gotta call you back.
I don't know where to begin.
how about "i'm sorry"?
I didn't think that would be enough.
I'm pretty easy. - Well, then I'm sorry.
honestly, I don't know what I was thinking. I was jealous. I was angry.
I cost you a night in jail.
what's one more after three years?
thank you for calling my p. o.setting the record straight.
I'll pack up my stuff. - No, you don't have to move out.
in fact, I would like you to stay.
I realize you're someone I should trust, just like serena said I should.
she said that?
Yeah. If you don't believe me, you can ask her yourself.
Hey. Dan invited me to come over and wait for you.
she was right. I was wrong. Just give everyone else some time.
they'll come around.
I need to go meet Nate.
where have you been? - I was just getting coffee at sicaff? I- I got you one, too.
you should know that, um, Dan and Nate are on their way over to Damien's to look for you.
Yeah, well, Damien ditched me after the party, so...
strongest drug I'm on is double macchiato.
are we done? - No, no, no. We're not.
talk to me. Make me understand why you wanna spend so much time with a guy like him when you have all your other friends.
what other friends?
can't believe I'm gonna say this out loud. It sounds so stupid, but I...
I thought damien got me.
you know, we could just hang out together and do nothing.
he was there for me.
that kind of a guy always is.
Yeah. Yeah, well...
lesson learned. Thank you.
blair: You owe me!
for what?
a speechless Chuck Bass. Will wonders never cease?
honestly, I never thought you'd talk to me again. - Neither did i.
but then I got a phone call from your friend Blair.
not a staged call - A real one.
she told me you may have said all those things on the phone with her for the wrong reasons...
but that you also meant them.
when it comes to me, Blair has a nasty habit of never being wrong.
she said the same thing.
so I've decided to ignore my better judgment and give you a second chance.
if you ever lie to me again - You have my word.
business is business. You need to do what's right for thorpe enterprises.
I'll find another way to save my family legacy
one that doesn't involve you.
I would...
but I can't right now. I have a meeting.
dinner tonight?
room service.
from: CHUCK Thank you.
epperly's been in with Stefano for over an hour.
but... It was just gift bags.
and we still got them there on time.
this is all my fault.
I wanted epperly to get laid, not laid off.
did you get fired?
of course not. The party was a huge success.
are you having a psychotic break?
no, but I am taking a break. I quit.
Blair, at the party, I ran into the guy that I dated when I was living in london, and we spent the whole night together-just talking.
and he is heading off to Bali to a yoga retreat, and I...
decided I want to go with him.
you're leaving the magazine for "eat pray love"?
I guess you can't have it all. - No, of course you can.
don't quit. You're amazing at your job.
I know, and you will be, too. - What?
as a token of my appreciation for helping me see what was missing in my life,
I suggested that you be promoted to replace me. Congratulations.
Stefano's giving you a trial run, starting now.
this is the office, international, stefano only.
now your day begins every morning at 6: 00 a. m. With the milan conference call.
no, no, I am a full-time student. I go to columbia.
if james franco can do it, so can you.
Blair, you wanted it all, and you just got it.
they say the universe has a great sense of humor, that sometimes having your dreams come true can feel like a nightmare.
the board is waiting for us.
raina, after last night, I need to ask if I have your full support to buy bass industries.
Yes, under one condition.
name it. - After the deal closes,
I want you to give chuck a chance to be part of the new company.
I don't need Chuck's help to run Bass industries.
Yes, you do. You just don't know it yet.
because getting what you want always comes with strings attached.
CONCULATE GENERAL OF BELGIUM Archibald, Humphrey. What are you guys doing here?
well, we came looking for Eric. - We ran into your dad instead. He's a nice guy.
I mean, at least he was to us.
how he is to you after what we told him might be a different story.
wait. You guys realize what you've done?
my dad's gonna cut me off!
and even when you think you're finally in the clear, you're never home free.
you haven't slept.
I couldn't, not until I knew you were safe.
last night at the party when everyone else doubted you,
I never did, not for a second, and I never will.
what about your family?
what if us being together drives them all away?
gossip girl here
your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
Blair waldorf working the door.
I got an internship at "w.
knowing you, you'll be editor by May.
he shouldn't have been having an affair with a student.
he never touched me, mom.
you sent an innocent man to prison.
Ben, you came. Can we talk?
I see that look in your eye, and I know exactly what it means, but I don't want to be with you.
I realize my wife hasn't treated you justly in any way, but I'd like to help. I have an extra room at my loft, and I'd love if you moved in.
my father's gonna do everything humanly possible to acquire Bass industries.
I don't want to stop seeing you.
I can handle the complications if you can.
it's been great catching up, mr. D. but my friend just arrived. I'd introduce you, but you may or may not have statutorily raped his sister.
might be a tad awkward.
consider this a warning.
stay away from serena. Stay away from her family.
you wanna hang out?
sorry, Damien. I'm done with the pills, all right?
a wise woman once said that every morning when you wake up, you say a little prayer.
after all, you never know what your day may hold.
sorry, I only have an hour before my next meeting.
then we've got no time to waste.
from a warm good-bye...
ten things I need done in an hour.
sorry. Fashion week is starting.
...to a chilly hello.
you have no new messages.
from quiet solitude to surprise company.
Hi. Can I help you?
Hi. I'm here for the home inspection.
inspection for what?
sorry we're late. You must be Ben's parole officer.
better switch that thing off or bring it to bed.
Vibration's a terrible thing to waste.
sorry. That's my dad.
what? I can't ignore his calls.
he's my boss, remember? - How could I forget?
don't move. - Don't worry.
Hi, dad. I'm just running late.
I'll be right there. I gotta go. Rain check.
no, no. - What's wrong?
just lost the ace for the kickoff party.
have to find a replacement large enough for Florence and the machine to perform, call the caterers, reroute the flowers and the gift bags.
that sounds like my kind of crisis.
what can I do to help?
stop distracting me with questions, for starters, and have you even finished your list? That's a "no.
so I guess in addition to everything else I have to do this week,
I will spend your entire performance review tomorrow discussing your inability to finish your tasks in a timely fashion.
no. I can't tank my review.
this internship is everything, and I've been working hard.
try to understand. Epperly's under a lot of pressure.
please, I've celebrated more fashion weeks than birthdays.
I know how it is. My mother's very high-strung.
in fact, in the years between her marriages, you wouldn't believe... Wait a minute.
how long do you think it's been since Epperly had her strings plucked?
excuse me? - Well, there's no shame in it.
it's just what happens when you're married to your job.
it's hard for a powerful woman to find the time.
but maybe all I have to do to get epperly off my back is to get her on hers.
last time I checked the intern packet,
I don't think "pimp daddy" was included in the description of duties.
well, it just so happens that epperly's perfect partner also owns the perfect hotel to host tonight's kickoff party.
two birds, one bass.
well, that's the grand tour
bedrooms in the back, kitchen's in the front.
90s rock relics everywhere.
well, everything looks good.
Ben, I'll see you at the end of the week, okay?
this is a pretty great thing you and your family are doing.
so... I really can't thank you enough, Rufus, for letting me crash in your old room.
and, Dan, I know this is a huge imposition, but I'm gonna do my best to stay out of your hair.
if at any time you want me gone, I am.
I'm sure it won't come to that.
the parole board would rather have you in a home setting.
so would we.
Hey, dad, can I talk to you for a second?
I'm gonna go unpack my stuff.
are you seriously letting Serena's stalker move in here?
I told you last week this was a possibility.
well, I didn't think you'd actually do it, especially without talking to me first.
I didn't think I needed your approval.
after everything he's been through, don't you think we owe it to him?
sure, if by "we," you mean Lily.
why doesn't he just move into Chuck's old room?
and what do you plan on telling Serena about this?
I'm sure she's not gonna be okay with it.
actually, she's more than okay with it.
it was her idea.
Hey. - Hey. I already got the tickets and the ginger-sesame-caramel popcorn, so
Yeah, I don't think I can make the movie today, man.
all right, well, let's...We'll just grab a coffee then.
no. I think I gotta get out of town for a few days, - maybe even longer. - Since when? Why?
since recently and for reasons i'm not at liberty to discuss.
Seriously? - Yeah.
come on. You know you can trust me with anything.
I mean, the amount of crazy crap that people tell me and expect me to keep to myself, all-all the drama about my mom and Serena and ben...
maybe that's the reason I can't tell you.
because it's about ben?
Damien, if you know something about him, you gotta tell me.
Rufus just moved him into the loft.
Ben's living with Dan now. Nice.
okay. The other morning, Ben jumped me.
what happened? - I don't know.
he-he just went nuts. Told me if I didn't get lost, he was gonna tell my dad I was dealing.
you don't know my dad, Eric. If he finds out, I am...
done. - Okay, that's crazy.
I mean, if anyone should have to leave the city, it's-its Ben, not you. That guy is dangerous, and I do not want him around my family or my friends.
look, don't go yet. I'm gonna figure something out.
did I hear Raina just leave?
what is that, three days in a row now?
things are getting serious. - Not fast enough.
we're stuck in this meaningless mind-blowing sex loop.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Raina's the one person that can stop her father from swallowing up Bass industries.
I need her to fall for me so she'll spare my company.
Yeah, well, she doesn't strike me as the love-at-first-sight type, so just give it some time.
time is the one thing I don't have.
one of my corporate weasels informed me that their board is voting tonight at 8: 00 to approve the bid.
once that happens, Bass industries is toast.
I need to up my game. No pun intended.
Hello? Anybody home?
Epperly, meet my good friend Chuck Bass.
nice to meet you, mr. Bass.
that's Nate. Chuck, we need a favor.
the magazine lost its space for the kickoff party tonight, and Epperly and I both agree the empire would be the perfect replacement.
sadly, the empire is spoken for, - but the palace is available. - The palace...
would lend an air of old-world sophistication to the evening.
I'd have to check with Florence's manager.
do you have a stage?
they'll have one by tonight.
okay. I can get behind that.
and that brings me to another point of business.
Nate, would you show epperly the view from the roof?
it's something you must see.
excellent idea. I need to speak to Blair alone for a moment.
looks like our favorite upper east sinners just found the answer to their prayers.
I need your help.
lucky for us, their road to heaven leads straight through hell.
Hey. Dorota told me you were here.
Yeah, I came by to check on eric.
with my mom away, I knew he wouldn't run into her, but turns out he's gone, too. Want a berry?
no, thanks. I already had breakfast with my new roommate Ben.
what were you thinking?
that he deserves a second chance.
Oh, to what, to drug you and leave you for dead in a motel room again?
that wasn't Ben. That was Juliet, and you know it.
and now she's off doing independent study somewhere, and I don't even think they talk anymore.
look, I understand that you feel badly about what happened and what Lily did, but you can't forget that this guy spent the past six months out to get you.
Ben was a good guy before all this happened, and if you kept an open mind, you'd see that he still is.
you'd see what I see.
what? - You have feelings for this guy.
no. Not that it's any of your business.
it doesn't matter how I feel or don't feel about Ben.
he's made it perfectly clear he wants nothing to do with me.
I haven't even heard from him since the "w" party.
Yeah. I guess i'm way off base.
Hey.
Serena, what's going on?
two guys from Newel just showed up here with a bookcase from ms. Van der Woodsen?
I can explain. I'll be right there.
Hey.
there you are. I have to go now. I'll call you later.
Where's she going? - To see Ben.
that's not a good idea.
tell me about it. What do you mean?
well, contrary to what Rufus and Serena believe, he hasn't changed.
he beat up a friend of mine just last week.
we have got to get rid of this guy, show everybody how dangerous he is.
what can I do for you?
Epperly, my boss.
fashion week just started, so she's a stress case, but my performance review is tomorrow, and I need it to go well.
surely saving tonight will earn you the gold star you crave.
no, it will calm her for a nanosecond until she finds something else to stress about.
I believe that only one thing can relax Epperly, and it's something that I can't give to her.
you need to turn that frown upside down before she pulls out the grading pencil.
and you're just the man for the job.
I'm not sure I am. I've spent the last few weeks trying every trick I know in the bedroom to get Raina to fall in love with me
business reasons, of course. Nothing seems to be working.
that's because that's how you win a guy's heart, not a girl's.
if you want Raina to fall for you, you have to stop pulling on her drawstrings and start pulling on her heartstrings.
and where are they located, exactly?
in a common connection.
you and I bonded over a mutual love of scheming...
and burlesque. Find something that you and Raina both share.
let your guard down.
show her a side of you that no one else sees.
I... Hear girls love that.
open up, and she'll be forced to follow suit.
and once you hook her, reel her in, gut her emotionally and throw the carcass overboard.
you really do have a gift.
so it's a deal.
if I'm focused on Raina,I can't expend energy on Epperly.
that is not fair. I give you gold and you can't spare two hours?
think of her as an amuse-bouche.
you were right, Blair. The view is great up there.
it's so pretty.
Nate... I was just saying how you should come with me and epperly to lunch.
Yeah, sure, I'll go to lunch, as long as Epperly doesn't mind.
no, I'd love that.
so I'm sure Ben was a perfectly nice guy when serena met him, but you lock anybody up for three years...
Yeah, for a crime he didn't commit.
I've seen every episode of "oz." That place can change a man.
all right, so where's this friend of yours?
Hey. - Damien is your friend?
just hear him out, all right?
Eric, the guy's a drug dealer.
who helped you and blair find juliet as soon as he realized Serna got hurt.
Humphrey, personal differences aside, Ben is dangerous.
we all know that. We need to work together to expose him before it's too late.
no. No. My answer's "no." I'm not gonna team up with the one guy I trust less than ben, and neither should you.
did you remember to add the prospectus?
if I say no, will you stop asking me?
we need a unanimous vote tonight, Raina. Anything less, and the Bass board will sense weakness and put up a fight.
you have a beautiful hotel here.
I was just taking a look around.
with Raina by your side, of course. Smile, shake hands, send a message to the Bass board that thorpe enterprises cares about the future of these properties.
set them at ease.
I never thought of that.
okay, do I need to be here for this?
you're right. Where are my manners?
if you'd like the real tour, you can start with lunch at our restaurant.
I, have to get back to the office, but I think it's nice - A Bass and a Thorpe to be seen working together, breaking bread.
besides, there's nothing my daughter doesn't tell me.
shall we?
Oh, I'm-i'm so sorry. I just-I thought
don't apologize. Just return it.
I already called the delivery guys. I can return this, too.
I can't believe you remembered.
I remember everything you've read to me.
in case you haven't noticed,
I don't really let go of things so easily.
I guess I could use something to keep me company at night, but the bookshelf still goes.
I was about to go out and get some lunch. You wanna join me?
I don't wanna raid the Humphreys' pantry, but I'm kinda starving.
well, I told the delivery guys i'd be here, so why don't we order in, if that's okay with you?
I know where the menu book is.
so, Epperly, have you always worked in fashion?
pretty much. After oxford, I worked at the met for Harold Koda at the costume institute.
but more importantly, you were a power Pilates instructor.
for one semester in... College.
but it still counts. Core strength lasts a lifetime.
this is Epperly.
what do you think? - She's cool.
what else?
she's smart, stressed about work.
where are you going with this?
you need to sleep with her right away.
what?
I need you to relieve all that pent-up tension before my first performance review tomorrow, and you better not be selfish, Archibald. You know what I mean.
this is why you've been dragging me around?
well... What's the big deal?
it's not like you haven't done it before.
just think of her as younger, more flexible lady Catherine.
trouble. Florence is stuck at j. f.k.
because the machine's flight is delayed.
well, Epperly, it's fine. We'll send another car.
why don't you two grab lunch, and I'll go get a jump on it at "w"?
no, I need to deal with this myself.
I'll see you back at the office.
I wasn't that selfish, was i? Was i?
you were right. Lunch was pretty amazing.
you'll have to tell justin when you see him.
he's our executive chef.
thank you, Daniel.
the service was impeccable as always.
thank you so much, mr. Bass.
that's the third waiter you've greeted.
Chuck, I know you're trying to make me feel guilty about buying the palace and firing all these nice people, but business is business. You know that.
what's with the show? - It's not a show.
I actually grew up here.
other kids have neighbors and potlucks.
I have concierges and room service.
I know these people because they're my extended family.
I guess I shouldn't expect you to understand.
actually, I do.
when my mother abandoned us, my dad couldn't sleep in our house anymore.
so he moved us into the penthouse of the Blake, and we never left.
nothing like being a guest in your own home.
let me take you out tonight.
there's a party here, then after maybe we can...
some other night?
I have a meeting I can't miss. In fact...
Oh, my god. I didn't realize the time.
I'm gonna get my coat.
I'll call you tomorrow.
okay, you have to try a shishito pepper. - Absolutely not.
my mouth is still on fire from the spicy tuna roll.
now please pour me some tea before I literally start to cry.
look, I'm sorry that I've been how I've been.
I just-I've spent the last three years blaming you for where I thought you put me.
and now here you are somewhere else that I put you.
is that a problem?
no, actually.
I'm beginning to think i'm supposed to be here.
how's everybody doing? - I should get going.
what are you doing? - Leaving.
what is it gonna take for you to see this is a dangerous situation?
what is it gonna take for you to see it isn't?
we're not dating, so if it's all the same,
I don't need your permission or protection.
look, dan, I know you're just looking out for serena, and I understand your concern. I do.
but you have nothing to worry about.
I swear.
watch out, lonely boy.
your new roommate's moving in fast, but you're the one who's going to have to unpack his lies.
Raina's remarkable.
I've honestly never been with a girl who understands me like she does.
no, today was just hard because I was showing her the palace.
I know pretty soon it's all gonna be gone.
it's the one place that still feels like home.
I thought Raina would understand that.
no, I am so sorry, Epperly.
I really thought that you and Nate would hit it off.
no, of course it's not you.
no, don't blame yourself.
he said he thought you were beautiful.
he's just coming off a really crazy relationship, you know?
no, I know. He's as smart as he handsome, isn't he?
don't push it. Wrap it up.
okay. Well, I'll see you back at work, Epperly.
Hey. I'll walk you to your car.
Thanks.
you know, I think I might like to see this place at night.
honestly, it's your loss, Archibald.
okay, so maybe I was too quick to say no about Epperly, but there's no harm in hanging out with her at the party now, - is there? - No harm at all.
Hey. - Hey, Serena.
look, I gotta run. I'll see you tonight, okay? Bye.
you're at home during the day with Nate? Do I smell a scheme?
no, I'm just grabbing a quick bite and a change of clothes for the party.
and you're not coming from school, are you?
no. I saw Ben.
he called me, and we had lunch, and... I don't know.
I think there really might be something there.
am I crazy? Please don't say "yes.
bad boys have never really been your thing, but damaged outsiders are a definite weakness.
what do you mean?
he's from a different social class. Your mother hates him.
he hates your mother. He's living in a loft in dumbo.
I knew Ben before I ever met Dan.
not my point.
just ask yourself this.
is it ben or the idea of him?
taking off. I'll see you later.
Hey, uh, glasses - Middle shelf.
salad plates - Bottom shelf. That's the way it's been my entire life, which is how long I've lived here... With my family.
listen, man, I know you're not too thrilled to have me staying here.
picking up on that, huh? Little bit.
look, when your dad offered me a place to stay, I had no idea that you were living here.
if you want me gone, don't rattle dishes. Just tell me.
I never meant for juliet to do what she did.
I've even told her to give me some space.
well, maybe you should tell her again. I saw she called you.
because it's my mom's birthday. That's the only reason.
like it or not, they're the only family I have. I'm not gonna lose them.
but it's okay for serena to lose hers?
she's already cutting herself off from her mother and eric over what happened.
if you really cared about her, you wouldn't make her choose between you or them.
yeah,'cause that's what you did when you guys were together.
are you saying you guys are together now?
that's her, isn't it?
Hey.
Hey. So I know it's last minute, but I was wondering if you wanted to come with me to the "w" party tonight.
party? Tonight?
you know, if you'd asked me an hour ago, I would've said that's not such a good idea, but, uh...
you know what? I'm in.
great. I can't wait to see you.
Eric: Where r u?
great news. Nate is coming to the kickoff party tonight... And he's very excited to see you.
that's great. Too bad I won't be there. - Why not?
moving the party has been a logistical nightmare, and my phone hasn't stopped ringing, and I can't miss a call.
Cinderella doesn't always get to go to the ball.
well, she can if she has all her calls forwarded to her blackberry and an able intern by her side the whole time.
I'm not saying to blow off your responsibilities, but if anything goes wrong, how can you fix it from here?
it's not a good idea.
you can still do your job and have a fabulous night at the same time.
Nate can't wait to see you.
trust me. It's like riding a very cute bike.
all right, but we have to leave now.
here's my phone. Do your forwarding magic. Different ringtones for different lines?
careful, Ben. Your boss's phone is ringing off the hook, and it's your job on the line.
there's nate. Let's go say hi.
maybe I should go make sure the gift bags are being set out properly.
I'm sure that they're fine. If anyone needs to reach you, you have your phone.
come on. Look alive.
ladies. Epperly, care to join me at the bar?
go get her.
so you go to things like this every week?
if you don't like it, we can leave. I just thought the music would be good?
Oh, no. I'm-i'm looking forward to it.
you thirsty? - Yes, please.
I missed my meeting. - Was I worth it?
I'll let you know.
I took the liberty of reserving my old suite.
perhaps after the show, we can continue your tour upstairs.
only on the condition that you show me something first.
your hiding place from when you were a little boy.
did nate tell you? - I grew up in a hotel, too, remember?
so can I see it?
it wouldn't be so secret if I just showed it to you.
fine. I guess I'll just have to find it myself.
watch where you're going, man. Watch where you're going!
Damien, what are you... Doing here?
this is a party. I go to these. You-not so much.
I told you to stay away from him. - Or what?
not here. - You name the place. I'll be there.
that's not what we planned. You said he had a short fuse.
Damien baited Ben. He just didn't bite.
Eric said you met his parole officer?
Yeah. Why?
you should call him. Parolee's about to get violent at a private event.
to be clear, I'm doing this for serena, and if you turn out to be lying about ben,
I will make sure that you never set foot in this town again.
understood. - I'll be back.
well...
what's this for? - Your hand in about three minutes.
you're gonna punch me in the face as hard as you can.
Blair, have you seen epperly?
Yes, and I can hear my performance review now.
check plus, check plus, check plus - You don't understand.
the party planner delivered all the gift bags to the old location.
well, I'm sure she can fix it. She's right over there.
I don't understand. Where'd she go?
warmer? - Scalding.
excellent.
under the table.
or...
in the corner... By the shelf.
the corner-how on earth did you know that?
I hid in the same place.
you can see everyone, but no one can see you.
I even carved my name in the wall with a salad fork.
the old wood floor was replaced by tile in the last reno.
otherwise, I could've shown you my work.
see? I know you better than you know yourself.
I know how much the palace means to you.
it's your home.
I think I can keep you from losing it.
Raina... Before we go any further, there's something I have to tell you.
don't bother. Allow me.
dad, wh-what are you doing here?
I should ask you the same question.
how dare you miss the meeting.
I told you, we needed a unanimous vote.
I'm sorry.
but I'm not even sure if we should buy bass industries anymore.
Raina... One of chuck's associates called our chairman tonight.
Chuck knew about the vote.
he kept you away on purpose.
is this true?
no, I wish you guys could have seen it.
Hey, Ben, I want you to meet Shala, Humberto, and Jen.
Hi. - How are you? Humberto.
uh, look, I think I'm gonna take off.
Oh, I'll come with you. - No, you should stay.
I mean, your family's here...
Eric, what are you doing here with... Damien?
what happened to your face? - Ben.
he threatened me earlier, and then he followed me to the bathroom, and then he jumped me.
Eric, are you kidding me? There's no way.
no, he did it. I saw it myself.
don't even try to deny it. I can see that look on your face.
sorry, s. , your new beau may have the right to remain silent but you just became the talk of the town.
I don't understand. It doesn't make any sense.
why would Ben just come and hit you unprovoked?
the guy's obviously got some serious anger issues.
and his parole officer just happened to be here? Come on.
no, I called him. Because you knew that he'd hit Damien?
because I knew he was a danger to you, to me, to anyone he came into contact with.
I tried to tell you all this, but you wouldn't listen to me.
because I don't believe it, and I don't believe you.
Serena, wait.
and in the dark wait.
did you really know our board meeting was tonight?
tell me the truth. - yes.
raina, when we first met,
I was so desperate to save my father's company. I didn't care what it took, who I had to betray.
I thought if you fell for me, you might find a way to spare it.
but after spending today together,I realized how much I actually do care about you.
I'm so sorry, Chuck.
there's nothing you can ever say to make me trust you again.
my father's waiting for me.
I won't be able to get you in front of a judge till morning.
let me guess. You're not springing for a room at this place.
this is serious, Ben. I'd hoped for better from you.
wait! Stop. You're making a mistake.
Serena, don't. - I know you didn't do anything. Tell him.
Nate, where's Epperly? We're having a gift bag crisis.
how should I know? She left with this guy she knew from oxford.
what? How could you let some toff just punt off with her?
he's definitely gonna try and hook up with her. You should've heard this guy's accent.
epperly was right.
you can't take your eye off the ball. I need to fix this.
let's go. You are gonna help me get 650 gift bags from 29th street in 20 minutes, or so help me, Archibald, I will tell everyone what your favorite movie is.
Hey, do not knock "the sound of music. " It's got nuns and Nazis.
Julie Andrews was hot.
so I say we go back to your place, pop in some "call of duty" and celebrate.
listen, man, I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but I think we're pretty much done here.
I don't understand. I...
I thought we were... Friends.
you're my client. Former client, actually.
so you were just using me to find out where ben was so you could get rid of me?
and now he's gone, and so am i.
see ya.
what happened?
are you seriously mad at me now?
well, I can't say i'm entirely pleased.
you put Max Cady in my living room. What was I supposed to do?
I guess I didn't realize how deeply you felt about it.
I know you got a lot on your plate right now. It's gotta be hard for you to be caught in the middle like this.
well, I'm sorry I didn't ask you first.
I thought I was doing the right thing.
uh, you were.
Ben didn't hit damien. I - I did.
Oh, my god.
Spotted-a lonely boy trying to save an innocent man.
looks like Brooklyn's the one who's guilty... By association.
Hey, have you talked to Eric? - He wasn't here when I got up.
I wouldn't be surprised if he was off somewhere with Damien.
I don't know what to do, how to get through to him.
it's gonna be okay. I'm meeting with nate. We're gonna take care of it.
uh, I've gotta call you back.
I don't know where to begin.
how about "i'm sorry"?
I didn't think that would be enough.
I'm pretty easy. - Well, then I'm sorry.
honestly, I don't know what I was thinking. I was jealous. I was angry.
I cost you a night in jail.
what's one more after three years?
thank you for calling my p. o.setting the record straight.
I'll pack up my stuff. - No, you don't have to move out.
in fact, I would like you to stay.
I realize you're someone I should trust, just like serena said I should.
she said that?
Yeah. If you don't believe me, you can ask her yourself.
Hey. Dan invited me to come over and wait for you.
she was right. I was wrong. Just give everyone else some time.
they'll come around.
I need to go meet Nate.
where have you been? - I was just getting coffee at sicaff? I- I got you one, too.
you should know that, um, Dan and Nate are on their way over to Damien's to look for you.
Yeah, well, Damien ditched me after the party, so...
strongest drug I'm on is double macchiato.
are we done? - No, no, no. We're not.
talk to me. Make me understand why you wanna spend so much time with a guy like him when you have all your other friends.
what other friends?
can't believe I'm gonna say this out loud. It sounds so stupid, but I...
I thought damien got me.
you know, we could just hang out together and do nothing.
he was there for me.
that kind of a guy always is.
Yeah. Yeah, well...
lesson learned. Thank you.
blair: You owe me!
for what?
a speechless Chuck Bass. Will wonders never cease?
honestly, I never thought you'd talk to me again. - Neither did i.
but then I got a phone call from your friend Blair.
not a staged call - A real one.
she told me you may have said all those things on the phone with her for the wrong reasons...
but that you also meant them.
when it comes to me, Blair has a nasty habit of never being wrong.
she said the same thing.
so I've decided to ignore my better judgment and give you a second chance.
if you ever lie to me again - You have my word.
business is business. You need to do what's right for thorpe enterprises.
I'll find another way to save my family legacy
one that doesn't involve you.
I would...
but I can't right now. I have a meeting.
dinner tonight?
room service.
from: CHUCK Thank you.
epperly's been in with Stefano for over an hour.
but... It was just gift bags.
and we still got them there on time.
this is all my fault.
I wanted epperly to get laid, not laid off.
did you get fired?
of course not. The party was a huge success.
are you having a psychotic break?
no, but I am taking a break. I quit.
Blair, at the party, I ran into the guy that I dated when I was living in london, and we spent the whole night together-just talking.
and he is heading off to Bali to a yoga retreat, and I...
decided I want to go with him.
you're leaving the magazine for "eat pray love"?
I guess you can't have it all. - No, of course you can.
don't quit. You're amazing at your job.
I know, and you will be, too. - What?
as a token of my appreciation for helping me see what was missing in my life,
I suggested that you be promoted to replace me. Congratulations.
Stefano's giving you a trial run, starting now.
this is the office, international, stefano only.
now your day begins every morning at 6: 00 a. m. With the milan conference call.
no, no, I am a full-time student. I go to columbia.
if james franco can do it, so can you.
Blair, you wanted it all, and you just got it.
they say the universe has a great sense of humor, that sometimes having your dreams come true can feel like a nightmare.
the board is waiting for us.
raina, after last night, I need to ask if I have your full support to buy bass industries.
Yes, under one condition.
name it. - After the deal closes,
I want you to give chuck a chance to be part of the new company.
I don't need Chuck's help to run Bass industries.
Yes, you do. You just don't know it yet.
because getting what you want always comes with strings attached.
CONCULATE GENERAL OF BELGIUM Archibald, Humphrey. What are you guys doing here?
well, we came looking for Eric. - We ran into your dad instead. He's a nice guy.
I mean, at least he was to us.
how he is to you after what we told him might be a different story.
wait. You guys realize what you've done?
my dad's gonna cut me off!
and even when you think you're finally in the clear, you're never home free.
you haven't slept.
I couldn't, not until I knew you were safe.
last night at the party when everyone else doubted you,
I never did, not for a second, and I never will.
what about your family?
what if us being together drives them all away?
gossip girl here -
your one and only source Into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
Vanessa said if I helped Rufus, it'd help me get you.
he's under the impression you tried to sabotage me,and you happen to make a perfect villain.
my goal was to destroy Chuck.
my uncle is my worst enemy.
Chuck tried to cover up the truth about my mother.
this one is from 8: 00 p. M. The night of the fire. - What's on it?
Bart having an argument with a woman-- Avery Thorpe.
my father and Avery Thorpe were having an affair.
I'll explain it all in person.
I look forward to meeting with you, too, Jack.
don't think I don't know it was you that sent princess sophie That scrapbook from "gossip girl."
without the royal court's approval, it means even more.
will you marry me?
you'll never marry anyone else. You're mine.
I said it's over. - No!
mom, I have some news. I'm engaged.
good morning, sleepyheads.
looks like "dream until your dreams come true
wasn't such a good idea after all.
so I thought I'd bring some luxury across the river.
Brooklyn needs it.
it's all bars, bakeries, and babies. No hotel in sight.
Charles place. You up to attend the ribbon cutting?
no, thanks.
still pissed I lied to Raina about my father.
Yeah, well, it was a big lie... Even for you.
that's why I'm stepping out from under his dark shadow and away from the Bass name.
whatever you wanna call yourself or your hotel, You're still the same person.
and with everything going on, I still need my best friend by my side.
I saw what you did to Blair.
going to stay with Raina for a while.
if you walk out, don't be here when I get back.
don't worry. I'm already gone.
Really? You're trying me again? Does that seem like it's gonna work?
you answered. - You're right. My bad.
wait. I know you don't like me, but can you at least Acknowledge that everything I told you was true?
your point?
you didn't need to have Your cousin make me look like a crazy, jealous bitch to Dan.
Oh, you don't need any help with that.
she said I manipulated her to ruin Rufus' business dinner.
you're telling me that innocent cousin charlie Came up with that by herself?
I'm saying you probably did whatever she said you did.
if charlie's fighting back, good for her. She's learning.
good-bye, Vanessa.
green. - Yellow!
that's 0-for-4. Okay, let's try sour patch kids.
I thought we were gonna have breakfast. - This is breakfast.
when I was little, Sour patch kids were pretty much my best friends -
them and books. - Books. Oh, me, too.
what was, uh, what was your favorite?
I could try to be cool And make something up, but if I were honest...
flowers in the attic. " My copy literally fell apart.
Really? What was it that you loved most, uh, exactly?
was it the gripping tale of teen incest or just the general Fine quality of the prose?
Oh, my god.
I totally should have lied and said Fitzgerald.
I can tell he influences your writing,
um, especially that story in "the new yorker."
was that about Serena?
uh, yeah, yeah, that was back when I was on the outside,
not getting my own personal invitation To the constance/st. Jude's black tie alumni fund-raiser.
Yeah, it's, uh...I wasn't gonna go, 'cause I wasn't exactly The most popular kid in high school,
so why relive that, right? But then I thought, you know,
maybe--maybe if you came with me, it'd be fun.
Yes! Are you kidding? Yes!
Blair is having This little engagement toast beforehand,
and she invited me. I figured I-I should go, so you want to meet me there?
I'd love to.
so... Here comes the future princess.
now... What does that make us, I wonder.
well, as of now, nothing.
in choosing me, Louis gave up his succession rights.
well, fortunately, we are here to throw you An engagement party, so maybe we can fix that.
well, while this looks delicious, I thought we agreed on a champagne toast.
Oh, of course. This...
is the vitaminwater design competition With the c. F.D. A.
me and joe zee and the vena cava girls - We are the judges, and we will be picking The final t-shirt from a young designer To complete the collection.
we can be launching someone's career.
well, let's keep our attention on my future, shall we?
I really want the princess to understand That Louis can have me and his rightful title.
not to worry. I happen to be an expert mediator.
Serena, did lily get those dresses that I sent over?
you know, the maxi ones from last year's collection?
I'm on my way to spend the day with her, so I'll ask.
and be back in time for the engagement party, I hope?
or not.
I'd actually like to be engaged when it's over.
Blair, I'm sorry I sent those blasts to louis' mother,
but everything worked out great, so can we just enjoy it And move on, please?
like much else in your life, that apology was underwhelming.
good to see you, Eleanor.
you must be Jack. Thank you for getting here so quickly.
it was nothing. Your father and I go way back,
which won't stop me From inviting you to have is little chat Someplace more comfortable - your hotel room.
I see the Bass family resemblance.
so...
what's this about that old building my brother burned down?
I just found out my mother was in it.
I didn't even know she was dead until recently.
but now that I do, I want the revenge my dad never got.
Chuchas proof That my mother's death wasn't an accident.
he's been covering it up ever since he found out.
while I... love making my nephew suffer,
what, besides entertainment, is in it for me?
the reins of Bass industries.
you know all the right things to say, don't you?
what the hl?
Nate, I'm sure you know Jack.
Yes, unfortunately, I do, But why do you?
I'll be in touch to discuss details.
should've known you'd still be ding On my ney ew's leftovers.
you brought in Jack Bass?
is that panic's art? That looks great.
Yeah. Hey, um, your mom called, and, uh, she was concerned that you were due for a refill on your medication and didn't get it.
shoot.
I was so excited About going to the fund-raiser tonight with dan That I forgot to pick it up on my way home.
I'll go right now. - I already did.
uh, your mom told me that last time things went well, You stopped taking them.
and then they went from well to hell.
trust me, I never want that to happen again.
okay, neither do we. - You have nothing to worry about,
unlike me who has no idea what I'm gonna wear tonight.
new york is always so gray, even in the spring.
and the angles everywhere-- they are so harsh.
I'll be happy to be back in Monaco.
the "glenn ligon: America" exhibit at the whitney Is definitely worth the trip.
there's nothing gray or angular there, except the building.
I think I've had my fill Of your city's ugliness for this trip.
mother, please.
I'm sorry for the way Chuck behaved with the royal court. He's out of my life for good,
and you can rest assured that my family and friends Are nothing like him...
most of the time. - I suppose.
I will see for myself this evening at your party.
and I was also thinking that we could go To my alma mater's fund-raiser tonight afterwards.
didn't one of Caroline's bastard children Go to that school?
or was it Albert?
Blair, do you know? - I-I-I'm sorry.
I just remembered that I have to get my dress for tonight altered.
I lost weight in the whirlwind romance,
so, um, would you mind if I take a rain check for tea?
of course. We'll see you tonight.
she's lying.
about losing weight? - I had her followed.
if you are going to give up the throne for this girl,
the least she can do is give up her bad habits for you.
the first place she went after you asked her to marry you?
to see Chuck Bass.
has in common with marie antoinette is impeccable taste,
or she just might lose her head before she gets her crown.
I can't believe how amazing these parties look.
Oh, that's the constance/ st. Jude's fund-raiser.
it's a shame we're missing it this year Since my mom can't go.
actually...
Dan invited me.
Oh, that's--that's great. - Are you sure?
you said that you weren't seeing him,
and I can call right now and cancel if you want.
don't be ridiculous. Dan and I are barely even talking.
I've never been to a black tie affair before.
if only I had something to wear.
your mom's been super generous,
but I can't put a dress like that on her black card.
wait. What about your trust fund? You're over 18.
why haven't you gotten it yet?
maybe grandma and my mom's issues are worse than we thought.
no, I bet that that's not it.
my mom and Cece have basically gone "celebrity rehab" On one another and she's never held it against me and eric.
let me call and find out.
you're like my fairy godcousin.
I'll let you get started.
well, look who finally came to her senses.
concierge at the empire said that you were here.
Louis and I are still very much engaged.
then why are you here with me?
I'm risking my well-being To tell you your uncle Jack is in town.
I saw him myself this afternoon.
I just came to warn you so you could prepare For whatever it is jack is planning.
and how will I ever prepare for what you're planning?
I should go. Can't be late for my engagement party.
already so royal,sensitive to the suffering of her subjects.
you have no idea what I've been going through since that night.
just be careful.
and all this time, I thought you hated bart because of his sunny personality.
I see you've spoken with my daughter.
and apparently you haven't.
no. She's holding on to some anger about this whole situation.
can't say I blame her. Doesn't mean I wanna do business with her.
which is why you called me.
what Raina's proposing suits me fine.
it's just, your daughter's history with Chuck, Nate Archibald crashing our meeting,
looking like he just ran away from home
the whole thing feels messy, juvenile.
I couldn't agree more.
what did you have in mind?
my nephew is at the edge of a cliff again.
nothing turns him upside down like losing blair waldorf.
all he needs is a push,
and I'll have the men in lab coats waiting to catch him when he falls.
let me know what I can do.
you can start by paying for drinks during which we'll discuss what else you'll be paying for.
Yeah, you know, there's one more thing.
I believe there's a box Chuck is protecting in his suite.
I'm guessing it's where Bart kept mementos, Letters from my wife.
it would mean the world to me If I could have those things for myself.
I'll make sure you're well compensated.
I'll make sure you get a key.
looks like someone got their trust fund.
thank you for vouching for me.
I got a loan from the bank of cece until my official checkbooks arrive.
I've also fallen in love with Nina Ricci, or whoever designs her dresses.
Ooh, let me see.
Oh, shoot. It's my mom. I better get this.
I'll show you later? - Of course.
Hi, mom. I just got the most amazing dress For this fund-raiser at st. Jude's tonight with dan.
uh, with my trust fund.
no, don't be mad.
everything's perfect. I promise. Nothing's wrong.
no, I'll talk to you later.
I don't think that's what the doctor had in mind when he said,"use as directed.
how can you have an engagement party without the prince?
Oh, right. He's not one anymore.
I invited you to attend, not to speak.
here, try the '91.
did you know that princess Sophie Is an avid ornithologist, just like me?
I cannot concentrate on vintage With you droning on about insects.
my dear...
ornithology is the study of birds, not insects.
I'm Cyrus Rose, Blair's stepfather, and this is my wife eleanor.
princes Sophie, Welcome to our tasteful and appropriate home.
thank you. - Now I'm a hugger. Hope you don't mind.
princess Sophie, I apologize for not greeting you properly.
o est Louis? - He said he would meet me here.
this is good work. I figure two weeks. Excuse me.
your highness, you'll forgive me if I'm too busy to bow.
I don't appreciate the sarcasm,
or, for that matter, anything else about you.
then we're equal. - Except I'm not pursuing your fianc.
I know Blair came here to see you. - Maybe your fianc is pursuing me.
I highly doubt that, After you humiliated her in fro of the royal court.
so why don't you tell me what's going on?
shouldn't you be asking Blair that? - I want the truth.
if you can't trust blair to tell you the truth, you've got bigger problems than me.
all I'll say is get used to it. Blair is nothing without her secrets.
W if you'll excuse me, I have a real foe to fight.
what did you do to your hand?
it will heal with time, unlike you,
who's facing a lifetime doubting Blair.
what are you still doing here? - Uh, bringing mom dinner.
she's in a bidding war for a vintage Birkin on Ebay and can't leave the computer.
but don't you have Blair's engagement toast? I know you both have your issues.
I cat force blair to want me there.
but come on. It's Blair.
she might have trouble saying it most of the time,
but she loves you as much as she loves anybody.
of course she wants you there.
Hey, sorry to barge in, But I'm thinking about going to Blair's party after all.
I just wanted to check that there's a dress in my closet.
no problem.
Ugh, this is terrible. I can't even decide how to wear my hair.
do your feet hurt after wearing heels all night? And does Dan dance?
do you prefer lipstick or lip gloss?
okay, breathe. Lipstick lasts longer, but gloss is more fun.
Dan does love to dance, but he's terrible at it, so no laughing, and your feet won't hurt as long as you have just the right amount of champagne.
other than that, just be yourself.
that's what I did at cotillion, and Dan and I had the most magical night ever.
and your hair looks great down.
I-I can't reach Louis, and I've barely had any time to bond with princess Sophie
thanks to Cyrus' kibitzing.
she looks like she's enjoying the conversation.
your stepfather is wonderful, Blair.
Yes, I loved him at first sight. - no, you didn't.
his knowledge of birds is magnifique.
perhaps I judge you too harshly after the consulate affair.
Cyrus has told me of your job at "w" and your straight "a" average
all while dedicating yourself to avian welfare.
you would never let a duck go hungry.
and you do make Louis very happy.
you and Louis may make your first formal appearance as an engaged couple this evening, if you like, at constance/st. Jude.
your first royal appearance.
I have ways of swaying the court.
there are certain dalliances That they would rather not have exposed.
it feels like we're family already.
but what is this?
it's true what they say about diamonds.
they cut not only glass but porcelain as well.
did you hear the good news? - I did.
let us all raise a glass to the newly reinstated prince and princess-to-be.
may your lives be as full of love
as the skies are of birds.
we need to talk.
your attempt to destroy me will have to wait. I have a meeting.
Oh, I'm not doing anything... Except getting you the help you need.
little unsteady, are we? It's okay.
it's understandable you'd succumb to substance abuse after all you've been through -
a mother who scammed you for profit,
a stepmother who cut you out of your own company,
and, of course, the love of your life Leaving you for a monarchy smaller than Manhattan.
you're forgetting my uncle
that made me choose between my legacy and the love of my life.
Ah, yes. Blair did jump at the chance To sleep with me again, didn't she?
what the hell's going on? Get ahold of yourself.
look who rode in on his high horse to tell me I told you so.
I'm coming to make sure you're okay.
I don't need your pity! Get out of the way or get hurt!
first Blair, now me? You do need some help.
which is why I've brought it. - You can't be serious.
after everything you've done, I'd have to be insane to not want to beat the crap out of you.
Yeah, well, they have experts who'll decide that.
now you either go with these gentlemen,
or I'll call the cops and file a civil suit against you.
sorry, man. You should go. It's the only way.
Nathaniel, you're making a grave mistake.
sedate him if necessary now.
Oh, and I guess you won't be needing this.
we hear one bass is hitting bottom.
nicely played.
feel free to take whatever you want, Including precious works of art.
looks like the hotel Isn't the only charles that needs rehab.
Hey. What'd I miss?
Oh, Cyrus charmed the princess Into returning louis to the throne.
but he's upstairs waiting to talk, and he didn't seem happy. So I should probably go.
Blare., I know you don't believe me, but no matter how much we fight,
all I've ever wanted for you is true love.
I'm--I'm sorry that it took me so long to realize that.
you--you deserve this.
well... It's not as if I haven't done my share of subversion.
Penelope would've gotten far too much satisfaction out of being the maid of honor.
spotted-- a lush headed for lockdown.
let's hope this bass can survive on dry land.
you okay?
I know I shouldn't care, but I'm worried about him.
not tonight. Go be a princess.
rehab is probably the safest place for Chuck and your engagement.
Hey, you came. - So did you.
I mean, that's--that's all right, right? We're good?
Yeah. I mean, Blair's getting engaged,
and--and you're taking charlie to her first black tie event.
so... Seems everyone's moving on.
thank you.
Oh, I'm sorry it took me so long.
but now we can finally celebrate you getting back your rightful place in your family and the country.
Blair, I know you saw Chuck.
well, I...
I wanted him to hear about our engagement from me.
twice?
and I had to warn him that his evil uncle was in town.
all of which sounds very noble, so why didn't you tell me?
you--you know we have a history, so I was worried that...
you'd think it meant more than it did.
I saw him before I came here.
if he told you something happened, he's lying. He's just trying to get you to leave me.
I saw his hand.
it's not the ring that cut your face.
Blair, how can you lie to protect someone who hurt you?
since I'm not seeing him again, There's no reason to earrass him.
I think you're the one who's embarrassed.
you have your own dark side.
I understand if you want to end it.
it's very unbecoming of a princess.
I want you, Blair.
but the only way it will work Is if you show me all of the parts of yourself,
even the ones you're ashamed of.
maybe if we don't talk about them, they'll just go away?
I hope you'll join me at this party to make your formal debut.
if you're not ready to share your life--all of it-- Don't show up.
I'll leave with my mother tonight.
Hey, I'm worried about charlie. She should be here by now.
forget I asked.
take your coat?
that's my dress.
gentlemen.
what the hell is going on? - Divine intervention...
if you consider satan divine.
you did get in one good punch. - It was a long time coming.
he was the one who reached out to me to help.
you see, as much as I love to screw with my nephew,
your using me to do it just didn't sit right.
so on that tape you just put in your jacket pocket...
I mean, I knew you didn't just want to read your cheating wife's love letters.
all that was in that box was evidence against my father.
even if he went to the authorities, the implications are limited on a dead man.
so we played follow the leader. Unless you're into arson porn,
there's obviously something else of interest on that tape.
Bart murdered my wife. I can take my story to the press.
first, you'll stay for the viewing.
the time code is after my father left the building.
you're the one who locked the doors.
my father didn't set the fire that killed your wife.
you did.
Hey, you look great. You want to, uh, you wanna grab a drink before we go?
you should have asked me If you wanted to wear my cotillion dress.
I mean, you can borrow anything you want, But you do need to say something.
this isn't your dress. I got this at Nina Ricci, remember?
you do have a lot of dresses, Serena.
Pamela Dennis made it especially for me. I think I would know,
and so should you, since you were my date.
uh, I bought this myself. I wouldn't steal from you.
Oh, okay, then let's see the label.
well, it's... In your mom's garbage. It was jabbing me in the back.
I mean, I think I still have the red mark if you wanna see that.
no, no, whoa, whoa. Stop, stop, stop. Come on.
there are a million gold dresses.
Yeah, but there's only one with a pamela dennis label cut out.
take it off. - This is obviously a misunderstanding.
why are you defending her? You are not leaving here in that.
if you didn't want me to go to the party with Dan, You didn't have to humiliate me.
okay, Charlie, this has nothing to do with Dan.
good. Then you won't mind if we leave together... Now.
you know, I was trying to take it slow with Charlie
because I value our friendship so much, but...
can we just call the cops?
I'm hungry, and all you seem to have are olives and hallucinogenic mushrooms.
you have to believe me.
it was an accident.
Bart and I were partners.
I had proof that he was planning the fire,
so when I found out he was sleeping with Avery, It was the perfect setup.
I was trying to keep my family together.
by killing the mother of your child?
I swear to you, I thought it was bart in that building.
I knew no matter what I said, he would never let avery go.
it sounds crazy, but... I still loved her.
and she loved you?
I read the letter she wrote to my father ending things.
that letter was for me.
Bart called and said we needed to talk,
that I should meet him at the building.
that was when I decided that he wouldn't be leaving.
that's what Avery and my father were arguing about on the tape?
she wanted to tell you in person she loved him.
unless we're clo to the end of this sob story, I'm gonna order room service, okay?
your father and I made an agreement.
I wod keep the proof of his involvement in the fire a secret.
I would give him the company, the insurance money, and go back to chicago.
and he would say that he was responsible for the accident.
he always felt guilty about avery being there.
I can't choose my entree with hallmark hall of fame playing in the background.
I 'm calling the cops. - Please
I'll pay.
I'll give you thorpe enterprises, anything you want.
but I can't let Raina find out what I did.
I'll give you the same deal he did.
Oh, hey, girls, can we at least get my plane fare home out of this?
get out of new york and never come back.
thank you.
if Raina ever found out, I don't know what I'd do.
Blintz?
no, thank you. I've lost my appetite.
well, how is that possible?
you're returning to your alma mater as the princess bride-to-be.
you and Louis are practically giddy about each other.
not when he finds out who I really am.
you mean a brilliant and beautiful and...
Remarkably-strong- for-her-stature young woman?
you may not be aware of this, but it's not all light and bright in here.
there are some places devoid of even a hint of sparkle.
Louis will love those, too, one would hope.
Chuck was the only one who ever did, but he couldn't see the rest.
Louis says he wants it all, but, ugh, what kind of a princess schemes
and plays sex games and dreams herself into old hollywood movies?
well, uh, pretending as your stepfather That I didn't hear the sex games part,
the truth is...The only way that you're gonna know if louis is the one is to tell him everything.
but what if he doesn't love me after I do?
take it from someone Who is head over heels for a waldorf woman...
even everything is not enough.
you're late. - I know. I'm sorry. Something came up.
it was really important, but not that late. What's wrong?
Jack Bass called. He's backing out of the whole plan, says he just used me for the free flight.
well, that's jack for you. I told you he couldn't be trusted.
Really? We're talking about my payback for my mother's death,
and you're "I told you so"-ing me?
raina, punishing chuck's not gonna bring your mom back.
Chuck knew Bart murdered my mother, and he sat there
and watched me get my hopes up about that waitress,
and he tried to ruin my relationship with my father. He should pay for that.
okay, I know you're upset, but you have to Trust me on this.
Chuck didn't do anything wrong.
first Jack, now you? What the hell's going on, Nate?
I just think you've been through enough pain without digging up more.
I am not stopping until chuck feels as bad as I do.
Chuck's father didn't kill your mother.
yours did.
you gotta take that?
no.
they say love is the best medicine -
that is, unless you don't take it.
your dad was a nasty son of a bitch,
but I never thought for a second he'd actually gone o. J.
well, thank you For using your evil powers for good this time.
Ah, it was selfish, really.
I didn't want anyone else playing with my punching bag.
dysfunction is best kept in the family. It's true.
plus what would I want with a company someone else owns half of, or a building in Brooklyn?
now if you still had Blair, things might be different.
on that note, I'm going to cut this reunion short
and try to find her before the nice guy actually wins.
I'm counting on you not to defile the Bass name
and lose her to a family of titled circus performers.
I know what you did, dad.
honey, what are you talking about?
you're the reason my mother is dead.
did, uh, Chuck Bass tell you that? He's lying.
he's trying to cover his own guilt.
why don't I come and take you to dinner, and, uh, we can talk about it?
don't come near me.
the only one lying is you my whole life.
raina, please.
you're as dead to me as my mother is.
thanks for coming.
I couldn't resist finding out What you think we have in common,
but unless it includes an apologyi'm not staying.
you accused me of getting charlie to turn Dan against you.
well, she just did the same thing to me.
you think Blair's behind it? I mean, Dan's a good kisser, but that good?
it's waldorf-level scheming, But blair's in love with her prince.
this was all Charlie.
Hey, Serena and... Vanessa?
I'm not even gonna ask what the two of you are doing together,
but have either of you seen Charlie?
I don't know why being back here Makes me feel like I'm on the outside again.
Oh, you know why? 'cause you're the only one talking to me.
what's up, Kati, is?
nice to see you girls back together again, Still dressing alike.
do you hear something? - No, nothing.
come on. You must have had some fun in high school.
mm, not in actual school, no.
so you never did anything crazy
like blow up a toilet or spray paint lockers or...
try to get some behind the bleachers?
no, I was pretty much the anti-crazy.
we're gonna have to fix that.
you know, I was in here once after a swimming pool incident. It was not the good kind of crazy.
well... That kind is better.
you shouldn't leave high school without doing it on a desk.
call me Serena.
what?
whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait a second.
I think maybe this is not a great idea.
queller is not known for her sense of humor, and, um...
why don't you get dressed?
and I'll meet you outside.
Oh, have you seen a prince?
Yes, I am engaged to him, and you should be green with envy...
but I don't have time to make you wallow in it because I have to take this call.
Hello?
of course.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Serena's cousin. Thank god.
uh, I just got a call that Chuck needs me.
when Louis arrives, will you tell him that I was here and that I'll be back?
whatever you do, don't let him leave.
a dream is just a dream, or is it?
so when you say Charlie went off her medication,
you don't mean because the doctors told her to?
no, her mother said it happened once before last time she was happy.
ended pretty badly.
a place where fantasy and reality collide.
Chuck Bass. What a disappointment.
I was rooting for you.
have you seen the real Blair? - Don't you read "gossip girl"?
you lost her to the prince. - Not yet, I haven't.
I told you he wouldn't let her get away.
everything you ever wanted seems possible.
excuse me, sir.
someone called me from the building and--and told me that Chuck Bass was up here.
he was threatening to jump and asking for me.
I'm Blair Waldorf.
until you realize The nightmare's just beginning.
gossip Girl here -
your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
you accused me of getting Charlie to turn Dan against you.
well, she just did the same thing to me.
your mom told me the last time things went well, you stopped taking them.
and then they went from well to hell.
call me Serena. - What?
let us all raise a glass to the Prince and Princess-to-be.
I hope you'll join me at this party. If you're not ready to share your life, don't show up.
Chuck Bass. What a disappointment.
have you seen the real Blair? - Don't you read "Gossip Girl"?
you lost her to the Prince. - Not yet, I haven't.
you're the reason my mother is dead. - Did Chuck Bass tell you that?
my nephew is at the edge of a cliff again.
nothing turns him upside down like losing Blair Waldorf.
uh, someone called me from the building and - and told me that Chuck Bass was up here.
he was threatening to jump and asking for me.
well, at least now we know why Charlie's been acting so unbalanced.
Yeah, because she is. We need to find Dan before something happens to him.
and we need to find Charlie before something happens to her.
you know, this isn't her fault. She needs help.
the last time this happened, she ended up wandering through the snow in her bare feet.
Yeah, after she "single white female'd" her college roommate.
Rufus said the girl's boyfriend led her on.
fine. She's in your dress with your ex, but if you're so concerned about Charlie, you find her, and I'll find Dan.
you know, maybe I should be the one to tell Dan what's going on.
at least he considers me a friend, which is more than you can say right now.
and whose fault is that? - Yours.
you know what? Let's--let's not do this.
why don't we both tell Dan together? And we'll both find Charlie together.
fine. Let's go.
look at this place. We've been-- we've been gone two years? Feels like 20.
is raina here? - No, she's not. She, uh, asked to be alone.
is everything okay? - Not really.
you seem a little shaken up yourself. What's going on?
Charlie said something that kinda weirded me out.
I'm hoping it's just a crazy misunderstanding and not actual crazy.
What'd she say? - Uh, well, uh, we... were kissing, you know?
and then things started to, you know... So then she says,"call me Serena.
Yeah. That's... another long story.
what, we're at St. jude's, so now suddenly I'm back out of the loop with everything?
look, I'll tell you later, I promise.
ms. Waldorf, I can't find Blair.
well, she's bound to be here somewhere. She left well before me.
Oh, there's the Princess and Louis.
do you think she'd miss the opportunity to enter her old stomping ground on the arm of a prince?
she is finally getting her fairy tale.
she doesn't need the big bad wolf to ruin it.
why don't you say good-bye once and for all?
and let her go.
Oh, hey, you know, if school was more like this during the day, I think I might have enjoyed it.
thank God my student days are almost over. - Have you seen Charlie?
Hey, we need to talk. - We need to talk to you.
I need to talk to you. - Hey, I need to talk to you.
okay, whoa, just tell me that no one's trying to stop a wedding, run a Ponzi scheme, give anybody fake cancer, or turn into a justifiably vengeful townie?
usually I'm the one trying to get all of you people to listen to me.
as much as it pains me to think you might know the answer to this question, do you know where Blair is?
what we have to say is far more important than the location of Blair Waldorf.
Yeah, we think Charlie's in trouble, and we need to find her.
at least you're okay, though. I was worried about you.
Chuck, you gotta listen to me. Raina
I was worried about you, too, but, you know, now we're both worried about Charlie.
Nathaniel, I can't even think about raina until I know where Blair is.
everybody, please, shut up.
I haven't seen Blair, and I've been around the room a couple times tonight.
but whatever Nate needs to tell you is--is obviously important, so I think you should hear him out.
as for Charlie, she has been acting a little strange, and I haven't seen her. I'm looking for her, too.
what are you two doing together? Don't you hate each other?
you tell him.
a half hour ago, I saw Blair talking to that girl wearing Serena's dress, and then she just bolted.
Nathaniel, if you still need to talk to me, I'm going to the empire to see if Blair's there.
right behind you.
look who got cute. - Uh, still gay.
that means you can dance.
so what's up with Charlie?
I don't understand. I specifically asked you not to tell raina the truth.
I had no choice. She wanted to go after you.
if she confronted her father with any of this, now he will.
there will be repercussions, believe me.
until I find Blair, I can't even think about Russell thorpe.
you might have to. I'm sorry for just showing up like this. I didn't know where to go.
my father was so angry, blaming you for all that's happened.
and after everything that I put you through, I just wanted to apologize.
no need to apologize to me.
we both did things we didn't know were wrong in the moment.
still. - Thanks.
Blair isn't here, is she? - No, and I've been here at least a half an hour.
so if she's not here, she's not at home or at the party, where is she?
Hello?
I don't understand why you're doing this.
you tricked me into coming to Chuck's new hotel by saying that he was in jeopardy, and now you won't let me leave.
what am I supposed to do, jump from the third story window?
come on. I know where Blair is. Smart girl.
you and Chuck might not be together, Ms. Waldorf,
Waldorf, but from what I can tell, you're still the thing he loves most in the world.
you're not going anywhere tonight.
bonsoir, upper east siders.
are you enjoying the party as much as I am?
I know one person who isn't.
and this is our beautiful milo.
he's 10 months old, the little guy.
O. M.G. So cute! Is he sleeping through the night?
00 till 6: 00. I get up with him so Georgina can sleep in.
your life sounds perfect. - It is.
so how did you two meet? Well, that's a real romantic story.
Phil wanted a hot wife to impress his partners, and I wanted a loft and a legacy at Yale for milo.
now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go get drunk enough to make you all seem interesting.
Oh, of course you'd be here.
Oh, I can tell that you're up to something. Please let me in on it.
I haven't been this bored since I believed in Jesus.
if I was up to something, and I'm not saying that I am, the last thing I would want is Georgina sparks getting involved.
not unless the thing was twisted and nasty, in which case my help could prove invaluable.
how's the party?
Oh, I promise, mom, you're not missing anything, unless you think Amy chua trying to convince headmistress queller to grade her kids more harshly is exciting.
check your e-mail.
thank you. You're a good son.
is that Eric at the party? - Yeah.
Hey, Eric, have Serena and Vanessa found Charlie yet? - I don't know. Why?
uh, well, she's gone off of her - don't embarrass her. She'll be fine.
um, look, um, if you see Serena, have her give me a call and check in, okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'll find her right now.
Oh, Mrs. Harrington, Mr. Harrington, I'm so sorry.
Charlie, put down the bottle.
what are you doing? Why are you even here?
Oh, obviously it's a mistake if you're anywhere near me.
listen, maybe... I-I think I overreacted before.
I mean, what you said-- it took me by surprise.
but the more I think about it, the more I get it. You just want me to like you.
well, I already do. So what do you say about a do-over?
we can go somewhere and just talk about this? Come on.
Yeah, why did you lead me on for weeks?
why didn't you just tell me you didn't like me?
I mean, is that something you learned from Serena Because-- excuse me, sir.
all right, we need a plan "b.
Serena. - Oh, headmistress queller.
have you met our distinguished alum cecily?
we've never met, but I've read a lot about you.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Bye. - So... how is Providence?
I'm at Columbia, actually. - What happened to brown?
uh, well, I deferred for a year, and then when it was time to go back, my dad helped get me into Columbia so I could be close to my friends and family.
Oh, I know I was always hard on you, Serena, but it was only because I thought you could become something.
I had hoped you'd leave New York, see the world, maybe find your place somewhere far away from all this.
Oh, well, maybe after college.
what's wrong with you? - Excuse me?
please don't tell me you're gonna lecture me about my choice of college, too.
college? No.
but how could you not end up with Nate or Dan?
we both voted on "Gossip Girl's" poll, and we both lost.
so who did you end up with - the billionaire, or the guy who tried to kill you?
neither, actually.
I used to wanna be like you, but now I wanna be Blair.
at least she's going to be a Princess. - Okay, shoo.
I'm perfectly happy with my life, but thank you for your concern.
Oh, spoke too soon. I'd ask how you are, but I don't really care.
I'll take that as an opportunity to answer anyway.
I mean, I-I'd say I'm great. Look at my hair, my clothes, my body, but I've actually become a bedford wife, and it's really just the worst thing.
please let me in on whatever scheme everyone seems to be a part of.
I haven't conspired since I convinced Dan he was milo's dad.
unless you count speeding up the process at a hospice to get someone's apartment.
A-anyway, I-I'm sure I can be useful. - Not to me.
I had Charlie, but she slipped away. She's gotta be around here somewhere.
I'm sorry. She's a part of the gang, but I'm not?
mine's from Charlie. - Mine, too.
I'm sorry. Good-bye"?
who is this amateur? - Serena's cousin. She's in trouble.
we have to come up with a new plan.
the badger. Th-the melon drop.
the Spanish prisoner.
divide and conquer. She could be anywhere.
Yeah, I'll, uh, I'll go to my dad's in case she goes home.
I'll go to the loft in case she shows there. - I'll stay here in case she comes back.
okay. What do I do? - You can just go away.
I don't understand.
if you're not gonna torture me or wh-whatever, why don't you just let me leave? And why do you keep doing that?
cause it's taking longer than I thought. - What is?
she said she was on the third floor.
do you smell something weird? Like... - Gas.
I'm calling 9-1-1.
I turned it on before you got here, but this place is big and drafty.
don't, don't!
I... I-I know you think the Basses are evil.
trust me. I get it.
I loved Chuck for so long, and...
he just punished me for it.
he ended up treating me like something he owned instead of something he earned, and it destroyed me.
I-I thought I'd never get over it. But...
I finally found a way out of the darkness and...
you can, too. - No, I can't.
don't! Stop!
dad? - Raina. You shouldn't be here.
neither should you, but if you go through with this, you're taking me with you,'cause I'm not leaving without you.
I know you didn't mean to hurt my mother.
the fire was an accident.
I forgive you.
you're going to jail for a very long time, and I won't be coming to visit you, ever.
this just in--Blair Waldorf m. I. A.At constance.
doesn't she know her Prince is waiting?
or has she found a new one?
Nate and raina are giving their statements to the cops.
you sure you don't wanna go to the hospital, get checked out?
I'm fine, or I will be.
I just wanna get outta here. Louis is waiting for me.
I'll drive you. - Thank you...
not only for the ride but for, you know, saving me.
what was I supposed to do? You called.
only because I couldn't see my phone to dial 9-1-1.
I still have you on speed dial. I just had to push down the 1.
the 1, huh?
I'm so sorry. - I know.
how about a drink to calm your nerves?
then we can return you to your Prince as steady as ever?
okay. One drink. That's all.
thank you.
Nate... I wanna go home.
okay. We can, uh, get another cab, go to your hotel.
I don't mean the hotel.
you mean Chicago.
Oh, my. - Closed for Joseph nitzberg's bar mitzvah.
the nitzbergs have great taste. - Maybe we should just go back to the party.
Why? Pretty much everyone we or Gossip Girl knows is there, which means it's almost like we've been given the rest of the night off to do what we want.
like that movie "death takes a holiday"?
not the Brad pitt remake. That was horrible.
what? It was.
Helen and Murray erlich" sound nice.
shall we?
you scared me. - I get that a lot.
do you know where I could find a window that opens?
most of them seem to be nailed shut, and I could really use the fresh air.
top floor, last room at the end of the hall.
thanks for helping me.
have you seen Charlie?
maybe I have. Maybe I haven't. - This is serious.
every second you don't tell me where she went is critical.
look, what if your kid in 17 years was in trouble and needed help?
if milo isn't in trouble in 17 years, then I've done something wrong, but fine.
I'll tell you where Charlie went, but you owe me.
she took the elevator.
thank you.
I miss you! You get me!
Charlie. You here?
so that's it. Time to go back to the real world. You ready?
I'm sorry, my dear, but you need to give this up. Blair isn't coming.
you asked her a question, and this is her answer.
you know, the last thing I wanted was to see you be hurt.
and look what has happened.
I know she'll be here.
no, Carol. I'm sorry. We still haven't been able to find her.
I'll try Vanessa, see if she had any luck. - Okay.
no, we have everyone looking.
watch out, s. We find what we look for... - Charlie.
but never where we expect. - Charlie, no.
Charlie, what are you doing? Please come down from there.
I heard you talk to Dan and Vanessa about me.
you think I'm crazy. Everyone does. - No, we don't.
we think you have a condition that can be helped.
if you come down, we can talk about it. I-I'll get Dan if you want.
Dan doesn't like me. That's why I stole your dress.
I'll never be like you.
you're... Serena Van Der Woodsen.
that doesn't mean what you think it means.
you okay? You didn't call when you got in. Is Charlie there?
no, I'm sorry. I just... I got caught up.
I found your book. - My what?
inside. " Dan, it's-- it's incredible.
you went through my stuff? Vanessa, you have no right to do that.
I know, and I'm sorry. It's just this could be the best satire on the Upper East Side since "bonfire of the vanities.
how long have you been working on this?
uh, five years, off and on.
now put it back, and we can forget you found it.
I always thought Serena was the reason you fell into the Upper East Side, but it was more than that.
Vanessa, seriously, this is none of your business.
you always wanted in, maybe more than Jenny.
of course, the irony is that if I ever show it to anyone, it'll guarantee my outsider status forever.
Dan, you know as well as I do you can't be an insider and make great art.
you have to stand alone to observe it and not care whose feelings you hurt or what people think of you.
those people are my friends, my best friends, my family.
well, it's not like any of them come across worse than you do, and there's a certain someone that might actually like the way she's painted. And I'm not talking about Serena.
get it published. Take a stand. Be a great man instead of always being a good boy.
Serena found Charlie. I need to go.
and you need to put the book back and get out of my room.
Dan, this is important. Don't just drop everything to run and help them.
good-bye, Vanessa.
when are you gonna realize that you are better person until the day you asked Serena out four years ago?
when are you gonna realize that I had a better life before you climbed up my fire escape four years ago?
so... - I should find Louis and tell him it's over.
if that's what you want. - It's the right thing to do.
you really love him, don't you? - Yes.
but not like I love you. Louis and I-- it's different.
it's lighter, more simple.
he makes me happy. - And I don't.
what we have is a great love.
it's complicated, intense, all-consuming.
no matter what we do and how much we fight, it'll always pull us in.
what's mere happiness in the face of all that, right?
so... I'm sure Louis has left the party by now, so I'll have to tell him at the consulate.
drop me off at constance, then you can take the limo.
are you really going to tell me that there's something wrong with being you?
every girl wants to be you. Every guy wants to date you.
you can do anything you want. - So can you.
all night, I-I've realized, I didn't choose college.
I never chose between Dan or Nate. I didn't even choose Paris last year.
Blair told me I was going. Trust me, I-I know what it feels like.
when you're not making your own decisions, you can feel helpless because you don't wanna hurt anyone.
but all you end up doing is hurting them and yourself.
it's what I did, and here I am, alone.
you're not alone.
I'm here. - Good.
but if you could do it over again, who would you choose?
Dan or Nate?
what are you doing?
you're still here. - Why wouldn't I be?
the party's almost over. - I know.
but Blair hasn't arrived yet. - How can you be sure she's even coming?
because I love her, and just as important, I believe in her.
I know she's scared, but she'll figure it out.
and I'll be here when she does.
you left your... - I knew you would come.
I'm sorry it took me so long.
we need to talk.
no, I need to do this myself.
- What's she's trying to say is you have my blessing.
I couldn't be more happy the two of you are getting married.
don't you know timing is everything?
looks like someone just stepped on your lines.
Hey, what are you doing up here?
meeting Serena. You, too, huh?
why do I feel like we've been here before?
Hey, how you feeling? - I'll be okay. Thanks.
so what are we doing here? - I owe you both an apology.
did something happen I don't know about?
no, it's not what happened. It's what didn't happen.
last fall, I asked you to wait around while I figured things out, and--and I never really did.
so I'm sorry if I hurt you both.
I-I hope you can find a way to forgive me. - Of course we can.
we already have, but it means a lot to hear it from you.
I'm sorry, too, for everything I did that caused problems, but especially for the way I acted with you, Dan.
all right, well, what do you say we get your coat? I'll take you home.
I'd like that. Thank you.
maybe I shouldn't have wanted to be you before, but now I definitely do.
I'll get our coats. - I'll get a cab.
Hey, I should call my mom and let her know that I'm okay.
okay. I'll be down there.
Hey, it's me. I thought you should know it went perfectly.
I'll see you soon.
did you find that open window?
Yeah. But I shouldn't have been looking for it anyways.
I, um, was just off my meds.
no, I don't think so. I don't think you were ever on meds.
don't worry. I'm not gonna bust you.
since I assume you're about to be shipped off somewhere, if you're ever back in the city, let me know.
it's been getting a little dull around here.
why did you just do that?
cause of what you said earlier. - About being happy?
Chuck, that's not the most important thing.
people don't write sonnets about being compatible or novels about shared life goals and stimulating conversation.
the great loves are the crazy ones. "L'amour fou.
Blair, we're not living in Paris in the '20s. - We both wish we were.
there's a difference between a great love and the right love.
I left the empire state building last year after two minutes when you didn't show.
Louis waited all night.
this is your chance at happiness.
you think you shouldn't want it 'cause you've never had it, and it scares you.
but you deserve your fairy tale. - We make our own fairy tales.
only when we have to. You don't.
how do you feel about tonight?
awful. Just... Terrible.
in fact, I've never felt like this before.
guilt. I feel it, too.
maybe I'm actually growing up after all.
I didn't wanna let you go just yet.
don't let anyone tell you you're not powerful.
you're the most powerful woman I know.
it's taking all the power I have to walk away from you.
I know.
but I need to let you go.
you need to let go.
I will always love you.
I will always love you.
I had to say good-bye.
this just in
Chuck Bass and Blair Waldorf, happily never after.
they say parting is such sweet sorrow, but wouldn't it be nice if just once it didn't have to be?
they're saying 20 years.
sounds fair. That's how long he kept the secret.
well, I wouldn't wanna be in his shoes. I can tell you that.
what about your shoes? When is that happening?
Yeah, what are your plans for the summer, Mrs. Humphrey?
well, I'm going to be getting very pale. This thing doesn't come off until the fall, just in time to send my baby off to college.
Oh, Sarah Lawrence is, like, 15 minutes away. I don't really think I need to be sent off.
a-a light breeze could take me there.
at least you don't have to worry about sun damage, and we don't have to spend the month of August with Eleanor and Cyrus on that cruise like they suggested. Can you imagine?
I don't think the principality of Monaco's yacht counts as a cruise, Mr. Humphrey.
well, they didn't mention that. Maybe there's still time to r. S.V. P.
well, on that note, I think I'll head out, Nathaniel.
I'll hitch a ride.
so... Monaco for the summer.
Yeah, Louis is picking me up in an hour.
flying private? - Is there anything else?
so you're really getting married, huh? - Yes, and you're actually going to be invited.
I bet you never thought you'd get to go to a royal wedding.
only my own. You think you could introduce me to Charlotte casiraghi?
listen, if the castle gets lonely, um, you wanna watch a movie with a friend...
I already copied your queue.
our e-mail discourse begins Monday with hal ashby's "the landlord,
and we'll take it from there. - Okay.
Hello?
uh, it's your car here to take you to the bus.
are you sure you wanna take the bus, honey?
Yes. After everything I've been through, I could really use the downtime.
my mother was right. This city isn't the best place for me.
maybe someday I can come back and stay centered, but for now, back to Florida.
thank you.
I'm sad. I kinda liked having a cousin around.
me, too.
I really did like you. - I really did like you, too.
transitions in life are usually marked by major events -
birthdays, graduations, weddings.
you must really be hurting. - How can you tell?
you're not drinking.
I always know it's serious when even you know you can't dull the pain.
I'm not righrifor her. We bring out the dark side in each other.
when she's with Louis, she shines. That's the Blair I love.
if she needs to be with him to be it, then that's the way it should be.
well, look at that-- Chuck Bass, maturing.
sad but true, I'm afraid.
I had Victor pick this up.
being at St. jude's reminded me of all the lost weekends we used to have.
so why not graduate to a lost summer? - I'm intrigued.
just spin the globe and pick a point. We can start there and make our way back here, like old times--bachelors who don't have to answer to anybody.
you're a good friend. - One of us has to be.
but the greater transitions often come out of smaller moments...
when we stop and look at who we are.
because each time we see how far we've come, we also see how far we still have to go.
Hey, can I borrow your sun hat?
only if I can take your espadrilles.
I can't wait for Monaco.
strolling in the jardin exotique, catching the exhibits at villa Paloma, while I lay on the beach in Montecito, off the radar, learning to surf, strolling through the farmers' market, while Cece with a teacup of gin in hand, harasses the help.
well, you're gonna have a lot of fun, but are you sure you wanna be all by yourself the whole summer?
I know a palace with an empty room or 50.
being alone is just what I need--no boys, no bars, just a bottle of sunblock and a dozen of the best beach reads.
I needed to make a choice, and--and I choose me.
well, who knows? Maybe the grimaldis' yacht can moor for a couple days in Malibu and we can meet up.
Oh, I'd love that.
Hey, have you picked a date yet? - We're thinking November.
well, that doesn't give me nearly enough time to find a dress to outshine yours, - and you know I'll be wearing white, of course. - What are you talking about?
I already told Louis' seamstresses to make you a maid of honor dress from the brightest fuchsia they could find.
thank you. - Of course.
you don't think you're gonna get a little stir-crazy?
not really. I'm producing panic's album in the city, so I'll have lots of company.
what about the house in the Hamptons? I mean, is Cece gonna be there this year?
no, she's staying in Montecito for Serena.
you know, I'm actually ashamed to admit this, but I was kinda looking forward to spending some time out there.
since when do you like the Hamptons? - I wouldn't mind leaving the city.
it's been getting me down.
you sad about Charlie leaving? I know you two were getting close.
it's not Charlie he's talking about.
whoever or whatever it is, the Hamptons house is empty.
you can have it all for yourself.
would you wanna come with? We could be each other's wingmen like Nate and Chuck.
maybe break up a couple or two.
uh, yeah, thank you. Get me outta here.
who knows? With all the, uh, relaxing you do, maybe you can get a little writing done while you're there.
I don't know. I think maybe, uh, my writing days are behind me.
you were right. I loved it. So did my team here.
we think it's one of the best debut novels since Jonathan Safran foer. Who exactly wrote it?
I promised my client I wouldn't say, but I'm sure once it's published, the author will come forward. He'll--he'll have to.
where should we send the checks?
to me. I'll pass them along to the author.
Barcelona? - I'm moving there.
nothing's really keeping me here.
in order to fully transform, we might need to free ourselves of everything we've been holding on to.
to sends us on our new path-- the right one.
sorry. - Do we know each other?
no, no, no. It's just "the beautiful and damned"-- it's one of my favorite novels.
I can't believe you were reading it.
normally, people only read novels around here because they're trying to turn them into movies, so...
which is exactly what you're doing, isn't it?
I kind of lied to my boss about having already read it.
I'm supposed to do a scene-by-scene comparison of the book to the script. Meeting's in an hour.
any chance you could help me?
well, I don't know how I feel about helping someone cut corners.
but if it's for the good of FitzGerald,
I suppose I don't have to meet my grandmother for another hour.
let's see. How far did you get?
not far enough. That's my boss.
Hey, what are you doing here? - Oh, my gosh. David o. Russell.
I'm David. - Hi. I'm Serena. I'm such a huge fan of your work.
are you turning "the beautiful and damned" into a movie? - Thanks.
well, I'm trying to turn "the beautiful and damned" into a movie.
do you have the notes for the meeting? - Almost.
almost? We gotta go. - I understand. I've been working on them.
no, you're not. You're talking to a beautiful girl, which I understand, but -
beautiful things only grow to a certain height, - and then they fail and fade off. - You read the book.
Yeah, of course. I-I read the book. - You read the book. She read the book.
I relate to it more than I should admit.
I got an idea. We got the beautiful and the damned.
so this is not your assignment now. If you want a job... - Oh, my God. I can get this done.
well, she actually read the book, though. What do you think?
if you can prepare me for the meeting... - Um, yeah.
how was the trip? - It was long, but nice.
they're all in there. You can count...
thank you, Ivy. You played your part perfectly.
well, thanks for hiring me.
I have to say it was... A pretty devious plan.
well, you met my family. You know where I get it from.
at least now they won't come looking for my daughter.
you gonna be all right going back to your real life after having been a part of that world?
I think I'll be fine. - Good luck.
but if at the end, you find the person you've become is not the person you want to be...
you can always turn around and try again.
and maybe the next time, you won't be so alone when it's over.
too late to turn back now.
gossip girl here...
your one and only source into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
how about a tour? - Absolutely.
it is my house. Don't you think you should be the one to go?
actually, this is my house. Nice to meet you, by the way, um...
Nate. - How would you like to keep working for me?
I would love to.
I have to say it was a pretty devious plan.
thank you, Ivy. You played your part perfectly.
one month anniversary of our move.
Ivy, stop talking to your boyfriend and start working.
Charlie! Oh, my gosh! - What are you doing here?
why would Vanessa steal your story? - To teach me a lesson.
people write songs about wiping out on our l. a. Roadways.
I'm not scared of anything.
do they know? - Know what?
how far along you are. I'd say... Six weeks?
I'm not pregnant. - Lie to me all you want, but your body will be telling the whole world the truth by the time of your wedding.
rise and shine, upper east siders.
it's time for your annual checkup.
lucky for you, doctors take their confidentiality seriously around here.
are you sure this doctor's reputable?
your prenatal care is imperative.
you never care about my womb before.
maybe this is way to avoid seeing Mr. Louis off on trip to Monaco for feast of assumption holiday.
Louis' sister Beatrice is picking him up at noon in their jet, which gives us plenty of time to discuss your gestational issues.
Dorota, how are you feeling? - She's fine.
I'm blair, dorota's employer. I have a few questions.
just go with it. Is only way.
I need to ask you how long her morning sickness will last.
as I'm naturally empathetic, the mere discussion of food...
not to mention the odor, the taste...
it should ease off in the first trimester.
and... What about breast sensitivity?
miss Blair! - Is the one asking the questions.
you see, she practically screams when anyone touches them.
I can hear her all the way from queens.
Sensitivity's totally normal.
okay. And, um, how long till she can determine the father of her child?
she's had a few one-night stands with the staff of our building.
Blair cornelia waldorf! - You two should work this out.
Dorota can come back another time... Alone.
I'm sorry.
I - I don't know what's come over me.
Yes, you do.
you are pregnant, too. We are like sisters now!
cousins. Distant cousins.
miss blair, why you not say you are...
do not utter the word. No one must know.
well, at least not until I have some time to figure things out.
I don't care what you say. I hug you anyway for luck and keep secret.
I'm sorry. It's not you... - I'm so sick of all you guys on antidepressants.
it's a good thing you don't offer satisfaction guaranteed, or she'd be your third refund this week.
do you need pharmaceutical assistance? - Yeah, I wish weed was the answer.
I meant viagra. - no, Everything works down there.
it's here that's the problem. I just can't stop thinking about that woman from l. a.
it's understandable, given your mother issues. She called twice.
she did? Did she leave a number or at least her name?
last I heard, it was Anne Archibald.
Yeah, well, in an attempt to take some of your advice about my future,
I asked my mom if she could help me get an internship this fall.
schumer and lloyd blankfein at goldman are both interested, and now she wants me to choose.
so call your mommy. Pick either job.
forget about your mysterious lady from l. a.
if a woman wants to see you again, she generally tells you her name.
what happened to the son helping the father make breakfast?
you've been on that computer since you got here.
I know. Sorry. I'm... I'm trying to figure out which publisher has my book so I can stop it from coming out.
and jeremiah harris wasn't any help?
no, no, the only clue I have is this, uh, check vanessa sent me.
I'm sorry. I'll be one more minute, and then I will be in there to burn the bacon, I swear.
um, listen, I know you're probably on your way to surf or hanging out at cameron diaz's house, but, uh,
I was wondering if you could share some of your bank breaking secrets with me.
well, I thought you did all your scheming with blair.
no, she's not speaking to me.
I just need, um, to help vanessa with a bounced check, and I can't reach her.
I was thinking that, you know, whatever you did to get into lily's safe deposit box might also work for me.
Oh, well, that was all chuck.
he slept with the girl at the bank.
but knowing him, there are many more girls at many more banks.
you should ask him.
right. Chuck. Okay, thanks.
so are you really staying out there?
well, I got a great job, and charlie's here.
Char-charlie as in "call me serena" cousin charlie who moved back to florida?
Yeah, who's actually been living in l. a. One and the same.
I'm about to go to brunch with her and make her fill in all the blanks.
well, don't be too quick to option her life rights before you make sure she's back on her meds.
but in all seriousness, tell her I said hi.
Bye.
and for my final course, a hot peach clafouti, inspired by my hot girlfriend ivy.
Oh, three michelin star, definitely.
which... Of these scream "i am a new york city trust fund baby" more?
those, I guess.
you okay? You seem extra nervous about this audition?
Yeah.
some days it's just not as much fun trying to be an actress.
well, at least we're failing together.
unlike jason... He just got this huge chef gig at beast in portland.
Hey, it's cheap, too. Moving there could end my days of plating salad with dressing on the side and save you from using your mysterious emergency fund.
Max, I told you, this is my last resort. There's only enough to use it once.
I know. It's just, I don't want to end up like everybody else who comes to l. a. With dreams only to find that l. a.is the place where dreams come to die.
or you get those weird lips that everybody here has.
let's not give up yet.
I promise things will get better.
I wish you could join me for the feast.
the church celebrates with all of monaco's favorite foods to honor virgin mother honest rise to heaven.
why aren't you waiting to greet princess beatrice at the elevator?
I know you two will love each other.
don't be so sure.
my first impression on grimaldi women thus far has been abysmal at best.
unlike grimaldi men who fall in love the moment they see you, but don't worry.
my mother and beatrice never agree on anything.
they make the brothers of brunel look civil.
at least we don't have harems. - Ah, la voila.
Louis... - Me, too.
Beatrice, this is blair.
you are even more beautiful than the photographs in the paper.
the perfume...
it's jasmine and clove oil from africa. Do you like it?
it's powerful.
then I shall give you mine. I'll get more when I go back.
I've always longed for a sister.
sit, sit. Tell me everything.
okay, spill. What are you doing in l. a.
and how did you get your mom to agree to let you come here?
she didn't.
I call her and I tell her that I'm okay, but not where I am.
trust me, it's better this way.
florida was making me crazier than new york ever did.
and you're being responsible with your medication?
I needed a break from my mom, not reality.
well, florida's loss is my gain.
okay, I wanna know everything! Friends, boyfriends.
neither, honestly, which is why it's so sad that you have to go back to new york for school.
well, then I must be a genie,'cause your wish is granted.
I'm staying.
I thought that your movie ended.
Oh, it did, but the producer offered me a job, so I'm meeting with her later today to discuss the details.
but don't worry. We'll have plenty of time to catch up before then.
they say misery loves company, but sometimes it's the company that makes you miserable.
my. Look at the time.
I'm so disappointed that I can't spend all day with you before you rush off to your principality.
you know, blair, I feel just the same, which is why I moved our flight to this evening.
we now have all afternoon to share our secrets like real sisters, and I want to know them all.
I can't wait.
now if you'll excuse me.
but nothing's worse than company that overstays their welcome.
good luck, b. Have fun being the hostess with the mostess.
I get working for this producer's a huge opportunity, but what about columbia?
well, I'm taking the semester off, and I'll see how things go after that.
my only issue is living with cece.
last night, at 2: 00 a. m.her bridge game turned brutal.
a neighbor even came and complained.
well, I'm sure your real estate agent will find you a great place.
well, hopefully near you.
in fact, why don't I have her just meet us at your place?
it's a bad idea. My roommate barely lets me in most days.
and he's kind of howard hughes-ish.
Hey, I was just about to call you.
I'm gonna need to see 2-bedroom apartments instead of one.
okay, great. Thank you. - No, my place is fine.
no, it's not negotiable. This is l. a.
Rhodes girls have to live together. It's tradition.
come on. Let's go.
Hey, chuck. - Ignore him. He's not with me.
Oh, hey, hey, do I need to call the cops?
this isn't what we signed up for. We're outta here.
just... I expect a full refund.
what are you doing? You okay? - I was until you arrived.
uh, you don't... You don't look all right there.
no, no, I have the address. I just need her name, okay?
th-then why are you called "information," huh?
I'm not serena, humphrey. I didn't need saving.
I thought you were still in the hamptons.
I'd ask you how your summer's going, but seeing you with chuck, I guess the answer is probably "weird.
Oh, it gets weirder. I found him paying some really rough dudes to... To fight him.
he wasn't forthcoming with the details, but I...
I would imagine it's some new bass-type scheme to get blair's attention.
well, he said he was okay about her all summer.
or maybe it's finally hitting him now that we're back.
I think something else might have hit him, too.
he was already pretty bruised when I got there. I think he might need to see a doctor.
yeah? Well, my mom has this concierge doc she could send, but calling her means i'd have to decide which internship I want.
well, I could stick around and talk it through with you.
I was also kinda hoping to get some help from chuck on something anyway.
Hey, I'm gonna call a doctor, have him check out your bruises, okay?
excellent.
listen, I'll just, uh, call you when the doctor leaves. How about that?
all right.
well, what do you say to a little shopping for all your pre-wedding events?
Yes. I was thinking wu for my welcome parade... Short but regal.
and alaia would put charlene and her swimmer's body to shame at albert's ball.
those will never do.
Why? They only use children to sew the beading.
you cannot have bare shoulders, exposed knees, anything form-fitting.
too much skin borders on bruni.
I- I-I don't understand. How am I to become an icon of style and taste if I can only wear a burka?
I'm sorry. The dress code is mandated.
so you get balmain, and I get to be barbara bush.
how is this possible?
it's one of the many perks of being the non-reigning sibling.
I'm surprised to hear you say that.
I read the interview you did for "the guardian" when louis gave up his seat for me, and you seemed more than eager to step into that role.
I admit I've always wished for my mother to realize she had two capable children.
but those few days with the world watching my every move were too much.
you, however, are much better suited for the pressures of royal service than i.
shall we have a snack?
actually, I need to find a restroom.
I'm not sure there's enough closet space.
you're kidding, right?
I didn't think it was possible for anyone to need more closets than I do.
I mean, you have a whole room for your shoes alone.
Yeah. But, you know, the... The beach traffic can get really bad, and that might depress me even more than my crazy roommate, so...
maybe I should... Just stay where I am.
so you're gonna give this place up because of traffic?
where in l. a. Is carmeggedon not an issue?
I already have other interest. If you want it, you're gonna need to move quickly.
Oh, I can give you a down payment right now.
except I forgot my checkbook.
but you have yours. I - I saw it when your purse fell.
Yeah. But, you know, I don't think I have enough to cover two months' rent.
unless you bought the maldives without telling me, you should have plenty.
or is this your way of telling me that you don't wanna live with me?
of course not.
all I have is an out-of-state check.
no problem. Just put your local contact information in the memo.
see? I told you this would work out.
you understand fractured ribs aren't something to mess around with.
you could end up puncturing a lung.
I told you, they don't hurt.
I have a hard time believing anyone has that high a threshold for pain.
Yeah, well, he's probably just self-medicating.
you should see his medicine cabinet. Some of that stuff's not even legal in mexico.
no, I was just... I was just kidding.
he claimed he couldn't feel my touching his ribs during the exam.
if he's taking that many drugs, someone needs to keep an eye on him to make sure he doesn't take any more or do anything other than rest.
his injuries are bordering on dangerous.
I'll take care of it. Thank you.
I wish we'd stopped at saint honore.
doesn't shopping leave you famished?
well, perhaps buying one lipstick doesn't build up the same appetite.
lucky you can eat at your feast.
I'm sorry. Too much coffee. Give the virgin my regards.
I'll show you to door.
and by door, I mean elevator.
over there. - I think it's fairly obvious.
our future princess has developed a drug problem.
what? No.
uh, miss blair too much control freak to use mind alter substance, even to help mood swing.
I admire your loyalty, but no one uses les toilettes so often unless they have something to hide.
Louis deserves to know what it is.
I swear, miss blair just... Have sensitive stomach.
of course.
I knew I recognized that faint acrid smell from boarding school.
the pale skin. Not eating in public.
blair's obviously bulimic.
Yes. No. I... I mean, not... Not anymore.
only teenage habit of using restroom die hard.
but miss blair digest everything now.
I go make... Tuna melts for both of you.
Louis? We need to speak right away.
what are you doing in new york, at my house?
leaving, by the look of it.
whoa, were you trying to find me? Oh, this is fantastic.
I haven't been able to stop thinking about you either.
can't believe you actually tracked me down.
Oh, that is borderline adorable, but I wasn't here to see you.
as of recently, I own "the new york spectator,
and I wanted to interview your mother for my inaugural article on the disgraced wives of dirty businessmen, but she not-so-politely declined.
okay, wait, even if this is a coincidence, it's a pretty damn good one.
all right? I was here just to discuss job offers with my mom, but I would much rather take you out.
Oh, we had fun, nate, but I need more than just stamina to keep me interested.
nice seeing ya.
whoa, whoa, wait. Will you at least tell me your name?
what's so important it couldn't wait until our 7-hour flight tonight?
your fiancee is bulimic. - Is that all?
bulimia is a serious disease.
Blair told me all about her teenage struggles. It's in her past.
past hour. She's not well, louis.
or she needs an escape from a shopping trip full of rules. She told me about that, too.
I was just trying to prepare her for the pressures of your life.
the stress will be the worst thing for her condition, all so you can claim a title we both know you don't even care about.
you know I'll do whatever I have to to ensure blair's well-being.
but believe me, she's doing great. There's nothing to worry about.
you never did understand la psychologie des femmes.
I guess I will just have to prove it to you.
go ahead. I will prove you wrong.
Hi. Yes. This is charlie rhodes from earlier.
turns out that serena and I have changed our minds about the apartment, so if it's okay with you, i'd like to come back and get my check.
miss rhodes, your check was invalid. The bank told me it was no good.
I'm sorry? I gave it back to miss van der woodsen when she brought me a new one.
maybe you should speak to her about this.
saltines only thing I eat for months with ana.
well, that was not the same.
your people are bred to work through these conditions and give birth in a field.
no fields in krakow.
and I have birthing suite at lenox hill.
well, I am too exhausted to even reprimand your insubordination.
at least she and prince louis gone. You have time to figure out...
don't even let the word leave your lips.
you never know who could be lurking.
Louis. Darling.
Ah, I was just about to take a nap because I was so exhausted from that shopping trip.
so romantic of you to come and say a final good-bye.
Beatrice didn't want you to miss your first monegasque holiday.
and that is so kind.
I'm sure the virgin will understand that I'm too busy to be away.
which is why I had our priest arrange to celebrate here in new york.
he's already spoken to the local church.
I hope you're hungry. It's called the feast for a very good reason.
let's hope b's first feast of assumption doesn't end in damnation.
back again? What don't you get? Unlike serena, when I rejected you, I meant it.
Nate asked me to keep an eye on you while he was out.
and while I'm here, I was wondering if you could help me with something.
the answer is no.
and what did you do when the doctor said you're not supposed to go out?
well, if you're willing to fight me over it, we could strike a deal.
well, that kinda defeats the purpose of making sure you don't get hurt.
there isn't a chance in hell you could hurt me.
Chuck, I know you saw the blast about blair and louis going to the event tonight.
it's not worth puncturing a lung to get her attention.
blair's attention is the last thing on my mind.
come on, man. You do something dangerous.
gossip girl" reports it. Blair comes to your rescue. Some might call that a pattern.
Humphrey, you know nothing about our situation.
well, I do know that blair is over you.
you weren't even the last one to kiss her before louis. I was.
while her lips may have brushed yours, the last person she was with before she left was me.
I'm referring to full carnal knowledge.
a kiss is just a kiss.
that hurt? Wish I could feel it.
poor lonely boy, excuse me, ma'am, I think you were fired from this establishment.
I want to go to portland.
if this is about your audition, you can't let one bad experience make you give up on your dreams.
my dreams will never come true if we stay here, but yours could if we leave.
I thought about it, and you were right.
let's go before we're forced to leave.
okay, if you're sure. I'll tell the manager when she gets back from break.
Hey, this is gonna be good. I can feel it.
we'll be like bonnie and clyde.
without the killing and robbing and car chases.
I'm gonna go home and pack. - Okay.
I must have gained 10 pounds last year. It's so delicious.
Louis. - Mon pere.
I am sorry we missed you at cap d'antibes this summer.
well, your missionary work is more important.
Blair, this is father cavalia, the man who will marry us.
Bonjour. - How wonderful.
well, I'm so sorry you can't be in your own church on this devout day.
perhaps if you got on the plane right now, you could make it?
don't be silly. This way, I have a chance to get to know you away from all my duties.
did you enjoy a religious upbringing, miss waldorf?
my family's of mixed faith, but I've always appreciated a confessional.
in fact, I'm gonna go find one right now.
as you know, the confessionnelle is not available during a celebration.
genial. Have you ever tried a barbagiuan?
Mmm, my favorite.
it's filled with pumpkin and spices and butter.
it's delicious.
I can't help it. I love those.
je vous salue, marie.
surely the virgin mother can show mercy to those on earth still suffering while she rises to heaven.
I - if you'll excuse me, I see a lost soul in need of guidance.
thank you. I will never question the paternity of your child again.
I told you. She can't even keep down one bite of barbagiuan.
you're starting to sound like mother.
but unlike her, who doesn't care about anyone but herself, i'm trying to save your fiancee. Why aren't you?
Blair, hey, listen, I know you don't wanna see me right now, probably not ever, but I'm not here to cause problems.
I can't say the same about chuck. Have you seen him?
walk with me.
well, thanks for coming back, diana payne.
Ah, you found the card I left for your mother.
please tell me it was her who texted me to come back here and not you.
Oh, she's right inside. - So why are we out here?
her text said she'd relented and agreed to talk to me for my "spectator" article.
she did. There are just a few final details that need to be worked out first.
I know. She has a concern that I'm turning the "spectato" into a tabloid, but I'm very happy to give her story approval.
wait, wait, wait. What about me? I mean, I am the one who convinced her, after all.
I mean, don't you think there should be some sort of, you know, finder's fee?
are you trying to trade my interview with your mother for sex?
well, I would've called it a date, but yeah, basically.
how do I know your mother's really inside?
well, you can watch me open the door and tell her that we'll be back in an hour.
what makes you think we need that long?
stamina.
Serena. What are you doing here?
I got your address off the check that the realtor gave me.
I'm sorry. I... Was a flake and forgot to look at my balance.
okay, but you can just stop. I know what really happened.
out. The princess needs privacy.
my security detail will escort any of you who are not willing to go out on your own.
security detail?
what's going on? Blair, I thought you were mad at me.
and you have my forgiveness if you shut up and guard the door.
it's not like you to forgive me or run away from a feast.
might this have something to do with you sleeping with chuck?
how in the world did you know that?
forget it. I don't even have time to care.
what don't you understand about "guard the door"?
I can't believe that I thought you changed last year, and since you didn't, chuck is now going off the deep end trying to get your attention again.
no, now that's where you're wrong. Whatever he's doing isn't about me.
he was the one who told me to marry louis, and he meant it.
now you're gonna be sorry you didn't guard.
are you... Are you gonna go with me in here?
I'm not sure our friendship can handle that.
"friendship" is a tenuous term. Now be a gentleman and... Run the water.
uh, I'm sorry. You're, uh, you're gonna have to leave. The princess is getting sick.
of course she is. I'll bring her fiance right away.
I forgive you. Are you happy? - No. I'm worried.
are you bulimic again? - no!
I was just sick of listening to your inane questions.
now I need to say a prayer for tolerance and get out there.
eating disorders can return when people are stressed.
clearly, chuck is not the only one freaking out here.
the only thing freaking me out is that louis' sister might notice I'm gone and get suspicious.
why would you worry about her being suspicious if you weren't bulimic?
Blair, this isn't a joke. We are not leaving this room until you agree to get help.
I don't need help. I'm not bulimic. I'm pregnant.
while one mother's life leads her to heaven, another's is going straight to hell in a moses basket.
Beatrice? You have to understand.
it's still so early.
I didn't wanna get louis' hopes up if things weren't okay. I was gonna tell him.
what were you going to tell me?
about her wonderful idea, louis.
I have so many.
you know, the one about inviting the homeless into our meal.
to dine with us? - You're too modest.
I was telling blair about our missionary work, and she suggested we share our meal with those less fortunate.
I think it's wonderful.
of course.
Yes, not to have them eat with us but to serve them the food, like in a soup kitchen, with gloves on.
it's a wonderful idea.
spotted... Chuck on the wrong side of town.
looks like bassman doesn't have enough of a dark side.
he has to take a walk on one, too.
I should go.
you promise you won't say anything?
Yes, but you can't hide this forever.
I think you were right about her, louis.
she'll make a perfect princess.
and... You the perfect sister-in-law.
you know, I swear, I just took that checkbook in case of an emergency.
I didn't wanna use it.
well, why not? It belongs to you. - It does?
Yeah, your mom can't cut you off just because you leave florida.
that's not fair. I was actually gonna call her, but I was waiting till you got back.
I don't wanna involve her.
I'm the one who told her I wanted to make it on my own.
besides, if she knows where I am, then she's just gonna try to make me come back.
that's true. But you can't live... Here.
you have to come live with me.
I'd love to, but I can't afford it.
you can once grandma calls the bank and makes it impossible for your mom to cut you off again.
I don't think that that's such a good idea.
I don't wanna make her any more mad.
well, she'll never find out.
look, I explained to cece how bad being around your mom is for you, and she doesn't wanna deal with carol's wrath either, so she won't tell.
I don't know what to say. I can't believe that you would do this for me.
you can show your gratitude by packing.
I have to go meet my boss, but I'll come pick you up after.
we rhodes girls need to stick together.
get him up!
again? Guys, come on. You can't...
Hey! I'm not part of his payment plan.
sorry. Mr. Bass said nothing should stop us except his safe word.
this is serious. He could die.
though this be madness, yet there is some method in't.
guess that wasn't the safe word.
Chuck. Chuck, tell 'em to stop.
okay. Fine. Stop. - Let's go.
stop? Really? That's it? - I wasn't trying to kill myself.
then what the hell were you doing?
I was hoping it would hurt.
what, to... To dull the pain of losing blair? - That's what you don't understand.
I feel nothing when I see her and louis or when I jump off a building or when I crash a motorcycle. Even you don't irritate me.
well, having these guys beat you up is not the way to try to feel something.
you... You could have died.
is being dead that much worse than being nothing?
I still don't know how you got your mother to agree after she slammed the door in my face.
I just told her it was her chance to tell her side of the story and move on with her life.
and that it made her seem classier than ruth madoff.
clever. That's all it took?
well, I had to let her decide on my internship... Goldman or schumer.
why do either?
well, like I said in l. a,I need to figure out my future, and, you know, both are great options other people would kill for.
how about working for me instead?
I'm not a journalist. - I'm not looking for you to be one.
the newspaper is just the cornerstone of what I hope is gonna be a new media empire.
someone with your persuasive skills could be great at sales or marketing.
once you know how to control information, you can do anything with it...
politics, banking, whatever.
while that sounds great,
I would have to get my family to approve me pulling out of this other thing.
well, just remind them what "george" did for j. f.k. Jr.
see you at the office next week.
watch out, nate.
looks like sex play may not be the only game you're a pawn in.
so it looks like something called a conversion disorder.
people become blind, paralyzed, or unable to feel after experiencing a psychological trauma, i. E. Blair leaving you forever. It's a little like p. t.s. d.
if you say so. - You should see someone.
treatment involves trying to make the patient feel again.
that's what I was doing before you showed up.
well, how about instead of pain, you try to feel good things?
I could tickle you.
I'd rather hire someone else to do that, thank you, but it wouldn't work either.
why don't we discuss why you needed my help before instead?
I wrote a novel. It was something I was working on for a while.
no one was supposed to see it, but then vanessa found it and sent it to a publisher, so I need to find out which one so I can, uh, I can stop it from coming out.
forgive me for stating the obvious, but isn't being published a writer's goal?
not for this book. It's... It's a scathing social satire about everyone I know, including you.
return of charlie trout.
I need to get into vanessa's bank account so I can see who's making the deposits before anyone sees what I wrote.
well, just because I can't feel anything shouldn't mean everyone else has to endure a humiliation.
I'll help you.
so jason said we could crash with him and his roommates until we find our own place.
Max... - What's going on?
I don't think I can go. - What are you talking about? It'll be great.
I even got us onion-flavored snacks for the road.
and these things.
what changed?
remember what you said. This isn't giving up on our dreams.
it's just making them happen in a different place.
I'm sorry.
I just realized that what's making me unhappy in l. a. Isn't l. a.
it's you.
where is this coming from? I love you.
I'm sorry. I wish I could explain better, but I can't.
just... Be happy and...
know that I never meant to hurt you.
how well do any of us really know each other? even families have their secrets.
we were so close. I could even see my mother's face as louis gave away his title because his fiancee was bulimic.
she would have never forgiven him.
it would have been perfect.
why not just tell her blair's pregnant?
please. Nothing would make her happier than a grandchild by golden boy.
I just have to find another way to get louis out of monaco for good so my mother will finally see i was the right choice all along.
vengeance becomes you.
so how did your crazy roommate take it?
it wasn't easy, but he'll be fine.
well, maybe you should get further from him than just santa monica.
I'm sure it's okay. Unless you found us a different apartment.
mm, how about one on the upper east side?
what are you talking about?
well, turns out my boss was only in l. a. For the movie.
so my meeting was about transferring her back to her new york office, and I want you to come with me.
last time didn't work out so well.
well, this time, you won't have your mom to worry about, and you'll have your trust fund and your family.
Cece wants us to stay with her in montecito until we leave, and her house is huge.
you would love it. Please. All you have to do is say yes.
why not? I think I'm done here.
they say blood is thicker than water.
but it's also a lot harder to clean up when it spills.
if I'd known any better, i'd think you're starting to like brooklyn.
it isn't brooklyn i'm here for.
you're the only person I can have a furtive, emotionally loaded conversation with right now.
how's chuck? - Uh, he's... Okay.
sort of. Long freudian story. How are you?
pregnant.
that makes it sound more real.
I had hoped denial would last longer as a coping mechanism, but breast tenderness and morning sickness made that impossible.
you know, you do have options.
and I've considered them all, but no matter what, this baby was conceived out of love, and... I'm gonna keep it.
have you not told louis because it might be chuck's?
I only slept with him once. I slept with louis a hundred times.
he may be mild-mannered, but he's surprisingly virile.
so by the sheer law of probability, it must be his.
well, except the definition of "probability is "strong likelihood" not, uh,"known fact.
haven't you read "the power of positive thinking"?
put your giant intellect aside and just focus with me on wish fulfillment.
this is not that kind of situation. Even blair waldorf cannot bend d. n.a. To her will.
I am about to marry a fabulous man...
who happens to be a prince.
I can't be this close to having all my dreams come true only to have them yanked away by one transgression at a stranger's bar mitzvah.
look, I know it's scary, but I think you should know who the father is, if not for yourself, then for the baby.
and what if I lose everything?
you'll still have me.
maybe it's not blood bonds that make us a family.
perhaps it's the people who know our secrets and love us anyway, so we can finally be ourselves.
gossip girl here...
your one and only source into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
how about a tour? - Absolutely.
it is my house. Don't you think you should be the one to go?
actually, this is my house. Nice to meet you, by the way, um...
Nate. - How would you like to keep working for me?
I would love to.
I have to say it was a pretty devious plan.
thank you, Ivy. You played your part perfectly.
one month anniversary of our move.
Ivy, stop talking to your boyfriend and start working.
Charlie! Oh, my gosh! - What are you doing here?
why would Vanessa steal your story? - To teach me a lesson.
people write songs about wiping out on our l. a. Roadways.
I'm not scared of anything.
do they know? - Know what?
how far along you are. I'd say... Six weeks?
I'm not pregnant. - Lie to me all you want, but your body will be telling the whole world the truth by the time of your wedding.
rise and shine, upper east siders.
it's time for your annual checkup.
lucky for you, doctors take their confidentiality seriously around here.
are you sure this doctor's reputable?
your prenatal care is imperative.
you never care about my womb before.
maybe this is way to avoid seeing Mr. Louis off on trip to Monaco for feast of assumption holiday.
Louis' sister Beatrice is picking him up at noon in their jet, which gives us plenty of time to discuss your gestational issues.
Dorota, how are you feeling? - She's fine.
I'm blair, dorota's employer. I have a few questions.
just go with it. Is only way.
I need to ask you how long her morning sickness will last.
as I'm naturally empathetic, the mere discussion of food...
not to mention the odor, the taste...
it should ease off in the first trimester.
and... What about breast sensitivity?
miss Blair! - Is the one asking the questions.
you see, she practically screams when anyone touches them.
I can hear her all the way from queens.
Sensitivity's totally normal.
okay. And, um, how long till she can determine the father of her child?
she's had a few one-night stands with the staff of our building.
Blair cornelia waldorf! - You two should work this out.
Dorota can come back another time... Alone.
I'm sorry.
I - I don't know what's come over me.
Yes, you do.
you are pregnant, too. We are like sisters now!
cousins. Distant cousins.
miss blair, why you not say you are...
do not utter the word. No one must know.
well, at least not until I have some time to figure things out.
I don't care what you say. I hug you anyway for luck and keep secret.
I'm sorry. It's not you... - I'm so sick of all you guys on antidepressants.
it's a good thing you don't offer satisfaction guaranteed, or she'd be your third refund this week.
do you need pharmaceutical assistance? - Yeah, I wish weed was the answer.
I meant viagra. - no, Everything works down there.
it's here that's the problem. I just can't stop thinking about that woman from l. a.
it's understandable, given your mother issues. She called twice.
she did? Did she leave a number or at least her name?
last I heard, it was Anne Archibald.
Yeah, well, in an attempt to take some of your advice about my future,
I asked my mom if she could help me get an internship this fall.
schumer and lloyd blankfein at goldman are both interested, and now she wants me to choose.
so call your mommy. Pick either job.
forget about your mysterious lady from l. a.
if a woman wants to see you again, she generally tells you her name.
what happened to the son helping the father make breakfast?
you've been on that computer since you got here.
I know. Sorry. I'm... I'm trying to figure out which publisher has my book so I can stop it from coming out.
and jeremiah harris wasn't any help?
no, no, the only clue I have is this, uh, check vanessa sent me.
I'm sorry. I'll be one more minute, and then I will be in there to burn the bacon, I swear.
um, listen, I know you're probably on your way to surf or hanging out at cameron diaz's house, but, uh,
I was wondering if you could share some of your bank breaking secrets with me.
well, I thought you did all your scheming with blair.
no, she's not speaking to me.
I just need, um, to help vanessa with a bounced check, and I can't reach her.
I was thinking that, you know, whatever you did to get into lily's safe deposit box might also work for me.
Oh, well, that was all chuck.
he slept with the girl at the bank.
but knowing him, there are many more girls at many more banks.
you should ask him.
right. Chuck. Okay, thanks.
so are you really staying out there?
well, I got a great job, and charlie's here.
Char-charlie as in "call me serena" cousin charlie who moved back to florida?
Yeah, who's actually been living in l. a. One and the same.
I'm about to go to brunch with her and make her fill in all the blanks.
well, don't be too quick to option her life rights before you make sure she's back on her meds.
but in all seriousness, tell her I said hi.
Bye.
and for my final course, a hot peach clafouti, inspired by my hot girlfriend ivy.
Oh, three michelin star, definitely.
which... Of these scream "i am a new york city trust fund baby" more?
those, I guess.
you okay? You seem extra nervous about this audition?
Yeah.
some days it's just not as much fun trying to be an actress.
well, at least we're failing together.
unlike jason... He just got this huge chef gig at beast in portland.
Hey, it's cheap, too. Moving there could end my days of plating salad with dressing on the side and save you from using your mysterious emergency fund.
Max, I told you, this is my last resort. There's only enough to use it once.
I know. It's just, I don't want to end up like everybody else who comes to l. a. With dreams only to find that l. a.is the place where dreams come to die.
or you get those weird lips that everybody here has.
let's not give up yet.
I promise things will get better.
I wish you could join me for the feast.
the church celebrates with all of monaco's favorite foods to honor virgin mother honest rise to heaven.
why aren't you waiting to greet princess beatrice at the elevator?
I know you two will love each other.
don't be so sure.
my first impression on grimaldi women thus far has been abysmal at best.
unlike grimaldi men who fall in love the moment they see you, but don't worry.
my mother and beatrice never agree on anything.
they make the brothers of brunel look civil.
at least we don't have harems. - Ah, la voila.
Louis... - Me, too.
Beatrice, this is blair.
you are even more beautiful than the photographs in the paper.
the perfume...
it's jasmine and clove oil from africa. Do you like it?
it's powerful.
then I shall give you mine. I'll get more when I go back.
I've always longed for a sister.
sit, sit. Tell me everything.
okay, spill. What are you doing in l. a.
and how did you get your mom to agree to let you come here?
she didn't.
I call her and I tell her that I'm okay, but not where I am.
trust me, it's better this way.
florida was making me crazier than new york ever did.
and you're being responsible with your medication?
I needed a break from my mom, not reality.
well, florida's loss is my gain.
okay, I wanna know everything! Friends, boyfriends.
neither, honestly, which is why it's so sad that you have to go back to new york for school.
well, then I must be a genie,'cause your wish is granted.
I'm staying.
I thought that your movie ended.
Oh, it did, but the producer offered me a job, so I'm meeting with her later today to discuss the details.
but don't worry. We'll have plenty of time to catch up before then.
they say misery loves company, but sometimes it's the company that makes you miserable.
my. Look at the time.
I'm so disappointed that I can't spend all day with you before you rush off to your principality.
you know, blair, I feel just the same, which is why I moved our flight to this evening.
we now have all afternoon to share our secrets like real sisters, and I want to know them all.
I can't wait.
now if you'll excuse me.
but nothing's worse than company that overstays their welcome.
good luck, b. Have fun being the hostess with the mostess.
I get working for this producer's a huge opportunity, but what about columbia?
well, I'm taking the semester off, and I'll see how things go after that.
my only issue is living with cece.
last night, at 2: 00 a. m.her bridge game turned brutal.
a neighbor even came and complained.
well, I'm sure your real estate agent will find you a great place.
well, hopefully near you.
in fact, why don't I have her just meet us at your place?
it's a bad idea. My roommate barely lets me in most days.
and he's kind of howard hughes-ish.
Hey, I was just about to call you.
I'm gonna need to see 2-bedroom apartments instead of one.
okay, great. Thank you. - No, my place is fine.
no, it's not negotiable. This is l. a.
Rhodes girls have to live together. It's tradition.
come on. Let's go.
Hey, chuck. - Ignore him. He's not with me.
Oh, hey, hey, do I need to call the cops?
this isn't what we signed up for. We're outta here.
just... I expect a full refund.
what are you doing? You okay? - I was until you arrived.
uh, you don't... You don't look all right there.
no, no, I have the address. I just need her name, okay?
th-then why are you called "information," huh?
I'm not serena, humphrey. I didn't need saving.
I thought you were still in the hamptons.
I'd ask you how your summer's going, but seeing you with chuck, I guess the answer is probably "weird.
Oh, it gets weirder. I found him paying some really rough dudes to... To fight him.
he wasn't forthcoming with the details, but I...
I would imagine it's some new bass-type scheme to get blair's attention.
well, he said he was okay about her all summer.
or maybe it's finally hitting him now that we're back.
I think something else might have hit him, too.
he was already pretty bruised when I got there. I think he might need to see a doctor.
yeah? Well, my mom has this concierge doc she could send, but calling her means i'd have to decide which internship I want.
well, I could stick around and talk it through with you.
I was also kinda hoping to get some help from chuck on something anyway.
Hey, I'm gonna call a doctor, have him check out your bruises, okay?
excellent.
listen, I'll just, uh, call you when the doctor leaves. How about that?
all right.
well, what do you say to a little shopping for all your pre-wedding events?
Yes. I was thinking wu for my welcome parade... Short but regal.
and alaia would put charlene and her swimmer's body to shame at albert's ball.
those will never do.
Why? They only use children to sew the beading.
you cannot have bare shoulders, exposed knees, anything form-fitting.
too much skin borders on bruni.
I- I-I don't understand. How am I to become an icon of style and taste if I can only wear a burka?
I'm sorry. The dress code is mandated.
so you get balmain, and I get to be barbara bush.
how is this possible?
it's one of the many perks of being the non-reigning sibling.
I'm surprised to hear you say that.
I read the interview you did for "the guardian" when louis gave up his seat for me, and you seemed more than eager to step into that role.
I admit I've always wished for my mother to realize she had two capable children.
but those few days with the world watching my every move were too much.
you, however, are much better suited for the pressures of royal service than i.
shall we have a snack?
actually, I need to find a restroom.
I'm not sure there's enough closet space.
you're kidding, right?
I didn't think it was possible for anyone to need more closets than I do.
I mean, you have a whole room for your shoes alone.
Yeah. But, you know, the... The beach traffic can get really bad, and that might depress me even more than my crazy roommate, so...
maybe I should... Just stay where I am.
so you're gonna give this place up because of traffic?
where in l. a. Is carmeggedon not an issue?
I already have other interest. If you want it, you're gonna need to move quickly.
Oh, I can give you a down payment right now.
except I forgot my checkbook.
but you have yours. I - I saw it when your purse fell.
Yeah. But, you know, I don't think I have enough to cover two months' rent.
unless you bought the maldives without telling me, you should have plenty.
or is this your way of telling me that you don't wanna live with me?
of course not.
all I have is an out-of-state check.
no problem. Just put your local contact information in the memo.
see? I told you this would work out.
you understand fractured ribs aren't something to mess around with.
you could end up puncturing a lung.
I told you, they don't hurt.
I have a hard time believing anyone has that high a threshold for pain.
Yeah, well, he's probably just self-medicating.
you should see his medicine cabinet. Some of that stuff's not even legal in mexico.
no, I was just... I was just kidding.
he claimed he couldn't feel my touching his ribs during the exam.
if he's taking that many drugs, someone needs to keep an eye on him to make sure he doesn't take any more or do anything other than rest.
his injuries are bordering on dangerous.
I'll take care of it. Thank you.
I wish we'd stopped at saint honore.
doesn't shopping leave you famished?
well, perhaps buying one lipstick doesn't build up the same appetite.
lucky you can eat at your feast.
I'm sorry. Too much coffee. Give the virgin my regards.
I'll show you to door.
and by door, I mean elevator.
over there. - I think it's fairly obvious.
our future princess has developed a drug problem.
what? No.
uh, miss blair too much control freak to use mind alter substance, even to help mood swing.
I admire your loyalty, but no one uses les toilettes so often unless they have something to hide.
Louis deserves to know what it is.
I swear, miss blair just... Have sensitive stomach.
of course.
I knew I recognized that faint acrid smell from boarding school.
the pale skin. Not eating in public.
blair's obviously bulimic.
Yes. No. I... I mean, not... Not anymore.
only teenage habit of using restroom die hard.
but miss blair digest everything now.
I go make... Tuna melts for both of you.
Louis? We need to speak right away.
what are you doing in new york, at my house?
leaving, by the look of it.
whoa, were you trying to find me? Oh, this is fantastic.
I haven't been able to stop thinking about you either.
can't believe you actually tracked me down.
Oh, that is borderline adorable, but I wasn't here to see you.
as of recently, I own "the new york spectator,
and I wanted to interview your mother for my inaugural article on the disgraced wives of dirty businessmen, but she not-so-politely declined.
okay, wait, even if this is a coincidence, it's a pretty damn good one.
all right? I was here just to discuss job offers with my mom, but I would much rather take you out.
Oh, we had fun, nate, but I need more than just stamina to keep me interested.
nice seeing ya.
whoa, whoa, wait. Will you at least tell me your name?
what's so important it couldn't wait until our 7-hour flight tonight?
your fiancee is bulimic. - Is that all?
bulimia is a serious disease.
Blair told me all about her teenage struggles. It's in her past.
past hour. She's not well, louis.
or she needs an escape from a shopping trip full of rules. She told me about that, too.
I was just trying to prepare her for the pressures of your life.
the stress will be the worst thing for her condition, all so you can claim a title we both know you don't even care about.
you know I'll do whatever I have to to ensure blair's well-being.
but believe me, she's doing great. There's nothing to worry about.
you never did understand la psychologie des femmes.
I guess I will just have to prove it to you.
go ahead. I will prove you wrong.
Hi. Yes. This is charlie rhodes from earlier.
turns out that serena and I have changed our minds about the apartment, so if it's okay with you, i'd like to come back and get my check.
miss rhodes, your check was invalid. The bank told me it was no good.
I'm sorry? I gave it back to miss van der woodsen when she brought me a new one.
maybe you should speak to her about this.
saltines only thing I eat for months with ana.
well, that was not the same.
your people are bred to work through these conditions and give birth in a field.
no fields in krakow.
and I have birthing suite at lenox hill.
well, I am too exhausted to even reprimand your insubordination.
at least she and prince louis gone. You have time to figure out...
don't even let the word leave your lips.
you never know who could be lurking.
Louis. Darling.
Ah, I was just about to take a nap because I was so exhausted from that shopping trip.
so romantic of you to come and say a final good-bye.
Beatrice didn't want you to miss your first monegasque holiday.
and that is so kind.
I'm sure the virgin will understand that I'm too busy to be away.
which is why I had our priest arrange to celebrate here in new york.
he's already spoken to the local church.
I hope you're hungry. It's called the feast for a very good reason.
let's hope b's first feast of assumption doesn't end in damnation.
back again? What don't you get? Unlike serena, when I rejected you, I meant it.
Nate asked me to keep an eye on you while he was out.
and while I'm here, I was wondering if you could help me with something.
the answer is no.
and what did you do when the doctor said you're not supposed to go out?
well, if you're willing to fight me over it, we could strike a deal.
well, that kinda defeats the purpose of making sure you don't get hurt.
there isn't a chance in hell you could hurt me.
Chuck, I know you saw the blast about blair and louis going to the event tonight.
it's not worth puncturing a lung to get her attention.
blair's attention is the last thing on my mind.
come on, man. You do something dangerous.
gossip girl" reports it. Blair comes to your rescue. Some might call that a pattern.
Humphrey, you know nothing about our situation.
well, I do know that blair is over you.
you weren't even the last one to kiss her before louis. I was.
while her lips may have brushed yours, the last person she was with before she left was me.
I'm referring to full carnal knowledge.
a kiss is just a kiss.
that hurt? Wish I could feel it.
poor lonely boy, excuse me, ma'am, I think you were fired from this establishment.
I want to go to portland.
if this is about your audition, you can't let one bad experience make you give up on your dreams.
my dreams will never come true if we stay here, but yours could if we leave.
I thought about it, and you were right.
let's go before we're forced to leave.
okay, if you're sure. I'll tell the manager when she gets back from break.
Hey, this is gonna be good. I can feel it.
we'll be like bonnie and clyde.
without the killing and robbing and car chases.
I'm gonna go home and pack. - Okay.
I must have gained 10 pounds last year. It's so delicious.
Louis. - Mon pere.
I am sorry we missed you at cap d'antibes this summer.
well, your missionary work is more important.
Blair, this is father cavalia, the man who will marry us.
Bonjour. - How wonderful.
well, I'm so sorry you can't be in your own church on this devout day.
perhaps if you got on the plane right now, you could make it?
don't be silly. This way, I have a chance to get to know you away from all my duties.
did you enjoy a religious upbringing, miss waldorf?
my family's of mixed faith, but I've always appreciated a confessional.
in fact, I'm gonna go find one right now.
as you know, the confessionnelle is not available during a celebration.
genial. Have you ever tried a barbagiuan?
Mmm, my favorite.
it's filled with pumpkin and spices and butter.
it's delicious.
I can't help it. I love those.
je vous salue, marie.
surely the virgin mother can show mercy to those on earth still suffering while she rises to heaven.
I - if you'll excuse me, I see a lost soul in need of guidance.
thank you. I will never question the paternity of your child again.
I told you. She can't even keep down one bite of barbagiuan.
you're starting to sound like mother.
but unlike her, who doesn't care about anyone but herself, i'm trying to save your fiancee. Why aren't you?
Blair, hey, listen, I know you don't wanna see me right now, probably not ever, but I'm not here to cause problems.
I can't say the same about chuck. Have you seen him?
walk with me.
well, thanks for coming back, diana payne.
Ah, you found the card I left for your mother.
please tell me it was her who texted me to come back here and not you.
Oh, she's right inside. - So why are we out here?
her text said she'd relented and agreed to talk to me for my "spectator" article.
she did. There are just a few final details that need to be worked out first.
I know. She has a concern that I'm turning the "spectato" into a tabloid, but I'm very happy to give her story approval.
wait, wait, wait. What about me? I mean, I am the one who convinced her, after all.
I mean, don't you think there should be some sort of, you know, finder's fee?
are you trying to trade my interview with your mother for sex?
well, I would've called it a date, but yeah, basically.
how do I know your mother's really inside?
well, you can watch me open the door and tell her that we'll be back in an hour.
what makes you think we need that long?
stamina.
Serena. What are you doing here?
I got your address off the check that the realtor gave me.
I'm sorry. I... Was a flake and forgot to look at my balance.
okay, but you can just stop. I know what really happened.
out. The princess needs privacy.
my security detail will escort any of you who are not willing to go out on your own.
security detail?
what's going on? Blair, I thought you were mad at me.
and you have my forgiveness if you shut up and guard the door.
it's not like you to forgive me or run away from a feast.
might this have something to do with you sleeping with chuck?
how in the world did you know that?
forget it. I don't even have time to care.
what don't you understand about "guard the door"?
I can't believe that I thought you changed last year, and since you didn't, chuck is now going off the deep end trying to get your attention again.
no, now that's where you're wrong. Whatever he's doing isn't about me.
he was the one who told me to marry louis, and he meant it.
now you're gonna be sorry you didn't guard.
are you... Are you gonna go with me in here?
I'm not sure our friendship can handle that.
"friendship" is a tenuous term. Now be a gentleman and... Run the water.
uh, I'm sorry. You're, uh, you're gonna have to leave. The princess is getting sick.
of course she is. I'll bring her fiance right away.
I forgive you. Are you happy? - No. I'm worried.
are you bulimic again? - no!
I was just sick of listening to your inane questions.
now I need to say a prayer for tolerance and get out there.
eating disorders can return when people are stressed.
clearly, chuck is not the only one freaking out here.
the only thing freaking me out is that louis' sister might notice I'm gone and get suspicious.
why would you worry about her being suspicious if you weren't bulimic?
Blair, this isn't a joke. We are not leaving this room until you agree to get help.
I don't need help. I'm not bulimic. I'm pregnant.
while one mother's life leads her to heaven, another's is going straight to hell in a moses basket.
Beatrice? You have to understand.
it's still so early.
I didn't wanna get louis' hopes up if things weren't okay. I was gonna tell him.
what were you going to tell me?
about her wonderful idea, louis.
I have so many.
you know, the one about inviting the homeless into our meal.
to dine with us? - You're too modest.
I was telling blair about our missionary work, and she suggested we share our meal with those less fortunate.
I think it's wonderful.
of course.
Yes, not to have them eat with us but to serve them the food, like in a soup kitchen, with gloves on.
it's a wonderful idea.
spotted... Chuck on the wrong side of town.
looks like bassman doesn't have enough of a dark side.
he has to take a walk on one, too.
I should go.
you promise you won't say anything?
Yes, but you can't hide this forever.
I think you were right about her, louis.
she'll make a perfect princess.
and... You the perfect sister-in-law.
you know, I swear, I just took that checkbook in case of an emergency.
I didn't wanna use it.
well, why not? It belongs to you. - It does?
Yeah, your mom can't cut you off just because you leave florida.
that's not fair. I was actually gonna call her, but I was waiting till you got back.
I don't wanna involve her.
I'm the one who told her I wanted to make it on my own.
besides, if she knows where I am, then she's just gonna try to make me come back.
that's true. But you can't live... Here.
you have to come live with me.
I'd love to, but I can't afford it.
you can once grandma calls the bank and makes it impossible for your mom to cut you off again.
I don't think that that's such a good idea.
I don't wanna make her any more mad.
well, she'll never find out.
look, I explained to cece how bad being around your mom is for you, and she doesn't wanna deal with carol's wrath either, so she won't tell.
I don't know what to say. I can't believe that you would do this for me.
you can show your gratitude by packing.
I have to go meet my boss, but I'll come pick you up after.
we rhodes girls need to stick together.
get him up!
again? Guys, come on. You can't...
Hey! I'm not part of his payment plan.
sorry. Mr. Bass said nothing should stop us except his safe word.
this is serious. He could die.
though this be madness, yet there is some method in't.
guess that wasn't the safe word.
Chuck. Chuck, tell 'em to stop.
okay. Fine. Stop. - Let's go.
stop? Really? That's it? - I wasn't trying to kill myself.
then what the hell were you doing?
I was hoping it would hurt.
what, to... To dull the pain of losing blair? - That's what you don't understand.
I feel nothing when I see her and louis or when I jump off a building or when I crash a motorcycle. Even you don't irritate me.
well, having these guys beat you up is not the way to try to feel something.
you... You could have died.
is being dead that much worse than being nothing?
I still don't know how you got your mother to agree after she slammed the door in my face.
I just told her it was her chance to tell her side of the story and move on with her life.
and that it made her seem classier than ruth madoff.
clever. That's all it took?
well, I had to let her decide on my internship... Goldman or schumer.
why do either?
well, like I said in l. a,I need to figure out my future, and, you know, both are great options other people would kill for.
how about working for me instead?
I'm not a journalist. - I'm not looking for you to be one.
the newspaper is just the cornerstone of what I hope is gonna be a new media empire.
someone with your persuasive skills could be great at sales or marketing.
once you know how to control information, you can do anything with it...
politics, banking, whatever.
while that sounds great,
I would have to get my family to approve me pulling out of this other thing.
well, just remind them what "george" did for j. f.k. Jr.
see you at the office next week.
watch out, nate.
looks like sex play may not be the only game you're a pawn in.
so it looks like something called a conversion disorder.
people become blind, paralyzed, or unable to feel after experiencing a psychological trauma, i. E. Blair leaving you forever. It's a little like p. t.s. d.
if you say so. - You should see someone.
treatment involves trying to make the patient feel again.
that's what I was doing before you showed up.
well, how about instead of pain, you try to feel good things?
I could tickle you.
I'd rather hire someone else to do that, thank you, but it wouldn't work either.
why don't we discuss why you needed my help before instead?
I wrote a novel. It was something I was working on for a while.
no one was supposed to see it, but then vanessa found it and sent it to a publisher, so I need to find out which one so I can, uh, I can stop it from coming out.
forgive me for stating the obvious, but isn't being published a writer's goal?
not for this book. It's... It's a scathing social satire about everyone I know, including you.
return of charlie trout.
I need to get into vanessa's bank account so I can see who's making the deposits before anyone sees what I wrote.
well, just because I can't feel anything shouldn't mean everyone else has to endure a humiliation.
I'll help you.
so jason said we could crash with him and his roommates until we find our own place.
Max... - What's going on?
I don't think I can go. - What are you talking about? It'll be great.
I even got us onion-flavored snacks for the road.
and these things.
what changed?
remember what you said. This isn't giving up on our dreams.
it's just making them happen in a different place.
I'm sorry.
I just realized that what's making me unhappy in l. a. Isn't l. a.
it's you.
where is this coming from? I love you.
I'm sorry. I wish I could explain better, but I can't.
just... Be happy and...
know that I never meant to hurt you.
how well do any of us really know each other? even families have their secrets.
we were so close. I could even see my mother's face as louis gave away his title because his fiancee was bulimic.
she would have never forgiven him.
it would have been perfect.
why not just tell her blair's pregnant?
please. Nothing would make her happier than a grandchild by golden boy.
I just have to find another way to get louis out of monaco for good so my mother will finally see i was the right choice all along.
vengeance becomes you.
so how did your crazy roommate take it?
it wasn't easy, but he'll be fine.
well, maybe you should get further from him than just santa monica.
I'm sure it's okay. Unless you found us a different apartment.
mm, how about one on the upper east side?
what are you talking about?
well, turns out my boss was only in l. a. For the movie.
so my meeting was about transferring her back to her new york office, and I want you to come with me.
last time didn't work out so well.
well, this time, you won't have your mom to worry about, and you'll have your trust fund and your family.
Cece wants us to stay with her in montecito until we leave, and her house is huge.
you would love it. Please. All you have to do is say yes.
why not? I think I'm done here.
they say blood is thicker than water.
but it's also a lot harder to clean up when it spills.
if I'd known any better, i'd think you're starting to like brooklyn.
it isn't brooklyn i'm here for.
you're the only person I can have a furtive, emotionally loaded conversation with right now.
how's chuck? - Uh, he's... Okay.
sort of. Long freudian story. How are you?
pregnant.
that makes it sound more real.
I had hoped denial would last longer as a coping mechanism, but breast tenderness and morning sickness made that impossible.
you know, you do have options.
and I've considered them all, but no matter what, this baby was conceived out of love, and... I'm gonna keep it.
have you not told louis because it might be chuck's?
I only slept with him once. I slept with louis a hundred times.
he may be mild-mannered, but he's surprisingly virile.
so by the sheer law of probability, it must be his.
well, except the definition of "probability is "strong likelihood" not, uh,"known fact.
haven't you read "the power of positive thinking"?
put your giant intellect aside and just focus with me on wish fulfillment.
this is not that kind of situation. Even blair waldorf cannot bend d. n.a. To her will.
I am about to marry a fabulous man...
who happens to be a prince.
I can't be this close to having all my dreams come true only to have them yanked away by one transgression at a stranger's bar mitzvah.
look, I know it's scary, but I think you should know who the father is, if not for yourself, then for the baby.
and what if I lose everything?
you'll still have me.
maybe it's not blood bonds that make us a family.
perhaps it's the people who know our secrets and love us anyway, so we can finally be ourselves.
your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
Ivy, stop talking to your boyfriend and start working.
Charlie! - Oh, my gosh! What are you doing here?
"the beautiful and the damned" wraps in a week, - But how would you like to keep working for me? - I would love to.
what are you looking for over there? - My phone.
I think I left it at the fashion show when the assistant checked it in.
I'm not interested in interviews with New York's elite.
I want their secrets and scandals.
you had everyone's phones taken. Why didn't you just, you know, look at some of them?
do you know someone called Ivy?
I never intended to publish "Inside."
somehow it fell into Simon & Schuster's laps.
it's a satire of my entire life and everyone I know.
you didn't write this book. I did.
Bravo! He did it!
I told you I'd get him to step forward.
Dan Humphrey, Alessandra Steele, my agent.
loved the book.
do I know you? Any of you? Do I know anyone here at all?
the ending... Just slays me.
slays me how you're all alone with no friends left...
surrounded by people who think they know you but really don't.
it's genius.
right, but, uh, it's not me. It's the character Dylan Hunter.
the book, is, uh, the book is fiction.
well, I'm happy to tell you it's a brilliant piece of fiction that's number 38 on the Amazon preorder list.
25, 000 shipped so far.
quick question. How big can my head get before it explodes?
half the buys are probably upper east siders dying to see if they're in it.
Yeah. Some of my friends might feel they are.
they're coming tonight, right?
to... To the book party? No.
I... Haven't exactly mentioned it to them yet.
um, I'd have to tell them the book exists first.
they don't know? Not any of them?
no. And I'm not sure they're gonna like it when they find out.
and they should be at the soiree tonight when everybody learns that "anonymous" is actually Daniel Humphrey.
I'm gonna need six copies of this book, uh, that should probably be hand-delivered.
I'll see you later at Giorgio Armani for your suit fitting?
and don't shave.
makes you look like a real writer.
I now understand why women used to go into confinement.
it wasn't because of modesty but vanity.
look at my boobs. Oh, I'm huge.
are you even listening? - Sorry, darling.
I was just reading about how some pregnant women have mood swings.
apparently, they didn't know you before the pregnancy.
Oh, you look gorgeous.
I - I can't wait to tell the whole world the good news.
me, too.
my mother and Beatrice arrive tonight.
and I asked my mom and Cyrus to join us for dinner at the consulate.
and then we'll tell everyone together.
you don't think your family is gonna be upset, do you?
I don't want them to think of me as the star of some trashy MTV show like "Unmarried And Pregnant Princesses" or, I don't know,"Royally Screwed."
my mother will be over the moon.
the job of any princess is to provide an heir to the kingdom.
and that is exactly what you are doing.
an heir to a kingdom lives within me.
how very Shakespeare.
a comedy, not a tragedy, I hope.
so do I, which is why I have to tell one person before we meet up with the families.
and I can do that right now.
Yeah, we received the latest draft. It's on Jane's desk.
okay, I'll have her call you. Thank you.
morning, everyone. I'm on a juice fast this week.
not going to be pretty.
um, I will put those in the fridge for you.
I'll also request an extra cashew drink. It makes the day bearable.
thank you.
list. Yes.
the coverage you wanted on the Krakauer Galley is on your desk, as well as the new spec script that Sony won in the bidding war.
what is it again? - "American Psycho" in prep school.
make it go away.
also, um, I know that it's a long shot, but I sent Daniel Day Lewis "The Blue Rose, " along with a note and a rosebush that only grows in Ireland.
I don't know. I thought it might be a special touch.
Daniel never agrees to do anything. The man took three years to make a pair of shoes.
but I like that you're putting it out there.
Sam? - Yes?
could you get me and Serena two green teas?
Yeah, sure. Happy to.
I knew that my instincts were right hiring you. You're a smart cookie.
you can look at your phone. I don't run a Gulag.
thank you.
that's Piper Van Allen. And that's Sullivan Baker.
and I care about their pg-13 pictures because...
cause Piper is married to Jason Van Allen.
Oh, well, I am slightly more interested.
Yeah, and Sullivan's with that celebrity florist guy.
I think they got married in Amagansett this summer.
that's a twist I wasn't expecting.
well, our phone swipe at the Jenny Packham show gave us some pretty good stories.
Yeah, but pretty good isn't perfect.
if only we had Blair Waldorf's phone.
I told you, she's my friend. My friends are off-limits.
morals. How quaint.
I mean, why do you even hold on to that phone if you're not gonna answer it?
because I don't have to explain how I got it.
but I am too intrigued by our mysterious "Ivy" to just toss it away.
well, we could always lie, say we found it on the street.
how are we gonna find her?
look. There are no names in the phone, only numbers.
and there was no tag for her at the party.
well, maybe she was just a crasher. You know, a nobody.
nobodies don't hide their friends. They advertise them.
I have a feeling about this girl.
wait a second. Hold on. I know that number.
yeah?
all right, well, I'll be back in a bit, hopefully with a new lead.
your call has been forwarded to an automated...
still haven't found your phone?
no, and I've been calling it nonstop.
well, maybe it's time for a new one. New city, new cell phone.
Yeah, but my whole world's in that phone.
final mix of Panic's debut album.
this is so exciting.
Yeah, it's been a long time coming.
do you ever regret not getting back into music sooner, Rufus?
Nah. No, I wouldn't give up raising my kids for anything.
I mean, I love music, but Dan and Jenny... They're my life.
okay, everybody ready?
maybe that's Dan. I was hoping he would join.
good boy.
hello.
do you know what this summoning is about?
I do but I can't say. I'm sworn to secrecy.
since when do you bite your tongue? - I'm learning.
well, isn't Humphrey becoming quite the drama queen?
isn't that usually your role?
I prefer drama princess now.
how are you, by the way?
I'm okay. Thanks for asking.
sorry. Squirrels.
shall we?
what are you guys doing here?
we must have all gotten the same text from Dan.
the last time he was this secretive, he showed up with a baby.
don't worry. You're not about to become a grandfather, though Dan is about to give birth in another way.
okay, I'm pretty sure this is how every murder mystery begins.
Serena, how was your job?
uh, really great, actually.
so great she has no time for me.
well, I would if you weren't asleep every time I got home.
uh, I'm still jet-lagged. - Haven't you been home for weeks?
it certainly feels that way when I'm around you.
Serena, quick question. You don't happen to know a girl named Ivy, do you?
uh, I don't think so. Why?
well, I found her cell, but I don't know how to get it back to her.
your number was in her phone book.
what's her number? I'll dial it.
look! Here's Dan.
Hey, everyone. Thank you so much for coming.
I only have five minutes. - This better be really important.
what is this all about? - Is everything all right?
this isn't about me, right? - Yeah, what's going on, Dan?
this is going to be fun.
I'm sorry to call everyone here on such short notice, but, uh...
all right, you know how there's been all this speculation about the book that's being published by an anonymous author?
Yeah. Gossip girl said it was about us.
Yeah, it was probably written by some loser who doesn't even know us.
well, not exactly.
I am that loser.
I wrote it.
and it is based on...
you... Sort of... All of you.
looks like it's going to be a hot time in this old town tonight.
let's just hope lonely boy and his book don't go up in flames.
what are you doing? I thought you were waiting downstairs.
I'm tired of waiting. When are you gonna tell them?
soon. I promise.
"soon" isn't soon enough.
it's time they all knew about us.
what's so funny?
I think you should ask Dan.
uh, well, I-I might've made your character...
a little... - gay.
I hope that's okay. Stop enjoying this so much.
you wanted me to feel something. That's a feeling.
do I have game?
Oh, definitely.
I'm cool with that.
I - I know it's gonna be a little weird with everyone reading characters inspired by themselves, but I-I wanna make it clear...
this book is a work of fiction.
and after you read it, I hope that you'll feel good enough about it and me that, uh, you will come to this book party tonight.
the publisher is announcing that I'm the author. So...
Yeah. Of course we'll be there.
well, read it first and then decide because I...
you know, I didn't have a lot of time to make changes, and there are some instances where it's not exactly how I would've wanted it.
well, an artist never feels his work is perfect.
but it's good to always strive for more. I am so proud of you, son.
I am gonna cancel my whole day with panic just so I can savor your book.
so... Now that this unnecessary meeting about America's future doorstop is adjourned, do you wanna go grab a cup of decaf?
Oh, I would love to, b. but I'm already late for work. I gotta get back.
well, maybe after work then?
if this is about the book, don't worry. Everyone loves a villain.
I wouldn't say there's a villain, per se.
well, I can tell you who isn't.
come on. Every girl needs to be knocked off her pedestal a little.
can't handle that kind of pressure.
I'll see you later.
um, you know that story I wrote that Louis killed?
it's in the book?
Yeah, I figured. But if it's all the same to you,
I think I'd like to stay in the dark about just how nastily you've portrayed me.
Yeah, that's a good idea. I mean, you know, we're just recently friends again.
why ruin a good thing?
Yeah, and, uh, I'm sorry in advance, but I have a better offer than your party tonight.
Louis and I are telling our families our news.
good luck. - You, too.
your novel seems to be, uh, very well-punctuated, and I liked the font.
Yeah. I'll, uh, I'll be right over. Bye.
a book written about you guys. It sounds exciting.
I hope he wasn't writing it when I went nutso last year.
trust me, there was enough insanity around before you even got here.
so... You and Serena were talking about a girl named Ivy?
I think I met someone at the Jenny Packham show with that name.
can I help?
actually, yeah. I was just hoping to find her and give her phone back.
I think she was with one of Lily's society friends.
maybe we could look through her phone contacts, jog my memory?
I left it at the office, but yeah, I could do that.
do you happen to remember what she looks like?
blonde... Boobs... Botox?
that pretty much describes everyone at the event.
if I saw her, I'd probably recognize her.
What'd I miss?
uh, Nigel Kirstein called for you, and we got an advance copy of this new book by some anonymous New York insider, and everyone in town is trying to figure out who.
well, I know who. I used to date him.
shut up.
no way. You're "Sabrina"?
the dreamy blonde with the legs.
I guess I am.
Hi, uh, this is Serena Van Der Woodsen returning.
Yeah, I'll hold.
did you actually have cases of champagne delivered to your school?
is that what he wrote?
no, a friend was pulling a prank on me.
but it happened? - That was in high school.
keep reading. You'll see I mature as he gets to know me better.
Oh, no, it's great to hear from you, too.
what?
Daniel Day Llewis responded to my letter about "The Blue Rose"?
himself?
Yeah. No, of... Of course. Okay, thank you so much.
what was that? - That was his manager.
they... They wanna set up a conference call to talk about the project.
I have to tell Jane right now.
Dylan Hunter said everything comes easy for you.
keep reading. I told you.
I'm almost through.
so... I was thinking "Pierre" maybe if it's a boy, since it's a Grimaldi family name.
why not "Charles"?
it's a name that seems to have special significance to you.
W - what?
Louis, is something wrong?
I know you were with Chuck.
is that who you needed to tell our news to?
no.
it was Serena, and I didn't even get a chance to.
Dan gathered us all together because he wrote some novel about everyone, and he wanted to make sure we knew about it first.
but the way he said he made you in that story...
if there's an entire book, it could be terrible.
I would expect nothing less.
I was mean to him on the steps of the met.
I bad-mouthed him repeatedly to his dream girl.
I tried to undermine him at "W. " I - I'm sure he's brutal.
look, he may be calling this a novel, but I know just how little imagination he really has.
it's a memoir masquerading as fiction like a reverse James Frey.
so you're going to read it?
no. No. And... And you shouldn't either.
look... That book has nothing to do with us and the family we're building.
whatever's in there, even if it is the truth, it's in the past.
now if you'll excuse me, this baby of yours is making me so tired,
I need to lie down.
still nothing?
the woman I met's not even in the background anywhere.
maybe she's a ghost.
well, at an upper east side event, we just call them first wives.
Nate, can I see you for a minute?
Yeah. Sure.
I'm sorry. You know, I-I can leave.
it's fine. I only need a minute. I'm Diana, by the way.
so I gathered. Charlie.
who is that and why is she in my office?
Charlie Rhodes, all right? Serena's cousin.
and she said she met a woman named Ivy at the fashion show last week.
I don't care who she is. We can't have strangers in here going through our photos.
you should know better.
listen, she's trustworthy, I promise.
I don't care. Get rid of her.
I'm sorry. I... Wasn't any more help.
if I remember anything more about her, I'll let you know.
it was really nice to meet you. I've heard so much.
I'll see you. - Bye.
thanks for letting me hang here, man.
I'm rather enjoying watching you squirm.
scotch? - It's, like 2:00 p. m.
valium then?
I'm guessing my dad is, uh, probably halfway through and Nate's probably still on page 20.
I wonder if they're gonna be upset with me.
alessandra said it isn't that scathing.
and I... And I... I am... I'm harshest on myself.
I hope they can see that. Come here, buddy.
stop whining.
you're not the first person to use the world around them for inspiration.
didn't your dad get temporarily famous singing about Lily?
Yeah, but my book isn't a love song, you know?
why aren't you mad at me? Your character dies...
accidentally, but it's not a... It's not a happy ending.
on the contrary... Although clearly fiction.
I've never use a belt. I'd use a shahtoosh scarf.
much softer.
well... Well, let's hope everyone else shares your point of view.
all success comes at a price.
the artist must stand alone to observe the crowd, right?
it's funny. Vanessa said the same thing.
Hey, dad. W...
Really?
great. You're coming. All right.
uh, you know, I have another call, but... But, uh, but I'll see you tonight. Okay? All right.
Hello?
seems like things are looking up for lonely boy.
thank you. Thank you so much. It means a lot that you're coming.
let's hope they've actually read the book and not judged it by its cover.
how is it I can sleep for two hours and still be so exhausted?
Louis, are you sitting here by yourself?
I was just, uh, waiting for you to wake up so I could tell you the bad news.
my family is not going to make it.
there is a terrible storm over the Atlantic that has delayed their trip.
I, I'll let my mom and Cyrus know.
we can tell them tomorrow when Sophie and Beatrice arrive.
if they make it by then.
well... What do you want to do tonight instead?
shall I make a reservation for Gramercy tavern?
I have some work to catch up on.
why don't you go to Dan's book party?
I'm sure he'd love to see you.
okay.
Louis just lied to me about his family.
how you know?
my outfit for tonight's announcement included a pair of Crocodile Alaia's, and you can't wear such a beautiful shoe if there's even a hint of sprinkle outside.
so of course I checked the weather. Clear from Monaco to Manhattan.
maybe have something to do with lonely boy book.
Louis was reading while you sleep.
he did not look happy.
I told him not to read it, it's not like there's anything in it that he doesn't know about me.
Oh, my god. I'm gonna kill Dan Humphrey.
Oh, god, the r. s.v. p.s are rolling in!
the literary world is saying "yes" to you.
to "anonymous. " Let's hope they're still interested when they find out he's me.
they will be.
that and dying to know who you based the characters on.
we'll want to get a photo of you with all your friends tonight.
that way, people can play the guessing game of who's who.
you know, I don't... I don't know. I'm not sure that they're gonna want to...
to be the lead photo on "New York Social Diary"?
they wouldn't all be coming if they didn't want to support you.
well, not everyone's coming. Blair's not.
Yes, she is. She just r. s.v. p.'d. It's right here.
Blair Waldorf, no plus-one.
Really? 'Cause she told me herself that she...
my ex in Scott Rudin's office called.
apparently, everyone is talking about the book that your friend wrote and your character in it.
Oh, I told him that you're Sabrina. I hope that's not a problem.
no, not at all.
it's nice to play such a big part in Dan's book.
we've always been so close.
he must've been a saint to put with you that long.
remind me never to start a juice fast the day we talk to Daniel Day Lewis.
uh, your pineapple mint's on the desk.
better. Let's seal this deal.
Jane Bettinger's office. - Serena?
Yeah. Hi, Nigel. It's me. I'm putting you on speaker with Jane now.
Daniel's manager.
we're going to need to postpone the meeting. Sorry for the short notice.
uh, hold on a minute. I need to hop on another call.
I wonder if this has anything to do with you being in that book.
D. D.L. Is notoriously anti-anything scene-y.
what are you talking about?
Oh, well, there's this novel going around town with a character based on Serena.
"sabrina" is a totally shallow, self-obsessed party girl.
Yes, uh, I finished it.
aren't you being a little reductive? - And ridiculous.
Daniel lives on a farm in Ireland.
his cow's probably giving birth right now, and everything isn't about Serena.
sorry about that.
I'm afraid right now is not a a good time for Daniel to be looking at this particular project.
wait. I'm... I'm sorry. You're... You're passing?
sorry, Sabrina. Movie business. It's all about timing. Cheers.
did he just say "Sabrina"?
did you spend extra time doing your hair tonight, Nathaniel?
I don't mind that Dan made me gay.
I know. I was actually a little offended he didn't make me gay.
personally, I thought you'd be more annoyed at being conflated with Eric.
you didn't read it, did you?
what do you mean by conflated?
your character is two years younger than everyone else and is best friends with the narrator's little sister Frankie.
in fact, the only thing I think you share is lacrosse and a good political pedigree.
what's my character's name again? - Derek.
what took you so long?
I got your text, and I came right over. What's wrong?
I can't believe you told everyone. It was supposed to be our secret.
you're the one who wanted it kept secret, not me.
I have a life... Future... Plans, and...
you can't just screw this up.
I didn't mean to. - You have to understand.
there is nothing between us... Not then, not now.
nothing. - I don't believe you.
do you believe me now?
can we dare believe?
queen B. And lonely boy doing the deed?
even I have to admit it's a novel idea.
Dan! What are you doing here?
I'm supposed to be here. It's my party, isn't it?
Yes, but when it's your party, you arrive late, and the later the better, especially because we want a big frenzy around the reveal that you are "anonymous."
I need to put you somewhere no one will see you.
so I'm supposed to just hide in here?
Yeah, you can sign books while you wait.
and do not come out until I tell you. - Okay.
I'm sorry.
no, no, it was me. I wasn't looking.
I'm on my way to an event. - Is it drinks with me?
I wish I could say it was, but it's a family thing.
come on. What sounds more fun?
your family... Or a dirty martini with a stranger?
well, a martini or two could be nice.
Flighty? Irresponsible? I'm gonna kill him.
I'm sorry. - Yes, you are.
Oh, I am so sorry Nate couldn't come.
not as sorry as Dan's going to be.
wonder where he is.
I'm Alessandra, Dan's agent. You must be his dad.
it is a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Humphrey, and you, Mrs. Humphrey.
Oh, you can call me Lily.
and this is Sloane Crosley, the best-selling author of "I Was Told There'd Be Cake."
which I am still in search of, so if you'll excuse me.
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
where is the man of the hour? He's early to everything.
I'm hiding him. He'll be out soon.
and you must be Mr. Charlie Trout. I have been dying to meet you.
care to join me for a drink?
you know, I just saw Graydon. Maybe we should go say hello.
nice meeting you. - Ciao.
I was nervous you wouldn't show up, considering your portrayal in the book.
why would I be upset? - I don't know.
your character's story is so tragic, even before he dies.
and the way it happens...
all I could think was how long you must have been hanging there before anybody found you.
I have plenty of staff. They would have found me immediately.
staff? Not friends or family?
makes it even worse.
Hello?
I'm looking for an Ivy Dickens.
Yeah. This is sh...
she? I figured as much.
don't bother lying or hanging up.
we met this morning when you were Charlie Rhodes. Remember me now?
Hey, do you know where Dan is?
can you believe what he wrote about me?
which part? Sabrina is glamorous, sexy, beautiful.
selfish, insensitive, shallow.
let me tell you, from experience, everyone loves a villain.
Yeah, I told Blair the same thing, but then I realize if that's true, why are you always alone?
not one word Have you seen Dan? - No. Have you?
did you see what he wrote about me?
no, I didn't have time to read all of it, just the parts about me.
me, too.
check the study.
Nate, hey, are you here? My agent has me locked in the study.
please tell me the party's good. - I decided not to come.
what? Why? Is everything okay?
no, dude. It's... It's not.
what? - I thought you... Derek? Really?
I mean, I can't believe I'm not even important enough to merit my own character.
I'm one of your best friends, Dan, at least I thought I was.
no, every writer condenses people for better dramatic effect.
Hemingway did it. Uh, Joseph Mitchell did it. It's, you know...
you have a lot of explaining to do, Humphrey!
I am so sorry I wasn't able to stop by.
Nate, I gotta call you back 'cause Blair and Serena are here.
Oh, right, because they're more important, which is why they got their own characters.
no, wait.
Nate is... - Furious? Yeah, because I am.
and I'm more furious, if that's even possible.
I could lose my job over this. - I could lose my fiance!
wait. What? I didn't read your parts.
he wrote that we had sex! - You slept with Dan?
no, you really think I would do that? - It's not what you think.
is this true? - Of course it's true.
this is why you had me kill your story and why you asked me not to read it.
I came here because I thought my suspicions ridiculous.
turns out the only thing ridiculous is me.
I should have known. - Dan, your father and stepmother...
Oh, great. You're all here. Perfect opportunity for... A photo!
everyone in?
looks like the best piece of fiction is that people... people are actually happy for Dan Humphrey.
inside.
is this what you've been trying to tell me all day?
no, because it never happened. It never happened.
I don't believe a word you say.
you said yourself that Dan has no imagination.
okay, uh, thanks, but, Louis, it didn't happen.
I would never lie to you. You know that.
I never know with you... And that's the problem.
we're gonna go check on the guests. Come on, Rufus.
I have no reason to stay here any longer.
you had better hope I can stop your fantasy life from destroying my real one.
Blair, I never wanted us to come between you two.
when are you gonna get it through your head?
there's no "us. " There never was!
there's nothing here but friendship, and even that's gone now.
please tell me it is time for my entrance.
not yet, but you'll be fine here with your friend.
Susan Baines was arrested today at her east Hampton estate for an alleged Ponzi scheme reminiscent of the Madoff case.
apparently, Ms. Baines' hedge fund, which has been funneling...
how did you know?
just a hunch.
but then I did my research.
quite a web you've spun.
but what I can't quite figure out is why.
maybe the people you've been lying to could explain it to me.
I didn't ask for any of it.
Serena's aunt, Carol Rhodes, paid me to impersonate her daughter Charlie so she could access her trust fund. It worked.
and I took the money and went back to my real life, only Serena found me and dragged me back here.
now I'm trapped.
so now you can't get out. Or maybe you don't want to.
that dress suits you, as does living in a penthouse, I'm sure.
I'm not... In it for the money.
maybe I was before, but now for the first time in my life,
I feel like I actually belong somewhere.
but you don't.
and when these people realize you're not one of them, they're gonna destroy you.
please don't tell them.
I won't.
I'm gonna protect you, if you let me.
what do you want?
you're making a big mistake.
in thinking that Blair could be trusted, yes.
she will always have her secrets. She can't exist without them.
you were right, after all.
you should never listen to me. If you read Dan's book, you know how I turn out.
you have a chance at having love in your life, not ending up alone...
hanging in a closet.
don't give up on your own fact over someone else's fiction.
I'm sorry you're hurt. - No, not hurt. Mystified.
in high school, you were the only one who saw me for who I really was or who I wanted to be.
you helped me be somebody that I was more proud of.
I didn't know.
do you even remember the girl that you fell in love with?
or just that she got so drunk on thanksgiving that she got grazed by a taxi or that she got married in Barcelona or slept with not one but two of her professors?
I hate to break it to you, but those things... Happened.
it's not the things. It's how you wrote about them.
that's the point. Dylan Hunter is a judgmental dick who can't even look at himself in the mirror.
my character comes off the worst of all of them.
he... He puts off his writing.
he misses job interviews. He ignores his grades. Why?
because he cares more for a pretty blonde than he does his own future, and in the end, none of his friends are happy for his success.
they all turn their backs on him, and he deserves it!
Yeah. He does.
I need to find Blair. I gotta make sure she's okay.
no, we're not done here.
I just messed up her engagement. I could ruin her life.
Yeah, and what about mine?
if you can't tell the difference between what I did to Blair and what I did to you, then maybe your portrayal in the book is more accurate than you thought.
that sounds exactly like something Dylan Hunter would say.
it's time. You ready for your big moment?
Absolutely.
everyone? Everyone. Hi.
I-I know you're not all here to hear me speak but to finally find out who is "anonymous.
it is with great pleasure that I introduce you to the amazingly special and very talented author of "inside..."
looks like Dan Humphrey's on the fast track from lonely boy to only boy.
Louis didn't return my calls all night.
I don't know if he'll ever speak to me again.
is that what you were trying to tell me yesterday?
have you two been having trouble?
no. Quite the contrary, in fact.
I wish I was telling you this at a better time, but...
I'm pregnant.
what? Oh, my gosh!
Blair, that's amazing!
wait. That's... That's good news, right?
well, I was happy. So happy.
but now what if I'm in this alone?
no, you're not alone. Never.
I know I may have been busy since I got back, but that doesn't mean I'm not here for you.
I can always count on you.
I just wish Louis felt the same about me.
I do.
I'm gonna get ready for work. I love you.
let me know if you need me.
don't. I'm ashamed enough at my behavior.
I know you have a complicated past, but you've been honest about it.
it's hard for me.
I want to believe, but every time I turn, there seems to be another secret.
that night at Constance, you gave me a choice.
and now I'm giving you one.
either you find a way to trust me, or you let me go.
I could never let you go.
thanks for seeing me. - Of course, Charles.
I'm so happy you called. It's been a long time.
Rufus isn't here if you need to talk.
seems like I'm always off on my own.
I thought you liked it that way.
I don't want to be the unrepentant bad boy who no one cares lives or dies.
it's just a book, Charles. - What if it isn't?
there are people that care so deeply for you if you would just let them.
Blair is lost to me.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Hey, how was the party?
Oh, I didn't go. Dan Humphrey wasn't exactly the friend I thought he was.
I'm sorry to hear it. I know how important loyalty is to you.
but I think I have something that might cheer you up.
I wanna introduce you to your new colleague.
what are you doing here?
I...needed a new job, so thank you for introducing me to Diana.
why do I get the feeling that there's more to this story?
Oh, a lady never tells. It's always better to stay mysterious.
why don't you show her around?
sure. Yeah. Welcome aboard.
thank you. - Come on in.
Hey, dad.
your reviews? I guess you have a lot of reading to do today.
I don't... I don't want you to get too excited, but "The New York Post" called your son the "Potential Voice of His Generation."
and... And "The New York Times" called the book... Where is it?
uh, yeah,"A searing portrayal of Manhattan's elite with just the right portion of pathos."
I- I had to double-check it to make sure they didn't say "pathetic,"
which is what, eh, all my friends think I am.
is everything okay?
well, last night was your big night. I didn't want to ruin it for you, but...
well, it kinda went there on its own. What... What's going on? Did you not like the book?
of course I did. You're a beautiful writer.
just... Broke... Broke my heart.
wait. Dad...
I gave up my career to raise you, and I never regretted it, not once...
until yesterday when I read what you really think about me.
has been turned trophy husband who married for money.
no, that is not... That's not what I think of you.
you more than anybody should understand artistic license.
I never expected to be your hero, but...
I just didn't think I'd end up the fool.
in literature, there are thousands of endings...
some happy, some sad.
some end with a twist.
I want this book.
well... Here it is.
I want the movie rights to this book , and since you're good friends with the author, that shouldn't be a problem, right?
we're not exactly on good terms right now.
look, your reputation reflects directly on me, and frankly, this book leaves yours in tatters.
so prove to me I made the right choice hiring you.
I want this book, and you're going to get it for me.
so whatever you did to Dan Humphrey, undo it, okay?
you have a week.
Yeah, but I don't know why it says contact here...
some stories open the door for something more.
and then there are fairy tale endings where the girl gets her prince.
and endings that turn you introspective about your own life and your place in the world.
Hello?
how's my star? Have you been reading the reviews?
Yeah, a few. - Well, I have great news.
the book is now number 4 on Amazon, and your reading today at the Union Square Barnes and noble is filling up fast.
great. That... That's great.
and then there's the ending that you saw coming a mile away and yet somehow still takes you by surprise.
so I'll see you there at 6: 00. And I know.
I don't have to tell you to be on time 'cause you'll be early.
Oh, how many tickets do you want me to put on hold for your friends and family?
none. It will just be me.
but don't worry, my upper east side friends.
this story isn't ending.
we're just at the start of a brand-new chapter.
into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
I want the movie rights to this book, and since you're good friends with the author, that shouldn't be a problem.
uh, we're not exactly on good terms right now.
I told alessandra that i'm giving you the book rights.
I do have one condition.
I want to write the screenplay.
what are those?
my late husband bart had his investigator research our whole family.
there's a story in that safe. I saw it myself.
I want to return these to you.
and... You're not gonna use them ever?
anything of value in these was already on "gossip girl.
Dr. Eliza barnes.
you look like you need to talk. - I do.
you never had a childhood, so you behave like a child in the worst ways.
your superficial connections and lack of authentic emotion leave you isolated and alone.
throwing away your loyal family for a fiancee you shouldn't trust.
do you really believe she has no other secrets?
I would never lie to you. You know that.
I never know with you.
I'd like to meet so I could tell you more in person.
I'm more than willing to pay for your time.
they say the road of life is long and winding, so it's important to mark the milestones along your way, from picking your bridesmaids...
so many minions. How you ever going to decide?
tryouts begin after breakfast.
all right, let's put the bar up front, the d. j. In back, and the caterers can sit up in the bullpen and we toss out those moving boxes.
Nate, can I add one more thing to your to-do list?
definitely.
to christening your boss' new desk...
Oh, my...
landing on your first best seller list...
number nine. "inside" by daniel humphrey.
what did, uh, lincoln hawk's first single debut at?
eight.
Ah, but don't pay too much attention to that stuff. That was the '90s.
to finally asking for help.
so how are you feeling today?
fit as a fiddle.
but keep your eyes on the road, upper east siders, or you could get lost along the way.
that was a productive morning.
Yeah, I got a lot accomplished in a short amount of time, didn't i?
don't gloat. If anyone deserves top marks, it's me.
now zip me up.
so I was thinking about the party tonight, and I was thinking that maybe you could be my date.
you're joking.
you're not?
I mean, isn't it time we finally told the world we're a couple?
I can't think of a better time than tonight.
I can't think of a worse one.
tonight's the public launch of my new media empire.
I'm showing new york city who I am.
besides, we both knew that female bosses can't mix business and pleasure without people whispering about them behind their back.
okay, but I'd still like you to meet a few of my friends.
I mean, can we at least talk about that?
of course.
right after you and charlie deliver the new "spectator" tablets to all our v. i.p. Guests.
you ever heard of a messenger service?
so some unattractive delivery guy can hand them to an assistant who's just gonna sell them on ebay?
I don't think so.
here is your list.
I mean, seriously? This is like four pages long.
don't pout.
Charlie, you are east side. Nate, you're west.
and I have to run because I am late for a meeting with an old friend from l. a.
I knew I shouldn't have worn heels today.
the dream starts the same every time.
they have a habit of doing that.
I'm taking an early morning stroll in my new berluti wingtips.
I look up, and a block away is the most magnificent skyscraper I've ever seen.
I have to get inside it, but every time I round the corner, it's still a block away.
so what do you do?
I start to run, but as soon as I reach it - You wake up.
what do you think the dream is about?
my father's tragic death?
my mother's secret life?
or perhaps my chronic oral fixation.
I appreciate your sense of humor, charles, but
but you think it's just a defense mechanism against intensive therapy.
be honest. You know you're holding back.
how can you be so sure i'm hiding something?
maybe I'm wrong, but I feel there's a piece of the puzzle still missing.
it's not your mother or your father.
there's someone you're not telling me about.
good morning, blair.
don't you just adore us?
why do I feel like there's a request coming?
not a request. A special dispensation.
for what? - Scheming and manipulating.
who do you work for?
Louis, can't you just turn a blind eye for...
let's say 24 hours? - Blair...
all I'd be doing is spending the day with my former minions.
maybe some light waterboarding involved.
but I've been so good for so long.
and once I'm her serene highness of monaco, all meddling will be prohibe.
queen b. Need last hurrah.
are you sure that's such a good idea?
forgive me. I've just never understood this upper east side tradition of yours.
I know, and that's why we're perfect together.
you don't have the scheme gene like I do.
you don't get the itch. - Maybe it hormonal.
darling, it's just one day.
je reviens tout de suite.
okay. I give up. I'll look away.
but only until the party tonight.
that's more than enough time.
Commenced!
don't worry, my love.
nobody will get hurt... That badly.
Hey, dan's on his way up.
Serena, I want you to meet a dear old friend of mine - Diana payne.
I think you came to a party at my house in los angeles, but I was indisposed.
so good to finally meet you. - So nice to meet you, too.
Serena's my latest find.
a month ago, her job was getting my director three shots over ice.
now I've got her optioning best sellers for me.
I'm going to go get a tart cherry juice and call david o. Russell.
I'll be back in time for our meeting.
it's such a small world.
my good friend nate archibald actually works for you, and my cousin, charlie rhodes.
Oh, yes.
well, they've both been instrumental in helping me rebrand "the spectator.
I hope you'll be coming to our launch party tonight.
Oh, no, I wasn't planning on it. - Oh, but you should.
in fact, someone like you with your influence should have her own place to speak her mind.
have you ever thought about blogging for a web site?
I know my readers would love to hear every detail about your life.
Oh, well, there's already somebody who's all over that.
I'm not really a fan of her work.
gossip girl doesn't have the monopoly on serena van der woodsen, does she?
no, but I've been hurt enough by what she's said that I could never willingly take part in something like that.
I hope you'll come to the party anyway.
it'd be great to keep talking.
Bye.
as faithful minions through the years, you've each earned a chance to be immortalized as a bridesmaid in my royal wedding, but legally, I must warn you, not everyone will survive the tryouts.
so I've drafted a waiver for you to sign in the event of a catastrophe.
Kati, penelope, nice to see constance so ably represented.
Jessica, columbia's finest.
Blair, it's always been my dream to be your bridesmaid
do yourself a favor and stop talking right now.
even pippa knew when to pipe down.
Where's nelly yuki?
Yale, where she got in and you didn't, plus she hates you, remember?
well, an odd number just won't do.
we need another contestant.
you're the maid of honor's cousin.
you should be in the mix, too. what are you doing right now?
nothing?
then get in line... If you dare.
Hello, doctor.
what's this?
the rest of what I owe you.
I told you it'd be worth your while.
now you can settle all of your father's debts.
what do you want me to do?
just make sure my fiancee will never fall for him again.
Louis, that's up to blair.
no. It's up to you to turn chuck back into the monster he was for the first 20 years of his life.
he's a time bomb.
find his fuse and light it.
looks like louis is about to make young bass' road to recovery a very bumpy ride.
better buckle up, chuck.
Dr. Barnes, what are you doing here?
a house call is a little out of the ordinary in my line of work, but I felt our last interaction ended too abruptly. May-may I sit?
of course.
I was hoping that being in your environment might help.
well, I applaud your persistence, Dr. Barnes, but I've searched the far corners of my mind, and I'm not hiding anything, from you or myself.
I'm an open book.
then let's skip to the chapter about blair waldorf.
I live in this city. I read the papers just like everyone else.
you've done your homework, but I don't see how my history with blair or the tabloid fodder it produces is really relevant to my therapy.
it's relevant if the blair is the source of your suffering.
aren't you upset that the love of your life is marrying someone else?
I let blair go. Let's leave it at that.
you're actually telling me you're not furious.
next chapter.
have you ever thought it's your denial of these feelings that's giving you nightmares?
expressing your rage and anger is part of your healing process.
you can't move on until you let it out.
you have to face that you didn't let blair go.
you lost her to someone else.
you don't know what I did.
but yes.
maybe there is something else I need to do if I'm ever going to move on.
I don't want to lie to you. I don't want to lie to myself.
if I've really let blair go, I don't need this anymore.
it's beautiful.
I bought it to give to her.
I've been keeping hold of it ever since.
and really what I should do is just return it.
if that's what you need to do, you should do it.
you take it. Just...
give it to charity or something. I don't care.
just- Just-just take it away.
thank you.
so, Mr. Screenwriter, are you ready for your first ever development meeting?
I think so, as long as you guys don't want to change the ending or the beginning or all the stuff in the middle.
don't worry. You'll love working with jane.
there he is!
we're so excited.
Dan, this is natalie, my exec at warners.
Hi. So nice to - I love, love, love your book
the characters, the voice, everything.
honestly, you should just transfer the novel straight to final draft.
copy, paste, done.
thank you. Do you don't have any notes before I start writing?
well, we'd love if you could open up the world of upper east side a little bit more.
rich people are so hard to like.
maybe you can add someone more relatable?
I... Thought I did that already.
I - I think dan is referring to his main character, dylan hunter.
he'll appeal to everyone.
he starts off as an innocent from brooklyn who quotes hawthorne and screens fellini films? I don't think so.
we need a real outsider as a hero.
a tragic backstory would give him more to overcome.
maybe he's an orphan. - Wait. Wait
now another thought that occurred to me was to "glee" this up.
you know, music - Originals or covers.
okay, stop. What's going on?
I thought we were talking about turning this into an important independent film.
Dan, relax, we're just talking.
about turning my book into "newsies.
"inside" is my life.
and thank you so much, but I don't need anyone to tell me how to write it.
a royal wedding is more than just the most glamorous event on the social calendar.
it is also the most dangerous.
people will try to kidnap you and break you for the details.
paparazzi will tap your phones.
I need to know who of you is going to crack under the pressure.
the contest today will simulate how you perform your bridesmaids duties under extreme duress.
now fall in line!
dressing me for my wedding day means attending to my every need, no matter how big or small.
adjust for reception! Cinch that train!
Penelope... She has to pee!
where secret wedding location?! - We don't know!
who design ms. Blair wedding dress?! - We can't tell you that!
good one, jessica. Now block that baby bump!
blocking.
what baby bump?
lets go, girls! Faster! Who wants it?! You know the rules!
you trip, you're out! You spill, you're out!
come on!
nice work, charlie. I like what I see.
I'm sorry. I...
you sicken me.
may I help you?
Yeah. I work for diana payne, and she wanted me to hand-deliver keith gessen the new "spectator" tablet.
it'll serve as his invitation for the party tonight.
Keith doesn't need an invitation, since he'll be attending with diana.
Oh, but I'll gladly take the tablet myself.
wait. So... He's going as her date?
Hello! They've been going out for two months.
I thought you worked in media.
Hey.
I know this morning was a total disaster, but nobody blames you.
whatever jane sent you here to say, why don't you just say it?
well, we both think that you should waive your right to write the script.
why would I do that?
because if you write it, your project will be stuck in development hell.
you'll write a draft. A year later, you'll still be rewriting it, and you'll never give them what they want because you're too close to it.
and that's not even the point.
well, it sounds like it was.
Dan, You're a huge novelist now.
I don't know about huge. I mean, I'm number nine.
and next week, you'll be number one.
I'll take two. I'm not greedy.
seriously, you should be focusing on your next best seller.
let us hire an "a" list writer like-like an akiva goldsman, somebody who jane can't bully, somebody who gets great movies made and who will honor your book faithfully.
you really think you could get someone like him to write it?
Absolutely. Jane works with oscar winners all the time.
but how can I guarantee that she's not just gonna screw it up?
because I won't let her.
she may not know this world, but I do, and I will protect your story and you.
careful, s.
I have your word? - You have my word.
everybody knows the road to hell is paved with good intentions and shady bosses.
Hello? - hey.
there you are. Why aren't you back here yet?
I got a little hung up at keith gessen's office.
were you ever even gonna tell me that you're bringing him as your date tonight?
of course. I wanted to say something this morning, but, um
but you were too busy lecturing me on how you can't mix business with pleasure, right?
Keith's just business, really.
you are both.
but no one can know that I am.
not right now.
I know you don't understand, but you need to trust me.
no, You know what I need to do? Is rethink this whole relationship.
get me charlie rhodes.
okay, dan's off the project.
take a bow, serena.
you're a star.
how'd you accomplish it?
well, I just convinced him that-that he and his novel would be better served by a top-tier screenwriter.
and he will be.
sorkin's agent called right after you left.
is adapting "inside.
Oh, my g- what? that's-that's incredible.
how did you get that to happen so fast?
I had sorkin lined up for a week.
his agent and I were just waiting.
for... Me to convince dan to quit?
so this explains your the musical" pitch.
come on. I always knew that dan was never going to work out.
I just gave him a little nudge.
be happy. Sorkin is a good thing.
I just wish we could have spared everyone the drama this morning.
are you kidding?
Dan coming in this morning did more for this project than you'll ever know.
Why?
because we got to see what this movie should really be.
a self-important teenager who betrays his friends for fame and fortune.
inside" will be the next "social network.
we're going to zuckerberg him.
Jane, this - This isn't fair.
I prefer to let the audience decide what's fair or not.
Dan is not like that.
why don't I put a dinner on the books for all of us?
and this way, you'll see.
the next time I see dan will be at cannes when I'm shaking his grateful hand on the dais.
I have a call to make.
see you at the party tonight?
congratulations, girls.
you've survived the most physically and mentally challenging day of your lives, and all you have to show for it are a few bruises.
now for the final round, you will be accompanying me and my prince to the fabulous "spectator" launch party tonight.
we're going to play a little game with one of the guests there.
well, who's the target?
a boy, of course. - I'm listening.
at the wedding, you'll be the apple of every bachelor's eye.
so I need to know who is going to bag a baron and who's going to embarrass me.
with a busboy.
exactly.
so... Tonight, whoever's the first to get a kiss from one of new york's most eligible bachelors wins the right to call herself my...Royal bridesmaid.
so tell us, who is it?
Dorota? Will you do the honors?
I am so all over this.
Yes! Yes. - Oh, my god.
Hello?
why is nate calling me from keith gessen's office?
all I asked you to do was make a few simple deliveries to a few specific people, - and you botched it. - I know.
I'm so sorry, but blair's having a competition to pick her bridesmaids, and if I win, I can cover the royal wedding for "the spectator.
then you'd better win, for your sake.
I just... Have one more task to complete.
Hey. - hey. Uh, are you free tonight?
Jane was-was hoping that you would be my guest to "the spectator" party.
let me guess.
Jane loves me again now that I quit the movie.
I think she just wants to get to know you better - The real you.
so be super nice, okay?
I'm always nice. Yeah, I'll see you tonight.
Spotted-s. Trying to navigate a slippery slope
but she's not the only accident waiting to happen.
Hey. Did you get my texts?
I... Turned my phone off, actually.
are you okay?
I'm, uh... I'm good.
he says, teeth clenched.
come on. Let me help.
I'm really good with other people's problems.
not so much my own, but...
well, there's this - There's this girl.
and I asked her to be my date to the party tonight.
and she said "no.
which was fine, until I find out that she's bringing another guy.
do you think that she's trying to let you down easy?
easy's not her style, no.
well, then she's trying to make you jealous.
trust me, nate. We're all the same.
okay, so what do I do?
fight fire with fire.
take me as your date.
well, no. I wouldn't wanna - I wouldn't wanna ruin your night.
you won't.
pick me up at 6: 00.
you're getting excited, aren't you?
you're getting excited. Come on. - Dr. Barnes.
you shouldn't be here.
and I wouldn't be, if you answered any of my calls.
I told you, I'm done.
I can't be responsible for destroying a young man who's doing everything he can to heal himself.
and what about our deal?
as much as it would have helped, here's your refund.
at the tone, please record your message.
Dr. Barnes, it's chuck.
I think I'm in trouble.
can you meet me tonight?
when you drive chuck over the edge, it's you who will wind up roadkill.
so how was you day?
just what I needed. Old habits die hard.
hello.
if they die at all.
what are they doing here?
I thought we agreed we'd be done by tonight.
and I will be, my dear.
the girls just have one more tiny, little thing to take care of.
Where's nate?
Where's charlie?
game on.
you look amazing.
I wanted to offer my sincerest congratulations. Chuck bass.
Diana payne. So nice to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you, and let me just say, the best of it does you no justice.
I'm sorry. Have we met before?
not that I can recall.
it's funny. Just looking at you now, I could have sworn
I think I'd remember. Enjoy the party.
Chuck. - Your highness, always a pleasure.
give it a rest, bass.
I'm sorry. My friend is here. dan.
Jane, hey. Thank you so much for inviting me. I appreciate it.
of course. I'm just so happy you can make it.
Serena, look, I found dan.
did you already tell him we got sorkin to write the movie?
what? No. That's incredible.
I know. Now your character will talk even faster than you do.
you-you mind if I call my agent and tell her? I'll be right back.
don't think I don't know what you're doing by bringing him here.
you can't guilt-trip me into changing my mind about the lead character.
I just wanted you to get to know the real dan.
He-he's... Genuine and caring and funny.
the zuckerberg version is the better story.
the better movie.
I gave dan my word that I would protect him.
he's one of my best friends.
please don't do this to him.
it's already done.
and you know what?
I'm taking you off this project, effective immediately.
like dan, you're just too close to it.
Nate, these offices are so big.
you have to show me yours.
Oh, I'd love to. Yeah, we got a lot of, uh
there you are.
I was waiting for you at the bar.
well, you'll have to keep waiting.
Nate just promised me a tour.
of the office. - I'll come with.
no, I wanna see your "spectator," not hers.
sorry, charlie.
Ooh, is that a hellman-chang table?
Oh, my!
Serena, you came after all. I'm delighted.
so... What do you think of "the spectator"?
everyone seems to be having fun. - Except for you.
what I can't help but pry. Of course you don't have to tell me.
I just... Got myself into a situation that's gonna hurt somebody I really care about.
I thought I could fix it tonight, but I - I can't.
maybe I can.
I'm quite the problem solver. - I don't think you wanna know.
it involves a friend of yours. - Jane?
now you have to tell me.
it's... It's about the book option I got for her.
I need to kill the project.
give me two seconds, and it'll vanish.
thank you, but-but I'll- I'll figure it out on my own.
you just said you couldn't.
Jane and I have history.
she doesn't always like to be reminded of it, and it's been a while since I did.
what kind of history?
some things are best left to the imagination.
so... How bad do you want your problem to go away?
Jane. - yes?
a word.
Oh, just kiss him and win already.
anybody with eyes can see nate has a huge crush on you.
I give up.
I would, but I'm starting to feel like i'm not nate's type.
Hello?! Nate doesn't have a type.
he's like derek jeter.
well, when he saw you, he said that you were the hottest girl at constance.
Nate said that?
Oh, my god. What else did he say?
something about how you were the only girl at constance he wished that he had hooked up with but never did.
until now.
Thanks, man. I appreciate that. We just, um...
let's do this.
Penelope! What did I tell you about consorting with the help?
you're dismissed.
what? It's not my fault she tripped.
uh, you leaving already? - I'm sorry. I have to go.
I was hoping we could talk more about the movie.
what movie? It's dead.
if you want to know why, talk to your friend serena.
I know the night's still young and the bar's still open, but I wanted to take a moment to thank everybody for coming.
it means so much to me to know that if a bomb went off right this second, new york media would be over.
thanks for being my date. - Of course.
I just hope we were able to make whoever you're seeing jealous.
I don't know. I don't even think she really cared.
let's make her care.
I'm game if you are. - Yeah?
we are going to be different from "gossip girl and other anonymous sites which traffic in damaging rumors and innuendo.
I'm sorry. Where was i?
the "spectator" is only going to print facts.
if you did it, you deserve to get caught, and we're gonna catch you.
so with apologies to my other esteemed editors, starting tonight, I'm gonna be poaching your best reporters and stealing all your best stories.
I have a story for you.
so let's hear it, Mr. Bass.
my therapist, Dr. Eliza barnes, has been using hypnosis to coerce me into performing...
unspeakable acts.
I am Dr. Barnes, and I promise you that none of this is true.
it's okay, chuck.
y - you're in a very vulnerable psychological state right now.
I wonder why.
maybe because I just found out you were taking money to reveal confidential information about me.
now that's a story I can print... If you have proof.
Chuck, stop. Why are you doing this?
if you don't believe me, you should ask your fiance.
he's the one who paid her.
don't worry, b. You're still marrying a prince...Of fools.
Blair, wait.
please, I know how upset you must be.
after all this arguing about my scheming, what you've been doing is even worse.
but I can explain.
what possible explanation could you have for...
paying chuck's therapist to spy on him?
I found the paternity test...
the one that you'd torn to pieces.
Oh, my god. You didn't tell me you weren't sure who the father was.
no, I... I had to get the test.
Yeah, so you could decide who to be with?
no. So we both could have peace of mind, knowing that what I prayed for in my heart was true.
the paternity test showed me that some part of you thought you might still have a choice to make.
and I needed you to see that chuck will always be the wrong one.
Louis... I don't know how many more times I can say this, but chuck and I can never work.
you know that for certain? - I do.
so does he. And so should you.
Chuck destroys everything and everybody in his life.
and he'll never change.
but what's scaring me is that you're changing into him.
did you just kill my movie?
only because I had no other choice. But I did it for you.
for me? Are you kidding?
listen, please - Tell me one thing.
was this your plan from the very beginning?
what? - Admit it.
you hate your character in the book so much you couldn't stand to see this made into a movie.
millions of people might judge you, and we all know how much you like that.
actually, for the record, having the project killed had nothing to do with my image and everything to do with yours.
Jane was gonna do a hatchet job on you, and now I'm gonna get fired for stopping her.
that was fun. - More fun that you expected?
a lot more. I mean, maybe we should just stage another make-out session.
you know, just for us.
Congratulations! Looks like you won blair's contest.
wait, what? What is she talking about?
didn't you know? This was all a game.
Charlie only kissed you so she could be one of blair's bridesmaids.
for the "spectator" of course.
guess she left that part out.
Nate, I'm sorry.
don't fret, charlie.
I'm sure nate wasn't completely honest with you either.
were you, honey?
right then. I'd better get back to my real date.
keep up the good work, charlie.
Cheers.
what, so you used me to get a story?
the "girl" you're seeing is our boss?!
well, if it isn't the good doctor.
I thought you should know i'm gonna shut down my practice.
Why? I know people say therapy's a waste of time, but you did wonders with my trust issues.
I understand you're angry. I don't expect you to ever forgive me.
I just thought you should know s wasn't paying me for information alone.
he wanted me to drive you into a rage, to turn you into this monster you apparently used to be.
Louis is so threatened by you that he wanted to remind blair
why she chose him.
maybe louis is right. - He doesn't have to be.
you can change.
do you remember this morning when I asked you about blair?
I was trying to provoke you.
but you chose something else, something better.
you chose to let go.
continue down that road, and I'll bet you'll find some peace.
I've always wondered what that felt like.
good luck.
and I'm sorry. I really did want to help.
Spotted-chuck bass standing at the crossroads.
looks like we're gonna have to watch his every step.
Serena... Word on the street is you're back on the job market.
you don't waste any time, do you?
not when I know what I want.
there must be some way I can convince you to write a blog for "the spectator.
not if it's about the upper east side or anyone who lives there, including me.
I'm sorry. I know that I owe you a favor, but I don't wanna be the next gossip girl.
I - I don't believe in attacking people online and spreading rumors.
neither do i, which is why I wanna take gossip girl down.
how?
everyone reads her, and whether they admit it or not, everyone posts.
this city is addicted to her.
only because she writes about people like you.
think about it.
if you and your friends are the main reason people care about gossip girl, and starting tomorrow, everyone can read about you straight from the source, that would make "gossip girl" irrelevant, wouldn't it?
I don't know.
Yes, you do.
Serena, this is a chance to have your own voice, to stop the lies and to finally control your own image.
aren't you tired of swimming in gossip girl's fishbowl?
well, I'd have to do it my own way.
I'd expect nothing less.
come by tomorrow, and we'll brainstorm together.
okay. Good night.
no more games. No more secrets.
either we're in this for the world to see, or we end this right here.
somebody here to apologize.
well, I can't say I want to hear it right now, but...
tell louis i'll see him upstairs. - Not louis.
what are you doing here?
I - I don't have the energy to rehash tonight's hysterics.
I think you should leave.
I'm not here to apologize about what happened tonight.
then... What are you here to apologize for?
everything else.
I'm sorry for losing my temper the night you told me louis proposed to you.
I'm sorry for not waiting longer at the empire state building.
I'm sorry for treating you like property.
I'm sorry...
I didn't tell you I loved you when I knew I did.
but most of all, i'm sorry that I gave up on us when you never did.
thank you.
I hope never giving up on people isn't gonna be my downfall.
that's why you're going to be an amazing mother.
you're always there for the people you love, even when they don't deserve it.
you know that's never gonna change.
it's okay if it has to.
starting tonight, I'm going to take care of myself.
is that all?
Yeah.
they say every road comes to an end, but sometimes the end feels just like the beginning, - even when you think you've come a long way...
dad? What, uh, what are you still doing here?
after I talked to you at the party, jonathan karp called.
he got an advance copy of next week's best seller list.
I'm not number one.
did I go up at all? - You dropped off the list.
but when I told him the news about aaron sorkin, he said a big movie deal announcement like that will have the books flying off the shelves again.
the movie's dead, dad. It's over. I'm-i'm done.
you can suddenly find yourself right back where you started, because every journey is fraught with twists and turns...
you know, charlie, you're becoming more trouble than you're worth.
I had no idea you were the one nate was trying to make jealous.
I just wanted to get the inside scoop on blair's wedding.
well... Now you know, and so does the rest of the world.
Nate's mine.
do I make myself clear?
good.
because I'd hate to have to run a story tomorrow about a poor girl from florida who clark rockefeller'ed the upper east side.
and one false step could spell disaster.
but no matter what...
you still have to stay the course and forge your own path.
no, louis, I - I know you're sorry. You should go on your trip.
we can talk when you get back.
promise.
besides, a few days apart would be good for us.
because there's no going back now.
and it looks like this one's going to be the ride of our lives.
gossip girl here
your one and only source into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
the truth is I was jealous. You're the star of Dan's book.
do you live in this building? - No, I work here.
can I help you find something?
I'm looking for my ex-girlfriend, Ivy Dickens.
I'm here with someone, and I should really go find her.
her name's serena. - Serena Van Der Woodsen?
what happened to your date? - My date stood me up.
the only way for Blair to move on is if she thinks I never will.
I had to kiss her to set her free.
I just found out you were taking money to reveal information about me.
Chuck destroys everything, and he'll never change.
but what's scaring me is that you're changing into him.
no, Louis, you should go on your trip.
besides, a few days apart would be good for us.
a shower is supposed to make you feel fresh and clean, but on the upper east side, they're where I get the most dirt.
and b.'s bridal shower tonight promises to be an absolutely filthy affair.
the only two people left off the list - number one...
honestly, a mutt? No wonder Blair chose Louis over you.
totally right call, b.t. - dubs, 'cause you are so the opposite of royalty.
still, how royally miffed are you that you weren't even invited to the shower tonight?
girls, I have been trying very hard lately to be good.
yet I don't feel the slightest pang of guilt unleashing my attack dog right now.
and I should warn you. He's trained to go after fake prada.
good boy, monkey.
as for number two?
in high school,"D. Got left off the list because no one knew who he was.
now it's because they know too well.
looks like lonely boy needs to change his name to 'banished boy'.
really, guys? Thank you for the support.
well, listen, I mean, at least they're still talking about you.
if they weren't, i'd start worrying.
well, that might happen soon, since "inside" is off the best sellers list.
but the rest of the book tour went better, right?
Yeah, it did. It did much better.
I mean, my hand's still kinda sore from having to sign all those copies.
see? Just give it time. Things will turn around.
Charlie, how are you feeling?
fine, thanks. Hi, dan.
what's with her?
I should go talk to her.
Rufus, the table and linen delivery people are gonna be here any second.
I can't believe I agreed to throw a party we aren't even able to attend.
you are such a good mom. - Thank you.
well, I think I'll pass on watching you guys set up for a party that I'm not invited to.
who is it?
someone completely undeserving or your love and affection.
I come bearing gifts - Every perfume Santa Maria Novella has to offer.
feel free to bash the imperial lavender over my head if you'd like.
that won't be necessary.
I know I did some really stupid things before I left, but I've come back a better man.
I promise you.
I believe you.
and I'm glad because I need you to be your best prince charming at our shower tonight.
what are all these?
hostess presents for Serena.
I had some pieces flown in from her favorite antique store in paris.
it's the least I could do to say thank you for whatever perfect evening she has planned for us.
they're beautiful.
but how-how do you know it's going to be perfect?
because Serena's my best friend, and she knows what I like better than anybody.
I'm sure it'll be a lovely party.
But? What-what are you saying?
nothing. It's just, I've done some thinking while I was gone, and I'm starting to wonder if your friends really have your best interests at heart.
Hey, thanks for coming by on a saturday. I really appreciate it.
I know I've been critical of some of the choices you've made in the past, but I couldn't be more proud of everything you accomplished here.
well, I'm working hard.
and I have to say, it feels good to have gotten this far on my own.
Nate, I need you to approve the layout for the new style section.
and who might this be?
my grandfather, William Van Der Bilt. This is my boss, Diana Payne.
Oh, it's a pleasure, Diana.
I'm very impressed by your whole organization. Congratulations.
I couldn't do it without your grandson. He's our rising star.
Nate, the graphic department's waiting. - All right.
I'll see your grandfather out. - All right.
thank god!
why haven't you returned any of my calls? I'm totally freaking out.
what's going on?
Diana fired me.
my ex-boyfriend just shows up out of nowhere.
I feel like the truth is gonna come out any second if I don't just leave right
listen to me. You can't go anywhere.
if you disappear, Cece could cut off my trust for good.
sorry, but that's your problem.
actually, it's your problem, because if the money stops, then I have nothing to lose, and I'll make sure whatever happens to me happens to you, too.
I didn't get mad when you didn't want to move out of here.
I didn't get upset when you didn't want to convert to Catholicism.
that has nothing to do with my friends.
Yes, it does. It's about the sacrifices you make for your partner.
and what have you sacrificed?
you spent your whole trip bonding with your family, who hates me.
they're my family, Blair.
but I've created some much needed distance between me and them, and I think you should do the same with your so-called friends.
this just in.
we hear B. took a paternity test to find out which daddy makes three.
see? This is exactly the type of thing I'm talking about.
you think someone I know sent that?
your friends know no loyalty.
each one rats out the next, and you and I get sucked right into it.
my friends and I have grown up. We're not like that anymore.
whoever sent that is clearly from your bloodline - namely your sister Beatrice.
as if she would do that right after we made up.
this was one of your friends, and I'll prove it to you.
hmm, well, good luck, because I happen to know my friends always have my back.
Serena? I know you're busy with something for tonight, but I really need your help.
sorry, B. can't talk. Too much work. Later!
I don't appreciate you just turning up unannounced like that.
would you mind telling me what's going on?
I was about to ask you the same thing.
I woke up this morning to find a big picture of you in "the new yorker,"
with Nate in the corner as "the man by your side.
it's supposed to be the other way around, remember?
sorry. I don't control every publication in New York.
my goal was to remake Nate, not to make you a star.
it's time for you to step aside, give him "the spectator."
what? That wasn't part of the deal.
Nate's got talent, but he's still green. He's just not ready.
since I am the majority investor in this entire operation, it's within my power to fire you and put him in charge.
all I need is another month to achieve my goal.
that's too long.
you have three days, or you're out of a job.
Humphrey, you lost? What are you doing here?
I thought since you're the only other person not invited to Blair's shower, - we could hang out today. - What did you have in mind?
a trip to the IFC center to catch a film no one's heard of, then to Shakespeare & Company to see who's not buying your book?
no, see, you're the new and improved Chuck Bass. I thought...
you could help me overhaul my own image.
you're willing to get a haircut and change your clothes?
no. - Then I'm not sure what I can do.
fine. Then just make the day go away.
I-I-I will-I will do whatever wildly offensive thing you can think of.
you've persuaded me.
so these two can go over there. - Excuse me.
sorry. I'm looking for someone named Ivy.
Yeah, she's probably with the caterers.
excuse me? Be careful. That's lalique.
no, sorry. I think some people here might call her "Charlie."
but I've always known her as "Ivy Dickens."
seems Charlie's in hot water...
and she's about to get burned.
um, I'm a little confused here. Charlie, help me out?
okay.
I never wanted to have to tell you this, but...
for some time now, I've been pretending to be...
Ivy Dickens. - I don't understand.
my mom never wanted me to grow up with the burden of the Rhodes name.
she claimed it ruined her whole life.
people made all kinds of assumptions about her, used her for her money.
she just never wanted that to happen to me. So...
she made me change my name.
and you know what? I was happy to, because...
then... I knew people like you, max, really liked me for me.
you just never know who you can trust or what people's true motives are. You know?
I knew your mother was behind this. This is just classic carol.
last spring, when I said I went to visit my family, I really was.
I just never told you who they were.
we've got a big problem.
I just talked to the board, and they said we're not getting enough eyeballs to the web site.
but our numbers are good. They're rising every day.
not fast enough. They said "gossip girl's" still getting more hits.
and unless we can find a way to top her in the next 72 hours, i'm out of a job.
what? - Yeah.
Oh, that's-that's- That's not fair.
I mean, these things take time. Didn't they see "the New Yorker"?
they gave me a deadline and a goal, and I haven't met it.
so you have any suggestions for attracting more readers, and fast?
Serena's blog's getting some traction.
maybe we can convince her to write something a bit more personal.
unless you have pictures of serena in bed with both "hunger games" boys, that's not gonna cut it.
well, then we gotta go straight to the source - Attack gossip girl directly.
too bad we can't hack into her phone.
well... Keep me posted.
whatever you could do, i'll be forever grateful.
Hey, Eeric, it's Nate. Listen, uh, I have kind of a strange question for you.
I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, you and I have run out of time.
they're coming for you, Neo, and I don't know what they're going to do.
at last.
Oh, this is awesome. You should try this. No?
welcome, Neo.
this is all awesome
not just the bruschetta but the whole thing - Me, you, Keanu.
I never pegged you for a "matrix" fan.
something I learned early on
never watch "a clockwork orange" when you're stoned.
takes your mind to places it has no business going.
like to blair's shower tonight.
that is one thing I am not gonna think about - Like, not at all.
nor should you. - I agree.
I-you know, I could easily spend the rest of my life obsessing over why Serena didn't invite me to the party.
I mean, she-she-she really should have invited me to the party.
it's like she wants me to stay an outsider for the rest of my life.
first she kills my movie, and then she kills my social life.
have you ever thought it might be your own fault?
no.
Humphrey, you wrote an entire novel about being an outsider.
it's how you define yourself.
but if that's not who you wanna be anymore, the only person who can change that is you.
what you need to do is stop with the neurotic navel-gazing...
and start being like our friend Neo here - A man of action.
and it just so happens that action and her friend are begging you to take them into nate's bedroom while I take monkey for a stroll.
Serena has been so tight-lipped about the preparations,
I haven't a clue what to wear.
should I be ladylike in De La Renta, avant-garde in Alaia, or magnificent in Mcqueen? What?
you know we can't tell you anything. - We're sworn to secrecy.
what is this,"the help"?
I will not tolerate this insubordination.
are you her minions or mine?
J - just give me a hint as to the size of the gathering and the level of formality, just so I don't show up overly fabulous, if there is such a thing.
actually, Serena's been so slammed with work and her blog, she hasn't had time to plan anything elaborate.
so it's going to be a rather... Intimate affair.
intimate?
okay. - Yes. Dress casual.
um, I think the line from the Evite was "jeans okay."
casual?
jeans. Evite?
she's really playing up this whole "people's princess" angle.
I'm sure she at least got a decent caterer- Jean-Georges? Michael White?
I'd settle for Batali if I had to.
I think she's doing Greek food...
like gyros.
from some fancy food truck parked next to dozens of other fancier food trucks.
from the cart on 59th and Lex.
just like the street food you had on your first date with Louis.
it's an homage.
Oh, my god! - I know.
but what else could we do? She's your maid of honor.
if you'll excuse me, I've gotta go kill myself...
or max out my credit card, whichever comes first.
Where's your laptop?
right here. Why?
okay, I'm about to send you something right now. Check this out.
Nate, what is this?
it's a web page I created with every single e-mail anyone's ever sent to gossip girl up until an hour ago.
how did you get this? - Jonathan.
remember when he and Eric hacked into "gossip girl"?
well, I asked if he could do it again.
okay, so what are you gonna do with it?
upload it to "the spectator" site.
if people know gossip girl's not confidential, they'll stop sending her tips, and without informants, she'll die a slow death, leaving "the spectator" new york's foremost scandal site.
we get new readers, and diana gets to keep her job. It's a win-win.
but for Diana. But think of everyone else you care about.
literally, everyone we know sent something in, including...
Oh, my god.
Nate, I just typed my name in, and literally, like, a thousand e-mails popped up.
Serena, you and I both wanna take down gossip girl. This will do it.
you cannot upload this to "the spectator."
I'm sorry. Is, uh, is everything okay?
Yeah, everything's fine.
all right.
who was that? - Just Louis.
look, Nate, you need to put your feelings for Diana aside and think of the ramifications for releasing this.
this would do way more harm than good.
but it's our smoking gun.
that's gonna shoot you, me, and all of our friends in the foot.
promise me you won't show this to anyone, especially Diana.
okay, fine, I won't show Diana.
what won't you show me?
so...
this is what my real life is like.
I'm... Sorry I lied to you, Max.
it's what I wanted to tell you when I bumped into you last week.
well, at least I finally get it.
all this time I was worried it was something I did that drove you away.
No! You were great. You've always been great.
look, Ivy- I- I'm sorry. I mean, Charlie.
my feelings haven't changed.
and now that I know why you did what you did, maybe we could give our relationship another chance.
Max, the truth is, after all this lying,
I just need some time alone to figure out my real self.
you know what I mean? - Not really, no.
I do love you.
and, um...
I wanna prove it to you.
you... Have always talked about moving out to Portl and to start your own restaurant.
that's your dream.
now I can help make that happen. - how?
since money isn't really an issue in my family, I could...
give you something to help you get started.
would $50, 000 be enough?
and then in a couple of months, I could come and join you.
you'd really do that for me?
I'd do anything for you.
you know, it's...Getting really late, and I have to get ready for my girlfriend's shower, so let's meet tomorrow before you go, and I can give you the money then.
okay? Sounds good? - Yeah.
it was very nice to meet you, missus...
Humphrey. You, too, Max. Will I be seeing you again?
I hope so.
that's a great photo. - Oh, thank you.
sadly, it's the only real family portrait that I have.
did you ever meet Charlie's mother Carol in Florida?
that's her mom? - Yeah.
you know, I-I think I will be seeing you again.
real soon. - Good.
Uh-oh, Charlie.
your mother of a lie is about to get you stuck in one big parent trap.
Nate, I can't believe it. This is exactly what we need.
I know, but we can't release it. - Why?
it's the answer to all our problems. I'm doing it.
Hey, look, I talked it over with Serena, and I just think she's right. It's too destructive to our friends.
destructive to your friends or to you?
I think you're just trying to save your ass so people don't see all the salacious things you've sent in to "gossip girl.
okay, honestly, I hadn't even thought of that.
I'm sure.
why don't we just see how many of your friends you've betrayed over the years?
you've never sent anything in to her?
guess not. Just not who I am.
you really are a good, honest man, aren't you?
I didn't think anyone like you exited anymore.
Oh, we're a very rare breed.
that's why when you find one of us, you gotta hold on real tight.
okay. You've convinced me.
so you're not gonna release it?
what about you and your job and "the spectator"?
I'll figure something out.
so... I've just got a few things to finish up here.
all right.
we need to talk.
Hi, Blair. You getting excited for tonight?
of course. We all know how much I love Souvlaki.
who told you? It was supposed to be a secret.
well, it's not. Is Serena there? She's not picking up her cell.
no, she's out getting the dessert for the party
Hawaiian shaved ice with all the best flavors, including everyone's favorite - Tutti frutti.
don't worry. I promise it will be a night that you never forget.
I'm sure about that.
isn't it a little mean, you and all of Blair's friends are messing with her about tonight?
well, it might be the only event in blair's entire life where she's not in control.
what about you?
how was it reconnecting with your old friend, or should I say old boyfriend?
do you plan to see him again?
no. He took off back to Florida.
I'm sorry that you had to find out about the "Ivy" thing like that.
I'm the one that's sorry
sorry your mother put you through that.
I hope you know you have family that cares about you, and you can always be your true self with us.
thank you.
come on, ladies. I didn't hire you to watch movies.
unless you wore my friend out already.
we tried, but he wouldn't stop complaining about some girl named serena and wanting to be a man of action.
so when he mentioned something about a shower, we were like,yeah,
but then he never came in to join us.
and by the time we got out, he was gone.
it's important to be careful about what you tell others.
what are you doing in here?
well, I was just going to check some e-mails until you finished getting dressed, mon ami.
I don't want you to get a big head about this, but perhaps you were right that my friends don't have quite my best interests at heart.
Why? What happened?
my shower.
doesn't sound like they're thinking of me at all.
you said I need to create some distance, but...
maybe the distance is already there.
how could it not be, when they say such terrible things behind your back?
I'm not talking about "gossip girl."
I hadn't realized what time it was.
we're gonna be late for our own shower.
come on. Let's go.
Dorota, we're leaving!
call down to Jimmy to get our car.
because sometimes your words can come back to haunt you.
it can happen to anybody, even me.
Louis, look, it's a Tiffany's party.
this isn't casual at all.
it's elegant, witty. It's...
it's you.
surprise!
Oh, my gosh. Oh, Serena!
this is above and beyond anything I ever dreamed of.
come on. You deserve it.
no freakin' way.
what is it? What's going on?
did somebody famous die?
what?
excuse me? Could I have everyone's attention, please?
I'm not usually one for speeches, but I have to say how lucky I am to have Blair Waldorf as my best friend.
I may be the maid of honor, but the true honor is just knowing you, b.
there is simply no one like her, no matter how hard some of you try.
congratulations to the beautiful bride.
you have become the strong, confident princess I always knew you would.
I love you so much and wish you and your prince nothing but happiness.
Cheers. - Cheers.
and one more thing.
we have a surprise for all the ladies tonight.
we'll be handing out boxes.
most of us will open ours to find it empty, but one lucky lady will have a diamond ring inside.
but you have to wait until I say so to open it.
enjoy.
Oh, thank you so much.
I hope you guys didn't mind my joke.
Oh, we didn't hear your speech. We've been too busy reading.
sorry.
okay. I'm
as you can tell by my casual attire, i'm-i'm crashing this party, but...
but it's only because I needed to stop whining, start becoming a man of action.
and a man of action wouldn't just do nothing. A man of action would, would show up and finally confront the person he's been meaning to have a conversation with for a very long time now.
I wouldn't expect you to understand what I'm saying.
who the hell are you people, anyway?
must be friends of the groom.
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late. I'm on my way over right now.
I thought I told you not to post the "gossip girl" sources web page.
I didn't.
well, somebody did, because there's a link to it on "the spectator" right now.
what?
Diana. I can't believe she'd do this to me.
to you? To all of us. Get her to take it down.
well, I can try, but it's probably all over the internet by now.
just please fix it.
I have to go do damage control before Blair's entire shower is ruined.
all right, I'm on it.
no photos, please.
I thought you saw the invitation.
privacy concerns.
I knew you couldn't stay away.
believe it or not, this is the last place I wanna be right now.
I'm not looking for trouble, just Dan Humphrey.
he's not very pleased with Serena right now, and in his inebriated state, i'm not sure what he'll do.
why don't you ask him?
I called you here because I saw a side of your grandson today I hadn't fully seen before.
and here I was, pretty sure that you've seen every side of him at this point.
he's not a boy anymore, William.
he's a man, and a good one at that, with a lot of integrity
so much, in fact, that he inspired me to summon you here and tell you that I was willing to abandon my war with gossip girl to start a new war
with you. - Is that so?
I was planning to tell you that I've ended up caring more about this paper and your grandson than you ever will.
and then someone went off to gossip girl.
and that someone wasn't you.
no. But I'm pretty sure nate won't believe me when I tell him that.
tell me what?
thank you for... Coming.
did you see what Blair wrote about us?
can you please tell me why people are not paying attention to me right now?
cause last I checked, this was supposed to be my night.
okay, everyone!
now would be a great time to stop whatever it is you're doing or looking at and open those Tiffany boxes!
Oh, my god!
I've never seen a ring like this before, never mind owned one.
which is why I should put it someplace safe.
thank you. Excuse me.
what are you doing here?
I know the truth. You're Ivy Dickens.
the real Charlie Rhodes is in Florida.
we cannot have this conversation in here.
what would possess you to tell gossip girl about my shrine to Nate?
or my excess hair issues?
or that time I went commando at communion?
okay, okay, okay, it's fine, it's fine. We're leaving now.
Oh, please, you've all said more slanderous things...Than John Galliano after a couple cocktails.
Dan. Oh, thank god. Someone who isn't mad at me.
that's not entirely true.
I need to know the real reason why you didn't invite me to this thing tonight.
cause I've been there for you when no one else was, and I refuse to believe that it's about my book.
I mean, I didn't write a bad word about you in the entire thing.
you, too?
doesn't anyone know what "not invited" means?
is everything okay?
not even close! Can you handle this?
all right. Okay.
please stay. Enjoy some food.
why did you do it, Serena? - Do what?
I saw the web page on your computer earlier.
are you trying to sabotage gossip girl just for the sake of your blog, or just destroy my night?
I created this night.
I did it all for you.
you know, Louis was right.
none of us here are really friends.
we just pretend to be so we can get stuff to talk about behind each other's backs.
B.i'll admit that I saw the web page, but I had nothing to do with it coming out.
I actually did everything I could to stop it, and I thought I succeeded.
well, if you didn't do it, then who did?
she and Nate and I are the only people that saw the site.
and Louis, but...
sorry, B.
must be hard to keep your head above water when your prince is causing everyone around you to drown.
can someone please explain to me what's going on here?
I mean, are you two working together?
have you been working together this whole time?
no, of course not.
Diana asked me to meet her here.
we just started talking when you came in.
I'm as much in the dark as you are.
Diana, is this true?
as a matter of fact, I did call your grandfather.
after the board told me I was gonna lose my job if I didn't do something fast, I thought...
maybe he'd want to invest.
and what about releasing all of gossip girl's sources on the web?
another desperate job-saving measure on my part.
after I told you how much it would hurt the people I care about.
you looked me in the eye and acted like you understood.
it isn't personal. - It is to me.
listen, Nate, I really care about
Diana, I think I'd like to invest after all, with one condition
your resignation letter goes to the board with my check.
I suppose that is what's best for "the spectator..."
and everyone else.
I'll start gathering my things.
come on, Ivy. Tell me the truth.
why does that woman think that she is your aunt?
why does she think that you are the nice young woman who played the queen of hearts in our local production of "Alice in Wonderland"?
Yeah, I found this in a box of your things.
look, I told you I'd get you the 50 grand.
I still can, and then we can go away together.
Ivy, everything you say is a lie.
but the money is real.
prove it.
consider it a down payment.
now please, just stay away from me and my family, and I'll get you the rest in the next couple of days.
okay, Ivy. I'll make myself scarce.
now go have fun with your family.
Really? You're really going to make me sit here on the stairs with you?
why don't you tell me why you antagonize Blair at her own wedding shower?
I was just-I was just trying to take some action, man, like you said, but it didn't work.
let's be clear.
I told you to get some ass, not make one of yourself.
it wasn't until I saw you confronting Blair that I realized I had it all wrong.
wait. Had what wrong?
you're in love with her.
I'm-I'm in- I'm in love...
with Blair?
no, no, no, no. No, no. I'm-i'm not...
I'm not in love...With Blair.
you can blame it on your tell-all novel or your perennial status as an outsider, but we both know blair doesn't care about any of that.
she follows her heart, and she chose Louis.
we both lost.
at least this time you have someone outside with you.
can we please get you home before someone sees me sitting here like this?
it was you who posted that page, wasn't it?
I was trying to show you what your friends are really like, once and for all.
you should have shown me at home.
you wanted this to happen.
it was more important to prove your point than our own shower.
you're not exactly innocent here.
I looked through some of those e-mails.
people say you and Chuck went to the theater while I was gone.
I only did that so I could prove to Chuck he hadn't changed, and in that case, you were actually right.
but I wasn't this time?
Beatrice sent out the blast about the paternity test, Louis.
well, okay. So that's one thing out of a million that
stop! Just...Stop.
do you see what we keep doing here?
all the fights and accusations - It isn't my friends. It's us.
I thought we were better people than this.
but the only ones caught in a cycle are us.
the cycle created by your world in New York.
I don't think I can do this anymore.
you see those people leaving?
why don't you join them?
I think I need time alone to think about the future of our relationship.
guess this shower's officially over, and it looks like B.'s the one throwing in the towel.
I couldn't believe you would think I of all people would release that information to the world.
do you have any idea how many things I've sent in to gossip girl over the years?
well, I've checked, and...
I sent twice as many as you.
I knew in my heart you didn't send it.
Louis just put all these ideas in my head that my friends were a destructive force.
but I think he's self-destructing, and he's taking our relationship down with him.
what are you gonna do about it?
I don't know.
but promise me you won't tell anyone he's the one who revealed gossip girl's sources.
I don't want everyone to hate him as much as I do in this moment.
of course, but can we talk about chuck for a minute?
he just had to find some excuse to crash the party tonight, didn't he?
what? He wasn't crashing. He was trying to stop Dan.
he was doing you a favor, believe it or not.
I thought you realized.
I just can't believe she'd go behind my back like that, you know?
I thought that...
you know what? Forget it. It doesn't matter what I thought.
well, I know this is hard, but this is a good lesson for you.
we're usually blinded by the people that we care about the most.
but here's the good news - With her leaving, the stink will be off the paper, which makes this a great investment opportunity.
even after tonight?
well, that's the best part.
I - I think her plan will actually work, which means all of "gossip girl's" readers will flock to us, or, rather, to you, mr. New editor-in-chief.
Congratulations. You've earned it.
Max. What are you doing here?
I'm sorry to surprise you. The doorman let me in.
well, usually when a guy stands a girl up, he doesn't show up at her house a week later.
unless he's coming to apologize and tell her that there has been a huge misunderstanding.
why didn't he at least call?
cause the girl deserved more than that.
and the guy would like the option to literally get down on his knees and beg her to give him a second chance.
if you would have stopped talking and just gotten on your knees,
I probably would have said yes, but.
I'll-i'll...
stop, please.
I forgive you. - You do?
so that means you're willing to give me another shot?
one more, but use it wisely.
I plan to.
you shouldn't be so upset.
whether you did it or not, you got what you wanted.
I just wish I didn't have to destroy my relationship with Nate to do it.
he's young. He'll get over it, and faster than if he found out the truth about you, too.
which, by the way, is the only reason I fell on my sword for you tonight.
Yeah, I figured. It's better this way.
you should be thankful you're getting out now before anyone discovered your secret.
remember one thing, William.
if they find out about me, they find out about you, too.
loyal readers, I'd like to apologize to all of you for the awful and embarrassing breach of security that happened tonight.
in bad times like this, you have many options.
Hello, Ivy.
looks like I'm gonna be staying in New York a little longer than I thought, plus I'd like to have a little more cash to play with while I'm here.
$50, 000 isn't gonna cut it.
how about we up it to...
$500, 000?
you can choose to go on the offensive and come out swinging...
or you can pack your bags and admit defeat...
or you can drink yourself into oblivion and hope it will all just go away.
whatever I choose to do to win back your trust, one thing is certain
this is not the end between us.
you shouldn't be here.
I know. But I had to come.
you've really been good this whole time, haven't you?
cause try as you might to fight it, you know you love me.
gossip girl here
your own and only source into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
you don't have to keep up the charade with humphrey for me any longer.
Louis and I are in a good place now.
she wants us to stay together until the wedding so louis doesn't suspect anything.
you're the one. I never wanna leave.
Oh, my god!
let him live. I promise I'll keep my vow to marry louis.
you can't base the rest of your life on one desperate moment.
I'm just cut out of your life without any explanation?
my new wedding date is in less than a month. I have to keep my priorities in order.
we were your priority. What happened, blair?
my dreams at night may not be about the man I'm going to marry.
I'm growing weak. I'm afraid I might break.
I know what is in blair waldorf's heart, and if you don't want this wedding to happen, together we can make sure it doesn't.
wakey, wakey, upper east siders.
gossip girl here, your one and only source into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
it seems like today is a big day for everyone, but none so much as me.
miss serena, it's finally here.
can you believe? So exciting.
I smile and cry at same time all morning, and not even wedding yet.
Where's blair?
she went to final fitting.
everyone else is coming here, including Mr. Lonely boy, for breakfast buffet.
get dressed and eat something. You need strength today.
once upon a time, princess b. Was a virgin queen, and her king was named archibald.
who would've thought in just five short years, she could turn that headband into a tiara for real?
I myself have come a long way, too.
but if you think I've spent all my recent downtime reflecting on who I am and what I've done in those same five years, let me assure you, that couldn't be further from the truth.
I was just planning my comeback.
so if I were you, i'd watch this space, because the new gossip girl is coming.
and what will my first post be?
all I can say is you should probably pray I won't be writing about you.
you'd think I wouldn't still have to do this sort of thing, but labels don't even have interns anymore.
I'm heading down to the east village before the wedding to put some of these up.
Oh, those are, uh, good luck, by the way. I wore them at my wedding.
I'm not sure what I'd need luck for, as I'm not the one getting married, but thank you.
well, you're in the wedding party. That's close enough.
what - Why are you in the wedding party again?
I did a favor for louis last week, so he asked me.
I figured it's better than sitting alone in a pew, right?
Oh, so no date tonight, or does the charade continue?
once blair and louis say "i do,
then serena and I can say "we don't" anymore and go back to being just friends.
no, but at the very least, this whole thing is probably a distraction from every "graduate" thoughts you might have.
well, with blair? No, any-any thoughts of her running off with me are- Are long gone.
if anyone's in danger of pulling a braddock, it's not me. It's...
I'm sorry, father. I don't play those sort of games anymore.
you'll need this to get past security today at the church.
shall we go over the plan again?
please.
father smythe's afternoon tea will be supplemented with sleeping pills instead of his usual sweetener.
when he is unable to perform the ceremony, her serene highness will have no choice but to ask me to step in.
during the service when I ask if anyone has any objections, that's where you come in.
and tell the world that only last week, i'd overheard her tell you she's still in love with me.
voila. In one fell swoop, you'll have saved blair from a loveless future, and I will have saved monaco from a thankless princess.
it is, as you people say, a... Win/win.
are you prepared?
more than you know.
water?
Oh, serena.
I am so nervous. Can you believe it?
she's marrying me.
I'm the luckiest man in the world.
don't worry, miss serena.
you find someone who loves you that way, too.
thank you for indulging me on this one more time.
I just wanna make sure I know all the steps.
is everything okay? You look...
surprised that we made it to this day? I am.
I was certain that your bride-to-be would humiliate our family in some way.
well... You don't have to worry anymore, because the brand-new positive image of the monegasque royal family is intact.
and blair is transformed into the most advantageous partner.
the press took to her in the wake of the unfortunate incident.
I couldn't have hoped for a more perfect arrangement.
I can't believe you're talking this way on the day of my wedding.
my relationship with blair is not a business deal.
but all relationships are business.
sometimes you are lucky, you have love as a bonus.
let us hope that you stay lucky.
I can't stop the feeing that I've forgotten something.
I've been over everything - The photographer, the caterer, the programs, all fine.
I just cannot put my finger on it.
well, I'm sure it's all right. I mean, you never forget anything.
it's one of your best, uh, and... Worst qualities.
as you know, the mother and father of the bride will share a dance this evening.
well, the father of the bride is right over there.
well, we're set then?
it's been a long time since we've danced.
I'm game if you are, as long as you don't show me up like you did the last time.
Serena, uh, louis' best man's flight has been delayed from rome.
would you like to just choose another partner from the present groomsmen just in case, or shall I just appoint one for you?
I've got this one covered.
Dan humphrey, my hero.
wonderful. Thank you.
wow, the dan I knew five years ago could barely box step, and now you're volunteering to dance?
well, I've gotten much better. I had to, after I met you.
you wouldn't have kept a partner with two left feet around for very long.
well, I liked your left feet.
well, don't worry. Once I put my dress shoes on, i'm sure I'll still step all over you.
Hey, she's here - The princess bride.
Oh, you're back early. Well, there are several matters to attend to.
first off, cnn is asking if you privately wish to be called "princess" or "mrs. Grimaldi.
I'm sorry. I just, uh, need my best friend for a moment.
go right ahead, Mrs. Grimaldi.
Mrs. Grimaldi"? What is going on? Is this happening?
well, it better be. Otherwise, all those commemorative plates are for nothing.
Oh, god. I'm gonna be married.
it's gonna be okay. It's gonna be more than okay.
it's gonna be the best day of your life.
are you sure nothing's gonna ruin it?
of course not. What could?
a true american princess"? "the next diana"?
don't these people do their research anymore?
maybe they just don't know her like you do.
or they've conveniently forgotten. Well, I haven't.
that bitch got me remanded to rehab, banished from bible camp, and abandoned in belarus, all for her own enjoyment.
if this is supposed to be her happiest day, then I can't wait to rain all over her parade.
I know you're capable of many things, but how do you expect to get into the wedding of the century?
by joining forces with the century's biggest wedding crasher.
I thought you were getting changed.
I did.
but the surplice?
Oh, no. I'm sorry. I feel sick.
may I use your restroom?
no, you may not, but you better find one you can and stay close to it for the rest of the day.
you may have a touch of food poisoning.
what did you do?
well, I'm just guessing...
but it's possible the water I've been continuously pouring for you all morning came from the tap at a bass resort bathroom in mexico.
you see, I can't allow you to destroy blair's wedding.
you think because I love her, I want her all to myself, but I'm not that man anymore.
I just want her to be happy.
and if marrying louis will do that for her, then that's what's going to happen.
I hope you can find a public restroom soon - One where the line isn't too long.
bless us, father. I have a feeling we're about to sin.
these black market babies got me through my morning sickness.
just don't take them with vodka. Learned the hard way.
thank you.
now who are you again?
the answer to your prayers.
from what I overheard, we both wanna take out the same wedding, which makes us kindred spirits, and now that you're down for the count, i'm more than happy to pick up where you left off.
and why should I trust you?
because clearly you need an expert.
you were trying to go after blair.
she's not the weak link. It's always the man.
and if you hand me that costume you're holding, i'll prove it to you.
how can you be so sure you can pull this off?
Jesus owes me one.
isn't the, uh, reception at the st. Regis?
Yeah, I'm clearing the rehearsal breakfast.
isn't the wedding hours away?
Yeah. I'm waiting on a friend. He's inside. He's a groomsman.
I'm, uh - Nate archibald. Yeah.
I worked your office christmas party, remember?
wow, we must have just missed each other. The place was so crowded in there, you know?
you signed my invoice at the end of the night.
well, I was really drunk by the end of the night.
and the day before, when we met to create the inventory list.
I'm... Sorry. I meet a lot of people
it's okay. You know, I can't really expect someone like you to remember someone like me, right?
if you'll excuse me...
who was that? - Someone I should have remembered.
maybe that's my issue - Paying too much attention to the wrong girls and not enough to the right ones.
well, if we're listing your issues, i'm not sure I'd start with that one.
I mean, here I am, solo at the wedding of the girl I spent half my life assuming I'd marry, and why?
because yet another one of my relationships turned out to be based on lies.
well, they haven't all been like that.
Yeah, maybe I should just admit that there's no such thing as an honest relationship and stop looking.
now that's crazy. Of course there is.
Hey, you know the world is really a mess when the most honest person we know is chuck bass. How'd that happen?
well, however it happened, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
we have to make sure that today is the one day he's not planning on honesty.
Hey, I was thinking the same thing.
in just three hours, everything is going to change.
well, not that much. I mean, you were already royalty, even if you titled yourself, and your kingdom was the steps to a museum, but now you have an entire country to rule because you're gonna be a real life princess.
how does it feel to have everything you ever wanted?
you tell me. I saw you with humphrey this morning.
so that fake connection sparked a real one?
not exactly.
Serena van der woodsen, you didn't tell him I said you could stop pretending?
I just thought, what's the harm in waiting till the wedding?
the harm is that you are falling further while he has little to no clue.
no one is falling anywhere.
I saw how you were looking at him this morning.
back in high school, he always had the same look in his eyes whenever you would walk by, like he was starving, and you were a tasting menu.
please.
just tell him already, before you mess everything up like you did last year when you pretended there was a choice to be made.
when even gossip girl knew there wasn't.
don't let the fear of how he's going to respond hold you back.
at the very least, say it out loud and be done with it.
may we come in? - yes.
I know I said once that you would never be as pretty as when you're young...
but you get prettier every day.
sweetie.
what is it? What's - What's wrong?
I don't know why I'm being like this.
it is just nerves. - Yeah.
no, I-i-i... I can't breathe.
this dress is cutting off my circulation.
maybe I should just take it off for a minute.
Yes, I'll take it off for a minute. Everything will be okay. Get it off!
no, no, sweetie. You just need to breathe.
you just need to breathe and-and have a drink of water and get some air.
I'll get the water. - I'll open a window.
it's going to be fine.
you look so beautiful.
she is a nervous wreck.
well, come on. What bride isn't on her wedding day?
I wasn't. - Yes, you were.
the quartet had to stall for 20 minutes until her xanax kicked in.
I have to run a last minute errand.
could you keep blair comfortable and calm until I get back?
of course. - Sure.
are you coming?
no, you're her father. You should go.
Milo?
with the nanny like you asked.
good. Then let's get cracking.
didn't see you this morning.
I slept in.
right. Well, uh... You have any plans today?
why don't we do you a favor and skip your ellipses?
monkey and I have a lovely day planned far from the upper east side.
the only person you have to worry about stopping blair's wedding is most likely standing right next to you.
Hello, humphrey. - Chuck.
Hey, man, I'm sorry. I just thought I'd, uh, you know...
I know what you thought, and you don't need to anymore.
if I'd been meant to stop the wedding, there would have been some sort of sign.
I have to go.
Mrs. Waldorf, what are you - Am I doing here?
I've been asking myself the same question the whole ride over.
can I have something to drink?
of course. Sparkling or still?
scotch.
it's my daughter's wedding day. Everything should be perfect.
hell, everything is, but that doesn't mean it's right.
when I married harold, I was so nervous.
I knew something was wrong, but I didn't know... What.
but when I married cyrus, I was very calm.
it was like everything was falling into place.
I don't want my daughter to have to wait for a second chance to be happy.
she should be happy the first time around.
wh-what are you saying?
all day long, I've had this feeling that I had forgotten something, and then I realized what it was.
you.
so... Are you coming to stop this thing or what?
Oh, look at that hat.
look at all of it - The flowers, the press, the people, the sheer enormity of it.
we must not really be married if this is what a wedding is supposed to be like.
of course we're married. Remember the park?
darling scott, sonic youth? - Georgina?
Oh, yes, and that. I'm trying to forget that part. Oh, let's find our seats.
why'd you need this?
what's the point of doing something scandalous if you don't record it?
there's gonna be a scandal?
after I seduce prince louis and blair catches us, there will be.
even if she knows I set this all up just to mess with her, once we upload that video to "gossip girl,
she'll have to postpone the wedding just to save face...
and that weird priest will take over from there.
th-there he is. Get behind that screen and hit "record.
come in.
hello. Uh, would you please tell the groom that,
his sister beatrice is waiting in his chambers to see him.
and in ten minutes, tell the bride the same thing.
make that five.
I had it changed so you and serena can walk down the aisle together.
much more romantic.
Oh, right. Yeah, sure. Thanks.
you don't have to keep pretending. Blair told me everything.
wh - What, she did?
Yes, and I'm delighted your feelings have become real.
okay, anyway, uh, thank you both from the bottom of my heart for covering for blair's conversion lessons.
you really are her best friends, which makes you mine, too.
excuse me. Um, apparently, my sister made a surprise reappearance.
sure.
prince louis, I had to see you.
I bet you did.
when rufus said he thought he saw you, I knew it must be true.
crashing one wedding wasn't enough for you?
I didn't crash. I was invited.
my invitation just got lost in the mail.
I do live in brooklyn now, after all. I mean, it's practically the falklands.
well, it's time for you to go. We've already alerted security, and I am glad I'm the one to throw you out myself.
now get your clothes on.
we'll be waiting just outside.
I'm sorry, babe.
Oh, we are so not done. I'll think of something.
how? They're on the other side of that door.
that one, yes, but not that one.
you should, like, totally donate that dress to the smithsonian.
mother, where have you been? Everyone's been looking for you.
don't be angry with me.
angry with you?
I'll just leave the two of you alone.
what are you doing here?
trust me, the last thing I wanted to do was show up today, but even your own mother seems to think we need to talk.
well, what I need is for you to - Don't marry him.
Chuck. - Don't marry him.
all those people out there are waiting for me.
Yes, they are, but they also want you to be happy, which you're not going to be if you go through with this.
tell me I'm wrong, and I'll leave.
you can't, because it should be us up there, and you know it.
it isn't that simple.
it's only that simple. You told me you loved me.
I know it was true. - It is.
of course I love you, chuck. I've always loved you.
I love you more and more every day, if it's even possible to love someone that much.
then get out of here with me right now.
we can go anywhere, just as long as we're together.
I know you can't understand, and I don't expect you to.
but even if I weren't with louis...
I couldn't be with you.
just know that not living with you is the hardest thing I've ever done.
but at least I have someone who loves me by my side.
you should find someone who loves you, too.
I have. She's standing right in front of me.
I know it sounds crazy, but I really am doing this for you.
Hey, b.,the photographer's ready.
it's okay, s.
Chuck was just coming to give me his blessing. Right?
that was so touching, really.
if I ever cried, i'd be moved to tears.
the best part is, I got it all for posterity.
now I can't help but wonder what would louis think if he heard how blair felt about you?
Oh, good. We found you.
don't worry. I was just leaving.
I just needed to leave my gift first. bye.
what's
b because
I
OK it is
I know excuse you're using to protect yourself from
from the messiness and uncertainty of a life with the man you really love.
I'll grow into loving louis.
I'm sure of it, and he'll never hurt me.
he won't have to. You're hurting yourself enough by marrying him.
B.,no matter what's happened between you and chuck, the two of you have always been connected.
everything that you've gone through keeps leading you back to each other, just like it does dan and me, and I know that it scares you and I know that it's a risk, but don't enter into a false life just because you're afraid to face your real one.
I am-i'm so sorry. I don't know what I was thinking.
no, it's okay. I understand why you brought chuck.
but despite everyone's protestations, i'm going through with this.
will you please tell everyone i'm ready to begin?
Chuck, wait.
don't worry. I'm leaving.
no, that's not what I was gonna say.
you need to know something - Something that if blair knew I was telling you, she'd probably never speak to me again.
listen, I don't want to alarm anyone, but there's been an emergency.
what? - Yeah. Blair needs you right away.
of course. I'm all hers.
come this way, please. Right this way.
excuse me.
Blair, my little turtle dove, what's the emergency?
I need another escort.
what? Did something happen? Are you hurt?
no, no. In fact, I feel perfect.
well, what's going on? You have an escort, blair - Your father.
Oh, cyrus. One father is not enough.
I need both of you to walk me down the aisle.
beautiful.
since we have a moment alone, would you mind telling me why everyone seems to think we aren't fake dating except me?
I think I may have just done something really bad.
What'd you do?
she's beautiful.
dearly beloved, we are gathered in the sight of god and in the face of this congregation to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony, which is commended in holy writ to be honorable among all men.
if any man can show any just cause why these two may not lawfully be joined together, let him now speak, or else hereafter forever hold his peace.
if no one else is going to say it, i guess I have to.
the person who should be objecting isn't chuck bass but the bride herself.
don't believe me? Watch this.
of course I love you, chuck. I've always loved you.
I love you more and more every day if it's even possible to love someone that much.
told you my first post was worth waiting for.
now what will my next one be?
I can't believe you did this.
good, because I didn't do it.
you really expect me to buy that?
it doesn't matter anymore. Gossip girl just showed everyone the truth.
it's all out.
the only part she didn't tell is this crazy idea that if you and I got together, something terrible would happen to me. That's right.
Serena told me about the pact. She, like me, cares about you and your future.
it's not my future i'm worried about.
Blair, you can't honestly believe
What?! Can't honestly believe that you were dead?
because you were, and you weren't coming back.
the only thing I knew I could do in that moment was to find a way to try and save your life, whatever it took.
even though I knew that once I did, you would never stop trying to ruin mine.
so... The truth is out.
but that doesn't mean i'm going anywhere with you.
what happened out there is awful.
but the part you didn't hear was that I chose you.
and I know this is humiliating, but if you wanna stay with me and go through with this, then I promise I will never humiliate you again.
excuse me, your highness. Your mother's requesting a word.
you caught me. I'm so scared.
What'd you do? - I didn't do anything.
Oh, you expect us to believe you're just an innocent bystander?
I never said I was innocent. I just like to watch.
and while I love our annual showdowns as much as anybody, if you're looking for someone to blame for what just happened, you've got the wrong girl.
come on, georgina.
sure, I made the video gossip girl played, but I didn't send it in.
I left my camera with chuck, thinking he'd show the prince, and they'd have a duel at dawn for what's left of blair's virtue, or maybe it's royal fisticuffs, whatever those are.
Chuck was in the back of the church. If he wanted to say something, he had his chance.
it's not like him to hide behind gossip girl.
no, it isn't, is it?
maybe you should ask yourselves which one of you had the most to gain from sending that video in.
I know from experience it's never who you'd think, so that rules out chuck.
maybe it was you, wanting to help his best friend get his girl back.
or maybe it was you, wanting to make sure your best friend didn't make a huge mistake.
or better still, how about you?
sending in that video would ruin both the wedding in chuck and blair's eyes, which is exactly what you want, since anybody with a pulse can see you're madly in love with her.
except for you.
anyway, whoever it was, the wedding's over now.
see you at the next shindig. Ta-ta.
Serena, dan, we need you right away.
I am sorry for the outburst. It won't happen again.
now if we can continue...
this time, after where you left off.
where you been all night, huh?
Oh, royal groomsmen duties are vast. Who knew?
did you talk to chuck?
no, I haven't even called.
I can't believe he did that.
I mean, after everything that happened last year, you would have thought he changed, but I guess he hasn't.
Yeah.
what are you guys talking about?
Oh, you know, just how love makes people do crazy things.
however poorly timed and inappropriate, what chuck did was a grand gesture.
maybe if I'd done one of those for the people I've cared about in my life,
I wouldn't be at this wedding alone.
excuse me for a second.
about before...
Oh, you mean what georgina said? No, forget that. She's-she's crazy.
no, no, I owe you an explanation.
all right, go ahead.
I'm sorry I lied and - And made you carry on our...
whatever it was longer than we had to.
you're sorry? Is that it? I mean, how about why you did it?
was it for publicity for your column, or did you just want, like, a date to your best friend's wedding? I can't figure it out.
that's because I haven't been honest with you.
and nate was right about grand gestures.
we all need to make them in our lives, so here's mine.
I love you, dan humphrey.
always have, always will.
Serena... - No, you don't have to respond right now.
I have some... Maid of honor things to do before blair and louis leave.
but I really hope we can talk later.
Lola. You're an actress in your second year at juilliard.
you're from miami.
you work these jobs to pay for school because your mother doesn't support you, and everyone talked about how great the office party was for weeks after, so thank you.
you're welcome. And, uh... I'm impressed.
well, maybe I'm not the kind of person you thought I was after all.
Oh, no, you probably still are, but for the first time, i'm actually a little interested in finding out.
ladies and gentlemen, please direct your attention to where prince louis frederic grimaldi and princess blair cornelia waldorf grimaldi will be sharing their last dance before departing on their honeymoon.
Oh, my god. Princess blair. That's the first time I've heard it.
And?
thank you for giving me another chance.
Oh, louis, the champagne hasn't gone to my head.
I'm too high for it to reach me.
we've made it, finally.
so we did.
what is it, mon cher? did I miss a step?
I promised my mother i'd wait until we were on the plane, but I can't any longer.
wait for what?
today with the eyes of the world on us,
I had no choice but to stand by your side after your public apology.
but that was it.
from this moment forward, there is nothing between us but a contract.
our marriage is all for show.
and you're going to put on the best damn show anyone ever has.
Oh, my god.
you'll smile for cameras, stand by my side, and wave like-like you don't have a care in the world.
but when we are alone, we'll be like strangers to one another, and it will stay that way until I say it's over.
but what about everything we've been through?
all those beautiful vows you said in front of god and everyone?
those can't just have stopped being true.
I didn't write them.
Dan did. And now they mean nothing to me.
but why? Why would you wanna be married to someone you don't love?
my mother told me love had nothing to do with marriage.
now I know she was right.
smile. Smile for the photographers.
weddings mark one of the largest transitions you can make in your life.
they are a new beginning, the next step in a person's evolution.
but evolving is a tricky thing.
you can't change without changing the world around you.
it's me. I made a horrible mistake.
I - I don't know what to do. Help me. Please.
and not everyone might see your transformation the same way you do.
Arthur, bring the car around. We need to get to the st. Regis fast.
but if you can make it through and truly be reborn, then maybe so can i.
Hey, have you seen dan? The coordinator wants photos of us dancing.
Yeah, I just saw him a few minutes ago. Hey, maybe check the other rooms.
okay.
so beginning today, the past is just a prologue.
it all starts from here.
Chuck, what are you doing here? If anyone sees you...
I need to apologize to blair. Where is she?
this was the only car with the keys in it.
that's fine. Just go.
Oh, and if you're wondering who caught the bouquet... I'll never tell.
you know you love me.
gossip Girl here -
your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
I love you, Dan Humphrey.
I really hope we can talk later.
Charlie! I'm sorry. I thought you were Charlotte Rhodes.
I am, yeah. People call me "Lola."And you are?
looking for a different Charlotte Rhodes.
if they ever found out the truth about the real Charlotte Rhodes, they would never forgive me.
I'm, uh... - Nate Archibald. Yeah.
I worked your office Christmas party, remember?
a true American princess? "The next Diana"?
if this is supposed to be her happiest day, then I can't wait to rain all over her parade.
why do you need this?
what's the point of doing something scandalous if you don't record it?
of course I love you, Chuck. I've always loved you.
I love you more and more every day, if it's even possible to love someone that much.
from this moment forward, there is nothing between us but a contract.
our marriage is all for show, and you're going to put on the best damn show anyone ever has.
this was the only car with the keys in it.
it's fine. Just go.
you know you love me...
X. O.X. O.Gossip girl.
everyone wants their wedding to be perfect.
but on the Upper East Side, perfect isn't good enough.
although some disasters can't be avoided.
excuse me. Have you seen the bride?
no. Sorry.
Rufus, mom, hey, do you guys know where Blair is?
no, I've not seen her since the newlyweds' last dance.
and where have you been, young lady?
your mother and I have been showing off our moves on the dance floor, and you and Dan should join us.
Oh, that sounds great, except I have to find Blair.
all right, suit yourself.
Eleanor, do you know where Blair is? I haven't been able to track her down.
I'm sure she and Louis are off having a private moment to let it all soak in before making their grand exit.
okay. - Serena?
Blair seems happy, doesn't she, with Louis?
of course. I mean, she--she loves Louis, and she's a princess now.
so you know, as soon as that soaks in, I'm sure she'll be beyond happy.
I hope so. That's all I want-- is for her to be happy.
I hope she knows that.
I'm sure she does.
enjoy.
thank you for coming. I'll tell Blair you said good-bye.
I was worried you left for your honeymoon already.
please tell me you know where Blair is.
I, uh, I believe she went to the powder room to freshen up.
okay, I-I won't keep her long. I know you guys have to leave soon.
okay.
but no matter how you might plan for perfection, there's always a hitch.
Blair confessing her love for Chuck at her own wedding is the best thing to happen to "Gossip Girl" in years.
so this is the big scandal you wanted?
not quite. Blair still married the twerp.
but she left the reception early. Something's wrong.
I just have to figure out what it is.
right now?
aren't you exhausted?
on the contrary. I've never felt more invigorated.
I can't find Blair anywhere. I checked every stall in the building.
did you check her room upstairs?
three times. I even had security look at the roof.
why would she be on the roof?
I don't know. Maybe I've seen "The Hangover" too many times.
it just-- it doesn't make sense.
why isn't she dancing with her dads or saying "good night"s with Louis?
I can't believe she had me keep her phone for her.
security at the Empire.
Hello? What?
it's... it's fine. I'll be right there.
it appears our question's been answered.
blair's at my place.
you must be pretty desperate to flirt with me by doing manual labor.
what? This isn't flirting.
I've always wanted to load a catering van.
one more thing to cross off my bucket list, right?
Nate, what are you doing down here?
I'm just lending a hand.
these things are heavier than you think.
pretty desperate, Nathaniel, although it looks worth it.
just so you know, Blair left without telling anyone and fled to the Empire.
we're heading over there now to find out what happened.
Arthur should be here by now. I told him to pull the car around back so nobody would see us leave.
you could be waiting a while.
the bride and groom are supposed to be leaving since there are photographers everywhere.
traffic is a mess out front.
luckily, this lets out onto a side street, so I can take the van out that way and avoid the mess.
look like we might need your van.
or maybe we can ask nicely for her to give us a ride?
please, it's-- it's for the bride.
she's run away from her own wedding without telling anyone, and we just need to find her and make sure she's okay.
I know that you don't know us -- Wait.
the princess is a runaway bride?
and you guys are going to look for her?
Yeah, I'm so in. I'll--I'll drive.
great. Thank you so much.
what? I'm worried about Blair, too.
thank you for coming.
Merci. - Merci beaucoup.
mother. - Keep smiling.
pretend that everything is fine.
Why? What's going on?
people wish to bid farewell to the happy couple, and I'm hearing that your bride is nowhere to be found.
maybe you should tell me what is going on.
I was so angry. I couldn't wait.
what did you tell her?
everything we discussed.
that after humiliating me, she will be my wife in name only.
what were you thinking?
the press is outside awaiting your departure, and there are hundreds of guests here.
this is why I told you to wait. Blair needs to be by your side this instant.
I fear she may have left.
the reception is winding down.
I will tell the press that the happy couple have slipped out back.
in the meantime, I'll find out if Eleanor knows where her daughter is.
prince Louis may not have been left at the altar, but the honeymoon appears to be over before it begins.
Hey, guys.
beautiful wedding, huh?
what have you done with Blair?
nothing, except tell the dumbest member of your security team that I was her.
sorry. I had to get your attention somehow.
this is Georgina Sparks. She's pretty much the worst person you'll ever meet, so just avoid eye contact at all times.
Georgina, what are you up to?
why do you always assume my motives are nefarious?
Well...look, I felt bad for filming the video, and I'm trying to make it right.
so when I saw Blair hightail it out of the reception without her frog prince, I knew I had to help.
cross my heart and hope to die.
here's hoping.
you saw Blair leave? Where was she going?
I don't know.
but if you want to find her, I was the last person to lay eyes on her, so you're going to need my help.
looks like everyone wants to know where the royal bride ran to, but will they find her in time?
I-I don't understand. The Dominican Republic?
Louis may not agree to a divorce here in the states, but I think I can get one there without his consent.
well, was researching divorce law part of your wedding prep?
because that should have been your first sign.
Elizabeth Taylor got her fourth divorce there.
there's some weird loophole in the law where you don't need the groom.
or maybe they just take bribes.
either way, I'll figure it out when I get there.
is this all because of Chuck?
I mean, I-I can't believe he sent that video in to "Gossip Girl.
no. I mean, I don't know. Maybe.
it's just the second that video came out, Louis transformed into a totally different person.
so the sooner I can free myself of him, the sooner I can get on with my life.
so... you wanna go to the Dominican Republic right now?
do you know a better way out of this?
the white zone is for loading...
you sure about this?
all right, then let's get you on the next flight to Santo Domingo.
you can run, and you can hide, but, Princess B.beware.
gossip Girl has eyes everywhere.
we may have an open seat on a connecting flight through Orlando.
let me just get my supervisor.
thank you.
what is the holdup, Humphrey? People are starting to stare.
all the direct flights are booked, but she's working on it, unless you'd prefer three connections.
whatever gets me out of here the fastest.
if someone were to recognize me and Louis figured out where I was going, he would try to stop me.
somehow I think that dragging you out of here kicking and screaming is exactly the kind of embarrassment you're trying to avoid, right?
no, I mean that he would try to stop me from getting a divorce.
the Grimaldis have a great deal of international influence.
one call to a diplomat in the Dominican Republic, and I can kiss my one shot at freedom good-bye.
Oh, my God. That's Blair Waldorf.
great. It is going to be Bieber fever in here in about one minute.
I mean, everyone is staring.
relax. They're staring at you because you're wearing a wedding dress.
Yeah. Right. You-you have a point.
Hey, hey! Yes, you.
you seem to have reasonably good taste.
what do you think about trading me this gorgeous, one-of-a-kind Vera Wang for the least offensive thing in your suitcase?
tell me you know who Vera Wang is, or keep walking.
wait a minute. Are you her? Are you the Princess of Monaco?
Oh, my God. Are you on your honeymoon?
Oh, my God! Oh, my God. The prince must be here. Where is he?
no, uh, I'm not her.
it's true. They just bear an uncanny resemblance to one another in every way.
Yeah. We--we are decoys, a-a distraction so that the real royal couple doesn't get mobbed by tabloid-obsessed losers like yourself.
no offense.
now that I get a better look, you're not nearly as pretty as Blair Waldorf.
and he's terrible.
you think I'd be insulted by someone with a Samsonite?
look, I just need to change, so lend me your credit card so I can go shopping while you get my ticket.
they do give credit to people from Brooklyn, right?
Hey, Serena, what's up?
Hey, sorry I disappeared from the reception.
I spilled red wine all over my dress, if you can believe it.
and I went home to change, and with traffic, it's just taking longer than I expected.
Yeah, no worries. I mean, I-I didn't even realize you'd left.
well, do you know where Blair is? I need to talk to her, but I have her phone, and I'm sure she's around there somewhere, right?
you know what? You just missed her. She--she left-- she left with Louis.
they left together?
Yeah. I mean, isn't that what they do at weddings?
anyway, they're gone. You know, they're gone.
they're, uh, probably on their honeymoon now.
you really should come back,'cause it's-- it's kinda... done here.
you sound weird.
no, I don't.
is this--is this about what I said to you earlier?
no, no, no, not at all. It's-- I mean, I'm just--I'm tired from all the dancing.
I should have given it a rest after "Funky Cold Medina."
look, I know that I said you don't have to say anything, but don't you have anything to say?
I do. I do, but I just-- I...gotta go to the bathroom. I mean, I'm walking in the men's room right now.
can I just--I'm gonna call you later, all right?
Dan says Blair left with Louis. Maybe we're overreacting.
you're not. Dan's lying. He's gotten pretty good at it, too.
Seriously? You think you stand out less in that?
anything "I heart New York" is the perfect camouflage.
a true new yorker wouldn't be caught dead in it.
she wouldn't give me your ticket without you here, but I got you a seat on the next flight.
it's like 36E or something like that.
coach?
Yeah, which is also the perfect camouflage.
it cost me a fortune since it's so last minute. You're welcome.
okay, then I just need your passport so we can issue the ticket.
Oh, my God. Her passport.
once again, Humphrey, I am one step ahead of you.
now... I know it's unorthodox, but this is an emergency, and I don't have my passport.
so I'm hoping that you will allow me to prove identity with this.
don't believe her!
she's a decoy. She told me so herself.
and check out how bad the prince is.
okay, once was enough.
look, I am Blair Waldorf. See?
okay, this is probably not the best way to go unnoticed.
great. Now I need a passport to prove I'm me?
if that stupid video had never come out, none of this would have happened!
I'll get Dorota to bring it to me. Give me your phone.
there's no way I'm believing Georgina over Dan, and Dan said that Blair left with Louis.
why do you automatically assume that I'm the one lying?
if your opinion actually mattered to me, I'd be insulted.
why are you still here? Don't you have a hole to crawl back into?
I want to help. Let's think of the possibilities.
ideas? Anyone? Who are you calling?
security. You overstayed your welcome when you showed up.
Hey, it's me.
can you send someone up to the penthouse?
Yeah, I have a situation.
no need for security. The jig is up.
you caught me. I have been lying.
I don't know what to say. I'm bored, and my DVR is empty.
listen, I can normally keep this up for hours, but I have a kid now, and his mommy and me group is way more fun to mess with than you guys. Bye.
wow, seriously? What is her problem?
Hey, I'm-- I'm sorry Blair wasn't here.
I know you were hoping she would run to you.
I should've known it wasn't her.
I need to make peace with the fact that it's over.
whoever released that video killed whatever chance I had with her.
your phone's ringing.
no, no, it's Blair's.
it's a text from Louis. That's weird if they're together.
where the hell are you? Get back here this instant.
thank you so much for continuing the night with me.
I have so much adrenaline, I can't possibly sleep.
it's too bad that the men in our lives are such bores.
Hey, I'm still here.
and I'm fairly certain that Lily and I weren't boring when we closed out the dance floor to "Moves Like Jagger."
let me tell you, even Jagger couldn't move like Jagger in these heels.
I hope you don't mind if I go change into some flats.
Oh, go right ahead. Shall I open a bottle?
what a wonderful reception. - Yes.
I only wish that Blair and Louis had not snuck out without saying good-bye.
I know. Perhaps they were overwhelmed with well-wishers.
I have an idea.
why don't we invite the newlyweds to stop by here before they leave for their honeymoon?
Louis has turned his cell phone off, but maybe you could reach Blair.
I doubt we could catch them.
well, how will you know until you try?
honestly, after the day that they have had,
I'm sure that they would prefer to be by themselves, and you know what? I'm kind of beat.
perhaps I should go home.
but Rufus has just opened a bottle of wine. It would be rude to leave now.
just one glass, at least.
and I've opened one of our favorites. After all, it is a special occasion.
ladies, please make yourself at home.
will you excuse me?
Hello? - Dad, it's me. Hey.
don't tell anyone I'm calling, and please don't freak out, but I'm at the airport right now with Blair.
she's going to the Dominican Republic to get a divorce.
what are you talking about?
you just gotta trust me.
she--she made a terrible mistake marrying Louis, and he's not at all who he seems, so she's gotta flee the country to make sure he doesn't find out where she is.
and--and you're going with her?
no, no, I'm just helping out, which is why I'm calling.
I need you to help make sure that Louis and his family don't know that she's trying to leave the city.
I mean, I'm sure they're already looking for her, and it's only a matter of time before they think to look here.
I'm with Sophie and Eleanor now.
they think she's with Louis.
Oh, good. Well, then keep it that way as long as possible.
I don't think Blair should be dragging you into this.
she needs me, dad.
if--if you could see how upset she is, you would understand.
please, please, just stall them.
all right, I trust you're doing the right thing.
I'll do what I can to help.
your battery's about to die.
I know. I just had to use a pay phone to ask my dad to buy us more time.
you told Rufus? That goody-goody will squeal the first chance he gets.
Oh, you trust Dorota?
I pay her to stay loyal. Rufus is always doing the right thing.
I'm sure he's already told my mother, which means everyone will instantly know that she knows.
she refuses to get Botox. Her face is an emoticon.
Louis won't find out, all right?
listen, I-I don't think that you fully comprehend the urgency of my situation.
you know what everyone says they did to Charlene Wittstock when she tried to run, and she was an Olympian.
okay, these people don't mess around.
I need to resolve this as quickly and as quietly as possible.
you'll be fine.
Rufus and Dorota are the only two people who know where we are, and I guarantee they won't tell a soul.
going somewhere?
since miss Blair gone on honeymoon, I take small trip myself.
with your employer's Vuitton. I don't think so.
I tell you nothing.
we'll see about that.
you remember when your husband took me on that small trip to Russia?
it's payback time.
careful, B.Loyalty's only worth so much until there's a bigger price on your head.
still no word from Blair?
no. I'm--I'm sure they're in the air by now, champagne toasting at 30, 000 feet as we speak.
do you honestly expect me to believe that?
excuse me?
Louis is in a limo downstairs, and Blair is nowhere to be found.
enough with the niceties. Tell me where she is.
I'm sorry. Where is my daughter?
I will not stand for the humiliation of my son being left on his wedding day.
if you cannot get Blair to return, then you will be required to fulfill the dowry that we so generously waived.
first of all, I thought my daughter was with your son.
and as for the dowry, it was waived because it's antiquated and outrageous.
you cannot force us to pay it.
it's all in the prenuptial agreement.
if she defaults on the marriage, the dowry can be reinstated.
so it is everyone's best interests for Blair to return.
how am I supposed to get Blair to return if I don't know where she is?
I'm sorry that took so long.
my new Loeffler Randalls had scuff marks on them, but they came right off.
so... what did I miss?
I was just about to tell everyone that the flower arrangements at the reception were so beautiful,
I thought we each should have one. So I called over to catering, and they're sending some over.
what a lovely idea.
well, they should be here any minute, so while we wait, who wants more wine?
thank you for your hospitality, but I'm afraid I must be going.
I was hoping to avoid this, but if you won't tell me where she is, I have other ways of finding out.
everything okay?
Oh, yeah, my boss wants me to help with something, but I'm off the clock, so he can find someone else.
Yeah, I'm so glad we're done. I'm just exhausted after all that work we had to do.
you know, I like a man who can make a good Martini but I could actually go for a cold beer right now.
do you have one, or is that too blue collar for you?
of course. Hold on.
Hello? Hi, mom.
no, that's because I'm at the library studying for a marketing exam.
no, the snowstorm's not that bad, I promise. It's, like, not even a foot.
Yeah. Can I call you back when I'm done?
okay. Bye.
who's that?
it's my boss again.
doesn't like to take no for an answer, I guess.
Yeah. Well, uh, hey, listen, I'm really sorry to do this, but I actually am exhausted after the wedding and Blair missing.
it's just kind of all hitting me right now, so...
okay. That's probably for the best.
maybe I'll do that job after all.
it was stupid of me to turn down the extra money.
I'll just put this back.
did you find anyone for that job?
we're now live on Manhattan's Upper East Side with prince Louis Grimaldi of Monaco.
what is it? Is Dorota here?
no, it's Louis. - Where?
as most of you know, Blair Waldorf and I were married in a ceremony earlier today.
mere hours after our "I dos..."
he must know I left Manhattan. I told you Rufus would rat me out.
Blair has now been reported a missing person.
at this time, we are doing everything we can to locate her, but we need your help.
Blair is an extraordinary woman, but after a recent personal tragedy, and the stress surrounding a wedding of this magnitude, she has not been herself.
if anyone sees her, please contact the authorities immediately.
I can't believe it. They went to the press.
I thought they wanted to avoid embarrassment.
no, this way, they can spin it so that I look crazy.
so why not go to the press yourself?
no, they still win.
they find me, they find a way to stop me.
we should go right now.
but where? We can't go back to the city.
the next flight out is tomorrow morning.
I'll find a hotel and text Dorota to meet us there.
is there a Four Seasons in Queens?
well, at least we know she hasn't fled the country.
Mr. Chuck.
I was only trying them on.
I was... so bored locked inside.
thankfully, miss Georgina a mother, and she--she not leave me without snacks.
Georgina did this to you?
she want to find miss Blair, but not to worry.
I tell her wrong place.
you know where Blair is?
Yes, miss Blair was at airport but now going to hotel waiting for me to bring passport.
something about Elizabeth Taylor.
Oh, my God. Blair wants a divorce.
that is my hope.
before I was locked in closet, Mr. Louis was calling and calling.
he said he want to find miss Blair and get her help she needs, which in romance novels, means locking her forever in tall tower.
I need to get miss Blair her passport so she can get away very fast.
we'll take it from here.
I told you it wouldn't be long.
follow that car.
sometimes when you want things done right, you have to rely on others to do them for you.
looks like we succeeded in finding Blair by using the press.
photos of her with the airport are surfacing all over the Internet.
where is she now?
she was seen leaving the airport 20 minutes ago.
that's the last account.
did Eleanor give you any information?
either she knows absolutely nothing or she is a talented liar.
either way, I have made it quite clear that they will pay if Blair continues this charade.
so what do we do now?
is it Blair? - No, it's from Gossip Girl.
I think the hotel clerk recognized me.
did you notice him staring?
you mean after you lectured him about their lack of spa amenities?
I can't believe that in just a few short hours,
I went from being a princess with a private jet and a palace to flying coach and hiding out in an airport hotel room with...Dan Humphrey.
what have I done to deserve this?
how about what I've done?
like be there for you completely and without question, and you still treat me like crap.
would it kill you to be just the tiniest bit appreciative?
in case you haven't noticed, I'm not exactly having fun either.
this was supposed to be the best day of my life, and now it's a big mess, and you don't need to be yelling at me on top of it!
if you haven't noticed, I've been helping you the entire time, and you're the one who's yelling!
all right, now I'm yelling, too, but you started it.
I hope someone yells at you on your big day so you know how it feels!
you already did!
you remember the day my book came out?
you blamed me for creating all your problems with Louis, and you never even read it.
I read the most important part-- the part that never happened.
look, all I've ever tried to do was be your friend, but friends don't treat each other the way you treat me, so if you really think you're better off without me, then why don't you try it out?
that's right. Go ahead and leave.
I didn't want you in the car, and I don't need you now.
fine. - Fine.
good-bye. - Bye!
that's not a Dorota knock.
she's a stickler for "Shave and a Haircut."
I'm so sorry, Eleanor. I'm sure that Blair will turn up soon.
I thought she'd be on her way to Bali by now.
I just wish that she felt that she could have turned to me if she was having second thoughts.
not knowing where she is or if she's okay-- that's the hardest part.
blair's fine. She's with Dan.
how long have you known this?
he called earlier. I'm sorry.
I wanted to tell you, but I promised Dan that I wouldn't say anything.
there are enormous consequences if she doesn't return.
I have to speak to her immediately.
where is she?
what are you guys doing here?
funny. We were just about to ask you the same thing.
Where's Blair?
I'm right here.
how did you find me? You didn't tell Louis, did you?
Dorota said you needed your passport.
the Dominican Republic? Really? Are you seriously doing this?
Louis doesn't care about me.
all he wants is to hold me hostage.
so you ran away with Humphrey, and he brought you here?
no. Well, I was just leaving.
wait, wait, wait. You knew we were looking for Blair. Why did you lie to us?
she told me not to tell anyone.
well, I didn't know you talked to her.
you do realize she falls under the term "anyone," right?
I'm not just anyone. I'm her best friend.
How--what--how am I the bad guy here? She dragged me into all this.
technically, I just wanted the car.
all right, well, now that your real friends are here to help you, I'm gonna leave.
Oh, oh, group shot. - No.
seriously, Georgina?
I'm outta here.
Serena, you found my camera.
and here I thought it and its touching movie of Blair and Chuck were gone for good.
well, at the very least,
I guess this solves who sent in that video to "Gossip Girl"
and ruined Blair's marriage.
my work here is done...
and documented.
thank you.
Lily, I wanted to tell you.
well, no need to apologize to me, but poor Eleanor.
she's probably upset because her daughter doesn't trust her as much as Dan trusts you.
let's just hope he continues to trust me after Eleanor shows up to drag Blair home.
well, telling her was the right thing to do.
I'm Lola from the catering company.
where do you want these? - Charlotte Rhodes?
uh, my husband and I were looking for my niece with the same name, remember?
Oh, yeah.
did you ever find her?
she was with her mother.
I can't believe you're delivering the flowers. Did you work the Grimaldi wedding?
Yeah. - Small world.
Yeah, it's just a part-time gig while I'm in school.
pays for the dorm. - Honey.
Yeah, let me take those. - Okay.
thank you.
I'm sorry to drag you here so late.
Oh, no, don't worry about it.
I get the overtime, and, actually, you saved me from something with this guy that I met at the wedding.
Oh, is everything okay?
Yeah. I broke two of my own rules
no dating party guests and no dating guys named Nate, Luke, or Troy.
usually lacrosse players, always trouble.
you don't... mean Nate Archibald?
Oh, yeah. You know him?
Yes, very well. He's actually a lovely young man.
maybe so. All I know is, as soon as I showed interest, suddenly he lost any he had.
it's fine. He's a "Nate.
I'm gonna head back and help the cleanup crew, - but it was nice seeing you again. - You, too.
it was you who sent in that video to "Gossip Girl"?
and set me up to take the fall?
Yeah. Yeah, fine. It was, um...
it was me who did it, but I did it for the two of you.
you ruined my wedding... for me?
I know you never believed in my pact, but this wasn't your choice to make.
I didn't do it to hurt you, Blair.
but you choosing to run away with Dan, knowing how I feel about him and not telling me any of it
that hurt, too.
I can charter a plane. We can be in the Dominican Republic by sunrise.
Blair will not be going anywhere with anyone but my son.
Uh-oh, B. Looks like you were right about their royal reach.
hope your plane ticket's refundable.
not even a day into your marriage, and already in breach of your prenuptial agreement with your illicit lover.
you don't know what you're talking about.
how did you find me? Did Rufus sell me out?
or is one of the buttons on my wedding dress actually a GPS locator?
I wouldn't put it past you people.
you are the princess of Monaco.
privacy is no longer an option.
but you should be used to that by now.
"gossip Girl" seems to know more about you than your own mother.
"gossip Girl" told you she was here?
I'm not going back with you.
I'm afraid you must.
my son awaits your return in the city, but if you refuse to join him, you and your family will quite literally pay the consequence.
or did you forget about the dowry?
a dowry? What century do you think this is?
if you don't recall, the price is pretty steep.
I imagine your mother will be forced to sell her company.
so it is up to you.
do you prefer to spend the next year as a princess...
or as a pauper?
I can find somewhere else to wait for my car.
no, Serena, hold on. Look.
I only lied to you to help Blair.
she was--she was panicked and running away from her wedding.
I was just trying to protect her from Louis.
well, if you were really trying to help, then you would have told me, because I could have helped her, too.
but you saw the chance to be her only savior, her knight in shining armor.
I won't apologize for helping a friend.
and apparently, you're not gonna apologize for lying to one, either.
are you really mad about Blair, or is this about us?
about what you said at the wedding, and because I haven't given you an answer yet?
you just did.
I'm sorry I blamed you for releasing that video.
it's understandable.
everyone knows I'm the obvious choice.
I'm just glad you know it wasn't me who did it, and now we can get out of here and start over.
don't worry.
I'll protect you from Louis and whatever his mother threatens to do.
if there's a dowry, I'll pay it.
I can't let you buy my freedom.
if it means getting rid of them, it's worth whatever the cost.
I'd do anything for you.
no. Not like this. I...
I made a promise, and I need to keep it.
to God?
you broke that promise when you left Louis.
and look, I'm still standing.
Chuck, I need you to let me handle this on my own.
what kind of chance do we have if our fresh start is you buying me from Louis?
when and if we end up together, it has to be as equals, with nothing over our heads.
that's the only shot we have.
I can't stand the thought of you with anyone else.
I don't care what it costs or where we have to go.
I just wanna be with you.
Louis won't lay a hand on me, I promise.
I'm sorry.
this is... how it has to be.
if you're looking for Serena, she's, uh, she's on her way back to the city.
I was looking for you.
I want to apologize.
everything you said was right.
I could never have survived this last month without you.
I also know you wrote those vows.
well, you know, Louis asked me to.
I-I just--I just tried to write down what I assumed he would love about you.
well, you did a great job.
it's pretty obvious you care way more about me than Louis.
as a friend, of course.
no, of course.
and I care about you, too, even if I have odd ways of showing it like, you know, bossing you around or making fun of your hair.
seriously, you should cut it already.
thank you for helping me.
and I really am sorry for maxing out your credit card and not reading your book.
well, listen, you have much bigger problems to deal with.
speaking of, what now?
I know what I have to do, but I just need to know that you'll be there for me.
always.
I was hoping I'd find you back here.
how did you... - Lily called me.
she said I might owe you an explanation for ending our date.
Oh, it wasn't a date, and you don't.
well, I think I do.
truth is, I have a history with girls who lie, and you seemed really honest and straightforward, which I liked.
but then I overhead a conversation with your mom, and, uh...
my mom.
where to begin?
well, to start, she's insanely overprotective.
she never wanted me to be an actress and said that New York would destroy my soul.
so...
I lie and tell her that I'm at Michigan State, Poli Sci major.
I love her, but I'm doing it to protect her... and myself.
I don't know.
family can be tricky.
no, I know. I just went through this huge thing with my grandfather and my cousin, and suddenly I'm left with no family at all, so...
I can relate.
although my cousin did try and have me killed, so maybe our situations are slightly different.
but I'm sorry. I should have asked you earlier.
how about a do-over?
well, if I'm being honest, um...
it's really fun to hear about your world, but I don't know if wanna be in it.
no, I understand.
so, uh, thank you for being honest.
there you are. I've been looking for your mother.
she isn't here.
well, I'll just have to tell you.
I know where Blair is, and I have no intention of sharing that information with any of the Grimaldis.
in fact, when I see her,
I am going to tell her I don't care what I have to sell.
I want her to stay as far away from you as possible.
in fact, for future reference, the Waldorfs do not give in to threats.
your family cannot control mine.
Yes, they can.
Louis... I'm ready to go on our honeymoon now.
my bags are in the car downstairs.
Blair, you do not have to do this. You do not have to go with him.
Yes, I do.
I heard what you said, mother, but I don't believe in saving myself and ruining our family at the same time.
it's just a year.
it's not that long, right?
sweetheart.
everything okay?
fine.
thank you for bringing that up...
and for everything else.
I meant what I said. Whatever you need, I'm here for you.
we need to go.
don't look so sad, B.
at least your prison is a palace.
wait. You're posting a video of Blair with Louis?
what about the photo of everyone at the airport hotel?
isn't that the scoop you were looking for?
no.
that photo has been rendered irrelevant due to the fact that Blair and Louis are together right now, leaving for their honeymoon.
but tomorrow's another day.
you forget I know who sent the video of Blair and Chuck to "Gossip Girl" in the first place.
but you can't reveal your source.
everyone would stop sending tips.
Oh, darling, of course they would, which is why I have something else planned.
my dear, sweet Philip.
since Gossip Girl abandoned her post after Blair's accident, it's been my civic duty to step in and continue her important work.
it's a dirty job, but someone's gotta do it.
the world needs Gossip Girl.
I'm gonna grab a water.
why did she choose him?
I would have done anything for her.
I know, but you shouldn't have sent that video in to "Gossip Girl."
don't you mean you shouldn't have?
come on, Chuck. You can stop pretending now.
I found the camera where you left it in the bridal chamber, and I put it in my purse.
I figured it was worth lying and saying that I did it if
if you two could be together again.
I wasn't lying.
I didn't do it.
but if--if you didn't do it, and I didn't, then who did?
some secrets I'll never tell.
but most secrets make for excellent blackmail material.
that's how it goes on the Upper East Side.
gossip Girl here -
your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
I love you, Dan Humphrey.
I really hope we can talk later.
Charlie! I'm sorry. I thought you were Charlotte Rhodes.
I am, yeah. People call me "Lola."And you are?
looking for a different Charlotte Rhodes.
if they ever found out the truth about the real Charlotte Rhodes, they would never forgive me.
I'm, uh... - Nate Archibald. Yeah.
I worked your office Christmas party, remember?
a true American princess? "The next Diana"?
if this is supposed to be her happiest day, then I can't wait to rain all over her parade.
why do you need this?
what's the point of doing something scandalous if you don't record it?
of course I love you, Chuck. I've always loved you.
I love you more and more every day, if it's even possible to love someone that much.
from this moment forward, there is nothing between us but a contract.
our marriage is all for show, and you're going to put on the best damn show anyone ever has.
this was the only car with the keys in it.
it's fine. Just go.
you know you love me...
X. O.X. O.Gossip girl.
everyone wants their wedding to be perfect.
but on the Upper East Side, perfect isn't good enough.
although some disasters can't be avoided.
excuse me. Have you seen the bride?
no. Sorry.
Rufus, mom, hey, do you guys know where Blair is?
no, I've not seen her since the newlyweds' last dance.
and where have you been, young lady?
your mother and I have been showing off our moves on the dance floor, and you and Dan should join us.
Oh, that sounds great, except I have to find Blair.
all right, suit yourself.
Eleanor, do you know where Blair is? I haven't been able to track her down.
I'm sure she and Louis are off having a private moment to let it all soak in before making their grand exit.
okay. - Serena?
Blair seems happy, doesn't she, with Louis?
of course. I mean, she--she loves Louis, and she's a princess now.
so you know, as soon as that soaks in, I'm sure she'll be beyond happy.
I hope so. That's all I want-- is for her to be happy.
I hope she knows that.
I'm sure she does.
enjoy.
thank you for coming. I'll tell Blair you said good-bye.
I was worried you left for your honeymoon already.
please tell me you know where Blair is.
I, uh, I believe she went to the powder room to freshen up.
okay, I-I won't keep her long. I know you guys have to leave soon.
okay.
but no matter how you might plan for perfection, there's always a hitch.
Blair confessing her love for Chuck at her own wedding is the best thing to happen to "Gossip Girl" in years.
so this is the big scandal you wanted?
not quite. Blair still married the twerp.
but she left the reception early. Something's wrong.
I just have to figure out what it is.
right now?
aren't you exhausted?
on the contrary. I've never felt more invigorated.
I can't find Blair anywhere. I checked every stall in the building.
did you check her room upstairs?
three times. I even had security look at the roof.
why would she be on the roof?
I don't know. Maybe I've seen "The Hangover" too many times.
it just-- it doesn't make sense.
why isn't she dancing with her dads or saying "good night"s with Louis?
I can't believe she had me keep her phone for her.
security at the Empire.
Hello? What?
it's... it's fine. I'll be right there.
it appears our question's been answered.
blair's at my place.
you must be pretty desperate to flirt with me by doing manual labor.
what? This isn't flirting.
I've always wanted to load a catering van.
one more thing to cross off my bucket list, right?
Nate, what are you doing down here?
I'm just lending a hand.
these things are heavier than you think.
pretty desperate, Nathaniel, although it looks worth it.
just so you know, Blair left without telling anyone and fled to the Empire.
we're heading over there now to find out what happened.
Arthur should be here by now. I told him to pull the car around back so nobody would see us leave.
you could be waiting a while.
the bride and groom are supposed to be leaving since there are photographers everywhere.
traffic is a mess out front.
luckily, this lets out onto a side street, so I can take the van out that way and avoid the mess.
look like we might need your van.
or maybe we can ask nicely for her to give us a ride?
please, it's-- it's for the bride.
she's run away from her own wedding without telling anyone, and we just need to find her and make sure she's okay.
I know that you don't know us -- Wait.
the princess is a runaway bride?
and you guys are going to look for her?
Yeah, I'm so in. I'll--I'll drive.
great. Thank you so much.
what? I'm worried about Blair, too.
thank you for coming.
Merci. - Merci beaucoup.
mother. - Keep smiling.
pretend that everything is fine.
Why? What's going on?
people wish to bid farewell to the happy couple, and I'm hearing that your bride is nowhere to be found.
maybe you should tell me what is going on.
I was so angry. I couldn't wait.
what did you tell her?
everything we discussed.
that after humiliating me, she will be my wife in name only.
what were you thinking?
the press is outside awaiting your departure, and there are hundreds of guests here.
this is why I told you to wait. Blair needs to be by your side this instant.
I fear she may have left.
the reception is winding down.
I will tell the press that the happy couple have slipped out back.
in the meantime, I'll find out if Eleanor knows where her daughter is.
prince Louis may not have been left at the altar, but the honeymoon appears to be over before it begins.
Hey, guys.
beautiful wedding, huh?
what have you done with Blair?
nothing, except tell the dumbest member of your security team that I was her.
sorry. I had to get your attention somehow.
this is Georgina Sparks. She's pretty much the worst person you'll ever meet, so just avoid eye contact at all times.
Georgina, what are you up to?
why do you always assume my motives are nefarious?
Well...look, I felt bad for filming the video, and I'm trying to make it right.
so when I saw Blair hightail it out of the reception without her frog prince, I knew I had to help.
cross my heart and hope to die.
here's hoping.
you saw Blair leave? Where was she going?
I don't know.
but if you want to find her, I was the last person to lay eyes on her, so you're going to need my help.
looks like everyone wants to know where the royal bride ran to, but will they find her in time?
I-I don't understand. The Dominican Republic?
Louis may not agree to a divorce here in the states, but I think I can get one there without his consent.
well, was researching divorce law part of your wedding prep?
because that should have been your first sign.
Elizabeth Taylor got her fourth divorce there.
there's some weird loophole in the law where you don't need the groom.
or maybe they just take bribes.
either way, I'll figure it out when I get there.
is this all because of Chuck?
I mean, I-I can't believe he sent that video in to "Gossip Girl.
no. I mean, I don't know. Maybe.
it's just the second that video came out, Louis transformed into a totally different person.
so the sooner I can free myself of him, the sooner I can get on with my life.
so... you wanna go to the Dominican Republic right now?
do you know a better way out of this?
the white zone is for loading...
you sure about this?
all right, then let's get you on the next flight to Santo Domingo.
you can run, and you can hide, but, Princess B.beware.
gossip Girl has eyes everywhere.
we may have an open seat on a connecting flight through Orlando.
let me just get my supervisor.
thank you.
what is the holdup, Humphrey? People are starting to stare.
all the direct flights are booked, but she's working on it, unless you'd prefer three connections.
whatever gets me out of here the fastest.
if someone were to recognize me and Louis figured out where I was going, he would try to stop me.
somehow I think that dragging you out of here kicking and screaming is exactly the kind of embarrassment you're trying to avoid, right?
no, I mean that he would try to stop me from getting a divorce.
the Grimaldis have a great deal of international influence.
one call to a diplomat in the Dominican Republic, and I can kiss my one shot at freedom good-bye.
Oh, my God. That's Blair Waldorf.
great. It is going to be Bieber fever in here in about one minute.
I mean, everyone is staring.
relax. They're staring at you because you're wearing a wedding dress.
Yeah. Right. You-you have a point.
Hey, hey! Yes, you.
you seem to have reasonably good taste.
what do you think about trading me this gorgeous, one-of-a-kind Vera Wang for the least offensive thing in your suitcase?
tell me you know who Vera Wang is, or keep walking.
wait a minute. Are you her? Are you the Princess of Monaco?
Oh, my God. Are you on your honeymoon?
Oh, my God! Oh, my God. The prince must be here. Where is he?
no, uh, I'm not her.
it's true. They just bear an uncanny resemblance to one another in every way.
Yeah. We--we are decoys, a-a distraction so that the real royal couple doesn't get mobbed by tabloid-obsessed losers like yourself.
no offense.
now that I get a better look, you're not nearly as pretty as Blair Waldorf.
and he's terrible.
you think I'd be insulted by someone with a Samsonite?
look, I just need to change, so lend me your credit card so I can go shopping while you get my ticket.
they do give credit to people from Brooklyn, right?
Hey, Serena, what's up?
Hey, sorry I disappeared from the reception.
I spilled red wine all over my dress, if you can believe it.
and I went home to change, and with traffic, it's just taking longer than I expected.
Yeah, no worries. I mean, I-I didn't even realize you'd left.
well, do you know where Blair is? I need to talk to her, but I have her phone, and I'm sure she's around there somewhere, right?
you know what? You just missed her. She--she left-- she left with Louis.
they left together?
Yeah. I mean, isn't that what they do at weddings?
anyway, they're gone. You know, they're gone.
they're, uh, probably on their honeymoon now.
you really should come back,'cause it's-- it's kinda... done here.
you sound weird.
no, I don't.
is this--is this about what I said to you earlier?
no, no, no, not at all. It's-- I mean, I'm just--I'm tired from all the dancing.
I should have given it a rest after "Funky Cold Medina."
look, I know that I said you don't have to say anything, but don't you have anything to say?
I do. I do, but I just-- I...gotta go to the bathroom. I mean, I'm walking in the men's room right now.
can I just--I'm gonna call you later, all right?
Dan says Blair left with Louis. Maybe we're overreacting.
you're not. Dan's lying. He's gotten pretty good at it, too.
Seriously? You think you stand out less in that?
anything "I heart New York" is the perfect camouflage.
a true new yorker wouldn't be caught dead in it.
she wouldn't give me your ticket without you here, but I got you a seat on the next flight.
it's like 36E or something like that.
coach?
Yeah, which is also the perfect camouflage.
it cost me a fortune since it's so last minute. You're welcome.
okay, then I just need your passport so we can issue the ticket.
Oh, my God. Her passport.
once again, Humphrey, I am one step ahead of you.
now... I know it's unorthodox, but this is an emergency, and I don't have my passport.
so I'm hoping that you will allow me to prove identity with this.
don't believe her!
she's a decoy. She told me so herself.
and check out how bad the prince is.
okay, once was enough.
look, I am Blair Waldorf. See?
okay, this is probably not the best way to go unnoticed.
great. Now I need a passport to prove I'm me?
if that stupid video had never come out, none of this would have happened!
I'll get Dorota to bring it to me. Give me your phone.
there's no way I'm believing Georgina over Dan, and Dan said that Blair left with Louis.
why do you automatically assume that I'm the one lying?
if your opinion actually mattered to me, I'd be insulted.
why are you still here? Don't you have a hole to crawl back into?
I want to help. Let's think of the possibilities.
ideas? Anyone? Who are you calling?
security. You overstayed your welcome when you showed up.
Hey, it's me.
can you send someone up to the penthouse?
Yeah, I have a situation.
no need for security. The jig is up.
you caught me. I have been lying.
I don't know what to say. I'm bored, and my DVR is empty.
listen, I can normally keep this up for hours, but I have a kid now, and his mommy and me group is way more fun to mess with than you guys. Bye.
wow, seriously? What is her problem?
Hey, I'm-- I'm sorry Blair wasn't here.
I know you were hoping she would run to you.
I should've known it wasn't her.
I need to make peace with the fact that it's over.
whoever released that video killed whatever chance I had with her.
your phone's ringing.
no, no, it's Blair's.
it's a text from Louis. That's weird if they're together.
where the hell are you? Get back here this instant.
thank you so much for continuing the night with me.
I have so much adrenaline, I can't possibly sleep.
it's too bad that the men in our lives are such bores.
Hey, I'm still here.
and I'm fairly certain that Lily and I weren't boring when we closed out the dance floor to "Moves Like Jagger."
let me tell you, even Jagger couldn't move like Jagger in these heels.
I hope you don't mind if I go change into some flats.
Oh, go right ahead. Shall I open a bottle?
what a wonderful reception. - Yes.
I only wish that Blair and Louis had not snuck out without saying good-bye.
I know. Perhaps they were overwhelmed with well-wishers.
I have an idea.
why don't we invite the newlyweds to stop by here before they leave for their honeymoon?
Louis has turned his cell phone off, but maybe you could reach Blair.
I doubt we could catch them.
well, how will you know until you try?
honestly, after the day that they have had,
I'm sure that they would prefer to be by themselves, and you know what? I'm kind of beat.
perhaps I should go home.
but Rufus has just opened a bottle of wine. It would be rude to leave now.
just one glass, at least.
and I've opened one of our favorites. After all, it is a special occasion.
ladies, please make yourself at home.
will you excuse me?
Hello? - Dad, it's me. Hey.
don't tell anyone I'm calling, and please don't freak out, but I'm at the airport right now with Blair.
she's going to the Dominican Republic to get a divorce.
what are you talking about?
you just gotta trust me.
she--she made a terrible mistake marrying Louis, and he's not at all who he seems, so she's gotta flee the country to make sure he doesn't find out where she is.
and--and you're going with her?
no, no, I'm just helping out, which is why I'm calling.
I need you to help make sure that Louis and his family don't know that she's trying to leave the city.
I mean, I'm sure they're already looking for her, and it's only a matter of time before they think to look here.
I'm with Sophie and Eleanor now.
they think she's with Louis.
Oh, good. Well, then keep it that way as long as possible.
I don't think Blair should be dragging you into this.
she needs me, dad.
if--if you could see how upset she is, you would understand.
please, please, just stall them.
all right, I trust you're doing the right thing.
I'll do what I can to help.
your battery's about to die.
I know. I just had to use a pay phone to ask my dad to buy us more time.
you told Rufus? That goody-goody will squeal the first chance he gets.
Oh, you trust Dorota?
I pay her to stay loyal. Rufus is always doing the right thing.
I'm sure he's already told my mother, which means everyone will instantly know that she knows.
she refuses to get Botox. Her face is an emoticon.
Louis won't find out, all right?
listen, I-I don't think that you fully comprehend the urgency of my situation.
you know what everyone says they did to Charlene Wittstock when she tried to run, and she was an Olympian.
okay, these people don't mess around.
I need to resolve this as quickly and as quietly as possible.
you'll be fine.
Rufus and Dorota are the only two people who know where we are, and I guarantee they won't tell a soul.
going somewhere?
since miss Blair gone on honeymoon, I take small trip myself.
with your employer's Vuitton. I don't think so.
I tell you nothing.
we'll see about that.
you remember when your husband took me on that small trip to Russia?
it's payback time.
careful, B.Loyalty's only worth so much until there's a bigger price on your head.
still no word from Blair?
no. I'm--I'm sure they're in the air by now, champagne toasting at 30, 000 feet as we speak.
do you honestly expect me to believe that?
excuse me?
Louis is in a limo downstairs, and Blair is nowhere to be found.
enough with the niceties. Tell me where she is.
I'm sorry. Where is my daughter?
I will not stand for the humiliation of my son being left on his wedding day.
if you cannot get Blair to return, then you will be required to fulfill the dowry that we so generously waived.
first of all, I thought my daughter was with your son.
and as for the dowry, it was waived because it's antiquated and outrageous.
you cannot force us to pay it.
it's all in the prenuptial agreement.
if she defaults on the marriage, the dowry can be reinstated.
so it is everyone's best interests for Blair to return.
how am I supposed to get Blair to return if I don't know where she is?
I'm sorry that took so long.
my new Loeffler Randalls had scuff marks on them, but they came right off.
so... what did I miss?
I was just about to tell everyone that the flower arrangements at the reception were so beautiful,
I thought we each should have one. So I called over to catering, and they're sending some over.
what a lovely idea.
well, they should be here any minute, so while we wait, who wants more wine?
thank you for your hospitality, but I'm afraid I must be going.
I was hoping to avoid this, but if you won't tell me where she is, I have other ways of finding out.
everything okay?
Oh, yeah, my boss wants me to help with something, but I'm off the clock, so he can find someone else.
Yeah, I'm so glad we're done. I'm just exhausted after all that work we had to do.
you know, I like a man who can make a good Martini but I could actually go for a cold beer right now.
do you have one, or is that too blue collar for you?
of course. Hold on.
Hello? Hi, mom.
no, that's because I'm at the library studying for a marketing exam.
no, the snowstorm's not that bad, I promise. It's, like, not even a foot.
Yeah. Can I call you back when I'm done?
okay. Bye.
who's that?
it's my boss again.
doesn't like to take no for an answer, I guess.
Yeah. Well, uh, hey, listen, I'm really sorry to do this, but I actually am exhausted after the wedding and Blair missing.
it's just kind of all hitting me right now, so...
okay. That's probably for the best.
maybe I'll do that job after all.
it was stupid of me to turn down the extra money.
I'll just put this back.
did you find anyone for that job?
we're now live on Manhattan's Upper East Side with prince Louis Grimaldi of Monaco.
what is it? Is Dorota here?
no, it's Louis. - Where?
as most of you know, Blair Waldorf and I were married in a ceremony earlier today.
mere hours after our "I dos..."
he must know I left Manhattan. I told you Rufus would rat me out.
Blair has now been reported a missing person.
at this time, we are doing everything we can to locate her, but we need your help.
Blair is an extraordinary woman, but after a recent personal tragedy, and the stress surrounding a wedding of this magnitude, she has not been herself.
if anyone sees her, please contact the authorities immediately.
I can't believe it. They went to the press.
I thought they wanted to avoid embarrassment.
no, this way, they can spin it so that I look crazy.
so why not go to the press yourself?
no, they still win.
they find me, they find a way to stop me.
we should go right now.
but where? We can't go back to the city.
the next flight out is tomorrow morning.
I'll find a hotel and text Dorota to meet us there.
is there a Four Seasons in Queens?
well, at least we know she hasn't fled the country.
Mr. Chuck.
I was only trying them on.
I was... so bored locked inside.
thankfully, miss Georgina a mother, and she--she not leave me without snacks.
Georgina did this to you?
she want to find miss Blair, but not to worry.
I tell her wrong place.
you know where Blair is?
Yes, miss Blair was at airport but now going to hotel waiting for me to bring passport.
something about Elizabeth Taylor.
Oh, my God. Blair wants a divorce.
that is my hope.
before I was locked in closet, Mr. Louis was calling and calling.
he said he want to find miss Blair and get her help she needs, which in romance novels, means locking her forever in tall tower.
I need to get miss Blair her passport so she can get away very fast.
we'll take it from here.
I told you it wouldn't be long.
follow that car.
sometimes when you want things done right, you have to rely on others to do them for you.
looks like we succeeded in finding Blair by using the press.
photos of her with the airport are surfacing all over the Internet.
where is she now?
she was seen leaving the airport 20 minutes ago.
that's the last account.
did Eleanor give you any information?
either she knows absolutely nothing or she is a talented liar.
either way, I have made it quite clear that they will pay if Blair continues this charade.
so what do we do now?
is it Blair? - No, it's from Gossip Girl.
I think the hotel clerk recognized me.
did you notice him staring?
you mean after you lectured him about their lack of spa amenities?
I can't believe that in just a few short hours,
I went from being a princess with a private jet and a palace to flying coach and hiding out in an airport hotel room with...Dan Humphrey.
what have I done to deserve this?
how about what I've done?
like be there for you completely and without question, and you still treat me like crap.
would it kill you to be just the tiniest bit appreciative?
in case you haven't noticed, I'm not exactly having fun either.
this was supposed to be the best day of my life, and now it's a big mess, and you don't need to be yelling at me on top of it!
if you haven't noticed, I've been helping you the entire time, and you're the one who's yelling!
all right, now I'm yelling, too, but you started it.
I hope someone yells at you on your big day so you know how it feels!
you already did!
you remember the day my book came out?
you blamed me for creating all your problems with Louis, and you never even read it.
I read the most important part-- the part that never happened.
look, all I've ever tried to do was be your friend, but friends don't treat each other the way you treat me, so if you really think you're better off without me, then why don't you try it out?
that's right. Go ahead and leave.
I didn't want you in the car, and I don't need you now.
fine. - Fine.
good-bye. - Bye!
that's not a Dorota knock.
she's a stickler for "Shave and a Haircut."
I'm so sorry, Eleanor. I'm sure that Blair will turn up soon.
I thought she'd be on her way to Bali by now.
I just wish that she felt that she could have turned to me if she was having second thoughts.
not knowing where she is or if she's okay-- that's the hardest part.
blair's fine. She's with Dan.
how long have you known this?
he called earlier. I'm sorry.
I wanted to tell you, but I promised Dan that I wouldn't say anything.
there are enormous consequences if she doesn't return.
I have to speak to her immediately.
where is she?
what are you guys doing here?
funny. We were just about to ask you the same thing.
Where's Blair?
I'm right here.
how did you find me? You didn't tell Louis, did you?
Dorota said you needed your passport.
the Dominican Republic? Really? Are you seriously doing this?
Louis doesn't care about me.
all he wants is to hold me hostage.
so you ran away with Humphrey, and he brought you here?
no. Well, I was just leaving.
wait, wait, wait. You knew we were looking for Blair. Why did you lie to us?
she told me not to tell anyone.
well, I didn't know you talked to her.
you do realize she falls under the term "anyone," right?
I'm not just anyone. I'm her best friend.
How--what--how am I the bad guy here? She dragged me into all this.
technically, I just wanted the car.
all right, well, now that your real friends are here to help you, I'm gonna leave.
Oh, oh, group shot. - No.
seriously, Georgina?
I'm outta here.
Serena, you found my camera.
and here I thought it and its touching movie of Blair and Chuck were gone for good.
well, at the very least,
I guess this solves who sent in that video to "Gossip Girl"
and ruined Blair's marriage.
my work here is done...
and documented.
thank you.
Lily, I wanted to tell you.
well, no need to apologize to me, but poor Eleanor.
she's probably upset because her daughter doesn't trust her as much as Dan trusts you.
let's just hope he continues to trust me after Eleanor shows up to drag Blair home.
well, telling her was the right thing to do.
I'm Lola from the catering company.
where do you want these? - Charlotte Rhodes?
uh, my husband and I were looking for my niece with the same name, remember?
Oh, yeah.
did you ever find her?
she was with her mother.
I can't believe you're delivering the flowers. Did you work the Grimaldi wedding?
Yeah. - Small world.
Yeah, it's just a part-time gig while I'm in school.
pays for the dorm. - Honey.
Yeah, let me take those. - Okay.
thank you.
I'm sorry to drag you here so late.
Oh, no, don't worry about it.
I get the overtime, and, actually, you saved me from something with this guy that I met at the wedding.
Oh, is everything okay?
Yeah. I broke two of my own rules
no dating party guests and no dating guys named Nate, Luke, or Troy.
usually lacrosse players, always trouble.
you don't... mean Nate Archibald?
Oh, yeah. You know him?
Yes, very well. He's actually a lovely young man.
maybe so. All I know is, as soon as I showed interest, suddenly he lost any he had.
it's fine. He's a "Nate.
I'm gonna head back and help the cleanup crew, - but it was nice seeing you again. - You, too.
it was you who sent in that video to "Gossip Girl"?
and set me up to take the fall?
Yeah. Yeah, fine. It was, um...
it was me who did it, but I did it for the two of you.
you ruined my wedding... for me?
I know you never believed in my pact, but this wasn't your choice to make.
I didn't do it to hurt you, Blair.
but you choosing to run away with Dan, knowing how I feel about him and not telling me any of it
that hurt, too.
I can charter a plane. We can be in the Dominican Republic by sunrise.
Blair will not be going anywhere with anyone but my son.
Uh-oh, B. Looks like you were right about their royal reach.
hope your plane ticket's refundable.
not even a day into your marriage, and already in breach of your prenuptial agreement with your illicit lover.
you don't know what you're talking about.
how did you find me? Did Rufus sell me out?
or is one of the buttons on my wedding dress actually a GPS locator?
I wouldn't put it past you people.
you are the princess of Monaco.
privacy is no longer an option.
but you should be used to that by now.
"gossip Girl" seems to know more about you than your own mother.
"gossip Girl" told you she was here?
I'm not going back with you.
I'm afraid you must.
my son awaits your return in the city, but if you refuse to join him, you and your family will quite literally pay the consequence.
or did you forget about the dowry?
a dowry? What century do you think this is?
if you don't recall, the price is pretty steep.
I imagine your mother will be forced to sell her company.
so it is up to you.
do you prefer to spend the next year as a princess...
or as a pauper?
I can find somewhere else to wait for my car.
no, Serena, hold on. Look.
I only lied to you to help Blair.
she was--she was panicked and running away from her wedding.
I was just trying to protect her from Louis.
well, if you were really trying to help, then you would have told me, because I could have helped her, too.
but you saw the chance to be her only savior, her knight in shining armor.
I won't apologize for helping a friend.
and apparently, you're not gonna apologize for lying to one, either.
are you really mad about Blair, or is this about us?
about what you said at the wedding, and because I haven't given you an answer yet?
you just did.
I'm sorry I blamed you for releasing that video.
it's understandable.
everyone knows I'm the obvious choice.
I'm just glad you know it wasn't me who did it, and now we can get out of here and start over.
don't worry.
I'll protect you from Louis and whatever his mother threatens to do.
if there's a dowry, I'll pay it.
I can't let you buy my freedom.
if it means getting rid of them, it's worth whatever the cost.
I'd do anything for you.
no. Not like this. I...
I made a promise, and I need to keep it.
to God?
you broke that promise when you left Louis.
and look, I'm still standing.
Chuck, I need you to let me handle this on my own.
what kind of chance do we have if our fresh start is you buying me from Louis?
when and if we end up together, it has to be as equals, with nothing over our heads.
that's the only shot we have.
I can't stand the thought of you with anyone else.
I don't care what it costs or where we have to go.
I just wanna be with you.
Louis won't lay a hand on me, I promise.
I'm sorry.
this is... how it has to be.
if you're looking for Serena, she's, uh, she's on her way back to the city.
I was looking for you.
I want to apologize.
everything you said was right.
I could never have survived this last month without you.
I also know you wrote those vows.
well, you know, Louis asked me to.
I-I just--I just tried to write down what I assumed he would love about you.
well, you did a great job.
it's pretty obvious you care way more about me than Louis.
as a friend, of course.
no, of course.
and I care about you, too, even if I have odd ways of showing it like, you know, bossing you around or making fun of your hair.
seriously, you should cut it already.
thank you for helping me.
and I really am sorry for maxing out your credit card and not reading your book.
well, listen, you have much bigger problems to deal with.
speaking of, what now?
I know what I have to do, but I just need to know that you'll be there for me.
always.
I was hoping I'd find you back here.
how did you... - Lily called me.
she said I might owe you an explanation for ending our date.
Oh, it wasn't a date, and you don't.
well, I think I do.
truth is, I have a history with girls who lie, and you seemed really honest and straightforward, which I liked.
but then I overhead a conversation with your mom, and, uh...
my mom.
where to begin?
well, to start, she's insanely overprotective.
she never wanted me to be an actress and said that New York would destroy my soul.
so...
I lie and tell her that I'm at Michigan State, Poli Sci major.
I love her, but I'm doing it to protect her... and myself.
I don't know.
family can be tricky.
no, I know. I just went through this huge thing with my grandfather and my cousin, and suddenly I'm left with no family at all, so...
I can relate.
although my cousin did try and have me killed, so maybe our situations are slightly different.
but I'm sorry. I should have asked you earlier.
how about a do-over?
well, if I'm being honest, um...
it's really fun to hear about your world, but I don't know if wanna be in it.
no, I understand.
so, uh, thank you for being honest.
there you are. I've been looking for your mother.
she isn't here.
well, I'll just have to tell you.
I know where Blair is, and I have no intention of sharing that information with any of the Grimaldis.
in fact, when I see her,
I am going to tell her I don't care what I have to sell.
I want her to stay as far away from you as possible.
in fact, for future reference, the Waldorfs do not give in to threats.
your family cannot control mine.
Yes, they can.
Louis... I'm ready to go on our honeymoon now.
my bags are in the car downstairs.
Blair, you do not have to do this. You do not have to go with him.
Yes, I do.
I heard what you said, mother, but I don't believe in saving myself and ruining our family at the same time.
it's just a year.
it's not that long, right?
sweetheart.
everything okay?
fine.
thank you for bringing that up...
and for everything else.
I meant what I said. Whatever you need, I'm here for you.
we need to go.
don't look so sad, B.
at least your prison is a palace.
wait. You're posting a video of Blair with Louis?
what about the photo of everyone at the airport hotel?
isn't that the scoop you were looking for?
no.
that photo has been rendered irrelevant due to the fact that Blair and Louis are together right now, leaving for their honeymoon.
but tomorrow's another day.
you forget I know who sent the video of Blair and Chuck to "Gossip Girl" in the first place.
but you can't reveal your source.
everyone would stop sending tips.
Oh, darling, of course they would, which is why I have something else planned.
my dear, sweet Philip.
since Gossip Girl abandoned her post after Blair's accident, it's been my civic duty to step in and continue her important work.
it's a dirty job, but someone's gotta do it.
the world needs Gossip Girl.
I'm gonna grab a water.
why did she choose him?
I would have done anything for her.
I know, but you shouldn't have sent that video in to "Gossip Girl."
don't you mean you shouldn't have?
come on, Chuck. You can stop pretending now.
I found the camera where you left it in the bridal chamber, and I put it in my purse.
I figured it was worth lying and saying that I did it if
if you two could be together again.
I wasn't lying.
I didn't do it.
but if--if you didn't do it, and I didn't, then who did?
some secrets I'll never tell.
but most secrets make for excellent blackmail material.
that's how it goes on the Upper East Side.
gossip girl here
your one and only source into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
this is my granddaughter, charlie rhodes.
no one can touch me anymore. I'm a rhodes now.
my husband and I were looking for my niece with the same name, remember?
did you ever find her? - She was with her mother.
if they ever found out the truth about the real charlotte rhodes, they would never forgive me.
I'm leaving tonight.
this time, i'm not coming back.
you must be pretty desperate to flirt with me by doing manual labor.
this isn't flirting. I've always wanted to load a catering van.
I love you, dan humphrey. Always have. Always will.
you saw the chance to be her only savior, her knight in shining armor.
are you really mad about blair, or is this about us, because I haven't given you an answer yet?
you just did.
of course I love you, chuck. I've always loved you.
I know who sent the video of blair and chuck to "gossip girl" in the first place.
it's a dirty job, but someone's gotta do it.
there is nothing between us but a contract.
our marriage is all for show.
you and your family will quite literally pay the consequence, or did you forget about the dowry?
your family cannot control mine.
Yes, they can.
I don't believe in saving myself and ruining our family at the same time.
another picture-perfect valentine's day on the upper east side, and how am I going to celebrate?
by exposing a giant secret today that's sure to break more than a few hearts.
you can just drop those right there. Thank you.
miss blair! You're back!
I-I was worried you'd be locked away in big, stone tower somewhere and only way to speak is through smoke signals or coded messages on twitter.
thankfully, dorota, we don't need to learn navajo just yet.
the truth is, after our horrid faux honeymoon,
I think louis was glad to get back to monaco and be rid of me for a little while.
so this mean you no longer trapped in his evil grasp.
not exactly.
Dorota, this is estee, a.k. a.My new social secretary.
A. k.a. My royal minder, but I've just been calling her "creeper" for short.
estee will be accompanying me now on all official public outings.
did I mention she also reads my mail and performs nightly bed checks?
blair's first public appearance will be this evening, just as soon as she picks one of these charity galas to make her official debut as princess.
how great is that?
Oh, wow, that's beautiful.
good morning. Wh-what's all this?
it's called valentine's day, dan.
I'm picking out some cartier jewelry to give to lily tonight.
so where is she? Aren't you afraid she's gonna see it?
she's in d. c. At a fund-raiser luncheon.
won't be back till this afternoon.
and tonight, chuck has hooked us up with a huge suite at the empire.
pretty romantic, right? - Yeah, that sounds nice.
can I interest you in anything? Something for your, uh, special lady?
me? No, no, no. I have no special lady this year.
honestly, I was just coming by to pick up those blu-rays I let lily borrow.
thought maybe I could give them to blair.
you know, she's back from her honeymoon alone, so...
so you figure that if you, uh, drop them off, maybe she'll ask you to watch one with her.
well, cinema's always been intended as a communal art. It's better to watch with another person.
she's a married woman now, dan. It might be time to move on.
I appreciate the advice, dad, but I'm just trying to be a good friend.
really, it doesn't mean anything.
okay.
I can't stand seeing all these happy people, smiling, holding hands, kissing.
don't remind me.
guess it's only natural when you and I feel this anti-valentine's day.
it hasn't exactly been a banner year for either of us in the romance department.
at least the person you love told you they felt the same. Mine didn't even respond.
well, the good news is, this outsized outpouring display of public affection will be over tomorrow.
then new yorkers can go back to being their usual cold, callous selves.
hang in there.
Yeah, you, too.
Oh, I love them!
sorry. Have a good day.
I doubt that.
Oh, hey, I guess the honeymoon's over.
just the person I wanted to see.
I can't talk now. I'm busy.
wait, wait, wait, stop.
I will not allow us to go on living like this together.
the way I see it, I am mad at you for sending out that video of me and chuck to "gossip girl,
and you are mad at me for running off with dan.
so... They cancel each other out.
actually, yours was way worse. I- I only needed a ride, but the point is
Blair, I didn't release the video to "gossip girl.
you took the fall for us?
it seemed like the right thing to do at the time.
well, since you're clearly looking out for my best interests, I forgive you.
now can you forgive me for using your wedding date as a getaway driver?
well, I was never really mad at you.
okay, well, tell me what incredible romantic plans you have for today.
Oh, you know, just interviewing a 70-year-old avowed celibate woman for my "all the reasons I hate valentine's day" column, and trying to figure out ways not to become her.
that sounds like an absolutely awful valentine's day.
they've all been pretty awful for the past few years.
the last good one I had was in high school with
you were about to say "with him." - I have to go.
I heard you were back, and I suspected you might not have any big plans tonight, so I thought I would, uh, drop off some movies.
I could come back and watch them with you. I mean, under the radar, of course.
that is sweet, but I actually already have plans to go back on the radar, which you should, too. You should go out with someone. Have fun.
if only it were that easy. I don't think I've had a real date on valentine's day since, since high school with...Well, serena.
I've gotta go meet alessandra at fig & olive to discuss my next opus, so have a nice night.
you, too, dan.
I am suddenly feeling inspired, which is why I want to upgrade my royal status from princess to queen... Of hearts.
and what that mean exactly?
it means that I will do everything in my power to get dan and serena back together.
Hello?
Lola, hey, it's nate.
who? - Archibald. From the wedding.
Oh, that nate. The one I don't remember giving my number to.
Yeah, well, I might have put a little pressure on your boss.
blackmailing bosses may have been the reason I didn't give you my number in the first place.
Hey, I only offered him some free advertising in "the spectator," all right?
technically, that's more of a bribe.
all right, either way, what are you doing tonight?
and whatever excuse you're about to give, i'm gonna poke holes in it, okay?
do you have any idea how cheesy it is to ask a girl out for a first date on valentine's day?
well, I prefer bold and charming to cheesy, but that's just
also, did you forget that I'm a cater waiter?
because valentine's is one of our busiest nights of the year, so thanks for asking.
okay, tina, my other informants have come up with nothing but a new princess under 24-hour surveillance, a lonely boy with no plans, and a dog lover who hates the entire holiday.
please tell me you have something better.
I'm afraid not. Nate can't even get a cater waiter to go out with him.
what the hell am I paying you people for?
what am I gonna do?
under my stewardship,"gossip girl" is but a shell of her former self, like aol or courtney love.
the only way to remedy this is with a scandal to end all scandals.
you have a scandal.
Dan humphrey is the one who sent you that video of chuck and blair at blair's wedding.
and with that to hold over his head, you could get dan to do almost everything.
Philip, it's cute when you pay attention.
but if I'm going to load up dan like a hirsute hand grenade,
I need everyone to be there when he detonates.
it was so much easier to stir stuff up when we were all in high school and at the same place all the time.
no.
it's too bad you can't all jump into a time machine and go back to high school then, huh?
sweetie. I knew I married you for a reason... Besides your money.
why didn't you tell me about the party?
which party?
the "come as you were" party you're throwing here tonight.
it's all over "gossip girl."Dress as your high school self.
that's awesome. I wish you would have given me a little more notice, though.
I have to deck the place out. I have to get the gift bags ready.
I have to - Tina, I'm not throwing a party.
all right? This is someone's idea of a joke.
it is? - Yeah.
too bad,'cause that would have been great publicity for "the spectator.
although it probably would have been impossible to find a caterer this last minute.
wait. Wait, wait, wait.
you know what? Why not? It is a good idea.
all right, well, see what you can pull together, and, uh, I'll handle the caterer.
guess what, boys and girls? Looks like school's back in session.
the question is, have you learned your lessons?
let's hope not,'cause I'm in the mood to see someone fail.
Rufus, hi.
are you okay? What are you doing here? We were so worried about you.
Oh, no, I'm fine. I'm totally fine. I...
I probably should have called weeks ago, but, uh, is lily here?
she's, uh, on her way back from d. c.
but I'm sure she'd love to see you.
Yeah, I'd love to see her, too. i'm only in town for a few hours on my way to europe.
I just wanted to explain to her in person why I left so abruptly.
Yeah. So... Why did you leave so
Oh, no, it's personal.
no offense. It's just, I'd rather tell her on my own.
well, you're welcome to stay and wait till she gets back.
Thanks.
and you know, I've been keeping up on what's been happening here since I left through serena's blog and "gossip girl.
I can't believe blair went through with her marriage to louis.
I really thought she was gonna end up with chuck.
Yeah, between us, I think she may have wanted to.
let's just say while love is a very complicated thing, so are prenups.
speaking of love and prenups, uh, I have to go out and pick up a few more things for lily for tonight.
so stick around. She should be back soon.
see ya.
Thanks.
thank you.
what are you doing here?
I'm supposed to meet a lovely elderly woman who is going to tell me the joys of lifelong chastity, but apparently she's late. What about you?
I'm meeting my book agent, who's also late.
Serena, I'm sorry. I should've
Dan, please, we-we don't have to discuss this.
let's just try to move past it, okay? - Okay.
can I interest you both in a glass of dom, on the house?
it's a special valentine's gift to all of our guests.
sure. I guess one glass wouldn't hurt.
it's not our fault our dates are late.
step one is accomplished.
the thaw has begun.
like beautiful polish spring.
now on to step two.
Really? She did?
no, I totally understand.
no, all right. Yeah. Have a nice day, too.
what was that? - That was the catering company.
I specifically asked for lola, that girl from the wedding, but it turns out she has a note in her file that says she can't work any events at "the spectator.
what did you do to her, nathaniel?
nothing. I didn't do anything.
she was the reason I agreed to do the party in the first place.
maybe I should just cancel the whole thing.
you're doing all this for a girl?
if she won't work a party at "the spectator," would she work one at the empire?
not if she knew I was throwing it, apparently.
as much as I absolutely loathe this day, I can't deny my best friend a chance at true love.
I'll be overseeing the usual festivities downstairs in the bar, but I'll host your party up here, and I'll even call the catering company myself.
Really? You don't mind?
that's great, man. Thank you.
excuse me.
we just wanted to tell you that we think you make a lovely couple.
who? Who, us? - Oh, no, no, no. We're not.
guess how many years we've been together.
54
come on. You're supposed to let them guess.
we were high school sweethearts. Been together ever since.
best 54 years of my life.
sorry. I-I don't think we ordered this.
this is also on the house, for all our guests.
I don't see any other tables here with this dessert.
and it's strange that neither one of our meetings showed up.
okay, alessandra said someone left her a voice mail, saying I was canceling.
same with the virgin. She called the office to reschedule.
gee, I wonder who could be manipulative enough to call all these people and get away with it.
it's too bad it's not valentine's day more than once a year.
I could really make a serious go at this whole cupid thing.
Darena" going very smooth.
now that they're actually talking again, we just need to figure out a way to get them both to nate's party tonight.
once they see each other in their old uniforms, how could all those old feelings not come flooding back?
it's true. You never forget first love.
I remember mine. Kazimierz.
once, he took me out into sugar beet field...
thank god.
Nate's party has been moved to the empire.
I told estee we'd stop by, but there's no way I can bring a royal minder to my ex's apartment.
looks like you'll just have to wear a school uniform and play cupid in my place.
Oh, no. This is very bad plan.
Damn!
Nate's party has been moved to a suite at the empire.
so?
so he lives with chuck.
I highly doubt blair's gonna risk running into her ex with a royal minder in tow, which means that when I drop my bomb, the person it would hurt the most won't even be there.
Damn!
Oh, no. This better not be someone telling me that serena's bailing, too.
I hooked up a doorman at the van der woodsens' with some free knicks tickets a couple years ago.
best decision I ever made.
I think he saw something that might be of interest to you.
does she know that I'm gone?
okay. Well, uh, tell her i'm running an errand, and I'll be back in a few hours.
okay, thanks.
I'm sorry, but, um, no one's home right now.
I'm hurt. You don't remember me?
I met you last year at the constance party when you were pretending to be mentally ill.
although you're still hanging around here, so maybe you really are.
right. Georgina, is it?
I gave you my number, but you never called, which is why when I heard you were back in town,
I thought I'd come by and catch you in person, especially since you have a habit of bolting so quickly from places.
so... What are you doing here?
just in town for a brief visit, that's all.
anybody know you're back?
only rufus and I'd appreciate it if it stayed that way.
no problem.
just... Give me some gossip.
or are you gossip enough?
look, georgina, I just got here. I don't know anything.
come on now. You're part of the family. You must know something.
all I know is that blair and louis signed sort of a prenup, but in this town, that's hardly news.
you know, you really should have called me.
we could've had a lot of fun.
well, at least now I can.
Philip, find out who represents the grimaldi family in new york and meet me there.
and we're probably gonna have to file for divorce.
looks like gossip girl just got her first valentine's day gift.
how was your lunch with the vestal virgin?
helpful and informative or ghost of v-day future?
you can stop. I know that you canceled my interview and set me up with dan.
it was an act of goodwill. Just because I can't have love in my own life doesn't mean I shouldn't bring it to the people who I care about most.
but dan doesn't have feelings for me, and-and there's nothing that will change that, not some champagne or dazzling dessert.
not even two fake old people in love?
they weren't real? - Actor's equity.
but you're wrong. Do you know what dan said to me this morning?
same thing you did.
his last good valentine's day was in high school-with you.
I'm telling you, there's still a glimmer of hope there.
that's never gonna happen, but thank you for trying.
wait, wait, wait.
why don't you come with me and my new royal minder to the cardiac ball tonight?
we can bond over our mutual broken hearts while looking at people with actual broken hearts.
thank you. I think I'll just stay home, eats lots of gelato, and write about how true love is nothing but a myth.
Hey, I was in the neighborhood, so I just wanted to stop by and tell you in person i'm not gonna be able to make it tonight.
come on, man. You, too?
Chuck's gonna be working. Blair and serena are no-shows.
I mean, wh-what's up? You have a hot date or something?
hardly. Blair's trying to set me up with serena, which reminded me, I didn't exactly have a great time in high school, so I'm not eager to relive it.
before you say "no," think about this.
there's gonna be grown women here dressed like schoolgirls.
I know. I'm sorry. I - I can't make it. If it makes you feel any better...
I will totally sign your yearbook.
no, it doesn't.
what is it?
it's, um, something strange.
of course I love you, chuck. I've always loved you.
you know what? On second thought, I think i will come tonight. I mean, who doesn't like schoolgirls?
Yes!
Hello? - Have you heard from lily?
it's getting late, and I really need to catch my flight.
Charlie, I feel terrible.
her train was delayed, so she's headed straight to, uh, the empire.
I'm meeting her there now.
can I swing by there on my way to the airport?
do you wanna just call her?
No! It's really important.
Yeah. O-okay, okay, I'll tell her you're on your way.
I know. You're mad at me for trying to set you up with serena.
actually, not really. We kinda had a nice time today, which got me to thinking that there may be hope for us yet.
I knew it. I knew there was still something between you.
now go ask her to nate's party.
guitar hero" in one suite, a sushi bar in the other.
a girl gets beaned with a nairtini or someone uses a secret key to sneak into the pool.
it's just like old times.
that sounds romantic, but I was thinking it might be better to explore whatever future we might have without the-the pressure of a real date, you know?
what do you mean?
well, you did such a good job playing cupid at lunch that I thought you could do it again, so why don't you come with us?
I would love to help, but I've suddenly got this royal...
pain in the ass from monaco who's watching my every move, so I don't think it's such a good idea for me to bring her to chuck's.
no, what better place to bring her? you could finally prove that chuck is no longer a threat, and nate said he's probably not even gonna be there tonight.
Chuck won't be there? - no.
fine. I'll make a swing by quickly on the way to the cardiac ball, but just to drop her and go, okay?
Thanks. I'll see you there.
I can't believe everything in blair's prenup - Money, chateaus, portraits.
real estate, yachts, jewels.
she owns half a museum?
pay dirt.
it says here blair defaults on the marriage in any way, the waldorf family will owe the royals so much money, they'll be bankrupt.
and this helps us how?
we're going to show the world what blair really thinks of her vows, and we're gonna use dan to do it.
look out, b.You may be trying to play cupid, but all the arrows are pointed right at you.
okay, so please tell me again why we're here, why I'm dressed like this, and why you're not?
you told me your last good valentine's day was in high school, and since taking you to an actual constancest. Jude party felt wrong on too many levels, i'm taking you to the next best thing - A simulation.
Yeah, but I feel strange, and people are looking at me.
trust me, s. I have a big surprise for you tonight.
isn't this your ex-boyfriend charles bass' hotel?
and we're coming here on valentine's day? I hardly think the royal family would
listen, estee, we are simply dropping by so I can do one nice thing for a friend before heading to the cardiac ball.
Chuck bass is not a threat, and I think it's important for the world to see...
Chuck, what are you doing here?
just leaving. Enjoy your evening, ladies.
see that? We're friends now.
we've put it all behind us, so feel free to alert the media if you want.
classy party, blair.
is this the type of dignified function I can be looking forward to attending with you in the future?
trust me, we'll be leaving momentarily.
since bass seems to be the issue here, why don't I keep my eye on him?
downstairs, with people not wearing plaid or eating jell-o.
Hey, don't give me that look.
you said you didn't wanna work a party at "the spectator," so this isn't "the spectator.
wait, wait, wait. Just hear me out, okay?
I think I did a pretty good job of addressing your concerns.
I mean, we're not having some cheesy valentine's date here, okay?
you get to see my world up close, maybe change your mind about it, and you don't have to miss work if you don't want to.
come on. Just say a quick hello. You have to.
Serena would kill me if she knew that I saw you and didn't drag you upstairs.
no, dan, I told you, I really don't have time. I need to go find lily
no, it's too late. Too late.
Hey, look who I saw racing through the lobby as I was listening to st. Vincent? Good-bye.
Charlie, what are you doing here? And where have you been for the past three months?
I know. I just felt really overwhelmed and guilty about...The car accident, especially since chuck and blair were leaving my party when it happened.
so I went back to florida.
but, uh, you know, honestly, I really shouldn't be here right now.
I came to apologize to your mom on my way to catching a flight.
do you have her room?
I'll text her. Don't worry about it.
but first you have to tell me all about your past three months and-and what it's like living with carol again.
sorry. - Excuse me.
what are you doing? - Hold still.
Serena really digs that outsider thing. So I'm helping.
B. t.w.this tie didn't work for you in high school, and it doesn't work now.
so here's what I'm thinking. Take serena somewhere quiet, like
I don't know - Nate's room or something.
wait a second. I really don't think I can go through with this.
you're really nervous, which is cute.
it is like high school all over again. Listen, you have nothing to worry about, dan.
Serena already likes you. You know that.
look, I'm telling you, just be your charming, wonderful self like you've been with me all year.
you think I've been wonderful?
are you kidding me?
look at everything we've been through together.
you kept it a secret when I found out I was pregnant.
you shielded me from the world so I could deal with my paternity test, and you brought me to a priest in my darkest hour.
you wrote louis' vows for him, and then you saved me from my own wedding.
do I need to go on?
no.
so... If you're that guy with serena, how could she not love you?
you gonna make your move or what?
I will be right back.
Charlie, welcome back. Serena, can we talk?
Yeah, of course.
promise to call me the moment you get back from europe, okay?
I will. Promise.
it's charlotte rhodes from florida. We took that acting class together.
uh, yeah. Charlotte.
Hi. It's good to see you. What are you doing here?
I was about to ask you that same question.
so... Dan is looking for you.
Blair, that's not funny.
I'm not joking. That was my big surprise.
unlike you, he thought your lunch date went great, and he wants to explore things further.
now I'm leaving, so go find him and see what happens.
go!
Georgina. You're gossip girl?
what? no.
no, that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
okay. I'm not... Gossip girl. I just...
I work for her, and believe me, the job is a lot harder than I thought.
okay, look, your blackmailing days are over.
if you tell anyone that I leaked that video of blair and chuck at her wedding, then I'll tell everyone that you're gossip girl's henchman.
don't you think you're overreacting here?
I mean, I was just trying to help your relationship along by getting you to finally kiss blair.
I couldn't handle the lack of action any longer.
all those endless pauses and pained stares. So boring.
she wants you to kiss her, too.
the fact that you haven't just done it already would be shocking if you weren't, well, you.
what is going on?
everything's fine. Georgina was just leaving, weren't you?
Yes, I was. This party is so 2007 anyway.
what are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be at some fancy gala?
I still have this.
and I just need to know one thing.
I sent serena to look for you.
am I just setting her up for disappointment?
do you really want us to get back together?
I just want you to be happy.
tell me what would make you happy, dan.
wait. Hey, georgina!
sorry, s.
looks like your seven minutes in heaven just turned into seven seconds from hell.
drinking by himself on valentine's day. Look out.
do I know you?
Yeah. Alessandra. We met at dan's book party.
I have a vague memory.
well, it's a good thing I have a vivid one.
I'm here with a bunch of single girlfriends, and it is super depressing.
buy me a drink.
unless... Forgive the drunken brazenness here, but...
what do you say we head off to your room and make the rest of this dreadful holiday go away together?
thanks... But maybe last year.
Oh, my god. What is wrong with me?
I was trying to get you two back together.
I thought that's what you both wanted. It's not my fault he kissed me.
not your fault? What, you sound like you're still in high school.
says the girl in the constance uniform.
did you not believe me that I didn't send that video in?
of course I believed you.
okay, well, then what is it?
what, you just wanna take away something that matters to me?
did you even care about dan?
B.how many times can we fight like this? Aren't you sick of it?
they say people keep fighting about the same things until it breaks them apart.
you know what? Maybe we're there.
there you are. We really have to go.
I couldn't agree more.
the last thing my mother ever wanted was for me to be an actress, let alone live in new york city, so I applied to julliard behind her back.
now, well, she thinks I'm busy rushing sororities in michigan state, and I'm actually here, taking classes and going by "lola.
just working jobs like this one to make ends meet.
but what about you? Are you acting out here?
Yeah. Yeah, kind of.
I mean, you know, I - I got cast in this one part, and it paid really well, but it took a lot longer than I expected, and it was way more complicated than I thought.
all right, has anyone ever told you two how much you guys look alike?
I mean, you could almost be sisters.
my mom used to say the same thing. You remember her, don't you?
no. No, not really.
and I didn't realize how late it was getting. So I'm going to go.
you know, we should exchange numbers sometime.
well, I'd say an apology is in order after all your "i'm not comfortable in your world" talk, because you totally knew someone at my party.
Yeah, you're right. You're right. I stand corrected.
but why was ivy dickens here anyway?
Oh, she's my friend's cousin. Her real name's charlie rhodes.
I'm sorry. "real name"?
Yeah. You didn't know? Apparently, her mom is a crazy woman down in florida who made her go by the name "ivy dickens" growing up.
it must have been when you knew her, but after last spring when she moved here to live with her family,
and that name is... Charlie rhodes?
Yeah. What?
Dan, give it
give me one good reason why I shouldn't just smash this phone on the floor right now?
fine.
no problem. I've already e-mailed myself the picture anyway.
doesn't matter. You can't do anything with it anyway, 'cause the second you do, we'll just out you as the "gossip girl" spy you are.
I'm not her spy, you idiot. I am her.
watching you and blair squirm with unfulfilled desire is way more fun than any damage one picture could cause.
what does that mean?
it means that the girl you love finally gave you a sign that she likes you back, and there's not a damn thing either of you can do about it without destroying not only blair's marriage but her family's entire financial future.
her family? I don't understand.
she didn't tell you about her prenup?
if blair defaults in her marriage in any way, the dowry she'd owe would bankrupt eleanor.
and, sweetie, if blair hated you for being poor before, imagine how much she'd hate you for making her poor, too.
I have something I think you'd like to see.
and in your bedroom, no less.
has she no decency?
anyway, happy valentine's day.
Blair! Blair, wait a second.
just give me one more minute, okay? Sorry.
why didn't you tell me about the prenup?
is that why you went back with louis?
I just can't risk my family's future like that.
I have no choice but to stay trapped in my marriage for at least a year.
so your feelings for louis... - Are all business.
how about your feelings for me?
cause that kiss - It wasn't like last year.
you-you kissed me back. I felt it.
doesn't matter what you think you felt, because serena's my best friend, and I would never do anything to hurt her.
I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression.
have A happy valentine's day.
amazing. You got exactly what you wanted.
so what are you waiting for? Use it.
if I post this picture, dan will out me.
and I'm not sure I'm willing to give up being gossip girl over one little kiss.
so what are we gonna do?
Dan knows how blair feels about him now, which means the more they can't, the more they'll want to.
it won't be long before they're doing far worse things than kissing.
speaking of... I'm kinda digging this whole high school look.
well, it is valentine's day, and you have been uncharacteristically helpful today.
sure. Why not?
Oh, not it.
I know I promised you all I'd expose a giant secret today, and I didn't deliver, but isn't that what valentine's day is all about...
hopes dashed? Feelings hurt?
relationships severed?
it's a day filled with crushing disappointments.
I want you to know i'm interested in more than your body, alessandra.
I'm interested in your work, too.
tell me, what's it like being a book agent and working with my good friend dan?
where it's easy to take advantage of the vulnerable and lonely.
while some continue to pine over those great unrequited loves.
others can't help but feel like they somehow got totally screwed.
how was your aunt?
unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish it.
how is she doing? Is she okay?
I'm worried there's not much time left.
she really cares about you.
wouldn't stop talking about you while you were gone.
Mrs. Rhodes is up right now if you'd like to talk to her.
and while it'd be nice to believe that most valentine's days end well, we all know they are far more likely to end in heartbreak.
gossip girl here
your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
of course I love you, Chuck. I've always loved you.
I love you more and more every day, if it's even possible to love someone that much.
this was the only car with the keys in it.
it's fine. Just go.
you-you just wanna take away something that matters to me? Did you even care about Dan?
Yeah, I've been holed up, trying to figure out a concept for my new book.
and it's great that they gave me a deal for a second one, but that means I actually have to come up with something to write about.
I have something I think you'd like to see.
Charlie Trout. - Do I know you?
Yeah, Alessandra. We met at Dan's book party.
what's it like being a book agent and working with my good friend Dan?
if they ever found out the truth about the real Charlotte Rhodes, they would never forgive me.
Ivy! It's Charlotte Rhodes! From Florida. We took that acting class together.
uh, yeah. Charlotte.
why was Ivy Dickens here anyway?
Oh, she's my friend's cousin. Her real name's Charlotte Rhodes.
I'm sorry. Real name?
I'm worried there's not much time left.
Mrs. Rhodes is up right now if you'd like to talk to her.
you shouldn't have sent that video in to "gossip girl."
I didn't do it.
then who did?
I'll never tell.
february is the shortest month, but the bitter chill makes it feel the longest.
the smart ones, like me, escape to more tropical climates, while some of my upper east side friends use the time to hunker down and finish their work.
others snuggle up in bed with their agendas to keep them warm.
and then there are the homes that feel even colder inside than it is out.
Hello?
you did not have to buy me a gift.
I wanted to. I hope you like it.
it's gorgeous. - It'll look even more gorgeous on you.
lunch today so I can see it?
I can't. Dan's turning in his book proposal.
he's making a big deal about it, even getting it bound.
a messenger's picking it up at 11: 00.
I have to read it before it goes off to Jonathan Karp.
so what about after you're done?
Oh, okay. Come by around 5: 00?
it's a date.
dad, what are you doing here?
it's so cold, I came to get my green down puffy jacket.
which is here because... Lily hates it, and she'd throw it out if she got her hands on it.
well, you might wanna listen to a woman with taste.
that reminds me, how's everything going with Blair?
that's a nice transition, but we haven't really spoken.
I've been busy with my book proposal, and she's busy...
with, uh, her princess stuff, so, you know.
no, I don't. And you guys kissed.
which is why it's better to stay clear of her.
nothing good could come of us hanging out right now.
so if we're not gonna be more than friends, it's too hard to be... Just friends.
is that your proposal?
Oh, congratulations. At least you're using your solo time to be productive.
Yeah, I actually feel really good about it.
Hey, would you mind waiting, uh, for the messenger to come pick this up?
cause Chuck invited me over, and I'm gonna stop by on my way to the library.
he's not still mad at you for running off with Blair at the wedding?
well, I guess neither of us is letting our feelings for Blair keep us down.
speaking of down, Lily was right. That jacket is terrible.
why does everybody hate this jacket?
I told you that I'm sorry. I - I don't know what came over me.
I'm not sure it even was me, because why would I ever kiss Humphrey?
Oh, so that's your excuse - Multiple personality disorder?
or did an alien take over your body?
I would never do anything to hurt you.
too late.
look, it was a mistake. What do you want me to do?
Self-flagellate? Wear a hair shirt?
if you're referring to the hideous fur vest you wore yesterday, i'm the only one that suffered because I had to look at it.
can you pass the salt, please?
looks like we're all out.
I go get more.
and I'd like some more bacon. Crisp, please.
Oh, why don't you just take mine? You don't seem to have a problem doing that.
how much longer can you go on?
enough! I can't take this!
no, she didn't. - Oh, yes, she did.
Dorota, come on! - Let us out, Dorota!
you not coming out until you work this out!
I don't care if it takes all day!
don't look at me. She works for you.
I'm glad you called, Nate.
I'm glad you said yes. So what have you been up to since the party?
I'm supposed to be doing schoolwork, but I'm really just procrastinating.
you know, hanging out with friends and trying to get to know the city even better.
Oh, and, um... I friended that girl Ivy- Um, Charlie- On facebook, but I never heard back from her.
Yeah, well, she's in Europe, so maybe that's why.
did she go with friends or just by herself?
I don't really know.
do you not like her or something?
no, no, I do. I mean, she and I this thing. It was nothing major.
but if you're asking, I thought you should know. I'm trying to be honest.
well, I appreciate that. Honesty is hard to come by these days.
Yeah.
not that I'm one to talk. My mom doesn't even know I live here.
Oh, hey, that's my friend Dan's book. Are you reading it?
actually, I'm performing it at the upright citizens brigade.
it's this improv group, and they have a book night where they read excerpts from current novels.
they're doing "inside" tonight.
let me guess. The reading's just you guys mocking it, right?
pretty much. But it's not bad for Dan. He should come.
you can invite him yourself. He's on his way up.
we're taking monkey for a walk.
I thought since he's the reason i'm saddled with the mutt, he can freeze his ass, too.
so you guys are okay.
here's monkey's playdate now.
good to see you, Humphrey.
is it? - Of course.
losing Blair was tough on us both, but it's not your fault.
so you're not mad about what happened?
because she used you as her getaway driver?
Humphrey, you two can play "driving miss Waldorf" as much as you want.
as for me, I'm not interested in mooning over the woman who broke my heart.
I'm a sadist, not a masochist.
I think you might be on to something there.
aren't I always?
as for monkey, I'm afraid he'll have to wait.
Nathaniel's new friend would like to speak with you about "inside."
I'll just put these away for now.
espresso? - Sure.
so what's this I hear about my book?
Oh,Lola's performing it at a theater.
with The upright citizens brigade. Have you heard of them?
this is ridiculous. I'm married.
and I haven't seen Dan since valentine's day.
which proves my point. Whenever you have feelings for someone that you can't deal with, you avoid them.
I am not avoiding him.
if you don't remember, I have a royal minder who watches my every move.
okay, well, then if you don't have feelings for him, then spending time with Dan shouldn't be a problem for him or you.
it isn't. And I'll prove it to you.
how?
by hanging out with him all day.
why don't you come with me?
I'm not spending the day with you and Dan.
and what would that prove anyway?
that he and I are nothing more than old friends.
I'll point out the sadness of his hair, clothing, Brooklyn roots, and he will decry my constructive criticism as snobbery.
we'll share our views on recent French cinema.
and there will be no kissing!
open up!
everything fixed? - Not even close.
it will be. Now I have to gather up Dan's DVDs.
and you wait hear and tell Estee when she arrives that I'm with Dan
my friend who I'm not avoiding because he's just my friend.
send pics!
I'm so psyched. I read about the, uh, Bret Easton Ellis one a while back.
Yeah, he came by the rehearsal, which was really cool.
you should come. I mean, I'm sure the other actors would love to meet you.
Wow. That'd be - That'd be great.
I just have to make a phone call, but, uh, my phone is dead. Can I use yours?
Yeah, of course.
Thanks.
so what's next? The worldwide musical of your book?
uh, yeah, I was thinking mimes.
mimes can be pretty cool.
Hey, Nate. Is everything okay?
not really. Don't hang up.
look, I know you're using my name. I just don't know why.
are you in trouble?
it's... Complicated.
but I swear, I am not doing anything to hurt you.
well, then explain it to me.
I... I can't. Just... Just let it go, Lola, please. I'm sorry.
I think the police would be really interested in hearing about you.
you know, stealing someone's identity is a felony.
it's been so cold, I've just wanted to lay low, you know?
so I just got off the phone with the director and I have to go in early. Are you ready, Dan?
Yeah. Chuck, if you don't mind taking a rain check on our dog walk...
not at all. A cold walk with monkey or basking in the glow of your book success?
no-brainer.
call me.
I've been calling you for days. Why haven't you called me back?
I'm at a silent yoga retreat in upstate New York.
that's funny. You and your daughter are both in New York.
no, she isn't. She's in college.
Yeah. Yeah, Julliard.
and apparently, one of her extracurricular activities is partying at Nate Archibald's.
and she goes by "Lola" now.
what? How could that happen?
I don't know.
but you need to get her out of there before this whole scheme blows up in your face.
I have to go, but thank you for getting back to me.
who was it?
you haven't called the family, have you?
I'm feeling so much better. I don't want to worry them.
no, it was the pharmacy. They forgot to deliver one of your medications.
now let's get you back to bed.
take this to Humphrey's agent. Same address.
careful, lonely boy.
looks like someone is finding some cold comfort in some red-hot revenge.
I need a taxi to take me to the train station.
Thanks. - I'll be right back.
is everything okay?
I'm worried. Miss Cece's having trouble breathing.
I think we need to get her to the hospital.
okay.
then we need to go against her wishes and tell the rest of the family.
I know she'll be mad, but it's right thing to do.
they should be with her.
I'll make arrangements for her travel while you call your mom and aunt.
you know, I think it'd be best if you call them.
I get confused with all the medical terms.
all right.
what are you doing here now?
I couldn't wait.
Oh, well, you're gonna have to.
I'm just about to read Dan's proposal so we can send it on to his editor.
you should send it now, because what I have in mind is going to take the whole... Afternoon.
that's, um, that's not how the process works.
it's Dan. Everyone's going to love it.
I did read an... Earlier draft, and it was in excellent shape.
I'm sure all he's done is changed a few commas here and there.
I should, um - Lock the door?
already done.
hold all my calls and messenger dan's proposal on to Jonathan Karp.
so these people are all here to perform my book?
Yeah. Actually, there was a fight over who got to play Clair.
I won.
knew which prop to bring.
this is our director, Connor.
Dan, hey, so glad that you could make it to rehearsal.
is there anything I can do?
just be a good sport and get ready to be mocked.
well, that's my entire life, so I think I can manage that.
great.
so we're starting with the deb ball and the destruction of the gown scene, right?
Yes, we're gonna start with that.
did that actually happen?
no, not really, although Charlie did steal Serena's deb gown once.
so you're close with Charlie, too?
sort of. We had-we had this thing. We, uh, kissed.
kind of. Uh, it's weird i'm even saying that.
jeez, that Charlie gets around.
Yeah.
I'm just gonna take this, actually.
Nate? Hey, what's up?
you tell me. Didn't your phone die?
I charged it.
if you wanted Charlie's number, you could've just asked.
okay, you're using me to get to her. Why?
I have to go to rehearsal now, but...
maybe if you came down here to get a bite to eat with me between now and the performance, we could talk about it then?
all right. See you then.
she's in-she's in a closed door meeting? All right, well, just tell Alessandra I called.
thank you.
Humphrey! There you are.
what are you doing here? - What are you doing here?
well, I saw you on the "gossip girl" "spotted" map, and I-I thought I'd come by and drop these dvds off.
you looked me up on "gossip girl"? What's going on, Blair?
what? Nothing.
can't a friend stop by to hang out with another friend to do...
whatever it is we're doing here?
we're not doing anything here. You're gonna go home, and I'm busy.
and after what happened at Nate's, I think us being together is a recipe for disaster.
don't be silly, Humphrey.
we can get past that and be friends, just like old times.
in fact, you know, let's take a photo of our friendship so we can remember this moment forever.
Hey! You... In the hideous headband.
come, take a picture!
smile!
Serena should see how much fun we're having right now.
you know, that headband is giving me Hillary Clinton flashbacks.
the bad kind.
Oh, yeah. I would never wear it myself. I just have it on because i'm playing Clair.
Humphrey, these pathetic people are playing us? I mean, really?
the look like they work in... A thrift store.
it is so nice of you to stop by and have tea on your way back from your retreat.
I don't know how you stayed silent for that long. I think I would probably burst.
it's challenging, but it really gives you a feeling of peace, especially because I miss Charlie so much.
we do, too.
did she have fun while she was here?
I heard Nate had a terrific Valentine's day party.
terrific for some.
uh, Serena and Blair are having some issues.
I'm sorry.
did Charlie seem okay? She mentioned that Nate might be dating someone.
uh, yeah, I think a girl named Lola, but I don't really know what's gonna happen with that.
blair's with Dan.
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.
no, believe it or not, it's actually a good thing.
what, that they're together?
Yeah, I know. As crazy as it sounds, it's-it's her way of apologizing.
and if she's willing to put whatever happened between them in the past...
I don't know. Maybe I should, too.
you know what? I'm gonna go down there and talk to her.
you two have fun.
so I know you didn't just come by for tea. What's going on?
saved by the bell. Hello?
she's right in here.
darling? Darling? Please?
come with me to the hospital.
I'll just meet you there.
no, no, please. Please stay with me.
you're the only person I feel safe with.
I - I won't leave you. I promise.
Dr. Glassman will meet us at the hospital.
Dr. Glassman's coming here?
Oh, no, dear. There's a helicopter waiting for us at the East Hampton airport to take us into the city.
the rest of the family will be at the hospital within the hour.
Clair's a dictator, and you don't even have a doorman.
for her, Brooklyn is just a place for her limo driver to pass through on her way to J.F.K.
why do you care what she thinks? - You don't have to stay, really.
nonsense. We're friends, and friends support each other.
friends aren't afraid to be with each other or feel awkward together.
do you want me to hold your hand for support?
no.
all right, everybody, let's take five.
do you, uh, do you need me right now? Please need me.
Yeah. So in the scene where Clair kisses Dylan, is that, like, a passionate kiss or is it just a sweet one?
I've got this one, Humphrey.
first off, if you had done your homework, you would know the answer.
I mean, even gossip girl knows that.
who's gossip girl?
I thought this theater company was professional.
have you never heard of research?
log on and learn everything you need to know about me, stat.
but you can skip my entire freshman year of college.
secondly, Clair would never kiss Dylan passionately ever.
if she had to kiss him at all, it would be perfunctory, like shaking someone's hand or petting a dog.
I - I don't understand.
it's because you're listening to the ramblings of a deranged person.
Blair, go home.
are you intentionally being obtuse?
I mean, a Clair-Dylan kiss would mean nothing.
do you mind if I show her?
actually, I do.
it should look like this.
Hey, is everything okay?
Humphrey, you weren't supposed to kiss back. You ruined it.
Yeah, you're right. This is my fault.
Hey, you guys know what happened to Serena? She just walked out of here all upset.
Oh, god. She saw us kissing again.
Serena, wait!
look, it wasn't what it looked like.
please, just stop.
just even if it hurts me, be real with me for a second and tell me the truth, that you-that you like Dan.
I... I don't. I'm... I'm married and... I promised Chuck i'd wait for him.
and then there's the clause in the prenup.
Oh, come on. We both know if you have feelings for someone, nothing else in the world matters.
that's not true. We're not servants to our emotions.
we can control them, suppress them, stomp them out like bugs.
you know, I-I can't do this anymore.
I can't stand here and listen to you lie to me and-and lie to yourself. I'm done.
looks like S. And B. Can't find any refuge from the nasty cold.
Hey, mom, can I call you back, please?
Oh, my god.
you are trouble.
I take that as a compliment.
allow me.
Oh, my god. You made me miss four calls from Jonathan Karp.
I wonder what's going on.
Yes, it's Alessandra for Jonathan.
they must've really loved Dan's proposal to call back this quickly.
jonathan, hi. yes.
you read it? Didn't you love it? I mean, unexpected but it's...
plagiarized? That's impossible.
you look like you have your hands full. I'll just leave you with this.
I'm sure there must be some explanation.
will you excuse us?
no. No, no, p-please don't go. I'm in the middle of something here.
but Serena's mad at me because of the kiss, and I-I keep telling her it doesn't mean anything but
that's enough, Blair. It's enough. Really.
y - you can go if you want.
no, this is all great. I can use this.
or I can go.
I really need a friend right now.
I don't want to be your friend, Blair.
I want more. I want you. And if you don't feel the same way about me, then I don't think we should be seeing each other anymore.
I can't believe all the details gossip girl knows about your lives.
I know. It's scary, right?
so are you looking up Blair for your character or Charlie for your secret agenda?
I'm-I'm sorry I've been so mysterious.
it's just this really weird situation, and I don't want to get you wrapped up in it.
Spotted-Charlie Rhodes entering the hospital.
here's hoping it's for a checkup and not that she's being checked in.
Oh, my god.
well, I guess I know where we're going.
can you tell Connor that I had to leave?
leave? Who'll play Clair?
Hey. Hey, you.
you'd be amazing.
mother should be here by now.
I'm gonna see if there's an update.
okay, i'll just wait here, then.
wait! Mom!
mom, is grandma okay?
Yeah, I'm gonna check now.
mother?
Oh, my god. Is she unconscious?
uh, no. They just - They have her sedated.
we-we think she has a blood clot in her lung.
it's very common with cancer and chemotherapy.
chemo? She hasn't said a word. I mean
we have to get her a c. a. t. Scan immediately. Her doctor's waiting for her inside.
Charlie, what are you doing here?
I, um, I just went to visit grandma and, um...
don't be so modest, Charlie.
she's been with Ms. Rhodes for months. She's been such a solace to her.
you've been taking care of her?
Dr. Glassman, what is - What's going on?
all right, well, uh, if it is a blood clot, then Cece will need emergency surgery to remove it.
so I need you to sign some papers immediately to approve the surgery.
okay, I'll handle it. - I'll go with you.
what do you think you're doing?
look, I thought we were taking her to a hospital in the Hamptons.
Charlie, the doctor wants to talk to you, too, since you've been with her for the past few days.
this is not over.
looks like the heat just got turned up on our upper east side's favorite impostor.
there you are.
I have been calling and calling.
Oh, I'm sorry. I - I had my ringer off.
but I'm glad you got my e-mail to come tonight.
I had a bunch of books sent over to sell at the front of house.
I know the lingo. Uh, but all the proceeds are going to U.C.B.
what did you think of my proposal? - You mean the one you plagiarized?
what are you talking about?
the proposal you sent in was a condensed version of a book that was already published...
by Jonathan Karp.
"blast off" was the first book he ever edited.
Yeah, yeah. I-I know that book. It's about the first crew ever to go up in the space shuttle program.
but you know what my book is. It's a-it's an alternative history of Manhattan as a-as a monarchy.
that's not the one you sent in.
maybe you read someone else's proposal.
Yeah, I may not have technically read it.
I mean, your first draft was so good. So...
okay, but I triple-checked with the messenger company.
it came from you.
and if we can't show them this is a horrible mistake, they're talking about dropping you.
what? Why?
Dan, plagiarism is a serious offense.
okay, let me check my computer and just make sure that you got the right one, and we'll make this go away.
house opens in five.
I have been looking for you everywhere.
I was just trying to stay out of the way, give you and the family some space.
which makes sense since you're not family.
you were supposed to disappear months ago.
and I meant to.
but you realized my mother was an easy target?
No! Look, Cece had been so kind to me.
I just wanted to thank her, and when I saw her, I realized she was sick.
my grandmother died of cancer, and I saw the signs
I don't wanna hear your sob story.
well, I can't leave now. I promised Cece I would stay.
besides, what would everyone think?
well, you better hope that they don't.
I don't understand. It's-it's gone.
but you backed it up, right?
No!
Dan, is this some sort of cry for help? You can tell me.
no, I swear to you, I do not know what's going on.
maybe-maybe the messenger screwed up. Maybe someone's screwing with me.
who would go to such lengths to do this to you?
that's a nice scarf.
Thanks. It's a shahtoosh. It was a present.
I'm gonna go back to the office and try to convince Karp this was a mistake or a practical joke.
you go home and rewrite yours as fast as you can.
when did you forget who you are?
you wanted to be the most powerful woman in America.
not just America.
Really?
you always get this way when you're around Charlie Trout.
I don't know who I am without him, Sabrina.
you guys are doing a really good job here, making fun of this.
look, I-I get it. I do.
you're afraid of what people might think if you change your mind, but you can't care about them.
you never used to.
you're Clair Carlyle.
you're in control of your own destiny, and most of Manhattan's.
how did you get so smart?
can't take the credit.
it's Dylan.
we might be best friends, but Dylan and you have something that even you and I don't have.
remember when you won that essay competition, and your mother was too busy to even show up to watch you get your award?
who came, even though you treated him so terribly?
Dan came to that?
see, Dylan's always here for you, even when you don't even know it.
no matter how you treat him, he cares about you, not in spite of who you are, but because of it.
Dan loves me for me.
Yes, Dylan does.
Oh, my gosh. I - I've gotta go right now.
you know what? That's - That's not your line.
no, me. I, Blair, have to go.
any updates?
well, they're prepping her for surgery.
apparently, her cancer, which we didn't know had returned, was responding well to chemo, but then this-is just such a nightmare.
mom?
what are you doing here?
I'm sorry. Who are you looking for?
wait. Lola?
you know her? - Mom, what's going on?
Carol, what is this girl talking about? Do you know her?
Yes. Yes. She's, uh... My daughter.
what? well, then who are you?
Uh-oh, Ivy. Do you feel the chill permeating the air?
that's the upper east side turning their backs on you and tossing you out into the cold.
Carol, I don't understand.
why did you introduce this girl as your daughter? Who is she?
Yeah. We-we know that story.
Oh, my god. So max was telling the truth.
Ivy, don't say a word.
your mom hired me to be you.
why would you do that?
to protect you.
I was supposed to gain access to your trust fund for your mother, which I did, and then I went back to my own life, then I ran into you in l. a...
Oh, so then you came back to New York with me.
Yeah.
so when my private investigator found Lola, it was the real Charlotte Rhodes.
so you did all of this for money?
you hid an entire family from me for money?
you don't know these people, what they're capable of.
I - I spent my entire life running from them for you.
Yes, running from people who would take in your fake daughter as our own.
we must be monsters.
Lily, Rufus, and Serena, I understand that you're mad.
look, I'm sorry.
Charlie... Don't.
why would you do this to me?
I don't know what you're talking about.
you switched the proposal.
when I saw the shahtoosh scarf on Alessandra, I knew.
I thought that was a nice touch.
I'm impressed you know the value of quality.
you've learned so much from me in such a short period of time.
you wanted me to know it was you.
you can't prove anything.
I can't, but when Jonathan Karp sees my real proposal...
would that be before or after "page six" exposes Dan Humphrey for the plagiarist he is?
whether it's true or not, you will be tainted, and your publisher will drop you for good.
you see, you can't win against me, Humphrey.
you can't even compete.
so this is about Blair.
well, then I guess I'm not competing. I must be winning.
you wouldn't be trying this hard if I didn't have a real shot with her.
and up until this moment, I wasn't sure if I did.
so thank you.
now, uh, if you'll excuse me, i, uh, I have better things to do.
why did you come back to New York with me? You didn't have to.
and as I remember it, you didn't even want to.
I never really had a family.
you were so good to me, like a big sister I never had.
I really care about you guys.
you care about us or the money?
I suppose it was your idea to keep my grandma's relapse a secret so you could be the only one there for her when no one else was.
look, I begged her to call you.
she just didn't wanna worry you guys.
you know what? This is a family matter, okay?
so you need to leave now.
no, I promised Cece that I would stay with her. I'm not leaving.
you're nothing to her - A stranger, a nobody, so get outta here before I call the cops.
I go by "Lola" now.
I guess there have been a few things you've been hiding from me as well.
not an entire family.
my whole life, you told me it was just us.
what is so terrible about those people that you didn't want me to know them?
or is it that you didn't think I deserved to know them?
of course not. I love you!
everything... Everything I have done is to protect you, to-to protect us.
after today, there is no us.
I don't want anything to do with you.
you don't mean that.
I do.
the most painful rejection always comes from those you love the most...
Bye, mother.
and that one has to hurt.
thank you for telling me about Cece.
I'm a little afraid to go in. Serena's so mad.
Serena doesn't have anything to be mad about. You said so yourself.
well, maybe she does. Maybe she was right.
about what?
about me denying that I had feelings for you.
I came to see you today to prove that I'm not in denial.
one of my specialties - Warped logic.
it is a unique skill you have.
it's awful.
no, it's not awful. It's you. It couldn't be awful.
Humphrey... How can this happen?
the prenup and Chuck, Serena.
well, whatever this is, it will have to wait.
what if I don't want to?
I'm gonna go head in and see my dad.
so it seems you were right.
I do have feelings for Dan. I'm sorry.
you don't have to be.
but I won't see him.
not because I'm in denial, but because I care too much about your friendship.
you come first.
you're my family.
look, this isn't gonna be easy for me, but at least you're being honest.
and if our friendship is real, which I know it is, then we can get through this.
you two are gonna face a lot of obstacles, but I'm not gonna be one of 'em.
I don't wanna get in the way of you and Dan.
I'm really glad you're here, though. I need you.
so I guess we're cousins.
I guess so.
look, if you ever wanna get coffee or something, i'd love to get to know you.
Yeah.
up until ten minutes ago, I didn't even know I had a family, so...
forgive me if I'm not really interested in "coffee or something.
what do you mean that cater girl is your cousin?
Oh, there's a lot going on here.
you ready to face the mayhem?
I need to make a phone call first.
okay.
Chuck, stop trying to hurt Dan.
if you wanna be mad at anybody, be mad at me.
I could never be mad at you.
it's nice to hear you say that, really, but...
being a good person isn't just being good to me.
Dan has done nothing to you but be a friend.
you made it seem like you wanted me to wait for you.
was that a lie? - no.
did your feelings change?
no. I don't know.
but whatever happens, don't punish Dan for my confusion.
I - I need some time to figure some things out, and...
if you target him, then it'll just push us closer together, and I know you're too smart for that.
you're better than that, so please.
Blair, don't... - I- I gotta go.
as we wait for spring to come, we desperately look for the signs that the harsh winter is coming to an end.
Hello?
I'm about to send you something. Check your e-mail.
and the signs are clear
a ray of sunlight that cuts through the darkness.
thanks for waiting for me.
of course. Did you find Charlie?
Yeah.
are you okay?
I don't know. I just really have to get out of here.
Oh, well, let me get you home.
I don't really wanna be alone. Can I stay with you?
Yeah.
the bud of a new relationship popping through the frosty ground.
Hey, Alessandra just called. Chuck sent over my real proposal.
Really?
Yeah, she thinks she can salvage this.
that's great, Dan.
Yeah, wonder what made him change his mind.
I'm gonna head home.
want anything? - I'm okay. Thank you.
I'm gonna stay. Serena needs me.
a sudden spike in temperatures...
but don't you forget, upper East Siders, February isn't the end of winter in this town.
there's still a long way to go.
turns out tropical islands are boring, and the lack of scandal is getting to me.
so I've decided to turn up the heat from afar.
I have a certain e-mail from lonely boy that will make Chuck bass' blood boil.
of course I love you, Chuck. I've always loved you.
I love you more and more every day, if it's even possible to love someone that much.
Humphrey, you bastard.
but if you think winter's over, think again.
there's sure to be another cold snap...
and sadly, some won't survive the winter.
I don't have good news.
Cece had a stroke as we were prepping her for surgery.
there's nothing we can do.
you need to go in and say your good-byes.
so come out of the cold, my upper East Siders...
and into the cozy warmth of my home.
my doors are always open.
gossip girl here
your one and only source into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
you shouldn't have sent that video in to "gossip girl."
I didn't do it.
if you didn't do it and I didn't, then who did?
of course I love you, chuck. I've always loved you.
Humphrey, you bastard.
you and your family will quite literally pay the consequences.
or did you forget about the dowry?
if she defaults on the marriage, the dowry can be reinstated.
you do not have to go with them.
it's just a year. It's not that long, right?
this is Estee, a.k. a. , my royal minder, but I've just been calling her "creeper" for short.
I do have feelings for dan. I'm sorry.
this isn't gonna be easy for me, but at least you're being honest.
I don't want to get in the way of you and dan.
I think we need to get her to the hospital.
please stay with me. You're the only person I feel safe with.
I won't leave you. I promise.
mother?
Charlie, what are you doing here?
she's been with Ms. Rhodes for months. She's been such a solace to her.
mom?
why did you introduce this girl as your daughter? Who is she?
Ivy Dickens. - Your mom hired me to be you.
you hid an entire family from me for money?
I don't really wanna be alone. Can I stay with you?
there's nothing we can do.
you need to go in and say your good-byes.
they say we should carry our secrets to the grave.
but on the upper east side, secrets are the one thing you can never bury.
even when we think we know everything about the ones we love, there's always a skeleton in their walk-in closet.
thank you for seeing me on such short notice.
Mrs. Humphrey, in my business, there's rarely advance warning.
Oh, of course.
I just wanted to make sure all of mother's funeral arrangements were perfect.
she was very particular, liked things a certain way.
um, would it be possible for us to work with our own florist?
I'm... Sorry. I thought you knew.
your mother provided very detailed instructions.
in fact, if you return home right about now,
I think you'll discover the wake is already underway.
well, I can hear my mother laughing from beyond the grave.
I'm sure she just didn't want to bother you with making all the arrangements.
or she just didn't trust your taste level.
I'm the other daughter, Carol.
crashing as usual.
well, since you're here, you might want to know that it seems mother took care of everything in advance.
I'd tell you to invite your daughter-The real one, not the fake one.
but she's not speaking to you.
well, if you'll excuse me, I apparently have a wake to host.
aren't you gonna be late for work?
or you pulling a "vanilla sky"
and hiding your hideous disfigurement from your global publishing empire?
what? I thought you found my lacrosse injury sexy. No?
besides, I figured we could spend the day together and catch up.
no. No.
don't give me that "let's talk about our feelings" face.
what? This is normal face. Okay?
no, I'm worried about you.
in the past 72 hours, you found out that you have this entire secret family.
Yeah, and my mom hired an actress I know to play me.
I'm aware.
then why haven't you said a word about it?
I may not have known about the Van Der Woodsens for the last 19 years, but they sure knew about me.
and they didn't care, so that pretty much tells me everything I need to know about your fancy friends from the upper east side.
now buy a girl some breakfast?
all right.
two minutes. Get dressed. I'll make coffee.
how you holding up?
well, the past few days have been tough on everyone.
but I-I have a question. Are you with lola?
she hasn't been answering any of my calls or texts.
Yeah. She's not really that interested in being a rhodes right now.
well, trust me, I know what it's like to want distance from your family more than anyone.
but I thought maybe with Cece's death, she'd make an exception.
well, I'm not so sure.
the entire Van Der Woodsen clan on a good day can be pretty overwhelming.
well, I have an idea. Maybe...
you know, maybe she can just dip her toes in the water with just me?
I'm at my mom's right now. No one else is here.
they'll be at the funeral home for a while.
maybe the three of us can meet up.
I mean, I'll ask her. I just can't promise you anything.
thank you, nate.
coffee? Top drawer.
it relaxes me to watch Anita dust.
I did not need to know that.
what's got you in such a good mood?
I recently found out who actually sent "gossip girl" the now-infamous video of me and blair at the royal wedding - That hump, humphrey.
what, dan?
he was only too happy to let Serena and me take the fall so he could worm his way into Blair's broken heart.
unfortunately for him, when she finds out the truth, his chances with her will be destroyed, and she will be mine again.
I don't know, chuck. Are you sure you want to start world war Waldorf right now?
why wouldn't i?
cause you and I both know that nothing can actually happen between Dan and Blair for at least a year.
so... A lot can change in 12 months.
take the high road.
grab your coat. I'm kidnapping you and taking you to a bona fide Humphrey brunch.
bien sur. Merci. Nous parlerons demain.
so for those of us who took Italian, what was that all about?
that was Cyrus and another attorney at his firm.
they think they may have found a loophole in my prenup.
are you serious? - Yes.
apparently, since we signed it in Monaco but got married in the U.S.
you can contest it. - Oh, we can try.
Cyrus thinks the Grimaldis may have to grant me an amicable annulment, meaning that they'd waive my dowry...
and you wouldn't have to wait the year for...
anything.
when will Cyrus know for sure?
well, he's supposed to talk to the Grimaldis' royal attorney in an hour, so rain check on that waffle? I should wait here...
hopefully for the last time.
no.
delete. Delete.
what are you doing?
trying to help.
no, you're not.
if you were, you wouldn't let me slave in front of this computer all day as gossip girl.
well, I thought you said knowing everyone's secrets as gossip girl was your dream come true.
it was, until I realized how much work it is. I mean, look at me.
I'm exhausted and aggravated.
I have no social life to speak of.
I feel like a stay-at-home mom.
Oh, honey, don't say that.
it's true. I mean, all my life I've been the one that they write stories about, and now I'm just another anonymous shut-in with an online shopping addiction.
tell me, what can I do?
well... Since you asked, Georgina Sparks needs a recharge, so I've decided to take a mental health day, and I've found the perfect event to crash.
Cece Rhodes' secret wake.
what about "gossip girl"? The site can't go down all day.
it won't.
that's why i'm leaving you in charge.
don't worry. It's not rocket science.
you just take the tips that people send in and post them if they're worthy.
are you sure this is such a good idea?
Aw, what's a Van Der Woodsen family event if I'm not there to ruin it?
besides, I already promised a new friend I'd be her plus one.
thank you for coming with me.
I know I was invited, but, uh, I don't think I could face them all alone.
I understand.
when everybody at a party hates you, who better to bring than someone they hate even more?
what are you doing down here? I thought there was a family breakfast this morning.
Oh, there's a lot more than that going on upstairs.
I just came down to warn my mom. You'll see for yourself.
is Blair's houseboy up there?
you mean Dan?
is that why you came by - To get intel on him and Blair, torture him a little?
maybe just a little.
well, he's not here. At least, not yet.
but, um, here's some intel for you.
Blair just texted me that Cyrus may have found a loophole in her prenup, so she may be released sooner than any of us thought.
and right into Dan's waiting arms.
if you'll excuse me.
so what do you wanna do for breakfast?
Oh, I was thinking untitled at the Whitney - Danny Meyer's new place?
Oh, you're trying to score a cool point, aren't you?
and since we'll be on Madison anyway...
Oh, here it comes.
well, we'll be walking right by Serena's mom's, which serena will be at by herself, I might add.
Nate, what part of wanting nothing to do with the Van Der Woodsens don't you understand?
look, I know how you feel about them, but not everything from the upper east side is automatically bad.
okay. Name one thing that isn't.
me. Come on.
Serena's one of my best friends, okay?
you haven't even given her one shot. What's the harm?
all right, but if we stop by, you have to promise me that you're never gonna play me like this again, okay?
I promise.
mom, you knew grandma always did like to do things her own way.
I know. I'm just not entirely sure I'm in the mood for the "mayflower" mausoleum in mother's honor that obviously awaits us upstairs.
Oh, my god.
it was all here when I got home.
there's whiskey and stew...
and mother.
and those are our mourners' chairs where we will sit and mourn because this is an irish wake.
looks like this wake might end up being the wake-up call you so desperately need.
copy.
post.
uploading.
Oh, no.
I just can't believe that this was mother's idea.
and who are these people? I don't recognize a soul.
well, I guess Cece wanted us to celebrate her life and not mourn her death, so she didn't invite any of her stodgy socialites, just the...
the help.
that-that-that was her butcher from East Hampton, and her driver.
and the fireman that saved her life the night she left the candle burning.
you. What are you doing here?
I was invited by your mother herself.
I promised her I'd come.
I just came to pay my respects. I won't bother anybody.
this is all Carol's fault.
Yeah, I'm sure she's hiding here somewhere.
you can't let Carol get to you like this.
the executor of the estate is supposed to be coming, whoever that is.
my money is on Elias the gardener.
and I'm sure everything will be explained once they read the will.
well, whoever it is, they'd better get here soon, because I'm not responsible for what I might do.
so serena's here alone, huh?
I swear I had no idea what we were walking into.
so this is an epic fail.
Yeah, let's just go, before someone sees us.
Lola. May I have a word?
of course this is happening.
what is it, mother?
do you mind telling me what you're doing here?
Oh, yeah, well, let's see.
um, this morning, while I was in the shower at Nate's, Serena, the cousin I just found out about, tricked me into coming to the wake of the grandmother that I never knew existed at the house of the family that you hid from me for my entire life.
does that sum it up for you enough?
I know you blame me for everything, but I only lied to you because we're not safe around these people.
they're materialistic monsters.
Oh, says the woman who looted her own daughter's trust fund.
that money was for you.
you cannot believe a word these people say.
mom, the only person here who's ever lied to me is you.
I know this place is crazy, but I'm really glad you came.
I was just about to call you.
I know. I screwed up.
Yes, you did. Who knows if anyone will send in another tip ever?
luckily for you, I'm in the eye of the hurricane.
so I can watch your mess play out, and if this is my last day as gossip girl thanks to you, i'm going out with a bang.
Dan, I'm so sorry for your loss.
Hey, Dennis.
Georgina, I would ask you what you're doing here if I cared, which I don't, so...
I was just wondering if you had the chance to check "Gossip Girl" recently.
no. Why?
I know I promised I'd never publicly reveal that little video secret of yours, but unfortunately, I left Philip in charge.
so... Lesson learned. Okay. Bye.
Oh,"G. G. - it's time you told everyone dan humphrey sent in that video on blair's wedding day."
philip is rich, not bright.
I'm sorry, but keep reading.
Oh, my god. This was - This was sent in by...
how dare you?
of all your many, many attempts at sabotage, this is by far the most pathetic.
are you so worried that I'll find happiness without you that you feel the need to spread baseless lies at the wake of my best friend's grandmother?
while you may be correct about my motives, the blast is anything but a lie.
you know Serena and I didn't send the video, and it certainly wasn't Louis, so who's left?
I'm not playing this game.
why don't you tell that to your boyfriend over there?
or even better, ask him the truth.
Blair, please wait.
I have nothing to say to you. - I am so sorry I lied.
you didn't just lie, Humphrey.
you let me blame my best friend and my ex for something they didn't do.
you embarrassed me in front of 400 guests at my own wedding.
you made me the target of tabloids and T.S.A. Agents, not to mention, you helped lock the bars of my gilded cage.
am I forgetting anything?
I should have told you the truth right away, but I swear, I never meant to hurt you.
then what other reason could you have had to send in that video?
I spent every day leading up to the wedding listening to you say you had to marry Louis even though you didn't love him.
I couldn't stand to see you so unhappy.
I only thought it would stop the wedding.
I never thought you would leave it with me.
and us fighting like this is exactly what that Bass-face wanted.
but since Cyrus thinks everything will work out with the annulment...
what can I do? Is there anything? Just say the word, and I will
just shut up, Humphrey.
I forgive you... For now.
Estee? Did you follow me? I thought we weren't meeting till 4: 00.
Yes, after Cyrus tried to trick the royal attorney into voiding your prenup.
I know everything.
follow me.
looks like Blair's annulment just got annulled.
shame. You were so close, too.
let me assure you, your stepfather's plan will never work.
you slimy little limey.
I do not respond well to threats, and neither does Cyrus Rose.
he fought in 'nam. - You didn't let me finish.
his plan might not work, but mine can.
we can help each other, you and I.
go on. - You don't want Louis. That's clear.
but I do.
the prince and I... We're very close. We grew up together, but my station always prevented me from being a suitable choice for Her Serene Highness, at least.
until I came along. - Precisely.
you're a public relations disaster.
next to your Sarah Ferguson's swan dive, I'm Kate bloody Middleton.
so you think the Grimaldis will welcome Louis' loyal-and-loving social secretary as a replacement?
I know Louis would.
sorry.
no, no, it's fine.
oddly enough, I just want him to be happy.
then this is worth a shot, isn't it?
you have nothing to lose.
make the call.
so that's the tour. Thank you for coming by, or at least letting me trick you into coming by.
I assure you, Nate had no idea.
well, actually, he said we were going to a museum, so he wasn't that far off.
look, I know what your mom thinks about us, you know, how all we care about is money.
and the things you can buy.
but that couldn't be further from the truth.
family is what's most important to us, and to prove that to you,
I have two people who are gonna be so excited to see you.
you told me mother sold the limoges, and don't think I didn't notice her Georg Jensen service here, either.
tell Laryssa to count the silver right away.
I really appreciate everything you're trying to do, but, um...
I'm just not part of this world, and I don't really think I wanna be, either, so just tell Nate I had to go.
Oh, Lola.
I wasn't expecting to see you here. why?
even if I don't wanna be here, I have more of a reason than you do.
look, I know this sounds ridiculous, but the Van Der Woodsens are the closest thing I have to an actual family.
even though they hate me.
Yeah, I have the opposite problem.
maybe my mother really was trying to protect me.
by stealing all your money?
ladies... On the upper east side, money is never the real story.
it's usually just the "X" that marks the spot for what's buried beneath it.
if I were you two, I'd start digging.
what do you mean?
I know it's hard for you, but stop and think.
money doesn't explain why you hide your daughter for 18 years, unless she was being paid to do so, and judging by her hair and her clothes, i'd say that isn't so.
you think there's something else going on?
how do I find out?
well, nobody here is going to tell you.
you have to find someone from the outside, somebody who isn't afraid of them.
somebody like...
dad.
looks like there's a doctor in the house who's about to get a taste of his own medicine.
I'm so happy you're here. It would have meant so much to grandma.
I wouldn't miss this for the world.
I'm just sorry that Eric couldn't make it back from Zaire.
I think they call that the Democratic Republic of Congo now.
they do, but trust me, it's not.
Charlie, good to see you again.
Oh, you're a little late to the party, doctor.
that isn't your niece, but this is.
sorry?
