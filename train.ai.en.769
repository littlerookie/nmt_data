Thorin! -Come on!
Thorin!
hold on!

our plan's not gonna work. These furnaces are stone-cold.

Where's the sulphur? -You sure you know what are you doing?
come on!
now!
lead him to the gallery of the kings.
keep going, Bilbo!
you, think you can deceive me?
Barrel-rider.
you have come from Lake-town.
it is some sort of schemes hatched between these filthy Dwarves and those miserable tub-trading lakeman.
the sniveling cowards, with their long bows and black arrows.
perhaps it is time I pay them a visit. -No.
this isn't their fault. Wait, you cannot go to Lake-town!
you care about them, do you?
good.
and you can watch them die.
here! You witless worm!
you. -I am taking back what you stole.
you will take nothing from me, Dwarf.
I laid low your warriors of old, eye in still terror in the hearts of men.
I am King Under the Mountain.
this is not your kingdom, these are Dwarf lands.
this is Dwarf gold.
and we will have our revenge.
I will revenge, revenge!
I will show you revenge!
listen to me, you don't know what is coming?
I am fire.
I am...
death.
what have we done?
never Hear surf music again There must be some fuckin'chemical Chemical in your brain That makes us different from animals Makes us all the same Take it if it makes you numb Take it if it makes you come Take it if it makes you make it perfect Take it if it makes you talk Take it if it makes you cough Take it if it makes you forget verses Take it Take it Take it Take it

Hey! It's Friday night.

I'm just entering Canyonlands.
just me, the music and the night.
love it! - Just take it based on real story Take it Just take it Take it Just take it
Saturday
blue John Canyon.
guidebook says four and a half hours to the big-drop rappel.
I aim to take 45 minutes off that.
your face.
you looked like a dog. - I wish I was hiking with anyone else.
I don't know. I think we go that way.
but we went that way and had to come back.
you're doing Blue John too, huh?
uh, no, actually. We're headed for the dome.
but I think we're lost. - She's lost.
hang on.
Oh, my God. - God.
let's see this.
you are... here.
we are?
Oh, yeah. I knew that. I knew that.
and the dome is there.
um, I can take you that way if you like.
I'm sorry. The, uh... Friday the 13th there. Child-killer look.
I'm only a psychopath on weekdays.
and today's Saturday, so...
can't take this off. It's my face.
nice.
Aron. - Kristi.
allow me to introduce you to my friend Megan.
nice to meet you. - It's an honor.
what do you say?
you're lost. I'm a guide.
I'm good.
why not? - Sure.
all right. This way.
you biked from Horseshoe, huh?
what is that... like, 20 miles?
seventeen on the odometer.
Oh. Oh. I thought it was 17. 2.
uh, 17. 3 actually.
Ah, you're one of those.
I'm not one of those.
do you spend a lot of time out here?
it's my second home.
Ah, see?
there's the fork right there.
Aah. Okay, totally missed that.
glad we bumped into you. - Yeah.
what are the odds, considering we're all the way out here?
exactly. You go to the one place in America...
you're pretty much guaranteed not to run into a weirdo...
and what happens?
all right.
so the guidebook says that the route's through here.
but I know a better way... the cool way.
guaranteed best time you can have with your clothes on.
although it's better with your clothes off.
it is a bit of a climb.
we climb.
and a bit of a squeeze. - We squeeze.
so you get us all the way back in here...
and then you tell us that you are not a guide.
well, no. I'm an engineer. But this is what I really want to do.
Oh, that's wonderful.
I've always wanted to be a supermodel...
but I don't think that's actually really gonna work out, you know?
Jesus, what if these things move?
they've been here for millions of years. They're not gonna move.
Oh, sure they will. - What?
Yeah. Everything's moving all the time. - Oh!
let's just hope not today.
Oh. Great.
all right.
now all you gotta remember is that everything will be okay.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
what... - Where... Aron!
are you okay? Aron!
Aron!
home on the train Why'd you put my monkey on the train As you arrived My sleeping monkey is revived - Listen to the guy. He's fine. - Yeah.
he's batshit.
you're batshit!
come on! You gotta come down here!
trust me! - Trust you?
I'll kill you, Aron Ralston!
Oh, please. You love this.
nice job! - Oh, my God!
Megan! You're missing it! - Come on!
it's amazing!
fuck. Fuck. - Just jump!
Oh, my God. Fuck. - Just jump, Megan!
fuck.
Oh, shit!
are you okay?
nice jump. - Oh, my God.
I can't believe I just did that.
that's why we have to do it again. - Again? Again?
camera! Camera! - Camera? Camera!
camera!
so, Blue John is actually named after this guy, Blue John...
who was Butch Cassidy's cook...
Ah. That's cool. - From, you know, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.
the Hole-in-the-Wall Gang. - Yeah.
and they would hide out in these canyons, I guess.
but also what they'd do is they'd run horses... wild horses... into here...
and they'd trap 'em at the end of the canyons.
that's how they'd catch the horses.
you wanna take one more picture before I go?
Yeah. - Okay, cool.
ready?
blue John. Blue Cheese.
well, will I ever see you again?
that depends. Do you party?
do I party? Uh, yeah, sometimes.
tomorrow night, we're actually, seriously, throwing a party, if you wanna come.
Yeah. You should come by, have a beer, kick back.
okay. Where am I going?
it's about 20 miles away, near Green River.
you know the old motel? It's behind that.
there's gonna be a huge inflatable Scooby-Doo.
you can't miss it. - Really? Okay.
Yep. - Cool. - Okay.
it was good to meet you. See ya!
Bye! Scooby-Doo!
Yeah!
rock on!
you think he's actually gonna show up?
I don't think we figured in his day at all.
you liked him.
127 hours
this is insane!
fuck.
move this fucking rock!
please.
fuck.
fucking save it.
Oh, God.
Kristi!
Megan!
Kristi!
it's Aron!

Oh. Fuck.
shit.
Oh, God.

nice and dull.
Sunday
look at the size of this one, man.
like, how the fuck did this get here?
Yes.
okay.
cold...
Hey!
Hey, buddy.
here we go.
it's 3: 05...
on Sunday, April 27, 2003.
uh, this marks 24 hours of being stuck in Blue John Canyon...
right where it slots up before the big drop.
my name's Aron Ralston.
my parents are Donna and Larry Ralston of Englewood, Colorado.
whoever finds this can keep the... the recorder.
just please try and get in touch with my parents...
and-and give them this tape.
I'd appreciate it.
uh, I was descending Blue John yesterday...
uh, when this, uh, chockstone came loose...
and rolled onto my arm...
and now it's stuck.
um, the thumb is kind of this gray-blue color.
it's been without circulation for 24 hours.
so, I think it's pretty well gone.
I'm low on food.
that's about 300, 400 ml...
and that's it for water.
I'm in pretty deep doo-doo here.
Hello!
please!
there's someone down here!
help!
I'm in the canyon!
help!
help!
help!
help!
help! Help!
please!
help!
help!
down here!
help!
don't lose it.
Aron.
do not lose it.
not bad.
Oh, dinner.
tomorrow night, we're actually, seriously, throwing a party.
you should come by, have a beer, kick back.
there's gonna be a huge inflatable Scooby-Doo.
scooby-doo.
Scooby-Dooby-Doo, where are you We've got some work to do now - Scooby-Dooby-Doo, where are you - Where are you We need some help from you now Come on, Scooby-Doo, I see you - Hmm. Mountain Dew.
plastic cup.
thank you.
might take a beer as well.
don't mind if I do.
Scooby-Dooby-Doo, where are you
Hey. Aron here. Leave a message.
aron, it's Mom. I was hoping to catch you.
are you there?
Hello?
okay. Nothing urgent.
dad's in New York, so it'll be a quiet weekend.
call me, okay? Lots of love.
where you going? - Don't know yet.
right there, Brion.
maybe Utah. Maybe somewhere else.
have a good one.
always do.
always do.
let's go.
monday When I wake up in the morning, love And the sunlight hurts my eyes And something without warning Love Bears heavy on my mind Then I look at you And the world's all right with me Just one look at you
Oh, come on!
and I know it's gonna be A lovely day Lovely day, lovely day Lovely day, lovely day Lovely day, lovely day - Lovely day, lovely day - A lovely day Lovely day, lovely day Lovely day, lovely day Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day Lovely day When the day that lies ahead of me Seems impossible to face When someone else instead of me Always seems to know the way Then I look at you And the world's all right with me And I know it's gonna be A lovely day Lovely day, lovely day Lovely day, lovely day Lovely day, lovely day Lovely day, lovely...
crap.
this is freaking me out, looking at myself.
sorry. I hope that's okay.
it's Monday. Um.
bummer, all day.
I tried to set up this pulley all morning...
but it didn't work.
it was worth a try.
but there's too much friction.
and it's a climbing rope, so there's too much stretch.
what I could really use...
is about 20 meters of static wrap rope, 9. 8 mil.
uh, three or four pulleys...
a rack of carabiners, a sling...
power drill... and bolt kit.
Oh, and, uh, eight burly men to do all the hauling.
that should just about do it.
I have, uh...
about 150 milliliters of water left...
which should keep me alive till tomorrow night...
if I'm lucky.
I peed twice.
almost pissed my pants.
uh, I don't know, my body's acting really weird.
the second time, I did it in the CamelBak.
smells really bad.
but, uh, I'm sure it'll settle.
it's got to be chilled like sauvignon blanc.
no number twos.
which should disappoint my insect friends.
they'll just have to wait.
let's see, what else could I tell you?
there's this raven that comes every morning.
Hey.
I clocked it at 8: 17.
I'll... I'll film it for you tomorrow.
every morning at, uh, 9: 30...
I get 15 minutes of sunlight.
it's really nice.
I have been chipping away.
more to... More to keep warm than anything.
I'm beginning to think that my hand is supporting the rock.
so when I chip away a little bit...
it actually settles more.
so...
I found this great tourniquet.
it hasn't been very useful.
lesson:
don't buy the cheap, made-in-China multi-tool.
I tried to find my Swiss Army knife, but...
this thing came free with a flashlight.
the flashlight was a piece of shit too.
I kept it in my truck for emergencies.
not that I'm blaming you, Mom.
it was a perfectly great stocking stuffer.
and there's no way you could have ever known...
that I'd get in this kind of trouble.
when we watch this later, will the camera have to be on?
Yeah. So you have to leave the camera with us...
if we want to watch something that you've made, right?
Yeah. - Good job, honey.
isn't that great? - That is quite extraordinary.
so he's filming her now. - Sounds beautiful, sweetheart.
Yes. - We're seeing it now live...
but he's going to be able to show this again.
go away.
to be able to watch it. We can't just watch it with a...
so good.
well done. Okay.
way to go, Sis.
keep playing? - Yes, honey. Keep going.
fuck.
okay!
go!
I love you.
so...
how do I get in?
what's the, um...
you know? - Combination.
combination.
if I told you...
I'd have to kill you.
but already you kill me.
combination?
I think I have it.
fuck!
Ah, fuck.
fuck. Fuck.
sign come on, come on
who's there?
you can set me any task
Aron?
I'll do anything you ask - If you'll only Love me still If the sun should tumble From the sky If the sea should suddenly Run dry - If you love me - Please!
please!
really love me Let it happen I won't care - If it seems that everything is lost
please!
good morning, everybody out there. Steve.
good morning. - It's The Morning Show with Brian Stephenson...
also coming up this half hour...
good morning. This will get you going today.
good morning, everyone!
it is 7: 00 here in Canyonland, U. S.A.
and this morning on the boulder...
we have a very special guest...
self-proclaimed American superhero...
aron Ralston!
let's hear it for Aron!
Hi. Oh, gosh. It's...
it's a real pleasure to be here. Thank you. Thank you.
um... Hey, can I say hi to my mom and dad?
mom and Dad!
mustn't forget Mom and Dad. Right, Aron?
Yeah. That's right.
uh... Hey, Mom.
I'm really sorry l...
I didn't answer the phone the other night.
if I had, I would have told you where I was going, and then...
well, I probably wouldn't be here right now.
that's for sure!
but like I always say...
your supreme selfishness...
is our gain.
thank you, Aron. Anyone else you'd like to say hi to?
um... Well, Brion at work.
Hi, Aron! - Hey.
uh, I probably won't be making it into work today.
get a load of this guy! Oh, wait. Hold on.
we've got a question coming in from another Aron...
in Loser Canyon, Utah.
aron asks...
am I right in thinking...
that even if Brion from work...
notifies the police...
they'll put a 24-hour hold on it...
before they file a Missing Persons report?
which means you won't become officially missing...
until midday Wednesday, at the earliest!
Ah, yeah. You're right on the money there, Aron.
which means I'll probably be dead by then.
aron from Loser Canyon, Utah. How do you know so much?
well, I'll tell you how I know so much.
I volunteer for the rescue service.
you see, I'm something of a, uh...
well, a big fucking hard hero.
and I can do everything on my own, you see?
I do see.
now...
is it true that despite...
or maybe because you're a big fucking hard hero...
you didn't tell anyone where you were going?
Yeah, that's absolutely correct.
anyone? - Anyone.
oops!
Oops.
Oops.
mom, Dad.
I just want to take this time to tell you...
that the times we've spent together have been awesome.
and I haven't appreciated you in my heart... as I know that I could.
mom, I love you...
and I wish that I'd returned all your calls, ever.
I love you guys...
and I'll always be with you.
bone.
wednesday
it's no Slurpee.
it's like a bag of piss.
yahoo! - Nice!
come on, Ralston!
okay, I'm gonna go up again.
give me that.
quick, while he's gone.
listen. - We could tell him.
I know that. - Okay? Tell him.
we're very worried about you.
we're worried... - About your music.
your musical choices are really rough.
if you keep singing Phish, you're never gonna get a girlfriend.
never. - You might have one, but I really doubt that you do.
you may be sort of cute, occasionally. - I'm nervous and scared for you.
okay. This cannonball's for you. - No one will care.
okay.
that was a 10.
all right.
I'm going to test your theory...
about whether or not it's better to do it...
without your clothes on.
I'm just gonna swim for a bit.
don't.
no, no. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
Oh, please.
don't.
don't.
ralston, rock on.
Oh, fuck.
you don't even want me here, do you?
I'm gonna go, Aron.
is that what you want?
it is, isn't it?
okay.
come back.
you're gonna be so lonely, Aron.
you hear that, Aron? I'm coming!
um, I'm holding on.
time's moving really slowly.
my heart's beating really fast.
I swear to God, it feels like...
it feels like... - It's beating, like, three times as fast as it should be.
so cold.
so cold.
Hey.
blue John.
I... love... you.
there you are.
Rana. I've been thinking about you, girl.
I've been thinking about you, girl.
I admit it. I admit it.
I know how I am. I tried to do everything.
where I was. - I tried.
Aron? Where are you?
where are you?
what are you guys doing here?
Eddie? Tom?
Hey, you guys. What's going on?
Eric? Hey.
you look like the Hole-in-the-Wall Gang.
dorks.
found you, Aron.
sis, I'm sorry that I won't be at your wedding.
I know that I promised to play, that we'd play.
I'm sorry.
I know it'll be a good one.
8: 15. There's no raven.
8: 30. My raven didn't come.
I've been thinking.
everything is...
it just comes together.
you're gonna be so lonely, Aron.
have a good one. - Always do.
Laters!
it's me.
aron, it's Mom. I was hoping to catch you.
I chose this.
dad's in New York, so it'll be a quiet weekend.
I chose all of this.
call me, okay? Lots of love.
this rock.
this rock has been waiting for me my entire life.
I hate this rock!
in its entire life... - ever since it was a bit of meteorite... a million billion years ago...
how the fuck did this get here?
up there in space...
it's been waiting...
to come here...
right... right here.
I've been moving towards it my whole life.
the minute I was born, every breath I've taken...
every action...
has been leading me to this crack...
on the earth's surface.
rip
in your life, you're mad
in your course, you're sad
o" your taller now I've found
hold your fire course
o" your fallen out
go and sow your courses

there's more than this

this Saturday I was trapped by a boulder.
I haven't had food or water for five days.
this morning I cut my arm...
this morning I cut my arm off.
please. Some water?
thank you.
do you have a phone? - Yes, but no signal.
you should stop and rest.
no. I've gotta keep going.
can one of you run?
can one of you run ahead?
aron's premonition came true
he met his wife Jessica 3 years later
their son, Leo, was born in Feb 2010
aron continues to be a climber and canoyneer
he always leaves a note to say where he has gone
Nugent.
you're a prince.
the word is 5E, boys, 5E. - Got it.
then I start doing my research, doing my due diligence.
I found out, you know, it's good money in birthday cakes for kids, you know.
that type of thing, like Tweety Bird or Bugs Bunny or something like that.
or Yu-Gi-Oh! You ever heard of Yu-Gi-Oh!?
Yu-Gi-Oh! - Yu-Gi-Oh! Kids love that, man.
you don't know Yu-Gi-Oh!? You gotta get out more. Yu-Gi-Oh! Hot.
know what I'm saying?
I'm gonna make money, Jack. Open up my bakery.
you gonna eat your words about me, Jack. How do I look? Do I look all right?
all right. - Freeze! Police!
police! Police! - Shut up!
Oh, my God! - Shut up!
Frank, they gave us the wrong apartment.
put it down.
put it down.
can't get lucky all the time.
you can be smart every day, though.
all right, give me the gun. - Hold on.
what are you doing?
this place is crawling with cops, Eddie.
Hey, look at me.
Eddie, what are you doing?
how does it feel?
how does it feel?
you're a baker, right?
Eddie, listen to him.
pull that trigger, you go to jail for life.
Frank, we're on our way down.
Frank, do you read me?
you can't stop me, you understand? - Time to go.
time to go. - You can't stop me.
you gave him a loaded weapon?
Frank. - Bobby, get these things off me.
did he take your gun? - They went south. Get out of here.
Ortiz! Ortiz, give me a piece. Give me a piece! Get over here.

Bobby? - Gruber's on his way.
all right. We gotta get our stories straight, all right?
we're getting our stories straight?
Yeah, suit up.
thought we could handle this quickly and quietly, commissioner.
a guy shoots a cop, takes a grand-jury witness hostage...
...and we're supposed to make nice?
commissioner, look, sir, this is... Watch your back, sir.
this is my fault, all right?
I used to work with Mosley, so I asked the captain to let me handle it.
I felt that I could bring him in. I just didn't realize how far gone he was.
stay on Tac 2, boys. - Wait for command, here we go.
that's it, cover them up.
good, okay. Great job. Thank you.
commissioner, sir. Captain. - Hi, Mike.
what do we got? - Cop. Twenty plus, flipped.
suicidal? - Been to the farm twice the last four years.
twice? - Twice. Nothing like this, though.
what do you know, detective? - Like the captain said, he flipped.
after he nailed Shue, he started spouting crap about making headlines.
there's no way that you're getting this guy out.
please fall back behind the barricades. On the sidewalk.
smart cop.
okay. You're all gonna be okay. We're gonna get you out of here.
please, just move to the back of the bus. - Jack?
just move to the back of the bus, please, right now.
it's okay. You're gonna get off the bus. I am a police officer.
Jack, it's Mike Sheehan from HNT.
we worked that barricade deal on the concourse a few years ago.
I'm gonna put this thing down, okay?
I'm sorry. - Jack!
I'm sorry that I got you in this situation.
you know the drill, no weapons.
listen, you're on the job.
just keep your head down. - You know the deal.
I'm just gonna step in here, nice and easy...
...and hand you this phone so we can talk, okay?
make sure we got no injuries in there. Jack, just open the door, okay?
I need to... - Just throw it, Mike!
okay, you got it. - Throw it!
here you go. Jack...
Jack, can you hear me?
how many people you got in there, Jack?
count how many people are here.
everybody put your hands up, please.
N. Y. P.D. we got a situation here. We need you people back on the sidewalk.
stay behind the barricade. - Twenty-six, 28. Okay, thank you.
that's everybody? Please, don't cry, don't cry.
everything's gonna be all right, just relax. Stay calm, okay? Thank you.
what is it? - Thirty-one. Thirty-one.
okay, we have about 40 people on the bus.
okay, that's good.
you know, it's important that we're clear with each other, Jack.
ESU and HNT are in place.
the block is sealed, Jack. It's a frozen zone.
so let's work this out so everybody can go home, all right?
that's all we wanna do. Just end it, nice and easy.
Jack?
Jack? This is as far as you go, buddy.
keep talk...
is everybody okay? - Yeah.
Hi, how are you? - Good.
how are you?
my name's Eddie. Hi, how you doing? Everybody's okay?

and my strawberry recipe... I know I got one. Let me see.
Where's my strawberry recipe? Let's see.
Angel-food-cake recipe right here.
here we go, strawberry fan.

I can put a fan on the top.

I told you you was gonna get me shot.

all this started because my friend Maurice came by my house.
two days ago, Maurice came by my house.
he all excited.
he got a shoebox.
he had a gun.
he talking about, "Hold this for me for a little while.
I'm like, "I'm on parole." He like, "Me too.

thirty-one thousand dollars.
Jack, I got so nervous I ran out the house.
I went to Port Authority and I put the money in a locker.
I get back to my house...

...in my house.
he got Maurice's gun in his hand.
he looking at me like, "That's it, Eddie.
and he's talking about 15 years, man.
I got so sick.
then the DA came to my cell...
...and he showed me the picture of that cop.
then I met you.
Jack, they clean them lockers out every 24 hours.
I had a little schedule going, man.
court at 10: 00...
...Port Authority at 12.
Hey. Hey, look at me. Wake up.
you ain't gonna die on me, are you?
I don't know, I never died before.
it's not gonna happen today.
Hey. Thank you for coming.
what's going on? - Look. Shot here. I think it went in and out.
Yeah, let's get him in.
I know you.
come on. - I was at your house.
you were at my apartment? - Had to get my gun.
bigmouth.
it was very nice, very clean.
the police grilled me for an hour at the hospital.
What'd you say to them?
that you're a self-medicating, depressed individual.
and you don't care about anything or anyone.
Oh, she's honest, straightforward. That's sexy. I like that.
What'd you do this time, Jack?
he saved my life a couple times.
Hey, he's a good dude. You gotta give him another chance.
I don't know what he did, but you gotta give him another chance.
he gotta have somebody to talk to.
I'm not gonna be around.
Eddie, this is my sister, Diane. - What?
she's your sister?
Oh, man.
I just started having a little hope for you. Your family don't even like you.
I got a sister too.
but she live in Seattle.
I was supposed to go out there and start my bakery.
I was supposed to go out there today to see her.
see her on the bus.
I can stop the bleeding...
...but he's gotta get stitched up, get to a hospital.
we gotta be at the courthouse in less than 20.
you're gonna have to do it.
you're gonna be fine, Eddie. It's not as bad as it looks.
what happened to your hand?
I gotta ask you one more favor.
just a little favor.
Hey, is today really your birthday?
no.
no, I just said that because the little girl, she was so scared.
she was cute, man.
whers your birthday?
I don't know. - What do you mean, you don't know?
no, for real, I don't know.
I'm not... I came up in foster care. Had a lot of birthdays.
but didn't you say...? You got a sister, right? That you're going to see?
Yeah, I just found out about her a couple months ago.
never met your sister? - No.
that's why I'm going out to Seattle to meet her.
I'm looking forward.
maybe she turns out to look like Angelina Jolie.
shit, if she do, I hope she ain't my sister.
Hey, man, what you want on your cake, man?
you never told me. I gotta send you one, man.
I don't want no cake, Eddie. - Damn it, Jack, come on, man...
I can't think of anything that has happened in my life...
...that I would want written on a cake. - Nothing?
I'm not a good guy, Eddie.
I'm not a good guy.
Yeah, me neither.
Diane. - Frank.
give me the keys.

saving lives knows no bounds.
you should know that, Frank. - You look good.
you look a little desperate. Doesrt suit you.

Thanks, kid.

those guys you were gonna testify against...
...those cops? - Yeah?
I was one of them.
you were gonna testify against me too.
I did what they did.
we did some bad things.
I did another bad thing when I used you.
I was gonna let you do what I should have done.
what I should have had the courage to do six years ago.
I'm sorry.
you know, if you didn't come to get me today...
...l'd be dead right now.
right. - So...
I was supposed to meet you.
that was the sign.
you saved my life, kid.
take care of yourself, kid.
thank you.

Oh, yeah. You give the car keys to your best friend.

Wouldrt do that.
so...
...what do you think you're gonna tell them?
are you gonna tell them everything?
are you gonna tell them about you too?
you think that's gonna make you feel better?
nothing's gonna make me feel better.
then why?
look, Jack, you and me...
...we did our business in a certain way.
you never complained when we cleared the tough cases.
it didn't bother you doing any of that until...
listen to me, all right? You listen.
okay, Jack? Really listen.
whatever you think that you are gonna do up there...
...it is never gonna happen.
you are not gonna make it.

he was a stupid old man who wouldn't keep his mouth shut.
all right, so I stuck a gun in some guy's mouth.
he had a heart attack, he died. So what? - So what?
look, if it hadrt happened the way that it did, if he hadrt died...
...you would've been patting me on the back, saying, "Good job.
collateral damage, it is a fact of life in this business.
he took his last breaths while you were wiping the fingerprints off the room.
he was gonna take down our case. - He was an innocent man.

I hope you're doing well and everything worked out like it was supposed to.
I'm doing great.
Seattle is different, and I like it a lot.
I'm not sure I ever smelled fresh air before I got here. It's a trip.

I'm busting my ass, but I'm happy, though.
the bakery is now open. Three cheers.
I put my name first because I'm doing all the hard work.
these ovens are hot, man.

the guilt will suck you down to the bone.
stealing ain't worth it.

and, uh, try to make it all land in the receptacle.
when you're done, just leave it in here.
in case you need a little inspiration.
Hey, bigboy, what areyou doing?
Oh, yeah, you readyto party? Yeah, well, I'm here now.
Yeah! Yeah!
Oh, there you go!
good, come on. Come on!
Dr. Swann, call the operator.
excuse me. My husband and daughters were in an accident, and I was told to come here. What were their names?
Michael, Catherine and Laura Peck.
okay.
excuse me for a minute.
cris. What happened, sweetheart?
I don't know. They haven't told me anything yet.
it's gonna be all right. Yeah, everything will be okay. Don't worry.
okay, what is the most important question forsafe sex?
what time does your husband get home?
that's good, huh? Yeah.
his Highness has arrived.
let's see what he comes up with.
serve up that chili.
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
it's 7: 00. What areyou gonna make up this time-- traffic?
you preaching the word? The entire congregation has been waiting foryou.
it's your party, remember? What's wrong?
haveyou been drinking?
no. You didn't drink again, did you?
I just ran over a man and two girls.
you're lying, right?
I was driving home.
took a turn...
a little too quickly.
I didn't see them crossing.
Can'tyou go any faster?
baby, hold on.
I loveyou.
deep breath.
good.
Yourlungs are clear. - I got a question foryou.
Yeah. Whose heart do I have?
uh, I can't tellyou. It's hospital regulations.
J ust like the donor's family doesn't know your name either.
but you know. - [ Chuckles ] Yes.
this is your heart now. That's all that should matter to you.
I wanna know who saved my life. - Ifyou want, you can write...
an anonymous letter to the family through the donor's association.
personally, I think it's better that you don't know.
Mrs. Peck? I'm Dr. Jones.
what happened to my family? Please, sit down.
no, I-I'm okay. What happened?
well, your husband and your daughters were hit by a car, and we had to perform emergency surgery on your husband.
Yourhusband suffiered multiple skull fractures, and we had to remove blood clots from around the brain.
he's in critical condition, and we're concerned that he's showing low brain activity.
what? Is he gonna be all right?
we're doing the best we can.
and what about mydaughters?
Youryoungest daughter was brought in with severe bleeding.
she just wasn't able to get here in time.
I'm very sorry. They-- They both died in the accident.
no.
no. Oh, my-- Oh! Oh! Oh!
Oh, my God!
No! Oh, my God!
do-- Oh!
wh-- Where are they?
where-- Where are they?
Mrs. Peck, your girls are here, andyou can see them ifyou like, but
I wanna see them. Mrs. Peck, I wouldn't recommend it.
Oh, God, Daddy. Oh, Daddy!
I'm verysorry. Ifyou'll excuse us, we have to get back to Mr. Peck.
uh, I'm verysorry.
Oh, God! Oh!
we want dinner!
Marianne, we'd like some dinner in here!
tell Reverend John to stay. Make sure no one notices and get everyone to leave.
what happened? Trish, just do what I tell ya!
okay, baby. I t's gonna be okay.
I t's gonna be okay. Yeah.
come on. Start the truck up.
start the truck up. Pull it in. Come on, baby.
Hey, Jack.
what are you doing here, man?
J ust came to pick up my things, Brown.
why don't you let me buyyou a couple of beers?
I don't drink, Brown.
how about a Diet Coke?
you know, I've been talking to a buddy of mine about hooking you up with a job.
been telling him all aboutyou.
so, what doyou say, huh? I've been feeling shitty about what went down.
come on. I understand.
so, what doyou say?
as you know, the doctors did everything they could to save your husband's life, but he has shown no brain activity.
we're here to help you with some ofthe final decisions that need to be made.
we have a patient...
who is gravely ill.
I'm here to giveyou some information on organ donation.
areyou willing foryour husband to donate his heart?
can we discuss this anothertime? - I'm afraid not.
I can giveyou time to discuss it, but this is a decision that needs to be made soon.
Paul, the beeper.
it's the hospital.
I think they've got a heart.
Hello? Yes, I'm calling on behalf of Mr. Paul Rivers.
Yes.
okay. Yes, I understand.
where do I have to take him?
good luck, my love.
hello.
hello.
does your shoulder botheryou?
Why? Because I was watching you swim before, and you have a wide stroke.
ifyou bring it in tighter, you get a better glide.
thanks for the advice.
do you mind if I join you?
actually, I was just leaving. - Hereyou go.
maybe just until you finish?
no. Maybe next time.
did you know that eating alone can cause kidney damage? And that's bad.
well-- Okay, sorry.
Hello?
Hello, is Ana there?
what?
is Ana there? Hang on a sec.
telephone.
hello.
Hello?
who was that?
Hi, honey, I'm on myway home. Ifyou need me to pick up anything along the way, let me know.
look, Daddy, a pigeon! Girls, no, don't touch!
Laura, stop it. Gimme a call on my cell.
I'll see you in a bit. Bye.
did you go?
are they dead?
I'm gonna turn myself in.
John says nobodysawyou. Nobody.
they don't know the license plate or what kind of car. Some asshole even swears it was a cab.
Marianne, what would you do if these were our children? Tell me.
but they're not. It didn't happen to us.
no, it didn't happen to us.
it happened to me.
what the fuck doyou gain by turning yourselfin?
it's my duty, Marianne.
no, Jack, your duty is here with us.
with your family.
my duty's to God.
please. Marianne, get outta myway.
Oh, buddy, right there! Yes!
my turn.
I think I better go back to the hospital.
Hey, he deserves it. I thoughtyour doctorsaid you're not supposed to eat that.
I'm making up for lost time.
lost time, not lost pounds.
we're gonna have to sendyou back for liposuction.
well, here's to all those who didn't think I was going to die.
hear! Hear! Hear! Hear!
to the first day of my new life. Congratulations.
Cheers. It's good to have you home, man.
I knewyou'd make it. I toldyou.
I also have an announcement to make.
I wanted to tell you that Paul and I are going to be parents.
that's great. There's a scary thought-- Paul being a parent.
you kept this real quiet. - Have you told your parents yet?
we're going to be parents. We just don't know when yet.
I'm going to have an operation, and then we're going to try artificial insemination.
terrific. Terrific. Artificial insemination, huh?
professor, doyourfemale students know you no longer have lead in your pencil?
Hey! Come on!
play nice!
let's have more cake. Let's pass the cake around.
Mr. Donneaud? Mr. Rivers?
Yeah. Thanks for coming.
sorry I couldn't cancel this appointment, but the way I'm bowling today, probably should have.
have a seat here. Park it right there.
can I bring you something to eat?
I'm not hungry. Honey, you need to eat something.
I'm fine, Dad.
when your mother died, I thought I wasn't going to make it.
I felt the world was falling on me and that I was never going to get up.
but, sweetie, life goes on.
you know what I thought when Mom died?
I couldn't understand howyou could talk to people again.
howyou could laugh... again.
I couldn't understand howyou could playwith us.
and no-- no, that's a lie.
life does not just go on.
Louise is getting fat, don'tyou think?
she's done nothing but eat since Robert left her.
what? She looks okay toyou?
why did you tell everybody we're having a baby?
I wanted to share our plans with them.
Oh. That's what I mean, they're our plans.
why does everyone have to know our private life?
why the fuss? They're our best friends.
Yeah, but we haven't even talked about it.
Oh, we haven't? I thought this was more than settled.
things change, Mary.
something we have to think about.
I don't have anything to think about.
I've already made my decision.
would you help me with the glasses?
soyoung.
you want me to stay withyou tonight?
I'm okay. Thanks.
I just wanna be alone.
the police called.
they said you need to go and press charges.
I'll go with you ifyou want.
I'm not going to do anything.
Y-- This guywas-- was some ex-con.
areyou really gonna let him just walk the streets?
what doyou want me to do?
well, he ran over Michael and your daughters.
nothing I can do is going to bring them back.
doyou get that?
Hey, howyou doin'?
you found it okay? Yeah, I did.
the donor's name was Michael Peck. He was 37 years old.
an architect and married.
this is the authorization for transplant signed by his wife, Cristina Williams Peck.
I have a copy ofthe medical report ifyou care to see it.
and I also have the widow's phone number and address just in caseyou're interested.
how did Michael Peck die?
you might have seen it in the newspaper.
this guy named JackJordan ran over Mr. Peck and his two little girls...
october 10 at 6: 50p. m.
this JackJordan's a piece ofwork. He's been in and out ofjail since he was 1 6.
car thief, small-time crook, drugs, bad checks, alcoholism.
last time hewas in jail has only been a fewyears ago.
you feeling okay, Mr. Rivers?
this is whatyou wanted, isn't it?
okay, I just, um-- You want some water?
he was, uh, an architect.
what's the point in getting involved?
Mary, I wanna know who I am now.
I don't think that's the way to do it.
what is then?
look forit with me.
let's look ahead together, not behind.
damn it, Jack, it's your birthday and you didn't even have one drinkwith me.
why don'tyou come over to my place? I'm having a party.
Yeah, I bet they're all as boring as you are.
you'd be surprised. No, man, I'll pass.
listen, I'll call you later about that job, okay?
all right, man. All right.
Thankyou.
Hey, Brown, you should.
I will.
okay, now, we can schedule the surgery, um,
I could get you in as early as Monday.
Yeah. 9: 00 a. m?
what's the percentage chance that Marywill get pregnant?
well, I can't offieryou a real number on that.
um, you know, there's the damage from the abortion...
that wasn't handled properly-- the blockage
what abortion?
what abortion, Mary?
I can explain. Explain what?
there is an explanation. Uh-huh.
all that drama about artificial insemination.
kids' names.
you got pictures of ourfriends' babies all overthe place.
Why?
soyou can flush it down the fuckin' toilet?
we've been a fraud for a long time, Mary.
Oh, yeah? Why didn'tyou tell me that when you were sick, huh?
or did you expect one ofyour girlfriends to come and take care ofyou?
you came back becauseyou wanted to. Don't blame me for that.
I came back to take care ofyou because I loveyou.
or because you were feeling lonely.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I can't keep going like this.
the insemination, the child.
it's like we're trying to put a Band-Aid on something that's just been bled dry.
it's finished.
but it-- it isn't finished ifwe give it a chance and have this baby.
when we could have, you didn't want to.
we were separated, goddamn it! It's different now!
Yes, it's different.
we gonna go? You only know how to think aboutyourself.
close six!
well, thanks for finally seeing me.
they tell me you don't want to eat.
I'm not hungry.
Jack, Jesus didn't come to free us from pain.
he came to give us the strength to bear it.
maybe He wanted this pain for me.
no, He hadnothing to do with this. It was an accident.
no, it wasn't an accident.
Jesus chose me for this.
ask for the mercy ofJesus Christ.
if it was an accident, why do I have to ask for His mercy?
I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy.
I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.
don't be so prideful. That's a sin. - "And the fearful and unbelieving.

I gave Him mylife, and He betrayed me.
he put that fucking truck in my hand so I could carry out His will.

but hey, He didn't give me the strength to stay and save them.
don't blaspheme, you bastard! Christ had nothing to do with this!
God even knows when a single hair moves on your head.
and you taught me that.
we're gonna pray foryou, Jack.

please?
damn it.
you killed Tariq?
you can't let Father know.
he wants me dead, because I messed up with Debbie.
you were determined to kill him, to kill our own son.
nothing will stand in the way of what needs to be done-- not him, not you.
your father's following us.
what?
it was the only way I could save you.
Oh, God! Oh, God!
I think I got it.
this is really it. I can turn off the override and stop the remaining plants from melting down.
did the best I could, sir. I hope it works.
so do I.
Edgar, what's going on?
why are some of the reactors still not shutting down?
six of the reactors were immune to the kill sequence.
contact Bauer. Either he finds the people responsible for planning the override, or we're looking at a nuclear holocaust.
Bauer and Audrey Raines left here about five minutes ago.
Where'd they go?
Falstead Security.
you're going to need to set things up on your end.
when Jack Bauer and Audrey Raines are killed, CTU is going to know that someone inside leaked their location. Divert suspicion.
fine.
the override device maintains heat levels within the reactor. They can melt down every one of those power plants.
the man you saw when you were being held captive, right now he's our only lead.
stop there. I think that's him.
they're trying to seal us off.
well, shouldn't we call CTU?
no. CTU's gotta be compromised.
that's the only way they'd know we were here.
then who are you calling?
the only person I can trust right now.
I'm empty.
is there any chance this is a mistake?
for the remaining six nuclear reactors,
arch is taking longer to shut down.
no. I can recheck it.
those plants are firmly in the grip of the override, which has been sealed off.
we can't get at it.
did you send a list of the six affected cities to the President? Yes, sir.
what about evacuation procedures?
we've already alerted the National Guard.
we're just waiting to see how the President wants us to proceed.
miss Driscoll, President's ready.
okay, put him on.
Mr. President.
I understand we've been able to shut down 98 nuclear power plants.
Yes, sir, but as of now, it appears that our shut down order will not be effective with the six remaining reactors.
not going to be effective?
what exactly does that mean?
I'm afraid it means that we could have six nuclear disasters on our hands.
what are the casualty projections if all six plants melt down?
450, 000 deaths in the first 24 hours.
the long-range estimate's in the low millions, and that's not taking into account the resulting cancers and birth defects.
why were we able to shut down the other power plants, but not these six?
it's because they're still being controlled by the terrorists, sir.
you mean because of the override device that they stole today?
exactly.
we have to find the override device itself.
it's a prototype, and the terrorists have the only one in the world.
all right, then let's find it.
I'm going to order the evacuation of those six cities.
Jim, keep me posted.
Yes, Mr. President.
all right, let's get back to work.
Yeah.
Mr. Secretary, it's Jack.
don't let anyone know you're talking to me.
we got a problem.
I understand, Marcy.
let me see what I can do.
I have to take this call.
Yes, sir.
what's going on?
first off, sir, I want you to know that Audrey and I are safe, but there was an attempt made on our life at Falstead Security. What?
a group of assassins, well armed, well trained, took out our entire security detail.
you're gonna need to send a forensic unit over to identify the bodies, but I don't want anyone at CTU to know.
why not?
because I think someone over at CTU is complicit in the attack.
how do you know that?
sir, CTU is the only agency that knew where we were.
no one else had that information.
is one of Erin's people working with the terrorists?
Yes, I think so.
I just don't know who, but it's clear that they didn't want Audrey to make the I. D. of the man she saw when you guys were both being held.
I'm sending a Secret Service detail to pick you two up.
sir, please don't do that.
that's not the right thing to do here.
why not? I don't want anyone to know where we are.
that way, I know we'll be safe.
how do you want me to handle this?
remember the sequence we developed for the Melbourne situation?
Yes.
try that. I think it'll work.
okay.
sir, I've got to go. I'll get back to you as soon as I know we're safe.
Jack, take care of Audrey.
Yes, sir, I will.
you okay?
I'm almost getting used to this.
Yeah.
Tony, is it possible that we could have been followed?
no. We're clear.
where are we going?
we need to lay low for a while.
what kind of communication do you need?
a wi-fi and a hard line.
all right, we'll go back to my place.
okay.
thank you, Tony.
wait till you see it before you thank me.
no, I mean for picking us up, saving our lives.
I'm sure you're wondering what's going on.
not really, no.
something wrong?
what could be wrong?
I'm not in the federal prison anymore, thanks to you and President Palmer.
Michelle left me.
I...
you know what? Never mind.
why don't you tell me what this is all about?
you heard about Audrey and her father this morning.
Yeah.
we were at Falstead Security so Audrey could make an I. D. of a man she saw during the kidnapping.
I don't get it. Why?
the secretary's kidnapping was just a cover.
the terrorists' main objective is to gain control of American power plants from coast to coast.
the man that Audrey saw is our only lead.
I thought you weren't in the field anymore, Jack.
I'm not.
the secretary is my responsibility.
I got caught up in it.
Yeah, well, listen to me very carefully.
I don't want to get caught up in it.
so you do whatever you need to do at my place.
I'm staying out of it, all right?
understood.
today continues to be a challenge to the strength of the American spirit.
we have a condition in six cities across the United States in which nuclear power facilities may become unstable.
while we work to regain control over these facilities,
I am also asking our National Guard to assist local authorities to affect an immediate evacuation of those six cities.
this evacuation is only being issued for all persons living or working...
the President didn't mention the fact that there isn't enough time left for a complete evacuation.
if those reactors melt down, there are gonna be at least 50, 000 dead per city.
we still have time to try and find a way to prevent that.
I can tell you now, Erin, the chances of doing that from here are very low.
we have to find the people who have the override device.
what about the hospitals north of there?
all right. Keep checking.
called Dina's sister.
there's no answer.
all right, I'll take care of it.
you and Rafi go check the station again.
okay.
the Americans have been able to shut down most of the reactors.
how many are under our control?
six.
more than enough to break their will, but I'm gonna have to manage the override personally, make sure those six melt down on schedule.
is there anything I can do?
Yes.
take care of your mess.
don't worry, Madwan.
I give you my word.
my wife and son will be dead by the end of this day.
we have to get you to a hospital.
no. Your father knows I've been shot.
he'll be looking for us in all the hospitals.
well, we're going to have to take a chance.
mom, you're hurt.
I'll be okay.
you won't.
you need to get to a doctor.
I'm not afraid of father.
you should be.
he tried to kill me, and then he did this to you.
he is not my father anymore.
mom, please.
all right.
drop me off at an emergency room, but then you have to drive away.
no. Whatever happens, we're staying together.
Jackie, I'm running a filter for Driscoll.
could you baby-sit it for a sec?
I'll be right back. Sure.
Yes, Marianne.
I couldn't take your call.
I was in a meeting.
Jack Bauer and Audrey Raines are still alive.
my information was accurate.
Yes. The location was correct, but they survived the attack.
are they headed back to CTU?
I haven't heard anything.
Bauer didn't call in?
not that I'm aware of.
that doesn't make sense.
actually, it makes perfect sense.
Bauer knows there's been a security breach, and you can bet he's told someone here.
I gotta get out.
no, you are to stay in until we take care of Bauer and the woman.
what about me? I am not gonna spend the rest of my life in jail.
you'll be taken care of.
you know that. Now go.
there you are.
what do you need?
division is waiting for those projections.
well, they're ready to be sent.
well, then, send them.
Yeah.
sir, your assistant, Scott Borman, just arrived.
should I sent him in? Yeah.
Thanks.
Mr. Secretary, it's good to see you safe and sound, sir.
Thanks, Scott. Sit down.
is there a problem, sir?
there's a big problem.
someone inside CTU is leaking information to someone on the outside.
what do you need me to do?
I need you to go to Erin Driscoll.
tell her that Jack Bauer is no longer at Falstead Security, that he's watching the surveillance videos at an old CTU substation in Torrance.
anything about when Jack will call in?
when they identify the man that Audrey saw.
I take it Jack and Audrey are nowhere near the CTU substation.
right. I'm trying to flush out the mole.
then you'll need me to put a DOD Comsat envelope around this place.
and if anyone sends out a communication containing the information you planted, that's the spy.
Yes, sir.
let's go.
let's go.
watch your step.
the dog next door likes our yard.
well, here we are, home sweet home.
just stay here.
Oh, God!
who the hell are you?!
Hey, Jack, it's okay.
this is my friend Jen.
tell him to play with his guns outside.
I'm sorry.
excuse me.
I'm sorry.
what are you doing here, anyways?
I thought you were working.
I'm going in late.
this is Jack and his friend Audrey.
this is Jen.
Hi.
I-I saw you on TV today.
you're the daughter of the Secretary of Defense.
you and your old man were kidnapped this morning.
Yeah.
what's going on?
I'm helping them out with something.
could you be a little more specific?
we need to use Tony's computer.
what, they don't have computers where you work?
listen, babe, we have a situation here, all right?
they need to lie low for a little bit.
we can't let anybody know they're here, all right?
whatever. I'm leaving anyway.
Jen, you can't go anywhere.
why not?
we can't leave until Jack and Audrey take off.
we can't take a chance.
what kind of chance? I work at a bar.
I'm sorry, Jen. We're not gonna be long.
look, stay as long as you want.
I have a job. He doesn't.
Jen, can I talk to you for a second?
please?
sorry.
no, she seems real sweet.
look, we were fighting for our lives a few minutes ago, and if it hadn't been for Tony, we would have been dead.
now, I've been through a lot today, and I'm sure when this is all over, your boss will understand.
and if he doesn't?
I can have him killed.
knock yourself out.
thank you.
how are you guys making out with that?
good. I just have convert this so I can read it.
and then, hopefully, you can make an I. D. from the surveillance video.
I have some software for that. Let me dig it out.
Thanks.
: you told me about Tony, but I didn't know that Michelle left him.
Yeah, a few months after he got out of prison.
I thought he went to prison because of her.
he saved her life, and she paid him back by leaving him?
that's the way Tony sees it, too.
didn't happen exactly like that.
when Tony got out of prison, he was angry.
he couldn't get a job.
personally, I don't think he wanted one.
he started drinking.
he pushed her away.
what is she doing now?
deputy director over at Division.
I hope he can help us.
if he can, he will.
all right, here we go.
you got it, Tony?
Yeah, I got it right here.
Thanks.
we're in.
start the ball rolling with Driscoll?
Yep. Headed into her briefing now.
she's not gonna be happy when she finds out we're using her to flush out the mole.
I am surprised you felt the need to keep her in the dark about this one.
as long as there's a leak in CTU, we keep everyone in the dark.
make sure that you're online and that your databases are unlocked.
as soon as Jack sends in the image,
I need you to be able to move as quickly as possible to make this I. D. okay?
I don't understand why Jack's doing this at the old substation.
well, apparently there's technical reasons.
I didn't speak with him directly.
who did?
I did.
he also asked that his whereabouts be kept strictly internal until he contacts us.
all right, let's go.
old CTU substation in Torrance.
I remember this lady.
we saw him around here.
there he is.
you sure that's him?
Yes.
I'm gonna route this through the D. C. office.
Tony, she's on the phone.
we can't have her making calls.
we need the phone.
go to hell. I can't go to work.
I can't talk on the phone?
just give me the phone.
go to hell!
give me the damn phone!
go ahead.
Thanks.
this is Marcie.
Marcie, it's Jack.
I'm sending you the image we need I. D.'d.
we're ready to receive.
okay.
you positive this came from her system?
Yeah.
the voices were digitized and scrambled, but we were able to clean it up enough to make out the words "CTU substation.
Where's security?
they're on the way.
Thanks, Scott.
Yes, Mr. Secretary?
Erin, I'm sorry to report there's been a breach in CTU.
what?
the information Scott gave you about Jack is false.
what do you mean false?
Jack and Audrey were ambushed at Falstead Security.
they survived the attack, but it's clear that someone in this office gave them up.
with all due respect, sir, you knew about this and you didn't tell me?
being left out of the loop is not something you should be concerned about.
I assume you're telling me now because your sting operation yielded a result.
Yes, it did. Read that.
where is she?
she's being taken into custody.
join me.
miss Driscoll, what's going on?
go with these men.
what for?
you're under arrest, Gavin.
DRISCOLL: You've been passing classified information.
what?
what are you talking about?
take her to Holding.
miss Driscoll, what are you doing?
miss Driscoll, I haven't done anything.
miss Driscoll, this is a mistake.
what is happening?
can someone please tell me what is going on?
I didn't do anything, please!
get back to work.
I don't care how you divide up her files.
I just want everything off her system and then sent to me.
and enter new pass codes.
we can't just do this on your authority.
it's okay.
but he works for DOD, not CTU.
Yeah, well, he's the one that found the mole, right?
and Heller wants him to have joint authority.
finish up here and get back to station two.
the program we set up for the reactor is almost finished compiling.
can I see this?
sure.
what makes you so sure Sarah's the mole?
she was sending out encoded information about Jack Bauer.
I don't think she would compromise Bauer or the investigation.
that's how she was able to fool everybody, Edgar.
she's the last person you'd expect to do it.
all right, just get me those files.
it's right here.
2: 22 p. m. Message sent:
old CTU substation in Torrance.
this doesn't seem weird to you that she would leave it on her system like this?
she didn't just leave it; it was encrypted.
Yeah, with a Bainbridge algorithm.
come on, it's so old school, it's like saying, "Please decode me.
let's face it,
Sarah wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer.
please, Miss Driscoll...
I promise you, there's been some kind of mistake.
how could there be a mistake?
your system was isolated-- the message was sent from it while you were there. Somebody set me up.
that's the only explanation I can think of.
tell me how that's possible.
someone backed into my system through a subnet, planted something.
that's the first thing we checked.
none of them were compromised.
let's stop playing games.
thousands of people's lives are at stake!
where are the people who control the override?
I don't know. That's what I was working on.
who did you send the message about Jack to?
I didn't.
miss Driscoll...
I would never betray our country or endanger people's lives.
you know that.
was it the same contact who coordinated the attempt on Jack and Audrey's life at Falstead Security?
I don't know. It wasn't me.
I learned my lesson today with Sherrick, and I am no longer going to err on the side of caution in these interrogations.
do you get my meaning?
I don't know what to say.
Eric, no.
please don't do this.
Eric... Miss Driscoll...
please stop.
if you want it to stop, you tell me where the Dobson override is and who has it.
: I swear, I don't know anything.
wait.
there's got to be an explanation for this.
you got to give me some time to think.
talk to me, Sarah.
talk to me.
miss Driscoll...
I'm not a spy.
I'm not.
please believe me.
Driscoll, please.
I'm concerned.
do you think you can break her in time?
I can break her in time, if she's guilty.
according to Scott, there is no way that this could be a mistake.
I agree it's hard evidence, but I've known Sarah for eight months, and she doesn't fit the profile.
how do you want to handle it?
I'll watch for a few more minutes, then I'll go back in.
I'll brief Jack.
: Eric, please...
please.
what are you doing?
just checking the surveillance from later that night to see who he's talking to.
did you find anything?
no, not yet.
anybody want a beer?
I could use one.
this is Bauer.
Heller: We found our mole. Who is it?
Sarah Gavin, works in Comm.
is she working alone?
as far as we know.
okay, I'll call Marcie, tell her the CTU channels are open.
we'll start sharing data.
how's Audrey doing?
she's good, she's resting.
sir, I think now would be a good time to send someone to have her picked up.
we're at 21408 Kipling, North Hollywood.
what's there?
a friend.
I'll send the Secret Service.
thank you, sir.
your father's sending someone over to pick you up, take you back to CTU.
: okay.
don't you think you've made me miss enough TV today, Jack?
why didn't you ever call me?
for what?
I've been there.
I could help.
I'm considered a traitor to this country.
my wife left me.
so how are you gonna help me, huh, Jack?
Yeah.
look...
I owed you for getting me out of prison.
but today, I repaid that debt.
and to tell you the truth, all you do is remind me of a past I'm trying to forget.
so why don't you do me a favor.
do what you need to do here, and let's leave it at that,
all right?
Yep.
so, how did this happen?
I was working in the yard and... backed into a nail that sticks out of our gate.
: Oh.
this looks like a gunshot wound.
I'm afraid it was nothing that exciting, Doctor.
it was my fault.
I was supposed to fix that gate last week.
all right, you're gonna need a tetanus shot, then I'll stitch it up.
thank you, Doctor.
I'll be right back.
go watch him.
DINA: What's going on?
he said something to the nurse.
did he make a phone call?
not that I could see.
did she?
no.
good.
maybe it wouldn't be so bad if they called the police.
at least the police could protect us from father.
it would be bad to go to jail for the rest of our lives.
that's what would happen.
so where are we going to go after we leave here?
if we can get out of the city and stay somewhere for a couple of days,
I can arrange for us to get out of the country.
yeah?
Jack, it's Marcie. We got a match.
who is it?
name is Henry Powell.
I posted everything on that secure site.
hold on a second.
okay, I got it.
he's a computer consultant.
he used to work for McLennen-Forster.
wait a second, McLennen-Forster.
they're the defense contractors that designed the override devices controlling the power plants.
Yeah, well, he's not there anymore, but he freelances for them, and he's definitely still in L. A.
how do you know that? Because he's trying to leave the city.
we just found out he scheduled a chopper to meet him in Van Nuys in 15 minutes.
I thought all air traffic had been grounded.
it is. He must have some well-connected friends.
he got a special clearance.
son of a bitch. Where in Van Nuys?
the helipad at the Larchmont Building. Okay, I'm gonna want you to ground his flight but not until I get there.
I don't want him to see me coming.
Jack, they're here.
can you make it in time? I'm gonna try.
Audrey, get your things. We got to go.
agent Davis, Secret Service. Jack Bauer.
you're gonna take the secretary's daughter straight back to CTU.
those are our orders. Okay.
you got a car for me?
it's right over there.
thank you.
Audrey, they're ready.
this is Agent Davis. He's gonna take care of you. Okay.
be careful.
I will. You, too.
CTU, Patterson. This is Jack.
let me speak to Erin Driscoll.
Jack, I just got the file on Henry Powell.
I'm going through it now.
he's trying to leave the city.
I've got to get over to Van Nuys.
you want air backup?
no, I want to keep a low profile.
I don't want to spook him.
the soonest I can get you a ground package is 30 minutes.
that's gonna be too long.
when is his flight due to take off?
less than 15 minutes.
what do you want to do, Jack?
he's most likely on his own.
I'm gonna have to try and handle this myself.
all right.
I'll send a team anyway.
I'll be in touch.
what are you gonna try and handle by yourself?
don't worry about it. It's covered.
Jack, it'd be pretty stupid of me to let you die right after I risked my life trying to save you.
could you use my help?
Yeah.
all right, let's go.
Curtis. Yeah, Edgar?
has Sarah confessed to anything yet? No.
what are they doing to her?
don't worry about it.
just get back to work, all right?
Curtis? What did Edgar want?
why do you care?
well, you should let him know we need his full attention
get back to your station.
what's that?
just something to numb the arm so that I can close the wound.
I really wish you'd let me admit you.
this wound is serious.
there's a chance of an infection here.
no, Doctor, please.
do whatever you can, and we'll leave.
where are you going?
I'll be right back, Mom.
woman: Dr. Travis, you have a visitor in the main lobby.
Dr. Travis...
mom, the police are here.
did you call the police? This is a gunshot wound.
I told you it wasn't.
doctor: Then why are you acting so strangely?
let's go.
you shouldn't leave-- you need to be treated.
wait!
let's go!
come on... Come on!
what is it, Edgar?
about an hour ago, you asked me to bump up your security clearance.
I was a little busy with the override, but I finally got it for you.
great. Thank you.
what?
you'll need to pick a password.
I set up the screen on server five.
there you go.
you need to use the same password as the one that unlocks your system files.
why do you keep looking at me?
I don't keep looking at you.
let's go outside.
I want to talk to you in private.
I don't want to talk to you in private.
I have a lot of work to do.
it is getting incredibly tedious, Edgar, to have to remind you repeatedly that I could step into Driscoll's office any moment and have you fired.
Curtis, I need to talk to you.
what is it?
I need you to walk with me to Driscoll's office.
walk with you?
please, Curtis.
sorry to interrupt.
what is it?
you got the wrong person.
Sarah's not guilty of anything.
how do you know?
because I just sneaked into Marianne's system.
she used Sarah's to communicate outside of CTU, made it look like
Sarah was the one.
that's not possible.
Sarah's workstation was isolated from the subnet.
she didn't use the subnet.
how'd she get through?
she used a plain old AC power line.
what?
that's the last place anybody would ever look.
plus it has plenty of bandwidth to carry the signal.
where is she?
she's trying to leave the building.
lock down the exits.
you're under arrest.
examine the contents.
impound the car. Strip it and search it.
I got her.
Mr. Powell?
Yeah, let's go.
uh, sorry, sir, we can't.
what?
uh, flight's been grounded.
no. McLennan-Forster has special ordinance.
the paperwork was sent.
I know, but the order was superseded.
by who?
department of Defense.
you're going to fly me out of here.
please, sir.
now! Get in.
all right, where we going?
just get us in the air and fly east.
there it is.
do not take off!
do not take off!
go! Go! Hold on!
shut it down!
come on, go.
drop the weapon now. now!
shut it down.
get out of the helicopter now.
move!
get up!
move!
put your hands on the roof of the truck.
some people I know, they'll pay you.
shut up.
I got his cell phone.
bring me the bag.
put your hands behind your back.
who are you guys?
police? FBI?
actually, I'm currently unemployed.
I'll make it worth your while.
put him in the back.
come on.
he's dead, Jack.
damn it!
subtitles by Jaxdahl
you killed Tariq?
you can't let Father know.
he wants me dead, because I messed up with Debbie.
you were determined to kill him, to kill our own son.
nothing will stand in the way of what needs to be done-- not him, not you.
your father's following us.
what?
it was the only way I could save you.
Oh, God! Oh, God!
I think I got it.
this is really it. I can turn off the override and stop the remaining plants from melting down.
did the best I could, sir. I hope it works.
so do I.
Edgar, what's going on?
why are some of the reactors still not shutting down?
six of the reactors were immune to the kill sequence.
contact Bauer. Either he finds the people responsible for planning the override, or we're looking at a nuclear holocaust.
Bauer and Audrey Raines left here about five minutes ago.
Where'd they go?
Falstead Security.
you're going to need to set things up on your end.
when Jack Bauer and Audrey Raines are killed, CTU is going to know that someone inside leaked their location. Divert suspicion.
fine.
the override device maintains heat levels within the reactor. They can melt down every one of those power plants.
the man you saw when you were being held captive, right now he's our only lead.
stop there. I think that's him.
they're trying to seal us off.
well, shouldn't we call CTU?
no. CTU's gotta be compromised.
that's the only way they'd know we were here.
then who are you calling?
the only person I can trust right now.
I'm empty.
is there any chance this is a mistake?
for the remaining six nuclear reactors,
arch is taking longer to shut down.
no. I can recheck it.
those plants are firmly in the grip of the override, which has been sealed off.
we can't get at it.
did you send a list of the six affected cities to the President? Yes, sir.
what about evacuation procedures?
we've already alerted the National Guard.
we're just waiting to see how the President wants us to proceed.
miss Driscoll, President's ready.
okay, put him on.
Mr. President.
I understand we've been able to shut down 98 nuclear power plants.
Yes, sir, but as of now, it appears that our shut down order will not be effective with the six remaining reactors.
not going to be effective?
what exactly does that mean?
I'm afraid it means that we could have six nuclear disasters on our hands.
what are the casualty projections if all six plants melt down?
450, 000 deaths in the first 24 hours.
the long-range estimate's in the low millions, and that's not taking into account the resulting cancers and birth defects.
why were we able to shut down the other power plants, but not these six?
it's because they're still being controlled by the terrorists, sir.
you mean because of the override device that they stole today?
exactly.
we have to find the override device itself.
it's a prototype, and the terrorists have the only one in the world.
all right, then let's find it.
I'm going to order the evacuation of those six cities.
Jim, keep me posted.
Yes, Mr. President.
all right, let's get back to work.
Yeah.
Mr. Secretary, it's Jack.
don't let anyone know you're talking to me.
we got a problem.
I understand, Marcy.
let me see what I can do.
I have to take this call.
Yes, sir.
what's going on?
first off, sir, I want you to know that Audrey and I are safe, but there was an attempt made on our life at Falstead Security. What?
a group of assassins, well armed, well trained, took out our entire security detail.
you're gonna need to send a forensic unit over to identify the bodies, but I don't want anyone at CTU to know.
why not?
because I think someone over at CTU is complicit in the attack.
how do you know that?
sir, CTU is the only agency that knew where we were.
no one else had that information.
is one of Erin's people working with the terrorists?
Yes, I think so.
I just don't know who, but it's clear that they didn't want Audrey to make the I. D. of the man she saw when you guys were both being held.
I'm sending a Secret Service detail to pick you two up.
sir, please don't do that.
that's not the right thing to do here.
why not? I don't want anyone to know where we are.
that way, I know we'll be safe.
how do you want me to handle this?
remember the sequence we developed for the Melbourne situation?
Yes.
try that. I think it'll work.
okay.
sir, I've got to go. I'll get back to you as soon as I know we're safe.
Jack, take care of Audrey.
Yes, sir, I will.
you okay?
I'm almost getting used to this.
Yeah.
Tony, is it possible that we could have been followed?
no. We're clear.
where are we going?
we need to lay low for a while.
what kind of communication do you need?
a wi-fi and a hard line.
all right, we'll go back to my place.
okay.
thank you, Tony.
wait till you see it before you thank me.
no, I mean for picking us up, saving our lives.
I'm sure you're wondering what's going on.
not really, no.
something wrong?
what could be wrong?
I'm not in the federal prison anymore, thanks to you and President Palmer.
Michelle left me.
I...
you know what? Never mind.
why don't you tell me what this is all about?
you heard about Audrey and her father this morning.
Yeah.
we were at Falstead Security so Audrey could make an I. D. of a man she saw during the kidnapping.
I don't get it. Why?
the secretary's kidnapping was just a cover.
the terrorists' main objective is to gain control of American power plants from coast to coast.
the man that Audrey saw is our only lead.
I thought you weren't in the field anymore, Jack.
I'm not.
the secretary is my responsibility.
I got caught up in it.
Yeah, well, listen to me very carefully.
I don't want to get caught up in it.
so you do whatever you need to do at my place.
I'm staying out of it, all right?
understood.
today continues to be a challenge to the strength of the American spirit.
we have a condition in six cities across the United States in which nuclear power facilities may become unstable.
while we work to regain control over these facilities,
I am also asking our National Guard to assist local authorities to affect an immediate evacuation of those six cities.
this evacuation is only being issued for all persons living or working...
the President didn't mention the fact that there isn't enough time left for a complete evacuation.
if those reactors melt down, there are gonna be at least 50, 000 dead per city.
we still have time to try and find a way to prevent that.
I can tell you now, Erin, the chances of doing that from here are very low.
we have to find the people who have the override device.
what about the hospitals north of there?
all right. Keep checking.
called Dina's sister.
there's no answer.
all right, I'll take care of it.
you and Rafi go check the station again.
okay.
the Americans have been able to shut down most of the reactors.
how many are under our control?
six.
more than enough to break their will, but I'm gonna have to manage the override personally, make sure those six melt down on schedule.
is there anything I can do?
Yes.
take care of your mess.
don't worry, Madwan.
I give you my word.
my wife and son will be dead by the end of this day.
we have to get you to a hospital.
no. Your father knows I've been shot.
he'll be looking for us in all the hospitals.
well, we're going to have to take a chance.
mom, you're hurt.
I'll be okay.
you won't.
you need to get to a doctor.
I'm not afraid of father.
you should be.
he tried to kill me, and then he did this to you.
he is not my father anymore.
mom, please.
all right.
drop me off at an emergency room, but then you have to drive away.
no. Whatever happens, we're staying together.
Jackie, I'm running a filter for Driscoll.
could you baby-sit it for a sec?
I'll be right back. Sure.
Yes, Marianne.
I couldn't take your call.
I was in a meeting.
Jack Bauer and Audrey Raines are still alive.
my information was accurate.
Yes. The location was correct, but they survived the attack.
are they headed back to CTU?
I haven't heard anything.
Bauer didn't call in?
not that I'm aware of.
that doesn't make sense.
actually, it makes perfect sense.
Bauer knows there's been a security breach, and you can bet he's told someone here.
I gotta get out.
no, you are to stay in until we take care of Bauer and the woman.
what about me? I am not gonna spend the rest of my life in jail.
you'll be taken care of.
you know that. Now go.
there you are.
what do you need?
division is waiting for those projections.
well, they're ready to be sent.
well, then, send them.
Yeah.
sir, your assistant, Scott Borman, just arrived.
should I sent him in? Yeah.
Thanks.
Mr. Secretary, it's good to see you safe and sound, sir.
Thanks, Scott. Sit down.
is there a problem, sir?
there's a big problem.
someone inside CTU is leaking information to someone on the outside.
what do you need me to do?
I need you to go to Erin Driscoll.
tell her that Jack Bauer is no longer at Falstead Security, that he's watching the surveillance videos at an old CTU substation in Torrance.
anything about when Jack will call in?
when they identify the man that Audrey saw.
I take it Jack and Audrey are nowhere near the CTU substation.
right. I'm trying to flush out the mole.
then you'll need me to put a DOD Comsat envelope around this place.
and if anyone sends out a communication containing the information you planted, that's the spy.
Yes, sir.
let's go.
let's go.
watch your step.
the dog next door likes our yard.
well, here we are, home sweet home.
just stay here.
Oh, God!
who the hell are you?!
Hey, Jack, it's okay.
this is my friend Jen.
tell him to play with his guns outside.
I'm sorry.
excuse me.
I'm sorry.
what are you doing here, anyways?
I thought you were working.
I'm going in late.
this is Jack and his friend Audrey.
this is Jen.
Hi.
I-I saw you on TV today.
you're the daughter of the Secretary of Defense.
you and your old man were kidnapped this morning.
Yeah.
what's going on?
I'm helping them out with something.
could you be a little more specific?
we need to use Tony's computer.
what, they don't have computers where you work?
listen, babe, we have a situation here, all right?
they need to lie low for a little bit.
we can't let anybody know they're here, all right?
whatever. I'm leaving anyway.
Jen, you can't go anywhere.
why not?
we can't leave until Jack and Audrey take off.
we can't take a chance.
what kind of chance? I work at a bar.
I'm sorry, Jen. We're not gonna be long.
look, stay as long as you want.
I have a job. He doesn't.
Jen, can I talk to you for a second?
please?
sorry.
no, she seems real sweet.
look, we were fighting for our lives a few minutes ago, and if it hadn't been for Tony, we would have been dead.
now, I've been through a lot today, and I'm sure when this is all over, your boss will understand.
and if he doesn't?
I can have him killed.
knock yourself out.
thank you.
how are you guys making out with that?
good. I just have convert this so I can read it.
and then, hopefully, you can make an I. D. from the surveillance video.
I have some software for that. Let me dig it out.
Thanks.
: you told me about Tony, but I didn't know that Michelle left him.
Yeah, a few months after he got out of prison.
I thought he went to prison because of her.
he saved her life, and she paid him back by leaving him?
that's the way Tony sees it, too.
didn't happen exactly like that.
when Tony got out of prison, he was angry.
he couldn't get a job.
personally, I don't think he wanted one.
he started drinking.
he pushed her away.
what is she doing now?
deputy director over at Division.
I hope he can help us.
if he can, he will.
all right, here we go.
you got it, Tony?
Yeah, I got it right here.
Thanks.
we're in.
start the ball rolling with Driscoll?
Yep. Headed into her briefing now.
she's not gonna be happy when she finds out we're using her to flush out the mole.
I am surprised you felt the need to keep her in the dark about this one.
as long as there's a leak in CTU, we keep everyone in the dark.
make sure that you're online and that your databases are unlocked.
as soon as Jack sends in the image,
I need you to be able to move as quickly as possible to make this I. D. okay?
I don't understand why Jack's doing this at the old substation.
well, apparently there's technical reasons.
I didn't speak with him directly.
who did?
I did.
he also asked that his whereabouts be kept strictly internal until he contacts us.
all right, let's go.
old CTU substation in Torrance.
I remember this lady.
we saw him around here.
there he is.
you sure that's him?
Yes.
I'm gonna route this through the D. C. office.
Tony, she's on the phone.
we can't have her making calls.
we need the phone.
go to hell. I can't go to work.
I can't talk on the phone?
just give me the phone.
go to hell!
give me the damn phone!
go ahead.
Thanks.
this is Marcie.
Marcie, it's Jack.
I'm sending you the image we need I. D.'d.
we're ready to receive.
okay.
you positive this came from her system?
Yeah.
the voices were digitized and scrambled, but we were able to clean it up enough to make out the words "CTU substation.
Where's security?
they're on the way.
Thanks, Scott.
Yes, Mr. Secretary?
Erin, I'm sorry to report there's been a breach in CTU.
what?
the information Scott gave you about Jack is false.
what do you mean false?
Jack and Audrey were ambushed at Falstead Security.
they survived the attack, but it's clear that someone in this office gave them up.
with all due respect, sir, you knew about this and you didn't tell me?
being left out of the loop is not something you should be concerned about.
I assume you're telling me now because your sting operation yielded a result.
Yes, it did. Read that.
where is she?
she's being taken into custody.
join me.
miss Driscoll, what's going on?
go with these men.
what for?
you're under arrest, Gavin.
DRISCOLL: You've been passing classified information.
what?
what are you talking about?
take her to Holding.
miss Driscoll, what are you doing?
miss Driscoll, I haven't done anything.
miss Driscoll, this is a mistake.
what is happening?
can someone please tell me what is going on?
I didn't do anything, please!
get back to work.
I don't care how you divide up her files.
I just want everything off her system and then sent to me.
and enter new pass codes.
we can't just do this on your authority.
it's okay.
but he works for DOD, not CTU.
Yeah, well, he's the one that found the mole, right?
and Heller wants him to have joint authority.
finish up here and get back to station two.
the program we set up for the reactor is almost finished compiling.
can I see this?
sure.
what makes you so sure Sarah's the mole?
she was sending out encoded information about Jack Bauer.
I don't think she would compromise Bauer or the investigation.
that's how she was able to fool everybody, Edgar.
she's the last person you'd expect to do it.
all right, just get me those files.
it's right here.
2: 22 p. m. Message sent:
old CTU substation in Torrance.
this doesn't seem weird to you that she would leave it on her system like this?
she didn't just leave it; it was encrypted.
Yeah, with a Bainbridge algorithm.
come on, it's so old school, it's like saying, "Please decode me.
let's face it,
Sarah wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer.
please, Miss Driscoll...
I promise you, there's been some kind of mistake.
how could there be a mistake?
your system was isolated-- the message was sent from it while you were there. Somebody set me up.
that's the only explanation I can think of.
tell me how that's possible.
someone backed into my system through a subnet, planted something.
that's the first thing we checked.
none of them were compromised.
let's stop playing games.
thousands of people's lives are at stake!
where are the people who control the override?
I don't know. That's what I was working on.
who did you send the message about Jack to?
I didn't.
miss Driscoll...
I would never betray our country or endanger people's lives.
you know that.
was it the same contact who coordinated the attempt on Jack and Audrey's life at Falstead Security?
I don't know. It wasn't me.
I learned my lesson today with Sherrick, and I am no longer going to err on the side of caution in these interrogations.
do you get my meaning?
I don't know what to say.
Eric, no.
please don't do this.
Eric... Miss Driscoll...
please stop.
if you want it to stop, you tell me where the Dobson override is and who has it.
: I swear, I don't know anything.
wait.
there's got to be an explanation for this.
you got to give me some time to think.
talk to me, Sarah.
talk to me.
miss Driscoll...
I'm not a spy.
I'm not.
please believe me.
Driscoll, please.
I'm concerned.
do you think you can break her in time?
I can break her in time, if she's guilty.
according to Scott, there is no way that this could be a mistake.
I agree it's hard evidence, but I've known Sarah for eight months, and she doesn't fit the profile.
how do you want to handle it?
I'll watch for a few more minutes, then I'll go back in.
I'll brief Jack.
: Eric, please...
please.
what are you doing?
just checking the surveillance from later that night to see who he's talking to.
did you find anything?
no, not yet.
anybody want a beer?
I could use one.
this is Bauer.
Heller: We found our mole. Who is it?
Sarah Gavin, works in Comm.
is she working alone?
as far as we know.
okay, I'll call Marcie, tell her the CTU channels are open.
we'll start sharing data.
how's Audrey doing?
she's good, she's resting.
sir, I think now would be a good time to send someone to have her picked up.
we're at 21408 Kipling, North Hollywood.
what's there?
a friend.
I'll send the Secret Service.
thank you, sir.
your father's sending someone over to pick you up, take you back to CTU.
: okay.
don't you think you've made me miss enough TV today, Jack?
why didn't you ever call me?
for what?
I've been there.
I could help.
I'm considered a traitor to this country.
my wife left me.
so how are you gonna help me, huh, Jack?
Yeah.
look...
I owed you for getting me out of prison.
but today, I repaid that debt.
and to tell you the truth, all you do is remind me of a past I'm trying to forget.
so why don't you do me a favor.
do what you need to do here, and let's leave it at that,
all right?
Yep.
so, how did this happen?
I was working in the yard and... backed into a nail that sticks out of our gate.
: Oh.
this looks like a gunshot wound.
I'm afraid it was nothing that exciting, Doctor.
it was my fault.
I was supposed to fix that gate last week.
all right, you're gonna need a tetanus shot, then I'll stitch it up.
thank you, Doctor.
I'll be right back.
go watch him.
DINA: What's going on?
he said something to the nurse.
did he make a phone call?
not that I could see.
did she?
no.
good.
maybe it wouldn't be so bad if they called the police.
at least the police could protect us from father.
it would be bad to go to jail for the rest of our lives.
that's what would happen.
so where are we going to go after we leave here?
if we can get out of the city and stay somewhere for a couple of days,
I can arrange for us to get out of the country.
yeah?
Jack, it's Marcie. We got a match.
who is it?
name is Henry Powell.
I posted everything on that secure site.
hold on a second.
okay, I got it.
he's a computer consultant.
he used to work for McLennen-Forster.
wait a second, McLennen-Forster.
they're the defense contractors that designed the override devices controlling the power plants.
Yeah, well, he's not there anymore, but he freelances for them, and he's definitely still in L. A.
how do you know that? Because he's trying to leave the city.
we just found out he scheduled a chopper to meet him in Van Nuys in 15 minutes.
I thought all air traffic had been grounded.
it is. He must have some well-connected friends.
he got a special clearance.
son of a bitch. Where in Van Nuys?
the helipad at the Larchmont Building. Okay, I'm gonna want you to ground his flight but not until I get there.
I don't want him to see me coming.
Jack, they're here.
can you make it in time? I'm gonna try.
Audrey, get your things. We got to go.
agent Davis, Secret Service. Jack Bauer.
you're gonna take the secretary's daughter straight back to CTU.
those are our orders. Okay.
you got a car for me?
it's right over there.
thank you.
Audrey, they're ready.
this is Agent Davis. He's gonna take care of you. Okay.
be careful.
I will. You, too.
CTU, Patterson. This is Jack.
let me speak to Erin Driscoll.
Jack, I just got the file on Henry Powell.
I'm going through it now.
he's trying to leave the city.
I've got to get over to Van Nuys.
you want air backup?
no, I want to keep a low profile.
I don't want to spook him.
the soonest I can get you a ground package is 30 minutes.
that's gonna be too long.
when is his flight due to take off?
less than 15 minutes.
what do you want to do, Jack?
he's most likely on his own.
I'm gonna have to try and handle this myself.
all right.
I'll send a team anyway.
I'll be in touch.
what are you gonna try and handle by yourself?
don't worry about it. It's covered.
Jack, it'd be pretty stupid of me to let you die right after I risked my life trying to save you.
could you use my help?
Yeah.
all right, let's go.
Curtis. Yeah, Edgar?
has Sarah confessed to anything yet? No.
what are they doing to her?
don't worry about it.
just get back to work, all right?
Curtis? What did Edgar want?
why do you care?
well, you should let him know we need his full attention
get back to your station.
what's that?
just something to numb the arm so that I can close the wound.
I really wish you'd let me admit you.
this wound is serious.
there's a chance of an infection here.
no, Doctor, please.
do whatever you can, and we'll leave.
where are you going?
I'll be right back, Mom.
woman: Dr. Travis, you have a visitor in the main lobby.
Dr. Travis...
mom, the police are here.
did you call the police? This is a gunshot wound.
I told you it wasn't.
doctor: Then why are you acting so strangely?
let's go.
you shouldn't leave-- you need to be treated.
wait!
let's go!
come on... Come on!
what is it, Edgar?
about an hour ago, you asked me to bump up your security clearance.
I was a little busy with the override, but I finally got it for you.
great. Thank you.
what?
you'll need to pick a password.
I set up the screen on server five.
there you go.
you need to use the same password as the one that unlocks your system files.
why do you keep looking at me?
I don't keep looking at you.
let's go outside.
I want to talk to you in private.
I don't want to talk to you in private.
I have a lot of work to do.
it is getting incredibly tedious, Edgar, to have to remind you repeatedly that I could step into Driscoll's office any moment and have you fired.
Curtis, I need to talk to you.
what is it?
I need you to walk with me to Driscoll's office.
walk with you?
please, Curtis.
sorry to interrupt.
what is it?
you got the wrong person.
Sarah's not guilty of anything.
how do you know?
because I just sneaked into Marianne's system.
she used Sarah's to communicate outside of CTU, made it look like
Sarah was the one.
that's not possible.
Sarah's workstation was isolated from the subnet.
she didn't use the subnet.
how'd she get through?
she used a plain old AC power line.
what?
that's the last place anybody would ever look.
plus it has plenty of bandwidth to carry the signal.
where is she?
she's trying to leave the building.
lock down the exits.
you're under arrest.
examine the contents.
impound the car. Strip it and search it.
I got her.
Mr. Powell?
Yeah, let's go.
uh, sorry, sir, we can't.
what?
uh, flight's been grounded.
no. McLennan-Forster has special ordinance.
the paperwork was sent.
I know, but the order was superseded.
by who?
department of Defense.
you're going to fly me out of here.
please, sir.
now! Get in.
all right, where we going?
just get us in the air and fly east.
there it is.
do not take off!
do not take off!
go! Go! Hold on!
shut it down!
come on, go.
drop the weapon now. now!
shut it down.
get out of the helicopter now.
move!
get up!
move!
put your hands on the roof of the truck.
some people I know, they'll pay you.
shut up.
I got his cell phone.
bring me the bag.
put your hands behind your back.
who are you guys?
police? FBI?
actually, I'm currently unemployed.
I'll make it worth your while.
put him in the back.
come on.
he's dead, Jack.
damn it!
subtitles by Jaxdahl
I'm going to have to manage the override personally, make sure those six meltdown on schedule.
is there anything I can do?
take care of your mess.
I give you my word, my wife and son will be dead by the end of this day.
I'm not afraid of Father.
you should be.
he tried to kill me and then he did this to you.
you're going to need to set things up on your end.
all right, what do I do?
divert suspicion.
someone inside CTU is leaking information to someone on the outside.
ms. Driscoll, what's going on?
you're under arrest, Gavin.
for what?
passing classified information.
thousands of people's lives are at stake.
where are the people who control the override?
I swear, I don't know anything.
DRISCOLL: We've got a match, Jack.
his name is Henry Powell.
he's a computer consultant, that used to work for McLennen-Forster.
they're the defense contractors that designed the override devices controlling the power plants.
you're going to fly me out of here.
drop the weapon now! Now!
put him in the back.
he's dead, Jack.
damn it!
you've got the wrong person.
Sarah's not guilty of anything.
it's Maryanne Taylor.
you're under arrest.
not now.
I warned you about her.
what are you talking about?
I told you she was trouble and it was a mistake to let her work here. No.
you told me that you weren't comfortable working with her.
you didn't tell me you were having a relationship with a corporate spy.
how could I have possibly known that, Erin?
don't play that card with me.
fine, then don't walk in here with an I-told-you-so attitude.
because now we both have to deal with this.
you mean division? That's right.
they're going to want a complete timeline.
everything from how Maryanne got through the front door, down to the high-security files in a very short period of time.
can we have a conversation off book?
go ahead.
there's no point in either of us compromising our authority in the eyes of division.
agree or disagree?
agreed.
Maryanne did an excellent job in establishing her credentials.
all we need to do is leave out some of the details in how she managed to leverage her way in here.
I don't like anyone holding something over me.
neither do I.
how long will it take you to adjust the files?
two minutes.
I'll call division at 5: 00.
explain to me how this mole-- Maryanne Taylor was able to infiltrate CTU.
we're still investigating, Mr. President.
who does she work for? We don't know.
find out.
we will, as soon as she regains consciousness.
she's being treated here in the clinic.
treated for what?
an attempt on her life.
who tried to kill her?
we don't know that either.
but whoever it was, they're more than likely connected with the theft of the override.
Jim, we need to find that override now.
what's the latest from the NRC?
they just reported the San Gabriel Island reactor is about to go critical.
what's the timeframe?
a meltdown within the hour.
we started evacuating the San Gabriel zone.
the population affected is less than 100, 000.
hopefully most of them are already on the move.
all right.
expedite the process as much as you can.
Yes, sir.
Erin, Powell's dead.
he was hit by a sniper as soon as we took him into custody.
get anything from him before he was killed?
no, but I managed to get the last ten calls he made off his cell phone.
he called two numbers repeatedly.
through caller ID, we traced one of them to Maryanne Taylor.
Powell was working with Maryanne?
apparently.
what about this other number?
hold on. I'm going to need you to trace it through CTU.
okay, go ahead.
I'll get back to you as soon as I've got an ID.
I'll be standing by.
Edgar, I need you to run a locate on this number.
it's a cellular account.
can you trace the location?
I need to ping the number. How?
it needs to ring at least four times before I can triangulate the coordinates.
Jameson can have me set up in a couple of minutes.
woman: Who is it?
what are you doing here?
I'm looking for Dina.
well, Dina's not here. Why would she be?
she hasn't called you in the last hour?
no. What's going on, Navi?
why are you blocking the door?
I'm not.
let me in.
I told you, she's not here.
you're lying. You're hiding her.
no, I'm not. Navi, no.
you have no right to come in here like this!
she is not here.
go. Look.
that is my bedroom.
you can't go in there.
what the hell is going on here?
nothing, it's okay.
Navi, please. Please, go.
look, pal, this is none of your business, all right?
so why don't you hike it on out of here? Please, don't interfere.
you can either walk out of here or I'm going to throw you out.
I said, go!
no, Navi, please, no.
Navi, don't, please.
get back inside.
don't tell my husband. I beg of you.
you disgust me.
Dina's not here. What about the hospitals?
man: Nothing so far.
keep looking.
is it your father?
I can't tell.
don't answer it.
we got it.
where?
a hotel in Chatsworth.
download the coordinates to Jack's PDA.
here's our backup.
DRISCOLL: We traced the call
we're sending it to you now.
hold on a second.
okay, I got it.
we're less than ten minutes out.
I'll have a tactical team
the body is over there by my car.
he was taken out by a sniper from the north roof.
I want you to take your photographs and get the body back to CTU as fast as possible.
come on, Tony, we've got to go.
wait, Jack.
look, uh, I think I'm done here today.
what are you talking about?
CTU backup's here. You don't need me anymore.
I need you to see this through with me.
I appreciate the sentiment, Jack, but you don't have to prop up my ego.
Tony, this isn't about you.
if we don't find the override device within an hour, we're going to have six major nuclear disasters.
so please, get in the car. Let's go.
mom, we've got to get you some help.
I'm okay.
I'm sorry.
this is my fault.
your father shot me, not you.
because you were trying to stop him from killing me.
everything that's happening today, what we've all been fighting to achieve, it's more important to him than anything or anyone.
but not to you.
mom?
I need to get you something for the pain.
I'll be fine.
I just need to rest.
I can get it from Nasim.
no.
the hospital he works at is right near here.
I'll be right back.
Nasim doesn't know why we were really living here.
mom, he's your brother.
I'll tell him you need it and nothing else.
I promise. I'll be right back.
just hurry.
I will.
Mr. Secretary, we have a meltdown.
the San Gabriel Island reactor has just gone critical.
the core material is now airborne.
I thought we had more time.
ms. Driscoll, I have Derrick Ross with the engineer at San Gabriel Island on with the NRC.
one of their generators exploded, it cooked their com lines, so the feed is unstable.
we may only have a few seconds.
patch us in.
what's going on? We've had a meltdown
all attempts to contain the core have failed.
right now my men are trying to bypass the reactor trip, but that's not working either.
Mr. Rosner, this is Erin Driscoll from CTU. Can you hear me?
Yes, ma'am, I can.
I'm here with Secretary of Defense James Heller.
what are your radiation levels?
we're at 500 rem right now.
that's 10, 000 times the dose of an X ray.
at this rem rate, the radiation will continue getting stronger and will spill into the atmosphere until the core has exhausted itself.
son, you've done everything you can, now get the hell out of there.
evacuating won't make any difference, sir.
we've already been exposed.
we lost them.
have we analyzed the radiation cloud's movement?
we're still waiting for NGS to get a weather satellite for us.
get on the phone and have them expedite it.
I will, as soon as I'm done rerouting these evacuation instructions.
can't someone else do that?
no, sir, I'm short of manpower.
a government spokesman has just confirmed that the nuclear reactor at San Gabriel Island is in full meltdown.
emergency personnel are on site attempting to rescue workers exposed to radiation.
several people have been taken...
you're not listening to me.
I've been trying to get through to a number in the San Gabriel evacuation zone for ten minutes.
I need you to link me in to access the emergency bandwidth, and I need you to do it now.
all right, standby.
thank you.
woman: Hello?
EDGAR: Mom.
Oh, hello, Edgar.
have you seen the news?
Yes, I'm watching it now.
then why haven't you evacuated by now?
what are you still doing home?
you know I don't have a car.
Where's Margaret?
well, I've tried to get hold of her, but the lines are all busy.
I'm surprised you got through.
what about one of your neighbors?
can't you get a ride from one of them?
no. By the time I got outside they were all gone.
mom, listen to me.
I'm going to make some calls.
I'm going to get someone there to help you, okay?
I want you to sit by the phone and wait for my call.
can you do that?
Yes, I don't really have a choice.
I'll call you back, okay?
okay, honey. Bye.
no, we delegated that whole situation to Murphy's group, sir.
Heller: I'm not interested in who got it wrong.
we don't have the luxury of miscommunications.
I'm assigning someone from my office to coordinate between the State Police and the National Guard.
set up the conference call in ten minutes.
thank you all.
are you okay?
Yeah. How are you holding up?
considering the situation we're in...
I'm doing fine.
the truth of the matter is, we do not have the manpower to handle this mess.
tell me what I can do.
I've prioritized evacuation protocol, but I need someone to keep the State Police and the National Guard from bumping in to each other.
all right.
I'll stop the Guard at the 75th mile marker and let the police take over from there.
that'll maximize room for civilian traffic.
I wish we had some other way to get those people out of there.
there's nowhere else to route them.
Jack has got to find the override before the rest of these reactors go critical.
good to have you in the field again.
Thanks, Lee. You remember Tony Almeida?
Yeah.
I don't know what he's doing here, though.
I want him here.
lee: He's not authorized to be in the field.
I'm going through that door first.
I want him there to back me up.
fine.
get another vest.
you got a visual on the suspect?
we've got a fiber optic camera inside the room.
according to the manager, we're grabbing a mid-40s female and a teenage male.
possibly mother and son, both Middle-Eastern.
okay, we need the suspects alive.
they're no good to us dead.
I've been briefed.
let's go.
agent Castle, we've got a visual on the woman.
what about the kid?
I haven't seen him yet.
we got to go, now.
you ready?
go.
don't move!
drop the weapon!
where is the override?
tell me who's got it!
tell me!
now!
agent Castle, stand down!
agent Castle, please stand down!
get off her!
we've got to get her to talk.
she's going to go into shock before she does. Just relax!
agent Castle, step outside now!
I want her prints and photographs.
send them over to CTU immediately.
he has no right to give me orders.
Hey, come here.
he did the right thing.
that woman was willing to kill herself.
she'd die before she gave us anything through force.
we need to get her to talk before the other reactors go critical.
and we will.
what did you have in mind?
we need to find some leverage.
Yeah, it's Jack. Put me through to Erin.
come here. Come here.
let me see your arm.
Erin, we've got a suspect.
I'm sending you fingerprints and photographs.
I need you to run a profile and send me all relevant databases and electronic communications.
got it.
thank you.
Hey, I understand your concerns about Almeida, but for me, please, just give him a break.
Thanks.
Jack: Yeah?
this is a bullet wound.
probably a couple hours old.
excuse me.
uncle Nasim.
are you all right?
Yeah, I think so.
Yeah, it's a disaster what's happening today.
everyone's panicked about radiation poisoning.
they all want iodine pills and we're almost out.
is that why you're here?
no.
I need pain medication.
it's for my mother.
she couldn't reach her doctor by phone, so she wanted me to get it from you.
what's wrong with her?
it's her back. She can barely walk.
she needs a prescription.
I told you.
she couldn't reach her doctor.
I'll see what I can do, okay?
just have a seat.
yes?
Navi, it's Nasim.
Hello, Nasim, how are you?
I'm well, but Behrooz just showed up at the hospital.
he seems disturbed.
is Dina there too?
no, he says he needs pain medication for her.
that there's something wrong with her back, but he's acting very strange.
I'm sorry you have to be involved in this, Nasim.
involved in what? What's going on?
Behrooz may be taking drugs.
he's been getting worse.
I'm sorry.
me, too.
what do you want me to do?
keep Behrooz there until I can come for him.
how long will you be?
15 minutes.
I'll do my best, but...
please, Nasim, don't let him leave until I get there.
excuse me, Miss Raines.
I'm Edgar Stiles. Sorry.
we've got a major noncompliance problem.
I've got 25% of the evacuees who aren't going where they're being told to go, and another 25% that don't even know that they're in the evac zone.
however you need to do it, make sure it gets done.
I'm sorry, what is it?
it's my mother. Your mother?
she lives near San Gabriel Island.
she's in a wheelchair. She doesn't drive.
she missed her call to evacuate.
now I don't know what to do.
maybe someone from the National Guard can get her.
I already spoke to the area commander.
he said he couldn't spare anyone.
I'm sorry, I'm not sure what I can do.
here's his number.
I thought maybe if you called him yourself.
look, I hate asking for special treatment.
that's not something I would normally do, but she's my mother.
I can't make any promises.
just promise me you'll try, okay?
all right.
I want you to give her something for the pain, but make sure she stays lucid. Understand?
did you find out who she is yet?
Yeah.
her name is Dina Araz. She immigrated to the United States five years ago, became a citizen two years ago.
married to a Navi Araz.
he's also a naturalized citizen.
owns an electronics store in Carson.
they have one son, Behrooz, 17, a junior at the local high school.
none of them have criminal records.
they pop up on any watch lists?
no, they must have slipped under the radar.
let's send some teams over to the house and the store, see what we can find.
yeah?
Jack, it's Driscoll.
homeland Security has...
hold on, Erin. I can barely hear you.
go ahead.
after the attack this morning, Homeland Security has been archiving select communications in the L. A. area.
they pulled up a call that may explain how Dina Araz got shot.
Erin, I'm going to put you on speaker phone. Hold on a second.
you're on.
this conversation happened about two hours ago between the mother and the son.
BEHROOZ: He wants me dead because I messed up with Debbie.
DINA: Behrooz, that's not possible.
your father would never want to hurt you.
BEHROOZ: It's true.
tariq told me everything.
DINA: He was lying.
BEHROOZ: No, he wasn't.
mom, I don't know what to do.
you have to help me.
DINA: Where are you now?
BEHROOZ: I'm near the Metrolink station on Lassen in Chatsworth.
DINA: Are you using Tariq's car?
BEHROOZ: Yes.
DINA: Hide it.
I'll pick you up there in a half hour.
BEHROOZ: Hurry.
that's it.
let me know the minute you get something from her.
Yeah.
we got our leverage.
how long have you been planning this operation?
two years?
five years?
ten?
all this planning for one day.
you do realize if all the reactors melt down, hundreds of thousands of people will die.
every war has casualties.
these people don't know about your war.
these people are innocent.
no one is innocent.
you really believe that?
your time or mine, trying to explain something you can never understand.
maybe I understand more than you think.
I doubt it.
I know that something happened today to challenge your commitment to your war.
you weren't willing to let your son become a casualty.
that's why you were shot.
protecting him from his father.
I understand that.
I know what it's like to watch your child be threatened and feel helpless
right now Behrooz is out there alone...
and you and I know he's not gonna last very long.
his father will find him...
...and kill him.
there is another option.
if you were to help us find the override device...
we will protect your son.
so he can spend the rest of his life in prison?
no, so he can walk away from all of this, immune from prosecution.
how?
Mrs. Araz, your son is a minor.
he's 17 years old.
I can get him a legal and binding pardon signed by the president of the United States.
you don't have the authority to do this.
I can reach the president.
if you provide us with the information that allows us to find the override device-- in time
I am confident that the president will sign that pardon.
and this offer expires the second another reactor melts down.
do you understand me?
you don't have a lot of time.
I would think about this.
show me this document.
and I'll help you find what you want.
can we rule out this boy's involvement with the terrorist action?
no, sir. It's likely he knew of his parents' plans.
he probably helped them.
Jack, you're asking me to grant clemency to a terrorist.
Mr. President, I'm sorry, but I don't think we have a choice.
in all of my professional experience, I believe that we have to give in to this woman's demands.
have you tried negotiating with her?
we don't have time.
in approximately two hours, five nuclear reactors are gonna go critical unless we find the override device.
she is our only link.
well, I'm uncomfortable with this, but I trust your judgment.
I'll release the letter.
thank you, Mr. President.
make sure that document is non-binding.
Yes, I understand.
miss Raines?
did you talk to them?
Yes.
Edgar, I'm sorry. They can't get your mother.
why not? They're five miles off the highway.
it wouldn't take that much time.
they know where she is.
then what's the problem? Thousands of people are stuck on the Interstate in traffic.
it's taking the combined efforts of the police and the National Guard to get them moving.
so who cares about one old woman.
they've got to throw their resources into saving the maximum number of lives.
if my mother were rich or a politician, they'd find a way to save her.
this is Edgar Stiles.
I need another switching station for that number.
do you need it again?
no, I've got it logged. Hold the line.
thank you.
go ahead, please.
mom.
Hello, honey.
mom, I've been trying everything.
I can't get anyone out there to help you.
I've done everything I could. I did.
I'm sure you did, honey.
it's okay.
it's not okay.
the fallout's coming toward you.
it's 15 miles away.
I know.
I'm watching it on the news and...
I know what to do.
ma, there's nothing you can do.
you can't stuff towels under the door.
that's not what I'm talking
what do you mean?
they've been talking about radiation poisoning on the news.
that's not something I want to go through, especially since there's only one way it can end.
honey, I want to end things on my terms as opposed to all that pain and suffering.
mom.
it's the right thing to do.
it's the only thing-- you know that.
no, I don't.
you have been a wonderful son, Edgar.
you've been a gift to me and your father.
it's okay. I'm going to a better place, and...
I'll see you there, but not for a long time.
you've got a lot ahead of you. Great things.
maybe I can get someone to you. I'll keep trying.
you've got a very important job to do there.
a lot of people are counting on you.
so...
I'm going to hang up now, and I want you to know how very, very much I love you.
mom.
ma?
Edgar, where are you going?
I have to get out of here.
what are you talking about?
my mother. She lives next to the San Gabriel Island nuclear plant.
she wasn't able to evacuate in time.
we still have five other nuclear reactors that are on the verge of melting down.
I need you at your station.
I don't care what you need.
you better start caring.
you have a choice right now.
obey orders or end up in a jail cell.
you're going to arrest me for trying to save my mother's life?
Edgar, if what you're saying is true, there's nothing you can do for your mother, but there are thousands of other people whose lives you can save.
suppose your mother were here right now.
what would make her proud?
what do you think she'd want you to do?
she'd want me to help.
then don't you think you should?
man: We're ready to go.
we're just setting up the comm line.
this is a pardon for your son signed by the president.
this is acceptable.
where is he?
he's at Lindower Memorial Hospital.
it's not far.
set up a perimeter around Lindower Memorial.
I want you to call him and tell him we're coming to pick him up.
give her the phone.
we have to record the call.
Hello?
it's me. Where are you?
waiting for Nasim.
I don't know why he's taking so long.
don't worry about that now.
things have changed.
what do you mean?
listen carefully, Behrooz.
government agents found me.
I'm with them now.
Behrooz, they know everything.
Behrooz, just a few more minutes, okay?
but it's all right.
everything is going to be all right.
I made a deal.
what are you talking about?
you're going to be okay.
you won't be arrested or even named-- in any of this.
I don't understand.
I'm going to help them stop your father.
you are?
Yes.
you said that I would be okay.
but what about you?
we'll talk about that later.
right now, these men are coming to pick you up.
I want you to go with them.
are they making you say this?
no.
I don't know who these people are.
I want to be sure that they're not forcing you to say this.
I'll come with them.
you'll know when you see me.
okay?
I'll meet you outside.
no. Tell him to go to the emergency room.
I want him to stay where it's crowded.
did you hear that?
Yes.
I'll see you in a few minutes, Behrooz.
okay.
we're transferring the suspect.
I want to set up a protective cordon right away.
copy that.
let's go.
uncle Nasim.
I have to go.
what about the pain medication?
my mom's getting it from somewhere else, but thanks for trying.
what are you doing?
I can't let you go. Why not?
I spoke to your father.
what?
he told me you need help.
you don't know what you're talking about. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
I gave your father my word.
my father is a terrorist.
he's involved in what's happened today.
stop talking, Behrooz. I swear, it's true.
you're talking nonsense. No, I'm not!
he's behind the kidnapping this morning, and the reactors melting down.
we're all involved-- my mother and me.
we've killed people.
your father will be furious when he hears this.
my father is coming here?
No!
I tried to stop him.
you broke my heart,
you broke my heart.
if you kill me, mother will tell them everything.
tell who?
the police. She's with them.
I don't believe you. It's the truth.
she wants me to be safe and, if you kill me, she will ruin everything you're doing.
liar! If you don't believe me, look outside.
they're coming to pick me up.
help!
shut up!
Tony, did you notify Security?
no.
something is wrong.
set up a Level Three cordon around the hospital.
I'm going with you.
no, you're not!
what's going on here?
there's been a shooting.
who? One of the pharmacists.
who are you? My name is Jack Bauer.
I work with the Counterterrorist Unit.
we've been tracking the man who did the shooting.
where is he? Someone just radioed in from C wing.
saw a Middle Eastern man running. He has a hostage.
a 17-year-old boy? I think so.
what are the possible exits from that wing?
>From where he was spotted, he's pretty much got to end up in the east parking garage. We've got men
you tell your supervisor to tell his men to back off.
no one makes contact with him.
do you understand me? All right.
hang on a sec.
yeah?
Tony, it's Jack.
navi Araz is here.
he's already killed his wife's brother.
what about the boy?
I don't know. We're going to have to lock down all the exits.
I think he's headed for the parking garage.
I need you to meet me on the east side of the building with backup.
copy that. We're going to the east side of the building.
we need backup teams there right away.
what happened?
we're still looking for your son.
there is more. Tell me.
Mrs. Araz, we're going to find your son, all right?
I hate you.
I've always hated you.
the only reason I never said so was because I was afraid of you.
but I'm not afraid of you anymore.
get in. Go to hell.
get in!
Jack, we're in the garage now.
we've secured the exit.
I'm almost there. Can you get an ID?
no. Nothing yet.
let me see your hands!
put your hands where I can see them! Now!
careful!
drop the gun!
you'll hit the boy!
let the boy go!
we can work this out.
I will put my gun down if you give me the boy.
all I want is the boy.
stay back!
put the g-- Tony, stop the car!
mom!
keep her in the car!
that stairwell leads to the basement.
he's got nowhere to go but down. Set up a link with CTU now!
copy that. Call CTU. We need backup here.
Mrs. Araz, calm down, we'll get your son, all right? Calm down.
DRISCOLL: We've uploaded the plans to you from the building department.
there are only three exits from the hospital's basement.
we've got all entrances and exits covered.
he's trapped down there.
let's try to open up a negotiation.
my husband won't negotiate.
why is that?
he doesn't need to.
he has to assume I have agreed to help you in return for my son's safety.
well, he can't stay down there with him forever.
he won't. In two hours, all the reactors will have gone critical. After that, it won't matter what I tell you, and he can kill my son.
I am only helping you to save his life.
I believe in our cause, and if you can't save my son, I am happy to see the reactors melt down.
did you get that?
any problems getting the canisters out?
no. They were hidden exactly where you said they'd be.
Russians will finally understand the consequences of occupying our homeland when we turn Moscow into a graveyard.
Erwich has just cleared airport security.
then the authorities don't know anything's been stolen.
not yet. Then the only thing we have left to take care of is Bauer.
you paged me?
I need you to do something.
we have our hands full searching for the nerve gas.
Bauer is a priority.
I just signed a treaty.
now all of a sudden
I find out that the terrorists are still out there... with nerve gas.
MARTHA: You people have to listen to me.
I had a document.
it was hidden in my blouse.
it's gone. Someone stole it from me.
this is what she was like before you sent her to Vermont.
are you suggesting that I readmit her?
for her sake, if nothing else.
aaron, my wife is gone.
we have a priority alert.
you've been burrowing into classified
CTU protocols without authorization.
SPENSER: I don't know what you're talking about.
stop. I know you logged on to the security subsystem where you had no right to be.
AUDREY: Someone knew that Jack was alive.
it's critical to our investigation that we find out who that was.
did you let that man into CTU?
this man is a professional assassin.
he just killed Dr. Paulson, he tried to kill me.
who told you to let that man into CTU?
the White House.
Mr. Cummings.
Jack: I don't understand the problem.
david Palmer was murdered because he was about to expose Walt Cummings' connection to the terrorists.
when Cummings failed to frame me for Palmer's murder, he tried to kill me.
all that may be true, Jack, but we don't have proof.
we can prove that Cummings used Spenser to get Jack's assassin into CTU.
all we have is Spenser's word.
that's not enough to build a case.
you don't have time to build a case.
you want the nerve gas,
cummings is your connection.
cummings is the President's Chief Advisor.
how exactly do you suggest we get to him?
I can secretly meet with Mike Novick, enlist his help. How do we know
Novick's not in this with Cummings?
because I know him. He'll listen to me.
and the President will listen to him.
with Novick's help, we can isolate Cummings.
Jack, as much as I appreciate you wanting to be involved, you don't work here anymore.
that's exactly the reason why I should do this.
if it backfires, there'll be no fallout on you.
I think it's worth a try.
I agree.
it's your call.
all right, Jack.
but just so we're clear, this is about finding the nerve gas, not getting revenge for David Palmer.
understood.
work out your protocols with Ms. Raines.
we'll keep looking through
Cummings' background for anything that supports our case.
we're gonna need to set up a secure channel for you
can you bring up the satellite photo of the compound?
Jack, I'm sorry if I'm being a little distant.
I just...
it's taking me a little while to get used to you being alive.
I understand.
I'll call Novick.
when Cummings finds out that you're still alive, he's gonna come after you again.
Yeah.
yes?
NATHANSON: Is Bauer dead?
I haven't received confirmation yet.
your man should have taken care of this by now.
perhaps he had to alter his strike window.
has the nerve gas reached the port?
not yet.
but they should be arriving any minute.
good. I have to go.
I'm late for a briefing.
you have all the shipping documents in order?
the canisters will arrive at port in your country in eight days.
ground transportation to your base camp will take another day.
will you need my help getting them to your target?
no. I've arranged transport to Moscow.
have they found my wife yet?
no, sir, but Secret Service is confident she's still on the grounds.
if they're so damn confident, why can't anyone find her?
what the hell are they doing?
I'm sure it's just a matter of time, Mr. President.
sorry I'm late.
I was just setting up the video.
this was made by terrorists, to document the effects of exposure to nerve gas.
it was recovered from a training camp two years ago.
disorientation occurs moments after exposure.
now the video jumps forward, no more than a couple of minutes, we estimate.
within that time, there's permanent damage to the central nervous system.
violent seizures take over.
bronchial membranes blister and peel away.
death occurs within...
stop.
now, according to DOD, the Sentox-Six nerve gas stolen from the airport is far more lethal than the gas we just saw used.
if released in a town or city, for example, the cloud will remain lethal for much longer.
are we any closer to finding the canisters?
there haven't been any reports of progress, sir.
excuse me, Mr. President.
I need to return a call to the State Department.
do you have those updates, Walt?
Yes, here's one from CTU.
also one from Homeland Security.
this is Bauer.
Jack. Mike Novick.
it's good to hear your voice.
yours, too, Mike.
I'm so sorry about David Palmer.
I know how much he meant to you.
yeah... What's going on?
I have a lead on the stolen nerve gas.
isn't CTU coordinating the search?
this is something I need to bring directly to you.
I don't understand.
I can't talk about it on the phone, Mike.
we need to meet.
no one can know about this, not even the President.
I'm not comfortable with all this secrecy, Jack.
you need to give me some idea what this is about.
it concerns Walt Cummings.
there's an area a few hundred yards outside the southwest gate.
it's at the far side of the property from the main house.
Thanks, Mike. I'll see you in 15 minutes.
Hey.
they said we can leave soon.
I know, I heard.
what about you?
are you coming home with us?
no, I need to stay here.
CTU still needs my help.
Derek, I'd like to speak with your mom for a moment, is that all right?
Yeah, of course.
take him downstairs.
she'll be there soon.
you're not coming back to us at all, are you?
no.
I never thought I was going to be back here at CTU.
I would never have gotten you involved in all of this, I promise you.
it's the woman who interviewed me, isn't it? Audrey Raines.
you were involved with her.
I could tell by the way you looked at each other.
I was with her before I had to disappear.
are you still in love with her?
Yes.
does she still love you?
I don't know.
Mr. Bauer.
your transportation's standing by.
I'll be right there.
I'm sorry, I have to go.
thank you.
thank you.
Novick's VOICE: I'm not comfortable with all this secrecy, Jack.
you need to give me some idea what this is about.
Jack's VOICE: It concerns Walt Cummings.
Novick's VOICE: There's an area, a few hundred yards outside the southwest gate.
it's at the far side of the property from the main house.
your man didn't do his job. Don't put that on me, Nathanson.
you were supposed to have Bauer killed hours ago.
I'm not going to warn you again.
pull yourself together.
you heard the call, didn't you?
Bauer's coming here to expose my role in all this.
you're assuming he knows the extent of it.
well, it's obvious he knows enough.
now, what the hell am I supposed to do?
at this point, there's only one thing you can do.
Mrs. Logan, please come out of there.
Mrs. Logan...
don't let them take me.
you've got to listen to me.
they're just trying to help you.
no. No.
they're trying to set me up.
they're trying to make it look like
I had a breakdown, so they can cart me off to some psychiatric hospital.
ma'am... Aaron...
it's someone in my husband's administration.
they're trying to shut me up because I know the truth.
what truth?
I know...
don't let him take me, Aaron. Please?
we have our orders, Mrs. Logan.
I'm sorry.
Aaron... please...
Audrey, did you check with the airports?
Yes. They've all been alerted on the missing canisters.
and CHP? Same thing.
trucks are being checked at all major interstates.
make sure there's no mention of the Sentox nerve gas.
the White House is clear about that.
Yes, I know. The bulletin only describes the missing canisters.
there's no mention of chemical weapons.
good. The last thing we need is for the public to find out that nerve gas is out there.
...what were you doing in there?
making sure the canisters were secured properly.
don't want them knocking around when this gets loaded onto a ship.
my men secured the canisters according to my instructions.
you don't need to be concerned. All right.
here are the customs documents you need when the shipment arrives, along with the remote trigger and the arming codes.
I'll take the rest of my payment now.
our arrangement was you'll get your final installment when the ship left port.
there's not gonna be a problem. They're loading out in less than an hour.
then you won't have long to wait.
fine.
ms. Raines?
Yes.
we've been released.
Oh, good.
can I ask you something?
of course.
do you still have feelings for Jack?
I'm sorry, but that's personal.
I know, but he's been living with my son and me for the last six months.
we started to become a family...
...and I care about him.
do you know he still loves you?
if you don't love him, let him go.
Jack, it's Audrey.
what's going on?
what?
Audrey, what?
when this is over, are you coming back?
I don't know.
are you going back to Diane?
no...
I don't know what I'm doing yet.
I haven't had any time to think about it.
is it true what she said?
What'd she say?
that you still love me.
I never stopped loving you...
not for one second.
then don't go away again, Jack, please.
it's more complicated than that.
I know.
it's time.
I gotta go.
I have to go.
Yeah, I know, I know. Okay. Bye.
no, no! Keep me out of this!
the last thing I want to do is comment to the press about the roadblocks going up.
and we can't have any leaks about the nerve gas.
it would just cause a panic.
come in.
pardon me, sir. We found Mrs. Logan.
is she all right?
she's fine, sir.
she was hiding in the stables.
stables? What the hell did she think she was doing?
Mr. President...
I feel awkward mentioning this, but...
Mrs. Logan said some things...
about David Palmer.
Yes, sir.
I've heard her conspiracy theories, Aaron.
I've heard them all.
but thank you for your concern, Aaron.
they found my wife.
good.
Mr. President... we need to talk.
what is it, Walt?
I was hoping to spare you from this, but I'm afraid Jack Bauer is forcing my hand.
he's on his way here to meet with Mike Novick.
Bauer? Why?
he's going to accuse me of helping the terrorists acquire the nerve gas.
that's ridiculous.
no, sir.
it's the truth.
what did you say?
through a proxy, I leaked information to the terrorists about where the nerve gas was hidden.
you have to understand, sir, this gas was never going to pose a threat to American lives.
never pose a threat?!
people died in the airport!
hostages were killed!
we had hoped to limit the collateral damage.
collateral damage"?! What are you thinking?
this is an unspeakable crime.
Walt... you have to answer for this.
Mr. President... it's in your best interest to hear me out before you make that phone call.
what do you mean "my best interest"?
Sentox gas is being smuggled out of the country by separatists who think they are going to use it against the Russians.
however, that nerve gas will never reach Russian soil.
and you know this how?
we control the remote detonators on those gas canisters.
as soon as they reach the terrorists' base, we'll trigger the canisters by satellite and release the gas.
so everything that happened today was just to kill a some terrorists?
no, the goal is to produce a smoking gun, proof of the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Central Asia.
this is unbelievable.
it's necessary.
it will finally give us a pretext to increase our military presence in the region, guaranteeing the flow of oil for the next generation.
how dare you.
how dare you act without my consent.
how dare you put this administration
this entire country in jeopardy.
you're a traitor.
no, no, Mr. President, I am a patriot!
doing what needs to be done for the continued safety and well-being of this nation!
my God...
you gave the order to have David Palmer killed.
that was an unfortunate but necessary intervention.
he found out too much and we had... Walt!
you're rationalizing murder, the murder of a president.
you're going to contact these people and recover the nerve gas before it leaves the country.
I'm afraid I can't do that. Why not?
I don't know where the nerve gas is.
and the man I have working inside has gone dark-- he's unreachable.
now, you'll let things play out as they are.
otherwise, your administration will be implicated and your presidency will be destroyed.
????
thanks for seeing me like this, Mike.
what is it?
did you tell anyone we were meeting?
of course not.
son of a bitch! Who did you tell?
who did you tell?! I didn't tell anybody, Jack!
man: Jack Bauer, stay right where you are.
put down your weapons and put your hands up.
what's the meaning of this?!
tell your men to stand down!
I'm sorry, sir, we can't do that.
he's here at my request! We have orders to use force if necessary.
orders? From who?
the President of the United States.
get on your knees.
Thanks.
novick and Bauer have been taken into custody.
so we're just gonna lock Mike Novick up? For the time being.
well, what good will it do? Eventually, he's gonna get out, and he's gonna talk to the press.
what can he say? He doesn't know anything.
I thought you told me he talked to Jack Bauer.
we stopped Bauer before he could give Mike any details.
what's he gonna think?
we're detaining him.
Bauer was about to divulge national security secrets that Mike's not authorized to hear.
that's why Mike's being detained.
and what about Bauer?
he must have talked to other people at CTU and told them what he knows.
as soon as this nerve gas leaves U. S. soil, it's gonna be very difficult to prove that either of us is connected to this in any way.
and you're sure that these-these-these detonators will work, that the Sentox gas will be released before it can be used against the Russians? Yes.
right now all you need to do is authorize me to terminate CTU's involvement
we'll tell them we've got the situation under control, and that we'll deal with Bauer.
who, after all, is not officially affiliated with them any longer.
all right.
good.
yes?
Mr. President, I have
Mrs. Logan for you.
not now.
Yes, sir.
what is Jack Bauer doing here, why is he under arrest, and why wasn't I told?
orders of the president. Directly?
no. It came through Walt Cummings' office.
okay. Thank you.
we're no longer running point on the search for the canisters.
we've been ordered off by Division.
Why?
Yeah, I know. I tried calling the president.
he's not taking my calls. What about Mike Novick?
Jack should be with him by now.
Novick's people say he's unreachable, and Jack's cell goes right to voice-mail.
something's wrong.
Yeah, I know, but I don't know what we can do about it.
I do. What?
we can disregard the order.
we're not disregarding a presidential order.
if we don't, we will not find this nerve gas.
Mr. Buchanan, will you step outside for a moment?
I can't have you talking to me like that in front of these people.
you're right. I'm sorry. Are we clear about who's in charge here?
Yeah, but my advice stands.
one more thing that comes with experience.
okay, disregard the order.
thank you.
EVELYN: Is there anything else you'd like me to pack for you?
maybe a few of your... nicer dresses?
I'm being confined to a psychiatric ward, Evelyn.
I don't think there are gonna be any black-tie events.
sorry.
how'd this happen?
what's that, Mrs. Logan?
Charles and me.
I was his confidante.
and now I'm...
...less than an afterthought.
I'm sure the president would be here if he could.
he's the President of the United States, Evelyn.
he can do whatever he wants.
if he wanted to be here, he would be.
to a class three detention facility.
those are my orders, sir.
you're Pierce, right?
aaron Pierce. You served under David Palmer. Yes, I did.
I need to speak with you just for a moment, please. That's not possible.
it concerns David Palmer's killer.
all right.
Walt Cummings ordered the assassination of David Palmer.
I know that's hard to believe, but I can prove it, it's true.
actually, it's not that hard to believe.
someone in his administration is undermining his authority.
that is equivalent to a coup d'\tat.
agent Pierce, please...
please, I need your help.
Bauer's escaped.
when? I didn't get a code alert.
my comm's down.
call it in, have agents cover the west gate
that's where he was headed. What about you?
I'll take your post.
go.
Yes, sir.
what's the problem? I don't know.
but you need to call Lynn McGill, make sure we're in charge of this.
and I don't know what to tell him!
you don't have to tell him anything.
you're the president.
agent Pierce, we're in the middle of a meeting, if you don't mind.
Mr. President, Stop this!
I'm the President of the United States
get your hands off this man!
agent Pierce, do something!
I am, Mr. President.
I'm upholding my oath to protect you.
that won't have any effect, sir.
I've overridden the distress line.
Mr. Cummings is guilty of conspiring with terrorists.
he facilitated the theft of a military-grade nerve gas, and today is responsible for the death of at least three people, including David Palmer.
I know about that, but there's an explanation.
what do you mean, you know about that?
Mr. Bauer, please, I just found out a couple minutes ago.
it's very complicated.
I don't know what this man has told you, but we need to find that nerve gas now, and I mean immediately, before it is too late.
it's already too late.
what do you mean?
apparently, it's on its way out of the country.
where is it?!
he told me he doesn't know!
he's lying to you, sir!
the man I have inside has gone dark,
I don't know.
I'm done talking with you, you understand me?
now you read my file.
and I'm going to take our your left.
and then I'm going to cut you.
so for the last time, where is the nerve gas?
stop.
stop! Stop! I'll tell you! I'll tell you!
: I'll tell you.
it's-it's on a freighter leaving the port of Long Beach at 2: 30.
Jack: How is it concealed?!
in a container carrying medical supplies.
what's the container number? I don't know.
what's the number?!
I don't know!
I-I'd tell you, I swear.
logan: Mr. Bauer!
I don't know.
man: Mr. Buchanan, I've got Jack Bauer on line three.
Jack, what's going on? We've been trying to reach you.
bill, hold on. I'm going to put you on speakerphone.
bill, I'm standing here with the president.
the nerve gas is at Long Beach Harbor in a container full of medical supplies on a freighter bound for Central Asia.
it's set to depart at 2: 30 p. m.
how solid is the intel, Jack?
it came directly from Cummings.
disregard the order.
Yes. Absolutely.
I'm alerting CBP.
get hazmat teams in there and set up a perimeter.
have medical teams standing by in case the gas is released.
got it.
good work, Jack.
are you heading back to CTU?
I don't know yet.
copy that.
Yes, Mr. President?
take back your shield and get Walt Cummings out of my sight.
Yes, sir.
he told me it was too late, and I believed him.
you need to understand, I trusted Walt Cummings...
but he lied to me.
I was coerced.
there is, uh, one more thing that we need to discuss.
what is that, sir?
you.
I accomplished what I set out to do, which was to identify and locate David Palmer's killer.
I would like to stay on until the nerve gas is retrieved.
after that, I give you my word I will simply disappear again.
all right.
I think that would be best for the good of the country.
Yes, sir.
thank you, Mr. Bauer.
thank you, Mr. President.
I'll see you soon.
wait. Hold up, Kevin.
what's happening?
come on. Get out of the car.
be careful.
what?
you were right.
there was a conspiracy.
david was trying to warn you and warn me.
I should have listened to you.
: I-I...
Y-you... you believe me now?
it was Walt Cummings.
he lied to me.
and you went along with it.
I'm sorry, Martha.
sending me away without a word...
like I was... some nuisance to be gotten rid of.
excuse me, Mr. President,
Yes, um... thank you, Wendy.
see that the First Lady's bags get back to her room.
of course.
I've got to go.
Chloe, do we have confirmation on the intel Jack gave us?
we don't have CTU teams in the vicinity,
they're going out in a shipment of medical supplies.
Yeah, yeah, they know all that already.
and we don't know which one the nerve gas is in.
it's container 539146, box seven.
I was able to hack into the ship's manifest.
it's the only container stocking medical supplies.
that's great.
make sure all the strike force units have that.
all right, got it. Yeah.
that's him.
Buchanan: His name is Ivan Erwich.
he's a chemical engineer trained at the University of St. Petersburg.
joined his country's separatist movement six years ago.
do we have any clearer images, any file photos?
they know. Stand by.
what's the situation?
the strike team is in place, Mr. President.
we're just waiting for the video feed to come up.
feed's up.
FINN: CTU, we've located the target container.
no hostiles present.
you have the green light, Agent Finn.
if a bullet breaches one of those canisters, we'll have a massive casualty situation.
FINN: Copy that.
masks on.
go!
don't move!
put your hands in the air now!
he's dead.
open 'em up.
open 'em up. Let's go! Open 'em all up.
this one.
empty. Next. Moving on, moving on. No.
FINN: Come on, get it open.
empty. Next. Come on, move it.
open it, open it.
next.
open it, come on, come on.
what do we got? What do we got?!
nothing?!
there are
repeat, the nerve gas is not here.
get Walt Cummings in here now!
Yes, sir.
damn it!
the nerve gas isn't there.
it has to be.
where are the canisters?!
I don't know.
I-I've told you everything.
they have to be there.
Oh, God...
what is it?
that's Schaeffer, the man we had inside.
they must've found out we reprogrammed the detonators.
it's his cell phone, sir.
who's calling you?
that's Schaeffer's number.
we're on it.
answer it now.
yes?
ERWICH: We know you've altered
cummings: Who is this?
I think you know my name... as I now know yours.
is President Logan with you?
nor did anyone else in the government.
I was acting alone.
do you really expect me to believe that?
it's the truth.
Erwich, listen.
we can negotiate something.
I don't negotiate with my enemies.
I eliminate them.
I'm on the phone with a man who claims to James Nathanson.
he was Walt Cummings' contact.
he says he has information about the terrorists, but he will only talk to you.
what do you want with me?
protection.
the terrorists you're after are trying to kill me.
what makes you think I'm not gonna kill you myself?
because you want to stop the Sentox gas from being released on American soil.
so do I.
nathanson, stay down!
stay down!
what's on the chip? Please, what's on the chip!
I have a thumb drive that's gonna help us find the Sentox.
the decryption element kicked out a company called Omicron International.
pull up their senior executive roster,
see if a man named Christopher Henderson's on the list.
okay, here it is.
senior Vice President of Research and Development.
send me the decrypted files over to my PDA.
that's gonna be a little bit hard to do right now, Jack.
the two of you are up to something, and I'm not gonna stand for it.
this is a deliberate attempt to circumvent my authority.
Lynn, we're all on the same side.
if you're father wasn't the Secretary of Defense, I'd have you thrown out of here.
I don't have that problem with you.
I spent a year securing a weapon that would bring Moscow to its knees.
and you waste it.
we were betrayed, Bierko.
someone must pay. I agree.
this is President Logan. What is it you want?
I want the route of Suvarov's motorcade.
if you refuse to cooperate,
I will have no choice but to release all the Sentox nerve gas.
he wants to assassinate Suvarov.
don't negotiate with them!
isn't that the point of the treaty you just signed?
Mr. President, I'm glad that we have this opportunity to thank you and Mrs. Logan for your hospitality.
the motorcade will take service roads to the 118...
Mrs. Logan... Aaron,
I've decided to drive to the airport with the Suvarovs.
I'll ride up front.
no, that's not necessary.
Yes, it is.
the following takes places between 4pm and 5pm
yes?
where is the motorcade now? Just getting on the 118.
how long before they reach the ambush point?
about 40 minutes.
good. We'll be waiting.
get everything ready.
Mr. President, I asked Secret Service to sent a threat assessment for President Suvarov's route.
the most vulnerable point is here, the downtown corridor.
this is the most likely point of attack.
if an ambush were to occur.
it's going to happen, Mike.
we gave the terrorists Suvarov's route.
I need to come up with a public response.
I need to convince the world that
Suvarov's death only underscores the importance of this antiterrorism treaty that we just signed.
I'll, uh, begin working on a statement, sir.
yes?
thank you. I'll... let the president know.
what? What is it, Mike?
what's going on?
who was that?
agent Pierce. Um,
I don't know how to tell you this. Just tell me.
Mrs. Logan is riding with the Suvarovs.
what are you talking about? Sir, she got into that limousine.
Oh, my God.
Didn't-Didn't the Secret Service try to stop her?!
there was no reason to stop her.
the motorcade is under Secret Service escort.
as far as they're concerned, she's not in any danger.
she wants me to call back the motorcade
she's trying to save the Suvarovs.
should I alert them?
Yes!
no, stop, wait.
if we warn them, the terrorists are going to set off the gas.
where are they now?
they're still on the 118.
get my wife on the phone.
my aunt visited Los Angeles in the 1950s.
she told me this area was filled with orange groves, but I haven't seen any.
I suppose it's all been built over, no?
Yes. I-I... I was just trying to remember.
um, I think your aunt's memory is better than mine.
I visited here when I was a child, but I don't recall the orange groves.
Yeah, this is Pierce.
Mrs. Logan, it's the president for you on line one. Thank you, Aaron.
listen to me carefully.
I want you...
Yes, I think they had a wonderful visit.
and they would very much like for us to come to Moscow.
wouldn't that be lovely?
I want you to tell the Suvarovs that I need you back here.
I'm gonna have one of the follow cars bring you back.
I don't think so, Charles. Tell them now, while I'm on the phone.
I know that you want me to call the motorcade back, but...
the terrorists were very specific:
if-if I don't allow them to attack the motorcade, they're gonna release canisters of nerve gas in multiple locations.
well, I... guess we'll just have to figure something out before that happens.
we're trying! We're trying, but we haven't found them yet.
you need to get out of the car.
okay, I should go now, but you'll call me Martha...
if there's any change of plans? Damn it, Martha!
okay, bye-bye. I'll-I'll talk to you soon.
she won't get out of the limousine.
my God.
we got to do something, Mike; we got to get her out of the car.
I could have, uh, one of the trail cars stop them and force her out, say that I need her back here.
you could, but... if Martha is desperate to save the Suvarovs, she might feel that the only remaining option is to tell them the truth.
and Suvarov will know that I gave him up for assassination.
sir, do you want me to recall the motorcade or not?
Edgar, meet me in the server room in a few minutes.
am I in trouble?
no, but there's something very important that we need to discuss.
okay. And, Edgar, don't tell anyone where you're going.
this needs to stay between us. Sure.
what did Audrey Raines want?
she was just going over some DOD protocols.
I thought you were supposed to be monitoring chatter.
we are. Why isn't it on my screen, Carrie?
I didn't think you wanted us to mirror erything to your system.
I thought you wanted to save time. I do want to save time.
it saves me time by not having to clean up more mistakes.
mirror everything until we've secured this nerve gas.
is that clear?
Yes, sir.
the thumb drive data Jack sent us checks out as authentic.
it's time-stamped by DOD and CIA.
so Omicron International did make Sentox gas for the military.
Yeah, and some terrorists found out about it.
or worse- they were in contact with Omicron.
who is this Henderson?
christopher Henderson, Senior Vice President, R&D.
Jack said he knew him, but he wouldn't talk about it.
is he connected with the Sentox?
doesn't say; it just said he was a senior VP. All right.
yeah?
Jack, we've authenticated the thumb drive data.
Omicron definitely made the Sentox for the military.
okay, I'm almost there- look, I need you to work something up that gets me through the front door without them knowing I'm CTU.
do you think it's necessary to go in covertly?
Yeah. There's someone I need to talk to.
I don't want him to see me coming.
Yeah. Who is he?
someone I used to work for.
where?
CTU. He was the man who recruited me.
you've never mentioned him.
I know.
things ended badly between us.
what happened?
I was part of an investigation that uncovered evidence that implicated him in the sale of classified intelligence to defense contractors.
we never had enough evidence to indict him, but he lost his job, his command.
even as he was walking out the door, he maintained his innocence.
he never forgave me for being part of the investigation.
are you convinced he did it?
I was at the time.
Jack, Chloe can't find a direct connection between the Sentox and Henderson.
trust me, if Omicron was making Sentox, legally or illegally,
Henderson knew about it.
get back to me as soon as you got my cover.
all right, I'm on it.
what are you doing here, Chloe?
same thing you're doing here.
Edgar, thank you for coming.
look, whatever this is about, I don't have a lot of time.
we don't have a single active lead on this nerve gas.
that's not exactly true.
Jack is following a lead out in the field.
how do you know? I just spoke with him.
everyone's looking for him. Lynn issued an arrest warrant.
that's why we wanted to talk to you, Edgar.
Lynn is losing it- first he went after Jack, and then he took Bill Buchanan out of play.
Lynn is incapable of leading us through this crisis.
so you're both working behind his back?
we're afraid that if we bring him into this, he might derail the only good lead that we have.
we have to help Jack locate the nerve gas before it's too late.
what do you want from me?
cover for Chloe until Jack reports back.
please.
okay. Thank you.
okay, fine. Yeah.
that was Secret Service.
as you can see, the motorcade continues to make its way to the airport without incident.
there won't be any warning, Mike.
when these people attack, they will be fast and they will be merciless.
you can count on that.
I have to talk to this man.
m- Maybe I can convince him to hold off.
hold off?
just until Martha gets out of the car.
she wasn't supposed to be a part of this in the first place.
sir, I don't think that would change his plan.
he has to know that my wife's in the car!
I can't lose her, Mike.
the only way to keep Martha safe is for me to call Secret Service and tell them to turn the motorcade around.
what about... what about CTU?
do they have any active leads on the nerve gas?
as of five minutes ago, they don't...
nothing that would help our situation.
what am I missing, Mike?!
there's got to be some way out, something that I'm not seeing.
you're not missing anything.
any action we take to save Martha would also save the Suvarovs, and if that happens, the terrorists will release the gas.
unfortunately, it's that simple.
then there's nothing more we can do, Mike.
unless I warn them.
Martha's going to die with the Suvarovs.
Aaron... have there been any changes?
excuse me?
changes to what, Mrs. Logan?
I- I was just wondering if there had been any changes to our route.
we haven't gotten any revised instructions, ma'am.
thank you.
you sure you're all right, Martha?
Yes, yes. I just wanted to make sure we don't run into any heavy traffic.
understood.
those protocols should be coming over shortly.
who were you on the phone with?
homeland Security.
I gave you specific orders to have everyone's systems mirrored to mine.
I've been doing that.
but you're not finished, yet somehow you have time to chat with Homeland Security.
they needed us to give them updated code sets.
it'll just take another minute. No, it won't.
Stiles, finish her task.
Carrie, you're done.
what do you... mean, done?
fired. You don't work here anymore.
Mr. McGill, it's not her fault. She just...
Edgar, one more word out of you, you walk out with her.
what's it gonna be?
Where's Agent O'Brian?
she had to step away for a minute. Where?
I don't know.
OK, i through the gate how is my cover?
Jack, I'm still trying to get your credentials into Omicron's system.
you can't get into the building without them.
what's the problem?
Omicron's systems don't refresh often enough.
we need to push this page in manually.
okay, I'm in.
you're going in under the name of John Barrie.
you're with a company called Eclipse LLC.
John Barrie, Eclipse LLC.
I got it.
hold on a second; she hasn't planted it yet.
Chloe. What are you doing in here?
I asked her to help me.
she doesn't work for you, Ms. Raines; she works for me.
but I don't, and DOD has assignment priority over CTU.
we're in the middle of a real-time investigation, and we're understaffed.
Chloe's a department head- you can't just take her away from me.
I'm not taking her from you.
we needed a system patch on a server, and Chloe's the only one who could fix it.
well, then you come to me and you ask me.
everything in this office runs through me!
Lynn, we are all trying to do the same thing.
can we please just get past this?
Yeah, I'm past it. I want Chloe back.
okay, I'm finished here.
sorry, Mr. McGill, it won't happen again.
good afternoon.
John Barrie with Eclipse. I've got a 4: 30 with R&D.
thumb print, please.
go on in.
thank you.
well, I'll tell you what you do.
you kick the McAvoy meeting to next week on Thursday, but you keep everything else.
what about your trip to Washington?
that's right. Okay.
well, I got to talk to Kagan tomorrow morning.
I'll get back to you then.
can I help you, sir? Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm a little lost. I was looking for the men's room.
over there, second door.
thank you.
it's Jack. I need you to lose the secretary.
her name is Joanna Tandy.
all right, I'll take care of it.
christopher Henderson's office.
ms. Tandy? Yes?
Jane Espenson from accounting.
we need you to come down now and double-check some of these invoices.
what invoices?
it's a little difficult to explain over the phone.
would you mind popping down just for a minute?
fine.
thank you.
just for the record, I never believed you were dead.
what are you doing here?
earlier this morning, terrorists gained control of a large quantity of Sentox VX nerve gas.
Omicron manufactured it.
when I pulled up the executive list, your name was on it.
sure my name's on it- I work here.
Omicron had the contract.
we manufacture this stuff.
but every single gram of it went to the Department of Defense.
it's all been accounted for.
well, that can't be true, now, can it?
we have confirmation that terrorists are in control of 19 canisters of Sentox!
what are you accusing me now of, Jack?
being in bed with terrorists?
I'm following the leads!
well, the leads are wrong.
DOD destroyed the entire stockpile.
Sentox was responsible for the death of the people in the Sunrise Hills Mall less than two hours ago.
the news said it was chlorine gas.
that was a cover story to stop a widespread panic!
come on, Christopher, you know how this works!
the terrorists have threatened to release the rest of the gas.
good God.
well, whoever's implicating me in this knows my history with CTU.
I mean, I'm an easy target.
this is not a coincidence.
look, Jack, I know there's dirt between us, but I swear to you, I got nothing to do with this.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. I can't afford to take your word on this.
well, you're gonna have to take my word.
11 people died in that mall!
hundreds of thousands of others will if they release the rest of the Sentox.
you're not hearing me, Jack!
I had nothing to do with this!
then prove it to me.
I need complete access to Omicron's Sentox program.
I'm doing it now.
the entire operation was run from a bunker across the campus.
let me see the bunker.
let's go.
NSA chatter analysis just came in.
I decoded some words and phrases.
what were they saying?
it's too scrambled to make any complete sentences, but number strings keep coming up.
freeways?
those are the routes President Suvarov's taking to the airport.
the only other phrase I could decode refers to the downtown corridor.
how long ago did this chatter start?
about 30 minutes ago.
come on.
can we expand the search area?
I've got CTU air surveillance on everything east of Glendale.
what about the north?
edwards Air Force Base is giving us support there.
we're still at a dead end on finding new leads with the nerve gas.
excuse me, Mr. McGill, we think there might be an attack on President Suvarov's motorcade.
what?
Edgar just monitored some chatter from NSA and ran a threat assessment.
what are you doing analyzing chatter that isn't related to finding the nerve gas?
it came through on one of my filters.
the point is, sir, we found something.
don't you want to alert Secret Service considering that Suvarov is on his way to the airport?
based on an unsubstantiated theory from a couple of analysts?
I think I've been embarrassed enough for one day.
can we at least devote some limited resources to try to confirm this threat?
I'm sorry.
maybe I wasn't clear. No.
now go downstairs and focus on what you're supposed to be doing.
I don't think it would be a bad idea to pass along the intel.
well, I do.
I don't want to hear another word about it.
yes?
our men are in place.
how far out are they?
the motorcade will be there in less than 20 minutes.
are you sure no one is going to interfere with us?
I don't think so.
Logan knows the consequences if that happens.
but be alert.
make sure they haven't placed any of their people near you.
if police show up, we'll deal with them.
good.
I'll call you when it's over.
let's go, let's go.
keep them out.
if things don't go as planned, I'll use them here.
I'm busy, Ms. Raines.
Lynn, I just looked at this chatter report and I definitely think that we need to let Secret Service know of the threat.
I'm not going to repeat my orders to every person in this office individually.
my people are not going to chase that white elephant.
they're busy trying to locate 19 canisters of Sentox nerve gas.
has it occurred to you that if this threat is real, then it's likely that the terrorists who have the Sentox nerve gas are the same ones that are planning this attack?
this is an unverified threat!
if you want to hand it off to NSA, be my guest.
NSA can't recall the motorcade without going through a time-consuming approval process.
good.
that process helps eliminate false threats.
look, we don't have that time.
According... Ms. Raines, Ms. Raines, this office has made enough mistakes for one day, and I intend to stop the bleeding.
now let my people focus on their work or I will have you escorted out of here.
thank you.
I need to call this in to Secret Service, but they won't act on it unless Lynn verifies it.
he's never going to back you up on that. Yes, he is.
I need you to hack into Lynn's account for me.
I'll forge a message to Secret Service and make it look like it came from him.
that's illegal. Fine.
Edgar, I need you to put a blanket on my sub-net to make it look like I'm doing something else.
we could all end up in jail.
think about it for a second.
the Russian president, his wife, about 35 Secret Service, all dead in a few minutes.
all right, but for the record, this is not a good idea.
all right, I'll compose a message.
as soon as you have the forged verification file, call me.
excuse me. We need to talk.
what is it?
we've got a problem with Lynn.
Yeah, I know.
he's not listening to anybody.
well, it's going to start costing lives.
just give him some time. He'll come around.
Curtis, we don't have time.
we've got to get Bill back out here.
that's not going to happen, Audrey.
we need to make it happen.
what are you suggesting?
section 112.
on what grounds?
Lynn is mentally incapable of running CTU.
I may not agree with all his choices, but going from there to mentally unfit?
that's a stretch.
no, it's not and you know it.
you've seen him.
with Bill in custody, you are the ranking agent.
you are the only one that can invoke it.
I don't know, Audrey... Yes, you do.
Curtis, CTU is barely functional.
you are the one that can turn it around.
even if I agreed, Section 112 requires documentation, testimony, a lot of groundwork.
the record of what is going on right now is documentation enough.
please.
think about it.
I will.
good. Thank you.
Mr. President.
come in, Mike.
the motorcade is only 15 minutes away from the airport.
Yeah.
my father always told me that life was about problem solving.
that every problem had a solution.
you tell me where the solution is on this one.
I don't have an answer, Mr. President.
but if you want the Suvarov motorcade to turn back,
I need to do it now.
we know the terrorists are willing to kill civilians.
and the low... the low end of the casualty range on this one is...
100, 000 lives.
Yes, sir.
I decided before that I couldn't risk all those lives to save one man- the Russian president.
I can't risk those lives now...
even to save my own wife.
damn you, Martha, for putting me in this position.
you brought it on yourself.
pray with me, Mike.
uh, Mr. President, with all due respect, this is a personal matter.
I don't...
please, Mike.
how much longer until we can send this out?
a couple of minutes. I've almost hacked in.
we don't have a couple of minutes.
I'm almost there.
Oh, no.
Lynn cut us off.
what do I do?
I think it's too late to do anything.
Mr. Stiles, did you really think I wouldn't notice that you were trying to access my com?
Lynn, listen, we need to talk... Shut up!
these people are working against CTU protocols.
that means they're working against me.
Lynn, what is this?
we were trying to warn Secret Service on an attack on Suvarov's motorcade.
Curtis, take Mr. Stiles and Ms. O'Brian
put them in holding.
and then escort Audrey Raines out of CTU.
I can't do that.
Yes, you can, Curtis.
it's a direct order. Now do it.
you forced them to work covertly.
they had no choice.
you're not behaving rationally, Lynn.
you and you, take them all into custody including Mr. Manning.
if you try to carry out that command,
I will draw my weapon.
if he draws his weapon, shoot him.
this situation is already getting out of control.
don't make it worse.
why are you hesitating?!
I gave you an order. Now do it!
what would you like me to do, Mr. Manning?
What?!
Lynn McGill, I'm relieving you of your command under the incapacity clause of Section 112.
you'll do no such thing.
take him away.
you can't do that.
he can't do this. Don't touch me.
this is an unjustified usurpation of my authority.
do you hear me?
we're in the middle of a crisis.
there are going to be repercussions.
everyone involved in this is going to face prosecution.
this is Curtis Manning.
release Bill Buchanan from holding and inform Division that he's been reinstated as director of CTU under Section 112 provisions.
everyone, get back to your stations.
fill me in. Chloe and Edgar detected chatter indicating a possible attack on President Suvarov's motorcade en route to the airport.
how'd they get Suvarov's route?
we don't know, but the most likely point of intercept is the downtown corridor.
has Secret Service been notified? Lynn refused to do so.
notify Secret Service now.
I need your level one access code to override the firewall Lynn put up.
here. I need Carrie back.
he fired her for no reason. Have security reinstate her.
Edgar, pull up satellite and all possible intercept points, and call the president.
Yes, sir. Where are we on the location of the nerve gas canisters?
no substantial progress.
what about the lead Jack was following?
he traced the Sentox back to Omicron International where it was manufactured.
is that where Jack is now?
Yes.
Mr. Buchanan, president's on the line.
Mr. President, we have intelligence that indicates President Suvarov's motorcade may be attacked in the next few minutes.
is that so?
Yes, sir.
we are in the process of notifying Secret Service.
what we can tell you is that if the attack happens it will occur in or around the downtown area.
the motorcade is approaching that area now, sir.
Mr. President?
the president is at a loss for words.
his wife is in the Suvarov's limousine.
thank you. You've done a good job.
what do we do?
there's nothing we can do, sir.
CTU is informing the Secret Service.
they'll no doubt take defensive measures, which makes the attack substantially less likely to succeed.
protocol red.
protocol red. Hold on tight.
we're turning around- we just received intelligence about a threat to the motorcade.
they're turning around!
we're under attack!
we need backup now!
it's a missile fire. The motorcade's been hit.
Oh, my God...
are you okay?
Yeah, Frank.
how badly?
and what about Mrs. Logan?
I will. Thank you.
your wife survived the attack.
CTU intervened in time.
thank God.
what about the Suvarovs?
they were shaken up, but, uh, they'll be okay.
he's going to think I tipped off CTU.
it won't matter to him that I tried to keep my end of the bargain.
I agree.
we need to prepare ourselves for Bierko's retaliation.
all the work on the Sentox project was run out of here.
how restricted was the access?
extremely. For security reasons, each defense contract was run out of its own separate dedicated bunker, each bunker's a completely sealed environment.
nothing gets in and nothing gets out.
this is gonna take some time.
I've got to merge some files, find out who's working on this project.
you're Senior Vice President and you don't know?
give me a break, Jack- there's 8, 000 people that work for this company.
I got to run a sort- it's gonna take me a minute.
so who's the honcho over at CTU now?
Buchanan. What a stiff.
no wonder everything's going to hell over there.
you guys keep getting rid of everybody who can do their job.
you made your own bed.
you accused the wrong man, Jack.
I wasn't the lead investigator; I showed them what I found.
I was framed. By who?
Nina Myers, George Mason... Who knows?
but I'll tell you, the one thing that just hangs on me,
I'll tell you, the one thing that just...
hurts me is that you didn't believe me.
you made it impossible to believe you.
how could I possibly defend you?
you wouldn't even defend yourself.
no one gave me the chance.
okay, we got something here.
lead scientist, head of Project Sentox
alan Burkett, PhD.
I'm gonna need to speak to him.
well, you're gonna have a problem.
died in a helicopter crash in Geneva two years ago.
let's see what else we got.
this is bizarre.
two other senior scientists on the Sentox project
one drowned on a diving trip in the Bahamas, the other burned to death in a car accident two weeks later.
what the hell is going on?
CTU's gonna have to break it down.
how do I upload the files and get them ready to transfer?
we need I. T.
they're next-door.
I'll get somebody to help us.
I'll CTU know that we're sending the files over.
Hello?
damn it.
Oh, my God.
how could I be so stupid?
yes? Yeah, it's me.
I listened to everything Bauer had to say about the thumb drive
CTU does not have enough information to hurt us.
what about Bauer?
well, in about one minute, he'll be dead.
tell the media we don't know
how the terrorists found out about the Suvarovs' route.
we're looking into it now.
Mike, I've been thinking that...
diplomatically, we should play up the fact that Martha was in the vehicle.
why is that, sir?
it will get rid of any suspicion that we might have been...
shortchanging Suvarov's security.
there he is.
hello.
I thought we had an understanding.
I had nothing to do with this. You have to believe me.
it was your job to make sure no one interfered with the attack on the Suvarovs.
it happened outside of my authority.
I told no one.
if Russia isn't going to pay with the life of its president, then its new ally, the United States, will pay with the lives of its citizens.
Mr. President, this is our final conversation.
good-bye. No. Wait!
Jack, we've authenticated the thumb-drive data.
Omicron definitely made the Sentox for the military.
who is this Henderson?
someone I used to work for. - Where?
CTU. He's the man who recruited me.
things ended badly between us.
what are accusing me now of, Jack, being in bed with terrorists?
I need complete access to Omicron's Sentox program.
I've got to merge some files, find out who was working on this project.
we need I.T.
they're next door.
I listened to everything Bauer had to say about the thumb-drives.
CTU does not have enough information to hurt us.
what about Bauer?
well, in about one minute, he'll be dead.
Oh, my God...
how could I be so stupid?
Mr. McGill, we think there might be an attack on President Suvarov's motorcade.
my people are not going to chase that white elephant.
they're busy trying to locate 19 canisters of Sentox nerve gas.
now let my people focus on their work, or I will have you escorted out of here!
Lynn is mentally incapable of running CTU.
what are you suggesting?
section 112.
Curtis, take Mr. Stiles and Ms. O'Brian, put them in holding, and then escort Audrey Raines out of CTU.
Lynn McGill, I'm relieving you of your command under the "incapacity clause" of section 112.
Mrs. Logan is riding with the Suvarovs.
get my wife on the phone.
the terrorists were very specific:
if I don't allow them to attack the motorcade, they're going to release canisters of nerve gas in multiple locations.
you need to get out of the car!
we're under attack; we need backup now!
I thought we had an understanding.
it happened outside of my authority.
I told no one.
if Russia isn't going to pay with the life of its president, then its new ally, the United States, will pay with the lives of its citizens.
Mr. President, this is our final conversation. Good-bye.
no... Wait!
the following takes place between 5pm and 6pm
how long has he been conscious?
ten minutes.
before you go in, you should be aware of something.
Tony's been asking for his wife.
he doesn't remember?
he remembers the explosion, but that's all.
we have to tell him Michelle is dead.
no, absolutely not.
he's undergone severe trauma. This kind of stress will raise his blood pressure and make the vascular damage worse.
please, just hold off on telling him until his condition has stabilized.
would you excuse us, please?
how are you feeling?
they told me they took Michelle to Cedars.
Yes, they couldn't treat her here.
Why? How badly was she hurt?
is she going to be okay?
as far as I know, yes.
what the hell's going on here, Bill?
they killed President Palmer, and they tried to kill Michelle and me.
david Palmer was the primary target.
they killed him because he was going to expose someone inside Logan's administration.
they set Jack up to take the fall.
did they get Jack?
no. He's alive.
he's working with us here on a provisional basis.
bill, I need to talk to Jack.
you need to rest. - No, I don't need to rest.
I need to talk to Jack. Now.
I'll tell him.
Thanks.
could you do me a favor?
could you get a message to Michelle?
tell her I'm okay.
I will.
we need you to get better.
copy, Blacktop One.
we're standing by.
the Navy helicopter is on its way, ma'am.
it'll take us back to the retreat.
he...
didn't warn the motorcade.
ma'am?
he knew about the attack, and...
he just let it happen, Aaron.
that can't be true.
he didn't just let it happen. He...
he gave the terrorists the Suvarovs' motorcade route.
ma'am, why would he do that?
how soon before you're ready?
I'll be leaving in a couple of minutes.
I just need to finish setting the arming mechanism.
make sure you place the canister to maximize casualties.
it must look as if this is one of our primary targets.
it'll be taken care of.
Ostroff Yes?
do you have the key card yet?
I'll have it within the hour.
they're can be no miscues.
I'm using up one of my canisters to create this diversion.
without the key card, it's all for nothing.
call me when you have it.
I will.
hello.
I'm going to be there soon.
make sure you bring the money.
you'll have it.
and you'll have your precious card.
careful.
it's all we got left.
don't worry about it.
in a little while, be able to buy all you want.
Mrs. Logan and the Suvarovs have been treated.
the chopper is picking them up now.
what do I say to my wife, Mike?
she put you in an impossible situation...
it's my job to handle impossible situations, and I failed, and not for the first time.
Mr. President... - I should never have given in.
I should have ordered back the motorcade.
sir, with all due respect, you don't have time for self-recrimination.
the terrorists' attack failed.
we have to assume they'll make good on their threat to use the Sentox on American soil.
has CTU made any progress, or are they just waiting for the other shoe to drop?
they're looking for a lead, working the scene where the motorcade was ambushed.
they're airlifting the bodies of the terrorists to CTU.
when will they be here?
any minute. I'm meeting them in the morgue.
let me know what you find.- You got it.
Jack's calling in.
put him on speaker.
Jack, we're in an emergency briefing with department heads.
bill wants to put you on speaker.
I thought Lynn took Bill off the active roster.
bill's been reinstated, and Lynn's been relieved of duty.
okay, fine. Put me on.
all right
all right. You're on.
Jack, it's Bill.
what did you find at Omicron?
christopher Henderson was responsible for setting up the deal that allowed the terrorists to gain control of the Sentox.
he just tried to kill me by blowing up a bunker that the Sentox was developed in.
I managed to survive, but unfortunately the servers that control the data were destroyed and Henderson managed to escape.
Chloe, are you there?
go ahead, Jack.
can you hack into Henderson's office computer?
I already did it.
Henderson's home workstation is clean.
he wiped his hard drive five minutes ago.
there's still an active socket.
what's that mean?
it means he's exchanging data with an off-site link.
can you locate it?
Yeah. The registry listing is 5714 Tarawood Drive, Toluca Lake.
that's his home address.
I'll send a tac team.
no, Bill. I need to go in alone. - Why?
Henderson's good; he'll be able to detect a tac team moving in.
how do you want to play this, Jack?
he left me for dead. I'm the last person he expects to see.
I should be able to walk up to his front door.
all right. But I want you in constant contact with CTU.
right now, Henderson is our primary link to finding this nerve gas.
I know. I'll get back to you.
you've reached the private client line for Banco Buenos Aires.
please leave a message at the tone or press the star button for immediate assistance.
client identification code, please.
how can I help you, Mr. Henderson?
I'd like after-hours access to my personal safety deposit box, please.
yes
bill, we found a schematic of some kind of ventilation system on one of the terrorists. It's from the Suvarov attack.
since that's the most efficient way to deliver the Sentox, this could potentially be their next target.
do we know what building the schematic is from?
not yet. But I sent a copy off to Building and Safety.
they're running it against their archive.
upload it to Chloe and Edgar. I want them working on this, too.
better make it fast.
there's a number handwritten in the margin
18: 00 hours.
that means the attack could happen in the next hour.
Yeah.
that was Curtis.
he's going to upload a set of schematics to our server.
this is the likely target of their next attack.
there was a time-stamp on it.
the attack could occur sometime in the next hour.
where is it? We don't know.
the only thing Curtis could tell at first glance is that it's the ventilation system in some kind of industrial building.
how big?
big enough to hold several thousand people.
let's find it.
how you doing, Tony?
fine.
have you heard anything else on my wife's condition?
I haven't heard anything new.
sorry.
you'll have to get back to Recovery.
get away from me.
Mr. Almeida, please... - I said get away from me!
Tony, come on.
thank God that you're all right.- Let go of me, or I'll...
Martha, please... - Listen, don't touch me.
Martha, I'm sorry. I made a mistake.
I didn't think that I had any choice.
it isn't just that you...
you didn't stand up to them.
you should have stood up to them.
Yuri, Anya, I can't tell you how glad I am that you're both all right.
thank you.
it was awful.
I'm deeply embarrassed that something like this could happen on U. S. soil, but I promise you, whoever did this will be brought to justice.
excuse me, Mr. President.
of course.
we both know who is responsible for this.
we believe it was the same group who attacked Ontario Airport this morning, but we thought that they were all killed in the siege.
obviously, you were wrong.
the situation is much more serious than you know.
these terrorists have possession of a military-grade nerve agent.
and they've threatened to use it against the civilian population of Los Angeles.
how long have you known this?
we just found out about it.
but given this change of circumstances,
I'm asking you to honor the terms of our treaty.
allow my intelligence and law enforcement agencies access to whatever intelligence your security people have on these separatists.
you will have our help.
thank you, sir.
Mr. President,
I hope you won't find this offensive, but there's something that's been troubling me.
what is it?
Mrs. Logan- her behavior.
she has not been herself.
I'm sure that she is very upset by what just happened.
Yes, I imagine she would be, but
I noticed this before the attack.
from the time she entered the car with Anya and me.
Yuri, the truth is, my wife has been under a doctor's care for quite a while now.
she suffers from depression and anxiety.
it's been very difficult for both of us.
I'm sorry to hear that.
thank you.
guard said you wanted to see me?
how long are you going to keep me here?
you're not going out there any time today, Lynn.
district Marshal's reviewing your case.
I need to ask you a favor, Bill.
I know I don't deserve it.
I was unfair to you earlier.
what is it?
I need to make a phone call.
Lynn, if you think you can get out of this with a few phone calls, you're mistaken.
I won't let that happen.
it's not that, I swear it.
I'll give you the number, you can clear it yourself.
what's this about?
my sister.
I need to talk to her about a personal matter.
it can't wait a few hours?
no, it can't.
bill, please, she's in a little bit of trouble and I'm the only one who can help her.
I don't need to clear it.
get Mr. McGill a phone. Give him some privacy.
thank you.
thank you.
hello.
Jenny, it's me.
listen,
I don't care that you took my wallet.
keep everything that's in there.
I just need to get my key card back.
what key card?
my CTU access card.
it's of no value to you. It just lets me in and out of this building.
well, can't you just get them to give you a new one?
I mean, that's what I did when I lost the key to my laundry room.
damn it, Jenny, this isn't a laundry room.
this is a secure government building.
now, if you don't want me to call the police, you'll get me back the key card today.
you hear me?
Yeah, I do.
listen, I got to go.
Where's that card from Lynn's wallet?
Why?
cause I want to give him back his key card. We don't need it.
that's how I'm getting us all this money.
you told me we were just going to take his cash and a credit card.
Yeah, we're taking a credit card.
$20, 000 line of credit, right here.
$20, 000?
who's going to pay you that kind of money?
Yes, Mr. President?
I'd like to speak with my wife.
I'm sorry, sir. She asked to be left alone.
Evelyn, I want to see my wife now.
move away from the door.
sir, she ordered me not to let anyone in.
I'm not anyone, Evelyn.
I know, sir, but she specifically mentioned you.
I have to get to a meeting.
would you please tell my wife that I would like to speak with her?
of course, Mr. President.
thank you.
I'd like you to find Aaron Pierce right now.
I want to know how he's doing.
is there a message you want me to get to him?
if he's all right, tell him I'd like to see him.
Chloe, come here.
I think I got a match.
there's a discrepancy here.
that's because they're from two different layers.
the one Curtis had was structural, but this is an electrical blueprint.
you're right. Mr. Buchanan.
Edgar matched the schematics we got from Curtis.
where is it? - Tyler Memorial.
a hospital.
tell Curtis to activate a tac team.
I'll call Tyler Memorial, tell them to evacuate.
put me through the Tyler Memorial hospital
this is Bauer. I'm on-site at the Henderson house.
do you copy?
Jack, we found intel in the body of a dead terrorist.
there is going to be an attack.
where? - Tyler Memorial Hospital.
we think it's happening within the hour.
okay, I copy.
I'm moving in now
who?
Christopher's wife.
he's not here.
tell Chloe I'll get back to her as soon as I have access to his computer.
all right, we're on it.
this is Curtis Manning with CTU.
I need to speak to the ranking security officer on site.
you're talking to him. Tom Wegman.
Mr. Wegman, I'm heading to you now with a tactical team.
the nerve gas will most likely be released into a ventilation unit.
you need to seal off the sub-basement.
I've called in a second security shift.
we'll get that area locked down. - Good.
how long before the hospital's evacuated?
uh, an hour, maybe two.
this attack could occur within the next 30 minutes.
this is a large facility, Agent Manning.
we have 600 patients, many of whom need assistance.
Mr. Wegman, if this nerve agent is released into the ventilation system, everyone inside that building will die.
do what you have to do, but get those people out of that building.
right.
Hello, Miriam.
Oh, my God.
we thought you were dead.
where is he?
what are you doing, Jack?
Miriam, where's Christopher?
he's still at work.
did he call you?
you're scaring me.
in the last hour, has he called you?!
no.
now tell me what the hell is going on.
I need to see his computer.
what are you doing?
where is his computer?!
I'm not going to tell you anything until you tell me what is going on.
christopher developed a chemical weapons system called Sentox-VX nerve gas for Omicron.
he enabled terrorists to gain control of it, now it's being used against civilian targets in Los Angeles.
so where is his computer?!
Miriam, I am telling you the truth.
we have proof that he brokered the deal.
that's impossible.
less than an hour ago he tried to kill me.
move towards the living room.
keep walking towards the den.
I want you to take a seat on the couch.
look, why don't we just call him? I'm sure there's an explanation.
Miriam, take a seat.
you don't need the gun, Jack.
you are not gonna shot me
Chloe, it's Jack.
I need access to Henderson's hard drive.
I need you to talk me through it.
OK, Jack
yes?
you wanted to see me, ma'am?
Oh, yes, Aaron, come in.
I- I didn't really get a chance to say thank you before.
you saved my life.
I know that you'll say it was all just in the line of duty.
you're welcome.
the country's lucky to have men like you.
I'm lucky.
I hope you'll allow me to say that.
Mrs. Logan.
would you excuse us, Aaron?
what is it, Mike?
the President's been trying to reach you.
I know.
but I don't want to see him.
would you like me to convey that to the President?
you can convey whatever you want, Mike.
Mike, I want you to know nothing happened in there.
whatever didn't happen, make sure it doesn't happen again.
Yeah. - Tom Wegman, hospital security.
thanks for mobilizing your people so quickly.
have you uplinked with CTU yet?
we're doing that now.
we've doubled security at all sub-basement ingress points
nobody's getting down there unless they go through us.
good.
the bad news is we have 26 patientin ICU that can't be moved.
seven of them are high-dependency newborns.
we can't even relocate them without the specialized transport units which we don't have on site.
what about nearby hospitals?
all neonatal transport units are in service.
all right, thanks.
I want a visual sweep of all high-probability target points within the hospital.
team A, start at the north end, Team B take south. Move.
yes Sir
it's Viktor.
I'm at the hospital.
and why are you calling me?
they must have found out about the attack.
the hospital's being evacuated.
all of the elevators and stairwells are guarded.
calm down, Viktor.
bring up the schematics of the hospital.
there's another entrance to the sub-basement.
an electrical conduit.
there's a good chance it isn't guarded.
how do I find it?
in the Radiology wing down corridor six.
call us when you're there. We'll talk you through it.
I'll call you in a few minutes.
Viktor, I need you to finish this task, even if it means you don't get out.
I won't fell you
d
we were given a name.
he made billions in the post-Soviet economy- weapons and oil.
he bankrolled several underground radical publications promoting the separatist cause, but it's believed that he was more than just a sympathizer.
the Russians think he's financing these attacks?
they think that he's directing the attacks himself.
based on what?
a number of communiques that were intercepted by Russian security force, supported by the fact that Bierko vanished from Russia three months ago.
we posted Bierko's profile to the interagency servers.
homeland Security has issued an emergency brief to local law enforcement.
do you think there's any hope of finding him before the attack on Tyler Hospital?
the most promising lead we have is a man named Christopher Henderson.
unfortunately, he escaped.
Jack Bauer believes there may be files on Henderson's computer that could lead us to Bierko.
he's trying to acquire those files now, sir.
well, let's hope he succeeds, Bill.
the country's already suffered three devastating attacks today.
we need to stop this madman.
Yes, Mr. President.
Chloe, it's Jack. Have you found anything yet?
the only thing on Henderson's hard drive is domestic stuff:
bill-paying programs, downloaded music.
Chloe, Henderson isn't trading music files with his office.
there's something else on the computer. Find it.
I'm doing the best I can.
why don't you face it, Jack?
christopher is innocent.
he was innocent when you forced him out of CTU, and he's innocent now.
maybe you didn't hear me earlier, Miriam, he tried to kill me.
if he did, then he was defending himself.
no, he blew up the server room at Omicron while I was still inside.
he was destroying evidence that would have implicated him in this conspiracy.
this is so familiar.
you're accusing him of being a criminal.
why do you hate him so much?
I want you to know something.
Chris never hated you, not even after what you did to him.
when he thought you were dead, he looked in on Kim.
he cared about your daughter, Jack, just like he cared about you.
we both did. You know that.
I found something, Jack.
what is it?
it's a shadow drive. It was partitioned from the primary hard drive.
what's on the shadow drive?
a backup log that contains data points for every satellite phone call Henderson has made in the last year.
can you cross-reference those numbers with the telephone numbers the terrorists used earlier this morning?
I got into the log, but the phone lists are password-protected.
hold on.
christopher had a secret file on his computer.
there's a list of numbers.
and that implicates him?
we need access to that list.
do you know the password?
no, I don't.
Miriam, we believe there's going to be another attack within 30 minutes.
thousands of lives are at stake.
please, if you know that password, I need it now.
I can't help you.
Chloe, you're going to have to try and hack into it.
I'll see what I can do. - Hurry.
I'll show this to Manning. - Good work.
agent Manning?
one of our guards caught this.
this guy's dressed as an orderly, but I've never seen him before.
an orderly has no business being where he is.
that was five minutes ago.
where is this?
sub-basement.
team A, meet me in the southeast stairwell.
team B, form a soft perimeter.
we have a possible suspect in play.
CTU, did you copy that? - Yes, we copy.
Edgar, I need you to uplink the hospital video surveillance for facial recognition software. See if you can get a match.
got it
Curtis has a suspect.
we're running the image through facial recognition.
halfway through the database.
got something. - All right, put it up.
Curtis, we have a suspect.
his name is Viktor Grigorin.
he's a Russian national.
served time for drug smuggling and weapons trafficking.
copy that.
all teams, suspect is a confirmed hostile.
Freeze!
don't move!
agent Manning, you need to come look at this.
search him.
don't!
it might be set to go off if it's moved.
chemical Response Team, we need you down here now.
all teams, we've located the canister, and it is on.
repeat, the canister is on
CTU, Chemical Response Team is on the way in.
the hospital evacuation is still in progress.
there are still a lot of people in here.
copy that, Curtis.
Edgar, notify LAPD and all relevant agencies.
I want a mandatory evacuation of the downtown core.
Yes, sir.
Jack, Henderson is using an interlaced encryption key.
what does that mean?
it could take me a half a day to crack it.
damn it, Chloe, we don't have that kind of time.
I'm sorry. It's a little tougher than it looked at first glance, okay?
Yeah. All right.
Jack, you should know that Curtis and his team intercepted a terrorist at the hospital.
did they take him into custody?
no. He's dead.
but they found a nerve gas canister.
they're trying to disarm it now.
there are patients there that can't be evacuated.
Chloe, listen to me.
there's nothing you can do about the hospital.
there's still 18 canisters out there. I need you to stay focused.
I know.
if I got you more personnel, would that help you crack the code faster?
I've already got three analysts working on it, Jack.
Miriam? Honey, I want you to pack a bag. I want you...
don't you move!
Miriam, sit back down!
put your hands behind your head.
get back up on your knees.
now!
I want you to handcuff yourself.
behind your back.
get up.
take a seat next to Miriam on the couch.
you okay, honey?
okay.
how do I find the nerve gas?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
where is it?
that's right, Jack. Start at my knee, just like I taught you.
sooner you do it, sooner you'll see I don't know what you're talking about.
where is it?!
he doesn't know, Jack! He doesn't know!
for God's sake, leave him alone!
CTU found one of the canisters at Tyler Memorial Hospital.
it's armed!
people are going to start dying.
how do I find the nerve gas?
Jack, leave him alone!
he doesn't know anything!
you really trust him?
ask him what's in the briefcase.
unlock it!
ask him what he's doing with all the money!
ask him!
is this true? Have you been lying to me all this time?
I've been protecting you all this time.
by lying? - It's not that simple, Miriam.
I defended you. - I defended you, too, against things you would not want to know because I love you, Miriam.
there's not one thing I've done out of self-interest or greed.
even when they fired me- even when they framed me
I served my country.
I don't care how you justify this.
I am out of time.
you are going to tell me now how to find the rest of the nerve gas.
Oh, go ahead and do it, Jack.
get it done. Shoot me.
kneecap me. Go ahead and do it.
do it!
you son of a bitch! - I shot her above the kneecap!
son of a bitch! - She can still walk!
you make me shoot her again, she'll be in a wheelchair for the rest of her life!
damn you! - Where do I find the nerve gas?!
damn you!
where is it?
please, please, baby.
don't you make me do this.
tell him what he wants to know.
I can't.
forgive me, Miriam. I can't.
you son of a bitch.
you don't care about anybody.
not even her.
Chloe, this is Jack.
I need an ambulance on site.
I repeat: I need an ambulance on site.
Miriam Henderson's been shot in the leg.
I'm bringing Christopher Henderson in to CTU.
I'll need an interrogation room prepped, and a medic standing by with hyocine-pentothal.
it'll be ready when you get here.
you okay, Jack?
Yeah, I'm fine. Just get the ambulance here now.
team's on its way.
put Buchanan on.
Mr. Buchanan, Jack's on line one.
Jack, it's Bill.
what's happening at the hospital?
there's a CRT team on site.
stand by, Jack.
Curtis, what's your status?
we're still trying to defuse the detonator.
look what we found on the hostile.
it's an evacuational track
hold on, Bill.
it's a remote timing display.
can we defuse the detonator?
not in 60 seconds.
we'll have to get it out of here.
it could go off if we move it.
it's a chance I'm gonna have to take.
all teams, we're moving the canister to the containment unit.
all right, go, go, go, go, go!
go, go, go, go, go, go! Move, move!
all teams, clear the whole clear the whole, we are coming through, go go go go go
make sure the doors and exigencies are open
make sure the doors and exigencies are open
go , come on
go go go move move move
go go go! Get out of the way!
get out of the way!
everybody clear!
go, go, go!
all right, get 'em out of the way!
go, move the whole, clear clear
move! Move, move!
move back
get that door open!
come on! Get that thing sealed!
we have make it pressed
we're clear!
the canister detonated inside a containment unit.
the hospital's safe.
good work, Curtis.
I have the key card.
how long will it take for you to reprogram it?
five minutes. Then we will be able to use it to access CTU.
good.
CTU is being absorbed by the department of homeland security, and christopher henderson remains an open protocol.
ms. Raines signed a detailed statement documenting the numerous missteps made today by ctu, and by you, in particular.
I don't understand, why am I staying and everybody else is being let go?
because ms. Raines requested that you keep your position.
I had to keep karen from replacing you, that's why I signed the document,
I didn't have a choice.
why were those men trying to kill you?
david had a source inside the white house.
who's the source?
Mrs. Logan's assistant.
I have proof about who's behind everything that's happened today.
someone killed david...
and they just tried to kill me.
I have to go now... - give me what I need!
they kidnapped my little girl.
I promise you we're going to get your daughter back.
I already told them I wouldn't give up any information until I have my daughter.
we need henderson alive;
do not shoot to kill.
did you bring what we discussed?
I have the evidence with me.
I want my daughter.
she's moving.
give me the evidence, evelyn.
now.
Wayne, I didn't get him
if you got a shot, take it!
Chloe, it's jack, henderson escaped in evelyn's car!
do you have him on satellite?
we can't lose him!
Evelyn's been hit.
it's not serious, but it's gonna have to be dressed.
Evelyn, you've got your daughter back, now tell me what I need to know.
who is behind this?
is it the vice president?
the vice president has nothing to do with this!
you promised me you would control the situation.
I didn't count on jack bauer showing up, sir.
Bauer and wayne palmer won't be around long enough to tell anybody else what they know.
I will not let you down.
see that you don'T.
okay, evelyn, I need you to stay focused.
the recording of the phone call that you made between president logan and henderson is in a safety deposit box
which bank?
which bank?
city trust and savings in agoura hills.
Where's the key?
my jacket pocket.
mom?
it's all right, sweetheart, your mom's going to be fine.
she's going to be fine, okay?
Jack, you heard what they said.
we have to get off this road, there are military patrols everywhere.
there's a motel up there on the right.
turn in there.
I want to go home.
we're gonna get you home, honey.
we're gonna get you home.
Wayne, can you get us a room.
I'll keep watch.
make sure you keep pressure on the wound,
I'll be right back.
Hello? - Audrey, it's jack.
have you got henderson on satellite yet?
no, chloe wasn't able to reposition in time.
damn it!
are you still on a secure line?
Yes. Why, what's going on?
Evelyn didn't implicate gardner.
she implicated president logan.
Oh, my god, jack.
Logan? Are you sure?
she said he was responsible for everything that happened today, starting with providing the terrorists with the nerve gas.
that's what david palmer found out.
that's why they killed him.
are you saying that president logan ordered palmer's assassination?
Henderson gave the order.
but evelyn says she has evidence that shows that president logan was complicit.
what kind of evidence?
she recorded a conversation earlier this morning between henderson and president logan.
she put it in a safety deposit box in a bank.
we're on our way to get it now.
Jack, the city is under martial law.
I know. I need you to upload every military checkpoint to my pda so we can navigate our way around them.
all right, I'll take care of that.
Audrey, as soon as I have the recording, we're going to have to involve your father.
we need someone in the government, someone credible, to present the evidence.
all right.
he's on his way back from a summit in japan.
I'll call him on the plane.
okay. Make sure you leave ctu before you do anything.
you don't think that they can be trusted?
right now, we can't trust anyone.
Logan will have every federal law enforcement agency, the military, all at his disposal.
and he will use them to try and stop us.
don't fill your father in on the particulars.
just try and set up the meeting.
I'll get back to you as soon as I have the recording.
all right, I'll upload those checkpoints. - Yeah.
the bank manager was listed.
that's his address, he's not far.
good. Let's get them in the room.
hey... we need to get inside now.
come on, it's okay.
give me your arm.
you can sit right here, okay?
okay. Lie down here on the bed.
I'm sorry, but it's not safe enough to take you to a hospital yet.
let me see, let me see.
take amy outside for a second.
come on, sweat okay, even though the bullet went through,
I'm still going to have to clean out this wound.
it's gonna hurt.
but I promise you
I'll get you to a hospital as soon as I can.
in the meantime,
I'm going to have wayne look after you.
no. I'll be fine.
you need to get the evidence.
and you'll need help.
are you sure?
Yeah.
okay.
keep pressure on it.
sweetheart, you can see your mom now.
give me the car keys.
let's go.
I haven't been able to pick up bauer's trail yet.
so he got away.
and there's nothing to stop him and wayne palmer from going to the media with everything they know.
Jack knows there's no point in going public until he has proof.
he won't make any accusations until he has that evidence in his hand.
this evidence, this...
this recording that evelyn made of our conversation.
are you any closer to finding out where she's hidden it?
no, sir, not yet.
but she was wounded, and I will find her;
we're monitoring hospitals, emergency services.
this is containable,
I promise you.
please spare me your promises, mr. Henderson.
it's all gone wrong.
none of this should have happened.
all these killings...
this whole thing was planned to make our country safer.
stronger.
to protect our interests.
and it all spiraled out of control when you decided to kill david palmer.
Mr. President, what's done is done.
and right now, we have to focus on stopping bauer before he finds that recording.
no.
you have to focus on it.
why haven't the analysts finished the hourlies?
they're still getting up to speed on ctu's protocols.
we knew this wasn't going to be a seamless transition.
sometimes I wonder if it was even a necessary one.
CTU's performance today has been considerably less than stellar.
dozens of people have been killed.
and they weren't even able to prevent an attack on themselves.
do you really believe, under the circumstances, that we could have done any better?
ms. Hayes?
the president is on line one.
put him through to bill buchanan's office,
I'll be working out of there from now on.
and have medical notify me as soon as bierko has regained consciousness.
Yes, mr. President?
do you know where jack bauer is?
not at the moment, sir.
he was due back here 30 minutes ago to lead the bierko interrogation.
he's gone off grid.
I'm not surprised.
Karen, I'm issuing an executive order for the immediate apprehension and arrest of jack bauer.
I want you to run point on this, and I want you to make this ctu's top priority.
Yes, sir.
for purposes of the warrant,
I'll need to know what bauer's being charged with.
his role in the assassination of president david palmer.
but I understood that he'd been exonerated of that charge, sir.
you, yourself, reinstated his credentials.
I know, but I didn't have all the facts then.
some new evidence has come to light.
new evidence?
Yes.
I'm looking at it right now, and I will forward it to you at the appropriate time.
Yes, sir.
obviously, this is a very sensitive matter, and for now I would like you to treat the origin of this warrant as confidential.
understood, sir.
put out an alert on jack bauer to all federal law enforcement agencies and nsa.
I'll also get military the warrant
they have more men on the street than anyone.
I don't like this.
pulling our resources off finding christopher henderson to go after jack bauer without knowing the evidence?
it's a direct order from the president.
you know, if we really want to find bauer, we need to keep watch on anyone he might contact for help.
starting with audrey raines.
what's this?
Chloe, open it up and make it look like this is what we're talking about.
okay...
can you get me a secure channel, so the calls on my cell phone can't be monitored?
using a vpn pathway, sure.
take somebody about an hour to crack.
why, what's going on?
I just spoke with jack.
Gardner isn't the one who's behind this.
it's president logan.
what?
Jack is on his way getting proof.
I'm leaving now to go help him.
take a ctu walkie.
it's a warrant for jack's arrest.
it's starting.
what do we do?
heading out?
Yes, I'm going to try to grab a couple hours of sleep.
I came to talk to both of you about the warrant.
well, let's start with why the hell it was issued.
there's new evidence implicating jack in david palmer's assassination.
that's ridiculous.
I was there when the assassin confessed.
all you have to do is check the log.
I know about the logs, chloe.
my orders are to bring jack in.
new evidence?
have you seen it?
it's forthcoming.
who ordered this, karen?
I'm not at liberty to discuss that.
when was the last time you spoke with jack?
about an hour ago.
we haven't had contact since.
I hope I don't have to remind either one of you that you have a legal obligation to notify me if jack contacts you.
look, I know this may seem odd to the both of you
frankly, it does to me
but let's remember it's in everyone's best interest to bring jack in peacefully.
have a good night.
thank you.
Audrey's on her way.
what's your status?
we're placing the transponder on audrey's car right now.
good.
there won't be many cars on the road, so use the tracker and stay out of sight.
will do.
we don't want anything to stop audrey from leading us to bauer.
that's the house.
okay.
what's the bank manager's name?
you got your gun?
Yeah, but we don't need them for this, do we?
he's not going to let into his bank in the middle of the night unless he thinks he has to.
Jack, why don't we just try telling him the truth?
would you believe it?
the only way we're going to have his full compliance is if he's scared.
if you're uncomfortable with that, you should stay here.
they've got a magnetic alarm.
we're in.
...that will take place within the hour.
at that time, president logan is scheduled to make a statement to the american people about the successful resolution of today's terrorist threat.
did you hear something?
like what?
I don't know.
hang on.
I'll be right back.
don't you move.
rose, call the police...!
cover him.
put the phone down.
put the phone down now!
bring him in here!
just stay calm, and everything will be fine.
let's go
Oh my god. Carl...
take a seat on the bed.
okay, look, our money and jewelry's in floor safe in the closet.
we're not interested in that.
you're gonna get us into your bank.
I can't do that.
it's not that I won'T. I can'T.
the alarm system and the vault only allow entry during business hours.
don't lie to me.
every bank has procedures to allow access during an emergency.
Hey! No, no!
I'll take you to the bank.
slowly get up, get dressed.
go on. It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.
I want four of your neckties.
tie her up to the chair.
ankles and wrists. Make sure she doesn't move.
come on.
Yes, hi. This is audrey raines.
I need to speak with secretary heller, please.
Mr. Secretary, there's a call coming in for you on an over-air encrypted channel.
it's your daughter.
Audrey, is everything okay?
Hi. Uh, yes, I'm okay.
dad, I need your help.
is this a secure line?
very secure.
is this about the arrest order for jack?
I was just informed.
dad, I can't go into details right now, but jack is innocent. He's being set up.
set up by whom?
what the hell is going on, audrey?
you call me this morning, to tell me that jack's alive.
now I get word he's a suspect again in the palmer assassination.
dad, I can't talk to you about it right now.
I need to see you in person.
can you reroute your plane to los angeles?
dad, I would never ask you to do this if it wasn't extremely important.
all right, yes.
thank you.
the closest airport is van nuys.
we're about an hour out.
I'll call you on final approach.
okay. Thank you. I'll see you there.
I'll see you.
Yes, sir.
we have to make a stop in L. A.
and keep it off the manifest.
Yes, sir.
pull over.
she stopped.
corner of alderton and davis.
it's a gas station.
Chloe, it's me.
hold on.
okay, switched over to my own vpn.
now they can't monitor either end of the conversation.
do you have the walkie?
Yeah. Hang on.
all right, what do I do with it?
tune to proprietary channel 17, turn the sensitivity up all the way.
see if you pick up a pilot signal.
okay, hold on.
Wow. Do you hear that?
that's what I figured--they put a tracker on you.
I found it. All right, chloe, I got it. Thank you.
Audrey, you need to disable your phone by taking the battery out as soon as you can.
all right, I have to wait for a call from jack and then I will.
Yes.
sir, it's almost time.
Yes.
the press conference.
that's right.
Mr. President, if I could have a moment...
uh, I should be done with my statement shortly, hal.
this is potentially time sensitive, sir.
I just got an alert that a warrant has been issued for jack bauer.
thank you, aaron.
Yes, sir.
what about the warrant?
well, it's an executive branch warrant.
I didn't issue it, so it must have come from you.
that's right, it came from me.
well, as you've put me in charge of overseeing ctu and the homeland security transfer, don't you think you should have discussed it with me first?
I appreciate everything you've done today, hal, but the last time I checked, i was still commander in chief.
of course, mr. President, but jack bauer?
it doesn't make any sense.
we should be treating that man like a hero.
I've gone over the logs.
Walt cummings has confessed that he arranged palmer's assassination, framing bauer.
well, clearly, cummings was protecting bauer.
Why?
I don't know why.
but the fact remains I have received confirmation from intelligence sources that jack bauer was, without question, the shooter.
which sources? That's enough!
I'm not going to stand here and have my orders challenged.
you have concerns, hal.
we'll sort this all out once bauer's in custody.
does that suit you?
Yes, sir.
good.
mom?
I'm coming.
sweetheart, it's okay.
mom! Mom!
911. What's your emergency?
my mom-- she passed out.
I can't wake her up.
calm down. Tell me your name.
Amy. My mom's name is evelyn.
what's your mom's last name?
her name's evelyn martin.
all right, honey, now tell me where you are.
Yeah.
sir, a call is coming in to the 911 operator from a motel 6 on porter valley drive requesting medical assistance for an evelyn martin.
be there shortly.
more than an hour ago, federal counter-terrorist agents, under my direction, thwarted the latest attack on innocent civilians, the nature of which was kept secret due to national security.
this was done with the public's best interest in mind.
he really did it.
ma'am?
he stopped the terrorists, the treaty was signed.
he said he would ride out this crisis, and everything would be okay.
and it is.
I should have trusted him.
Yes, ma'am.
what's wrong, aaron?
I'm just a little battle worn.
they attempted to derail the historic accord...
Jack, why are we stopping here?
there's too many military checkpoints in the area.
they'll stop our car.
we have to go the rest of the way on foot.
how far is the bank from here?
about a quarter of a mile that way.
be right back.
aaron, it's jack.
no, but that makes sense.
the vice president's not the one who's behind this, is he?
no, it's logan.
they're going to have every agency and the military looking for you.
and logan is the only one who can call them off.
as soon as we have the evidence in hand, we're gonna pass it off to secretary of defense heller.
after that, it's not gonna matter.
is there anything i can do for you, jack?
keep your eyes open and watch your back.
will do.
get out of the car.
come on.
let's go.
move, move.
take cover, go!
not a word.
ms. Hayes, valerie harris is on line two for you.
she says it's urgent.
Valerie, what's happening?
we lost audrey raines.
what?
she found the tracker and transferred it to a dwp truck at a gas station.
damn it. How did she find it? She's got no field experience.
I don't know.
the only reason we discovered it is the dwp guy stopped to check a faulty power line.
all right, hold your position and wait for my instructions.
will do.
Audrey raines ditched her transponder.
I need you to redirect satellite surveillance and track her.
I can redirect caltrans and maybe one sat-link, but the rest are dedicated to finding bauer.
following audrey should lead us right to bauer.
just get it done and tell me when you've got something.
I'm on it.
against the wall.
watch him.
just do what he says, carl.
do what he says and you'll be home before you know it.
right.
what's the emergency procedure to enter the bank?
I have 30 seconds to put my key in the alarm panel, then I enter my code.
you enter the wrong code and alert the police, all I have to do is make one call, your wife is dead.
you understand me?
Yes.
let's go.
Where's the vault?
take us around the back, stay away from the windows.
how do I open it?
there's a 12-digit code, but it's a timed unlock procedure, which allows enough time for the police to arrive in the event that someone should trigger the silent alarm.
write the code down for me.
take him over to one of the desks, keep an eye on him.
I know you.
no, you don'T.
Yes, I do. You're david palmer's brother.
I saw you on tv this morning.
you were there when he was shot.
now, what the hell are you doing in my bank?
and who is he?
listen, I know it's absurd to ask you to trust me under these circumstances, but believe me, you don't want to know.
Oh, come on.
you threaten me with a gun, you kidnap me, you're robbing my bank.
now, I deserve to know what the hell is going on here.
fine.
Jack and I believe there's evidence inside of one of your safety deposit boxes that's gonna prove who was behind the assassination of my brother, okay?
what's going on?
what do you want me to say, jack?
he recognized me.
it's all right.
Mr. Mossman, how long is the delay before the vault opens?
five minutes. Is that true what he said?
is that why you two are here?
Yes.
why didn't you just wait till morning, get a subpoena?
the people that are behind this will never let it go that far.
they've already tried to kill me twice tonight, carl.
and they're gonna try again the very first chance they get.
mom.
miss martin, you're in shock.
but you're going to be okay.
you know my name?
Where's bauer?
you did? Well, that's good. I'm glad.
I'll get back to you.
I thought you went to bed.
no.
I, watched you with the press.
well, that was morry, and he thought it went pretty well.
good.
but that doesn't begin to describe it.
Charles, you have had to deal with more crisis today than any president in an entire term.
You...were magnificent.
magnificent. Well, I like the sound of that.
especially coming from you.
I'm so proud of you.
I hope I haven't embarrassed you too much as your first lady.
stop. No. Don't be ridiculous.
I mean, you walked up to the edge a couple times, but nobody noticed.
I'll try to find a compliment in there somewhere.
I'm sorry, marty. I didn'T...
no. You had so much on your plate, you didn't need me piling more on.
no, I...please don't say anything. Just accept my apology.
I do. I do, I accept your apology.
I have to take this privately.
who is it?
now, what difference does it make? Please, marty.
I thought the crisis was over. I thought you and I...
all right.
Yes.
we know where bauer is location. Evelyn gave him up.
well, then take care of it.
my men are heading there now.
good. Let me know when it's done.
I'm sorry, honey. I guess I haven't gotten used to the idea that...
that the crisis is over.
when what's done?
what?
you just said,"let me know when it's done.
that was jamey.
I asked her to write me a radio speech for tomorrow morning.
we found audrey raines. Where?
she's heading north toward mulholland.
connect me with harris.
Valerie, we have a fix on raines.
she's heading toward the sepulveda pass, coming up on mulholland.
let's go.
Chloe? Do you have a minute?
no.
what is it?
I was assigned to log all satellite and ground video activity, but part of the vector is locked out.
locked out? What do you mean?
I mean, someone's taken control of one of the satellites using a class one priority override.
do you know anything about it?
no. I'll look into it.
Thanks.
crap.
all points are covered, sir. The perimeter is secure.
do you have a visual?
I did, briefly.
all right, listen. You tell your men the instant, and I mean the instant that bauer steps outside that bank building you take him down.
then, kill the others and secure the recording.
which one is it?
twenty-three.
Mr. Palmer, I admired your brother a great deal. He was a great man.
thank you.
it had to be done, sir.
I decide what needs to be done, mr. Henderson.
I never authorized you to kill david palmer.
Palmer was nosing around.
he'd have found out about your involvement. For god's sake, sir, he called your wife.
I can handle my wife.
right now, my concern is keeping this operation from collapsing like a house of cards.
that's president logan's voice.
every thread ends with cummings.
he thinks he's running this, and you need to keep playing it that way.
I know my part, mr. Henderson.
you just do as you're told.
Oh, my god.
we got what we need.
Mr. Mossman, I'm sorry we put you and your wife through this.
it'll be safer for you to stay here now. Could you please let us out?
like to help if I can. I've come this far.
we're gonna need to borrow your car a little longer.
sure, it's insured.
wait. There's someone inside. Mr. Mossman, get back in the vault now.
is there any other way out of here besides the front door?
no, front door only--security reasons.
damn it.
both of you stay here. I'll be right back.
Henderson's men are taking up positions.
there's no other way out-- we're gonna have to turn ourselves in.
they didn't come here to arrest us; they came here to kill us.
what are they waiting for?
all the windows are bulletproof. They're waiting for us to leave the building.
so what are you gonna do?
how do you trip the silent alarm?
I have a key, but you trip that alarm, lapd will be here within a few minutes.
that's exactly what I want.
Henderson's men outnumber us. We leave this building now, we lose.
Jack, if you call the cops, they're gonna get the recording when we're taken into custody.
we won't be taken into custody.
as soon as henderson finds out the lapd have arrived, he's gonna have his men engage them.
he doesn't want the police to have the recording any more than he wants us to have it.
so they start shooting at each other. How does that help us?
we have to try and use that as a diversion. It's our only way out.
trigger the alarm.
let's get ready.
Valerie. The feed should be coming through to your laptop now.
I've got her.
she's heading west on chandler.
how close are you to audrey's car?
about two miles.
close the gap to one mile.
affirmative.
something's wrong.
the feed's breaking up.
I'm tracing the corruption.
Mr. Mossman, like I said before,
Yes, sir.
Cooper, what's your status?
must have seen you, damn it. Tell your men to move in immediately.
we can't let them have bauer;take 'em down.
Yes, sir.
how is he doing?
he's dead.
Jack, where are you?
I'm on my way to you. Did your father agree to meet?
good, we got the evidence.
Yeah, there's no doubt it's logan.
you understand what this means.
Evelyn, I need youto stay focused.
the recording of the phone call that you made between president logan and henderson is in a safety deposit box. Which bank?
city trust and savings in agoura hills.
Jack knows there's no point in going public till he has that evidence in his hand.
none of this should have happened.
this whole thing was planned to make our country safer.
and it all spiraled out of control when you decided to kill david palmer.
we have to focus on stopping bauer before he finds that recording.
Karen, I'm issuing an executive order for the immediateapprehension and arrest of jack bauer.
I want you to run point on this and I want you to make this ctu's top priority.
understood, sir.
you know, if we really want to find bauer, we need to keep watch on anyone he might contact for help, starting with audrey raines.
don't fill your father in on the particulars.
just set up the meeting.
I'll get back to you as soon as I have the recording.
I need to see you in person.
can you reroute your plane to los angeles?
all right, yes.
I'll see you there.
Jack, are you aware president logan's issued a warrant for your arrest?
the vice president's not the one who's behind this, is he?
no. It's logan.
as soon as we have the evidence in hand, we're going to pass it off to secretary of defense heller.
it had to be done, sir.
I decide what needs to be done, mr. Henderson.
I never authorized you to kill david palmer.
you know what we need.
the instant that bauer steps outside that bank building, you take him down.
kill the others and secure the recording.
we got the evidence.
have you listened to it?
Yeah, there's no doubt it's logan.
we're talking about taking down the president of the united states.
the Follwing Takes Place Between 12: 00 A. M. and 1: 00 A. M.
this checkpoint is just one of many that have been in place for several hours now.
despite his announcement that los angeles is no longer under threat of attack, president logan has ordered that martial law remain in effect.
while the move has drawn criticism from lawmakers and civil rights advocates, the president is defending his decision as a necessary precaution.
he's citing the need...
Yes. - It's me.
is bauer dead?
not yet, mr. President.
you said your men had him.
Bauer triggered the bank alarm.
the authorities came before our men could get to him.
Bauer used the cover of the firefight to slip away.
he has the recording?
Yes, sir.
that evidence directly implicates me in david palmer's death.
only if he gets it to someone who can do something about it.
we'll have bauer before that happens.
how?
Mr. President, you've established direct control over ctu, and ctu is heading up the search effort for bauer.
you're putting an awful lot of faith in their ability.
this city is locked down.
CTU will find bauer, and when they do, make sure you're the first to know so my men can intercept.
Yes, mr. President?
Karen hayes at ctu. Put it through to my office.
we're sifting satellite and caltrans video for audrey raines's vehicle.
I've distributed her file photo to military checkpoints throughout the city.
if she used her dod credentials at any of them, there should be a record.
well, I hope we're not wasting our resources on raines when we don't even know she's helping bauer.
Karen, she dumped the tracker.
there's a reason she doesn't want to be followed.
miss hayes, the president's on line one.
Yes, mr. President.
where are we, ms. Hayes?
still running active manhunts on both jack bauer and christopher henderson.
I told you to prioritize bauer.
I have, sir. I've allocated my resources accordingly.
if david palmer's killer is still at large when the morning news cycle begins, then all the success we've had handling these terrorists will be undermined.
I will find bauer, sir.
you let me know the moment you do.
Yes, mr. President.
Bauer, right?
she knows where he is, and those protocols aren't going to be enough to track her.
you still think chloe helped audrey break surveillance?
I'm sure of it.
remember, audrey insisted chloe be assigned to her.
then we need to confront chloe.
no, no, no, no, no. She'll just deny it.
there's a way we can use her to find bauer.
it's all right. It's him.
bill, over here.
sorry about your brother.
what the hell's going on, jack?
the military authority, every law enforcement agency across this country has a warrant for my arrest.
what for?
killing david palmer.
that's impossible. We cleared you this morning.
I'm being set up again, this time by president logan.
he was complicit in david palmer's assassination.
my god, you're serious.
Logan's using the military to try and stop me from exposing him.
Mr. Buchanan, we have the evidence:
a digital recording of a conversation made between president logan and christopher henderson.
I need to get the recording to secretary heller.
he's gonna take it to the attorney general, and they'll file for the warrant.
but until then, wayne's a target.
I need you to take him somewhere safe.
of course I will.
where are you gonna meet heller?
van nuys airport.
Yeah.
Jack, my father landed. Where are you?
I just dropped wayne palmer off with buchanan.
I'm on my way to the airport now.
all right, I'm on the north side of the emergency runway at hangar 112.
I'll be there in a few minutes.
all right, hurry.
dad.
Hi, sweetheart. - Hi.
thank you so much for doing this.
well, I don't know what it is I'm doing, so don't thank me yet.
these men in your security detail, do you trust them?
with my life.
dad, I need to be sure that they are loyal to you.
what's going on?
dad, I will tell you, but only you.
stay here.
you know I don't like to be kept in the dark.
tell me what this is all about.
I promise, I will.
I just need a minute.
Mr. Secretary.
what the hell are you doing here?
he's a fugitive.
every law enforcement agency in this state is looking for him.
he's innocent.
then why don't you turn yourself in?
Mr. Secretary, I swear to you,
I had nothing to do with david palmer's assassination.
I'd like to believe you, jack, but you're acting like a criminal.
I don't have a choice; they're setting me up.
Mr. Secretary, I only need you for a few minutes.
I need to show you something, but privately, inside the building, please.
thank you, sir.
it had to be done, sir.
I decide what needs to be done, mr. Henderson.
I never authorized you to kill david palmer.
Palmer was nosing around. - President logan?
and a man named christopher henderson.
he'd have found out about your involvement.
for god's sake, sir, he called your wife.
I can handle my wife.
right now, my concern is keeping this operation from collapsing like a house of cards.
you're protected, sir.
every thread ends with cummings.
he thinks he's running this, and you need to keep playing it that way.
I know my part, mr. Henderson.
you just do as you're told.
president logan supplied the terrorists with the sentox nerve gas.
what?
his plan was to deploy the nerve gas en route to moscow.
that way, he could expose the terrorists and use them as an excuse to invoke the military terms of the agreement that he made earlier with suvarov.
this was all in an effort to gain control of the oil supply in central asia.
david palmer found out about it, and that's why they killed him.
how do you know that recording hasn't been fabricated?
I trust the source.
Mr. Secretary, I promise you, this will stand up under scrutiny.
I wish I could say I was surprised, but I'm not.
I watched charles logan rise on the tide of his own ambition.
I was terrified when he took the oath.
sir, I'm very sorry that I had to involve you, but I needed someone who had access to hand-deliver this to the attorney general.
so you contacted me.
you're the only one I could trust.
all right, then.
thank you, sir.
you need to go with your father.
he's going to need someone to corroborate the evidence to the attorney general.
what about you?
I'm going to go dark until the attorney general comes forward.
I'll call buchanan; I'll let him know what's happening.
all right. Jack, everything's going to be okay now.
Yeah. Go.
Jack, one more thing.
what, sir?
dad, what are you doing?! - Secure my daughter.
you're playing a dangerous game here, jack, and you're playing it wrong.
turning logan's crime into a public spectacle will not bring back david palmer.
it'll tear this nation apart.
you're not only destroying the president, you'll be destroying the presidency.
the collateral damage of the truth will cripple this nation.
so what are you going to do? Bury the evidence?
no.
you're coming with me, audrey, and we'll use the evidence to get logan to step down quietly.
once he's gone, we'll have a chance to set things right again.
Doug, I'm trusting you to keep this item safe.
Audrey, are you coming with me or not?
dad, I can'T.
then secure them both until you hear from me.
dad, please, no!
Mr. Secretary, you can't make a deal with him!
you can't trust him!
excuse me.
do you know what's going on in the situation room?
it's some sort of briefing.
no one told me.
it's a class 3. That's all I know.
I'm a department head. I should be in all class 3s.
that's all I know.
shari, what was that briefing about?
just a protocol review.
I don't believe you. - Why not?
cause you're a bad liar.
miles just gave me a bunch of busywork to do in the archives room to keep me out of the briefing.
do you ever think there might be a reason he kept you out?
he thinks I helped audrey break her surveillance.
is that what it was about?
I've already said too much.
please don't ask me any more questions.
come on, shari, you owe me. I stuck my neck out for you with miles.
tell me what happened in there.
miles found audrey. He activated a transponder on her car.
so they know where she is?
we're running an operational support right now.
that's what the briefing was about.
they sent a tac team ten minutes ago.
please don't tell anyone I said anything.
here she comes.
damn, she's good.
she set up a proprietary com channel.
how long will it take to track her call?
not long.
pick up.
somewhere in the valley.
looks like a pay phone.
I've got the receiving end narrowed down to a one-mile radius.
why isn't audrey picking up?
Narrowing...
got it. - Where?
van nuys airport--the emergency runway adjacent to the main field.
move the tac team out now.
van nuys airport. Miles is forwarding the coordinates.
get me the president.
you said they sent the tac team ten minutes ago.
miles set me up, and you helped.
you're working against us, chloe.
you have no idea what you've done.
miles said that... - miles is an idiot.
if anyone should know that, it should be you.
I can't believe you went along with him.
please come with us, ms. O'brian.
where are we going?- Let's go.
Mr. President, I need to remind you that we still don't have confirmation that audrey raines and bauer are at the location.
you'll find out soon enough.
I'll have the military authority follow up on it.
the military? Sir, I just dispatched my tac team.
call them back.
I don't understand...
Jack bauer is a very sensitive problem.
there are political ramifications.
I've decided to handle him directly.
and besides, you must have your hands full, transitioning ctu to homeland security.
I'll recall my team, sir.
good.
now the president wants oversight on the bauer operation.
he's the president. He can do what he wants.
Yeah.
CTU thinks they found bauer.
where?
Jack, what if my father's right?
what if he can get logan to step down quietly?
maybe that is the best thing for this country.
these people brokered chemical weapons to terrorists.
they've killed an ex-president of the united states.
Logan's not going to make a deal with your father, and even if he did, he wouldn't keep it.
Henderson wouldn't let him.
the only thing your father's doing right now is making himself a target.
you want to help him?
help me get the recording back before he speaks to logan.
look, mike, this isn't me being territorial, but if the president wants jack bauer, why doesn't he let us take care of it?
now, look, I've been on other things.
let me find out what's going on.
I'll get back to you, karen.
thank you, mike.
...will be lifted within the next two hours, but the curfew will remain in effect...
come in.
that's only six hours from now.
okay.
david palmer's body's being flown back to dc at 7: 00 A. M.
the president and I both want to be there when the coffin's put onto the plane.
that's a good idea. - Yeah.
what's up, mike?
I just got a call from karen hayes at ctu.
do you know about the president's decision to pull them off the acquisition of jack bauer?
no, but what's the problem?
the problem is it doesn't really make sense.
Karen's teams are closer. They can do it more efficiently.
Bauer's more likely to cooperate with them than with a group of military police he doesn't know.
well, karen and her team have barely gotten ctu back on its feet.
I'm sure the president just feels more confident with the military units already in place because of martial law.
well, the military has its hands full, hal.
what do you want me to say, mike?
it's the president's call.
I can see it both ways.
yeah?
operations.
Beth, it's mike novick. Put me through to general warren, please.
Yes, sir.
this is warren.
sir, I have mike novick on the line for you.
go ahead, beth.
he's on.
what is it, mike?
general, can you give me an update on your search for jack bauer?
what are you talking about?
the one the president ordered.
we never received such a call from the president.
I see.
I-I'm sorry to disturb you, general.
you should try to get some rest, mr. President.
Yes, I know. I should try to get some rest.
what is it you want, mike?
I just got off the phone with general warren, who's running military operations here in los angeles.
why would you be talking with him?
Karen hayes over at homeland raised a few good points I thought I'd follow up on.
what good points, mike?
she doesn't understand why she was taken out of the loop on this jack bauer situation.
you know, I really don't care what karen hayes understands.
she should be doing her job and not bothering my advisors, asking questions that diminish my authority.
be that as it may, I did follow up, and, now, frankly,
I'm a little mystified by some things.
what things mystify you, mike?
well, you told homeland that you wanted the military to pick up jack bauer, but I just spoke with general warren, and he's unaware of any such directive.
because I didn't go through general warren.
may I ask who you did go through?
Mike, let's get one thing straight:
I don't answer to you.
of course not, sir.
however, I will tell you this:
I-I have decided to use a covert task force to bring in jack bauer.
the reason I'm doing that is because bauer presents...
special circumstances.
special circumstances?
I want this completely off the radar, mike.
the chinese government may still believe that jack bauer is dead.
if they find out that he's alive, they're going to blame us.
they're going to, uh, accuse us of fabricating the story of his death.
wouldn't we be keeping the circle smaller if we let karen handle this?
her people already know about bauer.
they're working under a secretive mandate.
you know what, mike? I am tired of being second-guessed.
I've been dealing with-with-with... wall-to-wall crises for the last 18 hours, and I think I've done a pretty damn good job of leading the country.
of course, mr. President.
you came in here suggesting that I should get some rest.
that's the one recommendation of yours that I intend to take.
thank you, mike.
we traced your call to a public phone at van nuys airport.
if audrey raines is at that location, you're in a lot of trouble.
miles, this situation is more complicated than you think.
you have no idea what you're dealing with. --But you do.
Yes. -Then why didn't you tell me?
because I can'T.
you think the rules don't apply to you because you're smarter than the rest of us, but I have news for you. They do, and you're not.
I won't miss you when you're gone.
don't touch me.
what?
Jack bauer did not kill president palmer.
he's a federal fugitive wanted for the murder of a former president, which means you're going to jail, o'brian.
for a long time.
I don't think you're as big of a jerk as you pretend to be.
I need to speak to you. - Yes, sir.
what are you doing, chloe?
you're supposed to be in custody.
miles let me out.
you're a worse liar than I am.
shari, don't do that.
you helped audrey raines break surveillance.
Yes, I did it for a good reason. I can't get into it right now.
well, I don't really think you have a choice.
listen to me for a minute.
Jack bauer did not kill president palmer. He knows who did it.
he may need my help to prove it and I can't help him if I'm in custody.
then why don't you just tell karen?
because she won't believe me. Nobody will, not without evidence.
it's president logan.
what are you talking about?
the evidence jack is trying to get implicates logan in the assassination of palmer.
that's ridiculous, chloe.
you know your sexual harassment charges against miles? I know you were lying.
you're sick and you need help, and if you try to stop me and it turns out I'm right about jack, and I am,
I will recommend you for a psychiatric evaluation.
and you won't like that, trust me.
Charles. You coming to bed soon?
I doubt if I'll get much sleep tonight.
you should try.
you okay? - I'm fine.
it's just, uh...it's been a challenging day.
okay.
come to bed.
I will. Soon.
yes?
I'm sorry to disturb you, mr. President, but secretary heller is on the line.
he insists on talking to you.
tell him I'll call him back tomorrow.
he says it's urgent, sir.
put him through.
Yes, james.
thanks for taking my call, mr. President.
you said it was urgent.
I need to see you, sir.
see me about what?
I'd rather speak to you in person.
fine, but I won't be back to washington for a couple of days.
I'm in L. A.Sir.
I need to see you tonight.
tonight? What is this about?
I'll be there shortly and we can discuss it then.
I don't like your tone, james.
in case you've forgotten, you're addressing the president of the united states.
I know who I'm addressing.
and I think you know exactly what this is about.
when will you be here?
five minutes. -Fine.
James heller? What does he want?
he's getting flak from the joint chiefs about my decision to maintain martial law.
you would think that these people would show some allegiance.
can't james handle it himself?
apparently not.
come to bed when you're done. -I will.
where are you?
we're leaving now.
how long will it take you to get there? -Ten minutes.
we may not have that much time.
James heller is on his way here. He insisted on seeing me right away.
Jack got to him.
what if bauer's given him the recording?
Heller's not stupid enough to carry it with him, and without it, whatever he knows or whatever he thinks he knows won't matter.
you think bauer still has it?
I'm sure of it.
I'll hold heller off as long as I can, --but you phone me the second you have the evidence in hand. --Right.
Mrs. Logan.
what is secretary heller doing here?
I don't know, ma'am.
but you have an idea.
my husband says it's about his order to maintain martial law, but I think it's something else.
if you know what it is, will you please tell me?
I can'T.
you can't? Or you won't?
please don't ask me anything more, mrs. Logan.
whatever you tell me will remain between the two of us. I promise you.
Aaron...you can trust me. You know that.
not here.
meet me in a couple minutes. -Where?
outside the south stable.
thank you, gentlemen.
I hope this was important.
I know what you did. I know what you're doing.
and I'm here to put an end to it.
you have to be a little more specific.
you are responsible for the murder of david palmer.
that's outrageous.
I heard a recording
a conversation between you and man named christopher henderson.
when palmer found out about your insane plan, henderson had him killed.
and you let it happen.
where is this recording?
it's in a safe place.
I would like to hear it.
Why? You know exactly what you said, and so do I.
it's burnt into my memory.
how dare you stand there and judge me?
you have no idea.
until you sit in my chair, you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
your chair is not a throne, charles.
I'm protecting the interests of our country. --You mean oil.
Yes. Yes! This country needs energy more than you or anybody in this gridlocked government cares to admit.
we'll see how you judge me when the cost of oil goes up over $100 a barrel and the people who put me in office can't afford to heat their homes or run their cars.
and you think that justifies the blood on your hands?
what do you want?
I want you to drop the trumped-up charges against jack bauer.
and leave my daughter alone.
anything else?
announce your resignation by tomorrow morning.
blame it on the crushing stress of today's events, or blame it on whatever you want, just as long as you go public by the start of the morning news cycle.
and then what?
the recording will be kept under lock and key, and this will remain between us.
call in vice president gardner.
I want to be here when you hand him your letter of resignation.
get in here.
I haven't been able to contact jack or audrey. --I haven't talked to them either.
CTU might have them in custody.
I need to tap into their current protocols.
Where's your workstation? -This way.
homeland changed my access code.
I can create a workaround.
if ctu has jack, it's all my fault.
I can get us out of here.
watch the door.
he's got restraints in his pocket. Secure him.
Wexler, status report.
mark, come in.
don't move.
don't... move. Slowly put the gun on the ground and kick it towards me.
do it!
put your hands where I can see them.
give me the recording. Slowly.
stand up.
what did you do to my partner?
he's fine.
son of a bitch!
take cover behind the wheel! Now! Move! Move!
what the hell's going on?!
they've come for the recording!
if you and I are gonna get through this alive, we need to work together.
give me my gun!
I have her, jack. Now don't make me kill her.
there's been too much killing today already, so just throw out that recording.
let her go, christopher.
after I have the recording.
why are you doing this? Why are you protecting logan?
I'm protecting something much more important than charles logan.
what?
the integrity of our government.
our government has no integrity.
not when someone like charles logan occupies the presidency.
Christopher, you can make this right. You can help me stop him.
sorry, jack. Now throw me the recording.
I'll give you the recording if you let audrey go.
I wish I could believe that.
I give you my word.
I'll tell you what.
I'll meet you halfway.
what does that mean?
damn it, christopher!
here she comes, jack. Walk out slow, or I'll kill you.
that's far enough, ms. Raines.
what have you done to her?
the left brachial artery.
she has about three minutes before she bleeds to death. Now throw me that recording.
Jack, don'T.
she's 15 seconds closer to dying, jack. Give me the recording.
Jack, don't do it.
she's running out of time.
don't do it, jack. Don'T. Don't give it to him.
here it is!
easy, easy, easy. Easy. Stay with me. Stay with me.
Jack, go get him. Go get him. Go.
stay with me.
I'll be right back.
give me your arm.
I need to move you. Come on.
all it needs is your signature, mr. President.
James, we can find another way to handle this.
there must be something I can give you, something that you want.
you're giving me exactly what I want.
you asked to see me, mr. President?
Hi, jim.
I thought you'd be on a plane back to washington.
what are you doing here?
I'll let president logan tell you.
Mr. President.
Yes.
I have the recording.
Really?
I'll call you back after I've secured a vehicle.
thank you.
I'm asking secretary heller to tender his resignation. I wanted you here as a witness.
What?!
he came here to accuse me of being complicit in today's terrorist attacks.
I don't know how he can make such an accusation without any evidence.
he orchestrated a conspiracy to let terrorists acquire stolen nerve gas.
that's insane, james.
he sanctioned the assassination of david palmer! And I have the evidence.
where? Show it to us.
who was on the phone? Who made that call?
I want your resignation on my desk by the morning.
if any harm comes to my daughter...gentlemen!
please escort secretary heller out of my home.
I need Karen Hayes to go away.
I understand, sir.
I need the president to sign off on my proposals.
she's gone from being an irritant to an obstacle.
I want to talk about your husband's incompetence, and your covering it up.
I did nothing illegal or incorrect.
your resignation within the hour.
Mr. President, I am tendering my resignation.
is there anything I can do to change your mind?
no, sir, there is not.
walid has earned their trust.
these men know something about the bombs that we don'T.
I don't think these guys you're tracking are connected to anyone.
they're not terrorists.
I'm getting Walid the hell out of there.
you spied on us?
you're worse than they are!
son of a bitch!
a nuclear bomb just went off, like, 25 miles from here.
when I'm done with this deal,
I may just buy you a small country.
have you found an engineer?
I told you I'd find someone and I will.
it's just taking longer.
start talking, Gray!
I made a mess.
dad's trying to clean it up.
what happened?
I hired Mccarthy to oversee the job, but...
so the nukes that these terrorist are in possession of, including the one that was just detonated in Valencia, was supplied by Mccarthy and stolen from you.
Yes.
I'm heading to Mccarthy's office in Simi valley.
we have teams standing by.
let me know.
stop.
he's my son.
what are you doing here, jack?
Jack: I know what you're trying to cover up, dad.
gray already told me.
McCarthy's not here.
Hey, what are you doing?
put the gun down!
you work for me.
no, dad, he doesn'T.
you don't think I'd let you run loose without keeping an eye on you, do you?
this is insane.
I am at the edge of the safe zone.
behind me is the nuclear blast.
emergency medical teams are being overwhelmed by the number of injured.
in what president Palmer has confirmed was a tactical nuclear weapon detonated just a little over two hours ago in this Valencia neighborhood north of Los Angeles, more than 12, 000 people are estimated to have perished in the blast.
LAPD is spread thin, but on an encouraging note, we've heard that they are receiving a flood...
I just heard about Karen's resignation.
I'm sorry for the loss.
are you really sorry, Tom?
because your words seemed somewhat hollow to me.
it's no secret Karen and I butted heads the last few weeks.
nevertheless, I respected her as an adversary.
she never gave me a concrete reason why she resigned, but there was something...
something she wasn't telling me.
this may have something to do with it.
this is a draft of the executive order I presented this morning.
Karen found out I was going to resubmit it to you for your authorization.
and so she quit?
that makes absolutely no sense to me, Tom.
she's never been afraid of a fight.
maybe she finally realized her arguments are invalid and that this is the only possible response to the danger we're facing.
you want to tell me why I would sign off on something that I rejected six hours ago?
because, sir, six hours ago, we didn't know Fayed had nukes.
even so, Tom, you're talking about suspending habeas corpus, extending the length and broadening the criteria for those detention centers.
those actions will constitute a brazen abuse of executive power.
those actions will degrade Fayed's network, limiting his ability to make use of these remaining nuclear weapons.
sir, Fayed's sole intention here is the destruction of our country, its infrastructure, social order, entire way of life, and he's got the will and means to make good on that threat.
Tom, have you stopped to think about the fact I would be forcing the people who elected me to give up the rights and freedoms that define the essence of this country?
sir, if one more nuke goes off, it would have been Fayed who's redefined our country.
pass this out to the cabinet.
we'll convene in 30 minutes.
you're doing the right thing, Mr. President.
call the cabinet in for an emergency session.
tell general White we're ramping up.
does that mean the president is signing off on this?
he wouldn't convene the cabinet unless he was.
good work, Reed.
well, I'm just doing what needs to be done, sir.
getting rid of Karen is distinctly unpleasant, but she left us no choice.
girl, I'm sorry I'm late with the briefing.
tell the president we're still tracking Fayed through Mccarthy.
bill, I've just had to resign.
resign? What are you talking about?
can't get into it right now, but I've asked to be reassigned to cut as an on-site liaison.
Karen, you can't leave the president today, of all days.
bill, do you think that I would do this if I had any other choice?
Lennox has something to do with this, doesn't he?
I cannot talk about this right now.
I will see you in a few hours. Okay?
Mr. Buchanan.
what is it, Chloe?
I've been trying to reach Jack on his cell phone;
he's not answering.
try his backup teams.
I tried; they're not answering either.
maybe he had them all go dark.
he wouldn't do that without telling us first.
send in the support units, see if they can get a visual.
all right.
and keep trying Jack.
so after we're done, where do you want us to meet you?
I'll be here another hour dumping hard drives.
we'll meet you back at the house, then.
just make sure it goes exactly according to plan.
don't worry.
it's my job to worry.
it was all for you, Jack.
everything I worked for, everything I built
it was all for you.
after you left, I tried to convince myself that Graem was capable of heading the family...
protecting the company
I guess, on some level, I always knew the truth about him.
I just wasn't willing to admit it to myself.
I don't know what you want me to say.
I want you to understand that after you left, Graem was all I had.
I pushed you away, didn't I?
I'm really sorry.
get out.
come on.
don't do this, sir.
whatever Graem's paying you, I'll double it.
just keep it moving.
get down on your knees, both of you.
no.
you son of a bitch.
at least have the guts to look me in the eye.
I needed to question him.
they were gonna kill us, Jack.
search his pockets for the keys.
damn it!
bill, it's Jack.
Jack, we haven't been able to reach you.
are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine, but all the members of the backup team have been killed.
have you found Mccarthy?
not yet, but I know how to get to hiM.
how?
my brother.
you said your brother wasn't involved when Mccarthy brokered the nukes.
he lied to mE.
he didn't tell us everything.
based on what?
he just tried to have me and my father killed.
bill, I need you to set up a perimeter around his house.
I'll send a field team right away.
have them do an immediate recon, confirm that he's there.
I want Burke standing by with an interrogation kit.
what?
as it stands now, Mccarthy is our only lead to Fayed.
we need to find Fayed before he arms the nukes.
I'll get back to you as soon as I make contact with the field team.
we need to go.
where do you think you're going?
I'm hungry.
there's a candy machine in the lobby.
don't worry. We'll be leaving soon.
you said that an our ago.
sit down, Rita.
yes?
good news.
I found someone to program the trigger codes for your bombs.
who?
I've just you sent his profile, employment record, education, the whole curriculum vitae.
you should have it on your screen.
I'm looking at it now.
he seems qualified.
Oh, he'll get the job done, but he won't work willingly.
he'll need to be coerced.
okay, when will you have him?
within the hour.
call me when you do.
Mr. Buchanan, you need to listen to this.
what?
NSA intercepted a stream of chatter
part of it's an audio recording.
they've identified one of the voices as belonging to Fayed.
let's hear it.
good news.
I found someone to program the trigger codes on your bombs.
who?
I've just sent you his profile, employment record, education, the whole curriculum vitae.
it should be on your screen.
I'm looking at it now.
he seems qualified.
he'll get the job done, but he won't work willingly.
he'll need to be coerced.
okay, when will you have him?
within the hour.
call me when you do.
second voice matches the sample we pulled off Mccarthy's voice-mail.
they lost Numair in the explosion, so Mccarthy found someone else to arm the nukes.
send the file to audio forensics.
have them scan for any background artifacts that could give us a location.
Yes, sir.
I had Morris working on something, too.
we also found an image file inside the data stream.
NSA thinks it might be a photo of the engineer.
is this it?
Yeah, it got all corrupted during the intercept.
I'm writing a salvage utility.
I should have a new code in a second.
getting an image of the engineer may be our only way of stopping those nukes.
give me an estimate.
well, that's hard to say.
could be ten minutes, it could be an hour.
who's the agent in charge?
my name is Jack Bauer.
Mr. Bauer, I'm Hal Turner.
I'll be on point.
are your men in position?
Yes, sir.
we've sealed off a one-block radius, and our recon has confirmed your brother's inside
his wife and son are in there as well.
I want you to inform your team to use nonlethal force.
we need to take my brother alive.
understood.
let me go in with you.
no.
you wait here.
I need to question Graem alone.
what are you gonna do to him?
whatever it takes to find out what he knows.
I'm not stupid, Graem
I know something is wrong.
everything's fine, Marilyn.
you're a lousy liar.
you always have been.
you know, if you insist on being here, why don't you make some coffee?
why don't you make your own coffee!
will you two stop fighting?
that's all you guys ever do is fight.
I'm sorry, honey.
we're just all a little tense today.
what's going on?
nothing.
nothing. Why don't, why don't we leave your father alone.
he needs to work.
put the weapon down!
drop the gun!
what the hell is this, Jack?!
put it down!
do it.
get on the floor!
take it easy, Jack!
I want you take him into the next room, have Burke prep him for questioning.
I want every hard drive, every memory stick in this house uploaded and sent over to CTU.
pick him up.
go. Go.
what are you doing to my dad?
Josh, I'll explain as soon as I can, but right now I need to speak to your mother.
please, just take a seat.
please, son, come on.
let's go.
let go of me!
stop looking at me like this has something to do with us, because it doesn'T.
Graem just tried to have me and our father killed.
Why?
why would he try and kill you?
they nuclear bomb that was detonated earlier today
the terrorists acquired it from the family's company!
gray's been trying to cover it up.
I'm sorry, Marilyn.
I understand how difficult this must be for you to believe.
it's not.
I may not know the details of what he's done, but I know what he's capable of.
there are four more other bombs out there.
we need to get them back
is there anything that you can tell me?
like what?
did gray talk about a man named Mccarthy?
no.
are you sure?
he hasn't confided in me in years.
he probably never did.
Marilyn, thousands of lives are at stake.
please, just think.
I wish I knew something, I really wish I did, but I don't know anything.
and Josh doesn't know anything, either, and he doesn't need to know.
I'll do everything I can to protect him.
No!
I've seen what happens when you try and protect people.
I just want to get my son, and I want to get out of here!
sir, we found two computers, both linked to one network.
he was trying to erase files
we're sending what's left over to CTU.
okay, good.
my sister-in-law and my nephew don't need to stay here.
have them transported back to CTU.
they can be debriefed there.
Yes, sir.
Mrs. Bauer.
we're taking you and your son back to CTU.
grandpa.
you okay?
not really.
wait in the car, baby.
Jack told me what Graem did, what he was involved with.
is it true?
it's complicated.
but it's true.
you make sure he keeps Josh out of this.
I panicked, Jack.
that's all there is to it.
you panicked?
that's your excuse?
you panicked?!
you tried to kill me and our father.
I was backed into a corner.
I was just protecting my ass.
you knew about a tactical nuclear weapon on American soil.
you are responsible for the death of thousands and thousands of people.
you think I really wanted that bomb to go off, Jack?
I think you knew more about Mccarthy than you told me.
how do I find him?
I don't have a clue.
how do I find him?!
I just told you I don't know.
there are four more bombs out there.
this isn't a joke, Gray.
tell me now, how do I find Mccarthy?
I told you everything I know, Jack.
respiration and temperature patterns indicate deception, especially his last reply.
set up the interrogation package.
you don't want to make me do this, Gray.
we grew up together, Jack.
in all those years, I could never make you do anything you didn't want to do.
I need to talk to you.
what is it?
over here.
it's Morris's brother.
he's on his way to horizon regional hospital.
on-site paramedics confirmed he has severe radiation exposure.
it says he's in critical condition.
I'll tell him.
wait, Chloe.
I think we should hold off.
Why?
Morris is the best hope we have for restoring that file.
if we drop this on him now, he might completely shut down.
it's his brother-- we can't keep it a secret.
I understand.
this might sound insensitive, but for a second, put aside your personal feelings for Morris and consider what's at stake.
we need him to finish writing that salvage utility.
I know Morris; he can handle it.
I hope so.
Yes, darling?
I have some bad news.
it's about Timothy
he's been taken to the hospital.
I'm sorry.
well, this can't be right
it says he was pulled...
from his car by rescue workers just north of Valencia.
operator.
Yes, could you connect me with horizon regional hospital, please?
what was he doing in Valencia?
I'm sorry, sir, all circuits are busy.
Yes, I realize that the lines are busy
this is CTU, Los Angeles, calling
I need an emergency breakthrough.
I cannot help you at this time, sir. - I know...
sorry.
I-I have to go out there.
Morris, hey,
I know it's hard, okay?
but we are in the middle of a crisis.
we need to find the engineer before Fayed does.
you can't just leave.
you can't expect me to sit there when my little brother is dying in the hospital.
I'm sorry, Milo.
listen.
12, 000 people are dead.
if Fayed finds an engineer, it'll be many, many more.
four bombs is about a million people.
think about this.
you can finish writing the program
you can do it.
Yes, I can-- but you started already.
it will take me half an hour to figure out what you've done.
you need to stay here and do your job.
please.
okay.
Thanks.
bill, it's Jack.
did Chloe pull anything off the hard drives?
no, she came up empty.
but 15 minutes ago, the NSA picked up a conversation between Mccarthy and Fayed.
McCarthy's found another engineer to arm the four remaining nukes.
he's delivering the engineer within the hour.
the nukes could be operational within 45 minutes?
that's right.
I'll get back to you.
CTU just confirmed that Mccarthy is looking for an engineer for Fayed.
they're gonna arm the nukes.
then you're wasting time talking to me, Jack.
you're holding something back.
that machine doesn't lie.
then it must be broken because I've told you everything I know.
that's hyocine-pentothal.
it's a neuro-inflamatory, designed to induce pain.
all you have to do to stop me from using it is tell me how to find Mccarthy.
your guess is as good as mine.
come on, come on.
I can take this to seven cc'S.
you will experience pain I can't even describe.
at eight cc's, I run the risk of inducing a heart attack.
make no mistake about it, I will go there if I have to.
please, just tell me what I need to know.
please.
I don't want to hurt you.
you sure about that, Jack?
please, Gray, just tell me what I need to know.
how do I find Mccarthy?!
do it.
breathe.
just breathe.
just breathe.
please...
just tell me what I need to know.
how do I find Mccarthy?!
damn you.
that's eight cc's total, Jack.
his vitals are spiking across the line.
four cc's!
Jack, don'T.
the machine knows you're lying!
I know you're lying!
tell me the truth!
it has nothing to do with Mccarthy.
it has to do with Palmer.
I gave the order for his assassination.
and agent Tony Almeida...
and agent Michelle Dessler
your co-workers
they're all dead because of me.
I arranged everything.
I set the timetable,
I paid off the killers,
I even lured you out of hiding to take the fall.
today wasn't the first time I tried to have you killed, Jack.
Why?
because I love my country!
and in the real world, sometimes that means you have to do things, terrible things...
even unforgivable things, for the sake of your country.
but you know all about that, don't you, brother?
we're the same.
I mean, look at me.
we're the same!
we are not the same!
you want me to kill you?!
do it!
I'm gonna do it my way!
four more cc'S.
I can't do that.
pick up the syringe!
do it!
now!
son of a bitch!
-Get me somebody in here now.
you want to die?
drop your weapon!
drop it!
you're gonna die.
shut down the iv.
shut it down.
I'm here, baby.
I'm ashamed.
what do you mean you're ashamed?
for spying on those men.
I thought I was doing the right thing.
I was wrong.
you did the only thing that you could do...
okay, and that was the right thing.
you're the bravest, most principled man I've ever known.
you get some rest, okay?
Hello?
it's Wayne.
I just heard what happened to Walid.
I am so sorry.
is he going to be all right?
Yeah, I think so.
what they told me is confusing.
they said Walid was working undercover to expose some plot.
there was no plot.
the men weren't part of any conspiracy.
they were just bystanders.
they tell me these men had information about the nuclear weapons.
one of the men pulled it from the internet and showed it to his friends.
Sandra, they should've reported that.
they were afraid they were going to get into more trouble than they're already in.
most of these men were pulled from their jobs and their homes on trumped-up immigration charges.
and now they're facing deportation.
Wayne, you are detaining without due process the people whose help you need the most.
how do you expect for them to help if they don't have any legal protection?
I'm scared.
I know.
everything's gonna be all right.
what's the status?
program's finished.
I just ran it, but this is all we got.
I still don't have a clear image.
what are you doing?
I'm downloading an unlicensed application from a hacker's site.
it might kick-start things.
or it could corrupt the file.
I know these guys.
they write really good code when they're not serving time.
unbelievable.
that's what Graem was holding back?
not only was he responsible for David Palmer's assassination, but he directed the entire conspiracy.
he was trying to protect the company.
that's what he's trying to do now.
incredible.
I wish it got us closer to the nukes, but it doesn'T.
he doesn't know where Mccarthy is.
were you able to pick up anything on NSA chatter?
we think it may contain an image of Mccarthy's engineer.
how long till you know for sure?
can't say. The file's badly corrupted.
Morris is working on it now.
as soon as my brother's ready for transport,
I want him sent back to CTU for further debriefing.
I've redirected a chopper to Jackson middle school, four miles west of your position.
Thanks, Bill.
dad, Graem made his own choices after you let him start running the company.
you can't make yourself responsible for that.
that's not fair.
I'll tell you what isn't fair.
you deserved a better family, Jack.
not this.
not us.
I can just imagine what you must be feeling.
all that time we lost...
what I wouldn't give to have some of it back.
me, too.
agent Bauer.
Yeah.
your brother's been stabilized.
he'll be ready to move in ten minutes.
thank you.
dad, I want you to go back to CTU.
okay.
I need a few minutes.
of coursE.
they're sending a chopper for me.
I have to go.
there.
what?
the plug-in's working.
how long's it going to take?
it's restoring.
you'll have a photo of the engineer in two minutes.
just don't touch anything.
now I have got to go and find out what's happening with my brother.
save it, Milo.
thanks for trying to help.
I'm leaving.
watch my station, okay?
be careful.
call me when you find anything out about Timothy.
I will.
congratulations, Tom.
it's an excellent plan.
well, thank you very much, Mr. Vice president.
it's about time someone in this administration stood up to these people.
to be honest,
I didn't think this president had the stomach for the cure.
I think we're about ready for kickoff here, sir.
I'm going to put you on speakerphone.
is the vice president with us?
I'm on the plane, sir.
I'm assuming everyone here has read executive order 1066?
Tom first proposed his plan to me very early this morning, and I rejected it.
sacrificing the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the constitution seemed like, like too steep a price, even for the promise of securitY.
but then Fayed murdered 12, 000 innocent Americans with a nuclear weapon.
I felt compelled to revisit my earlier position.
after careful reconsideration,
I remain convinced that my initial response was in fact the right one.
that implementing this plan
would be a terrible mistake.
I cannot and I will not endorse these actions.
some of you actually seem to feel that the constitution is somehow valid only during times of peace, but not during wartime.
that is not what the founders intended.
with your indulgence, sir, George Washington's enemies wore bright red coats and marched in a straight line.
the founders could have never conceived of a stateless enemy, hiding among us, that targets not our soldiers, but our civilization.
your plan would only hinder the efforts of law enforcement to stop Fayed.
how does my plan hinder law enforcement, sir?
by marginalizing and thereby radicalizing the very people whose help they need to enlist.
the American muslim community is our best line of defense against these terrorists.
but we Americans need to demonstrate that we are governed by the rule of law and never, never by the politics of fear.
Mr. President.
Yes, Noah?
before you make any unilateral decisions, maybe you should hear some other people's thoughts.
I'm sorry, Noah.
the discussion on this matter...
is over.
this better work.
Jack's on his way back to CTU.
I want holding "a" and "b" prepped for interrogation and put together a clearance package for him, no restrictions.
Yes, sir.
we have it yet?
it's gonna be a few more seconds.
as soon as we I.D.The engineer,
I want it posted on the interagency subnet.
we need all eyes possible on this.
Yes, sir.
Oh, my god!
it's Morris!
it's his CV, personal history, everything.
where is he?
on his way to horizon regional hospital.
we got to call that.
his brother was hurt in the blast.
he just left.
security.
this is Bill Bhanan.
has Morris O'brian left the parking lot?
he just drove out, sir.
damn it!
Milo, contact lapd.
put an apb out on his car.
Chloe, see if you can raise him on his cell phone.
Jack, we just id'ed the engineer.
it's Morris O'brian.
Yes.
the file we intercepted was Morris's photo and CV.
McCarthy was sending it to Fayed.
there is no doubt Morris is the engineer.
fine. Put him under a protective watch.
we can'T.
he's gone.
he got a call claiming his brother was in the hospital.
he just left.
we're trying to raise him on his cell.
Morris, hold on.
he's on line one.
we got him, Jack.
patch me through.
Morris, it's Bill Buchanan.
we're on the line with Jack Bauer.
where are you?
I'm on my way to the hospital.
you need to come back to CTU immediately.
I can't do that.
Morris, this is Jack.
listen to me.
there is nothing wrong with your brother.
it's a setup.
the engineer Mccarthy's looking for, it's you.
me?
it was your photo Mccarthy was sending to Fayed.
Morris, you need to turn the car around now.
okay, okay.
get out of the car or the next one's in your head!
what the bloody hell do you want?
don't talk, move!
come on. Let's go.
Jack, they got him!
it sounds like they're transferring him to another vehicle.
Chloe, bring up a satellite feed five-mile radius of CTU.
hurry.
drive.
yes?
we're on our way.
how soon can you be here?
15 minutes.
we'll be waiting.
with my money.
you'll get paid as soon as I have what I want.
let me be clear.
I'm just delivering him.
you'll have to make him cooperate.
he'll cooperate.
agent Burke,
I'd like to speak to my son.
all right.
five minutes.
Thanks.
how am I doing?
you're doing great.
everyone thinks Jack is so tough.
maybe he is...
but so am I.
it's nice to know that I can take anything he can dish out.
you told him about Palmer.
I had to give him something to make him think I cracked, but I kept you out of it.
it's gonna get a lot worse.
he's not finished.
he knows you didn't tell him everything.
and I won'T. You know I won't, dad.
they're going to take you to CTU.
they'll do things there that'll make this seem like a cakewalk.
well, like I said,
I can take it.
I'd like to believe that.
the problem is, I have to be sure.
well, you can be.
I'll hold my mud, dad.
everything's going exactly according to plan.
Jack bought the ruse.
Oh, I know.
I'm sure we convinced him that you were going to have me killed as well.
Yeah, that makes me the bad guy and you the good guy.
I take the rap, do some time, you skate free.
get me out when you can.
meanwhile, the company lives on.
dad, stick to the plan.
that's what you've always said, right?
make a plan.
stick to it.
sometimes you have to make adjustments.
I would never betray you, dad.
I love you.
I love you, too, Graem.
you've been a good boy.
done everything I asked.
only this time, I asked too much.
sorry.
dad...
my son's had a seizure!
get in here now!
hurry up!
what happened?
is he going to make it?
I don't know. Please, give us the room so we can work.
get CTU medical now!
my god, if you people killed my son, I swear...
you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
the americans know our location.
we need to launch the drone before they close in.
we'll find a way to deliver the other two bombs.
Gredenko: Launch the drone.
I can't find the drone.
readjust based on projected vectors.
I'm doing that now, general. It's just not where it's supposed to be!
Walsh: Until you find it, I'll have my f-16s stay in a holding pattern.
we figured out how the drone was able to stay hidden from our satellites.
whoever is piloting it is able to anticipate our repositioning directives.
how can he do that?
our satellite data is being relayed to the drone pilot through a workstation here.
we have a leak.
we have to find out who's subverting our system.
it is nadia. The signature trace matches her computer.
surrender your station.
who are you streaming our satellite data to?
What?!
I will do what's necessary to get the answers I need.
let her go.
what the hell are you doing?
we got the drone pilot's location.
we're not through with her, milo.
Jack, what's your status?
the drone pilot is down. I'm at his controls now.
the target is san francisco.
there is no way to deactivate the bomb remotely.
I'm fighting a stall. I'm losing control of the drone.
I need to find a place to land it now.
none of the first responders in san francisco are reporting a detonation.
the bomb did not go off on impact.
move out!
there's radioactive material in this area!
we were able to take control of the aircraft, crash-landing it in an industrial park at the edge of the city.
but in the process, the bomb's nuclear core was compromised and radioactive material was released.
so what we're essentially dealing with is a dirty bomb.
sir, it was a radiological spilL.
it was an attack on our nation.
I warned the ambassador, tom.
we were led to believe that this warning shot would be fired only in response to the detonation of a nuclear device.
they need to see with their own eyes that I will answer this threat with an in-kind military response.
the order's given.
launch the missile as soon as they're in range.
the following takes place between 8pm and 9pm.
prep two units of fresh plasma.
you need to keep him alive. Gredenko's got two more bombs out there.
right now this man's our only link to them.
Jack! I just talked to ctu.
there's a situation developing where the drone went down.
what? - The casing on the nuclear bomb, it cracked.
there's been some dispersal into the atmosphere.
how bad is the fallout?
a dozen first-responders were exposed to high levels, but casualties should be minimal.
wind vectors are okay so far, and they're starting to evacuate.
okay. I want you to go through the pilot's databases and electronic files.
I want you to see if you can find any link to gredenko.
agent bauer.
he didn't make it.
damn it.
Buchanan. - Bill, it's jack.
what did you get from the drone pilot?
no, he's dead.
we've been running down leads on this end.
so far nothing's come up on gredenko.
Doyle told me about the fallout, but he said it was containable?
I'm afraid it's not that simple.
the incident has created some serious policy complications in washington.
like what?
vice president daniels has ordered a nuclear strike against fayed's country.
what's he trying to do, start world war iii?
that'll be seen as an act of aggression against the entire middle east.
which is why we have to find fayed and gredenko before daniels launches the strike.
when is it happening? - Within the hour.
bill, that doesn't give us enough time to find gredenko.
I'll get back to you.
Victor's still not answering.
because the americans found him.
the bomb was supposed to hit san francisco ten minutes ago, but there is nothing on the news.
even if you're right, we are safe here.
Victor doesn't know our location.
so we can continue our operations safely.
what operation?
there is no operation.
it's over because of you and your people.
no, fayed, it isn't over.
we have two more bombs.
I have the bombs.
but you need me to deliver them.
I'm the only one who can give you the targets you want.
come on, come on, shoot me now, or put down the gun.
Yeah. - Mark hauser?
who's this? - You know who it is.
I already gave you what you asked for.
but your employer has tightened security, so the access I paid for is no good.
that's not my problem.
it is your problem.
it became your problem the moment you took my money.
it'll take some time to download the new security protocols.
how much time?
half an hour, maybe longer. I can call you when it's ready.
I'll be there in 40 minutes. - Gredenko.
I'm hungry.
knock yourself out.
there's peppers in herE.
you like peppers. - Not red ones. I don't eat red food, mark.
since when?
I don't like red food.
I'll take the peppers out, okay?
you-you take care of me, mark.
you-you always...take care of me.
I do my best, brady.
while I'm doing this, I need you to do something for me.
okay.
I need you to access some files from the mainframe at my office.
can you do that? - Yeah.
let's go.
Nadia's being processed as an enemy combatant.
she's being transferred to a holding station in temecula.
sir, i don't know if I can accept that she betrayed us, that she spied for fayed.
I think we're wrong.
this is not easy for any of us.
but the facts at hand indicate she was streaming intel from her station.
Mr. Buchanan. - What is it?
we may have caught a break.
what do you have?
I've been monitoring everyone on our watch list who's ever communicated with gredenko through phone calls or e-mails.
the filter algorithm flagged a call that happened a few minutes ago.
mark hauser. He does security consulting for energy companies.
his company has contracts with dozens of chemical facilities
oil fields, pipelines and nuclear power plants.
unfortunately the call was scrambled, but we do have hauser's address.
get that address to jack.
you wanted to see me? - Yeah, excuse us, guys.
while I was stripping data from the drone pilot's hard drive, I found this.
what is it?
remote access module.
it's how the drone pilot breached ctu's satellite grid.
no, the pilot got into our system because nadia yassir opened the door and let him in.
no, she didn'T.
this guy got in through one of the radical web sites nadia's been monitoring.
the access module proves it.
are you saying nadia's system was compromised and she didn't know it?
that's right.
that puts you in a tough position, considering you're the one who led the witch hunt against her.
I followed standard protocols based on the information that was available at the time.
well, nadia might not see it that way when she takes it up with the justice department.
you know, once the dust settles today, they might want to make you an example.
relax, mike.
you took care of me in denver, and I still owe you for that.
but we're even now.
copy that. I'llet back to you as soon as we're there.
we got a lead on gredenko. - How good a lead?
we'll know soon enough. It's just a few miles from here.
I want you to put together a tac team, we'll move out.
I need to stay behind. We're still processing.
fine.
Ryan, get your men together, come with me.
please. - yes, madom.
how are you holding up?
I can't believe this is happening.
it doesn't feel real.
I'm so sorry.
Sandra. Unfortunately, I need to ask you for your help.
there's an extremely volatile situation developing at the white house.
vice president daniels is about to launch a nuclear strike against the middle east.
a nuclear strike?
Yes. And the cabinet is behind him.
I've tried arguing against it, but no one's listening.
are they insane?
no. They're just scared.
before the attempted assassination on your brother, wayne was reaching out to the middle east governments to solicit their help in stopping fayed.
and it was working.
this strike is a complete reversal of everything that he was working for.
you want dr. Welton to bring him out of the coma.
Yes.
and I need your consent.
but the doctor said that he needs to remain sedated for a few days before the swelling can subside.
Yeah, but-but we don't have a few days.
Yeah, well, even if wayne regains consciousness, we don't know what state he'll be in, - physically or mentally. - But we won't know unless we try.
Sandra, I wouldn't dare to ask you to risk this if I did not think it was absolutely necessary for the sake of our country.
I'm sorry, I can't do it.
Sandra, please.
I've already lost one brother.
I can't lose another one.
I know you did not ask for this responsibility, but like it or not, it is yours.
Wayne palmer is still the president of our country.
he's the only one who c stop this from happening, and you are the only one who can give him the chance to do what he believes in.
give him that chance.
ask yourself what wayne would want you to do.
I'll talk to dr. Welton.
and god forgive me if I'm wrong.
the uss vickery has been detached from carrier group falcon, which is currently on patrol in the region.
now, the vickery will reach launch position in 40 minutes.
so, in less than an hour, we'll have made our point to the enemy?
Yes, mr. Vice president.
the b-611 short-range tactical warhead has a blast yield of 300 kilotons.
he message will be loud and clear.
very good, admiral. Exemplary.
Tom, give us the damage and casualty estimates you got from complan.
Tom? - I'm sorry, sir.
is there a problem? - No. No, no.
um, this projection is, of course, based on theoretical models generated at our nuclear facility in alamogordo.
Com...complan estimates a high range of general damage by zone, as well as multiple casualty numbers based on various climate models.
now, should the... - I'm sorry, tom.
I need to step out for a minute.
carry on with the briefing. - Right.
uh, should the enemy mount a response, the potential does exist for the us to be drawn into a conflict in which its troops...
Noah: What the hell does this mean, they're taking him out of the coma?
apparently, sandra palmer gave her consent a few minutes ago.
this is karen hayes.
I don't know, sir.
I only found out about this because I have a source inside the medical bay.
put me through to dr. Welton.
okay. I've cut the pentobarbital drip.
his metabolic rate's up, and he's breathing on his own.
what about the swelling in his brain?
no sign of intracranial hypertension, but it's still too early to know when or even if he'll regain consciousness.
Dr. Welton, vice president daniels on line one. He says it's urgent.
Dr. Welton, what-what are you going to tell him?
the truth.
Mr. Vice president, this is dr. Welton.
I've just been told you're trying to rouse the president out of his coma.
that's correct, sir.
I thought you induced the coma to save the president's life.
treating patients with head trauma's a fluid process.
sounds to me like you're risking the life of the president of the united states.
with careful monitoring, we can minimize that risk.
let's cut the crap, doctor. - Sir?
we both know what's going on here, why sandra palmer wants her brother conscious.
she's trying to subvert my policy agenda.
policy's not my concern.
Oh, I think you're very concerned, and I think you agree with what she's doing, and you're willing to risk the life of the president to get it done.
so if you don't stop now, I will compel you to stop.
with all due respect, sir, the president's medical treatment is not under...
you'll do what I tell you.
no, sir. I'm sorry, I will not.
I am required to follow the wishes of sandra palmer.
you're free to take up your concerns with her.
if the president dies or suffers any permanent damage from your actions,
I will nail your ass to the wall. Do you understand me?
perfectly, sir.
Chloe, I need that photo. I need it now.
sending now, jack.
team b, advise when you're in position.
team b in position.
copy that. I've got a positive id.
move in on the house now, move in on the house now!
federal agent! Get on the floor! Don't move!
do what they say, brady.
put him in a chair.
take him in the living room now. Let's go.
he doesn't know anything.
shut up!
he's got some arterial bleeding.
we need to get him to a hospital.
we don't have time. Do whatever you have to to stabilize him.
I know you're scared right now, but everything's going to be okay.
I want to see my brother.
I'm going to let you see your brother, but I need to ask you some questions first.
I'm not allowed.
you're not allowed? Why?
mark says, don't talk to strangers.
I'm not a stranger. I'm a police officer. You can talk to me.
it's all right.
my name is jack bauer. What's yours?
Brady, when we came in, you were working on your computer.
what were you working on?
g-getting files.
what kind of files?
I don't know.
mark asked me to get through the ipc firewall to set up a proxy server port.
Oh. Can I see him now?
soon. I'm going to talk to him first, and then you can see him, okay?
you're doing great, brady.
stay with him.
you were getting paid to give dmitri gredenko information.
you used your brother to get that information.
now he's in a lot of trouble.
my brother's got nothing to do with this.
that's not what he told me.
he doesn't know what he's doing.
that's not how the justice department's going to see it.
they're going to prosecute him for treason unless I intervene.
now I'll help your brother because you and I both know he didn't understand what he was doing, but you're going to have to give me gredenko.
what kind of information were you selling him?
security specs.
what security specs?
the edgemont nuclear power plant.
bill, this is connell johnson.
he's on loan from district.
we swept the drone pilot's system.
most of the hard drives and data files are encrypted.
our digital forensics people are expecting you.
we'll see what we can find.
have you gotten anything more from nadia?
she still claims she was set up.
is she in the building?
Yeah. She's being transferred to a holding facility.
why do you ask? - Just curious.
sir, jack's on line two. He's got hauser in custody.
bill, hauser admitted to selling gredenko the security specs for edgemont nuclear power facility.
does gredenko have the specs?
not yet. He's going to pick them up in about 20 minutes.
can your team handle the grab?
we've got a situation.
hauser was wounded, but he's got a brother that gredenko knows.
we're going to use him to go through with the transaction.
right now, it's the best shot we've got of getting gredenko alive.
I'll get back to you as soon as I've got anything.
Brady, we need to talk.
are you really a-a policeman? - Yeah.
Then...my brother did something wrong.
he's made some mistakes, but he's helping us fix them.
everyone makes mistakes.
I make mistakes all the time.
and you try and fix them, right? - Yeah.
that's what your brother's trying to do, but he needs your help.
why don't we go talk to him?
okay.
come on, let's go.
it's okay, brady. It's okay.
it's not as bad as it looks.
they're taking me to the hospital.
I want to go with you, mark.
you need to stay with them.
don't leave me alone, mark, please.
listen to me, brady.
listen.
you need to do whatever this man tells you to do.
you'll be fine.
who takes care of you, brady?
y-you do, mark.
that's right.
so you need to trust me when I tell you you'll be fine.
he'll take care of you.
okay?
o-okay.
let's make the call.
Yes. - It's hauser.
I have the security protocols, but there's a problem.
what problem?
my supervisor wants me to come in.
I'll be there in 20 minutes.
he wants me at the office now.
if I'm not there in ten minutes, the protocols will default, and I'll have to download them all over again.
I need those protocols.
I can leave them with my brother.
unless you want to wait for me to get back from the office.
I don't have time.
have your brother meet me in the parking lot across the street.
he'll be there.
good-bye.
the parking lot.
across the street. 20 minutes.
he needs to get to a hospital now.
take him.
Brady, it's all right. It's all right.
we're going to take care of him, I promise.
right now, I need you to listen to me very carefully, just like your brother told you to.
okay?
OK
Connell johnson. I'm on loan from district.
data forensics.
Yeah, I think we crossed paths in denver.
that's right, we did.
what can I do for you?
well, I hear you and nadia yassir are friends.
Yeah. Why do you ask?
because I came across evidence at the switching station that proves nadia's innocent.
explain.
she wasn't streaming intel.
her system was breached.
where is this evidence?
ask doyle. - Doyle?
I hate to be a platoon rat, but I don't know where else to go.
I gave him the evidence at the crime scene, and he still hasn't logged it in.
thank you.
make sure jack's team has a full surveillance package with infrared capability.
why'd you do it, you son of a bitch?
are you crazy?! - Milo, hat's enough!
tell him! Tell...
he's got evidence that nadia's innocent!
is this true?
and he buried it to save his own ass.
he didn't bury it. Milo.
he didn't bury it.
it's a remote access module that breached nadia's computer.
he gave it to me ten minutes ago.
why didn't you tell us about this?
because I got it from an unreliable source.
I wanted to make sure it was real before I submitted it for evidence.
I ran a verification scan.
it's definitely real, and nadia is definitely innocent.
I'll review the evidence.
if it's true, I'll release nadia.
in the meantime, go back to work!
come with me, morris.
owe you an apology.
it's not your fault.
still.
Milo, forget about it.
you have screwed with the wrong guy for the last time, pal.
uncuff her.
excuse us, please.
we found evidence at the switching station.
it proves your computer was breached from an outside source.
you're cleared, nadia.
I'm sorry this happened.
so am I.
your first impulse will be to quit, take legal action.
I don't blame you.
that's what I'd do.
but I'm asking you to stay.
this crisis is far from over.
we can't afford to lose our best people.
we need you, nadia.
I'll stay.
Milo's setting up your workstation now.
I just sent over the assault vectors. Nadia should be good to go.
thank you.
we all thought she was guilty.
this is going to be awkward.
Yeah.
especially for you.
why especially for me?
your feelings for nadia aren't exactly a big secret.
thank you for pointing that out.
your station's all set.
comm's up.
you'll have full security access to the subnet.
Thanks.
listen, nadia, I just...
look, milo, I don't have time for a heart-to-heart right now, okay?
I got a lot of catching up to do.
excuse me.
I understand that.
Nadia, wait.
damn it!
you're not going to make this easy for me, are you?
you know what? Actually, I am.
whatever you thought might happen between us, you can just forget iT.
that's not fair.
Milo, believe it or t, I don't even blame you for suspecting me.
but you have to admit, this is not the best place to start a relationship.
you're probably right.
but I still wanted to say I'm sorry.
you said it.
I should get to work.
here.
Thanks.
we haven't heard from dr. Welton, and he's been giving us regular updates.
well, I'm sure if there was something to report, we would have heard from him.
Oh, gosh. I've never been good at waiting for anything.
david had the patience of job.
but not me.
Wayne is always somewhere in between.
we have a decision to make.
what is it?
there's an increase in intracranial swelling.
how serious is it?
it's not life-threatening yet, but if it continues, it could cause permanent brain damage.
I suggest we re-induce the coma.
no.
Sandra, you understand the danger?
Yeah, but there's a chance he'd be okay.
Yes, there's a chance.
well, even if it's a small chance for waynto stop daniels, then it's worth the risk.
I know wayne would want to see this through.
Dr. Welton?
you need to come quickly.
he's crashing. Get a code team in here right away.
wait outside!
code team to one!
code team to one, stat!
teams are in position.
you sure he can do this?
he just needs to get gredenko out of his car.
we don't have another option.
just tell charlie team they've got one shot at this.
damn it.
Brady, i need you to wear one of these.
so we can talk to each other.
this way, you'll be able to hear me, and I can hear you.
I need to put it in your ear.
will, uh, it hurt?
no.
no, I promise.
see?
now, I'm going to talk you through this.
but we don't want mr. Gredenko to know that you can hear me.
so we have to pretend that you can'T.
you understand?
Yeah.
good.
you're going to give him this.
he's going to meet you in the parking lot across the street.
I want you to stand on the sidewalk.
that's your position.
okay.
we're set.
we should go now.
you don't need to be scared, brady. Everything's going to be fine.
I'm going to be able to watch you the whole time, and I'm going to be able to hear everything that you say.
now, I need you to go to your position.
you remember the position we talked about?
Yeah. I'm going to go to my position.
okay.
all teams, report in.
alpha team, in position.
Bravo team, in position.
Charlie team, in position.
Charlie team, you are responsible for taking out gredenko with the tranquilizer dart.
teams a and b, I want you to acquire remaining targets.
do whatever you have to, to protect this kid.
Brady, it's jack. Can you hear me?
I hear you.
you're doing great.
when can I see my brother?
as soon as this is over, I promise.
okay. Okay, good.
I have a visual on gredenko's suv.
windows are tinted.
I can't see who's inside.
do you see the car that's coming towards you?
Yeah.
it's time to get ready.
I got a visual on gredenko.
Charlie team, take your shot as soon as you've got one.
copy that.
do you have it?
yeah give it to me.
I have a negative line of sight.
hauser's in the way.
you look nervous, brady.
why are you so nervous?
Gredenko just gave the order to shoot the kid as soon as the information's been verified.
Charlie team, do you have your shot yet?
negative. Hauser's still in the way.
can you move position?
negative.
don't forget to pretend like you can't hear me.
you're doing great.
I want you to listen to me very carefully.
when I tell you, I want you to go down to the ground and stay there.
wait till I tell you.
Brady, get down on the ground.
Brady, get down on the ground!
all teams, take out your targets.
all teams, there's a third hostile inside the vehicle!
Brady, are you okay?
it's over. It's over.
you did great.
I want to see my brother.
okay.
you can see your brother just like I promised.
get gredenko back in the house.
prep him. Contact ctu.
advise buchanan that we've got gredenko in custody and we're prepping him for interrogation.
Yes, sir.
watch your head.
Brady, this man's going to look after you.
he's going to take you to see your brother.
I want to see my brother.
Yeah.
you did great.
thank you.
we searched gredenko's vehicle and the surrounding area.
there's no sign of the bombs.
is he conscious yet?
Yes. You want help with him?
no.
you know who I am?
I know all about you, agent bauer.
then you know what I'm going to do to you unless you tell me where the bombs are.
and when I'm finished, I'm going to put you on the fastest plane we've got back to russia.
I don't think president suvarov's going to be too happy to see you.
Fayed has the bombs.
where is he?
I don't know. But I can help you find him.
I'm listening.
I came here to get security specs for the edgemont nuclear power plant.
that's your next target.
Yes. Fayed's waiting for my call.
make the call.
no.
first, my terms.
amnesty from your government.
and a guarantee I won't be returned to russia.
what?
I'm offering you fayed.
what's the problem?
I'm not martyr.
I'm soldier.
and realist.
if I don't call him soon, fayed will get suspicious.
Admiral smith, is the vickery ready to launch?
it's seconds from optimal launch position, mr. Vice president.
Mr. Vice president. - Yes, tom?
just spoke to bill buchanan at ctu.
they've taken gredenko into custody.
Jack bauer is questioning him now.
does bill think there's a chance this could lead to something?
well, he's confident that bauer's the man for the interrogation, and he's hoping they get the answers they need.
I hope his confidence is justified.
sir, the vickery's in position.
they're standing by.
proceed with the strike.
Yes, mr. Vice president.
Mr. Vice president, if I may.
in light of the developments at ctu, do we not want to delay this launch and just see what bauer gets out of gredenko?
I'm not going to delay our response based on what gredenko may or may not reveal.
but if gredenko gives up the bombs, then surely that is the desired result...
then we can consider this strike as retaliation for american lives already lost!
a reminder to the world there are consequences to attacking our country.
Admiral smith...
proceed with the launch.
Yes, mr. Vice president.
sir, the vickery just received a message over the complan subnet.
they've been ordered to stand down.
what the hell are you talking about?
who gave ts order?
president palmer, sir.
president palmer?
conference room, lisa miller.
one moment.
it's for you, sir.
Yes.
Noah...it's waynE.
Mr. President.
it is an incredible relief to hear your voice.
to be frank, it's a surprise.
I've called off the strike, noah.
we just received word.
sir, this action is a product of careful deliberation between myself and the joint chiefs.
Yeah, well, be that as it may, the decision is mine and mine alone.
I'm resuming my duties as commander in chief.
inform admiral smith and the others, there's to be no hostile action without my direct authorization.
is that understood?
understood, mr. President.
good.
it's apparent to me that...
the president is still suffering the effects from the attack on his life.
he's not thinking clearly, and in my judgment, he's not capable of discharging his duties.
I can't let him remain in power.
get me the attorney general.
we have a successful launch.
good.
Mr. President, my government has alerted me of the nuclear weapon heading toward my country.
that's correct, Mr. Ambassador, we've made good on our threat.
we've identified a general in our central command-- general Mohmar Habib, who has also been in contact with Fayed.
he's been helping orchestrate the attacks on your country.
I really hope protecting this man was worth pushing us to the brink of world war Ⅲ.
I've never found pharmaceutical torture all that affective.
I have.
if this is supposed to frighten me, you're wasting your time.
I won't tell you a thing.
watch out!
we staged a fake rescue of Fayed by CTU agents posing as members of a terrorist cell with loyalties to Habib.
he wants us to help you rendezvous with your men.
where do you want us to take you?
if you take your orders from general Habib as I do, how is it I've nev heard of you?
Jamal's still alive.
stay with him, call in a medic.
CTU, the bombs are secure.
Hello?
Jack, are you there?
can you hear me?
help me, Jack.
Hello, Mr. Bauer.
Yes, ms. Raines is alive.
if you wish her to remain that way, you will call me back in ten minutes.
if you make any attempt to find our location, she dies.
cheng.
the following takes place between 11PM&12AM
agent Bauer, you really do need to get to a hospital.
but I understand the circumstances.
at least this will help you with the pain.
thank you.
Hey, Jack, so the marines, they're going to secure the nukes and prepare them for transport.
they're calling the shots now.
the military's taking over?
Yeah, according to presidential order.
I guess dod doesn't want CTU in charge anymore.
so Buchanan, he wants you to call him as soon as the nukes are ready for transport to a nest facility.
can you handle that for me?
sure.
what?
I just...I know you've been through hell.
not just today, but the last couple of years, and...
I just wanted to thank you for what you did today, 'cause it could have ended a hell of a lot worse.
and it would have if you weren't here.
I appreciate that.
excuse me.
this is Bauer, let me speak to Audrey.
you've already spoken to her.
I want to make sure she's all right.
her well-being is entirely up to you, Mr. Bauer.
everyone has given up on you. Everyone, except for ms. Raines.
over the objections of your government, her family, her friends, she came to Beijing, just to find you.
since you proved to be a uncooperative prisoner, we felt she would be an asset we might be able to exploit one day.
and that day is here.
I will hand myself over to you.
tell me where.
a man who won't break is of no use to us, but the Russian suitcase nukes you captured...
Why?
your country has the technology to build those weapons.
it's not the weapons themselves we're interested in.
what we want is a component from the triggering mechanism.
it contains a prototype algorithm...
old enough to be free of any modern decryption safeguards.
with it, we'll have access to virtually all Russian defense technology.
it's a simple exchange.
you give me the component, I give you Audrey.
if you refuse, I kill her.
the Russians will know that we supplied you with the algorithm.
you would be starting world war Ⅲ.
I suggest we leave that to the diplomats to sort out.
even if I wanted to, the bombs are under military control.
I couldn't get anywhere near them.
you'll find a waY.
if I'm going to agree to this, I want to speak to Audrey now.
very well.
speak to him.
are you all right?
did they hurt you no. Jack...I...I'm sorry.
you have nothing to be sorry for.
the only thing that's important is that you're alive.
I know what they're asking for.
I can handle it.
I promise you, I'm going to get you out of there.
just don't be frightened.
you have one hour to call this number when you're ready to make the exchange.
an hour's not going to give me enough time.
cheng.
cheng!
you know, you really should work from medical, sir.
come on, at least they can monitor you there.
I'm fine, Tom.
I don't think that you are, sir.
and neither does dr. Welton.
putting myself under medical supervision might give the vice president yet another pretext to try and take a run at my job.
you don't need to worry about that, sir.
what exactly do you have on vice president Daniels?
I have the truth, sir.
now is the time that I need to know what that is.
it is a tape recording of vice president Daniels conspiring with Lisa Miller to commit perjury at your competency hearing.
I'd love to hear that as soon as possible.
Mr. President, Tom.
I have good news.
CTU has recovered the two remaining suitcase nukes.
when?
just a few minutes ago.
I just got off the phone with Bill.
he's waiting to brief you as soon as you're ready.
what about Fayed?
he and his men were killed during the assault.
then it's over.
well, it certainly seems so, sir. Congratulations.
the American people should know.
and I want to tell them that we're no longer at risk of a nuclear attack.
I'll have the press corps down here in 30 minutes.
no, no, Karen.
we're going to do this from upstairs, in the press room.
should we wait for clearance from secret service?
no, Tom, there's no need for any of us to be hiding underground for a minute longer.
inform secret service that we'll be leaving the bunker and returning to the oval office.
Yes, sir.
Morris is coordinating with the marines technical escort unit to transfer the bombs to a nest facility.
now that they've taken custody,
I'd like you all to submit your briefings to the respective department heads.
I'd like to share my pride in the work that you've all done.
we were hit hard.
but not one of you gave up.
you've done excellent work today.
Hey, it's me.
Jack. You did it.
Chloe, listen to me. I need your help.
well, can't it wait?
we're just transferring the bombs, and doing cleanup.
no, it can'T.
what is it?
Chloe, Audrey's still alive.
no, she's not.
Yes, she is, I just talked to her.
the Chinese faked her car accident.
they've been holding her a prisoner since she was in Beijing trying to find me.
Oh, my god.
we have to tell Mr. Buchanan.
he'll never go along with it.
go along with what?
the Chinese want to exchange Audrey for an fb-sub-circuit board from one of the nukes.
it'll give them complete access to Russian defense technology.
I want you to help me retrieve one of those circuit boards.
Jack, we both know that if we do this, it will create an international situation big time.
Chloe, I know.
I promise I will do whatever I have to to stop the Chinese from getting that circuit board.
but right now I need you to get me the schematics for those bombs.
those files aren't on my system.
they were reclassified when the dod took possession of the suitcase nuke you disarmed.
then you're going to have to figure out a way to get them, 'cause without those schematics, I won't know what I'm looking for.
Yes, I understand, but I don't know how I can do this.
Chloe, Audrey's life is at stake.
think.
wait.
he had to file a report with dod about the work he did on the nukes.
it contained a revised schematic.
it might still be on his hard drive.
can you access it?
only directly from his terminal.
Chloe, please, do it.
where do you want me to send it?
to the cell phone that I'm calling you from.
use a secure line-- alpha-539.
hold on.
it's here.
the file's coming up.
I'm sending it to your screen.
stand by.
copy that.
come on.
Chloe, I don't see anything.
it needs to load before it sends.
there's still 30% to go. Damn it.
what?
Morris is coming back to his station.
hurry.
there's nothing I can do.
I need to log out now. He's here.
no, Chloe, wait.
I got it.
yes?
Mr. President, the vice president is here.
send him in.
please sit.
listen, I,uh...
I want to begin by expressing my gratitude to you.
for a lesson well learned.
I'm not sure what you mean by that, Mr. President.
I still believe attacking Abu Fayed's country with a nuclear weapon would have been a serious mistake, Noah; I'm not going lie to you about that.
but...
if you hadn't put that option on the table in the first place,
I never would've gone as far as I did.
and the bombs might still be out there.
that being said...
I think we would both agree that our relationship has always been a marriage of convenience.
a way to strengthen the ticket, rather than a case of us actually seeing eye to eye on pretty much anything.
and now that it's over, this crisis, it's become clear to me, Noah, that I just don't think it's possible for us to work together anymore.
excuse me?
I'm asking for your resignation.
how dare you.
you don't have the right to ask for my resignation.
this isn't about what the constitution says, Noah.
it's about what's best for this country in a time of crisis.
how in the world do you figure that?
I can't lead effectively with you undermining me at every single opportunity that you may get.
now let's be honest with each other.
that's exactly what you would do if you stayed in place.
Mr. President...
I refuse.
good night.
you don't want to walk out that door.
not like this.
otherwise I may have to make this extremely unpleasant for you.
now what are you talking about?
I'm talking about the recording that Tom Lennox has in his possession.
that's what I'm talking about.
conspiracy to commit perjury is a serious offense.
now I have to assume you'd rather resign, than spend the rest of your life living with that kind of humiliation.
so is resorting to blackmail your idea of effective leadership?
if there is anything I've learned anything from you, Noah, it would be that sometimes it's necessary to apply a little brute force.
I don't need your resignation immediately.
let's give the country a chance to take a breath after what happened today.
some time in the next week will be just fine, Mr. Vice president.
nest wants a flight path cleared to Edwards for 20 miles in each direction.
could you get back to me with confirmation?
thank you.
ETA on the helicopter that will transport the bombs is 15 minutes.
you should distribute protocols to the nest team.
I'm on that.
that's odd.
what?
I think someone's hacked into my system.
are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
ever since what happened to Nadia,
I installed a logging program to track any unauthorized access to my hard drive.
you did?
it's telling me that someone accessed my files ten minutes ago...
and downloaded the updated schematics to those suitcase nukes.
I'm calling security.
wait! Don't call security.
I'm the one who hacked into your system.
why would you do that?
I'll explain it to you in a little while.
explain it to me now.
I did it for Jack.
Audrey Raines is still alive.
the Chinese are holding her hostage.
what?
they're going to kill her unless Jack delivers an fb-sub-circuit board from one of the bombs to them.
you've been to all the same briefings.
the Russians have been trying to keep that technology out of Chinese hands for years.
I know.
well, what are the Russians going to say when they find out we just gave it to them?
it's not going to get that far.
how in the world do you know it's not going to get that far?
because Jack gave me his word.
I'm sorry, darling. I can't leave it at that.
Yes, you can.
the bombs that I reprogrammed for Fayed could have killed tens of thousands of people.
but that didn't happen.
I know what it felt like to think that I could've been responsible for each and everyone of their deaths.
I can't be involved with something that could easily end up starting a war.
it's not going to start a war because it's not going to get that far.
besides, this has nothing to do with you. I did it.
Yes, it does.
now that you've told me, it does.
you have to tell Buchanan.
I can'T.
then you're forcing me to.
no.
I'm going to do it.
No! Morris! - I'm doing it.
I'll tell him.
reinforcements aren't necessary at this point.
the military is guarding the bombs.
there's a CTU swat team standing by.
they'll be en route soon.
all right, thank you.
what is it, Chloe?
Mr. Buchanan...
I'm sorry, there's something that you need to know.
you two, come with me.
sir, this area's off-limits.
I'm agent Bauer.
I was the man that was responsible for securing these nukes.
I'm under a presidential order to remove the fb-circuit board from one of these bombs, have it transferred back to CTU for immediate analysis.
we don't have much time. This building has been compromised.
now open the gate.
sir, no one is allowed in here.
are you countermanding a presidential order?
how dare you, sergeant?!
now you're wasting my time.
what's your name?
what's your name?!
I want your name, too. Now!
that's not necessary.
open the gate. Open the gate!
I want both of you to stand guard while I remove the circuit board.
come on!
stand down, Jack!
I can't do that.
I won't say it again! - Drop it.
agent Doyle, I am following orders that exceed your security clearance!
he's a rogue agent.
take him out! - I will shoot!
put your weapon down or I will shoot you!
take him! Now!
secure him, he's under arrest.
Doyle, please. Just listen to me.
ll, we've got Jack.
what did he say? - Not much. I had to subdue him.
let me talk to him. - Hold on.
Buchanan wants to talk to you.
Jack, Chloe just told me about Audrey and the Chinese.
I can't let you give them the component.
I'm not going to.
I only need to have it long enough for them to let her go.
I was never going to let the Chinese keep it, Bill, I swear to you.
whatever you have planned, Jack, I can't let you do it.
bill, please...
right now we're the only chance she's got.
I understand what Audrey means to you.
I promise I will do everything in my power to get her back.
you didn't even know she was alive.
cheng is going to make it impossible for us to ever find her again.
we are her only hope and you know it.
I don't know what to tell you, Jack, except let Doyle bring you back here and we'll work out a game plan.
will you let me make one more call?
I'm asking you as a friend.
who do you want to talk to?
president Wayne Palmer.
I'll see if I can reach him.
let me talk to Doyle. - Yeah.
he wants to talk to you.
keep Jack in custody while I try to contact the president.
I'll route the call through your cell. - Yes, sir. I understand.
get him up.
white house sources have confirmed that terrorist leader Abu Fayed is dead.
the president has reportedly recovered from injuries sustained from the failed attempt on his life, and he is expected to make a statement shortly regarding unconfirmed rumors...
yes?
Mr. President, Bill Buchanan has Jack Bauer on the line.
put him through, please.
go ahead. - Please hold for the president.
it's the presidenT.
excuse me.
Mr. President. - Yes, Jack. Congratulations.
is everything still all right? - Yes, sir. The bombs are secure.
but I'm calling because I want you to authorize a field operation.
for what purpose? - To save Audrey Raines.
what? - Mr. President, she's still alive.
the Chinese have been holding her for the past few months.
now they're using her as a bargaining chip.
in exchange for what?
for an fb-sub-circuit board from one of the nukes.
they say they'll release Audrey unharmed if I bring it to them.
it's my understanding, Jack, that component holds the key to Russian defense codes.
Yes, sir, I'm aware of that.
I'm sympathetic, I am, and I promise you that I will make available to you the full resources of this country to get Audrey back, and I promise you that I will make available to you the full resources of this country to get Audrey back, but I hope you're not expecting me to authorize this exchange.
not exactly. - Then what exactly?
Mr. President, I need the Chinese to believe that I am willing to go through with this exchange.
I need to have that component on me. They're going to need to see it.
as soon as I know that Audrey is free, I will destroy it.
and how can you guarantee that?
I'm asking you to trust me, Mr. President.
I give you my word that that component will not end up in Chinese hands.
but if it does, the Russians, despite our peace accord, may take action against us for allowing it to happen.
now, under most circumstances, yes, your word would be sufficient, but in this case, Jack, I need to know details.
if I have to, I will destroy that circuit board with a concealed charge of c-4.
an explosion of c-4 would take out anything within 30 feet of it.
you're going to sacrifice yourself? - Yes, sir, if I have to.
Jack... - Mr. President, please.
please, I am begging you.
Audrey Raines was willing to give up her life to save mine.
I cannot and will not do anything less for her.
you're asking me to sign off on a probable suicide mission.
with all due respect, Mr. President, 16 hours ago, your people were willing to hand me over for dead, and I did not hesitate.
Mr. President, you owe me.
and you're sure this is the only way?
Yes.
all right, then.
I will not fail you, Mr. President.
I'll tell Bill to give you whatever you need.
now I'm going to need confirmation that circuit board has been destroyed after Audrey has been released.
I'll have CTU embed a tracking device in the board.
you'll have your confirmation.
good luck, Jack. - Thank you, Mr. President.
Yes, sir. - Let me speak with Bill Buchanan.
Yes, sir. I understand.
get over here.
what did he say?
Buchanan said the president signed off on this, and to give you whatever help you need.
I'm going to need someone to help me with Audrey's extraction during the exchange.
I want that to be you.
fine. Where are you going to be?
the name of the Chinese agent that's holding Audrey is Cheng Zhi
he was responsible for my interrogation and torture for almost two years in that chinese prison.
as soon as I get the signal from you that Audrey is safe, two things are going to happen.
I'm going to destroy that circuit board, and Cheng Zhi isn't going to make it out of here alive.
and Cheng Zhi sn't going to make it out of here alive.
so, in answer to your question, where am I going to be?
wherever I have to.
let's go.
are you going to tell me what happened?
the president agreed to Jack's plan.
the president's going to allow Jack to hand over a defense algorithm to the Chinese?
no. Of course not.
Jack will destroy the component as soon as he knows Audrey's safe.
the Chinese will never get it.
and how is he going to manage that?
I don't know. I guess president Palmer trusts him.
telling Buchanan was the right thing to do. You know it was.
it doesn't matter. You should have trusted me.
trusted you?
you're the one that broke into my system.
that's because I didn't think you'd back me up. Obviously, I was right.
so you're going to hold this over my head now, are you?
Yeah. For a long time.
for how long? Could you give me an estimate?
I'll get back to you.
Doyle's on line three.
they're going to lock you on the tracker frequency.
this is Nadia. - It's me. The tracker's on line.
the frequency marker is alpha-1793.
signal's good. You're on the grid. - Copy. Jack and I are getting ready to move out.
yes?
I have the circuit board. Where am I going?
get on the 180 and head north.
get off the first exit after mile marker 49.
I will give you further instructions when you've exited.
I got it.
you have a half an hour.
I don't think I need to remind you what would happen if you are late.
I understand.
CTU has the signal. They're monitoring the device.
I'm set. Let's go.
Jack, you're taking a hell of a risk.
if this goes sour, it could stir a firestorm. And for what?
if you were in my shoes, you wouldn't do the same thing?
I don't mix relationships with my job.
whatever you had with this woman, I hope it's worth it.
this isn't about what I had with a woman.
her name is Audrey Raines.
she served this country with honor. We owe her.
so get in the truck.
come in.
you wanted to see me?
close the door.
the president has just asked me to resign.
what?
and I'm going to comply with his request.
I wanted to tell you personally before you found out from someone else.
I don't understand.
why are you going along with this? Why don't you just tell him that you refuse?
he has a tape of our conversation.
the one where we conspire to commit perjury, and he's threatening to use it against me unless I step down.
Oh, my god.
Tom Lennox recorded it.
bottom line is,
I'm not being given a choice here.
this is all my fault.
if I hadn't asked you to lie about Karen Hayes, none of this would be happening.
you were just trying to protect me. I could have turned you down, but I didn'T.
don't blame yourself.
I'm so sorry.
I don't know what to say.
Aw, hell, at least we'll have a lot more time to spend together.
at least we'll have a lot more time to spend together.
the president said to take a week, but I want this...
etter of resignation in his hands by the time he finishes his press conference.
I am through being the loyal opposition.
please, sit.
first, I want to say that I'm grateful to report that Abu Fayed, the man responsible for these attacks, has been killed, and that all nuclear devices have been recovered.
I want to take the time to acknowledge the brave men and women in our various law enforcement agencies, and let us not forget our armed services.
all these people have worked so hard to bring this crisis to an end.
their dedication, their perseverance is without equal.
despite the brutality of these attacks, we did not allow the violence born of extremism to push us to extremes.
and, as Americans, we can and should take pride and comfort in that fact.
let me conclude by asking for your prayers tonight for all those who grieve this day.
for all those whose lives have been shattered.
let us reach out and begin the process of rebuilding.
let us reach out and begin the process of national healing.
thank you.
I'll take some of your questions now.
Yes. Ian.
Mr. President, how certain are you that the crisis is, in fact, over, and that there are no more of these weapons on American soil?
well, based on the intelligence that I've seen,
I can say with full confidence, Ian, that the worst has passed, and that the individuals responsible for these attacks have been apprehended, or else killed.
Yes, Andrea.
Robin, sir.
Robin, yes. Robin.
I'm sorry, it's been a, it's been a very long day.
please, go ahead.
Mr. President, there are several thousand muslim Americans still being held in detention facilities across the country.
what's going to happen to these people?
I've already directed homeland security to begin dismantling these detention facilities.
all detainees are to be released once the immediate crisis is passed.
excuse me.
um, now that the crisis has passed, we will be, um...
we will be reviewing the situation regarding individuals that we have in custody.
I'm sorry. I'm, not, uh,
I'm not being very clear.
uh, let me say again regarding your question, Andrea, that...Robin.
I'm sorry. Robin.
let me say again regarding...
regarding your question that the, uh...
the detention facilities that, that, that we will, uh...
we, we're going ...
Oh, my god. - Get medical right away!
code 4. Repeat, code 4.
we need an emergency medical team to the press room.
get these people out of here.
ladies and gentlemen, we need to clear this room.
please exit by the south door.
all signs indicate the president has suffered a cerebral hemorrhage brought on by injuries he sustained earlier in the day.
meaning he never should have been brought out of the coma.
however detrimental that decision was to his health,
I'm confident that in light of his actions today, he would continue to support it.
I'm glad you're so confident, Karen, since it was your reckless action that resulted in his stroke.
sir, it's unclear if the stroke was inevitable, but in any event, I'll take full responsibility.
excuse me.
now is not the time for recriminations, self-imposed or otherwise.
doctor, when will we know the extent of the damage and the prospects for recovery?
after the MRI.
the president is being prepped for transport to Bethesda as we speak.
based on my impressions, the damage was severe.
I don't think we can expect the president to regain consciousness anytime soon.
so it is incontestable Wayne Palmer won't be able to continue his duties as commander-in-chief.
there's no denying that this is a great tragedy for the nation and...
for those of us who know the president personally.
just...take care of him, doctor.
of course.
excuse me.
notify the senate and the house of the transfer of power and have the sec def and the chairman of the joint chiefs authorize me under the 25 amendment.
Yes, sir.
have the press secretary issue a statement.
president Palmer's been...
incapacitated.
no need for alarm.
executive authority's been transferred to me.
Our...hopes and prayers are with him.
all right, sir.
and I'll also need you available to review everything on the president's agenda.
all right, sir.
actually, there's something on the agenda I think you'll want immediate clarification on.
what's that?
Wayne Palmer just issued a finding allowing Jack Bauer to hand classified Russian technology over to the Chinese in exchange for the return of a covertly held hostage.
can you explain this?
Yes. That was a personal request from Jack Bauer to the president.
they have a longstanding relationship and as Jack Bauer was largely responsible for recovering the suitcase nukes today, the president wanted to honor his service to this country
Karen, I asked you to explain it, not excuse it.
understood.
Bauer has guaranteed that the technology will not fall into the hands of the Chinese.
it will only be used to secure the hostage.
incidentally, sir, the hostage in question is Audrey Raines, daughter of James Heller.
even Jack Bauer can't guarantee that outcome.
now, I am happy to honor agent Bauer's service to this country, but not at the risk of giving classified technology to the Chinese and...
potentially damaging our relationship with Russia in the process.
you tell CTU to stop Bauer-- immediately.
sir.
the president expressly...
that's all for now, Karen.
you, too, Tom.
unbelievable.
less than a minute behind his desk and he's already disregarding the president's wishes.
nevertheless, we both share Daniel's unease in handing military secrets over to the Chinese.
I know, Tom, but that is not the point.
no, here's the point.
Daniels is now the acting president, whether we like it or not.
I'm off to the hospital.
I'll see you there.
Buchanan.
Hi, it's me.
how's president Palmer?
not good.
the doctor says that he has a cerebral hemorrhage they don't know the extent of the damage, but obviously he's not able to serve.
Daniels is going to assume the office, and the first wave of his hand, he wants to stop Jack's operation.
Jack has to return to CTU as soon as possible with the component.
does the vice president understand the circumstances under which Wayne Palmer agreed to this?
no.
he's not that kind of a man.
he doesn't operate in shades of gray.
does he understand Jack's not gonna give up without a fight?
you just have to get Jack back to CTU as soon as possible, okay?
okay, I'll take care of it.
listen up.
the white house has ordered us to shut down Jack's operation.
how far away are support teams?
six miles.
have them standing by, ready to move in, contact CHP.
have them set up roadblocks.
Chloe, I want you to stand down on this operation.
Why?
you've shown me I can't trust you.
Morris, you cover comm.
Jack's not gonna go along with this.
I know.
Doyle.
Mike, it's Bill.
can Jack hear you? Say yes or no.
Yes.
there's been a change in profile.
Noah Daniels is acting president.
he wants the operation shut down and Jack brought back to CTU immediately.
understood.
what's your current location?
we're about two miles east of the 180 interchange.
okay, I need you to exit at the 70, make the first left.
we'll have roadblocks set up with a backup team ready to take Jack intcustody and recover the component.
all right, we'll do that.
you need to disarm Jack as soon as quickly and quietly as possible before he finds out.
no problem.
CTU's got a report from cal trans. The 180's closed due to high winds.
they're concerned about possible fallout.
they want us to take 70 instead.
fine.
don't you move.
Jack, what's the problem?
earlier today, I shot my old partner, a friend of mine, because he tried to stop me from doing what I have to do.
don't think for a second I won't do that to you.
slowly I want you to pull over.
now.
take the keys out of the ignition. Put them on the center console. And your phone.
Jack, you don't want to do this.
slowly get out of the truck.
back up towards the fence.
Jack, listen to me. Daniels is the acting president.
he's the one who called this off.
shut up and grab the fence!
this is gonna end badly, Jack.
you can't go against the white house!
we have a successful launch.
good.
Mr. President, my government has alerted me of the nuclear weapon heading toward my country.
that's correct, Mr. Ambassador, we've made good on our threat.
we've identified a general in our central command-- general Mohmar Habib, who has also been in contact with Fayed.
he's been helping orchestrate the attacks on your country.
I really hope protecting this man was worth pushing us to the brink of world war Ⅲ.
I've never found pharmaceutical torture all that affective.
I have.
if this is supposed to frighten me, you're wasting your time.
I won't tell you a thing.
watch out!
we staged a fake rescue of Fayed by CTU agents posing as members of a terrorist cell with loyalties to Habib.
he wants us to help you rendezvous with your men.
where do you want us to take you?
if you take your orders from general Habib as I do, how is it I've nev heard of you?
Fayed's gone!
Jamal's still alive.
stay with him, call in a medic.
CTU, the bombs are secure.
Hello?
Jack, are you there?
can you hear me?
help me, Jack.
Hello, Mr. Bauer.
Yes, ms. Raines is alive.
if you wish her to remain that way, you will call me back in ten minutes.
if you make any attempt to find our location, she dies.
cheng.
the following takes place between 11PM&12AM
agent Bauer, you really do need to get to a hospital.
but I understand the circumstances.
at least this will help you with the pain.
thank you.
Hey, Jack, so the marines, they're going to secure the nukes and prepare them for transport.
they're calling the shots now.
the military's taking over?
Yeah, according to presidential order.
I guess dod doesn't want CTU in charge anymore.
so Buchanan, he wants you to call him as soon as the nukes are ready for transport to a nest facility.
can you handle that for me?
sure.
what?
I just...I know you've been through hell.
not just today, but the last couple of years, and...
I just wanted to thank you for what you did today, 'cause it could have ended a hell of a lot worse.
and it would have if you weren't here.
I appreciate that.
excuse me.
this is Bauer, let me speak to Audrey.
you've already spoken to her.
I want to make sure she's all right.
her well-being is entirely up to you, Mr. Bauer.
everyone has given up on you. Everyone, except for ms. Raines.
over the objections of your government, her family, her friends, she came to Beijing, just to find you.
since you proved to be a uncooperative prisoner, we felt she would be an asset we might be able to exploit one day.
and that day is here.
I will hand myself over to you.
tell me where.
a man who won't break is of no use to us, but the Russian suitcase nukes you captured...
Why?
your country has the technology to build those weapons.
it's not the weapons themselves we're interested in.
what we want is a component from the triggering mechanism.
it contains a prototype algorithm...
old enough to be free of any modern decryption safeguards.
with it, we'll have access to virtually all russian defense technology.
it's a simple exchange.
you give me the component, I give you Audrey.
if you refuse, I kill her.
the Russians will know that we supplied you with the algorithm.
you would be starting world war Ⅲ.
I suggest we leave that to the diplomats to sort out.
even if I wanted to, the bombs are under military control.
I couldn't get anywhere near them.
you'll find a waY.
if I'm going to agree to this, I want to speak to Audrey now.
very well.
speak to him.
are you all right?
did they hurt you no. Jack...I...I'm sorry.
you have nothing to be sorry for.
the only thing that's important is that you're alive.
I know what they're asking for.
I can handle it.
I promise you, I'm going to get you out of there.
just don't be frightened.
you have one hour to call this number when you're ready to make the exchange.
an hour's not going to give me enough time.
cheng.
cheng!
you know, you really should work from medical, sir.
come on, at least they can monitor you there.
I'm fine, Tom.
I don't think that you are, sir.
and neither does dr. Welton.
putting myself under medical supervision might give the vice president yet another pretext to try and take a run at my job.
you don't need to worry about that, sir.
what exactly do you have on vice president Daniels?
I have the truth, sir.
now is the time that I need to know what that is.
it is a tape recording of vice president Daniels conspiring with Lisa Miller to commit perjury at your competency hearing.
I'd love to hear that as soon as possible.
Mr. President, Tom.
I have good news.
CTU has recovered the two remaining suitcase nukes.
when?
just a few minutes ago.
I just got off the phone with Bill.
he's waiting to brief you as soon as you're ready.
what about Fayed?
he and his men were killed during the assault.
then it's over.
well, it certainly seems so, sir. Congratulations.
the American people should know.
and I want to tell them that we're no longer at risk of a nuclear attack.
I'll have the press corps down here in 30 minutes.
no, no, Karen.
we're going to do this from upstairs, in the press room.
should we wait for clearance from secret service?
no, Tom, there's no need for any of us to be hiding underground for a minute longer.
inform secret service that we'll be leaving the bunker and returning to the oval office.
Yes, sir.
Morris is coordinating with the marines technical escort unit to transfer the bombs to a nest facility.
now that they've taken custody,
I'd like you all to submit your briefings to the respective department heads.
I'd like to share my pride in the work that you've all done.
we were hit hard.
but not one of you gave up.
you've done excellent work today.
Hey, it's me.
Jack. You did it.
Chloe, listen to me. I need your help.
well, can't it wait?
we're just transferring the bombs, and doing cleanup.
no, it can'T.
what is it?
Chloe, Audrey's still alive.
no, she's not.
Yes, she is, I just talked to her.
the Chinese faked her car accident.
they've been holding her a prisoner since she was in Beijing trying to find me.
Oh, my god.
we have to tell Mr. Buchanan.
he'll never go along with it.
go along with what?
the Chinese want to exchange Audrey for an fb-sub-circuit board from one of the nukes.
it'll give them complete access to Russian defense technology.
I want you to help me retrieve one of those circuit boards.
Jack, we both know that if we do this, it will create an international situation big time.
Chloe, I know.
I promise I will do whatever I have to to stop the Chinese from getting that circuit board.
but right now I need you to get me the schematics for those bombs.
those files aren't on my system.
they were reclassified when the dod took possession of the suitcase nuke you disarmed.
then you're going to have to figure out a way to get them, 'cause without those schematics, I won't know what I'm looking for.
Yes, I understand, but I don't know how I can do this.
Chloe, Audrey's life is at stake.
think.
wait.
he had to file a report with dod about the work he did on the nukes.
it contained a revised schematic.
it might still be on his hard drive.
can you access it?
only directly from his terminal.
Chloe, please, do it.
where do you want me to send it?
to the cell phone that I'm calling you from.
use a secure line-- alpha-539.
hold on.
it's here.
the file's coming up.
I'm sending it to your screen.
stand by.
copy that.
come on.
Chloe, I don't see anything.
it needs to load before it sends.
there's still 30% to go. Damn it.
what?
Morris is coming back to his station.
hurry.
there's nothing I can do.
I need to log out now. He's here.
no, Chloe, wait.
I got it.
yes?
Mr. President, the vice president is here.
send him in.
please sit.
listen, I,uh...
I want to begin by expressing my gratitude to you.
for a lesson well learned.
I'm not sure what you mean by that, Mr. President.
I still believe attacking Abu Fayed's country with a nuclear weapon would have been a serious mistake, Noah; I'm not going lie to you about that.
but...
if you hadn't put that option on the table in the first place,
I never would've gone as far as I did.
and the bombs might still be out there.
that being said...
I think we would both agree that our relationship has always been a marriage of convenience.
a way to strengthen the ticket, rather than a case of us actually seeing eye to eye on pretty much anything.
and now that it's over, this crisis, it's become clear to me, Noah, that I just don't think it's possible for us to work together anymore.
excuse me?
I'm asking for your resignation.
how dare you.
you don't have the right to ask for my resignation.
this isn't about what the constitution says, Noah.
it's about what's best for this country in a time of crisis.
how in the world do you figure that?
I can't lead effectively with you undermining me at every single opportunity that you may get.
now let's be honest with each other.
that's exactly what you would do if you stayed in place.
Mr. President...
I refuse.
good night.
you don't want to walk out that door.
not like this.
otherwise I may have to make this extremely unpleasant for you.
now what are you talking about?
I'm talking about the recording that Tom Lennox has in his possession.
that's what I'm talking about.
conspiracy to commit perjury is a serious offense.
now I have to assume you'd rather resign, than spend the rest of your life living with that kind of humiliation.
so is resorting to blackmail your idea of effective leadership?
if there is anything I've learned anything from you, Noah, it would be that sometimes it's necessary to apply a little brute force.
I don't need your resignation immediately.
let's give the country a chance to take a breath after what happened today.
some time in the next week will be just fine, Mr. Vice president.
nest wants a flight path cleared to Edwards for 20 miles in each direction.
could you get back to me with confirmation?
thank you.
ETA on the helicopter that will transport the bombs is 15 minutes.
you should distribute protocols to the nest team.
I'm on that.
that's odd.
what?
I think someone's hacked into my system.
are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
ever since what happened to Nadia,
I installed a logging program to track any unauthorized access to my hard drive.
you did?
it's telling me that someone accessed my files ten minutes ago...
and downloaded the updated schematics to those suitcase nukes.
I'm calling security.
wait! Don't call security.
I'm the one who hacked into your system.
why would you do that?
I'll explain it to you in a little while.
explain it to me now.
I did it for Jack.
Audrey Raines is still alive.
the Chinese are holding her hostage.
what?
they're going to kill her unless Jack delivers an fb-sub-circuit board from one of the bombs to them.
you've been to all the same briefings.
the Russians have been trying to keep that technology out of Chinese hands for years.
I know.
well, what are the Russians going to say when they find out we just gave it to them?
it's not going to get that far.
how in the world do you know it's not going to get that far?
because Jack gave me his word.
I'm sorry, darling. I can't leave it at that.
Yes, you can.
the bombs that I reprogrammed for Fayed could have killed tens of thousands of people.
but that didn't happen.
I know what it felt like to think that I could've been responsible for each and everyone of their deaths.
I can't be involved with something that could easily end up starting a war.
it's not going to start a war because it's not going to get that far.
besides, this has nothing to do with you. I did it.
Yes, it does.
now that you've told me, it does.
you have to tell Buchanan.
I can'T.
then you're forcing me to.
no.
I'm going to do it.
No! Morris! - I'm doing it.
I'll tell him.
reinforcements aren't necessary at this point.
the military is guarding the bombs.
there's a CTU swat team standing by.
they'll be en route soon.
all right, thank you.
what is it, Chloe?
Mr. Buchanan...
I'm sorry, there's something that you need to know.
you two, come with me.
sir, this area's off-limits.
I'm agent Bauer.
I was the man that was responsible for securing these nukes.
I'm under a presidential order to remove the fb-circuit board from one of these bombs, have it transferred back to CTU for immediate analysis.
we don't have much time. This building has been compromised.
now open the gate.
sir, no one is allowed in here.
are you countermanding a presidential order?
how dare you, sergeant?!
now you're wasting my time.
what's your name?
what's your name?!
I want your name, too. Now!
that's not necessary.
open the gate. Open the gate!
I want both of you to stand guard while I remove the circuit board.
come on!
stand down, Jack!
I can't do that.
I won't say it again! - Drop it.
agent Doyle, I am following orders that exceed your security clearance!
he's a rogue agent.
take him out! - I will shoot!
put your weapon down or I will shoot you!
take him! Now!
secure him, he's under arrest.
Doyle, please. Just listen to me.
ll, we've got Jack.
what did he say? - Not much. I had to subdue him.
let me talk to him. - Hold on.
Buchanan wants to talk to you.
Jack, Chloe just told me about Audrey and the Chinese.
I can't let you give them the component.
I'm not going to.
I only need to have it long enough for them to let her go.
I was never going to let the Chinese keep it, Bill, I swear to you.
whatever you have planned, Jack, I can't let you do it.
bill, please...
right now we're the only chance she's got.
I understand what Audrey means to you.
I promise I will do everything in my power to get her back.
you didn't even know she was alive.
cheng is going to make it impossible for us to ever find her again.
we are her only hope and you know it.
I don't know what to tell you, Jack, except let Doyle bring you back here and we'll work out a game plan.
will you let me make one more call?
I'm asking you as a friend.
who do you want to talk to?
president Wayne Palmer.
I'll see if I can reach him.
let me talk to Doyle. - Yeah.
he wants to talk to you.
keep Jack in custody while I try to contact the president.
I'll route the call through your cell. - Yes, sir. I understand.
get him up.
white house sources have confirmed that terrorist leader Abu Fayed is dead.
the president has reportedly recovered from injuries sustained from the failed attempt on his life, and he is expected to make a statement shortly regarding unconfirmed rumors...
yes?
Mr. President, Bill Buchanan has Jack Bauer on the line.
put him through, please.
go ahead. - Please hold for the president.
it's the presidenT.
excuse me.
Mr. President. - Yes, Jack. Congratulations.
is everything still all right? - Yes, sir. The bombs are secure.
but I'm calling because I want you to authorize a field operation.
for what purpose? - To save Audrey Raines.
what? - Mr. President, she's still alive.
the Chinese have been holding her for the past few months.
now they're using her as a bargaining chip.
in exchange for what?
for an fb-sub-circuit board from one of the nukes.
they say they'll release Audrey unharmed if I bring it to them.
it's my understanding, Jack, that component holds the key to Russian defense codes.
Yes, sir, I'm aware of that.
I'm sympathetic, I am, and I promise you that I will make available to you the full resources of this country to get Audrey back, and I promise you that I will make available to you the full resources of this country to get Audrey back, but I hope you're not expecting me to authorize this exchange.
not exactly. - Then what exactly?
Mr. President, I need the Chinese to believe that I am willing to go through with this exchange.
I need to have that component on me. They're going to need to see it.
as soon as I know that Audrey is free, I will destroy it.
and how can you guarantee that?
I'm asking you to trust me, Mr. President.
I give you my word that that component will not end up in Chinese hands.
but if it does, the Russians, despite our peace accord, may take action against us for allowing it to happen.
now, under most circumstances, yes, your word would be sufficient, but in this case, Jack, I need to know details.
if I have to, I will destroy that circuit board with a concealed charge of c-4.
an explosion of c-4 would take out anything within 30 feet of it.
you're going to sacrifice yourself? - Yes, sir, if I have to.
Jack... - Mr. President, please.
please, I am begging you.
Audrey Raines was willing to give up her life to save mine.
I cannot and will not do anything less for her.
you're asking me to sign off on a probable suicide mission.
with all due respect, Mr. President, 16 hours ago, your people were willing to hand me over for dead, and I did not hesitate.
Mr. President, you owe me.
and you're sure this is the only way?
Yes.
all right, then.
I will not fail you, Mr. President.
I'll tell Bill to give you whatever you need.
now I'm going to need confirmation that circuit board has been destroyed after Audrey has been released.
I'll have CTU embed a tracking device in the board.
you'll have your confirmation.
good luck, Jack. - Thank you, Mr. President.
Yes, sir. - Let me speak with Bill Buchanan.
Yes, sir. I understand.
get over here.
what did he say?
Buchanan said the president signed off on this, and to give you whatever help you need.
I'm going to need someone to help me with Audrey's extraction during the exchange.
I want that to be you.
fine. Where are you going to be?
the name of the Chinese agent that's holding Audrey is Cheng Zhi
he was responsible for my interrogation and torture for almost two years in that chinese prison.
as soon as I get the signal from you that Audrey is safe, two things are going to happen.
I'm going to destroy that circuit board, and Cheng Zhi isn't going to make it out of here alive.
and Cheng Zhi sn't going to make it out of here alive.
so, in answer to your question, where am I going to be?
wherever I have to.
let's go.
are you going to tell me what happened?
the president agreed to Jack's plan.
the president's going to allow Jack to hand over a defense algorithm to the Chinese?
no. Of course not.
Jack will destroy the component as soon as he knows Audrey's safe.
the Chinese will never get it.
and how is he going to manage that?
I don't know. I guess president Palmer trusts him.
telling Buchanan was the right thing to do. You know it was.
it doesn't matter. You should have trusted me.
trusted you?
you're the one that broke into my system.
that's because I didn't think you'd back me up. Obviously, I was right.
so you're going to hold this over my head now, are you?
Yeah. For a long time.
for how long? Could you give me an estimate?
I'll get back to you.
Doyle's on line three.
they're going to lock you on the tracker frequency.
this is Nadia. - It's me. The tracker's on line.
the frequency marker is alpha-1793.
signal's good. You're on the grid. - Copy. Jack and I are getting ready to move out.
yes?
I have the circuit board. Where am I going?
get on the 180 and head north.
get off the first exit after mile marker 49.
I will give you further instructions when you've exited.
I got it.
you have a half an hour.
I don't think I need to remind you what would happen if you are late.
I understand.
CTU has the signal. They're monitoring the device.
I'm set. Let's go.
Jack, you're taking a hell of a risk.
if this goes sour, it could stir a firestorm. And for what?
if you were in my shoes, you wouldn't do the same thing?
I don't mix relationships with my job.
whatever you had with this woman, I hope it's worth it.
this isn't about what I had with a woman.
her name is Audrey Raines.
she served this country with honor. We owe her.
so get in the truck.
come in.
you wanted to see me?
close the door.
the president has just asked me to resign.
what?
and I'm going to comply with his request.
I wanted to tell you personally before you found out from someone else.
I don't understand.
why are you going along with this? Why don't you just tell him that you refuse?
he has a tape of our conversation.
the one where we conspire to commit perjury, and he's threatening to use it against me unless I step down.
Oh, my god.
Tom Lennox recorded it.
bottom line is,
I'm not being given a choice here.
this is all my fault.
if I hadn't asked you to lie about Karen Hayes, none of this would be happening.
you were just trying to protect me. I could have turned you down, but I didn'T.
don't blame yourself.
I'm so sorry.
I don't know what to say.
Aw, hell, at least we'll have a lot more time to spend together.
at least we'll have a lot more time to spend together.
the president said to take a week, but I want this...
etter of resignation in his hands by the time he finishes his press conference.
I am through being the loyal opposition.
please, sit.
first, I want to say that I'm grateful to report that Abu Fayed, the man responsible for these attacks, has been killed, and that all nuclear devices have been recovered.
I want to take the time to acknowledge the brave men and women in our various law enforcement agencies, and let us not forget our armed services.
all these people have worked so hard to bring this crisis to an end.
their dedication, their perseverance is without equal.
despite the brutality of these attacks, we did not allow the violence born of extremism to push us to extremes.
and, as Americans, we can and should take pride and comfort in that fact.
let me conclude by asking for your prayers tonight for all those who grieve this day.
for all those whose lives have been shattered.
let us reach out and begin the process of rebuilding.
let us reach out and begin the process of national healing.
thank you.
I'll take some of your questions now.
Yes. Ian.
Mr. President, how certain are you that the crisis is, in fact, over, and that there are no more of these weapons on American soil?
well, based on the intelligence that I've seen,
I can say with full confidence, Ian, that the worst has passed, and that the individuals responsible for these attacks have been apprehended, or else killed.
Yes, Andrea.
Robin, sir.
Robin, yes. Robin.
I'm sorry, it's been a, it's been a very long day.
please, go ahead.
Mr. President, there are several thousand muslim Americans still being held in detention facilities across the country.
what's going to happen to these people?
I've already directed homeland security to begin dismantling these detention facilities.
all detainees are to be released once the immediate crisis is passed.
excuse me.
um, now that the crisis has passed, we will be, um...
we will be reviewing the situation regarding individuals that we have in custody.
I'm sorry. I'm, not, uh,
I'm not being very clear.
uh, let me say again regarding your question, Andrea, that...Robin.
I'm sorry. Robin.
let me say again regarding...
regarding your question that the, uh...
the detention facilities that, that, that we will, uh...
we, we're going ...
Oh, my god. - Get medical right away!
code 4. Repeat, code 4.
we need an emergency medical team to the press room.
get these people out of here.
ladies and gentlemen, we need to clear this room.
please exit by the south door.
all signs indicate the president has suffered a cerebral hemorrhage brought on by injuries he sustained earlier in the day.
meaning he never should have been brought out of the coma.
however detrimental that decision was to his health,
I'm confident that in light of his actions today, he would continue to support it.
I'm glad you're so confident, Karen, since it was your reckless action that resulted in his stroke.
sir, it's unclear if the stroke was inevitable, but in any event, I'll take full responsibility.
excuse me.
now is not the time for recriminations, self-imposed or otherwise.
doctor, when will we know the extent of the damage and the prospects for recovery?
after the MRI.
the president is being prepped for transport to Bethesda as we speak.
based on my impressions, the damage was severe.
I don't think we can expect the president to regain consciousness anytime soon.
so it is incontestable Wayne Palmer won't be able to continue his duties as commander-in-chief.
there's no denying that this is a great tragedy for the nation and...
for those of us who know the president personally.
just...take care of him, doctor.
of course.
excuse me.
notify the senate and the house of the transfer of power and have the sec def and the chairman of the joint chiefs authorize me under the 25 amendment.
Yes, sir.
have the press secretary issue a statement.
president Palmer's been...
incapacitated.
no need for alarm.
executive authority's been transferred to me.
Our...hopes and prayers are with him.
all right, sir.
and I'll also need you available to review everything on the president's agenda.
all right, sir.
actually, there's something on the agenda I think you'll want immediate clarification on.
what's that?
Wayne Palmer just issued a finding allowing Jack Bauer to hand classified Russian technology over to the Chinese in exchange for the return of a covertly held hostage.
can you explain this?
Yes. That was a personal request from Jack Bauer to the president.
they have a longstanding relationship and as Jack Bauer was largely responsible for recovering the suitcase nukes today, the president wanted to honor his service to this country
Karen, I asked you to explain it, not excuse it.
understood.
Bauer has guaranteed that the technology will not fall into the hands of the Chinese.
it will only be used to secure the hostage.
incidentally, sir, the hostage in question is Audrey Raines, daughter of James Heller.
even Jack Bauer can't guarantee that outcome.
now, I am happy to honor agent Bauer's service to this country, but not at the risk of giving classified technology to the Chinese and...
potentially damaging our relationship with Russia in the process.
you tell CTU to stop Bauer-- immediately.
sir.
the president expressly...
that's all for now, Karen.
you, too, Tom.
unbelievable.
less than a minute behind his desk and he's already disregarding the president's wishes.
nevertheless, we both share Daniel's unease in handing military secrets over to the Chinese.
I know, Tom, but that is not the point.
no, here's the point.
Daniels is now the acting president, whether we like it or not.
I'm off to the hospital.
I'll see you there.
Buchanan.
Hi, it's me.
how's president Palmer?
not good.
the doctor says that he has a cerebral hemorrhage they don't know the extent of the damage, but obviously he's not able to serve.
Daniels is going to assume the office, and the first wave of his hand, he wants to stop Jack's operation.
Jack has to return to CTU as soon as possible with the component.
does the vice president understand the circumstances under which Wayne Palmer agreed to this?
no.
he's not that kind of a man.
he doesn't operate in shades of gray.
does he understand Jack's not gonna give up without a fight?
you just have to get Jack back to CTU as soon as possible, okay?
okay, I'll take care of it.
listen up.
the white house has ordered us to shut down Jack's operation.
how far away are support teams?
six miles.
have them standing by, ready to move in, contact CHP.
have them set up roadblocks.
Chloe, I want you to stand down on this operation.
Why?
you've shown me I can't trust you.
Morris, you cover comm.
Jack's not gonna go along with this.
I know.
Doyle.
Mike, it's Bill.
can Jack hear you? Say yes or no.
Yes.
there's been a change in profile.
Noah Daniels is acting president.
he wants the operation shut down and Jack brought back to CTU immediately.
understood.
what's your current location?
we're about two miles east of the 180 interchange.
okay, I need you to exit at the 70, make the first left.
we'll have roadblocks set up with a backup team ready to take Jack intcustody and recover the component.
all right, we'll do that.
you need to disarm Jack as soon as quickly and quietly as possible before he finds out.
no problem.
CTU's got a report from cal trans. The 180's closed due to high winds.
they're concerned about possible fallout.
they want us to take 70 instead.
fine.
don't you move.
Jack, what's the problem?
earlier today, I shot my old partner, a friend of mine, because he tried to stop me from doing what I have to do.
don't think for a second I won't do that to you.
slowly I want you to pull over.
now.
take the keys out of the ignition. Put them on the center console. And your phone.
Jack, you don't want to do this.
slowly get out of the truck.
back up towards the fence.
Jack, listen to me. Daniels is the acting president.
he's the one who called this off.
shut up and grab the fence!
this is gonna end badly, Jack.
you can't go against the white house!
you didn't just betray me. You betrayed your country.
I swear to you I didn't know.
but the russians know about the component.
and they're threatening military action against us if we don't get it back from the chinese.
you're going to go back to your boyfriend and you're going to make him believe that we have the component back.
when you go back to mr. Bishop you will find a way to excuse yourself from the room.
to allow him time to access your pda.
if you can feed all this convincingly to bishop, he will relay it to his russian contact, president suvarov will call off his threat of military action.
I'm always worried the next crisis is around the corner.
I think I know how to take your mind off of it.
head east, 153 meters.
that will put you directly beneath ctu.
this is nadia yassir, code red. It is confirmed, look this place down.
everyone on the floor!
you all right? -Yes, jack. What's going on?
what do they want with josh?
what do you mean josh?
they came here to get him.
I'm not leaving you. -Josh, you're not leaving anyo behind, we're gonna be following you. Just go through here. Go. Keep going.
put your weapon down on the ground. Now!
I'm putting the weapon down.
the boy's escaped. -Get the boy back.
I don't care what you have to do.
Josh, I'm going to give you ten seconds.
if you don't show yourself by the time I finish counting, she dies.
the operation was successful, my men have your grandson.
call me when i can talk to the boy.
have you finished repairing the sub-circut board? -Almost.
I'll return it when you bring me my grandson.
who's in command?
I am. Milo pressman.
I'm acting director of ctu.
the following takes place between 3: 00 am and 4: 00 am.
cheng, I'm sending the boy to you now.
get him into the tunnel, now.
Josh! Josh! Josh. No! Josh.
stop it. What are you gonna do, what do you...
No! -Marilyn. Marilyn!
what do you want with him?
please, let me...they're taking my child. Please!
leave her alone!
he's just a boy. He'S...he's just a boy...
shut up! -Wait! Please!
I can help you calm her down.
please, let me just help you.
get on your feet!
keep her quiet! -Thank you. Thank you.
all of you, listen to me. Pay attention.
we're moving you to a secure room then we will leave.
do what I tell you to do and no one will be hurt.
come on.
we're moving you in two groups. Group one, on your feeT.
what are they doing?
they got what they want.
now they want to stop us from being able to follow them.
we're going to try to get josh back.
Marilyn, I need you to be at the front of our group. Do you understand me?
you need to be in the front of our group.
group two, on your feet!
OK, stand up.
Marilyn, go.
Nadia. If cheng's men lock us in the holding room, we're gonna lose our only chance to get that component back.
so we have to do something now. -Yeah.
but you need to understand, it's a long shot at best...
there's a good chance we won't make it through this.
I understand.
stay close to me.
as soon as I make my move take the first man on the left.
okay. -What are you guys talking about?
Chloe, keep going.
Morris, stay alert.
are you all right? -Yeah.
teams b and c, do we have the hostages secured? -Yes, sir. All secure.
they were cheng's men that attacked us. -They were after my nephew.
I don't know why, but it has to do something with the component, otherwise why would they take the risk?
all I need is a tactical set up and comm and I'm ready to go.
you're still under arrest, jack. -Nadia, please.
I know the schematics of this building better than anyone, I can find them.
okay, I'll release you, jack, but doyle's in command. -Fine.
give him whatever he needs. -yes
how many casualties did you sustain?
one.
are you okay? -No.
I'm set, we need to go.
use my cell until comm's up.
you did great.
move, let's go.
that was really brave.
I need to restore comm and satellite immediately.
there may be more server capacity in data storage.
try it.
keep climb up. Let's go.
Hello, josh. -Who are you?
start loading, we're moving out.
what do you want from me?
what took so long? I've been waiting for your call.
I have the boy with me. -Put him on the phone.
your grandfather wants to speak with you.
my grandfather? -Yes.
take the phone.
grandpa?
Hello, joshua.
look...I'm sorry, i know you've been through a lot.
I'm sorry?
a few hours ago you pointed a gun at my head and said you'd kill me.
I never would have hurt you. -I heard you say it!
I had to make it sound convincing... to you and to jack.
otherwise I wouldn't have gotten away.
but I wouldn't hurt you. Not for anything.
this way.
what do you want from me? -To protect you.
from what?
from your father's mistakes.
if you stay here...
they'll never let you forget what your father did.
I'm taking you away from this ungrateful country.
some place we can both start over. -Where?
china.
within a decade, they will have surpassed this country in every possible way.
and we can be part of it, josh.
I am going to give you the future I promised you when you were born.
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
no, I didn't think you would.
but you will.
I'll explain everything when I see you.
right now, all i need is for you to keep an open mind.
let's go.
no, wait, please! I don't want to be with my grandpa.
I'm afraid of him. -Your grandfather's a visionary
you should be grateful for the opportunity.
I don't want to be with him, though!
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
cheng's using the boy as a shield-- hold your fire! Hold your fire!
I've got two hostiles at the suv! Cover me now!
go, go, go, go! move!
this is bauer. I've got one hostile down. We're moving towards the roof.
go! Go! Go!
cheng, it's over!
put your weapon down! Now!
put it down!
where is the boy?!
tell me where the boy is, and I won't kill you.
help! - Josh!
help! - Josh...
help -Hold on
Josh...here, you need to grab my arm.
do it now. Now! Now!
you okay? - Yeah.
Mike, it's jack. I'm on the roof.
I lost cheng, but I've got josh.
I need to secure him.
on our way up now.
we're setting up a perimeter around the building.
Josh, the man who had you, his name was cheng.
did he explain why he tried to take you?
no, but he made me talk on the phone with grandpa.
he did?
you talked to your grandfather? - Yeah.
What'd he say?
he said that he loved me, that he wanted to take me to china and that I was his legacy.
I think he's out of his mind.
Josh, listen to me, I need your help.
was there anything that you might have heard that could help us figure out where your grandfather is?
no. - Josh, think.
I don't know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry...
Josh, no. Hey, hey, it's all right.
it's all right.
come on, let's get you back to your mom.
CTU has a team on the way to secure the area.
you need to let them know my father's still involved in this.
your father's involved with the chinese? Why?
I don't know. I'll ask him when I find him.
sir? - Come in, karen.
I just got off the phone with the pentagon, and the latest intel indicates that the russians are moving another two mechanized divisions into the central asian theater.
are they within striki distance of our base? - Yes.
and the troops are at the highest level of alert.
sir, tom lennox was supposed to be on the call with me, and I couldn't find him or get him on the telephone.
is there something that I should know about?
Tom is out in the field running a classified operation.
he figured out who the leak was.
who? - Lisa miller - Lisa miller is spying for the russians? - No.
the man lisa is romantically involved with is.
for the last year, this man, mark bishop's been passing lisa's e-mails along to the russians, along with other things that...
she told him in confidence.
and that's how the russians knew the chinese had the component.
does lisa know? - She does now.
Tom sent her back to this man, bishop, with a cover story and falsified e-mails that we hope will convince the russians that we've destroyed the circuit board before the chinese could get it out of the country, and with any luck, bishop'll forward those e-mails to the russians and they'll back off.
and we'll have bought time to actually retrieve the...
component from the chinese.
well, I hope that works, sir.
Karen. Sit down.
I know you're wondering why you've been kept out of the loop on this, so let me assure you it had nothing to do with you and everything to do with me.
I don'T...I don't understand.
at the same time lisa was...
with bishop, she and I were...
in a relationship as well.
needless to say...
I am ashamed.
Well...sir, I...
I think you're being a little hard on yourself.
you and lisa were both single, and...
there's no way you could know what she was doing behind your back.
it's a question of judgment.
I trusted her.
and unless tom's plan succeeds...
that mistake will bring us to war.
and finally we're done. Here we go.
you okay?
I'm great. That was great.
it felt like you were somewhere else.
I'm just tired.
it's been a long day.
I'll be right back.
do you think he's just concerned or...suspicious?
Yeah, I don't know.
but she is leaving him alone with the pda.
this could be it.
he's making his move, he's making his move.
is that excellent?
that must be the device he's using to forward the e-mails to the russians.
GentlemeN...he is taking the bait.
come on. Come on. There you go.
come on, come on, come on. Send these e-mails. Come on.
he's not going to, sir.
he's putting her pda away.
sweetheart, I'm just gonna pour myself a glass of wine.
you want something? - Sure. I'll have what you're having.
you know, I don't think it's just that you're tired.
what are you talking about?
I can tell from the way you were in bed that something's wrong.
all right, we have a problem here.
I told you everything's fine.
then why can't you look me in the eye?
because you're making me nervous staring at me like that?
can we stop talking about this?
mark... - I know you.
you don't get nervous. - Stop it. You're hurting me.
what's going on?! - Nothing's going on!
you're lying! - I'm not lying!
tell me what's going on!
all right, this is not good.
all right, I'll tell you what's going on.
what's going on you're a lying son of a bitch! - We got to get in there quick! Come on!
I put myself on the line for you and all you were doing was whoring yourself to the russians, stealing my e-mail, you bastard!
bitch!
they're gonna charge me with treason! I'll be put in jail!
who knows about me and the russians?! Who knows?!
Freeze! Get him off her!
put Mr. Bishop in the bedroom.
she's got a pulse. It's faint.
she's breathing.
all right, let's get an ambulance here fast.
Mr. Bishop, I'm tom lennox.
I would guess you've already familiarized yourself with the white house staff.
if I could have a moment alone with the prisoner?
Mr. Bishop, we have incontrovertible evidence you were spying for the russians.
we have recordings of you on the phone with the agent running you, and now, of course, we've got this.
do I have your attention?
all right. So here it is.
you are going to upload the e-mails on Ms. Miller's pda to your russian employers.
additionally, you are going to call your handler and back up the story these e-mails tell namely, that our country destroyed the circuit board before it could fall into chinese hands.
now, if you comply, we'll push for leniency in your sentencing.
if you do not, I can all but guarantee you the death penalty.
what is it, cheng? - I lost the boy.
who has him? - Ctu and your son.
this is totally unacceptable.
the boy was my price for repairing the circuit board.
I lost many men trying to give you your price, Mr. Bauer!
I really don't give a damn about your operational incapacities.
our arrangement is over. - It cannot be over.
you have our component.
you failed to hold up your end of the deal.
the circuit board is no longer yours.
you repair the circuit board and return it to us or there'll be serious consequences!
now you listen to me.
I'm not afraid of you, cheng.
and the next time you threaten me, the consequences will be serious but not for me.
any luck?
Chloe, have our teams been able to locate cheng or the sub-circuit board?
no, nothing yet.
what's the status on our satellite?
we managed to reroute circuits through an undamaged subsystem.
we should have the gd back up in ten minutes.
try to make it five.
Nadia yassir?
Yeah, can I help you?
my name is ben kram, I'm from division.
you should have received a flash memo alerting you of my arrival.
well, our systems are still down so we can't receive memos just yet.
that's exactly why I'm here.
I've been authorized to compile an accounting and assessment of your security breach.
well, sir, we're right in the middle of a recovery operation and it's 3: 00 in the morning.
I mean, this isn't the best time to be questioning my people.
frankly, Ms. Yassir, I don't particularly care what you think.
excuse me?
this incident represents a serious breach in your security protocols, one which resulted in a loss of ctu personnel.
obviously, mistakes were made; errors in judgment.
not the least of which was my accepting bill buchanan's recommendation to leave someone with your limited experience in charge.
so, can I, uh, count on your full cooperation or not?
I never said otherwise.
super.
I'll need a full staff roster and access to all departments plus some kind of a station to set up my investigation.
you can work out of that conference room over there.
thank you.
Yeah, this is nadia yassir.
there is a group from division here in conference room "B."
please give them whatever it is that they need.
Yeah, morris?
this may not be my place, don't let those buggers from division get to you.
you're not responsible for what happened.
of course I'm responsible.
it happened on my watch.
there's nothing you could have done.
do not let them hang you out to dry.
no, morris, people are dead.
Milo is dead because of me.
that's ridiculous.
there's nothing anyone could have done, darling.
no, I...I could have stood up.
I could have said something.
there was no time.
Milo jumped in.
there was time.
I just hesitated.
I was just...
you were just afraid?
Yeah, I have a bit of experience with that.
look, I'm not one to give advice on how to handle self-recrimination, but I know this: Milo was a brave man.
he never would have sacrificed himself if he knew you could allow others to lay his death at your feet.
he'd want you to stay strong, stay in charge.
sir, tom lennox is on the line for you.
Thanks.
Tom, I'm here with karen.
Yes, sir, that information we planted for the russians, that has been sent on to bishop's contact.
good.
do you think it's made its way to suvarov yet?
I'm confident it has, sir.
but I do think a call to the russian president giving him the news ourselves, that might well strengthen the credibility of our story here.
I agree.
Tom, thanks.
uh, sir, there is one other thing.
what's that?
we had some complications, and, uh, lisa was injured in the operation.
how badly?
well, she experienced a loss of oxygen to the brain.
won't know the extent of the damage till she regains consciousness.
she is on her way to the hospital.
how the hell did this happen?
sir, she attacked bishop suddenly before we could even get in there.
he almost strangled her to death.
and what were you doing during all this?
you were supposed to be watching her the whole time!
where was secret service?
sir, we did everything we could.
it just happened too fast.
all right, thank you, tom.
all right, I'll be back there shortly.
I'm so sorry, sir.
I know that despite her betrayal, you still have feelings for lisa.
unfortunately, we do have a pressing matter to address.
Yes, sir, we've got to call him immediately and tell him that the chinese no longer have the component and that it has been destroyed.
set it up in the telepresence suite.
right away, sir.
I'm gonna get you back to your mom soon, okay?
just sit here.
I'll be right back.
CTU - This is jack.
patch me through to marilyn bauer's cell phone. - Yes, sir.
Jack, ground teams have done a thorough search of the area and cheng's vehicles.
the sub circuit board's not here.
what about aerial surveillance?
the choppers have picked up nothing and we just now got satellite back online.
it looks like cheng got out.
there's nothing more we can do here.
get your men ready. We'll go back to ctu. - got it - Hello? - Hey, it's me.
did they tell you josh was safe?
Yeah, but that's all they'll tell me.
what's going on?
when can I see him?
we should be back at ctu in the next few minutes.
Marilyn, the chinese were doing this for my father.
they were trying to get josh to him.
are you sure?
Yeah, josh spoke to him.
what did he tell josh?
he said he wanted to take him back to china, that josh was his legacy.
that's it? That's all he said?
Yeah.
can I talk to him?
of course. Hold on one second.
Hey, it's your mom.
mom. - Hey!
Hey, are you okay?
did they hurt you?
no, I'm all right.
I don't know what i would do if I lost you.
mom, uncle jack, he saved my life.
I know.
I love you so much.
I love you, too, mom.
I'll see you soon, all right?
okay, honey.
you okay?
come on. We need to go.
sir, president suvarov is standing by for you.
whenever you're ready.
let's do this.
president suvarov, you have a secure conference with vice president daniels.
Mr. President, I have some good news to share with you.
and what is this good news, Mr. Vice president?
we were successful in locating and taking out the chinese agents who were attempting to smuggle the fb sub-circuit board out of the country.
are you saying you have the component back in your possession?
no, sir.
the sub-circuit board was destroyed when we attacked the chinese.
I see.
I assume you have proof of this?
Yes, we do.
in addition to fragments from the destroyed component,
I'm prepared to give you whatever images or documentation you need to assure that this threat's been neutralized.
do you mean the same documentation you planted with one of my agents?
excuse me?
the same images you coerced him into sending to my people of a strike that accomplished nothing but destroying an empty building?
Yes, I know you exposed one of my operatives.
I had him under surveillance, which is how I know about your raid on his apartment.
Mr. President...
now, if the chinese agent in possession of the sub-circuit board is allowed to transfer it to his government, the entire russian defense system will be compromised.
I told you I would hold you and your government responsible.
I will not tolerate any threats from you, Mr. President.
we're doing everything in our power to ensure this component does not reach china.
I have already given you ample time to recover it.
now I am feeling less generous.
if you do not deliver complete and irrefutable proof to our embassy that you have recovered or destroyed this component within two hours,
I will have no choice but to extend my country's forward perimeter to compensate for our defensive vulnerabilities.
you are talking about attacking one of our military bases.
now I would urge you to consider the consequences of that.
we have just as many troops in that area and allies who will not look kindly upon any unprovoked aggression on my country.
you and I both know it will not be unprovoked.
this is a matter of survival for us.
it is in both our interests that you get that component back.
you have two hours.
it was all for nothing.
excuse me, sir?
this ruse, it bought us nothing.
we're about to go to war over a piece of circuitry.
this is the agenda for the vice president's briefing with the military.
okay. When did they start?
a few minutes ago.
they're in the oval office.
all right, I'll play catch up.
Tom lennox.
who?
all right, put him through.
the russians are blaming us for allowing the chinese theft of the fb sub-circuit board and they're preparing to retaliate against us.
all our efforts to reacquire the component have failed, so we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
and to make provisions for the escalation of this conflict beyond the central asian theater.
excuse me, Mr. Vice president.
I'm glad you could make it, tom.
general kram is about to run some response scenarios.
before we do that, sir, I need a moment alone with you and karen.
excuse us, ladies and gentlemen.
I've got phillip bauer calling for you on a scrambled line.
what? What does he want?
I don't know.
but he's in league with the chinese.
I think we need to hear him out.
put him on speaker.
Mr. Bauer.
thank you for taking my call, Mr. Vice president.
what's this about?
I think you know what this is about.
tell me anyway so there's no miscommunication.
I want my grandson.
and I want clear passage to the country of my choice.
you give me that, and I'll give you the fb sub-circuit board.
you're working with the chinese?
I was.
they had their chance, they blew it.
how do I know you even have this component?
serial number 3ptl3.
check it against any records you have.
and there it is, sir.
you realize what you're asking?
I'm offering you the opportunity of avoiding a conflict this country does not want, a war this country cannot afford.
not after what's happened today.
I'll send my instructions on an encrypted data stream.
Mr. Bauer...
sir, you're not seriously considering this?
Phillip bauer is a federal fugitive...
complicit in selling nuclear weapons to terrorists.
I know what crimes he's committed.
then how can you even entertain the thought of negotiating with him?
because it may be we can't afford not to.
we are talking about trading the life of an innocent young boy.
we're talking about the lives of a lot more young men if we go to war with russia.
and you think phillip bauer is somebody that we can trust?
the man is a sociopath.
he is a sociopatH.
she's right about that.
but given the stakes, this is a risk worth taking, sir.
none of this makes sense.
everything we know about suvarov tells us the man wouldn't risk military engagement, even for this piece of technology.
unless he's being squeezed.
who by?
his cabinet?
no. The military.
Gredenko was not the only anti-american general left over from the soviet regime.
Yes, some of them are still in power, and suvarov does rely on them.
so you think these generals are just looking for an excuse to pull the trigger.
well, certainly sounds plausible, sir.
well, if that is the case, then we have no choice.
we have to recover that stolen circuit board.
get me ctu.
as soon as we get back to ctu, you and your mother will be transported to a safe location.
how long will we be there?
until we find your grandfather.
uncle jack, when you find him, what are you going to do to him?
Josh, I don't want you worrying about this.
but I promise you, he will never threaten you or your mother again.
agent bauer!
call for you. It's urgent.
Josh, get in the car I'll be right there.
Josh, you need to come with me.
what do you mean?
come now!
uncle jack!
agent doyle!
uncle jack!
agent doyle!
orders jack!
go back to ctu!
the boy stays with me!
get out of my way.
take him dowN.
what are you doing?!
uncle jack!
take him to ctu!
uncle jack!
uh, one more minute.
that's what you said five minutes ago. Now, put it away.
dad...
I got you the phone for emergencies, honey.
well, this is an emergency.
fine.
wait, now, how come you get to talk on the phone? That's not fair.
life's not fair. Hello.
Hello? Who is this?
Emily? Are you okay?
go! Move!
everybody...
dad... dad... Dad... dad! Dad!
Emily! - Dad! Dad!
Emily! - Dad!
go! Get in there!
daddy! - Let's go!
please don't hurt my daughter.
I've got money.
we don't want your money, Mr. Latham.
we just need you to fix something for us.
let the record show this is the third day of this senate hearing investigating human rights violations by the recently disbanded counter terrorist unit.
yesterday, when we adjourned, we were discussing brutality and torture by CTU agents in the course of their operations.
will the witness please state his name?
Mr. Bauer, I don't see your counsel present.
is he or she not aware that we're about to start?
I have chosen not to retain counsel.
Mr. Bauer, I have to advise you that many of the questions that we' about to pose to you are of a legal nature and might result in answers that could incriminate you.
I understand that, senator.
we can postpone your testimony until this afternoon if you'd like to bring in representation something that I would strongly advise.
what is the first question, senator?
all right, then. Let's begin.
Mr. Bauer, who is Iibrahim Hadad?
that information is classified.
we represent the people of the United States, and we have declassified those files on their behalf.
now, I'm going to ask you one more time: Who is Ibrahim Hadad?
he was a member of a terrorist sleeper cell CTU had under surveillance in 2002.
and isn't it true that you detained Mr. Hadad without due process, and that you used extreme interrogation methods on him until he answered your questions?
Yes, sir.
would you say that you broke procedure with this interrogation?
probably. - Probably?
well, that's a... very cavalier answer.
you don't seem to care about the implications here.
well, Mr. Bauer?
I'm sorry, senator. I didn't hear a question.
all right, then.
did you torture Mr. Hadad?
according to the definitions set forth by the Geneva Convention, yes, I did.
senator, why don't I save you some time.
it's obvious that your agenda is to discredit CTU and generate a series of indictments.
my only agenda is to get to the truth.
I don't think it is, sir.
excuse me?
ibrahim Hadad had targeted a bus carrying 45 people, ten of which were children.
the truth, senator, is I stopped that attack from happening.
by torturing Mr. Hadad.
by doing what I deemed necessary to protect innocent lives.
so, basically, what you're saying, Mr. Bauer, is that the ends justify the means, and that you are above the law.
when I am activated, when I am brought into a situation, there is a reason.
and that reason is to complete the objectives of my mission at all costs.
even if it means breaking the law?
for a combat soldier, the difference between success and failure is your ability to adapt to your enemy.
the people that I deal with-- they don't care about your rules.
all they care about is a result.
my job is to stop them from accomplishing their objectives.
I simply adapted.
in answer to your question, am I above the law? No, sir.
I am more than willing to be judged by the people you claim to represent.
I will let them decide what price I should pay.
but please do not sit there with that smug look on your face and expect me to regret the decisions that I have made, because, sir, the truth is, I don't.
excuse me, sir.
sorry for interrupting, senator. I'm Renee Walker with the FBI.
we have a subpoena for Jack Bauer.
I need him remanded into my custody immediately.
I'm not surprised that anyone has a subpoena for Mr. Bauer, but right now, you're going to have to wait your turn.
he's being questioned by the United States senate.
sir, we need Mr. Bauer immediately.
well, apparently, we're going to have to let you go for W, but we're not done with you.
we'll reconvene with you tomorrow morning at the same time. Is that understood?
Yes, sir.
all right. Then you go along with these agents.
well, let's proceed.
bailiff, call the next witness.
what is this about?
Mr. Bauer, I'm special Agent Walker. This is agent Teller.
we need you to come with us to our office.
it's just down the block. - Why?
you'll be briefed when we get there.
Hello? - Janis, it's me. Where's Larry?
he's briefing Dornan's group.
tell him I've got Bauer, we're leaving the hearing now.
well, that's good, 'cause the situation's heating up.
what are you talking about?
that crew we've been tracking?
they just grabbed a man named Michael Latham.
Latham? He worked on homeland's firewall project.
Oh, he didn't just work on it, he designed it.
he's the chief engineer of the government's infrastructure security system.
all right, I'll be there soon.
did you get Bauer cleared through security yet?
not yet.
well, Renee's bringing him in. They're only a couple minutes out.
then you won't need him cleared for a couple of minutes.
Sean, as a friend, I'd like to keep... - you're not my friend.
sure.
as someone as close to a friend as you are ever going to get, let me give you some advice.
most people don't like sarcasm.
I myself have no problem with it, 'cause I'm cheerful.
I'm a cheerful person.
you're a cheerful person?
just get Bauer cleared.
for the past eight weeks, this office has been investigating a series of technology thefts
software, custom gate array chips, neural networks.
forensics concluded that the break-ins were the work of the same crew, but we didn't know what their end game was until now.
this is Michael Latham.
he's chief engineer on the classified infrastructure portal, homeland's firewall project.
he was abducted ten minutes ago by the same group behind the technology thefts.
you think they're using this guy Latham to get through the CIP firewall?
that's our concern.
the hardware they stole could be used to build a device to do just that.
and Latham's one of the few people that could do it.
we assume he's being forced to work on the device, or that he's already dead.
excuse me-- Renee's on her way in with Jack Bauer.
thank you.
we've tasked your people to help this investigation. See Sean. He's got the packets.
we're on it.
we're on line with GSA 117.
how many systems?
communications, navigation...
but we need the other systems working. Check on Latham.
all right... it's done.
northeast three, this is Global Skies 117.
we are ready for clearance.
GSA 117, roger.
you're clear to JFK airport as filed.
maintain 5, 000.
expect flight level of 280 ten minutes after departure.
cleared to JFK. Expect flight level 280.
welcome to global skies flight number 117, passenger service from Reagan-National to JFK.
weather in New York is cloudy with a chance of thunder showers, so we may run into some turbulence along the way.
tower to skies, awaiting traffic off of Dulles.
position hold, GSA 117.
GSA 117, that's correct.
Mr. Bauer?
I'm agent Larry Moss. I'm the head of this office.
you're here because agent walker thinks you might be able to help us with an investigation.
now, personally, I have my doubts, but I'll be happy to be proven wrong.
well, CKY for me, I'm not here to apply for a job, agent Moss.
personally, I don't care what makes you happy, so let's just get this over with.
take him to Renee's office.
do you want me in the room with you?
no. - Renee...
you've read his file.
Bauer's the kind of guy you say the wrong thing, he can go off.
I'll be fine, Larry.
if he goes off, I'll call you.
all right, but if he doesn't produce, don't waste our time. Throw him back.
what do you want?
Mr. Bauer, we have a national security matter that has gone critical.
I'm hoping you can help us with it.
please sit down.
I sent the differentials to homeland.
was there anything else you needed me to do?
no.
has Bauer been indicted yet?
no, but he will be after the Senate Hearings.
the CPI firewall protects every major infrastructure system in this country
if it were breached, telecommunication, transportation, power grids,they would all be vulnerable.
agent Walker, right? - Yes.
I'm not active.
the DOJ is about to file criminal charges against me;
I'm not exactly in a position to help you with your situation.
as much as I understand how dire it is...
no, I don't think you do.
one of the men behind this threat...is someone you know.
that's not possible.
Tony Almeida is dead.
apparently not. - I was there when he died.
and he was rushed away by the EMTs a minute later.
you never saw him after that, and hours later you were abducted by the Chinese government.
no. No.
if Tony were still alive, I would know. He would have contacted me.
we recovered this image from a security camera where one of the technology thefts took place.
it's time-stamped and dated.
images can be manipulated.
not this one.
I'm sorry, I don't believe it.
I had Almeida's grave exhumed.
DNA tests confirmed that it was not his body that was buried.
the evidence is right here.
if you want to leave without looking at it, go ahead.
GSA 117 on a roll.
Yes, sir.
are we in their system?
Yes.
Roger tower, GSA 117, switching to departure 126. 8
have a good day.
what's the problem?
the CPI module-- it stopped working.
what do you mean it stopped?
it keeps going out of phase.
I thought Latham said it was good to go.
well, it's not.
all right, let me have it.
so what did you do?
I didn't do anything.
I swear.
then why isn't it working?
I don't know.
fix it.
now.
you're gonna want to move faster than that.
See,'cause if you can't make this work in the next few minutes, I won't need you anymore.
you understand what that means?
good.
now fix it.
officials say that an estimated 300, 000 civilians-- men, women, and children have been killed as part of general Benjamin Juma's campaign of ethnic cleansing.
survivors in the African nation of Sangala, believe American intervention is necessary to prevent further bloodshed.
the White House has made no public statements...
Juma's perpetrating the worst mass murder Africa has seen since Lwanda.
but if you read the columns...
I do.
half of them are against our taking action.
but if we don't...
six months from now, those same members of the press will be accusing us of moral bankruptcy.
we can always revisit the UN option.
the UN's paralyzed, Ethan, while people are being butchered by that madman.
we have to lead.
even if it means going it alone.
I'm not gonna have hundreds of thousands of lives on my conscience.
general Juma has to be stopped.
he will be, madame president.
as soon as you give the order.
are the joint chiefs here yet?
they're gathering in the situation room.
they'll call as soon as they're ready for you.
I just heard Kevin Aldrich is doing a piece for CNB.
he's still pressing his case against sending our troops in.
as if getting through this day won't be hard enough.
if you want, I can sit down with him and try to get him to hold off; he's in the press room.
I'm not sure that's a good idea, Henry.
this is the last thing you need right now, especially with public opinion so split.
if you think you can talk Aldrich down, do it.
Madame president, the joint chiefs are ready.
here's your briefing package.
wish me luck.
good luck.
is this everything?
it's all there.
I don't mean to sound like a broken record, but I'm not sure your husband is up to handling Aldrich.
Henry's fine.
he's better, I realize that, but...
it's going to take more than a few months.
he lost a son.
so did you.
and you haven't let your loss interfere with your job.
your husband is a strong man, but he doesn't have your resilience.
it's not a matter of resilience, Ethan.
there's not a day that goes by, not a moment when I don't think about my son.
but I'm about to take this nation to war and grief is a luxury I can't afford right now.
before we begin, let me thank each of you for the time and work you've put into this operation.
putting American lives at risk is the hardest decision I've ever had to make...
but it is one that has to be made.
what was that?
it's working.
what was wrong?
it was overheating. I came up with a workaround.
try it now.
there.
Yeah.
it's transmitting again.
we can send and receive.
double a-123 maintain course.
what was that?
I just got it, too.
did you guys lose synch?
Yeah. I did, but we're back up now.
anybody else lose synch?
no, I'm good.
no, I'm fine.
what's going on, Phil?
this is gonna sound crazy, but the three of us just got bumped for a second.
but the log file doesn't show a power surge.
this came from the system kernel.
what are you talking about?
the kernel's protected.
let me have a look.
all we know for sure is that Almeida is part of a homegrown terrorist group that's targeting our infrastructure.
he could be working undercover, some kind of sting operation.
you need to check every Federal Agency
we have. State and city, too.
Almeida's not working for any of them.
then there must be some other explanation.
Yeah, there is.
his wife was brutally murdered by a faction operating inside the government, led by the president himself.
everybody involved in that is either in prison or has been killed.
the government gave president Logan a slap on the wrist, they cut him a deal.
sentencing him to house arrest on a hundred-acre ranch...
and you think Tony's looking for justice by attacking this country?
Almeida lost everything he had, and he's blaming it on the government he spent his life serving.
but you'd know better than me how that feels...
how far a man might go.
not that far.
and not Tony Almeida.
there's a logical explanation for this.
it's just something you're not seeing.
help me find Almeida and you can ask him yourself.
you know how he thinks.
you had the same training.
you know the same people.
I'm going to need complete access to all of your source material
everything you've got on this.
yes?
Renee, come out here. Something just came in.
be right there.
everything we have on Almeida's crew is in this directory.
start here...
I'll be right back.
what's going on?
northeast air traffic control just called.
they reported a possible intrusion into their communication systems.
it just happened.
can they source them?
they're trying, but so far, nothing.
why do we think this has to do with Almeida's crew?
I don't think you get intrusions like this unless someone's driving it, and the only way to drive it is through the CPI firewall.
so they're going after air traffic control.
that's what it looks like.
put me through to the White House.
you doing a turnaround in New York?
Nope. Got two days off.
I'm meeting my boyfriend in the city.
Oh, that'll be fun.
well, Doug said we were going to hit some weather.
I'm going to need tech support to cross-reference your files.
you'll be working with one of my analysts, Sean Hillinger.
he can get you whatever files you need to help us find Almeida.
good.
they raise the threat level yet?
Yeah. We think Almeida's gup got into air traffic control.
what?
that doesn't make sense.
I don't need you to figure it out, Jack.
just help me find him.
Sean, this is Jack Bauer.
he's going to be working with the Almeida files.
give him whatever he needs.
what about interfacing with FAA?
Janis is working with some of Dornan's people on that.
you just help Jack.
fine.
I'll check in.
Thanks.
what do you want to see?
let's start with the technology thefts.
how many were there?
six.
let's run a comp on all of them.
fantastic.
the expeditionary strike force and its carrier air wing are now on scene.
this gives us full spectrum dominance of the battle space.
what kind of resistance are you anticipating from Juma's military?
minimal.
our air strikes will take out whatever defenses they've got.
we can expect an open path to Juma's front door.
good.
all we need to launch is a go order from you.
you'll get a green light as soon as I've gone over secretary Stevens' post-invasion report, which I'm still waiting for.
I'll have it for you in a few minutes, ma'am.
unless there's a problem you'd like to discuss.
Madame president, my objection to this operation isn't a secret to anyone in this room.
for us to be wading into the middle of another civil conflict halfway around the world...
we're done debating this, Joe.
the UN's been issuing reprimands and economic sanctions while Benjamin Juma has slaughtered over 200, 000 of his own people.
that number will continue to grow if we don't stop him now.
and if you can't get behind what we're doing, I'll find a secretary of state who can.
but I am done with your hand-wringing.
excuse me, madame president.
tim woods from homeland security is outside.
he needs to see you on another matter.
can it wait?
no, ma'am, it can't.
all right.
we'll continue when I return.
and, Joe, I want that report in front of me when I get back.
what is it?
I don't have the details, but it involves a potential domestic breach.
tim is here to fill us in.
Madame president.
Tim, make this brief; the joint chiefs are waiting.
we've been working with the FBI the last eight weeks, investigating a series of technology thefts.
we didn't understand the implications of this until today.
the same people behind these thefts abducted a man named Michael Latham.
he's one of the chief engineers in charge of protecting critical infrastructure.
now, tell me what we're dealing with.
the FBI thinks these same people have forced Latham to create a device to hack through the CIP firewall.
the firewall protects all national systems: Energy, utilities, transportation...
I'm here because the FAA reported some irregularities in their air traffic control system.
are you saying commercial flights are in danger?
possibly.
do I need to give the order to ground air traffic?
I'm afraid it's not that simple.
right now, there are more than 3, 000 flights over the continental United States.
to ground them all would take 12 hours, minimum, and it could create a panic.
then what do you recommend?
let us quietly decrease air traffic while the bureau works their leads.
we'll make sure you're briefed on a real-time basis.
I don't like the timing of this...
timing?
could this be connected to our intervention in Sangala?
the FBI hasn't found any connection.
all the evidence suggests that we're dealing with a domestic terror group, homegrown, with a strong, anti-government bias.
and these leads you mentioned
do you think you'll be able to catch these people before they do any real damage?
the bureau's got everyone on it, ma'am.
you didn't answer my question.
no, ma'am. I didn't.
of course, I don't condone what Juma's doing over there.
but tribal wars are being fought all over the world.
why not intervene in Thailand, Malaysia?
this isn't a tribal war, Kevin.
it's a genocide.
ending it is the moral obligation of a nation as powerful as ours.
that's a lofty aspiration, but the reality is a lot more complex.
the president's going into this with both eyes open.
how can she be sure the cycle of violence won't continue after Juma's been taken out?
could be stuck there indefinitely...keeping the peace.
if I gave you an exclusive preview of the president's post-invasion plans, you might change your mind.
you're trying to bribe me with an exclusive?
I'm trying to get you to give us some rope.
what are you asking me to do, stop writing or write what I don't believe?
either one would be fine with me.
sir, you have a phone call on your private line.
could you excuse me for a moment, please, Kevin.
it's Chuck Toland, sir.
wait.
Chuck, did you find something?
I did, but don't get carried away.
it doesn't confirm your theory about how Roger died.
but it is suspicious.
I'm listening.
his girlfriend Samantha received a large lump-sum deposit in an off-shore bank account about three days after Roger's suicide.
you mean his alleged suicide.
right, sir.
where did the money come from?
I couldn't tell.
it looks like it's been washed.
there's no readily identifiable source.
So...What does this mean?
all it means is that she suddenly came into $400, 000.
if we're going to find out anything more, I'm going to need to talk to her personally.
is that how you want me to handle it?
no, If she's got anything to hide, she's not going to talk to a private investigator.
I agree.
so how do you want me to proceed?
I'll talk to her myself.
is she still at that brokerage firm?
Yeah, uh, Sloane Kittridge.
good.
I'm going to finish up here with Aldrich.
then I need you to take me somewhere, and keep it off the manifest.
I don't want anyone to know where we're going.
Yes, sir. - Agent Gedge.
Yes, sir.
you think chuck's taking advantage of me, don't you?
it's not my place to say that, sir.
I'm asking you anyway.
sir, the police and FBI have both investigated your son's death.
and yes, I believe this PI could be exploiting your grief for personal gain.
these so-called leads that he's generating have led nowhere.
my son didn't kill himself.
I'm sure of it.
Yes, sir.
can you check that socket again, please?
has FAA reported any more anomalies?
not since the first three.
maybe it was just a glitch?
or it could have been a ripple caused when they broke through the firewall and entered the system.
well, if they're in the system, I can't see them, and I've checked every elr socket.
keep looking.
uh, what's going to happen?
what do you mean?
if Almeida has broken through the firewall then we're screwed, right?
I mean, crashing couple planes is really nothing compared to contaminating the water system or bringing down the power grid...
don't think about it, Janis.
just stay task.
okay, so...
I will just stay calm, right?
Yeah.
pull up the second one.
you already looked at it.
I want to look at it again, pull it up.
have you found anything?
no, we keep looking at the same six forensic reports over and over.
what are you looking for, Jack?
an entry point.
they had access cards.
Yeah, but no one reported their access cards stolen, which means they were forged.
so...
these access cards have individual signatures, making them almost impossible to forge.
there's only a couple guys who can do it.
can you access old CTU files?
sure.
pull up august 1999.
code name: Hatteras.
just got a call from homeland.
they briefed the president but she's not ready to ground planes yet.
here you go. Hatteras file.
you know, you can hire a $14. 00-an-hour data applications geek to do this;
you don't need me.
I wouldn't advertise that.
there he is-- Gabriel Schector.
who is he?
he was a supplier.
Tony and I used him to buy things off-book.
see if he's in your database.
Yeah. He's there.
is he still in Los Angeles?
no. According to this earmark, he came to DV nine weeks ago.
the thefts started a week after that.
that's your guy.
do you have an address?
he's subletting an office downtown-- 1208 Naylor Road, suite 630.
all right, put a field team together, pick him up.
I'll call judge Simons, have a warrant ready.
that's a mistake.
Why?
you don't have time to go through the motions with Schector
you serve him with a warrant, he'll call his lawyers, he'll stall as long as he needs.
so, what's the alternative, Jack?
break in and torture the guy, like you used to do?
isn't that how you ended up in front of a senate sub-committee?
Oh, is this how it starts?
you get in my face, tighten your jaw, then if I say something you don't like, you slam me against the wall.
you have no idea what I do.
and last time I checked, you subpoenaed me.
you want my help, you want my advice, take it.
you don't, don't.
I don't care. - Mr. Bauer...
you said you used to work with this man, Schector.
how well does he know you?
he knows me.
Larry, can I talk to you for a second?
I want to take Ber with me.
no.
forget it. I'm not letting him put his hands on a suspect.
he won't need to put his hands on anybody.
my guess is if he's in the room, Schector will talk.
Renee, you saw what he just...
I'm trying to find Almeida before it's too late, and Schector is our best lead.
so you want to intimidate him with Bauer?
Schector knows how far Bauer might go.
let's use that.
Yeah, and if Schector doesn't blink, then what?
I'll keep Bauer on a short leash.
Renee, we're the FBI, not CTU.
we honor the law.
even when it's not convenient.
look, this situation is heating up fast, Larry.
the president's into it now, and she's expecting results.
Yeah, I know.
it's your call.
but I promise you, can handle Bauer.
all right.
but I'm holding you responsible.
and I'm sending backup teams.
you're coming with me, and you're doing this my way.
tell me about Schector.
out of San Diego, till he went on his own.
legitimate?
Yeah, at first, then he got greedy.
started using his connections to acquire technology, sell it on the gray market.
who'd he sell to, terrorists?
no. Usually foreign governments trying to get around treaties.
and how did you and Tony get involved with him?
we arrested him, we turned him.
he was a great conduit for intel.
CTU didn't mind that you were letting this guy stay in business?
CTU didn't know.
it was Just tony and me.
so you and Tony were tight?
yeah...
Yeah, we were close.
all right, so it sounds like Tony, who everyone thinks is dead, puts together a plan to hijack American security.
he contacts Schector to help him with this plan.
Yeah.
except you don't believe it.
that Tony's dirty.
I believe that Tony's alive.
and I believe he's doing something dangerous, and that we need to find him.
we confirmed Schector's inside.
how do you want to handle this?
I'm going in with Bauer.
alone?
I want Schector to talk.
I don't want to spook him.
call me when backup gets here.
Matobo's fighters are hidden outside the capitol in three camps.
our ground forces will join up with them once the air strikes are completed.
make sure general Wagner understands our priority is to maintain order in the streets.
the people need to see that their country's being governed under the rule of law.
what happens when Matobo's men execute general Juma without a trial?
should we intervene or let the mob tear them apart?
I'm meeting with Mr. Matobo in a few minutes.
I'll make sure he keeps his men in line.
and, Joe, I was wrong to dress you down in front of the joint chiefs.
I'm sorry.
no need to apologize, madame president.
you're under a lot of pressure.
that's still no excuse.
thank you ma'am, I appreciate that.
the fact remains, if you can't get behind this operation with both shoulders, I will need your resignation.
that won't be necessary, ma'am.
whatever doubts I have, I'll keep them to myself.
good.
excuse me, madame president.
what is it, Ethan?
I thought you'd want to know, Henry Aldrich has agreed to delay his broadcast for 24 hours.
I, uh, underestimated him.
letting him intervene was the right call.
well, that's some good news.
what about the firewall situation?
has the FBI made any progress?
they've identified a man who may have information.
they're about to question him.
it's more than likely Schector's not going to give you this information easily.
just remember, this is an FBI operation.
we work within the confines of the law.
you can threaten him, but do not lay hands on him.
the minute I see you crossing that line, I will pull you back, understood?
understood.
agent Walker, FBI.
I'm here to talk to Gabriel Schector.
just a second.
can I help you?
how are you, Gabe?
didn't know you were FBI.
I'm not.
just came along for the ride.
Mr. Bauer is here under my authority.
Oh, so I can hold you responsible for anything he does while he's here.
I have a witness.
sure.
okay.
come on in.
please.
have a seat.
this should be an interesting conversation.
how long's it been, Jack?
years.
how's the, uh...senate thing doing?
I hear they dismantled the CTU.
don't tell me.
it was your fault, wasn't it?
Mr. Schector, we're not here to make small talk.
I have questions.
well, you have my undivided attention.
Where's Tony Almeida?
in the ground, I suppose.
unless he was cremated.
didn't he die at CTU a while back?
you got an out here, Gabe.
they're not after you.
they're willing to accept that you didn't know what Tony Almeidaas going to do with the components that you helped him steal.
nobody I knew stole anything, and if they did, I knew nothing about it.
this is far more serious than you know, Mr. Schector.
if you help us find Almeida, I can see to it that you're kept in the clear.
otherwise, you could be a co-conspirator to multiple terrorist acts.
no, well, I think this conversation is over.
I tried to answer all your questions honestly, but I think, from now on, you can speak to my lawyers.
so, good-bye, Jack.
and good luck with the senate.
hope they fry your ass.
Ari, could you show these people to the door, please.
are you sure you want to play it like this?
Yeah, that's the way I want to play, jack.
drop your weapon. -Drop it now!
okay, okay, okay.
you two are going to prison!
this was unprovoked!
unprovoked!
your man Ari was going for his gun-- I've got a witness.
why don't we try having this conversation again.
where is Tony Almeida?
no.
I'm not talking to you.
where is he?
Tony Almeida's dead.
what do you want me to do?
this is your call.
do whatever it takes.
this is against the law.
you can't do this.
I'm gonna enjoy this.
enjoy what?
all right, all right!
I'll tell you what I know!
there's no need for me to lose my good looks over this.
okay.
last time I saw Almeida...
are you all right?
Yeah.
tell your men they've got a shooter on top of the Columbia Building, heading south.
shots fired. Suspects are down.
the shooter's on the roof of the Columbia Building across the street.
seal all exits.
get away from this, Jack.
there's nothing you or the FBI can do about this.
just stay away.
Tony, just talk to me.
what the hell's going...
what's going on at Schector's office?
I don't know. They haven't checked in yet.
GSA 117, northeast three, descend pilot's discretion, direct JFK.
northeast three, roger, we're starting our descent now.
GSA 117, descend and maintain 2, 000, expect holding runway four-right.
GSA 117, I did not receive your read-back.
acknowledge. Over.
GSA 117, acknowledge.
Mr. Paulson, I've lost comm with GSA 117.
try the emergency channels.
I did.
nothing.
and there's no fault on my board.
I redirected twice.
something's interfering with our comm.
call back FBI!
tell them we have a 767 on approach no longer under our control!
GSA 117, acknowledge.
GSA117, this is northeast three.
go ahead, air traffic control.
advise passing 7, 000, maintain 1, 500.
traffic ahead reporting moderate turbulence.
should be a smoother ride for you down there.
Roger that, northeast three.
understand, northeast three, GAS117.
enter descent for 1, 500.
all right.
get ready to make the course change.
we're really taking this all the way.
you just need to do exactly what I tell you to do.
this is Colonel Ike Dubaku.
we have the CIP device.
we demand the complete withdrawal of the U. S. Naval Strike Force by this time tomorrow.
you are recalling the invasion force.
well, that determination has yet to be made.
I implore you do not abandon my country.
it's Samantha Roth.
she says, she has new information regarding my son's death.
Roger was tasked with auditing the brokers in his department.
he uncovered other blind accounts accounts that were traced to a senior member of your wife's administration.
it's all here.
account numbers, trading records everything that he knew.
Bauer must have worked out this escape with Almeida's people.
that son of a bitch played me.
had me believing the Bureau was compromised
someone on the inside working against us.
I realize now it was him all along.
he played us both.
I'm going to make this right, Larry.
whatever it takes, I will find Bauer and Almeida.
you're out of time, Mr. Tanner. Tell me what you know.
I'm not going to tell you a damn thing.
where is Almeida?
Tanner says Almeida's crew has a plan to abduct former Prime Minister of Sangala.
Matobo?
when? - Pretty much now.
why didn't you call the authorities?
he couldn't, Jack. - Why not?
he found out Emerson's client was Dubaku.
that's who you believe has agents inside the government.
Dubaku is the key to this thing, Jack.
if we're going to uncover the conspiracy we have to get to him before he leaves the U. S.
I got away from the FBI. - Yeah, I heard.
I also heard it was Jack Bauer who broke you out.
he's on board now.
the package is a person.
former Prime Minister Matobo of Sangala.
the assignment is to grab him, deliver him to Colonel Dubaku.
Where's Matobo?! Where is he?!
it's a safe room; reinforced concrete.
Jack, we leave here without Matobo we lose our only chance of getting at Dubaku.
Matobo's security chief said there's a safe room at his residence.
they should have him and his wife locked down by now.
they'll be safe till your team gets there.
your priority is to grab Almeida and bring him back here.
we'll make every effort to use nonlethal force but Almeida's crew is ex-military.
they're going to be hard to subdue unless my men can return fire.
I understand you'll be exposing your men - but it's a risk you need to take. - Sir...
Almeida is the only viable lead we've got to retrieve the CIP device.
you need to bring him in alive, is that understood?
understood.
let's move out.
we'll get our updates in the van.
open the safe room.
I will keep going until you open the door.
I've already told you.
once it's closed, you can only open it from the inside.
do whatever you want to me but you will never get into that room.
we've got to get Matobo.
without him, we've got nothing.
I know.
find a way in yet? - No.
Litvak, any luck reconnecting the intercom?
not yet.
I'm working on it.
sir, this just came in...
I'm in the middle of a field op, Erika.
I don't really have a lot of time right now.
it's from the attorney general.
I think you should make time for this.
what is it? - Tanner's lawyers are filing a complaint against the Bureau.
Walker.
Renee, it's me.
I'm less than 15 minutes away from Matobo's house.
when I get there, I'll recon for the Tac Team.
stop a second. - What?
this information about Matobo being abducted...
tell me how you got it
you know how I got it--I questioned Tanner.
you questioned him? - Yeah.
Tanner's lawyers are saying you locked them out of his hospital room, then cut off his ventilator.
they said you applied pressure to his gunshot wound
we needed Almeida's location
Tanner was not about to cooperate
so you tortured him.
what the hell were you thinking?
I got the information we needed.
information that may not even be valid.
you know as well as I do,
coercive interrogation is unreliable.
no, Tanner was not lying. - You know that?
how do you know he wasn't just telling you what you wanted to hear?
I'll find out when I get to Matobo's house.
no, you're not going to Matobo's.
you're coming back here to the office.
the attorney general is sending somebody here, and you're going to tell him everything that happened.
Larry...
it's my fault that Bauer and Almeida are still at large.
please, let me play this out.
I will deal with the consequences after we find the CIP device.
no, the field team is on the way, they can handle this.
Renee, get back here now.
I'm sorry, Larry, but I need to make this right.
Renee?
damn it.
I'm glad you're all right, babe.
the flight attendant said something about us getting a priority clearance to land.
uh, you got lucky.
did I?
I mean, it happened just after we spoke, so I thought maybe you had something to do with it.
me? How could I have done anything?
listen, I might be late tonight.
there's a lot going on at work.
I haven't seen you in a week.
I thought we could spend some time together.
dinner, and maybe...
...you know.
sorry, I have to go. I have to get back to work.
call me later.
okay.
did you deploy the field teams?
Yeah, they just left.
we need to coordinate with Matobo's security chief get him back on the line.
these people, they work for Dubaku, don't they?
possibly.
Yes, probably.
but if they wanted me dead, I would be dead.
then what do they want?
names.
names?
of my allies inside Sangala.
you would die before you exposed them, they know that.
Yes, they do, but.
then it's me.
it's me.
they want to use me to get you to talk?
don't worry.
we'll be safe in here until they leave.
Ule, I'm scared.
Alama, listen to me.
we need to stay calm.
we'll be fine.
the FBI knows we are here.
they'll come for us soon.
okay?
Mr. Matobo?
I know you can see and hear me.
come out now and nobody has to get hurt.
you are wasting your time.
come out now or I will kill your man.
you have one minute.
fifty...
I am prepared to die, sir.
for you and for Sangala.
eto'o is right.
without you, Sangala has no leader.
the people need you.
30 seconds.
Eto'o's courage is stronger than your threats.
he is willing to die.
and for that sacrifice he has my eternal gratitude, and the gratitude of the people of Sangala.
ten seconds.
time's up.
I just got through to him 15 minutes ago.
well, he's not answering now.
then get me someone else at the residence.
it's the FBI.
does the FBI know we're here?
Tanner.
he's the only one who knew we were grabbing Matobo.
he must have talked.
sir, we need to go before they get here.
not without Matobo.
those walls are two feet thick.
even if we blow a hole with a shaped charge they'll kill everyone inside.
I think I found a way.
yeah? Like what?
we can gas them out.
we don't have anything! - We'll find something!
there's a ventilation system running straight into the safe room.
if I can feed the gas through that, it'll flush 'em out.
the FBI is coming!
they won't be here for at least 15 minutes.
what are you talking about? How do you know?
if they knew anything before we got here they'd have evacuated Matobo.
that's just guesswork.
the tac teams are staged out of the DC branch office
that's 21 miles from here, with traffic.
that gives us at least 15 minutes.
we're not leaving without Matobo.
that's what Dubaku is paying us for.
you're not seriously considering... - Shut up!
what kind of gas are you talking about?
ammonium dysterate.
we can make it from basic household products.
do it. - Tony, give me a hand.
Jack, you do know ammonium dysterate could kill them as easily as flush them out.
that's a chance we're gonna have to take.
delivering Matobo is our only chance to get to Dubaku and the CIP device.
I got it. Grab those bowls.
gotten into the vent yet?
Yeah!
the FBI will be here any minute.
Mr. Matobo...
we've accessed the air intake to your safe room.
we are now feeding in ammonium dysterate gas.
if you do not open the door you will die.
I believe that you are willing to sacrifice your life.
but are you also willing to sentence your wife to death?
Ule...
you know what they will do if we open the door.
I know.
I can't let them force me to name names.
our cause is more important than we are.
take my hand.
Janis Gold? - Yes?
I'm Raymond Howell from the Attorney General's office
is there some place we can talk?
about? - What happened at the hospital, Ms. Gold.
agent Walker's being accused of torturing your suspect.
he's not my suspect, I have no idea what happened after I left that room, I am not involved.
the suspect's attorneys claim that you sent them to the wrong hospital room to buy Agent Walker more time.
so it sounds to me like you were involved.
this is going to have to wait.
Janis, I need you on comm, now. Agent Moss - the A. G. personally initiated this investigation. - Howell open your eyes, we have a situation.
she cannot deal with this right now.
please have a seat. Come here.
what's going on?
we think Almeida and his crew may already at Matobo's.
and we can't reach Renee to warn her.
why can't you reach her? - When I heard what she did to Tanner, I ordered her back to headquarters to talk to the A. G's office and she, uh, refused, turned off her cell.
I need you running point on SWAT.
okay, thanks.
Hillinger, keep trying to reach Renee.
we're running out of time.
put more gas in!
if we do, it'll kill them instantly.
how much time is it going to take, Jack?
it's up to them.
I can't breathe.
just close your eyes, let it happen.
I know if we open that door, it will be worse.
I love you.
Alama, no!
get him out of there!
get the woman, too.
just breathe, you'll be all right.
just breathe.
okay, let's go!
I'm so sorry.
come on.
it's Moss.
Larry, it's Renee.
Renee, listen.
Bauer and Almeida may already be at Matobo's.
they are, I've got a visual on them loading Matobo and his wife into a truck.
where the hell is SWAT? - How long for SWAT?
they're still about five minutes out.
Renee, listen to me, I want you to stand down and fallback until they get there.
do you hear me?
let me just get a plate on the vehicle.
drop the gun.
Renee?
Renee?
damn it!
Janis, try getting her back.
whose SWAT team will be first on scene?
Remick's.
get him for me, now.
move!
Mr. Emerson!
far as I can tell, she's alone.
damn you, Bauer, you son of a bitch.
she's FBI.
her name is Walker. She's the one that pulled me out of the Senate hearing to help find Tony.
don't be stupid.
what are you talking about?
how much does Tanner know about your operation?
enough to cause problems.
we need to find out from her what he told the FBI-- till then - we do nothing. - He's right, David.
we need to be sure nothing else has been compromised.
get her in the cage.
don't you touch me.
get your hands off of me! - Shut up or I will shut you up.
she's clean.
let's go!
do you have Matobo? - Yeah.
and the wife, but we ran into a complication.
a complication?
FBI knew about the operation.
which means Tanner talked.
I don't like this. - No, neither do I.
we got one of their agents with us, her name's Walker.
I need you to check with your source at the Bureau, find out how much she knows.
all right. - If your source doesn't come up with anything, we'll interrogate her when we get there.
can't believe I trusted you.
you lying son of a bitch.
this is important, man.
to him and me.
Thanks, appreciate it.
any luck?
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry it took so long, but I tracked down a friend who does crypto for the private sector-- he says he should be able to crack the files on the thumb-drive.
provided the, uh, encryption isn't military grade or better.
I doubt Roger would have had access to anything like that.
he also said you'd have a lot easier job if you just went to the NSA.
not until we know how badly my wife's administration's been compromised.
my friend said he'd meet us at his apartment in 20 minutes.
do you trust him?
yes
Samantha says the documents would prove my son was murdered.
I'll make sure he understands this can't go anywhere.
thank you, Brian.
you don't know what it's been like.
all this time knowing in my bones
Roger didn't commit suicide and having people just tolerate me tell me it was my grief talking.
I'm going to find the people who did this to my son Brian.
and I am going to make them pay.
sir if I may...
what is it?
shouldn't you at least tell the President what you're doing?
I can't take this to my wife...
until I can prove it.
you wanted to see me?
one thing I've learned:
presidents don't make new friends.
that's why they lean on their old ones.
I'll need your support Ethan.
I'm going to authorize the military operation in Sangala as planned.
Madame President...
you don't need to list the consequences, Ethan.
any action I take in West Africa will likely result in a terrorist attack here but if I take no action, an entire generation of Sangalans will be wiped out.
your critics will point out you took an oath to protect the people of this country.
and the way to do that is not give in to blackmail and threats.
Ethan...
taking a stand against the genocide in Sangala has reestablished our leadership and our moral authority in the eyes of the world.
I cannot and I will not back down.
yes?
Madame President, Secretary of State Stevens is here to see you.
it's urgent. - Send him in.
what is it Joe?
the FBI just reported that Prime Minister Matobo and his wife were abducted from their residence.
What?!
abducted by whom?
his bodyguards identified Jack Bauer and Tony Almeida as two of the men involved which means Dubaku has the CIP device and Matobo.
where is the FBI on finding him?
do they have any active leads?
not yet Madame President.
they're just beginning the search operation.
I think we need to talk about how Matobo's abduction affects the invasion.
Matobo is the only man with enough popular support and strength to lead Sangala after an invasion.
without him, the country would collapse in complete bloodshed and chaos.
which means the best course of action may be to meet Dubaku's demand and withdraw our forces.
the best course of action is to find Matobo and the people who took him.
and make sure the FBI brings in every relevant agency.
yes ma'am.
so... where do we stand with your decision to go through with the invasion?
we still have 30 minutes before Dubaku's deadline.
I want Matobo found by then.
I just sent you new search coordinates.
upload a grid to the ground teams please.
I already did; they're adjusting their perimeter now.
all right thanks.
listen Erika.
what?
I'm sorry I was a jerk before.
you're worried about your wife on a plane.
it's cool.
she's on the ground now.
her plane landed; she got lucky.
that's great news.
I'm glad she's okay.
hey Sean.
I can't stop thinking about last night.
yeah me, too.
excuse me.
Sean, I need you to babysit the downloads on my computer.
they're coming in from the forensics team at Matobo's residence.
now please.
okay sure.
excuse me.
Remick's team just finished a sweep of the Matobo residence.
he's on line two if you want to talk to him.
Janis wait.
did you find Renee?
no, sir.
but one of Matobo's bodyguards saw her being taken by Bauer and Almeida.
then she's alive.
she's with the Matobos.
we'll run a trace on her cell.
can't do that, sir.
we recovered Agent Walker's phone and weapon on-site.
forensics is still sweeping the scene.
all right, I want to be the first to know if they find something. Yes, sir.
all right, um...
get Renee's picture and description out to all agencies.
put me in the queue for a real-time update from Homeland.
okay.
Janis.
I want everybody in this office to make finding her their top priority.
is that understood?
it is.
are you going to be okay?
what are you talking about?
just get to work.
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you, sir.
you have nothing to apologize for.
how much are they paying you, Jack?
I hope it's enough to live with yourself when they kill innocent Americans with the CIP device.
shut up.
how many people will die because of what you're doing?
Emerson.
you were right.
agent Walker broke Tanner.
how much did Tanner spill?
other than the details of Matobo's abduction, nothing.
you're sure? - Positive.
Walker is extraneous.
kill her before you get here.
okay, we'll be with you soon.
be quick about it.
Dubaku's anxious to get his hands on the prime minister.
Nichols checked with his source at the Bureau.
Walker doesn't know anything that can compromise the operation.
you trust Nichols' source?
Nichols does.
that's good enough for me.
Litvak, change of plan.
take a right on Morrison Avenue.
what's on Morrison?
abandoned construction site-- we'll dump her there.
shouldn't we find out for ourselves what she knows?
Nichols wants her out of the way before we deliver Matobo.
I understand your deployment's stretched thin but one of our own agents is missing.
that's a priority, too.
look, look, I don't care where you find the men.
just get them out there looking.
I've never seen him like that.
he looks like his head's going to explode.
thank you.
well, I'm not surprised.
Meaning?
meaning it's fairly obvious he has feelings for Renee.
why do you think that?
Instinct-- I just know.
stay on task.
general Juma says the American carrier troop still has not begun to withdraw.
well, they haven't launched their invasion either.
I gave this president a deadline and it's almost past.
apparently, our demonstration was not convincing enough.
this woman is more stubborn than we expected.
once she realizes we have Matobo, she'll change her mind.
and if she doesn't?
you have the CIP module.
launch another attack.
let's see how stubborn she is after American civilians start dying.
when will Matobo be here?
within an hour.
what caused the delay?
an FBI agent got in the way.
I needed to make sure she hadn't compromised our operation.
and has she? - No.
as soon as my men get rid of her
I'll pick up Matobo personally and bring him to you.
this friend of yours so you're sure he's going to have everything he needs to access the files?
he said he didn't think it'd be a problem.
thank you, Brian.
for all your help, and your loyalty.
you don't need to thank me, sir.
Yes, I do.
you're risking a lot to do this especially after what happened this morning.
you can thank me after we confirm the information is on that drive.
said the key should be under the mat.
there it is.
when will your friend be here?
he should be here any minute.
would you mind turning on the air?
it's really hot in here.
of course, sir.
it's Samantha and Roger.
this is Samantha's apartment, sir.
you.
I'm sorry, sir.
Why?
Roger was looking into things he shouldn't have.
I tried to protect him too but he wouldn't let me.
he inherited your determination.
you killed my son.
you...
killed Roger.
it's Tetradyzine, sir.
it's a neuromuscular paralytic.
don't try to speak. The Tetradyzine also paralyzes your vocal chords.
if it's any consolation, sir
Roger died quickly.
and I'm going to make sure...
you do too.
situation here is in control.
are you tracking Ms. Roth?
Yeah.
time to get her back to her apartment.
are you sure this is going to work?
it'll work fine.
Mr. Taylor came to her apartment to confront her about Roger.
lost his temper, killed her.
took his own life, okay?
all right.
I'll let you know if there are any problems.
I really am sorry, sir.
if only you'd left well enough alone.
ms. Roth. - Agent Vossler.
Henry Taylor sent me.
Mr. Taylor's been looking into the matter you discussed.
he believes you're in imminent danger.
my God...
what am I supposed to do?
he wants me to place you in protective custody.
escort you to a safe house.
now? - My orders are to take you there immediately.
we can stop at your apartment first so you can pack clothes, essentials.
uh, I just need to call my office.
not until we get you locked down, ma'am.
please.
okay.
this way, please.
so it looks like your friend from the A. G. is still here.
I know. - What's going on?
he wants to talk to me about what Renee did to Tanner in the hospital.
what did Renee do to Tanner at the hospital?
I don't know, but Howell is claiming she tortured Tanner.
Renee?
I don't believe that.
maybe you should.
Tanner wasn't talking...
and she kicked me out of the room.
and then the next thing I know the alarm on his ventilator is going off.
and Renee had the information she needed?
if you weren't in the room, you don't have a problem.
I do, actually-- she asked me to stall his lawyers.
and you did?
Yes. - Come on, Gold.
what were you thinking?
she gave me a direct order-- what was I supposed to do?
say no.
do you realize if they prove that Renee tortured him you're an accessory?
and Larry is not gonna protect you.
I know. Let's just hope the A. G.
will have moved on to something else when this is all over.
I'm getting back to work.
agent Moss.
what do you want?
forgive my interruption, but it's just been brought to my attention that Agent Walker is missing.
Yes, she may have been abducted by the same people responsible for kidnapping Matobo and his wife.
I'm very sorry to hear that.
and want you to know that I appreciate the enormous pressure that you and the Bureau are under.
glad to hear it.
nevertheless, the Attorney General is still pressing for a full account of Agent Walker's handling of the Tanner interrogation, and at this moment,
Janis Gold is the only witness available to me.
she's not available to you, Howell.
I already told you, she can't be spared right now.
I only need a short time with her.
you can't have her.
are you going to force me to get the A. G. on the line?
you've got to be kidding me.
you really want to press this right now?!
we're in the middle of an international crisis.
I'm aware of that.
and all you seem interested in is condemning the actions of an agent who's in God-knows-what danger just so you can nail her to the wall.
if Agent Walker broke federal guidelines and used illegal tactics to get information, then, yes, she will be prosecuted.
then maybe you can let us get her back first before you throw her to the wolves,
I mean, if that's okay with you.
yes?
Larry? NSA just relayed a call they intercepted to us.
Renee was referenced.
referenced how?
Janis?
I think you need to come hear it yourself.
I'll be right there.
excuse me.
we're not done here.
agent Moss!
did you source it?
five minutes ago.
it's legit.
check it again.
I already did, twice.
Where's the intercept code?
right there above the decryption algorithm.
they routed it to us on a priority channel.
were we able to get verbal confirmation?
it's not going to change the content of the call, Janis.
I know, I just...
what's on the NSA intercept?
what? You said Renee was referenced. What's on it?
it's only a fragment, but she's referenced, yeah.
enough to get a GPS fix?
the clip's not even 20 seconds long.
the best we can say is that it's in the Metro area.
play it.
emerson, you were right,
agent Walker broke Tanner.
how much did Tanner spill?
other than the details of Matobo's abduction, nothing.
you're sure?
Walker is extraneous.
kill her before you get here.
we'll be with you soon.
be quick about it.
Dubaku's anxious to get his hands on the Prime Minister.
when was this call made?
ten minutes ago.
run a trace.
I already did.
run it again!
Jack.
the ditch.
kill her.
Yeah.
Tony.
step down.
step down!
you could either walk or I could drag you.
you're really going to kill me?
I'm not going to beg for my life, Jack.
so everything that you told me was a lie?
I'm doing what I have to.
I don't expect you to understand.
I understand that you are a traitor and a murderer.
turn around.
no.
you're going to have to look at me when you pull that trigger.
I said turn around.
if you trust me, I will get you through this alive.
get on your knees.
for a second there, I didn't think you were going to do it.
now bury her.
we're on a timetable.
can't have anyone finding the body before we're out of the country.
give him a hand, Tony.
??
you son of a bitch.
you're behind my son's death.
Madame President... I have your husband.
you will have your forces with drawn from around my country, Sangala, immediately and permanently.
or your husband will die a slow and certain death.
I just wanted to make sure that you were still coming to dinner tonight.
Marika, I can't. I'll make it up to you.
if you're looking for Marika, she's not with me.
I'm looking for you, Samuel.
or whatever your real name is.
now, I don't know who you really are, and I don't care.
I just want you out of my sister's life.
keep an incident quiet until what Jack and I are doing goes down.
what incident?
Vossler's dead.
Jack killed him at the hotel on 18th and Reagan. It was self-defense.
damn it, Renee, what the hell are you doing with this guy?
you're supposed to bring suspects in, not murder them.
until we know who Dubaku's source is there, you've got to handle this outside of the bureau.
Dubaku is the only person with the names of the people who betrayed you within your government It's imperative that we find him.
you resigned from government service and the Senate regards you as having been a renegade agent.
how am I supposed to know where your loyalties really lie?
with all due respect, Madame President, ask around.
I got an address for Henry Taylor.
get an ambulance!
???
no one else gets through here.
follow me.
it's Henry Taylor, the president's husband, but that information is not to be disseminated. Clear?
I...
Mr. Taylor, don't speak. I need you to save your energy.
over here!
excuse me. Step back, please.
this is Unit Six.
we have a gunshot trauma to the chest...
nine-millimeter round.
nine- millimeter substernal. - Pulse is rapid.
are you okay? - Yeah.
I'm gonna call the president.
I want you to search all the rooms, see if you can get anything off their hardware that's going to tell us where Dubaku went.
this is Jack Bauer. I need to speak with the president.
hold one moment, please.
Madame President, I would encourage you not to lose hope.
Dubaku knows we tried to deceive him, Ethan.
he has no reason to keep Henry alive.
Madame President, Jack Bauer is on line one.
put him through.
Mr. Bauer, this is President Taylor.
Madame President, we have your husband.
he is alive, but he sustained a gunshot wound to the chest.
how bad is it?
EMTs are stabilizing him.
they're getting ready to transfer him to West Arlington Hospital.
Mr. Bauer, be more specific.
is my husband going to be okay?
we're not gonna know anything until the doctors see him.
ma'am, I have to warn you, he has lost a lot of blood.
Jack, it's Bill. Do you have Dubaku?
Negative-- he was gone before we got here.
Madame President, since your husband was the only leverage that Dubaku had left, it's safe to say that he is trying to leave the country now.
have you any idea how he intends to do that?
not at this time.
unfortunately, all his men were killed during the assault.
agent Walker and I will stay behind. We'll continue to search the area.
we have to assume that Dubaku has an exit strategy already in place.
whatever we're going to do to find him, we're going to have to do it fast.
Yes.
thank you, Mr. Bauer.
please keep me apprised on everything.
Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry.
I am so sorry, Madame President.
Ethan, I'm going to the hospital to be with my husband.
ma'am, that's not possible.
you're executing a military invasion.
my generals can execute it perfectly well without me.
we can't ignore the fact the Secret Service has been compromised.
there's no way we can ensure your safety - outside the White House. - I don't give a damn.
I am not going to be held prisoner in this office while my husband is fighting for his life.
now, either find someone to take me to the hospital or I'll drive there myself.
Madame President, you know my record of service.
if it's acceptable to you, I'm willing to assume responsibility for your security.
bill, you're no longer credentialed. You don't have the authority.
until we capture Dubaku and interrogate him, we have no idea who in the government is working for him.
you do not know who you can trust.
but I can trust you.
I brought this conspiracy to your attention, Madame President.
I would hope that I've earned it.
what do you need from me?
reinstate my government clearance, allow me the authority to vet White House staff, and allow me to bring one of my people into FBI to provide Larry Moss with tactical support.
who is it that you want to bring in?
I can vouch for her; she's the best there is.
her clearances were also revoked when CTU was decommissioned.
isn't there anyone capable of handling these duties without our having to reinstate her?
someone in the Bureau is on Dubaku's payroll.
until we find out who it is,
Larry Moss can't take the chance of bringing his own people into a manhunt for Dubaku.
all right.
the Director of White House Secret Service Operations is Agent Hovis.
I'll order him to turn over security protocols to you.
I know Ted Hovis, Madame President.
he's not gonna like this; he's gonna fight us.
well, considering that agents under his charge are responsible for what happened to my husband,
I don't give a damn what he likes.
you have your provisional appointment, Mr. Buchanan, under the authority of this office.
thank you, Madame President.
you can thank me by getting me to the hospital.
I'll make the arrangements.
Madame President... - Your concerns are clear to me, Ethan, but I've made my decision.
I'm only trying to do my job looking out for your interests.
my interest right now is catching Ike Dubaku.
he has killed scores of Americans today, he tried to kill my husband, and he has corrupted our government.
whatever it takes, I want that son of a bitch found.
samuel, what are you doing here?
we need to talk.
uh, okay, well, I get a break in 20 minutes.
no, now.
come on.
what is it? You're scaring me.
something has come up.
I need to leave the country.
what? When?
right away.
I don't understand. W-When are you coming back?
Marika, listen to me.
I haven't been entirely honest with you.
my passport visa expired a couple months ago and I've been in the country illegally.
I'm afraid the immigration people have caught up with me.
it was my sister, wasn't it?
she reported you, didn't she?
that doesn't matter now.
what is important is I have to leave the country tonight, and I want you to come with me.
tonight?
Marika, we've talked about this.
I promised you that one day I would take you away from here, give you the happiness that you deserve.
samuel, I-I want that, too, but...
but not tonight, not so soon. - Marika, I don't have time to argue with you!
I'm sorry.
I can't leave Rosa.
she needs me; I'm the only one she has to take care of her.
you know that. - I know, I know.
which is why she's going to join us.
join us? - As soon as possible.
I could only arrange tickets for both of us tonight, but I want you to promise not to tell your sister of our plans, at least not yet.
I have to; I can't just run off.
no, no, no, she might cause trouble for us, make it impossible for us to leave.
I promise you your sister will join us within a couple of days of our arrival.
okay?
our arrival where? - Belize.
I have shown you the photographs of my home there.
do you love me?
you know I do.
say you'll come.
I'll get my things.
I still need to finalize our arrangements.
I want you to go home and pack.
wait for my call. - All right.
yes? - It's me.
have you made the preparations?
almost.
it's been tricky clearing a flight corridor since FAA still has most private and commercial aircraft grounded.
I have faith you'll manage.
the arrangements are for two passengers?
just as you requested.
are you sure you want to leave now, Colonel?
I can't imagine General Juma will be pleased to learn that you're abandoning your mission.
the mission is over.
I have done what I can do.
if that is not enough for Juma, then to hell with him.
I've got your passports and itinerary in hand.
meet me at our usual spot in half an hour.
I'll bring them.
no, we'll meet in the lobby of the Roosevelt Continental Hotel.
that's not a good idea.
it'll be crowded there at this hour.
I know.
I want the meeting earlier.
I'll see you in 15 minutes.
go.
I can't get it to boot.
hard drive must be fried. - Damn it.
let's search the bodies. Start with him.
Yeah. - Renee, it's me.
bill Buchanan just briefed me on your situation.
what's Henry Taylor's status?
they've got him in an ambulance en route to West Arlington Hospital.
I don't know his current condition.
Buchanan told me you and Bauer were in a firefight.
Yeah, we took down six of Dubaku's men, but Dubaku was gone before we got there.
you all right?
I've been in worse.
???
I'm fine, Larry.
Really?
I'm not so sure about that.
and what is that supposed to mean?
I'm looking at a report faxed to me from Metro Police.
a Mrs. Carol Vossler is claiming an unidentified woman held her and her child hostage at gunpoint.
she says the woman threatened to kill her son.
Larry, we discussed this.
we needed to get Vossler to tell us where Taylor was being held.
it was the only leverage we had.
Yeah, right, whatever's necessary.
Jack Bauer's rationalization for every unethical action he takes.
it worked, Larry. Doesn't that count for something?
Renee, Jack Bauer is about to be strung up by a senate subcommittee, and you are following his playbook.
you already got the AG's office looking into that thing you pulled with Tanner's respirator, and now this.
no one was actually hurt. - No one...?
Renee, Bauer killed the woman's husband!
Renee, I swear to you, I am scared of what is happening to you.
you put these people through hell and it doesn't bother you.
I didn't say that it doesn't bother me, Larry.
I said that it worked.
of course it bothers me.
I can see that woman's face.
she and her child staring at me with such...
she had no idea that her husband was a killer, a traitor to his country, and she looked at me like I was the monster.
agent Walker.
hold on.
I cross-referenced the information on these PDAs.
I came across some banking transactions.
all from a series of accounts registered to the same address.
you think it's a safe house? - It's worth a shot.
Larry, we may have an address on Dubaku.
21917 Euclid Street. Apartment six.
21917 Euclid Street, unit six. We're moving out now.
can you provide sat surveillance?
Yeah, Bill Buchanan's sending somebody over to run tech, but until she's up and running, you're gonna have to go in blind.
okay. We'll be in touch.
you sure you're okay?
I'm fine.
??
federal investigations continue into the terrorist acts that have gripped the nation's capital, as well as the people of Kidron, Ohio.
despite assurances by President Taylor in her national address that the threat has passed, sources at the White House will not confirm that all those responsible have been accounted for.
now, are you sure you're not gonna need my help?
I'm just running FBI ops temporarily until they catch Dubaku.
once they find him, hopefully he'll tell us the names of all the people on his payroll that are inside our government.
and then, we can go home?
then, we can go home.
well, just be careful.
all right?
cause if Buchanan's right and Dubaku has someone working inside the Bureau...
I'll watch my back. You just watch Prescott.
okay, sweetheart, Mommy has to go to work.
you be good, okay?
Bye, Mommy.
you be good, too. - I will.
Bye.
and if you get all jammed up, you know where to find me.
I need you to cross-reference our deployments with Homeland.
make sure the requisition numbers match up.
after that, you can catch up on the hourlies. - Are you joking?
that is busy work, administrative crap you're handing me.
I don't have the time or the inclination right now to explain my assignments to you.
just get it done.
agent Moss, Chloe O'Brian just cleared security.
she's on her way up. - All right, thank you.
Janis, set up a secure VPN socket. Port it to the conference room.
why do you need a VPN socket?
I'm bringing in a consultant from Homeland to confirm there are no lingering gaps in the CIP firewall.
that's fine. Take that downstairs.
ms. O'Brian, Larry Moss.
welcome to the FBI. - Hi.
you can call me Chloe.
all right, we're right in here.
Buchanan said you'd be up to speed.
I'm up. - Good.
agent Walker and Bauer are pursuing a potential lead on Dubaku.
they're en route to this address in the Mount Pleasant District.
agent Walker's requesting satellite support.
what's the matter? Is something wrong?
I'm feeling a little exposed here.
if someone out there is working for Dubaku, shouldn't we be doing this more covertly?
as far as anyone knows, you're working on shoring up our firewall.
besides, this is the only space available where you'll have full access to our server.
our network doesn't support remote modules.
that's inefficient.
whoever set your network up that way didn't know what they were doing.
I set our network up that way.
Oh.
okay.
something else?
you worked with Bauer for a long time, didn't you?
seven years, on and off.
that's impressive.
that you survived the experience.
what are you talking about?
only that a lot of people didn't.
his own wife.
are you saying it's Jack's fault his wife was killed?
you tell me.
Jack Bauer is the most trustworthy, honorable man I know, and he's my friend.
maybe you should worry less about him and more about the mole in your office working for Dubaku.
is that Chloe O'Brian?
what? - In the conference room.
Chloe O'Brian-- she was senior analyst at CTU.
I once took a seminar she gave. What's she doing here?
Larry said Homeland sent her over to check for residual breaches from the firewall attack.
huh. - What?
it just doesn't sound like her area of expertise.
besides, as far as I know, she's been inactive since CTU was decommissioned.
your passports and travel itinerary.
a Hawker-Sdley 748 is fueling at Taft Airfield.
be ready to fly within a half hour, get you to the Cayman Islands.
you shouldn't have any trouble getting to Belize from there.
I need a car to the airfield and a driver.
I assumed you had your own transportation.
it's not for me.
I see.
it's for the girl.
well, I'm not sure I can find someone I trust on such short notice.
Really?
what about your man at the bar?
excuse me?
or one of the two on the balcony watching us now?
or the two in the black Town Car waiting for me to leave?
do you think I am a fool, Mr. Burnett?
I know you people see me as a liability now.
these men are here to guarantee your safety, Colonel, not to threaten it.
guarantee my safety.
how nice.
and said with such sincerity.
I want you to take this message back with you.
if anything should happen to me on my way out of the country
an accident or an assassination attempt, anything
if the plane that you were so generous to donate decides to explode, a data file with all the names and bank transactions of all those involved will be sent to the Justice Department.
that is completely unnecessary.
the same holds true if anything should happen to Marika Donoso.
I swear to you, she knows nothing of this.
she is no threat to you.
make sure your driver knows this before he brings her to me.
do you understand what I am saying?
I want you to tell me that you understand what I am saying to you, so there will be no mistakes.
I understand. - Good.
the one thing I have learned in the company of mercenaries, Mr. Burnett, is that ultimately, they care about nothing but their own survival.
good day.
I was right.
Dubaku suspected we were gonna take him out, and apparently, he's assembled evidence to use as an insurance policy.
we need to make sure he gets out of the country and safely into exile.
otherwise, we're all compromised.
I'll make the calls.
what are you doing?
where are you going?
Rosa, listen to me.
we're going away from here. All of us.
well, what do you mean, all?
samuel told me the truth.
he's an illegal, just like you thought.
he has to leave the country, and I've agreed to go with him.
you're leaving me?
no, no, only for a short time. You're gonna come, too.
samuel's made plans. We're gonna live with him in his home in Belize.
he's lying to you.
he's not. - I won't let you do this!
my God, Rosa.
I have taken care of you my entire life.
I've sacrificed everything for you.
why can't you let me have this? - I don't trust him.
Oh, well, you never liked any man who's ever shown an interest in me.
every chance I've ever had at happiness, you found some way of ruining it.
but not this time.
Marika, I'm begging you, listen to me.
no. - Marika, please.
stop.
move!
Marika, please.
listen to me. I'm begging you, Marik...
FBI-- don't move!
get on your knees now! On your knees!
both of you, put your hands behind your head, interlock your fingers.
now!
do not move.
we're clear.
where is Dubaku?
who? - Don't play games with me!
Ike Dubaku-- we traced bank accounts to this address.
now, where is he?
we don't know who you're talking about.
?? Let me make y and make this easier for you.
you know this man?
no.
you're lying to me.
why are you lying to me?!
let me see.
that's him-- we know him.
he calls himself Aboa, Samuel Aboa. - Rosa, shut up!
she was going to meet him to leave me.
where were you gonna meet him?
where were you going?! - I don't know.
how do you know him? You work for him?
no.
do you work for him? - No.
you know what he's doing here in this country?
do you have any idea...
what this man is?
he's everything to me.
Nurse...? - Mitchell.
nurse Mitchell, I'd like to see my husband.
ma'am, I... I don't know if that's possible.
I was told that Dr. Schulman will be doing the surgery.
where is he?
excuse me, Madame President.
I'm Lee Schulman, your husband's surgeon.
if you come with me, you can see him now, - but you'll need to keep it brief. - Thank you.
you should know that Mr. Taylor's looking at a minimum of five hours in surgery.
the bullet lacerated his pulmonary artery and lodged in his thoracic region.
he's also suffered massive internal bleeding.
can you offer any kind of prognosis?
I'm a blunt woman, Dr. Schulman. I appreciates bluntness.
his chances aren't good, ma'am.
but I'll do everything I can.
if you'll excuse me. I need to scrub up now.
darling, can you hear me?
Yes, sweetheart.
I'm here.
I'm so sorry I didn't listen to you about Roger.
you were right.
it wasn't suicide.
I know that now. You were always right.
he was a hero. - Yes.
he was, and so are you.
I'm sorry, Madame President, but the anesthesiologist is ready now.
Mr. Buchanan?
Yes, Madame President?
there's something I need you to do for me.
have someone find my daughter Olivia and bring her to me.
have you had a chance to tell her?
my daughter and I haven't spoken for some time, Mr. Buchanan.
she'd never get on the phone with me.
she works for a consulting firm-- Martling/Norris.
?? Do have someone trustworthy you can send?
Yes, ma'am.
I believe I do.
and here he is again in the uniform of the Presidential Guard at the gates of the notorious Mukatu prison.
and here, inside the soccer stadium after the Barakar Massacre.
the event that earned him the nickname The Butcher of Sangala.
Oh, please. No more.
what did you say his real name was again?
I've seen firsthand what he's capable of.
I was in Africa a few months ago.
he was responsible for murdering a friend of mine.
Oh, God.
I know this is a shock.
and I'm sorry.
I really am. But here's the situation.
we need your help, and we need it now.
what kind of help?
we need to put this man in custody before he can leave the country.
well, she already told you. She doesn't know where he is.
Yeah, but you said earlier that you were going to meet him.
where?
he didn't say.
just told me to go home and pack and wait for his call.
give me your phone.
Why?
when he calls, I want you to answer it.
no. No, no. I can't. I can't. - Yes, you can.
listen to me. Just... Just-Just listen to me.
it's-it's over.
the man you thought you knew, the man you had feelings for
he doesn't exist.
all you've been left with are his lies and his betrayal.
is that him?
Marika, please.
all I want you to do is answer the phone and talk to him so that we can find out where he wants to meet you.
please. You can do this.
please just try.
hello.
Marika? - Yes.
are you all right? - I'm fine.
what took you so long to answer the phone?
I was in the bedroom packing.
where are you?
what's wrong?
you sound strange.
it's... It was Rosa. She caught me packing, and we argued.
is she going to be a problem for us? - No.
I'm sorry, Samuel. I had to tell her everything.
it was the only way.
but, uh... but she understands now.
are you certain?
Yeah. Yeah, she's fine.
now that she knows she and I will be together again in a few days.
she should thank heaven she has such an angel for a sister.
are you ready to go?
almost. - Hurry up then.
I've had a car sent for you.
it should be there very shortly. Go downstairs and wait for it.
where is it taking me?
don't worry. The driver will know.
I just want the woman I love to get downstairs as quickly as possible.
okay.
it's all right. It's all right.
you did great.
did we get the rendezvous point?
no. He's sending a car with a driver.
come here.
there's no one on the street yet.
we could grab the driver, get him to tell us Dubaku's location.
there's no guarantee we can get him to talk.
and if we take too long, Dubaku's not gonna wait around.
so then what do we do?
we can get her to go meet with him.
what? - We could track her.
we could use her cell phone as a transponder.
you want to send that girl to Dubaku? - We don't have another choice.
Jack. - You want to get Dubaku, this is our shot.
I have a favor to ask of you.
we can't make you do this.
but when the car arrives, we would like you to go with the driver so that we could follow you back to Dubaku.
what-what are you talking about?
you want her to go to him and face him?
it's the only chance we have of finding him before he disappears forever.
I'll do it.
I'll do it. - No!
I'm your older sister, and I won't allow it.
it's not your decision to make, Rosa. It's mine.
and it's the right thing to do.
let me see your phone.
what are you doing?
getting your SID number.
it's how we're going to track you.
you're not gonna be out there alone.
agent Walker and I will be following you. We'll never be more than a mile behind.
as soon as you reach the destination
that's when we'll move in.
a mile! Are you crazy?
Rosa, enough.
you heard what he said. He's a murderer!
he could hurt you. - He won't.
Rosa, I should have listened to you.
sweetheart.
you warned me about him.
listen, the only reason why I said those things was because I was jealous.
and I didn't want to lose you.
Larry, it's Jack.
Renee said you had someone running operations support?
Yeah. She's right here. I'll put you on speaker.
Jack, it's Chloe.
Chloe. - What do you need?
how long's it gonna take you to set up a SAT beacon for a mobile line?
usually a few seconds, but with the backward way they have the system set up, it's gonna take at least a few minutes.
okay, well, let me give you the SID number.
you got it?
got it.
Jack, who are you tracking?
a woman who's involved with Dubaku.
he's sending a car to take her to him.
she's one of his operatives?
No??
??
???
Arthur, you're not going to find another firm that's done more high-level consulting work for a relatively small pharmaceutical company like yours.
remember, my firm helped the governor craft a plan to swap property taxes for sales taxes in his last budget reform.
tell me that didn't save Dexter-Carr a bundle.
Oh, it did, Olivia.
but since I'm specifically looking to hire you,
I need to know what you yourself can do.
whatever you need.
you know my accomplishments, you've seen my resume.
I mean White House influence.
considering your family.
we're not lobbyists, Arthur.
it states that clearly in the contract.
I just thought, since you had the president's ear...
I don't.
is that going to be a problem?
excuse me, Ms. Taylor?
do I know you?
my name is Aaron Pierce.
your office told me you'd be here.
I've been dispatched at the request of the president.
your credentials say you've retired, Mr. Pierce.
perhaps no one informed you I refused Secr Service protection months ago.
I'm aware of that, ma'am. This is a special circumstance.
well, as you can see, I'm a little busy right now.
this isn't a good time. - I'm sorry, but I have to insist.
it's really... It's all right. - No.
no, it's not all right.
what is it that's so important for my mother to steal me away - while I'm trying to do business? - I'm not at liberty to say, ma'am.
that information is confidential.
Olivia, we can pick this up at a later time.
Arthur, wait... - We'll be in touch.
ma'am, please?
I'm not going anywhere with you until you tell me what this is about.
it's your father, Ms. Taylor.
he's been shot.
he's in surgery at West Arlington Hospital.
your mother's there now.
none of this is public knowledge.
my God, I...
my car is just outside.
excuse me, Sean.
can I please get the digital beta key for t server???
Why?
Larry asked for it.
something to do with the firewall assessment.
if Larry wants it, why doesn't he come to me?
I don't know.
maybe I ought to go ask him. - No.
okay.
I think that Larry brought in this woman, Chloe O'Brian, to replace me.
and I just want to get a bead on what they're working on.
that's all.
that's all? That's enough to lose us both our jobs.
well, maybe I should stop covering for you.
what are you talking about?
Erika and you, and your little sexual indiscretions.
I've said nothing to Larry or your wife.
I'm sure you'd like me to keep it that way.
you're a little bitch, you know that? - You're a little bitch.
okay, Jack. The link's up, I've got the signal.
copy that. I'll get back to you.
we're on.
we got to go.
you
FBI.
you keep her safe, you hear me?
we will.
I'm really scared. - You're going to be fine.
just remember, we're right behind you.
move up here.
now, listen, if you get into trouble, you can signal us by dialing one-zero...
no. No, I don't want you to do that.
don't do anything that's going to raise the suspicion of the driver.
okay.
you ready?
I'm ready. Yeah. - Okay.
what the hell are you doing?
she was scared.
I wanted her to know there was another option than waiting for us to swoop in.
if we're going to find Dubaku, there are no other options, you understand?
come on, you've run operations like this.
not without full tactical support, and at least two backup units on the scene.
she's naked out there, Jack. I don't like it.
this isn't about you.
this is about her and Dubaku.
listen, life gets ugly, innocent people get hurt
that's a reality.
at least she got to make a choice to be involved, to do the right thing.
which is a lot more than I can say for Dubaku's other victims.
we have one job here
that's to get Dubaku.
outside of that don't get involved.
Chloe, the car's here.
copy that.
she's getting in the car.
copy.
she's moving. Are you locked in?
Yeah, I've got the heading south on 14th.
can you upload the tracking grid to Agent Walker's PDA?
no, I'll have to direct you.
just keep us close. - Understood.
head towards 14th, make a right. - ??
??
how much further?
continuing west on R Street, crossing Hampshire Avenue.
you're less than a mile behind the target car.
copy that.
target car is turning, left on Connecticut.
okay, rounding Dupont Circle.
agent Moss, is there anything in the northern quad of the grid that would indicate where Dubaku can hide a plane or a helicopter?
no. Nothing definitive. Could be any number of launch sites.
what was it? What happened?
Jack, we've got a problem.
Chloe, what's wrong?
we just lost the tracking grid.
What?! - I-I don't know.
it just suddenly glitched out.
we can't afford to lose them.
Jack, I gave this woman my word we'd protect her.
I know. Chloe, get it back up. - We're doing our best, here, Jack.
wait.
it's back up.
what the hell happened?
I don't know, I'm running a diagnostic right now.
Jack, they're moving southeast on Massachusetts Avenue.
you've closed the gap to about a half mile.
you may want to back off a little bit.
okay, copy that.
Oh, no.
what?
somebody was in the system.
what? What are you talking about?
I'm saying someone in this office was mirroring my terminal.
whoever it was knows exactly what we were doing.
can you backtrace the breach?
no. The link was severed. It could have come from anywhere.
Jack, you getting this?
it looks like we might have a security breach.
someone is mirroring our comm.
Jack, they're coming from all sides.
Larry, we got a situation here. - What's going on?
I got Metro PDS trying to build a roadblock around us.
what?
why would they be doing that?
I don't know. Just get 'em off us!
Larry, do something!
this is Agent Moss. Connect me with Metro District Command.
hands in the air! Hands in the air!
my name is Jack Bauer, - ??
my passenger is a Federal Agent. - Get out of the car right now!
?? - She's a federal agent!
??
put your hands behind your back, sir.
come on, Larry, do something!
captain, you've got to release these people immediately!
no. No, that is a mistake.
no Federal warrants have been issued for them!
Yes, they have. A warrant was called in for the vehicle.
occupants armed and dangerous, to be apprehended with decisive force.
issued by whom? - FBI. This office.
there's no attribution, but the routing code's real.
this was definitely done by someone here.
Marika's car just turned east onto N Street.
captain, listen carefully.
I'm the Special Agent in charge of this operation, and I am revoking these warrants immediately.
no.
no, I don't have time to deal with your chain of command.
you need to release these people right now!
Hey. Thank you.
so is O'Brian here to replace you?
I don't know. No.
Larry's using her for some kind of covert operation with Jack Bauer.
they're tracking a car to Dubaku.
why would he keep us in the dark about something like that?
I don't know. I don't know, but I don't like it.
Hey, I took care of Bauer and Walker. They're pinned down.
why am I being brought in on this so last minute?
moss is running this operation on his own.
it took me some time to tap into his phone line.
he's on with Metro right now.
can you at least disable the tracking signal they're using to follow the girl?
no, not from my console.
but judging by the frequency, they're using her cell as the tracker.
all right.
good work.
you told me that once Dubaku served his purpose, you'd take him out.
why are we still helping him?
he's threatening to expose us using the database he's kept with names and accounts of everyone involved.
including mine?
I mean, everyone.
we don't know where the file is, so you just better pray that he gets away.
Yes, it has to do with the terrorist threats that happened this morning.
Hello?
you got a problem.
what is it?
your girlfriend's been turned by the FBI.
I don't believe you.
they met with her a half hour ago, told her who you really are.
that's impossible. Marika would never do this.
I got it from our source inside the Bureau, it is definite.
she agreed to lead them to you, using her cell phone as a tracker.
look, my source managed to stall their surveillance team for a while, but you need to get to the airfield immediately.
I'll call my driver, have him take care of her.
no. I'll do it.
Colonel, I told you, they are tracking her.
if you let her come to you, you're risking your chances of escape.
I said, I'll take care of her!
put down your weapon. Now!
what the hell's going on?
Where's Ryan Burnett? What?
senator Mayer's chief of staff - where is he?
Tony double-backed to one of his contacts who gave him information of a second attack.
it's gonna take place here in Washington within the hour.
Juma's operatives are carrying it out.
Burnett's been supporting them all along.
he knows where the attack's gonna take place, so you can either tell me where he is, or I will find him myself.
Mr. Burnett, you are a traitor and a terrorist.
I am not.
I love my country.
Mr. Bauer, this is President Taylor.
Where's the target?!
what you're doing is against the law, Mr. Bauer.
I am ordering you to stand down.
Where's...?
take Mr. Bauer away. He's under arrest.
you should have come to me.
you should have presented your case.
and would it really have made a difference, ma'am?
Colonel Dubaku is dead.
laurent must never know about this, or about his father's cowardice.
there is no sign of my father.
let me take his place on the assault team.
spoken like a true Dubaku.
Laurent, it is time for us to go.
this is it, Larry, no question.
they're moving out.
any idea what the next target is?
no.
from our location, it is approximately 100 meters to the entrance.
the following takes place between 7: 00 pm and 8: 00 pm
let's move.
that's it. I need to see her right now.
ms. Taylor, the president will see you as soon as she's able.
well, you tell her her daughter is done waiting.
I'm going to the hospital to be with my father.
I think it would be a good idea to talk to your mother before you do that.
the president's orders are that you remain in the White House.
so if I try to leave, you will actually physically restrain me?
Oh, that would never happen, Ms. Taylor, because I know you have too much respect for your mother and her office to ever let things get that far.
well done, Agent.
you've been at this a while.
five administrations, ma'am.
Olivia, your mother asked me to fill you in on what's happening.
well, with all due respect, Ethan, you're the last person she should be sending.
there's about to be another terrorist attack on this city.
that's why she wants you to remain here.
are we talking about more planes going down?
we don't know.
but whatever's going to happen will happen soon.
I'm heading to the Pentagon.
on top of all of this, there's also the invasion to deal with.
so, bear in mind, your mother's under tremendous pressure right now.
it's only a matter of time before the media picks up on the heightened security measures.
I want to issue a statement before that happens.
play down the actual likelihood of an attack, talk about the security measures as being due diligence, rather than...
no, Meredith.
the public deserves the truth.
we stress caution and calm, but we acknowledge we have intel about another terrorist action.
Yes, ma'am. Angela and I will have something for you as soon as possible.
madam President, Larry Moss is calling in.
he says he's got a lead on the attack.
put him through.
agent Moss, you're on with the president.
madam President, we've discovered what we believe was a staging area being used by terrorists on the south shore of the Potomac, near the ITP rail and shipyards.
madam President, we've identified one of the men as General Juma.
What?!
Juma's in DC?
Yes, ma'am, and we know that there are at least a dozen other men involved in the attack, and they are armed for a small war.
have you found evidence that tells us where the target might be?
no, ma'am, but we have search teams out looking for the men, and we're hoping that Agent Walker has more information.
she's the one who I. D.'d Juma, but, uh, we've lost contact with her.
lost contact?
Yes, Madam President, but we have every reason to hope that she's still alive and in pursuit of the terrorists.
if she's out there, ma'am, we'll find her.
hold it right there!
I'm Agent Renee Walker, FBI.
agent Walker, we just got an alert on you. You need to call Larry Moss at FBI right now.
tell him there's gonna be a terrorist attack on the White House.
Yes, ma'am. I'll call it in right away. This is Thompson...
man Ranger Thompson, please respond and report your location.
ranger Thompson...
the attorney general wants you transferred to his custody so he can file criminal charges.
have we learned anything else about the attack?
I reached Tony.
he couldn't get any more information from his guy.
according to the FBI, Renee Walker followed a lead on her own to an abandoned warehouse on the Potomac.
got a visual on a heavily-armed commando unit led by Juma himself.
but she went missing right after she called it in.
what do you mean, missing?
we're not sure.
the FBI's searching the area, but there's no sign of her, or any evidence telling us what the target might be.
Burnett knows.
the president offered him an immunity deal.
he turned it down, hasn't said a word since.
damn it, Bill, he was talking when they stopped me.
put me in a room with him for five minutes, and we can stop this thing from happening.
Jack, even if I was willing to release you, he's being transported to Kennedy Memorial.
you couldn't get access to him.
fine. Then you do it.
you can get access.
I'm not trained in coercive techniques.
this is not a maybe.
Ryan Burnett is an accessory to a terrorist attack.
if you don't do this, people will die.
look, I'm not arguing about what needs to be done.
but I can't do it. I don't do that. It's not me.
that's not good enough. Jack!
damn it, Bill. That's not good enough.
you were the one who told me, people who stand by
they might as well help them plant the bomb.
you can do this.
bill, you have to do this.
I can't, Jack.
I'm sorry.
I can't.
this is it, General.
we're on the other side of the conduit.
are you in position?
Yes, General.
I'll be ready for you.
what was that?
I thought I heard you say something.
just, uh, talking to myself.
Yeah. Hey, I tell you we're having people over on Saturday?
nothing fancy. We're bringing in Chinese.
you think you're gonna make it this time?
Oh. Chinese.
but I was looking forward to Sheila's cooking.
all clear, General.
excellent.
we'll have access in ten seconds.
once we're in, we'll have two minutes until the proximity alarms come back up.
move!
I've accessed the Secret Service tracking grid.
where is she?
right here in the Oval Office.
let's go.
clear.
we will meet resistance, which we must counter quickly.
silently.
we have nine minutes until the next Secret Service roll call.
we must find the president by then.
president is preparing to issue a statement that will clarify that.
Yeah, I'll let you know, as soon as it's ready for release.
let go of the phone.
five minutes until roll call, General.
Juma had your father killed.
what?
listen to me, I know that Dubaku is your father.
Juma's been lying to you.
your father is dead.
my father is alive!
Juma had to make sure that your father didn't talk.
so he sent a man named Udo to murder him.
no. No, I... I don't believe you.
look, I was there when Udo did it.
that's how I found you.
by following him back to the rail car.
general Juma betrayed you.
you are lying. You are lying!
I know the target.
reissued warrants and order for transport, sir.
sorry, Jack.
this way, Mr. Bauer.
it's Larry Moss.
Renee Walker says the target is the White House.
how good is her intel?
firsthand. She says they're getting in via subterranean access.
I'll initiate a lockdown.
you alert CIRG.
this is Bill Buchanan.
I have confirmation the White House is a target of a terrorist attack.
condition red. Repeat:
condition red. Secure the president.
get to your posts.
Jack, I could use your help.
I need to know you'll do exactly as I say.
you have my word.
Where's the president now?
oval Office.
what's the meaning of this? You need to come with us.
the White House is under attack. What?!
madam President, we need to go.
ma'am, we need to go right now.
ms. Taylor.
I've got the president's daughter.
we're on our way to the lockdown.
men are down. There's no safe path out.
we need to secure her in the first floor lockdown.
bill, we're clear.
what the hell is he doing here? He's with me.
madam President, right now, you need all the help you can get.
how is this happening? Where's my daughter?
aaron Pierce is taking her to lockdown as we speak, but we need to move.
agents in zones five, seven and nine, please respond.
five, seven and nine, respond.
I can't reach anyone in the quadrant.
Juma's men are headed straight for us.
they know where she is.
they're tracking her, Bill.
madam President, let me see your tracker.
bill, what's the most direct route to the lockdown? From the east.
I'll head west with the tracker and draw them away.
you go with Jack.
agent Bauer.
this is your house. I'll follow.
we're moving the president to lockdown.
agent Hovis, we've got agents down in multiple quadrants.
we need reinforcements, sir.
copy that. We're on our way to the lockdown now.
let's go.
general.
the president has left the Oval Office.
she's heading down the west corridor.
Udo, take your team that way.
we'll trap her in between us.
we're getting close to the president, sir.
up ahead, around this corner.
the president's tracker, sir.
they know we're here.
they're moving the president to the lockdown.
find her.
take him. We need hostages.
start gathering 'em up.
let's move.
we've engaged hostiles on the way to the lockdown.
we do not have a visual on the president.
we're still two minutes away.
get up!
get up! Get up! Get up!
move it! Come on! Come on, move it! Come on!
aaron, it's Jack. I'm with the president, approaching lockdown. Where are you?
Pierce We're still upstairs, Jack.
move! Move! Please...
hostiles are in control of the area.
looking for a way past them to the lockdown.
copy that. Juma's men are closing on our position.
you're going to have about 30 seconds to get here before I have to seal this door. Understood.
you will not close this door until my daughter gets here. Madam President, right now, your life is the priority, whether you like it or not.
please, step inside.
madam President, are you all right?
aaron, it's Jack.
we're sealed off in the lockdown.
we came under attack. We didn't have a choice.
we couldn't have made it anyway, Jack.
we'll try to find a way out of the building.
copy that, Aaron...
Jack, do you read me?
aaron, it's Jack. Do you copy?
damn it. Juma's cut off our communication.
I need to know that my daughter's safe.
madam President, I can't answer that yet.
general Juma, they brought in reinforcements.
I don't know how much longer we can hold them off from your position.
stand by.
agents are moving in from all directions; we will be heavily outnumbered.
does Secret Service know the president is secured in the lockdown?
the only ones who saw are dead.
put me on to their communications channel.
go ahead, sir.
this is General Juma.
I have the president.
evacuate immediately, or she will die.
I need proof you have the president before I can give that order.
let us speak to her. Who is this?
special Agent Hovis.
agent Hovis, move your men out of the building and beyond the fence line, or I will kill the president.
and her death will be on your head.
agent Hovis?
we're pulling back.
all agents, fall back immediately!
I repeat: All agents fall back.
general, Secret Service is retreating.
they are retreating, General.
all of them?
Yes, sir.
gather all the hostages and bring them here.
lock down the exits. Move. Sir.
confirming Secret Service retreat in western quadrant.
copy, General.
the only reason Secret Service would retreat is if they thought Juma had the president.
but that man, Bauer, said he g t my mother into the lockdown.
Juma's bluffing them.
we need to get out of here and let our people know that as soon as possible so they can retake the building.
get out of here? How? They're everywhere.
move it! Shh!
keep your hands on your head - move it!
go! Move it!
go! Move!
move it! Move!
move it!
come on, move!
move it! Move your feet.
get out here.
move it. Move it.
right here. Keep going.
come on. Move it!
sit down! Sit down! Everyone down!
everyone down!
get down. Down now!
get down! Turn around. Turn around.
can you open it?
Yes.
assuming the specifications Hodges gave us are correct.
how long?
15 minutes.
we confronted them in one of the first floor corridors.
at that point, Juma ordered us to retreat, threatening to kill the president if we didn't comply.
but he never gave a visual confirmation he was holding the president?
no, he didn't, but I felt, at that point, I had no choice but to pull back.
his men were killing civilians and agents.
any idea how many people are still trapped inside?
cross-checking the evacuees with the White House manifest.
so far, it looks like 53.
any Secret Service?
as far as I know, we have no agents left in there still alive.
they'll be prepared to storm the building as soon as the order is given.
Yeah, well, at this point, that order has to be given by the vice president.
what's his status?
secret Service has him en route to a secure location.
all right, let me know as soon as he's locked down.
and Hovis, I need an infrared SAT-SCAN of the building.
highest resolution possible.
got it.
you didn't tell me that Jack was in the White House.
he was under arrest.
being held under guard when the attack took place.
under arrest for what?
he found out an aide to Senator Mayer named Burnett was part of the conspiracy.
he was caught torturing him...
in the White House.
almost killed the man before he was stopped.
Renee, the president is our priority, not Jack Bauer.
are we clear on that? Clear.
are you sure? Yes.
they're bringing in more hostages.
get down! Now!
get in here! Sit!
no talking.
I don't see Olivia.
madam President, that's good news.
I know Aaron Pierce.
he will do everything in his power to make sure that your daughter is safe.
this is the White House, for God's sake.
how is it possible that they were able to get around our security protocols?
there's only one explanation.
they had help on the inside.
from whom?
Oh, this is insane.
Juma must realize that there's no way for him to get out of this alive.
I'm afraid he does.
this is his endgame.
he came here to make a statement, and he's willing to die for it.
as soon as the rescue teams realize that you're secure, they'll move in.
it's only a matter of time.
what's he doing?
is that some kind of explosive? No.
Mr. Bauer?
Oh, my God.
they've got the access codes.
I need to get into that panel.
is there something I can do?
Yeah, give me that toolbox over there.
put it on the table.
damn it.
madam President, plug the cord into the wall, please.
now.
okay.
general.
what's wrong?
it just went dead.
somehow, they must have disabled the circuitry from inside.
then, we'll use C4 to blow open the door.
we'll have to drill sinkholes into each of the 11 locking rods.
it will take too long.
depending on how the steel is hardened,
c4 might not even work.
then we'll find another way.
there can be no room for doubt.
we have the president trapped.
we open up that door, we become a part of history.
we will find another way.
Yes.
just a moment.
call came in on the dedicated uplink.
I heard it.
it's him, sir.
put him on speaker.
general, didn't expect to be hearing from you directly.
what is it I can do for you?
we have a problem.
the president is secured in the lockdown.
well, we prepared you for that possibility.
we gave you the specs for the locking mechanism.
they shorted the lock out from the inside.
I need you to find me another way in.
general, I've given you everything I have to give.
my part in this thing is over.
are you forgetting that you don't have the shipment yet?
now, General, I expect you to be an honorable man.
we made a deal.
we held up our end of the bargain.
we got you in the White House.
I expect you to hold up yours.
I don't care about your expectations.
you help me, or I will destroy that shipment before it ever arrives to you.
hang on.
well...
seaton, what do you think?
can he do what he says?
the shipment's not due in the port for another two hours.
his men will have plenty of time to destroy it, render it useless.
general?
tell me - who else is in the lockdown with the president?
my men saw her enter with another man.
well, I'm looking at the White House manifest, and according to this, Olivia Taylor is presently in the building with you.
the president's daughter?
are you sure?
their system logs everyone in and out electronically.
if it says that she's in there, she's in there.
now, you find Olivia Taylor, and you'll get the president to open that door.
your shipment will arrive as planned.
thank you.
there, you see - stress.
stress...
is the fertilizer of creativity.
let's play some darts.
the president's daughter is somewhere in the White House.
let's find her.
raise your heads.
show me your faces.
what do you think's going on?
I asked you a question,
Mr. Buchanan.
you think I made the wrong call with Bauer.
you think that if I'd signed off on him torturing Ryan Burnett, all of this could have been avoided?
you don't know what I'm thinking, Senator.
she's not here.
go ahead and find her and bring her to me.
what happened?
what did you see? The door's guarded.
well, there's got to be another way out.
there are only three exits to this wing, and they're all covered.
the windows are sealed and hardened.
unbreakable. We have to let them know the terrorists are bluffing; that they don't have my mother.
our only option is to get a signal out.
we can do it from the windows of the residence. Okay, okay, good.
you'll be safer if I leave you in a secure area.
I'll get the signal out and come back for you.
I'm not gonna sit and hide in some damn vent, Agent Pierce.
ma'am, it is a long way, and we're probably gonna encounter more of Juma's men.
it's too dangerous.
I don't care.
I'm going with you, and don't try to argue.
we don't have the time.
okay.
stay behind me.
agent Moss, SAT-SCAN's all set up here.
we can see the cluster of hostages, but not the individual bodies.
that the best they can do?
they can't boost the resolution on this? No, sir.
the White House is one of the most heavily shielded buildings in the world.
Yeah, got it.
the vice president's ready.
they're initiating communication. Thanks.
Yeah.
give us the room.
you're on with the Vice President.
Mr. Vice President, I'm Special Agent Moss, head of the FBI's DC branch.
this is Agent Walker.
I've been briefed on the general situation.
what are the latest facts on the ground?
there's nothing further from General Juma, but an infrared scan of the building shows he's holding the hostages in a hallway outside the Roosevelt Room.
now this is very possibly good news for the president.
explain.
the area's not one of the more defensible places in the building.
tactically, it makes no sense for Juma to have chosen it as a base.
however, the area is adjacent to the ground floor lockdown, which we know the president was en route to.
so, you think the president made it into the lockdown?
that's our best explanation for him being there.
we're therefore are asking you to authorize the rescue operation before Juma manages to penetrate the lockdown.
do you have any other evidence that supports your theory that the president is in the lockdown?
there's the fact that he couldn't produce the president when we asked him to prove that he had her.
couldn't or wouldn't?
you can't be certain which one it is, can you?
Certainty's not possible in this case, sir.
we're giving you our best estimation and we urge you to allow us to launch.
what if you're wrong?
what if Juma does have the president?
he will kill her as soon as he realizes what you're doing.
inaction has its own risks, too, sir.
the more time Juma has to reinforce his position, the more difficult it'll be to take the building and to save lives.
I understand.
but my priority must be the president's life.
prudence dictatesthat I hold off on authorizing the rescue operation until we can be more certain of her status.
Mr. Vice President, terrorists are in control of the White House.
I would ask you to consider if prudence is the appropriate response in this situation.
I thank you for your thoughts, Agent Walker.
until you can provide me with more intel on what's going on in there, you are instructed to refrain from launching any action.
keep me apprised of any further developments.
all he's interested in is covering his own ass.
he's the Vice President.
right now, he's calling the shots.
it was the right call, sir.
you can't order an operation that results in the president's death and your own elevation to the job.
it would be politically untenable.
never let anyone hear you talking like that, Derek.
understood?
Yes, sir.
Oh, God...
Oh, my God, Aaron!
they would've heard those shots, so you're going to need to get the signal out before they get back.
there's a security kit behind that door in the bureau.
it's got first aid and a flashlight.
you'll flash Morse Code out the window.
reach in my jacket. I got a pen.
here.
give it to me.
give me your hand.
this is called "Code Green.
a dot is a short blink; a dash is a long one.
code Green" will signal them to move in.
go!
okay... okay...
okay...
okay.
okay. Okay.
general Juma,
I have the president's daughter.
bring him.
woman Sources have confirmed that the siege inside the White House began approximately 40 minutes ago.
we do not yet have confirmation on the number of hostages being held, or if the president is among them.
behind me, you can see dozens of tactical assault units standing by.
government analysts tell us the order to launch any operation in these circumstances would rest with the vice president.
general, I discovered fiber-optic cameras embedded in the chandelier.
Sit!
get me a chair.
Yes, General.
he spotted the cameras.
give me a secure channel.
go ahead, sir.
president Taylor,
I see now that you've been watching us.
good.
there is something I think you should see.
God, no.
if you don't open the door,
I'm going to cut out your daughter's eyes one by one.
and then I'm going to cut out her tongue...
...and then her head.
mom, don't listen!
I know what you're thinking.
how do you know if you open the door that I won't kill her?
all you need to know is that I most certainly will kill her if you don't.
open the door.
madam President, I can't! No. Open the door.
open the door! I can't!
that is my daughter out there.
do you understand?
I've already lost my son.
have you any idea what it's like to lose a child?
 Madam President, I am genuinely sorry, but I cannot let them take you.
there is nothing you can do for her now.
do you have children, Jack?
I have a daughter.
could you do what you're asking me to do?
just stand by and watch her butchered?
no, ma'am.
but I am not the President of the United States.
well, I am the president.
and I am ordering you to open that door.
you're running out of time.
mom...
perhaps this will make your mother decide more quickly.
mom, you shouldn't have...
I wouldn't let them hurt you, darling.
damn it, Bauer.
what have you done?!
all right, General, you've got me now.
there's no reason to hold anyone else.
let them go.
you...
don't give orders to me.
get the camera ready for her statement.
what statement?
the last one you'll ever give.
Mr. Knowles, my name is jack bauer.
Jonas hodges is in possession Of a military-Grade bioweapon.
I was contaminated when trying to intercept the canisters.
I promise you, sir, The weapon is on your base.
do you have any idea Where they might be? - Think i might.
I have an order from the president of the united states.
to search this building. Are there weapons of mass destruction?
are there weapons of any kind?
you've got five minutes To get these helicopters flying out of here
with all of you on board.
Larry, i want you and your men To pull out on hodges' timetable.
Tony, you're gonna need to find a way to stay behind.
we're gonna get your vectors over to a man That we contacted inside starkwood.
his name is douglas knowles.
he believes he knows where the weapons are.
stay here. I'll be right back.
we need a medic!
the bioagent is more virulent than we thought.
all we're doing here is just masking The symptoms.
I understand.
there's something you may want to consider. - What's that?
a possible treatment using stem cells From a genetically compatible donor.
I saw your file, and it says You have a daughter.
I don't want my daughter involved in this.
??? It should be her choice.
well, it's not. I'm the one who's dying.
I'm in. But they got knowles.
a little loyalty.
wasn't that the least i deserved?
you can't take on the federal government.
I have a visual on the weapon.
okay, those are the canisters.
I'll notify admiral smith the rget is located and confirmed.
you remember starkwood was deployed to pakistan,
that we requisitioned a missile system at that time.
well, three of those missiles Are now loaded with a pathogen
and aimed at cities on our eastern seaboard.
you will keep this conversation to yourself And turn the planes around.
and if you do not comply, madam president,
I will have no choice
but to launch those missiles.
abort the air strike, admiral smith.
ma'am, with all respect...
damn it, admiral. Abort the air strike immediately!
the following??? 1: 00 and 2: 00 A. M.
Tony, it's jack. Do you copy?
Jack, what the hell is going on?
where are those f-18s?
tim woods just called from the white house.
the president canceled the air strike.
what? Why?
she doesn't believe our intel Is strong enough to justify military action.
is she out of her mind?
Jack, i saw those canisters with my own eyes.
so did you. They're in that bunker.
she's not gonna get any better intel than that.
