tepco has started paying "condolence money" to those affected in the fukushima region where the plant is based.
tepco hopes to create a closed-loop system for the water, which would be cooled by newly installed fan units and then fed back into the reactor.
tepco in 2002 admitted to falsifying data, including safety tests, dating back to the early 1990s and including records at the fukushima plant.
tepco is also to begin tests to determine whether the spraying of special paint on the rubble resulting from the blasts at the plant would prevent radioactive substances being carried into the atmosphere.

tepco officials have been pumping seawater with boron in a last-ditch effort to bring temperatures down to prevent an outright meltdown.
tepco on tuesday said it had reconnected power to all six of its daiichi reactors in an effort to restore normal cooling operations.
tepco on tuesday said revenues declined 7 per cent in the april-to-june quarter compared with a year earlier, as capacity shortages in the wake of the fukushima disaster prompted its customers to reduce consumption.
tepco replaced the pump, and normal cooling operations resumed by thursday afternoon.
tepco said cooling systems at the no. 5 and no. 6 reactors were working, offering a boost to recovery efforts.
tepco said it did not know why the water had such high levels of radioactive substances but said it could not deny that the fuel rod might have broken.
tepco said it had not made significant alterations to its timeline.
tepco said it managed to get temperatures at the waste fuel storage pools at reactors no. 5 and no. 6 close to regular temperatures, kyodo news reported sunday morning.
tepco said reactors 5 and 6 had been cooled to safe levels after a second of their shared diesel generators was repaired, allowing electrical power to be restored to internal cooling systems.
tepco said sunday the radiation level at reactor no.3 fell to 2758 microsieverts per hour sunday morning, compared with 3443 microsieverts saturday morning, after hours of dousing it with water.
tepco said the condenser, which dated from the plant's construction, worked after the quake but eventually stopped.
tepco said the radiation level at reactor no.3 fell to 2758 microsieverts at 1840 gmt saturday, compared with 3443 microsieverts at 0500 gmt, after hours of dousing it with water.
tepco said the two workers died about an hour after the earthquake, most likely from injuries sustained at the time of the disaster.

tepco spokesman Daisuke Tanaka has offered to resign today.
tepco submitted the report on its plan for fukushima daiichi in 2002.
tepco was able to reduce the temperature and pressure inside the reactor, the nuclear-safety agency said.
tepco was considering sending in workers to open vent valves by hand, mr. muto said, but radiation levels near the reactor were already so high that executives weren't sure they wanted to do that.
tepco will be primarily responsible for compensation to some affected by the food contamination, because it is the result of problems with the nuclear reactor, mr. edano said.
tepco workers couldn't hook the generators to the plant's damaged main switches.
tepco wrongly measured radiated waters in one of the turbine halls at 10m times normal level, rather than the still-alarming 1 00000 times.
tepco's attempt to impart information has left the public mostly confused and incredulous.
tepco's loss of power generation about one-quarter of its normal output is already having a profound effect, even before the intensely hot summer months when demand surges.
tepco's off-site emergency response headquarters for example, was housed in a building that "was not designed to withstand elevated radiation levels, although it was intended for use in nuclear emergencies," and did not even have air cleaning filters, it says.
tepco's own salaried staff are in a minority.
tepco's share price fell sharply.
tepco, the tokyo regional power company, has been able to bring online more power plants than it anticipated initially.
tepco, whose share price has fallen 90% since the 11 march tsunami crippled the fukushima daiichi plant, promised to make repayments as quickly as possible.
