all right, but one thing is clear. I come to this bar,
all right, but only 'cause we're talking guy to guy. Right.
all right, but only 'cause you're not funny and I'm taking pity on you.
all right, but only because I like earth.
all right, but payback is not the answer.
all right, but promise you'll be careful.
all right, but remember, I get 10% for negotiating the deal.
all right, but resuscitation is hit or miss.
all right, but save yourself the respirator till the last moment.
