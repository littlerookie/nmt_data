I got Lichtenstein.
come on.
Yeah, you're really...
you're really selling it there, Casey.
is this a joke?
Where's your backup?
I'm just the tip of the spear.
rest of the crew's on their way up.
I've been following these grifters for months now.
you know, if you gentlemen would be willing to testify,
I'm sure we can get the weapons charges dropped, hmm?
drop it!
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
you lower your weapon, or I will kill your father.
if I did that to him, imagine what I'll do to you.
drop your weapon!
Amad's getting away.
not at 22 miles an hour he's not.
all clear.
dad.
Yeah, thanks.
little rough with the cuffs, though.
call it in.
you didn't use blanks?
what's wrong with you people?
it's just a flesh wound.
I'd like to report a stolen '81 DeLorean.
license plate is D- E-M-O-R-G-A-N.
no, this is...
this is not...this is not a prank call.
thanks to your efforts, we were able to freeze nearly a billion dollars of the sheik's foreign accounts.
well done.
general.
now, to the unpleasant news.
agent Walker, we're sending a unit to your hotel to pick up your father for the previous embezzlement charge at 5: 00 today.
say your good-byes. That's all.
general?
as you know, Mr. Burton was invaluable in the seizure of these funds.
perhaps that could lessen his prison sentence.
prosecution will be made aware of that.
thank you.
you're not going to believe this.
the police just called.
the DeLorean was stolen.
Morgan, I've been meaning to tell you...
dude, do you know what that means?
they have to impound the car.
I'm gonna get Blue Book value.
I'll pay back Awesome, and I'll still have ten large!
dude, I'm rich!
we're rich.
now, we can move in together in style.
I am doing the whole living room in shabby chic.
love you. -Love you.
kiss. Kiss.
yummy kisses.
well, you have to grow up sometimes, you know?
the right girl, the right time.
I'm proud of you, buddy.
thank you.
dude, you're not gonna believe what just showed up in the Audio Install.
Morgan, no!
no. -Yes.
do not...
well, it couldn't hurt to look, you know...
boy, lucky you're a good shot.
but a good con man doesn't need a gun, and he can leave...
leave town whenever he wants.
I know.
uh, Dad, can you get me some Rocky Road?
there's a store around the corner.
sure thing, darling.
why did you put the money in Chuck's account?
I need to put it somewhere 'cause I didn't trust Cop Face.
but you trusted Chuck?
I read people. That's the only real talent I got.
one thing I know--that kid would never betray you.
I made a $10 million bet that he loved you.
turns out I was right.
I'll be back in a minute.
uh, dad?
can you make it a double scoop?
sure, darling.
Hello, Charlie.
I've kind of grown accustomed to Schnook.
so have I.
I, uh...
I wanted to thank you for coming back when I gave you ten million reasons to leave.
but one really good reason to stay.
and she would have done the same for me.
Yeah, I believe she would have.
lucky for me, she met the right schnook.
he went over there...
my daughter is some kind of cop, isn't she?
Yeah.
something likes that.
she turned out pretty good.
even with a lousy father.
take care of her.
I'll do my best.
you okay?
I'm fine.
here.
he'll be back soon.
no, he won't.
Hi. Joshua Gomez. Welcome to Chuck.
do me a favor. Put on your 3-D glasses right now.
Wow! That's cool. That is pretty amazing stuff.
Chuck, wake up.
Sarah, what are...?
what are you doing here?
Oh. Okay, uh, Sarah? - Yes, Chuck?
this is a dream. - No, it isn't.
come on. Who are we... Who are we kidding here, huh?
this is... This is clearly my-my subconscious at work.
and on behalf of my conscious self, I'd-I'd like to apologize.
I'm normally much more respectful of women even in my dreams.
it's just that, you know, anxiety and fear can-can really, um...affect your dream life.
and what are you afraid of?
I watched you kill that FULCRUM agent in cold blood.
Sarah, I am... I am not like you, okay?
I might have all these government secrets in my brain, but that does not make me a real spy.
I need to tell you this in reality, not in my dream.
this isn't a dream. - Oh, what is it?
it's a nightmare.
that's not the way that dream was supposed to go.
Chuck, are you okay?
I'm fine. I'm absolutely 100% on it. Why?
dude, you were totally screaming last night. Like a little girl.
honey. - It was crazy how high it was.
I'm sorry about that, but, yeah, I'm fine.
bro, you're a tense coil of stressed-out negativity. We don't mean to pry, but...
actually, we do. We do.
what's stressing you out?
nothing... particular. You know, it's a little hectic at work and stuff.
Wow. I didn't realize life got so hectic at the Buy More.
well, Chuck, maybe what you need is a day off.
good prescription, babe. Chuck, that's exactly what you need.
you need to blow off some steam, have some fun.
take a day off, Chuck.
dude, we got the day off.
what? What? What is... What is going on?
Tyler Martin is coming here.
Tyler Martin? The Tyler Martin? Rock star Tyler Martin?
rock star, legend, poet.
have you seen it? - No.
well, anyway, Big Mike heard about it, and offered them our store.
thank you, Big Mike. - That's what I'm saying.
dude, this place is gonna be so packed to the gills, no one's even gonna notice that we're doing diddly squat.
Grimes! Over here now!
have fun.
Grimes, got a job for you.
old football buddy of mine, Jimmy Butterman, just got paroled.
I told his PO that we'd give him a job here at Buy More so he could get back on his feet.
an ex-con, sir? I- I just... Is that such a good idea?
he's a teammate, Grimes. Teach him everything you know.
I will.
when you say prison, though, are you talking, like, bars and-and guards and, uh, showers?
get out! - Get out. Getting... Okay.
attention.
attention!
Oh, thank you.
ladies and gentlemen, when my personal friend, Mr. Martin, enters the store, there is to be no flash photography...
no approaching of Mr. Martin of any kind, and most importantly, no touching!
consider yourself warned.
Sarah, Casey, there's a situation in the Buy More. There is a guy with a grenade.
I'm heading toward the store now.
where is he?
he's gone. - Where is the grenade?
go!
don't open it!
it's a grenade.
it's gonna blow anyway, idiot. I'll take it out front.
no, we can't take it out front. There's people out there. We got to take it out the back.
you stay here. - Casey!
Hey, that's my Tyler Martin display. He is a hero of mine, Chuck.
sorry, Lester. Emergency.
nobody treats Lester like that.
Jeff, let go!
throw it.
interception!
why are we playing keep away?
Oh! Come on...
Oh, Grimes. See you've met Mr. Butterman.
the other half of the Defense of Death.
blow it up! - Blow it up!
what did we win?
good morning, Sarah. - No time to diffuse it.
I got an idea.
here.
hold on. Open the door.
get down!
good morning, Chuck.
agent Walker, Mr. Bartowski.
I'm sure you're wondering why would someone want Tyler Martin dead.
not really. I mean, have you heard his music?
it's overly produced, the lyrics are completely banal.
I mean, Facebook even has a group called I Want To Kill Tyler Martin.
not that I'm a member. I wouldn't ever... That's just wrong.
why don't you just share with General Beckman the intel about the grenade that you flashed on?
it was an IG-88 thermite charge.
that's military.
commonly used by North African intelligence units.
interestingly, Tyler Martin recently completed a tour of Africa.
I want you to find out who was behind this attempt and why.
well, the only way to do that is to question Tyler Martin.
then bring him in.
it can't be that hard to get him alone.
all right.
Hello, Cleveland! Yeah.
this is Burbank.
Oh. Whatever.
now, I would like to thank all of the humanitarians that have affected my work.
mother Theresa, Nelson Mandela, God rest his soul.
and my personal favorite, Angelina Jolie.
as a thank you to all my beautiful fans who still buy CDs,
I've included this, a ticket, a golden ticket...
a golden ticket? - Golden ticket!
... inside these. My new CD.
it is a backstage invite to a benefit concert I'm having tomorrow night.
all right, we'll see you later.
that was great, Tyler.
this is gonna be huge for the Tyler Martin brand, you realize that?
how are we supposed to grab a rock star in broad daylight?
I mean, security's crawling all over the place.
this is going to be easy.
What...?
catch you later, Gavin.
what's gonna be easy?
I'm such a fan, Mr. Martin.
I'm a big fan of yours, too.
so, are you, uh, a model, actress?
massage therapist? Maybe a acrobat?
I can be whatever you want.
Ugh!
idiot.
I think we got a pervert.
Oh, daisies.
Nighty-night, Tyler.
how much tranquilizer did you use?
it's a high grade at a heavy dose. Mr. Martin should be out for 12 to 24 hours.
jet lag is brutal.
rock star metabolism.
all the better for seeing you, darling, you know.
I feel like a daffodil.
time for the road trip.
road trip? Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where you going?
the Buy More parking lot camera has a match on the car the suspect drove this morning.
what about Tyler here?
Oh, check his mouth every 20 minutes, make sure he doesn't choke on his own tongue.
hang on a second. You're-you're gonna go, and you want me to stay here and be on tongue watch duty?
well, you don't have plans, do you?
would it be so crazy if I did have plans?
plans that involved something other than fixing a computer or playing hot potato with a thermite grenade?
Yes.
so, what's with Chuck?
the guy's got a point. He hasn't had a day off.
if you ask me, we're lucky he didn't melt down months ago.
no, I think it's something else. He's been acting strange since the holidays.
hold that thought.
we got a real fan boy, huh? - No, no, there's something wrong here.
this is too neat. It's too orderly.
Beckman was right. We're dealing with a pro.
golden ticket's got to be in here somewhere.
I don't know, guys. I mean, you think this is right?
this golden ticket's supposed to be for Tyler Martin fans.
Hey, I am a fan. - So am I.
Yeah, so am I.
so, Mr. Butterman, could you settle a bet? Say it's our first day in prison.
who do you think would be considered the weaker gazelle?
you put anything in my mouth... I will bite down hard.
that's it. - The golden ticket!
Oh, my God, Morgan! - Please, please.
I am so happy for us, buddy. - Please, please.
you don't want me to hurt them. - Fellas...
please.
this ticket only entitles me to a plus one, okay, so we are gonna have to settle this... the Buy More way.
this ticket is Lester's... and... and Butterman's.
What?!
no, hey, hey, excuse me.
this may be the most impressive restroom I've ever seen in my life.
that ceiling looks just like the night sky.
that's because that is the night sky.
have I made a mistake? - No.
better question. Where am I? Who are you?
I'm Chuck, my name is Chuck. And I...I work for the label.
my record label? - Yes, yes, your record label.
there was a death threat against you earlier today, so we thought it might be good to move you to this secure location.
all right, well... I'd better go.
um, um, Mr. Martin, you actually have to stay here for the night.
the night? No, no, no, Jack. - Chuck, actually.
I get death threats all the time, okay?
besides... it's party night.
it's Tuesday. - Exactly. I've got to go.
um, you know what? Hey, hey, how about... I'm just gonna call my bosses real quick.
Chuck, the record company got you this phone, right?
sure.
okay. - Why...
I'll get you a new one.
in case you haven't noticed yet,
I just asked you to party... with me.
come on. Come on.
Yeah. What a night.
you got money, right? 'Cause I don't hold cash.
first, a little liquid nourishment. Then, we'll get onto the heavy drinking.
Oh, um, you know, I'm actually more of a beer guy. Something amber complected?
not tonight, Chuck.
I may be a rum-soaked narcissist, but I am also the best wingman you will ever have.
drink it down, mate.
see you guys in the emergency room!
hello. Gavin, you old slapper.
no, I'm with the rep from the label. Chuck!
never heard of you.
I've never heard of him.
he's never heard of you! No, never mind. See you later.
who's for another drink?
ladies, tonight, all the drinks... on the record company.
to determine who will be the plus one of my golden ticket, we will settle this with Morgan's special triathlon.
first up...
the Molly Ringwald underpants challenge.
the first of you to present to me women's underpants is going to...
I'm a man. For God's sake, I'm a man!
I'm actually going to accept these.
you know, a ticket's not that important to me.
I need some ice.
look, if you're worried about Chuck, I can talk to him, scare him straight.
I'd actually enjoy that. - Uh, no, it's okay. I'll get him under control.
too late.
so I said, "I'll give you the dog for the trousers." That's how I got the trousers.
Hey, Chuck. I'll tell you what you need.
aspirin! - A tattoo.
Oh, no, no, no! I'm not crazy about needles.
ladies love a little bit of ink.
whenever I do something amazing, you know, feed the starving, help the homeless, rescue some emaciated refugee, I map it out here on my body.
how do you know what they all mean?
well, this here means... serenity.
it's not... it could be bliss.
I don't know-Gavin, my manager, sorts it all out.
you know, you got to kind of trust the artist.
are you Tyler Martin? - Yes, I am.
and this here is Chuck. Chuck is in my band.
yeah... yeah, I'm in his band all right.
Drummer- just laying the beats down. Like a little drummer boy.
come, they told me. Pa-rump-a-pum-pum.
you guys want to dance? - Yes.
no. - Yes, we do.
no, I'm not really a dancer, you know?
unless it's, like, some ballet or... but this isn't a ballet place.
you know, I'm much better at ironic dancing.
what happened to your accent?
sorry. I don't really have one.
I don't really care.
round two. The Subway sprint.
there's only one thing you got to ask yourself, Butterman.
do you like succulent chicken oozing with bacon and ranch dressing?
I love succulent chicken. - I am in your head, sir.
let's use this, use this-are you ready?
set.
consume.
Oh, keep it down or you're disqualified.
keep it...
keep it... down.
Atta boy-get to work.
come on, come on.
we have a winner.
winner!
winner.
the signal is weak, but I still have a trace on Chuck. He's somewhere in the club.
Casey, it's him.
damn it, he made me. Go.
Freeze! - Halt!
get on the ground.
you'll want to be more gentle with me.
get your hands up... do it!
I'm going to walk away from you now.
I'd rather we all go up. - Casey, be careful.
then, you should know that Mr. Martin is still in danger.
I have some friends set to meet him.
so, by all means, stay here and die. Or you can go save him.
Casey. We gotta get Chuck- come on.
Chuck! We got a problem.
these girls want to take us upstairs and do despicable things to us.
Tyler, Tyler, that's... that's not such a great idea.
all the best nights of my life have begun with that very sentence.
which brings us to the final leg of our triathlon.
good lord, is that... - Yeah, Butterman, it is.
may I present to you the urinal cake.
okay, here's the deal.
the winner will be the first one of you...
Ah, come on.
dude, seriously, are you kidding me? What is wrong with you?
you were just supposed to touch it.
I still win, right?
all right, who stole the urinal cakes?
I splashed myself silly.
welcome to Castle de Orlando, Spanish conquistador.
so, I think we should maybe just head...
Tyler, Tyler, I need to talk to you, buddy. In a minute, Charles.
no, no, it's very important. I need to talk to you right now.
ladies, I'm so sorry. If you just go make yourself comfortable right inside, then maybe we could have our talk, and then we'll join you in just a second.
how does that sound? - What?
thanks so much. Listen to me very carefully, Tyler.
these women are very, very dangerous.
don't worry. I always use protection. Good looking out.
that's not what I'm talking about. I'm begging you, just once, deny yourself this pleasure.
you're right. That's totally selfish of me.
Oh, good, lets go. - You need this much more than I do.
no, no, Ty, no, I'm not talking about... Please don't, please...
Hey. I'm...
Where's Tyler? - That's an excellent question.
t- Tyler, Tyler just-he stepped away for a second, but he's gonna be right back, I promise.
I guess you'll have to go first.
go first where, go first what? Why- where am I going first?
why do I have to be first? First is the worst, second is the best, and third...!
Oh, h-hi. Oh...
those are my shoes; I need those. I need those shoes, I need those shoes.
I need those-no, those are my pants!
I think that you have overestimated my prowess as, as, as a lover and a man.
just looking at you, I can feel that you require a...a real rock star, so...
what happened to not leaving your wingman?
Sarah. - Where are you?
top floor, Tyler's suite, or more specifically, the roof outside of it.
things have gotten a little out of hand.
this is so romantic. The perfect second honeymoon.
could you push the button for the lobby, please?
no, no, n-no, the lobby, the lobby! Where you going, where you going, where you going?
no, lob-lobby! Don't...
ladies.
ladies, you ready for me?
Tyler, run!
sorry, I must be going.
get 'em, Sarah!
lobby, please.
Chuck, what were you thinking?
you know, I gave you clear instructions to keep him here. And instead you take him to a nightclub?
interesting tactical decision there.
well, time-out, listen, he woke up and I couldn't stop him. Okay,
I don't have a knockout karate chop like you guys. That's not part of my skill set.
where am I?
and how was I?
Mr. Martin, we're with the government. We're here to protect you.
wait, there was an elevator.
Chuck, you were there.
t- Two girls. One of them had a gun. I- It was pointed at me.
Tyler, Tyler, it's all right. Just like Casey said, we're here to protect you.
I need to call my manager.
no, Mr. Martin, I don't think that's a good idea because we don't know who's involved.
I have to call my manager.
good show.
Casey, what is wrong with you?! You can't do that!
you're going to give the guy brain damage or liver problems.
too late on both counts.
I know why they're trying to kill him. I know why they want him dead.
what? - His back, the tattoo on his back.
it's not, it's not Arabic philosophy.
it's actually a very clear message about a private reactor that's being built in North Africa.
his manager is bringing in the tattoo artists.
of course. He's a rock star, he travels the world.
manager is using him to move secrets.
idiot never even knew what the ink meant.
you know what, Casey? You're wrong about Tyler.
he's actually a pretty good guy.
he's an idiot, Bartowski, just like you.
should have never left the two of you alone.
you know, Chuck, Casey is right. I mean, you could have gotten yourself killed.
what exactly were you thinking?
what was I thinking? I'll tell you what I was thinking.
I was thinking like I wasn't a spy. Okay?
I was trying to have a little bit of fun, and I knew the second I called you two, it would all be over.
but Chuck, you are a spy, and you should know better than to put yourself in a dangerous situation where I can't protect you.
is it really so wrong for me to want a night off?
I was having a really goodtime, too, until the assassins stole my pants and tried to kill me.
I've earned it. I deserve it.
I'm losing consciousness.
my ears couldn't take it. Either that or I shoot him.
you ready for a taste of the sweet life tonight, buddy?
Yeah, sure, sure. - Backstage passes.
you know what that means, don't you?
no, I've never been backstage before.
that ticket's our passport to freedom.
not only is there free beer backstage, but there are women that haven't been sober for years, and we're allowed in, so the ladies assume we're not losers.
Wow...it sounds like a fairy tale.
poor Butterman.
the guy's been trapped in an 8x10 cell for years.
he ate when they said "Chow time,
and he slept when they shouted "Lights out!
now look at him. Broken.
the man had a choice of five sodas, a choice we take for granted every day, a choice he's been denied for far too long.
I'm sorry, Jeff, this ticket doesn't belong to us.
this ticket belongs to Butterman.
the man deserves his passport to freedom.
you and I, we're going to give it to him.
I'll make it up to you. I'll buy you a keg.
what do you like? - It's called Beer.
done... - Beer brand.
done.
your flash turned up good intel, Chuck. The man you confronted last night is Achmed Gambir, a top foot soldier in a private army in North Africa.
we've been trying to infiltrate their ranks for years.
I want you to capture Achmed at tonight's concert.
he's the key to bringing down this merc army.
what- w-wait, wait, wait. You want Tyler on stage as bait?
general, Mr. Martin knows there are people after him and he won't go on.
well, then convince him.
wait, no, no.
no, no, guys, hey, this is way too dangerous. Tyler could get killed.
those are nightmares tattooed on his body, Chuck.
we have to take Gambir down tonight.
okay, okay, fine, fine, you go in there and tell him he has to put his life on the line because he was a pawn in someone else's game.
he won't listen to us.
so you want me to do it? No, absolutely not.
what do you mean no? We have orders.
Chuck, what is the matter with you? This is about more than just taking a night off.
maybe. Um, I- you know, I'm a little off my game right now.
I'm not, not really sleeping. I don't want to get into it.
Chuck, lives are on the line right now, and if Tyler doesn't help us, then he will never be free of those people, and if you don't help us, then Achmed Gambir gets away.
and the world becomes a more dangerous place.
I don't know what happened to you, but this is our job
not only to protect Tyler but the country and anybody else who needs protecting.
we do whatever it takes no matter what.
did you forget that?
that I definitely didn't forget.
we don't have time for this.
wait.
I'll do it. I'll convince him.
Hey, man.
you okay?
no. No, I'm not okay.
don't know where I am, how I got here, and someone's trying to kill me.
on the plus side, your friend's tranqs are out of this world.
Yeah, it's one of his few good qualities.
I've never been in a situation like this before, life or death.
pretty much live my life avoiding anything this real.
it takes some getting used to.
what do you want me to do?
we would like for you to perform tonight at your special concert.
that's madness. People are trying to kill me.
Yes, and you can help us catch them.
you can help the world, the entire world, by doing this, for real.
you could go back to living your life again.
one night of bravery for an entire life of normalcy.
I can't even tell you what I'd give for that.
how do I know I can trust them? Your people?
because I do.
they're the best.
I stake my life on it every day.
I got one thing to say.
Hello, Cleveland.
it's Burbank. - Right. I'm dyslexic.
you boys have given me back hope. Thanks.
you deserve a taste of the sweet life, man.
enjoy it for all of us. - Do us proud, Butterman.
Thanks.
there you go.
dude, how could you just sell the golden ticket like that?
sorry, guys. I found out how much these things are going for online.
but your freedom, man. Was it worth the price of freedom?
price of my freedom is 800 bucks.
same as my ticket to Zihuatanejo.
see you never. Enjoy hell.
get busy living, or get busy dying.
true that.
well, back to work.
20 minutes till Tyler Martin takes the stage.
Chuck. - Yeah, I'm here.
don't let Tyler take the stage till we give the okay.
okay. Got it.
Sarah, made the mark. Get on my six and intercept him.
who are you? Why you wearing this?
some guy gave me free tickets.
he just said I had to wear this stupid jacket.
he's ahead of us.
which one is he?
sorry, buddy, No one allowed to see Mr. Martin.
Yeah, you get it, Chuck.
open this door.
it's him. It's him. - Who?
the guy who's trying to kill you?
here? I thought you said we were safe.
I know you're in there, Mr. Martin. - Oh, I need another drink.
that's a good idea.
no, that's- no. No. Hey, get in there. Get in there.
I said open this door! - What about you, Chuck?
I'll be all right. Just, just stay in the closet.
wait. Take off your shirt.
just trust me.
Hey.
Sarah, it's Chuck. - Chuck. What is it?
Achmed. Achmed's right outside the dressing room.
I- I don't know what happened to the guards.
okay, Chuck, stay right where you are. I'm coming.
Sarah, look, I didn't need the night off. You were right, it's something else. I should've told you.
I should have...
Chuck? Chuck, can you hear me?
move. Excuse me. Go!
I think maybe, maybe you have the wrong room.
tell me where he is?
tell you where who is?
Oh! Oh, where-where he is- where Tyler is.
right. He, you know, he-he skipped out. Don't know where he is.
so sorry. I don't know. He's gone.
he's in the closet.
move! Coming through.
okay, you got us. Yeah, worse plan ever. But I know about the tattoo.
I know what it means.
you and your private army enriching uranium, selling it to unstable countries.
using Tyler's manager and his tattoos to pass the info off to your buyers.
you take one more step, I send this e-mail and everyone knows.
proving that the cell is mightier than the sword.
or, or a very large knife, as it might be in this case.
go! Excuse me. Move!
put it down.
put it down!
No! - No!
I can't let you do this for me Chuck.
actually, my plan was working very well.
No! - No!
follow me. - Tyler, what's going on, man?
Gavin, you're fired!
Sarah, we're running to the stage. He's right behind us.
Chuck, are you okay? - Yeah, yeah, just get us out of here.
everybody give it up for Tyler Martin!
Hey!
help.
Hello, Los Angeles.
what do we do now?
jump. - What?
jump.
Chuck! Jump!
it's all good, it's all good, Chuck, relax. Come on, take it easy.
okay, okay.
Stephanie, right? Stephanie. Yeah!
you think I look mad, wait till you see her.
Hey. A little too much to drink there, huh, pal?
uh, let's get you some coffee.
we got him! Ha, ha, ha!
see? I told you they were the best!
Yeah, that's it, all right. Now back to the stage.
come on, I want to sing now.
all right, like he said, back to the stage.
who the hell are you?
Grimes? Where's my boy Butterman?
um, he kind of took off suddenly. - Can't say I blame him.
man's gotta run free after being locked up so long.
Yeah, yeah, well, um, Big Mike, do mind if I ask you what Butterman was in the can for?
I mean, you talking robbery? Drugs? Murder?
Butterman? - Yeah.
God, no!
bank fraud, insider trading. The man's a white-collar criminal.
Why? He take you fools for some money?
he said he was going somewhere. - Zihuatanejo?
that's Mexican for Philadelphia.
I knew I should have learned Spanish.
I can't believe my manager's going to jail.
think about it. No privacy.
it'd be like hell on bloody earth.
Yeah. Tell me about it.
you understand why you're gonna have to get your tattoos removed, right?
Oh, yeah, yeah. I hear you're the broto talk to get more of those tasty tranq darts.
Philistine.
Thanks, Chuck. - Oh, hey, it was nothing.
no, no, it was everything.
you taught me to put people in front of myself.
felt kind of wonderful.
I can strike that off the list now.
if you ever want to party, you know where to come.
Yeah, actually, I don't think that's my scene.
smart man, Chuck. Smart man.
all right. All right. Take it easy. - You, too.
Hello, Mr. Martin. Your limousine is waiting outside.
you know my name.
have we made love before? - No.
daddy's got to go. Sorry. Later.
you did a great job, Chuck.
Thanks.
look, if-if there's something bothering you, then please tell me.
I know part of your job is to have all these secrets in your head, but you're not supposed to keep them from me.
I know. I know.
I saw you shoot that FULCRUM agent on Christmas Eve after they took over the Buy More.
and when I asked you about it... - I lied.
Yeah.
Chuck, I have to protect you.
I know that. I, I... I know that you do.
and you were protecting me. You were protecting all of us.
he had threatened my family, my friends, and you were just doing your job- I get that, but...
Sarah, the guy was unarmed and, and you just...
I did what I had to.
he knew who you really were. Your whole family was in danger.
and I'm sorry.
sometimes I forget that you never asked for all of this.
there's parts I'm not sure I'll ever get used to.
well, you deserve a break.
so, take tonight, tomorrow- whatever you need, it's yours.
and - hey
Hi, I'm Chuck.
here's a few things that you might need to know.
I'm not a Fulcrum agent.
I'm MI6 working undercover.
I want to apologize to you directly, Agent Barker.
we had no record you were MI6.
locked up in this dungeon's like keeping a Botticelli in the basement.
no one can appreciate the beauty.
I'm moving out.
and moving in with Morgan.
No!
I'm the Intersect. -No, he's not. It's me.
if you know who Chuck really is, then you pose a security threat.
if I proved anything to you by now, it's that I can keep my word.
Cole's been captured. You need to go into 24-hour protective detail.
what exactly does that mean?
we have to move in together.
he's a really tough guy. Maybe he won't talk.
Chuck, everyone talks.
what's your real name?
bond, James Bond.
how much does the CIA know about Perseus?
Oh, come on, not the face.
I'm only going to ask you one more question.
you answer it, and we're done.
who is the Intersect?
morning, Chuck.
how'd you sleep?
fine, thank you.
well, busy day.
lots to do.
uh, so, shower. Do you want to go first or...
I'm good.
you know, I know this whole 24-hour supervision thing isn't exactly great, but when the CIA finds us a new apartment, at least we'll have separate rooms.
sounds great.
I mean, consider yourself lucky.
at least you didn't have to move in with Casey, right?
Yeah.
lucky me.
mm, spearmint okay?
Yeah, fine.
traditionally, I'm a peppermint man, but I'm living on the edge.
Sarah, can I ask you a question?
about the toothpaste?
uh, no.
are you, you worried about Cole?
of, of course I'm concerned about Cole.
but Agent Barker can certainly take care of himself.
Yeah, I get that.
it's just, you know, you guys had this connection.
I mean, he saved your life and you shared a bit of torture.
uh, our connection was purely professional.
that's it.
Oh, okay.
Thanks, honey.
good morning!
sorry, sorry.
I'm just, I'm very excited for Chuck, for the both of you to be moving in together.
it's still happening, yeah?
Oh, yeah. -Absolutely.
great.
did you find a place yet?
not that I'm trying to rush you or anything.
take your time, bro. No pressure.
you two lovebirds need to find a nest where you can let the worm wiggle free.
thank you, Devon.
do you need any help packing or throwing things away?
Sarah, please tell Chuck that not everything in that room has to survive the move.
I'm making a list.
making, uh, making a list, are you?
and of what, may I ask?
Oh, well, where should we begin?
maybe the TRON Poster that you've had since you were 12.
dad gave me that poster,
I know. He loved that movie.
have you had any luck finding his address for the wedding?
no, not yet, but you know, I'm, I'm working on it still.
so, uh, how did Morgan take the news that he wasn't gonna get you as a new roommate?
I didn't tell him yet.
I don't have the heart.
morgan Grimes is so tired of listening to Big Mike punch his ma's time clock that he actually showed up for work on time today.
Oh, snap.
that's good. Laugh it up, fuzzballs.
that's right, sure.
but guess what.
I just landed the whale, 'cause me and my man Chuck, we're gonna be roommates.
so, yeah, yeah, have your fun. Have at it.
but don't expect any housewarming invitations from me.
don't give me that face.
Hey, Morgan, buddy, hey, we got to talk.
Yeah, you're just the man I wanted to see.
listen, I found a place. Dude, are you ready?
two bedrooms, one-and-a-quarter bath, half a fireplace.
about the apartment. -Yeah, dude, I know.
you and I, roommates. This is great.
we're living the dream, Chuck.
it's what we always talked about. -The thing is, the thing is, th-there is...
Bartkowski, my office now!
when did you get an office, John?
Hey, what's going on? We moving?
no-tell motel time for Chuck.
a secure bunker in an undisclosed location.
seriously, what's with the boxes?
Cole Barker was picked up 12 hours ago by FULCRUM.
we spent the entire night looking for him and failed.
they're gonna come here looking for you.
we're taking you off the grid.
wait, what about my sister?
is she in danger? Awesome, Morgan?
first priority is to get you safe.
then I'm gonna come back and make sure everybody else is okay.
if we get that far.
we have a perimeter breach.
this is it.
I'm gonna die underneath a yogurt shop.
back door now.
move, move, move.
Sarah, Sarah, we need to talk.
if I knew this was gonna happen...
later.
Chuck, get back!
take this.
did you miss me?
don't worry.
I didn't say a word.
look at that.
maybe you're not going away after all.
lucky you.
Yeah.
lucky me.
after that, it was eight, maybe nine guys until the door.
Oh, come one.
we're supposed to believe that he took out nine guys and escaped a FULCRUM holding facility all by himself.
please, I don't think we can trust this guy.
I've done nine before.
you've taken out nine guys?
just saying it's doable.
so when they questioned you about the Intersect...
I didn't tell them anything.
it's not my first dance, Walker.
if I talked, then Chuck, Casey, you...
why come back here after you escaped?
I wanted to make sure you were safe.
you are the sexiest man in the world.
for you.
it's our 16-month anniversary.
wait a minute. We had a "no gift" policy.
I didn't get you anything.
Morgan, you're the worst person at keeping secrets.
I already know what you got me.
you left the lease for our new apartment in the fax machine.
a life together is the best present ever!
and when we move in,
I'm gonna show you your mother isn't the only one who can be noisy in the bedroom.
I gotta go call my parents.
I thought you were moving in with Chuck?
I am.
we are.
Anna misunderstood. She found the lease.
now she thinks... -Oh, my God.
Oh, buddy, you are screwed.
no, actually, I think if I tell the truth at this point, it'll end the sexual component of our relationship.
and I'll be there to pick up the pieces.
what? -Shh-shh-shh, relax, Morgan.
all you have to do is convince Anna that moving in with you is a bad idea.
okay, but how am I gonna... -Sh-sh-shh, bubeleh, you've come to the right place.
repulsion is our business.
and business is good.
thanks to information provided by Mr. Barker, we now know that FULCRUM is protecting a man that goes by the code name "Perseus.
Perseus is the head scientist behind FULCRUM's effort to build their own Intersect.
anything, Chuck?
I spent the past year undercover trying to get close to him, but only the inner circle is ever allowed contact with the man.
intel tells us Perseus is attending a formal event tonight at the Swiss Consul's office.
the State Department has arranged invitations for the two of you.
um, the two, the two of who?
agent Walker and Agent Casey.
are you sure, General?
I'd be happy to accompany Agent Walker.
I bet you would.
I'd be happy to go, too.
Oh, aren't you popular?
I mean, you know, I am, I am the Intersect and everything.
neither Agent Barker nor Bartkowski will be going on this mission.
fulcrum is still actively searching for the two of you.
both of you will stay in CASTLE and monitor by remote feed.
if you recognize anyone, you'll have radio.
well, at least no one's telling us to...
you heard the General.
you stay in the bunker. -And there it is.
phase one of operation repulsion: the obscure and disturbing hobby.
take that, you chauvinist pig.
told you not mess with Billie Jean.
you bitch.
Hey, Morgan, I'm done for the day.
you want to take me over, show me the new apartment?
uh, you know what, I'd love to, hon, but we're in the middle of recreating some of the best tennis matches ever played, and I'm up next.
mcenroe, Stockholm,'84.
you can't be serious.
Yes!
look on the bright side.
when we move in together, you can play, too.
it will be like a nonstop Wimbledon final in our living room.
doubles anyone?
don't touch me with that.
video check. Do we have a signal?
Yep, we got you.
and you look fantastic.
Sarah, is that dress CIA issue, or do you just make everything look that good?
let's stay focused here, people, huh?
we are on a mission.
you do look gorgeous, Sarah.
this is Chuck speaking by the way.
Chuck, you get in Casey's ear, I'll get in Sarah's.
okay, you two, split up.
Sarah, you've got an unsecured exit at 2: 00.
the guy in the bad suit standing in front of the Swiss flag is packing.
Casey, you got a bogey.
a tray of crab cakes coming in on your 10: 00.
I'm just trying to be helpful, okay?
works up an appetite on missions.
grab that little
Sarah, the Italian minister for trade is headed your way.
now he can get a little handsy.
hello.
I'm Paolo Giordano.
I saw you arrive and couldn't help but admire your beauty.
his wife's name is Isabella and he has three little bambinos.
thank you.
how are Isabella and the children?
nicely done.
not so bad yourself.
Thanks.
thank you. Just, uh, just doing our job.
me and Cole, Cole and me.
take your victory lap later, Bartowski.
who else haven't we seen?
I don't know, look at the people by that ice goose thing.
Oh, okay, I just flashed.
the shorter balding gentleman in the sweater wearing the glasses that has got to be Perseus.
I have a visual. Moving in.
his name is Howard Busgang.
he's a research scientist with the Department of Defense.
good job, Chuck.
I have a few skills of my own now, don't I?
so nine guys, huh? Really, you're not fudging that number?
not even a little bit?
sounds harder than it is.
always go for the knee.
you mean like sweep the leg?
Ooh, I'm sorry.
excuse me.
that's him. -Well, yeah.
you're a little late to the party. I just flashed.
no, not Busgang, him.
he was the guy who was torturing me.
he's Fulcrum.
you two have a nice evening.
Where'd they go?
Where'd they go? -Where'd they go?
my guess is that Fulcrum made them, and they just jammed the signal.
Oh, uh, Dr. Busgang.
I don't believe we've meet before.
how do you do?
your friends are in trouble. -I've gathered that.
we have to call General Beckman.
for what?
so she can tell us what to do next.
I'll tell you what we do next.
we go to the consulate and we save them.
no, no, no, no.
Sarah and Casey specifically said for us to stay here.
Yeah, well, sometimes things don't always go according to plan, Chuck.
you have to improvise.
look, you can't just go run off and be the hero all the time.
it's not about wanting to be a hero, Chuck.
two guns, huh? Oh, you really are a badass.
no, Chuck, one gun.
the other one... is for you.
let's go.
so we're going to need a cover.
normally we stay in the service arena-- waiter, busboy, may be valet.
how about we mix it up this time?
what do you think about dentists?
dentists at a consulate party?
you got a better idea?
I say we go as spies.
it's a little obvious, but I guess we can do it your way.
but the data acquisition problem in Minsky's "society-of-mind" theory was addressed in large part by Singh's "E-M-One" paper back in...
2005 -Sounds fascinating.
Yes.
more champagne? -Please.
radio's still out. Let's grab this guy and get out of here.
now, where was I?
you were telling me about all the wonderful work you do for the government.
that sounds fascinating.
I'd like to hear about that, too.
you going to knock him out, too?
there are civilians everywhere.
we have to find another way in.
we should have called Beckman, had her send a team.
and miss out on all this fun?
come on, get in the game, Chuck, before Fulcrum takes out your team.
I think they already have.
Oh, you-you can't be serious.
there's got to be a ground floor option.
this is good. We're going up here.
damn.
damn it.
Cole, Cole, you're bleeding. -No, I'm fine.
no, you're not. No, you're not.
Get...get... -What are you doing, Chuck?
what do you mean what am I doing? I'm doing this.
Duncan, what's with the guns?
who are these people?
not your concern, Howard.
we work for the government, Dr. Busgang.
so do I. Tell them, Duncan. We work for the CIA.
the men you work for are terrorists.
we're not terrorists.
we're patriots, Howard.
you're a patriot.
it's a group of spies that turned your back on the country.
you couldn't have it more wrong.
who do you think we are?
we do what needs to be done to preserve this nation's rightful place in the world.
someday, you'll thank us.
well, not you-- you'll be dead.
I swear I'm just a scientist.
they said I was helping the country.
unfortunately, Howard, that was the wrong thing to say.
Hey, Cole, Cole, hey!
I found them, I found them.
the guy who tortured you is inside with a couple of other big goons with guns.
okay, give me 20 seconds, then you go in there, start taking guys out, okay?
no, wait, wait, wait!
listen, about the whole-- about the whole gun thing
Casey and Sarah, they've never really let me-- I don't -- how do I say this?-- I've never fired one.
Chuck, it's point and click.
you point at the bad guys, pull the trigger.
Yes, I get the whole concept.
still... 20 seconds.
wait...
we're dead. Bartowski's got a gun.
it's a shame, Howard.
you really do have an incredible mind.
Freeze!
federal Agent!
I'm hit!
man down! Man down!
I'll take care of Chuck. Get the doctor!
sorry about that.
I'm really not normally this aggressive with women.
Oh, my God.
you've been shot.
I'm fine.
Hey, guys, I think, uh...
I think I might need medical attention. My ankle is seriously...
Cole took a bullet to save Sarah.
you okay, buddy? What happened?
nothing.
nothing. I'm f...I'm fine.
really. Never mind.
what's that, mahogany?
you don't look so good.
can't say the same for you.
be gentle now.
I bruise easy.
well, then maybe you should consider taking better care of yourself.
this might hurt a bit.
you know, I've been poked at by more spook doctors than I care to remember.
it's nice to be looked after by someone who treats you as more than just a name, rank and serial number.
I know what you mean.
okay, now, just relax.
hold that.
Thanks, doc.
well, thank you for saving my life.
what was I gonna do, not see you again?
Hey. Howdy.
how you doing in here?
right. Absolutely.
Yeah, sorry about that. I was just come...
coming by to see if you guys need anything.
Cole? Soup? A bisque of some kind? Or an US Weekly? I don't read it myself, -but I hear that when you're sick or injured... -Walker! Barker!
briefing in five.
also that briefing in five.
that was kind of a business thing.
I'll see you in five.
it's like four-and-a-half now.
what are you reading there, sweetie?
did you know IKEA sells 17 kinds of home shelving?
I can only pronounce two of them, though.
isn't it silly?
listen. You know what?
I wanted to apologize about last night and the whole Wimbledon thing.
I guess I was just trying to set some boundaries before we move in, and I realize there is a more mature way to handle this. You know?
so, uh, well, there you go.
a Morgan-Nuptial? -Right.
I had Lester's cousin draw it up for us.
a little something to ensure that there are no cohabitating conflicts.
no pets? What about Chico?
Oh, that's right. Chico.
I guess you have to put him down now, huh?
the only cheese allowed in the house is string.
or gouda.
on weekends.
are you insane?
just a teensy-weensy bit particular.
and listen to me.
I would totally understand if you're having second thoughts.
are you kidding me?
Morgan, you're hilarious.
I'll sign whatever you want.
maybe it makes me nuts, too, but I love you, ridiculous quirks and all.
I should have that framed.
totally.
damn it. I should have gone with provolone.
Mr. Barker, I understand you were hurt protecting Agent Walker.
I am told you showed great courage.
just doing my job, General.
actually, it was Chuck who showed great courage on this mission.
he was also injured in the line of duty.
he got clipped by a window sill.
it's as pathetic as it sounds.
is there any new intel on Busgang or his FULCRUM handler, General?
we now know that the man Chuck identified last night, Dr. Howard Busgang, is in fact codenamed Perseus.
he is a former DARPA scientist who worked on the original Intersect.
uh, why was that information not in my flash?
as a safety precaution, anything about the creators of the Intersect was redacted from our files.
I'm sorry. Did you just say this guy created the Intersect?
he was part of the team that developed its underlying architecture.
he knows as much about how it works as anyone.
that means he might know how to get it out of my head.
we don't know, Chuck.
but it's possible?
perhaps.
we got to find him.
we got to find this guy before FULCRUM does.
we are putting every available resource on it, Chuck.
agents Walker and Casey, prepare for a video link.
you're going to brief our field agents, bring them up to speed.
good luck.
Roger that.
Oh, let me...
Hey, what are you looking at there?
Oh, just, you know, footage from the consulate.
maybe there's something I missed.
you did great tonight, Chuck.
Thanks.
you were your usual superhuman self.
you saved Sarah's life.
no.
it was a team effort.
I get what she sees in you, you know.
the fearlessness in the face of danger, the imperviousness to pain.
super-cool tank tops.
stop me whenever this is getting uncomfortable.
no.
the briefing is about to start. -Great.
I'll be right there.
on my way.
Oh, you meant him.
of course you meant him. What?
right.
my God, could she really be...
Un-repulseable?
I'm beginning to think so.
no, sir.
not on my watch.
what are you suggesting?
you're going to need a quart of peanut oil, some bubble-wrap, and as much yarn as you can find.
Hey, guys.
Hey, Morgan, we need to talk.
Yeah. Hey, what's going on?
and what's with the limp?
nothing. No, I twisted my ankle.
Yeah. Jogging.
which I do, occasionally. I'm fine.
we need to talk about...
about the Anna situation? Not a problem, Charles. We are on it.
you are looking at three individuals gifted in the art of repulsion.
Anna doesn't stand a chance.
why are you trying to repulse Anna? -No, no, no.
Lester, that's ridiculous.
what I was trying to do was simply test her. -That's all.
testing her, why?
because, Chuck, because she's trying to get all serious with me, and I want to make sure that she loves me for me and not...
other things.
excuse us.
are you crazy?
what other things could she possibly be loving you for?
I mean, honestly, buddy.
you know that I love you, but-but you're lucky to have a girl in your life who loves you for you, even though you are, in fact...you.
fair.
I you don't stop testing her, she's going to choose to be with someone else.
and then you will have realized, and unfortunately, too late, that you lost the catch of a lifetime.
Counterpoint: she's not the catch of a lifetime.
she's a scheming tart who will harvest your organs and sell them to the highest bidder.
Chuck's right.
Lester wrong.
what happened?-Nothing.
it's a flesh wound. It's nothing. I'm fine.
well, let's see. Sit down.
up, up.
sorry, sorry. Devon, can you help?
what's up, babe?
we need to get Chuck to the hospital.
we got to X-ray this leg.
no, we don't. I'm fine.
pretty swollen there.
I'm actually a lot tougher than people think I am.
I know you are, buddy.
sometimes it takes a real man to admit when you're hurt.
Ouch.
that actually hurt.
I didn't think anything hurt you.
Oh, no, there are some things.
the clinical disinterest of a beautiful woman, for instance.
any word on Busgang?-Not yet.
Casey and I are headed to the airport.
they think Busgang might try to leave the country.
all right, then.
rest up.
wait. Listen.
you know, I meant what I said earlier about being around people who really care about you and who you really care about.
it doesn't happen often for people like us.
no. It doesn't.
what if we're lucky enough to find that person?
we're supposed to just walk away?
doesn't seem fair, does it?
no.
because it isn't.
is the cast absolutely necessary?-Yes.
it could be a hairline fracture.
better safe than sorry.
I'm going to go find you some crutches.
no, absolutely not.
I want to be released immediately.
I'm sorry, sir. This is a gunshot wound.
we have to report this.
this is outrageous.
I don't care about your rules.
I don't care about what you have to do.
I'm leaving now.
sir, I highly suggest you stay overnight in case your leg gets infected.
I can't do that.
I have to go.
Casey, it's Chuck. Look, I found Busgang.
he's here at the hospital. Westside Medical.
you found him. Great work. All right.
we'll have a strike team there in a half an hour.
no, no, no. He's leaving.
don't follow him, Chuck. It's too dangerous.
he might know how to get the Intersect out of my head.
I can't let him go.
listen to me.
do not go after him on your own.
do not be a hero here, Chuck.
look, I don't want to be a hero, but sometimes, you need to be.
besides, this is doable.
I've got them both.
I'm looking for Mr. Busgang.
do you have an appointment?
no. Yeah, well.
the thing is, see, I'm a computer tech.
um, Nerd Herd.
that's me.
and apparently, Mr. Busgang has some major hardware problems.
constellation Science, second floor. -Thank you.
can I help you gentlemen?
turn around.
slowly.
you're the guy who shot me. -It was an accident, I swear.
it was the first time I had ever handled a gun and the first time that I had shot someone.
clearly those two things must be connected in some way.
Hi. I'm Chuck.
sit down and don't move.
I need to accidentally shoot you.
I didn't come to hurt you or even take you in.
I just want some answers about the Intersect.
what do you know about the Intersect?
a lot, actually.
who are you?
did you just flash?
cover the stairs.
you're the one they've been talking about, aren't you?
I didn't believe it could be true.
a human Intersect.
extraordinary.
maybe for you.
but you have to understand, for me...
for me, it's a nightmare.
living with this thing in my head is ruining my life.
is there any way th-that Intersect images can be taken out?
you know, can a person be "de-Intersected"?
can it be removed?
possibly.
I don't know.
only Orion would know.
Orion? Who is Orion?
it was his idea, his vision.
everything is based on his work.
he put the team together, he drove the research, -until he realized -Put the gun down,
Howard. Who's Orion? Where can I find him?
please! I need to know!
split up!
I haven't told him anything.
No! No!
that's the second time you've shot me.
let's hope the third time's the charm.
sweep the leg.
Hey, are you okay? -I'm fine. The gun.
what? -Chuck, the gun!
Oh, help!
are you okay?
Yeah, I think so!
I think so.
Oh, you were, you were talking to him.
I thought you were asking if I was okay but you're talking to him because he's been shot again, right.
my bad.-No, I was talking to both of you.
we're okay, right? We're okay.
Yeah...right.
absolutely, we're okay.
excellent work, team.
while we would have preferred to take Busgang alive, by capturing his work we've significantly set back Fulcrum's ability to build their own Intersect.
uh, what about that name? Orion?
Busgang said that Orion could maybe get the Intersect out of my head.
as of now, we have no leads, but our best people are on it.
agent Barker, medical transport for you back to the U. K. has been arranged.
thank you, General.
so, it seems my work here is done...
again.
agent Casey, it's been a real pleasure working with you.
Yeah, likewise.
can I ask you something?
when you escaped from Fulcrum, you really take out nine guys?
the truth?
professional courtesy.
it was more like 12.
I just don't like to boast.
Hey, so, what's next?
wing back to London and jam with The Stones?
I have to say, Chuck, you are truly the most special agent I've ever worked with.
special.
good luck with getting that thing out of your head.
Thanks, but, uh, I'm beginning to think that's never going to happen.
you know what?
I got a not-so-secret secret for you.
you want something bad enough, don't ever take no for an answer.
and...
for God sakes, man, carry a gun. Maybe two.
nice cast.
Ellie go to work on you?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm just happy it's not full body.
Morgan, we gotta talk about the whole moving-in thing.
I know we do. Chuck,
I just don't know how to say this.
I...
you should have a seat.
okay.
sometimes things happen between, uh, two people who care about each other very much.
um, and it doesn't mean that they don't belong together.
belong together? What are you talking about?
uh, no, no, no.
I can't move in with you, Chuck, because I'm going to move in with Anna.
she loves me and she wants to move in with me.
and I want to make her happy.
but I want you to understand.
I do, buddy.
seriously, I totally understand and furthermore,
I think that you are absolutely making the right decision.
that's awesome. Thank you.
she gonna be okay with your string cheese habit?
I know she will be, bro.
Hey, and, uh, you and I, you know, we'll still be...
friends?
as opposed to what?
that's an excellent point.
Dr. Walker, my superiors agree that I need 24-hour round- the-clock medical assistance.
our jet awaits.
I'm sorry, I have yogurt to serve.
you'll have to find somebody else to take care of you.
now, now, you see, that's not going to work because no one else is gonna make me feel like you do.
believe me, I've looked.
I'm serious.
don't pack your bags, don't say good-byes, just close your eyes and say yes.
come with me, Sarah.
I'm sorry.
what's the matter?
I thought you were a girl who liked adventure.
I guess I'm not the kind of girl who cheats on her cover boyfriend.
is that all he is? A cover?
what do you mean?
I saw the way you looked at him when his life was in danger.
I've been doing this a long time, Agent Walker.
well, who'd have thought it.
Cole Barker loses the girl to Chuck Bartowski.
when you meet somebody you care about, it's just hard to walk away.
I couldn't have said it better myself.
how's your foot?
uh, throbbing.
Thanks.
did Cole leave?
he's quite a guy.
uh, yeah.
that he is.
you know, I understand what you see in him.
he's a great spy.
top of good guys.
the truth is, you two would make a great team.
Chuck... -Please, let me just finish.
Sarah, I'm not gonna move in with you.
because I can't.
and you know why I can't.
I'm crazy about you, and I've always been.
but you know, having a fake relationship, that's one thing.
but living together is...
I mean, every day being around each other and-and...
and that's why I can't do it.
and I hope you understand.
I do.
thank you.
Oh, and, uh, just so you know,
I am going to get this thing out of my head one day.
I will.
and when I do, I'm going to live the life that I want with the girl that I love.
because I'm not going to let this thing rob me of that.
Hey, how's the ankle?
I picked up some boxes in case you wanted to start packing up your room.
change of plans, not moving out, talk later.
the old heated doorknob. Nice try.
Lester, you still giving me the silent treatment?
okay.
everybody, good morning. -Good morning.
your coffee, sir.
Ah, jeffrey, thank you so much.
you know, call me old-fashioned, but...
I just... I prefer cream over laxative.
I need everybody's attention.
I know some of you are unhappy that I'm running the buy more.
I'm sorry.
but all your little tricks and your tactics...
I know them all. I taught you them.
so listeup. No more sabotage.
thank you. Lester, you're in my chair.
if there's one thing I learned in hawaii, is that I'm good at this, men.
I am good at the buy more.
do me a favor and grab chuck for me?
could somebody grab chuck for me?
Hey, jeff, can you send chuck back here for me?
Casey, I want to ask you about a beastmaster.
Really?
no, not really.
Hey, have we got any more info on you-know-who down in castle?
Shaw? -Yeah, yeah, shaw.
I'm busy here, chuck. Why don't you talk to him yourself? He's living there.
living in castle. What? What?!
Casey, what's goinon? Is he really in charge of our team?
Shaw's a special agent for the cia.
he can do pretty much whatever he wants.
even more special than me?
it gets worse.
whenever a special agent takes over an operation, they conduct a review.
Sarah's in there with him right now.
what do you think they're talking about?
is chuck bartkowski a real spy?
Yes, of course he is. I mean, his training has been irregular and he was a civilian only two years ago.
well, these mission reports tell a different story.
sometimes he sounds like bond, and other times it's like a jerry lewis movie.
I need to know, is chuck a liability?
wait. The review's about me?! shouldn't shaw be asking me about me?
Where's the fun in that?
look, I am never gonna be able to escape this ridiculous cover if shaw thinks i'm some moron civilian who just got unlucky enough to get a computer dumped in his head.
fine.
help.
Morgan, did you get glued to a chair?
Yes. Yes, I did, okay? The whole store's coming after me, dude.
Lester went mu and refuses to talk to me.
maybe 'cause you fired him?
I don't know. They've teamed up and formed, like, an evil cabal of tricksters.
I haven't had an untainted cup of coffee in days. I need my free coffee, dude.
you know, you give me five minutes running this popsicle stand, and we'd be ready.
ready for what?
the russians.
Hey. Hey-hey-hey-hey. -Guys, a little help.
is that-is that shaw?
listen, I'm an integral member of this team, okay?
my voice should be heard.
Oh, your prepubescent little girl screams are gonna be duly noted.
actually, right now. He wants to see you.
look, shaw, I'm quite certain that things have been said about either myself or my abilities as a spy, and while I concede that there are more traditional or professional spies out there...
Chuck, this is my meeting.
right. Sorry. Please continue.
I think we can all agree that this team has been dysfunctional the last two years.
and I think I know what the problem is.
Thproblem is them.
what? What does that mean?
it means he's a moron.
Chuck, they coddle you.
you could be a great spy, but they won't let you evolve.
Really?
I mean, yes, yes, really. He's right.
let me be a spy. Let me out of the car. I'm ready.
no, shaw, he's not.
duly noted... And ignored.
undercover in paris. Are you ready?
Absolutely.
um, so what are we r doing here exactly? lanced since your intersect skills can be glitchy, you'll need some basic spycraftfor this mission.
have you ever used one of these?
a pen?
Kgb-model tranq pen.
Oh, yeah, casey's got one of these.
aim it at your target's food or drink, and it's bedtime for bad guy.
you want me tranq jeff? I can't do that.
I'veead everyone's file. Jeff barnes will be just fine.
come on, chuck, are you up for this?
Hey, jeffy-jeff. How's it hanging, brother?
everything okay? -Yeah.
what do you mean, "okay"? What are you doing?
you don't usually check up on me like this.
did I do something wrong?
no, no, no, no, buddy. Everything's fine.
you're fine, work's fine, you know.
this is more of a checking in.
just making sure that you're feeling okay.
just a little human-To-humanoid interaction, so...
good.
Thanks, yeah. Little bit of a rocky start, but I think I finished strong. What's next?
let's go. You're ready.
Wh... Whoa. I am? I'm ready after 20 seconds?
after two years. I just wanted to talk to you privately, chuck.
listen, you've been on more missions than most spies ve been in a lifetime.
ust me, you're ready.
freshly brewed, untouched by jeff's lips.
checkmate, lester. Checkmate.
as assistant manager, I claim this cup of coffee for me.
okay, that's what I'm talking...
you guys got to understand something. You got to get up pretty early to get...
a cia contact will meet you in paris.
you're traveling as carmichael, a successful businessman.
itinerary and passport.
guys, it's all good. I'm ready, okay?
what are these?
nunchakus.
you know very well that I don't like carrying guns around.
but I thought it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have some kind of offensive weapon, you know, just to have with me just in case.
and they're supposed to be in the intersect, so...
Casey, can I have a second?
Yeah.
listen, I know you want this to work and you want to impress shaw, but this is crazy.
okay, fine, the nunchakus are a little crazy.
you weren't supposed to see those.
but shaw... An honest-to-god, real-life special agent for the cia...
thinks that I'm ready.
he thinks that I can do it, and I want to prove to him that he's not wrong about me.
I'm not saying that you can't do this, but please...Please just don't go now.
okay? You need more time.
he's going. Beckman agrees with me.
we set up a subnwork on your phone.
you'll be ableo text and call from the plane.
your ticket, and your car's waiting outside.
you'll receive further instructions in paris.
Oh, daddy! First class! That is...
probably what you do for everybody.
okay, well, see ya later.
I hope.
thank you.
welcome to fst class, sir. May I take your jacket?
you want to take my jack...Oh, yes, of course. Yes, sorry about that.
Oh, actually, you know what? If I can just... Gotta get my phone and writing utensil. Okay.
lucky pen? huh?
lucky pen?
no, uh, no, just a... Just a regular ol' pen-pen.
okay.
I'm chuck, by the way. I mean, charles.
I mean, my name is charles, but my friends call me chuck.
I'm hannah. Just hannah, chuck.
good, that makes it easy.
nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you.
may I offer either of you a drink?
Ooh, uh, no. You know what? I'm on business, but thank you.
me, too. I'll have his.
you know, on second thought, I think I will then.
thank you. For you. Uh-huh.
thank you. Sure.
so what do you think of our fellow passengershere in first class?
I'm thinking syrian dignitaries over there, couple of nuclear physicists, but that bunch, I don't know about them.
that bunch over there?
Yeah, I'm gonna go with yale fencing team without a doubt.
spot-on.
now what about you, charles- But-my-friends-call-me-chuck?
what about-what about me?
, I'm in retail, very high-end merchandise at a very prestigious store.
what the...?
come on! Get me out of here! This is not...
Hey, casey.
Oh, thank you.
see that? See that? How do you do that?
you command respect. I...
no. I take it.
shaken, not stirred, sir.
thank you.
you don't fly first class often?
well, No, no, of course I do. All the time.
l. a. To paris. Paris to l. a.
what about you?
well, i, uh, I work for a private investor.
essentially, he just flies me around the world, and I fix problems for him, it stuff.
computers, mainframes. It's terribly boring. And stress, a lot of stress.
but I get to travel.
and live in paris. I have a view of the eiffel tower.
no way. Really?
Yeah. Have you been?
to the eiffel tower? Yeah. So many times. Can't even count how many
I know everything there is to know about it.
Mr. Muscles?
let me take a gander.
I'm thinking professional wrestler, maybe.
I don't know. Tough to tell. Kind of nondescript, really.
don't you think? Would you excuse me for just a second?
I got to use the little boys' room.
I'll be right back.
okay. Okay.
Hey, guys, you there?
Chuck, have you flashed yet?
Yeah. How did you know I'd flash?
because your mission's not in paris, chuck.
your mission is on the plane.
what do you mean, my mission is on the plane?
what do you mean, the mission is on the plane?
hugo panzer, the man you flashed on. He's a ring agent.
he's moving a cia crypto key to paris.
he'll have put it in cargo. You'll need to g his claim ticket, go to the cargo hold, find his bag, get the key.
Yeah, I'm only seeing problems with that plan right now.
hugo panzer is a bit, findon the large side. Key.
Chuck, I gave you the pen for a reason. You can do this.
the pen. Of course. The pen. Tranq him, get the ticket.
no problem.
Chuck, please be careful. Hugo panzer is very dangerous.
he is a master at close-quarters combat.
Sarah, don't you worry.
I will have that key back bere they serve the lobster.
and by the way, I'm que looking forward to that. Hello?
you should have told me.
and this is why I didn't.
Chuck is not ready for paris and he's certainly not ready for a midair mission.
I mean, we can't even go in and help him.
well, now we find out if your asset is a real spy.
who are you, agent shaw?
because, you know, I have never heard of you, and neither has casey.
you're a very well kept secret.
I do like my secrets. Don't you?
being the daughter of a con man teaches you that.
you really do read everybody's files.
of course. And I have a few questions for you.
seven months ago, when chuck was in prague, you went off grid for three days.
this is a surveillance photo of a hotel in lisbon.
this is you.
Beckman ordered you to stay in contact, but you ran. Why?
it's not what you think.
I don't know what to think. Are you a double agent?
a ring operative? Or is this about chuck?
excuse me, sir? Sorry to bother you.
the woman that I'm sitting next to is a bit of a nuisance.
will not shut up.
so I was kind of wondering if I could plop down here, if that's okay.
fine. -Thanks. Awesome.
Yeah, you know, I think she's an upgrade. It's such a bummer, too, because one of the things I love about first class is the opportunity to really socialize and rub elbows with people that are, you know, like-minded, and not the rabble. Don't you agree?
excuse me.
Oh, yeah, sure. Do your thing.
crossword time!
one across, "ecru.
it's the air pressure. -What? Huh?
pens don't always work on planes because of the pressure change.
that-that's fascinating. - Let me try.
Oh, no, please don't...
sorry. Sorry about that. Sorry.
that wasn't ink.
sir, this is first class.
who are you? - Nobody.
who are you?
KGB.
any updates on chuck?
relax, casey. He's doing fine.
Hey, john. Uh, do you have a second? I need a favor.
not interested.
Oh, I hate to pull rank here, uh, john, but I am your superior.
what?
I need you. Okay, please help me.
I don't know what they'll do next...Mute lester and his gang.
Ey've taken over the store. They set booby traps for me everywhere.
I'm going crazy here. I can't fight them by myself anymore.
they don't follow any rules.
insurgents?
I hate insurgents.
then this will work out, I think.
Hey. Hey, guys. I'm in the cargo hold, and it's friggin' freezing in here.
good job. Look for the matching ticket, find the key, get back to your seat.
come on.
I'm right, aren't i? I should tell you, i'm always right.
it's annoying, but true.
why don't you tell me what you're right about so I can tell you thatou're wrong?
my theory about you and chuck.
most spies push their assets to perform. That's what I do.
you protect him. You care for him. You followed him to lisbon.
that's not true. -Come on.
I was right about this mission, and I'm right about you.
you know, chuck isn't home free yet.
what do you got, chuck? -I found it. It's a casket.
smart. The ring knows that customs won't check the body.
open it up. Find the key.
that's kind of disgusting.
get it done, chuck.
Hi. Sorry about this.
where are you? Ooh! Oh, dead hands. Dead, cold hands. Dead, cold... Oh.
here we go.
Ooh, that's disgusting. Gah! Dead skin, dead skin, dead skin.
jackpot.
it's chuck.
don't answer. He's taken care of hugo. All he has to do is find the key.
he shouldn't need to call.
Sarah, pick up. Pick up your phone.
and what if he's in trouble?
go ahead, answer it.
just know that if you do, he'll never be a real sp and one day, that will get him killed.
sorry. Sorry, old man. Sorry, old man.
don't freak out.
listen, I'm in a little bit of a pickle right now.
I am currently trapped in a coffin with a recently deceased elderly man and a very large bad guy trying to find me.
aren't you still on the plane?
right, yes, I forgot to mention that part. The mission is on the plane.
I have the key, but the ring operative is right outside.
what do I do? You get taken.
What?!
the ring agent's gonna find you, because you picked the single dumbest place to hide.
Oh, gee, thanks. Criticism is always welcome.
when he does, you act like your little girlish self.
you scream like a banshee, so he doesn't think you're a threat.
when he pulls you out, you find a weapon and then flash.
well, what if I don't flash?
then you're dead... So flash.
Yeah, casey?
Walker, bartowski's in trouble. The ring operative has him.
what? Chuck's been taken.
I'm opening a line to his phone.
I sincerely hope that that's not your father.
you should've taken my watch.
my employer demands a certain heart ratewhen I'm on the job.
got a little present for you.
they really are a fencing team.
why don't you just come here? I'll do this clean.
easy. No pain.
please be in the intersect.
en garde.
point. -What's the matter with you? You know you're gonna die.
you missed. A lot.
Chuck, chuck, what's happening?
Hey, guys, i'm still alive, and my first solo mission was a success.
buckle up, buy more-ians, it's gonna be a bumpy ride.
meet my new lieutenant assistant manager, john casey.
you guys know john from appliances. Or maybe you remember him from the volleyball incident at last year's employee picnic.
either way, for those of you who are willing to abandon the plot to sabotage me in my assistant managership, you're free to go.
well, well, well, lookie what we have here.
this is a no-smoking store.
Thanks, jeff.
do you know what, my lieutenant has the right to smoke a cigar if he wants.
or he can put it out.
Mr. Casey.
anyone else want to leave?
anything you got to say, big guy?
Lester says this... Isn't over.
does he?
and I know it sounds outrageous, but the eiffel tower's most amazing engineering feat is the elevator itself...
and with that, I realize i'm the most boring person in the world.
no, no, that was an amazing story. And-and I really like your model.
Thanks.
it was a...Gift from my dad.
can I ask you a personal question?
sure.
have you ever been to paris, chuck?
of course. That's a...
no, I haven't. -It's just that you talked about it with such wonder, like someone who's always wanted to go.
no one in first class ever wants to do anything that badly.
you're different; you stand out.
thank you. This is all kind of new to me.
I think I just wanted to fit in, you know?
Why? What's your secret, chuck?
uh, the truth is, I work at the buy more in burbank.
you know, the...In the nerd herd department.
I did a home theater install at this guy's house in l. a. and, uh, he liked it so much that he wanted me to do the same thing in his home in paris.
so here I am. His ticket... I'm just along for the ride.
I don't really belong in paris, or... First class, for that matter.
that's not true. Do you want to know my secret?
is it scary?
no. I just got fired from my job.
I thought I'd actually convinced them to let me stay, but...
I am now officially flying to pari to empty out my office.
I'm so sorry.
it's okay.
meeting you almost makes it worth it.
you're not here, you're still sleeping.
you're still in bed.
just relax. Just watch the red dot.
this is your boss. Morgan is your boss.
morgan is your boss. Morgan is your boss.
Casey morgan is lester's boss.
that's right. You're happy that morgan is your boss.
wait. this morgan person is real?
this store you work in, it actually exists?
Yeah, oh, yeah. Yes to both of those things.
although, even personally, I have quite often wondered if the buy more was really an insane asylum, but yeah.
what is it?
that-that, uh, that drink, I don't remember... Ordering it.
it just kind of appeared out of nowhere.
a- and you drank it. Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, i'm fine, I'm fine.
just tasted a little... A little funny.
Yeah, you look like you've been poisoned.
that's crazy.
Chuck? Is something wrong?
I've just been poisoned! Someone just poisoned me!
I think it was hugo... I tied him up downstairs in the cargo hold, but somehow he escaped!
what did it taste like?
it was very complex. It had a strong nose, with hints of apple, and then a very sour finish.
he's right, it's poison.
Chuck, you have to throw up.
that's disgusting.
just do it right now.
busy! It's hugo... He is coming for me.
sir, are you okay? Do you need any help?
sorry, mexican food. You do not want to come in here.
scream, and you're dead.
I am so writing a letter to the airline about this.
shut up. There's only one antidote for that poison, and I have it. Now, right now, you're feeling queasy.
in an hour, you'll be in more pain than you could possibly imagine.
okay, fine. What do you want?
the key! Now!
what key?
Ooh! Oh, th-the key.
you have it; I want it. Give it to me.
and don't lie. I'll kill you right here.
I have the key, but I don't have it on me...
I hid it down in the cargo hold.
Hi.
isn't poisoning me enough?
now, Where's the key?
antidote first.
is this your first mission?
maybe.
you led my agent to a mission with two ring operatives?
he's going to make it. -how?
watch. This is blackbriar to crystal palace.
do you have me, palace? -Copy that.
I need to initiate an executive office override.
put sentry satellite into inverse orbit over millennium atlantic flight 3923.
standing by for 3923...
what are you doing?
four years ago, we launched a satellite designed to take control of enemy fighters.
surprisingly, the thing actually works. You're a pilot, right?
you're gonna take control of that plane? That's a 747.
I hope you're a quick learner... Captain walker.
call chuck.
all right, I work for the cia, okay? And that's my boss.
I cannot give up the key without his authorization first.
answer it. On speaker.
Hi, guys. If you're wondering, i'm doing just dandy.
aside from being captured, poisoned and repeatedly socked in the gut!
I have your agent. Order him to give me the key.
who is this?
I work for a third party, and my employer doesn't tolerate failure.
now, your man...
Oh, chuck. Seat 2b.
...chuck here will be dead in an hour.
but I'm in a rush, so he gives me the key or I kill him now.
okay.
o- okay?
did he just say... Did you just say...?
I think you meant to say,"please don't kill my good friend chuck.
before you shoot him, one thing: what type of poison are you using?
I'm not bluffing. This is a cyanide hybrid.
cyanide hybrid!
you've used it before in berlin.
what?
Serena, you used that same poison to take out the syrian ambassador, and I know you work for the ring.
how do you know this?
don't worry about that.
do what I say. Give my agent the antidote, and I'll let you and your guerillas slide on this one.
who are you?
Serena, you can do this. Let him go.
I can't. You know my employer.
your agent is alone and he's going to die.
no, my people are never alone. now.
disengaging yaw damper.
inducing negative gs.
we've run into a patch of turbulence. Please return to your seats right now.
you shot a gun on a plane?! Are you crazy?!
Sarah, level offthe plane now! -Got it.
Hey, I'm alive and I have the key.
unfortunately, I did not get to use my nunchakus.
this is Blackbriar to Crystal Palace.
disable link on my mark. -Copy that.
three, two, one. Break. -Uplink terminated.
thank you, Palace.
well, the flight crew will never even know we were there.
just another day in the office.
I do everything I can to protect my people.
I lost one spy. It was my fault.
and it will never happen again.
why were you in Lisbon?
I went to bury Bryce, my partner.
he wanted his ashes there.
lisbon was our first mission.
I knew I wasn't supposed to leave, but I promised him that I would take care of it, so I did.
if you want me out, just tell Beckman and she will reassign me.
why would I do that?
I need you. I just had to be sure that the ring hadn't gotten to you already.
and now do you believe me?
every word, Sarah.
how are you feeling?
um, much better, thanks.
sorry about that whole airsickness episode. It wasn't my finest hour
no, it's okay.
Chuck, I'm gonna be here for a couple of days clearing things up.
I would love it if I could show off the Eiffel Tower to you.
Absolutely. That would be amazing.
great.
Chuck, our Paris station is taking over custody of the ring operatives.
they send their compliments.
fantastic. That is great news. - Another thing, stay on the plane. We need that key back in Burbank ASAP.
Really? I can't...?
mission's over, Chuck. Time to come home.
what is it?
um, the install job I was gonna do here in Paris has been canceled, so Buy More needs me back immediately.
I have to stay on the plane.
what about Paris?
don't worry about it. It's-it's no big deal.
I'll get back here eventually.
and, uh, and furthermore, uh...
Hannah, if, um, if you ever find yourself in Burbank, and I don't know what the chances of you finding yourself in Burbank are, but if you do find yourself in Burbank, and you're still without a job, my assistant manager owes me about a million-and-a-half favors.
although, I have to warn you, you will be terribly overqualified for the job.
thank you.
Oh, you're welcome.
it was a pleasure to meet you, Hannah.
it was great to meet you, too, Chuck.
Bye.
au revoir.
Lester, dude, what are we going to do?
about Morgan and his new goon?
Yeah. How are we gonna get back at him?
morgan Grimes is the kindest, warmest, most understanding human being I've ever known in my life.
whoa, that is too cool.
how did you do that?
don't ask. Plausible deniability.
plausible deniability. Yeah, of course, of course.
your key, sir.
very good, Chuck. Your first solo mission.
I am impressed.
well, thank you, but I would be dead if it wasn't for you guys.
all right, who wantsto see if this key works?
what is it, a weapon?
no, it's a lockbox.
belonged to a spy I had inside the ring.
it's all of the intel the agent had.
with this we might stand a chance.
and one of our best didn't die in vain.
what's in the envelope, Shaw?
she was killed by a ring agent five years ago.
her name was Evelyn Shaw.
we both made the same mistake, Sarah.
we fell in love with spies.
what's with the looks?
he gave me a raise.
inflation, buddy. See what happens when you go away for a two-day install?
everything changes.
Ah, I don't know.
sometimes I think everything just stays the same.
but maybe that's just me.
Chuck, what happened on the install?
nothing, buddy.
nothing at all.
bored now.
there's only one piece left to clean up.
Perry. Chuck has to kill him.
you are giving him his red test tonight?
U kidding me? Kill him here, now? I can't do that.
then you won't become a spy.
you passed the test. To them you killed Perry.
no one can know the truth ever. Not even sarah.
you're now officially an agent.
included there's a plain ticket to Washington, you'll leave tonight.
D. N.I. headquarters First day. Don't be nervous. Don't be nervous.
what floor? Five. No, not five.
Oh, hey, uh, I'm so sorry to bother you.
you wouldn't happen to know what floor General Beckman is on?
they told me at the front desk and I-I just totally forgot.
that's good. I'm glad we did that. No!
sir? Excuse me, sir.
this is a restricted floor. I need a badge and a signature.
sir, I can't let you examine a body without an authorized NSA badge.
would you do me a favor?
just... one step.
there, perfect.
what do you think you're doing?!
it's done. Package is intact.
NSA, General Beckman's office. Please hold.
here we are. Thank God.
how's it going?
super.
hello. Thank you for waiting. Yes, I'll put you right through.
excuse me. Hi, my name's... -Have a seat, Agent Bartowski.
the General knows you're here.
right. Yeah, of course she knows I'm here.
Oh, God, these things are incredibly uncomfortable.
is there a particular place that you like to put this?
cause I'm always having...Oh, right, yes.
sorry about... Finger always on the slide, and you know, totally empty so...
but I hear you. Safety first.
a pleasure as always, General.
the pleasure's all mine, Diane.
Mr. Bartowski. Oh!
for God's sake, put that gun away. You're a spy now.
well, that's, that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about, General.
your first assignment just arrived.
the CIA wants you in Rome right away.
uh, what? Excuse me, right away?
Mm-hmm. You will be posing as a independently wealthy young expatriate.
that way, your jet-setting lifestyle and influential associates won't draw attention.
here is where you'll be staying.
obviously, you will be afforded all the accoutrements that go with it:
cars, clothes, a yearly stipend.
huh? What? Yearly? Yearly stipend?
this is all moving very, very fast, don't you think?
the NSA has spent three years and countless millions of dollars helping you reach your potential. There's nothing fast about it.
I get that. I do. I do, General, and I certainly don't want to come across as being ungrateful for the, the villa or the car or the stipend.
I'm just not sure that I am really ready to pack up and move somewhere to live this whole new life when I'm just starting to become comfortable with the life I'm living... right now, you know?
what exactly did you think we were training you for, Mr. Bartowski?
I don't... I don't really know what to say, General.
I'm sorry. Is not an option!
I understand that the hand-wringing and the second-guessing are all part of your process.
here's what I'm offering:
take the week off, anywhere you want, on us.
but afterwards, I expect you back in Washington and ready to assemble your team.
is that understood?
hang on. Um, back up a second.
what do you mean by"my" team?
you didn't think we were going to send you to Rome alone?
you'll have your pick of our top agents, whoever you want.
so where will we be sending you, Mr. Bartowski?
Bali? Bora Bora?
Burbank.
 Bob Hope Airport, to be exact.
I see. And will you be requiring a companion ticket?
no, thanks. She's still there.
that's, uh, that's fantastic news. Okay.
thank you.
enough of the suspense, babe.
one word, Devon: Africa.
Africa?
that was the hospital.
I didn't even have to ask.
out of the blue, they just offered me a sabbatical.
I have a year off. Do you know what that means?
africa.
we can do Doctors without Borders, follow our dreams, whatever you want.
what about Chuck?
Chuck is moving on, you know?
I really believe that this time.
he said he was on a business trip for Buy More in Washington.
Yeah, yeah, he did sound pretty pumped when I talked to him.
who knows where he'll end up.
who knows?
honey, there's nothing keeping us here.
africa.
I've never had to win a girl back, buddy, so I stopped by the store on the way here.
I got Sarah a bunch of stuff.
what do you think? Am I overdoing it?
you think I'm overdoing it. I'm overdoing it.
I know, I know, you're right.
it just finally clicked for me, you know?
Sarah is, is the most important thing.
I mean, what's the point of being a spy without her?
I've got to win her back, and I've only got a small window of opportunity to do it in before I have to leave for Rome.
Hey. Did you just say you're gonna go to Rome?
Yeah, my new assignment starts there next week.
then you are still leaving. Thank God!
I just fed Ellie some story about you working for Buy More corporate.
she won't go to Africa if you're still here.
well, I'm not going anywhere without Sarah.
then let's get you two kids back together.
shouldn't be too difficult, huh?
you seen the stallion she's dating?
Casey, do you...? Do, do you ever knock or use a door?
Shaw's not some geek who likes to talk about his feelings all day long. He's a real spy.
Oh. Oh, really? Is that so?
well, apparently, you haven't heard because you no longer work for the United States government, but I'm heading up my own undercover operation.
in Rome. And I get to choose my own team.
Really? Anyone?
including a civilian with extensive military background?
take a number, Casey.
Chuck, I speak fluent Italian.
menu items mostly. I'd be an invaluable asset.
listen, guys, I got to get Sarah back first.
then we can start talking about a team.
what are we waiting for, fellas?
let's help the guy get his girl back. Come on!
Yeah, so Ellie and I can go to Africa.
and I can get out of Burbank.
I can finally go see Rome.
maybe meet a nice Italian girl.
see the Vatican... pay my respects to the Pope.
what are you waiting for, lover boy?
Hey, um...
you're back.
I've been calling you for, for a couple days now.
you know, there's a lot we need to talk about.
I know. I'm sorry.
it's been a little...
crazy. Yeah, I know.
Beckman flew me to D. C.
I got my badge. It's official now. I'm an agent.
Congratulations. You earned it.
you know the CIA-- they're sending me to Italy.
you wouldn't believe the villa that they're putting me up in.
I'm supposed to be some rich young playboy.
but who cares about that? The point is, Sarah...
I want you to go with me.
Chuck, I can't.
no, Beckman said I get to choose my own team, cream of the crop. That's you.
I'm going to Washington, okay? And I'm going with Shaw.
wait a minute. Wasn't this the plan?
there's nothing stopping us from being together now.
I passed my spy test.
that's why I can't be with you, okay?
you're not... you're not the same guy that I fell for.
how? Why? Because I'm an agent now? How am I not the same guy?
you killed somebody, Chuck. I saw you kill the mole!
Sarah, I know what you think you saw on the train tracks, but it's not that simple. It's more complicated than that.
and I need you to believe me.
I don't.
I hope I'm not interrupting.
congratulations on your promotion, Special Agent Bartowski.
thank you, sir. Thank you. Yeah, it's, uh...
it's very exciting.
so what brings you back to Burbank?
um... I, uh, you know, just, uh, just-just tying up a few loose ends.
actually, Chuck was just wondering if I had any last-minute advice on his new assignment in Rome.
well, you shouldn't have come to her.
you should have come to me.
I was stationed there for two years.
come on. I can tell you everything you need to know.
Oh, great.
Hey.
how'd it go with Walker?
because she thinks I killed the mole, she believes I'm no longer the guy she fell in love with.
I have to tell her the truth.
what? That I killed him? Not gonna happen.
Casey, you said it yourself. The guy was a traitor.
Yeah, well, according to Beckman, so am I.
I'm lucky she didn't put a bullet in my head.
get her back some other way.
well, what the heck am I supposed to tell Sarah?
tell her whatever you want, just not the truth.
you like being a full-fledged spy, don't you?
you like that nice villa the CIA picked out for you in Rome, hmm?
then you killed the mole. That's how it's got to be.
okay, okay. How did it go? How did it go?
crashed and burned.
Chuck, did you tell her how you feel?
forget it. She's leaving with Shaw in the morning.
I'm sorry, guys. It's over. I'm going to get some fresh air, and figure out how I'm going to tell Beckman I'm quitting.
there goes our chance to ever get out of the Buy More.
Really? Is that what they teach you in the Marine Corps?
roll over and die?
this isn't exactly combat, Morgan.
that's where you're wrong, Casey.
because love? Love is a battlefield.
Hey, fellas. Need your help.
actually, Chuck needs your help.
went and lost his old lady again, huh?
Yeah. How did you know that?
we know everything.
the eyes and the ears of the strip mall, my friend.
Chuck better move quick if he wants to get his froyo ho back.
another fella sniffing around the orange. Orange.
guy knows how to fill out a pair of slacks.
if you know what I'm saying.
no, I don't. I didn't notice that.
you want us to put a tail on blondie's new piece?
find out his weaknesses, see what skeletons are in his closet?
blood sample, urine? Stool?
no. No, not at... I just...
I just need to borrow something.
what the crap is going on?
you guys scared the bejeezus out of me.
we're here to help you reacquire Agent Walker.
guys, listen. You don't understand.
no, Chuck, you don't understand.
you're not the only one with something at stake here, Chuck.
Yeah, we help you get the girl back, you help us get out of Burbank.
think of it as a test run for Rome.
what do you think, boss?
Hey, get dressed. Reservation's in ten minutes.
reservation for what? Come on.
guys. Is this Jeff's van?
go, go, go!
darn, he's on the move.
guys, what are we doing here? It's Shaw's date.
Wow. That guy can fill out a pair of slacks.
Sarah's with a stallion. Huh.
don't listen to him, Chuck. We have a plan.
you've got nothing to worry about, man.
target is in position, sir.
looks like a romantic dinner. Sorry, Shaw.
1990 Chateau Latour. Excellent choice.
knowledge of fine wine. Very classy.
he just ordered for both of them.
that's a power move, bro.
Yeah. Guy's a closer.
guys, guys. A little sensitivity would really go a long way.
just a smidgeon. A skosh. A dab.
we're talking about the girl I love here.
I'm sorry.
what could you possibly be sorry for? This is amazing.
it's just...I'm sorry that we haven't done this sooner.
this is nice.
no, it's perfect. Being here with you.
to a new life and a fresh start. No Burbank, no baggage.
all right, this isn't good.
why doesn't John here just drag him out of there?
I'm afraid my days of legalized body snatching are over, guys.
I'm a civilian now. This one's on you, Bartowski.
all right, Chuck. Whatever you do, do not go in there too hot.
you will scare her away.
negative. Okay? Chuck has to lay it all on the line.
Shaw, he may be handsome and worldly and know his way around a menu, but, man, he's stiff as a board. Where's that Bartowski charm?
the pizzazz? You flash a smile, you go in there and you...
Morgan, why don't you let me handle it? Okay?
no offense, but I've had my fair share of ladies.
cause you live in a bubble.
okay? Take a look at yourself.
go ahead. It's a freakish bubble of handsomeness.
now, look at me. No bubble. No bubble.
I got to be completely verbal.
now, Chuck, I'm telling you, you just go in and you be fun and you be witty, and you be the charming guy she fell for. Yeah?
okay. Okay, fine. But what about Shaw?
just worry about the girl. I'll take care of the stallion.
sorry to disturb you, but, Mr. Shaw, you have a phone call.
target's on the move.
agent Shaw. I'm an operative of The Ring.
if you want to save everyone in this restaurant, you will listen to my instructions very carefully.
you will do everything that I say.
where the hell do you think you're going?
exit the restaurant. Side door. And head to the back alley.
we've lost visual on the target.
bring up the phone dub.
stay cool and nobody will get hurt.
who the hell is that?
is this seat taken?
Chuck, what are you doing here?
I'm here for you.
what do you want me to say?
I want you to say that u'll come with me to Rome.
well, you know that I can't, and you know why.
look, Sarah, I don't want to have to make a scene in front of all these very nice people, but I will literally do anything to change your mind.
well, then tell me what really happened at the train tracks.
if you didn't kill the mole, then who did?
look, I don't want there to be any secrets or lies between us, ever again.
so, please, let me just have this one.
and I promise I will never lie to you.
there you will head to a pay phone.
the southwest corner. Do it.
but do it slowly. Slowly.
not one of ours.
take him down.
we know exactly what you look like, Shaw.
6'2," 220, black hair, very attractive.
next move, you're to wait for a phone call.
might not happen right away.
so be patient. And then, when you...
do you have any idea who these people are?
what they're capable of?
Nope?
listen.
I know that you think I'm not that same guy that you met the first day at the Buy More. And you know what?
you're right. Okay? You're right.
the guy that I was back then hated himself for not knowing what he wanted to do with the rest of his life or who he wanted to spend it with, but now?
finally, now... I know. I want to be a spy.
and I want to be with you.
Hey, it's just a harmless prank.
listen, you have to understand...
who are they? Is that a taser?
man down. I've been tased.
I can't feel my legs. Bring a stretcher, a wheelbarrow.
possible change of pants.
Casey, you got to do something. He's gunning for Chuck.
I'm a civilian now. I can't.
well, I can.
if you're going to shoot me, just do it.
put a bullet in my head.
bullet?
the director wants to meet with you face to face.
what are you saying?
Sarah, I'm saying... that I...
next time, take out the guy with the gun.
jail? Seriously, you guys? Jail?
I mean, Morgan, I would have expected this from you.
or even from Casey, now that we have all been privy to your public indecency problem.
but, Devon, I never expected this from you.
no, babe. I am so sorry.
you know what? Just save the apology. Okay?
I want answers.
I want the truth. I want you guys to tell me everything.
the truth?
Yes.
the truth is...
we were, uh, helping Chuck.
Chuck is in D. C. Casey.
well, he was. He's back to win back Sarah, so...
hold on for a minute.
you guys expect me to believe that the three of you got my husband beat up and tossed in jail to save my brother's love life?
Yes. Yes, we did.
we're as shocked as you are.
and, what's more, Chuck came to you three for advice.
before me. Yeah. -Yes, he did.
why am I not surprised this ended in jail?
agent Shaw, we have just received intel that the Ring agent who tried to capture you is the same man who removed a data drive from inside the mole's body.
the data was inside him?
he was in the process of digesting it when he was killed.
I'll spare you the gory details.
lucky he was dead first.
we believe the stolen data drive contains highly sensitive case files.
your new mission is to bring back those files.
general, if I may, -it's not good enough. -Excuse me, Agent Shaw.
you have a better idea?
the Ring agent we encountered did not want to kill me.
he wanted to take me to the director.
if the Ring wants to take me, let them.
you're volunteering to be a double agent?
I'm volunteering to be a bull's-eye.
I'll paint a target on the Ring from within.
I can get close to the director and track his location.
and then what?
it's your call, General, but I'd suggest you launch an air strike.
shouldn't we stop and ask what the Ring wants with you in the first place?
and why they want you alive?
it doesn't matter.
we can decimate the Ring's command structure with a single mission.
I see the merits. But you do recognize the danger?
general. This is the moment I've been waiting for...
we've been waiting for.
a singular opportunity.
whatever the risk may be, I say it's worth it.
very good. Make it work.
I would.
well, what if I don't let you?
it's not your choice.
Hello?
I believe you've been looking for me.
I'm ready to come in.
it's done.
Ellie, hey.
um, look, I can explain. - Chuck, listen to me.
no. I know exactly what you're going to say.
and you're absolutely right. It was completely immature of me - to get everyone involved like that. - Chuck, you're not listening.
stupid? Maybe stupid's the word you're looking for.
I get it. I went too far. - You didn't go far enough, Chuck.
Sarah is special. I know it. You know it.
if you love her, if she's the one, then you don't stop.
you don't quit. You never go too far.
you are a Bartowski, Chuck.
start acting like one.
Shaw, please. You're moving too fast.
you're not thinking this through.
Hey, we're spies, Walker.
let's start acting like it.
but you don't have to do this.
there's got to be another way.
it's the only way to be sure.
I have to do this. I'm sorry.
what's that?
it's how you'll find me.
this will give Beckman the coordinates for the air strike.
you just...You just swallowed that thing whole, huh?
no-no water to wash it down.
take care of her, Chuck.
where is he going?
Shaw is turning himself in to the Ring.
he's leading us to them.
he's sacrificing himself, Chuck.
I never should have let Morgan lay his dirty little hands on Loretta.
she's a sweet van, my friend.
that van's my retirement, dude.
and they took the van and they left us.
that is a slap in the face.
it's insulting.
do they have any idea how much stalking experience I have?
it's true. And this is my Blue period.
good. There's the guy.
blondie's new boyfriend.
we need to demonstrate our worth. Jeffrey.
show them that we can stalk with the best of them.
what do you say, my friend?
let's do the dizzle.
Shaw's going on a suicide mission?
I don't care what he says. I am not letting him go in alone.
he's not going in alone.
Chuck, what are you doing? Shaw needs help.
I know he does.
and that's why I'm going in to bring him back.
but the air strike is on its way. You're both going to get killed.
why are you helping him?
cause I know how much you care about him.
glad you could make it.
the director's expecting you.
be cool. You think he saw us?
never.
frisk him.
Stalkee is behind a gray van with another male, possibly for a sexual encounter.
both men are physically fit.
should be lively.
don't make me afraid to be alone with you.
in case you swallowed a tracker.
rather err on the side of caution.
they're much quieter when they're dead.
what do we have here?
now we can go see the director.
this is the exact model our federal government uses when cleaning up hot zones.
murder investigations.
so, does this model come with any rebates?
huh?
Morse code.
got to run. It's on the house.
Lester, I'm in the middle of something right now. I can't talk.
Oh, yeah. No, no, no, no. No worries. No worries, buddy.
I, too, am a little bit busy.
uh, stalking Sarah's new stallion, as Jeffrey would say.
you got to be kidding me.
hang up the phone.
I've been insulted enough.
wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, no, no, no.
you guys are stalking Sarah's new stallion?
well, can you see him right now?
no, we're tucked behind a dumpster. But it did look like the Stallion and some frat guys were heading into a dingy warehouse or something.
dude is into some kinky stuff.
okay. Listen, Lester.
I need you to tell me where you are right now.
it looks like we're at the corner of 2nd and Alvarado.
Hey!
Oh, thank you, Casey.
I haven't used Morse code since basic training.
I use it all the time to talk to my Marine buddies. What's up?
okay, Shaw gave himself up to the director, and Chuck locked me in here because he knew I would try and rescue him and Beckman's going to bomb the location.
Shaw dies an American hero. - Not if I can help it.
okay, good. He's still on the move. Thank you, Casey.
I'm sorry. I can't let you stay in here.
now, Casey.
Hey!
where is he?
nice to see you, too.
suspects have entered the building.
that is incredible. You guys are, like, the most amazing stalkers I've ever seen.
I will tell my grandchildren about you.
wait. Wanna borrow some brass knuckles?
Nunchuks?
uh, why would you even have...No. While I appreciate that,
Jeff, very much, I-I-I don't believe in violence.
so, should they give you a beat-down, you expect us to have your back?
no, thanks. - Okay. See you later.
tracker's gone subterranean.
location is stabilized and remains fixed.
agent Shaw has arrived and the B-2 has been deployed with bunker-busters.
what do you want to do?
drop the bombs.
and Agent Shaw?
he's a true American hero.
welcome, Daniel.
I've been waiting to meet you for a long time.
if you're going to kill me, get it over with.
I don't want to kill you, Daniel.
I want to educate you.
what is this?
a gift.
the answer you've been seeking for all these years.
Max, who loves you...
happy birthday.
okay, my turn. Give me the camera.
maybe it was a bad idea to get you a video for your birthday.
you i Now you're just wasting tape.
this is ridiculous. Happy birthday.
how'd you get this?
we have lots of information on Eve.
just watch, Daniel.
it's time you learned the truth about your wife's murder.
thought you might like to see some surveillance footage from that night.
No!
it must be so difficult for you.
you didn't think I'd come here in person.
I'll be in touch.
three minutes to target.
huh. No flash necessary.
good tranqs.
Freeze!
drop it.
congratulations, Agent Walker.
we destroyed a Ring compound, hopefully eliminating some of their higher-ups, and you managed to rescue Agent Shaw.
once again, you and your team prevail.
I can't take any of the credit, General.
it was all Chuck. He saved Shaw by himself.
duly noted.
well, Agent Walker, it's been a highly memorable three years in Burbank.
I look forward to working face-to-face with you in Washington.
have a safe flight.
how's Shaw doing?
he's still unconscious, but the doctors say he'll make a full recovery, thanks to you.
well, I mean, you know he would have done the same for me.
look, I don't want to pester you, Sarah, or become some, some nuisance that you can't avoid.
I've seen Morgan go down that road far too many times to count.
and since I've already given the fancy eloquent version of this speech before, right now I'm just gonna be blunt and honest.
I love you.
one more time just because it feels really nice to say: I love you.
I feel like I've been bottling this up forever. I love you.
Chuck, you don't have... - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm getting out of hand, but...
look, you were right in Prague.
you and I-- we're perfect for each other, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you away from everyone else and away from this spy life.
Chuck, I've made a commitment, and not just to Shaw.
don't go.
don't do it. Leave with me instead.
today at 2: 00, Union Station, we go to Mexico, and after that, anywhere that you want.
I would, however, like to go and see the Eiffel Tower at some point if that's at all possible. Don't answer now.
don't say a word.
I don't want to have to convince you.
I just want you to show up.
I'm gonna kiss you now...
if that's okay.
I'm gonna go home to pack both summer and winter wear.
I love you, Sarah Walker.
I always have.
this is Shaw.
you got a sec?
uh, yeah, sure. Come on in.
uh, can I get you a drink or anything?
no, no, I can't stay. I just wanted to come by and tell you something about Bartowski.
no, he didn't send me. He doesn't know I'm here.
I just wanted to tell you something in case it changed anything.
he didn't kill the mole.
what?
I did.
he didn't have the stones to pull the trigger.
the kid's not a killer.
just not wired that way.
unlike us.
just thought you should know.
see you around.
yeah?
thank you.
you have a nice life, Walker.
Hey, Washington will have to wait. We have a trace on the Director.
I have the details in the car. Come on.
well, I need to call Chuck.
there's no time. You can do it from the car.
Chuck, we have an urgent situation.
our forensic team was able to recover this video from the wreckage of the Ring's bunker.
the woman is Agent Eve Shaw, Daniel Shaw's deceased wife.
well, this is all very touching, General, but what does it have to do with Sarah?
keep watching.
the data drive the Ring recovered from the mole's body,
that's Sarah.
Sarah killed his wife. Did you know?
I assure you I had no knowledge that Agent Walker was responsible for Eve Shaw's death.
if Shaw has seen this...
if the Ring played him this video...
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. General, where is Sarah now?
we believe she's with Agent Shaw.
do you have any idea where Agent Shaw might have taken her?
I still don't have a signal.
Daniel, where are you taking us?
to settle an old score.
Hi, I'm Chuck. Here's a few things you might need to know.
you're not the same guy that I fell for.
how am I not the same guy?
you killed somebody, Chuck.
he didn't kill the mole.
what?
I did.
it's time you learned the truth about your wife's murder.
No!
if the Ring played him this video...
Oh, my God, General, where is Sarah now?
I believe she's with Agent Shaw.
Daniel, where are you taking us?
to settle an old score.
okay, just give me 20 seconds.
are you sure about this?
NSA picked up the Director's signal.
this is his broadcast point.
if they're right, Sarah, the Ring's most senior operative is behind that door.
cover me.
Hey, buddy.
Hey. Hey, hey, buddy. Where's Casey? Haven't seen him.
I have been thinking about this whole unofficial member of Operation Bartowski and I'd like to make it official.
Yeah, you know, I'm kind of in the middle of something...
Spyish? I know. That's my point, dude.
let me help.
I want to be part of the team. Okay, fine. Help me find Casey and you're part of the team.
operation Bartowski? I could actually...
not so loud. - Not so loud, right.
it's just great news, you know, because, listen,
I could be your second in command slash personal assistant.
Batman needs Alfred. Bond needs Q. Chuck...
Hey, hey, hey. You need me.
Morgan, I need Casey right now.
well, Chuck, per my excellent peripheral vision...
which is a valuable spy skill I might add...
I can tell you that one John Casey is now exiting the restroom.
Oh, thank you. Great.
you're welcome. So I'm a spy? That's it? Official?
Yes, you're a spy. Gotta go.
I am a spy.
Walker killed Shaw's wife?
it was five years ago. It was her Red Test. Sarah didn't know.
Beckman didn't know, but Shaw, he knows.
now, he and Sarah have disappeared on some mission.
they're off the grid. They can't be raised. They're gone.
Chuck, I'm not an agent. You shouldn't be telling me any of this.
but you know what to do, Casey.
okay, Beckman told me to just sit tight.
you and I know I can't do that.
Sarah just activated her locator. She's in trouble.
come on, man! You know how I feel about her.
call this number. Request Tactical Support.
you'll be forwarded to a Colonel Sanders.
don't make fun of his name. You want air, armor... everything.
... video camera for your birthday.
I had no idea you were going to use my present against me.
happy birthday.
I love you.
Oh, my God.
I love you.
all right, one more time, just so we're clear.
we have to reacquire Agent Walker.
nothing can happen to her.
do I make myself clear?
Yes, sir.
this is Team Leader. Is everything set?
men Air is go. Mechanized is go.
tactical is go. Airborne is go.
all right, boys, let's do this.
I'm going first.
Shaw. What is going on?
what is this? This is my Red Test.
why would they have my surveillance footage from my first kill?
just take a breath.
this is the worst moment of my life up there on that monitor.
I love you.
mine, too. - What?
Why? Who is she?
I killed your wife?
you had no idea that the Ring was behind this.
Shaw, I killed your wife. - This isn't your fault.
I thought I was a good spy.
this isn't your fault.
hey... it's okay.
go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
move! Move! Move!
the perimeter's surrounded.
man What's happening in there? Target's secure?
this is Team Leader. Cancel air support. Cancel tactical.
and the tank, the tank! Cancel the tank.
who on Earth gave you the authority to call in a full tactical assault?
I don't know what to do with you, but I know you're not ready.
but, General, it was Sarah.
come on. I had to...
you want to see the bill for your rescue mission?
it's longer than my copy of Atlas Shrugged.
look, you and I both thought the worst.
that Shaw had gone rogue. That he was going to...
kill Sarah?
Shaw. Sarah. Listen...
you thought I betrayed my country?
general, Chuck's actions were those of a true spy.
he was looking out for his partner and the Agency.
I would have done the same myself.
maybe without the stealth bombers, but perhaps that's just me.
are you doing okay?
Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you.
thank you for saving me.
I appreciated the tank.
general, did you check Sarah's records?
any clues as to who ordered her Red Test?
I'm afraid, Sarah, Langston Graham took that secret to his grave.
well, okay, General, then what are we supposed to do now?
we disband the team.
surely, you can't operate as an effective unit with this history.
general, if I may?
this isn't the first time they've used one of our own against us.
I want to make sure it's the last.
you're saying you can still work with Walker?
I can. We both want the same thing:
to capture the Director and take down the Ring.
are you with me?
can we still be a team?
Yes.
great.
everyone's back together again.
what is it, boy? My demo station don't cook by itself.
I, uh...
spit it out, son.
is it your mama?
it's Chuck.
is he okay?
Jeff and Lester, I could give a damn about them.
go ahead and fire them.
it's okay.
someone else? Who's the issue?
me. Me. I'm the issue.
this is tough. I'm quitting.
I found a job. A real job.
you can feel proud about it?
you're not selling your body?
you've got to go.
boy... I...
I can't show emotions like this.
those animals out there, they'll...
they'll get me if I do.
I think Morgan's dying.
I call dibs on his locker.
its location is far more prestigious than my own.
no, man. Those are tears of joy.
Morgan's leaving.
don't worry, John.
you will always have us.
and now, sans Morgan, we have room!
for what? - For you.
in our crew, buddy.
come on. Hands in!
you, you can let go of my hand now.
what is it, Bartowski?
general, if I could speak freely?
that's not a good idea.
as the titular member of Team Bartowski,
I think that it's crazy to be putting Shaw back in the field so soon.
he just found out that Sarah killed his wife, okay?
the guy's got to be an emotional train wreck right now.
nobody can control their feelings that well.
Chuck, what you are seeing in Shaw is an absolute professional:
something you are not.
that's why I'm moving them out of Burbank.
moving who out of Burbank?
Sarah and Shaw.
I'm proceeding with my original plan.
they'll head up our Ring task force in Washington.
and what about me?
you'll stay in Burbank until I know what to do with you.
where you going, sport? New job?
it's kind of secret.
you're going to work for Chuck.
I'm not a moron.
all right. Isn't it awesome?
can you believe it? Me, a spy.
and listen, when-when General Beckman lets you come back, me and you will be spies together.
Beckman doesn't forget a small thing like treason.
I'm really learning to enjoy my new life here.
are you kidding me?
John, your old life was so exciting.
the adventures, the missions, the weaponry, the women...
please stop. - Right. Got it.
learn to lock it down.
well, I'll tell you what.
I'm glad you're okay here, you know?
won't be the same without you. But, uh...
enjoy my old life.
you, too.
got some very exciting news. Are you ready? Hold onto your hat. I did it.
I...
what the heck is going on here?
are you mixing gaming with whiskey?
she's leaving, man.
leaving with the other guy.
no, this cannot happen. This cannot happen.
I thought I stood a chance, you know?
Yeah, well, just...
okay, okay, buddy. Hand it over.
no. Let go. No.
you are on the precipice of emotional ruin here.
I'm already over the edge! - No, you're not!
soon you're gonna start quoting liberally from the works of John Hughes.
and then things are gonna go dark.
things are gonna go really dark, and I'm not gonna let that happen.
Morgan, hand over the bottle! - Never!
Yes, you will. - Make me.
I hope you're happy.
she said she couldn't be with someone who didn't believe in her.
well, I believed in her.
I just didn't believe in me.
dude, you are misquoting the line, and you are ruining Pretty in Pink for me. Now, just stop it.
put the cap back on the top of the bottle, and let's forget that this night ever happened. Okay?
I'm really good at that, dude. I've forgotten entire years, man.
what is happening?
Hey, Sarah. Chuck's in a, a bit of a low spot.
Yeah, yeah, I see that.
he found out that you're leaving with Shaw.
he's also eaten an entire carton of sugar-free mint ice cream, which is only concerning, well, when you factor in the large consumption of whiskey.
thank you.
Morgan, can you leave us please?
I forgive you.
great, now I hate this song.
look, I,uh...
I know what I look like.
the mint ice cream sobered me up pretty good.
Chuck, it's okay.
no, it isn't.
I thought I could save you.
I thought Shaw was bad and I was gonna save you, and we were gonna be together.
but that didn't happen.
Shaw's a good spy.
I get it, okay? I think everybody gets it. Shaw is amazing.
and you two are gonna go run off together and save the world.
and that's great news for the world.
but earlier on in my...
drunken haze...
I realized that I hadn't asked you a question.
really important question that I'd like to ask you now, if that's okay.
just once, for the record...
Sarah, do you love me?
I'm, uh, I'm in my underwear.
I'm sitting in my underwear, holding a plastic guitar.
there's a very good chance I'm making a complete fool of myself, isn't there?
Yes. - I should probably put some pants on.
no, Chuck.
Yes.
Wh... uh, what?
Chuck, I fell for you a long, long time ago...
so, yes. Yes.
wait, wait.
what about my Red Test?
Casey told me.
he told me that he killed the mole and that you couldn't do it.
and it was the best news that I'd ever heard because it means that you haven't changed.
you're still Chuck.
you're still my Chuck.
I, uh, I will be totally cleaned up by tomorrow.
well, you don't have time because we have a mission.
Shaw found the Ring headquarters.
it's a three-man op, and you're our third.
mission?
no problem.
Morgan, what are you doing?
right. Where are my manners?
we haven't even met professionally.
morgan Grimes.
agent of the CIA and an assistant to one Charles Irving Bartowski.
now, let's get to work here. You heard the lady.
there is a mission, and you are needed.
let's get you some coffee.
you okay, Chuck? - Huh, what, me? Yeah, good. Totally cool.
Yeah, ready to go. Everything is totally normal.
all right.
director has his own private elevator.
you two are gonna rappel down to it.
when the Director leaves, grab him; I'll pull you back up.
cool. Great.
you think he knows about us?
I'm just saying...
okay, ready?
don't worry about the warehouse or Beckman, Chuck.
I trust you completely.
Yeah.
okay, Shaw, we're in.
what's the matter?
um, I have a concern about Shaw.
while he, yes, is a very great spy, emotionally, the guy is Swiss cheese, okay?
Chuck, Shaw is one step closer to capturing the Director.
and I'm sure that is all he is thinking about, so don't even worry.
all right, Sarah, I'm accessing the elevator's controls.
gentlemen.
he's having a mental break. We're fish in a barrel.
sorry about that, guys. Little Ring company.
see, I told you he wasn't trying to kill us.
all right. I'm opening the hatch.
Oh, don't worry. It's a tranq gun.
okay, fine. Just sell that it's real.
right, of course. Ruthless spy.
you're gonna take care of most of them though, right?
Sarah, internal security system is detecting something moving toward the elevator.
looks like the Director's coming in early.
time to meet our bad guy.
one word and you're dead.
now, this is brazen.
that... that was four words.
kidnapping me in my own lift. Impressive.
but there's absolutely no chance you'll get the Cipher.
did he just say Cipher? - Yeah.
what do you mean? - Don't play dumb. You're better than that.
we've been building our own Intersect for a year. You know that.
of course. The Cipher is the Intersect's core processor.
fine, so it's here. So where exactly is it?
you won't get five feet from this door.
my security will be on you in seconds.
well, that's tough because either we get the Cipher or...
pull out your Ring phone.
what Ring phone?
you mean, this Ring phone?
Yeah, that Ring phone right there. Call your assistant.
what? - You know, your secretary. Whoever you have.
call him or her, have them bring the Cipher to you here.
and put it on speakerphone.
you give her one warning, and I'm gonna...
please. I know the drill.
sir, you asked for this.
also, I spoke with Operative 6. They'll proceed with the coup in 15 minutes.
the Spanish Ambassador also called back with the ransom offer.
he wants to close by end of day tomorrow at the latest.
thank you, Denise.
and please text me when the plane lands in Barcelona.
Barcelona... it's a code.
Oh,"Barcelona's" a code? That-that's good.
what are we supposed to do with her now?!
well, personally, I'd shoot her.
decisions, decisions.
Shaw, what's going on?
just need a few more seconds.
well, we don't have seconds.
sorry, sir. One of our guys heard something strange in the elevator shaft.
Hi, welcome to the party. This is getting ridiculous.
I've got it. Here we go.
you know it's over, right?
what?
this was a trap.
for you.
okay, nobody move. We can all die here today.
you can all die here today.
personally, I have dinner reservations.
look at me.
do I look like an amateur?
no, you don't, but your partner here is a very different story.
not much of a spy, are you?
I am a spy.
Really? With a tranq pistol?
real gun too dangerous for you?
put it down.
sorry, Chuck.
Daniel... still upset about your wife?
you should really learn to get over that or take it out on Agent Walker here.
she pulled the trigger.
go. Take the service elevator to the fifth floor, then the north stairwell.
I'll get the Cipher. I'll meet you back at Castle.
Shaw, we're not gonna leave you here.
Sarah, go, please.
did he...?
you know, I think you're right.
good work, Daniel.
I think they bought it.
of course they did.
you weren't supposed to eliminate the Director, Shaw.
this wasn't a red op.
I did what I had to to get my team out.
that was a huge kick!
where did we...? Where'd you get this? Where'd we get this footage?
I tapped into the building security feed during the op.
wow, that's a hell of a roundhouse, buddy.
uh, General, I do think it's worth noting that we would all be dead if it were not for Shaw, so...
very well.
general, there's also the issue of the Cipher.
the Director said that the Ring was making a new Intersect.
relax. My team analyzed their Cipher and found a number of problems in the design.
obviously, the Ring isn't as far along as they thought.
looks like the Cipher's components were fabricated in France.
that's right, Shaw. I need you and Sarah to follow this trail to Paris.
we believe the Ring's design facility is there.
we can be in the air in 30 minutes.
excuse me, General.
uh, what, what about me?
sorry, Chuck, you're not ready.
we are never gonna get our chance, are we?
once I get back, it's all gonna happen...
you and me.
don't worry. Just one more mission.
Hey, look at you! Nice!
I take it you and Sarah are official.
now, the other guy, he's out of the way?
well, actually, Sarah and Shaw are on their way to Paris.
Beckman doesn't think I'm ready to be out in the field.
but other than that, everything's fine.
how is everything fine?
Chuck, I quit my job so I could join you in the field.
you did... you did what?!
you said I was a part your team.
that you were gonna speak to Beckman about me.
did you speak to Beckman about me?
of course you didn't. No, why would you?
I'm not a spy. I'm an idiot.
no, no, you're not an idiot.
I gave up a management position in a down economy.
Chuck, are you kidding me? None of that is gonna happen.
listen to me. Shaw's gonna get Sarah, okay?
and you're gonna go willy-nilly, tie me up again and drink yourself into Guitar Hero oblivion.
I may have said some unfortunate things about Shaw, but the fact of the matter is the guy's exactly what he seems: he's a hero.
that's nice. Good for him.
know what else he is, dude?
a stud, okay? And 99 times out of ten, that guy gets the girl.
we're done here!
buddy, Morgan, Morgan, look, I'm not supposed to show you this, but it was so awesome, I made a copy of it.
it'll help prove my point.
here we go.
okay, this is from the mission.
that is Shaw saving our butts right there.
wait for it. Wait for the roundhouse.
that's gotta hurt.
we have a problem. - What?
Chuck, look at this.
he pulls that punch.
and that roundhouse? It doesn't even land.
but he shot people, Morgan! Bad people!
did you see blood, viscera, brain matter?
Chuck, did you see brain matter?
okay, listen to me.
I have seen every Hong Kong fight film ever made, all right?
I direct your attention to my favorite Sonny Chiba poster.
I am the man when it comes to this. You have to trust me.
I can spot a fake action sequence from a mile away.
that's what we have here.
but if the fight was staged, that means that Shaw is working with the Ring.
and Sarah is with him.
I'm uploading the fight footage to Beckman's home computer now.
report, Chuck.
uh, General, I'm so sorry about the hour, but we just figured something out. Something very important.
agent Shaw is working with the Ring.
Chuck, how many times do we have to do this?
general, before, I was right for the wrong reasons, but this time I'm right for the right reasons, and-and I have proof.
Hi, there.
what is he doing here?!
well, uh, first of all, sir, uh, ma'am... Is it "sir"? What am I doing?
just talk! - Okay.
I'd like to thank you for this opportunity.
stop! What are you doing there?!
me? I'm with him. I'm on Chuck's team.
Oh, no. No, you're not because Chuck's not on his own team anymore.
I want you both out of Castle in five minutes!
Chuck, you are suspended!
No! No, no, General!
come on! She's blocking my call.
well, okay, my time as a spy was pretty exciting.
a bit brief, you know?
you're still a spy. - How's that, dude?
because right now I need a team, and you're all I've got, buddy, okay?
CIA or no CIA. We need to save Sarah.
just the two of us.
no, there is another.
so now they're in Paris, Sarah and Shaw.
and Shaw, this time for real, he is working for the Ring.
now, I know that you can't help me again.
I know all that.
but Sarah's gonna die without us.
I can't do this alone.
and I can't help you anymore. I'm not a spy.
but you are a spy! You're the ultimate spy!
was, Chuck, was.
but the man's been Buy More'd. - That's right.
you deluded yourself into thinking that Buy More's your life.
but wake up, John, okay?
cause we need you to get on this plane!
Chuck needs you to get on this plane.
I know this because I was that guy.
but Chuck and Sarah and you, Casey,
what about you?
Morgan, go to my closet and get me my suit.
the black one?
is this all of it?
this is everything I could find on Shaw.
I can't believe this is happening. She could be dead, Casey.
focus on the mission, will ya?
Windsor night
what is it? You just flashed.
it's a mission from ten years ago. It has nothing to do with Sarah.
I could flash on everything in here, and we'd still be at square one and have nothing.
I'm stuck in the air right now and there's nothing I can do about it!
Chuck, focus.
forget about the Intersect. Forget about being a spy.
it's what you have to do.
where are you, Sarah?
something is off.
what is it?
why did you bring me here?
what do you mean?
you led me here.
come on. This is where I shot her. Is this some kind of a trap?
Sarah... you killed my wife.
did you really think that I'd be okay with that?
but you said that...
I told you a lot of things to get you here.
the gun's getting heavy, isn't it?
you know, you could hurt someone with this.
there's a little cafe around the corner.
let's sit down, discuss the details.
just relax. It's all over now.
the drug is a special toxin.
it won't kill you. It simply immobilizes your nervous system.
I want you to see what's gonna happen next.
I need you to understand why I'm doing this.
so, Sarah, I see you've met my newest Ring agent.
Why?
well, I offered Daniel the chance to not only avenge his wife's death,
the CIA believed that Eve had been turned by us.
your boss Langston Graham assigned you to kill her.
you did what you were told.
I'm going to send a message to the CIA that they betrayed the wrong man.
very well put, Daniel.
they need to know what they did to me.
they need to feel the pain that I felt.
and that... is why I have to kill you.
on that note, do you have it with you?
the technical data should help your scientists complete the new Intersect.
thank you, Daniel. We'll be in touch.
do you need us to, uh...?
no.
I want to show her the river.
it's... beautiful at night.
well, good night, then.
good-bye, Sarah.
almost time to go.
how'd you find me?
I've read your file...
your wife's, every mission you've been on, every paper you wrote at West Point, every travel report.
you come here once a year in memory of your wife's death.
it made morbid sense that you'd want Sarah to see it, too.
smart. Very smart.
you're under arrest. Now, stand up.
less smart, Chuck.
you should pull the trigger.
now. Kill me.
I wouldn't do that.
I see you brought Casey.
Oh, yes, I did...
and he's currently taking care of your new Director.
and you've got me?
stand... up.
I guess the gun was his idea.
good.
no, Shaw, don't do this.
you can't flash, can you?
those emotions get you into trouble.
now, you just stay here. I don't want to hurt you.
none of this was your fault.
I haven't told them your secret.
but if you follow me...
I will kill you.
the drug will dull the pain.
you won't feel a thing.
stop!
I warned you.
please...
it doesn't have to be like this.
this isn't you, Shaw.
you can't do this.
happy birthday.
I love you.
no, Chuck, I can. You can't.
we've been over this.
you no longer work for me, John.
unless there's a sale at the Buy More, we have nothing to talk about.
then I guess you don't want to talk about...
my little friend here, hmm?
the Ring Director.
what do you want for him?
well... full reinstatement, my old rank back, and a new Crown Victoria...
and a request you're probably not gonna like.
it-it seemed like a good job, but I just...
couldn't cut it.
what I came here to ask of you is can I come back to the store, sir?
maybe? Just...
I'll see my way out.
not yet.
I couldn't bear to put the offer out there.
it's been here waiting for you.
don't worry, son.
you can always come home.
thanks a lot, Big Mike. - Dad.
Yeah.
Thanks, Big Mike. - Papi.
let's go with "Dad. " Thanks, Dad.
I like that one.
is this Morgan Grimes?
Yeah. Who dis?
this is General Beckman of the NSA.
I am calling to say that you are officially a member of Operation Bartowski.
you're not kidding me, are you?
this isn't some sort of mean prank or anything, is it?
no. We don't do pranks.
you can thank Colonel Casey.
okay, I got to go quit my job. Hold on a second.
don't do that. Your cover is the Buy More.
right. Right, that's perfect.
that's perfect. I'm good at that.
aye, aye, Captain.
general. It's General.
of course. General. General.
thank you... thank you, sir. Ma'am.
I will not let you down.
are you... Hello? Hello?
how you feeling?
Oh, what happened?
everything's okay now.
what about Shaw?
he's dead.
I'm sorry.
Oh, my God, we...
there was a... there was a cafe and...
and a bridge, and he tried to kill me, and...
Oh, my God, you shot him.
I couldn't let him hurt you, Sarah.
trust me, I did what I had to do.
but I'm still the same guy.
I'm still Chuck. I promise.
you saved me.
Chuck, Sarah, excellent work.
I've consulted with Colonel Casey, and he brought me up to speed.
I'll expect a full report when you get back to Burbank.
actually, General, I think we're gonna need a few more days in Paris.
no, I want you back ASAP. We have a new mission.
last night a team of Peruvian assassins broke into...
agent Bartowski?
agent Walker?
I've lost contact. Get them back.
I don't... - Then shut up and kiss me.
Hi, I'm Chuck. Here's a few things you might need to know.
your dreams are also proof of stress the Intersect puts on your brain, likely leading to serious mental deterioration.
Shaw, you're not bleeding anymore.
that's right, Chuck, I'm not.
what does that mean?
it means I'm still alive.
you work for the CIA? - This is about your father.
there are some very bad people looking for him, including a man named John Casey.
last time he left, he made sure that I had a way to contact him.
Hey, I contacted my dad. Can we meet?
Yeah, same place as last time, okay?
okay, I'll be there in ten minutes.
it was about Shaw.
no, I haven't told Sarah yet.
Yes, I realize that honesty is important in a relationship.
who do you think I am? Listen, just meet me at the Buy More in, like, ten or 15. Okay?
whose relationship are you talking about? Huh?
uh... Morgan's, Morgan's. Yeah, Morgan and Anna, the past
he's just been really tore up about her lately, so...
Oh, I thought he rejected her recently.
he did, he did, he did, but the heart is a... is a very, it's...
the heart is a very complicated muscle.
really, and you smell...
...fantastic, too.
Oh, hey, maybe that was just the Pop-Tart.
I got to go, bye.
Bye.
wait, wait, you dreamt Shaw was alive?
Chuck, you saw him die, though.
you checked for a pulse, right?
well, he fell into a river.
he fell into a river?! Of course Shaw's alive!
haven't you ever seen a John Carpenter movie?
buddy, are you going to help me or what?
Chuck, the thing is: if he's alive, then he knows everything about her and he knows everything about you, everything about me - where I work, where I live, what I eat, - shower... - Hey, buddy, hey, yo, Morgan.
this is why we are going to find him and figure out what he's up to, okay, but first I need to take care of a few things here.
remember, though, this is between you and I.
stay between me and you. Okay, no problem, absolutely.
listen, do me a favor: before you go, can you key me into Castle? I left something down there.
look, if you're really afraid of Shaw, I'll let you down there for a little while.
thank you. Thank you, you are a lifesaver, sir, literally.
Yeah, good, okay, fine, just-just don't touch anything.
okay? All right.
Yes, oh, baby.
what are you doing here?
is Chuck up to something?
I don't know, you tell me. You'd know better than I would.
Hey, have you seen, uh, where they keep the bulletproof pants?
you know, Morgan, you and I-we, uh, we never talk, really.
Yeah, well, talking's a bit overrated. Plus, we don't have a lot in common, although I'd like to get to know you better. I mean, I don't feel like there's...
sit. - Okay.
you're going to tell me exactly what's going on and you're going to do it right now.
no.
Chuck, we got a problem, bro.
Sarah knows about Shaw.
Yeah, yeah, I broke, man.
this gaze.
Morgan, how could you poss... W - what is, what...?
is that a bulletproof vest?
no, is that a bulletproof tie?
I don't...I don't know what... - Give me a break.
that's my dad.
why is my dad here?
he does not know that I downloaded the Intersect 2. 0.
w- W-W-Wait, wait, you didn't tell him?
well, he spent so much time getting the damn thing out of my ad.
why would I tell him that? Mush, mush, mush, mush.
Hi, hey, Dad, hi.
how are you? What, uh, what are you... what are you doing here?
your sister contacted me.
I wanted to check with you and make sure that everything was okay.
is that...?
that is John Casey. Of course, yeah, you know that he works here.
Why? He's an NSA agent, and if the Intersect project was disbanded, why would he...?
Sarah, you remember my father.
Oh, hi, Mr. Bartowski.
I - It's great to see you.
Oh, you've been out of the loop, so I can't expect you to know this, but-but Sarah and I are boyfriend and girlfriend now.
Hi, sweetie.
tell me that you're not in the CIA anymore. Tell me that you quit.
dad, the Intersect is out of my head. I've moved on.
I can assure you - we can assure you...
...that I am no longer a spy.
you know me, I wouldn't lie.
this is Incredible.
from the outside it looks like a regular office building.
right this way. - Okay.
so you were able to contact your dad?
you could say that.
perfect.
so, once he tells you where he lives, we'll be able to protect him and you can tell him everything.
what about John Casey?
if he's a double agent...
Ellie, he's been living in your building for three years, just observing.
there's no reason to think that'll change now.
but... this may put your mind at ease.
that's a speaker. I don't understand.
like I said, nothing's what it seems.
it's not really a speaker.
it'll protect you. It'll block all of Agent Casey's audio and visual reads on the courtyard, and, Ellie, if you ever feel nervous, even for a second, just call me.
you know you can trust me, right?
I do.
I think you should tell your dad the truth.
I mean, you need to be honest with the people that you love, and that goes for me, too
I know, I know, Sarah, I'm sorry.
but if you dreamt that Shaw was alive, then you dreamt it for a reason.
I mean, the doctor said that you're healthy and that your dreams could be as accurate as your flashes. Right?
ye... uh, yeah, yeah, that's right. Let's hope so.
I'm not letting you go to Beckman till we know for sure.
I ran a scan on all of Shaw's known aliases. No activity since Paris.
I think our best shot at finding him is Walker.
Why?
W - Why?
she has an... intimate knowledge of the target.
I think "intimate" is a-is a bit of a... bit of a stretch.
if Walker goes through all the places she went with Shaw, all the things they did, maybe you'll flash on something that leads to him.
would you be okay with that, Chuck?
of course. Of course.
so, what exactly did you and Shaw do when you were in D. C?
well, Walker, I have here a receipt from a waterfront restaurant named Le Jardin.
two chef's tasting menus, couple of nice bottles of Pinot...
doesn't sound like business to me.
after our couples massage, he took me to Tiffany's.
did he buy you anything? Please.
everybody knows that you go to Tiffany's to browse, not buy.
are those new earrings, Agent Walker?
okay, so, on March 22, you and Shaw were off - grid the whole day.
what exactly were you doing?
objection. Relevance?
what was so compelling that you didn't check in?
was it the penthouse?
Yes.
did you flash?
Shaw ordered the CIA to construct a TR-15 safe in his penthouse.
whatever he's hiding in there could lead us to him.
looks like we're going to get to see Shaw's bachelor pad, although for some of us, it won't be the first time.
excuse me. Yes?
please, stop.
awkward.
and cruel, but not incorrect, because you are not playing from your soul.
you're soulless in Seattle.
that's quite a wad of cash you hustled on Buy More property.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. This is our dream.
we're on break. You can't touch us.
I don't want to touch you.
I want to help you.
in case you forgot, I know a thing or two about management.
you're too good to be playing outside a chain electronics store.
if I was your manager, you might be playing inside a chain electronics store.
Yeah, we've already played the Buy More.
we don't need you. - I'm listening.
what?
having a manager means having respect.
how many times do I have to tell you? Art: good.
Commercialism: bad, evil, weird... chubby.
but you know what? I'm... I'm tired of it.
you want his empty words and his razzmatazz wordplay, you take it. You take it, and you go solo, and you see how that works out for you.
just try and stop me from walking away.
just try and stop me.
you just try.
you try and stop me from...
you're not going to even...?
that's what... you know what, fine.
but I'm ing to take something with me that you can never have back.
dad.
what is going on?
how did you get in here?
dad, I told you that I wanted to come to you.
you shouldn't...
what are you doing here?
why do my children always ask me that?
you're my daughter.
of course, I'm going to come to you.
Yeah, but... And this is safer.
okay? I-I-I... I thought you'd be happy.
I am. I'm happy. I'm happy.
I'm just... I'm surprised.
in a good way.
good.
Shaw was a part of our team for months.
he knows everything- all of our weaknesses-including this place.
I'm worried he's going to come after Ellie.
we don't know what he wants. - Exactly.
which is why I need your help.
I need you to look after her for me, make sure she's okay.
until we know what Shaw wants,
Ellie Bartowski has a second shadow.
steve No.
it's true.
dad, how do you even remember that?
I... you know, I remember a lot of things.
so, what do you guys want to do tonight?
Oh, actually, you know what, I've got a...kind of a date night with Sarah.
we're going to be staying downtown tonight.
sorry - it was kind of a last minute thing, so...
well, uh, it'll just be you and me, then.
it'll be great. We can talk about whatever it is you wanted to talk about.
Oh, no. You know what?
this is, uh... this is the hospital.
I... I got to go. I'm still tying up loose ends from that Africa trip.
you went to Africa?
Yeah. It's... it's such a long story.
I'll-I'll be back soon, okay?
stay here.
Justin, thank God you called.
my dad, he just surprised me.
he's here. - In Echo Park?
I thought you were getting his address.
he just showed up. What do I do?
John Casey's home.
okay. It's going to be fine.
meet me at Bellevue Square alone, and we'll figure out what to do about your dad.
okay.
so, this last-minute trip with Sarah
you're not going on some sort of a mission, are you?
dad, we just had a really nice meal, okay?
what's with all the spy questions?
because I don't know anything about your life, and I'm here, and I-I'm trying to figure out what I missed,
I see one thing.
Casey works at the Buy More.
Sarah lives with you, and...
this is an active surveillance wire. Okay?
and your computer is still tapped in to the CIA mainframe.
so, you tell me again, Charles, that you're not involved in anything dangerous, that you're... that you're not a spy.
okay, I will occasionally do some analysis work for the CIA. It's a desk job.
it's a glorified paper pusher. - Charles.
dad, I sit behina desk, and I input data a couple of times a month. It's nothing dangerous.
and this... this thing tonight with Sarah?
is really just a night away with my girlfriend.
you have nothing to worry about, Dad.
I'm just an analyst.
did your ears just pop?
Hey, it's me.
uh, I'm here and you're not.
I really need to see you.
Devon thinks that I'm at the hospital.
it's just... it's getting harder and harder to lie.
please call me, okay?
so, this is Shaw's penthouse, huh?
Yep.
great. I'll check over here.
I found the safe.
Where's the safe?
put these on.
how do... how do you... how do you get to it?
Oh, it's password-protected.
we're going to be here a while.
well, maybe we start with something common.
you know, birthday, pet's name... your name.
it's Shaw.
go, go, go, go!
wait, wait, wait, wait! No.
we need to know what Shaw wants first.
okay? You get the briefcase, I'll make the jump.
okay. Well, just be careful.
okay. Come on, Intersect.
what do you got for me?
this should be interesting.
Shaw is dead.
care to join him?
did you get him? Did you get him?
if you... if you did, make sure and check his pulse.
but help me first. - Okay, hold on. I'm coming, Chuck.
help me first before you check his pulse. Help me.
Sarah, he's coming back. He's coming back.
dad.
just an analyst, huh?
so, this is my office.
pretty... pretty sleek, huh?
why weren't you here, sitting at one of these computers instead of dangling from a rooftop?
why are you still lying to me?
dad, it's like... it's like I told you.
the government sees a lot of potential in me, you know, so General Beckman asked if I would work as an analyst for the CIA, and then every once in a while,
I'll still go off on, you know, a little field mission.
could you excuse me just for one second?
and please don't touch any of the computers.
cause I know you want to, but don't do that.
so, the guy on the roof - who was he?
couldn't get a good look at our mystery man from the building's security cam footage.
how'd he know about the loft?
best guess: when you accessed the penthouse, you triggered some sort of alert.
he was after this.
lockbox. Just like the one
Evelyn Shaw had.
okay, well, why does Shaw have one?
it's essentially a spy's last will and testament.
all spies keep a record of the information they might lose if they get killed on a mission.
in Shaw's case, all the information that the CIA has on the Ring.
my bet is they're going to want this back.
100 bucks says he's working for them.
and if the Ring is looking for this, then it must mean that Shaw is dead.
my name is Daniel Shaw, and if you are reading this, it means I'm already dead.
I was wrong.
wrong about what?
I've heard the name, Daniel Shaw, before.
he... he's a special agent for the CIA - a Ring expert.
I take it that's his lockbox.
what happened?
that mission's over, Dad.
no, it's never over.
there will always be another one and another and...
the reason a spy has to have one of those is because any mission they go on could be their last.
for every spy, there's someone who cares about them.
someone who has to open that box, read that message, and mourn their loss. This is a bad business.
and I don't want my family any part of it.
sorry I didn't make it to the square.
but the most pressing issue is what to do about your father.
do what? John Casey's watching us like a hawk.
that's why we've devised a new plan, but it's going to require some real spy work on your part.
you up for it?
my name is Jeff, uh, Jeff, Jeff That's right, I said my name is Jeff, uh, Jeff
that's good, son, but it might be a little...
lyrically lacking.
Hey, girl Whatcha got for me?
Oh, I see how it is Well, I don't need ya Your uterus won't fit my baby in it anyway My name is Jeff, uh, Jeff, uh, Jeff I'm the baddest man...
Hey, have you seen Grimes?
lost your friend, did you?
can't find him 'cause he's changed so much?
but you can't help but think about the days you guys used to drink together and hold each other for hours and hours, just talking about even the silliest little things.
those days are no more.
they're no...
don't you knock?
Shaw is alive, okay.
and he's bringing a reckoning with him.
Ah. No one told you, huh?
Shaw's dead.
no. No. Chuck said. He... Bartowski's wrong.
Oh, thank God. Thank God.
man, someone could have given me a heads-up here.
I've had to pee for, like, the last four hours.
but I'm not here for that.
listen, would Ellie cheat on Devon for any reason?
no, Ellie is not a cheater.
I tapped into her phone. She left this strange message.
I really need to see you.
Devon thinks that I'm at the hospital.
it's just... it's getting harder and harder to lie.
that's Ellie.
Oh, man.
so what's the deal?
you've done well, John, but you're a man who lacks tact and interpersonal skill.
okay, on behalf of the family,
I'll speak to the husband, all right?
this is not gonna be fun.
Devon, yeah, so you think Ellie's happy in your marriage?
of course.
Why? Did she say something?
no. No, not exactly, but I feel pretty confident that if there is something wrong, it's your fault.
so, take me through an average day, and then, you talk, I find the problem.
okay.
well, most mornings, I wake up around 6: 00,
I pop a towel in the dryer so it's warm when she gets out of the shower.
I'll whip her up a Belgian waffle, or, you know, goat cheese omelet.
something easy.
after Ellie's daily foot rub,
I'll bike to the farmer's market, pick up some fresh blueberries, or you know, whatever's in season.
come home, make her a smoothie.
organic nonfat milk, flaxseed oil.
you know, something to give her a real midday kick start.
I spend about 20 minutes just watching her sleep.
she looks so peaceful.
it's, like, what's she dreaming about, you know?
anyway, that's my day, give or take.
Yeah.
Hey, Dad.
is everything okay?
I - I just keep thinking.
without the Intersect...
...why would they let you go on missions?
I mean, you're-you're... you're an ordinary guy.
I'm not.
I'm not an ordinary guy.
the CIA wants me to work for them because they think I'm special.
cause they believe in me.
you're right, Charles.
you are special.
I knew it.
you downloaded the Intersect 2. 0.
you threw a knife at my face.
why would you do that?
after I worked so hard to get the first one out.
dad, knife! Face!
what if you were wrong?
I'm never wrong.
there's something that I never told you.
the Intersect
it can have a negative effect on the brain.
Hold-Hold... Hold on.
what? You... you knew?
you-you knew, and you didn't tell me?!
I didn't think I had to tell you.
you didn't tell me you downloaded the new one!
but that's because I knew you would disapprove of it.
and-and... you know what? And you left.
again.
you taught me and Ellie how to live life without you, and that's exactly what I'm doing.
I... I have to go.
right now.
what?
wait. Wait. Dad. Dad, where-where are you going?
I'm sorry.
I can't stay here and watch my son die.
dad?
you're-you're leaving?
weren't you going to say good-bye?
Oh. Sorry. I'm, uh...
I still don't even know what's wrong, why you wanted me here.
I just, uh... I missed you, and I wanted to make sure that you were okay.
Oh, okay.
well, you-you don't have to worry about-about me, this time,
I won't be gone as long, I promise.
okay. Okay.
take care of yourself?
I did it.
I planted the tracer.
nice work, Ellie.
you've guaranteed your father's protection.
Where's your dad?
he found out I was the Intersect, and he left.
Chuck, he must have had a good reason.
he loves you.
I know. I-I...
I know that he loves me.
he just doesn't know me.
he doesn't know anything about me.
why I became the Intersect, that-that... that I can help people.
did you tell him that?
no.
I guess I didn't.
but I can't talk to him now because he's gone, and I don't know where he lives.
I do.
it's gonna work.
I took this.
your misdemeanor aside, my dad is an incredibly paranoid person, and I'm sure that this isn't his real address. Oh, I know.
but it was issued by the Bishop County DMV, and I checked all the utilities databases, and this is the only house without cable, water and gas, but also consumes an incredible amount of electricity, so,
I'm pretty sure that's your dad's house.
Wow. That's so...
Spyish?
well,
I am a spy.
Yeah. We're at the house.
good. Don't call me again until you have it.
well, this must be it.
I'm just gonna go in there and tell him how I feel.
do you want me to come with you?
no, it's okay.
but if I'm not back in 20 minutes, you come save me.
okay.
where is it?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yes, you do.
my employer knows that you have an Intersect.
Where's the thing that's keeping you alive?
dad, it's me.
don't worry. I'm alone.
cut it. We'll make this look like an accident.
Oh, that. Oh, that. That-that's not safe.
that's not safe. He shouldn't be doing that.
Mr. Bartowski, this will all be a lot less painful if you tell me where the Governor is.
I don't even know what you're talking about.
not you. Your father.
what is he talking about?
the Governor!
it's the watch, isn't it?
no.
tie them up. Dad.
and let's clear out. We don't want to be here when this place goes up.
sorry about this. You shouldn't have come here.
I didn't want to drag you into anything.
dad... Dad I came up.
I came up here because I wanted to tell you why I downloaded the Intersect, that I'm... that I'm special, and that I can help people.
but given the circumstances,
I think I'm just gonna have to show you.
no guns! The gas!
that's a good idea.
does she have the Intersect, too?
no, Dad.
that's all her.
Hi, honey.
Hey, come in.
I don't know how the Ring found my cabin.
but I do know what they... what they came for.
I call it the Governor 'cause it sort of governs the Intersect.
see, I realized through the years that...
that, just like a computer, that th-the, the Intersect can overheat.
is that what's happening to me?
Yeah, see, your brain is like a circuit, and when you flash, it releases a surge of electrical energy, but if it's not controlled, it can lead to dementia a- a-and insanity, maybe even death, but I've been working on a fix
see, i-it, um, it governs my neural network and helps control the power of the Intersect, almost like a, uh, like a pacemaker would for the heart.
could something like that work for the 2. 0?
well, I couldn't tell you about it until now 'cause I needed to go back to my cabin to be sure, but, Charles, i-it will.
I'm gonna make you one.
you're my son,
you want to be a spy.
I'm gonna do everything I can to...
help you be the man you want to be.
Thanks.
thank you.
Lester, I want to help you be the man you ought to be.
it's too late.
Jeff will be huge here, then he'll be huge in Japan, and then it's over.
boy, don't you see?
the man made a banner that said "Jef
as if it were a question.
he doesn't know who he is without you.
you're more than just the 'ster in Jeffster!
you're the 'ster that stirs the drink.
I won't be fooled by corporate trickery.
I will never bow down to the man.
I'm not the man.
I'm a man...
a man who once had a dream, too.
I was Rain.
the 21st night of September? - My God.
I can't wear this anymore, but you have the hips of a six-year-old girl.
use them.
where do I sign?
excuse me, guys.
can I speak to you for a second, please?
excuse me.
Yeah.
I talked to Captain Awesome.
And?
if he'd have me, I'd let him.
if there's a problem here, it's on Ellie's side.
Hey, look, let me ask you something:
why are you even doing this?
I gave Chuck my word I'd make sure his sister was okay.
awesome is volunteering at the animal shelter,
Ellie is working the late shift.
the apartment should be completely empty.
perfect.
I'm gonna go take a look.
Justin Ellie, are you with your husband?
no, my husband's not home.
everybody thinks that I'm working.
no, it's safe.
you're sure?
Yeah, you can come here.
good, I'm already on my way.
Oh, okay, good.
there's someone in the house.
how close are you?
I'm close, but I may not get there in time.
go to the speaker.
okay.
now open it.
how?
press all three buttons at once and wait for a click.
Justin, no, I can't, I can't.
someone's in your house, Ellie.
he could hurt you, hurt your family.
now take the gun.
Ellie, wait!
Justin, John Casey... Don't worry, you're safe, come with me.
what's wrong?
I've been thinking about what happened at the cabin and...
how you almost died.
I want you to have this.
my spy will.
why are you giving me this?
and if something were to happen to me...
well, if anyone's going to have it, I want it to be you.
nothing's going to happen to you.
you're not going anywhere.
and neither am I.
you'll be safe here until we figure out what to do about John Casey.
I'm so sorry, I just... I couldn't, I couldn't...
is my dad going to be okay?
they're fine, I promise.
you've done everything we've asked, Ellie.
you've been incredibly brave, and trust me, this is almost over.
now wait here.
I'll be back soon.
my name is Chuck Bartowski, "and if you're reading this, it means I'm already dead.
I don't know what will end up killing me...
...but I've chosen to be a spy, "and there are consequences to that.
it may be my emotions that end up doing me in...
...or a slip-up, trying to protect my friends...
...or my family...
my team was captured.
this needs to happen now - no more waiting.
or it could be the thing I never saw coming, but I know it's coming.
Hey, I'm Chuck. Here's a couple of things you might need to know, maybe you just forgot.
we spared no expense re-creating the Buy More.
it's now a full-fledged CIA-NSA substation.
new Buy More? Rules.
slides. Doors. - And the new super-spy Herder Greta?
be still, my beating heart.
I think you have earned this.
the keys to the Buy More.
I'm making you store manager, Mr. Grimes.
maybe Awesome's right.
marriage, a baby...
who knows? Maybe we're next.
when's food? I'm hungry.
shut it, convict!
talking my ear off.
we can get ten miles, max, but no way we'll make Yucca Mountain.
we're being redirected.
new top-secret facility.
we're going where?
attention, gamers! Your patience is appreciated.
the midnight release of "Spy Attack" is less than two hours away.
somebody restacks these DVDs players.
and I need a lot more blank CDs.
no, not - get these consoles out of there!
guys, I need a lane going through here.
all right? I-I'v logged about listening skills last night.
did anybody watch? No!
and it shows.
I don't think you're taking this seriously enough, buddy.
Oh, I'm serious. I'm De Niro serious.
listen, the Buy More is CIA, and as the manager, I am the front line of the Buy More.
if things don't run smoothly up here, well, it's a national security issue.
I need a sidearm. Preferably like a Desert Eagle or some big.
you're beyond De Niro. This is Russell Crowe serious.
okay, but listen, Chuck, biggest game of the year drops tonight, and these fan boys have been camped out for a week.
a week - without their consoles and simulated killing.
weren't you camped out in this line last year?
Yeah, okay, fair enough.
but that means I know what they're thinking.
and they expect a full-blown, high-tech launch presentation.
all right, look, with just me at the helm, this is it, dude; my managerial Bushido test, okay?
and I'm ready. I want it.
and I don't need any help.
well, you know, if something was to go down, there is a CIA presence lurking about in the form of John Casey.
Oh! And the new Greta. - The new Greta?
Hello, Greta.
we're all set for the game launch, Mr. Grimes.
Ah, perfect. - Any further tasks for me?
filter, filter.
Nope. Nope. Carry on, well done.
lovely to meet you.
what?
where was I? I'm the manager.
I am the manager, national security, all that, yadda yadda.
and as much as I wish I could stay around and see how this all plays out, I have to catch a flight in an hour.
Oh, you don't say. - Private jet to Monaco.
Wow. Good for you, a whole week chasing some lazy oligarch down the French Riviera with your stunning girlfriend.
did I mention that, too?
buddy, it's gonna be the mission...
of a lifetime; I-I-I think you mentioned that, as well.
but hold on one second here.
what is with the unbridled enthusiasm? I love it, but where's the Chuck relationship neurosis?
Where's the hand-wringing and the, uh, mishegas?
well, I'd never speak for Sarah.
but, if forced to, I'd say that she's really, finally starting to settle down with me.
Wow. Let's pause. Be very still.
you are in a happy relationship, I'm peaking professionally.
let's savor it.
smells like victory.
what's eating you, Walker?
fighting like a pit bull, huh?
did it change anything?
finding out that you had a kid?
they say that your priorities change.
my priorities are the same: God, country, duty, Corps.
huh, all right, yeah.
sometimes I think about calling, but... Alex has her own life.
I just don't know what my role is. We done now?
what's with the interrogation?
Chuck let something slip last night.
about the future.
Oh, yeah? What?
kids? With you?
huh. Bartowski's the king of cool, huh?
I'm a spy.
I can't even process the idea of having kids right now, and I need to say something to him before he runs away with the idea.
Yeah, he's probably already measuring for drapes, wouldn't you say?
we're going on this romantic trip to Monaco, and he's gonna know that something's wrong.
Yeah. You know, he's gonna keep digging at you, too, till you give it up, and then he's gonna spend the rest of the trip moping.
harness your fury, Agent Walker.
your mission to Monaco with Agent Bartowski has been cancelled.
subtle, Walker.
prisoner transport headed to our Yucca Mountain Supermax was redirected to Castle.
the prisoners are ours until the transport is repaired or a chopper frees up.
whoa. Wait, wait, wait. What, cancelled?
monaco cancelled?
Sarah, it was supposed to be the mission...
of a lifetime, I know, Chuck, but there is a silver lining.
we get to stay in and have a quiet night, and, um... and chat.
I don't know if I'd exactly call that lining silver as much as copper, or zinc, or manganese.
I mean, we were supposed to be in St. Tropez as Lord and Lady Carmichael, all expenses paid...
unless there's something we needed to talk about, is there?
lock and load, Chuck.
Sarah, hang on. This chat...
I mean, are we talking about, like, like a chit-chat?
or... FDR fireside chat?
no, everything is fine. I just thought that a night in might be nice.
a night in. At the Buy More.
well, there's nothing I love more than... a night.
together. With you.
gentlemen.
back off of him!
Yeah, nice quiet evening.
at least it can't get any worse.
well, well, Jennie Burton.
my old high school punching bag.
love your dungeon. Can't wait to catch up.
game LAUNCH
guys, we've got 40 minutes to the game launch.
time to move some units, boys, all right?
now, in the meantime, please do me a favor: Fix this.
you know, shower, shave, toothpaste, hair gel.
anything, okay, just... try not to embarrass me.
huh. You talk like you got a lot of brass in your pants.
What...? For a dead man.
he's here. - Who's here?
the man whose job you stole: Big Mike.
move. - All right.
I knew this day would come.
I specifically avoided my mother's house so I didn't have to see him.
but I can handle this.
I can handle anything. Right? I am Cobra.
son, I'm bursting.
with pride, seeing you in that suit.
I never wanted anyone else to wear it.
but if it's family, it's okay by me.
so, Mr. Panzer.
you on a new diet? New workout... regimen?
cause you're looking pretty fit.
can I just... - Nope.
just one thing. - Not interested.
Oh, you're acting awful bitchy, Burton.
or whatever it is you go by.
Sarah Walker.
and don't forget it.
all set.
you done with that newspaper?
look who thinks he can read.
Sudoku fan, huh?
go ahead.
well, enjoy your new accommodations.
there's no room in my heart for anger.
love, though? I'm full up!
I spent the past few months out on the sea, hunted with my bow, looking for my - my inner Big Mike, my happiness.
I discovered the source of it.
good. - Your momma.
and I want to do right by her.
I want to make her...an honest woman.
let's stop talking.
all right? It was good seeing you.
I'm really glad you came by, actually, and, you know, we'll...
what is that?
that's a full half-caret pear-cut cubic zirconium.
I came by here to ask your permission to marry.
think on it.
give it back to me when you think I'm worthy of your mother's love.
keep it on your person if you could.
I don't trust the scoundrels working the store.
nor should you.
but on that note, actually, I should probably get back to work...
you and me both.
know what I mean?
I intend to support your momma as best I can.
but man-to-man, I'm between gigs.
hear there's a game launch.
you can always use an extra hand there, am I right?
especially when it's a close relative asking?
Yeah, I'd... it's...
I won't let you down, son.
Ah! Boss.
hey- ey. All right.
Grimes. Manager. Speak.
what?
what do you mean, we're only getting six copies of "Spy Attack"?
I got 300 customers waiting for this game.
Yes, I'll hold.
so, chat time?
sure.
here? - Yeah, okay.
look, it's not a big deal.
I mean, well, it is... maybe.
Wh-What, it is a big deal, Sarah? What is?
I love you, Chuck, that's the first thing.
I love being with you.
ditto. Right back at ya.
it's just, um... Can we, please, just for a second...
did you just flash?
Heather Chandler is in the Intersect 2. 0.
she was connected to Frost.
I think she knows my mom.
I have to talk to her now, because the transport will be here soon.
Chuck, unless you want Beckman to know that we're looking for your mom, we don't have the authority to interrogate Chandler.
well, we don't have the authority to use the supply closet for what it is we use it for, but we do it anyway, don't we? Look, she knows my mom.
okay, fine. But you can't just start whipping questions out to somebody like Heather Chandler.
it's, it's just not gonna work.
this needs to be a real interrogation.
good cop, bad cop.
how about tough cop, silent cop?
Okey-okey, which one am I?
right, right, got it.
Oh, hey, uh, real quick though:
time machine.
in case things go south, use "time machine" in a sentence.
that'll be code to back off and regroup.
okay. Just remember: Tough cop. Silent cop.
of course.
we need information on an arms deal you were involved in, with Alexei Volkoff and an agent whose code name is Frost.
and coming my way is...?
optimal placement at Yucca Mountain, and favorable parole review.
how about a unicorn, too?
I'm as likely to get that as the crap you just offered up.
you know, sarcasm is the lowest form of...
sorry. - You want to offer me something?
witness protection.
for that, I'll spew on Volkoff and Frosty the Snow Bitch.
but we both know that's handled by WitSec, who I'd be happy to talk with.
not some wispy man-boy and a bottle blond with a daddy complex.
you- you got a lot of nerve talking to her like that.
Burton can handle a little ribbing from an old pal.
you're her partner, Chuck, not her boyfriend.
wait.
you two are actually together?
Uh-us? We? No.
we're not, no. - Oh, get out!
you kids are an item! He's not just your partner.
isn't spy sex great?
Heather, we were discussing your - So. How deep are you? Shacking up?
doing the dog thing first, or straight to babies?
one?
five?
time machine. - Time machine? Really?
right. Okay...
when I said use it in a sentence,
I was thinking more along the lines of, "You want to relive your past, honey?" Then get a time machine.
you know, we really need to take this slow.
Absolutely. Look, I'm sorry I lost it in there,
if you let her get under your skin, about the living together thing, and about the other thing that she mentioned-we're not gonna get anywhere.
the other-other thing? What is that other thing?
remember: Tough. Silent.
do not let her get under your skin.
she's, she's not. She won't - what? Hey.
okay.
food, Panzer.
we can contact WitSec...
so when did you two start dating for reals?
but first we need a good faith offering.
you know why she won't talk about this, Chuck.
because it makes her edgy. I get it.
you met my so-called husband/con victim, right?
I toyed with normal life.
played happy homemaker for a while.
and as soon as he got serious, I robbed him blind.
my advice? Pull the ripcord before you get fried.
the only thing getting pulled is a rope.
Hey, look at my time machine! We have an appointment.
I'm gonna handle this.
I can handle multiple stressors at once.
angry mob? Of course.
lifetime of calling Big Mike...
dad?
I really do not like that woman.
Yeah. Yeah, that's clear.
what's not is why this topic of you and me is such a hot button.
what's going on?
uh, Chuck, we have a problem.
we do? Is that what you wanted to chat about?
cause I thought we were en fuego? - No, we have a serious problem.
if he's trying to escape, why doesn't he just run?
this might be about me. I kicked his ass on an airplane once.
Hey, Chandler.
Mr. Volkoff says hello.
you send her out now, and no one else dies.
don't open that door.
Heather? What is going on? What is this about Volkoff?
this morning, I got a transfer to Yucca Mountain, out of the blue.
I get in the transport, and that monster's in the other cage.
Volkoff engineered the transfer?
he's capable of it.
wh-why would he want to? What did you do?
nothing. He's being petty.
I blew a half-a-billion-dollar deal.
the F-22 plans were for him.
I guess he's mad.
come on, Casey. Pick up.
come on, Casey. Real fast, you just inform the...
anxious horde that the game distributor made a slight error and there's going to be a delay in delivery time.
you know, two weeks.
sounds like a job for the manager.
no games.
Casey. - Casey, a prisoner has escaped in Castle, - and we're trapped in cell six. - On my way.
Colonel, I know I'm supposed to be upstairs, but Doc Bollywood was staring down my shirt and those losers in line are just freaking me out.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just get to the cell block...
Greta! Greta, what's happening?
she's indisposed.
uh, uh. Guys, guys, uh, Panzer's on the computer right now, but I can't see what he's doing.
buying patio umbrellas.
he's trying to get to us, you dope.
boy, you're a charmer.
perimeter LOCKDOWN
Walker, you're going to have to override the Castle lockdown.
can't get in. - I didn't put the system into lockdown.
I just locked the door to cell six.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Panzer locked us in?
this is not good, people, okay?
I've been locked in enclosed spaces with this guy before.
I handled it fine, but he got very edgy.
he's using the mainframe to open each cell door.
there's a fire override. I'm going to have to access it.
hold on.
come on, come on.
door two's open.
Hello, Colonel Casey. Welcome to the new Castle override mainframe.
how can I help you today?
you got to be kidding me. - I'm sorry. Could you repeat that?
and door three.
location of fire emergency override.
did you say "hire nursery overhige"?
why would I say "overhige"? It's not even a real word.
I'm sorry. I didn't get that.
door five.
fire emergency override. Where is it? Or you die.
the fire emergency override is behind my monitor.
just press control, escape...
thank you, Casey.
okay, ladies, let's go. Move out.
you go first. Scare the rats.
no, you go first so I can keep an eye on you.
Sarah. You. Me. Go now. Come on.
dude, we're totally screwed.
no. No. This is a positive.
okay? Today, we get to be challenged.
so I'm going to make a phone call and I'm going to get us the games that we were promised.
now, you will handle the launch presentation.
at midnight, we will settle the crowd.
you will read from the script.
and you'll read from the script slowly.
you don't just drop a role in a man's lap, and say,"Go, seal, clap for your fish.
I must make this my own if I am to undertake it.
whatever.
this is no big deal. I can handle this.
I can handle multiple stressors.
what monkey flung this? No.
you know, I was thinking about how some of my favorite movies wind up in air ducts.
like Aliens and Die Hard.
although, generally speaking, it doesn't wind up well for the duct crawlers.
thanks for that, movie dork.
I bet you have, like, a Tron poster in your room.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Keep crawling, sister.
Walker, where are you? - We're just passing coupling duct 5A.
come on, come on, come on, come on.
in ten feet, turn left, straight on into the junction room.
heading there to unlock it now. - Any sign of Panzer?
not at Castle. But he's after you. So watch your back.
that's fantastic. You hear that, Chuck?
stay alert, as in, don't distract yourself, staring at my tail.
looking at your- no, no. Thank you, no. - I'm kidding.
Jenny-Sarah, how did you end up with such a goofball?
masculine goofball, thank you very much.
Oh, you're sweet. I did the sweet guy thing, too.
I know how it ends.
sorry. Foot slipped.
Ooh-ooh, touchy.
must be hitting home. Of course I am.
Sarah, We're almost at the junction.
game launch
attack
nice and orderly. You are in for the night of your lives.
don't get your hopes up. There's not enough games.
Hey, hey. Don't say that. Everything's fine, everybody. Everything is great.
go get your - Listen to me. Stretch it out.
stretch it out just a bit longer for me, guys, cause we are almost out of the woods.
easy, sister. We've got this covered. - Okay.
we've got this covered. - All right.
what do we hear? Oh, yes.
Jerry. What's going on, my man? What did you score me?
how many you got? What do you got? How many games?
Yeah. Yeah. Two? Two games.
that's- I- That's not enough, Jerry. I got to have more games, brother.
Hello? Jerry? Jerry? Come on.
son, your crowd is surly. And you got no product.
I don't want to tell you how to do your business, - but the sheep need a shepherd. - Yeah.
they sure do. Sheep, huh? Sweet little sheep?
running your mouth is not going to get you witness protection.
what do you mean, payback?
I got hitched to a dork, just like you - sweet, dumb, loyal, a mutt - and that was attractive.
I thought, "This schmuck is going to make me a better person."
and for ten minutes, I convinced myself I didn't mind movie night or dinner at 6: 00.
but then my true nature kicked in.
and the reason this conversation has Burton so upset is because it's doing the same for her.
we're the same. - Not going to dignify this.
right, yeah. Because we are professionals.
and we cannot hear a word that you are saying. - She's all spy.
white weddings, rug rats in a minivan? It's not in our wiring.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Heather, guess what?
you talk too much. - Burton? Be kind to him.
he's too sick in love to see the truth.
just remember, she keeps secrets for a living.
tell me, why are we saving your life again?
because of my connection with Frost.
and my time with her in Burma.
I'm right, and she can't face it.
that's why she's upset. - She's not upset, Heather. Okay?
I know what she looks like when she's upset, and it's more like - Look out!
No!
no, no, no. Not the tie. Not the tie.
Sarah, help me! - Chuck!
Sarah, help me!
Chuck! Come on.
that felt good.
you know, they wanted me to read you this trash.
but you deserve better.
we, as a people, deserve better.
and a kung fu demonstration of moves in the game Spy Attack.
can we just buy the dumb game?
no, you cannot!
how far down did he go?
could you see the bottom of the duct? - It was too dark.
and I was kind of concentrating on his fists flying at me.
this morning, I was going to Monte Carlo.
but instead, I spent the night as a canned good.
it's funny the way that life can suck.
move and you die, tunnel rat.
all right, got him.
transport on the roof in two minutes.
frost last chance to deal.
you're just a dog with a bone. No dice.
good luck. I'm rooting for you.
but I'm certainly not betting on you. - Shut it, convict.
you're not letting Heather get to you, are you?
no, of course not. I'm all good.
I know your "all goods" and that was not a real "all good."
it was a fake "all good." I'm just curious why what she said got under your skin like that.
well, once we get rid of these guys, we will have our chat.
what are you smiling at?
this doesn't smell right.
they're not CIA. They're Volkoff's men.
down, down, down, down!
Volkoff must have intercepted our transport.
Chuck, we'll handle the gunfight. You go after the prisoner.
you go for the exit. I got you covered.
I'm all right.
your man's wounded, pinned down.
give us Chandler and you both live.
hand me over. Save your ass.
we both know what you're gonna do, so just do it.
you kept me alive for information, but it's not worth dying over.
I know you, Walker.
I know what you're going to do.
you don't know who I am or what I want or the thoughts in my head.
we have nothing in common.
on the count of three, two, one.
that was my last bullet.
the flea-ridden masses infest my house.
do I cry, perchance to die? No, McFly!
this game launch will not be televised.
enough, man, just give us the game! We want the game!
we want the game! We want the game!
we want the game! We want the game!
we want the game! We want the game!
we want the game! - Guys!
we want the game! - Guys!
the games didn't show.
so shut up and let the poetry slam you. - Thank you.
freeze, Panzer. - Look awful shaky with that pea shooter, boy.
how's your aim in tight quarters? - Perfect.
cause that's the gas line. You hit that instead of me, this whole building goes.
so it is. But that doesn't matter, because you're trapped.
Yeah, I don't think these air ducts were meant to hold 400 pounds, and since most of that is you, I need you to back up now.
you're losing them, son. They're going to rampage.
Hey! Hey, hey, don't!
Halt! Halt! Halt!
everybody just - whoa.
Oh, no. Oh, no!
back up.
you back up. - You back up.
the engagement ring!
look, this is a call to arms.
I brought my black case for just such an occasion.
it's in my car. Go get it for me.
I don't work for you. I do work for you.
repaired - Get on your feet, son. - I can't.
I can't. The-the-the - There's a riot going on. - Right, right.
but your engagement ring - it fell out of my pocket.
I've looked everywhere. I can't find it.
I screwed up, okay? I need your help.
you find the ring, I'll take care of the riot. - Yes, sir.
excuse me, fools. I said excuse me, fools!
that's not fair.
what is this madness?
Yes, we promised something we couldn't deliver.
Yes, had we delivered, you would have been overcharged.
is that any reason to behave like this?
you got to ditch your lives and spend a full week with your dorky friends talking video games, which no sane person would have ever done with you.
and because we came up a little short on supply, there's a riot?
hell no!
this ain't no video game. - It's not.
this is real life. - The truth of life.
this violence ends now! - Not later.
Peacefully! - With peace.
quietly! - With a whisper.
all civil like. - Like a civilian.
move it. Get out of my way. - Excuse me, son.
you'd best stop - or I will come down there and make an example of you.
try and stop me, fat man. - What? Who's this ?
give me the Disco Stick. That boy is family, and my name is Mike.
big Mike.
Mr. Big Mike.
all right? - Well done.
another Purple Heart, Casey. - I'm fine.
gonna be laid up for a while.
paid vacation. - Yeah.
I can't stand the silence.
well, maybe you could use the time to meet up with Alex.
figure out what your role is in her life.
you should do the same for Bartowski.
so we can get back to normal around here, hmm?
whatever that means.
operation Beacon. That's where I met Frost.
what's Beacon?
it was supposed to be an underground arms pipeline, but I lit out before it was active.
frost was always around Volkoff.
doing what exactly? What does that mean?
I couldn't get the full gist of their relationship.
but she was there.
maybe she had to be.
that's all I know.
Hugo's ready to roll.
let's go.
thank you.
maybe you're right - maybe we aren't alike at all.
maybe you are capable of love, affection and vulnerability.
I hope so.
Chuck seems like a really nice guy.
and he's really in love.
are you?
good-bye, Heather.
I looked everywhere, Big Mike. I couldn't find your ring.
but I did find this.
don't give me this because you think I'm upset.
the assistant manager's vest is a sacred vestment.
no, I know. Believe me.
but you're the best. You can handle anything.
and I would be proud to have you as assistant manager.
although I understand if you couldn't quite forgive me yet.
I just want you to know that I'm really sorry about the ring.
marriage isn't about a ring.
it's a lifelong commitment of compassion and understanding.
especially for your spouse's idiot relations.
all is forgiven.
here. This is yours.
and for what it's worth, you have my permission to...marry my mom.
son.
so Beacon - it's a...it's a place to start.
the other night when you repeated what Awesome said about us being next having kids - it scared me. - Okay.
and I wanted to tell you earlier, but, um, I didn't, and I've been thinking about it all day long.
and Heather kept poking the topic with a needle.
you're nothing like her.
for a long time, I was exactly like her.
and it took me a night in the guts of the building to realize that I'm not anymore.
at all. And I don't want to be.
but I-I do need to take things slow.
I'm not ready for parenthood either.
one day, hopefully, but not now, not yet anyway.
who are we kidding? I'm barely on solid food myself, so...
okay so, slow.
super slow. Really slow.
let's start small.
you tell me ready or not ready. - Okay.
we're on a trip. One of us forgets our toothbrush.
do we share? - I am ready to share your toothbrush.
Oh, oh, using the bathroom.
door open or shut? - Door shut. Always.
preferably with the sink running or the radio on. - Yes.
Hi, i'm Chuck. Here's a few things that you might need to know.
I'm not gonna fight you on this anymore, Chuck.
if you trust her, then, that's gonna be enough for me.
your father never wanted you to see this. - See what?
flash! Come on!
Sarah, my mom did something to me with that device.
your mom gave us a wut.
Sarah, I can't flash. The Intersect is gone.
we're in a real mess, Agent Bartowski.
your trust in Agent Frost proved a colossal error.
I know I screwed up, General, and if she weren't my mom,
I would have shown much better judgment.
which is why you haven't been ejected from the Agency.
but Agent Frost is extremely dangerous.
she and Alexei Volkoff are now top priorities for capture.
agent Walker, Interpol reported a sighting of them in Istanbul.
move out immediately.
what about me, General?
until the Intersect is working, you're Chuck's shadow. In Burbank.
um, so, General, I'm sorry, but are you saying that the Intersect can, in fact, be fixed?
our scientists think your mother used a suppression device to disarm the Intersect, for which there could be countermeasures.
so it's only been suppressed ? it's not gone, like gone gone??
I'm not a scientist, Chuck, but you're about to meet a lot. You can ask them.
this is pretty snug, isn't it?
the Intersect is an implanted collection of memories.
a suppression device hides those memories under what you might call a...
psychological rock.
we need to find that rock and remove it. - Here we go.
week 1
week 2
week 3
Ooh! What was the point of the water? I'm just wondering.
week 4
all right. And that's... day 31.
great session, fellas.
the file you requested, Mr. Bartowski.
Thanks, Greta.
is it strange that all of the new employees have been named Greta?
strange? What's strange about it?
doesn't seem strange to me at all.
who cares as long as they're spicy?
well, that's-that's strange that you don't find that strange, but speaking of strange, you've been giving off some real sad sack vibes lately, Charles.
bit of a whiny wuss, if you ask me.
do you ever wonder if this is all life is gonna be?
you know, Buy More? Burbank?
are the best years behind us? - Whoa. Whoa.
that sounds like candor. - Yeah, no Yes. No. Yeah, no.
I mean, I can handle candor. I'm an emotional man. But candor from you? No-ski.
Bartowski, no interest. And you knew that.
I must be worse off than I thought. - I don't know why.
my life would be a never-ending Cialis commercial if I had her.
Hey. - Hey.
you look gorgeous. How was, uh...
russia this time? I wish I had good news.
there's no sign of your mom or Volkoff anywhere.
what about his headquarters? - Boarded up.
for the last month, every single trail has gone cold.
they're underground. Any luck with the...
tests? You'd have heard.
and by that, I mean you'd have heard my giant sigh of relief, even in Moscow.
you'll get it back soon enough.
when? What's the timeline?
I'm hoping very soon. - 'Cause I haven't been on a mission in a month.
I wake up with my trigger finger twitching.
it's itchy. Literally, it itches.
right. Um, look, all the scientists who were checking me out - they hit a wall, but they're sending a specialist in from Langley. He should be here any minute.
he'd better be good.
Casey, nobody wants to put the team back together and back on missions more than me.
you got to know that. - Hmm.
he's not being fair. - Hey.
don't let anybody pressure you.
Hey, hey, no pressure, buddy, but, uh, Casey is a disaster.
Morgan. - No, I'm serious. I'm worried about the guy, okay?
I was talking to Alex. Apparently, he went over there to help her move some furniture, and he just stood there, staring at her fish tank for an hour, muttering something about an itchy trigger finger.
buddy, I need the Intersect back. I get it. - He gets it.
okay. - Look, the specialist is probably here right now, so, wish me luck.
really, really, really good luck.
Hello?
stop! Oh!
amazing work, Agent Carmichael!
you have the stones of a bull!
Thanks. And who might you be?
agent Rye. Jim.
CIA psy-ops division, Langley.
forgive the dramatic introduction, but I need to know what kind of man I was working with.
and you, taking on three ninjas without the Intersect?
impressive.
Thanks. You're, uh...
you're different than the other scientists.
well, I don't believe that the psychological rock can be hoisted off the Intersect by watching kittens play with yarn. - Hmm.
my method is physical, psychological, painful...
brutal. - Brutal?
can't wait to get started.
Chuck, if you're serious about restoring the Intersect, then I promise you, at the end of this process, you will be a spy again.
now, what do you say? Are you with me?
let's get physical.
visualize for me the rock sitting on the Intersect.
done It's, uh, granite, I guess.
Ooh, with little specks of marble in it. You know, that kind of shine...
talk to me about size. Is it large, small?
Largey small. I don't know. It's... Oh!
what was that for? - We're starting with pain therapy.
that was the required dose to lift a small psychological rock.
great. Great. Got it. Small psychological rock.
okay, good. Got it. Oh! Why?
that was the shock for medium. I need to know what I'm dealing with here.
Oh. So if he tells you it's a boulder, are you going to hit him with a tank?
Sarah, I'm okay. I have to do this.
we are digging deep into my mind right now. - It looks like he's hitting you.
agent Walker, how long has it been since you've done Kenpo Karate?
not since spy candidate school.
Naihanchi One! Naihanchi Two! Bear Kata!
old man Kata!
well executed.
you smell delightfully of grapefruit.
now, once we determine the proper method of treatment, be it fear, pain, anxiety, his will happen with the Intersect.
like her memory of Kenpo, we just have to find the right stimulus to reactivate.
agent Walker, no more interruptions.
Yes. Thank you for coming in today. Next time, buy something.
that's all I'm...
dude. Dude, listen to me.
that new Greta just disappeared into thin air.
I've seen her do that before. - Mm-hmm.
I thought it was just in my head. - No.
she also has a tail.
Yeah, that is in your head, but this disappearing - isn't that highly suspicious?
I'll answer for you. Yes, beautiful Lester, it is.
follow moi.
black Forest Ham on honey oat with chipotle sauce, banana peppers and jalapenos? See?
no Buy More employee is that sophisticated.
Mama...mia.
God, you got beaten to a pulp. - Yeah, well, neuroscience hurts.
you know, I don't know about Agent Rye's method. He seems a little unorthodox.
well, yes. Granted. No question about that.
but, you know, he's doing his best, and I am willing to endure a little pain if it means getting the Intersect back.
Chuck, your physical and mental health are important, too.
Ah. Ah. Ah. Why are my earlobes sore?
okay, I-I think I know how to fix this. - Oh. Hmm.
Oh, yeah. I should get beat up more often.
Chuck, this, um, treatment, the experiments...
promise me you're not doing it for me, or us. - No. No. I'm doing it for the team.
no. I-I just...
you know, I've never been a spy without the Intersect, and I quite like being a spy.
doing great things. Doing them with you. Doing them with you. I want that back.
you don't need the Intersect to do great things. You're great on your own.
but am I a spy?
Yes. Yes. But you're Chuck Bartowski.
and you do that all on your own.
the massage oil should be warm. I'll be right back.
I think we should start with some top half.
honey! We have company!
what happened? Did you flash?
what the... What the hell is going on?
what the hell is going on?
did you flash? Yes or no? - What are you doing in our bedroom?
Chuck, since our pain experiments failed at Castle - your fault, not mine - I think the key to restarting the Intersect is fear.
what are you doing in our home? - Castle's a safety zone.
apparently, this place is, too.
Chuck feels protected by you. We need to up the ante again.
PFOD. - PF... Pfod?
pure fear of death.
we need uncut, pure adrenalized fear rocketing through your plasma right now.
this was close. But, hey, that could be the cure.
holy - oh. Oh, you scared me half to death.
two civilian employees have been watching me.
I'm getting annoyed by this.
I have a way of dealing with annoying things. It's pleasant.
but only for me. - Oh, I see.
and, uh, can you tell me which two civilians might, uh... might that be?
why'd I even bother?
of course. I will keep an eye on them. Okay.
go home. Go home.
you go home! - Get out of here. - This way.
general, Chuck can't go on a mission without the Intersect. That's insane.
as well as being an expert psy-ops operative and Neurological PhD,
agent Rye is a fully trained field operative.
if he thinks the Intersect will be restored by taking Chuck on a mission, that's where he's going.
and a mission just hit our radar, Agent Rye.
I think it fits your bill.
is it dangerous? - Incredibly.
chance of violence? - It's guaranteed.
great! - This is not great. This is crazy!
agent Walker, this is what Chuck wants. Right, Chuck?
whatever it takes to get the Intersect back, General.
Chuck and Agent Rye will be going to a chalet in Gstaad, Switzerland, for the auction of a 100-carat diamond, the "Cane Volto.
our intelligence indicates that leaders of numerous criminal and terrorist organizations plan to attend the auction.
this stone is more than it seems.
method for money laundering, payment for illegal weapons, that sort of thing.
Yeah, we've done this before. - Thanks. - Whoa.
Chuck, your job is to win the auction and bring the stone back to the U. S.
a room full of underworld killers. Sounds great, right?
general, I assume that Casey and I will be there as a backup?
no. No. With them in Gstaad, Chuck will never reach maximum fear.
Walker, you and Casey will monitor the mission from Castle. - What?
Chuck is going alone with Agent Rye?
Sarah, the only way I'll be able to flash is if there's no safety net.
Yes, Chuck, but then there's no safety net.
we got a plane to catch. Let's move out.
wish me luck? - Chuck, don't.
don't be a hero.
just come home safe to me, okay?
quite a tableau.
sometimes... scenery makes me cry.
isn't it amazing being a spy?
I wish Sarah was here.
not in, uh, an official capacity, of course.
the only way in or out of the chalet is the gondola.
things go south, we're trapped.
you'll produce enough adrenalized fear to lift a car, let alone restart the Intersect.
he's a big boy, Walker.
Yeah, Chuck's never been on a mission without the Intersect.
tell me, honestly, if things go wrong, do you think that he can handle himself?
I don't know. But I know he'll try.
which is exactly what worries me. I'm just gonna check in again.
for the sixth time.
Chuck, are you there yet? - Yeah, we're here.
Sarah, Switzerland is amazing. I mean, other than the fact that this place is populated with a crowd of international psychopaths, the air is so fresh and the chocolate?
so milky.
uh, Chuck, listen, listen. If you get cornered and you still can't flash, just don't do anything crazy.
don't worry. Everything's going to be just fine. I'll talk to you soon, okay?
Hey, are you sure I don't need a disguise? - Hmm.
someone could recognize you as CIA.
come after you with a knife. That would be great!
huh.
the seller . Adelbert De Smet.
better known as "The Belgian." - Huh.
I bet I know how he likes his waffles.
Belgian! Yes! Yes! I love your humor. So disarming.
de Smet is known for industrial espionage, not precious gems.
which is another reason this auction seems odd.
aside from the crowd.
we've got underworld players from Russia, Serbia, Montenegro.
Wow. You really know your Euro baddies, don't you? - Focus, Chuck.
when you win the bidding, your competition's not going to be happy.
if you're lucky, they'll follow you and try and kill you.
fingers crossed. - Good luck.
wait, wait. You're... You're-you're going? I'm alone on this?
it's your best chance to flash. - Okay.
the Cane Volto diamond.
very rare, 100 carats, D - colored, internally flawless.
bidding starts at 25 million Swiss francs.
do I see 30 million? 30 million.
do I see 40? 40.
do I see 50? Sir, you're already the high bidder.
do I see... 50?
60? Sixty million Swiss francs?
bid again, get bullet in back. - Holding at 50, then.
50 million going once.
okay, you know what? Nice try, Rye. But I'm not falling for it.
going twice. - 60 million Swiss francs.
60 million. - I'm not afraid of your phony Russian accent or your finger-gun, okay?
bid again and die. - Do I hear 65?
Ooh, let's get crazy. 80 million Swiss francs.
80 million to bidder number three. - Oh, look at that. I didn't die. What a shocker.
do I hear 85? - Look, stop fooling around, okay? We got a job to do.
do not bid.
80 then, going once. - 100 million Swiss francs.
100 million, ladies and gentlemen. Going once.
twice. Sold.
you can go.
I blew it. - You absolutely blew it.
and no flash, huh?
have you had this chocolate? - Yes. It's so milky.
it's so good.
I thought that Russian would get your blood pumping.
I honestly thought it was you. The Russian?
it was such a horrible accent. It sounded so phony.
what kind of a spy am I? I cant' even be scared properly.
but-but listen. I- I had a thought.
who carries 100 million Swiss francs on them? Nobody, right?
so that means the diamond is going to be here until the money's transferred to The Belgian.
until then, we can at least get a better look at the thing.
you're good, Chuck. Genius minds think alike.
but I say we do more than just look at it.
let's steal it.
you all know this new Greta.
she's beautiful, yes. And efficient, sure.
but why all the suspicious behavior?
we are forming a fact-finding mob, and we want you, my friends, involved. We are calling it...
operation Get a Greta.
the main objective is to root out why such a nefarious individual is working here at the Buy More.
Oh, crap. They're on to Greta.
what do we do? - We tell Greta. She'll handle it.
right, right, right. She'll... Wait a minute. What do you mean, she'll handle it?
okay? Hey! Hey! Hey! Who-who is she?
assassin.
wait, no, she'll chop 'em up into a bunch of little pieces.
are you kidding me? I mean, these are our... sort of friends.
colleagues? - Mm.
no, huh? Doesn't matter. No assassins, okay?
you and I, we have to handle this. - We don't have to do anything.
you're on your own. - Come on, I thought we were a team, you and I- a damn good one.
the team is DOA without the Intersect working.
so why protect something that's going up in smoke, hm?
you want to waste time with these idiots, you're on your own.
Hey, Chuck. Hold on a second.
do you happen to have the time?
that was amazing. Where'd you learn how to do that?
star Trek.
star Trek, really?
no, not really. Bangladesh. Meditative trancing.
the secret is mind over matter.
but I love the show. - Well, who doesn't?
there's nothing in here.
all right, well, what are we supposed to do now?
now you flash.
how can I flash? I don't exactly fear death.
security measures will activate in four...
three... two... one. - Security measures?
I've heard of this kind of thing!
the temp drops about 150 degrees in 30 seconds!
so unless you want to become a Chucksicle, I suggest you flash!
it's not happening! - Concentrate!
feel the fear lifting the rock! - No flash, no flash.
maybe Sarah can help us! Yeah, Sarah can help us!
I got no service. What are we gonna do? My-my-my-my teeth are freezing.
Chuck, can you flash? - It's not happening.
how about now? - N- N-N-N-N-Nothing.
how about now?
all right, move out of the way.
I honestly thought you would flash.
you knew the combination this whole time?
we have a mission to complete. I came prepared.
but I honestly wasn't prepared for this.
there's more than one diamond. What's going on?
this has got to be worth billions of dollars.
well, they can't just be diamonds. On all my missions, it's never just been diamonds.
Yeah, you're right. They're working some angle.
Yeah, well...
when I heard the mission was diamond-related,
I took the liberty of grabbing a loop out of the Castle's supply closet.
Plus, I took an online gemology class on the flight over here - it was very convenient.
just like I thought - fake.
it's made out of glass, but there's something embedded inside.
a microdot.
replace it with our phony.
this is a fake, too.
great work, Bartowski.
now we got to figure out what the story is on these phony diamonds.
rye, I don't understand.
I don't know what the problem is. A minute ago, I was truly fearing for my life.
why isn't this working?
we need to explore a more sophisticated level of fear therapy.
the psychological rock has keyed on to a deeper anxiety.
a person...
a relationship. - With whom?
huh? What did...
you... With her.
well, this has been... a quiet lunch.
uh, I should let you get back to your books. - And you back to work.
how is that going, by the way?
what have you heard? - Just what Morgan's told me.
that he's about ready to have an intervention on you.
look, we both know you haven't been on a mission in a while, but I think there's a little more to this than just an itchy trigger finger.
what gives?
I'm preparing myself psychologically...
in case I get sent back to Afghanistan or Iraq.
mm, I got soft. I made friends here.
well, you know Morgan's scared of the team being broken up, too, and...
if you are transferred, which might not even happen, don't you think it'd be better to be nice to your friends drive them away?
that's just a thought.
Hey, fellas.
Hey. What are you doing? You all right? - Yeah.
can you tell me what this is? - Not a lure for the new Greta.
okay, do me a favor, you need to back off this Greta thing, okay, for your own good.
the operation is underway, Grimes, you can't stop this pit bull.
he's got a taste for meat.
you want to know who's gonna be meat? You guys.
you don't scare us. - Yeah.
we won't be stopped, and we can't be stopped, and we won't be stopped.
I think I see her.
Hi, now! Wow.
sorry, you have to stop doing that, because I have a bad ticker.
this is absolutely the last straw.
they put a webcam in my locker, they bugged my price gun, the psychotic one follows me with a video camera narrating the tracking and hunt of the Greta marmot.
what does that even mean?
which one do you think is the psychotic one? Doesn't matter? Never mind.
if they discover my identity, it'll breach national security, and a CIA facility would be at risk.
it's time to neutralize the risk.
whoa, hold on, hold on a second, please, please. They don't know anything, okay?
trust me, they have the mental capacity of field mice.
they bother me again, they meet my favorite friend.
understood.
I'm magnifying the microdot.
God only knows what's on it, but it can't be good.
we'll start the analysis and send it back to the team at Castle.
do you really think that Sarah is the emotional rock sitting on the Intersect?
why do you always call for her right before you flash?
you did it in the bedroom and in the vault.
Yeah, well, you know, I was... - Scared.
perfectly normal... for a nerd herder.
but a spy, Chuck, handles his fear on his own. - Or her own.
ask yourself a question. Are you a spy...
or are you a guy with a spy girlfriend?
I'm a spy.
the microdot is heavily encrypted, but it appears to contain a series of photographs and blueprints for CIA assets.
the Belgian's selling our intel to the highest bidder.
and there are 20 other fake diamonds just like it.
Colonel Casey, Agent Walker, finish decoding the intel.
Bartowski and Rye, capture The Belgian and recover the fake stones.
until we know what's really on those microdots, this is code red and could likely get very ugly.
general, at this point I feel it's essential that I go with Chuck and Agent Rye to Switzerland.
um, I think Sarah should let us handle this, seeing as how we've determined this is the only way I will get the Intersect back working.
Chuck, we're talking about real danger now. - I'm sorry, and I can only handle fake danger?
look, I-I know the Intersect is important, but so far none of Agent Rye's therapies have worked, and the microdot contains highly sensitive information that the wrong people will kill for.
well, I can take care of these wrong people without you holding my hand.
why does it make sense to risk your life?
because it's what I do- I'm a spy. - No, Chuck, you're not.
not right now.
the mission is best accomplished with the proper manpower.
agent Walker, get to Gstaad.
a supersonic jet will have me there in there in five hours. We'll talk then, okay?
I'm sorry, Chuck. I just can't let you risk your own life.
Greta to the cage, please. Greta, to the cage.
a delicious, though complicated foot-long Subway- Black Forest Ham on honey oat with chipotle sauce...
no, no, no, no. Guys, please, what are you doing?
banana peppers and jalapenos... - If she doesn't kill you, I will.
has been found with your name on it.
so come to the cage.
now we wait.
Oh, I see our little lure worked, eh, Greta?
if that is your name. Come, sit.
what the hell are you doing, moron?
listen to me.
we can do this the hard way, or we can do this...
the way that's...
very difficult.
whoa, whoa, stop, guys. Greta, guys - quit this now.
no. You know what? I've had it. This stops here and now!
now who are you, Greta? And what do you know?
okay, there it is. There it is.
we are prepared for the knife eventuality. Jeffrey, please disarm her.
whoa, mama!
the only question is: Do you want to die with your wig on or off?
are you talking about my hair? - All right, wait, wait, now, hold on.
whatever you're thinking about doing, do not do it . okay?
it is not worth it. - Stand down! Now!
stand down.
what is going on here?
her locker was full of credit card slips, and she was making off with the head massagers.
she's been sneaking around because she's a thief.
swine! How could you do that to me after I trusted you?
let's go. Let's go. Come on. Thank you. Oh, well done. Thank you. - Mm-hmm.
okay, you're going downtown.
thief? How does a thief disappear into thin air?
well, there's an old walkway behind the walls in the HTR for electrical repairs.
should have been boarded up after the fire, but she found it.
why did she transmogrify into a woodland creature? - Shh.
why does she have a tail?
consider that ignored. You fellas did a great job. Buy More thanks you.
that was intense. We caught a thief! - And...
I need a change of trousers.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Chuck. I think we got a visitor. Yup.
the Belgian just entered the vault.
there's no microdot!
well, uh, evidently, we, uh, had a security breach.
get surveillance footage of the vault and the hallway and meet me at the gondola.
but the Russian buyer? - No time for that. Pack up the diamonds. We're leaving now!
gondola. Perfect. Enclosed space. No escape.
we'll arrest them there.
uh, Sarah's plane's almost here.
well, we can wait for her and lose him, or...
go be heroes.
let's be heroes. Attaboy!
Hey, it's Chuck. You know what to do.
Hey, it's me again. Why aren't you getting my calls? Call me, okay? I love you.
Colonel Casey, I've admired your work for years, but this outpost and its personnel are unprofessional.
and I'm disappointed in you.
listen, Agent Greta, I don't know who you've worked with before, or what crew you were on.
this is the best damn spy team in the world. We are strong.
so do us a favor. Don't let the door hit you in the ass.
we are strong, aren't we? - Mm.
Yeah, even if we are missing a-a few pieces.
and see, doesn't it feel better being part of a team, than always suffering alone?
right. I always forget the no-touch thing . point taken.
Oh, man. Speaking of missing pieces.
Casey, why is Chuck on that monitor?
this isn't good.
Hey. Chuck's on the microdot.
Belgian knows he's the Intersect. - What?
come on, Chuck, pick up the phone.
Hey. Chuck.
Hey, Sarah. - Are you okay? Where are you?
we're on the gondola about to arrest The Belgian.
if anything happens, I know I'll flash.
Chuck, listen, The Belgian knows exactly... - Agent Walker, we can handle it from here.
No! Wait!
all right, follow my lead.
and if we get into real trouble, you'll get us out of it.
you don't need Sarah. This is all you.
last chance, Chuck. On or off?
on.
Adelbert De Smet, you're coming with us.
no, no. No, Agent Carmichael's coming with me.
the asset in your head is worth far more than the entire list embedded in these microchips.
surrender... or die.
they know I'm the Intersect. - Scared?
me, too.
drop your weapon! No tether, no Sarah.
we're in it up to our chins.
how you feeling, Chuck? - Not great, not great.
honestly, I sort of flashed, but I'm not sure. - All right, well...
let's find out!
200 feet to the rocks below!
talk about some serious danger, huh, Chuck? Hold on a second.
anything? - No.
no, nothing yet, and believe me, I'm plenty terrified! Help me up!
sorry, Chuck, not gonna happen. - What? What? No.
my hands are slipping. Rye, my hands are slipping. I may actually die right now!
fantastic! This is your final test. The wind's picking up.
you're looking death right in the face.
the only thing that can save you now is the Intersect.
focus, Chuck. You can do this!
no. This is crazy. It's not coming back.
but you know the rock is Sarah.
tell yourself you don't need her, and give in to the fear!
but I do need her!
I love her, and I'd rather love Sarah than have the Intersect. Now help me up!
CIA didn't send me out here to affirm your love, Bartowski.
you need the Intersect up and running.
now, get that rock off your chest and be a real spy like me!
did I just get... shot?
no. No! - I certainly did.
No!
grab my hand or die!
come on!
Chuck, what's going on? Where are you?
pursue Agent Carmichael, and we will kill him. Slowly.
there will be no further warning. - No! Please wait!
general, I want immediate authorization to mobilize to Belgium and hunt down this son of a bitch.
they were at Gstaad Airport.
I have a witness who saw them board a private jet, tail number CLM...
CLM-one-two-one-one. I know, Agent Walker.
okay, the plane didn't just disappear. It had to have landed somewhere.
we put a code red out to every clandestine agency on the planet.
the moment there's a sign of Chuck, we'll mobilize every resource.
Colonel Casey, you've got your mission. You're running point.
and me? - Sarah... he's out there. We'll find him.
but until there's intel, go home and get some rest.
you'll be informed of any developments.
I'm staying right here. - You're going home. That's an order.
Bartowski's smart. Intersect or no, he'll be fine.
this is all my fault.
he did this to prove to me that he could be a spy.
what do you want? - I want the Intersect.
what are you doing, Walker?
I'm gonna go find Chuck. - We'll go together.
wherever he is, we will find him, and we'll bring him back.
thank you.
I don't... I don't have it, Mr. Belgian... De Smet.
it's gone. I lost it.
please Agent Carmichael, don't take me for a fool.
the less you resist, the less painful this will be.
hi i 'am things that you might need to know.
I'm going undercover into Volkoff Industries. I'm gonna take them down from the inside.
hydra is the heart of Volkoff Industries, but it has a flaw.
so you just destroyed the whole system?
of course not. I just downloaded all the data to a more secure backup location.
all I want you to do is kill John Casey.
throw me out the window.
there's a little platform down the.
give this to Chuck.
Hey, what'd he say?
John's in good hands. His doctor's a friend of mine.
he thinks that he'll regain consciousness in a day or two.
thank you.
Casey's family; Chuck and I do anything for family.
thanks for coming by, El.
of course.
Thanks.
Hey, he is the strongest man I've ever met, okay?
he'll pull through.
you guys hear that?
I think I did.
I don't know, did I?
that's a grunt, that is a Casey grunt.
I think he's trying to say something.
what do you got? Go ahead.
pants.
pants, pants, he said,"pants.
pants?
why pants?
the man's never going to wear pants again.
no, he means his pants. Maybe there's something in 'em.
that's-- yeah, of course.
Yeah, good observation.
Yep, got it, here it is. It's a, uh, like, half an eye.
that's half an eyeball.
what is he doing with that?
Casey, where did you get this, where did you get this eye?
What'd he say?
he said,"Sarah.
Volkoff's security is down. We have exactly two minutes.
let's hope this tells us where he downloaded the Hydra Network to.
you should answer it.
frost, it's me.
Yes, I know, I can see you.
it's really dark there. Where are you?
I'm just getting ready to go to bed.
okay, first ask me how my day was.
how was your day?
awful.
Andre wasn't working out in Budapest, so I had to let him go...
off a 20-story building.
20 seconds.
Oh, that's just awful.
well, I really should be going.
all right.
sweet dreams, my sweet little pea.
good night, darling.
did you find its location?
looks like Volkoff is entrusting the Hydra to another person after all-- the Contessa.
we've received a message from Agent Walker.
seems she'll be in the field a while longer.
she's learned that Volkoff is planning to transfer the Hydra Network to a woman called the Contessa.
general, what about the piece of Hydra that I flashed on?
Roni Eimacher designed Yuri's eye.
there's a good chance he designed something for the Contessa, too.
general, there's got to be another way, okay?
Sarah pushed Casey out a window, for crying out loud.
this needs to end now, she needs to come home.
as I said before, my superiors will follow up on Eimache and the rest of the information in the Hydra fragment.
I'm sorry, but you're too close to this, Agent Bartowski.
okay, fine, well, then what am I supposed to do?
you wait.
that's all you can do.
o - Okay, hey, it's gonna be all right, buddy.
you know what? We'll go outside, we'll get some fresh air, play a little bocce.
no.
no, Morgan, I can't do this anymore.
I watched my mom leave us and my dad follow her.
Ellie's right.
Bartowskis take care of their family, and right now it's time I put mine back together again.
this was my father's mission, and I have to finish it. We're gonna take down Volkoff.
we? Really?
I'm, I'm in, though.
I mean, which guns do we grab?
no guns.
we need...
office supplies?
no, Morgan, we need a plan.
this is gonna work.
Yeah, it is.
of course it is; it's a good plan.
Thanks.
you know, I've been doing a lot of yoga lately, so I feel like I'm peaking mentally and physically, so no problems there.
you think this is what they call a, uh, suicide mission?
what?
no, of course not.
look, the first step is we find the guy who designed Hydra: Roni Eimacher.
and Morgan, this is going to work.
I promise.
of course.
Oh, man, we're going to need some help.
get someone up here immediately.
we've got a problem with the...
my God.
he's still alive.
we have a problem in the form of Stephen Bartowski.
Orion was killed by The Ring.
well, then somehow a dead man broke into my computer system last night.
he wants something very dear to me.
I'm gonna take Frost to a safer place.
I want you to figure out where Orion has been hiding all these years.
where can I find you?
I'll be visiting an old friend-- the Contessa.
thanks for meeting me here. I appreciate that. Hold on one second.
there you are.
and boom.
push mix for Ellie. Just what the doctor ordered.
but Rusted Root is rad, right?
Yeah, yeah. They're rad-radical. Awesome. Good.
happy to help.
plan is in place.
no deep terror can eat away at me from the inside now.
deep terror"?
did I say,"deep terror"?
you said,"deep terror.
listen, I got to run.
I still got to find someone to make Ellie's placenta into vitamin pills.
one more thing really quick.
protection?
just in case.
but promise me, if anything out of the ordinary comes up,
well, thanks for everything, Chuck.
pardon me, Jeff.
I bet you Bartowski put a bunch of indie crap on this-this push mix.
it's like, we get it, dude, you're cool.
you know. Has he no respect for the unborn.
the first sounds that a child hears should not be from an audio disc.
what is the matter with these people?
Yeah, they should be raw, unfiltered, live.
this baby needs a performance, delivery room style.
this baby needs...
so i Eimacher through his online Settlers of Catan league.
turns out, he is a engineering professor at UC Irvine.
that's great, great.
this will be easy. I've done a thousand missions like ...
but wait a minute ...
told us to back off.
I actually don't think we need Castle.
Oh, my God, where am I?
is this a bathroom?
no.
this is hell.
listen, you're gonna tell us who the Contessa is.
the Contessa?
I have no idea who you're talking about.
do not play games with us, Roni Eimacher.
my name's Barry Greenfield.
Oops.
if you'll excuse us for just a moment, Mr. Greenfield.
that is not Roni Eimacher!
I know it's not Roni Eimacher! But you got to admit, looks a lot like him.
well, it's...
okay. All right. Fine, fine, fine.
what are we gonna do?
gonna tranq him, then we'll just put him back where we found him.
perfect. No, wait a minute. He's seen half of our faces.
Chuck, does that mean we have to, uh...you know...
are you crazy?
we just have to find the real Eimacher, all right?
and this time, bring the picture!
please don't hurt me, I'm just an engineer...
wait.
am I in a bathroom? What?
no. Geez. No. It-it's hell.
it's clearly hell.
we went through all this trouble-- it's hell! All right?
we know you designed the glass eye that Alexei Volkoff stored his Hydra Network on.
you two are in serious trouble.
Volkoff kidnapped me and forced me to create the Hydra Device.
he said he'd kill everyone I know, if I didn't do it.
so you've never met the Contessa?
the Contessa?
no, that's where he took me to-to design the Hydra.
what does that mean?
the Contessa's not a person.
it's a...
welcome to The Contessa.
what do you think?
beautiful.
well, um...bought the old girl years ago, on craigslist Dubai.
she's got anti-aircraft missiles, sonar stealth technology, and an old-fashioned ice cream parlor.
I like to think of her as my floating fortress of fun.
captain!
welcome. Good to see you.
the Hydra Network must be on the ship somewhere.
this is our chance.
Yes. But Volkoff brought us here because he's nervous about something.
wants to stay mobile.
we have to go for the Hydra tonight.
and nothing can get in our way.
let's do this.
I told you to take the flippers off!
we're in.
all right, listen...We gotta get down to the lower decks, okay?
that's where Eimacher said the server was.
Hey, hey. What's going on, buddy? We gotta go.
you never told me you were gonna be wearing something else underneath that wetsuit.
Morgan, are you telling me you're not wearing any clothes under there?
underwear, Chuck. I'm wearing underwear. I mean...
it doesn't matter, doesn't matter.
you know what? I'm cool like this.
I look like a seal...a seal that does yoga.
yoga seal. - Yoga seal.
all right, just... - Just don't squeak.
copy.
we're as close as we're ever going to get.
tonight, whether or not we find the Hydra, you're going home.
what do you mean?
no, I can't. I promised Chuck that I wouldn't come home without you.
Yes. I made a lot of promises, too.
I don't want you to become me.
and I will not allow my son to become his father.
so, tonight, it ends.
whatever system Orion used to contact you is untraceable.
I need to figure out if he's working with someone on the inside.
I told you to find Orion.
I'm well aware of his connections inside my organization.
then let me prove Frost's loyalty's only to you.
give me access to Hydra.
hold on.
do it.
it's not on this deck.
what the...Chuck? - Sarah!
what are you two doing here? - Taking down Volkoff.
how did you even find us?
you shouldn't be here!
she's right. This is my mission, and it's too dangerous.
no. No, no. This is our mission, okay?
I never should have let you go; either one of you.
you don't have to do this alone. We're here to help.
seriously, guys, it's going to be okay.
Chuck has a plan.
the server room is right down there.
mom. Mom! Mom.
when we get back, we need to have a serious talk about the benefits of tranq guns.
there's the door to the server room. I'll try to hack in.
hang on a second. This dude's got a key card, right?
maybe this will help us with the way in.
uh, Morgan, we don't know what's going to happen if you do that.
see? Easy.
wait. This can't be right.
guys!
Morgan! What's happening?
lasers. Lots and lots of lasers. And-and they cut things!
hang on, buddy! Hang on, buddy. I'm in the system.
awesome, Chuck! Nice work! You got the door to the server room open!
now, just turn off the lasers!
I don't think I can do it from here.
if you can get into the server room, you can power them down and open the door for us.
are you crazy? He can't go through all those lasers!
you kidding me? I can't go through those lasers!
this could be the only chance you have.
we have to hurry.
Yes, you can.
yes you can. Morgan-- I...I can do this!
cause I'm...a yogi. All right? I am peaking mentally...and physically.
I just need to use my Ujjayi breath, okay?
come on.
warrior Two pose.
transition...
slowly...
into Warrior Three pose.
easy...
I didn't know I could do that.
guys! I'm stuck!
okay. Okay, okay, buddy. I'm gonna try something else.
easy...
easy.
your strength is in your core.
Oh, God! Oh! Not good!
lasers are moving, now!
no, no, worse now! Worse now! Oh God! It's slicing through my wetsuit!
Morgan? Are you okay?
Morgan, don't you ever do that again.
it's all right. It's okay.
you're not cold? - Yeah.
here.
I'm glad you're okay.
thank you.
Thanks. And thank you for this.
although I don't think it's going to...
fit over these shoulders; my lats have been, uh...
it's, you know...It's just-just kind of, barely.
careful, Chuck. Don't touch that.
okay.
I'm in.
all of Volkoff's contacts are here.
I am transferring Hydra to a CIA offshore server...
now.
Hey, babe! Watch me glide.
Devon! My water just broke.
but you're not due yet. What is Baby Clara thinking?
well, it happened about ten minutes ago.
I took a shower, and had a protein bar, and now I'm ready to go, so...
let's go have a baby.
okay.
I'm prepared for this.
Yes, you are. You have a plan. You have an awesome plan.
okay, everything's gonna be just fine.
Where's my push mix?
I just got it from Chuck. It couldn't have disappeared.
Devon! It's fine, really. I don't need a push mix. Let's just go.
I'm going to grab some water for the road.
I'm not ready for this. Perfect plan not perfect.
Oh, God! It's gone! No push mix: no baby. It's all gone!
are you expecting someone?
Mrs. Woodcomb?
your transport service has arrived.
let's move quickly. - Devon, did you arrange this?
voice identification required.
damn it. Only Volkoff can access this.
it's connected to his voice.
okay, Chuck, you and Morgan need to get out of here right now.
no. You all need to get out of here.
Volkoff will be here any second. - No, not without you.
Hey, we're all going, okay? Let's go.
frost, I am very disappointed in you.
death is the solution to all problems.
that's a quote from my favorite poet and humanitarian...
joseph Stalin. Good job I didn't tell you all my secrets, isn't it?
just know...
you did this.
shoot them. - All right, then shoot 'em, but not before I get one shot off, and one is all I need.
get out of here, Chuck.
Morgan, go. Go! Now!
come on, Sarah.
come on, come on, come on. Mom, come on!
you do realize for them to get out of here alive, - you have to stay. - Yes, I know.
run! - Mom!
Chuck, come on! - Mom!
are you okay? - Yeah.
look, we better get out of here. - No, no, this wasn't part of my plan.
come on, we have to go.
you have nothing to say to me?
no perfect excuses?
no "Trust me, Alexei"?
no. - Nothing?!
give me the gun.
no one touches my Frost.
come, please.
you need to see this.
I have something I've got to show you.
please, you have to see this.
meet me at Twin Pines cabin. Godspeed, my love
what is this?
you tell me.
armand found it on our server a few moments ago.
I've never seen this before. - Really?
because this message led Armand to hundreds more.
you've been talking to Orion every day for years.
night after night, behind my back!
that's why you didn't want me near you.
I have no idea what you are talking about.
stop lying to me!
you knew your husband was alive.
you knew the whole damn time.
I believed in you.
you want the truth, Alexei?
the truth is, my husband, alive or dead, will always be ten times the man you are.
and every moment that I was with you,
I was thinking of him.
I'm going to visit your husband, and when I come back...
I'll bring you his body.
moron Grimes.
you're here.
of course, I am.
I, uh...I brought your bonsai.
thought it might feel more like home.
would have brought your guns, but don't think they really would have let me through the door with those, so...
no, save your strength, Dad.
the doctor says you need to rest.
listen, I,uh...
I... kind of like having my dad around.
I don't just like it; I've gotten to used to it, so...
I've spent most of my life thinking that my dad was dead, and...
I'm not ready to do it again, okay?
my contractions are only ten minutes apart.
let's go ahead and administer the pitocin, please.
can I get ten cc's of Compazine?
I'm a little nauseous. - Of course, Dr. Woodcomb.
is your husband all right?
Yeah. He'll snap out of it.
he was like this once before, during his exit exams.
he'll be fine, I'm sure.
this is the location Orion listed on his communique.
then let's finally put this ghost in the ground.
I'll do this myself.
stay here and keep guard.
we finally meet.
Charles. - Hello, Alexei.
I believe you were looking for me.
morning, sunshine. L.
Oh, you seem very proud.
using your father's toys to lure me in.
I'm not dead yet, so you must want something.
you're right, actually.
there is still something I want.
I hadn't figured you as the vengeful type.
is it because I spoke disparagingly about your father?
this is because you took my mother from him.
you took his whole life, and his death...
his death was ages ago. Isn't it time you moved on?
bearing grudges.
a bit childish, isn't it?
you can't kill me.
for the same reason your mother and your girlfriend couldn't.
what do you think's gonna happen to all those people you love if you put a bullet between my eyes?
I have access to everyone.
I have to admit, it was a good plan.
using my own jealousy against me.
but it had its problems.
how could it not?
after all, you are your father's son.
just know this.
if it wasn't for you, everyone could have gotten out of this alive.
and now for the sister.
I told my men to kill your mother, if they didn't hear from me.
and they won't. So...
Cheers, Charles.
here's to a family reunion.
I can't believe you haven't figured out the solution yet.
solution?
to what?
gotcha.
death is the solution to all problems.
got it, Chuck. We got the pass code.
what is this?
death is the solution to all problems.
that fake communique you received from Orion
that was also a virus that my father created.
and now that I have your pass code, that virus will begin to transfer the entire Hydra Network onto this computer.
technically, I guess you could say that in the end, it was Stephen J. Bartowski who took you down.
fitting. Don't you think?
you know, my father...he taught me a lot of things.
like, looks can be deceiving.
fight for your family.
something's wrong.
Mary, quick!
and of course, never use a gun...
...unless you absolutely have to.
Yeah, I probably should have told you, I have this...
thing about bullets.
I was never going to kill you, Alexei.
after all, I am my father's son, aren't I?
you made one mistake, Charles.
all the information you've got is right here in your father's little cabin in the woods.
and outside that door,
I have dozens of heavily-armed men.
if I don't walk out of here, they're gonna come in for me.
you're gonna need an army to get out of here alive.
will they suffice?
arrest him.
I just received word from Frost and Walker.
they're en route to Burbank.
it was a good plan, Agent Bartowski.
thank you, General.
tell your mom to come visit.
it's been fun.
excuse me, guys. No, you first.
as you were. At ease... gentlemen.
we have to get out of here right now.
what's up, buddy? Is everything okay?
just got a call from the hospital.
Ellie's having her baby now. - What?
uh, General, General, can we borrow a van?
agent Bartowski, you just arrested Alexei Volkoff and obtained the Hydra Network we have spent the last 20 years searching for.
lieutenant, get this man a chopper.
Thanks.
you're dilated to ten and fully effaced, Dr. Woodcomb.
the contractions are two minutes apart. The baby's coming.
can you get the doctor?
babe?
honey, look at me.
I need you to go outside and take five minutes for yourself, pull yourself together and then come back to me, okay?
you're all I have right now, Devon.
I need you.
EW, pregnant women.
Ooh, pregnant women.
excuse me, candy striper?
Hi. Listen, could you point us in the direction of the Woodcomb womb?
what? - Without us, that kid is gonna grow up listening to Snow Patrol and... Coldplay.
and we just can't have that, can we? So...
I'm sorry, but no one goes in there unless they're a family member.
so I suggest that you take a seat.
Dr. Adler, Room 315, please.
Hey, Awesome?
heard Ellie's in labor.
where is she?
why aren't you in there?
Oh, listen, don't make the same mistake I did.
I missed my daughter's birth, missed her whole damn childhood.
Alex's mom had to raise her all on her own.
there's not a day that goes by I don't regret that.
now you get in there. Move it.
it's time to push. - Okay.
Jeffster!
it's over.
No! No! We did what we came here to do, Jeffrey.
cover song by cover song, we are shaping the youth of America. Aah!
I'm not allowed to do that anymore.
are you family? - Yes.
okay. Well, only one of you can come in.
mom, go ahead, please.
just make sure she knows we're all out here, okay?
I will.
you came.
we all did.
- I got it.
Where'd Alex go? She went home.
no, I didn't.
I just went to get a coffee.
whether you like it or not,
dad, I am not going anywhere.
neither am I.
good luck trying to get rid of me, guys,'cause...
I like you guys.
your, your line is "I like you, too, Morgan.
Ellie, she's so beautiful.
Congratulations.
awesome.
hello... Diane.
Hello, Roan.
what's the deal with this Roan guy?
he's a legend in the department. An incredible spy.
real old-school James Bond type.
Congratulations.
awesome.
Hello, angel.
marrakesh, MOROCCO
I really wish you'd pick up.
I need to hear your voice tonight.
I'm sorry, again, that I couldn't make it, but...
I'm thinking of you.
sweet dreams, and besos, my flower.
I'm jealous. - Would you like a drink?
I'd like to be that drink.
men must take one look at you and tell you all their secrets.
impress me.
here's one...
the new hundred dollar bill.
impossible to counterfeit, but... Someone did perfectly.
it's called a super note, and I'm in town to find out who made it.
so you're a spy. That's very exciting...
Hello, Roan. - Naughty...naughty...
what a way to go.
Ellie, I think she has your mouth...
I'm out of here. - Okay.
here's the sit-rep.
it has been 23 minutes since Clara had a number one, 51 minutes since number two, and 76 minutes since her last feeding.
maybe she's hungry. - Or maybe she needs a change.
Hey, Sarah, could you get the diapers and wipes?
Chuck, feeding pillow, stat! - Okay.
mom, can you take her for a minute - while I get settled? - Yeah.
that's my girl.
grandma's got the magic touch.
smooth and silent.
same technique I always used for moving live explosives.
okay, I'll just edit that part out.
babies are stressful.
tell me about it. You know, speaking of which Alex... you know, there's something I want to tell you... talk to you about...
hold on!
it's all good...great. Alex isn't pregnant.
no, no. She just... She wants me to meet her mom.
Kathleen. - Yeah. Kathleen.
you know, and the thing is, I feel kind of uncomfortable starting off this relationship with her with this secret about my friend-slash- not-dead-ex-fiance.
could you touch base with her, please, - and tell her you're actually alive? - Not a good idea.
you know, Alex's having a tough time with this, you know?
she's been lying to her mom this whole time, and, she couldn't even talk to her when you were in a coma.
you see? So...
I'll think about it. - Yes! Thank you. Great! Perfect.
you're the man!
could you do it kind of quick, though, you know?
because I just... I had this dinner planned on Friday...
so, Chuck, Sarah, what are you guys thinking for the big day?
it would be so great if Clara could walk down the aisle as your flower girl.
you know, Woodcombs usually walk at six or seven months, so you really don't have to wait that long.
what are your colors going to be?
I'm a better gray than blue, just as a...
I still have my veil, if you want to borrow it.
I don't... I don't know that Sarah's a veil girl.
my cousin is the raddest vegan caterer.
you got to use him. - Honey, the wedding cake he made Jim was beige.
well, you know what they say: something old, something new, something borrowed, something beige.
wrong. It's not beige...family...intense...
I'm actually sweating.
the last time I sweat, there was gunfire involved.
I hear you.
we need a bad guy.
so badly.
guys...
we need a mission.
sorry to disturb you, General.
No...not at all.
general, we were just wondering if there was anything that you, or our country, needed, from us.
preferably far outside of America.
actually, I do have a mission, but it would be off the books.
you would have no support, and it's extremely dangerous.
we're in! - In!
then your mission is to rescue and return one of our own:
agent Roan Montgomery.
roan Montgomery? You mean the seduction - master himself?
I love that guy.
what happened? Was he captured?
he was last seen in a caf in Marrakech.
general, given Agent Montgomery's proclivities, is it possible that - he perhaps took an elective trip off the... - No.
that is not what happened.
we believe he was investigating local crime czarina Fatima Tazi.
she is best known for her private merc army of female soldiers.
agent Montgomery, luckily, has a tracker on him.
it shows that he is in Fatima's fortress in Marrakech.
locate him, and bring him safely back to the United States.
thank you.
what is going on with the general? She's a hot mess!
well, General Beckman and Roan Montgomery have a bit of a history.
their romance has been going on for decades.
historic events happen when those two are together.
Berlin' 89, Iraq' 91... Florida 2000...
which is why we better go get him.
did you ever think your storied life as a spy would come to an end because you picked up a girl in a bar?
well, actually, yes.
that's precisely how I thought I'd go.
but that's not what happened.
no, I'm exactly where I wanted to be: in front of the woman who's created the world's only flawless counterfeit bills.
and meeting me was worth dying for?
you're not going to kill me.
you're going to make me your head of distribution.
no, no, no. I'm not joking.
my international contacts can help you launder your money so that people like me don't keep showing up at your door.
and why would I do business with a CIA pig?
because rolling around in the mud can be so much... fun.
what?
you always over-pack for missions.
how am I supposed to know what kind of mission we're going on?
it could be a shooting mission; it could be a dancing mission.
it could be a shoot-dance, which I know isn't really a thing, but knowing our track record, is very much a possibility.
well, let's just save that for the honeymoon, shall we?
so...
your family. - Sorry, sorry.
they're a little intense about the wedding?
they're very sweet.
but... - But...
I have a proposition for you. - Okay.
what if we eloped?
I know that you want the big family wedding, but your family is going to be this intense until we get married, so...what if we- just the two of us- were to run away to some beautiful, romantic, amazing place?
then all of this stress and pressure could be avoided.
think about it.
is she trying to kill me? - I know.
elope? I can't elope.
of course you can't! Who's going to be the best man?
I'll tell you who.
some weird, creepy cousin of some weird, old stranger you find to marry you.
and then his weird, old wife who smells like Thousand Island dressing is going to stand up for Sarah.
and then you're stuck with a bunch of weird, old, stinky strangers in your wedding photos.
I just got my family back together, you know?
I have a niece now.
I want them to be in my wedding.
but you know, marriage is about compromise, and this is what Sarah wants.
but you giving Sarah what she wants and me not getting what I want is not, necessarily compromise.
the point is-- and I'm sorry to say this to you, buddy, because I know you've never been able to do this with a lady, ever
but you're going to have to put your foot down.
just say no.
no? To Sarah?
this is what I think you should do, okay?
you start by saying no to something far less important, and then, you know, slowly work your way up.
a practice "no. " - Practice "no."
interesting.
okay.
cut through and enter here.
Chuck, do you need some water?
you know what?
no.
okay.
actually, yes. I'm kind of thirsty.
OK.
let's go.
do you want pliers?
Yeah.
some fortress.
well, looks like we need a costume change.
making me, once again, right to, as you say,"over-pack."
by the way, for the record, I will not at any point during this mission be dressing as a belly dancer.
what if you need to do it for our country?
I'm sure America can handle it.
by the way, if you're into the Moroccan thing, we could always elope here.
just think about it. - Come on. Let's go. In here.
again, Casey, I can't apologize enough for that accidental touching in there.
just very a tight changing space.
don't mention it.
looks like Roan is upstairs. - Let's go.
super bad Saudi oil tycoon at 12: 00.
what do you think they're doing here?
it's not our mission.
let's find Montgomery and figure out what's up. Come on.
well, according to the tracker,
roan is in that room, over there.
after you, Casey. - Okay.
this could get fun.
finally, my little minx.
did you bring the oils?
shall we celebrate the little soiree I made for you downstairs?
wait, wait, wait. I hear the footsteps of two women.
and a large man.
darling, you know I like it spicy, but I do think...
don't you mean "two large men" ?
you three? What are you doing here?
rescuing you. You're welcome.
I don't need... rescuing.
unlike you, Colonel Shoot 'Em Up,
I can finesse my way out of any situation.
and what situation would this be, exactly?
listen, I don't have time to go into it, but I'm about to blow Fatima's counterfeiting ring wide open.
wait, you're on a mission? - Yes.
she's making super notes. Wait a minute.
how'd you find... Who sent you?
general Beckman. - Gen...
Diane's birthday present.
the watch. It's got a tracking device in it?
well, you've got to leave.
she's going to be here any second. - We're going to seal our partnership.
look, look. She's coming. She's coming.
you've got to hide.
just hide.
go, go. Here, go! - Hide!
how is my naughty little turncoat?
ready to be your naughty little turn-on.
you are very feisty?
feed me or beat me. I don't care.
just get in here.
Hey. - Hi.
so, everything's set up for Friday.
you're going to meet my mom.
are you excited? - What?
I am so excited. Absolutely. You kidding me?
it's just that I have a little surprise for you, as well.
Really? - Yeah. I talked to your father.
and he agreed to get in touch with your mom.
let her know that he's okay, alive and well, and back in the picture.
isn't that great?
come on. - What?
Morgan, no. No, that is not great at all.
I have been keeping my dad a secret from my mom on purpose, okay?
to protect her, because for the first time in her life she's finally happy.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, bad initiative.
I thought it would have made you happy.
okay, I'm sorry. I'll fix this, okay? I promise.
you look a lot like your father right now.
a cigar right now and a knife, and you would...
you've been a very naughty, naughty little spy.
you better teach me a a lesson, then. - Yes, I will.
Chuck, if you get us caught because you sneeze, we are officially the worst spies in the world.
I know. Bad Three Stooges.
I get it. And I, and I...and I won't.
but man, it is dusty.
we have to get out of here.
let's just take Fatima out.
we'll grab Roan and bail out the window.
okay, copy that. You good, Chuck?
no.
no? - Yeah, no.
I- I said no because I think...
I think Roan is making some good headway here and we should let him finish.
the mission. Finish the mission.
but... - But nothing, okay? I said no...
woman.
sometimes in a relationship people disagree about things and...
see, see? Not the worst spies in the world.
guards!
betrayer! - No, not betrayer, lover.
shut up! These are clearly your comrades.
take them all to the dungeon.
baby...
this is all a misunderstanding. It's me, Roan.
sit tight. I'll get you out.
so, last I saw you two you were a young, exciting couple-- chasing, flirting.
now, the silent treatment.
sexy.
if you must know, we are very much in love, happy, and soon to be married. We're just...
having a bit of a disagreement right now, and the ball and chain isn't helping.
are you calling me a ball and chain?
there's a ball and ch...
there's an actual ball and chain here.
do you...Do you not see this on the ground attached to my leg? Ball and chain.
Yes, thank you.
what's with all the "no's" lately, anyway?
I may have been a little obstinate before.
okay, let me guess. This is about something bigger.
performance issues. - No! I am adequate.
more than adequate in that depart... Right?
you can't, you can't agree with me?
I don't want to... Sarah, I don't want to elope.
okay? I just don't.
not at all. Not even in the slightest bit.
I've always wanted a big family wedding, and now more than ever, so no.
my answer to eloping is no.
okay, fine. I hear what you're saying.
but why do you get to say no?
what about what I want?
okay, I've got eyeballs on the dungeon door, and there is a lady guard.
I'm gonna seduce my way past her.
no.
what? What's happening?
Casey's gonna try and seduce the guard.
No! What?
the man who flunked my course at the farm twice?!
Casey, that's not a very good idea.
don't you have a gun or some explosives?
Yeah, because you're terrible at seduction.
you have no finesse!
I heard that.
blowing the door will only alert the other guards.
now, this is exactly the type of girl I know how to charm.
God, he's gonna charm her.
look, tranq and explode!
Casey, tranq and explode!
evening. - Stop!
that's a lovely weapon you have there.
go.
gosh, it must get awfully lonely down here in the dungeon by yourself, no one to talk to.
Yes. Yes, it does.
cold, too.
you can take it.
you're hearty.
I can see why they didn't assign one of those skinny ones down here.
don't tell me.
so you tranqed her and blew the door.
how charming.
I rescued you. Shut up.
okay, let's get out of here. - I'm staying here.
what? Why?
I told Beckman about Montgomery's leads.
I'm gonna get to the bottom of these super notes.
get him back to Burbank.
Yes, about that, I'm not going back to the States with you.
Thanks, all the same. This has been a debacle.
no, Roan, we need to take you back with us.
no, thank you...
really.
Beckman said he might try that.
tell Morgan I'll be back in a week or two. See ya.
okay, well, mission accomplished.
Sarah and I will go upstairs and let you guys catch up.
sit... down!
sitting down, ma'am.
agent Montgomery, your mission to Morocco, who ordered you to go?
well... - No one did!
Fatima Tazi, the super notes?
you went after them without any authorization, and now I have one of my best agents hidden inside a Moroccan fortress without backup!
be on standby.
if Colonel Casey gets into trouble in Morocco,
I am sending you in to get him out.
general... if there's trouble, I'll get Casey out.
no. You're done, Roan.
I have a new mission for you.
Charles, you should never sneak up on a spy.
even a former one.
right. Sorry.
so, how's, how's everything going?
I've never felt polyester against my skin before.
I feel a chafing.
the chafe of stylelessness. - I hear you on that.
listen, Roan, I'm-I'm kind of going through my own spy relationship turmoil thing, situation here, and I was just-- I wanted to ask you about the general.
is this about the Morocco thing? - Of course not.
Diane is upset about Berlin.
Berlin? - Chuck, sit down.
I have a few minutes left on my break.
Berlin. 1989.
not a good year for building walls in East Germany.
we had just won the Cold War.
I was off to Moscow on an assignment.
Diane was on her way back to Washington and a promotion.
we wouldn't see each other for months, and just before I left, she asked the question.
what about us?
that's when I said it.
I'm not even sure why, but I told her," If we're alive in 20 years, let's throw in the towel, be a normal couple, lead a normal life."
Beckman was a dirty blonde?
it was the '80s. Everything was dirty blonde.
we were supposed to meet in Washington a few days ago.
I really wish you'd pick up.
I need to hear your voice tonight.
I'm sorry again that I couldn't make it, but I'm thinking of you.
sweet dreams, and besos, my flower.
Casey. Yes! Listen.
listen, I'm so glad I caught you. This will not take long.
Morgan, I'm on a mission. - Yeah, I know. I know.
I'm in a wall.
of course you are. Hear me out, please.
I know, I know. Talk to Kathleen. I will.
actually, you know what? Never mind about that.
it's-it's totally cool. Thank you so much, though.
you were right. I'm going to do it.
no, I wasn't totally right, you know.
as it turns out, Alex doesn't want you to talk to her.
but, enjoy your wall.
and come back safe. So, wait.
she doesn't ever want me to talk to her mom?
I don't know, buddy. I don't know.
and, for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry.
in fact, if you need someone to talk to,
I'm here. I mean...
got to go. - Dig deep in there and...Casey?
I never thought I'd make it 20 years.
I am a spy. I can't be normal.
it's not who I am.
see, that's how I feel about the eloping thing.
that's not who I am.
well, then, you know, you have to stop saying no to Sarah and convince her.
the first thing I teach my students at the farm is when you want to convince an intimate relation, you have to set the scene for the conversation.
create an erotic atmosphere.
like a sexy situation.
Yes, but don't say it like that.
everything is easier with sex in the air.
secrets are shared.
yes's come more easily. No's disappear.
I just...I just...I don't...I don't think I know how to do that.
Charles, come here.
let's try on some shirts.
now, you're going to need a suit.
I'll be right out.
all right, well, listen.
I made us a reservation at this place, so just throw on a little something? And...
Hi, Chuck.
I'm sorry.
that's an excellent apology. I am very sorry, too.
now, I want you to relax, and just think of the two of us running away together.
yeah?
now just imagine, instead of me wearing a white wedding dress in L. A. with all the family, picture me wearing this just for you anywhere in the world.
sound like fun?
Yeah.
Chuck, elope with me.
Yeah.
no. Wait.
no. No, no, no. What are you doing?
I can't believe you're doing this. - What?
you're using Roan's methods.
sexy situations? Erotic atmospheres?
you're trying to seduce me.
why are you wearing that outfit?
well, I'm trying to seduce you, too.
just not, clearly, as well.
Beckman wants to see us in Castle.
well, maybe we should change, then. - Fine. Fine.
I'm not saying I want to change.
I want... I want you to stay in red...
always, always be in whatever you're wearing right now.
all right, here's the situation.
Fatima's meeting with her financial backers on the other side of this wall.
Fatima, we provided you with $100 million in gold five months ago.
you won't tell us where your mint is, or where you're storing these bills.
level with us.
these super notes really exist?
it gives me great pleasure to announce that we have been able to produce more notes than originally anticipated, for a grand total of one trillion dollars.
what are we going to do with one trillion dollars?
that is too much currency.
our fortunes depend on a strong dollar.
yours may, but mine does not.
thanks for the gold.
what happened?
Casey? Casey, are you there?
Casey. Thank God. Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm still hidden, but part of the bearing wall came down.
I'm trapped. I may have to cut my arm off.
hold on that, Colonel Casey.
stand by for further instructions.
you're going to Morocco.
we need the location of that mint so we can destroy it.
Yeah, and even more than that, we've got to get to Casey before he chops his own arm off.
general, how are we going to find the location of the mint?
Fatima isn't going to tell us anything.
only one man could possibly get the information out of her.
roan? Ma'am, Fatima will have Roan shot on sight.
no man could seduce Fatima Tazi twice.
it's a... - Seduction impossible.
get him.
general, I know that Roan has broken a promise or two, but you can't send the man to his own death.
get me Roan Montgomery!
and that is the story of Sleeping Beauty.
you know, Grandma once had to take a potion that made me sleep for a couple of days.
but Grandma's partner had a potion, too.
and when it was time to wake me up, he put the antidote on his lips and woke me with a kiss, just like the prince.
grandma was on a mission.
can you say "mission"?
we'll get Casey.
once we have the location of the mint, our attack drones will take it out. Move out.
one last thing.
in case I don't see you two crazy kids again, do one thing for me.
remember you're in love. Listen to each other.
never go on a mission angry.
please, don't call out for help.
I had to come back to you, my love.
what are you doing here?
just hear me out, please. I'm not here as a spy.
I'm here because of you. I never wanted to leave you.
I was extracted because of another woman.
another woman?
who?
my general. - Who is impatient.
get the location of the mint, Roan.
all this interpersonal stuff on a mission?
it's very unprofessional. - I know!
I don't want to fight. - Me, neither.
okay, well, look, we know my family's stressful, but what else?
what, you know, other pros and cons of having a big wedding?
well, okay, I mean, who am I gonna invite?
who's gonna come?
who's gonna walk me down the aisle?
I'm such an idiot.
this was never about my family.
this is about yours. I'm so sorry.
I should have figured that out.
I should have told you and not had you figure it out.
you have got to be kidding me with this conversation.
I am about to cut my arm off.
Casey, hey. Yes. Good. Sorry. We're right here.
darling, I know you're not after wealth.
your heart is far too pure for that.
what is it you want?
why don't you tell me?
let me help you.
they strip-mined over my entire world.
Yes, you told me about your village. It's called Setouan. Is that right?
Yes. You listened. - Of course.
I'd love to visit it someday.
I've got the village on my monitor.
there's the mint. We got it!
this is Beckman, authorization 8485-Charlie.
initiate air strike, sending grid coordinates now.
air strike... - Chuck, Sarah, get Casey out of there.
we just need a minute.
general, we're gonna be slightly delayed.
Chuck, what's happening?
bad guys. Lots of bad guys.
right behind you.
take one step to the left.
the other left, idiot.
never done this before.
what? Never done what before?
there are Americans in the palace.
you... bastard!
Yes, I answer to that. - What do we do?
kill them.
well, that takes care of your friends.
Casey, you are great!
get me out of here!
right. Right.
now to deal with you, Roan.
so sorry.
so rude.
Hi. Could I call you right back?
I'm right...
who is this? - This is General Diane Beckman.
with whom am I speaking?
this is the woman who is about to kill your agent.
good. It's about time.
good?
she said, "Good."
we're in the middle of a tiff.
I don't want to stop you.
I'd just like to say one last thing to Roan.
I'm happy to see him die.
another one of your admirers.
hello. Diane, listen,
I just want to say that I am truly sorry, but, you know, I can be such a bastard.
thank you, Roan. one more thing.
yes?
duck!
Roan! Roan, are you there?
is he alive?
we got him, General. He's right here.
are you okay?
I still got it.
Where's the bar? - Come on. Let's go.
let's get out of here.
here is to the woman who blows everyone else away.
seeing you in action again-- it was like old times.
old times?
I like to say "the '80s."
darling, listen, there's something... - I know.
you don't want to settle down.
you're not made for that.
you're a spy. That is your life.
almost like you rehearsed that.
it was my speech to you.
you changed your mind, too?
why did you hunt me down?
Roan, you never run away from a general.
Yes, of course.
but I do hope our rendezvous aren't over.
Budapest last spring was divine.
well... I have high hopes for Morocco tonight.
good for you, Kath.
mom.
30 more seconds, then we check the temp.
mom?
what is it?
having you here has been great.
but you are ready to try it on your own.
I get it. - No. No, it's not that.
I would keep you here forever, if I could.
mom, do you really want to be a full-time grandma?
it's okay.
this is what I dreamed of for so many years.
I made Chuck quit the CIA, and sometimes I wonder if that was the right decision, because I know that he's a good person who's helped people, and he's protected us.
he's a Bartowski.
and he says that you're the best.
if you need to be a spy, that's not another abandonment.
you'll still be in our lives.
but that's my job.
you just have to be the best grandma in the world.
he was a big romantic.
and the greatest husband there ever was.
well, I'm glad we talked. - Me, too.
I think eloping just seemed like a way for me to avoid my family.
Sarah, you've done so much to help my family.
how can I help yours?
I don't know. It's different.
Sarah, come on.
it's our job to take care of some of the world's biggest problems.
terrorists and despots and oligarchs.
I mean, I think we can handle a family, even yours.
you are Sarah Walker, the most mysterious woman in the world, so as the future Mr. Sarah Walker, can't I get to know you better?
Hi, I'm Chuck. Here are a few things that umight need to know.
I'm putting together a new team, and I want you to lead them.
so this was your idea? use my father's program m putting together a new team, a make your own Intersects?
Vicki, no! Don't shoot!
Chuck, are you about to disarm a nuclear bomb using fruit juice?
agent Bartowski, you will oversee all aspects of the Intersect project from here on out.
Mrs. Woodcomb? - Yes?
I believe that I have something of yours.
great news. I found my dad's computer.
wow, Dad.
still at it, babe? - Yeah.
did you get Clara down?
hon? - What?
Oh, my God. I'm so sleep deprived, I...
I'm not tired, although I feel... I feel totally awake, you know?
you're in the zone. How's it going? - My dad's work is so amazing.
I've never seen such creative experimentation in neuroplasticity before.
his mind is... incredible.
that's probably where Clara gets it.
she said "arthroscopic" yesterday.
honey, if Clara can say "arthroscopic" she needs to stop pooping her pants.
you sure you should be digging around on your dad's computer?
I mean, like you said, what if it's... dangerous?
well, I don't know. But I've never seen anything like this before, Devon.
I think that he was working on getting the neural circuitry in the brain to reorganize itself.
it's... It's fascinating.
don't worry, honey. What's the worst that could happen?
Beckman
good morning, team.
as you know, today begins the agency's new agenda:
find Intersect candidates who are as similar to Agent Bartowski as possible.
thank you for joining us, Director.
the Intersect clearly works better in Chuck than in anyone Director Bentley was able to find.
so sorry.
this time our search will be led by the only man who really knows what it's like to be an Intersect.
Chuck, we need you to find more Chucks.
well, it's going to be tough, you know... broke the mold, etcetera.
just a reminder...
you are all to provide support to Agent Bartowski in any way he requires.
Chuck, you're in charge. - Thank you, General.
in charge. Well, man, I'm-I'm-I'm moved, here. I'm so proud of you.
well, thanks. I - I appreciate the sentiment, Morgan. But it's really not that big a deal.
although it does seem like it's been four years in the making.
glad it hasn't gone to your head.
I'm just saying, I may have saved the city by disarming a nuclear bomb using a juice box...
Yes, you did.
but, be careful,'cause remember last time you were in charge, you led our party of D and D adventurers to their fiery deaths.
we've been over this, Morgan, okay?
if Tom had cast the spell of confusion, then we would have been out of that situation...
well anyway... that's neither here nor there!
but I do want to address the elephant in the room, which is, you know, "reporting to me," which can be a little weird or awkward for some of you...
but I think you're all very important.
I hope you enjoy this. I'll be back in charge as soon as you and your...
stupid pocket protector screw it up.
um, excuse me. Pocket protectors are not only very practical, they are required Buy More attire, lady.
okay! Well, using my own personality as a guide,
I've created an extensive psychological profile.
Langley culled their database for matches and sent me four spies that are perfect candidates.
they're going to be here in an hour.
good Lord. Four more Chucks.
all right. First up is Lewis.
Tech-ops specialist. Star hacker by the age of 14.
his Warcraft Guild took down Deathwing, World First.
no. - Yes.
and the coolest part... - Good afternoon.
he spent some time in England.
so he has a delightful English accent.
Josie. Psy-ops genius.
a real feeler and emoter, with a scary sense of intuition, which makes her great in the interrogation room.
I get it.
you had to get a girl to find someone as feely as you.
bogie. Get down! - N- n-no. No, no, no. Not a bogie, guys. Not a bogie.
this is Damian. Former Navy Seal. Marksman award.
but because of his appearance, he's been typecast by the Agency.
spent the last ten years embedded in one terrorist cell after another, and he's really sick of the desert. Which kind of reminded me of...
when I was stuck in the Buy More.
I think he could really shine in an opportunity like this.
and last, but the opposite of least...
Brody. The Brodster. Nerdy.
emotional. Into his family and friends.
disarmingly attractive.
dear God, there's another one.
okay. Let's get to work, huh?
Casey, you'll be handling physical testing.
Sarah, you'll handle psychological evaluations.
so. You're in the field and you have a conflict with your partner. What do you do?
you want me to say that I'd talk about it right away.
but what I'd really do is manipulate my partner into doing what I want.
and Morgan... you're in charge of evaluating the candidates' cultural knowledge.
rush's best album.
caress of Steel. - No. Next!
I find that few conflicts come up if everyone can just be civil.
charlton Heston sci-fi question for you.
what's cooler: Soylent Green or Omega Man?
trick question: POTA.
can somebody bring Lewis an icepack?
favorite Bond: Connery excluded.
I have no opinion about any of this. Why do men care so much about these things?
nothing you're asking me matters at all.
what on earth is she talking about?
I'd talk about it, right away, for as long as it takes.
nothing should ever wait or be left unsaid.
sometimes it's best to say things two or three times, even.
most important graphic novelist: Grant Morrison or MooreGibbons?
kind of a Brian Vaughn man, myself.
actually... I've always secretly felt that way.
so, time to pick a new Intersect. You ready, Chuck?
Yes. Yes. I'm ready.
I was, uh, I was honestly feeling... kind of nervous earlier.
but I went upstairs, got a little fresh air, and now I am ready.
I just feel bad for the others, though, you know? I mean...
we've really started to become friends through all this. I'm the "cool boss.
Yes, you are incredibly cool. Now, who are you going to choose?
well, what's your vote? I mean, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I don't value your opinion.
my opinion is, you're going to screw it up.
what is the diff... Man, she hates me.
well, you did steal her job. You're her nemesis.
I hate being a nemesis. Maybe I should take her out to coffee.
Bentley's no joke. You should stop trying to befriend her and watch your back.
the only thing that's going to make her look worse than this whole Greta debacle is you succeeding where she and I couldn't. Now...
who's the new Intersect?
Chuck
nice!
what are you doing?
that's the best kind of day there is.
now hand me some of them flyers, and let's sell some TVs.
I'm-I'm sorry, Big Mike. Why are you wearing the big B. M?
I thought that we retired it.
it's for the new LED flat-screen TV sale.
the Large Mart has the same promotion going on today.
those bastards! They don't respect us.
I mean, the last five promotions that we've had, Large Mart has had the same ones!
if we don't do something special they are going to hand us our head in a handbasket, just like always.
I don't know if that's... quite the expression.
but, I-I-let me tell you something. You do not have to sell yourself like this.
say what?
other men wear collared shirts all day, while I get to wear a...
a great big B. M. on my chest!
that's job satisfaction. - If you say so.
you know, son, as leader of the Buy More, you set the tone.
look, I know you got a lot going on here.
but remember, the Buy More is a special place.
it can be fun here!
okay. Okay. You're right. You know what?
let's have some fun, huh? All right.
Hey, gang.
say, uh, has anyone seen Brody? - No.
no. - Haven't seen him.
all right.
well, I guess Chuck has made his choice. - Nobody ever picks me.
Hey, Devon, what's up? - I think I have some bad news.
Ellie's been working on your dad's computer. - What?!
that was supposed to be under lock and key. How did she get it back?
she said some woman brought it over.
told her that the Buy More tech dudes gave it to her by mistake.
no, no, no, no, no.
Chuck, I would told you sooner but I didn't think she'd find anything.
but Chuck, she's making progress.
okay, look, it is very important- imperative even
that we stop that work immediately. - You should see how happy she's been.
I think the work is making her feel close to your dad again.
listen, I'm stuck here for a little bit. So I need you to take care of this right away.
just replace the computer's hard drive with a blank one when Ellie's not looking.
she'll think it just broke again.
and-and I'll take care of the rest. Bye.
director Bentley? Director Bentley, I need to ask you, - did you give the Orion computer to my sister Ellie? - No.
well, I don't mean to offend, but I don't believe you.
you shouldn't. I gave it to her. - I knew it! I knew it, I knew it.
okay, maybe you were unaware that I feel very strongly about keeping my sister away from the CIA, but now that you know that, I hope that you respect it, because I'm in charge.
the problem is, I don't respect you.
Hey, hey, you can resent me all you want - whether you like it or not, this is my project for a reason.
I'm going to tell Brody he's the new Intersect. A choice I feel very confident...
what the...?
it's blood.
and there's so much of it. It's coming from over there.
well, there goes your first choice.
dear Lord! There's been a murder!
so, Large Mart claims that this kidnapping is in retaliation.
see, I know no one here would break a two-year prank detente with the Large Mart because, I as your leader, have forbid it.
Why? Because it's just that important.
but there you have it.
they claim we kidnapped Kevin Bacon.
what did you two do?
Oh, you put Kevin Bacon in a closet?
Really? - Listen, we had to.
otherwise, they would have dominated us just like always, right?
cause weirdly, an adorable little pig attracts more customers than a large man wearing a big yellow and green B. M.
call me crazy.
sweet. - I'm buying whatever he's selling.
I can't believe he's dead.
how could this happen on my watch to my top recruit? Who would do this?
well, nobody's been in Castle for a week besides us, Bentley and the recruits.
that means the killer is still among us.
that's it, all of them.
and the one in your skivvies, mate.
it's like D and D all over again. - Okay, you are still in charge.
you need to be calm and confident. But just remember, we need to figure this out, okay?
right. Calm... confident.
okay. Okay, here's the situation, people.
castle is officially in lockdown.
which means all cell phone use is blocked.
we will be going over all of the surveillance footage and interrogating each and every one of you.
now, Casey, Sarah, a little sidebar. - Looks like some of us are above suspicion.
Yes. Why do they get to keep their weapons?
Yeah, who the hell are they?
okay, enough of that.
Casey here has been a part of Team Bartowski proudly, for years now, and has saved my life countless times.
Oh, I get it now. You're the Intersect's brainless heavy.
Colonel Casey would never kill anyone...
who didn't deserve it. - What about her?
uh, I think I can safely say that my fiancee here would never kill anyone...
who didn't deserve it. - Your fiancee, huh? Now I see it.
what is that supposed to mean? - Wait, ba-ba-ba-ba, okay, okay.
you go back over there. You go back over there. You come over here.
as I was saying, it is not Casey, nor is it Sarah.
so therefore, the killer must be one of you.
right. Let's blame the swarthy, bearded guy. - No, no.
I have lots of friends who are terrorists. This is just what my face looks like!
I didn't spend the last ten years in a cave for my country to have to deal with this.
I'm totally out of here. Oh, and by the way, I'm Greek.
Greek? I wouldn't have guessed that. Damian, wait!
don't shoot anyone, Casey. Damian, wait. Wait.
Damian, halt. Please halt. Please, just... - No, just, no! I'm leaving now.
Damian, no!
just get me out of here. - He's losing a lot of blood.
I need a doctor!
I'm grabbing some bandages. Let's just put some pressure on the wound.
Sarah, everything is off-line. We can't access the surveillance videos anymore, and all communication channels with CIA are dark.
good job getting the emergency lights back up.
the bomb was linked to the three others. The main power grid is out.
since the doors were already on lockdown, we're in here without any support.
we're trapped? This is not going well.
listen to me, Chuck, the most important thing about leadership is to convince everybody that you have everything under control.
what if instead Casey was in charge, yeah? Or maybe you could be in charge.
it doesn't work like that. I had my shot.
almost nuked the Inland Empire.
these people have been following you for a week.
Chuck, look, you're not in charge by accident. You did disarm a nuclear bomb using fruit juice.
okay, you can do this. We're right behind you.
Thanks.
okay, okay, so- so here-here-here's the thing.
we are officially locked in, now, with a killer, but not to worry
I have everything under control.
I feel calm.
bloody hell, we're sitting here disarmed and the meat head has all the guns.
Casey, listen, you need to swallow this, okay?
what's most important now is to support Chuck. He needs to look like the boss.
fine.
I still don't trust an American operative with a British accent.
well, it's not my fault. It's from my semester abroad.
wait, one semester? You got an accent from four months in England?
Yeah, that's really annoying, dude.
well, it's not that bad.
first off, I'd like to thank all of the Large Mart representatives for coming.
sincerely, I cannot apologize enough...
just give us Kevin Bacon, and peace can be restored.
fine. Fine.
I would like proof of life.
see, you have a certain human being of ours, and, uh, I'd like to speak with him.
you won't be able to track the signal, so don't bother.
big Mike? - Hello, son.
thank God. Big Mike, it's so good to hear your voice. I was sick.
I can't go a whole day without my number two. How are you doing?
I'm fine. Whatever you do, don't give in to Large Mart's demands.
of course I'm going to give in I got to get you out of there, okay?
do you want me just to call the police? - Uh, the police have no jurisdiction here.
this isn't anything that can't be handled of the shopping center.
and anyway, I'm having a nice time.
they brought in Subway flat bread breakfast sandwiches.
the steak, egg and cheese ones? - With chipotle southwest sauce.
it reminds me of your mama. Muy caliente. - I've heard enough.
he has heard enough.
okay, Marvin, here we are. Take your pig and...
this some kind of joke?
where is Kevin Bacon? - I don't - I don't know.
okay, Marvin, you have my word. I will get to the bottom of this.
but you need to give me till midnight, and I will find your pig.
Yeah, well, if you don't, I can't promise your friend's safety.
but I can promise you this
a big flaming B. M.on your doorstep.
Devon, I had a breakthrough. - What's going on?
well, I had an epiphany between baby yoga and music.
I was trying to figure out how my dad's research added up , and then I thought about Clara, and about how she's learning stuff so fast.
my dad was trying to figure out a way to input knowledge into the human brain without having to learn it.
I mean, think about the implications, Devon.
he left that knowledge for me for a reason, and I... and I figured it out, but why?
I just - I don't know what he wanted me to do with it.
I just wish - I wish he was here.
we do.
so, Director, the way I see it, you've got more motive than anyone.
you hate that I'm in charge. You want my program to fail.
and you've said very mean things to me all day.
I would never do anything like this. - Oh, wouldn't you?
I mean, you've already gone after my sister, so clearly you are willing to do anything to benefit your own project.
including murder.
and you're the only one who knew that Brody was my first choice.
Brody made you light up like a 13-year-old girl.
everyone knew he was your first choice.
what? Really?
I don't know what else you want me to say.
I didn't do it!
I'm not buying this whole weepy thing. It doesn't fit your profile.
you're not the only one who's trained in psy-ops, you know.
you've been hiding something from us all week and you've been highly emotional.
for your information, I'm emotional because
I got dumped last week by my boyfriend for being...
too emotional!
look, I don't do too well with girls and crying.
you know what I mean? Maybe we should be a little easier on her.
she's trained to do this, Chuck. Do not let her manipulate you.
okay, fine, I won't, I won't.
this is torture! You're torturing me!
no, we're not! No, we're not torturing you! There's no torture going on in here!
although there is no clear definition. - Sarah...
look, we're gonna get you some more painkillers very soon. But first, you're gonna answer a few more questions, okay?
for example, why is your bag covered in sand, huh?
which happens to be a great way to throw off our X-ray equipment. Mighty convenient.
old school. I like it. - It doesn't even work...
because there's sand in it.
Lewis, my tech guy...
and suspiciously, an elite bomb specialist.
you knew I had high hopes for you. Maybe that was your motivation.
I mean, you knew that Brody was my first choice and that you were my second.
no, I didn't know that, but thanks for not choosing me.
you didn't, you didn't know that?
Oh, looky what we have here!
sharp! - Can you explain this?
uh, it's my knife.
Yes, but why do you have a knife used by an IRA bomb maker in your bag?
because I killed an IRA bomb maker and I took it from him.
Walker, Bartowski, you figure
no luck. It could be any one of them.
all we know is that whoever the killer is, they were sitting in that chair.
I'm not even sure that we know that much.
actually, Sarah, I'm pretty certain, as there is a bomb strapped to the bottom of the chair. We gotta go right now!
did you feel that?
I haven't felt anything for years.
what's happening?
my ears are ringing! I can't hear anything!
are you okay?
Walker, glad you're still alive. - Yeah, I'm good, too. Thanks, buddy.
Damian caught another piece of shrapnel, this time in the back.
Oh, my God, we gotta get him to a doctor!
we will. Unless we die here. Then he'll have to wait.
everyone's here except Lewis. - Yeah, of course, the bomb expert.
he must have set up the bomb so he could get away, which means...
Lewis is the killer. - Seriously?
he was my second choice.
this is our Big Mike.
he's in real danger here, fellas. Real danger.
think about it: what if these men were to take away his sandwiches, hmm?
he is not built for that.
so I have to ask you one more time, okay: Where is Kevin Bacon?
I don't know what to say, my friend. It's a...
it's a mystery. It's an unsolvable mystery.
it is not a mystery! In fact, it is quite obvious what has happened.
you stole Kevin Bacon, and therefore you two hid him, hmm?
or... did we?
okay, Damian's unconscious, but he's still alive, for now.
look, the good news is we can trust each other again.
Lewis is clearly the one who planted the bombs and killed Brody, who probably caught him in the process.
we're gonna need all hands on deck. Lewis is in Castle with nowhere to go.
that guy can build a bomb out of anything. Watch for trip wires, booby-traps.
Yeah, also remember it's important that we capture this guy alive. Okay?
we need to find out who he's working for. Why he would have sabotaged Castle.
you just gonna stand around and talk about it, leader?
no, I'm gonna find Lewis and I'm gonna take that bastard down.
listen, Director, I just wanted to apologize for accusing you of murder.
and if you promise to stay away from my sister, I think we can get past it.
maybe even become friends. - Do you know what your problem is?
you want people to like you too much. A good leader shouldn't care about that.
sector Two clear.
you don't understand, six years we were together.
I mean, how did you get the Intersect to commit?
sector One clear.
clearly, you feel that way, as you haven't made even the slightest of attempts to be liked.
that's not important to me. - Really? Not even a little bit?
what, are you made of stone?
did you hear that?
guys, I hear movement in the ducts.
Yeah, I hear it too, Chuck. It's Lewis.
I lost him. Casey, you got anything?
I'm right underneath him.
freeze, Limey, if you want to keep your balls.
what the hell? - What is it?
it's a pig.
a pig?
you hid Kevin Bacon in the air ducts?
if you love something, let it go.
if it comes back, you can eat it.
he lives by a strange philosophy of karma and diet.
it combines the two. But it works for him.
a pig? Did he really just say...? - That means Lewis is still out there.
and all I've got is you. - Where you going?
I'm going to the Intersect room. It's bombproof and it's the safest place in Castle.
don't you...?
director, stop! I command you!
I don't wanna pull rank here, but you can't just walk away from me like that.
Ooh, you don't want to pull rank 'cause I may not like you?
what is that?
that is none of your concern. - It is absolutely my concern.
it's my father's research. It's my sister using the computer... - It's government property! It's a matter of national security!
national security? You're putting my family in danger! - I am protecting my country and saving my project from you!
do you see him?
I see him.
we got you, Lewis. There's nowhere left to go.
I think we can safely say that Lewis is not the killer.
brilliant deduction, Sherlock.
that means the killer's still out there.
leaves just the ladies. Figures. All right, let's finish this.
it's not me, so that leaves you. - My sentiments exactly.
all right, everybody shut up and put your weapons down.
unless it's one of them.
drop your guns. - You drop your guns!
I want this to be over! - This is a mess.
okay, leader, whatcha got? Who's the killer?
there's been a murder!
I know who did it. - What?
at first, I thought Brody's killer had to be Lewis, since it made sense that my second choice would want to kill my first choice.
so I'm not your first or second choice. That's good to know.
no, no, no, no, no, no, look, look, I loved all of you guys. Really.
it's just that there can only be one number one and one number two, but they're both dead now.
and if it makes you feel any better, I did suspect you of being the killer for a little while, mainly because of your... volatile emotional state.
sorry. - But you're not a murderer.
while going through your things, I found the pregnancy stick. You're expecting.
Congratulations. I hope you're blessed with a boy.
so, which brings me to where my suspicions have been pointing the entire time.
you must be joking.
only one person was unaccounted for during Brody's and Lewis's murders...
my opinion is you're going to screw it up. ...
and who has unique access to Castle's infrastructure.
I'd be very careful.
I know it isn't you. - What?
she had ample opportunity to kill me, and she didn't take it, okay?
I just wanted everyone on this side of the room so I could quietly tell you: it's Damien.
he's the killer, and he's probably armed.
let's do it. - I'll flank him on the left.
I got your right. - I got your back, Chuck.
how about we go with Plan "B," Chuck?
you're going to let me out of here.
you're going to get me to a doctor, or... ...
I'm going to blow us all up. - The boombox? Really?
I - I guess actually I should've expected that. Look, be rational, okay?
you want to get out of here just as much as we do. - How do you know what I want?
I wasn't even one of your choices.
cause you don't want to die. You've wanted out of here all along.
Brody caught you planting the explosives in Castle.
what are you doing? - That's why you killed him, and had to cover your tracks.
but when we locked this place down, you knew it was only a matter of time before we knew that you were the killer.
and that's when you really committed. By blowing yourself up.
knowing where the explosives were placed, you used the door to shield yourself from the blast.
bold move.
I had no choice. - But the bombs locked all the doors.
so you tried a new method.
thinking that if we had a killer in mind, we'd get you out.
so, you planted a bomb under your chair, during your interrogation.
this is torture! You're torturing me!
when the bomb went off, you used the chaos as cover to kill and hide Lewis.
but unfortunately for you, we found him.
so now we know whhappened, but we don't know why.
who are you working for, Damian? What are they after?
I came here for you, Chuck.
now, you're going to get me out of here.
Chuck... You know what you have to do.
we can't let you leave. You know that. So just put the bomb down.
no, thanks. It's your choice, boss.
Sarah, the bomb's been activated. - It's okay, Chuck, you can do this.
I can, normally, yes, but not this fast. There are so many security measures, I just can't defuse it in that amount of time.
Chuck, keep everybody as far away from the Intersect room as possible.
no, Bentley! Bentley! What are you doing?
the Intersect room is the only room that can contain this blast.
the power's out, the doors won't shut!
there's a manual release. - No. No, no, no, no, there's got to be another way.
this is what a leader does.
I hotwired the control panel, using my stupid pocket protector, thank you very much.
okay, come on. We don't have time. - go go go and for saving Castle from destruction.
and a special commendation to you，chuck.
you were a true leader. - Thank you, General.
but I'm only as strong as the team that surrounds me, and, as always,
Sarah and Casey were my eyes, ears, and more today.
I'm glad you feel that way, because this is the team we're sticking with.
following the security breach, it has been deemed too dangerous into a new recruit.
Chuck, At least for foreseeable future, you are to remain the only Intersect.
director Bentley, you will reassignment in Washington.
general, if I could just add something quickly.
director Bentley was invaluable today.
noted. Well done, team.
so this is it, huh?
you're a good spy, Chuck Bartowski.
I'm sorry for underestimating you.
thank you.
it's good to not have a nemesis anymore.
you know... your sister is incredibly smart.
if anybody can figure out the Intersect, it's her.
you might want to reconsider keeping her away from her path.
enough is enough.
we are not going to let Big Mike just sit there and rot. - No!
who knows what those Large Mart heathens could be doing to him?
so I'll tell you what we're going to do. We're going to break him out.
look! He's alive!
Hey, how did you get free?
it was easy, they had a couple of nerds watching me.
my shift was over. I ain't staying late!
I'm glad you're okay. - Yeah, we're all glad. We're all glad you're okay.
large Mart rules!
our B. M.
it's okay, son. It was worth it to have some Large Mart fun again.
we can make another B. M.
is this a Large Mart pig? - Yeah, of course it is.
Oh, hey. Let me guess.
Jeff and Lester stole the porcine victim, Large Mart snatched Big Mike in retaliation, he was able to liberate himself, but they still torched the big B. M. on your doorstep.
you, you left out, uh...
nothing, no, that's right, that's exactly right. - I figured as much.
Yeah, pretty much. What happened to you? - It's been a long day. To say the least, yeah.
I'll just leave it at that. Here you go, here's Kevin Bacon.
Oh, come on, buddy. Come on... He also ate a lot, so... just...
no, no, that's good, I could kinda...
I'll, uh, I'll be right in.
so I took care of things on my end. Ellie won't be bothered again.
how's everything going here?
it's done.
the computer's taken care of? - Kaput.
it's for the best.
right? - Totally. Yeah.
so... we're still not telling Chuck, right?
no. We don't want him to worry.
well, guys...
I want to apologize for all the grief you had to swallow to support me.
Chuck, that's not necessary. - I think it is, though. I... I do.
I would've fallen apart today if it weren't for the two of you.
it's not just the computer, or the man.
the Intersect is all of us. It's the three of us, working together.
that's why it works.
don't ever forget that.
good. You're all here. I wanted to get in touch with you right away.
we've interrogated Damian, and he wasn't trying to obtain the Intersect.
he was simply hired to bomb Castle.
have we figured out who he was working for?
it turns out Damian than was wired $10 million by none other Vivian Volkoff.
it appears she's going after the man who took down her father.
wait! Wait, wait, Vivian Volkoff is trying to kill me?
your team will be contacted should any more information surface. alert.
for now, remain on high - I'm someone's nemesis? - For real, this time.
hi I'm Chuck.
here are a few things, that you might need to know: Wait...
Vivian Volkoff is trying to kill me?
it appears she's going after the man who took down her father.
Captain: I've got some bad news.
Ellie's been working on your dad's computer.
my dad was trying to figure out a way to input knowledge into the human brain without having to learn it.
CHUCK: Replace the computer's hard drive with a blank one when Ellie's not looking.
I'm great Mom, you know?
uh, she's sleeping halfway through the night, now.
and Devon has that breast-feeding simulator which is great, so...
I'm-I'm fine.
you know I love babysitting my granddaughter, but I am a trained spy.
what gives?
I didn't want to say anything until I had any solid conclusions, but...
is that your father's old computer?
Yeah. I found it underneath the seat of his Mustang.
I had a major breakthrough a few days ago, and then I found thousands of pages that I've never seen before, all labeled X.
how far into them are you?
not very.
but there's references in here to you and Dad, and this Agent X.
do you... know anything about this?
no. Did you happen to run this by your brother?
no. I don't want Chuck involved.
I mean, obviously this has to do with Dad's spy life.
look at this.
this Intersect project: downloading information into the human brain.
this is amazing stuff.
I've never heard of it.
do you think that Dad actually had the Intersect up and running with this Agent X?
I really don't know, honey. I don't know.
all right. I'm going to go give Clara her bottle.
I'll be back.
: Oh, Stephen, what did you do?
eddard, you don't let your kids keep a direwolf.
that's a terrible idea.
are you ready to head out?
will you sign these when you get a chance?
just wedding prep docs.
prospective husband... Prospective wife...
Walker, the Somali pirates want to take him.
if you go in with all that firepower, it's gonna be a bloodbath.
if you want Charles out alive, I need to be there.
fine.
I can't go like this. They'd laugh.
let me get a little something out of my prison kit. Please.
pick a game.
dice, roulette, cards. You win, the tracker is yours.
I win, you die.
do you have Uno?
honestly, sweetheart, I copied one file to cross-reference in the CIA database, but when I put the flash drive in, it disappeared.
well, Mom, why didn't you say anything?
I know it's important to you, working with your dad's computer.
and I just, I felt stupid.
well, it's okay.
the computer automatically embeds the backup files in the hard drive, so I didn't lose anything.
Oh, good! Good. - Yeah.
honey, if we're gonna make that reservation, we should get going.
okay.
okay.
okay.
okay.
go on! Get out of here! Have some fun!
all right. We'll see you in a few hours.
okay.
Ellie, let's drop this plan and actually go to dinner.
Devon, the woman has the technical savvy of Steve Jobs.
she didn't just "erase" a file.
so we're gonna stand out here in the cold and wait for her to maybe do something?
we didn't have to wait very long, did we?
she's doing it!
okay, um, she's spending the night, we follow her in the morning, and we see what she's doing with the file.
el, we're not spies.
Devon, we are gonna act like it because she's keeping something from me and I want to know why.
the tracking device.
draw four.
you're a cheater! You just cheated! He cheated. He just cheated.
I just saw you palm a card out of your...
tell it to St. Peter, dead man!
Hello, Ellyas.
VOLKOFF: You cheated. Give him the targeting device.
you are supposed to be locked up.
what the hell is happening here?
I'm gonna show you what the hell's going on here.
your morality is in a state of development.
for once in your life, you're gonna play fair.
the tracking device or your life.
take it. It's yours.
thank you.
we do have one problem.
what's the problem, Volkoff?
there's something I've gotta do. And it's gonna be really painful.
Casey, we need to get out of here right now.
got it. Let's roll.
come on, Alexei, we gotta go now!
you know me, you know what I'm capable of, Ellyas.
the time's come for me...
for me to...
apologize.
I want you to understand that I... like all other men...
I'm still a work in progress.
what do you say, Ellyas? Forgive and forget, right?
okay?
okay...
go!
CHUCK: Okay, okay.
give me that. - I feel so free!
CHUCK: Do you? That's good.
thanks so much for your time. Such a good feeling, isn't it?
here we go. Let's go.
thank you, Mogadishu, and good night!
VOLKOFF: All that remains is the killing agent... thorium.
my finest piece of work.
where does it come from? - A far-off land.
to mine it, I had to wage war against the peaceful natives and ordered the destruction of their Hometree.
I'm just kidding.
they showed it to us last week... Avatar.
so it's rare. Incredibly.
and the chances you don't know its location are pretty slim.
well, my grandmother always used to say, play your cards close to the vest.
and wear a coat over the vest or you'll look like a jerk.
team, good progress, but Langley is getting antsy.
well, General, we think Volkoff knows where the killing agent is, but he's being very uncool about it.
VOLKOFF: General... I want proof you're going to keep your side of the bargain.
there is a classified document on the conference table...
a communication between Vivian and the CIA.
it's been redacted, but you'll get the gist.
I guess you're just going to have to trust us.
thorium's in a Swiss military bunker. The locks are coded to my DNA.
we fly at midnight. Fuel my jet.
you don't have a jet.
of course. Old thinking. It creeps back.
let's creep back to your cell. Come on.
okay, honey, I'll call next week. And if you need anything, you call me.
okay. - Thank you.
Bye.
target's on the move, Hot Mama.
ELLIE: Copy that, Six Pack. You get the car. I got the baby.
meet me at 8: 00, the shooting range to celebrate.
love, Alex.
Hey, I just got your text. What's going on?
your sister is breaking through the firewalls of the Orion computer.
what? No. No, no, no, no.
I mean, I knew about that, but I had Awesome take out the hard drive and disable it.
well, he didn't. And the progress she's making in her access...
it's almost as if your father intended for her to find out about the Intersect.
Oh, my God.
I've taken files piecemeal.
I think I got the dangerous ones, but she's onto me.
she's following me.
okay. Okay. Let's think about this. Let's think about this.
what are we going to do?
the time has come for her to find out what it is you do for the CIA.
no. Mom, we've been down that road before... okay?
and if she gets the truth now, she could end up resenting me for all the lies I've told, and it'll tear us apart.
well, she is finding out on her own, which could be infinitely worse.
our family has relied on secrets and lies for way too long.
CASEY: Bartowski. Beckman's on the monitor.
I'll be right there.
not you, Bartowski; the other Bartowski. She says it's urgent.
we'll discuss later.
okay.
general, I'd like this second file from Orion's computer to be the last that I acquire.
it's not going to be easy to keep secrets from my daughter much longer.
cards on the table?
washington is hungry to expand the Intersect program, and Ellie has unlocked material our best technicians couldn't get near.
we've never even heard of Agent X.
well, neither have I, but that does not mean that it's related to the Intersect.
still, it seems like Ellie has exclusive access.
the director wants her to keep working.
Diane, she's not a spy. She's my daughter.
Mary, I'm sorry, but it comes from the top.
Volkoff is here?
what the hell is going on?
he got a 48-hour furlough to get us a weapon called the Norseman.
it-it wasn't in your Volkoff file, but have you heard of it?
just whispered about. Never laid eyes on it, which is worrisome.
watch your back, Chuck.
maybe he's a changed man. He asked to see you, to make amends.
we're talking about Alexei Volkoff. His mind is twisted.
never believe a word he says, and never let him out of your sight.
you understand?
cool.
swiss alps
Sarah: No guns, no ambush. Maybe this isn't a trap after all.
Yeah. Can't trust a Limey with good teeth.
well, we have Mr. Cool in there.
what do we have to worry about? Bartowski, we lose audio, we're coming in.
sounds good, buddy.
the thorium is behind this door.
first, to get in, you got to win the game of chess.
it's fully automated and constantly evolving. Plus, there's a five-minute clock.
I'm guessing there's consequences if you lose.
: Oh, yeah.
well, you don't have to stay. You can wait with your friends.
well, Alexei, as much as I like staying away from life-threatening situations, wherever you go...I go.
fasten your seat belt.
it's going to be a bumpy match.
electronic VOICE: Welcome, Mr. Volkoff. Ready to play a game?
CHUCK: Alexei, just stay cool.
I know you don't like Bartowski's groovy attitude.
God knows where he gets these ideas.
Yeah, well, it kind of threw me when he just signed that prenup.
that's what you would have done.
exactly, but now I see what Chuck's side of it would have been like.
flipping out about our relationship boiled down to the contents of an envelope.
seeing the end before we've even started.
so why the prenup?
I have some money socked away, in case my dad gets arrested again.
well, I'm sure Bartowski could handle it.
any excuse to weep and hug.
Yeah, well, it's more about what it dredges up for me.
my relationship with my family and having to take sides.
caught between your parents, huh?
tough place to be.
hardest place for a kid is right in the middle.
Roger that.
electronic VOICE: Check, Mr. Volkoff.
Oh, shake it off. Shake it off. Shake it off. You're doing great.
you're still in check, Mr Volkoff. If this is Mr. Volkoff.
guns. Big guns.
lots of bullets.
sort of overkill.
story of my life.
what is going on with you? Come on. Let's do this.
I used to love games like this. I didn't care whether I lived or died.
now I do care. I don't want to die.
I'm going to lose, and I'm going to die.
no, you're not. No, you're not going to die.
we're not going to die right now. Look...
I get that you're trying to better yourself, but would a spiritual man freeze in the face of adversity?
would he...
would he choke and die so close to fixing things with his daughter?
no, he wouldn't, because he'd be cool.
it's not working. - Damn it!
you still have the DNA of the world's most evil weapons dealer.
you are a villain, sir.
your name strikes fear in the hearts of even the toughest of swine.
and that name is...
alexei Volkoff. You say it like you mean it!
my name... is...
world's biggest bad-ass.
killer of men, conqueror of nations.
let's not get ahead of ourselves. Game, guns, clock.
CHUCK: What's going on?
right into my trap.
checkmate.
good. Now, let's get a move on before the computer changes its mind, okay?
we're losing audio.
what is that we're picking up? Is that Russian?
Yeah. Go. - We need to go.
the last level of security is coded to my DNA.
I assume that's the thorium. Let's get this over with.
we'll get to that.
but first, I have an amends to make to you.
Oh, yeah? Well, uh, I'm pretty well aware of all the bad things that you've done, and I'm learning not to hold it against you.
it's not what I've done. It's what I'm about to do.
we just picked up some Russian on the radio. How long is this gonna take?
see, you were right. I'm Alexei Volkoff.
and always will be.
w-wait, wait, wait, wait. What is happening?
Oh, this is what we call the twist.
I have a company to run and I need leverage to run it.
the Norseman's the most dangerous weapon in the world.
I just needed my father's DNA to get the killing agent.
what? So this is a setup?
you were shot.
you two never communicated. - Yes, we did.
: the minute... the minute you showed me the Norseman component,
I knew it was a message from my daughter.
you and I are gonna run this company together.
there will be plenty of time for that, Father.
the thorium is useless without the other components.
the other components are what's useless.
they can be rebuilt.
but you'll never have this.
place the grenades.
VOLKOFF: Now, Viv, darling, get these handcuffs off your, off your father.
we've got a lot of work to do.
I'm sorry, Dad, but here's the real twist.
dead by your own plasma grenades, impossible to defuse.
young lady, you get me out of these handcuffs immediately.
this is your father talking.
trust no one. You taught me that.
it didn't include me.
Vivian, you are not this person. - You don't know who I am!
you have both lied to me, betrayed me and shattered my life!
VOLKOFF: Vivian, darling, I've always been on your side.
the photographs?
the necklace?
tokens from a stranger!
I don't know you.
I will never know you. Good-bye.
Vivian! Please!
come on, let's get to the bombs and see what we can do.
maybe if I can flash on the laser grid, I can get through them.
you gonna carry us on your back?
is there any other escape from this room?
she hates me.
no, she's... I'm sure she's just going through a phrase.
actually, I'm really sure she's not going through a phase, but you got to snap out of this right now.
just let me die. - We all die.
what would Dr. Nelson say?
he'd say that you're not seeing it from her side of the issue, you know?
if any part of your recovery was real, you'd see that she's just hurt and angry.
I failed her. - No!
you made a great first step in repairing your relationship.
it's just gonna take more work.
you really believe that?
Sarah: Chuck, we have to move... seconds left.
just forget about him!
hmm, modified, directed EMP.
this year's innovation.
I was gonna tell her all my secrets. We were gonna be partners.
not anymore.
: "Velcome" to the future.
CHUCK: Why did she do this?
she's my daughter.
she takes after me.
please, Charles, take me home.
I understand you wanted a minute.
Mary? You well?
what is it you wanted to say?
I've done terrible things.
I've been evil.
but I was drawn to the goodness in you.
Alexei, this is not necessary. - Yes, it is.
I was not worthy of your love...
like Orion was.
please accept my apology and know that I'm doing my best to improve.
thank you, Charles.
remember, family and friends are everything.
money, greed and power are a dance with Satan.
and he looks like me.
dad, don't say it again.
know what, we'll have dinner the day after graduation.
I don't want you lying to your mother on my behalf.
me neither, but lying to her kind of goes with our territory.
it's not fair for you to be torn between two parents. It's not okay.
you're my father.
I don't mind being in the middle, as long as that means I get to have you in my life.
I mind.
I respect that you don't want to tell your mother the truth, but...
we have to come up with a compromise. I can't be there on the day.
unless...
unless we tell your mom the truth.
that I'm alive. - Yeah.
I'll tell her the truth.
Oh, that scares me.
done. - You don't have to do that.
please forget that that ever existed, okay?
that is so not cool. - Just read it.
I, Sarah Walker, promise to... always love Chuck Bartowski.
in return, he will always love me.
I can't read this fine print.
the fine print says,"I promise Chuck that I will not even "contemplate the word 'divorce.
and I will never use my prenup.
I already signed it.
Thanks.
Sarah, I have to talk to Ellie right now or I'll lose my nerve, I know it.
Yeah, your mother is right.
Ellie's better off finding out from you than on her own.
should I finish my wine first? - Come on, she'll understand.
Chuck, being a spy isn't just what you do, but it's about who you are.
go and tell her.
Thanks. Be right back.
Hey, El. - Hi.
uh, Devon's putting the baby down.
let's, uh, let's go over here.
that's some look you got on your face.
I heard that you've been kind of busy lately.
Yeah.
a newborn will do that to you. - Yeah, uh, that's true.
Chuck, is there anything pressing going on? 'Cause, really, I should get dinner started.
el, I need to talk to you about Dad's computer.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I thought that I uncovered some secret files.
turned out just to be cheats on some video game that he was developing.
Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - Just gibberish, really.
listen, that Chicken a la King's not gonna cook itself.
so I'm gonna get in there.
okay. Yeah. - Okay.
my sister just lied to me.
she's never lied to me.
not cool.
we build the device as quickly as possible.
there was only one man my father was ever afraid of, one threat to Volkoff Industries.
he went by the name Agent X.
I'm gonna track him down and kill him.
then no one can touch me,ever.
hi I'm Chuck.
here are a few things, that you might need to know: Wait...
Vivian Volkoff is trying to kill me?
it appears she's going after the man who took down her father.
Captain: I've got some bad news.
Ellie's been working on your dad's computer.
my dad was trying to figure out a way to input knowledge into the human brain without having to learn it.
CHUCK: Replace the computer's hard drive with a blank one when Ellie's not looking.
I'm great Mom, you know?
uh, she's sleeping halfway through the night, now.
and Devon has that breast-feeding simulator which is great, so...
I'm-I'm fine.
you know I love babysitting my granddaughter, but I am a trained spy.
what gives?
I didn't want to say anything until I had any solid conclusions, but...
is that your father's old computer?
Yeah. I found it underneath the seat of his Mustang.
I had a major breakthrough a few days ago, and then I found thousands of pages that I've never seen before, all labeled X.
how far into them are you?
not very.
but there's references in here to you and Dad, and this Agent X.
do you... know anything about this?
no. Did you happen to run this by your brother?
no. I don't want Chuck involved.
I mean, obviously this has to do with Dad's spy life.
look at this.
this Intersect project: downloading information into the human brain.
this is amazing stuff.
I've never heard of it.
do you think that Dad actually had the Intersect up and running with this Agent X?
I really don't know, honey. I don't know.
all right. I'm going to go give Clara her bottle.
I'll be back.
: Oh, Stephen, what did you do?
eddard, you don't let your kids keep a direwolf.
that's a terrible idea.
are you ready to head out?
will you sign these when you get a chance?
just wedding prep docs.
prospective husband... Prospective wife...
Walker, the Somali pirates want to take him.
if you go in with all that firepower, it's gonna be a bloodbath.
if you want Charles out alive, I need to be there.
fine.
I can't go like this. They'd laugh.
let me get a little something out of my prison kit. Please.
pick a game.
dice, roulette, cards. You win, the tracker is yours.
I win, you die.
do you have Uno?
honestly, sweetheart, I copied one file to cross-reference in the CIA database, but when I put the flash drive in, it disappeared.
well, Mom, why didn't you say anything?
I know it's important to you, working with your dad's computer.
and I just, I felt stupid.
well, it's okay.
the computer automatically embeds the backup files in the hard drive, so I didn't lose anything.
Oh, good! Good. - Yeah.
honey, if we're gonna make that reservation, we should get going.
okay.
okay.
okay.
okay.
go on! Get out of here! Have some fun!
all right. We'll see you in a few hours.
okay.
Ellie, let's drop this plan and actually go to dinner.
Devon, the woman has the technical savvy of Steve Jobs.
she didn't just "erase" a file.
so we're gonna stand out here in the cold and wait for her to maybe do something?
we didn't have to wait very long, did we?
she's doing it!
okay, um, she's spending the night, we follow her in the morning, and we see what she's doing with the file.
el, we're not spies.
Devon, we are gonna act like it because she's keeping something from me and I want to know why.
the tracking device.
draw four.
you're a cheater! You just cheated! He cheated. He just cheated.
I just saw you palm a card out of your...
tell it to St. Peter, dead man!
Hello, Ellyas.
VOLKOFF: You cheated. Give him the targeting device.
you are supposed to be locked up.
what the hell is happening here?
I'm gonna show you what the hell's going on here.
your morality is in a state of development.
for once in your life, you're gonna play fair.
the tracking device or your life.
take it. It's yours.
thank you.
we do have one problem.
what's the problem, Volkoff?
there's something I've gotta do. And it's gonna be really painful.
Casey, we need to get out of here right now.
got it. Let's roll.
come on, Alexei, we gotta go now!
you know me, you know what I'm capable of, Ellyas.
the time's come for me...
for me to...
apologize.
I want you to understand that I... like all other men...
I'm still a work in progress.
what do you say, Ellyas? Forgive and forget, right?
okay?
okay...
go!
CHUCK: Okay, okay.
give me that. - I feel so free!
CHUCK: Do you? That's good.
thanks so much for your time. Such a good feeling, isn't it?
here we go. Let's go.
thank you, Mogadishu, and good night!
VOLKOFF: All that remains is the killing agent... thorium.
my finest piece of work.
where does it come from? - A far-off land.
to mine it, I had to wage war against the peaceful natives and ordered the destruction of their Hometree.
I'm just kidding.
they showed it to us last week... Avatar.
so it's rare. Incredibly.
and the chances you don't know its location are pretty slim.
well, my grandmother always used to say, play your cards close to the vest.
and wear a coat over the vest or you'll look like a jerk.
team, good progress, but Langley is getting antsy.
well, General, we think Volkoff knows where the killing agent is, but he's being very uncool about it.
VOLKOFF: General... I want proof you're going to keep your side of the bargain.
there is a classified document on the conference table...
a communication between Vivian and the CIA.
it's been redacted, but you'll get the gist.
I guess you're just going to have to trust us.
thorium's in a Swiss military bunker. The locks are coded to my DNA.
we fly at midnight. Fuel my jet.
you don't have a jet.
of course. Old thinking. It creeps back.
let's creep back to your cell. Come on.
okay, honey, I'll call next week. And if you need anything, you call me.
okay. - Thank you.
Bye.
target's on the move, Hot Mama.
ELLIE: Copy that, Six Pack. You get the car. I got the baby.
meet me at 8: 00, the shooting range to celebrate.
love, Alex.
Hey, I just got your text. What's going on?
your sister is breaking through the firewalls of the Orion computer.
what? No. No, no, no, no.
I mean, I knew about that, but I had Awesome take out the hard drive and disable it.
well, he didn't. And the progress she's making in her access...
it's almost as if your father intended for her to find out about the Intersect.
Oh, my God.
I've taken files piecemeal.
I think I got the dangerous ones, but she's onto me.
she's following me.
okay. Okay. Let's think about this. Let's think about this.
what are we going to do?
the time has come for her to find out what it is you do for the CIA.
no. Mom, we've been down that road before... okay?
and if she gets the truth now, she could end up resenting me for all the lies I've told, and it'll tear us apart.
well, she is finding out on her own, which could be infinitely worse.
our family has relied on secrets and lies for way too long.
CASEY: Bartowski. Beckman's on the monitor.
I'll be right there.
not you, Bartowski; the other Bartowski. She says it's urgent.
we'll discuss later.
okay.
general, I'd like this second file from Orion's computer to be the last that I acquire.
it's not going to be easy to keep secrets from my daughter much longer.
cards on the table?
washington is hungry to expand the Intersect program, and Ellie has unlocked material our best technicians couldn't get near.
we've never even heard of Agent X.
well, neither have I, but that does not mean that it's related to the Intersect.
still, it seems like Ellie has exclusive access.
the director wants her to keep working.
Diane, she's not a spy. She's my daughter.
Mary, I'm sorry, but it comes from the top.
Volkoff is here?
what the hell is going on?
he got a 48-hour furlough to get us a weapon called the Norseman.
it-it wasn't in your Volkoff file, but have you heard of it?
just whispered about. Never laid eyes on it, which is worrisome.
watch your back, Chuck.
maybe he's a changed man. He asked to see you, to make amends.
we're talking about Alexei Volkoff. His mind is twisted.
never believe a word he says, and never let him out of your sight.
you understand?
cool.
swiss alps
Sarah: No guns, no ambush. Maybe this isn't a trap after all.
Yeah. Can't trust a Limey with good teeth.
well, we have Mr. Cool in there.
what do we have to worry about? Bartowski, we lose audio, we're coming in.
sounds good, buddy.
the thorium is behind this door.
first, to get in, you got to win the game of chess.
it's fully automated and constantly evolving. Plus, there's a five-minute clock.
I'm guessing there's consequences if you lose.
: Oh, yeah.
well, you don't have to stay. You can wait with your friends.
well, Alexei, as much as I like staying away from life-threatening situations, wherever you go...I go.
fasten your seat belt.
it's going to be a bumpy match.
electronic VOICE: Welcome, Mr. Volkoff. Ready to play a game?
CHUCK: Alexei, just stay cool.
I know you don't like Bartowski's groovy attitude.
God knows where he gets these ideas.
Yeah, well, it kind of threw me when he just signed that prenup.
that's what you would have done.
exactly, but now I see what Chuck's side of it would have been like.
flipping out about our relationship boiled down to the contents of an envelope.
seeing the end before we've even started.
so why the prenup?
I have some money socked away, in case my dad gets arrested again.
well, I'm sure Bartowski could handle it.
any excuse to weep and hug.
Yeah, well, it's more about what it dredges up for me.
my relationship with my family and having to take sides.
caught between your parents, huh?
tough place to be.
hardest place for a kid is right in the middle.
Roger that.
electronic VOICE: Check, Mr. Volkoff.
Oh, shake it off. Shake it off. Shake it off. You're doing great.
you're still in check, Mr Volkoff. If this is Mr. Volkoff.
guns. Big guns.
lots of bullets.
sort of overkill.
story of my life.
what is going on with you? Come on. Let's do this.
I used to love games like this. I didn't care whether I lived or died.
now I do care. I don't want to die.
I'm going to lose, and I'm going to die.
no, you're not. No, you're not going to die.
we're not going to die right now. Look...
I get that you're trying to better yourself, but would a spiritual man freeze in the face of adversity?
would he...
would he choke and die so close to fixing things with his daughter?
no, he wouldn't, because he'd be cool.
it's not working. - Damn it!
you still have the DNA of the world's most evil weapons dealer.
you are a villain, sir.
your name strikes fear in the hearts of even the toughest of swine.
and that name is...
alexei Volkoff. You say it like you mean it!
my name... is...
world's biggest bad-ass.
killer of men, conqueror of nations.
let's not get ahead of ourselves. Game, guns, clock.
CHUCK: What's going on?
right into my trap.
checkmate.
good. Now, let's get a move on before the computer changes its mind, okay?
we're losing audio.
what is that we're picking up? Is that Russian?
Yeah. Go. - We need to go.
the last level of security is coded to my DNA.
I assume that's the thorium. Let's get this over with.
we'll get to that.
but first, I have an amends to make to you.
Oh, yeah? Well, uh, I'm pretty well aware of all the bad things that you've done, and I'm learning not to hold it against you.
it's not what I've done. It's what I'm about to do.
we just picked up some Russian on the radio. How long is this gonna take?
see, you were right. I'm Alexei Volkoff.
and always will be.
w-wait, wait, wait, wait. What is happening?
Oh, this is what we call the twist.
I have a company to run and I need leverage to run it.
the Norseman's the most dangerous weapon in the world.
I just needed my father's DNA to get the killing agent.
what? So this is a setup?
you were shot.
you two never communicated. - Yes, we did.
: the minute... the minute you showed me the Norseman component,

you and I are gonna run this company together.
there will be plenty of time for that, Father.
the thorium is useless without the other components.
the other components are what's useless.
they can be rebuilt.
but you'll never have this.
place the grenades.
VOLKOFF: Now, Viv, darling, get these handcuffs off your, off your father.
we've got a lot of work to do.
I'm sorry, Dad, but here's the real twist.
dead by your own plasma grenades, impossible to defuse.
young lady, you get me out of these handcuffs immediately.

I don't know you.
I will never know you. Good-bye.
Vivian! Please!
come on, let's get to the bombs and see what we can do.
maybe if I can flash on the laser grid, I can get through them.
you gonna carry us on your back?
is there any other escape from this room?
she hates me.
no, she's... I'm sure she's just going through a phrase.

I understand you wanted a minute.
Mary? You well?
what is it you wanted to say?
I've done terrible things.
I've been evil.

Alexei, this is not necessary. - Yes, it is.
I was not worthy of your love...
like Orion was.
please accept my apology and know that I'm doing my best to improve.

I, Sarah Walker, promise to... always love Chuck Bartowski.

Chuck, being a spy isn't just what you do, but it's about who you are.
go and tell her.
Thanks. Be right back.
Hey, El. - Hi.
uh, Devon's putting the baby down.
let's, uh, let's go over here.
that's some look you got on your face.
I heard that you've been kind of busy lately.
Yeah.
a newborn will do that to you. - Yeah, uh, that's true.
Chuck, is there anything pressing going on? 'Cause, really, I should get dinner started.

there was only one man my father was ever afraid of, one threat to Volkoff Industries.

Freeze!
take it easy, Tiger, I'm-I'm here to help.
DS&T picked up some chatter of a possible break-in attempt.
not likely.
it's always a ghost town down here.
Oh, damn it.
I'm sorry, I haven't had my morning coffee yet.
let me, um... help.
who says chivalry is dead?
good work.
I knew there was a reason I brought you, outside of the obvious, of course.
that's the computer with all the Agent X files?
no, it's a tracker.
somebody must be using the computer.
but it looks as if the CIA is keeping tabs.
locate this signal, and we'll have exactly what Miss Volkoff wants.
this was too easy.
have to imagine the CIA is being way more careful with the actual computer.
Oh, shoot. Ellie, come on.
Hey, babe, doing a little last-minute prep for Chuck's bachelor party.
can you give me a little sunscreen pre-coat?
sure...
uh, make sure you lube up the lats.
gonna be sunny in Vegas.
what's with the old house?
that? I figured out a cyclomatic complexity that ran through all the conditionals in my dad's research
that's the end of the loop.
awesome. - All paths seem to end at that photo.
I don't understand - why would my dad want me to have this picture of an old house?
what are you doing, El?
aren't you supposed to be getting ready for Sarah's bachelorette party?
honey, don't worry. Clara's already at your parents' house,
I am all packed for our girls' day trip;
I promise I will turn it off as soon as the festivities begin.
okay? - Fair enough.
gonna finish packing for the dude trip.
Vegas, baby. Vegas...!
may I ask the best man what casino we're going to be hitting first?
I got a fat stack burning a hole in my crotch.
I- I don't think that's, uh... - Oh, no; it's burning.
uh, no-no idea, actually. I put Awesome in charge of everything.
apparently, he's the Vegas expert.
nice. - Yeah.
what about you, Casey? Any casino preferences?
no. Forget the casinos.
best thing about Vegas are the gun ranges.
brought some of my fancy targets.
well, I got some bad news.
see you guys on Monday.
hang on, Big Michael.
you're not coming?
Bologna Grimes says I couldn't go.
she knows I tapped Vegas dry back when I was with Earth, Wind, Fire, and Rain.
you want me to call this Baloney lady, give her the what for?
Nah. Once Bologna has made a decision, there's no going back on it.
you guys enjoy.
No! No-no-no-no, no-no-no-no.
hold on a second. Hold on a second.
y - You are my future stepfather.
this will not stand. Now, come on...
we're men! Men who take what's theirs!
you have to march into that house, slam your fist on the counter, and then you look at my mother in the eye, and you say, "Bologna, I am so sorry, woman...
... but I have to work at the Buy More all weekend. " You see, this way, when she asks me, I'll say, "Yeah, we got all this new inventory. We have to work around the clock.
boom! Boom.
that's the greatest thing... a white person's ever done for me.
let's go to Vegas!
Vegas, Vegas. What does a bachelor wear in Vegas?
I can't believe you've never been to Vegas.
and, by the way, a bachelor does not wear that.
what?
you're not digging the whole business up-top, party below-the-waist thing?
I figured it covered all the Vegas activities with one fell swoop.
speaking of "looks," you're sure doing an awful lot of maintenance over there.
Oh, I'm just reminding you of what you'll be missing out on in Vegas.
Oh, trust me, I'll remember.
Where's Ellie taking you guys anyway?
I'm not sure.
every time I do recon, she's on your dad's computer.
she spends a lot of time on that thing.
Yeah, well, Ellie's always been into puzzles; you know, logic puzzles,
sudoku, crosswords - I mean, one of my earliest memories of my sister was when she solved the 12-sided Rubik's Cube before I even got mine out of the box.
have you spoken to Devon yet?
told him that you know that Ellie is still using the computer?
no. Not yet.
I'm planning on having a good man-to-man talk as soon as we get to Vegas.
I mean, it's the perfect place to have a sincere, honest, heartfelt conversation.
you really have never been to Vegas, have you?
Awesome...!
let's go, let's go, let's go!
uh... just a minute, Chuck! Coming!
Hi.
what's up?
I was just, uh, I was reading a book.
you don't have to lie to me, Ellie.
I know you're planning Sarah's bachelorette party
come on, we've all got some secrets. Don't we Awesome?
you don't know the half of it, bro.
let me tell you something.
this weekend... I'm going to make a man out of you.
goody! Can't wait for that
okay, well, you guys have fun.
be safe, and I'm just... I'm going to do stuff.
okay. - Okay.
Bye. - Bye.
we finally have a lock on the Orion computer signal.
echo Park, Los Angeles.
perfect. Let's move.
all right, boys.
I want you to get ready.
even if you've been to the City of Sin before, you've never been with me.
awesome, thank you so much for planning this trip.
dude, you kidding? I live for this.
okay, we need to think of this weekend like a war.
now you're talking my language.
when we get there, we immediately take over The Strip.
high rollin' on The Strip!
what the... Ow! Ow!
what are you doing?!
I'm making it rain- Canadian style- which is, technically, making it snow.
save the Socialist funny money.
and save your energy. Vegas is the land of excess.
for those of you who like to chase tail, there is plenty of that, too.
rest up, boys... 'cause we might not sleep again for a long time.
bachelorette weekend. I Cheers.
so, are you going to let me in on the big secret?
what have you got planned for tomorrow?
okay, we are going to a spa in Santa Barbara, and we're not just doing massages we're doing body scrubs, too.
wow, uh... That sounds very... relaxing.
get ready for some hardcore aromatherapy.
all right, boys! Let's tear this town a new one!
Yeah! - Woo-hoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
welcome to Las Vegas, boys!
captain, what's, uh, what's-what's going on? This is not Las Vegas.
Las Vegas, buddy. Look!
so this whole time you've been saying "Las Ve-cas"?
of course! What else would I be saying?
Las Vegas.
hold on a second, I heard you say we're going to the City of Sin.
this is the City of Cinn...
among Falls. After the famous waterfall.
the locals call it the "City of Cinn.
what about taking over The Strip?
Yeah, the old mining strip. It's next to the campsite.
I thought we were going to chase tail.
there's a huge yellow-bellied marmot population.
they love being chased.
long as I can set up a gun range.
Yeah, nature's gun range - the great outdoors.
Hey. You okay, buddy?
I know that you were looking forward to partying in Vegas most of all.
what? I knew we were going to Vegas!
Oh. This place is amazing!
they grow some magic fungus up in them their hills.
I'm going to go find some; maybe chase a little tail.
that's the spirit, big guy!
Yeah! Let's get unpacked.
well, I better go unpack and rest up for the big day.
rest up? This is your bachelorette party.
we have to get you tired before you can rest.
tired? - Come on...
surprise!
Yeah!
come on, you didn't think I was just going to take you to some lame spa, right?
I tried to call the girls from the CAT squad, but they were away in Libya somewhere, so I invited a few of the Wienerlicious girls and some friends from the hospital.
thank you. This is a very nice surprise.
I know it's not going to be like as crazy as Vegas, but, uh, we'll have a few drinks, see where the night takes us.
okay. Okay.
all right, boys.
get ready for the bachelor party hike.
I figure we can forage for our supper out there.
I do not forage.
okay, look, guys, I know this isn't exactly Las Vegas, but Awesome worked really hard putting this all together, you know?
got to admire the man for sticking to his strategy.
sure, and you know what?
a hike actually sounds pretty invigorating right now.
I've never hiked in a tie.
I know, right?
Yeah. Get the blood pumping.
I mean, it could be just as fun as Vegas.
cause this weekend is-is... it's about bonding after all, isn't it?
no. No, it isn't. - Not at all.
Amen.
Michael, may I have a word with you over there by that crappy tree?
listen. I have a plan.
don't bother telling me - I'm in.
all right.
you were the best, wiener girl.
Hey, Chuck, listen, the secure CIA location has been compromised, and we need to bring in the Orion computer immediately.
can you please call me back and tell me where your sister keeps it, okay?
call me.
okay, game time!
let's give our bride-to-be a toilet paper dress!
Oh, listen, Ellie, can we please talk? I want...
Ellie, wait. We need to talk.
okay, Ellie, no, this... Listen, this can't wait. Okay, my...
my employer knows about... about your father's computer, and...
and I have to take it to a secure location right now!
Why? Why? What happened?
the signal is coming from a mile up the road.
okay, there's nothing to be alarmed about.
it's just, the CIA had a breach of security, and your dad's computer could be involved.
Oh, I should have known something like this would happen. I'm so sorry, Sarah.
I... I was accessing a lot of weird stuff on that computer.
something about an Agent X and an Intersect program.
I hid it in here.
this isn't my bag. This is Devon's bag.
he must have taken it by mistake.
you know, it's okay. There is nothing to worry about.
nobody is in any danger.
okay.
lock and load!
Oh, okay, uh, I mean, do you mind if I make a phone call?
Oh. Okay.
I'm sorry. I don't mean to look at... I'm sorry.
okay, General, I need you to put me in touch with our agents in Las Vegas, please.
Ooh, um, is that a gun? No.
this way.
that's a... That's a pretty fantastic hike. Thanks.
Yeah, absolutely.
I'm glad those other dudes found some stuff to do.
Vegas has got a lot for everyone.
right in the ribs.
listen, since it's, uh, just the two of us, you mind if we talk, man-to-man?
sure.
I know that you didn't take the hard drive out of my dad's computer.
I'm sorry, Chuck.
it just made Ellie so happy. I couldn't do it to her.
I get it. I-I get that. And I'm happy that she's happy.
and I'm happy that she's continuing my father's work.
it's just that these secrets - they're...
I feel like they're tearing my family apart.
down, down.
kill that light.
Devon, why would you bring that to my bachelor party?
Oh, no. I must have grabbed Ellie's bag.
this is the device Miss Volkoff wants.
it has all the Agent X files.
Casey, we cannot let her access the information on that computer.
sweep the woods. Leave no witnesses.
Jeff Hey!
you guys here for the bachelor party?
awesome brought entertainment.
do you like this?
cause I got three more where that came from.
laptop
who's this Vivian Volkoff?
it's a long story. Actually, it's pretty easy.
I mean, it's Chuck's nemesis.
he put her old man behind bars, she sent an assassin to blow up Castle.
what about Agent X?
I think I might be Agent X.
Chuck, I am so sorry that I let Ellie touch your dad's computer.
Chuck, I'm so sorry I let this guy plan your bachelor party.
this is so awful.
Oh, yeah.
let's get this party started!
my sentiments exactly.
the CIA cracked the encryption.
I'll upload the files to Miss Volkoff.
Yeah, but first, find out how much he knows.
if he doesn't talk, see that he never talks again.
welcome back.
you know why I'm here, don't you?
is it because I've been a bad boy?
what's in the shooter?
sodium pentathlon - truth serum.
freaky. I don't think that'll mix with what I'm on.
guys- Jeff- they're torturing him.
Lester and Big Mike can wander in at any second.
we got to do something. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Casey, what's the plan?
who was that?
mercenaries. Ex-Green Berets, judging by their tactics.
I count three, including the leader in camp.
guys, did you see that clean break?
maybe I can save him.
no, he's dead, and so are we, unless you three tighten up.
what's this?
you and Morgan are gonna find some good strong sticks and start sharpening.
Yes, sir. Perfect.
sharpening what?
toothpicks.
spears, you idiot.
I'll draw the rest of the team out into the woods.
I'm sorry. You want us to fight former Green Berets with spears?
not you. You're gonna go down to the camp and spring Jeff.
happy hunting, boys.
happy hunting?
looking. Looking. Looking.
I'm showing the nearest casinos in Las Vegas, Nevada.
did you say Las Vecas?
I did not. - Well, no. We have to stay local.
there's got to be a nightclub or a bar or... a liquor store or...?
Vegas! Vegas, Vegas, Vegas.
are you saying Vecas...? - Don't play with me, boy.
we are getting the hell out of here.
this is not what I signed up for.
wait.
No! We can't just leave them. They may die out there.
take the drama down a notch.
I only care about Jeff.
what? What is it?
a splinter, I think.
let me take a look.
Oh, please. Listen to me. There are men trying to kill us.
I can handle a little splinter, all right? I mean...
Ooh, it... it hurts!
Morgan, you ever kill a man?
I'll tell you something.
the first one... the first one's the hardest.
there's no doubt about it.
Really? - No, not really.
they don't even give me a gun on missions.
are you kidding me?
I'm a doctor. I took an oath to preserve lives.
what about your own life? Dude, you heard Casey. It's them, or it's us.
what if we met these guys at a bar?
you know, we could be frat brothers, for all I know.
frat brothers - these are mercenaries, dude. Drinks? Beers?
you hear something?
no. You're having first "mish" jitters.
it's not my first "mish. - " I think it's your first "mish.
how are those spears coming?
you are lucky we didn't kill you with these spears! They are really sharp.
you ought to. They're dead.
dead? Well, what are these for?
they kept you out of my way.
men, what's your status?
Oh, poor baby. you're fresh out of friends.
looks like Well, in that case, I'm just gonna have to come out there and kill you myself.
the captive's unconscious.
kill him.
I see you've had knife training.
let me give you one final lesson.
it's over.
it's over.
sorry to interrupt your little lap dance.
if anyone's still alive, meet me at the extraction point.
what the hell's going on?
Jeff's having a bad trip.
we've got to get out of Vegas now.
good thing you boys came to your senses.
best bachelor party ever.
Vecas, baby! Yeah.
Hey, where have you been?
Yeah, wrong Vegas.
so where is Orion's laptop? Beckman thought that
she was right - Vivian Volkoff sent a team for it.
they tried to kill us.
I've got to tell Ellie what she got herself into.
if I didn't grab the wrong bag, you girls would have been ambushed.
I agree - Ellie deserves to know.
I'll tell her.
I feel responsible that the CIA used her to find Agent X.
no, I'll tell her.
but then you'll have to tell her the truth about you.
I know.
what are you doing home?
uh, I had to cut the bachelor party short.
there-there's something that's been on my mind.
what is it?
we've always been able to tell each other anything, right?
lately I felt like...
like there's something in the way.
Yes, exactly, our family is so full of secrets.
too many secrets.
I mean, our parents alone. - Yeah, and, and, and I don't think there should be any secrets between the two of us.
I've been working on something secret.
I didn't want to tell you because I didn't want you to worry and...
I know about Dad's laptop and his research - Mom told me.
so why are we here?
you're still a spy.
wait, w-w-wait, wait, wait a second,
I had a whole speech and you just figured that out.
you can't figure that out by yourself.
I think I just did.
you just Rubik's Cubed me, sis.
of course you still work for the CIA.
Sarah's a spy, you're clearly built for better things than the Buy More.
you're not mad?
I'm not mad that you did it.
I'm mad that you didn't tell me.
I mean, I get it - it's the same reason that I kept Dad's computer a secret from you.
no more secrets, though.
one more little secret.
look at this place.
what are you guys guarding down here that's so important?
el, you know that Intersect project that Dad was working on?
Yeah, I've been trying to figure it out for weeks.
it's in my head.
what?
no... Uh, Morgan, Katana sword, please.
Oh, yes, yes, Katana - all right.
uh, full speed or half speed?
full speed, thank you.
okay, okay.
Banzai...!
sleeveless.
pretty cool, right?
our dad was amazing.
he did it.
he actually figured out a way to program the human brain using...
what happened?
I was going to use this to find Agent X.
Ellie, you found him.
you're looking at the first human Intersect - it's me.
no, not unless he gave it to you before you were born.
november 21, 1980.
what, there was an Intersect before Chuck?
from what I can piece together from his files,
dad used this program to input a new identity into an operative.
so Agent X could go undercover.
but once he went undercover, something went wrong.
dad must have felt responsible for it and that's why he spent his whole life looking for him.
not that that's going to happen now.
Ellie, I haven't spent ten years in the Nerd Herd for nothing.
Morgan, get my tools.
Yes, sir, of course.
what tools?
for fixing computers.
tools for fixing computers, coming up.
well, I might as well get started on this inventory.
somehow my cover story became the truth.
hold on a second.
let me ask you two a question.
who am I?
you're Big Mike.
no, I'm Rain of Earth, Wind, Fire, and Rain
and Rain does not waste a free party pass.
neither does Thunder.
is that name taken?
okay, wait, wait - are we going to go to the real Vegas?
no. - Well, then...
me and the boys had a standing engagement in a city that makes Vegas look like the Vatican.
what is this mythical place?
go get my Corolla.
got it.
okay, here, uh, here are the files.
his whole file's been redacted.
except for a name - Hartley.
he did leave something else.
I have no idea what it means or if it's some sort of clue.
I know where that is.
what, how?
the Intersect - that's incredible.
Yeah.
Ellie, look at that date.
it's a week before Agent X went missing.
do you think maybe he took the photo as a keepsake before his final mission?
this place must be special for him.
maybe it's his home.
or some kind of safe house.
you think Agent X has been hiding out there for 30 years?
what's going on?
we're not the only ones trying to find Agent X.
the people who put that hole in Dad's laptop - they're after him, too.
well, I'm coming with you.
what, are you crazy?
no, two words: Baby Clara.
what about you?
don't worry about it.
it's what I do.
30 years.
looks like somebody's still living there.
if this Agent X guy has been hiding from the CIA all these years, he might not take too well to being found.
Oh, hello.
may I help you?
so sorry to disturb you ma'am, but our car has just broken down, and I was looking in the, in the boot - the bonnet.
uh, long story short, we're stranded.
could we please use your phone?
Oh, of course, come in.
I'll make some tea while you wait for the lorry.
thank you. - That way.
Cheers, lovely.
what's taking her so long?
will you relax, Casey?
you don't think she's Agent X, do you?
I don't know who the hell she is.
that old bird could be poisoning our tea as we speak.
here we are. Nice cup of tea.
now, get it while it's hot.
and this one is for you.
thank you.
delicious, thank you.
so where are you all from?
um, not far from here, actually.
I was just showing my fiancé?
a bit of the countryside before the wedding.
he's American, of course.
and this handsome young man?
he is-is a hitchhiker we picked up on the edge of town.
Yeah, he had such a nice face, we figured, what the hell?
uh, I was just telling my fiancé?
that my father had a friend who lived here, actually.
in this house?
Oh, how interesting.
Yes, I believe his name was Hartley.
any relation to you?
Oh, no, I'm just an old spinster.
but I do know the man you're referring to.
he was the previous tenant.
a bit of a recluse, judging by the way he left the place.
Oh, do you know what happened to him?
no, I'm afraid not.
thank you for the tea.
maybe we should go and wait for the tow truck.
but he did leave behind a box of personal effects.
Oh, I'd forgotten all about it.
I mean, it has been 30 years.
Oh, well, I'd hate to bother you.
no, you're welcome to it
well, if your fiancé would kindly give me a hand?
I believe it's a bit heavy.
I would love to.
wait here while I grab a torch.
delightful.
tell me who you are, and what you want with my son
before you make me go ruin my wallpaper.
please, please, ma'am, I'm-I'm here to help your son.
I'm here to help Hartley.
I'm with the CIA.
so, you're saying you work for the people who took my son?
give me your sidearm.
ma'am, I actually don't carry a gun.
Hartley should never have been sent undercover.
he was a scientist.
when the CIA couldn't bring him in, they disavowed him.
no one lifted a finger!
they did, they did!
my father, he spent his entire career trying to find Hartley.
you're Stephen Bartowski's boy?
you knew my dad?
of course.
he and Hartley were quite close.
are you gonna fix my son?
this is the place.
looks like someone beat us to it.
move out.
not bad. - Great.
we're outgunned and outmanned.
what are you waiting for, laddie?
lay down some fire.
who are these people?
mercenaries. Must have followed us.
they're not after you.
they're after the same thing you came for.
Hartley's spy will.
here.
there's a vault in the cellar.
you'll find the spy will down there.
go!
Oh, put down that damn peashooter.
there's a real gun in the chest.
there.
I prepared for something like this.
you know how to feed one of these things?
please!
where would you put a spy will?
there go my primroses!
eat lead, you bastards!
bingo.
we're out.
now what?
we'll have to scuttle the house.
go! Go! Go!
you're like the mother I never had.
Oh, and charming to boot.
come on, let's go find your team, so we can get out the back door.
what's she doing?
you don't want to know.
ready?
Oh, no.
Oh, you remind me of my son.
he didn't care much for guns, either.
whatever it was in this box,
I hope it's what you're looking for.
only a few more hours till we hit Reno.
Reno?
more like Reen-yes!
Yeah.
it practical.
Oh, man, this is my jam!
this yours?
Reno, here we come!
we're here.
Really?
Jeffrey, this isn't Reno.
um, yeah, it is.
good Lord!
I can't believe this is happening.
you're welcome.
no, no, no, no, no!
I blame you, Michael!
wait. Stop killing. Stop the killing.
what's that over yonder?
boys, we're here.
let's make it snow!
remember, boys, the joker's worth 13.
are we waiting for a code from the CIA to open it or something?
I was just waiting to open it with you.
so the identity of Agent X is inside that box.
our dad's obsession.
the whole reason that our family fell apart.
Wha...? Volkoff?
agent X is Alexei Volkoff?
I know this man.
mom brought him to the house for Thanksgiving.
he's a spy, right?
no, not exactly.
Yeah, but he wasn't.
I mean, that's the thing.
Volkoff was a cover identity.
in reality, he was just a scientist who didn't like using guns.
so Dad's original Intersect created
we should talk to Mom.
maybe she was trying to fix him, too, you know, in her own way.
we need to call Beckman, see what our next step is.
no. We tell no one.
interrogation room. Now.
it ends here.
we're all gonna pretend we never saw this.
John, my dad clearly wanted Chuck and me to figure this out.
there must be a reason.
look, the CIA created one of the most murderous men in the history of the world.
there's powerful people who spent an enormous amount of energy covering that up.
you know what happens if they find out we know?
they order a guy like me to put a bullet in each one of our heads.
so we're supposed to just sweep this thing under the rug?
Ellie, we're talking about the CIA.
there are rules.
what about Dad? What about Dad?
what if his plan was just to get us to search together? You know?
we haven't exactly been the most honest siblings the past couple of years.
no, we haven't.
but this search...
it made us rely on each other.
be honest, work together.
what if that was only half of it?
I - I don't think that we're supposed to stop here, Chuck.
I don't think that we're supposed to just find Agent X.
we're supposed to fix him.
this isn't for the CIA to solve, Chuck.
I think this is for us.
hi i'm chuck. here's a few things you may need to know
there was an Intersect before Chuck?
dad used this program to input a new identity into an operative, but once he went undercover, something went wrong. The program took over.
agent X is Alexei Volkoff?
the CIA created one of the most murderous men in the history of the world.
you know what happens if they find out we know?
they order a guy like me to put a bullet in each one of our heads.
the Norseman device.
it can kill a single person in the middle of a crowd with 100% accuracy.
God, what is that noise?
Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, no, no, no, no, no, help me!
five days ago
you awake?
are you thinking about the wedding?
it's exactly one week away, one single, solitary week.
Chuck, what if it rains?
that's good luck, right?
well, what if it doesn't?
are we freaking out? We're freaking out.
that's normal, though, it's normal to freak out a little bit a week before a wedding.
unless...
it's cold feet?
no, no, no, because I want to marry you.
I really want to marry you, too.
it's just the church and exchanging intimate feelings in front of a crowd.
wait, what if we did a dry run? - A dry run?
Yeah, yeah, a dry run, you know, that way we can work out the kinks no people, no cameras.
practice makes... - Perfect.
we'll be ready for anything.
the poison is called thorium.
I don't know much about it other than seeing it kill a room full of men.
thorium is a radioactive metal, not a poison.
was it liquid or solid?
liquid, yellowish. It's linked to her DNA somehow.
then the thorium's been synthesized. Devon, do you have any ideas?
poison guns aren't in the textbooks. She's burning up.
I need a bath basin stat.
hypothermia will decrease the heart rate and hopefully slow down any tissue damage.
Chuck, if she's going to survive the next 24 hours, we need to know exactly how this poison works.
and if it's exotic like you're saying, we need to find an antidote.
okay, I told everybody at the party that she had food poisoning and that she's going to be fine.
she's going to be fine, right?
Hey. Hey, baby, hi, I'm right here.
you look worried.
no, you know, it's just, just wedding stuff.
don't freak out.
we're ready for it.
baby, I'm going to fix this.
we're going to get married and be together forever.
I love you.
there's only one person who can get us that antidote, and it's the man who made the damn thing.
well, Volkoff's in a super max penitentiary.
it'd take weeks to get clearance.
well, then, I guess we're just going to have to break in tonight.
river hill peritentiary
mom, we've reached Volkoff's cell.
copy that, Chuck, you have precisely two minutes before the alarm system comes back up.
already open.
that's not right.
Casey, where is Volkoff? - He's gone, Agent Bartowski.
stay where you are.
Chuck, what is going on in there?
I know that voice.
Casey, you're going pale. I go pale, you don't go pale.
remember when I told you opening up the Agent X files would draw out a remorseless son of a bitch that would destroy our whole team without breaking a sweat?
this is the guy they hire to kill that guy.
agent Bartowski, Colonel Casey.
listen, pal, I don't know who you are and frankly I don't care.
I need Volkoff to save Sarah Walker's life. Now, where is he?
name's Decker, Clyde Decker,
I'm informing you of a wash order on the Agent X program and and Operation Bartowski.
what does that mean? - It means your CIA resources are revoked.
but Sarah is dying. - I don't care!
now, stand down or get buried.
no. - No?
let me explain.
that guy might think he's a hard ass, but I'm the Intersect.
let's move.
Sarah's temperature is down, but it's not stabilizing.
what does that mean, El?
well, there's signs of a total body dose of radiation.
she's breathing on her own, but she's in and out of consciousness.
how long does she have?
at this rate, I would say that she has 12 hours.
she's here.
thanks for helping us, General.
decker is transporting Volkoff to a black site outside Phoenix.
no one who's gone in has ever come out.
we need to intercept Volkoff in transit.
they're on the 10 East an hour ahead of you.
well, then, we need something with speed.
can we still get into Castle?
Chuck, you realize, if you go against Decker, you're going against the CIA.
you and Sarah will have to disappear forever.
you'll never see your family again.
I'll do anything I need to do to save Sarah.
this should work.
so what's the bright idea, Chuck?
and why are you keeping us in the dark?
I want the Nighthawk.
absolutely not. - A prototype never been tested.
11 hours and counting I don't give a damn.
you're not even supposed to know about the Nighthawk.
come on, you thought you could keep a super bike secret from me?
she'll do 250 on the highway.
you two will navigate from Castle.
Chuck, have you ever even ridden a motorcycle?
and I hope to God the answer is no.
Charles, I know time is of the essence, but you are driving awfully fast.
sorry, Mom.
don't get all icy on me, Volkoff.
I come in peace.
this transfer is not about killing you. CIA wants you for some testing, that's all.
testing?
regarding Agent X.
you playing coy or you don't remember any of this?
Casey, Casey, I'm coming up on the transport.
your real name is Hartley Winterbottom.
nobody names a person that.
Volkoff is a fictitious profile you created with Stephen J. Bartowski.
what on earth are you talking about?
tech boys wanted you sans Volkoff, so...
do svidaniya, Alexei.
Casey, Mom, light it up.
hold tight.
we're under attack. Volkoff has been breached. Need backup.
Chuck, you have 60 secondsto get him out of there.
they've called in air support.
Hey.
come on, wake up. You're coming with me.
I am? Why?
Vivian shot Sarah with The Norseman I don't have time to explain everything right now.
who shot whom with what?
Bartowski, you are galactically insubordinate.
I'm almost impressed. I'm taking Volkoff with me.
one problem that ain't Volkoff. His name's Hartley.
Volkoff was an Intersect implant.
it's gone now.
hello.
gentle as a lamb.
give up, Chuck, you're done.
um, um, Bartowski. Are you related to Stephen Bartowski?
I'm his son, and you're coming with me right now.
on that? That looks very dangerous.
I said now!
you are kidnapping a government prisoner, peckerwood!
hang tight.
in 30 years?
is he still in charge?
if only.
the Volkoff profile that you and Stephen developed for the Intersect was only supposed to last for a couple months.
what did I do? I mean, what did Volkoff do for 30 years?
what kind of a man was I?
you were very successful in a highly competitive business.
no, Mary. There's got to be more to it than that.
if someone's been struck by The Norseman.
Hartley, I'm sorry, but we don't have time for this. Okay, please.
I need your help to save her life.
right, right, The Norseman. Um, it was developed alongside the Intersect.
and it was a weapon of deterrence.
they were going to collect the DNA of all the top black marketeers in the world.
Oh, you could whack 'em if they got out of line. That's smart. Reagan smart.
peace through violence.
remember, it was the '80s.
Hartley, is there an antidote?
iridium 5.
okay, how how... how do we get it? - Oh, it's simple.
I can make that for you.
great. That's great. That's fantastic.
we'll talk on the way to the hospital. Let's go.
once we secure the antidote, we'll discuss our plans for Viv.
Yeah, gal named Vivian fired The Norseman on Sarah.
which doesn't matter right now. What does is the antidote.
Charles, who's Vivian?
it's a Winterbottom family name.
she's your daughter. - My daughter?
and she's your enemy?
it's a long story. Terrible mistakes were made.
and now we have to clean them up.
will you help me save Sarah?
Yeah. Of course I will. - Thank you.
okay, here we go.
okay.
that's all you... That's all you got there?
I mean, these are our wedding vows, after all, so...
I think I covered the bases.
okay, cool. Yeah, good, good.
you go, then I'll go, and then we'll have a little note session afterwards.
okay. I'm just gonna go... - You You go, mm hmm.
Chuck,"you're a gift.
you're a gift I never dreamed I could want or need,"and every day,
I will show you "that you're a gift that I deserve.
you make me the best person I could ever hope to be, and I want to spend and learn and love the rest of my life with you.
talky?
perfect.
so perfect. So perfect. Oh, my God.
Oh, mine are a tear down. This is a page one rewrite.
I scripted a wardrobe change. You know, and a pause for applause.
Chuck, don't freak out.
whatever they are, they will be perfect.
something's wrong.
the Iridium slowed the spread of the poison, but her temperature is creeping back up.
what are we talking about?
I think that you bought more time, but she's still deteriorating.
okay, okay. Okay, what's next?
I don't know. - What do you mean, you don't...
come on. Come on, people, think. Think about this.
if there's an Iridium 5, there's got to be an Iridium 6, right?
about four years ago, Volkoff was working on a new compound. Very secret.
file was labeled "Lead Apron.
which is a way to protect against radioactive poisoning.
Volkoff must have known that...
no, must have known that number five was weak, and developed the next stage antidote, Iridium 6.
Volkoff kept the project close, at his Moscow base.
el, what's our time frame?
a day, maybe less.
and we're out of here ASAP.
I still have friends in Global Strike Command.
they'll be happy to give us a free jump to Russia. They love mixing it up with the Reds.
you may be the Intersect, boy, but you can't outrun a bullet.
so, of course, Chuck goes marching back to these bullies, and he demands them to give me back my pants.
says he's gonna call the Intergalactic Firestorm Federation, which, by the way, doesn't exist.
there's no such thing.
Chuck just, you know, made it up on the spot, but, uh, he got me my pants back.
you know, I love those pants.
anyway, long story just to say that...
Chuck never gives up.
you know that already.
what are you doing? Sarah's dying!
I'm aware of that. - You're aware of that?
I can save her. Please. She's CIA, just like you, Decker.
let me go get the antidote. One last mission. That's all I'm asking for.
you're fired, Chuck. As of... right now.
operation Bartowski is done.
the Buy More is for sale. - Fine. Fine. Fire me. Just let me go.
Chuck, there is one last thing I need from you. Some CIA property.
what is that? - A suppression device.
they say it only hurts... a lot.
what...
no. No, no, no, no, no!
don't take the Intersect! I need it for the antidote.
I need it to save Sarah!
I know, Chuck. I know.
No! No!
what do you want, Clyde?
you're going to convince Agent Bartowski and his mom that this is over.
no one can know the true origin of Alexei Volkoff.
uncuff him.
John, I don't need to threaten you to follow an order. You're a Marine.
now, you're going to do this to protect the greater good.
your country.
I'm onto you. You know I'm not gonna bail out on Walker.
you think I'm just gonna accept your offer, try to escape with Frost and Chuck.
but it's a setup. And when I make my move, you kill us all.
in the report, you make yourself out to be the good guy, right?
a real hero.
it's all right.
see... John...
I'm not afraid... to be the bad guy.
neither am I.
Hey, Casey, what's up?
we're making our move. Does the CIA still havea man on you?
Yes. Yes, they do.
well, take him out now! Meet me back at the apartment.
Yes, sir. Okay, all right.
what's going on?
we're getting Chuck and Hartley out of here.
your mom and I are the magnet. We're gonna stay here and distract Decker.
you two get out in the confusion. It's the only way you'll make it to Moscow.
but Casey, they took the Intersect out of me.
shut up. You're Chuck Bartowski, the second best spy I've ever worked with.
now you're gonna go save the best one.
I I'm sorry. What am I supposed to do?
you and Chuck need to break into Volkoff Industries.
there'll be lots of security there, so, you'll have to go as your old self.
of course, as Volkoff.
Yes, but he's not you. He's a mean, dictatorial, conniving...
manipulative, amoral... - Limey with relatively good teeth.
sounds like I was a monster. - You were.
and you didn't tell me this for a reason?
my daughter.
I made her into Volkoff.
I'm sorry, Hartley.
Hey, guys, guys, we have a situation.
all right, we need to take out this CIA guard at the end of the hall.
what? Dude, we don't do that kind of thing.
wait. Morgan, is he dangerous? - Yes. Yes, very.
Devon, take him out. - Wait. What? No.
I'm standing right here. Okay, I'm the professional spy.
Devon will go and distract this guard. I will be the one doing the taking out.
little spy maneuver we like to call "the magnet.
so, what, you're gonna punch him out? - Mm. I don't know.
probably sweep the leg. Haven't decided. I like to improvise.
move. Up.
Chuck? New identities.
untraceable. Extremely rare.
I made them years ago for an occasion just like this.
you have to use them, Chuck. You and Sarah need to disappear.
got it.
Casey, if I never...
you get the antidote, you get it to Sarah, then disappear.
you do whatever it takes, you save her.
am I ever gonna see you again, Mom?
not if everything goes right.
good bye, Chuck. - I love you.
come on, come on.
all right, Morgan, sweep the leg.
or karate chop.
or roundhouse kick. Or running...
or, uh... Or, uh...
you are supposed to be the magnet. - Dude, sweep the leg? Come on.
in real life, you just make a fist and you hit him as hard as you can.
you got lucky.
nosow, russia
so this is it Volkoff Industries.
it's, uh...
very stark.
Charles, do you think this suit is a bit much? to.too much sheen
remember, Hartley, you are Alexei Volkoff, okay? Don't think about the suit.
just say as little as possible and we'll be fine. Think angry thoughts.
um, actually, my mind has just gone blank. I think I've forgotten the plan again.
simply approach the receptionist and tell her in a very bold and Volkoffian way, you are here to see Vivian.
she'll lead us to your private elevator.
once inside the elevator, I'll slip into the air shaft, go to the lab.
I can't do it. - No, you have to do it.
no, I'm not this man, I'm a scientist. Your plan is not going to work, Charles.
listen to me, it will work. My plans always work, I promise.
but you're not the spy you used to be and I'm not the villain I used to be.
we can't do this. - Damn it, we can.
if we work together, we can. What is it, what is going on?
what if she's up there?
my daughter.
this is about Vivian? - I don't know her.
W What do you say to a daughter you've never even met?
I'm so sorry I've ruined your life"?
no, no. I'm sorry, I can't see her.
I'm gonna run away now. - No, Hart wait!
can I help you?
my name is Charles Car Chuck Bartowski, and I'm here to see Vivian Volkoff.
and what is this in regard to?
she wants to kill me.
I don't believe it.
I'm impressed.
walking into my office unarmed bold... stupid but bold.
Sarah is still alive.
how can that be?
it doesn't matter.
what matters is that I need a vial of the antidote iridium 6.
your father stored it here and I need it.
you need it. - Please, I'm pleading with you.
I am here to plead for Sarah's life.
what's the trick, Chuck?
what's the clever plan that gets you out of this?
I'm all out of plans.
the woman that I love is dying and all I can do is hope that you haven't totally become this person.
everything that you have ever said was done to manipulate me.
you told me my father was a monster and now you tell me he's someone else, some sort of hero?
I wouldn't say hero.
bloody fool, more like.
I signed on for a mission simply 'cause they needed a scientist, and then I convinced his father, my friend Stephen, to let me use his computer program to help me.
how did you get in here?
Oh, I just asked to be shown to my office.
everyone was really nice. They, they all jumped up to help me.
I guess I must have been a harsh boss.
and father.
I'm so sorry.
you're sorry?
this was my grandmother's. Her name was Vivian.
she rode horses...
and she looked just like you.
don't you see, Vivian?
you're a good person and you come from a good family.
you've fallen into the wrong world, the wrong life, but this isn't you.
you're not a killer.
I killed Sarah in cold blood.
but you haven't, you haven't yet, there's still time.
you can give me the antidote and I can save her.
no. I have to be Volkoff now!
I am this building, I am this company. I can never leave, I can never go back.
what if you could?
how?
these are blank identities.
they're very rare and they're very clean.
you'd have to give up Volkoff Industries, but if you take these, you can start over anywhere in the world, both of you.
but Charles...
H how are you going to escape? - It doesn't matter, okay?
the only thing that matters is saving Sarah at this point.
Vivian, I don't know you, but I'd like to.
if you pull that trigger...
you'll lose yourself forever like I did.
you can still change.
please, I need your help.
my brother is cutting it close.
whole place is surrounded by Decker's men.
Chuck's never going to be able to get in there.
no, he'll have a plan. Chuck will come up with something.
what the hell?
sorry we're late, Morgan.
egypt took longer than we thought.
not a problem, ladies, thank you for coming.
I called Sarah's bridesmaids as soon as their plane landed.
don't give me any grief, Casey, we're here for Sarah.
glad you're here.
meet Mary the mother in law. - Hi.
we have a signal.
man Repeat that. What did you say?
something's approaching by air.
I have the antidote. Let me in.
get him out of here.
Hey! Decker, let him in!
thanks for coming, guys. - You're welcome, Chuck.
Hey, let him in, douche.
you're all under arrest.
kind of disappointed in you, Bartowski.
you thought you could get past me with a few of your spy friends?
I know the move...
but we have a move of our own. It's called the magnet.
see, while you're busy looking at me and all of my spy friends, you're missing something really, really big, care of Volkoff Industries.
Russians, so many Russians.
russian special forces.
you really are a traitor. - Just for the day.
this is a file that contains all of Project X, the cover up, and your involvement in all of it.
if anything happens to Sarah or my friends or family, this story hits the front page of every paper in the United States.
you're done. - I quit. Now get out of my way.
I do.
I do.
Sarah. Baby.
when we do it for real, we'll be ready.
I think we left out one pretty important little detail.
it's not too late. It's not too late. It's not too late.
please. Please. Please.
first church of saints funeral and viewing 3pm bartowski wedding 4pm
right, my vows.
my turn for that.
they just don't cut it. I'm sorry, Sarah.
how do I express the depth of my love for you?
or my dreams for our future?
or the fact that I will fight for you every day?
or that our kids will be like little superheroes with little capes and stuff like that?
words can't express that. They don't do it justice. They just don't cut it.
so no vows.
I'll just prove it to you every day for the rest of our lives.
you can count on me.
perfect.
do you, um, Charles Bartowski...
take this woman to be your, uh...
lawfully wedded wife?
I do.
and do you take this man... - I do.
okay. Well, by the power vested in me by the Intergalactic Federation of Planets...
I now pronounce you man and wife.
you may kiss the bride.
come here.
trust me, Chuck.
you and I we're perfect for each other, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you away from everyone else and away from the spotlight.
I love you.
I love you, Chuck.
and nothing's ever gonna change that.
I feel like I should be James Bond right now.
you know, like the guy who's standing on this balcony with you right now in this moment.
I mean, he... - I didn't fall in love with James Bond.
I fell in love with you.
welcome to the family.
to the airport, my good man!
Morgan, what happened to the driver?
Oh, no. I was always the driver, Chuck.
having a little trouble letting go, I suppose.
just roll up the partition, would you, buddy?
as you wish.
as you wish!
Mrs. Chuck Bartowski. - Mr. Sarah Walker.
this is Chuck Bartowski, happily married man. What do you want, Morgan?
Charles, sorry we missed the party, but we did send a little gift in our place.
did you get it? - Hartley.
what are you talking about? - Look under your seat.
wise with it, Charles. Good luck.
what?
Oh, boy.
two weeks later
Hey, guys.
well, well. The prodigal son returns.
from my honeymoon.
go ahead, chump. Whistle past the graveyard.
the deal went through. The Buy More's been sold.
give it a week. I guarantee we'll all be jobless.
leave us alone, please? Private conversation.
well, maybe just give it a little time, fellas.
get the hell back to work!
the new owner might stop by today.
I am working.
guess it's the dawn of a new chapter, eh, boy?
I'd watch that boy talk, redneck. - From General Beckman.
your personal effects.
wouldn't want you to be without your pocket protector.
Yeah, well, I'd rather wear this than be in business with you.
you really think you've been fighting evil, hmm? Doing good?
you're just a pawn. You always were.
what are you talking about?
you think it was all a coincidence?
the Intersect, FULCRUM, the Ring, Shaw, Agent X?
that's all just part of the plan, Bartowski.
pieces on the puzzle board.
see you never, civilian.
wait, wait, wait. What plan?
what plan?
my life was changed forever. My friends were put in danger. My family...
my father was killed, Decker.
a plan? Sounds more like a conspiracy.
question is, who could control our lives so well? - I don't know. We've been racking our brains.
Ah, it doesn't matter anyway. It's not our fight.
you forget the CIA fired our asses.
okay, well, what if we went into business for ourselves?
and how exactly would we do that?
well, we have a base, and the Buy More has proven to be an excellent cover.
Yeah. We know.
we bought it.
Hartley turned over all of Volkoff's assets to us. Wedding present.
877... million dollars.
although I like to refer to it as a cool billion, just 'cause it's kind of more fun to say.
mamacita, that's a lot of money.
and who better to handle a billion dollars than me?
us. Us. Us!
our first purchase was the Buy More and everything below it.
now we have all of Volkoff's resources at our disposal.
that's if you guys still want to take out some bad guys.
damn right we do. - Damn right we do.
you guys want a job?
hell, yeah. - Hells, yeah.
great! I took the liberty of buying us a Gulf Stream and all new tactical equipment.
we do have to reoutfit Castle, though, so, any ideas?
freelance spies. Yes! Men... and women of action and adventure.
under the radar, above the law. Oh, man, this is gonna be so much fun.
just, uh, huh.
Oh, nice. Slick new gig. Slick new shades.
what could go wrong?
Morgan, did you just...
guys... I know kung fu.
hi I'm Chuck.
here are a few things that you might need to know.
you really think you've been fighting evil...
doing good?
you think it was all a coincidence?
the Intersect, Fulcrum, the Ring, Shaw, Agent X?
you're just a pawn, you always were.
no, no, n-n-n-no, don't take the Intersect.
you're fired, Chuck. - No!
operation Bartowski is done.
what if we went into business for ourselves?
Hartley turned over all of Volkoff's assets to us.
our first purchase was the Buy More and everything below it.
freelance spies. Under the radar, above the law.
Oh, man, this is gonna be so much fun.
nice.
guys...
I know kung Fu.
So...ocean view, gulls flying by?
think this is something you could get used to?
well, I-I think I'm more of a toes-in-the-sand kind of girl.
I like the idea of waking up in the morning and rolling out onto the beach.
okay, well, then maybe we can find a nice little place on the sand someday if we, you know...
survive this? - Yeah.
Hi.
how you doing today?
no shooting.
I don't want the blood and the mess on the pool deck.
make them jump.
think we can survive this?
I don't think so, honey.
honey?
you talk like an old married couple.
well, actually...
no, no, I'm sorry, I don't care.
throw them off the cliff.
do it and die, Jean Claude.
we just came for the vase. It belongs to our client.
you let us have it and maybe we'll let you live.
you've fallen into our trap.
you see, we work with a master spy, somebody who you can't see coming.
in fact, right now, he's probably...
I want it noted that I took out six of their guys.
he was taking this.
you thieves have expensive tastes.
this vase is worth $6 million.
it's times like these, I wish I still had the Intersect.
well, you don't. What now, Moriarty?
kill them.
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait wait!
we have another master spy.
okay, yes, yes, first mission as the Intersect.
you can do this.
they need you, Morgan, so get in there, okay, and you be a man.
no, be more than a man.
start with the man part, just be a man first.
keep going, thief, this is fun.
well, the fun's about to end, Jean Claude, because while we've been standing around chatting, our other master spy has been effortlessly breaching your compound's security.
I'm good, I'm good.
he's heartless, cruel...
I'm so sorry, fishies, about your pond.
you think your security men are the best, top-notch?
I admit I do.
well, our spy is currently slicing through them like a hot knife through butter.
go on, say something about you-know-who.
do I have to? - Yes.
he'll tear your limbs off and beat you with them.
okay, okay.
points for trying, but where is this master spy?
you are looking for me?
right here, tough guy.
okay, here we go. Here we go.
kill him, too. Kill them all.
come on.
now's the time, buddy.
I'm working on it, working on it.
And...we're dead.
let's dance.
who the hell are you?
Charles Carmichael of Carmichael Industries, private contractors, spies for hire.
don't forget it.
wow, I really thought that the latch was latched, but, uh...
buff that right out. I think we can, we can still make that-- we'll make that work.
we're still working out the kinks.
all righty, folks, it wasn't a total catastrophe.
the client was not interested in the vase but the microchip inside it, and that is intact.
boom.
sir? or.
bang, we are in the pink.
the vase was going to be our payment.
and...
still is, fully restored.
who's not going to pay six mil for a slightly used Ming vase?
Chuck, we mowed through the Volkoff fortune on start-up costs.
I mean, look at these numbers.
$42 million, which is still a lot of dough.
rockets, bullets, the private jet, servicing the private jet, the fresh shrimp that Morgan likes to eat on the private jet.
you have to understand they're just not the same frozen.
they're expensive, and if we're going to stay solvent, then we need to collect soon.
or crawl back to Beckman, get a government contract.
never had a problem with Uncle Sam.
beat the yahoos we got coming in here.
Casey, our problem is not with Uncle Sam, it's with Clyde Decker, and I don't see that changing anytime soon.
beg, plead.
you know I get antsy taking cases with moral ambiguity.
guys come on.
Sarah isn't this what we wanted?
come on, Carmichael Industries
the independence and freedom to do what we want when we want, and we're doing good, we're doing good.
we got a solid team.
we just need a little more time to get our feet on solid ground.
and, in the meantime, we work for dirtbags.
Chuck, you're handling this really well.
I mean, all the bumps in the road and Morgan with the Intersect and you without it.
which is fine.
Morgan, yes, has the Intersect now, but I'm, I'm happy for him.
Plus, I get to work with my smokin' hot wife and my best friends.
who could ask for anything more?
what was that? - What was what?
are you hiding something?
why would I need to hide anything?
okay. - Okay.
Morgan, Operation VFTB is dead.
view from the Bluff" is dead?
Chuck, I found the perfect house for you guys.
well, except that I was wrong and Sarah doesn't want a house on the bluff.
she wants her toes in the sand.
okay, fine, "Operation Toes in the Sand.
toes in the Sa-- T. I. T...Why don't, why don't, why don't we just call it "Operation Toes," okay?
fine, fine, I'll start my research.
Chuck, I know you've been setting aside funds for this house, you know, and I hope my accident with the vase didn't, didn't blow it for you.
no, hey, hey, don't worry about it.
we've got a very promising potential client.
we're going to wine and dine him and, soon enough, we will be raking it in.
good, and you know what? If it all goes south, - well, we still have... - The Buy More.
she's served us well over the years.
it all seems so normal, a little too normal.
Yeah. Sleeping dogs, though; sleeping dogs.
it's Casey. Wants us down in Castle.
hoist the flag.
Hey, Casey, what do you need?
the client's here. I don't like him.
what?
the who, the what? The client-- the client is here?
I thought we were going to wine and dine the guy, charm him.
waste of time-- he's here now.
Casey, this is supposed to be a secret base.
I took precautions.
good.
Casey, what precautions?
what the hell kind of operation is this?
we're still working out the kinks.
$20 million was stolen from me by a high-level Ponzi Schemer.
you heard the name Roger Bale?
well, you will soon.
he's bilked investors to the tune of about a half a billion dollar.
why not go to the cops?
I did, but Bale has falsified records, saying he lost the money in normal trading and he's broke, but he keeps buying property in St. Martin. He's a thief.
the heart of Bale's operation is a computer vault in his corporate headquarters.
access the accounts, get my money.
Yes, we ride at midnight.
his security is deadly.
so maybe, maybe we, we ride first thing in the morning.
- That's probably a better idea.
twenty percent of what you recover is yours.
done some digging on you, Woodley.
you're just an ambulance chaser, trial lawyer, scum of the earth.
he's kidding. He's kidding. He's only kidding.
Casey, Bale is worth infiltrating anyway.
looks like he's stolen money from teachers' unions and families.
tell me everything you know about this animal.
and everything goes through his secure Blackberry.
what a complete tool.
Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah on the Bluetooth, all day-- how rude.
I'm getting a really good feed from the satellite.
the party's being set up, and the place looks like a fortress.
see? I told you satellite was a good investment.
we just got to figure out a way to get into his PDA and invite ourselves to this party.
let's talk house, homeboy.
what was that? Did you say house?
nothing, n-nothing, Sarah. Just hopping off real quick.
the house is secret, remember?
the only secret, the only real secret is gonna be which room you're sleeping in.
Why? 17 of 'em!
swimming pool, screening room, bowling alley, gourmet kitchen, second...
bowling alley, and it's on the beach.
I mean, it's crazy, but...
toes in the sand. - Toes in the sand.
toes in... - Toes in the sand!
could you imagine how awesome this would be, buddy?
I mean, to give Sarah the dream life?
owning her own company, living in the dream home, a place that we can call our own.
we just need this gig to pay out.
I know.
Chuck, why don't we just nab this guy's phone while he's playing squash?
I just zoomed on his gym bag. Okay?
Kensington Athletic. It's, like a super exclusive squash club.
he's got to have a regular game, right?
Morgan, that's fantastic.
fantastic!
Zoomed? Did you say you...
what? Did you...you said you zoomed on his gym bag?
Yes, yeah, because you had "flash," which was great, but...
I kind of want to do my own thing, mix it up a little bit, so I came up with zoom.
you don't like it. you don't like it.
no, hey, hey-- "zoom" it is, buddy. You know.
whatever you want. - Really?
you're-you're amazing. You are so Zen right now.
if I had a power like that and I thought it was gone forever,
Chuck, I'd be a wreck.
but not you, man, you are my hero.
you're great even without the Intersect.
how certain are you that these glasses only had one reload left in them?
Like...very certain.
I tried to access the program, but there was no way to update it.
this version of the Intersect is a one-time deal-- I'm sorry.
that's okay. That's okay.
Morgan's got it now, and he's doing surprisingly well, so...
Chuck, what's wrong?
the Intersect opened me up to big dreams.
but in order for those dreams to become a reality,
I need this business to succeed, and...
you think the company doesn't work if you don't have the Intersect?
Yeah.
Chuck, I don't think that Dad wanted you to have the Intersect forever.
and besides, you don't need it.
the computer didn't make you a hero, it just gave you an opportunity to become one.
now it's up to you.
the training wheels are off, you're gonna fall down, but I promise you...you can do this.
my two cents.
Thanks, sis.
I needed a good Ellie speech.
well, what are sisters for?
the mission, is to access Roger Bale's PDA and put ourselves on the guest list for his party tonight.
the phone is gonna be difficult to get to, and password-protected when we do.
if...Bale has bodyguards; could be trouble.
this plug-in will cut through all the encryption and install a virus that will send me an invite.
bale is playing in a club squash tournament.
Morgan, you're gonna delay his opponent while I step in and match up with Bale.
he'll get to know my face and name so that when I show up at the party, I won't be a complete stranger.
what? What-what-what, what's the problem? What's up?
you're gonna play?
do you actually play any non-video game sports?
Yeah, I played some racquetball.
I think I can fake squash for half an hour.
no, Chuck, I don't think so.
I... Sarah.
well, sweetheart, um...
you know, I-I think what, um...
let's put Grimes on the court.
he can zoom on squash, give the guy a game.
zoom, Casey? - It'll buy me some time.
you delay his opponent, take over the job I was gonna do. It'll be great, right?
what was the job I was gonna do?
yeah...
I think I'm supposed to be playing my game right now.
you sure it's only 2: 00?
Mr. Burnham, you just sit here and relax.
I will tell you when it's time. And right now, it is...
not time.
Bale's coming.
Casey, he's headed your way.
Morgan, get ready, he'll be there in a minute.
Yep.
Chuck, you keep that bear on that table, or this all falls apart.
remember, I like it deep...and hard.
that's great. That just sounds great.
Hey, man, sorry for the delay.
I had a hot tub full of nursing students.
they're so chatty. - Totally.
so, you must be Killer Burnham?
he's a no-show.
I'm Michael Carmichael of Michael Carmichael Industries, a subsidiary of MikeCo.
that sounds like big money.
you have no idea. You know, if was standing on my wallet...
I'd be tall. - Yeah.
your skin is...soft to the touch.
there you go. - Is that a waxing situation?
my wife's talked to me about waxing, but...
I'm not really a big fan of physical contact.
outside of my job, of course.
this is what I do every day.
Hey, uh, your ball warm?
here we go
amigo, my ball is...red-hot.
you're pretty quick.
sneaky quick," they call that.
put a little elbow grease into it.
Oh, yeah? Should I do that?
there you go. - There it is.
almost there.
almost there.
little deeper. - You know...
you are a thick man.
Yeah...right there. - There it is.
come on.
turn and reach, you old son of a bitch.
Hey, Chuck, we got a problem.
Casey's caught up getting Bale's phone.
maybe I can tranq my guy and give Casey an assist.
so, let me ask you a question.
this guy you're supposed to play, Jim Burnham, you called him something else.
killer.
heard he killed nine men in the Foreign Legion.
the name stuck.
only nine, huh?
what the hell?
no, no, somebody's not relaxing! Relax, breathe, breathe.
I just dropped something. Oil's slippery.
John Casey. I knew you'd fall for that old line.
I haven't seen you since jump school.
stark. Been a while.
breathe. - Is that a gun?
I am gonna rip your head off!
what's a leatherneck like you doing in the Kensington Club?
private security. - Me, too.
for a turd named Bale.
I don't have to sell you on selling out.
guy with your skills, Casey, you've got to be raking it in.
you think one little dart is gonna drop 400 pounds of solid meat?
you seem like a...
moderately successful individual.
let's say a fella had 40 mil just kind of lying around doing nothing.
what would you do with it?
you looking to invest?
I might be. I might be.
No!
good game, Carmichael.
Oh, bunny doll, bunny doll, Bale; Bale, bunny doll.
Hey, uh, why don't you guys come to my party tomorrow night?
tomorrow night? Bunny doll, do we have anything, uh, planned?
no. I don't think so.
well, how do you feel? You want to go?
Oh, I'm game.
good, good, good, good, good.
it's a date, then, huh? - Tomorrow night.
quit goofing around, Chuck. We gotta go.
what about the mission?
don't worry, Morgan saved the day.
got an invite to the party.
thank God for the Intersect, huh?
Hey, buddy. Nice work on the mish today.
Yes.
so listen, we wired a couple million dollars into Bale's account.
you're all set for the party.
would you go Bogart with the white tux, or would you go Bond with the black tux?
black, definitely.
I knew it. I knew black tux.
always bet on black. Right?
okay, what's wrong?
Chuck, is this Intersect withdrawal?
I mean, are you...are you missing it?
sure. Yeah. Of course, but it's-it's more than that.
I'm just realizing how hard it's going to be without it.
I guess I got used to our spy missions being a little bit easier.
but-but remember the big picture here.
your beautiful wife, your perfect home.
it's all right here, buddy.
toes in the sand.
it's the-the big picture.
I gotta go. I'll get this to the lab.
good job, team. - Yeah.
right, a high five here. - Good, good, good, good.
good briefing.
Chuck, do you realize that I am a trained spy who can tell when somebody is keeping a secret?
especially when that someone happens to be my husband?
it's who I am. Husband without a secret.
Casey and I are going to scout Bale's corporate headquarters, so we'll talk about this later.
can't this be that one-time conversation?
save Jeff Barnes!
this isn't good.
we finally lost control of the store, haven't we?
all right, where's Jeff?
No...Where's Lester?
I can sense his evil little hand all over this.
heartbreaking, isn't it?
what happened? - What do you mean?
is this about poor Jeffrey over there?
poor Jeffrey? - Poor Jeffrey?
he was trampled by a stampede of middle-aged secretaries during the midnight release of the talking Justin Bieber doll.
his legs were crushed.
he may never walk again.
shame!
shame.
Morgan, I can't believe it.
it's terrible. I feel so bad!
no, Morgan, I mean, I literally can't believe it.
Really? This? They wouldn't. They couldn't.
what am I talking about? It's Jeff and Lester. Of course, it's a scam.
please help. Buy More insurance ran out.
the audacity. As the secret owner of this establishment,
I happen to know we have excellent insurance.
listen, how are we going to prove that Jeff and Lester are bilking it from the store?
well, maybe we construct some sort of ruse, you know, and trick him up out of the chair.
or we could...Hang on.
or we could wait for him to stand up like the moron that he is.
Yeah.
Mr. Barnes, this is some sort of insurance scam?!
Hey, guys.
Jeff, you're gonna give back every penny, or you're going to jail.
to see my mom?
Hey, guys, guys, what are you doing?
this is a very sick man here.
Ah, my gosh! Jeffrey, you can walk!
guys, it's a miracle. It's a miracle.
this is because of your donations.
shame.
shame. - Shame.
I think we may need to spend some more time at the Buy More.
Yeah, we do.
I forgot-- Sarah wants to have a talk.
she knows I'm keeping a secret from her.
Oh, no. Not the house.
she's gonna try and break me.
okay, I'm gonna hold on to this, right?
and, uh, you go in there, and you be strong. Good luck.
remember, I'm not there to save you this time.
Sarah? - In a minute!
so, honey, here's the thing.
I'm not trying to keep anything from you.
you are my wife, and-and that's a part of the deal.
I'm well aware of that.
I would, however, like to keep a few things in a special category of "you don't need to know aboutness.
no, no. Not today.
this has worked in the past. Not today.
what is it?
this. This. All that.
what's your secret, Chuck?
my lips are sealed.
well, let me help you unseal them.
hand it over.
he cracked like an egg.
it's an acronym. You see the little dots there?
whatever.
if you were to break it up and sound it out phonetically...
it's very sweet, Chuck, that you tried to surprise me.
with a dream home.
like that one right there, right on the sand.
the perfect house for the perfect woman. What do you think?
it's not right, is it?
you know, I-I could just keep playing detective and trying to read your mind...
well, I haven't, um...
well, this isn't something that I've ever told anybody.
hello. Husband.
it's my official title now. I have a ring to prove it.
you tell me things that you don't tell other people.
well, when I was a little girl, my, uh...my dad's "work" kept us moving around a lot.
and I always imagined what a real family would feel like, you know, what the perfect home for us all would be, and, you know, the dream house. This is stupid.
no, no, it's not. Babe continue.
well, I always imagined a little white house with a red door and, don't laugh, but it had a picket fence, just like, you know, the houses that you see on TV that people live in.
mid-century, very Leave It to Beaver?
cozy, homey and simple.
and perfect.
Really?
Sarah, I'm going to find you your dream home, whatever it takes. I'll do anything. I promise.
testing, one, two.
looking good, team.
especially you, Sarah.
well, let's have a great mission, huh, team?
while I sit by myself in the van.
God, I hope this works.
all right. Let's go over the plan, one more time.
Casey, you locate Bale's computer vault.
morgan and Sarah, you're gonna create a distraction, giving Casey enough time to get into the vault and tap into the system.
got it.
bale, old man, good to see you.
nice to see you. - Right?
Yeah, you remember Sarah? - I do.
this is Chalmers, my mute manservant.
we have received your wire and account information.
on behalf of our investors, we're very excited to have you aboard.
I bet. I bet. - Follow me.
will do.
I was to be your accountant.
what I did was, I improvised. Okay.
Morgan, buddy, you're doing great. You're doing great.
just stay on point. Remember the mission. Casey, you're up.
excellent. Excellent, Casey. Excellent.
fiber optic cable leads all the way down that hall.
that's probably where the vault is.
I'll need a key card.
Sarah? - I'm on it.
as you can see, my fortune is based on shared wealth.
finding others who enjoy the better things in life.
Yeah, that's very bold, Mr. Bale.
Chuck...this jerk's starting to get handsy with my girl.
our girl. Your girl.
calm. Calm, Morgan! Just calm down.
no. No, no, no, no, no, no. I think I'm gonna zoom, okay?
I can feel it coming on-- a little kung Fu.
I am gonna karate chop this guy in the face.
no, no, no, no. Do not do that.
you're gonna zoom too soon.
premature zoom? Really? Crap!
okay, okay, what do I do?
think about baseball.
baseball. Why baseball? I mean, come on. It is so boring.
I mean, just pitch the damn ball already!
and enough talk with the statistics!
Chuck, do you know what a slugging percentage is?
cause I don't know what a slugging percentage is, all right?
and honestly, who the hell cares?!
all right, that worked. Thank you, buddy.
thank you. I'm good.
perhaps I can show you around the gardens outside.
they are modeled after the pleasure gardens of Italy.
well, the pleasure would be all mine.
you're a good girl.
what a slime bag.
excellent work, everybody.
Casey is on his way to the computer vault.
Morgan, Sarah, distraction time.
all right, Chuck. Am I up?
you are up, buddy. Zoom away.
I like that.
let me show you how it's done.
nice work, Morgan.
we're in. - Bingo.
now, once all the accounts are downloaded, we can reroute them to the original investors.
no, no, no, no, no, no, no. What's happening?
Hello, Chuck.
what are you doing?
I'm using your computer to access Bale's accounts and freeze them.
no. No, no, no, no, no. You're gonna trigger the alarm.
my people are still inside.
you people? Cute.
listen, I know you lied to me, I know I'm not part of your bigger plan, whatever the hell that is, okay?
you've won. Now let us go.
payback's a bitch, Charlie.
guys, guys, get out of there!
Mr. Carmichael?
darling, I know what you did with my key card.
come with me now, or I will kill you in front of all of my friends.
I think actually what's gonna happen is,
I'm gonna open up a big can of
come with me, Colonel. I'm sorry.
you used to be a colonel.
Morgan, Sarah, Casey, please, tell me what's happening.
access Denied
I'm locked out of the accounts! What have you done?
do anything to us, and you'll never have access to those accounts ever again.
you see, we work with somebody.
a master spy who always has a plan.
okay. Okay, this isn't good. No plan, no plan.
the master spy does not have a plan.
I don't want to hear her voice anymore.
take 'em all downstairs. I'll decide what to do with them later.
I need you to get somebody from our computer team on the phone right now!
Yes, sir.
I think I have a plan.
computer emergency?
what's wrong with it?
an outside computer is accessing your system.
you're under attack. Don't worry.
I cut into the attack, and your accounts are still here.
is it fixed? - Yeppers.
get rid of him. - Huh?
wait, wait, wait, wait. What's happening? I'm just the IT guy.
you saw some things you weren't supposed to see.
and I don't like your face. Kill him.
then the others.
I'd think twice about that, Bale!
I pull these wires, your firewall goes down, and the CIA is inside of you in seconds.
your computer. Inside of your computer in seconds.
who are you?
I have your brother Michael.
I know, and you're gonna let him and the others go.
I so much as sneeze, and, well, you lose all your money.
that was about ten million bucks right there, Rog.
let 'em go.
what the hell is going on?
you're free to go.
Hey, Chuck? Chuck, can you hear me? Where are you?
Sarah, you outside?
Yeah. They let us go. Are you still inside?
don't worry about me. Just go.
no, I'm-I'm not going anywhere.
Sarah, you, Casey and Morgan, get in the van and leave right now.
did I do great? - Shut up, moron.
Chuck, I am not leaving my husband on a mission.
Sarah...Sarah, I'm sorry.
I wanted to buy you the house.
I wanted to give you the future that you've always dreamed of.
but more than that, I want you to live.
don't make me die in vain.
leave me behind. Get in the van.
leave. Leave me behind!
Casey, we can't just leave him behind like that.
please, leave!
press Play
guys, please don't leave me behind! I have a plan.
your friends are safe, but you're stuck here.
what were you thinking?
actually, I was thinking fast.
listen, there's-there's a button on the control panel.
hit that button.
this Button
I just hope they got my message.
Morgan, disconnect us from the building's electrical line.
Casey, get the van moving.
Sarah, there's a rather large window on the east side of the building.
it's the only way out...
so I'm going to be jumping through it.
Casey, east side of the building-- go, go, go, go!
and Sarah, no matter what happens, I love you.
good work, Chuck! - Thanks, honey.
Hey, dude, that was awesome!
listen, guys, team, let's-let's...let's not get down, okay?
Yes, that was not a classically successful mission, but, you know, we all made it out alive, uh, so-so, that-that's a plus.
and the news says that Bale was arrested, so, I think we should put that in the win category.
win, uh, win with an asterisk maybe.
it's not that, Chuck.
well, okay, what is it then?
decker froze Bale's accounts, which included the money we transferred in.
castle and the Buy More are the only things that aren't frozen.
decker froze all of our money because he tracked our deposit back to us.
wait.
wait. What? All our...all our money?
we have nothing? - Payback's a bitch.
okay, think about it. We still have the Buy More, and-and we still have me. And, uh, Sarah and Casey, you.
this is still a team. We can still do this.
I think I, uh...I think I need a little air.
listen, it's okay. We'll bounce back. We always do.
Yeah.
I got to...
I'll be back.
Chuck, you found it.
what's the matter?
I can't afford it.
if I bought it yesterday with our fortune, we'd own it, but now...
I'm so sorry, Sarah.
well, so what? I mean, we knew this wasn't gonna be easy, and we didn't get married because we thought life was easy.
we got married so that we could be there for each other when things got tough.
so we could work through things together, rich or poor.
but how are we going to do this?
I mean, we got to start over.
it's okay. We'll get new clients and new missions.
and we haven't lost everything. We still have Castle and the store.
the Buy More.
the Buy More.
the Buy More.
we use the store to support the spy team.
we take Buy Mores' profits, put them into Carmichael Industries until both companies can make money.
but in order for that to work, the store actually has to turn a profit.
we can do that. - We can do that.
what about me, though?
Morgan's the Intersect.
who am I? What's my job?
Chuck, you're our leader.
that's the plan.
as you can see, our superiors' interference in Chuck Bartowski's life has only just begun.
now you understand how important he is.
and why he must fail.
you all have your orders.
this is the plan. Its final chapter.
nothing can stop it.
ever here of carbon monoxide?
stop sleeping in your van, Jeff.
I'm seeing things clearly for the first time in a long time.
are you high?
Morgan, the Intersect that you uploaded, there's something wrong with it.
there was some kind of Trojan horse hidden in the software.
that's why you're not acting like yourself!
you've text-messaged a breakup with my little girl?
I can do better.
morgan told anyone who wanted to hear he had the Intersect.
decker wants Morgan dead.
stop!
Chuck, what the hell, man?!
Morgan, you stay away from douche-cycle, okay?
we've gotta get you back to Castle now.
the CIA knows you're the Intersect. You have a hit out on you!
Yeah. Oh, my God. Yeah-yeah-yeah. Let's go Let's go. Don't freak out, though, okay?
I am still the Intersect.
not to mention I happen to stand by my Montracer's coolness factor. Please, okay?
I'm just gonna grab some... - No, no!
Yes, I agree that it is okay to freak out. - Thank you.
Morgan, the only reason there's a hit on you is because you got the Intersect in your head.
so we just need to get it out of your head, let the CIA know it's over, and you'll be safe.
and a moron again.
sorry. Moron still.
okay, all right, how do we start that? Is Ellie working on something?
no, we, uh... called in the big guns.
so shocked you people are running out of money.
missile Command is a part of our process.
all right, let's clean up this mess.
are you ready, Mr. Grimes?
Yes, ma'am. Let's do it.
let's get this mind-melting, assassination-producing thing out of my head.
don't worry, buddy, just so sit back, relax, breathe.
so that's it? It's, it's really over? Superhero no more?
okay, all right, if you're absolutely sure this is the only way.
Morgan, look, trust me, I know how you feel, I do, okay?
the Intersect is a lot of fun. But this is all for the best.
I know. I know. I do.
can I just do one last thing first?
you ready, buddy? - Ready.
man, I miss the Intersect.
okay, let's do this.
Bye, Captain Morgan.
okay, okay, wow, yeah, yeah.
you all right? - Fine. Yeah, great.
that was for dumping Alex.
I get it! I get it!
and the first thing I'm gonna do is apologize to her, okay?
but do I need to remind you that my mind was melted?
how's your memory, buddy? You remember Die Hard, Star Wars, Chewie, Yoda, "Yippie Ki-Yay"?
sorry, dude, no, it all kinda sounds like gibberish. - It is.
well, I feel fine otherwise, you know?
I guess my brain just got rid of the unimportant stuff.
which there seemed to be plenty of.
general, how long will it take to call the hit off?
I'll contact you when he's clear.
until then, Grimes, stay down here.
and the rest of you, don't make a mistake like this again.
thank you, General.
stop playing with government toys. You have plenty of your own.
and we lower the babies to our chests as we breathe in...
and blow it out as we raise 'em back up.
in... out...
in... out...
Oh, hey, guys! Grab a mat, join baby yoga. We can share Clara.
we'd love to, but we're kind of in a rush.
Hey, baby Clara! How's my favorite niece in the world?
Clara is a rad yogi. You know, I probably shouldn't say this, but she's a way more grounded breather than these other jokers.
well, looks like you're really enjoying paternity leave.
I have adjusted 100%. I could do this forever.
let's go ahead and put our babies into a teeny downward puppy.
Hey, there's Superdad's missus.
uh, yes, Devon is really taking to the stay-at-home daddy thing.
he's gotten into mommy groups that wouldn't even call me back.
well, you're lucky he's willing to stay at home.
Yeah, yeah, I'm a happy lady.
well, happy lady, have a great day at work. - Thanks.
have a good one. Bye, Clara.
Say,"Bye, Mommy. - bye .
man, how great are Ellie and Awesome, huh?
they're just a nice, happy, normal couple.
Yeah, they are. - We aren't all that normal, are we?
no, no, not really, but we're happy and we're nice.
it's just, you know, my best friend is being hunted; his brain almost turned to mush.
I haven't slept in nearly a week because our family business is is on the brink of bankruptcy.
and we're spies who aren't allowed in the CIA.
I just, I just think you know, maybe we're at a fork in the road.
well, you want, you want to not be spying?
I just wonder what it'd be like to be a normal married couple.
regular 9: 00 to 5: 00's, more taco nights, less evil cabals?
look, I know things have been a little crazy right now, but Morgan's gonna be fine, and we're gonna figure out this whole free-agent spy thing.
even now that we don't have the Intersect?
Yes, even now.
here we go. Here we go.
Oh, no.
most of the assassins have been called off.
most of the assassins? Okay, good.
that's like getting "most" of the brain tumor.
I don't understand what the problem is, General.
the problem's name is Decker. - That's right.
the order originally came from his desk.
he's already ousted us from the Agency. What's his problem?
he's not done with us. - Perhaps we should...
good afternoon.
I hear we're having the most unfortunate little kill order mix-up.
don't you ever interrupt my feed again, Decker.
I am still your superior.
decker, what's going on? Morgan is Intersect-free. Call off this hit.
Oh, I really do want to.
but unfortunately, and probably not accidentally,
I also sent the order out to one outside contractor.
one who can't be recalled. It's sort of his "thing.
it's, uh, codename "Viper.
the Viper?! He goes completely dark once he's cashed the check.
which, sadly, he's done.
what does he know?
just the name Morgan Grimes. That should do it.
that's all he needs. The Viper's never had an uncompleted mission.
why don't I leave you all with a little look-see at some of his famous kills?
so many dead people.
I'm gonna be down here for the rest of my life.
and I have all these broken relationships I need to fix upstairs.
don't worry, buddy. Your name's not gonna be on that list.
no way. We're on it.
Yeah, leave it to the three friends you recently stabbed in the back.
okay, marked for death. It's kinda sexy.
it's not terrifying. Why?
cause my big bad spy friends are gonna take care of it.
that's right, buddy, nothing to worry about.
all we have to do is lure out this Viper creature and neutralize him.
look, there's no reason why we can't reason with him.
you know, the man's just doing a job. There's no vendetta involved.
maybe we can talk to him, contractor to contractor.
like normal people.
Oh, man!
Jeffrey, you're not noticing I'm doing something interesting here, buddy?
Oh, sorry. What's up?
okay, so, listen, as you know, the big Salesman of the Year convention is taking place this weekend in Riverside.
but you never sell anything. You just eat Pirate's Booty and watch large - lady pornography.
I'm aware of that, but I rigged it so that every employee's sales this quarter have been logged under my name.
my friend, I'm going to be up to my eyebrows in popcorn shrimp and some sweet Inland Empire lady parts.
but what about the rest of us?
like, what if I wanted to go?
no, no, you don't. You like being number two. I made you number two, man.
I don't think I do.
you do. Stop spewing nonsense.
sometimes I think you are a bad person.
now, undo what you've done.
I know you'll feel better if you earn this on your own.
son, are you reading a book?
Yes, I am. - I'm gonna get my camera.
let the reeducation of Morgan Grimes begin.
Oh, yes, I am so excited. What do I start with?
easy. Star Wars.
I'm so jealous.
enjoy, while we sort this out.
and don't worry, the Force is strong in this one.
Ah, no idea what that means, but I'm pumped.
well, have fun. - Okay, all right.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Casey, Casey.
want to watch Star Wars with me?
no. No, but hey, don't start with A New Hope.
old ones, nobody likes that.
phantom Menace. Everybody loves Phantom Menace.
Hey, you're all right. Thanks, man. Yeah, sure.
the Phantom Menace.
Yeah, this is gonna be awesome.
I'm sorry, who is this again?
Jeffrey. Jeffrey Barnes. You know, from the Buy More.
you sound... normal.
we really need a decision on who will be chosen to go to the Buy More Salesman of the Year weekend in Riverside, and our manager cannot be located.
you know, let me, uh, let me call corporate, and I'll let you know.
great. Thanks, Chuck. - Bye.
I know how to find the Viper.
so, I've talked to corporate, and it turns out that the Salesperson of the Year and winner of the coveted weekend in Riverside, California, is...
are you pulling my considerable chain?!
Grimes has barely shown his face in weeks!
I love the boy, but it's true.
no, no, no. Guys, guys, guys! Do you not see what's happening?
this is a fix! It's obviously fixed.
now, you know what?
I revolt. I revolt! Who's with me?!
Li-Listen, I'm disappointed, too.
but aren't we all still lucky to be here?
working in a great place, in a down economy?
surrounded by our great-looking Buy More co-workers?
selling fine goods to the few people who haven't discovered Amazon.
so what if we just use this as a wake-up call and vow to work even harder for the next year?
this is... I don't know what this is, but I-I like the new work ethic, Jeff. You keep that up.
I gotta go.
so, here's the plan: We send Morgan to Riverside.
we make it as public as possible, so that the Viper hunts him down.
but before he can strike, we do.
and after all this is over, Morgan can be just a regular guy again.
okay, yeah, put myself out there, allow myself to be hunted.
now, not to sound like a baby, but without the Intersect, it does seem a bit more... terrifying.
it won't be as hard as you think.
I'm Morgan Grimes.
Oh, look at all these nice people.
wonder which one is trying to kill me.
Hello, Buy Most-ers!
and welcome to all the salespeople of the year.
now, I say "salespeople," because some of you are even ladies.
so, good for you. Another crack in that ceiling.
we're going to have to get that thing fixed.
I'm just joshing, just joshing.
grab a yard of margaritas and get your mingle on!
well, Morgan, you ready to get your mingle on?
so ready to get my mingle on. Thank you.
Casey, you good? - We're up and running.
remember, I need pulse bio-feedback.
the finger-pads don't give us lie detection unless you're actually touching the subject.
got it. Touch the subject, see if they're lying.
if they are, perhaps they want to kill Chuck.
and if they aren't, perhaps I grab another crab-puff.
okay, stay alert. All we know is that the Viper kills at close range.
that's why he's so accurate, but that only means no sniping.
he could use poison, so just watch your food and drink intake, okay?
okay, he has strangled, knifed, drowned, and there is a pool here.
so, you know?
got it. Lots of ways to die today.
okay. Once we identify the target, I'll move in and neutralize him.
Yeah, not normal husband-wife conversation.
morgan Grimes, Burbank Buy More. And where are you from?
Champaign-Urbana!
prettiest place on God's sweet earth.
that's where I was born, and, uh, where,
God willing, I will die.
Yep. He checks out.
as you know, we're all just visitors in this sweet corn festival that, uh, is life.
poor sucker thinks that's true.
well, it's nice to meet someone who loves where they're from.
and what about your friend? You're looking a little flushed there. You running a fever?
no. Always get red after my ninth or tenth.
it's true. - Irish blood, you know?
just a race to see if our noses or our hearts will explode first!
either way, though, we're dead by 50!
Yep, true, too.
you guys are too much. I'm gonna take off.
all of you shush, shush, shush, shush, shush!
Aw, man, Crazy Bob, you're killing me!
literally, this is terrible for my liver condition.
Hey, there you go.
you're the new guy; got you a special one.
drink it.
drink it now. Drink it!
please drink it. They're so loud.
Oh, he took it down! He took it...
Oh, you are welcome. Crazy Bob's shots'll kill ya.
you're a lifesaver. Good to see you.
Yep. He checks out.
Randy, come on. Leave the pretty lady alone.
I am sorry about how all these leeches are gonna paw at you all weekend.
and also wildly jealous.
Hi, I'm Linda. - Sarah.
it's very sweet of you.
so, um, seriously, how do you look like this?
ten years at Buy More, I can't keep my face out of the cheese balls.
true. The lady loves her cheese balls.
clear.
she's good, too.
clear.
true. It checks out.
clear.
all clear there, Jim. Nothing in the old eyeballs.
easy, buddy! This gets you into the buffet.
Oh, sweetie, Mama's gonna be home soon, I promise.
no, I promise, and I'm going to bring you a treat.
uh, is everything okay?
I'm just being stupid. My son has a cold, and...
I feel bad I'm here.
Oh, I... I understand.
I'm Jane. - Uh, Sarah. Sarah.
I'm here with my husband, Morgan Grimes.
Walker, move your hand. You just checked yourself.
passed, too. You're getting pretty good at this lying thing.
Oh, I promise I'm not one of those women who can't be away from her family.
it's just been a while, you know.
I think I've been a mom and a wife for so long, I...
I think I've sort of forgotten how to be a regular person, you know?
Oh, I do. I really do.
I used to know how to have fun.
I came to one of these things before I was married
crazy Bob and I led 18 people in a midnight skinny dip!
clear.
well, it sounds like you're the lady that I'm going to be sticking with.
you know everybody here.
Oh, better. I know what everyone looks like naked.
no, no! No, no, no, no!
Oh, my God.
are you okay? - I'm fine!
wait a minute. Oh, my gosh.
I have to ask you something man-to-man here, okay?
did I seriously like Phantom Menace?
because I would rather scratch out my eyeballs than to listen to that Jar Jar Binks anymore.
I don't know, maybe my brain has changed.
you know what hasn't changed?
my feelings for Alex.
Yeah, if there's one thing I remember, it's that I was an ass, an-and that I love her.
the crazy thing is, she changed her phone number.
so, just wondering maybe you can help me out?
and tell her what, that you had a secret supercomputer in your head, made you into a jackass?
no. Nothing left to say. It's over.
I lied. Start with the originals. You'd love those.
Really?
Thanks, man. Thanks.
just so you know, Darth Vader - Luke's father.
leia is his sister.
still mad.
so, all of a sudden, right, all-all of a sudden, after years and years of lunacy,
Jeff is smart, because it turns out he'd been sleeping in his van for years with the engine still running.
the guy wasn't a moron; he was actually brain-damaged.
two of our Buy Morons actually contracted scurvy.
what? Scurvy? - Yeah.
turns out they'd been subsisting solely on the candy from the snack aisle.
they didn't even know anything was wrong until they started seeing their teeth in the Jujubes.
man, the, uh, Buy More never fails to provide dinner table fodder.
my kids ask for funny customer stories every night at bed.
best job ever.
hear, hear. - Cheers. Cheers.
Oh, who needs another round? - I do. Me, me, me, me, me.
I'll come with you, honey.
I kind of love it here. - I know.
they're, like, the nicest people in the world.
Yeah, we've checked everybody, and everyone is exactly who they say they are. It's amazing.
and here we are, lying, all suspicious.
you know, I think Jane wants to be my friend. She asked me out for coffee.
she's the Viper. - What? No, no, no, no.
she passed the test. And I... I think that she just really likes me.
honey, you're right. Of course. Of course she does. Duh.
it's just my stupid suspicious spy brain, you know?
well, it doesn't matter anyway.
I mean, I'm not really sure what type of friendship is founded on lies.
but we should focus anyway. I'm sure the Viper is zeroed in on you by now.
we need to lure him out and get you alone and vulnerable.
ladies and gentlemen... ladies and gentlemen.
what, what, what? What? What?
I've had one too many, and I'm going to bed. Come on, Morgan.
no, no, no, no, no.
Hey, there's poker later, and probably another less-clothed swim party.
I would love nothing more than to see you do a naked cannonball, Irv.
keep it... keep it on, keep it on, keep it on.
I need to lie down, you know. I think the sciatica's acting up.
Yeah. I think I'll call it, too.
see you tomorrow.
Yeah, I got to call my family before they hit the hay.
Yeah, one of my kids had a big game today.
that's a lie, Chuck.
no, Omaha's no St. Louis, but we have a good time.
Sally, in her day, ooh, what a looker.
Yeah, Corn Princess in 1987.
Nope, still lying.
well, this is me.
guess I'm just going to be in here.
all by my lonesome.
well, sleep tight. Don't let the bedbugs bite.
I shouldn't have joked about bedbugs.
I mean, they cost the hospitality industry millions of dollars a year.
wrong thing to say.
Yep. I'm alone and vulnerable.
Hello, Sarah. Come in.
I've been watching you.
you've got a cute little persona going on.
but I can spot a girl in a costume.
you know, I'm not what I seem, either.
Yeah. I like costumes, too.
you're not going anywhere until you hippity-hop over here.
it's party time.
it was the bartender!
Yeah, not everybody here is normal.
Yes! I'm not going to die.
Hey, Viper. Suck it.
can I go home now?
Yeah, buddy. You're good.
we're not letting this guy go till he acknowledges the hit's been called off.
which he's being very stubborn about doing, I might add.
go ahead, nod your head. Do it.
Yep, hit's off. No more killy-killy.
this is not how it's done.
first, we have to get Decker to rescind the kill order, but we'll handle that, Morgan, so, you know, I think you're free to go.
and if you go anywhere near Alex, you're going to be on another hit list.
I'm sorry, buddy. You doing okay?
Yeah. You know, I just... wish he'd give me the number so I can explain to her.
don't give up, you know? You got to keep trying. He's a tough one to crack.
you know, uh... it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission.
truer words will never be spoken.
a stitch in time saves nine.
lead a horse to water.
just...
Hey, I... I got to make a call. Jane asked me for a drink, and this is going to take a while, so I have to...
no, no, no, no. Go. Casey and I can take care of the Viper handoff.
Really? You mean, like, I can go and have an actual normal friend?
Yeah. Babe, come on. We saved a man's life not having to use the Intersect;
just awesome husband/wife spy work.
maybe we can have some normal friends, too.
okay. Well, I'm going to go have a drink with a friend like a real live person.
have a great time. - Thanks.
Jeff, you have shown incredible improvement in motor skills, language ability, reflexes, memory.
it's like you're an actual person now. - Thank you.
I have started to see a lot of things more clearly.
Hey, guys. - Hey, Mommy.
Hi, muffin. Mommy missed you. Yes, she did.
babe, I have never seen such a perfect case study for an article on the effects of multiyear carbon monoxide poisoning.
we could get published. - That's so interesting.
Jeff, why don't you come by the hospital? We'll take a look.
let me see your belly. Let me see your belly. I could eat you.
let's go out here and see some fun stuff.
your woman is not happy.
what are you talking about?
fresh air has made me intuitive.
that woman... wants to be home with her child.
she'll never say it, but it's true.
Alex. - I am not here to talk to you. I'm here to see my dad.
look, I just wanted to apologize, that's all.
there's nothing you can say to make it okay.
you are just not the man I thought I loved.
you want the truth?
you ready? I had a supercomputer in my head, okay?
and it was melting my brain.
keep walking. Normal thoughts.
so, how do you like working private sector?
it's hard, right?
figuring everything out, choosing the right small business accounting program.
you're probably not feeling too chatty.
probably feeling bad we took down the best so easily.
probably too easily.
we were supposed to catch you.
Sarah, wait. Don't move. - Oh, my God. What?
look, I know we're trying to be normal people and all, but if we were in spy mode, we'd probably think it was kind of interesting timing that you made a new friend...
I'm Jane.
who wanted to hang out with you immediately post-mission.
a new friend who was as good as I was at passing a lie detector.
and we might wonder if the Viper didn't use a decoy, like we did, to make Morgan feel safe and come out of hiding.
and we might think that getting rid of his guards by, say, planting a car bomb, might be a really great way to go.
okay, here's a spy thought:
don't move your foot. - Okay.
I'm looking for Morgan Grimes.
you have to understand, this all... this all happened a couple years ago, okay?
now, I can't give you names and details,cause it's confidential - that sort of thing - but there were e -mails, and there were supercomputers, okay?
a supercomputer wound up in my brain. And I zoomed.
that's my word, not theirs, okay? But the supercomputer that I got was flawed, which is why all this sort of behavior was happening.
I'm really sorry. You have to believe me. My brain was melting. You know?
you look a little overwhelmed. I'll let you process that for a second there.
I'm sure the manager's around here somewhere.
I'll find him.
got to go now. Come with me. Just come with me. - No, Morgan. What are you doing?
you always do this.
you little barbarian son of a bitch.
help, help! Help!
skip, pull the fire alarm!
someone plug the hose! Everyone run to safety! I'm saving you!
I make no apologies for any of this, Jeffrey. I - I just needed you back, man.
pineapple!
Yep. Yep. That's-That's a bomb.
and it's a nice one.
okay. Listen to me.
this is what's happening, okay? There is an elusive assassin, and she is hunting me, okay?
you are legitimately insane. - What?
no. No, no, no, no. Please, please, look, look, look, look.
okay, okay. Okay. It's all right, stay calm. - She's there.
I know, I know.
I'm gonna rip your face off.
no, shh. Casey, listen to me. We have the wrong person, okay?
the real Viper is a lady. And she's here, hunting us.
northeast corner of the store. Get Alex to the broom closet.
you want to live, you're gonna take care of my daughter.
of course.
listen to me. We're gonna move when I say move, okay?
okay.
move.
Chuck, I'm getting some text. Jane is in the Buy More, and Casey's locked in the castle.
Ooh, man. Okay, well, tell them we'll be there in less than 90 seconds.
okay. Uh, you remember how to do this, right?
Yeah. Yeah. Maybe, kinda, yeah. I think so.
it's normally the red wire. Or the green wire.
it's normally the red or the green wire; I'm not really sure.
I want you to wait in here, all right? - Okay.
don't you move till I get back. She's after me.
I'm not gonna put you in danger. - Okay.
I love you.
you don't have to say it back at me.
would've been romantic, but, uh, it's fine. It's fine. Good.
God, I can't believe I trusted Jane to be who she said she was.
I must have been really desperate for a normal friend.
don't-don't beat yourself up.
and don't move your foot, really, because this is a very nasty bomb.
up with the leg. Up with the leg. Up with the leg. Keep that leg! Up with that leg.
there we go.
hello - Jane? Jane, it's Sarah.
um, I'm so sorry I'm running late. I'm having a really bad day, and I...
I just need somebody to talk to.
well, just come to the restaurant.
we'll workshop it.
no, I... I'm so upset, I don't think I can drive.
well, just get in the car, turn it on and get here.
I can't. My hands are shaking.
well, honey, look, I'm really sorry, okay?
I'm not gonna be able to help you right now.
I got to go. - No, no, wait.
Jane, Jane, I want to tell you something.
I - I feel, I feel really badly.
you've been so open and honest and sweet with me, and I'm so excited to have a new friend.
but I've been lying to you. About a couple of things.
I'm a spy.
boy, it feels good to say that to a real friend. By the way, you're amazing at what you do.
I really trusted you. And I don't do that very often.
well, you shouldn't.
wait, wait, stop! I have your bomb.
which means it's disarmed. Bye.
Thanks, honey.
I kind of thought maybe stepping into the middle of this might have been a bad idea after all, so...
I miss knowing kung fu.
remarkable work.
the Viper's perfect record has been broken.
uh, boom. Suck it.
sorry about that, sir.
I'm obviously relieved the mix-up was righted.
I would never have wanted you to complete your mission after the CIA called it off.
I am one of the good guys.
right. So, in front of all of these witnesses, on a recorded feed, the hit is off?
Yes. It's official, the hit is off.
all right, our business here is done.
good luck running a spy business with no Intersect, huh?
see ya never.
he's a quippy bastard.
so can someone get us out of this hole?
my pleasure. Follow me.
decker took that well. - Yeah, he did.
I'll take care of it.
so, we need to talk.
whatever. We're no longer friends, I get it.
like I care. - I do care.
I wish you were a better person.
but unfortunately, you need to learn there are repercussions for your actions.
so, you're under arrest.
what? For what?
attempted homicide.
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Morgan, we're not gonna get back together.
you told me that you were done with the spy life, and clearly you lied to me in a million different ways.
you're my hero, but you are not my boyfriend.
okay. - I'm sorry.
no, it's okay. I get it.
but, um, we can still be friends.
and I'm really glad we're both here tonight.
me, too.
we're putting out some hors d'oeuvres, if you guys want to come in.
is my dad here yet? - Uh, he's coming a little late.
you haven't said anything yet that's made me think you're still the man for the job.
I have a reputation to repair.
this will get done.
you need to understand, however, that I have to protect my cover.
obviously. Which means...
neutralizing everyone who knows who I am.
Walker, Grimes, Casey, Bartowski, Casey's daughter.
you have approval on everyone but Bartowski and Walker.
now get it done.
your life is over if you...
so, tell me about your day. Fun parts only, please.
fun parts only. Well, this week, I had to pose as Morgan Grimes.
you would need some serious hormone injections to get a beard like that.
okay, okay. Well, fortunately for me, my wife likes me baby smooth.
I do. My husband was the best human target a wife could ever ask for.
Aw, this is fun. Talking openly about our days.
it's the best.
Hey, everybody. Sorry I'm late.
no, perfect timing, man - we were about to sit down and eat. Here, I'll trade you.
excellent. Thanks.
Hey, Dad. Where were you?
Oh, just had an errand to run.
may I? Sure. Cheers.
uh, I'd like to make a toast.
Chuck and I have been a little sad this week that we aren't normal people.
I've been having a hard time with the fact that I have no real friends.
but I look around here at all of you today,
so, thank you and cheers.
Cheers.
I, too, have an announcement.
I'm going back to work. - Well, what?
wait, seriously? I thought you were happy at home.
no, I was just putting on a front, you know? I was going nuts.
Ellie is stepping up and taking care of baby Clara for awhile.
Yes, well, it was too soon for me to go back, anyway. I missed her too much.
she's totally saving me.
one more "Mommy and Me" class, I would've lost my mind.
I just wanted to tell you that you could probably, uh, ixnay on the whole killing me thing, because I'm not gonna bother Alex anymore.
you should move back in.
Really?
got you a gift.
come on, really?
indiana Jones.
I like these? - You did.
are you holding out on me? Is this the only three?
you're not, like, keeping the good ones for yourself or...
there's just the three. - Thanks, man.
I got it.
decker, what is this? - We're looking for John Casey.
John Casey! You're under arrest.
for murder.
Hi, I'm Chuck. Here are a few things that you might need to know.
the Omen. A computer virus that can erase a hundred zetabytes of data per second.
it could take down the Internet, crash airplanes, and erase every database in the world.
in truth, Chuck, the virus is just a piece of the plan.
what happens now? - That's the real surprise, isn't it?
there. The Omen is officially unleashed upon the world.
Christmas cheer? Try Christmas fear.
a virus dubbed "The Omen" has infected computers worldwide.
and it has Christmas shoppers in a panic.
are their hard drives in danger of being erased?
or, is the virus a gag that does nothing?
why panic? Ask yourself: what would baby Jesus do?
and you are...? - I'm Michael Tucker, assistant manager of Burbank Buy More.
I want customers to remember the true meaning of Christmas, and get back to what you're supposed to be doing:
buying stuff. - Like this iPad! A bargain for $599.
honestly, it's overpriced. You can get all this stuff on the Internet.
see, everything is fine here at the Buy More. Totally fine!
no computer virus problems here.
dear God! Jeffrey! I need your help, buddy. These people are animals.
the virus is everywhere, and nobody knows how to stop it!
nobody knows how to stop it!
what is going on here?
authorities do not know who is responsible for the Omen virus, but assume it is an act of cyber-terrorism...
every prison cell in here is connected to the mainframe.
what if the Omen virus hits us?
you worry too much. Take another snort of almond-milk nog.
open
do you hear that?
Ellie. Relax.
we are so behind! We are so crazy behind, and I can't find it!
find what? - The star for the top of the Christmas tree, the one that Dad gave me.
deep breaths, Namaste style.
Devon, it's Christmas Eve, we are having a party in six hours, we don't have a tree, we don't have decorations...
I am Eleanor Woodcomb.
what are you doing? - I am Eleanor Woodcomb.
saying your name aloud helps to calm you.
reminds you you're in control of your own actions.
I am Eleanor Woodcomb. - I am Eleanor Woodcomb.
Yeah, that didn't work. - Okay.
what are you freaking out about?
because Christmas was my first memory, okay?
the presents, the smell of fresh-baked cookies, and I know that Clara is a little young, but I thought that maybe it could be her first memory, too, and I just...
I want everything to be perfect.
all right. What's going to turn that frown upside down?
a real tree, lights, fake snow, and a picture of Clara on Santa's lap?
that's a tall order, babe. - I know.
but... that is why I recruited someone onto our team.
Ellie. - Sarah, I need an update.
it's okay. Project Santa is under control.
got the decorations from your list, you just need to get the tree and the snow.
Thanks. - Okay, bye.
Hey, Sarah.- Your sister is in full-blown Christmas mode.
well, it wouldn't be Christmas with the Bartowskis without a little bit of drama.
speaking of which... - No progress on the virus?
whoever's behind this is a ghost. Untraceable.
no. There is no such thing. They just haven't slipped up yet.
and when they do? Carmichael Industries will be there to take them down.
but for now, I promise nobody is going to ruin our Christmas.
just everyone else's.
Chuck, it's going to be okay.
look, I'm going to lock up Castle and come home.
Oh, by the way, will you tell Casey, uh...
Mr. Pippers, the Preppy Polar Bear, has arrived.
Mr. Pippers? Really?
Oh, man, that's like our favorite childhood toy, right?
one of, yeah. - Top five. Maybe.
but still, our generation. Not really yours.
I got it on eBay.
Alex's mom said she used to run around with a little bear thing like that.
it's still in its original package.
I thought it was a good idea. Dumb, huh?
no. It's actually quite touching.
like you're feeling real human emotion.
don't you ever say that again. And don't you breathe a word of this to Alex.
no. No. My lips are... my lips are sealed.
Christmas presents are sacred in the Grimes family.
gentlemen. - General.
we have an emergency. We know who's behind this.
merry Christmas, Sarah.
miss me? - Not for a second.
that's no way to treat an old boyfriend.
just give up, Walker. You're no match for the Intersect.
comfy?
no?
good.
69% complete.
only a couple more hours before the virus activates.
what are you doing, Shaw?
you're the one behind the Omen? The plan?
surprise. - Why?
why stay in jail when I can break out, release the virus...
...and take over the CIA?
gave away my plan.
Sarah, thank God! Shaw broke out of prison, where are you?
Sarah? - Hello, nerd.
do me a favor?
turn on the monitor.
merry Christmas!
Hey, can I tell you a story? - You untie Sarah right now.
there's this tradition in Germany where Santa Claus or Krampus, as they call him visits all the naughty children on Christmas Eve.
but instead of giving them coal, he wakes them up, and the naughtiest of children never see Christmas Day.
let her go. - Or what?
no Sarah, no Intersect... You're worthless, Chuck.
I've put Castle on lockdown. Do everything I say.
or she dies.
get my drift? - Why are you doing this?
because you put me in jail? Because of our last fight, because you tried to kill me?
so much history, Chuck. It could be anything.
fine. What do you want? - The CIA base downtown.
break into Clyde Decker's office, retrieve the Macau device, and bring it to me.
what is it? What does it look like?
figure it out. You have three hours.
don't you hurt her.
impressed?
I implicated Chuck in a massive conspiracy, and captured his girl.
all from an 8x8 cell.
you... working with Clyde Decker? How?
decker was a slug.
he tried to interrogate me, and in one flash I knew all his filthy secrets.
a little blackmail, and his entire team was working for me.
you know what the best part is?
there's nothing that Chuck can do to stop me.
what now, Chuck?
Oh, boy.
this is bad. This is really bad. He is shutting down.
then we take care of Shaw ourselves.
Yeah, but he has the Intersect. I mean, we're going to need a plan, a really good plan.
I've got the plan.
Daniel Shaw murdered my father, and now he has my wife.
he's gonna wish he never left that prison cell.
that plan's kind of vague.
Morgan, I need you to reverse-engineer that virus. Use the nerds.
if they're focused, they're better than any computer expert in the CIA.
we need to figure out exactly what happens when that virus activates.
I'm on it.
Casey. Find alternate routes into Castle.
I need options in case I can't get the device that Shaw wants.
whoa, whoa, hold on. You're going to break into the CIA?
Decker's office is on level five. Omega level.
you go in alone, it's suicide.
who said anything about going in there alone?
the Macau device was stolen two months ago from a Chinese technology company.
it compresses huge quantities of data to fit onto a single computer hard drive.
why would Shaw want it?
I have no idea.
what's the best way for me to get into the CIA?
there's only one way in.
with me.
general, I can't tell you how happy I am to hear you say that, but you realize you're putting yourself on the line here.
this is my team. And nobody, especially Shaw, is going to take us down.
I just got off the phone with Buy More Corporate.
they want to know everything there is to know about this Omen virus
what happens when it activates.
in order to stop it, we need to know its next move.
Fold.- I-no, no.
you guys are the only ones that understand C++ and a bunch of other computer languages, okay?
I need you to crack this thing, I need you to do it now.
Yeah. N.I. - What?
not interested. - Thank you.
it's an immature response, I know, but I, too, am underincentivized.
until this virus is cracked, nobody's buying any crap at the Buy More.
which means no double overtime and no Christmas bonus.
true. But it seems a little above and beyond our usual duties.
name your price. - I got this.
I would like a... six-inch Classic Italian BMT from Subway. Boom.
I was going to say a trip to the Bahamas.
subway. Done. I'll make it a footlong.
nice! Make mine flatbread, boys!
I'm going into Castle, in through the ducts.
all right. Hey, be careful.
it's a war zone.
some scrooge stole Christmas right out of the Buy More.
Mike, I'm really sorry to bother you. Maybe we should just forget it.
you kidding?
getting this angel her picture with Santa might be the only cheer I get to spread around here this year.
let Santa just grab his suit.
damn hell!
what kind of monster steals a Santa suit on Christmas Eve, but leaves the eyebrows?
I am Eleanor Woodcomb.
babe, don't worry, I'm calling in the big guns.
Chuck, there's been a robbery at the Buy More.
brace yourself: the Santa suit is gone.
well, that's terrible. Sounds like someone could use a dose of the Christmas spirit.
just promise me that you and Sarah will make it in time for Christmas dinner.
Ellie really needs her family around right now.
Yeah, yeah, of course, buddy. We wouldn't miss it for the world.
my wife has been kidnapped, and I'm officially ruining Christmas for the children of Burbank.
we have a CIA Christmas party to crash.
now let's go save our girl.
Why's it getting so cold in here?
tapped into the internal generator, lowered the temperature.
to stop the mainframe from overheating.
once the virus activates, the resulting data influx could fry it in seconds.
you with me?
no, you're not.
if you were, you would've brought a coat, silly.
you're going into hypothermic shock.
pretty soon, you'll be in and out of consciousness until finally your heart stops beating.
why don't you just kill me?
kill you?
this is about you.
why do you think I wanted you in Castle and I sent Chuck to the CIA?
we both know that you're the superior spy.
I've missed you. - You're insane.
what we had was special. I know you felt it.
I'm sure you've laid in bed at night thinking about me beside you.
I'd rather be dead.
got what I needed.
this is Sarah Walker, and Daniel Shaw is in complete control of me.
I don't know what your plan is, but... it's not going to work.
Shaw's so handsome and smart. I bet he reads lots of books.
you think you can beat Chuck?
you're not half the man that he is.
you're not half the man that he is.
this isn't about Chuck, Sarah.
this really is about you.
see, I'm finally going to crush your soul...
the way that you crushed mine.
12 inches of bubbly cheese, spicy pepperoni and ham.
you really should try the Fresh Fit option.
no-no offense.- Thank you.
what have we got so far?
all right, so if this virus hits at the expected rate and magnitude, everything electronic will shut down-- traffic lights, computers.
God, can you imagine a world without the Internet? What if it's up to us?
two Buy More employees left to stop the Omen virus and save the world.
come on. The government has their best people working on this. Right?
God, I hate corporate Christmas parties.
everyone turns into sloppy, embarrassing messes.
Oh, Stan, not again.
how about joining me at the punch bowl?
enough. You're embarrassing yourself, Stan.
well, if that's gonna be your attitude.
that is so weird.
Los Angeles spies.
now focus.
the woman by the giant Subway sandwich is your target.
Colonel Caroline Hayne.
she's in charge of internal security with electronic access to every room in this building, including Decker's office.
so what's our next move? - Seduce her, Bartowski.
steal her key card.
she's a notorious tight ass, except for one night of the year.
tonight. Six hot toddies and men are running for cover.
and you're sure I'm her type?
you're drawing breath and you're in a Santa suit.
merry Christmas.
or Happy Hanukkah. Whichever is applicable.
you look like you want some alone time with old Saint Nick.
I want to sit on your lap.
I don't think Mrs. Claus would approve of any "shenanigans," you know.
well, it's a good thing Mrs. Claus is a no-show.
Oh, that seems inappropriate!
Ooh, yeah! Naughty Santa.
that's just how I like it.
Mr. Claus, I will personally escort you off the premises.
Oh, what a shame! Merry Christmas! Happy Kwanzaa!
pull yourself together.
play a little cat and mouse? Fine.
but I'll find you.
I know you're unarmed. The armory's been on lockdown.
you can't hide.
I know every secret, every mission, every mistake.
scar on your left hand-- Calgary, 2004.
you never tried catching throwing stars after that, did you?
I know everything, Sarah.
I know everything.
you're upset with me. That's obvious.
but do you really think I want to spend the holidays with you?
that I wouldn't rather be with my family?
it's a trick question, Sarah.
because you shot my wife in cold blood.
you brought this all upon yourself.
very disappointing, Casey.
never took Decker for much of an art collector.
I think I found it.
Colonel Hayne just accessed Decker's office, but I'm looking at her. She's in the bullpen.
we got a code five.
this way, Colonel Hayne.
our minute came and went.
what are we gonna do? There's no place to hide.
pucker up, Bartowski. You're about to become a man.
what, like a Bar Mitzvah? Or something that's a little... What exactly are you...
Santa!
retreat immediately or I will see you court-martialed!
you know, I typically brush my teeth before I... - We never speak of this again.
never... ever...
Shaw, I've got the device.
Chuck, it's me.
Sarah, oh, my God. You okay? - Yeah.
I escaped Shaw and I'm hiding in Castle,...
but Shaw's still down here--hurry!
I'm on my way.
I know, I know, I know. It's a madhouse. It's a madhouse.
good thing is that Jeff and Lester made some progress. How'd your day go?
I got the Macau Device, and Sarah's hiding out in Castle.
Sarah. Hey. Is everything okay?
Casey disarmed Shaw. He's locked up.
thank God. I'll be there soon. - Hurry up, dear.
how'd that go? Everything all right?
Sarah says that Casey took down Shaw.
Yes! Nice! Way to go.
she called me "dear. " She never calls me dear.
Shaw's using her somehow.
Oh, crap. Last time he was in control, he bought the Buy More.
Morgan, we've got to get all these people out of here.
I tried, Morgan. But we haven't made a single sale all night. I'm sorry.
don't be. Don't be, buddy. It's okay.
attention, Buy More shoppers.
I know everyone's a little scared about this Omen virus...
but, uh, you should not be waiting in line on Christmas Eve.
all right? It's not about the gifts, it's about spending time with your friends and your family.
And-and-and-and eggnog and cheer-- spreading lots of cheer.
so, uh, as of now, uh, the Buy More is officially closed for the holiday.
sorry! Thank you, come again and, uh, and shop at Buy More.
sorry! Sorry! You're gonna have to... gonna have to, kinda...
Thanks, buddy.
well, come on, son, I'll drive you home.
your mama's cooking us a big, fat, honey-glazed ham.
you know what? I'm gonna stay here and close up shop.
can you make sure everyone gets out safe?
all right. - Okay.
what's happening? - Ellie, what are you...? What are you...?
We're-We're-We're closing down for the night.
the picture with Santa was a bust.
I sent Devon and Clara home. Mom's flight's cancelled.
Sarah was supposed to help with the decorations, and now she's not answering her phone.
have you heard from her?
Yeah, uh, sort of. She's kind of busy.
Chuck, what's going on?
it's Shaw.
he kidnapped Sarah.
Daniel Shaw, who killed Dad?
what can I do?
I... I hate to say this--just-just go home. - No, I want to help!
Ellie, please, go home, okay? I have to know that you're safe.
okay, but call me. Call me as soon as you know something, okay?
Yes. Yes. Okay.
Chuck, you be careful. - I love you.
you sick son of a bitch!
just wanted to see if any of the old fire was still there.
no. Ice-cold.
this was Mary Bartowski's, wasn't it?
I think I'll keep it.
token of our last night together.
I had no idea she was your wife, Shaw.
I had no idea who you were. I was just... I was just on an assignment.
is that supposed to make me feel better?
I was just a young agent. I was just doing my job, okay?
you, of all people, need to understand that.
Really?
well, what about the pit you dug out of my chest?
is that supposed to fill it in?
is this going to?
you're a good man, Shaw. You can be that man again.
just stop what you're doing, please. Okay?
you can let this... you can let this all go.
I know you're in pain, and you want this to stop, but not yet.
not until you feel a pain more excruciating than you ever imagined.
Chuck is coming up with a way to stop you as we speak.
we have reason to believe this whole entire Omen virus, end of the world, apocalyptic thingy--it's a hoax--it's literally a hoax.
the virus is hypothetically designed to suck information out of a whole set of computers and move that information to a single location.
but it's not doing that. It's absolutely not doing that.
or it's not doing that with our computers. It looks like this virus is targeting government computers.
I think it's a real-life conspiracy.
problem is, no one computer can hold all that information.
right? Right? - Yeah. Of course not. Of course not...
Morgan, it's not going into a computer.
Shaw is using the Macau Device to relocate the CIA database into his brain.
he's trying to create the Intersect 3. 0.
Oh, crap. With the CIA's databases wiped clean, they'll have to rely on Shaw for their intel.
they have to make him a spy again.
gentlemen! Gentlemen, uh... the Buy More is closed.
you can go home. Happy holidays. Maybe drink some water.
water can only dilute this feeling.
Plus, fish have sex in it. Jeffrey, let's go for a run.
great idea. Great idea. - Great idea.
all right, Chuck, tell me you got some kind of an idea here,'cause I'm a little scared.
don't freak out. I've got an idea.
I just hope it works. - Me, too.
seeing as how our lives kind of depend on it.
you knew that, right? - Yeah.
you've got the device. Now let Sarah go and take me instead.
and why would I trust you?
look at the monitor.
buy More is empty. You can come up here and kill me.
as long as Sarah's safe.
pitiful.
good, you're awake.
you know what the ultimate revenge is?
spending Christmas Eve with you.
I'm gonna let you live.
I want you to watch while I kill your husband.
Chuck has a plan. - So do I.
and I've spent the last two years in prison, perfecting it.
you killed my wife.
now you're gonna suffer, just like I did.
you're gonna spend the rest of your life without Chuck.
Hi, I'm Mr. Pippers, the Preppy Polar Bear.
you can leave a message by pressing hard on my paw. Have fun.
dad...
I just want you to know that I'm proud of you...
and I'm sorry I haven't been there for you all these years.
and I'm really sorry that I'm having to tell you this recorded on an electronic bear.
electronic bear.
I'm unarmed.
you can shoot me now, if that's your plan.
but for some reason, I don't think it is.
no, you're absolutely right.
it's very important that I enjoy this.
Really?
well, that's a nice idea, Shaw.
however, if I remember correctly, the last time we were face to face, I kicked your ass.
I made sure that'll never happen again.
no Intersect to help you this time, Chuck.
I wouldn't be too sure about that.
I've been training for a while now.
Oh, really?
well, can you compete with the Intersect 3. 0?
I can practically catch a bullet in my teeth.
but you did some push-ups? You hit the heavy bag?
Oh, just so you know, while you're begging for mercy, your wife is watching.
I've spent every waking second in jail thinking about this moment.
this time, I'm going to kill you.
you seriously underestimate the power of the Nerd Herd.
the Omen virus-- you put it...
inside your head. Instead of downloading the Intersect 3. 0, you removed it.
and it turns out that's the last flash you're ever going to have.
I'm a much bigger nerd than you thought I was.
Oh, geez.
wake up. Wake... Oh, my God, you're like an ice cube.
hang in there. I got this. I got this.
uh, I'm going to pick you up with the chair. All right, so just bear with me.
okay.
Oh, man.
one, two...
I'm still going to kill you.
I'd like to see you try.
I've been working on that one. That one's for Sarah.
is that all you got? - I got a little bit more.
all right, listen to me. Listen to me. You're going to have to wake up.
you have to wake up because you're bolted in here and I don't have a key for the lock.
what are you...? Y-you're shot. You're-you're bleeding.
shut up, numbnuts. We got to get her out of here.
get her.
dear"? "Hurry up, dear"?
sloppy, Shaw.
won't happen again.
that was for my dad.
you're good, Chuck.
but you're not lucky.
that was for me.
nice shot, sis.
but I told you to stay at home.
I'm Eleanor Woodcomb. Since when do I do what I'm told?
that man took our father away from us, Chuck.
I wasn't going to let him take anybody else.
merry Christmas, Ellie.
merry Christmas, Chuck.
authorities have confirmed, that the Omen virus was planted by a terrorist named Daniel Shaw.
a private security team stopped him before the virus was activated.
and although they've chosen to remain anonymous, we here at KCKH want to say thank you and also wish our viewers a happy holiday.
and now, onto other news, where a dog barks like a duck.
all members of Carmichael Industries have a position open to them at the CIA.
the agency would be lucky to have you back.
well, we couldn't have done it without you. So thanks, colleague.
with that, I'll bid you farewell and Merry Christmas.
do you have a place to spend the holidays? You could come to our place.
Yeah, but, Sarah, I think my Christmas party's a bust. - No, no, no, no.
your Christmas party is not a bust, sis.
don't you know that when you roll with General Diane Beckman, you roll in style?
general...
don't you think the CIA could help us throw just a little eensy-weensy Bartowski family Christmas party?
you're talking about American tax dollars at work.
Oh, hell, let's do it.
that's the spirit.
thank you, thank you, thank you.
I know that without Mom and Dad around, it could never be a perfect Christmas, but I hope you know that you'll always have me.
I do.
felt pretty good taking down Shaw.
I think Dad would be proud.
I know he would be.
I miss him. - Me, too.
I love you. - I love you, too.
merry Christmas.
I, uh... made a recording when things got a little grim.
it's just that... it's probably better I tell you in person.
I love you.
I love you, too, Dad.
I know it's a... just a little bear.
it's not going to make up for all the lost holidays, but...
no, it's... it's perfect.
you know, that... that Grimes kid, he's not that bad.
you should... maybe give him another chance.
it was fun, man. Like old times, before you got all smart.
it's actually the only Christmas Eve I remember.
I'm usually drunk on Manischewitz by now.
I miss that.
thank you.
for defeating Daniel Shaw? For stopping the Omen virus?
or was it me getting us invited to rejoin the CIA?
for saving me. - Technically, Morgan saved you.
because of all the saving that was going on,
I wasn't able to get you your gift in time for Christmas; however... however...
an oldie, but a goodie.
I hope that this will suffice for now.
thank you.
smile!
Oh, now she'll always be able to remember her first Christmas.
merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.
Chuck, you should know that, um, while I was tied up in Castle, Shaw kissed me.
well, as long as we're airing things out, you should know...
that Beckman kissed me.
Walker. A word.
general, I know about the, um... with you and Chuck.
we all have to make sacrifices for the job.
Shaw requested a meet with you.
I suggest you don't go.
what?
I'm glad you came.
I'll be locked in solitary the rest of my life.
but one thing's going to keep me warm at night.
little something I put into motion that you'll never be able to stop.
do you remember Hungary?
Hi, I'm Chuck. Here are a few things that you might need to know.
the Intersect made me a total jerk.
not that it was completely the Intersect's fault.
I mean, it just kind of brought out my inner jerk.
don't scuff it, all right, Cabbage Patch?
I am really sorry for what I did to Alex.
this whole thing has gotten me thinking about our... our lives, our future.
is the spy lifestyle really where we want to be raising our kids?
this is what I think our coworkers are really up to.
you think they're spies?
I knew it! Lester...
for the record, I love this.
this is the most fun you and I have had together in quite some time.
Yeah. We should make more time for us.
anyway, I still don't get it-- I don't see how this is going to make them forget that they found Castle.
short-term memory eraser.
they'll forget the last 24 hours.
Oh, right. Gotcha.
they come to, think they tied one on in Vegas, boom, they're back to normal.
or whatever normal was for these guys.
Yeah. Right.
pop this right here. Watch this.
Ah, that's not professional.
of course. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's good.
good?
morning.
I want to quit spying.
okay.
okay, let's, uh... let's talk about that.
look, I-I... I've been up all night, and I... I've been thinking about our futures and, you know, maybe babies.
Oh. Yeah. - And I want all of that, but the more I think about it, I just don't know if that future goes with the life that we're living right now.
I mean, both of us have been captured more than once.
every day, we make a new dangerous enemy. And I just ran to the front door with a gun because I heard the newspaper being delivered.
Yeah, parents can't be shooting the paperboy.
look, I'm a spy, and that's all I ever thought that I could be, but I realized that we don't have to give up what we've already built.
we can just shift what Carmichael Industries does.
okay, shift it to what?
countering cyberterrorism.
it's your tech firm idea, but more spied up-- so we keep your computer know-how and mix it with my experience in international bad guy-ery.
so we go after bad guys who use keyboards instead of bullets.
which means we don't have to use bullets, either.
I mean, the timing of it does kind of feel right.
we've got nothing left hanging. No new missions.
no wrongs to right.
let's do it.
now, how do we pitch the idea to Casey?
well, I love it. Okay?
you know how I feel about bullets, which is to say negatively, okay?
this is fantastic.
where do I fit in? What am I, chief Googler?
well, actually, you'd be doing a lot of the same stuff that you already do.
Yeah, I mean, we're still going to need field ops to recover stolen systems and breaching companies' security to find their weak spots.
Plus, wouldn't it be lovely not to get shot at? - Exactly.
aren't you sick of being shot at? - Or getting shot?
I mean, you get shot a lot.
not considering how much I get shot at.
okay. Think about Alex.
do you know how happy she will be, knowing that you're not out there doing scary stuff?
all right, I'll think about it.
but one thing's for sure--we go through with this, no more Buy More. We don't need a cover.
let's kick the creepy cousin out of the family.
no more Buy More.
son, this came for you.
boy, get your fingers out of there!
how you doing, Big Mike?
always a beautiful day at the Buy More.
you really love it here, don't you?
like a turkey loves Thanksgiving.
you might want to rethink that one, actually, you know.
my old iPhone.
doesn't really seem to be your style.
no, no, yeah, this was from a few months ago. I was kind of going through a thing
the frosted tips phase.
made it real hard not to smack you.
Yeah, I can imagine.
Lord.
Chuck... Chuck, if you're getting this, something has gone terribly wrong.
I was... I was getting my party on, having a great time.
okay, this dude comes up to me with this pair of Intersect glasses, and he grabs me.
I kick his ass.
no prob.
I grab the glasses, and I stash them.
dude, I stash them in a vault.
but, like I was saying, I have been partying my freaking face off, so I'm a little discombobulated.
which is an amazing word.
so, if this guy catches up to me, want you to know something.
I know that you know that you love me.
tell the world of my glory.
but above... above all, you find those glasses.
you find them. Aah!
Morgan, what is this, and where were you?
I don't know, Chuck. I don't know.
between the Intersect mind-melting and, clearly, copious amounts of booze, it's all a blank.
thank God I bought that label maker you all made fun of, because at least I got the phone back.
so there's a stolen Intersect out there somewhere.
guess we're not retired after all, huh?
well, it doesn't change the plan. It just means we have one last mission.
why would she... - Come on, Walker.
No! - What?
things never turn out well when you say "one last mission.
is this just because of some stupid movie?
Yes.
you never say "one last mission."
come on. - Never.
Yeah, I was... I was so cool back then.
uh, counterpoint. Are you wearing a fake dreadlock ski hat?
Really? Is that...
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I was.
look at the dates on these phone calls. It's when you were working for Verbanski.
and look at these text messages.
there's a name-- "BD."Does that jog your memory?
negative. No, what does BD say?
Where'd you go?
all right, well, maybe send BD a message.
if they were with you the night you found the glasses, then maybe we can get a clue.
sorry, disappeared. What's up?
no, I was a little more douchey than that.
Uh,"Wassup?" You know, with a bunch of S's?
sure.
and in the meantime, let's try and find a way to help you remember something.
what is it exactly that you two think I do for a living?
brain science.
I mean, didn't you learn how to hypnotize people at school to get at lost memories?
Yeah, in psychotherapy class, but that was years ago.
fine. Okay.
thank you. Thank you.
okay, I really hope this works.
I'm a little skeptical,'cause...
I don't think this brain can be hypnotized. It's like a fortress.
so, focus. Look at the pen.
deep breaths.
breathe.
sweet mother of all that is holy.
dude, what happened? Where are we?
I don't... I don't know. You're wearing a Vegas hat.
we must have gone to Vegas... and stole a car.
Yeah, we must have just partied too hard, and now...
a woman gave us her underpants?
breathe on me.
there's no alcohol on your breath. Just gefilte fish curry, like always.
Really?
Lester, something really weird is up.
Yeah, last... last thing I remember is that there's something going on underneath the Buy More.
Yeah, that's right-- with Bartowski and Grimes and Casey and that whorey blonde.
we've got to get to the bottom of this. - You're right.
and we're going to do that by sticking to those fools like the stink on my breath.
now, to the Buy More.
careful.
careful.
light traffic day.
I think Morgan might really be hypnotized in there.
great. Hey, hey, look, I've been looking at, uh, some new possible office spaces.
above ground. We could have windows.
if we ever get there.
what do you mean?
it just seems like no matter what, the Intersect keeps finding me.
I keep trying to break free, and the very thing that started this keeps hooking us back in.
Chuck, we're going to finish this. And we're going to move on, I promise you.
Hey, Casey, you want to see your new office space?
no,'cause we ain't out yet.
even if it belonged to a little someone named Ronald Wilson Reagan?
Seriously?
the Gipper?
Hey, guys, I got something.
morgan keeps repeating the phrases "emerald and gold" and the number "ten.
emerald and gold, what does that mean?
I don't know. I tried to push him a little further, but I think I got a little too aggressive.
you are so hot.
you're so hot. And if you went to prom with me,
I would be the stokedest guy in high school.
I think I took him back too far.
it's possible.
okay, Morgan, let's undo this. Look at the pen.
I don't know how to look at anything but you.
you're so beautiful.
Wow. Hey, I didn't say anything stupid while I was under, did I?
no. No-no-no. You get a return text yet?
no. No-no-no.
uh, are you the manager?
I want to return this blender.
Yeah, sure, I'll take care of that for you.
do you have a receipt? - Let me check.
are you in a serious relationship?
excuse me?
I just want to know if you're in a serious relationship right now.
I'll call you back.
uh, I actually am, yeah. Anyway, back to the blender...
do you love her?
that's a really personal question for a blender return.
Dale, I told you to stop bothering me.
Morgan, I am so, so sorry.
Yeah, no, sure.
um, who's Dale?
he's just a guy I went out with a few times when we broke up. He's nobody.
really. - Nobody?
Oh, so I guess it was nobody that
wait, how did you put it? Filled your body with rainbows?
please tell me he's talking about finger painting, all right?
because I don't even understand how that even works.
Morgan, please, there's nothing between us, okay?
I was just hurt, and I was missing you, and so I acted out a little physically.
you acted out physically? Oh, I think I'm going to be sick.
there were rainbows.
I love him, Dale. So just stop coming here.
I... I got my text.
thank God.
let's talk later, you and I, okay?
there he is.
Dale. - Hey, John.
what?
you're the one that pulled the text message breakup.
Alex, always great to see you. Dale, store credit only.
we never hugged. - Are you kidding me?
sorry.
where are they? We lost them, we lost them!
she acted out physically?!
Morgan, I know this is hard, but you did dump her via text.
I know, the whole text thing. I know I shouldn't be mad, but I am.
you want to know why? Because I was true blue, baby, that's right.
while she was out there gallivanting all over town, spreading her filthy rainbows to every
Tom, Dick and Harry, I stayed strong, dude. I did.
you know what, I need to know every detail.
every little morsel I got to find out.
buddy, buddy, I know you're upset, but I don't think knowing all the gory rainbowed details is going to make you feel any better about it.
right, boss.
guys, look. There's a Golden Peak Resort in Vail, Colorado, and...
look, here. It's a Michael Carmichael registered the night in question.
Hey, looks like that's our ski town. All right, kids, let's pack up.
Morgan, sadly you're going to need to look the way you did that weekend, so do you still have any more of that hair bleach and your Affliction T-shirt?
who would know? Why...? Yes.
great, let's go.
looks like all of Vail is here.
hope BD is, too.
any of this triggering a memory, Grimes?
Nope, nothing yet.
you two better love each other.
it's sickening the amount of meaningless physical encounters that happen nowadays.
bd? BD is Bo Derek?
thought I'd never see you again, lover.
Hello, Bo Derek's tongue.
Wow. Morgan, you need to stay with it. We need to find out everything she knows, okay?
I thought for sure I'd hear from you sooner. Bad boy.
you're the guy who made out with Bo Derek, so act like it.
Yeah, I know. That's just bad boy stuff.
that's just how I roll.
Hi, Bo Derek. I'm Chuck. My name is Chuck.
really big, big fan.
just loved just so, so much. - We really do.
Yeah, I know what you did with that poster.
Oh, no, no, no. I-- I wouldn't...
not that I didn't love the poster as a boy.
how do you know my friend here? - I don't like to kiss and tell, but your friend rocked my world one magical night in November.
Seriously? Seriously?
Seriously? Seriously?
no, I'll never forget that... that evening.
but, um, How did I got about that-- the rocking?
words would ruin it, but, uh, there were definitely rainbows involved.
there's that... Check that out, there were rainbows.
I guess Alex wasn't the only one with secrets, huh?
Bo, what exactly happened that evening? Because I'm a little fuzzy, you know，
with all the gluggity, gluggity, gluggity. - You were a bit out of hand.
come on, I'll show you.
I'm always out of hand.
Oh, seems like a lot of people might know what you did that night.
he was telling everyone who would listen, how he'd saved the world that day.
you're such a funny bunny.
I am. What else did I mention?
you know, because I lost something and I'm trying to retrace my steps.
Yeah, what did Funny Bunny do when he left the bar?
he came to my room.
Morgan, maybe the vault that the glasses are in is a safe in Bo Derek's room.
you need to get up there now.
I have a girlfriend.
yeah? Well, you should have remembered that two months ago.
now get to work.
they're looking for a vault. Write that down.
we are not forgetting anything this time.
man, this brings back some memories.
speaking of which, you're not still staying in that room are you?
because if you are-- oh, boy, ding, ding, ding, round two.
come on.
Oh, have fun, tiger. You know I will.
you remember this?
Yes, yes, I do. Who could forget this?
Hey, now.
okay. Incidentally, Bo Derek, is this where the rainbows happened?
I'm curious only because they've been coming up a lot lately, and I would love to know specifically what makes them happen? What is the trigger, you know.
I'll show you.
Yeah, cool. Can't wait.
taking off my pants now, Chuck.
Oh, dude, Bo Derek is taking your pants off.
just go with it, okay? Ask her to tell you more about that night.
Hey, so, um, you know what I would lov-love, love?!
totally love, Bo Derek, is, um...
tell me the story about our night together.
Oh, okay. Mm-hmm.
but only if you tell me exactly what you've done since I was with you last.
deal, lover. - So I first noticed you when you were getting a lap dance from that dirty whore Jaclyn Smith.
and that was when he got the whole bar singing "Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go," unironically.
right, so he didn't tell you anything else about his night?
he got me pretty wasted.
I woke up the next morning behind the bar in a puddle of Rumplemintz.
and then we played the funniest game, where you hid and I found you, and then I hid and you found me.
Oh, man, so fun.
well, all I've been able to dig up is what we already know.
Grimes was an ass.
Yeah, I'm getting the same thing. Hey, Chuck, how's it going with Bo?
have you had any sneak peeks of your childhood crush's boobies?
what? No.
shut up.
we have a situation.
Oh, you are kidding me. How did they track us here?
this is what you get when you fly commercial. I'll take care of it.
copy
Hey, were you just asking about Morgan Grimes?
uh, yes. - Ha, ha, ha. That dude's hilarious.
I gave him the most wacked tattoo ever.
you gave him a tattoo?
tattoo.
Morgan, I need you out here ASAP. Be careful.
you know what I'm going to do?
I'm going to get us a little fresh ice. What do you think about that?
okay.
hurry back. - No problem, okay.
and bring back a couple extra cubes for play time.
you two.
do whatever you want. We know what's going on here.
we're not, we're not going to forget.
I disagree.
what is that? That smells nice.
doesn't it?
that woman is into me. And I'm really scared that whatever is going to take place in there is going to be way worse than whatever acting out Alex did.
plus we were broken up, so technically...Buddy, buddy, you have a tattoo.
no, I do not.
what? Aw! What are you...?
don't trust Bo Derek.
that's what your tattoo says.
come on, she must be involved with the Intersect theft.
not the strangest place a man has tattooed my name.
now take me to the glasses.
I'm just going to go out and say it--you're no longer a perfect 10.
I know you remember something.
my backup is on the way And you do not want to know what they will do...
sorry, I had to do that to your girlfriend.
Oh... You didn't hit her in the face, did you?
I'm kidding. But it is Bo Derek. Okay.
Ow. Sweet mother of all that is holy.
dude, what happened? Where are we?
I don't... I don't know. You're wearing a Vegas hat.
we must've gone to Vegas.
Yeah, stole a car. Must have just partied too hard, and now...
a woman gave us her underpants?
breathe on me.
there's no alcohol on your breath. Just gefilte fish curry like always.
last thing I remember was that there was something going on underneath the Buy More.
so...
tell me about your night with Morgan, and this time for real.
Yes, please.
and how Bo Derek got involved with the Intersect.
listen, acting isn't the only gig I got because of my looks and my capacity to make believe.
are you trying to say that Bo Derek is a spy?
my boss had gotten word someone was running around the intelligence community, bragging that he was the Intersect.
so we were already on the lookout for him when he surfaced so publicly one night in Vail.
publicly? Ah, I doubt that.
pretty sure I was keeping a low profile.
who wants to party with the freaking Intersect?!
I am the most powerful weapon in the world!
you, maybe.
you, uh...
hello...
that was real?
and a follow-up question: If that was real, were the rainbows real?
it meant nothing.
it was only physical.
what is it with women and this "only phys..."?
what happened next?
then I drugged you and called my boss.
hmm? You take that back. You take that back 'cause this Intersect...
this Intersect can almost focus on your stupid face, and when I do...
shut up. Morgan Grimes
aka Morgan Carmichael-- which is ridiculous.
you're not the only one with the Intersect, honey bunny.
I spent a lot of time and money getting these glasses.
I haven't used them yet because I hear there are side effects.
well, you seem fine.
Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine. It's you.
you made an enormous mistake telling me all this.
see your men here? Done, finished. I'm gonna take them out.
and then I'm gonna hunt you down, and I'm gonna arrest you for treason.
I don't think so,'cause you're not gonna remember any of this.
as soon as you fall asleep, the last 24 hours of your little life will just disappear.
and here's how confident I am of that.
nice to meet you.
I'm Nicholas Quinn.
and I'm about to become the Intersect.
give me the glasses!
sorry, Bo Derek!
okay, so we're looking for Nicholas Quinn.
Bo Derek's been working for him.
Bo Derek's a spy?
I know, right? And a talky one to boot.
Quinn's got an independent spy agency, but not like ours.
Ooh, nothing like ours. This guy's list of clients is gnarly.
you're talking about Libyan Islamic fighting group, Kim Jong-il.
and a couple of favorites as well, like FULCRUM, the Ring and Volkoff Industries.
what? We've put some of his biggest clients behind bars.
did we get Kim Jong-il?
he's been getting screwed by the Intersect for years. No wonder he wants it.
okay, so the fat lip we can blame on the tattoo.
the ski jacket and the boxers we can blame on Bo Derek, but where are the glasses? And where is this vault?
I don't know. Guys, I don't know.
Bo Derek said that was the last she saw of me.
I wouldn't have just stashed the Intersect anywhere.
I would have put it somewhere safe. Someplace that I knew. And that's, that's my guess, anyway.
Oh, boy.
okay, let me, let me deal with this. I'll be back, uh...
I gotta come clean on a few things.
buddy, buddy, are you sure you want to do that? Because
I think maybe we should just, you know let the past be the past.
you slept with Bo Derek?
Yeah. Maybe more than once.
I acted out physically, too.
and I, uh, I rocked Bo Derek's world.
sorry. Um, Morgan...
no, I'm not, I'm not lying. Are you kidding me?
no. I made rainbows shoot out of this woman.
there's Grimes. Let's just confront him.
I know he's a part of this.
wait. We are being sabotaged. Mm-hmm.
we gotta fly under the radar, quietly keep an eye on them and record on our person anything we learn.
great idea.
I gotta pee.
it's 3: 14 p. m. Write that down.
look, you were with Dale, I was with Bo Derek, we're even.
let's move past it now. - Okay.
okay, baby. We are even.
that's my girl. Okay.
son, do you have the master key?
I checked the vault, it wasn't there.
What'd you just say?
the key. I checked the manager's vault.
any ideas?
sweet lady Buy More.
emerald and gold.
big Mike, is there a Buy More in Vail?
Yep, there's a Buy More in Vail, and they had a break-in that night. Look.
looks like all roads lead to the Buy More.
I'm never getting out of this place.
wow, the Vail Buy More.
lot of broken limbs on these morons.
I think you can only work here if you've broken something skiing.
Grimes! Remember me, buddy?
ha-ha, sweet! I just tweeted you were back in town.
beers tonight to celebrate, brah!
Oh, yeah, sweet!
he tweeted you're back in town?
if Quinn has been waiting for us to come back and search, then...
we gotta hurry.
I fricking hate Twitter.
hello. Excuse me, Miss... ter.
uh, we're security specialists with Carmichael Industries.
corporate sent us to check out the recent break-in.
bored of you. Talk to Big Michelle.
right.
our security is rock-solid.
I don't understand why Corporate felt we needed to be checked up on.
this isn't any sort of criticism on your store. We just want to do a proper check for your safety.
now, if you could first take us to the manager's vault for a look-see.
Oh, man...
how's a nice security check feel, Casey?
this is about as extreme as it will get in our new job.
nice, easy-peasy last mission.
well, it ain't over. Keep your guard up.
I just don't understand why no one told me you were coming.
I'm gonna have to call and get the go-ahead before I open the vault, obviously.
well, so much for her helping us open the vault.
looks like we're gonna do some safecracking today.
Yeah, well, hold on a second. Maybe not.
let me try something real quick here.
one, two, three, four... boom.
seriously.
I was too lazy to change the code in Burbank, too.
one thing you can always count on: Buy More laziness.
Oh, no.
where else could they be?
maybe somebody moved them.
like, maybe the person who is currently knocked out cold.
the place is hopping right now.
this is the new expansion pack for Gunz 'n Gold.
the vault...
could it be?
okay, well, nice work, Morgan.
let's go. Let's get out of here.
let's go.
you people are spies!
and we are not going to forget it, because it is right here on my arm.
Yeah! What he said!
everybody out!
first guy who got it instead of me.
what are you talking about?
I'm former CIA, too.
the Intersect was supposed to be mine.
but then Larkin stole it for you, so I went back out in the field, and I got captured.
Oh, and tortured...
in a hole the ground, for 378 days.
in a hole!
that was the best.
and then I was broken.
dismissed.
and all because the Intersect wasn't mine.
you don't want it, Quinn.
you do not want it. Trust me.
it doesn't work right, okay?
I lost memories, important movies, a bunch of stuff.
he's right. He's right.
listen, you don't want to trust me.
nothing good can come from it.
take a good look at your wife.
you think you'd get that without the Intersect?
I tried to win without it.
I... I tried.
now give it to me!
Jeffrey... run!
nice shot!
thank you.
no, no, Casey-- Casey, wait.
Quinn didn't get the Intersect. We did it!
we took down his team.
okay, let's call Beckman.
call the authorities. Tell them where he is.
but... let's be done.
can't we just be done?
we survived our last mission.
let's leave behind the Intersect and everyone involved with it, and be done.
okay.
we're done.
okay. I'll call Beckman. Whoa!
I'm not done. No, I am not done.
I would like very much to forget everything
everything that I saw here today.
here we go again.
I'm scarred.
Aw, buddy. - So scarred.
sorry, Casey. Looks like we can't kick the creepy cousin out of the family just yet.
I knew it-- there's no alcohol on your breath.
it's just gefilte fish curry, like always.
I believe we've been set up.
and what's all this?
we must've gotten to the bottom of it, then.
guess we were wrong.
that's kind of disappointing.
so now what do we do?
Hey, boys.
morgan told me you might've gotten stranded.
Yeah, apparently, we did.
cheer up!
I brought turkey BLT Subway footlongs.
from the Fresh Fit menu?
Yep. Watching my weight.
how many you have?
only two.
also, I had a thought. Mm-hmm.
we're already halfway to Vegas... Mm-hmm.
and Bologna's doing some Native American feelings workshop about her period all weekend.
EW. But are you saying...?
Vegas, baby!
Hey. Did I wake you?
no, it's... I mean, yeah, but it's okay.
where are you so early?
I'm sorry, I-I couldn't sleep.
I'm just, uh, I'm so excited about starting everything.
I made an appointment at noon to check out some of these new office spaces, and I thought that we could get Casey and Morgan together and, um... have a little ceremony.
you know, pop some champagne and toast to our futures, and, uh...
destroy the Intersect glasses.
I, um, I-I think that's the right end to this.
Yeah. That sounds perfect.
turns out saying "last mission" wasn't a jinx after all, huh?
I love you, Chuck.
I love you, too, babe. Good-bye.
Bye.
never let the bad guy get away.
I have your husband.
bring the Intersect to the San Pedro docks, Pier 23, 2100 hours, or he dies.
Casey, where is everyone?
you got anything?
Casey, hold your fire. They've got Chuck.
Sarah Walker, put the glasses down.
you show me Chuck first.
situation's changed.
he'll be needed. Now put the glasses down on the ground in front of you.
it was a trap! Where is he?
I don't know! We gotta get out of here!
Casey, you got an exit?
No!
no, not from here.
what's our next move?
I've got one clip left.
Walker, no!
don't do it!
okay, I got this.
Hi, I'm Chuck.
and here's what's been going on in my life, lately.
you wouldn't have downloaded the same version
morgan had, would you?
I know you lose memories when you flash.
No!
who are you?
your handler.
orders are in.
kill Chuck Bartowski.
okay, guys, Sarah's out there.
she's still out there; we need to find her.
Quinn said that he's after the last remaining intersect, which means if we find it, we will probably find Quinn, and with him...
Sarah. - Exactly.
which is why I hacked into the CIA's database.
just stay with me for a little bit, because I found something interesting.
these are the blueprints to DARPA.
DARPA? That's an acronym for something. Give me a minute, I can figure it out.
defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
Morgan, if the CIA had a Q working for them, he'd be working right there.
and I've seen enough Intersect white rooms to know that they have one.
guys, I know this is a long shot, but I have to do something to find her.
I cannot continue to sit idly by and wait.
are you with me?
let's go. - 100%.
I'm... I'm sorry it took me so long to come home.
baby...
baby, what happened to you?
I know you've forgotten a lot, Sarah, but you've been undercover for the past five years, monitoring a rogue spy.
his name is Chuck Bartowski.
everything's in here.
strengths, weaknesses, profiles of the people closest to him.
memorize it.
any questions?
Yeah. Yeah, just one...
why the hell should I believe you?
I'm on your side, Agent Walker.
I don't want to have to hurt you.
and then I threw him out the window.
and that's how I escaped.
what? I can't believe that.
that's nuts, amazing.
and Quinn?
he's dead.
and the Intersect is out of my head. So, it's all over.
well, thankfully, these cuts look pretty minor.
we should let you get some rest.
the sister.
goes by Ellie.
thank you, Ellie.
and you remember her husband's name.
and thank you, Devon.
thank you, all of you. I'm-I'm really glad to be home.
glad you're safe.
me, too.
I don't remember you any more than I remember this Bartowski guy.
so you tell me, what happened to me?
Walker, give me a chance.
there's something you need to see.
this is Agent Sarah Walker.
today is September 24, 2007, Day One.
today, I made contact with the Intersect, Charles Irving Bartowski, or rather, Chuck.
my mission is simple: find out what he knows, gain his trust and monitor his actions until the agency can decide what to do with him.
well, the Agency has made a decision, Agent Walker.
well, then put Director Graham on the phone. He gives me my orders.
he's dead, Sarah.
well, what about my partner, Bryce? Where is he?
I'm sorry, Sarah.
he's dead, too.
that's not possible.
we believe that Bartowski and his team are responsible for both of their deaths.
and I wish I could just let you forget everything horrible that this man has done, but Chuck Bartowski needs to be stopped.
he's a traitor.
and you want me to kill him?
Yes.
but first, I need you to retrieve something that he's stolen from us.
a pair of Intersect glasses.
we believe that Chuck wants to use them to upload a pristine version of the Intersect.
if you want your life back
the life he stole from you
return to Burbank, retrieve the glasses, and put Chuck Bartowski to rest once and for all.
I'm so glad you're okay.
I love you.
I love you, too.
you are...You are really going to town on that thing?
I'm just cutting the chicken up.
you're just getting it...
I'm gonna... I'm gonna make a quick phone call, okay?
love you. Be right back.
I'm alone.
good. Find the glasses.
look for a hidden safe or vault.
be careful, Walker.
do not underestimate him.
he has proven time and again that he is more dangerous than he looks, and remember, the rest of his team is only a few feet away.
different how?
I don't know, Morgan; that's what I'm trying to tell you.
I can't put my finger on it.
Sarah just seems different.
look, of course she's not acting like herself.
okay, she was kidnapped by some homicidal maniac on a Japanese bullet train, and then in order to escape, she had to kill the dude and walk home from his secret base barefoot!
she really is incredible?
Yeah, yeah, maybe you're right, maybe you're right.
maybe I just need to try and make her feel, you know, a little more relaxed.
Yes, yes, untense the tense girl.
loosen up that leggy blonde.
I can do that.
Hey, honey, you want to meet me in the bedroom?
I have a surprise for you.
okay. - Okay.
I think he's up to something.
stay alert.
it could be a trap.
welcome to the Bartowski Inn and Spa Resort where all of your worries melt away.
you have to use a little imagination, but picture, if you will, outside those windows the gorgeous Ojai Valley.
and what may look like a normal, five-year-old mattress is, in actuality, a luxurious massage table.
a sheet has been provided for your discretion.
great.
Walker, what's going on?
he claims he wants to give me a massage, but I think he's onto me.
you almost ready?
just a second!
calm down.
you should use this as an opportunity.
allow yourself to be vulnerable with him.
it'll convince him that there's nothing wrong.
okay.
okay, I'm ready.
all right.
here we go.
starting with the application of the oil.
Ah, yes.
relax, relax.
this would actually go a heck of a lot smoother if you just brought these down to your side, honey.
so, just down to your side.
relax... There we go. There we go.
see? Yes, better already. Breathe. Yeah...
baby, your muscles are so tight, they're hurting my hands.
a lot of lactic acid buildup?
why don't, why don't I crack your neck? - No!
what? What did I, what did I do?
what did I say? You love it when I crack your neck.
don't blow your cover, Walker. Talk to him!
I'm-I'm-I'm sorry, Chuck.
I really appreciate everything that you are trying to do.
it's just that it's been long couple days, and, you know, maybe it's just best if we go to bed.
Yeah. Yeah, sure, sure, sure.
whatever you need.
it's all ending?
what are you babbling about?
I just get nostalgic, you know?
Quinn's dead, Sarah's home safe, so we're done, man. No more missions.
and no more gunplay.
think about it, Casey. Five years.
I went from pipsqueaky sidekick to this.
and you, you were the most cold-blooded sniper in the whole world, and now you're scrubbing our floors.
well, if you would use a plate when you're eating taquitos,
I wouldn't have to scrub the floors, would I?
I'm so glad that Sarah's back.
bill.
social event. Me, too. I don't know what Chuck would do without her.
for you. - For you.
babe... - Babe, I just got a letter from...
Carlos Shuman Medical Center?
in Chicago offering me a research position.
they want me to head up the cardiac division.
they must know we're a couple.
babe, I think we're being wooed by Midwesterners.
I know, I know. We could, we could buy a house.
we could buy a big house.
okay. Are we... are we really considering this?
we've lived our whole lives in California.
we've always said a change would be nice.
I just always assumed I would live close to Chuck.
Yeah, yeah.
but Sarah's back now.
he's okay, right?
Quinn, I found the glasses.
good. Then, it is time to finish your mission.
take out Bartowski.
Chuck just left.
I'm following.
Hey.
Hi. Sorry. Did I wake you up?
no. I couldn't sleep.
how's Sarah?
you'd better come inside.
Thanks.
I don't know. I guess, it's, the little things that are different. You know?
like, her feet get cold at night, so I always put mine on top of hers to keep them warm.
and I know it sounds stupid, but tonight she...
pulled her feet away from mine, and she never pulled them away like that.
Walker, where are you?
Ellie's apartment.
they're talking.
Chuck, it's her first night back.
I can't imagine what Sarah's been through.
she's involved in this, too. What are they talking about?
about me.
I almost lost my best friend.
and now, my wife, and always for the same reason, which is the Intersect, Ellie.
which is why I keep thinking that I need to destroy it for good this time.
what do you mean?
Quinn is dead, yes, but there will always be someone who wants it, and we will never be able to move on with our lives until it is gone.
Quinn, are you hearing this?
he doesn't want to download the Intersect onto the glasses.
he wants to destroy it completely.
I know where the latest version of the Intersect is being kept.
all I need to do is sneak in and plant the virus.
what do you want me to do?
you have to go with Chuck and download it onto the glasses yourself to ensure its protection.
it's up to you to keep it safe.
then you can kill him.
frist, I just want to be alone.
sisterly advice.
I think if you can be safe, then you should do it.
it's what Dad always wanted.
Thanks.
good luck.
get some sleep. - Oh, no.
I'm cold.
so that's how I figure we'll infiltrate DARPA headquarters.
once we're in the white room, I'll boot up their system.
Sarah, you'll plant the virus using this, and we'll destroy the Intersect, once and for all.
that seems a little drastic.
Yeah, well, it is drastic, Casey, but think of all the Intersect is responsible for.
my father's death, Volkoff's very existence, Morgan's brain melting,
Sarah...
let's just say, it's been more bad than good.
when my dad found out I had it, he told me to destroy it, and I wish I had.
we'd all be better off.
I'm not gonna miss that opportunity again.
if this is what you want, Chuck, I'm in.
all right, I'm in. - I'm on board, obviously.
I also want to say that I'm really glad that we're having this third last mission, seeing as how I wasn't a part of the other two...
all right, we leave in 20.
Hey, buddy, real quick-- you have any extra tranq darts?
I used all mine up at tranq dart... practice.
Yeah. Actually, Sarah normally keeps an extra clip for me in her bag, so...
no dice, buddy.
she must have forgotten.
Oh, yeah. Don't worry about it.
Hey, Casey, Chuck says you got to let me use your tranq darts.
what is she doing with these?
D. A. R. P. A. HEADQUARTERS
what the...?
three, two, one.
I think we're okay.
let's find the Intersect crew.
we won't have long before they wake up.
look at this place.
it's incredible!
what's under here?
it's like a big silver ghost.
it's creepy.
a cloak of invisibility!
Yes!
you're a wizard, Harry.
Grimes, Grimes, what, are you on a diet?
what are, what are you talking about?
Well,'cause you started to disappear in front of my eyes.
get it? Get it?
Hey, the Intersect room is down this hall. Let's go.
what? What? Sorry, I couldn't hear you.
I'm the headless Grimesman.
headless Grimesman.
it wasn't me. It wasn't me.
it was the one-armed man. You find this man.
go. - You never saw The Fugitive?
five guards.
all right, Team, what's the plan?
let's use some sort of distraction. I think if, you threw like a rock.
let's go.
quite a woman you got in your hands, buddy?
Yeah.

enter PERMITTED
all right, just give me a few minutes to get the system up and running.
all right, got it.
Sarah, you're on.

I'm not sure for how long, though, so upload the virus now.
uploading.
it should have gone through by now.
is there something wrong?
just a second.

drop the gun.
Sarah? Sarah, what are you doing?
drop the gun.
now, I have the Intersect, and you can't destroy it, and you can't hurt anybody else with it.
baby, what are you talking about?
Quinn told me the truth.
Quinn's not dead?
I know about you.
I know what you've done, all of you.
I know everything.
I don't know what's happening right now, but whatever he told you is a lie.
the Intersect is-is...
it's damaged your memory or something, because the Sarah that I know would never do something like this.
baby, please.
it's me.
it's your Chuck.
get the hell out of there, Walker!
don't!
this can't be happening.
it doesn't make any sense.
she attached an explosive to the door.
she could detonate it at any second.
no. No, she wouldn't.
we gotta take cover.
she wouldn't.
Quinn, maybe we don't have to do this.
they're locked inside.
they'll be arrested.
that's not your call.
we gotta get out of here before more guards come.
what just happened?
Sarah, sh-she just...
Quinn must've turned her into thinking that she works for him.
now she has exactly what he's been looking for: the last version of the Intersect.
no, she doesn't.
I switched them out.
what the hell? How'd you do that?
I saw the glasses in her bag before we left.
I didn't want to say anything because I didn't want to believe it.
but deep down, I knew it was true.
my wife never came home.
that was a government facility you just blew up.
and that was a man who deserved to die.
did you get the glasses?
no DATA
these are empty.
they're fake!
that's not possible. I had them on me the whole time.
no one got close to you?
Chuck. Chuck did, I guess.
as I was leaving, he tried to grab me...and, and convince me that our relationship was real.
I guess he must've switched them out then.
this is exactly what I warned you about, Agent Walker.
that's why I pushed the detonator button.
this man is a liar; he is a manipulator.
he's still alive?
I made a mistake.
and I can promise you I will not make the same mistake again.
I will get those glasses back no matter what it takes.
she's not picking up.
of course, she's not picking up, dude! She's evil!
okay, that's a little unfair.
it's the faulty Intersect talking.
it's kind of like what happened with me, only much, much worse.
seeing as how she tried to kill us.
Quinn turned her. We have to consider the fact that maybe she's gone.
how can you say that? She's your friend!
and she's not gone. Not completely anyway.
Oh, yeah? Did his memory come magically back after the Intersect? You know it didn't.
all I have to do is remind her of who she really is.
you know, look, look, I have, I have the glasses.
even if she doesn't remember me, I know that she wanted these.
she tried to kill us, Chuck.
can't pretend that everything is as it was.
otherwise, she's gonna succeed next time.
and I'm not gonna lose you both.
you honestly think that?
she's a trained assassin. She knows where we live, she knows where our families live.
he's right, Chuck. He's right, okay?
what about Ellie and Awesome?
she wouldn't.
come on, come on, come on, come on.
Hey, bro, I'm sorry.
I was just trying to get Clara down for a nap. What's up?
are you okay? Is everyone all right?
Yeah, of course.
thank God.
everyone's at the apartment?
well, no. Ellie just went to grab a cup of coffee with Sarah. Why?
I'm glad we're doing this.
you've been through so much lately.
how are you holding up?
Oh, I'm fine, thank you.
we're all really worried about you.
Chuck's was a wreck.
I can imagine.
Chuck mobile
speak of the devil.
do you mind? I actually have to talk to him.
Hey, sweetie.
so I see you that you switched out the Intersect glasses.
that was a nice move.
should've known I couldn't trust you.
I have some moves of my own.
bring the glasses; come alone. You have 15 minutes.
this is crazy, Sarah. Please.
Oh, Bartowski, if you try anything...
Sarah, what are you doing?
I'm gonna put a bullet between your sister's eyes.
Oh, my God.
I've heard enough. You were right to contact me.
but convince Sarah that you've hidden the Intersect glasses somewhere else.
I'm moving men into place at Regal Plaza.
get Sarah there.
and then what? Have a sniper take her out?
we will do whatever it takes to ensure the safety of your sister while bringing in Agent Walker peacefully.
but, Chuck, you know that what happens in that plaza depends entirely on Sarah.
Sarah, I think that the Intersect may have damaged...
stop talking. I know you're involved.
you okay?
you got the glasses?
I don't have them with me.
just wait a second, okay?
whatever you think I've done, she didn't do anything. She's innocent.
so I will lead you to the glasses, but just you and me, okay?
please, just let her go.
I'll follow you in a separate car.
she'll come with me.
if I see anything suspicious, I...
well, you'd better hope I don't.
okay, okay. Follow me.
you drive.
regal PLAZA
all right, Bartowski, we have eyes on the plaza.
okay, she's following me, but, Casey, she brought Ellie with her.
don't worry, Chuck. I'll make sure Ellie comes out of this without a scratch.
Sarah... you don't have to do this.
Casey, what if she resists?
Hey, this isn't the Sarah you know.
you were in my wedding. You were at the hospital when my baby was born. We're family.
no, we're not. This was always a mission for me, and today I'm gonna finish it.
Chuck, you listen to me.
she's not in there anymore.
Sarah's gone.
no, she's not.
my wife is not gone.
where are you going?!
so once you get the glasses, what then?
what happens to Chuck?
just stay close.
okay, he's right up there ahead.
if you could remember, if you were still you, you would want me to do anything I could to save Chuck.
you would want this.
want what? - Sorry, Sarah.
Ellie, no!
Oh, God, are you okay? - I'm okay.
what were you thinking?
I was thinking about protecting you.
Chuck, Sarah's trying to kill you.
there's something seriously wrong with her, Chuck.
that's why I'm taking her somewhere that'll help her remember.
agent Walker, what's happening?
Walker, where are you?
what if she doesn't remember?
she's further gone than Morgan ever was, Chuck.
you need to call the CIA.
you need to turn her in.
listen, everyone keeps telling me that Sarah's gone, but she's not. She's right here.
what if it was Devon?
Hey, where are you? Are you okay?
I'm fine, I'm fine, but Chuck isn't.
he just, he just took off with Sarah.
damn it, Bartowski.
John, I know my little brother, and I know where he would take her.
Hi.
look, I know you don't remember me.
I thought maybe you'd remember this, our dream home...
the one you always told me that you wanted.
our relationship was a cover, Bartowski.
always has been.
you're just an assignment.
no, I was an assignment, and then you fell in love with me.
and I know that sounds crazy, and if I didn't know any better, I-I'd say it's crazy, too.
but the fact remains, you fell for me, Sarah, you did.
my job is too make you think that I feel something.
that's what I do best; I lie.
actually, you're not as good a liar as you think you are.
it's true, okay?
our first kiss, not our, not our first cover kiss, but our first, our first real kiss...
was when we were trying to defuse a bomb and we thought we were gonna die, and I closed my eyes and...
I felt you grab me and kiss me.
you kissed me.
and then there was a lot of pretending that it didn't happen and awkward back-and-forth and even dating other people, but one day, one day when I was sure...
that you could never love a nerd like me, you came over...
and I asked you if you loved me.
Sarah, do you love me?
and you, Sarah Walker...
said yes.
and when I asked you to marry me, you didn't even have to say yes because we both knew, we both knew that we'd spend the rest of our lives together.
so, please remember this house and the red door and the white picket fence and the family that we were going to raise together and remember me.
because if you remember me...
then you'd remember...
that a nerdy guy like me who works at the Buy More...could make you happy.
so I'm going to give you a choice right here, right now.
it's up to you.
you can either take a chance on me, and we can start over...or you can take these glasses that you came for and never see me again.
this is real.
you really love me?
with all of my heart.
I'm sorry, I did my job too well.
but I have a mission to finish, and I need those glasses.
no, you can't!
give them to me!
why won't you fight back?
I'm not gonna fight you.
I'm never gonna hurt you.
Sarah, you're my wife!
you can kill me.
I will never hurt you.
I wrote that.
Yeah, you did.
honey, you know we don't...
I know...
but we will... one day, this will all be ours.
and when it is, I would like to always remember this moment.
very good work, Agent Walker.
the glasses?
you've lied to her!
you used her!
you're right.
he's right, I'm not CIA.
and, I suppose I could explain it all to you, but honestly, you're not worth the time.
good-bye, Sarah.
No!
Oh, my God, are you okay?
I'm wearing a vest.
they're coming for you, Sarah.
run.
but... - Run!
he's here.
Where's Sarah?
she's gone.
Sarah's gone.
you're lucky the bullet only hit your vest, bro.
Yes, it's the best news I've heard all day.
all right, all right, I'll get you something for the pain.
thank you.
I lost her, Ellie.
for a split second, it felt like she was starting to remember, but she's gone.
why don't you get some sleep?
I'll be right here when you wake up.
come on.
Thanks.
don't ever leave me.
never.
figured I'd find you here.
you can put the knife down; I'm not here to fight.
what do you remember about me?
your reputation, mostly.
unfriendly, unforgiving and...
unquestioning about your orders.
that's funny.
when we met, people said the same thing about you.
probably why we never got along?
well, if we didn't get along, then why are you here?
I guess Bartowski's made us both a little soft.
Beckman's got a new job for me, but...
these past five years, we changed, you know.
we became friends.
take care of yourself, Walker.
day One. My mission is simple: find out what he knows, gain his trust, and monitor his actions until the agency can decide what to do with him.
day 21.
Chuck came over to my hotel room today and brought me a pizza.
vegetarian, no olives.
I think he's making it his mission to get to know me.
it's sweet.
day 49.
Chuck broke up with me today.
well, Fake... Fake broke up with me, technically.
day 56.
Chuck I was defusing a bomb today, and there was a moment where we were sure we were going to die.
he closed his eyes, and...
I kissed him.
I... kissed him.
day 564.
things are calm for once.
no missions, nothing... nothing really to report, except I still find myself sitting here, talking to myself, because...
because I love him.
I love Chuck Bartowski, and I don't know what to do about it.
you sure you don't want to spend the night?
you're more than welcome.
I'm gonna have to go home eventually.
tonight is as good a night as any, I suppose.
okay.
well, I'm coming over bright and early, and I'm making you pancakes.
night, sis.
love you.
love you, too.
I-I just wanted to tell you that I believe you.
I believe everything that you told me about us.
but... the truth is, Chuck, I...
I don't feel it.
everything that you told me about us and our story--I just...
I don't feel it.
right.
right, of course, I...
I don't know what I was expecting, you know?
so, what are you doing here, then?
well, I wanted to say sorry for everything that happened today.
but, most of all, I wanted to say good-bye.
where are you going?
Quinn took away my life, and I have to...
well, I have to go find him.
Bye.
Bye.
well?
I'm sending you the code. Yes, I see that. Thank you.
what about my account? Delivering.
I just sent it. You should have it.
Yes. Thank you. Hey, are you sure this is legal?
we're just running a test on our security system, sir. It's fine.
you've got a sexy voice. Is there anything else I can do for you?
to you? We have all we need.
we're ready.
yo, guess who just made 50 Gs today.
What'd you do to my drive? I didn't touch it.
this isn't cool. Don't ever, ever touch my computer.
diagnostics show no damage, but this was an intentional breach.
we were hacked? It wasn't "Denial of Service" level, but they definitely cracked our door.
OK. Open the Black Hat files.
I want every hacker in the country who could have done this interviewed now.
sir, that's close to 1, 000 names.
this holiday weekend we're short-staffed as it is.
we're the ones supposed to keep this from happening, and it happened to us. Do it.
sir, it's night. They're all over the country.
get local law enforcement help.
somebody out there thinks they can screw with us. I wanna find out who.
Jim! I said no. Lucy, you're killin' me, all right?
get out! What?!
get out of the car now! Don't touch me.
no means no. What are you doin'?
John, stop it! Don't call me that. I hate it when you do.
you know this guy? Just shut your mouth right now.
dad! Stop it. I mean it.
"dad"? You said your dad was dead. What?
you told this jerk-off I was dead? You actually said that?
I may have exaggerated a little bit.
and this guy's what? Your boyfriend?
no. Yeah.
I don't know, OK? I'm sorry. We'll see.
what are you doing here?
you don't answer your phone, return calls.
because I'm not talking to you.
why aren't we talking this time, Lucy?
why not? What? You want a list?
how about stuff like this: You spy on me, you drag my boyfriend out of the car...
you said he's not your boyfriend. He's not!
I thought you said I just was. Shut up.
you are such an asshole.
OK. I'm sorry I pulled your "not-boyfriend" out of the car, OK?
Lucy, baby, get in the car. Let's go. No, no.
will both of you go away? Just talk to me.
I'm tired. I'm going to bed... alone.
damn right you're going to bed alone.
Lucy, honey, wait a minute. I wanna talk to you. Just wait.
dad, when I wanna talk to you
if l wanna talk to you
I'll call you.
Lucy. Wait, Lucy. Lucy!
Lucy McClane. It's not McClane. It's Gennero.
chicks, right?
I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go.
John?
John? It's Sclavino.
go for McClane. What are you doing at Rutgers?
how do you know where I am?
our cars were LoJacked four years ago.
I'm staring at exactly where you are.
sir, that's not something I would turn on.
Yeah, we did that. John, we turned them on.
listen, the feds have called in a favour.
they're doing a sweep. They want us to pick up some computer hacker in Camden.
last name: Farrell. First name: Matthew.
whoa, whoa. Camden? What are you telling me this for?
just came in. Vino, it's 3 am. I was on my way home.
send a jughead from the Academy. They'd be happy to do it.
I can't just send in a uniform.
the feds demanded a senior detective.
the kid's a high-value subject- I don't know.
just pick him up, escort him to the Hoover Building in DC.
they had some kind of a computer breach there this morning.
great!
all right, give me that information. Give me that name again. What is it?
you owe me one, Jack.
what?
Aw, come on.
God damn it.
who is it? NYPD. Open the door, please.
Hi. NYPD?
OK. Oh, I get it.
don't worry, everyone gets lost around here. Glad to help. Take...
Hey, I'm not lost. Are you Matthew Farrell?
no. He, uh... actually does not live here any more.
course not. Who are you? My name is Daisy Duke.
got a lot of shit for it when I was a kid. Please don't add to it.
can I see some identification, please? Yeah, sure.
Oh, "Detective"!
Yeah, that looks real!
you get that at Toys "R" Us? Looks great.
then of course... Yeah. That... actually looks pretty good.
Farrell! Sully PDL-ed the new copy of the Kill Zone Nine.
wanna check it out?
No! Thanks, though, man. And good luck at the Bad Timing Awards.
open the door.
shit.
can I get you something? Coffee? A warrant?
what's this about? I don't know. Some computer thing.
DC feds wanna talk to you, so let's go.
feds, huh? Yeah. The feds.
I've been White Hat for four years, but once you're on that goddamn list...
such a pain in the ass.
you play with dolls? Huh?
could you not touch that? Like a GI Joe?
no, it's not. It's a limited edition...
that supposed to come off? No, but it's more valuable broken, so thanks for that.
Krazy Glue. I'm sure it's very important.
I got some other cool shit you can break.
let's go, OK? Come on. I gotta power down my gear, OK?
more dolls. Not spending a whole lot of time with the girls, huh?
Hey! Are you really trying to escape?
Ow! Jesus, don't shoot!
get down!
Jesus Christ. Stay right there.
go!
let's go. Come on. Low, low! Stay down!
Agh! Come on.
it's all right. Stay low, all right? Stay down.
you stay with me, all right? Here we go. OK.
OK.
that'll wake the neighbours.
get down! Get inside!
they're back in the room! They're back in the room!
are you nuts? Get outta there right now!
I'm trying to... Now!
get back in there!
Aaargh! Argh!
get ready to run.
what the hell was that? What?
did you do that? No.
shit. I didn't do that. Come on.
shit. Stay close. The whole apartment's on fire.
come on. Let's go. Come on, let's go, god damn it!
come on.
watch it. Slow it down.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Hey, let's go. Come on.
come on, come on. Stay close.
stay with me. Stay with me.
come on, let's go. Stay close.
get in the car. Go, go.
kid, can you reload a gun? What? Me?
can you reload a gun?! I...
open the glove box and get a magazine out right now!
grab the gun from the back seat!
you OK?
get your head down.
Jesus! Is the circus in town?
did you see that? Yeah, I saw it. I did it.
Camden base, 10077. Come back. Camden base, 10077.
go ahead.
I need to speak to your chief of your detectives. Police emergency, asap.
stand by.
this is Chief Detective Wiesman.
this is Detective John McClane, NYPD.
police emergency. I wanna report a police shooting in your jurisdiction.
yeah? What's the status?
wait one.
Thomas. We had a problem in New Jersey. Farrell's still alive.
so he got away. Yeah.
I did send five of you, is that right?
I'm sending a chopper. Get airborne and we'll track 'em down. Think you can handle that?
Oh, my God. Just breathe.
I am breathing! I'm-I'm... I can't stop shaking.
it's the adrenaline. You're just scared. It'll pass.
Yeah, I'm scared! Weren't you scared, back there?
Yeah. I was scared.
Really? This is you being scared?
I don't know, cos you seem really calm.
have you done stuff like that before?
stuff like what? Like killing people.
Yeah. But not for a long time.
so who were those guys, huh? Why were they trying to kill you?
why did they blow up my goddamn apartment?!
they were there to kill you.
why would they want to kill me? You tell me, kid. You're the criminal.
we got seven dead hackers so far, none of whom were high on our list.
get the hard drives, start sweepin' 'em. Yes, sir.
Trey. Matthew Farrell, find him for me.
on it.
what's with all the guns?
operational prudence.
think of them as hardware to your software.
good morning, DC!
it's shaping up to be a beautiful Fourth of July weekend.
if you've got any big plans, get started early, cos the traffic is ramping up.
so here's another golden oldie for all the commuters out there.
what? What... What...
what are you doing? What is that?
it's Creedence. Creedence?
Creedence. Creedence Clearwater Revival? Classic rock?
I know who it is. It's old rock. Doesn't make it classic.
what sucked then sucks now. You don't like Creedence?
this is like having a pine cone shoved in my ass.
OK. Really? Wow, that's mature.
come on. I'm cooperating with you.
we're at a heading of 060. Making another pass.
listen up, everyone. Are we ready?
transportation hubs are prepped and set.
begin stage one.
what? Nothing.
When'd you last turn on the radio and listen to popular music?
just give me a decade.
the '70s? I'm guessing.
was Michael Jackson still black?
pearl Jam. I'll go back ten years with you. Ten years.
20 years. The Cure? Nothin'?
it's called news radio.
I want to see if your friends from Camden made the headlines.
hold on. You listen to the news?
you got a problem with the news now?
Yeah. I got a big goddamn problem with the news.
ready for this? The news is completely manipulated.
everything you hear, every single day, is designed by corporate media to do one thing only: To keep you living in fear.
Oh, fear? Total fear.
so you'll go out and spend money on things you probably don't even need, so advertisers keep buying ads on their stations.
I'll tell you one more thing.
I'll do this all day. I got days of data at home...
Hey. I'll drop a bomb on you...
Hey! What?
shut up. That's good. Be dismissive instead of...
you all right? No, I'm not all right!
just stay in the car. You'll be all right.
Hey, man. Hey.
you all right? Don't move. Just call 911, all right?
OK.
Jesus Christ.
all the lights are green. Huh?
all the lights are green. Let's go. Right now.
we gotta go? Get your bag, hack-boy. Let's go.
let's go. I've never been in a car accident.
well, it's very exciting. This way, come on.
you been in a car accident? Yeah.
what are we doing?
it's a little thing they invented in the '60s called jogging.
you're gonna love it.
sir, Chicago's reporting a systems crash on the el train network.
Amtrak is flashing a level-one crash in their com system.
FAA just issued a critical alert. Their ATC net just went down.
we're under attack.
OK, let's get 'em outside for a little fresh air.
that's the anthrax alarm.
all right, everyone out. Now! Now!
Taylor, move! Go! Move!
all personnel must evacuate and proceed to the transportation shuttles immediately.
this is not a drill.
all personnel must evacuate and proceed to the transportation shuttles immediately.
we need you inside, sir.
take your team. I want men on the fourth floor, got it?
masks on.
we gotta know what's there.
run a trunk search on these data crashes, try to ID the point of origin.
begin stage two.
Hey, what's going on?
they're already starting to panic.
of course they are.
they think that someone's taking their money.
all those nickels and dimes they saved had meaning.
"useful idiots," as Lenin would say.
prep the video package.
DC transportation system's crashing and they just hit the financial sector. All of it.
get me the secretary for trans and treasury on the line and the chairman of the SEC.
let's go, people.
somewhere somebody left a digital fingerprint. Find it.
deputy Director Bowman in here? Not now. It'll have to wait.
not today. This is Matthew Farrell. I brought him here on orders from Bowman.
if you don't know what's goin' on, find somebody that does.
I'm Bowman.
video package is ready for upload.
John, I appreciate your bringing Farrell, but we are neck-deep in damage control right now.
excuse me. I'm sorry, sir. Do you have anything to eat, any snacks around?
I'd love... I've got really low blood sugar...
sir? No?
as if the transportation breakdown and anthrax scares weren't enough for one day, the stock market found itself in a selling frenzy.
the FTC believes this panic might have been triggered by a computer malfunction in the stock exchange.
Oh, man, that is all bad.
it's not as bad as it looks.
we run drills to prepare for things like this.
these your suspects? Were.
all seven were killed in the last 24 hours.
recognise any of these people?
no.
not one?
sir, we got a system error.
my fellow Americans... ...it is time to...
strike... fear... into... the hearts of... citizenry.

and a... happy Independence Day... to everyone.
that was creepy.
I tried to find more Nixon.
think they bought it?
Absolutely.
OK, I want telecom, transportation...
Jesus Christ, it's a fire sale. What?
it's a fire sale.
Hey. We don't know that yet.
it's a myth, anyway. It can't be done.
it's a myth? Really?
please tell me she's not in charge of anything.
what's a fire sale?
it's a three-step systematic attack on the entire national infrastructure.
step one: Take out transportation. Step two: The financial base and telecoms.
step three: Get rid of all the utilities - gas, water, electric, nuclear...
anything that's run by computers, which today is almost everything.
that's why they call it a fire sale - everything must go.
Hey, listen... What's your name? Farrell?
keep your voice down, OK? No one here's talking about a fire sale.
not unless you're telling me you helped plan one.
no, man. I'm just saying...
appreciate your concern. We're on it. Thank you.
you've done a bang-up job so far. What? What?
nothing. I said I understand.
Hey. They didn't send the girl scouts out to get this kid.
they sent professional guys, full tactical gear.
they blew the whole joint up.
now, I don't know this kid, and frankly I don't give a shit - no offence
but somebody wants this kid dead, and obviously it's got something to do with whatever's going on here.
OK. Homeland's interrogating the hackers we're bringing in.
I'll get you an escort over there. All right?
Molina, get this kid to the front of the line. I wanna know what he knows.
if he knew half the shit I know, his head would explode.
special Agent Johnson. We'll take the sedan.
agent Johnson? That's right. Right this way.
great. So is any of that actually possible, what you were saying back there?
is it possible? Look, you take out any one thing, the system can recover.
if you take it all down at once, the system crashes and...
look around, man.
come on. Government's gotta have dozens of departments dedicated to that shit.
it took FEMA five days to get water to the Superdome.
how long till we get to DHS?
Laughlin, get on the DC police band and get 'em to clear a route to DHS for us.
DC Metro, this is the FBI requesting you to clear a route...
Farrell just resurfaced on the grid.
feds are taking him to Homeland. Good.
close that loop, now. Isolate the frequency.
get us a location on the vehicles and pull me up a file on this John McClane.
rand, we just found Farrell. Stand by for a location.
I don't mean to harp, but we just passed another Arby's, and I'm starving.
I could eat a wrapper. Shut up.
I could just get some ketchup packets. Shut up.
you got about 14 minutes to tell me why you lied to me.
lied to you? What are you talking about?
the pictures on the wall - you knew those guys.
I don't... Kid, don't lie to me.
I'm a cop. I can tell you're lying. Who were they?
OK. OK, OK.
they were my competition.
make the next right onto Concord.
they said they'd developed a mutating encryption algorithm and they wanted to see if it could be cracked.
that's what I do. I do math-based security.
here's the thing. To pull off something as massive and crazy as a fire sale, you need tons of guys to write programs, but only a few Black Hats to implement it.
at that point the start-up guys, who haven't really done anything wrong, like me...
would end up as pictures on some guy's wall.
I swear to God, McClane,
I swear to you I had no idea I was gonna be...
an accessory to Armageddon.
take the next left at Lexington.
and that's a sexy voice. What's she taking us this way for?
unit 510. Oh, my God.
clear a route for two FBI vehicles approaching on Concord.
copy, dispatch.
that's her.
her who? What are you talking about?
it's them. You're saying it's them them?
I swear to you I know her. I would know her voice anywhere.
no, don't say anything... Just keep your mouth shut for a minute.
Hey, Metro, how's your day goin' over there?
gotta be pretty crazy over there, what with all those 587s, huh?
Yes, sir. We've had to dispatch all units.
you had to dispatch all units for all the naked people walking around?
cut the bullshit, honey, and just put your boss on.
Laughlin, we're getting off this route. Turn left on 14th Street.
officer McClane. It's Detective McClane, asshole.
don't worry. We'll have plenty of time to get to know each other when I visit you in prison.
but, John, I already know so much about you.
your address in Brooklyn, the payments on your mortgage, how long you've been a member of the NYPD.
and how's Holly?
Oh, that's sad. You're divorced.
was that tough on little Jack and Lucy?
now, this is sad.
after 30 years I thought you'd have a better pension plan annuity.
Oh, and it gets worse.
your 401k no longer exists.
tell you what. Let me make it up to you.
box them in at that intersection.
shoot Mr. Farrell in the head and drive away, and by the time you reach the end of the next block all your debts will be wiped clean and your children will be set for life.
now, that really is tempting, especially that last part, but I think I'm gonna have to pass, jerk-off.
John, you're a Timex watch in a digital age.
you're gonna lose.
Yeah, well, the other thing that could happen is I could come and find you, kick your ass and throw you out of your own party. What about that?
hold your position.
he's not responding.
get down! Get right down!
just stay down!
officers down at the corner of Main and Constitution.
officers down!
come on, come on, get out! Let's go!
God damn it! Just stay down!
get down! Just hang on!
base, we've got a squad car under fire! We need backup!
this is base. We're sending backup.
just brace yourself.
hang on.
hang on.
we lost the tail. Stay with them.
they're back. I know.
take the tunnel. Left!
God, what are you... Oh, God!
bring up the schematics on that tunnel.
the tunnel!
open the gates on the north side entrance.
redirect traffic to occupy all lanes.
now open the other side. What?
move!
hang onto something.
Hey! Don't get out of the car! Hey! Don't...
just stay there! Stand still!
run. Run!
Oh, God!
don't hesitate like that again.
can you help me get my wife...
you all right? Yeah, yeah.
you OK? I can't move my arms!
just stay here. Stay right here for a minute. What?!
it can't be a uniform, John. No.
get over to the wall, sir! "Feds called in a favour.
all you gotta do is go pick up a kid down in Jersey, drive him down to DC.
how hard can that be, huh? It can't be that hard, can it?
no, gotta be a senior detective.
think a traffic jam, throwing a car at me's gonna stop me? Huh?
rand, get in there and get it done.
this is not a good idea.
don't touch me, don't touch me. OK, sorry, sorry.
are you OK? Oh, my God!
pretty lucky shot, huh? Oh, yeah, lucky. That was...
you just killed a helicopter with a car.
I was out of bullets.
how you doin'? I skinned my knee, my asthma's acting up...
whatever. Yeah, I'm fine.
give me a hand. Don't jump outta cars.
rand, check in.
what about Farrell and McClane?
come back in.
OK, we're moving on. Begin stage three.
I just spoke to Emerson. The team's arriving at Woodlawn now.
very good. Mai, get ready for the downloads.
ID, sir.
park behind the transpo. We'll lead you in.
man the gate. You're with me.
anthrax alarms only went off on five floors.
below that you'll need DOD clearance.
I don't know why you'd need to go further.
there's nothin' down there but servers.
go again. Rodriguez! I didn't copy.
gate secured. Copy.
OK, we are in.
this is insane.
Hey! Hey, this is absurd.
man, there's tough and there's stupid. You gotta go to a hospital. Look at you.
I'm not a doctor, but you're hurt.
Yeah. Sexy, right? No!
come on.
we don't need a doctor. We need the cops.
he's in.
get outta the way! Make a hole, please. Come on.
watch out! Excuse me! Excuse me! Come on.
NYPD. All right?
I got this kid. Come on. Let's go, kid.
excuse me. Thanks.
NYPD. NYPD.
coming through.
sergeant?
sergeant! I need to speak to you.
the medic's in the back.
I'm all right. NYPD. I need to talk to you.
just give me a minute.
sergeant!
Oh, my God.
let's get outta here.
we're a go.
launch the downloads.
nothing's happening. Be patient.
I don't know. It's not responding. Wait for it.
see? There you go.
tell me when the download reaches 20%. OK.
I need you to please remain calm.
excuse me.
excuse me! Thank you. Holy shit.
kid? Kid, hey! Yeah, yeah.
you got a phone in that bag? Yeah.
come on. Let's go.
and here you go, Agent... Tovarek. Guess that's you.
Download's at 20%. Time to move.
let's keep them chasing their tails.
due to recent activity, law enforcement agencies are being cautious.
they are telling drivers to abandon their vehicles until they are searched.
and, as you can see, canine units are checking each vehicle.
whether this is connected to the anthrax reports we heard earlier or a new terrorist threat, we do not know...
FAA just grounded all flights. Good.
we have complete access over networks - phones, power grids, water, nuclear.
Hey, excuse me. Jack Parry, NSA.
Chuck Summer, DHS liaison. White House made the call.
anything you need, we're here to help. Help? Wow, that's great.
we're gonna need some work space for our people. What can you do for us?
as you can see, we're using the space, so you guys can stand in the corner and... liaise.
if I need something, I'll just wave to you.
wait! No, don't call. What are you talkin' about?
they probably cracked that hours ago. They could trace us. Put it away.
you sure? Yes.
or... smash it. You didn't have to smash it.
excuse me. It's a police emergency. Hey!
he'll call you right back.
here, right in here. Come here.
you got a signal? Yeah.
Yeah. This is John McClane for Agent Bowman.
sir, John McClane is on the line.
McClane, go. We never made it to DHS.
they came after the kid again. All your men are down.
what about Farrell? I got him with me right now.
sir? Hang on, John.
Yeah, I'll hold on.
another day in paradise.
they just swarmed into everything - the telecom system, phones, cells, satellites.
they're blanketing every station.
can you put the news back on? This is the news. It's on every channel.
been this way for a few minutes now.
Oh, my God.
McClane!
look out.
look out!
look out.
Bowman? Bowman, do you see that?
Bowman, it's a fake.
I see it.
thank God.
Oh, shit.
McClane? Bowman!
satellite's down. Get me a land line.
I wrote one little piece of code and the world falls apart.
this is virtual terrorism.
what? You know, it's crazy.
the first time I heard of the concept of a fire sale
I actually thought it would be cool if anyone ever really did it.
just hit the reset button and melt the system just for fun.
Hey, it's not a system. It's a country.
you're talkin' about people, a whole country full of people, sitting at home alone, scared to death in their houses, all right?
so finish your nostalgic moment and think a little bit and help me catch these guys.
just help me. Just put yourself in their shoes.
come on. If this were your fire sale, what would be your next move?
OK, uh, well, the whole point of a fire sale is that it's mostly done by remote, right?
but not everything is run completely online. Major utilities aren't.
they're run by closed circuits, so you could breach the security, but to shut it down you'd have to physically go there. You'd have to show up.
and, uh...
give me that guy's PDA. Phones are all dead.
no, it's the network that's dead.
I've just gotta reprogram it and link it into the old Satcoms.
hackers surf 'em all the time. Probably what these guys are using to talk to each other.
how do you know all this stuff?
dude, I don't know. There's a lot rattling around up there. I couldn't tell you.
OK. National power grid.
gas and electric is divided into three zones - Eastern, Central, Western
each with a primary hub.
here it is.
what are we looking at? That is the Eastern hub.
now, they take this out, wipes out all the power for the entire Eastern Corridor.
but, again, you'd have to do it manually.
OK. Come on. Let's go. What? To West Virginia?
I honestly don't think I can handle any more people trying to kill me. McClane!
you get used to it. McClane. Oh, shit.
sir, wireless networks are down and I think they're hitting the land lines, too.
I don't care how, you find me a line.
come on, what you got?
we swept the building. Seems clean.
we can sweep it again... Don't bother. Don't bother.
it's a fake. This guy's playin' us.
OK, get everyone back inside the crisis centre now.
OK, let's open it up!
come on, get in. Door's locked.
unless you have an extra gun I can use to unlock it.
Hey. Hey, don't do that! You're gonna disable it.
Jesus Christ!
that was crazy. Did you see that?
sorry about that, man. I didn't know it'd come out so fast.
man, this is a pain in the ass. How'd you do yours?
you all right? What? Did it hit you a little bit?
sorry.
no, please don't touch those, OK? I know what I'm doing. I've done this before.
I mean, I've read about it.
road Assist. We've detected an air-bag deployment.
yes... Please, we just hit a tree and my... my dad is having a heart attack.
I think he's gonna die. You need to help us.
hold while we contact emergency services.
no, no! He's dying! I can get him to a hospital.
I can drive. I'm fine.
but I can't really turn the key, so you gotta start the car for us, OK?
please, Dad...
your name, please? I'm...
my name is... Frank, and my dad's name is, um... is...
Dvorak... Tsajanski.
please... Please, just help us. We need your help. Please.
emergency services are on their way.
no, no, listen to me. Ma'am, what is your name?
Dolores. Dolores?
OK, Dolores, I don't know if you have a dad, but I do, and I wanna be able to say that a year from now.
because my dad is my hero, and right now he is in my arms dying, and his only hope is to get to a hospital right now. We can't wait.
so please start the goddamn car!
thank you, Dolores.
pass the PDA. I gotta call the Warlock.
the what? The Warlock. A digital Jedi. He's amazing.
ma'am, you're not authorised to be here. FBI. We suspect a security breach.
you can't land here without authorisa...
that was pretty good back there, kid.
Thanks.
what's the matter with you? Nothing else to complain about?
no. I'm just...
well, what? What's the matter you? I'm not like you. I can't do this shit.
what's that mean? Like what?
I'm not, like, heroic and everything. I'm not brave like you are.
I'm not that guy. I'm nobody's hero, kid.
you've saved my life, like, ten times in six hours.
just doing my job, that's all.
know what you get for being a hero? Nothing. You get shot at.
you get a little pat on the back, blah-blah-blah. Attaboy.
you get divorced.
a wife that can't remember your last name.
your kids don't wanna talk to you.
you get to eat a lot of meals by yourself.
trust me, kid, nobody wants to be that guy.
then why are you doin' this? Cos there's nobody else to do it right now.
if there was somebody else to do it, I would let them do it.
but there's not. So we're doin' it.
and that's what makes you that guy.
thing's flying now.
contact Emerson. Tell him we'll be there soon.
what the hell are you doing? This whole floor's restricted acc...
all right, come on.
we're in. Good. Shut it down.
guess you were right, kid.
OK, that's... awful.
we got company.
how would they shut down a power grid? What?
come on. Uh... Central control room. OK...
uh, fourth floor. Fourth floor. Come on.
you take the right.
Oh, shit.
Shh.
can we stop for... Try to keep up.
I am! I just wanna stop for two seconds to catch our breath.
you know, they have these things called gymnasiums.
come on, let's go. Let's go.
intel's fairly certain the terrorists are mobile.
it's the only way to avoid signal triangulation.
with the amount of hardware they're running, we're probably looking for a large vehicle, most likely a semitrailer rig.
all right. Tell the guys at Homeland Security we need every agent, satellite and functioning network they got. Now.
play time's over, sweetheart.
don't.
take your hand off the gun. Hands up.
stand up.
go on. Now!
let's go, kid. You're up.
OK...
as fast as you can.
Jesus!
that's enough of this kung fu shit.
I've known some bitches in my day, but you are maybe the...
still awake, huh?
just keep doin' what you're doin'. OK.
how much time do you need? Um... Not much.
are you done? I, uh...
are you done? No, not quite.
what? I'm not exactly checking my email here.
they used VM mode, so I'm isolating their API and booting the host.
What?! It means about 30 seconds, OK?
not the easiest thing to do when...
OK...
undo everything you just did. Now!
OK. OK. OK.
I'm a righty, I'm a righty. I need my other hand, I really do.
I'm a righty.
one last door to open.
do you know what you're doing? Do you realise what this'll do to the country?
Yes, I do. Now open the door.
OK, good. Glad we're on the same page.
you do? I'm glad you know.
how you doin'?
hang on.
listen, let's just talk about this for one second.
how you doin'? That's not too tight, is it?
damn it!
smile pretty!
McClane!
shit.
McClane, get out of there!
come on, man! Come on!
come on, man.
did you see that?
so you stopped it, right?
you know, a gun to your head makes it harder to do this kind of work.
what? I know that comes as a surprise.
can't you just turn it off? Lock 'em out?
I'm not sure.
I might be able to slow 'em down, though.
WESTERN and Central hubs are ours.
we're just waiting on Mai's end.
hang on. Something's up. All the security's reactivating.
I think someone might be in the market for some cheap Viagra.
now your girlfriend's dead, why don't you check out our sexy singles?
it's an e-bomb.
hey...
all right, wait, wait.
mai, talk to me. What's going on? Mai?
Oh, yeah. Little Asian chick, likes to kick people?
I don't think she's gonna be talking to anybody for a really long time.
last time I saw her, she was at the bottom of an elevator shaft with an SUV up her ass.
what's the matter? Cat got your tongue?
listen, jackass. Your fire sale is over.
just pack up your little circus or I'm gonna come and I'm gonna kick your ass.
you have no idea who I am or what I'm capable of.
when I'm finished here and I promise it'll be soon.
I will focus all my attention on you.
you wanna make things personal, fine.
reroute every cubic foot of natural gas in the pipelines to that station.
can you get Bowman on this thing?
sure. I can get anyone on it.
do it.
now? Yeah, now.
please, no.
it's Thomas Gabriel. Shit.
you know this guy? I worked with him.
he was DOD's chief programmer for infrastructure security.
after 9/11, he's the guy that toldJoint Chiefs the system was vulnerable.
he wanted an overhaul, but they wouldn't listen. Gabriel's not people-friendly.
you think so?
when he tried to go public, they crucified him.
destroyed his reputation, froze assets. After that he disappeared.
we got a pretty serious problem.
hold on one minute. What?
I think we need to get out of here right now.
they're sending the gas lines here.
gas lines? What gas lines?
Christ.
Oh... all of them. See that, those flashing arrows? That's not good.
all that's coming here? Yeah. I think we gotta go.
listen, I gotta go. Just find Thomas Gabriel.
McClane? McClane?
let's go. Finish this up.
right now. Finish it up, come on! Let's go!
get in there!
you OK?
let's go. We gotta get outta here.
what is the point? Man, what is the point?
Hey, knock that off, come on.
this has something to do with that code you wrote for them.
think. Come on, help us win.
win? When do we start winning? Huh?
look around. Are you out of your mind? Does it look like we're close to winning?
we just got the shit kicked out of us!
you think I'm holding out on you?
if I knew what they wanted,
I would tell you! I would happily tell you!
Jesus.
the Warlock. The Warlock.
Oh, great. Ah! There goes the cellphone.
they knocked satellites out of the skies? No, your battery ran out.
we should go see him. - Who?
the Warlock. We should drive to his house in Baltimore.
can't go to the Warlock's house now. - Hey! This is me helping you.
OK? Trust me. We gotta go see the Warlock.
that's our only hope.
how do you feel about flying?
uh, about what? Like, with a pilot?
just stick it in the round thing. What brown thing?
here, put these on.
just stick it in there. That'll work.
you OK? Uh, yeah, I'm just kind of afraid of flying.
I used to be terrified of flying. Really?
Yeah. I took some lessons. Face your fears, that kind of thing.
yeah? Did it help? Not really.
is it supposed to make that sound? Yeah.
maybe we should just drive. Take it easy. Taking off's the hardest part.
Really? I heard...
to be honest, I missed a couple of classes. Ha, ha, ha! You did? Really?
but you have your licence, right?
I mean, you can fly one of these things?
Oh, God. Hey-hey, here we go! We're up.
Oh, God.
that's good. That's pretty good.
Jesus, look at that. This whole area's blacked out.
how we gonna find Warlock's house?
um, it's probably gonna be the one with the lights still on.
power outage keeps spreading. About half the East Coast has already gone down.
all right. Put everything on emergency generators.
how the hell are they getting past us?
OK. Down there, down there. I see it.
down there? - Left. Down.
what? Are we gonna land down there?
all right, hang on. OK, OK. Ohhh!
fence. Fence. Fence!
fence. Fence! I see it.
watch...
Oh, Jesus. Come on.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. "Taking off's the hardest part."
let's go.
now, there's something you need to know about Warlock. He hates cops, OK?
so just let me do all the talking, OK?
shit.
Hey, Mrs Kaludis.
um, is Freddy home?
I'm Matt Farrell and this is, uh...
Billy.
we're friends from Space Camp.
I went to Space Camp with Freddy.
Freddy!
Freddy? You got company!
Frederick! Didn't you hear me?
all Baltimore heard you, Ma.
your friends are here. Friends? What the?
come on, Ma! How many times I gotta tell you, don't bring people down here?
I can't see too good. Is that a young, bearded Han Solo?
you've lost so much weight!
no, I gained 30 pounds. Who is that? Know what? Doesn't matter.
dude, what are you doin' here?
cuz of you, I'm rocking five generators to stay online.
and since you're being hunted by assassins, this visit is not a healthy use of my time.
and hey, don't touch that, all right?
CB radio? A little low-tech for you guys, isn't it?
that, my friend, is an end-of-the-world insurance system, OK?
so when the last microchip goes down, I can contact whoever's there, whether they be zombies or not.
What'd you bring your dad here for?
he's cool. He's into the gaming culture.
nice poster.
Oh, what? Like, you a big fan of the Fett?
no. I was always more of a star Wars guy.
star Wars guy. Who is this man? He's my...
Hey, dump truck. I'm not his dad.
I'm a cop. How 'bout that?
Oh. A cop. I'm sorry. Thank you.
why'd you bring a cop into my command centre?
command centre! It's a basement.
it's a command centre! I can explain.
just tell us about Thomas Gabriel, all right?
that's why we came here.
thomas Gabriel. I didn't know. Sorry.
get out! I want you outta here, right now.
Hey, calm down. Just calm down, big boy!
you calm down! It's my house!
you're gonna tell me what I wanna know, or I'll beat you to death in your own house.
four years ago, the DOD recruits Thomas Gabriel to be a cyberspook for 'em, OK?
first day on the job, tells his bosses this nation's security infrastructure is open to compromise.
they say, "We'll take it under advisement."
but he doesn't ease up cuz he is committed.
so he breaks into a meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and, with just a laptop, hacks into NORAD and shuts down our defence network.
so they put a gun to the man's head and forced him to stop the hack.
thomas Gabriel's the guy who shut down NORAD with a laptop just to prove a point.
you think I'm scared of you? Tell us how to find him.
how do I know? He's a ghost, man. He just fell off the grid.
another dead end. Come on. Wait.
listen, Warlock, a couple of weeks ago I wrote a...
a mutating algorithmic security code, that's probably being used by Thomas Gabriel now.
no, we know that. Yes. Can you tell us what he's using it for?
I don't know. I've been trying to figure that out. Here, look.
the only security system in the country that I can find currently employing that template is the Social Security Administration.
but they don't use it in the main facility.
look. They use it in this building, in Woodlawn.
whoa. What the hell? God! I know, right?
what are you talkin' about? The power consumption's off the charts.
it's hot. It's on fire. Why are there chilling towers?
hello.
what's a chilling tower?
see what I've been dealing with?
large server farms generate a lot of heat and need to be cooled.
but why there?
I don't know what's in that building, but it's not Social Security numbers.
I got a red flag over here! Someone's hackin' into Woodlawn.
honing in on the host server right now.
Frederick Kaludis.
let's have a look at him. Fat bastard.
McClane.
where is his daughter? We just got a trace on her cell.
you'll love this.
all right. Let's get a better look at you.
Freddy? What?
what the hell are you doing dickin'around inside my network?
McClane?
I thought I killed you already.
I get that sometimes.
you think you can try to track where he is? Dude, yeah.
detective, covering the camera with your hand does not turn off the microphone.
Yeah, I know I'm not as smart as you guys with all this computer shit, but, hey, I'm still alive, ain't I?
I mean, you got to be runnin' out of bad guys by now, right? Huh?
Gabriel?
honestly, you can tell me. How does that work?
you got some kind of service? Some kinda 800 number? 1-800-HENCHMEN?
and I bet you're still on hold with, "Can I get another dead Asian hooker bitch over here right away?" Huh?
but seriously, all that kicking aside, that skinny little ninja chick, she was smokin' hot.
one of those gotta be real hard to come by, right?
you're impressed with yourself, aren't you?
I have my moments.
yeah?
is this one of them?
Hello? Yes, this is Emergency Services.
thank God. Can she hear me?
my name is Lucy Gennero. I'm stuck in here.
my cell's not working.
can she hear this? Lucy, hang up that phone!
Yes, calm down, miss. We know exactly where you are.
everything is gonna be all right.
Lucy, hang up the phone! John, I'm trying to have a conversation.
we're a bit overloaded tonight, as you may imagine, but I assure you we're gonna get you out of there.
even if I have to come down there myself. Thank you.
in the meantime, is there anyone we can contact for you?
Yeah.
my dad.
his name is John McClane. He's a New York City cop.
we'll find him. Just hang in there, miss, and we'll get to you very soon.
thank you.
Wow. That's a great girl you got there. Can't wait to meet her.
what's the matter? Cat got your tongue?
come on, John.
make a joke.
say somethin'funny.
where? Where you goin'?
Hey! McClane! Hold on. Where you goin'? What are you gonna do?
what do you think I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go kill this guy and get my daughter.
but she can be anywhere...
listen. It's gonna get messy. Stay here.
I think I... Hey, I'm doing you a favour.
I wouldn't bet on me, all right?
I'll take it from here.
thanks for your help.
I wouldn't bet on you either, so I figured I'd lend a hand.
buckle up.
FBI, ma'am. Jersey field office.
mind if I see your ID?
not at all.
my dad's a cop. Force of habit.
your father sounds like a very smart man.
kid, can you get Bowman?
uh, yeah.
it's completely dead.
Gabriel must have shut down all the satellite links. Shit.
I'm sorry about Lucy, man.
about all of it.
it was my fault you got into this. This wasn't your fight.
you got nothin' to be sorry about.
let go of me, you bastard! This bitch is a handful.
are you gonna be all right?
Hey! Behave or I will hurt you.
Oh, yeah? Let's step outside, just you and me. We'll see who hurts who.
you really are his daughter.
tie her wrists.
Trey, Gabriel wants to see you.
is it that time already? Yeah.
OK.
I'll be back in a second.
no, no, no, please!
we're showing a breach on an exterior vent.
go take a look.
don't be long. We're packing up soon.
Hey, McClane, do we have anything resembling a plan?
find Lucy and kill everybody else.
no, I mean more like a plan. Like, a way to do that.
come on.
OK, according to the layout, the chilling towers are kept on the bottom level.
I think mine's locked.
OK. Now it looks like we're gettin' somewhere.
OK, this looks like it controls the cooling system for the mainframe, which should be...
if I can just hack in...
and trip the alarm, it might alert Bowman.
someone set off the alarms.
Yes. Thank you, detective. I can hear that. Find a way to turn it off.
what have you got?
we got a problem. The alarms went off at Woodlawn.
it's gotta be him.
and what's Woodlawn?
it's NSA - a secure facility outside of Baltimore.
it's a fail-safe we built after 9/11 to back up all financial information.
the moment networks were hit, all financial data began downloading to those servers.
banks, Wall Street, corporate records, government funds, all of it.
basically, a backup for the accumulated wealth of America.
all in one location?
what could Gabriel do with it?
if he could get in, he might try to transfer the data to a portable hard drive.
then he'd have access to those accounts from anywhere. Siphon off billions for himself.
we couldn't trace it.
or, knowing him, he could erase it all and send us all back to the Stone Age.
why the hell wasn't I told about this? Frankly, it's above your pay grade.
my pay grade?
how the hell did Gabriel find out about this when even I didn't know about it?
he designed it.
it was his program.
he knew that hacking your system last night would trigger the download.
that's brilliant.
you two geniuses, stay out of my way.
let me see if I can get a floor plan of this place.
don't move!
you, get away from the bag. Now!
OK. OK.
we've been waiting for you.
yeah? I've been waiting for you, too.
McClane!
McClane!
kid?
Matt?
kid!
Emerson.
we have a problem in one of the cooling towers.
tower seven. Tower seven.
find out what's going on.
Arrivo subito. OK.
sir?
get the HR team to stand by. We need to get to Woodlawn.
the roads out are blocked. DC's in total gridlock.
then get us some helicopters.
they were all pulled by the Pentagon for search and rescue.
Molina, find me some goddamn helicopters immediately.
look, the Pentagon has jets flying CAP over DC.
have them send one to Woodlawn and keep an eye on things.
let's go.
Where's my daughter?
Russo, check in.
Yeah, I think Russo's on his way down to meet your girlfriend, dickhead.
hold on a minute. Looks like he's coming around.
it's McClane! He's on the third floor!
get all that? That's right.
I'm on the third floor. But I'm coming to get you.
don't move now. I'll send a doctor.
kill this guy and I'll give you Mai's cut.
je vous rejoins.
my algorithm.
OK, please, God.
Oh, please, God...
Oh, Jesus, they're going after the money.
you coming to get me, John? Is that the plan?
Yep, that's my plan.
what makes you think I won't put a bullet in your daughter's head?
cuz you're scared of me. You think I'm afraid of you?
otherwise she'd be dead already. You need a bargaining chip.
stop there! Hands up.
if you kill me, you'll never get it open.
Eccoti qui, piccolo stronzo.
move away. Move!
you know, John.
I feel like we've gotten off on the wrong foot.
and because of that, you think I'm the bad guy.
nothing could be further from the truth. I'm the good guy.
I told them this could happen if they didn't prepare.
did I get a thank-you?
no, I got crucified. But they wouldn't listen.
you got their attention now, don't you? That's right.
I am doing the country a favour. By tearing it apart.
better me than some outsider.
some religious nut-job bent on Armageddon.
nobody wants to see that happen.
everything I've broken can be fixed if the country is willing to pay for it.
Ah, bullshit. It's always been about the money.
what? I shouldn't get paid for my work?
I'm working my ass off here, John.
well, just sit tight, asshole. I got a cheque for you.
I can't talk to this guy. You talk to him, see if you can get him to focus.
dad?
Hi, baby.
now there are only five of them.
hang on, Lucy. I'm comin'.
would somebody please kill this son of a bitch?
we have a problem.
there's actually no problem. I just got off on the wrong floor.
this is a mess.
Wow. I'm truly impressed, man. Hacking every byte of financial data for the entire country'd take weeks unless you eliminated the congestion.
that's what this fire sale is about, isn't it?
that's brilliant. Yes, it is. Please be quiet.
asshole. Who are you?
Matt Farrell.
Lucy McClane.
I thought your name was Gennero. Lucy Gennero.
not today.
can you crack the code?
maybe. I mean, if I had enough time.
that's encouraging.
take them with us.
let's go. Let's go.
Gabriel, Pentagon just sent an F-35 towards us.
keep an eye on it.
pulling down the "go" codes now.
you might wanna think about what you want on your headstone, asshole.
Christ. Goddamn hamster!
there you go.
stay still, spider-boy!
that's right.
goddammit!
Oh, no!
you probably shouldn't antagonise them, since they have all the loaded guns.
take a minute and dig deep for a bigger set of balls, cuz you're gonna need 'em.
Wow. I know that tone.
it's just weird hearing it from someone with hair.
sir.
ETA 15 minutes.
there we go.
fix it.
Why? You're just gonna kill me if I fix it. I know that.
Oh, shit.
I'm not gonna do it.
Oh, no, no, no! Shit! Robinson is coming pretty fast.
I'm sorry, what? Something's wrong.
Robinson is coming too fast.
it's not Robinson.
that would be my dad.
Freddy?
Freddy?
it's John McClane.
look, I know you can hear me.
this is your frequency, right? 666.
come on, pick up the mic, Freddy.
nobody here by that name. Sorry.
Hackerjerk-off!
warlock...
I need you to do whatever it is you do to patch me through to the FBI.
to Deputy Director Bowman.
you hear me? Are you serious?
you want me to intentionally open up a com line to the head of the FBI's cyber division? I don't think so.
Freddy, goddammit, they have my daughter!
I can do that. Hold on.
thank you.
this is Central. We have a patch for Director Bowman.
sir. Central's trying to reach you.
go.
Bowman, it's McClane. McClane.
listen to me. Gabriel is on the 695headed north in a Hazmat truck.
wait, Gabriel's left Woodlawn?
we're headed there right now.
Bowman. He's got my daughter.
listen, this Hazmat truck is a government vehicle, so it should be Lo Jacked, right?
track that down, it should take you to him.
give me the tag number. All right. Hang on. Here it comes.
golf... Tango...
five... niner... two... November.
got it. McClane, where is Farrell?
he's with them.
listen to me.
I'm gonna go in there and get Lucy out, but if something happens to me, you gotta send the cavalry in, you hear me? I mean everybody.
don't let that maniac get my daughter.
John, don't worry. I want your word, Bowman.
Yeah, you have it.
McClane out.
there's the F-35.
did you get the "go" codes?
Trey. Did you get the "go" codes? Yes.
can you connect me to the pilot?
uh...
isolating his radio.
sending him the "go" codes.
AV-81, this is Marine Air Wing ATC.
go for AV-81.
confirmed terrorist vehicle located in your sector. A big rig truck.
currently in pursuit of a Hazmat vehicle. I see them.
you are authorised to engage and destroy.
copy that. AV-81 engaging.
what?
Jesus Christ! Goddammit!
you're shooting at the wrong guy!
I don't think Daddy's coming, honey.
Hey! Jackass!
is that it? Huh?
is that your best shot?
come on!
Damn!
come on!
let's go. Come on!
that way. It's that way. Go!
we are leaving in three minutes.
you have one.
the rules haven't changed. You'll kill me the minute I unlock it.
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Matthew?
Matthew!
I really need you to pay attention.
the rules can always change. OK, wait.
I'm gonna shoot her in ten seconds. Wait.
I can't.
I can't.
Oh, God.
OK!
OK. OK. OK!
OK, stop! Stop, stop! I'm doing it. I'm doing it!
Oh, God. Oh, my God.
feds are headed this way.
get everything on the plane. Yep.
dad! Careful.
don't worry, baby. Everything's gonna be all right.
daddy!
No!
hold this.
No!
Jesus Christ.
you got her?
you're sure?
nice effort, though.
Matthew! Oh, shit! All right, OK!
OK! I'm doin' it. I know.
McClane.
would you do me a favour?
I know the lights are beginning to dim, but if you could just hang on for a second, when Matt's finished, I'm gonna kill him and your daughter, and I would love for you to see that.
goddammit. Matthew?
ten seconds, OK? You'll have all your money.
修改后英文译文（请在此列基础上修改）
you just leave. No one has to get hurt, OK? - A few seconds. Stay with me.
McClane!
stay with me.
dad?
on your tombstone it should read, "Always in the wrong place at the wrong time."
how 'bout, "Yippee-ki-yay, motherf... !"
daddy... Daddy... Daddy...
are you OK? Yes, baby, I'm fine.
I knew you'd come for me.
of course I'd come for you, honey. Sorry it took me so long. It's OK.
move, move.
Freeze!
hold, hold! He's OK.
get that vehicle. Come around!
here, help Daddy up. OK.
Oooh! Wait, wait. I think I'll just stay here for a minute.
OK. Daddy, you're outta your mind. What are you talkin' about?
you shot yourself! It seemed like a good idea at the time.
don't tell these guys that I did that.
thanks for all your help, John. Thank you.
is he OK?
should I put my hands up? No, don't put your hands up.
put 'em down further?
might die of shock on the way to the hospital.
all right.
I'll be right back.
how's it feel to be shot? It actually feels great.
he gave me some... What's it called? Mor? Morphine.
well, you got your merit badge now.
Yeah. I don't know what that means.
Plus, you know, chicks dig scars. Really? Hm.
not that one.
what? Don't even think about it.
how did you know what I was thinking? Did she say something to you?
I felt like we had kind of a vibe.
easy. That's just the morphine kickin' in.
Yeah.
besides, after all we've been through,
I'd hate to have to beat you to death.
that would suck.
good to go? Yeah, all set.
take care of yourself. I'll see you at the hospital.
thanks for saving my daughter's life.
what was I gonna do?
that's what makes you that guy.
Yeah.
so, um, did he say anything about me?
Jesus, Lucy.
what? I'm sorry. I'm just asking.
I'm in enough pain already.
hospital.

ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the man who knows what you're going to do before you do it.
the amazing Frank Cadillac!
here's to world peace.
good evening. Welcome to beautiful downtown Las Vegas.
how many people are here from the Orient? Raise your hands.
you, sir. Where are you from?
no, wait! Wait. Don't tell me.
I'm sensing you must have soul.
you're a Seoul man.
why don't you share with everyone where you're from?
korea. - How about that, folks?
and may I assume that this charming young lady is your daughter?
she's my wife! - Well, of course she is!
and what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.
what's your name? - Yong Kyunge.
yong Kyunge.
would you be kind enough to join me up on stage, please?
are you serious about this guy? This a joke?
want me to round up some mimes and clowns while we're at it?
yong Kyunge, what if I told you that that pretty necklace you're wearing has a broken catch, and on my count of three, will fall into your drink?
Wouldrt that be something? Wouldrt that just blow your mind?
Yeah. - Yes!
Wouldrt it blow all your minds?
three, two, one, now.
did somebody say "spooky"?
wait a minute. Look at your glass. Where'd it go?
yong Kyunge, why don't you look inside my pocket?
reach in. Dig deep.
let's have a big hand for Yong Kyunge.
that's magic, folks, and that's why I'm here.
you've probably seen a lot of those shows.
Mentalists. Magicians. Illusionists.
you'd be shocked to know that sometimes, not often, but sometimes, it's the real deal.
masquerading as an act.
hiding behind a few $50 tricks.
hiding in plain sight.
because if the magician doesn't do that, the alternative is impossible for others to live with.
anyway, Wednesday night at the Back Page doesn't pay very well, so I gamble.
but I don't play against other people. Only against the house.
so, no mega-jackpots, no long shots.
the idea is to go unnoticed.
that way, I can keep coming back.
I'm not a god.
I can't see everyone's future.
only my own.
and only within two minutes.
except for when I saw her.
but we'll come back to that.
there's no pattern to this guy. He's all over the map.
