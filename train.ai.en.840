I'll go upstairs. You keep watch down here, okay?
Lucas, are you okay? Were you hit?
no, no, it's my fault, I was startled and the gun just went off!
Oh, Lucas.
take this! And take that!
someone's going to pay for this, right now, or there's gonna be big trouble!
Arghh! Damn it!
you think it's funny, you bunch of idiots?!
Oh, big teddybear, sounds like you're losing your cool!
look what I've brought you as a surprise!
what have we got here?
the little honey pie, all ready for Daddy Costa's cooking pot!
well, you can pride yourself on giving me a real run around, you little pest.
and you, my little flower, thank goodness I've got you!
if I had to count on this bunch of good-for-nothings
I'd still be nicking sweets from the corner shop.
wait a minute... I've just had a thought.
this could solve all our problems.
we may even be able to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.
having the kid is like having the mother!
gentlemen, we're changing tactics.
we're going to make this spectacular, do it in style!
if the mother wants her daughter back, she'll have to give us what we want.
she's going to hand over the Colossus all-included, with a cherry on top.
and with a smile, if you please!
And? - That guy was right.
they've kidnapped her, and it's all my fault.
I got it all wrong!
don't worry, we'll find her. I promise.
I'll alert everyone. We'll start searching immediately.
come on, Jeanne, be strong!
there you are, you filthy creature, always hassling me.
you're a nasty piece of work.
you look at me and think: "I'll have her for breakfast!
well, just you try. I'll be waiting.
I don't sabre champagne bottles, I behead them!
you've got a good aim, boss, well done!
ladies first! Some manners, please!
in any case, a frog that can't swim, doesn't drink champagne.
take the kid upstairs and don't let her out of your sight!
come along, you! You heard the boss!
dolling yourself up all nice, my Doll?
Yes! Just for you, my big teddybear!
Oh no, she's at it again.
more of that disgusting poison!
tell me about it. It gets me right in the throat!
sorry, boss, do you mind if I open the window?
it's terribly hot tonight. - Be my guest...
what's with him?
it's nothing, boss, too much champagne, that's all.
you know, guys, no offence, but I sometimes wonder if you're really cut out to be gangsters.
it's all very well, Cat, but how are we going to find Zoe now?
what's up with you?
have you picked up a scent?
Hey! Wait for me! Wait for me!
you know where I'm taking you when all this is over?
Nairobi! It'll be our honeymoon, sweetheart.
I know a lovely little hotel deep in the bush!
it'll be the most beautiful day of my life!
well, thanks a lot, kid!
now, I can't even go and have fun with the others.
what's going on? Why's the power gone?
can someone tell me why the power's off?
I'm like you now, Cat. I can see in the dark.
maybe it's a power cut. - Or the fuses.
are there any torches here?
I think there's one in the cellar. Hang on, I'll get it.
what's up, Hulot? Have you got a cold?
no, not at all! I thought it was you who...
you think I don't hear you all talking about my perfume behind my back?
you don't dare say anything when my teddybear is there, but you all gossip away like a bunch of girls.
be honest. You think I stink, right?
not at all. Why do you say that?
do I smell good or not? It's a simple question, isn't it?
shut it up, down there!
not a peep until the lights come back on!
well, serves them right for leaving me out of the party like that!
they can drink their bloody bubbles in the dark!
it's me, princess, Nico... I've come to rescue you.
anyway, I'm not a frog.
I don't even like frogs.
and it's not because I can't swim that I can't drink champagne.
you know, it's not easy being a gangster, but it's the only job I know how to do.
I used to work in a cafe.
it's that guy again! He's taking the girl!
come quick! All of you! I've got him.
come and help, I've got him.
me too, I've got him too, it's okay!
but I had him!
dammit, it's you?
Yes, it's me, you idiot!
over there! Something's moving!
what are you doing? You bunch of useless idiots!
blithering fools! Where's the kid?
where the hell is she, dammit!
hang on tight, Zoe!
Co-Cos! Go on, jump!
you've just seen how easy it is!
how right you are! Here I come!
look up there! What are they doing? It looks like a chase!
one of them's got a kid on his back!
they're completely crazy!
Costa did this to you? Are you sure it was him?
what direction did he take?
did you see a little girl with him?
chief, he's wounded, let me talk to him.
are you sure it was Costa, sir?
I recognised him alright, it was your man.
he was with a big chap. He doesn't pull his punches, that Costa.
look what he's done to me. - Hello, I'm listening.
game on! They've spotted Costa.
hurry up! Not a minute to lose!
thank you, sir, get well soon.
right, don't move from here, Zoe.
promise me.
I'll come back for you, when I've dealt with that brute.
it won't take long. At least, I hope it won't.
so tell me, Mr. Muscle Man, is that cat's piss or sparrow fat in those arms of yours?
wanna find out?
come on then, come on! I'm waiting for you.
what a shame, I never got my invitation.
this is your lucky day! No invitation's required!
so, Costa, those keks and their classy low waistline, some kind of artistic statement, is it?
don't make me laugh, it hurts too much!
Oh! Poor little thing. Does it hurt then?
Damn! Nothing's moving. Perfect timing, huh!
not our lucky day.
Superintendent! There's news on Costa.
talk!
there's another guy with Costa up there!
and a little girl, and a cat.
Zoe! It has to be.
what do we do, Jeanne?
take the wheel, I'll make my own way. - But....
you still up here?!
do you need a hand to get down?
or a foot?!
are you going down or what? Down, I say!
too short, old man!
I'm sure you'd be less nasty, if you weren't so short.
you want to know? I'm about ready to mash you to a pulp.
tell me, Costa, does your mum choose your shorts for you?
how dare you insult my mother?!
too short!
Thanks, mate.
you popped up just in time.
let me give you a hug.
no, Zoe, stay where you are.
it's too dangerous. You can't help me.
and I can't hold on for much longer.
I don't want you to fall.
you okay?
Oh boy!
since when do the police save the lives of thieves?
since thieves started saving children's lives. Am I wrong?
Hello, my little friends.
I've come to pay you a visit.
in memory of your father, who I knew so well.
off we go, and no letting uncle Costa down this time, okay?
enough!
this little game's lasted long enough! I'm not that easy to catch!
colossus, here we come!
Hmmm Hmmm of France...
Ouch!
let go of me, you filthy beast!
get off me! Bon voyage!
go on! Hopla!
it's over, Costa, you're under arrest.
this has gone on long enough!
catch this!
sorry, old boy, no choice!
I'm going to finish the job I started with your husband.
mum!
give him my regards when you're up there!
I'm your worst nightmare.
you'll pay for that, you nasty viper!
look out!
he's too heavy, I can't hold on to him!
don't move, I'm there.
what on earth is he up to now?
I think this time he's gone completely doolally!
look! Here he comes.
here he comes.
stop your clowning, Costa. Can't you see the game is over?
see you around, losers!
Costa! No!
No!
step back, there's nothing to see. Let the police do their work.
move away! You can go back home.
mum, I was in the zoo tonight and then I got in a boat and this big man wanted to catch me but he couldn't get me.
but before... well, Claudine, she was with the baddies.
that was really scary.
but luckily Dino was with me at the zoo and he gave a big whack to the baddy in the water and then he nearly drowned!
they took me to a big house and Nico came to find me and then it went all dark.
Hey, you two! You're not listening to me!
isn't my story interesting?
Ah, my little Zoe! This time it really is all over.
we'll always be together.
Zomcon presents...
a Bright New World.
from the darkest depths of outer space came an evil no man could predict.
a cloud of radiation engulfed our great planet.
scientists discovered that these space particles caused the reanimation of dead bodies...
zombies!
creatures with but one destructive need...
to devour the flesh of the living.
and so, we were forced to defend our homeland.
the Zombie Wars...
mankind pitted against legions of the undead.
but in our darkest hour, a savior...
Zomcon, and our founder,
Dr. Reinhold Geiger.
Dr. Geiger discovered that if the brain was destroyed, the zombie was destroyed, never to reanimate.
and so, the Zombie Wars were won.
Zomcon built security systems like the perimeter fence that encloses our towns in a wall of protective steel, and surrounds other towns right across this great land.
but even within the fence, danger lurked.
lingering radiation meant that anyone who died became a zombie.
be careful, Mrs. Smith.
he's not the man you married.
and then, a breakthrough...
the domestication collar.
with the collar in place, a red light comes on, telling us that the zombie's desire for human flesh has been contained, making the zombie as gentle as a household pet.
but if the collar light goes out, call Zomcon, or push the nearest safety button and we'll be there to handle any zombie problem, large or small.
thanks to Zomcon, we can all become productive members of society, even after we die.
or, for those who can afford it, a Zomcon funeral, complete with head coffin, guarantees you a burial you won't come back from.
your tax dollars allow Zomcon new ways to protect our homeland from the zombie threat, giving us more time to relax and be with our families.
so thank you, Zomcon, for winning the Zombie Wars and building a company for tomorrow that gives us a safer future today.
Zomcon, a better life through containment.
well, I think that informative film isn't that right, children?
Yes, Miss Mills.
our special guest is here.
everyone straighten your desks.
children, I would like to introduce
Willard's new head of security at Zomcon, who is not only a decorated hero of the Zombie Wars, but is also Zomcon's official safety expert.
Mr. Bottoms is the father of our newest, and I suspect our brightest student, Cindy.
well, good afternoon, boys and girls.
so how many of you have ever had to kill a zombie?
Ooh. Not too many, and that's the way I'd like to keep it.
my job at Zomcon is to make things safe for young people just like you.
that's why I'm building a taller fence, and there are going to be new safety vans patrolling our streets.
and we're going to take everybody's picture just in case one of you... gets lost.
what do you think of that?
children, does anyone have a question for Mr. Bottoms?
Yes, Roy.
Stan and me... I mean, me and Stan, have been Zomcon Cadets for two years, sir.
we think Zomcon's great.
that's terrific. Thank you.
does anyone have an actual question?
Timmy Robinson has a question.
Timmy, go on.
ask a good question.
are zombies dead or alive?
what a stupid question. - Really stupid.
no, no, no. There's no such thing as a stupid question.
the truth is, to some people, zombies might seem human.
but make no mistake, these creatures have only one goal, and that is to eat your flesh.
so without Zomcon, we'd all be dead.
and then where would we be?
dead? - Dead?
that's right.
so does that answer your question, Timmy?
I guess.
you guess?
well, this isn't a world where we guess, young man.
you either know something or you don't.
I was just thinking about the zombies who were buried too deep to get out of their coffins.
well, that's impossible. We always bury the heads separately.
I mean people buried before the space dust.
couldn't some of them still be in the graveyard right now,
well, children, look at that.
it's time for outdoor education.
let's show Mr. Bottoms how good we are, hmm?
in the brain and not the chest Head shots are the very best In the brain and not the chest Head shots are the very best In the brain and not the chest Head shots are the very best
trying to make Zomcon look stupid?
that wouldn't be hard.
what did you say?
nothing.
okay, mister. - But it's out of bullets!
it felt empty.
a good cadet always knows how many bullets he has left, son.
you idiot. - That's it.
detention, the pair of you.
that's not fair.
but he said Zomcon was stupid.
did you say that?
no, no.
pick up the box.
don't drop...
that's Mr. Bottoms' lamp.
if that could go to the den.
it's just to your right...
it's very fragile.
Hey, Timmy!
Hi, Mr. Theopolis.
that's no way to treat a bicycle.
sorry, Mrs. Henderson.
what have I told you about leaving you bike on the lawn?
now put it away properly.
was that so hard?
Yes, Mrs. Henderson.
what did you say?
I mean, no, Mrs. Henderson.
what are you looking at, Theopolis?
I'm going to take this apple pie over to our new neighbors.
see if they actually own all those zombies.
they probably do.
he's the new head of security at Zomcon.
the new head of security moved into the Johnsons' old place.
well, that's good news.
what on earth, Timmy?
that is a new shirt.
it was those bullies I told you about.
they pushed me down, and Stan pointed his gun at me.
what?
did people see you like this?
I don't know.
come here.
there you go. Everything's going to be fine.
just go and clean up, put on a new shirt, and we won't even have to talk about those bullies.
Oh, there's one other thing.
Hi, honey.
made just the way you like it.
a three olive martini.
what did I do to deserve this?
Helen, what are you up to?
I've had a long day.
Oh, Bill, honestly. Sometimes I wonder about you.
I really do.
if you must know,
I have a surprise for you.
Wow.
Hi, Dad.
Hiya, Tim.
how's my boy? - Fine.
are you ready? - There's more?
now, just relax.
isn't it wonderful?
now we're not the only ones on the street without one.
Helen, could I speak to you in the kitchen?
of course, dear. You're always so sensible.
Timmy, why don't you go watch some television?
Yeah, but, Mom, I don't...
I'm sure there's something wonderful on.
but, Bill, the neighbors.
everybody has one except for us.
well, Helen, in India everyone has a tiger.
why don't we just move there and get a tiger?
not everybody in India has a tiger, Bill.
that's what I heard.
we can't afford a zombie.
I'm barely keeping up with funeral payments as it is.
funerals. Is that all you ever think about, Bill?
I still can't believe you bought a funeral savings plan for Timmy.
come on, Helen.
the other kids hate him.
you said so yourself.
I met our new neighbors today.
did you know that he is the new head of security for Zomcon?
Really?
that's who moved into the old Johnson place?
Uh-huh. And did you know that they have six zombies. Six!
and when his wife asked me how many we had,
I didn't know what to say.
so I told her we had one.
you what?
what was I supposed to do?
tell her that my husband is afraid of zombies?
I'm not going to talk about this.
Hey.
zombie?
the roast.
dad. - Sorry.
I thought that was a different button.
what are you doing? It's hurting him.
sorry. I...
you know, I bet with our new neighbor, we'll have the safest street in Willard.
I can't argue with that.
and, obviously, it will be chained up in the backyard when it's not doing chores.
obviously.
it'll have to be.
Helen, propriety.
you're the boss, dear.
afraid of zombies.
I'll tell you what I'm afraid of, little lady.
nothing, that's what.
just stay right there.
think I'm afraid of you?
huh?
that what you think?
that's right.
that's right.
nicely done, Tammy.
no.
grandpa's fallen and he's getting up.
the elderly.
they seem friendly enough, but can you really trust them?
no.
so don't get caught off guard.
buy the Zomcon Zombie Alert heart monitor.
when the heart stops, we start.
aren't you going to help me practice, Dad?
Oh, is that today?
you already changed it from yesterday.
but I've already got the driving range booked.
don't other dads take their kids to the driving range?
no.
no, they don't.
honey, honey.
please don't play baseball by yourself.
it makes you look lonely.
now, I'm going over to meet our new neighbors.
but you said you already met the neighbors.
Timmy, I thought you were on my side.
give it here.
come on, stupid. Throw it.
it's a baseball.
you throw it.
you throw like a girl.
did it again.
it's so dumb.
Ow!
what are you doing?
it wasn't me.
you shot me with a B. B. Gun.
get him!
so, where do you want to get shot?
head shot, Roy.
that's the first smart thing you've said all day.
Roy! - Leave me alone!
ow, my arm.
my arm.
stay away from me.
stop, zombie! Stop!
let's get out of here.
and that loser Stan,
I thought he was going to pee himself.
crying like a sucky baby.
they sure won't pick on me again...
at least not when you're around.
what?
do you want to play?
okay.
we should get a name for you before Mom does.
I know.
how about Fido?
nice catch, Fido.
well, if you're not going to catch it, you got to go fetch it.
go get it, boy.
come on, boy.
you're disgusting.
why don't you go home and get some clothes on?
if your mother could see you now.
can't bear to look at you.
you rotten zombie!
you nearly scared me half to death.
stop that!
you're spoiling my quiet time!
Hello?
Oh, jeez.
stupid collar.
that's Mrs. Henderson.
what am I supposed to tell Mom and Dad?
you're not supposed to even be off your leash.
dad's going to kill me.
come on. I got to get you cleaned up.
Hi, Cindy.
my mom and your mom think we should be friends.
Oh.
sorry.
that's okay. I don't mind.
well, bye.
you're not allowed to have a zombie without a leash.
you're a kid.
I don't care about stupid Zomcon rules.
here comes my dad, and he sure cares.
Hello, Tommy. - It's Timmy.
right you are, sweetheart.
is that blood on your zombie?
uh, it was a nosebleed.
well, that's not a fresh zombie.
only fresh zombies bleed, son.
I meant my nose.
how did blood from your nose get on to your zombie, then?
I wiped it there.
daddy, can we go now?
I can't be late for my first ballet class.
all right, princess. Get in. Come on.
okay. Bye, Timmy.
I hate ballet.
I think we're in trouble, boy.
hmm. Heart attack, eh?
my grandpa had a heart attack.
you're not so bad, are you, boy?
too bad you had to go and eat Mrs. Henderson.
I don't even want to ask. - He got dirty.
and how on earth did he get dirty?
we were just in the park...
what were you doing in the park with the zombie?
you stupid zombie.
look at what you've done.
I'll never get it cleaned up in time, and in your father's garage!
you're not allowed in here. You know that, Timmy.
mom, when we were in the park...
Timmy, are you listening to me?
your father is going to send the zombie back.
no, Dad always does what you say.
no, not this time.
not with a zombie.
and then what are people going to say?
they're going to say that the Robinsons are strange, and they're going to be right.
it's nothing, Mom.
we'll clean this mess up.
dad won't even know.
I promise.
what was so important that you needed to tell me, Timmy?
um, it's Fido.
he protected me from the bullies.
Fido? Who's Fido?
what kind of a stupid name is Fido?
who names their zombie, anyway?
lots of people name their zombies.
Mr. Theopolis has a name for his.
I bet he does.
at any rate, zombies don't have heart attacks.
no, I mean before, when he was alive.
that's what killed him, like Grandpa.
what...
you know you're not supposed to talk about your grandfather.
sorry.
I forgot.
well, that's quite a thing to forget.
and she's missing since this morning?
well, she's always wandering off on her own.
I'm sure she'll turn up.
Mr. Henderson should have put her in a retirement home years ago.
really, Bill!
what would Francis do without her? He'd be all alone.
those homes are very comfortable and... secure.
they're only secure because they use the old prison.
well... she is over 65, Helen, and old people can't be trusted.
isn't that right?
Yeah, we had a lot of trouble with old people during the war.
jonathan, please.
he never gets tired of talking about that dreadful war.
you must have been, what, 10?
uh... 11.
any kills?
just... one.
someone close to home?
it was his father.
but you're fine now, aren't you, honey?
Yep.
well, you did what you had to, Robinson.
it's a terrible thing, the Zombie War.
families having to kill their own.
never lose sight of that.
I'd take Dee Dee's head off in a second if I had to.
he always says that.
don't let 'em get too close.
it makes it harder to pull the trigger.
well, that went well.
what is it, Timmy?
I just hope a zombie didn't get Mrs. Henderson.
what a thing to say.
well, what if somebody's zombie did attack her?
what then?
well, we all remember what happened to the Johnsons when their zombie ate those Christmas carolers.
did Zomcon really chuck them into the Wild Zone?
that's probably how the Bottoms got their house.
let's just say there's a very good reason we don't have prisons anymore.
well, Helen, he's gotta learn someday.
can't keep denying it.
Timmy, I think it's nice that you're caring so much about Mrs. Henderson.
but I think she's gonna be just fine.
come here. Come on! Come on!
come on. No more mistakes on Daddy's rug.
no, no, no. We're not going anywhere until you do your business.
spike, come here.
you're being a naughty boy tonight, huh?
why are you being such a naughty boy tonight, huh?
Oh, no.
stay away, Mrs. Henderson.
sorry, Mrs. Henderson.
you weren't very nice, Mrs. Henderson.
but I'm really sorry you're dead.
now you're in a garden.
you always liked plants.
so I hope that's okay.
Shh. You'll wake up Mom and Dad.
Oh, no. Your collar.
Hey, Timmy?
zombie troubles?
okay. Now, Tammy.
all right.
okay.
it's okay, boy.
Hey!
you trying to get yourself killed?
no.
let me tell you something.
I've had some pretty close calls with my Tammy.
lookee here.
you want that?
not the teeth, Tammy. Not the teeth, Tammy.
good girl.
she looks good for a zombie.
same as the day I met her.
she was shopping in the grocery store for candy corn with her mom.
had some kind of a brain aneurysm.
they slapped a collar on her before she even hit the floor.
got her before there was any decomposition.
where did you get all this stuff?
part of my severance package when I quit Zomcon.
Hey! Will you look at that?
watch this.
here you go, Sparky.
you used to be a smoker, boy?
old habits die hard.
you wanna rip my face off, don't you.
Oh, yes.
you wanna eat me for dinner.
how come zombies wanna eat people?
you know...
I don't know.
Geiger used to say it was their way of trying to come back to life.
would that work?
not a chance.
he was a strange bird, Geiger.
I think that when his wife went zombie, he couldn't stand the thought of losing her.
that's why he invented the collar in the first place.
okay.
go ahead, Tammy.
now...
not a word of this to anyone.
not your mom, not your dad.
this will be our little secret...
or it's free lawn mowing for a year.
Yes, sir.
much better. There you go.
is that Dad's suit?
Yes.
and we don't need to mention it to your father.
he won't even notice.
you look great, boy.
not bad at all.
hurry, your father's waiting.
do we have to go?
these Sunday drives are very important to your father.
how would it look if we didn't go together as a family?
but it's weird.
we never know anybody.
well, maybe this time we will.
Oh, I love this park. It's so peaceful.
come here, puppy. Come on.
come have some cheese.
have some cheese.
they seem, in the view of the foolish, to be dead.
and their passing away was part of affliction, and their going forth from us utter destruction.
but they are in peace.
for if before men indeed they be punished...
is that zombie wearing my suit?
what would you suggest, Bill? That I buy him a new one?
why didn't you leave him the way he was?
they way he was dressed? Come on, Bill.
head coffin, please.
head coffin.
this guy's not coming back, you can bet on that.
Shh.
look. This is the best part.
Emmitt Mitchell, from dust have you come and to dust shall you return...
...and from dust shall you not be resurrected.
so if a person dies and becomes a zombie, then they're not really dead.
no, not really.
well...
it's like being in purgatory before going to heaven.
what is your father doing?
so... zombies are sinners?
l... I suppose we're all sinners, honey.
but God sees the good in everyone.
God loves zombies, too? Even when they kill?
well, l... I think zombies kill because it's their nature.
so then it's not their fault.
no, not really.
what are you so happy about?
I was just gonna tell you something.
you know what Herman the gravedigger just told me?
bill, Timmy was... - Only 10% of people get funerals.
most become zombies. Can you believe that?
well, they are expensive.
I'd rather be a zombie than dead.
whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on there!
Timmy is making observations about the world.
I think it's healthy.
observation about the world?
he's a kid. What does he know?
he knows a lot.
at least he's not obsessed with funerals.
better than focusing on walking corpses...
who should be buried...
without their heads.
Hey!
we're all getting funerals.
all three of us!
bill, get your own funeral.
Timmy and I are going zombie.
would you look at that?
Zomcon at the Hendersons'.
I wonder why they're taking Francis away.
he probably gave her an illegal funeral...
without a permit.
is that bad?
Oh, yes.
Oh, dear!
this is how it always starts.
Oh, Bill.
one wild zombie, Helen. That's all it takes.
Hey, that's the schoolteacher.
any sign of the old lady?
God, I hate old people!
I'll be right back.
it's just water, boy. Come on!
you missed a spot.
Hi, boys.
Hi, Mom.
I thought you two might be thirsty.
Timmy! Timmy! Don't be cruel.
what's going on?
I was just bringing the boys something to drink.
zombies don't drink, Helen.
Yes, they can, Bill. They just don't have to.
we can pretend, can't we?
it doesn't hurt anybody, does it?
Hey!
give me that.
this is detail work.
it needs to be done delicately if you're gonna protect the finish.
that's why they call it "a man's job.
flesh-eating maniacs need not apply.
Hey, Helen.
Hey, get a move on, Robinson.
um...
why don't you... stay with us today, and we can be a family?
besides, you don't even like Floyd.
you told me yourself.
I said Floyd cheats at golf.
I didn't say I didn't like him.
I have a secret to tell you.
you... You're all wet, Helen.
I only had one rule.
which rule was that?
very funny, mister.
get this zombie chained up.
now!
Bye, honey!
now what is that?
this is her walker... thingy, sir.
at least that's what our witnesses say.
we caught these two in the bushes firing their. 22s at the wild zombies.
the little one?
shot Dougie in the leg.
get that out of sight, will ya?
it's a boot. Put it back.
so let me get this straight.
you're saying that the Robinson zombie tried to eat you and then moved on to Mrs. Henderson.
is that right?
Yes, sir.
well, I don't see any bite marks.
well, he actually didn't try to bite us.
shut up, Stan!
he broke my arm.
do you know what I think?
I think that you shot the old lady just like, uh...
just like you shot Dougie over there.
no way! It's all Timmy Robinson's fault.
you got nothing to worry about now, boy.
dad loves ya!
come on!
they'll never split us up, Fido! Ever!
Whoo!
come on, boy!
that was fun, boy.
did you like swimming?
you know, I didn't even know you could swim.
we gotta get you back before Dad comes home.
don't do anything, boy.
boy"?
let's just shoot him now, Roy.
Nah. Let's stick to the plan.
what are you doing?
we're gonna be heroes.
what... What are you talking about?
we know your zombie killed the old lady.
we told Bottoms, and he's gonna send your whole family to the Wild Zone.
what? - Shut up, Stan!
he would have believed us, too, if you'd let me do the talking.
you're the one who blew it. - Shut up! You're wrecking the fun.
I'm just saying... - Shut up!
Roy, stop telling me... - Shut up!
okay, Robinson...
I'm gonna shoot him dead just before he gets to you.
I'm gonna save your life from the zombie.
he's gonna pay for everything.
do it, Roy!
jeez, Roy! Blast him!
Oh, crap! You made me shoot my stupid brother!
Oh, jeez!
please don't eat me, Fido.
I knew you wouldn't eat me, boy.
I knew it.
hurry and untie me.
you're right, boy. It's not gonna work.
you gotta go for help.
you better clean up first.
quick, Fido.
please!
good boy! That'll hold him.
now go get Mom.
Fido, wait!
you promise not to eat Mom, right?
I got it!
I got it! Stand aside.
it's Joe Peterson. - Not anymore he ain't.
little rusty.
okay.
bull's-eye.
Hey.
nice shot.
goodness, Fido, you scared me.
what is it? Where's Timmy?
what...
what...
is something wrong? Is Timmy in trouble?
please, someone help!
which way, Fido? Is this the right way?
hold on.
your collar!
why aren't you eating me?
for goodness sake, Fido.
help!
which way now, Fido?
help! Help!
get away!
mom!
Oh, Timmy!
thank God you're all right.
God! Timmy!
you crazy wonderful zombie.
you never saw this.
they were zombies, and they were going to kill you.
I know, Mom.
I did what I had to do.
I know.
and I don't want you thinking that what we did is normal or okay in any way.
I don't.
nice shot. - Thanks.
it's so nice to see Cindy with a friend.
she doesn't have many?
we're always moving. It's...
it's hard for any of us to make friends.
jonathan seems to like it that way.
bill's lived in Willard his entire life, and he still doesn't have any friends.
and he definitely likes it that way.
he must be excited about the new baby.
he hasn't even noticed.
how could he not notice?
you want another beer?
I wouldn't say no.
Dee Dee, get us a couple of cold ones, will ya?
coming right up, dear.
Hey. You're not actually gonna get him another beer, are you?
get your own beer, Bill.
come on. Let me show you the war room.
so that Helen of yours...
what a live wire.
get your own beer, Bill.
makes you wonder what's going on in that little head of hers.
you can say that again.
my first kill.
that is Uncle Bob.
now, I gather it was Helen's idea to get a zombie.
Yes, it was.
she seems pretty friendly with it.
what are you suggesting?
look, Robinson, when people get attached to their zombies, it, uh... it only spells trouble.
trouble for me, trouble for you...
trouble for Mrs. Henderson.
Mrs... Mrs. Henderson?
somebody's zombie got her.
did they?
well, I don't know, Robinson. Why don't you tell me.
chances are you know a lot more than you think.
well, that was fun.
Timmy, go to bed.
Helen, we have to talk.
Oh, lighten up, Bill.
I am trying to have a serious discussion with you, Helen.
turn that off, Helen!
what is that damn zombie doing in my E-Z Boy?
we haven't danced since our wedding night.
this is hardly the time.
come on, Bill. Dance with me.
I don't...
that... is enough.
well, if you're not gonna dance with me,
I know someone who will.
nighty-night.
I'm sorry about Bill. He's...
he's just...
I wish I would have known you before.
before you died.
do you remember that?
can I see that?
what are you doing with Fido?
Oh, I think we both know what's gonna happen to Fido.
No! You can't!
he didn't do anything wrong!
well, maybe he didn't, but you did.
and because you made friends with a zombie, a lot of nice people in this neighborhood got killed.
you didn't think of that, did you?
do you know that I could send you and your whole family to the Wild Zone for what you've done?
how do you think I got the Johnson place?
but I had a nice talk with your parents, and they assured me that nothing like this would ever happen again.
isn't that right, Helen?
go to your room.
now.
Yes, sir.
these little problems are all about containment.
and Floyd hits this big slice into the clubhouse, and the ball hits old man Patterson right between the eyes.
I thought we were gonna have our first zombie golfer.
how come they blame the bullies for Mrs. Henderson getting killed?
well, we're just lucky to have a neighbor like Mr. Bottoms.
your mother is right, Tim.
but Fido had to die.
the bullies got blamed for it anyways.
mom killed the bullies and didn't tell anyone.
how come she didn't get in trouble?
why... Why are we talking about this?
I thought we agreed we weren't gonna have to talk about this!
bill, where are you going?
I loved Fido, too, you know.
you did? - Yeah.
in a way I did.
like Mr. Theopolis loves Tammy?
no, he does not.
like a friend, Timmy.
just like that.
you see, Timmy, the thing about your dad...
is that he is still a part of this family.
he is?
of course he is.
why would you say something like that?
I think he loves us.
I do.
I just think that he's afraid to admit it.
dad, you just passed the school.
Oh.
so I did.
Bye, Dad.
uh, Timmy...
uh...
look, l... I know it's hard.
I understand.
you do?
sure I do.
look, son...
I know when you're a kid, you feel things.
a lot of...
things.
but you have to get over that.
get over what?
feelings.
feelings.
not important, okay?
being alive is what counts.
wait a minute. I got something.
go on. Open it.
it's a gun. - Take it out.
I know you're not supposed to have a handgun...
until you're 12...
but it can come in real handy.
what do you say?
Thanks, Dad.
this will just be between us.
keep it in your book bag.
don't forget the bullets.
there you go.
have a good day, Tim.
Bye, Dad.
do you think we did the right thing sending Fido back?
I had a great chat with Tim today.
I think everything is gonna be just fine.
Really?
Absolutely.
bill, do you love me?
I'm pregnant.
Oh.
I'm sure it's nothing. You're just gaining a little weight.
I just don't think on my salary I can afford another funeral.
are you sure? - I heard Daddy on the phone.
he said he never wastes a good zombie.
he's got him working the factory.
can you get us in there?
are you crazy? My dad would kill me.
no, I mean he really would kill me.
but I know someone who can.
not the teeth, baby. Good girl.
Mr. Theopolis?
Yeah.
is Tammy your girlfriend?
what do you mean?
Cindy says that she's your girlfriend, and you got fired from Zomcon for having a zombie girlfriend.
she said that?
aren't you worried they'll take her away?
Nah.
I'll just get me another one, the same vintage.
Hey, I'm kidding.
I went and hurt her feelings.
so, you clear on the plan?
Yeah.
Theopolis. - Hi, Frank.
what are you doing back here?
Oh, you know, just bringing the old unit in for a tune-up.
it's, um... Tammy.
right? - That's right. Tammy.
so...
okay, go ahead.
Thanks, Frank.
if Timmy hadn't broken the rules in the first place, none of this would have happened.
he messed up, not me.
I suppose you think he got so attached to the damned thing because I'm a bad father.
I'd say I'm a pretty darn good father.
my father tried to eat me.
I don't remember trying to eat Timmy.
bill, just because your father tried to eat you, does that mean we all have to be unhappy...
forever?
welcome to Zomcon's returns department.
please... stay with your zombie at all times, maintain an orderly line between the railings, and use our conveniently placed safety buttons...
come on.
are you all right, Mr. Theopolis? - Yeah, I'm fine.
now, the door into the factory is right behind the clerk.
are you ready?
all right.
honey...
I'm gonna be gone for a little while, and then I'm gonna come back, all right?
you stay here.
all right. Let's do this.
wild zombie! Wild zombie!
that's my Tammy.
you... You knucklehead!
all right, seal off the returns room...
and shut off that damned alarm.
you naughty little boy.
no, not you. I'll call you back.
I'll be right down!
Hello, Timmy.
No!
turn the car around.
we need to keep the road clear.
of course, Frank.
what's happening here? - I'll call it in!
this way! This way!
bill, give me that gun. I'm going in.
you stay here in case Timmy shows up.
no, l... I want to.
bill, give me the shotgun.
I am a good father.
remember, Helen... head coffin.
I just wanna show you something. - You can't make me go!
come on! - No!
now... take a look, all right?
out there is chaos.
and in here is safety.
people who don't understand that end up on the wrong side of the fence.
now go on and make yourself some friends.
No! No!
let me out! Please!
stay away from me.
come on, Robinson.
all right. All right.
Fido, it's you.
Where's Timmy Boy?
they're not particularly fast, are they?
dad!
I'd like you to let my son back inside the gate now, please.
I don't think so.
now you be quiet!
help!
leave him alone!
dad!
get him, boy!
Fido! Behind you!
mom!
Where's your father?
get in.
see you later, Frank.
my God.
Zomcon forces spent Saturday afternoon securing a Wild Zone breach within Willard's own Zomcon Containment Center.
human casualties were low, but the nation mourns one of its greatest and most respected war heroes.
Zomcon Chief John Bottoms died valiantly while defending the people of Willard from a wild zombie outbreak caused by this man...
a once-trusted Zomcon security guard, who was caught accepting bribes from a renegade group of wild zombie poachers.
are you ready, dear?
head coffin, please.
from dust have you come, and to dust shall you return.
but from dust shall you not be resurrected.
it's what he always wanted.
okay, Tammy, just what you ordered.
now don't you move a muscle.
there's only one Tammy in the world, right?
nice catch!
Hi, Timmy. Hi, Fido.
Hi, Timmy.
surprised?
sort of.
it's okay. He's so cool in a way.
and he's a lot nicer.
do you wanna play catch? - Sure.
does, uh, your zombie wanna play?
what do you call him, anyways?
I don't know.
right now I'm just calling him Daddy.
sure. Okay.
come on.
come on, Daddy.
what? It was just a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.
you're such a little lapdog.
he's got "killer" printed all over his forehead. - OK!
Really? Well, why'd the cops let him go, smart guy?
obviously they don't watch enough movies. This is standard horror movie stuff.
prom Night revisited, man. - Yeah? Why would he want to kill his own girlfriend?
there's always some stupid, bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend.
Oh? - That's the beauty of it all: simplicity.
besides, if it gets too complicated, you lose your target audience.
well, what's his reason?
maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
[ laughs ] What, is she saving herself for you? - Maybe.
now that Billy tried to mutilate her, do you think Sid would go out with me?
no, I don't at all. No.
you know who I think it is?
you know, I think it's her father.
why can't they find her pops, man?
because he's probably dead.
his body will come popping up in the last reel somewhere!
eyes gouged out, fingers cut off, teeth knocked out!
the police are always off track with this shit. - Man!
if they'd watch "Prom Night," they'd save time.
there's a formula to it. A very simple formula! Everybody's a suspect!
I'm telling you, the dad's a red herring. It's Billy.
how do we know you're not the killer? Huh?
huh? - Hi, Billy.
maybe your movie-freaked mind lost its reality button. You ever think of that?
you're absolutely right. I'm the first to admit it.
if this were a scary movie, l'd be the prime suspect. - That's right.
and what would be your motive?
it's the millennium.
motives are incidental.
"Millennium." Hmm.
"Millennium." I like that. That's good. It's the millennium.
good kid.
"Millennium." Good word, my man.
are you telling me that's not a killer?
sure is quiet.
[ Sidney ] God, look at this place.
it's The Town That Dreaded Sundown.
Yeah, I saw that movie. It's about a killer in Texas, huh?
Mm. - Hey, Sid, just think.
if they make a movie about you, who's going to play you?
I shudder to think. - I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.
Thanks, Dewey. With my luck, they'd cast Tori Spelling.
I'm just going to be a few minutes.
you girls don't go too far.
is Billy going to be there tonight?
he'd better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut.
I think we can live without the endorphin rush for one night.
Billy's right, you know. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.
so you have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death.
that's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
Yeah, but he has been so patient with me with all the sex stuff.
how many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
Billy and his penis don't deserve you, all right?
Dewey, where the hell you been?
I was keeping an eye on Sidney, uh
thought you quit. - I did. But damn it
Dewey, Vital Phone just faxed us.
those calls are listed to Neil Prescott, Sidney's father.
he made the calls with a cellular phone. It's been confirmed.
there's no way a cellular could been cloned?
there's more. Guess what tomorrow is.
the anniversary of his wife's death.
we'll keep the roadblocks and the curfew in effect through the night.
if he's not picked up by morning, then we'll do a house-to-house.
Where's Sidney? - She's with my sister.
you want me to bring her in? - No.

sex equals death. Okay?
number two: You can never drink or do drugs.

we gotta get back.
you okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine. [ Chuckles ]
who'd you call?
what?
um, well, I don't know, when you're arrested you're allowed one phone call.
so I was just curious. Who'd you call?
called my dad.
no, um, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
Yeah, but when I called I didn't get an answer.
huh.
you don't still think it was me, do ya?
no.
no.
I was just thinking, if it were you it'd be a very clever way to throw me off track.
you know, using your one phone call to call me so I wouldn't think it was you.
really.
what do I have to do to prove to you that I'm not a killer?
Oh, my God. - Huh?
Oh, my God. - Sidney-- - Billy, watch out!
Ah! - Ah!

[ woman On Radio ] 7825, suspect at 105 North Avenue 52.
hello. Help me, please. I'm at Stu Marker's house on Turner Lane.
it's 261 Turner Lane. Please, he's going to try and kill me.
[ yells ] - [ Grunting ]
[ grunts ]
Sidney! Sidney!
Jesus, we've got to get the fuck out of here!
stop right there! - Don't shoot. It's me! I found Tatum. She's dead.
I think Stu did it. - Don't listen to him, Sidney!
stay back! - Stu did it.
he killed Billy. He killed my Tatum. - You did it!
he killed my Tatum! - No, I didn't! - You lie!
he killed my Tatum! - No, I didn't! - You lie!
Sidney, baby, please, give me that gun!
give me that gun! Christ, man!
no, I didn't. Sid, he did it!
he did it, Sidney! Please, I didn't do it. He did it. Please!
please, Sidney. Oh! - Fuck you both!
please! - No! No! Sidney!
[ banging On Door ] - Open up! He did it!
[ grunts ] Help me! He's going crazy!
[ banging Continues ] - Sidney! Go away!
Sidney?
[ whispers ] Leave me alone. [ Sobs ]
[ grunts ]
Sid. - Billy.
[ grunts ]
[ gasps ]
Oh! Billy. Billy. Are you okay?
I'm okay. - I thought you were dead.
no, I'm like a stuck pig, but I'm all right.
get up.
I'm okay. - You're bleeding.
Oh, my God. - We've gotta get help.
no, he's out there! - No, give me the gun. Give me the gun. It's okay.
it's okay. It's okay.
careful.
please help me! - Come in, come in!
Stu's flipped out! He's gone mad!
we all go a little mad sometimes.
no, Billy! - Oh, fuck!
[ screams ]
[ moans ] - [ Sobs ]
Anthony Perkins, "Psycho.
[ panting ]
Mm.
corn syrup. Same stuff they used for pig's blood in "Carrie.
[ gasps, Panting ] Stu.
help me, please.
[ killer's Voice ] Surprise, Sidney.
No! - Ooh!
Oh, now. Whoa.
what's the matter, Sidney? You look like you've seen a ghost.
[ gasps ] Why are you doing this?
it's all part of the game, Sidney.
it's called "Guess How I'm Gonna Die." - Fuck you!
no, no, no, no, no. We already played that game, remember?
you lost. - It's a fun game, Sidney.
see, we ask you a question, and if you get it wrong, "boo-kah," you die!
you get it right, you die.
you're crazy, both of you. - Actually, we prefer the term "psychotic.
you'll never get away with this. - Oh, no?
tell that to Cotton Weary.
you wouldn't believe how easy he was to frame.
watch a few movies, take a few notes.
it was fun. [ Chuckles ] - No!
Whoa! - Where're you going?
[ sobbing ] Why?
[ slams Counter ] - Why did you kill my mother?
Why? [ Shouts ] Why?
did you hear that, Stu? I think she wants a motive.
[ chortling ]
I don't really believe in motive, Sid.
I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive? -No.
did they ever really decide why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people? Don't think so!
see, it's a lot scarier when there's no motive, Sid.
we did your mom a favor, Sid.
that woman was a slut-bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone.
Yeah, we put her out of her misery, 'cause let's face it, Sidney, your mother was no Sharon Stone, hmm?
is that motive enough for you?
how about this?
your slut mother was fucking my father, and she's the reason my mom moved out and abandoned me.
how's that for a motive?
maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior.
lt certainly fucked you up. lt made you have sex with a psychopath.
that's right. You gave it up. Now you're no longer a virgin. Oh!
I said "virgin." Whoops!
now you gotta die. Those are the rules.
let's pretend it's all a scary movie, Sid. How do you think it's gonna end?
[ panting ]
Oh! Oh! This is the greatest part! You're gonna love this.
we got a surprise for you, Sidney.
Yeah, you're gonna love this one. It's a scream, baby!
hold on a sec. I'll be right back. [ Moans ]
you know what time it is, Sid?
it's after midnight.
it's your mom's anniversary. Congratulations.
we killed her exactly one year ago today.
attention! Oh, what do we have behind door number three, Sidney?
daddy! - Whoa, hold it.
that's enough.
guess we won't be needing this anymore. -Uh-huh!
and, oh, look at this. Ring, ring. Won't need this.
got the ending figured out yet, Sid?
come on, Sidney. You think about it now, huh?
your daddy's the chief suspect. We cloned his cellular.
the evidence is all right there, baby! - What if your father snapped?
your mother's anniversary set him off, and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone.
except for Billy and me. We were left for dead.
then he kills you and shoots himself in the head.
perfect ending. - I thought of that.
watch this.
ready? - Yeah. Yeah! I'm ready, baby!
right! Get up! Yeah, babe, get up! Hit it!
[ groans ] - [ Gasps ]
good one, man. Jesus.
Oh, shit.
my turn.
don't forget. Stay to the side and don't go too deep.
okay. I'll remember.
Ah! Fuck! Fuck!
fuck! Goddamn it, Stu!
sorry, Billy. I guess I got a little too zealous, huh?
give me the knife. - No.
give me the knife!
now!
you see, Sid, everybody dies but us. Everybody dies but us.
we get to carry on and plan the sequel, 'cause let's face it, baby, these days ya gotta have a sequel!
[ stabbing Sounds ] - [ Yelling ]
you sick fucks. You've seen one too many movies.
now, Sid, don't you blame the movies.
movies don't create psychos. Movies make psychos more creative!
[ grunts ] Stop it, Billy, would you? All right?
I can't take any more. I feel a little woozy here!
all right. All right, you get the gun.
I'll untie Pops, okay?
[ dripping ]
now! - Okay.
[ panting ]
um. Uh
Houston, we-- we have a problem here.
what? - The gun, man. The gun.
I put it right there, and it's not there.
where the fuck is it? - Right here, asshole.
man, I thought she was dead. - She looked dead, man.
still does. - I've got an ending for you.
the reporter left for dead in the news van comes to, stumbles on you two dipshits, finds the gun, foils your plan and saves the day.
I like that ending.
I know something you don't.
fuck. No!
Yeah, man.
Yeah. Aw, so sweet.
it works better without the safety on. - [ Neck Muscles Crack ]
[ panting ]
this is Gale Weathers signing off.

[ phone Ringing ] - Fuck!
shall I let the machine get it?
Hello? - [ Distorted Voice ] Are you alone in the house?

not so fast. We're gonna play a little game.
it's called "Guess Who Just Called The Police And Reported Your Sorry Motherfucking Ass.

I think I'm dying here, man.
[ weeping ] - Talk to her. Talk to her.
hello. - Oh, Stu, Stu, Stu. What's your motive?
Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you gonna tell them?
peer pressure. I'm far too sensitive.
I'm gonna rip you up, you bitch, just like your fucking mother!
you've gotta find me first, you pansy-assed mama's boy! - Fuck!
Ow. You fucking hit me with the phone, dick!
[ glass Shattering ] - Fucker, where are you?

okay, I think it's going to go something like this. Just stay with me.
[ siren Wailing ] - Hi, this is Gale Weathers with an exclusive eyewitness account of this amazing breaking story.
several more local teens are dead...
bringing to an end the harrowing mystery of the mass killing...
that has terrified this peaceful community...
like the plot of some scary movie.
lt all began with a scream over 9-1-1...
and ended in a bloodbath that has rocked the town of Woozesburg, all played out here in this peaceful farmhouse...
far from the crimes and the sirens of the larger cities...
that its residents had fled.
okay, let's take it back to one. Come on. Move it.
this is my big shot. Let's go.
[ thunderclap ]
[ thunder Rumbling ]
what?
a vital clue?
clinton didn't smoke cigarettes.
there's no seaplane.
the police will arrive late tonight or early in the morning by craft.
lt takes six to eight hours. We will harbor here until.
good. Thank you very much, Captain.
l guess that means an inquest and reporters.
you better get your left profile ready. -Shut up, Christine.
they can't very well bury him at sea, can they?
no, there's too much pollution in the Mediterranean already.
poor Clinton. lt's such a shame.
lt would have been such a big grosser for him: The Last of Sheila.
Hey, now, he's dead.
how can you sit around here and talk about some goddamn movie...
and he's dead... Will you stop hawking that ice bucket?
l'm just gonna have my Bloody Mary straight up.
me, too. Bourbon.
Christine, listen, Clinton's misadventure is unfortunate...
but an accident is an accident, and a film is a film.
has it occurred to anybody that this isn't the first accident?
yesterday, the propeller. Last night, the stone.
what do you mean?
suppose the propeller wasn't an accident. Suppose it was a mistake.
you mean someone was trying to kill Clinton?
why should anyone want to kill Chris? -Yeah, we're not in Hollywood.
come off it, Tom.
look, l assumed Clinton was swimming near the propeller. l heard him yelling.
didn't you? Didn't we all? -What fantasies are you building?
who did not solve the game last night?
why did you say " that's funny " when we were standing outside the chapel?
because it was locked when l left last night.
then why was it unlocked this morning, and why did Clinton put the sign out?
because the game was over.
lt was, but it shouldn't have been.
l had the homosexual card, and the game should have gone on until l found him.
exactly. There were some interesting points in the chapel.
Lnteresting how? Obviously, he was leaving.
the storm shook the place and the stone fell on him.
not unless he was crawling.
why would he be crawling?
the stone that fell on Clinton's head came from the base of the column.
lt was grooved.
the tops of the columns are shaped like acanthus leaves, the bottoms are grooved.
Lnteresting point number one.
then, there was that piece of wood.
what's that?
l found it in the folds of Clinton's robe.
lt's from the grille on the door to the priest's box.
Lnteresting point number two.
l didn't see any grille on the priest's door.
right. You never found him, you said. -What do you mean, he said?
there was a grille last night, but not this morning.
that grille was removed. Why? Where's the rest of it?
and what was this doing in the priest's box?
clinton didn't smoke cigarettes.
Newport.
l'm not the only one who smokes Newports.
come on. There are cartons all over the ship.
l'm smoking one. -What's the difference?
did you smoke in there? -No.
you? -l never found him.
of course. l forgot.
honey? -l don't know. l don't remember.
but surely not in the priest's box. -Of course not.
Lnteresting point number three. A cigarette nobody smoked.
l don't think Clinton died near the pillar at all. l think he died in the priest's box.
and not from a stone falling or otherwise.
so what do you think happened?
l think he was about to leave when somebody came in.
l am not saying one of us.
somebody came in, smashed through the grille
with what, pray tell?
l don't know. Maybe something he brought with him.
he or she. -The candleholder, perhaps.
crossed my mind.
maybe it was an accident.
maybe. But at any rate, he decided to make it look like an accident.
l'm theorizing that he or she stood there for a moment...
assessing the situation, which would account for the cigarette.
slipped the sign under the door so there wouldn't be any more interruptions.
dragged Clinton over, placing him near the pillar...
smashed the stone down, thereby making his first mistake.
he assumed the stone was from the top of the column. lt wasn't.
but there was very little light.
now, he had the problem of the wood.
what problem?
darling, he couldn't very well leave the grille broken.
he hoped, with the frame empty, it would go unnoticed.
unfortunately, second mistake. One piece had lodged in Clinton's robe.
the only thing left then was to get rid of the splintered pieces: probably in the sea.
and the game was over.
hell, l think we can agree that none of us did it, can't we?
l mean, who would?
l really mean, who wouldn't? But who really would?
right. After all, we're not the only people around.
what about some of the weirdoes on this ship? What about Vittorio?
that's not what Tom has been saying. Tom has been saying...
that one of us did it. Or haven't you been listening?
hold it. -l don't care, that's your problem.
hold it, please. l'm sorry, l was only exploring. l haven't accused anyone.
yet.
look, let me just get this out.
five minutes, and then l'm gonna have five scotches and take a long nap.
you think you know who? -No.
then stop telling us what you don't know and tell us what you do.
there is someone who might clear this up for us.
who? -Clinton.
so help me God, if this is a hoax and he comes through that door...
l'm gonna throw this cut glass ashtray right in his face.
there's no hoax. Clinton's dead all right.
just say what's on your mind.
okay. -May l have another?
l think it's tied up to the game we've been playing this week.
do you have the cards he handed out the first night?
we passed it. l have no idea where mine is.
all right. l'll go and look for it.
Thanks.
l wonder what we're gonna feel like an hour from now.
when Tom's finished writing the scene, l'll tell you what attitude to play.
l've done it before, you know.
l'm beginning to wish l hadn't started all this.
you could stop right now.
lt's gonna be interesting.
thank you.
all right. Now, if everyone will please put their cards...
if you'll pardon the expression, on the table.
there's only five there. Where's the other one?
Tom? -l'll show mine in a minute.
l'd like to see it now.
give him a chance.
all right.
we all knew about two of these secrets. We've already played them.
'Shoplifter " and " homosexual. "
the others, we're seeing for the first time.
'Ex-convict. " " lnformer. " " Child... "
excuse me. " Little Child Molester. "
and mine.
so, this was Clinton's idea for a week of fun.
him assigning us secrets, us discovering them.
and it was a good game.
but some of us began to suspect there was more to it than met the eye.
that Clinton had not assigned these six secrets at random...
but that each player had been, at one time in his life...
guilty of one of them.
Oh, no.
not guilty of the secret he was assigned.
clinton was a far more elegant game player than that.
and he didn't want us refusing to play on the first night...
which we well might have done had we been assigned our own secrets.
so it was more than a game.
lt was a private joke.
what does your card say? -ln a minute.
a man is dead.
evidence indicates that it's murder.
and we've discovered...
the murdered man was playing a sadistic game with his guests.
a game whose central theme was six hidden shreds from the past.
any questions?
Yeah, but you see he knew that l never meant to
Christine, wait.
that's bullshit!
nobody would have knocked Clinton's brains in because of some stupid secret.
l agree.
look at these cards. Enough to make us squirm. Sure.
enough to remind us of just how nasty Clinton could be. Sure.
but enough to kill him?
no.
do let's see your card, old boy.
'Hit-and-run killer. "
what is this sick joke? -No.
clinton always took his games seriously. He wouldn't have spoiled this with a joke.
lt seems clear enough he believed one of us guilty of a hit-and-run killing.
Sheila.
the game was to be Clinton's revenge.
on? -The person whom he thought...
but couldn't prove, to be guilty of Sheila's death.
on the last night, Saturday, my turn, he was gonna pull the plug on that person.
how do you know?
he told me yesterday when he gave me the pill for my back.
okay, everybody.
what are you waiting for? Let's all get up and run around in a circle.
this is musical chairs, isn't it? lsn't that what this is, musical chairs?
ln Tom's mind, anyway.
why, it's just one of Tom's damn fantasies.
but you're all still here.
okay...
l'll start.
l had a thing with Clinton.
lt wasn't much more than me feeling sorry for him.
lt didn't last long.
and it's in the past now.
more than ever, right now.
Tom, am l just being slow?
are you claiming that homosexual card, meaning you're in the clear?
because l don't know about the rest of you.
and l'm in no position to challenge your little story, charming as it was.
but then it's equally true that Clinton could've come up with dirty half-truths...
about you, you, you, or any of us.
l mean, what gives you the exclusive right to that card?
fair enough. l just looked at the cards and saw only one that applied to me.
lf the same is true of you, Anthony, then that's another story.
and it may mean that Clinton's game is invalid.
well?
are you trying to say l'm a homosexual now?
nobody says you're anything.
l just looked at the cards and said l was the homosexual. That's all.
but that was in the past.
they're all in the past.
anybody want to say anything?
l mean, if ever there was an " unofficial investigation, " this is it, right?
or should l tell you that Lee and l once heard rumors...
about a shoplifting incident concerning somebody in this room?
okay.
Thanks.
shoplifter, that's me. lt's the only one.
l stole a coat. Et cetera, et cetera.
don't look so shocked, Anthony.
l'll swipe you some lD bracelets and you'll forget all about it.
all right.
me for the five scotches.
Tom, if l may? -Sure.
that leaves the other four of us somewhat dangling, wouldn't you say?
hello.
what can l say? l was a secretary, and l was just too eager.
so l dropped a few names to the House Un-American Activities Committee.
then those people didn't work for a while. Now they work.
sometimes l try and get them work.
sometimes l see them on the street, and sometimes they cross the street.
so what?
there is one thing that confuses me. -Shoot.
l'm just pursuing a thought, you understand? But as l see it...
the logical person to have killed Clinton is you...
because... -Because... No, go ahead.
l need some ice. -That's right.
because no one else felt so threatened. You were the only one
who knew about the hit-and-run killer card.
l was the only one meant to know about it.
clinton would never have given that card to the person he thought to be the killer.
l was horrified when l saw the card. l spoke to Clinton about it.
he laughed. Said he just made up a lot of melodramatic secrets.
but l'm guessing the killer overheard our conversation...
and understood Clinton's real motive.
you're cold, Tom.
you think it's me, don't you?
your wife was 100 miles away...
and your sophisticated director friend here seems cool enough...
but l'm a little nervous.
besides, you dislike me too much. -l have no reason to dislike you.
l feel it, though. -Anthony, l don't think this is the moment.
l think it's the moment. My moment. Time for my theory.
now, today, we saw all the cards for the first time.
lt didn't take us long to find the truth in three of them.
and your mind worked fast.
l could almost hear it ticking over as you quickly labeled Lee...
the ex-convict, arrested in some anti-war rally.
sentence suspended sort of thing. And Philip here?
he can kid his way along with some witty child molester jokes.
and that leaves me.
l've done time.
l've been in prison twice, for assault. And l can prove it.
can anyone else here make that particular claim?
disappointed, Tom?
actually, l was arrested some years ago.
no. -l was. l was arrested.
not just arrested. You see that card? " Arrested " is quite different.
as a matter of fact, l...
at this point, l don't think we can go any further.
what?
what l mean is, we've established what we set out to prove.
what is this?
l mean, we can't...
we all agreed to this...
we can't draw any ironclad conclusions. lt's all theoretical.
that's just fine. lt's theoretical. But it's hardly fair to stop now, is it?
ls it, Philip?
l mean, you want to choose from what's left?
we've got...
dented fenders, or...
how about a little petting in the playground?
stop, everybody, please.
by which l just mean let me get this over with.
l was drunk. l was too drunk to drive.
no, Tom, stay there, please.
l am so sorry l didn't tell you.
l know you would've helped me do the right thing, but l just couldn't.
l drove down the coast to the party. l overshot the driveway.
my car skidded. l didn't even see her.
l panicked. So l turned around and drove all the way back to Santa Barbara.
the next morning l wrote that silly note about having to visit my school friend.
and l took the car and l drove as far away as l could. Las Vegas.
l traded cars at the car rental place, and then, that afternoon, l drove home.
and l thought l was safe.
until the game.
lt was things that you said, Tom.
l started to think, and then...
l was the one who looked at the card.
l know the point of the game.
l think it's vicious and l'd like you to stop it.
go away.
why did you wait so long?
l only found out last week.
Harry's Rent-A-Car, Las Vegas. Remember?
lt was-- -l happened to meet Harry.
lt was an accident. lt was only an accident.
l swear, Clinton, l'm sorry. l didn't...
he said he hoped you weren't still worried about the damage to the car.
l couldn't get control. l was drinking!
the police never checked on out-of-state cars.
please don't tell them. Please, Clinton!
you want to let the whole world know?
that's what gave me the idea for the game.
because the harder you try to keep a secret in, the more it wants to get out.
see you Saturday. -No!
please!
son of a bitch!
Clinton? ls somebody there?
what's going on?
you're so smart.
you didn't think it could be me.
he kept whispering. He kept taunting me over and over again.
darling, he was so mean. -Lee, you don't have...
l would like to go downstairs and make a clean exit by myself.
okay?
don't worry, everybody, l'm okay.
sorry, Tom, but that " clean exit " line bothers me.
Lee, open up.
God damn it, Lee, unlock this door or l'll break it down!
l like you, but go away.
l want a nap.
then we'll talk about all kinds of stuff. l'm okay.
l swear to God, l'm okay.
all right, darling, if you say so.
l'll come back in a little while.
okay?
ls she all right?
the door is locked, but she talked to me.
she just wants to be alone.
lt just never occurred to me. -You thought it was Anthony.
l don't even know what l thought.
l'm sorry. -Don't be.
you got other things on your mind.
what do you think? Think there's anything we can do to help?
let me know what you come up with.
my God, what a sick business this is!
are you all right? -l am not.
l am in a deep state of shock.
Anthony just told me...
the deal that Alice's ex-agents made for her on the Douglas picture...
and l will never get over it. Would you like some cake?
Yes, please. -How's Tom?
he says he doesn't want anything to eat. -What about Lee?
not a sound. He's been down half a dozen times already.
she's probably passed out.
l never knew she was a boozer.
ln and out. -She was AA for a while.
still locked. She doesn't answer.
the captain must have a master key. -l got it.
shall l wake her? l don't know.
you want me to go with you? -No, thank you.
Lee, darling?
when l saw her in that chapel, murder was scrawled all over her face.
when l write my autobiography, that line is gonna need a little help.
l felt undercurrents all evening. -Now you felt undercurrents.
you know, l knew it. Something told me it was gonna be a bummer in there.
that door creaked open even before l touched it.
and then Clinton getting so physical, and that awful, faraway look in his eye.
who is it?
l'm sorry.
that's okay. Have you met my fiance?
have you seen Lee? -No, why, is anything wrong?
what?
lee is not in her cabin.
where is she?
she's not in your room, not with Christine, and Alice and Anthony are asleep.
now what do we do?
l don't know.
Where's the captain?
how old do you think she was?
don't think about it.
l hope you're around if l die.
wait a minute. -l don't like getting morbid.
l sure hope someone's around.
ls it terrible to wonder if you can get a good hairdresser in this town?
Christine, you don't really need all that for one night ashore.
l've always dreamed of being interrogated in some cellar...
by some slob with steel teeth. And l want to look terrific tomorrow.
Hey, listen. Must be a taxi strike.
lf we don't get to the Majestic, they'll give our rooms away.
l'll be right back, okay?
besides, Guido said he'd take me dancing tonight if l'd pay the check.
lsn't he cute?
l can't tell you how sorry l am. -l know. Are you free later?
listen, darling, thanks for not letting on about us yesterday.
well, l thought
there was enough flak in the air, right? Well, there was.
why don't we cool it for a while, aside from the bad press angle?
let's be honest with each other.
somehow, your being available and my not being, it's not the same.
you'll always be the world's most attractive man.
God, what a thought l just got.
Namely?
lf you get married again, give me a call. lsn't that awful?
see you tomorrow.
goodbyes after an ocean voyage are always so sad.
whose fault is all this?
Clinton's? Lee's?
mine?
or Sheila, for being a tough broad...
who liked to wander around Bel Air at 2: 00 in the morning?
does that make any sense? -Nothing makes any sense.
something Clinton said...
keeps rattling around in the back of my head, if l could remember it.
you'll be at the Majestic?
my invitation was for a week on the yacht.
l didn't bring any pocket money.
l'll see you tomorrow, l guess.
Anthony? -Tom.
what's going on here?
are you waiting for the other members of your coven or what?
l've been calling your hotel. Something's not at all right.
what are you doing?
l'm experimenting.
look at this cigarette. lt's the original stub.
lt's what l went down to ask Lee about last night.
later, l dismissed it from my mind as a whim. But tonight...
lt's the shape.
that bothered me, too.
stamp it out.
now...
try this one. Quickly, just once.
no, let it burn out.
you see, if it's dark and it's awkward for you...
you may stamp on the filter instead of the lit end.
lf you only have one shot at it. -As Clinton did.
lt was in the box where he was killed, after all.
bear with me, please.
now, remember, we both thought this came from the priest's box.
lt doesn't. That wood was carved. This is plain.
lt's from the side grille.
how did it find its way into Clinton's robe?
someone broke the grille.
you're saying, who? -Could we be shy one actor in the piece?
meaning someone who saw the whole thing.
now, none of it would seem quite so sinister...
if it weren't for this.
we found Lee in Clinton's stateroom.
but her cabin was locked from the outside. What could she have locked it with?
the only key to the cabins was in the wheelhouse.
she probably went into the john and out through my cabin.
no, because your door to the bathroom was bolted from the inside.
l had to unbolt it myself.
there's got to be some explanation.
the point is that anybody could have taken the key last night.
then again, maybe Clinton broke the grille, nobody else was there...
and l'm just puttering my way through the debris of my rusty imagination.
he kept whispering.
Where's the ice pick?
that awful, faraway look in his eye.
what? -l said, where's the bloody ice pick?
l don't know. lt was...
lt's been missing since yesterday afternoon.
the back of Clinton's cowl was stained with blood.
of course.
you can't strike a man in the face and the back of the neck with the same blow.
meaning that Lee only thought that she killed Clinton.
did the police examine the body?
what was the point of it? Why bother? She confessed.
Thomas, we've lost our touch.
a good director and a good detective ought to pay more attention to detail.
allow me, please. This is the director's cut.
the important moment happened before Lee came into the chapel.
whoever it was lit a cigarette and dropped it through the grille.
and then, as Clinton leaned forward to stamp it out...
stabbed him in the back of his neck with the ice pick.
then, l assume, he started to leave the field, but...
just give us the news, please.
...the timing was unlucky because Christine entered.
Christine was sitting there last night chattering about the game.
that door creaking open even before l got to it...
and then Clinton getting so physical.
Tom, the door was open when l came into the chapel.
me, too. He wanted it to stay open so everybody could hear the tape.
exactly.
so who closed it? Why did it creak open when Christine came towards it?
because he was trying to get out.
Yes.
he was compelled to improvise. He impersonated Clinton.
but the grille that he had smashed meant that he couldn't let her into the left side.
so he forced open the door at the opposite end.
now, he might have hoped to make a run for it...
but the sprung door meant that Christine...
would have a clear view of anyone trying to sneak out of the chapel.
l happened to notice that when we discovered the body.
small wonder that Clinton had an '"awful, faraway look in his eye. '
then Alice has the homosexual card.
just keep your voice down and get the hell out.
the moment Christine left, he intended to duck out as soon as he possibly could...
but the timing was still unlucky because somebody else came in.;
Lee.
she wasn't going to go until she'd had her showdown with Clinton.
so he drove her into a state of hysteria...
convinced that she'd panic and run. This is taking an awful chance...
because she could have raised her voice enough to draw attention.
but luck was on the murderer's side...
because Lee presented him with the best possible solution.
she exploded.
she killed a dead man.
and needlessly committed suicide.
somebody killed my wife.
not Christine.
Alice? Anthony.
Oh, my God.
Tom... -Hold on, l'll be right back.
l like any game where you don't have to move.
you don't have to for this one if you're smart enough.
no, no, don't throw it away. Keep them till Saturday.
as long as you're fit for Saturday night, which is your biggie.
Saturday? -Yes.
she was AA for a while.
lf you're smart enough.
she was AA for a while.
what did you find?
the beginnings of an idea.
you seem pleased with yourself.
l've had the beginnings of an idea, too, for a scenario.
lt's about a middle-class writer...
who is married to a beautiful and wealthy young woman.
ls this an original or an adaptation?
after a few years, she begins to bore him. Not her money, she herself.
and then, while rewriting a picture in Rome...
he renews his acquaintance with a cheap...
but not untalented young actress.
aren't we getting a little off the subject?
l told you something had been nagging me.
something Clinton had said or done.
he said we didn't have to move to play the game if we were smart enough.
and just now...
l noticed this.
l thought he was being unusually finicky when he was lining us up.
see anything odd?
what's odd?
everybody's been posed under a letter.
so?
now have a look at these secret cards.
there's something peculiar about one of them.
come, Tom, where's that puzzle mind?
'little Child Molester. "
little Child Molester " ? as opposed to what, Big Child Molester?
l still don't get it.
the word, " little. " What's it doing there?
all right.
the first night, the " Shoplifter. " The second night, the " Homosexual. "
we don't know which the third was to be...
but Clinton told you that the hit-and-run killer was to be last.
so let's try the " Ex-convict " next.
and then, just for fun, " lnformer. "
'Sheila. "
clinton needed " little " to give him the " L. "
God knows he could have found six other secrets for us...
but he wanted to make a game for himself, too.
how to find six secrets that formed an appropriate acronym.
the " L " was his only problem.
clever son of a bitch.
cleverer than that. This photograph...
showing the six of us carefully posed...
under each of the initial letters of our assigned secrets.
something in plain view the whole week.
something he could lord over us Sunday morning.
'Shoplifter, Homosexual, Ex-convict...
'lnformer, Little Child Molester.
'Hit-and-run Killer " ?
the last of " Sheila " should be an " A. "
'Hit-and-run " doesn't begin with an " A, " does it, Tom?
lt's a mistake. -Not Clinton's.
l remember something else about the first day.
you started to crumple your card.
this one is smooth.
that was dumb, Tom.
what was your original card?
all right, let me make an educated guess. Something about Lee.
arsonist? No, that doesn't sound like Lee.
adulterer? No, that's you.
'A... " Alcoholic?
that's the secret. Like the others, not too heavy, not too light.
after all, Clinton was only a minor-league sadist.
his aim was to make us uncomfortable, not violent.
as he kept saying, it was only a game.
you made it more than that. You killed him.
why should l want to kill Lee?
Alice.
lee's estate must be worth about $3 million?
$5 million.
you'd always known that she'd killed Sheila, hadn't you?
sure.
l knew it the day l got my statement from Harry's Rent-A-Car.
dented fenders, Vegas.
l didn't have to be a genius to put two and two together.
fade in. Exterior. Day. The yacht, the game.
you get the " Alcoholic " card and realize what Clinton is up to.
not until Alice so generously told me her leopard coat story.
that late?
at any rate...
selecting the ice pick...
a classic woman's weapon...
when did you take it, l wonder?
private finance is not that uncommon now.
can you imagine how Tom would feel about that?
you skipped down to expunge Clinton...
type up a new card that would incriminate Lee...
and toddle off to sleep soundly to await the alarms of the morning.
l should've recognized the hatred on your face outside Clinton's door.
was that to have been the moment of truth?
alas, Clinton and Christine were having their own moment of truth.
dissolve.
the next day, you did substitute the cards...
and arranged for Lee to see the wrong one...
making her think Clinton had sadistic plans to expose her.
the stage was set.
subsequent investigation of the cards would now point to Lee...
as the only person with a motive strong enough for murder.
would you care to explain how l started the propellers with Guido in the room?
that was my contribution.
you wanted Clinton dead, too.
you see, l'd helped Alice...
out of her little unpleasantness those many years ago.
so when we began playing the game, looking for a shoplifter...
l knew some ugly truths would be trotted out.
not in the least mine.
l wanted it stopped.
as you pointed out so astutely yesterday, l blundered...
but it gave you the courage to carry on.
what do you think?
am l gonna get away with it?
you pretended your back was hurting...
to coax Clinton into revealing...
what day your secret would be played.
as long as you're ready for Saturday night, which is your biggie.
lt was only Tuesday. Four days' grace.
clinton's choice of a location was a gift.
but you had to...
make sure that you found him before Lee confronted him with the false card.
so you followed me because l'd been boastful enough to hint...
that l'd figured out the clue.
after my session, you came in...
and proceeded to play Clinton's game as well as your own.
maybe if l open the door to the chapel a little wider?
what the hell?
then you put on your little ventriloquist act...
for Christine and Lee. l should've realized.
we'd all seen you impersonate Clinton.
going over your hand signals for the bridge tournament?
how'd l feel about what?
you know too much to live.
how convenient for you that Lee...
exploded.
but how inconvenient for you that she thought quickly...
and arranged everything to look like an accident.
you must have been furious. So you...
rearranged everything to look like a murder that looked like an accident.
she had picked up the right stone. You replaced it with the wrong one.
l'll bet that other stone, stained with blood, is still in the corner.
as well as the cigarette that Lee actually smoked.
but, no matter, you knew that the next day...
when you conducted your brilliant investigation...
lee would naturally assume that she had made the mistake.
and it was brilliant. What better detective than the man who's committed the crime?
every hesitant conclusion, every stumbling interpretation.
and when you suddenly panicked, protecting your wife...
it was dazzling, dear boy.
lt's after 12: 00 already. -ls it?
good. That gives us plenty of time...
because the crew is happily celebrating the death of their master in the port.
aren't we lucky?
l think so.
lf you're thinking of setting up for another fake suicide sequence...
l must warn you of the dangers of improvisation.
this last exploit had far too many loose ends...
even though you had four days to prepare it.
you even planned for the obligatory confession scene...
the morning after the murder.
you knew that she would need some fortification...
when you started turning the screws.
you felt you were safe because no one else on board drank bourbon...
which, incidentally, you don't pour out of a porthole...
and then toss the bottle overboard. Your pour it down a drain.
unless there's something else you're anxious to get rid of like...
Seconal.
l don't have any gloves.
Hey, you guys, knock it off!
Jesus Christ, look at this place.
actually, we've been having a little difference of opinion.
we've all gotten squirrelly on this trip, but aren't you carrying it a little too far?
about the Last of Sheila project.
but it's all straightened out now.
what are you doing on board? -l'm trying to sleep.
well, not exactly.
guido took over for Vittorio and asked me to keep him company.
so we went into Clinton's room to listen to the stereo...
and instead of getting mood music, we get you guys yakking on the intercom.
dictate it tomorrow when you can get a secretary.
he killed her, she killed him.
that's a good idea...
but we're agreed on the basics, wouldn't you say, Tom?
now that the truths are known...
we've begun to see this as a big project.
there are gigantic themes here, worthy of Dostoyevsky.
there's innocence...
guilt...
hatred...
loyalty.
lee's ambitions for Tom were such that we, as survivors...
feel bound to tell Sheila's story in all its pitiless purity, sparing nothing.
big budget?
l feel $5 million should cover it.
Alice's price just went up.
Tom, nobody can write it better than you. Who handles you again?
actually, l'm keen on having the first draft done by a complete outsider.
someone who will bring a naivete to our little inbred circle.
Tom will be needed as technical advisor. And just before shooting, for a few...
rewrites.
rewrites, exactly.
l think l'll turn in. l'm almost dead on my feet.
so much to do tomorrow...
and still a few pages to type tonight.
sealed letter to my solicitor...
protecting the copyright sort of thing.
ln these perilous times, one can't be too careful.
coming, Christine?
let me hit you with a couple names.
Yul Brynner as Clinton. Paul and Joanne as Tom and Lee.
l hope it's got enough content for them.
who have l got for Alice? l know, Carly Simon!
the soundtrack album alone will pay for her clothes.
now, don't scream. Virna Lisi.
no, darling, as me!
english
now, here's the thing, Sean.
if I'd gotten into that car, I'd be a basket case.
I never would have had the juice to go near her.
and Katie never would have been born.
and she never would have been murdered. You know?
you ever see Dave around? -He married my cousin Celeste.
what time did Katie get home from work yesterday?
around 7: 30.
anything unusual, out of the way about her?
no. She sat with us, with me and the girls, while we ate.
she was having dinner with her friends.
Eve Pigeon and Diane Cestra? - Yeah.
she talked to Nadine about her Communion...
...and then she was on the phone in her room for a bit.
and then around 8, she left.
do you know who she talked to? - No.
do you mind if we have the phone company subpoenaed for records?
no, go ahead. - Good.
you say you spent most of the day Saturday with your daughter in the store, correct?
yes and no. I was mostly in back.
anything odd? A confrontation with a customer, anything?
no, she was herself, she was happy. She
she what?
it's nothing.
listen, the littlest thing could be something right now.
it's just that when she was little, right after her mother died...
...I had just gotten out of prison, she couldn't be by herself.
whether she was crying or not, it didn't matter...
...but she gave a look sometimes, like she was preparing to never see you again.
for a couple of seconds on Saturday, she looked at me that way.
okay. - lt was just a look.
it's information. We collect it, put it together, see what fits. Little things.
you were in prison?
Oh, Jesus. - Here we go.
whitey. - I'm just asking.
sixteen years ago, I did a two- year bit for robbery at Deer lsland.
is that gonna find my daughter's killer? Just asking.
let's forget about that. Let's get back to the point.
sorry. - It's all right. It's all right.
okay, Mr. Markum.
okay. - Okay. All right. So, Jimmy...
...outside of the look Katie gave you, was there anything else?
there was this kid.
what am I talking about? That was this morning.
what? Remember, it's the little things.
this kid Brendan Harris come in the store, like he was expecting to see her.
barely knew each other. - Could they have been dating?
no. - What makes you so sure?
Sean, are you gonna grill me? A father knows.
Mrs. Markum, was Katie seeing anyone?
no one right now, as far as we know.
I mean, knew. - I'll give you whatever you need tomorrow.
we got girls at home wanting to know where their sister is.
all right, there will be a trooper downstairs to take you home.
and if you think of anything...
...anything at all, give us a call.
he said you almost got into a car when you were kids?
shit. Me, Jimmy and a kid named Boyle were playing in front of my house.
this car came up and took Dave away.
abduction? - Yeah, guys pretending to be cops.
convinced Dave to get in the car, kept him for four days before he escaped.
they catch these guys? - One died.
the other got busted, went the noose route in his cell.
your pal Markum, the moment I laid eyes on him, I could tell he'd done time.
they never lose that tension, it settles in their shoulders.
he lost his daughter. That's what's in his shoulders.
no, that's in his stomach. The tension in his shoulders, that's prison.
cause of death: the gunshot wound to the head, not the trauma from the beating.
what else? - Her and her friends were barhopping.
we're interviewing anyone who might have seen them.
one other thing, the backpack in her car...
...had pamphlets on Las Vegas and a list of Vegas hotels.
what do you say, Devine?
we'll get the guy, sir.
that's right. All right, let's do it.
that's the best you can come up with? - lt made him happy, didn't it?
this is Sean.
Hello? - ls it Lauren?
you're in Manhattan. I can tell by the traffic sounds.
is he with you?
is that the baby?
Lauren, at least tell me her name.
Yeah, nice talking to you too.
Hey.
would it surprise you?
wouldn't be the first time.
did you see that girl? Did you see that--?
did you see her?
I heard a car hit something. - Hit what? Another car?
Oh, no, not loud like that. - Like hitting the curb?
Yes, maybe.
then it stalled, and someone said, "Hi."
someone said, "Hi"? - "Hi."
then there was a loud crack.
could it have been a gunshot? - Yes, maybe.
did you look out your window, Mrs. Prior? - Oh, no.
I was in my dressing gown by then.
I don't look out the window in my dressing gown.
the voice you heard, was that a male or a female?
female.
I think.
lt sounds like the girl knew the shooter. - Yeah.
sorry to trouble you.
Jimmy. - Theo.
how's my daughter? How's Annabeth holding up?
she's trying. - Let's get these on ice.
you got a couple of coolers?
right here's fine.
so how are you handling all this so far?
lt hasn't really sunk in, Theo. - Yeah?
it's gonna hurt like hell when it does.
when my Janey died, I was no good for six months...
...but my kids were all grown up. I had that luxury.
you, you got domestic responsibilities.
domestic responsibilities?
Yeah, you gotta take care of my daughter and those girls. That's your first priority.
Oh, you figured that might have slipped my mind?
it just needed to be said, that's all.
you'll come through because you're a man.
like I said to Annabeth, your wedding day.
I said, "You got yourself a real old-school man there.
like they put her in a bag. - What?
that's what Katie looked like when I saw her in the morgue.
like they put her in a bag and then they beat the bag with pipes.
well-- - Janey died in her sleep, all due respect.
she went to sleep, she never woke up. Peaceful.
you don't need to talk about Janey. - My daughter was murdered.
they put a gun to her. As we stand here, she's on an autopsy slab...
...getting cut open by scalpels and chest spreaders...
...and you're talking to me about domestic fucking responsibility?
good to see you, Theo.
Eve, just tell them what they want to know.
who was she dating? - We already told the Savages.
the Savage brothers? - They were here yesterday.
good, now try us out. Who was she dating?
no one special.
you guys were having a goodbye dinner, right?
what? - She was leaving town, wasn't she?
going to Las Vegas? - How do you know?
she closed her bank account, she had hotel phone numbers.
she wanted out of this dump. She wanted to start a new life.
well, a 19- year- old girl doesn't go to Las Vegas alone.
so who was she going with?
come on, girls. Who was she going with?
Brendan.
excuse me?
Brendan. - Brendan Harris?
Brendan Harris, yeah.
you got an address?
Hey, Dave.
Hey, Jimmy.
sorry, I came out for a smoke.
go ahead, sit down. Sit down.
I haven't had a chance to talk to you all day.
how you doing?
how you doing?
what happened to your hand?
this?
I was helping a buddy move a couch. I slammed it in the doorjamb.
ways you can manage to hurt yourself, right?
it's good to see you.
yeah?
how are our girls holding up?
they're doing okay, I guess.
that Celeste, she's a godsend. You thank her for me, will you?
it's nice, isn't it? Just to sit out here.
Yeah.
I couldn't stand looking through the fridge to find room for all that food...
...we're gonna throw away in the next few days.
lot of waste, huh? - Yeah.
I just can't let anything get fucked up in these next few days.
because it's all anybody will remember about her.
one thing you could say about Katie, even when she was little that girl was neat.
when I got out of the joint...
...you know, after Marita died...
...I remember, I was more afraid of my little daughter...
...than I ever was of being in prison.
I loved her...
...most...
...because when we were sitting in that kitchen that night...
...it was like we were the last two people on Earth. You know, forgotten.
unwanted.
and it's really starting to piss me off, Dave, because I can't cry for her.
my own little daughter, and I can't even cry for her.
Jimmy.
you're crying now.
Yeah, damn.
I just want to hug her one more time.
she was 19 fucking years old.
do you want me to leave you alone?
no, just stay here for a minute, if that's cool.
Yeah, sure. Jimmy, it's cool.
when was the last time you saw Katie Markum?
you don't think I'd hurt her do you? -She isn't hurt. She's dead.
I didn't kill her. - Again, when's the last time you saw her?
about 8-- Saturday night, about 8: 00.
about like 8, Brendan, or at 8?
it was about 8.
we had a couple slices at Hi-Fi, and she had to go meet Eve and Diane.
Yeah. Why doesn't Jimmy Markum like you?
I don't know.
but he told Katie he never wanted her to see me or any other Harris.
what? That thief thinks he's better than our family?
he's not a thief. - He's a thief! A scumbag burglar.
daughter probably had the same bad gene. You count yourself lucky, Bren.
so Katie had some brochures for Vegas. We heard she was going there with you.
we were gonna leave Sunday.
we were gonna get married when we got there.
well, that was the plan, right?
you were gonna leave me? Without a word?
ma, I was gonna tell you. - Just like your father, huh?
that's my brother, Ray, and his friend John.
Hey, boys. - Hey.
he don't speak.
father couldn't shut up, but his son's a mute. Oh, yeah, life's fucking fair.
they're here about Katie. Why don't you go watch TV or something.
so where were you between 12: 30 and 2 a. m. on Sunday morning, Brendan?
I was asleep.
can you confirm that, Mrs. Harris?
I can confirm that he closed his door at 1 0: 00.
he came down for breakfast at 9.
I can't confirm that he didn't open his window and go down the fire escape.
okay, we're gonna ask you to take a polygraph. You think you'd be up for that?
I loved her so much.
I'm never gonna feel that again.
it doesn't happen twice.
doesn't happen once most times.
Celeste.
sorry, Jimmy. You surprised me. - What are you still doing here?
I don't know.
I don't know, I just...
did Annabeth get to sleep?
Yeah, I convinced her to take a pill.
could I get one of those? - Yeah.
one for the road and then home.
Jimmy, I can stay over if you want. Sit up with Annabeth.
you've done enough.
to you and Dave for being here for this.
okay, Jimmy. I'll be back.
I'll be by first thing tomorrow. See you first thing.
good night.
good night. - Yeah, good night.
Hello?
Christ. Lauren, say something.
okay. Hey, Sean, how was your day?
Oh, me? I'm tired of wishing things made sense.
I'm tired of caring about some dead girl, and there's just gonna be another one after her.
sending killers to jail is sending them where they've been heading all their lives.
the dead are still dead.
Jesus, l...
...can't do this tonight.
I just...
I can't do it.
Bye, baby.
because...
...sometimes the man wasn't a man at all.
he was the boy.
the boy who escaped from wolves.
an animal of the dusk.
invisible.
silent.
living in a world .the others never saw.
world of fireflies.
unseen except as a flare in the corner of your eye.
vanished by the time you turn your head toward it.
I just gotta get my head right.
catch a nice, long sleep.
and the boy will go back to his forest.
back to his fireflies.
is he asleep?
how's Jimmy and everybody?
okay.
it's weird.
took something like this for me and him to become friends again.
Dave? Dave.
there's still nothing in the paper.
about what?
about what?
I don't know, honey. Maybe I didn't hurt him as bad as I thought.
he's a mugger. He's not going to the hospital.
Yeah.
right.
anyhow, it doesn't matter, does it?
I mean, Katie Markum is dead.
that seems more important right now.
I know in my soul I contributed to your death.
but I don't know how.
Brendan Harris aced his polygraph.
good. I didn't like him for it, nor want him for it.
Yeah. Poor fucking kid.
ballistics will be back in a while. Meantime, we got a list of bar patrons.
all people who, I'm certain, are dying to cooperate.
considering the crime, maybe.
Dave Boyle?
Hey, is that the guy you were friends with as a kid? The car guy?
could be.
he's a guy to talk to. He knows you. He won't treat us like cops.
clam up for no reason, huh? - We'll see.
Hey, Boyle!
what's it been, seven, eight years? - Yeah.
Yeah. How you doing?
this is my son, Michael.
Hey, Michael. How you doing? My name's Sean.
I'm an old buddy of your dad's. Hi.
so you still with the staties? - Homicide. This is my partner.
sergeant Powers. How are you? - So you got a minute?
we'd love to ask some quick questions. - I was just gonna walk Michael to school.
I can be back in a few minutes. - Tell you what, we'll walk with you, okay?
sure.
so you look good.
I hear rents are rising. -Yeah, the yuppies are coming.
they're cutting my dad's old house up into condos.
we walked by there the other day.
must be something we could do to stop them.
a friend of mine says the other day, he says:
neighborhood needs a fucking crime wave. Get property values where they belong.
young girls keep getting murdered up in Pen Park, Mr. Boyle, you might get your wish.
Dave. Call me Dave.
you said the F-word, Dad.
Yeah, I know. Walk on up ahead, Michael.
us guys need to talk. Go on.
so, what's up, Sean? - Yeah, you heard about Katie Markum?
Yeah, I was at Jimmy's yesterday. Celeste is there now.
who's Celeste? - My wife.
how's Jimmy doing? - It's hard to tell. You know him.
Yeah, so the reason we came by-- - Listen, I saw her.
Katie. I don't know if you know that. At McGill's, the night she died.
that's what we wanted to talk about.
they were at a couple of bars that night. Your name turned up for McGill's.
they put on quite a show dancing on the bar.
pretty drunk, huh? - But it was harmless.
they weren't stripping or nothing. They were just 19.
what time did they leave?
I left at 1. They must've left 15 minutes before me.
so we'll say 12: 45? -Sounds about right.
you see anything unusual or anyone--?
Michael.
like what? - I don't know.
a guy watching the girls?
a guy with hate in his eyes? A woman-hater?
no. No, if they hadn't danced on the bar, it would've been business as usual.
see you later, Dad. - You got your milk money?
fuck, I hated school.
what?
Yeah, me too, Sean.
just one more thing, Mr. Boyle. Where did you go after you left McGill's?
home. - Home by 1: 15, would you say?
roughly. Sure. - All right.
Yeah, well, thanks a lot, Dave. We'll grab a beer sometime?
Yeah, I'd like that, Sean. - All right.
what?
what happened to him in that car?
can you believe this?
man, it's the same as Dunkin'Donuts. It costs 15 times the price.
you know, you take away love, money or hate as motives...
...you're not left with a whole lot.
well, if this Markum thing's random, I mean, shit.
Yeah, tell me about it. But the old lady, Prior, she doesn't hear a scream.
hears a gunshot, before that a "hi..."
...which tells me the girl is either friendly or she knew him.
she turns into the curb, not too fast or she hops it. Foot's off the clutch. She stalls.
she says, "Hi." He shoots her. -She slams the door into him, takes off.
what makes her swerve without hitting the brakes?
I don't know. Something in the street. -Maybe.
this Markum girl couldn't have weighed more than what, 110?
she hit hard enough to get a jump on him? -Maybe he's knocked back on his heels.
your pal Dave strikes me as a guy permanently back on his heels.
wait a second, how did we get to Dave Boyle all of a sudden?
we just got to him. - He's a guy who was in the bar.
the last place, Seany, the last place she was at.
the guy is wrong. You saw his hand.
Yeah, I saw his hand. You seriously want to take a look at Dave Boyle?
just a little one.
I'd recommend two sets of visiting hours, from 3 to 5, and 7 to 9.
sure. - Good.
have you thought about flowers? -I'll call Knopfler's this afternoon.
good.
and the notice?
notice?
Yes, the obituary. We can take care of it if you give us her basic information.
or if you prefer donations in lieu of flowers?
Where's my daughter?
downstairs, in the basement.
I wanna see her.
I'm gonna find him, Katie.
I'm gonna find him before the police do.
I'm gonna find the man, and I'm gonna kill him.
did you say something, Mr. Markum?
the notice.
it should read: "Katherine Markum...
...beloved daughter of James and Marita, deceased...
...stepdaughter of Annabeth, sister to
sister to Sara and Nadine.
you guys again? - Yeah. We're like two bad pennies.
you dropping in on Jimmy? - Yeah.
do you have some kind of, what, break in the case?
no, just paying our respects. Where you off to?
Annabeth got a craving for cigarettes. I'm gonna go get some. See you in a minute.
by the way, Mr. Boyle, what happened to your hand there?
garbage disposal. It jammed, I stuck my hand in, it started again.
stupid. - Painful.
garbage disposal. Bullshit.
Yeah. Well, it doesn't mean he killed anybody either. Come on.
heard you could use one. - Thanks.
I quit 10 years ago, you believe this? - Whatever you need right now.
come on in, I'll get Jimmy.
I got a couple errands I gotta run. I'll be back in an hour.
you don't have to come back, Celeste. I'll be fine.
sure? - Celeste Boyle?
Yeah.
I'm Sean Devine, an old friend of Dave's. This is Whitey Powers.
Mrs. Boyle. - Nice to meet you.
look, I gotta go.
Oh, damn it. I left my report pad in the cruiser.
you better go get it. - Yeah.
come on.
Hey, Celeste, could I ask you a quick question?
me? - What time did Dave get home on Saturday?
what? - It's a little thing.
we're running a time line on everything involving Katie. I'm sure...
...Dave told you he saw her at McGill's.
you think Dave killed Katie?
Oh, no. God. I didn't say that. Why would I even think that?
I don't know. - No, no. It's just that we could figure out...
...what time she was on the road if we knew what time Dave got home.
see, it's 5 minutes from your place to McGill's...
...and Katie left 1 5 minutes before Dave did. You see what I mean.
I was asleep.
Saturday night, when Dave came in, I was asleep.
okay. Well, thanks.
bullshit.
no, he was dating Katie, Jim.
they were gonna elope to Vegas. We found tickets under their names.
Brendan Harris confirmed it.
remember what you said?
how she looked at you on Saturday like she was preparing to never see you again?
did Brendan Harris kill my daughter? - No.
you're 100 percent sure?
passed his poly with flying colors, plus it seemed to me like he really loved her.
Jimmy, I'm just curious, man.
why are you so dead set against that kid?
he said Katie told him you'd disowned her if she ever dated a Harris.
I knew his father. They called him "Just Ray" Harris.
why is that?
there were so many Rays in the neighborhood.
you had "Crazy Ray" Bucheck, " Psycho Ray" Dorian.
the cool names were taken, so he got stuck with "Just Ray.
we never got along. I flat out didn't like him.
and he cut out on his wife when she was pregnant with that little mute of hers.
I don't know.
I just figure the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
I didn't want Brendan or any other Harris dating Katie or any other daughter of mine.
I can't believe we're talking about Just Ray Harris.
how about this? We've interviewed witnesses...
...canvassed people who were in the bar.
we've run into more than a few of them who were questioned...
...before us by one or more of the Savage brothers.
so? -So the Savages are not policemen, Jim.
some people don't talk to policemen, Sean. -With all due respect...
...and just so we're clear, this is our case.
how long? - How long what?
how long before you catch my daughter's killer?
you bargaining with us?
bargaining?
you giving us a deadline?
we'll speak for Katie, Mr. Markum. If that's okay with you.
just find my daughter's killer, sergeant. I'm not standing in your way.
the last thing we need is Markum and the Savages putting the fear of God...
...into the neighborhood. - We grew up terrified of them.
eleven months apart, like their mother ran a loose- cannon factory.
fucking knuckleheads.
ballistics are in on the Markum murder.
Yeah, you got a match? - You're gonna love it.
it's a perfect match. Gun was a. 38 Smith.
part of a lot stolen from a gun dealer in New Hampshire in 1 982.
the same gun that killed Katherine Markum was used in a liquor-store holdup in 1 984.
ln Buckingham. - The Flats?
Rome Basin. Place called Looney Liquors. I pulled the file.
it was a two- man job. They fired a warning shot into a wall.
that's where the bullet got pulled. - Nice work.
thought you'd like that.
it's okay, Ray.
don't worry about it.
ma said that?
that I'm better off?
I loved her! You know what that's like?
huh?
I'm sorry.
no, you're wrong.
I won't ever feel that again.
right there. Went in through a bottle of Jack and stuck in the wall right there.
scary, huh? - Scarier than a glass of milk, right?
so take me through it. These two guys come in...
in rubber masks. They came in through here.
that's the storeroom.
there's a door back there that leads to a loading dock.
I always keep that door locked.
so they must have had a key.
a key? So, what you're saying is that it was an inside job?
it had to be. One of them, at least, worked for me at some point.
the only reason they fired that goddamn warning shot was they must have known...
...I kept this under the counter.
and you told the police that at the time. -Yeah.
sure, they went through my employment records.
questioned everybody who used to work for me.
never made an arrest. -Still have a copy of those records?
Yeah, it's in a box in the office there. But I know who did it.
Oh, yeah?
this guy I fired a couple of weeks before.
son of a bitch came in here a few days after the robbery.
he had this fucking goddamn grin on his face.
and I just knew.
go tell a grin to a jury, right?
you remember his name?
do I look senile to you?
no, sir. - Name...
...was Ray Harris.
we used to call him "Just Ray."
you say they used the same gun for another crime?
that's correct, sir. - Thanks for your help, Mr. Looney.
where you been?
out.
what you watching?
some vampire movie.
guy just got his head torn off.
Where'd you go, Celeste?
I was sitting in my car...
...down by the channel. You know...
...thinking about things.
What'd you think about? - Oh, you know...
no, actually, I don't know.
things. You know, the day.
about Katie being dead.
and poor Annabeth and Jimmy, you know...
...those things.
those things.
know what I was thinking about, huh?
vampires.
what about them?
they're undead...
...but I think maybe there's something beautiful about it.
maybe one day you wake up and you forget what it's like...
...to be human. Maybe then it's okay.
what the fuck you talking about, Dave?
vampires, sweetie. Werewolves.
you're not making any sense.
you think I killed Katie?
Celeste. - What--?
ls that the sense we're making these days? -Where'd you come up with that?
you've barely looked at me since you found out Katie was dead.
in fact, you seem repulsed by me.
Dave! - What?
I don't think anything. I'm confused, okay?
even your friend Sean asked about
he's not my friend, if you didn't know.
he asked me about you. What time you came home.
What'd you tell him? - I said I was asleep.
that's good thinking, baby. - Jesus Christ, Dave!
why don't you tell them about the mugger? - The mugger?
the mugger! I see how your mind's working. I do.
I come home with blood on me the same night Katie's murdered.
I must have killed her, right?
fuck!
Henry...
what? Henry?
Henry and George.
I never told anyone that before.
those were their names.
isn't that fucking hilarious?
at least that's what they called themselves, but...
...they were wolves, and Dave...
...was the boy who escaped from wolves.
what are you talking about, Dave?
I'm talking Henry and George.
they took me on a four-day ride.
they buried me in this ratty old cellar with a sleeping bag.
and, man, Celeste...
...did they have their fun.
and no one came to help old Dave then.
Dave had to pretend to be somebody else.
you mean, all those years ago...
...when you were a little boy?
Dave...
Dave's dead.
I don't know who came out of that cellar, but it sure as shit wasn't Dave!
you see, honey
fuck!
it's like vampires.
once it's in you...
...it stays.
what stays?
did you know there were child prostitutes in Rome Basin?
what?
fuck!
I can't trust my mind anymore, Celeste.
I'm warning you...
...I can't trust my mind.
I gotta go out, try to get my head around it.
okay.
okay.
okay.
the gun sends us in a different direction. - I don't see it that way.
what does Just Ray's gun have to do with Dave?
these things get passed around.
just Ray may have blown town, but his gun never did.
I say we talk with Brendan Harris in the morning.
and I say Dave Boyle. The hand story. The wife, she's definitely scared.
they're hiding something, but Dave Boyle's as much a killer as Brendan Harris.
boyle fits the profile, a fucking T. Mid- 30s, white, marginally employed...
...sexually abused as a kid. On paper, this guy should be in jail already.
Katie Markum was not sexually abused, see?
in that equation, sexual emission is part of the deal.
you were friends when you were kids. This makes you a fucking liability.
he's not my friend.
turns out you're right, I'll have my cuffs off my hip faster than yours.
Hey, Jimmy.
you're out late.
Yeah, you too.
it's cold, huh?
Yeah, I guess.
you know, l...
I been sitting out here...
...over the last few years...
...waiting on Katie to get back from someplace.
about midnight, I'd say to Annabeth, "I'm gonna go sit on the porch for a while."
weird thing is...
...it seemed to bring her back.
I saw her, you know.
saw who?
Katie. I was at McGill's Saturday night.
you saw Katie Saturday night? - Never got around to telling you.
did you talk to her?
just nodded hello at one point.
next time I looked up, she was gone.
but...
...Jimmy...
...she looked...
...happy.
I got more walking to do. Good night.
you stole his car. - His car was officially towed.
from the front of his house. -No! It was abandoned in Rome Basin...
...adjacent to the parkway.
lucky for us, the parkway's state jurisdiction. Some kids jacked the car...
...they took it for a joy ride... - What? Why'd you do it?
after I left you last night, I decided to talk to Boyle myself, put some fear into him.
I get to his house, I decide to look in his car, see what he's got. I find blood.
blood? -Front seat of Dave's car. B-negative.
how much? - A bit. Found more in the trunk. A lot more.
type O, same type as Katie Markum.
wait, Katie Markum never got in anybody's trunk.
she was chased through the park where she died.
it's enough to ask questions. - Your search is gonna get tossed out.
no, found and abandoned in state jurisdiction, for insurance purposes.
ln the best interest of the owner. -Get a physical search, file the report.
bingo.
you wanna talk to him, or should I send him home?
Dave's here? - I've had him in the box for an hour.
sent two of my biggest, ugliest troopers to pick him up.
come on, Mr. Boyle!
we know you didn't get that swollen hand sticking it in the garbage disposal.
Oh, yeah? How do you know that? -Why's your wife afraid of you?
she know what really happened to your hand?
how about a Sprite or something?
how about you tell us what really happened Saturday night, Mr. Boyle?
you lied.
that's your opinion, which you're entitled to.
Hey, you think this is funny? - No, I don't. I'm tired, I'm hung-over.
not only was my car stolen last night, but now you won't release it to me.
okay.
all right.
tell us, Mr. Boyle, how did you get the blood in your car?
what blood? - Let's start with the front seat.
what are you looking at him for?
Hey, you think I could get that Sprite, Sean?
sure.
Oh, I get it.
you're the good cop.
how about a meatball sub while you're at it?
I ain't your bitch, Dave. Looks like you'll have to wait.
Yeah, but you're someone's bitch, aren't you, Sean?
the blood on your front seat, Dave. Answer the sergeant.
we got a chainlink fence in our back yard.
me and my kid play Wiffle Ball every afternoon after school.
he's getting good, so most of the balls are on the other side of the fence.
so I climb it. Except I slip...
...slice myself where the links curl in, right here.
bled like hell.
ten minutes later, I gotta pick up Michael at school.
probably was still bleeding when I got in the front seat.
what blood type are you?
B-negative.
yeah? That's the match we got.
well, there you go. - Not quite.
blood in the trunk of the car wasn't B- negative.
I don't know anything about any blood in the trunk.
no idea how half a pint of blood got in the trunk?
none. - This is not the way you wanna go, Dave.
how will that look in court?
you not knowing how someone else's blood got in the trunk of your car?
gonna look fine, I suppose. You filed the report.
what report?
the stolen- car report. The car wasn't in my possession last night.
so whatever the thieves used it for, you should find out...
...because it sounds like they were up to no good.
things looking any better on the Sprite, Sean?
well, you just got too fucking smart. The car is inadmissible.
anything there, his lawyers say was put by thieves.
I can break him. - He just kicked our asses!
you still think Dave wouldn't hurt a fly
ls that the point? No. - What is the point?
we can break this open on the gun. It's the gun.
okay. Maybe.
so, what do we do with Dave?
fuck it. Kick him loose.
maybe a Celtic cross. That's always a popular choice.
or this lovely red marble here.
or a figural.
that one.
very good. Nice and simple.
Hey, Jimmy!
Annabeth said you were here.
we been asking around, like you said to.
yeah? -Yeah.
Jimmy, this ain't about the two-year bit you did for me.
and it ain't about me missing your brains running things.
Katie was my niece. Not by birth, but she was part of our family, we loved her.
I don't question you, Val. What's up?
cops are all over this. Doing their job for once. Bars, street trade, everything.
every hooker we talked to, bartender, already been questioned.
the fucking law has descended, Jimmy. - What about Just Ray's kid?
quiet as a mouse. Kid's no trouble to anyone.
I talked to Diane and Eve. They said he loved her.
Jimmy, they said that she loved him.
want us to take a run at him? - No.
hold off for now. Anything else?
what?
Val, you wanna spit something, spit it.
tell him.
Sean Devine and his partner went by and saw Dave Boyle.
Dave was at McGill's. Probably questioning him like everybody else.
I heard something else this morning too.
two staties came by in uniform. - Maybe they forgot to ask him something.
no. When they left, they took him with them.
they put him in the back seat, if you know what I mean.
my mother was always the nicest person l ever knew.
she was the nicest, sweetest woman than anyone who knew her ever knew.
then things changed...
then she changed.
she got angry. Good and angry.
anger has turned my mother into a very sad and bitter woman.
lf she wasn't my mother, l'd slap her.
l would.
l'd look her straight in the face and tell her what l really think of her...
and then l'd run really fast in the opposite direction.
are you eating? - Yes.
l want you eating. l mean it.
okay.
you ladies are old enough now, l'm not gonna pull any punches here.
he took his wallet...
and he left.
when he didn't come home the other night, you know, l thought we got lucky and he was just in a car crash, dead by the side of the road, but the fact is, he's run off with his little Swedish secretary, who, oh, what a coincidence, mysteriously left work three days ago and moved back to Sweden!
but where did he go? Have you spoken to him?
no, l haven't spoken to him.
there is very little to say.
he knows that. But l did cut off all his goddamn credit cards.
closed his checking account, yeah.
see how long she sticks around when he's broke.
your father is a...
small man.
very small.
l hope that's not an allusion to the man's genitals - cause that's just be gross. - Aw, dude, - l was about to eat a string bean. - Oh, my god
excuse me, excuse me. Everything is not a joke.
l am talking.
and as a jittery nation worries about a counterstrike, we'll go to the scene of the anthrax scare in Florida.
Sheesh.
Hey. Hey, Terry.
what do you want?
well, l-l...
l wanted to talk to you and Grey about them building that subdivision back there?
yeah? - He's so, um
he's so damned set against it, he hasn't even heard the proposal.
grey doesn't live here anymore, Denny.
he doesn't exist.
go away.
officials tell us that they are worried about how to manage the fragile US-led coalition in the days ahead, but the facts are already evident from south Asia, to Africa, to the Middle East.
worldwide, thousands of angry demonstrators are taking to the streets to protest US military
the least he could have done was taken this stupid jock with him.
there have been plenty of protests in the world.
and l suspect...
Ugh.
what-- what
what do you mean, " He doesn't exist " ?
Oh.
are you stoned?
Yeah. - Oh... Jesus.
what do you-- what do you mean, " He-- he doesn't exist?
he's been messing around with his assistant.
go talk about it on the radio.
no, l'm-- l'm-- no, l'm-l'm-- l'm-l'm be
l'm being serious. l need-- l need to talk to him.
um...
he left me.
he left you? - Mm. For Danken Shane or whatever his secretary's name is, so Denny you can go ahead and build your...
damn subdivision back there
l don't know, whatever it is you want.
lt was him who had the problem with it, not me, okay?
he left you? - Yes.
Really? - Yeah.
Hey, l'm sorry, Terry.
you know, go ahead and build your houses back there, Denny.
he's gone. He won't stop-- - They're not my houses.
they're not. l'm just, um
l'm just the front man, you know, wave the World Series ring.
they get the sales, l'm getting a free lot out of it.
Ooh, a free lot.
hmm. - lt's something Shep set up.
he really left? Really?
this is... true?
Yeah.
Hey, come on. Just go away.
Hey. Well-- ah-- look, let me come in.
come on, if yo-- if you don't want, l won't talk. l'll just sit there and l'll drink with you.
there was a large mob...
of angry demonstrators here today, proving that a number of people are willing to go and fight.
the feeling is that-- - l got her to school.
thank you.
you know l'm going back to school in the morning, you're gonna get her yourself tomorrow.
Billy Edwards on my bus says that when you get really drunk, you get friendly and you sign baseballs without bitching about it.
he does? - Yeah.
so, you got any baseballs around?
no.
why don't you run down the street to my house.
l got a...
stack of boxes in my garage. There's a key under my mat.
you grab one of those boxes. You bring it back here.
one box.
anything she makes...
l'm gonna split with her.
buddy, Goddamn you! Out!
what's the big deal? He wasn't licking it more than three seconds.
the three second thing is for floors, not dog's mouths.
he spends all day licking other dog's asses.
Oh, let's just call for take-out.
lt's fine. You guys, it's good chicken. lt's fine.
like you'd eat it?
lt's fine.
you know the Milwaukees' Great Dane, "Mofo?"
you're licking his asshole right now.
you know what, that's really sick.
how's dinner coming?
good. We made your favorite.
chicken. - Thank you.
um, can you make an extra plate? Denny is staying for dinner.
that was quick.
what was quick?
what was quick?
please...
give me more credit than that, Hadley. He is a drunk.
you make a nice couple.
my life is falling apart at this moment.
l expect some compassion from you.
now you go back up to school tomorrow, come back home at Christmas break and bust my hump if you want to, but right this minute, l want the benefit of the doubt at every turn!
are we clear?
Yes.
thank you.
mm, this looks good.
what kind of a dick-head runs away with his secretary?
that is lame. Take a right, make a left at pathetic.
l think he will come back home.
maybe not soon, but... l do.
l think we should call him.
and say what?
hey dad, how's your new life going so far?
l got an A in interpretive dance. "
he doesn't care about you, Emily. Get real.
he lost his job, Hadley.
what? - Your father was about to be laid off.
he was told a few months ago.
he was devastated. He didn't want you girls to know it.
okay? l think he flipped out or something.
l read this article on the internet. Apparently, it's common.
they lose their jobs, and they go nuts.
what do you want from me?
lt's the best that l can come up with.
l don't want anything from you.
well, don't take it out on me, Hadley. You aren't gonna have to be here.
you aren't gonna know how empty this house is gonna be.
well, if it makes you feel any better, l hate him too.
Oh, does that mean you hate me?
you are such a mental.
l have to go, okay?
all right.
l'll see you later, okay?
Hey.
listen to my show today, okay?
l'll mention you.
l'm gonna bring you up as a drinking buddy - l watched the invasion with. - l don't want you to do that, Denny.
l know, but. you don't have a choice.
Yeah, l do. l don't want to be mentioned on the radio.
you don't want to be mentioned?
she cried more, more, more! - No.
okay.
Oh God.
Hey, come on! Slow down!
there's children playing here! - Sorry, sorry, sorry!
there's children playing here! - Sorry!
and now, once again,
detroit's own legendary Denny Davies.
okay, it's the Denny Davies show.
and if you're a regular listener, and you've just tuned in, you know that you haven't missed much.
and you know that's the beauty of the show, right, Shep?
you can always just jump right in here with us - because-- - Because nothing ever happens.
nothing ever happens, exactly
now what were we talking about just before the commercial?
Oh yeah. The invasion, right?
see? - Right?
you still do have your memory. - Yeah.
l know what people are saying. Were you watching TV?
as a matter of fact, l was watching it with my drinking buddy the very sweet, the very tall and absolutely sexy
but you-- but you know what?
what? - She doesn't want me to talk about her, so l'm not gonna do it. l'm not gonna talk about her.
not gonna talk about who?
l get it. We're not even mentioning Terry Ann Wolfmeyer's name.
Nope. - ls that the game that you're playing?
not even gonna bring her up. - Terry Ann Wolfmeyer.
you're getting no play. - On 101 WRlF Detroit.
you're listening to the Denny Davies show.
what l don't get, is how come you won't talk about baseball?
with all they pay you every year, what's with you not talking about base
Hey, guess what, guess what, pinhead?
they don't pay me that much.
he just got flushed.
okay, that's
that's it for me folks, the Poobah's up next,
big Daddy Arthur P.
but l'll be with you tomorrow, and you can all call in give me hell, the radio equivalent of dunking the clown...
into the water.
WRlF Detroit at 5: 00
that wasn't too bad, was it, Shep?
wasn't too... vicious?
no, you were mild today. You probably only lost about 6 or 7, 000 listeners.
you should feel really good about yourself.
Hey, but what was all that about?
all what? - That whole thing about the woman you watched the invasion with? Who's she?
just a girl.
Yeah, she's one of the 20-year-olds, isn't she?
from the college thing. The one l got you.
no.
no, she's not 20. She's nowhere near 20.
ln fact, look, don't superimpose your warped thinking onto my life, okay?
l got enough problems.
okay, well, then while we're at it, don't knock my dating habits, okay?
cause they keep me young.
l happen to be a walking encyclopedia of every boy-band that ever existed.
trust me, you don't get that from dating Arianna Huffington.
did you, uh, find out about that, uh, mall opening in Toledo?
what it's price was? - Yeah, $10, 000.
$10, 000 for you to show up for one-half an hour.
you know, it must suck for you... - You're going.
...not, uh, being me. - Yeah, almost as much as it must suck - actually being you. - And now, your Rock and Roll - radio chaperone of Detroit-- - Go home.
seriously. l've got a real disc jockey to produce.
my impression of you in about 15 minutes.
that was said with love.
Where's Mom?
she's upstairs taking a shower.
what are you working on?
what are you looking in the want-ads for?
a job.
l need to work. l'm not going to college.
okay.
lt's okay with me, l guess.
thank you.
what are you gonna do? - l want to be a reporter.
a newscaster. - Well, you have the face for it.
Oh. Are you staying for dinner?
depends.
lf you're making any more of that chicken, l am.
here you go.
a little something to get you into second gear.
what are you doing?
l wasn't looking, relax.
get out! Jesus!
l get out, l'm taking this drink with me.
have you ever heard of boundaries?
okay, that's it.
l'm drinking them both.
give me the drink.
l-l wasn't looking.
all right? l, uh...
l didn't see much.
all right, well... what are you doing here?
what do you want? - Well, little Emily invited me...
for dinner.
she did? - Yes, she did, and l think you know my position on free food.
which one of you recites Brownie?
come on, your mother told me once that one of you recites Brownie, beautifully.
Oh. Browning,
Elizabeth Barrett Browning and l was telling you that...
um... Popeye, a few years back when you were like, l don't know, nine or 10 or so.
l had her read Browning and she used to commit some of the poems to memory and recite them here at the dinner table.
that's right.
that's what it was. That sounds
that sounds good.
l've never heard anything like it before but it-- it sounds fun.
to who?
to all of us, if she can remember.
can we do this tomorrow night when l've had notice and can make plans to eat somewhere else?
l don't remember any of them anyway.
l do.
you do? - Yeah.
Really? Wow.
l'm impressed.
good. You should be.
what's so funny?
nothing. Just
you're just all-- l don't know...
very female.
l got her number in Sweden... from Helen Trailer.
lt forwards and l...
called last night.
lt must been the middle of the night there.
lt was Grey that answered. l'm sure of it.
Yeah. l hung up like a six-year-old.
Ah, he'll marry her. l'd bet any money in the world.
what do you think you'll do?
eh, what can l do?
well, you're set up, right?
right?
l mean Grey's got to be pretty chunky in the money department, - plus, you have-- - l have, what?
bills? Responsibilities?
four girls? One that hates me, two or three that are leaning that way.
you can have your damn lots back there, Denny.
l'm not here for the lots.
then leave.
any other reason than that for you to be here, frankly, is just pitiful.
are you okay? - No.
l'm a wreck.
she's gonna take us to school.
you see women...
on TV, in the movies, and they get left or whatever.
you just wanna kick them, they're so whiny.
look at me.
l hate his guts. l hate his guts for what he's done.
Oh.
he's a pig, your dad.
just a vile, selfish, horrible pig, but you know what?
l'm not gonna trash him to you girls.
l'm not.
l hate him too.
l hate him so much.
l know you do, baby.
you're human. How could you not?
all right. See you. - For the last...
Hey, hey, wait.
who is that?
he's cute.
that's Gorden Reiner. He's new.
he's from Chicago.
go meet him. - Yeah.
l met him. He's not interested in me.
all he likes to talk about is bungee jumping.
tell him you're from a broken home.
l'm serious. - Should l?
guys think things like that are great.
trust me. l'm gonna use it.
Hi, Gorden.
Hey.
did you know l'm from a broken home?
okay, bye.

Wolfmeyer residence - Hey, beautiful.
lt's Denny.

bingo. You still looking for work?
l am. - Well, l want you to come in tomorrow.
and see Shep Goodman from my show.
he needs a production assistant.
Denny, you're kidding me.
you're amazing. - Yeah...
well, you tell that to your mom, we're even.
so you come in tomorrow, okay? l'll set you two up.
okay! Thank you so much!
Oh my God.
l might get a job working on Denny's show.
are you kidding me? - No!
that would be amazing! - That would be so cool.
Oh my God. - What's up?
Denny just called. She might get a job on his show.
Oh, really? Denny just called here?
Yeah, l have an interview tomorrow for a job.
wait, wait. What about school?
l want a job.
l'm not going to college.
wha-- you're not going to college?
no, l told daddy and he wanted me to wait to tell you, but now
Oh, but now that he's off screwing his assistant, you think you can safely drop the bomb on me, is that it?
no.
"no" is right. You are going to college!
you know damn well how l feel about this.
all four of you. You're all goddamn going to college!
l don't have a job open.
lt's that simple, Denny. lt's cut and dry.
this girl has something.
she does, Sheppy, she's sharp.
she has class.
you could be hiring the next, um... Diane Sawyer.
l don't have a job open.
l know you don't, but you could do this for me, right? You could do this for me.
no, l can't. Wanna know why?
Yes, why? - Okay, l'm gonna come in there.
l'm gonna tell you. Hold on.
Jesus.

"my lord"?
Hi.

um... Denny Davies asked me to come in.
Oh, okay. Well, if you'd like to take a seat over there.

l've got an opening. Something's come up.
l found an opening.
l'm on the phone. - Okay.
lf you want her to have the job, l'll make it happen.

whatever it is you super sports heroes call it.
l mean are you looking to get lucky with me

No! Uh, no, l mean

no, there, uh
there's not a lot of light here.

Shep's in some kind of trouble. - Oh, yeah.

no, l'm not. - Yes, you are.
l'm not and...
in fact, l'd like a rain check.
lt's not gonna happen.

Hello, Andy. - This is Arthur Pennhallow.
he is a big deal here in town. - Yeah.

Yeah, "Andrea." - Cool. See? l'm good with names.
Yeah.

Wow.
kids, hurry up! You're gonna be late!
how's your lunch, Gordon? - lt's good.
did you ever see that documentary on the Chicago Seven?
what about the one
the one about the Kent State killings?
no. - Something like...
six people were killed by the cops, there was all this turmoil and it got really ugly and just opened up a lot of old wounds between the police and the people of the area.
l'm from a broken home also.
you are?
Hey, do you bungee jump?
no. - Well, l do.
l go up with my dad.
we drive up north to Fenton Valley...
and bungee jump off this huge crane. - That sounds exciting.
well, l read your letter.
was it too mean?
l don't want it to be mean.
well, l mean l do, but l don't.
well, he's your father and he's...
left you at a very tough time.
l know and l want him to know that it pisses me off he hasn't called.
Oh, he knows.
he's not talking to his brother or his friends at work.
he knows what he has done.
are you gonna call him?
please?
this is stupid. lt's just a stupid game.
you said you have his number.
this letter is good. l mean, it's good for you to get your feelings out.
um...
l want you eating, though.
you are dancing so much.
do you think maybe it's too much?
l know you have this out here. Daddy built it for you, - but you spend so much time out here. - You're such a head case.
what? - Be happy for me.
be proud! Shit!
you know? l'm focused! What is your problem?
the only thing you're focused on is drinking and Denny!
be glad that l have a dream!
l was just going to tell you how proud l am of you.
that's the sad thing.
what?
well, l'm not going to now.
not after that outburst.
fine, l don't care.
l'm in the kitchen making dinner, and it wouldn't kill you to come up and help.
who knows? You may get there just in time to pull my head out of the oven.
Hello? - What-- what are you doing?
Oh, making the girls' lunches. - Good for you.
Yeah, what the hell. l'm going after the Mother-of-the-year award.
see, um...
you know what l was thinking? - No.
maybe it's been... 57 years.
what are you talking about? - Halley's Comet, you know?
by the way, it's, uh...
76 years, but l'll give you that one, smarty pants.
can l come over?
when?
now.
now? - Yeah, now.
did you hang up? - Uh, not yet.
good, then, um... l'm coming over.
l am, so...

look, um...
l'm coming over. l am.
l'm coming now.
hold it. Hold it!
wait, wait, wait.
what is this? - Your lunches.
our lunches? - Mm-hmm.

you haven't done it in years.
l'm back to basics. What do you want?
Bye. - Have a good day!
No!
Oh, shit. Great.
were you-- you taking off?
Hey. You're taking off, just like that?
Yeah, l'm going to hide in your yard.
Oh, come on, that's bullshit. l was kidding.
what are you doing? - Step out.
just step out.
are you stoned? - Not at all.
not a bit. - Well, you should be.
listen, l, uh...
l know that you're fresh. l know you're good and hurt and l know that on some level, this is way too soon...
and not right. - Yeah.
what's the other level?
l dial your number 10 times a day and hang up.
come on!
just a minute.
goddamn, Terry, it's not like, you know, it's not like l'm asking a lot.
lt's just
it's just
l get it, okay?
l know who l am for you.
l'm this guy that you sit and you drink...

Oh, God.

Aw...
that was a sweet thing to say.
God, what am l doing?
why am l here?
you're here because you're sad and lonely.
desperate.
you need someone, something, anything to fill you. Any...
port in a storm. - Mm.
l asked why l was here, not you.
what's my story?
Oh, your story is...
you're good and bent out of shape.
pissed off like l've never seen a woman.
what?
lt's a special day for her. So, just be nice.
she's excited for you to meet him. - Oh, really, how excited can she be? She's been seeing him for three years.
and she's in love? She's in love?
l'm just hearing about this today? - Be nice!
lt's not in my nature. Why does she hate me so damn much?
she doesn't hate you, she just thinks that he's stupid.
she thinks he is stupid?! l thought she loved him.
no, she thinks you'll think he's stupid.
well, l won't think that. That's my point.
she judges me so harshly. l am her mother.
okay. - l love her. l want her to be happy.
l mean, if she loves this guy l'm gonna love
okie dokie. - Hi! Hi! Oh, baby!
baby!
Oh God, l'm so proud of you! l am!
l am so proud of you.
let me see your face. - Mother.
a college graduate. l'm so proud of you.
your father doesn't know what he's missing today.
l think he might. Mm-mmm!
this is it. This is life.
mom?
David. Hi, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too.
my parents are having lunch at the Wheeler hotel.
you're all invited. - The Wheeler, really?
We'd-- well, girls, would you like that?

david you tell your folks we'd absolutely love to join them, okay?
cool. Okay, see you later. - See you later.
Bye.
Wow.
he is so handsome.
nice and...
intelligent. - Mother.
Oh! He is, baby. l can tell by looking at him.
he's incredibly intelligent.
all right... um...
there's something you all should know.
you're pregnant and you're getting married.
how did you know that? Who told you that?
l guessed? Really?
l guessed that? l was right?
no, you've got to be kidding me.
no, l'm-- l'm not.
l'm getting married.
this is how l find out?
through Popeye? A 15-year-old?
don't be condescending-- - Close it!
you are a child. What do you know?
Oh, that old chestnut.
you close it as well, please.
do his parents know?
Yes, they're ecstatic.
Oh, how long have they been ecstatic?
you know what, can we just go to the lunch please?
how long have they been ecstatic, damn you, Hadley?!
l need a Bloody Mary as soon as is humanly possible.
Hi. l'm Terry.
Oh. Gina. Nice to meet you.
nice to meet you. - And this is David, my husband.
Oh, David Senior. That's nice.
you're not Jews, obviously.
Oh, well l mean not that that's a good or a bad thing.
that they don't just name their children after-- okay, that was horrible.
um... these are Hadley's sisters,
Emily, Andrea and Popeye.
Hi, girls. - Hi.
could we order you a drink before lunch?
Oh, l'm set for now. Thank you.
um, l'll have the same.
Mmn. Mn!
so, l understand we have something to celebrate? Some good news, huh?
Oh, we're very excited, Terry.
we are crazy about Hadley. We really are.
l knew from the minute l met her. l did.
you did not. - l did.
no, mother, you didn't.
lf she said she did, she probably did!
well, l was taken for a surprise, - but-- but a happy one. - Yeah, well, you and me both.
should we toast? - Oh, yes. Let's do.
well-- to David and Hadley.
david and Hadley-- - Oh wait, wait, wait.
my glass is-- this is bad luck. Uh, waiter?
mother, it's okay. Here.
Oh.
Oh, just... a little more.
just
thank you.
so, shall we toast?
may l? - Please, do.
to David and Hadley.
a long and beautiful partnership.
Aw. - Thanks.
the-- mostly right now
l'm sorry, David, this is very emotional for me.
to my baby.
my first born, my little Hadley-wadley.
Aw.
that's what we called her. Hadley-wadley.
she was so loved from the minute she was born.
just an adorable little thing.
she was-- well, she grew up too fast didn't she?
she grew up so fast and had a mouth on her.
mother!
when she was in her teens she was her own little boss.
mother!
and she would sometimes just not come home
all right, could we just toast, please? Thank you.
okay, baby. We'll toast.
you have to forgive me. Um...
you all had a chance to process this, and l'm just coming on board, so to speak.
to Hadley-wadley.
MN.
Oh.
Oh!
Oh, no, no. l'm done toasting.
l'm just ordering another drink.
lt was horrible. - Maybe it wasn't.
maybe it wasn't as bad as you thought.
no, it was horrible.
lt was. l made an ass of myself. l was like...
a public service film against drinking.
just
Yeah, l was an old lush.
poor Hadley.
l feel so bad for her, Denny.
why are we going out here?
l hate the way l come off to my girls.
l just hate that l can't control my emotions.
Oh God.
this is creepy.
this was all a farm owned by the...
Firestone family until the 50's.
this and the whole subdivision.
lt goes on a bit about another eight acres.
why are we out here today?
l wanna do it.
out here? - No.
don't be an asshole.
l wanna sell my part of it.
just let your friends develop the lots and tell them "Yes."
tell them l don't need the money, though.
lf they think l need the money, they'll play games with me.
do you? - No.
Yes. No. l don't know.
l'm in some trouble...
unless l officially divorce the shitbox which l refuse to do, until at least he has the balls to show his face.
l wanna give the girls the money.
just tell your friend Shep l want to make the deal.
what?
nothing.
good. l'm going in.
this place is a clearinghouse for Lime disease.
Hey, this is cute. - Shep...
how are you, pal? - l'm doing great.
l'm hanging with Andy, how could l not be?
Hello, Terry.
Hadley's boyfriend.
okay, okay.
we're gonna go watch a movie. - lsn't that sweet?
'the Bicycle Thief. " She's never seen " The Bicycle Thief. "
he's a nut for foreign cinema.
anyone wanna join us?
snuggle up on the couch? Watch a classic?
l think we'll, uh, probably pass.
ls it the subtitles?
you know me too well.
l do and it's a burden.
l know him too well... - Okay.
so it's a burden. That's it.
okay.
l cannot tell you how much this thing disgusts me.
Oh, come on. She's doing great at work.
Shep's got her producing morning drive-time, plus... l think he really likes her.
Oh, the whole thing just infuriates me.
that's probably half the attraction.
what?
you know what. Not another word.
the deep hatred that men have felt for one another through the ages has blossomed into one chapter after another of repression, violence, hate, rape, religious slang and genocide.
l'm still working on it.
l need to fix the music.
lt's my final in television production.
you're really handsome, Gorden.
Thanks.
l should go.
l really do have to go.
the power of stress and naked anger is seen over and over again in the relationships that exist between the male and the female of our species.
here, in rural Botswana, an unfaithful tribeswoman is brought to a field by a group of locals for a ritualized punishment of beating and harassment.
events quickly spiral out of control for the tribesmen, though as the woman's fury becomes too great to contain and the men are quickly forced to flee for their safety.
why am l not excited by it?
um, because l don't think any of these new age arts colleges are really colleges.
of course, it's a college. What are you talking about?
honey, l've been there. l have.
l wanted to be a poet, remember?
just take arts courses at Ann Arbor.
l don't want to go to school in Ann Arbor.
no, of course you don't. lt's what l want you to do. Why would you?
okay, four years learning dance theory?
l have a theory about that.
lt's not going to happen.
how's the show? You enjoying it?
l wish you would take me seriously.
honey, l take you seriously.
l just don't think you have much capacity for self-evaluation.
you know, you'd think you'd be happy for me...
considering the way your life turned out.
the way your parents pushed you-- - To marry your father?
Yeah. - l'm not complaining.
they pushed me to take life seriously...
not to live in the clouds.
do you have any idea what a fucking idiot you sound like sometimes?
l love how you worry that the letter you sent to the parent who deserted you is too mean, and yet, to the one who's here in the fight, you have no problem saying the most vile things.
lsn't that a tad odd?
please finish setting the table.
fuck you!
Shep, wake up. Wake up, wake up.
Hey. - Oh, it's 5: 00.
okay, 5: 00. Just
no, my mother is downstairs and we need to get up.
we need to get up right-- Ah, hello!
okay, not now. We need to get
no, we need to get up. - And
"red eye Stinger." Tony Guerra.
he was pretty drunk, that guy. - No, not him.
try earlier.
I only done one other stinger this year.
do you remember anything about him? The other one.
another Mexican. I think. I get so many bean-eaters in here.
I was probably just glad it wasn't her again.
I could do that tat with my eyes closed.
so, is this like a cop thing?
I imagine they'll get around to you pretty soon.
there he is. Lazaro Huerta.
and the caterer will be here very, very early.
I get up with the sun. How's my...
how's the candidate holding up?
give it to me straight.
he doesn't have your head for policy.
I'd like to see him plowing his way through the appropriations bill.
he's never been much of a reader.
well, we break it down and feed it to him bite-sized.
he's impatient. He's always been impatient.
he's knuckling down. You have every reason to be proud of him.
publicly...
he's a fucking disaster when he's off the script.
I don't think we have to worry so much about him straying that far.
I mean, as long as nothing comes flying in from left field.
and what would that be?
in Carbonville...
right next to Everything For A Buck store.
I've looked up 18 Huertas in the phone book.
I've called them all.
shit!
I seem to be missing a microwave oven.
if anything else comes up, I'll make sure to get back to you, Sheriff.
okay.
she takes the broom, leaves the dustpan.
story of my life.
Hello?
Yes, hi, it's... - Danny?
Yeah. It was great to see you the other day.
you looked really good, Danny.
Hey, if this is about me and Chandler...
no, no. This is business.
I'm doing a little background on the Pilager family...
and since you're covering the...
I'm actually going to a function at the senator's house tomorrow...
a thank-you for their big fund-raisers.
if you promise to be on your best behavior...
that would be great. Chandler won't mind, will he?
it's a fund-raising thing. Why would he mind?
Nora, I've been thinking a lot about you lately.
even before Debbie left, l...
Danny, stop.
it's too late, all right?
it's really sweet of you, but we've both moved on, haven't we?
Yeah. Right.
we're yesterday's news.
sorry to bother you at this hour.
good night.
good night, Danny.
richard Pilager cares about the family.
so, what did you see in him?
he was intense.
you know, he cared about things.
Oh, my God. He used to...
he used to write on the walls.
like graffiti? - In the house.
he'd be working on a story, and he'd get so wrapped up in it...
that he'd like, get a Magic Marker...
and write all the names and important facts all over the living room wall...
and then he'd try to connect the dots.
so you had to live with it.
the landlord wasn't thrilled about it...
but Danny always painted over it.
you know, he thought...
this was when we were still at the Monitor, when it was still political.
he thought that journalists should change things...
you know, not just report.
he wanted to be the referee and not just the scorekeeper.
I guess.
when I was a press liaison for Fred Loomis...
we had a slogan on the wall.
it said, "You don't tell us how to stage the news...
and we won't tell you how to report it.
terrific.
power is a locomotive, babe.
you either hop on board, or it runs right over you.
sounds like he laid down on the tracks.
see ya.
dinner at La Fonda? - Yeah.
he was the love of my life.
it rains like the dickens in these mountains...
but you won't see any streams running down them.
so where does the water go?
what you're looking at is honeycombed with hundreds...
maybe thousands of mine shafts.
when you stop pumping the water out...
over time those holes fill up top to bottom...
till there's nowhere else for it to go.
a huge pressure builds up looking for an outlet.
in 1943...
four miners broke a pick hole...
in a wall to an adjacent area...
that hadn't been worked in 20 years.
water exploded out of that wall...
drove those four fellas and their equipment back through the shaft they'd dug, out into the main tunnel...
that Newhouse had built to service the mine blasted through an opening...
and blew the water clear across the river to the other side.
for three days, water blasted out of that mountain...
timber, tracks, loose rocks, half-ton ore cars...
flying through the air like they were toys.
you know, we think we can wound this planet.
we think we can cut costs and stick the money in our pockets...
and just walk away with it.
but someday the bill comes due.
this ore you're looking at assays out at about an ounce and a half a ton...
which can be worth your while depending on how much it costs you to get it out of the ground...
you gotta knock it down with dynamite...
throw it on one of those carts up there...
and then upstairs, run it through all the crushers...
and chemicals separate out the valuable stuff from the tailings.
Yeah. Now, if you want to move up ahead to under that stope...
and look off to the left...
you'll see what every miner was hoping for a vein of almost pure yellow stuff.
you can all fit in. I'll join you in a minute.
so you were a miner?
mining engineer...
until I went to work for the feds.
got interested in how to do the job...
better and safer.
that was under Carter. He put some teeth in the rules.
what's your beef with Dickie Pilager?
you're not here just for the tour, are you?
I have to inform you you're being watched.
is that so?
there was an incident on the campaign trail the other day...
and your name came up as a potential...
perpetrator? - Something like that.
it's the old man whose guts I hate.
the senator. - Him and his pal Benteen.
take a good look, Dickie.
what do you see?
mountains?
I see a big sign that says, "No Americans allowed."
you do?
you look at a map, they got half the West under lock and key.
they?
bureau of Land Management, Forest Service...
national parks, the State.
right. Right.
it's like a treasure chest waiting to be opened...
only there's a 500-pound bureaucrat sitting on it.
I'm a small government man.
that's why we chose you, son.
of course, the people...
the people gotta be grabbed by the horns and dragged to what's good for them.
the people. You remember the shale oil?
over in Parachute.
the big oil companies say they were gonna squeeze oil out of rock.
the people come flocking like a damn herd of sheep.
thought they were all gonna get rich quick...
like with every other mineral strike in the history of this state.
but who's left holding the shiny stuff after all the dust clears?
who?
the folks that see the big picture. - Right.
that's me and you, son.
we're looking at it right now, all around us.
right.
couple of weeks, I'm gonna have to call you Governor.
you know what the big picture is, don't you, Dickie?
it's...
privatization.
the land was meant for the citizens...
not them damn pencil pushers in Washington.
like this Silver City deal?
just a pile of mine debris I'm trying to unload.
son, we got resources here you wouldn't believe.
untapped resources.
you and your dad are the point men in the fight to liberate those resources for the American people.
aspen, Vail.
that ain't shit compared to what I could build...
if they opened this up to somebody with some ideas with some know-how.
I understand.
and the people won't get it done...
not by a long sight.
they get distracted worrying about some postcard idea of the Rockies...
some black-footed ferret or endangered tumbleweed.
but if a man of vision were to come along...
I can see it.
how's that saddle feeling?
it's coming along.
we'll make a cowboy out of you yet.
we'd done so well with that one...
I took on the second biggest hazard in the state...
the Silver City mining operation.
owned by Dickie Pilager.
he owned the land, but Benteen was leasing the mineral rights.
they go hand in glove, you know...
the Benteens and the Pilagers.
they were still digging. - They had acres and acres of tailings...
piled up from the Silver City glory days.
looked like a pile of trash rock...
but if you could process it on a large enough scale...
I'm talking about bulldozers the size of battleships...
you could make a fortune.
providing jobs for the economically depressed.
a few, sure.
but then we started getting nasty pH readings...
from the watershed all around them.
started getting fish die-off...
heavy metal residue.
the company said it was from the old mine shafts in these mountains around them.
there was nothing they could do about it.
not true?
they were concentrating the gold in these huge leach piles...
and then dumping cyanide solution on them.
they used cyanide? - Sodium cyanide.
it's a lixiviate.
basic chemistry.
smells like apricots for miles around.
I had an informant inside.
or I thought I did.
Esparza... that was his name.
Vincent Esparza.
he told me they were pushing all the contaminants to one side.
no treatment, no containment.
just leaving it out there for the elements.
and that was what's getting into our water system.
he even helped me plan my surprise inspection.
but when I got there...
nothing but a bunch of empty pits...
and a workforce with their lips buttoned.
I felt like an idiot.
I'd brought the press, photographers.
and your inside man, Esparza?
gone with the wind. They said he'd been fired months earlier.
you got sandbagged.
Benteen, he doesn't take any prisoners.
he had his friend, Senator Pilager...
appoint a new man at the top...
whose only mission was to castrate the agency.
and who do you think got fired first?
then they started allegations of misuse of funds.
there were even public hints about a drinking problem.
and when I tried to go back to work as a mining engineer...
I found out soon enough I was all but unhireable in the industry.
Yeah.
and then I figured, well...
since they accused me of having a drinking problem...
I just might as well develop one.
and even with all that, you still wouldn't...
they don't have to worry about me, the Pilagers.
I know when I'm licked.
if there's one thing I know all of you good folks have in common...
it's that you know a good investment when you see one.
a big part of our agenda is up and rolling on a federal level...
but it's high time we had somebody running this state...
who's a hundred percent behind the program.
hear! Hear!
this has required a great commitment of time and finances...
from each and every one of you.
and despite the attack on our rights by Proposition 27...
you folks went out and you shook the money tree like never before.
so I'm here to present our next governor...
a young man who...
well, who's almost as good-looking as his father.
richard Pilager!
I know none of you came here to listen to another speech.
but I'd just like to say how much I appreciate...
your support in this... effort we've got going to bring sober, responsive government back to this great state.
and you might as well pledge some money to my daddy's next campaign while you're here.
thank you.
so, Mr. Benteen.
how's it look for the Prospectors this year?
you a fan? - Sure.
Why?
they're fun to watch.
more fun when they win than when they lose.
sure. - Nothing to be ashamed of.
it's basic human behavior.
you can always pull for the underdog.
americans don't have the patience for underdogs they used to.
they don't?
a coach goes three seasons without a ring, he's out on his ass...
as he should be.
hendrickson has been off for how long now?
hendrickson isn't coming back.
people want to back a winner.
they need to feel a part of something bigger than they are.
they used to advertise the quality of a product...
tastes great, whitens your teeth...
shaves close, rides like a dream.
now what do they push?
america's number one soft drink.
best-selling mid-sized utility vehicle.
it isn't "buy the product." It's "join the club."
you make people feel part of a winner, they'll follow you anywhere.
you a winner, son?
I like to think so.
good boy.
you know, Dickie is not really a fine print kind of guy.
he's more intuitive.
my people have whittled the regs down pretty much to where we want them to be.
it's fairly simple stuff.
environmental Heritage Initiative.
Yeah, we thought it sounded better than "Developers' Bill Of Rights."
you breathe the word "deregulation," certain parties get a little uppity.
what is he doing here? - You know him?
his agency is looking into something for us.
Really? Good luck.
what does that mean?
he used to be a reporter. O'Brien.
till he screwed the pooch and bankrupted his paper.
grace Seymour hired him on the rebound.
and when was all this?
I'm surprised you could find me. You must be some kind of detective.
so this Lazaro could have worked in a kitchen?
they bus them up from Carbonville every day.
resort towns run on frijole power, man.
the richer the Anglos are...
the more of mis hermanos del sur they got working for them.
your restaurant caters too? - I'm moonlighting, man.
they're doing a big renovation. I got two weeks off starting tomorrow.
I figured I go up to Black Hawk...
hit the casinos before my ex-wife gets ahold of my paycheck.
how would you like to work for me?
you know who most of the labor contractors are.
what's it pay?
whatever you make a day at the restaurant, plus 20.
private eye, huh? - Looks good on the resume.
I'm thinking about the chicks, man.
in the movies, those cabrones make out like crazy.
you speak the language. You know how to get around.
so what happened to this Lazaro Huerta that he's not breathing no more?
multiple fractures, busted skull, punctured lung.
still want the job?
Thanks. Why did she dump you?
Debbie? - Yeah.
maybe she figured out I was always gonna treat her like the consolation prize.
I mean, after you, I kind of retired, emotionally.
we were... I don't know.
incompatible?
we had our issues.
she seemed way too structured for someone like you.
why did you dump me?
you were so down on yourself...
so convinced that you were a loser...
that I started to agree with you.
I was a loser. - You lost a job.
you were moving up, and I was moving down.
and I didn't quit the paper when you were fired. That wasn't loyal.
I deserved to be fired. - You were set up.
and I was ambitious.
so, are you marrying this guy?
seems like the mature thing to do, yeah.
that sounds exciting. - Come on, Danny.
it's not earth-shaking between us, but...
romance is for kids.
we like to ski. We like to travel.
he's a corporate mouthpiece.
and I'm a part of the entertainment business.
what else do you think is out there?
look, I hope you're happy with it.
no, you don't.
come on up. There's somebody here I'd like you to meet.
stay in touch. Okay? - Yeah.
I've never been so close before.
I know how much this means to you.
the county commission went off walking on air...
when Chuck Raven brought Dickie Pilager to the table.
that was a nice thing for him to do.
nice? I'm paying Chandler Tyson a fortune for that kind of access.
a fortune? - A slice of the pie.
but they were starstruck, Gracie.
the zoning's in the bag.
these people will bend over backwards.
you have worked so hard.
if we were a little bit more liquid...
I'd sink every dime we have into this thing.
like you did that time with the stock market?
hell, it's more than the money.
I'm building a city, Grace.
a city.
we run something on the Web site...
information we've got... we connect the dots...
and the guilty party, they pretend to ignore it.
if they sue us, certain documents could be entered in a court of law...
where if you deny things it's perjury.
you gotta have the documents.
it's amazing what things are blowing under my door and end up on my desk.
so, you plant the seed.
and the mainstream guys, the print journalists...
they bring it to their editors and their editors say...
cool your jets. This is too far out. We don't have the resources.
we don't have the balls to go after this kind of thing.
but track the story...
and if it ever breaks...
you gotta have the balls.
so we keep accumulating the facts...
till the story is screaming out so loud it's impossible to ignore.
and they run a little test item on page six...
saying allegations have been made.
allegations?
it's beneath their dignity to quote some cellar-dweller Web site in their hallowed journal.
but the bastards in power have to publicly deny those allegations...
and then they're fair game.
first it's the columnists taking potshots.
then when they've got the politicians on the run...
they use our legwork, our ideas to write outraged exposes and win Pulitzers.
then they gang up like a pack of jackals.
but somebody has to plant the seed.
the seed of doubt.
he seems a lot more gubernatorial with the sound off.
for a day is coming, my friends...
a great day and a terrible day...
a day when the skies shall open and the waters shall part...
and the dead shall rise up and walk upon the Earth.
and the wicked and the righteous shall bejudged alike.
but that day cannot come...
unless the children of Israel are within the holy land...
for so it has been prophesied in the great Book of Revelations.
so let us look at a map of the Middle East.
let us look at the headlines of today...
and see what conclusions we can draw from the evidence.
many are the portents and the signs.
but we need to discern a pattern.
we need to connect one event with the other...
and it will be clear that there are no accidents...
that there is a greater force at work...
and it holds the plan for Armageddon.
richard Pilager cares about the American worker.
you work with the same bunch all the time?
Yeah, more or less. As far as I know, they're all citizens.
I wasn't asking that.
Mojados are a bit cheaper, but they're not worth the hassle.
need some hard huevos to keep them in line.
not that I got anything against them.
I wouldn't go that far.
but you should check into the packing houses across town.
they got a lot of them in there making chorizo.
any of your own guys been missing the last few days?
you're looking for this Lazaro, right?
cops were here this morning asking the same thing.
I'm not a cop. - No shit.
but it's like I told him. I got no Lazaros here.
who brings them up...
here in Timberline County?
you heard of Vince Esparza? - Yeah, I've heard the name.
he's the Saddam-fucking-Hussein of labor contractors.
they pay the coyote half up front to get them across the border...
and when they're delivered here they owe Esparza the rest.
so they start in the hole. - And they stay in it.
he keeps them moving around the country...
keeps them isolated, keeps them scared.
where can I find him?
you do not want to fuck with Vicente Esparza, my friend.
I hired a few of his boys without knowing it once.
they'd run off or try to make their way back home.
next thing I know, I got a shotgun stuck in my face.
what's up?
Daniel O'Brien. I called earlier.
she's back in the rink.
just keep heading straight through. - Thanks.
I wanna play that last one back.
nice shot.
training for the Olympics?
actually, I am.
the only sport I'm not already too old for.
no, thanks.
helps me with the Zen aspect of the thing.
eventually the arrow should become one with the bull's-eye and release itself.
then I'll just be like a channel.
so, you from Home and Garden or what? - I'm working for Chuck Raven.
go on.
you're, like, really accurate with that, right?
it depends on how much dope I've smoked.
how much have you smoked? - I've lost track.
there was an incident on the campaign trail...
that was potentially embarrassing to your brother.
what, he made a speech without a teleprompter?
there was a dead body involved.
anyone I know?
Lazaro Huerta?
can't place him.
maybe just another skeleton out of Daddy's closet.
you sure you don't want a hit?
you look a little tense. - No. It makes me paranoid.
like someone's got you in their crosshairs?
Yeah. Something like that.
how about a drink then? A bottle of tequila by your left leg.
you're not gonna, like, shoot it out of my hand or anything?
relax.
so you're some kind of a campaign lackey?
investigator. - Am I being investigated?
Mr. Raven thinks you may be harboring a grudge.
my whole life is a fucking grudge.
investigator.
you go to some kind of school for that?
no, I was working as a reporter.
I hate reporters. - Well, I'm not one anymore.
fifteen years old, I'm pregnant...
the fucking Mountain Monitor outs me.
senator's Daughter In College Sex Scandal.
it was before my time.
the whole thing was set up.
fly to Nevada, nice, quiet operation, back to school within a week.
you could still have had a... - Public abortion?
with the Christian crusaders block-voting for my father?
so he advised you not to.
I was a hopeful. - A hopeful?
Yeah. Olympic hopeful.
figure skating.
nine months carrying DeweyJunior...
another four to recover.
my body wasn't the same.
your center of gravity changes...
and you can't do the jumps.
that's what happened to Tonya Harding, you know.
it wasn't Nancy Kerrigan. It was her center of gravity.
you mature, your perception changes...
and you never get it back.
what's your name?
you're cute.
Thanks.
if I'm being investigated, I could do worse.
excuse me.
and who wants to know?
you gotta be him.
how you figure on that?
it's the shoes, ese. Braceros don't be wearing their party boots on the job.
Vince Esparza. Man, you a legend.
people say you got crews working all over the county.
people say a lot of shit that isn't necessarily true.
I'm looking for a guy named Lazaro Huerta.
I don't keep track of their names.
I'm not runnin' a summer camp here.
would you mind if I was to ask your jornaleros a few questions?
Yeah, I would mind. They're here to work.
they wanna blow their nose, scratch their balls, talk about their girlfriends...
they can do it on their own time.
this is a job here. This is private property.
and if someone who is not authorized to be here was to get hurt...
it'd be my responsibility.
they're hiding something.
my first husband was a downhill racer.
won the bronze at Innsbruck.
Wow.
he ditched me in, what, '85.
my girlfriend just moved out.
you poor baby.
took my couch.
you can have this one if you want.
she picked it out. It was both of ours.
she paid for half of it.
Rodney? They called him Hot Rod.
won the bronze?
he runs a lodge in Aspen he got as a settlement.
he sued you for alimony?
daddy paid him off so he wouldn't file adultery charges.
anything to avoid another public scandal.
you were adultering?
Yeah. But so was he.
but he was the one who hired some fucking investigator to take pictures.
we don't do much of that these days... divorce stuff.
transom peeping? - Nobody has transoms anymore.
but you still peep.
well, mostly it's on, you know, computer records.
we have ways to access. We share information, buy lists...
your credit balance, where you travel, what videos you rent.
Wow.
that's invasion of privacy.
so the skier ditched you.
then I tried living in California for a while...
but there was nobody there to embarrass but myself.
so you are trying to embarrass him. - It's pointless.
what could I do they haven't seen worse on some reality show?
you're a senator's daughter...
sister to the future governor.
they catch one president getting a BJ in the Oval Office.
the next rigs the election, gets away with it.
people have lost the ability to be scandalized.
so now your ambition is?
make sure my son gets out of his 20s in one piece.
represent my country in 2004.
you're that good at it, huh?
you know...
the Amazon women amputated one of their breasts.
it got in the way of the bow string.
give me three of those lottery tickets.
I'm feeling kinda lucky all of the sudden.
somebody's fucking with me.
these were bad guys.
they owned a whole bunch of low-rent housing downtown.
the building boom had started, and they had a big offer to sell...
but they couldn't legally evict their tenants.
so they were doing strong-arm stuff, intimidating.
there was even some arson involved. - The march of progress.
the housing inspector who should have been on top of this... Skaggs was taking payoffs.
I had these two informants... very Deep Throat.
meetings in parking garages, the whole deal.
and they give me the big lead.
now, this is criminal activity that they're exposing.
so I write the story. My editor, Mitch, he trusts me enough to run with it.
and they're willing to testify in court?
they said yeah, if it came to it. But I didn't have them on tape.
the landlord and the inspector sue the paper...
one of my sources blows town and the other flat denies it.
big retraction, settlement out of court...
and I'm seriously fired.
worse, I'm the guy who fabricates.
Cayahuari Yacu, the jungle lndians call this country, "the land where God did not finish Creation.
they believe only after man has disappeared will He return to finish His work.
for God's sake. . .
if we're gonna do this. . .
if we're gonna do this. . .
. . . Iet's do it in style.
we're going to miss Caruso if you don't put some fire under it.
Oh, you've wiped oil all over your face.
isn't that better?
Oh, Molly, please.
come on, for God's sake!
champagne for the horses! The best!
we're gonna make it.
sir, Madam. This is a gala performance.
we come from lquitos, one thousand two hundred miles down the Amazon.
I had to row because our motor broke down.
look at his hands.
for two days and two nights I've been rowing to see Caruso once in my life.
you have no tickets.
this man needs to go in there. He has no ticket but he has a right.
sir, Madam, you can't go in there.
I'm going to build an opera house in lquitos and Caruso'll open it.
it'll be the greatest opera of the jungle. Please, let us in.
you'll work with us. Let us in, please.
I'd like to be in there myself, believe me. . .
follow me!
make sure to be quiet and press yourselves right up against the wall.
he pointed to you.
he pointed to me. You see him. . . he means me.
Fitzcarraldo? How do you spell it?
what an interesting name!
my father was lrish. My real name is Fitzgerald.
Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald.
they had trouble saying it in Peru.
Fitzgerald? lquitos? You're not the man with the railway are you?
Yeah, that's me.
well. . . the Trans-Andean Railway, but. . .
. . . the project fell through.
but the idea was a bold one.
at the moment I'm trying my luck as as ice producer, to make money.
here, all people want. . .
. . . for their money are the big names from Europe.
Sarah Bernhardt, an actress who can't even sing.
but her wooden leg is the talk of the town.
the ice, ah, I mean. . .
I'm doing all this because I have one dream. . .
. . . the opera.
the Great Opera in the Jungle!
Fitzcarraldo will build it and Caruso will sing at the premiere.
it's only the dreamers who ever move mountains.
for five years now we've been the richest town in the whole world.
it's like gold fever.
may I show you the house?
when this opera was built there were only a few huts here.
the building was practically in the jungle.
prices are ten times higher here than in New York.
there are palaces being built with tiles from Delft and Florentine marble.
and lquitos is catching up. It's still a filthy frontier town. . .
. . . but the rubber business is growing by leaps and bounds.
the better-off citizens in Manaus, if I may put it like that. . .
. . . send their laundry to Lisbon. . .
. . . because the water in the Amazon is felt to be impure.
aren't you going to stay?
I don't know.
I don't mind you're running a brothel.
but there are too many of your clients around.
come on. I train the girls for the best households.
much better than sending them out on the streets.
I've nothing against the girls, Molly.
I just can't stand the sight of dandies who think money can buy everything.
and the opera. . . I've got to work on this ice production.
you could take a crack at respectability, you know. Wouldn't kill you.
respectability just made me bankrupt.
I'm better off down there by the river.
got my real audience down there now. . .
the kids?
Yeah, that's my public. And a pig.
one of those lean racing pigs loves me.
how could she help it.
when I build my opera house. . .
. . . I'll see to it you have your own box and a red velvet armchair.
it works through a chemical reaction of two different salts.
just imagine the possibilities ice has, but people don't see it.
the children love it.
Yeah, they eat it.
imagine, one day. . .
. . . ice in every warehouse, on every ship.
Yes, make your bet.
what do you think of it?
I'll tell you what I think. You can read up about ice in any school book.
it's out of the question to apply for a patent.
but I have the experience, and it's experience that counts.
what good is ice here? To cool the rubber?
maybe we should magically create some glaciers in the jungle.
and then we'll build the Trans-Andean Railroad on sled skids. . .
. . . ioosen the brakes, give her a push. . .
. . . and adios! Off she goes, sledding down into the valley?
come on, come on.
don't take it to heart.
here, this is for you.
use this, play a hand with us.
the precious feeling of losing money!
nothing like it! Ecstasy!
the church remains closed 'til this town has its opera house.
I want the opera house!
I want my opera house!
I want to have an opera!
this church remains closed 'til this town has an opera!
I will build my opera!
I want to have my opera.
I could have let you cool your heels in there for two weeks.
Thanks. Two days were more than enough.
I'm sure Molly is behind this.
you're mistaken. But come with me.
I'll show you the real reason I'm letting you out so soon.
they won't budge. I felt moved. Even a horse would be touched.
that shouldn't be too hard to arrange.
all of them together, at the same time?
don Aquilino, The Borja brothers. . .
I have my ways. Don't worry. I'll bring all my girls with me.
we'll have all the rubber barons gathered together like flies.
and I guarantee you, they'll be feeling good.
I'll bring my phonograph.
you need some sprucing up first.
I'm not letting you out of my house like that.
a steam bath for Mr. Fitzcarraldo! Full treatment.
and then deliver him to my bedroom.
this is serious. . . help. . . hey Molly, tell them. . . help!
everyone wants money from me. The hospital, the fire brigade. . .
. . . and now you keep talking my ear off about your opera.
it gives expression to our deepest feelings.
what is he talking about?
our deepest feelings!
just take a look at this.
come a bit closer.
take a good look.
a little demonstration.
1 000 dollar bills seem to taste best.
see how fast our money goes down the drain?
you must have experienced this.
a railway is sure to swallow up a lot of money.
how thrilling it must be to go bankrupt.
let's return to our friends.
Yes, such a chance to meet all one's friends and rivals in one place. . .
. . . does not present itself very often.
rosita, over there!
take the champagne over there!
please, may we have your attention?
please, come a bit closer.
servant! Hold him!
he can't get away with this.
one moment! Please, please, please!
ladies and gentlemen, don't worry.
this man is harmless, he's just had a soul-stirring experience.
my servants will escort you to the kitchen.
my dogs' cook will prepare you a meal.
thank you very much, sir, you were superb.
to your dogs' cook.
to Verdi.
to Rossini.
to Caruso.
to Fitzcarraldo, the Conquistador of the Useless!
Cheers!
as true as I am standing here, one day I shall bring grand opera to lquitos.
I will outnumber you.
I will outbillion you.
I am the spectacle in the forest.
I am the inventor of rubber.
I will outrubber you.
sir, the reality of your world is nothing more. . .
. . . than a rotten caricature of great opera.
Fitz, Fitz, let's go.
he's as dead as a doornail. He is no opponent for you.
madam, I'm still standing firm on both my legs.
you're a big game hunter, aren't you?
what's that got to do with it?
then you should know: When you shoot an elephant. . .
. . . he sometimes stays on his legs for ten days before he topples over.
come on, girls, we're leaving. This way!
rubber. That's the way to do it. Forget about the ice.
you need a big steam-boat. And most of all you need land.
and hundreds of workers.
the rubber barons have divided up the land. But there's still some left.
how do you know?
through Don Aquilino. Why don't you pay him a visit?
forget about it.
why don't you try him out?
my territory begins right here where the Pongo ends. . .
. . . and reaches downstream for 80 miles.
and above the Pongo?
I'd like to have that myself.
we've thought about building a road across the mountains. . .
. . . but it would be an impossible venture, and there still wouldn't be. . .
a ship. . . and nobody has made it upstream?
want to see for yourself? We can go a little further by foot.
what's he saying?
we must be quiet.
he says, whoever talks. . .
. . . will be swallowed up by the evil spirits of the rapids.
the lndians call the rapids Chirimagua, "the angry spirits.
anyone who falls in there is lost.
the native bare-asses also say, "The water has no hair to hold on to.
is this a rubber tree?
right. Hevea brasiliensis.
they call the rubber tree caoutchou. . .
. . ."the tree that weeps.
these bare-asses love flowery language.
gold, they call "sweat of the sun.
bees, "father of honey.
you know, it's no easy job to civilize them, believe me.
how much do you think this stinky stuff weighs?
1 32 pounds! And I presume you're familiar with the market price.
how long does it take to make one of them?
three men one week.
presently I have a staff of 8, 500.
but I am thinking of increasing to 1 0, 000.
you're a strange bird, but I must say I like you.
that's my area. From the Pongo to the mouth of the Ucayali.
up there you see the Peruvian Amazon Company, a joint stock company. . .
. . . and there, the Borja brothers.
what does that square mean?
that's the rubber region of the Ucayali, about 1 4 million trees.
it's the only area still unclaimed.
because of the rapids of the Pongo das Mortes. . .
. . . you'd have to have wings to fly into this area.
what about up on the Pachitea?
no rubber trees, maybe a few, but not enough to make it worthwhile.
the only thing you'll find there are savage lndians.
no gold, no rubber, no nothing.
only head hunters. . .
the two rivers almost touch each other.
what?
how exact is this map? ls there anything more precise?
Oh, it's a pretty good map.
in 1 896 a group of surveyors and soldiers got to the Upper Pachitea. . .
. . . but most of them were murdered.
then some missionaries got as far as Saramiriza, their farthest settlement.
from there on you'll find only savage Jivaros and Campas.
two padres ended up as shrunken heads.
have you ever seen a shrunken head?
Yes. . . I mean. . .
no. . . sort of. . .
have you made your choice?
I can't decide -- I guess I'll take both.
Molly, listen! - What is it?
I need your money, every red cent you can spare.
Oh Fitz, not again. . . - I have an idea.
an amazing idea!
here, look at this.
I've bought some maps, I can explain everything to you.
first I have to contact a lawyer, then get a ship.
but my money is not gonna buy you a ship, Fitz.
you're squeezing me to death!
I can't breathe.
the document, please. Thank you.
the act of territorial acquisition is done step by step.
you and your partner sign, you pay the money. . .
. . . and I will complete the document with my signature.
before you sign, I'd like to direct your attention to the option clause.
what option clause?
through its executive organs, the Peruvian government is insistent. . .
. . . with no exceptions, that a region of this size be taken into possession. . .
. . . by deed and by proof within nine months.
you will have to prove that real operational steps. . .
. . . have been taken to exploit the region.
otherwise your right of exploitation will be terminated.
the point is that the state is concerned that areas such as this. . .
. . . are productively used by competent men of business. . .
. . . so that they
come on, we are wasting time.
may I ask you a question of a personal nature?
do you really know what you're doing?
we're gonna do what nobody's ever done.
we're going to be very, very rich.
well?
please, sir, sign on the dotted line.
that's it.
that's it.
isn't it marvelous?
we should be able to fix it up.
it's wonderful.
you haven't seen the whole thing.
I like it already.
watch out here.
everything's rotted.
the engine room.
up the stairs.
wait a moment.
wait. Let me go first.
to our contract! Please come in, gentlemen.
now that the purchase of my ship is settled, let me be quite frank.
you bet.
I forced you to take Cholo as mechanic or you wouldn't have gotten the ship.
I realize that.
very good. Good.
he's a first-rate mechanic, I'll tell you that much.
now, what else is he?
the reason behind it all, excuse my bluntness. . .
. . . is that I wish to be kept informed about the activities of my competitors.
I don't want my territory contested.
don't worry.
every steamship owner is a potential enemy. . .
. . . but those with just a canoe can't hurt us.
the two of us have a bet going. . .
. . . how long it will take until you go bankrupt.
Oh, don't take it personally, please.
we're all sportsmen, aren't we?
no, only one of us.
I shall move a mountain.
when is she gonna be ready?
tomorrow. For days he's been telling me tomorrow.
I hope she'll be ready for launching.
I wonder what this character's really up to.
what's your name?
paul Resenbrink. I'm Dutch.
they call me Orinoco Paul. . .
. . . because I know every goddamn bend in this river.
you haven't sailed for some time.
that's right. My last ship was the Adolfo.
my eyesight isn't so good, but I cannot be fooled.
what do you mean?
the jungle plays tricks on your senses.
it's full of lies, demons, illusions.
I have learned to tell the difference between reality and hallucinations.
I see that you took part in the Pachitea expedition in 1 886.
Yes, as helmsman.
on the return trip I was the captain.
the captain died. There were only five survivors.
paul Resenbrink, you have captain's authority.
help me choose the crew.
we need strong, fearless men.
I'm afraid we'll find few good men here.
first of all we need a pilot.
does anyone have experience as a pilot?
scram, you puny runt! I'm Huerequeque.
brethren! I am Huerequeque!
I am the best cook in all of el Amazonas.
I have been on every ship.
and amigo, I'm not stupid. I know what your plans are.
huerequeque may tip the bottle now and then. . .
. . . but up here. . . electric, electrico!
also, I am the best gunman on the entire Amazon.
what do you think of him? - Upstream and downstream.
is he really a good gunman? - I would have to say, yes.
what was your name? Huere. . .
Huerequeque.
Huerequeque, you are our cook.
Cheers, then.
please understand.
who bought the ship? Who paid for the crew?
it's my right to come with you.
Molly, you can't leave the girls. What are they gonna do without you?
and what will I do without you?
I'll be back.
Fitz. . . do you still love me?
we are partners, you and me.
Oh Fitz, you're crazy!
Oh Fitz, it's wonderful!
this is your day, Molly!
you've given the ship my name!
that's more than my poor heart can stand.
now comes the official part.
here. Throw it -- hard!
these are my assistants. I can't cook without them.
come on, kids, come on.
why isn't he going down to the Ucayali?
why is he heading upstream?
I thought he was going to the Pongo das Mortes.
you saw right.
Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald is going up the Amazon.
we're going upstream! What's the idea?
we're going up the river. That's the idea.
and, from now on, you only leave the engine room if I say so.
what do you think you're doing? Getting around my girls!
get lost!
don Fitzcarraldo! Don Fitzcarraldo!
you're back at last. I'd almost given up hope.
look here, Amazon Terminal ready for action.
I see you've become a father.
I knew you'd come back.
I thought you'd forgotten about me when the railroad construction ceased.
every year I repaint the first class booking office.
it looks a little weather-beaten. . .
. . . but wait until your trains cross the mountains from the Amazon. . .
. . . to the Pacific, then everything will change.
I've been here six years now, without payment.
therefore. . .
the engine is in good working order.
all the levers work, but. . .
but I must confess. . .
. . . I was forced to sell a few iron parts to the lndians.
they need it for their machetes and things.
they used to come at night to steal parts.
so I thought. . .
. . . it was better to sell than to have things stolen at night.
I had to do it. I was left alone and deserted on this post.
I thought you'd been sent home like everybody else.
let me show you outside.
the tracks reach 200 meters deep into the jungle.
come with me. I made an invention to scare off the lndians.
they've become more cautious. I do the same thing with the snakes.
I connect an electric line to the tracks.
the lndians get their fingers singed. They won't touch them again.
I chase the snakes onto the rails with a stick.
on the first rail they get fried, on the second they turn to ash.
every year, I cut back the bushes. . .
when will you resume construction?
the thing is. . . we've come here on a different project.
our whole financial situation will change overnight, if it works.
what I'm trying to say is. . .
. . . we need the tracks for another purpose.
no, not those from under the engine, not those. . .
don Fitzcarraldo.
the men are removing the tracks under the locomotive.
I'm begging you, leave me just a few yards to roll it back and forth.
Hey, leave those under there! There's more out in the forest.
thank you, thank you.
we should have reached the Pachitea a long time ago.
no, we haven't.
but according to the map. . .
I don't rely on maps.
how can you be so sure about that?
no river tastes like the Pachitea. It's just ahead of us.
isn't that something. . .
brimming over!
Oh, these women!
that's what I need.
what's going on here?
we're going up the Pachitea.
is that so?
where are we going?
amigos, welcome to the Pachitea!
known for it's native hospitality. . .
something is going on down below.
they don't seem to agree with our course.
what?
I told you in lquitos I needed men, not cowards who shit in their pants.
so. . .
whoever wants to leave, step forward.
welcome to Saramiriza!
Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald.
we thought you were a government commission.
welcome to our place, here.
welcome.
happy to have you.
I am Huerequeque. - Welcome.
thank you, thanks.
how can anyone learn patriotism from a school book?
the Government requires it.
the natives get used to it like vaccination.
the children already feel like Peruvians.
the other day I asked them. . .
. . ."Are you lndians?
no," they said, "not us, the ones up the river are.
then I asked, "What are lndians?
they said, "Indians are people. . .
. . . who can't read and who don't know how to wash their clothes.
and what do the older people say?
well.
we can't seem to cure them of the idea. . .
. . . that our everyday life is only an illusion. . .
. . . behind which lies the reality of dreams.
I am very interested in these ideas.
I specialize in opera myself.
what do you know about the Jivaros on the upper Pachitea?
I was there during the disaster in '96.
have you had any contact since then?
some years ago, two of our brothers set off with some natives.
one of them came back a few days later. . .
. . . and said the Jivaros had withdrawn deep into the forest.
the expedition vanished without a trace.
a few weeks later, one of our brothers was washed up.
they'd filled his stomach with heavy stones and his head was gone.
anyway, what do you want up there?
I'm planning something geographical.
Paul.
the crew.
quiet down, you drunken idiots! Stop it!
you have to crack down on the men, or you can find yourself a new captain.
who's causing trouble?
Evaristo Chavez and Fabiano, the Brazilian. And the two women.
they must go ashore immediately, they're the main ones.
and Huerequeque, he's smart but not to be trusted.
your services are no longer required. I give you two minutes to get ashore.
you'll see, we're the lucky ones.
and the women.
come on, move!
see to the rest!
and all of you, back to work. Go on!
reduce speed! Half speed ahead!
what are the men doing?
they've armed themselves.
under no circumstances are they to shoot.
that was our mistake on the first expedition.
go down and tell them that, or there'll be a disaster.
what the hell are you doing?
just trying to have a little conversation with our invisible friends.
idiot, this will cost us our lives. Yours first.
there are silences and silences.
and this one, I don't like at all.
there's something on the water.
where?
something black, floating towards us.
what's an umbrella doing here?
it must have belonged to one of the missionaries that the Jivaros killed.
strange.
seems to be a last warning. The bare-asses love flowery gestures.
I wish they would show themselves.
now it's Caruso's turn.
do you see the lndians in the canoe?
could that be a trap?
it doesn't look like one. No, I don't think so.
they would attack at night. And in bigger groups.
shall we stop and try to make contact?
no, don't stop. They wouldn't talk to us anyway.
something's moving over there.
those bare-asses have never seen the likes of this. Teach 'em some respect.
everything depends on how we behave.
tell me everything you know about them.
these Jivaro probably left the interior of Brazil about 300 years ago.
for ten generations they've been criss-crossing the jungle. . .
. . . in search of a white God in a divine vessel.
at the end of their pilgrimage he would show them. . .
. . . a land without sorrow and death.
we're gonna take advantage of this myth.
what the hell has that got to do with us?
if a bare-ass comes too close, I'll put a bullet right between his eyes.
yo.
Hey, I was doing some research for next year...
...and I think I figured out which website I wanna subscribe to.
the Vag-tastic Voyage. - Which one is the Vag-tastic Voyage?
the Vag-tastic Voyage is the one where...
...they find random girls on the street, and they invite them into a van...
...and then they bang them in the van.
it's like 13 bucks a month...
...and you get access to other sites.
like one's Latina, one's Asian, you know, there's one for fetishes...
...like feet and pee-pee and shit and stuff like that.
that's disgusting. You're like an animal.
I'm... What? I'm disgusting? You're the weird one, man.
don't make me feel weird because I like porn.
you're weird for not liking porn. I'm normal as shit.
peeing on people. That's normal?
Evan, I'm not saying I'm gonna look at it.
I'm just saying that it comes with the site, okay?
I don't know what I'm gonna be into 10 years from now.
I'm just sick of all the amateur stuff.
I mean, like, if I'm paying top dollar, I want a little production value.
like some editing, transition, something. Some music.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry the Coen brothers don't direct the porn that I watch.
they're hard to get ahold of, okay?
plus your parents are gonna be looking at the bill, dipshit.
Yeah, you're right. I probably should pick the one with the least dirty name.
what about, like, Perfect Ten?
something like that, you know?
like Perfect Ten?
because that could be any number of things.
they can't really get you for that. That could be, like, a bowling website.
Yeah, but they don't really show dick going in, which is a huge concern.
I didn't realize that.
Plus, have you ever seen a vagina by itself?
not for me.
Hi.
thanks for taking him, Seth. - No... No problem, Jane.
how are you? - Good.
beautiful.
don't touch that. - What are you...?
I'm not a piece of meat. - You two are funny.
I can't imagine what you're gonna do without each other next year.
Evan told me you didn't get into Dartmouth.
I got into some schools, some pretty good ones. So I'll be fine.
you gonna miss each other? - No. Miss each other? No, thank you.
I don't... I don't miss each other.
I'm gonna cry myself to sleep every night.
me too. - When I'm out partying.
go to school, boys.
Bye, Mom. - Bye, Jane.
I am truly jealous you got to suck on those tits when you were a baby.
Yeah, well, at least you got to suck on your dad's dick.
Hey, Seth, you can't park in the faculty lot.
don't be such a vagine, man. I gotta get a Red Bull before class.
you're being an idiot. You shouldn't have parked there.
fuck it. I'm about to graduate.
they should be sucking on my ball sac.
it's the least they could do for stealing three years of my life.
Oh, fuck me. - Look at those nipples.
they're like little baby toes.
it's not fair they get to flaunt that stuff and I have to hide every erection I get.
you know what I do? I flip my boner up into my waistband.
it hides it and it feels awesome.
I almost blew a load into my bellybutton.
I mean, just imagine if girls weren't weirded out by our boners and just, like, wanted to see them.
I mean, that's the world I one day wanna live in.
it's been two years since I've seen an actual human female nipple.
shauna? Shauna was two years ago now?
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess so. But she was insanely hot.
exactly. She was too hot, okay? That's what sucks.
how can that suck? I'd be psyched if I got with her.
you got, like, two dozen handjobs.
Yes, and three-quarters of a blowjob, but who's counting?
look, it was the peak of my ass-getting career and it happened way too early.
you're like Orson Welles. - Exactly!
if I'd paced myself, I'd be having at least steady sex with a decent-Iooking girl.
I honestly see now why Orson Welles ate his fat ass to death.
you'll have sex in college, everyone does.
but the point is to be good at sex by the time you get to college.
you don't want girls thinking you suck dick at fucking pussy.
I still think you have a chance with Jules.
she got incredibly hot over last summer...
...and she obviously hasn't realized it yet...
...because she's still talking to you and flirting with you.
are you out of your mind? Look at Jules' dating record, okay?
she dated Dan Remick, who's had a six-pack since, like, kindergarten.
Jason Stone, who looks like fucking Zack Morris. And Matt Muir.
Matt Muir. He's the sweetest guy ever.
have you ever stared into his eyes?
it was like the first time I heard the Beatles.
why would she end her high school career with me?
Becca dated Eric Rosecrantz for like two years.
Yeah, but he's a fucking idiot. You're a step up from that dick-Ioad.
that's why you need to stop... Will you get this?
that's why you need to stop being a pussy and nail her.
you could bang her before you leave.
and I'm not gonna dance around it, she looks like a good fucker.
I'm tired of you talking about her like that, man.
what, you can talk about her all day and if I say one thing, it's blasphemy?
well, I don't constantly insult her.
I'm not trying to insult her.
I'm just saying that she looks like a good fucker, okay?
she looks like she can take a dick.
some women pride themselves on their dick-taking abilities.
dick-taking abilities? You think that's good to say about someone?
the fucked-up thing is, I actually do, okay?
if a woman tried to compliment me on my dick-giving abilities, I'd be psyched.
Hey, yo, Seth.
what?
did you hear I'm having a big grad party next Saturday?
no. - Yeah.
Oh, shit! - You're not coming.
tell your fucking faggot friend he can't come either.
so Jesse wanted me to tell you, you're a fucking faggot and can't come to his party.
you really bitched out back there, man.
I bitched out?
you bitched out, man, you fucking Judas.
you fucking left me hanging.
did you want me to dive in front of his spit?
come on, guys, let's go!
this is bullshit.
pussy.
if I equals the square root of negative one...
...then I squared equals negative one. Okay?
in other words, if you consider I as a constant...
...you can then define the square roots of all the negative numbers.
so I is an imaginary number. It doesn't really exist.
if I equals the square root of negative one...
...then I squared equals negative one.
is this making s...? Okay.
okay, bye. - Evan!
Evan, hey. - Hey, Becca.
Hey, thank you for your pen. - Hey.
no problem. No, no, don't worry. No worries. You keep it.
you won't have to borrow one again because you'll have that one.
thank you so much, that's... - You're welcome. Don't worry about it.
so I was gonna ask you...
...did you hear about Jesse's grad party next weekend?
it should be fun. - I heard. L... It's a maybe.
Really? - For me at the moment.
my R. S.V. P. - Just a maybe?
so far.
there's so much other fun shit that's gonna be happening...
...that I can't really commit and, you know, hurt someone's feelings.
fun shit? But I never see you at parties or anything.
that's because of all the other fun shit I'm off doing.
I'd love to be at all of them, but...
why weren't you at Dimitri's on Saturday?
there was so many things going on.
I couldn't find a minute to make an appearance.
what did you do? - Saturday was a crazy night for me.
I had some friends over, we had a few drinks.
that's Vag-tastic!
I hung out in my basement, the chill zone, where we chill-lax.
like "relax" and "chill" all at once.
Seth's parents were throwing a party.
we got to hang around adults, which was a nice change of pace.
you converse, you talk to people and they have interesting stories.
I talked to a man who claimed he had climbed five mountains in his life.
then we went to a nightclub, which was incredible. This big, fancy one.
gonna look at tits right now! - I'm feeling crazy. I said that.
you got in? - We got right in.
wanna do this, 'roid monkey? - Fuck you!
then we called it a night. We were all just really exhausted.
what the fuck?!
you would've loved it. It was an incredible, unbelievable night.
that sounds like a lot of fun.
you know, I'd love to go do something like that sometime.
who wouldn't? I mean, it was like...
...me and Seth are always kind of cooking up these fun, sort of, little, you know, events.
I guess you guys are really gonna go crazy next year together.
we were going to, but we got into different schools.
Really? That sucks.
Yeah, I mean, it's not too bad. I mean, it should be okay.
not too worried about it, really.
don't worry about it. I'm not worried at all.
all right, well, thank you for the pen. - Yeah. No problem.
Bye. - Bye.
Bye, Evan.
Mrs. Hayworth, I joined this class because I'd be cooking with a partner.
but she's never here, and I don't get twice the grades for doing all the work.
I didn't invent odd numbers, Seth.
I know, but look at Evan, okay? Just look at him.
don't keep me waiting much longer. I'm getting impatient up here.
you know what I'm talking about. Miroki, you're embarrassing me.
I'm here in my unit, isolated and alone, eating my terrible-tasting food...
...and I gotta look over at that.
looks like the most fun I've ever seen in my life.
and it's B. S. Excuse my language. I'm just saying that I wash and dry.
I'm like a single mother.
we all know Home Ec is a joke, no offense.
everyone takes this class to get an A. It's bullshit, and I'm sorry.
I'm not putting down your profession, but it's just the way I feel.
I don't wanna sit here alone cooking this shitty food.
no offense. And I just think that I don't ever need to cook tiramisu.
when am I gonna need to cook tiramisu?
am I gonna be a chef? No.
there's three weeks left in school. Give me a fucking break.
I'm sorry for cursing.
all right, Jules' partner isn't here today either.
pair up with her. Station four.
all right. I'll give it another shot.
I'll give Home Ec another shot.
Yeah, Hayworth will notice this, if we cover it with chocolate.
the whole thing? - Just dump it on. I'm serious.
okay.
and now it looks professional. - That's really impressive.
it's beautifully done. - I think we're gonna get an A.
so, what are you doing tonight?
probably nothing. Why? - I don't know.
my parents are gone so I'm having a party.
I don't really know how many people are gonna be there,but you could stop by if you wanted to.
Yeah, I love parties.
Really?
I just don't really ever see you at them.
you know, it's a love-hate thing.
so, like, you know, right now, I really love them, though.
Yeah. - Good shit, right, Miroki?
Yeah.
Hey, Miroki, could we have a minute alone? Just... Thanks.
dude, Jules is having a fucking party.
Hey!
don't tell Fogell about the party. - Gangsters. What's up, guys?
I was just walking down the hall and Nicola was right in front of me.
she's wearing these tight white pants with this black G-string...
...and you could see right through the pants. It was so sweet.
it's 10: 33.
what?
I told her what time it was.
that's the coolest fucking story I've ever heard in my entire life.
can I hear it again? You have time? - Yeah, yeah, Seth.
I'll miss your knee-slappers when me and Evan are at Dartmouth.
while you guys are at Dartmouth, I'll be at State where the girls are half as smart and twice as likely to fellash me.
what are you guys doing tonight? Asshole.
we got nothing. Nothing tonight, Fogell.
no? Well, if nothing comes up, we can get shitfaced again, yeah?
you're always calling me a pussy, but today you're wrong.
at lunch, I'm going to the same place Mike Snider went to pick up my brand-new fake ID.
Yeah. Fake ID. Fake ID. I'm tight.
that's insane. Evan was like, "I heard about this party.
we shouldn't tell Fogell." I was like, "No, we should tell Fogell."
you could buy us booze now. It's awesome.
Yeah, I'Il... Sure, I'll buy the booze. Yeah, we're gonna get our drinks on.
we're gonna party and get crunk and rock out, dude.
if you're not in this class, leave this class.
Fogell! Hi.
okay. Gotta go.
well done. Seriously. See you after class.
you tell that idiot you're not rooming with him?
not yet. No.
all right, well, you better. That guy's the fucking anti-poon.
Seth, it's dishes time. What's the holdup?
we're getting a fake ID, so...
it's not like a big deal.
not a big thing.
well, at least we're getting a graduation party.
thank God, man.
I'm excited.
I would do terrible, disgusting things to hook up with Jules.
unforgivable things. - I hear you, man.
I'd give my middle nut to start dating Becca.
Becca's a bitch.
you know what? I'm seriously getting fucking sick of you talking about her like that, if we can be honest.
me too. - Why do you hate her so much?
you've never given me a reason. I think you like her.
fuck no, man! I hate Becca. - Why, man?
fine, Evan. Here it comes.
when I was a little kid, I kind of had this problem.
and it's not even that big of a deal.
something like 8 percent of kids do it, but whatever. It's...
for some reason, I don't know why, I would just kind of sit around all day and draw pictures of dicks.
what?
draw pictures of dicks.
dicks?
like a man dick?
Yeah. Like a man dick.
I'd sit there for hours, drawing dicks. I don't know what it was.
I couldn't touch the pen to paper without drawing the shape of a penis.
that's fucked. - No shit, it's really fucked up.
here I am, this little kid...
...and I can't stop drawing dicks to save my own life.
all right. I mean, I don't see what this has to do with Becca.
just listen. Okay?
your precious little Becca sat next to me for all of fourth grade.
and in the classroom is where I did the majority of my illustrations.
I was very secretive about this whole dick operation I had going on.
even I thought I was fucking crazy.
imagine what everyone else would think.
so I would stash all of my dick drawings...
...in this Ghostbusters lunchbox that I had.
so one day I'm finishing up this real big, veiny, triumphant bastard.
all of a sudden...
pussy!
you hit Becca's foot with your dick?
Yeah. I know.
Oh, my God!
she starts crying. She flips out. And she rats me out to the principal.
he finds this Ghostbusters lunchbox dick treasure chest and he fucking flips out.
he calls in my parents. Turns out this principal is some religious fanatic...
...and he thinks I'm possessed by some dick devil.
my parents make me see a therapist, and he's asking me dick questions.
they made me stop eating foods shaped like dicks.
no hot dogs, no Popsicles.
you know how many foods are shaped like dicks? The best kinds.
Yeah.
well, I don't... That's really messed up.
super gay. - All right, let's stop this madness.
let's just go get some dessert. - I can't, I gotta go meet my counselor.
I'm picking out my classes for next year.
so I gotta sit and eat dessert alone, like I'm fucking Steven Glanzberg?
I gue... Yeah, I mean, what do you want me to do?
I don't know. Nothing. It's fine.
just relax, man. I'll see you later. - That's fine. I'll be fine.
Hey, pussy.
fuck off.
just the one. Just the one. Not both.
so I'll call Andy and Greg. - Okay.
and I'll bring the '80s dance music.
Yeah, yeah. - Right on.
Seth! Hi. There you are. We were just talking about you.
here I am. - That's weird.
so you're coming to my party tonight? Because it's fully on.
Yeah, why? Should I not come? Because I could think of other shit...
Oh, no. No. I want you to come, I just...
you said something earlier about, like, a fake ID or something, right?
Yeah, I'm gonna get one. For sure, for sure.
I'm getting that for sure.
can you get us booze?
Yeah. I can. I can get you guys alcohol.
Really? Seriously? - Yes, for sure.
that would be awesome. Thank you.
because we were worried about that. That would be great.
Plus, you know, you scratch our backs, we'll scratch yours.
well, Jules, the funny thing about my back...
...is that it's located on my cock.
so you do want alcohol? You want some or no?
you do or you don't? You do want alcohol.
Yeah. - Either way.
well... - Either way. Either way's fine.
this is actually kind of a big favor.
because my parents left me like 100 bucks to feed myself for the week.
but the house is full of food, so I just thought I'd spend it all on, you know, extra drinks for the party, so...
that's really nice. I don't think I've ever done anything that nice.
it's cool? - Yeah.
okay. Thank you. - Awesome.
I mean, seriously, that's really... That's nice of you. Thank you.
so should I just get a shitload of different shit?
well, you gotta get me some Kyle's Killer Lemonade.
Kyle's Killer Lemonade. That's kind of gay, but I can get it for you.
so... Okay, so then we will see you tonight.
go to the ball, guys.
go to the ball, guys.
Evan. Get into the game.
kick it over to me.
Seth! Get off the field!
get out of here. They're gonna make me run laps.
just fucking listen, okay?
Jules and her stupid fucking friend asked me to buy her alcohol.
but not just her, for her whole party. You know what that means?
by some miracle, we were paired up and she actually thought of me.
thought of me enough to decide I was the guy she would trust...
...with the whole fun-ness of her party. She wants to fuck me.
she wants my dick in or around her mouth.
did you think that maybe she's using you to get her alcohol?
she doesn't want your dick.
she's got an older brother. She could have asked him.
she looked me in the eyes and said:
Seth, Mom is making a pubie salad. I need some Seth's Own dressing.
she's D. T.F. She's down to fuck, man.
p in vagi. She wants to fuck, man.
tonight is the night that fucking is an actual possibility.
you sound like an idiot. You're not gonna sleep with her.
no. Dude, I know I talk a lot of shit, okay?
but she's gonna be at the party and she's gonna be drunk.
she likes me at least a little. At the very least, I'll make out with her.
two weeks, handjob. Month, blowjob. Whatever.
and then I make her my girlfriend.
and I've got, like, two solid months of sex.
by the time college rolls around...
...I'll be like the Iron Chef of pounding vag.
can we talk about this later?
what the fuck, Evan? We're down two points.
fucking calm down, Greg. It's soccer.
it's soccer. - Fuck you, man.
Hey, Greg, why don't you go piss your pants again?
that was eight years ago, asshole. - People don't forget.
do you wanna hear the best part? Becca.
you do the same thing with her.
when you guys are shitfaced, you get with her.
this is our last party as high school people.
I've ignored my hatred for Becca in coming up with this plan.
I should buy Becca alcohol? - Yeah, it'll be pimp.
that way you know she'll be drunk. You know when girls say:
I was so shitfaced last night. I shouldn't have fucked that guy.
we could be that mistake!
have you talked to Fogell?
all right, you talk to Becca. I'll talk to that retard, Fogell.
don't worry.
Seth, get off the field! - Goal.
you're getting that! - No, I'm not!
Hey, Becca. Hey, hold up.
Oh, hey. - Hey.
Hi. Did you hear about the party tonight?
Yeah. Yeah, I just heard. It sounds awesome.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm going.
Really? - Yeah, I'm gonna go.
that's why I came looking for you.
me and the guys are gonna go to a liquor store.
and I just thought, you know...
...if you needed someone to get you yours, I could do that.
I could be that person.
Yeah.
Yeah, oh, that would be great.
that would save me such a hassle, because I was gonna beg my sister.
could you get me, like, a bottle of Goldslick Vodka?
Yeah. That's the one with the little golden flakes in it?
Yeah. The girly one. - That's classy.
well, I'll pay you back at the party.
no, you won't. No, it's my treat, miss.
Really? - Yep. That's that.
it's the first of many too, so get used to it, sister.
well, thank you.
Yeah, no problem.
I'm sorry. It was an accident. - It's okay.
I was gonna give you a nudge... A punch, the friend thing.
I didn't mean...
Hey, Becca. - Hey.
Hey. - Gaby.
what's up, Evan? - Hey, Gaby.
we should get to class. - We're gonna go.
so I will see you tonight. - Okay.
really, don't worry. - Okay. Sorry.
Bye. - Sorry.
Bye.
sorry.
Where's that sack of shit, Fogell? He said he'd be here.
I'm here with my thumb up my ass.
I did it, dude. I even offered to pay for it.
it was pimp. I feel like a pimp right now.
like one of those pimps. - That is fucking pimp.
that's what I was afraid of. - Why didn't I think of that? Shit.
SH... We're screwed.
okay? We're screwed. - Okay.
that's what we fucking get for trusting Fogell.
he pussied out. I know it. He fucking pussied out.
how'd he get into Dartmouth? I don't get it. He's got shit for brains.
all right, how else can we get alcohol?
yo, guys! What's up? - Fogell, where have you been, man?
you almost gave me a goddamn heart attack.
let me see it. Did you pussy out? - No, no, man. I got it.
it's flawless. Check it.
Hawaii?
all right, that's good. It's hard to trace, I guess.
wait, you changed your name to McLovin?
Yeah. - McLovin?
what kind of a stupid name is that? Are you an Irish R & B singer?
they let you pick any name you want when you're there.
and you landed on McLovin?
Yeah, it was between that or Mohammad.
why the fuck would it be between that or Mohammad?
why not just pick a common name?
mohammad is the most common name on earth. Read a fucking book.
have you ever met anyone named Mohammad?
have you ever met anyone named McLovin?
no, that's why you picked a dumb fucking name.
fuck you. - Give me that.
all right. You look like a future pedophile in this picture, number one.
number two, it doesn't even have a first name. It just says McLovin!
what? One name?
one name? Who are you, Seal?
Fogell, this ID says you're 25 years old.
why wouldn't you just put 21, man?
Seth, Seth, Seth. Listen up, ass-face.
every day, hundreds of kids go into the liquor store with their fake IDs and every single one says they're 21.
how many 21 -year-olds are in this town?
it's called fucking strategy.
let's stay calm, okay? Let's not lose our heads.
it's a fine ID. It'Il... It's gonna work. It's passable, okay?
this isn't terrible. I mean, it's up to you, Fogell.
this guy's gonna think, "Here's a kid with a fake ID..."
...or "Here's McLovin, the 25-year-old Hawaiian organ donor.
okay? So, what's it gonna be?
I am McLovin.
no, you're not. No one's McLovin. McLovin's never existed...
...because that's a made-up, dumb, fucking fairy-tale name, you fuck!
jeez, man. It'll work. Give it a chance.
did you move my...?
where is my car?
Oh, my God, man.
what did I say to you? I told you not to park here.
why would you park in the staff parking lot?
shut the fuck up, Fogell.
I mean, because you're not staff.
I know that, Fagell! I know that!
Evan, let's go to your house.
wait, are you guys still picking me up from work?
can you answer me?
man, don't you have any non-infant clothes?
it'll be fine. - Yeah.
why don't you just wear what you wore to school?
I can't do that. I can't let Jules see me in what I wore to school.
it's completely unbecoming.
no one's gotten a handjob in cargo shorts since Nam.
I have to kill these guys. You don't negotiate with terrorists.
Really? Yeah, that's what we should be talking about right now.
then why don't you go and get some of your own clothes?
that's the dumbest thing ever.
my parents will see that my car's been towed and I'll be grounded.
these fucking terrorists multiply like bunnies.
where did I leave the M16?
do you have any bigger clothes or do you only shop at babyGap?
fuck me. I can't...
that's fun. Why do they make that?
if you can't even win, then why am I fucking playing?
do you wanna go see what my dad has?
what the hell is that?
it's a fucking vest, dumbass.
I'm trying to look older. - You look like Pinocchio.
it's just a vest. - They got a lot of booze in there.
if we get it now, we can get to the party faster with Jules' shit.
no way, man. I work there. They know I'm not 25.
nobody said anything about you, dick-mouth.
you really fucked me on this one.
so now I'm gonna steal the booze.
don't do this. I promise you I'll get the liquor later.
Mike Snider's ID always works. So will mine, man.
Mike Snider's ID doesn't have one fucking name on it! Okay?
I thought you Dartmouth guys would be smart enough to understand that.
now Seth's gotta pick up all the pieces.
he won't do it. Don't worry.
I forgot to tell you, my mom said we can have the TV from the basement...
shut the fuck up, he's gonna hear you.
just be quiet. Wait until he goes away.
you still haven't told him that we're rooming together?
Fogell, shut the fuck up.
and take off your vest. You look like Aladdin.
okay. You got it.
how old are you?
you certainly are. That'll be 80 dollars.
okay.
thank you kindly. Will that do?
certainly will. Thank you, Seth.
Hey, thank you.
you dropped your purse, ma'am.
would you like some help?
well, that would be lovely, young man.
would you like me to buy you alcohol?
that would be lovely.
enjoy your remaining years. - I will.
enjoy fucking Jules. - I will.
don't do it, kid.
I never had a choice.
you fucking killed her!
No!
Where's all the stolen liquor? Did you hide it up your butt?
piss off! I was gonna do it, but there was a security breach.
you never would've done it.
let's go to a liquor store and watch your stupid ID get rejected.
wait, I'm gonna go put my vest back in my locker.
all right. Here we are. This is it.
you ready? Yeah? - Yeah.
here's the money and the list. - Change is yours. Keep the change.
thank you. What's the list for? - The alcohol.
we're gonna get alcohol for the whole party, okay?
we put a lot of time into this list, so don't fuck it up.
it's perfect.
ouzo, bourbon, spiced rum, Goldslick...
Goldslick Vodka. That's for Becca. Don't forget that.
raspberry vodka, Scotch...
and Kyle's Killer Lemonade. A six-pack.
this is a lot. I don't know if I can get away with all this.
what difference does it make?
I don't know, man. I'm, like, really nervous.
are you okay? - No, man. I should have wore the vest.
calm down. - What the fuck are you doing?
what if I go in and they turn me down, man?
then we're in the same place we're in now.
who cares? - It's fucking humiliating!
everybody sees them kicking me out.
what if they make me put the liquor back? I can't do that.
this whole thing is bigger than you, Fogell!
so grow a pair of nuts and fucking walk in there and buy the alcohol!
what if I don't feel like it anymore, Seth? What?
then I'll fucking kill you, okay?
I'll stab you through your fucking heart.
no, you can do this, man. Come on.
killing me won't get you alcohol. I'm the one with the fake ID.
then I'll cut your dumb fucking face off throw it over mine and get your ID and buy it my fucking self!
Oh, really? You don't have the technology or the steady hands...
...to pull off a procedure like that, so ha!
peace.
Fogell, just be cool, man. Get in and get out.
you're the hero.
sorry.
is there a problem here, sir?
no. No problem whatsoever.
sir, did you do this? On the floor?
no.
and you should really clean this up.
someone could really hurt themselves.
fuck my life.
we're so fucked. We're so fucked.
this plan's been fucked since Jump Street.
okay, just calm down. Just calm down, all right?
Hey, so did you bring a condom for tonight?
you brought a condom with you?
Yeah. I figured I might as well, you know?
I brought a little bottle of spermicidal lube too.
you laughed in my face when I said I'd be having sex tonight.
that doesn't mean you shouldn't always be prepared.
you didn't even bring a condom? - No.
no, Evan, that wasn't part of the plan.
you did this without consulting with me.
we've never discussed, like, any plan, but you keep saying we have a plan.
I had, like, a general outline. You know?
I was gonna go down on her for, like, several hours, okay?
she would love that. She'd be smitten. She'd go out with that.
or I dry hump the shit out of her leg.
well, I just... I don't see the harm in bringing one little condom.
and one little bottle of spermicidal lube?
Yeah, one little bottle of spermicidal lube.
Evan, that's psycho shit, man. - No, it's not.
that's, like, Charles Manson shit.
what, do you think Becca's gonna be psyched that you brought lube?
Oh, Evan. Thank you for bringing that lube for my pussy.
okay, that's... That's enough. - Fuck.
these girls are 18, they're not dried-up old ladies.
they're good to go. - Then I won't bring the lube.
Hello, Mindy.
I love that stuff. Been drinking it for years.
you know, I heard they recently decided to add more hops to it.
okay.
I'm gonna need to see some identification.
Really?
makes me feel young again. There you go.
Oh, shit, it's Cary Hutchins.
she had the biggest tits I've ever seen.
I heard she got breast-reduction surgery.
what? Making your tits smaller?
that's like slapping God for giving you a gorgeous gift.
she had back problems, man.
and it's not just making them smaller. They completely reshape them.
they make them more supple and symmetrical.
I gotta catch a glimpse of these warlocks.
let's make a move.
she's going around the corner. - Come on!
okay. Your total is 96. 59.
I don't believe it!
are you okay, mister?
what the shit was that?
I don't believe it. I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.
I don't know, man. I think she looked better before.
but now that she can jog comfortably, she's in the best shape she's ever...
what is this? What's that?
Oh, man.
holy shit, they busted Fogell.
how did this happen, Evan? Fuck, man!
his dad's gonna fucking kill him.
look, okay?
he assaulted the customer, grabbed the cash and ran out.
so...
How...? - How...? How...? How...?
say when, height-wise. - I'm gonna start up here, tell me when.
I'll start on the bottom and... - When.
whatever 5'10" is, he was 5'10."
ethnically, I mean, did... What...?
I mean, was he...? Was he like us, or...?
a woman?
female? - No.
is that what you're asking? - No, no. Was he...?
like... - What? What?
African? - Af... Af...
was he African? - African.
no. He was American, and he was like you.
he looked just like you. - He was Jewish. Okay, Jew.
it's an odd crime for a Jew. - They're pretty docile.
okay, so we have an African Jew wearing a hoodie.
look, I can't do this. I told you already, I have an exam tomorrow.
can you understand that? I have a goddamn veterinary exam!
goddamn it. This is bullshit.
this is some bullshit. I got an exam tomorrow. Forget this.
well, apparently someone has an exam.
how'd you know?
you. You're the one that got punched?
Yeah. - Okay.
first things first. What is your name?
my name?
it's M... McLov... McLovin.
Yeah.
now, what's your first name?
what?
your first name? - My first name?
technically I don't have a first name, so don't worry about my first name.
but we're the police.
we just wanna get the story straight.
come on. - Fuck, man.
come on! - He must be so afraid.
I don't believe this bullshit. I can't believe this is happening!
I didn't know you could get arrested for this shit. We need that liquor.
are they gonna take him downtown? - Fuck Fogell.
he got arrested, okay? We're on our own.
we need a new way to get liq...
fuck! The money, man! Fuck! How much money can you get?
why are you talking about money? What about Fogell?
that doesn't matter anymore. I lost a hundred dollars of Jules' money.
are we gonna bust him out of jail? Bake a cake with a fucking file in it?
fuck Fogell. We need a new way to get liquor, which is fucking impossible.
all right, you need to calm down. We need to think for a second.
we need to think this out. - Fuck thinking, we need to act!
what the fuck happened? - Just... Just get up. Slowly.
you all right? You okay?
I am so sorry, man. I am so sorry.
I didn't even effing see you at all, man. Are you okay?
so it's just McLovin?
Yeah.
that's badass. - That is badass.
really cool. - A badass name.
lot of people with weird names. - Chingy. Shakira.
we arrested a man-lady who was legally named "Fuck.
think he was Vietnamese, it was with a P-H.
but it's still shocking to see on a license.
okay, and how old are you, McLovin? - Old enough.
old enough for what?
to party.
can I see your ID?
Yeah, I think I have it.
you're an organ donor. - What?
I didn't wanna, but my wife insisted.
I give him shit for it too. All the time.
I say, "It's just like a woman. Even after you're dead...
...they wanna tear your heart out." - They wanna tear your...
I say it weekly and it's still funny. - It still makes me laugh.
really funny. - There you go.
I'm sorry, guys. I don't really have any information.
he just hit me, and I didn't see what he looked like.
I don't know if I can help you. - You in a hurry?
Yeah, kind of had to catch that bus.
where were you headed? - Near 13th and Granville.
we can take you there. - Get your information on the way.
why waste 2 bucks? - We'll take you. No problem.
please don't report me, man. We can figure this out, right?
why the fuck wouldn't I report you? You just hit me.
I'm gonna be totally honest with you.
I have a warrant out for a totally nonviolent crime.
okay? There. Mercy Street, guys.
I'll be honest with you for a second.
you better get us a shitload of cash or a shitload of alcohol...
...or you're going to fucking prison.
what are you doing, man? You don't need to...
no, let's not... Let's hang on a second here.
cough it up. - Fine.
I don't know if we should be doing anything too official just yet.
just take it. Just take it. Okay?
seven dollars?
what the fuck? This isn't enough. What are you, 6 years old?
it's all I have, man. It's all I have. - You better think of something quickly.
my back! My back. Cops, my back. - No, no, no. Wait, don't do that.
you want booze? I can get you alcohol, okay?
bro, I'm on my way to a party right now, okay?
there's, like, tons of liquor there, all right?
and I can definitely get you, like, tons of liquor, like so much liquor, so...
give me one sec to talk to him. - Stay right here.
just talk it out. Hey, I'm a nice guy.
I don't like this idea. This guy's fucking creepy, man. Look at him.
what? He looks like a guy. That's what guys look like.
what is your problem? - You guys know a guy named Jimmy?
you totally look like his brother.
you totally look like his brother, man.
you do.
you promised Becca you'd get her alcohol.
if you don't, she's gonna have a shitty night.
that's all I'm saying. Come on.
good luck on your exam tomorrow. - Good luck on your exam.
you don't wanna ride the bus. - Buses smell like piss, generally.
you know why? - Why?
people piss on them.
you know, one of you bros could've come up and sat up with me.
we're fine back here. - Back's fine.
safe in the back seat.
Oh, my God. - What's up?
Hey, Jules. - Who is it? Who's on the phone?
Seth. Hey, where are you?
I'm in a cab right now, on the way to a liquor store.
good. I can't wait for you to get here.
well, I hope your friends are ready to get fucked up.
I'm sure they will be.
okay, I'll see you soon. - Peace.
Oh, man! Dude, this is crazy.
she called, she said, "I can't wait for you to get there.
that sounds like she fully wants it, man! Oh, yeah!
who's gonna give it to her, huh, my man? You, that's who.
man.
you guys on MySpace, or...?
officers? I can answer those questions now if you want me to.
we get the gist of it. You were buying beer, some guys punched you.
don't worry about it. We're not gonna find them.
case closed. - But it was only...
but it was only one guy. - Only one guy? Shit.
how am I supposed to find one guy?
this job really isn't how, you know, shows like CSI make it out to be.
when I first joined the force, I assumed there was semen on everything...
...and there was some, like, huge semen database...
...that had every bad guy's semen in it. There isn't.
it'd be nice. Like that crime scene today.
if the man had ejaculated and then punched you...
...we'd have a shot at catching him.
no way. - Just punched in the face, no semen.
no semen. - Story of my life.
Michaels here, he's six months in.
he's young, but the Force is strong with this one.
learning you are, young padawan.
thank you very much.
that's Yoda. - Are you familiar with Yoda?
from Attack of the Clones?
we have a 245 at East 24 and Montgomery, Bailey's Bar and Grill.
car 98 on it.
see, Michaels, you always take a call at a bar because...
...better or worse, you get a beer out of it.
pretty sweet, huh?
true that. Amazing thinking. - Hey, McLovin.
we got a situation at Bailey's, so we'll drop you off after, all right?
actually, I kind of have to be somewhere...
sweet. Sit tight. - Set course for Bailey's, warp 10.
engage.
Yeah.
welcome to the Thunderdome.
Hey, man, are you sure it's cool that we're here with you?
Oh, definitely, man.
I'm essentially best friends with the guy...
...so a bunch of my buds are coming.
we're gonna rock out with our cocks out. Just kidding.
we are gonna rock out. - Just go, just go.
what's up? What's up? What's up?
Hello, hello. Hey, guys.
this is something a smart person wouldn't do.
look, just act cool and act casual, and try and look old.
we'll get the booze and get the fuck out of here, okay?
come on. Come on, now. It's Mark's party.
come on. Do it up.
we should grab one of these buckets and get out.
are you out of your mind? How are we gonna get a fucking bucket out?
Hey, man.
what the fuck do you think you're doing?
what are you...? What? Nothing. - You using my phone?
you weren't invited. Get the fuck out of here.
come on, Mark. It's cool, man. - You using my fucking phone?
you calling your fucking friends again?
you calling your friends, your fantastic friends?
get the fuck out of my house. Get the fuck out of my house.
get the fuck out of my house.
this is my house. - Don't be such a dick, man!
what the fuck?
mark! You really wanna do this, man?
here we go. We're really gonna do this?
that's right, motherfucker.
come on, pussy. Get up, dude.
Oh, shit. I'm sorry, bro. I'm sorry, bro. I'm sorry, bro.
tiger got out of the cage, man. All right? I'm sorry. Come on, Mark.
let's just chill. Everyone just chill out.
truce, man.
right in the nads!
this is for your friends. Here, have another one.
shit. Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit. Oh, my God. What do we do?
come on. Come on. - Choose one.
we can slip out the back, man. - Come on. Let's hurry up and do this.
are you crazy, man? Wanna end up like that guy?
not me. I need my nuts, man, for a lot of things.
we need liquor. - You need it. I don't.
I'm gonna tell Becca how I feel. Maybe she'll get with me.
I'm not gonna get her drunk out of her mind.
Oh, really? Then how come you never made a move, you pussy?
because I respect her, Seth. I'm not gonna put unfair pressure on her.
I don't see a problem. Let's just do it.
we're leaving, okay? You wanna get killed for liquor?
no, but I would get killed for pussy, no questions asked.
fuck this, man. - You're just gonna bail on me?
move, people.
thank you. - Oh, I love this place.
what the hell is going on in there?
if the bullets start flying, hit the deck.
you pissed everywhere, you son of a bitch!
everywhere? You didn't see me pissing anywhere.
I don't know what you're talking about.
take your nuts out of your shells!
Michaels, I got your back.
why don't you show this rummy how we roll?
10-4.
excuse me, sir. Stop what you are doing at once.
blue guys! - Resisting. Resisting!
Slater! - Michaels!
everybody stay calm.
everybody stay calm. - Get the fuck out of my way!
stay calm! Fuck!
should I shoot him? - No, no, no!
No! - Stop him, McLovin!
McLovin, stop him! Do it, do it, do it, do it!
please stop it, you fucking bum. What the fuck?
McLovin! Nice!
he just came at me. I took him down.
I'm buying you a beer, McLovin. - I'm buying you one too.
take note. That's how you take down a motherfucker.
that's right.
McLovin in the fucking house!
Hey. You dance hot.
thank you.
okay, okay. Here we... Here we go.
Hello? - Evan, it's Becca.
Oh, Becca. Hi.
Hey. Hello. Hey. Becca.
Becca... - Evan, can you hear me?
Hello? What? - Can you hear...? Piece of shit!
guy sells me a piece of shit fucking phone.
Becca? - It's Becca.
I get one bar everywhere I fucking go.
what is he saying? - Fucking asshole.
I think... - What happened?
Son-of-a-fucking-bitch phone company.
what? It's rude. Hello? - Fuck. You suck.
bullshit phone. Piece of shit.
I swear I'll bitchslap you so fucking hard.

Thanks.

Hey. Look what fell out of the truck!
you're full of shit.
Yeah, I know.
dude. Dude. We're so gonna get fucked up.
all right. - Hey.
what is that?
I don't know. What?
that fucking stain on your pants, idiot. What is that?
what are you talking about, man? - Dude.
is that blood? - What the fuck is that?
are you bleeding? - I'm not cut or anything.
why would I be bleeding? - It's fucking blood, man.
were you dancing with some chick in there?
Yeah, so? - It's blood.
dude, that's not funny. - It's blood, dude.
but why would I be bleeding? Why the fuck would I be bl...?
dude, why would there be bl...?
Oh, fuck. Oh, my God.
Oh, shit. I'm gonna fucking throw up.
someone perioded on my fucking leg?
Oh, shit. - What the fuck do I do?
I've never before seen that in my life!
this is so disgusting.
Yes, it is. - I'm gonna go get Bill.
he's gotta check this shit out. - Fuck, yeah.
no. Who's Bill? Don't tell Bill! Bill has nothing to do with this!
Hey, calm down. Let me get a picture of that real quick.
no, you can't have a picture!
dude, stop! - Bill, Bill! Check it out!
this kid's got period blood on his slacks.
it's merlot. That's what you don't get.
Hey, Pat! This jerk-off's got period blood on his pants!
please stop. - God, man, let me see.
Oh, my God, that's a fucking man-gina, man.
do you need a tampon? I could... - Wait, wait. I have one! I have one!
Yeah, right? I don't know.
I gotta wash this off. Is this the line? - What does it look like?
fuck me, right?
Yeah, I'm McLovin. I'd like to buy some...
shit.
rewind, rewind. - Rewind it. Yeah!
so hot. Let's see it again.
your legs lifted off the ground. - That is bona fide badass, man.
you gotta keep that tape, McLovin. It is badass.
it really is. - Really?
well, don't you guys, like, need it for, like, evidence or...?
the only thing that's evidence of is you can take a hit like a champ.
seriously. Take that.
are there any ladies we'd like to show this tape to?
no. You don't wanna meet a chick in a bar, man. Seriously.
that was a turning point in my life, when I realized that.
you gotta go to other places. You gotta go to a spin class, a farmers' market pumpkin patch, given the time of year.
just somewhere social, non-threatening.
you know, something like that. - Yeah, I met the missus at paintball.
Yeah, I shot her in the neck. And we just...
and we just hit it off, you know.
my first wife... Who is a whore, by the way.
where do you think I met her?
a bar. A bar.
it was this bar. - It was this bar.
Yeah, it was this bar.
bought her a Binion's, complimented her on her tote bag...
...and next thing I know, she's putting her mouth around the tip of my penis.
you don't have to tell me that.
right in there. - She opened up my world, sexually.
on our wedding night, we had group sex.
I wasn't involved in it.
but I could hear it through the wall. - I was.
she was amazing. And then it was exactly 23 months later...
...that I found out she was an actual whore.
we discovered her on the street. - Yeah.
I'm sorry.
she was bad. Fucking whoring bitch.
but you got a new wife now, so... - Yeah. Yeah.
and she is wonderful.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You'll meet her.
you know what? I bet I know your trick, McLovin.
you play the whole myst... - Calling all units.
just turn that off.
send backup! There's so much blood...
I bet you play the whole mysterious-guy thing, right?
Yeah, seriously. How's it going with the ladies?
it's not the going with the ladies I care about，it's the coming.
I get it. - What is it? What is it?
like:
like coming.
that's funny. That is really funny. - Oh, my God.
all right, looks like we got a call. We can't pay for these.
10-4. We'll be right there.
speedy Gonzales, let's go. - We should get road beers.
hell, yeah, we should get some road beers.
can I have 13 beers to go, please?
please. God, my fucking leg.
fuck.
I think it's him. - Is it him?
Hello? - Hey, Becca.
Hi, I had a bad reception. So about your Goldslick...
guys, shut up. - Hey, what's going on over there?
I was just calling, you know, to see if you were coming...
...because I thought maybe you were stuck at, like, a nightclub or a cocktail party or something.
no, no, I'm gonna be there for sure. Full throttle.
Charlie's Angels 2. - Awesome.
I can't wait to see you. Evan? - Okay, bye.
that was the first time I ever did coke. Off that bitch's nipple. That was so...
a little white sniff. - That was awesome.
that was gorgeous.
Hey, hey, hey. You guys, stay in this room, man.
they're gonna kill that guy tonight. That chick's boyfriend is pissed.
Yeah. He's a beast.
I've been praying for a fight. I'm literally waking up and praying...
...to see a fucking fight. - Hey, hey, hey.
who's that guy?
Hi. - Who is that guy?
who's this guy? - Pleasure to see you fellas.
Hi, everyone.
who are you? - I'm nobody.
no, no, no. I know you. I know you.
he was at that party I was telling you about.
no, no. - Who is it?
remember? He's Jimmy's brother. The guy. The singer.
no. - He's the guy with the beautiful voice.
the fucking singer, Jimmy's brother! - That's not me, man.
Oh, my God. - Sing for us! Sing.
it's not "me"? You fucking lying?
no, I don't mean to accuse you guys of being ill-informed, but...
my brother came from Scottsdale, Arizona to be here.
you're not gonna sing for him?
fucking bullshit. - Sing.
you're a fucking singer. - You sing good.
sing it again. - Like a bird.
no, I know, I just... I want to. - You want a line of cocaine?
no way, man. - Yeah.
don't make this weird. Sing.
sing it again. - Turbo.
fuck! Over! - Okay, watch this.
I'll get it right on the nose.
you're gonna fuck it up. You're gonna fuck it up.
under!
I feel hammered. That doesn't make any sense.
you're a fucking pussy. - Okay, okay. Great, great.
okay, McLovin, see if you can do it. - The kid's gonna nail it.
come on, McLovin. Do it, buddy. Come on, buddy!
bring it! - 0. 08, motherfuckers!
man! - That's my boy!
Yes! - Beginner's luck. Beginner's luck.
so, what's it like to have guns?
it is awesome, McLovin.
I mean, it's mindbl... - It's great.
I haven't had one for long, a few months, but I'll tell you...
...It's like having two cocks. - Yup.
if one of your cocks could kill someone.
can I hold one? - What?
can I hold one of your guns?
Yeah, sure. - Fine with me. Why not?
everyone should hold a gun at least a couple times.
Yeah, there you go.
have a blast. - "Have a blast."
that's funny. - I've never held one of these before.
are they hard to shoot? - Lf you're Michaels, they are.
he can't shoot worth dick. - What?
I can shoot. What are you...? Wait.
I can't shoot worth dick? - You cannot shoot.
I shot that cat last week. - It was already dead, man.
I still shot it. - That cat was dead.
there's only one way to settle this, guys.
Shoot-off. - Shoot-off.
Shoot-off! - Shoot-off!
mark. Mark, that's him. Johnny Cash.
right there.
Oh, you got a stain too.
we're blood brothers. - Shut the fuck up.
where do you get off dancing with my fiancée?
no, I wasn't dancing. I don't even dance. That's the thing.
I've never tried it. So it's weird that you'd think that.
to some girl.
talk about the hurting.
shit. - All right.
yo! Fight! - Move it!
go, check this out! - Oh, fuck!
and what the hell is this?
I don't fucking... It's detergent. - Yeah, what are you doing with it?
I got fucking blood on my pants.
get down.
what the fuck is this all about, man? Are you...?
well, fuck me. - Fellas.
Oh, shit, I've been tackled by little girls!
you die! You're next!
I should fucking kill you, you motherfucker!
hold him, Jimmy's brother! Hold him! - What do you mean? No. No way!
you humiliated me! - I'm sorry!
you used my leg as a tampon! - I'm calling the cops.
Evan! Come on! Move!
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.
Yeah. Fifth and Paysview. Hurry.
mark, I called the cops. You should hide your gun.
you're a fucking pussy.
don't listen to him, officer.
if you make this, we're no longer friends, Michaels.
you're a fucking pussy. - Cheating. You're cheating.
fuck me. - Oh, suck on my nuts, Slater!
all right, you... That was a lucky shot.
that was a lucky shot. - I rule.
I got jizzed on. All right.
can I shoot one? - Yeah, go nuts. Go nuts.
have a good time, man.
empty the clip. Empty the clip on it, man. Shit!
the cops! Bail! Bail! Bail! Shotgun, shotgun! Damn it!
shotgun.
what a rush. - What do you guys wanna do?
man, let's get drunk! - Let's get more fucked up!
you're fucking living the dream, Michaels!
Oh, man.
this is gonna be the best night ever.
got a 257 at Fifth and Paysview. - Shit.
all units in the area report to Fifth and Paysview.
car 98, that's you. Do it. - Fuck.
shit. - Shit.
car 98 on it. You dumb fucking whore.
Hey, did she say we're gonna get to shoot somebody or something?
Oh, God, I wish.
it's probably some lame house party. We'll drop you off after. Cool?
Yeah, man. Let's show these fuckers how we roll!
you fucking prick. - What?
you bailed on me. - I didn't bail on you.
Yeah, you did.
you said you were gonna do something and you didn't do it.
that's bailing.
you're the one that dragged me to that fucking party with those lunatics.
I didn't bail on you. - You bailed on me, okay?
you bailed on me this morning when Jesse spat on me...
...and you're bailing on me next year.
what the fuck? It finally comes out. That's good, man.
we were supposed to go to college together.
since we were kids, since elementary school...
...that's all we've ever talked about, us going together.
and you got into fucking Dartmouth.
you're making me feel like I'm a bad guy.
What...? I didn't do anything wrong. I got into a good school.
how the fuck am I supposed to get into Dartmouth? You knew I couldn't.
how fucking selfish are you?
you had no problem letting Fogell take the fall.
you don't want me going to a good school.
fuck, man! - So, what the fuck do you want?
I'm not gonna let you slow me down anymore, Seth.
what are you saying?
I've wasted the last three years sitting around talking bullshit with you.
instead of chasing girls and making friends...
...I've just sat around wasting all my time with you.
and now I'm going to college a fucking friendless virgin.
is this about Becca? This is about some girl, man?
I like her! - Who gives a fuck?
she's some fucking girl! You gonna go out with her?
what about after that? - Fuck you, you're a piece of shit.
fuck you! And next time you're pissed off about something...
...don't keep it inside for 10 years, say it like a fucking man!
don't touch me. - Fuck you!
Hey, McLovin, are the numbers on your side odd or even?
I don't know. It's too dark to see. - We got flashlights.
Oh, that's true.
where the fuck are we?
Hey, Slater. - What's that?
Slater.
now, young Michaels, you will die.
all right. Come on, stop it. I can't fucking see. I can't see. Fuck it.
like it? - Hey, fuck off, that hurts.
you stop first. - Not until you stop.
stop it, asshole. - Hey, you stop.
fuck you, Evan! - Don't fucking touch me.
why did you do that? - My God.
are you guys gonna make sure he's okay?
check on him. - You check.
you go out there and check on him. - Fuck that. You go.
balls. Okay, we'll both go out there and check on him.
I can't believe this is happening again. What are the odds?
fuck.
is everyone okay? - Yeah, we're great, thanks.
Hey, hey, where's the love?
he's okay. He's fine. - Stand right next to your friend.
get over there. - I got them.
you got these guys?
you boys doing a bit of drinking tonight?
no, officer. Not at all. Not... We... - We found those.
I don't believe you.
freeze. Stand right there.
we're telling the truth. - Keep it going.
don't be a hero tonight, guys. - Wrong night for that.
Yeah, do what you have to do.
spread your shit!
get on the ground! Loaded gun, ready to go!
spread your shit! Pussies on the pavement, fellas.
come on! - Please don't shoot, sir.
please don't shoot. Shut up and spread your shit!
I am the law! Okay?
now hold hands.
what? - Why?
you don't want an asshole where your face used to be, Whaling Jennings.
hold his fucking hand! - Fucking hold my hand.
there. That's not so hard, is it?
here, McLovin, have a cigarette.
smoke up. Life's short, you know.
suck it in, my friend.
suck it long and deep.
enjoy it.
McLovin, McLovin, McLovin.
you like Officer Slater and myself? - Yeah, you guys are awesome.
Thanks. We really like you too, McLovin.
so here's what's about to happen.
we're gonna arrest these guys...
...you're gonna write a witness report saying they leapt in front of our car...
...and there was nothing we could do. Sound cool?
Yeah, that's fine. - Good.
that's good. Pretend he's your little sister.
your little sister with the...
what the fuck?
Fagell?
shit! - Shit!
run! Run!
wait.
hold on, I gotta get all the booze. Seth, wait up!
McLovin bailed!
chase the kid!
stop!
that was a fast kid.
I want a ride! You hear me? You can't unarrest me!
stop!
McLovin! - Come on.
McLovin!
McLovin! Why?
McLovin, come back!
my hand! Monster! Nicole! Nicole, get Daddy.
get Daddy. - Get Daddy!
Oh, shit. - Get away from my kids!
you sick sons of bitches!
what the fuck?
Michaels, are you okay?
it's just beer. - Give me a break.
it's just beer. - Man up.
what happened? What, did you lose him?
he's a freak. He's the fastest kid alive.
this is not good. - He's the fastest kid alive.
fastest kid alive, my ass. Come on. What are we gonna do?
I'll shoot my gun in the air.
give me a fucking warning before you do it.
I'll scare him out of wherever he's hiding.
this isn't gonna do shit. Get in the car. Get in the car.
this is your fault, you piece of...
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. They shot Seth.
they fucking shot Seth, I know it.
holy shit.
holy shit. Holy shit.
should I run? - Yes.
fuck. Stop! - Stop the bus!
stop it! - It's stopping.
it's stopping. - Oh, thank God.
Hey, Evan, pay for me, please.
that's me and him.
Hey, hey. It's you.
mcmuffin.
you know this guy? - It's...
ain't got no cop people to help you keep your booze now, do you?
Hey! Back the fuck up, man, or I'll beat the shit out of you.
give me the booze. - Hey! Back the fuck up.
back the fuck up. Back the fuck up.
please, please, calm down, sir.
Goldslick.
get off the bus or I'm calling the cops.
eat shit, bum.
Oh, shit, guys. We're three blocks away, man.
we made it. We made it with the booze and everything.
we made it.
hold this.
I can't believe you still have the liquor.
it's awesome.
Yeah, I told you the idea would work. I fooled those cops.
I'm McLovin. I am McLovin.
why do you guys have detergent?
I don't understand why you were smoking cigarettes with those cops.
because I fucking rule.
we are so gonna get laid tonight. - I am. I'm gonna get laid.
we're finally gonna get our drinks on.
I can't believe Becca's bottle broke.
I'm sure it'll be fine. - Yeah.
I thought you didn't need it. You were gonna tell her how you feel.
good luck getting Jules drunk enough to have sex with you.
what's wrong with you guys? - Nothing.
you two femmes can talk about it next year at your little slumber party.
Oh, you told him.
told me what? - Yeah. You're an idiot, Fogell.
well, we gotta tell him now. - No, we...
well, he knows something's up.
what are you guys talking about? Tell me now.
Seth, me and Evan are rooming together next year.
what's the big deal?
Oh, my God, Fogell's rooming with Evan.
jeez, why don't you go cry about it?
I didn't tell you because... - You're a backstabber...
...and you lied to your best friend and you just don't care anymore?
I didn't expect this from you, Evan.
not from you.
give me that booze, Fagell.
we never should have had to hide our arrangement.
Seth's here. - Seth, you're here.
Hi. Everybody, Seth has got it.
Evan. - Gaby, hey.
where have you been? You almost blew it.
what are you talking about? - Becca. She's been waiting.
she's over there.
she's way smashed.
and she's been yammering about you all night.
Really? What was she saying?
she told you that she thinks I'm a good guy?
no, no. She said something more like:
I will fully blow him tonight.
what? - I know.
Yeah. - But she's totally hammered...
...and if I get with her and I'm not drunk, isn't that unethical?
not if you're drunk too.
I guess not.
to Seth.
to Seth! - All right.
who the fuck is Seth?
I'm Seth!
let's do another one to me.
Oh, boy.
calm down. Calm down, man.
calm down. She likes you.
she wants to suck on your penis.
it's a good thing.
it's the best thing.
just down the hatch.
Fogell. What's up?
Evan, hey. Evie, come here.
can you please help me up?
I fell down and none of these assholes will help me up.
shit. - Becca.
I have been waiting for you for, like, ever.
what took you so long? - I know, it...
do you have my Goldslick? - No, I can't even...
it's such a crazy story, okay?
I swear I was try... - It doesn't even matter.
look. Look what we... We can just drink this.
here. You could have a drink. - Oh, no.
I'm already pretty wasted. - Take a drink.
okay, here's to you. This is to Becca.
to Becca.
to the respecting... - Guys.
women. To people respecting women.
okay. Yeah.
you're a lightweight.
Hey.
you and me, we should go upstairs, because...
because I need to tell you something. Okay?
you could just tell me here, I mean...
I can't tell you, because it's a secret for you from me.
all right. - So come. Come on. Okay.
Bye, guys. - Bye.
Bye-bye. - Bye.
you changed your name to McLovin?
that's so cool. - Thanks.
so, like, what's Hawaii like?
all right. I am back.
I had to thank the peeps for coming out, you know.
Jules. I want you to have a drink with me.
just drink some of this. You're gonna love it.
you're to... I know you're gonna love it.
you know, l... - It's green beer. For your information.
you know, I'm actually good right now. But thank you.
and thank you very much for bringing everything, again.
seriously, it really made the night.
no, that's how I roll. That's the thing.
it's no problems. You'll learn that.
I love talking and conversing with you.
but I can't hear you, though, because the music is so loud.
so do you wanna go outside and talk more?
Yeah. Sorry, sure. You know, why not?
let's do it. I haven't conversed in ages.
okay. Ladies... Ladies first. - Okay.
thank you very much. - No problem.
watch your step. I fell earlier today. - You serious?
well, I was hit by a car. It's a long story.
Oh, shit. Careful. - Okay, well...
so loud. Don't let the parents hear.
you look so pretty.
are you okay? - I so flirt with you in math.
tell me about it. L... Samesies.
I've wanted to tell you for so long that you're the best girl.
I know. I've wanted to get with you, like, so hard.
like so hard.
you're the best.
we'll take this sweater off. I think so.
just be careful, because it's a meaningful sweater to me. It's vintage.
okay.
bought it at that vintage market. - Just hurry.
and this one. - It's off.
Hey, wait, careful.
Oh, shit. - Oh, my.
put that there.
now, looky, looky... - Okay.
...what I got for you under here. - Oh, my gosh.
you are the prettiest girl...
...this side of the Mississippi. - I have a little something for you under here.
you look so pretty.
look so pretty. - Under there.
hello.
for you.
you're the best. You're so unique.
come here.
Evan, kiss me.
I like you so much.
come on, McLovin.
I've never been with an older guy before.
well, it's way better.
I know, we made some kick-ass tiramisu earlier.
it was deli... It looked weird. But it was delicious.
What...? What's wrong?
l... I would prefer if we would just do that at some other time.
no. There is no other time. School is up.
what's wrong with right now? - Well, I mean, you're... You're drunk.
you're, like, really, really drunk. - So? You're drunk. You're drunk, Jules.
Yeah, I'm actually... I'm not drunk at all.
I don't even drink, so it's... I mean...
Jules, you drink. You drink.
everybody... You... You had me get liquor, so you drink.
it's like...
well, yeah, because I'm throwing a party, remember?
other people drink and so I just...
you...?
you don't wanna, you know?
not right now.
you know, not while you're drunk.
but, you know, thank you.
Evan. Evan, I'm so wet. - Oh, yeah.
they said that would happen in health, when I learned about it.
Yeah. - Yeah.
they taught me about... - Who's down there?
Yeah, it's your hand.
thank you, that's good. - You have such a smooth cock.
thank you. You would too if you were a man.
but you got such a smooth chest.
I am gonna give you the best blow-J ever, with my mouth.
why don't we...? Why don't we just kiss a while?
why don't we keep kissing for a bit, instead of...?
how badly do you wanna fuck me?
Jesus Christ.
Jesus, fuck.
hang on one second. - What?
Becca, I don't think you wanna do this.
you're really drunk. - No, I'm not. I am not drunk.
I see that you are. I think you are. - And I really... I want you inside me.
I want you to be my first. I want you inside me.
so just... Just go with it.
let it happen. - I know, but...
Becca, this is kind of intense.
and I just... I'm so drunk. I can't even, like, process this.
and you're really pretty.
and I just think this isn't how I pictured it.
I don't understand why you have to be such a little bitch about it.
did you just call me a bitch? - Yes, a scared...
see, I, like, I think we're not thinking clear...
holy shit. Oh, my God.
go get Gaby. - I'll go get her.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Go get Gaby, please.
I got a boner. - Good.
do you have a condom? - Yes.
and lube.
Seth?
are...? Are you crying?
no, I just have something in both my eyes.
I don't cry. That's funny.
you look... You look... It looks like you're crying.
so...
it was my last chance and I fucked it up, and...
your last chance to do what?
to make you my girlfriend for the summer.
you're, like, the coolest person that's ever talked to me.
I thought we'd both be drunk.
what does me being drunk have anything to do with it?
you'd never get with me if you were sober.
look at you.
look at me. - Seth, come on, you didn't blow it.
I think maybe...
what the fuck?!
help me.
Shirley.
I'm sorry.
someone forgot to call pest control. - Yep.
where you going? Hey, party's still on.
where are you going? - No.
if you're back there, get out. Everyone, come on.
we will shoot you. - Party's over.
Evan. - Get the hell out of here.
keep your hands up.
life's bullshit, Miroki.
EV, wake the fuck up, man.
we gotta go. Those fucking cops are here, man.
Oh, no, it's the cops. We have a complaint.
Evan, come on. - Get the hell out of here right now.
get out of here. She's not interested.
drop the crantini and move it, sister. - See you, sugar tits.
guys, come on, move.
everybody out. Leave the booze and go.
what the fuck, man?
what the fuck, Seth?
he's my best friend. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit. Come on.
I assume you all have guns and crack.
Oh, my God, come on. Don't stop.
okay, everyone prepare to be fucked by the long dick of the law.
get out.
come on, go.
fuck off, Seth.
get a room.
I'm gonna save you. I'm gonna save you, Evan.
fuck.
fuck. Fuck, man, so heavy.
it's in. Oh, my God, it's in.
all right, everybody out. Come on, let's go.
McLovin! What the fuck?
officer Slater, is that you? - You ran away from us.
why did you run away? Michaels, get up here.
no. I didn't run away. - What the fuck?
why would you do that?
I was disoriented from... - Were you violating that girl?
you just violated her with your penis? Michaels, look.
McLovin? - No, no, no.
no.
holy shit. Were you just getting laid?
no. Yeah, I was, but...
Yes, yes, he was. - It's not what you think, guys.
I'm not even... - Sit the fuck down. Stay down.
calm down. - I thought we were friends...
...and then you go running away.
contain yourself.
we're friends. - Shut up.
calm down. Calm down, man. - Why? What?
you just cock-blocked McLovin. Okay?
he's our friend. We don't do that.
we should be guiding his cock, not blocking it.
just relax, okay? Let's make this right.
wait, what are you...? What are you guys doing?
no, please, I can't... I can't go to jail. Please, I can't go to jail.
no, look. We're really sorry, McLovin.
this has... This has gone on... This has gone way too far.
what? What are you talking about?
we know you're not 25, man. We're not idiots, McLovin.
Yeah. - Did you know the whole time?
look, when we were your age, we hated cops.
when we saw you in the liquor store today, we just...
I guess we saw a bit of ourselves, you know...
...and we just wanted to show you that...
...you know, cops can have a fun time too, you know?
Yeah.
you know, in a way, I think we wanted to show ourselves.
also, I'm...
I'm really sorry that I blocked your cock.
apology accepted. - Seriously, man.
that feels good.
it feels so good. - I missed you guys.
I just wish we could make it up to you somehow, man.
well, do you think you can do me a really big favor?
what is it? Anything. - Name it.
this kid's fucking crazy. - Stay back for your own safety.
get off me, you fucking cops. Get your hands off.
do you know who I am? I'm Fogell.
the joint can't hold me. - Holy shit, Fogell's a badass.
I'm gonna break your glasses, you fucking cop. You can't hold me.
fucking pigs.
Oh, shit.
nice mullet, asshole.
you crazy. - This kid's crazy.
he's nuts. Well, we caught the infamous Fogell.
get your hands... Wait for me, Nicola.
wait for me on the outside.
we were gonna go to Hawaii.
man, that's gonna get you so much ass.
Seriously?
I know what to do about the car. - Sweet.
fucking go. Fucking throw up.
are you carrying me?
no, I'm saving you from the cops.
you saved me?
well, I don't know what you're talking about, but thanks.
can l... Should I just walk?
should I walk? - Yeah, sure.
okay. - Where do you wanna go?
sleepover at my house? You wanna come sleep...?
okay. - Okay.
does your mom still have pizza bagels?
Yeah. Lots.
pizza bagels.
so by signing this, you are officially saying...
...that as we stopped you from being mugged...
...a crackhead stole our cruiser and did God knows what with it.
you cool to sign that? - Of course. I owe you guys my life.
we owe you, Mc... Wait, what's your real name again?
Fogell. - Fuck that.
we're calling you McLovin. - McLovin.
let's do this dance, boys.
Oh, my God. - What did I tell you guys, right?
that was crazy.
all right.
all right, now, guys, check this out.
it's probably the greatest move in doughnut-spinning history.
you paying attention?
behold, the upward-spiraling pigtail.
why is it called that? - I don't know.
make the badge proud, Slater.
he's not usually this drunk when he does this...
...but I think that could make it more cool.
McLovin!
Oh, no.
fuck.
Slater! - Officer Slater.
all right. Fucking crazy.
let's do this.
hurry, hurry. Let's go. Go, go. - I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
I'm out, I'm out. - Good, here we go, here we go.
yeah? Yeah, okay. Back up.
don't blow yourself up, asshole.
Yes. Oh, my God.
it worked. It worked.
we won. We won.
can we shoot at it?
I don't know. Can you?
break yourself, fool.
tight.
listen, and then she said she was gonna give me a blow-J.
I can't believe she said that to you. - Man, you have no idea.
what was she thinking? - You don't even know.
I gotta tell you. I gotta tell you something, Evan.
what?
I was in your room, like, three weeks ago while you were taking a shit.
and I saw your housing, like, forms.
so I knew you and Fogell were gonna live together, you know.
I'm sorry, man, I don't know.
I should've told you. I don't know why I didn't.
don't... No, don't be sorry. I should be sorry.
I was being a dick. I was being a big dick to you.
no, l...
listen, Seth, I want you to know, I don't wanna live with Fogell.
I never wanted to live with him. I just don't... I ha...
I'm afraid to live with strangers.
I can't.
I can't do it.
I know, I know.
I can't believe you saved me.
you saved me.
I can't believe. I owe you so...
you carried me. I love you.
I love you, man.
I love you.
I love you. I'm not even embarrassed to say it. I just...
I lo... I love you.
I'm not embarrassed. - I love you.
I love you.
why don't we say that every day? Why can't we say it more often?
I just love you. I just wanna go to the rooftops and scream:
I love my best friend, Evan.
we should go up on my roof. - For sure.
like, when you went away for Easter, on your vacation, I missed you.
I missed you too. - I want the world to know.
it's... It's the most beautiful thing in the world.
come here. Come here, man.
I love you. - I love you.
what the fuck?
what up? - Morning. Morning.
I should get moving. I should get moving.
I should be getting a move on, for sure.
Yeah, you don't... I mean, you don't have to, you know.
I don't really have anything going on.
you don't have to rush off like that.
you wanna hang out?
I was gonna go to the mall.
I have to get a new comforter.
for college. The mall, they would sell that.
cool. So...
...your mom's got huge tits.
what do you think?
I don't know, man. Don't ask me.
because I don't give a shit how pants look.
Yeah, I need someone's opinion.
those are too tight. Those are way too tight.
Yeah, but, like... - Way too tight. You need to upgrade.
but when I was wearing your dad's pants...
...I realized that if I wear pants that are a little too small...
...it might encourage me to lose weight.
and also, chicks can kind of see, like...
...you know, the borders and outline of my dick a little.
Yeah, man, they go nuts for that. The male camel toe.
Yeah, the camel tail. It's right...
I know where it is, where it happens.
like, right there.
it's like they're so tight that one ball is, like, above my dick, even.
Yeah, exactly. - It's like three.
it's like a three thing. It's like ball, dick, ball.
it's like a division sign.
like a bunch of people crammed into a van.
you know, I just wish you would take these off.
you're right, these look stupid. Let's get the fuck out of here.
I'm really sorry about that. I can't believe I actually did that.
I feel bad that I'm making you buy me a new one.
it's seems, like, ridiculous.
no. I have to, it's puke. It's gross. - Oh, my God.
do alcoholics get hangovers?
holy shit, holy shit, holy shit. It's them.
what the fuck do we do, man? - Don't stop. I don't know.
Hey. - Hey.
how's it going?
it's so good to... How are you feeling?
I've felt better. But I'll be fine. How about you?
I'm okay, you know, yeah. Did you have fun last night?
you know, I actually don't remember much.
I don't remember anything.
so weird. - Nothing.
I didn't puke on you, did I?
you didn't. I remember that you... I avoided it.
it whizzed right by me, and I said, "Stay away from me," you know.
I'm really sorry about everything last night, and I just...
thank you for being such a nice guy about it all.
that's okay, you know.
at least you don't have a black eye from it.
that looks terrible. - Yeah.
you look great. You don't look terrible. It's just, like, a bad bruise.
everything's great, just from he... This, just like right there.
your eye. - Yeah, your eye.
everything else is great.
but seriously, I acted like a fucking idiot last night.
you don't deserve that. So I'm sorry.
on the upside, I think you look cool with a black eye.
I'm just gonna throw that out there. I don't... I don't know.
well, thank you, smart guy. Thanks. That's actually why I'm here.
because I have to get a ton of cover-up for the grad photo.
Oh, man. Fuck.
and I'm gonna get Jules a new comforter.
I have to get a comforter too. For college.
Oh, yeah? - Yeah, I just figured I would need one.
so, Seth...
so do you wanna come buy me cover-up or something?
I mean, you kind of owe me.
Yeah, definitely. I would love to do that.
I had such bad acne last year...
...that I pretty much became, like, an expert on the stuff.
well, you drove. Evan drove me here, though, so...
well, so... Well, I mean, I have my dad's car.
so I could just give you a lift...
...and then Evan could take Becca home.
if that works. I don't know if it's in your route.
it'd be fine with me.
fine, yeah. Maybe we can get some food.
Yeah, I'd like that.
so I guess I'll call you, then.
Yeah, give me a call. Yeah, you have my number.
I have your information. So put her there.
perfect. Good. All right, man.
okay. - Okay, guys.
Becca. - Bye, guys.
Bye, have fun. - See you, Jules.
Yeah, that's funny. Too funny.
where do you wanna go to eat?
so can you honestly help me figure out what kind of cover-up to get?
I love you.
corpsman!
corpsman!
for God's sakes! Corpsman!
corpsman!
corpsman!
what's wrong?
every jackass thinks he knows what war is.
especially those who have never been in one.
we like things nice and simple:
good and evil, heroes and villains.
there's always plenty of both.
most of the time, they are not who we think they are.
where is he?
where is he?
where, where is he?
Mr. Bradley?
Mr. B? You okay?
where is he? - Where is who?
where is he? Where did he go? Where, where is he?
all right. Just stay right here, okay?
I'm gonna call an ambulance. It'll be okay.
where is he?
most guys I knew would never talk about what happened over there.
probably because they're still trying to forget about it.
they certainly didn't think of themselves as heroes.
they died without glory.
nobody has taken their pictures.
only their buddies knew what they did.
I'd tell their folks they died for their country.
I'm not sure that was it.
now, there were plenty other photos taken that day, but none anybody wanted to see.
what we see and do in war...
...the cruelty, is unbelievable.
but somehow we gotta make some sense of it.
to do that, we need an easy-to-understand truth...and damn few words.
film's ruined.
I don't know. This one looks all right.
and if you can get a picture...
now, the right picture can win or lose a war.
you're gonna want to see this.
look at vietnam.
the picture of that South vietnamese officer blowing that fella's brains out of the side of his head.
that was it.
the war was lost.
we just hung around trying to pretend it wasn't.
took a lot of other pictures that day.
none of them made a difference.
Thanks. Appreciate it.
sounds ridiculous, but it happened.
country was bankrupt.
people were becoming cynical and tired of war.
Oh, my Lord, that's Harlon! - Where?
right there. Planting that flag, that's your brother.
ma, all you can see is his behind.
and that's his.
I powdered and diapered it, I know my son.
that's him. Go get your father.
daddy, Ma's got a picture of Harlon's keister in the paper.
you watch your mouth, young man.
thank you.
one photo, almost all on its own, turned that around.
it's on the front page of every major paper.
over 200 dailies and they're all flooded with requests for prints.
I think we might have found it.
corpsman!
corpsman!
corpsman!
I gotta go get him. - Oh, no, you don't.
Iggy, I gotta go.
I have a whole different theory.
he wants medical attention enough, he'll come to us.
Hey, shut up and crawl over here, you lazy son of a bitch!
as soon as that flare goes out. - Crap.
okay, well, I'll go with you. - No.
you're gonna leave me here?
I'll be right back, just...
shoot some people. I gotta go.
Oh, God.
okay, it's okay.
don't touch them.
get your hands out, let me do that. Don't look.
keep your head back, your eyes on me.
look at me. I'll get it. I'll take care of it.
we'll get this bandage on you. We'll get you taken care of.
and we'll get you down to the bottom, all right?
you're gonna be fine.
it's okay.
I'll do that. I'll do that.
put some pressure on that. Put your hands on top and put pressure on it.
keep your head back. Keep breathing.
keep looking at me, all right? Just keep looking at...
doc.
help me.
help me.
how does that feel?
it feels good. - It does? All right.
good. - All right.
I'm gonna go get a stretcher. I'll be right back.
I'm all right.
go and help someone who's hurt.
all right. Hold on there.
where did he go? - Who?
the guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
you jumped in the wrong hole.
I didn't jump in the wrong hole! He was right here, now where the hell is he?
Lggy!
Lggy!
shut up. You want every Jap shooting at us?
Lggy!
holy shit.
they expect us to climb this?
or something just like it.
so where you think they're sending us?
I think it's the desert, Franklin.
well, that makes no sense at all.
well, it's just military psychology.
they always train you for the desert on a volcano.
now you're just having fun with me.
Harlon, take your men right.
watch for Bedouins.
what's a Bedouin? - It's a guy with a camel.
well, jeez Louise, maybe we are going to the desert.
now, you tilt that to the right, but what if the bullet comes from the left?
bullets don't come from the left.
you know any left-handed Japs?
that makes as much sense as you showering with your shoes on.
you don't even know why you do it, do you?
because I don't tell you mean I don't know?
you do it because Mike does it.
I'll ask him.
so you cut hair back home?
some.
training to be a barber, are you, Doc?
no, I just studied it a little.
but not in barber school? - Nope.
let me guess, Hayes is winning.
chief, I had very little to do with Sitting Bull's death...
...so maybe you could stop taking it out on me.
different tribe. The Pimas fought on the side of the white man.
see, now that's smart. - That is smart.
Yeah. Worked real good for us.
good luck, fellas.
Hey, good night, Lindberg.
dead bodies. He cuts hair on dead bodies.
even I knew that.
who's in? - Oh, I'm in.
it must be a lot easier with them not moving around and all.
there's that.
you know what I been thinking?
well, they been telling us we need to buddy up...
...and I think we'd make pretty good buddies.
and how do you figure that?
well, you know, in that we have a lot in common.
so why do you cut dead people's hair, anyway?
I'm studying to work in a funeral home.
you tell a lot of people that?
you actually chose the Marines because they got the best uniform?
no sense being a hero if you don't look like one.
jacks.
Queens.
shit.
do anything on that reservation but play cards, chief?
all right, listen up, you sorry bunch of leathernecks!
we going over the side tomorrow which means we ain't long for this rock.
all right! - About time.
any man who doesn't have his masturbation papers in order...
...get them signed by tomorrow or he ain't going.
I got mine already. - Oh, yeah. I'm square.
wait. Why am I just hearing about this?
I don't have to repeat everything twice for you.
no, I didn't hear nothing about no masturbating papers.
heard they were running short.
you know, nobody tells me nothing. That's real nice, guys.
all right, get your ass over to the officer in charge of records. Maybe he's got more.
leave your smokes. I'll play for you. - Thanks, Mike.
listen, he calls you an idiot, you take it like a man, okay?
just do not leave without signing them.
I appreciate it, sergeant. - You got it.
what the hell happened to your hair, Rene?
look like a goddamn corpse.
three points of contact on that rope at all times.
next four. Over the side.
let's go. Keep moving.
next four, over the side.
just keep your eye on the guy below you.
that's all you gotta look at.
watch me, Doc, just watch me.
keep three points of contact on the rope at all times.
you see? No big thing.
just one step at a time and keep your hands on the vertical rope.
once you're in the boat, move away.
make sure you keep three points of contact on the rope.
I got him!
all right, get that man out of the water.
give me a hand.
don't worry about him, Doc.
all right, quit skylarking! Keep it moving.
he'll be fine.
our target, Island X is an ugly, smelly, dirty little scab of rock called lwo Jima.
it means Sulfur Island, which accounts for the smell.
looks sort of like a burnt pork chop, you ask me.
after 20 straight days of bombing you won't find a blade of grass or a twig on it. It wasn't that pretty to start with.
captain?
Lwo's just five and a half miles long, two and a half wide.
there's a lump down at the bottom. That's Mount Suribachi.
on the maps in front of you the island is white.
not much of it.
the black dots represent known enemy emplacements.
coastal defense guns, dual-mount dual- purpose guns, covered artillery.
rifle pits, foxholes, antitank guns...
...machine guns, blockhouses, pillboxes, and earth-covered structures.
I don't see any barracks or any other structures.
that's right.
and we still don't know why.
now, this isn't just any island to them.
this isn't Tarawa, Guam, Tinian, or Saipan.
this is Japanese soil, sacred ground.
twelve thousand Japanese defenders in eight square miles.
they will not leave politely, gentlemen.
it's up to us to convince them.
the 28th will land here at Green Beach.
the 8th Ammo company will land here to resupply.
the Suribachi's guns are the problem.
they can hit any point on the island.
we're sitting ducks until we take them out.
that's our job.
we cut across the island, right at the base, slit its throat, lop off its head.
and we take that mountain.
we take that mountain, we take their big guns.
we take their eyes.
okay, I'm heading in. Follow me.
let's put a good show on for the Marines.
close it up. Take it right down to the deck.
Yeah, boys!
man overboard portside!
see him?
throw me a line! - He's right there.
where is he? - Watch out, watch out, watch out.
hawaii's that way!
just keep paddling, Mac, we'll catch you on the way back!
hold on, they're gonna lower a raft!
they're not gonna stop.
what?
none of them are. They can't.
so much for "no man left behind.
sir. - Come on in.
look, I've had to make a few other changes. I'm promoting you to platoon sergeant.
thank you, sir. I appreciate it. - You bet.
trouble is, I already told my men I'd see them through this.
that your James cagney impersonation?
because I've heard better.
well, I'll keep practicing, then.
this isn't your first time. You don't need to prove anything.
no, sir.
you're not the best sergeant, you're just the best one that's still walking.
block's a good man.
Yes, sir, he is.
the men know him, he can step right in.
you know, I have actually thought this through.
platoon sergeant puts you further away from the bullets.
I already gave them my word, sir.
I told them I'd bring them all home.
which means I already lied to half of them. Can't lie to the rest.
how are your men?
they'll do fine.
except maybe Gagnon.
our own Tyrone Power?
Yes, sir. He's a good man, just might be better use further back from the lines.
I'll use him as a runner.
all right. Thank you, sir.
now get out of here.
hear the good news, Doc? We're going in with the first waves.
Hey, you do that again I'll take your head off!
fucking dominoes.
Iggy, have you ever heard news you considered to be bad?
the first ones off the ship, Doc.
we don't go over the side of the ship.
we hop on a tractor, they drive us right there.
Oh, shit, that is good news.
you see? What did I tell you?
what's going on?
I'm going up to take a look. - Let's go.
let's go topside. Come on!
I'll go with you. - Come on, come on!
what the hell?
let's go, let's go! - Right behind you.
look at that.
we're killing them!
we're killing them, Doc.
I was promised 10 days of shelling.
you're giving me three and saying that's the best you can do?
I don't give a shit! My men hit that beach with less than 10...
...and I'll be taking them home to their mamas in buckets!
Yeah, I know exactly why.
because every Navy man with a scrambled egg on his chest...
...wants to offload us here and sail to Japan so they can be there for the big finish.
tell their kids they captured the emperor all by themselves.
well, you aren't going to Japan unless we take this piece-of-shit island!
these little pricks are dug in!
okay. Appreciate that, Jim.
three days is a fucking beautiful thing.
sharpen your knife or bayonet?
I'm okay.
sharpen your knife or bayonet?
Jesus, lggy, just leave me alone, all right?
how about you guys? Knife? Bayonet? Kick in the ass?
how about you, Doc? Sharpen your knife?
you sharpened it three times already.
then I better make sure I didn't nick it.
good man, Doc.
Hey, Doc. - Yeah.
when we land, try not to wave this kit around too much.
they got sharpshooters trained to look for them.
they know that if they take out a corpsman another dozen Marines will die unattended.
okay, Mike.
Yeah, right there.
close the damn door. For God's sake.
Yeah, like that's gonna help.
that your girlfriend, chief?
bet she's a pretty damn good-looking squaw.
bet you're missing her, and that little wigwam of yours.
welcome, all Marines off Iwo Jima.
we have a long-time wait...
it's what they do to prisoners...
...at least the lucky ones.
Jesus.
if I were you, cowpokes, I wouldn't think about waving a white bandanna.
poor Marines, so far from home for no good reason.
think of your girls back home, waiting for you.
but a girl cannot stay home every night...
...so who do you think they're with tonight?
and will she let him kiss her?
and will he comfort her at your funeral?
this sweet music is to make you think of your girls back home...
...who are missing you.
this is all for now. I'll see you tomorrow night.
we're clear!
get up the berm!
Baker company, move out!
seen Second Platoon? - I don't see them.
first squad, move out!
God, this place reeks.
go, go, go! - Move out!
go, go, go! Go, go! Go! Go, go!
drop your packs! Go!
all clear!
Jesus, you needed some exercise?
he got lost. 100 landing craft heading for one beach and this guy gets lost.
I'm glad we did. Jesus, what a mess.
any theories why they ain't shooting?
it's getting on my nerves.
maybe they're all dead.
what do you think, Doc?
you think they're all dead? - Keep moving, Easy company! Let's go!
Mike, take six men and bring that gun onto the beach.
second Platoon, let's move out! Stay down. Come on.
move! Move!
get down! - Take cover!
move out!
go, go! Get up on the beach! Get up on the berm!
go, go, go!
cover fire! Pour it on!
ray, shift your fire to the right, now!
corpsman!
I'm gonna sling your arm and then I'll give you a shot for the pain.
move, move! Off the beach! Take cover!
dig in! Dig in!
first Platoon! Move, move!
you got a girl back home, Marine?
we're gonna make sure she sees you, all right?
Hey, I need pressure on this wound!
see anything?
negative! Pull that fire team up!
Where's the fire coming from?
where are they?
look for a flash, shoot at it!
let's go, let's...
move it out! - Move, move! Let's go!
twelve o'clock, take out the bunker!
you're over!
third Squad, forward! Move!
where are they, sir?
we got ten o'clock! Ten o'clock, pillbox! Sergeant!
sergeant. I think I can clear that out.
all right, you go. Here.
take these. Check your weapon.
yeah? Go! Cover! Cover him!
cover, cover!
son of a bitch.
let's go! Go! - Move it out!
go, go, go!
down, down, down!
it's clear. - Good work.
I thought you said it was clear!
it was!
shit, I guess they're not in there firing at us then.
Lindberg!
Yeah!
light it up!
I'll over you, Ice! - Don't cover shit!
there's already enough people shooting.
one bullet and this thing goes up like a Roman candle.
go! Shift fire!
shift your fire! - Go, go!
shift your fire!
go! Go!
hit the deck! Stay down! Wait for support!
is this a bad battle or what?
it's a fucking slaughter. - Get down!
corpsman!
christ Jesus!
get a machine gun team set up over here now!
corpsman! Corpsman!
thank God! Tanks! Runner!
get those tanks up here!
Oh, shit. - Man. Get down!
corporal, watch your left flank!
let's go without them! - Let's go!
move out! Move out! - Let's go!
let's go, move it. Let's go!
lggy, you gotta lift your side, he's gonna roll off.
got it, Doc!
incoming!
corpsman!
move, move, move!
everybody off the LvT, now!
give them cover fire!
corpsman!
keep moving!
get that LvT up on the beach!
keep moving!
you're next, pal, we're getting you out of here.
move it!
great news.
maybe if you live up on camp Tarawa, because that's where we're headed.
not you and me.
captain Severance asked me who else was in that picture.
christ if I could remember...
...but it was Mike and Doc and Franklin and me and Hank Hansen...
...but I just remembered, you were there too.
I wasn't there.
of course you were.
neither was Hank. He raised the first flag.
Harlon Block raised that one.
shit. I told them it was Hank.
if you weren't there, how'd you know it was Harlon?
you tell them it was me?
no. I just remembered.
good, keep your mouth shut.
they know there was somebody else, by the picture.
pick someone dead.
they don't want somebody dead...
...they want to ship us back to the States.
what did I tell you?
I wasn't there. You hear? - All right.
just settle down.
I'm not going anywhere.
you're not going anywhere.
you wounded, son?
no, sir.
did you take out a nest of Japs butt-naked with your bare hands?
because if I'm gonna give up my seat...
...to a hero, he better have a good goddamn story to tell.
no, sir.
then enjoy it, because they'll forget you before christmas.
sixth man, you got a name?
sorry, still don't remember.
damn shame, because I promised the major you'd know who it was.
fact, you not knowing throws a doubt on you being one of the flag-raisers yourself.
since no one wants to be embarrassed, the moment you land...
...they'll turn around, ship you to okinawa to meet your buddies on the beach.
so why don't you stop screwing with me?
give me a damn name.
Gangway! Gangway! Let's go, let's go! Gangway!
where the hell is that son of a bitch? Hayes! Hayes!
Hayes, get your red ass over here! Looks like I don't know...
...what my men are doing with a flag the size of my mother's house?
goddamn it, Ira, you shouldn't have lied to me.
made me look like a complete asshole.
we're gonna miss you around here. Good luck.
now your name's in the paper too.
just heard your doctor say we're postponing your operation.
you're being shipped back to the mainland.
everybody who saw that picture thought planting the flag meant victory.
that's all they wanted to know. Victory.
within a few weeks of that picture being taken, half the men in it were dead.
Mrs. Hansen. Mrs. Hansen. Did you know Hank was a hero?
are you proud of him?
what was he like as a boy?
look this way, please, ma'am. - What do you have to say about your son?
but, somehow, being a part of it meant something.
looking at it, you could believe their sacrifice was not a waste.
Yeah, I might have thought that was Harlon too.
it is.
belle, their names are right here.
it's not him.
and he would be alive and sitting right here if it wasn't for you.
you think about that when you look at his picture, Ed.
and I need to rush home and change because there's the governor's banquet...
...and then there's the parade.
imagine, the governor is coming here to meet us.
now, I'm wearing blue so...
we interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin from CBS World News.
a press association has just announced that
president Roosevelt is dead.
the president died of a cerebral hemorrhage.
all we know so far is that the president died at Warm Springs in Georgia.
further updates every hour.
temperatures will remain the same today, in the mid-30s to low-40s with clear skies.
Hello?
Yes. Of course.
no, we understand. It wouldn't be right.
thank you.
here he is, gentlemen.
senator Boyd, Senator Robson.
senator Haddigan, I'd like you to meet Private First class Ira Hayes.
damn good to meet you.
proud to make your acquaintance, son.
sorry?
that's Pima Indian talk, don't you know your own language?
took forever to memorize the damn gibberish.
sorry, I've been away from the reservation too long, senator.
doc. - Ira.
and now, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
that's you. - Go, go, go.
please welcome...
Yeah. Yeah.
holy shit.
come in, come in, come in.
bud Gerber, Treasury Department.
rene Gagnon. - Bud Gerber.
showing the boys the sights?
saw a hell of a ball game.
that's great. The bar's there, help yourself.
I got some briefing sheets for you, some simple things we want you to say.
mostly "Buy bonds." Can't say that too often.
itineraries, those'll change every minute.
everybody wants to meet you guys.
I got women sending up envelopes with stockings in them...
...notes written in lipstick.
we won't mention that to the press.
have a drink, for chrissake.
my God, what you boys must've seen over there.
I've been watching the newsreels. Jesus christ, that was a fight and a half.
so...
...we got a hell of a lot of money to raise, not much time.
white House tomorrow, then you shake hands...
...with a couple hundred congressmen who won't pull out a penny.
politicians and actors.
put them in a restaurant, they'd die before paying the check.
then New York city, Times Square...
...dinners with various hoi polloi, then chicago.
who are these "Gold Star Mothers"?
that's what we're calling the mothers of the dead flag-raisers.
you present each mother with a flag, they say a few words...
...people will shit money.
it'll be so moving.
but this says Hank Hansen's mom.
lovely woman. She knows how close you and her son were.
he wrote home about you.
she is very, very much looking forward to meeting you.
Hank wasn't in the picture.
sorry?
Hank didn't raise that flag.
he raised the other one, the real flag.
the what? The real flag? There's a real flag?
ours was the replacement flag.
we put it up when they took the other one down.
am I the only one getting a headache here? You know about this?
it was after it was already in the papers.
the mothers had already been told, but...
that's beautiful. Yeah, that's beautiful.
Yeah, why tell me?
I'm only the guy that has to explain it to 150 million Americans.
who's in the goddamn picture?
are any of you guys in the goddamn picture?
Yeah, we're in the goddamn picture.
six guys raising a flag over lwo Jima. Victory is ours.
you're three of them? - This was the fifth day.
the battle went on for 35 more.
What'd you do, raise a damn flag every time you stopped for lunch?
can I hit this guy?
I don't give a shit, you raised the flag, that's the story we're selling, boys.
are you deaf? Hank isn't in the picture.
Harlon is in the picture.
well, who the fuck is Harlon?
Harlon Block.
that's whose mother who should be here if anyone's should be.
you know, I think this whole damn thing is a farce, if you ask me.
you know what they're calling this bond drive? The Mighty Seventh.
they might've called it the "we're Flat Broke so we're Begging for Pennies..."
bond drive, but it didn't have the ring.
they could've called it that...
...because the last bond drives came so short we printed money instead.
ask any smart boy on wall Street...
...our dollar is next to worthless, we borrowed so much.
and nobody is lending any more. Ships aren't being built.
machine guns, bazookas, hand grenades, zip.
you think this is a farce?
you want to go back to your buddies?
stuff some rocks in your pockets because that's all we got to throw at the Japanese.
and don't be surprised if your plane doesn't make it...
...because the fuel dumps are empty.
and our good friends the Arabs are only taking bullion.
if we don't raise 14 billion dollars... And that's million with a "B.
this war is over by the end of the month.
we give the Japanese whatever they want and we come home.
you've seen them fight, and they sure as shit ain't giving up.
fourteen billion.
the last three drives didn't make that much altogether.
people on the street corners, they looked at this picture and they took hope.
don't ask me why, I think it's crappy, myself.
you can't even see your faces.
but it said, "we can win this war, are winning this war...
...we just need you to dig a little deeper.
they wanna give us that money.
no, they want to give it to you.
but you don't want to ask for it, give them hope.
you want to explain about this person and that flag.
well, that's your choice.
because if we admit we made a mistake, that's all anybody'll talk about...
...and that will be that.
gentlemen.
Mr. President, here they are.
well, hello. Good to see you. - Mr. President.
darn good to see you, boys.
heard you had a hell of a fight on your hands out there, hell of a fight.
IRA, you're off the Gila River Reservation in Arizona, am I right?
Yes, Mr. President.
being an Indian, you are a truer American than any of us.
bet your people are proud you're in that uniform.
very proud, sir.
they should be.
thank you for coming all this way...to washington to help us out.
you fought for a mountain in the Pacific...
...now we need you to fight for a mountain of cash.
I don't expect you'll let us down.
no, sir.
no, sir. - Good. Then go get it.
that's the end of this ceremony.
let's take a look at this famous photo over here, see if I can pick you out.
my gosh. There you are.
boys. Boys, this one's on me.
to those who can't be with us.
Yes, sir.
excuse me, Mr. Gagnon. May we have your autograph?
I suppose.
and your name is?
I get the impression I'm drinking with the wrong heroes.
you're such a hero. I feel honored to be in your presence.
that's just not true.
that's professional work. Here, to professionals.
here they are.
you're the guys in the photograph, right?
I heard you were on the train.
let me shake your hands. John Tennack.
John Bradley.
these boys, Harvard and Yale types, didn't fight.
Pappies all rich sons of bitches.
boys, shake hands with some real war heroes.
excuse me for one moment.
buy them a drink while you're at it.
drinks for these men all the way around.
and you're the other one,
John Tennack, Tennack Homes.
rene Gagnon. - Pleased to meet you. Have a drink.
and here's my card.
listen to me, Rene.
when you get finished being famous, you come see me...
...because if you can sell bonds, you can sell homes.
now, they're not gonna build homes anymore, they're gonna deliver them.
heard of prefab homes? - No, sir.
well, you will.
and you hang on to that card and you come see me, you hear?
all right? - Certainly will.
all right.
it's all right.
this sure takes it, huh, Doc?
if Mike and the guys could see us.
Yeah, they'd hardly believe it, would they?
Harlon!
Franklin!
can you imagine Franklin...
...on this train...
...eating at the dining car with all the silver?
we shouldn't be here, Doc.
Ira! Hey, Ira. We heard the picture was posed.
what?
we heard you posed the picture!
Hey, Doc.
we're bigger than life, Doc.
Hey, good job. - Thank you.
thank you, girls. And now...
...Here are the men you've been waiting to meet...
...the men in white.
right behind me, here, the heroes of lwo Jima:
private First class Rene Gagnon...
...Private First class Ira Hayes...
...and Navy corpsman John "Doc" Bradley!
thank you.
it's good of you people to come out tonight in support of the war effort.
we really need you to buy bonds, that's for sure.
because we can't win the war without your help.
as far as us being the heroes of lwo Jima...
...that's just not the case.
we really didn't do much at all.
especially him.
especially me.
I was just a runner. That's it.
we put up a flag.
the pole we attached it to was heavy, so it took a number of us.
we had our picture taken doing it.
the real heroes are dead on that island.
and we'd appreciate it if you bought bonds in honor of them. Thank you.
jump on any grenades, Ira?
take out any machine gun nests I missed?
at least I fired my weapon. - All right, knock it off.
you hit anything or were you too drunk then too?
Hey, hey, hey. Guys! Come on.
stop it. Knock it off.
sit between these two boys.
for us and they need our help.
and if you think about it, I think you'll realize...
...that buying more bonds is not just the right thing to do...
...but the only thing to do.
Yes, this war has gone on too long.
we have given too many lives.
and its cost...
chocolate or strawberry, sir? - Strawberry.
has been far too high. But if we waver now...
...if we don't dig deep and give more than we think we can...
...then those sacrifices would be wasted...
chocolate or strawberry, sir?
...and those lives lost in vain.
move! Go, go!
stuck in the sand. Captain says go without them.
Christ.
real good work you're doing there, Rene.
prepare to move out. Pass the word.
prepare to move out! - Second Platoon!
move! Move!
all right, Second Platoon, on your feet!
let's move out! - Jackass.
let's move out! - Go, go, go!
move, go, go, move, move!
corpsman!
doc!
doc, get out of there!
corpsman!
doc!
doc, get the hell out of there!
may I have your attention, please?
train number 48, with service from New York City...
...Boston, Rochester, New York...
...Toledo, Ohio,
south Bend, Indiana...
...is now arriving on Track 7.
train number 48, now arriving on Track number 7.
okay, let's go. Let's go.
come on, let's go. - Boys.
watch your step, now. - Thank you very much.
here you go. - Thank you.
watch your step. - Let me help you, ma'am.
ladies and gentlemen, may I present the heroes of lwo Jima.
navy corpsman John "Doc" Bradley.
private First class Ira Hayes.
excuse me, let me through, please.
and Private First class Rene Gagnon.
Rene! That's my boyfriend!
who the hell is that? - I don't know.
Rene, is that your girl?
Hey, what do they call you?
Hey, look at that!
what's your name, doll? What's your name?
Hey, she's a beauty.
let's go find a saloon.
smile, boys. Give them their money's worth.
Hey, Doc, how's the tour going for you?
where exactly are you staying?
Oh, I'm not sure yet. - Just forget about that.
who's the dreamboat?
Hey, Rene, a big smile.
come on, one more shot.
senator, I'd like you to meet corpsman John Bradley.
doc, right? - Yes, sir.
good to meet you.
now, we appreciate everything you've done...
...and everything you're doing.
thank you, sir.
this is captain white.
Colonel Johns.
we're proud of you, corpsman.
and then colonel Mccourtney.
major General Green. - Nice to meet you.
senator, this is Private First class Ira Hayes.
of course.
now, I hear you used a tomahawk on those Japs, is that true, chief?
no, sir.
well, tell them you did. Makes a better story, huh?
Attaboy. - This is captain Green.
John?
Madeline Evelley. I recognize you from all the photographs.
I'm Hank's mom.
it's so nice to meet you, ma'am. Hank was always talking about you.
this is PFc Rene Gagnon. - Pleasure to meet you, son.
thank you, sir. - Thanks for everything.
my pleasure. - Not at all.
IRA, I'd like you to meet Mrs. Strank, Mike's mom.
it's all right.
when I got the telegram, I...
I don't know what I'm trying to say here.
knowing he was with you that day and seeing him in that photograph...
...I don't know why it makes me feel better, but it does.
it's so silly, isn't it?
no, it's not.
how are you, son? Thank you very much.
we're the largest furniture wholesaler in Illinois.
thank you. Excuse me.
I'll make sure he calls.
well, thank you. Thank you. - Thank you.
are you Rene?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Franklin's mother.
it's an honor to meet you, ma'am.
I'm Pauline, Rene's girlfriend.
would you mind?
paper said that's Hank...
...and I honestly can't tell.
it's horrible of a mother not to know her own son, isn't it?
but that's him, isn't it?
well, to be honest, ma'am, it happened so quick...
...and with everything that was going on it's hard to remember who was where.
but...
...yeah, I think that's where he was.
that's Hank.
thank you.
excuse me.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
excuse us.
take him outside.
I'm Pauline. Nice to meet you.
he was the best Marine I ever knew.
thank you.
you okay, chief? - Christ.
I'm okay. - Yeah, you look it.
you're gonna screw this up, aren't you?
you're gonna screw it up for all of us.
I've got him.
get some sleep, Ira.
Mike? - Yeah?
do you see this? - What?
Mike? - Oh, shit, go!
he's killing me!
Hey, Doc, you think they got them all?
what? - Well, they're not shooting at us.
maybe we killed them all or they ran off in the night.
or they're waiting for us to start climbing.
third Platoon! Grab your gear, we're going up the hill.
just us? - Yeah, just us, lggy.
all right, Third Platoon, move!
I tag along?
Yeah, you can lead the way, if you want. Get a good shot of my face.
it's your ass I'm gonna make famous, Hank.
Hey, that'll work for me too.
lieutenant, if you make it to the top, put this up.
Yes, sir.
don't worry, lggy. They never shoot at the first patrol.
they don't? - No.
they want us to go up, signal that it's okay...
...then shoot everybody else as they come up the mountain.
Really? - Yeah.
unless, of course, they want to make an example of us and discourage all the others.
I think you're full of crap, you know that, Hank?
Really?
Jesus.
thank God that ain't us.
told you.
boots, spread them out and put them on a line.
set up a perimeter! First Squad!
Hank? Find me a pole. - Yeah.
right here.
let's put this flag up.
watch it.
right over here.
here, here. That's good. Right here, right here.
got that end? Hold that steady.
Lindberg.
Hey, who's got rope? - Right here.
give me something... Yeah, good. - That work?
do it, fellas.
keep it coming.
USMC! USMc!
shit, look! - Look at that!
Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!
jeez, look at that.
get down! Take cover!
cover with that. 30!
watch it! Twenty yards down, Hank!
you see them?
I got about 20 yards, left side.
lindberg, get the flamethrower!
boots, you see them? Cover right!
about 20 yards down! Duck one! - You see them?
keep the cover on!
second Squad, you see them?
get me some grenades!
I see them!
you see them?
right flank, over to the right!
cover me, I'm going down!
careful, lggy. Easy.
all clear!
okay, guys, who wants to be famous?
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.
goddamn it. Strank! - Sir?
they want a phone line run up to the top of the mountain.
let me guess, they picked us.
second Platoon, let's go. Get some exercise.
let's go. Get off your ass.
Oh, shit!
hope it still works, because you're not getting mine.
get Forrestal! - All right.
I don't know whose idea it was, Mr. Secretary.
well, it was goddamned brilliant.
I want that flag, Holland. Mark my words...
...raising that son of a bitch means a Marine corps for the next 500 years.
I want that flag.
Yes, sir. I'll make sure no one touches it.
you can count on me.
fuck that. That flag belongs to the men in this battalion.
that son of a bitch thinks our men died taking this ground...
...so we could hand our flag to some politician to pin to his wall?
he's out of his goddamn mind!
get me that flag and find another one to replace it.
you've gotta be shitting me. Gagnon!
get your ass over here.
Hey. - Hey.
Hey, fellas. - How you doing?
missed a beautiful shot, Joe.
it's that kind of day.
Hey, Mike. - Hell of a view, lieutenant.
lieutenant!
captain says he wants that flag.
he wants this flag?
Yes, sir.
we just put the damn thing up.
Yes, sir.
some kind of flag shortage?
he wants you to put this one up instead.
Hey, Mike.
do me a favor. You put this up, will you?
Yes, sir.
all right, let's find a pole.
take the flag down, boys. Captain's orders.
you heard him, let's do it.
there you go. - Lordy, she's a heavy one.
all right, hang on. Put this on.
one hell of a view.
good view from up here. Yes, I'd say so myself.
all right.
not in your way here, am I, Joe?
no, I'm fine, thanks.
Hey, Doc, you wanna give us a hand here?
Oh, Jesus, Bill, here she goes.
ready? Ready?
let's go.
did you get it?
I don't know. I wish I could've seen their faces.
nobody even noticed that second flag going up.
everybody saw that damn picture and made up their own story about it.
but your dad and the others knew what they had done and what they had not done.
all your friends dying...
...It's hard enough to be called a hero for saving somebody's life.
but for putting up a pole?
you gotta be kidding.
Hey! It took a lot of talented folks a long time to make that thing.
just wait till tonight, when it's lit properly, there's thousands of cheering people.
it's gonna look a lot better.
so stadium lights come down, spotlight comes up and you get your cue.
charge up this thing with the flag, plant it at the top.
you smile, you wave. You know the drill.
you want us to plant the flag on a pile of papier-mache.
Hey, that's show biz.
and try and stand how you stood the first time you planted it.
you know, pretend the other three guys are with you.
the dead guys.
Yeah, yeah.
okay, not a problem. - Good.
but where do we imagine Hank is standing?
sorry?
well, seeing that he wasn't there, it'll be kind of hard for us to leave a space for him.
Oh, I think you know exactly where he was.
you pointed him out to his mother.
this is bullshit.
I planted that damn thing once and I'm not doing it again.
Hayes. - For chrissake.
Hayes. Hayes, get your ass back here or you're going on report.
Hayes!
you wanna do your damn job?
let go of me! Let go of me!
come on! Come on!
he's with me! Hey, he's with me!
back off!
sir, he's with me, okay? He's with me.
IRA, put the goddamn chair down!
put the chair down, son! - Put the chair down, Ira!
tell them drop their sticks!
they're cops. They're supposed to have nightsticks.
you're not supposed to be swinging a chair.
calm down, son. - Sir, turn around, please.
that poster right there? The one on the end, that's him.
that's him?
Yes, sir. Do you read the papers?
Oh, christ.
we got another fucking hero. Get him out of here.
can you do that? - Yes, sir.
put the goddamn chair down. And let's go.
did you start this?
he didn't serve me!
I don't make the rules.
we don't serve Indians.
he needs to go sleep it off.
soldier Field.
you hear that?
what the hell is that?
I can't figure it out.
keep an eye out.
Hey, it sounds like it's coming from up there.
they're using grenades.
they're killing themselves.
IRA, let's go. Come on.
let's go, Ira. Come on.
thank God. Jesus. Look at you, chief.
you found him.
holy shit. You would have to pick today.
Vandegrift is here with enough brass to start a fucking band.
come on, let's go. Can you walk? - Yes, sir.
by yourself?
all right, look. I don't care if you have to carry him.
get him to the top, plant that flag, and don't fucking fall off.
get him in his stuff.
I'll stall these guys for as long as I can. Hurry up.
Jesus christ.
and now the heroes of Iwo Jima!
cover!
Harlon!
Harlon! Get your fire team up in that position!
O'Hare!
first Fire Team!
work around!
B. A.R. you, other side of the ridge!
covering fire, boys. Go, go, go!
Jackson, work your team around to the left!
cover!
left flank! Left flank!
Franklin, Gus, go check it out!
hustle up, boys!
we got them! - Clear!
one hell of an experience.
move out!
cease fire!
they're my men! You're targeting our men!
you're targeting our...
get me another radio!
sergeant? Sergeant!
Mike! Mike, Mike, Mike!
Mike? Mike!
here.
Hey, where's Doc?
corpsman!
Oh, shit.
how's his breathing? Harlon, move, buddy.
Hey, Mike. Mike, Mike, can you hear us?
it's okay. It's okay.
come on, Mike.
Mike? Mike, can you hear us?
Oh, Jesus.
all right, let's go! Move out!
I'm gonna get a stretcher. We need a hand over here.
let's take him down, move him off the beach.
ladies and gentlemen, the heroes of Iwo Jima!
corpsman!
Hank! Hank!
doc, they killed me.
Harlon!
Doc...they killed me.
come on, Harlon. Harlon, stay with me.
Franklin!
Franklin. - I'm fine, Ira.
corpsman!
Where'd he go? - Who?
the guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
where did he go?
I think you jumped in the wrong hole. - I didn't.
he was right here. Now, where the hell is he?
Lggy! Lggy!
shut up. You want every Jap on the island shooting at us?
Lggy!
does it open?
Lggy! Lggy!
lggy, are you down there?
Lggy!
can't tell who it is, but he's one of ours.
I had to go outside to throw up.
look what they did to the poor son of a bitch.
you okay, chief?
just let it go.
if that doesn't pry open their wallets, nothing will.
Jesus christ, he's drunk.
goddamn Indians.
come on, chief. Let's get you home.
that's not what I hear.
I called around, I'm not stupid.
he's been drunk since he started this damn tour, making a spectacle of himself.
just about choked that poor woman at the reception, blubbering.
Jesus christ, you're supposed to be watching these men.
Yes, sir.
he's making us look like regular asses.
with all due respect, sir, he never wanted to come on this trip.
we had to pull him, kicking and screaming, off that boat.
he wants to be with his unit.
what unit? They're all fucking dead.
this is how he honors those men, by drinking and throwing up and...?
you know what? He wants it? Great, we'll send him back.
get him packed and on a train today.
he's an embarrassment to the uniform.
Yes, sir.
I'll do it.
Yeah, no, that's, that's good. That's what I want.
I know it's a good thing, raising the money and that, because we need it.
but I can't take them calling me a hero.
all I did was try not to get shot.
some of the things I saw done, things I did...
...they weren't things to be proud of, you know?
Mike.
Mike was a hero.
you ever meet him?
no.
best Marine I ever met.
you know, chief,
I think if Mike was sitting here instead of you...
...He'd be saying the same thing about himself...
...not being a hero.
maybe. He was a good guy.
but I think that he would be ashamed of me...
...seeing me the way I am.
think I could see my ma before they ship me off?
think they'd do that? See my ma?
I'm sorry, Ira.
we got stories now to tell our kids, I guess.
keep your head down.
all aboard.
good luck, chief.
think I saw him once after that.
it was maybe six or seven years after the war.
I was working as a salesman, doing a lot of driving.
I was driving west across Texas.
I was trying to get where I was going so I could get home.
and I saw this guy hitchhiking on the side of the road.
and for a second, I thought it might've been him.
I'll always regret that I didn't stop, but I was in a hurry.
and he was an Indian.
we always told the press Ira insisted fight with his unit...
that he was going back to ...which was at least partially true...
...but that isn't what got the headlines.
we're engaged.
excuse me a minute, darling.
Hey, Doc? - Yeah?
got a minute?
Yeah. - I'll see you at the car.
you hear I'm getting married?
I did, Rene. That's great.
Yeah, it's something she wants. She waited for me all this time.
she's not used to all this, but she's a good girl.
I'm sure you'll be very happy.
so I was wondering if you'd be my best man.
me?
don't you have somebody at home, a buddy you'd rather ask?
well, I didn't really make many.
the ones who didn't go, it's, well, it's hard to even talk to them.
you know. - Yeah, I know.
I'd be proud to.
thank you.
I better go drag her away from them...
...before she announces I'm gonna be president of General Motors or something.
all right.
congratulations, honey. - Thank you so much. Thank you.
Rene, you're a lucky man.
here they are now. - Here they come.
grab a shot of them on the steps.
big smile, Mrs. Gagnon! - Say cheese.
I couldn't complain, because the press loved them...
...so they wrote more articles and people bought more bonds.
the tour went on with just Rene and your dad.
and the true heroes are the men who didn't make it home from lwo Jima...
...the men who died at lwo Jima and in other campaigns.
we ask that you honor the memory of those men by buying the war bonds and helping us to win this war.
thank you.
city after city, I thought the damn thing would never end.
and this rumor kept going around that the photograph had been staged.
your dad told them he wished he'd known he was having his picture taken...
...because he would've ducked the hell out of it.
was this your idea? Whose idea was it? Who wanted to stage the thing?
was there truth to the rumor that that picture was staged, Doc?
come on! Doc?
can you answer that?
I remember when your dad got shot. All hell was busting loose.
people back home saw that picture...
...and thought it was over when we took Suribachi.
we wished.
anyways, we're pinned down.
mortars, shells, machine guns.
fire coming from every which direction, right?
and we hear somebody call, "corpsman down.
corpsman down!
blood was spurting out of his throat and Doc was doing everything he could.
and the Corpsman looks up at him...
...and he knows what this means, shot in the neck.
he knows he's dying, you can see that.
but still, in his eyes...
...he's pleading with Doc to save his life.
and Doc can't.
you okay, Doc? - Yeah, I'm fine.
Yeah, you look fine. - I'm okay.
keep down, all right? I'm gonna go get a stretcher.
okay.
corpsman.
corpsman!
for God's sake, corpsman.
corpsman?
corpsman.
incoming!
let me see.
it's not that bad, you're gonna be okay. All right?
just stay with me. Look at me.
took us a half-hour to find your dad.
he could've bled to death.
coming down.
we got a chest wound. Put pressure on it.
Thanks.
vets will tell you about being hit but not wanting to leave their buddies.
usually, they're lying.
you'll take any excuse to get out of there.
but it happens.
you get the feeling you're letting them down.
I could see that in your dad's face.
Oh, he wanted to go.
he'd seen enough.
but he didn't want to leave us.
now, he was a hell of a good man, your dad.
Yeah.
while we were sitting there on the beach, we heard this great roar.
and we looked up...
that was the first of thousands of landings on Iwo.
look at that. - Yeah.
how about that.
I'm gonna head back, all right?
good luck.
that island saved a lot of lives.
a lot of lives.
I don't know what else to tell you.
after the bond tour, my dad finally got his operation.
by the time he got home, the war was over.
first thing he did was ask my mom to marry him.
like to thank you for having me here today.
it's an honor to be in front of such a strong people.
because of the war...
...white men will understand Indians a lot better.
and it's going to be a better world.
but life had other plans for him.
you're... You're him, aren't you?
you're the hero, right?
great. All right, kids, go get your picture taken.
Oh, that's great. That's great.
all right, now say cheese.
cheese. - Cheese.
that's great. Okay. Hey, thanks a lot. Thanks.
come on. - That's a hero, kids.
Hey, hero, lift this basket, will you?
it's too heavy for me.
rene tried to take advantage of those offers he'd received on the bond tour.
Yes, G-A-G-N-o-N.
right. Pronounced "Rene.
Rene, yes.
I actually called last week.
Yes. Okay, yes. Mr. Gagnon.
I gave Mr. Tennack your message.
I'm sure he'll call you.
okay.
all right...
...thank you.
but he was yesterday's hero.
he even applied for a job at the local police station.
they said he wasn't qualified.
after working the factory with Pauline he tried a few things...
...but spent the rest of his life as a janitor.
but Ira...
IRA. You got a visitor.
ira always made the news.
I could never find out why he did it, but one day Ira just took off.
he walked and hitched over 1300 miles...
...from Arizona to Texas.
he found Harlon Block's father working his field.
his wife, Belle, had left him soon after they discovered Harlon died.
she never forgave him for letting her son go off to war.
and Ira told him the truth.
that it had been his son who raised the flag with them...
...his son in the photograph.
and then he just turned and walked away.
though the flag-raising meant nothing to him...
...he somehow knew it would mean everything to them.
thanks for calling.
just as Belle knew all along.
the press soon found out...
...and called Hank's mom with the news that it wasn't her son after all.
the last time they all saw each other...
...was at the unveiling of the Marine Corps War Memorial.
and even though he'd planted the first flag above Iwo Jima...
...Hank's mother and father weren't invited.
IRA.
it's good to see you, Ira.
hell of a statue.
it wasn't long after that that they found Ira.
the papers said he died of exposure.
there was no autopsy.
it was about that same time when my father got in his car early one morning...
...telling my mom he had something to do.
he drove to a town on the other side of Wisconsin, where Iggy's mom lived.
ever since she heard the news about her son...
...she'd been trying to find out how he died, and no one would tell her.
I never found out what he told her...
...but I can pretty much guarantee it wasn't the truth.
my mother would ask him what was troubling him.
he would never say.
and every year, as it got close to Memorial Day...
...the reporters would start calling, asking to interview my father.
no, I'm sorry, he's fishing in canada.
we were always instructed to say the same thing.
okay.
Thanks.
when Mr. McCandless retired...
...my father bought the funeral home where he'd worked since coming home.
he spent the rest of his life running the business and raising his family.
he never spoke about the war or about the flag-raising.
never told us anything.
the first time I heard any of these stories was after he died.
where is he?
Oh, God.
he's not here, Dad.
he died.
who? Who died?
lggy.
Iggy.
Christ, poor lggy.
I hadn't thought of him for years.
how do you know about lggy?
you were calling for him.
when you collapsed.
I wasn't looking for lggy.
I was looking for you.
I wanted to...
I wanted to tell you, I'm... I'm sorry I wasn't a better father.
talked to you more.
I just...
I'm sorry.
sorry?
you were the best father a man could have.
did I ever tell you they took us swimming?
no, Dad.
after we planted the flag, we came down off the mountain...
...and they let us swim.
it was the funniest thing.
all this fighting and...
and we were jumping around in the water like kids.
that's the way I remember lggy now.
I finally came to the conclusion that maybe he was right.
maybe there's no such thing as heroes.
maybe there are just people like my dad.
I finally came to understand why they were so uncomfortable being called heroes.
heroes are something we create, something we need.
it's a way for us to understand what is almost incomprehensible...
...how people could sacrifice so much for us.
but for my dad and these men...
...the risks they took, the wounds they suffered...
...they did that for their buddies.
they may have fought for their country, but they died for their friends.
for the man in front, for the man beside them.
and if we wish to truly honor these men...
...we should remember them the way they really were...
...the way my dad remembered them.
come on, Doc!
someone, please! Please!
good morning. Los Angeles.
it's 7: 00. And it looks like it's gonna be another beautiful day.
we're looking at light clouds and highs in the mid 70s today.
keep that umbrella handy. Because we've got a chance of sprinkles later...
I hate you, too.
mm, babe, don't forget to look at the garage door.
it's acting up again.
already forgotten.
Bye.

Mmm, smells good.

Hey, Hector. Good morning.
Hey, Nicole.
I'm sorry I'm late.
don't worry.
Hey, Olivia's working the late shift at the hospital tonight.

Yeah, no problem. I've got studying to do anyway.

Hey, this is Bryce. You know what to do.
Bryce, it's Olivia.
you weren't around yesterday. You better have a damn good reason why.
okay, you call me immediately.
I'm worried about you.
my daughter Tracy was 1.65m, 118 pounds, But...
when the marines shipped Her body back from afghanistan...
sorry, her remains...

so.
Yeah. I took a drink that night.

Yeah, we're talking. - Oh, you're talking?
Really? Really, that's kinda weird Because she told olivia she never heard from you.

Charlie's asleep.
this is so wrong. - which is why you love it.
dude, as soon as we're done, You have to get your ass out of here.
all right, well, stop talking and get to work.
so then we get to the subject of the first dance, right?
I'm sorry, but Zoey picks one of the corniest songs of all time.
"islands in the stream." Yeah.
the old Kenny rogers/Dolly parton duet.
okay, and we used to sing it when we did karaoke,
but that was when we were, like, really, really drunk, you know?
and I put up with it because we were dating, And that's what you do.
but our friends are gonna be there, my family.
I cannot dance to "islands in the stream.
I will never live it down.
you don't care about any of this, do you?
Oh, I do. I do care. I'm riveted. I'm fascinated.
but, uh, what do you want me to say, don't marry her?
don't marry her. The odds are against you anyway
Oh, that's good. Thank you.
you're still married.
I'm surprised Olivia didn't leave me a long time ago.
me, too, buddy.
so what'd you guys dance to?
I can't even remember.
he's a holy terror.
terrible twos at one year.
you're lucky you have a girl.

son of a...
Roger.
there are thousands and thousands of injured people waiting for emergency...
uh, all we know for certain is that everyone on the planet.
seemed to have blacked out at exactly the same time.
confirming that the blackout was a worldwide phenomenon.
officials are...
is unknown. Fire services and police services are completely overwhelmed at this time.
my god.
it's the whole world. ...
fire services... And police services are completely overwhelmed...
Livy! Livy, I'm here.
Oh, thank god I got ahold of you.
what about charlie? Is she okay?
she's fine. Nicole called. She can stay put till one of us gets home.
and you're all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
we were in the middle of surgery and we all lost consciousness.
everyone. Patient died while we were out.
I'm downtown right now. Same thing.
so, uh, what? Everyone there blacked out?
Yeah, everyone.
we thought it was just the hospital, But then Corrie got a call from her mother in Chicago.
same thing happened there.
I know. It looks like this thing is global.
global? That's impossible.
Oh, I love you, but, baby, I gotta go.
all right, I love you.
what do you got?- Got an 8-year-old boy.
Pede versus car. Plowed straight through a fence at an elementary school.
head injury on the right, abdominal bruising on the left.
Dr. Benford! - Bryce, where the hell have you been?
go get into your scrubs. Meet me in E.R.
okay, let's get him into trauma.
you're gonna be okay, honey.
I know, Olivia.
how did you know my name?
what have we heard from Washington? We're the same.
everyone's just gathering intel.
CIA, homeland security.
our various legats offices overseas.
in other words, nobody knows anything.
how's he doing? - he's taking a turn for the worse.
I got no breath sounds on the left, Possible punctured lung.
he needs a left chest tube stat.
we don't release the pressure soon, it's gonna stop his heart from beating.
he's going south. Sats are dropping.
what the hell is this? Worldwide phenomenon.
near as we can tell.
people from all corners losing consciousness. At exactly the same moment.
and for the same duration-- 2 minutes, 17 seconds.
how is that even possible?
where the hell is that chest tube tray?
I need it now.
we got no pulse. Blood pressure's 40. - Thoracotomy.
what are we gonna do? - Come on, sweetie. Hang in there.
pulse ox 90. Pulse ox 80. - All right.
we're dropping! We're losing him! No pulse.
no pulse. Blood pressure's dropping.
so we've eliminated nuclear launches, E.M. P.S. And chemical agents.
what about natural phenomena then?
nasa's checking into more exotic explanations
solar flares, gamma bursts, that kind of thing.
but so far they've come up empty.
what about the vatican?
has the pope chimed in yet?
let's get this chest tube in.
SATs improving, B.P.'s normalizing.
Pleur-evac.
doing great, buddy.
doing real good.
okay, let's get him into the C.T. Scanner, Check out that head injury.
Bryce, you close him up. Nice job.
but don't think you're off the hook. I still wanna know where you were yesterday.
we need to wrap our heads around the scope of this thing.
it's now been four hours since the blackout.
you shut off the consciousness of the entire human race for two minutes.
what would the death toll be?
how many cars collided?
we have planes down at l. A.X.
how many more across the country?
around the world? f.A. A.'s reporting 877 aircraft down In the United States alone.
air force two was one of them.
the veep was on board.
okay. What about hospitals?
operations?
births that were in process.
people probably died walking up a flight of stairs.
global projections are pretty staggering.
what about the blackouts themselves, sir?
what about them?
well, we've been saying people have been blacking out, But...
that wasn't my experience.
for me, it was...
more like a dream, only more vivid than that.
one second, I was in a car.
the next... I was somewhere else.
Yeah, the same thing happened to me. - Me, too.
during the blackout, People seem to have experienced some kind of...
hallucination.
no. No, no.
except that mine didn't feel like a hallucination.
what's your point, Benford?
I didn't just lose consciousness.
it felt more like my... Consciousness went somewhere else.
like I was having a memory, Only it wasn't of the past.
it was of the future.
I was in my office.
it was night.
it was 10: 00 on the hour.
I was looking out into the atrium, And I happened to see the date.
april 29, 2010, About half a year from now.
hold on.
april 29th?
I saw the same date. It was on the news.
same for me-- April 29th, 10: 00 p. M.
so you're saying what, Everyone's consciousness just jumped forward six months to April 29th?
crazy as that sounds, yeah.
sit down. Sit down.
J. T.could you, uh, give me a hand? Thanks.
we didn't do this.
even if you didn't, You were still planning on killing thousands of people.
so stay still and shut up.
you get ahold of Zoey?
Yeah, she's all right. - Mark, hey.
you got a sec? - Sure.
I think there may be a way to corroborate What we were talking about in there.
what do you mean?
well, in my...Flash-forward, It was April 30th, 6:00 A.M. but I was in london, Which is eight hours ahead of the west coast, So it makes sense.
Wait,"flash-forward"? What are we talking about?
I'll explain later. Tell me what you saw.
I was having a meeting with our liaison at new scotland yard.
I remember we were interrupted because this bird just crashed into the window.
the point is, I had a vision of Fiona Banks.
let's see if she had a vision of me.
inspector banks.
Fiona, this is al gough, FBI.
I'm here with my colleagues in l. A.
my god.
uh, I know why you're calling.
you want to know what I saw.
we all do.
okay. We were sitting in my office.
what was the date?
april 30th.
what time?
uh, I don't know.
uh, 6:00 in the morning. Don't ask me why it was so early.
something to do with the Rutherford case.
Yes! Yes, and something interrupted us.
uh, uh, a bird. It flew at the window. It broke its neck.
so our visions were the same.
when the worldwide blackout occurred earlier today,
people were undergoing brain scans. At that exact moment.
so like m. R.I.S or P.E.T. Scans? That kind of thing?
exactly. And in each of these cases, The hippocampus.
that's the memory center of the brain--was actively engaged
for the entire 2 minutes and 17 seconds.
these thought patterns are consistent With a waking experience.
people were not asleep. They were not dreaming.
so then what is it that they were experiencing?
well, by all appearances, Uh, memories of events that haven't occurred yet.
so everyone saw the future.
but did they see the same future?
I mean, are these accounts consistent?
well, they certainly seem to be.
hundreds of thousands of people were watching news broadcasts,
reading newspapers, and their details seem to be the same.
senator glenway will be facing ethics charges.
the dow will be on an upswing.
there'll be food riots in ghana, and the list goes on.
a remarkably concise series of events.
are starting to come together from that day.
it's like a grand mosaic is being filled in. Everyone on earth...
mosaic.
that was the name of the investigation I was working on in my vision.
it had to do with what caused all this.
so did you see anything in your vision that was helpful?
photographs, names, people of interest.
if this really was the future we all saw,
then I guess maybe they will be leads.
but none of them make any sense to me right now.
anything else? - No. No, that was it.
what about you? What did you see?
nothing.
I, uh, I blacked out like everybody else and woke up on the road.
what about our, uh, person of interest? Do we think she's involved?
she's a dead end, if you ask me, And clueless as the rest of us.
well, circle back on it anyway. We're grasping at straws at this point.
Janis, you wanna share what you saw?
Yeah, I was... Getting a prenatal sonogram.
the baby was about 17 weeks, And it was a little girl.
it was totally bizarre.
but I'm obviously not pregnant.
I don't even have a boyfriend.
what about you, sir?
I... Was in a meeting.
a meeting...
and I happened to glance down at the paper. Sports page.
the rays rallied from 3 runs down to sweep the sox at fenway.
and there was another story.
kobe bryant tore his ligament in his knee.
out for the season.
you know what? We should start writing these stories down.
I mean, the "post" has a circulation of what. A million?
a million, yeah.
how many other people were reading it then, too? We gotta start comparing stories.
Yeah, it's not just the "post." it's all the other news outlets.
7 billion people caught a glimpse of the future.
maybe just one of them knows why this happened.
how do we compare 7 billion stories?
you create a web site. right.
people can log on and post what they saw And cross-reference their visions.
we can piggyback on that and search for patterns.
I think that's what I was already doing.
what do you mean? - Mosaic.
all those leads I was running down.
we should start following up on them now.
assuming your vision is even accurate, This investigation doesn't exist yet.
but it could. It will.
in my flash-forward, I was investigating what caused all this.
I seemed to have an idea why all of this was happening.
and those people, the places I saw on the board
they were part of this puzzle-- mosaic.
look, I'm certain of it.
fine. We'll set up an interagency task force.
and as far as this office is concerned, You three, you own this.
this is kind of insane.
I mean, we're running point on this Because he had a vision of us running point on this?
what, you find that funny?
we don't even know - we don't know if - come on.
we don't have anything right now. - It works for me!
it works for me!
the whole world's on pins and needles, people.
air traffic's been grounded.
people scared to leave their homes, walk across the street.
hell, we've got martial law across half this country.
priority number one - finding out what caused this.
priority number two is figuring out whether or not It'll happen again.
you got it?
Yes, sir.
good. I'm out.
okay, my psychic friend, What do you got?
I remember a name-- D. Gibbons.
that's right. Yeah.
what else you got?
there was a photograph here of a doll.
the doll was burned. The head was melted. There was a bullet casing nearby.
something about baltimore.
a hand. Baltimore...
no. No, no, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
a... A "blue hand." That's what it said.
what the hell does that mean?
I have no idea. Just put it up.
no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Here, in the center.
this is gonna sound stupid. But I was wearing one of those, uh...
friendship bracelets. You know, like kids make.
Yeah.
okay, that's good. What else? What else?
that's it. Those are all the leads I can remember.
what about your state of mind? What were you doing?
I was...
chambering a round. I was scared to death.
you were scared to death in here?
the office was empty, but.
someone was coming for me.
they were wearing masks.
they wanted to kill me because of what I knew.
one of 'em had a... Tattoo.
how many D.Gibbons do you think there are in the world?
maybe thousands. - Have janis compile a list.
not a hell of a lot to go on yet.
at least you remember something.
what do you mean?
everybody saw something.
everybody had some kind of a vision.
I didn't see a damn thing, Mark.
maybe it means you'll be sleeping six months from now.
if I was sleeping, why wasn't I dreaming?
look, I never remember my dreams.
stop, all right?
we're both thinking the same thing, So let's just say it.
what if I didn't see anything Because six months from now...
I'm gonna be dead?
Mr. Benford?
are you all right?
Yeah. How's charlie?
she's fine. She's sleeping.
I was watching the news all day.
they say it happened everywhere.
it's gonna be okay.
is that what they're saying at the FBI? Do you have inside information?
I wish we did.
so then you don't know it's gonna be okay.
I think god did this.
Why?
to punish us.
still no luck finding his parents?
well, his mother died on the 405.
father's name is Lloyd Simcoe.
he works at stanford.
but, uh, no one's been able to locate him yet.
so even if the kid pulls through, He could still wind up an orphan.
Hey, you saved his life today.
you chalk that up as a victory.
Yeah, I'm trying, but after a day like today...
what about you?
how are you staying so zen through all this?
who says I am?
you wanna know why I wasn't at work yesterday?
I've been going through Some really heavy things recently.
I don't want to get into it now.
but the point is, This morning, I was out on the venice pier, And.
and I was thinking about committing suicide.
Oh, my god!
it's okay. I'm okay.
I saw a glimpse of my future, And I was alive.
you know, and everything's changed for me now.
whatever I was thinking about doing Obviously wasn't meant to happen.
it like a sign from god or something.
you know, these visions were a gift.
don't you think?
a gift? I don't know.
not for me.
Why? What did you see?
I saw the end of my marriage.
I was drinking again, In my flash-forward.
and in my head, I...
I know it wasn't just a one-time thing.
I was full-fledged drinking again.
all the anxiety, Shame.
it was all back.
just because you saw that doesn't mean it's gonna happen.
even if th future stuff is real,
maybe it's a blessing in disguise. Maybe because you saw it, you can change it.
ghost of christmas future crap.
what if I can't?
people relapse. I did. You pick yourself up again.
Olivia said she'd-- she'd leave me if I slip again.
she made that clear.
then don't slip.
until you see something that corroborates these visions, It all fantasy.
the future is still up in the air.
you're a terrible sponsor. You know that?
what do you want me to say, Mark?
you're not the only one this-- this has happened to you know?
I've got the opposite problem.
what do you mean?
Tracy was killed in afghanistan.
and you were at the funeral, right?
right.
but in my flash-forward,
she's alive.
doesn't make any sense. They I. D.'d her remains.
I know.
I can't explain it, but...
it was her.
I'm--I'm certain of it.
and if she's out there somewhere, she needs me.
for two years, I've-- I've been putting her to rest.
now... I don't know what to think.
I'm confused.
I'm... Hopeful.
and I'm angry that I'm hopeful.
you're worried...
your future's gonna come true.
I'm worried mine won't.
you fixed the garage door.
it was a slow day.
do you remember our song?
the one we danced to at our wedding.
Etta james."at last."
right.
what did you see?
I was at the office. Working on a case.
it wa this. - What caused the flash-forwards.
I got the sense I was in danger.
then. Then it ended.
nothing else?
no, that was it.
what about you?
babe?
I don't want to talk about it.
Why?
cause it was too upsetting.
I need to hear it, whatever it was.
no.
no, you don't.
come on. What did you see?
you know what? Just... Let it go.
Olivia, what did you see?
I was with another man.
who?
I don't know.
I've never seen him before.
he was downstairs.
I don't know who he was, And yet my vision
I had all these intense... feelings for him.
I... "hey, honey."
I don't understand, mark.
I would never cheat on you.
I wouldn't betray you.
I wouldn't.
just because we saw these things doesn't mean they're gonna happen.
uh, I'm sorry. You are...
his father Lloyd Simcoe.
how is he? - He'll be fine.
his attending physician, Dr. Benford. Will be here in the morning.
she can fill you in on some of the details.
then I'll wait for her.
daddy?
what are you doing up, sweetie?
it's after midnight.
I had a bad dream.
come here.
you wanna talk about it?
why was mommy crying?
Oh, she was just scared.
it's gonna be okay.
are you scared?
no, honey. I'm fine.
what do you have there? What do you got in your hand? Hmm?
something I made for you.
I want you to have it.
take it, daddy.
do you want me to help you put it on?
sure. - Okay.
I'm still at work, babe.
mm, they got us working late.
Yeah, I'm watching it right now.
if, uh, this is the song you want, You got it, baby.
let's, um, let's talk about the future when you get home.
dem, come here. You have to see this.
gotta go.
I love you, too.
what's up?
okay, so as far as we know,
every single person on the entire planet lost consciousness at the exact same period of time, right?
right.
okay, so I started cycling through a bunch of surveillance cameras for the last five hours...
because I was curious to see what they recorded.
I looked at hundreds of them.
I checked every major city, even web cams in other countries...
and they all show the exact same thing.
at 11: 00 A.M.people start dropping like flies.
okay, and then 2 minutes and 17 seconds later, They start to come to.
and then I saw this.
this was in Detroit.
what am I looking at here?
just hang on a second.
right there. Look right there.
no way. - Yeah.
who the hell is that?
and why are they awake?
a SQUID, I THINK.
since WHEN DO SQUID HAVE WINGS?
okay, MISS ACCURACY, IT IS A BIRD WITH TENTACLES. HAPPY NOW?
no, YOU'RE RIGHT. SQUID WITH WINGS.
can WE SKIP THE SEMANTICS? ALL THAT MATTERS IS THAT IT'S FROM MONGO,
it SHOULDN'T BE HERE, AND NEITHER SHOULD THOSE.
okay, ZARKOV, HIT ME, WHAT'S THE BAD NEWS?
I THINK THESE RANDOM RIFTS ARE LIKE AFTERSHOCKS FROM ALL THE PREVIOUS RIFTS,
and EVERY NEW RIFT WEAKENS THE DIMENSIONAL FABRIC EVEN MORE.
okay, SO THAT'S THE BAD NEWS?
Yes. BUT THE REAL BAD NEWS IS THAT EVENTUALLY THE WHOLE THING'S GOING TO BURST,
destroying ALL SPACE, TIME, AND DIMENSION.
that's IT, I'M DONE RECYCLING.
so, IS THERE ANY GOOD NEWS IN THERE? SOMEWHERE?
the GOOD NEWS IS, THE OLD BAD NEWS, WHICH WAS MING,
isn't AS BAD AS THE NEW BAD NEWS, WHICH IS THAT WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE.
this IS EXACTLY WHAT RANKOL AND I PREDICTED WOULD HAPPEN.
okay, I'M SORRY, DID I MISS SOMETHING? WHEN DID WE START TRUSTING RANKOL?
I KNOW, I KNOW, YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH RANKOL WAS DIFFERENT THAN MINE.
no, NO, NO, NO. HAM AND BALONEY ARE DIFFERENT. I GOT TORTURED.
if RANDOM OBJECTS FROM MONGO ARE APPEARING ON EARTH,
wouldn't OBJECTS FROM EARTH POP UP ON MONGO?
well? IF IT'S NOT A WEAPON, WHAT IS IT?
I BELIEVE IT'S A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT OF SOME KIND.
as FOR THE OTHERS...
no DOUBT AN ACQUIRED TASTE ON EARTH.
but THESE OBJECTS POSE NO THREAT.
who SENT THEM?
someone ON EARTH MUST HAVE DEVELOPED A RIFT GENERATOR.
I'm AFRAID THE SITUATION IS FAR WORSE.
the VERY FABRIC BETWEEN OUR WORLDS IS BECOMING UNSTABLE.
hence, THESE SPONTANEOUS RIFTS.
if THEY'RE NOT STABILIZED BY THE TIME THE AQUEDUCT IS COMPLETE,
our ENTIRE PLAN FOR EARTH'S WATER WILL FAIL.
so THE TUNNELING PROJECT IS PROCEEDING ON COURSE?
Yes, AND ON SCHEDULE.
when THE WATER COMES, WE WILL BE READY.
but WITHOUT A DEPENDABLE RIFT...
you SOLVE THIS, RANKOL,
and YOU WILL BE THE SAVIOR OF OUR WORLD.
but FAIL...
well... OH, I WOULD HATE TO THINK.
Ah, IT IS A DIGLISH.
on MONGO, THE TURIN KEEP THEM AS PETS.
so IT'S NOT DANGEROUS?
only DURING MATING SEASON, OF COURSE.
mating SEASON?
I WOULD NOT FALL ASLEEP, IF I WERE YOU.
this IS BAD!
a WHOLE CLUSTER OF RIFTS AT THE KOZY KORNER MOTEL.
isn't THAT NEAR WHERE WE FOUND THE SQUID THING?
DIGLISH. THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE.
if THESE RANDOM RIFTS ARE THE RESULT OF DAMAGE FROM ALL THE PREVIOUS RIFTS,
then THIS MOTEL MUST BE THE POINT OF INTERSECTION...
like RIPPLES COLLIDING ON A POND.
only INSTEAD OF DYING OUT, THE RIPPLES BECOME MORE FREQUENT.
and IT KEEPS OPENING UP IN THE SAME PLACE.
exactly. WHOA...
the MOTEL IS LIKE RIFT CENTRAL.
well, I KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING.
now... DON'T YOU GO ANYWHERE.
I LIKE YOU JUST THE WAY YOU ARE.
in A MINUTE, YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE ME EVEN BETTER.
hope SO.
seems QUIET ENOUGH.
what ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING FOR?
uh, BEATS ME. THINGS FROM MONGO USUALLY HAVE A WAY OF STANDING OUT, THOUGH.
I STAND OUT?
Oh, NO. NOT AT ALL. YOU FIT RIGHT IN.
but THAT DOESN'T.
this LOOK FAMILIAR TO ANYONE?
of COURSE. IT IS A VERDEN WALKING STAFF.
not EXACTLY A FASHION STATEMENT ON THIS PLANET.
I WILL SURVEY THE PERIMETERS.
it's ONLY A BOOT.
well, THE MAID SERVICE SUCKS.
either THAT, OR SOMETHING REALLY BIG CAME THROUGH HERE.
like A TORNADO.
well, WHATEVER IT WAS, IT'S GONE NOW.
isn't IT?
stay HERE.
be CAREFUL.
what IS IT?
Oh, WE'RE GOOD. ALL CLEAR.
well, THE ONLY SCARY THING SO FAR IN THIS ROOM IS THIS...
cowboy SHIRT.
uh, ACTUALLY...
this, UH...
that's A GOOD COLOR FOR YOU.
my.
Yeah, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK, UH...
we've GOT THE SERIOUS MAKINGS OF A PARTY HERE.
one OF YOUR GUESTS REPORTED HEARING SCREAMS COMING FROM ROOM 12.
so WHAT'S YOUR POINT?
I MEAN, SOME OF OUR PARTIES CAN GET PRETTY CRAZY.
we're TALKING ABOUT PRIVATE PARTIES HERE?
we PREFER THE TERM "DISCREET CLIENTELE.
Uh-huh.
my POINT IS, IF I WERE TO GO RUNNING EVERY TIME I HEAR A STRANGE SOUND...
well, YOU GET MY DRIFT.
so YOU DIDN'T CHECK TO SEE IF ANYONE WAS HURT?
do I LOOK LIKE HOMELAND SECURITY TO YOU?
okay, SIR, I'LL CHECK OUT THE ROOM.
hopefully THOSE SCREAMS YOU HEARD WILL JUST TURN OUT TO BE CRIES OF PASSION.
so.
this IS THE BIG STORY YOU HAD TO COVER.
this IS WHY YOU COULDN'T SEE ME TODAY, OR LAST WEEK.
why YOU'VE BEEN LYING TO ME ALL THIS TIME...
you AND HIM. IN A DUMP LIKE THIS.
it's NOT WHAT YOU THINK.
really, REALLY, REALLY NOT WHAT YOU THINK.
just HOW STUPID DO YOU THINK I AM?
look, THERE'S A PERFECTLY GOOD EXPLANATION FOR ALL OF THIS, JOE.
so EXPLAIN IT.
I CAN'T.
I'm REALLY SORRY, JOE, BUT I CAN'T.
that's WHAT I THOUGHT.
Joe-- - JOE, PLEASE, YOU GOT TO TRUST ME.
what YOU TOUCHING ME FOR, BUDDY, HUH?
today IS NOT THE DAY! - LOOK OUT!
what THE HELL JUST HAPPENED?
that... WOULD BE A RIFT.
and WE JUST FELL THROUGH IT.
where ARE WE?
this... THIS IS, UH...
this IS THE PLANET MONGO.
another PLANET? NO WAY.
way.
this... IS...
insane.
it's A LITTLE CRAZY, BUT YOU'LL GET USED TO IT.
what?
you JUST TOLD ME THAT WE'RE NOT ON EARTH ANYMORE.
it MIGHT TAKE ME A LITTLE WHILE TO GET USED TO IT.
Yeah, OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M SORRY, I FORGOT
how WEIRD IT WAS FOR DALE AND I THE FIRST TIME WE GOT HERE.
you BROUGHT DALE HERE?
no. NOT EXACTLY.
it WAS AN ACCIDENT.
I'm LISTENING!
okay, WELL, THERE WAS A RIFT LIKE THAT ONE,
and I WAS GOING TO GO THROUGH IT TO TRY AND FIND MY DAD,
and DALE TRIED TO STOP ME,
only IT DIDN'T QUITE WORK OUT LIKE THAT.
this IS INSANITY!
you DON'T KNOW WHAT'S OVER THERE, IF YOU CAN COME BACK.
Dale, I HAVE TO DO THIS.
I DON'T CARE.
Hey.
Hey!
you SEE, JOE, THAT'S IT. THERE'S NO AFFAIR, OKAY?
this IS IT, THIS IS THE WHOLE SECRET.
it's MONGO.
the BIGGEST SECRET IN HISTORY! AND YOU KEPT IT FROM ME?
look, WE COULDN'T TELL YOU, ALL RIGHT?
the MORE PEOPLE THAT KNOW, THE MORE DANGEROUS IT WAS FOR EVERYONE!
well, THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE KEPT IT AWAY FROM DALE!
well, I TRIED, ALL RIGHT? BUT THIS IS DALE WERE TALKING ABOUT!
I MEAN, ONCE SHE GETS HER MIND SET ON SOMETHING... WHAT WAS I GOING TO DO?
we're TALKING ABOUT MY FIANCEE.
I WOULD HAVE PROTECTED HER.
Dale DOESN'T NEED PROTECTION, ALL RIGHT?
she's A LOT STRONGER THAN YOU MAY THINK.
what HAPPENED TO YOU?
I HAD A MING MAKEOVER.
I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE TONIGHT'S ENTERTAINMENT.
fortunately, I FOUND A STAND-IN.
I WAS JUST COMING TO RESCUE YOU.
no, NO, I WAS COMING TO RESCUE YOU.
are YOU KIDDING ME?
you NOT ONLY PUT HER LIFE IN DANGER, SHE ALMOST GOT
Yeah, BUT SHE DIDN'T! ALL RIGHT? ALL RIGHT?
she ESCAPED, SO... WE'RE ALL GOOD.
okay.
I GUESS YOU DESERVE ONE FREE PUNCH. NOW, CAN WE MOVE ON?
okay, YOU KNOW WHAT? NOW, THAT'S ONE PUNCH TOO MANY.
keep COUNTING.
all RIGHT, NOW, CAN WE JUST... CALM DOWN?
Hey! NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO! NO!
through A RIFT? BOTH OF THEM?
how COULD THIS HAPPEN?
but, MORE IMPORTANTLY, HOW DO THEY GET BACK?
they DON'T HAVE A RIFT BLASTER.
you DON'T NEED ONE WITH THESE RIPPLES. THEY OPEN ON THEIR OWN,
so MAYBE JOE AND FLASH CAN CATCH ANOTHER ONE BACK.
provided THEY STAY ALIVE THAT LONG.
if THEY'RE IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME.
I FEEL LIKE THIS IS MY FAULT.
but WHO KNEW THOSE TWO WOULD FIGHT OVER ME?
I DID.
me TOO.
Really? YOU SAW THIS COMING?
from, LIKE, A MILE AWAY.
all RIGHT. SO WHAT NOW?
now, I GET TO WORK.
what THE HECK?
that's LIKE HITTING A BRICK WALL!
Ah! BULLET-PROOF VEST. STANDARD ISSUE.
okay, THAT IS SO NOT PLAYING FAIR.
give UP?
Oh, GOD, I'M TOO TIRED TO GIVE UP.
why DON'T WE CONSIDER... QUITTING?
suits ME FINE, PAL,'CAUSE I'M THROUGH WITH YOU.
Oh, NO, YOU CAN'T DO THAT, ALL RIGHT? THIS ISN'T MARYLAND, THIS IS MONGO.
you CAN'T JUST GO WALKING OFF.
who DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING?
more VOLUNTEERS FOR THE TUNNELS.
this HAS BEEN A GOOD DAY'S HUNTING.
next TIME YOU WANT TO GO RUNNING OFF, TRY CHECKING WITH ME FIRST.
maybe NEXT TIME YOU'LL TELL ME WHAT'S OUT THERE.
we're IN BIG TROUBLE HERE, IN CASE YOU DIDN'T GET THAT PART.
yeah? WITH WHO? WHO'S THE LAW AROUND HERE?
I'm THE ONLY LAW HERE.
remember THAT, IF YOU WANT TO STAY ALIVE.
strange WEAPON. WON'T NEED THIS WHERE YOU'RE GOING.
up YOU GET. TAKE THEM TO THE TUNNELS.
told YOU, CHECK WITH ME FIRST.
something FROM MONGO WAS DEFINITELY HERE.
and IT LOOKS LIKE IT WENT THAT WAY.
monster! MONSTER!
are YOU OKAY?
No! WOULD YOU BE OKAY IF YOU SAW A MONSTER?
what KIND OF MONSTER?
big MONSTER!
did YOU SEE WHERE IT WENT?
No! AND YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.
you GO CATCH IT. THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GOOD AT.
you're GOOD AT THAT.
I've GOT ENOUGH DIMENSIONAL FREQUENCY READINGS TO WORK ON THE RIFT PROBLEM.
that's WHAT I'M GOOD AT.
so, UH... YOU JUST GO AHEAD.
I'm GOING TO GO BACK TO THE LAB.
if THERE'S ANYTHING YOU NEED, I'LL BE BACK THERE...
not CATCHING ANYTHING!
this IS BAD.
what, THERE REALLY IS A MONSTER?
worse.
a DEVIATE.
can't BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT LETS THIS HAPPEN.
the GOVERNMENT MAKES IT HAPPEN.
number-one RULE ON MONGO-- AVOID ANYONE IN A UNIFORM.
rule NUMBER TWO? DON'T BREAK RULE NUMBER ONE.
they CAN'T ALL BE BAD.
what ABOUT ASKING TO SEE THE HEAD GUY?
okay, THAT WOULD BE MING, AND THAT'D BE A SERIOUSLY BAD IDEA, TRUST ME.
coming FROM THE GUY WHO COULDN'T TRUST ME?
believe ME, YOU WANT TO AVOID BEING ON A FIRST-NAME BASIS
with ANY OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES.
I LEARNED THAT ONE THE HARD WAY.
where IS THE IMEX?
what's AN IMEX?
Oh, WELL. I DID TRY.
what DID YOU DO TO PROVOKE HIM?
nothing. I JUST HAD SOMETHING HE WANTED.
come ON, THERE HAD TO BE MORE THAN THAT.
it TAKES A VERY SPECIAL TALENT TO RUN INTO HOMICIDAL ALIENS.
Yeah, WELL, YOU SHOULD KNOW.
you're SAYING ALIENS HAVE COME TO EARTH?
Hi. I'M LILLIAN.
that's NOT POSSIBLE.
Yeah, BUT NEITHER IS MONGO, AND HERE WE ARE, RIGHT?
remember THE BLACKOUT? THE TIME THAT YOU COULDN'T ACCOUNT FOR?
right AFTER I MET LILLIAN.
wait, YOU'RE SAYING SHE WAS AN ALIEN?
ask DALE. SHE WAS THERE WITH YOU. SHE SAW IT ALL.
Joe? OH, MY GOD.
Hey.
everything's OKAY, BABE.
if IT WASN'T FOR US, YOU'D BE THE WORLD'S OLDEST DETECTIVE.
I ALMOST GET ZEROED OUT BY AN ALIEN VAMPIRE,
and DALE DIDN'T TELL ME?
what AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY?
a HOW BOUT THANK YOU?
after ALL, IF IT WASN'T FOR DALE...
she CAME THROUGH FOR BOTH OF US.
wait. DALE SAVED YOU TOO?
ming FORCED ME TO DUEL. I WAS DRUGGED,
but SHE Y TO TURN IT AROUND.
talk TO BARIN. TELL HIM WHAT'S GOING ON.
I'm GOING TO TRY TO GET TO FLASH.
flash.
I JUST CAME TO WISH YOU LUCK.
she HAD A CLEVER WAY OF GETTING ME THE ANTIDOTE TO SAVE MY LIFE.
you KNOW, DALE AND THAT MOUTH OF HERS, SHE HAS A WAY OF GETTING THROUGH TO PEOPLE.
if IT WASN'T FOR HER, I'D BE DEAD.
at COULD STILL HAPPEN.
chain THEM TO THE OTHER VOLUNTEERS.
who DO WE HAVE TO TALK TO TO GET OUT OF HERE?
there's ONLY ONE WAY OUT. WANT TO TAKE IT?
no, NO, NO. HE'S FINE. HE'S NEW IN TOWN. HE DIDN'T GET THE MEMO.
oth OF YOU.
or YOU'LL WISH I KILLED YOU RIGHT HERE.
I CAN SPEAK FOR MYSELF.
Yeah, CLEARLY. NO NEED TO THANK ME.
Hey, DACTYL. WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?
the BLACK DUST.
everyone WHO MINES THE BLACK ROCKS
I WILL. YOU WILL TOO.
wait AND SEE.
t's LIKE HALLOWEEN.
where DO ALL THESE PEOPLE COME FROM?
all OVER MONGO. MING'S WHAT YOU'D CALL AN EQUAL-OPPORTUNITY DICTATOR.
that's A VERDEN. USUALLY FRIENDLY.
OMADRIAN. USUALLY NOT.
are YOU FRIENDS WITH ALL THE TRIBES ON THIS PLANET?
I DON'T THINK "FRIENDS" IS EXACTLY THE RIGHT WORD.
bring THE TOOLS OF TRANSFORMATION!
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T ALLOW MEN HERE.
these HAVE BEEN TRANSFORMED.
transformed?
their AGGRESSIONS HAVE BEEN REMOVED.
see HOW PEACEFUL THEY ARE?
look, I JUST CAME HERE FOR SOME MEDICINE!
my FRIEND, HE WAS BITTEN BY A JOY-BUG.
so, LUCKILY, I WAS ABLE TO AVOID A CLOSE ENCOUNTER OF THE PAINFUL KIND.
what ARE THESE TUNNELS FOR?
they SAY MING HAS FOUND NEW SOURCE-WATER,
but NO ONE HAS SEEN IT.
then WHY SO MANY WORKERS?
those IN THE BLACK TUNNELS DIE FAST.
here...
...it TAKES A LITTLE LONGER.
this JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER.
What'd YOU GET US INTO, FLASH?
flash?
you're FLASH GORDON?
Yeah.
this GUY KNOWS YOU?
I SPENT SOME TIME WITH THE DACTYLS. THEY'RE A TRIBE OF FLYING MEN.
I AM DAREM.
I HAVE HEARD THE STORIES OF HOW YOU HELPED OUR LEADER, VULTAN, FIND HIS SON.
the KID WHOSE FRIENDS SAID HE WAS KIDNAPPED BY BIRD MEN.
you're TELLING ME THAT WAS REAL?
you LISTEN TO ME!
I AM VULTAN OF THE DACTYLS, AND YOU ARE MY SON,
and I TELL YOU NOW, YOU CAN DO THIS!
you HAVE STRENGTH THAT OTHERS CAN ONLY DREAM OF.
okay.
we JUMP TOGETHER! NOW!
you SEE, JOE, YOU ALREADY MET A DACTYL.
he JUST HADN'T LEARNED TO FLY YET.
you're HERE TO WORK, NOT TELL STORIES.
stay WELL, DAREM, SO I CAN HAVE THE PLEASURE OF KILLING YOU MYSELF.
okay, EASY. EASY.
what THE HELL DID YOU DO THAT FOR?
all DACTYLS OWE A DEBT OF HONOR TO FLASH GORDON.
besides... ANGERING STRAKE IS THE LAST PLEASURE I HAVE LEFT.
thank YOU, DAREM.
you MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING RIGHT. NOT EVERYONE AROUND HERE HATES YOU.
Thanks.
I THINK.
you'll CLEAR 20 LOADS OF ROCK BY MOONRISE...
or BE SENT TO DIG OUT THE BLACK TUNNELS.
easy THERE, BIG GUY, ALL RIGHT? YOU JUST NEED TO CATCH YOUR BREATH.
no, HE'S RIGHT.
I CAN'T MAKE 20 LOADS.
STRAKE HAS WON.
grant ME A FAVOR, FLASH GORDON?
anything. NAME IT.
when I DIE,
take MY CREST.
sow THE FEATHERS ON THE WIND, SO THAT MY BROTHERS WILL KNOW THAT I'M GONE.
of COURSE.
but NOBODY'S GOING TO DIE HERE TODAY.
he's RIGHT.
we'll FILL YOUR QUOTA.
the DEVIATES WERE PEOPLE ONCE,
but THAT WAS BEFORE THEY DRANK THE GRAY WATER.
gray WATER?
it's TOXIC. CLEAR TO THE EYE, BUT UNHEALTHFUL.
then WHY WOULD THEY DRINK IT?
no ONE KNEW UNTIL THE MUTATIONS APPEARED.
then EVERY GENERATION WAS WORSE THAN THE LAST.
they BECAME ANIMALS, DEFORMED IN BODY AND MIND.
but NOW THAT PEOPLE KNOW...
I SEE YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN THIRSTY...
truly THIRSTY.
your THROAT TURNS TO CLAY.
you CRAVE WATER MORE THAN AIR ITSELF.
so THEY DRINK THE GRAY WATER, KNOWING...
knowing THEY WILL LIVE AND THEIR CHILDREN WILL LIVE.
it IS A SACRIFICE THEY CHOOSE.
but FLASH AND I, WE MET A DEVIATE ON MONGO.
he DIDN'T HURT US.
well, YOU WERE LUCKY.
I HAVE SEEN THEM TEAR A MAN IN HALF.
this IS HANS ZARKOV...
recording MY ATTEMPT TO SAVE THE WORLD FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS.
the RIFTS HAVE ENTERED A NEW AND VOLATILE STATE.
each RIFT IS NOW GENERATING MORE RIFTS AT AN EXPONENTIAL RATE.
if WE EXTRAPOLATE THE PATTERN FREQUENCY,
and THE PROCESS IS NOT STOPPED, THEN THE LIKELY OUTCOME...
total COLLAPSE OF THE INTERDIMENSIONAL FABRIC.
it WILL BE LIKE CHERNOBYL ON A COSMIC SCALE.
great...
I'm SHARING THE FATE OF THE UNIVERSE WITH A PIECE OF FLYING SUSHI.
wait!
believe ME... DEATH IS THE ONLY CURE FOR THIS CURSE.
it's AFRAID OF US. - IT SHOULD BE.
but IT'S NOT ATTACKING.
that's ICE! IT JUST WANTS THE WATER.
wait! - WHAT NOW?
it's A HER!
and I THINK SHE'S PREGNANT.
don't DO THIS. SAVE YOURSELVES.
I'm GOING TO DIE ANYWAY.
not A CHANCE.
as LONG AS WE'RE BREATHING, YOU'RE BREATHING.
you ARE BRAVE...
but VERY FOOLISH.
just ONCE, I WISH SOMEONE WOULD LEAVE OUT THE "FOOLISH" PART.
Hey, JOE, I'VE GOT AN IDEA.
something THAT'LL GET US OUT OF HERE?
possibly, BUT I GOT TO ADMIT,
it's A LITTLE DANGEROUS FOR BOTH OF US.
everything YOU DO IS DANGEROUS FOR BOTH OF US.
if IT DOESN'T WORK OUT,
do YOUR BEST TO TRY AND GET OUT OF HERE.
go BACK TO WHERE WE CAME THROUGH.
zarkov SAYS THE RIFTS HAPPEN IN THE SAME PLACE.
it's YOUR ONLY CHANCE OF GETTING HOME.
and LEAVE YOU BEHIND?
if IT COMES TO THAT.
don't WORRY, THOUGH. I'LL BE LONG DEAD BY THEN.
take OFF YOUR SHIRT.
that's RIGHT.
okay...
there's MORE WHERE THOSE CAME FROM...
strange. IT DOES NOT ATTACK US.
Hey. HEY, HEY.
chocolate BRINGS WOMEN TOGETHER.
Hey! STRAKE!
get OVER HERE!
you GOT A PROBLEM?
Yeah. AND I'M LOOKING RIGHT AT IT.
get BACK TO WORK. - HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT? UNION BREAK.
you DON'T LIKE IT, TALK TO THE TEAMSTERS.
whatever TRIBE YOU'RE WITH, THEY'LL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN.
piece OF CAKE! WALK IN THE PARK.
Aw, IS THAT ALL YOU'VE GOT?
I'm GETTING BORED HERE!
how'd YOU KNOW THE FLAK JACKET WOULD WORK?
had NO IDEA. I JUST KIND OF WENT FOR IT.
you REALLY ARE NUTS.
it's A CRAZY PLANET. I'M JUST DOING MY PART.
here's YOUR GUN. LET'S GET THESE CUFFS OFF.
here. COME HERE.
here. HERE'S THE KEY.
everyone GET OUT!
all RIGHT, TIME TO BREAK UP MING'S LITTLE TUNNEL PARTY.
I WILL TELL MY BROTHERS OF THE BRAVERY OF FLASH GORDON.
you RISKED YOUR LIVES FOR US.
we WILL NOT FORGET.
neither WILL WE.
take CARE OF YOURSELF, DAREM.
all RIGHT, LET'S FIND SOME DAYLIGHT.
race YOU TO THE RIFT.
tick, TICK, TICK, MA'AM. EVERY HOUR GOES BY, I'M LOSING RENT ON THAT ROOM.
the DETECTIVE WANTED ME TO TELL YOU HE STILL NEEDS IT.
he's COLLECTING FINGERPRINTS.
well... WHAT DO YOU NEED THE TOWELS AND LINEN FOR?
collecting EVIDENCE.
evidence OF WHAT?
I AM NOT AT LIBERTY TO DISCUSS DETAILS OF THIS INVESTIGATION.
but YOU'RE A REPORTER.
I WOULDN'T DO THAT IF I WERE YOU.
the NEXT THING YOU KNOW, THERE'S A NEWS CREW DOWN HERE.
your SLEAZY LITTLE MOTEL? ALL OVER THE 6: 00 NEWS.
a LITTLE BAD FOR BUSINESS, DON'T YOU THINK?
my PLAN IS SIMPLE.
daring, IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF, BUT SIMPLE.
the RIFTS RESONATE AT A SPECIFIC SUB-ATOMIC FREQUENCY,
so IF I CAN ACCESS THAT USING THE PROTON GUN
and INVERT THE AMPLITUDE, I THINK...
I HOPE... THAT I CAN CREATE A CANCELLATION WAVE
that WILL STOP THE RIFT RIPPLES.
maybe.
ugh... IF I AM SUCCESSFUL...
the FABRIC OF THE UNIVERSE WILL BE RESTORED.
of COURSE, IF I FAIL,
and IF THAT HAPPENS, WELL, I'M... REALLY SORRY.
are YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?
zarkov SAID THE RIPPLES HAD A POINT OF ORIGIN,
like THE MOTEL ON EARTH-- HE CALLED IT RIFT CENTRAL.
which MEANS?
which MEANS WHERE WE CAME THROUGH IS MONGO RIFT CENTRAL.
that's WHERE WE NEED TO BE FOR OUR BEST CHANCE AT A RIDE HOME.
well, IF THERE'S A RIFT.
are YOU SAYING WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR THIS THING?
that's THE WAY IT WORKS, IF WE CAN FIND IT.
that's IT? THAT'S OUR MASTER PLAN?
unless YOU CAN THINK OF A BETTER ONE.
there's NO WAY WE CAN MAKE OUR OWN RIFT?
Yeah, WELL, THERE IS, BUT I'D ADVISE AGAINST IT.
zarkov AND BAYLIN ALREADY TRIED THAT AND BARELY MADE IT.
it's WORKING! I DID IT!
Where's FLASH? WE CAN'T JUST LEAVE HIM BEHIND!
we ARE OUTNUMBERED AND MY IP IS EMPTY. ARE YOU READY?
No!
good.
now!
out OF ALL THE PEOPLE YOU'VE MET ON MONGO, THERE HAS TO BE SOMEONE WHO'D HELP US.
well, POSSIBLY.
well, AT THIS POINT, I'D TAKE "POSSIBLY.
you GOT TO TAKE MY WORD FOR IT,
she's MORE TROUBLE THAN SHE'S WORTH.
Hello, AURA. THAT ION PISTOL REALLY BRINGS OUT THE COLOR OF YOUR EYES.
if YOU'RE LOOKING AT MY EYES, I'M INSULTED.
Hey, HEY, HEY!
don't THINK SO.
I'd RATHER TAKE MY CHANCES OUT HERE.
what IS IT WITH YOU AND THE WOMEN ON THIS PLANET?
what CAN I SAY? IT'S A GIFT.
you SEEM TO KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
never UNDERESTIMATE THE EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF CABLE TELEVISION.
I've SEEN A HUNDRED TV BIRTHS.
Plus, I COVERED A TRIPLET BIRTH IN A TAXI ONCE.
I HAVE DEEP MISGIVINGS.
breathe! OKAY...
you NEED TO KEEP BREATHING.
okay...
and PUSH! AND PUSH!
okay, WE ARE DEFINITELY GETTING CLOSE NOW.
more THAN CLOSE.
we're HERE.
so... NOW WHAT?
our RIDE HOME.
what THE HECK? DIDN'T I JUST FRY THAT GUY?
okay, OKAY, YOU CAUGHT US. WE SURRENDER.
I DON'T CARE.
Oh, NO.
breathe! PUSH!
push!
who ARE YOU?
witches!
I BEG YOUR PARDON?
what OMADRIAN MAGIC HAVE YOU WORKED?
we ARE NOT OMADRIAN.
where IS THIS PLACE?
where ARE FLASH AND JOE?
two MEN, STRANGERS ON MONGO.
the VOLUNTEERS?
drop IT, OR THIS ONE DIES.
do YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW STRONG AN ANGRY DEVIATE CAN BE?
what?
Oh, MY GOD.
how EFFICIENT.
I THINK SHE JUST SAVED YOUR LIFE.
uh, WAIT... YOU'RE SAYING THAT'S IT?
the RIFT'S CLOSED? WE MISSED THE BUS BACK TO EARTH?
Yeah, WELCOME TO MY LIFE.
and WAIT TILL I TELL YOU THE BAD NEWS...
that GUY'S IN THE MOTEL? WITH DALE?
and BAYLIN. - WHO?
I'll TELL YOU ABOUT IT LATER.
right NOW, WE GET TO WAIT FOR THE NEXT BUS HOME.
Joe, THERE'S SOMETHING I GOT TO TELL YOU,
about DALE AND ME...
there IS NO DALE AND ME. THERE NEVER WAS.
you TELLING ME THIS 'CAUSE I HAVE A GUN NOW?
no, I'M TELLING YOU THIS BECAUSE WHATEVER HAPPENED ON MONGO,
Dale NEVER GAVE UP ON YOU.
don't GIVE UP ON HER.
breathe!
I THINK I HAVE THE SOLUTION TO ALL-- OHH!
is THAT A DEAD BODY? IS THAT A MONSTER?
a DEVIATE.
Oh, OF COURSE. I-I-IS IT DOING WHAT I THINK IT'S DOING?
birthing. WOULD YOU LIKE TO HELP?
Oh! NO, NO, NO, I-I-I'M FINE RIGHT HERE.
honestly, JUST... JUST FORGET YOU EVER SAW ME.
good. PUSH! YOU'RE ALMOST THERE!
uh, HEY, GUYS. UH, GUYS?
hate TO INTERRUPT, BUT SINCE THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE IS IN IMMINENT DANGER OF IMPLOSION, WELL...
will THAT THING OPEN UP THE RIFT RIPPLES
so THAT FLASH AND JOE CAN COME BACK?
actually, NO.
if I FIRE IT HERE AT THE CLUSTER LOCUS, IT'LL CLOSE THEM.
but BEFORE IT DOES, IT SHOULD OPEN UP A WHOLE LOT OF RIFTS, BRIEFLY...
then SHE CAN GET BACK TO WHERE SHE BELONGS.
how BRIEFLY?
a FEW SECONDS?
if THEY'RE CLOSE TO THE LOCUS ON MONGO, FLASH AND JOE CAN RETURN.
and IF THEY'RE NOT?
I KNOW...
but IF I DON'T DO THIS NOW, NONE OF IT WILL MATTER. SO...
where WERE THE LAST RIFT RIPPLES?
by THE UGLY GUY.
stay BACK!
come ON. HURRY! URRY! HURRY!
it's OKAY.
go THROUGH. GO.
his TURN.
he WEIGHS A TON!
Oh! THE DIGLISH.
ha! THERE'S THAT RIFT!
it's OUR TICKET HOME!
that's WHAT YOU SAID LAST TIME.
what ABOUT FLASH AND JOE?
I GUESS THEY DID NOT MAKE IT.
you're HERE! - YOU COULD SAY THAT.
and WE'RE HERE. IT WORKED!
what WORKED?
I SAVED THE UNIVERSE! TEMPORARILY.
we BIRTHED A DEVIATE INFANT.
it's BEEN A FULL DAY ALL AROUND.
so...
so NOW I KNOW.
everything.
And?
and WE'VE GOT A LOT TO TALK ABOUT.
you ARE SOILED.
where WERE YOU ALL THIS TIME?
giving JOE A CRASH COURSE ON MONGO...
which I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN TO YOU LATER.
right NOW, I'M CRAVING SOMETHING EARTH-BASED,
like HOT DOGS AND MUSTARD AND A DOUBLE-HEADER BASEBALL GAME.
I NEVER PLAYED BASEBALL.
what ARE HOT DOGS?
you KNOW WHAT?
nobody REALLY KNOWS.
my OWN PEOPLE ARE PLOTTING AGAINST ME...
all SINCE MY WATER WAS STOLEN BY THAT ABOMINATION WHO CALLS HIMSELF "KING OF THE DEVIATES"- TEREK.
people ARE ANGRY BECAUSE YOU POISONED THAT WATER TO DISCREDIT TEREK,
and THEY FOUND YOU OUT.
Ah! YOU DON'T FEEL SYMPATHY FOR THAT
at LEAST HE WAS TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE.
open YOUR EYES, AURA.
the STREETS ARE FILLED WITH UNREST.
the CANTONS HAVE TURNED AGAINST ME.
rebellion MAY NOT BE FAR BEHIND.
and, IF I AM BROUGHT DOWN,
you WILL BE RIGHT THERE WITH ME, DAUGHTER.
we SHOULD'VE NEVER TRIED TO HANDLE THIS ON OUR OWN.
if WE HADN'T...
maybe JOE WOULD BE ALIVE.
Yes.
if WE'D BEEN HONEST WITH JOE FROM THE START,
he'd BE WITH US HERE NOW.
there's ONLY ONE WAY TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ALL SAFE.
we HAVE TO TELL THE WORLD THE TRUTH.
huh?
knowledge OF AN ALIEN PLANET MAY BE QUITE DISTURBING TO YOUR PEOPLE.
do YOU REALLY BELIEVE THEY WILL BE ABLE TO ACCEPT IT?
well, THEY MAY NOT HAVE A CHOICE, BAYLIN.
if MING'S REALLY GETTING READY TO DESTROY THE PLANET,
they HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW.
but ONLY IF WE CAN'T STOP MING.
first, WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE HE CAN NEVER ATTACK THE EARTH AGAIN.
how?
we CAN'T BLOW UP THE RIFT GENERATOR WITHOUT BLOWING THE XYRILIUM CORE,
and MAYBE DESTROYING THE ECOLOGY OF BOTH PLANETS.
if WE CAN'T TAKE OUT THE RIFT GENERATOR...
...then IT'S TIME WE TAKE OUT MING.
you THE DOLAN?
I AM.
Yes. I KNOW ABOUT YOU.
I HAD A FEELING YOU MIGHT.
do I NEED THIS?
I AM NOT YOUR ENEMY.
I SERVE MING, YES,
but OUR DUTIES TO THE PROPHECY COME FIRST.
that's WHAT I'M HERE ABOUT.
you KNOW RANKOL?
we HAVE SPOKEN.
he's TOLD ME OF SOME PROPHECIES.
they SPEAK OF SOMEONE COMING TO TAKE MING DOWN.
for A WHILE, HE EVEN THOUGHT I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THAT GUY.
the SIGGNS ARE ON YOU.
you ARE THE WATER BEARER,
the CHILD WHO SHALL REPLACE THE FATHER.
they HELP FROM AFAR. - HEY, NO OFFENSE?
I'm NOT TOO BIG ON THE WHOLE DESTINY THING.
you DO NOT WISH TO BE OUR SAVIOR? - NO!
but IF THE SAVIOR'S THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN TAKE DOWN MING,
then I'M WILLING TO STEP UP.
what WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO?
make A PROCLAMATION. TELL PEOPLE THAT I'M THE ONE.
maybe I CAN UNITE THE CANTONS LONG ENOUGH TO TAKE DOWN MING.
it IS POSSIBLE...
but ONLY IF YOU ARE TRULY THE ONE!
I THOUGHT I'D PASSED EVERY TEST.
there IS ONE MORE.
it IS FORETOLD
that THE UNITER WILL BEGIN HIS CAMPAIGN BY WARMING THE HEART
and EARNING THE FAVORS OF A DISTANT QUEEN.
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR ANOTHER TEST. I NEED TO TAKE MING DOWN NOW.
what YOU NEED TO DO NOW, FLASH GORDON,
is TO FULFILL YOUR DESTINY!
guess IT'S TOO MUCH TO BE ASKED TO BE DROPPED IN HAWAII.
what IN THE HECK IS THIS THING?
Oh, NO. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!
that IS SERIOUSLY WRONG!
no. THAT'S COLD, THAT'S COLD...
that's COLD, THAT'S COLD!
Hey! HEY! HEY, STOP!
stay BACK, BLONDIE. I CAN DEFEND MYSELF.
Hey, I DON'T REALLY DOUBT THAT FACT.
I'm NOT LOOKING FOR TROUBLE, ALL RIGHT?
can YOU JUST TELL ME WHERE I AM?
the FRIGIAN WASTELANDS.
how DID YOU GET OUT THIS FAR WITHOUT TRANSPORT?
kind OF JUST GOT DROPPED OFF HERE, WEARING THIS.
a GLASSINE WEATHER SUIT.
it's NICE EQUIPMENT, IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE.
whoever GAVE YOU THAT DIDN'T WANT YOU TO FREEZE TO DEATH
at LEAST NOT RIGHT AWAY.
LOOK...IF YOU'RE PLANNING ON SHOOTING ME AND STEALING THIS,
can WE JUST, YOU KNOW, MAYBE MAKE A DEAL FIRST?
if I WANTED TO STEAL YOUR SUIT, BLONDIE, YOU'D BE NAKED BY NOW.
I'm BRINI.
why ARE YOU HERE?
apparently, TO SAVE SOMEONE.
a QUEEN.
the FRIGIAN QUEEN?
Yeah.
can YOU TAKE ME TO HER?
I'll TELL YOU WHAT.
you HELP ME WITH MY HARVEST,
and I'LL TAKE YOU TO THE FRIGIAN CAPITAL.
Yeah, THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK. I'M SORT OF IN A BIT OF HURRY.
well...
it'll TAKE YOU ABOUT THREE MOONRISES TO WALK IT.
bit OF ADVICE,
you'll RUN INTO A LOT OF FROST BEARS...
don't TRY TO PET THEM.
something's WRONG.
flash SHOULD'VE BEEN BACK BY NOW.
I HAVE CHECKED OUR USUAL PLACES. HE HAS NOT BEEN SEEN.
you DON'T SUPPOSE THAT HE'S BEEN CAPTURED BY MING?
and MAYBE HE'S BEING TORTURED,
or PUT INTO SOME HORRIBLE MIND-SUCKING MACHINE
I WILL MAKE A FORAY INTO THE PRISONS, TO BE SURE.
this IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
we CAN'T HANDLE THIS ALONE. WE NEED HELP.
flash IS AN EXTRAORDINARY PERSON.
give HIM THE TIME TO SUCCEED.
and IF HE DOESN'T?
then WHAT?
I'm GOING HOME.
and I HOPE ONE OF YOU COMES BACK TO TELL ME THAT FLASH IS OKAY,
and THAT MING HAS BEEN STOPPED.
what IF WE DON'T? OR WE CAN'T?
we HAVE NO CHOICE ANYMORE.
it's TIME WE LET THE WORLD KNOW.
are YOU IN SUCH A HURRY TO DIE?
I WANTED YOU ALONE AND UNPROTECTED...
...so THAT WE COULD TALK PRIVATELY.
what MORE DO YOU AND YOUR KIND WANT?
I HAVE ALREADY ASSIGNED YOU A PREFECT.
that WAS AURA'S DOING, NOT YOURS.
if IT WERE UP TO YOU,
I WOULD'VE BEEN ERASED, ALONG WITH ALL DEVIATES.
and YET...
I CAN HELP YOU.
how COULD YOU POSSIBLY HELP ME?
your PEOPLE ARE TURNING AGAINST YOU,
but IF WE STAND TOGETHER,
we CAN SHOW THEM YOU ARE A BENEVOLENT FATHER
who LOVES ALL OF HIS CHILDREN,
no MATTER THEIR FLAWS.
they WOULD REVERE YOU.
And? IN RETURN?
all I EVER WANTED...
recognition FOR WHAT I AM.
canton STATUS FOR YOU WOULD CHANGE NOTHING.
people WILL CONTINUE TO HATE AND FEAR DEVIATES.
you're RIGHT.
until THEY KNOW WHO THE REAL DEVIATES ARE...
...FATHER.
no...
you COULD NOT HAVE SURVIVED.
but I DID!
and NOW FATE HAS RETURNED ME WHERE I BELONG.
at MY FATHER'S SIDE.
as HIS TRUE SON...
...and HEIR.
never.
I AM NEVER UNPROTECTED.
you SHOULD HAVE STAYED AWAY... AND LIVED.
we HAVE TO STOP DALE...
otherwise WE MAY NEVER MAKE IT HOME,
if THERE'S EVEN A HOME TO GET TO...
one THING AT A TIME. I WILL SEARCH FOR FLASH.
wait, THAT DEVICE OF YOURS...
the ONE THAT CHIRPS WHEN EARTH THINGS ARE FOUND ON MONGO?
the DIMENSIONAL FREQUENCY READER?
it COULD BE HELPFUL IN LOCATING FLASH.
Yeah, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA!
if ANYBODY CAN FIND HIM, YOU CAN. RIGHT?
that's WHAT YOU'RE GOOD AT!
a HUNTER, IT'S WHAT I DO.
what YOU DO...
you ARE A SCIENTIST.
find A WAY TO DISABLE THE RIFT GENERATOR
and STOP DALE.
I WILL LOOK FOR FLASH.
I've NEVER SEEN SOMEONE LIKE YOU BEFORE, BRINI.
what CANTON ARE YOU FROM?
we LIVE BENEATH THE SOUTHERN SEAS.
why DO YOU COME ALL THIS WAY TO HARVEST ICE?
why DON'T YOU GET YOUR WATER FROM MING?
because I WOULD RATHER BE EXECUTED FOR POACHING,
than KISS SOMEONE'S BEHIND FOR AN ALLOCATION.
why I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THE TRITONS FIGHTING MING?
because WE DON'T CARE WHO RULES
whether IT'S VERDEN...
or MING... OR YOU.
it's ALL THE SAME DIGLISH DUNG TO US.
you KNOW, MING STAYS IN POWER BECAUSE OF ATTITUDES LIKE THAT.
I GOT TO GET ONE OF THOSE.
for YOUR TROUBLE.
I HEARD YOU'RE WORKING WITH FLASH GORDON?
keep IT.
tell HIM HE HAS SUPPORTERS.
every CANTON IS TURNING.
I WILL TELL HIM WHEN I FIND HIM.
has HE BEEN THROUGH HERE?
not THIS DAY. OR LAST...
Hey! OUT THERE!
flash GORDON'S FRIEND?
you SAY FLASH IS IN TROUBLE?
Yes, I HAVE EXCELLENT HEARING.
save THE JOKES.
I SAID NOTHING.
get THE GUARD TO LET ME OUT AND I'LL HELP YOU FIND FLASH.
why WOULD YOU DO THAT?
a DEBT OF HONOR TO A MAN WHO'S BEEN A FRIEND TO ME.
I AM TEREK OF THE DEVIATES.
one OF MANY ON MONGO WHO ARE READY TO FIGHT FOR FREEDOM.
when WE GET THIS LOADED UP,
you CAN TAKE ME TO SEE THE QUEEN, RIGHT?
I'm AFRAID IT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED.
what? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
well, THE CAPITAL IS THAT WAY,
and I'M HEADING SOUTH.
but IF YOU START WALKING NOW, YOU'LL MAKE IT BY NEXT MOONRISE.
wait A MINUTE! I HELPED YOU OUT, WE HAD A DEAL!
Yeah, AND I'D LIKE TO RETURN THE FAVOR, REALLY,
but THE FRIGIANS HAVEN'T EXACTLY BEEN THAT FRIENDLY TO ME THESE DAYS.
why DON'T YOU COME WITH ME? YOU'D LIKE THE TRITONS.
Yeah, YOU KNOW WHAT? THANKS FOR NOTHING.
thanks FOR WASTING MY TIME.
fine, WHATEVER. IT'S YOUR LOSS.
ice POACHERS, HALT!
no, NO, NO, NO! WE'RE NOT ICE POACHERS!
you ARE PRISONERS IN THE QUEEN'S NAME!
your CRIME IS GRAVE.
the ANCIENT ICE OF FRIGIA IS MY SACRED DUTY TO PROTECT,
in THE QUEEN'S NAME.
where IS YOUR QUEEN?
taken FROM US, SADLY.
until HER HALLOWED RETURN, I SHALL RULE AS HER REGENT.
count MALO, LET ME BUY THE ICE,
as MY PEOPLE DID WHEN QUEEN FRIA RULED.
Silence!
the ANCIENT ICE IS FOR FRIGIANS ONLY.
if THE TRITONS WANT WATER, THEN THEY CAN GO TO MING.
never.
then YOU KNOW THE PUNISHMENT FOR POACHERS.
you'll BE STRIPPED OF ALL YOUR EQUIPMENT
and LEFT EXPOSED ON THE SNOWFIELD.
wait! I DIDN'T COME HERE TO STEAL ANYTHING.
I WAS SENT HERE TO HELP YOUR QUEEN!
he IS THE ONE?
he IS THE ONE...
this KIND OF STUFF HAPPENS TO ME.
queen FRIA HAS BEEN TRAPPED FOR MANY CYCLES
in HER ABSENCE, IT HAS BEEN MY HONOR TO CARE FOR HER PEOPLE.
you COULDN'T RESCUE HER?
many BRAVE WARRIORS HAVE DIED TRYING.
it IS SAID THAT THE MAN WHO FREES HER
will BECOME THE RULER.
well, NOT EVERYTHING'S PREORDAINED,
but IF YOU LET ME GO, I'LL DO WHAT I CAN DO.
very WELL.
you HAVE MY LEAVE TO TRY.
return HIS EQUIPMENT.
hers TOO.
she's WITH ME.
give THE POACHER BACK HER THINGS.
the SACRED ICE STAYS HERE.
by MING'S ORDER, NONE LEAVES FRIGIA.
mine.
I BELIEVE I'VE UNDERESTIMATED YOU.
what DO YOU MEAN?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE A SHALLOW CHILD...
trying YOUR HAND AT POLITICS.
you KNEW.
you KNEW WHAT TEREK IS AND YOU KEPT IT FROM ME.
what DO YOU MEAN, "WHAT HE IS"?
your WOMB-MATE.
your BROTHER.
and YOUR SON. - NO!
I WILL NEVER ACKNOWLEDGE A SON LIKE HIM.
Never!
did YOU THINK WE WOULD BECOME ONE HAPPY FAMILY,
sharing THIS EMPIRE?
did YOU IMAGINE I WOULD LET ANYONE...
threaten WHAT I HAVE BUILT WITH MY OWN BLOOD?
once HE IS DEAD,
you WILL NEVER SPEAK OF HIM AGAIN.
now COME SAY YOUR GOODBYES.
go!
didn't YOU GET MY MESSAGES? I TRIED YOUR CELL ABOUT 30 TIMES.
sorry. BATTERY'S DEAD.
okay, SURE.
look, DALE, I'M ONTO SOMETHING, AND YOU NEED TO HEAR IT.
I've BEEN LOOKING INTO THIS THING WITH LAKE KENDAL
Yeah, DRAINED IN A SINKHOLE... HOW WEIRD IS THAT?
not WEIRD ENOUGH.
there WAS NO SINKHOLE.
I CHECKED.
and THE WATER DIDN'T DRAIN AWAY...
it DISAPPEARED.
that's IMPOSSIBLE.
Yeah, THAT'S WHAT THE GEOLOGISTS SAID...
before THEY WERE REPLACED BY MILITARY GUYS IN HAZMAT SUITS
and THE GOVERNMENT PUT A BLACKOUT OVER THE WHOLE STORY.
why WOULD THEY DO THAT?
you TELL ME.
there's SOMETHING GOING ON HERE, DALE.
something THAT CAN'T BE EXPLAINED BY ANYTHING ON THIS PLANET,
and YOU KNOW IT.
JOELY, I DON'T... - PLEASE. YOU KNOW WHAT?
while YOU'VE BEEN AWOL,
I've BEEN FOLLOWING UP LEADS ABOUT EVERY ALIEN STORY IN THE STATE.
and EVERY TRAIL I FIND LEADS RIGHT BACK TO YOU...
you AND FLASH GORDON.
I APOLOGIZE FOR THE LACK OF AN HONOR GUARD, BENEVOLENT FATHER.
many OF THEM HAVE BEEN CALLED TO KEEP THE PUBLIC PEACE.
which CELL HOLDS THE DEVIATE TEREK?
I'm SORRY, BENEVOLENT FATHER, I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU MEAN.
he WAS BROUGHT DOWN BY MY PLEASURE GUARDS EARLIER TODAY.
a DEVIATE WITH A DEFORMITY BY HIS EAR!
I'd REMEMBER SOMEONE LIKE THAT.
I HAVE NO RECORD OF HIM.
nothing.
Oh, WHAT HAVE YOU FOOLS DONE?
why, FATHER...
have YOU MISPLACED SOMETHING?
Oh, I SHOULD THROW YOU IN THIS CELL IN HIS PLACE!
and HOW WOULD THAT LOOK TO YOUR PEOPLE?
it WOULD MAKE THEM HATE YOU EVEN MORE, WOULD IT NOT?
what HAVE YOU BECOME?
only WHAT YOU'VE MADE ME.
we ARE FOOLS TO BE DOING THIS.
then WHY AREN'T YOU HEADING SOUTH?
I WOULD...
but YOU SAVED ME FROM AN EXECUTION.
I'm IN YOUR DEBT.
just BECAUSE YOUR POACHING NEARLY GOT ME KILLED?
think NOTHING OF IT.
I WAS TRYING TO HELP MY PEOPLE. YOU'D DO THE SAME.
or DO YOU ONLY HELP FROZEN ROYALTY?
by SAVING QUEEN FRIA, I HAVE A CHANCE TO TAKE DOWN MING.
wonderful GOAL. TOO BAD YOU WON'T MAKE IT.
excuse ME?
no ONE SURVIVES THE ICE WORM.
we're BOTH GOING TO OUR DEATHS.
wait A SECOND. ICE WORM?
just TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW.
a POLICE CONTACT SHOWED ME SOMETHING HE PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE...
Joe's PSYCH REPORT.
where HE TRIED TO TELL THEM ABOUT THE OTHER PLANET?
they THOUGHT HE WAS CRAZY, BUT HE WASN'T, WAS HE?
no.
Joe WAS RIGHT ALL ALONG.
Oh, MY GOD.
Oh, MY GOD! I KNEW IT.
it's ALL TRUE.
there REALLY IS SOMETHING OUT THERE.
do YOU REALIZE HOW HUGE THIS IS?
this STORY IS TOO BIG TO KEEP SECRET.
I KNOW.
but THERE'S SOMEONE I NEED TO TALK TO FIRST.
have YOU COME LOOKING FOR FLASH GORDON?
what ARE YOU DOING HERE?
praying...
for SAFE PASSAGE FOR A TRAVELER.
only THE MONKS PRAY HERE.
you're ONE OF THEM?
if MING KNEW...
he WOULD HAVE MY HEAD FOR MY DIVIDED LOYALTIES.
Yes.
but MY FEAR, OR LACK OF FEAR, CHANGES NOTHING.
destiny DETERMINES ALL.
is THIS YOUR EXCUSE FOR STAYING SILENT
while YOUR OWN PEOPLE ARE SLAUGHTERED?
my PEOPLE"?
must I SERVE THE DEVIATE CAUSE ALONE,
because MY BODY HAS BETRAYED ME?
can I NOT BE A SCIENTIST FIRST, OR A MONK?
I ONLY CARE WHAT YOU HAVE DONE WITH FLASH GORDON.
I've DONE NOTHING.
he IS BEING TESTED.
tested? HOW?
where?
you MUST UNDERSTAND,
it IS FORBIDDEN FOR ME TO ATTEMPT TO INTERFERE WITH HIS DESTINY...
but IF FATE TAKES HIS FRIENDS TO
who AM I TO INTERFERE?
so, UH...
any CHANCE THIS ICE WORM IS MAYBE NOT AS BIG,
or POSSIBLY JUST A LEGEND?
then IT'S A LEGEND THAT'S KILLED HUNDREDS OF FRIGIANS.
but I'M GLAD YOU'RE WITH ME, FLASH GORDON.
thanks FOR THE CONFIDENCE, BRINI.
you're WELCOME.
we TRITONS DON'T LIKE TO DIE ALONE.
BRINI, WAIT!
what?
flash IS NEARBY.
I SEE NOTHING.
the LAST TIME THIS DEVICE DETECTED SOMETHING WE COULD NOT SEE,
it WAS DIRECTLY UNDER US.
here.
those HOULD HOLD.
we ARE SAFE.
you ARE WELCOM - THAT'S GREAT, BUT HOW?
it SEEMS YOU HAVE MANY FRIENDS,
in HIGH PLACES AND LOW.
that's GOOD TO KNOW.
I THINK SHE'S ALIVE.
if THE COLD SLOWS HET,
she COULD SURVIVE, BUT VERY BRIEFLY.
turn UP YOUR WEATHER SUITS AS HIGH AS IT GOES
come ON!
come ON, BRINI, COME ON. BRINI, YOU CAN DO IT.
come ON!
I THINK IT'S WORKING.
it's MELTING, IT'S WORKING. IT'S WORKING.
she's ALIVE.
what?
come ON, BRINI!
stay WITH US. COME ON, HONEY.
and THIS RULER, MING... HE WANTS OUR WATER?
he'll TAKE EVERYTHING HE CAN GET HIS HANDS ON.
and A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL BE HURT, OR KILLED.
unless YOU MAKE THIS BROADCAST AND
at LEAST PEOPLE CAN PREPARE FOR THE WORST.
be READY IF MING COMES.
it MAY BE OUR ONLY CHANCE, NORAH.
after LAWRENCE DISAPPEARED,
the MEN IN THE SUITS CAME,
and THEY WARNED ME TO KEEP QUIET ABOUT HIS WORK.
I KNEW THAT THOSE MEN WERE CAPABLE OF DOING ANYTHING,
of HURTING ANYONE.
we WON'T INVOLVE YOU.
Dale, IT'S YOU,
and ANYONE ELSE WHO KNOWS ABOUT THIS.
halt.
you KNOW, I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU SAVING ME,
but THIS IS WHERE WE NEED TO PART WAYS.
you KNOW, TRAVELING WITH THIS ONE WILL GET YOU KILLED.
one GROWS ACCUSTOMED TO IT.
I'm SORRY, BUT I REALLY NEED TO REACH TRITON ALIVE.
I UNDERSTAND. WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
I HOPE SO.
but YOU PROBABLY WON'T BE.
now WOULD BE A GOOD TIME TO EXPLAIN WHAT YOU ARE DOING HERE.
well, IT'S COMPLICATED, ALL RIGHT?
if I SAVE QUEEN FRIA,
I GAIN THE SUPPORT OF THE CELETROPH MONKS TO UNITE THE CANTONS.
if THE MONKS THINK THAT YOU'RE DESTINED TO DESTROY MING...
then MAYBE WE'RE DESTINED TO HELP YOU DO IT.
but YOU TOLD ME THAT I WAS WRONG TO AID FLASH GORDON.
but NOW YOU HAVE ACTED ALONE, AND SENT HIM TO FRIGIA. WHY?
the FATES PLACED FLASH GORDON INTO MY HANDS.
he IS SET ON COURSE TO PROVE THAT HE IS THE ONE.
then I WAS NOT WRONG?
if HE IS MEANT TO BE THE ONE,
he WILL SURVIVE FRIGIA.
and IF NOT?
then WE'LL LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR OUR SALVATION.
so, WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS ICE WORM?
only THAT NO ONE HAS EVER SURVIVED IT.
this IS THE LAIR.
somebody BUILT A FIRE?
those ARE PULVERIZED BONES.
the EXCRETION OF THE ICE WORM.
I'm GOING TO PRETEND THAT'S A FIRE.
over HERE.
I'm GUESSING THIS IS QUEEN FRIA.
how DO WE GET HER OUT?
the SAME WAY WE GOT OUT BRINI. TURN UP YOUR WEATHER SUITS.
get COMFORTABLE. WE COULD BE HERE FOR A WHILE.
step AWAY FROM HER.
I AM IMPRESSED, FLASH GORDON.
legends ARE USUALLY DISAPPOINTING, BUT HERE YOU ARE.
and YOU'VE ADDED TWO COMPANIONS TO YOUR QUEST
a VERDEN...
...and A DEVIATE, NO LESS.
I'm GUESSING YOU'RE NOT EAGER TO GIVE UP THE FRIGIAN THRONE?
ming AND I DON'T AGREE ON EVERYTHING, BUT...
we DO AGREE THAT HOLDING ON TO POWER CAN BE MOST REWARDING.
where I'M FROM, THAT'S CALLED GREED.
put THEM IN ICE SHACKLES.
if OUR GUESTS WISH TO LEARN MORE ABOUT FRIGIA,
then THEY CAN DO SO ???
they SAY THAT FROST SICKNESS DEADENS THE PAIN.
when THE ICE WORM BEGINS TO GNAW THE MARROW FROM YOUR BONES...
you'll HARDLY FEEL A THING.
it IS DRAWN TO MOVEMENT.
your STRUGGLES WILL ATTRACT IT EVENTUALLY.
but...
this WILL DRAW IT MUCH FASTER.
when THE ICE WORM BEGINS TO FEED,
you'll STILL BE ALIVE.
malo IS WRONG.
our STRUGGLES WILL COUNTERACT ANY FROST SICKNESS.
we WILL FEEL EVERYTHING.
you SUMMONED ME, BENEVOLENT FATHER?
Yes.
I HAVE THE SOLUTION TO OUR CONSTANT SHORTFALLS OF SOURCE WATER.
we WILL SET UP A TRANSPORT SYSTEM TO BRING DOWN LARGE VOLUMES OF PRE-SORROW ICE FROM FRIGIA.
FRIGIAN ICE?
and YOU BELIEVE COUNT MALO WILL SO EASILY COMPLY?
he HAS ALREADY SHOWN HIS LOYALTY BY CEASING ALL ICE TRADE WITH THE OTHER CANTONS.
and, SINCE MALO BECAME REGENT,
queen FRIA'S PEOPLE HAVE BECOME MUCH MORE...
compliant.
begin THE PREPARATIONS.
the REALITY OF A DANGEROUS PLANET BEYOND OURS
is FRIGHTENING AND HARD TO FATHOM.
but GIVEN THE SHOCKING EVIDENCE
that I'VE JUST SHOWN YOU,
I HOPE EVERYONE WATCHING WILL TAKE THIS WARNING SERIOUSLY.
I'm DALE ARDEN, WIAD CHANNEL 4.
do YOU THINK THAT'LL CONVINCE THEM?
it SURE AS HELL CONVINCED ME.
that's ONE SCARY BOMBSHELL YOU JUST DROPPED.
that's THE IDEA.
of COURSE, IT'LL BE BETTER ONCE WE CUT IN ALL THE EVIDENCE
you JUST TALKED ABOUT AND ACTUALLY PUT IT ON AIR.
I KNOW.
just SAY THE WORD, AND I'M ON IT.
now IF WE ONLY HAD A PHOTO OF THE RIFTS...
what ARE YOU DOING?
with OUR TAPE?
I DON'T KNOW.
well... I CAN GUESS WHAT HAPPENS HERE.
the MIND TAP!
Ohh...
would IT BE ASKING TOO MUCH TO FIND AN INSTRUCTION MANUAL?
leave ME ALONE, RANKOL!
I TOLD YOU, I DON'T KNOW WHAT AN IMEX IS.
just LET ME GO HOME.
Dr. HILLER...
is THAT YOU?
I'm SORRY, DO I KNOW YOU?
it's ME, HANS ZARKOV, FROM EARTH.
Dr. ZARKOV?
so, YOU...
you WEREN'T CAPTURED BY RANKOL'S MIND-TAP DEVICE?
you HAVE YOUR OWN FREE WILL? - YES.
then YOU SHOULD GET OUT.
escape WHILE YOU CAN!
I CAN'T...
they MADE A DEVICE
a DIMENSIONAL-RIFT GENERATOR
and I HAVE TO DESTROY IT.
how DO I DO THAT? IS IT EVEN POSSIBLE?
only DR. GORDON COULD ANSWER THAT.
are YOU SAYING THAT DR. GORDON'S ALIVE? IS HE IN THERE WITH YOU?
come ON, GUYS!
don't GIVE UP ON ME!
if WE CAN JUST GET THESE
we MAY HAVE A...
we WILL ONLY DELAY THE END.
their DEVICE WILL BRING THE BEAST.
and OUR INCREASED BLOOD FLOW WILL ONLY MAKE US MORE AWARE,
as OUR BONES ARE GROUND INTO POWDER.
ha, HA! SEE? I TOLD YOU! OW!
all RIGHT!
turn MY SUIT ON.
I CAN'T REACH IT! I'M SORRY.
we're GOING TO GET OUT OF HERE.
something's APPROACHING.
Hey, BLONDIE.
you DIDN'T THINK I WAS REALLY GOING TO LEAVE YOU HERE TO BE EATEN ALIVE?
actually, YEAH, KIND OF, I DID.
I'm HURT.
isn't THERE SOMETHING YOU WANT TO SAY?
Yeah. BAYLIN, WOULD YOU KILL HER FOR ME, PLEASE?
come ON, COME ON, COME ON!
Oh, MAN.
hurry UP! TURN IT OFF!
the ICE WORM IS NEAR.
how NEAR?
very
can WE OUTRUN IT?
I CANNOT TELL WHICH TUNNEL IT IS IN.
we MIGHT RUN RIGHT INTO IT.
we GOT TO DO SOMETHING!
Geez!
BAYLIN... BRINI... GET THE ICE-CUTTER.
quickly.
the SYMBOL, WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
I GUESS YOU'VE NEVER SEEN WILE E. COYOTE?
you're A STRANGE MAN, FLASH GORDON.
why IS THIS THING NOT ATTACKING US?
perhaps IT'S TOYING WITH ITS NEXT MEAL.
which TUNNEL IS HE GOING TO COME OUT OF?
cut IT DOWN! CUT IT DOWN NOW!
okay.
it IS DEAD.
your PLAN WORKED.
you DON'T HAVE TO SOUND SO SURPRISED ABOUT THAT.
we SHOULD REALLY BE GETTING OUT OF HERE.
we WILL.
as SOON AS I FINISH WHAT I STARTED.
ming's PATRIOTS WILL MINE THE ICE,
and WE WILL GUARANTEE THEM A SAFE PASSAGE.
this HERALDS A NEW AGE OF PARTNERSHIP WITH THE GREAT MING.
the QUEEN! THE QUEEN!
not WHILE I REIGN!
queen FRIA.
your MOST HUMBLE SERVANT.
not TOO HUMBLE TO FILL MY THRONE.
or TO STRIKE A BARGAIN WITH MING.
trying TO SERVE YOUR PEOPLE, MY QUEEN.
by CLOSING OUR BORDERS?
refusing TO TRADE OUR ICE TO THE OTHER CANTONS?
well, I WAS ONLY GUARDING YOUR INTERESTS.
you LOOKED AFTER YOUR OWN INTERESTS,
and NONE OTHER.
I WILL LET YOU LIVE, COUNT MALO.
but YOU WILL BE ENCASED IN ICE FOR 20 CYCLES...
as I WAS.
and WHO KNOWS?
perhaps YOU WILL EMERGE A WISER MAN.
no.
no, YOU CAN'T!
No!
No!
you CAN'T!
I WAS ONLY SERVING THE PEOPLE OF FRIGIA!
No!
you CAN'T, NO!
prepare A CELEBRATION!
and FLASH GORDON WILL RULE FRIGIA AT MY SIDE!
uh... WHAT?
wait, WAIT. WHAT?
it IS YOUR RIGHT, AS MY RESCUER.
uh... BUT THERE WASN'T JUST ONE RESCUER, ALL RIGHT?
then WHO IS HE?
you HAVE RETURN
and LIVE
you CAN SAID THAT
they WERE BOTH FROZEN
our PATRIOTS ARE MEETING UNEXPECTED LEVELS OF RESISTANCE IN FRIGIA.
whatever IT TAKES.
I'm WITH YOU, TEREK.
that's OUR TICKET OUT OF HERE.
I WOULD BE PROUD TO SEE YOU STAND IN MING'S PLACE.
I KNOW ABOUT MY MOTHER.
you ARE THE DEVIATE, FATHER.
whoa, HEY, THE GLOWY SYMBOLS. THIS IS THE IMEX.
welcome TO MONGO.
what IS IT? - IT'S MY FATHER.
dad! DAD!
ZARKOV, WHAT'S HAPPENING? - I DON'T KNOW.
it MUST BE SOME KIND OF A SEIZURE.
we've GOT TO DO SOMETHING.
okay, OKAY, A SEIZURE IS...
it's LIKE AN ELECTRICAL STORM IN THE BRAIN,
so MAYBE SOME KIND OF AN ELECTRICAL CHARGE WILL
maybe? - I DON'T KNOW!
then GET ME SOMETHING WITH A CURRENT!
okay.
easy
Oh, NO, OH, NO...
no, WAIT!
how CAN YOU BE SURE THIS WILL NOT KILL HIM?
it WON'T KILL HIM.
we've GOT TO DO SOMETHING. WE'RE LOSING HIM.
I'm SORRY.
dad?
dad...
dad? DAD...
flash, IT WORKED.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY STILL CALL YOU THAT.
Yeah, IT KIND OF STUCK.
we GOT TO GET YOU OUT OF HERE.
if WE ARE DISCOVERED, WE WILL BE KILLED.
this WOULD NOT MAKE FOR A VERY HAPPY REUNION.
okay, EASE HIM UP.
ease HIM UP...
the DEVIATE INSURGENTS HAVE BEEN SPREADING RUMORS
aimed AT UNDERMINING MY RULE.
their EFFORTS WILL, OF COURSE, FAIL,
because THE PEOPLELOVE ME TOO MUCH TO EVERTURN AGAINST ME
but AS A SAFEGUARD,
order YOUR TROOPS TO SHOOT ALL DEVIATES ON SIGHT.
anyone COOPERATING WITH DEVIATES WILL ALSO BE SHOT.
benevolent FATHER,
forces ARE GATHERING IN THE SAFEVELD OUTSIDE NASCENT CITY.
forces?
what FORCES? - I DO NOT KNOW.
they SENT AN ENVOY WITH A HOLO-DISC.
ming, YOUR REIGN OF CRUELTY AND OPPRESSION WILL SOON END,
and YOU WILL STAND IN JUDGMENT FOR YOUR ACTIONS.
your CITY IS SURROUNDED.
surrender NOW
and WE WILL CALL OFF THE ATTACK.
refuse...
and THE STREETS OF NASCENT CITY WILL RUN THICK WITH BLOOD.
their ARMY IS MASSIVE.
with MOST OF OUR TROOPS ON THE FRIGIAN FRONT,
to ENGAGE THEM WOULD BE SUICIDE.
I WILL NOT WAIT FOREVER.
you HAVE WAITED MANY CYCLES FOR MING'S DEFEAT.
surely, ANOTHER HOUR IS NOT TOO MUCH,
if IT AVOIDS BLOODY CONFLICT?
he COMES.
you HAVE THE AUDACITY TO DEMAND MY SURRENDER.
well THEN, DEVIATE...
you HAVE YOUR ANSWER.
there's NO TURNING BACK NOW.
commence THE ATTACK.
okay, THIS DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.
what's HAPPENING?
where IS EVERYBODY GOING?
TEREK'S REVOLUTION HAS BEGUN.
looks LIKE MING WILL FINALLY GET WHAT'S COMING TO HIM.
Yeah, UNLESS WE GET IT FIRST.
so, YOU AND STEVEN,
all THIS TIME YOU'VE BEEN COMING HERE,
you WERE LOOKING FOR HIS FATHER?
that's HOW IT STARTED.
we LEARNED DR. GORDON WAS HERE, BUT WE NEVER FOUND HIM.
do YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?
I'm SORRY.
flash WANTED YOU TWO TO BE TOGETHER AGAIN SO BADLY.
are YOU SURE STEVEN IS IN THERE?
if I KNOW FLASH,
he'll BE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT.
let's GO.
you're ATTACKING THE CITY!
this IS WHAT WE AGREED ON.
just WHAT DID YOU THINK WE'D DO WITH THOSE MUNITIONS YOU STOLE?
you SAID YOU WANTED TO FORCE OUR FATHER TO SURRENDER.
ming HAD A CHANCE TO SURRENDER.
he REFUSED.
I HAD NO CHOICE.
I WANT YOU TO GUARANTEE THAT HE WILL NOT BE HARMED.
I CANNOT GIVE YOU THAT.
we WILL DO WHATEVER IS NECESSARY
to BRING HIM TO JUSTICE FOR HIS CRIMES.
RANKOL, PLEASE TELL HIM THIS IS NOT THE WAY.
TEREK IS RIGHT.
when MING PULLS HIS TROOPS OUT OF THE FRIGIAN CAMPAIGN,
we WILL BE BADLY OUTNUMBERED.
an ATTACK NOW IS OUR ONLY HOPE TO END HIS UNHOLY REIGN.
you WORKED RIGHT BY HIS SIDE,
and NOW, WITH TROOPS CLOSING IN
you FIND YOURSELF ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BATTLE?
how VERY CONVENIENT.
and AS HIS DAUGHTER, YOU KNOW MING BETTER THAN ANYONE.
you STOOD AT HIS SIDE, JUST AS I DID,
and YET YOU FIND YOURSELF STANDING AGAINST HIM NOW.
tell ME, AURA, WHICH BETRAYAL IS MORE CRUEL?
stop IT.
both OF YOU.
this CHANGES NOTHING.
please.
just PROMISE ME HE WON'T BE KILLED.
he's OUR FATHER.
he MAY BE YOUR FATHER,
he's NOT MINE.
how YOU DOING, DAD?
well, ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN THAT DAMN MIND PRISON.
what DO YOU SAY WE GIVE YOU A BREAK?
let YOU CATCH YOUR BREATH, OKAY?
he's DEHYDRATED.
there SHOULD BE SOME WATER IN THE STEEPHOUSE. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
flash, YOU HAVE WAITED MANY YEARS TO FIND YOUR FATHER.
take HIM TO SAFETY.
zarkov AND I WILL GO GET THE PROVISIONS,
and HE WILL BRING IT TO YOU IN THE HIDEOUT.
and I WILL JOIN THE FIGHT.
what? NO, BAYLIN, PEOPLE ARE DYING OUT THERE.
I HAVE WAITED ALL OF MY LIFE
for THE DAY THAT I WOULD SEE MING FALL.
if I CAN'T HELP THAT HAPPEN, THEN MY LIFE IS NOT IMPORTANT.
it IS TO ME.
Yeah. ME TOO.
if I DO NOT SEE YOU AGAIN,
thank YOU.
my GOOD FRIENDS.
be CAREFUL.
you SHOULD BE VERY PROUD.
Hey, I'M COMING BACK,
but JUST IN CASE I DON'T,
take GOOD CARE OF THE IMEX.
all RIGHT, DAD, WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GET OUT OF HERE
before THIS GETS ANY WORSE?
how LONG WILL IT TAKE OUR FORCES TO RETURN FROM FRIGIA?
not MORE THAN A MOON CYCLE.
this CITY WILL BE LOST BY THEN.
have YOU FOUND MY DAUGHTER YET?
we ARE STILL SEARCHING.
find HER, BRING HER HERE.
Oh, HOW THE MIGHTY FALL.
if ANYONE WOULD KNOW, IT WOULD BE YOU, AZURA.
did YOUR OWN CANTON NOT CAST YOU OUT?
on THE CONTRARY,
my WARRIORS KNOW THEY CANNOT SURVIVE WITHOUT ME,
but YOU, IT SEEMS, NEED ALL THE HELP YOU CAN GET.
from A TRIBE OF SPEAR-WIELDING SAVAGES?
my SAVAGES ARE THE MOST FEARED WARRIORS ON MONGO,
and SINCE MY SPIES TELL ME
that TEREK'S FORCES ARE ABOUT TO BREACH THE CITY WALLS,
they MAY BE ALL THAT STANDS BETWEEN YOU AND GRIM DEATH.
tell ME, AZURA...
what WOULD YOU WANT IN RETURN FOR YOUR HELP?
make ME YOUR QUEEN,
and I WILL RULE MONGO AT YOUR SIDE.
then...
have YOUR FORCES SECURE THE PERIMETER...
my QUEEN.
keep THIS CLOSE.
it WILL PROTECT YOU.
I WOULDN'T WANT ANYTHING TO HAPPEN TO MY KING.
it IS NOT YOUR MAGIC I NEED, AZURA.
I WILL DETERMINE MY OWN FATE.
where IS EVERYONE?
didn't ANYONE TELL YOU ABOUT THE WAR?
Yeah, THE BOMBS SORT OF GAVE IT AWAY.
all ABLE-BODIED DENZINS HAVE BEEN ORDERED TO DEFEND THE CITY.
so, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
well, I'M NOT ABLE-BODIED, OBVIOUSLY.
look, THIS ISN'T THE RITZ,
but WE SHOULD BE SAFE HERE FOR A WHILE.
13 YEARS.
it SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE.
then I LOOK AT YOU...
somehow, I KNEW I WAS ALWAYS GOING TO FIND YOU.
I-I DIDN'T KNOW HOW, BUT ...
I KNEW I WAS GOING TO FIND YOU.
your MOTHER...
how IS SHE? - SHE'S FINE.
she's...
she's GOING TO FREAK WHEN SHE SEES YOU.
so, SHE'S NOT...
with ANYONE?
no.
we're GOING TO GET YOU CLEANED UP AND BACK TO HER AS SOON AS I P??
I've GOT TO STAY HERE
and TAKE CARE OF THE RIFT GENERATOR.
it SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN CREATED IN THE FIRST PLACE.
we TRIED TO DESTROY IT, BUT...
the XYRILIUM CORE.
I KNOW.
we're SCREWED THEN?
not IF WE TAKE THE CORE OFF-LINE.
once THAT'S DONE,
there'll BE NO DANGER OF CONTAMINATION,
and THEN...
the RIFT GENERATOR CAN BE DESTROYED.
sure YOU WON'T HAVE A STEEP?
it's ON THE HOUSE.
since WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE ANYWAYS,
might AS WELL GO OUT SMILING.
you ARE NOT GOING TO DIE.
it IS MING TEREK IS AFTER, NOBODY ELSE.
TEREK IS A DEVIATE.
he'll KILL US ALL IN THE END, YOU'LL SEE.
nice TO FINALLY FIND SOMEBODY WHO'S MORE NEGATIVE THAN I AM
for A CHANGE.
good LUCK.
Hey, YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO STAY BACK HERE WITH ME?
you KNOW, WE COULD GET OUR FILL OF VELKEN SNIBS.
someone MUST TAKE OUT THE DEFENSES AT THE CITY GATES,
so THAT TEREK'S FORCES CAN ENTER THE CITADEL.
Yeah, BUT WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE YOU?
who BETTER TO FIGHT MING'S MEN?
and WHO BETTER THAN YOU
to MAKE SURE FLASH RETURNS HOME SAFE.
so, THIS SELF-DESTRUCT MECHANISM,
is IT STILL THERE INSIDE THE RIFT GENERATOR?
well, IT WAS HARDWIRED INTO THE DESIGN.
I MADE SURE IT COULDN'T BE REMOVED.
Oh, GREAT.
then ALL WE HAVE TO DO
is DISABLE THE XYRILIUM CORE,
blow UP THE RIFT GENERATOR,
and GET THE HECK OUT OF DODGE
before THIS WHOLE PLANET GOES TO HELL.
Yeah, WELL, IT WON'T BE THAT EASY.
the CORE IS PROTECTED BY A LOCK THAT ONLY MING CAN OPEN.
well, WHERE'S THE KEY?
he USED TO WEAR IT AS THE INSIGNIA ON HIS JACKET.
he STILL DOES.
Dale, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I HEARD THERE WAS A WAR.
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT NEED THE HELP.
Dr. GORDON?
Yeah, IT'S STILL KIND OF A BIG SURPRISE FOR US, TOO.
well, GET READY FOR ANOTHER ONE.
mom? - STEVEN...
is THAT REALLY YOU?
Hello, NORAH.
Oh, MY GOD!
for EVERY ROMANTIC MOMENT
Halt!
or I WILL SHOOT YOU FOR VIOLATION OF CURFEW BY ORDER OF MING.
trust ME,
you DO NOT WANT TO SHOOT ME.
we HAVE BEEN GIVEN ORDERS TO RETURN YOU TO THE CITADEL.
good.
because THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE I'M GOING.
now, DROP YOUR WEAPONS.
benevolent FATHER...
how CAN I HELP YOU?
you WILL TELL ME MY FATE.
this IS HARDLY THE TIME.
I THINK IT IS.
you RANTHE MONGO STORY ON TELEVISION?
things WERE SO BAD HERE,
and I THOUGHT I HAD TO WARN THE WORLD ABOUT MING,
and I DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU WERE GOING TO MAKE IT BACK.
so NOW EVERYBODY KNOWS, INCLUDING THE GOVERNMENT.
see, THAT'S THE NOT-GOOD PART.
these CREEPY OPS GUYSTRIED TO OME IN AND GRAB NORAH AND I.
somebody OUT THERE DOES NOT WANT THIS STORY OUT.
government SPOOKS.
they'll BE RELENTLESS.
first, THEY'LL DISSECT MY LAB,
then THE SENTINEL, AND THEN MY RV
actually, I'M PRETTY SURE THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO FIND YOUR RV.
I'm JUST SO GLAD THAT YOU FINALLY FOUND YOUR FATHER.
maybe EVERYTHING'S GOING TO TURN OUT ALL RIGHT, HUH?
Yeah, OR MAYBE WE'LL ALL DIE WHEN MING FINDS US HERE.
what DID YOU MEAN THAT THEY COULDN'T FIND MY RV?
everybody ALL RIGHT?
strangely ENOUGH,
I've NEVER BEEN BETTER.
good, 'CAUSE WE'RE GETTING YOU OUT OF HERE.
come ON, LET'S GO.
Halt!
tar DAV TROOVAL.
YELAD TENDASY.
kalla AT TISKA NALL.
go ON.
tell ME THE PROPHECY.
what DID HE SAY? WHAT DID HE SAY?
the FATHER FALLS.
the SON RISES.
a WORLD IS REBORN.
when? - NOW.
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
no, NO, I WANT TO HEAR MORE.
this IS NOT POSSIBLE. TESTIMONY CAN ONLY BE GIVEN
No!
tar DAV TROOVAL.
YELAD TENDASY.
kalla AT TISKA NALL.
what DID HE SAY?
the FATHER FALLS.
the SON RISES.
a WORLD IS REBORN.
he LIES!
where ARE WE GOING?
ZARKOV'S GOING TO FIND YOU AN ACCESS POINT
so I CAN GET YOU GUYS HOME.
no, FLASH, YOU'LL NEED MY HELP.
zarkov CAN HANDLE IT.
zarkov DIDN'T SPEND YEARS THINKING ABOUT HOW TO DESTROY THAT GENERATOR.
I STARTED THIS, SON.
I HAVE TO SEE IT THROUGH.
okay, THEN, FINE, DALE CAN TAKE MY MOM TO THE ACCESS POINT.
I AM NOT LEAVING YOUR FATHER. I WILL NOT RISK LOSING HIM AGAIN.
fine.
then ZARKOV AND DALE WILL TAKE YOU GUYS TO THE RIFT GENERATOR
and I WILL MEET YOU THERE AS SOON AS I GET WHAT I NEED.
is THAT ALL RIGHT?
wait, FLASH, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
I HAVE TO GET SOMETHING FROM MING.
Ming? WHAT, ARE YOU CRAZY? YOU'LL NEVER GET TO HIM.
Yeah, WELL, MAYBE NOT,
but THIS IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN DESTROY THE RIFT GENERATOR.
Dale, IF I DON'T DO THIS, NONE OF US ARE SAFE.
Dale, PLEASE, TAKE CARE OF MY MOM AND DAD.
what THE HELL.
okay, IF WE GET OUT OF THIS,??
your FATE CANNOT COME SOON ENOUGH!
did THE MONKS OFFER ANY NEW HOPE?
I DO NOT NEED MONKS OR PROPHECIES.
there WILL BE NO DOUBT.
there WILL ONLY BE VICTORY.
bring ME MY BATTLE GEAR.
Yes, BENEVOLENT FATHER.
I TOOK THIS PLANET WITH MY OWN HANDS
and I WILL DEFEND IT IN THE SAME WAY.
you WILL SPILL YOUR BLOOD FOR ME
as I...
will SPILL MY BLOOD FOR YOU.
we WILL GIVE ALL FOR MONGO!
if THE ZURNS CAN HOLD THE MAIN GATES
until THE PATRIOTS RETURN FROM FRIGIA
benevolent FATHER, WE CANNOT HOPE THAT
no, I DO NOT HOPE.
I DEMAND!
do NOT MAKE ME SHOOT YOU, FATHER.
I've BEEN SO WORRIED.
you SHOULD BE.
your CITY IS FALLING.
it WAS YOU I WAS WORRIED ABOUT.
where HAVE YOU BEEN?
with MY BROTHER.
is HE DEAD?
did YOU DO THAT FOR ME?
no.
I'm ON HIS SIDE.
against ME?
no...
no, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
??
???
I WILL NOT!
this IS MY CITY.
this IS MY PLANET,
and THAT DISGUSTING FREAK OF NATURE HAS NO RIGHT TO ANY OF IT!
he'll KILL YOU.
look AT YOU, CAN'T YOU SEE YOU'VE ALREADY LOST?
please, FATHER.
do NOT CALL ME THAT.
you ARE NO DAUGHTER OF MINE.
I HAVE STOOD BY YOU,
supported YOU, DEFENDED YOU.
and YOU HAVE TREATED ME WITH SCORN,
murdered PEOPLE I CARE ABOUT,
and YET, SOMEHOW, I STILL LOVE YOU!
how IS THAT NOT ENOUGH?
if YOU TRULY LOVE ME...
why DID YOU DESERT ME?
betray ME?
because YOU HAVE BECOME SOMETHING DARK AND TERRIBLE.
please, FATHER...
TEREK IS TRYING TO SAVE MONGO.
I AM TRYING TO SAVE YOU.
what's THAT SOUND?
machinery.
sounds LIKE WEAPONS FIRE.
no, NO, NO, IT'S JUST BAD ACOUSTICS.
everything's FINE, REALLY.
okay, I HAVE HAD JUST ABOUT ALL I CAN TAKE FOR ONE DAY.
good, BECAUSE SO HAVE I.
I REALLY WISH BAYLIN WAS HERE RIGHT NOW.
wait, BAYLIN?
ZARKOV, WHERE IS SHE? - ??
she's, LIKE, TAKING ON THE ENTIRE PATRIOT ARMY
at THE CITY GATES ON SOME SUICIDE MISSION,
from THE SOUNDS OF IT.
okay, IF YOU GUYS ARE GOOD HERE,
I'll MEET YOU LATER.
okay.
you'll BE FINE WITH ME. REALLY.
your REFLEXES HAVE IMPROVED.
nothing LIKE A LITTLE REVOLUTION TO STEP UP YOUR GAME.
what ARE YOU DOING?
TEREK'S ARMY WILL SOON ARRIVE,
but UNLESS I CAN OPEN UP THE GATES,
they WILL BE SLAUGHTERED ALONG THE OUTER WALL.
what ARE YOU DOING ON MONGO?
here TO HELP YOU.
got ANY IDEAS?
hey...
I've CAPTURED A REBEL LEADER.
she HAS INFORMATION MING WOULD PAY DEARLY FOR.
what INFORMATION DO YOU HAVE?
that YOU ARE GOING TO LOSE.
what IF THEY'RE NOT OUT THERE?
they WILL BE.
it WAS YOU WHO OPENED THE GATE?
both OF US.
then I'M GRATEFUL TO YOU, FRIENDS OF FLASH GORDON.
it SEEMS THAT THE BATTLE IS NOT YET WON.
the PATRIOTS ARE LOSING GROUND.
many HAVE DRAWN BACK TO THE CITADEL.
and THEY HAVE LOTS OF THOSE BLUE GUYS WITH THEM.
the ZURN.
ming WILL NEVER SURRENDER.
once THIS IS WON, WE WILL SEND PATROLS TO SECURE THE STREETS.
as FOR MING, I'LL SEE TO HIM PERSONALLY.
I SHOULD HAVE KILLED YOU BOTH IN YOUR MOTHER'S WOMB!
No!
you...
you're NOT WORTH ME KILLING.
I FIND NO HONOR IN BEING SPARED BY A COWARD.
who SAID ANYTHING ABOUT SPARING YOU?
you DON'T GET TO DECIDE ANYMORE.
it's OVER.
no.
not WHILE I BREATHE.
this IS MY PLANET,
to SHAPE IN MY OWN IMAGE.
you're RIGHT ABOUT THAT.
all THE HATRED AND BRUTALITY YOU'VE CREATED IS FLOODING BACK,
and YOU'RE GOING TO DROWN IN IT.
how I WISH YOU NEVER CAME HERE.
then YOU NEVER SHOULD HAVE TAKEN MY FATHER.
I FOUND HIM, THOUGH.
and I'M TAKING HIM HOME!
and I NEVER WANT TO SEE YOU OR THIS PLANET EVER AGAIN.
the NEW RULERS OF MONGO CAN DECIDE WHAT TO DO WITH YOU.
I RULE MONGO!
??
I HOPE YOU ENJOY YOUR NEW ACCOMMODATIONS,
although THE VIEW KIND OF SUCKS.
I'm SORRY IT CAME TO THIS, FATHER.
spare ME YOUR PITY.
you ARE AN UNBELIEVABLE PIECE OF WORK, YOU KNOW THAT?
get OFF MY PLANET.
the SOONER THE BETTER.
it's ME, VESTRA...
I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS POSSIBLE TO HATE YOU MORE.
what DID HE DO TO YOU?
ming GAVE ME GREY WATER.
to MAKE ME A DEVIATE.
why WOULD HE DO THAT?
because VESTRA IS MY MOTHER.
ming DIDN'T WANT ANYONE TO KNOW THAT HE'S THE DEVIATE.
I WILL NOT ASK YOU TO DEFY THE BLOOD OATH
and CALL ME YOUR DAUGHTER,
but I WILL PROUDLY CALL YOU MY MOTHER.
and YOUR BROTHER? TEREK?
he's FINE.
we've WON.
is SHE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT?
I HAVE TO GET HER FRESH SOURCE WATER AND PROPER CARE,
but MY MOTHER WILL LIVE, UNTAINTED.
I'm GLAD.
my MOM'S HERE, TOO,
and I FINALLY FOUND MY FATHER,
but I HAVE TO GET THEM HOME.
well, WILL I EVER SEE YOU AGAIN?
don't TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY, AURA,
but I REALLY HOPE NOT.
well, THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING, FLASH.
it's BEEN...
quite AN ADVENTURE.
we CAN BEGIN NOW.
is EVERYONE READY? - READY.
well, ALL EXCEPT DALE AND BAYLIN.
don't WORRY, THEY'LL MAKE IT.
they HAVE TO.
start THE ROD REMOVAL SEQUENCE. - RIGHT.
flash, NOW.
everything SEEMS TO BE WORKING SO FAR, HUH?
you COULDN'T HAVE WAITED FOR US?
never DO THAT AGAIN.
at LAST, WHERE I BELONG.
in CONTROL?
no.
here.
with YOU, - AND OUR MOTHER. - AND OUR FATHER.
what ARE WE GOING TO DO, TEREK?
how ARE WE GOING TO CONTROL HIM?
you KNOW THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY.
I WANT TO BE BETTER THAN HE IS.
you WILL BE.
we WILL BE...
but YOU KNOW THAT HE HAS TO DIE.
that's IT.
the XYRILIUM CORE IS DEACTIVATED.
one RIFT TO EARTH COMING UP.
all RIGHT,
mom, DAD, YOU GO FIRST.
we'll ACTIVATE THE SELF-DESTRUCT SEQUENCE,
and THEN BE RIGHT BEHIND YOU.
once YOU TRIGGER IT, YOU'LL ONLY HAVE 30 SECONDS TO GET OUT.
I KNOW, THEN THE WHOLE THING IMPLODES.
I GOT IT, DAD, I PROMISE.
see YOU AT HOME, STEVEN?
wouldn't MISS IT FOR THE WORLD.
Oh, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT...
take THE IMEX WITH YOU.
we DON'T NEED THIS ON MONGO.
I'll MAKE SURE TO KEEP IT SAFE.
quickly. YOU GO AS WELL.
I WILL BEGIN THE SELF-DESTRUCT SEQUENCE.
okay, I'LL HELP, AND THEN WE CAN ALL GO TOGETHER.
I AM STAYING.
what? - WHAT?
this IS MY HOME.
Baylin, YOU CAN'T JUST-- - NO, YOUR HOME IS ON EARTH.
go TO IT. I WILL THINK OF YOU OFTEN.
Hey!
?? - ??
where DID THOSE GUYS COME FROM? - ??
get DOWN!
what, NOTHING?
I've GOT AN IDEA, I'VE GOT AN IDEA.
we SURRENDER!
I SURRENDER!
?? - ??
that's YOUR PLAN?
flash, WE DON'T HAVE ANY TIME FOR THIS!
flash, WE HAVE 15 SECONDS!
go!
come ON!
hurry, THERE'S NO TIME!
flash, 10 SECONDS!
we GOT TO DO SOMETHING.
No!
are YOU ALL RIGHT?
Yeah, I THINK SO.
are YOU OKAY?
Yeah.
if SOMEBODY COULD STOP ALL THESE TELEPHONES FROM RINGING IN MY HEAD.
Hey, BUDDY.
are YOU ALL RIGHT?
you ALL RIGHT?
no, NOT REALLY.
you've MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE.
before YOUR PUNISHMENT IS CARRIED OUT,
do YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY?
is THIS HOW YOU WANT IT TO END, AURA?
she DOES.
does THE DEVIATE SPEAK FOR YOU NOW?
no, I SPEAK FOR MYSELF.
goodbye, FATHER.
finally.
a DAUGHTER I CAN BE PROUD OF.
so YOU'RE SURE THE REST OF THE RIFT BLASTERS ARE DESTROYED?
Yes.
so I GUESS WHEN ZARKOV OPENS THIS RIFT, IT'S GOODBYE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO WITH OUT WITHOUT YOU, BAYLIN.
you WILL THINK OF SOMETHING.
we're GOING TO MISS YOU, BAYLIN.
no, WE'RE NOT.
what?
because WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
the RIFT GENERATOR'S DESTROYED.
the ENTIRE DIMENSIONAL VEIL IS SEALED.
done, FINIT.
Y-Y-YEAH, BUT WHAT ABOUT YOUR RIFT BLASTER?
no, THEIR ORGANIC CIRCUITRY WAS LINKED TO
the FREQUENCY RESONANCE OF THE RIFT GENERATOR,
like AN ORGANIC CALIBRATOR, AND WHEN IT IMPLODED, IT JUST...
okay. OKAY, FINE, ZARKOV, BOTTOM LINE?
we're STUCK ON MONGO...
forever.
we'll NEVER SEE EARTH AGAIN?
or FLASH'S PARENTS. - OR MY LAB.
I GUESS THE ADVENTURE ISN'T QUITE OVER.
in my flash-forward, I was investigating what caused all this.
I seemed to have aidea why all of this was happening.
priority number one-- finding out what caused this.
priority number two is figuring out whether or not it'll happen again.
what if I didn't see anything because six months from now, I'm gonna be dead?
D. Gibbons is a bad man.
Tracy was killed in afghanistan, but in my flash-forward, she's alive.
you're worried your future's gonna come true.
I'm worried mine won'T.
this is demetri. - mr. Noh?
I'm sorry to disturb you, but I'm calling in response to your mosaic board posting.
who is this? How did you get this number?
I can't divulge that, but I can tell you my vision involved you.
go on.
in my flash-forward, I was reading an intelligence briefing, and I am sorry.
there is no delicate way to say this, but on march 15th, 2010, you are going to be murdered.
what?
what the hell are you talking about?
I understand why you're upset, but my hope is by telling you what I know, you will be able to prevent your murder from happening.
your briefing-- did it say who killed me?
I'm afraid not.
well, what did it say then?
that you were an agent from the american fbi, d that you were shot three times in the chest.
you gotta give me more to go on here. What--what kind of briefing was this?
I'm sorry, mr. Noh. I have to end this call now.
no. Waitit. Hello? Hello!
Hello?
we're sorry. Your call cannot be completed as dialed.
come on!
we have to get out.
I'm f-freezing!
at least you have fur.
Hey, nicole, it's olivia again.
look, babe, we're not mad, okay?
we're just worried about you.
so can you please call and let us know you're all right?
okay, we'll speak to you soon. Bye.
man. We gotta cover for nicole again.
I can pick her up after school, take her back to work with me.
are you sure?
we're sifting through blackout intel from interpol and such.
I'll welcome the distraction.
that's aaron.
aaron's coming here?
phone's broke.
said he'd take a look.
I just called nicole.
Yeah, the problem's with my work line.
you called me from your phone, said it was urgent.
now you're lying to olivia?
if you want to prevent the future and save your marriage, first step isn't keeping secrets from your wife.
take that from a guy who's already been divorced, huh?
this is different. It's about charlie.
what happened?
you know she's been freaking out about what she saw, right?
there's a guy we've been investigating.
we've been calling him D. Gibbons.
Charlie's vision had to do with him.
she knew who he was.
she said,"D. Gibbons is a bad man.
how is that even possible?
in my flash-forward...
masked gunmen were comin into the offic maybe D. Gibbons is connected to 'em.
you think whoever's supposed to be after you will come after charlie?
what if this whole investigation circles back on me?
well, isn't that always the risk with your line of work?
and shouldn't you be talking to somebody down at your office?
blackout's changed everything.
I'll tell you what I'd do-- father to father.
if someone's gonna hurt your family, the best thing to do is catch 'em before they can.
the world's changed.
maybe the rules need to change a little, too.
if it were up to me, I'd do whatever I had to do.
so are you flying to home or from?
to.
back to my fianc?
I've been stuck here since the blackout.
but now that the airlines are up and running again...
I hopped on the first flight they were offering.
what were you doing in seattle?
I'm a lawyer-- criminal defense.
what about you? Why are you flying?
I have to.
I'm the C. E.O. Of the airline.
to prove to our customers that the skies are safe again.
how's that working out for you?
gangbusters. Another scotch.
yo.
can I ask you a favor?
sure. What do you need?
I got a call last night from an unknown number.
can you have the tech guys back-trace it through the carrier and see if they can identify the cell sites it was routed through?
what's the priority on this?
nuclear.
how's it going?
let me put it this way-- I miss the good, old days when law enforcement didn't share their leads with each other.
we're gonna be cashing in our pensions before we finish sifting through all of this intel.
kingdom of tonga?
now who knew they even had an intelligence agency?
they're blaming the flash-forwards on phytoplankton blooms.
well, I'll see your boring and raise you an insane.
the flash-forwards were caused by a toxic gas "that was released from deep within the earth as a result of crustal rifting.
so the earth farted, and we blacked out.
that makes sense to me.
at least this one's vetted by our legates in germany.
apparently there's a-a prisoner, a former nazi-- a rudolf geyer
who's claiming to know why the blackouts lasted exactly 137 sekunden.
sekunden. That's german for "seconds.
wait a minute. The guy who sent this in-- do you have a picture of him?
that's him. He was on my board.
we gotta follow up on this.
based on what, mark-- your spidey sense?
something spookier.
the nazi's report...
mentions mark by name.
let me see if I got this right.
we got agents working 247 to identify the two guys who were awake during the blackout.
this week alone I've gotta figure out how to eulogize eight dead agents, and you want to fly to germany to talk to a nazi?
well, a former nazi.
well, that just makes me feel so much better.
geyer requested a meeting with me specifically.
how does he even know you?
I have no idea, but he says he can explain why the blackout lasted 137 seconds, and he won't talk unless I see him face-to-face.
and in the meantime, you're getting nowhere with tracking down suspect zero or D. Gibbons.
N. S.A.'S still working on the suspect zero video.
and we're running down digital forensics from D. Gibbons' cell phone.
for all we know, it's geyer's information that will lead us to them.
book the flights.
I thought I was never gonna see you again.
me, too.
so can I tell you now?
tell me what? - What I saw in my flash-foard.
Zo-- - what's the big deal, babe?
it's not like we didn't see the same thing.
here.
we could talk, or...
or?
or we could go to a motel...
I like your thinking, stranger.
what can I get you?
just a soda water, kate.
what the hell are you doing here?
our daughter's alive, kate.
I saw her during the blackout.
in my vision, I was with her.
she was wounded. I th--I think it might have been somewhere in afghanistan.
are you sure you weren't dead?
maybe you were in heaven with her.
Hey, you might want to check on that with your higher power.
I'm serious, kate. You know what people have been saying.
this thing is real-- glimpses of what's to come.
what's to come?
you want to know what I saw?
this.
I was doing the same thing I'm doing now, same thing I've been doing the past five years.
and those sorry-ass regulars there? They were here, too.
what you saw was wishful thinking.
let her go, aaron.
I can'T. Not when I know she needs me.
she's out there. I'm positive.
she's dead! She's buried!
this isn't about some vision.
this is about you coming up with a fantasy because you feel guilty, 'cause you're the reason she went into the military in the first place.
that's not true. - No, of course it is.
she's daddy's little girl, following in your footsteps.
why are you doing this, anyway?
what do you want from me, anyway?
stop. It's all right.
I just want your signature.
I need you to sign an affidavit so I can exhume her remains.
well, you're not gonna get it, aaron.
why don't you just take this and go?
I'm gonna find her, kate, whether you help me or not.
and when i do, I'll let you know.
that's the second time I've blacked out this week.
now can I tell you about what I saw?
okay.
it was our wedding.
it was on a beach-- hamoa beach in hawaii, I think, where we went last spring.
it was so peaceful.
the wind and-- and the waves...
everything was perfect.
and you saw mehere?
Yeah.
did you see me?
Yeah.
course I saw you...
in that white dress...
barefoot.
baby, you were so beautiful.
it's just like you described.
you realize that's gonna be our wedding day, don't you?
april 29th?
D-DAY?
all that's happened, baby, I'm not sure we should...
commit to a date. - We already have.
so...
can't you just...
fall back...
let the future happen like it's supposed to?
welcome to munich.
agent benford, agent hawk.
Stefan krieger.
I'll be your B. N.D. Liaison during your stay.
thanks for arranging this meeting on such short notice.
you're here as guests of the german government.
as such, you have no actual authority and will proceed with appropriate decorum.
Agreed? - Agreed.
there are a lot of ghosts here.
isn't this where sophie scholl and the rest of the white rose nazi resistance group were executed?
if I'm not mistaken, your country eradicated itindigenous indian population and practiced institutionalized slavery for over 250 years.
we also gave the world britney spears.
rudolf geyer may present himself as a frail, forgetful old man, but I should remind you that he managed telude capture for more than half a century, spending at least 20 of those years within your own U. S.Borders.
he's an unrepentant murderer.
his entire existence has been based on dissemblance and falsehood.
never forget that.
Herr geyer.
gentlemen...
and lady.
I've looked forward to meeting you, herr benford.
how did you know my name?
I saw it iny vision.
you said you had information about the flash-forward, about how long they lasted.
it's not quite that simple, I'm afraid.
you see, before my unfortunate incarceration, I lived in america, and I learned how you can't get something for nothing.
we've anticipated this, herr geyer.
upon verification of your information, you will be transferred to a minimum security facili.
but I had more than a gesture in mind.
I want to return to america, and all charges against me are dropped.
you're dreaming.
I'm not permitting my client to breathe a word of what he knows without getting his pardon first.
I believe we have what's called a game of chicken.
who do you think will blink first?
before you answe consider the fact that I have nothing to lose.
he's playing us.
think about it. This is win-win for him.
at best, he's just jerking us around for a few days' entertainment, and at worst he goes free, and we have no
we'll figure out a way to cover ourselves if he's lying.
no, you heard his lawyer. They're not gonna let us cover ourselves.
mark, this is full pardon or nothing, and that's exactly what geyer's gonna give us.
we don't know that. The only thing we know is geyer's important to our case six months from now, - which mes, janis-- - yeah, listen to yourself.
I am listeni. - Mark, six months from now?
co on. The only thing we know right now is how much we don't know.
mark, you're talking about letting a mass murderer go free in exchange for potentially nothing.
Janis, there are several billion people-- several billion-- who need answers.
that's not nothing.
they need to know why it happened, whether it'll happen again.
the guy makes me sick.
but he's 86 years old. He's on his way out.
and as much as I'd like to personally help him on his way,
I have to ask myself if the ends don't justify the means he.
they never do, mark.
and you know, geyer's age is irrelevant.
there's no statute of limitations on evil.
geyer deserves his punishment, and his victims deserve him getting that punishment, and you can't take that away from them on a hope.
so how's mark handling all of this?
the usual way-- throwing himself into work.
how about stan?
the same.
since becoming bureau assistant director, he's convinced he has to work twice as hard as everybody else in the bureau.
he's pulled two all-nighters in a row, working on this eulogy for the--the memorial service.
like if he found just the right words, he could bring these agents back to life.
well, mark's convinced that what he saw in his flash-forward is somehow goingto save us all.
so mark saw himself saving the world, and what did you see?
Hey, honey.
nothing important. How about you?
I was home.
I was in jason's room, but all of his stuff was gone.
that makes sense. He's in college, right?
he still comes home for holidays.
but in my vision, everything was gone and replaced by a young boy's things.
he was about 8 or 9 years old, and I was putting him to bed.
good night, mom.
good night, attaf.
and you've never seen this kid before?
no.
no, never.
look, people are saying these visions are real.
so I don't know how, but in the next six months, this little boy's gonna come into my life, and I'm gonna be his mom.
I refuse to believe these visions are random.
there is a purpose.
I just--I know it.
we have a compromise to suggest-- one piece of information now and one later.
an offer of proof.
you verify certain aspects of my client's flash-forward, pardon him.
then he will give you the remainder of what he knows.
fine.
the 137 seconds--why?
in my time at treblinka, I,uh, obviously came into contact with many jews.
I also came to learn about certain aspects of their beliefs, their culture
is this going somewhere?
tell me, miss hawk, why do you wear a ring on your left thumb?
what's it matter?
in some eastern european countries, uh, where homosexuality is illegal, a ring on a woman's left thumb is considered an indication of hroclivities.
what does this have to do with anything?
everything and nothing.
I am merely referencing a certain kind of code.
I will now makreference to another kind of code.
have you heard of kabbalah?
it's a set of esoteric teachings-- jewish mysticism.
in kabbalah, everything has a hidden meaning.
is the wordspelled in hebrew.
and each letter in the hebrew alphabet is ascribed a number.
and if you add up these numbers, you arrive at 137
exactly the number of seconds that the blackout lasted.
listen to me the only reason I'm sharing the same air as you is because you said you've got relevant information.
and you've got exactly one minute to prove that to me, or I'm gone.
you won't leave. Not yet.
I have information that'll prove crucial to your investigation.
and I know it, because in my flash-forward...
I was being retriate to the united states, and I had bought my freedom with the second piece of information...
which I am prepared to share with you.
what did you see?
I was in an american airport. I don't know which one.
I was clearing through immigration.
thank yo there was a young man who was processing my documents.
I remember hhad a nametag that read "J. Murphy.
disappointing agent benford's not here to welcome me home.
coming back from germany, ja?
returning home, actually, and I have one murder to thank for it.
a murder?
whose murder this is just our offer of proof. Locate this customs agent, this J. Murphy.
compare his flash-forward to my client'S. Confirm he's telling the truth.
are you enjoying watching us jump through your hoops?
I hope you are. Because you're never leaving this prison, geyer.
I will leave... on april 29th, 2010.
it is a future that has already happened.
I can't believe you're running with this.
let's just see if his flash-forward proves out.
if it does, it means geyer's free in six months' time which means he's telling us the truth.
or a lie we believed.
are you okay with is?
Benford. - Hey, it's me. You got a minute?
Aaron. What's up?
I need a favor - a big favor. It's for tracy.
I want to get her remains exhumed, test 'em against the D. N.A. The military's got on file for her.
Aaron. - Tell you what
I'll listen to any "this isn't a good idea" speeches you gotta give if you can swear you wouldn't do the exact same thing if it were charlie.
okay. You fax over the paperwork. I'll push it through.
there's no paperwork, 'cause it's not signed, and it's not signed 'cause it needs kate's signature.
I need you to push through more than paperwork here.
aaron, that's- - I said it was a big favor.
leaving asid the illegality have you thought about what'll happen if the results come back positive, and the person in that grave is tracy?
I saw her, mark. I saw her alive.
what you saw was impossible.
that's what makes it a leap of faith, mark.
you've never taken a leap of faith?
mark, I'm a little busy right now, all right?
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm-I'm just... everything's fine with zoey.
listen, I'll take care of it. You tell him I'll call when I've got the warrant. Okay.
a warrant? For a customs officer?
no, that'S... something else.
listen, marcie ran through the T. S.A. Employee database, and there aren't any J. Murphys wking customs at any of the airports in the continental united states.
did you check applicants?
no. Geyer said he spoke to an actual officer.
six months from now. Our guy might not be working customs yet.
have marcie check. If she finds something, run it down.
there a problem?
my head's just not in the game today, boss.
Demetri? - Yeah.
get it in the game.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hey!
Hey! Jerome murphy? Fbi. Have a minute?
like, you're saying I make it? I'm gonna be a customs official?
man, I saw it, but I didn't really believe it, you know?
this rocks, dude. I totally thought I blew the physical.
do I get a gun and stuff?
Jerome, I need you to focus here, okay?
I'm trying to corroborate a suspect's flash-forward, and he claims that you were in it.
do you understand? - Yeah, sure. No problem.
what's "corroborate" mean?
I need you to tell me whether you saw the same thing in your flash-forward as this guy claims he saw in his.
I know that dude.
I was working in an airport. It felt good, you know?
badge... uniform... it gave me purpose.
coming back from germany, ja?
I woke up after the blackout, applied the next day.
do you remember anything else, anything odd?
you know, come to think of it, he did. He said something about a murder.
I have a murder to thank for it.
I figured I just misheard him.
all right. I might be in touch.
I can explain that. - That's okay. I know what a bong is.
that's not mine. It'S...my roommate'S.
look, um, home slice, if I get tagged for this, that's it for me.
they won't hire me with a drug bust on my record.
it does seem unlikely, yeah.
but I was doing it. I saw myself doing the job.
I saw myself wearing the uniform, and it wouldn't have happened if you bust me.
I mean, it won't happen if you bust me.
I mean, what I'm saying here is it's up to you whether or not my future happens.
thank you. Buy you a drink?
no, thanks.
to moral relativism.
I'm sorry this is bothering you so much.
Oh, I'm sorry this isn't bothering you at all.
Oh, don't make this personal.
you know what? Don't hide behind the badge.
you're the one driving this thing, mark. You are.
just own it... at least.
fine. I've been driving this. It's what we do, janis.
we cut the dealer a pass to get the distributor.
we let the foot soldier lk to bust the kingpin.
but there have to be some limits, mark.
there have to be people that we won't deal or flip.
and I'm sorry, but if we can't even draw that line at a nazi...
I just don't even know what we're doing anymore.
have you ever taken a leap of faith?
what's that got to do with anything?
I'm pushing this because I have faith that seeing geyer's picture in my flash-forward means his information will be important to us.
well, there you go. There's our problem, because in my flash-forward, all I saw was a baby that I don't even know I want.
so how can I have faith in something I'm not even s then you've got a problem, because that's what faith is.
Benford.
Defound your nazi's customs agent. Same flash-forward.
so he's telling the truth.
I'll put a call into state, have them start the arm-twisting of the german government.
you sure? - Hell, no, but something tells me I better get used to that particular feeling.
we all better. World's changed.
some of us, all of us, are making decisions now based on what will happen, not what could.
it makes us do thing we wouldn't ordinarily do.
you'd think knowing the future would make us less concerned about it.
but just the opposite has happened.
the future's what all of us are living for now. It's what we're living by.
Hey, D. We got nothing on your unknown caller.
tech traced it to somewhere off the new york coast, but from there, they read the signal as coming from two different sites at once.
whoever it was, they know how to cover their tracks.
Hey. Can you pull the L. U.D. S off those two repeater sites?
there's probably a million or so calls routed through those tows.
at least.
you can't do this!
you need my government's consent to free geyer, and my superior
signed off five minutes ago.
Congratulations. You're a free man.
just like that? - Start talking.
I blacked out, as we all did.
the flash-forward happened as I described it.
and then I woke up.
I went to my window, and I saw the city burning in the distance.
and on the ground, in the courtyard outside...
I saw crows. They were dead.
dead crows?
the ground was littered with them.
a murder of crows... - in proper parlance, a grouping of crows.
what the hell does this have to do with the kabbalah and 137 seconds?
nothing, fraulein.
I have no idea why the blackout lasted as long as it did.
so what, it was all crap - the kabbalah, the birds?
the crows are real. They were dying outside my window.
that must mean something. - Tell us!
I can't tell you what I don't know.
please take this. I have no further use for it.
but I believe you will, herr benford.
in my vision, I knew that I'd be freed because of what I told you about the crows dying.
it could be helpful in your investigation.
how helpful it will be... uh, we'll just have to see.
then you'll rot in here until we do.
Ah, my attorney is here to prevent that, herr krieger.
you played us.
the future will tell whether it's true.
but in the meantime, I am, as you said, however...
a free man.
Hey. You look horrendous.
glad I accomplished at least something with this trip.
that badly?
as bad as it could've gone without getting shot at, yeah.
my mom-she always says,"live in the now.
how the hell is anyone supposed to do that anymore?
come here.
what you doing?
what am I doing? - Mm-hmm. What you doing?
living in the now.
living in the now.
I guess my mom's advice wasn't so bad after all.
not so bad, huh?
Hi, jack.
he's been here for a while. Hasn't asked me to pour a drop.
but you can tell he's thinking about it hard.
I can't be too sure since I had a few yesterday, but I thought I was pretty particular about not wanting to see you again.
Yeah.
well...I figured you'd make an exception for-for good news.
you were right.
the body - the mains. Tracy's grave.
you were right.
I'm sorry I went behind your back.
I'm sorry I didn't listen to you.
I'm- - it's okay.
it's all gonna be okay.
none that mean half a damn anyway.
the people we love are gone, and they're not coming back.
we'll miss them.
but things are going to get better. The sun's gonna rise on a new day.
I know it doesn't feel like it will, but that dawn is coming.
there's hope.
one of the agents here repeated to me something that a friend had mentioned to him.
and he said,"we're all prophets now.
you know, I can't think of a prophet worth a damn... that didn't suffer.
and I also can't think of a prophet...
that god didn't love.
good night, mom.
this little boy's gonna come into my life, and I'm gonna be his mom.
absent friends. - absent friends.
how many of these speeches do you think have been given since the blackout?
you gotta figure something like this is happening every day, all over the world.
all over the world.
all over the world. All over the world.
I need your help with something. - What?
excuse me. Just come on.
I'm a raindrop, and I'm falling for you. - what?
that's how you tried to pick me up. Remember?
I would never use that line.
I said, um, you owed me a drink for, uh, edding my ass on the witness stand.
I did shred your ass, but I left all the good parts.
you all right? - Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Let's do it.
the "d-day" wedding. Let's do it.
are you sure? 'Cause the other day
the other day was the other day. I, uM...today...
I want us to make our future happen.
yeah?
baby!
okay, just go with me on this for a second.
it says here that the audubon society tracks bird population trends.
okay, I need you to look up the worldwide crow population for, say, the last year.
there. See that dip? The day of the blackout.
geyer said that crows died outside his cell, but it wasn't just in germany.
crows died all over the world during the blackout.
mark... and I say this with love, who gives a damn?
look and see if the were y other instances of crow populations plummeting like this.
in the ganwar region of somalia. In 1991, all the crows died on the same day.
mark, who cares?
why did we set up mosaic? To look for patterns.
thanks to geyer, we now know crows died all over the world during the blackout.
search on ganwar and the date those crows died.
just one hit.
a C. D.C. Request for additional funding from D. H.S.
you know, mark, this is just anecdotal.
look, they don't even have any corroboration.
no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
C. D.C. Doctors travel to the ganwar region " in response to claims that the inhabitants suffered a mass loss of consciousness.
Janis, we've been so worried the blackout might happen again.
we haven't stopped to ask ourselves, what if it happened before?
southern somalia ganwar region 1991
in my flash-forward, I was investigating what caused all this.
I seemed to have aidea why all of this was happening.
priority number one-- finding out what caused this.
priority number two is figuring out whether or not it'll happen again.
what if I didn't see anything because six months from now, I'm gonna be dead?
D. Gibbons is a bad man.
Tracy was killed in afghanistan, but in my flash-forward, she's alive.
you're worried your future's gonna come true.
I'm worried mine won'T.
this is demetri. - mr. Noh?
I'm sorry to disturb you, but I'm calling in response to your mosaic board posting.
who is this? How did you get this number?
I can't divulge that, but I can tell you my vision involved you.
go on.
in my flash-forward, I was reading an intelligence briefing, and I am sorry.
there is no delicate way to say this, but on march 15th, 2010, you are going to be murdered.
what?
what the hell are you talking about?
I understand why you're upset, but my hope is by telling you what I know, you will be able to prevent your murder from happening.
your briefing-- did it say who killed me?
I'm afraid not.
well, what did it say then?
that you were an agent from the american fbi, d that you were shot three times in the chest.
you gotta give me more to go on here. What--what kind of briefing was this?
I'm sorry, mr. Noh. I have to end this call now.
no. Waitit. Hello? Hello!
Hello?
we're sorry. Your call cannot be completed as dialed.
come on!
we have to get out.
I'm f-freezing!
at least you have fur.
Hey, nicole, it's olivia again.
look, babe, we're not mad, okay?
we're just worried about you.
so can you please call and let us know you're all right?
okay, we'll speak to you soon. Bye.
man. We gotta cover for nicole again.
I can pick her up after school, take her back to work with me.
are you sure?
we're sifting through blackout intel from interpol and such.
I'll welcome the distraction.
that's aaron.
aaron's coming here?
phone's broke.
said he'd take a look.
I just called nicole.
Yeah, the problem's with my work line.
you called me from your phone, said it was urgent.
now you're lying to olivia?
if you want to prevent the future and save your marriage, first step isn't keeping secrets from your wife.
take that from a guy who's already been divorced, huh?
this is different. It's about charlie.
what happened?
you know she's been freaking out about what she saw, right?
there's a guy we've been investigating.
we've been calling him D. Gibbons.
Charlie's vision had to do with him.
she knew who he was.
she said,"D. Gibbons is a bad man.
how is that even possible?
in my flash-forward...
masked gunmen were comin into the offic maybe D. Gibbons is connected to 'em.
you think whoever's supposed to be after you will come after charlie?
what if this whole investigation circles back on me?
well, isn't that always the risk with your line of work?
and shouldn't you be talking to somebody down at your office?
blackout's changed everything.
I'll tell you what I'd do-- father to father.
if someone's gonna hurt your family, the best thing to do is catch 'em before they can.
the world's changed.
maybe the rules need to change a little, too.
if it were up to me, I'd do whatever I had to do.
so are you flying to home or from?
to.
back to my fianc?
I've been stuck here since the blackout.
but now that the airlines are up and running again...
I hopped on the first flight they were offering.
what were you doing in seattle?
I'm a lawyer-- criminal defense.
what about you? Why are you flying?
I have to.
I'm the C. E.O. Of the airline.
to prove to our customers that the skies are safe again.
how's that working out for you?
gangbusters. Another scotch.
yo.
can I ask you a favor?
sure. What do you need?
I got a call last night from an unknown number.
can you have the tech guys back-trace it through the carrier and see if they can identify the cell sites it was routed through?
what's the priority on this?
nuclear.
how's it going?
let me put it this way-- I miss the good, old days when law enforcement didn't share their leads with each other.
we're gonna be cashing in our pensions before we finish sifting through all of this intel.
kingdom of tonga?
now who knew they even had an intelligence agency?
they're blaming the flash-forwards on phytoplankton blooms.
well, I'll see your boring and raise you an insane.
the flash-forwards were caused by a toxic gas "that was released from deep within the earth as a result of crustal rifting.
so the earth farted, and we blacked out.
that makes sense to me.
at least this one's vetted by our legates in germany.
apparently there's a-a prisoner, a former nazi-- a rudolf geyer
who's claiming to know why the blackouts lasted exactly 137 sekunden.
sekunden. That's german for "seconds.
wait a minute. The guy who sent this in-- do you have a picture of him?
that's him. He was on my board.
we gotta follow up on this.
based on what, mark-- your spidey sense?
something spookier.
the nazi's report...
mentions mark by name.
let me see if I got this right.
we got agents working 247 to identify the two guys who were awake during the blackout.
this week alone I've gotta figure out how to eulogize eight dead agents, and you want to fly to germany to talk to a nazi?
well, a former nazi.
well, that just makes me feel so much better.
geyer requested a meeting with me specifically.
how does he even know you?
I have no idea, but he says he can explain why the blackout lasted 137 seconds, and he won't talk unless I see him face-to-face.
and in the meantime, you're getting nowhere with tracking down suspect zero or D. Gibbons.
N. S.A.'S still working on the suspect zero video.
and we're running down digital forensics from D. Gibbons' cell phone.
for all we know, it's geyer's information that will lead us to them.
book the flights.
I thought I was never gonna see you again.
me, too.
so can I tell you now?
tell me what? - What I saw in my flash-foard.
Zo-- - what's the big deal, babe?
it's not like we didn't see the same thing.
here.
we could talk, or...
or?
or we could go to a motel...
I like your thinking, stranger.
what can I get you?
just a soda water, kate.
what the hell are you doing here?
our daughter's alive, kate.
I saw her during the blackout.
in my vision, I was with her.
she was wounded. I th--I think it might have been somewhere in afghanistan.
are you sure you weren't dead?
maybe you were in heaven with her.
Hey, you might want to check on that with your higher power.
I'm serious, kate. You know what people have been saying.
this thing is real-- glimpses of what's to come.
what's to come?
you want to know what I saw?
this.
I was doing the same thing I'm doing now, same thing I've been doing the past five years.
and those sorry-ass regulars there? They were here, too.
what you saw was wishful thinking.
let her go, aaron.
I can'T. Not when I know she needs me.
she's out there. I'm positive.
she's dead! She's buried!
this isn't about some vision.
this is about you coming up with a fantasy because you feel guilty, 'cause you're the reason she went into the military in the first place.
that's not true. - No, of course it is.
she's daddy's little girl, following in your footsteps.
why are you doing this, anyway?
what do you want from me, anyway?
stop. It's all right.
I just want your signature.
I need you to sign an affidavit so I can exhume her remains.
well, you're not gonna get it, aaron.
why don't you just take this and go?
I'm gonna find her, kate, whether you help me or not.
and when i do, I'll let you know.
that's the second time I've blacked out this week.
now can I tell you about what I saw?
okay.
it was our wedding.
it was on a beach-- hamoa beach in hawaii, I think, where we went last spring.
it was so peaceful.
the wind and-- and the waves...
everything was perfect.
and you saw mehere?
Yeah.
did you see me?
Yeah.
course I saw you...
in that white dress...
barefoot.
baby, you were so beautiful.
it's just like you described.
you realize that's gonna be our wedding day, don't you?
april 29th?
D-DAY?
all that's happened, baby, I'm not sure we should...
commit to a date. - We already have.
so...
can't you just...
fall back...
let the future happen like it's supposed to?
welcome to munich.
agent benford, agent hawk.
Stefan krieger.
I'll be your B. N.D. Liaison during your stay.
thanks for arranging this meeting on such short notice.
you're here as guests of the german government.
as such, you have no actual authority and will proceed with appropriate decorum.
Agreed? - Agreed.
there are a lot of ghosts here.
isn't this where sophie scholl and the rest of the white rose nazi resistance group were executed?
if I'm not mistaken, your country eradicated itindigenous indian population and practiced institutionalized slavery for over 250 years.
we also gave the world britney spears.
rudolf geyer may present himself as a frail, forgetful old man, but I should remind you that he managed telude capture for more than half a century, spending at least 20 of those years within your own U. S.Borders.
he's an unrepentant murderer.
his entire existence has been based on dissemblance and falsehood.
never forget that.
Herr geyer.
gentlemen...
and lady.
I've looked forward to meeting you, herr benford.
how did you know my name?
I saw it iny vision.
you said you had information about the flash-forward, about how long they lasted.
it's not quite that simple, I'm afraid.
you see, before my unfortunate incarceration, I lived in america, and I learned how you can't get something for nothing.
we've anticipated this, herr geyer.
upon verification of your information, you will be transferred to a minimum security facili.
but I had more than a gesture in mind.
I want to return to america, and all charges against me are dropped.
you're dreaming.
I'm not permitting my client to breathe a word of what he knows without getting his pardon first.
I believe we have what's called a game of chicken.
who do you think will blink first?
before you answe consider the fact that I have nothing to lose.
he's playing us.
think about it. This is win-win for him.
at best, he's just jerking us around for a few days' entertainment, and at worst he goes free, and we have no
we'll figure out a way to cover ourselves if he's lying.
no, you heard his lawyer. They're not gonna let us cover ourselves.
mark, this is full pardon or nothing, and that's exactly what geyer's gonna give us.
we don't know that. The only thing we know is geyer's important to our case six months from now, - which mes, janis-- - yeah, listen to yourself.
I am listeni. - Mark, six months from now?
co on. The only thing we know right now is how much we don't know.
mark, you're talking about letting a mass murderer go free in exchange for potentially nothing.
Janis, there are several billion people-- several billion-- who need answers.
that's not nothing.
they need to know why it happened, whether it'll happen again.
the guy makes me sick.
but he's 86 years old. He's on his way out.
and as much as I'd like to personally help him on his way,
I have to ask myself if the ends don't justify the means he.
they never do, mark.
and you know, geyer's age is irrelevant.
there's no statute of limitations on evil.
geyer deserves his punishment, and his victims deserve him getting that punishment, and you can't take that away from them on a hope.
so how's mark handling all of this?
the usual way-- throwing himself into work.
how about stan?
the same.
since becoming bureau assistant director, he's convinced he has to work twice as hard as everybody else in the bureau.
he's pulled two all-nighters in a row, working on this eulogy for the--the memorial service.
like if he found just the right words, he could bring these agents back to life.
well, mark's convinced that what he saw in his flash-forward is somehow goingto save us all.
so mark saw himself saving the world, and what did you see?
Hey, honey.
nothing important. How about you?
I was home.
I was in jason's room, but all of his stuff was gone.
that makes sense. He's in college, right?
he still comes home for holidays.
but in my vision, everything was gone and replaced by a young boy's things.
he was about 8 or 9 years old, and I was putting him to bed.
good night, mom.
good night, attaf.
and you've never seen this kid before?
no.
no, never.
look, people are saying these visions are real.
so I don't know how, but in the next six months, this little boy's gonna come into my life, and I'm gonna be his mom.
I refuse to believe these visions are random.
there is a purpose.
I just--I know it.
we have a compromise to suggest-- one piece of information now and one later.
an offer of proof.
you verify certain aspects of my client's flash-forward, pardon him.
then he will give you the remainder of what he knows.
fine.
the 137 seconds--why?
in my time at treblinka, I,uh, obviously came into contact with many jews.
I also came to learn about certain aspects of their beliefs, their culture
is this going somewhere?
tell me, miss hawk, why do you wear a ring on your left thumb?
what's it matter?
in some eastern european countries, uh, where homosexuality is illegal, a ring on a woman's left thumb is considered an indication of hroclivities.
what does this have to do with anything?
everything and nothing.
I am merely referencing a certain kind of code.
I will now makreference to another kind of code.
have you heard of kabbalah?
it's a set of esoteric teachings-- jewish mysticism.
in kabbalah, everything has a hidden meaning.
is the wordspelled in hebrew.
and each letter in the hebrew alphabet is ascribed a number.
and if you add up these numbers, you arrive at 137
exactly the number of seconds that the blackout lasted.
listen to me the only reason I'm sharing the same air as you is because you said you've got relevant information.
and you've got exactly one minute to prove that to me, or I'm gone.
you won't leave. Not yet.
I have information that'll prove crucial to your investigation.
and I know it, because in my flash-forward...
I was being retriate to the united states, and I had bought my freedom with the second piece of information...
which I am prepared to share with you.
what did you see?
I was in an american airport. I don't know which one.
I was clearing through immigration.
thank yo there was a young man who was processing my documents.
I remember hhad a nametag that read "J. Murphy.
disappointing agent benford's not here to welcome me home.
coming back from germany, ja?
returning home, actually, and I have one murder to thank for it.
a murder?
whose murder this is just our offer of proof. Locate this customs agent, this J. Murphy.
compare his flash-forward to my client'S. Confirm he's telling the truth.
are you enjoying watching us jump through your hoops?
I hope you are. Because you're never leaving this prison, geyer.
I will leave... on april 29th, 2010.
it is a future that has already happened.
I can't believe you're running with this.
let's just see if his flash-forward proves out.
if it does, it means geyer's free in six months' time which means he's telling us the truth.
or a lie we believed.
are you okay with is?
Benford. - Hey, it's me. You got a minute?
Aaron. What's up?
I need a favor - a big favor. It's for tracy.
I want to get her remains exhumed, test 'em against the D. N.A. The military's got on file for her.
Aaron. - Tell you what
I'll listen to any "this isn't a good idea" speeches you gotta give if you can swear you wouldn't do the exact same thing if it were charlie.
okay. You fax over the paperwork. I'll push it through.
there's no paperwork, 'cause it's not signed, and it's not signed 'cause it needs kate's signature.
I need you to push through more than paperwork here.
aaron, that's- - I said it was a big favor.
leaving asid the illegality have you thought about what'll happen if the results come back positive, and the person in that grave is tracy?
I saw her, mark. I saw her alive.
what you saw was impossible.
that's what makes it a leap of faith, mark.
you've never taken a leap of faith?
mark, I'm a little busy right now, all right?
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm-I'm just... everything's fine with zoey.
listen, I'll take care of it. You tell him I'll call when I've got the warrant. Okay.
a warrant? For a customs officer?
no, that'S... something else.
listen, marcie ran through the T. S.A. Employee database, and there aren't any J. Murphys wking customs at any of the airports in the continental united states.
did you check applicants?
no. Geyer said he spoke to an actual officer.
six months from now. Our guy might not be working customs yet.
have marcie check. If she finds something, run it down.
there a problem?
my head's just not in the game today, boss.
Demetri? - Yeah.
get it in the game.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hey!
Hey! Jerome murphy? Fbi. Have a minute?
like, you're saying I make it? I'm gonna be a customs official?
man, I saw it, but I didn't really believe it, you know?
this rocks, dude. I totally thought I blew the physical.
do I get a gun and stuff?
Jerome, I need you to focus here, okay?
I'm trying to corroborate a suspect's flash-forward, and he claims that you were in it.
do you understand? - Yeah, sure. No problem.
what's "corroborate" mean?
I need you to tell me whether you saw the same thing in your flash-forward as this guy claims he saw in his.
I know that dude.
I was working in an airport. It felt good, you know?
badge... uniform... it gave me purpose.
coming back from germany, ja?
I woke up after the blackout, applied the next day.
do you remember anything else, anything odd?
you know, come to think of it, he did. He said something about a murder.
I have a murder to thank for it.
I figured I just misheard him.
all right. I might be in touch.
I can explain that. - That's okay. I know what a bong is.
that's not mine. It'S...my roommate'S.
look, um, home slice, if I get tagged for this, that's it for me.
they won't hire me with a drug bust on my record.
it does seem unlikely, yeah.
but I was doing it. I saw myself doing the job.
I saw myself wearing the uniform, and it wouldn't have happened if you bust me.
I mean, it won't happen if you bust me.
I mean, what I'm saying here is it's up to you whether or not my future happens.
thank you. Buy you a drink?
no, thanks.
to moral relativism.
I'm sorry this is bothering you so much.
Oh, I'm sorry this isn't bothering you at all.
Oh, don't make this personal.
you know what? Don't hide behind the badge.
you're the one driving this thing, mark. You are.
just own it... at least.
fine. I've been driving this. It's what we do, janis.
we cut the dealer a pass to get the distributor.
we let the foot soldier lk to bust the kingpin.
but there have to be some limits, mark.
there have to be people that we won't deal or flip.
and I'm sorry, but if we can't even draw that line at a nazi...
I just don't even know what we're doing anymore.
have you ever taken a leap of faith?
what's that got to do with anything?
I'm pushing this because I have faith that seeing geyer's picture in my flash-forward means his information will be important to us.
well, there you go. There's our problem, because in my flash-forward, all I saw was a baby that I don't even know I want.
so how can I have faith in something I'm not even s then you've got a problem, because that's what faith is.
Benford.
Defound your nazi's customs agent. Same flash-forward.
so he's telling the truth.
I'll put a call into state, have them start the arm-twisting of the german government.
you sure? - Hell, no, but something tells me I better get used to that particular feeling.
we all better. World's changed.
some of us, all of us, are making decisions now based on what will happen, not what could.
it makes us do thing we wouldn't ordinarily do.
you'd think knowing the future would make us less concerned about it.
but just the opposite has happened.
the future's what all of us are living for now. It's what we're living by.
Hey, D. We got nothing on your unknown caller.
tech traced it to somewhere off the new york coast, but from there, they read the signal as coming from two different sites at once.
whoever it was, they know how to cover their tracks.
Hey. Can you pull the L. U.D. S off those two repeater sites?
there's probably a million or so calls routed through those tows.
at least.
you can't do this!
you need my government's consent to free geyer, and my superior
signed off five minutes ago.
Congratulations. You're a free man.
just like that? - Start talking.
I blacked out, as we all did.
the flash-forward happened as I described it.
and then I woke up.
I went to my window, and I saw the city burning in the distance.
and on the ground, in the courtyard outside...
I saw crows. They were dead.
dead crows?
the ground was littered with them.
a murder of crows... - in proper parlance, a grouping of crows.
what the hell does this have to do with the kabbalah and 137 seconds?
nothing, fraulein.
I have no idea why the blackout lasted as long as it did.
so what, it was all crap - the kabbalah, the birds?
the crows are real. They were dying outside my window.
that must mean something. - Tell us!
I can't tell you what I don't know.
please take this. I have no further use for it.
but I believe you will, herr benford.
in my vision, I knew that I'd be freed because of what I told you about the crows dying.
it could be helpful in your investigation.
how helpful it will be... uh, we'll just have to see.
then you'll rot in here until we do.
Ah, my attorney is here to prevent that, herr krieger.
you played us.
the future will tell whether it's true.
but in the meantime, I am, as you said, however...
a free man.
Hey. You look horrendous.
glad I accomplished at least something with this trip.
that badly?
as bad as it could've gone without getting shot at, yeah.
my mom-she always says,"live in the now.
how the hell is anyone supposed to do that anymore?
come here.
what you doing?
what am I doing? - Mm-hmm. What you doing?
living in the now.
living in the now.
I guess my mom's advice wasn't so bad after all.
not so bad, huh?
Hi, jack.
he's been here for a while. Hasn't asked me to pour a drop.
but you can tell he's thinking about it hard.
I can't be too sure since I had a few yesterday, but I thought I was pretty particular about not wanting to see you again.
Yeah.
well...I figured you'd make an exception for-for good news.
you were right.
the body - the mains. Tracy's grave.
you were right.
I'm sorry I went behind your back.
I'm sorry I didn't listen to you.
I'm- - it's okay.
it's all gonna be okay.
none that mean half a damn anyway.
the people we love are gone, and they're not coming back.
we'll miss them.
but things are going to get better. The sun's gonna rise on a new day.
I know it doesn't feel like it will, but that dawn is coming.
there's hope.
one of the agents here repeated to me something that a friend had mentioned to him.
and he said,"we're all prophets now.
you know, I can't think of a prophet worth a damn... that didn't suffer.
and I also can't think of a prophet...
that god didn't love.
good night, mom.
this little boy's gonna come into my life, and I'm gonna be his mom.
absent friends. - absent friends.
how many of these speeches do you think have been given since the blackout?
you gotta figure something like this is happening every day, all over the world.
all over the world.
all over the world. All over the world.
I need your help with something. - What?
excuse me. Just come on.
I'm a raindrop, and I'm falling for you. - what?
that's how you tried to pick me up. Remember?
I would never use that line.
I said, um, you owed me a drink for, uh, edding my ass on the witness stand.
I did shred your ass, but I left all the good parts.
you all right? - Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Let's do it.
the "d-day" wedding. Let's do it.
are you sure? 'Cause the other day
the other day was the other day. I, uM...today...
I want us to make our future happen.
yeah?
baby!
okay, just go with me on this for a second.
it says here that the audubon society tracks bird population trends.
okay, I need you to look up the worldwide crow population for, say, the last year.
there. See that dip? The day of the blackout.
geyer said that crows died outside his cell, but it wasn't just in germany.
crows died all over the world during the blackout.
mark... and I say this with love, who gives a damn?
look and see if the were y other instances of crow populations plummeting like this.
in the ganwar region of somalia. In 1991, all the crows died on the same day.
mark, who cares?
why did we set up mosaic? To look for patterns.
thanks to geyer, we now know crows died all over the world during the blackout.
search on ganwar and the date those crows died.
just one hit.
a C. D.C. Request for additional funding from D. H.S.
you know, mark, this is just anecdotal.
look, they don't even have any corroboration.
no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
C. D.C. Doctors travel to the ganwar region " in response to claims that the inhabitants suffered a mass loss of consciousness.
Janis, we've been so worried the blackout might happen again.
we haven't stopped to ask ourselves, what if it happened before?
southern somalia ganwar region 1991
the last time mark had a problem, he was away from me testifying in one of his cases.
why can't you remember everything?
because I was loaded, okay?
before he turned around, the flash-forward ended.
so I don't think he saw me.
his son's your patient.
my son's condition makes him a little hard to read.
Dylan's autistic.
you're panicked over what might happen.
but we've gotta use these flash-forwards to our advantage.
Hey, mark.
we got our funding. Mosaic's still alive.
I know what caused the flash-forwards.
you don't believe me.
well, of course I do.
the world's greatest mystery's been solved by a boozer on a train bound for Los Angeles.
can you connect to the internet with that?
real quick, do an image search for "quantum physicist genius.
go on. I'll wait.
which popped up first--me winning the Robert Wilson award or the jaunty one of me holding lab goggles over my genitals
hold up.
you really... - I'm obviously wasting my time.
I'm sorry.
I've just heard that line a hundred times before.
you genuinely want to know?
of course.
the flash-forwards were caused by you.
it's simple quantum mechanics, really.
whenever a heavenly body carries such an intense force of attraction, the universe just goes... bananas.
sounds technical.
helps if you have a Ph.D or two.
if my calculations are correct, your dark energy could bring about another catastrophe at any moment.
luckily, I've pinpointed the one location on earth that has an irresistible enough force to counteract you.
let me guess
your sleeper car. - Grab your purse.
we've not a moment to lose.
I thought for sure that would work.
maybe for a 21-year-old sorority girl.
but, um, I've learned never to go anywhere unless I'm gonna get the real thing.
the actual cause?
I have a theory, but the, uh...
the science is a little complicated.
I'm a complicated girl.
the most basic concept you need to understand is quantum superpositions.
are you aware of the double slit experiment?
well, there was that one time in college... - What about Schrodinger's cat?
no, I'm not that kinky.
close your eyes.
give me your hand.
okay.
now imagine you have a cat...
B. L.'S a liter in the field and only one P. I.V.
we need access here!
a teeny, tiny cat...
what have we got? - We've got a gunshot wound to the abdomen.
we need to set up a peripheral.
Janis? - We need access here!
that fits in the palm of your hand.
you also have a poisonous sardine.
once we close your palm, there are two possible scenarios.
bring the code cart.
come on, let's go.
clear.
either the cat eats the sardine and dies, or the cat doesn't eat the sardine and lives.
no response.
going again.
quantum physics says until we open your hand to discover the cat's fate, both eventualities occur at the same time.
clear.
still no response.
do C. P.R.
for us, the cat is both living and deceased.
but how can that be?
that's the miracle of quantum mechanics
the observer gets to decide.
the kitty's already made up its mind.
alive or dead?
see for yourself.
Hemoglobin's holding at 12.
Hallelujah.
okay.
Fascia's closed.
o" silk on a driver to dr. Varley.
I'm gonna be honest.
a few hours ago, I didn't think we'd get this far.
close the silk.
let me know when she wakes up.
this is mark. leave it here. I'll get back to you.
Hi. It's me.
where are you?
I have been calling and calling.
I tried Demetri and Stan.
I just can't get through.
I tried the office, and they're just stonewalling me.
after this thing with Janis, I don't know, I'm worried.
can you just call me?
please?
I love you.
I love you.
again, daddy, again.
you're not bored with this one?
No!
cards.
make the cards.
okay.
I'll turn around, and you choose.
so, Dylan, you know it's almost time for you to leave the hospital.
we're gonna go to Palo Alto.
which one?
which one?
did you pick a card?
okay, now look at it and remember.
okay?
okay.
so now it's just you and me.
I was thinking that the best idea is you come and live in my house with me.
no.
cards.
we all lived there before your mother and I...
I mean, you'll have your own room.
it' be great.
cards!
please.
I need you to go along with this.
okay.
uh... is this your card?
it's my house, too.
Hey, buddy.
almost time for trick-or-treating.
that's today?
Yeah, it's the 31st.
it's Halloween. The kids go from room
no, no, no, I know. I just forgot to get him a costume.
um, I'll be right back, okay?
excuse me.
playing cards, bud?
it's my house, too.
how's Janis?
two uniformed cops outside her room.
only her doctor an FBI badges are allowed inside.
good work.
no one will be able to get to her.
but what about you guys?
whoever it was that came after you last night, what's to stop them from trying again?
nothing.
Hey!
are you okay? What happened?
Yeah, yeah. It's nothing. It's nothing.
but you have blood on your shirt.
well, now listen.
there's a room full of FBI agents that need a doctor to tell them if Janis is gonna make it.
okay. - All right.
okay.
we had her in surgery for five hours.
the bullet did some damage, but there shouldn't be any lasting effects.
And?
and she's in recovery.
she's sedated.
we'll know more when she wakes up.
Olivia, you saved her life.
thank you.
all right, everybody, it's been a long night for all of us.
it'll be a while before we know anything more.
the hospital doesn't need us clogging things up.
so I got your numbers. Get some rest.
I'll call you if I hear anything.
you, too, Demetri.
I'm sorry, boss, no.
I'm either staying here to see her through, or I'm going out and finding the people who did this to us.
there are already two dozen agents working this who didn't have a grenade launched at them last night.
now I'm serious.
get outta here.
and if it helps, consider it an order.
you tired?
well, Wedeck told us to go home.
no.
he said for us to get out of the hospital.
it's a surface wound. Just leave it.
are you kidding me? I want to see what those D. C. Doctors did.
Oh, Livy, it's nothing.
come on.
you want to tell me what happened?
you don't... - I want to know.
we were attacked.
um, pretty bad firefight.
Wedeck and Demetri killed one of them.
the others escaped.
it's gotta be connected to the guys who came after Janis.
simultaneous attacks.
because you're investigating the blackout?
why would anyone want to kill you because of that?
I don't know.
I don't know.
still trying to figure it all out.
Oh, see?
I knew I shouldn't have told you.
no.
no, it's not that.
it's... when they brought Janis in,
I couldn't get ahold of you.
my imagination just ran wild
I mean, not knowing where you were, not knowing what was going on.
it was horrible.
but I'm here, and I'm okay, all right?
I'm all right.
we have just been so... obsessed with what we saw, and with the future, with what might or might not happen.
and it's-- It's a distraction.
it's just pulling us out of today, and today, right now this moment is all we have, babe.
it's all we have.
I don't want to miss it.
me neither.
Hey, Dewey.
how is she?
a lot better than these guys.
do you mind?
got no I. D...
no cell phone, no keys.
no fingerprints, no dental records.
it's just like our guy in the parking garage in D. C.
we got nothing.
got nothing.
there's no question now we're up against real pros.
what about, um, medical history, Dewey?
so far just one removed appendix here, one Achilles surgery there.
I'm checking for radial keratotomy scars as we speak.
Hey, Demetri.
yeah? What?
you doing okay in here?
Yeah.
Why?
you put yourself on mosaic.
you think there's anybody in the office who doesn't know by now?
but the point is, you just got shot at 12 hours ago.
now you're standing in a morgue acting kind of weird.
listen, Al, you've been acting kind of weird for a couple of weeks yourself, all right?
um, you want to talk about our feelings, or you want to get back to work?
work sounds good.
this guy's right eye is covered with corneal scarring.
no big surprise there.
what assassin worth his salt doesn't get like?
should practically be a union requirement.
wait.
you see that?
it's like a hand stamp from a bar.
no, it's a blue hand.
it's a clue from mark's board.
something about Baltimore-- a hand--a blue hand.
this son of a bitch is gonna be useful after all.
that costume is super fly.
it was the last thing they had left in his size.
no, I like it. Really, it's cool.
although he doesn't seem to like this very much.
Yeah, it's hard to tell with him.
I think 's mad at me about the move.
Oh, I was just wondering if in the next couple of days dr. Benford might come by so we could, say our good-byes.
Yeah.
Yeah, sure, I'll let her know.
great, thanks.
Hey.
I'm glad she's okay.
Yeah.
it's pretty scary stuff for all of us.
Yeah.
listen, it's been a rough week, and maybe I said some things that were out of line.
let's take a deep breath and get back on track here, hmm?
this only takes quarters.
I got it.
there. - Thank you.
we're even now.
the guys who came after you, the guys who shot Janis-- all Asian.
why don't I head over to Huang's office, see if blue hand has some special significance in Cantonese or mandarin?
Mandarin?
come on, man.
according to the CIA, China might have caused the blackout.
if they did, trying to blow up a team of federal agents seems a little showy, don't you thk?
well, in their minds, I mean, it could be as simple as neutralizing a threat.
well, then why come after us?
the CIA agent who testified at the hearings yesterday is fine, but mark talks about D. Gibbons, suspect zero, the crows for the first time outside of this office, and then eight hours later, it's... China is a dead end.
I don't want blue hand to become one, too.
all right, do you know where you are?
I am in a hospital?
very good.
do you know who I am?
no.
but for some weird reason,
I get the feeling that your husband is a little bit of a neat freak.
I don't know.
something about how he doesn't let his black pens to touch his blue pens.
does that sound familiar?
she's back.
you're an amazing doctor. - And an overworked one.
I wish I could be with you guys tonight.
Oh, we'll take pictures.
can you make sure she doesn't eat too much candy?
sure. - Just, like, a couple of pieces or something.
couple?
20.0
I'll see what I can do.
Bye.
when mark had you pin the blue hand card to the board, he knew it was somehow related to the word "Baltimore."
Yes, that's what I'm saying, sparky.
okay, Baltimore street is 5 miles away.
let's go check it out.
but you were attacked last night in D. C.
so Baltimore, Maryland, is the better bet.
Yeah, but the guy who had the blue hand stamp on him was in L. A. All right?
Baltimore street is in silver lake.
if I'm wrong -- We've wasted an hour.
what?
so you believe in these visions now?
it's--it's complicated.
no, I get it.
I mean, if I hadn't had a flash-forward,
I'd be doing everything I could to prove those visions weren't true.
listen, if we had anything to go on at all here, any real-life lead whatsoever, believe me, I'd be the first guy talking to ballistics or forensics or whatever, all right?
but we don't.
I just want to find the animal that are trying to kill us, and Baltimore street is the only thing I can think of, all right?
so come on.
I'll buy you a pressed sandwich from the Cuban place.
sold.
one out.
super shark has monkey-see and monkey-do in his helmet!
he's trying to eat them!
daddy, that pulls.
just be still. I've almost got it.
I can't believe you don't have a costume.
you always have a costume.
I've been a little busy lately.
I can finish up with her if you want to get in your costume.
Thanks, Nicole, but I'm not wearing a costume.
you could go as Tim-Tim's dad, Jim tim.
what does Tim-Tim's dad look like?
don't say a word, Obi-Wan.
you've got to be kidding me.
was that a kangaroo?
that is the best costume I have ever seen.
Hey, got some milk from the nurses' station to...
I'm--I'm sorry.
I seem to have lost my son.
what's he look like?
uh, he's about this big, uh, wearing, um... well--well, a pimp's outfit.
I mean, I only turned my head for a second.
haven't seen him, but there are tons of kids around.
you might want to check the nurses' station.
okay, thank you.
sir, you don't have to stay here with me.
I'm sure after everything that happened last night, the office is chaotic.
I'm right where I need to be.
I just feel really uncomfortable in this gown and...
I associate those crappy gowns with my wife delivering our son.
after you've seen a thing like that...
was it awful?
just the opposite.
it's... primal.
you feel like you're there at the beginning of something...miraculous... a new life.
you'll see.
what's that?
that little monitor up there.
Janis, I'm sorry. We have to take you back to the O. R.
bring the type specific.
what's wrong? - Your blood count's dropping.
get her on a portable. - What--what's going on?
don't know.
times Square.
april 29th.
the estimates on the mosaic web site have us at half a million people already.
the ball is gonna drop and everything.
half a million people going to their future.
it's a glorified new year's party.
do you have something better to do?
Yeah, you could say that.
who is she?
Oh, come on.
I told you mine.
he... had a neck like an ox...
smelled like a meat locker...
what the hell were you guys doing?
I had my hands around his neck.
I don't know where I was or who the man was...
but I felt my thumbs press down on his trachea...until something snapped.
and then I let go...
looked down at his lifeless body, quite satisfied.
aren't you glad you asked?
I found this on the south exit camera.
Yeah, that's him.
how long ago was this?
17 minutes.
where could he be heed this time of night?
I have no idea.
you getting on? Then get on.
come on. We gotta go.
Hey, kid, you gotta pay the re!
Hey, kid.
you gotta pay the fare.
now do you have it or not?
are you lost?
to our friends at 25696 sawyer court, Los Angeles, California, 90024.
what is he, brain damaged or something?
is he one of those... - I'm gonna put you down like a sick dog if you don't shut up.
it's my house, too.
that's your house?
you know that address?
Yeah, and he's gonna need a transfer.
that's $1. 55.
don't worry, kid.
do you know any magic tricks?
no, Mijo.
I don't do magic.
you said an hour.
it's been over three.
she's back in surgery.
she'll pull through.
Why?
she had a flash-forward, so she has a future?
450 out, and she's tachy in the 130s.
what are we waiting for?
we only have one real option here.
5-0 vicryl.
with all due respect, dr. Benford...- We're gonna do a b-lynch.
did I ever tell you about the night before she and I graduated from Quantico?
no.
we're at some dorm room getting hammered.
I get us a beer. We finish.
she gets us a couple more, then a couple of shots, and, uh,
I'm starting to worry that nerdy little girl's gonna have to have her stomach pumped, right?
there's no guarantee that a b-lynch will contain the bleeding.
a b-lynch is a far less invasive procedure.
gives her a fighting chance of still having a normal, healthy uterus.
Ba next thing I know, it's 4: 00 A. M.
I wake up on linoleum, got a foot in the toilet.
I look over. Janis is at the kitchen table playing quarte against herself.
her insides are stronger than any bullet.
I'll tell you that much.
be honest-- would you be making the same decision if you didn't know this patient personally?
5-0 vicryl.
let me get this straight
you blacked out after five drinks, and they let you keep your badge?
that's... you know why?
because I'm always right about everything.
it's like the hand on mark's board.
trick or treat!
Hey, guys.
dig in, cowboy, princess.
a very cool costume.
And?
Hey!
it's my house, too.
you really should see a dentist.
my parents couldn't afford braces.
thanks for coming out tonight.
I love Halloween.
and, uh, I was worried about you.
it's good to see you out doing normal stuff.
Yeah, I think it's a good idea for all of us to start...
let's get going! - Okay.
paying a little bit more...watch her.
Hey!
stop! FBI! Stay where you are!
same hand, only this one's missing some fingers.
and, um, the other way.
that was the orientation on our assailant.
am I crazy, or does it look like it's pointing that way?
I just threw some toilet paper!
where did you get this mask?
99 cents store, man.
you're not gonna call my dad, are you?
Yeah, Nicole?
I'll be right there. - Makes sense.
you run an underground club, you want to make sure only the right people find it.
if the hand's positioning is the direction, why the missing fingers?
the last hand had three fingers, right?
we just drove three blocks.
that's it.
nice.
I'm sorry to bother you, but I tried Olivia first.
she's in surgery.
you did the right thing.
he came out of nowhere, and he had on this hospital bracelet that I was able to get off and call his dad.
he's on his way over.
I'm mark.
what's your name?
my name is Dylan.
my favorite book is "Harry Potter," prisoners of Azkaban.
my dad does magic.
okay, um, Dylan, does your dad know you're here?
this is my house, too.
no, Dylan, this is my house, and I'm trying to find out how you got here from the hospital.
go ahead. It's your house, too.
how did you know this address?
to our friends at 25696 sawyer court, "Los Angeles, California, 90024.
Hey, Dylan! - Hi, Charlie.
nuts to you, Squirrlio!
toot, toot!
what was that?
it's from the cartoon.
Charlie, do you-- do you know Dylan from school?
no, he's just my friend.
what?
hello.
I think my son is here.
Yeah, he's right here.
come on in.
Oh, my god. Are you all right?
he seems fine. - He just slipped out of the hospital.
I-I can't believe he'd just wander off.
um, thank you for taking such good care of him...Mr...
and I didn't catch your name.
this is my son Dylan.
wait.
are you somehow related to Olivia -- dr. Benford?
I'm her husband.
of-- of course.
that-- that makes perfect sense
your name being Benford, her name being Benford.
trick or treat!
Hey, honey.
you're her.
not yet.
you know, Charlie... Why don't we double check your candy in the kitchen?
Nicole, you want to come? - good idea.
what's going on?
I thought you might know.
Dylan came here.
Why?
this is my house, too.
it's your house, too, Dylan.
he keeps saying that.
Dylan is autistic the repetitive speech... - I don't need a diagnosis.
now I understand.
what?
why I made her-- Why I made you so
uncomfortable? - Yes.
okay, clearly, um, this is an unusual situation.
no kidding. - Mark, don't be like that.
I can make this comfortable for everybody.
you leave... you don't come back.
I'm very sorry if we've caused you any inconvenience.
thank you... both... for the kindness you've shown Dylan.
thank you.
it's my house, too.
good night, Olivia.
come on, Dylan.
let's go. - Good night, Dylan.
looks like the party's over.
definitely over.
this came from a friend of yours named Maya... worried about you.
you okay?
when I got shot...
the bullet... bounced around all over the place.
the only thing they said they could do without taking the whole thing out...
Olivia did this thing called a b-lynch.
but with all the scarring...
they said that it's gonna be almost impossible...
why am I crying?
I never even wanted to have a baby.
it's gonna be all right.
I can see why you like him. He's very charming.
I don't like M. Come on.
can you stop so we can actually talk about this?
I don't like him.
he's the father of one of my patients. - I know who he is.
what I want to know is how his son found his way here.
I have no idea.
Really?
Yeah.
well, I'm a little confused, because I thought you said you had Dylan moved off your rotation.
I did.
you did?
then why are you listed as the attending on his wristband?
Oh, god.
I had nothing to do with that. My boss made the decision.
your boss also tell you not to say anything about it?
no, I didn't say anything about it because I thought it would make a horrendous situation that much worse.
Oh, so you thought hiding it was a better plan.
that's not what was going on, mark.
don't turn me into someone I'm not.
don't you turn this around and make it about me.
the man you might be sleeping with in six months' time was just in our living room, and I sure as hell didn't bring him into our lives.
you did!
that's not fair.
just be honest.
just be honest.
have -- have you been talking to him at work?
Oh, come on!
come on, Mark.
have you done anything else I should know about?
mark, don't interrogate me.
then be honest with me!
I am!
are you being honest with me?
Oh, what are you talking about?
all the old patterns are back, mark.
you're out of the house all the time.
you're more and more secretive.
so I'm asking you the same thing that you asked me... be honest.
are you hiding anything from me?
in my flash-forward... I was drinking.
here we are again.
Olivia this isn't like before.
the lying's already started.
what?
no, it hasn't.
this isn't the same. Don't condemn me for something I haven't done yet.
did you even hear what you just said?
you've been punishing me this whole time for an imaginary relationship.
but when it comes back to you, you want to be let off the hook.
but our past together, mark-- all we've been through with your drinking... that's real.
that still hurts.
I'm not going through it again.
I promise you... I'm not gonna drink.
but it's not about the drinking.
you know that.
it's about trust.
it's about trust, and we don't trust each other anymore.
so, everything we said at the hospital today about only living in the moment, well... all that was a lie?
it's not a lie.
it's what I want.
I just don't know if it's possible anymore...
not now... not with us.
Hey, Demetri?
am I missing something?
I mean, on the same night our guy tries to kill Janis, he's hanging out here?
I don't know, but they found this on one of the bodies.
remember the Rutherford case?
we were talking about a case that I don't think even exists yet -- the Rutherford case.
it begins tonight.
all right.
it was quite a day, huh?
is it gonna be Halloween again tomorrow?
no.
just today.
good, 'cause it was kind of scary.
Yeah.
Yes, it was.
I'll see you in the morning.
thanks for coming to get me, daddy.
Oh, damn it, Simon. You scared me half to death.
did you ever take the train down the coast, Loyd?
breathtaking.
what do you want?
you disappear to Los Angeles.
you don't return my calls.
I'm worried about you.
we all are.
Yeah, well, I made it perfectly clear I don't want to see any of you right now.
I don't care.
we have to talk.
our experiment killed 20 million people, Simon.
what more is there to say?
the whole world saw the future.
the last time Mark had a problem,
he was away from home testifying in one of his cases.
why can't you remember everything?
because I was loaded, okay?
before he turned around, the flash-forward ended.
so I don't think he saw me. His son's your patient.
my son's condition makes him a little hard to read.
Dylan's autistic.
you're panicked over what might happen.
but we've gotta use these flash-forwards to our advantage.
Hey, Mark. -- We got our funding.
Mosaic's still alive.
mark?
I know what caused the flash-forwards.
you don't believe me.
well, of course I do.
the world's greatest mystery's been solved by a boozer on a train bound for Los Angeles.
can you connect to the internet with that?
real quick, do an image search.
for "quantum physicist genius."
go on. I'll wait.
which popped up first?
me winning the Robert Wilson Award.
or the jaunty one of me holding lab goggles over my genitals?
hold up. You really.
I'm obviously wasting my time.
I'm sorry. I've just heard that line a hundred times before.
you genuinely want to know? -- Of course.
the flash-forwards were caused by you.
it's simple quantum mechanics, really.
whenever a heavenly body carries such an intense force of attraction, the universe just goes... bananas.
sounds technical. -- Helps if you have a Ph. D or two.
if my calculations are correct,
your dark energy could bring about another catastrophe at any moment.
luckily, I've pinpointed the one location on earth.
that has an irresistible enough force to counteract you.
let me guess- your sleeper car.
grab your purse. We've not a moment to lose.
I thought for sure that would work.
maybe for a 21-year-old sorority girl.
but, um, I've learned never to go anywhere unless I'm gonna get the real thing.
the actual cause?
I have a theory, but the, uh...
the science is a little complicated.
I'm a complicated girl.
I can handle that.
the most basic concept you need to understand is quantum superpositions.
are you aware of the double slit experiment?
well, there was that one time in college...
what about Schrodinger's cat? -- No, I'm not that kinky.
close your eyes.
give me your hand.
okay. Now imagine you have a cat...
B.l.'s a liter in the field and only one P.I.V.
we need access here!
a teeny, tiny cat...
what have we got?
we've got a gunshot wound to the abdomen.
we need to set up a peripheral.
we need access here! -- Janis?
that fits in the palm of your hand.
you also have a poisonous sardine.
once we close your palm,
there are two possible scenarios.
bring the code cart. Come on. Let's go.
clear.
either the cat eats the sardine and dies, or that doesn't eat the sardine and lives.
no response. -- Going again.
quantum physics says,
until we open your hand to discover the cat's fate,
both eventualities occur at the same time.
clear.
still no response.
do C.P.R.
for us, the cat is both living and deceased.
but how can that be?
that's the miracle of quantum mechanics.
the observer gets to decide.
the kitty's already made up its mind.
alive or dead?
see for yourself.
Hemoglobin's holding at 12.
Hallelujah.
okay. Fascia's closed.
silk on a driver to Dr. Varley.
I'm gonna be honest.
a few hours ago, I didn't think we'd get this far.
close the skin. Let me know when she wakes up.
this is Mark.
leave it here. I'll get back to you.
Hi, it's me. Where are you?
I have been calling and calling.
I tried Demetri and Stan. I just can't get through.
I tried the office, and they're just stonewalling me.
after this thing with Janis,
I don't know, I'm worried.
can you just call me?
please?
I love you.
I love you.
mark was drinking in his Flash Forward.
again, Daddy, again.
you're not bored with this one?
No! Cards. Make the cards.
okay. I'll turn around, and you choose.
so, Dylan,
you know it's almost time for you to leave the hospital.
we're gonna go to Palo Alto.
which one?
which one?
did you pick a card? -- Uh-huh.
okay, now look at it and remember.
okay?
okay.
so now it's just you and me.
I was thinking that the best idea is you come and live in my house with me.
no.
Dylan.
cards.
we all lived there before your mother and I...
I mean, you'll have your own room. It'll be great.
cards!
please. I need you to go along with this.
um, okay. Uh...
is this your card?
it's my house, too.
Hey, buddy. Almost time for trick-or-treating.
that's today? -- Yeah, it's the 31st. It's Halloween.
the kids go from room. -- No, no, no, I know.
I just forgot to get him a costume.
um, I'll be right back, okay?
excuse me.
playing cards, bud?
it's my house, too.
how's Janis?
two uniformed cops outside her room.
only her doctor and FBI badges are allowed inside.
good work.
no one will be able to get to her.
but what about you guys?
whoever it was that came after you last night,
what's to stop them from trying again?
nothing.
are you okay? What happened?
Yeah, yeah. It's nothing. It's nothing.
but you have blood on your shirt.
well, now listen. Listen.
there's a room full of FBI agents that need a doctor to tell them if Janis is gonna make it.
Oh. Okay. - All right.
okay, okay, okay.
okay.
we had her in surgery for five hours.
the bullet did some damage, but there shouldn't be - any lasting effects. -- And?
and she's in recovery. She's sedated.
we'll know more when she wakes up.
Olivia, you saved her life. Thank you.
all right, everybody, it's been a long night for all of us.
it'll be a while before we know anything more.
the hospital doesn't need us clogging things up.
so I got your numbers. Get some rest.
I'll call you if I hear anything. You, too, Demetri.
I'm sorry, boss, no.
I'm either staying here to see her through,
or I'm going out and finding the people who did this to us.
there are already two dozen agents working this who didn't have a grenade launched at them last night.
now I'm serious. Get outta here.
and if it helps, consider it an order.
come on.
you tired?
well, Wedeck told us to go home.
no. He said for us to get out of the hospital.
it's a surface wound. Just leave it. -- Are you kidding me?
I want to see what those D.C. doctors did.
Oh, Olivia, it's nothing.
come on. You want to tell me what happened?
you don't... --I want to know.
we were attacked.
um, pretty bad firefight.
Wedeck and Demetri killed two of them.
the others escaped.
it's gotta be connected to the guys who came after Janis.
simultaneous attacks.
because you're investigating the blackout?
why would anyone want to kill you because of that?
I don't know. I don't know.
still trying to figure it all out.
Oh, see? I knew I shouldn't have told you.
no.
no, it's not that.
It's...When they brought Janis in,
I couldn't get a hold of you.
my imagination just ran wild.
I mean, not knowing where you were,
not knowing what was going on.
it was horrible.
but I'm here. And I'm okay, all right?
I'm all right.
we have just been so... obsessed with what we saw,
and with the future,
with what might or might not happen.
and it's-- it's a distraction.
it's just pulling us out of today, and today, right now,
this moment is all we have, babe.
it's all we have.
I don't want to miss it.
me neither.
department of Coroner
Hey, Dewey.
how is she?
a lot better than these guys. Atta girl, Janis.
do you mind?
got no ID...
no cell phone, no keys.
no fingerprints, no dental records.
it's just like our guy in the parking garage in D.C.
we got nothing.
got nothing.
there's no question now we're up against real pros.
what about, um, medical history, Dewey?
so far just one removed appendix here,
one achilles surgery there.
I'm checking for radial keratotomy scars as we speak.
Hey, Demetri.
Demetri.
yeah? What?
you doing okay in here?
Yeah. Why?
you put yourself on Mosaic.
you think there's anybody in the office who doesn't know by now?
but the point is, you just got shot at 12 hours ago.
now you're standing in a morgue acting kind of weird.
listen, Al, you've been acting kind of weird for a couple of weeks yourself, all right?
so, um, you want to talk about our feelings, - Or you want to get back to work? -- Work sounds good.
this guy's right eye is covered with corneal scarring.
no big surprise there.
what assassin worth his salt doesn't get LASIK?
should practically be a union requirement.
wait.
you see that? -- Looks like a hand stamp from a bar.
no, it's a blue hand.
it's a clue from Mark's board.
something about Baltimore? --A hand-a blue hand.
this son of a bitch is gonna be useful after all.
that costume is Super Fly.
it was the last thing they had left in his size.
no, I like it. Really, it's cool.
although he doesn't seem to like this very much.
Yeah, it's hard to tell with him.
I think's mad at me about the move.
Oh, I was just wondering if in the next couple of days, Dr. Benford might come by so we could, uh, say our good-byes.
Yeah, yeah, sure, I'll let her know. - Great, thanks.
I'm glad she's okay.
Yeah. It's pretty scary stuff for all of us.
Yeah.
listen, it's been a rough week,
and maybe I said some things that were out of line.
let's take a deep breath and get back on track here, hmm?
Ohh. This only takes quarters.
Mm-hmm. I got it.
there. -- Thank you.
we're even now.
the guys who came after you,
the guys who shot Janis- all Asian.
why don't I head over to Huang's office?
see if blue hand has some special significance - in Cantonese or Mandarin? - Mandarin? Come on, man.
according to the CIA,
china might have caused the blackout.
if they did, trying to blow up a team of Federal agents seems a little showy, don't you think?
well, in their minds, I mean,
it could be as simple as neutralizing a threat.
well, then why come after us?
the CIA agent who testified at the hearings yesterday is fine, but Mark talks about D. Gibbons, Suspect Zero, the crows for the first time outside of this office,
